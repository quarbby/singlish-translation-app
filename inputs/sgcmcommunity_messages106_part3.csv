eg compare power  fuel economy all these,btohqsg
with an exchange rate of 1:3.2,btohqsg
1.71 which is still cheaper than 98 in SG,btohqsg
So mean.. I feel excluded now 😢😢,btohqsg
Wait!!!! ARE WE FROM THE SAME VILLAGE!!??,btohqsg
I a bit confused sir… why you avoid shell because they sell premium fuel v racing? You can pump their lower grades mah? So easy. All colour coded and all.,btohqsg
Actually  what car are you driving sir?,btohqsg
Wa bro ultimately im still a Singaporean siaaaaa  born and bred,btohqsg
car is irrelevant... brain is pretty crucial,btohqsg
is like me blacklisting mcdonald's because they sell filet o fish and i don't eat fish,btohqsg
Or I shun Singapore Airlines because they have First Class seats and I don’t want to pay money for First Class ticket.,btohqsg
What if I accidentally click to buy First Class ticket then how?,btohqsg
I Indian Villager but you and I also same same dei. Both citizens of this wonderful 🌍 (and SGCM Community)!,btohqsg
I wanna be so rich that I didn’t even realise I accidentally bought first class tickets,btohqsg
I chinese lah! 😂😂 but this is Singapore where Singlish rules the land HAAHHA,btohqsg
I wanna be so rich that I didn’t even realise I accidentally bought v racing,btohqsg
I wanna be rich and just go airport find a random counter and ask  u got seats?,btohqsg
I wanna be rich and just go kopitiam find a random stall and ask  u got food?,btohqsg
Now I need to be careful which coffee shop I go to… I only go those that sell $0.90 kopi o,btohqsg
Oh. Nvm nvm important is we are both automotive lovers!!!!! AUTOMOTIVE BRUDDERS!!!!,btohqsg
My fav is even $0 70 only for kopi o,btohqsg
That’s why I said automotive sir.. I only have rickshaw! But one day k? I will grow up and be able to own my first car sir.,btohqsg
But not sure if I should share with you leh… sekali you drive all the way there and accidentally order more expensive coffee drink then how?? Or order coke instead of coffee??,btohqsg

Dk gst 8% they got up again anot,btohqsg
Go take a look  shell 2nd link whether got 97 or normal v power,btohqsg
vpower is literally the same as 97 with additives,btohqsg
vpower racing is the higher gradae,btohqsg
Got both 97 and vpower racing,btohqsg
My guy I was just there 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
Both my sisters ride and they pumped v power/97,btohqsg
Not really an L lah since it’s still cheap,btohqsg
Not exactly sure  they market it as better than 97 but certainly not as good as 100,btohqsg
Dono how true 100 is their 100 oso 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Sometimes we just gotta placebo effect ourselves,btohqsg
