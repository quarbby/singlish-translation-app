what am I doing with my life,btohqsg
It is just that ws there are a lot of dominant players sitting at the top (much less in ms where anyone in the top 20-30 can put off some upset),btohqsg
What about 17 y/o izaac quek that just got ticket to paris OG in tt,btohqsg
The thing is in WS  there are v dominant players on top  but she did put up commendable fight to CYF and even won ASY  so she is on the right path i guess,btohqsg

But my dad scared the missile shoot the plane,btohqsg
"""In connection with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  the Air and Space Museum is offering a sports meeting to take to the skies on Saturday 15 June. Pole vaulting will be in the spotlight. The event  designed in collaboration with the company Perfe'o  co-founded by two former Olympic athletes  and with the Dynamic Aulnay Club  will be based on the unprecedented organization of a sports competition approved by the French Athletics Federation. It was an opportunity for visitors to discover this sport as close as possible to the athletes and  for athletics fans  to treat themselves to a show before the Olympic Games.Over the course of a day  spectators will have the chance to attend a pole vault competition that could be one of the last opportunities for pole vaulters to win their ticket for the Olympics. On the program is a national mixed competition from 12:30 p.m.  international women's competition at 3 p.m. and then international men's competition. Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie has already confirmed his participation.""",btohqsg
