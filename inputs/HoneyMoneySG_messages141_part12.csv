Not to mention I am clueless about layering,btohqsg
Concept is multiple thinner layers  like 2-4 to more.For clothing  I'm skeptical to get online cuz can't try  not sure about comfort. You better ask ur friends how shop from taobao üòÅ. They may be experts.,btohqsg
It is true. I am also worried if it works or fit me. Just that I can't convince myself to spend a few hundreds for a possibly one time trip,btohqsg

Layering:22¬∞C and above: T-shirt12-21¬∞C: T-shirt + thin fleece layer / pullover / hoodie5-12¬∞C: T-shirt + thin fleece + light synthetic jacketBelow 5¬∞C: Uniqlo heat tech + T-shirt + thin fleece + light synthetic jacketNo layering:22¬∞C and above: T-shirt0-21¬∞C: T-shirt + high-fill down jacketBelow freezing: Heat tech + T-shirt + down jacketThe concept of layering is to allow you to feel more comfortable as the temperatures get colder/warmer throughout the day  or as you transition indoors/outdoors. For example if the temperature's at 15¬∞C  you might feel too cold with just a t-shirt  but also too warm with a high-fill down jacket.,btohqsg

You have to check the iPhone warranty from that country bought does it state international warranty. Also  there may be certain internal components that are country specific so the Apple Store may not have that specific part to cover for it. Important is you must have the purchase receipt.,btohqsg
