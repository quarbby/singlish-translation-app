Learning in rp is basically studying in a school where information is given and can be used at any time but...all you need to know is how to use it,btohqsg

A Open book test/exam will never be easier than a Closed book test/exam,btohqsg

even seniors in rp have said some of the exams that are open book usually give questions that are not in the notes,btohqsg
there is always a give or take lmao...you want to graduate 1 yr earlier,btohqsg

on the bright side at least failing jc..you can still go to the other 4 polys...failing those poly's you can still come rp,btohqsg

no  I am not hating the teacher I need to do well thank you very much,btohqsg
bruh i did not mean it that way,btohqsg
because alot of the teachers are part timers,btohqsg
so they dont give two shit about the results...as a class  you can call for the module chair to relook at results,btohqsg
u should be thinking.. since when pocoyo is intellect,btohqsg
if the class feels like the teacher marked wrongly or the class has scored suspiciously low,btohqsg
so in this sense...you kinda fuck over the teacher,btohqsg
cause essentially you are saying the teacher is not serious,btohqsg
