One charge up North (or down South)? Not quite  but with a bit of planning  Audi's e-tron family shows that's not too big of an issueTake a sneak peek into our first post-pandemic road trip to KL with the Audi e-trons!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if the Audi e-tron is your preferred choice of electric vehicles!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Its fun that Audi e-tron and Poorsche Taycan is essentially the same platform,btohqsg
Think he wasn't really going fast,btohqsg
Just video driving a legendary car doesn't make him irresponsible,btohqsg
VW Porsche Audi Skoda Seat all share platform and certain parts... interchangeable...,btohqsg
Check out the brembo and rotors,btohqsg
I think he will sure win everyone on the 100-0,btohqsg
Pretty much how EVs will work in the future. Companies will develop one platform and the body  suspension and interior will be all that's different and power limits basis pricing. It'll be more of a coach building method over completely new development with a few key players who will develop platforms like Tesla  Rimac  Rivian  VAG and others,btohqsg
Certain models don’t .. so must do the homework and even if so  there is frequently some badging tax to be paid 😁😁,btohqsg
Rivian is already using their skateboard platform for the pickup truck and SUV,btohqsg
Yup  I noticed! Are the rims BBS?,btohqsg
Yes I talk with ppl like such before   they said can’t win You in acceleration   but can try to win you in braking distance,btohqsg
