That is correct. You can go YouTube to see videos to learn what cards can fill in the gaps. Ex: UOB Lady with category travel chosen. Spend time to go through so you can make a good choice to maximize your spending.,btohqsg
HSBC premier maybe enforcing $200k aum rule. May affect musical chairs accounts.,btohqsg
To get around this it might be a case you need to maintain $400k every alternate month to avoid being downgraded / penalty fee?,btohqsg
When revenue ticket more expensive than what I can get using miles,btohqsg
any extra fees on endowus if i setup dca weekly vs monthly?,btohqsg
Revenue Y: $1800Redemption Y: cost of miles maybe $900 + tax $100 total cost $1000Since itâ€™s advantage can go for a short trip to Bali or BKK ðŸ˜›If u can buy miles at 1cpm,btohqsg
This could be due to last minute booking price already up. Then camouflaged high y redemption cents per mile achieved,btohqsg
Yes yes!  If really wanna travel lo,btohqsg
Bank will charge fees for CPF-IS transactions.Endowus won't charge additional fees.,btohqsg
is the DCS Flex card better for foreign spend as compared to youtrip/trust?technically since the 8% cashback can cover some of the 3.25% fx currency fee,btohqsg
Yeah Iâ€™m not saying donâ€™t do it. But donâ€™t bluff yourself you got a good deal.Be aware you got a lousy redemption valuation but it saved you from paying high cash prices,btohqsg
No lah. Itâ€™s not a good deal. But if u really need to travel  using miles might be cheaper than paying cash.,btohqsg
Almost all the credit cards we discuss here win YouTrip,btohqsg
Cpm is cost per dollar?Means if citireward 4 miles per dollar how to convert to cpm?,btohqsg

hi gurus  for the singsaver citibank card cash reward for spending $500. Does CRMC + amaze count?,btohqsg
$400k / 2 months= $200 000 average per month balance,btohqsg
Depends on how frequently they look at AUM. If monthly then impose fee  then can't.Prob got to see if overall worth to even be premier.,btohqsg
Yeah all in theory only. Also whatâ€™s in tnc may not be whatâ€™s really practiced.Just throwing out possibilities.It wonâ€™t make sense to maintain $200k every month since you will Lugi the 1% incremental interest.Stupid mechanics,btohqsg
Best to check t&c to be sure,btohqsg

I'm exploring at changing my uob one credit card to other better cash back cards. However  this will affect the interest rate I'm receiving for my uob one account. I place a premium on convenience and not having to track spending by having only one primary credit card. Anybody has any advice in whether I should replace my uob 1 card?,btohqsg
Why dont u calculate the interest u would receive with uob one acc and uob cashback vs new cc cashback %,btohqsg
This is the most backward service by HSBC. The moment you own 1 of their product  your next bank account sign up must go down physically. Iâ€™m so annoyed,btohqsg
Spend the minimal 500 on uob1 cc then. Anything else you can use better cashback cards like DCS,btohqsg
If i not wrong  you still need to go down to the bank to register your signature if you plan to earn the ega giro 1% cb.,btohqsg
Just google oem u input the info and rate for each company will show liao. Cc rebate really based on the promo with each company. So u have to do your own research,btohqsg
Cannot waive. Just pay and get miles for renewal.,btohqsg
Hi just need a quick input  how to check if UOB new sign up points bonus still available. It shows for first 100 only .,btohqsg
