Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner‚Äôs pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don‚Äôt expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg

I'm on Instagram as@asashootshimself. Install the app to follow my photos and videos.https://www.instagram.com/invites/contact/?igsh=1p816dhwdqb05&utm_content=w1b2sjg,btohqsg
At this point I just created a new account,btohqsg
errm? bro that‚Äôs a very bad idea in the first place. there are other plastics capable of doing so?,btohqsg
i dun think u understood the qn but thanks for the answer üôèüèª,btohqsg
Okay as a start I recall in the early lancer forums someone made this,btohqsg
Basically it‚Äôs closed cell foam. Tahan +116 degrees,btohqsg
In theory  most closed cell foams should work la. Even rock wool. But I prefer the foams,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt recommend 3d printing it  esp pla cos it‚Äôs biodegradable and it WILL degrade in your car. Turns into a gummy mess. ABS  maybe but likely will deform into spaghetti and eaten up by your turbo. Other ways u can try is thin aluminium sheeting? But those are a bitch to cut.,btohqsg
Aluminium sheeting increases heat and reduces performance,btohqsg
i‚Äôm finding a way to drop the air temp around the intake. if not i‚Äôll proceed with a short ram,btohqsg
why would anyone try to use PLA ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Just think about the average intelligence of the average person in singapore,btohqsg
And realise that‚Ä¶ half of our population is below that,btohqsg
just look at how the average singaporean takes care of their cars,btohqsg
"""huh i thought tyre can last forever one""",btohqsg
using an older  stiffer + slick tire is saving fuel & grips the road better,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like F1 hard tyres üëçüèº,btohqsg
‚Äúif my tire don‚Äôt have much friction on the road  means i roll easier = save fuel‚Äù,btohqsg
a slick way to meet god,btohqsg
Shield wise is just aluminum sheet and reflective heat tape,btohqsg
cos nvan  tried put a cone filter on it..endup intake temp higher..stock is the way to go,btohqsg
there are good 3dprint materials with quite high heat tolerance but even still...the heat tape needs to be there..just that once u use high heat tolerant materials means harder to print  so ur 3dprinter at home might not tahan/not every place can anyhow print,btohqsg
as for what ive heard from my dad's friend is that he use 3dprint plastic can only last 1 week then dies fast,btohqsg
he said that he getting someone 3dprint in CF,btohqsg
just use 3dprint random plastic to mockup then cf printhttps://chemtron.com.sg/materials/continuous-fiber/3d-material-carbon-fiber,btohqsg
Saw this car at vivo city carpark yesterday,btohqsg
That should be the Ferrari roma right,btohqsg
Yeah I think if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
Lol. Home 3d printers can get up to 300¬∞c. U should look into PETG filament. It melts at 260¬∞c. PLA is abt 180¬∞c and engine gets to about 220¬∞c so u defo melt. Is not ur printer cannot tahan  is just wrong filament.,btohqsg
for most cars fine but uh,btohqsg
my dad's friend..obv keicar small engine bay so heat radiates like mad... already upgraded alot of cooling parts but still need more cooling...so that's why he felt that his 3dprint shroud not adequate enuf esp since hes making more power which is why he needs supporting mods(stock nvan slow asf.. horrible throttle response too),btohqsg
Just cut holes in bonnet. Ez,btohqsg
Put a scoop on that Nvan,btohqsg
I mean im new to this group chat,btohqsg
Hi new to this group chat,btohqsg
nah he say he dont like aesthetic,btohqsg
but he already upgraded intercooler and stuff,btohqsg
he had carbon hood but sold tho,btohqsg
eh wait mb its still on his car,btohqsg
