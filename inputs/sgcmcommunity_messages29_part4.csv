For cars more mass market like a 3 series or model 3,btohqsg
Can choose online or go to the Tesla store you see the small wall and you're done,btohqsg
No build updates  changing spec  delivery experience as such,btohqsg
But many buy the car for the whole experience which D2C can't offer,btohqsg
True also but some enjoy la haha   like no ppl pester u for Loan or insurance,btohqsg
Jaguar unveils restored E-type at Jubilee celebrationsTruly a stunning classic carüòçüëâüèª React with üòç if you agree the Jaguar E-type Roadster is indeed stunning!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
"And many buy the car for the experience that D2C offers  which traditional route doesn't.It's a paradigm shift.In the past  people will go to stores to look at physical objects  bargain with sales staff.. try to get freebies.. feel good about the whole experience.  The sales guy gave out ""freebies"" which are in fact paid by the buyer anyway.. so sales guy is also happy.We all know it's an illusion LOLThese middle man fees ""built into product prices and ""freebies"""" help to pay for his salary  rental for the premises  a cosy area for the customers  annual gifts/cards etc etcEven with S$10k rebate  S$20k discount.. there is still NETT profits for them. It has to be.  They are not a charity. They are a business.However  with B2C... the middle layer is cut away.Buyer buys the same part/product.. but without the need to haggle or pay for middle man fees.Sure  some still require the illusion of ""control"".But the tide is changing. Others prefer a straightforward sale without having to pay middle man fees.I believe more manufactuers will start selling direct.",btohqsg
I agree with you! All I'm saying is that many manufacturers will have to make further vertical divisions in their brand to segment the D2C section from the dealership model,btohqsg
Nod. I agree with you too!,btohqsg
and who knows.. another 5 decades.. and it will shift back to dealerships etc...,btohqsg
without middleman. Benz will be very cheap in Sg... will lose the atas feel,btohqsg
That's why some people like pain. LOL.How much is this Benz? S$150k?No.. i don't want.. i want to pay S$300k for it...Oh look.. my foot.. shoot it!Seriously? LOL,btohqsg
I recall PI sells same model cheaper (for merc),btohqsg
Even if it becomes cheaper  will still have that feel I would say,btohqsg
Because if you look at other markets and don't add in the dealer mark-ups of the current market but look at a pre covid market. Many Japanese and German brands had entry level cars priced around the same range,btohqsg
But people still run after the badge,btohqsg
I agree :)because quality will always be there...,btohqsg
I remember I check out the price of e200 in 2019... CNC got $7xk  profit from selling one e200,btohqsg
because there is quality (at least in the past) associated with the badge,btohqsg
Because there's more attached to the brand than just the price of it. For example  Ferrari has the racing heritage  although they might not have been that good for the past two years  but the heritage carries on,btohqsg
wow... i wouldn't be surprise...So would someone prefer this to B2C? really?,btohqsg
It's an image that's been built over the years,btohqsg
"It's the insecure who are after ""expensive"" stuff....The secure and those who know what they want... will look for other intangibles or useful tangibles .. rather than price.. .they look for Value.",btohqsg
$7x k can buy a honda jazz then readyüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
And that's why brands offer models to target every type of person,btohqsg
From a c160 that's a worse spec than a regular Corolla Altis to a c63,btohqsg
LOL.. can't believe they have a C160... LOL,btohqsg
But there's some on the roads,btohqsg
Really don't understand why they exist,btohqsg
someone must have woken up and decided ... enough is enough LOL,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ more like c&c upselling people to ready stock c180s while downselling e class buyers to c180s as well,btohqsg
That's what they love selling  c180s and GLBs,btohqsg
IMHO  C180... 1.8T I can understand.. but any lower capacity than 1.8T.. then the car shouldn't be driven.. may be parked... but not driven LOL,btohqsg
Gone are the days where 180 meant a 1.8T,btohqsg
no way... OMG... my heart.. .my heart....,btohqsg
this is the e200 premium noe. about $$80k now over cost price,btohqsg
There was a time when.. there is no replacement for displacement...,btohqsg
The new generation that was just launched and the previous one as well,btohqsg
OMG.... cheers to those who love this sales model.. rather than a B2C model :) Cheers to you all :),btohqsg
80k over cost price.. then someone goes and bargain.. get free car perfume and dash cam... feels reallllll good LOL,btohqsg
And 20 to 30k over their car's paper+body value,btohqsg
That explain why e class depreciation is so scary,btohqsg
But e class is nothing compare to i4,btohqsg
My wife says it is not about the size it is about how u use it. I‚Äôm not sure if she is just consoling me though,btohqsg
Don't let go.... Don't let go...,btohqsg
ok but gotta say mercedes smart,btohqsg
they taking adv of those who want the brand,btohqsg
is like bmw making a 516i or smt hahaha,btohqsg
but i don‚Äôt understand why ppl want buy e180 brand newfor that price can buy used e250,btohqsg
like I said ... the 3 point star brand is more expensive than the car itself.,btohqsg
