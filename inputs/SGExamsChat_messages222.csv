I mean u end up taking the As regardless where u go,btohqsg
will scoring a better l1r5 make u do better for a lvls?,btohqsg
"U may get into a ""better"" JC",btohqsg
Which may help u do better in As,btohqsg
i can give all students in the worst JC resources/teachers from the best JC and they can still do way lower than national average,btohqsg
if u want me to be strict,btohqsg
"I always tell my bro This ""all sch is a good sch""",btohqsg
In the end still a sch and y'all sit for same paper,btohqsg
Did u mean to take pure sci in jc or,btohqsg
When inside u know its not true,btohqsg
ok this sounds a bit extreme,btohqsg
my point is  its your attitude that matters,btohqsg
Nope  you will pick up again in jc just stay focused thru out the 1.5 years,btohqsg
My principal told me that when I was sec 1,btohqsg
even in my sch itself there are ups teachers but theres only so much they can do,btohqsg
Maybe it's a phrase all principals use,btohqsg
And I diedie wan go jc,btohqsg
Yeah so having to retake makes it even more difficult to take up extra commitments!,btohqsg
Unless u mean the research kind,btohqsg
Well based on my results now,btohqsg
@chemcerif u want H3  all jcs offer it,btohqsg
If it leads u to where u want faster?,btohqsg
Didn't get the score I wanted,btohqsg
Are u IB? I thot u Os,btohqsg
those niche ones then maybe some jcs dont have,btohqsg
And h3 selection is based on ur yesr 1 grades,btohqsg
I share acc w my broAron,btohqsg
Relative to the cohort (i think),btohqsg
siao on has limits also ah,btohqsg
Is H3 a must? It seems so tiring thou,btohqsg
u gonna fight with chem ppl from chem RA,btohqsg
and their chem is quite godly alr,btohqsg
the reason they are so godly is cos,btohqsg
they do extra reading on their own,btohqsg
my friend managed it coming from non chem ra background i think but he srsly trade away his life,btohqsg
Not sure if u want to follow la,btohqsg
they straight up pon almost half the lessons for everyth else,btohqsg
i nvr see my friend for like 2 terms in a row cuz he mugging chem like siao,btohqsg
but if they can cope in all other subjects its fine also,btohqsg
95% of jc ppl dont even take a h3?,btohqsg
Just go look in the mirror ask urself 1 qn,btohqsg
Unless u confident of getting all A,btohqsg
If udw then don't bother unless for fun,btohqsg
i mean now seeing o lvl results gives u a rough impression of the cohort's standard le,btohqsg
I went through j1 like that,btohqsg
like the subject grades u get for o lvl right,btohqsg
as long as its between A1-B3  u have a fair chance of getting A for that subject at A lvls (esp for A1/A2),btohqsg
with the right attitude  knowledge is easily acquired,btohqsg
b3 is more unlikely  but still possible.,btohqsg
J1 is for u to fk around have fun,btohqsg
I messed up the order of things,btohqsg
but i brought that up cos of something that happened recently last yr before a lvls,btohqsg
some dude kept failing chem and i asked him  how do u revise,btohqsg
''oh i do prelim papers from top schools...'',btohqsg
j2 after birthday can go clubbing lo,btohqsg
work on easier/more manageable sch papers first,btohqsg
in the end a lvls i believe he got rekted,btohqsg
he siao on in the wrong way,btohqsg
so sometimes being too onz can backfire wrongly,btohqsg
I halved my rp from j1 to j2 then when I start studying again I started w h1 content,btohqsg
and if u not doing well shld at least try a diff way/approach,btohqsg
Too onz means too stressed unless u enjoy it anyway,btohqsg
Then if u keep on doing stuff u completely cannot do,btohqsg
And don't learn a lot too,btohqsg
so when he said this yr a lvl chem prac was very hard,btohqsg
i straight up told him  easier than last yr,btohqsg
or rather  manageable at the very least,btohqsg
Anyone here from Analytics and AI course or similar courses in poly?,btohqsg
A lvls no need to worry abt this,btohqsg
70 and 90 give same grade,btohqsg
aim so high like just stress only,btohqsg
I used to think that way in j1 and that was just stress,btohqsg
Its like getting a high grade got no purpose,btohqsg
Unless u want flex but thats kinda toxic,btohqsg
j1 can party a bit  but j2 must serious,btohqsg
Id say j2 don't need to die die be srs,btohqsg
But going into j2 u shld have a good idea of whats the best way for u to tackle acads/a levels,btohqsg
So for me I kinda knew what to do from overstretching in j1 then j2 could relax a bit,btohqsg
Lol my parents wants my bro,btohqsg
The problem is ppl very unsure then they keep on anyhow slashing and changing how they approach things,btohqsg
ye man  but <15 good le,btohqsg
if im in ur bro's position i either do that  or appeal to a JC/CI. Ideally the latter,btohqsg
oh gosh sec 4 -> year 5,btohqsg
same la. That time i see my l1r5 i also wtf,btohqsg
Wait so he needs to take private ah,btohqsg
but JC/CI works also if appeal goes thru,btohqsg
i know for CI very very high chance get in with appeal,btohqsg
He 15 points but he cannot go the course he w,btohqsg
But do y'all think isit good for my bro to go private,btohqsg
But he n level-) o level q a good improvement,btohqsg
But I just vvv scared for him if he go poly / ci,btohqsg
Like he needs way longer time to study then normal ppl,btohqsg
did u make it into other jc,btohqsg
anyways i was certain i wanted a level route,btohqsg
do they rly teach slower than jc?,btohqsg
n yall hv pw in 2nd year right,btohqsg
ye cos i was thinking MI > YIJC if my l1r5 higher,btohqsg
didnt u get ur o’s results alr,btohqsg
they were asking if the syllabus in mi is slower,btohqsg
i cld make it to a good poly course,btohqsg
More like the course i want most la,btohqsg
meh i don't necessarily think it'sslower  it's just more spread out,btohqsg
the pace is still the same,btohqsg
Actl i alw wanted social work but i alr decides to take it as postgrad diploma so,btohqsg
and y1 isn't a honeymoon year,btohqsg
Can la but id rather get a uni degree related to my poly diploma,btohqsg
then which uni degree u want?,btohqsg
probably not big 3 I think,btohqsg
y'all thinking too far  take it ez,btohqsg
don't recall big 3 having anything related to tourism,btohqsg
idk tbh but when I applied don't have alr,btohqsg
Singapore not promoting tourism as much liao,btohqsg
my friends volunteers as a museum guide kek,btohqsg
or if i gd enough im gna go to psych,btohqsg
bc i cmi to psych in poly,btohqsg
hii  can I check if my eng and hcl get the same grade wld they use eng or hcl for L1r5?,btohqsg
I think they get the betttr oneIf same then wont matter which one they choose,btohqsg
cos if they use hcl for L1 then I can’t use it to minus another 2 from my l1r5 :/,btohqsg
Prolly they go for ur best score,btohqsg
Eii this one must ask my friend alr,btohqsg
No la  they only use HCL if its better than your english,btohqsg
if same  then your english is used and you get the bonus points,btohqsg
if not how do people get into RI HAHA,btohqsg
Go and rep nation after that dae inside ig?,btohqsg
As in it got more pops recently,btohqsg
Is it? Tot it has always been . Partly also cos they accept larger cohort size,btohqsg
got so many major inside one course  ofc popular la,btohqsg
The RP went up by quite a bit last year tho,btohqsg
Probably gonna maintain cut off this year too,btohqsg
English  then your HCl can be used for 2 bonus points. Another case: EL A2  HCl A1. Its still a better score to use EL as a grade and get 2 bonus points from HCl  so that's how its computed.,btohqsg
Pass EL and Higher Mother tongue = 2 bonus points. Of course  for your L1R5  you would use the one with the better grade.,btohqsg
im pretty decided but i felt like asking for advice,btohqsg
i got 26 raw and nett for os (l1r4) so shld i go to poly or ite,btohqsg
if you can go into a course that you think you can remotely tahan  then poly  otherwise go to a course that you're interested in in ITE,btohqsg
i'm interested in sports sci and/or hospitality,btohqsg
damn 1 point more and my life wld be easier,btohqsg
so i think you should defo at least put some poly courses as your first choice,btohqsg
school of sports aso got a couple of courses,btohqsg
Guys home schooled student got diff cut off than sch students meh?,btohqsg
but isnt sports science like 15,btohqsg
yeah i hv mixed feelings abt these,btohqsg
just asking   isit very risky if i put all choices which the cop i meet borderline?,btohqsg
then like first few the cop lower by 1 or 2,btohqsg
Can someone give me some advice. Shld i go to njc or nyjc? I live in bukit panjang so njc is nearer to my house. However i heard nyjc is really good (3rd in sg i think) but its like an hour journey from my house. I am really confused on which one i shld i put as my 1st choice.,btohqsg
Which school's culture do you prefer? And consider the subjects and ccas offered in both jcs,btohqsg
put a couple that you know u confirm can make it in as a safety net,btohqsg
You could spend more time doing stuff with less travel time,btohqsg
I dun really care about culture i guess. I am intending to take 4H2 Phy  Computing  Math  Econs.,btohqsg
And u can wake up earlier  sleep later,btohqsg
for myself i think travel time isn't as much of a concern bah. a lot if ppl in my school travel the country to get to MI and still do decently well,btohqsg
i think u can consider if you can ‘tolerate’ the travelling time for the 2 years you’re gonna study there,btohqsg
I have alr been travelling long dist for sec sch and its been tiring. So i guess i would prefer to cut down travelling time.,btohqsg
Is like the quality between njc and nyjc around the same?,btohqsg
Both are nerdy schsNyjc is a v hardworking. Is that the culture that u would like,btohqsg
Hmm i would like to slack sometimes as well,btohqsg
Nyjc is rather stressfulPushes the students hard,btohqsg
But if studies is ur priority would be good,btohqsg
Thanks for the input i think i'll put njc as my first choice,btohqsg
No. Njc is 3rd. Nyjc is far behind,btohqsg
Yes njc is the 3rd best jc in sg after rjc n hci,btohqsg
No eh nyjc is 6 pts njc is 7 pts,btohqsg
P sure its the other way around,btohqsg
Once upon a time  a few centuries ago  maybe,btohqsg
Kumar feels happy for a sec,btohqsg
Anyway erhm! Think of the reduced travel time as adding an extra hour-1.5 to your day and then seeing whether its worth it to you,btohqsg
I thought about it  but I heard the facilities very old,btohqsg
Im ranking in terms of a lvl results  not cop,btohqsg
Omg why have evthg changed so much,btohqsg
Like stock market like that not stable,btohqsg
Then go nyjc since nyjc is above njc now n nyjc is very new,btohqsg
if distance then njc better tbh,btohqsg
"the difference in quality not big enough that u can just look at it in terms of ""who get higher a level avg"" imo",btohqsg
Try to see the programmes each sch offers and which sch more inline w ur interests?,btohqsg
actually is more or less similar across all JCs,btohqsg
NJC has a niche in research,btohqsg
then think abt how much u value the extra 1.5h bah,btohqsg
I abit out of the loop alr,btohqsg
NYJC has a niche in flexible combinations,btohqsg
depends on what you why you want to learn sports sci,btohqsg
Each JC has niches  which can tilt your decision one way or another,btohqsg
if u want enter sports industry,btohqsg
Oh my u need to get updated,btohqsg
in terms of heritage and culture I'd say yes,btohqsg
How does one even rank that...,btohqsg
Hii everyone   unfortunately I know some people didn’t do “well” should u did badly and require advice on DAE do message me. 🙂,btohqsg
if you could go back to when you were sec 4  what would you have chosen,btohqsg
Definitely study harder n go to a top jc lah,btohqsg
Ya that's what most would think of,btohqsg
only can choose to go different place with the score u had,btohqsg
ya so what would u have chosen,btohqsg
I would have applied for acjc instead,btohqsg
Sorry i am out of touch,btohqsg
does sch ranking matter that much,btohqsg
I give u top notch sch,btohqsg
Feel free to disagree but i think most impt is ur own attitude,btohqsg
Results-wise  ranking is the least important thing,btohqsg
tbh i think attitude most impt,btohqsg
have anyone managed to revoke their eae after deadlines before?,btohqsg
but ofc school ranking matters also to some extent,btohqsg
Put a future 90 pointer in any JC and they will still get 90,btohqsg
I mean disregarding brand name schools (e.g. raffles where connections are real)  for the rest  ranking matter meh?,btohqsg
all tertiary institutions have produced 90 rpers before,btohqsg
Dont blame swimming trunks too big,btohqsg
Schools differ in what they are able to offer outside the curriculum,btohqsg
7 for prelims 15 for Os lol,btohqsg
Why u nvr say hi back :(,btohqsg
To me yes 😂 every sch is same just that different name sounds different,btohqsg
I did worse for A levels than in j1 hahaha,btohqsg
and the name is important to you?,btohqsg
Its still lies on the complex plane,btohqsg
Name-wise  ACJC has the best name  because the C repeats  which sounds nice  and A rhymes with J,btohqsg
More like if can choose then choose wad we like loJust like handbag. Any bag can serve its function but if i can choose then take advantage of the choosing power,btohqsg
Do well just drop your eae and take dae,btohqsg
But somehow acjc sounds better 😂,btohqsg
Hwa chong and ri of cos is the best  followed by njc (last time),btohqsg
bro its a clear yes LOL,btohqsg
even oxford once published a news report online,btohqsg
"What do u mean ""sell urself""?",btohqsg
Yes good also but i dun like the jc,btohqsg
that seeing the institution ''RI'' makes them more interested in the applicant,btohqsg
if you were from RI  would you wear raffles shirts outside and let everyone know u were from RI?,btohqsg
Have to waste 1 year tho,btohqsg
If have then use that branding lo,btohqsg
what happens if the said applicant failed A levels,btohqsg
Dont people wear their school shirt most of the time?,btohqsg
The universe would tear apart if that happens,btohqsg
there r ppl from ri who fail As,btohqsg
and many more who get below 60rp,btohqsg
What do u mean by failing As,btohqsg
Selling yourself simply means accentuating the good points and keeping quiet about the less good points 😆,btohqsg
It simply means person is talented but sth screwed up,btohqsg
I see  hopefully all employers think that way,btohqsg
why not  it happens every yr,btohqsg
just that u dont hear of them,btohqsg
I think so. Even i passed 😂 how can anyone fail hahahha,btohqsg
u know in ri there are ppl who retain for 2 yrs also right,btohqsg
once in y5 and once in y6,btohqsg
from my batch alr got 2 I think,btohqsg
Nope. Employment is dfferent. Schools talk about applying for scholarship etc ma,btohqsg
Who r they? What name n what batch,btohqsg
one was my bmt section mate,btohqsg
so went back ri as j3 after bmt,btohqsg
its mentioned on the ri press page (or a affiliated page) and 1 of my ex sch teachers from RI (forgot his name),btohqsg
doubt u will be able to anyway,btohqsg
i rather spend my time doing more productive stuff,btohqsg
RI doesn't mean u r good at academics  anyway,btohqsg
RI takes in plenty of DSAs,btohqsg
Yee  I knew someone who got in there and then retained twice because they didn't study,btohqsg
hi sorryy but does anyone know any cheap/affordable but good laptops for school?? pls help😭,btohqsg
my friend brought second hand laptop and it worked fine for hom,btohqsg
below $500 as low as possible???,btohqsg
Really hard to work with unless youre fine with 2nd hand,btohqsg
if JC rite  you're better off buying an iPad,btohqsg
Wouldnt a laptop be btr for pw tho,btohqsg
I think an iPad is more functional than a $500 laptop,btohqsg
even then  $500 is super tight,btohqsg
True but i find it easier to type on a laptop than an ipad,btohqsg
From what ive seen from my friend,btohqsg
A $500 laptop won't last u very long ether,btohqsg
In most jcs i think you can borrow laptops,btohqsg
if u don't need to use a lot of applications,btohqsg
and just need it for like documents and stuff,btohqsg
u can look at a chromebook,btohqsg
i can print stuff from chromebook right like i connect to printer?,btohqsg
my sister use ipad for her university pw she say its much easier than laptop,btohqsg
i like the science behind it ig,btohqsg
i took bio in sec sch and respiration was interesting to me so i felt id like sports sci?,btohqsg
i wld consider outdoor adv learning (is that a course lol?) but im not very fit,btohqsg
i dropped in s3 alr lol,btohqsg
or did you mistake me for someone else,btohqsg
Hmm or you said it’s your best subject,btohqsg
A1 🥺 im still in denial but its ok,btohqsg
Ppl who didnt do 3/4 of the paper also passed so the amath bellcurve was rly gd,btohqsg
But id rather hv balanced grades,btohqsg
Somehow I don’t feel that happy anymore,btohqsg
Distinction def not easy to get,btohqsg
Hmm I had a student failed English,btohqsg
Wait is it eae then kena revoke,btohqsg
whats the diff between raw score and net score,btohqsg
nett takes into acc bonus points which can be attained from more than one and max 2 of these: cca performance (if good  -1  excellent -2)  higher mt D7 and up (-2)  third lang pass(?) (-2) (pls correct me if im wrong @ everyone else),btohqsg
to be eligible for jc u nd 20 pts RAW before deduction of points,btohqsg
but once ur eligible for jc they dont care abt ur raw score  they only look at ur nett,btohqsg
One is with cap the other isnt,btohqsg
Speaking of laptops  are laptops or iPads compulsory to have/bring in most JCs?,btohqsg
but would be convenient for PW,btohqsg
Some subjects are laptop subjects  where it’s a lot more convenient to make notes with laptop,btohqsg
But not exactly compulsory of course,btohqsg
most jcs would loan out laptops for you to use for PW,btohqsg
if you dont mind bringing your own laptop to sch  it is more convenient to use your own laptop for pw,btohqsg
yes  its now pretty much compulsory,btohqsg
but dont have to bring to jc unless its for pw,btohqsg
Does anyone know anyone from privAte dip going to loCal Uni?,btohqsg
so is a laptop really compulsory? or just a computer is fine? for JC,btohqsg
its a genuine question  I really don't know need or not mao,btohqsg
I think it's not compulsory but it's very good to have one,btohqsg
if you ever need to use a computer in school  can borrow from them,btohqsg
Cos sometimes you have to do work in school,btohqsg
Rip I have never done that before,btohqsg
or just tompang from your groupmate LOL,btohqsg
that's what I was thinking HAHAHA,btohqsg
sharing with them is always an option,btohqsg
private diploma goes to private degree,btohqsg
it doesn't make sense for private diploma to go to local uni,btohqsg
Do u think is it worth for him to go,btohqsg
Cuz his grades can go poly,btohqsg
And going to poly alr gonna be tough,btohqsg
but is his English actl bad?,btohqsg
or is just some anomaly result?,btohqsg
Cuz like some even get e8/f9-,btohqsg
I mean he has like q alot of choices on form A,btohqsg
then I suggest retake O levels and apply to jc next year,btohqsg
He nid go ns Liao lor,btohqsg
if he wants to get into a public university  best to go either jc or poly,btohqsg
idk if 22 can go jc though,btohqsg
what's his path before priv Os?,btohqsg
if he planning to go poly or jc  can defer,btohqsg
20 years old still can defer,btohqsg
can defer up to diploma/ a level,btohqsg
ya better to defer if can,btohqsg
Then just go to NS then do A levels as a private candidate,btohqsg
damn tough sia  some more he want go comp sci  the rp requirement is high,btohqsg
Laii u donate me ur notes I give my bro,btohqsg
My bro cannot even understand IB notes,btohqsg
"What happened to ""Anything is possible""",btohqsg
I am pretty sure IB tougher than As...,btohqsg
at least u must get to that level of aptitude,btohqsg
I tot attitude to study towards smth,btohqsg
some ppl prefer ib style some ppl prefer a level style,btohqsg
a level q hard to diy ah  especially if he diy o lvl also,btohqsg
I mean he is q strong in his math,btohqsg
can is can lah  but really takes a god level kind of mugger to pull it off,btohqsg
That's why myb private is btr?,btohqsg
I think the problem now is that he needs to retake o lvl english but he also needs to enlist,btohqsg
you say your can go into JC?,btohqsg
I mean his form A has like,btohqsg
he just needs to gain acceptance into poly/JC,btohqsg
Goal 1:Study comp sci in local unipath 1a: enlist  retake o lvl english while in NS  apply JAE in 2022  go JCpath 1b: go poly  apply to uni,btohqsg
he needs to retake english Os first,btohqsg
no  MI and YIJC take in everyone who qualifies for JC,btohqsg
if you hit 20 or below L1R5,btohqsg
if he gains entry into jc,btohqsg
But JC allow 24 year old person meh,btohqsg
What subjects he want to take,btohqsg
No one doing w him he won't feel motivated,btohqsg
i tell you alr. Can defer one,btohqsg
dont need to think so much HAHA,btohqsg
He wanted go mi for accounting,btohqsg
defer and go to YIJC or polytechnic,btohqsg
I traveled to poly for 2 yeara,btohqsg
sec sch and jc for 6 years  1h each way,btohqsg
Ltr I go see what he put,btohqsg
doesn't matter if u have no choice,btohqsg
I will be damn paranoid if he get lost or smth,btohqsg
Cuz he can't even take 4 LRT STOPS HOME,btohqsg
He don't even know what is east or west loop,btohqsg
He don't even have a phone,btohqsg
Those who are vvvvvv damn hyper,btohqsg
Who can't even sit down for 5mins?,btohqsg
Those kind are my brother's breed,btohqsg
Hais istg I always blame myself for being a bad sis,btohqsg
Anyone knows where I can get the English oral topics for private candidates last year?,btohqsg

Hey guys i lost my airpods pro in sp fc4  where can i go to ask about it?,btohqsg
Is there a lost and found or something,btohqsg

Where do u think u lost it?,btohqsg
Or wad places have u stopped by before,btohqsg
wah but can do private Os and do well  respect,btohqsg
Singapore poly  food court 4  is there a lost and found in school?,btohqsg
and also maybe write an email or create a notice to sp food court 4 lor,btohqsg
Recommended actions  in order:1. Ask the cleaner if they found it. Ask at the drinks stall (typically is the key tenant).2. Ask at the General Admin office about: lost and found. There's likely some system in place.If a honest person found the item  the above are the likely ways you'll be reconnected with your airpods.,btohqsg
he was alone in the room w a teacher,btohqsg
Having him to write essay takes 2hds,btohqsg

Omg wahhh how do u do that,btohqsg
