How I know for guys here who put money in Ocbc 360 account which credit card you guys spend on. Nothing seems to be good for miles,btohqsg
Last time is titanium rewards... but now i duno liao cos i nv use 360 acct,btohqsg
OCBC rewards (titanium rewards) still quite decent.,btohqsg
UOB ONE acct is still by far the best... easy to hit interest target,btohqsg
I mean for the spending is it nett of the qtr Cashback or the bank look at gross spending?,btohqsg
Let me guess what@MelvynEzigonna say... what does the tnc says?,btohqsg
What do you mean? The tnc states pretty clearly. Consecutive spend of 500/1000/2000every month in the quarter.,btohqsg
Any uob promo for new cc application?,btohqsg

Hi anyone has any idea if its easy to get a waiver for the uob prvimiles card?,btohqsg
Online shopping (Amazon  Lazada  Uniqlo)  Vouchers from Heymax. Now can spend at Unity and Watsons too.,btohqsg

Most uob entry level cards are easy to waive with spend activity,btohqsg
Is Krispay excluded from uob card sign up promo?,btohqsg
I see. Alright appreciate the reply 🙏🏽,btohqsg
Applied stash account. Given oub debit card. After that applied UOB one account. If spend debit card issued by stash account. Will able to clock the 500 spending on UOB one account bonus?,btohqsg
Or all card from stash account also consider for uob one account,btohqsg
I see zero on my card,btohqsg
But one challenge for stash account is keeping tracking the MAB. If it falls below for next month  you lose the bonus interest. My tot is use stash account for holding purpose  if got good promotions like FD with better rates  withdraw lump sum so you only lose for month and then put back one lump sum. That is my tots,btohqsg
Hi any expert can advice usually how long withdraw funds from moo moo to local bank,btohqsg
From your cash withdrawable? Or still in the funds haven’t redeem yet,btohqsg
When you redeem funds they already stated clearly when will you be able to withdraw them,btohqsg
Can i check currently  which is the best saving accounts?,btohqsg
Maybe you can watch this video by Chris:https://youtu.be/1ScSGvBkAq4,btohqsg
Hi can I check if I use my UOB one debit card to pay off my citibank credit card  does it count as the $500 spent?,btohqsg
Can i check for the $500  what would you guys typically spend on?,btohqsg
Daily necessities? Food? Transport? Groceries? Subscriptions? Telco bills? Online shopping?,btohqsg
I wish to reach a day when someone tells me to spend $500 and I can't think of what I'd want to spend it on 😁,btohqsg
My CPF Portfolio Update & Investment Strategy for 2024https://youtu.be/1wkXOt-e5HU,btohqsg
I would always say give me,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check for ocbc 360  if my salary credit is on like 25th every month  will I still be entitled for the save bonus if I don’t add the extra 500 on the 1st? Will they add up my balance from 1st to 24th then the new balance from 25th to 31st and divide to get the adb of 500?,btohqsg
Assuming you didn't touch a single cent in the account from 1st to 24th  for Feb 2024  you will meet the requirementjust on the dot  if your salary is $2584 (if salary credits earlier on 24th  since 25th is a Sunday) or $3875 (if salary credits late on 26th)  also only if you don't touch a single cent after salary credits.To help understanding MAB:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167928,btohqsg
Hi all  Just for info. For the Maybank Platinium Visa card  they told me that to qualify for the $100 cashback  I need to clock$500 for Insurance  $500 on other spend to be eligible for the cashback... =(,btohqsg
So it will still add my existing balance that I have from the 1st to 24th?,btohqsg
Yes this was discussed when it was broadcasted in Oct 23.,btohqsg
Didn't know of the change... =(,btohqsg
Should have joined the group earlier 😛Welcome to the group.,btohqsg
Yes on the daily. That's why averagedailybalance.,btohqsg
What other cards can I use? I clock about $1k every month for insurance...,btohqsg
You can use ipaymy to clock 500 with a small fee. I'm testing this as we speak  just got the card last month.If this is your first quarter month (meaning your card was approved last month)  you can try this method. But if this is not your first quarter month  just forgo the next 2 months.,btohqsg
am thinking of using Citi PayAll instead...,btohqsg
You can get CRMC and earn miles when paying your insurance premiums with City PayAll. Pairing with Amaze card you can earn miles with better FX rates for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Good luck for your miles accumulation journey.If you still want to get cashback  can look into HSBC EGA for 1% cashback for GIRO payments  including insurance and non HSBC card payments.,btohqsg
Citipayall normal time is only the base rate of 0.4 mpd?,btohqsg
That's true. Alternatively@Mamoru202207can get Citi PremierMiles for 1.2mpd instead.,btohqsg
