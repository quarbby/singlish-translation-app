For me is less than 54,btohqsg
But wtv i dont care liao,btohqsg
Oh sorry I mean 11 L1R5 raw score,btohqsg
Tho i need l1r5 <20 for courses i like,btohqsg
But I estimate should in actual fact be about 12/13,btohqsg
I think I got only 19/30,btohqsg

I heard some of the stuff wrongly and there was this annoying fan in my classroom that made a high pitched sound  ask the Cher to turn it off but they did nothing,btohqsg

Its called having a sense of humour,btohqsg
There was one of word I heard “the study can help us solve our problems” instead of “solve animals problems”,btohqsg

I feel like I might go to jc but after J1 I start hating it and drop to poly,btohqsg
