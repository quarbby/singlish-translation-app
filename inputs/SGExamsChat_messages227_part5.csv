"nope  but you'd think i wouldn't have my ass prepared to be working a lot more than i should be rn  :"")yeah money is a huge factor",btohqsg
Don't worry   nothing is too hard to get   as long as you are consistent,btohqsg
You get farther by Studying 3 hours daily for 1 year than studying for 10 hours a day for one month and then not studying the rest of the year,btohqsg
then do well for ur a levels too  and money won't be an issue,btohqsg
i researched abit on that but i'd only be able to gauge only so much based off possible o lvls grades  right?,btohqsg
nah scholarship won't really factor o lvls,btohqsg
ah screw that   i was sarcastic HAHAHAi can't tell bc i haven't even gotten into poly yet,btohqsg
idk what it factors la  but grades do matter for scholarship,btohqsg

if you don't know what are the requirements of your goals,btohqsg

idk what i wanna do too,btohqsg
but even if u don't have a plan,btohqsg
it's better to be hyper aware of all possible options,btohqsg
y'a  maybe aware would be a better word,btohqsg
of which most ppl r not anyway,btohqsg
like I don't even need you to tell me,btohqsg
what you want to be 10 years later,btohqsg
