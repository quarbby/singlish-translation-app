Oh then i went wrong sch,btohqsg
Which jc has the best food,btohqsg
depends on what scholarship the student is taking.,btohqsg
Only poly near me is nyp. Their food not great,btohqsg
NYP last time still got mac,btohqsg
dunno has it come back after closed down,btohqsg
NYP got a few canteens maybe need to explore,btohqsg
Tone down already. Probably due to change in management. But the old AJC math dept is strong. After merger....,btohqsg
Lol my classmate thot got 97 but when he heard someone got 98  he started hitting the table hard,btohqsg
Tbh i legit think he need,btohqsg
cos next time in life how,btohqsg
Tia gong rather u study hard now,btohqsg
Like when someone higher than him  he start cursing and hitting wall,btohqsg
hi guys! what is your opinion on dropping Higher Mother Tongue at Sec 3 year end?,btohqsg
ASR value add more than SAJC,btohqsg
u can always approach the teacher,btohqsg
i judge quality of departments based on difficulty of papers,btohqsg
not based on performance of students,btohqsg
drop lor if it helps other subjects,btohqsg
sometimes i passby i see students wait at gate,btohqsg
either wait for parents  delivery or lovers,btohqsg
drop off at main gate i guess,btohqsg
i can also say im XJC reject cos my COP didnt meet XJC,btohqsg
is anyone gonna come poly ðŸ‘€ come NP :),btohqsg
SAJC alot of rejects from ACJC and TJC,btohqsg
haish why everyone jc one so sed :<,btohqsg
then maybe ACJC alot of rejects from NJC VJC etc,btohqsg
but the poly course I want required subjects is English  E Math/A Math  Chinese/Higher Chinese and best 2 other subjects,btohqsg
Cant believe affiliation us still a thing thou,btohqsg
Yea but its a rather unfair system,btohqsg
it wld be better w Higher Chinese in it too right? [I'm gonna apply for EAE nxt yr],btohqsg
go see pm I send u,btohqsg
Like just becus u live in a higher ses area  u have a higher chance of going to elite schs becus of ur pri sch,btohqsg
where to find lit past year a level papers,btohqsg
Acs barker unaffiliated 240+ affiliated 190,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why the percentage of ACS Barker students that enter ACJC,btohqsg
Is much much lower than you would expect,btohqsg
Just becus u were brought up near an elite sch  u have a greater chance of going to an elite sch,btohqsg
From a school thatâ€™s literally branded as ACS,btohqsg
like what r the odds of that?,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure only teachers have that stuff,btohqsg
Literature is not a subject you can really study without a teacher,btohqsg
Unless if you really really love the texts,btohqsg
Yea i wld assume so. The people in these schs are more likely higher ses  so more resources to devote to tuition  etc,btohqsg
Nah im in jc just tryna spot qns HAHAH,btohqsg
like 1 in 10 students wld be liddat,btohqsg
Btw now that the psle score change  how is affiliation affected?,btohqsg
They should stick the to old grading system imo,btohqsg
That's the issue that they're trying to solve,btohqsg
In the old system literally every single mark matters,btohqsg
