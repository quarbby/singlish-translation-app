But still confused I’ve been there in childhood all I heard is some type of Chinese,btohqsg
You’ve said it yourself childhood that was donkey years ago I assumed,btohqsg

But if meI’ll choose a more secluded area,btohqsg
Eh not secludedLess touristy area should be the word?,btohqsg
Maybe not Indonesia…..Many black magic there,btohqsg
You have 6 million  you can let black magic do your bidding,btohqsg
Recently watch some black magic movie,btohqsg
Need to increase my Kang Kang power,btohqsg
I just came across a tiktok video,btohqsg
The helper did black magic on the family,btohqsg
Recent news saw some Singaporeans living in Bali  they work in media…can go to and fro Singapore and bali.  Living expenses cheaper than sg,btohqsg
I saw a tiktok video is a lady who kenna black magic from her colleague who gave her some kuehs to eat.,btohqsg
Also need to be in the right industry that can telecommute work,btohqsg
Ya lo. If we work in office 9 to 5 and no wfh  doubt we can do that,btohqsg
The thing is the motive behind it. Hmm,btohqsg
In the video  there is no explanation on why the colleague wants to do that. Maybe the lady has a happy family?,btohqsg
Amk ave 10 Chong boon market has the world number 1 Mee Soto.,btohqsg
So u believe it exists ?,btohqsg
Hang ur bra at ur corridor,btohqsg

Same! I also came across that video,btohqsg
My reaction same as the hosts,btohqsg
Sg already have liao right. The helper put her period blood into the food,btohqsg
How to make a man fall in love with u also similar method,btohqsg
There is this real life case in sg  an Indo maid tried to put black magic on the employer but the employer found out. Wanted to send the maid back but she pleaded not to  so the employer relented.However after that the employer resented the maid and started abusing her until it was very bad. End up he got sent to prison for abuse,btohqsg
He not a good storyteller leh. 😂😂,btohqsg
So many telltale signs of lies,btohqsg
The way he tell the story like he thinking what to say,btohqsg
Maybe the wife being unreasonably difficult… but he trying to keep the peace and not blame her while also airing is grievances,btohqsg
So no choice  the maid kena blame,btohqsg
Wah the way he tarik the smell….,btohqsg
No. Don’t believe in it. Tho my wife often tell me otherwise,btohqsg
Speaking of smell…. I came into the office with the wet shirt odour,btohqsg
There are unexplained forces in the world,btohqsg
Take off the shirt and air-dry it,btohqsg
See the way he tarik the smell makes me wanna tarik as well,btohqsg
Take off ur shirt to give ur colleague,btohqsg
In conclusion  take off ur shirt,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s an issue for him,btohqsg
I still prefer the overwhelming perfume,btohqsg
Not sure what’s worse  assault on the nose or battering on the ears with a crying baby,btohqsg
I wanna offer my bra to him,btohqsg
U mean got airlines worse than United?,btohqsg
Dab some Tabasco on it. At least give him some diff flavour options,btohqsg
It’s not smelly okIt’s 女人味Not every guy got chance to smell de#BBFA,btohqsg
How u knw hers fragrance? 😏,btohqsg
They dont like too fragrance ..,btohqsg
First. The one that sells famous mee rebus. But his mee Soto even better,btohqsg
The one where the Pak Cik just sits on his high chair to take ur order,btohqsg
It’s sad that how many of us here recognise this legendary brand,btohqsg
You need to get the hooga sticks,btohqsg
another method i heard is burn the used pad and mix the ashes into his food or drink...damn er xin,btohqsg
Sad. Wan to Jiak but nobody to share with,btohqsg
Ur workplace no mcd also 😁,btohqsg
Must bus all the way to boon Keng,btohqsg
After work lo. Share with ur wife,btohqsg
Now she eat Kan healthy. Chicken breast  avocado  eggs all that nonsense,btohqsg
Tell her eat 1 day cheat meal,btohqsg
Her cheat meal day is Saturday. And she won’t make it McDonald’s also ahahah. She don’t really like,btohqsg
She would rather her cheat day be bubble tea and sushi,btohqsg
Why ah? Our SG food making her fat ah?,btohqsg
How i wish i dont like jiak fast food 😁,btohqsg
Nowadays i also take less fast food liao,btohqsg
Must maintain ahUr 10kg lossDon’t put it back on hor,btohqsg
Her weight fluctuates quite a lot with our food.. idk why,btohqsg
I think bs la cos Thai food sugar more than rice grain. But it’s true her weight fluctuates easily,btohqsg
I think it’s just food in general and not specific to the cuisine,btohqsg
She’s a bi tang. Can gobble damn alot of rice,btohqsg
Easy to feed lehNow feed avocado so expensive,btohqsg
10 mins late to the party yo,btohqsg
Dunno why I don't really have craving for this,btohqsg
Ya lor. I try to buy only when promo la like 3 for $5-$6 kind,btohqsg
Same. I eat once. So so,btohqsg
For now. When I back sg confirm whack nonsense food,btohqsg
Where in the world are u now? Answering Thailands call of falling birth rate ?,btohqsg
I only eat avocado when i eat subway or with sushi 😁,btohqsg
I spent a month with orang asli,btohqsg
I think avocado is a damn overrated fruit caused by the hipster gang,btohqsg
Not really. Cos now she don’t take pure diary also. Must oat or almond milk. Knn buy Starbucks also kena this hipster tax of extra 80 cents,btohqsg
My wkends dinner just oats 🤣,btohqsg
All those oat milk  almond milk  when I was overseas  they are so much cheaper,btohqsg
Probably the price of fresh milk,btohqsg
I hate oats with a passion. Oats should just get infected with black plague and die off,btohqsg
In all seriousness.. I think it’s ok in small quantity.. like use it to make coffee I can take,btohqsg
But I won’t drink it as it is,btohqsg
I like it cos got the oats fragrance,btohqsg
U mean here la. Fresh milk is even cheaper overseas cos they can get local produce..  here.. local ah.. maybe goat milk.,btohqsg
I usually don't order avo. Extra costs.,btohqsg
Small quantity per goat production ma,btohqsg
Mostly texture based.. nice as guacamole.,btohqsg
You mean….. u don’t like Mai Pian Xia??,btohqsg
I used to do avo with milk n add a scoop of ice cream on top,btohqsg
Not made from oats?Oats is Mai Pian right?,btohqsg
Avo won't appear on my subway sandwich. I usually prefer meatballs,btohqsg
Pico de Gallo you mean? Well done that's awesome.,btohqsg
I usually won't put tofu cos I know I don't eat.. usually someone put in and lost and forget about it and overcook till it crumbles.p,btohqsg
Google says cereals is mixture of diff grains including wheat   rice  corn & oats.  Oats content counts only a small % or even zero in cereals,btohqsg
I will put cheese tofu 😁,btohqsg
Cereals mostly processed stuffs unless u really so health conscious then buy those rolled oats etc 😂,btohqsg
Normally i will try new flavours,btohqsg
Then u have to cook them..,btohqsg
I don't fancy subway usually. Sick of them when I was overseas 😅,btohqsg
Orhhh .. last time when i really diet .. i bought those need to cook. Cook liao taste like porridge,btohqsg
When i lost 15kg that time la🤣,btohqsg
I don't really care.. 🤣 give me mcd,btohqsg
I don't like eat tofu too,btohqsg
I need to be healthy le cos im now like 82 yo body,btohqsg
Tofu in mala soup is nice.,btohqsg
Tell me more ways to eat tofu??😂,btohqsg
Wan to eat just eat.. no point making yourself miserable eating stuff you hate cos you will still have to die anyway,btohqsg
Mash tofu with minced meat  steamed it with egg,btohqsg
If u are going thru what i experience now.. swollen leg for few mths,btohqsg
End day is eat n b happy n die. Or don't eat don't be happy n suffer longer 🤣,btohqsg
If cannot eat then dun risk it to eat,btohqsg
Gout is nth . Not life threatening like my case,btohqsg
My case anytime i can die de,btohqsg
U can try drinking apple cider,btohqsg
Uncle had gout last time  he drank it daily for a few months. He had outbreak but he he continued to drink. Then he recovered. Nowadays he drinks 1 glass like weekly. His gout never returns,btohqsg
The best is still apple cider,btohqsg
During the process will outbreak. But it will subside after a while. Then after the whole period over. U just take it occasionally,btohqsg
Sometimes he drinks like once every 2 weeks or so,btohqsg
But the smell I really no like. It's terrible imo 😅 just hold ur breath m drink,btohqsg
Then u need take food lor,btohqsg
Idk. I don't like the smell of it,btohqsg
Uncle said 1/2cm apple cider vinegar in cup then filled with water. 😂😂 Then hold breath  bottles up.,btohqsg
I don't remember this got strong smell,btohqsg
I still spat it outApple cider I really cannot tank sia,btohqsg
Just sour! Some dont like.. its femented tea,btohqsg
Fresh 1 I can drink. But those in bottles 1 not as nice 😂,btohqsg
But anyways my mum drinks apple cider for yearsHer leg still cui,btohqsg
I bought those in powder form...mix with water,btohqsg
I asked my ex colleague try. His gout also recovered,btohqsg
But apple cider not for very old folks. It's too acidity for them. For their bones n teeth etc no good,btohqsg
This type.. if i go over to my sis place  i can pass u some to try,btohqsg
"Oh my bro say ""Very rare outbreak. Yes apple ciders   lemon water helps""",btohqsg
This more like for digestion n easy bowel movement. Some may lose weight.,btohqsg
Is it good? I mean do u feel it effective?,btohqsg
I been taking this n plain water,btohqsg
Apple cider buy the normal brand 1. See bottom if chalky n got bits. The more the better,btohqsg
I have many flavours de. Peach  kiwi  apple  passionfruit  grapefruit,btohqsg
I bought that too. From very cheap last time 1 big bottle maybe 7  8 bucks. Now 1 bottle like 14+?,btohqsg
Shopee got sell. But i bought mine fr facebk seller,btohqsg
Wah sounds interesting. Which 1 ur fav,btohqsg
Ya i also bought it. Sometimes ntuc sells 2 for a cheaper price,btohqsg
Have to wait for offer 🤣,btohqsg
I didn't buy often now cause uncle don't drink as fast,btohqsg
I don’t drink too much also coz i am scared my stomach cannot tahan. I drank it neat with olive oil and some chilli powder,btohqsg
Just when u all go buy  choose the 1 with more laobu (mother) in it. Better.,btohqsg
They said more laobu  more effective,btohqsg
But i am thinking of making it myself,btohqsg
Dunno i got the time or life to do it or not,btohqsg
I no good at such stuffs 😅,btohqsg
haha more things to buy for 11.11,btohqsg
Last time I buy I see offer or at interesting I buy. Then I got more time  I start to read labels,btohqsg
Cause I nothing better to do,btohqsg
Is it drink le will Lao sai ah,btohqsg
I need stuff that helps me shit,btohqsg
