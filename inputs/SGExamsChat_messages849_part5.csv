Aside for TP law  is A levels the way to join law related faculty as student ?,btohqsg
Like I heard of ITE students joining unrelated Poly course later in life,btohqsg
Either job experience or good enough GPA,btohqsg
Hmm this one i not so sure,btohqsg
Maybe business since they study like business law but other than that  idk,btohqsg

Well one thing I have to emphasise is that ITE isn't intended for discrimination at all   it is a vocational style school to give students who don't do well in academic a second chance in life. But I have to also mention sth,btohqsg
Make sure you don't repeat mistakes either when you retake o level or go ite.,btohqsg
is polytechnic considered a vocational college pathway,btohqsg
Poly is a mix of vocational and academic,btohqsg
I mean there are ppl who entered Poly with high score and fail too many times too,btohqsg
would u consider poly as more of vocational  cause it feels more of 75% hands on work while 25% of it is academics,btohqsg
Yea there are a mix of theoretical and academic learnings,btohqsg
I know of classmates who didn't take Poly seriously GPA too low for 2 semester,btohqsg
