You get the rebate from the offset from selling price? Or during deregister,btohqsg
the 45k deduction is given when u purchase new vehicle,btohqsg
when u buy a new car  u will see the ves rebate 25k  and EEAi 20k rebate so total is 45k rebate  off the arf taxes. so example i use an bmw 330 arf is $54640  + $15000 ves surcharge  and it will be a total $69640 arf  but if it is an ev  the arf will be $54640 - $45000 instead and it is only $9640  so u buy an ice u pay $69640 arf  but u buy ev u pay $9640  this is a huge difference espcailly if you got loan for the car,btohqsg
wont it affect the resale of it too?,btohqsg
now hard to said as every car u sell is earn money haha,btohqsg
haha thats true  only time will tell👍👍,btohqsg
u go and see all ev  the arf very low 1,btohqsg
exactly haha  the ioniq 5 arf 16k but selling for 250k😂😂,btohqsg
compare to ice counter part  alot of ppl only look at coe  but if your car is more then 70k omv  the arf is 100k liao,btohqsg
arf is higher then coe in such instant  and if your cart is like 100k omv  the arf is like 160k lol,btohqsg
even without coe our car price still highest in the world,btohqsg
😂 more like rental company whack COE. If you see many new Altis hybrid PHV on the roadRental company after 3 yr deregister car. Pro-rate COE.,btohqsg
actually I dun see a lot new cars recently. maybe my neighborhood not atas enough😂,btohqsg
For premium cars 2nd car is very worth la haha,btohqsg
Can get 740 at 22 k depreciation,btohqsg
not worth if I need throw another 30k to repair  which I think most likely will need,btohqsg
can use 3 more years only,btohqsg
Then again  at the end of the term  your arf rebate on scrap will be much higher for the ICE car right?,btohqsg
Because you get 50% of the ARF rebate on scrap,btohqsg
So if the rebates are this high for EV bringing down paper ARF value  wouldn't the 50% be much lower?,btohqsg
Not too much of a difference that way  just about when you're getting your money back,btohqsg
so afterall is a 0 sum game innit🤠🤠,btohqsg
u pay upfront less but you sell for less,btohqsg
diplomatic car so no tax or coe 😍,btohqsg
There is still a slight advantage to the EVs with the VES rebate. That's most likely the savings you get,btohqsg
But one must also consider that with the new regulations coming in 2025  government may pull EV rebates as well and bring it down to just VES,btohqsg
Already the case in America  no more additional benefits for buying EVs from brands who have sold more than 100k EVs,btohqsg
