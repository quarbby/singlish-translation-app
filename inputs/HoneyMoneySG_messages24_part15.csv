Someone else asked earlier today also. Citibank excludes simplygo from 1.6% cashback even  so pls get the sc smart card lol,btohqsg
I guess the 6% best cb on mrt and bus right?,btohqsg
I know some cashback/miles cards are higher %  but as for no min spend and no annual fees  this is as good as it gets. Can get cashback for fastfood like kfc and macs and got sweet signup gifts on singsaver/money smart so nth to loseChris also did a video on this if you wanna refer ^,btohqsg
Oh didnt notice he had a vid on this. I try to find. Do you know how long ago?,btohqsg

I just used Amaze card to pay for an air ticket charged in EUR. The rate is very bad...,btohqsg

What did u use amaze with,btohqsg
Dear gurus - what is the best cashback strategy for paying insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Recurring or one-off? Recurring use Maybank Plat Visa. One-off use Amex TCB top up GPMC,btohqsg
I used it to pay for air ticket but because flying out from France so the ticket is charged in EUR.,btohqsg
1 SGD now is 0.7 Eurobut factor in 1% cash back and also credit card reward,btohqsg
If I have Citi rewards card  which excludes rewards for bus/mrt (4111)If I pair it with amaze card  am I able to earn the x10 points?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn't make item from excluded become included. It only change offline to online. The underlying MCC code need to be valid and not excluded,btohqsg
so roughly 2.5% fx fee  a little high eh.,btohqsg
but if you pair it with citi cashback+  then you will have 1%+1.6% cashback  think it acceptable lah,btohqsg
What are the mile credit card that I can use for bus/mrt?,btohqsg
It is recurring. Thanks. Let me check it out.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing   you must be a fan ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hi guys any tips for NSmen to start saving/building income? Should I get a credit card to have cashback or investment?,btohqsg
Hi guys  iâ€™m looking to open a UOB one account for the higher interest rate  any idea if monthly payment for  insurance counts under the $500 spendings?,btohqsg
Wanting to know for my knowledge:Person has two saving accounts one with DBS and one with UOB. Each account has a balance of 100K  how much money is insured by SDIC ? 75K or 150K,btohqsg
75k per acc holder for SGD deposit. If you have 65k in a saving acc with bank A and 25k in fd with bank A  only 75k is insured.,btohqsg
So for my example â€” 75K is insured per bank â€” so total of 150K is insured,btohqsg
May i know which cash-back card will you guys recommend for petrol?,btohqsg
Do you have a station you normally pump at?,btohqsg
Uob one or Citi Cash Back,btohqsg
How come is 1%+1.6%? I know Citi gives 1.6% but Amaze don't give 1% anymore for foreign spending.,btohqsg
Amaze give instapoints for foreign spend  which can be converted to cashback  TnC applies,btohqsg
Ya but max is 500points  even when I spend 2k  which is largely less than 1%.,btohqsg
it is capped at 500points per transaction  no cap overall,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how long it takes to get an email from citi after applying for their card?,btohqsg
What's the best Cashback card to buy redmart $500? Spree or Revo?,btohqsg
Currently using 1.6% citi+ cb card.  Thinking of using the citi rewards + amaze card and standard chartered for  bus/train or should i try for the maybank 8% or dbs live. My current expenditure mainly food/delivery,btohqsg
Redmart is groceries categoryMaybank f&f (groceries)Or citi smrt,btohqsg
Maybank f&f : Gotta see whether it suits your spending habitsneed min $800 spending. And the 5 categories.,btohqsg
instapoint is a kind of cashback?,btohqsg
Do u all know that POSB everyday is actually not that bad if u shop at Sheng Siong and take public transport. I was surprise to learn this from a friend. Always tot that this card always need min spend but actually not really the case.,btohqsg
Heyy for citicashback is mustafa considered a grocery shop,btohqsg
I think a note will be for transport  the 5% rebate has a promotional period till 31Jan 2023,btohqsg
Regarding syfe trade  does anybody know if Iâ€™ll still get sign up bonus if I fund $2k  trade once and then withdraw ~$1k?,btohqsg
By right is 5 to 7 working days. Its the 5th day for me. I'm still waiting. I am an existing premieremiles card holder applying for rewards. They called be and told me will be co sharing the credit limit. But till now have yet to approve,btohqsg
So as for now  don't have any method to withdraw money from Grab right?,btohqsg
Jist use for SGQR or payment online,btohqsg
Hi guys  quick question: what do you invest in with your CPF OA? (the 65% that can be invested in funds  not the 35% that can be invested in equities). Thanks,btohqsg
I have mentioned this somewhere - BonusSaver is a debit card with an annual fee. Why get this account ?,btohqsg
Ouchhh means can only slowly use it for payment already,btohqsg
Haha follow Honeymoney invest lionglobal infinity 500,btohqsg
I don't think you can get a credit card unless you have already been accepted into a university. You can get POSB Multiplier + POSB SAYE account  as well as SC Jumpstart. DBS Safra/POSB HomeTeamNS card also good since have 2% cashback on contactless spend with no min spend while you serve the nation,btohqsg
I've done this top-up and it works. JT is right  that the risk is that the cash is stuck there if you don't have a short term use for it.,btohqsg
