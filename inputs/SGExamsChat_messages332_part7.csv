ok honestly I've never been to a club so less reliable but it's what I hear,btohqsg
"Yes ofc  being an amateur waitress  ik need to clear plates and stuff la.But this jialat waiter saw me  clearing like clearing multiple tables with each table at least 4-7 huge ass plates by myself hor and i still have to set the cutlery and stuff..    ._.Hes  like ""if you dont want to help then i do everything byself  move  move(slightly raised voice)  I'll do everything by myself"" *he said a bunch of other things but i forgot yaa plus i think this is verbal abuse in a way lmao  almost made me cry bbut yea*I left that agency anyway because  my agent was shit and she didnt let me know about this kind of ppl... Basically lack of transparency in a way..after hearing my story  she did apologize ðŸ˜’ but she's like oh do you wanna transfer to another hotel restaurant? Dh him there onePlus only then did i realize that those kind of ppl(my agent for eg) dc u amateur or noob anot they just hire and allocate you...you need to brace yourself for this kind of shit.Furthermore  its kinda expected that you work like a pro with those waitress/waiter   clearing plates at saitama speed etc lmao if not ur screwed. At least that was the case for me la.",btohqsg
Eh anyway  life's just like that  cant expect myself to be spoonfed or wtv lol but thats my experience,btohqsg
But do take note  not every workplace is like this  some damn nice one. They do their job  you do yours  happy go lucky,btohqsg
