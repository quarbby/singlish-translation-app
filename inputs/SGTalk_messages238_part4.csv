NS is not that bad la. Gone very soft already. Mindset is very important. If u keep thinking itâ€™s terrible then for 2 years u will be very miserable. Just think like itâ€™s somewhere to hone ur personal soft skills and also to make friends,btohqsg

Yup. And those that I know who dreaded it made themselves very miserable that 2 years and keep carrying resentment.,btohqsg
Even for me like slow alr I ITE stage then they intro,btohqsg
Every generation of coding / coders have value because itâ€™s tagged to the systems in place. In sg got only 2-3 IT engineers still possess knowledge on some tech that certain big organisations still use and they are very well sought after even tho nobody will adopt that tech now,btohqsg
