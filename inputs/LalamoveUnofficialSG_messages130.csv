Wah jialat liao then have to secure a full time job then haha,btohqsg
Wtf so backdated also still want to investigate?,btohqsg
I got no idea man  dont know is they backlog that shit  or the customer playing punk and decide to report after so long,btohqsg
People need to learn how to read and/or not be cheapskates. Sick of oversized goods for bike. Don't take - so hard get compensation from LLM. Take - got chance of damage. Fk this,btohqsg
Ya I kena also. What has waiting time got to do with calling to confirm the order,btohqsg
I pissed off just end chat with CS,btohqsg
Looks like it's a con job on ur acc by llm accounts dept . I kena extorted by llm a few years back. Llm  Wanted me to compensate restaurant 150$ worth of food for sending Abit late . Llm called me a month later saying restaurant asking for compensation of $150.I called the restaurant boss whom I was already so familiar with . He said no . So I called back llm to the handphone which called me. I told him I gonna make a police report with the restaurant against him. He then said maybe he made a mistake,btohqsg
Any ridiculous compensation wanted by llm a month after the delivery check with restaurant. If no  go make a fking police report cos it maybe a scam by llm office personnels,btohqsg
Simple logicFirst   cut salary treat drivers like cheap labourNext  abuse drivers don't pay wait time compensation at times.Next one maybe scam,btohqsg
I was planning to make police if they wants me to compensate such rubbish work they did,btohqsg
Maybe is it cos your account balance got a lot of money that why llm wanna cheat us haha,btohqsg
Siala after reading the chat i feel like LLM no government leh.,btohqsg
What are the benefits of withdrawing monthly?,btohqsg
Jalan besar to simei car order after minus commission $16.50. less than grabfood motorcycle price,btohqsg
They wait for u to delete ur evidence and proof after 1month .Then suddenly say u late  in fact is restaurant late. This kind of money style who donno ya,btohqsg
Since when llm have Cheng hu? Lol. Ask around advertising on car  paste sticker is how much outside market? Llm even allow customer to remark wanna sit in car to be fetched already broken the law. All drivers here have license to fetch customer?The only govt llm have is a dept forever reduce salary . It's abt 10percent reduction per annum,btohqsg
It's ok. Cos now only do llm when on the way to somewhere. 😂😂. Will not specially travel from point a to b just for llm. Like tdy. I use my car do grabfood . Rainproof. Easily 300$,btohqsg
I kept about $50 inside the wallet,btohqsg
what the difference between FP & Grabfood?,btohqsg
There is no car forgrab. Use motorbike acc    use car do. Panda have batch system. So I prefer do grab . Earn same as grab motorbike rider. But rainproof and safer. Weekends a lot orders. If do daily panda earn more due to their pay n incentive  system,btohqsg
Just register with a bike then use car do . Grab will be happier. Food safer,btohqsg
Wah not bad eh. Smart. But i think you have bike that why you can do this?,btohqsg
Any bike can register. My fren use bicycle lol. His orders are all clustered,btohqsg
You mean i can just use any bike number to register? LOL,btohqsg
Wont ask for pics meh for verify,btohqsg
Need  but u know a lot of rented bikes ya,btohqsg
In fact bicycle acc can even earn more. Clustered orders. Eg use wive acc do tgt la. We car so fast.,btohqsg
Stack is normal. So 2 acc means deliver 4tgt lor,btohqsg
Panda car. Means a lot stack at pandamart . Grab more orders,btohqsg
Hit all max incentive for grab u go count how much. That's why u see those ebike chiong like crazy lol,btohqsg
That what i think also. I just only process registration for FP car. Knn need to buy the equipment all $100,btohqsg
Incentive earn back. New joiner incentive,btohqsg
Yes that is not good. That's why grab better imo,btohqsg
Like that i register as bicycle but do with car also maybe can ah,btohqsg
Can why not. Do two acc tgt,btohqsg
Cos bicycle slow . We fast can be done,btohqsg
Record for grab daily orders is 70. Already around $500 lol. Sg record. Not me,btohqsg
Like that I also make acc sia,btohqsg
Anyone got 10ft lorry or empty 2.4m van? Got 1 job from sengkang to tamp ikea,btohqsg
Stacked orders if i not wrong. So in 1 job have multiple pick up or drop.,btohqsg
Yes $300 only on Sat and sunday. On 2 accounts tgt. each acc complete 25. Quite clustered so it's not tough,btohqsg
Wait you mean 2 accounts? LLM and Grabfood?,btohqsg
Just sharing.Make sure you guys call the restaurant before picking up.If no one answered  please contact CS. Cause if your order is late or not prepared. Lalamove will not compensate you for the time you wait .,btohqsg

Guys how many yellow or blue can we take at one time?,btohqsg
There’s an asshole tryna move cats and himself now.Asked to top up $10 more  he said ‘later I’ll call you back’.But instead  cancelled the order.Fucking rude and cheapo F!Request for the same guys!!,btohqsg
After acquiring expertise working in a firm  I began participating in personal trading. I am drawn to the abundance of data sources broadcasting data from anonymous sources. Even though many claim to be specialists  I am skeptical about relying on anonymous individuals without an established reputation. I recommend paying attention on the leading 5-10 world traders. Personally  I respect Arthur Hayes  a prosperous and witty person who enjoys identifying poor cryptocurrencies. His data is dependable  as he is a co-founder of a famous company. To locate his channel  type 'ProfTemW' in the Telegram search.,btohqsg
So that i can take note to avoid him,btohqsg
Hi guys. New here. how do we get the tribecar rental subsidy?,btohqsg
No 2 grab llm waste time. Orders don't stop for grab during weekends. Clustered. Sometimes go one mall pick up 2-3. 2 accounts may end up 5 stacks,btohqsg
No one answer better cancel . Restaurant issue not our issue,btohqsg
Depends on ur experience in neighborhood malls. Some loading bay free. Many of grab orders are road side restaurant.dont do in town. Suicide unless u motorbike,btohqsg
Yellow 3 blue take for what? Tdy is tdy tmr is tmr 😁😁,btohqsg
What car rental companies u guys use?😬,btohqsg
You do Part-Time? Got Personal car?,btohqsg
If not can go Apply Shariot  GetGo sometimes can use car and do a bit cos this llm do FT a bit not worth😂😂,btohqsg
Yah ll cannot ft  earn fuel money only,btohqsg

And enter cbd buildings some no grace period also,btohqsg
I see places like Paragon and Taka I won't take. Too troublesome,btohqsg
LLM should learn from other platforms man. Losing out alot but then again we can always go other platforms 😂,btohqsg
LLM orders start from 10-11amBefore that pointless to take10.30am to 7.30pm u can work lalamoveBest time slot,btohqsg
Our per hour rate too low,btohqsg
We want to hit 25/hrs also had,btohqsg
Hougang to BB far sia but if from Henderson is ok.,btohqsg
That is not nett.Petrol is $1-3 per hourAnd rental is $5-8 per hourOn averageAnd honestly 35 per hour is only for fri sat sunWeekdays afternoon u take a ride hougang to suntec only $14  driver after commission take only $10.48. After petrol and rental left $5and thats 30 mins and at suntec no calls at all.Grab drivers suffering bro,btohqsg
River Valley side  not central mall side,btohqsg
Yaaa  times are bad now. Can go to as low as $20/hr on weekdays,btohqsg
Times bad now isn't an excuse for llm to continue slash salary. Per annum slash 10percent. Do we see other platforms doing that ? 10percent per annum,btohqsg
Not as bad as llm la,btohqsg
Llm more so. Need take trolley carry up and down the hdb flats. Absorb parking fees in malls especially town and mbs due to delivery walk walk.We can count how a car driver earn in llm. Some said deficit lol,btohqsg
This one nett or no nett. Go ride a bicycle la. No expenses lol. No pressure. What u take is what u nett earned. Grab ebike uncles have mistress one leh,btohqsg
Driver park inside mbs cp confirm deficit,btohqsg
Oh.... paiseh man . But Even so they still do better than llm. If they want more drive more hrs. Mrt must be super packed these days . Nobody wanna grab,btohqsg
Where all the money in this society gone to ? Circulate round and round drop to where?😂😂. Everyone suddenly no cash to spend.,btohqsg
Of cos la..if not I still need do llm  n grabfood. So where to? Hawkers also say cnt sustain. Where the money ?,btohqsg
Dun have leh. I exited ard 9mins $3.10 gone,btohqsg
U do llm ft ar? 1030-730 these days can nett earn how much with car?,btohqsg
U go try uob plaza. $6,btohqsg
Mbs got 15mins right if i not wrong,btohqsg
Good Regular Llm customers at mbs will always input remarks or wait at casino taxi stand,btohqsg
Idk forgot. I scared la. There too big. mbs paragon ion I scared la. Waste time waste money only. Sometimes got concert siao liao lor,btohqsg
They know if they don't do that   delivery can delay due to parking,btohqsg
I tell you all honest ah,btohqsg
I'm the driver that works from 9am to 7pm without fail,btohqsg
But what I mean is grab easily within this period 300 serioisly,btohqsg
I have seen friends doing it,btohqsg
I just feel llm abit underpriced,btohqsg
Wait   ur nett leh? Underprice sure la. We know the market,btohqsg
I mean haven't deducted t petrol,btohqsg
Ya as in just nett earnings,btohqsg
Ok la LLM for me is about $150 nett exclude petrol and parking. Car is my own.,btohqsg
I don't chiong or stack orders often also  lazy to think lol,btohqsg
But I mean still have to consider the expense la,btohqsg
Grab motorbike they tell me after expenses daily 250 abv. But danger,btohqsg
Cause in a way we also using the mileage,btohqsg
Don't forget can summon by LTA,btohqsg
If the normal price is around festive e price,btohqsg
I leave around 10/11 sometimes even 12,btohqsg
Then I do until order stop so around 7pm take last order or smth otw home,btohqsg
But it’s damn fked up cos I see all the other apps earn more while I need provide labour and service knn,btohqsg
But then again people will say why we don't do hrav,btohqsg
I won’t take town area. Not worth,btohqsg
Ya I never ever take town area,btohqsg
Guys  how to prove that i did not send the item to the wrong unit?,btohqsg
Wah  i 2 years nvr do lalamove only become so jialat now ah?Last time pricing still reasonable but can stack.Now seems like price cui and cannot stack.Worse is under their terms and condition llm got 1 hr to send.They shld really do lalamove express. If dont allow stacking.Anyway to llm as long as drivers keep taking  they will see no point to increase price.Like grab now  during off peak will lowball the pricing.They know pax will book because cheapest.And out of 5 drivers just need 1 to accept can liao,btohqsg
240 gross? I assume u havent minus ur overhead and labour costs,btohqsg
As in 240 is llm net earnings,btohqsg
But If want count as rental,btohqsg
"Hi guys  i have been doing lalamove for awhile. Recently i picked up an order that says pick up now but i was delayed for 26mins to pick up the order as the person told me it wasnt rdy yet. I was expected to deliver on time despite the delay. That dont make sense at all. And i was penalized. I keep asking them questions on why was it so but all they reply was to ask me to fill up a waiting fee form to claim. Its as good as telling me ""fuck you"" in the face. Just to warn drivers out there better not pick up orders that expect u to deliver a strict timing where u cnt meet when they delay you and it was my mistake on my end. Wont be using this platform to deliver anymore🙏🏼",btohqsg
Shag sia. Order late then become our problem,btohqsg
No wonder LLM so happy to recruit new drivers so many trap waiting  for them...,btohqsg
If person A takes 1.5 hours to complete 6 delivery destinations but got delayed by 26mins at the first destination  how long will person A take to reach the final destination?Lalamove: 1.5 hours,btohqsg
How can we scam someone legallyLalamove:,btohqsg
LLM now simply can't do for cars above I feel,btohqsg
That's why I don't take multistop orders,btohqsg
hmm i came across before but for $1 who want to take sia,btohqsg
That is LLM staff make a mistake which should have $1 + some value but overall not worth it. For 25 locations,btohqsg
Send to Jurong or tuas area worth anot?,btohqsg
depends on pick up location...but good thing is tuas/jurong got a few places that want to go to other parts of SG  so dont have to worry about not many jobs available after delivery,btohqsg

A gentle reminder for all bros & sis here just in case you urgently need the money after cash out from llm. Make sure your wallet is not in negative amount or you top up your wallet.Case study: I cash out $400 from llm app on sun night and as usual the money will only credit into my acc on coming wed.So after the cash out my wallet left with only $0.18 cents.Monday I night I do only 2 job and coincidentally both job are paid by cash.So after all the comm deductions my wallet is negative $4.00++Today I open up llm app want to accept job only to realize my cash out failed. llm system revert all my cash out back to my wallet due to wallet in negative amount because I didn’t top up my wallet.So I lan lan have wait for next week in order to receive my money,btohqsg
Another method is to choose paid by credit job so that your wallet got sufficient amount.,btohqsg
I mean make sure wallet got sufficient amount during the 3 days crediting period before money credit into your acc.,btohqsg
Hi  just joined LLM. May I know the diff between car  courier etc? How do we get the customer to sign on receiving the items? TIA.,btohqsg
Courier means parcel like items. Car can be anything meant for car-load from food  parcel etc.,btohqsg
Once you accept job  press call customer and there is option to call customer or press the arrow for GPS. There will be orange bar that says arrived but do that only when you pick up the items already and need pic as proof.After that  same thing  press call customer to get to GPS and once arrived  press the orange bar and it will prompt confirm drop off? Press yes and it will bring you to take pic for POD or customer sign,btohqsg
I tot got timing to swipe when u arrive and take photo when u pick up. Use that timing to note that u actually arrived but food isn't ready. In such cases also msg llm Cs to get compensation for 20mins wait.,btohqsg
Actually just follow step by step the instructions when u get the job. Throw aside all fear and try  after a few jobs it's 2nd nature liao,btohqsg
Experience it yourself n trial n error is best way to learn,btohqsg
Just double check everytime to make sure your map bring you to the right place. I kanna a few time map bring me to the wrong place,btohqsg
I hope I dare to take my 1st step🤣,btohqsg
One week can earn how much,btohqsg
Not too long later you will only feel numbness and frustration 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Cannot don do LLM or feel Sian?🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I hope I won’t make mistake. Scared making mistake and got to compensate it,btohqsg
Is LLM the only platform for doing freelance delivery?,btohqsg
It's seriously not the right time to join llm,btohqsg
But guess their doing their marketing well that's y more n more pple joining,btohqsg
If your riding bike I think maybe still can  but if car and above then good luck,btohqsg
really only worth to do if it's along the way for u,btohqsg
I see. As my free hours are limited (9am-1pm) the most,btohqsg
Now many jobs in llm  the mileage fee is very discounted. And the drivers are the ones who bear the discount. Not llm,btohqsg
The price given in LLM  exclude comm right? We have to give them a cut too?,btohqsg
So unless the jobs have decent priority fees added or high demand surge  in the long run it's totally not worth the effort. Ur having to use more petrol and accumulating more mileage to your vehicle to earn lesser $,btohqsg
By right the actual price should b,btohqsg
I see. Really very little hor,btohqsg
Not worth doing unless along the way pick n drop,btohqsg
Mileage fee = $3(for 1st 3km) + $13.05($0.45*29km)=$16.05,btohqsg
So total fee by right should b $28.05,btohqsg
I was wondering should I start? I haven’t place ky security deposit,btohqsg
But llm started the stupid discount for vendors this yr,btohqsg
Discount on mileage fee  which is pushed to drivers🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Have to put in double the effort and might not even make more than b4,btohqsg
Yes. Everything so thinking to earn some pocket money 😂,btohqsg
But yet I see many pple joining,btohqsg
Wkends especially sooo many part timers do  prices get pushed down more,btohqsg
I can only do on weekdays morning 😭,btohqsg
I don't know if bikes still ok,btohqsg
I'm speaking from a car driver point of view,btohqsg
Bikes tough to ride in weather conditions n also face more danger on the rd,btohqsg
But they in a way can complete jobs faster,btohqsg
And when comes to parking prob easier n cheaper than cars,btohqsg
Nowdays more courier jobs  car jobs getting lesser. Cos courier cheaper,btohqsg
U can try. After some time u gauge whether worth it,btohqsg
By the way  don't expect much  if any back end support,btohqsg
Llm is different from grab etc,btohqsg
Llm sides with their customers(vendors) 95% of the time,btohqsg
They basically couldn't care less abt their drivers/riders,btohqsg
Make sure ur hp has lot of space,btohqsg
Cos u need take many photos/screenshot etc to cover ur backside when doing llm,btohqsg
N have to keep for quite a few mths,btohqsg
I'm just telling you what all those lalamove marketing and advertisements don't tell you. They sugar-coat everytg only,btohqsg
Min 5k monthly income. Minimum 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂😂😂,btohqsg
N earn up to $190 per order. I do few years liao  nvr see b4 for car. Maybe lorry have,btohqsg
Those who believe and join also smoking crack,btohqsg
Orders usually 10.30am to 7.30pm daily,btohqsg
U try to take these orders along chinatown/temple/smith  ayerrajah  taisengeasier for youCar dont take robinson/tanjong pagar/cbd and dont take ion/313/somersetNo place to park  some place one time entry more than $5,btohqsg
recently i kena one damn order at tai seng  some industrial building,btohqsg
the shop took >10min to prep zzzzzzzz  kena charge $2 parking,btohqsg
Sometime some area lvl 1 no Carpark or lot and have to drive until top lvl which the order is and when by the time take and come down kena charge already,btohqsg
Lol I stop doing since last July. Now not much jobs. Last time can stack jobs the night B4 and earn Ard 200 a day during weekend. Now a little here n there  can't stack n paddle give so little time to deliver.,btohqsg
5k can. Do whole day non stop dun care location. But deduct petrol maintenance dunno left how much,btohqsg
Take note the charge for car and courier is different as well,btohqsg
Don't have so many jobs to win bid each day😂,btohqsg
Last time don't need stack advance jobs to earn 200 on wkend. On the day itself do the immediate jobs have good prices n will surge n +$. Last time don't have soo many sudden influx of part time drivers and have more jobs,btohqsg
Now toooo many part time wkend drivers n little jobs. All jobs b4 chance of any surge or + are taken at a low price,btohqsg
Thats y its no longer a good choice to do llm,btohqsg
Good luck with your future endeavours with LLM. You picked a bad timing to join.,btohqsg
Nowdays when I open app to see sometimes,btohqsg
Jobs to or from mbs price so low still have pple take,btohqsg
I wonder how these drivers do it,btohqsg
Mbs cp expensive. And then if the main cp is full  they close the cp and they open the convention hall for u to park. But that 1 no grace period at all. N its $23 flat fee. Minus the cp earn wat,btohqsg
Some pple say can park outdoor cp. But that 1 also have queue. Then if raining  it's a long walk😂,btohqsg
Its the same for all the town/cbd jobs. Last time price high can tahan cp. Now price low taken  how to make 5k/mth after minus operating costs. Park illegal kena summon worse😂,btohqsg
Do non town jobs  longer distance jobs  mileage fee kena cut so much 🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
Do llm similar to become low wage workers lor,btohqsg
Earn more coz 100% profit coz no rental + keep fit,btohqsg
During covid  demand very high. Prices very high. Is buffet spread for us. That time many pple don't join llm  maybe scared. Then now after covid demand drop till cui. Then more pple join. 🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
Then cos demand drop  llm lower their price to retain customer n biz. Then price low old drivers start to no do  the jobs hang there. So the best solution for llm? Do hard and aggressive marketing for recruitment. More drivers  new drivers  see price still higher than grab etc. Then do,btohqsg
But  correct me if I'm wrong  the other food delivery platforms price per job low but their incentives high. U get reward for hard work.,btohqsg
N they don't need to bid for jobs  the platform throw to them. Llm still need bid n bor bao get the job,btohqsg
Even festive seasons which used to be fierce like lion/tiger  now also cui liao. Last Yr Xmas llm like kitten  not even a cat😂,btohqsg
Cheapo. Prefer van but choose mpv!!!,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I would like to know if MPV or Van would be better for lalamove full time? What vehicles are good and practical? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Depends on what you want to ferryVan lorry of course more charges cause heavier load,btohqsg
If you want to rent a vanI have one available,btohqsg
Llm ft how feed family? Need multi,btohqsg
Yes   llm ft van max net profit 3.5k. u need deduct your expenses. The fares are low and jobs limited. Part time a few platform better,btohqsg
Okay bro thanks man  needed to hear that. 🙏,btohqsg
Looking for drivers to set up for eventsRequirements: to have their own mode of transport  car/van etc.Only sat and sun job,btohqsg
Before u rent   find out more alternatives  of cos llm is good for picking up and drop off on the way while having another platform job 😁😁. Van job within 2hrs   mpv 1.5hrs car job 1hr.,btohqsg
Yes  don't be misled by all their advertisements n marketing. If I'm not wrong  van jobs prices have dropped drastically. Quantity also drop.,btohqsg
Doing ft can. U have to be prepared don't earn much. If u have family commitments think u have to consider properly,btohqsg
Dropped from 37$ to $26 while all other expenses increase . A diff of 35-40%,btohqsg
No wonder I hear now vans also sometimes bid for car jobs,btohqsg
There was some competition between GGV and llm. That's how llm got more van drivers to paste their stickers 😂😂,btohqsg
Mpv was not present in the past. Mpv eventually meant for customers to abuse van drivers haha,btohqsg
All newbies being conned by all the ads😂🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Eg those need vehicles to carry 2boxes of 40kg in total used to call for van job. Now they use mpv or even car,btohqsg
They r being spoilt cos massive influx of newbies who will take anytg  bor bian,btohqsg
Van is better for parcels . Load all space and go send,btohqsg
Some are fake drivers   paid by MOM . Purpose to slash market. Benefit companies on expense of drivers,btohqsg
The whole thing going on now is the society getting seriously poor.,btohqsg
So word of advice to any newcomers thinkg of llm as ft  think again😂,btohqsg
The old saying the rich get richer is sadly true,btohqsg
Llm cannot FT . Can die one,btohqsg
Can do again if lockdown occurs again only,btohqsg
Possible that time during lockdown only😂😂,btohqsg
Govt no more money pay for ppl and companies for another lockdown,btohqsg
One more lockdown the world economy gameover,btohqsg
Y is there such a general misconception that gov no money,btohqsg
The money is always there n big amt,btohqsg
It's just they don't like to use it,btohqsg
Cos they want more n more,btohqsg
They set aside for other international investments perhaps,btohqsg
The money has been accumulated since ages ago,btohqsg
They have only spent a extremely small amt,btohqsg
Over the years how many of such spending have they done  can be calculated,btohqsg
But every year how much they collect😂,btohqsg
They buy gold as reserves   donation to the west 😂😂.,btohqsg
Again  is not game over. Is just that small percentile of the rich who control the world economy won't b happy they have to spend their obscenely big amount of money lor,btohqsg
Cpf over these decades may hit trillion liao,btohqsg
So wats the small little bit of money they supposedly spent during covid,btohqsg
Where the money ? Become all digital .,btohqsg
Which they have already collected back from tax revenue etc,btohqsg
A 1% increase from gst is massive,btohqsg
Everyday transactions for a whole year,btohqsg
All these is not written in newspapers,btohqsg
Jialat sounds like we pay protection fees,btohqsg
Then hdb price shoot high high,btohqsg
Cpf how much also useless lol,btohqsg
And part of the money they give us,btohqsg
Have a time limit to spend  aka cdc voucher😂,btohqsg
Ya Sia. They take from us   then return a bit want us appreciate,btohqsg
So when I hear pple say gov no money liao,btohqsg
Means they have anyhow invested all the money from us n lost it all,btohqsg
It will be a big scandal liao lor,btohqsg
Don't have to kena too long,btohqsg
From yound till now feel like kena tekan,btohqsg
Got good government when lky around,btohqsg
Then now gov cui but cos they old so have old people benefits,btohqsg
Live to pay a fking shelter,btohqsg
So what platforms are “okay” to consider?,btohqsg
I drive car  not many platforms if any are suitable for car,btohqsg
Try save as much as u can lor,btohqsg
Maybe buy property elsewhere which is cheaper  like Malaysia. Then retire there when ur kids old enough to work😂,btohqsg
Keep ur flat in sg then  rent it out,btohqsg
i heard grabfood also getting crowded,btohqsg
something's up la. demand relatively same but job fare lower on all platforms...,btohqsg
When u have big pool of delivery pple,btohqsg
Anyone got do these jobs from uparcel before? $107 for 14 drops  close together. Like very easy to do,btohqsg
the rate also end up around $14 per hour  same as F&B/warehouse/retail sales,btohqsg
Why only $14. Think based on the group cna at least do 3-4 drops an hour.,btohqsg
Haha U give it a shot first ba. I heard from my clicks is around $150 to $200 a day for car drivers. Again the algorithm comes into play,btohqsg
I'm doing this now. 13 places for $117.,btohqsg
The package just 100g only. Bike can take all liao,btohqsg
See how fast I can finish,btohqsg
I m not. Trying to do multiple platform delivery too.,btohqsg
haha let us know how long it takes,btohqsg
Uparcel is all credit based uh guys?,btohqsg
Yes no cash and payout is fixed schedule unless you request via the app,btohqsg
Can cash out next day is accumulated more than $200,btohqsg
Haha immediate next day reach bank account meh?,btohqsg
Henderson go yishun then drop all nearby. No jam,btohqsg
Who else got do uParcel before? Can share?,btohqsg
Even in the rain no jam meh today?,btohqsg
Prices norm not high I think. That's what I heard/saw last time lah😂,btohqsg
Nothing much to share la just that you don't really interact with humans lol but not so time pressure as LLM,btohqsg
Again I think more suitable for bikes,btohqsg
N u have to stack if u want to make it worthwhile,btohqsg
But I nvr do b4  all these is again what I hear😂,btohqsg
Yeah can stack and must stack,btohqsg
"Depends on order  got sender throw like one cake at me before for delivery lol. And they state ""no bikers please"" in order.",btohqsg
The problem is even with less time pressure you still end up at about $10 to $15 per hour lol,btohqsg
Interesting la haha seen many ppl join uparcel then left. Or should I say not work for uparcel jobs,btohqsg
For me I multi app and part time only so can slowly wait for payout and accumulate credits to cashout,btohqsg
How to earn more? Rent a van? I cannot see Van orders,btohqsg
Llm car orders cannot make it,btohqsg
U see the llm car order. One pick one drop  $10 plus only and so far,btohqsg
Many food orders from oddle. Everytime go kana wait. Parking also cannot cover,btohqsg
Sorry man no idea gotta ask around,btohqsg
But take note Uparcel takes 20% comm.. so what u see is before comm,btohqsg
Do more than 200jobs commission is 18%,btohqsg
Yes correct but that is 200 jobs for 2 weeks not monthly,btohqsg
Car how to fit shopping cart. Siao one leh,btohqsg
If one day one batch  can hit,btohqsg
All done for the uparcel batch,btohqsg
Thank you for anyone advice. Any other platforms can get good jobs?,btohqsg
Uparcel not everyday have batch order so not easy.. either must take the $7 job plus other batch job..,btohqsg
Grab food car order good price hard to come and only meal times,btohqsg
Car not good for delivery nowdays,btohqsg
Got my car jan 2020 then do llm,btohqsg
Sorry if I sound very negative,btohqsg
Uparcel maybe look attractive to you  but that's cos llm fare is bad now. Previously uparcel fare is regarded as cui😂,btohqsg
I think now better off using car for phv rather than delivery. Delivery demand has dropped  ridership demand now better,btohqsg
yeah right now customer know how to abuse u ya,btohqsg
U have to change according to how the environment changes,btohqsg
All these is referring to car hor😂,btohqsg
Cos I dunno how bike or van or lorry mkt is,btohqsg
As long as using car for delivery alr not worth haha,btohqsg
My car going scrapped liao so now trying out if can get van later,btohqsg
Use TADA or Ryde is best from what I heard,btohqsg
after 20% commission how much only,btohqsg
so many places they cluster tgther,btohqsg
those doing since last time know not worth it 😂,btohqsg
U divide by per location u only get $7 to $8 per drop.. do llm per drop is more if single order,btohqsg
Basically too many drivers liao. Quite a sizeable number of pple kena retrench recent mths,btohqsg
Not surprised if many doing delivery/phv,btohqsg
But I do the llm order only one drop each time. Distance so far. I saw the hamper delivery on llm $6 and need to do all over the place. After finish still need to return to serangoon to give invoices. How to do?,btohqsg
I saw an ad on pickupp and went to sign up. Sibei jialat,btohqsg
$3-4 also have. Bus fare also not enough,btohqsg
Do you have better lobangs can PM me?,btohqsg
That one is special project.. bo pian.. i only do single order drop off.. if batch is good but like i say minus comm minus per drop is diff compare to single drop,btohqsg
That’s the reason why got many low prices cos still got Kum Lan Kia took such order.Hillview to Bishan…even petrol FOC also mati la!,btohqsg
Today and tmr mbs got concert,btohqsg
So 6pm onwards becareful parking there 😂,btohqsg
Panda car u go try. Can play punk. U book shift  then start off at pandamart. Normal they give u stack 3-4 orders. U complete the last one don't press complete. Drive back pandamart press complete. More likely u get stacks of pandamart orders again. Pandamart orders good during weekends and daily after 6pm,btohqsg
That's why many been saying cannot do llm already. Unless on the way to somewhere stack llm into it,btohqsg
After petrol parking fees   time and  energy only worth 5 bucks per hour. I count before liao,btohqsg
Slowly add in expenses really $5 per hour sia,btohqsg
Bo hua la...long term run we lose everything,btohqsg
Only enuf to makan   drink pay handphone bill,btohqsg
Risky job leh. Accident how also,btohqsg
I see alot of drivers don't care 1 leh. The job price so low they also take. I think they all casino high flyer member  got free parking. 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
I just did n try 3 days .not worth it in my opinions,btohqsg
I am a loan broker. Can PM me.,btohqsg
"i think these low prices for all we know could be that companies are ""absorbing"" the GST 9% but we are the ones who who kena.",btohqsg
Less than $1 per drop 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
And each location it's like a lot of stuff,btohqsg
Buggy app...also 61 packages in one day sure die,btohqsg
Sorry to ask if llm all cannot do  why everyone still in this group?,btohqsg
Need to complain ma and ask for tips/help haha,btohqsg
Tonight orchard so jam. Killiney to plaza sing need 19mins wth,btohqsg
Cm cancel 3 time . I kena pause?!,btohqsg
Let's just put it this way. At least for me  I see how llm has been gg downhill  so to me cannot do liao lor. But if let's say ur new  n u feel the price ok  then by all means try it out,btohqsg
Agreed! To each his own hor?,btohqsg
Knn all these cheapo want to save money don’t want to book grab then come try here in llm,btohqsg
I reported a few order like this and scam order to llm CS but seems like they are not doing anything at all.,btohqsg
I was wondering do llm order system got filter order before release to driver or any order come in they just push out to driver,btohqsg
Obviously notLlm won't botherIt's position is I'm a platformWilling buyer willing sellerDon't take their case that's all,btohqsg
What time does the orders stop coming in?,btohqsg
$17.90 is not net.. after comm is only $14++,btohqsg
It’s 24/7 but usually night time the orders are slower to none.,btohqsg
Bs 24/7After 8 plus almost noneThen after 8/9 no assistance from llm sideYou come one clown you die,btohqsg
Esp cash job they don't pay you after thatYou slowly wait till next day,btohqsg
The platform 24/7 but you on your own after 8/9pm,btohqsg
Like what i said last time here 😂 LLM no government one. Is like black market delivery service.,btohqsg
Eh by the way the order is gone when I check back.. I don’t know job is taken or cancelled,btohqsg
Hopefully no bros or sis take the job,btohqsg
Not much use. Advice to u just ignore these orders. Not worth getting angry or pissed. Its common in llm now,btohqsg
yeah dont waste time  just report if u got time to do it,btohqsg
Yap. WASTE time Report. Thats why they Always PickUp now. We NO accept cannot trace the Booking as they can say at BackEnd NOT Approved since no Details given. We just IGNORED thiz kind as its A Norm to them😢😢😢,btohqsg
Hi good morning guys.Are three mod for lalamove?,btohqsg
Something like when a couple needs a van to make love..... Get llm van! 😂😂Drivers only do nothing and sit outside van. No govt,btohqsg
Drove past orchard  cainhill already jammed 😔😔,btohqsg

Full Time/Part time Food Delivery RidersSingaporean Or PR OnlyWeekly Payment  Can Earn Up To $1.3k to 5k Per WeekMonthly can Earn Up To $10K+++For More DetailsPlease WhatsApp @ 87580806,btohqsg
Anyone try live express before ?,btohqsg
Weekly up to 1.5k  mthly up to 10k+?,btohqsg
Anyone feel llm app very lag suddenly now,btohqsg
Bikes only? How can be possible to earn $10k,btohqsg
Heavy traffic + rain + customers cancelling when I reached already = Less than $10 per hour I think 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Sometimes even when not do  I accept ridiculous orders then send message to customers ask them to read the dimensions and max weight allowed for cars.Then tell them how will I want to send for anyone who don't follow the guidelines. Then I tell them cancel,btohqsg
Only grabfood possible. 10k. Need chiong 35 orders per day. Then take as many gems as possible in town during grab peak hrs. There are ppl who can do it consistently. But Sibeh shaq. Tgt with gems incentive and normal incentives 35order per day is abt 10k,btohqsg
OMG…..the fares for a rainy day….,btohqsg
I just join some telegram groups where ppl ask for riders.. I didn't try yet. It's low fare  but sometimes it's better than LLM after commission lol,btohqsg
But alot effort to look thru lol,btohqsg
At the end of the day still difficult 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Then you waste one space of your own order if they cancel too slow?,btohqsg
I luckily managed to get good bulk order,btohqsg
I think nowadays need take big orders,btohqsg
Then I let CS cancel.tell CS the customer don't know how read lalamove guidelines and try abuse lalamove and insult lalamove 😂😂,btohqsg
The customer try abuse llm   including CS and all drivers by ownself change llm guidelines. U think we should deliver for this customer? If I do  he will abuse it once again and ask his friends to do the same,btohqsg
The abv is how I tell the CS.,btohqsg
That's why 10k only for bike riders who works like robot. Not me la. I lazy.Llm is lazylazymover,btohqsg
"U try email to grab or gojek . Tell them "" bro  llm have black market to snatch your business."" 😂😂",btohqsg
Someone told me we as delivery drivers have 1 integrity* We don't get fk around by money like slaves   We use money to fk around.,btohqsg
What are these groups? Can share?,btohqsg
Then many naive pple see all these reports then join😂😂,btohqsg
haha like the team zaizai that time,btohqsg
dunno if that affects the algorithm (and payout) or not but have fun!,btohqsg
distance is all >99km for me now lolllll,btohqsg
The orders today really Sibei Cui,btohqsg
Modification such as lalahelper  so we got win bid the order,btohqsg
Idk who taking all these shit orders sia,btohqsg
May I check  if this is the balance  I need to deduct 20% of the comm before cashing out to my bank right?,btohqsg
Many foreign workers now. That day I met one at collection point.,btohqsg
This should be after commission already. So it's your real balance after working. Btw you can only cash out min $20 each time. Recommended to have some money (I leave $20 inside) in your wallet also  so that you can accept credit orders (as they will take commission from your balance).,btohqsg
I see. I just started doing one the other day. So thinking to do more tmr,btohqsg
U in KL is it lol,btohqsg
Can. Can do in foreign country. China also have llm,btohqsg
Mom employed drivers to slash market . They are monthly paid by mom. They have anything just take one. The purpose is to help companies sustain. Delivery fees for most platform  have been declining   llm most. Even full time delivery man for companies salary also kena cut . Cos companies saying outside can find cheapo ones( these are the mom employed assholes)Give u one authentic eg. They offering to delivery books to schools (abt 30kg of books per school )at $8per school. Those jobs are extremely tiring ones. Normal rate is abt $140 for 10schools. Total 300kg. They can slash to $80,btohqsg
This is what is ongoing now for 1.5years already . Sibeh dulan,btohqsg
Many doing liao lor. To them the price low also nvm. Alot drive their company van/lorry I think. I saw 1 the other day,btohqsg
Also have many part timers now who come out do on wkends. Any sai price also take 1🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
The deduction is done to the job price. So the price u see  will have deduction then leftover amt is ur income. Which will then be put into ur wallet. Unless is cash job  then they will deduct the commission and gst from ur wallet,btohqsg
Already so cui liao u still want use such mods to win bids,btohqsg
U ask them they tell u do volunteer work . Crazy one,btohqsg
If I don't have can still take the order??,btohqsg
If they say liao then u better don't take if u no android,btohqsg
The price for this job not high wor,btohqsg
Average each drop maybe 5-6+ dollars right,btohqsg
Sorry I think $5 only per drop,btohqsg
If u take the above job u show  its even less cos u need pay parking,btohqsg
14 drips only 60. 1 drop $4.28. Deduct cp liao I think only $40+. 1 drop only $3+🤷‍♂,btohqsg
So it is not worth it :) thank you for your advice. As really new and don't know which to accept (thinking easier for this kind of trip),btohqsg
Cbd area drops mostly need pay cp,btohqsg
Survive can. But have to live very simply lor if you want to rely on delivery full time. If not  have to try finding other full time jobs with delivery as part time,btohqsg
They sell  cosmetics and clothings. Most of their cosmetics are rejected from supplier . Many locals ladies buy from them much cheaper,btohqsg
Rejected cos of packaging issues. But when I see the batch code all very fishy one,btohqsg
Let the job hang there  price will slowly increase,btohqsg
Hi bros  looking for fish tank mover  which can help to collect by to9 from west to east  thanks,btohqsg
730am collect . Say 10 am finish . Untill now have yet to receive my invoice .Very hard to communicate,btohqsg
Wa this one walk until when sia,btohqsg
These are the drivers who spoilt the market.,btohqsg
What’s wrong with my app? All is Bukit Merah llm order,btohqsg
Nothing wrong. They tdy alot of jobs,btohqsg
If every1 don't take the price will go up lor. But many drivers will take  so 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Walker wor. U accept walker to do multistop  u 👍👍👍,btohqsg
So means he got multiple account then.,btohqsg
U can only keep calling/msg him lor,btohqsg
So cheap who want to do Sia. 1 drop less than $1,btohqsg
Thats y I say if the job hang there long enough price will go up lor,btohqsg
I hope u all don’t take,btohqsg
Lalamove know u guys won’t take one slowly up $2-$5 only,btohqsg
Price alr like shit to start with,btohqsg
There will b pple who take 1,btohqsg
End of the day  if the job fare is acceptable to whoever  then the job will be taken lor😂,btohqsg
Good buisiness. Rejected cosmetics sellers earn a lot,btohqsg
The price is 40-50percent less than boutique. They claim only packaging flaw,btohqsg
But inside is same as those in boutique,btohqsg
That day one rider told me he kena a llm order go the house change light bulb for an old woman,btohqsg
Get the mover ady thanks bro,btohqsg
Continue not taking the Bukit Merah order,btohqsg
I’m sure they can still give more one,btohqsg
They got diesel tag and lorry can bring back one. So during off day or after work can do,btohqsg
Still nobody take the Bukit Merah order for CBD lol 😂,btohqsg
The 2 left is the jialat one. Cp will take away maybe $20-30,btohqsg
Up to $9/stop liao but no good to do,btohqsg
Cp still ok. I think will waste a lot of time wait for the high rise lift and visitor registration,btohqsg
All those buildings cp very expensive😂,btohqsg
Just now those take $80+ one wasted,btohqsg
