"im not quite sure ""laziness"" can summarise the delay of a multi-million dollar project",btohqsg
"let's chalk it up to ""laziness""",btohqsg
Either that or overworked+lack of manpower,btohqsg
Civil Engineering is always a fucking pain,btohqsg
overworked and lack of manpower has been the summary of the singapore construction industry since  forever,btohqsg
Even with planning it is unpredictable one,btohqsg
Not to mention the earth itself is unpredictable,btohqsg
and I will say that I talked to the JRL upper management + some LTA ppl before,btohqsg
The prefabricated parts and building is quite easy is just when u lay the foundation what happens if u found granite in that mound,btohqsg
There's always not enough manpower in manual labor jobs/industries,btohqsg
Oh yea it's not these people that are lazy  LTA is very efficient it's the contractors,btohqsg

My classmate told me he knew a rp intern that went for a 1 yr internship at PUB and said she literally went there to drink kopi for the whole year at pub prob a job with data involved,btohqsg
maybe cause poly intern can't do much,btohqsg
All gov sectors looking for degree+,btohqsg
Poly U assigned to Technician level,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooreh remember the intern RP story I told u?,btohqsg
My supervisor is a poly graduate and he has significantly more to do and is assigned to more things as expected but the job scope is very simillar,btohqsg
I mean as well I'm paid $30+ a day..I don't want to be doing the same task people that get paid $100+ a day do,btohqsg
I mean from what I can see I'm assigned to just jrl  my supervisor is assigned to jrl  dtl cl and tel...so his salary as expected is prob 3x more than mine since he is assigned 3x more projects,btohqsg
3x more than me is like $3k a month,btohqsg
that's damn low for a sup,btohqsg
I think in the hierarchy here  a sup is not very high,btohqsg
What is this LTA job about?,btohqsg
