top sch w shit score or worst sch w bettter score,btohqsg
Tdy education minister come my sch haha,btohqsg
poly is a good school too,btohqsg
usually with a shit score u cant go to a good sch?,btohqsg
Definitely top school with garbage score,btohqsg
nono what if u got into a good sch,btohqsg
if its the same basis aka like alevels  then the latter,btohqsg
but i do believe there will be interviews and other things,btohqsg
Because then you can network with a ton of top students,btohqsg
so they hv to consider other factors like how the person is  their traits etc,btohqsg
but what if the student from the worst sch has attachments from good company,btohqsg
I feel like people make more connections in the atas schs. Maybe outdated but Raffles medical grp is a company set up by rafflesians,btohqsg
and students from top sch doesnt have,btohqsg
they js feel bad for jc students having to study mostly useless things ðŸ’€ðŸ’€/lh,btohqsg
The whole team came from NP BA,btohqsg
then Ye they would have an advantage,btohqsg
I think the connections are the biggest adv but that's more of the raffles hc and acs crowd imo,btohqsg
Im saying those cuz my bestfriend is from ite and he has btr intern companies then me,btohqsg
His name is literally on the pillar on the first floor of block 72,btohqsg
like i said other factors come into play,btohqsg
Wait which school are you from?,btohqsg
other factors more important than school,btohqsg
the successor course of np ba,btohqsg
Marketing is the most popular specialisation in there,btohqsg
its true that more people wanna go poly now,btohqsg
my senior went to human capital,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the one Iâ€™ve heard the least about,btohqsg
but thats because i think they know what they wanna pursue,btohqsg
i went to jc cuz i didnt know what i wanted to do with my life,btohqsg
Btw which one of the PLP modules are you going for??,btohqsg
theres this article that said 50% of students pick poly over jc despite being able to qualify for both,btohqsg
I chose the entrepreneurship modules for everything,btohqsg
gg to my jc was my biggest regret ngl,btohqsg
wait then why didnt u js go npbs,btohqsg
i almost wanted to transfer to poly,btohqsg
I sometimes consider that as well,btohqsg
i only realised what i wanted to do in the middle of j1,btohqsg
Itâ€™s another type of terrible here,btohqsg
But the grass is always greener on the other side ig,btohqsg
You have to worry about politics instead of only grades,btohqsg
now im having kinda clearer picture of what career i wanna pursue,btohqsg
just dont make the wrong decision then end up regretting,btohqsg
for the epic uni admission its a sacrifice,btohqsg
Idw go business sch thou haha,btohqsg
i thinking of transferring course too so,btohqsg
gg to my jc was big regret but i dont regret not transferring out,btohqsg
every sch got toxic sides imo,btohqsg
Any competitive course will have politics,btohqsg
Unless if you go to like,btohqsg
Starting over is a pain after all,btohqsg
