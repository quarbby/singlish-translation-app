LoL forget it....big brand doesn't mean no rogue agent,btohqsg
Anyone knows whats the dark grey stains which tends to appear under the side mirrors  car logos  door handles of car  especially white car.Any method to clean these stains off the car?Appears like water dripping marks,btohqsg
Wipe will do  dust dirt accumulated in the joints  rain sunny a few times will kena.,btohqsg
Let me go take some photos and share,btohqsg
Tried wiping but seems like it became permanent? Any wash liquid is able to resolve this mark?,btohqsg
can try use clay bar to rub off when washing your car  or use those waterless wash spray try polish off,btohqsg
Try APC   if it doesn't work ull need to polish. Clay only when needed cause It will scratch and Marr the paint.,btohqsg
Just normal wax will get rid of it. Very obvious on white coloured paintwork.,btohqsg
Cannot avoid. Especially after rain. Those are dirty trapped in the gaps. When it rains  it flushes down on the paintwork.,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips. Will try out each of them,btohqsg
Apc is a brand of cleaning solution?,btohqsg
So what we shd do is to wipe off immediately after we experienced rain?,btohqsg
Yes i saw alot of white coloured cars having alot of these ugly drooling stains ...my goodness,btohqsg
cant really prevent but you can do a ceramic coating to minimise the stains  weekly washes shld be done too. For now if you cant wash it off  just go and do a polish and ceramic coat,btohqsg
Water marks drying and baking onto paint under sun over timeâ€¦.,btohqsg
no problem! As a car enthusiast with OCD  always nice to see people take good care of their cars!,btohqsg
Mr Xun is very helpful and has provided me some very helpful life tips too.,btohqsg
Yes. But too many areas to wipe. Once dried  normal shampoo can't remove them. Need to apply wax and wipe off. Just get those cheap wax will do the job.,btohqsg
All purpose cleaner. Got a few brands for car,btohqsg
How long does ceramic coating last on the averge?,btohqsg
If your car is always parked under the weather. Some lasts only few months. Can't prevent watermarks.,btohqsg
really depends from brand to brand  i go for the mid tier ones so about 9mths under minimal care.Minimal care = often left under the sun and driving on roads w lots of debris,btohqsg
sometimes the cheaper ones last 3 months and wear out,btohqsg
I've got bad experience with some. Gave up. Now just kaki DIY.,btohqsg
Before sign up  say can prevent watermarks. After job done  found watermarks after 2 months  went back to ask them  they act gangster.,btohqsg
aiyoo haha  no worries  clay+ ceramic coat can do at home if you want,btohqsg
a lot of low quality job... I paid 200+ for coating after 1 year of sun and rain still have beading,btohqsg
those good one deserve continued patronage,btohqsg
I use Sonax Brilliant Shine. Happy with it.,btohqsg
yep thats a very good brand haha,btohqsg
"i dare not say any brand ltr kena yellow card for ""promoting""ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ« ðŸ« ",btohqsg
Apply and wipe. Dun even need to buff.,btohqsg
must know how to apply lor  i have seen ppl mess the coat beforeðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So simple also can mess ar,btohqsg
i look at the car why half the car beading the other half not beadingðŸ« ðŸ« ,btohqsg
Haha there is ceramic and there is ceramic. how you prep and apply also matters. Donâ€™t forget the maintenance part too after application eg shampoo compatibility.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s definitely not a magic pill so you need to be mindful of care of it so it cares for your car longer in a way,btohqsg
there is petrol kiosk ceramic then there is real ceramic,btohqsg
Definitely need to find a good place and also take care of it,btohqsg
Like those hairstyle demos in the mall,btohqsg
Do half the hair  then say pay extra for the rest lol,btohqsg
And it doesnâ€™t stop at the body ahâ€¦ there is windscreen  and rim ceramic coats too,btohqsg
If you want to go further  some even PPF their headlamps to protect it from chips etc,btohqsg
Different owners approach this to different extents soâ€¦ just need to figure out how much money  love and time you want to put into this ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
I'm using Graphene Coating.Think got 3 coat.Cannot go petrol kiosk car wash. They use sponge. ðŸ˜…Only mint cloth.Weekly water wax.I Let carpark uncle wash 4x / weak. They use cloth.,btohqsg
There's some who detail the car and do ceramic coating and then put on ppf over that and switch out every 2 years to make sure the ppf stays clear,btohqsg
I do actually. Reason is not so much only the PPF  but the adhesiveâ€¦,btohqsg
Wait.. only headlamp ah.. not the body.,btohqsg
Yeah the adhesive can damage the headlamp glass and stay on  especially in the weather we have here,btohqsg
Headlamp is one key area that many forget to protect and it hurts them a lot when they need to replace the whole unit if the glass itself cannot be replaced,btohqsg
