Tackling Paper 1 Editing_Student Copy .pdf,btohqsg
anyone else editing is quite strong? i normally get 7-10 marks for practices,btohqsg
hi to all those taking o’s yea atb & jy ! pls rmb to take care of urselves oso,btohqsg
My editing is shit HAHA but o lvl editing still can make it,btohqsg
Ok idk if its just me but when I read theediting passage out loud it's easier to spot mistakes,btohqsg
I mean mentally not out loud,btohqsg
it's hit or miss for me but if u find out  lmk too!!,btohqsg
Guess I'll just send it to the grp,btohqsg
Moment I get home promise I'll work on it,btohqsg
Guys if I get a B3 for math p1,btohqsg
How much more to A1 for p2,btohqsg
Isn't the emath curve super high,btohqsg
Uhm  can u D7 at least?,btohqsg
I give u gun  may u do the honor of eliminating an opponent(me) HAHA jokes,btohqsg
theres no such thing as bell curve,btohqsg
Yes my p1 I just checked shud be around 49-51,btohqsg
U could tell that to the no. of students gettig 80+ in past years to get A2-B3,btohqsg
if like too many people do well   then like for example a1 can be higher to become 81%,btohqsg
could be 90+ as well lmfao,btohqsg
if too many ppl do terrible then like a1 can become like 70%,btohqsg
That is technically bellcurve  in another format,btohqsg
The minimum cut off score to get each grade is more or less determined,btohqsg
Just that it changes a bit every yr for A1/A2,btohqsg
B3 and below usually dont change much,btohqsg
It is possible to make a comeback for paper 2,btohqsg
Any seniors who did crap for paaper 1   but manage to comeback for p2?,btohqsg
What type of passing is not 50% omg,btohqsg
Im quite sure overall % to get C6 for english is lower than 50%,btohqsg
My friend did 2 yrs ago when I was 16  lost contact but she manage to pass math overall after failing P1,btohqsg
But whether 50% on the dot or lower depends on subject,btohqsg
My math Cher said before it’s possible,btohqsg
Ye u need to compensate ur mistakes in p1,btohqsg
So if i manage to pass one paper i could still fail overall,btohqsg
Ofc but if you do well in one  you'll most likely be fine in the other.,btohqsg
Emath A1 is almost close to 90% overallA2 probably 80% overall and above,btohqsg
How do I calculate my grade btw  45/80,btohqsg
U cant u need combine with p2,btohqsg
Both out of 80 so can 50/50,btohqsg
My fren scored 70+% for emath,btohqsg
Who damn suey 97% for alot of people,btohqsg
Whoever tell u 97% is joking,btohqsg
Im sure if u hit 91%,btohqsg
Who 100% u come out now I summon u,btohqsg
Yeah 90+is alr like... god level,btohqsg
No wonder u went to pasir ris jc,btohqsg
He's admin guys he speaks the truth,btohqsg
Depends on year also...2018 was one of the most difficult years for E Math...I got friends claiming they got as low as 80+  still A1,btohqsg
Like practical planning... the examiners have to solve,btohqsg
To be fair  thats a better jc than some of the elite jcs,btohqsg
