Double-click the respective Network Controller or Adapter  select the Driver tab  and then select Disable Device.In the warning box  select Yes.Then restart the network controller by selecting Enable Device.Restart your Surface by selecting Start > Power > Restart  or if you have updates pending  select Update and restart.,btohqsg
