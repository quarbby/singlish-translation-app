text,group
is rp better or ite better,btohqsg
It was made for the FYP surveys,btohqsg
But then got 1 person go reply that email and auto set to reply all,btohqsg
Then from then on its like humans discovering fire,btohqsg
i think rp would be a great school for some good olʼ laughter,btohqsg
itʼs like the students who go there do so for their comedic shit,btohqsg
how the hell do you get your email hacked,btohqsg
Yes but it got caught in my spam,btohqsg
if you want to hack an account  why not hack a bank account  sounds more smart,btohqsg
The email system has a all function,btohqsg
the reply was for this email lol,btohqsg
that javier ng person just got blasted,btohqsg
hope heʼs having a good time right now,btohqsg
Ie when u write an email to that it send that reply to all the students,btohqsg
oh yea btw this is the amt of emails ive accumulated over the last 3 yrs,btohqsg
this acc is strictly for rp lol...so many useless emails,btohqsg
I missed RP.. lmao the only one whereby u can miss half the classes and still fulfil attendance requirements,btohqsg
what do you even get out of hacking an email? making you look like a fool,btohqsg
my ite email is full of idk what,btohqsg
i bet itʼs not as shameful as whatever@Ryannnnnnnnnnis getting in his,btohqsg
huh then where you go now,btohqsg
But if I didn't I am supposed to be in the current graduate batch,btohqsg
mine is full of straits time,btohqsg
that was 2 yrs ago..they introduced measures in the last yr or so that prevents that from happening,btohqsg
given the kind of school youʼre in  i doubt people wont try to manoeuvre their way around it to continue these kinds of stuff,btohqsg
from rp dropout to ntu  thats a success story in anybody books,btohqsg
You cant be a student of RP and NTU unfortunately,btohqsg
yea had a friend dropout to go ns,btohqsg
then come back to take private uni,btohqsg
at least itʼs something educational and not just full blown nonsense,btohqsg
unlike whatever is going on in rp,btohqsg
RP very common for MDIS and SIM,btohqsg
But since I from SAS if u cmi for Local Uni its MDIS and PSB,btohqsg
Yeah. SIM is considering the more well-known one cuz of SUSS and that mess of what is a local uni and private uni.. back then there was a SIM uni that had government funding lmao,btohqsg
what the hell are those 3 acronyms,btohqsg
School of Applied Science in RPMDIS and PSB is private uni providers,btohqsg
i saw the poly gpa for mdis b4. 2.0+ for science can alr,btohqsg
i thought you were tryna say POSB bank,btohqsg
but the price i cnnt afford,btohqsg
2.0 for admission 2.5 to at least get credit exemption,btohqsg
Like lmao its a low bar,btohqsg
SAP.. from a tree like tree sap,btohqsg
U should have seen my mentors face when I tried to ask her for a letter of recommendation for ABA,btohqsg
talking about comedic..recently at my work  co worker was on leave because the spf held her back for a case of the money being stolen on a plane in sg case,btohqsg
thats the results i hope i get for my promos,btohqsg
i thought u are in rp as a student,btohqsg
Ohffserrr OK Uni Admissions for Local Unis have something called Aptitude Based Admissions,btohqsg
during orientation they already said that,btohqsg
yeah that one. using your holistic stuff instead of academic stuff,btohqsg
what kind of unis are those,btohqsg
RP got allergy to giving students good GPA,btohqsg
They aren't rlly unis like private unis we call em but they are basically just a building,btohqsg
didnt you say that rpʼs system is rigged,btohqsg
imagine if you were in rp,btohqsg
Yeah if u get above 2.5 u can get credit exemptions,btohqsg
but seriously why are their cut offs so low,btohqsg
Which means like u study only for 1- 1.5 years,btohqsg
i feel like even some ite courses have better cut offs than theirs,btohqsg
this is MDIS which is priv uni,btohqsg
^ again it ain't that bad ngl,btohqsg
i must be a billionaire to afford it,btohqsg
It's just private u don't get the uni experience plus the same recognition,btohqsg
I mean if the GPA cmi u probably get into work immediately and don't really have a choice either ways,btohqsg
like this course for example. better than rpʼs cut offs,btohqsg
Yeah they do. But at the end of the day RPs courses are accepted as diploma,btohqsg
While ITEs Hnitec is not. Those numbers are there reflecting that nature lor,btohqsg
ya and ite is js a cert,btohqsg
well itʼs a shortened version of my government name,btohqsg
Its not against the rules if they dox themselves,btohqsg
oh youre in uni currently? what course?,btohqsg
cross out covid and put china instead,btohqsg
im keeping the money for golf,btohqsg
Isn't trump in like the edge of bankruptcy,btohqsg
sg closing all the public golf courses alr,btohqsg
Yeah and they found out he Committed tax fraud,btohqsg
*insert donald trump pensive face gif,btohqsg
I guess we are suck with Wii Golf,btohqsg
and he is still eligible to run for presidency,btohqsg
its all stored in the swiss bank,btohqsg
Yeah he is.. u see eligible even if u are in jail lol,btohqsg
rp has a intake of 4x more than all 3 ite's combined.rp has a student population of 9x more than all 3 ite's combined,btohqsg
If the bunny is the emperor then whats the hamster,btohqsg
Yeah engi is always the massive intake,btohqsg
That's why I say u BME technically the competition like GPA requirements are not as strict,btohqsg
so rp is the dumping ground of all polys,btohqsg
yea..so rp increase their cutoff..ite gonna be overfilled,btohqsg
thats why they have many students,btohqsg
btw this figure will show you,btohqsg
the hamster is the royal advisor... Advising the bunny to ask for more treats 😼😼,btohqsg
unless u tell me u fked up so badly tht u get thrown to ite,btohqsg
it seems the govt stopped funding Nie,btohqsg
i hope you are studying hard@Ryannnnnnnnnn,btohqsg
I mean for engineering... u need a good grade in maths,btohqsg
btw did i tell yall the hamster lore like why i bought it,btohqsg
not very nice to say that,btohqsg
im in my intern now  cant study much anymore,btohqsg
maybe ite students are just better at hands on learning...,btohqsg
Hamsters are just a fancy rat. Convince me otherwise,btohqsg
rp is also a dumping ground fr,btohqsg
hope you are making the most of your internship to explore job stuff,btohqsg
Ite and RP is a dumping ground no matter what,btohqsg
i heard of ppl not even getting accepted to ite,btohqsg
U can say the same for uni lmao,btohqsg
yeah all those stories on reddit,btohqsg
if u cant even qualify for rp,btohqsg
U climb up one step and u have ppl saying NTU is a dumping ground for NUS,btohqsg
im like how tf u cnnt get accepted in ite,btohqsg
Which I mean yeah there is truth to that,btohqsg
okay my friends call hc a dumping ground for ri 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Yeah so everything is relative lmao,btohqsg
mustve actually gotten raw 54  since the lowest cop for any ite course (according to jae booklet) is like 40 r4,btohqsg
NUS is a dumping ground for Ivy rejects,btohqsg
not exp the one i saw on reddit was a NA student,btohqsg
i mean on the jae booklet it even says the requirements are 1-8  so like A1-E8,btohqsg
how tf u get raw 54,btohqsg
Actual it depends the aggregate doesn't paint the full picture lmao,btohqsg
like that time someone said that the lowest for psle was 40 or something,btohqsg
Some get F9 for English or any maths and sci. Auto cannot qualify for poly,btohqsg
are there ppl who can go poly but chose ite after olvls,btohqsg
how is the NA aggregate counted? like what format? what is the max and minimum cop?,btohqsg
Minimum subject entry requirements almost all polys require either a c6 or d7 for your English Maths and Science,btohqsg
ite entry requirements and NT points is diff,btohqsg
meanwhile ours is language 1 relevant 4/5,btohqsg
Got especially if the poly COP is high for their desired course,btohqsg
very few ppl ever want to go rp..if they can help it they wont,btohqsg
I had many when I was in ITE under applied sci,btohqsg
rather go ite than rp..cause at least got chance at other poly's,btohqsg
ite is 4 best subjsNT is EMB1,btohqsg
Cuz the COP for all the applied science courses are at least <20,btohqsg
you go rp..you are sucked to rp,btohqsg
what kind of subjects are offered in NT?,btohqsg
dang you really hate your school huh,btohqsg
not hate..its been a fun school,btohqsg
in sp and np itʼs a single digit r4 course too,btohqsg
U can go seabs website and check it out but the general ones lor,btohqsg
NA and NT have smaller amt of offered subjects,btohqsg
Simply cuz not as much demand,btohqsg
how could i have forgotten that google exists,btohqsg
el math general sci mt computer applications ss(non examinable) and a choice of dnt nfs art music ebs(elements of business skills),btohqsg
but i think now diff alr,btohqsg
weʼre just talking about express NA NT streaming things. how their aggregate are counted. and this@Ryannnnnnnnnnjust loves talking about the funny shit in rp,btohqsg
because theres no way they would teach you triple pure science like o levels lol,btohqsg
the nt students in my school were shortchanged,btohqsg
i somehow have a pic of the tb in my phone. gimme awhile,btohqsg
Just the thought of it made me laugh,btohqsg
bro how u get all this data one,btohqsg
ooo sure iʼd like to see,btohqsg
NTs direct pathway is to Nitec and maybe Hnitec,btohqsg
Idk about the new reformed ite system lmao but back in my day was just nitec,btohqsg
now got 3yr hn courses alr,btohqsg
wait are you in nitec or higher nitec currently?,btohqsg
Yeah which is why I said hnitec lor but the last word I got was that it was still limited to certain courses,btohqsg
"all these are called ""whitepapers""  the kind you everytime hear abt government getting caught with scandals withits documents the govt release to the public for them to analyse/gather info etc",btohqsg
unless u tell me u smart enuf to go 4na after n levels,btohqsg
engineering hospitality and design still got nitec,btohqsg
one information many ite students likely never knew,btohqsg
there used to be 10 diff education locations for ite students,btohqsg
ya last time got alot of ite campus,btohqsg
I knew lol even poly too,btohqsg
There used to be many campus for Poly before the 1990s standardisation,btohqsg
They shifting that for uni now as we can see also with SIT,btohqsg
https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/about-us/education-statistics-digest-2023.pdfpeople wanted transparency  so they had to give people what they want,btohqsg
"""oh u malay means u dumb u chinese means u smart""",btohqsg
but that logic doesn't hold for whether someone passes a math exam,btohqsg
this trend is similar to percentage of people from each ethnicity that goes to uni,btohqsg
a lot of malay families (and this is also from their own words) encourage their kids to work asap like not bother with uni,btohqsg
the perception on education and work is different,btohqsg
like for two malay friends i made in uni  both of them are the only person going uni in their families with like 4 siblings,btohqsg
their parents want them to work asap and provide for the fam,btohqsg
"instead of ""wasting"" money on a degree",btohqsg
end up both those friends self fund themselves for uni,btohqsg
i mean they have mendaki tho so they didn't pay for uni,btohqsg
but in terms of daily expenditure they settle themselves,btohqsg
the two malay friends  one of them is the going Germany for masters one,btohqsg
one of them now interning overseas then going to work at UN potentially,btohqsg
"society sees it as ""malay go void deck play guitar football etc  chinese go for tution  enrichement classas blah blah blah"" not tryna be racist but is the cold hard truth ig",btohqsg
like i won't deny there's a level of prejudice and preferential treatment that pushes this trend further but a lot of it is def the culture,btohqsg
Lmao its been 4 years since he took that mod and he's still salty about that,btohqsg
it's almost ironic bc those malay friends of mine got pressured to just work when they wanted to study to the point where they now p much separate their lives from the fam alr,btohqsg
Wait till u see the gender statistics page,btohqsg
He say getting job very hard he complain non stop that he applied for hundreds,btohqsg
it's like the opposite of what a lot of us experience lol,btohqsg
Lmao they don't share race statistics for individual institutions for a reason,btohqsg
U just explained 90% of the replies,btohqsg
And he didn't intern for those big cooperations,btohqsg
Bro has a proficiency in yapplogy,btohqsg
Nothing  but if we’re speaking on a deeper level socio-economic factors influenced by ethnicity do affect academics to some extent,btohqsg
Accepted Entry QualificationsGeneral Entrance Requirements (GER) are:At least 17 years or older by 30 November in the year of registration with UOLAt least equivalent to B4 grade for Mathematics at GCE ‘O’ Level OR pass Numerical Maths module in the bridging programme at SIMProvide proof of competence in English acceptable to the University  such as a pass (Grade C6 and above) in the GCE ‘O’ Level English Language ExaminationPLUS one of the following:Possess diploma awarded by SIM or a polytechnic in Singapore (or its equivalent) ORTwo approved GCE ‘A’ or H2 level subjects and three approved GCE ‘O’ level subjects (at not less than grade C) ORThree approved GCE ‘A’ or H2 level subjects and one approved GCE ‘O’ level subject (at not less than grade C) ORThree H2 passes provided that at least grades D E E ORTwo H2 and two H1 passes; all are in non-overlapping subjects  ORfrom website,btohqsg
There's also stats for sex enrolment for each uni,btohqsg
Their diploma is a foundational program in all but name,btohqsg
Yala but I know a few of my friends from NA and NT don't have that privilege,btohqsg
Which is why Olevels is so important lmao retrospectively,btohqsg
The degrees yes to an extent,btohqsg
ok is there an issue with this,btohqsg
no prizes for guessing the malaysian state,btohqsg
You can’t demand a higher pay that’s the thing,btohqsg
when skinkie pwn own sinkie...malaysia also cant say anything alr,btohqsg
i fr did nth for my holidays bruh,btohqsg

Imagine..both the govt of malaysia and singapore get caught up in your fetish,btohqsg
that happened to a couple 11 yrs ago,btohqsg
was that the tammy or watever?,btohqsg
nope it was about a malaysian couple that started a sex blog..it got widespread attention and came into the eyes of the malaysian govt..the malaysian govt however gave singapore the authority to charge the couple instead because the guy was a NUS law student,btohqsg
Bruh i binge watched this guy,btohqsg
malaysia was waiting on singapore to charge the couple..before they would add charges on them,btohqsg
under the malaysian telecomunications and multimedia act,btohqsg
not rly like their hurting ppl tho,btohqsg
unlike the what wife swapping one,btohqsg
ye ig cant argue against the law,btohqsg
he citizen of what country sia?,btohqsg
malaysian  they revoked his malaysian passport,btohqsg
he is now wanted by interpol,btohqsg
his ex-girlfriend vivian was fined 5k in 2018 by a malaysian court,btohqsg
no like wat is his citizenship now?,btohqsg
ya sia go to the jungle be like mowgli,btohqsg
he sought asylum in the US,btohqsg
so now he is currently in the US,btohqsg
he is now in the adult entertainment industry in the US,btohqsg
start 4 years early but hentak pay for the next 50,btohqsg
us seeking asylum  now he is creating a life there,btohqsg
US rly accept any1 for asylum,btohqsg
that's why my friend now has a degree  doesn't contact her fam  and is fucking off to germany for masters,btohqsg
reminds me of one guy names amos yee,btohqsg
my (chi) friend signed on and instantly bought a car,btohqsg
Wait wait what is the good pw idea,btohqsg

I wont starve if i spend 16 dollar,btohqsg
where are you finding these cynical shit,btohqsg
the internet is your best friend,btohqsg
i feel like its a bit dumb to spend 16 sgd on a chair for a plushie but it made me happy so ehh,btohqsg
but why are you specifically finding these weird shit,btohqsg
do you know the dave rasif story,btohqsg
malaysians have been known to replicate known singaporean cars and commit offences in both malaysia and singapore where the offences goes back to the actual owner,btohqsg
didnt he say hes sec 3 earlier,btohqsg

yeah he seems to have a great deal of experience,btohqsg
my statistics is only a small subset of the cohort  so you are probably right,btohqsg
students should seek help when they really need  be it through tuition or through tele study group,btohqsg

would be weird to say ord lah,btohqsg
I’ve never heard loh much tbh,btohqsg
the incident was so stupid after i read the reports,btohqsg
the reason why the collision even happened was due to the inexperience of the rsn officers commanding the vessel,btohqsg
if I dodge ns I can’t enter Singapore right?,btohqsg
he in the chem lab making explosives,btohqsg
3 rsn sailors paid with their life for that mistake,btohqsg
Unless you’re PES F or smth,btohqsg
Not rlly you can but you may get caught  or give up citizenship and not get caught,btohqsg
There’s also like “tiered” prison time depending on your age  I also think you still need to serve regardless,btohqsg

I think I’m gonna go for OCS or SCS or wtv,btohqsg
"i mean there are plenty of ppl that will willingly say ""i dont need to ever come back singapore""",btohqsg
unless the us doesn’t want him anymore,btohqsg
I think we also don’t want him lol,btohqsg
Isn’t he getting deported aft he serves prison,btohqsg
And I think he didn’t even serve NS yet lmao,btohqsg
Eh guys random but any JC kids access their Google classroom,btohqsg

sometimes comp work but mobile cmi,btohqsg
Anyone got A for pw got some good ideas I can use,btohqsg
I tried tapping my acc after doing that and it'd kicked me out,btohqsg
When it comes to choosing a good Personal Project (PW) idea for A-levels  consider selecting a topic that aligns with your interests  allows for in-depth exploration  and showcases your skills and knowledge. Here are some potential PW ideas across different subjects:1.STEM (Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics):   - Design and construct a small-scale renewable energy system  such as a solar-powered charger or a wind turbine.- Investigate the impact of various factors on plant growth  such as different types of soil  light exposure  or watering schedules.2.Social Sciences:   - Conduct a sociological study on the effects of social media on mental health among teenagers.- Analyze the correlation between socioeconomic status and academic achievement in your local community.3.Humanities:   - Create a historical documentary exploring a significant event or period in your country's history.- Write and perform a dramatic monologue from the perspective of a character in a classic novel  exploring themes and character motivations.4.Languages:   - Produce a series of short stories or poems in a foreign language  focusing on cultural themes or personal experiences.- Create a language-learning app or website aimed at helping beginners grasp basic vocabulary and grammar rules.5.Arts:   - Develop a portfolio of artwork exploring a specific theme or concept  such as identity  environmentalism  or urban landscapes.- Choreograph and perform a dance piece that communicates a message or tells a story related to a social or cultural issue.6.Business and Economics:- Conduct a market research study to identify consumer preferences and trends in a specific industry.   - Develop a business plan for a socially responsible enterprise  addressing environmental sustainability and community impact.7.Health and Medicine:- Investigate the efficacy of various mindfulness techniques in reducing stress and anxiety levels among students.   - Design and conduct an experiment to analyze the effects of different diets on physical health and well-being.Remember to choose a topic that you are passionate about and that allows for meaningful exploration and analysis. Additionally  ensure that your PW idea aligns with the requirements and guidelines set by your school or exam board.,btohqsg
There I done it for you,btohqsg
This is the last batch afaik,btohqsg
i tot pass/fail starts this yr,btohqsg
I mean still need to do ig.. Idk i didnt do it. Private Candidate perks,btohqsg
Dont have to report PW grades if you don't have it... Big brain time,btohqsg
But but here's the thing   now or rather at least here in MI  normally we take PW in y2 rite so if your PW fail in y2  then you'll have to take it in y3 just to pass it( that's assuming you'll make it to y3 otherwise idk what happens if u retain la tbf) and you'll be taking it ALONE....individually...no group or anything ... Also if you were to fail   it'll pop up as a black dash in your results slip which won't look nice,btohqsg
y3 is when we take GP along w 3 H2s sooo yea,btohqsg
I mean that's the issue of being only 1 of 209 ppl,btohqsg
There's only 209 or about 8 classes in MI for PU3 and that's about it,btohqsg
MI is often seen as a dumping ground for those who cmi for JC but still want that system,btohqsg
Eh rlly lol idk that much stats tbf,btohqsg
Yeah I mean compared to the 12k+ ppl taking Alevels in JC2,btohqsg
Well Matcha said that with the revised PW syllabus it’s also the same. Retaking is still done individually and now it’s even easier to pass,btohqsg
Oh but the issue is that the system would only be indiscriminate by 2028 or 2027,btohqsg
huh what. do grp proj alone??? damn,btohqsg
There's a 1 year grace period whereby the previous computation should be and would be used,btohqsg
I sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier. How will my UAS be computed if I applyfor admission to the AUs in AY2026 or later?For AU admission in AY2026 and AY2027For applicants who sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier  their PW  as well as H1 andH2 content-based subject grades will be taken into consideration for UAS computation  as percurrent practice. Applicants who offered H2 KI can use it in lieu of H1 GP and the H1 content-basedsubject in UAS computation. Their UAS will be computed on the existing 90-point scale andproportionately weighted to the revised 70-point scale.From AY2028 AU admissionsRegardless of the year of GCE A-Level examination  applicants’ UAS will be computed using therevised 70-point scale.The PW grade will not be considered in the UAS computation from AY2028. An applicant would beconsidered to have met the requirement for AU admission if he/she presents a Pass grade in PW. If anapplicant had previously offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP)  the H2KI grade will be considered as the H1 GP grade in the revised UAS computation from AY2028.,btohqsg
So only 2028 then they ignore PW grade assuming u have a PW grade.,btohqsg
I thought it was 2026? Unless you’re referring to people who were under the old system,btohqsg
But the guy who was asking for help asked this year. And 2024 is when the new pw syllabus starts,btohqsg
Yeah ppl under the old system which is what the MI would be assuming a retake for PW in PU3,btohqsg
Oh damn that guy is from MI?,btohqsg
Idk@mersculaI am just following the logic of him,btohqsg
Oh ok I know atarax is from MI,btohqsg
I referring to this guy who asked,btohqsg
Like if he’s J1 now why bother,btohqsg
True ig but he still need to do it idk,btohqsg
Hais. I was hoping I could rely on the 70rp system in 2026,btohqsg
But at least from 2028 onwards students under the old system don’t need to worry,btohqsg
Yeah that's why i even had that on file,btohqsg
Walao I in hall now sia,btohqsg
Like whether a topic is good or not doesn’t matter lol anything that’s passable will pass,btohqsg
So idk why he wants to fret over it,btohqsg
What u in the atas halls isit,btohqsg
U in North Hill? Cmon wheres the clue,btohqsg
man uk how last year's batch '23 would be taking As under the new system...I rmb briefly thst the principal said those( of'22 batch) who retained would still be under the old RP system and not the new one,btohqsg
Yeah basically it only affects the new batch even if they are against it,btohqsg
idk if I'm affected because altho im not a retainee,btohqsg
I only enrolled into MI last yr LOL,btohqsg
cause of me retaking Os twice to take As,btohqsg
Does your PW now have a grade?,btohqsg
I haven't taken my PW yet,btohqsg
Your syllabus code isit the old or new one,btohqsg
Idk I lazy to comment on that,btohqsg
I rmb marking against my name and I did checked properly,btohqsg
it should be under new syllabus,btohqsg
Then most likely u in the new one with no PW grade lo,btohqsg
By not commenting we all are smart so we should just not comment,btohqsg
In short unless u wait until 2028 u are in the 90 RP system,btohqsg
Can I assume you're one of the ancient ones too,btohqsg
it's either grad or almost grad or finding job rn,btohqsg
cause you've literally popped up from nowhere,btohqsg
like disc from what I've read,btohqsg
i'm still the super ancient one after junwei,btohqsg
In NTU I can tell u SOH la.. cuz its tiny idw to be doxxed,btohqsg
I still can't believe how kuro manage to make u feel young,btohqsg
LOL bc he has mega boomer vibes,btohqsg
It was joever the moment he took out those flyers,btohqsg
i think i've met one person from every course in soh,btohqsg
i gave up on not doxxing myself long time ago,btohqsg
Not to worry i can help u find si yan,btohqsg
yea someone from my sec sch went into that lol,btohqsg
Thats like Journey to the West Si Yan,btohqsg
i can help you find si yan as well,btohqsg
neither of you know where my office is,btohqsg
"If uk be sure to put a post it on the table indicating "" I know where u live""",btohqsg
Can I schedule a consult be like:,btohqsg
wah fuck reminds me this friday i need to go ntu early to invigilate some midterm,btohqsg
i'll pretend to be his student,btohqsg
all jokes aside i dont even remember who your prof is,btohqsg
Anyone got his DR NTU page?,btohqsg
i heard csa gave yall 10 marks for showing up LOL,btohqsg
nah it was just a placeholder,btohqsg
like if you get less than 10 marks (gonna be me) he's gonna change the mark,btohqsg
damn my year he just let the 1/30 remain as that,btohqsg
tbh if your assignments ok  should still be fine? comes down to finals,btohqsg
what do u think the hardest course was during your degree?,btohqsg
Help Iestin! This ain't like u,btohqsg
my motivation in ntu became from graduate with 2nd upper  to graduate with 2nd lower  and then now i just wanna get out already i dont care about my gpa,btohqsg
It's as if you're being eaten alive,btohqsg
unfortunately im not like any of those people who are able to develop an intrinsic motivation to study physics :(,btohqsg
wah if in terms of scoring it's complex methods (the one iestin is taking) but the one that mind fucked me was quantum mechanics II lol,btohqsg
electromagnetism i hear is like that too at times but i got it during covid sem so never finished,btohqsg
I am still procrastinating on my essays tbh,btohqsg
i think qm ii was hard for me bc qm i was during covid also and i lacked the fundamentals,btohqsg
but u taking it as a phd topic tho,btohqsg
I mean looking back do u feel a sense of inferiority still somewhat or wot,btohqsg
yea now i have to use it a lot but my weaker fundamentals show at times,btohqsg
so it's like doing phd stuff while brushing up on that where i can,btohqsg
wait is your phd advisor gu mile,btohqsg
"isit weird to look back now and think ""how did i not get this topic""",btohqsg
im the kind of person who cant find the motivation to study until the very last second (aka the day before the test),btohqsg
coz i certainly did when i look at my poly notes and i wonder how did i not know this stuff,btohqsg
I prefer to clear things ASAP but I honestly find myself hitting a creativity and inferiority block,btohqsg
ok the higher level undergrad stuff sometimes still takes me a while but it's less confusing bc i apply it more now,btohqsg
nah i'm under koh teck seng. rainer is experimental  i do theory,btohqsg
Honestly I have no idea and feel alone and everyone's better than me ngl,btohqsg
how much while is a while for u..,btohqsg
oh ok i was just going down the list of the nanyang quantum hub people LMAO,btohqsg
i mean the hard part is translating the textbook to what i'm doing now,btohqsg
Aye so there's this satisfaction ah,btohqsg
oh you'll get imposter syndrome a LOT in uni (if you're anything like me),btohqsg
but like after awhile i cant even keep myself afloat anymore  much less be bothered to think about other people,btohqsg
In retrospect I shouldn't have taken a Level 4000x but meh 😐,btohqsg
also wouldnt a lv 4x mod be locked behind pre requisites,btohqsg
Nope and even if there was I would meet it,btohqsg
SOH ain't super strict on 4ks its just that u get whacked lor,btohqsg
ig bc it's not like hard sciences where you need to know specific math or concepts beforehand,btohqsg
yeah i would assume along these lines,btohqsg
Yeah.. not gonna expose myself but I doing philo as a minor and that's my 4k mod.. its a Philosophy of Science mod tho which is literally hard-ish science,btohqsg
that sounds like a cool mod tho ngl,btohqsg
Enters mod and he covers basic astronomy in one lesson,btohqsg
We are on Celestial mechanics and classical mechanics of Decartes and moving to Newton,btohqsg
wait thats sounds kinda cool to me,btohqsg
Basically all the well known ppl so start from Ptolemy Copernicus Kepler Galileo Decartes and then Now Newton,btohqsg
sounds like all the physics nerds,btohqsg
it's one of the topics in analytical mech,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I stayed it's damn cool but the content is damn dense,btohqsg
wait shit ya i need to do anal mech next sem,btohqsg
one of my fav mods i took tbh,btohqsg
It's like a Philosophy of Science thing tho very much so the evidence issue is kinda central.. like how do they even make and form the mathematical rigour,btohqsg
i will be the witness for that,btohqsg
All the time lmao tbh that's why I prefer to embrace non linear learning and thinking,btohqsg
it's less mindfucking imo bc end of the day it's classical mechanics,btohqsg
i guess its just when u grow older your brain just become more intensed,btohqsg
i'll have you know my mind was fucked already for classical mechanics...,btohqsg
i was literally hoping for a D walking out of that finals,btohqsg
can't be more than qm right,btohqsg
jury aint out yet for qm1,btohqsg
but so far the mid terms was pretty doable,btohqsg
I suspect its a routine thing,btohqsg
lol kuro the poly stuff you showed me...,btohqsg
ok my gripe with a levels is that the questions are easier when i look at it now but there's a lot of concepts that are just taken as fact,btohqsg
in poly Eng maths its just H1 maths i feel,btohqsg
and my brain is not ok with just accepting them lol,btohqsg
so i spend a lot of time digging into the why,btohqsg
ok maybe some topics are harder but,btohqsg
Thing is tho is that the philo part takes another degree just to cover that,btohqsg
Like in retrospect I understand algebra and why they need to work and why those law and rules are there in the first place la,btohqsg
But the actual reasoning behind that requires history also ngl and u gotta see the influence of thought and stuff like those.,btohqsg
not sure ur engineering have anot but for mine we did touch on stats,btohqsg
the intersection between science and philo is more interesting when you look at quantum side lol,btohqsg
like how many times this structure can withstand stress before it fail,btohqsg
when i was teaching my mentee i tried to give more perspective on some of the math,btohqsg
idk if it helped but eh,btohqsg
Oh I intend too assuming I make it through astronomy and mechanics,btohqsg
eh i have a funny question,btohqsg
that's been how i survived uni without doing tutorials,btohqsg
to sign up as a helper for any mod  is there a minimum grade requirement?,btohqsg
