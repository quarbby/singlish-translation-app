For me is always early morning,btohqsg
But idk about posb since I using ocbc,btohqsg
Early morning ah? I jus check. Haven in. üòî,btohqsg
Just check lo. Maybe at night in or what,btohqsg
U using posb/dbs ah? U got ur pay liao?,btohqsg
I changed bank details already. Previously using posb normally Wednesday morning will credit in also.,btohqsg
As in every wed morning ? Or random timing de? Afternoon? Evening ?,btohqsg
Could you show me a screenshot,btohqsg
Wednesday morning. You try wait see tomorrow or Friday lo if dont have try asking Cs?,btohqsg
You may have accidentally hidden it,btohqsg
But by right if I'm not wrong when you cashout it says will receive money by 7days or working days. Plus you cashout before the cut off date which is Sunday so you should receive already mah,btohqsg
Mine looks like this  gotta wait for nicegram to update haha,btohqsg
In case it said failed to cashout,btohqsg
Nope  never state failed to cashout,btohqsg
"Actually I find it quite complicated prefer the old group. Now it seems sbit confusing and kind of ""mafan"".",btohqsg
Yea.. sometimes I also thought my app cannot see other messages oso,btohqsg
But I got the hang of it tbh quite quickly,btohqsg
I think it might be better to revert back to how the group was like before  and then set up other groups for other purposes and then pin the link in the main group.,btohqsg
Yea I prefer old one too,btohqsg
Could you see the general chat now?,btohqsg
Cannot see  I think it's really just my app,btohqsg
My app also lag til like the conputer i used 20 years ago,btohqsg
Sorry to trouble you to screenshot again üôè,btohqsg
General chat cannot be seen liao,btohqsg
Frankly speaking  I prefer the old chat group. It's more simplified and not so confusing. For marketplace  non LLM job request and vehicle rental maybe can create new group and pin all the link in the main group. So for those who are interested can click on the link and join those group.,btohqsg
I'll consider the feedbacküôè I'll take a few days to observe how it goes.,btohqsg
Maybe can consider putting up a poll to get vote as well,btohqsg
