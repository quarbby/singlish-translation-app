This ones can't find any reason to disagree with u.. fully agree 👍,btohqsg
I know some BBs are also TA experts as well. So purposely manufactured a chart for people to read and pull plug during the most crucial time,btohqsg
All I know is... I'll lose chor as usual,btohqsg
I had a brother  his account is damn sharp. Can tell me which one was real and which one was fake. Too bad he retired in Thailand years ago.,btohqsg

Spin off listing what existing LHN share holders benefited?Koh Eco spin off listing existing share holders get nothing,btohqsg
Last few years  I made mainly in HK  why? Because the market there is a lot more transparent.,btohqsg
Furthermore  whatever factors these MMs or BBs are looking there  I am watching it as well,btohqsg

U see  my handphone  can see which brokerage is queuing at which price,btohqsg
Yea. Best is to cut down on carbo esp for dinner .,btohqsg
I believe  if the shareholding structure is strong  no matter how bad the FA  dun anyhow short. When the shareholder structure is weak  I usually do a fast trade if I play,btohqsg
Not that I am saying Koh brother is a conjob. But I usually won't play this kind of cross holding games unless there is a way to raid it,btohqsg
Gd nite🌷.. me🙆🏻 tired😴💤Nice sharing.. let's continue practicing learning tgther🥰,btohqsg
Subsi listed  now subsi's subsi also listed,btohqsg
Trying to chain it up only,btohqsg
Look deeper  is a good way to get fresh money into the company without marginalise the parent or the parent's parent shareholders,btohqsg
But then  if the grandparent structure is weak  got taken out by outsiders  outsiders will hit 1 to get 3,btohqsg
The most disgusting so far I encountered  someone chained up 11 listed companies.  Not thru listing  is cross holdings.,btohqsg
I know msia got this  very famous🙊🙊🙊,btohqsg
Spin off listing parent company Nav and EPS depreciated.Parent share holders get nothing?Koh Eco,btohqsg
Malaysia tat group printing alot of shares  cross holding  right issue  share consol  etc all finance skill played till retailers died😂,btohqsg
One who knows how to market make will be able to create tulip mania out of nothing. One know how to identify gem assets is able to create value. One who understands both will be able to create a successful listed company.,btohqsg
There is also one group  from Indonesia  damn good in playing warrants as well.,btohqsg
So different camps have different skillsets,btohqsg
Sg got this kind of group or not?,btohqsg
Last time they have a company  thought the controlling thinly held. Whoever try to raid them  they will tell u to come and try  they convert warrants and you will be out of the game.,btohqsg

Doubt it will give special dividend,btohqsg
I cut loss Koh Eco after I knew their spin off is dirty game existing share holders get nothing,btohqsg
Sorry to say  a lot of these cross holdings are just trying to make retail guess value. In actual fact  is just pumping share value (not price) to let us have wet dream.,btohqsg
Go into market kena chop only,btohqsg
Go back home sleep better. Less stress,btohqsg
Take the money go holiday sua,btohqsg
If spin off listing you get new listing share ok. If not  then we are stupid  they removed subsidiary for spin off listing then we can get nothing ???Koh Eco con me once,btohqsg
By right should get. But usually spin off  will bump up LHN share price. Once get the subsidiary shares  sell as fast as possible. Because spin off is to leverage on the number of headcounts the parent has to push out subsidiary. Usually the subsi that is doing so so will do that. If the controlling shareholder of the parent holds high percentage  then is a very convenient way to transfer the subsidiary to the controlling shareholder. Controlling shareholder of parent will equal to the controlling shareholder of subsidiary post listing.,btohqsg
Why today LHN so solid green candle?lol  abnormal,btohqsg
