Meaning I won't even get the card even if I apply for it? Or the application would not go through,btohqsg
It's a membership. No membership  no card.,btohqsg
Citi prestige is strictly not waiving annual fee.,btohqsg
Ok. Means I won't get pass the application and won't get the card if I don't pay the annual fee,btohqsg
Application didnt check for AF as far as i know. Once the card is approved  it will show up in citi app. AF will be charged to your card. If you call to waive the fee  they will say no and cancel the card.,btohqsg

Did u guys already got the ocbc 360 interest?,btohqsg
hi  looking for a card that has good base air-mile earnings  but can get approval instantly to use it digitally?any such card?,btohqsg
My experience is they will just offset future payments unless you overpaid for the entire income tax bill,btohqsg
Citi cards can be used right away when approved. Can't rmb how long it will take to approve thou.,btohqsg
Is it worth investing CPF OA amount here?  Any thoughts / comments?,btohqsg
Why not? If you have spare cash from your CPF OA do it. CPF 2.5% AIA 3.38% free 0.88% more 😂,btohqsg
Thanks and completely agree with your opinion.  Just wanted to know if there are other instruments vs this one from AiA and which one is beneficial.,btohqsg
Took me 1-2 business days to get approved and card arrived in within 1 week (applied last month),btohqsg
T-bills will be better for short term 👍🏼 need to review every 3-6months.With interest rates set to fall… e.g. you get 4x 6mths T-bills for nxt 2 years at• 3.7%• 3.2%• 2.7%• 2.2%Average interest rate 2.95% p.a.However  if interest rate were to remain high  T-bills will win. But this is a non-guaranteed,btohqsg
Depends if you want something that’s guaranteed returns and won’t lose money. Then this AIA returns seem decent,btohqsg
what’s the best place to exchange money digitally? would prefer not to use youtrip or instarem cause i cant link those cards to moomoo or webull,btohqsg
Gurus  if I changed money digitally in iChange wallet  can I change back leftover amount?,btohqsg
I think is it one way only,btohqsg
Is 3.43% pa returns good at this present age?,btohqsg
Hi. May I ask  if I can use my maybank platinum visa to pay for my bills to clock the 3.33%? I know that this card can use for insurance  but only can clock half of the tier on insurance. (E.g. if I wanna clock $1000 tier  I only can use $500 on insurance),btohqsg
HSBC TravelOne Credit Card Review: 1 year laterhttps://youtu.be/Lorv-ezmxrI,btohqsg

hi does anyone know if there is  any way to view our debit card details on ocbc360 app (cvv  expiry date),btohqsg
Is the content bad or something was the information from him helpful?,btohqsg
In the world of content  there are bound to be topics that appeal to you and those that do not.Just choose those topics that you prefer to watch.,btohqsg
And to be frank  Kelvin's research and delivery on investing/stock market content is pretty up there. As well as those step by step guide for beginners is very helpful,btohqsg
Why not just try watching and see if it's to your liking?,btohqsg
You are rightmaybe I should give it a try and watch his video perhaps there is something interesting,btohqsg
