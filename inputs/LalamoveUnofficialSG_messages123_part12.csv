But $1? Don't think so $1 la maybe after completion they give full sum. Hope to know more about that too,btohqsg
"As much said there are still many drivers who took crazy orders...if its more than 30% extra of the listed weight i won't take...its not fair to other drivers ...the guy who ordered the delivery said that ""why others can take and you can't"" my reply was i dont like cheating or to be cheated of what that is due to me ...same as to other lalamove drivers",btohqsg
You should reply to that guy why so many people die but not you. HAHAHA ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
One statement will do  company policy.,btohqsg
Thats their medical orders... they will put $1 base fare.. plus priority fee afterwards..,btohqsg
I saw $1+15 but multi drips,btohqsg

Can lah  tie on top the van . But must engage crank service.,btohqsg
Customer though your van is as big as lorry,btohqsg
At least they stated  some give surprises.,btohqsg
But they don't feel that their bed is bigger,btohqsg
Queen bed isn't 160 185? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Guy  beside the size there is something you need to take care of. Queen size need to dismantle before it can fit in your 2.4m van. Whether need to assemble the bed at drop off? Drivers with tools can do it but need to settle the cost before doing. Dismantle n assembling take out sometime depends on experience n model. Not all beds the same  example storage bed...,btohqsg
Llm hoping forever you dun received and cash outðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Llm is a charity organization  they introduced fxxktard rules and regulations to con driver,btohqsg
They are not afraid of you filing a complaint  you are just a partner  not under employment act,btohqsg

Singapore llm sxxk big time.. welcome to the city of silkapourðŸ¤£,btohqsg
They act like the Govt  they can tell you NSWE front  back  left or right grandfatherâ€™s story end up not allowing you to withdraw and penalties for whatever reason they love to and suspend the account whichever they like,btohqsg
They using threatening Tactic to make you afraid and given u 3 day warning but donâ€™t dare to ban u forever cos they know more driver will leave in the end,btohqsg
Hi what is the best timing to start work for llm,btohqsg
If u are asking about specific timing of a day  I would say the best timing is around 11am-1pm and also around 5-7pm at areas like little India  jalan sultan or central areas etc,btohqsg
Basically the lunch and dinner delivery times,btohqsg
Tend to have more priority fee and if lucky high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Y'all tell me isn't this overloading and overweight? And if I'm right to charge additional for this delivery? And yet not my responsibility for the safety since they booked motorcycle. And it's heavy af,btohqsg
5-7pm erp timing also if weekdaysSo better choose job properly if not lugi,btohqsg
Weekdays 10am to 5pm at cbd is goodWeekends 12 noon to 7pm is goodAfter 7pm very little orders and hard to snatch,btohqsg
llm tis courier delivery v misleading,btohqsg
