Exactly. Red flags. Don’t marry them. I’m not saying that find someone with no red flags  because that’s impossible. I’m saying figure out how far you’re willing to put up with them. And which are intolerable.,btohqsg
"Hi bro; I'm much older than most of the peeps in the group (i'm in uni late)but let me give you a 2 cent- I was supposed to BTO my ex  but she fucked my best friend (of 25 years) and it was all kaputdont think too much about love- It comes and go  the person you love rn may or may not be there forever  and that is a sad reality we will have to accept. Sooner or later  as you grow  you will come to the realisation that there is no such thing as ""good for each other"" etc  people learn to be better partners as they grow and mature. There is no ""the one""  only ""lets try"".Maybe i am a jaded man  but trust me on this  dont think too much  your youth is precious- fuck anyone you want  do anything you want  study anything you want. There will come a day where you just ""know"" and it isnt that complicated- and when it does come  you'll truly understand what im saying",btohqsg

I know I am not in your shoes but you should not treat any other girl like how your ex treated you. theres many fish in the sea,btohqsg

nihilism isnt about the lack of meaning  its about making and finding your own meaning,btohqsg
I am gonna work on myself so I can choose the girl I want,btohqsg
"without a divine imposed meaning or a ""universe given meaning""  there is no inherent meaning in everything  only then you are free to have all the meaning you want in life",btohqsg
What’s the difference in typing styles between genders that you could use to prove it in full proof,btohqsg

Step one — accept that your opinion of yourself is as deficient as your naming skills  so just let your future wife stick to having the veto on deciding the kids names  k?,btohqsg
