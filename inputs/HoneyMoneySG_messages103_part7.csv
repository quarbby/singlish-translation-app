Anyone know if casino levy count towards uob one spending of 500?,btohqsg
My impression I used uob credit card to pay for my prudential and it counts towards the $500 spending requirement. Probably got to wait next month to check as I pay manually.,btohqsg
Same thing for activesg top up  I will try next month since I still have value in my wallet to pay food purchase. Hopefully  they will fix the xnap issue by then.,btohqsg

Hey there  just looking to tap on e expertise within this group regarding CPF matters (Reaching FRS vs using OA money for BTO):TLDRWhat are e pros and cons of reaching FRS faster in my case  versus saving that OA money for my BTO next year?I‚Äôm wondering whether I should transfer my OA to SA to get closer to e FRS quicker with e recent change in policy and wondering whether there is any value in reaching FRS quicker versus waiting longer to reach it and saving e OA for e upcoming house instead in 2025.Some context:- my BTO arrives 2025  2nd quarter  we‚Äôve already made e first 5% down payment in 2020- almost 40 years old- working for 19 years already  first 9 years pay was extremely low (didn‚Äôt even get taxed so that gives you an idea of how low it was)- wife is employed- currently  OA: $77k  SA: $145k  MA: $71k- have been transferring OA to SA consistently for e last 10 years- not willing to use cash to top up SA because it goes into our monthly rent for e last 4 years whilst we‚Äôve been waiting for our BTO + we‚Äôll need e cash for e upcoming renovation + have been setting aside cash to invest on a monthly basis for e last 4 years rather than put it into e SA- looking to take a short sabbatical next year after the BTO arrives before resuming work in 2026Apologies for e long text but  am Hoping/ looking forward to hear the pros and cons of my thought process/ get some input from e various experiences within e group üòä - just trying my luck here and giving it a shot by asking.,btohqsg
"Personally  i will first top up 8k to SA to get the tax relief benefit  and trf the remainder using OA if u want to reach FRS quicker.U can count that 8k (or a lesser amt) as part of your investment portfolio. The tax relief means u get immediate returns for topping up (its more signifcant in the 7% income cat)Once you get ur bto  ur montly mortgage can be funded by OA. With my method above  u can take it as ""borrowing"" 8k from your OA at 2.6% interest (assume hdb loan) and getting a tax relief return of 7% + (4% sa - 2.6% hdb loan)Hope this helps",btohqsg
Thanks! Will think about e cash top up for tax relief‚Ä¶Is there any value in reaching FRS quicker? Or would it be better to keep that money in e OA and use it for BTO to reduce e HDB loan and hence reduced accrued interest? We‚Äôve already made e first 5% down payment in 2020. So I‚Äôm deciding how much to pay off upon key collection and‚Ä¶ that would be impacted by whether I transfer OA to SA to reach FRS quickerI know that transferring to SA gives better returns (4%) as compared to the HDB loan rate of 2.6% but just asking nonetheless,btohqsg
What do you  mean if it‚Äôs true? It‚Äôs 1 person‚Äôs opinion thats all,btohqsg
Cardup is already online and the moment you use it  you are charged with fees. So technically won't really get full mpd  but paying for the miles. And cardup transactions might not even get you bonus miles.,btohqsg
Accured interest only matters if u intend to sell ur hse. Otherwise i wont think too much about it. Plus ur sales proceed with cover the next hse if you do sell  even if u sold at a loss  u are not required to compensate the difference.Depends on ur goal. Reaching FRS early is opportunity cost for tax relief. The impact will be small if your income bracket wont hit 11.5% (since u got SRS you can use too). For your actual situation  I cant advice you on this.,btohqsg
Not sure what to you mean by full mpd? Cardup transactions only earn base miles/points.,btohqsg
You can go on chat assist to cancel the delivery of the debit card. It worked for me.,btohqsg

Hi  I've just signed up for the UOB Big Savings Payout.May i clarify if i top up $50K into my UOB ONE account on 30Apr  will i be able to get the $250 credit (for the big savings payout promo) plus the 4% interest on the $150K in May? Thanks,btohqsg
At 100k MAB  and maintaining same or increase of MAB subsequent month  3% p.a.,btohqsg
Better check your MAB in Mar first to confirm how much you actually need to deposit,btohqsg
UOB PAYOUT  can we withdraw out say 100k for 1 day  then deposit through other bank  just like some discussion earlier about clearing their balances before month end.,btohqsg
This promo  uob uses ur average daily balance so this doesn't really work any more.,btohqsg
"Your ""discussion earlier"" might be very outdated info. Maybe you want to search the chat for ""uob big savings payout"" for more recent info.",btohqsg

What are the chances to be the first 500 for those lightning deal if I apply now?,btohqsg
Need opinions from here for UOB my MAB on March is 100k  May and June AC balance zero  will park my fund at other place. 1. Either will join the payout promo before 29th June fresh fund 50k. Total 150k. Earmark bonus $250.2. or just wait for the July promo. To fund in 150k?,btohqsg
For current UOB payout promo  my understanding that ur march MAB will be used.Opt 1  if u join in June  it just delays ur cash credit.Opt 2  assume jul promo is the same  you lose out interest for 2 months. If ur alternative place to park money has good interest  can be a good option. Ofc  we can't predict future and UOB can come up with total different promo.,btohqsg

hi all  what's the hack for income tax payment? which card best to use to pay?,btohqsg
If your returns on everything isn‚Äôt higher than the debt interest  why not pay off the debt first,btohqsg
The debts have a tenure of 3-5 years. If I pay earlier  i have to pay penalty..,btohqsg
No. Not really because paying my debts early will only incur additional costs.,btohqsg
