All the petrol comes from the same place in singapore,btohqsg
just that reach every company they add in additives that's all,btohqsg
i dunno..i always have this perspective that oil come from the same resource..Bought over by oil company and put into different company brands and market it..Just like the same aspect as Gold..They mine and sell ans market it..So to me i feel all the oil from different brands..their oil is somehow same same,btohqsg
So it doesn't matter where you pump,btohqsg
its just how they market and brand it,btohqsg
They got add their own additives la.,btohqsg
it doesn't matter  in the end all works the same way,btohqsg
the additives doesn't take up like 50% of the petrol,btohqsg
Not all petrol is the same in MY btw,btohqsg
Petron and Petronas 97 is clearly better than the rest,btohqsg
SG vpower grade equivalent not necessary either,btohqsg
SG all the petrol come from same refinery,btohqsg
if its an old kia just go 95,btohqsg
even workshop tell me waste money pump 98,btohqsg
if compare ron rating  yes  high comp engine needs higher ron to work,btohqsg
your regular cars go 95 can already,btohqsg
Min 95 onwards if want to tc of the engine,btohqsg
Most cars under 300hp can and should pump 95,btohqsg
your old 90s V10 doing 300hp only i think 95 also can handle,btohqsg
It's all based on your engine's compression ratio,btohqsg
Hi can let me know what u need. See if I can do,btohqsg
95 onwards the fuel is clean enough,btohqsg
i found already. was looking for system formwork,btohqsg
