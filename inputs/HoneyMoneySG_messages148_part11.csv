Hi all  DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard can earn 2% cashback on mrt/bus ?,btohqsg
The transactions you paid was for Schools and Educational Services; and Utilities RELATED that were not eligible for UNI$ rewards.The transaction category is based on service/goods that you purchased  not based on the payment intermediary. And we found that purchase were not eligible for rewards.Above massge is reply from uob bank . Im not earning UNI$ for my cardup education service payment ( using uob prvi miles master card ) . Got any idea ?,btohqsg
I think uob card cant use for cardup services,btohqsg
Did you use some special promo code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Oh yeah you are right ? cos i use master card promotion code . Thats why i think,btohqsg
Ya I think there were some discussion previously that no rewards given for using these codes cos the MCC will fall under education (excluded by UOB),btohqsg
You means uob card can't use for master card promotion code,btohqsg
Not that uob card cant use for the promo code but that using those promo code u get mcc that from cardup that is not eligble for rewards,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Yeah thats why i only pay 1.53 % cardup fees using master card promotion code .,btohqsg
With no reward then become net loss loh,btohqsg
Using Special promo code  rewards are not guaranteed. Their mcc areMCC 6513 and MCC 8299,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Oh you means bettet dont use promotion code and pay normal fees 2.6% cardup fees .,btohqsg
Visit Cardup website for more info.,btohqsg
"So end up no rewards. Should have read CardUp's t&c before doing anything. They literally stated that ""card rewards not guaranteed"" and there are already DPs that stated MCC will be 6523 and 8299 for Rent and Education for these promo codes.",btohqsg
Hi. Is there any current promotion for existing citi customer applying for citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Yeah i saw . Just test . This is my risk . Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Or use an eligible Visa card  1.85% fee promo code.,btohqsg
Yeah i saw . Just test . This is my risk .Thanks üôè,btohqsg
In the future   better dont use promotion code . Pay 2.6% fees üòÅ,btohqsg
I read already . But what i understand the T&C are 50% 50% . Anyway thanks bro,btohqsg
Use Visa recurring 1.85% or master card 2.25% unless you have ocbc card.,btohqsg
"anyone knows if i can just spend 4k in the first month to be qualified for  UOB PRVI Miles Card signup promo regarding ""26 000 miles: Spend min. S$2 000 spend per month for 2 consecutive months from card approval date"". my maybank card  that requires 2 consecutive month  managed to get the promo when i spend double during the first month",btohqsg
You should re-read both t&cs.Spend $x per month for 2 consecutive months from card approval date VS spend $x within 2 months from card approval date are 2 different things.,btohqsg
They even underline the 2 consecutive months,btohqsg
my maybank was first 2 consecutive months as well,btohqsg
So you spent $1.2k on first month only or you spent at least $600 on both months each?,btohqsg
i spend 1.2k on the first month and got it few days after the purchase,btohqsg
U want to challenge bank tnc go ahead loh  bank have the right to not give u the promo gift,btohqsg
maybe it was just a maybank thing lol,btohqsg
If they decide to claw back rewards  they still can. Best to not take chances with the t&cs.,btohqsg
lolMaybe they will ‚Äòplug the gap‚Äô soon,btohqsg
Honestly if they only plug the gap is better than claw back from OP and plugging the gap ü§≠,btohqsg
How to complete Shieldy bot verification?,btohqsg
Reminds me how some users call UOB CSO over the Fast transfer hack üôÉ,btohqsg
TrueI am sure they will calculate & see what works best.To irk the customer by saying it was an error n claw back or to just take the hit  plug the gap n not retrospectively claw back.,btohqsg
actually this promo was many months ago when i first applied. now i see their promo is spend x amount within 2 months already,btohqsg
Yup.. that's why when I searched the latest card promos  it says first 2 months instead.,btohqsg
hi  want to check on the electricity retailer. which one is the cheapest as for now,btohqsg
Hi  my CPF MA has reached max $71.5k  would like to check when can I top up the additional $4k for 2025? Can I top up now?,btohqsg
BHS is $75.5k. You have not reached max.,btohqsg
Just to update doesn‚Äôt mean u earn above $120k means u definitely won‚Äôt be affected by the MAS 12 months unsecured interest bearing balances rule.I have a human with total balance transfers exceeding 12 months income with non HSBC banks.HSBC reduced the credit card limits of this human. I think HSBC tightened their policies recently.,btohqsg
U have to do it NOW,btohqsg
So that human earn 120k but have rolling balance on their cc until even other bank reduce their limit. Must have owe alot sia üßê,btohqsg
MAS is regulatory nallunsecured accounts will be suspended. Ie they cannot even use their cards.For those above s$120 earners action by FIs are discretionary and up to individual bank to take preventive measure to reduce their risk.,btohqsg
Yeah but confirmed something changed at HSBC recently.All along we have been like that. Suddenly kenna slapped.,btohqsg
About 14 months of last updated income total bts for that human,btohqsg
Maybe their numbers are looking that good. Hence the preemptive measure.,btohqsg
