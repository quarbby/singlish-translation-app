yupyup you're right  it is. is that the reason? but I've successfully used it for contactless payment a couple of times before today though.,btohqsg
Yes.. That's the main reason. U use apple pay? You can use using apple pay but not through app e.g. NTUC or your case koufu. Apple pay uses a different card number at the back end.,btohqsg
I see. I'm using google pay. paying through google pay as well. is it the same for Google pay?,btohqsg

Beginner here  Thank you in advanceü´°,btohqsg
Maybe amaze want to stop people from using amaze indirectly as a cash advance?,btohqsg
Does liquid pay convert to online transaction when paying for hawkers ? E.g. DBS WWMC,btohqsg
would u pay the sin to lhr flight ticket at that price using cash? If not then the value of miles is lower than 2.5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Does anybody have any issues trying to buy this ETF from DBSI bring trying to buy it for 10 times got an email it saying unsuccessful ?,btohqsg
I start to think that this a exclusive ETF,btohqsg
Few questions you need to ask yourself before valuing the miles:1). Are you able to earn enough miles to redeem the SIN-LHR ticket? Some miles has expiry date  some do not have.2). Is there ticket for you to redeem if you are not willing to be in waiting list?,btohqsg
