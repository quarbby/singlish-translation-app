Aztech delisted back then 2017. I lost a good 100k. Very screw up what they did back then.They managed to delist with offer of $0.42 that got some how over 78% if i recalled.I shouldn’t have took it but broker advised to.Within a year after they delisted they paid dividends of $0.40 .Then recently another dividends of $0.42 in2019/2020.Unethical play but smart move. If I didn’t listen to broker and left it right there then Swee already.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone able to add me to US Stock group? Thank you,btohqsg
NAV was $1.20 . My cost $0.85,btohqsg
They never got privatised after.The AGM everyone F them also.Because they played a smart card . With less than 90% of shares they managed to delist from stock market,btohqsg
If want to delist why come back now.. cheat alot of people money really.,btohqsg
I think they got 79% votes to $85% only but somehow grey area and got delisted instead of privatised.,btohqsg
Yea man really didn’t expect them to delist also. Should not listen to broker also.Where got offer $0.42 to delist and then within 1 year Give $0.40 dividends..They really cheat Sg hard earned money.,btohqsg
