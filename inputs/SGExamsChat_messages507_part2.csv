time to take up self-defence class,btohqsg
im in my poly‚Äôs archery ccacan shoot people with arrow as self defense üòÄ,btohqsg
I can only imagine a shooting that happens in singapore,btohqsg
maybe like jp. results of being overly sheltered,btohqsg
remember the river valley high school attack1 student got killed by an axe and it already made the whole country shake,btohqsg
meanwhile america has school shootings so frequently with way more than 1 person killed,btohqsg
There is so many instances of emergency that have yet to happen to Singapore in recent times‚Ä¶it will be really intresting how we will react,btohqsg
Like a mass shooting  building collapse,btohqsg
Is scdf ready to face a building collapse,btohqsg
u gt see the two recent attacks (one successful / failed) ? the ppl there do not how to react,btohqsg
not used to it most likely,btohqsg
these kind of incidents are very rare,btohqsg
I rmb abt a article on a fire on a offshore island,btohqsg
They legit had to transport fire trucks on barges,btohqsg
To send them to the island to continue battling the flame,btohqsg
It‚Äôs unique instances like this that really make me wonder how we are going to react,btohqsg
And whether our response is capable,btohqsg
i know CECAü§£. all come with chapalang uni cert then steal our jobs,btohqsg
The shit that surprised me was the assasination,btohqsg
A homemade shotgun that could kill?,btohqsg
its so funny lolim still laughing,btohqsg
Yea I know but rarely does it involved a firearm from what I believe,btohqsg
The fact is that it was a homemade weapon,btohqsg
Yea the anthrax shit was deadly,btohqsg
But bro had a cult without it I doubt you could pull it off,btohqsg
Lmao last minute decision prob changed that person‚Äôs life,btohqsg
Hijackers planned to seek asylum in Cuba‚Ä¶but plane could not fly to cuba.So their next best option was North Korea and they were granted asylum in North Korea,btohqsg
That is some last minute 0iq thinking,btohqsg
Legend has it that Kento Bento is still making that part 2,btohqsg
most of Tesla's value is speculation anyways. a bubble waiting to burst,btohqsg
isit cuz of the china recall?,btohqsg
and also US economy is in shambles. we have a 50-50 chance of recession this decade. Investors don't have confidence,btohqsg
alot of them are shorting SNP500,btohqsg
oh yeaaa. some alr said we r in reccession,btohqsg
coupled together with finite lithium supplies,btohqsg
cant rmb but the jp morgan ceo said smth that we r gg to reccesion soon haha,btohqsg
not really  mostly the West. European nations and US are facing around 10-15% inflation. and sgreans complain about 3% ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Singapore still safe. considering most of our economy is tied to China and not the west. but if China and US proceed to do some funny funny thing  SG confirm fucked the hardest,btohqsg
time to buy intel stocks folks,btohqsg
should be within that range. 3-4% is healthy inflation. Not too little to show no economic growth and not too much to show weak currency,btohqsg
buy Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. US preparing for war on 2 fronts. Stocks will rise and will earn $$$ if no war happens. If WW3 happens  you wouldn't need the money anyways ü§£,btohqsg
anyways ah  I need help for O lvl combined Chem. I understand got alot of stuff must brute force memorize like solubility etc etc. if anyone got simplified notes or tips to remember the content  please send me üôèüôè,btohqsg
Zoom out for the 2 year chart its gonna be even worse,btohqsg
oh yea nah must wait for US to fuck up,btohqsg
Random qn how many of y'all useIntel or AMD,btohqsg
yeah I can understand when I'm reading the notes and doing questions but the moment my notes gone I cannot do anything alr. from Acid  bases  salt onwards gg liao,btohqsg
these you need to actually do practicals to understand them more,btohqsg
problem is I private candidate lol. last year I supposed take O level but I knew I was gonna F9 anyways,btohqsg
school didn't even want to take me back,btohqsg
