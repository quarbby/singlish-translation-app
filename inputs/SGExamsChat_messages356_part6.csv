I feel guilty if i do better than those who did so much,btohqsg
i mean some people learn quicker,btohqsg
diff ppl better at diff stuff,btohqsg
i'm squarely in the not much practice group  but not that i don't study  i spent 90% of my time understanding it,btohqsg
my friends need to grind examples to get it,btohqsg
if it works for you  you're good,btohqsg
im the same as ur friends unfortunately,btohqsg
but I think I recover from burnout alr so it's all good,btohqsg
even through uni i've felt weird that i don't practice as much  but if you did your best prep work,btohqsg
thanks and atb to you too,btohqsg
