Guys a questionIf i turn 55 in 2026   how much can i withdraw from my OA ?FRS maxed with 300 000 in my OABUTthe 300 000 that i have in my OA  100 000 is with Great Eastern's SP investment plan,btohqsg
you never mention your SA balance,btohqsg
Assuming i have 300 000 in OA + maxed FRS after balance in SA is distributed to my OA and SA already,btohqsg
then it would be $200k which is $300k - $100k with GEactually you should not say you have $300k OA then..you only see $200k in your OA when u log into CPF right?,btohqsg
Whatever that is in SA at 55 + remaining amounts to hit FRS from OA will form RA. Then the rest will stay in OA and will be withdrawable.,btohqsg
What is the withdrawable limit ? Is it unlimited withdrawals and what is the amount for each withdrawal ?Any ways to calculate ?,btohqsg
OA is like savings account... can withdraw anytime,btohqsg
CPF members can make withdrawals from their CPF savings starting from age 55.The amount you can withdraw depends on your birth year and the age you are making the withdrawal. You do not need to withdraw everything; you can withdraw only what you need  when you need it and as often as you need to because with PayNow  you can receive your CPF savings almost instantaneously.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/forms-e-applications/withdraw-cpf-retirement-needs,btohqsg
For online .A default online Daily Withdrawal Limit of $2 000 a day is applied to all CPF members aged 55 and above. You can adjust the online Daily Withdrawal Limit up to a maximum of $50 000  at any time underAccount settingsviaSingpass authentication.,btohqsg
Thank you so much üôè Basically OA is like a personal bank account at 55 and the RA is monthly payout from govt right ?,btohqsg
last time did not have this.. but too many scams so they imposed this,btohqsg
yes OA is like personal bank account but only pay 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Thank you and the rest for the help   really appreciate itüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
If you want liquidity then you have to accept lower returns which is similar to other financial products on the market how it is setup.,btohqsg
but bank savings account can pay above 2.5% p.a. nowand even above 3.45% p.a.sorry not sure you referring to CPF or the Singlife,btohqsg
I was referring to CPF difference between OA and RA. The funds in OA can be withdrawn anytime but the interest is 2.5% compared with RA 4% but you have to follow their stricter rules of usage,btohqsg
Can deposit it back anytime after withdraw if above 55?,btohqsg
i think it is one way..after 55.. all topups go to RA... only to boost CPF Life,btohqsg
OA can only out. RA can only in.,btohqsg
Still better to throw OA to tbills now?,btohqsg

More than 12 months with zero citi credit cards,btohqsg
That will be a different promo (2nd quarter). These durations in ur screenshot won't be applicable.,btohqsg
Which offer is a better deal? #1 or #2?,btohqsg
The Uob promo now is very difficult to participate. U need to empty your account for one calendar month before start of the new promo.,btohqsg
depends on how you value miles. For option2  you are essentially buying 22000 miles for $196.2 or 0.89cents per miles  which to me is pretty ok since I value miles around 1.5c/mile. Anything below 1.5 cents/mile is already a profit.,btohqsg
