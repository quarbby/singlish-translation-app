usually I won't exceed CRMC $1K per month  but if I do then for:1) DBS WWMC 4mpd for online transaction (non amaze)2) UOB PPV 4mpd for mobile contactless,btohqsg
Yes  provided they know how to use Apple pay or google pay,btohqsg
Not worth for kirsflyer miles on grab,btohqsg
Not worth. 80 000 pts = 160 000 miles,btohqsg
SQ -  Krisflyernon SQ - DBSWWMC if < $2000  else PRVI,btohqsg
Thx  Still trying to process 😅 always been a cashback person. Now just started to learn abt miles,btohqsg
I will like to ask a question about CPF I hit 192k in sa last month but this month the sa amount still top up as normal,btohqsg
Can check what should be the limit for this year,btohqsg
FRS is 192k this year  but contributions will still go in even if u have hit the limit,btohqsg
This only can be bought in physical stores?,btohqsg
Hope it’ll still be around when I go tmr 🤣,btohqsg
Is this eligible when buy caifan 10% cashback?,btohqsg
And Nestia new sign up still will get $3?,btohqsg
Help update us  if can use CC buy,btohqsg
Hi Friends  planning to sign up for Maybank platinum Visa card to pay IRAS tax using cardup. After cardup fees will be getting 1.58% cashback (3.33-1.75). Is this the best option or anything else? Basically I prefer cashback over miles. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
If overseas spent would you recommend Amaze + UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
the $3 cap is capped per day or per order or for the entire campaign? lol,btohqsg
Hi  just want to ask  if I only have these 2 CCsI should be usingCitiPremier Miles : for plane tickets + hotel bookings.Citi rewards + Amaze : for general overseas spending.Is this correct ?,btohqsg
Yup. But be careful of using citi rewards + Amaze when dining at hotels,btohqsg
Thank you ! Why is that so though ?,btohqsg
Restaurants in hotels may take travel mcc which citi rewards excludes,btohqsg
Okay thank you for the explanation !! 👍🏻,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if we can use our cpf-oa monies to invest in UOB FD?,btohqsg
Hi bros  considering getting my second CC.. should I be getting Citi Premiermiles or HSBC revo,btohqsg
I think it depends on bank if they offer fd for cpfis.And some ‘promo’ rates are not applicable for thise using cpfis to put in one.,btohqsg
which card give 4 mpd for fairprice app ? read HSBC revk not give 4 mpd for it,btohqsg
Ok thanks!! Will call the banks to check it out,btohqsg
Evol card holders  wanna check  if does Apple Store subscriptions count into UOB Evol online spends?,btohqsg
May I know if this approach can apply for Property Tax instalment plan?,btohqsg
Want HSBC better apply faster if u need urgent as is processed is slow same as uob,btohqsg
not sure what is your use case or preference.personally  im using citi rewards as a baseline for day to day use  until $1000 is up  i'll switch to UOB Absolute Amex.,btohqsg
icic  for big ticket items and hotel/travel booking u use UOB amex?,btohqsg
not sure if anyone asked this before  but anyone can suggest good ways to pair up cc and kris+?,btohqsg
This will depends  if it’s a relatively big amount maybe 1k and above  I’ll buy it with my wife’s card  so we “consolidate” our miles.Otherwise  I’ll be using either UOB or CRMC whichever can give me better benefits at that point,btohqsg
I pair with WWMC for 4MPD,btohqsg
I heard that we can apply for HSBC Premier with 15k monthly transfer  is that still correct? If yes  is there any minimum amount to maintain for not charged for fee?,btohqsg
Hello there. Any idea if we’re able to get miles with the Citi Rewards card by topping up Grab Pay wallet? Does that count as an online transaction?,btohqsg
cannot  it's excluded from the rewards already,btohqsg
pardon me  i tried searching but can't conclude. Regarding liquidpay  do i need to link CRMC to Amaze  then add Amaze as payment method or i can directly add CRMC as payment method on Liquidpay?,btohqsg
ohh no  i did the latter  so all not counted as 4mpd?,btohqsg
Gotta refer to the MCC code for your purchase on whether you'll get the points,btohqsg
thanks  wasted all on hawker and didn't earn points  will add my amaze card instead thanks!,btohqsg
thought should still earn points since it is online spend?,btohqsg
need others to confirm  without linking amaze,btohqsg
Maybe u can check on the app if they count it as points?,btohqsg
Anyone's on Kris app got referral wanna share codes,btohqsg

Why do u think liquid pay doesn’t give 4mpd?,btohqsg
