"""We like what is given out in the food packs. The items provided help us cut down on living expenses so that we can spend on other things like medical bills.” - Lim Geok Kheng",btohqsg
For Lim Geok Kheng  a beneficiary of Food from the Heart  eating a proper meal can be a luxury. Lim Geok Kheng is plagued with kidney failure  and is too feeble to continue her job as a factory cook. She even has to cook her own meals seated on a chair. Her husband Law Cheng Huak  74  rushes to shuttle her to and fro dialysis thrice a week before work. Food from the Heart supports the couple with consistent rations comprising fresh fruit  eggs and bread  as well as non-perishable food items like rice  canned food and cooking oil. The steady source of food not only alleviates their financial burden but also provides a greater peace of mind.Like Mdm Lim  there are many needy beneficiaries out there that do not have enough money to have a proper meal  as they need the money for critical expenses such as utilities  school fees and medical bills. Your contribution will truly help them a great deal.

But having said that   it’s your right to complain since you should receive your goods in good order,btohqsg
So appealing to u to see if u can forgive him lor:)),btohqsg
No la  I am not delivery rider haha,btohqsg
I receive spilled order  but I dunno if should complain cos dun wan affect the rider,btohqsg
I know I am asking u to imagine,btohqsg
If foodpanda cover then ok lor  if penalise the rider then sua,btohqsg
If u are panda u want to always cover,btohqsg
Maybe say x times for Y trips,btohqsg
Then our fren sway already kannaLiao,btohqsg
Later if he lose his job then I hope u feel bad,btohqsg
But is your right lah bro....just thot if not serious then maybe sua la,btohqsg
I don’t think the rider will be penalised to the point where his job is on the line tbh.,btohqsg
While you can be compassionate and understanding. Ultimately  safely delivering product with an acceptable amount of blemishes. Is part of the job. However this responsibility do not solely rest on the shoulders of the rider imo,btohqsg
It could also be the food provider’s packaging issue or overloading of jobs from service provider  building on stress applied to the rider to deliver your consumables in a timely fashion.,btohqsg
Your complaint could highlight a tendency or weak link in the supply chain.Either helping service provider identify if this is an isolated incident  unique to this rider. If the incident is unique to this rider then maybe he’s need to go easier on his speed because definitely you’re not the only ordered that’s affect.Or maybe it’s to the food provider’s packaging not very suited to be delivered in that particular way. After all  just because they wrap the food plastic container and plastic bag don’t mean it’s going to be 100% spill-free. Especially so because a food delivery thermal bag is not exactly an world class secure equipment.,btohqsg

MYTH: COVID-19 was circulating last summer at Greenspring  an assisted living facility in Springfield.Fact: Testing of specimens collected during the outbreak of respiratory illness at Greenspring in July 2019 showed several bacteria  including Haemophilus influenzae (H. flu) and rhinovirus  the cause of the common cold. There is no need to re-investigate the outbreak. At the time  the Virginia Department of Health put out an alert about an increase in respiratory illnesses in long-term care facilities .The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City  China in December 2019. At this stage  it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported on January 20  2020 in Snohomish County  Washington and the first confirmed case in Virginia was reported on March 7  2020.

"Sorry.. I meant cite credible sources.You can Google ""earth is flat"" or ""big foot sightings"" but that does not make them real.Look... Did WTO say anything? Did SG gov say anything? If not  please go verify your information before you post them here. Go dig a little bit more and do proper research. Proper research does not equalgoogle.com.",btohqsg
"Yup. Anyone can cut and paste different soundbites to make people look incredible smart or stupid.Things need to be put in context.Eg.""there are ten apples...""Vs""there are ten apples but they are all rotten"".It is a political satire show and the main aim of the show is to entertain rather than to inform.It is easy to get confuse in the world that is full of misinformation. One really need to dig and look for credible sources before we can trust them.It seems you are very passionate about Covid19 and and I hope God will help you find the truth.",btohqsg
Hi guys i need to get a clipboard. Do u know of any stationery shop tat is open?,btohqsg
This ah long though legit and have proper permit to operate  but they will make one hell of a living life out of the ppl who seeks loanFor eg: threaten calls and msg  frequent follow up  blackmailing  basically use all those “ah Long” method to get back their repayment,btohqsg
So F*** uAh Long and GTFO,btohqsg
U can do a DIY clipboard,btohqsg
Yeah maybe i shld do tat,btohqsg
I did a clean sweep of the house to prep for hari raya. Haha. Noting tat i can tink of to use for materials,btohqsg

Legit?? Lol.. where got moneylender rates so high?? They only allow seldom percentage only per month or per year... oi ah long  i tell you  go f your ancestor.,btohqsg
In times of situation like this  some ppl who got retrenched are desperate for $$ to feed their familyAh Long use this tactics and timing to approach the victimsAnd nowadays even those who has jobs either got their income cut or not getting enough paid eg taxi driver/ food riderDid u all remember news not Long ago got some ppl queue up for those licensed shops for a loan think Clementi,btohqsg

"Dude... You started by saying that the Singapore government was the one that helped spread this virus based on sources that are not credible.Like I said. You need to know how to do your research. WHO and many countries has never mentioned anything about the Singapore government spreading/starting this virus.Credible sources are key. You cannot just find ""facts"" from Google.Else everyone will believe that the earth is flat and airplanes fly with magic.If you are really passionate about this topic and want to find out the truth  do a proper research and investigate.My advise is to be wary of confirmation bias. You will need to argue with yourself from both sides else you may fall into your trap of finding ""facts"" that will only help your own case while ignoring the truth.Peace man and may the good Lord help you find the truth and peace.",btohqsg
"I didn't mentioned ""help spread"" ""starting""  I am just parody those idiots who named the virus by the ruling political party. Since you says CCP  then we should have UMNO  BN  PAP  Republican virus too.",btohqsg
Why you go hysterical and keep mention God? He don't have time for you. Stop this chat.,btohqsg
All this anyhow bomb de. Katong blah blah.. ask them whether ah long they also dare not admit. Lol.. f them la..,btohqsg
Dude.. You said Singapore ruling party virus? Isn't that what you first said? That was totally baseless..To me  I could had call it CCP virus or alien virus or big foot virus  it would not be true if it is not based on fact.According to WHO  the virus was first reported to WHO by China on 31st December. That is fact.Like I said before  if you are truly interested in this topic  go do a proper research and investigation.Google.comis not considered credible.,btohqsg
I believe in God and I believe He has time for me and for you.If you are not prepared to hear about it  I will leave it be. If you are  you may message me anytime  and I will share with you.,btohqsg
Hope that you will be with him soon.,btohqsg

Keep it to yourself. Don't try to spread it silently in this group like covid.,btohqsg
Like I said.. Don't say things that are baseless. Unlike my belief  Covid spreads very fast.If you are really interested in Covid19  please do a proper and thorough research and investigation. Thank you.,btohqsg

It can be clear. Just need time and effort. You may need to change/throw/clean a lot of your stuff.How serious is the infestation?,btohqsg
They are found in living rooms as well as bedroom. On the sofa and bed specifically. They move so fast and can be as small as a sand grain,btohqsg
I suspect there are ample narrow gaps for them to hide...,btohqsg
How many bedrooms kenna?The sofa if very old liao  can consider throw lah.Check on all the holes/cracks on the wall corners. Switches box. Cable conduits.,btohqsg
U might also go read up on the incubation period of their eggs. That is why its not gonna be a one time thing. The pest control will come back 2nd round after the incubation period.,btohqsg
2 kena. Only 1 so far not compromised. Bt probably wont hold long also,btohqsg
