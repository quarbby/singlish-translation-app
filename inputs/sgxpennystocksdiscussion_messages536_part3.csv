Good day Hustlepeople Those worry or anticipate that a bigger crash is on the way  will have to make hard decisions to choose to take the losses or not.A $30k portfolio loss could easily become at least $100k portfolio losses if a crash similar to last year‚Äôs Mar 20 crash / any earlier crash comes along.Better to lose the $30k  regroup  refresh and start picking right and apply better  strategies   stricter stop losses.2021 have been really tough to play. Plenty of Traps ü™§ and any slight hesitation can result from profits to losses in matter of seconds / minutes.For me  this chat group will be here forever. There will be a much easier time for us to fight and win back but now is definitely not the time.Stay safe! Good luck and think hard. ‚òùÔ∏èPS: To Any one who is suffering from big losses and feeling depressed. Don‚Äôt be. I was new and took a big -$600k damage when I got hit 9 years back during the ABL Penny crash. It was dark period and I had the extreme thoughts. I‚Äôm glad to have fought on  improve and learn from that episode. Trust me when I say Stop Loss is the key to doing well in this game. I have emphasised it always in this chat but I see that many are still hoping. If chart set up breaks and turn ugly  cut. When chart is good  you can always re enter.,btohqsg
"Pika World Update- 21 September 2021üìâEvergrande Crisis Sending Flu to the Equity MarketWall Street had a tough Monday as significant indices dived sharply. Investors are focusing strongly on China and whether there will be a rescue package for the highly indebted Evergrande. As of now  it appears that state bailout is not on the horizon.The $300 billion of liabilities has soured sentiments across the region as debt obligation appears too tricky  and the default is likely. Moreover  the contagion effects are likely to linger for some time as banks and insurers seem to be badly hit as some had already announced making provision on loan loss.With markets closed in China  Japan and South Korea due to holidays  the thin liquidity amplifies the sell-off. Cryptocurrency is unshielded as it tumbled together with the massive fears roaming across different asset prices.üíéWhy is Evergrande a Global Financial Scare?It appears that the fall of the property giant has a profound impact on the financial market. China  on its part  had warned banks that the company was unlikely to pay its debt obligations. As a result  the Chinese central bank has taken proactive steps to minimise potential liquidity risks by injecting around $14B into the banking system.The uncertainty of how China will and should handle Evergrande is releasing panic as people perceive inaction by the Chinese government as a signal of the green light for the company to collapse.It does not help that a state-owned newspaper wrote on the idea that Evergrande should not be expecting a bailout based on the ""too big to fail"" assumption  further casting a shadow on the fate of the property giant.‚è∞Restructuring or Liquidation?Pika World believes this is a reasonable credit default given the due date of some debt obligations is looming. However  the extent of the spillover damage is contingent on whether we see the company facing restructuring or liquidation.We believe that restructuring can provide a better outcome for all stakeholders. The liability of $313 billion is roughly 6.5% of the holistic liability within the Chinese property ecosystem  and $19 billion is from offshore bonds. Hence  if liquidation happens  the spillover effect is likely to be massive and result in possible 3 mega hurt points.First  it will dent confidence in the property sector and the high yield offshore debt and no doubt set to hurt other financial assets in China.Second  it could spring into other defaults as corporations or banks that have significant exposure to the Evergrande could do underwater.Lastly  we are likely to see a material change in how credit-rating firms view mega-companies based on the stereotypical assumption that state support is always available for offshore US dollar bond markets coupled with onshore markets for various core sectors of the economy.üí°Likelihood of Government Assistance?If we recall  in 2019  the Chinese central bank did intervene in the takeover of Baoshang Bank  which caused credit conditions to sour and in times when there was a massive collapse of Chinese equities and its currency in 2015.The key idea is that the Chinese government may be more ready to allow some forms of distress in financial conditions and intervene only when a significant default movement occurs. This  thus  may cause anxiety as the fallout develops.üîëCommodities Prices Facing PressureAs Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced the country conviction to stabilise commodity prices  prices of contract futures for copper  platinum and palladium fell sharply. Brent Crude futures also dived.As we understand in the past  when the Chinese government looks to cool commodity prices  they tend to release strategic reserves of metals and oils to support a higher supply level and put pressure on prices.Pika World expects the Chinese government to take a more concerted effort to cap prices of key commoditiesüìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Building Permits for August  which is expected to remain stable at 1.6M.",btohqsg
It is 21 September  Tuesday  at 7.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. It is a roller coaster start of the week  and we hope all friends of Pika World have a safe landing.,btohqsg
