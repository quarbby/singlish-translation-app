*NanoFilm Technologies International* *(NANO SP / BUY / TP: S$4.52)**Conference Call Takeaways; Expect Further Re-rating**Differentiated technology-based solutions opens up opportunity in new markets.* The FCVA technology opens up the possibility for usage of materials that have lower melting points such as metals  plastic and rubbers that are generally cheaper materials. As such  Nanofilm is able to metalise these materials and achieve some functionality and surface properties which are similar to metal. Furthermore  the technology provides FCVA with the ability to enter new markets such as personal grooming  new energy  5G  biomedical and aerospace industries that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies.*Bigger wallet share and organic growth to drive revenue from the 3C market.*  We believe Nanofilm has gained market share in the smart phone segment. This is evident through the revenue growth from smart phone  within the advanced materials segment  (10.8% 2017-19 CAGR) that has outpaced that of customer Z‚Äôs (Nanofilm‚Äôs largest customer) smartphone sales (1.1% FY17-19 CAGR). We expect this trend to continue as we understand the group‚Äôs market share (% of total addressable market for surface solution for smart phones) is still relatively small. The group should also benefit from organic growth in the wearables & accessories market  which has a relative low penetration rate and is expanding rapidly.*Second plant in Shanghai to support growth.* The group has in the past  increased production capacity in tandem with revenue growth. Similarly  in order to provide additional production capacity to support the group‚Äôs push to gain market share for the next few years  Nanofilm is in the midst of constructing its second Shanghai plant. The plant  which is expected to be fully operational by end-21  will be able to house 200 more coating equipments which would potentially increase its total number of coating equipments by 2.6x from 122 as at 1H20  to up to 322 units.*Maintain BUY with higher target price of S$4.52* (previously S$4.07). We value NanoFilm based on a higher PEG of 1.0x (growth based on 3-year CAGR of 38.7%)  up from 0.9x  as we narrow the discount to peers‚Äô PEG from 25% to 17% given more analyst coverage and potential earnings upside from better-than-expected margins and new projects.  Our target price implies a 38.7x 2021F PE. We believe its unique technology  superior net margins and sole supplier status for most of its major customers provides a strong competitive advantage and warrants a premium to peers.,btohqsg
Bro VV3 if can hold. Will eventually hit 8 series one. Anything 68-72 is good EP.,btohqsg
My cost is 70  im picking up since it's on an uptrend and high possibility of going beyond 80 so im holding on.,btohqsg
