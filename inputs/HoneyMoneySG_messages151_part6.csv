Hi All  Just curious  need to spend more than 2K on jewels  thinking of using HSBC advance cc (2.5% CB). Does the HSBC rewards program provides additional 1% CB ? And I have the below card1. DBS YUU (0.5%)2. UOB AB AMEX (1.7%)3. HSBC rev (not sure )4. Citi cashback +(1.6%)5. Maybank Barcelona (1.6%). I guess from the above list HSBC adv is higher of 2.5%. Pls help. TIA,btohqsg
yes 2.5% no more additional 1% from everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Can consider new bank sign up. And also split the payment using other 4mpd cards even as cash rebate is higher than your existing deck.,btohqsg
When I click on the link  no T&C. If not I wouldn't be asking here. The pinned message just said new to card customers. So does it apply to debit as well?,btohqsg
New to credit card so you are ok,btohqsg
If you are referring to the pinned message  the tnc wonâ€™t be there. You have to click the link for each card to go to singsaver site. The tnc is at there.,btohqsg
possible to use DBS card to pay HSBC advance then pay DBS bill with EGA Giro ?,btohqsg
Hello! Does citi rewards+Amaze or UOB one credit card work for Anytime fitness membership considering they use EZpay?,btohqsg
Hi  what is the best credit card to use for AXS payment online for education?,btohqsg
None ðŸ˜ž I recall most if not all exclude axs,btohqsg
Can use credit card to pay on axs. The admin told me,btohqsg
I never said cannot use. No rewards thou.,btohqsg
Will the transaction qualify for qualifying spend for new cc ?,btohqsg
Thx. Just to check   does Citi rewards master card helps here? Sorry Iâ€™m a cashback person. If I convert the points to Cash  is it approx 2.27% and if I got chance to add HSBC EGA GIRO  then 1% ? Is my understanding correct ?,btohqsg
Your understanding is correct but why use Citi rewards instead of dedicated cashback card,btohqsg
It up to you to decide which cards u want but I mentioned crmc of cos plus amaze is so that if 1 day u changed your mind to miles then you are already there with your points.,btohqsg
Citi rewards with amaze is the first card that recommend to get for flexibility for points or miles to convert. Hopefully as long Citi donâ€™t exclude amaze,btohqsg
Maybank F&F gives 0.3% cashback cap at 15 cents cashback per transaction.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtwaiting to see another warning call from Maybank,btohqsg
Based on my CB card the max CB is 2.7% UOB AB AMEX(1.7% +1%HSBC EGA GIRO) but with this CRMC it seems I can get 3.27%(2.27% from CRMC +1% HSBC EGA GIRO). Pls correct me if anything is wrong. Thx,btohqsg
Citi is capped at 1k spend. The amex is uncapped.,btohqsg
Thx got it. Then I will split payment first 1K to Citi and remaining to amex,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I want to use DBS yuu in foodpanda. Do you know if selecting the yuu card through Apple Pay in foodpanda will earn me the bonus points or must add the yuu card in foodpanda to get the points?,btohqsg
Was listening to the last youtube video. There one part I dont understand. How is the moomoo existing user promo where u get 1.8% p.a a deal?,btohqsg
Is there a way to earn cashback from credit card payment?,btohqsg
If more than 2K and less than 2.8k ( max CB is 70 SGD) then HSBC adv but itâ€™s bit low 2.5% (no 1% HSBC EGA GIRO) Citi CRMC is 3.27%,btohqsg

Hi all the experts here. Wanted to know how to kickstart the UOB lady solitaire card? Just got it. I choose travel and family.Am planning to book travel stuffs  wondering where to check if the online platform such as Agoda &trip.comqualifies? Or just book direct with hotel & airlines?Am currently using UOB KF.,btohqsg
I would start off with risk vs benefit... How much is your loan and how much can you get from the fund? What's the price volatility? Then ask yourself if your risk appitite is OK for that amount of potential profit?For example  if using promotional balance transfer of 6mth  it only costs me 2.1% and if I can put into a high yield saving account to earn 4.1%  potential profit is 2% and risk is minimal since no forex risk  and no investment involve...,btohqsg
Btw HYSA  as far as I know UOB one account  to get high interest u also can only put 150k$ as cap,btohqsg
