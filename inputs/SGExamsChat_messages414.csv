man I got scammed at sim lim when I was 16,btohqsg
They charged me 200 for 8 gig ram,btohqsg
lmao just attend via zoom meeting or something,btohqsg
Please donate the $6 to Straits Times Pocket Money Fund.,btohqsg
the only games theyre playing is my heart,btohqsg
They are just farming for people who fall for it.They can use automated means to send thousands of messages  and all they need is for one person to fall for it,btohqsg
You could and in quantum mechanics  there are reasons for it  but you’re missing the point. Definitely use your conventions for O/A levels because it is their standard you’re tested against  and those are very often used quantities. At the end of the day tho  It’s about defining a clear notation  not just to be contradictory (unless you’re Bedok). There is nothing wrong with defining things yourself  esp when there will be situations where it makes more sense to change them. There is no such thing as a wrong notation  just an inconsistent one. many professors and textbooks at a higher level define terms differently.,btohqsg
Yes but why bother if there’s no other quantity with the vector directions,btohqsg
anyone wanna help me with mesh analysis💀,btohqsg
fuck not the unless you're bedok,btohqsg
I can help you later if you want,btohqsg
nvm I js send u wtv I learn then u must tell me if correcto,btohqsg
i know why im scared of u,btohqsg
I wouldn’t waste my strength smacking him  though.,btohqsg
What did the dude do to her,btohqsg
the amount of motivation that shit gave me is ridiculous,btohqsg
oh joel didn't do shit to me,btohqsg
Shouldnt yall be studying or smth,btohqsg
Whack so hard gender got switched,btohqsg
Refuse to start on my he.,btohqsg
Today i feeling generous shal grant u ur wish,btohqsg
don't ban my geog god status for her,btohqsg
I cant save u from purgatory its ur punishment,btohqsg
Only 4 more years to go,btohqsg
why does hair drop when you're stressed,btohqsg
ur hair follicles suddenly lose ah,btohqsg
On an unrelated note guys look at this cute as fk bull from Asian cultures museum,btohqsg
my class alot of hair on the floor disgusting,btohqsg
3+1 is 4 total taken 5,btohqsg
If not really 4 more years to go,btohqsg
Iirc I heard pu2 promotional criteria is,btohqsg
Next year h1 a level what,btohqsg
All ik is pass everything can alr,btohqsg
They can’t ask u to pass h1 math again,btohqsg
You are forgetting something very important here,btohqsg
The foundation doesnt apply to her,btohqsg
eh I need a study buddy anyone sec3 here that want to be my study buddy?,btohqsg
I think very long ago we used to book places for members to go and study,btohqsg
tf u hv velocity without displacement ah,btohqsg
Idk what happened to it after that,btohqsg
Thank you so much for stating the obvious.,btohqsg
but it's basically wtv neil said  if i not wrong they book the room and study tgt,btohqsg
is it at the library bro idk,btohqsg
Now all these places dun allow to be booked i think,btohqsg
I mean if yall wan we can just crash@chemcer’s penthouse,btohqsg
who scared people out of here,btohqsg
well not rly i still have exams,btohqsg
I have  no more exams ever,btohqsg
many many situations lol. just think outside standard classical mechanics,btohqsg
Mass is a tensor of rank (2  0),btohqsg
Mass is a generalised vector though,btohqsg
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are equivalent but more powerful formalisms,btohqsg
my phys cher told me inside the earth is a giant magnet that human open up the earth and put inside,btohqsg
sekali he lives in your penthouse basement...like the parasite movie...,btohqsg
Can i borrow ur buggati ?,btohqsg
I have just thrown away Lagrangian at this point,btohqsg
classical ill just stick to newtonian thanks,btohqsg
must be harmonious in ur house then,btohqsg
To be fair Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are all Newtons laws in a different form,btohqsg
and makes solving certain types of questions much easier,btohqsg
Hamiltonian is not energy when time derivative is not 0Lagrangian is easier to generalise to field theory,btohqsg
Spinor field and bilinear forms go brrrrr,btohqsg
Also in fairness  I haven’t had to use either in a while,btohqsg
ok why r we entering stage 4 cancer,btohqsg
Also the gamma matrices not being representation independent still hurts my head,btohqsg
the way I got taught classical mechanics wasn’t great tbh,btohqsg
feel like I didn’t get a good view of things,btohqsg
had to really drill things in my own time,btohqsg
Yea my supervisor was telling me how NTUs quantum mechanics undergrad syllabus is severely lacking,btohqsg
cos how many r actually going into quantum,btohqsg
Quantum engineering programme is paid for by Prime Ministers office so uhhhh not sure what's up with your statement,btohqsg
resources to dive into actual quantum research,btohqsg
my stipend is under this lol,btohqsg
Singapore is one of the biggest quantum computing hubs in the world,btohqsg
There’s actually a lot of resources going into quantum tech,btohqsg
And I mean any physics research is gonna make use of quantum mechanics,btohqsg
sg doesnt even have a single nobel laureate,btohqsg
Idk about every field but quantum tech research is pretty well regarded internationally,btohqsg
I mean this is really not a good measure of how good research is in a country,btohqsg
that’s expecting all research to be some insane groundbreaking publication,btohqsg
the budget isnt that high either?,btohqsg
dude usa defence budget alone is 2x sg gdp,btohqsg
i like how you talked abt research n gdp and my project is researching on these 2 topics and data plotting it..,btohqsg
yah cos budget quite significantly affects how much can be done,btohqsg
Yea but it’s spread across so many different areas,btohqsg
like u rly rly cannot compare,btohqsg
The main thing is Singapore is very picky on what they allocate resources to,btohqsg
no i was just dumb and chose to do my data plotting on RnD vs employment.. and my prof said to add 1 more  and my friend gave me GDP..,btohqsg
and you really cannot use this to say sg does not have the resources for research,btohqsg
a quick google search shows sg is about 5bil/year,btohqsg
Esp since my initial point was the undergrad curriculum …,btohqsg
Which has nothing to do with the research,btohqsg
generally  not many people wld actually require indepth knowledge of quantum mech  so a rough idea shld be enuf,btohqsg
this applies to all areas of sg education,btohqsg
unless ur telling me ppl chose to specialise in a quantum mech course? or smt liddat,btohqsg
and the syllabus is still insufficient,btohqsg
it's not about the rough idea. it is actually pretty fundamental stuff that gets left behind at times,btohqsg
nobody needs to know the fundamental stuff tho,btohqsg
uh yea you do for quantum mech,btohqsg
you can't do a lot of specialised courses,btohqsg
quantum mech is as fundamental as newton's laws,btohqsg
pocoyo is back and shit there's a srs convo so byebye,btohqsg
Reminds me of when they chionged into life sciences,btohqsg
yes  but what careers do the ppl learning it take up?,btohqsg
if so  how many ppl wld actually go into quantum?,btohqsg
ok let me try to be a bit clearer,btohqsg
again  its about what the course is supposed to cover,btohqsg
"if its just like ""intro to quantum""",btohqsg
the fundamentals doesnt need to be clear,btohqsg
for people that don't intent on pursuing a career in physics  you literally don't need anything other than the math lol,btohqsg
for people that want to do something in physics,btohqsg
you need quantum mechanics to a certain level  or you cannot do anything,btohqsg
Pretty sure it's a core for physics and chem majors,btohqsg
yah then u cant fault them,btohqsg
compulsory. but what they do teach you skips over a lot of important stuff that you actually need to do the higher level classes (many of which are necessary too btw)  and when you get there  you end up hand waving your way through the course just to do the work,btohqsg
this is like faulting h2 physics for not going indepth into uni stuff,btohqsg
and then struggle through the next course again,btohqsg
because you don't have the fundamentals,btohqsg
ppl who arent doing physics in uni dont need it,btohqsg
if ur interested  self learning is the best,btohqsg
you literally need quantum mechanics to that level to do any year 3 onwards coursework,btohqsg
but they don't give that knowledge,btohqsg
All i can say for this is... OWADIO,btohqsg
except everyone is using it in the next sem  whether you get taught it or not,btohqsg
Ok remb bring life jacket and don't go under deck,btohqsg
its like f=ma getting taught in sec sch,btohqsg
the amount of time you need to self study this almost exceeds the time you'd spend on the new course itself,btohqsg
the sg system focuses on testing lots of different things,btohqsg
chill dont scared siyan is a nice guy,btohqsg
i don't have a problem with the professors. they decide in my faculty what they want to cover,btohqsg
"there was a big ""fight"" between two professors because one of them wanted to cut smth out of the syllabus",btohqsg
werent u saying its lack of depth to cover all bases,btohqsg
Basically saying the prof that decided how much content to put in isn't enough for the next module,btohqsg
yes  and that partly comes from not knowing what others are covering or need,btohqsg
the course coordinator decides what they wanna teach,btohqsg
as long as it gets approved  that's how it'll go,btohqsg
i know this because my PhD supervisor is the one that got mad at the removal,btohqsg
Ya  that's why I never recommend taking senior notes always  coz once the teaching prof changes  this content changes,btohqsg
Then your notes can shred already,btohqsg
with the introduction of NTU's ICC (gen ed) curriculum,btohqsg
2 more physics core modules got cut out completely,btohqsg
just be built diff bruh no need for notes,btohqsg
i mean u still can see  but learning isnt just reading your senior's notes so..,btohqsg
they somehow remove statistical mechanics 1  but statistical mechanics 2 isn't changed,btohqsg
so i wonder how that's gonna go,btohqsg
See is still can lah but just be prepared you need to do your own notes at the end of the day,btohqsg
Unfortunately some people want to use it as easy way out,btohqsg
also regarding the research thing  I obviously agree that USA/Europe has wayy more budget  but the budget to research output quality ratio does not tally,btohqsg
Singapore's research is so centered on specific fields and attracting talent all over the world,btohqsg
it's the only reason NUS and NTU are even ranked highly,btohqsg
and this is only in recent years,btohqsg
The Nobel Prize thing is also a bad argument considering people get awarded them decades after their defining work,btohqsg
i mean i write my own notes so,btohqsg
and it's only seen as defining much later,btohqsg
Singapore's research hasn't even matured to the point where we have findings like that yet,btohqsg
like the most recent 2022 prize was based on experiments from the 1980s,btohqsg
and yet SG's quantum tech scene quality wise is seen as one of the top in the world  alongside places like UC berkeley  oxford and harvard. obviously we aren't super crazy good  but there's a lot more to how good the research is outside of budget and nobel prizes,btohqsg
isnt this cos of... intl students,btohqsg
tbh it's more about the faculty they attract because sg pays professors and postdocs quite well compared to many other countries,btohqsg
and what that does is boost big collaborations,btohqsg
it's also a weird thing NUS and NTU have where they hardly ever hire faculty that don't have overseas experience  so you have to work overseas before you can be hired,btohqsg
One of the profs for NTU chem took his PhD under NTU as well but he's sent to Stanford for training,btohqsg
one of the few exceptions i've seen is the prof alr having an insane publication record,btohqsg
high h-index after just a few years,btohqsg
the iupac pres h-index is 64 or sth 💀 god tier,btohqsg
20 is good  40 is already fantastic   anything above 50 is just...,btohqsg
I think NTU recently started a plasma physics group,btohqsg
and the head they brought in has like 70+,btohqsg
h-index. just a measure of how good of a researcher you are,btohqsg
I stopped reading at '... I have started making out..' I'm sorry aryhur plz don't whack me,btohqsg
Lol ok I will rephrase it I sounds weird,btohqsg
In simpler terms I have started creating a pdf file which will contain the cop for all the pfp courses (for Na peeps only )*Cop are Estimated only*,btohqsg
This is because the polys don't produce cops for the polytechnic foundation programme so this would help ppl better gauge which course they can get into,btohqsg
Hope y'all get into your desired poly course and don't react with any emogi TQ!,btohqsg
I want to show my love and support,btohqsg
I react to show my love to dajie,btohqsg
NTU and NUS striving to be SMU while SMU striving to be NUS,btohqsg
More rigour or smth last i heard,btohqsg
And yep it shld be done before the results are being released .,btohqsg
as in born and raised in sg nobel laurette,btohqsg
This year's physics nobel prize was good research but wasn't groundbreaking,btohqsg
2 years ago lazer tweezing was ground breaking,btohqsg
Do you know what's good research but isn't Nobel Laureate material? Explaining away the hairless blackhole paradox,btohqsg
y am i experiencing double vision,btohqsg
shld i be concerned abt this,btohqsg
I mean there’s many possible reasons,btohqsg
ok mr physics do ur biology,btohqsg
Do we look like opticians to u,btohqsg
Ok but like DOES ANYBODY KNOW THI,btohqsg
do u currently have any internal bleeding or,btohqsg
I dont rlly wanna hear frm google,btohqsg
or ur retina has officially died on u,btohqsg
it cld be the fovea  where the image is clearest  but since u experience double vision it cld be combination of damaged nerves along ur retina and damage to lens,btohqsg
this is based on whatever 50 iq brain I have,btohqsg
but srsly note get it check tmr if it persist.. I might be due to migraines whatsoever,btohqsg
get some rest don't look at ur phone requires u to squint and all not good,btohqsg
lai pm me your address 😈,btohqsg
tbf still one of a number of buildings,btohqsg
true  but you know where exactly 💀,btohqsg
hey I didn’t even ask you for it,btohqsg
this is gonna be useful for me next year,btohqsg
Anyone here got amazing design skills 😭 i need help 😢,btohqsg
Design in what? I mean design in product I have cuz I take dnt,btohqsg
Oh i mean design a poster 😭,btohqsg
Coz i have no design skills 😭,btohqsg
First time u wld ever wake up early,btohqsg
what if I dress as pocoyo to afa,btohqsg
The word document which contains the cut off points for polytechnic foundation programme courses will be ready earliest by this Friday,btohqsg
Nyp I done already I also need to let my pfp friends check and sch teachers before I will post,btohqsg
I genuinely would appreciate killing my laptop rn.,btohqsg
give me I help you kill it,btohqsg
Because the wifi isn’t letting me even enter into it.,btohqsg
Apparently Singapore has the best wifi speeds on average in the world,btohqsg
I need to drown myself in tequila. Rn. Stat.,btohqsg
There are better choices of alcohol,btohqsg
I’ve always wanted to try infusing stuff into vodka,btohqsg
O thats p good too yea,btohqsg
how does one have good fashion sense 💀,btohqsg
J hv a good figure n anything u wear looks good,btohqsg
Learn from the French   Korean & Japanese if you mean the type of clothes to wear.,btohqsg
Avg korean fashion sense not the best,btohqsg
Their street wear is a worse version of chinese street wear imo,btohqsg
I have to beg to differ I look bad rn,btohqsg
I can't wear shorts or revealing which is   pain.,btohqsg
I look like I'm dressed like a minah,btohqsg
The best I’ve dressed for every day stuff is when I went to Europe,btohqsg
I look like a Malay dressed as a PRC HHAHAHA,btohqsg
Weather in sg limits a lot,btohqsg
Socks and sandals to be precise,btohqsg
Ya fr.  Can't layer which makes outfits look slack af,btohqsg
Lol I don't even dress I always wear slippers shirt and shorts,btohqsg
Even when going orchard or smth,btohqsg
I mean I’ve gotten used to wearing jacket in sg,btohqsg
then I wear thin button shirts outside at times too,btohqsg
I want to rock jackets but i cant,btohqsg
I...can barely handle cotton shirts in SG,btohqsg
at least in uni still can cos I’m usually in ac places,btohqsg
Then when I wear long pants,btohqsg
Do your pants fit well tho,btohqsg
I only have one fit that,btohqsg
LAWLS PLS THIS COMPARED TO THE SCREWDRIVER IN THE EAR,btohqsg
Does it work for vodka peach?,btohqsg
If only i had vanilla pods,btohqsg
hello  does anyone have bio tys mcq answers with explanations from school?,btohqsg
I’m just putting a name on bill saying his outfit is skin,btohqsg
Only certain people gets the honour of context.,btohqsg
Go to random clothing stores n try out clothes in fitting rooms,btohqsg
Get a rich friend who can buy you clothes,btohqsg
When do they ever actually do that,btohqsg
Is that a generic question or directed towards someone specifically,btohqsg
I know some people that would and do,btohqsg
so I'm at my future sch nus. JOKING AH RELAX PLZ,btohqsg
I’m really jealous of your closet then.,btohqsg
nah I have turned them down multiple times,btohqsg
their money would be wasted on me,btohqsg
actually I’m not but I’m perfectly content with wearing a small variety of things,btohqsg
who knows thanks to ur help..,btohqsg
I’m sure that’s going to end well.,btohqsg
i think im more of a disaster than u,btohqsg
I can learn while waiting for my results,btohqsg
maybe a bit more context on what you’re looking for,btohqsg
This close to singing take a hint to you.,btohqsg
to both comp engi and science,btohqsg
Do you know any coding yet,btohqsg
I need to learn or gg,btohqsg
ok go find a basic online course to python then,btohqsg
I am guessing they will teach in the notes,btohqsg
I mean there’s notes but the best way to learn any form of programming is by doing,btohqsg
notes is good for theory stuff that may be good to know,btohqsg
Actually yea coursera like what Bedok said LOL,btohqsg
Find like a basic python course,btohqsg
Exactly. I don’t understand why more people don’t use it.,btohqsg
iirc you can’t get certification without paying but many of them can still do the work and stuff?,btohqsg
As an NTU student I get a ton of certificates for free heh,btohqsg
And tbh if you just search “basic python online course free” or smth,btohqsg
But Coursera is mainly taught by actual professionals,btohqsg
Unless your guardian has the subscription membership for it,btohqsg
I’d rather you just take the hint.,btohqsg
Sorry ah you got phd in comp,btohqsg
uh you dont learn by reading notes,btohqsg
yeah I dont know what to do alright,btohqsg
Thats why I am asking yall,btohqsg
He doesnt have to be sarcastic right,btohqsg
so you dont bother to listen to an actual suggestion  to which a comp science major has alr mentioned  he just happened to remention it,btohqsg
"doesnt mean hes not in comp science means he doesnt have the memory of yesterday where i mentioned ""datacamp"" and ""coursera""",btohqsg
"dont shut people down just because they dont reply ""nicely""",btohqsg
hes tryna help but youre calling him toxic so 🤷🏻‍♀,btohqsg
I would obv pick up his advice,btohqsg
its basic manners to listen to people's suggestions as well and not repeat the same question you and others have asked literally a day ago,btohqsg
Theres no need to be rude,btohqsg
do you expect us to not be tired that we have to repeat our statement just because someone did not take note of our response? werent even rude and even if you considered his response to be rude  at least he helped. doesnt mean everyone has to be all bubbly in response for you to absorb,btohqsg
I will shut up now gwyn tell me 🥲🥲,btohqsg
I am not chronically online  I dont remember,btohqsg
if you have that mindset  youre going into university expecting every lecturer to me smiling and kind  do you really expect to learn in that environment? stop assuming everyone will be spoon feeding you the knowledge if youre just gonna shutdown just because you cant take in a little bit of annoyance,btohqsg
Is it so hard to be nice,btohqsg
"not everyone has to live up to what you consider as ""nice""",btohqsg
You considered Bedok’s sass to be rude? He is less harsh than I am.,btohqsg
"if you want to get into uni with the mindset that every student will help you with a smile on their face  and you start shutting people out just because they ""are not nice to you"" then trust me  some of the best students will not help you. you go in with the closed off mindset that ""oh hes rude im gonna shut him down"" youre not gonna get any feedback or responses. doesnt mean that you expect people to be kindhearted means that they will always help you. we all have our own lives and we are taking the damn time to help you thru our busy days and your response is ""hes rude im gonna shut him out""then really think again  whether youre coming here for actual advice and feedback  or just expecting the ""nice ones"" to spoon feed you with the resources because you cant do your own research about it.",btohqsg
Whats this group for? Berating and looking down on people who are new to courses and need help,btohqsg
You know many people told me the groups pretty toxic,btohqsg
we dont even look down on you  we are literally providing you with the resources and you choose to shut bedok out just because you thought he was rude,btohqsg
Its not a one time thing,btohqsg
Ouhh how can you not know this,btohqsg
sarcasm is prevalent  but it does not mean rudeness.,btohqsg
People message me abt it too,btohqsg
But in this chat it’s more casual,btohqsg
but yes tldr use online resources,btohqsg
It’s a good skill for uni anyway,btohqsg
you will run into situations where just using the materials given by your profs may not be enough,btohqsg
so you find online stuff to supplement,btohqsg
Also for coding: learn to use stack exchange,btohqsg
My friend told me data structures and algorithms are very hard,btohqsg
Its the place with codes right,btohqsg
It’s a forum where people ask questions about their code,btohqsg
Most questions you can think of asking,btohqsg
Likely a similar one has been asked before,btohqsg
I think it may be the theory of it but yea it’s a fundamental part,btohqsg
Could read up on it too,btohqsg
knowing math well helps in certain areas too  esp data science and AI,btohqsg
The only reason why Reddit is still existent.,btohqsg
Three branches of math I’d focus on are statistics  calculus and linear algebra,btohqsg
So I will learn python and other languages and see from there,btohqsg
Python is like the most used language and is quite beginner friendly imo,btohqsg
You can do almost anything with it just that it’s not specialised in something,btohqsg
Should I buy mods from carrousell,btohqsg
ok html is easy as a markup language but most people don’t see it as coding,btohqsg
nah don’t waste your money rn,btohqsg
online is more than enough for the time being,btohqsg
is this for specific courses? or just all courses in general,btohqsg
coming from comp sci  can speak for it  definitely some errors that lecturers may never have hit because you were doing something to improve your codes that they may not have done  but not sure abt the rest of the fields,btohqsg
I’m interested in doing psych which i think at the same time is prob heavily researched and essay based?,btohqsg
okie thanks! maybe I’ll just see what happens when i enter uni,btohqsg
Hii!! does anyone know anything about how Loyang view secondary/Springfield secondary/ tampines secondary/ changkat secondary. Asking for a friend. :),btohqsg
it's a general statement. uni profs give lectures and materials to learn from  but to get a full understanding  you usually have to spend time combing through stuff like textbooks  online sites  etc on your own. slides/notes given don't go in depth enough,btohqsg
for psych  it's likely a combination of theory notes + a ton of readings for illustration,btohqsg
but it's still good to know how to look up more should you need it,btohqsg
more technical stuff for psych would be quite a bit of statistics too,btohqsg
u have 2020 and 2021 and those years from older syllabus?,btohqsg
uhhh i only have 2020 and some older years,btohqsg
ahh if dont mind can send?,btohqsg
pocoyo said fuck the ikea manual and create her own hole using a screwdriver,btohqsg
gl to u if I somehow engineer ur aircraft,btohqsg
I’ll be sure to avoid that plane,btohqsg
I got there with help from u,btohqsg
gonna duct tape the wings because you can’t figure it out,btohqsg
That is arguably just as bad,btohqsg
dude my dad was a party freak,btohqsg
the best is yet to come,btohqsg
I have watched 3 animes worked out studied code,btohqsg
How do I get myself to do wor,btohqsg
happy bday to anyone in this gc,btohqsg
I have made the resolution to not waste anymore of my energy or time on interacting with Joel.,btohqsg
I did all the tys alr,btohqsg
Right. Anyways I am pocoyo's mom,btohqsg
So  I’ll not participate with any banter involving him,btohqsg
yeah but very easy dont what the book is for,btohqsg
like teh average person would find it easy,btohqsg
How anticlimactic. I could do that when I was 8.,btohqsg
I mean I did too in sec school,btohqsg
I achieved that in coding when I was 8 within like a half an hour.,btohqsg
You can help me do research,btohqsg
I made a nerf gun from sticks when I was 8,btohqsg
Just get my pushy overachieving family and my never ending hunger in curiosity.,btohqsg
Not the best joke you’ve made SY.,btohqsg
It’s just an excuse to use the cursed sticker pack,btohqsg
singapore govt should use this for advertisemnet,btohqsg
What is it on? Why couldn’t you have asked me? I’m offended. >:(,btohqsg
Also isn’t hello world literally the first thing you learn in a language,btohqsg
Worst language in the world is Java tho,btohqsg
why do u not like my public static void main(String[] args),btohqsg
Hold up I’ll show it in a bit,btohqsg
Should’ve just learnt more basic languages,btohqsg
Python is a good one to start tho,btohqsg
Just be my younger self who found it fun to learn to code at 8.,btohqsg
Personally I wouldn’t start with a compiled language,btohqsg
Isn’t it your entire life then dude,btohqsg
You’re suicidally an imbecile  through and through.,btohqsg
Then my dad told them I got a bad engineering course in nus and said I had to retake,btohqsg
Know how to kick people when they're down,btohqsg
that's an asshole thing to save,btohqsg
