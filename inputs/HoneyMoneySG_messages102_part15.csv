When purchasing t-bills  you need to select a source of funds  be it cash/SRS/CPF OA/CPF SA. Assuming you choose CPF OA and there's not enough funds in CPFIA then the bank will withdraw fresh funds from your OA account to fund your investment,btohqsg
Say you want to invest 10k in in t-bills and only have 7k in CPFIA then bank will withdraw another 3k from your OA to fund for your t-bills,btohqsg

When you put a comma and next word  I will link the two statements üôÉ,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt seem that hard to understand ü§î,btohqsg
Ppl will have different way to interpret. That why words can be easily mis constructed.,btohqsg
Just put at least a day before premium due then don't have to worry. Cardup will also do their part to send payment early.,btohqsg
You can check CardUp's faq to see what cards are eligible for rewards. But the best is to check the card's t&c.,btohqsg
