I am new to trading.Read up a little. I unfortunately missed the dateline of 5th May and thus am now eyeing the sale of the excess renounceable rights  (or nil-paid shares) on the open market which will start on 13 May on a different counter than C6L (I think starts from R something).My questions are:1. If I buy the rights issue on 13 May and say it is priced at 4.30 SGD (price before 5th May) - 3 SGD = 1.30 SGD  I still have to cough up another $3 after I bought the rights issue on SGX? Payment is via what  ATM?1. If the price was about 4.30 SGD in the days before 5th May  and lets say someone buys 2000 shares  and subscribes fully to a further 3000 shares at 3.00 SGD. This means total shares = 5k shares  and total money pumped in is $17.6k. Therefore  the price per share is about $3.52. This means that if the Rights Issue price drops to $0.50 and I bought it  and then pay a further $3  I am in as good a position as the entitled shareholder??3. How will the price movement be over the 7 days? Do you think people will rush to grab the renounceable excess rights?Thanks!,btohqsg
