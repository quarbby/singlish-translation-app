that's why it's recommended to try and familiarise yourself with a bus route,btohqsg
the area of where you know you need to go to & fro,btohqsg
pay too much attention on something else,btohqsg
gets bored if the route is too long,btohqsg
like when you are gg to a new school  moving to a new housing estate  an unfamiliar town area you might need to frequently go to,btohqsg
be aware of which routes can lead you back to your own area of residence,btohqsg
usually just focus on the road routes first,btohqsg
don't bother so much about the bus journey itself,btohqsg
i can memorize the bus 39 route by heart now,btohqsg
i don't normally go to Yishun,btohqsg
i memorize east west line next time downtown line ðŸ¤–,btohqsg
i normally head down to yishun just to take a direct bus down to bugis ðŸŒš,btohqsg
me when i had arcade urges,btohqsg
i hate half of mrt and half of bus,btohqsg
mrt fares tear a greater hole on my family's financial ability to cope with monthly expenses,btohqsg
i promised not to take north south line again,btohqsg
Damnnnn MY BODY CLOCK IS DEFO NOT FUNCTIONING,btohqsg
my parents was sad the shops at the end was closed because their friend work there,btohqsg
that happens whenever existing establishments have to make room for further town development,btohqsg
no its hard to remember somewhere that i have went when i was only 2 years,btohqsg
but mcdonald will always be there,btohqsg
the only thing that mcdonalds have started to phase out in sg,btohqsg
oh  and their 24/7 operating hours businesses,btohqsg
I rmb eating macdonalds whenever i finish national service duty though,btohqsg
actually it feels like mcd is the common choice to eat for students & NSFs,btohqsg
What time is mcdonald breakfast now uh hahahahaha,btohqsg
I rmb like the mcdonald app has games and you get deals also,btohqsg
okay tampines mcdonald was never drive thru,btohqsg
common choice is to skip breakfast,btohqsg
actually do you mean the new concourse or the one that closed that is ulu?,btohqsg
coz the new concourse int barely has any updated information anywhere,btohqsg
the old concourse seems like it's still in use  but no,btohqsg
it's just another so-called depot place for buses,btohqsg
plus a lot of training bus routes are done from there,btohqsg
i had to wait at least 30 minutes from tamp concourse,btohqsg
might as well take another bus,btohqsg
used to be 3 but 2 moved to the temporary tampines north bus interchange,btohqsg
might as well shift out like how compassvale bus int  is no longer a thing..,btohqsg
the bus interchange near to sengkang int,btohqsg
tampines north temp bus int will close in the future like compassvale,btohqsg
isn't that supposed to be tampines concourse instead,btohqsg
"cuz even tho sg town areas bus interchanges has the additional term of ""temp(orary)""  it's just a way of wording it longer",btohqsg
cuz normally u also have bus stops outside bus interchange,btohqsg
so that's mostly to avoid confusion,btohqsg
maybe they will put all the buses at there later,btohqsg
coz i think the government also acknowledges that tampines definitely need redevelopment lol,btohqsg
so many residents but the facilities and services are so mesy,btohqsg
i think they do it by order first tho,btohqsg
damn i spent the past hour on youtube and youâ€™re still chatting,btohqsg
or maybe it's more of which town the sg gov will give priority over,btohqsg
