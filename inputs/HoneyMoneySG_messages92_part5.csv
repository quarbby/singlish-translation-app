AHA! i was waiting for someone to ask this!If you are at a computer terminal (eg. LAN cafe) and you buy something  you need to OTP it how?,btohqsg
In most situations  it is more like you have internet/wifi but no reception,btohqsg
Amaze feels so too  so they send OTP to both SMS and Email.,btohqsg
Hi guru  is it worth to buy those condo in JB which are walking distance to RTS?,btohqsg
oops i'm sorry i replied to the wrong text haha. meant to reply to Sofyan,btohqsg
the need for OTP is set by merchant.idk that the type of OTP is set by merchant but i guess its possible. like citibank cards uses the app for authentication. In fact  i prefer app rather than SMS as some of us switched SIM card when travel and can't receive that SMS unless we switch back to SG SIM card,btohqsg
I dont change Citi too  I dont see the need  but I change for UOB and OCBC,btohqsg
Any recommendation for fixed deposit for tenure of 12 months to 24 months,btohqsg

Normally I have a hotspot phone if travel overseas,btohqsg

Hello! Wld like to check with all gurus here. Does paying for utility bills count towards the $600 for DBS Live Fresh?,btohqsg

Hi  for converting sgd to usd in IBKR. Wld you say that the min amount recommended to convert at a time is about $520++ based on currency conversion charge?,btohqsg
Can consider buying vouchers on wogi.,btohqsg
Cos I think one card have discount at caltex.,btohqsg
But you won't hit minimum spend to get bonus cashback or cashback on either cards.,btohqsg
Make payment singtel or M1 bill using your credit card,btohqsg
depends which cards  can try get the bonus points/rebate while still meeting the min spend. Can buy vouchers on shopback/wogi  pay bill on singtel/m1/starhub website/app  topup pandapay  buy fairprice egiftcard etc,btohqsg
but then u still need to meet the monthly min $500/$600 spend on uob one/evol to get bonus rebate,btohqsg
Bro how many months you splitting ah. You got notice you never get any rebate if you had not been hitting the minimum qualifying spent for each card,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt split yet. So my question is do I need to spend 500 on one of the cards or I can split it up,btohqsg
can split for bonus interest but will not get bonus rebate if u did not meet min spend for each card,btohqsg

Can I check if anyone knows I apply HSBC now straight away can use the virtual card for transactions?,btohqsg
When I applied back in 2022  HSBC took 5 weeks to process and sent me my revo card. Not sure if the process is any faster now,btohqsg
Think it's better to apply for other bank cards if you need to use urgently,btohqsg
yes have virtual card  i just applied last month . got virtual card details before even receiving physical card. I am using HSBC revo,btohqsg
my process for HSBC is instantly  using singpass but the limit is low,btohqsg
most banks nowadays are almost instant IF you have been working for 3 months  ++ (CPF credited 3 times?) salary above the minimum amount of 30k and using SINGPASS and obviously Credit as assigned by the bank,btohqsg
reach birthday date already? they say on your 55th Bithday. not by year.,btohqsg
I applied revo immediate approved and can use virtual card via singpass.Applied t1 using singpass  didnt get immediate approval  need wait 3 to 4 days and virtual card appears in app,btohqsg
the limit from singpass still ok... depends bank? some banks give 10k  some 20k  then recent cards are 30k....but when i try to review limit for 20k card.. they added $200 only.. -.-,btohqsg
Can I know how to invest in money market bonds?,btohqsg
once CPF hit BHS and FRS... all funds into SA and MA will be channel into OA?,btohqsg
5 min to Singsaver playstation 5 promo!https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/174576,btohqsg
Seems to be so for age 55 onwards,btohqsg
seems like MA hit BHS will auto transfer... but SA... SA after FRS still can compound. Cuz one of your video saying 31% into OA (included MA portion) but didnt mention on SA. so curious about the SA,btohqsg
