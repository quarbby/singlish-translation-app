anyone knows which grc is hougang citrine under? cant tell if its marine parade or aljunid,btohqsg
yea its like at the border thats why wondering. not sure which grc MP to go to to appeal for stuff,btohqsg
If ure considering Bayshore  listen to this,btohqsg
Actually it‚Äôs more of the salt on the air that one should be concerned about  because salt is corrosive,btohqsg
Yea apply now get HFE can appeal to get it revise later,btohqsg
do these appeals actually go through? for the EHG grant. becasue it states need to be working continuously 12mths prior.,btohqsg
EHG grant - theyre quite strict about the continuous 12months of employment  but you‚Äôll never know unless you appeal haha,btohqsg
HFE can be revised at a later time? For HDB loan amount?,btohqsg
I was suggested that from hdb,btohqsg
God bless. That's a good news.,btohqsg
But again that is the appeal process,btohqsg
Took me 2 Mon to reach that process,btohqsg
God knows how long they will take to revise the loan amount,btohqsg
this EHG when you sell still need to pay back to cpf? or is it totally wipe off the sale amount?,btohqsg
The ehg will back of your cpf,btohqsg
So it will return to your cpf,btohqsg
The appeal process must be completed before 1st appointment? Or is there a window period?,btohqsg
lets say bto cost 200k EHG 20k. so now full sum payable is 180k? loan repayment all only on 180k?  or is it when u sell need to pay back additional 20k to cpf? like a super long deferred payment? are all grant super long deferred payments? is there interet on these grants?,btohqsg
bto cost 200kehg 20k20% downpayment 40kloan: 140kwhen sell the house  need to pay back 20k + accrued interest back to cpf,btohqsg
See my Example below:BTO cost - 200kEHG - 20kDownpayment - 30kYou can use the 20k to pay for the downpayment. The remaining 10k you can pay with cash/CPFYour loan currently will be 170k.When you sell for maybe 250k250k - remaining loan (e.g. 100k)  you are left with 150kAssuming you use 50k from your CPF (downpayment (which is inclusive of your EHG) plus monthly mortgage)  this amount will go back to your CPFRemaining 100k cash will be credited to your bank account.,btohqsg
There is interest on the grant because the grant is credited into your CPF OA which should‚Äôve been earning 2.5%  hence you need to deduct the principal and accrued interest used,btohqsg
anybody knows Toa Payoh showroom is open today or tomorrow to view the 3D models of BTO at the public area?,btohqsg
hello  i recently applied for a bto but forgot to tick the mcps option however managed to send an email to hdb a day after the application closure.. anyone in the same boat also asking to edit application? ://,btohqsg
Hi is there any altura ec chats?,btohqsg
Hi. May I check what's the difference between Estimated Waiting Time vs. Estimated TOP Date?In recent Dec 23 BTO launch  looking at Sin Min Residences Project as an example  Estimated Waiting Time is 32 mths (at about Aug-2026 starting from now) but Estimated TOP date from BTOHQ page is Jun-2027.That's about 10 months difference.Other projects also have similar differences.,btohqsg
That 32 months start from median of flat selection period.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check where can find how many ballots have people ballots for the BTO,btohqsg
As long as they amend before ballot can but their email. So slow high chance ur ballot won't be under mcps,btohqsg
Should've just cancel and redo  $10 only for the piece of mind,btohqsg
Cause ballot starts right after closing of the date...,btohqsg
How can we access the BTO project details?,btohqsg
The flat dashboard only shows upcoming projects...,btohqsg
Do you mean projects you applied for previously?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check is the models open to everyone view? Or need to book appointment,btohqsg
The one where we can view the titles,btohqsg
These and most of the project 3D models are not open to the public  you need an appointment,btohqsg
