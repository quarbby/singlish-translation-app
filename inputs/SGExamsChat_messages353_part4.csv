Anyone knw how to memorise for geog with like nothing inside the brain in like a week :/,btohqsg
Subject specific. My belief is that for maths  do primarily prelims while doing a bit of TYS. There are some good questions in the TYS  but majority are easier.For Physics  do primarily TYS because the database questions are more well set. There are also more graph questions.,btohqsg
guys will attendance affect scholarship chances? i feel studying at home is more productive instead of going to school just to go through a few questions,btohqsg
most likely yes cos for the interviews i went with my friends some got rejected simply cos the interviewer thinks they may not be fully committed to the course cos of their attendance,btohqsg
