hi how to resolve sql error,btohqsg
like when I try to upload something to the uni matriculation portal it says sql error,btohqsg
does it give more information on the sql error?,btohqsg
double check what you submitted whether it fits the specifications,btohqsg
if not means their backend fked up alr,btohqsg
because it’s hard or easy ?,btohqsg
And there’s hardly any maths in it which is quite a large part of physics,btohqsg
Hardest math you use in jc physics is like cosine rule,btohqsg
The hardest calculus is pretty much counting squares under the graph,btohqsg
I don't see much high math in JC/High school physics,btohqsg
Even for undergrad  most things are magick-handwave to become linear,btohqsg
Not saying that quadratics would be easy though,btohqsg
By this I mean globally btw,btohqsg
I dont think high school physics need use calculus,btohqsg
Yeah I not much sure any other thing  but possibly got  but if you know any of those you are into the deep end already,btohqsg
Got use linear algebra and multivar de uni physics,btohqsg
Fluid dynamics use multivar. Vibration use linear al,btohqsg
Solving for forces in structure also use linear algebra,btohqsg
ya laplace but not all that hard,btohqsg
Wow wow wow you took functional analysis alr?,btohqsg
All of these come under 'special functions ' since they are just diff eqns/diff eqn solns,btohqsg
Functional analysis is level 4k mod,btohqsg
Does it really matter what level it is,btohqsg
Under prof Gan Wee Teck it was Super hard apparently,btohqsg
A year ago it was by denny leung,btohqsg
I lucky sia I almost wanted to take LOl in the end I just took Topo,btohqsg
TBH till today I have no fking clue what is a Topological Insulator,btohqsg
There was one lesson he tried to prove Ascoli Theorem and everyone didn’t understand it and gave up lmao,btohqsg
At least he got no accent,btohqsg
Are you like year 1 NUS,btohqsg
is ascoli's theorem arzela-ascoli or smth different,btohqsg
i'll wait until i take topo before i scare myself further,btohqsg
Suddenly a lot of maths majors here,btohqsg
Math is too hard to understand,btohqsg
No need all the esoteric topics,btohqsg
