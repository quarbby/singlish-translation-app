Xenon has been typing a novel,btohqsg
"OK so recently I noted two cool things in paradesIn parades  there will usually be a ""colour party"" that holds the colours (flags) representing the contingents/units/groups/whatever.Whenever the parade hormats (salute) someone  only the appropriate colours will be lowered. Eg if you're saluting chief of army  you don't lower the national colours  but if you hormat the president then all colours are supposed to go down.Second cool thing is that when someone is being hormat'd right  there will be different songs playing to signify the kind of honour given. Idk the name of the songs  but usually it's just a short 10 sec jingle. Eg chief of army/navy/Air force gets a song  chief of defence force gets another song  prime minister gets another song.The interesting part (to me) is that the song for the president is the national song  so the hormat lasts for like 2 mins",btohqsg
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk,btohqsg
I find parades really interesting tbh,btohqsg
So in NDP  there's no segment to play the national song,btohqsg
Cause when people welcome the president the national song will be played,btohqsg
You hormat with your sword tho,btohqsg
there are 7 salute tunes for different rankings,btohqsg
the salute tune for the president is the national anthem,btohqsg
haha ya but i only rmb playing salute 2 and 6,btohqsg
I wanted a list of marches also,btohqsg
I would think that salute 6 and 7 would be more common,btohqsg
bold of you to assume we all take physics,btohqsg
do you know what is salute 1 used for,btohqsg
hv no clue but the comment says president inauguration,btohqsg
I'd imagine it be used other places too,btohqsg
can't be the president come to any parade and then suddenly need play national song,btohqsg
... or maybe that's why the president only joins the ndp lol,btohqsg
Ability to deal with my shit,btohqsg

Anyone who calls Mathematics 'Maths' is untrustworthy,btohqsg
and almost 98.98% not a mathematician.,btohqsg
I recommend you publish in 2 journals,btohqsg
O wait btw the only other acceptable 'Mathematics' is Mathématiques,btohqsg
Make sure you accent that e,btohqsg
