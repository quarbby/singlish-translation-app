One more thing. Need to pay $40 for mile redemption per transfer unless you subscribe yearly n pay yearly.,btohqsg

Idunno...its public housing... Gotta live by govt rules... Otherwise it's condo,btohqsg
its like the whole system is assuming a lot of things to go smoothly for a young coupleâ€¦i.e. graduate at 22/24  after 5 years salary max out at 14k for the couple  just nice 27/29 can still have baby and thus a house is ready for u,btohqsg
Of coz mah  birth rate dropping so crazily  how can we incentivize singles,btohqsg
Looks like more than $14K income for resale can buy Standard and maybe Plus  no Prime.,btohqsg
Govt wants to be incentivising people to have kids  not singles who yolo,btohqsg
They are only limiting to those Prime HDB.. normal HDB no income ceiling restriction for resale,btohqsg
Previously singles are only limited to non-matured estate.. now no restrictions,btohqsg
Also hard to get those better location. Just bring hope only.,btohqsg
Guess they knew the single going to vote opposition party. Faster do it before 2025. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
At least they are building singles' flat there  last time only at ulu locations.. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Now 30plus I guess about 40% is single. I think they knew it is serious losing vote.ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
40%?!?!? Where got so much? Most people should be married by that age,btohqsg
We need to set up arranged marriages like in India  seems to work out for them  even though that is personal rather than govt sanctioned,btohqsg
Drastically Declining birth rate can mean the end of singapore,btohqsg
End of the world actually. universe 25 experiment,btohqsg
Eh for EGA Bonus interest do they pay it out in one shot?,btohqsg
