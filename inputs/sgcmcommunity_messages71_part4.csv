Here's a PSA:Please wear your seatbelt everybody (Even when you are just driving down the MSCP to below your block)ðŸ¥°-R,btohqsg
Whether in the front or the back,btohqsg

But he cares for your life Pak Imran,btohqsg
Yes because some blocks below have no road between mscp and the block itself. So can get quite bumpy ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Also Pak Imran  please look at what Zenvo did recently,btohqsg
But yes in all seriousness  seat belt is a must,btohqsg
Fun fact! There are times that not wearing a seatbelt helped someone survived an accident,btohqsg
speaking of which  what do yall think about using an ipad mini in the car?-R,btohqsg
Those instances are much fewer in numbers than when seatbelts saved people,btohqsg
The chances are low but never zero,btohqsg
Only when rolling down a mountain or into a river did not wearing a seatbelt help people quickly jump out,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll win the next oneâ€¦.right?,btohqsg
how do you mount it ah?,btohqsg
I would rather have a proper head unit with steering mounted controls or haptic feedback touch sensitive buttons to use than an ipad mini,btohqsg
powerrr. Yours is cellular + wifi or wifi only?-R,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the mounting behind that needs to be strong too,btohqsg
Can play movie on the move all,btohqsg
Still control only volume or next song only,btohqsg
So i bought the portable wifi device snd got a sim card with data only plan,btohqsg
Or you could just mobile hotspot from your phone,btohqsg
This was what I was thinking too AHHAHA-R,btohqsg
Not that bad  iphone to ipad still ok,btohqsg
the wifi device not expensive ah?-R,btohqsg
By buying another data plan instead of upgrading the only you already have,btohqsg
Like I can watch youtube or netflix without worrying about my data,btohqsg
Tomorrow then the netlix will on,btohqsg
Iâ€™d rather get an ipad anyways,btohqsg
Can use it for other things too,btohqsg
Then can say your car is Zenvo,btohqsg
