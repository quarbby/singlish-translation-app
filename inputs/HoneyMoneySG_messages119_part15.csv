Don't make sense. You have things like t-bills that gives way higher than accrued interest rates. Why would you pay back?,btohqsg
Have discussed over thousands of times after XNAP's freeze.AmexPay if QR supported  for AMEX-issued cards.UnionPay if QR supported  for bank issued UnionPay cards.#hawkerpay,btohqsg

Did you recently apply your Trust card? 🤣,btohqsg
Maybe my pay low they dun1 approved 😭,btohqsg

Hey all. Just recieved my UOB Krisflyer. Do I need to link the card to my krisflyer account or sth? 🤔,btohqsg
Should be linked already? There should be your Krisflyer number on the card,btohqsg
when I did it 2-3 ago there is a form to fill.,btohqsg
Unable to link my CRMC to amaze . Anyone can help,btohqsg
Check your UOB lady spending catergoy guys! Damn ridiculous! UOB CSO told me that there is a system update and my reward cat  will be revert back to my enrolment category in the next quarter.I was like what?!!Enrolled as dining fashionChanged to dining travel and this quarter ( dining travel)But next quarter revert back to dining fashion,btohqsg
When does your next quarter start?,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense to me because if I make the change to dining travel and system record as dining travel   it shld persists until I make another changesApparently it is not  she said there was a system change and the system captures a change to dining fashion today (so coincidental??!),btohqsg
Try again lo. Still got time  why panic?,btohqsg
Lol~ I am just informing that they will change the category without u knowing . U don’t panic when u suddenly spend without knowing they change lor,btohqsg
Anybody still keep the TnC of this Singsaver-Webull promo $2k earns $140 that was for Dec2023/Jan 2024 period?,btohqsg
Oh I thought hsbc 4.6% no other places can beat ma,btohqsg
Just do it and I believe we will all be pleasantly surprised. As long as don’t do stupid things like HSBC A to HSBC B back to HSBC A.,btohqsg
Yea I like ur positive vibe!! Banks are stupid!,btohqsg
Is the new UOB promo worth it with 5 months lock in ? 🤭,btohqsg
Approx 5.6% pa for 5.5 months lock-in.Also has the same danger clauses as HSBC EGA fyi.,btohqsg
At least u know if no earmark u u miss it instead of hsbc u wont really know until interest time,btohqsg
I think joining this UOB Promo is quite risky because UOB may half way cut the 4% interest to lower..,btohqsg
Another risk is any change of clause  the fund is locked for 5 months n cannot run away. Eg. Downward adjustment of interest  salary from company only  spend requirement increase  etc…,btohqsg
anyone can verify that ocbc365 card don't earn cashback on fast food mcc? I just went their website and got their latest t and c (dated March 2024) and it says it's included,btohqsg
It can happen to any bank  investment fund etc. Unless u all talking about ssb/tbills/fd. The chances of uob adjusting further so fast in a short time is not high unless they want to further lose more saver even before fed start to drop rate,btohqsg
Hi is there 7.7 for SQ flight tickets?,btohqsg
Sq not shopping platform 😂  all these 7.7  8.8 are marketing come up by platform.,btohqsg

Ya as per previously mentioned 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Guys is it true that citi credit card can be paid via dbs pay bill function now?,btohqsg
"Ok la ""i asked for it"" since i still empty out after the previous letter and successful appeal",btohqsg
You mean after warning  you continue playing the musical game?,btohqsg
I saw the citi credit card option under dbs bill payment today,btohqsg
But i see no reason why i should just parked my money like a good kid with them if i cant musical chair n get the most benefits out of it,btohqsg
I guess they just gave u a reason,btohqsg
So they stop your musical chair  coz they see no benefit to keep you as their customer loh😂,btohqsg
Which to me is not a reason. I dont mind losing them n they dun mind losing me so i just find it funny,btohqsg
