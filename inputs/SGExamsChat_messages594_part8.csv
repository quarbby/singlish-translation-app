For some reason ik 3 students who take BCMG  all 3 got A for B and G,btohqsg
Geog as a subject is q repetitive,btohqsg
I see two heavy content subject tgth,btohqsg
the lecture book is gonna be thicc asf,btohqsg
U can fragment the subject into simpler pieces,btohqsg
Like if u were to have bio and geog lessons on the same day,btohqsg
That's also cuz all schs for geog teach irrelevant stuff that u can remove,btohqsg
Issue with geog is that the syllabus is so vague,btohqsg
Teachers also dont know what is in syllabus and what is not in syllabus,btohqsg
For me I just abandoned two subjects (H2 Chem and H2 Physics),btohqsg
Isn't it choatic when they teach,btohqsg
The only thing camvridge has ever said abt the syllabus is thatThe content from the papers would use the phrasing of the syllabus doc,btohqsg
But literally u can go so deep into any of the chapters that not many schs know whe to stop,btohqsg
That's why different schs learn completely different things as well,btohqsg
EtcMI Deforestation teaches weird ass shitEvery other sch teaches the same thing,btohqsg
Maladaptive Behavior: No point studying because not enough deforestationCognitive Restructuring: Cut down more trees to rejustify teaching about deforestatiob,btohqsg
