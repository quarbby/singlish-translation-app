TEACH ME YO WAYS MASTER SHIFU,btohqsg
GP is actually really not hard tho  there's a very structured way to go about it,btohqsg
This is so much nicer to look at,btohqsg
Don't know what MI was cooking with their new naming methology,btohqsg
Eh I hard a lot people retain j1 in MJC?,btohqsg
You ask me retake GP now,btohqsg
I heard was bad enough that,btohqsg
I got a cca mate who retained,btohqsg
No you can't even combine certs unless h1,btohqsg
The principal just let people promote to j2,btohqsg
A lvl is the main game here,btohqsg
I low-key considered that during ns,btohqsg
But I was dead sure my GP ain't getting A again,btohqsg
Eh is there still conditional now,btohqsg
Tan wan yu removed it during my yesr,btohqsg
My friend got pass 1h2 and his other h2 was 44,btohqsg
She emphasized on it last yr before she retired basically yapped ABT it,btohqsg
since alot of ppl keep finding her to be promoted to y2,btohqsg
Then she had to address at the centre stage,btohqsg
Just because of 1 mark my friend had to spend an extra year in school like bro,btohqsg
Like ok onus was on him to study but,btohqsg
She say alot of moderation alrd 38.5 -> 39 ? Then she's like we help y'all round up,btohqsg
Then what what not fair to the rest if bla bla bla,btohqsg
If not fair for the rest then do it for the rest,btohqsg
i mean i alr know like 4 ppl in my og,btohqsg
What's wrong with keeping promotional numbers up,btohqsg
At the end of the day not like MI A level grades gonna change,btohqsg
She got round up for everyone lol  she's like if everyone were to go up then what the pt of promo criteria,btohqsg
We're still gonna be just 50% >67.5,btohqsg
""" so don't go ard begging your chers for more marks""",btohqsg
I mean if people fall very short of the promo criteria then ya la,btohqsg
""" idw anyone outside my office waiting for me cause I'll be on a holiday also """,btohqsg
But like if you get 1h2 pass and 1 h2 maybe 40,btohqsg
"""just don't be the bottom 5-10% of the cohort""",btohqsg
I only hear like ppl force to retain if it's like,btohqsg
Or at least maybe an option to redo a make up exam,btohqsg
But u have a valid pt lah,btohqsg
No clue  I wasnâ€™t from there,btohqsg
It's not fair but if you offer it to everyone why not,btohqsg
She's like if y'all y1 cnnt promote means your Os content is lacking,btohqsg
Need more time to brush up,btohqsg
Tbh I barely scrapped through y1,btohqsg
So idk what point she trying to make,btohqsg
I'm so finding u if u come back for a talk,btohqsg
I don't think I'm ever coming back HAHHA,btohqsg
All my Y3 teachers left MI already,btohqsg
Back when they were still there I would come back every year,btohqsg
For cca fairs and open house,btohqsg
Yeah probably too afraid of that  that's why can't administer this,btohqsg
