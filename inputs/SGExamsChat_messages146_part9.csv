singapore just isnt that attractive for ppl to call hone,btohqsg
Our education system produce employees  not employers,btohqsg
Singapore doesnâ€™t have the culture to take these people to their limit,btohqsg
But it would certainly be interesting if we did,btohqsg
Im alr intellectually stimulated by so much stuff irl alr,btohqsg
His rank got (NS) beside it,btohqsg
and singapore market is really small too,btohqsg
unless u r working in financial sector or else most ppl choose to go overseas,btohqsg
I guess so. But why not change it? It's not like you should say  whatever  it doesn't matter if they leave,btohqsg
So many CECA with inferior qualifications competing for jobs,btohqsg
not that people dont wanna change it but our govt is unwilling to do so,btohqsg
Ironic rightLocal talents leave us  and talents from other parts of the world flock to sg,btohqsg
Even I plan to move overseas if future economic conditions are good there,btohqsg
We kind of do  through prestigious bonded scholarships like PSC that allow them to go overseas to a really good uni  but have them come back to work in SG,btohqsg
dun rly wanna stay in SG,btohqsg
But if you look at the Soviet Union  they produced so many outstanding mathematicians,btohqsg
Imo i will still prob stay in sg,btohqsg
that's cuz they had a motivation to compete,btohqsg
PSC in particular guarantees a smooth career  so u donâ€™t have them leaving,btohqsg
Sg offers some intangible benefits other countries dont,btohqsg
we just need ppl to work,btohqsg
Yeah Eastern Europe and Russia have many smart scientists,btohqsg
I came over to SG years ago and now I am questioning my own decision too,btohqsg
PSC also allows to defer NS,btohqsg
But some people don't want the bond,btohqsg
If they really donâ€™t want to stay in SG  thatâ€™s more of an overall brain drain problem than just for the geniuses,btohqsg
NS is honestly just 2 years of precious life wasted,btohqsg
U either get PSC or enter med to defer NS,btohqsg
at the most impt point of ur life,btohqsg
im not even taking medicine ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Thats why i said why not much nobel prize winners,btohqsg
But Israelis are not bad and they also have 2 years of NS  including women,btohqsg
I think scientific research wise  Singaporeans also arenâ€™t really into it,btohqsg
Oh  that means they enlist you late,btohqsg
I recently had an English comprehension practice and the passage was about how SG values are hindering us from producing such people,btohqsg
english essay is like the time to just talk shit abt singapore honestly,btohqsg
I was the earliest in my batch,btohqsg
english compre becoming more and more propaganda-ish lol,btohqsg
I still don't get why it would be 2.85 years for you,btohqsg
Is it true that Singaporeans look down at PES F (exempted) people?,btohqsg
the other day i had a compre saying how protesting is bad,btohqsg
Idk if itâ€™s true I heard companies wonâ€™t hire u,btohqsg
At least u can take the 0.85y as a legit gap year  do internship or something,btohqsg
If u get pes f for a â€œdumb â€œ reason,btohqsg
Most companies dont even ask for ur PES  unless u enlist in civil service,btohqsg
Wouldnâ€™t a company prefer F anyway,btohqsg
Well  isn't it the same as the others? They just enlist later,btohqsg
Nah I doubt it plays a factor,btohqsg
Yes but doesn't change the fact that it is 2.85 years,btohqsg
My 2 scholar teachers were corporals,btohqsg
