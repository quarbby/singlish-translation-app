Lol now I press oddle orders kena bounce out,btohqsg
Well if all they want is a photo of the bag with bike should be easy... not like car sticker. Carousell has a lot of lalamove bags on sale  some cheaper than the $19.90 official price.,btohqsg
Kena ban...same as me... cancelled their once,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  you can actually come directly at anytime to collect.,btohqsg
Hi all.. Please note if you take orders for city Square resedences... No parcels allowed after 8pm. Risk the danger of parking on the zigzag line outside.  Only food delivery allowed.,btohqsg
Im driving a lorry . But what if customer need addtional service how to we charge them? Who to inform?,btohqsg
Park at petain road and walk.,btohqsg
will probably lift the ban when not enough riders around.,btohqsg
Petain road not far. 3 mins walk,btohqsg
I'm like a week before I'm fully vaccinated,btohqsg
Thus I can't enter malls to pick up food?,btohqsg
The laws are v confusing now.,btohqsg
Please advice if you're knowledgeable. Thank you in advance,btohqsg
Unvaccinated can‚Äôt enter malls unless it is to see doctors or send kids to childcare,btohqsg
If unvax  can‚Äôt even enter malls to dapao,btohqsg
So even if for delivery  likely the guard or the saferentry ambassador won‚Äôt let you in,btohqsg
i havent stepped into a mall today. are they checking vax at entry already? gov said 1 week grace to implement.,btohqsg
Thanks brothers. Really appreciate it. Drive safe & stay safe üôè Cheers,btohqsg
if they push back enforcement by 1 week  you should be fully vax by then.,btohqsg
"""Also  unvaccinated people who work in the mall  or third-party contractors such as food delivery riders or delivery personnel  can enter the mall as they‚Äôre tested regularly due to Rostered Routine Testing.""",btohqsg
But how do they know if we do swab test or not? Cant be everyday swab test just to enter mall as swab test result only valid for 24hrs only,btohqsg
U need to show them the swab test kit result.,btohqsg
Means i must bring the ART kit?,btohqsg
Some are already checking. City Square Mall entrance today scanned my token QR code instead of the regular scanner. They will then check based on the QR code my vac status.,btohqsg
Take pic with ur name and date and time with it lo,btohqsg
Take note. DO NOT TAKE ORDER FOR THIS ADDRESS: 52 Race Course Road. Fifth Season Kolkata. They make you wait 30mins and still not there.,btohqsg
I see 5 to 6 of our LLM riders at this restaurant. One guy waited for 30mins+ fed up and left. This restaurant owner just receive order  put up delivery and make us wait. I waited 40mins and still not done.,btohqsg
Those paying for food already called us and scold us why so late. As if it's our fault.,btohqsg
Ya man. The rest please note. Sometimes they put 28 Race Course Road. Same owner. Now they got stuck with HUGE backlog.,btohqsg
This restaurant don't do orders in sequence. 2 of our riders come and take immediately. Many of us got stuck.,btohqsg
I'll avoid such restaurants next time.,btohqsg
I'm done for today. Very frustrating day. Canceled orders 3 in a row. üò°,btohqsg
I think after app update even harder for non sticker drivers to take popular multi-stop orders. Keep losing out such orders,btohqsg
I think I'm blacklisted by oodle,btohqsg
I kena block for 1 day then after that ok already,btohqsg
The merchant go and rebook another driver  cancel mine... And says I'm far away,btohqsg
When kena block  is it that u can see some orders in general page but cannot click on to see?,btohqsg
I don't see updated orders. Only those before I was blocked.. And I cannot click in to see..,btohqsg
oddle losing driver as most driver kanna ban from oddle,btohqsg
