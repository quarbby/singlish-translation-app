"According to the resolutions reported by the surveillance business supervision meeting for 11 TDRs with significantly higher premiums  the stock exchange has taken disposal measures  although the premium has declined  but still deviated from the original stock price. During the disposal period  multiple TDRs continued to be announced as valuable for paying attention to transaction information. Securities  investors are requested to be cautious about investment risks. The stock exchange reiterated that investors should learn more about TDR's operating conditions  and through the TDR area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe public information observatory  they should truly understand the TDR's financial business conditions  exchange rates  discounts and premiums  and make investments with caution. TDR is a marketable security whose original shares have been listed abroad and listed in Taiwan at the same time. The prices of the two should be linked. Investors buying TDRs with a higher premium must bear the risk of greater price fluctuations and are prone to major investment losses. There are a total of 13 TDRs listed on the securities centralized trading market. Recently  there have been cases of excessive premiums. Although they belong to different industries  they often go up and down  deviating from the normal trading market. In order to protect the rights and interests of investors  the Stock Exchange has repeatedly reminded investors to pay attention to transaction risks. Related reminders pay attention to transaction risk information. Investors can go to the company homepage (https://www.twse.com.tw/zh/) and click ""Stock Exchange News"" check",btohqsg
