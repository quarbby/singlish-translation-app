ppl say the econs dept is shit,btohqsg
n like the h2 econs notes damn long winded,btohqsg
issok iw to go uni so,btohqsg
my friend said go hg and search for ejc econs notes,btohqsg
i too stupid to do notes,btohqsg
yk i heard ej campus v pretty and modern,btohqsg
cos he wanna take music in ej,btohqsg
i have a vj friend who would kill to go ri,btohqsg
my friend went ri  APPEALED TO GO ACSI,btohqsg
but apparently he wanted to go hcicos of the chiobu,btohqsg
ib better for overseas apps yes?,btohqsg
bro prob want to study at ocbridge,btohqsg
imo you subject yourself to more pain than you need to,btohqsg
I thought rand was trashing the Econs dept not too long ago,btohqsg
because they also accept a level results,btohqsg
Said it’s the worst in sg but only good results cos the students are smart,btohqsg
the new rp system is good because the 4h2 ppl got no more advantage alr,btohqsg
The whole 2021 BOP cockup was the biggest fiasco,btohqsg
AAA/A with h3 dist can go to oxbridge,btohqsg
Yes or one H3 in place of the 4th H2,btohqsg
they only consider 3 h2 subjects and h3,btohqsg
Like my brother got B for H2 math but because of his h3 lit distinction can go,btohqsg
idk but i heard oxbridge they dont see ur h1,btohqsg
so if i take BCMh with H3 chem,btohqsg
ya esp competitive courses like chem/law,btohqsg
If 3H2 all A plus minimally a merit in h3 chem they will consider your application,btohqsg
then why jcs don't recommend us to take 4H2s (unless you're in a top tier JC),btohqsg
because most people don't want to go to a competitive course maybe,btohqsg
Almost all overseas unis don’t care about any H1 subject in fact,btohqsg
Only H2 can be seen as the equivalent of UK a levels,btohqsg
4h2 if you screw 1 h2 can dont count it in uas,btohqsg
then 3h2 ur h1 A h2 C also gg,btohqsg
h1 h2 is sg system i think,btohqsg
They have A levels and AS levels,btohqsg
I’m not exactly sure how everything works there,btohqsg
ur H1 cannot replace your worse H2 meh,btohqsg
cause uk most ppl take 3 a level mah,btohqsg
like they take 3 alvl subj,btohqsg
you go see 6th form subreddit,btohqsg
then when does the H1 count in the RP grading,btohqsg
Most ppl only take 3 subj,btohqsg
if u do well enough for your H1 to count,btohqsg
It’s a bit stupid Cambridge requires 4H2/one H3 merit if 3H2  when they expect only 3 subjects for the local version,btohqsg
but a typical offer is sth like 4A* - 3A* 1 A iirc,btohqsg
you can put it that way lor,btohqsg
I guess it’s preferential treatment for their locals,btohqsg
I mean no shit they def have to prioritise their own citizens,btohqsg
but let's say i do well for promos  can i consider taking 4h2s in j2,btohqsg
Minimally A*AA for uk a levels,btohqsg
