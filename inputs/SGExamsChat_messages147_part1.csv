Or maybe they want to build their group quickly,btohqsg
They claim to reach 3000 members now,btohqsg
They have tons of deleted accounts,btohqsg
Most of the people talking in that group are alternate accounts of the same guy,btohqsg
Apparently they pulled our member list when they started,btohqsg
Anyway they're a non-factor to us,btohqsg
I don’t know if they are trustable,btohqsg
I didn’t give Answer script lmao,btohqsg
He’s not going to sell it without answers,btohqsg
Non SG number is often a sign of alt accounts,btohqsg
Because I know how the US numbers work,btohqsg
In the US  mobile phones also have area codes. Hence even if you are in the same city but dial a mobile with a different area code  it is treated as long distance call,btohqsg
Nope  only start with 8 or 9,btohqsg
Well  for landlines there used to be   sort of,btohqsg
It's just 8 digits that's it,btohqsg
Not really area codes per se but three digit prefixes that is limited to certain areas,btohqsg
A lot of phone numbers in orchard road start with 6235 for example,btohqsg
Or 235 if you are using the old system without the 6,btohqsg
Didn't know landlines had a pattern,btohqsg
Apparently I've seen some newer numbers beginning with 3,btohqsg
That's how they know where the call is roughly coming from,btohqsg
Not just 8 and 9 anymore,btohqsg
But now it is hard to tell,btohqsg
3 is an extension of 6,btohqsg
I seen a 6 on it,btohqsg
Because they usually have a + for phone numbers that do spoofing,btohqsg
What do you mean by +65 is usually a scam,btohqsg
Because my number starts with +65,btohqsg
If you receive a call from a singapore number in singapore with +65  it is likely spoofed,btohqsg
If u call someone  ur number will not show with a +65,btohqsg
It will just start with the 8 or the 9,btohqsg
I know  but only when overseas,btohqsg
whats the tea abt that chat grp,btohqsg
the one that is stealing members from sg chat,btohqsg
Few months ago they started adding people from our groups,btohqsg
Nothing we can really do about it,btohqsg
wait usu if i get those calls from sg they wont have +65 right,btohqsg
Sometimes the information might be fake,btohqsg
One way is to not set a username. Or change your settings,btohqsg
"""We"" as in the admins  but yeah the individuals can do these",btohqsg
Well  that will be for you guys to decide,btohqsg
I don't have an @ and still got added,btohqsg
That means they added you to contacts then added you,btohqsg
A lvl anything is nowhere near deep so ....,btohqsg
H1 subjects shld be H0And H2 Subjects shld essentially be H1,btohqsg
This is a scam call I received,btohqsg
When they ask for my name,btohqsg
Which low life has such free time to do such boliao stuffs?,btohqsg
