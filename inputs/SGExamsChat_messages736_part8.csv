I can put aside how I feel,btohqsg
To pay for the fucking notes,btohqsg
I remembered the subject reps in my class keep spamming class chat w payment calls,btohqsg
U shld do the same for me,btohqsg
Play with his feelings or what not,btohqsg
Yes but some ppl dun hv,btohqsg
Idc U SC or what fucj,btohqsg
What i feel is that sometimes u can be nice but doesnt mean others will treat u the same way,btohqsg
I send the msg LAST TUESDAY,btohqsg
Just like how got this dude in my class who snatched away my notes just to get me to write teachers day card at this very instant,btohqsg
I did not even do anything,btohqsg
She was just pissed by my results and mugging,btohqsg
U should hv sought help when it happened and not let ur mental health go down the drain fr then till now,btohqsg
Coz i have experienced delaying for 3mths and it already drove me crazy,btohqsg
Coz my relative got to know about it and convinced me to go speak to someone,btohqsg
Basically i posted a sts saying i wanted to give away my items which was implying that i was s/icidal and then my friend told her ft who alerted the sch board cause i alr have a history of sh and other stuff,btohqsg
I really hope u are fine right now,btohqsg
Like i feel that u should go for counselling,btohqsg
Trying to survive and tide through ur symptoms day by day sounds scary,btohqsg
Wait musician did you see my mirror selfies,btohqsg
matcha you need a listening ear?,btohqsg
I feel@kohsyanis right that the mentally ill attract each other,btohqsg
is that a new physics thing,btohqsg
reminds me of push and pull mechanism,btohqsg
bc mentally unwell people tend to relate better and end up trauma bonding,btohqsg
which is toxic af but it happens,btohqsg
oh no ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ iÊ¼m so sorry,btohqsg
i used a pen knife to slice my palms before  as a form of self harm,btohqsg
because that was the only thing i had  and my parents kept the kitchen knives hidden soo,btohqsg
do the people around you ever question,btohqsg
but in sh classrooms got aircon so they wont comment as much,btohqsg
Do what makes U comfortable la yeah,btohqsg
all the classrooms in my school has aircons too,btohqsg
LOL one of the reasons why i wanted dhs was cause aircon classroom but jh dont have ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
oh lots of jcs have aircons for all classrooms,btohqsg
like vjc and ejc for example,btohqsg
If anyth non aircon seems almost weird,btohqsg
is the weather tryna kill us?,btohqsg
when i went upper sec i tot i'll get aircon end up MY FKING CLASS DIDN'T GET AIRCON  WHEN ALL THE OTHER SEC 3 CLASS GOT,btohqsg
bro I gonna need to manifest all my self control on fri,btohqsg
the class itself didn't have aircon,btohqsg
we got more fans BUT THAT DOESN'T REPLACE AIRCON,btohqsg
most of the classes in my secondary school had no aircon at all,btohqsg
i heard an aircon has the same coldness as 50+ fans or something,btohqsg
not sure if that still holds truth,btohqsg
i dont really recall it anymore,btohqsg
