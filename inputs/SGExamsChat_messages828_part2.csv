Some experts suggest that due to recent rapid changes in how children are raised  develop  and grow up  the time spans used to define recent generations such as Gen Alpha and later  should be shortened. They believe that  as a result of rapid technological development and its quick integration into modern society such as social media (being present for the entire lives of Gen Alpha members unlike the majority of Gen Z) as well as AI Â psychological development of these generation(s) is vastly different from any previous generation and would benefit from the definition of new generations (or re-definition of Gen Alpha) into shorter  more specific chunks.,btohqsg
