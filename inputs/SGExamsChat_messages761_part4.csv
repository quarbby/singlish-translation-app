As expected  Pahang is where the first msw tree was found I think,btohqsg
Its near the musang village so,btohqsg
"My bad  just saw this on WikipediaMusang King was originally known asRaja Kunyit  meaning ""Turmeric King""  a reference to the fruit'sturmeric-coloreddeep yellow flesh.[5] In the 1980s  a man named Tan Lai Fook fromRaub  Pahangstumbled upon a Raja Kunyit durian tree inGua Musang Kelantan Malaysia.He brought a branch of the tree back to Raub for grafting  and this new breed attracted other cultivators. The cultivar was named after Gua Musang  its place of origin.",btohqsg
So it was from Kelantan originally,btohqsg
But anyway now Pahang is where most msw are grown,btohqsg
Johor also has msw but some say itâ€™s not as nice. But I personally thought that Johor msw was nicer,btohqsg
Probably pahang more ideal growing conditions,btohqsg

"tried to help my mom transfer money to relatives overseas  cldnt because of some vague error code  went to their branches a few times  said it was cus needed physical token and when trying to login kept saying ""services are down"" on the app",btohqsg
for 16+ doesnâ€™t really matter what debit card you get tbh,btohqsg
think it turns out needed to reset the password or smth,btohqsg
every bank has their own customer service issues la,btohqsg
but that took multiple trips to diff branches to get it figured out,btohqsg
