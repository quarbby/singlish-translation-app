Need to compare between CRMc+Amaze and Choco card in terms of cost/miles for overseas spending,btohqsg
CRMC + Amaze: 4 mpd  2% markup = 0.5 cpmChoco card: 2 mpd  0.3% markup = 0.15 cpm,btohqsg
Thanks for helping to calculate. üôè,btohqsg
If you want more miles  go for CRMC. If you want cheap mile  go for HeymaxChoco.,btohqsg
Actually you can't really even consider the 0.3% to be a cost because it's impossible to get spot rate,btohqsg
Even without overseas spending  the choco card is useful for getting points for transactions that you normally won‚Äôt get rewards. I just paid donations with it and earned the max miles.,btohqsg
Choco finance + heymax:0% fee (over cc rate) for 2 max miles per dollar => 3.6% benefits (max miles are min 1.8 cpm)CRMC + Amze:2% fee (over cc rate) for 4 mpd => 4% benefits. (1.5 cpm). If you have HSBC EGA 1% cashback for CRMC then you get 5% benefits  else its a toss up between choco card and crmc + amaze,btohqsg
Amaze still has 0.5% instapt rebate ü§ê,btohqsg
I would still go with amaze + 4mpd card overseasChoc card for 2mpd with no issuer markup would be good for monkey mccs when overseas.,btohqsg
does chocolate finance earn miles when u pay for insurance? and what insurance company is covered by it?,btohqsg
Just click into eAXS and select insurance. Almost all the major providers are included.,btohqsg
Meaning all the brand that is listed in eAXS is covered by the chocolate finance + heymax debit visa card?,btohqsg
U make payment using AXS mobile or how do I pay ntuc income insurance?,btohqsg
it says AXS in the screenshot lol,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt use now  it was short lived lol,btohqsg
The card I tried using it says server error,btohqsg
And the app shows coming soon even if I have the physical card  u can‚Äôt pay with the card now  I did it for my own and wanted to use with my wife‚Äôs card but error for now,btohqsg
Hi  anyone using business account from maribank or anext? Any idea which business account is better? Or are there any pros and cons for using these digital bank?,btohqsg

Oh so it‚Äôs Axs machine? I will try tmr lo,btohqsg
Do we need to withdraw chocolate finance daily interest? If I have 50K in the account?,btohqsg
was clarifying it is not AXS machine,btohqsg
Oh I think axs machine  website or app is ok  as long as u use the choc card and link to heymax,btohqsg
Not sure tho  haven‚Äôt tried but app and web is ok and more convenient Ma,btohqsg
anyone facing problems with the choc fin app  been trying to log in to the app for 2 nights straight but shows error,btohqsg
Temporarily down  might take a while to get back up,btohqsg
1). Upgrade your Heymax n choco  apps to latest version.2). make sure you have enough balance in your choco account.3). Activate your choco card4). Link your choco card in Heymax Apps.5). Login to AXS n choose pay bill then choose insurance.,btohqsg

Income tax question: the Citi PayAll promotion is only till 28 Feb  but the income tax bill hasn‚Äôt arrived yet so I don‚Äôt know the exact amount. Is it possible to pay some amount (less than my final tax) before the tax bill arrives? I called iras and they said it‚Äôs not possible  but the lady on the phone didn‚Äôt sound very confident  so I am wondering if anyone tried. Or should I better wait for the bill and hope there will be a new promo. Thank you,btohqsg
Usually there will be another promo during the income tax season,btohqsg
Citi does not validate your actual tax amount  does it?,btohqsg
Good morning all! Anyone encountering this issue when paying income tax using Chocolate Visa card on AXS app? There's enough funds in the account,btohqsg
lol you think iras is your piggy bank ah,btohqsg
Just saw the website. Your earning varies based on citi card used. So Citi Rewards Card pays more than Premier Miles.,btohqsg
Yes but on IRAS side  if your account has no outstanding balance  they will just process a refund to you,btohqsg
Not from my experience. They will offset next tax.,btohqsg
anyone with singtel x grab savings acct? worth?,btohqsg

Hi all! I am currently selling off my BTO HDB flat and looking to downgrade from 5-room to 4-room HDB flat. Trying to get another BTO. For my next flat  is it a good move if I use my cash proceeding from current flat sales to pay off fully for my next flat so that I don‚Äôt need to HDB loan or bank loan?,btohqsg
