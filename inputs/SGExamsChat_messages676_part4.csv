Idk I read that NTU biz is the worst among the 3,btohqsg
NUS biz rejected 86 last year apparently,btohqsg
Like technically i feel NTU biz and NUS biz are lower than SMU biz,btohqsg
I think the only benefit ntu biz have is it being 3 yrs,btohqsg
Wow if only I had 90 rp wouldnâ€™t even need to be researching all this ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Howâ€™s that a benefit  I mean arenâ€™t you missing out on something at least?,btohqsg
which is honestly a big benefit,btohqsg
How can they just cut one year without compromising anything,btohqsg
I think most of their cores occur in yr 1,btohqsg
And then the rest are like specialisations or electives,btohqsg
cries in cores being needed to be taken till y3s1,btohqsg
*cries in my ml4 pulling my grade down*,btohqsg
cries in all my cores pulling my gpa down,btohqsg
Actually it was cc3 and nelly course pull me down lol,btohqsg
tbh a lot of the stuff you learn in uni biz isn't gonna be useful for work so you're taking less mods but that extra year can be useful for just starting work earlier,btohqsg
which is gonna be infinitely more useful than the degree itself,btohqsg
my y2s1 cores are just rubbish lmao im embarassed to look at my grades again,btohqsg
But i can assure you juniors spms is fun :D,btohqsg
mine is always non cores pulling me down,btohqsg

Our complex method prof keeps fatshaming himself  it is very sad,btohqsg
he deserves to be shamed in other ways,btohqsg
uhh i mean last time he taught complex,btohqsg
maybe he's nicer now but idk,btohqsg
i dont want to be repeating a mod,btohqsg
i rather take a D than repeat a mod,btohqsg
he's also in charge of a lot of acad stuff then,btohqsg
he failed one of my other junior's reflection LOL,btohqsg
how do you fail someone's reflection,btohqsg
He was in spms town hall,btohqsg
ok if you're trying to scare me into studying you're doing it the right way lmao,btohqsg
