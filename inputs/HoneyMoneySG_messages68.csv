Very scary sia. They happy happy jiu block people with no way to appeal. Like that if innocent people kena dun nid survive Liao,btohqsg
Then you got the money for the items you sold but account was frozen n closed. The buyer who xfer the money loss it. The scammer walked away with your items for free. Right?,btohqsg
Yes  I went down the police station to give statement for this case. End up the IO never update me le,btohqsg
how to appeal this case to MAS? is it considered a dispute with uob or report as regulatory breach or misconduct by a financial institution,btohqsg
When banks give a customer a facility (eg. Bank account or credit card) to perform financial transactions  they are also under a risk. If anything wrong  the bank may be fined by MAS. Hence  bank also wants to protect themselves.You can read up on recent ocbc phishing cases that bank loss 10 of millions dollars recently.Please take care bank account info and also don‚Äôt play with the bank facility that gives you convenience.,btohqsg
I have no info on this other than suggest you go to other bank.Just remember not to reveal your bank accounts info to strangers in the future.,btohqsg
yeah now dun dare to sell things online liao. cash is still king. it's a shame other bank dw interest match uob one account to compete,btohqsg
You have the initial copy of report from the police? Maybe try to send the scanned report to UOB to appeal,btohqsg
I understand that uob one exclusion list not able to earn cashback but does the mcc in the exclusion list at least count towards minimum spend of 500$?,btohqsg
I think all banks should follow DBS credit cards that follow the transaction date. This will make everyone's life easier,btohqsg
dun have wor  the IO never update at all. I will try writing in to UOB again. first time experience discrimination. not a good feeling üò®,btohqsg
Try ask him for a copy of the old report  even if there's no update.,btohqsg
It is already defined in the TnC what type of transactions are excluded from cashback but count towards the uob one account bonus interest.,btohqsg
Unless you have $100k in your saving  otherwise UOB One is not the highest at the moment.,btohqsg
Kena scam by UOB CSO. Called in to change my CC statement date. She said change will take effect on the following month and current month will still be the original statement date. Asked to reconfirm and she confirmed it. Apparently statement date was already changed  so now have spending that exceeded the cashback limit. üò°,btohqsg
Oo Which is the highest for lower right now. I like uob 1 cuz their requirements are easy to hit.The DBS and OCBC got so many box to tick,btohqsg
But maybe really no choice Liao. Need change bank if worse case üòï,btohqsg
Depends on how much saving you are looking at. If you only have $10k  choco 4.5%  moomoo 5.8% whereas uob one only give you 3.xx%,btohqsg
Maribank deposit 1k get 100 shoppee voucher,btohqsg
thanks will read up more. but all these no SDIC so dk safe to park emergency savings anot,btohqsg
The exclusion list for uob one savings account is more relax. I rmb insurance counts towards the 500$,btohqsg
yes insurance is the only thing that is relaxed,btohqsg
Is it safe to say that eligible spend for UOB One account interests also counted as eligible spend for UOB One card rebates? (Except insurance),btohqsg
Anyone facing issue making Salary payment into UOB One $1600  I can no longer find that option in OCBC or DBS?,btohqsg
It is stated in TnC. Pls read the TnC if you want to earn the rewards/cashback.,btohqsg
Strictly speaking no. Eg. You spend $100 on dining using UOB Lady card  the $100 counts towards uob one account bonus interest  but not count towards UOB One credit card cash rebate.,btohqsg
May i know which app can use the card to pay for hawkers centre?.bcz i saw a lot of shops just accept with paynow  can't use gpay to make a payment,btohqsg
I use PayLah! If they only accept paynow  no Cashback,btohqsg
Hello  if one is buying iPhone 15  and has a UOB Lady's card with Fashion category selected  I should purchase this off Shopee/Lazada instead of Apple Online store right? Thank you!,btohqsg
Bcz i am looking for using card to pay the hawkers with paynow?,btohqsg
Xnap can use the card to pay for paynow shop?,btohqsg
Bcz i can't see the logo under the qr code.,btohqsg
shopee MCC is marketplaces not fashion/clothing store specifically so you cant use that cardhttps://heymax.ai/merchant/shopeeuob lady supported mcc:https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf,btohqsg
You may want to take a photo of all the logo under the QR code n show us. Not all hawkers accept payment using credit card.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think you can do it  as far as I know ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Xnap app via gpay. Look out for the Xnap/liquid pay logo below the QR code.... ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for your reply :) guess I'll have to look for another avenue now haha,btohqsg
XNAP with Apple Pay can do it?,btohqsg
If u dun see the logo  likely it's not accepted by Xnap  though u can still try ur luck n scan the qr code with the Xnap app...üòÑ,btohqsg
Am not an AAPL user  so not familiar.... üòä,btohqsg
Nobody knows what you see. Hard to comment.Some hawkers only accept paynow from banks account.,btohqsg
Sometimes  the qr code accepts grabpay paynow,btohqsg
Then which once more familiar? Bcz i just have favepay and gpay,btohqsg
XNAP counted as online payment even when paying for Paynow QR ?,btohqsg
You cant use xnap on a paynow qr  only a SG qr (they are different),btohqsg
Hi experts  does anybody know if UOB lady solitiaire can be waived on the second year onwards?,btohqsg
That said yes  xnap counted as online payment. You can use it if the QR indicates a xnap or liquidpay logo below the QR code,btohqsg
Just see the logos below the qr code  if they are same as the app as you're using...dun waste time and confuse yourself about sg qr code  pay now qr code  etc ...,btohqsg
Sometimes grab pay can scan paynow QR code  but only 0.3% cashback with uob Amex   not worth trying‚Ä¶,btohqsg
yeah what i meant is   for payment using xnap is counted as online payment right even though you are paying to a QR code,btohqsg
Thats why I tend to boycott hawkers with only paynow QR (unless their food is unbelievably good). keep up with the times...,btohqsg
You see the logos below  must use the same app to scan. If u dunno just scan  at most say invalid qr,btohqsg
cause if its online payment   can use to clock for credit card / debit card cashback,btohqsg
We don‚Äôt familiar with what  xxxPay. Be it favepay or Gpay. We more familiar with the logo under the QR code. üòÄ,btohqsg
I think it is because some payment methods have some charge when withdrawing money‚Ä¶ but no charge for paynow,btohqsg
Mean need to prepare a lot of app,btohqsg
Since we started this topic  can I ask highest cashback for QR code like this(so many payments options)? XNAP with uob evol can earn 6.66% cashback?,btohqsg
Less effort = less rewardsMore effort = more rewardsIf you havent realised this is a recurring theme within this telegroup,btohqsg
yes  xnap for hawker is considered online transaction under mcc 5814 (fast food),btohqsg
Depends where you usually visit n spend.,btohqsg
Can I ask what happened to the interest for CPF special account if u have max out 198 000... the interest flow to OA or stack on top of SA..?,btohqsg
Stack on top of SA... But ur salary crediting will all go to OA,btohqsg
Sadly this kind of thing. Even with police report  uob cannot believe u 100% that u are innocent and u didn‚Äôt try to scam people to pay into your bank account.Fact is there were scam activities related to your bank account which was used to receive scam proceeds. That alone is enough for the bank to ban u (whether too harsh or not is another story la).,btohqsg
Correct me if i m wrong...,btohqsg
My understanding is only interest earned from MA will flow to OA when interest credited to your account in Dec/Jan if your MA n SA have hit max. The rest stay in the same acct.,btohqsg
I wonder how to avoid this if its paynow,btohqsg
U cant to be honest. I kena 3 time now still resolving,btohqsg
Did u get any bank problems? Like close your accounts?,btohqsg
What if i just make them transfer to grab instead,btohqsg
Thats how i usually receive payment when selling things,btohqsg
Frozen now  1 time each year due to carousell selling. Third party scam is very hard to spot,btohqsg
Bcs i heard enough about card scams and all but is that a good alternative though,btohqsg
Not all your buyer have grab or willing to use grab to do payment. Best is paylah as it will show sender number. After all the issue  i will call back the paylah number to cross check incoming transfer. But not all buyer have paylah as well. The problem is that paynow u cant vet check,btohqsg
I have got maybank closed for carousell selling. Not due to scam. The compliance team just ask me submit proof for the incoming fund and after i show them they say that personal account cant use for biz usage ( carousell) then they just closed it,btohqsg
Wow hope next time u do business with Maybank won‚Äôt have issue.Maybank family and friend credit card very useful.,btohqsg
I have secured cc with them  it is not cancelled  i guess coz it is collateral against. I know when bank closed account  they closed the cc relationship as well,btohqsg
I spend alot monthly on maybank cc anyway  maybe thry took that into consideration as well.,btohqsg
Hello all!I will be travelling to china and will be using alipay or wepay. I dont have the citi rewards card but have amaze. What is the best combination for miles points? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know what‚Äôs the best credit card to make purchases for say 5-6k? Used to use Standchart Manhattan. Is that still the best card to use? Am ok with both miles and cash back cards.,btohqsg
A close competitor for such large size transactions would be amaze + uob KF credit card at 3 miles per dollar with no cap. Provided your merchant code falls within the online shopping list of merchant codes.,btohqsg
Hello  understand that the best combination for miles is currently the citi rewards + amaze.However I am require to make big ticket items  is there any ways to go around the 1k capped?,btohqsg
I read somewhere on the history saying installment won't net any miles though,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask if the HSBC revolution and UOB lady's bonus points are based on transaction date or posted date?Eg. If I spend money on 30 September and the transaction is posted on 1 October  does my spending accumulate bonus points for my September bonus cap or October bonus cap?,btohqsg
posted date. if post on 1 oct then count to Oct,btohqsg
Hi all. For uob one credit card  if the spending of $500 is under the sub card.. will it be calculated under  credit card spending bonus interest?,btohqsg
sub card spend count to main card holder uob one account and card,btohqsg
I called up to ask  yes can transfer out any amount at end of 30days  will not affect the bonus interest. I already transferred out my 50k because it is mmf rate after 30days.,btohqsg
Any other that higher than MMF rate except UOB1  OCBC360 n Choco?,btohqsg

I took up Tiger brokers guaranteed 6% 30 days maximum 10k. But only the interest is guaranteed  how about the capital? it will be redeemed at fund's NAV ie Fullerton SGD cash fund. New promo currently is 8%.,btohqsg
Still can transfer asap. The Final cut off time is after 9pm. I m not sure the exact timing.,btohqsg
I m not JIT person. I always give some buffers.,btohqsg

As a general advice  it's better to wait for all the promo gifts  interests  to arrive in ur hands  a/c  before doing anything to the capital...üòä,btohqsg
why envious? Is it because can sell off at $250? Seems better value than getting the Afternoon Tea for 2 at Conrad¬†Centennial¬†Singapore?,btohqsg
Both are better than my $1.,btohqsg

Those who participated in poems 5.8% on 31 August  when is the best date to withdraw? Will it be better to wait monday before 10am to reap the best return? Or even now is ok?Because i am thinking if withdraw Saturday or Sunday will lose 2 extra days of returns.,btohqsg
For the Moomoo 5.8% promo  the eligibility criteria of ‚Äúnever deposited funds before 31/8‚Äù  will it count if I ever deposited funds 2 years ago when they first started? After that I withdrew and never touched since,btohqsg

Most people don‚Äôt use OA to invest. At most use for tbills.Most people probably use their OA to finance the purchase of the most important asset: housing.,btohqsg
For CPFIS once hit 40k in SA means can use the entire amount for investment?,btohqsg

Hi guys. If i hit 100k at my ocbc 360  which is the next best interest acc i should deposit to?,btohqsg
I would probably reconsider if I want to have so much liquid cash in the first place,btohqsg
but in this case OA must have 20k minimum right,btohqsg
UOB one is the best right now i suppose,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to have 20k min,btohqsg
ohh thanks thanks i thought needed 20k,btohqsg
Hi everyone  thinking of switching from OCBC 360 to UOB One account  to get the higher 3.85% (salary + spend). I can‚Äôt get 3.85% on OCBC (salary + save + spend) coz they rejected my CC application. Since UOB accepts spend via debit card  I‚Äôll just use the UOB One debit card. My question is  for the min spend of $500  are there any specific categories to take note of? Like for EVOL  certain categories give more cashback. Does the $500 include paynow/paylah spend too? Thanks!,btohqsg
UOB evol is a credit card though. and no paynow / paylah spending,btohqsg
Hi everyone   for the 200k earmarked for uob Oct promo . can I split 100k into uob one and another 100k for stash account to get the S$1 458Cash Credit Amount?,btohqsg

Wait for UOB to release the updated TnC if there is new promo.,btohqsg

Hi all Latest UOB national savings promotion is out.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.htmlI had emptied my balance from UOB ONE for this promo and hoping to top the account back as fresh funds for this promotion... Not sure if im reading and understanding this correctly  but in the link where it says in footnote 3...3‚Äôearmarked‚Äô means that the Incremental Fresh Funds deposited will not be reflected in the Eligible Account statements and cannot be withdrawn. ‚Äî> does this mean that if i were to top up the amount into my UOB ONE account  the amount does not show up in the account statement (and as such not allow me to get UOB ONE interest?). Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob earmark 5%‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg

So you mean  this apply to new customer don‚Äôt have UoB account and open a stash account before end of the year?,btohqsg

Hello guys  I‚Äôm not sure where or who to ask so I hope this isn‚Äôt the wrong place.Basically I have a lump sum of money  north of 150k  which I won‚Äôt be using for the next few years. I‚Äôm currently 22 and have zero idea of what can be done with it. The information online is overwhelming too and I don‚Äôt want to make a wrong choice because of my lack of expertise.Can anyone recommend high interest accounts I can consider? I‚Äôm studying in the UK at the moment so can consider UK accounts as well.,btohqsg
Happy to see that we have 10 000 members in this Community now!,btohqsg

Congratulations on your strong balance sheet at 22! You deserve a pat on your back for being prudent and hardworking to accumulate this üëçüèª my view is that you can invest in SSBs if you are risk averse and at your age  able to withdraw anytime without losses as and when you need the money for your next phases of life,btohqsg

Hi all  correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  UOB Christmas funds earmarked 4 months promo on incremental funds  at max 200k  $1 500 credit is only 2.25% per annum?,btohqsg
Same  I calculated 2.25% p.a. too. Is it because this Christmas promotion is on top of the bonus interest from UOB one account? 2.25% p.a. for 200k locked up for 4 months ü§î,btohqsg
Actually if that‚Äôs the case  CIMB SG promo of 3.5% flat with full flexibility of a normal savings account wins hands down. No upper limit some more,btohqsg
Actually it doesn't matter if personal or corporate account  changes can be made instantly. The issue with corporate account is you need maker checker approval process. In the case of SME or large companies  besides having HR to process the crediting account request  it also needs internal approval in the banking system.If your employer is a small SME and you are closed to the boss or HR  can be done very fast,btohqsg
Sorry guys  can I ask if I can use uob evol card for public transport to hit 600 min spend for Cashback and 500 for the higher interest,btohqsg

For POSB everyday card if I pay spc petrol via googlepay will I still enjoy 20.1% saving? Or must use physical card?,btohqsg

Thanks Mouse Hunter  I prefer the flexibility of CIMB sg 3.5% for the next 6 months,btohqsg
about what? All these are facts right?,btohqsg
Yeah disagreement that the specified merchants can be true 10% cashback because of the $100 additional cashback cap per month.U cannot spend $2000 at Cold Storage and get $200 cashback per month.,btohqsg

Will there be any duplicated payment as I have already set up the monthly loan repayment with my savings account already? Or do I need to terminate the arrangement first?,btohqsg
Dont need. Cardup will transfer amount to your bank account after charging your card,btohqsg
Ha  just to make sure I understand it correctly. Cardup will transfer the money to the savings account which the bank deduct from each month  and I do not need to make any bank transfer to this account to ensure that it has the funds to service the mortgage,btohqsg
So I am kind of using the credit card to transfer the money instead of transferring from another bank account,btohqsg

Some FA in the US crunched out some numbers & their guideline is that  if the amount you're planning to invest in the market exceeds a certain % of your investment portfolio  you should DCA it.Iirc if amount to be invested > 10%  you should DCA it over 5 months. Every 5% increase you should add a month.This is so that it takes away the guesswork in whether or not the market is going to go down further or is it going to go up.But if you're confident that the market now is not going to go further down  feel free to lump sum. The impt thing here is time-in-market > timing the market. Just make sure to leave a good portion of your assets in liquid cash so you can access it in case of emergencies,btohqsg
Hi experts  are there any credit cards that includes recurring payment (investment & insurance policy) as rebate/cash back?,btohqsg

Hi Rose  the main difference is the duration. T bills are 6 months or 1 year investments and SSBs are 10 year investments. The latter is very liquid and can be liquidated without losses. Do check out the MAS website to see all the details  they did a good job to explain to retail investors. Good luck on your journey  with your good start  your success probability is very high in life than many others,btohqsg

10% guideline applicable to SSB? As in spread out over a few months or lump sum?,btohqsg
Hotline person told me it's 30 calendar days.,btohqsg
For them  their guideline only applies to the market (so things like index funds which might generate negative returns short term). I am unsure how applicable it is to things like SSBs and T-bills which upon maturity would generate returns and the returns areknown. I would think they won't be very applicable ://,btohqsg
Doesn't that mean you have to pay $2+ five times?,btohqsg
For maybank F&F  the minimum spending will be reset in the Treats app on the 1st of every month? Or based on statement cycle? Cos my Treats app has reset the spending statistics today but my cycle should start on the 22nd of every month,btohqsg

"Anyone knows if there's a ""good time"" to withdraw money from moomoo money market fund? I.e.  initiate withdrawal to bank account and still be able to earn 1 more day of interest depending on the time I withdraw the money? If I'm not wrong  whatever is in the money market fund as of 8am of a trading day will be eligible to earn interest so if I make a withdrawal at 8.01am would that technically maximise my yield instead of say withdrawing at 7.59am?",btohqsg

Hi all  how to maximise the rewards of the Lady's card?,btohqsg
choose the category that you can max out?,btohqsg
yes besides that? is there any other loopholes or boosters?,btohqsg
you can do that  but noted that value date for the $100k u deposit will be tomorrow  since today is Sunday. Average daily balance ADB= $100k√ó(30/31) = $96774  if possible can top up to max out the 7.8% for $75k to $100k tier,btohqsg
But no issues in topping up today right? My concern was cause i emptied my account yesterday on 30 sep (sat) for the promo  and topped up today (sun). Which following business value date may look as if my balance was always 100k. Thoughts on this?,btohqsg
Hi any opinions on using Trust Card? Isit good?,btohqsg
no issue  it will appear as 30 Sep end balance $0 and 2 Oct deposit $100k. Saturday is business day,btohqsg
Just watched the top 6 credit cards for f&b dining. Why was citi rewards+amaze preferred over HSBC revolution? Citi rewards still have to link to amaze for 10x points but hsbc revolution can just use as per normal right? Plus hsbc revolution includes travel as mcc. Any experts can share which is the better card? Thanks!,btohqsg
I see. Thank you good sir. But just as a precaution i took it out again. Will be topping up tomorrow. Appreciate the advice. Good luck on your personal finance journey,btohqsg
Krispay layers on top of google pay or apple pay  this means u earn the miles from your credit card AND from SIA directly.,btohqsg
Normally due to prevent any funny merchant with different category MCC outside of dining,btohqsg
Both cards have same dining mcc. So which is the better one?,btohqsg
pros and cons on both cards.hsbc revolution better points roundinghsbc revolution covers hotel mcc forhotel dining  Amaze+crmc covers most mcc except travel e.g.hotelcrmc can redeem miles with more atrline partners,btohqsg

last months i buy apple gift card at jem . it rejected for me on the lease plus point due to is gifts card,btohqsg

Easy rule is supp card always pool with main card regardless of which credit card or bank,btohqsg
Sorry boss üò±But what exception wor  genuinely didn't know,btohqsg
BOC zaobao card  used to have separate cap and spending requirements for supp card  but later changed to combined,btohqsg
Is this true? Aiya  I have been keeping 1k inside to avoid fall-below fee. So I can draw everything out  leaving $0   without any repercussions?,btohqsg
Maybe collect when u closing account,btohqsg
Using amaze too  the only problematic part is if you pay by linked credit card  any refund made by merchant will not go through and you will need to manually change the amaze default to amaze wallet in order to receive any refund  then transfer the money to other wallet then to your bank account or withdraw it from ATM machine  both with some additional charges.,btohqsg
hmm. my refunds propagated to my credit card,btohqsg
Probably I am the unlucky one then üòÖ,btohqsg
i had no encounter refund before. not sure about that but it should works.or you link to debit card it will go your bank account when the tax refund is initiated? - that will avoid the charges for withdrawal issue.because i just spend the fund in the wallet anyway - this is same case when i redeem point with the SGD 20.00.instead of trying to withdraw out.,btohqsg
Is this a itune gift card? Or gift card than can be used for products?,btohqsg

Just a note to everyone who's thinking to put money into Mari Invest Apparently they don't pay out any returns for the weekends and public holidays unlike your Fullerton funds in ur Webull / Tiger etc which pays out 1 shot on MondayThis is quite dumb IMO because i'm actually losing 2 days of interest / earnings VS putting it in the Maribank Savings Account,btohqsg

Hello everyone  I signed up for uob national savings promotion on Sept 28 for the ending date January 15 via stash account as uob one maxed out at 100K.My June 30 balance was1K in Stash and 100K in One.2 questions:1. When will the earmarked funds in stash account disappear from the display2. How much balance should I maintain until the end of promo jan 15  2024 to get the cash rewardAppreciate any inputs from your experience with this pls as I can‚Äôt seem to reach the CSO,btohqsg

Hi all  I‚Äôm planning to buy Steigen mcc 5722. They have an option using shopback paylater.I am wondering if I use dbsww and make the payment via shopback pay later  will I be entitled to 4mpd?,btohqsg
question  is it better to redeem from SSB and put it into moomoo funds to earn the 1 month interest rate?,btohqsg
If I purchase it on Shopee? Would it be advisable? In terms of maximising the rewards,btohqsg
I pay for my pilates classes via punchpass.  Does that fall into the contactless or online payment for the hsbc revol card? Punchpass is a site that houses the studios (like shopee for physical goods but it is ‚Äúshopee‚Äù for fitness classes),btohqsg
if never empty uob one acct on 30 sep  does it mean that there is no point signing up for this ?,btohqsg
depends if u have another stash of fresh funds that is not earning high interest. Topup Uob Stash is an option.,btohqsg
If i pay via installment via Lazada using DBS WWMC or any other miles card  do i still earn 4mpd ?,btohqsg
no miles if installment with bank.,btohqsg
0% installment very attractive  until the bank decides not to waive your annual fee and you have to choose between early termination fee or paying the annual fee.,btohqsg
will be in the the next few working days,btohqsg
hi hi i just apply the citi reward card when will know successful or not Ôºü need to wait few dayÔºü,btohqsg
Maybe you ask yourself if this effort is worth the $2 fee + incremental 30-day interest. And after 30days  you may lose another few days of interest depending on your next step,btohqsg
new to citibank credit card or existing card owner,btohqsg
hi just a question for those using shopback and apple  I bought some stuff on apple shop during their 5% upsized cashback  but the card hasnt been charged yet as i selected delivery  now the 5% cashback is over  will i still get the 5% cashback when the card is finally charged in a few days  or back to their normal 1%?,btohqsg
Take note that the capital is non guaranteed only the bonus interest 5.8% is guaranteed. This is low risk investment  not a risk free investment like the SSB.,btohqsg
the cashback rate used for tracking should be based on time of purchase.. not time when card is charged  in my opinion.Although apple is known for funny things like the transaction becomes an offline transaction manually processed.,btohqsg
i see  thank you! will just wait with fingers crossed then,btohqsg
will take a few days. i got mine after a week or so,btohqsg
Even the MCC also can change after transaction has been made  only make things very confusing.,btohqsg
I thought it's second business day of the month,btohqsg
On a separate note Oct SSB announcement is out!https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/auctions-and-issuance-calendar/issuance-singapore-savings-bond?issue_code=GX23110V&issue_date=2023-11-01,btohqsg
may i know what is the best date to terminate the SSB for the past issue date?,btohqsg
now also can.. since the redemption date is once a month  doesn't matter when u submit,btohqsg
Anyone know if applying for SSB when overseas on Banking App will face any problems/blocking?,btohqsg
oic  so the interest don affect,btohqsg
nope everyone will get their money back all on the same day  don't care when u submitted... interest will be calculated all on the same date too.,btohqsg
i got apply for Tbill  don face any problems,btohqsg
Looks like SSB redemption is still not in,btohqsg
Wow just saw this. Wonder if will have any over subscription situation,btohqsg
unlikely because interest rates still high  don't think will be so hot.,btohqsg
Misread earlier question but I don't want to waste my comment. So just typing out again.got DP saying if you subscribe after you put in a redemption request  it is fine..Example you have $200k SSBs now. You submit a redemption for $50k on 4th October. You are able to submit a subscription for $50k on 5th October.Everything will be processed for November.,btohqsg
Yup not yet. I have been checking too,btohqsg
If it helps  I got the 1st Oct due SSB interest payment already,btohqsg
Does anyone have a DP what happens for SCB Non Priority Banking Customers who maintain a $0 balance savings account while having positive balances in other savings account?If they are unable to deduct the fall below fee from the $0 balance savings account  what will SCB do?,btohqsg

Can someone advise if its ideal to use HSBC revo (crmc + amaze maxed out) for foreign currency spending  or to use cards like trust and etc.,btohqsg
For UOB  hotline told me that account will be negative balance (-$5) i.e. overdraft with interest charged. Not sure for SCB though.,btohqsg
SCB Supersalary no minimum balance  for non priority too.,btohqsg
Nothing happens  I do that with my e$aver at $0 while having a balance in my grandfathered Dash.,btohqsg
As long as they still have the 1% they should be still useful,btohqsg
Can I just withdraw all the amt and leave it? Or do I close it,btohqsg
Why would you want to close it?,btohqsg
leave 2k inside  use it for GIRO  earn 1% cashback,btohqsg
also can earn 1% for HSBC revolution. i think the program is called Everyday+,btohqsg
Haha what can be used for giro payment?~ since I do not have any pending payment via giro At the moment,btohqsg
EGA has minimum balance requirement 2k,btohqsg
Hmm cc bills also not fixed one haha~ just curious what if withdraw till 0. Are they still able to charge me,btohqsg
Do credit cards usually charge fx spread on top of the 3.25%+ fcy transaction fee?,btohqsg

from what i read its up to FRS   to go above FRS   you would need to manually TOP up for it to become ERS,btohqsg
Thanks WZ.Is there any point in topping up beyond FRS? What if I prefer low risk and just want to put as much as I can into RA and let it compound for me.,btohqsg
Manually top up = transfer from SA to RA right?,btohqsg
FRS and ERS difference is the payout at age 65 ownwards,btohqsg

depends what u spend on and how much,btohqsg
I have 1 major upcoming item for spending. Usually I don‚Äôt spend a lot   mostly on groceries   eating out and occasionally taking grab/taxis,btohqsg
On some other site they stated thisDo note the following exclusions  in particular DFI vouchers (e.g. Cold Storage vouchers). DBS/yuu presumably has access tolevel 3 data which means they know exactly what you‚Äôre buying at yuu merchants.,btohqsg
Can DBS and citibank point converted to air asia miles?,btohqsg
Can I withdraw money from poems while waiting for the 5.8% interest to be credited in? Want to move them to moomoo. Any minimal withdraw amount?,btohqsg
If sign up crmc through singsaver still eligible for citi's welcome offer?,btohqsg
this is stated in the TnC but in practice ppl have been getting the yuu points,btohqsg
Wow buy voucher at the cold storage or via online,btohqsg
No minimum. I deposited 31 August and withdrew everything yesterday morning before 10am. Now waiting cheque to clear today 230pm to move to moomoo too.,btohqsg
So u redeem at counter when payment,btohqsg
talking about using yuu card at cold storage/giant to buy DFI vouchers,btohqsg
I use my CRMC for all online and Amaze for in person spending. Log on to citibank app frequently to check your rewards earned for the month. Only $1000 online spend will get the 10√ó points.,btohqsg
But not eligible for flights and hotel if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Hello all  can anyone confirm how UOB Lady counts $5 block?Does every transaction have to be at least $5 or it's the total of all spending in the statement then given in $5 block (eg. Statement total is $996  I will only get $995 worth of miles)Thank you,btohqsg
Yes. Correct.  Also $1000 spending is quite low,btohqsg
idk about uob. But for dbs  they said its points based on blocks for $5 spend. So if you only spend 4.99 in a transaction   no points. Correct me if I'm wrong  this is my understanding.,btohqsg
only the 1x points need $5 blocks per transaction. 9x and 5x bonus points are calculated on accumulated spending  in the month,btohqsg
So technically still need mininum $5 per transaction for points,btohqsg

Hi evrryone. This is regarding OCBC 360. Last month  on 1st  I put abt $600 in it. My pay was credited by GIRO abt 3k+ and on that day i withdraw all as i need for monthly expenses.

Ah I didn't know shopback is considered online spend. Okay got it thanks!,btohqsg
Wait I am not sure if Shopback is considered online. You will need to double check.I would think it is online since XNAP is considered Online.,btohqsg
XNAP uses Apple/ Google Pay so it will become mobile wallet and not online,btohqsg
The system will only deduct if you are successful in your bid.,btohqsg

1) Just to be sure  you know your next quarter is Oct/Nov/Dec or assuming?  And u know it is based on statement months not calendar months?2) If you met min $500 and min 5 transactions in each month of your quarter u get $50 quarterly rebate (up to 3.33%).

Hi evrryone. This is regarding OCBC 360. Last month  on 1st  I put abt $600 in it. My pay was credited by GIRO abt 3k+ and on that day i withdraw all as i need for monthly expenses. End of month the average balance is $200+. I'm puzzled why this is so. What can i do to ensure average daily balance is at least $500 to earn the 1.2% saving bonus. Thanks a lot in advance,btohqsg
Bto so small... Josephine says it's alright...oh well,btohqsg
I mean buy just to sell for profit bro. Must sinkie pwn sinkie,btohqsg
The idea is the not working yields more return than working lel,btohqsg
topup on first of month such that the balance is $600 more than the average daily balance of last month. (Not fixed $600 as your last month end balance may be higher or lower than the average daily balance),btohqsg
Ok..what abt my pay credited and withdrawn on same day.. does it affect the average balance as transaction is done same day. What alternatives i can take,btohqsg
pay credited and withdrawn on same day (before 9.30pm) will not affect average daily balance. If with later only increase in average daily balance which is good towards the $500 increment. Should learn to use the balance tracker on ocbc website and if possible the exact computation of average daily balance (e.g. transactions on Sunday/public holidays are dated next business day),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt look at dollar amount. Look at percentage.U spend small at $500 naturally the dollar gain is small.If u can hit $2k tier u get $200 cashback after 3 months. $67 per month. This is just the base cashback. If u spend on the specific merchants u can potentially get 6.7% more cashback there.,btohqsg

Can I confirm one thing though  if I buy my flight tickets using my citi rewards card  I still get 1point per $1 right? Eventhough I don't get the bonus. Because I use all my expenditures on that card. So I rather at least get the 1point per dollar rather than having to be limited by the max cap on the other cards.,btohqsg
Is there any ongoing promo to sign up hsbc ega?,btohqsg
For example I buy like 3 flight tickets at 1.2k each on my citi rewards card. At least I get 3k points. But on uob lady's card it's only capped at 1k?,btohqsg
Citirewards (no bonus for travel) 1200*0.4 = 480milesLadys = 1000 * 6 + 200 * 0.4 = 6080 miles,btohqsg

if you manage to spend 800 on SQ  3mpd on travel  dining and online shopping.Do you have a general spend card? e.g. UOB PRVI?,btohqsg
My general spend card is citi rewards. I use it for everything. Even if excluded. I'm starting to reanalyze my credit card usage strategy. Hahahha,btohqsg
Get UOB PRVI.1.2k on UOB Ladys = 6080 miles2.4k on UOB PRVI = 3360 milesIf u use UOB PRVI on expedia / agoda can get up to 8 mpd. But price might be inflatedTotal miles = 9440 miles pooled together.,btohqsg
