Oh so don't just cry abt minority issues,btohqsg
dont treat the essay as a way for you to be angsty,btohqsg
Honestly I don’t get what’s the point of removing the current system  beyond students from different streams being in the same form class,btohqsg
Also I’m guessing schs with only regular express or IP won’t see any change,btohqsg
oh but is this only for poly,btohqsg
But I don’t get why is there the one G2,btohqsg
how they convert H2 to H1,btohqsg
So JC is still L1R5 system isit,btohqsg
Idk got diff or not sia,btohqsg
so rn is either poly intake will go up or ite intake will go up. cuz of the lowering of the net points,btohqsg

fail is U what not E,btohqsg
It says A to D pass what,btohqsg

Maybe it’s different for n level,btohqsg
A level grading system no changes announced yet except for pw,btohqsg
Yeah but the grades themselves no change,btohqsg
Even w/o the stream  it is already happening in some schools lol,btohqsg
And the H1 is only counted if it improved the rp,btohqsg
I thought for sbb the form class is still grouped by students form the same stream,btohqsg
My sis sch has all 3 streams in one class,btohqsg
Oh idk then. My sch was like that  only subject class the NA ppl taking sbb come over,btohqsg
That’s weird. Maybe diff sch moe direct them to try different approaches,btohqsg
But then like if you said the students from different streams don’t talk with each other  no point,btohqsg
this batch sec 1 is the only full SBB batch rn,btohqsg
beforehand they were testing it with different schs,btohqsg

Thought I saw him before in the regular study chats,btohqsg
I only could do that from start J2 when i realised that examples is q easy to gets one,btohqsg
Is it the only poly that offers that course,btohqsg
Even for those ppl who do well for Os and want to go poly idk why they’d go to RP for science related courses,btohqsg
Maybe stuff like hospitality I think only rp offers for certain courses,btohqsg
I wonder if he still intends to come back on april fools lol,btohqsg
I assuming he said it on discord,btohqsg
Yall should start preparing to “welcome” him,btohqsg
SP diploma is the most recognised,btohqsg
Even Cambridge recognises it while they don’t accept 3H2 without H3 students,btohqsg
