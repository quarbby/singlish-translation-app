So stressful. Work fulltime not enough  must work part time. Like North Korea,btohqsg

Prices going up  even medishield life.,btohqsg
Medishield life seems can only claim after $2000 bill. Have to use medisave to pay all. For my mother case.  Really we paying for other citizens  while gov take a backseat.,btohqsg
Some more elderly pay more for medishield life like 1000.  Already handicap  and still want to squeeze money,btohqsg
Even my retarded brother also have to pay,btohqsg
While all these while  gov take the credit for a fantastic scheme but we pay to suffer.,btohqsg
