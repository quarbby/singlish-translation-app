My apologies but can I ask since I am not eligible for the cny promo  I can transfer my funds back to my uob one account today then?,btohqsg
U can transfer but the mab will fall below 100k as today all incoming is process on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Oh I am transferring from my posb back to uob one. I am not sure does uob one gives out daily interest or based on monthly average like OCBC 360 please?,btohqsg
Hi  I have a UOB one account . Can I create a stash account end of Jan and deposit say 100k to enjoy the CNY promo ?,btohqsg
I only transferred out the money yesterday which would be processed tomorrow thus my balance on 31 Dec is unaffected and I don't have extra funds to put in haha.,btohqsg
When is the earmarked bonus payout ?,btohqsg
If u have extra 100k to put  beside the 100k in uob one,btohqsg
Oh  you're right. If only have 100k then should just leave it in UOB one account  cos 5% is better than 4.7%. I opened Stash too quickly üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyone know for CRMC  if using mobile app  how to check points history to check whether transaction have 10x points or not?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I meant. But I didn‚Äôt get the answer. Can I open the account end of Jan,btohqsg
I interpret her answer as a yes,btohqsg
Yes u can open on end jan then register and transfer in 100k,btohqsg
So u mean either or account will be earmark at any point in time and sometime both account will be earmark during overlap,btohqsg
It depend on how u plan the earmark start and end. It can overlap at time  but with the rotation  one can do 4 earmark a year max. 2 on uob one  2 for stash on assumption that uob keep having such saving promo,btohqsg
Sorry Queenie  if my withdrawal from the uob one account is processed tomorrow along with the deposit (assuming I do it now)  would you think it would cancel each other off?,btohqsg
I have uob stash earmark for national day  then i withdraw my uob one on 29th Dec  so I can register for this cny right,btohqsg
U need to see the transaction record,btohqsg
Yes  actually all can join just if u have enough fresh fund for the promo compare to the end day balance stated by bank,btohqsg
Those funds which I transfer out on 29th Dec  hehe,btohqsg
As you mentioned  the withdrawal shown processed on 2nd Jan haha,btohqsg
Anyone knows when will the snack investment be invested?,btohqsg
Should required few working day  usually fund purchase not immediate,btohqsg
Mine still not invested also. Started on 28 Dec,btohqsg
Ohh lol  I see the terms they say if before 3pm will be invested on the same day,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan we withdraw the investment then put back the 4k for this month challenge for snack?,btohqsg
The CPF interests are in  but reserved amount never increased‚Ä¶ are the interests related to the reserved value  not reserved too?,btohqsg
Sorry  how u plan is for any promo  u earmark both uob stash and uob one?,btohqsg
Only one acct can be register for any one promo,btohqsg
Thanks  I reading again the tnc  thanks!,btohqsg
Did anybody notice that the interest credited to the CPF Medisave account on 31 Dec 2023 was not transferred to the Special Account?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know cpf vcma will the interest earning be different between deposit on Jan 1st vs Jan 31st?,btohqsg
Anyone realised that the new funds is measured against 30 sept 23 instead of 31 Dec 23? Is this a mistake from UOB?,btohqsg
This month $240 challenge I feel do last few days better.,btohqsg
Read theTnCof the ‚ÄúUOB Rising Dragon Saving promo‚Äù.The info on the rest of the websites just like the burger‚Äôs like of advertisement. What you see is not what you get. üçî,btohqsg
What some do (I don‚Äôt):1. Earmark uob one for Christmas promo2. Earmark stash for cny promo.So they have 2 x $100k earmark simultaneously.,btohqsg
Even tnc has typo. Page 2 illustration Is nonsense.,btohqsg
Yeapp noticed that too. I thought was suppose to go SA if FRS not reached?,btohqsg
When does 2024 MA top up 8k tax reliefs refresh cycle ? Check CPF retirement dashboard seems still not renewed for MA,btohqsg
The person needs to rush to finish the document n head to countdown at Marina .üòÇ,btohqsg
I cannot access cpf digital service nowüòÖ,btohqsg
Interest went back into Medisave account.. Now can only top up $200+ today..,btohqsg
