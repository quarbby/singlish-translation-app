$300 for a $60k car is ok leh. 0.5% only,btohqsg
Then the next car u spend $300 ppi but u don’t want to buy again ?,btohqsg
Then probably need to consider some other methods of assessing if the car cmi or not  prior to sending for ppi. Usually Test drive can detect 80% of issues. Vibration  steering  gear change etc.,btohqsg
If test drive is good then go ppi for peace of mind,btohqsg
Ppi to detect the balance 20% of unknown issue,btohqsg
I think ppi more important for COE cars (more than 10 years)  sometimes the price of the car is not that high (less than 30k). like that $300 is not cheap  especially when many of the buyers are first time buyers and those that is tight on cash.,btohqsg
True true. Coe car more likely to have various issues that cannot be easily detected.,btohqsg
I’ve been driving coe car for some time. So far all my car also have various issues after buying 🥲,btohqsg
guys  what do you think of engine flushing  like liqui moly 3 in 1 and air con additives like coolshot ultra? Thanks,btohqsg
I think you would only use this ppi just just just before signing the agreement  cos its like the last line of defence. You dun go do ppi on any car you like ma 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Good for old cars  for newish cars <50k km you're wasting money,btohqsg
What If all the car u almost want to buy u do ppi all u cannot accept,btohqsg
As long as u got the money to spend is OK. Try ppi until u get a near perfect car lah.,btohqsg
Or bite bullet and buy new car.,btohqsg
Want BUY WAIT NEXT BIDDING AFT CNY HAHA,btohqsg
Send for this PPI after get new car. Uncover all the manufacturing imperfections as baseline for immediate warranty! Woohoo!!!!,btohqsg

Haha. Of cos. Just wanna give heads up mah,btohqsg
Lol its better than to have committed to one that's gonna spend you 10 times more rite 🤣 and if you find yourself doing ppi that fails many times  you might be better off buying from carro 🤭🤭 or just buy new car,btohqsg
No i tot its Admin F,btohqsg
if Admin T make same mistake as F  means.. F NEVER TEACH HAHA,btohqsg
Carro also not confirm ok  I think they only cover engine and gearbox? What if the issue is like the suspension or Aircon overhaul? Those are expensive to do 😐,btohqsg
I don't know ppi can even check those or not,btohqsg
Normally they tend to focus more on the engine,btohqsg
Aircon coil all this is really wear n tear,btohqsg
But if can detect it dying,btohqsg
Yeah . You know me well sir :),btohqsg

For a new car  10km\L is quite terrible. The reviewer is being very PC by calling the FC 'Average Fuel Economy' 🙃,btohqsg
to be having a 1.5 litre engine for its sizze,btohqsg
Yes I agree  it is a cat B car  they could give it 2L or even bring in the hybrid variant  dunno why kah motor insist on the 1.5L ICE model,btohqsg
now all new car engine small size,btohqsg
By right should be like this  but given the size and weight of this SUV it should be like 2L or more. If not 1.8 with hybrid power train?,btohqsg
1.5L with turbo is like joke lol,btohqsg
It works on civic but not on heavier SUV like the CRV,btohqsg
Kah motor is pricing it at $267k lol. Like that Mazda or Toyota can offer better powered car,btohqsg
Can even get a entry level SUVs from the German manufacturers,btohqsg

Isn’t it too early? Shouldn’t they release more supply just before election?,btohqsg

They only release for the next quarter (3 months)  so the end of the year one still TBC,btohqsg
Ya ..my 1.8 still have 11-12 km ..I think because of turbo.. if you want car to last long don’t buy turbo ..,btohqsg
But turbo don’t rev more than 2k RPM  won’t kick in  no meh?,btohqsg
nowadays lots of turbos start lower than that. VW engines kick in at 1.5k iirc,btohqsg
I think mine kicks in at 2k only,btohqsg
If 1.5k kick in  go up slope sure kick in easily. Like that keep on engaging in that rpm not v good for engine,btohqsg

I saw a few. It’s longer than the stock rearview mirror. Anybody here uses it?,btohqsg

of course if your mirror is big type no need,btohqsg

Speaking from a software engineer's perspective:1. For Excel  it runs completely on your computer and doesn't have any network limitations. That eliminates 1 factor of network transmission time. Network is a damn fickle thing.2. I don't work for TikTok  but I'm guessing they take advantage of preloading - the videos probably start sending to your phone when the app *thinks* you'll watch it  not when u start watching it. There's also probably heavy use of caching in a local point of presence.Data of card balance can't be cached on the server side meaningfully.That said  it's not that there's no solutions but these aren't equivalent comparisons,btohqsg
1) Company used dedicated network even faster than internet leh. Existing gantry already can display fare instantly.2) can use caching also once user enter the gantry but I think is overkill Becos the data is too insignificant compared to TikTok video,btohqsg

U all remind me of a Chinese proverb the king not anxious the eunuch anxious,btohqsg
Now many also want to buy new car,btohqsg
cars will sell at the right price. there is pent up demand due to high coe prices  ppl are just waiting for prices to drop to something they can afford. if  want to move the car fast  must be willing to markdown the selling price. else be prepared to wait like other sellers.,btohqsg
i kept looking at direct seller car  each time i saw one at a good price  within 1-2 days sold. a guideline to price ur car is follow depre less 500 and above. e.g. if depre is 12k for ur car  markdown at 11.5k hopefully can sell. i think 500/year is reasonable markdown,btohqsg
overall market not sure but coe estima market not looking too good,btohqsg
Yea think the last few swings quite huge buyer don’t dare buy  sellers don’t dare adjust,btohqsg
