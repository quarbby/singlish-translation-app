anyone here knows how to cut l1r5 by maybe half in like a month... my sch’s prelim is coming in a month and honestly i barely studied-,btohqsg
i am but i feel like im not doing enough,btohqsg
how is prelims coming in a month,btohqsg
yeah but like i just use it to roughly measure my results,btohqsg
L1R5 must I include sci ?,btohqsg
if you are studying alreadynot much more you can doand also dont overwork yourselfyou sound like those ppl that post on the subreddit,btohqsg
well not for me apparently idk why but my sch has two prelims  first one is the one coming in a month,btohqsg
mid yr exam is mid yr exam,btohqsg
Wah good tho I only one leh,btohqsg
its not exactly mid yr so i dont call it that-,btohqsg
So like    my fren say sci must,btohqsg
But like I got pure humanities,btohqsg
L1R5 = English   math   pure geog   ss/lit   dNT   cl like that,btohqsg
ehh quite complicated nglsome ppl say humanities is compulsory yeai think its also based on how many subjects you take and which ones you do the best inbut honestly dont bother tooo much about the details ,btohqsg
Well  My Prelims could literally send me to nowhere (even ITE) and yet I qualified for all the options by JAE - so start planning now  work on your scheduled study/revision sessions and sacrifice everything that will not benefit you by October.,btohqsg
Hmmm  isn't that the old system?,btohqsg
Wouldn't the WA system now not allow schools to have 2 Prelims?,btohqsg
