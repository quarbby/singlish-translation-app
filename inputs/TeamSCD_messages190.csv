I follow you u no follow me back,btohqsg
Just saw. Thanks for the like spam 🤙,btohqsg
Is it like some sort of anime reference or smthg?,btohqsg
Yeah i dont watch anime 😅,btohqsg
Thats why i will send them for pre purchase evaluation,btohqsg
But I remember sta inspectors last time take bribes.  Nowdays don't know they still ....,btohqsg
this one generally for annual inspection,btohqsg
it's quite well known that if you have illegal mods  you ask workshop bring for you  they can make it pass,btohqsg
My feeling is bribes are ongoing.  It's just they have not been caught yet,btohqsg
i still know of people that failed inspection  they bring to workshop ask them send for inspection and they pass,btohqsg
Buy from agents.  They have pre owned cars too,btohqsg
but you get a peace of mind,btohqsg
But their inventory also very limited,btohqsg
Yes. Expensive a lot but at least less worried,btohqsg
and many are brands of the agent itself,btohqsg
Fake mileage nvm  dont fake engine 🤣,btohqsg
Whole processs is so tedious  not only wasting money  but time,btohqsg
I'd love to sit in a london cab,btohqsg
U forget ah. Go car meet up bring ambulance,btohqsg
go there to make sure everyone ok,btohqsg
No more in company and not breaking any rules hahaha,btohqsg
Don't need scared. Just do your due diligence  can even bring to a workshop to inspect.,btohqsg
Bbut no matter what  2nd hand car just prepare money to do some fixes can alr,btohqsg
And ask workshop mec plug obd check also,btohqsg
If you really scared just buy new car,btohqsg
@roincecnever ask go garage r check,btohqsg
Mai la  ltr you all tiu again,btohqsg
Might as well buy from direct owner,btohqsg
Anything spoil you on your own,btohqsg
“All wear and tear done” end up u need replace the whole car,btohqsg
Used dealer got taiji you can go facebook complain this shop black shop,btohqsg
they will come entertain you (or not),btohqsg
Went to view one 1 car ytd. Old mam  careful driver. Desoetareto sell his Altis within 2 months as he don't want pay another year of road tax. Asking price is 81k  registered in May 2018,btohqsg
if price is right why not?,btohqsg
Old man not necessarily will take care of his car. Same goes for female owners.,btohqsg
Important PPI and servicing checks and etc,btohqsg
Idk why ads titi like to put female owners,btohqsg
I know of girls that thought their car 10 years dunnid to service,btohqsg
They only go workshop when break down,btohqsg
This kind of female drivers can trust ah,btohqsg
My bro bought  woman driver  30k mileage  end up nvr change EO,btohqsg
Since he desperate  I will wait until closer to May then offer him lower than 81k,btohqsg
Over 30k mileage. Flushed out EO  black like kopi O,btohqsg
sold liao no regrets ok lo hahahaha,btohqsg
And workshop PPI also not necessarily foolproof also.,btohqsg
Cos you go to them to check  likely is you go to them when things break down,btohqsg
They will tell you everything is fine  cos they know you coming back to pay them salary,btohqsg
I also not very eager to get his car but see how when it's closer to May,btohqsg
Like transformer movie said “not the driver who choose cars  is the cars choose the driver”,btohqsg
Ultimately  you buy a 2nd hand car  it's always a gamble. Just need to rmb to set aside funds to repair.,btohqsg
And i pray u gamble to lose money like me,btohqsg
end of the day  buy used car  be prepared to fix it up,btohqsg
I know now demand for 2nd hand car not high especially when many ppl hoping coe will drop next few years,btohqsg
Hahahaha i spent over 10k to fix my car alr,btohqsg
My old swift i maintained it very well. Till now the new owner nv complain got issues.,btohqsg
Old car problems  2nd hand car also problem.,btohqsg
If only ppl like u  we be living in peace,btohqsg
Oh and check rims when buying 2nd hand car,btohqsg
always just assumed it'll be fine,btohqsg
No wonder car vibrates alot even after changing,btohqsg
Used car ah. Pull the dipstick  touch the oil and rub between fingers. If its watery instead of oily. Walk away,btohqsg
This one common sense applies haha,btohqsg
If everyone have common sense  we also be living in peace,btohqsg
But watery is a sign of poor grade oil  overheating engine or the oil long time nv change,btohqsg
Got fd2r  take out dipstick   no oil,btohqsg
Car sold eventually at 15m depre,btohqsg
I wonder if there's a mechanic I can ask along to go car mart together for few hours and help buyers check on the spot if the car really got no problem especially mileage tampering and EO 🤔,btohqsg
If u close to ur mech and he is free,btohqsg
"Then the sgcm ads will say ""meticulous OCD owner. Owned by car enthusiast  serviced at 5k""",btohqsg
Of course will pay him lah for his trouble,btohqsg
He need to hoist it up,btohqsg
Unless we know him   talk to him or see his ride   maybe can say,btohqsg
if serviced at AD den can call and check,btohqsg
plug in ODB some cars can see,btohqsg
“160 point check performed by our workshop!”,btohqsg
That's why@Leslhy88buy 2nd hand car really is a gamble. You paranoid so much also no use,btohqsg
99% of the dealers wont have,btohqsg
But at least with some knowledge u can catch the obvious,btohqsg
Another way I used is to check whether this indicator got remain light up after 5 seconds. Not sure reliable or not,btohqsg
I gave my servicing records to my consign agent also. The new guy nv receive,btohqsg
have but you usually you need to know the workshop to hire out their mech,btohqsg
buy brand new for no worries..,btohqsg
Good condition  undercarriage rusted and got lobang,btohqsg
definitely. But in the end still will have things spoil one,btohqsg
My car i bring to workshop PPI,btohqsg
No oil leaks  no coolant leaks  chassis straight,btohqsg
end up also so many daiji,btohqsg
Car didnt trust u and didnt choose u,btohqsg
Now he dont have a choice,btohqsg
Car Ok  driver: “lets see about that”,btohqsg
Go track with old cars..sure come back need to spend money one leh🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
If not goes scrap yard hahaha,btohqsg
this only accelerates the issues ma,btohqsg
If i nv track maybe i can last 1 more year then everything also spoil,btohqsg
After careful consideration  we regret to inform that your argument is deemed illogical and invalid.,btohqsg
Or else why ppl always said..go track is burn money one😂😂😂,btohqsg
buy used car you drive first 1 year  warranty nv claim,btohqsg
after that everything come you also wont know,btohqsg
Claim also need fork out abit,btohqsg
Labour no need pay  parts need pay,btohqsg
Buy car next time must open drive shaft and check?,btohqsg
Driveshaft can see mah when hoist,btohqsg
Mine was at 1 point some one cross thread,btohqsg
It's the same as you buy an engine rebuilt one,btohqsg
you better hope all the bolts not over torqued,btohqsg
Mine from side can see leaking alrd,btohqsg
In the end all is a gamble,btohqsg
Wan le wan le wan le bbq lo,btohqsg
save urself the trouble.. 14k deprec renault captur. warrantyyyyyyy... servicingggggggg... all gao dim@Leslhy88,btohqsg
some agent they see your car change owner they void warranty alr,btohqsg
I agree if really want a peace of mind  buy new car,btohqsg
unless it's an alfa romeo  safely can say 2 or 3 years bbo daiji,btohqsg
can understand first time owner  worried many many,btohqsg
Japanese cars can easily 10 years bodaiji also,btohqsg
New car out of my options,btohqsg
I followed my dad buy many 2nd hand cars before  that's why when i buy 2nd hand car i not scared. hahaha,btohqsg
the scams some dealer do i also see,btohqsg
"in the end is always ""LL suck thumb ownself pay""",btohqsg
Glad one of it closed down alrd,btohqsg

This is the direct owner car I mentioned. Found in carousel. The car appearance looks solid but depre turned me off and 81k not the right price,btohqsg
Bo daiji means the 10k you save,btohqsg
Depends on car also  10k not enough hahaha,btohqsg
yeah exp. 12.5k deprec on sgcm,btohqsg
Generic japanese cars shud be ok la,btohqsg
Dont say like evo or FD2R or mx5 or what,btohqsg
parf japanese cars even more unlikely to spend over 10k,btohqsg
BMWs and Audis then probably yes la,btohqsg

“Never been tracked. All parts changed proactively with no breakdowns. Meticulous owner spared no expense“,btohqsg
got 1 guy lisr 17k depre,btohqsg
List price does not equal transacted price- Confucius,btohqsg
soft top is lighter! no need worry about motors and gears also,btohqsg
the 17k depre one also soft top but auto,btohqsg
I sold c200 at 21k depre,btohqsg
I think u forgotten that the market for auto is much larger than manual….,btohqsg
But left 1 year only. So easy sell,btohqsg
Unless manual mx5 is super rare,btohqsg
Wsit till my car left 1 year you guys help me sell,btohqsg
Ok then probs can higher. But has an auto mx5 transacted at 17k before,btohqsg
That roi has up his sleeve,btohqsg
Or is that just a bs,btohqsg
I think highest recorded is 14k,btohqsg
1 manual one in market 13.9k depre mx5,btohqsg
Then that price is about as useful as 488k for ae86,btohqsg
I think that one listed for quite awhile,btohqsg
Idk  I never check mx5 market,btohqsg
Then i think in reality u are looking at 12-13k,btohqsg
Question is Jon car sold at how much,btohqsg
12k to 13k is probably can sell,btohqsg
Unless that car a lot of problem,btohqsg
As long as got viewing  anything is salesman speech,btohqsg
The auto one i went to view was sold in a month tho. 10k depre only,btohqsg
He sold at cheapest  depre in sgcm,btohqsg
Very public here don’t talk here,btohqsg

Must do the hair swee swee,btohqsg

STA isn't the best pre purchase inspection anyway  it's just a judge of road worthiness not actual condition of the car,btohqsg
But they do have pre purchase inspection n will grade the car,btohqsg
Those looking for these stickers can look for@rocketbunnyneohere!,btohqsg
They don't have the skillset or experience to check for specific issues with specific cars that a specialist might have,btohqsg
There is literally no best one  every ws inspecting will have flaws of their own.,btohqsg
I didn't say there's no flaws with the others,btohqsg
I’m just saying in general bro,btohqsg
It’s not a AMG iirc hahahah,btohqsg
9119 change few cars already. Used to be a Gallardo  Swiss pork and E class,btohqsg

Anyone got car wanna sell 👍https://telegra.ph/Instincts-Motoring-04-02,btohqsg
Hello  thanks Im looking for pic,btohqsg
Sell to this type of people we sure get low prices,btohqsg
You have experiences with their service?,btohqsg
Then which type of people give high price?,btohqsg
I will pretty much agree if you were to sell your car directly to any dealer including us… the price will be much lower as there is risk involved if the car don’t sellWe normally will advise to consign instead and we charge a transparent fee to help facilitate the sale of your vehicle• photoshoot (will send it to you for keepsake)• Marketing your car• administrative work• handling interested buyerAlternatively you can take your time to try and sell yourself…. It will be a good and fun experience to learn.Have fun 😊,btohqsg
Still waiting to know which type of ppl give high price 😂,btohqsg
When u buy at low COE and sell at High COE that is when u get “high” priceOr your car is unique like maybe u can fetch a nice price which I do know such cases#hewhoshallnotbenamed,btohqsg
Is actually waiting for that feller to say la,btohqsg
His concern is valid… there is some methods out there that causes such concern,btohqsg
Or he could also be a dealer,btohqsg
Sell direct to dealer high chance get low price. Sometimes rental company also.,btohqsg
And then they fake the mileage n sell to others,btohqsg
U got a serious bad experience bro haha,btohqsg
So u bought a fake mileage car?,btohqsg
Maybe someone just change the speedo with a different mileage and then sell the car??,btohqsg
That's why there's this thing call PPI,btohqsg
Used 2019 Hyundai Avante 1.6A GLS for Sale | M Label Auto Pte Ltd - Sgcarmarthttps://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?DL=4215&ID=1158023,btohqsg
@rng123456I also share your concern. This car  for instance  got 2 owners but 36k mileage. Dealer will definitely say they don't drive much. We cannot always take their word for it unless we ask the owners directly,btohqsg
Bro this one anyone can do... Don't need to be dealer 😂,btohqsg
Whats the link 2 owners but 36k mileage,btohqsg
My mom's car 1st gen vezel so Abt 6 years plus less then 50k. But because the car only goes from geylang east to ubi and back,btohqsg
I see where u get ur habits,btohqsg
But my car sadly going to 300k 😂,btohqsg
All the wfh underutilized cars hahah,btohqsg
That's why i said  nobody knows unless we ask the owner directly how they use the car or send for PPI. Salesman  whether car or any products  will always paint a positive picture to customer.,btohqsg
But even with her low mileage I wouldn't buy her car,btohqsg
Because it doesn't go to workshops that change oil and stuff regularly. She goes to those that just keeps it on the road,btohqsg

The duck rice is extremely popular,btohqsg
Idk man  i just feel everything is sweet.,btohqsg
The opening hours sibei short one,btohqsg
It's not that it's bad. It's pretty nice  but it's just too sweet for my taste,btohqsg
Go to Sims vista eat Hollywood duck rice,btohqsg
I believe it will be more to your taste,btohqsg
This one is on the sweet side... First time I eat like why so sweet  but eat a few times and you start to think actually ok  especially with the chilli,btohqsg
Must go non peak...the parking there quite rabs one,btohqsg
So you agree also sweet la. Hahaha i tot is just me,btohqsg
Go a few more times..it get better n better🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg

I tot the w38 is specially formulated and blended for Asian market driving conditions?😛😛😛,btohqsg
Not no stock they ending productiom,btohqsg
5.5w38 cheaper cos it's not super oil premium,btohqsg
Idk the premium got what diff but ok,btohqsg
My servicing cost just went up to 158,btohqsg
you'll probably feel like engine is lighter,btohqsg
Also dk issit cos i using new VVT valve,btohqsg
question is  is it rated for 5w30 or 5w40,btohqsg
Ibwont be surprised if it is 0w20,btohqsg
W40 more protection but abit more sluggishW30 less protection but more better throttle response,btohqsg
