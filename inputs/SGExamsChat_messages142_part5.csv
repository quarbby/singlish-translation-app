What is considered a decent or good grade in the promos?,btohqsg
Best is if you get straight As for JC1 end of year exams. Of course that may not be realistic  so perhaps everything above a B or a C should be okay. But that also depends on your performance in your previous exams.If you want to apply for scholarships or apply to study overseas in the future  this exam may be more important,btohqsg
Err get A/B for subj u confident in,btohqsg
But some school opportunities r gated by promo grades,btohqsg
Eg H3  overseas trips (maybe not this nowadays),btohqsg
So â€˜goodâ€™ would just be being able to meet the grade requirements for whatever opportunities youâ€™re interested in,btohqsg
U putting stress on all the j1,btohqsg
100% A if you answer all of the questions perfectly lol ez,btohqsg

hi just a question: is the sleep quality the same when comparing 8 hours of sleep between 10pm to 6am for instance and 1am to 9am? yes Iâ€™m more productive at night so iâ€™m contemplating if I should stay up later to study,btohqsg
if you adjust your body to sleep between 1-9 then it'll be okay I think,btohqsg
If you are used to waking up earlier then initially you will have a shorter number of hours of sleep,btohqsg
but what if i sleep at 11 usually?,btohqsg
It's like you are working from another time zone,btohqsg
Then initially you might wake up 2 hours earlier.,btohqsg
As in if you sleep at 1am,btohqsg
oh but nope iâ€™ll wake up late,btohqsg
will the sleep quality still be affected?,btohqsg
Initially not really. Your mind is used to waking up at a set time,btohqsg
If you have the curtains drawn  nothing to disturb you then no,btohqsg
It's like you are in another country,btohqsg
I guess it works the same as jet lag,btohqsg
I often sleep at 5 or 6am hahaha.,btohqsg
Jet lag happens when you change time zones,btohqsg
Not when you are on another time zone,btohqsg
yea but it's kind of the same logic,btohqsg
