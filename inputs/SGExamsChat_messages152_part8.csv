Cuz I took like 3 Os paper while in Ns then I left my sec to go pfp(sch dw me stay in sec5)  n took the remaining* subjects (but I took extra subjects too uh) to trnfr to be in JC now.,btohqsg
If you took 3 Os I assume all will be shown,btohqsg
Cuz my cert gonna look weird w/o those sub,btohqsg
Well AFAIK only zhenghu tracks O-levels,btohqsg
Even if SME IDK how much they care about Os,btohqsg
Normal company shouldn't care about Os,btohqsg
Cuz for the company I wanna go requires Os,btohqsg
What company is that? I am curious,btohqsg
Wah  the school is so kind  allow y'all to take 3 o level subjects. :(,btohqsg
Heard my friend say his friend take a lot of O level subjects then go RV after N levels,btohqsg
I'm only offered o level emath. :(,btohqsg
Is it very difficult to do it?,btohqsg
Unless your sch Willing to help you change sub,btohqsg
the person from ctss i think,btohqsg
May be rude but what is the point of just taking 3 O level subjects?,btohqsg
so year 5 no nid take,btohqsg
But I take cuz I wanted to trnfr to take pure sciences when I go sec 5,btohqsg
I come jc the knowledge is so foreign there is no relevance,btohqsg
the atomic structure everything fake one no point in knowing it at all,btohqsg
but I'm good because I don't listen in secondary school,btohqsg
So what shd I do? No matter what I do it seems that I'm screwed,btohqsg
What do you aim to be in the future?,btohqsg
Learn the fake things first then update your machine as you go!,btohqsg
Feels like everytime you move on to the next stage of education your brain needs a reset,btohqsg
Mine wasn't running much during secondary four so no resetting needed.,btohqsg
but then in life everything keeps changing so get used to it bah,btohqsg
So shd I drop to combined?,btohqsg
I got this question that I would want to ask for people's opinion. Which is would you go to the top JC and take a subject that your weak in and not do well for As or would you rather take your best subject but in the worst JC and do well for As.,btohqsg
If you want then drop but I take pure science for points,btohqsg
but depends if you can have both to be 50% each lor,btohqsg
If not you will study like one dying human in the college,btohqsg
Pure science ah drop physics take biology biology is the best,btohqsg
Idk. I'm insecure about every subject in general,btohqsg
Like since chem is 50% and another sci is 50% and if you don't do well for one how are you going to balance well for combined?,btohqsg
Also if you want go something like engineering you have o level physics A can already,btohqsg
yes  considering how i have no physics background and learnin physics in uni now,btohqsg
They told me you cant go science stream in jc if you take combined thou,btohqsg
If not you will study like one dying human in the college,btohqsg
I'm not really sure whether its true,btohqsg
just that you need get a solid A1 for some,btohqsg
Some sch only not all school offer,btohqsg
all the ppl who got A1 for combined science in my class didnt even manage a B for H2 Chem at A lvls,btohqsg
Even pure sciences don't even get A,btohqsg
Well I guess hopefully I can improve my L1R5 lol,btohqsg
@jianjun21You know in the year before pjc merge it was the most value add college?,btohqsg
i find h2 chem easier than o lvls,btohqsg
my junior batch (last batch) did way better than my batch,btohqsg
My teacher just told me that,btohqsg
double the number of 5 distinction and above students and also double the number of perfect scorers,btohqsg
Your batch is first batch of jp?,btohqsg
