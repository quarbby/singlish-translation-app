No lah hahahapeel off the leaves and bad/wilting petals if any  trim the ends at 45 degrees and up the stem vertically  put in flower food or/and sugar  lemon juice and bleach (remove bacteria) in a vase of water and vodka.If it‚Äôs droopy  you can use a needle to poke through the stem horizontally or put copper coin in vase.,btohqsg
Trim it a lil every couple of days when you‚Äôre changing water,btohqsg
