Anyone have any news of holiday surcharge coming?,btohqsg
Why viamove orders also come into lalamove lol,btohqsg
No didntJust saw 2 that said viamove order under remarks,btohqsg
is it on purpose? by instruction? why make it so difficult for us at times when they can easily check that it is the customers who are at the wrong?,btohqsg
Customer is king what. Even if customer is at fault  the most is gentle reminder. You think they will piss off customer just for us? Later customer went to other platform  they loss money. Driver partner can easily replace as there are many willing to suck up and do like most of us.,btohqsg
Just like secured zone. Customer confirm don't want pay extra. So most of them try luck. Why can't secured zone auto add inside base on the pick up or drop off location?,btohqsg
CBD can auto add  this one cannot. lol,btohqsg
There was once  it was raining heavily and after delivering the food to the customer and back to my car. I received call frm CS  asking if food has been delivered  the tone was quite harsh and keep asking me qns bout who i pass the food to? When did u pass? I have to shout back and affirm it was delivered  then CS tone changed to friendly.Cause im sure the client called to complain why so long  and im sure was within the time frame.,btohqsg
Wow sounds like some of the CS really quite CB,btohqsg
