Iâ€™m guessing your bro is doing worse than you in sch  and it makes sense for your parents to be more fixated on his results lol  obv if your alr getting decent grades I donâ€™t think any parent would be that concerned,btohqsg
Maybe thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re celebrating his smaller achievements  relative to you,btohqsg
