Anyone know whether i can combine 2 ocbc credit card expenses to clock $500 credit card spent for ocbc360 account?,btohqsg
Hello guys  can I check if I use DBS WWMC to spend $70 online  I can earn ~700 points  then redeem for this $10 voucher  which is essentially 14.5% rebate?,btohqsg
Hi all  i have a question on the 1% cashback (hsbc EGA) —> I would like to set up GIRO for my insurance payment (singlife). Will i be eligible for the 1% cashback under EGA if i set up the eGIRO arrangement through the singlife app?,btohqsg
Wrong calculation.  Dbs wwmc  count in 5 dollar block. So u get 2 dbs point per dollar spend  to get 690 point u need 345 spend,btohqsg
Ah so it's 2x points per dollar  quite misleading ngl,btohqsg

Any gurus can help with this?,btohqsg
U can try asking hsbc cso on this as egiro is fairly new,btohqsg

Card payment for big ticket item,btohqsg

Where to check how much I invested in t bill or the maturity date inside the bank app.,btohqsg
Which bank are you using? T bills using cash or CPFIA?,btohqsg
If you are using cash  then Tbills will be shown on your CDP account.If you are using CPFIA  then you should be able to find in your bank app. I’m using POSB  not too sure on OCBC,btohqsg
Click from here and scroll to CPFIA,btohqsg
Guys I heard that ocbc apps can use for usage in China. But need to use Alipay also,btohqsg
Decided to ditch Terry also? 🤣,btohqsg
Thanks bro... can let me come back here . Without being ban from the group.We all makes mistake in life. Should forgive and forget ..if you ban the person in the group . How to expect the person to learn from mistakes...,btohqsg
Hello Shifus  does it make sense to invest in both CSPX and VWRA?,btohqsg
Guys . I have a question need advise here.Let's say in order to hit welcome bonus of amex platinum charge card  of 8000 spend for 2 months. I go buy Gold jewellery... before Sept end to meet qualifying spend . Will I able to sell back to maxi cash to get back capital of 8k,btohqsg
Thanks for replying bro... then makes it no point to go for it... I told in the other group amex . .. I not willing to spend that 8k to go for welcome bonus... they disagree. When I say that if I do it... I may end up in credit card debts unable to pay back 8k to bank...,btohqsg
When I explain my reasons . They ban me,btohqsg
If I not wrong in US. Welcome bonus can be spread out in 6 months to achieve spending. Here is really too much. Instead of 6k increase to 8k sgd.,btohqsg
And here we go again 🤦🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
Just cancel the card already. No point forcing yourself to spend,btohqsg
You mean you also have this card and you cancel it .?,btohqsg
Have you considered moving to US to get an AMEX card with welcome bonus that can be spread out to 6 months for spending?,btohqsg
Now I had follow chris cancelled uob preferred platinum visa card... as I found replacement for this card,btohqsg
Another#dp  just used it in 🇧🇴  amaze+citi rewards about 3.3% off spot for BOB.,btohqsg
Let me correct you ah  you said your purpose of getting the card is to get Marriott Gold. That’s why people said it’s not wise. 😂Mind you it’s $1744 to get Marriott gold,btohqsg
buy gold and sell back usually lose money unless gold price rocketed between the period u buy and sell  because they mark up during sales  but buy back based on the raw gold price. 2 months gold price won't rocket as much.  2 years maybe,btohqsg
Yes... that's also my reason explaining.  I want to get enrolment for marriott elite gold,btohqsg
I will pay 1744 annual fee. But not 8000 welcome bonus... I worry I end up credit card debts,btohqsg
You’re playing music for a buffalo… or come join me sitback relax grab a popcorn n’ enjoy,btohqsg
Short answer: cant hit minimum spend  dont apply  no worry.Long answer: People already advised you but if you don't listen  then prepare to face the consequences,btohqsg
Example of what can happen if you are Just In Time Master (JIT).,btohqsg

For EGA interest normally when will reflect in AC?,btohqsg
Even website is down. Wow lucky I have no bills due today.,btohqsg
Then don't compare the US's credit market to Singapore's. They work differently for a reason. Drive across the border and you'll find that their credit cards have even more inferior offers,btohqsg
Inferior . Lower in rank or status.Understand bro,btohqsg
