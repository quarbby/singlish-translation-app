Can anyone explain to me how to get the 5% cash back from Citi rewards card ? I thought it's a miles card,btohqsg
Chris value miles at 1.25cents per mile,btohqsg
I feel like that part of the video wasn't well explained. Chris values a mile at 1.25c  so getting 4mpd to him is like getting 5% cashback. You can't actually get 5% cashback with the card,btohqsg
Is there no other ways to top up Revolut/youtrip by routing thru any other platforms using UOB Absolute?,btohqsg

anyone still keeping money in singlife or already transfer out to put in higher interest accounts/fixed-d/Tbills etc?,btohqsg
I'm keeping money in my SIF GoSavers account  2.5%p.a. with no hoops,btohqsg
The value of a mile is entirely subjective. one mile = 1.25 because I say so. one mile can also be worth 0.67 cents simply because I say so.,btohqsg

Hahaha.. I see.. thanks for clearing it up for me,btohqsg
The min value of a mile is 0.95c  this is the value you can use to offset the price of an air ticket.The max value of a mile is wat a bank is willing to sell you at  currently 1.92cAnything in between is highly subjective. Anyway i will cover in a video if there is enough intwrest,btohqsg

Just realised that when I link GPMC to ShopBack and pay via ShopBack  I’ll still get 6 points for every $1 spent.,btohqsg
Not sure if you link GPMC to all those favepay  shopeepay and ShopBack and use them for payment will you get grab points reward.Need some volunteers here to test.,btohqsg
Anyone tried using ShopeePay > Top up using UOB Absolute > Transfer to bank account (eg. for rental purpose),btohqsg
Hey everyone if I’m a fresh grad and I don’t have much savings  Which savings account would be best? And what about credit card? I’m alright with cash or miles!,btohqsg
