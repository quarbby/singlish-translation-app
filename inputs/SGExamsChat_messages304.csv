I noticed the number of births remain approximately constant at around 30k a year,btohqsg
but our birth rate is decreasing even though number is about there,btohqsg
birth rate calculations doesn't take into account elderly I think,btohqsg
ur pw do on that ah LOL,btohqsg

My 2nd n third ans same as urs,btohqsg
I think cause V is north east since wind blow from west to east and boat facing north?,btohqsg
How can it be north west when it's blowing from west to north,btohqsg
I might be wrong so 😢,btohqsg
I feel like if B is the scenario,btohqsg

How high is this year's  bell curve,btohqsg
What's the highest it can go🤨,btohqsg
usually is b3-a2 affected by bell curve?,btohqsg
I anyhow whack for last year paper n got C5. Erm was last year's bell curve strict/lenient?,btohqsg
Not sure. But this is an easy paper generally.I'm quite surprised by Q36  hasn't been tested for a long time.In the past  they used to connect a resistor across PQ and ask why no current flows through. And the reason is pd is zero.They test it in a way this round where it is choosing the odd one out.,btohqsg
After B4  should be pretty lenient I guess. Have one student with some learning disability supposedly according to the mum  probably scored near 60% for MCQ. Still got a B3.,btohqsg
eh if anyone knows good and affordable hair salons preferably in the north east pls intro,btohqsg

Enjoy your day vs enjoy the next 24 hours,btohqsg
Fuck mansss theres still chem tmr 🥲🥲,btohqsg
Must be nice to end your O levels on 11 Nov 😫😫,btohqsg
that was pure science last year :),btohqsg
What are the possible reasons why I fail a subject when I studied quite hard for it,btohqsg
Ur not applying what u learnt is one of the more common reasons,btohqsg
Nasib tidak menyebelahi kamu (somebody translate this coz I don't know what it is in English hahaha),btohqsg
Not using hitting key points  in exams// insufficient points (this is for sciences ah)writing out of  point (this for Humanities),btohqsg
me tooo😭😭😭 gna hv mental brkdown now,btohqsg
1) Studying hard is subjective. How hard is hard?2) Consistency. Working hard throughout the year?3) This one hardest. Working on the correct questions? If you study hard on how to do A B C but D appeared  it's as good as not being prepared.4) Exam strategy and management. Including time management etc.Off hand this came to mind.,btohqsg
For eg  my JC time  school starts at 740am and end around 3pm. I stay in library continue to work till 6pm before it's dinner.On the 1.5h bus ride home  I continue looking at my maths questions  before continuing to do homework after that till around 1am+.Every day for whole year.,btohqsg
Those were the days...i stayed in jurong i studied in vjc,btohqsg
Bus 197 2hr ride per trip...,btohqsg
ya. 5pm is days with PE.I had time for 1 main CCA and 3 fun CCAs,btohqsg
simply studying hard isnt the one size fit all strat for everyone,btohqsg
do u write your own or consult your textbook while doing it?,btohqsg
if 2 hr trip  it's 20 hrs of travel a week. So much work can be done.,btohqsg
"because contrary to popular belief not everyone needs to ""study hard""",btohqsg
Ya eat and nap and do homework all in bus,btohqsg
everyone does however need to study smart,btohqsg
So much data can be used for students nowadays 😄,btohqsg
Sometimes my cca ends at 9 reach home 11 plus,btohqsg
Next day set off at 5,btohqsg
math is really just spam  but not only spam  corrections more important than doing so make sure you do corrections too,btohqsg
Somehow I always have this problem where the math questions appear is the kind of questions I never seen in my life before lol,btohqsg
this is what I will agree as work hard 👍,btohqsg
To master math is to master the art of crafting your own soln,btohqsg
It's like a friend ask me he eats a lot but how come he can't gain more weight.His a lot is less than my normal meal.,btohqsg
Spam and drill is like praying to see similar qn,btohqsg
I only hope I can get c6 for o lvl maths lol that's all,btohqsg
Generally don't expect Sec students to be the same as JC. Rigour is much lesser.,btohqsg
Luck is not on ur side?,btohqsg
Drilling shld be able to get u to a decent pass,btohqsg
Yep trying now still got 1 year,btohqsg
next year  do other school prelims  will help a lot for those “unexpected” ones,btohqsg
school teachers are very creative in setting questions,btohqsg
It's correct ah but like it sounds weird,btohqsg
Heard that this year P2 was a disaster,btohqsg
quite ok… just a little tricky,btohqsg
all creative or unexpected math problems rlly just require you to spot the underlying principle or theorem - once u are able to do that solving math qns become much easier,btohqsg
Idk if he in the grpchat,btohqsg
Am I the only one buying stationery supplies,btohqsg
I ordered like 20 pair last month,btohqsg

T_T 1 pair per person lah,btohqsg
But I slept 3 hours before today's paper lmao,btohqsg

Any good reco for hamster toys n cheap big cages 🥺,btohqsg

Thank you HAHA hamster the  barbie girl.,btohqsg
Good luck for O levels tmr. Last paper rite?,btohqsg
No I heard some ppl got on 15 nov,btohqsg
Pure bio ppl end on 15,btohqsg
I not sure abt combi bio,btohqsg
Miss the days of econs mcq lol,btohqsg
If only a level still has that,btohqsg
Only 4 or 5 sch have I think,btohqsg
So seab set local version of paper,btohqsg
Then the international students no offence their standard lower,btohqsg
Help lower the marks needed for each grade,btohqsg
Then the dist rate is always damn high,btohqsg
My sch last year was 83% I think but I heard another sch 100% dist rate,btohqsg
So that’s why I think o level econs is free distinction,btohqsg
how many ppl take econs in ur school,btohqsg
Forgot but for my batch I think 30+,btohqsg
I think in the whole of Singapore probably just over 100 students take,btohqsg
Why i love the UK. they helped improve my results,btohqsg
ok what even is econs abt,btohqsg
The use of capitalism to abuse human rights for profit,btohqsg
Ye lol. I feel like it’s kind of cheating because you can’t go overseas to take international o levels then use ur results to apply to Singapore jc but seab is like screw it too lazy to set o level econs paper for just 4 sch so just take international paper,btohqsg

Imo hcl bonus points and affiliation shouldn’t exist at all,btohqsg
I heard volunteering doesn't 100% guarantee u can get into the sch?,btohqsg
Or if they insist on hcl bonus points make it tiered,btohqsg
So like C6 get only one bonus point,btohqsg
I mean it heightens it. But id imagine the lower income would have prob finding the time,btohqsg
