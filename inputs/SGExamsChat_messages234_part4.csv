Hello. Can I ask if anyone have 2020 prelim papers for O levels? Meaning like those top sch exam paper softcopies,btohqsg
hi so i messed up my ntu application by forgetting to submit parts of the relevant documents. the first time was my full testimonial and the second (now) was my cca records. they previously helped me to reset the submission and now I sent them another email.may I ask if this will affect my chances of admission as they may feel that I am troubling them or careless? I wrote the email with sincerity and apologised.,btohqsg
Please help as I really would like to get into NTU business. If it matters  I have 75rp (slightly higher than last year’s IGP) and have completed ABA with fuelling passion in business degree,btohqsg
just hope for the best and don’t do it again,btohqsg
i thought can use the aces.nus to add stuff in,btohqsg
ah ok  i personally dont think it will affect  cos like the people helping u add the stuff back and doing the form shouldnt be the ones deciding whether u shld enter the course or not,btohqsg
i also left out an entire Achviement section blank with personal statement etc cos i thought can fill up later. i also email them and they say help me add in  quite friendly  idt will compromise ur chacnes in anyway,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know  for NUS  if I applied during early admission (using prelim results)  how do I add in my A Level results in the app form? Cus I can only edit my particulars & course choices.,btohqsg
iirc  they will get your A level results directly from MOE.,btohqsg
Anybody know any good sources for current affairs??,btohqsg
Wikipedia if you want something quick (but at the same time you gotta check their sources),btohqsg
