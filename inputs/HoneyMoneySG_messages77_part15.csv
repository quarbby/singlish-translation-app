"hi anyone faced the issue with ocbc-ntuc card got ""blocked"" because of their termination of partnership with ntuc but not considered as cancelled and can't qualify as new card customer? i am referring to aug 2023 promo singsaver",btohqsg
I shall clarify  1st time and 3rd time are the same account.,btohqsg
TLT ETF tracks the Barclays U.S. 20+ Year Treasury Bond Index similar to how SPY and VOO track the S&P500 index. It is not a thematic.Thematics would be something likeARKK and SKYY,btohqsg
"was reading the tncs when they ended the partnership. it was stated as ""cancelled"" but well",btohqsg

Wondering if anyone knows when is the latest you can topup your SRS this year to be counted as tax deductible for next year?,btohqsg
Hi  is Endowus Cash Smart or Stashaway better for SRS investing? Hope to gather some feedback and opinions of the savvy people here before deciding. Thanks very much for any guidance and advice. Would like to balance returns and risks with as low a management fee as possible.,btohqsg
I personally think endowus is better platform because cpf allows only endowus for CPF OA investing  which mean they have went through another scrutiny/due diligence. In terms of performance and fee  I don't think it will be very similar.,btohqsg
Please take note TLT interest is subject to 30% withholding tax for non US residents.,btohqsg
Yes I received the $500 cashback from SC yesterday.,btohqsg
I have investment portfolios in both Endowus and Stashaway.Lower management fee in general - EndowusReturn and risks - Depends on portfolio type,btohqsg
Recently i got $180 for $1k spend  on sc simply cash for existing customer promo,btohqsg

Taken from AK71 blog  I think he's sounding more and more like a zen master é«˜äºº:So  it isn't just about not eating the chicken but the eggs.It is also about having more than one chicken or having a buffer.Don't consume all the eggs so that we can sell some of the eggs to buy more chickens.Of course  there were also times when buyers offered much higher prices for my chickens.I used the proceeds to buy even more chickens.Not all chickens thrive but most of them do.,btohqsg
The app doesnâ€™t show the earmark amount. You need to login into UOB online banking using browser via the desktop. Then you be able to see the earmark fund,btohqsg
Click on details. Can see available and current balance.,btohqsg

hii i have a question  is UOB ONE cc better than citi cashback+ for cashback credit cards?,btohqsg
hope someone can provide some input,btohqsg
One of the best cashback cards out there.,btohqsg
thank you  switching to UOB ONE,btohqsg
uob one card need consistent $500/$1000/$2000 in each of all 3 months in a qualifying quarter to get $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate  one mistake and rebate for whole quarter may be gone  not a easy card to use.,btohqsg
got it  understand the structure already,btohqsg
isnt there a low cap for that,btohqsg
how much u spending a month and on what?,btohqsg
Break down your expenses. You'll know if you are more suited to taking the ONE CC or EVOL CC.,btohqsg
total 4k+ on bills transport food shopping,btohqsg
You need to break it down further. Best is to which vendor and if it's online/contactless spending. Cash/paynow spending that cannot be converted to card spending should be omitted as well. The more accurate the better.But just looking at 4k+ spending  the 2k tier for UOB ONE might appeal to you most.,btohqsg
Yup. But you'll have 2k+ more spending that you have to charge to other cards,btohqsg
ohh so UOB one is capped at 2k,btohqsg
i thought the 2k is like a â€˜bonusâ€™ outside of the classic cashback,btohqsg
