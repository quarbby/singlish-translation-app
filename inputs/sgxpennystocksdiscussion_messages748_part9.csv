Prof Paul Tambyah not in list of National Awards (COVID-19) recipients despite contributions towards fight in pandemic -https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2022/12/30/prof-paul-tambyah-not-in-list-of-national-awards-covid-19-recipients-despite-contributions-towards-fight-in-pandemic/,btohqsg

Got window all come naked no dressing,btohqsg
despite Prof Tambyah’s contribution to the fight against COVID locally and internationally  he will not be recognised as part of the community in Singapore’s fight against COVID.The same goes for the four brave doctors who penned an open letter asking for masks to be made mandatory  against the Government’s narrative of no masks if you are not sick.One has only to wonder if the giving out of the announced national state awards is nothing but a political exercise by the establishment.,btohqsg

CoalHeatwaves and droughts in some areas  particularly in Europe  have also increased electricity demand and reduced hydropower. According to the IEA's annual report  global coal consumption is expected to increase by 1.2% in 2022  exceeding 8 billion tonnes in a single year for the first time and a previous record set in 2013.With demand expected to remain at similar levels in the next few years and investors still worried about further supply disruptions  prices should remain elevated in 2023.,btohqsg
