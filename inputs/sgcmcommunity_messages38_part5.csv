Depends on what you rent also  many rentals end up being more expensive than your monthly payments on a car you buy  especially if you have them for a longer term,btohqsg
Okay rent small car only haha,btohqsg
Market now for new cars really bad  but used cars still can get by. Inflated pricing for sure  but still better off than new,btohqsg
Now I go hospital. I geng untill specialist. Do all check.😂Be safe than sorry 😂,btohqsg
Although one shouldn't be buying cars in this financial climate ideally  all the signals point to an impending crisis  best to hold and keep that money liquid,btohqsg
Aiyo Mr Aaron i hope you are feeling better,btohqsg
My mom had a car accident and broke her leg. Surgery at KTPH but took very long to heal  after went TTSH for a different follow up appointment they said got bone fragment that didn't remove during the first surgery,btohqsg
Sad to say got some hospital don't have the best rep,btohqsg
Mr Xun probably stays around Sentosa cove,btohqsg
TTSH is the best. I had my wrist surgery by a senior consultant. He did a very good job. He got 4 degrees. 2 on wrist and 1 orthopaedic. 1 MBBSHe took my case  as a case study to teach young surgeon👍My metal plate was the longest he installed in his career 😂,btohqsg
