Hello everyone  I'm looking for a drop,btohqsg
anyone buy second hand toyota from borneo before? is it more reliable than dealerships?,btohqsg
Just treat it like any other dealership.  They are still out to earn your money. 🤣,btohqsg
hahaha i looking at altis should be fine? 😅,btohqsg
Toyota car is bread n butter. Doesnt mean buy from AD means reliable. They still break down just that they have less tech n more plastic parts. Repair generally cheaper,btohqsg
Recall u been asking for very long. Have u test drove any? Why toyota for ur 1st car anyway?,btohqsg
oic! so far i only tested some 2nd hand ones like vezel  sienta  vios  mazda 3,btohqsg
