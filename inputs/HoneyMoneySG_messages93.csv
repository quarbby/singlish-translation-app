Hi  may i check which wifi broadband yall recommend for a 1 year plan? Cheap and reliable  500mbps/1gbps is fine  only for 2 ppl,btohqsg
Simba or Whizzcom. Maybe Whizzcom as it is powered by SingTel.,btohqsg
sorry   if I only have these 4 credit cards: UOB one  Citi rewards  DBS Yuu VISA  or UOB Absolute cashback card  which card is the best to book scoot flight tickets? thank you,btohqsg
Hi all any card to recommend as my 2nd credit card for purchases made physically (not online) that is 4MPD?I alr have the UOB PPV to max out $1k but for subsequent purchases after $1k  I would like another card. I will likely only spend $100-300 on this card monthly!Any card except HSBC Revolution bc I had some declined issues and have to wait 6 months  thanks!,btohqsg
I m not sure what is the difference between PPV n VS. but you can explore VS which has min $1k spend n max $2k spend to earn 4mpd. Not sure is it suit you? If can  consolidation all your spends in VS.,btohqsg
UOB VS is ideal for paywave between $1000-$2000. Main difference between PPV and VS: bonus points for PPV given per transaction  while for VS it is given per accumulated spend in that statement month.Another difference is UOB VS can tap physically too (not limited to mobile contactless).,btohqsg
Vs can be used on uob$ merchant and ppv can NOT be used on uob$ merchants  due to the difference on when the uni$ is rewarded,btohqsg
For this promo  cant earn krisflyer miles right?,btohqsg
i have an account with moo moo already   still dont know how to use   can anyone briefly mention how to avail the 6.8%,btohqsg
Not sure. Just book n enter your Krisflyer number on membership field. Use eligible miles credit card to purchase.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúOcbc salary transfer‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
has anyone not received their bonus uni$ at the start of the month?received as normal dec'23 and Jan'24 but the start of month credit was missing for Feb'24,btohqsg
I received mine on 1 Feb for VS and Lady‚Äôs no issue,btohqsg
thanks mate  let me drop them an email,btohqsg
im looking for a card that doesnt have min spend of $1k as i only plan to spend less than $1k on this second card unfortunately. let me know if theres any recco all  thank you! :),btohqsg
So people suggesting you  instead of maxing out UOB PPV and looking to spend excess on another card  spend everything on UOB VS (no need for UOB PPV).,btohqsg
but i cannot as i may not hit $1k on physical spending on some months thats why üòÖ,btohqsg
Then maybe go for Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Can also see if any of your spend can fit into UOB Lady‚Äôs categories  that one has no minimum to hit and pools the same points as PPV,btohqsg
Another option to work with a $1k minimum card is to have some frontload spending options (e.g. top up NTUC gift cards) to still be able to reach the min  if you end up falling slightly short for that month.But of course at the start of the month do your own forecast first and only start spending on the VS if you think there‚Äôs a reasonable chance of hitting the minimum that month,btohqsg
Can I know how do I earn points/miles from booking Scoot flights? Can I just go to scoot app and input kris membership No?,btohqsg
Can party A book flights for party B using uob krisflyer credit card and party A can get 3mpd? Party A wont be booking a ticket for himself,btohqsg
The card that is used for payment is the card that will get points or miles,btohqsg

If i want to achieve uob one and ocbc 350 card spend of 500 person then but my spending is sometimes 500-2000  is there a way I can able to even out and still eligible to the card spend evenly 1k per month for both saving account üôè please,btohqsg
Today I saw a tips people use dbs bank cc can pay their other credit card bills  although doesn't qualify for point but can pay 1 month later then you can keep the fund longer in high interest account.,btohqsg
but no accumulation of miles   not worth it after all,btohqsg
I'm sure it affects your credit score one way or another lol,btohqsg
But applying lots of card and not every card u really use  and not able spend that much  end up changing your behaviour to contact less spend   check mcc.... once u just use this card on card u put ur money another month 4% in ocbc 360 for example. Of course in extreme you can even do ocbc NXT card and extend everything into installment but that maybe have make the accounting more difficult,btohqsg
Any recommended expense tracking app that can sync to multiple banks (UOB and DBS)?Considering subscribing to spendee? Anyone have experience?,btohqsg
More trust card changes... For those who actually use it,btohqsg
As with many things in life  you pay (in one way or another) for convenience,btohqsg
Now my problem is cannot do so much card spend on every high interest account!,btohqsg
Option 1: Put in the effort to earn 5-8% back (on average) per transaction in miles or cashbackOption 2: Figure out a way to delay paying the statement for a month to earn 5% p.a. = ~0.42% from the bank.Doesn‚Äôt even seem like much of a comparison worth considering,btohqsg
You have a good point here. üëâ  option one!,btohqsg
Pay off timely with GIRO on HSBC EGA for 1% cashback also.,btohqsg
April this year many changes to many cards  min spent increased rebate reduced.,btohqsg
Reading up on it. I'm assuming none of the expense tracking app can categorize spending by mcc right?,btohqsg
I am doing excel to tracking for monthly expenses. Time consuming. I am also interested for easy way.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if Amaze transactions (not top-up Amaze wallet) qualify for the $800 minimum spend for DBS/POSB $388 welcome offer for new cardholders? I understand that Amaze transactions are excluded from DBS card rewards.,btohqsg
U answer your own question liao. If it is excluded from rewards then what does it tell u?,btohqsg
My advice is: Explore around the free trials  and see on a price level which one suits u best,btohqsg
Hi all   for uob one account  must card transaction be before 3 day from the end of the month to be considered as counted into the spending of 500$?,btohqsg
It have to be posted by the last day of the month,btohqsg
Hi. Wanna check whether shopee paylater is a qualifying spend for uob one credit card cash back? The tnc didn't specify shopee paylater under excluded transaction,btohqsg
Which means last transaction date to be safe would be 3 days before last month,btohqsg
I think u need to phrase 3 working day,btohqsg
Ah okey thank u appreciate it!,btohqsg
Hi  do we have to use the EGA CC in order to earn the 1% rebate or can we use Revo card as well?,btohqsg
Hi gurus! What credit card would you recommend for online transaction like buying Universal Studios Japan pass? The purchase is in JPY,btohqsg

There‚Äôs not EGA Credit Card üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant Debit card üòÖ,btohqsg
It's not even on their trust bank website,btohqsg
Uob Evol can help online purchase,btohqsg
Used amaze > Uob lady‚Äôs card for my spending in JB on Saturday  any idea how long it takes to get posted? Dunno can clock the Uob $500 in time or not for Feb,btohqsg
Is the posting dependent on the merchants I shopped at  or depend on amaze? Or is it possible that the posting will delay further coz I used amaze as an in between?First time using amaze and Uob lady‚Äôs card.,btohqsg
Amaze actually causes the transaction to be posted more reliably.Usually will see posting reflected within 2 days of use.,btohqsg
Wondering how many people care on the calculations  I know friend keep using Trust for everything  but they don‚Äôt care the calculations,btohqsg
I guess if they come to this forum they care,btohqsg
May I ask for more ideas for contactless spending... fair price  mrt... I just online shopping too much I guess  thanks,btohqsg
Some people spend the time on something else that they think more important in their life,btohqsg
depends on amount and category? Online got CRMC as all rounder ma (except MRT la that one),btohqsg
300 per month contactless spend for evol card.,btohqsg
Dobin - is it normal that majority of my transactions are all uncategorised? üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi gurus. May I ask what is the cut off date of each month for the $500 UOB one account spending criteria? Is it go by last calender day or or is it the last day of the statement date?,btohqsg
How long do you need to keep the money in Citi gold to get the free iPhone?,btohqsg
It seems to be computed based on the total amount that merchants submit to UOB before the last calendar day of the month. Meaning if you spend 100 on the last day of the month  it may not be credited to the 500 for this month if the merchant does not bill UOB before month end.,btohqsg
just sharing   u can check if the transaction has been completed and if its pending it would not be included in the computation .,btohqsg
For those who transferred fund from one bank account to another every 2 months to earn higher interest  may I know if you do so end or beginning of the month?  Or there is no difference?  Thks,btohqsg
Some can take 4 to 7 working days. Don't bet on last minute purchase.,btohqsg
Amaze + eligible CC will be recommended to beat the FX fees with rewards. DO NOT use UOB EVOL.,btohqsg
It's based on posted transactions in calendar month.,btohqsg
Does spending $400 on evol and $400 on one card qualify?,btohqsg
Hihi anyone knows which platform supports DTC share transfer for the webull promo?Webull Singapore only supports Depository Trust and Clearing (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) share transfers.,btohqsg
But you don‚Äôt get extra bonus from evol and quarterly from one cc,btohqsg
Does 12 months interest free transaction count towards calculation of uob one $500 monthly spend?,btohqsg
What's the point if you can't qualify for bonus cashback on either cards?@Chandon99,btohqsg
Wish to check if Tiger and moomoo able to?,btohqsg
You can contact their client service to check,btohqsg
Reminder that EVOL requires min $600 spend to receive the cashback.,btohqsg
And $500 on UOB One lol,btohqsg
also UOB one cashback is every quarter  so if you miss out 1 month of 3 months  POOF goes your cashback,btohqsg
yes will qualify  but that is the worse thing to do,btohqsg

Is time deposit is also considered as part of first 100k in ocbc 360. Time deposit + saving account balance = 100k or both are separate for calulating the ocbc 360 interest earning.,btohqsg
Ok. Tks for the help. I saw there a change source option..,btohqsg
Anybody tried using SCB account to pay AMEX CC bills? I tried but showing invalid card number,btohqsg
Fixed deposits are paid out from the account,btohqsg
So is my understanding is correct.1. Eg Time deposit done 30k - earn 3% interest as per ongoing promotion.2. In saving account have 80k plus every month salary credit and increase mab by 500 will also attract bonus nterest on account balance + salary credit + mab increase .,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what is the MCC for Shell car wash? Is it under 5541 (based on heymax)?,btohqsg

Hi guys  my wife applied for a credit card promo via singsaver on 7 Nov. It stated in the application that they will email her within 90-120 days.

Hi all  may I ask what is the best miles card for Klook purchases?,btohqsg

Stay on course with your monthly DCA plan. My syfe equity100 (DCA weekly since 2021) has been positive since Nov 2023. It will be more green eventually as there are some China ETFs in the portfolio. China/Hang Seng markets are recovering well since early Feb 2024.,btohqsg
Hi  my HSBC bank has been restricted 3 times within 6 months after being reactivated without giving any valid reasons. It has been restricted by CDD team even I have updated my particulars at their branch. The recent restriction might hinder me to earn 1% cashback. Has anyone encountered this previously or lately? If yes  how did you resolve the matter to prevent the similar incident to happen again? Or should I just close the account?,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone know how to track which UOB transactions give me the qualifying UNI$ for the Lady‚Äôs solitaire credit card? Seems like I‚Äôm short of UNI$,btohqsg
Does anyone know a good application that tracks your spending monthly with the least amount of manual efforts (keying in  categorizing  etc) that can also provide simple insights of cashflow  etc?,btohqsg
You have to ask yourself if your syfe core growth portfolio is going to be for your long term goals like for retirement  housing  monetary gains etc. A long term investor should never be emotional no matter how the market behaves i.e. up or down. Staying invested in the market is the best course of action. One should stay disciplined and stick to your DCA plan whether you see red or green. But having said that  it is your money  so the choice is yours to decide.,btohqsg

Can I ask where do I find this ?,btohqsg
Wah  Didn‚Äôt know the expiry date  thanks a lot!,btohqsg
i personally use evol as i usually can control between 300$ online and 300$ contactless. If more than 600$ i am getting new CC or using CRMC because miles expiry is 5 YEARS from the starting date of card creation. then after that is another 5 years block,btohqsg
For the Citi rewards card  how to redeem for miles? I see the website say redeem points by paying with points  cash rebate or Citi thank you rewards,btohqsg

I‚Äôll happily take the restricted categories to have a higher cap. Not every card is for everyone,btohqsg
Not many cards for travel related spend anymore. Lady‚Äôs and wwmc still have their use although have to split the charges now,btohqsg
UOB Privimiles has 6mpd uncapped for certain airlines like Qatar and uncapped for hotel bookings like Agoda and Expedia so for me the Ladys card is mainly for low cost travel and activity bookings through Pelago,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôve found lady‚Äôs super useful to absorb upcoming wedding banquet payments rather than using up the cap on VS or PPV. And also a big plus point that remains is that it contributes to uob one spending requirement  unlike ppv or vs,btohqsg
how do you absorb wedding banquet payments ? the payments are usually way over 1k right?,btohqsg
But definitely with all the banks tightening restrictions we're going to have to work harder for the rewards. But nothing good ever comes easy üòâ,btohqsg
I found those bookings to be higher in prices than if we didn‚Äôt use the UOB links,btohqsg
I go to the hotel to make advance monthly payments,btohqsg
unlikely though  i have used and compared multiple hotels over multiple trips and they are cheaper or in fact same price,btohqsg
I see  so it can be done in an 'installment' way,btohqsg
did this in my trip to Dubai last year  Agoda's price was $3.7k while the links provided me with a price of $3.3k,btohqsg
Yup. But it's case by case whether the hotel supports this or not. Most of the major ones should,btohqsg

On 30Dec I hv over $100K. I emptied my account today so if I bank in the nx 2 days do I consider new?,btohqsg
Has anyone tried adding same UOB card to 2 different Grab accounts before?,btohqsg

Thought I can withdraw everything & bank in $100K again to enjoy the additional 1.5% on top of the 5% I am getting?,btohqsg
You have to follow the time period on the t&c,btohqsg
Ahh for the experienced  who have taken part in this Promo before..Usually when is the time period  is it a Quarterly thing?,btohqsg
Sorry  i missed out the Dec 30 eligibility. Can i check for this Rising Dragon.Is it:1) If there is another round aybe end March 31. Have to wipe out UOB one acc to $0 and deposit back after end March.2) Hold the money period for 4mths before eligible for yhe extra 1.5%?,btohqsg
The UOB CS person was giving confusing signalsShe said can use the 29Feb end balance to earmark for 29March and take part for Apr-Jun Rising Dragon Promo,btohqsg
Yes exactly my question. Sorry! I am really confuse.,btohqsg
This is my FA helping me to ask u guys‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
No problem. Based on past patterns  these promo are quite frequent which is good  every 3 months i guess. But you will need to read the t&c not to miss the step required.,btohqsg
If you have cannot add to second account  then likely cannot lor.. likely for security purposes. You can try use same PayPal? But likely will be the same,btohqsg
I already withdraw everything today so in order to enjoy the 1.5% when can I bank in to the same account again? Or open a new account?,btohqsg
By withdrawing I already lost out my $400 plus interest.,btohqsg
If I don‚Äôt get the 1.5% then I lost my $400 plus for nothing‚Ä¶..üò¨,btohqsg
As stated by Chris in his latest video  if there is a similar promo for next quarter  the next date to empty account is on 28 Mar.,btohqsg
How would you lose $400 interest? Just transfer back the money now will be fine.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what my FA checked with the CS for me.,btohqsg
You only lose on the days when you empty the account.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn!May I know why to empty account on specifically 28Feb?,btohqsg
Half the time the CSO is wrong tbh..,btohqsg
So if I reinstate all my money will I get back my $400 plus interest?,btohqsg

can i ask if i use dbs vantage card to pay my credit card bills will my vantage get the miles?,btohqsg
Sorry typo  it's 28 Mar. Because 29 Mar is a PH  and you don't want to bet that the transfer on Sat (30 Mar) will actually be posted,btohqsg
I believe Jeremy means to say that.. if you are having $100k in the account for 20 out of 30days  you will have interest for the 20 daysJust not on the 10daysIs that what you mean@JeremyLee?,btohqsg
If you withdrew everything today  and put back everything today  your balance today will not have any changes. Besides  the bonus interest is based on MAB. Only the base interest of 0.5% p.a. is computed daily.,btohqsg
That is correct.  If everything happen within a day  that shouldn‚Äôt be any loss. But if it is past 1 day  then the loss will be around $14.5 per day for 100k in account.,btohqsg
Ahhh.. okok so is the idea meaning to empty the account anytime before April comes?(*because April could be the next likely Promo  per quarter?)And since 28Mar gives a little leeway and don‚Äôt compromise on Day‚Äôs Interest so therefore 28th,btohqsg
Correct  if there's a promo  it'll likely be in Apr.,btohqsg
Thanks! üôè Appreciate it very much! üòä,btohqsg

17 Feb before 1030pm or after 1030pm? If after 1030pm then it's considered from 19 Feb instead..,btohqsg

I suggest to just transfer back the 100k now  at least you'll get 4% p.a. interest this month. That's about $220 instead of $397 for this month. If can transfer more also  then can close the gap a bit more.,btohqsg
How much more to bank in other to get back all my interest?,btohqsg
How much more to bank in order  to get back all my interest?,btohqsg
If you want to hit almost 5% p.a. for this month  you will need to transfer in at least 430k today and keep until 1 Mar morning (to be safe).,btohqsg

Ah you don‚Äôt mean / do you mean 5%pa on $430k?I think it‚Äôs only worth it for the $100k as anything above UOB one account $100k be earning 0.05% is that correctAlbeit the promo of $558 for $100k fresh funds,btohqsg
If you registered online and it doesn't get approved instantly  then you have answered one of the qns with an answer that is unsatisfactory to the bank.They will call you within 2 weeks and once they clarified on your answer  it will open within 1 week.That was what happened to me.,btohqsg
Do you happen to know if it's straightforward to go to the branch directly to apply? I was directed to an online form for a callback (cos the usual online form says I'm not eligible) but also haven't heard anything after filling in that callback form haha.,btohqsg
Means you already have an application. Go branch no use  I tried also. As long you have an existing application  they will see that one only. When did you apply?,btohqsg
That's the weird thing  I never applied though. Currently only have revo card with them and nothing else,btohqsg
Oh. If you have any credit cards with them then you need to apply through branch. Good thing is signature will be there already on the day off account opening  so can just send out your GIRO forms le.,btohqsg
Pardon me. Does salary credit count as new funds?,btohqsg
Yes. If your salary 20k/50k/100k can register with it alone. If not can just top-up the difference.,btohqsg
If you have revo only  cant apply online with instant. I visited branch for manual EGA account opening  and cant use immediately due to need to link in hsbc app. Was informed will be done within 2 to 3 working days. Waited more than 1 week with repeated calls  chat to hsbc to expedite,btohqsg
Having Revo =Existing customer. means u have to go down to branch physically to apply for ega.That's what I did. Need about 40min at the branch to get all the paperwork,btohqsg
Overall not pleasant experience opening EGA account at branch,btohqsg
I emailed them said forget it after waited 10 days,btohqsg
hello  i just did a FAST transfer from DBS with salary payment as the purpose to UOB one account. wondering roughly how long will it take for the account to acknowledge this 1.6k salary credit as it‚Äôs coming end of feb in a few days,btohqsg
Mine was online. Need to do call on zoom. Really strange,btohqsg
At this rate might as well just stick to a cashback only card,btohqsg
Just use both miles and cashback. Whichever better for the spend. Don‚Äôt have to only use one type.,btohqsg
Check tomorrow. As long as you follow the exact steps  you don't need to worry.,btohqsg

Yesterday transfer 30k to ccbc 360 account and within 5 minutes made the fd.Today found out average monthly balance is increased too.I thought fixed deposit made from ocbc 360 account not counted towards the MAB counting purpose.Fyi for everyone.(FD/TD is also counted towards monthly average balance counting purpose  if the fd made from same account),btohqsg
What time you did the fd?,btohqsg

Hi all  need advise.Currently would you go for ( home loan)1. 3.1% fixed for 1 year and reprice next year ( 2 yrs lock in)2. 2.9% fixed for 2 years ( 2 yrs lock in)Appreciate the advice.,btohqsg
Is this currently now? Outside of Changi Airport?,btohqsg
Yes. Now. You can check courts online. Not sure about GST.,btohqsg
I want to know too. Just ended my previous fixed rate,btohqsg
My experience told me number of years to lock in is also a key factor to consider. When you want to reprice with same bank  the bank usually will offer you loan interest rate that higher than other bank.Look for other bank that has 1 year lock in to compare.,btohqsg
Can share which bank offers you this rate? Roughly what is the loan amount?,btohqsg
Because you include the AppleCare+.If you dont want to buy AppleCare+  click the bin to remove it to save money.,btohqsg

hi which merchant deducts immediately when a credit card transaction is made,btohqsg
i meant   when the  transaction is  made  it reflects an immediate deduction on the credit card statement,btohqsg
Any recommendation on which credit card is good for standard chartered?,btohqsg
any specific use case ? or just for CC rewards ?,btohqsg
Just for cc rewards and to hit the bonus saver requirement,btohqsg
1. Insurance not excluded in card spend T&Cshttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/bonussaver-product-terms/2. Should be ok,btohqsg
both have same lock in. in order for option 1 to get average 2.9% rate  year 2 needs to be 2.7% to be averaged to 2.9%. I don't think within 12 months home loan rates will drop from 3.1 to 2.7%  esp when fed will earliest drop fed fund rate from May-24 (and home loans typically takes a while more to reflect the reduction in rate from Fed),btohqsg
Ahh? I thought ezlink reload to simplygo  then use the ezlink which registered in simplygo for transportation. I don't get cashback for ezlink reload?,btohqsg

There is no cashback for ezlink reload for most CC. What does the tnc for your cc say?,btohqsg
starhub is historically slow. mine also not posted today. probably tmr  hopefully!,btohqsg
Fd should not impact 360 account MAB  including other saving type in ocbc,btohqsg
Don't think so. You can check the t&c,btohqsg

Hi  for OCBC 360 bonus interest from salary  must the description be ‚ÄúGIRO - SALARY‚Äù specifically to count?,btohqsg
main thing is must be from corporate account with purpose as salary payment,btohqsg
So then that suffices? I can just tell my company HR to credit salary to the ocbc 360 account? Or need tell them write that description too?,btohqsg
no harm specify  if ur HR entertain such request. But likely they dun,btohqsg

Hi guys I am new to the group and please let me know if I am not supposed to ask questions like this and I will delete it immediately.Would like to seek for your advice.I have around 12.5k stuck inside the Singapore saving bond giving interest 3.21% and 3.47% respectively for 10 years. I realise I missed a lot of other benefits after watching some honey money YouTube video.Can anyone advise if I should redeem it and put it somewhere else? Or I should continue keeping it.Thanks,btohqsg
Off developer when nedd to use on back when u don't needs,btohqsg
Interest rate is trending downward so if i were u will keep the money in there,btohqsg
What benefits have u missed out that's worth more than your SSB?,btohqsg
Ya  I second this‚Ä¶ what benefits? I think not bad,btohqsg
I also resisting e temptation to redeem SSB and put in (another) high yield saving account or dividend paying investments.,btohqsg
SSB is a longer term play where you bet savings interest rates or something close to risk free  will drop below what SSB has promised you for 10 years.,btohqsg
luckily my starhub online payment from 25th is now posted  so the posting is not early of the day,btohqsg

Hi. I have deposited $2K  registered for the EGA Bonus Interest Promotion and performed 5 FAST transfers to other banks. How do I know if I'm qualified to receive the Bonus Interest ie. Will they send a SMS or something?,btohqsg
Yes they will sent a sms. But it took awhile to receive,btohqsg
I guess something like Moomoo‚Äôs cash plus  those saving account like scb uob one etc.,btohqsg
I thought it is once in a day only,btohqsg
Hi hi.Anyone know how to appeal with OCBC cc for late fee waiver? Call in and rejected.Also  they didn't send gift (applied early last year)  besides appealing with ocbc  can threaten to complain to who ya? üôà,btohqsg
it depends on the reason why you were late.if it was due to carelessness  many banks are not waiving it anymore as they see that as their rightful source of fee income.,btohqsg
Just cancel your card.  SC is also very strict on late payment  minimum $100 fee. I immediately cancelled,btohqsg
i also had same issue. die die say want to charge after seeking waiver like 3x. in the end i say ok i pay  just cancel my card. in the end after many months of no action they finally waived,btohqsg

if you have an unresolved late fee and you cancel the card  legally you are still required to pay the late fee and any associated interest charges the late fee had incurred.annual fee is the one that you are no longer obligated for if you cancel.,btohqsg
what if it's annual fee and that is late and you didn't pay that fee,btohqsg
if you had cancelled the card before Due Date  you are not legally obliged for all of it.,btohqsg
Ocbc? No action means? Haha so did you really cancel your card and pay the fees?,btohqsg
Haha cancel still need to pay right?,btohqsg

Hi. Just wanna confirm that UOB one credit card will look that the qualifying spend for quarterly cashback based on 3 statement months instead of 3 calendar months?,btohqsg
Also they will start from Jan-Mar  Apr-Jun  Jul-Aug  Sep-Dec yeah? Mean you cannot choose when you want to start like Feb-Apr  May-Jul etc?,btohqsg
mine is stanchart. i paid the fees then keep asking them to cancel but dunno why wasnt cancelled. few months later i go in app to see its already waived,btohqsg
do you still pay the late payment fee even you cancel?,btohqsg
Anything even come close to the 6mpd from the UOB Lady‚Äôs card? Sad to see the promo end on March 31,btohqsg
nope.. it is/was the best 6mpd card for Travel/Dining/Fashion spend.,btohqsg
yup that is why i didn't state groceries..because all along UOB Lady wasn't worth it to use on Groceries.,btohqsg
Cannot choose the quarter. The first quarter starts from the date of application. For mine  application was in August  so the first quarter is August to October.,btohqsg
I see. Cso told me it is always Jan-Mar as first quarter first. Mine application is on 21 Feb. Billing cycle starts on 13th of the month. Cso said my first quarter is 13 Jan - 12 Apr and so on. Cso said they will waive off the 13 Jan - 12 Feb first month cycle cos my approval date is 21 Feb. Means they count cashback 2 out of 3 months exceptionally,btohqsg
Strange. They told me it's based on application date of the card. Anyone else can chime in?,btohqsg
Yup. Makes more sense if starts on application month,btohqsg
Tnc stated first statement month is the approval month.,btohqsg
I see. I will ask them again based on tnc. First month should start from approval month,btohqsg

There are many hurdles to clear for the high interest saving account. And with 12.5k actually u don't get much per month. SSB is good for long term. And 3+% for 10 years I personally think it's a decent one for 10 years.,btohqsg
Yes  just pay and never ever deal with Standard chartered again,btohqsg

I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúCiti hospital‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
should use other cards  no more 4mpd for hospital mcc,btohqsg
You can change statement date  cannot change statement month.,btohqsg
They replied they have no control of statement date. Have to start from when the card approved.,btohqsg

Am curious. Many people here very interested in the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion. And I did a brief calculation for a placement range of 20K to 200K  the p/a interest rate is 1.3+% to 1.9+%. Can I understand briefly what the hype is about ?,btohqsg
Because you are still earning normal up to 5% p.a. on the UOB account. This promotion is on top of that,btohqsg
I see thanks. So is 5% and on top of that  there is an approx 1.3+% to 1.5+%. But that additional interest rate is due to the top up of funds right which u can‚Äôt withdraw for 4 mths. I mean can just place the additional funds in FD instead? Am thinking I might have missed out on something. Since it‚Äôs locked in for 4 mths  and is additional funds top up  it works like an FD and the interest rate is 1.3%+ to 1.9+% .. ?,btohqsg
yes you missed out on what is just being discussed above.EMPTY the account before the reference date.So when participating  your account will only have $100k which earns the full 5% p.a. + lock up promo of 1.5% p.a. = 6.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Am confused. Will try digesting abit. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Cos I think you are using 200k as your reference. The 6.5ish pa is using 100k.,btohqsg
If they are taking reference from 31st March which is a Sunday I think we should remove funds on 28th March considering 29th March is a PH and 30th and 31st March is a weekend,btohqsg

If first day of the month falls on Sunday or public holiday  $500 is not enough n you will miss the save bonus. I make it simple to remember - $600. If you know the MAB formula  you can adjust accordingly. For newbie  perhaps $600 is a safer play.,btohqsg

Hi all  I applied for ssb of around 10k on 01 Dec 2022 at an interest rate of 3.33% pa. I made an early withdrawal on 01 Feb 24 (around 427 days) .

Can anyone advise this?,btohqsg
Yup I just realised that too! At first I thought one bus trip is counted as one transaction. After that then found out they lump one day of travel into one transaction. Faints,btohqsg

Which fund and which platform exactly? It varies widely,btohqsg
Fullerton sg funds using moomoo recommend by honeymarket,btohqsg
And what if I do not have this card?,btohqsg
Then either you apply  or tell us what cards you have mah,btohqsg
Are u referring to the competitive application at cut-off?,btohqsg

I start using amaze recently and I did comparison paying oversee with amaze and also direct card.,btohqsg
Seem amaze rate is not as good as paying direct card,btohqsg
There would be additional charges isn't it?,btohqsg
In this case  why would pple want to use amaze when their rate is no better than direct card ?,btohqsg
The rate is almost similar to money market fund like Fullerton SGD Cash Fund,btohqsg
its doesn;t have additional charge. and theiir rates SHOULD be better than banks.,btohqsg
But based on what I paid yesterday with amaze  and uob card directly  uob gives better rate,btohqsg
The home amount is posted already? If not  did you add in the 3.25% charge?The posted transaction will then confirm the exchange rate and show the final amount with fees.,btohqsg
From uob app  both txn from amaze and direct uob shown as pending,btohqsg
OK  let me check again tomorrow when they get posted,btohqsg
Amaze converted to sgd amount is fixed already  whether posted or not. The one for UOB is the one you have to check again.,btohqsg

For paying directly with credit card  processing time may take up to 3 working days. High chance there is a 3%+ CC charge,btohqsg
Rate similar to Youtrip  sometimes lower than Youtrip abit but not alot unless u spending is high,btohqsg
Is there a closing date for this promotion?,btohqsg
Have you included the additional fees that bank charges?,btohqsg
Question: UOB 100K balance - should be strictly 100K to get the high interest ?,btohqsg
one account can overshot..stash account abit tricky..must calculate,btohqsg
U sure u used the final posted Uob amount?,btohqsg
He didn't use the final posted amount yethttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/177021,btohqsg

Noob question. For moo moo guaranteed 6.8%  after 20 days it would give me the coupons to top up for the differences in yield?,btohqsg
Hi. Can i check  for UOB one card quarterly spending  does it look at calendar month or statement month? (ie. if i spend today and it gets posted tomorrow  does it count for March spending or Feb?),btohqsg
Thanks! So spending today if posted tomorrow counts for spending in march right?,btohqsg
Technically yes  but many of reported that their top up isn‚Äôt 6.8%,btohqsg
Probably has to do with day count and slippage.To be fair. Sometimes even bank promo deposit rates won‚Äôt be accurate to the last cent. Maybe off by a few dollars.,btohqsg
Not really. If they are topping up the difference those shouldn‚Äôt matter. So in actual fact  they should be take the actual 6.8% profits and deduct from the earnings  and give you the coupon if they state they will make up the difference.,btohqsg
Not really. it is the person who manually calculate manually don‚Äôt know how to calculate until I told her how to calculate.The formula is simple. Total amount as advertise minus daily interest collected during the period. That shall be the cash coupon amount.,btohqsg
Hi Chris and all  I have subscribed to moo moo plus cash plus before. And they keep accumulating additional interests there today. But I have not signed up for the latest 6.8 % promo yet. Can I sign up for it (as in press start now) on 25th to say put 70K for 40 days then? Or would my 40 days have already started before I clicked on ‚Äústart now‚Äù since I already have existing cash plus?,btohqsg
Depends on your fund level before 1 Feb 2024. Once you registered  Need fresh funds on top of it to qualify.Timer starts once you qualify,btohqsg
What would you say is the best joint account / credit card for paying for household expenses with your significant other  and why?,btohqsg
I have had about 100 sgd from Jan to now and I have not registered yet. Does that mean I can register now and be able to add 70k for 40 days from today? And be qualified for tier 2 bonus,btohqsg
what is your statement date? what are your 3 months to make up the quarter?,btohqsg
Doesnt it follow the calendar quarters? The only quarter that doesnt follow will be the sign up month,btohqsg
Awesome thank you Chris. Moo moo is a bit complicated,btohqsg
Anyone bought from fairprice online with UOB cc? How quickly does it post the transaction?,btohqsg
no. it follows 3 specific statement months that make up your quarter,btohqsg

Usually 3 days if the transaction is done in the day,btohqsg
Hmm‚Ä¶ i just checked. In my March statement i received $33 cash back then in July i got $50,btohqsg

u can check your qualifying quarter on the statement,btohqsg
ü§£ Seems like many have this issue due to shorter month.,btohqsg
Means for March should deposit $114 900 from 1 March.  Then withdraw all from 28 March correct ?,btohqsg
Just checked. Mine follows calendar quarters. But how does thar affect on how my statements calendar month for my spending?,btohqsg
Am actually looking to switch to evol card. But hoping to clear my last month for this quarter to qualify for quarterly cashback before closing,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to check with you guys.,btohqsg
Just setup an interactive broker account as I wanted to trade etfBut I recieved an error when setting up the recurring investment structureIs it cos I no deposit any money in  that's why they don't allow me to do recurring investment?,btohqsg
Why would they allow u to do anything since u dont hv any money inside üòÇ,btohqsg
Haha alright got it. So I need to have money inside first.Cos the error message looks like this,btohqsg
so the best is to topup only on the last day of the period and next day can withdraw?,btohqsg
need to clock $500/$1000/$2000 posted eligible spending and min 5 transactions in each and every of the 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter to get $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
I got my citi rewards card approved and digital card activated. But digital card cannot see the cvv yet. Mentioned have to wait for physical card.I'm trying to use the card for online shopping which needs the cvv. Any ideas how?,btohqsg
Oh yea. I‚Äôve hit for my past 2 months. No issue. I was just wondering if i did some spending today and it only gets posted in march does it count for march or feb spending. So once i hit the $500  i can switch and start using evol and clock $600 this month too,btohqsg
post in Mar statement then count to Mar statement,btohqsg
Yup ok. So for avoidance of doubt‚Ä¶ & for benefit of others in future‚Ä¶ eg.  this counts as spending for Feb right?,btohqsg
i use chat assist able to change my statement month,btohqsg

i remember why i leave $10 already and not $0because UOB One has funny things like last day credit you $4 interest for the month.So if you do things like leave $0.00  thinking your day end balance is $0  when it is actually $4 for example..Then when you play the promo you go and do $100 000.00 exactly  you might fail the incremental funds $100 000 check..so i always have some buffere.g. day end balance $10  incremental funds $100 100...just to avoid unnecessary trouble and don't have to ask.. how come i didn't get earmark properly ah,btohqsg
can counter by remembering to check on last day and move out anything that comes in? still end day $0?,btohqsg

But then i previously read the chat to book directly from airline will be better.,btohqsg
U never book flight or hotel before in your life?,btohqsg
No experience in booking both together,btohqsg
U dont hv to book both together  just do whatever is the cheapest for you,btohqsg
That's the UOB krisflyer card right?,btohqsg
Yeah but i think booking through 3rd party website will be cheaper right? But then i want to find out what will the chances where there are issues with the bookings,btohqsg

Hi..I opened last month UOB one acct- is there a cut off date of monthly average balance- To be able to get the bonus interest? As I transfer my money slowly and not one time transfer,btohqsg

Hi all  this is my first time using cardup. Thinking to use the ocbc promo of 1.5% fee for a payment of 16k (buying a second hand motor). But the shop said they only accept paynow or cash.

Hi guys  i just graduated and i applied for the OCBC 360 account. I know that i have to use a OCBC credit card if i want the extra 0.6% additional interest. But which credit card should i get to maximise mile? OCBC 90N?,btohqsg
Alot people don't get this ocbc 90N cos they said the earn mile per dollar is low. I got it cos I don't want to go for citi rewards mastercard with amaze that gives 4mpd for eligible spend. I get this ocbc 90n as the backup card. What I like the miles is never expires but not sure ocbc will change the tnc in the future. Just my thoughts. What card u like depends on ur lifestyle and personal preference really,btohqsg
I see.. but would you go for the OCBC rewards over the 90N? I understand it has to be a OCBC credit card üòÇ sorry very new to this hahaha,btohqsg

Do you earn crmc 10 points by making grab paylater repayments using amaze+crmc?,btohqsg
There are some things you can look up to find out:1. Group vs Personal policies2. MINDEF/MHA Group Term vs SingLife Elite TermAn over-simplified version is this:1. Group policies do not belong to you  the method of payout upon death are different  there's policy change risk. Personal policies belong to you  usually have higher upfront premiums compared to their group policies equivalent  but you can be sure that what you buy is what it will be until it's surrendered.2. MINDEF/MHA Group Term is very cheap till 64  but becomes over 10x more from 65 onwards. Singlife Elite Term is the personal equivalent of MINDEF/MHA Group Term  you can cover as old as they allow you  the older it is the more expensive the premium  but like all personal policies  you earlier you start the cheaper it is and the amount won't change until surrender.Anything else can refer to your insurance agent if you have one  or look for a trusted one.,btohqsg
but wont personal policy also increase as you age ?,btohqsg
What you buy is what it will be until it's surrendered.,btohqsg
Group term gets reviewed every 4 years or as and when they want to. Personal term don't.,btohqsg

Hi Chris abit confused;BHS cap is supposed to be by age level?But you currently hit it at max BHS. Following by current cohort of $71 500 (age 65) for 2024?Then interest flow to SA (assuming not maxed to FRS at $205 800 (age 55)?So the Medisave will not be more than $71500 in 2024; even though you are not at age 65 yet?,btohqsg

Guys  whats the mpd bonus for uob lady's card after $1000 spending? Is it just 0.4mpd?And if I pay travel using Atome  will it be considered as online purchase?,btohqsg
Hi  I intend to buy a laptop from challenger.  Which cc is best for the installment? Uob one? Hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
BHS will increase yearly but fixed at 65 years old. Same concept as FRS will increase yearly but fixed at 55 years old.Difference is if MA hit BHS  any contributions to MA will go to SA if SA haven't hit FRS or go to OA if SA have hit FRS  while contributions to SA after SA hit FRS will continue to be in SA.,btohqsg
The latest video; he show 3 new hacks  but the first one shows that his MA transfer to OA.But currently not age 65 Why is that so ah?,btohqsg
Because MA cannot go above BHS  while SA can go above FRS,btohqsg
Atome is not under Lady travel. You will not  earn 6mpd from Lady.,btohqsg
I see. So is better to pay full  so at least got some rebate right?,btohqsg

Don't use CC  use a debit card like YouTrip or Trust debit card,btohqsg
Just don't pick the 10 year one?,btohqsg
Problem with Youtrip is local cannot withdraw. Its like the CBT ezlink card... put in cannot withdraw. Overseas can  prevailing exchange rate amidst other charges (if have).,btohqsg
i see theres options for 5 10 and yearly   but yearly is not guaranteed over age 65,btohqsg
Choose 5 or 10 years  or any yearly interval from the 11th year until you're 85 or cover to 99 years old1.,btohqsg
so if i get yearly   from 11th year onwards can be fixed premium?,btohqsg
Any idea why im not getting the full interest despite MAB>100k and unlocked both levels?,btohqsg
Don't pick 5/10/yearly..? Just pick the coverage up to x age? Max you can pick is 99..,btohqsg
Ouhh didnt think of that thanks,btohqsg
probably need to talk to adviser then   cause some stuff not depicted on the website   no product summary or anything,btohqsg
Use excel to calculate your adb. No point above $100 000 by too much. Get same bonus.,btohqsg
As mentioned on my previous message  talk to your agent or find one you can trust if you don't have one.,btohqsg
Because bonus interest is 0 after 100k haha.,btohqsg
if i was to talk to someone from AIA   they will only offer me AIA plans right ? Then if i was to talk to someone from Prudential   they will only offer me Prudential plans? so i would would presume i need to talk to quite a few agents from different companies to get something that is suitably priced ?,btohqsg
Depends on how good your agent is. If they willing to help you check from all the companies then good. If not you can speak to a few and compare it yourselfBased on when I got my term policy  Singlife was the cheapest  back when they were Aviva. They kind of is still.,btohqsg
okayy thanks for the helpful tips and insights,btohqsg
