i'd like to believe still have,btohqsg
"Got companies who want to continue supporting ""legacy"" cars while everything is electrified",btohqsg
Porsche being one of them because they want to keep their older cars on the roads as well,btohqsg
i still believe EVs will flop,btohqsg
and too fast for the road,btohqsg
We still don't have a performance EV actually,btohqsg
eventually when 1 starts bowling down other vehicles  people will start to say things,btohqsg
I'm keen to see the new 718 EV coming end of this year,btohqsg
in the long run dt evs will flop bc sustainability..,btohqsg
Battery tech needs to go a long way for it to be sustainable,btohqsg
And sources of energy for the electricity also,btohqsg
There are other ways to be sustainable,btohqsg
but if they can come up with renewable source of fuel,btohqsg
But it's political lobbying that's pushing EVs for the next few years,btohqsg
And something else will come up,btohqsg
A new agenda is always required by politicians,btohqsg
And you dont want every vehicle on the road to be 2 tonnes going 0 to 100 in 3s,btohqsg
Someone eventually will be saying  something one,btohqsg
This would be interesting because they're placing the batteries in the middle of the car where the engine is,btohqsg
that will be when people start dying,btohqsg
And they're not going for range maximization by adding more and more battery,btohqsg
But going for 800v charging to charge faster,btohqsg
Hot nt gd for batt.. cold nt gd for batt.. wlwlwlbbql,btohqsg
I just dont think it's gonna work out in the long run la,btohqsg
EVs will hit a wall when the first batch currently running shed their batteriesâ€¦ all at once,btohqsg
There is a reason we dont use nuclear cars,btohqsg
Even though it potentially could let u run a car 20 years without any further input,btohqsg
but also see the reactor how small,btohqsg
But if nuclear powered cars  disposing of the car is another issue,btohqsg
This is what i meant. I was equating it to the rechargeable batteries in modern EVs,btohqsg
just go with those artificial fuel,btohqsg
Yeahh  i think hydrogen fuel is better than EV,btohqsg
What do you want me to do with this,btohqsg
cause i wan use as wallpaper,btohqsg
but like got the tiktok shit,btohqsg
