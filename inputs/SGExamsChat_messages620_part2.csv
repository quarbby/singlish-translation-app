Fuck u for giving me cold shoulder,btohqsg
I'm so glad I'm not part of student council,btohqsg
Otherwise I'll have to welcome ppl by saying WELCOME TO MI,btohqsg

"lmao first day ite can hear ppl shouting ""WELCOME BACK TO ITE""",btohqsg
Make the wise decision not the right decision,btohqsg
Kuro you suck as a role model,btohqsg
And here I thought you're better than a degenerate like me,btohqsg
Dude it's so wild  man I'm deciding a v diff tradeoff,btohqsg
To meet online friend irl at ejc VS help out at my sch open house,btohqsg
Wait who u meeting at ejc,btohqsg
Ejc is so understaffed they need their ALUMNI to support the event,btohqsg
I'll just hang out abit and gtfo if I'm intimidated enough  by the ppl there,btohqsg
Reason why we are top 4/5 in a level performance is because we have decent students,btohqsg
Esp If an alumni says that,btohqsg
My form Cher Kenna transferred to ejc ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Kinda teddy bear liddat wear black frame  specs,btohqsg
He went there last year in the first few months iirc,btohqsg
So not rlly close to our class,btohqsg
WTF HE WAS UR FORM CHER,btohqsg
They get carried by a few chers,btohqsg
He didn't stay with us that long,btohqsg
Iirc my batch lit 80% dist,btohqsg
Alot of the tchers ik all zaos alr,btohqsg
They fucked off cuz of the new principal,btohqsg

What is ej cop these days ah,btohqsg
I rmbr my batch it was 8,btohqsg
But its also cuz they upped the intake,btohqsg
They accepting more students into EJC every year,btohqsg
Which is why the COP doesn't rly fluctuate,btohqsg
Probably to account for the JCs shifting and stuff,btohqsg
So from a logistical standpoint it doesn't make sense to burden them with more srudents,btohqsg
Which is why one cher takes abt 3/4 classes,btohqsg
My batch had abt 4-5 students come back to teach,btohqsg
And geog is normally merged classes,btohqsg
Cuz they dh enough geog students,btohqsg
