Hey any tips on how to get distinction for Chinese oral,btohqsg
oh my the only thing that helped was listening to chinese songs for a whole month ü§£,btohqsg
Flashbacks of YPs on an e-scooter playing Chinese EDM songs on their Bluetooth speakers at Lim Chu Kang during night time.,btohqsg
For me  I don‚Äôt need notes is needed for Chinese oral. I‚Äôm a Sec 3 student takingHigher Chinese and all I do for oral is gather necessary infos for some hot popular topics (ÁÉ≠Èó®ËØùÈ¢òÔºâfrom newspapers etc. And you just need to know the answering technique (PEEL). First question is a personal question  second question is a application question and the last question is a argumentative question. As long as you know what I‚Äôve said above  you should be fine for your Oral.,btohqsg
What do y‚Äôall think will be coming out for the next few days of oral,btohqsg
Is covid-19 and online learning a possibility?,btohqsg

Read more chi books to increase vocab,btohqsg
Then make sure to use it,btohqsg
btw quick qn  do yall think that groups should discuss the workload tgt instead of just throwing it to ppl to do,btohqsg
Really depends on the intensity of the workload. If it requires brainstorming  collaborative thinking or decision-making  it'd be great to discuss it as a group,btohqsg
But if it's a manageable task that can be delegated  then it should be delegated. Saves everyone's time and makes things more efficient,btohqsg
My target I try to get B3 but then I screw up my ppr and listening,btohqsg
