Guys take note this sender. Total 3 drops. Threaten to claim when I'm leaving my 2nd location going towards last location.,btohqsg
You stacked is it Bro? That‚Äôs why? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I will only stack single location,btohqsg
Multiple drop stack hair will drop,btohqsg
In the first place  if sender knows your ETA is 18 mins  he shouldn‚Äôt have waited for you. That just gives him a bullet to claim against you  coz you arrived late  therefore sending of orders late. Same thing applies to Oddle orders that are accepted late  in the end send receiver also late.,btohqsg
Mahmood Tandoor is the worst  I ever kena played by. North Bridge Rd to NUS on a Friday evening  reached within 18 mins also kena complained. Luckily LLM called me to asked for my side of the story plus I give video footage of my in-car cam during pick up and drop off. Case cleared within 2 working days. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
As I said earlier  sender will use your lateness to pick up as a bullet to claim against you.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why don‚Äôt take orders too far away. Speaking from experience.,btohqsg

F-ing cheapos. This fella ordered courier and when I arrived  it was a sound bar‚Ä¶.as long as a bike. I questioned him. He says always use courier. So I asked him to cancel and book again. Too much,btohqsg
"This things keep on happening since a yr ago..For myself  i play safe guys. Accepted order  call customer and asked what item am i collecting  eg size and such. If customer says item is more them 40cm asked them to cancel and book for a car instead. But if customer says just a small item and upon arriving its not. U may report to lalamove as item is oversized for motorbike t&c requirements. From there lalamove will cancel and u may claim 50% cancellation of the stated amount of the delivery fees. Some customer always like to try out their luck. ""And will always says i always order bike no problem"" just show the app and asked them to read thru the T&C.Hope this helps.",btohqsg
Since when the cancellation fee become fix rate? Last time it is 50% of the order amount after comm. Lalamove change pricing without notice or I blur?,btohqsg
I kena baby gate before when on courier üò™,btohqsg
Did you ask for a top up?,btohqsg
No I was riding a bike that time  I just told her I cannot carry and got cancellation charge,btohqsg
3 years on still haven't get the cancellation lol,btohqsg
