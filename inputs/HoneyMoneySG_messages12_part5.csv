U need to commit long term as the miles comes in 14 months delayed. If the event you want to switch card strategy then the miles will be wasted.,btohqsg
Amex and uob absolute card usually they allow you to waive fees anot ah?,btohqsg

ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± I just used my Citi Rewards card on Kris +  but I saw this article that states that I won't get rewards.. feeling so cheated  anyone can verify?https://milelion.com/2022/08/07/review-citi-rewards-credit-card/,btohqsg
Hi anybody know whatâ€™s the merchant code for SingTel bills? Eg for wifi & Tv,btohqsg
Just remember phone app if paid by apple / Google pay is not exactly online transaction.,btohqsg
yea  I thought it was since it's on the app. lucky I only did 1 transaction.,btohqsg
UOB Preferred Platinum Visa not recommended? I feel like there is a gap in my miles game.I maxed the rewards for my HSBC revolution for the month  and needed another card to use,btohqsg
iOS cannot add amaze onto applepay..,btohqsg
I needed a card to fill that gap,btohqsg
I used hsbc and CRMC so far is ok,btohqsg
Kris + with hsbc. Other spend use Crmc,btohqsg
the charge through Kris+ will reflect the merchant's MCC? (eg. dining),btohqsg
then you don't get rewards for HSBC>Kris+ ?,btohqsg
Kris+ is occasional spent for my case . I paid Harvey Norman  Lego all can get the 4mpd. So u need to see what u spend on,btohqsg
Kris+ u need to see their tag at the counter how many miles,btohqsg
oh  so merchant mcc applies to the tx,btohqsg
Read the T&c of the cc,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up shopee pay is considered an online transaction for credit cards?,btohqsg
i think most cards exclude similarly to grab pay?,btohqsg
it is  but prob excluded from rewards as it is a wallet top up,btohqsg
So it isnt worth to top up shopee pay using credit card?,btohqsg
yea amex or uob cashback should be ok,btohqsg
If I apply for the Cashback (minimum spend $800) and I apply for a supplementary for my family member  will it contribute to the minimum spend? (e.g. 2 pax spending $400 monthly)Currently doing this with the uob one for past 2 years and wanna switch. Thanks!,btohqsg
hihi   btw anyone knows if i withdraw from syfe / Webull in USD to DBS multiplier acc  will there be any fees ?,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t it standard that sup cards contribute to the main account  after all itâ€™s 1 account,btohqsg
Is that the same for DBS WWMC?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think so leh  coz I think the tx is considered mobile contactless if it goes through apple pay or Google pay on the phone,btohqsg
Nope. DBS app recognises it as Online/In-app. If its considered mobile contactless  then UOB PPV and VS would earn 4mpd through kris+ too,btohqsg
i thought the UOB cards do earn it,btohqsg
VS shouldn't earn it on kris+. PPV would earn for specific online categories on the PPV whitelist,btohqsg
How much are u looking to spend Monthly?,btohqsg
It's contactless payment. Not online payment,btohqsg
Unless it's in App payment. Similar to Frank card,btohqsg
The case for kris+ is that itâ€™s Apple Pay through an app  no tapping of phone on terminal. So what type is this?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I thought  but milelion says that my Citi rewards wonâ€™t get rewarded.https://milelion.com/2022/08/07/review-citi-rewards-credit-card/Unless there is some exclusion that we donâ€™t see.  Iâ€™ll wait for my statement to come to verify,btohqsg
If it's online it won't be segregated as online and contactless transaction,btohqsg
Anyone here have like dbs vintage card?I don't meet thr 120k annual income but is there like a way to get it via secured credit?,btohqsg

How do I check whether a transaction on CRMC qualifies as a transaction for the sign up promo? I'm paying everything through amaze if that makes a diff,btohqsg
Follow the rule of thumb where if you can get the headline cashback/rewards  meaning non-excluded transactions  it will be eligible. Except Grabpay wallet for Amex tcb,btohqsg
Can I pay my monthly giro income tax with grab MasterCard via e-Axs?,btohqsg
same question  if we're already on the giro plan for income tax  do we need to cancel the plan to pay via axs  or will they recalculate the amount payable per month?,btohqsg
sorry might not be 100% accurate..i paid the entire amount and my outstanding became 0 so no more tax payble owed,btohqsg
