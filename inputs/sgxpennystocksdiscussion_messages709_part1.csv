Yesterday US side showed very strong rejection of lower prices and form good reversal candle with the hammers for most.Also  the last round of pennies run was led first by Asiaphos previously and yesterday Asiaphos did very well in a day where pennies suffered bad.If Asiaphos is to continue power on Monday  I believe many pennies might be led up to do a bullish engulfing candle reversal. If so  be prepared to enter early on Monday day end as a possible penny run should come too.DYODDPS : don’t worry about the Low batt lol. Gonna charge now,btohqsg

https://dollarsandsense.sg/market-downturns-good-chance-review-investment-approach/👆🏿:I don’t need to remind you (your investment dashboard would already tell you) that 2022 has been a poor year for the stock market unless you have been investing only in the Straits Times Index (STI). The S&P 500 (-15%)  Nasdaq-100 (-23%) and Hang Seng Index (-16%) are all down from the start of the year.If you invest in individual stocks such as Alibaba (-22%) and Tencent (-32%) or Sea (-71%)  your losses may be even larger.,btohqsg
