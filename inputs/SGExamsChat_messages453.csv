Their software and design are amazing these couple years,btohqsg

The problems are almost timed to pop up just as the warranty expires,btohqsg
my tab s7 recently entered its third year,btohqsg
i use it very extensively for my work,btohqsg
My Note 4 proximity sensor broke past the 1 year mark  my Note 8 screen developed black spot also past 1 year; never dropped,btohqsg
honestly idk about their phones anymore,btohqsg
but i can vouch for their tablets,btohqsg
And recently my Note20U fell to the famous black screen of death when I changed the battery,btohqsg
Can't be bad luck anymore m8,btohqsg
Just google blacks screen of death samsung,btohqsg
considering i want to change the battery of my note20U,btohqsg
It affects the Note 20 and S21 series,btohqsg

Just look at the number of posts online,btohqsg
at this point i just stick to iphones but samsung tablets,btohqsg
ok but tablet wise samsung vs ipad depends on what exactly you're looking,btohqsg
my Samsung phones last me a few years leh,btohqsg
like my s20 can last 3 years now?,btohqsg
honestly my note20U has lasted me 2years now? Still working very fine  not intending to change it anytime soon but the battery health now is garbage,btohqsg
but i just changed the battery,btohqsg
Pray that it doesn't black screen,btohqsg
i was extremely tempted to switch to s23 hearing that it is snapdragon all around,btohqsg
But not gonna trust it again,btohqsg
mu experience with Samsung is ok leh,btohqsg
like my s22 is my daily,btohqsg
All my samsungs developed problems within 2 years,btohqsg
my only gripe is that the battery life degrades q fast,btohqsg
my mum uses exclusively samsung and uh,btohqsg
tbh the only time they have problems is when she drops it in the toilet bowl,btohqsg
My Note20U battery was still decent after 2 years,btohqsg
cuz i charge when i sleep,btohqsg
The one on Samsung just limits it to 85%,btohqsg

Technically I’ll still wear but just don’t have to fear ppl now telling me to mask up when I just wanna breathe once in a while,btohqsg
it took me a while to feel ok with not wearing mask indoors completely so we will see,btohqsg
I have always worn masks outside,btohqsg
How did I just see this,btohqsg
A thing that protects the medically complex and fragile,btohqsg
I mean  the other day I took off my mask at the zoo  I thought that I was coming down with covid-19 because I was sick with the flu symptoms and ended up having to take a course of antibiotics,btohqsg
