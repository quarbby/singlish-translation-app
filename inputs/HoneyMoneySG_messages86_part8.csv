Afaik  most term plans cover up to 75yo  and only whole life plans will cover up to 99yo.....U can choose whole life plans that let u pay the premiums upfront in 5-20yrs  for whole life coverage ...,btohqsg
Gurus  i tried to roughly calculate i will reach prevailing FRS around year 2039. For that I will need to perform 12-13 x RSTU which will be around 104k reserved for tax relief purpose. Exclude OA to SA transfer. What are the ways to speed up the FRS without so much of RSTU going in reserved except for OA to SA transfer?,btohqsg
One of the most affordable and covers up to 99 year old is Singlife Elite Term. If you get at least 500k sum assured  it's 30% perpetual premium discount. You can go up to 1m for sum assured. Payouts are also guaranteed and is lump-sum.This kind buy early will be better as the premiums will be locked in till end of term.There are other benefits to the policy like riders  policy conversions  coverage increment for key milestones  which I suggest you should approach a Singlife agent to explain to you.IMO  this is the best term policy right now.,btohqsg
Why do you need this though?,btohqsg
I assume you have already maxed MA to BHS.1. If you have yet to hit annual contributions cap  you can look into doing VC3A. The monies will be allocated identically to your mandatory contributions. Your monies that are supposed to go into MA will be transferred to SA without being reserved. You'll also have extra OA to transfer to SA. This method  you'll lose the tax reliefs but you'll increase the speed to hit FRS.2. Addition to point 1  top-up SRS to get tax reliefs instead. Use SRS monies for T-bills and FD.3. Increase your salary  you'll get more contributions to SA  you'll hit FRS faster.,btohqsg
Has Citi nerfed Amaze for bonus points?,btohqsg
Seems like it  or maybe Amaze processing transactions as offline.,btohqsg
Legacy planning😅 betting i cannot live beyond 99yo and leave behind something for my kids😁,btohqsg
Meaning we can’t use citi rewards + amaze for 4mpd for offline transactions already?,btohqsg
Nothing confirmed as of now  but several people did not get 9x bonus for Amaze transactions. I would suggest to stop using for now.,btohqsg
You can check w hsbc life as well  there is a rider that ensures policy matures and pays out death benefit in the event that you live till 100.See if the cost makes sense based on your age,btohqsg

Is it true such policy that covers up to 99 yo also may have 3rd party buyers who may be interested to buy over (hence change policy owner name while maintain  the assured on same person) in future? Heard a fren sharing his idea.. not sure accurate or not😅,btohqsg
Have you tried registering on the website?,btohqsg
Nope. Not yet. Can it be done if I only got acc number?,btohqsg
Would investing be a better alternative instead of getting a term plan till 99?,btohqsg
So far experience in investing too much rollercoaster highs and lows.... older already.. heart not strong for shocks 😅🤣,btohqsg
Even in a diversified portfolio? May I know what will the premiums be like if you get a plan till 99 now?,btohqsg
heard before in the USA.. but not sure if SG got such thingssomething like morbid insurance,btohqsg
yes there are 3rd party that want to buy as investment. Rep holdings is one of them if i not wrong,btohqsg
anyome check with CSO on Citi Rewards/Instarem?,btohqsg
Not sure about this.. but i think i still have funds (maybe in diversified portfolio) that is still over 30% down... stuck in china funds😅,btohqsg
Ahh sorry to hear that. Are these mainly china funds? Have you consulted a financial adviser regarding your plan?,btohqsg
Sigh... my FA back then advised China funds...😅😅😅,btohqsg
Dun dare to contact me so often now...🤣,btohqsg
😅😅😅 ahh again sorry to hear that. Hopefully you’ll meet a better FA (if you do intend to seek counsel from another person). Perhaps you could also explore investing in a more diversified and balanced portfolio if the ups and downs affect you. I can’t imagine insurance companies losing money from selling term plans till age 99.,btohqsg
Does anyone know for UOB one account interest rate  can this min. $500 be across more than 1 eligible card? Or has to be $500 from one card,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how the UOB One debit card transport fare charge?? I recently used my card via iphone to tap into MRT. It didn’t update me about the cost until days later via the UOB app and apple wallet. I was only charged 10cent for just a 1 station stop ride. I’m wondering if all the ride will be just 10cent with UOB one debit?,btohqsg
