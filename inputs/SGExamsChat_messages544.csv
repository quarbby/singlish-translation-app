Is a level ranking of jc important though,btohqsg

IB n A lvls are q similar to each other,btohqsg
ofc rank pts impt it determines which course u go to,btohqsg
I dont think there is a definiteive ranking for the Jcs,btohqsg
its mostly based off the entry points,btohqsg
i mean it depends.. not sure but maybe certain schs are better than others for a certain subj comb? like idk if it‚Äôs true but it‚Äôs going around that cjc has suck science combi,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a variety of factors so like really need to know what exactly you‚Äôre asking,btohqsg

Is it better to learn ahead of syllabus first,btohqsg
i know ppl say do tys last  but as someone who was flopping everything .. my levels were liddistys > assesment books > pyp,btohqsg
Moe changes their syllabus every 4-6 yrs..so your 10 yr series effectiveness is more like 6 year series,btohqsg
cuz tys easy  so chapters that I suck cock  i make sure I at least can do o level standard,btohqsg
I second cohort of new syllabus,btohqsg
Goodluck have fun  i was the last batch of my syllabus,btohqsg
just make sure you understand whatever needs to be learnt,btohqsg
the changes from what i can see is just on how they want students to answer or find answers,btohqsg

or the same type of formats that keep reccuring,btohqsg

i only got A levels as a gauge,btohqsg
our prelim o levels..only 3 out of 28 passed english,btohqsg
even the teachers said  the paper was not easy,btohqsg
because some teacher decided to ask a bunch of random qns nobody learned from,btohqsg
^qns from my sec school...please tell me how to know the correct answer,btohqsg
