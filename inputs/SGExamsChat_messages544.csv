Is a level ranking of jc important though,btohqsg
if you are compaing raffles and Eunoia..not reallybut if you are comparing St Joseph and ACS..yea,btohqsg
IB n A lvls are q similar to each other,btohqsg
ofc rank pts impt it determines which course u go to,btohqsg
I dont think there is a definiteive ranking for the Jcs,btohqsg
its mostly based off the entry points,btohqsg
i mean it depends.. not sure but maybe certain schs are better than others for a certain subj comb? like idk if it’s true but it’s going around that cjc has suck science combi,btohqsg
there’s a variety of factors so like really need to know what exactly you’re asking,btohqsg

you can put in +72hrs for a week,btohqsg
that is basically what you do,btohqsg
provided dont do papers that are out of your syllabus,btohqsg
Is it better to learn ahead of syllabus first,btohqsg
i know ppl say do tys last  but as someone who was flopping everything .. my levels were liddistys > assesment books > pyp,btohqsg
Moe changes their syllabus every 4-6 yrs..so your 10 yr series effectiveness is more like 6 year series,btohqsg
cuz tys easy  so chapters that I suck cock  i make sure I at least can do o level standard,btohqsg
I second cohort of new syllabus,btohqsg
Goodluck have fun  i was the last batch of my syllabus,btohqsg
just make sure you understand whatever needs to be learnt,btohqsg
the changes from what i can see is just on how they want students to answer or find answers,btohqsg

or the same type of formats that keep reccuring,btohqsg

or 20 at prelims and getting 15 at o levels,btohqsg

i only got A levels as a gauge,btohqsg
our prelim o levels..only 3 out of 28 passed english,btohqsg
even the teachers said  the paper was not easy,btohqsg
because some teacher decided to ask a bunch of random qns nobody learned from,btohqsg
^qns from my sec school...please tell me how to know the correct answer,btohqsg
