"I just hope the other ""buyer"" actually exists",btohqsg

Dude was like anything above $x is already a bonus then I'm like even the 5 cent,btohqsg
why do u want the cpf?,btohqsg
isn't the money better in ur hands?,btohqsg
cpf is a safety blanket for people that have no money sense,btohqsg
20% part sure ig if you know what youâ€™re doing (or just not dumb) you can make use of it,btohqsg
problem is once inside  hard to get out,btohqsg
itâ€™s a safety net for retirement,btohqsg
good to have since employer pay the 17% for u,btohqsg
Yeâ€™s problem stuck in forever but the rates r good,btohqsg
oh the one u mention before,btohqsg
then its ok i shall pass,btohqsg
maybe good when elsewhere rates are 0%. but now?,btohqsg
good enough if u lazy to give a fk about investing,btohqsg
but then i would say if u are below 18 and need money  jus ask from the agency,btohqsg
some of them i know wont file coz they dw to pay 17%,btohqsg
yea like i said itâ€™s really a safety net,btohqsg
i could do a lot with the contributions but i understand why itâ€™s there,btohqsg
funny how all the scammers reply exactly the same way lol,btohqsg
this isnâ€™t the place for that unless youâ€™re YR,btohqsg

It's a need for some of my cousins,btohqsg
Cuz they live in msia mah,btohqsg
i feel like driving is difficult,btohqsg
ya   those places legit need car to commute arnd,btohqsg
a license can be useful if you go overseas too bc some countries let you just rent a car with international license,btohqsg
Like if ur family on default dont drive,btohqsg
Then it might be q hard,btohqsg
oh you mean getting driving opportunities,btohqsg
thatâ€™s fair like in sg q a lot of people donâ€™t drive despite having licenses,btohqsg
my fam drives but i donâ€™t often,btohqsg
despite having license for 5 years + alr,btohqsg
but if i have to i can,btohqsg

I want to buy geronimo stilton books now,btohqsg
I was obsessed but i only borrowed from my friends,btohqsg
arenâ€™t there books about his sister now,btohqsg
tbf i cpf is like one of the best thing gov can offer to u,btohqsg
coz they know people with 0 finlit will jus withdraw all they money and yolo away,btohqsg
no choice something gotta do with old uncle yolo life saving to vietnam wife,btohqsg
canâ€™t say that to me when i was alive before geronimo stilton started,btohqsg
cpf is just our pension system,btohqsg
diff is ours no base pension for everyone,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why itâ€™s ranked like 9/44 in pension systems,btohqsg
Is it beneficial if i ask what this is..,btohqsg
What cpf is abt i only know in ss they touch it in the surface,btohqsg
was gonna explain but then saw rand typing,btohqsg
one of my friends work in cpf,btohqsg
she appear on their tiktok lol,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why when we talk about salary itâ€™s usually before they take the 20% away,btohqsg
then we see how much we take home per month,btohqsg
If earn more than 500 then,btohqsg
ngl youâ€™re learning more about cpf then i did before a levels,btohqsg
I earn 550 i nv get 550,btohqsg
i heard abt it q abit,btohqsg
Then i personally went to ask my ss teacher abt it,btohqsg
Idk ss lesson is alw the time for me to ask abt money cos the chapter on like mnc and cpf sparked my interest,btohqsg
So 6k still got cpf charged but after 6k tht money is urs to keep,btohqsg
as in if you earn more than 6k  your cpf calculation is still as tho you earned 6k,btohqsg
Like 1.2k is still taken away,btohqsg
so if you earn 10k  still take away 1.2k,btohqsg
then employer still contribute 17% of 6k,btohqsg
Ehh rlly? idk ss feels like the more relevant subject,btohqsg
"not taken away  it's still ""yours""",btohqsg
i mean in the cpf bank,btohqsg
btw even take home money from salary donâ€™t go yolo bc thereâ€™s still income tax,btohqsg
aus and europe better than malaysia,btohqsg
But maybe i just like ss,btohqsg

3/4 tank upon entering then pump the 1/4 at least in malaysia,btohqsg
a bit more bc they drive q a bit,btohqsg
the stuff i learn from poly and uni are just outdated stuff,btohqsg
itâ€™s more practical and teaches the math behind it,btohqsg
So what is part of uni econs do you think i can learn rn,btohqsg
I bought anime merch in jb,btohqsg
minimum 5 years behind what industry are doing,btohqsg
Tbh right i got so bored after Os,btohqsg

ok sorry not really say outdated but they teach more on fundamentals,btohqsg
my sleep schedule fucked af now anyway,btohqsg
I was talking to my sister abt stocks cos i saw a video on investing and stocks then she asked me if i am still sane,btohqsg
like i took dnt in sec sch  they used lathe and milling machine. but nowadays the minimum is CNC machine,btohqsg
Ah don't u have to live near the custom tho cause I mean Ur fam goes there every Sunday ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
she died on the math part ngl,btohqsg
but she loves the policy aspect,btohqsg
ok  but do u think sec sch can teach how to program the cnc?,btohqsg
even if they could  15 16 yr old me wont bother to learn,btohqsg
but yea she asked me q a bit on how things were derived,btohqsg
I was learning tht last week,btohqsg
Is based off of ur total,btohqsg
At the end of every year,btohqsg
lol imagine taking uni econs cause u can write good essays,btohqsg
i mean she genuinely likes econs,btohqsg
omg i feel so amazing rn i never had the chance to talk abt such stuff to my friends,btohqsg
yes  wish they teach more of this in sec sch,btohqsg
and actually enjoys learning her uni course,btohqsg
but she struggles to translate the math to concepts,btohqsg
They dont even explain tf compound and simpleninterest is,btohqsg
good for her. cause there are actually some ppl who dk uni econs is math heavy and just died there lol,btohqsg
i tot someone said compound interest not taught for jc anymore?,btohqsg
How am i supposed to know how to calculate if i dont understand.,btohqsg
they dont each u this now?,btohqsg
huh? u dun learn AP GP meh?,btohqsg
tbf she didnâ€™t do too well for a levels either so limited choices. like ik sheâ€™d rather do lit or smth but asian parents so she compromised,btohqsg
I understood it after o levels,btohqsg
Cos there was like little to no time to understand everything,btohqsg
i js skipped the interest part,btohqsg
i rmb having a financial literacy class in sec sch,btohqsg
also how is probability useful like what can i use it for,btohqsg
You'll get to learn new things here LOL,btohqsg

but yea quantum mechanics is all probability,btohqsg
so far everyth also good i learn,btohqsg
got differentiation and integration in sec sch ?,btohqsg
Cos i wish i had more time in school,btohqsg
im actually taking econs too and actually this is also what i like about uni econs too. but i dont think i cant speak too early cause in some of the higher-level econs mods the math is gonna get tougher,btohqsg
Cos i cannot tahan the stress,btohqsg
Idk cos my hair does that,btohqsg
i think if your foundation is ok youâ€™ll be fine plus thereâ€™s a good mix of math heavy and conceptually heavy ones,btohqsg
LOL never had a prob with that  just sucked it up and deal with it,btohqsg
Over time you'll get used to it,btohqsg
Am i considered mentally ancient in a young body,btohqsg

For the time he didn't know,btohqsg
i know for sure i donâ€™t belong in boomer mindset,btohqsg
but i will look at kids nowadays and be annoyed,btohqsg

U just seem like the type to not get angry v easily,btohqsg
i hate kids when theyre above 7 and below 15,btohqsg

One time i saw a kid screaming then the kid was nearing me,btohqsg

How to calculate the pricing of my house if sell rn,btohqsg
just nice EC shoot up too much,btohqsg
I genuinely cannot live here anymore my family needs a bigger house,btohqsg
housing prices shot up too fast. In the past 5+ yrs alone EC prices went from 800+ psf to 1300 psf,btohqsg
But overall u pay way much more right?#emath,btohqsg
44% gain in new EC prices.No 44% gain in salaries,btohqsg
yes  but the idea is for the prices to rise at a higher rate than mortgage rates,btohqsg
i like how we have two convos,btohqsg
Oh I thought u meant rand,btohqsg
I mean got other rand  the GP/geog guy,btohqsg
this is the kind of sgexams convo i actually appreciate,btohqsg
for life insurance for my kids  then different story. I pay upfront,btohqsg
Bro's aspiring to work for mappa,btohqsg
iâ€™ve only ever done one art that isnâ€™t digital,btohqsg
I pay 20k over 5 yrs  worth 60k when they 65 yrs old while they are still covered,btohqsg
they actually use investment returns for the insurance portion,btohqsg
Is this for proj/commission/past time/for fun?,btohqsg
I calculated for my insurance agentlife insurance bought at 1 year old to cover till 99almost same as term insurance bought from 30 to 70 yrs old,btohqsg
yes but for 1 Yr old I did the maths,btohqsg
and you still get returns after that,btohqsg
but there's a difference  which is term insurance gets cheaper at higher coverage. I used a lower coverage to calculate,btohqsg
for guys  term insurance go with MINDEF Singlife oneBest value,btohqsg
I didn't know that until few years ago then got back in,btohqsg
alr did  what's the next step,btohqsg
Last time I didn't think about it.Trust me  MINDEF one is the really the cheapest and best value,btohqsg
Welp another reason to make ns compulsory for girls ig LOLL,btohqsg
but in an ideal world perhaps,btohqsg
sign on  or marry a NSman  also qualify,btohqsg
I'm considering personal accident plan next.Didn't get for years. Got the MINDEF one then realise it only covers fractures. That's why super cheap,btohqsg
But if divorce how? No more already?,btohqsg
I only recently realise while it can be done  most insurance don't really have a nomination,btohqsg
Is it v impt to get insurance,btohqsg
My dad nv get us insurance,btohqsg
He say its a waste of money,btohqsg
Idk if we still have it but we used to,btohqsg
gg gonna get flooded by  FA,btohqsg
Insurance is waste of money until u got accident,btohqsg
Usually i would say get insurance is enough  all their investments plan is joke,btohqsg
Unless u know the agent solid one,btohqsg
for your dad important.For you no,btohqsg
put it bluntly  insurance is to protect against downsides  especially if main breadwinner cannot bring in income for any reason,btohqsg
Can i get unsurance for my daf,btohqsg
if you are not the main breadwinner  anything happens to you your family will still go on well financially.,btohqsg
Health is another kind of insurance. Most Singaporeans are somewhat covered by MediShield,btohqsg
its hard to live as an adult,btohqsg
Usually there are two types u need  one is for say anything touch wood need stay inside hospital den insurance will cover for his most of his bill and yall pay the remainingAnother one is accident  where if u kena accident can claim from insurances,btohqsg
I donr want to grow up,btohqsg
At least im mentally preparing i guess,btohqsg
Abit no shit sherlock but Life one best find those with death insured for 1 mil,btohqsg
the second one is a subtle ouch to me,btohqsg
This is why people are so greedy for money is it,btohqsg
why u dragging em into a vortex,btohqsg
Since insurance technically is using your money to pay for the claims,btohqsg
U will be surprised by how greedy and desperate some ppl can be,btohqsg
i want to live in the time where people traded goods,btohqsg
No shame in doing it btw,btohqsg
Money is just paper and like tokens,btohqsg
You can't take it with u when you're gone tho lol,btohqsg
When u grow older u will realise everyone live with agendas,btohqsg
Its so useless imo if in stranded on an island with 1 billion in cash i cant do anyth w it,btohqsg
People wont suddenly come up to u and give u freebies,btohqsg
personally I don't have disability income,btohqsg
i mean we hear this all the time ah,btohqsg
don't have accident one yet too.,btohqsg
U do realise working 9-5 not gonna get u retired soon right,btohqsg
It's not wrong if u think abt it,btohqsg
correct but i know i cant do anyth w it,btohqsg
The insurance agents near mrts gonna love u,btohqsg
Supermarket freebies uk those cereal box and free bowl,btohqsg
Abit like social studies where everything is a hidden agenda behind it,btohqsg
â€œWhat can u tell from the picture â€œ,btohqsg
Oh ya i also love taking those,btohqsg
The what light up see thru balloon,btohqsg
freebie is when I answer a question in the O or A lvl grp for free,btohqsg
thats cool i can never feel tht way,btohqsg
ya I don't expect anyone to feel that way anyway cuz it's genuinely meant to help,btohqsg
or like when i go open hse,btohqsg
Free tote bag free bottle free shirt,btohqsg
such free stuff are called lead magnets in marketing,btohqsg
yes i thabk u for helping me this entire year for physics,btohqsg
Its okay ure doing gods work sir u help alot of kids like me,btohqsg
to add on to thiswhenever you take a free marketing stuff  there are reasons behind itOf course if it's done wrongly it's another story,btohqsg
no no. It's all in numbers in marketing,btohqsg
from lead generation via lead magnets to lead conversion etc,btohqsg
Ya sia must cremate to ensure proper burial,btohqsg
simple way of puttinginsurance agents waving a lead magnet to attract a lead overOnce you go over  they begin the process of lead conversion,btohqsg
You can't just set someone on fire or add them to compost bin,btohqsg
if you give your contact  they follow up with lead nurturing,btohqsg
took me quite a few years to understand,btohqsg
Marketing which alot of ppl fall for,btohqsg
And sometimes inevitable cos u would need it,btohqsg
that's not even the main marketing yet  just a small portion of it,btohqsg
Cos they lower the price for student meal,btohqsg
Bro listen to me some insurance agent approached me while I was in cosplay like the balls of steel was REAL,btohqsg
that's similar to tuition centre free trials,btohqsg
I thought that agent was genuinely interested in my cosplay,btohqsg
Later proceed to find some opening in the way I manage my finances and what not,btohqsg
told u u will start to realise how despo they can get,btohqsg
I ever got one bank promoter call me  need to borrow money a not? Got special offerI said don't needThen he went like.... huh you don't need to borrow any money?,btohqsg
Then when I realize I said that thing  that trigger  dude prob had an evil grin within,btohqsg
""" come come it'll only take abt 5 min """,btohqsg
Ok but among all i feel mlm is the worst,btohqsg
Oh sorry ah I kinda in a rush rn but it was nice talking to you,btohqsg
you want to see hard closers of sales.... just visit a wedding photography studio,btohqsg
