Is it teaching or go HQ? Going HQ has no children involvement,btohqsg
At HQ you deal with old geezers with too many policy power and massive budgets to spend,btohqsg
I don't think I'll be able to stand pri or sec students,btohqsg
If you take MOE TS you have to go to school for 2 years I think,btohqsg
After that you can just hide in HQ,btohqsg
i didnt know u were an avid investor,btohqsg
I think this is what my fellow intern is planning to do,btohqsg
Only if you can afford it tho  lmao,btohqsg
ye man they are showing a small rebound from their fall earlier,btohqsg
She has 44 IB she can do whatever she wants,btohqsg
prob still shy of the 50th percentile of rp scores an A lvl grad in MOE JCTIP has,btohqsg
I might actually consider MOE tho,btohqsg
Do 2 years and hide in HQ? I feel so sorry for the guinea pigs in that 2 years,btohqsg
Theoretically speaking DSTA is not a horrible stat board,btohqsg
its horrible though cos of the toxicity,btohqsg
but if u can handle it  ur life isnt that bad,btohqsg
speaking of that  my friend is prob gonna get destroyed and stay in the lower rungs potentially for life,btohqsg
There are stat boards which scream AVOID AVOID EVADE EVADE PERFORM EVASIVE MANEUVERS NOW,btohqsg
thats why i nvr considered it,btohqsg
Not all places tossic tho I think,btohqsg
CAG and CAS different things by the way,btohqsg
Oh ya  missed one A out,btohqsg
I don't think they would participate even if they were here,btohqsg
actually the most shiniest of them all is Jardine,btohqsg
Shiniest is father-mother scholarship with holidays during undergrad time fully paid for,btohqsg
So 1 undergrad year 2 or more trips,btohqsg
maybe to Cologne or something 'CULTURAL TRIP',btohqsg
I think there's at least one psc scholar in this group tho,btohqsg
Means you go fly Paris buy 2 LV tab fully settled,btohqsg
I think he means statistically  at least 1 out of 2000 group members is a PSCholar,btohqsg
You can go overseas for no reason and they'll still pay for it?,btohqsg
What tier? PSC also tiered like mad today,btohqsg
I'm afraid it's doxxing tho even though I'm not exactly sure if that person is psc,btohqsg
You have a specific person in mind?,btohqsg
Well  I assume you never seen the party goers with infinite money before,btohqsg
In some sense they also don't only get PSC scholars in eleetus part of SG Govt any more,btohqsg
With more mid-career switches allowable and all,btohqsg
Yeah I saw one poly person in the psc awardee list in 2018,btohqsg
No I don't mean they diversify the PSCs themselves  I mean like if you are some SGean without problematic security background (e.g. You go to Grace Assembly and are a young Divisional Director in UBS you are welcome to join the high ranks of SG's Civil Service),btohqsg
Even though said person may never have done anything related to civil service ever,btohqsg
As for token diversification  well  it's done by all oligarchies. Can't maintain the illusion of a democracy without the tokens,btohqsg
Hii has anyone taken the ucat test before? Can pm me thankss!,btohqsg
And then I'll offer to give soon's children tuition,btohqsg
I'll smack my kids until they learn to study on their own,btohqsg
no tuition squad where yall at,btohqsg
smack them with a bat or what,btohqsg
it doesn't work unless they're traumatized by it,btohqsg
smack them wit that guilt trip,btohqsg
"""i work so hard and i try my best to giveu  guys a happy childhood but yall too lazy to study haiz.. i dont know where i went wrong""",btohqsg
”I raise you for x number of years feed you bathe you but still so unappreciative 不要好好学习”,btohqsg
