Zai la.. Heaven hand leh.. I upgraded from diamond long ago,btohqsg
Ya kamsia master...learnt something today haha,btohqsg
I think likely u elder than meüòÇ,btohqsg
aiyo  just avoid property counters  then we can be more focus on certain counters - fundamental and coming results  but just beware that some counters might encounter selling on news !!,btohqsg
JT will be blessed with your heaven hands üôè,btohqsg
I waiting for my 60cents avarga,btohqsg
Hmm.. No wor.. Hold until fundamental change,btohqsg
Depending on dividend also...if like hph then don't mind holding,btohqsg
So I believe this round chor,btohqsg
This full year u est how much?,btohqsg
U will hear me say the same everytime la lol,btohqsg
U sure u want to ask? Lol,btohqsg
Div I think around same if not abit more. Esp if taiga pays out to avarga directly then got more to distributeWhere‚Äôs their listing and sale thoughOr maybe earnings accretive acquisition using shares also good,btohqsg
Minimum 40% of net profit.. Company promised.. Hope they give 80% of net profit lor,btohqsg
Better give more this time.. Else the share price stuck forever,btohqsg
So CPH tomorrow got show or not ?,btohqsg
Dunno le. If break 46 high chance,btohqsg
please check their dividend policy  if im not wrong  not less than 40% of the net profit !!,btohqsg
Really all the Lumber counters moving.. Only avarga nv move as much... Funny sia,btohqsg
I vested in both CPH and CSF,btohqsg
I smell rat.. Trust gut feeling.. 60cents soon,btohqsg
Think they can‚Äôt do buyback now. Blackout period.,btohqsg
Previously got a team of buyers.. Suddenly all missing,btohqsg
Meaning today's buy up is solid,btohqsg
1 more week to result...May see more ups,btohqsg
The consolidating phase way too long.. Weird,btohqsg
Looking at Avarga's movement...I don't see it will go 5 series soon,btohqsg
Pe ratio 10x.. OK 70cents avarga.. Good night,btohqsg
Can see 4 series already tao chio,btohqsg
But I hope can see this man,btohqsg
But.... I still believe it will happen,btohqsg
Nothing speculative.. Just some actual  PE calculation,btohqsg
Wait 22 Feb will know liao,btohqsg
Not holding my breath though. 4Q winter is typically a weak quarter for construction,btohqsg
Guys paiseh cos now i working seldom online,btohqsg
Then I think will run.. See a lot of report on good weather during winter. ..,btohqsg
They factor in the weak.. But actually turns out strong..,btohqsg
Quick ah public bank why so slow,btohqsg
These few days consolidate gao gao,btohqsg
Like they say in the cinemas.... AKAN DATANG... Coming SoonüòÉüòÖüëç,btohqsg
Sales revenue q3 q4 on Par.. They didn't mention about weak sales on q4..only weaker Lumber price,btohqsg
For a moment I thought taiga so huat,btohqsg
Matching performance ba.. Lower value only..,btohqsg
Taking 2019 as reference the Q1 and Q4 span over winter will be weaker sales,btohqsg
SeasonalityTaiga‚Äôs sales are subject to seasonal variances that fluctuate in accordance with the normal home building season. Taiga generally experiences higher sales in the quarters ended June 30 and September 30 and reduced sales in the late fall and winter during its quarters ended December 31 and March 31 of each fiscal year.,btohqsg
Ya.. Analyst all estimate much lower on winter.. Norm case..,btohqsg
The buyback says a lot more,btohqsg
Securitized debt cheap cheap. Equity buyback is good move. They do a good balance between both,btohqsg
