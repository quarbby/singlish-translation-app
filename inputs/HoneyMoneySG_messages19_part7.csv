Isn‚Äôt grab top up to cdc there is a $1 fee to every $100 top up?,btohqsg
GPMC is debit card so free top up to CDC. Been doing it recently  can confirmed no fees. Fees only for credit card if not wrong,btohqsg
1.7% cashback from UOB AMEX Absolute top up to GPMC. No other earn I think but CDC only accept MC/Visa not Amex.,btohqsg
In short: You may consider investing in stocks bah,btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt the FDs lower than UOB One ah (much more liquid and if you have card spend anyway  reasonable). If really no idea and don‚Äôt want to deal with UOB One  then yeah may take the FDs you recommend bah üëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
Correct. Will discuss in todays video,btohqsg
Any credit card earn points from paying to a doctor specialist?,btohqsg
yes use UOB PPV if accept paywave (private specialist) or use NUH one app pay online use Citi Rewards MC (for NUH specialist). Based on my own experience last few months. Got 4 mpd,btohqsg
HSBC revo most likely not get,btohqsg
Just thought if amaze gets nerfed. Can still link CitiRewards card to LiquidPay and make QR payments for FnB/Retail expenses to earn 10x pts  as it still classified as online payment üòÖ,btohqsg
When a major nerf happens  there will be two groups of people:1) Ranting and whining about the nerf and cannot get over it2) Move on and find new hacks going forward. No big deal.Hint: Don't be in the first group,btohqsg
Can just check if uob1 credit card pay ntuc income insurance also consider spending right?,btohqsg
Now haven‚Äôt nerf also can link to right,btohqsg
1 card can link to multiple account,btohqsg
Hi all  I just recieved my citi rewards + instarem amaze cards and am gathering some tips on how to use it (was previously using amex -> grab/youtrip as 1 card solution but decided to shift after nerfs) Do you all use instarem amaze as 1 card solution for everything in SG to earn 4mpd? any exclusions to take note off? Should I change all my billing (i.e.  netflix  spotify  fitness first  telco plan) to instarem amaze card?,btohqsg
Just tried.Looks like can.But I didn't complete the transaction as I have already paid.Will update next month,btohqsg
Agree. If have new hacks just make hay / do these hacks. If no hack or nerf then at most shrug lor,btohqsg
Need to wait 90-120days to redeem the offer,btohqsg
Best hack to fall back on is always Marie Kondo ConceptSpend less and minimalist  never go wrong.,btohqsg
No 4 mpd or ‚Äú3.33% cashback‚Äù Also can. üëçüèª,btohqsg

If you spend more than $600 a month  do consider UOB EVOL + UOB One. Link above,btohqsg

hey guys  just curious on how to read CitiReward point breakdown statement. Above points transactions dated 4 Dec  does it related to the payment transaction made with credit card on 4 Dec?,btohqsg
Just used grapcard to pay for uniqlo. 0 pts.,btohqsg
more like posted on 4 dec,btohqsg
I think FairPrice app for kopi tiam  supermarket  shopback  fave pay  grab all deemed as online pay so don‚Äôt worry *for now*,btohqsg
Using uob one card for the 5% ACB merchants vs SCB smart card for ‚ÄúSimplyGo‚Äù.Which is better?,btohqsg
Amex true cash backDoes it still earns 1.5%Grab top up ?,btohqsg
Just wondering I applied the uob saving acc nowThen the 1-5 dec ending cuz i dun have the bank accAnyways about it? Or most likepy missed,btohqsg
My bad  thought you were referring to the hawker 50c off promo. I'm not sure how this one works.,btohqsg
First come first serve  fully redeem,btohqsg
Such promotion maybe fully redeem without any notice  only spend then u know get or not. Exact redemption is not reveal as like any promotion,btohqsg
Query: Why cant i sell a cash secured put on Webull SG? I have the margin account and the cash in the account to cover my stock price.I keep getting the prompt: Short Selling Options is currently not supported.,btohqsg
Which bank provide the best FD rate?,btohqsg
UOB Privi Miles can also  but you only need to pair it for oversea/Foreign currency transactions. Locally no need to use amaze except for convenience of just bringing one amaze card.,btohqsg
Citi one is quite tough to see whether miles are awarded for which transactions. Yeah most prob date of transaction posted. I prefer UOB in this aspect of transparency   they show itemised on miles earned etc.,btohqsg
not true  uob prvi mastercard  uob lady  uob krisflyer should work with Amaze so long MCC eligible,btohqsg
Hello! Silly question.Is it better to be doing voluntary housing loan payment or topping up to CPF OA to enjoy tax relief?,btohqsg
Likely they'll push out more features of options trading in future  which may include selling naked/cash covered options...,btohqsg
1) No  since interest rates outside of CPFOA is easily 3-4%.2) You cannot top-up to OA directly  so not even for tax relief,btohqsg
Yup.... Just sharing what I've heard on other chatgrps....,btohqsg
For first card folks it is still the same to me as 40 yo folksEveryone's use case is differentIf really don't know any better  use a debit card first and see which one you spend on  the total amounts  proportion etcbe honest  which kind of spending is every month sure have  which kind of spending is need  and which kind variable.For now  UOB EVOL might be the card to go if paired with UOB One account  though be careful of conditions that are Unlike Other Banks,btohqsg
If you're a miles guy or into it sure (and yes it's my one card to go before the 1k cap)  exceptions when I dont use the card is for SimplyGo  insurances and travel related expenses,btohqsg
Hi  I have an upcoming prudential insurance payment. Would like to find out if there is any credit card or method to pair cards together for cashback/miles.,btohqsg
Pretty much is the 1.5/1.7 amex card with grabpay before it is nerfed..,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL card  is it possible to get more than $40 cashback after hitting the $500 spend in mobile contactless and online categories by spending the remaining $100 on visa payWave transactions?,btohqsg
