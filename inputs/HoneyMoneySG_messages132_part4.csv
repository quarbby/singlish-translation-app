Hi guys  I understand that Citi Rewards exclude travel-related expenses like booking of airlines  hotels etc.Can I check does it exclude overseas expenditures as well? Such as shopping  dining etc.I’m looking to pair it with amaze for overseas transactions.Thanks!,btohqsg
Suggest he better make a few trade or what. To showcase he interested in trading. Doing just for fx will result it ban forever.,btohqsg
I have used ibkr for a few years  but i dont really trade on it,btohqsg
"hence i said ""also using it for Investments already""",btohqsg
actually the 'using IBKR for FX Conversions only'... resulting in account closure  i only HEARSAY only..anyone here is an ACTUAL DP?,btohqsg
I think leading up to the fx conversion i perform a few more trades bah,btohqsg
Thank you for your help everyone  appreciate it 🙏,btohqsg
Yes. At least have some saying. Also keep a bit. Don't one shot all. Maybe spread into 2 times.,btohqsg
No it doesn't. Shopping and dining overseas should be fine. Just be careful when eating at restaurant inside hotel. That may be coded as hotel.,btohqsg
Ya actually 2x better. Im intending to convert from USD back to SGD as well  but i never tried funding ibkr using USD before lol,btohqsg
"I read and was quite shocked by this:IpSo_FrAtO•5mo agoI got a permanent restriction from depositing USD into a CAD base currency IB account  waiting a few months for the exchange rate to be most favorable  then converting it to CAD and at some later time withdrawing only about 10-25% of the total funds. I always deposited more (USD) than I withdrew. Additionally I was making some ETF investments too  but only about 10% of the total funds  as their cash interest rates are too good right now. I had been doing this for 5+ years until getting the first notice last summer  and permanent ban last week.Their ""rules"" are quite vague though. If you can only withdraw in the currency you deposit  how does it work when you have investment gains/losses? ie: I deposit 1000 USD and 1000 CAD  convert the USD to CAD (1300 CAD)  so now I have 2300 CAD  I then invest it for a while and it goes up to 2500 CAD. How much CAD and how much USD can I withdrawal?What if I deposited 10K USD over the last year  and withdrew 13K CAD  got the ban on my account  do I have to ""catch-up"" by withdrawing 10K (or 13K?) USD now before I can withdraw any CAD again?Unfortunately their support department is of no help  and you can't talk to their compliance department.I wonder if Norberts Gambit/Journaling Shares or position transfers in of USD ETFs  sell  convert currency  withdraw  would avoid these bans?FYI: For people mentioning IB does this to make a profit  I don't think that is the reason behind it  as I know someone that had $10M+ in funds with IB getting the same ban. So they lost a ton of business from that person alone. Additionally their emails state its a regulation issue. ""Please note that straight currency conversions (deposit in currency ""A""--> convert to currency ""B""--> withdrawal in currency ""B"") are considered MSB (""Money Service Business"") type of activities. "" -- I assume IB isn't registered as a MSB  as they are a broker instead.",btohqsg
I guess too many people using this loophole as money exhange,btohqsg
Wah toh  my trade volume wont be near anywhere 350k sgd thougj,btohqsg
Ya prob regulation prevents them from doing so. Their license is for a specific thing like broker  not bank.,btohqsg
well from what i read.. u get one chance,btohqsg
how is this a loophole.. it is a feature of IBKR which they want to be used as complimentary to trades.. and not the main reason to use IBKR,btohqsg
someone I knew last time got the query too from the compliance team upon exchanging few Million usd to sgd. Until he comment he will trade more at ibkr. Then get lifted on the matters. So they do check on this.,btohqsg
i am using that 'feature' myself buy and sell SGD USD AUD EUR HKD securities.. then switching currencies based on FX movement to make even more gains.,btohqsg
I let you guys know how it goes in 1 month time,btohqsg
In the mean time i will be more active on the app,btohqsg
considering they list Spot FX trading as one of the Activities  I am actually quite disappointed they will slap you if you only use Spot FX function of IBKR,btohqsg
but touch wood so far i never kenna that message..i think they also look at period of time the money stays in IBKRif go in say 1st October... FX converted.. exit 15th October.. they will warn youif go in 1st October.. fx convert to B to C to D... exit 1st December.. should be ok,btohqsg
Pass by at 2+pm  quite a lot of ppl outside,btohqsg
Yes. Just don't immediately transfer out. Or maybe can invest in US tbills in secondary market for a month or what then transfer out. Of course provided u not in a hurry in getting the money.,btohqsg
eh u all smarter a bit la... don't make life difficult for Admin.if you are asking questions  phrase it properly so it can have ZERO CHANCE to be interpret as soliciting  which is not allowed.,btohqsg
actually IBKR should publish the rules of engagement  or at least a ROUGH IDEA... so people know what is acceptable what is not..,btohqsg
actually they list tight spreads as one of their USPs,btohqsg
their FX feature is to faciliate non base currency investments,btohqsg
they also advertise they offer FX trading!,btohqsg

So troublesome? Everytime need request",btohqsg
Looks like banks are introducting tighter blocks due to the multiple scams happening. My wife Stanchart account was locked after she tried to perform a funds transfer. It took 4-5 phone calls and 9 hours later for the bank to remove the internet banking block. Ridiculous.,btohqsg
what is meant by request to bypass the merchant?,btohqsg
CSO ask me is it you perform blablabla transaction from Malaysia?i said yes  then she said will request to bypass then i will able to do transaction again after 1 hourbut i already paid using other credit card and left the restaurant already. What is the point -.-,btohqsg
It's good security. Or you can pay by youtrip.,btohqsg
