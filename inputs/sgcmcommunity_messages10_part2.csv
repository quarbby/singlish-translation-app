Pardon me for being sounding condescending  I also feel clinging on the ICE era also doenst make sense.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 17 more years. Still damn long. A new born today would be going for NS in that time line,btohqsg
Ya ice is gone for sure alreadg,btohqsg
in case anyone is not aware  2 stroke engine vehicles are not longer allowed to renew coe,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just that we no choice. No price parity makes us average car owners very hard to switch.,btohqsg
Donâ€™t buy new ice car just buy a 2nd hand will do,btohqsg
I think the dilemma comes when it is late 2020 going to 2030. Then the qns is your next car is EV or hybrid or ICE. Now seems quite clear,btohqsg
When car manufacturers already said they will stop producing   donâ€™t challenge them,btohqsg
Unless u got too much money to burn,btohqsg
I donâ€™t care. I want to keep my e30. By 2025 Iâ€™ll turn it into classic status,btohqsg
I think buying EV car is burning more. Like what many said earlier  price disparity  ownership and inconvenience just make EV not that super attractive now.,btohqsg
Btw is xpeng coming to singapore,btohqsg
Ya itâ€™s a legit question.Im also considering hard whatâ€™s next aft the 5 year warranty expires.,btohqsg
Actually the petrol saving is alot   and there is 40 k arf rebate a new mg or byd is really ok for the price   where is the price disparities?,btohqsg
Anyway. Is for discussion. We are not saying that ppl who get EV now is dumb or financially illogical.We just say that we wish Tesla is cheaper and more charging port.We farmer. Not that rich ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Tesla is not a mass market car,btohqsg
Thier cheapest car cost around an e class,btohqsg
Though in the US  so many of them makes me think they are actually trying to be.,btohqsg
Not all of them passing the rebates leh.,btohqsg
China excels better in cheaper EVs. haha,btohqsg
We are proud of those early adopters because their feedback will shape the future driving norms in sg.Just that We will probably be later adopter,btohqsg
Got more and more choices alr.,btohqsg
All thatâ€™s left right is actually just the way EVs are taxed,btohqsg
Once these 2 are solved  itâ€™ll be better alr for motorists.,btohqsg
Need to have some big policy change to trigger the tipping point,btohqsg
Ya. I will probably a new vezel then 5 years later sell it off for electric car.Looking at BZ4 Toyota EV SUV,btohqsg
Ya BZ4X is a good choice.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just a small downside that thereâ€™s no driver memory  otherwise itâ€™s comparable in terms of performance and practicality.,btohqsg
It will be a win so long cars like Honda E gets cheaper. We dont need powerful tesla,btohqsg
Overseas reviews for this car are quite positive. 207hp is quite usable also.,btohqsg
All these are just marketing to win people over ICE,btohqsg
Ya. Will sell my Car next year  get new ICE with 5 years warranty. Just nice 2029 will get EV. Hopefully will have much much more EV options and more charging ports as promised,btohqsg
Pfft  my car was 44bhp and no one complained back then,btohqsg
What I cannot accept is  BNB EVs are categorised largely as Cat B,btohqsg
And well  all new stuff in the market are always position as a premium,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just modern battery and motor technology that has improved overall for the auto industry.,btohqsg
I believe policy will change. If they are sincere about having full EV then I think we will see more cars in CAT A,btohqsg
The criteria should be updated for sure.,btohqsg
Totally donâ€™t make sense to have Ioniq 5  ID4  EV6 which are clearly mass market,btohqsg
To be categorised as Cat B.,btohqsg
We need more econobox electric cars  not tesla with sports car horsepower.,btohqsg
Honda E for a family isnâ€™t very practical if thatâ€™s what you are referring to,btohqsg
Itâ€™s too small alr. Minimally a Model 3 size.,btohqsg
Yes  but we need more of these things to have mass market adoption.,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s alr the Kona EV long range alr. Which in fact  the range is the one thatâ€™s making it less attractive.,btohqsg
All those Cat A meets the size and practicality but loses out on range.,btohqsg
I cannot imagine for those who use for long distances get by with a 30+kWH battery.,btohqsg
Yes ev is different as small power means small battery haha,btohqsg
Ya we just need to have a nice balance.,btohqsg
The cat a and b model is outdated,btohqsg
