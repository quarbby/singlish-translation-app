there was once i nearly went from early to late coz when i was abt to alight  my bag stuck to the seat  then the bus never wait for me and i had to walk back from the next bus stop,btohqsg
the route i take is mostly along expressway anyways,btohqsg
Idk ah cause of the age of the photo? Looks like a pre 2000s photi,btohqsg

luckily walkable distance (idk how to estimate) and i was feeling well that day (coz i tend to feel grudgy in the morning),btohqsg
tdy i make sure to wake up slightly earlier so i wouldnt risk being late and then ended up being late by 5 mins,btohqsg

Let me guess was it the mercedes citaro,btohqsg
"then the teacher say as he scan my ezlink ""THIRD TIME""",btohqsg

Last time when I took 81,btohqsg
Then show HE LOCK THE DOOR IS IT BECAUSE I AM CHINESE?,btohqsg
no cpas bus stop is the next one,btohqsg
Got this one traffic junction take so long sia,btohqsg
the tmjc bus stop is right at door step and the opposite one is just cross a bridge,btohqsg
unless they meant the one at the main gate,btohqsg
bus stops that are placed just before a traffic light are like,btohqsg
Maybe the bus door on auto lock.,btohqsg
sometimes got nice driver see traffic light  they just wait at the bus stop for more people,btohqsg
then bus 3 just before reaching the main gate bus stop got traffic light,btohqsg
This bus is known to have seats with a very small gap so if your bag straps falls through the seat gaps it gets stuck,btohqsg
ohhh u came frm the other side ah? frm ws?,btohqsg
oh i never see the bus model lol,btohqsg
It's been a long ass prob alr  it's always this particular bus,btohqsg
bruh if just as the bus abt to leave then suddenly turn red and i'm alr in a rush,btohqsg
U know the hammer for the bus yes u go whack the hammer on the glass,btohqsg

Ppl say bmw (middle right) can scrap alr,btohqsg
maybe the 10 years is up,btohqsg
cuz the extent of the damage is too much alr,btohqsg
repair works might be worth more then carüíÄ,btohqsg
Yep  there are some damages to a car that will instantly write off a car irregardless of how bad it looks.That is the roof and chassis and mainframe. If a car chassis  roof or mainframe has been damaged  the car will be written off,btohqsg
damn. at least they upgraded to a 500k big vehicle (bus),btohqsg
I feel like I'm too attached to my jc and I don't want to graduate ;(,btohqsg

That's literally what I told the rest..üíÄ,btohqsg
Fr dying in class in rp,btohqsg

New leader  new rules  new learning,btohqsg
Pbl  basically the whole lesson you are taught techniques and info to create a presentation through a problem that is given,btohqsg
ohhh i tot he typo lmao,btohqsg
Then present said ideas etc and that will add to your daily grades,btohqsg
Np's dailo got transferred to rp...so you can guess what rp is doing,btohqsg
Our current principal was formerly principal of nyp for 7 years,btohqsg
hopefully rp becomes tp north or smth,btohqsg
"my cher said ""you will see"" when i asked her abt my mark i tot was good lol",btohqsg
Won't be so soon  our cutoff will retain because rp takes in 3.9k students,btohqsg
alit of ppl fail tho appaently,btohqsg
if highest was 23  u r one of the top few alr,btohqsg
Pbl gives you a better chance to score. Because as long as your group 4 has a understandnable presentation. You as a group of 4 easily gets a daily grade of B if everyone plays their part. Irregardless of quiz results,btohqsg

Student council president elections this friday,btohqsg
I can already tell who will win,btohqsg
i stg i see so many random students on insta w their promotional vids,btohqsg

i cld have asked to add on,btohqsg
Someone who has been popular and active in school since Y1 + many of my juniors know her vs someone who I can't even recognize her face if I saw her irl,btohqsg
Ok ya that one makes sense,btohqsg
I deadass didn't pay attn at all,btohqsg
for our sch pres is y1-y6 vote,btohqsg
Idk what the fuck is the pt,btohqsg
and its like 1 class 2 facilitators  or smt,btohqsg
so like lets say this girl A was in student council since y3 and orientation leader in y2  then she has her CCA juniors  plus very active in the school  then she running against some JAE kid  it's q obvious that the Junior High votes will be heavily skewed in favour of the Ip girl,btohqsg
So even if alot of Senior High votes for the JAE  the Ip girl still has a statistically higher chance to win,btohqsg
It's almost no point to run for pres,btohqsg
I mean tbh there is a chance that a JAE could be pres BUT the chances are very slim,btohqsg
But I remember in my y1/y2  both contestants were IP,btohqsg
Then it's a bit more difficult to predict who will win since both are popular,btohqsg
No I don't like to be involved in politics,btohqsg
I saw the candidates and I was like,btohqsg
U can already know who will fill 2 of the 3 spots...,btohqsg
i tot rand got banned? diff rand?,btohqsg
J2s shall know these dudes are the ones that are gonna help you grad with a better sch experiment,btohqsg

President election is y1 - y6,btohqsg
i wonder why he didnt ask me,btohqsg

"I mean I wouldn't call it ""unreasonable"" considering there is a reason. Especially since you need to pass O levels CL to enter O level HCLBut at the same  she still needs to balance her other academics and hw.",btohqsg
Plus i dont think there are rlly much resources on CL oral,btohqsg
everything is useless except subjects that matter,btohqsg
