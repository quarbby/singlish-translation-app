Now moomoo have bond promotion for $100k so trying to move there. Called hsbc 2 hrs ago until now their fraud detection dept haven't call back to unblock.,btohqsg
U triggered their fraud alerts.Expect a call from South Asia team tomorrow,btohqsg
When I called Hsbc Premier   the lady says many on going fraud case reported recently so they increasing their security level to stop large transfers. I told them moomoo is my existing payee transfer many times in past months  why their system will trigger fraud  she can't answer.,btohqsg
Hahahaa probably they don't even use these records to filter their automation. If they are so advanced  the website would have been updated with Aug HSBC EGA promo already.,btohqsg

HSBC cards are always standalone by itself. Separate limit separate statement.,btohqsg
Talking about hsbc limit. My HSBC t1 got 600 limit ü§∑,btohqsg
I suspect they lowered it cuz I refused to spend them a copy of my staff pass. ü§™,btohqsg
My banking transfer limit per time is also reduced to $2k / time after trigger fraud alert.So if I want to transfer $100k  I need to do 50 times.,btohqsg
I applied probably late June and I have yet to received my statementHaving said that I also made a request to hsbc in July for the statement date to be on 2nd of the monthSo I‚Äôm guessing maybe tmr I will receive my statement,btohqsg
The uob Uni points deduction happened for the annual fees in app but when I applied for the waiver it is showing me this anyone experienced it before?,btohqsg
