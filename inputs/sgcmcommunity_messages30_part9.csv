Solution is to create a separate COE category for cars meant for PHV rentals for EV/HEVs,btohqsg
Cat F for EV  it can go to the moon,btohqsg
They won't separate PHV and normal cars because the idea is to limit car population  so the common man on the street gets to compete with the big corporations like grab and gojek,btohqsg
last time teksi was same pool.,btohqsg
Phv too open already ma  so now let then ownself fight ownself,btohqsg
