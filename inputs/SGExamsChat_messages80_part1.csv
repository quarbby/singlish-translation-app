Isn‚Äôt moonlight like a second job,btohqsg
He have a second job at night?,btohqsg
He's such a nice guy minus the abuse part. He thinking of the future and work two job to satisfy the gf,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the deal breaking part of moonlight tho,btohqsg
True  maybe the abuse is just scolding  I mean all relationship have argument also,btohqsg
Even then if you construe minor arguments as abuse then it‚Äôs not abuse but it is incompatibility that is the deal breaker,btohqsg
"""EVEN moonlighted during his whole NS""   that seem like a pretty serious issue@Holdyourplace",btohqsg
Are u JC or poly or uni,btohqsg
U will be a good counsellor,btohqsg
Now uk why i say necessity,btohqsg
Tbh moonlighting i think is a grey thing,btohqsg
Because I get too attached to things  I‚Äôll bring my clients worries home and stress myself out,btohqsg
True  but it shows ure good at it and u truly care,btohqsg
U will make a good partner for whomever u choose to marry üëç,btohqsg
But I mean  not In serious occasion la,btohqsg
Whut? Moonlight = cheat your way through life??,btohqsg
Like some small class test u never do work  than u just ask ur friend haha,btohqsg
Latter and former are only used when there are two variables hahaha here got three it doesnt make sense,btohqsg
Tell me if you got my meaning,btohqsg
For me moon light is a small issue,btohqsg
All the time haha  like all those not serious one  but serious occasion I know ah,btohqsg
I dk if uni or poly,btohqsg
If u can carry out ur operational duties efficiently  i dont see whats wrong with it,btohqsg
Like during PE  they ask us run,btohqsg
Than I always cut and take short cut,btohqsg
But chao keng is just fked up,btohqsg
I mean when I slack and cheat it doesn't affect anyone ah,btohqsg
It just my life more easy,btohqsg
Not like slack and make someone else do the work,btohqsg
But the same qualities can also manifest in the person hackcaring institutionally entrenched inefficient practices to come up with a more efficient process,btohqsg
Imagine if 13 trillion cells in ur body.. ur heart cells decided to slack,btohqsg
But we don‚Äôt understand the bf as a whole thru that conf to comment,btohqsg
I can't understand this   can u explain in simpler terms,btohqsg
13 trillion cells working for u until they die never take break always pushing themseleves regardless of heat or what,btohqsg
Like when I walk to sch  I always take the shortest path and lift cos i lazy walk the longer path  is that something wrong also,btohqsg
I‚Äôm extrapolating qualities from the situation  just like how OP and we are (ignoring abuse),btohqsg
Yea  maybe efficiency is a better word,btohqsg
I always do things the most efficient way to save my energy,btohqsg
Chao keng is diff  I understand,btohqsg
I never support those slacking that cause burden on others. Just those that make our life's a tiny bit easier,btohqsg
If we‚Äôre talking about ethics in the context of NS  I‚Äôm out. Not my place to comment.,btohqsg
Not he she they but it,btohqsg
*‚ÄùI‚Äù Here refers to ‚ÄúPlace Holder‚Äù,btohqsg
632 new cases today  9 local,btohqsg
Keep us on lockdown is good,btohqsg
bold of you to assume I'm not fat to begin with,btohqsg
How much money did that cost,btohqsg
I thinking of getting an iPad or Microsoft surface book in my uni   but the price is like $2000+ dollar,btohqsg
If anyone got second hand iPad and want to sell  let me know  I'll consider,btohqsg
I mean actually not wrong ah,btohqsg
