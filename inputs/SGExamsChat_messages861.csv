ü§£don't ask me engineering qns..I'm not a engineer to begin with,btohqsg
no theme - waste time and energy ü•¥,btohqsg
Well project no theme you may want to do a survey of sort,btohqsg
Like you must find a problem to solve right ?,btohqsg
Like eg. Why ppl prefer grab compared to ntuc cab?,btohqsg
Which is disconnected from culture thing,btohqsg
Actually this is a concern for many academic people,btohqsg
Language are loosing native speakers and some are reaching extinction,btohqsg
üòÑ i know you're learning Russian. That's why you're thinking about languages,btohqsg
üòÜ probably dialects seems along the line,btohqsg
I thought China do have this issue,btohqsg
Actually the dying dialects like Hakka..shanghainess,btohqsg
Manchu language in China is not popular and barely have anyone speaking them,btohqsg
aya simple lah just whack a app.,btohqsg
the tys of PW is always have been a app,btohqsg
thats why now got any issue right  gahmen just whack app,btohqsg
You mean a learning app for near extinct culture ?,btohqsg
sure.. conceptualize first  don't worry about the implementation.,btohqsg
anyhow draw on paper show your team mates. make more brains work,btohqsg
cmf got disagreements but it is better to have them right at the start,btohqsg
Jc rarely is about implementing   only if in Poly we have to worry about implementing,btohqsg
But the idea itself cannot be ridiculous ofc,btohqsg
ik PW no need implement  but somehow some people still worry and fixated on implementation.,btohqsg
but yeah  just run wild  not on yourself but with your mates,btohqsg
tbh everyone will settle on a app in the end lmao,btohqsg
Think need to prototype right ?,btohqsg
I not sure how jc pw work but in Poly we have to have a prototype first,btohqsg
Which can be done using mobile app prototyping tools,btohqsg
LOL how are they gonna have a cannon event :/,btohqsg
cca shld be fine  but outside school is btr,btohqsg
if they don't elab it's hard to know what they mean,btohqsg
but they mainly want to exclude your normal acad curriculum,btohqsg
talking about cca in a way that makes sense is better than pulling smth out from nowhere that doesn't,btohqsg
Sounds like a human right issue,btohqsg
My parents dun have much education so they allowed me to choose my own path myself which is Poly route .... I told them I want to be able to work in computer field after graduation so Poly is the only choice that is feasible for me,btohqsg
we have no rights  we have no say and we long to be free one day,btohqsg
üòî sg changee taste so horrible ..ranting here,btohqsg
It tasted so different from msia's taste üò™,btohqsg
changee is horrible to drink in the first place,btohqsg
If you're a tea person you will appreciate changee..cause it's quality tea.,btohqsg
queue not long if u find a empty chaggee,btohqsg
Shld I try the MY version?,btohqsg
You can go and try ..there's a vast difference,btohqsg
Please don't try sg's version. I thought it was the same thing..so I ordered the big cup üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg

Sg everything going downhill. Out is the way,btohqsg
ONLY THE LISAN AL GAIB CAN SAVE US,btohqsg
@kohsyanhow's the phy research culture in NTU,btohqsg

I ordered and it was nb only issue i had was I miss my pearls :(Actually never tried it in SG... or in MY its too ex liao,btohqsg
When I bought it it took like 5-10 mins?,btohqsg
Idk i didn't drink in MY or SG,btohqsg
I paid like 20 Yuan if I remembered correctly,btohqsg
Its damn ex comparatively especially with Mixue down the corner.Or down every corner I should say,btohqsg
how many times has this bot been banned,btohqsg
I guess the AI doing its job in combating spam bot,btohqsg
my parents told me to follow my heart and passion,btohqsg
so sad still got poly stigma after so many years,btohqsg
Poly and JC has no comparison basis,btohqsg
While the math learning may seem similar,btohqsg
They are built for completely different purposes and academic methods of studying,btohqsg
Good morningHas anyone went for the psychometric assessment exercise by the govt?,btohqsg
üòÇ SG MoH food & health restriction?It saves you from being diabetic.,btohqsg
It's not that ..sg changee shortchanged the taste of tea..not sugar level,btohqsg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lErGZZgUbY&t=139s&ab_channel=LinusTechTipsFramework 12 for USD$1000 for i3 convertible seems ok.,btohqsg
ship it to Singapore and it suddenly becomes 1.3k,btohqsg
then ship to Malaysia  dispose the box  and pass custom tax free. haha,btohqsg
Does it involve going to some institute at buona vista?,btohqsg
The institute i do know is at buangkok,btohqsg
I was gonna say I only know the one at buangkok green,btohqsg
Just go in saying you are looking for the president tharman,btohqsg
They give you your own private room,btohqsg
I do need another hall after this year,btohqsg
It's FOC as long as you don't ever go out,btohqsg
Psh you dont know the power i hold,btohqsg
But the location at Buangkok takes a while to get to NTU la,btohqsg
I dont need ntu anymore after this sem,btohqsg

Oh yeah you the dumbo the elephant that want to do intern on the last sem right,btohqsg

Mr money bags overhere with a Job,btohqsg
I aint no money bag but a begger,btohqsg
Psh you dont have the skills i do,btohqsg
Get on my level of broke,btohqsg
When youre that broke your begging is more genuine,btohqsg
You cant bribe if youre broke,btohqsg
Begging is just bribery without the capital,btohqsg
I dont rlly have very vivid memories of it but i rmb there were two computer components,btohqsg
One mostly testing on some kind of math and reading idk some mcq thingy. I think is about inference skills based on a short sentence/para,btohqsg
The next one involves a computer simulation game,btohqsg
With like about 12 rounds  with the 11th round involving the calculator,btohqsg
One tea shop similar like bbt just that ..it has no toppings like pearls,btohqsg

Heard of a famous lawyer who was a gangster   he runs a pro bono basis legal consultation of sorts,btohqsg
Josephus is his name if not wrong,btohqsg
Yea he and another drug addiction guy open law firm together,btohqsg

"i always feel their tea always bland""er"" side la. üòÇ only buy or meet up friends there just to spill tea session only.again my tongue is cursed from Mamak Tea-O iced already. üòÇ",btohqsg
basically milk  with subtle nodes of flavouring,btohqsg
üòÜ high sugar content you like,btohqsg
it's more like the norm sugar level  you typically would experience eating out alot in KL.,btohqsg
especially with our Mamak culture. The cheapest thing you can get a bag of Teh-O ice takeaway tied on the side.,btohqsg
I know..koi sesame milk tea is only entitled to KL!,btohqsg
No wonder...but kl is like high society. Fast car and bad jams,btohqsg
it took me 5 years+ to realized Koi is Ë±Ü Ôºàdou),btohqsg
anyhow  hardly drink sweet drinks over RM 5  only on special occassion or superb hot days lol,btohqsg
idk. bout that. high society  but the minimum wage is still RM 1.2k,btohqsg
No wonder my jb friend go kl work,btohqsg
any work that is WFH  without me leaving my house to join the Peak Hour jams or Public Transport. I'm quite happy for it.,btohqsg
She study law. Working in rhb bank,btohqsg

I would like to ask sth out of curiosity   as you all may know   sg prison system have allowed offenders students to enroll in a o and n levels courses,btohqsg
So apart from some gangster becoming lawyers  what other career opportunity do they have once releasedÔºü,btohqsg
Influencers / pastors / motivational speakers / yellow ribbon advocate and officer / business owners / employees of organisations that are less particular - also depends on nature of crime,btohqsg
Eg. Driving related crime - usually harder get driving jobs etc,btohqsg
The sky is the limit! Why ah,btohqsg
Is how you defend your stand to win,btohqsg
But then again  I doubt you want to go through the hassle of being a legal law assistant..because don't forget if you work small firm= you need to be the 3-4 lawyers hands and legsüòÖ,btohqsg
Which also means shortage of staffs in legal law..because it's not an easy job,btohqsg
It seems a lot of the Chinese web is locked behind the Chinese phone number barrier. Is it possible for us in Singapore to get a Chinese phone number?,btohqsg

Ahh well heard of gangster and offenders becoming lawyers after released from prison,btohqsg
They must have scored good rp for a levels to pull that off,btohqsg
I have been trying to work on a dedicated project to make a level stats materials,btohqsg
Imagine that it gets printed and sent to prison school students for a levels h2 Math course,btohqsg
Still budgeting btw   coz I need materials beyond my Poly stats knowledge even though the underlying math is the same   the a level is much more tricky to do,btohqsg
Yeah   most modern calculators can deal with standard form I think,btohqsg
I working in temp jobs that kind,btohqsg
In sg I have to use my funds to get needed books and tools,btohqsg

Youll never find another school that records every lecture  is fully airconditioned  has a canteen next to it and sofas for you to sleep,btohqsg
That much i can appreciate spms for,btohqsg
Since when Tampines got river one,btohqsg
This one is the old golden mile complex,btohqsg
help this is like my sixth time seeing this,btohqsg
How come telegram so many bots uh,btohqsg
not me chatgpt-ing my entire assignemnt too,btohqsg
tbf its a useless mod to me so i have no qualms chatgpting it,btohqsg
Like if it‚Äôs useful and applicable to working world we def will learn it lah,btohqsg
Tell me I'm calling you  GPT.,btohqsg
if no world tour this year imma be sad,btohqsg
They said there is a tour,btohqsg
Is just dk what destinations the tour is other than SK,btohqsg
yeah thats what i meant mb,btohqsg
i feel like there is a chance they might give sg a miss,btohqsg
they booked whole star theatre and only first floor is filled  like thats a bad impression ngl,btohqsg
I mean u the guy who goes to KL for them,btohqsg
i went there and went back on the same day,btohqsg
on a 6 hour bus each way,btohqsg
What if they went to Indonesia or Thailand,btohqsg

If you see Tom Hanks on any form of transportation,btohqsg

rllyyy i lowk regret nt going poly sia,btohqsg
ya it is. even the grade percentage is insane too,btohqsg
then is it like v competitive?,btohqsg
this is sp but np does not have d- so below 50% is a f,btohqsg
to enter uni  ppl need to score B and above cus the gpa fr most course is high,btohqsg
wait its actly harder than As,btohqsg
But even if they get gpa 3.5  it may also not be enough,btohqsg
A levels is more acedemic gearing to prep for uni  poly is more technical and hands on more towards industry and career,btohqsg
I find that most poly people who do well enough to get to uni will most likely continue to do well in uni,btohqsg
isit cause the structure is abt the same,btohqsg
u hv to make lots of connections in poly and uni,btohqsg
Yeah because at the end of the day its gpa,btohqsg
So poly people who make it to local uni already know how to stay consistent,btohqsg
They just have to do it for another 3-4 years in uni,btohqsg
That actually does work pretty well,btohqsg
My friend graduated with only 3.1  worked a few years  now he's back in ntu studying cs,btohqsg
part time or full time degree?,btohqsg
Can I ask where are the steps and instructions to register as an O level private candidate,btohqsg
Can..but it's better to register in a school because have bell curve ..you might have lesser chance of passing the subject,btohqsg
i thought all o level exams normally conducted in school (public / private) ?Just that your name registry is labelled at private candidate that's all?,btohqsg
Like eg. If u register as private u study on your own ..no tips or etc given u. Chances of you not doing well is higher,btohqsg
So ppl go to private school to do private o,btohqsg
there's no age limit you can be in secondary school?,btohqsg
Taking o level once in school only. If you can't pass. Cannot retain. You have to go and retake on your own,btohqsg
school gives you more guidance but the exam is the same,btohqsg
for private  you get assigned an exam center that's a sec school near your home,btohqsg
Alevel everyone has a common enemy of SEAB,btohqsg
Poly the common enemy is everyone around you,btohqsg
Bruhh..changee dahong pao is literally like still the best ..drinking r&b it tasted bruhhüò™ changee's quality leaves are still the better ones,btohqsg
BMTC Graduation Meal (From Facebook) üòç,btohqsg
Well another path is ite general education   they offer limited o level courses support but better than nothing üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Wondering if anyone DAE to common engineering in poly,btohqsg
Yeah..but then route is how you plan,btohqsg
Any1 taken the ilets test before? Is it easyü§£ The maths?,btohqsg
If you plan go ite..will delay ns time in sg,btohqsg
It's like an international placement test to go havard/Oxford..like toefl test,btohqsg
Need to clock 7 and above and above to be eligible,btohqsg
then why you talk about math when ielts is an english test,btohqsg
No no. It has maths insideüòÖ,btohqsg
People also askDo Singaporeans need to take IELTS?While this is true for some universities  Singaporean students may still be asked for an IELTS score if they do not meet the English Language Proficiency Requirements.,btohqsg
I saw shopee inside have maths..sample paper also,btohqsg
it‚Äôs literally just a test to make sure you can speak read and write english lol,btohqsg
the only math is that it‚Äôs a possible topic they speak to you about,btohqsg
it was created for people from non english speaking countries to show they can speak it,btohqsg
for us you can get a 7 very easily if your english is decent,btohqsg
once you register for the test and pay for it  they normally give you access to more practices,btohqsg

Tbh I seen ppl in sg taking ielts or toefl .... sg students been through the local education system typically can score really well in ielts or toefl test since we use English language extensively,btohqsg
ü§£ I took before the toefl test to apply for UK uni before. But score ain't that fantastic,btohqsg
i heard poly kids need to take certain english test in uni,btohqsg
Make up for lack of gpÔºü,btohqsg
If minimum no B4 for O level results,btohqsg
Cause i hesitated to go for uni..wasn't sure whether I come back can earn 5k+.. so I didn't go. I don't want come back become some motivational speaker like some of my school mates..lmao,btohqsg
I'm not saying it's not a good career..just that I don't find the time worthwhile and the $$ you spent there..,btohqsg
For me I had enough of studying,btohqsg
Lol so I decided to stop at Poly atm,btohqsg
Think you can work few yrs to decide what you want first or what course you interested,btohqsg
But don't take too long..because after that you might have more commitments..and you might not continue,btohqsg
Which also means by right you can earn..eg 1 yr you by right you can 40k.. but cause you can't make up your mind..your lose 40k++,btohqsg
And when you actually reach like 40's maybe.. you want to chiong also cannot..,btohqsg
Because you have too many commitments..,btohqsg
r/PCMR is going wild about the Radeon 9070 XT. What are the chances the value proposition of that card is still going to be as good at Singapore market pricing?,btohqsg
but i believe it would still be better than Nvidia's offering for this generation,btohqsg
Or China market  depending on if it hits China first before making its way to Singapore,btohqsg
I want to ask sth though  I heard China trying to reduce teenagers gaming hours,btohqsg
Wouldn't that kinda reduce demand on high end computers parts ?,btohqsg

It's already a law in China..sg also going to follow trend to control,btohqsg
Not really  that's more for multiplayer games. Singleplayer games are being promoted by the China government,btohqsg
If you haven't registered for singpass I advise you do it now to prevent issues with o levels registration. If you registered just wait I guess üò≥üòÖ,btohqsg

Bruhh..actually Mongolian girls also not bad.. just that they're abit wild,btohqsg
My friend found a Japanese wife but eh not gorgeous type.,btohqsg
Japan you can study for free in university..,btohqsg
If you want a different life compared to sg,btohqsg
But you got to think.. carefree without income = dangerous..no career advancement. U go japan still can find Japanese mei mei.. get a job..ppl envy uü§£,btohqsg
But i tell you first..later u go japan you might not want come back sg,btohqsg
I have half Japanese relatives haha,btohqsg
Japan is good but has a ton of natural disasters though,btohqsg
I won't disagree that Russian girls look very pretty like barbie dolls when they're youngü§£,btohqsg
Osaka has lesser disaster if you're comparing,btohqsg
bruh you said this last time when it‚Äôs not true,btohqsg
ü§£ but the courses offer is to help boost their economy,btohqsg
send the source then. i‚Äôm curious,btohqsg
I didn't apply for the courses. Cause I don't want go japan study..bruhhü§£ I'm not a technical person,btohqsg
My half Japanese relative quite okay in sg   her mom think send her for Japanese classes and pay her duolingo subscription üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
As for whether I can get gf even is up to destiny I guess.,btohqsg
I have a rough and rocky past experience with crushes so whether I can enter a relationship is a big unknown too.,btohqsg
You shld make a japanese notes and materials,btohqsg
Lol no interest in Japanese language but I will ask if that relative can or not uh üòÖ haha,btohqsg
My interests too exotic for most sg people,btohqsg
what are your interests may i ask,btohqsg
surely can't be more unique than mine right?,btohqsg
Language wise I have trial with Russian language on duolingo and going well,btohqsg
Animals wise I have interest in cats (big  medium  domestic or wild),btohqsg
I have strong attachment with IT and education industry matters,btohqsg
Strange hobby though   I write materials for fun,btohqsg
i once tried russian in duolingo,btohqsg
now i hv a 152 day streak in duolingo for japanese,btohqsg
which btw fun fact  if you use a russian VPN for duolingo  you get infinite hearts,btohqsg

i remember some guy went onto CNA news about showing his excessive hobby of keeping Buses,btohqsg
i mean some videos went viral about the new mrt station,btohqsg
to be forgotten the next dat,btohqsg
like literarily no one talking abt hume rn lol,btohqsg
only the chaos that ensued during the opening,btohqsg
got q  a few tht ik have a passion for bus,btohqsg
i‚Äôm sorry but there‚Äôs a limit for this sort of thing,btohqsg
ahh because no other free landmarks in Singapore?,btohqsg
at the end  it's just initial hype. see2 look2 new station what's new that's all.,btohqsg
I be more excited if there's a new mall. rather than a new station.,btohqsg
they just love to overhype absolutely new things for absolutely no reason,btohqsg
no point if it's still gna be there tmrw lol,btohqsg
But Russian don't say I didn't warn you ah..the girls may be very sexy/pretty..barbie..but may do drugs and etc,btohqsg
Nah I just realised I am over a certain weight and is probably planning to intermittent fast,btohqsg

Blessed Ramadan Month to everyone observing it!,btohqsg
Holy crap..I saw 5 cars üöó buang collision üí•,btohqsg
can someone tell me if these are stars,btohqsg
im tired of ppl telling me its satellites,btohqsg
If it is satellite   it obrits right Ôºü,btohqsg
nt too sure i js want to know what it is cos i've been trying to crack it for the past few days,btohqsg
Think satellites will move if not wrong yeah if I recall correctly,btohqsg
okay i'll take a look and see if they move,btohqsg
stars are just planets far away so,btohqsg
maybe they can be both :0,btohqsg
But then planets orbiting other stars can only by detected using sensitive instruments indirectly,btohqsg
Think if observe from earth the stars movement is negligible unless is like millions of years that kind,btohqsg
There are even military jets that use stars to navigate so,btohqsg
Antony didn't even have to play all Real Betis needed was his presence,btohqsg
Caption mentioning FC Barcelona is crazy,btohqsg
I was actually wondering sth .... how come there is no one attempting to manipulate sports competition for their own benefits?,btohqsg
A classic example will be ppl manipulating soccer match to win football bets... what's stopping them from doing so uh ?,btohqsg
But how to prove that a match is manipulated anyway ?,btohqsg
Release of deepseek is making many companies scrambling to self host.,btohqsg
Meaning higher purchase of GPU/CPU and ram,btohqsg
geostationary satellites wouldnt move tho right?,btohqsg
GEO is extremely far away  cannot see,btohqsg
That one need someone with better knowledge in orbital mechanics to explain üòÇüò≥üòÖ I dun do physics for too long,btohqsg
ISS so big already and is in LEO. Naked eye is one tiny dot in the sky,btohqsg
Technically they dont move from our perspective because they orbit at the same speed as earth's rotation,btohqsg
Bruhh..I just finish watching the new marvel movies...eek,btohqsg
Oh well  some ppl say satellite quite predictable somehow as they follow gravitational physics laws üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
There has been cases where satellite signals are disrupted by degradation either intentionally or otherwise,btohqsg
That why certain military invest loads money in developing spy planes   avoiding the probability signals from satellite gets jammed somehow,btohqsg
satellites unless very near cannot see from earth,btohqsg
like ISS v near and is barely bright enough to appear as a star,btohqsg
but even then v difficult to see with naked eye,btohqsg
geostationary satellites are so far need telescope to just see a small speck of it,btohqsg
Just download sky map on your phone should be Mars in there,btohqsg
This time if I come up with stats materials for a level use   I will have to do a test run first before it gets to reddit üòÇüòÇüòÇ coz my previous attempt of producing jc/Poly materials as one prove to be problematic,btohqsg
Wait how come gt Russian bots ? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
"Having Russian gf may be a strange experience though ...  I was learning Russian from native speaker online and managed to get the grammar behind ""—è –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ç–µ–±—è"" (which means ""I love you"" in Russian) üòÇüòÇüëç",btohqsg
ü§£ and I will tell u privet,btohqsg

H2 Mathematics - Use of Graphing Calculator TI84.pdf,btohqsg
people now use TI84 Plus CE,btohqsg
Yea I feel like this focuses on probability and stats portions  which is good,btohqsg
Esp the simultaneous eqns finder and roots of a solution finder,btohqsg
Trying to rewrite stats materials with support for gc operations,btohqsg
If good I hope it ends up on holy grail somehow,btohqsg
Instructions quite similar I think ... I fired up a Web emulator,btohqsg
For ti84 plus CE edition   nothing changed with regards to 2nd key and vars to get to the distribution functionality,btohqsg
