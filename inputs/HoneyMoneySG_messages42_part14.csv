HSBC Revolution DealSuccessful Application before 1 May  2359 HHSBC Revolutionhttps://hmsg.link/hsbcrevolution,btohqsg
Hi guys I have both Google pay and simplygo installed on my phone.When I use my phone to tap for mrt/bus.  How do I differentiate whether it's using Google pay or simplygo ya? üôè,btohqsg
simplygo is just for u to check your transport transactions. To use googlepay for mrt/bus  either set googlepay as the default nfc payment app or activate googlepay as the active nfc app,btohqsg
I have been reading about XNAP and LiquidPay. Saw the hawker stall  they normally have one of the icon.If I download XNAP and pay by CC  can I also used that to pay for those stall that show LiquidPay?,btohqsg
For HSBC revolution calendar month calculation of bonus points  is it based on transaction date?I.e. transacted on 30th April but payment is still pending. Would the eventual transaction fall in April or may?,btohqsg
I see...Meaning we can use googlepay for mrt/bus is entitled for the *6% cashback if use Standard Chartered Smart* ?Because I noticed the terms from Standard Chaartered  it stated Bus/mrt via simplygo,btohqsg
Read through what exactly is simplygohttps://www.simplygo.com.sg/,btohqsg
posted date. so transaction posted in may count to may,btohqsg
Yes. XNAP app either use Apple Pay or Google Pay to settle payment. The credit card(s) you are using need to be in the e-wallet of the above. If you have more than one card in the e-wallet  you can choose from list of credit card(s) in the e-wallet to pay.,btohqsg
"Card or gpay will get 6%  both will show ""Bus/mrt"". Trial and tested. Doesn't matter if u add to simplygo or not",btohqsg
https://t.me/kelvinvestIs this the legit channel? When I do a telegram search  3 channel of similar names shows up.,btohqsg
Thanks Bro. But what about LiquidPay  do I need to download the apps also for LiquidPay? Or can use XNAP to pay the stall with LiquidPay accepted? TIA üòä,btohqsg
Welcome  Kelvin. Sorry I can't provide a direct ans to your question. If I see the 'multiple lines of logos' SGQR  I would use my XNAP app to scan. So far it works for me :),btohqsg
It‚Äôs okay. I downloaded the 2 Apps üòä,btohqsg
In what cases will posted and transaction date differ?,btohqsg
In all cases it would differ :). Transaction date and posted day differ typically differ between 1 - 3 days. Personally  I take the median (2 days).,btohqsg
So if I make a transaction today  the transaction will be posted in May? Will the e-statement reflect 30 April or May?,btohqsg
"Hi all  like to check if anyone knows for DBS WWMC "". The additional 9X DBS Pointsor 7X DBS Points are only applicable for the first S$2 000 online spend per calendar month"". If my bill is from 16th of the current month to 15th of May  then my $2000 will only reset on 16th May? =(EDIT: Called DBS to verify. They said 1st of the month to end of the month. It doesn't follow statement date.",btohqsg
It will reflect transaction date in Apr  posting date in May. The key point is that hsbc revolution rewards go by calendar month of posted transaction  so will apply for May.,btohqsg
Okay thanks everyone for clarifying üôè,btohqsg
Agree. Now is 6.10 pm. Tomorrow is public holiday. Most likely the posting date would be 2nd May.,btohqsg
Your answer was in your question: calendar month üòÅ,btohqsg
Am new  have a few silly questions to ask.1. Does UOB One's interest rate compound monthly?2. If I have $30 000 in my UOB One account and only qualify for the first interest bracket  will I receive the next bracket's interest rate for the amount past $30 000 next month?3. How does the 7.65% interest rate for the $25 000 past $75 000 apply to UOB One's maximum 5% per annum interest rate for $100 000?Cause from the website‚Äôs calculator  it seems like the max we can get is the fixed $5000 per annum and 0.05% on remaining.Also just curious if this form of calculation is similar for other savings accounts. (The way per annum works  to me seems like simple interest per year divided by 12 months),btohqsg
Hi all have a question about DBS WWMC linked to Krispay transaction.Does anyone know if DBS WWMC used to make Krispay payments is counted as ‚Äúonline payments‚Äù and under the 4 mod earn rate?,btohqsg
Anyone received cashback from Revolut Mar transport promotion?,btohqsg
Max 5K pa for 100K balance SI not CI,btohqsg
Hi All  What do you think is the best credit card to buy an expensive air ticket priced at 1.4k  *while maximising rewards/cashback,btohqsg
Hi  think you have to add some background to your question such as what platform are you buying (e.g. Expedia  Chan Brothers office  Airline website) =),btohqsg
I will either go with Expedia or Qatar Airways,btohqsg
Which date did u received it? I have yet to receive it till date,btohqsg
Revolut promo requires u have transport spend in many days of the month.Problem is if u use MasterCard version it lumps a few days into 1. Causes problems.U need to use visa if u want spend posted daily.,btohqsg
For cashback  use either uob one or scb Manhattan for the proposed $1.4K spend size.,btohqsg
That could explain. I only had 9 transactions for the month T.T,btohqsg
Usually holidays or sundays some apps will conduct maintenance. Best not to keep trying if first time already kenna error.,btohqsg
Personally  I would use HSBC Revolution Credit Card to get 2.5% cashback unless Expedia and Qatar Airways give promo for specific cards.,btohqsg
HSBC rev is capped at $1000/month for the 4Mile/$ mean i will miss out  on the remaining $400,btohqsg
You need to do comparison between few websites n consider what credit card you have.UOB lady can get 6mpd up to $1k if you are on right category). Max $1k.DBS Altitude(8 mpd thru Expedia special link  it may be more expensive  pls compare)DBS altitude 3mpd max $5kHSBC 4mpd up to max $1k onlyDBS WWMC 4mpd up to $2k.,btohqsg
If you have SC credit cards  check SC website if the promotion up to 10% for Qatar airways worth or not compare to other credit card rewards.https://www.sc.com/sg/promotions/the-good-life-privileges/#731500-sg,btohqsg
Citibank also has up to 10% discount but promo ends today at 1159pm.https://www.citiworldprivileges.com/sg-singapore/online/up_to_10_off-341082,btohqsg
Anyone used DBS balance transfer feature? They're running a promo currently and I'm considering using it for my reno. From what I understand:DBS Green Renovation Loan$30000 loaned amountInsurance and handling fee are 1% each  taken from disbursed funds  $29400 paid to ID Firm.Monthly installment: $2 563.83  so $30 765.96 paid for $29400Total $1 365.96 paid in fees+ interest (30765.96-29400)DBS Balance TransferUse $29400 loan amount to compare4.5% fee = $1323  added to 'total amount loaned' for calculation of monthly repaymentsInterest freeMonthly installment for first 11 months: $768.075 (2.5% monthly payments using cashline)Last month: $22 274.175So main difference is if I choose DBS Balance Transfer Much better cashflow for first 11 months but no insurance on the loanAny opinions on this?,btohqsg
Anyone has the OCBC NXT card? How's the card?,btohqsg
Hi guys. What‚Äôs the procedure to enter the flash deal rewards at singsaver.It‚Äôs mentioned the first 10 application from 12pm till 9pm for the mentioned days.So one must enter the email at sing saver and then quickly complete all at 12pm ? Has anyone here gotten Singsaver rewards ?,btohqsg
For the hsbc ega  can I apply the account and qualify for the step up promo. So my reference month April will be zero cos I don‚Äôt have account. And then I need increase adb for the next 3 months ? Is that it ?,btohqsg
Let the mad rush to transfer EGA funds begin! Careful not to transfer to the wrong account! üòÇ,btohqsg
wahhh all start already ahh so on,btohqsg
Dont forget the 5 x fast transfer out task. üòç,btohqsg
i also curious will it work?,btohqsg
Ok it's due to ipaymy being excluded now. Take note ppl,btohqsg
Really? I just got my rebate 28th Apr.,btohqsg
But my Spree received only partial rebate last month as they changed a payment processor and it was no longer tagged online .... True that ipaymy is not that stable recently  so I switched some payments to cardup.,btohqsg
