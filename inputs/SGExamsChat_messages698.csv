actually i think during my time tsd only offered to arts stream,btohqsg
my class hasBCMeBCMgBcMELLBcMHBCMGBCMCLLBCmHBCmCLLtheres a h2 geog slot on my timetable but idk who takes h2 geog,btohqsg
SUNLIGHT üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
My batch got 4? Ppl from sci stream,btohqsg
how does the timetabling com settle timetable which such mix classes,btohqsg
Her a lvl tsd n art paper,btohqsg
i prefer the old system where most classes are fixed subj combination,btohqsg
Dunno she need to settle w her CT sia,btohqsg
But it's literally not her fault,btohqsg
maybe it is a rare combi,btohqsg
wait wait  h2 chem no longer comp ah,btohqsg
S5 also got some ppl take H2 Phys only,btohqsg
wait how to take both P and B,btohqsg
no there are like rules regarding h2 chem and math,btohqsg
P and B tgt only acjc offer iirc,btohqsg
oh H2 chem used to be compulsory in sci stream,btohqsg
seem like they had dropped it,btohqsg
The H2 maths rule isn't even a thing now,btohqsg
ik quite a few bio h1 maths,btohqsg
for mine i dun think any sci class took H1 math,btohqsg
Some of those are the people who want to do bio but failed ip maths,btohqsg
but i heard h1 math can score 100,btohqsg
They don't even have trigo differentiation,btohqsg
the top in h1 math for my batch was 100m,btohqsg
i think the only subject that u can reach 100 lol,btohqsg
Yea so they just do BCm lol,btohqsg
cause like really cannot take h2 maths,btohqsg
but then again h2 math not required for med so like,btohqsg
yea if you sure udw h2 math courses then go ahead,btohqsg
med only need h2 chem and h2 phys/bio,btohqsg
tbh for h1 sci (math included)  it is much much easier than their h2 version,btohqsg
while i heard h1 and h2 geog not that much difference,btohqsg
for med is H2 Chem + H2 Bio/Phy,btohqsg
same goes for econs in terms of content (coz tm use same notes for both h1 and h2 so we h2 peeps know what the h1 dun cover and it aint that big difference),btohqsg
I only know h1 and h2 hist h1 doesnt have sea hist at all,btohqsg
which is why josh kept asking me to take h1 hist,btohqsg
i feel for arts the difference lies more in terms of the format (H2 econs is 1 30m CSQ + 3 25m esay; H1 is 2 CSQs),btohqsg
i remembered at the start of j2  my econs cher came to me and say 'i think u will do better in H1',btohqsg
Cuz right we also try H2 drq,btohqsg
Doesn't feel that diff from h1,btohqsg
it's becoming a dating/relationship advice sub reddit,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
drq is it data response qns,btohqsg
but i dun get why arts subject dun hv prereq unlike sci,btohqsg
haven't heard of that phrase in such a long time,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
how do people who dun take geog / hist in sec sch do them in as,btohqsg
Jump from no geog to H1 geog ok,btohqsg
Jump from no geog to h2 geog kinda insane,btohqsg
Ik someone who did this in my batch tho,btohqsg
my cousin didnt take lit in sec school coz no offer  then jc came to take h2 + h3 lit,btohqsg
If U force the geog + hist combi kids from sec sch,btohqsg
yea lit not much content  but rather on technique,btohqsg
I feel like sci is like,btohqsg
They use some o lvl shit,btohqsg
but 6 books in 2y is crazy,btohqsg
That's y got the pre req,btohqsg
i cant even handle 1 book in 2y,btohqsg
But ofc I only can speak for my subj la,btohqsg
ofc not brobut i wld expect it to like vary from the different posts i see from that subredditBUT NOPE3 POSTS AND THEY ALL ARE THE SAME TOPIC,btohqsg
The only thing semi useful from o lvl geog to H1 is,btohqsg
tbh i should hv taken geog as my elect,btohqsg
But the skills I learnt from,btohqsg
Kinda carried over to A lvl,btohqsg
it is easier to jump grades and do miracle than lit,btohqsg
It's why I decided fuck lit in lower sec,btohqsg
i came across a post that more sec sch should offer econs at sec sch...but then as someone who took econs in sec and H2 econs in jc  i can say content wise much easier to understand but the answering technique is different,btohqsg
Ways to test also and all,btohqsg
Tbh the main jump for geog for me was essay tho,btohqsg
The way essay done at Os damn diff from As,btohqsg
does content overlap between os and as,btohqsg
cause i think the answering technique is diff,btohqsg
New sylla I think will have more overlap,btohqsg
tbh for history the jump is mostly in terms of the answering skills not content  at least for paper 1,btohqsg
ah ic  just curious why doing the subj in Os is not a pre-req unlike sciences,btohqsg
chem no question coz chem is compulsory in Os,btohqsg
I heard some schs got phys bio one,btohqsg
i tot it was compulsory all this while:-(,btohqsg
I mean tbh theres a reason why sch want u to take chem,btohqsg
Because alot of poly course and h2 chem need O level chem,btohqsg
But afaik  is not compulsory like english is,btohqsg
omg all these while i thought chem was compulsory,btohqsg
but i mean i would hv taken chem regardless,btohqsg
I mean it kinda is for the absolute majority of people la,btohqsg
i nearly took combine sci chem / phy but my school didnt offer,btohqsg
but tbh it is a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
coz i would have died doing phy at As,btohqsg
I wanted bio and hist so bad,btohqsg
I suck thumb and take geog,btohqsg
Then end up I love geog alot now,btohqsg
THIS IS ACTUALLY RACISM AT IT'S FINEST,btohqsg
tbh i would have scored higher for l1r5 if econs did not exist in my school,btohqsg
coz i was doing pretty bad for all 3 humans in sec 2,btohqsg
so took gamble and try econs lmao,btohqsg
wtf o level econs? so rare lol,btohqsg
the downside to it is that combine humans becomes ur compulsory added humans,btohqsg
and i was equally bad in ss + lit lmao,btohqsg
then my mum was like 'see u never listen  i ask u take geog',btohqsg
Wait so they have an advantage in H2 econs?,btohqsg
Content wise yes they understand btr,btohqsg
and since its inception  it has not expanded,btohqsg
- my friend who take H2 econs from o lvl econs,btohqsg
yes coz the o level econs right  not much analysis needed  like it is more of regurgitating the content,btohqsg
So concept taught in O level econs is somewhat transferable to H2 econs?,btohqsg
Meanwhile I consider o lvl geog borderline useless,btohqsg
there is overlap but expanded much more,btohqsg
for essay  each qns split into 2 4 6 8m and it is mainly content,btohqsg
o level econs got mcq lol,btohqsg
so not easy to score as well under time constraints,btohqsg
my class alr got 3 people took o lvl econs,btohqsg
i dunno coincidence or what coz i know o lvl econs is rare,btohqsg
maybe temasek sec has a big econs cohort  idk,btohqsg
‚ÄúEconomics at TMS is also one of the most sought-after subjects at Upper Secondary level‚Äù,btohqsg
interesting  on the flip side my school's econs cohort is 18-2(drop) = 16,btohqsg
nowadays resources are so abundant that even if you need to spend more time figuring out alternative ways to learn (when the teachers are shit)  it's very doable. by the time uni comes  it's straight up not enough to just rely on lecturers and their notes if they want a complete understanding,btohqsg
even in jc it's not enough  but you just had to know how to score for the exam,btohqsg
absolutely true  i think i asked my friend more chem and math questions than i ask my tutors,btohqsg
and even now there are more resources  agreed,btohqsg
but it just takes greater amount of effort ah,btohqsg
than having a readily accessible good tutor,btohqsg
good lecturers in uni is absolutely rare (maybe moe should create nie training for uni lecturers lmao),btohqsg
i think ur investment part is wrong,btohqsg
i heard is because many lecturers are there to do research so their focus not to teach,btohqsg
WHY IS MY KEYBOARD TYPING NOOOOOO ALL OF A SUDDEN,btohqsg
yes  teaching is part of their job but typically not why they apply for it,btohqsg
it's bc unis can provide a ton of funding for their research,btohqsg
but there exists positions that are more teaching focused,btohqsg
it is change in inventories right,btohqsg
meanwhile from ay 24/25  nus will stop reimbursing dyom course certifications,btohqsg
yes. you are keeping 60 pairs of rubber soles that are neither used or sold,btohqsg
oh i got it  idk what i was doing previously lmao,btohqsg
i actually wonder who will be willing to pay $200+ for DYOM certification coz my WTP = $0,btohqsg
the benefit is just free CSCU and otot (but nus modules are embedded in ur school fees liao),btohqsg
it is free but to get the certificate  it is $200+,btohqsg
u need the official verified certification,btohqsg
they didnt explain their rationale behind scraping the reimbursement,btohqsg
but i mean can guess guess ah haha,btohqsg
ite is full of retarded ppl,btohqsg
wld u like to also explain y is there a fking 39 y/o inside,btohqsg
I thought ite is for life long learning,btohqsg
no this person oso make alot of weird comments. i had to delete that,btohqsg
i texted him to stop it alr,btohqsg
i texted him to ask him to stop hitting on minors,btohqsg
im to lazy to dig the chat,btohqsg
i was looking through the chat,btohqsg
and trying to direct the attention towards u instead,btohqsg
js uk tryna ask to stop',btohqsg
I actually didnt do anything. Lmao,btohqsg
Hes just behaving like a twat. No idea what hes tryna achieve,btohqsg
I wasnt even talking to him.,btohqsg
And moreover. Whats a hwa chong student doing here. Sus. Bro. He isnt even alumni,btohqsg
Wait calista i wanna try smth,btohqsg
Actl should i mess with the guy,btohqsg
What is a gss doing in a chat group full of minors,btohqsg
There are other things u cld do besides wasting ur time on him,btohqsg
this is sgexams so by that logic we should ban all the working adults right,btohqsg
Unless uw him to waste time,btohqsg
Im js taking a break rn,btohqsg
Cant be bothered  rather talk to yall,btohqsg
lol u want ban jun wei isit?,btohqsg
We dh ppl like him here,btohqsg
how bout this  u pm him instead. i legit dk how to reply him,btohqsg
him: ooh chiobus!! Lets see who i can hit up on,btohqsg
Rand ang started this whole thing bro,btohqsg
Heck. I didnt even hit on anyone,btohqsg
Tryna flirt with the 17 y/o,btohqsg
Wait i go see the chat,btohqsg
by that same logic  eating too much maggi will cause cancer right,btohqsg
Then he will be Mothership and jail worthy,btohqsg
Thats the same as me talking to u,btohqsg
Dont get on my bad side like rand ang ya,btohqsg
I didnt tag her since that,btohqsg
So rand accuses me of garbage. And u leap to his defense?,btohqsg
Me tagging charmz means i hitting on her?,btohqsg
U do know whats hitting on someone right?,btohqsg
even sge discord  got someone hit on minors dekita instant ban,btohqsg
last time in sge someone said he wanted to r/pe me,btohqsg
no giving 2nd chance or what not,btohqsg
Imo its good to be neutral if you're not the one in power but if you are then cannot be neutral alr,btohqsg
was he ever active in this chat,btohqsg
Rand in what cases will u consider neutral as a valid stance,btohqsg
technically most of the tea is here,btohqsg
Is this the same YI obsessed guy?,btohqsg
There was a guy who went around telling people ‚ÄúYI best‚Äù  like spamming it,btohqsg
u/Ill-Juggernaut-8382 this the reddit yi guy,btohqsg
Lol how do you remember the username,btohqsg
its not difficult to rmb lol,btohqsg
Rly meh. 45 mins is more than enough,btohqsg
Can finish in less than half the time,btohqsg
Some of the qns just need like 20 seconds,btohqsg
I remember him last time mf kept replying to my messages with the same thing,btohqsg
Maybe tmjc is close to one of the schs that has o level Econs?,btohqsg
My class only had one other person,btohqsg
shld be either temasek sec or tkgs,btohqsg
I js search up sth iw to find out then type reddit next to it on google,btohqsg
I barely am on social media nowadays,btohqsg
Omg same I think it‚Äôs a bad habit tho?,btohqsg
Cuz I don‚Äôt even read articles / websites anymore,btohqsg
I always get peoples opinions on Reddit when googling a problem,btohqsg
i still read cna if it interests me,btohqsg
we should also ban the already graduated mods,btohqsg
I meant this  it‚Äôs not always ideal to get opinions from Reddit since it‚Äôs a social media platform too,btohqsg
i meannn it is an informal setting u can js write like anything and its very heavily opinionated,btohqsg
size is kinda vague so i wouldn't recommend that,btohqsg
blud i literally spent 5 years understanding cells,btohqsg
Exactly  and the voting system is also kinda rigged tbh,btohqsg
prokaryotes don't have membrane bound organelles except 70S ribosomes,btohqsg
Like when I was using it I‚Äôd downvote a post if I saw that it had many downvotes  pretty sure I‚Äôm not the only one,btohqsg
bro it's so weird downvoting a comment with so many upvotes,btohqsg
although he might be factually wrong,btohqsg
Exactly that‚Äôs why I say it‚Äôs rigged,btohqsg
some schools teach the formulas diff,btohqsg
not east as in some qns can be tricky --> carelessness lol,btohqsg
last time i touched bio was 13 years ago,btohqsg
ya  i saw a comment mentioning p*rn but got so many upvotes,btohqsg
before last year when i read my mentee's notes,btohqsg
but have time to score well,btohqsg
i think i scored close to full marks,btohqsg
the other 2 people were from temasek (ok la it is near),btohqsg
and looks like tms has bigger cohort than my school (16 people),btohqsg
everytime the weekend comes  rsge instantly turns from sane to horny,btohqsg
yeah all these kids writing out fantasies,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt go on there anymore,btohqsg
there was one post about a guy's crush kissing the guy and holding hands but that mf still has the balls to ask if SHE LIKES HIM,btohqsg
tempted to fake a relationship story in sge,btohqsg
tkgs econs cohort is extremely small (in the 10s) lol...majority of the people in tm with econs background is from temasek,btohqsg
ohhh. my fren took econs in tkgs and she now in vjc,btohqsg
which is easier to farm karma?A. A very interesting and intellectual science project with at least 1000 hours of research with a well-thought out and detailed thought process  which could potentially help to save the world in the futureB. WHY IS MY OGL SO HOT??????,btohqsg
yes tkgian ends up in vj  tj or tm,btohqsg
hmm. i rmbr last time we used to joke tht if she ends up in tm she can js dash across the road and she'll rch alr,btohqsg
but she to smart for tm,btohqsg
heard of a friend who went to ac,btohqsg
i know of 6 pointers going tm becoz of distance,btohqsg
im saying majority of tkgians choose these 3 schools,btohqsg
honestly im surprised that there's people from RANDOM NEIGHBOURHOOD SCHOOLS which i never knew of  but can go to top tier jcs,btohqsg
sch does not define the results,btohqsg
u can succeed in any school if u put in the effort,btohqsg
thank you i will be the first yijc-ian to get 70rp!,btohqsg
i remembered the first sentence the principal said to us was 'there are students from 93 secondary schools',btohqsg
1/100000 chance but it's worth the odds,btohqsg
Actually I would say there are yijcians who alr got 70 rp so you arent the first >:),btohqsg
isnt vj super far for her,btohqsg
ohya and also since she got straight A's. she shld go ri instead,btohqsg
i mean her pri and sec s h also quite far,btohqsg
i hv a friend who could go ny (near her house) but then choose to come tm for her friend sake,btohqsg
I have a friend who won watermelon eating contest,btohqsg
Yeah there‚Äôs usually around 2-3 qns not very clear. That‚Äôs why most of the time when I practice past year mcq papers I get 27-29 instead of 30. But some papers I managed to get 30 before,btohqsg
But for real most can be done under 30 secs,btohqsg
Not really  just be consistent over the 2 years and you‚Äôre good,btohqsg
pri sch im bedok sec sch dunman lane,btohqsg
sec sch ofc people choose school of their cop caliber  but then jc  people then to choose taking into acct distance more (coz of longer sch hours and a lvl rigour),btohqsg
and also there are only that few jcs and some are really no go in terms of distance,btohqsg
My sch got someone from acs bru,btohqsg
in tmjc got quite some ppl from sec schs in the west,btohqsg
reasons why sgexams is slowly converting into sgteens,btohqsg
also got a girl from choa chu kang sec,btohqsg
and bpghs and nan hua and juying and bukit batok and acsi and so on,btohqsg
ur sch oso got ppl frm my sec sch,btohqsg
but tbh i think there will be fewer 6 pointers that go to JP and YI base on distance,btohqsg
sgexams mods only permitting r/s posts on weekends  knowing well that people will be more desperate to post during the weekends and the sub will be flooded with dirty minded people:,btohqsg
actually thinking about it  somehow my whole class is east-ne-central sec schools,btohqsg
my class has one guy from fuhua and one guy from juying,btohqsg
Actl tjc closest jc to my house,btohqsg
omg that is all the way in jurong,btohqsg
sge before 06-07' people invaded the sub was better,btohqsg
3 of us  in class living in the west ish area,btohqsg
one of them stay in victoria hall,btohqsg
eh wait is jp in jurong or pioneer,btohqsg
my ct say his ex student live in pasir ris went to river valley ip6 years of 2h journey,btohqsg
very shocking that JURONG PIONEER jc is in neither jurong or pioneer,btohqsg
my class got ppl frm west side. even tho theres ite west,btohqsg
i meant is it in the campus of jjc or pjc,btohqsg
somone frm my sec sch went ite west,btohqsg
moving to jjc in a few years tho,btohqsg
tm is a sure mj campus coz mj is est 2003,btohqsg
04s are still okay la  even the r/s posts were lesser and had more logic,btohqsg
they revamping all the merge jc campuses,btohqsg
moving back to ajc campus once rebuilding complete,btohqsg
i wonder if it will shift back,btohqsg
now people only know how to post fake and unrealistic r/s posts just for clout,btohqsg
ik wat other sub is dead? r/ite,btohqsg
yijc will also move to IJC campus when they renovate it,btohqsg
nope certainly not + tpjc campus is holding tjc now and mjc campus is very new,btohqsg
i read somewhere will have upgrading only by 2030+,btohqsg
on my travel to tmjc i will pass by the ijc campus,btohqsg
Bruh i thought i was gonna do work today but i didnt ü§°,btohqsg
coz mjc is given birth in 2003 so it is still very new,btohqsg
no the campus only getting more moldy and dusty,btohqsg
if yijc = yjc+ijc and jpjc = jjc and pjc  does that mean sajc= sjc + ajc??? and isn't ajc the former anderson junior college? and isn't ajc = asrjc?? SO IT MEANS SAJC = ASR????,btohqsg
161/168 is the single reason why woodlands ppl even go to tmjc,btohqsg
maybe coz ijc dun bother to keep their campus new,btohqsg
i lived in woodlands last time  but it was lowk boring cos it was still isolated in the 2000s,btohqsg
i think they're seeking to rebuild ASRJC campus to look like EJC,btohqsg
then u change where? at ikea ah,btohqsg
the aft punggol road bus stop,btohqsg
the expressway is the reason my journey is reasonable,btohqsg
why asr got no direct mrt tho,btohqsg
ew. i hat 89&3 fking crowded,btohqsg
SR campus has a bus from serangoon  AJC campus has a mrt outside,btohqsg
guys. thoughts on bus 14 at 5pm on a Saturday,btohqsg
Wait if cannot qualify for local uni where they go,btohqsg
there is a freaking new bus with just 5 stops.......,btohqsg
Yea then cannot go zen me ban,btohqsg
some people cannot get into med in singapore go overseas,btohqsg
53 straight from my hse but the 53 bus timing is erratic,btohqsg
once i saw next bus only arrives in 20+mins,btohqsg
bus 14 when it finally has consistent timings:,btohqsg
sometimes it can be freaking 10min behind schedule,btohqsg
"so from then i only take the ""Tampines Meridian JC"" bus stop",btohqsg
bro one bus is like 1.15pm and the next one is like 1.45pm,btohqsg
some bus stop opposite tmjc main gate,btohqsg
the bus stop with name tmjc is at the side gate,btohqsg
the one opp park view primary,btohqsg
meanwhile i recently applied for a job and the merged schools are not listed in the dropdown,btohqsg
i had to specify by clicking others (though i was tempted to put as Meridian lmao),btohqsg
gothere.sgstill says tampines jc and meridian jc,btohqsg
my mom ended up going to temasek jc instead of tmjc for parent teacher engagement session bc the website give her directions to the TPJC campus,btohqsg
oh tht bus stop oni got 3 and 68,btohqsg
then she blindly went in or she,btohqsg
when she saw the main gate immediately she call my dad,btohqsg
meanwhile i purposely not let my parents know about ptc coz my gp cher became my form cher,btohqsg
i dun want drama part 2,btohqsg
then by the time she arrive at tmjc ms pang alr halfway thru her speech,btohqsg
is it cheating to act gay with the homies?for context  i'm a guy who recently starting dating another guybefore i met my current boyfriend  i already had homies who i'd be sus with. we'd flirt  pretend to almost kiss  touch each other up  etc. (but no homo ofc  its all platonic)it feels weird to stop doing it now  but continuing it feels disrespectful to the sancitity of my relationship with my bf. but also he seems chill with it  so idkplease offer your input on this ethical dilemma,btohqsg
it is better than having a drama then my chem cher hate me even more,btohqsg
coz my cts were my chem and gp cher...so ya,btohqsg
i dun want to lose temper again lmao,btohqsg
coz my dad nagging at me nonstop about gp,btohqsg
my dad keeps nagging me about a levels bro,btohqsg
later i kena sent to counselling,btohqsg
so my dad borrowed some fm book from 1990s to give me,btohqsg
it's the 07 batch what do you expect,btohqsg
why have ur subject combi got to do w ur results,btohqsg
like its the thought that counts,btohqsg
actually people saying people in hybrid dun do well coz stats show it  but i think it doesnt make sense to link any subj combi with results since it is chosen by us and ya it doesnt make sense...,btohqsg
07 batch is the start of skibidi toilet + thinks touching girls are okay,btohqsg
previously he already insisting he buy assesment books for me,btohqsg
"then telling me ""MUST GET ALL THE As""",btohqsg
me is the other way round,btohqsg
he ask my sis that when she comes back can tutor me even tho we take diff subject combis,btohqsg
i ask my dad get for me lol,btohqsg
i tell my dad i take H1 econs he make me read H2 econs notes anyways,btohqsg
this is so ironic to my parents,btohqsg
my dad ask me why not econs,btohqsg
my parents never nagged at me after psle,btohqsg
Principals: - Ms Yeo Hong Mui (2005‚Äì2009) - Mrs Marian Chia (2010‚Äì2012) - Mr Michael de Silva (2013‚Äì2018),btohqsg
my mom did even more afyer psle ü§°ü§°ü§°üíÄ,btohqsg
tbh h1 and h2 are largely similar in content,btohqsg
after i screwd up psle  my parents think lowly of me already,btohqsg
From the videos I saw about her she seems quite good,btohqsg
i swear my parents secretly wanted me to go poly,btohqsg
I didnt top the cohort for psle  my mom was sadge,btohqsg
um in cricket if the ball passes the boundary of a particular playing field  if there is 0 bounce between being hit by the bat and crossing the boundary  it is 6 runs  the most u can score in a single delivery(throw of a ball). However if there was at least a single bounce  regardless of the number of bounces  it is 4 runs,btohqsg
my parents are the type of people who will ask why i only passed pw instead of getting an A,btohqsg
I was looking into the history of merged jcs a while back,btohqsg
u will see stuff like tm is the worst,btohqsg
someone told me it came on reddit but i think it was deleted??,btohqsg
I thought at least mjc had a good first principal,btohqsg
back in pri sch i thought acjc was a top tier jc,btohqsg
parents are the type of people who ask why i only got A for GP when I could have gotten A*,btohqsg
When it was founded in 2003,btohqsg
but the principal that took over was TP's principal,btohqsg
the way my dad describe JC sounds like one of those china gaokao study camps,btohqsg
Oh u mean the history of the parent colleges,btohqsg
which jc actually has a good principal,btohqsg
me next sun realising i have not touched my work,btohqsg
he openly told the cohort something like he keeps an eye of the top scorers by marking their names on his list or sth like that,btohqsg
mjc vs tjc principal rap battle?,btohqsg
The thing is i could do most of these in 1 day but I usually procrastinate,btohqsg
Last time i would finish holiday hw in the week it was given,btohqsg

i can also do it in 1(0) day,btohqsg

ur pfp says hello. Im js responding to the greeting,btohqsg

And then i sleep late and go to school telling ppl im so tired,btohqsg
i sleep late only to black out during pe,btohqsg
sometimes i sleep till 11pm then rmb i haven't finish my tutorials :D,btohqsg
at least you think about your tutorials...,btohqsg
i don't think i finished any tutorial after term 1 week 2 of jc,btohqsg
i fainted during beep test once,btohqsg
but by the time i arrive home will be like 6-7pm,btohqsg
i think right last time we at most have 1-2 days ending really late is coz almost every class has a fixed timetable,btohqsg
but now seem like most classes are mixed,btohqsg
I fell asleep also while on the floor when i gained consciousness,btohqsg
on friday mr lim was very shocked to learn that we are dismissed on 1/1.30pm that day,btohqsg
then he joke he gonna feedback to the timetabling commitee,btohqsg
it's ok i never really finished in uni either,btohqsg
he also say that in J2 the 4H2 ppl's timetable gonna be damn screwed,btohqsg
i remembered mr lim only talks math things to us,btohqsg
he one of our 2 fm tutors,btohqsg
weird coz mr lim like always very serious one,btohqsg
was 3 but one of them i think gonna be gone for a long time,btohqsg
he was mad at me before tho...coz when i was called during lecture  i only raised my hand i think 1-2min after when lecturer be like 'dun worry it is not u',btohqsg
then during tutorial he keep side eyeing me and dun talk to me at all lol,btohqsg
coz i was a shy kid in jc,btohqsg
actually i have not grown out of the shy bubble,btohqsg
during orientation i talked like 10 words a day,btohqsg
in uni there is something called free loaders  so in a team of 5  only 2-3 people are contributing to tutorials:-(,btohqsg
then when i got my cg something just clicked between me and my classmates,btohqsg
tbh this  it is not coz i dw answer  it is coz i shy raise up my hand lmao coz i was literally in the middle aisle and eye level of the lecturer,btohqsg
and LT4 is so big with 600+ people,btohqsg
i only talked a lot to people i alr got close to,btohqsg
idk how but my cliques already formed since ori,btohqsg
i mean for me i make it a point to never be a burden to others so if it's a graded thing i'll get it done. if anything i'm the one carrying others...i just don't finish tutorials when it's not part of my grade,btohqsg
after orientation there is only one guy i wave to whenever i see him,btohqsg
the rest all have their own lives alr,btohqsg
i had orientation in my cg so it is easier i guess,btohqsg
my first cce lesson with our cg talk abit with the ppl sitting around me,btohqsg
they were quite fast in releasing classes,btohqsg
then up until now i haven't talked to them again,btohqsg
i hope u made friends at least,btohqsg
tbh that's alr my biggest worry gone,btohqsg
for me i struggle to be the first person who speaks...so it is other people who speaks to me first,btohqsg
then i feel bad when we all just sitting there not talking to each other,btohqsg
yea i can feel the awkward silence,btohqsg
but we had free seating tho in the classrm,btohqsg
usually i will sit with my closest friend,btohqsg
i remembered in math lecture  one person from my class had to sit my himself/herself at another row with another class coz 1 table broke lol,btohqsg
i sit at same spot throughout the 2y,btohqsg
but now j1 still no homeroom right,btohqsg
IM AT SEMBAWANG WHARVES YET I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE WAVE OF WATER üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
then when it's fm before physics lecture all the chem ppl alr in their seats while we have to walk and find our class,btohqsg
that is the downside of mix subject combinationh,btohqsg
also need to guide the autistic girl there in case she gets lost,btohqsg
my brother is actually very good in direction,btohqsg
i dunno why and from when they mixed subject combination,btohqsg
same i thought fm used to be 4H2 only,btohqsg
i tot u mentioned it has something to do with the new system,btohqsg
yeah i heard cld be because of that,btohqsg
tbh not sure if i would do well if i had taken fm,btohqsg
very funny last time the only fm combi tmjc offer is CFMx,btohqsg
oh i was referring to the mix subj combi classes,btohqsg
maybe it was introduced by the new principal,btohqsg
oh yeah our cg is the only one other than s210 to have geog in our timetable,btohqsg
bc 2 students taking pfmg and the fm students all allocated to one class specifically,btohqsg
the s210 class is the contrasting subject that is not econs,btohqsg
then our class is the exception\,btohqsg
s1 shld all be PCME/PFME only,btohqsg
i really now think that perhaps birth rates are really decreasing that they have to merge the schools,btohqsg
s2 all but our class and s210 the timetable has contrasting subject other than econs,btohqsg
My batch 210 is PCMe only,btohqsg
i think usually the last class for s2 and s3 series is where all the ppl taking hist/geog/lit go,btohqsg
im not sure about 2020 batch...but my batch hasA101  A201-202  A301-303  S101  S201-212  S301-310  S401-404  S411-415  S501-502,btohqsg
S4 is only 1 H2 sci,btohqsg
How y'all know so much about other classes,btohqsg
all the people i know take standard PCMe or BCMe lmao,btohqsg
ok the BCEm ppl go S308,btohqsg
I literally can rat on abt how the class r organised off top of my head,btohqsg
Ngl i regret taking h1 econs,btohqsg
Then my ogl friends R like,btohqsg
i still dk how the arts classes are assigned,btohqsg
but i know S211-2 is PCEg/h  S210 was mix PCMe + PCMx,btohqsg
I assume some is got h2 maths and others dont?,btohqsg
A101 p sure is 4H2s but their timetable also got H1 econs and whatnot,btohqsg
Got another arts stream class also got H2 maths,btohqsg
I can't rmb which one tho,btohqsg
Some is seperated by h2 art,btohqsg
i only know A301 was LHEm,btohqsg
i think the arts H1 math ppl go the A3 series,btohqsg
My batch have like 10 ppl take I think,btohqsg
And got 3? In sci stream,btohqsg
Ngl i kinda wanna do tsd but jc dont have :(,btohqsg
But ya I'm only familiar w how sci stream works,btohqsg
got people in A101 took the chinese studies in english i think,btohqsg
