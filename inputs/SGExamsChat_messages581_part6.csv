My point is stuff like that isnâ€™t going to grant you true happiness  donâ€™t wanna get too philosophical  theyâ€™re just temporary pleasures to help you cope with life  at least thatâ€™s how I see it,btohqsg
How long does it take for a sec 2 to get used to sec 3 life style LOL,btohqsg
cos Iw ask that easy way out guy again,btohqsg
But itll take too much effort,btohqsg
People who think there is such thing as true happiness would find it very hard to be happy,btohqsg
because at the back of their head they will be thinking if what im experiencing in the moment even happiness,btohqsg
u can find true happiness from simple pleasures in life,btohqsg
Noo cos u rmb that guy who asked for easiest  subj combi,btohqsg
Yep true  you just go where the path leads you  do what you like and stuff,btohqsg
