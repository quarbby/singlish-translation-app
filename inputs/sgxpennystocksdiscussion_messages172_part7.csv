Finally close 35.... Heee more action liao,btohqsg

Shared this on 28th Aug 2020 back then. But guess it was not ripe then when BBs block $0.010But now  different story since micropennies time is now. I believe BBs will not block and let it run together,btohqsg
Scanned through some micro pennies and one counter looks quite promising for BBs to make nice pump playHGH Holdings (Formerly AA Holdings)- BBs have track record for playing this up really big.- plenty of accumulation seemed to have been done. Looks like they waiting to pump.- 1 Year Low : 0.006  1 year high : 0.012- Pennies in season and BBs might see incentive to break 1 year high 0.012 to force the break out play.- 18 900 lots changed hands mainly at $0.010 on 26/8/2020. Hence  do watch for this contra T+3/T+4 flushing where BBs try to collect cheaper from contra hands.- if buy  need to hold. So play within your means.- Safe entry would be ideally to Q $0.009 and below. But if $0.010 gonna break  can try to enter here.Good luck. DYODD. Hope this one can be a home run.,btohqsg

Bro Dax  what Tp are you looking at? Thanks,btohqsg
btw bro@MysticDaxHS optimus u looking at wat Tp,btohqsg
Today volume was quite unexpected. Never expected it to open 0.008 too. I was still hoping to get 0.006 filled.Good thing is we got BBs attention on this one. Over 100 million volume . Highest in the last 4 years I believe.Should have more to come.I am already holding in bag . I hope can sell $0.010 above.But have to see sentiments. If Oceanus start crash üí•   then need to be nimble and decide fast.,btohqsg
The year high is $0.012 . If we Q and buy $0.010 to during tomorrow opening. We will see whether the BBs block or not. If no block  then will test $0.012 and could easily break. The key is really $0.010.Last time round when we bought there was inside sellers blocking. But this time round   different as micro pennies are in play. Good timings,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing bro. Will support!,btohqsg
Sky is the limit üëΩüëΩüëΩhopefully this time for real,btohqsg
