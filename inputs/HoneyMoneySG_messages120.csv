I received my UOB Lady card in May but never received the bonus UNI$... just now the CSO told me that no bonus category was selected 😱 I remember I've selected the categories when I applied to the card.,btohqsg
Just to share... we might want to check to make sure. How do you check which category has been selected?,btohqsg
There is UOB chat assist. It's weird no category selected. I remember it's part of the form. Maybe can try appealing to uob.,btohqsg
Erm Melvyn  the second yuu card if under same pax should be auto link if it is a amex/visa 2 card scenario,btohqsg
The CSO helped me to appeal  they will contact me in 5~7 days.,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming.. so I remember correctly 😅 it's part of the form,btohqsg
Cuz he asked for linking of another card  I would assume he meant another name 😅,btohqsg
anyone know how the CB is credited? offset bill / points / cash into account,btohqsg
Should be credit to the cc card like any other cashback cc,btohqsg
Hi all! Would like to check for online purchase in foreign currency  is it better to pay using uob visa signature or amaze + crmc/ uob ladies  assuming MCC met and no issue with min/max spent. Am aware amaze need to be within $1k SGD  and uob vs fcy need to be above $1k,btohqsg
Using with amaze lowers the cost slightly  so I’ll go with amaze+crmc/lady’s first.,btohqsg
Wait  amaze $1k limit before fees is for local spend  not foreign currencyAmaze is 2% fee for your cards mpd (probably 4)Visa signature is 3.25% fee for 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I thot amaze will convert foreign currency to sgd  so need to be within $1k sgd. So no need?,btohqsg
No need  cap applies to domestic spend only. But you are limited by CRMC’s 1k cap for 4mpd,btohqsg
Okok! So I can spend within $2k for amaze + uob ladies solitare for my selected category,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know how long for this card to get approved by the bank?,btohqsg
Scb esaver is higher and bank is safer. So…..,btohqsg
Btw don't use other people photo as profile....not sure why u want to pretend others......,btohqsg
Anyway don't think anyone stupid enough think I am a cat right. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ya The blue cat on YouTube,btohqsg
I always thought you were a cat,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA  if 2nd month no increment and balance lesser than 1st month  the MAB interest will base only 0.05% or 3.6%?,btohqsg
3.6% assuming u sms register for bonus interest in 1st month,btohqsg
I think the 3.6% promo lasts two months  increment from reference month MAB.But the bonus 1% from everyday rewards not eligible cause based on previous month.,btohqsg
I register on 29th May  when open the new AC  bank in fund on June.So I need to register again for July? Because I move some fund out for Uob but intend put some recess fund  in EGA.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know what is UOB one acct   interest for month June (with 150K deposit)? Thanks,btohqsg
Regarding UOB one  the bonus earnmarked interest  has it been consistently every quarter like this time July  Aug Sep referencing to June and the next one will be Oct Nov Dec referencing to Sep?,btohqsg
I join may-june  then July to join again (without increment  will clear my AC to zero on aug)  maybe Sept or Oct join again.,btohqsg
So if I have two UOB accounts it will work very well,btohqsg
And i have 150k spare cash for each,btohqsg
If i participate the max bonus  the interest works out to be 5.75% pa for that 5 month right?,btohqsg
I remembered the earmark was not so long before,btohqsg
This new one 5 months  previously was 4 months,btohqsg
But the bonus was the same at $1100?,btohqsg
1000 for 4 months is much more worth is than 1100 for 5,btohqsg
So basically i will just join one of the account for this roundThe other one will empty it for the month of Sep,btohqsg
Any idea When will they announce the promo usually?,btohqsg
So next one they will announce only on 1st Oct?,btohqsg
Most likely  based on past data points.,btohqsg
Wa… meaning they kind of dont even give time for people to prepare unless you have been following their promo all the time,btohqsg
Anyone work out before if it is worth to empty out a month to give up that one month 4% pa interest and then take part in the promo vs consistently just park 150k in the One account,btohqsg
Can always rotate to hsbc ega during empty out month,btohqsg
HSBC better of SC eSaver better,btohqsg
What i know if SC eSaver might be 1% lower than HSBC but they pay right after the month end,btohqsg
see if you want to endure more pain for the 1% more loh..i find it worth it.Every $360k x 1% = $300 more of interest per month,btohqsg
They only give one month but you are right la,btohqsg
As of now  i dont think any short term investments can beat all these high interest accounts,btohqsg
exactly.. so must take the max pain and make the max hay while it lasts..who knows.. another 1 year more.. u want to do also no more liao.,btohqsg
Have to add the word * low risk,btohqsg
Definitely… high interest cant be forever,btohqsg
what agents or others may try to scare you (they may be right though)if you don't invest your cash.. only play this short term stuff  when savings accounts party ends  you want to invest  everything already fly upso it would be good to be diversified.. don't all eggs in one asset type,btohqsg
Is it true that i can just use my other account and just paynow with description ‘Salary’ to UOB and i will be eligible for the salary category?,btohqsg
It is not in the description. You have to choose salary payment in the drop down box,btohqsg
For new holders  just need to spend $1000 instead of $600 consecutively for 3 motnths.Is it $1000 for the entire quarter calendar  or must be within a particular calendar month?,btohqsg
hi allTo buy klook voucher via heymax (MCC 5311)  we can use HSBC live+Anyone knows about shopback klook MCC? I have searched and there are7299/5811  anyone has recent experience?Wanna see if I can use HSBC live + to buy shopback klook voucher,btohqsg
Ocbc drop down box dont have salary option,btohqsg
I referring from using DBS app perspective. So someone else can advise?,btohqsg
Using DBS Fast transfer for example,btohqsg
Shopback Vouchers is 7299. Just checked my Instarem app for a transaction in late June,btohqsg
Shopback nowadays keep coming back as 7299,btohqsg
GXS 3.48% for 3 months lol,btohqsg
I suggest not using mcc sensitive card with shopback vouchers,btohqsg
it's like FD.. cannot take out right?,btohqsg
I don't have this in my GXS app.,btohqsg
tiagong will change to 7299 upon posting,btohqsg
Ocbc does not have salary in the dropdown menu,btohqsg
Cardup + Citi Cards for Car Loans not working. Intended?,btohqsg
yes  not all cards are accepted yet😅,btohqsg
Anyone remember which is the credit card that lets you have 0% interest (free) overdraft for a small amount?,btohqsg
Feel a bit cheated. Because Citi cards is listed in their calculator site:https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
i went to see... can't find the details listed.i remember one of the cards boasted something like:First $xk of usage can be rolled over without any interest or fee  and it didn't even have to be a retail transaction.,btohqsg
but i think exclusion for card up car installments,btohqsg

I’ve got a couple of big purchases coming up  eg furniture and laptops  are there any specific card bonuses you guys would recommend me to look into to maximize value?,btohqsg
Usually will need multiple cards to maximise value,btohqsg
Check if can use hsbc live+,btohqsg
I am really scared to sell  naked puts.Is implementing put credit spreads a better way? I am still blur how to do it.,btohqsg
Hey guys  I saw that toastbox gift card is available onheymax.aiHow does the toastbox gift card come to me after purchasing it on heymax? Is it a physical voucher...? (I'm guessing no because heymax says 'This voucher may be used for multiple transactions in denominations of SGD0.01 until it runs out or expires.')Appreciate it if anyone who knows/has tried it before could share  thank you!,btohqsg
it will show up under 'View my voucher'  then you can click in to redeem. it will bring you to external browser and a QR code will appear. when you pay  scan the QR code and the amount will be deducted from the gift card.,btohqsg
I have a $2.8K air tickets to purchase  what are the best credit card to purchase?,btohqsg
The miles go straight to KF account?,btohqsg
Haha  like that put Syfe guaranteed like better.,btohqsg
GXS got flexibility to take out syfe doesn’t. Just that you go back to 2.68,btohqsg
syfe is way longer than 3 months right?,btohqsg
oh must have seen wrongly... thank you,btohqsg
syfe guaranteed is the one with no fees?,btohqsg
Regarding UOB One quarterly CC rebate  does 5 transactions to the same merchant on the same day works? Example $400 x 5 times every month.,btohqsg
nothing mention in the T&C about this… i guess no one tried it before?,btohqsg
I am really scared to sell  naked puts.Is implementing put credit spreads a better way? I am still blur how to do it.,btohqsg
u know why nobody is replying u right?1. nobody knows how2. you sound like a scammer luring responses,btohqsg
Does anyone know what’s the difference between zipair value and premium? I am concern whether value includes carry on.,btohqsg
Currently Shell is having promo for getting 25% discount if top up vPower and using citibank card to pay. The question is  if I am using the amaze card (pair with Citibank) to pay  will it register as I am using a citibank card to pay and get the 25% discount?,btohqsg
Haven't taken it personally. From the website baggage allowance  it said value will have 7kg carryon. And premium will pump it up to 15kg carryon.,btohqsg
Ok thanks! So its either I want the miles or I want the 25% discount,btohqsg
25 discount is definitely more then 4mpd,btohqsg
you know the 25% is assuming you use Citi Cashback card at 8% rebate hor,btohqsg

Hi  does Cardup spending using OCBC 90N count towards OCBC 360 account interest?,btohqsg
App dont have i only saw this in my email,btohqsg
Ok? Now what do I do with this info hmm,btohqsg
I would think yes. Ocbc 90n doesnt exclude cardup spend.,btohqsg
Oh. Thanks. I din know that. Couldnt find under fast transfer when wanted to transfer to 360 account,btohqsg
Why mention OCBC? OP said UOB.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust curious this scenario a hospital deducted from medisave let’s say 2k then can I top up as I know it a mistake from them as they will refund it back to cpf later will I still be able to get tax rebate from the amount I topped up.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what is the MCC at Ten+ Bistro in Singapore? I know UOB lady dining bonus category does not cover bars,btohqsg
SC said no withdraw and redeposit.  However I did but still get interest.  Wondering how they calculate  whether base on monthly average.,btohqsg
Hello can I check  for privimiles UOB card  thru the UOB Agoda link  we can enjoy up to 6mpd if we book thru it. Can I check if there is a cap to it?And also if anyone knows  is the website more expansive than normal Agoda website?Or  is there any thing I need to take note of?,btohqsg
As long as fresh funds . You can withdraw from your account to another bank and redeposit back into SC and that is considered fresh funds,btohqsg
Scb officially has the same 30 days fresh fund exclusion that we now see in HSBC and Uob. But as we all know it has never been enforced strictly (just don’t stupid and move from scb A to Scb B and expect it to be fresh funds). Use this data and make your own judgement on how HSBC and Uob might deal with it too.,btohqsg
just ignore that clause - have not been withdrawn and re-deposited within the last 30 days,btohqsg
This kind of words very dangerous to say in a public chat with 16k members.If tonight scb change logic programming u how?Just say your personal experience and state disclaimer safer,btohqsg
I move in 200k each time and never failed,btohqsg
my RM also assured me before. SC CSO also confirmed with me that this method will be considered fresh funds,btohqsg
Otherwise i really wont be so confident ,btohqsg
Should not make a difference. You still managed to top up  hence will be eligible for the tax relief. The refund will be refunded back to CPF  and if MA already at BHS  it will flow to SA.,btohqsg
If tonight they do maintenance and change it to match the t&c  your dp will be providing false info. With your assurance.,btohqsg
any other banks i will still have doubts  but for SC this will not happen..from my personal experience  HSBC  OCBC  UOB  RHB also don’t enforce this rule,btohqsg
Of course everything will have a ‘if’,btohqsg
This ‘if’ is currently used as a argumentative tool.,btohqsg
Chill la u guys. By this logic  all DPs are meaningless.,btohqsg
Sorry if i sound like i am arguingI saw a question that pops out and it is something i am super familiar with so i share…,btohqsg
Can advise what is the time at which bank draws money for GIRO deduction? Used to see HSBC deduction at around 4pm usually. I missed keeping money in the account  remembered around 6pm and transferred. Not seen any deduction till now,btohqsg
U need to move money in before the giro deduction.,btohqsg
"It's not about the logic. It's about ""assuring"" others against something different from t&c. Like what Mt said  share your personal experience  don't need to ""assure"" anything.",btohqsg
Do you know what time in the day is the deduction? Didn’t get any sms or notification of attempt to deduct,btohqsg
Around 4pmDid u have enough money in the account?,btohqsg
Now yes. Didn’t have at 4pm,btohqsg
"No one is saying your dp is invalid or wrong. It might be working differently from what t&c states now  but if the bank changed the system to follow the t&c and someone else takes your ""assurance"" for it  are you going to ""assure"" them their missing bonus interest?",btohqsg
Follow the t&c then… no need to ask this group,btohqsg
This group is to share what we experience before isnt it?,btohqsg
It's the same as UOB's salary crediting  everyone knows it works even with FAST from DBS. But no one here is assuring it works  all are just providing dp that it still works. Until one day someone provides a different dp of a different experience.,btohqsg
"Sharing your experience can come without your ""assurance"".",btohqsg
I think it’s more like you can give your data point without the assurance. (Saying that it confirm plus chop work) . Then it’s up to the individuals whether they want to “risk” it.,btohqsg
Like there’s a lot saying elsewhere that they don’t get their salary bonus for ocbc even after self crediting. So if people were to assure them it works  and they don’t get it  who takes “responsibility “,btohqsg
Suggest set standing instructions/recurring transfers. Usually will auto transfer in the morning  and will be able to catch the GIRO deduction timing.But people will always recommend not to be a JIT warrior  and just transfer one business day before.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGdo u know in what form is the $300 evouchers? E.g. is it wogi gift card?,btohqsg
"Just to be clear:- Providing datapoint (DP) is good  so that we know what works and what doesn't- Providing assurance is another thing altogether that even I won't put myself in this situation to avoid legal/regulatory issuesLastly  banks are always revising/""enhancing T&Cs"" to their own favour. It's always better to be more conservative in most cases of t&cs",btohqsg
Sounds very flexible if can use to redeem eCapitaVoucher or Grab or even others,btohqsg
Vouchers include eCapitaLand  Food Panda  Sephora  Grab Food  Grab Ride etc  and can beselected through SingSaver’s voucher redemption partner. Voucher types are subject toavailabilityDoesn't specifically mentioned Wogi,btohqsg
Dear sifus  HSBC Revolution Visa card can still earn 4 mpd from Anytime Fitness auto debit after July 15th?,btohqsg
Just providing dp that it was done successfully by another person is good enough. We shouldn’t provide assurance or even guarantee that it will work. It gives others a false of security. Like others said  there is nothing to stop banks from tightening their controls. And we definitely don’t want to take responsibility of otherwise happens especially if it involves money.  Are we willing to pay their loss if they can’t get the interest cos of what we said?,btohqsg
Yeah just first time have such scenario not too sure . Thanks,btohqsg
Wait for 30 days is the best.. maybe bonus interest will still be in by waiting lor,btohqsg
Yup. If it works  good  share your dp. If it doesn't  sad  but still share your dp.No need to give any assurances  the reminders here are not because your dp is wrong  they are here to prevent getting into any legal issues.,btohqsg
I wonder what kind of legal issues will anyway get into from my assurance…I just said it.. wait for 30 days… follow the T&C … what do you get? Most probably nothing..* please do not start to use new scenarios like the funds can still be used in other banks to argue because the questions was about SC policy on fresh funds and redepositing after withdrawal < 30 daysOrTry what i saidWhat is the issue with you against my words?Yes i said i assure and guarantee this method will work…. I dont see anything wrong with what I said..You are nitpicking on my words for what?The only thing you are doing now is to make me stop sharing what I know and i have learnt from my banking experience so far.. simple as that,btohqsg
Day 1 of my participation in this channel turns and you are just trying to say I am a busybody,btohqsg
You are the busybody trying to find different ways and extreme scenarios which is actually very unnecessary,btohqsg
Why are u so angst when a couple of us are trying to be nice to u.Nobody is saying bad things about u….,btohqsg
Is it worth it to sign up for UOB savings promo with UOB stash account? Am thinking either 100k or 150k… although seems like 100k is the right choice if its for stash account,btohqsg
For Stash  sweet spot for the deposit promo would be $100k  which gives about 4.68% p.a. for a 5 months lockup. Whether that's worthwhile or not depends on your personal circumstances.,btohqsg
This is taking into account annualizing the $700 earmark reward + 3% on 100k bal i assume?,btohqsg
Appreciate it. Thanks for breaking it down,btohqsg
Hello! My giro has been approved and linked to uob acct. Does anyone knw if I still need to terminate and apply for new payment plan on IRAS directly? Abit confused as IRAS site only stated to apply via PIB for uob.,btohqsg
Do not terminate your GIRO payment plan if you are intending to use CardUp. When setting up the payment  CardUp will go through step by step. Do not skip any steps.,btohqsg
Sorry wasnt clear! My payment plan on IRAS shows OCBC (my previous arrangement). Now that UOB GIRO has been approved and showing up on UOB TMRW app  do I still need to go to IRAS site and terminate my existing OCBC arrangement + add new giro arrangement for UOB?Or wld it be automatically terminated and set up with UOB since it has been approved on uob's end?,btohqsg
It will override your old GIRO payment plan. It shouldn't matter what bank is there if you intend to pay with CardUp anyway.,btohqsg
OH ok. Im so noob. Got it. Means i can go set up my card up arrangement alr. Wee thanks!,btohqsg
Hi  I'm looking at getting aircon from Audio House during their 7.7 promo. I have Kris+ app  CitiReward card and Insteram Amaze. However I'm not sure how to link these all tgt.To pay with Kris+ I need Google Pay  and at Google Pay do I add the Amaze card?So after all these  I simply pay with Kris+ that is linked to GooglePay > Insteram > CitiReward? 😅 Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all if I use Kris+ Google pay using HSBC revolution is it considered online ?,btohqsg
Yes considered online but have to make sure it's in the whitelist for revolution,btohqsg
Hi  for hsbc live+ credit card  anyone know what is the mcc for shopee/lazada? want to check if laptop purchases on shopee/lazada will qualify for the 8% cashback,btohqsg
I'm just curious  are we qualified if it's kris+ > Google pay > (skip instaram) > citi rewards  since kris+ should be online right,btohqsg
Citi is weird... they deemed almost every google pay payments as non-online payment... So need amaze to convert it to online.,btohqsg
Depending on the product u buy. The mcc might differs  but generically its:Lazada: 5311Shopee: 5699Do check the mcc code after purchasing using app like heymax and if the mcc is excluded  do an immediate refund.,btohqsg
Hi. Can anyone advise on how to use credit card on hawker QR code? Used to do XNAP and Activesg. But both methods were being removed.,btohqsg

Morning all  I am trying to unfreeze my ichange card but unable to unfreeze. Any1 face similar issue? Or manage to unfreeze?,btohqsg
Is not weird. The t&c specifically state excluding mobile wallet transactions.,btohqsg
Well  evol treat google pay (non-contactless) as online payments i dun see why they cant do it.,btohqsg
Maybe you should read the t&cs.CRMC does not treat GPay as offline  butBLACKLISTSmobile wallets from bonus rewards. Same for ApplePay.UOB EVOL does not.,btohqsg
Ya  going to do tat. See if any folks face similar n have a method to unlock. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi can i check  is this the msg that indicated im enrolled in the EGA latest July promotion? The thing is i didnt send any sms to sign up  im using A and B account and this month im using B account  and this sms is for A account (but im using A account for Giro payment and did the 2000 deposit  plus 5 transaction)  so does this means im enrolled in the promotion regardless?,btohqsg
The first sentence have told you what you're qualified for. You have done 2k deposit and 5 transactions.,btohqsg
Ok so means i cannot sign up this account for any Aug new EGA promotion correct? The plan for me was to sign up in aug only cos i need to switch back to this in Aug as i just move out funds in end June.,btohqsg
Did you register for Jul? T&c specifically states you cannot join Aug if you have registered in Jul.,btohqsg
I didnt register (did not send sms)   so this msg alert is jz telling me im entitled to the 1% cash back for giro? Abit confusing haha,btohqsg
Has anyone received HSBC bonus interest that meant to pay by 30 June?,btohqsg
Great morning everyone  what is the best card to link or top up Grab wallet?,btohqsg
Thanks for the speedy reply 🤑,btohqsg
Lol I don’t have this… Any other,btohqsg
People gotta let grab go 🥹,btohqsg
I mean some places only accept PayNow QR and GrabPay QR.. 0.3% better than nothing.And +1% also.,btohqsg
Thats true. I was trying to replace with amex pay but that app is buggy. Success rate 80-90%,btohqsg
HSBC EGA has 3 components:1. Base interest 0.05%2. Everyday+ rewards. 1% bonus interest on incremental month on month and 1% giro/card spend= transfer in $xk + 5 eligible transactions. No need to register.3. Bonus interest of 3.x% on incremental against reference month.= need to send SMS to register. If already in a registered period (2 months these days) u cannot register for another period.,btohqsg

Hi  can I get some advice. I have an OCBC 360 account. am thinking which card to get to fulfill the $500 spend which this card would be for mainly transport(like bus and mrt maybe grab?) and could include ‘other expenses’ like food/ online shopping. I have crmc +amaze which usually covers my ‘other expenses’ but transport alone would not be $500/month for me which is also why I didn’t consider the uob ladies and I am not travelling anytime soon.,btohqsg
Or u can keep refer other to cardup  get the referral reward to offset the fee haha,btohqsg
Look at OCBC 365 if you can hit $800 minRefer to video:https://youtu.be/jJSYE4lPIGM?si=AdrSTCYPXUs9C2rw,btohqsg
if u cant hit 800  can try for infinity card  at least get 1.6% on the 500 spend,btohqsg
For stash account  if I deposit on 31st July  do I get any interest for that day?,btohqsg
Yes if your mab is higher then jun,btohqsg
OK  this is for the national saver promo  just wan to deposit on last day,btohqsg
Assuming you put in 100k  your MAB for July is 3225$ and you will get interest for that amount  which is 0.05%.,btohqsg
Cause stash need July mab to be higher than jun.. I find this very grey.. So if my only day which is 31st July in stash is higher than jun mab  is that OK.. Else how I 1 day meet entire month mab,btohqsg
can anybody advise which credit card is best for retail spending?,btohqsg
UOB nation saver is about fresh fund. You can still qualify for that. Just the usual UOB stash interest is very little due to low MAB.,btohqsg
you will get paid stash interest on that incremental MAB loh..let's say1st July = $1000 until 30th July31st July = +$150k.. balance is $151kYour July MAB = APPROX $150k / 31 = $4xxxThen you get bonus interest on $4xxx - June MAB loh x stash bonus rate,btohqsg
I won't recommend pump in last day or last few days...1. system recognition error2. you earn low interest on those last few daysBest is pump in on day 1. You earn the maximum interest on both the Bonus Interest as well as Earmark Promo.Hence I deem the National Saving Promo as 5.5 months lockin.,btohqsg
Yes  Uob acct rewards high interest for the last 25k/30k so better to pump in earlier in the month.,btohqsg
Got it  what is confusing is June I have 0$. 101k in may then the website show 101k for mab..so shld be 0 instead.. Thanks folks,btohqsg
u check early issit? uob haven't updated the MAB figure for June.. check again now?,btohqsg
i would argue you want to play the national savings promo.. you should maximise for the entire period.. otherwise you are locking in 5.5 months for a lower EIR..,btohqsg
As in u'll count starting from 1 Jul?,btohqsg
Yes  I check on 2nd July.. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi. Does UOB privi miles card able to get 1.4 mpd for MCC 7311 advertising services?,btohqsg
As long as mcc is not in exclusion list u will get 1.4 mpd  u can always ask cso in uob chat assist to cross check for u,btohqsg
Thanks! Didn’t know there’s a UOB chat assist. Appreciate your reply,btohqsg
If that's the case then the realistic lock in is 6 months  since it makes more sense to keep the funds until end Dec given that u are locked in until 17 Dec,btohqsg
Actually as long as for month of jul u park in a higher yielding bank it is fine to transfer in last day of jul,btohqsg
yes true.. also right... 6 months then!,btohqsg
also can but you become JIT warrior loh..any earlier (say 1 day earlier) you earn peanut interest for the month,btohqsg
Yea that's what I did the last round  though Mt's point is it's probably easier and safer to just do it 1 Jul,btohqsg
since the competitor is HSBC 4.6%  vs UOB One 4%.... i would rather very much just dump into UOB One on Day 1 and keep until end of Month 6.,btohqsg
For uob one yes  but op is originally asking about stash,btohqsg
just saying ah.... hope i don't black mouth...31st july 6pm u want to transfer into UOB One liao..then HSBC kenna network down or system maintenance how?,btohqsg
More of UOB 6%. any amount missing between 125k and 150k is losing 6% in UOB one acct,btohqsg
Morning all  may I ask if HSBC Revolution Visa card can still earn 4 mpd from Anytime Fitness auto debit after July 15th?,btohqsg
hmm this line of thought... maybe a bit too early on saturday for my brain to follow.. but i 'sort of' get it but i don't think it is 6%,btohqsg
It's the tiered ADB  so the portion of ADB above $125k and up to $150k earns 6%. The EIR of the entire $150k works out to 4% (3% on first $75k  4.5% on next $50k  6% on last $25k).,btohqsg
Hello all  since xnap is down. Can Singaporeans use alipay to pay as an alternative to xnap at hawkers with SGQR?,btohqsg
but you are putting say $150k for 1 day on 31st July... do you really lose 6% p.a. on that one day?,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm if this way earn miles?,btohqsg
This way don't earn miles of we can't pay with alipay?,btohqsg
U cant use alipay as singaporean in singapore,btohqsg
U can only use alipay on china merchant using card,btohqsg
too chiem for me.. i rather keep it kiasu kiasi and easy..Day 1 put in.End of Month 6 take outWhole 6 months don't touch the Original + Earmark amount.(Bonus interest i will withdraw out  but keep $100 buffer at all times).No need to worry don't get earmark  get caught by any TNC  any clawback.,btohqsg
That's fine. End of the day just go with whatever works lah  be it 5.47% p.a. for 6 months or 5.76% for 5 months. For most people it's probably not worthwhile to min max that much.,btohqsg
thanks for correcting me 5.5 months is incorrect. Since have to keep until end of the month on last month.so 5.6% p.a. EIR won't be realised. It is 5.47% p.a.WORKINGS1100 / 150 000 / 6 * 12 = 1.47% earmark bonus+ UOB One 4% EIR = 5.47% p.a. for 6 months lockin,btohqsg
5.6% also not wrong  for those really want to put in end Jul instead of 1 Jul. 🤣But the Jul interest will messed up.,btohqsg
Any 1 try before using UOB one credit use as net to pay and will lock the 500? Or credit card cannot use as net to pay?,btohqsg

Hi guys  just to check  after using the UOB debit one card for spending  how long will it take to reflect in the UOB one account for $500 min spend?,btohqsg
it will be updated the next day in the appsee other comments,btohqsg
Erm it is one day after transaction posting not after spending  have to be careful in reply when u are the admin,btohqsg
Anyone knows when using UOB ppv  in app apple pay vs using credit card itself are there any difference   if it is an eligible merchant for 4mpd,btohqsg
Debit card also need to be posted  it can take up to 14 day for debit card transaction to be posted.Debit card also goes thru visa/mastercard. It need to be posted to be count even thou money is debit immediately after usage,btohqsg
Debit card also need to be posted before it will be updated as spending for uob one  it can take up to 14 day for debit card transaction to be posted.,btohqsg
Wdym by it needs to be posted?,btohqsg
to fulfill the 500 min spending of UOB One account  the transactions need to be posted andnotpending,btohqsg
my bad. thanks for the sharing@qqplacesi will clear my comments to avoid confusion.,btohqsg

Hi all  i using uob lady with dining as bonus category.If use with changipay at dining establishments  will it be still consider as dining? Thanksp,btohqsg
Oh alright got it! Thank you :),btohqsg
If you search the chat history  the advice for the UOB one spending is dont do the transactions especially the last few days of the months for a peace of mind.,btohqsg
Depend if changipay change the mcc  although most time it dont but best to test out using amaze with uob lady on changipay to be sure,btohqsg
Debit card will post slightly slower. So don't do last minute purchases.,btohqsg

Hello Gurus! Can HSBC Revo be used on Lazada and Shopee?,btohqsg
Both have varies mcc so u are taking a hit or miss here with revo,btohqsg
Hi which card is best for overseas spend to gain 4mpd if possible - UOB Visa Signature  UOB preferred platinum  UOB lady's  DBS woman's world card or DBS vantage? Thank you,btohqsg
Uob vs as long as 1 k spend on fcy  uob ppv as long as is mobile contactless  uob lady only in your bonus cat but bundle with amaze to save on fcy fee. Dbs women world only for online. Dbs vantage got give 4mpd for fcy spending meh?,btohqsg
It's a risk using HSBC Revo for lazada and shopee due to multiple mcc. Some may connect the card to heymax  purchase refundable ones. if mcc in heymax maximizer is not valid  then cancel order. It's an option but I would not do myself.,btohqsg
Base is block of $5  bonus is accumulated for whole month’s spending.,btohqsg
Question on UOB One. I am clocking to $500 spend with the UOB debit card. Must the debit card be linked to to my UOB one account or other account also can ?,btohqsg
changipay CHANGES the mcc for me when i bought cosmetic at Shila.TLDR: Use UOB PPV with Changipay at shila safest.,btohqsg
Mcc become what?Sometime i pay with card better coz got card specific promo at shila or lotte duty free,btohqsg
Actually i realise alot of people asking lazada and shopee here for revo  why not use ocbc reward. Same 4mpd and it is merchant specific for lazada and shopee and qualify for bonus interest on ocbc 360,btohqsg
ok from what i read  changipay MCC is 5399  regardless of the merchant.changipay usually will have discount coupons for duty free in changi airport one,btohqsg
Then ppv will be the safer bet,btohqsg
To find remaining use case for Revo 😅 or to round up and transfer all out in Jan,btohqsg
Hey max voucher i guess  can be use to buy klook then buy those dinning voucher in klook etc,btohqsg
must only be linked to Uob One account.,btohqsg
I wonder for ocbc rewards 5311 6mpd  will 5311 lazada will get 6mpd or 4mpd will override?,btohqsg
Should get 6mpd for 5311 mcc  but if varies mcc that is not 5311 4mpd will take place.It is a powerful card with 6mpd on 5311 now and it qualify for ocbc 360 500 spending,btohqsg
That why either way it is sure get at least 4mpd for lazada or shopee on ocbc rewards,btohqsg

No. When you setup on CardUp  there's a set of instructions they provide. Just follow.,btohqsg
You should keep your giro plan. And set ur cardup recurring payment a few days in advance. Iras will recognize you already paid and wont charge u again,btohqsg

Hi Gurus   I’m new to MMF and keen to invest in MMF like Fullerton sgd Cash fund. There are questions to ask before investing:1.) Is investing MMF like to subscribe the MMF one time and let it grow the interest daily ? Or only earn the interest when you subscribe the MMF each time?2.) may I know should set up RSP to invest in MMF ? What are the strategies there ?Thanks in advance 😅,btohqsg
are u looking to put funds in constantly? or is just a one shot kind of thing,btohqsg
Consider either way ! What’s the difference between both way ?,btohqsg
dont rmb that it makes too much of a difference actually,btohqsg
for example  if it's on any of the platforms auto sweep  you just need to top up your funds into the broker  let it auto sweep into the MMF of your choice.,btohqsg
Does moomoo or tiger vault has auto sweep feature?,btohqsg
yup they both do. just transfer in the funds whenever you've got extra I guess. dont really need to set up an RSP,btohqsg
Does one shot works in MMF ?,btohqsg

Hi guys  any knows for HSBC Live+ - to qualify for the sign up promo  I need to spend $500. Does the $500 need to be eligible spend or any kind of spend?- the sign up promo only requires me to spend $500 on the first month? Or needs to be 3 consecutive months?- does online shopping (i.e shopee  lazada) count towards the eligible spend criteria?,btohqsg
Do you mean if customer buy US stock  it will auto deduct from customer MMF cash fund in USD to settle the outstanding?,btohqsg

For the $800 krisflyer sia promo before getting 3 miles/$  say if I fulfil the condition today  would the spending before today count as 3 miles/$?,btohqsg

May I ask 8%Cashback vs 4mpd. Which is more worth it?,btohqsg
How much do you value a mile? Then you can calculate cashback equivalent of 4mpd.,btohqsg

The value is personal I'd say. Depends on which airline  destination  econ/business/first class.https://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI,btohqsg

Like Queenie said  ocbc rewards has specific whitelisted merchants like shopee  lazada  Amazon  Mustafa for 4mpd. They will only check names in this case  not mcc.,btohqsg
This is similar to uob nation saver promo and it offers slight higher cash for the same amount of fresh fund. However  the interest for dbs multiplier is not great. For my personal use case  I am only qualified for salary credit and cc spend so I only earn 1.8% pa on first 50k or 0.9% pa on total 100k balance. 1250 for 5mths on 100k is about 3% pa. Total 3.9% pa for money being locked for 5 months. I may as well join uob nation saver. Ocbc 360 even gives higher interest without promo.,btohqsg
Hi pros  one qn on the DBS Yuu credit card. What happens if I visit a yuu merchant but I pay with my yuu credit card without scanning my yuu app. Will I still get the bonus points?,btohqsg
Thank you Anthony!!in this case  maybe choose earmark 50k  then +1.8%(from multiplier)  will get about 4%pa.ya not so worth  unless can get 2 category from multiplier.,btohqsg
You're new to DBS Multiplier account and you will deposit 50k from elsewhere to earmark it for 5 month right?I guess you will definitely spend $600 every month on POSB/DBS credit card  which will also meet the spend criteria for DBS Multiplier.,btohqsg
Ya I don’t have a DBS multiplier acct now.,btohqsg
Pretty decent with 4.04% p.a. if you're okay with locking 50k I guess. 👍🏻,btohqsg
Ah I missed that out. At 50k it's better than UOB and ocbc offers.,btohqsg
At 100k can also get 5.08% p.a. for 5 months if you don't mind throwing in $100 into RSP.,btohqsg
er.... the salary credit for DBS multiplier can use the same method like uobOne or not ? 😅,btohqsg
Hi  does uob lady’s solitaire work with simply go? Mrt and bus spending is usually less than $5  will I still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Actually 50k with $100 RSP gets 4.34% p.a. for 5 months.,btohqsg
For UOB Lady (or UOB Mastercard) on simply go  it has a quirk that transactions will post after 5 days or 15$ whichever comes first.,btohqsg
Can. I recently did a transfer from uob one (salary payment) to DBS multiplier and it was captured as eligible salary credit.,btohqsg
Same name account or different names?,btohqsg
Good news in this case is that for SimplyGo with MasterCard  they accumulate at least 5 days of trips or $15 of fares. Which will usually net you above $5 per transaction.The base points is blocks of $5 per transaction. The bonus points is blocks of $5 for the accumulated spending.,btohqsg
Are we reading the same tnc? It only excludes shopeepay 5262.,btohqsg
Like what i have reply you before shopee pay is consider top up thus which is why it is not eligible for ocbc reward.,btohqsg
Hey guys  I wonder UOB Paynow Salary from others' own bank account still working nowadays?,btohqsg
For gym membership (Safra energy one in specific)  do the citi rewards card and hsbc revolution get bonus points?,btohqsg

#dpwxyz bar at Marriott Aloft mcc is 7011 instead of Heymax mentioning 5813 and 7297 of course we can guess it but for the amount spent I decided to test it before paying.,btohqsg

Lazada always okay for me to get 6mpd 👍  not sure it’s lucked or any different mcc that not hit me,btohqsg
Uob one card as long as it’s Shopee it doesn’t matter what mcc ?,btohqsg
I would think so. But i rarely buy from shopee supermarket. Always retail item,btohqsg
Which Gaincity outlet? Go n find out if they have Favepay or ShopBack pay scan QR option to pay.,btohqsg
You will not get the base points. Still get bonus points.,btohqsg
I also don’t buy from supermarket  but once a while get the mcc supermarket 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg

Just leave it ? Take it as you prepaid some in advance if it a everyday card,btohqsg
In@ChrisHMSG’s OCBC’s videos  it says has to be transferred via a corporate account. What does that mean? 😅,btohqsg
It is UOB LADY card…but i had called UOB hotline to do the transferIt is a $1000…. So i thought it is better to get it out 😀,btohqsg
HAHAHA Okay that is a lot  I thought you meant by $100-200 🤣,btohqsg
I wanted to transfer my $ from Chocolate Finance to UOB saving accountKey in my credit card by mistake  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️…. Surprisingly it went through,btohqsg
You can use a personal account now to transfer in the salary. Must be a third party account.,btohqsg
I had the same mistake once too 😅 I accidentally transferred to CRMC but I just left it in as it my daily card anyway,btohqsg
Haha… so i am not alone 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ah yes  for certain banks their credit cards act like account numbers  allowing FAST transfers for instant repayment.Anyway the CSO should be able to help u transfer the excess payment out into your bank account.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can I check the MCC on the airport taxes and surcharges on a miles award redemption?,btohqsg
Okay so it’ll be SIA  online category?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone knows this?In the previous UOB One Big Savings Payout T&C  my earmarked period is until 16 Sep. To “prepare” for the next quarterly promotion  does it mean I should start to empty the account from 01 Sep onwards and I will also transfer the earmarked amount once it is released on the 17 Sep. Is that right?,btohqsg
Assuming same as the Q3 promo  by right cannot have any transaction in Sep (30 days before 1 Oct),btohqsg
For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a corresponding increment in the Account’s day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period AND Earmark Period as compared to the Account’s Monthly Average Balance for March 2024. - do you mean this clause?,btohqsg
I am curious would they be so stringent on this. Logically they could but it's a risk we have to take.,btohqsg
What is the risk? The earlier credited cash credit amount being clawed back?,btohqsg
No he meant literally the funds should not be moved in Sept. Not too sure how are they going to enforce it or check.,btohqsg
Yup I remember this but still curious haha,btohqsg
I guess and your interest for Sept since you withdraw the money,btohqsg
I have been moving the funds throughout the earmarked period since June till now and kept the MAB within the cap of 150k though,btohqsg
I just realised that based on the T&C  by right I must keep the day-end balance throughout the Promotion AND earmark period,btohqsg
MCC for SIA should be 3075 based onHeymax.ai,btohqsg

Depend what u spending on. My favorite is maybank fnf with amaze (800 min spend) for cashback and amaze with crmc for miles (no min spend up to 1k),btohqsg
we are all in unchartered territory loh... haha..,btohqsg
"actually STRICTLY SPEAKING  you need to keep AT ALL TIMESreference MAB + earmark amount.But this is another one of those ""how are they going to monitor/enforce""Easy to say in TNC  but whether they really CAN or WILL... nobody knows",btohqsg
but what i know is ... i heard DPsomeone signup for earmark promo on say 2nd of the month... moved in $100k.backside itchy go and move out the $100k for 1 day on 20th of the month  21st of the month put back the $100kFAILED to kenna earmark.,btohqsg
Anyone had their cash credit clawed back before ?,btohqsg
What i understand from UOB is if you accidentally sign up for the promo  this is what you can do so that the system won’t automatically earnark your deposit,btohqsg
Hi May I know how many days does UOB take from the day I submitted my application to the date account account opened for UOB ladies saving account ?,btohqsg
most of us with existing UOB relationship / singpass open  is instant like 10 minutes,btohqsg
From immediate to as long as 3 weeks actually,btohqsg

my very first application was immediate.,btohqsg
Not really half a working day.. half day.. i applied on Sunday morning 1am before and approved in the morning around 9-10am,btohqsg
It differs from profile to profile i guess,btohqsg

Hey guys I have a question about amaze card. I have a uob lady’s card right. Den if I pair with amaze card 1. Does this mean any card spend on any category will earn 4 miles per dollar (1k capped)2. Do I have to pick certain category on my lady’s card  if so  which category?,btohqsg
Fairly decent rate given that 2y SGS is around 3.3+% and local retail doesn’t assign much risk premium to endowments,btohqsg
You only earn 4mpd for the category you chose  other wise it's 0.4mpd.  Which category depends on what you mostly spend on.,btohqsg
Yea more like another avenue to park your spare cash without any risk,btohqsg
Oh So the only benefits  lady’s card by itself vs pairing with amaze will be1. Foreign currency spend (lower fees)?2. Maybe some instarem points ?,btohqsg
i believe him.. because they usually have 'pre sale' briefing to the kiasu agents..and also the 'priority' clients who will get allocation before it opens,btohqsg
often  insurers use such 'hot products' as a marketing campaign to drum up interest in their products / brand name..most people will end up with 'sorry no more liao',btohqsg
so ask your agent backif there are no priority clients  how can 50% be sold before email came out?,btohqsg
Yea it moves very fast! Last tranche it sold out quite fast too,btohqsg
i am telling you.. there are reserved/priority tranches.if don't know of such things.. means not in the inner circle.,btohqsg
They have their own inside info first before the email is sent out  to every agents,btohqsg
Not really this time move faster cause got both OA + cash  last time my agent told me only cash,btohqsg
Yes  same happens for things like IPO and hot condo launches. Certain groups gets first dibs.,btohqsg
as i already explained  if the FIRST EMAIL blast to all agents came out.. and it is already 50% SOLD..What does that tell u,btohqsg
yes some people just don't get it... and with such evidence already displayed.. what can i say,btohqsg
my agent already sent this 2 weeks ago haha,btohqsg
The point is not the info...It is WHY when it opens to public  it is already 50% sold.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have prepaid all my outstanding bill with IRAS in Jun for July due.. but this morning realised there was giro done by iras. Anyone encounter this issue before?,btohqsg
U use cardup? It might occur if u schedule cardup too near to giro date. Giro is initiate a few work day before so always best to pay at least 1 week earlier,btohqsg
AIA agents received information about Wealth Savvy (III) last month  so some agents have already been sending this information to their clients since then to gather interest.It was announced only on July 5th (Friday) that the guaranteed returns would be 3.38%.The product was launched this morning at 9:30 am. Agents would have sent their links to all parties who expressed interest by that time to sign up as soon as possible. This explains why it was already 50% sold by 10:30 am  just 2 hours after launch,btohqsg
If double pay  iras will refund the extra amt pay,btohqsg
Thanks queenie.. curious if iras will take it as next month payment then no refund?,btohqsg
Is it fine to put my amazecard in google wallet for contactless payment?,btohqsg
if you don't upfront inform IRAS  they will usually refund within 1 week (they don't like to hold surplus payment),btohqsg
What if I don't want to pay the annual fee?,btohqsg
What to invest for 20k ?,btohqsg

It's a membership. No membership  no card.,btohqsg
Citi prestige is strictly not waiving annual fee.,btohqsg
Ok. Means I won't get pass the application and won't get the card if I don't pay the annual fee,btohqsg
Application didnt check for AF as far as i know. Once the card is approved  it will show up in citi app. AF will be charged to your card. If you call to waive the fee  they will say no and cancel the card.,btohqsg

T-bills will be better for short term 👍🏼 need to review every 3-6months.With interest rates set to fall… e.g. you get 4x 6mths T-bills for nxt 2 years at• 3.7%• 3.2%• 2.7%• 2.2%Average interest rate 2.95% p.a.However  if interest rate were to remain high  T-bills will win.

Hihi  I’m kinda confused with kris miles and heymax miles valuation  and how one can used the max miles to claim free flight. Any one able to explain thanks,btohqsg
Max miles can be transfer to airline loyalty program or if u have sufficient max miles u can claim your flight receipt with max miles by submitting the flight receipt after your travel for 1.8cent per miles.Kris miles belong to sq loyalty program and can only be redeem on sq or their partner airline in the alliance.Valuation of miles is highly up to individual perception.,btohqsg
Dont mind sharing how long it took for you to get it approved?,btohqsg
So isit worth converting the miles to Krisflyer miles or using it to claim the free flight?If I’m understanding it correctly  purchasing flight ticket on the website via heymax won’t exactly award us with the exactl heymax miles for flight redemption am I right?That means we would have to accumulate heymax miles from other spending too ?,btohqsg
Krisflyer is not yet a transfer partner of heymax.Earning enough heymax miles to claim against a paid flight would take quite substantial spending through heymax unless you are a finance creator that get miles everytime a user click the referral link.😜,btohqsg
So why is people saying you can claim the full amount of a flight ticket for free via heymax miles?I assume I would have to accumulate my max miles via spending then claim back used it as a form of cashback to claim the full air ticket?,btohqsg
U need to accumulate full amt in term of heymax miles before u can use it to submit a claim for the flight cost with receipt at 1.8 cent per heymax miles.Dont think heymax miles can be use partially,btohqsg
Oh do you earn miles on heymax and also your usual cards?,btohqsg
Yes if u done it correctly for hey max based on their instruction. U will get card miles regardless as long as u spend,btohqsg
Yes. Use shop with max (finicky)  signup bonus (singsaver) or heymax vouchers (reliable),btohqsg
Usual credit card spends will earn ur usual cc rewards,btohqsg
Approved same day as existing customer. Received card after ~1week,btohqsg
CSO doesn't seem to have any clue. Thanks for the DP.,btohqsg
If approved on the same day as existing customer  are you able to use it through immediately without waiting for the card to arrive?,btohqsg
So how hard is it to accumulated heymax miles ?,btohqsg
It is not hard  just that u have to keep spending lol,btohqsg
From your opinion  is better to just stick to kris+ or shopback?,btohqsg

Did u know if the person submitted?,btohqsg
This offer ends already? Only for New or existing customer can apply?,btohqsg
But be careful don’t spread too thin and too many.Lose track and Kenna expired miles,btohqsg
Heymax seems to be online purchases only  unlike shop back where we can scan we code  so we kinda limited on what we can spend,btohqsg
Yes. U at their mercy.Wait till u open investment banking accounts and see the document requests they have. lol,btohqsg
Also for tour packages  heymax miles can’t be earned unless we travelling on our own and book our own attraction and hotels,btohqsg
They should be expanding since it is quite new like when shopback first start out. But i would think their timing is not as good as shopback when it was a time full of cheap money from angel investor then,btohqsg
Interesting..What’s make you used shopback over heymax then? From my understanding cashback on shopback is very little.,btohqsg
Let me just give 2 lol examples:1. Photo of housing with yourself inside2. Birth cert of parent,btohqsg
Not really  it come about the same as heymax miles. I just need 10 dollar cashback to cashout for shopback. U need to accumulate a substantial amt of heymax miles to make it useful claim for flight or transfer to airline partner,btohqsg
Yes you are right.  Am I right to say that after 15th July  I still can continue receive 10x points using Revo+Favepay/Shopback with the correct MCC code?,btohqsg
Do you know what’s heymax “cashback %” like ?Shopback usually is around 1-2% with some places offering 12%,btohqsg
Hi  when i pay petrol at esso fairprice  the transaction is Esso Fairprice. May i know whether citi cashback card will reward petrol bonus cashback for this?,btohqsg
U have to compare both at same time  shopback run upsize cashback about the same time with heymax. I am using 1.8 cent per miles to compare both at the same time on merchant i use. I would not of course be so free to compare every single merchant especially those i dont use.And like what i have stated before. U will need substantial spending before u can actually get a significant amt of heymax miles to offset flight or transfer to airline to make it useful. That is alot of patience and spending unless u can get alot of referral point,btohqsg
was thinking to get uob VI... but seems citi one is so nice for existing other card holder.... does citi thankyou point pool? as i have CRMC in hand now,btohqsg
Yes this is almost the same as miles cards vs cashback cards. Miles accumulation takes a long time to see results while cashback is more immediate.,btohqsg
I see thanks!! 🙏. Will read up more into optimising my return tgt with krismiles,btohqsg
Just like to highlight krisflyer not yet a transfer partner of heymax,btohqsg
Yeap ik   thanks. But we can still used the heymax miles to redeem for flight ticket bought via SQ or scoot rightThen used Krisflyer miles to upgrade to business?,btohqsg
I suppose so. Usually i just use full miles for redemption,btohqsg
Max miles have good use case to offset econ tix or low cost carriers to nearby destinations.,btohqsg
I supposed miles valuation also fluctuates with times  mostly is depreciating right?,btohqsg
Even domestic flights w it is good,btohqsg
Econ ticket means any ticket say from SG to Japan which cost $1.2k also can redeem?  Say via SIA or Japan Airlines?,btohqsg
U will need 60 plus k heymax miles for 1.2k ticket,btohqsg
So essentially  to redeem  its the cost of the ticket x 0.018 yeah,btohqsg
I am thinking more of those in the range of 200-500sgd.,btohqsg
For example if i have 5000 miles  i can claim 5000x0.018 which is 90?,btohqsg
Miles have to enough for full ticket cost. U cant claim partial i think,btohqsg
Yeap that’s why I read up.So with some sites offering 4max miles per $  is that considered high as compared to credit card giving 4mpd on revo or lady etcc,btohqsg
It does not interfere with the credit card reward system. It is a stack up infact.So u can see 4 heymax miles similar to 4 mpd given by card. Just that it can only be use in heymax eco system,btohqsg
max miles is max miles  card rewards is card rewards. These two coexist,btohqsg
Ik but from a miles valuation perspective,btohqsg
“So u can see 4 heymax miles similar to 4 mpd given by card. Just that it can only be use in heymax eco system”Ok Understood!!,btohqsg
Miles valuation is very subjective. Like i find buying miles at 1 cent per miles is ex but some other can find it attractive for example.,btohqsg
Sorry for the dumb question but how do people derive these miles valuation? CPM..,btohqsg
U can see chris video on youtube,btohqsg
So 4mpd us essentially 25cents per miles,btohqsg
25c per mile is extremely high :),btohqsg
Hi all  1 question i booked hotel on agoda(free cancelation deal)using my ocbc card to hit the sgd500 spend criteria in jun  now i found a better deal on agoda and would like to cancel last month booking and rebook another hotel.Question: does it affect my last month(jun) 500 spending interest bonus ?,btohqsg
I think u will have to clock more for this month,btohqsg
Should affect  similarly to UOB one account card refunds (since it means u never spent the money),btohqsg
planning to apply for Maybank F&F cc  does anyone know what’s the typical statement date? would help with planning my expenses this month,btohqsg
Cashback goes by calendar month and posting date anyway,btohqsg
by calendar month you mean if i apply now  i have only 20 more days to hit the $800 min spend?,btohqsg
Yes. Only transactions posted by 31-July will count,btohqsg
This is Ocbc 360 account. Can anyone explain why the numbers doesn’t seem right? My account has slightly more than 100k  even if it’s 100k shouldn’t the interest be more than this?,btohqsg
I see the card in hsbc app in one week  just see it on this Sunday actually,btohqsg
Looks correct to me. Rmb june has 30 days for interest calculation.,btohqsg
They use Monthly Available Balance (MAB) to calculate. You need to check your monthly statement to see the MAB for the month.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if monthly CPF contribution + bonus already meet the annual CPF limit   CPF will refund any voluntary top up (MA or SA)  question is do we still enjoy tax relief ?,btohqsg
Gives take photo with fork on head vibes,btohqsg
I think you're confusing VC3A with VCMA and RSTU. VCMA is only limited by BHS and RSTU is only limited by FRS.Your employer's contributions would be refunded if excess of annual contribution limit.,btohqsg
Anyone know what card to use for mcc 8699 for miles,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? It's a great tool to check what card to use.,btohqsg
Hi all  if I charge $4k to insurance can it be considered as $2k spend on Maybank platinum card ?,btohqsg
No. For tier (300/1000/2000) calculations only half can be insurance (150/500/1000),btohqsg
If you split 1k to pay with CardUp  yes.,btohqsg
For $2k tier insurance is allowed up to $1k only  rest $1k must be non-insurance,btohqsg
You said $4k insurance premium clocks full $2k spend.,btohqsg
You are giving him false information. It’s not like half of the insurance counted. Only half of the tier requirement can be fulfilled with insurance  the other halfmust benon-insurance,btohqsg
Hi. My hubby and me did the fast transfer via uob and the paynow via ocbc to each other with salary description. We did not get the salary bonus for 360 account. Any idea what went wrong? Thank you.,btohqsg
I c so meaning even I charge 5k insurance still only 1k is counted,btohqsg
What mechanic? Bonus interest calculation? Most banks calculate bonus interest with MAB. You can check their t&c to be sure.,btohqsg
Can I pay the other $1k with card up?,btohqsg
Yes I just said it earlier. Pay $1k directly  $1k with CardUp.The rest can GIRO through HSBC EGA or pay using eligible UOB cards to clock min spend for UOB One account (then GIRO cc payment through HSBC EGA).,btohqsg
Okok thanks for the advice !,btohqsg
purpose selected as 'salary payment' from dropdown list? description dun matter,btohqsg
Do you see the tracker in ocbc 360 last month?,btohqsg
Both is personal account? So confirm the scenario is:1. Person A's (personal) UOB to Person B's (personal) OCBC2. Person B's (personal) OCBC to Person A's (personal) UOB,btohqsg
I din manage to see it last month. Is the tracker updated fast? Thinking i can do the transfer for July now and see if it works,btohqsg
The tracker is usually updated within 1 business day. Should just track once available.,btohqsg
I din realise ocbc have this tracker until much later so din manage to check last month. Will do another transfer today and monitor for July,btohqsg
Suggest just do FAST on UOB TMRW with salary crediting as purpose. At least got dp that it works this way.,btohqsg
The HSBC travel one can I use to buy vouchers in heymax to qualify the $500 eligible transactions ?,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you all. Will try that today,btohqsg
I thought she said she did FAST alsoAnyone has dp to say that this actually works?,btohqsg
"what i gather from ur post is that u are doing ""salary trf to OCBC 360 acc right? OCBC salary acc requires from corporate acc as SAL only.",btohqsg
UOB one is the acc that allows fast trf or paynow as salary payment,btohqsg
Oh. For uob  Need do transfer between same name or different name account?,btohqsg
For Fast to UOB  you can do from same name as long you choose the correct category. But I suggest still use a different name  you will never know when UOB will tighten their criteria to be same as OCBC.,btohqsg
She said UOB internet banking not UOB TMRW app.,btohqsg
Multiple dps available for OCBC 360 salary transfer through FAST from different name. Do search the chat first.,btohqsg
haha this one not yet.My guess is they are sample checking details that you mention during KYC to try and ensure you are not talking rubbish.,btohqsg
what’s the easiest and cheapest way to transfer USD from SG local bank multi currency account  to IB without any conversion?,btohqsg
Anybody pays income tax by cardup but schedules the due date about 14 calendar days before the 6th of each month? I know cardup recommends the 12th for payment but want to get a sense of whether it’s enough time for iras to receive and reconcile the payment if it’s 2 weeks lead time,btohqsg
I schedule on 24th. Works for me,btohqsg
Similar issue. Have setup HSBC EGA to pay my income tax  IRAS portal shows date of deduction but didnt happened  call hsbc say no setup of giro per my account  call iras said they send confirmation and if not confirm will not show up on my portal. Going in circles now,btohqsg
Awesome thanks for sharing. It’s my first month of starting with cardup but I stupidly went to terminate my usual bank transfer to the account I use for income tax debiting. In the end giro never deduct and I was wary about leaving the first cardup due date as 12th as it might screw up the next attempted deduction by iras on the 20th.But good to know 24th works  thanks again jimmy,btohqsg
Some schedule 1 week before also. But risky.,btohqsg
If you are going to use CardUp  then just any bank will do. Especially those with eGIRO available.,btohqsg
Yeah saw on cardup articles also that say better don’t cut it so close,btohqsg
anyway its on credit for the same month. so no diff if pay 1 week earlier using cc,btohqsg
So@MelvynEzi  what we need to do is use phone to do FAST transfer and choose drop-down list as salary  and NOT use the internet transfer salary?Also to use different name,btohqsg
unfamiliar w giro here - setting up giro to HSBC EGA is only by form and post isit? i saw on the portal egiro only DBS and OCBC,btohqsg
Used my amaze+citi rewards just now in the supermkt  about 2.5% off spot  i guess ok for not widely traded currency?,btohqsg
how long does the giro set up take… and what happens if giro not up yet and deduction was attempted by iras?,btohqsg
they will try again mid month,btohqsg
For giro with HSBC ega  come to this website. Download the form  print and fill it in. Then you can send it at singpost without stamp.https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments/giro-individual-income-tax,btohqsg
Fyi - i just read uob terms. Seems like fast transactions are excluded for salary credit. Only giro and paynow.,btohqsg
"This is not my experience crediting ""salary"" to uob",btohqsg
so my situation now is tax payable 22 July - if i want to set up GIRO to HSBS EGA  surely will miss 1-2 of the monthly payments. In this case how ah? Will they late charge me or is there an alternative way i can pay for the first month GIRO not yet set up?,btohqsg
How about giro with dbs/ocbc first? HSBC giro will override it later.,btohqsg
can the egiro w dbs get set up quickly?,btohqsg
and then when i set up another giro w HSBC  it will auto cancel the one with dbs?,btohqsg
In the same IRAS link I posted earlier  they say within 3 days for dbs  ocbc  uob. I set up mine long ago but I vaguely remember it was fast. And yes  HSBC giro will override existing giro setup. You can check status on iras portal.,btohqsg
Hi! Any tax experts here? Does anybody know if we need to withhold any taxes if paid for overseas services?,btohqsg
Not sure also. Just read from website. I be happy if it works though.,btohqsg
amazing  thank you. Just on EGA  i’m planning to giro all my cc bills to EGA to earn that extra 1%. Any potential cons of doing that? Worried in terms of payment dates etc cuz never use giro before,btohqsg
and on the everyday+ rewards  assuming every start of month i just trf in 2k++  make 5 transactions out via FAST should be qualify alr right? after i get the text say qualify  can i trf out the 2k or need leave there?,btohqsg
No cons really. I guess u need to keep enough balance in ur ega account. Some may forget as its not your primary bank acct.,btohqsg
What i do is setting automatic transfer on first day of the month. 2k from dbs in and 5 transactions of 1 dollars out back to dbs. 😆 you can transfer out the 2k but please leave some balance for giro deductions.,btohqsg

Hi all  I am looking for acard solely for grocery spend. I can only spend about $100 on groceries per month. I think for cashback  the citi 1.6% cashback card is the choiceBut for miles card  which miles card would be recommended for such a low $ spend? Thank you for any tips/advice!,btohqsg
I don’t have residential address in SingaporeDo you guys have any solution?HSBC not allow company address,btohqsg
I don’t have any Homestay in SgI work remote,btohqsg
you might want to stick to purely cashback card for now.Just being blunt and honest.you spend $100 groceries a month x 3 years = $3600no miles card can generate enough miles for your $3.6k spend before the miles expire for you to redeem anything meaningful,btohqsg
incorporate the spend with a cards that can earn miles on grocery spend among other general spend (like citirewards + amaze),btohqsg
another way is buy heymax grocery store vouchers. heymax miles dont expire,btohqsg
OP only wants to spend $100 though  also will take a long time to get enough to redeem for anything.,btohqsg

May as well get cashback. Miles will devalue as well.,btohqsg

Interactive Brokers. but best practice to have order transactions and not just use it as an FX machine💹 Interactive Brokers:https://hmsg.link/ibkr💹 IBSG Sign-uphttps://hmsg.link/ibsg,btohqsg
I have investment account   but how to transfer usd to bank account for free? Or is always with a fee.. Reason is I want to consolidate my usd  is too messy,btohqsg
USD from IBKR... IBKR is free.. but receiving bank will always charge USD10 (due to charge from Correspondent Bank),btohqsg
actually Interactive Brokers is a good place to hold your USD toorelatively safe and they pay decent interest on USD balances,btohqsg
is there any interest for SGD balances?,btohqsg
i would place USD with them. I won't place SGD with them.,btohqsg
If have quite huge amount of usd. Can buy us tbills in secondary market too.,btohqsg
what is the minimum size for USTs in IBKR?,btohqsg
JP Morgan is the intermediary bank for DBS in US. They will always jiak me $10usd when i transfer from IBKR to DBS MCA SG. Then SG side will deduct another 10sgd,btohqsg
oh wait.. by right... DBS should not makan you another SGD10,btohqsg
I always call DBS to waive. But they always act blur... say they dont know why JP Morgan US is taking 10usd for each transfer,btohqsg
USD10... is true.. they CANNOT waive.. nobody can.,btohqsg
the right charge is 10sgd by DBS MCA SG. not 10usd by JP Morgan US.,btohqsg
no.. the correct charge is USD10 by Correspondent Bank Jp Morgan.The SGD10 is DBS ownself want to makan you one,btohqsg
Are you DBS Treasures? From what I know  DBS Treasures dont need to pay 10sgd. The right charge is really 10sgd and not 10 usd by JP Morgan hahaI checked many times with those IBKR user in the IBKR group leh,btohqsg
let me rephrase..has anyone u heard of  whether IBKR group or here..manage to get the USD10 fee waived?,btohqsg
I got it waived each time the 10usd is charged by JP Morgan on top of the 10sgd charged by DBS SG (10sgd cannot waive). Or rather DBS SG credit me back 10usd  so net net i only pay 10sgd,btohqsg
Using IBKR SG to withdraw USD to DBS MyAccount USD  no 10 USD charge  only 10 SGD charge,btohqsg
yes this is the correct one,btohqsg
who does IBKR SG use to hold USD?,btohqsg
but did u check... if u transfer 5000usd out from IBKR  does 5000usd end up in DBS MCA? haha or 4990 usd come in only 😝,btohqsg
To be exact  7.40 USD is deducted (equivalent to 10 SGD),btohqsg
ok anyway my experience is no matter where transfer USD to where..there is always a USD10 fee by Correspondent Bank.Unless one of your accounts (Sender or Recipient) is an account with the Correspondent Bank  cannot waive the USD10 one. If refund or credit  is the RM/Cost Center of the Receiving Bank give you one.On the other hand  the SGD10 is a fee levied by DBS for receiving Foreign Currency in lieu of FX Exchange  which is a fee DBS wants to makan (means DBS can waive if they want to).,btohqsg
Why I say the USD10 cannot waive  is because it is charged by the correspondent bank  per wire  and they don't see who or how big the client is.They just charge USD10 per transaction.,btohqsg
i withdraw 5580usd from IBKR US,btohqsg
5570usd came in. JP Morgan US (DBS intermediary) makan 10usd and then DBS SG jiak another 7.35usd,btohqsg
yes CORRECT (from my experience).The USD10 auto deducted.. no way to waive (yes your DBS RM maybe can credit you back  but it is from DBS ownself give you one)  they cannot control JP Morgan AUTO DEDUCTION.The SGD10... haha.. i no comment.. i never get such deductions before.,btohqsg
Does ocbc global currency account charge 10& also? I recently opened in app haven't used.,btohqsg
Thanks  I have signed up for those brokers n gotten a few stocks less than 100 usd in tiger  moomoo. Wanted to sell n buy all in 1 broker.. Hmm  think cannot liao cause of the charge,btohqsg
Anyone knows if uob lady work well with amaze. Which category will amaze fall under?,btohqsg
one more question  which CC have one of the better FX?,btohqsg
Credit cards have fairly similar fx (3.25% + underlying card provider rate)  except for trust credit card (which is very close to Google rate),btohqsg
btw u should be looking at the rewards/cashback less the fx fees/markup  not just fx fees/markup only.,btohqsg
Any recommendation?I’m recently closed my evol card and swap it into uob 1 cc - trying “train” a saving habit with uob one.Not sure what to do after I spend the 500 on my uob1 cc.,btohqsg
Trust card if STRICTLY going by fx rate (0%). This is the way if you are strictly into cost minimisation in your fx spending. As others have said  if you want cc rewards on top  Amaze with a suitable mastercard is your magic bullet,btohqsg
Saw many recommended citi rewards with amaze. Is this one of the best way moving forwards?,btohqsg
one of the best for S$1k foreign spend in statement month  except for travel/transport and other common exclusions,btohqsg
the best is subjective. It's the simplest strategy for day to day spend.,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Some other Mastercards (UOB Lady's and OCBC Rewards) can earn superior mileage (6mpd) provided the right conditions are met. Also  Citi Rewards blacklists travel purchases so you have to bear that in mind,btohqsg

Hi all just got my first credit card and need some clarification. There are 2 dates on my statement:Statement date: 19th JunePayment due date: 15th JulyIs payment due date the last date I can pay for this particular statement cycle? And does the rewards systems resets at every statement date for a new cycle?,btohqsg
yes correct but depending on some banks take a few working days to process payment  best u pay 1 week before the payment due datesome bank reward system follow statement date  some banks follow month cycle  not same,btohqsg
yes due date is the last date that the bank receive payment without incurring late fee/interest  note that it may take a couple of days for payment to reach bank depending how u pay.Rewards system may follow statement month or calendar month depending which card,btohqsg

and of course.. always ask this..Any discount IF YOU PAY CASH?to put it another way... if the banquet can be paid with cash and u get a 10% discount.. it might be better off paying cash compared to using credit cards,btohqsg

For the average mid-income Singaporean - is this credit card strategy for a hotel wedding banquet still the best/still relevant? Or have any become nerf-ed?,btohqsg
Still viable provided the hotel doesn't markup the fee by the credit card transaction fee...most important as said is find out the MCC used by the hotel / payment methods  then u can plan which cards to apply for / sign up bonuses,btohqsg
