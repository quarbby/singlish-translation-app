I can afford a year for full time studies,btohqsg
Not like those classes sit down kind :(,btohqsg
if u die die want go sci degree in local uni,btohqsg
But the teaching style itself is good,btohqsg
then i dont think u have any other choice other than to do SATs or As,btohqsg
As gonna be extremely tough as a self learner,btohqsg
i mean u can def try apply with just ur dip,btohqsg
sg SAT prep clsses that arent online is very ex,btohqsg
Iâ€™m ok for the price la,btohqsg
have a specific course in mind alrd. But if I need to take a lvls thn I might aim even high like nus or ntu,btohqsg
I think SAT would be better overall for you but if you wanna do A levels also can  you prob need to put in alot alot of effort,btohqsg
I heard the mcat is more popular. U wan to apply to Duke?,btohqsg
Do you plan to go overseas and study? If so  you might want to ask in the Singapore Global Network groups (for overseas Singaporeans). A lot of students in there.,btohqsg
Yes  why? If you want to study overseas I can give you the link to the groups. They are official groups created by the government for this pandemic but feel free to ask such questions. But you have to tell me which country as there are different groups for different regions.,btohqsg
You can also ask about visas  travel arrangements etc.,btohqsg
Wa I rlly wanted to study overseas too! Whr u studying howâ€™s life there,btohqsg
my dream is to study in China or Taiwan ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
I'll keep where I'm studying a secret. I don't wish to announce so much information about myself to 2000 people.Studying overseas is a very good experience. I turned down my NUS and NTU offers. I am currently studying mathematics. I find the support quite good over there.I get to travel more often by studying overseas I guess... And it also incentivises me to travel around South East Asia whenever I am in Singapore.,btohqsg
You also get to broaden your perspectives,btohqsg
Most of the 2000 people don't even read the chat lmao,btohqsg
The ones that chat regularly aren't even like 50 people,btohqsg
What about read reguarly or happen to read it? Haha. Don't know if someone else I know is here,btohqsg
Still rly interesting :) stay safe tho,btohqsg
I see. It's your choice bro,btohqsg
Does it encourage u to live overseas or do u prefer to stay in sg,btohqsg
I'm in Singapore now. I don't wish to travel back there for now. And there are travel restrictions in place,btohqsg
Overseas more freedom but if your parents not millionaire then have fun working part time,btohqsg
I have lived overseas for nearly all my life. But if you want to go overseas now  apply to countries such as the UK with no travel restrictions in place,btohqsg
U learn how to calculate rent and expenses,btohqsg
Like you touch wood you die or get shot up no one knows till a week later,btohqsg
More freedom as in parents not the location actually,btohqsg
You need to quickly adapt to the new laws there if they are stricter in certain aspects,btohqsg
I quite like the way uk n us students do it... 20+ can move out and rent no need stay w parents till 35,btohqsg
But part time overseas tend to get higher wages than Singapore,btohqsg
But its quite tough on them,btohqsg
Even if have sg so small  rental isnâ€™t cheap,btohqsg
at sec 4 dec hols i want explore the working world,btohqsg
some company had the audacity to advertise $3/h like wtf,btohqsg
Not true nowadays. Rent and cost of housing is expensive so many still live with parents until marriage or can afford it. Not so much the US I think,btohqsg
And its not an easy job that they are asking,btohqsg
In US I feel they still have the American Dream thing in them,btohqsg
Then they want to go out and own a lot even though they have nothing,btohqsg
But US cities are very dangerous,btohqsg
u can buy a gun used to kill someone for $5,btohqsg
i watch their gang documentaries and interviews,btohqsg
I had a friend working there he got chased for being an Asian,btohqsg
My sch alumni went overseas exchange and he said the best thing is to suck it up and ignore it,btohqsg
I have never been as well. I have only been to 14 countries and have not been to the Americas or Africa.,btohqsg
Some people have been to 100+,btohqsg
