French drivers as defined by top gear 😂😂😂 the citroens and Peugeots,btohqsg
Produce in Korea and send to Europe hard cause of import taxes  because of the higher volumes  actually cheaper to produce in Europe,btohqsg
Like BMW  Mercedes  etc. have factories in the US and Mexico instead of sending over from Germany,btohqsg
some models of Hyundai in Sg are actually made in Europe,btohqsg
yuppp because they are primarily european market models,btohqsg
the tucson and i30 I believe,btohqsg
Most Audi models also made in Hungary,btohqsg

For the more mass market ones coming to Singapore  like the Q3  e-Tron in Belgium and Q5 SB in Mexico,btohqsg

To replace your blue e92 👀,btohqsg
Who knows what is the COE price today later. Thanks,btohqsg
Poor or even lack of low carbon strategy is exactly what quite a few of us here have been talking about. And again  I’m not necessarily saying Teslas or EV are bad. But to say go buy EVs if you want to do your part for the environment is not a great one to say the least because the carbon footprint that goes into making an EV or generating the electricity for it might not be better than an ICE vehicle as many studies have shown  including the ones which Mr@arnavgulianihas shared.,btohqsg
From a share investment perspective  coming down from a high of $1200 to about $700 today  it might not mean it is not a good stock to buy today,btohqsg
Especially on a long term perspective,btohqsg
if pierce thru 600.. all hell will break loose,btohqsg
Does your E92 M3 come with a beautiful GT wing too?,btohqsg
Won’t lah won’t lah. He will go twit or something to generate some hype,btohqsg
I just buy and accumulate hehe,btohqsg

The art of road hogging   even try to accelerate  but car too slowhttps://fb.watch/d5sV1Ee3xw/,btohqsg
The porsche could've just gone honestly. cam car probably didn't see him coming and he moved out of the way after completing his overtake,btohqsg
Porsche angry that the cam car don’t want give way and still want to accelerate by trying to block him,btohqsg
Cam car angry not able to block Porsche as Porsche is very fast   so post video,btohqsg
both in the wrong  but porsche could've let it go as a mistake,btohqsg
