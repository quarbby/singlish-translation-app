generally  many people take pute.. I don't have much say for this because I take comb.for comb  id say it can be equally stressful. pure vs combined- pure is a subject alone  combined is joined tgt. so let's say that ur chemistry is better  then it'll greatly affect ur phy/bio grade.. esp if you wan go jc.. imagine your chem A1 but ur bio is B4 or so  then there goes your chance of going sci stream jc. if I'm not wrong  pure and comb have same number of lessons per week  this cld mean  pure- lessons more rushed since there's more chapters  but usually pure sci classes have extra classes after school,btohqsg
to add on  people in combined science learn less as compared to pure science  which explains why pure science lessons are generally more rushed as mentioned above,btohqsg
not sure how many chapters per se  though,btohqsg
My school actually pure got more lessons,btohqsg
And pure sci class usually the one that are released later,btohqsg
comb sci is around 70% of pure sci syllabus,btohqsg
Pure sci and humanities get extra lesson,btohqsg
I mean they have more extra classes but not sure if it's optional class or remedial,btohqsg
I don't have..... mines only remedial bcz I suck at geog#slayy,btohqsg
For me pure sci got more curriculum time,btohqsg
ok I'm saying for my sch  all sch diff,btohqsg
@s4nc7uaryuw u can check w ur snrs,btohqsg
My Geog was like 6 period a week iirc,btohqsg
Is it worth it taking h2 geog just cos you love pure geog,btohqsg

Kinda want to go jc mostly because of h2 geog,btohqsg
Cos what if im in jc then idl geog already,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ideal in jc,btohqsg
Yea just don‚Äôt take h2 Geog,btohqsg
Or rlly think about it again if uw do a llv,btohqsg
but can be very easy once you understand,btohqsg
Yes especially if you don‚Äôt take amath,btohqsg
even for me I took A math.,btohqsg
H2 math can still be a challenge.,btohqsg
and u are expected to form your own strategy.H2 math is like swimming inside the ocean. and have to endure 3h of pain,btohqsg
is like your parents hold you while you ride a bicycle.but for H2 math  you are on your own riding your own bicycle.the same concept. let say like Maximum and minimum.but A math is alot more guided.than H2 math is I take out some information then you are expected to do it by yourself.,btohqsg
idk sia later I go see aHahaha,btohqsg
wa brah first time ure not going to disturb me for 3 hours üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg

doesnt matter how nice the subj is  studying for exams wld make u dislike it,btohqsg
that's the reason combi sci is most bo hua,btohqsg
imagine study 140% for pure sci for only 1 grade,btohqsg
yes u need ur rest for tmrws paper,btohqsg
it's not as hard. It builds on A Maths foundation.Any weak links in A Maths will cause trouble in H2 Math.,btohqsg
