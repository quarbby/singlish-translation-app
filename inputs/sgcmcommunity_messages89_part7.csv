I support and thank you for that!,btohqsg
Our point being that the intention might not be to create a bias however it ends up creating one anyway as can be seen in the comment. And for cases where driver at fault is easily identifiable  the make of the car might just be creating a stereotype hurting other drivers around,btohqsg
Which was an expected and true enough.. such an outcome!,btohqsg
This kind of thing only like what,btohqsg
At worst is few months jail,btohqsg
What do you all think about banning from driving for life as a punishment for certain offences,btohqsg
Actually it depends on severity and the sentencing is done on a case to case basis,btohqsg
There is a minimum and maximum sentence but our btt rule books usually only mention the minimum for bigger violations like this,btohqsg
The guy is alive and if the driver is clean and say sorry in court,btohqsg
hehe loser merc and bmw drivers,btohqsg
Huh? What if the victim become disabled or what? - E,btohqsg
mazda and volvo wont crash into people👹👹👹👹👹,btohqsg
I think up to 3 years in jail?,btohqsg
That's like nothing compared to the victim sia - E,btohqsg
All of this is taken into account during proceedings,btohqsg
That's why they take longer to get sentenced,btohqsg
Because victim's condition cannot be judged immediately,btohqsg
so if  coma for 5 years then die  revise the driver's penalty?,btohqsg
They’ll be judging from the coma,btohqsg
The family also can bring it up again in court,btohqsg
Since there is a statute of limitations to how long they can wait,btohqsg
In that case they usually sign away their right to bring it up again,btohqsg
can always count on our friendly telegram  lawyers ☺️,btohqsg
And if I’m not wrong  it’s super expensive right,btohqsg
There's legal clinics that one can go through,btohqsg
Unless can find someone to do it pro bono,btohqsg
Then legal fees can be expensive,btohqsg
That’s why you make friends with lawyers,btohqsg
And you don't know if you'll get paid during the ruling as part of compensation or not,btohqsg
So it can be a gamble,btohqsg
But in appeal cases and in more complex cases  it's not advisable,btohqsg
Albeit for the first case  it will likely be a public prosecutor fighting the case on your behalf,btohqsg
For an appeal it's upto you,btohqsg
No amount of compensation can restore the life or the quality of life of the victim. Its really just plain “sibei suey”. Lets all hope the victim will make a full and speedy recovery 🤗🤗,btohqsg
no la! the accident really...no words to describe,btohqsg
if got good returns...i dun mind,btohqsg
I hope your returns SLAAAPPPPPPP   slayyyyy big time and are stonks!!!!!,btohqsg
ya  thank you very much ah,btohqsg
the driver should be alert at all times leh,btohqsg

Hi all. I m driving a white colour Suzuki Swift. I was at BLK 210 Hougang Street 21 carpark (behind Kovan Hawker Centre) today (26/10) afternoon. At approximately 12.15pm ~ 12.20pm  I on my hazard light  stationed my car and let my colleague alight. There was no car at the surrounding. After one of my colleague alighted  a Volkswagen white colour Van GBL8321J came from behind and collided into my bumper. The van driver then shifted the van forward in front of my car. Initially he agreed to pay for the repair / report insurance. But now he turns against his own words that he is not paying and not reporting insurance.Trying my luck here and sincerely appreciate if any one has video footage of this incident and share with me. Many thanks. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
if you have video submit to insurance company  pay for your own repair  first,btohqsg
it will take months for insurance company to resolve but if you have video simple case,btohqsg
Unfortunately  when I try to download my car cam video  the file was corrupted:(,btohqsg
Not sure. Maybe I can try to revisit. Thanks!,btohqsg
This car is monitored by security camera … u go and check if u are in the view.,btohqsg
I think the key here is  did you file a report with your own insurer?,btohqsg
Even if you agree to pte settlement  also need to file a report with your own insurer.,btohqsg
Yes  my car workshop helped me to filed an insurance report. However they shared that if the other party do not file any police report  the other party insurer will not send a surveyor to survey the damages.Lesson learned to check in car camera periodically:(,btohqsg
