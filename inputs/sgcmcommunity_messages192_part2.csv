New car owner here  anyone can advise whether to do ceremic coat or PPF.I want to maintain the shine and minimise cleaning frequency,btohqsg
Ceramic coating will be cheaper but requires more maintenance  maybe re apply every 6 to 9 months,btohqsg
My current car has ceramic coating  water beading not super good  but decent. But after every wash  the shine is there. Coming to 9 months for my coating,btohqsg
Ppf can go up to 5k for some brands  but it can probably last 3-5 years. But I have heard of some films turning yellow. Don’t know true or not,btohqsg
Nowadays there is like gloss black or gloss white ppf and even matte already  so that’s like additional benefit of color change if that’s your thing,btohqsg
318 also can win hor hor,btohqsg
no la 318 so old  sure lose la,btohqsg
