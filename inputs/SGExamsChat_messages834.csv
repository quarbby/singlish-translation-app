oh trust me this is p common LOL,btohqsg
Is probably the same situation as the girl you mentioned to me abt,btohqsg
Yeah i have to kinda still filter in my brain its not an X its just your braket,btohqsg
what's this thing? looks like a giant whiteboard eraser.,btohqsg
Its a cane for misbehaving children,btohqsg
"But yea I have come to a conclusion that our batch is kinda...""lazy"" (this one is by graduated senior)",btohqsg
it's a bracket for the electronics bc that board is an interactive one,btohqsg
"Oh yea actually that is a ""smartboard""",btohqsg
lol she said hi to me outside spms once and i stared at her for like 10 seconds trying to rmb who she was,btohqsg
Hmmm Salary those middle aged (30++) one I assume can reach $5k to $10k.But I guess no combined income from being married  and can't BTO.,btohqsg
No  iestin. That is your friend.,btohqsg
just someone from the tutorial that idk the name of,btohqsg
Wait is the same one right? Or diff girl?,btohqsg
ahhh so it is something like a projector touch screen?,btohqsg
i think she's by right in iestin's tutorial? but that first session she joined monday,btohqsg
is she the one that took driving test recently,btohqsg
ok i know her name then,btohqsg
Meanwhile I gave up on driving,btohqsg
she's the one that emailed me with Dear sir,btohqsg
I dont know her name for a year,btohqsg
If i didnt know you i wouldve hit you with the dear sir too,btohqsg
"The ""r"" not supposed to be there but the ""yan"" supposed to be there",btohqsg
"I would be like ""dear TA""",btohqsg
students thinking it might a cross product. üòÇ,btohqsg
I havent seen a cross product as of recent so it wouldnt cross my mind xD,btohqsg
it saves 2 strokes for every outer product i write,btohqsg
Bruh i didnt bring my ipad home to study,btohqsg
Time to pen and paper this weekend,btohqsg
I never really follow. Semi retirement mood liao though I don't have enough to retire haha,btohqsg
hmmm. just curious in teaching. Doesn't NTU/NUS have those giant writing Windows tablets in lecture halls?,btohqsg
nevermind  can move to Malaysia  where currency now still $1 to RM3.3.,btohqsg
The anal mech hw is in paper and pen.,btohqsg
I do have a friend who's planning to retire in Malaysia. He and his wife already bought a house there,btohqsg
it started dropping from 3.46 on the exact day i went to KL lol,btohqsg
was 3.35 by the time i left,btohqsg
Did you not go to tutorial for ph2104 üòÇ,btohqsg
I dont think ive even opened the course in ntulearn yet,btohqsg
Like... he posted it a week ago,btohqsg
Bruh lemmi tell you half of my cohort doesnt know any of the prof names yet,btohqsg
Luckily it is due on 13 sep,btohqsg
No info about the homework is even posted,btohqsg
Thought alot of Junior Colleges / Singapore unis  like to use prepared lectured slides/word documents  use Windows Tablets open OneNote  and just draw on blank canvas/slides.,btohqsg
He said it in this wks lecture,btohqsg
We have profs who use their own rablet and write,btohqsg
ah atleast you experienced great exchange rate power of 3.35?  üòÇ,btohqsg
I using the lams version though its so much more understandable,btohqsg
But like it is projected on a screen rather than touch screen,btohqsg
just sad i didn't go a week earlier,btohqsg
Who tf set all the lectures at 9 am in the morning,btohqsg
I saw that and i was like nope,btohqsg
That lecture is literally my only lesson on monday,btohqsg
his coriolis force demo is sick,btohqsg
I aint going to school just for a 2 hour 9am lecture,btohqsg
I mean it was...in both ways,btohqsg
wait did he use the see saw this year,btohqsg
But erm...i dont like 1 of the volunteers,btohqsg
if Lectures are recorded  I won't attend 9am lecture unless attendance is compulsory.,btohqsg
HE DID NOT USE A SEE SAW,btohqsg
But guess what he managed to finish chp 4 in week 3 LMAO,btohqsg
lemme see if i can find a clip,btohqsg
it was also for coriolis force,btohqsg
I need to catch up 4 chapters in 3 weeks?,btohqsg
those are good  if they saved their writings into pdf and uploads them haha. otherwise. good luck haha,btohqsg
You have to catch up 5 chapters in 4 wks,btohqsg
And then we have the profs who actually write on a whiteboard,btohqsg
At least you did not take ph3102,btohqsg
better have a student silently video record the lecture then. üòÇ,btohqsg
Man was traumatised at my ph3102 hw,btohqsg
I DIDNT GET A SEE SAW,btohqsg
so there's a camera pointing up at the pivot,btohqsg
I GOT A VOLLEYBALL UH BUT NOT THE SEE SAW,btohqsg
then the two people throw the ball at each other,btohqsg
maybe this new way is just easier LOL,btohqsg
I think is a sign prof tim gonna be retiring sia,btohqsg
like how prof justin brought a bucket of water on a string and spun it around himself for mechanics,btohqsg
Who the hell can carry that much hahahaha,btohqsg
Oh..... for us is elbert chia,btohqsg
for me we had two separate classes for mechanics,btohqsg
do Lecturers need to write an application letter to office in bringing such contraption to lecture hall? lol,btohqsg
one has 1 hour less lecture per week for those that need more catching up in y1,btohqsg
prof justin took the faster class,btohqsg
or is already part of the planned syllabus?,btohqsg
Is like how i drank alcohol in front my professor for cc0001,btohqsg
It was a 8 min one,btohqsg
eh i'm sure the see saw needed some paperwork,btohqsg
i have seen masters classes in NUS use liquid nitrogen tho in a demo,btohqsg
still quite envy you still able to work in an Uni settings with exciting experiments. haha,btohqsg
because in Malaysia  from high school to uni. most of the time just study the theory  can't really see the actual phenomena happen in person.,btohqsg
yea experiments is all about funding,btohqsg
hello  does anybody know if doing further math mechanics questions(Old syllabus) helps prepare you for h2 physics mechanics as well?,btohqsg
for (ii)  why is it wrong to use AC = (1/2) AB approach,btohqsg
the ans key used this method,btohqsg
somehow i thought i stumbled onto another O/N levels academic chat,btohqsg
this proves i don't pay attention,btohqsg
Anyone want vip tix olivia rodrigo vip standing dm me,btohqsg
the physics concepts are the same  but the requirements are different,btohqsg
Ah  maybe for incline planes / Work Energy Power / Equilibrium questions.,btohqsg
i was replying to a bot saying someone got banned,btohqsg
A PhD student from Britain  who was in Singapore on a research attachment programme  died when he fell 3m from a fence in Pasir Panjang.According to a UK coroner‚Äôs inquest  Mr John William Richmond had consumed a large amount of alcohol the night before the incident on April 13  2023.https://str.sg/o4AFw,btohqsg

Is it better to take private uni directly or go through poly first?,btohqsg
I'm a bare pass grad from NUS High,btohqsg
why go through poly again? takes a long time,btohqsg
My mom seems to think I'd be better off in poly then local university over just private university (mostly because of networking and clubs),btohqsg
She's not wrong  tbh... I'm also probably past the point where overseas unis might take me (except maybe Japan/USA?),btohqsg
I'm not sure how Japan sees our local private unis though,btohqsg
but it takes 10 years for you to do that,btohqsg
nothing can be said w certainty if I can read the future I wldnt be studying,btohqsg
yes so there is no certainty which is better,btohqsg
doesn't mean u can't choose the path that'll have higher probability of bringing a btr future,btohqsg
Can I make up for the lack of networking in a private university?,btohqsg
some NUS i know also cannot get a job within one year,btohqsg
i can tell u if I'm in a private uni idt I'll have the business card of one of the director of Singapore's national accountancy certification board in my phone case rn,btohqsg
lidad private uni aso cannot get job within one year,btohqsg
u need compare same degree mah,btohqsg
I'm not too into accountancy anyway  or I'd just continue with ACCA all the way,btohqsg
Also  consider the overseas aspect. Japanese immigration REALLY requires a degree  it's a hard requirement,btohqsg
what do you mean by circumstance?,btohqsg
Or 10+ years of work experience,btohqsg
why nus degree cannot get job?,btohqsg
certain industries private uni but can smoke interview is gna be btr than big 3 cannot smoke interview,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the US or Europe though,btohqsg
I know Australia offers PR to cyber security professionals,btohqsg
and ISCA is also starting an office one floor above my school,btohqsg
But a) I'm considering moving to the US because I'll probably have family there too by the time I graduate (my Viet aunt and uncle plan to send their son to the US for high school) and b) I have no real reason to move to Australia over someplace like Japan or US,btohqsg
Maybe visit a few times  but not live there,btohqsg
I still don't get your point,btohqsg
So in that case  would a local private university  poly + local public uni or overseas uni (probably in Japan) be better?,btohqsg
US uni is out of my reach,btohqsg
they still have to join ISCA exams and training i think,btohqsg
you see whr u want to relocate to lor  see how recognised private degrees aresay for eg UK  local big 2 unis will be able to get work visa more easily,btohqsg
I'm mostly looking at JPN and USA,btohqsg
Japan honestly idk cause they hate foreigners,btohqsg
USA... generally hard to go thr as a foreigner unless you got a degree thr. even then it's v hard,btohqsg
I aso have to join isca exams and training,btohqsg
Does a local private university degree issued by a US university count?,btohqsg
or at least  I don't think so,btohqsg
NTU/NUS will probably still be better recognised than a US university unless it's ivy league,btohqsg
even NUS and NTU hard to get a place there,btohqsg
True  so most of my hopes will be on Japan,btohqsg
Partly because Tokyo-US flights are much cheaper than SG-US flights,btohqsg
Yeah  Zipair flies between Tokyo Narita and a few US cities on the West Coast,btohqsg
I mean ya I know that but,btohqsg
basing your decision on flight tix prices,btohqsg
Mostly because I don't like my chances in the other usual emigration destinations for Singaporeans,btohqsg
"they're the ""usual"" destinations for a reason",btohqsg
AUS is having an insane COL crisis (heard it from my Aussie friends)  I suck at non-English Euro languages  USA... You know.,btohqsg
everywhere is having an insane COL crisis,btohqsg
Much worse in AUS for a  honestly  mid  lifestyle,btohqsg
Is it worth taking UK A-Levels to get into their unis?,btohqsg
you either have high salary high COL  low(er) salary lower COL  or high salary low COL but u spend time and money travelling between cities everyday,btohqsg
u cld  if you're confident u can do well ,btohqsg
uk a levels is singapore o lvl standard,btohqsg
Honestly speaking having NUS and NTU are better if you come to Japan and work,btohqsg
Like they will recognize the big three more often than not,btohqsg
And your COE will have a way higher chance of not rejected than having a private university degree,btohqsg
Between potentially 7 years  with not a guaranteed chance at the big 3 unis  and just getting a degree over there  which would be better?,btohqsg
This one depends on you liao,btohqsg
poly students i know 20% SIT 80% SIM,btohqsg
That's why I think I like my chances at a JP uni better,btohqsg
Realistically  working in Japan isn't really that good because of the low salary and language barrier,btohqsg
The ones that pay very well are usually your IT jobs  and even IT jobs have its own tier levels,btohqsg
The average annual salary in Tokyo here is around like 5 to 6m annually after including the bonus and minashi zangyo,btohqsg
And as a fresh grad finding jobs in Japan  depending on your jobs you probably will get at most 4m annually,btohqsg
Not to mention you have to pay for your student loans as well,btohqsg
My time when I moved there is higher because the exchange rate is 1:80,btohqsg
Cost of living actually not that bad,btohqsg
My rent is like 25k yen per month,btohqsg
hi anyone knows where to get simoc past paper?,btohqsg
Transport is like provided by the company,btohqsg
At least to and fro my company,btohqsg
The rest are personal expenses and they aren't that bad provided you don't go to maid cafe everyday for every meal,btohqsg
Like probably you can find food for around 800 yen per meal,btohqsg
Actually doesn't sound too bad even with Tokyo COL,btohqsg
better food than here but cheaper ?,btohqsg
Like you could potentially earn way more in Singapore,btohqsg
Not to mention you have to figure out living on your own in Japan,btohqsg
Actually yes? Even the touristy places are cheaper than the equivalent level of quality would be here,btohqsg
Tbh  when I am in Japan  I kind of appreciate hawker food even more,btohqsg
Cheaper and nicer for my taste buds,btohqsg
A lot of options as well,btohqsg
Like you can find something that's nice  affordable,btohqsg
but hawker food price have rised to 400yen and probably will still rise,btohqsg
Something decent here and cheap is usually on the average of 800 yen,btohqsg
and some hawker centres getting replaced by shopping malls ü•¥,btohqsg
I find local portion sizing to be quite small for me at the 4 SGD price point,btohqsg
To be fair Japan portion sizing can also be quite small,btohqsg
3.5K SGD sounds a bit high for a private university cybersec grad  tbh,btohqsg
Well if you are in Japan  you have to rent an apartment,btohqsg
Sharehouse is the cheaper option but the rooms is very small,btohqsg
Apartment you will need a Japanese guarantor plus Japanese don't really like to rent apartments to foreigners,btohqsg
Could accept that  but I doubt I have a future here,btohqsg
Hi! I just applied to DukeNUS medical school. I hope to exchange useful information here!,btohqsg
Maybe the future might have better in store for me  but I don't hold much hope,btohqsg

If you dont go uni with a A level cert  then you are someone with no trade skills,btohqsg
compared to a diploma with likely some form of trade skill,btohqsg
but he definitely wants NUS/NTU which is difficult for poly students,btohqsg
tbh  even if you drop out of A levels  at least you tried i guess,btohqsg
he is frm nus high sch,btohqsg
Anyone from poly who done well enough to enter probably won't die too horribly,btohqsg
at least the academic rigour isn‚Äôt that much compared to jc like u study for the content needed fr the course,btohqsg
only a few and no one i know has done so,btohqsg
If you can qualify for local u  why not,btohqsg
last i been there was 14 yrs ago,btohqsg
i just went HK last year,btohqsg

issokay the singapore sea vv big,btohqsg
hello  have never chatted here before but how does one get out of a very severe rut. talking about possibly future ending type rut,btohqsg
probably need to rethink what you are doing  given that you are asking for advice from strangers on an online platformon top of not even having provided any further details.,btohqsg
well tldr   i am currently taking a break from my studies after a semester in poly bc of a lot of issues working with people and self-doubts which resulted in me stoning for the majority of the days. This break was supposed to help me get back on my feet and in this break i‚Äôve decided that I want to trf to JC. however  I have been doing nothing to improve this situation for one entire month. I am aware that I don‚Äôt want to continue living like this bc it might really result in a bleak future. I used to be a very disciplined student  and have never been in such a long rut before. hence want to ask how other students got out of something like this.,btohqsg
if eae reject will they give u a rejection email ?,btohqsg
also anyone did eae did they release the results on the same day or it‚Äôs spread over the few days,btohqsg
Good luck guysYear 3 Poly EAE student,btohqsg
Tbh it took me dropping to my lowest to get out of it,btohqsg
I didn't have any motivation for o levels so I went to ite,btohqsg
And I found my motivation there,btohqsg
"it did happen to me in S3/S4.I only ""woke up"" later part of J1.You just have to consciously work on it. Things like looking into the mirror and telling yourself to buck up works (a kind of self NLP).Outside help can only go so far. A lot of it is still within yourself.Some other things that could help would probably include:1) Set goals. Track the progress. Progress  no matter how fast or slow  is still a cause for celebration and adds to motivation. Reward yourself a little when you achieve a goal.2) Set timelines / deadlines. Each work needs to be completed  no delay no procrastination. Easier said than done definitely. But it has to be done.",btohqsg
These skills apply after graduation as well.Things like financial  work - related  family related  etc.,btohqsg
thanks for this. will work on tracking my progress bit by bit,btohqsg
But I have a crush on my friend and they asked if I liked them,btohqsg
I'm worried about jeopardising our relationship,btohqsg
Depends kidIf you know that saying yes might jeopadise the friendship and you dont wanna lose the friendship  then suffer in silenceOtherwise  could say yes and see how it goes but i recommend trying to understand if she actually does like you back (etc asking her friends or your friends if theyve seen any obvious signs),btohqsg
I told her that we are going to shelf that conversation for later,btohqsg
The two of us are fairly close,btohqsg
We have been on several solo stuff together without our friend group,btohqsg
I think it really boils down to one questionIf saying yes might risk the relationship  would you still want to do it,btohqsg
"Lestin inserted the L cus the L stands for ""Love expert""",btohqsg
Lestin may not have a PhD in Physics but he sure has a PhD in Love Counselling,btohqsg
Like she would prefer later kind?,btohqsg
Does she like pickles or clams?,btohqsg
If she likes pickles or is ok with either then yes,btohqsg
Wait till you find out im at week 0 for 3 of my mods,btohqsg
Welp I am at week -24,btohqsg
And I didn't attend 80% of my scheduled classes,btohqsg
I am dying in vector calc and linear algebra,btohqsg
I am dying just tryna to add drop,btohqsg
your eigenvector = (0 0 0),btohqsg
He knows I put a zero vector in the quiz hahahah,btohqsg
i'm really seeing all sorts of things when marking,btohqsg
I have no idea what any of dis fucking means,btohqsg
tbh this kinda gives her an answer in itself,btohqsg
Ok luh but at least iestin did get the eigenvectors,btohqsg
Sometimes the best answer is leaving it unanswered,btohqsg
got some people managed to get eigenvalues with 0 working,btohqsg
Who's eigen and why is he with vector,btohqsg
Ok tbh i dont even know whether gc can do that,btohqsg
Iam not even there yet to die...,btohqsg
who's para and why is he with bola,btohqsg
might be possible but that's why i need to check with them lol,btohqsg
I just finished si yan's quiz and then called it a good semester,btohqsg
U can always stay for another .5 years,btohqsg
might have to be more explicit on what we wanna see working wise going forward,btohqsg
In my mind I suspect is the A=U^-1AU  thing,btohqsg
I cant rlly thing of any other working,btohqsg
maybe it's a property of a symmetric matrix i didn't know about,btohqsg
bc all the problems were like that,btohqsg
but yea that's why we're gonna ask them about it lor,btohqsg
i timed myself and i can do those in 30 seconds each,btohqsg
Is there a shortcut I dont know lmai,btohqsg
not really. it's just recognising quickly what you wanna make the subject for your system of linear equations,btohqsg
Ouhh wait i realised u meant,btohqsg
but if the gc can solve eigenvalues in some way and completely bypass the characteristic equation  then it kinda gives too much of an advantage. i'd maybe at least want them to write things down,btohqsg
not just one line then answer,btohqsg
if it's some math thing then that's fine bc you benefit from knowing more,btohqsg
Honestly I think everyone would have given up using the brain for eigenvectors to using gc üòÇ,btohqsg
But i feel like eigenvalues itself tho...,btohqsg
I cant rlly process what they would do,btohqsg
ok but keep in mind that midterms and finals is up to prof chew to decide what he wants to see. we'll make it more clear in an announcement,btohqsg
like maybe gc allowed but must write shit out properly,btohqsg
Oh yea Imayyynot come in wk 5...,btohqsg
As in the tutorial  not the lecture üòÇ,btohqsg
no i think she wants to wait a while,btohqsg
Then u tryna preorder or what sia,btohqsg
so i assume she expects an answer,btohqsg
Not responding to that is also an answer,btohqsg
"i think ""we are going to shelf this"" is basically an yes",btohqsg
she asked me after a run,btohqsg
Honestly if i were in sec school in your position I would just wait until like after poly also,btohqsg
Yea but like in honest truth I have heard of many stories about breakups in NS...,btohqsg
this will be stereotypical and cliche,btohqsg
but she is not like that,btohqsg
Especially if the woman go to Uni,btohqsg
she is not like other girls,btohqsg
Honestly if you are very very confident that you would care for her  I would say yes uh,btohqsg
i care a lot about her yes,btohqsg
for me i'd shoot my shot be it now then talk about it or after poly,btohqsg
but it's up to you to weigh,btohqsg
Regardless man or woman  commitment is quite impt,btohqsg
You still have other things to settle also,btohqsg
i just think it'll feel kinda sad if she ends up getting attached in the future and you didn't try,btohqsg
my plan is to tell her how i feel,btohqsg
and tell her that we will decide after poly,btohqsg
because i also want to focus on my internship,btohqsg
better to put all our cards on the table now,btohqsg
Does she know that you know she knows?,btohqsg
btw regarding the breakups in NS thing  it's not rlly about what she's like as a person. it's just a level of uncertainty that fr neither you nor her can predict,btohqsg
she knows i know she knows,btohqsg
but statistically that's what it is,btohqsg
plus she asked me if i liked her,btohqsg
Then do u know that she knows that you know that she knows?,btohqsg
we can meet once a week,btohqsg
In hall ppl meet daily mutiple times,btohqsg
Like u just cannot hit that level when in NS,btohqsg
nothing wrong with trying but it's smth to keep in mind,btohqsg
Yea plus NS is strenuously tiring,btohqsg
it's extremely easy to assume things will last lol,btohqsg
So now that she knows do other people also know that she knows and does she know that other people know that she knows?,btohqsg
they said i was very obvious,btohqsg
Then what u waiting for ah,btohqsg
The sky to turn red isit,btohqsg
but there's a reason statistically relationships that start pre-uni often don't last,btohqsg
Actually i think at this rate can confess uh,btohqsg
esp for those in their first,btohqsg
but in your case i mean,btohqsg
the scene has alr been set for you to go with your plan lol,btohqsg
im worried she does not feel that way,btohqsg
I text you the wooclap pw,btohqsg
If she was she would have subtly hinted,btohqsg
she alr ask  you alr gave a half yes,btohqsg
she knows i like her and didnt tell me to fuck off,btohqsg
so that is a good sign,btohqsg
just have the convo later on then,btohqsg

hihi I'm a sec 2 and currently in my streaming year and im not sure if i should follow my interest of taking pure hist or take pure geog since i have better grades (a1/a2),btohqsg
hallo  ultimately  it depends on your interest and not solely on results. if you have interest for the subj  you‚Äôll genuinely do btr in it than a subj whr u scored well at. pure hist and pure geog is very different from sec1 and 2 hist and geog though there are similarities. ultimately you shd consider ur interest and your results but i think interest is more important compared to results imo,btohqsg
ultimately its ur choice so choose wisely bcs it also affects ur olvls,btohqsg
hi guys those in jc can i ask when ur prelims end ?,btohqsg
mine end the week school opens then like lowkey seems kinda fast,btohqsg
did u take pure hist? can you tell me what its like?,btohqsg
but i took elect hist and its fun to learn,btohqsg
Lower sec u can anyhow wack,btohqsg
Finding the inference/message is much tricker,btohqsg
Lower sec pretty much accept anything,btohqsg
hi i took pure hist and elect geog so i can tell u how pure hist is like,btohqsg
i find pure hist manageable due to my sch history notes and mindmap. sbq is easy to score if u get the answering technique and inference right. essay writing is important as it accounts for 8m or 12m.,btohqsg
for pure hist  we learn about ww1  ww2 ( europe)  how hitler rise to power  hitler‚Äôs personality  how japan‚Äôs colonisation of power rise  reasons of ww2 ( japan)  how ww2 ended for both japan and germany  south korean war & vietnam war,btohqsg

in what aspect (of the trade industry)? generally speaking or do you have a clear idea of what you're trying to ask because there are A LOT of industries that have connections to trade  it just depends on how one perceives the importance of itin fact  i think there are all sorts of local companies doing international trade-- their success or profitability is another thing,btohqsg
