DBS Group Research30 Oct 20243Q24 missed expectations due to weak demand from key customerDisappointing 3Q24  due to weak demand from key customer. Aztech reported a 41.2% plunge in 3Q24 revenue to SGD166.7mn while net profit tumbled 55.7% y/y to SGD13.7mn  despite a seasonally strong quarter. On a q/q basis  revenue and net profit were down 31.8% and 55.5% respectively. The decline in net profit was due to lower revenue  higher depreciation and net foreign exchange loss  partly offset by higher interest income and lower tax expense. The lower demand was mainly from its key customer  which accounts for c.80% of the total revenue.For the 9-mth period  net profit declined 18.2% y/y to SGD60.4mn  on the back of a 19.7% decline in revenue to SGD539.9m. 9M24 revenue accounted for 58% of our forecast while net profit only made up 52%  way below our and consensus expectations. 3Q24 net margin of 8.2% was among the lowest since listing in 2021. 9M24 net margin came in at 11.2%.Strong net cash position. Despite the weak results  the group continued to generate strong net cash from operating activities with improved working capital. Net cash from operating activities increased by 83.1% y/y to SGD89.9mn for 9M24. Net cash position increased by 25.2% y/y to SGD269.8mn as at 30 Sep 24.Expanding new product initiatives  exploring M&A opportunities. Aztech has expanded its new production introduction (NPI) portfolio with a total of 10 new products in the communication  consumer  health-tech and industrial segments  some of which are scheduled for commercial production from 4Q24. It will also increase and diversify its customer base  including exploring M&A opportunities to expand its business.Weakening order momentum. As of 1 October 2024  the group secured an order book totalling SGD142mn (vs SGD304mn as at 30 July 2024). Majority of the orders are scheduled for completion in FY24. With the lower order book  the group expects a slower 4Q24.Cut revenue and net profit on weaker outlook  downgrade to FULLY VALUED. We have reduced our revenue projections for FY24F/25F by 31%/38%. With a lower revenue projection  net margins would also be affected due lower operating leverage. Hence  we have reduced net margin assumption to 7.8%/8.2% for FY24F/25F  vs 12.6% previously. Accordingly  net profit was slashed by 41%/61%. On the back of the lower earnings projection  our TP is reduced to SGD0.63(previously SGD1.27)  pegged to 10x PE  its 4-year average  and rolled forward to FY25F earnings. Given theweaker outlook  we have cut our rating to FULLY VALUED from BUY. This set of weak results is expected to put downward pressure on its share price.,btohqsg
