Anyone thinks COE will drop even further for the next round of bidding? - J,btohqsg
u can change play list without touch screen?,btohqsg
orrrrr can use ur phone control the spotify,btohqsg
Yeah cause android based with eSim right,btohqsg
Well you can't exactly do that without carplay on the move either on native infotainment,btohqsg
my now one also update the moment u connect to a phone with wifi,btohqsg
Mine needs me to press 8 to 10 times to connect my phone with Bluetooth,btohqsg
Oh? I always assumed its identical,btohqsg
Yeah what exactly do you mean?,btohqsg
Similar functionality but layout is different,btohqsg
I haven't used android auto as extensively though,btohqsg
My vehicle doesn't have android auto,btohqsg
Like pressing up down enter cancel button,btohqsg
I've used carplay with others  seems pretty good,btohqsg
U cant toggle thru to the playlist  then choose the playlist via the buttons on steering wheel and then enter and play,btohqsg
You can do that if you have the Merc toggles as it has the blackberry scroll pads on the wheel,btohqsg
But that's just a way additional to touchscreen,btohqsg
Bmw has the scroll wheel and pad apart from touchscreen for the same,btohqsg
Yep.. so far only merz n bmw can. Other cars i seen/tried all cant. Have to do it on touchscreen and cant do on the go,btohqsg
Heâ€™s got a 370Z  M3 anddonâ€™t know what else to buy,btohqsg
Sometimes the song sian alrdy need change playlist hahaha,btohqsg
Yes but for max 2 months before it takes another giant leap,btohqsg
Oh  that's based on interaction methods for the infotainment systems. But for other cars the screen is closer to the driver and/or angled to them so you can use that,btohqsg
Or just hey Siri on carplay,btohqsg
But touch is not that much harder either,btohqsg
give you an inch... you want a yard,btohqsg
If you do it a few times  become muscle memory already,btohqsg
Like my 9 taps go connect Bluetooth,btohqsg
Aim for the moon so atleast youâ€™ll fall on the clouds,btohqsg
Not really for my potato car. Always a scretch to reach and press it,btohqsg
It's gonna stick around like this for a while :(,btohqsg
No need to skip or worry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ah i see. I haven't used apple for 10 years  no chance to try,btohqsg
But generally i feel android auto is not stable. But i use an aftermarket headunit,btohqsg
Yes this is the best  attention should be on the roads,btohqsg
yes voice control is the best,btohqsg
volvo voice control damn good imo,btohqsg
when you wanna call someone they can pick up the name of the person,btohqsg
Does it adapt to the singaporean slang,btohqsg
which is damn cool to me haha,btohqsg
thats why i think its damn good,btohqsg
Now my aftermarket headunit its worse,btohqsg
aiya you no need one la,btohqsg
Depends on the head unit and connection,btohqsg
Is there still.m135i offered? I thought all became 140i,btohqsg
