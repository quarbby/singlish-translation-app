I think we should reduce those,btohqsg
As for the part about gg to Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³  Myanmar  Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.... then just go lor....if they feel pain there then maybe they willCome back,btohqsg
Anyway no Matter what  they must look at Singaporeans first and make sure that the Singaporean with comparable skills should not lose to an FT in terms of pay.... end of day  sporeans are here to stay,btohqsg
That time you go and disturb people before 7 am I don't want to reply.,btohqsg
What does this mean? Are they saying that certain people get the results before hand?,btohqsg
The people who count at the counting site will get the data from the counting site so they can report for the total to be calculated. The parties have at least 1 rep at each. Each counting site gets ballots from a group of polling sites  which is from a area of blocks and other housing. So parties will know how they did across a few dozen blocks  but nothing narrower than that,btohqsg
So far nobody from any party knocked on my door yet... ðŸ˜‚ maybe they feel the result already obvious.,btohqsg
Only downstairs car park some loud speaker truck repeating the party slogans,btohqsg
No that's just 100 per site,btohqsg
You mean all WP also lies. They become PAP lite,btohqsg
So what the point of voting PAP lite.,btohqsg
Instead of saying everything that isn't exactly what you think is correct is a lie  maybe appreciate nuance. Is 10 million or 6.9 in 2030 plan a lie to you?,btohqsg
Don't know it is true or not  cannot prove or confirm what he say.,btohqsg
To prevent a supermajority where they can change the constitution. And I thought you previously said you support WP?,btohqsg
I support them   but you say they lies.,btohqsg
Yes they have no target  but it's great that the test balloons got shot down,btohqsg
They did not say anything  it is the past Ex-HDB chief say one.,btohqsg
If u cite someone  u are considering the credibility or possibility,btohqsg
Not just ex hdb chief but also existing hdb chief dr cheong koon hean. That's why its understandable people themselves are confused,btohqsg
Then they should come out and say those are only the personal views and not the national views,btohqsg
But it was mentioned that the clarification already said in parliament earlier this year,btohqsg
They said those things not in private but in offical roles with the media reporting them saying as such,btohqsg
And ho ching herself shared those views by Liu thai kher,btohqsg
Ho ching is not even a politician.,btohqsg
She even share Taiwan and US.,btohqsg
Are you suffering with no food?,btohqsg
Real suffering is no food  no job and home.,btohqsg
Don't let people find out  you suffering  still can travel overseas.,btohqsg
You go india and other poor countries  you will know true suffering.,btohqsg
You vote in people like Trump  Mahathir and western politician. you will really let your future children suffer.,btohqsg
Their own government is because they vote in the wrong government  you want to follow their footstep.,btohqsg
At least way better than Trump and Mahathir.,btohqsg
We got no other resources to exploit other than manpower,btohqsg
Until you lose the good government  it will be too late. Like US,btohqsg
Another way of saying is if we don't exploit people  we cannot survive??,btohqsg
No one is expecting to change government completely. That's fear mongering tactics the PAP is making citizens afraid of saying that.Instead opposition is needed to keep PAP in check,btohqsg
Morning guys  anyone has friends with big dogs at least 20kg and below age of 6? Earl Grey suddenly has an unknown condition and needs to do blood transfusion. She wouldn't be able to make it otherwise. Please help me share the plea. Apologies desperate for dog owners to step up so sharing here,btohqsg
George Yeo is one example  This is not fear mongering,btohqsg
Lol. Political talks can go out of hand easily.Chill peeps.,btohqsg
It's very difficult to let people understand how gov works until one has lived in other countries,btohqsg
Then one will realise how good or bad his or her own country really is,btohqsg
I don't live in other countries  seeing other countries video will know. Hong Kong and US can see so clearly.,btohqsg
Not everyone thinks as openly as u do bro,btohqsg
The depth of the well differs from one frog to another. If u know what I mean,btohqsg
Hong Kong protest for 1 year  still protesting. I will never live there.,btohqsg
That's why it's very hard to change how one thinks,btohqsg
Until China take over  may consider.,btohqsg
If you vote for WP  why do you feel sad about him? Did you even vote for WP or not?If HSK loses  it's PAPs fault for not keeping him in Tampines. Want to take risks have to accept the consequences,btohqsg
Lol. I have lived in a European country and can tell you how they care for and put their citizens first at all cost,btohqsg
Like I say  it differs from one to another on the definition of care,btohqsg
