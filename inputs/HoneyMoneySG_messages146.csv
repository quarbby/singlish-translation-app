Nowadays churning don't benefit as much as using the card already  especially for Citibank  with CRMC + Amaze combo.,btohqsg
Can get $370 cashback for $500 purchase,btohqsg
While others probably on business class...,btohqsg
Hmm  getting abit side tracked already. I think i'll just apply and see if it still works  as my main card already hit the requirements,btohqsg
Hi all  for SEP is it better to do VC3A or VCMA for tax relief? Little monies in CPF now so no issues on anything being maxed out üòÖ,btohqsg
IMO  depends if you need monies in OA to pay for HDB loan. Both tax relief caps are different anyway.,btohqsg

nope. need to use directly when taking public transport,btohqsg
do you know any CC that earn miles for topping up? or top up dont earn any,btohqsg
Usually top up with wallet excluded from earning rewards for credit card,btohqsg
They dont fulfill 30k annual income requirement  need to do secured credit card subject to bank approval at branch,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I will be residing in Taiwan coming Jan 2025 for around 3 months  which overseas credit card/card should I use for my 3 month expenses  You trip or Trust? I also have citi premier miles,btohqsg
Guarantor is tricky haha  750k also bravo. 15k annual income still still subject to bank approval.My dad is 74 have dbs live fresh  that day report loss dbs dont even send replacement card,btohqsg
Easiest way still to go secured cc way with fd with bank loh. But really depend on their spending habit.,btohqsg

Talking about this‚Ä¶I was unable to collect my NTB bonus because I never activate my physical card.I link the card to my Apple Pay and just swipe the required amount and keep the card cold storage.In the end  I never get the bonus because the cso tell me I never activate the physical card lol.Please don‚Äôt commit the same mistake as me üò¢,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs why I felt it became more dangerous@MelvynEzi,btohqsg
The problem is there's no OTP on first login. Financial related apps should always have OTP on first login.,btohqsg
Probably they dk how to handle logins that go through a SSO like google,btohqsg
Someone said it prompts for OTP when login on new device but I cannot confirm as I didn‚Äôt try.,btohqsg
Go under payments > bank recipientNo fee for me for SGD  own name ac,btohqsg
I suggested 12 hour cool down when change new device to amaze customer support team.,btohqsg
That's unfortunate  additionally you are not NTB anymore also.Usually they got put a clause if need to activate physical card or not. If they didn't can appeal  if they did  then is your fault for not following terms.,btohqsg
Thanks. And first top up using card won‚Äôt incur fees right? Do you know the limit for that top up?,btohqsg
Cannot be just on new device  must be on new install  whether same device or not. And best if double OTP  one from SMS (very insecure) and one from email.If they want to go single OTP  then must force to use TOTP authenticator kind. But Singaporeans being Singaporeans  unlikely to want such change.,btohqsg
"There are some related discussions you can find by searching ""Taiwan card"" here.",btohqsg
Think safer to read thru based on Ur tierhttps://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/standard-fees/Seems like there was a change in July n free transfer are now limited to 5 per mth,btohqsg

I don't think above 65 can apply new credit card. They only can maintain their card. Meaning if they already cancelled their card. They will be no longer able to apply new one.,btohqsg
Yes. 55 still can apply but 65 no longer able to do so even if secured credit card. Previously try to do a secured cc for my parents. But dbs cso stated above,btohqsg
Upper limit of DBS secured credit card is 75  as stipulated on DBS website. So clearly someone gave you wrong info.DBS unsecured credit card with MAS stipulated criteria met is 70.,btohqsg
Because 70 is upper limit for unsecured CC and 75 is upper limit for secured CC. For DBS  others may vary.,btohqsg

Ega only 1% Cashback on giro n bonus promo 4% only 2 month and can't participate on the next promo. So what is the interest rate in the EGA acc  0.5%?,btohqsg
Depends on your strategy. What type rewards do you want  can you meet the min spend on the card  etc. Then decide whether you should use card with CardUp or just eGIRO to HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
I find that ega Abit troublesome. Have use giro form to mail n wait . Later nerf again,btohqsg
Definitely eventually will be GIRO to HSBC EGA.But if he doesn't want to earn miles or can't meet min spend for the eligible cashback cards  would be best to eGIRO to HSBC EGA directly.,btohqsg
Egiro can ? I thought must use form to mail. If not considered not eligible under t & c.,btohqsg
Are you mixing up the 2 programmes?HSBC Everyday+ Rewards: 1% Cashback on GIRO and 1% p.a. bonus interest on incremental MAB is 1 month. Can register monthly  but NEED incremental MAB for following month.HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo: 3% (Dec 24 promo) p.a. bonus interest on incremental MAB is 2 months. Can register based on your last registration month. 2nd month also earns the bonus interest without additional increment.,btohqsg
Oh thanks  egiro can use on HSBC,btohqsg
eGIRO is not self-initiated bank transfer via GIRO.,btohqsg

Cardup will be different mcc but the recent mastercard promo by cardup might not get card reward according to milelion,btohqsg

Hi  I want to buy a $1100 laptop from Harvey Norman. Not sure if I can split payments there but the plan is that. Currently have the CRMC + Amaze combo only and using it to cover $900-$1000 of the cost of the laptop. However  I need another card to cover the remainder cost of the laptop and also a card that has no min. spend as I probably only going to spend $300-$400 before the end of the statement month of my CRMC resets back to $0. Any suggestions on what I should get? Can also serve as a backup card moving forward in the case I spend more than $1000 in certain months. Prefer miles but I don‚Äôt mind cashback too. Any help would be greatly appreciated üôè,btohqsg

Sorry if this as been asked beforeFor optimising max personal CPF tax relief of $37740 for an SEP... is the best option to add VCMA/VC3A $29740  then RSTU $8000?Or is the $37740 cap only for VCMA/VC3A... with a separate tax relief category for RSTU $8k?,btohqsg
VCMA and RSTU different tax relief cap from VC3A.,btohqsg
U can try ask can partial payment then remaining pay liao the collect item haha,btohqsg
so VC3A tax relief cap is $37740?and RSTU+VCMA tax relief cap is $8k?which category does mandatory MA contribution fall into?,btohqsg
Same as VC3A. Under annual tax relief cap. Don't forget the tax relief cap from 37% of assessable income as well.,btohqsg
So an example to max out CPF tax relief for an SEP (assuming no option for spouse/parental top ups) is- Mandatory MA contribution + VC3A to hit $37740- RSTU+VCMA to hit $8000?,btohqsg
Hi  sifu. Is it good to link YouTrip linked to amaze crmc combo or direct crmc instead or POSB everyday card?,btohqsg
never had any experience splitting payments before,btohqsg
you referring to topup youtrip? topup using any mastercard credit card directly  all no rewards anyway,btohqsg
Noticed the BHS increased in 2023 was 3.8%  2024 was 4.3% vs 5.6%  in 2025. In other words ppl who already max out the BHS will also come a point their VCMA top up in Jan can reach 8k 1 day. Not sure if that is good or bad news‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes  eventually have to trend with medical cost inflation,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm researching on using iPayMy to pay Property Tax  and according to the iPayMy website:https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/3153490-which-cards-can-earn-rewards-with-ipaymyThere are quite a number of cards that can earn cashback.However  I see that I can't input an Amex Credit Card into iPayMy (so the Amex True Cashback does not seem to be supported).When checking for UOB PRVI Miles VISA  the UOB T&Cs also say that iPayMy is excluded:https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/terms-and-conditions-governing-uob-prvi-miles-card.pdfDoes anyone have any recommendations on what is the best card to use for iPayMy?

Anyone know how to claim the transportation discount/rebate starting from Jan 2025? Seems confusing,btohqsg
If they is any starting in end Jan  they probably will take reference from Dec. it is too late,btohqsg
Should be month of Dec if the promotion happens at end-Dec. Based on similar promotions by UOB. I guess it depends when the promotion starts  it will take reference starting 2 months back,btohqsg
Most likely in Jan  if any. Best time to wipe is on 30 Nov.,btohqsg
Hi  does transaction via NETS using credit card counted towards the minimum spending?,btohqsg

any idea when is the next promo? so I need to clear to 1K one month earlier,btohqsg
U have to wait for next next quarter liao bah with reference month as mar 25 if there is one.,btohqsg
Lock on UOB TMRW. But it means you need to draw the locked amount physically from ATM as a security measure.Not the same as earmarking  earmarking means you can't touch the money without requesting UOB staff to pull you out of the promo early  their mechanism for earmarking is intended for promo and not security.,btohqsg

hi guys  i think this may be a question that's been answered before but wanted to seek advice from the community.Tax reliefs - should I be looking at voluntary CPF contribution or SRS first?Factors I'm considering:1. withdrawal age2. longer runway for investing due to age3. potential returns from the followingthanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi  need some advise here. I participated the DBS Altitude FCY spend campaign for 5mpd. Today I check the tracker has clocked $993 out of the spend goal of $1000  but I already back to SG.  Any suggestion how can I clock the remaining $7 FCY in SG to fulfil the spend goal?,btohqsg
The min spend 1k doesn‚Äôt have to be all FCY.,btohqsg
For 10k miles is not cheap  even worse after KF costs increase,btohqsg
This really depends on individuals. Like your tax bracket  age  house ownership  intention of staying in Singapore only etc,btohqsg
Not sure if this helps but for some context - 27yo Singaporean  no property but probably looking into one in coming years  tax bracket depends since there's substantial variable income. tax bracket possibly looking at around 100k or moreI've been researching on CPF FRS but don't seem to get the appeal for now  I'm familiar with the SRS scheme but 63 years old to withdraw seems like a long time for me üòÖ,btohqsg
Tracker includes local and FX  any MCC as long not excluded in T&C  eg. insurance.,btohqsg
Noob SRS invester here - should I invest via DBS or SYFE? How does linking my SRS to syfe even work? Given the super long term commitment I'm not comfortable with parking my money into syfe for so many years but their investment options seem more lucrative,btohqsg

Hi guys  for Kris+ app  the miles from payments made with Kris Pay and redeeming of miles from like banks etc  will all be reflected in the app  is that correct?,btohqsg
Good afternoon gurus  would like to seek advice on how to calculate the miles I am getting. I used to charge to the uob kf card but realised I should have clock it to my newly acquired uob ppv card. However  I am not sure how do I check if miles or points were awarded for the transactions. Anyone could advise please?,btohqsg
UOB PPV  check in UOB Tmrw app after transaction is posted  10 UNI$ per $5. Must be mobile contactless or whitelisted online.,btohqsg
With the options you have from SYFE  you might be better off investing iShares US Index Fund (IE) S&P 500 in Endowus. With lesser overall fees.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfqPsoyj2ANot financial advice.,btohqsg
For interbank giro. The transaction will take place one day before the due date?,btohqsg
Depends. Which bank to which bank?,btohqsg
Any1 know where i can find compilation of mcc?,btohqsg
Usually. Sometimes on the day itself.,btohqsg
Do note it might not be 100% accurate. Just a guideline.,btohqsg
If it nv happens after 6pm. I should do it manual?,btohqsg
Please do. Better be safe than get charged w interest and late fee.,btohqsg
Does it specifically state GIRO payment on the statement in the first place? If it doesn't  just make the manual payment.,btohqsg
The giro approve after the statement date.Mean most probably won‚Äôt happen this month?Anyway the due date is on the 27th. As long as I monitor and pay it on 27th. Should be fine right?Maybe I will just take it as long no deduction after 5pm  I do it manually.,btohqsg
The GIRO approved after statement date then only the next statement will start. But check to be sure.Suggest to pay on 26th  just in case.,btohqsg
Cool. Thanksss I will follow up till 26th and manual it if it din happen.,btohqsg
Printed on last page of the statement.,btohqsg

hi credit card shifus  any recommendation for credit card (miles) if monthly spend around $20kthanks,btohqsg
All retail  dining and shopping spends or inclusive of loans  utilities etc?,btohqsg
for shopping and dining and retail,btohqsg
Bro  I think you will need all the usual 4mpd cards and still have left over to absorb.Here are some ways to exhaust it1. DBS Women $1 5002. Amaze + CRMC $1 0003. UOB Lady‚Äôs $2 0004. UOB PPV $1 1105. UOB VS $2 000Remainder: Uncapped UOB KrisFlyer $12 3903mpd on selected categories. Use the above to catch all first as this card has some caveats. You‚Äôll need to spend $800 for the 3mpd on select categories.Your breakdown on the actual expenses you‚Äôll have to do yourself and see if the cards above make sense.,btohqsg
Can you recommend a credit card for managing high-ticket purchases  typically around $7 000 to $8 000 per month?Additionally  how flexible are retail stores when it comes to splitting payments into smaller transactions? (never tried it before),btohqsg
I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm lazy haha. If I need to swipe these amounts I‚Äôll use Vantage or Maybank VI whose annual fees can be waived with $60k spending a year and absorb it.Vantage gives free hotel stays and discounts at Accor hotel buffets and Maybank VI allows you to get points for insurance and education.,btohqsg
Want high reward typically need multiple card. Or else can only be those general spending card.,btohqsg
Retail stores then have to ask them.. 7-8k you can consider uob privi as it can meet the 50k spent for additional 20k miles.,btohqsg
Hi all  just to seek some advice here. I have never looked into CPF and tax relief before but now I did a little research and would like some advice.Info: 30MCpf balances: OA:92k SA:29k MA: 35kSingle  not planning to get married or buy house  current hdb is fully paid1. Should I do cpf topup to qualify for the 8k tax relief? If so  shld i do vcma or rstu? Im in the 40-80k tax bracket (7%). Alr topup $600 to my mum earlier this year for the MRSS scheme. So I can top up another $7 400. Personally  I feel that vcma is better? This is to hit BHS earlier and supercharge SA.2. Should I transfer my OA balances to SA? Since im not planning to buy a house  the SA 4% interest is much better than the OA 2.5% interest. The transfer from OA to SA also help me to bit FRS faster.Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember alipay or WeChat pay has limit per day,btohqsg
Once you transfer OA to SA there is no going back. You can invest OA in tools to try and get similar or higher returns then SA. If you transfer and next time you wanna use the funds to buy house in future you cannot transfer back btw,btohqsg
For china payment  other than WeChat and alipay and ocbc scan  you can also open a saving account with icbc and get their debit card  put money there and withdraw money from icbc ATM in china  the rate good as well  I did it last time,btohqsg
My advice is to not top up and invest the cash. Tax relief makes sense only if it is hitting very high brackets (15%-22%) and at $40k  I think it is much better at this time to do investment instead.Not financial advice disclaimer and please do your own research.,btohqsg
Thanks for the replies. I am not savvy in cpf investment and my risk appetite is not high. Where should i start if i want to do OA investment?,btohqsg
Im not planning to buy a house in the future  and my current hdb is fully paid. Thats why leaving such a huge amt in OA is not that wise imo...,btohqsg
Can confirm is within 40k or 80k? First 40k only up to 3.5%. Not worth to throw any money for tax relief  deposit money in bank also can cover that.IMO if really not going to use OA  just transfer all to SA.Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Within 80k. Meaning $550 on the first $40k and 7% on the next $40k. Sorry if this is unclear in my original post.,btohqsg
If you not comfortable in investing your cash or investing in any way  can just RSTU $8k to self if you never RSTU/VCMA to self yet. Then ride on the risk free 4%. Likely to beat inflation  and reduce taxes  but that's about it.,btohqsg
It is worth doing vcma 8k correct? To hit BHS earlier and supercharge SA. As well as tax relief,btohqsg
Honestly for your situation no difference. You're still some time away from hitting BHS / to see your MA interest supercharge anything. Long run RSTU will have more but insignificant amount of tax relief opportunities.Only if you willing to invest the monies then you need to give more thoughts.,btohqsg
Quick question! I‚Äôve new-to-bank status for Citi  and applied for Citi SMRT CC in Nov.

I did spend $900+ getting a new iPhone - now my concern is it doesn‚Äôt count because Citi SMRT recognises MCC from Online Purchases  Groceries  Taxi and Public Transport only.For my situation  will I get the $450 paynow reward from SingSaver?,btohqsg
If MCC excluded in promo t&c then no,btohqsg

I give up to use heymax due to missing mile a lot . Need to chase and monitor the missing miles . Waste time . Plan to change back shopback .,btohqsg
Installment payments are generally excluded from both cashback and miles card.Good to read TnC though for the detailsüòä,btohqsg
I personally had few incidents withHeymax.aion missing and pending miles. But each of these incidents were resolved amicably.Heymax.aiis a start up tech company.

So only overseas transaction entitled to that?,btohqsg

Then I ‚Ä¶ pay manually first.,btohqsg
If anyone have a sample for OP to refer to  will be good. Because they're looking at their Citibank CC statement and referring to UOB CC statement.,btohqsg
For Citi bank CC  the GIRO info is printed after the Grand total.,btohqsg
Can you pay online? I feel UOB VS may be better in tjs case.,btohqsg
I think mine still need to pay manually.,btohqsg
Let me take a closer look at UOB VS. Thanks Anthony!,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre that strict. I always get my POSB Everyday card waived even though I don‚Äôt charge anything to it as the total relationship is used to determine waiver.I couldn‚Äôt even tell them to cancel fast enough this year as I called in and the CS cheerfully told me they have waived the AF on my POSB Everyday card before I even asked for it üòëMy intention was to cancel but I felt bad since the CS was so cheerful.,btohqsg

Anyone got experience for Maybank CC promo how they count the months? My F&F got approved and reached me on 10 Dec  are the 2 months spending 10 Dec - 9 Jan and 10 Jan - 9 Feb OR just Dec 2024 and Jan 2025?,btohqsg
You just need to spend 1.3k within the first 2 months. You do not need to target 650 for the first statement and 650 for the second statement mah,btohqsg
Unless u wanna know the cut off date ah,btohqsg
Just take it as 60 days from approval,btohqsg
Ah ok I was confused because the same promo on SingSaver words it as needing to spend 650/650 per month across 2 mnths,btohqsg
Yeah the singsaver one is different I think. But if you apply thru maybank u can just get it immediately when u finish paying ur 1.3k bill,btohqsg

Hi  I want to ask  for CPF education loan  since the CPF interest is 2.5%  is it a net positive if I were to put the amount to tools such as chocolate finance which is giving me 3.6%? Hence just need to pay the minimum sum every month back to CPF?,btohqsg
Hello everyone  want to ask if anyone knows why I use citipayall to pay for my insurance premium but the transaction fail? The policy number has been keyed it correctly,btohqsg
Did you mean:1. Pay school fees ($x) using CPF OA.2. Using $x cash on hand to invest in things like C.F.3. When repayment starts  return min sum back using the returns from the cash invested?That's assuming you already have $x cash on hand ready to invest  and assuming that platforms like C.F. stays above 2.5% p.a.  after fees if any.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  so just to clarify. If i owe $20k to CPF  instead of paying back $20k to CPF straight  would it be better if I invest this 20k into for example Chocolate Finance which gives me 3.6% and return the minimum sums monthly back to CPF?My thought is that  by investing into C.F. the returns will out beat the interest from CPF hence there is no need for me to clear this loan asap. Of course that is only if the investment tools can stay above 2.5% p.a.Or am i missing something?,btohqsg
Yeah. The only interest accrued for CPF Education Loan is the prevailing CPF OA interest rates. Technically the money goes back to you also.I'm just saying that maybe for you  you may have the 20k to invest  but others may not have to pull off this strategy.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask if link HSBC revolution to fairprice app  and use app to pay in store  can count as online spend or is it contactless,btohqsg

So I can only join 2nd quarter 25 promotion? Should empty account by Feb 25?,btohqsg
As I did see the 1x rewards. But bonus end of the month I assume will not be added in,btohqsg
Does it mean not possible to join every quarter  only alternate quarter since my funds only released on 17 Dec? Or I can empty the account on 17 Dec when it was released?,btohqsg
correct.. UOB intentionally changed it so you can no longer do back to back participations for the UOB Savings promo.,btohqsg
Anyway it might be good to give it a miss... good chance UOB One account MIGHT have rate revisions anytime.,btohqsg
Means the CSO also don't know what she isanswering.LOL,btohqsg

Hi guys any knows if you can set different credit limit for each UOB credit card?,btohqsg
Disclaimer: all strategy is always fluid.. If HSBC EGA cuts their rates to below 4% for January/February cycle.. i will eat humble pie and move back into UOB One at 4% p.a.no loyalty no shame.. follow the money,btohqsg
Within bank is shared credit limit.,btohqsg
Why do u need to do that?,btohqsg
and to share  i am using SCB Esaver as the 'holding account' for the 1-2 days across New Year holiday and clarity on January 2025 interest rates.the Esaver Marathon is still paying 2.85% and 2.9% p.a. respectively for December and January ADB.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a rewards cap for every credit card I have. Like UOB preferred plat is only 1.1k limit,btohqsg
vs keeping:1. HSBC EGA which could end up earning 02. UOB One which coudl end up earning peanuts if you decide to move out in first few days January 2025,btohqsg

i have measured and confirmed SCB Esaver's calculation methods.I am not that confident with CIMB interest calculations.That being said  SCB is also where I have set up my Transfer infrastructures so it is easier.,btohqsg
CIMB have sample in their TnC  the rate is higher than SCB,btohqsg
i remember their wordings got issue one..haha.. last day vs month...,btohqsg
"and... of course CIMB is famous for..""Officer will call you back for verification""... i kenna myself b4",btohqsg
not sure if you recall a while back there was confusion where CIMB TNC published wordings that implied..bonus interest is paid on the balance on a certain date.. (of course anyone with a brain won't believe it).. but it was worded as suchyou can have $1 in the entire month and keep $100 000 on last day of the month.. and you get paid bonus interest on $100 000,btohqsg
anyway it is just holding for a few days..2.9% vs 3.3%(?) won't matter too much... confidence and ability to complete movement smoothly is key,btohqsg
I don't have confidence in the bank haha. Not gonna risk for that bit of extra interest. ü§™,btohqsg
didn't wanna say this aloud but i agree.,btohqsg

Is there any recommended money exchange for good HKD rate exchange?,btohqsg
these are only useful if you don't have the discipline to regularly save and invest yourself.the biggest problem is the big fat commissions you pay to the agent (the commission comes from your principal),btohqsg
So you want to do the hard work and learn for yourself. Or you want others to do for you?,btohqsg
Also like I got to keep this policy close to 20yrs to start payout.. and the payout also from my principal.. long run like not earning much,btohqsg

Hi üëã quick question: if one has <$100k   between 360 vs UOB One   which bank account would be recommended?,btohqsg
Depend if u can fulfill the criteria of both bank,btohqsg
I would recommend HSBC EGA and one of the 2 accounts if you can get at least 3% p.a EIR on either (UOB One is easier  but OCBC 360 may get higher than 3% p.a.).,btohqsg
Id say use interest calculators on uob and ocbc website. It will be the easiest way to compare.,btohqsg
Hi all- for tiger broker exisitng user promo.. can I just transfer in to get the 6.8% of coupon and transfer out once coupon is credited?,btohqsg
Oh CIMB? Maybe my $ much smaller,btohqsg
<100K  depending on the amount and thus the tiers and the eirFulfillment wise  uob 1 is easier for me.. but the maximization of its benefits is at 4% at 150K,btohqsg
Mmm do u recommend or not.. ?I left some of my coffers there..Am suspish too,btohqsg
u see it is a lose lose situationif you have small amounts.. whether 2.9% or 3.2% not much differenceif you have big amounts  you want to risk itthus  i went with SCB or similarly reputed banks both ways.,btohqsg

Now till 31 Jan 25  GXS FlexiCard may be a better card to use overseas if compared to Trust Cashback Card ü§îYMMV.,btohqsg
15% cashback on selected category with min spend + 1% cashback on non-selected category without min spendvs5% cashback on all transactions without min spend and up to $3 cashback on transaction of at least $10,btohqsg
yeah i think it sounds pretty decent.my main reason for using Trust overseas is 15% on Dining with minimum FX charges.,btohqsg
since Trust blended rate is 4.9% overall  it might be agar agar the same as GXS Flexicard (i didn't explore this as I don't have GXS),btohqsg
GXS FlexiCard may have more  not forgetting the lucky draw mechanic. Both stack.,btohqsg
btw  who still overseas? most should be coming back.. next week start school liao..,btohqsg

hi gurus  im helping my mom book a flight on SIA/Scoot. i have some questions to confirm some things!i bust UOB lady's this statement month and only applicable card left is UOBKF1. am i allowed to use my KrisFlyer account to help her book? in order to get some miles from the bookingif #1 is a yes 2. i should pay with my UOBKF card directly or is there another ideal/suggested way  and i'd get 3mpd from paying directly (it states KF miles earned per $1 spent on SIA  scoot)?3. are the KF miles the same (or credited to the KF account directly)  from paying via Kris+  paying SIA/scoot/SIA related directly with UOBKF card? as the t&c says posted to your card in a calendar monththank you!,btohqsg
1  yes2 directbtw uob lady is by calendar month not statement month,btohqsg
U can use your uob krisflyer to pay for anyone but only if u book yourself u get scoot benefit but i think there is some benefit change,btohqsg
oh gotcha! so just simply book via SIA/scoot website then pay with UOBKF  and i should receive the 3mpd accordingly?thanks guys!!edit: okay nvm i think trazora has answered it already. thank you both!,btohqsg

Hi gurus I have a query on the 800 spending for the uob kf card. If I plan to book flights to somewhere  must the flight be within the 1 year period please? I.e. If I receive my card in August this year  do I need to go for the flight before August too please? Or does any gurus have any suggestions what to use the 800 on please? Thank you in advance for the advice.,btohqsg
Hi  Merry Christmas üéÑYou will have to spend the S$800 within the year. You do not have to fly within the same period.,btohqsg
Thank you so much. Then I would probably book a flight out later for a short trip. I was planning to take sq to Taiwan during the early part of the year but it seems like more worthwhile to take premium economy class.,btohqsg
hi guys  is dbs safra credit card worth it to apply?,btohqsg
Rare card as not a lot have SAFRA membership. I would say it's a good secondary card once you hit the cap on your main card.1. 3% on local contactless and online spend combined cap at $50 (need to self-redeem on DBS internet banking)2. Minimum spend of $500 (including excluded spends like insurance  mobile wallet top-ups  etc)3. Cashback is calculated based on transaction date  not posted date (can be JIT warrior)4. Great discounts at SAFRA/HomeTeamNS outlets  great deals on SAFRA app  free access to SAFRA facilities (from SAFRA membership)5. No annual fee  as you are already paying for your SAFRA membership6.

Hi im new to HSBC EGA. Can i check that what i need to do to get this 1% cashback for cpf top up is the following:1. Sms to sign up for everyday rewards+2. Rstu using giro option on cpf website and input hsbc ega bank acc detailsGreatly appreciate the advice,btohqsg
U dont need to sms that is for ega saving bonus. U need to fulfill 2k in 5 out criteria,btohqsg
Ah ok. I must have confused with the bonus interest campaign. Thanks!,btohqsg
Do take note that it's too late for this year as the deduction date is 15th. You can set up for next year  and for this year you should use other methods.,btohqsg
"Merry Christmas to all!I'm hoping someone can answer my question so that I can get back to my parent with confidence.My parent is reaching 65 and just received the letter from CPF about his payout. He is asking me to make a full withdrawal of his CPF. In his words  ""I want to take everything out and enjoy my life.""However  I've been reading info from CPF portal and online that there's only a monthly payout based on whatever sum is in the Retirement Account (RA) and choosing the plan in CPF Life.Am I right that there's only monthly payout or is he right that he can withdraw everything. We can't sleep because of this.Send halp. Thank you!",btohqsg
Does this work for 1 time lump sum top up? I saw the giro option on cpf website but never used it b4,btohqsg
I just chose the annual option and deducted 8k on Dec 2024,btohqsg

Good morning gurus sorry I missed out in my question yesterday. For the 800 uob kf card spending on SIA group  does that include the taxes please? Thank you so much for the advice.,btohqsg
Hi  morning! Anyone face this happens before. I use maybank F&F cc to shopping around $300 in taobao app. But check back the app recorded only eligible around $130 earned 8% for online spend other that is 0.3%. i try to call to center asking about this  they reply is since base on the record the transaction is different MCC code  so can't earn the 8% cash back. But i using the same app and pay the order same day  why some is eligible some is not? This is very difficult to me when i need to use f&f cc to pay on taobao  if only 0.3% cashback any cc also more than that why i need to use maybank f&f. Hope any master here can answer to my question. Thanks!,btohqsg
Good morning Gurus  I am consider doing rstu/vcma first time this year and have been reading and watching videos about whether to do vcma or rstu.It seems that lots of people recommend vcma first to reach BHS  mentioning about using the funds when your love ones or you is hospitalized etc and supercharge SA account once reaching BHS.I am thinking if my love ones and I already have integrated shield plan etc  what does topping up medisave do beside the normal clinical consultation or insurance premiums and co-payment. Not to mention  as you age  the salary contribution allocation to MA rises as wellMy concern is that SA could still be taken out after SA exceed FRS or if not turn into monthly payouts. But medisave can only use for medical use and taken out to pass to my beneficiary after I pass away.Sorry for being so longwinded,btohqsg
Personally I think shield plan does not cover 100%. Medisave money (touch wood) could be used anytime while money in your SA could only be touched earliest at 55 I believe. When your medisave is full  all other money would flow into your SA account first followed by your OA if your SA has hit frs.,btohqsg
Most importantly it also depends on your age now.,btohqsg
Any recommendations on purchasing travel insurance and earning rewards? E.g via Shopee or Klook,btohqsg
Airport tax included as well as bank see the mcc description charge to card not the breakdown. They dont care what u purchase or pay for at sia grp,btohqsg
Shopping platform like lazada  qoo10  taobao  amazon etc can have varies mcc that is a known fact thus u if using whitelist card u run the risk of mcc fall outside the whitelist as bank dont determine your transaction mcc,btohqsg
Meaning when i use it in taobao also not guarantee can earn the cashback,btohqsg
U are not gurantee to get the bonus cashback. U get the base loh. U can look at various card tnc and decide for yourself which cashback card suit u,btohqsg
Hello morning and Merry Christmas all!I have a question regarding paying for recurring GE insurance monthly payments.I am currently charging my GE annual insurance premiums to my OCBC cashflow card because they allow splitting of these annual premiums into 12 months of monthly repayment with a 1% processing fee (otherwise  I will be paying one big sum in one shot). however  I feel like I am not optimising my ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) in this manner.I would like to know if there's anyone in the same situation as me (i.e. breaking up yearly GE insurance premiums into monthly payments) and how you are optimising your ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) using either Cardup or Ipaymy.,btohqsg
The next big problem isinstantly losing upto 7.5%upfront on every premium paid in fees. Premium paid haven't entered the underlying fund but already lose cash value.,btohqsg
No liao  they changed the % relief to fixed dollar relief. So pissed off,btohqsg
Hi merry Xmas üéÑüéäüéâ all may I know my mother can transfer some of her retirement savings from cpf to my ordinary account please? Thank you,btohqsg
Thanks for your view! I am in my thirties. Usually do people actually use at least half or more of their medisave (70plus k) for those reaching BHS? I mean let say the person and love both have the shield plan. And premium for insurance are cover by the interest generated. Some of the comprehensive shield plans also come with yearly free health screening and health checks. Perhaps medisave for those outpatient medical bills only that aren't covered by shield plans?,btohqsg
I thought the interest generated goes into the common pools and does not belongs to you? Those interest in the common pool will benefit those live beyond certain threshold age? Eg  84.,btohqsg
Bcz i almost very month will shopping in taobao and review all the cc   the maybank f&f is suitable for me   since have 5 categories earn 8% cashback and saw the taobao also included in the categories. But now i feel is different story. So sad,btohqsg
No. Transfer to RA is one way. There is no transfer out process except through the payout,btohqsg

Uob PPV:MOBILEpaywaveUob VS: paywave (can be tap card or tap phone),btohqsg
I don't think it is a matter of using it unless your plan is to put the money in your SA and use it to invest. I believe most people would not advise doing so. The key thing would be your intention. If both your medisave and SA are far from hitting the limit then I would think you can also choose to invest in either one.,btohqsg
Interest will be generated for both RA and CPF life.Interest for RA will be yours  while for CPF life will be in a centralised pool.,btohqsg
It's a taobao problem. They charge the MCC differently based on what you buy  and sometimes they may charge you differently even for the same item from the same shop.,btohqsg
"Not sure what you mean ""SA could be taken out after SA exceed FRS"". Before you reach 55  there's absolutely no way to touch SA other than to invest (which is one of the worst decisions  as there is nothing offered to beat SA'srisk free  fee free4% interest).The 2 strategies are mainly:1. RSTU first if you want to have a bit more tax relief opportunities from CPF top-ups (insignificant because there's still SRS)  as SA contributions (mandatory/interest) will stay in SA.2. VCMA first if you want to supercharge your SA or OA if SA have met FRS. Can be used for insurance premiums like Integrated Shield Plan (and rider) and CareShield Life (and supplementary plan).For more details can watch this video by Chris:https://youtu.be/CuXXX5F1cYE",btohqsg
When she gets the CPF life payout  you use the money to VC3A lor. No tax reliefs  not advisable.,btohqsg

Quick qus  do I still earn the 5% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance if i were to say i transfer all of my OA to SA? Meaning now my OA is $0.,btohqsg
There is no min spend for that card thou?,btohqsg
Do you mean income requirement? They are not strict with the 80k annual income,btohqsg
Don't have. Just note the short expiry on the points. 1yr on the card itself,btohqsg
Ya. That is one reason I choose to go with UOB lady card to clock travel related transactions,btohqsg
Ah I mean after 55  once Ra is created and filled up with SA and OA (not touch if your SA is sufficient)  you could take the excess amount above FRS out.Hence at least I have a chance to take out funds from SA or at least it increases my monthly payouts.But medisave only could take out through outpatient medical bills/insurance premium or co-payment for love ones or yourself. In that sense  how probable could I actually use up medisave up till BHS if there is coverage from integrated plans.,btohqsg
The excess will go to OA at 55. You typically wouldn't really use up your MA  but excess MA interest will go into OA if SA have already met FRS.This overflowed interest that goes into OA can then be usednow(if OA is above $20k)  for HDB loan or investments (that can beat 3.5% p.a.).Either way it does not make a big difference  most will meet BHS eventually if they are actively topping up SA or MA.,btohqsg
"I feel like the true purpose here of VCMA should not be to aim at higher payouts. While true that u may not utilise the full BHS if nothing serious medically happens   BUT WHAT IF u fall very ill one day and need alot of coverage from MA?Just like u do not buy insurance hoping to ""cash out"" or earn from it. It's a backup should smth happen to u.",btohqsg
I mean personally if you are unable to utilise your medisave is a good thing. If you top up your SA now all the money are stuck there. If you do need it for medical purpose  you can't touch it. I am not too sure if you should aim for ers instead of frs at your age.,btohqsg
Hi experts Would like to seek your advice/ recommendation.Context:- Never top up CPF SA and MA before- Never open SRS account before- Want to get tax relief now- Just a single starting to buy a resale nowHow could I smartly get a tax relief and at the same time prepare/ build up for retirement?- Top up SA vs MA?- Open SRS account (flexibility to withdraw in case needed to use for housing costs such as Reno etc or just personal urgent needs?)Current sum:SA: 55kMA: 67KHave watched YouTube videos but still can‚Äôt decide the best way to do so.Thank you.,btohqsg
Your MA is 4500 from the max for this year. It depends on how many percent is your tax? 3.5% or 7%,btohqsg
Thank you all  I will try to apply   since no min spend. Alternative will be UOB lady. Merry Christmas to all.,btohqsg
I am no expert but I would probably top up medisave 4.5k and SA 3.5k. It also depends on how much is the chargeable income under the 7% band. Depending on your age which I assume likely to be less than 40  srs may not be the best option for you. Finally  I would think that one should only do top up to reduce tax if you have a lot of spare cash on hand as the savings are generally negligible.,btohqsg
Most importantly this are my personal view and not financial advice if it even falls under that category.,btohqsg
Thank you guys for your views! Appreciate loads!,btohqsg
Income this year is a unusually high for me at almost $100k but with CPF deduction  the chargeable income is at 80k so still in the 7% bracket.I‚Äôm looking at how I can start preparing for retirement and at the same time  get the tax relief. Feel that I‚Äôm so late in the game and feeling the anxiety.,btohqsg
Don't worry so much. Having high income is a good thing. I would gladly pay my taxes if my income is high. I started pretty late myself.,btohqsg
Latest Chris video on SRS is a hint for top up decision making as well. 100k then strive for 150k subsequent. Cheers!,btohqsg
Need to be mindful that srs can only be taken out currently from the age of 63 or is it 64?,btohqsg
63. But flexibility to withdraw (chargeable for 100% + 5% penalty) during urgent times,btohqsg
Since you're starting to buy a resale  you should calculate if you have enough cash for your renovations/loans repayment.It's better to pay the small income tax now than finding yourself having to pay the likely higher (as you'll be in a higher tax bracket) income tax + penalty fees when you withdraw it before the stipulated retirement age.,btohqsg
If you put money inside srs  you need to invest it. Why not invest it outside of srs?,btohqsg
Very true. All my money in my srs account I don't need it till retirement but I don't have much anyway.,btohqsg
Paiseh  I think cashback capped at $50 per calendar month. Another good point about this card is cashback is calculated based on transaction date,btohqsg
Oops yes $50. Updated the original message,btohqsg
I am currently using this card,btohqsg
Oh yea  for cashback  only valid for 12 months.,btohqsg
Monthly just redeem no need to think already. One of the best cards to charge insurance to  it helps to guarantee you the min spend.,btohqsg
The chargaeble income is wrong. If u withdraw before 63 u will get 100% tax on withdrawn amt + 5% penalty.,btohqsg
Oh yes! That‚Äôs right. Thanks for pointing out the error!,btohqsg
New on the mile card. If With 2 or 3 mile card to get miles   how u guys pull all the mile together to buy airticket ?,btohqsg
And remember  tax relief is reducing chargeable income  and not reducing charged tax itself. So you may reduce chargeable income at 7% this year  but be charged chargeable income at 11% for the early withdrawal next year for example.,btohqsg
Just curious and if you don‚Äôt mind sharing  do you contribute to your SRS every year?Or people do take gap years where they skip a year or more in contributing to SRS until 62/63 yo?,btohqsg
Understand. SRS is really for the long term. Not wise to withdraw early unless in dire circumstances or confirmed reduced life expectancy I guess.,btohqsg
"The only unpenalised ""reduced life expectancy"" is death.",btohqsg
Currently yes but I only started like 2 3 years back. I do invest it in some policies which the gurus may not recommend haha but unfortunately I am not good at investing myself so I just have to make do with it. Unless you foresee that your chargeable income would keep on increasing. I am also less than 20 years from retirement age thus I think it is a good time to start.,btohqsg
I feel you! Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
I do make donations to reduce my tax too haha.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I just open ocbc 360 account.. to qualify for 100k bonus interest with 500 incremental saving Vs Dec.. how much do I need to deposit on 1st Jan.. if let say I‚Äôm not planning to credit any amount in Dec,btohqsg
If Dec is 0 then Jan would be any amount above I guess 520sgd,btohqsg
To get the max return then I need to deposit 100k by 1st Jan?,btohqsg
To maximise the interest would probably be at least above 98k?,btohqsg
1st Jan is PH so I‚Äôm not sure how it will calculated,btohqsg
You can't do so as 1st is PH. It is tricky to maximise interest as you would not be able to maximise it the following month. However  I believe the amount should be like 103 350 to maximise it for Jan.,btohqsg
Ph is not counted. U deposit on 1st jan it will be taken as deposit on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Quick qus  do I still earn the 5% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance if i were to say i transfer all of my OA to SA? Meaning now my OA is $0.,btohqsg
Hmm.. then if I deposit 5k by 30Dec then balance 95k on 1st Jan?,btohqsg
Nope the 60k is 20k OA 40k SA,btohqsg
Oh I have to leave at least 20k in OA to enjoy the 5% interest?,btohqsg
This would not be enough too as it means your balance is 5k on day one and 100k from day two to 31st. So if I am not wrong  your Jan mab would be 305k divide by 31,btohqsg
OA max interest I believe is 3.5% and SA is 5%,btohqsg
Why don't just deposit 100k on 31 Dec morning? Your concern is just the $500 incremental right?Unless you cannot deposit the whole 100k on 31 Dec?,btohqsg
You need to let is know what is your OCBC360 plan in Feb 2025 too for us to comment. OCBC360 gives high interest on first 100k only.,btohqsg
No. You can put 60k combined SA+MA and enjoy 5% p.a. on the 60k.,btohqsg
Oh sorry for my wrong info. I didn't know about MA,btohqsg
Oh i thought the additional 1% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance only capped at 20k at OA. What i mean is there should be no difference between these 2 scenarios:Scenario 1: OA-0  SA-30k  MA-30kScenario 2: OA-10k  SA-40k  MA-10k,btohqsg
Yea.. I just wan to ensure than 500 incremental is captured as well for the first 100k deposited,btohqsg
Not major plan ah.. I jus aiming to the saving and salary crediting cat oni,btohqsg
You are correct. Additional 1% p.a. interest only capped $20k for OA. There is a difference. Scenario 2 will lose out 1.5% p.a. on $10k as the combined SA+MA is only $50k.Scenario 1: 5% p.a. on $60kScenario 2: 3.5% p.a. on $10k  5% p.a. on $50k,btohqsg
Then how much do I need to deposit on 30th in order to help Jan boost up 100k of  ADB,btohqsg
Then don't make it confusing. Just deposit $100k on 30 or 31 Dec. Your MAB for Jan will be the full $100k.,btohqsg
Hmm.. oki.. then wat about the 500 of incremental saving ? How to achieve?,btohqsg
I don't think my cpf comment is wrong though,btohqsg
??? It's already achieved.Your MAB in Jan is going to be more than Dec  by a lot.,btohqsg
It is additional 1% and up to 5% of the combined cpf balances. However  if say a person has OA 50k SA 50k and MA 50k  I am not sure what is the priority.,btohqsg
Hi all  if anyone has tried using giro to top up MA pls let me know? üôèSo far I've only found on cpf website for giro to retirement  or to MA for self-employed.Intending to top up on 1 Jan. Tks!,btohqsg
Then you need to read this:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/how-much-extra-interest-can-i-earn-on-my-cpf-savings,btohqsg
However it states additional 1%. It didn't state that 20k from OA would be getting 5% interest but having said that  I didn't track my interest on my cpf all the time,btohqsg
20k from OA will get 3.5% p.a.2.5 + 1 = 3.5,btohqsg
Don't buy from taobao lor... Or just accept the occasional 0.3% cashback / use another card with wider MCC whitelist or standard exclusions instead.,btohqsg
Oh wow thanks for the reply. I didnt know that there is an order on how combined cpf balances are computed. So the order is RA>OA>SA>MA. If I have no use for my OA at all (not planning to invest/buy property)  it would be wise for me to transfer all my OA balances to SA so that now the first 60k combined cpf balances will be solely from SA  and I can earn 5%(4% base + 1% extra) on this 60k am I right? If i were to leave balances in OA  since the order prioritize OA first before SA  i will only earn 3.5% (2.5% base + 1% extra) on the OA balance  and then earn 5% (4% base + 1% extra) on the remaining SA balances up to 60k? Someone pls confirm my understanding üòÖ,btohqsg
The message you replied to should have confirmed what you typed.,btohqsg
I have a video on this already.https://youtu.be/Undg39HHvBY?si=Hw4sXzrQOPe20UrLThere are discussions on the nuances of which order  but to keep it simple: More than 20k in OA and less than 60K in combined balances? Please consider to take some action to maximise interest,btohqsg
I think you still don‚Äôt understand what I mean. Assuming you hit $100k in Jan 2025  to enjoy high interest in Feb  you need to top up $500 in Feb  this $500 does not earn high interest eg. 0.5% only. You need to keep top up $500 Mar  April  May ‚Ä¶. To enjoy high interest rate for first $100k. Any amount above $100k only earns 0.5%,btohqsg
Isnt the order on how combined cpf balances are computed important as well? Since the base interest rate of OA is only 2.5%  and the base interest rate of SA is higher at 4%. Meaning to really maximise interest  one would leave as little balances in OA as possible isnt it?,btohqsg
Any way to better manage this portion?,btohqsg
Which is why  focus on the 60k combined balance. Not the 20k OA,btohqsg
Please download the OCBC 360 calculator and input your own date and figureshttps://ko-fi.com/s/612320b77a,btohqsg
But you need to also remember that OA transfer is irreversible  you should also take in account your future OA usage. The magic number is 40k combined SA+MA  and let your OA grow for future use.,btohqsg
old scheme mothers still ok.. just that capped by the $80k... also already very angry,btohqsg
What im trying to say is take for example these 2 scenarios:Scenario 1- OA: 10k  SA: 50k  MA: 0Interest= 10k*3.5% + 50k*5% = $2 850Scenario 2- OA: 0  SA: 60k  MA: 0Interest= 60k*5% = $3 000So from maximising interest perspective  one would leave as little balances in OA as possible  because the order prioritise OA before SA/MA.,btohqsg
The country needs to rely on taxes to run ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Why is the magic number 40k for SA+MA? Why is it important to leave 20k in OA?,btohqsg
It all depends on your personal CPF strategy. I personally invest my OA and it has a higher yield than SA. You can only utilise the amounts excess of 20k.If you have absolutely no use for OA till retirement  then you can full force transfer everything to SA. There is no wrong or right.,btohqsg
Oh I see. Im not savvy in investments and my risk appetite is very low. So i prefer to shift my OA to SA for that risk-free 4%.  In addition  i have no plans to buy a house or invest using OA.,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm trying to pay my annual insurance via cardup (using uob privimiles visa). My agent (Prudential) sent me a link where they require giro payments from bank/credit card. But from cardup‚Äôs end it seems to be keying in insurance policy number and payment amount. My agent told me it may be possible to just pay via cardup without their link. If so  it seems like i cannot pay for all insurance policies in a single cardup transaction. Seems like i have to pay separately and key in the insurance policies separately. Anyone experts who paid to prudential previously?,btohqsg
What I do is to setup eGIRO with DBS via Prudential website  then cancel the GIRO arrangement on DBS internet banking (so they can't deduct from my account or card). Then setup CardUp to pay Prudential on due date. Setup each policy individually.,btohqsg

Hi  between ocbc 365 and trust Cashback which is better for oversea dining?,btohqsg
Hi Experts! Can I check if I do OA to SA transfer  can I withdraw anything above FRS after turning 55?I just knew that any rstu is not lump sum withdrawable even you have exceeded FRS. Only through normal contribution is allow.,btohqsg
Usually based on normal rtsu it is still possible to withdraw everything above frs since the normal rtsu will form part of frs.For example:Normal contributions over the years = $300kRtsu = $100kFrs = $250kYou will still be able to easily withdraw $150k (400-250).,btohqsg
Yes you are right. Do note that any interest earned on RSTU amounts cannot be withdrawn and is set aside in your RA.,btohqsg
trust cashback (dining category  min $500/mth for 3 months) > ocbc 365 (min $800/mth) > trust cashback (no min spend  non dining category),btohqsg
Haha! I call cpf just now and raise similar exampleI.e. at 55  I have FRS + 12Kbut before I turn 55  I RSTU 8K  so does that means I can only with 4k only? She told me yes...,btohqsg
So using your logic  I should be able to draw 12k less any interest accrued from the 8k,btohqsg
dcs flex needs $600 which is in the upper range for you. might cause forced spending. can also consider uob one or maybank plat visa which has lower min spend,btohqsg
My logic is if u are normal worker. Work for life. U can safely withdraw all amounts above frs even if u max contribute annually,btohqsg
Eh? Why ah? Shouldn‚Äôt it still be 12k withdrawable? Anything above FRS can withdraw right?,btohqsg
Correct but most normal people won‚Äôt have thisThey will already have amounts way above frs excluding rtsu,btohqsg
Ya.. she say rstu and interest strictly only withdrawable through monthly payouts at 65,btohqsg
Correct but just think of it this way and u won‚Äôt be worried.U are withdrawing your normal work contributions above frs amount.Your rtsu contributions happily forming the base frs locked up.,btohqsg
I wonder how much porn was posted. If it's just one post  and the user reported it to Telegram. Then getting suspended is too much. That's too easy to get any group suspended.,btohqsg
So in this case  I can withdraw only 50k instead of 150k because 100k from rstu which form my Retirement sum,btohqsg
Not right. U forgot your employee normal contributions,btohqsg
No. It‚Äôs total CPF - frs,btohqsg
No  monies topped up to a CPF Special Account through the Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. The money is intended to be used to join CPF LIFE when you turn 65 years old. CPF LIFE is an annuity scheme that provides a monthly payout for life.,btohqsg
Thanks. So in that sense  I can only draw out my working SA contribution (let say SA is sufficient and leave OA aside first) -FRS and that example 300k-250k=50k. My RA will still got 250k (FRS)+ 100k(RSTU)=350K which will use to compute cpf life payout at 65,btohqsg
And can I check if normal OA to SA transfer got this lump sum withdrawal restriction as well?,btohqsg
Hi for OCBC reward card spending on health screening is it eligible for the OCBC$ bonus?,btohqsg
Your example looks confusing. Do you mean if you have 200k normal contributions and 100k rstu  how much would you get at the age of 55?,btohqsg
Ah I use MT scenariosFor example:Normal contributions over the years = $300kRtsu = $100kFrs = $250kYou will still be able to easily withdraw $150k (400-250).,btohqsg
I have not looked into this but based on my interpretation of the advice above  your RA would consist of the 100k rstu and 150k from normal contributions I.e. You can withdraw the 150k remaining from your normal contributions and your RA would be 250k.,btohqsg
So I don't understand why does your RA has 350k instead of 250k though there is nothing stopping you from topping up.,btohqsg
However I may have interpreted it wrongly too.,btohqsg
Hmm I think I get it now. I keep excluding rstu in my FRS and thinking it as FRS can only include working contribution,btohqsg
And rstu only is an add on to that amount,btohqsg
But don't know why the cpf woman told me this...I.e. at 55  I have FRS + 12Kbut before I turn 55  I RSTU 8K  so does that means I can only with 4k only? She told me yes...asSo the logics should be I still can withdraw 12k as that 8k form up my FRS. The excess is treated as from my working contribution,btohqsg
But when you already reach FRS  you are not allowed to RSTUSo you cannot top up the $8k,btohqsg
I think there is some confusion caused in your question. I assume you rstu the 8k before you hit frs so the calculation could be a bit more complicated than that.,btohqsg

Sorry gurus I would like to seek your views on card up. I am planning to make a one time insurance payment of 2000sgd. I should be getting 2800 miles by using card up but I would be paying like $45.20 (2.26%) for the fees. As I value miles at 0.125 cents each  it seems like I would be paying more for the miles.

Has anyone uses tiger broker cash boost account with CDP linkage to sell their SG shares residing in CDP? How is the experience?,btohqsg
Your $8k is already part of your FRS. Why will only be $4k? It will be $12k withdrawable. Unless can't hit FRS  most should be able to withdraw amounts above FRS.,btohqsg
I can tell you that in this group chat  at least once a day. Really need everyone to help ping admins if any unwanted content like porn or scam.,btohqsg
Assuming your SA is beyond FRS at 55  your RA will be formed with RSTU (and its interests) + mandatory contributions to SA (FRS - RSTU).Excess mandatory contributions to SA will go into OA unless you transfer to RA  and whatever is in OA is withdrawable anytime.,btohqsg
No but you restrict the monies to be used for OA usages like HDB or education loan. In exchange you get 1.5% p.a. more.,btohqsg
Use another card to top-up TnG card instead?,btohqsg
Just follow CardUp's instructions  they will provide the recommended date for deduction. IRAS will do the resolution backend to check if you've paid or not.Remember that Jan's deduction is for Feb's payment. So GIRO will still be deducted for Jan's payment  if you cannot setup to make payment for next week.,btohqsg
If your MA haven't hit BHS and you haven't hit annual tax relief cap  why not?,btohqsg
$8k tax relief cap from RSTU and VCMA is separate from annual CPF contribution cap.,btohqsg
This is for topping-up of CPF accounts  not VCMA or RSTU.,btohqsg
For the past 12 months  most banks have started doing this due to security. You're better off leaving the limits untouched once you change or changing it earlier.,btohqsg
Yes  do remember 1 Jan is PH  so it'll be counted as $0 for that day. Make sure you clear all amounts on 1 Feb morning as it's a Saturday.,btohqsg
why would this be troublesome?the troublesome is if they decide to HOLD the transfer pending a phone verification,btohqsg
Nothing more troublesome than setting up interbank GIRO with DBS üò°üò°üò°,btohqsg
Thanks melvyn for the confirmation. Noted on the 1st jan counting. Dont have a choice as i need dec to be exactly $0,btohqsg

Can UOB ppv be used for Apple online store?,btohqsg
I did the math  you'll lose $20 of interest if you put in on 2 Jan instead of 31 Dec.,btohqsg
Best to check if t&c states Amaze transactions is excluded or not.,btohqsg
Thanks. But i need to meet my $500 save in ocbc. So i dont have a choice. My calculation is exactly $501 increase,btohqsg
Ah sad. Better to lose $20 than $120.,btohqsg

Hmm maybe you went to the VCMA top up page?,btohqsg
Thanks! Ya  I call again and double confirm everything above FRS is withdrawable,btohqsg
Even if u have made rstu? As long above all can take out?,btohqsg
That depends on how much is your total RSTU + interests earned,btohqsg
Hi experts May I check who is eligible for cash top up for self CPF MA?My CPF portal only allows top up to SA.,btohqsg
top up MA is a different route from top up SA. could that be the reason?,btohqsg
Did you try the top up your medisave link instead?https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/growing-your-savings/saving-more-with-cpf/top-up-your-medisave-savings,btohqsg
Anyway as long as you work for life. It is mathematically impossible for your rtsu to be more than your salary SA contribution.,btohqsg
My understanding  pls correct me if I am wrong. For eg. SA account( 400k from normal work contribution  100k from rstu + int)  Assuming frs is 450k  your FRS will be formed first by 100k from rstu+ 350k from normal work contribution  therefore u can withdraw 50k. BUT if your work contribution is 400k  rstu +int is 500k  u can only withdraw 400 k since rstu cannot be withdrawn even if it is higher than frs 450k.,btohqsg
Your theory is correct but in reality  this may never happen,btohqsg
In theory yes cuz apple store mcc is within UOB ppv online whitelist. However  there was dp apple store charging card as offline transaction. ü•≤Better just paywave at the store if possible,btohqsg
RSTU+RSTU interest = reserved amounts = reserved for RA = CPF Life annuity at 65 (non withdrawable at will  only monthly payouts)This is what CPF means when they say RSTU top up cannot be withdrawn,btohqsg
But the reality is most people's RSTU Funds will never hit above FRS (unless maxed out at birth age 0),btohqsg
Hi next year top up parent's cpf gov matching grant increased from 600 to 2000 but no more tax relief. what is your take on this? i have been contributing 600 every year for the past 5 years. unsure whether want to continue next year since no more tax relief.,btohqsg
RSTU/VCMA to their accounts instead? Policies change  just adapt.,btohqsg
