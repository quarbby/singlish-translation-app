Telco and ultility. Basically my telco is under staff plan and they require me to giro. Thus thought to make use of ocbc 365 to set up recurring.But dont know if this count as giro,btohqsg
Wont count as GIRO as GIRO is for bank accounts. But see if your company can accept credit card recurring paymentsReference:https://www.starhub.com/personal/support/article.html?id=4GbTedCDXq9GKJ26CA4pL8#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20Recurring%20GIRO No%20worry%20about%20late%20payment,btohqsg
Not cool Chris - no need to be snarky. Many of us signed up through FTX via your referral. You don't owe it to us but doesn't make it cool for you to laugh at the victims,btohqsg

Anyone else here waiting more than a week for ocbc 360... üò¢,btohqsg
If to miles is most value for money. Always wait for conversion bonus if there is still long expiry,btohqsg
This is processing fee  cannot be waived,btohqsg
Now is sort of bank run. [crypto exchange run] so probably all will crash like hell.,btohqsg
