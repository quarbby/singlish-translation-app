i mean issa their native language,btohqsg
Wah watch these videos confirm can improve Chinese lol,btohqsg
this guy video used in classrooms btw,btohqsg
Lol he used the key and peele drop the soap scene,btohqsg
hey  sorry@smellyomelette  we don't allow people to advertise surveys here :) if you wanna advertise ur survey you can do so at the survey section in our discord!,btohqsg
i'll help u send 1 response though HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Thanks man  so sorry about that,btohqsg
i kenna banned by discord le,btohqsg
i say something like median population in singapore can afford to pay off student debt in 2-3 years,btohqsg
but some guy to the left of the bell curve kb me,btohqsg
is this on our discord server lol,btohqsg
then i emphasized is median population,btohqsg
man you can be correct in your argument but i was reading the discussion as it was unfurling in the chat,btohqsg
well  im sure that wasn't the reason why you're banned. our mod logs are public  and our mods do not ban anyone unless there was a legit reason to do so,btohqsg
maybe your argument no problem but you weren't exactly arguing in a very rational/non-confrontational way either,btohqsg
just cos i from cambridge i shit on other ppl,btohqsg
all these kinds of thing lor,btohqsg
u can go read the chat if u like la,btohqsg
Maybe they think that you are too elite for them to handle,btohqsg
if a community of people feel that your behaviour is not acceptable  maybe there is an issue with the behaviour you were showing in that chat,btohqsg
i mean if they muted on discord i trust their judgment,btohqsg
"rather than ""a community"" i feel is a few specific ppl",btohqsg
since its this particular guy who 卖惨and take offense,btohqsg
i mean at the end of the day i can't stop you from feeling like you were wronged by the discord mods but i have to say that i respect them and i think if they muted their reasons were legitimate la,btohqsg
but maybe the reason for muting wasn't communicated clearly,btohqsg
I think the tele mods trying not to judge the discord mod judgement then later undermine discord mod role lol,btohqsg
"the mod thinks ""just cos im from cambridge goesnt give me a free pass to shit at other peoples jobs""",btohqsg
i'm in the discord  i interact w the discord mods,btohqsg
i mean ya there's that element but i genuinely respect them and think that they are good mods,btohqsg
use that argument hard to rebut sia,btohqsg
i mean sg has reserves and isn't printing money la so,btohqsg
What if become PE teacher ah,btohqsg
actually pe teacher quite shiok leh,btohqsg
it is  and one of the worst paid,btohqsg
then just tell people go play game,btohqsg
Pay is dependent on qualifications and rank,btohqsg
Idt is on what sub u teach,btohqsg
honestly i havent seen alot of people aspiring to be teachers,btohqsg
PE teachers dont need mark homework,btohqsg
no need do much admin work,btohqsg
If you have masters then higher salary ah,btohqsg
Yea civil service all like that one,btohqsg
I thought PE teacher same pay as other subject teacher,btohqsg
teachers one of the shagest shit in china,btohqsg
Ull most likely teach a sub subject also,btohqsg
U cannot just be a PE teacher,btohqsg
Jc pe teachers beo xmm nia,btohqsg
I got one PE teacher whose also PW teacher,btohqsg
My JC all pe teachers except head got teach another subject or handle admin issues,btohqsg
