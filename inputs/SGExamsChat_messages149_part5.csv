I mean if Tharman has to say that anyone can be kind why don't I see PAP being very kind,btohqsg
Why are so many of you interested in politics when you can't vote just yet?,btohqsg
It's good to think about it now and for GP,btohqsg
tbh its good that people become politically aware lmao,btohqsg
Would you rather have a voter who‚Äôs been thinking about politics for years  or have a voter who started thinking about politics months ago,btohqsg
compare how politically insensitive our youths are to those in hong kong lmao,btohqsg
PAP big king give me $600 guys vote me pap,btohqsg

If you receive the cheque it is a uob cheque,btohqsg
Gave Wee Cho Yaw $300 too,btohqsg
Even the mediocre ones hold high paying jobs so they don't really need it anyway,btohqsg
The former CEO of UOB? The first $600 is standard for those over 21 and the second payment depends on your salary and age and if you have children or not,btohqsg
Since I'm not above 50 and I don't have children and am poor  my second payment is $600,btohqsg
This is the second payment only,btohqsg
First payment is $600 for everyone,btohqsg
Because an apathetic youth demographic is harmful,btohqsg

They seem deeper and hve more substance than english article? Is it just an impression??,btohqsg
yes haha i think cause got a lot of metaphor and a lot of meaning in a few characters! that's why,btohqsg
Not necessarily. But Chinese articles don't have to care about copyright in general,btohqsg
Whats the implication behind this copyright issue then?,btohqsg
In most english sites  you need to reference properly,btohqsg
