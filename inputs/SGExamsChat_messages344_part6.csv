What‚Äôs the possibility/probability of getting B3 overall if oral is a merit?,btohqsg
Cos my teacher said B3 quite low but B4 is high,btohqsg
The benchmark for Merit to be B4 & 3 (Some actually can get A2 even),btohqsg
You are likely to get B3/A2 for Merit at the second sitting,btohqsg
Since the first sitting is always tougher  you are likely to get B3/B4 instead,btohqsg
It is possible to jump up to 2 grades higher for the second sitting!,btohqsg
If you can get B3/4 with Merit  that is considered good enough!,btohqsg
