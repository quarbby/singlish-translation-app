After bodykit goes up  the next thing you know  you need that slightly lowered stance as the icing on the cake haha,btohqsg

Tesla is just a normal car with basic AI and electric eng (life size RC car) to me,btohqsg

I think electric cars are not very perfect at present  and it takes a long time to charge. However  Tesla's sales volume is really very strong. I don't know why,btohqsg
Not really before we had buggy is the same,btohqsg
Actually right now electric or gas cars is the same lor haha,btohqsg
