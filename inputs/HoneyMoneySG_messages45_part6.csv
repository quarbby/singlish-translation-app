hmm is it a google pay thing?i don't see the option to add a UOB card to Applepay on the TMRW app,btohqsg
Yea Android only  no idea why,btohqsg
Does anyone know which card works with cardup to give miles when paying AIA premiums?Someone said dbs vantage works but I just saw that insurance is excluded for dbs cards,btohqsg
Does that mean that if I paid for my insurance with vantage through card up I will still get 1.5mpd?,btohqsg
Hello just want to see the opinion of you guys. Do you think after settling fixed and variable expenses and setting aside for investment. With the remaining $400-500  should I top up SA or MA? (28y/o btw),btohqsg
My opinion is top up SA because it will count towards the full retirement sum while MA do not. Besides  MA is not withdrawable even you reach 65 and in fact until we die.,btohqsg
Medisave does not count towards FRS?,btohqsg
Wow I just went to re-read OA/SA/Medisave account details. Yes Medisave will not form part of Retirement Account at all!,btohqsg
It's easier to top up the MA to BHS 1st as it's lower. Any additional contributions to MA will flow to SA.. then u can consider to top up ur SA,btohqsg
Are you saying it is better to topup Medisave before Special Account  because once Special Account is full  it will go to Ordinary Account.While if you topup Medisave  it will overflow to Special Account then Ordinary Account?Purpose is to maximise balance in the 4% earning accounts ya?,btohqsg
Yes top up MA to BHS first  supercharge your SA.Plus when you top up SA all these amts are reserved and you cant do shielding,btohqsg
Whether better or not  is up to u... For me  BHS is lower  I'll top up MA 1st... Easier to achieve...,btohqsg
Depends what u want to achieve... Think when MA rch BHS  u won't be able to top up to MA...,btohqsg
end result should be same  whether u max out MA or SA first,btohqsg
yeah i tot so too.. as long as in the end you max Medisave and SA asap.. does it matter which account to be topped up first?,btohqsg
"to me i think is same  although its ""easier"" to max out MA cos amount is lower",btohqsg
I am not familar with the latest CPF rules (I am from the old era where can get $7k tax savings for SA topup and $7k tax savings for Medisave topup).I know it has changed recently  so maybe there is some difference which u choose now?,btohqsg
total is $8k for self now,btohqsg
so technically the tax relief amount is lower? last time can claim max $21k tax relief.... can topup ownself and parents i think...,btohqsg
parents only if their annual income less than $4k,btohqsg
rules keep changing.. better be very familar.. haha...,btohqsg
Any amount that you RSTU into your SA is reserved  and cannot be used for investments. So when the time comes for your RA to be formed  you cannot do CPF shielding to shield this amt in your SA from being drawn into your RA first instead of your OA,btohqsg
WOW they are able to track and remember such things over the years?But anyway  when my time comes at 55 (hope no changes)  I will likely withdraw the maximum in cash. What is the incentive to do CPF shielding these days? When bank interest rates are above 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Just log into your CPF portal to see  mine is like that,btohqsg
Imagine you turned 55 in 2021 you want to withdraw ah? High bank int is the rarity and not the norm as far as I can rmb,btohqsg
shielding is just to take the money to invest in bond basically right,btohqsg
Mine says this but I’m pretty sure I topped up more than $4.7k to my SA in the course of my life??,btohqsg
ya lo  weird  mine also very small dollar amount,btohqsg
Yep@ChrisHMSGhas done aplenty videos on this,btohqsg
Are these historical topups + interest on these topups FROM THE GOVERNMENT (i.e. FREE MONEY).. or are these topups that we used cash to topup for tax savings?,btohqsg
the $7k per year thing for tax relief?,btohqsg
cannot be... i definitely voluntary topped up my SA much more than this amount..unless there is a cutoff year this started?,btohqsg
There’s no guarantee that the bank interest rates will continue so CPF shielding is one way to lock in the interest rate of 4%,btohqsg
got it!i guess it is a blessing in disguise then that my Reserved Amount is $4772 only.. basically this is the amount of my SA that cannot be shielded la..not going to email CPF to ask why only $4772.. whatever.. hahahah,btohqsg
hmmm FRS sum will already be earning 4% p.a. (plus whatever bonuses).I would rather take out the amounts above FRS to do more investments or buy more housings for example. Why leave idle at 4% p.a.,btohqsg
cos at 55 you shouldnt be looking at high risk investment. unless this is extra money you can afford to let it be stuck there in the event of market downturn. 4% riskfree at 55 is pretty good,btohqsg
But at that age  how much risk can you take? If you were to invest into bonds or fixed income  you will need to take on some risk for a bit more yield,btohqsg
rental yield dont think can consistently beat 4% and not all properties get to huat from appreciation also. unless everything works out for you  4% is hard to beat,btohqsg
yes true also... 4% risk free from government (which I understand can be withdrawn ANYTIME after 55) sounds good too also la hor..but who knows what the interest rate environment will be when I am 55...,btohqsg
just hope shielding rules won't change when i'm 54 years old,btohqsg
with the popularity of shielding  i wont be surprised if it does lol,btohqsg
It is all relative I guess.If UOB One and HSBC EGA continues to keep paying 5% p.a. interest... then SA (after 55 years old) at 4% p.a. won't look attractive.,btohqsg
yep  but its unlikely AND also need to consider the fluctuation of rates. 5% for 10 years later drop to 1% after that  you will be better off not moving the money at all. very subjective movement and very one way,btohqsg
Can't believe we so fast forget the days like these:https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/uob-further-cuts-interest-rates-flagship-account,btohqsg
i think it is starting point..i am very old... i am used to interest rates being 3-4% p.a.,btohqsg
that being said  it is unlikely for US to have their baseline interest rates close to 0 ever again  in our lifetime i feel.,btohqsg
Top up MA  it’s easier to achieve and once u hit BHS  it will help your SA grow faster without having additional reserved amount lock up.,btohqsg
No its housing grant aka free money but for purposes of paying for housing only,btohqsg
maybe credited into OA for grant uses?,btohqsg
Yes the grant is credited into your OA,btohqsg
