I got sent in the A's chat before whut,btohqsg
I love Chinese still doing it even tho I finished it a year ago,btohqsg
So that ‘s why some graded assessments are shifted to e-submission.,btohqsg
The marker won’t have difficulty reading handwritings.,btohqsg
compare the top table vs the bottom tho,btohqsg
i did not care for the top,btohqsg
I realised the quality sucks but,btohqsg
Nvm I find the paper tmr if I rmb,btohqsg
conclusion is that most ours still quite easy to read,btohqsg
I can't just forward the vid cuz I think it shows my face,btohqsg
I hv my face in my pfp,btohqsg
btw  I have to teach undergrads next sem,btohqsg
What he gonna do ban me,btohqsg
You request them to submit ecopy to you.,btohqsg
sure idm  just really busy these weeks,btohqsg
it's math so most would just write then submit scans/pictures,btohqsg
It's not bad... Just painful to read LOL,btohqsg
i have legitimately seen worse than Bedok's,btohqsg
damn smart guy. i borrowed his notes cos i missed one lecture,btohqsg
eh this one is still okay,btohqsg
my revision handwriting actually quite neat,btohqsg
write properly i can absorb better,btohqsg
my revision handwriting is mood dependent ngl,btohqsg
if i feel like i wanna finish faster and toh it’ll just look like scribbles,btohqsg
can anyone reco me some good amath tuition for a sec 3 2023 student ? thanks,btohqsg
good as in like  the teacher can teach and explain the concepts really well  straightforward teaching and all that kind of stuff,btohqsg
Do the subject first then decide if u need the tuition man...,btohqsg
i definitely need tuition for amath,btohqsg
Isit Ur sch force amath type,btohqsg
is your sch one of those places where amath is compulsory for all students,btohqsg
someone help 2023 sec3s are scary,btohqsg
but i think it wld be good to have tuition for amath imo,btohqsg
have a bit more confidence in yourself,btohqsg
they don't even need to change classes bro,btohqsg
then i see my results lor,btohqsg
Pls just enjoy S2 hols now,btohqsg
If u wan I can tell u what u learn and stuff,btohqsg
wa1 what will come out for amath ah,btohqsg
idk can worry after your holidays,btohqsg
Depends on ur sch but gen is quad eqn ah surds,btohqsg
at least that was for my wa1,btohqsg
2 only got for subj comb,btohqsg
ya i feel damn sad for s4,btohqsg
Bro my sch ppl angry they remove mye for s4 early,btohqsg
i think moe removed MYE’s right,btohqsg
bc they don't want to stress us out,btohqsg
but what does it matter when freaking,btohqsg
prelims are coming in like 2-3 months,btohqsg
It's just pushing the stress ltr,btohqsg
so?? in 2-3 months i got improvement,btohqsg
dont later all of them panic at prelims.. more stress,btohqsg
But yeah@s4nc7uaryif u love maths alot ahU gonna learn abt discriminant for quadratic eqn completing the sq,btohqsg
in fact they should push mye earlier  prelim at least 1 5m bfr o's,btohqsg
Literally what happened to my cohort bro,btohqsg
Plus back in my days sounds old as fck lol,btohqsg
amath is only boring in the first semester,btohqsg
No bro I was scared shitless last time,btohqsg
trigo is when amath gets more exciting,btohqsg
while having tuition sudd i fai,btohqsg
should have specified exciting and scarier,btohqsg
I love h2 math but h2 math doesn't love me back,btohqsg
i went from 85% to 50%,btohqsg
i remember hating trigo identities to the core at first,btohqsg
sound like me and physics fr,btohqsg
One thing I would say abt amath,btohqsg
If it's in the formula sheet don't bother memorising,btohqsg
Lollll honestly i enjoy doing math sia like if i feel stressed or don't feel like studying  i do math papers because it is the most chill paper to do,btohqsg
my amath teacher actually thought me a very neat trick for finding exact values for special angles,btohqsg
amath so far me is fun,btohqsg
Wah shit black panther coming out on 12th nov i wan go sia,btohqsg
am i going to regret saying this in sec 4,btohqsg
Not the following week econ chem econ back to back,btohqsg
i feel like as long as i can do time management i can already,btohqsg
Haven't touched h2 chem in damn long,btohqsg
to complete every para at least,btohqsg
I chiong my essay like mad,btohqsg
how lomg is p geog ppr,btohqsg
Like I write damn fast for the first time,btohqsg
Like I panicked for the CMC question,btohqsg
Dist and a B for h2,btohqsg
bro sec 2 trigo is SOOO easy,btohqsg
somehow i anyhow whack my elective history paper still can get 23/50,btohqsg
sec 3 amath trigo shd be very hard right,btohqsg
Best essay I ever written ig,btohqsg
i saw a few questions about it,btohqsg
but once you understand it it becomes very easy THIS IS SUBJEXYIVE,btohqsg
My school spent 1 term on trigo  don't know how it happened,btohqsg
I rmb ya are thr for me also,btohqsg
Legit sia I don't know how it happened bruh,btohqsg
sec 2 trigo is just simple toa cah soh,btohqsg
sine/cosine graphs  trigo identies  trigo equations and whatnot,btohqsg
also you will learn about radians,btohqsg
PLEASE remember when to convert your calculator mode from degrees to radians and vice versa,btohqsg
y'all talking among yourself the sec3 also dk go where we,btohqsg
personally i find amath easier than emath bc the problems are more straightforward,btohqsg
My Cher even S2 alrd tell me pure geog times,btohqsg
sorry bcz. I don't study and give two fuck abt it FUCK GEOG LEGT RUGHEHFJDJ,btohqsg
js memorise steps  as said earlier  I don't memorise 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
Lol i always forget the paper duration and total marks and all,btohqsg
UHHH.. that's a story for another day,btohqsg
Understanding how to get to end point,btohqsg
even tdy idk how to use cosine rule,btohqsg
I cannot understand one I see I curse I cry den after ppr I buy bbt :D,btohqsg
a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A),btohqsg
Huh cosine rule is easy 😭,btohqsg
Loll i used cosine rule for physics like a math god and got dynamics wrong almost everywhere,btohqsg
ya u see  I also don't practise HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
ik it's on the formula sheet,btohqsg
Ya that's y I damn confused,btohqsg
problem is i keep forgetting what to sub in,btohqsg
lmao maybe resolved angle wrong somewhere or smth,btohqsg
For me I rmb it as the sandwich thing,btohqsg
lost like 15 marks in my eoy because of cosine rule,btohqsg
Idk how to explain via text,btohqsg
Angle a betw line b and c,btohqsg
your dma alr tell you sleep a,btohqsg
B and c the position don't matter,btohqsg
that how I do it ah,btohqsg
(i was going to say i don't like congruency tests but i remembered amath also has geometrical proofs but on steroids),btohqsg
Or if u cannot must si bei,btohqsg
Cuz I like to visualise stuff,btohqsg
this year paper geometry not fun,btohqsg
bc  i forgor what the valid congruency tests are alr,btohqsg
Maybe I'll die next yr tho,btohqsg
I at first cock eye see wrong,btohqsg
good luck to you  you're on your own,btohqsg
I have to visualise and draw sia,btohqsg
Skip part i then cannot do part ii because part ii need part i then skip whole question. 20 marks gone,btohqsg
I kena for internal paper sia wah,btohqsg
I skip skip then before i know it 20 marks blank bruh then i had to actually start doing,btohqsg
i can even take furthest math,btohqsg
you want a photo of my PhD cert ?,btohqsg
Who needs bitches when you have chem,btohqsg
For me who needs bitches when you have history,btohqsg
OMG I LOVE HISTORY BEEN STUDYING FOR IT SINCE THE START OF YEAR LOVE IT 😍😍😍,btohqsg
the only 2 genders you know are RS right,btohqsg
What does RS and ez stand for??,btohqsg
LOL i forgot how to spell the full form sia,btohqsg
in sec2  i forgot what electronic configuration means,btohqsg
for left and right or clockwise anticlockwise,btohqsg
oh wait you already know right@kohsyan,btohqsg
His address isHelicopter flying underwater AVE 193902 #1000-26299,btohqsg
funny thing is  the 3 chemist were all british or sth but they named it in german,btohqsg
wah im amazed that i understood it without h2 physics sia,btohqsg
you know the opening of my house door is calledBill Gates,btohqsg
quantum tunneling isn't hard to understand conceptually,btohqsg
my chinese name is tee foo,btohqsg
lmao guessing a wavefunction is so common even now,btohqsg
like even my uni stuff also did it a lot,btohqsg
it's like you got a weird quantum state and there's no exact wavefunction we know,btohqsg
so you guess something similar and see how the additional parts change the wavefunction,btohqsg
tbh it's like you take Taylor expansion but with quantum states,btohqsg
it's ok when I need it now  i just use mathematica,btohqsg
why would i not give you the formula? in real life problems you aren't gonna be forced into a room with just your pen and paper,btohqsg
then he also say he won't deduct marks for like negative sign,btohqsg
anything that involves memorise and vomiting isn't a good subject to me,btohqsg
my friends and i proclaimed to my bio cher then we would all get A for A's and have the last laugh 💀💀💀,btohqsg
so now we have to live up to our words,btohqsg
if you look at my A level cert  you'll see a very nice E for H1 Geog,btohqsg
I'm surprised I didn't fail anything in As tbh,btohqsg
oh ye actually i got my result slip but never collected my cert,btohqsg
cos I was in NS then annoying to go down,btohqsg
i thought got digital copy now or ?,btohqsg
eh i heard got some cases the school sends it to the NS camp or sth,btohqsg
last time I just scanned my results slip,btohqsg
anyway my A level cert no use now,btohqsg
i want that 1 day book out to collect,btohqsg
my sec2 camp at sarimbun the whole time i thought i was in malaysia sia,btohqsg
i dont even remember my JC days,btohqsg
and all the expectations to live up to,btohqsg
dri fit NTU t shirt + shorts + flip flop,btohqsg
imagine going to law sch in singlet and shorts,btohqsg
bro physics lab also need long pants but like,btohqsg
what are you protecting me from,btohqsg
in shows  those guys are the top top people sia,btohqsg
what are people like me in stem then,btohqsg
ironically  during undergrad I always wear jeans to class,btohqsg
but when TA must be more presentable,btohqsg
other than the shirt  that's almost every guy,btohqsg
my Ta dont even show up to class,btohqsg
Im wearing the red shirt in my pfp,btohqsg
i have a million NTU shirts,btohqsg
i don't wear them to class tho,btohqsg
I hv 1 colour of every basic ntu shirt,btohqsg
I can only hook you up with SPMS shirts,btohqsg
sure  next time when they have ba,btohqsg
Hook a brudder up with some sexy sexy spms shirts,btohqsg
I think it means they can just fuck off to another country?,btohqsg
yo i didnt even need to know how he looks like to know its him,btohqsg
i thought occupationally mobile is when,btohqsg
Just means no real commitment to stay?,btohqsg
u can change jobs coz ure higher skilled,btohqsg
is it they have more incentives to leave the country,btohqsg
is just poor phrasing essentially is just brain drain,btohqsg
just scream ilovecambridge and u can get admitted alr,btohqsg
man idk why i spent my Sat night here when i've a fuck ton of work to do,btohqsg
i think the phrasing damn bad and lacking sia,btohqsg
everyday i cry to myself over the fact that i chose trip sci over econs,btohqsg
prob need to add on more,btohqsg
my uni econs notes r no better,btohqsg
Wait wlao why u studying econs at 12.15,btohqsg
i'm gonna work on my presentation lol,btohqsg
I alr conceded that my sat is my recharge day,btohqsg
is sgexams discord still a thing ?,btohqsg
i have 3 papers next week and i did the same so,btohqsg
its okay i’ve been grinding physics  until now,btohqsg
like legit in 1 day finish phy p2 and p3,btohqsg
damn i was hoping i could do all night grind in a channel,btohqsg
best part i suck at all 3 subj,btohqsg
i haz a phy quiz and a cc mod quiz next week and i havent done anything on sat :>,btohqsg
eh walao i doing that now sia,btohqsg
this is what I did today,btohqsg
but i eventually pushed myself to do it!!!!,btohqsg
bouldering in the morning  eat buffet for lunch  toh until dinner,btohqsg
push me to finish my 2 2.5k words essay 1 research paper and prep for 2 quizzes,btohqsg
push me to do my presentation  another presentation to present to supervisor  and 2 assignments,btohqsg
anyways econs people which sch’s econs papers are gd to practice ah,btohqsg
im h1 but idt it makes a diff,btohqsg
and im failing the crap out of this shit LOL,btohqsg
ive been here for 4 years,btohqsg
how bad are the CC mods,btohqsg
In resume j dont put gpa,btohqsg
i rather waste time failing physics than waste time failing cc mods,btohqsg
i think i been here for 4 alr iirc,btohqsg
I joined and left a few times,btohqsg
i just didn't talk LOL because i didn't take Os then some shit i said just confused people so i stopped talking,btohqsg
thank me for tanking 02 bellcurve for quiz 1 and upcoming quiz 2,btohqsg
none of u were here when this grp had 100 people,btohqsg
School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in NTU,btohqsg
yall never saw the big bang,btohqsg
confirm lower than whatever you got,btohqsg
EH IK U FROM WHR AGN,btohqsg
yall never go thru the chanric wars oso,btohqsg
my experience told me that whenever someone says this  they really mean it and it is actually true,btohqsg
it's ok i went through the wars in person,btohqsg
I got a flat B lol,btohqsg
Oh uni got actual bellcurve right,btohqsg
Lowest i hv seen is a C,btohqsg
i heard SUTD no bellcurve? Can someone confirm,btohqsg
I open ntulearn and its red,btohqsg
profs can do whatever they want,btohqsg
Now help tank cc1 and ml4,btohqsg
im only taking cc1 next sem tho,btohqsg
my 4 years is one big subject,btohqsg
IM TAKING 1 3 5 NEXT SEM,btohqsg
one time my prof nvr bellcurve,btohqsg
20% of the cohort got an F,btohqsg
I think those are what they are called,btohqsg
and so must assume is normal distribution!!!,btohqsg
I taking 3 n 5 as well,btohqsg
im dreading stats now i have to take it next sem,btohqsg
ive forgotten everything about stats now i have to relearn everything,btohqsg
i dropping out to pursue my own dreams,btohqsg
Is like pw but on crack,btohqsg
still haven't show his PhD cert,btohqsg
everything is an L mod :(((((((((((,btohqsg
Just curious  uk a prof called Kenneth hong? From nus,btohqsg
Cries in finals coming in 3 weeks,btohqsg
looking at his research last time,btohqsg
He is my spho trainer lol,btohqsg
"I asked him a ""prof will u rmbr me in the future""He said yes!!!",btohqsg
is it normal to have a paper straight away after week 13,btohqsg
or is spms just cruel to me,btohqsg
i can show you my bag,btohqsg
my PhD supervisor used to teach at a JC when I was in JC lol,btohqsg
some of my friends know him,btohqsg
coincidentally my trainer is @/yomosprof lol - for some mods,btohqsg
always curious as to why some phd people teach at govt jcs,btohqsg
you asking me out in a group chat ah,btohqsg
damn...non zero chance I might TA you if so,btohqsg
its okay we can just buy 800MHz mmr stupid wtv yall call it,btohqsg
anyway my supervisor you probs won't be taught by until like year 4 if you take his mod haha,btohqsg
cb i wanna eat hotpot now alr sia,btohqsg
he used to teach a y2 mod,btohqsg
i don't like to be chased  i like to chase,btohqsg
ohhhhh oof okay oops elbert did fit that description,btohqsg
BUT NO LATE NIGHT SUPPER FOR ME,btohqsg
anyway if i say who my supervisor is  i legit doxxing my entire self LOL,btohqsg
If yall know what it is,btohqsg
you'll only doxx yourself to those in spms LOL,btohqsg
parkway one u tell me date i see if can,btohqsg
parkway is like so near my house,btohqsg
guys um if lets say the question ask to describe what the components of current account arecan just say balance of trade (X-M) = export revenue - import expenditureand imports + exports of services horhbalance of trade automatically means imports + exports of goods right??,btohqsg
u go find him at parkwy liho,btohqsg
X > M or like X < M,btohqsg
PLS FACT CHECK FOR ME BEDOK I DONT TAKE H2 ECONS,btohqsg
i thought that one is ur BOP,btohqsg
I ONLY KNOW TRADE DEFICIT AND TRADE SURPLUS,btohqsg
o level econs never teach capital and financial account,btohqsg
ok but if its h2 how would u say leh,btohqsg
Just some baileys/moscato/and trace amys of soju,btohqsg
i only know briefly stuff abt BOT man cos h1 doesnt teach bot,btohqsg
guys this is getting spammy imma have to ask yall to go to the chatroom instead,btohqsg
its like ur budget deficit kinda thing right,btohqsg
current account is payment for imports and exports  primary income and current transfers,btohqsg
just that now its export vs import,btohqsg
budget deficit is government expenditure and revenue isnt it???? HUH,btohqsg
when i read up on trade deficit its also like expenditure vs revenue,btohqsg
budget deficit occurs when govt expenditure exceeds the tax revenue,btohqsg
idk whats going on in the invisible current acc,btohqsg
yeah but i think irs different,btohqsg
visible is for goodsinvisible for services...,btohqsg
yea i know but when i see deficit i usually think of expenditure vs revenue ig,btohqsg
trade deficit is import expenditure is greater than exports revenue assuming initially equilibrium,btohqsg
but mon i got council meeting,btohqsg
eh but this monday i not gg,btohqsg
okay yay i learnt the correct stuff,btohqsg
