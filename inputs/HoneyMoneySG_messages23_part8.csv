Have a slightly silly questionI just realised that spend on UOB PPV card does not qualify for the $500 spend for higher interest in UOB One Account.Can I then pay my UOB PPV credit card bill using my UOB One Debit Card (which qualifies for higher interest)?,btohqsg
Not that there's a way I know of,btohqsg
Hmm  apparently can pay through ATM machine. Will check and update haha,btohqsg
good luck! hope that works. will probably not count as eligible spend though,btohqsg
Pretty sure they won't count it as eligible  if not they would have just allowed all their cards to be eligible in the first place ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…From what I see  credit card payments usually always by giro or bank transfer. But hopefully ur atm hack would work out!,btohqsg
"Haha  fair point. Sigh  will probably have to get one of their ""allowed"" cards then",btohqsg

For sharing  I went into my GXS app  seems like itâ€™s open( at least for me),btohqsg
Quick q. Anyone knows which CC to use for Telco payments?DBS category in app showing up as Bills  Utilities and Taxes.,btohqsg

for me i pay my insurances with the debit card. since they dont usually get any rewards/points anyway. or even go thru cardup and all  need service fee. so learnt to let go of optimizing insurance for points lol,btohqsg

Hi sifus  anyone of you use GxS? Currently iâ€™m using it and save the money into Saving Pocket and earning 3.48% pa. And the interest is paying everyday! Is there any max amount to earn the interest for this saving pocket?,btohqsg
Hi sifu  if my yearly employer cpf contribution is $37740. Can I still top up 8k to my MA or SA for tax relief?,btohqsg
I just signed up for it  just got approvedStill playing ard w it3.48% is a lot man,btohqsg

Like grab wallet but it separate main and saving wallet,btohqsg
Seems like thereâ€™s some grab points also can link to the account.But I donâ€™t see it on grab app,btohqsg

To add  it is provided you haven't hit FRS of 192k for SA / BRS of 66k for MA,btohqsg
