I definitely first heard it in a racing game just cannot remember which,btohqsg
Technically now you install meth  it's almost like nos,btohqsg
First time i actually knew what a turbo was is GT1,btohqsg
and LTA havent banned Meth yet right,btohqsg
And also exposed to the fact that NA car bhp ceiling is SO much lower than FI,btohqsg
first time i know anything was initial D,btohqsg
the anime did teach alot of stuff,btohqsg

It was the ageeeenttttt she say turbo more faster my dad instant nono🤣😭,btohqsg
My mom wanted to get the turbo too,btohqsg
turbo save petrol she shd say,btohqsg
But my 2 sisters said it's too expensive for 1 turbo,btohqsg
Nowadays EV so powerful  petrol cars are below average,btohqsg
Add a turbo to help the car slightly.,btohqsg
Plus the car heavy.. need the help of the turbo,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21also good  but not same level,btohqsg
i told my mom  1.5L cheaper road tax  saves fuel  gets more power.,btohqsg
U cannot only look at taycan and model s lah. U must also consider byd e6 and nissan leaf,btohqsg
comes with blindspot monitoring and camera and more air bags,btohqsg
In the end every powertrain also can be weak or strong,btohqsg
Then my mom say sounds like a good deal,btohqsg
But my sis say it's useless. You don't buy a car to crash  why care about airbags,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21this is what research gets you,btohqsg
Counter the agent ma. Anything to confuse anybody works. xP,btohqsg
But end up my mom also bought the 1.6L cos of my 2 sisters,btohqsg

@PilotAviator21tell them you found a 1.3L 4 door low depreciation car that still have enough power to carry a family,btohqsg
The saddest thing is my mom traded in the MX5 for that 1.6,btohqsg
And didn't even choose 1.5T to make the car better,btohqsg

But if u hold too long cat will die,btohqsg
But sepang is full throttle one sia,btohqsg

You 0808 nv meet us see his wheel gap,btohqsg

If not i'll be fisting the suv liao,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21have you checked if your speed tele?,btohqsg
Just recovered. Go back office damn shag,btohqsg
"you took a long ""break"" somemore",btohqsg
Suppose work from home today. But manager say  ok today lets all have meeting in office,btohqsg
she 2 weeks never see us liao,btohqsg
she know's work from home is actually just watch netflix and play game,btohqsg
LOL. I think she also know la. Just that as long as work gets done  she dont care,btohqsg
ok la  i see my bumper still quite ok,btohqsg
I just hope i allocate enough,btohqsg
I might just leave the stone chips,btohqsg
you know like those le mans race car they win alr then don't wash the car,btohqsg
with all the damage and dirt on it,btohqsg
new tyres  oil change  brake pads,btohqsg
My first track day is a legit reason to keep the scars,btohqsg
to see if his dash speed is the same as waze,btohqsg
because he's gona change tyre size when he change rims  so his speedo will also be affected,btohqsg
but wont be much of a diff one,btohqsg
"17"" go with 45 just nice",btohqsg
If y’all wna see diff u can always checkhttps://tiresize.com/comparison/,btohqsg
if only you can tell him the exact specs he should go for,btohqsg
https://www.willtheyfit.com/I normally use this. Cos this one got offset and stretch,btohqsg
He never ask me he only give me size HAHA,btohqsg
i don't trust the size he give,btohqsg
but speedo run is small issue la,btohqsg
A lot of ppl have speedo run,btohqsg
Most important is don’t rub anything,btohqsg
no la  just dont pass speed limit,btohqsg
you sibei scared  you see camera just go 10kmh below limit,btohqsg
small device wire in  then can offset,btohqsg
OEM tyres very hard to find,btohqsg
half the ppl here all run with diff speedo,btohqsg
at most also 5kmh or so nia,btohqsg
this kind of stupid size how to find sia,btohqsg
mx5 i dont even know the stock tyres is what size,btohqsg
hahaha i also just run 215/45,btohqsg
maybe i'm going 225/45 soon also,btohqsg
so what size you plan to change,btohqsg
But I want to see the rim first leh,btohqsg
Then u guys say change the profile to lower as its thick then 40 will be too low so 215 45🤣,btohqsg
then what you want to change to,btohqsg
The coil over haven’t yet right,btohqsg
U better change tyre + rim first later rub,btohqsg
What ur car model n year again forget year sry HAHA,btohqsg
I mean I know a lot of ppl,btohqsg
Half say before half say after,btohqsg
All ask me do coils first 🤪,btohqsg
And Roi say the rims might go im,btohqsg
Cos you change coilsovers already  you still will change rims in the future,btohqsg
Ok lor u tyre kena not my fault ok,btohqsg
No la i not going so low,btohqsg
Atmost 2 finger or 1.5 finger only,btohqsg
you go across bumps or humps will still rub,btohqsg
So if i change rims before coils double change rims,btohqsg
No ah  the logic to change rims before coils is so that you can adjust your coilovers to your rim to not rub,btohqsg
Now alr my sus so soft u can ask@ANBU_ARASAN,btohqsg
But when you change rims again  you still gonna adjust your coilovers again,btohqsg
Hmmm but wont make a diff mah since same 17 inch,btohqsg
So either way  no matter what you do you still will adjust coilovers again,btohqsg
If he never offset it shouldnt be an issue,btohqsg
But either way is the difference is a trip down to fongkim and ask them to adjust height,btohqsg
I just find the logic of you should change rims before change coilovers a bit no link,btohqsg
cos it sounds like after you change coilovers  you cannot change rims anymore?,btohqsg
When it's not supposed to be the case,btohqsg
So yes  no diff  just do what you want,btohqsg
8 35 maybe not so bad,btohqsg
U can either one 1st...best is to do tgt,btohqsg
If you gonna do both at same time  then yes wheels on first then go do coilovers,btohqsg
if you're saving money to do either 1 first,btohqsg
On the same day i got to Cordilla then go to Fong Kim,btohqsg
My own logic is do coils then wheels so can go wider wheels for clout 🤐🤐🤐,btohqsg
Bring the rims n tires to Fong kim,btohqsg
Lowered car on stock rims > aftermarket rims on stock ride height,btohqsg
Low car stock wheels > stock car aftermarket wheels,btohqsg
This is why COILOVERS FIRST LA,btohqsg
Some stock wheels look extremely good when lowered 😅,btohqsg
Especially this new Gen of Mazda’s HAHA,btohqsg
some car's stock rims not ugly one,btohqsg
Hello have u seen 1.6 stock rims,btohqsg
i wanted to change rims for her free  also kena kan,btohqsg
so i can't be arsed alr,btohqsg
But u wan thinner den go 18inch better,btohqsg
forged 18 got so light meh,btohqsg
replica 16 now also cao cao 7kg one leh,btohqsg
branded 16s can hit 5 to 6kg,btohqsg
Those original RPF1 or TE37 then knn light  cfm 5+,btohqsg
Lol..more toward rays and ssr and spoon,btohqsg
i want advan but so knn ex,btohqsg
"15"" options for rims much inexpensive than bigger sizes",btohqsg
I'll just aim for rays lightgram,btohqsg
Anyone follow athrider? His 16in 5kg nia power,btohqsg
Yeah v nice cuz he stay jb,btohqsg
Lolx..I dun go JB for car needs 😁,btohqsg

Firm believer in support the local bois,btohqsg
Lolx...track focused one...me driving on streets,btohqsg
I need a street focused type😁,btohqsg
Very hard to upkeep the pristine look,btohqsg
It is a brand if I remb correctly,btohqsg
I may try but nw lazy hahah,btohqsg
Looks cool but I dun like the dirty look after 2weeks,btohqsg
Looks really ugly when it is dirty,btohqsg
Car look clean but tires looks dirty...not something that is I am into,btohqsg
Ok thanks den i better nt hahaha,btohqsg
I alr no more spare rims,btohqsg
If i know him at that time i cfm give him free,btohqsg
With ultra thin tire profile 😁,btohqsg
He need a spinning snail or 2 in his engine bay😂,btohqsg
Just put black tape on the rims la hahahha,btohqsg
Unlimited design... Can buy many plastic cover  everyday different rims,btohqsg
More aerodynamic... Shit la  how much more only... Negligible oso,btohqsg
Ya but cuz range alr low,btohqsg
U see the handle also flush with car body,btohqsg
I was all for evs thinking car manafacturers would use the oppertunity to make cars like this but😂😂 haiya forgot its all about consumer styling now,btohqsg
Probably can add 100m more in range,btohqsg
I buy hot wheels for u,btohqsg
Last time i keep looking for one,btohqsg
I got space to put small car models on my dashboard,btohqsg
That small gonna bring to the left dashboard area,btohqsg
I'm like since when u a poet,btohqsg
Eh really hard to find this size ah ?,btohqsg
Siao liao. Im on this spec,btohqsg
Re004 though. I just scared they stop bringing it in.,btohqsg
but most fit i know they using 205/50/16,btohqsg
Yeah. Quite common size. But i heard also will bua fenders quite abit without camber.,btohqsg
If you take small offset cfm will bua,btohqsg
Today 15th please don’t rev too loud ah guys 😁😁,btohqsg

Few days after the decathlon meet i was ambushed at my cp,btohqsg
U try lip let me know details 🤪🤪,btohqsg
Means lta see video  track car plate and wait at your cp ?,btohqsg
Who knows what source they used but yea  they know u participated  basically,btohqsg
And the logic is participants to such events *usually* got mod,btohqsg
That day I went decathlon after Jurong hill,btohqsg
Stand beside my friends car but never tio any paper,btohqsg
They catch a grp of civic,btohqsg
go to meetup place and go cp ambush is different sia,btohqsg
I only had 2 bikes at my cp,btohqsg
But is for me only la,btohqsg
Actually they wanna escort you to work...,btohqsg
They were standing in front of chloe,btohqsg
You never OI them from far,btohqsg
sorry sir  didnt know you were lta,btohqsg
i thought stranger wanna break in or something,btohqsg
if car nothing wrong  just have a chat,btohqsg
They bring 4 wheels to match my 4 wheels  must give respect,btohqsg
Ya actually never do anything illegal is just a social visit liao,btohqsg
"I wonder if they really have the so call ""quota"" anot",btohqsg
Life as stock car is very easygoing,btohqsg
i go exhaust repair inspection  also there just having a chat with the lta feller,btohqsg
Deterrence and enforcement are their kpi,btohqsg
just nice one lambo go for inspection  so i ask how that car can pass all that,btohqsg
It’s abit contradicting to have a min quota,btohqsg
If they never catch it could be a good year due successful deterrence campaigns,btohqsg
Nxt time we leave our car at hme..all take blue sg go..Lol,btohqsg
Make the woo woo bluesg sound louder,btohqsg
from 100m away can hear woooo woooo,btohqsg
Become spotter ..sit onside eat popcorn,btohqsg
we sit by a traffic light  then with camera and flash,btohqsg
Mai siao siao hor bro blue sg is fastest car in sg,btohqsg
my friend was alot paya lebar there in the morning,btohqsg
i got spare cam and flash for you to use,btohqsg
car over take him and want to turn right. kena 2 flash,btohqsg
Lambo see blue sg also siam,btohqsg
see if i still got his video anot,btohqsg
lambo too ex to do stupid things,btohqsg
he kena because he turn from wrong lane,btohqsg
This probably happen when the gf beside keep nagging “turn turn turn u can turn”,btohqsg
don't know can appeal or not because he turned,btohqsg
Cannot be wife cause if wife is u turn now “Orh” immediately turn Liao  again speaking from experience,btohqsg
"Dont know if kena flash because turn right or because cross line for the lane going straight hence ""beat red light""",btohqsg
if go straight is 100% kena,btohqsg
should be because cross the line going straight,btohqsg
There is a separate offense for turning from wrong lane,btohqsg
And he will get hit with that,btohqsg
Thats why the RLC takes 2 photos,btohqsg
probably will pick that over the red light,btohqsg
To observe the attitude of the car in the second hot,btohqsg
kena the right turn one better la,btohqsg
He wont get to pick  its literally his offence,btohqsg
if kena beat red light + right turn,btohqsg
Then no need to say already.,btohqsg
So his offense is turn from wrong lane,btohqsg
turn right wrong lane how many points and fine ?,btohqsg
Not sure  i nv eat that before,btohqsg
this like some advance theory test,btohqsg
4 point if im not wrong,btohqsg
you see snap so many time,btohqsg
they wanna see where he go,btohqsg
turn from wrong lane idk if it's an offence or not,btohqsg
Yes  making a turn from a straight ahead only lane,btohqsg
Likewise going straight on a turning only lane,btohqsg
if there is such a clause,btohqsg
but he can always argue he changing lane,btohqsg
i rmb seeing a video  the guy turn right on the go straight lane  den he oso run red light den kena flash,btohqsg
its to see where your wheel is at the red light,btohqsg
ya but he nv cross to the other side,btohqsg
Fyi if ur first and second shot ur car didnt move,btohqsg
so he didn't beat red light,btohqsg
Congrats u only get “failed to stop at white line”,btohqsg
U dont have to make it to the other side,btohqsg
Btw stop in yellow box is also an offense ya,btohqsg
as long your back wheel pass the line  kena,btohqsg
But you dont get run red light,btohqsg
Stop in yellow box is also serious,btohqsg
If u stop in yellow box u instant fail driving test,btohqsg
I don’t remember how many points tho.,btohqsg
Same one ba. I shared in the other group. haha,btohqsg
He didn't beat redlight  cos he turned right. Got arrow,btohqsg
got  camera flash cos he turn on the go straight lane,btohqsg
Yes the camera flashed and it will show him turning from wrong lane.,btohqsg
First shot cross line second shot right turn,btohqsg
That's why i keep saying got 2 flash  first flash is see you cross  2nd flash is see you got reach other side or not,btohqsg
Offence = failure to form up for turn,btohqsg
Later he argue  no car form up for what. LOL,btohqsg
my friend kena flash before but didn't go other side,btohqsg
If im not wrong even u in yellow box facing straight is still kena,btohqsg
He might be lucky that day is dummy cam,btohqsg
he kena stop in yellow box,btohqsg
This always reminds me of my office exit leh,btohqsg
My friend he is cannot brake in time,btohqsg
he cross the line then stop in yellow box,btohqsg
then he kena stop in yellow box,btohqsg
kena highway before  speed limit was 90  i travelling 86  go pass kena flash  but nothing,btohqsg
Lane 1 always queue up  lane 2 always free flowing traffic,btohqsg
if you exit from the car park  you have to turn into yellow box,btohqsg
because if 1 car will hold up 2 lanes,btohqsg
the yellow box is made for you to turn in,btohqsg
heng i everytime exit there  no car,btohqsg
1 car can hold lane 2 from moving also lol,btohqsg
I 77 on pie and the cam flash,btohqsg
they say it flash to warm up the system,btohqsg
Warm up our heart rate also,btohqsg
then after that go home view dash cam many many times,btohqsg
liddat later heart rate get even hotter,btohqsg
i just forget abt it and wait for letter.... end up no letter,btohqsg
i also that time at kallang mrt to geylang,btohqsg
lucky is the van behind me kena,btohqsg
