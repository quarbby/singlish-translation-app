idk im in comp sci n there are mods which are matha,btohqsg
like straight up feels like h2 maths,btohqsg
I don’t mind but I’m not good at it in a sense I understand basics but erm,btohqsg
i feel like whichever u take  as long as ur open minded n willing to learn,btohqsg
u can do well  i know alot of friends in my course that never learnt programming,btohqsg
but we all learn and grow and they r doing quite well,btohqsg
I hope my olvl score can get in first,btohqsg
Is it like quite male dominated,btohqsg
theres quite some jc kids that didnt take h2 computing that came info my course  some willing to learn  some who just keep asking for answers  so yea,btohqsg
it depends on perspective but looking at statistics yes but im a girl so,btohqsg
I thot they say h2 computing useless?,btohqsg
not sure some of the things i learn in UOL does start h2 comp from scratch ah,btohqsg
I do h2 computing so i know i will die in the first week of comsci,btohqsg
its useless in a sense people can learn just from uni  but not useless if u consider that you get to see a perspectice of how computing is,btohqsg
Cant even do linked list fml,btohqsg
haha i was in h2 comp  got a C for A's but i went to sim uol  so not sure if it counts,btohqsg
Me looking at chat be like : 👁️👄👁️,btohqsg
but so far ive gotten A's for all mg mods in sem 1,btohqsg
so i dont think youll die if the uni u go to is more,btohqsg
I always felt q hard to do well in computing unless u started from young tbh,btohqsg
its honestly just how we are taught,btohqsg
cuz h2 comp youre still memorising things,btohqsg
but once ur in uni (once agn from my own sch experience  not sure if its the same) they actually give yoi like reasoning,btohqsg
i mean if u do want to see what i learn i can dm u some things i do,btohqsg
because when u write on paper,btohqsg
but ok la h2 computing is eay more rigid i guess,btohqsg
ok maybe if ur going ntu nus,btohqsg
idk but like for my sch they dont really care they start from basics,btohqsg
at least its not a levels :D,btohqsg
i mean dont follow me im like,btohqsg
Idk why my ankles felt so sore,btohqsg
the worst example of an a level student LOL i graduated tho so,btohqsg
bruh u want the scariest jc for h2 computing,btohqsg
u can see our face drop the moment we see dhs and rv,btohqsg
cuz theirs is really really high standard qn,btohqsg
like its rly rly tough but trains u to see questions more indepth,btohqsg
All i learnt is that i cant do programming and shdnt do comsci,btohqsg
so we like looking at fhen qns,btohqsg
hahaha comp sci in SIM UOL is fun,btohqsg
so i can't really complain anything abt my course,btohqsg
Hahaha no la  my school Collab with DHS before so I got friends there... The teachers are very welcoming and the principal is very supportinggg,btohqsg
Oh ur in sec sxh haha?,btohqsg
How can price be half half,btohqsg
like its expensive compared to local  cheaper compared to priv,btohqsg
Yea i doubt whether i can even afford local so i guess not an option for me,btohqsg
n i rather focuz on only maths n programming compared to focusing on 5 subjects,btohqsg
so i rejected the accepted appeal to retake cuz the uni accepted me,btohqsg
wait who was the person who talked about the part time job for banquets ah,btohqsg
