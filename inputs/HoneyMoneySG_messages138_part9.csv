"Yup for some reason/hack. Its not possible to search that ""person""",btohqsg
Hahaha atm klook. Beside travel booking  i use it for movies  sistic shows etc. After that  grab + tada.Id avoid shopee voucher as i personally had bad experience with that. Like voucher cannot be used to buy apple product üòÇ. Heymax side refunded but that made my experience bad.,btohqsg

Cant seem to get a hold of how the daily balance works for OCBC.. how to make it $500 ah i transfered in some amount some time ago but its not going to $500  any tips?,btohqsg
I thought about this. I aborted why.Because if u use Klook vouchers. The entire booking cannot earn ShopBack or max miles Liao.So end up is weaker. U earn 6mpd on the vouchers and your booking even if u pay balance with Uob lady card. You still earn 6mpd on the booking.But if u use Uob lady card only. U can stack with ShopBack 2-8% (see what activity) and get 6mpd with Uob lady.Correct?,btohqsg
If you count 50$ interest for 500$ spend  it's 10% cashback guaranteed and 6mpd  no need for wait for promo rate.,btohqsg
What is $50 interest for $500 spend??,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 0.6% pa for 100k balance. Ocbc rewards 6mpd alone is not worth. Together with ocbc 360 saving account is pretty decent tbh.,btohqsg
OIC. Hmm. Ok I am not sure if high yield savings account bonus interest should be used for spending earn calculations.,btohqsg
Back track a little  the original context is which cc to hit ocbc 360 acc spend requirement. Hence  I shared how I used ocbc rewards.I happened to park ard 97k balance in ocbc 360 acct so it worked out well for me.,btohqsg
You need to top-up $578 and maintain the whole balance for tomorrow and 31 Oct.,btohqsg
Hahaha ok ok I joined in halfway.,btohqsg
But klook alone  ur method combining with shopback or shop with max is good choice too.,btohqsg
Without much info of your account balance  I suggest dumping $1550 into your account within 18 hours if you have $100k in OCBC 360 n aim for 4.65% interest. You don‚Äôt have much time left. Time is running out‚Ä¶‚è∞,btohqsg
hi does anyone know which BNPL platforms are eligible for both UOB ONE savings acc + UOB one credit card?,btohqsg
Is airbnb an eligible spend for uob lady card‚Äôs under travel category ?,btohqsg
I tried to open a ega account at HSBC but wasn't aware that they need the physical nric. Assuming if I can't open am account by tomorrow and I need to reset my ocbc account  could the gurus advise where could I park the money for the next one month and should I actually withdraw the money less 3k in my ocbc account please?,btohqsg
Hi all  I am about to do my Lasik soon at Eagle Eye Centre. Wanted to check if anyone has any advice on how to maximise the miles or have done that before,btohqsg
All in will probably be 4.5K?,btohqsg
If I use amaze paired with uob lady‚Äôs card on airbnb‚Ä¶ will it still be an eligible spend under travel ? Actually I don‚Äôt even need the points  I just want a better exchange rate instead of using uob card directly.,btohqsg
Amaze transactions stopped giving rewards for UOB cards since 1 Oct.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm aware of that.. I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs better to use the uob lady‚Äôs card on airbnb or pair it with amaze for better exchange rate.The airbnb is in Europe  so the base currency should be in eur.,btohqsg
If you use UOB lady + amaze  may as well use trust cashback for better rate and 1% cashback üòõAnyway  UOB lady with fcy charge on aorbnb is still worth it with 4mpd earned.Btw  can u set currency to sgd instead and see if it's better?,btohqsg
Never use amaze with Uob anymore. It‚Äôs never worth it,btohqsg
Hi all  to check for uob lady card's beauty and wellness category  is TCM such as tui na inclusive?,btohqsg
Pair with Amaze is +2%ish rates without rewards  while charge directly to UOB Lady is 3.25% FX fee + whatever FX rate UOB decides to give  but with rewards.,btohqsg
Thanks for your insight! Will change to sgd and see what is Airbnb‚Äôs fx spread and whether it‚Äôs worth it.Too bad I don‚Äôt have trust card!,btohqsg
Actually is a flat 1.45% ish difference vs the Uob earn rate.Amaze = 1.8% + Mastercard rateUob = 3.25% + Mastercard rate,btohqsg
If the airbnb cost is sgd 1234  I‚Äôm paying extra sgd 17.89 .. but get 4936 miles (4 mpd) ? I‚Äôve the lady‚Äôs account too.. so should be 6-8 miles right ?,btohqsg
Analysing which card is more worth it is killing my brain cells ü´†ü´†üòÇ,btohqsg
No need think.Confirm is naked Uob lady card.,btohqsg
Can u change currency to sgd instead and tell us the price? Then it only costs 1% more (DCC) with UOB lady.,btohqsg
i am a student need tips on how to save money. like where to put the spare cash etc,btohqsg
Sgd 1251.3 vs eur 856.18‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm paying an extra of sgd 25.71 compared to interbank rate,btohqsg
Ok so 1281.93 sgd if using naked uob lady in eur vs 1263.8 sgd using naked uob lady in sgd with 1% dcc.,btohqsg
Now the question is  should I pay on airbnb in sgd  or pay in eur and let uob bank convert ?,btohqsg
If this is from uob  I‚Äôve to pay sgd 1281.93.The better option is to change the price on airbnb to sgd and pay sgd 1251.3.. right ?,btohqsg
Yes pay in sgd in airbnb,btohqsg
Thank you for analysing this with me !!,btohqsg
So setting the currency in airbnb is still better,btohqsg
Hi sorry for the late msg  I‚Äôm heading to Japan and would like to maximize earnings for miles while overseas. Is the pairing of amaze + Citi rewards the best option? Eg (payment for rental of car etc),btohqsg
car rental is travel related. excluded from citi rewards,btohqsg
I‚Äôm being charged 1% more CCY on Citi premier miles card on airtickets and hotel bookings which I think it‚Äôs alright.Is there any other lower CCY or is this the lower since I keep reading here on 3% or 3.25%,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC excludes medical  dental  ophthalmology etc.At such  I usually charged it to Citi premier miles to get 1.2 miles locally or look at all other cashback options on those cards you have.,btohqsg
not true lah. Amaze+CRMC do get 4mpd if not hospital mcc,btohqsg
what is the DCC conversion rate?,btohqsg
May I know is it all UOB card can be use,btohqsg
Best card for Japan is actually Uob visa signature in my opinion.,btohqsg
UserRaymondhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:best to use official uob announcement than another creator‚Äôs article,btohqsg
DCA  just keep on buying every month 1.5k CPSX the return is better than accumulation in OA?As now i am using OA to pay my mortgage HDB,btohqsg
