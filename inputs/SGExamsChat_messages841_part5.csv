how do I convert NUS High grades to O-Level grades for use in poly applications?,btohqsg
"m1 has circles lifestarhub has giga & eight mobilesingtel has gomo & heyatuas limited has simbathe only difference is that giga and gomo plans are much pricier than their counterparts (eight mobile & heya)simba's plans and coverage functions similarly to eight mobile and heya because they're known to be more ""affordable"" instead of the ""speedy internet quality""",btohqsg
i don't think it's possible to convert NUS High grades to the normal grading system often used for A/N/O levelscause it makes use of the IP (International Programme) syllabus instead  by completing a 6-year(?) IP education in maybe NUS Hugh for example-- you need to check the various prerequisites firstthis can usually be found in the polytechnic school websites or on the NUS websitelink:NUS High Diploma to Polytechnic Diploma FAQ,btohqsg
Circles is planning to sell of their mvno network since M1 is merging now,btohqsg
I know all about networking because the course Im taking is about cybersecurity and networking ;),btohqsg
I personally think that simba will win big after M1 and StarHub merge because IMDA(Infocomm Media Development Authority)would ask StarHub to keep some bandwidth and give the rest back to them and they’ll reauction the bandwidth from M1 to new players or simba.My speculation is that simba will buy these bandwidths to keep up with SingTel & StarHub but there is another speculation going around that there’s going to be a new network joining into the race but that seems very unlikely.,btohqsg
"ahh  i acknowledge what you said but i don't think there's much to speculate for the time beingeven if there has been plans for a company to buy over an existing project  it doesn't always happen very quickly in singapore (not sure about other countries but i know acquiring company assets and corporations have a more regulated policies process in sg)so learning such information from whatever sources we may hear  read or see  doesn't necessarily mean it will follow through because we never know what goes behind closed doors-- which in this case are the companies involved and the relevant government departmentsi like to think there's a difference with the ""wants"" of desiring something and ""ability"" of ensuring the process runs smoothly to the end  when it comes to different industries or situations because different contexts require different approaches",btohqsg
plus if simba wants to make big  the parent company (Tuas Limited) had to decide on its future prospects,btohqsg
a lot of people i know who use simba & heya (not going to count singtel because everyone around me avoids that telco brand like plague) complains about the lack of connectivity the telco has in many parts of the island,btohqsg
I feel like Tuas limited isn’t giving any investments for simba,btohqsg
you're not wrong  that's why they need to discuss within themselves how they want to arrange Simba's future,btohqsg
The main problem is with Imda,btohqsg
either sell it off completely  attract new investors or just remove it off the market,btohqsg
there isn't a main problem in a lot of things because IMDA may be just one problem which affects more than the rest but you gotta consider everything to make things going,btohqsg
Imda didn’t allow simba to bid for n78 (the fastest band that Singapore allows for 5G) because they were using Huawei 4G / 5G equipment which I personally feel discriminatory,btohqsg
Imda had 300mhz of n78 set for 5G in Singapore initially going for SingTel  Anita (Starhub and M1 merged 5G network) and simba but when TPG (SIMBA) said that they were using Huawei to deploy 5G base stations they barred them from deploying the fastest 5G band,btohqsg
Now they’re stuck with just 10mhz of n1 which will definitely not be enough for singaporeans,btohqsg
"honestly sg wants to play a more ""wait-and-see"" stance when it comes to certain matters which require the government leaders to tread more carefully on thin iceand yes  i disagree with this approach as well but you can't directly say that it's discrimination for IMDA to silently block SIMBA's move in wanting to bid for n78",btohqsg
I think simba’s downfall started after Vodafone Hutch bought over their Australian counterparts,btohqsg
TPG has such a good start tbh,btohqsg
they just played their cards so badly,btohqsg
i know one political reference to this situation,btohqsg
SIMBA has really weird bandwidth assigned to them,btohqsg
LTE B40+B40 also known as (2300Mhz) doesn’t work together from what I’ve learnt,btohqsg
cannot be helped especially since the parent company (Tuas Limited) & government don't seem very keen on providing further support,btohqsg
maybe that's why they say  once bitten  twice shy,btohqsg
Upload speeds will be crappy while download speeds will be good,btohqsg
not very consistent in terms of the internet speed or connectivity outreach  lol,btohqsg
Simba had the chance to reappeal for other bands but they were shy and just let it be,btohqsg
I remember M1’s prime when celcom Axiata used to own them,btohqsg
"tbh  a lot of the telco brands in sg don't really have many ""prime eras"" because they either function based on affordability or* long-standing reputation",btohqsg
wait r we talking abt simba,btohqsg
because i am currently FED UP,btohqsg
specifically yes but generally we're talking about sg telco,btohqsg
with simba in this moment of time,btohqsg
That’s why I switched out :),btohqsg
i am super FED UP right now,btohqsg
i just upgraded to an apple phone,btohqsg
i didnt have issues back when i was using my oppo phone,btohqsg
if it sucks  no matter how affordable it is  don't continue buying,btohqsg
but the moment i input the sim into my new phone,btohqsg
cause simba honestly suits android phones more,btohqsg
Got fed up after I needed to post my assignment and my simba was being unresponsive,btohqsg
iPhones don’t work well with simba,btohqsg
Apple threw them out of the 5G supported page,btohqsg
They’re not officially recognised by Apple anymore,btohqsg
I’ve been living my dream with SingTel now,btohqsg
does anyone else with simba plans experienced not being able to receive incoming calls or even dial sometimes with the signal bars functioning?,btohqsg
I’d personally recommend giga now for iPhones,btohqsg
Or buy M1 sim only 5G plan before M1 merges with StarHub,btohqsg
