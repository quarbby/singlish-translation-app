wah then i sian he never get promoted away so phew for me,btohqsg
my pw cher classes dist rate no lower than 92% A,btohqsg
maybe thats why he got promoted,btohqsg
The matri and orient gave it away for me as it is very clear that ya jpjc,btohqsg
Bois and females for geog elective we can learn either tourism or weather right?? Or do we need to learn both,btohqsg
U mean in case of hybrid?,btohqsg
there will be  stated in syllabus,btohqsg
U guys r not studying tourism ah,btohqsg
how are a levels ppl doing,btohqsg
is it weird to be more stressed during o levels preparation as compared to a levels,btohqsg
bc of the amount of papers within a short period of time,btohqsg
If u are prepared  there's nothing to feae,btohqsg
I would say  about the same as o levels,btohqsg
no one is fully prepared for a levels i think,btohqsg
and im not even at that level,btohqsg
Keep calm and donâ€™t tilt under pressure,btohqsg
I thought u alr knew ur result,btohqsg
What was Ur prelim for eng,btohqsg
Can someone help me for combined chemistry,btohqsg
U can ask in the o level chat grp,btohqsg
I will be done by tmr.,btohqsg
This kind of qn I can help u haha,btohqsg
wtf is wrong with SEAB this year,btohqsg
seab this year say fuck u,btohqsg
u either get the easiest paper,btohqsg
Since when got tangent and all those thing one,btohqsg
rate of reaction nid calculate meh,btohqsg
Idts  need to sketch how the curve will look like only I thought,btohqsg
the curve is increasing at a decreasing rate,btohqsg
It was set two years ago tho,btohqsg
since tdys ppr this dog im betting chem gonna be the easiest thing,btohqsg
Are the speed of reaction tests that must be remembered tomorrow,btohqsg
and physics gonna be the hardest hting,btohqsg
Whenever u see a graph den u ask urself if u know how to drawnit,btohqsg
But what exactly affects the volume of products created?,btohqsg
Like temperature of the mixture  concentration of the mixture and exposed surface area increase the speed of reaction,btohqsg
Speed of reaction wise there is concentration  temperature  pressure for gaseous reactant...,btohqsg
But what increases the volume of product produced,btohqsg
If Ur reaction is one way,btohqsg
Unless ure talking about reversible reaction?,btohqsg
Then what affects the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
I think he/she talking about the volume of the product form,btohqsg
Altho I never see it come out before,btohqsg
And assuming the product is gaseous?,btohqsg
assuming product is gaseous pressure can affect it,btohqsg
The greater the volume of the product formed,btohqsg
Ure confusing everyone. U talking about pressure of the reaction mixture of the pressure or the product chamber,btohqsg
Can u clairfy what's Ur question,btohqsg
So the more moles there are,btohqsg
Affect the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
