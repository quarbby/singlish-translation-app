Toyota Honda won‚Äôt make cars that are enjoyable to drive. For a start they use cvt trans which is a no no for European cars. Mazda does not use cvt at all.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve had enough of bmw. They‚Äôre boring. Same looks models after models,btohqsg
It‚Äôs safe. A few times I go in abs they don‚Äôt bother to check,btohqsg
If caught fined $100 worth taking the risk to test,btohqsg
Can pass? Like abit lower than 3/4,btohqsg
just got messaged from my family member driving across  he saw ICA checking petrol levels so please be safe,btohqsg
there are very few cars crossing  its very easy for them to stop and check you to get their KPIs up now while traffic is light,btohqsg
wise choice of caption picture üòÇ,btohqsg
Do not go during midnight. That‚Äôs where checking takes place always,btohqsg
Just when i thou ppls won't shake their car when pump in sg. This fellow hold up the cars behind waiting for him to shake his toyota raize. The poor pump attendant lady still help to shake his car also.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£,btohqsg
Reason why we cant have good stuff or nice things,btohqsg
Just pump in sg. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i like our spc ambience,btohqsg
Its their decision to pump 95. They get caught  then so be it. Regardless what sinkies pump  bottomline  sinkies still spending a lot whenever we are there.,btohqsg
But you said its the reason we cant have good stuffs or nice things?,btohqsg
Does it matter? üåäüè© will reject your $$?,btohqsg
Saw another article that Najib complained about Singaporeans pumping 95 petrol  which is heavily subsidized for Malaysians.I find that it is a valid reason for not allowing Singaporeans to pump 95.Imagine if u are a corporate and giving out free food to low income employees‚Ä¶ yet senior employees try to get a share of it,btohqsg
Malaysia has one of the lowest fuel costs in the world,btohqsg
But its costing them alot by subsidizing 95 to their people really salute them,btohqsg
Did you know a perodua smallest 850 cc car roadtax only rm20 a year,btohqsg
And a 2 liter engine car is only rm328,btohqsg
U need to respect their laws just like you expect visitors to respect ours when they are in (SG). Basic manners lah nothing to be salty about,btohqsg
Yes‚Ä¶ just like we won‚Äôt want their citizens to come here and get gst vouchers which the govt allocates for low income Singaporeans,btohqsg
So basically this article is trying to say?,btohqsg
I feel its a different thing Going to msia pump petrol is a everyday thing while them working here getting a PR status or etc is different. In a way Hmmm,btohqsg
Don't expect fuel subsidy from Govt,btohqsg
Yah precisely they beat around the bush trying to explain their ground in de end is No Subsidy LOL,btohqsg
I can hear Minister Chan Chun Sing saying:Mai Sia Suay la,btohqsg
It's a no ending situation the moment they agree to have subsidy.. we would then be expecting more everytime something bad happens also..,btohqsg
True also lah. So lets take it if no Tax means per L of 95 is at $2.20,btohqsg
Go Malaysia pump 95 lor üòÇüòÇ...,btohqsg
tax subsidies have cost. The money has to come from somewhere. expecting fuel subsidies means to balance the budget  the shortfall needs to be made up somewhere else. so this could mean another 1% on gst  or higher income or property tax. Does this sound fair? IMO i dont think so. I am personally against any form of fuel subsidy in singapore because for us  the car owners are more likely have higher levels of wealth or income,btohqsg
super interesting. nearly 1 billion a year in tax revenue from fuel for the government. Imagine if gets cut by half...how much GST would need to go up to make up the shortfall,btohqsg

Doesn't impact the vehicle owners or those who can afford it but rather the private hire drivers/taxi drivers will feel the pinch..,btohqsg
some might need help but they can be assisted in other ways than a broad fuel subsidy,btohqsg
Actually PHV drivers having 30% off Fuel right?,btohqsg
"from the article above: ""Nevertheless  Mr Wong said he recognises there are several groups such as taxi and private hire car drivers and delivery riders  who are affected by the increases in petrol and diesel prices.At present  various taxi and private hire car operators have implemented temporary increases in fares to help cushion the higher fuel prices for drivers  and to have consumers share the burden.""",btohqsg
Now do lalamove is super not worth it,btohqsg
Unless you have a hybrid or electric vehicle,btohqsg
Got T&Cs... is never a straightforward discount..Only sinopec discount is straightforward for phv drivers,btohqsg
Hmmm.. So Sinopec still stands out than other Stations i see,btohqsg
