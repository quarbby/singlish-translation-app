Hi do u guys use GXS debit card in jb? Any additional charges? How does it compare against iChange and youtrip,btohqsg
From my understanding  don't think GXS debit is suitable for overseas use. Best for Singapore use only. Trust card can check rate unlike YouTrip. I have no idea on how other card or app work. I only know trust and YouTrip.,btohqsg
Amaze wallet top-up with CC will incur at least 1% fee and get no rewards  so can only top-up with PayNow to get their better rates.Still better to link card and get smacked with 2% spread but earn rewards to cover the spread and come out net positive.,btohqsg
Can check with CSO for eligibility.,btohqsg
Check the MCC of the clinic and check against card t&c,btohqsg
Common for Citibank cards  just block replace rinse and repeat,btohqsg
0.25% cashback  after fees will be net loss. Would be better to just spend 500  same 0.25% cashback  no fees and clock bonus interest.,btohqsg
You can ask yourself if you want to be an exit point for any potentially illegal activity ü§™,btohqsg
Decent card with MasterCard FX rates  no FX fees and lucky draw cashback for transactions above S$10.Cannot lock in FX rates and cannot withdraw cash from ATM.,btohqsg

Hello guys  how to show proof of income if I am working for someone who is self-employ (Hawker store) and doesn't provide monthly payslip?,btohqsg
DP. Mr Coconut (UOB$ merchant) posts same day for UOB cards even though I transacted at 7pm...lol for those who want find a last minute posting merchant!,btohqsg
You need to declare income from your job  so your income tax will be your proof of income.,btohqsg
Me too  I have about 4K online spend,btohqsg
I'm not the business owner.I'm am working for a business owner. That doesn't provide monthly payslip,btohqsg
Why you need to show proof of income?,btohqsg
Oops. Read wrong. The business owner (your employer) has to provide you with form IR8A to declare your income to IRAS.,btohqsg
Maybe he trying to apply for CC?,btohqsg

I was just relooking at the TNCs of Plunging Chicken (attached below) and I think it doesn't really make sense for 1.6(iii).It means ALL YOUR UOB ACCOUNTS must have had NO ACTIVITY from 1st June to 30th June if you want to take part in the 1st July promo.So if you already have a salary credit for your UOB One account  BY RIGHT  it will also be caught by 1.6(iii). For example  your salary is $10 000 on 10th June  and you immediately transfer out the money (to maintain $1k MAB for example). Isn't that $10 000 considered as withdrawn from existing UOB account?Kind of ridiculous. It should be impossible for anyone to have ZERO ACTIVITY on all their UOB accounts from 1st June 2024 till 1st July 2024.1.6 ‚ÄúIncremental Fresh Funds‚Äù means funds in the amount of S$20 000  S$50 000  S$100 000 or S$150 000:(i) in the form of non-UOB cheques or non-UOB cashier‚Äôs order;(ii) that are not transferred from any existing UOB current/savings account; and(iii) that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account 30 days before or during the Promotion Period and re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into the Account indicated in the Registration (as defined below).,btohqsg
TLDR: I feel they would most likely NOT / UNABLE to enforce those who withdrew funds on 1st June morning (those we were worried about) since they would likely belong in the same category as those who have inward salary credit for example on 10th June.Disclaimer: This is just my own interpretation which may or may not be correct. For myself  I would only be using one of my humans (who had $1k MAB all along  BUT will have salary credit within June 2024) to take part in the new round of Plunging Chicken). I will NOT be using the human who withdrew $150 000 on 1st June as I don't want to lock up 2 humans for 4.5 months.Mitigation: In the event I am wrong  and the human I took part in July's Plunging Chicken does not get earmarked properly in August (registration month July)  I will just abandon the promo and take it as I earned 4% p.a. only,btohqsg
Uob one account itself also has a monthly average balance tracker (can only see after month ends) which is very useful for the earmark promo. Make sure you maintain the earmark amount + this mab amount + $10 buffer at all times throughout the promo.,btohqsg

Hey guys  ocbc 90n visa or mastercard better?,btohqsg
Oh shit... If I've transferred an amount into uob one in June to transfer out within the same day  does that means I've to top up in excess of that withdrawn amount in June? Doesn't really make sense...,btohqsg
Amaze DPI managed to link UOB Krisflyer credit card to Amaze. (did at 10am today),btohqsg
Hi guys  I have spare cash 50k sitting in my bank for nothing. Where should I park it to earn some interest? Any good FD  endowment plan or MMF in June 2024?Is Moomoo Cash Plus a good option? Can I still participate the 6.8% p.a. campaign given that the event period is approaching to the end soon on 1 July? Btw  why I couldn‚Äôt find this campaign under promotion page in the app?,btohqsg
Wanted to cardup insurance premium since t&c exclude insurance premium directly. I think i will just go with 90n. Thanks!,btohqsg
I have used honeygain and I have cash out once at least. But the earn rate was 3 credit for 10MB shared.My referral is 25% commission,btohqsg
Just to be clear (and to prevent potential issues)  honey gain is nothing affiliated to HoneyMoneySG,btohqsg
Hi can I check when a bank has confirmed my eligibility to get reward after I hit the min spend on a new cc. What if suddenly there‚Äôs refund on the card? For example hotel booking been cancelled,btohqsg
will likely clawback if you don't make up the spending within the period,btohqsg
What if The spending period has alr ended?,btohqsg
The old t&c states the same  just didn't include 30 days before promotion period.Technically just think of fresh funds as registered funds (150k) + salary crediting amount (which is 1.6k  for those who self-transfer).,btohqsg
Get 3.33% with Maybank Platinum Visa + CardUp also better.,btohqsg
