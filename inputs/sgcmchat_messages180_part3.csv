Swear i saw it near khatib mrt,btohqsg
tbf the telephoto lens on the iphone 15 isnt very good. Esp once you crop in a lot which i had to do to get the shot,btohqsg
The tele isnt even a tele,btohqsg
I use a 400mm on my r6ii,btohqsg
It is slightly too large for cars,btohqsg
Usually ill use a 70-200 2.8,btohqsg
i have an R5. when i have it with me  i shoot cars 35-50mm max,btohqsg
I find that card look weird when too wide,btohqsg
having said that i almost never bring my r5 out any more,btohqsg
I like sticking to the 135ish,btohqsg
Hows the r5? I heard its pretty damn similar to the r6ii,btohqsg
you can just step back and crop back in  it will mostly fix the compression issue and make it look like a telephoto. assuming you have enough megapixels,btohqsg
tbh i never used the r6 so i am not sure. but i think it would be pretty close,btohqsg
Cropping on the r6ii is slightly eh,btohqsg
the extra mp on the r5 is like a cheat code,btohqsg
for smaller mp sensors  you will need the tele,btohqsg
Of course im a wildlife photographer so i naturally prefer a longer lens 😂,btohqsg
Now that i think about it i only have one lens that isnt a tele…,btohqsg
im looking at the specs now  the r6 just looks like a faster shooting but smaller MP r5. i think those are the two major differences,btohqsg
The iso performance is pretty similar on both,btohqsg
Its like the 5d and 1d,btohqsg
Somehow i always gravitate towards high burst rate cameras 😆,btohqsg
But i gotta invest in longer lenses,btohqsg
do u even have a license?,btohqsg
not wrong but just keep ur opinions to urself,btohqsg
u know very well where it is,btohqsg
pls dont come to my house 🙏,btohqsg
top up my steam pls thanks,btohqsg
dont ask me help u pay,btohqsg
i buy with money laundering money,btohqsg
not gonna say much just gonna put this out there,btohqsg
not every rider who has a R15 is a bad rider  and there’s quite a lot of reasons to actually own an R15,btohqsg
tbf the R15 is one of the best bikes for Class 2B and a lot of experienced riders usually buy it as a second bike,btohqsg
honestly speaking for a first bike,btohqsg
had good memories using my r15,btohqsg
R15 will prob be my first bike when i license,btohqsg
> easy parts> good value> sizes for everyone> cheap to maintain> decent insurance,btohqsg
it’s really a bike that is super good,btohqsg
if you have reason then sure,btohqsg
if not i will just call you poser,btohqsg
It’s a good bike. Good start if u wanna venture into sports bike. Yamaha generally plug and play ah,btohqsg
the only bikes i don’t reccommend for a beginner is a W175 and Phantom,btohqsg
nothing will go wrong for school bikes w the exception of the newer bigger honda’s which i heard can get more hot than usual,btohqsg
you buy R15 when don’t have money also don’t make sense,btohqsg
who say YBR is shit bike?,btohqsg
every bike in the 2B cat is considered good because they all fit a certain need,btohqsg
and that’s literally exclusive to the category of 2B,btohqsg
only when you enter 2A and 2 then shit bikes will come out,btohqsg
your RVF  CBR1000 2005  and so on,btohqsg
my phantom is valued at $92 and still runs like a dream,btohqsg
