Don't be mean... He or she has tried his or her best,btohqsg
Plus straight Us to straight As do happen,btohqsg
A pass in prelim to an A is not impossible,btohqsg
Just don't care about what others thinkx and look forward ok?,btohqsg
I got like U grade for math,btohqsg
But it didn't affect me at all haha,btohqsg
I just told myself to work harder and do better the next time,btohqsg
Maybe for me is cos idrk about grades,btohqsg
Esp if u try ur best,btohqsg
U feel like u wasted ur effort etc,btohqsg
That could be due to many factors. You might not have to do much to get an A in A levels,btohqsg
And some of ur friends didn't even try,btohqsg
But also  what the Russian guy said isn't completely wrong also. Prelim they make it much tougher than A level usually,btohqsg
So it's normal to be stuck doing prelim paper,btohqsg
Because some people fall sick for prelims  some people don't feel well  some people can't understand school paper questions but can understand A level questions (like me),btohqsg
It's very dependant on the individual's circumstances,btohqsg
The grade don't really determine whether u good/bad student also,btohqsg
To be honest  prelims is so unreflective of your potential grades for A levels  it's a farce,btohqsg
But some people get A for prelim and then get poorer grades for A levels,btohqsg
Sometimes it is incorrect revision methods for A levels (such as  doing prelim paper only),btohqsg
They usually say prelim is an indicator  if u scoring B/A  most likely a level also B/A  but then the issue is prelim is also pretty rushed also  the exams are very packed and u don't have much time to do full revision. But after prelims   the no school period u can revise etc and I'm sure that will make a difference.,btohqsg
True true.One thing that is interesting is that some schools don't give students A for prelims in certain subjects,btohqsg
Some school‚Äôs prelim exams are v high,btohqsg
For chem  HCI  VJC  NJC and NYJC are v tough,btohqsg
Lol I'm not being mean  just being brutally honest,btohqsg
Barely passing prelims is not acceptable and you should know that,btohqsg
Promos still understandable but prelims no,btohqsg
"I'm not gonna pretend and say ""Oh it's alright everything will be fine"" when you have 1.5 months left",btohqsg
In any case  good luck to you.,btohqsg
Yeah but its often taught in secondary school as ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù,btohqsg
Logic is a branch of philosophy,btohqsg

I feel u. Dun worry. Just work doubly hard from now on.,btohqsg
and use the anger to spur u on,btohqsg
