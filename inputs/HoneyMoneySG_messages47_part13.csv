Hi all members  what is the best credit cards to use for 0% instalments but still get to enjoy all the benefits that come with the card. For example  Maybank Visa Platinum considers these kind of payments not eligible to earn the 3.33%.,btohqsg

What‚Äôs the best credit card if you a big spender,btohqsg
I rmb seeing it state $300 cash back on first $3000 for 2mth,btohqsg
Depend on what u spend on (catergory and mcc),btohqsg
Which I not sure if it‚Äôs misleading trying to say for the $300 u get is from spending $3000 or is it like a promotion cash back rate for first 2 mth at 10% cashback which is $300 from first $3000 spending,btohqsg
What card would you recommend for using CardUp? Citi Rewards or HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation. I am not concerned about the instalment as these are the options provided by the merchant itself. I am more interested to know about the benefits from these plans.,btohqsg
As in to whether I will still enjoy the benefits from these cards if I take up the installment plans from the merchants.,btohqsg
