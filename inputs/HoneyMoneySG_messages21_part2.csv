oh so amex till got its perks,btohqsg
but if use other cards for the purchase  will be random rewards given ranging from $0.10 to $10 right ?Because for DBS card its confirm fixed $10 additional up till 5 times,btohqsg
wonder if we buy topup card like itunes card will uob one earn ppints ?,btohqsg
in terms of 'limitless cashback' (thats what UOB terms it)  UOB Absolute earns u 1.7% on most things that are excluded.But now  they nerfed Grab top-ups so this means AMEX TCB 1.5% has the most liberal cashback since it had not yet nerfed Grab Top-ups,btohqsg
i dont think so.UOB ONE i tested only counts NTUC Physical Vouchers purchase as eligible spend. ie. u go NTUC buy from the aunty that type. I use this method when i need to hit quota,btohqsg
hmm so u suggest i buy ntuc voucher from ntuc use uob one to earn points then use ntuc voucher buy itunes card?,btohqsg
if u not sure  the best way to test is to buy small amount  then wait for the purchase to be posted on your card  call the bank n ask them is the MCC code for that purchase count towards eligible spend.,btohqsg
or i use amex buy captialmall voucher and and use capitalmall voucher to buy itunes card haha,btohqsg
huh? NTUC voucher is to buy groceries at NTUC bro,btohqsg
ntuc got sell top up cards i recall,btohqsg
wait i share with u 2 method,btohqsg
safer is i use amex hoot capitalmall voucher and hoot using captialmall voucher buy topup card like itunes,btohqsg
seem like most cc dont earn points if u use to pay for subscription to itunes or googlle play,btohqsg
1) If u buy NTUC physical voucher using UOB ONE  that earns u base 3.33% rebate on the card. Then u indirectly use that voucher to buy your iTunes card. But it's best to buy a cheap iTunes card then pay for it using UOB ONE then call up UOB to see if that is eligible spend or not. If it is then u can buy directly mah  if not then u need to buy NTUC voucher then use voucher buy iTunes.2) next is to use UOB Absolute to buy capitaMall eVoucher. U get 1.7% rebate for the purchase then u can use capitalmal eVoucher to buy anything for participating merchants.but test with option 1 since that earns u higher rebates.,btohqsg
no harm try try get a cheap itune,btohqsg
the option 2 is more or less proven,btohqsg
really meh? i tot subscription is counted as eligible spend?e.g. netflix  spotify  etcshouldn't things purchased on iTunes and Google Play be counted as eligible spend since these are retail purchases?,btohqsg
Just received this:UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
Time to move back to AMEX TCB Card for grab top up,btohqsg
Is this consider online Spend for DBS Live Fresh Card?,btohqsg
scb smart didnt state purchase or use to top up for itunes to be able to earn point but its only say netflix example,btohqsg
i only use option 1 when there's promotion.e.g. usually xmas promotion CapitalMall have top-up promo. Last year was every $100 top up gets 10% bonus eVoucher with any credit card. So if u use UOB Absolute 1.7%  effectively  topping up $100 gets u $17 bonus.,btohqsg

challenger should accept caplitalmall  E voucher i recall,btohqsg
voucher purchases do not count as eligible spending on most credit cards. U need to call the bank to check. Or test out by purchasing a small amount then call bank to check the MCC code.UOB Absolute 1.7% is special as it is marketed as 'limitless cashback' and can earn cashback on categories normally excluded by other cards such as insurance  hospital bills  etc,btohqsg
Oh so many people posted already,btohqsg
the community now on FIRE leAll trying to find alternative methodsSome just signed up UOB Absolute then now nerfed,btohqsg
Hmm whatâ€™s the best alternative method ? Amex true cash back card ?,btohqsg
ya next best before it get nerf,btohqsg
direct replacement is AMEX TCB 1.5%but be prepared AMEX might nerf Grab Top Upsbe prepared AXS might remove Grab paymentsAlso  sign up promo for AMEX 3% EXCLUDES GRAB top-ups.'be prepared' means not yet nerfed but who knows when,btohqsg
Imagine both axs and amex nerf grab  then grab would close door already.,btohqsg
Gg time to drop grab out of the equation,btohqsg
If one of the amex Singapore management see your post will probably take your suggestion ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
correct.now i don't even know how to maintain Platinum status on grabneed 4500 points every 6 mths to extend further 6 mths,btohqsg
Also  Amex True Cashback is still ok for 1.5% Cashback on Grabpay Wallet (FOR NOW)Sign up at AMEX True Cashbackhttps://hmsg.link/amextcb,btohqsg
yes TCB can top up Grab to earn 1.5%,btohqsg
but the promo excludes grab Top ups,btohqsg
Are there any cards that works without grab for bill payments? Cashback or miles are fine,btohqsg
What is the best promo for Amex TCB card signup pls,btohqsg
what type of bills?UOB One credit card counts handphone bills  internet  Singapore power and electricity provider  spotify  netflix  etc as eligible,btohqsg
Oh yea essentially those  primarily utilities (and annual insurance and tax but I think can use citi payall for those),btohqsg
insurance and tax are excluded - not eligible,btohqsg
@oaksticoh citi can pay for recurring insurance ?,btohqsg
Sucks that amex isnâ€™t as widely accepted in SG,btohqsg
I remember reading that insurance was eligible yea,btohqsg
amex not targeted for peasants i think,btohqsg
Actually i feel its quite widely accepted already. Esp compared to like indonesia  malaysia.,btohqsg
So far  I see most of you are in Group 2  which is a good sign.,btohqsg
need to use citi pay? or just setup any citi card for it?,btohqsg
But thanks for the suggestion  looks like I should cancel uob absolute and move to uob one,btohqsg
