This is considered a low-risk investment (Not capital guaranteed)https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/wisesaver/Are my capital and returns guaranteed?There is no guarantee of the capital amount. However  as the underlying instrument is a cash fund which places your money predominantly in fixed deposits of local financial institutions with a minimum short-term rating of F2 by Fitch  P-2 by Moody's  or A-2 by S&P  it is very unlikely that you will experience any capital loss.Your returns depend on the weighted average gross yield of the underlying deposits  which may fluctuate as market and economic conditions change.Your savings earn interest on a daily basis net of fees based on the current weighted average gross yield published.,btohqsg
