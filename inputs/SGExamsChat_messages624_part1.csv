Thatâ€™s y Iâ€™m only considering sp and np,btohqsg
Dawg I did that and it was futile,btohqsg
Because nyp is like 1.5h away while rp is 1.25 h away,btohqsg
HAHAHA i studied ( well did my hw ) for the 1st time in like the week jn b4 gg out HELPðŸ˜­,btohqsg
after cny no more reason le,btohqsg
some people in your batch are just,btohqsg
What course did u go to,btohqsg
expose u to both engineering and business,btohqsg
Erm fun and % to uni,btohqsg
it's got to do with space and.. rockets  right,btohqsg
now they wan to include space stuff,btohqsg
Actually I think I donâ€™t wanna go mi anymore,btohqsg
Doesn't  aeronautical include space stuff in the first space,btohqsg
Because I rmb I work dam hard in o lvl for science and I still got 6,btohqsg
Because ppl said mi notes sucks,btohqsg
lel pls my snrs say some of our notes btr than low tier jcs,btohqsg
bascially u learn mechanical  electrical and business stuff,btohqsg
My friends going jc said they choose by their notes,btohqsg
No my l1r5 is 22 ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
It doesn't even appear in form A,btohqsg
"Pls let me believe that ""lie""",btohqsg
but somehow for sp they didnt include intil recently,btohqsg
Or can I appeal some course related to biomed because I am currently doing sorta internship at nccs,btohqsg
Right if notes trash u self study and do btr,btohqsg
1 pt was enough to get my rejected,btohqsg
It's almost the same as sayin you're relying on your Cher to spoon feed you,btohqsg
no way in hell u gonna get in with 4 pt difference no offence,btohqsg
donâ€™t even bother putting in ur Jae,btohqsg
Oh ya r u going uni or just work,btohqsg
if u rlly want then u can try dae,btohqsg
Yea my l1r5 is like -,btohqsg
Should I consider nyp or rp because I can go into business courses there,btohqsg
what do you even want to do,btohqsg
ur going from engin to biomed to biz,btohqsg
u should really consider why u wanna go the courses,btohqsg
if not we will be curious about your choices,btohqsg
I said engin because I could get in with my score to go biomed engin,btohqsg
coz end day is like we are not the one studying for u,btohqsg
so really jus have a look at what the course have to offer and see if the modules u like anot,btohqsg
i can give u some advice for SP modules,btohqsg
hard in sci and engineering then,btohqsg
My math is good so I think I would prefer business,btohqsg
I mean if u rlly want u can work ur way up but very risky,btohqsg
Wouldnâ€™t like accounting or banking deal with math?,btohqsg
click more to see what the module is about,btohqsg
then we can advice u more based on the modules u take,btohqsg
the math you deal with in smth like accountancy is generally pretty basic btw,btohqsg
o lvl maths is nothing compared to poly jc uni level btw,btohqsg
esp if you pursue any STEM path in uni,btohqsg
H2 maths usually is enough for most STEM,btohqsg
