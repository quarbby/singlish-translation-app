Everyone looking for money now that interest rates mooning.,btohqsg
any credit cards to use for insurance payments?,btohqsg
Anyone have difficulty login in to GXS?,btohqsg
So this one no hoops? Like salary deposit? haha,btohqsg
GxS need to create a savings pocket then move to that pocket for higher interest. But the major hoop is getting invited in the first place,btohqsg
I was able to create the account but couldn't login,btohqsg
Some issue with application signup process.,btohqsg
For my case  I waited awhile  able to login there after.,btohqsg
So I guess GxS open registration now?,btohqsg
yay moving more money into gxs now!,btohqsg
Ocbc TR bonus point 9x is in for Jun spent,btohqsg
Anyone know why webull disable the take profit/stop loss function?,btohqsg
So just keep $75k max in savings pocket is the most efficient right. It mentions compound interest but I doubt thereâ€™s any compounding on top of 75k?,btohqsg
Ask you to do investing only  not trading. You can use CFD for trading. The SL and TP work very well.,btohqsg
Not only Webull  I found moomoo and IBKRâ€™s SL and TP are not nice  either.,btohqsg
"for those who are planning to get Cashback for school/exam fees by using certain credit cards  please take note that there is a chance that merchant code used could be ""government services"" which will result in zero Cashback.",btohqsg
Revolut card for Singapore users is Visa or Mastercard ? google   every country is different .,btohqsg
Hi  so can we just put all $75k in the various pockets to earn the interest of 3.48%? Must we keep some funds in the main account also?,btohqsg
Main account only earn 0.08%. So put all in pocket,btohqsg
I had mine long time ago  expiring in 2027  is a Mastercard.,btohqsg
My GXS application via Singpass just got rejected twice even tho all my info is up to date. Anyone else having similar issue?,btohqsg
Maybe they already hit their limit? On their site they did state they closed new registrations until the next window  until whenever they want to open it up again.EDIT: Don't use VPN,btohqsg
Try to switch off and apply again,btohqsg
Wah. So good. When I apply just now. It says under review.,btohqsg
never knew VPN / IP address was a factor,btohqsg
It would be funny if they only allow people using Singtel ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Maybe using Grab and Singtel give priority.,btohqsg
Grab is a must have to qualify iirc,btohqsg
oh wut  its not open to all yet?,btohqsg
hello  any non-pr/non-SG citizen recently applied for UOB CCs? have you gotten your approval from UOB? Applied two weeks ago and no new until now ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Iâ€™m existing UOB CC  Singapore citizen my waiting time was 2-3weeks. They are extremely slow ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Same  the app just hang there,btohqsg
damn then I guess it'll be a month for me ahhahaha,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sp holder  and I applied 3 weeks ago still no response,btohqsg
I think due to lately high volume for TS concert. The waiting time might even double,btohqsg
Yst I tried calling UOB CS  literally they donâ€™t let me wait on the call. They just hang and expect me to write in or call other timing,btohqsg
damn I guess only can wait,btohqsg
Yeap same case as well called yesterday,btohqsg
Moneysmart email say point system rather than cashback. Not sure is it for the better or worse.,btohqsg
THANK you!!! I'm outside singapore  and I VPN back to SG  and it worked! ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
That's another way to do it ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
It will be unless u vpn back SG,btohqsg
I max out GXS liao! for those that deposit into GXS do remember to put into the savings pocket else you won't get the 3.48 P.A interest.,btohqsg
So when daily interests get added on and exceed 75k  we donâ€™t have to transfer out right. It will get compounded to the original 75k principle and continue to earn 3.48% right,btohqsg
I applied at 11pm and got SMS approval the very next morning at 8.40am. By noon can see my new card on internet banking already. UOB can be very fast,btohqsg
no need transfer out but those amount above 75k don't earn interest I think. but I not sure also.,btohqsg
Gxs move become game changer for savings strategy,btohqsg
Actually isnâ€™t the interest rate already similar to UOB one/ OCBC 360? Pardon the silly question,btohqsg
I think ocbc360 is only 3.25% for salary credit + $500 saving,btohqsg
But Uob one Is 3.85% for salary credit + saving + spending I think,btohqsg
