Hi  BHS is the Basic Healthcare sum  means cannot exceeed that amount in a given year. and only fixed when we turn age 65  based on cohort level sum.Excess funds from MA will overflow to SA  and if SA hit FRS  it will overflow to OA. (Granted)No Volunteer topping up to MA once BHS reached  any excess amount will be refunded.Assume MA already maxed at current BHS $71 500.Question: During the Mandatory toppping up by employer on a monthly basis. the manadatory contribution still goes to MA When does the overflow take place? 1st January 2025? or on a month on month basis? is there FAQ on this or stated anywhere?,btohqsg
Your second line answered your main question. Overflow immediately.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone have any opinion on infinity US 500 Stock if I plan to invest in it long term using OA?,btohqsg
I believe no longer can liao,btohqsg
Not bad idea! If u need endowus sign up let me know. Amundi Prime usa is also not bad with slightly lower fees.,btohqsg
Hi  in how many days it is approved.,btohqsg
Oh thanks  I‚Äôve already signed up actually üòÖ,btohqsg
1 difference to note about the 2.  I bought both  but I realized my Infinity US500 grew slightly more over the same time period as compared to Amundi Prime USA.,btohqsg
Hi experts  for successful moomoo 6.8% of 50k fresh deposit  if subscription of max 80k (eg. existing plus new fund) has reached in cash plus account  will withdrawing the money (unuse fund not in the cash plus account) back to bank affect the redemption and eligibility?,btohqsg
I see! I assume it‚Äôs better to purchase two of the different funds rather than consolidate all my money in one fund right,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt read it research much on amundi  but I‚Äôll check it out,btohqsg
based on endowus website they share the same exact annualised gains of 30.89. But since Amundi is a relative young stock  we don't have much data points to compare it with lion global infinity. Very hard to say about the future also haha,btohqsg
Thank you so much for sharing Shawn & Michael! Will do some research after!,btohqsg
Endowus is not cheap  plan to terminate it,btohqsg
what other options would u suggest for CPF OA investing?,btohqsg
You‚Äôre referring to the transaction costs right?,btohqsg
Sorry  you‚Äôre referring to this fund fee right  which is 0.33% which will be charged on a quarterly basis based on the gains made right?,btohqsg
Endowus charges platform fees which are on top of the individual fund charges,btohqsg
Fund fees: paid to fund manager (e.g. vanguard) to maintain the fundPlatform fees: paid to Endowus to recommend  rebalance  hold funds  etc.,btohqsg
Myself being an Endowus user since 2020  I think I shall explain how the fees  cashback  transaction cost works based on my cash/srs/cpf portfolios.1) Fund FeesFund fees are already accounted for in the NAV price of the unit trust  so you don't really see the effect of it unless you compare 2 unit trusts that has similar holdings i.e. one has higher fund fees than the other - net earnings reduced marginally.2) CashbackThe good thing about Endowus is that cashback (trailer fee) is returned to us as retail investors. Other platforms like FSMOne  iFast  even the banks keep these trailer fees  and they earn them! Some banks charge 'sales charge'. In the end your earnings are reduced. How the cashback is calculated by Endowus - They take the average invested amount of the portfolio for each quarter  and they return it back to you  i.e. back to your cash account in Endowus (for cash) or to your cpf oa/srs associated with your chosen bank agent (for cpf/srs).3) Transaction CostCash/srs no issue. You do lump sum or DCA  no transactional costs. For cpf  unfortunately the charge lies with the bank (DBS/UOB/OCBC) and not Endowus. Hence for those who wish to invest your cpf oa  it is best that your lump sum or DCA is a bigger amount to make sure that your $2+ fees deducting your cpf oa is worth it.4) Platform FeesEndowus did state the percentage amount for their various portfolios. If fund smart (single fund)  fee is reduced to 0.3%. Not to forget there is a 9% gst fee on top of that. What endowus does is either deduct from your cash account (for cash) if there is some money there  or if not  redeem from your portfolio (for cash/cpf/srs) by selling some units from your unit trust.Hope my explanation helps.,btohqsg
I see! Thanks for the explanation Shawn! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Can I ask if dbs amaze exclusion includes DBS Vantage for 1.5mpd local spend? Thanks for help in advance,btohqsg
1. Vantage is Visa  Amaze works with Mastercard only2. All DBS cards exclude Amaze transactions3. What‚Äôs the point on using it for local spend  since for Vantage there‚Äôs no difference between online & offline,btohqsg
