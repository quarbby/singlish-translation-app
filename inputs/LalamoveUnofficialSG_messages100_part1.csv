I am a relief(weekend) taxi driver. Comfortdelgo taxi.The company has own petrol kiosk.Whenever I take lalamove job  I will on meter to calculate if the trip is better with pax or not worth the trip. So far so good.,btohqsg
I pump 40 litres after LLM discount about 8x,btohqsg
I stack up 2 order. Total meter cost $22.15 plus delivery up n down. But total collected from lalamove $43 dollar,btohqsg
So this order is good üëç,btohqsg
Total distance 23.4km  petrol cost is $2.25,btohqsg

Lalamove unable to take stack orders ah?,btohqsg
I kena on cry eve. Pickup from restaurant in NP. Was closed.  But somehow the order went through in oodles. CS said nothing they can do cos I never called to confirm.  I told them I did but restaurant never answer my call  Paid parking for nothing and wasted my time.,btohqsg
This is the trick that lalamove use have to call customer and if you don't Lala will put the blame on you,btohqsg
Sorry to say that  in LLM driver are always in fault,btohqsg
Lalamove driver are always at fault,btohqsg
Saw today a delivery job for motorbikes    pickup from fusionpolis and deliver to 10 drops with the final one at tampines for a grand total of 69.60 I think.After commission   the poor delivery fella is left with 57 bucks.What a rip-off!Finally after 3 plus hours of no one taking the job   I think a desperate bro finally accepted.,btohqsg
True that... If there is a better platform who puts agents above customer will you join. ?,btohqsg
hi old birds  just curious how do you guys stack deliveries?,btohqsg
Hihi any idea to maximise time and efficiency if want to do 2 trips minimum a day?,btohqsg
Wait for the first one that most convenient and worth it then after complete wait for the second 1?,btohqsg
Try this way for example if get the first job by 10 am finish about 11 am depend on the distance and second job try luck again?,btohqsg
Do only peak hour (many orders). Pick up from shopping malls (easy to stack). Short distance trips with driving time 5-10min (max efficiency),btohqsg
I only want do single trip,btohqsg
If multiple stops can't fulfill or cock up in between penalty how,btohqsg
The parking to malls each time also from our own cash card yah,btohqsg
