cause we knew you were shitposting,btohqsg
it was that obv ah üíÄ,btohqsg
I sure hope I don't see someone put ex sgexams mod in linkedin LOL,btohqsg
my second cca is more low commitment so i joined,btohqsg
ugh i still got one more hist lect,btohqsg
i went through bridging and i can safely say  i did not learn anything from it xD,btohqsg
all my knowledge was learnt through h2 math class,btohqsg
i even still have my mi bridging notes from like 2017 (?) or some shit...,btohqsg
No no i will get expelled bruh  verbal slap,btohqsg
I think i just cant overcome the fear sia but i still try prepare for standard qns but dk how to stand out (i just know this time gonna be 100x more competitive than my internship)  then i scared i cant elab my points enough. Actually how to find out whats wrong and improve on interview skills,btohqsg
how to stand out kinda depends on the employer/organisation bc it depends on what they want but the best you can do is research on them sufficiently to try and tailor your responses to them. the more you know what they are  what they offer  and what you‚Äôre looking to get out of it  the easier it gets to answer genuinely without getting stuck,btohqsg
It is pretty useless and i think only that few sessions only?? (At least for TM la),btohqsg
to find out what‚Äôs wrong you gotta practice enough with people that can give feedback (or just fail enough),btohqsg
Is it true that not asking them qns is a red flag fr employer‚Äôs perspective,btohqsg
Coz when i did my internship intv  i actually asked qns for the sake of asking coz of this,btohqsg
what kind of stuff did you ask,btohqsg
I dun actually know what to ask,btohqsg
So i actually asked some bs,btohqsg
Ok for MI's case  since its 3 years theyll be going slow and explaining everything away so theres really no point in me double listening to the same thing in the morning and in the evening...in fact it just tires me more LOL,btohqsg
Coz i dw go into 2nd round of interviews,btohqsg
for questions try to think in terms of you personally what you want the job to be like,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why people ask about work environment (fast paced? independent? very team oriented?)  schedule  specific job scope and responsibilities  what a working day might look like  career progression  expectations if the supervisor or wtv is there,btohqsg
that‚Äôs just on the top of my head,btohqsg
can ask about the difficult parts or concerns you may have  what stuff you‚Äôd have to pick up,btohqsg
i mean it depends on the role la but yea,btohqsg
Ah ic  coz for context this one is kinda training type? So idk if i ask sth that red flag,btohqsg
Okie but firstly was your emath knowledge cmi..ü§°,btohqsg
okay la I did have double math background but i genuinely thought ppl whose emath is q tuff shouldn't struggle in H2 math esp w the bridging shit uk,btohqsg
True‚Ä¶so bridging is basically similar thing??,btohqsg
they rlly did kinda teach abit of amath stuff here and there in y1,btohqsg
i guess the idea is that even if you wanna portray that you‚Äôre confident in handling things  you still wanna clarify more of how it‚Äôs like before taking it on,btohqsg
like if you were offered multiple similar jobs  what would be the determining factors that tell you whether smth is good or better,btohqsg
Do they not? Eg differentiation  theyll teach how to do in it class  then imagine you have to go to an evening bridging class where they teach you how to do the same thing  like wtf im bored and tired,btohqsg
Im really bad at interviews but i will see how it goesüôèüôèI just dk if my qns will be appropriateüò¢,btohqsg
jiayous. no harm asking for opinions on your questions or doing research on what people typically ask,btohqsg
i‚Äôve done a ton of interviews and i still get nervous so it‚Äôs normal,btohqsg
Oh wtf there was bridging class?,btohqsg
Y-yes for those less unfortunate that do not take A math like aku,btohqsg
Oh man I didn't know y'all go went thru that   I know for last year  those who didn't take amath yet take H2 math were to report somewhere go a debriefing,btohqsg
idk if it was in regard to that,btohqsg
this isn‚Äôt PW where you just memo answers or smth. the clearer you are about what your objective is  the easier it is to just answer. the prep is important too,btohqsg
They should honestly just scrap that whole shit anyway. All the basics are gone through slowly in class anyway  so slow thst some of my classmates who took A math just took that time to sleep,btohqsg
Oh yikes the pace for me not liddat anymore leh like at y2 at least,btohqsg
I rmb for last two years the batches would also learn calculus in y1 iirc,btohqsg
But for my batch we only start learning in y2,btohqsg
Okay maybe my experience is vastly different compared to yall now,btohqsg
This means you are knowledgeable haha. I appreciate it when people know who she is üí´,btohqsg
Yes!!!! The recent Liu Cixin + Stef Sun + ÁéãËÄÖ collab is üß°,btohqsg
Actually idk HAHAHAHA coz ah pek only got play Pok√©mon hahahahaha I know the game coz I listen to Stef‚Äôs songs and got read Liu Cixin‚Äôs sci-fi books,btohqsg
U asked wrong ah pek already,btohqsg
