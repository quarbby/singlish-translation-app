this looks like a legit hearse,btohqsg
but the newer volvo wagons are fucking sexy,btohqsg
if i don't want vtec  i don't mind one of these,btohqsg

not to mention the amount of straight up racism towards anyone non-singaporean chinese,btohqsg
They will kaopei waste of COE  then cry mother father about how they cannot afford COE while these idiots can,btohqsg
i'm hazarding a guess that 99.9% of them have an empty head,btohqsg
They only believe they are right and not open to hear other people's opinion,btohqsg
It's so fucking bad that group,btohqsg
to them  any car expect a Cat A toyota deserves to be frowned upon lol,btohqsg
You try to have a civilised debate with anyone of them,btohqsg

HYyundai Avante 1.6A GLS,btohqsg
I would choose the hyundai. Very comfortable and family oriented car,btohqsg
The avante 1.6 GLS Jin comfortable,btohqsg
Attrage cmi. Sibei small  uncomfortable and the cc too small for long distance drive.,btohqsg
Honda city still ok. But avante better choice,btohqsg
Vezel just end journey from sg to Cameron highland,btohqsg
