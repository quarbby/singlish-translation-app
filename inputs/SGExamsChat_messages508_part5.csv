Dun wan random ppl come disturb,btohqsg
sign up for JP Morgan ‚Äòs apprenticeship,btohqsg

i put myself as childhood asthma,btohqsg
to be honest I don't really know myself. perhaps EVs,btohqsg
ah i see. tbh the topics r q dry. so not for everyone,btohqsg
but risky ah. if your performance like shit they can choose not to sign you. then u sign on and full time 10 years already. When 30 years old and have degree  considered as 0 working experience and really have to drop pay alot,btohqsg
yeah I went front and back the JAE booklet and still can't make much of a decision. I know I'll suffer in engineering courses simply because my knowledge in mathematics isn't very deep.,btohqsg
ev is gd but now they are pushing for hydrogen cars since ev have more disadv than adv,btohqsg
yea makes sense. join smth u love/have Interest one,btohqsg
if have a degree in business management  considered 0 working experience. depends on your vocation also if you are an engineer/maintenance officer.when I'm talking about working experience  im referring to in the relevant specialisations of your studies,btohqsg
if only got sleeping courses üôè,btohqsg
Why do y'all ppl all care so much abt pay when experience is clearly btr,btohqsg
she gt influenced by who alr,btohqsg
SG overcompetitive and expensive. can't really deny the fact that we need money to survive. If you say 2-3k/month is okay then good for you la.But if let's say want to buy house  get married and have kids  2-3k is NOT enough to live as a middle income family which most people do not want to acceptIf you are okay with living below 80%  that's good for you.End of the day  everybody is trying to live happy and unfortunately for many of us  money is just such a huge factor to happiness,btohqsg
Jesus was hated because he was telling the truth,btohqsg
not a Christian but using as analogy,btohqsg

PAP ministers are all elites. they earn so much ofcourse won't empathize with common folks.,btohqsg
then pap increasing gst to 10%,btohqsg
the following yr   shld be 10% alr,btohqsg

take my whole chicken give me back feathers,btohqsg
for imported goods   uk the tax is stacked on top of the overseas sales tax from the respective countries,btohqsg
the thing is there are problems with statistics and the way they are calculated especially with income. the top 1% of sgreans earning 6-7 figures will jack the average up significantly. and I still see many people using average sgrean income to show that living confortably in SG is not that hard,btohqsg
gdp is not an accurate measure of comfortable living,btohqsg
the lky son is useless running a damn circus. only know how to suck money from citizens to fund their 6/7 figure salary.next time they Increase tax  better see them cut their own salary,btohqsg
and stressful. imagine living paycheck to paycheck. if suay suay kena accident 3 months no income I see how they survive,btohqsg
if u see Scandinavian countries  their tax rates 30-60% but they give so much more benefits. They willing to pay those taxes simply because their tax system works.a stark contrast can be seen with US one. Sg not as jialat as that but we shouldn't act like our tax system works damn well,btohqsg
I spend $5 on one meal also heart break,btohqsg
I just comparing US system to Scandinavian systems,btohqsg
both have high tax rates but citizen benefits wise very different,btohqsg
but I also understand la. US need to play power game. their government have to spend on more stuff compared to small powers like SG,btohqsg
always had a love for history,btohqsg
same. it's kinda weird too because we the Ukraine war  we are literally seeing future content in our kids history text books,btohqsg
one of the MP say its possiblr to save 140k in 2 yearsüòÇ,btohqsg
please find this fella name and when he said it,btohqsg
if it's true ah  I have no words alr.,btohqsg
PAP over complacent. citizens need to put them in their place because end of the day  government supposed to work for citizens. Not the other way round,btohqsg
off topic abit ah but if sg goes to war  I can see  many people desert . who would want to sacrifice their lives for our out of touch ministers,btohqsg
