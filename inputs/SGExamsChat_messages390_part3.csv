I donâ€™t support most local companies for such purchases. Many of them are just out there to screw locals.,btohqsg
That â€˜s what most local brands do. They do not even have self-confidence in their brand I feel. That â€˜s why need others to validate for them.,btohqsg
Aftershock like to sponsor local influencers and hence they always say.. Aftershock hooked us up withâ€¦..,btohqsg
