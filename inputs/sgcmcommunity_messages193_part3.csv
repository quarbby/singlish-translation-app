Hi all  first time car owner here. Got a 2nd hand car. Whenever car starts up and i attempt to drive out of carpark  it produces a loud screeching sound which usually subsides a little while after exiting carpark. Able to advice what to do?,btohqsg
Not from tyres  the screech is different sound. Only happens when just start up vehicle and leaving carpark. Dont know if i should go send for inspection :/,btohqsg
Check the serpentine belt and belt tensioner.,btohqsg
Can use bit of water to spray to cfm if noise is from there,btohqsg
Can go workshop check. I've had that before in an old car  pulley jammed. Since it was an old car I just change tensioner pulleys and belt together,btohqsg
