I read it during her lessons cause imo it felt more helpful than wtv was taught during gp,btohqsg
"Funny thing is I didn't even try hiding it LOL and the moment she noticed she went "" ooh what's that? Oh for gp is it ? Does it help"" "" ya"" *stares a bit  nods her head and walks off*",btohqsg
Also I forgot I wanted to respond to this,btohqsg
The only real benefit of ej is new campus,btohqsg
I firmly believe that the grades have nth to do with the ability of the teachers but more of just we naturally get stronger students,btohqsg
TJ is still the sch with the best chers IMHO,btohqsg
Guys you know I just realise  I kinda look like amos yee,btohqsg
TJ getting harder and harder pein,btohqsg
This is also why sugaresque has decent distinction rates,btohqsg
From what I heard she doesn't accept,btohqsg
idk y i always misread as squarespace,btohqsg
was she the 1 got called out for plagiarising?,btohqsg
I like what the signs says and you look into the distanceðŸ’€,btohqsg
This is why there's only one good,btohqsg
But he has comparable distinction rates to other places,btohqsg
n said she had a team behind her,btohqsg
i kinda wanna do this with physics ngl,btohqsg
Which is fucking cheap for tuition,btohqsg
I see she is already training to become a future minister,btohqsg
that has to be sarcasm bruh,btohqsg
damn and i thought i was lowballing myself at 30/hr,btohqsg
my current 1s charge 40/hr lol,btohqsg
Being from RI = a free pas to success,btohqsg
I'll charge 10/hr after I grad,btohqsg
youâ€™ll need to pay people to hire you,btohqsg
You didn't hire me when u needed therapy,btohqsg
Si Yan will go to Josh for therapy,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a mix la. Otherwise the mean RP ranking will simply follow the L1R5 intake ranking exactly but it does not. Schools do study how much they value-added their students  mostly on individual subject basis,btohqsg
Uk I didn't know disc ppl can talk like that until they talk like that,btohqsg
But at least in ej I feel it's mostly cause of the students themselves,btohqsg
My cher openly told us their poor grades,btohqsg
And they are the worst of my few chers lol,btohqsg
i mean to me itâ€™s like 90% the students and 10% the teachers,btohqsg
Maybe being a sociopath helps me acing that job,btohqsg
Also cause EJ does banding based on L1R5,btohqsg
ye dam interesting how NJC isnt that high up,btohqsg
the strong students have their ways of doing well even with shit teachers in my experience,btohqsg
wonder how tj continues to be so competitive  was it after new principle or smth?,btohqsg
Well  of course it may not be equal contribution by the students themselves vs teachers,btohqsg
Wonder how sp dropped in poly position,btohqsg
No but in the eyes of the public,btohqsg
iâ€™ve always viewed teachers as just another learning resource students have access to,btohqsg
I made it to the finals of a international competition before to represent SG,btohqsg
itâ€™s just the most convenient one,btohqsg
But I got replaced in the team because I wasn't from RI,btohqsg
And they wanted a full RI team,btohqsg
It was 3 RI + me,btohqsg
And I got replaced for this,btohqsg
But itsojay we live laugh love,btohqsg
I know at least 2 RI students with no character,btohqsg
