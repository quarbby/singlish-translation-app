Anyway  just want to share about the Franklin US Opportunities Fund. Based on back testing since the inception of the fund  the net return of the fund (based on the fund report NAV) consistently outperform the gross return of S&P500. If purchase through 0% sale charge platform  this seems to be a decent fund to considerHas anyone looked at it,btohqsg
Welcome to post 2.8bil and counting money laundering case in Singapore. The bank have all the right to ask for this  that’s why Singapore is no nonsense when comes to corporate governance. We should be proud that they are doing this  any nonsense funds will be weeded out 👍🏻 I think it’s just tedious for you  but for long term stability and safety 🙏🏻,btohqsg

This is my Webull Rewards page  don't see the USD 3000 reward reflected 😭,btohqsg
because they still have to track ur total withdrawals till 31st Dec in order to determine whether you'll be entitled to the USD rewards,btohqsg

Any experts know when will Standard Chartered SMART credit card points expire? Is it 3 years after card is activated?,btohqsg
Any links to see what to spend on for CIMB CC? thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Don't think it's wise to spend for the sake of spending  unless u want to buy vouchers (eg ntuc) that you know you will use,btohqsg
For the sake of getting the iPad  hv to find ways to qualify.. public transport alone can't hit.. 😂,btohqsg
Not worth if just spending for the sake of it 😂,btohqsg
Ok la..ntuc groceries easily spend $200-300 lo,btohqsg
Online ntuc vouchers counted as spending?,btohqsg

i have sg bank stocks with tiger and i understand i’ll incur the cost too.. is there a way to move out? i have stocks with standchart which is not ideal though…,btohqsg
Payment at Fairprice using Fairprice app is online or contactless payment?#evol,btohqsg
Yes you can transfer them out  at 100SGD+ per stock. 🥲 Might be more worthwhile just selling and re-buying them. They aren’t going to make it easy for you to leave.https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/help/detail/shares-transfer-out,btohqsg

Guys got a Q.Tml my 6mth Tbill will mature  it will goes back into my bank CPFIA account.I wanna apply for the coming 1yr Tbill  do I need to transfer back to CPF first or just leave it in my CPFIA?,btohqsg
actually i got a legit question for this video on $300k cash strategy.. if you have $300k  wont it be better to put 200k in OCBC 360 account?At 200k  OCBC 360 account gives u additional 2.4% interest?Salary + Save + CC Spend + 200k Grow = 2.5% + 1.5% + 0.6% + 2.4% = 7%?isn't this like the highest and safest method as compare to money funds? Of coz under the basis that OCBC doesn't collapse... or m i counting it wrongly?,btohqsg
Hi all  i have a qn regarding DBS rewards redemption to miles.Understand each redemption is $25 for minimum 5k block.For example if i redeem on 10k block  will it become $50 ? or still $25,btohqsg
Thank you for reply  means quantity no matter how much i choose is still $25 right ? 😀,btohqsg
Yup. Still $25. Note the total will be $27 cause there's $2 GST,btohqsg
Has anyone put any money into StashAway guaranteed?,btohqsg
His $137043 parked with webull till 31 December 2023 is earning more. Its earning extra 14.4% / annum on top of Fullterton sgd returns (currently around 3.7% / annum).,btohqsg
yeah the webull one is OP  but the rest can be park in OCBC 200k? haha,btohqsg
For uob one acct if paynow 1.6k as sal qualifies?,btohqsg
Funds in Webull's Moneybull can be invested in stocks etc without any delay and still be eligible for the USD 3000 promo. This is the attractiveness of cash management accounts. Our local banks run into problems sometimes and it is not guaranteed we can have immediate access to our funds should we need to deploy them urgently in the stock markets. OCBC increase transaction limit need to wait for 12 hours  not ideal for war chest funds.,btohqsg
OCBC 7% EIR only applies to the first 100k  regardless of total deposit. Above 100k gets 0.05%. Therefore deposit of 200k will only get EIR of 3.525% not particularly attractive,btohqsg
If buy online opt for installment using dbs wwmc  still eligible for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Count wrongly. EIR for 200K in OCBC will be less than 100K in OCBC.,btohqsg
Oh is it? please enlightened me..,btohqsg
