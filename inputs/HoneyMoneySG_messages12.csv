I see  thanks for the information,btohqsg
But you can go buy the vouchers  and then use it to pay for your groceries on the spot.. So just a slight hassle.. But can properly make use of Kris+ with NTUC :),btohqsg
Do u know the rates for kris+ miles to the voucher?,btohqsg
The standard kris+ miles to $ valuation,btohqsg
Meaning? Some is 3mpd   6mpd 9mpd,btohqsg

Hi all. New to credit card game. Which is the best card for miles accumulation? Just started working and trying to grow that. Looking to purchase some apple products soon also,btohqsg
I don’t think I spend a lot actl. Less than 1k a month? With occasional spending like buying of the Apple products this month,btohqsg
less than 1k can consider hsbc revo,btohqsg
if no fixed spending pattern choose those with no min spending requirements per month.,btohqsg
also  u have decided that miles instead of cashback is more suitable for you?,btohqsg
Ok I will look into this. Thank you!,btohqsg
Yeah I want to build up miles instead of cashback. I think might be better for the long term? Plus personal preference 😅,btohqsg
but just be aware of those merchants that are eligible for miles! also how long it takes to expire since you will take awhile to accumulate! This card no annual fee also so no harm tbvh,btohqsg
spending is capped at 1k for 4miles/dollar so if your spending big ticket items regularly can consider other miles cards,btohqsg
Use the miles dun accumulate like me. Then covid. Gave up n just go for cash back. They ain't making it easier with dilution n limited openings,btohqsg

Also must spend S$500 in Purchases during the Campaign Period using your Revolut card. So... Bye Bye Revolut for Transport 😭,btohqsg
Other than revoult nerfed which is the other app/card that has cash back for transport,btohqsg
Anyone tried transacting with EzLink MC? Can't seem to use it since noon..,btohqsg
"Does anyone know if Grab Vouchers purchased in the Grab app under ""Gifts"" is counted towards the CRMC $500 to get the sign up gift?",btohqsg

so standchart smart is probably the best for transport moving past sept?,btohqsg

Hi anybody know what’s the merchant code for SingTel bills? Eg for wifi & Tv,btohqsg
Just remember phone app if paid by apple / Google pay is not exactly online transaction.,btohqsg
yea  I thought it was since it's on the app. lucky I only did 1 transaction.,btohqsg
UOB Preferred Platinum Visa not recommended? I feel like there is a gap in my miles game.I maxed the rewards for my HSBC revolution for the month  and needed another card to use,btohqsg
iOS cannot add amaze onto applepay..,btohqsg
I needed a card to fill that gap,btohqsg
I used hsbc and CRMC so far is ok,btohqsg
Kris + with hsbc. Other spend use Crmc,btohqsg
the charge through Kris+ will reflect the merchant's MCC? (eg. dining),btohqsg
then you don't get rewards for HSBC>Kris+ ?,btohqsg
Kris+ is occasional spent for my case . I paid Harvey Norman  Lego all can get the 4mpd. So u need to see what u spend on,btohqsg
Kris+ u need to see their tag at the counter how many miles,btohqsg
oh  so merchant mcc applies to the tx,btohqsg
Read the T&c of the cc,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up shopee pay is considered an online transaction for credit cards?,btohqsg
i think most cards exclude similarly to grab pay?,btohqsg
it is  but prob excluded from rewards as it is a wallet top up,btohqsg
So it isnt worth to top up shopee pay using credit card?,btohqsg
yea amex or uob cashback should be ok,btohqsg
If I apply for the Cashback (minimum spend $800) and I apply for a supplementary for my family member  will it contribute to the minimum spend? (e.g. 2 pax spending $400 monthly)Currently doing this with the uob one for past 2 years and wanna switch. Thanks!,btohqsg
hihi   btw anyone knows if i withdraw from syfe / Webull in USD to DBS multiplier acc  will there be any fees ?,btohqsg
Isn’t it standard that sup cards contribute to the main account  after all it’s 1 account,btohqsg
Is that the same for DBS WWMC?,btohqsg
I don’t think so leh  coz I think the tx is considered mobile contactless if it goes through apple pay or Google pay on the phone,btohqsg
Nope. DBS app recognises it as Online/In-app. If its considered mobile contactless  then UOB PPV and VS would earn 4mpd through kris+ too,btohqsg
i thought the UOB cards do earn it,btohqsg
VS shouldn't earn it on kris+. PPV would earn for specific online categories on the PPV whitelist,btohqsg
How much are u looking to spend Monthly?,btohqsg
It's contactless payment. Not online payment,btohqsg
Unless it's in App payment. Similar to Frank card,btohqsg
The case for kris+ is that it’s Apple Pay through an app  no tapping of phone on terminal. So what type is this?,btohqsg
That’s what I thought  but milelion says that my Citi rewards won’t get rewarded.https://milelion.com/2022/08/07/review-citi-rewards-credit-card/Unless there is some exclusion that we don’t see.  I’ll wait for my statement to come to verify,btohqsg
If it's online it won't be segregated as online and contactless transaction,btohqsg
Anyone here have like dbs vintage card?I don't meet thr 120k annual income but is there like a way to get it via secured credit?,btohqsg
Think they are very strict about 120k now! Didn't come across any dp about secured credit,btohqsg
How do I check whether a transaction on CRMC qualifies as a transaction for the sign up promo? I'm paying everything through amaze if that makes a diff,btohqsg
Follow the rule of thumb where if you can get the headline cashback/rewards  meaning non-excluded transactions  it will be eligible. Except Grabpay wallet for Amex tcb,btohqsg
Can I pay my monthly giro income tax with grab MasterCard via e-Axs?,btohqsg
same question  if we're already on the giro plan for income tax  do we need to cancel the plan to pay via axs  or will they recalculate the amount payable per month?,btohqsg

https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page?So at least total$800 per month for the selected catagory to enjoy the 8% Cashback,btohqsg
Wondering if buy from Nike is considered sport or retial catagory,btohqsg
Wondering this is better over Maybank fnf ? since it say cover all ?https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-platinum-visa-card.page?,btohqsg
This Maybank Visa never say simply go wondering ifis cover's,btohqsg
See b4. U choose 5 right. So 1 cat only 200 cap like that.,btohqsg
this can be used for insurance... that's the plus,btohqsg
maybank fnf 8% for selected categories  depends which one suit the better or get both?,btohqsg

Hi I’m thinking of applying for the UOB krisflyer as I’m travelling at the end of the year  the website mentions that “online spending include card transactions made at fashion websites…..”   what about non fashion websites such as Apple website or Lazada/shopee ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the 10x points for crmc applies for purchasing giga! dollars?,btohqsg

Now visa card can be used to top up amaze card? Any better visa card to pair up now for cashback,btohqsg

I applied through the link on singsaver website but I spoke to CS  and they told me I applied through Citi online. Does this mean I’m not eligible for the gifts?,btohqsg
i subscribe ssb since may but seems interest keep increasing  is it good to cancel the early bond that i subscribe and subscribe new one since give higher interest ?,btohqsg
I think payout is every 6 mths right so it makes more sense to remove those that already given payouts. Else u gng spend 4 bux withdrawing and putting back and no interest,btohqsg
i think interest will still be given prorate if we redeem before 6 months ? CMIIW,btohqsg
how is this compared to citi cashback +,btohqsg
Yea they very anal about this one. Gotta see via which method is the better. I missed my prestige promo which wld be much better through citi online instead of singsaver that time. Smtms singsaver is better. Gotta be wary before sign up,btohqsg
Hmm yeah. Now seems like Citi said it wasn’t through Singsaver. But I applied through the Singsaver link. Not sure what seems to be the issue,btohqsg
What is the best card to use for travel related spending? (Eg booking hotel or destination tickets via Klook)thanks,btohqsg
Has anyone signed up for the SC Smart Card via Singsaver as well? Between this and Citi CB+  in terms of spending for dining and transport  SC would be better?,btohqsg
is better apply directly in SC website if u want 300$ cashback with no min spend,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no min,btohqsg
Means they will allocated $300 cash back even without using the card at all?,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no minSingsaver is $300 for $500 spendSo best option would be SC direct for the cash back  followed by money smart?,btohqsg
Not sure if this SC card is a better option than Citi CB+,btohqsg
Yep upon physical card activation.Moneysmart get extra $20 if you are going to spend $500 regardless,btohqsg
But let’s say if I apply through moneysmart and somehow bank says not eligible for the moneysmart promo  I’ll be eligible for the bank one eithe way right?,btohqsg
Sorry  first time on the cash back. So the $300 cash back will be allocated upon activation. Can then use it to pay off bills for the next month right? Not tied down to anything?,btohqsg
You might want to call the bank and check  I'm just conveying info as per what is stated on the various websites,btohqsg
Ah alright. Thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
Anyone tried to pay with axs with trust card?is it possible to do it?,btohqsg

Can I check for citi rewards + instarem amaze card if I were to make an overseas payment at the hotel do I get the miles pts?,btohqsg
Thanks  going overseas but unsure which miles card would be good for overseas spending eg. Hotel booking?,btohqsg
But i will be paying physically at the hotel  will I still earn miles with wwmc?,btohqsg
Any good card for these case  overseas contactless spend on hotel payment?,btohqsg
Guys  if topup too much into ezlink pay by wallet.How to get it out?,btohqsg
Call their hotline request refund  but your acc will be deleted  and the process takes quite long  1 month alr and my money still being processed,btohqsg
Can get it out by topping into another wallet then topping back to grab which is transferable,btohqsg
anyone tried UOB PRVI on expedia with shopback for 6mpd + cashback?,btohqsg
U have to go thru their uob link for it so I don't think can stack,btohqsg
Ooo interesting  nvr tried before so not sure if it works,btohqsg
i wouldn't mind trying if I get my miles,btohqsg
cashback as bonus  don't have then nvm,btohqsg
Yea  shopback tracking is usually quite accurate (and also shitty at times)  take cashback as bonus then 👍👍,btohqsg
i wanna try  but scared i compromise my miles,btohqsg
(D) This promotion is not valid in conjunction with other offers  discounts  promotions  e-vouchers e-coupons  privileges or purchase of gift certificates  unless otherwise stated.,btohqsg

Hello is UOB one account good? Heard if salary giro and spend min 500 montly can get good rebate/interest.,btohqsg
DBS Altitude? UOB Lady’s Card & UOB Lady’s Solitaire with Amaze? HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
UOB 1 good for your 75-100k tier of your savings. 3.6%. So if u have 100k  u can put there  and earn 2 345 int total.,btohqsg
look for cards with travel cat. If I may  milelion has a good guide,btohqsg
But i think i put all 100k into S&P500 ETF earn more then that.,btohqsg
Thanks  thinking of signing up dbs altitude for hotel & Citi reward +amaze for overseas/local spend,btohqsg
If you're going with Altitude  best to book online if possible. 10mpd is quite sick,btohqsg
but hotel price in kaligo more expensive that other,btohqsg
I tried every single one i know and it got declined.,btohqsg

Dbs live fresh vs uob evol  which is best as a card mainly used for online shopping?,btohqsg
Or is there other good alternatives,btohqsg
This is updated 2 hours ago.... Where there's smoke  there's usually a fire.,btohqsg
2% of all age 55.... not a lot leh... if they do something that impact only 2% of age 55 (not even whole population) ... I doubt our gov has time for bigger issues,btohqsg
But seems like live fresh can use for public transport at 10% cash back right,btohqsg
But uob dosent seem like it? And the cap for each category for uob evol like more troublesome,btohqsg
yes and it is very easy to meet min spend of dbs live fresh as there is very few exclusions for the min spend (though may not have cashback).,btohqsg
Evol weem like need tomeet a min spending right,btohqsg
Hmm 🤔 Dbs live looks not bad vs hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Any white list for dbs live I saw it put all contactlessly and on-line payment,btohqsg
Can use live fresh and link to Samsung pay it will get the rebates from merchants that accept Samsung pay right,btohqsg
Coz I usually use Samsung pay to pay for public transport and merchants who accept Samsung pay,btohqsg
If live support Samsung pay it should be,btohqsg
can provided not excluded from rebate in the TnC,btohqsg
Guess I need go dig up the exclusion for live DBS,btohqsg
The live DBS 10% is not bad for simply go,btohqsg
Hsbc Revlon is bad for simply goScb smart simply go is not bad,btohqsg
Hmm dbs live vs posb every day,btohqsg
Hmm 🤔 Dbs live exclude utility payment 0.3,btohqsg
yah  no 5% but count to min spend,btohqsg
Ya look like min soend $600,btohqsg
If use dbs live fresh for transport but don’t hit min $600 can still got the 5% cashback?,btohqsg
all credit cards like that hahaha unless stated no minimum spend requirements,btohqsg
Most Cashback card wirh high %% got min spending,btohqsg
If not it's a tiny % in Cashback,btohqsg
Or special catagory like SCB smart,btohqsg
The Maybank fnf is quite close too But min spending $800 I recall vs  dbs live but it seem it's covered utility,btohqsg
