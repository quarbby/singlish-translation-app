Meaning? Some is 3mpd   6mpd 9mpd,btohqsg

Hi all. New to credit card game. Which is the best card for miles accumulation? Just started working and trying to grow that. Looking to purchase some apple products soon also,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think I spend a lot actl. Less than 1k a month? With occasional spending like buying of the Apple products this month,btohqsg
less than 1k can consider hsbc revo,btohqsg
if no fixed spending pattern choose those with no min spending requirements per month.,btohqsg
also  u have decided that miles instead of cashback is more suitable for you?,btohqsg
Ok I will look into this. Thank you!,btohqsg
Yeah I want to build up miles instead of cashback. I think might be better for the long term? Plus personal preference üòÖ,btohqsg
but just be aware of those merchants that are eligible for miles! also how long it takes to expire since you will take awhile to accumulate! This card no annual fee also so no harm tbvh,btohqsg
spending is capped at 1k for 4miles/dollar so if your spending big ticket items regularly can consider other miles cards,btohqsg
Use the miles dun accumulate like me. Then covid. Gave up n just go for cash back. They ain't making it easier with dilution n limited openings,btohqsg

UOB Preferred Platinum Visa not recommended? I feel like there is a gap in my miles game.I maxed the rewards for my HSBC revolution for the month  and needed another card to use,btohqsg
iOS cannot add amaze onto applepay..,btohqsg
I needed a card to fill that gap,btohqsg
I used hsbc and CRMC so far is ok,btohqsg
Kris + with hsbc. Other spend use Crmc,btohqsg
the charge through Kris+ will reflect the merchant's MCC? (eg. dining),btohqsg
then you don't get rewards for HSBC>Kris+ ?,btohqsg
Kris+ is occasional spent for my case . I paid Harvey Norman  Lego all can get the 4mpd. So u need to see what u spend on,btohqsg
Kris+ u need to see their tag at the counter how many miles,btohqsg
oh  so merchant mcc applies to the tx,btohqsg

Anyone knows if topping up shopee pay is considered an online transaction for credit cards?,btohqsg
i think most cards exclude similarly to grab pay?,btohqsg
it is  but prob excluded from rewards as it is a wallet top up,btohqsg
So it isnt worth to top up shopee pay using credit card?,btohqsg
yea amex or uob cashback should be ok,btohqsg
If I apply for the Cashback (minimum spend $800) and I apply for a supplementary for my family member  will it contribute to the minimum spend? (e.g. 2 pax spending $400 monthly)Currently doing this with the uob one for past 2 years and wanna switch. Thanks!,btohqsg
hihi   btw anyone knows if i withdraw from syfe / Webull in USD to DBS multiplier acc  will there be any fees ?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it standard that sup cards contribute to the main account  after all it‚Äôs 1 account,btohqsg
Is that the same for DBS WWMC?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so leh  coz I think the tx is considered mobile contactless if it goes through apple pay or Google pay on the phone,btohqsg
Nope. DBS app recognises it as Online/In-app. If its considered mobile contactless  then UOB PPV and VS would earn 4mpd through kris+ too,btohqsg
i thought the UOB cards do earn it,btohqsg
VS shouldn't earn it on kris+. PPV would earn for specific online categories on the PPV whitelist,btohqsg
How much are u looking to spend Monthly?,btohqsg
It's contactless payment. Not online payment,btohqsg
Unless it's in App payment. Similar to Frank card,btohqsg
The case for kris+ is that it‚Äôs Apple Pay through an app  no tapping of phone on terminal. So what type is this?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I thought  but milelion says that my Citi rewards won‚Äôt get rewarded.https://milelion.com/2022/08/07/review-citi-rewards-credit-card/Unless there is some exclusion that we don‚Äôt see.  I‚Äôll wait for my statement to come to verify,btohqsg

How do I check whether a transaction on CRMC qualifies as a transaction for the sign up promo? I'm paying everything through amaze if that makes a diff,btohqsg

Can I pay my monthly giro income tax with grab MasterCard via e-Axs?,btohqsg

I applied through the link on singsaver website but I spoke to CS  and they told me I applied through Citi online. Does this mean I‚Äôm not eligible for the gifts?,btohqsg
i subscribe ssb since may but seems interest keep increasing  is it good to cancel the early bond that i subscribe and subscribe new one since give higher interest ?,btohqsg
I think payout is every 6 mths right so it makes more sense to remove those that already given payouts. Else u gng spend 4 bux withdrawing and putting back and no interest,btohqsg
i think interest will still be given prorate if we redeem before 6 months ? CMIIW,btohqsg
how is this compared to citi cashback +,btohqsg
Yea they very anal about this one. Gotta see via which method is the better. I missed my prestige promo which wld be much better through citi online instead of singsaver that time. Smtms singsaver is better. Gotta be wary before sign up,btohqsg
Hmm yeah. Now seems like Citi said it wasn‚Äôt through Singsaver. But I applied through the Singsaver link. Not sure what seems to be the issue,btohqsg
What is the best card to use for travel related spending? (Eg booking hotel or destination tickets via Klook)thanks,btohqsg
Has anyone signed up for the SC Smart Card via Singsaver as well? Between this and Citi CB+  in terms of spending for dining and transport  SC would be better?,btohqsg
is better apply directly in SC website if u want 300$ cashback with no min spend,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no min,btohqsg
Means they will allocated $300 cash back even without using the card at all?,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no minSingsaver is $300 for $500 spendSo best option would be SC direct for the cash back  followed by money smart?,btohqsg
Not sure if this SC card is a better option than Citi CB+,btohqsg
Yep upon physical card activation.Moneysmart get extra $20 if you are going to spend $500 regardless,btohqsg
But let‚Äôs say if I apply through moneysmart and somehow bank says not eligible for the moneysmart promo  I‚Äôll be eligible for the bank one eithe way right?,btohqsg
Sorry  first time on the cash back. So the $300 cash back will be allocated upon activation. Can then use it to pay off bills for the next month right? Not tied down to anything?,btohqsg
You might want to call the bank and check  I'm just conveying info as per what is stated on the various websites,btohqsg
Ah alright. Thanks for the advice!,btohqsg

Guys  if topup too much into ezlink pay by wallet.How to get it out?,btohqsg

Dbs live fresh vs uob evol  which is best as a card mainly used for online shopping?,btohqsg
Or is there other good alternatives,btohqsg
This is updated 2 hours ago.... Where there's smoke  there's usually a fire.,btohqsg
2% of all age 55.... not a lot leh... if they do something that impact only 2% of age 55 (not even whole population) ... I doubt our gov has time for bigger issues,btohqsg
But seems like live fresh can use for public transport at 10% cash back right,btohqsg
But uob dosent seem like it? And the cap for each category for uob evol like more troublesome,btohqsg
yes and it is very easy to meet min spend of dbs live fresh as there is very few exclusions for the min spend (though may not have cashback).,btohqsg
Evol weem like need tomeet a min spending right,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î Dbs live looks not bad vs hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Any white list for dbs live I saw it put all contactlessly and on-line payment,btohqsg
Can use live fresh and link to Samsung pay it will get the rebates from merchants that accept Samsung pay right,btohqsg
Coz I usually use Samsung pay to pay for public transport and merchants who accept Samsung pay,btohqsg
If live support Samsung pay it should be,btohqsg
can provided not excluded from rebate in the TnC,btohqsg
Guess I need go dig up the exclusion for live DBS,btohqsg
The live DBS 10% is not bad for simply go,btohqsg
Hsbc Revlon is bad for simply goScb smart simply go is not bad,btohqsg
Hmm dbs live vs posb every day,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î Dbs live exclude utility payment 0.3,btohqsg
yah  no 5% but count to min spend,btohqsg
Ya look like min soend $600,btohqsg
If use dbs live fresh for transport but don‚Äôt hit min $600 can still got the 5% cashback?,btohqsg
all credit cards like that hahaha unless stated no minimum spend requirements,btohqsg
Most Cashback card wirh high %% got min spending,btohqsg
If not it's a tiny % in Cashback,btohqsg
Or special catagory like SCB smart,btohqsg
The Maybank fnf is quite close too But min spending $800 I recall vs  dbs live but it seem it's covered utility,btohqsg
