Hi guys  I did the UOB Lady's Solitaire application by SMS. May I know how to check the status of my application? Cheers and Merry Christmas!,btohqsg
What did you spend on? Are they eligible transactions?When you applied  the card  did you provided correct Krisflyer membership number?,btohqsg
Have to wait for them to get back. At least that was what I did. I tried calling the call centre and they also told me to wait previously.,btohqsg
So I'll just be expecting an SMS/call then?,btohqsg
I wasn't asked for membership number  majority are eligible transactions,btohqsg
Hello  may I know how long did you wait for them to reply u via sms ? Cus it‚Äôs been over 5 working days,btohqsg
How do they know your Krisflyer account number?,btohqsg
I thought I can link it up through the app but there isn't this option,btohqsg
Chat with UOB CSO what is your Krisflyer account number in their record.,btohqsg
on a related note  has anyone tried to topup Ezlink Master A with Ezlink Master B?Somehow one of my humans has a significantly larger balance than the other.. LOL,btohqsg
hi i got a cpf qn. if i top up 8k to my mum who is 70+ age now  i get tax relief. but can she withdraw it from her RA readily to use as allowance?,btohqsg
I took me almost 7 working days,btohqsg
Does 10X citi rewards card paired with amaze work for online attraction purchases? (Gardens by the bays ticket),btohqsg
is she at FRS already?The catch is this (based on my old era rules):1. you can only topup to your loved ones if they are below FRS2. they can only withdraw from the RA if above FRS,btohqsg
she met her FRS but i can still do top up to her RA. i did a 600 topup just last week because govt sent a mailer saying will match dollar to dollar up to 600,btohqsg
as she's 70+  her FRS back when she hit 55 was only 94-95k.,btohqsg
Before age 55  you can top up your SA to the prevailing FRS.Once you turn 55  and your RA is opened  you can top up your RA to the ERS. The BRS is meant to provide you with monthly payouts in retirement that cover basic living expenses,btohqsg
My first application it took them more than a week to reject it. Cos i was an existing uob card holder  so they used my income from years ago when it was still below 120k. Then they send me instruction to update my income  after that i reapply and they approved it in 3 days.,btohqsg
ah it seems after RA is open  you can topup to ERS.But if i am not wrong  you will not be able to withdraw the topup amounts (will show as Reserved). You should however  be able to withdraw the amounts above FRS from the original pool.,btohqsg
thanks MT  in this case  it sounds like it works.,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/growing-your-savings/saving-more-with-cpf/matching-grant-for-seniors-who-top-upnow it is so confusing... above FRS yet will get matching dollar for dollar topups if 'invited'?,btohqsg

Hi guys  dumb question. Is it possible to use more than 1 contactless payment on the phone? Let say google and samsung pay together in a single phone?,btohqsg
yea my mum's RA is at 87k  i doubt i can do this 8k top up for many times also. govt is plugging alot of holes,btohqsg
not really a loophole i guess  since the amount is reserved,btohqsg
true. anyone has experience withdrawing from cpf RA. i did a trial $10 but its been 1wk   nothing receieved yet. haha,btohqsg
"yes. Can enable nfc setting ""tap and pay with open apps""",btohqsg
