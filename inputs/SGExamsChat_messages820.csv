"Uh try   ""Sorry I'm busy now  will attend when I can""",btohqsg

ig shopee didnt want to give me that $3 voucher,btohqsg

Why did Discord leak into here.,btohqsg
Why is someone’s user ‘IMH Patient’,btohqsg
But i would pay for mc if i really need it…going to sch / work when i cant function is pointless (actually nvm i actually went to sch with a fever before coz i tot i was cured but it spiked mid lesson💀),btohqsg
He legit fucking siao one if u think tele is bad u haven't seen Discord,btohqsg
The place even Kuro and Bedok lost,btohqsg
Bruh i dunnid to see what he type  i alr know he is siao,btohqsg
Looks like he indeed need to seek help,btohqsg
Wait but fr what matcha sent  why someone asking abt mc then he brings up dk what diarrhea thing,btohqsg
He treat the discord as his mental diary bruh,btohqsg
lol. i feel so poor rn.,btohqsg
Legit got one time Ash go type u know this one not your diary rite,btohqsg
He uses the channel as a diary,btohqsg
So he goes on and on when no one is replying?,btohqsg
You should go to discord and see it... its like watching Van Goghs mental state and his journal entries before he cuts his ears off,btohqsg
Neh i can already imagine it,btohqsg
U could have just done it yourself.,btohqsg
Oh u mean the IMH patient?,btohqsg
Chinese high school had the lowest score,btohqsg
Dw this is a once in a 50 years listing..the Singaporeriver has not seen a apt beside it since 1995,btohqsg
Should add another rule into Tele. Dis one not discord keep the Delulu separate,btohqsg
Question.. lestin should I take a mod whose medium of instruction is Mandarin and Cantonese because it matches the content of a mod I want to transfer?,btohqsg
I can speak in broken Mandarin..,btohqsg
Hello Jun Wei how is your day,btohqsg
Why never invite me I wan sleep also,btohqsg
We should have a sport called competitive sleeping,btohqsg
The person who sleeps the most wins,btohqsg
Sleeping Yoga just sounds like sleeping with extra steps,btohqsg
That one u need to fill in a report for each mattress tested and u need to be experienced enough at being able to discern nuanced sleep technologies,btohqsg
Also what happens if the mattress designer is thethe design is very humanguy u gg,btohqsg
Sleep the most or sleep the longest,btohqsg
Because id win in both categories easily,btohqsg
Depends.. does the subject have to be alive?,btohqsg
Ready for juicy silkworm rendang or crispy salted-egg crickets in Singapore?Singapore could be allowing the sale of 16 species of insects as food as early as next month  say some restaurants and farms:https://cna.asia/3xJhlahWould you eat insects for dinner?,btohqsg
When mfs think that Singapore’s cuisine isn’t Asian enough so they gotta do the job of making it more Asian,btohqsg
i actl kinda wanna try the crickets though,btohqsg
A coroner's inquiry found that the 4-year-old girl  who died in River Valley accident  dashed out between 2 stationary cars before she was hit.➡️https://bit.ly/3zgmWFJFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Ye I saw that news..what even more worse is the maid was explicit told to not take the route she did,btohqsg
2 stationary cars?? Was it a red light for the cars or something?,btohqsg
They jay walked  so no traffic light,btohqsg
i went out to exercise and didn't bring wallet,btohqsg
It was two cars on one side of the road  she walked between the front and back of both cars into the other lane..where the driver could not stop in time,btohqsg
Shld i just walk in rain,btohqsg
But it’s also not the driver’s fault after all  if you jaywalk and get hit by a car then it’s on you,btohqsg
But can’t blame the 4 year old  she’s so young,btohqsg
Yep  btw the maid is still with the family,btohqsg
As a driver  even if it is not your fault  they will come and throw some bs like ‘u drive too fast’ or some shit,btohqsg
There was once 2 cyclist suddenly appeared in front of me  luckily i was driving slowly coz entering a carpark,btohqsg
So yea not the driver fault,btohqsg
It's always the blind corners that catch drivers,btohqsg
Im surprised the maid is still employed w the family,btohqsg
Neh i was turning left into the carpark  they were cycling straight in the road in front of me…and then treat the road as their road,btohqsg
Are they not gonna investigate the maid?,btohqsg
They said base on coroner finding will decide if any actions need to be taken against the driver of the maid,btohqsg
Im all wet cause walking in heavy rain,btohqsg
i walk halfway when it became lighter then suddenly become very heavy,btohqsg
where? no rain and hotter here,btohqsg
I can go with u if u can find,btohqsg
Matcha above: i actl kinda wanna try the crickets though,btohqsg
i got scammed when i found out theres actually no fried insects in thailand,btohqsg
She confirm go with her parents one,btohqsg
the article says House Of Seafood,btohqsg
but must be those baby crickets,btohqsg
cyclists always think they own the road tsk,btohqsg
imagine up charging for fking insects,btohqsg
i was gon go Malaysia to eat durian,btohqsg
kudasai very cute what no meh😍😍👏👏,btohqsg
but alot of my friends follow their poly page,btohqsg
they dont even follow any other schl...,btohqsg
Republic Poly is very good at social media... unfortunately they forget to improve their system la.,btohqsg
The only good thing about RP is it's not ITE,btohqsg
come to sp we have better food,btohqsg
fr ( I didn’t watch the video),btohqsg
If it's the same course Hnitec vs Dip in RP the person will be a dumbass to choose ITE,btohqsg
No not depends U will be dumb to not do the other one,btohqsg
i like the nasi padang at fc4,btohqsg
the chicken rice was good too,btohqsg
so im not sure if things changed,btohqsg

Yo guysMy uncle (thats rlly sus) but usually gives us allowance cause we broke as hell is asking me to open a bank with him cause I js turned 18He’s being really pushy about it :(He said if I dowan open bank with him he won’t give us allowance anymoreBut I find it super susWhat are your thoughts?,btohqsg
If he's being so pushy abt it it's legit damn sus,btohqsg
Opening a bank shld be harmless right,btohqsg
Problem is if anyth go wrong,btohqsg
Wait r U also a j2,btohqsg
I can't wait for tmr my god,btohqsg
It’s been troubling me for super long,btohqsg
Isok I got 2 papers tmr🤡,btohqsg

WTF IS BIO EH CB KNN FUCK EDUACTION,btohqsg
EVERYDAY ON 4 HOURS OR 5,btohqsg
bruh tdy is my chem paper,btohqsg
LITERALLY PAIN EH I COME HOME I SIT THERE ALSO CANNOT STUDY ONE WTF,btohqsg
I DIDNT EVEN FINISH THE PAPER,btohqsg
Issok mid years is they delibretly set a hard paper to give u a 'wake up call',btohqsg
IDC THOSE WHO CAN DO THE,btohqsg
Idt TM ever sets hard paper........,btohqsg
u should see my math paprr 1,btohqsg
no jc really sets hard paper,btohqsg
i gna get it in 3 weeks time,btohqsg
there will always be enough questions to pass,btohqsg
I can send U my mye paper too aft I get it bavk,btohqsg
My regret was after every A level paper  i come home lie down on floor cry…instead of studying for next day paper  please dun follow suit,btohqsg
I'm mostly resting aft papers tbh,btohqsg
Idk I'm just tryna survive rn,btohqsg
Hmmm i dun recall a super hard one…if u study  should be ok,btohqsg
Chem seemed to made alot of ppl go wtf,btohqsg
Dun look at reddit after A level paper…a big no no and big regret,btohqsg
Do they still show the people scoring > 80 / 100,btohqsg
I recalled praying each time before exam lol,btohqsg
Oh  mine econs  phy  and chem showed top students,btohqsg
Meanwhile…in jc my teacher had more confidence in me than i had in myself,btohqsg
I think the hardest paper i tried was ASR / TJC,btohqsg
RI’s paper was surprisingly easy (for me),btohqsg
tons of practice gets you the Atons of practice + talent gets you the super high A-- which is still just an Ano practice + talent gets B or lowerno practice + no talent= repeat,btohqsg
for Maths ah. OK la still doable for me,btohqsg
Wait i tot chem compulsory in jc sometime ago,btohqsg
my time physics was the compulsory one,btohqsg
in fact even now  chem is only really needed for Medicine  Dentistry and maybe Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,btohqsg
I cant imagine phy being compulsory,btohqsg
mine was before H2 was introduced,btohqsg
I need some updates on courses also,btohqsg
Chem is not pre-req for Chem Eng I think,btohqsg
Which means  why even make chem compulsory?,btohqsg
I think the CPDD folks see Chem as the central science,btohqsg
While it is not pre-req for most courses  it helps one to bridge to either of the other two,btohqsg
some maths qn during my yr,btohqsg
I got curious abt the shit the kudasai girl post,btohqsg
If u are wondering what i saw that could be that bad,btohqsg
just go to her tiktok and watch a few sht she post,btohqsg
portfolio vs write up issit diff,btohqsg
please lah siah please lah siah majulah majulah,btohqsg
memelinecan I be your sugar baby instead?,btohqsg
Hey a picture speaks a thousand words,btohqsg
does anyone have any kittens up for adoption :) like 4 weeks ish,btohqsg
Growing up is realising squidward and mr krabs were right,btohqsg
Plankton was never the bad guy,btohqsg
The real parasite was the rich all along,btohqsg
@zixli555i found this but if you want more options then maybe try other social media like facebook  carousell(?)  instagram,btohqsg
Hi  i’m Ginger.I was found roaming the streets at a new territory for close to 2 weeks ☹️ The vet said I’m very young  approx. 1 year old! I have a good demeanour - I don’t scratch or bite humans  animals or even furnitures. In fact  I get along well with other cats  but my 4 other house mates doesn’t seem too happy with my existence. I’m very proud to say that I am also litter-trained 🤩I am a full ginger  with really beautiful and long tail and ear. My ear tip is so nicely cut that my temporary mum thought I wasn’t neutered yet and she stupidly brought me to the vet and to her horror  I was already neutered and so  she STARVED ME FOR NOTHING. Also  at the vet  I am tested for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukaemia Virus (FELV) and proud to say that it’s NEGATIVE 😌Please  now  I am looking for a forever home and an owner that would love and care for me for the rest of my life. May I never roam the streets again 🙏🏻If you’re interested  please send me a DM or contact me at90297582🥰,btohqsg
i hated mr krabs all along idk why but he always rubbed me off in the wrong way as a kid,btohqsg
it's because he's just another capitalist ahem,btohqsg
Growing up is realizing Mr crabs married his first love,btohqsg
Dis is me in Uni be like:,btohqsg
Bro constantly planning to steal your bunny,btohqsg
... as if i can go for comp this yr,btohqsg
im js gonna skip trng from now on,btohqsg
Sorry for the inconvenience thank you,btohqsg
tbf  i didn't know i was selected,btohqsg
don't even know when was the last time i went for trng,btohqsg
i last went probably early may,btohqsg
I didn't attend cca for like 6 months before,btohqsg
Either MC or parents letter if asked,btohqsg
i don't even need to give,btohqsg
Most dun give a shit one tbh unless u damn good,btohqsg
why yall go to jcs at this time of the year,btohqsg
Abt half half with like jc admission and the other abt asr life,btohqsg
I wish was more abt asr life,btohqsg
he was dirty minded but he still did homework   was relatively early for sch  and never play traunt,btohqsg
Some SGE discord user who is banned if you all don't know who,btohqsg
me i everytime exam will flunk in one way or another,btohqsg
But then when correcting  others suddenly can do,btohqsg
after this MYE period i just feel,btohqsg
Bro got it but don't match the energy,btohqsg
Don't worry it would be worse after Alevels,btohqsg
I was too.. mainly cuz I was busy with my Diploma,btohqsg
I think cus after A levels I just did solo adventures and stuff,btohqsg
The dread is mainly for Females,btohqsg
They have the prerogative for the freedom of now what?,btohqsg
Meanwhile i see some of them doing internships after A levels,btohqsg
But the after mye parts  I ended up mugging more for A levels,btohqsg
Meanwhile I see like other jc ppl go parties  strip shirtless and drink alcohol like as if they arent J2 and having a levels,btohqsg
That one is to mask the internal sense of knowing they are fucked,btohqsg
Ngl me being wholesome in jc pretty much didnt see the overly toxic stuff,btohqsg
The same thing happens for Y1s in Poly and Uni,btohqsg
GPA will tell u that u are screwed in 1 year,btohqsg
My friends tell me the opposite,btohqsg
They are wholesome but some were pretty much forced or pressured to be toxic at Y1,btohqsg
Na Y4 is them partying for 3 years straight cuz they are already dead,btohqsg
I meant like after Y1 if you get what I mean,btohqsg
After they get a semblance of where they are at on the chart of their peers,btohqsg
Nahhh saw one person in Y1 got pressured to be in hall paegeant and end up drinking weekly during Y1S1,btohqsg
That one is the classic Y1 too much commitment moment,btohqsg
Had this guy at Y4 he has so many CCA and shit gpa saying very hard to juggle,btohqsg
Y1 is quite a pivotal pt,btohqsg
I am like when u graduate in months all your CCA will be gone and youwould be left like a guy after a divorce.. with nothing,btohqsg
"""I contributed to society cus volunteering""",btohqsg
It's when u test the waters,btohqsg
Or just dive in the deep end,btohqsg
Na we don't talk about that,btohqsg
Oh i didnt know abt this story,btohqsg
ngl the thing i want to do in uni is like research,btohqsg
cause ive nvr done formal sci research  before,btohqsg
Which course are you in again?,btohqsg
i actl kinda want to be a research intern at the zoo or smt,btohqsg
me ? im not in uni yet,btohqsg
I mean technically you try interning at a zoo before coming to uni,btohqsg
The lore for SGE discord runs deep.. fun times,btohqsg
And then do research intern during uni studies,btohqsg
this is also the main reason why mid tier - top tier jcs don't do well for As,btohqsg
im planning to volunteer with nparks after promos,btohqsg
cause its kinda related to the stuff iwdo,btohqsg
I am death seeking but not actively suicidal,btohqsg
I portion of me agrees but like I thought these jcs would like filter them out or smth like that,btohqsg
ngl i also consider being zookeeper,btohqsg
How did it went from Zoo to Nparks?,btohqsg
zoo not now zoo is after alvls,btohqsg
eh but seriously who even back reads sge chats these days,btohqsg
U can't lmao Dekita deleted all the msgs of those who are banned,btohqsg
Oh but very good tip right,btohqsg
If you want to apply intern,btohqsg
Can consider nature society tooMaybe can learn how a civil group works with govt agencies,btohqsg
Also now all gone liao reduced to atoms.,btohqsg
Search for these roles/send resumes abour 6 months in advance,btohqsg
I mean if you want to search 1 month in advance also can uh,btohqsg
Then get filtered and wait for the pain,btohqsg
But like I think interns and jobs are harder to find so best is 6 months,btohqsg
So how is your intern ah,btohqsg
Haha my fac supervisor gonna do site visit soon,btohqsg
nparks is cause like the animals,btohqsg
my friend interned there in jan,btohqsg
But they still need to do site visit to see if it matches the descriptions,btohqsg
No  buona is their alumni club...ohhhhh,btohqsg
Only if it's nearby or convenient for em,btohqsg
So basically  i shld have worked at changi airport,btohqsg
I haven't heard shit from my supervisor,btohqsg
Cool. We need more civil groups in various sectors that can do civil-govt partnerships,btohqsg
we had jan internship then i did mine at a pri sch,btohqsg
Yea  it’s a feature for IP students going to Y5. Hope you learnt/experienced something useful!,btohqsg
Today Matcha shall teach you the decorum for Discord communications,btohqsg
It was rly fun to interact with the kids and also learn more about what teachers do,btohqsg
my other friend did hers at semiconductor company lol,btohqsg
then got another person ik did at hospital,btohqsg
Did you all have to find your own attachments or did you all select from offers? If it’s the latter  are students allowed to find their own attachments?,btohqsg
If you go to university and do a science major,btohqsg
And ended up doing honours project,btohqsg
Sure got chance to do a formal but guided science research,btohqsg
you can choose from the list they give you (sign up through the sch because the sch partner with those organisations) or you can find urself,btohqsg
ik someone got connections and intern at the law firm,btohqsg
i also want  to do grad sch so i think is def got chance to do research,btohqsg
Actually most unis are direct honors these days,btohqsg
Just depends on performance can liao,btohqsg
But just being in a Uni is good enough,btohqsg
RAs aren't usually bound to academics,btohqsg
Dooby did you do chem in uni,btohqsg
Given another chance  I would have done grad studies after working for a few years since I did not work in research and grad studies is not immediately requiredI did my masters following my hons because I enjoyed my FYPBut on hindsight  I thought it would have been better for me to work a few years first to figure out what career path I want to take before deciding what I want to do for my masters,btohqsg
I am curious what do chem majors learn in uni,btohqsg
I see  thats a valuable insight. Thanks !,btohqsg
Ye  I was in NUS Chem  FoS which is part of the current CHS,btohqsg
Back in my time  we had compulsory modules that would expose us to general  physical  organic  inorganic and analytical chemistry + lab techniques in first two yearsFrom third year onward there were compulsory lab modules but we could choose other modules that fit our personal interests. That was when I stopped doing org chem altogether and focused on physical and analytical chem. I think I did a module of Inorg chem and disliked it too hahahaThen fourth year we spent most of our time completing a FYP and doing a few random modules. My project was on chemical synthesis of nano particles (specifically  quantum dots),btohqsg
These days  there are more specialisations offered to Chem majors  so my experience is outdated already,btohqsg
Honestly hor  I spent most of my first 2.5 years or so being very involved in student activities related side hustle. Coz I thought my work would require me to not just be good in content knowledge. I was more academically disciplined only mid third year onwards,btohqsg
I was particularly weak in the area of retrosynthesis and it did not help that I did not sit my ass down to study having spent most of my time doing non-academic work instead. I could still cope with the other modules but my org chem suffered from the lack of effort :p,btohqsg
do you think if you went back in time will you be more studious in y1 and y2,btohqsg
No way. I would have studied less hahaha. I was not as talented as some of my batch mates. Between putting in a whole lot of effort to get FCH vs getting a 2nd Upp comfortably + having time to gain exposure in non-acad areas  I definitely choose the latter,btohqsg
U believe the latter still benefitted u more?,btohqsg
Yep. In Year 1  I was a project director and in year 2  I was the VP in my faculty’s equivalent of SCI learnt invaluable lessons organising events  working with various stakeholders  and spent many precious moments being with friends whom I still keep in contact with,btohqsg
I just didn’t think I should spend 100 % of my time on acad if I weren’t planning to go the academia path,btohqsg
Oh ya what are u working as now anyways,btohqsg
But i tot all those merits look btr on resume?,btohqsg
Eh  there are things that can be done for personal growth  not just chalking up a beefier resume bahAnyway  I didn’t need a resume back then also,btohqsg
I think it rlly depends on the company. The time I worked in a tuition content development  the boss asked me for a resume but just hired me without a formal interview,btohqsg
I mean tbh at this rate it was like a mash up of an internship and a part time job,btohqsg
But tbh company also quite small,btohqsg
Imagine if the z____ did that lol,btohqsg
Yea  chose that area cus it is the only rhing I can think of that is close to my major,btohqsg
The Workers’ Party will hold its party conference on June 30 to elect a new leadership team that will take it into the upcoming general election.https://str.sg/7xJJ,btohqsg
Will the cockles be there too?,btohqsg
Actly do ppl view him as a populist?,btohqsg
Populist just means someone who is appealing to the popular opinion,btohqsg
Think about it- if his policies were not popular with the people  why would they vote him into parliament?,btohqsg
I tot more like pandering with all big talk,btohqsg
Populist does not inherently mean bad or good,btohqsg
And not as much actually done,btohqsg
this is not my first job but I shall leave it as this bah (:,btohqsg
I know hiscockles will confirm be there.,btohqsg
Then u have retail be like:Are you a living being?You are hired.,btohqsg
It was more of me doing a zoom meeting.This is the route to the place.You are hired.,btohqsg
Lmao my intern did that too,btohqsg
I am like I can commute.You are hired,btohqsg
I remember during my time (seems similar to yours)  the people who were gods of organic chem… they started working under the profs like since yr1 or yr2. They knew what they wanted wayyyy early.,btohqsg
Ah the good ole days of fighting with 50 other course mates for the IR and UV spec machines so we can gtfo and go home,btohqsg
Ye  there are those who do UROPS in year 2 or 3. Those who do organic UROPS are very hardworking 🫡,btohqsg
How many of those machines R in the labs,btohqsg
Oh for ntu we also have that  but we call it ureca.,btohqsg
Apparently is like we can work with professors from other majors or smth like that,btohqsg
(Depending on req of the project),btohqsg
That’s cool. Can it be an industrial project besides being offered by a faculty member?,btohqsg
Hmm to be fair  I dont think i have heard of anyone doing that,btohqsg
Most i heard is a math(not nie major) student doing a project under nie faculty member,btohqsg
Icic. I think some UROPS projects could have been offered by industry partners  e.g. food science and tech projects could be offered by external food companies,btohqsg
But I’m a dinosaur so my knowledge is very outdated la,btohqsg
I have never done UROPS before,btohqsg
But honours project yes you can actually do with industry partners,btohqsg
Cross faculty also might be possible,btohqsg
URECA can be with partners outside ntu but it'd be labs or research institutes of some kind,btohqsg
Only 1 of each for the undergrad labs,btohqsg
Ah yes it's the same for the SEM lmao if u ever do microscale stuff,btohqsg
At least yall don't have 1 single guys job who is to protect that machine,btohqsg
A construction worker was killed and another was injured in an accident yesterday at the Johor Bahru-Singapore RTS Link station worksite in Woodlands.https://str.sg/orvqR,btohqsg
Im in the train and i must be looking v tired and unwell for an old man to approach me saying there are seats behind,btohqsg
I paiseh but now i regret not going to the seat,btohqsg
Or just a kind old man,btohqsg
I think he saw me sleeping while standing🤣,btohqsg
He was abt to alight then came to me saying there is a seat over there,btohqsg
my guy you expect us to trust a random on telegram advertising services on an sgexam chat group,btohqsg
like no matter what thats just suspicious,btohqsg
@LZW_123why did you thumbs down one of my messages,btohqsg
you may have good intentions but this is Telegram My Dear Sire,btohqsg
🤣🤣 my cousin from philippines also doing these kind of thing,btohqsg
just don't rely 100% on it though,btohqsg
should have bought first class tcikets,btohqsg
Fyi i saw that skyscanner ad on ig before,btohqsg
i cant edit my goodnotes on ipad after syncing it frm macbook,btohqsg
But he (and the skyscanner thingy) does sound very sus,btohqsg
so i was wondering if i have to delete my account on macbook then click restore purchase on the ipad,btohqsg
Did u pay for premium or using it free,btohqsg
Should be fine like that tho? But i use the free version so not so sure abt this,btohqsg
Do yall think sec 4 dating sec 3 is weird,btohqsg
have you tried referring to goodnotes' faq,btohqsg
or sending goodnotes' the diagnostic data of your device which can't edit documents,btohqsg
some dude was advertising air tickets he wanted to sell as a middleman,btohqsg

Gotta do a Robert De Niro,btohqsg

It is not weird but it is inappropriate,btohqsg

Would you consider going to Korea on one of these visas?,btohqsg
"🇰🇷 K-culture Visa 🇰🇷➡️ Korea to introduce a visa for foreign nationals who want to receive training in K-pop  choreography  fashion modeling & other categories of Korean popular culture➡️ Incl. ""K-culture training visa” and ""digital nomad visa""👉 More info:bit.ly/4cGwYOv@goodtofly",btohqsg
>K-culture>Shows NewJeans>Mf half of them ain't even from Korea,btohqsg
Such industry is actually extremely demanding,btohqsg
Plus I feel that Korean working culture is worse than Japanese working culture,btohqsg
Tbh the Jpop industry is kinda messed up too,btohqsg
I wouldn't wanna be in either countries as an artist,btohqsg
I feel whether its outside of pop industry or not  Korean working culture seems worse,btohqsg
I mean the Miracle on the Han River was not possible without Chaebol Consolidation.,btohqsg
They took Japan's Economic recovery and Zaibatsu and thought  hmm good idea lets amp it up to the fucking max and now Samsung is only outmatched by the Government in terms of GDP contribution,btohqsg
Idk if H2 History still covers the Asian Tigers..@aki281307do they still cover Taiwan Korea and Singapores Economic Miracles?,btohqsg
even if so it's prob a y6 topic,btohqsg
this is the syllabus I'm doing,btohqsg
wait i think may be this one instead,btohqsg
Can't tell shit tbh I never based anything from just the syllabus,btohqsg
Check the specimen papers to tell ig,btohqsg
i js learnt that macs stop having their shakes,btohqsg
From August  most students from NUS will get Wednesday afternoons off so that they can take part in out-of-classroom and other student activities.https://str.sg/8na3,btohqsg
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,btohqsg

From August  most students from NUS will get Wednesday afternoons off so that they can take part in out-of-classroom and other student activities.https://str.sg/8na3,btohqsg
A pity for those graduating 😔,btohqsg
i don’t see it as a good thing,btohqsg
Ikr administratively it will not pan out well,btohqsg
This is Uni. You plan your own schedule.,btohqsg
It is only 3 hours of protected time per week  not exactly what I would call an afternoon. There is the caveat that it is for “most” students. Also  the article has explained that some classes would be unaffected  such that those that require special venues like laboratoriesHaving this common protected time may make it easier for students from different faculties to interact and work on things togetherDespite all the uncertainties  I am excited for the future students (even though it has nothing to do with me haha),btohqsg
I mean I am not in NUS. The common protected time is like weekends but in the weirdest of timings  NUS doesn't guarantee hall which means if you have morning classes u would not be able to pack your classes as efficiently with the normal 5 days,btohqsg
Most schedulers will pack their classes so it aligns with the shortest amount of time and the least inconvenient amount of time they have to be in NUS,btohqsg
Wait and see how it goes when it rolls out bah. I’m not sure how big an impact a 3-hour block is on the overall timetable for those who pack their classes,btohqsg
Also it's funny u mention 3 hours because with an administrators mind I can easily see someone with a schedule that has classes starting in the morning then a weird 3 hour gap and then suddenly their evening classes,btohqsg
Wdf am I supposed to do with 3 hours if I finish a class at 1pm and have a class at 5pm,btohqsg
Hmmm I’m not sure if there are evening classes for Y1-3My personal very outdated experience is that there are only 6 pm lessons for honours and graduate students so that we can run our experiments in the day and attend lectures in the evening (and maybe go back lab after lessons — i mean  who needs rest??????),btohqsg
U chem major before rite? How many mods was preallocated or like just for chem students during your time?,btohqsg
Right even it's even worse with the interdisciplinary push as well because you gotta bid for mods outside your school,btohqsg
For most people  an arrangement like this is either insignificant or hurts them more than it helps. 3 hours of protected time won't change anything positively as a whole,btohqsg
imagine class -> sports cca -> back to class,btohqsg
^ yeah it just means more chances for me to have the awkward amount of time thing. I don't just live at the school itself and if given the choice I wanna go see my parents and spend time with em lmao even if it's a few more hours at night,btohqsg
quite a few electives stretch until the evening to not clash with core classes,btohqsg
Then wonders why the mod after your participation grades tank,btohqsg
My experience is no longer relevant,btohqsg
As a whole  I do not know how things will pan out but I think a 3-hour block sounds okayI am reminded by how many schools were very protective towards offering late reporting days citing many many reasons until a few schools made things work well and the rest finally decided to hop on the bandwagon,btohqsg
My point is that It will be less of an issue for restricted majors compared to those thay are common because the pool of slots u are fight for will shrink for common mods,btohqsg
Ye  I get you. That would affect the freshmen and general electives,btohqsg
No the rest don't hop it's more like get dragged when it becomes a university wide policy,btohqsg
there are inter uni games  but usually there's like recreational and competition (aka the varsity team),btohqsg
then there's also joining for hall sports,btohqsg
cause i wanna join a sport in uni,btohqsg
Hall in general is less competitive,btohqsg
cause like i got join clubs and perf arts in dhs but then i kinda want to try sportd,btohqsg
hall side depends on the hall you join,btohqsg
Actl doesnt even need to be like competitive,btohqsg
there are inter hall games but a lot of players are beginners,btohqsg
im ok w joining the recreational one also,btohqsg
I don’t mean to say that those are the exact same thingIt was meant as an example of sometimes we don’t try we don’t know and if we have the resolve  things can work out better than expected,btohqsg
Those are more hall things. Like boggle scrabble are hall games,btohqsg
for reference to how chill hall can be. first time i played softball was in uni and i captained it in hall,btohqsg
cause like the thing is later got a div ppl then they would be very good alr,btohqsg
i just want like a grp of ppl to play with,btohqsg
My hall the captain is kena forced into it cuz no one wanna do,btohqsg
i mean uni ofc will have people that are damn good,btohqsg
like there are people that have played in SEA games,btohqsg
it's also not as intense bc no one is gonna take responsibility for you not showing up,btohqsg
oh my the 2024 american presidential debate 💀,btohqsg
Not even 1 minute in  3/4 of the viewers alr know who won the debate,btohqsg
