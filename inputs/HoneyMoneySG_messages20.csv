Hi gurus  will I get 4 mpd using (CRMC + Amaze) on Singtel & GOMO telco bills auto deducted thru their apps?,btohqsg

I don't have habit pay my bill before receiving my statement  I was thought that as long as not having late payment will do?,btohqsg
it's good not to pay before receiving statement.,btohqsg
see whether can check your credit report online?,btohqsg
I see  first time to heard thatThe thing is the rejection was immediate  means like something wrong 😅,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if youtrip is not able to top up revolut anymore?If not  are there any solutions to withdraw my youtrip balance to my bank account?,btohqsg
I have just having my another credit card approved  POSB everyday  if my credit report got issue shouldn't be the caseBesides  shouldn't be bank also need time to assess my credit score? Haha,btohqsg
since you just got an approval you can get your report for free from credit bureau. you can Google for the website.,btohqsg
Interesting  didn't know about this but any reasons why tho 🤔,btohqsg
I always do that  din have any issue,btohqsg
I read somewhere if you always pay before statement they might wrongly interpret as you signing up for cards and not using them. not sure how true.,btohqsg
Not true i think  just that not as good as a customer as they want to earn all the different fee from late charges  interest etc,btohqsg
Anyone knows when is ocbc 365 credit card cashback credited? My statement date is 1 December  and transactions were incurred in mid November,btohqsg
I face the same issue as well. Gonna top-up to touch n go wallet  as I spend most weekends in KL haha,btohqsg
This is the first time I’m hearing this.Why is it not good to pay before statement?I have the habit of paying maybe bi-weekly into my credit card regardless of statement,btohqsg
I also wanna know why it’s not good haha,btohqsg
Hi I'm trying to find the T&Cs for this  as I only have a POSB Everyday card and want to know if eligible. Could you share where you found it? I'm looking thru the Capitastar app,btohqsg
Can anyone advise how I can redeem Instarem points to cash back?,btohqsg
Issit sounds to borrow from bank to topup cpf sa to get tax relief,btohqsg
I read somewhere if you always pay before statement they might wrongly interpret as you signing up for cards and not using them. not sure how true.,btohqsg
Doesn’t look like any issue to pay your credit card bills early,btohqsg
there are different views by different people. for examplehttps://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/shtb60/truth_about_paying_your_cc_bill_in_full_before/,btohqsg
anyway just want to clarify that I also do not know it's true or not. just a possibility.,btohqsg
more info here. again  I don't know true or not.https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/oyympr/credit_utilization/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button,btohqsg
Hmm  i do check my credit reports quite often  and I don’t think there’s any issues paying ahead of statement(at least in my case)I try to pay for most of my expenses with CC  so paying it regularly  “releases” credits for me to use again 😂,btohqsg
Unless you're using it as a tool to curb your habits etc  perhaps you could look into increasing your credit limit instead?,btohqsg
My credit limit is already at what the bank is giving me already.More of a habit to pay regularly for me,btohqsg
But paying early just takes away potential interest income,btohqsg
I have the same thoughts tooAren't amaze card convert all transection to online purchase and online purchase itself meets the criteria for 4mpd?,btohqsg
That’s true in a way.Perhaps maybe I can tweak my habits a bit out of my own comfort zone,btohqsg
Anyone had issue with the GPMC tap and pay function?  I launch the app and was at the tap and pay page but it still detected my gpay dafult card.,btohqsg
So it doesn’t matter if it’s recurring or non-recurring telco bills right? As long as it’s not travel related expenses  should earn 4 mpd from amaze + Citi rewards card? Just to confirm.,btohqsg
Applied CIMB WMC and Amex TCB at the same time. The former gave 1 month pay limit  the latter gave 6 months…. Both applied via SingPass. Dun understand the logic,btohqsg
You need to set the default tap and pay to grab pay card,btohqsg
Oh thanks! Wa. Like troublesome since this card hardly use  unless MCC not eligible with my main credit card.,btohqsg
Now amaze can withdraw cash overseas also,btohqsg
Means you need to top up right? Anyone know this whole amaze card top up? I only used it for MC proxy,btohqsg
Depend in phone nfcSamsung got a options to set-up as tap to detect on open appSo if I opened Samsung pay it will detect as Samsung pay and not Google pay whichever u didn't open,btohqsg
Beat scenario is deposit 75k in rhb on December. Transfer the 75k to HSBC on Jan . Transfer the 75k back to rhb on Feb. Transfer the 75k back to HSBC on March.,btohqsg
there are different views by different people. for examplehttps://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/shtb60/truth_about_paying_your_cc_bill_in_full_before/,btohqsg
withdraw and deposit both must be done on 1st day every month?,btohqsg
The AI has answered (not me),btohqsg
Hi all! Just gotten my Citi Rewards + Amaze! Can I know what category spend I should avoid paying using this combo? 🙏,btohqsg
Possible to give general examples? 🙏,btohqsg
But that doesn’t take into account credit period given by banks. Say my statement date is 30 November  usually the due date may be 3 weeks from then  say 21 December,btohqsg
That 21 or whatever number of days is free money,btohqsg
Not very significant so to each his own I guess,btohqsg
Think the bank see daily balance on calendar month. So I guess first day of the month should be good,btohqsg
"just saw this very informative video  thanks to everyone for their tips and etc.. on this  may i ask for RHB ""incremental average daily balance""  anyone knows what is this$Xamount that we are looking at?",btohqsg
Bonus of interest will only be paid to the incremental daily balance compared to previous month. The best is to move the entire amount to another bank .,btohqsg
yes  remember to keep at least 1 cent. Need to have money in account when interest is credited.,btohqsg
oh i misunderstood it  ok thanks,btohqsg
Anyone get $5 rebate this month for payment of utilities and telco with Amex tcb?,btohqsg

what if i paynow back to my own account ?,btohqsg

ohhhh i thought the moment you top up to grab you get the cash back already,btohqsg
grab don't allow you to paynow to yourself for balance topped up using credit card. only can scan QR code for paynow with company UEN.,btohqsg
So do I get cashback if topup absolute to grab then pay back the absolute credit card bill via axs paynow with grab?,btohqsg
Okay got it. So i can make payment to company UEN paynow right? Sorry very new to this 😅,btohqsg
yes and only can if got the QR code to scan.,btohqsg
manually type the UEN cannot ah?,btohqsg
cannot. some people say can generate own QR with the UEN but I have not try yet.,btohqsg
interesting.. Thank you so much for the info!,btohqsg
Correct. You get cash back to your amex tcb the moment you top up to your grab,btohqsg
have done it  but i didnt get cash back on this. would someone be able to cofirm?,btohqsg
You will see it in your statement. Not immediate,btohqsg
ohh  so to confirm that we will earn by the following?So do I get cashback if topup absolute to grab then pay back the absolute credit card bill via axs paynow with grab??,btohqsg
You get cash back to your absolute card by topping up grab. But not sure you can pay credit card bill with grab. I haven't tried before .You can try and let me know 😃,btohqsg
I have tried using axs machine to pay for my credit card bill using Grab paynow. Guaranteed 100% confirm + chop can.,btohqsg
Only axs machine can right ? Because I use app cannot pay,btohqsg
Interesting. I assume you loaded the grab pay with an amex?,btohqsg

Hi all  is Paywave by debit card considered NETS/ATM transactions?,btohqsg
of cos not. why this question?,btohqsg
depends when merchant post the transaction. Usually dun post on weekends.,btohqsg
Was wondering how does UOB classify Retail transactions in order to hit the bonus interest rates for UOB One account,btohqsg
ok. Paywave charged to visa/master should be counted so long MCC not excluded,btohqsg
With a pool of money who has experience to share where they park or invest it? FD  shares etc?,btohqsg
After utilising the Amex TCB first $5k  any other use for the card?,btohqsg

I just got a replacement card for my. UOB Abs. Now i cannot link the new card in Grab  anyone got this problem? It says card details not correct even after I entered right OTP to trigger that $ 1 trxn .,btohqsg
Depends if u nd the pool of money in the short term (2-3yrs) or long term (>10yrs)...??,btohqsg

Hi Friends  just sharing.CIMB Visa Infinite if your annual income is below $120k  on website it says can apply with fixed deposit of $50k.Previously i applied online and anyhow key in $120k as my income and shared with them my FD account number but was rejected.Upon contacting CSO  they told me need to go branch and apply as Secured credit card.Go down branch already  they say need to pledge the FD and auto renew yearly  also only for the 12months FD. (Im on the 18months FD  cannot and need to take out and put into 12 months…)Just FYI  in case someone here is interested.To me  i think its not worth the hassle and prefer not to auto renew my CIMB FD annually.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check the easier way to fulfill webull welcome gift?,btohqsg

May I check for the stock/ETF we bought  able to sold right after buying? Or must hold for 30 days as well,btohqsg
Why you need CIMB visa infinite?,btohqsg
In preparation for upcoming T-bill(which is my first)How do you guys actually estimate what is the rate you are going for?I’m not going to lowball  but I want to put in a rate which I can get a good amount of allocation too.,btohqsg

Just curious  How do u come out w 4%,btohqsg
Probably he also going to fixed deposit might as well get the card.,btohqsg
Visa infinite comes with annual three free airport priority pass,btohqsg
Hey guys  for normal monthly basic spending  what would you all recommend for cash back credit card? I’m puzzled between UOB One card and Citi cash back,btohqsg
Citi prestige is way better then for your infinite visa usage.  unlimited priority pass for you and +1.  Every 4th consecutive hotel night is free via Citi concierge but the per night rates are higher,btohqsg
Citibank Cashback wanna claim their Cashback a bit troublesomeNeed to send sms  I cancelled the cb+ and switch to UOB.Not sure if the normal CB is same as +,btohqsg
Cimb visa infinite is zero annual fee for life,btohqsg
Is Amaze excluded from UOB Krisfkyer for overseas dining?  I only saw amaze transit as excluded MCC.I’m basically looking for a card to pair with amaze that overseas dining that is not from Citi/Scb/maybank/cimb.  I only have dbs and uob cards,btohqsg
I did mine 2 days ago in the branch. Secured 50k auto renewal 12 mth fd. If the fd rate next year is very bad  I will cancel the credit card and the auto renewal FD. Cimb infinite credit card can have 3 times free access to world wide airport lounge. No annual fees for this card，no minimum spend required.,btohqsg
Must pay annual fees or to spend a lot to waive the fees?,btohqsg
Can't waive annual fees  or at least unheard of (other than during 2020 when nobody could travel),btohqsg
Per night rates used to be able to use Expedia  but they removed it some time in Oct this year,btohqsg
And they just removed Haute Dining too,btohqsg
"No  Amaze is not excluded. The UOB KrisFlyer card excludes transport spending  which is why the ""Amaze*Transit"" exclusion is there",btohqsg
Hi.. How useful POSB EVERYDAY CREDIT CARD other than 5% capped to 30$ Sheng Siong Supermarket..?,btohqsg
Oic. So seems like cimb infinite credit card is the only foc card with no fees that allow 3 complimentary access to airport lounge in a year.,btohqsg
I prefer Citi as it is not quarter commitment,btohqsg
just bid at least higher than current highest FD rate,btohqsg
U will get the rebate even if u dun hit the min spending...,btohqsg
Can redeem via iBanking or at outlets such as SS  or SPC outlets...,btohqsg
Hey all. I intend to pay my income tax through GPMC-AXS  though I am currently on monthly GIRO deduction. How early do I need to pay the monthly amount through AXS so that I don't get double deduction through GIRO on the 6th of every month?,btohqsg
can i apply for rhb high yeid saving account online?,btohqsg
Can cimb infinite apply for a supplement card and do the supplement card holder enjoy the same benefits?,btohqsg
what the step? it only leave name and email behide 😭,btohqsg
Those on SCB smart if we use to pay apple icloudGoogle one storage will it enjoy Cashback?',btohqsg
What about for hsbc revolution paired with fave? Can still earn 4mpd if used for dining etc? Asking as I just got both citi rewards and hsbc revo this week,btohqsg
Can have supp card. But 3 foc  access to lounge is limited to primary card holder only,btohqsg
Download rhb mobile app and register,btohqsg
By credit score AA  should be ok  but still get rejected by UOB system automatically,btohqsg
oh i thought only for existing user,btohqsg
FavePay will pass down MCC of merchant  so as long as both the MCC code of your merchant and FavePay is not explicitly stated in T&Cs to be excluded then you'll earn 4mpd,btohqsg
For the 6% cash back you mean?,btohqsg
hello all  understand that most is using Amaze/Instarem + Citi Rewards atm. However i'm unable to apply Citi Rewards due to my credit limit etc. Any good alternatives to combo Amaze/Instarem for cashback ? I'm a cashback person so i'm looking for good cashback alternatives since the old strategy of using UOB AMEX + Grabpay (no more grabpoints) isn't so great anymore.,btohqsg
hi all  can i check for uob aboslute cashback  does topping up directly to grabpay counts as eligible transaction? looking to clock the $1 000 for 2 months for the $300 cash credit,btohqsg
Doubt it. Do download the T&C on uob absolute website for this promotion. It says 6540 - stored value card purchase/load is excluded.,btohqsg
what u spend on and how much in a month?,btohqsg
6% cash back only for simply go and fast food and coffee shop isn't it,btohqsg
groceries at NTUC/Cold Storage  Dining at Hawker/Cafes/Restaurants (also use Shopback Pay)  Buying Bread  Buying ebooks  Internet Bill  Electricity/Power Bill  Mobile Bills  Taking Taxis  Internet Shopping on Lazada or Shoppee. Within $800 to 1.5k. My previous combo was use 1) UOB EVOL and 2) GrabCard + UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX.,btohqsg
yes i did  it seems so.. as per (iii) Balance and/or funds transfers;  thanks bro,btohqsg
Think they got put internet payment to Netflix example,btohqsg
So I don't know if this kind of payment to online purchase is consider their MCC?,btohqsg
nope  this card only award for transactions at specific merchants,btohqsg
Oh so this is only for these they specify not mcc,btohqsg
No charge but subjected to the fx diff,btohqsg
I think you can explore a combination of maybank f&f and hsbc revolution. Maybank f&f need to hit $800 min spend per month  hsbc revo no min spend. Need to see which MCCs you are spending on and optimize. Maybank f&f can link to instarem amaze.,btohqsg
I hear from other YouTubers that you can buy n sell the share within 30 days and still qualify for the bonus...,btohqsg
Best to check with webull sg for confirmation...,btohqsg
Withdraw using linked credit card? Wad mcc will it be?,btohqsg
Not sure. Haven’t tried. This new feature just came out few days ago,btohqsg
2% fee though. Is it worth it?,btohqsg
You have to withdraw from your Amaze wallet.,btohqsg
Best to empty the account on the last day so the account will be back to zero for the 1st of the coming month,btohqsg
Anyone having problem logging in to amaze app?,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm this?The website states no spend exclusion.,btohqsg
I'm looking to purchase an engagement ring around 2.5k  the best cash back card to use for this would be UOB one at 3.3% cash back minimum  is it?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if Peppermint buffet at ParkRoyal is under MCC code for restaurant or hotel?,btohqsg
Have anyone received $5 cash back for Amex purchases for dec for utilities   online shop and telco?,btohqsg
Hi all! Is there an alternative solution to grab pay after the nerf? Or yall still gonna using grab pay?,btohqsg
Restaurant under hotel usually is hotel mcc,btohqsg
also  it's 3.33% only if you spend exactly $2000 for the 3 consecutive months.,btohqsg
I see  ok I get it. So if I spend 500 1000 2000. I will get 500 at 3.33% only,btohqsg
the 3 consecutive months also need to follow your account and not every 3 consecutive months.,btohqsg
yes and if you accidentally miscalculate  BBQ lor.,btohqsg
note cycle might not start on 1st of the month. check your billing cycle. also need to check which month the 3 months start to count. mine is Sep  Oct  Dec. so if charge Dec  Jan  Feb 2k but Mar charge 0  it's zero and BBQ lor.,btohqsg
no prob. I have been utilising the card so quite familiar. the cashback was much better. next year I changing strategy.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I ask if any invested in SG bank stock? Is it better than saving in FD/SGS/SSB?,btohqsg
Which strategy you going to adopt?,btohqsg
hi all  for hotel bookings on agoda orbooking.com  do you recommend i swipe the DBSWWMC to earn 4mpd?I have the HSBC revolution but afraid i might’ve reached the $1000 spending this month.TIA!,btohqsg

Yeap  I got some voucher as well for new sign ups,btohqsg
I don’t have that card  it’s too late for now haha. Planing to propose on 1st jan,btohqsg
I did. I will rather use either Revolut/Wise and withdraw my SGD 350 equiv from fee free ATMs (plenty of them in Europe  America and other places)  or think about partner ATMs: Westpac ATMs in Australia for farmer market shopping (Westpac and DBS-POSB have a longstanding partnership)  UOB in Thailand and so on,btohqsg
anyone knows if UOB preferred platinum visa is see pay date or post date?,btohqsg
Im assuming the item is considered a luxury good. Can use the CIMB World MC which gets you 2%. Then use UOB Abs to pay via GPMC which gets you another 1.7%. Total 3.7% cb. Now also got CIMB Xmas sign up offers.,btohqsg
Make sure you check if got mall promos,btohqsg
Wow  will keep this in tab for the next purchase. Thx ☺️,btohqsg
My understanding is posting date in calendar month.Say I want to get a new red shirt for LNY on 31 DecTransaction posts 2 Jan or thereaboutsIt will be counted for January bonus points cap.,btohqsg
i see  so the limit of 1110 per month is transaction date?,btohqsg
Not really. For UOB PPV it is posting date of calendar month.Not to complicate things but my understanding Of UOB VS is  it's posting date of statement month.Trust and OCBC: Posting date of calendar month.DBS: Transaction date of calendar month.,btohqsg
Can I know Citibank Rewards is under which?,btohqsg
The left one - points. ThankYou Points.,btohqsg
1 month max bonus is 9000 points.. equally to $20 dollars?,btohqsg
But UOB 1k spend each month = $33.33.. it is better right?,btohqsg
only if you spend exact $1000. if you spend more it's less percentage,btohqsg
I normally use HSBC advanced after 1k.,btohqsg
to summarize/ add on a little of differences between Uob visa signature & uob PPVUOB PPVboth local and overseasmobile contactless transactionswill qualify for 4 mpd  capped at a maximum of S$1 110 percalendar month.UOB VISA SIGNATUREThere is no such restrictions for the UOB Visa Signature. You can either tap thephysical card or use it via a mobile wallet (mobile contactless)to earn 4 mpd.This is subject to a minimum local spend of S$1 000 per statement month  and capped at S$2 000 perstatement month.😊 just to take note,btohqsg
Whats the best credit card for big ticket spending on gym equipment (around 5k),btohqsg
Hi about uob one when I call them to ask about the cut off date for the card it say 12th every months but when I go to internet banking unde uob one bank account activities it says10th,btohqsg
It say combined spending from card as. Of 10 Dec,btohqsg
So does it mean mine uon one cutoff day is 10th of every month to earn the extra cash back - interest,btohqsg
If you talking about min $500 card spend to clock for bonus interest on uob one account  it is by calendar month. I believe you started the uob one account on 10th Dec? Subsequent month will be 1st to end of calendar month.As for quarterly rebate on the uob one credit card it is based on statement month. If your statement date is 12th  then spending posted between 13th to 12th next month is counted to a statement month. It may take a few days for transactions to be posted so should try to make the spend earlier. Need to clock tiered spending and min 5 transactions in all 3 qualifying statement months to get the quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
Still puzzling so I follow the uob one cut off date at 12_13th tfo enjoy the quarter rebate right so mine last day to spend is 11th & if spend in 12th it will be considered as next month?,btohqsg
Then the uob one bank acc min $500 spend ti clock bonus interest I can ignore?,btohqsg
Hi all  any clue if i use Amex tcb > Grabpay > AXS for credit card bill  will I still be able to get the 1.5% cashback?,btohqsg
Couldn't I call in to ask uob to adjust both the bank acc & uob one statement cut off dates to match?,btohqsg
I’m not sure  but I think I read it before on hwz somebody tried before.I might be wrong.My dates also don’t sync but I just live with it  I think it’s negligible for me,btohqsg
So I need to try to Match spending $500 before the 10th of every months for the extra interest?,btohqsg
U are referring to UOB ONE savings or UOB One CC?Both works different,btohqsg
I'm trying to see if can earn both,btohqsg
Dunno how to match it as both diff date,btohqsg
Unless I call on to ask to change the uob one cc to change to same date as the UOB one savings,btohqsg
Do share your findings? I would be interested to know too if there’s a successful precedence  then maybe I can try my luck too 😂,btohqsg
If I don't call in to askMaybe u suggestions I try spend $500 before 10th of every month and after 12th is consider next months,btohqsg

The cashback comes as credit to your card in the following statement cycle,btohqsg
I see it like a bill repayment credited in after i paid the current one,btohqsg
"Could i ask if we use DBS WWC in some restaurants that has ""QR code"" menu and payment via apple pay on the spot  would it be considered ""online spending"" for 4mpd too?",btohqsg
I think can just direct use the card if using shopeeBut do check  taobao might have Cashback for Instarem if it’s foreign currency spend.I’m not into taobao so I’m not very sure,btohqsg
Or after 1k on uob one on hsbc Revo?,btohqsg
What a healthy hobby. Financial prudence screw it lol... We'll never know!If you legit own a business  charge them all to the SQ HighFlyer Card - if they accept Amex. Or ask if they accept PayPal even if it means you spend to pay on Amex. 1.8 mpd I think?If you haven't hit the min spend for automatic fee waiver  you might give OCBC or Maybank credit cards a go.If not  just use any 1.2 mpd or 1.6% card lor.,btohqsg

Hi all! Anyone know buying attraction tickets (Christmas Wonderland) under Klook/Trip is considered under the “Travel” category?Planning to use the CRMC + Amaze so trying to see if I can get 4mpd for this purchase,btohqsg
Seeking kind help for clarification! 🫡,btohqsg
If you can  i would recommend not to. I cannot be 100% certain  but i spent on Klook buying restaurant vouchers and i didn't get the 10X points 😢,btohqsg
Wondering which card let u earn points from paying to online subscription like SpotifyGoogleAppleI know Disney and Netflix scb smart allow but not all,btohqsg
Is this a place where I can ask about insurance also?,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 new customer  is it first mth won’t get the SAVE interest?,btohqsg
What card to use for klook payment? HSBC revo?,btohqsg
10k from the 10x points  anything more is just 1x,btohqsg
Rumors has it that Shopback codes Klook voucher as Restaurants  so you may buy them and use on Klook. Personally I have not tested so YMMV,btohqsg
I called their hotline in sg and apparently abit unsure abt their customer service quality really,btohqsg
Hi all  I notice fave pay can’t use the universal sg QR code.. other than grab pay  liquid pay the best?  I using ShopBack app to pay also if they have.For kopitiam and hawker payment,btohqsg
Personally I go in this order  if first one don't have I move on to second one etc.1. Shopback Pay2. FavePay3. LiquidPay,btohqsg
Fave not so popular at my hawker leh. Many don’t accept,btohqsg
All deposits in RHB are insured by SDIC by up to $75k,btohqsg
LiquidPay is more widely accepted than FavePay,btohqsg
Time to say bye bye to coins,btohqsg
Cashless the way to go lol,btohqsg
sadly still got some shops don't even accept Nets or PayNow  have to pay by cash... haiz,btohqsg
Unless it is very urgent to get the stuff from the shops  usually I’ll skip the shop and go elsewhere to get my stuff.,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to get miles (amaze+citibank) through topup of youtrip?,btohqsg
I would think it’s excluded.MCC is still the same. I might be wrong,btohqsg
so i guess the best way is to get UOB absolute 😅,btohqsg
easy to test  can top up minimal amount and 2-3 days later can see get point or not. Not like HSBC or DBS that need month later to check,btohqsg
how do i see whats the minimal amount to get point? 😅,btohqsg
or you mean minimal topup to youtrip,btohqsg
But like no gifts now if you are a new signup,btohqsg
Thanks  what do I get signing up through this link?,btohqsg
Ah okay so I should wait till they are offering gifts then I sign up?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are new to bank,btohqsg
YouTrip cannot use GPMC to top up ready.So cannot get 1.7%,btohqsg
tks! hv anyone tried RHB high yield savings account?,btohqsg
do you know of anyway to get any rewards to topup into youtrip?,btohqsg
Hmm currently don’t have  at least not that I know of.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know the interest for UOB bank is paid monthly?,btohqsg
Wonder how often the interest rate changes?,btohqsg
hv anyone tried RHB high yield savings account?08:18 PM,btohqsg
how to maximise the return? either at one go put in as much money as possible? when is the interest given?,btohqsg
but my query was more on how to MAXIMISE the profit? if u have any hacks on that?,btohqsg
and I know first 75k insured by SDIC. If anything more than 75k what would happen if smthg happens?,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there any guide on UOB ONE acc and which UOB cc is best to pair with UOB ONE acc?,btohqsg
Hi does paying your SP services (spgroup) via AXS app with the amaze card (paired with Citibank rewards card) grant you the full 10x miles rewards?,btohqsg
depends which one suits u better,btohqsg
is there any where to give example of how UOB one acc calculates the first 30k etc,btohqsg
as in calculate average daily balance?,btohqsg
What i want to know is if i put in 100k today  do i still need to keep increasing the monthly incremental for every month moving forward?,btohqsg
In regards to the UOB ONE acc,btohqsg
So i only need to do this once and i will keep getting 7.8% once i can fulfill every monthly spend,btohqsg
hmm where did the 2% go to?,btohqsg
7.8% only applies to the 75k-100k. anything below 75k earns lower interest.,btohqsg
Right so if i put in 100k  i can get 7.8%. is there admin charge?,btohqsg
if u put in 100k u get 5% effective on the 100k.,btohqsg
I would say in order for MAS to allow rhb to setup consumer category banking there must defintely be some form of safety nets set aside to be able to operate here. Yes i agree to trust your money up to 75k if u not ready but 75k cannoy qualifying for pp account. So need to individually weight the risk,btohqsg
What about Citi rewards card. Do I still get 10x rewards on the axs app?,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB one acc min spend $500. Can debit card top up grab pay?,btohqsg
cant help but be skeptical to put much in non local banks,btohqsg
Hi  im planning to get the amaze + city rewards combo  and have a few qns.If I topup my youtrip card with amaze  does it give 4mpd?If i pay insurance with amaze  does it give 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone use instarem amaze caed with visa?,btohqsg
If i topup amaze wallet with visa  does the credit card count it as spending? For e.g using uob one.,btohqsg
Amaze can only pair with mastercard,btohqsg
You can topup amaze wallet using visa card,btohqsg
I Heard UOB has been excluded from CardUp payments and would not earn points  is that true??,btohqsg
Any promotional code to open RHB account?,btohqsg
Many card exclude AXS payment and utilities payment for bonus rewards.Personally I am using UOB absolute for utilities. 1.7% cash back.,btohqsg
uh  refer to their promo page lah,btohqsg
If you need the tax relief then better to do VCMA now. If no need then dosent matter,btohqsg
Question: I top up 8k for my parents CPF  can i still topup SA or MA for tax relief and by how much?,btohqsg
Was wondering if my dad earns more than 4K monthly  and I do voluntary top up of $8k his SA account  do I still get tax relief on this $8k? Because I see a $4k cap for spouse and siblings top up.“To qualify for tax relief for cash top-ups made to your spouse or siblings  they must not have an annual income of more than $4 000 in the year preceding the year of top-up (e.g. salary or tax-exempt income such as bank interest  dividends  and pension) or be handicapped.”,btohqsg
RSTU-SA 8K to parents only  thats on top of the 8k you can top-up to yourself,btohqsg
thanks chris. meaning i can topup 8k (max) to my MA?,btohqsg
and get additional 8k for the tax relief right ? thanks,btohqsg
CPF top up SRS and donation could be a hot topic for the next few weeks. 😂,btohqsg
Does it include UOB PRVI? I see that UOB PRVI doesn’t exclude,btohqsg
yea seems not excluded. Never tried though cause dun think worth the cardup fees to get the points.,btohqsg
Got a questions. Considering i have $75k-$100k savings in bank.1. Between UOB One Savings and OCBC 360  which earns the highest interest without fulfilling the $500 on credit card. (Salary  giro fullfill only),btohqsg
Assuming you have $100k in savings  OCBC 360 will give you $212 per year while UOB will give you $50 per year,btohqsg
both the websites have calculators u can use to find out yourself,btohqsg
What payment methods do you all use for hawker centre?,btohqsg
I got the values from the calculators,btohqsg
Assume I spend & giro I guess uob better,btohqsg
Amex pay use the universal QR code also?,btohqsg
Yes  just make sure Amex logo is there,btohqsg
ok thanks! i think no need tax relief for now.,btohqsg
I hope UOB or OCBC come out with a mastercard instead of visa. Heavy usage on amaze card linking directly with mastercard. Currently both uob one and ocbc 360 is VISA. Hence cant hit minimum $500 if spend in Singapore only.,btohqsg
Still looking for alternatives. Uob lady mastercard only for ladies.,btohqsg
Amex pay only for Ames issues not uob Amex ya it's accept SGQR,btohqsg
No more discounts on nestia yeah.,btohqsg
Amex pay is the last options,btohqsg
Does Liquidpay count as online/contactless for 4MPD for HSBC Revo?,btohqsg
amex pay can earn what ah.grab pay still got 1.7% Cashback from topup from UOB AMEX + chance at 25k coins.,btohqsg
paying direct with Amex TCB (not sure if UOB Abs Cashback has it)  at least wont have funds stuck inside Grabpay..,btohqsg
Only applies to amex pay via amex app,btohqsg
Only 1.5 from amex TCB not from grabGrab Already nerf into oblivion,btohqsg
Grab still good to pay for insurance and AXS transactions paired with UOB Amex.,btohqsg
Uob amex user still can top up grab eaen 1.7 to use grab to SgQRWhen grab and Amex Nerf top up benefitsThe amex issues card can use amex pay via amex pay is the lasts resortUob amex will be left to nonna,btohqsg
LiquidPay  like Amaze  converts transactions to online,btohqsg
If no more 1.7 if u use top up to grab uob amex will be wasted,btohqsg
Feel amex issue usercwill have last laughs when grab & amex no morei Cashback when top up so uob amex wioll affect the mostBut Ames issued user still can use sGQR,btohqsg
If amex grab no more can use what other cc recommend to pay insurance,btohqsg
They also slow in giving back the cash back. Amex is same mth give back,btohqsg
Yes I haven’t see my UOB Cashback,btohqsg
I was not aware when I apply for the cash. Cuz Gian the extra 0.2%,btohqsg
Now like not worth the effort lol,btohqsg
UOB Stash would give you around 500++ per year without the need for salary,btohqsg
Might as well go for Singlife or SIF GoSavers in that case. $1500 and $2500 respectively,btohqsg
Uob amex other than grab pay top up seem like no other use case,btohqsg
Agree... Once it is nerfed... I will cancel uob amex,btohqsg
Just link your Mastercard or Visa card in the app... Similar to amaze...,btohqsg
The norm is to link to which card for hawker?,btohqsg
I would normally use dining cards,btohqsg
Any mile or Cashback card that gives u rewards for dining...There's too many to list down here....,btohqsg
Or any card that you've been using...,btohqsg
Any promotional code for me to use for RHB registration?,btohqsg
Question for the experts - what would you do if you are 24 yo  SEP and trying to increase tax savings? I was taking opinions from different sources and this should be the method that I am taking.1. Top up to MA (tax savings and hit BHS ASAP)2. Top up to SRS (tax savings and invest)3. Top up to OA (housing in the future and invest)4. Only top up to SA in the futureWould love to hear the community's suggestions.,btohqsg
What’s the best credit card for high purchases?,btohqsg
Will never sign up starhub again... Cancel their plan. Still have fibre service disconnection fee.,btohqsg
No. Finish. It is not early termination. No contract still charge extra.,btohqsg
Are you already registered as SEP with CPF & IRAS? This will then determine your tax relief eligibility as a SEPFor myself I will prioritise VCMA first to hit BHS. Some prefer to do VC3A as a SEP to bump up OA  or  RSTU-SA as well,btohqsg
Yup! I’ve registered as SEP a year ago,btohqsg
Also  can I check my relief eligibility via IRAS  account?,btohqsg
Look like they having this issue quite some time. You can Google search fibre service disconnection fees. Forum and fb posts.,btohqsg
You can check under CPF  then Self emoloyed section. If you're registered then you can access it,btohqsg
OCBC 360 holders  can I check  if the interest credited for Salary is based on current month or previous month?Current month I have more pay coming in but I have lesser interestLast month I have lesser pay but more interest.,btohqsg
Depends on your tax bracket though  if it’s not very high  SRS doesn’t quite make sense,btohqsg
Top up Medisave Account is cool  go for it,btohqsg
Mm.. how much then it will make sense to do SRS?,btohqsg
The higher your tax bracket  the more you should feel incentivised to part your money that long ya,btohqsg
If it’s me  i will just take 8k tax relief by topping up MA,btohqsg
I might consider topping up May parent or spouse cpf,btohqsg
SRS when you’re older (nearer to retirement age and salary higher) then use ba,btohqsg
So young.. take some course (invest in yourself) get certified in whatever field you’re in  got tax relief for courses also leh,btohqsg
that really depends on your tax payable. SRS max tax relief is 15 300,btohqsg
You may try to contact their customer care to waive. Couple of years back I managed to get it waived ~30S$,btohqsg
Anyone knows the MCC for fourstar mattress physical retail store?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wanted to ask are shopback and fave entitled for miles on HSBC revo?,btohqsg
It's a long shot  I suggest u shoot them an email on their website...,btohqsg
I made a transaction before but how do I see the MCC in my Jun statement? It only states fourstar industries in my Citi e statement,btohqsg
CC statements do not show MCC codes... U will need to ask the retailer about it,btohqsg
Would you guys rather Top up to MA or top up to srs and invest it ? (assuming 7% returns on s&P 500),btohqsg
For me  I will max out CPF before going to SRS,btohqsg
And go for amex issued best,btohqsg
Anyone into health insurance for private hospitals recommendations which brand's and plan to go,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB one account. Understand that paying insurance premium via UOB one CC does not earn me any rebate/cashback. However  can i confirm if they are part of the $500 min card spend to earn the bonus interest?,btohqsg

Hi all  I'll be paying hotel in Malaysia upon check-in. What should I use?,btohqsg
It took HSBC to process and approve myHSBC Revolution Credit Card  i forgot what exactly is this card best used for in Dec 2022 onwards?🤔,btohqsg
Hi all  do credit card has inactive fee charges?,btohqsg
no  there is annual fee though,btohqsg
I set aside some cash for topping up MA next year January…,btohqsg
But now I very scared go higher than 4 percent,btohqsg
Should I top up next year Jan,btohqsg
You can consider implications on your tax as well to determine your risk of missing out. As in if you top up within this year  you may potenyiay gain more tax relief.,btohqsg
Well I can still get the tax relief as long as I top up before Dec 2023.,btohqsg
Ah I was alluding to contributing End of 2022  my bad.,btohqsg
Oh 2022 already topped up liao,btohqsg
Not sure what is the question here,btohqsg
Interest might be higher than 4 percent,btohqsg
Best is UOB Lady Travel with amaze  but not everyone have,btohqsg
Watch my sponsored segment of the video,btohqsg
You can lock your DBS card and transact it which will be declined. Then use DBS Chatbot to check declined transactions on credit card. it will show the MCC,btohqsg
Then just use any card the rewards contactless spend e.g. Live Fresh  EVOL  365  PPV  VS and not excluding travel,btohqsg
Has anyone ever paid for their Pru insurance premiums through iPay using GPMC as the card for payment? Assuming it the amount is less than 5k  did the one time deduction go smoothly?,btohqsg
ya I am also curious how long it took,btohqsg
Interest rate is fixed for CPF whereas SRS is tax relief short term but you would need to pay tax 50% when you withdraw at retirement age.,btohqsg
During that time  i got 2 ocbc and 1 uob active already,btohqsg
Yeah. Im not the only one. I rem reading someone here waited over 3mo as well,btohqsg
No. Let the payment fail . Use axs,btohqsg
May I know from the date of approval to delivery of the physical card was how long?,btohqsg
That's unfortunate. All right  thank you,btohqsg
I see  was it a recurring payment or one-time manual payment?,btohqsg
Havent received the card yet physically. After application last end of sept   i got an sms in late oct telling me that due to volume of applications  the processing will be delayed. No news until last week via sms and email that my card is approved and the physical card will be sent this week,btohqsg
I think I applied for it for the 200 rebate for first 500 spend within 1 mo,btohqsg
Same here. I just got an sms last week telling me the exact same thing. So most likely next year liao lol,btohqsg
Will it still be valid? The promo is only until dec,btohqsg
Anybody tried generating SGQR to pay merchants using their uen (to pay via Grabpay)?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  currently i using liquidpay with CRMC. If i using liquidpay with hsbc revo  will i also get 10x for revo? Thanks,btohqsg
I suggest if you're playing the miles game  best to consolidate into 1 mile card  unless you've busted the limits of other cards... Else there'll be quite abit of effort tracking and transferring of points...,btohqsg
focus on either Altitude DBS or Citi Premiermiles ? Good thing both cards points don’t expire and are 1 mile kinda cards. My spending now focus on 1 miles more than must have 4 mpd opp Liao (if no Cashback opp),btohqsg
hm  like that need to spend 3-4 times more to get same amount of miles??,btohqsg
Hi  yes mostly i am using the CRMC but this month already burst the $1k limit so checking whether can use liquidpay with HSBC for 10x miles,btohqsg
Gd morning all  may I ask if I tag my HSBC Revolution card to Liquid Pay  and make payment to food court / hawker centre stores. Will I earn 10x points under eligible MCC code  5812?,btohqsg
Or u could give this a try,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGthe cpf contribution $37740 translates to $102000 income a year does that means it is not advisable to top up medisave let’s say coming Jan. Since if a person knows his annual income amount is more than that.,btohqsg
Incorrect because VCMA and RSTU are separate limits from the 37 740,btohqsg
Liquidpay *with Hawkers should be 5814 Fast food  still eligible,btohqsg
"Food court consider fast food ?""",btohqsg
Depends on what u value more  personally love the miles game so I track my spending with Amaze + CRMC and HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Added clarification  for hawker centre payments,btohqsg
Food court i dont know  usually use food court apps/card,btohqsg
I thought we will have no need of WhatCard. We have to ask DBS now …,btohqsg
Possibly. They can’t beat 8% cashback on FnF (most of my spending can be covered on FnF already),btohqsg
There's no more public transport promo from Revolut right? For existing users that is,btohqsg
Suggestions use cc card promo for simple go,btohqsg
Like food junction and kpitam card,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  hit my max 1k spend on CRMC tagged Amaze. Looking to use HSBC Revo for daily food expenses. I think food court got visa / MC  so might as well use contactless payment to pay for it?,btohqsg
Ya some food court accept paywave,btohqsg
https://fs.fldfs.com/iwpapps/pcard/docs/MCCs.pdfMCC code list  might be useful,btohqsg
any cc good to book air flight,btohqsg
How about shopback and fave? If i make payment via these two platforms but using revo credit card  are those transactions still entitled for 10x rewards?,btohqsg
Uob KF cc for SQ flights esp those above 2.7K  HSBC Revo or WWMC for other flights,btohqsg
Hi all if I use liquid pay tagged uob 1 card is the eligible for cashback?,btohqsg
So it will count as online transactions? And depends on transactions i made such as foods  drinks?,btohqsg
MCC must be under HSBC revolution whitelist to qualify for bonus points,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we use the instarem amaze and link it to the standard chartered true cash back card  will we get the cash back from Standard chartered also?,btohqsg

How can I check the MCC of the transactions? I can’t see any from statements,btohqsg
can only check with hsbc cso,btohqsg
Hello guysUob one account with salary alone what is the interest rate?,btohqsg
Think is 0.65% (same as spending 500 alone) based on my User interface.. (SAL done but transactions not posted yet),btohqsg
For instarem amaze  the 1% cash back would be in points right? So we would need to spend 2000 to get the 20bux? Am planning to use the card to pay for my hotel overseas( around 1000 sgd ) any other cards/tips would be welcomed,btohqsg
Just called uobNeed to have credit or debit card first+ Salary than have high interest rateSalary alone don't have high interest rate,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing too... Think if wanna do pure salary  just put in OCBC,btohqsg

Hi all! If I got a high purchase to do  which are the best cc to use? Since HSBC REVO and Citi Rewards got caps,btohqsg
Shopping? Try looking at OCBC Titanium,btohqsg
Let say buy iPhone for 1.7k,btohqsg
DBS WWMC or OCBC Titanium should work for apple online stores,btohqsg
Can i tag uob absolute to simply go for public transportation?,btohqsg
I think SimplyGo don’t accept Amex,btohqsg
Can subscribe to sc smart for simplygo,btohqsg
Simply go purely SCB smart is best top of the tierUnless u got other spending other card like UOB one got bonus to %% on simply go besides the basic tier of 3.33,btohqsg
WWMC buy from KrisShop via Kris +,btohqsg
You won’t get more 4 mpd beyond 2K spend for air tickets w WWMCBeyond 2.7K … UOB SQKFCC 3 mpd beats the miles earning of DBS WWMC,btohqsg

Hi all  just curious if anyone have any suggestion or idea how to lower property tax?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if there's any point in using amaze for simplygo after linking with Citi Rewards? Seems like transit related transactions are not eligible for the 10X,btohqsg
ohhh 2.7*3 ok got it i was wondering why specifically 2.7,btohqsg
I called UOB to ask about my CC application. They say average processing time is 2 weeks. FYI.  Till now not approved yet but haven’t 2 weeks lol,btohqsg
Much faster if you have existing card i think  i applied just three days ago  on Sunday  and yesterday it was approved.Now just waiting for the physical card!,btohqsg
I have 2 existing card leh,btohqsg
That's odd...did you try to login your ibanking and check if the card is showing in ur account yet?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards excludes air tickets from 4 mpd so I didn't mention them. As for WWMC any online purchase will do.,btohqsg
For air tickets below 2.7K  I'll get 8K miles from the 4K miles plus 0.4 mpd after $2 000,btohqsg
I never got a cc card ffom uob but mine was approved and send card within 1week+,btohqsg
Ya Try login to your uob app it will show the card if it approved,btohqsg
If transit related transactions are excluded then no point linking to Amaze. it'll still be excluded,btohqsg
Hey guys  Those using UOB absolute Amex. How do u guys pay the bill? I’m having problem doing it though DBS ibanking. Can’t seem to add the card. It shows invalid,btohqsg
I often pay using FAST. I treat UOB Abs card as if it's an UOB account. If need to pay bill  I transfer to UOB Abs card from any bank account lor.,btohqsg
Ah  I was trying the ‘pay card bill’ function,btohqsg
If dbs cant pay your uob just use axs,btohqsg
Don't need to  bank transfer will do,btohqsg
Haha they feel I got too many UOB cards  don’t want give me lol.  I always pay full on time also 🤣,btohqsg
Lol I only got 2. Serious?,btohqsg
😂😂😂so I suppose I got so many,btohqsg
Even u apply all.. if u eligible I tink they will issue? Cuz all share same credit limit anyway,btohqsg
Think so but end of days it's up to Bank to decide we won't know,btohqsg
Yea I just wait for their reply. Yesterday I called they say pending lol,btohqsg
Pending ok at least got hope,btohqsg
If say rejected then u know what do next,btohqsg
Probably cancel all my cards lol,btohqsg
Since they don’t valued u as customer,btohqsg
Maybe due to surge or application,btohqsg
Due to their new uob one adjustment,btohqsg
I sign the privi miles card as backup since other Miles cards got 1k limit for 4mpd,btohqsg

Signature or not. How did you pay?- Online- Paywave/Masterpass- Chip based- Swipe,btohqsg

This is considered a low-risk investment (Not capital guaranteed)https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/wisesaver/Are my capital and returns guaranteed?There is no guarantee of the capital amount. However  as the underlying instrument is a cash fund which places your money predominantly in fixed deposits of local financial institutions with a minimum short-term rating of F2 by Fitch  P-2 by Moody's  or A-2 by S&P  it is very unlikely that you will experience any capital loss.Your returns depend on the weighted average gross yield of the underlying deposits  which may fluctuate as market and economic conditions change.Your savings earn interest on a daily basis net of fees based on the current weighted average gross yield published.,btohqsg

For advise pls; currently from 2021 till date  ive been using citi cashback and maxed out the cashback everymth sincemy monthly spending is ard $800-$1.5k. Big portion of it comes from spending in malaysia via linked viaAmaze Card.My strategy for 2023 is to maximise the interest in ocbc 360 savings account. So i have to spend min $500 on ocbc 360 cc  apart from salary crediting and increase of $500 monthly average. Since ocbc 365 is visa i cant use my Amaze Card anymore so i thought of using it for Citi Rewards Card  at least i could earn miles while spending after hitting my minimum spending on my ocbc 365 (i usually spend 800-1.2k per mth)For your advise on better strategy pls. Thank you.,btohqsg
whats the best debit card / saving account for a working individual now,btohqsg
If you insist on using a debit card and can spend $500 or more a month  go for UOB One account and debit card. Alternatively if you can't hit min spend  go for SC Jumpstart account and card.,btohqsg
Or if you spend $400+ a month can also consider DBS Multiplier + DBS Visa debit card,btohqsg
Pretty good  more than 50% already above median income ($5020 monthly)! Keep the data going and poll if you haven't,btohqsg
Overall best (for now) UOB Onehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZBot2G97gI,btohqsg

Thanks! But wonder how to sign up? I didn’t receive any user ID/password,btohqsg
Applying ocbc 365 card. Any referrals? Promo?,btohqsg
Oh  i activated my digital card via the standard chartered app! But I have the jumpstart account already  so maybe it was easier for me to activate since I do not have to create a profile haha. Did the email state anything?,btohqsg
I wonder the activation is count from the day u activate the physical card or digital version?,btohqsg
I see  I never signed up for SC account before. So do not have the online account,btohqsg
You may tap on the card readers as part of NETS bah,btohqsg
Simply go only accepted visa Mastercard,btohqsg
Another option if want AmexThen use amex top up grab and use grab it for simply go,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone successfully open RHB high yield saving account ? Are you able to select account type as ‘Single’?,btohqsg
why not uob one account which likely gives better interest than ocbc360?,btohqsg
Tuas Power customers can get free stuff sia,btohqsg
Grabpay cant topup to youtrip and more?,btohqsg
Probably because of ocbc 365 didnt have cashback cap of each categories compared to uob one.,btohqsg
But upon calculation its $241 for ocbc vs $271 for uob per mth. Based on 75k savings.,btohqsg
Just realised my strategy wouldnt earn any cashback since ocbc 365 need a min spend of 800. Uob only 500,btohqsg
Uob is better if u spend Lower to meet the requirements,btohqsg
Wat kind of transactions for uob one card not eligible of the min 500,btohqsg
Yeah. Of the $500 min spending.,btohqsg
refer to the exclusion list in the TnC,btohqsg
good morning to all  assuming i can only make 1 choice.should I:1. Buy in SSB for this month.2. Buy Tbill and competitive bid3. keep the money in OCBC 360,btohqsg
Depends your OCBC 360 hit which tier though,btohqsg
If you are hitting salary + the bonus from 500 saving monthly. That is alr 3.2% which is alr more than ssb first 3 years and close to year 4,btohqsg
For a shorter term perspective (up to year 4 - assuming 360 doesn't revise down)   360 seems to be clear cut winner comparing against SSB Jan issuance.,btohqsg
What about your interest tier . Which category can you hit,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone knows whether Youtrip supports Taiwan currency and how long does it take for the card to deliver after applying? Have got a trip lined up there for next monday and would like to give it a try,btohqsg

No more 1.7% Cashback on UOB absolute next year…,btohqsg
Finally it came. Time to cancel the card,btohqsg
so only amex TCB for grab top up ?,btohqsg
From my understanding from the image  do correct me if I am wrong. Is that only grab top up will be 0.3% cashback while the other catergory is still 1.7% cashback.,btohqsg
Going to apply Amex true cashback card Liao,btohqsg
UOB Absolute AMEX will be nerfing Grabpay Wallet Top-ups on 15 Jan 2023.With effect from 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%.Discuss more on:https://t.me/honeymoneysg,btohqsg
Plus uib amex no anex pay to SGQRc,btohqsg
Bye bye UOB...Hello Amex TCB again,btohqsg
Grab card also can throw away Liao,btohqsg
Is it possible to use True AMEX via AXS to pay the Insurance?,btohqsg
Amex more for niche like pay hospital or insurance,btohqsg
Amex sometimes got good deal from amex app,btohqsg
So amex issued still got its perk over uob amexAmex issued amex support mobile payment app like apple and Samsung payAmex pay on app sGQRAmex offer on amex app,btohqsg
Now grab use for f&b for the QR got points Liao,btohqsg
Ya now constantly got point no More zero for me,btohqsg
There are alternative apps...the one I use most frequently now is LiquidPay,btohqsg
Even if amex tcb got nerf when use on top up grab due to amex pay support SGQR,btohqsg
I still earned 1.5 from SGQR,btohqsg
It still got it perks unlike uob amex once Nerf it's becomes a paper weigh,btohqsg
I rather use other cards for f&b for higher cashback,btohqsg
Hawkee u can pay wave meh haha,btohqsg
Some wet market accept sgqr too,btohqsg
Ya but I feel liquid not so stable,btohqsg
Crmc amaze can use for public transport?Dont know what I can redeem with my SC SMART card,btohqsg
Alternative is to use Amex Pay with Amex cards like TCB  KF  Platinum etc.,btohqsg
SMRT card is Citi. Or are you referring to SC Smart?,btohqsg
Ya if grab really Nerf amex TCB I will use amex pay for SGQR,btohqsg
Can redeem for cashback or miles.,btohqsg
But I move on to UOB one,btohqsg
Is there a guide to redeem for cashback? The points rewards page only shows all the airline partners for miles,btohqsg

Hi guys  whats the essential difference between OCBC titanium and other 4mpd cards since the limit is the same @ about 12k/year ?,btohqsg
OCBC Titanium Rewards has an annual limit while most other cards have a monthly limit. You also need to look at the eligible transactions for 4 mpd for OCBC Titanium vs other cards.,btohqsg
okay thank you. but isnt the limit about the same since its around 13k while others is about 1k/month (12k/year) also then would amaze tactic work for OCBC titanium rewards ?,btohqsg
But Titanium doesn't give 4 mpd for everything with Amaze. Only shopping transactions.,btohqsg
And you don't need to pair Amaze with Titanium to get the 4 mpd since the bonus rate applies for offline transactions as well. Unless you're shopping in FCY and you want to use Amaze to get the better FX rate.,btohqsg
btw any one knows which CC earn points from paying insurance and adding as recurring payment?,btohqsg
as i noticed amex some insurnace only allow for first payment and subsequent will not be allow so mostly only visa / MC,btohqsg
like AIA state first payment amex okthe following dont allow amex,btohqsg
Also  some Maybank cards allow. Such as Maybank Visa Infinite (1.2 mpd)  Maybank Horizon (0.4 mpd)  Maybank Platinum Visa (3.33%),btohqsg
i alwasy encounter issue submit myinfo to maybank always need me to maually submit,btohqsg
even manualkly submit also got issue like their system cmi,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback Card nerfs GrabPay top-upsFrom 15 January 2023  UOB Absolute Cashback Cardholders will only earn 0.3% cashback on GrabPay top-ups  instead of the current 1.7%.bit.ly/3BEfAtLDiscuss this@milelion. Join@milelionroarsfor more updates,btohqsg
top up as much as u can before it nerfed,btohqsg
Max is 10k/month to top up to grab  so Dec and Jan max is only 20k,btohqsg
Anyone know if Amaze has Apple Pay support in SG?,btohqsg
Lmao I just received this card few days ago and they decided to nerf it. If only more insurance company accepts amex then this card still serves it purpose,btohqsg
Overseas spending any recommendation for CC or amaze which linked to Citi rewards card,btohqsg
I saw online that annual fee waiver for CRMC is 'N/A'  does it mean we cant call in to waive the fee after the first year?,btohqsg

One more nail for grab coffin,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
Anyway to convert AMEX to master card?Any convertor available?,btohqsg
Gg UOB Absolute + GrabPay MasterCard combo,btohqsg
Should we top up Grab max $5k before nerf??,btohqsg
Then slowly spend the $5k over a period of time,btohqsg
At least this will buy us time to think of another strategy,btohqsg
Already ShopeePay just imposed 2% fee on all credit card/ debit card top ups  so doesn’t make sense to use UOB Absolute to top up ShopeePay le,btohqsg
You can consider to if you still use grab services. At least UOB warned the users unlike Grab that silently nerfed the e wallet top ups while o was still traveling 🥲,btohqsg
I was thinking maybe can use ShopeePay to circumvent the AMEX issue since most merchants don’t accept Amex,btohqsg
Last time still ok to use GPMC overseas coz 1.2% grab points and 1.7% UOB Absolute.Then after this nerf… no point to use GPMC overseas. RIP.Back to YouTrip…,btohqsg
My current strategy is using Revolut 1% metal cash back card ever since Grab nerf and since I travel more frequently in this period and they provide travel insurance.,btohqsg
Plus Citi + amaze on weekends,btohqsg
Now the issue I face is because I’m using UOB ONE credit card then all those spending above the $500 quota or $1k quota doesn’t add to my rebates so my backup strategy for UOB Absolute + GPMC doesn’t really make sense anymore.,btohqsg
I mean  I still use GPMC to pay for income tax  HDB conservancy fees and insurance via AXS+ GPMC but 0.3% rebate is meh.Not sure if even worth the trouble to jump thro hoops to save a few $,btohqsg
Just applied Amex TCB card hope it don’t get nerf 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Yes I need it to top up grab Mastercard for my AXS payment,btohqsg
That’s that only way to still earn cashback on Grab top ups,btohqsg
Ie to replace UOB Absolute with AMex TCB 1.5%,btohqsg
Yes the only way for now,btohqsg
Remember TCB 3% welcome gift excludes GrabPay topups,btohqsg
Amex had been the most resilient actually. I don’t see it nerfing their rebates.It’s usually the banks that carry their version of AMEX that do,btohqsg
Hopefully . If TCB also nerf there is no other way Liao,btohqsg
i keep reading TCB as Tan Cheng Bock,btohqsg
