GV motorworks paid SGCM for it ah,btohqsg
Can sgcm legally promote $0 downpayments,btohqsg
Like yes dealers put it in their listings and that's on them,btohqsg
I thought 0 dp is illegal,btohqsg
But on sgcm posts if it's highlighted  that's coming from sgcm no?,btohqsg
Yes there is a grey area to get around it and how it's done,btohqsg
But I'm pretty sure it's illegal to promote fraudulent activities,btohqsg
Im pretty sure MAS knows what is going on,btohqsg
like alot things they know is on-going  but its not strictly enforced,btohqsg
Plus MAS ruling for 30dp 70 loan applies mostly to the commercial banks no? Some of this dealers is in house loan,btohqsg
Yes of course they know sir,btohqsg
It's a bit hard not to know what's going on with anything in Singapore,btohqsg
Also it applies to any finance company  merchant bank and full bank,btohqsg
And only these and licensed moneylenders can technically give out loans,btohqsg
Think so  like promoting listing on Carousell.,btohqsg
You need to bribe them with nasi Padang first,btohqsg
Really? Maybe never enforce. FB many such ads. 0% down. 1.99% interest  phv packages etc.,btohqsg
Actually idk whats the rationale for max 70% loan,btohqsg
Was there a huge influx of bad debts caused by car loans prior to the ruling?,btohqsg
Sorry ah i was quite young back then didnt really follow the news,btohqsg
So that people do not make financially irresponsible decisions,btohqsg
Ngl.. some ppl in life deserves a lesson abt money tho.. but oh wells. At least i think its 👍,btohqsg
TDSR alot of young couples has high debt payments per mth which affect their chance to get housing loan,btohqsg
That's why I saddle myself with a housing loan before I bought my first car,btohqsg
i mean if HDB wasn't priced so high  the loan amount wont be that much..,btohqsg
Can. Got tourist there sure don’t mind trying 🤣,btohqsg
Consider very cheap already.If you see China and HK... At least over 80% own their house.If you see recent new in Australia.  There are no house available to rent.,btohqsg
Malaysian officer at JB checkpoint gets some easy money from drivers who like to take shortcutsA video uploaded on SGRV shows a 🇲🇾 traffic enforcer casually strolling along the long queue of cars at the JB checkpoint and collecting what looks like money from cars travelling on the 🏍 lane.50RM or 100RM like quite affordable to skip the queue. Like a Disneyland fast pass! - JRead the full article ⬇️➡️http://bit.ly/3RIWNV9,btohqsg
