Just use the iOS notes app,btohqsg
Because they genuinely think that paying for such an app will help their grades,btohqsg
imo a bit extra but if it suits u go for it,btohqsg
Y not type the notes instead,btohqsg
Only if you're fast in typing,btohqsg
A bit hard to type math notes also,btohqsg
Recommend a brand of external hard drive,btohqsg
Chads type maths notes in real time with latex,btohqsg
Teacher writing a triple fraction with definite intervals,btohqsg
And the Chad just nails writing the expression in latex first try,btohqsg
I should learn how to write in latex,btohqsg
If you ctrl+C enough it will be faster,btohqsg
Is 2tb thumbdrive reliable? How is it different from 2tb external hard disk,btohqsg
There's a reason why those 2tb thumbdrives you see on Wish hasn't taken over the world yet,btohqsg
Price for hard disk u mean?,btohqsg
Thumbdrive will spoil easily is it,btohqsg
im spying on sgeducators and they claim people are stealing their members and adding them to another group  ironic as they are built on stealing members themselves,btohqsg
im not even associated at all with sgexams but i find what they do inethical and distasteful as hell,btohqsg
hard disks are cheaper than thumbdrives no?,btohqsg
Let’s not give them the satisfaction of attention here,btohqsg
Yeah how do you say your name and oso how tf did they add me lmao,btohqsg
Ayy any uni students here and how to deal with burnout,btohqsg
Finals in like 4 weeks tho,btohqsg
A lot ppl burn out during jc,btohqsg
Sec 1 and 2 are Iike O Levels on slow mode,btohqsg
Some say one module in uni teaches more than whole A Levels,btohqsg
Hmm no. Harddisks more ex  lets say a 2TB harddisk is $64 but thumbdrive $10-20 only,btohqsg
considering the fact that the bridging math module is the entire h2 pure math syllabus,btohqsg
Ec1301 cover the whole of h2 econs+ more,btohqsg
sounds like a scam thumbdrive to me tbh,btohqsg
But you take less modules than A Levels subjects I presume,btohqsg
5 mods are like 5 subjects actually,btohqsg
It's still compressed to 6 months,btohqsg
Just less stress cause u can screw up,btohqsg
I took an NTU module as H3  the entire content is as much as a level biology syallbus,btohqsg
And it's just one module leh,btohqsg
I took NUS H3 introduction to modern physics,btohqsg
After A Levels  the syllabus does seem pretty small,btohqsg
It wasn't exactly a whole a levels thingy,btohqsg
But most are actually comparable to a level workload,btohqsg
I heard numerous times that they fail earlier compared to other brands,btohqsg
Depends on your level of interest I suppose,btohqsg
Eutrophication  are u scared that ur classmate will shame u or smt,btohqsg
Most of my classmates are just acquaintances,btohqsg
It’s harder to make friends as u grow old,btohqsg
tfw ive only met my juniors once,btohqsg
I’m not in touch with anybody from my upper Sec class,btohqsg
and ill probably never see them again in school :(,btohqsg
And I’m only in touch with one guy from lower sec,btohqsg
U change class from sec1-Sec 4?,btohqsg
