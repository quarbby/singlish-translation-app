Hi guys  need some advice. Whatâ€™s your take on this? Farrer Park Fields Kallang Whampoa 4-rooms  or Tengah Waterfront 5 rooms ?,btohqsg
depends on whether u like the location ?,btohqsg
Like town area more  you but consider Tengah bcus it is cheaper   got parent grants & it is 5 rooms,btohqsg
Parents grant is only for resale,btohqsg
if you have the money to afford Kallang/Whampoa then yes go for it   but if u prefer to spend lesser and go for non mature estate then Tengah it is but keep in mind itâ€™ll take a while for Tengah to be developed so thereâ€™ll still be amenities that are not available nearby the estate  and its next to PIE + nearby Tengah airbase so consider well,btohqsg

Hi guys  pretty noob to this Im currently serving NS (ORD Aug this year)My spouse is a student (Graduate May this year)If we apply for BTO I understand we need to pay 5% + other fees when selecting unit? For that portion isit possible to use the grant we get when we apply for EHG or need fork out cash to pay for the fees + 5%.,btohqsg
yo  my understanding now is you guys qualify for the deferred downpayment of 5% because not working for 1 year yet  thats correct. the bulk of other fees are stamp duty  which depends on the price of the house you're paying for. Because you guys are eligible for the deferment  you guys don't get grant. Grant is only for couples where at least 1 person has worked for a year (sorry  ns doesnt count)* So yes  whatever your cpf can't cover  cash will have to be forked out,btohqsg
Not possible as you as a couple will be considered under Deferred Income Assessment. As a result of DIA  your EHG and HLE will only be assessed about 3 months before key collection.,btohqsg
Are either one of you under 30?,btohqsg
AHHHH i seeSo when apply btoApply for deferred income assessmentFork out the 5% for downpayment plus stamp duty n other fees then 3 months before key collection get hle n ehg assessment?,btohqsg
no needa apply for deferred income assessment  it's auto!,btohqsg
they may want you to provide your 11b and ur partner's uni letter is all,btohqsg
I see okok swee! Thankyouu! Finally understand,btohqsg
Ok so you are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment. As you are under 30  you're eligible for Staggered downpayment scheme.Hence you will need to pay the following:,btohqsg
Yes hehe ok me will read,btohqsg
If cannot I will copy and paste again,btohqsg
Thankyou very much both of u ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
For mine key collection is 3rd quarter July to Sept have u received the email,btohqsg
So fast?? I c e website like not even halfway completed leh,btohqsg
If we bought a resale flat with only (proximity grant) then we sell it and buy a bto does it count as second time buyer? Is there a 1st time buyer grant?,btohqsg
Seems like you will be classified as a second timer and you will need to pay a resale levy.Since EHG is meant for first timer families or buyers you would not be classified as a first timer  hence no grant for you.Do give HDB a call to verify though. This is based on the info I got from 99co and HDB website.,btohqsg
Flowchart above for you to check,btohqsg
I've been there all the 6 blocks has been completed n painted.The multistory carparks also painted j ready.Have u been there.Even talk to the Bangla over there they also said currently touching up all the exterior jobs.U must go there n see,btohqsg
I call hdb they say estimated time of completion is 4th quarter of 2023,btohqsg
Exactly but did u received their emails,btohqsg
Maybe around 4_5 mths will be completed I guess maybe u can go there n see,btohqsg
Oh I see... this place u got is during BTO exercises or SBF,btohqsg
hi if anyone can advice  if we are first timers  combined income below $14k. if we buy resale near either parents house  we would be eligible for1. Family Grant2. Family Grant (first timer)3. EHG Family Grant4. PHGAre the grants stackable? Also  would it be all 4  or only 2-4?,btohqsg
I think you need to look specifically at each grant. Some might not apply to your situation... Do check HDB website for clarification,btohqsg
Hello  HLE is required before i go for flat booking correct? A friend of mine die2 say itâ€™s not needed you can just go ahead and book a flat without it so iâ€™m a little confused now,btohqsg
When in doubt  call up HDB,btohqsg
Itâ€™s required for HDB to assess whether youâ€™re eligible for a loan during the booking of flat  last time maybe they close eye dont have HLE still okay  now maybe not.but then again if ur HLE is still processing  you can still book a flat  HDB officer will do the HLE on the spot with you  as long as you got apply for HLE,btohqsg
hello everyone  so we applied for HLE and alr book a flat for BMR but my HLE status is still this  can someone confirm with me if i am looking at the right place?,btohqsg
