Hopefully that driver is not in this chat 😅,btohqsg
If he saw this  then he will knew I don't have video footage:/,btohqsg
Unfortunately  not yet. My workshop said will help me to continue to pursue,btohqsg
Did u try to use another laptop to check if u can read the memory card,btohqsg
Used mobile phone and laptops  both only show recording after the accident,btohqsg
I m going to change new cam,btohqsg
Is it in the next page?,btohqsg
Ie swipe the page down to see if there are more videos,btohqsg
Now is some unknown China brand. Used for 3 years already haha.y workshop recommend me to change to idrive12,btohqsg
The format is only scroll up and down. Last recording was few months back. Then it jump to after the incident time.Really appreciate u guys for giving me ideas and suggestions 🙏,btohqsg
U can see videos after the accident,btohqsg
Is it still within the carpark,btohqsg
Are u able to see other car plate number ?,btohqsg
Use motorist app and msg the car plate owners,btohqsg
Might be late due to auto delete now,btohqsg
Or you can share and we can chat with him,btohqsg
If he has that app ah,btohqsg
Or maybe can chat with the driver on the car make chats,btohqsg
Don't know if that will help,btohqsg
Ya. I will try to retrieve the video first and try to reach the surrounding cars,btohqsg
Anyone know a low cost method for  2019 GLC250 to have the carplay connection?,btohqsg
The road tax is quite cool,btohqsg
Basically an early version of the v10 that VAG proceeded to put into the Gallardo and R8,btohqsg
Technically still being used in the huracan,btohqsg
But the 5.2L FSI engine that went in once VAG took Lamborghini over,btohqsg
Lol suddenly so many pay! Pay! 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Lol I've deleted n banned them - J,btohqsg
Luckily never delete and ban me,btohqsg
Long time never hear from you,btohqsg
Yeah been working behind the scenes for the event this Saturday!,btohqsg
Will send all of the participants a reminder tmr. Don't last minute pang seh ah - J,btohqsg
WHERE’S THE FUN IF THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS TO SOLVE!!!!,btohqsg
I help you tidy up make nicer,btohqsg
bumper commit die before suffering a life of being slammed,btohqsg
The van looks like a resident there,btohqsg
Can't let these people get off easily,btohqsg
Single white continuous line in the middle of a bidirectional road  no parking at all times on either side of the road regardless of the quantity of cars one has. 😁😁😁,btohqsg
how u managed to find the van?,btohqsg
This one should be some neighbours complain  if no one complains  usually they just close one eye,btohqsg

Why are u using hp while driving? Like tt  I can’t wish u luck,btohqsg
Bvtt p0ke cannot but the other stuffs yesterday can,btohqsg
🙈🙈 if you look at the speedo,btohqsg
Oh I remember seeing this  apparently their neighborhood no broken line to park,btohqsg
Entitled man. 3 to 5 cars? Then buy bigger house. House no space to park buy so many car for what,btohqsg
Is this only for exclusive passes that can go ?,btohqsg
I did register in the link before the cut off date,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately due to space constraints we cannot let everyone go - J,btohqsg
But if this event does well  WE WILL PLAN MORE!!! - J,btohqsg
This is not the answer lol.,btohqsg
Turn PHV COE to be separate  problem somewhat solved 🤣,btohqsg
Cogent argument for a more equitable COE system but it goes against the grain of a free market system which our government is all about,btohqsg
Quota for both would shrink but pricing might be more stable and split in that case,btohqsg
That’s pushing the problem somewhere else sir,btohqsg
But not much difference because at the end  number of cars (total quota) remains the same,btohqsg
Sounds like a someone else problem.,btohqsg
if free market  why got 3/4 rule?,btohqsg
Well  does the rule “own self check own self” apply?,btohqsg
what they should do is to stop excessive car buying within households.. see the sembawang one  3 to 5 cars..,btohqsg
actually those household with 2nd car onwards  very simple  let them bid for COE  give way to those household without car first.. then 2nd car coe start from 100k LOL. quite easy then alr,btohqsg
For one thing  I feel that the 10 year COE period should be reviewed,btohqsg
But how do you justify this?,btohqsg
This wouldn’t fly very well with the top 10% 🤣,btohqsg
they have been promoting carlite. plus increase revenue anyways.,btohqsg
What if I split my vehicles as business registered assets over multiple companies,btohqsg
But you cannot deny  cars are necessary.,btohqsg
GST hike doesnt fly with everyone but it is necessary,btohqsg
How do you define household and maintain it?,btohqsg
COE exists for good reason  the aim of the government was never to make cars accessible for the masses,btohqsg
For them they have good public transport available,btohqsg
So I invest in houses  1 family member 1 house  still can live under 1 roof,btohqsg
Who pay lots of taxes!!!! Woohooo country happy.,btohqsg
And now the abundance of car sharing companies that are hiking up COE further,btohqsg
What do you mean normal bid?,btohqsg
No animosity  or hate  or any intention to offend…but really the reason why COE is probably insane now is because people are part of the#FullLoanSquad,btohqsg
i mean  if u got so much money  suree pay more ABSD just to get one car,btohqsg
SOME People will exploit this. buy cheap then faster sell for profit. And repeat WOOOHOOOOO!!!!,btohqsg
This and abundance of PHVs and car sharing,btohqsg
like currently what they have. but the 2nd coe onwards ur min bid 100k lo. aiya  its all tweaks and suggestions at the end of the day.,btohqsg
The ones with 1 house and 3-5 cars also rich what.,btohqsg
Absd on a car  mate are you seeing where you're going with this?,btohqsg
COE so crazy people buy car  still rich.,btohqsg
im referring to ABSD on house.,btohqsg
Half of the cars on the road are for PHVs  at least in my area LOL,btohqsg
Pls don’t ban FULLLOANSQUAD!!!! Then we will go out of business and we will see less GTR and Out of Reach CARS AROUND!!!,btohqsg
A car in Singapore is already inaccessible.,btohqsg
Where it suddenly becomes possible is the gig economy and stupid financing schemes that puts people in bad debt.,btohqsg
It'll just make life harder for the bottom end of the buyers,btohqsg
Then pushing more of them to use grab  car sharing  etc.,btohqsg
And that just brings COE up again,btohqsg
Think also the ones who NEED a car. A disabled family member  or elderly  or dogs…okay the last one cannot lah but needs.,btohqsg
Until everything is car sharing  leasing and PHV,btohqsg
Imagine having 6 meetings across the island and have to take MRT everywhere..,btohqsg
The COE is already a barrier  but if there’s a need  you’d only make those who need it suffer.,btohqsg
I clap for whoever can do this. But cannot be like Bugis <> City Hall hor.,btohqsg
It's all about what you can afford and what you think is necessary,btohqsg
6 meetings in a day? On the MRT  tight man...,btohqsg
WHO HAS SO MANY MEETINGS IN A DAY!,btohqsg
9am 11 am 1pm 3pm 5pm 7pm?,btohqsg
If you're in business meetings 6 times a day,btohqsg
No one wants to meet with me 🥹,btohqsg
Probably can afford a car if you make sound financial decisions,btohqsg
I don’t have lunch budget from company.,btohqsg
Which by the way… ROCKS for convenient food!,btohqsg
My boss not in this group chat sir,btohqsg
I wonder how people in really big cities like New York  Tokyo etc commute. It’s ridiculously expensive to park there even though cars are so much cheaper,btohqsg
No one in their right mind drives to work if their office is in Manhattan,btohqsg
But you wouldn’t drive  traffic is insane,btohqsg
It’s legit a dog’s breakfast at rush hour.,btohqsg
You take a town car and do meetings and calls in the back,btohqsg
I got out of the car once in NYC  walked to the office,btohqsg
Or you take the subway to be quick,btohqsg
With COE in place we aren't,btohqsg
Chicago already doesn’t put you in jail for murder…this will make NYC implement the same..,btohqsg
First time I take plane is to come Singapore work,btohqsg
Sometimes we’re there. At Ngee Ann City 😂,btohqsg
No one give way = gridlock = funtimes..,btohqsg
The beauty of COE is that it limits the total cars on the roads  and you see even with COE we have so many jams and congestions,btohqsg
Ngee Ann city is a pain during peak hours,btohqsg
Honestly  some of these are cause of the drivers...,btohqsg
That’s why  park at Hilton 😂,btohqsg
NGEE ANN CITY is for rich people,btohqsg
I just nearly got side swiped by a BMW today,btohqsg
Maybe scrap COE with a pay as you drive kind of system? I don’t know,btohqsg
Cause that YP don’t know what signals are and don’t have awareness.,btohqsg
Nope. But doesn’t know what mirrors are,btohqsg
It’s coming. Flexible Road Tax System!,btohqsg
Why make the aunty who drives the car to buy weekly groceries pay more?,btohqsg
Yes it is coming and I’m retiring north of our border where life is slower and a lot less expensive,btohqsg
Drive swift for 14 years only 40k mileage,btohqsg
He has to send his daughter to school mah,btohqsg
this convo is too complex for me to join in,btohqsg
WHICH I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY. Her school is less than 2 minutes away!!!!,btohqsg
no stats no evidence  no solution.,btohqsg
also its more of a singaporean mentality problem which cannot be solved by raising prices LOL,btohqsg
9 times out of 10  a jam is caused by a fucktard on the expressway,btohqsg
Very good morning to you guys too,btohqsg
cruising happily on the right lane at 70kmh,btohqsg
u know whats worse  all 4 lanes cruising at 70 with a heavy vehicle on lane 2,btohqsg
There was a taxi that merged into an expressway at 40kph,btohqsg
Sit in the car  jamming to songs,btohqsg
And then maintained that but the lane was empty..,btohqsg
also the government is perfectly happy with the way coe is going  perfect for budget balance.,btohqsg
DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT  EVERYBODY FEELING WARM AND RIGHT,btohqsg
If it’s cruising constant that’s fine. it’s when a cvnt comes in to the right lane at 50kph and cause a chain reaction to cause a massive jam,btohqsg
they want a car lite society u think they will make owning a car cheaper?😂😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Fucktards every where but we have the most here,btohqsg
Let me bring my dog on the bus damn it,btohqsg
drivers license take 6+ months to get but some still cant drive properly😂😂,btohqsg
ppl in the us drive better,btohqsg
been there  they drive like morons,btohqsg
Wah@tomhasajyou clearly have never met a Karen on the road..,btohqsg
Need to practise driving ard geylang and little india more,btohqsg
People in Msia drive better- a lot more,btohqsg
Sure will be expert in driving,btohqsg
Please just Little India during Deepavali,btohqsg
Then one understands the true meaning of JAMS. Singapore is nothing!!!!,btohqsg
Jinx. You owe me a coke.,btohqsg
Still not bad. Have you seen the web of jaywalkers in little India?,btohqsg
I see where this is going,btohqsg
Last time I stay near there,btohqsg
The usual slowing down to pass at an accidents  just to gawk,btohqsg
I mean  I wouldn’t go BRAAAPBRAAAPBRAAAAAP POP! pass the TP at the accident now would I?,btohqsg
But really… new drivers need to go to little india and geylang to practise,btohqsg
But agree  the amount of long necks..,btohqsg
Also  sometimes i do believe coe prices are increasing due to inflation. while its self stabilizing  it should always be going up up up,btohqsg
The other day I was merging into an expressway and a car in lane 3 on the expressway flashed me multiple times as I stopped to give way but he stopped to give me way....,btohqsg
But please inform us the dates that they will be there,btohqsg
The guy in lane 3 that is,btohqsg
10 years ago and now  COE makes up roughly half the price of a c-class  seems fair to me,btohqsg
The traffic light should say: P Plates on road,btohqsg
You really haven't seen how people drive around the world,btohqsg
Every country has its own issues with drivers,btohqsg
Not everyone has travelled the world like you,btohqsg
Need to drive into the small roads,btohqsg
The best drivers are in Scandinavia though,btohqsg
The aussies are really nice though,btohqsg
these guys are a different breed,btohqsg
they apologise when you are in the wrong,btohqsg
Do this and I will respect you,btohqsg
maybe cos they all drive BOLBO,btohqsg
Agree. I worked in Oslo for about 6 years. Scandinavians are safe and patient drivers,btohqsg
All the bluesg Shd go there,btohqsg
They’re apologising because the doctor must’ve dropped you when you were born. Not because of anything else.,btohqsg
The Scandis are the most sarcastic funny people I know.,btohqsg
slightly different issue. Singapore has good road planning  jakarta doesnt.,btohqsg
You want a mass murder even in SG is it?,btohqsg
I’m training them up to be careful drivers,btohqsg
There was a truck behind him lol,btohqsg
Hey guys let’s not blame the car,btohqsg
It’s the driver not the car,btohqsg
There’s no “worst car” per se,btohqsg
I’m not blaming the car… I’m blaming the car rental company,btohqsg
the old pininfarina car was dog shit,btohqsg
I respect you already  you drive in Jakarta before,btohqsg
But the cars are no better,btohqsg
Worst car is the car that is forever in workshop,btohqsg
Jakarta is best. 3 lane can magically become 5 lane one,btohqsg
Mine just came out from workshop yesterday ;(,btohqsg
worst ive experienced is bkk haha,btohqsg
Just like causeway and 2nd link,btohqsg
from svb to the main city…,btohqsg
I hate those that speed out from behind at the merging lanes,btohqsg
If the car is not being driven  it's worthless,btohqsg
Might as well buy a piece of art to hang at home,btohqsg
Classic cars are displayed like pieces of art what,btohqsg
And they are driven so little they hardly break down,btohqsg
How is it compare to Singaporean,btohqsg
I sat in one before… no seat belt!!!!,btohqsg
You apologise you immediately in the wrong,btohqsg
Apologising is for noobs in Singapore,btohqsg

Im actually curious if maseratis especially the gran turismo   if they are problematic to own,btohqsg
It's a V6  it's a COE car  it makes a lot of noise but has no power  and it's an Italian car  can make an educated guess on the reliability,btohqsg
Find a workshop with a cozy waiting room,btohqsg
Will spend a good amount of time there,btohqsg
BMW also uses ZF  that's the only problem free part of the car,btohqsg
But all cars come with their problems  if prepared to pay for all the maintenance then of course go ahead,btohqsg
better cars to spend your money on,btohqsg
I geuss this is more reliable too haha,btohqsg
just dont get maseratis in general,btohqsg
They're not too bad for modern ones. Gran Turismos however have their fair share of issues. The biggest problem you'll face is labour costs and parts availability as it takes time to get parts and change them,btohqsg
They're no Audi/Mercedes/BMW in terms of reliability,btohqsg
fair share = alot  arnav is being nice,btohqsg
trust based on personal experience  it isnt very fun to have to send the car back to workshop often,btohqsg
An older swift or fit sure,btohqsg
MBM lol  but it comes with a big bill too,btohqsg
only time it is fast  is back to the workshop,btohqsg
Want a Maserati? Get an MC20,btohqsg

i believe the car has aged pretty well  some of them are 8-9 years old already but still look pretty good,btohqsg
no la go for V6 or V8,btohqsg
V6 is easily one of the best sounding of recent years,btohqsg
V6 is the most common one in Singapore too,btohqsg
Current gen we haven't got the V6 or V8,btohqsg
Only the 2.0 4 cyl sadly,btohqsg
If you have the dough might as well get a Porsche  at least parts are cheaper,btohqsg
