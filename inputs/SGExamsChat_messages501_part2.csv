Honestly  unless you got family...its really unthinkable to travel,btohqsg
like I said ppl got various reasons why they wld like to leave sg,btohqsg
bruh i read about the south korean mayor that got kidnapped,btohqsg
yea i understand that point  just found it a intresting topic,btohqsg
if uw peace   js move to a countryside area,btohqsg
i can nvr understand why ppl beat the police,btohqsg
who r just doing their jobs,btohqsg
they are dissatisfied with the govt,btohqsg
tbh   the French govt is no saint. many ppl hate Macron,btohqsg
since he wna stay in power for the second term   ig this is what he gets indirectly & he gotta gave it,btohqsg
but the police cant do anything abt the govt what,btohqsg
I mean they are deployed to manage the protests,btohqsg
so since they can’t show the anger on Macron   they do it on the police,btohqsg
let me tell u   this protest have smth to do with Covid as well,btohqsg
it isn’t as simple as u think as it is,btohqsg
citizens pay taxes to the govt,btohqsg
only for the citizens to end up whacking the police,btohqsg
Macron was one of those who implemented the no jab no job those sort of policies that made him unpopular,btohqsg
coupled   with the pension issues   the citizens rly had enough so now the protest have seem to be exploded,btohqsg
Imagine studying law...and this is the bs you come up with,btohqsg
I’m gna be v frank with u. js luckily that sg govt is ruling sg. If they happen to be ruling France with that sort of policies   it will be as violent as this one   mark my words,btohqsg
the French knows what they want,btohqsg
sg sort of policies will be considered unacceptable to them too,btohqsg
the bar that served drinks to a drivers that later on to drive and kill was ordered to pay 301 billion to the family of the killed,btohqsg
Imagine getting 23 billion for sueing a tobacco making company,btohqsg
for killing your spouse who smoked their products,btohqsg
that is honestly bs tho. this rule,btohqsg
it means no matter how bad they do   u have to stay quiet until the protest is approved,btohqsg
it means u allow them to control u,btohqsg
in america you can always sue the source,btohqsg
but likely the 301 billion wont be paid,btohqsg
u allow them to do whatever shit they want,btohqsg
that ‘s what they are doing now,btohqsg
doing some of the shits & yet u can’t rly voice it out,btohqsg
they feel more like u are against them,btohqsg
rather than the idea of feedback,btohqsg
In America  if you get into a accident with a big company...irregardless of who is at fault  you can sue the big company and get a huge payout,btohqsg
having such a law is ok but it is not ok when u have those who feel that u are opposing them instead,btohqsg
i rmb watching that one vid on lky,btohqsg
where he was being interviewed by the bbc,btohqsg
they are paid fat salaries lol,btohqsg
they shld start taking a pay cut alr,btohqsg
that last portion is legit what ive been saying,btohqsg
is extremely overpriced to adopt them in the first place,btohqsg
Like all those ppl complaining...how bout you work hard and stand the chance to become a minister,btohqsg
i just dont know how america can function when these are the kind of bs laws they need to handle,btohqsg
like how much money can they give,btohqsg
this is legit greedy taking over the greedy,btohqsg
but some of the current ones  are they rly that gd,btohqsg
is not as easy as it sounds,btohqsg
