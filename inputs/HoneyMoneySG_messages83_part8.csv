I applied for OCBC 365 credit card via singsaver in Oct 2023 for the $320 cash  and met the requirements of min $500 spent within 30 days of card approval. However  when I checked my dashboard today  it said no record found. Jialat,btohqsg
New to UOB Evol  may I know when will the credit be given? Mid or end month for previous month's spending?,btohqsg
it says the feature is for CIMB cc applications only?,btohqsg
Oh I see. So still got hope I guess. I've submitted a request for them to check already.,btohqsg
not entirely sure tho  maybe someone else more experienced with singsaver can shed some light,btohqsg
Hi  can I know is the CIMB promo end of Jan or now have to empty and transfer fund to other places?,btohqsg
I just ended the 30days (less than 50k). Can i top up to 50k to continue another 30 days?,btohqsg
My understanding is 1 participation per campaign  but you may check with CSO to confirm,btohqsg
Hi all  for OCBC student loan  is there anyway to get credit card rewards for repayment? From what I know itâ€™s only payment by cash or cheque  is that true?,btohqsg
I would empty on 31 Jan but keep $1k for the last interest on 20 Feb before zero out,btohqsg
Hi there. Iâ€™m wondering about the cardup platform. I saw the video covering about this in YouTube. I wonder whatâ€™s the best card to use so far haha. I have like 20k points under Cathay Pacific and wonder if I should change to KrisFlyer or just remain in Asia miles. So far I plan to pay my insurance (lump sum once a year)  mortgage  and tax.,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve got a Citi PremierMiles visa so far and wonder if the UOB KrisFlyer Mastercard a good idea to apply and pass the transaction there.,btohqsg
I also would like to ask if I were to use the hsbc giro to get the bonus 1% cashback to the card. Would using the Citi be enough or it would be better to just get a UOB card. I also plan to get a car loan down the road.,btohqsg
Hi any good way to pay rd tax and earn miles?,btohqsg
May I know why only keep 1k for 20 Feb interest? Why don't empty it before 20th Feb?,btohqsg
20th Feb still got last bit of interest  just trying to play it safe,btohqsg
Ok. So just empty and leave 1000sgd on 31th Jan. Thanks for sharing,btohqsg
From my understanding. 6 months after your account opening.,btohqsg
Base on my understanding  So after 6 months. If you want to maintain then keep 1k inside your account. Or you may close the account with no fee.,btohqsg
Your TNC is new account   mine is existing account :),btohqsg
Yes.My overseas spends so far all included  just make sure itâ€™s not the typical excluded transactions like wallet topup etc.,btohqsg
Unlikelyâ€¦ the interest rates have been consistent throughout the year whether Feds increase or decrease.UOB One has been the same before all the digital banks (ie. Trust Bank and Maribank) start popping up.,btohqsg
Anyone got suggestions where to place warchest money while we wait for appropriate time to buy into stocks?? Managed to accumulate 50k sitting in bank earning miserable interest.,btohqsg
check out either Esaver or CIMB for fuss free 3.x%,btohqsg
Time in the market beats timing the market,btohqsg
this may no longer hold true in the current volatile market.good to get out when timing is right and then park the proceeds in risk free bank savings accounts earning 4%.,btohqsg
Thanks for the immensely valuable advice. I will take note of it.,btohqsg
Timing the market was how many ppl went to risk free last year  and missed the 20% market return.,btohqsg
Oh read wrongly. End of the next statement month.,btohqsg

If I spend 1K+ on a single online transaction with HSBC revolution would I still get 4000 miles (1mpd till 1K)?,btohqsg
