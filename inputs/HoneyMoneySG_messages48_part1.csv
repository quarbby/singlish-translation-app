some people ask me why it's not recommended to exceed 100k in OCBC360. here's why.for OCBC360  if you meet salary  spend and save criteria $100k - you get $394.9 interest a month (4.73%)$199k - you get $399.11 interest a month$200k - you get $602.98 a month (2.39%)so not worth to exceed 100k.,btohqsg
But I haven't use CardUp before  so after the new promo and tying with UOB Prvi  it's costing me 1.1cpmNot too bad ?,btohqsg

Hi  I am new to HSBC EGA. The new promotion mentioned bonus interest is on June and July  but fulfilment is on 30 Sept. My question is  will I get penalised and not paid any interests if I withdraw the full amount from HSBC on 1 Aug?,btohqsg
HSBC ega 2 month only.. anyway still ok if just switch fund around. First month with everyday+ got extra 1%. So net net two month can hit avg 4.35% (4.85+3.85),btohqsg
I think as long as u dun close acct. will get. But u might need to pay fall below fee.,btohqsg
So can switch money out from HSBC in Aug and still be paid the bonus interest? Anyone has already received the bonus interest can verify this?,btohqsg
Many here switch fund around and did not close acct. switch back after reset,btohqsg
My ega just got approved today! Likely in Aug will switch out to any bank that pay good interests,btohqsg
Because there is this caluse Eligible Customer must remain at respective Customer Segment to receive the respective Bonus Interest. I don't really understand this,btohqsg
SCB Seaver promo updated for jun. Only 3.4% ü§£,btohqsg
I think refer to premier acct. must stay at premier tier,btohqsg

Yeah so just toggle around with HSBC and SCB while main stays with UOB,btohqsg

Anyone who uses HSBC revo here  could you share how much points you used for an airplane ticket?Just wondering like how many points is needed to maybe go to Bangkok?  Thank you :),btohqsg
Conversation is 2.5 points to a mile.25k points to 10k miles,btohqsg
Base on SIA redemption chart  SIN-BKK economy saver return ticket requires 13500 miles x 2 = 27 000 miles excluding tax n service charge. This equal to 67 500 HSBC reward points. You need to pay about S$40 of conversion fee.https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQ_AwdChart.pdf,btohqsg
Okay got it  thank you!! I understand that I‚Äôve to fill up a form to sign for the miles programme,btohqsg

Whats difference in interest between one who salary credit $2k and one who $8k,btohqsg
So if salary credit 2k  so can withdraw max 1.5k only?,btohqsg
Youtrip announced free ATM withdrawal is coming on their Instagram,btohqsg
no  unless your salary credit is on the first of the month which is unlikely. also depends on whether you have any other withdrawals in the month. you need to make sure the daily average for the month increase by 500. best is to use Excel to compute.,btohqsg
hi just wanna ask  I just stacked my Citi Rewards with an Amazed card & understand that I can get the points on the eligible merchant's spend. But on top of that  can I still stack with Shopback or Favepay account to get their Shopback/ Favepay promos? Meanning Citi Rewards + Instarem + Shopback/Favepay = to get all the rewards from each platforms?,btohqsg
