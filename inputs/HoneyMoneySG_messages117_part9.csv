Hello guys  any good reccomendation of credit card with good gift for payment of 1k and above?,btohqsg
Many actually. Browse singsaver and see which one you don't have.,btohqsg
Late may most likely only ready for Jul's statement  provided the statement generated is generated on the last day.HSBC will send an SMS when the GIRO arrangement is made but it does not mean deductions will be started then.,btohqsg
Only via HSBC Online Chat.Use 'Credit Card Standing Instructions' to setup GIRO to pay your HSBC CC with HSBC account (no cashback).For GIRO arrangements  use 'Chat with Agent' to chat with CSO. It may take you about half an hour to an hour and a couple of CSOs to find out your GIRO arrangements for your HSBC accounts.,btohqsg

Hi gurus Assuming I am using 25years HDB loan  is it a wiser choice to pump in some cash upfront to lower to loan amt so that the monthly mortage is lower? Or just leave it and  use cpfThe thing is if leave it  the loan amt will require me to pay a few hundred each month on top of the cpf deduction,btohqsg
1) If i am keen to slowly (dca) buy into etf reit  which broker is the best to use/hold2) shld i invest in CLR or syfe reit+,btohqsg
if you dont pay cash upfront  what do you intend to do with it?,btohqsg
With risk free rates higher than hdb loan  it's a no brainier to just keep the hdb loan as it is and to slowly pay back. Furthermore if you are willing to take some risk  you can potentially get much higher returns with your spare cash which you are contamplating to lower your loan quantum.,btohqsg
Worth it to put 125k in uob account? Or just 100k is ok?,btohqsg
Assuming uob one acct  can put as close to 150k as possible. Interest rate between 100k and 125k is 4.5% pa. If your other investments have lower yield than that  better put in uob one.,btohqsg
Definitely find ways to invest and like what Dy mentioned  find those risk free investment,btohqsg
As of now I haven‚Äôt done much research on those risk free investments but definitely not going to leave it idle. Just not sure if it‚Äôs wise to pay some cash upfront to lower the mortgage,btohqsg
But thank you for the confirmation. Any recommendations on risk free investment to recommend me to read further?,btohqsg
once you pay off  you cannot cash out anymore. so try to do research to get better returns and if you are ok with the risk/reward then go ahead. you maintain dome degree of liquidity compared to paying off,btohqsg
Can watch this video and read the comments  then make your own decisionhttps://youtu.be/o6ysdb_LGeU?si=kEkg_1PUsxZn3C1J,btohqsg
Have watched your video already! Just wanna hear out some guru‚Äôs opinion üòÖ,btohqsg
Wow okay! Definitely some quality advice here. Liquidity,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth since the yield out there is definitely more than your hdb loan interest amount.Relatively low risk investment with certain degree of liquidity  you can look into money market funds or even syfe guaranteed. Even bank interest rate are generally higher interest,btohqsg
