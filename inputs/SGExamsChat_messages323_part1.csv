The bird shit on my withdrawal form,btohqsg
Poly in general harder to get in uni bc you need q a high GPA while for As you j need to be an avg As student,btohqsg
Im not kidding though. If you can thrive in MI  your view of the world and people around you is 10x more mature than people your age.,btohqsg
No I just needed it in my file,btohqsg
But the keyword is thrive. Not survive.,btohqsg
3 weeks into jc and I alr hate gp,btohqsg
You have a different experience than them,btohqsg
I can give you some tip for H1 math.And it is really practice.In O level math  they can test critial thinking  new syllabus stated 45% i believe on critical thinking.But in H1 math every year is kind of repeated in a way.,btohqsg
Wait till y2/y3 and then ull feel his pain,btohqsg
CCE is best. I love learning abt growth mindset,btohqsg
Lmao are u sure Singapore emphasises on critical thinking,btohqsg
Can Moe honestly jz rmve cce n assembly,btohqsg
And the concept is alot of smaller for H1 math,btohqsg
For H1 math you learn like 30% of A math topics which is on pure math.,btohqsg
Then statistics is also quite standard.,btohqsg
You can talk to MIâ€™s education and career counsellors. Youre not the first student facing such dilemma and u wont be the last. They got quite a bit of experience in this.,btohqsg
and i'm on mc till... guess what... tmr.,btohqsg
You can apply for poly. If you get accepted  you can still reject it.,btohqsg
At the end of the day. Once you have your poly offer  you need to pick. You can always reject the offer you got. No one is asking you to apply tmr then withdraw from MI the next day.,btohqsg
In case you dont even get your poly offer.,btohqsg
So not sure why r u conflicted. You can still apply for the poly course. Go and talk to the ECG counsellor. If you change your mind  withdraw the application or reject it. If it doesnt  then#byeMI,btohqsg
Tbf every route you go  there cfm be up and down. It the matter of you going strong.,btohqsg
I alr why drop out soon,btohqsg
if i byemi go have fun being lit rep,btohqsg
It literally says on the form,btohqsg
WLAAO@rumchelU DROPPING OUT OF YDS ?,btohqsg

E is a luxury most cant afford,btohqsg
6/10 for part A   6/15 for part 2,btohqsg
I took h1 these numbers dont make sense to me,btohqsg
"i got a U then one of the times i got E they pushed me to band 5 and then the sch became dumb agn n pushed us back to ""overall band"" aka i got pushed back to band 8",btohqsg
