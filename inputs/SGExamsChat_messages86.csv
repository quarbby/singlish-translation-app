This is like some brainwashing gif,btohqsg
my mouth shouldn‚Äôt be burning while im eating,btohqsg
i have been converted to anglo,btohqsg
seriously watching downton abbey has made me feel very british,btohqsg
You need a heavy dose of channel 8 dramas,btohqsg
Welp to me it‚Äôs just spicy and not delicious at least mcspicy has the delicious part to it,btohqsg
I think u are meant to be British,btohqsg
But it has so much flavour,btohqsg
i have yet the conquer the legendary ‚ÄúÁà±‚Äù,btohqsg
more episodes than there are grains of sand,btohqsg
Gosh I have lesson now and I totally forgot,btohqsg
I didn't even know it's Friday today,btohqsg
Which is more worth (for tutors / self employed) - to specialize in a few subjects or diversify and cover a wider base?,btohqsg
Every Friday have lesson until 7.30pm actuallt,btohqsg
But if u're so good at one topic like can teach uni kind  than teach one student is like the same as 3-4student (in terms of money(,btohqsg
But u shld hear from experienced tutor haha  I do some tutoring to help my friends but no money one,btohqsg
A few (older) experienced ones say specialize,btohqsg
~2 say diversify hahaah my dad one of them,btohqsg
For me i prefer to specialise in 1 subject,btohqsg
But at sec sch level is possible to diversify to 2-3 subjectsJc level just 1 subject will do.,btohqsg
Unless you take lots of students for the same subject,btohqsg
Yup i used to only teach maths but once inawhile i feel so sick of it,btohqsg
üîä This 4-legged robot has been deployed at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to remind visitors to observe safe distancing measures.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/2YLGflQ,btohqsg
The robot actually looks scary üòÇ,btohqsg
It looks like a video game enemy,btohqsg
Looks like the black mirror one,btohqsg
boston dynamics really do be pioneering mechatronics,btohqsg
literally thr worst possible use of these robots,btohqsg
Could have been used to deliver my food,btohqsg

We are in a different timezone,btohqsg
We haven‚Äôt hit sleep time yet,btohqsg
We went from 9AM to 8PM,btohqsg
Actually  in Singapore  people study 24/7,btohqsg
In South Korea  people study 24/7 so they don‚Äôt sleep. But sleeping is important on studying.,btohqsg
If you have any math questions during midnight there's only 1 dude that can help you,btohqsg
I haven't linked discordians to telegramers yet,btohqsg

My grandparents treat me like Korea. I study 24/7,btohqsg

I'm joking about Singaporeans studying 24/7 btw,btohqsg
But it's a pretty competitive society,btohqsg
yea i heard about the horror stories in korea,btohqsg
south korean students are big muggers,btohqsg
all the kpop idols are straight As students,btohqsg

Eventually the hair will be past yotr eyes,btohqsg
ppl who live there are blessed,btohqsg
now he take one bus to rjc,btohqsg
But at least it's just one stop,btohqsg
And all will alight at bishan,btohqsg

But I have nothing in mind hahaha,btohqsg
No need haha I got valid reason,btohqsg
Taking pw to a new level,btohqsg
Eutrophication  hit me up if u got any invention,btohqsg
The best notes app is in your brain,btohqsg
If you have one  that is,btohqsg
Just use the iOS notes app,btohqsg
Because they genuinely think that paying for such an app will help their grades,btohqsg
imo a bit extra but if it suits u go for it,btohqsg
Y not type the notes instead,btohqsg
Only if you're fast in typing,btohqsg
A bit hard to type math notes also,btohqsg
Recommend a brand of external hard drive,btohqsg
Chads type maths notes in real time with latex,btohqsg
Teacher writing a triple fraction with definite intervals,btohqsg
And the Chad just nails writing the expression in latex first try,btohqsg
I should learn how to write in latex,btohqsg
If you ctrl+C enough it will be faster,btohqsg
Is 2tb thumbdrive reliable? How is it different from 2tb external hard disk,btohqsg
There's a reason why those 2tb thumbdrives you see on Wish hasn't taken over the world yet,btohqsg
Price for hard disk u mean?,btohqsg
Thumbdrive will spoil easily is it,btohqsg
im spying on sgeducators and they claim people are stealing their members and adding them to another group  ironic as they are built on stealing members themselves,btohqsg
im not even associated at all with sgexams but i find what they do inethical and distasteful as hell,btohqsg
hard disks are cheaper than thumbdrives no?,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs not give them the satisfaction of attention here,btohqsg
Yeah how do you say your name and oso how tf did they add me lmao,btohqsg
Ayy any uni students here and how to deal with burnout,btohqsg
Finals in like 4 weeks tho,btohqsg
A lot ppl burn out during jc,btohqsg
Sec 1 and 2 are Iike O Levels on slow mode,btohqsg
Some say one module in uni teaches more than whole A Levels,btohqsg
Hmm no. Harddisks more ex  lets say a 2TB harddisk is $64 but thumbdrive $10-20 only,btohqsg
considering the fact that the bridging math module is the entire h2 pure math syllabus,btohqsg
Ec1301 cover the whole of h2 econs+ more,btohqsg
sounds like a scam thumbdrive to me tbh,btohqsg
But you take less modules than A Levels subjects I presume,btohqsg
5 mods are like 5 subjects actually,btohqsg
It's still compressed to 6 months,btohqsg
Just less stress cause u can screw up,btohqsg
I took an NTU module as H3  the entire content is as much as a level biology syallbus,btohqsg
And it's just one module leh,btohqsg
I took NUS H3 introduction to modern physics,btohqsg
After A Levels  the syllabus does seem pretty small,btohqsg
It wasn't exactly a whole a levels thingy,btohqsg
But most are actually comparable to a level workload,btohqsg
I heard numerous times that they fail earlier compared to other brands,btohqsg
Depends on your level of interest I suppose,btohqsg
Eutrophication  are u scared that ur classmate will shame u or smt,btohqsg
Most of my classmates are just acquaintances,btohqsg
It‚Äôs harder to make friends as u grow old,btohqsg
tfw ive only met my juniors once,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not in touch with anybody from my upper Sec class,btohqsg
and ill probably never see them again in school :(,btohqsg
And I‚Äôm only in touch with one guy from lower sec,btohqsg
U change class from sec1-Sec 4?,btohqsg
Mine is sec 1-2 same class  sec 3-4 streaming than new class,btohqsg
Mine got like 40 a class sia,btohqsg
This is why we need more teachers,btohqsg
Imagine if the entire tuition industry became teachers,btohqsg
I saw a advertisement about GP tuition,btohqsg
Lol then they'll need to close some CCAs,btohqsg
And u get a seat to listen to a guy talk,btohqsg
The less popular ones will die,btohqsg
Oh fuck ease don't tell me it is,btohqsg
If there's 100people listening to the guy talking,btohqsg
From Chinese orchestra become Chinese ensemble,btohqsg
Lol I thought my band in sec school was gonna die,btohqsg
The batch after me had like 15 ppl only,btohqsg
Then new asst conductor made some changes,btohqsg
I'm 2018  no sec 1 join the CCA lnao,btohqsg
Then in that one batch we had like 30+,btohqsg
What would you need a 2TB hard disk for?,btohqsg
That's like a boy band plus a girl band üòÇ,btohqsg
My school supposed to have a lot of members one,btohqsg
My drama club has like 10 new kids every year,btohqsg
I think at one point we hit 100,btohqsg
What group does band fall into wtf,btohqsg
But all dem hawt gals in there tho,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why dance should be abolished  so that they will be spread out across CCAs,btohqsg
@chemcercan u make some fun vote,btohqsg
Oh noes I feel excluded :(,btohqsg
I was just testing it out,btohqsg

That‚Äôs like in primary school when your friends ask you who u like,btohqsg
Guys? Wah eh mai lah mai lah,btohqsg

I thought the word is crush,btohqsg
You gotta have huge confidence for that,btohqsg
I too have a lot of confidence,btohqsg
I'm confident no one likes me,btohqsg
