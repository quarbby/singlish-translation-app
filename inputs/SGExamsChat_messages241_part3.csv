My teacher said they useless or something,btohqsg
My Cher say Tys very useful,btohqsg
Well I'm q bad at ss so I cant judge,btohqsg
There arenâ€™t sufficient papers in the TYS,btohqsg
only like 4 of the papers are relevant,btohqsg
The rest belong to the old syllabus,btohqsg
The ones that look like history,btohqsg
Yea I think that was what my teacher said as well. Honestly ss just need to strategise well,btohqsg
Tys is good only if u just wanna brush up on the topics that your weak in,btohqsg
But for ss a bit redundant,btohqsg
Ss u just nid understand can alr,btohqsg
The formats helps to understand better,btohqsg
Like allow u to know better what u writing,btohqsg
Uhh for SS just ask your teacher for other schoolsâ€™ papers,btohqsg
Submit them to the teacher to mark,btohqsg
MY CHER DUN WAN GIVE ME ALR,btohqsg
Still q early I think ur teacher will give u more later on,btohqsg
don't overload yourself with so much first.. make sure u fully understand the current papers u have.if alr fully understand can get full marks alr  try to get from seniors hahaha,btohqsg

Provided u dont get burnt out,btohqsg

I see so many people who worked so hard crash and burn at Os haha,btohqsg
a lot of things that I donâ€™t think I will ever seen them again,btohqsg
i think impt to not force yourself la. if u dun feel like doing but still force yourself  you're not going to actually learn anything,btohqsg
when i dun feel like doing i just slack and play games for awhile,btohqsg
Honestly no need focus so much on ss shd study other subjects more,btohqsg
yea  esp since SS is just one half of combined humans,btohqsg
Yea but I take combined lot,btohqsg
I mean ss normally q easy to score,btohqsg
Honestly alot of people nvr practice ss and just wack at the end,btohqsg
Cause itâ€™s a long time thing,btohqsg
