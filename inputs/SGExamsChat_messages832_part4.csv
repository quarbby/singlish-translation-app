hahaha am i fucking lost or smth,btohqsg
now it's just scattered cause the same few active ppl got banned or left,btohqsg
this is a telegram group chat based on the subreddit thread r/sgexams,btohqsg
eitherway as stated since the beginning  its just one of thouse spur of the moment thoughts to end your life..so like you said you have no guts  then dont bother about it anymore,btohqsg
doxxing was one of the reasons,btohqsg
just carry on with errands if there is any etc,btohqsg
now my paragraphs bring out all the lurkers,btohqsg
hey its mutual  give them your blessings,btohqsg
the woman was too stunned to speak * mediacorp moment,btohqsg

speaking of which i wanna audition for that new singing variety show,btohqsg
in b4 rumchel quotes you again,btohqsg
js for educational purposes  i've always wondered how do people dox someone,btohqsg
the word helmet at this hour reminds me of that angsty story where the guy riding a motorcycle had his brakes malfunctioned and asked his gf to wear his helmet instead before dying in the accident,btohqsg
like the technical or backend process?,btohqsg
stalking is a level before doxxing,btohqsg
how do people access that in the first place,btohqsg
seems like people are getting doxxed left and right as if their private information is accessible all over the internet ?,btohqsg
some people have a wide range of connections so they either recognize people or have friends who recognize them and share a lot of case sensitive information which ends up gone in the wrong hands,btohqsg
like at least from tele & discord,btohqsg
this is more so for twitter,btohqsg
thanks guys  happy national day  i hate this country though but i can't migrate so don't pofma or dox mety,btohqsg
"Viewer-""i see guy scolding auntie""- not happy.Stalking-""Google guy name on (certain websites)""- find email""use email to find social media accs""-Check locations tags of postsBackend (Scroll through multiple pictures to pinpoint likeliest living or working location)""look at pics and find buildings""Backend (Find Sun direction  Road signs  landmarks)-check said buildings and their coordinatesDoxxing -""Post on facebook the coordinates and tell people the guy lives or work around here in the afternoon""",btohqsg
reminds me of that time in p5 when i got my first phone and then i saw an ad for a phone number address finder app   so i keyed in my friends (female) number and somehow her full address including unit no. just came out of the app. idiot me went to ask her if it was her real address and i never got to speak to her again. smart move.,btohqsg
"BTW  the ""Stalking"" portion is why you dont put anything identifiable in your bio like your school",btohqsg
"Most people will only stop at the ""Stalking"" part Doxxing only becomes a prob when people think they can gain from doxxing you  whether its fame or fortune.",btohqsg
Do you guys think this is true?,btohqsg
DISTURBING:The most vaxxed country on earth is now facing a population crisis.Singapore officials have tried to gaslight the public  but the numbers don't lie.Not only are excess deaths skyrocketing  but birth rates are also plummeting.The cause of this appears to be the infamous COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines.‚ÄùIn 2021  Singapore‚Äôs natural population increase (births minus deaths) fell by 13%. By 2022  it plunged even further to 39.4%.This decline is unprecedented  especially when you consider that the total COVID-19 deaths during this time were relatively low.But here‚Äôs where it gets even more disturbing: Singapore ranked number one globally for excess deaths in mid-2022. Yet  as the numbers began to raise eyebrows  Singapore was suddenly removed from a global mortality database.To make matters worse  a law requiring investigations into deaths linked to medical treatment was quietly removed in 2023‚Äîright when people started asking if the vaccines were to blame.The Ministry of Health claims Singapore has one of the lowest excess death rates globally  but the data shows the exact opposite. Singapore is in trouble  and the government‚Äôs narrative doesn‚Äôt match reality.With births in freefall and deaths surging  how much longer can the truth be hidden?- - - - - -Americans are rushing to gold for a reason. With everything going on in the world  a safe haven is needed to protect life savings.Don't be caught in the financial chaos leading up to the election.

No. I have 2 more kids after covid 19.,btohqsg
No. Correlation is not causation.You might as well be saying million dollar HDBs are because of Covid vaccines cos they happened after Covid. More people get vaxxed  higher property prices. Vaccines cause property prices to skyrocket.,btohqsg
Along that line  vaccines also make flexi-work arrangements and wfh more common. Thank you vaccines üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,btohqsg
this whole media outlet sounds like it's trying their best to gaslight readers instead,btohqsg
Omg I agree with you. I learnt this in analytics but I guess most people back up claims opposing that,btohqsg
i understand how u feel since i was once there too. u can try talking it out w a family member or seek professional counselling like imh. sometimes  it‚Äôs okay to seek help. don‚Äôt mind to seek help in imh since the psychologist / psychiatrist are there to help you. ur feelings are valid. always think about the positive things and things that make you happy ( e.g time spent w ur gf ). know that there will be ppl that love and care for you.,btohqsg
My take : if you really cannot handle the pressure   suicide is a option  you may be slightly better in your next life. BUT  you must note that it may be a selfish one  to yourself and others . Your decision .,btohqsg
Again   I'm telling you to think about the consequence  not trying to tell you to suicide.,btohqsg
Eventually you'll have to face it this life or another .,btohqsg
