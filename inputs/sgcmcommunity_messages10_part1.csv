only in malaysia i use ron97 that is because i have no choice,btohqsg
i dont understand it. what do you mean? who sells a car for 17k a year? renting?,btohqsg
anyway  cut to the chase. what did you buy and how much,btohqsg
some cars require Ron 98 (sports car usually)If dont need Ron 98  ron 95 will do.,btohqsg
yes. follow the manuals. even my m3 says ron95 so i use this,btohqsg
honda fk8r for singapore market is made for ron95. the uk gt line edition and japan market are tuned for ron98 and has 320 ps.,btohqsg
malaysia singapore australia markets have lower power rating due to the fuels the UK factory says (though not true) an so they detuned it a bit,btohqsg
Buy car dun even know depreciation ah,btohqsg
kjust tell me the price la,btohqsg
Dun care den tellU no point,btohqsg
Fd2r$87000   10 year coe. In 202087000 / 10 year = 8700 / year.,btohqsg
great car you can keep. honda type r have now gone up in value,btohqsg
nice car. seem fender color is different from the the rest. rersprayed>,btohqsg
but type r engine is great.  i thought of buying a fk8r but eventually dropped it,btohqsg
Many people tell me it's faster but feeling diff.No more 8600 redline   quiet   just don't feel like old type r anymore.,btohqsg
Only NA engines can do 8600 and more. My bmw can do 8400. Nice sound,btohqsg
95. When using 92  engine could knock,btohqsg
Jdm sti can do 8000. But not reliable,btohqsg
8K rpm first thing in mind is always HONDA VTEC KICK IN YO,btohqsg
B series and K20A series engine,btohqsg
Takumiâ€™s racing engine 11K RPM lol,btohqsg
Oh yea I forgot to mention Honda F20C 9K redline engine,btohqsg
I come to realisation that while I want to save the earth by going EV  but the current limited infrastructure and price is just quite ridiculous.I guess my next car will be the new vezel/HRV. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Sorry Earth. My wallet needs me more. I donâ€™t think the price saving from EV will surpass the price difference. Style vs practicality- I think Im trained to be more pragmatic than stylish.,btohqsg
I think a or mg is cheaper,btohqsg
Infrastructure will potentially be an issue. Yes  govt said they are building more. But I think EV car growth rate will be faster than the rate of new charging port. Imagine queuing for charging port and running around the area to find an empty charging port.Just need a few rotten apples to charge their car and watch a movie   I can foresee it takes at least 5 years plus before there is a new EV norm.,btohqsg
I hope Iâ€™m wrong but I doubt so. Now already got ppl gaming the system. We will face more ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I still think hybrid is a good compromise.,btohqsg
No choice also   as ice will be phase out,btohqsg
Because of the higher gasoline prices?,btohqsg
Nah  even prices of cooking oil also go up,btohqsg
Some car manufacturers already announced stop producing ice car from 2025 and Singapore will stop issue coe to ice car from 2030,btohqsg
Not about pricing but for climate,btohqsg
Now buying new ice car is at your own risk   as they might be of no value soon,btohqsg
Britain to open first coal mine in 30 years because of sanctions against Russia - The Telegraph.ðŸ‘‰ World News | Live,btohqsg
Get the cheapest ev. Renault Zoe,btohqsg
2040 full phase out. I could have changed my car 3 times ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Volvo is 100% ev in 2025 right? And you banned gasoline cars in 2030?,btohqsg
Pretty much hard enforcing that ICE cars will no longer able to renew COE by 2040  like how they did to 2 stroke bikes,btohqsg
They need to settle these liability as a lot of ppl will go back to them for parts,btohqsg
No itâ€™s just stop new registrations only.,btohqsg
They donâ€™t want to be bother with Russ part issue,btohqsg
2030 onwards all new registrations should be EVs and those registered now will just gradually be phased out alr.,btohqsg
and when manufacturer stopped supporting the electronics  also gg,btohqsg
Oh. Renew is fine. Since they can export the car out. I change car every 5 years. Ok la. Still long.I will save the earth 5 years later.,btohqsg
Yes so I said good luck lol if insist in ice,btohqsg
Parts might be very expensive as all stop producing,btohqsg
and by that article  I will not be surprised by 2040  they will disallow ICE to renew COE,btohqsg
I think by 2040 you drive an ice u go to jail,btohqsg
BY 2030 u drive an ice you pay sky high parts fee and petrol,btohqsg
it will be the same fate like 2 stroke motorbikes now.,btohqsg
