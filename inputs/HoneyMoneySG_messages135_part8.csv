will this be the best card to spend overseas + give you lounge access at the same time?,btohqsg
Is using UOB Lady‚Äôs Card (Dining) overseas (Malaysia) directly for 4mpd without Amaze still worth it?,btohqsg
Crmc + amaze is better if you have that combo,btohqsg
Definitely. I will value 8% cashback more than 4mpd.,btohqsg
Dont have the Maybank card sadly.,btohqsg
one of the best cards in the market....,btohqsg
And recently buffed while other banks are nerfing left and right,btohqsg

Hi. Can I check for the 4k required to clock for the bonus miles for DBS  does it include all kind of expense? I am using it for flights and hotel bookings.,btohqsg
hotel and flight expense should be ok,btohqsg
It shows 5944 maybe u can try empty wallet test first,btohqsg
Anyone knows the MCC code for Tengah CCS payment to SP Group?,btohqsg
Hey there is no perks in booking straight from Singapore Airlines using DBS vantage card right? Better to use website liketrip.comto get points right?,btohqsg
Assuming you dont need to change ur booking  yes.Combine with shopback/heymax and trip discount codes etc,btohqsg
How do I combine with these? I always feel like these are really advanced stuff I still haven't grasp.,btohqsg
Just click through corresponding platform then book ontrip.comapp per normal. If can track is good. üëç,btohqsg
so I go onto heymax to look fortrip.com? Then it will open up the app for me to book?,btohqsg
Anyone here register their credit card to visa concierge? Got any benefits?,btohqsg
Is there a need to link card on heymax?,btohqsg
Yes. No need to link card to heymax for this to work.I linked anyway for other reasons like mcc confirmation and monthly cap tracking.,btohqsg
So basically I just click through heymax and I book through the app I should assume I get more miles? Cause no way to check right haha,btohqsg
Usuallytrip.comwill track instantly after making payment. At least it was like that for my 9.9 bookings.,btohqsg
If we booking for multiple parties  must reset from heymax again right? Instead of continuing inside the app?,btohqsg
Hello experts  I would appreciate your advice. This is my first month using the UOB One Account  and I've spent over S$500 with my UOB One credit card in Oct24. However  when I use  interest income checker for my UOB One Account  it only shows S$20. Could you help me understand how the $500 credit card spending is calculated? Does it include all types of spending  or is it limited to certain categories? Thank you!,btohqsg
Have all ur cc spend transactions posted and all eligible? If yes  tracker will update after 1 day.,btohqsg
Yes  the credit card shows an outstanding amount of S$500.,btohqsg
Actually i forgot. U should be able to use atome. Then link atome to crcm directly. Make sure to trigger the payment manually. Dont let it be auto recurring. That will make life easier,btohqsg
1. You mean amount used is $500?2. With $0 in current statement?3. Confirm no ineligible spending?4. Confirm your card statement month is the same as calendar month too?,btohqsg
On UOB e-banking MTD Oct24UOB one account interest tracker - spending $20UOB one credit card - $500,btohqsg
Sounds like a good plan. Thank you!,btohqsg
any listing for qualified eligible spending?,btohqsg
Definitely sounds like some ineligible spendings.,btohqsg
You can check against the t&cs. If it's ineligible spending  it is most likely ineligible for UOB One card cashback and minimum spending too.UOB One account spending criteria is more lax than UOB One card.,btohqsg
Other than citi smrt  what other card is best for unlimited online spending?,btohqsg
Uob kf if mcc is right,btohqsg

Hello  just want to confirm. If I use Maybank family and friends through Amaze at a physical store. It turns to online transaction right? So that mean shopping MCCs from physical store can turn to online shopping?,btohqsg

Hi guys. How do I pay M1 bill via mobile contactless with UOB Preferred Platinum Card to get 4mpd? Is it at 7-Eleven?,btohqsg

Hi all  just moved to SG a while back and need some advice. The first bank account i opened was OCBC 360 and so far i‚Äôve managed to hit both Salary + Save. Now i‚Äôm looking to sign up for a new cashback credit card either OCBC or UOB but i cannot decide which would be better - OCBC 365 to fulfil the Spend category and get +0.6% EIR or sign up for UOB One Account and then get the UOB EVOL card.I know UOB One rates got nerfed recently but i also know UOB EVOL is a better card than OCBC 365 and cashback criteria is easier to hit too. Additional point to note is my monthly expenditure thus far is <1k and mostly on dining,btohqsg
Hi guys is it a good idea to have another separate bank account for daily spending? Cuz my ocbc 3060 I can't seem to reach that $500 the spend part,btohqsg
Hi pro here  does anyone know for the new uob privi miles sign-up promo does Malaysia ewallet topup consider eligible spend ?Because I don't see it in the exclusion list inside tnc,btohqsg
If ocbc 365 cc can fit your spend  ocbc 360 saving acct is good. Its highest possible interest for your use case.,btohqsg
