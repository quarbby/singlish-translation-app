For me it was either that or sci,btohqsg
But i change to sci cos if i main cs my gpa will tank,btohqsg
chem and cs combination sounds cool,btohqsg
cause idk anyone doing this combi,btohqsg
computational chem is a course offered in some unis,btohqsg
most ppl do math and cs,btohqsg
I heard this yr batch got some chem undergrads 2nd major cs,btohqsg
Ah ya but too much math spoils the brain,btohqsg
Later i become a john smith :(,btohqsg
have is have arh but quite rare arh,btohqsg
Wtf don't attack our dear Johnny,btohqsg
I too wish to be an owner of a telegram group spoutin pseudo philosophical mathematics while saying interesting whenevr i dont have a reply,btohqsg
why would you threaten me with what i desire,btohqsg
Blub blub blub blub blub... blub blub?,btohqsg
time to stock up on alc,btohqsg
imo by mid 2020s the world would be so saturated with cs majors something else would be in trend,btohqsg
its gonna be like triple e all over again,btohqsg
there are many triple e majors doing cs jobs,btohqsg
i wonder what job cs grads will end up transitioning into,btohqsg
or maybe im actually a brainlet and cs will end up creating enough jobs for everyone,btohqsg
they can go do postgrad instead,btohqsg
Just wait until we all transfer our consciousnesses into computers,btohqsg
chem engineering was popular before 2010,btohqsg
is 1 of the hardest eng course,btohqsg
it do be like that sometimes,btohqsg
Bell curves during this period were crazy lol,btohqsg
bell curve in computing is not any better,btohqsg
can't wait for market to be saturated,btohqsg
and die unable to pay bills,btohqsg
i cant find a job before i ORD,btohqsg
in the mean time  can audit for online course to expand ur knowledgehttps://www.classcentral.com/,btohqsg
https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19/If u want a cert  some course offer free cert until july also,btohqsg
@UnderscoreNeilDotStry DInosaur Science HAHAHADino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology from University of Alberta ★★★★★(55),btohqsg
I dont need a course to tell me how to tell a dead dinosaur from alive,btohqsg
There's actually an online Cs degree course lol,btohqsg
cos now got covid  some course that used to cost $100+ is now free with cert,btohqsg
If you just want the knowledge  watch mit lectures can liao,btohqsg
If u wan industry knowledge watch those developer videos oso can,btohqsg
If u wan the cert go uni,btohqsg
But they are just lectures hahaah they have no incentive to teach u about modules or frameworks that are being currently used,btohqsg
The stanford ones are quite new,btohqsg
Anyway topics like programming methodology and data structures and algorithms  old also nvm one la,btohqsg
U compaver avesge branching factors of deep mind programmes,btohqsg
Both on same fundamentals but which one more efficient and why,btohqsg
Ya but i mean those cs fundamental topics like algo theory,btohqsg
The theory is ultimately the same,btohqsg
Anyway alphago make use of monte carlo search tree algorithm,btohqsg
Which honestly the underlying math behind it existed long ago,btohqsg
Things like framework all these u can learn from developers la,btohqsg
All these will evolve over time,btohqsg
