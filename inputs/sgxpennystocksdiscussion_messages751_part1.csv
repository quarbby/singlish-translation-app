Alibaba Co-founder Jack Ma Steps Further Away From BusinessJack Ma  the billionaire co-founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba  is giving up the controlling rights of affiliated company Ant Group  according to a statement on the latter’s website on Saturday.The ten largest shareholders  including Ma  have agreed to no longer exercise their voting rights in concert and will henceforth vote independently.Ma currently indirectly controls the voting rights represented by 53.46% of Ant Group shares via investment vehicle Hangzhou Yunbo  but the change will effectively remove Ma’s control of the company  and leave him with a mere 6.2% of the voting rights  according to Bloomberg calculations.Both Alibaba and Ant have faced penalties from Chinese regulators over the past two years. Alibaba was slapped with a record $2.8 billion fine for antitrust abuses.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
