For all those rich fellas who bought LHD supercars and can't register them in Singapore  here is a solution1) Declare ur house as an independent state from Singapore.2) Apply for UN membership3) Register the car as a diplomatic/consular car for use on SG roads with a CD plate. Don't need to pay ARF and COE as well,btohqsg
Of course the downside is everytime leave ur house need to chop passport,btohqsg
later u show customs then the officer like what,btohqsg
Otherwise how Peter Lim can drive his Veyron,btohqsg
