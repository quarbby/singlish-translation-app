Hi I‚Äôve been spending more than $650 per billing cycle on my UOB EVOL card but I don‚Äôt seem to be receiving the amount of cashback as I used to ($30-$40). Could it be that my SP utilities is included in the $650 that I‚Äôve spent that‚Äôs why I wasn‚Äôt eligible for cashback?,btohqsg

utilities should be totally excluded  dun count to min spend even,btohqsg

Hi all  just some questions to ask I‚Äôm doing DCA every week USD$300 into QQQM but I split it in to half $150 on Monday and $150 on Friday.Should I just one shot buy $300 so that I can save $1.98 or just pay that $1.98 fee ? Because if I continue this for 1 year it cost me $103 üòÇ just for the fee,btohqsg
Hi Qi An  $300x52 weeks = $15 600. $103 / $15 600 = 0.6%. If QQQ does average return of 5-7% per year (not including dividends if any)  0.6% is not meaningful. Good luck,btohqsg
Soo in short is to buy $300 instate of splitting it in half ?,btohqsg
Ntuc income shield premium counted for uob min spend?,btohqsg

So need to wait for physical card ?,btohqsg
"not the right way. comments dun count. Try do FAST transfer and select purpose as ""salary payment"" from dropdown list",btohqsg
Hmm I used to do that through OCBC  but there's no longer such purpose under dropdown list,btohqsg
Oh hmm I see salary payment in DBS  I'll try that route. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi what would u like to know about options,btohqsg

basically most options traders can make money but cant keep the money,btohqsg
well i can  i have been profitable  you?,btohqsg
haha how long have u traded options? I am a futures spread trader  options very little,btohqsg
how old are you? 4 years for me trading options,btohqsg
4 years is not bad  gone through 2020 covid crash and 2022 market correction,btohqsg
haha age doesnt matter. if u want discuss more about options  can join Swim W Options  i am admin there,btohqsg
0.6% is enough to make investors switch ETFs to save on expense cost. 0.6% compounded over 10-20 years will be a huge number. and likely costs will go up over the long run  so in future  this difference may grow to 0.7% or 0.8%,btohqsg
What if 1.2k per month? The fees will be negligible at this point,btohqsg
