1 Tow to inspection centre2 Buy road tax3 Buy insuranceI think that's about it. Pretty easy. But the car must be at the workshop or carpark address indicated in your layup application at all times.,btohqsg
does it need any special criteria? for lay up?,btohqsg
Wah read the part about parf,btohqsg
If you layup you lose your parf,btohqsg
i think best to lay up is COEd car right,btohqsg
is it worth conveting e30 to  classic car status come 35 years old?,btohqsg
Are you asking if Grab only has taxi only? They still have other cars on my friend's app. Once I tried downloading their competitor Gojek because of some gimmicky hook but when i downloaded the app  i could not see the bait.,btohqsg
My friend's app still has GrabPet and Hitch,btohqsg
scammer responded to me today! üòÑ,btohqsg
Thansk‚Ä¶. Realise that too but must like press to reveal all the options‚Ä¶. Used to be can see say 3 options at a glance.. thanks üôè,btohqsg
Hi  besides no need to pay road tax  what other benefits are there for lay up? Thanks,btohqsg
Environmentally speaking too. Unless people carpool.,btohqsg
A number of E30 is already on classic plate,btohqsg
whose 4444 parked on 44? rare collector. belongs to anyone here?,btohqsg
actually already a legened. arton senna car i think,btohqsg
i know where this owner lives. i saw this many times,btohqsg
that's my car heard in tunnel!https://youtu.be/oMav2rJWgG0,btohqsg
Kluang to mersing route. Nice drive right,btohqsg
And also thumbs his nose at number superstitions...,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aXj7YZcsankJason's Cammisa video are simply top notch.Electric vehicle is definitely the future.,btohqsg
You don't have to pay for renewal of insurance as well. But I don't think it's a benefit per se. Most people won't need to layup a vehicle in their lifetime if we only own one vehicle. Youll not need to layup unless you won't be around in sg for an extended period of time  too many cars  if your license revoke etc.,btohqsg
4 is a brilliant wonderful number,btohqsg
I saw the e39 m5 in German Essen motor show 2000. German polizi used for highway patrol. Car has roll cage.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a special car with manual transmission.,btohqsg
would you buy a car with such condtions?,btohqsg
So quite strange this layup Is around ‚Ä¶.Those with few cars‚Ä¶ insurance and road tax is like‚Ä¶.If they are concern they wun buy in the first place,btohqsg
lay up is good for inactive car usually people who have more than one car,btohqsg
in malaysia  youdontevenhave to apply. it is automatic if you dont renew insurance it means you dont want to use it,btohqsg
This is so stupid!!!!!! Dun renew InsurAnce means they want to cheat,btohqsg
Hi bro  it‚Äôs says a specified garage‚Ä¶. Does it mean it really has to be an a garage? Or u can park at home? Thanks,btohqsg
can be anywhere. must provide address,btohqsg
the malaysian system is better. well you can drive the car on the road without insurance sure. dont get involved in accident,btohqsg
but when you decide to renew it after one year y9ou must send the car for inspection,btohqsg
only then can you buy insurance and then road tax,btohqsg
the malaysian system is also fair. if you buy a car that has tickets with it  you wont get penalized.,btohqsg
although the previous owner may have lots of tickets,btohqsg
U mean in Sg u have to pay forPrevious owners‚Äô fines?,btohqsg
Singapore system is such that if u dun do lay up‚Ä¶.u have to pay insurance such that there wun be an issue‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Workshop or carpark also can. Just need to give the carpark address.,btohqsg
Yes. It‚Äôs offense. In Malaysia you don‚Äôt have to do anything. It‚Äôs deemed you don‚Äôt want to use it. Using it without valid insurance substitutes offense,btohqsg
You cannot drive a car on the road without insurance coverage,btohqsg
In Malaysia owners register expensive cars in langkawi to escape tax. And drive their cars in peninsular Malaysia for 3 months.,btohqsg
And then retried the cars to langkawi,btohqsg
Play car. Best to do it in Malaysia,btohqsg
Can keep as long as you want without inspection. Inspection is only required when you sell,btohqsg
Cars in Sg is for show ‚Ä¶Not to play one and indeed they bring their cars to Malaysia to play,btohqsg
can paly just within speed limit,btohqsg
Dun play play   especially normalHuman‚Ä¶ later kanna SG VGL‚Ä¶. Then pple u know start to telegram the whole world and again your boss and HR knows,btohqsg
I mean keep the car beyond 10 years or more and there‚Äôs no annual inspection,btohqsg
I floor at every red light or overtaking   just within speed limit   signal and don‚Äôt do things like brake game   there is nothing to scare of,btohqsg
