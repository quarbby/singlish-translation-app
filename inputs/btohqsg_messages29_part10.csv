U need get married after getting keys 3 Months.If not this is a fail system  hdb say must legally married after keys collected within3 months.If not ppl can get don't get married liao. Might as well i say my ROM is 5 yrs later now i get sbf can ? Cannot la,btohqsg
Can just ROM first. Den do your wedding ceremony/banquet anytime thereafter,btohqsg
meaning if my estimated completion date is dec 2026  when is the latest i need to ROM?,btohqsg
Can't be sure one. U check your ROM date is when .Then when u received your appt to collect keys call hdb say can collect on xxx date will do.Either u collect after your ROM dates before 3 Months or u collect before your ROM,btohqsg
Okay but another thing is  example if I get the SBF but the keys already ready to be collected. Wah Sian kanchiong Sia. ü§£ü§£. If can I want get the project which completion next year at least . But I know we can't choose uhh,btohqsg
results for sbf should take about 2months.. and need to wait for hdb to schedule appointment for selection.. so can start to register slot for rom if you are worried,btohqsg
Do we need to head down to HDB to submit the marriage certificate after ROM (assuming keys alr collected)? Or can upload it online,btohqsg
get a queue number then worry,btohqsg
Ok that's why hdb give the timeline. And also sbf when can collect keys or Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 is to let Plubic knows estimated when can collect keys so u all plan your ROM in time right,btohqsg
Sbf already keys stated ready to collect and if u still no ROM blame who ???,btohqsg
Already stated ready to collect means for ppl that is ready to move in ma.. if not ready go choose other sbf to ballot lor,btohqsg
If im hdb i say already stated ready to collect and now one couples say ROM is next 6 months what will hdb do ? Aiyo don't test the system . Just go ballot what u all think is suitable.Ok GoodLuck ha,btohqsg
Actually I just checked. All is mixed up leh. So if let's say get  I could get either the ready for key collection or the ones still under construction. Cannot choose ah.,btohqsg
Like that might as well normal BTO. No need risk. Thanks guys,btohqsg
can chose depends on queue position lor.. if get tailend queue only can chose among the leftovers,btohqsg
Yes . When in 2022 I was also in this situation.Go for BTO or SBF and SBF is like shit  the units is like 1 or 2 or single digits  how to get ?And i go for BTO   get Q number and never look back,btohqsg
Sorry  so sbf with key available already. Must ROM within 3 months or 6 months? Before or after collect keys?,btohqsg
You need to solemnise your marriage within 3 months of collecting the keys to your flat.,btohqsg
May I ask how do I do that for punggol project punggol point woods  punggol point crown and punggol point cove ?,btohqsg
You can try btohq website and download the brochures and do analysis there.I‚Äôm unable to find any analysis on stackedhomes for these projects,btohqsg
If u collect keys todayYour ROM cert must submit to hdb 3 months from todayIf u can understand,btohqsg
How about if let say 1.5 or maybe even 0.9 ?,btohqsg
1.5 families competing for 1 unit.OR3 families competing for 2 units.ORProbability of 1 family getting a unit is 1 / 1.5 = 66.67%,btohqsg
Hi. Any group for marsling peak bto?,btohqsg
SBF tough to get cos too few unit available n some are repurchased flat. Especially 2nd timer I think chance is zero.  BTO also low chance for 2nd timer but at least more unit . Long waiting time though like 4 years .,btohqsg
Please keep us informed when HDB sends key collection date hougang citrine.,btohqsg
Hi  from what level and below is consider noisy?,btohqsg
Hi guy   sorry I‚Äôm first time applying hdb. Can I know what does this rate mean ? üôèüèª,btohqsg
How many families fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
Theory is that noise travels upwards. So the higher your unit  the louder and more pronounced the sounds are.But it depends on many factors,btohqsg
Hi  I read that SBF downpayment is 10% if take HDB loan  does that mean HDB will loan 90%? because HFE letter write a lower max loan amounthttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/procedure,btohqsg
if max loan doesn't cover 90% then you'll have to cover the shortfall with cash,btohqsg
HDB will access your combine income statement to see how much loan can they give u.Ahhh can't be my combine Income is $2K  i can loan up to $300K .What they loan you the X amount if not enough u need top up with cash .Hopes this help,btohqsg
Your question is like no matter how much we earn we also can get the 90% loan of the flat purchase. Which is like a no i think,btohqsg
SBF seems to be 90%  unless HDB hasn't updated their website to say 75%?https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/procedure,btohqsg
seems like a loop hole.. or uncertainty,btohqsg
Hmmm likely they forgot to update this ba,btohqsg
ya  very misleading. 90% is so long ago liao haha,btohqsg
tbh it says:pay 10% or 20% of the flat price respectively as the downpayment when they sign the Agreement for Lease- I would assume to pay another 15% upon key collection.,btohqsg
Ah that makes a lot of sense!,btohqsg
The page doesn't mention it at all but that is probably it lol,btohqsg
Ya haha. Anything just call HDB to clarify,btohqsg
I am a 2nd timer. Any idea do I need to pay levy for SBF?,btohqsg
not sure if just my observations  seems like this time BTO applications rate for 4room and 5rooms seems relatively low for almost all projects compared to previous.. SBF so attractive?,btohqsg
i guess likely need to pay as SBF also subsidized even for repossessed flat they are much cheaper than resale,btohqsg
so if im a first timer and the rate is below 1 that means there are enough units for all the applicants?,btohqsg
Still subject to ethnic quota though,btohqsg
Helloo anyone applied for the MCPS before?,btohqsg
Hi all! I‚Äôm getting married next year Jun and just want to check if i apply a SBF that already have keys available  is it a must for me to rom 3mths after getting the key?,btohqsg
I was wondering what happens if after key collection and all  our parents decide to move? Its like around 4.5 km away kind or 5km,btohqsg
