Are there still any money hacks around? Like exploiting for interests gain?,btohqsg
Interested to know too. Any idea?,btohqsg
Yes we are all sure.. it's a when not if thing. Just like the interest cut,btohqsg
Hi can I check for standchart journey cc   if I were to buy an item with installment does that count towards the eligible spend to receive the welcome bonus?,btohqsg
Want to seek you guys opinion:Im doing reno for bto soon  expected to spend around 80k  is it worth it to use city payall 2.2% admin fee to convert the 80k into miles?,btohqsg
DBS took too long to submit my GIRO.. luckily I submit all the rest of the banks first  at least this month I can still get something,btohqsg
people will tell u depends on how u value miles,btohqsg
I'm testing Maybank Platinum Visa + CardUp then HSBC GIRO for monthly insurance premiums. I hope it works. Waiting for the quarter to end.,btohqsg
dunno if it's clearer in the tabled email,btohqsg
I submitted on 22 mar  1 apr rcv sms said set up,btohqsg
I have already subscribed to either funds of Moomoo Cash Plus. Is the existing subscription eligible for the 6.8%p.a.?Yes  the currently subscribed funds of Moomoo Cash Plus may also enjoy the 6.8%p.a. Return.For example: If you are currently subscribed to S$10 000 in Fullerton SGD Fund  and then subscribe a fresh fund of S$50 000 into the same Fullerton SGD Fund  the full amount of S$60 000 is entitled to the 6.8%p.a. guaranteed return for up to 40-day. After completing the deposit task and becoming eligible for the 40-day 6.8%p.a. guaranteed return  at least one Cash Plus purchase must be made to start calculating the returns,btohqsg
Always a cash back person but want to experience taking business class in this life time.. and feeling a bit wasted if get nth in return for the 80k,btohqsg
I submitted slightly earlier but only received the SMS today. Maybank one very fast  UOB followed few days after.,btohqsg
I spoken to moomoo Cs.They say new fund only.I'm confused.BTW  the Cs I spoken to I don't really understand his accent,btohqsg
Their CS some are CMI.. not sure if you remember  but prior to this 6.8%   there was another similar campaign .. that one was better because it does show the number of days...,btohqsg
This time abit hard to know if we getting the 6.8% .. don't have countdown timer..,btohqsg
It's based on your first cash fund purchase. 31 days,btohqsg
Hahaha can always book a 1 way $700 flight to Malaysia on SIA business class for the experience. ðŸŒš,btohqsg
U can call in moomoo customer service. They pick up v fast,btohqsg
With the drop in UOB and Standard Chartered interests.. where is a good place to park 200k idle funds? Is there any changes to UOB stash account which sits at 5% for 100k savings..,btohqsg
You can search the chat for the whole of this discussion since the morning.,btohqsg
Can consider moomoo if u dont have an existing account. Now they got promo which extends up to 200k for as long as 60days,btohqsg
Oh.. wha. Kinda disappointed with the UOB interest drop.. I know it's a sooner or later thing.. but I didn't expect it to be so fast.. I just started this for 3 months ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Maybe the best option now is to invest in equities.. if can afford small risks.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account at 3%* p.a. you mean? You can put 150k to UOB One account for 4% p.a.. And participate in the earmark promo.,btohqsg
It is good that government launched SSBs and it allowed many people in Singapore to easily invest $100-200k of their funds into no-risk instruments paying 3% p.a. ish..Rates when come down  can really come down fast and we end up looking at 1-2% p.a. accounts.,btohqsg
Maybe can try investing in$BABAand$RBLX.. *non-financial advice*,btohqsg
Actually this group got a lot of members . Can create HoneyMoney cryptocurrency ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows what is the mcc when you puchase a deal/voucher on Kris+? Does it follow the MCC of the brand offering the deal?,btohqsg
MB Plat V doesnâ€™t exclude insurance. Can pay direct to save Cardup fee. But be mindful of the 50% insurance rule. E.g. 2k insurance hv to split 1k direct n 1k cardup,btohqsg
That's why CardUp to bypass the exclusion. Another problem is it's Visa which not a lot will take for recurring premiums  so CardUp.,btohqsg
Serious ah!? Okok! Thanks later I try!,btohqsg
Yup. For me  GE accepts visa. So I split 50-50 to save on cardup fees instead of 100% cardup,btohqsg
Abit troublesome. Am looking for a card to pay of all. Then giro pay off that 1 card,btohqsg
GE don't accept CC payment for most policies from over 5 years ago. But I also finished paying my GE premiums liao... So nothing to pay to GE.,btohqsg
You can use DBS Credit Card to pay other CC Bills??,btohqsg
Change insurer? ðŸ˜‚ kidding of course,btohqsg
Haha like I said lor  other insurers I using CardUp already.,btohqsg
Did anyone do an updated comparison of best HYSA for different balance amounts?i.e. best at $25k  $50k ...  $150k?Or is UOB One Account still the overall best for now,btohqsg
With this calculation  maximum how much interest for the month from May?,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/184380You can use the 2nd table values Ã· 365 Ã— number of days.,btohqsg
U be paying 1760 in fee for miles so really depending if u want to buy the miles for use,btohqsg
So If we have 150k in UOB then $500 interest?,btohqsg
@itsfioreina$700 single way business class trip to Malaysia for experience is cheaper ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Go by days to be accurate.,btohqsg
The banks make it deliberately complicated so you cannot compare them easily. Most if not all of the higher yield savings accounts will have salary and spend conditions.,btohqsg
Hi.. understand that Amex TCB exclude instalment plan as eligible spend.. does it apply to atome as well?,btohqsg
Last data point was 1 year ago and it was eligible. Maybe you would like to check the t&c?,btohqsg
Heard Capital not guaranteed though interest is..Thatâ€™s scaryâ€¦how often u deposit capital and it drops?,btohqsg
