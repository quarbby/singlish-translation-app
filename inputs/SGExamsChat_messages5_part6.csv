I thought i told the entire SGExams my combi b4 HAHA,btohqsg
I must have not been there for it,btohqsg
question why are there so many indian/pakistani students in the other grp lmao,btohqsg
im thinking maybe they google a level group,btohqsg
and because we don't say it's singapore a level,btohqsg
maybe I fucked up the combot settings and it's public in combot rankings,btohqsg
was gna say we too smart for as levels HAHA,btohqsg
I love how NS influences ppl so much,btohqsg
Look at John making all those ns jokes,btohqsg
Was the ncc band the one that played for my POP,btohqsg
can someone help to explain this like what does the 0 8 9 in 0:8 and 1:9 means.thanks,btohqsg
no longer in swiss yall have nothing on me now ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
kueh acknowledge me as og Kevin uwu,btohqsg
tbh he's the more og kevin,btohqsg
excuse me I joined when that dude kick us from the main subreddit,btohqsg
does anyone know how fast will it take for someone being discharged from NS while in service ?,btohqsg
depends on what youâ€™re being discharged for,btohqsg
Idk Python but if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
{i: n} will be the i-th variable  printing out at least a length of n,btohqsg
"It's like print(f""{1}{0}"" ""foo""  ""bar"") should print outbarfoo",btohqsg
"Meanwhile print(f""{1:5}{0}"" ""foo""  ""bar"") should print outbarÂ§Â§fooWhere Â§ is whitespace",btohqsg
But I might be wrong idk,btohqsg
depends how fast your S1/G1 do their job,btohqsg
my friend got a 60 day MC,btohqsg
youâ€™ll be surprised the amount of MCs the S1 branch has to process everyday,btohqsg
did anyone do plastic surgery before ?,btohqsg
i have no idea how he get it. LOL,btohqsg
OK nvm what I said earlier,btohqsg
ok i think i get it 0 is the index position of the object in the bracket after format and 8 or 9 is minimum character thing with padding (please correct me if im wrong danke),btohqsg
I wonder why 8 or 9 tho,btohqsg
Hmm it's the newer string formatting method right just learning format in case i encounter it in someone else code,btohqsg
*gets seizure due to the Py2-style c0de*,btohqsg
Ooo python 2 is the one that uses .format ?,btohqsg
Not really but f-strings were added in Py 3.6,btohqsg
Yeaa and % is the older one rite,btohqsg
Avoid old-style code like the plague pls,btohqsg
Hmm is it safe for me to learn python 3 now,btohqsg
What do you mean by 'safe',btohqsg
Pls no learn c0ding cuz eberiwan is doing it,btohqsg
It is useful if it is useful,btohqsg
It is not useful if it is not useful,btohqsg
For Python to be useful you need to find AT LEAST ONE use-case for it. There are metric tons of use cases  but nobody in the world knows what's your usecase.,btohqsg
In general you don't even need Py  but it is easier,btohqsg
Not sure yet I just started out,btohqsg
A simple example is perhaps you have a Windows Directory of 993 images  and you want to rename all images by their 'date modified' metadata,btohqsg
Then Python 3 is useful. (You could probably also BATCH script it but I wouldn't recommend it),btohqsg
A more typical moolah example is you want to mish mash statistics out from datasets ('data scientist') - Any number of tools will work and Python is just one of them,btohqsg
Anyway AFAIK NUS many engin/sci programmes all have introductory computiong modules  so there's also that. For beginners I'd recommend Python (as compared to Esolangs  C or even just Arduinos),btohqsg
I see I don't plan go nus tho my rp too low,btohqsg
I only mentioned NUS  but IDK about other unis/courses,btohqsg
