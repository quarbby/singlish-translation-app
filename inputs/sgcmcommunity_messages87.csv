Is the driver ba not the car,btohqsg
But sometime faster car is safer,btohqsg
less likely ur family will grow up to be glue sniffers,btohqsg
more like join the  family in heaven faster,btohqsg
Fast car no use. Alot of hoggers causing my family to be glue sniffers,btohqsg
No la what I mean is some times faster car can get you out of sticky situation,btohqsg
Hais then my family will be glue sniffers…,btohqsg
fast and big and bright headlights,btohqsg
gotta practise the two right hand fingers pulling movement,btohqsg
Fast car but never upgrade handling,btohqsg
Well I mean generally stock cars,btohqsg
Fast car stock no nid upgrade handling. From factory handling match with speed.,btohqsg
But I think car flip is all due to drivers la haha,btohqsg
I said that is becuase I see some drivers ego too big   don’t want give way   but car not fast enough then get to accident,btohqsg
But generally is dangerous driving la,btohqsg
eh but honda jazz more likely to flip,btohqsg
Vezel ez flip cos of height and 1.2ton only right?,btohqsg
But what’s the point got fast car but driver slow,btohqsg
U see some acceding like right turn   car impatient then want to turn right   but car too slow kana t Bone,btohqsg
Family will still be glue sniffers,btohqsg
Or merging lane don’t want give way die die want cut ppl   car also too slow and kana accident,btohqsg
Impatient driver with slow car is a receipt for accident,btohqsg
Gov shud increase speed limit as a whole to not breed a country of glue sniffers if like that,btohqsg
Is not about the speed limit,btohqsg
Cos got vigilantes first lane speed limit ma,btohqsg
Those kana 1 is like so fast,btohqsg
We shd be like Germany then everyone get home onti.me.,btohqsg

Anyone know where’s a nice place to buy car wash and accessories stuff?,btohqsg
Or not  petrol station also have basics to start.,btohqsg
I just realised what it mean! Eh it is legit very good lehhhhhh. My boss go their certification course woah so impressed with their work one,btohqsg
Best price always at Taobao 😄😄,btohqsg
Their selection is huge though. Go take a walk through when have time bah,btohqsg
Hmm will give it a go! Any preference for which outlets to go?,btohqsg
Quite personal but I go the one at Bukit Batok reserve there before. Quite nice.,btohqsg
Noted! Maybe will head down there later since I’m going nearby there,btohqsg
Let us know how you find it!,btohqsg
Was thinking of doing my own car washing humble side hustle  like maybe wanna start off in my car park  friends and families  don’t know should I anot,btohqsg
I think some of the kors kors here have done before!!!,btohqsg
Need advices if any body have experience before!,btohqsg
Not easy. You be competing with pump station n bangala. Can you provide the same service at a lower price?,btohqsg
I would say start off with 10-15 per wash? Like a basic ones,btohqsg
When I get enough  for sure I will do a good car wash including tire wash  and abit of basic waxing that will start off around $30+,btohqsg
Got a lot of bangala doing,btohqsg
I saw the pail of water they were using. Pity the last car they washed.,btohqsg
I believe my service will be better than bangala,btohqsg
But my house carpark here don’t have any washer thou,btohqsg
"I believe they don't ""wash"". They merely wipe the cars with a pail of recycled plain water.",btohqsg
Which will leave them with a lots of water marks eventually  and damage the paints isn’t,btohqsg
Oh...no water source other than from your home? Tough leh bro...,btohqsg
Oh have is have  I mean like no workers to wash peopl car,btohqsg
Ah...I see....if no existing competition at your area  I guess u can try rather then regret not trying later. 😁,btohqsg
The only Heinz I know sells beans (beans means Heinz),btohqsg
They got ketchup also. I add that to my rice towards month ends.,btohqsg
Now petrol station charge $11 per wash. I suppose not many car owners willing to pay this amount for a wash. If you can do at a cheaper rate  then you might have a chance.,btohqsg
I already see $12 at some sir,btohqsg
I would assume it's not just the price,btohqsg
If@woshijordanjrcan offer a better quality wash with good equipment and do it within the confines of the carpark,btohqsg
I wouldn't be surprised if people would prefer it,btohqsg
As they don't have to drive to the petrol kiosk  don't have to worry about cloths used  don't even have to leave the house if they trust him to move the car within the carpark,btohqsg
The pricing depends on how much his equipment costs him and what his cost of consumables per wash is,btohqsg
And how much he values his time at,btohqsg
But there is always a market when a more convenient and quality offering is available,btohqsg
I only can do it like whenever o free to earn some extra cash! Because in the day  I will be in school,btohqsg
I will only be free like at night sometimes and weekends,btohqsg
But to gain people trust  I not sure whether will it be easy,btohqsg

How about allowing the 5 year COE to extend another 5 years?,btohqsg

They will ask u to drive it back,btohqsg
Then wait for parts to come  then drive back to workshop,btohqsg
Total loss it… get one new replacement for old,btohqsg
Maybe that’s why workshop says insurance premiums will be high,btohqsg
Maybe allow COE to be transferred to new cars when owner decides to replace cat after 4 to 5 years  just scrap the car and make use of remaining COE on the new car🤔,btohqsg
??????? 0% NCD? Other people’s name?,btohqsg
U 0% NCD right? Ur A200 only 1.3k?,btohqsg
Anyway if it’s yours   and u r young  u can expect ur premiumTo go up a lot…. Some will decline u,btohqsg
It’s “ a lot” …. Ur damage and other ppleDamage ….should be above 5k?,btohqsg

If ur insurance has a new for old clause. U get a totally new car,btohqsg
Otherwise I think it’s based on ur market price of existing car,btohqsg

Not a fan of the jupiter colour tho,btohqsg
Dis time rnd dealer lose money if guaranteed coe,btohqsg
So its not always dealer make money. Unless they decide not to honor contract / run road thats another story,btohqsg
Depends on the contract lo but during big inc usually 1 bid guarantee lose money(for dealer). 6bid den prolly they will delay abit,btohqsg
If say dealer put 1bid guarantee coe when coe was at 96k last mth den prolly wah lose 14k lo. Factor the car total price maybe arnd 4k loss.Coe -12k den +14k. They earn money last mth to tiap dis mth loss.,btohqsg
true true  but aiya dont worry their premium is 50-60k some 100k per car  4k is nothing to them,btohqsg
Nothing to you also cos u paid full price,btohqsg
HAHAHA walao i got for a good deal,btohqsg
i sell now still can make quite abit,btohqsg
But i was watching the cupra formentor price. Was 207k dropped to 201k when coe dropped 12k,btohqsg
i waiting to see whether i need sell 2 kidneys to buy Polestar 3,btohqsg
Imagine they sold at 195k  now coe go up 14k. They probably vomit blood,btohqsg
At 207k it was already 13% premium,btohqsg
their premium so low but nobody buy….,btohqsg
Sad case for them. I hope they dont end up like alfa,btohqsg
alfa was clearing stock that time  very cheap,btohqsg
But they also smart la  they reduce 6k in orice when coe drop 12k. Managed to hedge abit,btohqsg
But still the amount of sales,btohqsg
Vag is just bleeding from there,btohqsg
When coe drop they usually drop lesser and then offer credits or other benefits,btohqsg
Sounds wrong LOL. Volks augi grp is bleeding from cupra,btohqsg
Most dealers are almost dollar for dollar,btohqsg
you know wearnes is losing money on all their other brands except volvo😂😂 now i know why my premium so high,btohqsg
Use volvo to cover other losses,btohqsg
Coe -10k.Car price -5k  give 3k in servicing credits,btohqsg
U probably covered the bugatti showroom for a month,btohqsg
And ya polestar3. 450k still got buyers,btohqsg
Glad to contribute  where is my guided tour into wearnes warehouse👹👹,btohqsg
Hahaha.  I heard they dont even bring out the bugatti without the owner's consent,btohqsg
I like it. Im still confused with the ps2 looks,btohqsg
