Remark:personal experience opinion - I🙆🏻 don't encourage our Singaporeans to invest in new builds property opposite unless is resales one with gd location & even economy bad also can find buyers,btohqsg
Exactly so I never buy any property in Malaysia for investment. Can loss doubly or more. Capital loss n currency exchange loss. Get Lousy rental too,btohqsg

But still hv problrm of depreciating currency leh unless their politics get right,btohqsg
