Sometimes I think it might be better for the council of presidential advisors to advise the president on the dissolution of parliament rather than PM? Even though PM is head of state but a little conflict of interest since is in a political party?,btohqsg
Wonder what is the point of voting then? Hmm...,btohqsg
Council of presidential advisors should not have political party affiliation,btohqsg
And they can see from the point of view of the current economic  health  security climate the appropriate timing to call for elections.,btohqsg
They can only trace the polling stations,btohqsg
