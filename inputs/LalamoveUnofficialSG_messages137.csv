Yeah  see if any shifu here done before  can share their experience,btohqsg
This considered little liao mah I tot,btohqsg
No. Can be anywhere. But usually clustered.,btohqsg
If u not lao jiao u could take sibei long to complete,btohqsg
Let me chip in with my 3 cents worth of knowledge. Yes it's possible for that driver to have earn almost $300 on those days he show. But u definitely need to stack. N a few other conditions. 1stly u have to manage to win the bids of those high price jobs. Depends on many factors whether u can win. 2nd u need luck to have the stacked jobs nearby each other  either drop or pickup. 3rd  it's almost impossible to have everyday have many jobs with high priced. 4th  yes u can drop then go somewhere far to pickup high price job. But in the long run  the mileage u clock up really doesn't make much good financial sense for wat u earn. And u need add in the traffic which can make things tough for u when u stack. Nov n Dec traffic very low cos of holidays. Back to normal after that the traffic is a bitch,btohqsg
U were asking abt ft possible,btohqsg
I would say if u do ft,btohqsg
Ur not gg to get such good income most days,btohqsg
Unless festive season or heavy heavy rain,btohqsg
you can join my amazon flex group to ask the members there,btohqsg
not sure if i can post any links here  scared tio ban üôà,btohqsg
Now heavy rain also must see LLM mood. üòÇ End up only the vendors up tips or you risk taking rescue orders from Oddle,btohqsg
just in case anyone decides to join amazon flex... just to let you know first hor... amazon is a bigger bitch than LLM,btohqsg
(but earnings are usually better than LLM),btohqsg
40mins from jurong west to harbourfront then to whampoa?,btohqsg
Yah. As in he left jurong west at 7pm to drop at harbourfront then pickup the whampoa order at 740pm?,btohqsg
That is abit near impossible cos of traffic and time to park n drop etc,btohqsg
That will depend on price and time üòÇ,btohqsg
If it's very late and no other jobs n the job go towards my home and price very good then I'll takeüòÇ,btohqsg
But I doubt 40mins can do the above jw - harbourfront - whampoa,btohqsg
Rent car to do llm ft really not feasibe,btohqsg
Ur income will all go to rent n parking n petrol,btohqsg
I drive own car so I still ok,btohqsg
yup i responded to those that DMed me liao,btohqsg
you just need an asshole of a customer to complain about you once and twice and YOU'RE OUT,btohqsg
doesn't matter if you really did anything wrong as mentioned by customer,btohqsg
e.g. late delivery or missing delivery,btohqsg
November can lahh. Surge everywhere. Not everyday Sunday lehh. ü§≠,btohqsg
Hahaha that idiot asia guy still at it ah,btohqsg
Csnt accept that it's possible to do 300 In 15 hours?,btohqsg
Until I lazy explain to him,btohqsg
15 hours 300 is definitely doable la,btohqsg
Want talk cock also at least make sense,btohqsg
Yiu say 10 hour maybe hard,btohqsg
We all know you fucking ridiculous,btohqsg
I delete away is because got order number for my privacy,btohqsg
For you I put in abit effort,btohqsg
Earlier afternoon I playing mahjong lazy entertain you,btohqsg
I put in effort to block order if also,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't like your flooding.Yghas been temporarily muted for 1 hour.,btohqsg
No point fighting right? Whats right is right   who believe believes  just stay away from those scam orders   no point fighting who is right,btohqsg
What matters most is we can do llm   pt or ft doesnt matter  can earn   can do   thats the main point of this,btohqsg
Llm made us ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù life hard already whats the point we fighting against each other for? Just if you willing to do just do  if not no point whining,btohqsg
Hi morning  my 1st time doing early morning. Question is the ERP we have to pay ourself or charge customer?,btohqsg
Pay yourself. Might want to communicate with the sender first. Otherwise try and take the non-ERP route.,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't like your flooding.Asiahas been temporarily muted for 1 hour.,btohqsg
Fren dun agure with him. Even if u could done this amount. Dun need to envy him.this kind of distance he is earning less than $10 per hrs after his petrol,btohqsg
If rental car more jialet. If own car than TC. High maintenance,btohqsg
Lol I think for those who really count the distance and hrs the earning after llm commission will make new driver wake up the idea,btohqsg
He is earning a 250 netts . Make it simple and easy. He top up $70 petrol every day and car park?? ERP?? I dun think he will go that fast during peak hrs without goin though any ERP,btohqsg
He is making $150 after everything's that is deducted fren,btohqsg
New drivers u all think it's worth the money and effort?,btohqsg
And driving on the road for long hrs is not worth it,btohqsg
Not only heath is that one accident only the whole month earning will be wasted,btohqsg
I used to drive 2.4 full time last time. And the most I do is 8 hrs per day,btohqsg
If I will to do 15hrs I rather wrk for a company that cover mine insurance,btohqsg
250 per day for sedan driving 8hrs per day. Those days will gone long ago Liao,btohqsg
If rental car he is making less than $10 per hrs,btohqsg
Llm stand for low labour mover,btohqsg
Now adays ppl only use llm to boost their income abit,btohqsg
From 9plus am till now I only do 5 job,btohqsg
Is it I slow ar ?,btohqsg
If sedan normally u must take 1 multi stop and stack orders on the way,btohqsg
This way the money will be abit more faster,btohqsg
Jus giv Urself target by earning 30 per hr $9 less than 2km jus take,btohqsg
Cus u nv know wat order will come out next,btohqsg
Yeah cus sedan only can see courier and sedan job,btohqsg
Unlike 2.4 can see mpv 1.7 and sedan,btohqsg
So courier job also must take,btohqsg
This is the highest I do when I am on the mood,btohqsg
But mostly mutistop and stack order on the way,btohqsg
last time got 1 legendary walker say he can do $300 in a day. üòÇ now drive car can see $150-$200 considered v good alr,btohqsg
This 1 my ytd. 1st job was at 1140am. Last job 8pm,btohqsg
As stated b4  only during festive season,btohqsg
Only 1 multi stop of 3 stops,btohqsg
730 1 job after com $40,btohqsg
Deliver from clarke quay to keong saik,btohqsg
8pm 1 Job $30 from.mbs to sentosa,btohqsg
This type is once a blue moon,btohqsg
If u heng u get it,btohqsg
Anyway wat I'm trying to say is,btohqsg
Is not impossible to hit high amount,btohqsg
N need luck to have the job appear n u win bid,btohqsg
Sure if u take all sorts of jobs at any prices maybe u can use quantity to hit the 300 u all talking abt,btohqsg
Long distance  long hrs  high costs,btohqsg
I the type maybe I spend 6-8 hrs outside,btohqsg
But I don't drive all the way,btohqsg
From 4+ until 730 I no do any job cos no job worth doing üòÇ,btohqsg
So I can afford to do that lahüòÇ,btohqsg
I have criteria for job I take 1üòÇ,btohqsg
Mileage no high  price good then I take,btohqsg
Ya same. No good price and can't stack I won't do. Aft so many weeks finally started again but only took 3 jobs over weekend üòÇ,btohqsg
Later show u some of the jobs I do ytd theb u know what I talking,btohqsg
I have a job tmr $120Deliver laundry bags and collect back,btohqsg
My criteria short distance higher price otherwise no do,btohqsg
I selfish so I cover the pickups don't want let pple know take from whereüòÇ,btohqsg
So far haven't come across vendor/customer will pay erp for u 1,btohqsg
If regular job can we stack!,btohqsg
Cos llm write erp included in price,btohqsg
Understood. Cos 1st time I do in the morning,btohqsg
Llm cannot do ft that's it,btohqsg
Especially drive car  worse still rental,btohqsg
How abt this? Cos just now I stack 2 just customer make noise cos it take 1 HR to reach,btohqsg
can stack if you confident can complete both within 1 hour from pick up,btohqsg
Yes I finish both within 1 HR. But customer make noise,btohqsg
U need to know pickup/drop off well plus routes. I always make sure can finish in less than 1 hr both jobs then I stack,btohqsg
N if ur jobs both food that's more impt. Not nice to have food late n cold. Increase chance of complain,btohqsg
Some customers don't like/want u to stack 1 n will monitor u when u doing the delivery,btohqsg
So better for u to try n find our urself. Then get regulars,btohqsg
For food usually I straight send. If can I Siam don't do food.,btohqsg
But in lalamove rules we can stack rite for regular and pooling? Correct me if I'm wrong cos I still new in this lalamove,btohqsg
Today 1st time encounter Customer not happy cos I take 1 HR to reach her place,btohqsg
So far for 2mths I'm doing no customer say anything,btohqsg
best is to just give customer a call then you can prioritize which one to deliver first if you stack. but for me is  deliver the first order that i picked up and call the other order's customer to inform that there will be slight delay. But make sure both within 1 hour,btohqsg
some customer  30mins also they make noise liao hahaha,btohqsg
as long as they dont complain to LLM can liao,btohqsg
1 ear in 1 ear out,btohqsg
Anyone notice price of the listed order decrease a little after accepting the job,btohqsg
Notice for the past 2 days... E.g saw the order at $25.... Accepted the order but it turn to $24.50,btohqsg
It only decrease... But never increase instead,btohqsg
The worse drop was about $1.50,btohqsg
@Chloe18221call me boy. I come down explain to you in person,btohqsg
I bring you around do with me,btohqsg
Sin e you talk so much right,btohqsg
Of cause I stack orders la idiot,btohqsg

We come down discuss in person in details,btohqsg
I show you my past orders also,btohqsg
Since you so interested In this conversation,btohqsg
You know how much of a loser you are anot,btohqsg
You dk got some orders they book in advance no delivery?,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't like your flooding.Yghas been temporarily muted for 1 hour.,btohqsg
Haiya all same2 Cari makan argue for what. What you get is yours.,btohqsg
Today I do stack llm and grab more suiüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I never go for gem boss. I hit $100 daily I go home.,btohqsg
But riders of really wanna do full time can. But cannot book shift must play open. If shift a bit diff but doable,btohqsg
Cannot say like that. Some people like to do. I got colleague salary 6-7k but do grab additional 4K,btohqsg
Yup but I like when raining. Danger but the $$ shiok,btohqsg
We no need argue in here. All here same find $$. Help one another,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok bro. Mayb he can achieve that‚Äôs why he share. But it‚Äôs ok all happy2 only,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok never kena caught still ok kena caught then diff story. If all the way go by right we lose llm win.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs my take anyway today waze save me from tp camera 2times,btohqsg
Wah cannot contact customer after reach place now must rtn back to sender,btohqsg
Wah tdy my luck not that gd,btohqsg
Wow the live chat very fast ended B4 finish typing,btohqsg
This kind ask sender to pay or just ask permission from sender to leave outside customer address.,btohqsg
Make sure got evidence if you do that. Picture and black n white message from sender that it is ok to leave there,btohqsg
I see the fare now like shit,btohqsg
Go register Foodpanda/gf if u don't wanna fetch ppl,btohqsg
Cos the price not worth it  to me lahüòÇ,btohqsg
Then those worth it 1 I lose bidüòÇ,btohqsg
Both no answer boss. I go back their shop rtn,btohqsg
Really not a gd day today. It ok try again tmrw,btohqsg
You got referral codes to share ? üòÖ,btohqsg

Wow sg 2-0 up against Thailand üí™üí™üí™,btohqsg
Haiz  quality shows in the end,btohqsg
waiting list period is at least a few months after successful application... there are guys i know that waited for more than 6 months and yet still under the waiting list,btohqsg
gl if you are planning to sign up with amazon flex,btohqsg
Morning guysDon know today can $300 le not,btohqsg
I just aim for usual target of $100/day üòÇ,btohqsg
Wah this one difficult i tried but could not reach it cause LLM from my 1 month experience now after 10pm job very2 slow,btohqsg
I usually start ard 10+ 11am. Then will b outside until 7+ 8,btohqsg
If hit 100 early  then remaining is extra bonus lorüòÇbut I have to say again. I choosy for jobs 1üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
If anyhow whack any job sure can hit 100 lah  but not worth it. Price low mileage high cost high  hit the 100 minus costs also very little,btohqsg
However it's up to your situation. If u r in urgent need of $  u may cheong more in terms of quantity to hit more. For me I'm satisfied with 100/day,btohqsg
Cos I have side gigs/private jobs also,btohqsg
But I see ytd n tdy. I think this wk will slowdown liao until Xmas eve Xmas n maybe this wkend. Prob almost no more Xmas gifting liao,btohqsg
Have to wait until 2 wks b4 cny again,btohqsg
Then after cny will be like ghost town for many months,btohqsg
Wise man. Now already gonna be ghost town already. Not much orders after lunch,btohqsg
I at Redhill now see Jon,btohqsg
But the price like shit don know how to take sia,btohqsg
Not wise. Is cos do llm many yrs liao so know how it is on the ground üòÇ,btohqsg
Like I said  see your own priorities is what lor. Tbh  sometimes I cannot even hit 100. Cos I don't cin cai take any jobüòÇ,btohqsg
This is reality of llm. If u want hit gross 100-150 yes can hit. If u take machine gun just sweep any job,btohqsg
But after minus machine gun bullets and maintenance in long run  nett is low,btohqsg
If u do like me  try to 1 shot 1 kill sniper  then be prepared low gross but higher nett lor in long run. But not suitable for those who need fast cash or with high commitments,btohqsg
Last few years this month always got surcharge almost everyday leading up to Xmas and even NYE. Now everyday cui üòÇüòÇMiss the days can take 1 order within a km radius for 30++,btohqsg
Ya I also avoid long distance not worth it,btohqsg
That night I heng managed to getüòÇ,btohqsg
Clarke quay to keong said after com $40. No1 bid when I bidding. I was praying no1 bidüòÇ,btohqsg
Actually after covid less n less liao,btohqsg
Many advanced oddle jobs for Xmas Xmas eve come out liao,btohqsg
Let's hope no1 takes until actual day then all will +++üòÇ,btohqsg
Last year they still assign the Oddle jobs at $42 each. This year bo liao üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
That was for Xmas or cny ah,btohqsg
Then maybe this yr less orders so don't need,btohqsg
The lala guy will call and ask,btohqsg
He got call me la for mooncake,btohqsg
Maybe cos I hardly take oddle liao,btohqsg
He told me CBD area I straight reject,btohqsg
Need go up office building rabak sia hahaha,btohqsg
Ya this year v quiet liao. Usually this week easily can get high surcharge,btohqsg
Tdy got some decent multi stop jobs,btohqsg
Like this take correct le not,btohqsg
As long as within 1 hour if not sure kena complain. Then they will deduct your earnings means you deliver for free,btohqsg
1 hr from the time u pickup,btohqsg
Play around with the timing u shld be ok,btohqsg
But u also abit Âñò leh,btohqsg
Oh also oddle orders very kpkb 1. They very anal abt the timing. Better do faster or u will kena jot form,btohqsg
Quite sweet but need prioritize oddle or if not just give the customers a call say there will be delay. Usually they are ok if you call,btohqsg
Ya man. Now sibeh on the ball also. Will keep msging ask where are you lol,btohqsg
Do llm how can don't know oddle üòÇ,btohqsg
Used to b good then think biz drop now shit vendor,btohqsg
Lose too much money on double order,btohqsg
Can finish within 1 hr..bike or car?,btohqsg
Slowly u will get used to it,btohqsg
But when holidays over the traffic will be bad so take that into consideration when doing stack,btohqsg
So how was ur llm ytd? Do good? üí™,btohqsg
Now festive season not bad 1,btohqsg
I wonders what‚Äôs the qualifications of Lalamove CS. Knn live chat to tell them the customer unreachable even send them screenshot of WhatsApp and call log. They still keep telling me to tell customer to cancel. Wtf?,btohqsg
Rabak. Still dare collect platform fee from people,btohqsg
Why lala now keep deduct extra $0.50 from fare ?,btohqsg
B4 take job see fare $20  accept job alr become $19.50,btohqsg
Starting16 December 2024  a platform fee of$0.50will be applied to every order and automatically charged to users on our platform.This fee helps us continuously enhance our service quality while improving safety and protection measures for our driver partners. Do take note that the driver's earnings remain unchanged.Please clickherefor more information.,btohqsg
Basically they earn not enough want take more lor,btohqsg
Employ useless CS still wan more money,btohqsg
I do from 11 plus till 6 around 150 like thatThe problem is like can‚Äôt reach $250 also no pointPay oil pay car earning 150 like that,btohqsg
Actually is can la just like working LorBut like not worth cos driving is at tired job also la,btohqsg
Just wait for peak timing and take stack order,btohqsg
LLM project car job offer $6.50 lol not so cluster. Joking sis,btohqsg
Depends on how much u want make lor,btohqsg
Yah tdy really cui off peaküòÇbut earlier have a number of decent jobs,btohqsg
Tdy I just do 1 llm n later 1 private get total $99 then pküòÇsee if can get any llm job bring me to private job pickup areaüòÇ,btohqsg
Either u do llm with other platforms or u have private gigs,btohqsg
Just llm alone hard to survive,btohqsg
"Ya but mostly long distance  office area or ""big"" surprise job hahaha.",btohqsg
The least LLM can do is to ask the customer specify the order items. Nb I heard Oddle purposely remove also because they can't get driver for big order ü•±,btohqsg
i gave up talking to LLM customer service... same IQ level as Grab... all IQ level 10 only,btohqsg
I like ofc areaüòÇmany of them my fansüòÇ,btohqsg
that's why i give priority to my regulars who pay me direct,btohqsg
when they saw me accept their job on LLM  they whatsapp me tell me they will cancel the job on LLM and pay me direct ü§£,btohqsg
this kind of regulars hard to find,btohqsg
Pooling job  4 cartons‚Ä¶.hah‚Ä¶all the best,btohqsg
Want cut costs end up cost more,btohqsg
Better cancelWait delay  your car stinks of meat water when thawWorst  they complain lalamove and send them goods cost invoice  llm straight deduct you $300++ from wallet and suspendVery common nowNot your faultBut u pay,btohqsg
Cheapo wan to do Biz but save on transport,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. Plus these 4 cartons are MPV standard based on the total weight and volume.,btohqsg
Whenever who got this pooling order please tell customer that their items is not going to send immediately but within 24 hours/end of the day  if customer don't want to top up the cost just ask them cancel. It is pointless to argue with them. The stupid ideal to have this pooling pricing should blame LLM let them settle with customers.,btohqsg
Even 2.4m van also can have pooling  what is meaning for van keeping items for 24 hours/end of the day?,btohqsg
Full load use pooling but send immediately all this are nonsense by LLM  leave this type of orders be there forever,btohqsg
Confirm got some hungry ghost will take one lah,btohqsg
It is ok for someone take the order may be his destination can take it along like same direction/area,btohqsg
That's exactly what I notice this whole week... At least commission is listed. This auto deduction is like kena cheated,btohqsg
But I will not do that,btohqsg
Let the hungry one do lo,btohqsg
Covid time was good. Till 2022 then spoil market liao,btohqsg
I did lesser job from LLM this year because of the pricing,btohqsg
You can try grab  price not bad,btohqsg
