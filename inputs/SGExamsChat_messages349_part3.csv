Stop stealing what I'm best at,btohqsg
Hey guys just wanted to ask,btohqsg
How important is a uni degree for financial comfort in Singapore,btohqsg
Neither of my parents have a uni degree but they earn enough to live comfortably in a 4 room flat with 2 children,btohqsg
Is that hour idea of financial comfort?,btohqsg
not enough  u need uni degree from harvard  mit  stanford  cambridge  oxford  as well as masters and phd from all the schools mentioned above,btohqsg
on top of that  u need to be the owner of Apple  Meta  Alphabet  Tesla  Microsoft,btohqsg
dabbling in the stock market is not a must  but its highly recommended... your annual returns should be at least 10 000% in order to outpace inflation,btohqsg
other than that  u just need to work 25h a day  8 days a week,btohqsg
should be relatively easy to accomplish :),btohqsg
Labour Productivity increases thus increasing SRAS which shifts the SRAS curve downwards,btohqsg
Depends on what is considered comfortable for you and also sector coz not all require degree to progress. My colleague is a dip holder and got 4rm with a newborn daughter. Her hubby also working.,btohqsg
I think as long as you don't splurge on an expensive house or car u shud be fine,btohqsg
Just get a normal house and normal car,btohqsg
last time different. Both my parents stopped education at O lvl and survived on single income all the while.,btohqsg
There are too many factors. Some Grab riders are earning between 6k to 8k monthly,btohqsg
There's alot of debate on how much money to lead a comfortable life,btohqsg
So I would assume that comfortable life means that1. No need to worry about food2. No need to worry about water or gas or electricity.3. If u stop working  you can survive for at least a month or two?,btohqsg
Obviously if u think that buying a 2k jewelry every month is comfortable then prob u need higher income,btohqsg
But for the average household basic needs are enough,btohqsg
3 is debatable. Two months would be quite uncomfortable.,btohqsg
I seen some people survive for a few years,btohqsg
6 months to a year at least for me,btohqsg
think many in SG can. Depends on lifestyle.if spend $1k a month  $24k can survive 2 years,btohqsg
Then u have to take into account children?,btohqsg
my household expenditure with kids is like >$6k monthly,btohqsg
I mean if u get rid of tuition assuming he is independent.,btohqsg
Then again children's baby formula is expensive,btohqsg
But that's if u get the expensive brand,btohqsg
when I was on my own living with parents  I spend <$900 on most months,btohqsg
If u were to breast feed the baby and let's say purchase cheap baby formula.,btohqsg
I think u would be able to survive on very little money,btohqsg
so want to save  do it before marriage 😂,btohqsg
Imo if u are weighing the price of formulas its probs not financially comfortable alr,btohqsg
Children are an investment of their own,btohqsg
They can generate income for u next time,btohqsg
