Math doesn't deviate much in CHS cuz they still obey the amath emath split,btohqsg
So CHS taught uncertainties and projectile motion in y3? wow,btohqsg
But schs like RGS do teach the entirety of functions and transformations,btohqsg
We did projectile motion and circular motion at least,btohqsg
that one not in o level ?!!,btohqsg
You mean those with powers above 2 ah. I thought e math has inequalities but linear,btohqsg
I mean this is just my own experience,btohqsg
Actually my sch did teach the,btohqsg
I'm more interested in CHS scheme of work now,btohqsg
Method they use in h2 math,btohqsg
Like the u draw the number line,btohqsg
Then u identify positive negative regions,btohqsg
We learnt that in sec 3,btohqsg
But I think they just never tested it,btohqsg
I will look through CHS 2022 phy prelim papers,btohqsg
I guess it wouldâ€™ve been manageable thatâ€™s why they taught,btohqsg
Idk what chs does now maybe times has changed since I graduated,btohqsg
I keep reading chs as college of humanities and sciences,btohqsg
when i started tutoring i was a bit surprised at whatâ€™s actually o levels lol,btohqsg
Cuz ik alot of the chers left and went to jcs to teach,btohqsg
bc i can only base it on my sch,btohqsg
Oh that one. My friend hates her,btohqsg
Eh she not bad tho back in chs,btohqsg
At least for me I could just purely listen to her and could do the paper,btohqsg
Didn't rly have to study or practice out of it,btohqsg
Interesting  the paper I have is labelled CHS (O Level Programme),btohqsg
did you learn evolution in y3 and y4,btohqsg
so the O level programme and IP Programme learn different things,btohqsg
Oh nvm I think she just scolded him for some petty reason even tho she didnâ€™t find out the full story,btohqsg
But maybe her teaching is good,btohqsg
"ok so that day we were doing an activity where we had to identify cell organellesso like we had trouble and the teacher was like ""i give you a hint: thylakoids"" and then i was instantly like ""choloroplast ! ðŸ˜†"" and the 3 jae girls in front of me were like ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯and teacher was like "" yall never learn in o levels?"" then they said "" yea its a new term"" then i was like"" jh got learn"" then she said ""ooh nice""",btohqsg
Oh wait junwei isit u thought that o level and ip teach the same things? Cuz its not they teach diff stuff at diff pace,btohqsg
Only the science tdp students from o level and ip would be combined tgt,btohqsg
Then they would do their own lessons (normally with jc content cuz the o level students would learn the ip stuff + more),btohqsg
Ya doesnâ€™t make sense they learn the same stuff,btohqsg
at least for cedar  it was almost the same things,btohqsg
like how much not in o lvls,btohqsg
i think he went through but not tested,btohqsg
Evolution is in o level syllabus,btohqsg
yea ik but pob ask me,btohqsg
and DHS  NYGH  NJC IP syllabus is almost same as O lvl,btohqsg
But idk whats the direction now,btohqsg
i heard a trend for IP moving towards O Levels,btohqsg
Eh I actl only realised how many things not in O lvls after joining sge,btohqsg
i think they wanna minimise the gap,btohqsg
at least for dhs cause we started accepting jae intake in 2019then i heard rumours from a graduated senior that they removed alot of alvl contents from y3y4 syllabus because it was a bit difficult to bridge in jc (with the ip alr learnt  then is totally new to jaes),btohqsg
so they cutting back just for the jae students,btohqsg
is it the jae students complain,btohqsg
the only way around that would be to separate jae and ip into different classes,btohqsg
but that would just make things worse,btohqsg
