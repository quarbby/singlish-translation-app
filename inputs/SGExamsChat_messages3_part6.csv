Friend you are not in deep shit fighting for the basic human rights that have been taken away from you,btohqsg
Wait  is it even legal for the maid to be in a relationship with her employer?,btohqsg
wat are the rules here? :D,btohqsg
Lol I mean my maid will do smth,btohqsg
Oop did I kill the chat?,btohqsg
I'm Apple from bukit timah poly,btohqsg
Wait are you that Apple that likes purple,btohqsg
thats not being toxic  thats being righteous XD,btohqsg
@sgmathhelperHave you considered sitting down as a family and discussing your feelings with them?,btohqsg
That's why u in my server mah,btohqsg
I don't think it's healthy for internet strangers to create a narrative about your father without knowing his thoughts and feelings,btohqsg
Well I was hoping it work because he did mention that his dad is educated,btohqsg
We’re all just inventing our own fictions,btohqsg
@sgmathhelperBut yeah try your best  family is irreplaceable but if they become so toxic and unredeemable  at one point in life  you have to learn to let goYou're not at the age to think about this yet but don't feel obligated to remain in an abusive/manipulative relationship,btohqsg
She’s the same age as us,btohqsg
I assume most of us here are 18 and above,btohqsg
technically my birthday hasn't passed so,btohqsg
Also don't think it's healthy to share such personal things in such a large group of 2k+ people,btohqsg
If you ask me everyday you’ll eventually find out,btohqsg
can we do better than that O(n) algorithm?!,btohqsg
So it’s definitely not on the dot on top of the i,btohqsg
tbf i rather he share it in an exam group where the average IQ is higher than that of a random interest group,btohqsg
jk that's a pretty elitist thing to say,btohqsg
But at the same time you’re assuming all 2k+ people belongs to SGExams targeted demographic,btohqsg
There are worse occasions to hear those words,btohqsg
True true  it's a very bad assumption,btohqsg
But i would like to contest and say that the few hundred people who actually talk and don't lurk  belong to the demographic  would you say that's a fair statement?,btohqsg
Might even be less than a hundred imo,btohqsg
I can think of one instance that wasn’t through  but even if that is true  it is not safe for the lurkers to be reading so much personal info about her. We don’t know who those lurkers are.,btohqsg
Fair fair  I concede my case,btohqsg
But it’s anonymous so no one knows if it’s a real or not anyway,btohqsg
I can't wait to use NUS Confessions when I get accepted (assuming that I do get accepted),btohqsg
But if somebody wants to with enough info  they can CSI her if they wanted to.,btohqsg
Erm it’s open to public lol,btohqsg
I am an honest and honourable individual  I will not use it unless I am an actual undergraduate!/s,btohqsg
Altho ngl NUS confessions have some juicy stuff,btohqsg
I'm still thinking about my options  I'm confident I can get into NUS Civil Engineering if I put first choice (thanks to the 1.25 points thingy?)  but I really want to try for Philosophy through aptitude-based admissions,btohqsg
Should have tried harder for As,btohqsg
Do you possess any technical skills alr?,btohqsg
Not necessarily but Civil Engineering is appealing to me because my father has 50 years of experience in the construction industry  so I assume I'll be able to inherit some of his skillsets and alongside with the degree  be able to lead a successful career,btohqsg
Have you studied what he does?,btohqsg
Coz tbh philo is the softest of the softest discipline ever  and this is coming from an Arts student. I have some interest in philo too but I decided against it coz I realised I have a lot of soft skills with no technical skills to attach them to.,btohqsg
What are some examples of 'technical skills'?@Hamsomy3,btohqsg
are you referring to skillsets commonly held by STEM degrees?,btohqsg
Not yet but I am intending to if I get into CE,btohqsg
STEM is a subset of technical skills but I won’t say it is the entirety of it,btohqsg
But yeah I completely understand the practical concerns of pursuing a philo degree,btohqsg
not completely  but i understand the magnitude of the issue,btohqsg
Yea I feel like philo is a great enhancer  but it is useless if you have nothing to enhance.,btohqsg
School should never be your only method of learning. Have seen Philo students and grads going into software  data analytics  finance  entrepreneurship. All the technical skills picked up on their own outside of school,btohqsg
