If bank loan can use card on cardup to get the cash then use it for mortgage payment,btohqsg
If you want to pay with your phone  then link to GPay.If you want to be notified of your ride transactions  then link to SimplyGo.,btohqsg
https://blog.cardup.co/personal/mortgage-loan-credit-card-via-cardupreally wor‚Ä¶ but there is a 2.6%.,btohqsg
Ppl pay fee to buy miles,btohqsg
Use the physical uob card to tap directly on the reader counted for the $500 spend?,btohqsg
evening all...UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion can do both the fresh fund deposit & submit the form on the same day right? was thinking of 30th april..as the lockin period would be 3.5 months instead of the full 4 months right? TYIA!!,btohqsg
Yes can be done on 30 apr,btohqsg
you have no control when they decide to earmark the amount,btohqsg
Can  but why want to be JIT warrior? Just register now and deposit on 30th morning.,btohqsg
Hi üëãüèª   newbie question may I know how to use CPF OA to invest in CFA REIT? Which platform?,btohqsg
oh ya hor? they will take the date of the later action,btohqsg
but even they earmark on the very next day..also 3.5 months..if their 16 August is chun enuf,btohqsg
Usually by mid month will earmark,btohqsg
But if you drop below the participation amount any day before the earmark  you also lose your earmark and have to register again,btohqsg
The money is with them for approx 4 month coz u cant touch it before the earmark,btohqsg
Ho which saving acct is better? UOB1 acct or uob slash acct,btohqsg
4% at 150k or 3% at 100k?,btohqsg
Thanks. I saw the advertisement say that slash acct can earn up to 5 percent?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt T bills returns is better?,btohqsg
if it's 3.8% when i buy...then yes...lol,btohqsg
Was reading milelions post on what credit cards he uses for each category  but for some reason Amaze + CRMC wasn't listed  any idea why? Confirm Amaze + CRMC has bonus points for groceries or supermarkets right?,btohqsg
Question. Is there a max number of UOB cards that a person can own?,btohqsg
Owe? Like don't pay?Own - As many as they have and as many as you're eligible for I guess?,btohqsg
don't think they will restrict since the credit limit is shared,btohqsg
What card do I use for... - The MileLionhttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/#groceries,btohqsg
"Did you try clicking on ""full article""?",btohqsg
Guess it's the style of writing  but maybe should put in Amaze + CRMC but write some remarks,btohqsg
I guess you can feedback this to Milelion rather than here. Crmc+amaze is still ok for groecery now,btohqsg
He‚Äôs mentioned it previously that he doesn‚Äôt write A+CRMC everywhere because its true  and it would become tedious to keep mentioning that in almost every section since the combo is super flexible.,btohqsg
There's a whole section for amaze too iirc,btohqsg
Just wanna share and update bros here.. 8011 also excluded.. All the clinics no matter private or govt that i checked r under 8011 so gg all my cashback gone from 6th May,btohqsg
It‚Äôs rather interesting. Only Uob absolute Amex is being so harsh about all medical spend.Other cards for example Uob one only excludes 8062https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/tncs-governing-uob-absolute-cashback-card.pdfhttps://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg
Can share which private hospital‚Äôs clinic are under 8011? I understand public are under 8062.,btohqsg
But linking googlepay to amaze card does earn 4miles per dollar correct?,btohqsg
Hi guys  has anyone encountered an additional $0.50 charge on every transaction with their Instarem + Citi Rewards?It shows up as this on my statement:AMAZE * WALLET TOPUP 6569501123 SGP,btohqsg
Did u spend more than 1k locally with amaze? This is 1% charge (min 0.50sgd) for all transactions after the first 1k.,btohqsg
That sounds like amaze wallet topup... And is chargeable cos it's using visa.,btohqsg
The ben yeo immediate 1x cipro is obviously a scam right ?,btohqsg
Most ads are just scams lol.,btohqsg
Trust card tap on public transport eligible for the trustbank additional 0.5% interest?,btohqsg
Pending transactions won‚Äôt count. Only count transactions posted within the month,btohqsg
Oh ok. How many days need from pending to count transactions?,btohqsg
No  but did spend more than $1 000 overseas.,btohqsg
What does this page in under amaze card say? Can't think of other reason. If this value is not above 1k then check with their customer support.,btohqsg
Did you use amaze to top-up another wallet? Like tng  ezlink?,btohqsg
Hi..I'm new to the miles game..For Citi reward Card. 4 miles per dollar..1. Got expiry?2. Where and How do I use the miles?,btohqsg
Fair price/ super markets won‚Äôt earn you 4 mpd on hsbc revolution cc  anymore,btohqsg
4mpd on certain offline store and 4mpd for online provided mcc not excluded. The point is in citi point and can be exchange for voucher but value not as good as miles. U can choose transfer partner when u accumulate 25k citi point. Expiry is 5 year from your citi reward card is open. The cycle is every 5 year the point will expire,btohqsg
20 May onwards seems like HSBC Advance excludes hospital MCC liao,btohqsg
