‚ö†Ô∏è Parents  take note of these popular online games which can become a hotbed for bullying.About 1 in 5 gamers aged 13 to 18 feels bullied in video games  a survey found. ‚Äãhttps://str.sg/5N6R,btohqsg
they act like this is news,btohqsg
tldr they cited discord  minecraft  roblox and genshin,btohqsg
he said he left cause the nsfs are unbearable,btohqsg
but imo its just him being overly idealistic and cant take it when people have realistic considerations ? ü§Ø,btohqsg
he say yall keep talking about money and ns,btohqsg
im inclined to think that the money part is not even that much,btohqsg
"oh ya when yt was banned he made his nickname ""bedok is banned from sge""",btohqsg
yea i would prob just lurk and let rand showcase his talents,btohqsg
"but the thing is josh is like "" omg rand is always talking about money his only priority is money why cant he get a life?"" bro rand is studying business ???",btohqsg
Ngl kuro ur being too kind. If it was@juicecogenshe will wish for josh to not get any scholarship,btohqsg
Yea but you arent actl affected right,btohqsg
Im weeks behind of my own work,btohqsg
"the jae gp bridging is ""difference between o level el and a level gp""",btohqsg
If dhs ip students actually wrote decent gp essays,btohqsg
Then I won't be so critical of it,btohqsg
Tbf most ppl dont actl care about gp,btohqsg
Thrs literally no difference apart from1. Everything is argumentative2. You have more passages for compre,btohqsg
Ya cuz last time it didn't matter whether u got an A for GP or a C for gp,btohqsg
Now it matters more lol cuz the range of ur scores are shrunk,btohqsg
Nah trust me all schs make gp too complicated cuz they dk wtf to teach also cuz gp is just writing,btohqsg
Bro thinks that everyone who doesn't agree with his worldview is unbearable,btohqsg
Its not even a nsf issue anymore,btohqsg
This is why I heavily believe that people going to psych are those who need help the most and expect psych to give them the support they need,btohqsg
from the model essay book my teacher gave i realised that most ppl in my sch who do well for gp (aka have their essays published) are those who alr have very good foundations in el (and maybe lit) since jhlike some of them eds chair  top cohort for el  debate champion etc,btohqsg
It's cause some schs mark gp essays based off the quality of bombastic language,btohqsg
Cuz its the most objective way to mark,btohqsg
but ofc those ppl are minority since tbf dhs population quite stem oriented also,btohqsg
Which is why naturally people who have good foundations in English would do btr,btohqsg
actl not rly the essays i see arent that bombastic is quite easy for someone like me to understand (for my sch),btohqsg
Singaporean chers cannot delink the penalisation between contact and language,btohqsg
also damn clown in y1 they ask for fun fact then idk what to say i said idl maths and sci then now üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
some arguments dont even make sense,btohqsg
Ok tbf what did you expect,btohqsg
tbh most sg students for gp they js whack cause,btohqsg
the way i define good language ability which is very different from good writing ability is1. Your writing does not sound like a robot (which somehow 70% of essays I read cannot meet)2.  There is consideration of your overall essay at both a local and global structure,btohqsg
smth more interesting and complex that actually makes me think,btohqsg
theres not much emphasis on like writing,btohqsg
"within sg  a lot of people that are ""good at english"" only know how to use it in specific ways",btohqsg
ngl when yall say this about hci and ri i wonder alot,btohqsg
cause the jc cohorts of hci and ri are perceived to be like the cream of the crop in sg,btohqsg
but then theres also ppl like me who promoted with shitty grades leh,btohqsg
