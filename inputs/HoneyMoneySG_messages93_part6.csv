Hi all  need advise.Currently would you go for ( home loan)1. 3.1% fixed for 1 year and reprice next year ( 2 yrs lock in)2. 2.9% fixed for 2 years ( 2 yrs lock in)Appreciate the advice.,btohqsg
Is this currently now? Outside of Changi Airport?,btohqsg
Yes. Now. You can check courts online. Not sure about GST.,btohqsg
I want to know too. Just ended my previous fixed rate,btohqsg
My experience told me number of years to lock in is also a key factor to consider. When you want to reprice with same bank  the bank usually will offer you loan interest rate that higher than other bank.Look for other bank that has 1 year lock in to compare.,btohqsg
Can share which bank offers you this rate? Roughly what is the loan amount?,btohqsg
Because you include the AppleCare+.If you dont want to buy AppleCare+  click the bin to remove it to save money.,btohqsg
Tnc clearly stated in OCBC 360 account for Save category. You check the date and time of the MAB last updated.,btohqsg
How to ensure UOB direct waive annual fees instead of deduct my UNI$ for waiver,btohqsg

OhhhNow that‚Äôs cheapppp‚Ä¶ budden 16 coming out soon in Sep,btohqsg
"Hello Thank you for introducing Bonus$aver to the community!I plan to sign up Bonus$aver today  and have some questions.1. I can charge my Prudential policy premium anytime through the ""Online Payment"" option on thehttps://www.prudential.com.sg/.Does anyone else here doing this too  to qualify for the Card Spend requirement?2. For the ""3 Bill Payments Online of min $50 each"" - I see IRAS-Income Tax listed.¬† I currently have active installment arrangement with IRAS through GIRO-Auto Debit.I plan to use the Online Bill Payment option on Standard Chartered to pay the monthly installment partially to IRAS and let IRAS deduct the balance.¬† Can this work?Thank you in advance  for the guidance.",btohqsg
hi which merchant deducts immediately when a credit card transaction is made,btohqsg
i meant   when the  transaction is  made  it reflects an immediate deduction on the credit card statement,btohqsg
Any recommendation on which credit card is good for standard chartered?,btohqsg
any specific use case ? or just for CC rewards ?,btohqsg
Just for cc rewards and to hit the bonus saver requirement,btohqsg
1. Insurance not excluded in card spend T&Cshttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/bonussaver-product-terms/2. Should be ok,btohqsg
both have same lock in. in order for option 1 to get average 2.9% rate  year 2 needs to be 2.7% to be averaged to 2.9%. I don't think within 12 months home loan rates will drop from 3.1 to 2.7%  esp when fed will earliest drop fed fund rate from May-24 (and home loans typically takes a while more to reflect the reduction in rate from Fed),btohqsg
Ahh? I thought ezlink reload to simplygo  then use the ezlink which registered in simplygo for transportation. I don't get cashback for ezlink reload?,btohqsg
bonus saver can only use bonus saver credit/debit card to clock card spend bonus interest,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I use Citi rewards + amaze and get 10X points for private hospital bills?,btohqsg
I paid StarHub bill online with ocbc card on 25th  until now still pending üòíIs this pending status only update once a day?,btohqsg
There is no cashback for ezlink reload for most CC. What does the tnc for your cc say?,btohqsg
starhub is historically slow. mine also not posted today. probably tmr  hopefully!,btohqsg
Fd should not impact 360 account MAB  including other saving type in ocbc,btohqsg
Don't think so. You can check the t&c,btohqsg
Hmm.... was thinking might drop to 2.5 in Yr 2,btohqsg
Just checked  really no cashback for ocbc 365üòî,btohqsg
bonus saver i not sure  but i apply for simply cashback for CC  rewards,btohqsg
Anybody receive this from Fairprice? If use the Fairprice voucher to buy $30 items in Fairprice store qualify for $5?,btohqsg
Hi  for OCBC 360 bonus interest from salary  must the description be ‚ÄúGIRO - SALARY‚Äù specifically to count?,btohqsg
main thing is must be from corporate account with purpose as salary payment,btohqsg
So then that suffices? I can just tell my company HR to credit salary to the ocbc 360 account? Or need tell them write that description too?,btohqsg
no harm specify  if ur HR entertain such request. But likely they dun,btohqsg
Bonussaver cc got no rewards lol,btohqsg
Anyone here  i recently applied SC smart thru SingSaver  i think the promotion is to spend ($250) to get the rewards. Wondering if I'll be eligible for this too (SC website) if i spend total $588?,btohqsg
Maybank app getting worse ü§ÆFirst they disabled PayNow on the app  now they blocked access for developer mode enabled devices. People who work as app developer no need do banking? ü§Æ,btohqsg
Hi guys I am new to the group and please let me know if I am not supposed to ask questions like this and I will delete it immediately.Would like to seek for your advice.I have around 12.5k stuck inside the Singapore saving bond giving interest 3.21% and 3.47% respectively for 10 years. I realise I missed a lot of other benefits after watching some honey money YouTube video.Can anyone advise if I should redeem it and put it somewhere else? Or I should continue keeping it.Thanks,btohqsg
Off developer when nedd to use on back when u don't needs,btohqsg
Interest rate is trending downward so if i were u will keep the money in there,btohqsg
What benefits have u missed out that's worth more than your SSB?,btohqsg
Ya  I second this‚Ä¶ what benefits? I think not bad,btohqsg
I also resisting e temptation to redeem SSB and put in (another) high yield saving account or dividend paying investments.,btohqsg
SSB is a longer term play where you bet savings interest rates or something close to risk free  will drop below what SSB has promised you for 10 years.,btohqsg
luckily my starhub online payment from 25th is now posted  so the posting is not early of the day,btohqsg
They want post morning or afternoon is up to their discretion..,btohqsg
Hi. I have deposited $2K  registered for the EGA Bonus Interest Promotion and performed 5 FAST transfers to other banks. How do I know if I'm qualified to receive the Bonus Interest ie. Will they send a SMS or something?,btohqsg
Yes they will sent a sms. But it took awhile to receive,btohqsg
I guess something like Moomoo‚Äôs cash plus  those saving account like scb uob one etc.,btohqsg
