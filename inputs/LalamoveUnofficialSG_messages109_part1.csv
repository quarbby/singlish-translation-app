4 places in the east and back to woodlands again,btohqsg
HAHAH i saw this also. Order still thereü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
It's really not easy still have to deliver the goods to the door step,btohqsg
Looking for urgent driver able to drive 10ft lorry . Delivery of chocolate . Able to start tomorrow. $10/location diesel and rental under own expenses .,btohqsg
lj book under bike then not applicable for bike,btohqsg
LJ drivers condone this type of LJ customers  they accept it and allow it to happen...that's why la,btohqsg
we have staff that will tag along with u to assist in delivery. Round trip to send her back.,btohqsg
This one really pro sia. Delivery people and send back somemore,btohqsg
I think it's getting more n more now. Prob cos there have been drivers who have been accepting these jobs. So more n more pple r trying their luck. Word will spread ard,btohqsg
And don't even think abt hoping lalamove will ban or stop these customers  cos lalamove is making money from them,btohqsg
We always wondering price so low etc  but always see the jobs will eventually be taken. So means out there still have alot of pple will take the jobs lor. Cannot underestimate the neediness of those who really need to make the money  be it for the families or what. Customers also know this  so they will keep taking advantage,btohqsg
Everyone have their own difficulties bah,btohqsg
Rather we shld b condoning these smelly customers instead  who take advantage of desperate drivers  but again llm won't do anytg to them cos they r the ones giving llm bizü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I always tell them politely that I am not a Private Hire car so legally no license to ferry human especially in the event of an accident  claim will be rejected. If u are not polite  they will give you bad rating and then Lalamove will need to explain. So damn waste of time and stupid! Am moving on to do Private Hire after driving for 7 solid months. Getting demotivated ‚òπÔ∏è.,btohqsg
Yeah the prices are really low sometimes,btohqsg
PHV prices also sucky. unless weekends  pH or raining day.,btohqsg
Yah  there is always the fear they will give bad rating etc if we reject them or anytg. That's y I jdb n don't take those jobs,btohqsg
llm can stack one shot earn50- 60+  but phv cannot stack passenger. haha,btohqsg
Actually if they don't put a return trip sign there  or another drop in the job showing the end location  there's no obligation for us to do it. If they want to they shld add the drop in or the return trip charge,btohqsg
If they write in comments  u have the right to tell them add the return drop charge or additional drop n mileage fee,btohqsg
by right cannot ferry passenger along. if halfway accident then tua ki liao,btohqsg
Then those who take the job better ask for the additional fees,btohqsg
passenger play dirty sue the driver worst....,btohqsg
This 1 is cfm cannot 1,btohqsg
They don't dare reject or cancel the job after getting it. Cancel kena suspension. Reject later kena bad rating. Or they just really need to make the money bah,btohqsg
How do you guys stack orders?,btohqsg
Like I said  it's all the bad customers who r responsible for all these shit. Take advantage of those who need to earn the money,btohqsg
Yes I always stack minimum 2 for peak hours and maximum 5. But lately very tough exclude (special occasions like last weekend). Need to take schedule jobs but need to keep looking at the app. Too long hours spent. I am doing this PT and only on weekends. Able to earn at $200 nett per day but this job is tougher than PH. I should be able to earn more doing PH for the same amount of hours put in.,btohqsg
this is where llm put their driver in a dilemma situation. llm sucks. lol,btohqsg
me too.. slowly I realize bo hua. haha.,btohqsg
waaa u still will go park in CP ah. lol. I never do that.,btohqsg
have to stack. no stack how to earn. llm always don't let us stack but the prob is with the rising petrol price... have they ever spare a thought for us? NO LO.. they only wanna earn their comm n shake leg while we suffer,btohqsg
LLM is still the best among the delivery apps but still lose out to PH. I started with PH as I do not like to transport people.,btohqsg
Agree the price is still highest if I'm not wrong. Just that can't stack too many n that jobs have to bid,btohqsg
N of cos the back end support is very bad,btohqsg
Price:Base fare $12 (under 1km) + $1/km (first 3km) + $0.45/kmAdditional stop charge:+$5Weight limit:20 kgSize limit (L √ó W √ó H):70 √ó 50 √ó 50 cmAdditional services:-,btohqsg
I die die won't accept passengers. The consequences if anytg were to happen is too much to handle,btohqsg
If its ferry passenger  I will reject. If llm suspend me  I will write in email say I'm not phv  against law to ferry. If they still suspend  tell them send email to authorities etc,btohqsg
See whether they still dare suspend,btohqsg
Weight limit 20kg. The stuff I delivery yesterday confirm more than 20kg liao,btohqsg
Llm will bully if they see we don't dare don't dare. I no scared this 1. If I'm not in the wrong I will fight to the end. But if the comments of the job got write need bring passenger I won't take it. Or else they later say comments write liao who ask me take the job,btohqsg
if play law with llm they sure scare . lol,btohqsg
If live chat with LLM CS they will ask you to bring a weighing scale. I told them why don‚Äôt you try out this job yourself. Talk is easy.,btohqsg
Yah there r jobs whereby they nvr write. If I kena I will just tell them either u give me trolley use  or u get pple help me. Cos its their fault nvr write need trolley. I will take all photos. If they no trolley no pple help I will just tell them I can't do it.,btohqsg
aiya llm also bullshit. u fuck the CS then they say will ban and remove u. end up also can do again. lol,btohqsg
that day I took a job at factory area .. total weight over 30kg+,btohqsg
Sometimes we cannot blame the guards. They have their own set of rules to follow from building management,btohqsg
knn the user should book a van or lorry la. why book car,btohqsg
furthermore never state need trolley or anything. remarks is blank. how we know what to expect,btohqsg
No helper no trolley then I just reject lor. They want complain I can back it up with photos etc.,btohqsg
