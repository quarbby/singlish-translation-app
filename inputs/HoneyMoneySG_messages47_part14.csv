no another deduction and may incur giro failure fee  need to pay cc manually.,btohqsg
Do u know if u can use multiple cards to achieve the spending requirement? For example $100 I use the uob one debit card and the other $400 I use uob evol card,btohqsg
Not sure. Pls CX with bank.I am planning to use uob one card and uob one supplyment card with my wife so spending together will sure hit $500,btohqsg
Yes as long as it is under list of eligible card,btohqsg
Why do that? Just use all EVOL for more rebate by spend $600,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how will the interest for OCBC 360 be calculated? E.g If I just recently open an account and deposit $ in today  will i get the full 3%+ interest for the month (Letâ€™s say i hit salary credit  save  spend category) ?,btohqsg
So letâ€™s say i place a larger sum  will be able to average out to at least $500 through the month.,btohqsg
Yeah. If letâ€™s say i place $20k today for example.,btohqsg
Hey guysFor hospital bill (SGH) which card is best to use? Ct scan.I got :Uob platinum visaUob signature visaCiti rewards + amazeHSBC revolution?,btohqsg
Will i still be entitled to the full monthâ€™s interest? Which is (3%+ * $20k) / 12,btohqsg
It will still be average out for the month ah (1 of 31 day)  no matter what  that why i say count daily  credit monthly,btohqsg
Just Curios- Can CPF payout prata? Early May23 was notified that i can draw up to $1124 for payout  or extend drawout to 70  failing to set instuction will automatically extend to drawout at 70. As the number 1124( like cursing me everyday die easily) so i changed to $1118 to reflect a change. Mid May23  CPF transferred $1118 as per instruction to designated account. Today received a mail stating that the payout is $1109. Can CPF suka suka change payment instruction ?,btohqsg
Citireward plus amaze via healthhub (up to 1k bill) can spilt bill according to other,btohqsg
average daily balance is $20k/31interest earned $20k/31*31/365Ã—x%,btohqsg
I have already max out my monthly 1k spend â€¦,btohqsg
Healthhub dont chase u so fast to pay de,btohqsg
use dbs wwmc or citi rewards via healthhub,btohqsg
Yes for new statement cycle  he dont have dbs wwmc Trazora,btohqsg
I have actually forgot to mention ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
And dbs dont think included heath hub,btohqsg
Anyone tries receive money from China,btohqsg
Please be clearer in questions  money from bank  alipay  or what?,btohqsg
How do you add your bank card to wechat if you are not  China user ?,btohqsg
If paying with city + amaze . Does this mean I have to key it the amaze card number ?,btohqsg
actually which bonus interest categories u fulfilled? Likely only save cat for 1.2%?,btohqsg
Cant for wechat  but sgporean can open alipay to receive rmb,btohqsg
actually if using healthhub can use citi rewards card directly,btohqsg
Confirm yeah? I rather use wwmc,btohqsg
According to mileslion dbs wwmc not there for miles csdd for hospital bill  better to call dbs to double check if it was me. Dbs can be quite strict on rewards awards according to my experience.,btohqsg
healthhub is mcc 8099 not mcc 8062,btohqsg
Have u use dbs before on healthhub?,btohqsg
Then if test then go ahead.,btohqsg
However  do rmb now got amaze 4 percent cashback on amaze wallet spend  think that is a better offset if not miles chaser  cold hard cash rebate,btohqsg
but need to pay multiple $125 on healthhub.For cashback can use citi smrt  uob evo  dbs lf etc via healthhub,btohqsg
Hi if i deposit a 10k cheque before 3pm to ocbc bank do i get interest over the long weekend or no interest from issuing bank and ocbc?,btohqsg
If the healthub bill is more then 500 can do mulitple time  do 4 time get 20 off set it immediately then next bill so why not,btohqsg
Cheque need to be clear by bank lah,btohqsg
Reflect in acct then will earn interest,btohqsg
Ledger balance but not available will not earn right,btohqsg
Cause Iâ€™m going to kl tmr  then intending to use the debit card with amaze to clock in the required spending also.,btohqsg
Need convert SGD. Also need wait 2 working day after selling and converting,btohqsg
Uob debit is mastercard? Mine is visa,btohqsg
hihi anyone knows if hsbc revo bonus points monthly cap is based on date of posting or transaction?,btohqsg
Hihi sorry another noob question on amaze. If I pair it with my standard chartered unlimited credit card is it worst off then pair it with Citibank credit card?,btohqsg
1.5% rebate only  citi rewards or citi cashback card better,btohqsg
actually using uob evol or uob one card may be better even if incur 3.25% fx fee  given Amaze markup the exchange rate,btohqsg
Iâ€™ll be scared to pair amaze with debit  so just be cautious,btohqsg
Agree since you already have uob EVOL  the 6.77% is > 3.25% fee,btohqsg
I see  thanks all for ur inputs. Will use the evol card for expenses there then ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Better donâ€™t call bank. Later kena nerf.,btohqsg
