but why u microwave veggie for 3 min,btohqsg
how long should it be then,btohqsg
Or u put 1 min firdt,btohqsg
3 mins can get very hot. Vege contains a lot of water,btohqsg
but yes i was planning to have just veggies for dinner,btohqsg
Uhhhhhh do u have anything else?,btohqsg
Where can I find free jc notes,btohqsg
but if u ask my honest opinion  it's probably good to start with,btohqsg
Thanks for all of ur input,btohqsg
Thank god i dont take physicd,btohqsg
Lmao i thought ur course need rush evrything,btohqsg
Google for Resnick and Halliday for physics textbook,btohqsg
University level. It's what brought me my A,btohqsg
do half tday half tmr HAHAH,btohqsg
Btw alvls starting next week alr,btohqsg
And i havemt rly revised physics,btohqsg
really depends on your confidence level,btohqsg
Ye can do well  im still looking for summary notes,btohqsg
when I was A level  I didn't really revise for maths and physics too,btohqsg
I don't rmb asking this but does it matter what sub combi do students take if they're aiming to get into med. If I take phy/chem do I need to self study bio,btohqsg
both have equal chances. Bio may give u a smaller advantage but physics open more doors in case u dont get into medicine,btohqsg
A lvl subject is at least 5X as much as O lvl subject,btohqsg
Erm the jump for physics is like...double to triple,btohqsg
A lvl Phy is so much easier nowadays compared to 20 yrs ago,btohqsg
i regret taking f math instead of physics im dying very hard in freshmore physics now lol,btohqsg
ok la. Different paths for different people,btohqsg
Should have taken F maths and Physics both,btohqsg
wasnt expecting to go engineering tho only because only sutd accepted me while i got rejected by the other unis,btohqsg
Uni Physics - go youtube search Walter Lewin and watch his lectures,btohqsg
general currently learning gauss law ampere law and biot savart law,btohqsg
Uni level Physics or if u join JC Physics Olympiad,btohqsg
Used to train some JCs for that,btohqsg
I learned this in JC for competition. Wasn't that tough for a JC kid,btohqsg
For Gauss and Ampere law  questions are generally related to symmetry  so it's not that bad,btohqsg
Gauss and Ampere law are shortcuts for special situations instead of applying Coulomb and Biot-Savart law,btohqsg
Uncle think Elliot Anderson is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
But 20years ago didnt have pw and opposing subject,btohqsg

Ok la if u know the CCAs,btohqsg
when not main CCA like chess club  I only go for school training and not external training as it clashes with the main CCA,btohqsg
