in the grand scheme of things  it's notthathigh  but it's a hefty sum for one or two people to be tanking. unfortunately can't reveal specifics,btohqsg
we're always looking for ways to become more cost efficient though  and being registered with the govt has alr helped with that quite a bit,btohqsg

Ig I was lucky during o's,btohqsg
Stalin came out last yr for essay,btohqsg

i asked my friend what they spoke and she was like ‚Äúuhh brazilian?‚Äù,btohqsg
Yo fun fact did you know that when the portuguese colonised malacca a whole new creole was formed.,btohqsg
i do know of people that speak malayo-portuguese creole aka kristang,btohqsg
Bahasa Malaysia is the politically correct term,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite cool in malaysia actually,btohqsg

damn you almost got me going down a rabbit hole,btohqsg
Can i ask a moral question,btohqsg
So i went for a korean trial class,btohqsg
"I really enjoyed myself there and I was thinking $285 was a great deal for 8 lessons with textbooks included. Dad and grandma agreed and gave me $300 for class fees. I wanted my mum's blessing but she was like ""why don't you go learn Excel or sth else that you'll def use in the workplace instead of a language you'll lose if you don't practice it""",btohqsg
so what do i do with my $300 now?,btohqsg
how is this a moral question,btohqsg
i dont wanna let my mum down,btohqsg
but im kinda sick of the whole asian parent trope she has,btohqsg
"""from the moment you chose bio over math in jc u fked up""""why are you not interested in something like tech or biz? are you scared of competing with others?""""why are you so insistent on social service/healthcare? only with money can you help others""",btohqsg
imo  she has a point  but at the same time  you should pursue what interests you. You could still learn Excel on the side. You dont need to pay $300 for an excel course that you can just learn from youtube,btohqsg
ya i wanted to tell her my school has free linkedin learning so i dont need to spend $300 to learn excel,btohqsg
she just wants you to have in demand skills la,btohqsg
