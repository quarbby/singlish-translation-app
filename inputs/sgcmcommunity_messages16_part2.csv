so hopefully nobody wants. in fact if below 100k used 5 years a veloce can be had. it is good deal,btohqsg
let the mainstream stick with the germans,btohqsg
i dont seek popular opinions when i buy car. i buy what i like.,btohqsg
like my GFS said women who duno cars see AR aso know it's a branded beautiful car,btohqsg
