P=hpgupthrust formulasremoved.But tricky thing... removed doesn't mean it won't be tested. Exams frequently gives the formulas in the question and expect students to still solve it,btohqsg
for J1s  continuation of idea of energy stores from O levelMajor rearrangement of concept flow. That's about it,btohqsg
Are you sure H2 Maths has not tested Poisson distribution before?In fact  t-distribution appeared in H2 Mathematics before.,btohqsg
Not now uh  I.e. they removed it from h2 Math,btohqsg
Can check seab syllabus for 2026 for more info,btohqsg

I want to ask the holy grail operator questions   what materials requirements qualify for uploads and display in grail  ?,btohqsg
Is there a guide of sort ?,btohqsg
H2 Math did not test Poisson distribution at all,btohqsg
The only distributions they taught us were Normal and Binomial,btohqsg
Hello  how does NS disruption work? I have an offer for SMU Computing and Law. I enlisted in 2024 Jan batch. But I really want to siam my remaining foreign exercises LOL.(+) I save 1 year(-) no post-NS 9 month break(-) have to spend my first year holiday in NS(+) probably doing other stuff because my unit is going defunct,btohqsg
Btw I did sec 5 and MI so I incurred 2 years of studying vs an IP/express student who did A Levels/IB too! So I have this pressure to keep up lol,btohqsg
Oh a fellow sec 5 and MI student,btohqsg
Great to see you actually did well enough to get a double degree in SMU,btohqsg
Most MI students dont even qualify for a degree,btohqsg
Sigh I feel that I have to keep up in this rat race,btohqsg
but I just fundamentally want to Siam my upcoming foreign exercises LOL,btohqsg
stupid nga they want me to sail during NDP,btohqsg
technically have seen someone do that if he had 1 yr and 10 mnths of NS,btohqsg
Im not sure how long before uni they allow you to disrupt though,btohqsg
Im sure theres a set duration,btohqsg
havent seen someone do that for 2 years of ns tho,btohqsg
I am pes B1 and I did tekong BMT haha,btohqsg
But he need serve his 3 months back some time,btohqsg
Doesnt have to be 1st year uni holiday,btohqsg
Even after graduate you can serve,btohqsg
Speaking of MI I want ask sth since they are unique in 3 year a levels course so 1. Will conventional jc materials work for them? 2. Is it an advantage or disadvantage given 3 years of course  like one year more time?,btohqsg
Nah Idw to wait to finish my NS liability so long  NS is a fking liability,btohqsg
1) work or not  they still gotta go through it. But success stories are a few only2) on paper its an advantage  real results wise we are no better than yijc,btohqsg
tbh i forgot much about my nsf asa stuff alr,btohqsg
It really depends on how soon you wanna disrupt,btohqsg
1. Yes itâ€™s still a lvls2. Up to you  it was an advantage for me because I didnâ€™t study O Level Literature  I really donâ€™t know how to do literature in my y1 of MI  plus it was my H2,btohqsg
And I was getting used to the difficulty of H2 geography and econs,btohqsg
Back in my year  only 50% of A level students got >67.5 for As,btohqsg
I wasnt even in the 50% btw lmao,btohqsg
^closest wld be this  mostly for those who serving for 1 year and 10 mnths of ns,btohqsg
Yaa i remember its 1 week before sch starts,btohqsg
i feel like there is some missing info,btohqsg
The 3 year programme gave me more time to condition myself for the A level workload from a sec 5 workload  even tho we do only 3 H2s and GP in our graduation year which is honestly quite noob vs those who did 4h2s  h3s etc in JC lol,btohqsg
i have heard some mi ppl talk to me before abt how some of their classmate retain but idk what is the percentage,btohqsg
As far as i remember  retain rate was like 50% per year for me lmao,btohqsg
Each year the class gets cut in half,btohqsg
i think the mi principal did change some stuff about the promotion criteria,btohqsg
like cannot get S or smth like that,btohqsg
