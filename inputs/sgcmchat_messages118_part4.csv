siala i just open the chat,btohqsg
org sblh cm nk tutup hidung,btohqsg
lower a little more then yum,btohqsg
too lazy to mod in AC,btohqsg
i cant find my stock is best sticker fuck,btohqsg
as a Mugen enthusiast i disagree,btohqsg
the livery isn't my cup of tea,btohqsg
they do make some cool stuff,btohqsg
do u need me to help u take pics,btohqsg
okay I talking about white spoon kitted cars not the livery,btohqsg
their kits all oem++  not too crazy,btohqsg
there is a fine line between overdone and just nice imo,btohqsg
i like the msia spoon r34,btohqsg
sometimes a sticker can fuck the whole build up,btohqsg
imo don't do permanent mods that results in you not being able to revert back to stock,btohqsg
i think they're nice but they do need to fit the theme,btohqsg
i am not a huge fan of car club stickers on a car?,btohqsg
a wrong windshield banner can make the whole buildlook wack,btohqsg
okay but some of them are nice,btohqsg
but stickers from the OEMs that you have parts mounted on the build is cool,btohqsg
this one needs to get banned or smt pls,btohqsg
basically anything that can be slapped on a hiace with TE37s,btohqsg
I think the sportsmind one is the worst,btohqsg
i've seen TRD and sportsmind ones on an Audi A4,btohqsg
