The Lop Nur National Wild Camel Nature Reserve  which covers an area of 26 000 square miles  is extremely dangerous to enter during the summer months as surface temperatures can reach up to 80C. Cars can easily get stuck in the loose sand and without proper equipment and large food and water supplies  it can quickly turn into a deadly experience.,btohqsg

Wah whose evo crash at OG last night,btohqsg
Evo is scary at high speed   but in sg not worth speeding sia  so many humps and traffic,btohqsg
it was sideswiped by a white cullinan. hit and run.,btohqsg
think dashcam didnt capture the plate either.,btohqsg
To go thru the bollard the evo also must be travelling at speed one,btohqsg
not on my end at least.,btohqsg
yeah. i feel that the evo was travelling at speed  RR didn't check blindspot and merged.,btohqsg
But when travelling at speed and at night  very easy to misjudge distance,btohqsg
the bigger the car  the smaller the_,btohqsg
So i wouldnt say the evo is faultless LOL,btohqsg
boils down to how TP deem it lor,btohqsg
was just about to mention that.,btohqsg
but only the people in the cars involved know what happened,btohqsg
Even vios is fun to drive,btohqsg
Even 7 seater also fun to drive,btohqsg
