When u take the test  your assessor is king,btohqsg
If the assessor lenient then liddat lorh,btohqsg
no..but you see the kind of roads i passed by for nearly 11 years,btohqsg
i can judge if a road is good for drivers or not,btohqsg
eunos..has some of the complicated roads  you will ever drive on,btohqsg
i a bit confused‚Ä¶u r saying the vehicles need to stop before the zebra crossing to see if there are vehicles on the main rd ah,btohqsg
These two vehicles are stopped at the correct place,btohqsg
that motorcycle is doing something dangerous,btohqsg
you can see  the blue motor is about to cut infront of the sienta when the coast is clear,btohqsg
Worse intersection in Eunos  all the diff coloured lines show where each driver could potentially go...all have traffic lights,btohqsg
Its so bad  when you see this picture...you have no idea who has the greenlight,btohqsg
This picture will speak for itself  Guess which direction you cant go from this intersection,btohqsg
yup because if a car was here...you have no idea where its going. It also crosses the intersection when its clear,btohqsg
either direction it moves...you basically cant move anywhere except turning left,btohqsg
Then i thought the traffic lights should be programmed in a way that at any one time no paths should intersect,btohqsg
the purple car has no traffic lights to follow,btohqsg
haha then if it‚Äôs green light with no arrows you can either go straight or turn right if it is safe,btohqsg
The blue light..maybe?  the yellow light is useless,btohqsg
cause the traffic lights are too close together?,btohqsg
i mean  just look at the delusional lights you are seeing,btohqsg
GG  tdy my friend learnt he has a Hidden Mod,btohqsg
hellooooo anyone received ts code n  going to ts concertt? i need help buying tix üôè ü§≤,btohqsg

No you‚Äôre the guy whos get turns on by accident,btohqsg
Not even surprised if thats a real bus in malaysia,btohqsg
If I get any tickets i wld probs scalp them so its better if I dont get my grubby hands on em,btohqsg
Tbh  ts tickets not worth esp the vip ones . Its just to let the singer and her crew earn the money only .,btohqsg
I need them on WhatsApp pls,btohqsg
Scalping is the worst type of investment I've ever seen,btohqsg
Even if you can get high returns,btohqsg
No one going to buy 10k,btohqsg
The diff is that the items have abundant availability even if you bulk purchase,btohqsg
Scalping takes away things that are in high demand,btohqsg
A legal form is called flipping,btohqsg
You buy a damage product fix it to look presentable then sell it as a new product,btohqsg
Manufactured it cheap from china sell to US,btohqsg
can't wait for C151 themed busses,btohqsg
Is honkai SR meant to succeed genshin?,btohqsg
I never touch genshin  only HSR at the beginning and then I had other interests,btohqsg
man i used to be so overyhyped for the game for a year,btohqsg
when it released i played for 3 days and never touched it again,btohqsg

rem jp va will be va fyi,btohqsg

its only those people who r unlucky as fk  that get nothing will stay for long in the game,btohqsg
but those that get 10 5 stars in 1 pull will say (yea this game mid) and leave,btohqsg
