For the bonus 1% on HSBC EGA  does it start from the time I receive the SMS or is it backdated to when I transferred in 2K into the account?,btohqsg
then cannot empty the account in Mar. Need another uob account or just skip the next promo (if any),btohqsg
start from next day after u fulfilled the $2k in and 5 transactions in the first month. Subsequent month will continue get the 1% if u already fulfilled the requirements in previous month,btohqsg
May I ask what is the best credit card for travel bookings such as travel agencies  airline / hotel bookings?,btohqsg
My 5 transactions already completed  but still not posted yet. Duno why Mrt and bus takes so long.,btohqsg
as in u using hsbc cc to clock 5 transactions? why not just do 5 FAST to other bank?,btohqsg
I didn't expect the posting to take so long. Next month will do 5 FAST to other bank,btohqsg
HSBC advance is visa. Waited about 4 days,btohqsg
should be posted today or tomorrow. btw u need 5 days of bus/mrt to clock 5 transactions. Easier to just do 5 FAST to other banks.,btohqsg
Hi all  I applied for ssb of around 10k on 01 Dec 2022 at an interest rate of 3.33% pa. I made an early withdrawal on 01 Feb 24 (around 427 days) . According to my interest calculation  I should receive around $390 in interest (10000*427/365*3.33%)  however the accrued interest amount credited back to my account is only $55. Can anyone advise this?,btohqsg
Yup I just realised that too! At first I thought one bus trip is counted as one transaction. After that then found out they lump one day of travel into one transaction. Faints,btohqsg
Hi guys. With Trust credit card now at 0.5% cashback on all purchases (in the form of Linkpoints)  is it more worth to use Trust credit card overseas vs Instarem Amaze? I know that there's a video comparing both but wanted to get your opinions,btohqsg
Hello  I have not heard much from Chocolate Finance very recent months. Can I hear the reviews before I trsf my funds pls?,btohqsg
depends how much u get from instarem Amaze,btohqsg
How does the rising dragon promo work? How do they determine if it’s incremental funds?,btohqsg
They compare it with your balance as at 31 Dec 2023,btohqsg
I see…so essentially there is a reference month,btohqsg
You earned $10000 × 3.33% ÷12mths x 2mths is $55.50,btohqsg
the 2023 interest should have been paid into your bank account already no?,btohqsg
both quite comparable in terms of rates  I think Trust card is better cos it is credit card  easier to do holding charge etc,btohqsg
Hi guys   is there any interesting invitation code for simplygo ?,btohqsg
My bad  didn't see the credit from cdp in 2023. Thanks!,btohqsg
been seeing a lot of such scam to try to phish your telegram login and password..but telegram needs 2FA right? what is the use of just login and password?,btohqsg
Gurus  I have a questions what is the min sum to deposit in money market fund  and can I top up every month? Or need one lump sum to invest?,btohqsg
most should be MINIMUM $500 or $1000 only.,btohqsg
Which fund and which platform exactly? It varies widely,btohqsg
Fullerton sg funds using moomoo recommend by honeymarket,btohqsg
And what if I do not have this card?,btohqsg
Then either you apply  or tell us what cards you have mah,btohqsg
Are u referring to the competitive application at cut-off?,btohqsg
how it works is..everyone who bidded competitive BELOW 3.80% (even 0.01% below) will get FULL ALLOCATION at 3.80%only those who bidded exactly at 3.80% will get 9% allocation.For this auction.. non competitive all got 100% allocation at 3.80%,btohqsg
I start using amaze recently and I did comparison paying oversee with amaze and also direct card.,btohqsg
Seem amaze rate is not as good as paying direct card,btohqsg
There would be additional charges isn't it?,btohqsg
In this case  why would pple want to use amaze when their rate is no better than direct card ?,btohqsg
The rate is almost similar to money market fund like Fullerton SGD Cash Fund,btohqsg
its doesn;t have additional charge. and theiir rates SHOULD be better than banks.,btohqsg
But based on what I paid yesterday with amaze  and uob card directly  uob gives better rate,btohqsg
The home amount is posted already? If not  did you add in the 3.25% charge?The posted transaction will then confirm the exchange rate and show the final amount with fees.,btohqsg
From uob app  both txn from amaze and direct uob shown as pending,btohqsg
OK  let me check again tomorrow when they get posted,btohqsg
Amaze converted to sgd amount is fixed already  whether posted or not. The one for UOB is the one you have to check again.,btohqsg
Hi guys Is there a video by Chris on recent Moo Moo 6.8% guaranteed returns promotion?I remember watching it but now cannot find…,btohqsg
Which card u paired with Amaze?,btohqsg
I paired amaze with uob lady,btohqsg
I'm also checking out trust card on what's their rate for HKD to SGD too,btohqsg
For paying directly with credit card  processing time may take up to 3 working days. High chance there is a 3%+ CC charge,btohqsg
Rate similar to Youtrip  sometimes lower than Youtrip abit but not alot unless u spending is high,btohqsg
Is there a closing date for this promotion?,btohqsg
Have you included the additional fees that bank charges?,btohqsg
