What use is knowledge if not to flex,btohqsg
What use is knowledge if not to flex,btohqsg
Cuz I have the buttons lol,btohqsg
Eh how to create group stickers ah?,btohqsg
You make a group and a sticker pack  then you can set the group sticker pack,btohqsg
Okay you can add stickers into a group using the group settings,btohqsg
But it must have at least 100 participants,btohqsg
Starts adding bots to increase the number,btohqsg
Must it be a public group?,btohqsg
AKSLSKSJCKWODJVKD I STILL NEED 19 MEMBERS,btohqsg
Mfw i remember my stickerpack was the unofficial grp pack,btohqsg
Yeah! This pack is way more developed,btohqsg
Maybe our resident memer should make more of them,btohqsg
Thats why i have 0 followings on instagram,btohqsg
Leaving and rejoining messes up my work,btohqsg
Cuz I hate the pop up asking you to follow people,btohqsg
It's because you are sweaty that's why you should exercise,btohqsg
Gives you an excuse to bathe afterwards,btohqsg
U can actually set up a counter for it,btohqsg
Jung hon used the bao sticker pack!,btohqsg
Now I just need john smith to use it,btohqsg
You can't call me out now,btohqsg
Unlike in the stupid math group,btohqsg
I don't understand why Kueh hasn't demoted you,btohqsg
Why isnt there a bio group,btohqsg
Cos bio isn't as kool as maths,btohqsg
I actually have quite a bunch of things to clear tmr,btohqsg
Can i be a kool kid,btohqsg
Does the sun rise from the west?,btohqsg

Whatever that im selling to u,btohqsg
And did you just make your dp visible again,btohqsg
If ure in this grp u cant see it,btohqsg
If ure in other groups as me u can,btohqsg
Thats why it glitches for people in multiple groups,btohqsg
I have to ban you then,btohqsg
But the only other groups are the study groups though,btohqsg
U cant ban someone who had already been bannd’nt,btohqsg
Bovine spongiform enthalpy. Cannot remember the term but here is your dosage of ptsd!,btohqsg
U didnt see the post uh,btohqsg
Math majors are also safe because they were never employed,btohqsg
Thats why u need to take it with LIT as double majors,btohqsg
So u can ensure that u cover two areas,btohqsg
This is something straight outta chemguru memes,btohqsg
Just kidding  it is not fun.,btohqsg
/Combotstats on how many times has this been forwarded,btohqsg
I feel very tempted to do smth,btohqsg
I see no wonder u forgot to exclude the original from 166,btohqsg
You have a future in optimisation,btohqsg
To find out more  apply to Major in applied maths !,btohqsg
It depends on the university of your choice,btohqsg
What if i dont have a choice,btohqsg
Apply to do maths in an applied sense,btohqsg
Then u r not my target audience,btohqsg
Apply to apply maths in real life,btohqsg
Wow  doing mathematics in university  what a nerd.,btohqsg
If u ever need a portfolio,btohqsg
Imagine John being a buff bodybuilder pushing people out of the way,btohqsg
All buff body builders are actually nice people,btohqsg
I would consider myself strong but not buff that is all,btohqsg
Oof that wasn't meant to be a burn,btohqsg
Alright then you are buff to me,btohqsg
Strong as in lifting heavy weights,btohqsg
@junghon3709won a body builder compeititon a few years ago  don't mess with him,btohqsg
I was there at the competition,btohqsg
He can lift weights  but I can lift@chemcer,btohqsg
Chemcer is just a cat in a box,btohqsg
No  he's a tiger in a box,btohqsg
High res mask imposed on a low res cat,btohqsg
Ok la  the strongest is actually my friend  he carried the entire team for Pw,btohqsg
And he was the only A,btohqsg
The rest is B and C,btohqsg
C for pw is really damn sian,btohqsg

Oh yeah apple doesnt have the fingerprint sensor,btohqsg

"It said ""start the day right with a positive mindset although you are tested positive for covid 19""",btohqsg
That's exactly how stable genius Donald Trump thinks,btohqsg

What kind of pre 2017 apple phone r u using ?,btohqsg
If you take this blue pill  you can go back to your normal life,btohqsg
Before you discovered you were time travelling,btohqsg
It’s at a rate of 1 second per second,btohqsg
Every 60 seconds in Africa  a minute passes.,btohqsg
Well  in a way  you are me,btohqsg
Because we are all made up of universe,btohqsg
But u dont have a shadow of intent,btohqsg
I come from a bible verse,btohqsg
But I actually come from a bible verse,btohqsg
I am u u are me,btohqsg
I am he as you as I am as we are all together,btohqsg
I am dying and also being born,btohqsg
I am but a static collection of patterns soon to be undynamic,btohqsg
I dunno why this just occured to me  but I just realised we were both in the same LT for H3 maths lectures at NUS,btohqsg
I dunno why this just occured to me  but i realised we were both in the same school for at least 3 days of my life at a certain JC,btohqsg
I may have even seen you without realising,btohqsg
We did the NUS prof lecture at NYJC,btohqsg
And the NIE guy was at my school,btohqsg
I remember even CJC made it here,btohqsg
NJC was also part of the NYJC one,btohqsg
U must have seen chanric then,btohqsg
If it’s based on geographical proximity  CJC is pretty east,btohqsg
Yes I think that’s what I meant,btohqsg
Then NJC is way more west,btohqsg
But ok that makes more sense,btohqsg
The 2nd set of lectures was a big L coz only the legit east side JCs come to TJC,btohqsg
And yea VJC does their own lessons,btohqsg
Oh wait its at the mjc building,btohqsg
We always suspected HCI and RI weren’t there cause they had their own stuff too  but we didn’t have confirmation,btohqsg
Even if it’s at the TPJC one it’s Tampines,btohqsg
And it’s part of Tampines east MRT,btohqsg
Icic i have never left the comfort of sengkang so idk,btohqsg
But VJC was confirmed to do it on their own anyways,btohqsg
Jurong east is literally west haha,btohqsg
They had to split it east and west coz too big I guess,btohqsg
Or they just ran out of names,btohqsg
But i dont have a car to learn,btohqsg
Any place with Bukit is west alr,btohqsg
I only know bukits in the west,btohqsg
But do they have the batoks,btohqsg
Central-ish but like who tf cares whether central,btohqsg
kaki bukit is in the East,btohqsg
People say east and west xd,btohqsg
Central is not a real area/s,btohqsg
Its in an area that isnt real,btohqsg
In other news  a giant hole with 50km radius has appeared in the middle of Singapore,btohqsg
I accepted CS+math double major for NTU,btohqsg
Not intending to change any more?,btohqsg
See whether NUS wants to even give me CS,btohqsg
This year CS a bit fucked,btohqsg
Have u ever heard 86.25 get ABA,btohqsg
CS bandwagon going ahead at full speed,btohqsg
So CS is almost med/law calibre just that no interview required,btohqsg
My 80 rp friend got rejected from all the courses at NTU,btohqsg
He chose all elite courses isit,btohqsg
Depends on wut he choose mah,btohqsg
Coz now CS confirm must get above 80,btohqsg
All the computing stuff all above 80 one,btohqsg
Even ntu cs is so high now,btohqsg
Getting rejected from CE seond choice,btohqsg
Lol civil he will like straight away get in liao,btohqsg
But yea all at least 80,btohqsg
Ce is about 70 rp bro,btohqsg
CS don’t actually need degree de,btohqsg
All the CE peeps in NTU are NUS CE rejects,btohqsg
Up to u to learn only,btohqsg
And then now NUS CE probably quite high,btohqsg
Show that u not some anarchist,btohqsg
Ok so a majority of people not following rules?,btohqsg
That’s why they need the civilised A Level grads to lead them,btohqsg
Yes we are going to be that group,btohqsg
Chill la ur degree is just one line in cv,btohqsg
Bold of you to assume that A level grads are civilized,btohqsg
Some of them are chaotic evil,btohqsg
But is just one line ma,btohqsg
Ur education is useless once u get a job,btohqsg
Coz people value ur experience more,btohqsg
Degree just something to get u through the door,btohqsg
Can u even sign on lol,btohqsg
I can sign on AFE what,btohqsg
Why tf would I want to be an ME,btohqsg
That’s not the only thing is it,btohqsg
Why u guys want climb the cs bandwagon har,btohqsg
Regardless of race gender language or religion,btohqsg
Jk I dun even want to FASS anyways,btohqsg
Then I not rly like too into science,btohqsg
Only physics interests me a little,btohqsg
It’s like saying chess is a sport,btohqsg
Well it’s just a thing on its own,btohqsg
But nobody would put it under the scientific community,btohqsg
It’s like arguing math is not Philo,btohqsg
Imagine coders being under scientific community,btohqsg
That’s cos they define it as nat sci ma,btohqsg
Same thing for ‘chess is a sport’,btohqsg
Really based on how U define stuff only,btohqsg
What u want to say har,btohqsg
Basically coz screw any courses with chem,btohqsg
Then law is just a big no,btohqsg
So it’s just math or computing or biz,btohqsg
Accounting is fine but not like an exciting thing to do,btohqsg
Just reminds me off how ez POA was,btohqsg
It’s like I can’t imagine myself liking the other courses anyways,btohqsg
I want bandwagon but NUS have too many bandwagon dun want to give me,btohqsg
You jumped off just in time,btohqsg
I accepted NUS CS too for now,btohqsg
I jumped in I’m 2011 when cs isn’t a thing,btohqsg
All my DDP+DMP choices all rejected then plus my CS choice rejected,btohqsg
I remember it was mentioned here that you were going to ICL or something,btohqsg
No la not confirm yet lmao,btohqsg
It’s ok NTU likes me more I Guess,btohqsg
Eh u guys use same pic,btohqsg
Coz they gave me offer on 31 March lol,btohqsg
Anyway it costs a ton and I have a hard time justifying S$300K+,btohqsg
One Russian name one American name,btohqsg
Meanwhile NUS processing until like this Monday,btohqsg
Cuz Oxbridge has a college fee that pushes it to over 100K per year,btohqsg
If u can get into NUS CS I dun see why cannot get scholarship,btohqsg
Oxbridge can read at 70k annual,btohqsg
It’s ok just live with instant noodles,btohqsg
U live normal then 75 Lo,btohqsg
It’s like 7 times as much,btohqsg
(30K tuition fee + 9K college fee + 10K+ living/other fees) × 1.8 = min 90K SGD per yr lmao,btohqsg
The opp cost how much got calculateb4.bo,btohqsg
Yes but u waste 28 years getting those degrees,btohqsg
I live at 70k a year,btohqsg
Unless the bond is something you want,btohqsg
I heard H3 merit= A for Cambridge,btohqsg

International fees and costs | Undergraduate Studyhttps://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/international-students/international-fees-and-costs,btohqsg
How to even do the paper during Vovin,btohqsg
Oh  but you wouldn’t do maths  would you,btohqsg
I am fine with applied math/stats/data science/CS,btohqsg
But no love for any in particular,btohqsg
10k can cover every misc fee there is and more,btohqsg
It’s ok not like it’s illegal,btohqsg
I consider my year only.29k school fees 7k college fees. Lodging at 2.8k a year.,btohqsg
I live there for 24 weeks. Every 4 weeks I spend 100pounds on food max,btohqsg
U.K. food is cheap ass bruh if u cook,btohqsg
Of coz u wanna scrimp u don’t spend so much right,btohqsg
U.K. food at 5 pounds per meal if u eat at school canteen,btohqsg
If u rich sure why not,btohqsg
U want scrimp then u cheapo a bit go cook,btohqsg
Now the fees increase to 32k ok la give or take convert to sgd,btohqsg
Then hols go live at someone else’s house lor if they go back to their home country,btohqsg

your school should have done an info session on this,btohqsg
they did! i think they're gna help for uk apps...but they didn't say much abt Aus ://,btohqsg
and i'm not sure when or how to apply for Aus admission tests etc,btohqsg
bless up thank u !!! would still be willing to hear from someone with personal exp but this is very helpful thank u 😅😅☺️☺️,btohqsg
but usually A level grads go for UK/US,btohqsg
scared i get rejected by everything everywhere,btohqsg
wow can i pm u !!,btohqsg
How I wished I am like@chemcer,btohqsg
Wow must be rich to go Australia uni lol,btohqsg
that or paying in installments would be preferable HAAH,btohqsg
You will be in huge debt after uni tho,btohqsg
Anyways experience will probably be much better than Singapore,btohqsg
i tell myself it's a long term investment 😰😰,btohqsg
Maybe you have to work in Australia or overseas since aussie degree is not well regarded in Singapore job market,btohqsg
ah i see  ok thanks for the advice! :)),btohqsg
hi guys  are these books worth a buy? My sch doesnt provide a lot of notes on GP,btohqsg

Hello does anyone have any clue on contrasting colors ?,btohqsg
This one is definitely more than sufficient,btohqsg
hmm okay thanks everyone who replied,btohqsg
Contrasting colours-There is a contrast in colour,btohqsg
Fr doe i need it for a project,btohqsg
So far i got 2 pairs,btohqsg
Yeah but i use wheel not really visually appealing,btohqsg
There are websites that can help u generate colour palettes based on base colours,btohqsg
Like the red and green im using isnt exactly oppositeRed:#Ff7273Green: 02c6b2,btohqsg
I just use this website for choosing colours,btohqsg
In terms of design u might want to pick a main colour and accent colour  have one dominate over the other and the accent colour is more of a balancing touch,btohqsg
I just wanted to try out stuff w colors,btohqsg
u can try how different colour synergise with each other,btohqsg
it's aimed for mobile devs  but the 5th placeholder is q good to help visualise i think,btohqsg
donate u 1 cent can bo,btohqsg
And I read before if your viral count low enough it won't transmit,btohqsg
Only plus point is you'll most likely be pes F,btohqsg
That’s like raising the good points of Hitler lol,btohqsg
