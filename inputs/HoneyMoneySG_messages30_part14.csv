I already said in earlier msg that my employer have hospitalisation plan for all staff,btohqsg
So the thing about health insurance is that  once you kena anything  it will be hard to get any form of health insurance after that. If you kena anything serious whilst you're still working  the company insurance will pay the initial  medical bills... but what if you can't work anymore and the company eventually has to let you go... this is when you'll need to rely on your personal health insurance.,btohqsg
Do consider the very limited coverage though...,btohqsg
Like I said I used to work in a hospital so I know what kind of coverage I need. If I can opt for C class I would but means tested,btohqsg

There is no right or wrong on using MediShield or buying private integrated insurance.Something you need to consider are:1). Cost2). The service provided. Similar to you want to take budget  economy  business or first class .3). Are you comfortable to stay in a 6-8 bedders class or single room ward.4). Company insurance is not transferrable. Once kena medical board out  you may left with little option.5). Waiting time.6). MediShield got co-pay only.7). Your income status can afford first class status. If not  then opt for budget/economy class. No right no wrong.8)‚Ä¶.You want to to talk to agent or search internet to compare the different and make a decision.Nothing is perfect. Both options are not 100% perfect.,btohqsg

"My personal opinion is that it's easy to dismiss ""needs"" whenever oneself is healthy. If you shift the situation from covering yourself to buying insurance for a loved one  more often than not you'd rather have better coverage as it means saving time and having more treatment options (since rarer or newer treatment options will definitely cost more). Sometimes paying a little extra is worth a little less suffering  but of course your viewpoint is also totally valid too.",btohqsg

Create a video on insurance topic?,btohqsg
I'd let my loved one be their own judge. When I was young I hated being forced by parents to do anything. So why would I force someone to buy insurance if they don't want to. Insurance agents sound like some kind of cult leader trying to convert non-believers,btohqsg
Should also consider ease of claims when choosing a provider.,btohqsg
