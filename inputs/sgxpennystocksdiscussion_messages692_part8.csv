üéâPika World China Review ‚Äì 17 August 2022üéâüçèWalmart: Reasons to be hopeful?üèãThe retail giant reported a reasonable sales and earnings report that hit estimates for the second quarter. This sent shares higher  as earnings of $1.77 per share exceeded the expectation of $1.63.One bright area is guidance. It now expects earnings per share to decline between 9% to 11% for the 2023 fiscal year  which is lower than the previously guided range of 11% to 13%. Optimism rises with such commentary as the company shifts its focus on essentials  and the price cut due to large inventory had already peaked in the last quarter. So the massive damage to the topline and profit margin may be over.üí£Meme Stocks: Bed Bath & Beyond rose sharplyüïπIt was a terrible trading day for Pika World as we expect to incur significant losses with our poor trading set-up on meme stocks  particularly BBBY. Yeah  it is painful. Analysts are calling for the current price to be unreasonable given that the company is facing liquidity issues in an upcoming August 2024 $300 million note.It is a tough week  and we hope to minimize losses and restrain our FOMO sentiments.üì±Lumentum Holdings: An indication of slowing consumer spending?üìâThe company shares fell after the earnings outlook was less rosy than expected. The laser manfaucter guided much lower earnings per share between $1.45 to $1.70 per share  a far cry from Wall Street's estimate of $1.71.The company is strategically growing pain as it looks to finish its acquisition of NeoPhotonics  a laser manufacturer. Likewise  it is on the move to purchase IPG Photonics telecom assets. This will help provide a firmer value proposition in the cloud and networking client group.Pika World will closely monitor the latest data released today for more insights on consumer spending behaviour.üéôWhat's on the menu today?üóΩAt 8.30 pm  we will welcome the Core Retail Sales  and we expect it to decline by 0.1% every month.At 9.30 pm  we expect FOMC member Bowman to speak. Analysts will be looking for clues on any future hike indication.At 2am  we will receive the recent FOMC minutes. It comes after a string of economic data that shows inflation is possibly peaking and moderating; hence  investors may not place immense hope on the minutes. Nonetheless  if any indication of a more aggressive hike is discussed and the Fed seeks to see more cycles of inflation figures before deciding on a rate hike  market movement may be aggressive.It is 17 Aug  Wednesday at 9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week midweek!,btohqsg

Vividthree coming catalyst would be the launch üöÄ of their metaverse NFT related RPG game Sky Ark Chronicles.Based on their website  the launch is 3rd Quarter 2022.

If this game is successful  Vv3 is multibagger without a doubt.Current price RRR $0.042 is huge.Now  let‚Äôs hope the game is a successful one,btohqsg
Vividthree investment in this space   I do like it a lot as I have made tons of money from games too and I like that they are trying to build up the community for skyark chronicles already as there is almost 20k members in that TG group alone.It does shows the early interest and the build up anticipation for this is there too,btohqsg
