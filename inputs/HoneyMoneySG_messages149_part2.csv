Hi guys   can u tell which best credit card overall   ocbc 365 vs uob one ?? . Usuage is bus mrt   food outside   foodpanda  groceries ( Fairprice like that )  taxi(grab)   maybe streaming service,btohqsg
aren't they both bank accounts and not credit cards?,btohqsg
the choice of credit card here will depend on the bank account balance and other details. generally  below 150k  get ocbc 365 account and the card  150k - get uob one account and the card. assuming you are fulfilling other criteria to get max interest.by themselves  the cards are not great,btohqsg
Depends on ur spending too I think UOBone have a min spending of $500 and ocbc365 is $800,btohqsg
My main acc is maybank…so should i deposit in uob acc some of it ?,btohqsg
I may have missed the boat to top up my medisave or has the extra money from the medisave account not been transferred to the OA yet please?,btohqsg
i have made early repayment towards my SCB cards before and the triggered GIRO amount is the reduced payment due amounte.g. $1000 - $100 early (10 days earlier) = $900 GIRO deducted.,btohqsg
You only missed the boat if your employer have contributed to your CPF.,btohqsg
Last call for Giant supermarket with CDC vouchers today- yuu Rewards App code OES9FG24,btohqsg
没有最烂，只有更烂(No worst rate  only worser and worser rate),btohqsg
I don't see any contribution but I have hit the target which is weird.,btohqsg
But but but one month contribution also won’t be $4 000 one shot  would it?Plus there will be payments for shield plans n the like.There is always a chance,btohqsg
So I just got this on my human that is on the BTL invite (2.75%+0.05) for January 2025. I’m scared to tap on this message later it registers me for some funny program and invalidates my BTL.(My December ADB is higher than my October ADB which is what BTL benchmarks).Anyone know what this “surprise” is? If anyone dared to click already?,btohqsg
I am thinking was it because the interest for last year was not transferred yet,btohqsg
Idk  if he earns 35k/mth  4k is possible.,btohqsg
I click but don't have anything,btohqsg
But but but there is a cap of $7 400 of contribution. Is it not?,btohqsg
wah lau.. fake notification?!!?!ok thanks for braving it!,btohqsg
Even if that is impossible right as cpf contribution is limited.,btohqsg
The rest won’t attract any CPF contribution right?,btohqsg
Yes. On 31 Dec before interest was it $71500?,btohqsg
So in theory it is not possible to hit the contribution of $4 000 in a single month.Unless of course he has multiple jobs n all jobs contribute the max.,btohqsg
I need to calculate a bit as my old phone doesn't allow me to log in to cpf app haha,btohqsg
Uhh  use the app/website. Don't based on own calculation. In any case  should be $71500 if no contributions since 1 Jan till now. Best to check your transactions.,btohqsg
Hi quick question  will using UOB krisflyer  uob ladies card and preferred platinum be a wise choice to pay for wedding expenses? (Eg:hotel venue),btohqsg
most important found out the PAYMENT TERMINAL of the place is what mcc first..,btohqsg
this one actually i also want to askif a person say have 3 jobs.. each earning $8k for example..what is the monthly CPF contribution from employer?employee?CPF ceiling how?,btohqsg
This is assuming we are at 8k salary ceiling for cpf contribution?,btohqsg
sorry i meant the annual CPF contribution ceiling,btohqsg
From this page  multiple employers will need to contribute 17% independently up to salary ceilinghttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/if-i-am-concurrently-employed-by-more-than-one-employer-can-i-choose-to-contribute-cpf-for-one-of-my-employments-only,btohqsg
wow... if i read correctlyEMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION is not cappedemployee contribution CAN be capped (upon application).so technically you can earn EMPLOYER contribution on $24k salary!,btohqsg
(b) There will be no change to the CPF annual salary ceiling of $102 000  which sets the maximum amount of CPF contributions payable for all salaries received in the year  inclusive of both Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages.not sure how the $102k annual ceiling will come into play then... sounds like will be complicated,btohqsg
What else is next without salary or ega,btohqsg
May i know whats the best way to use CC to pay property tax for cashback cards,btohqsg
Hi honey. Anyone using cardup and cc to pay hdb loan?,btohqsg
From what I know it is multiplied by the number of employers you haveSo per employer  it is $37 740 of employer/employee CPF contribution.,btohqsg
If my MA is max out last year. This year by when can I top up before they transfer the excess to the SA ?,btohqsg
Before your company fills up your MA before you do lor.,btohqsg
So is just company contribute deadline  no other hard deadline ? Like interest come in etc,btohqsg
Interest already came in what.. the next time is 11 months later.,btohqsg
Interest already credited n transferred on 31/12 n 1/1,btohqsg
So if max out MA last year. Now the interest come in. Means already cannot top up to MA already?,btohqsg
Refer to your CPF account... BHS is $75500. Topup however much you want till the limit.,btohqsg
If you check your CPF account  you would see a crediting of interest into your MA and a transfer of that interest to either your SA or OA.This is assuming you hit last year BHS of $71 500.,btohqsg
to get the 8K tax rebate for yrself  U can either top up SA ( to FRS) or MA( max BHS) right?,btohqsg
Is this affect everyone? Not in their website and I have not receive any updates in email or app,btohqsg
Any advise on which cb card to use for ntuc learning hub courses pls,btohqsg

And MA  if SA is below 60K,btohqsg
