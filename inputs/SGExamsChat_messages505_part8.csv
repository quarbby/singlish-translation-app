my poly lecturers tell us that we'll graduate from rp knowing how to communicate with others,btohqsg

My friends doing fine in rp but obv doesn't apply to everyone la,btohqsg
worst thing is the teaching method in rp doesnt even suit melike i cant study when everybody is talking because of teamwork,btohqsg
