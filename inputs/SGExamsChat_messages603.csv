text,group
Then we change our handle to YT,btohqsg
I did that in a discord channel before,btohqsg
Then all my friends taught they were talking to someone else,btohqsg
But they were talking to me,btohqsg
Which qn u do for essay ah,btohqsg
U also grad this year right,btohqsg
Ah yeah full of fucking schizos LOL,btohqsg
The way he talks not sane,btohqsg
Actl we arent the only ones some ppl also dl him,btohqsg
I did the qn which no one did,btohqsg
Literally cambridge wrote in their examiners report,btohqsg
Why can't a normal being hold a convo at night?,btohqsg
Less than 100 students attempted this qn,btohqsg
My examples:Micheal Jordan and constant practice after matchMarcus Rashford visiting children's hospitalMessi quitting school to pursue career,btohqsg
"I think alot of people misinterpreted the ""famous for the wrong reasons"" as simply just ""infamous""",btohqsg
The qn was about how sports personalities can make good role models for young people today,btohqsg
Oh but there are people who are famous for doing good things,btohqsg
But ur not supposed to take the phrase figuratively,btohqsg
Ur supposed to take it as literally,btohqsg
The WRONG reason for becoming famous,btohqsg
Young people can learn how to manipulate the referee into giving them yellow card instead of red card,btohqsg
I fucking talked abt parameswara and I don't even know wtf he did,btohqsg
Then I talked abt king Henry the vii and his 6 wives or smth,btohqsg
Hes the former ruler of malacca,btohqsg
Oh ya I forgot you retook gp,btohqsg
does gp help in english paper 1 tbh,btohqsg
Cuz paper 1 in o level is 30m language 10m content,btohqsg
If ur language isn't gd enough,btohqsg
No pt having gd argumentation skills,btohqsg
Look at the o level students this year (josh zl),btohqsg
You have to rlly understand what the qn is asking,btohqsg
Bros only counter to yt was,btohqsg
"""Well at least I'm not retaking a levels""",btohqsg
Ahh I have to scroll up,btohqsg
There was a period of time I got flamed for telling them to like,btohqsg
Why am I not allowed to complain,btohqsg
Skill issue tbh.OP you deserved it since you had TWO YEARS to prepare for A LEVELS and yet you decided to not do anything about it.You didn't study hard enough. You didn't evaluate and improve upon your study methods. You didn't seek help early and go tuition if needed. You didn't attempt to fix your mental health issues (READ: Mental health issues don't exist  it's just in your head and you're simply weak minded). You didn't do many things you could've done. Now just bear the consequences of shitty results.After all  not many people get 85+ RP.To all future JC students:Pls fucking study as hard as you can don't fucking have any fuckshit excuses like mental health (the only time to ever pull that card is in the SAF) and all that friendship problems. Just fucking study smart and hard and ignore everything else you will get 85+ RP trust me.so u don't end up one week before prelims questioning what the fuck have u done for the past year,btohqsg
Ngl the people ik who go psych like,btohqsg
who tf is zl and josh,btohqsg
Lol bro left js because of argumentation skills,btohqsg
They go psych but they also have psych issues they should sort themselves out sia,btohqsg
My friend is going to psych,btohqsg
Despite having very obvious unprocessed ptsd,btohqsg
He has a tendency of trauma dumping on me,btohqsg
When I talk to him abt stuff,btohqsg
Can u imagine that as ur future psychiatrist/psychologist,btohqsg
when I saw 1k on perm,btohqsg
i knew it had something to do with hair,btohqsg
"Hi sir  I want to kill myseld""It's okay I also want to kill myself lemme tell you my backstory...""",btohqsg
Aight a week ltr imma enlist,btohqsg
why yall suddenly talk so much,btohqsg
Ik one tm kid who paramedic,btohqsg
all i did was get dinner,btohqsg
Who the name of the gay guy ah,btohqsg
20g protein and probably 40g oil,btohqsg
Like the principal vice principal lah,btohqsg
All my chers fked off from ej,btohqsg
I rmb got one phy teacher left tm for cj,btohqsg
So far i nvr meet any good boomer cher,btohqsg
Oh not the one who send email one ah,btohqsg
Dam I thought i was the only one 💀,btohqsg
Bro my entire friend group meme abt it,btohqsg
CB now the bus stop crowded as cock,btohqsg
Mentally praying that cca days change will get approved,btohqsg
Plus most of the j1s this year noisy as fk,btohqsg
Idk I only rmb we wear masks that all,btohqsg
Yt u got isax card rite,btohqsg
Imma spam u with random emails,btohqsg
why did this user get flamed for this,btohqsg
ngl the not retaking a levels is like typical teenage boy comeback la,btohqsg
I spend 10 dollar on shopee shit also must think for 3 days,btohqsg
i cant judge cause i didnt do o levels,btohqsg
while i feel like the chem paper this year may be more out of pocket i dont think its as bad as a lot of ppl on reddit make it out to be,btohqsg
Cuz they wanted to complain that cambridge actually has a thing out for 07 kids,btohqsg
And there echo chambering themselves into thinking this is actually true,btohqsg
If u stopped complaining get ur shit tgt and focus on what's next,btohqsg
"Like ""oh if other batches can complain why can't I complain"" like bij that's not the lt",btohqsg
No one complains abt the math paper for like 3 weeks straight man,btohqsg
"""Now we are in the age of technology with telegram so it is obvious that more complaining is present""",btohqsg
Just because u never see anyone complain online last time doesn't mean no one complaint,btohqsg
In fairness when was telegram invented in 2023,btohqsg
Ya but this yr reddit also have,btohqsg
Thas cuz everyone just talks abt it irl,btohqsg
Everyone focuses on the next thing,btohqsg
Should I even bother trying for my remaining subjects if I don't get A1 foe emath,btohqsg
LOL have to wait until 2 years later to see,btohqsg
The thing is 4 years later some 07s in the discord were still harping on about the PSLE semicircle question and the last qn,btohqsg
and ppl will still order 100% sugar,btohqsg
I mean  the semicircle qn wasnt that difficult (i got it correct but a bunch of other careless i think  so no A* T_T),btohqsg
like it may need a bit more thinking,btohqsg
but its not like they put a h2 math qn into a psle paper,btohqsg
It took me a min to realise what 07s mean,btohqsg
yes ppl were still talking about it in discord yesterday LOL,btohqsg
that time i saw liho ady got so the other shops also need the label hmm,btohqsg
liho online got for vv long alr,btohqsg
i don't buy frm the store lol,btohqsg
but then also recently they took out alot of drinks frm the menu,btohqsg
so like rly no point buying alr,btohqsg
I mean tbf they also did use the psle to back up their argument as to why seav hates them,btohqsg
rn my goto is chicha sanchen,btohqsg
tru but the mall i go to the most dont have itea sadge,btohqsg
i was there to see it happen,btohqsg
i'll jump from koi  chicha  liho  playmade,btohqsg
855 msgs in a span of few hours lol  was there drama or smth,btohqsg
TIL the shadow starts at the bendy part,btohqsg
tldr: GP  tmjc life  zl and josh  saf,btohqsg
my attachment ended 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
did 0 NS related shit so,btohqsg
that is totally not josh hutcherson,btohqsg
later 003 appear appear in your dreams,btohqsg
Give him a doll or smth,btohqsg
they dont know how to deal with him,btohqsg
the root cause of the problem,btohqsg
Isn't it mentally taxing or smth,btohqsg
Like it takes a toll on your mental health,btohqsg
I mean I nvr do healthcare before but I did like volunteer shit LOL,btohqsg
All the best kuro kor kor,btohqsg
after a while  u will get used to it,btohqsg
kuro and i in healthcare for very long,btohqsg
"My CCA involves doing volunteer/"" service-learning"" and after every CCA session   we always have a debrief/sharing session",btohqsg
that's a sort of outlet/venting station for us ig,btohqsg
Which part of it is considered venting 😭,btohqsg
When will u be liddat bedok,btohqsg
Jiayous bedok  I pray for the day you'll finally put your big guns to use,btohqsg

Hope y'all brain cells remain intact,btohqsg
i have to wake up at 530am on 2jan,btohqsg
Why does my ocbc 2FA token like iw to access my digital banking then they put my number as +65 65,btohqsg
hi allWe are starting this soon - just sign-up and key in questions if anyone is keen on having questions about university apps / processes / scholarships / early careers answeredCheers and have a good end to the year,btohqsg
what the fuck is wrong with people,btohqsg
her last post about being scared of men also,btohqsg
like im genuinely wondering ah not tryna be mean or what,btohqsg
being mean is just a side benefit,btohqsg
oh is that why i have stomach flu,btohqsg
and she ends up looking 5 years older than she actually does,btohqsg
but really tho id like to hear diff views on this,btohqsg
no i wasnt arrowing anyone specifically ,btohqsg
i wna know if im just being a bitch,btohqsg
Would I lose my brain cells over it,btohqsg
like i admit i can be a bit of a reactionary psychopath,btohqsg
the fact that op is scared of an non sentient physical space just because crimes happened at it,btohqsg
or being scared of a general subset of people (men) just bc she presumably had bad interactions with one,btohqsg
its a little brain dead innit,btohqsg
people keep posting this nonsense on ig,btohqsg
"I just say""Give it back to britan""",btohqsg
but hey at least im getting my starbucks discounts ah,btohqsg
we r going a lil crazy on the starbucks orders,btohqsg
So many ppl queueing for Starbucks ytd,btohqsg
"alot of people actl dgaf about what is happening but just repost stuff to get likes and to kinda show that they're on the ""right"" side of the conflict",btohqsg
ccb 2 weeks me n gf drank it way too much,btohqsg
wait what's happening to Starbucks I noticed we get more points,btohqsg
if people ask me about palestine i straight up just say idk enough to want to comment,btohqsg
they will randomly have 1 for 1s,btohqsg
and in other countries the promos r crazy,btohqsg
i heard some ppl are boycotting starbucks and mcd but idk why,btohqsg
i just went to bali and they had sales on starbies,btohqsg
but dw will come again one,btohqsg
"To be frank I see people ""boycott Starbucks"" but the entire Starbucks is still fill",btohqsg
dude that was me but i saw the amount of antisemitism and got pissed,btohqsg
The same person is probably going to go back to McDonald's a few months later,btohqsg
okay maybe i should use my alt to say this,btohqsg
eh i dont support or condemn either side,btohqsg
i saw a pro palestine protester shouting boycott nike but she was wearing af1s,btohqsg
i js hopr the civilians are safe,btohqsg
we share the same half a braincell rand,btohqsg
I heard its alternative is old Chang kee cafe,btohqsg
the other half of ur braincell is the FA side,btohqsg
but personally I endorse mcdonalds boycott due to the high prices of filet o fish,btohqsg
i boycott it in hopes that they will lower prices(fat chance),btohqsg
anyway for this  silly yes. stupid idk bc this sort of post usually gives half the story only. but like genuine fear not like can snap her out of it by calling it stupid,btohqsg
they need to enlist or some shit eh,btohqsg
im very scared my uni has this kind of acoustic fucks,btohqsg
like it feels drastic to go from what they said happened to fearing every single male on the planet,btohqsg
that's why idk if she's telling the full thing lol,btohqsg
You just finished a level ?,btohqsg
"You remind me of this study on the human brain and the ""fight or flight "" response",btohqsg
the only thing stopping me from doinng a second deg/major related to my interests on the arts side is im scared ill meet the woke idiots,btohqsg
good sir do i look that young,btohqsg
the thing is theres a high chance im sorry,btohqsg
you'll def meet the woke idiots,btohqsg
its just that like liberal arts majors tend to attract A LOT of libleft ppl,btohqsg
some of them can be quite friendly and reasonable,btohqsg
but usually the friendly ones arent as loud as the siao ones,btohqsg
alls fun and games until u get close to someone and u realise theyre woke,btohqsg
then u have to cut them off,btohqsg
i always thought i was a centrist liberal😭,btohqsg
i am but the “centre” is moving far left these days,btohqsg
the extremes at both ends tend to be the loudest,btohqsg
but they arent representative of the majority ppl who may have some views (eg. Support same gender marriage  universal healthcare) but generally dgaf,btohqsg
i wish i cld go back to being political apathetic,btohqsg
but once u get into it u cant get out,btohqsg
just like my poker and drinking addiction,btohqsg
i just try not to think about things as black or white,btohqsg
if not damn easy to get biased,btohqsg
(on a side note if anyone wants to poker pm me i host quite often),btohqsg
I'll give an example that affected majority of us here  me included.It's the change in HDB BTO pricing policy to consider it a discount to surrounding pricesas compared to charging by building costs.,btohqsg
How it affects... Most of you aren't at the stage of working and saving up a retirement nest.Any massive inflation will  for most people 1) delay retirement plans  or2) go back from retired to working because insufficient retirement funds.,btohqsg
But pretty sure that dude isnt 18 yet,btohqsg
Anyways anyone wan buy us stocks please use ibkr,btohqsg
Personally my parents are a bit worried they may outlast their retirement savingsI'm telling them as long as I'm working and they need the $$  just get from me. It's the least I could do.,btohqsg
at an age near 70  not really a time to risk,btohqsg
Unless u stingy abt that few dollars,btohqsg
The thing i like abt ibkr is how shitty its ui is,btohqsg
Make me dont wanna touch anything,btohqsg
Good to keep long term investment there,btohqsg
this too. So no point risking,btohqsg
Im guessing i shld be concerned abt this also,btohqsg
is this the part where u offer FA investment schemes,btohqsg
now I feel like I can go be FA,btohqsg
the only fa ik rn is,btohqsg
Somehow they say my number is +65 65 and not my real number,btohqsg
im earning approx 200 a week from poker,btohqsg
young time pls save more. Yolo doesn't help,btohqsg
this is my sign to not go club tonight,btohqsg
And how much am i able to spend. I've heard of 50 30 20 rule but,btohqsg
personally when first graduated  near 90% for me.I worked 2 jobs  engineering + tuition after that. Almost 2 full time jobs,btohqsg
working hours nearer to 70 a week40 for engineering30 for tuition,btohqsg
excluding overtime and time spent on creation of tuition materials and also time on stocks analysis,btohqsg
idk how to apply to tutor like i think out of all subjects i can think of i can be malay tutor,btohqsg
But im nt sure if i can anyhow js promote myself,btohqsg
I didn't start by applying. I just post on gumtree and got calls last time.Then students just recommend friends because I'm just too good 🙊,btohqsg
at this age  seek for personal development,btohqsg
So idk later the parents underestimate me or sth unless its primary school maybe its better for me to tutor kids ages 7-12,btohqsg
eg learn skills of presentation  interview,btohqsg
or just go relax. Go walk in Macritchie.Think of work and $$ middle of uni can liao,btohqsg
u have half your life on it,btohqsg
If u can do o lvl stuff den pri sch stuff is walk in a park,btohqsg
Rates all that can adjust one,btohqsg
Ofc ur lesson need to be interesting la,btohqsg
boycott ya kun expensive coffee 😡,btohqsg
NS is good for you- from a MRed personel 😂,btohqsg
"our CO once said""NS is a privilege.""Can't really agree with him but ya",btohqsg
privilege only SC and PR here have 🤡,btohqsg
Er depends la if u ask some mono intake dudes he cfm say fk ns. If u ask someone that kena super welfare unit in ns then they gonna say shiok,btohqsg
Like for me i got into a vocation that i can interact with mono intake ppl and chao geng ppl,btohqsg
So i know how to cherish my time there,btohqsg
Depend on what voc n the peers n superior around u leh,btohqsg
If u kena guai lan section mates and command team ofc u gonna do bare minimum,btohqsg
R u going uni next yr too,btohqsg
They check phone on 1st day?,btohqsg
U got things to hide meh,btohqsg
U got stuff to hide meh,btohqsg
They wont check but do be aware sometime mp will check,btohqsg
But thats like super rare unless u in red zone,btohqsg
u all know that icons acc gdrive is downgrading right,btohqsg
what if i didnt manage to finish transferring before it downsizes,btohqsg
i think it's gonna downsize like after tmr,btohqsg
It's downsizing for those still in sch meh,btohqsg
Google drive downsizing to 5gb for all sch emails,btohqsg
But iirc they'll just freeze the account until u can make up the rest,btohqsg
i heard 1gb from my friends,btohqsg
Think another one got a secret stash on his tele,btohqsg
But he got a stash for sure,btohqsg
Is it like after the segment with parents,btohqsg
Or as soon as you step in,btohqsg
anyone here listen to lady gaga,btohqsg
Ppl still listen to lady gaga 🥺🥹🥹,btohqsg
Regardless whether saf spf and scdf,btohqsg
Ns u need black framed  plastic specs?,btohqsg
so long as dark coloured should be fine. I went in with dark green specs,btohqsg
can get these for SPORTS MODE 🤡,btohqsg
Must the receipt be date after enlistment then can claim,btohqsg
So must buy after 1st day?,btohqsg
Idek why it didn't blow up,btohqsg
Does it hurt the ear after wearing it for prolonged periods of time,btohqsg
I'm not a gd representative of the 04 LOL,btohqsg
"Like my 07 classmates jokingly taunted me like "" Ew u listen to lady gaga?"" 🤮🤮",btohqsg
I rmb I was chronically offline/away from social media such that idk what were vines back then lol   it was only during P6 MYE I started to learn abit more,btohqsg

I gg sch in 2 days :(,btohqsg
I realized combined physics has more topics than bio,btohqsg
And I have to wear long pants,btohqsg
expect ur grades to drop when you go upper sec,btohqsg
same dude  except i have break every mon and wed,btohqsg
and my sch is ending in feb,btohqsg
i think the reason why it didnt blow up is because the song is a bit too nsfw,btohqsg
it's fine there's probably still less memory work,btohqsg
doesn't mean much. Topics can be divided into sub topics and so on.Even with sub topics there could be different question patterns and types.So topic numbers alone doesn't tell how much is really tested,btohqsg
i think you can just get by remembering definitions in physics,btohqsg
u know u fked when a tutor calls u out,btohqsg
thats kinda how i got by sec sch physics,btohqsg
but theres a reason i didnt take it in jc,btohqsg
if you're just aiming to pass it works,btohqsg
atarax was from the same sch?,btohqsg
that’s why matcha thought that atarax was me,btohqsg
remembering definitions can earn you like a lot of marks in examsusually some questions just ask for definitions  you just slot in and full marks alr,btohqsg
fair enough. Though getting by doesn't mean pass to me.Pass is C6 which is honestly a useless grade.,btohqsg
for the 2023 paper  only 5 marks were definitions.But previous years had more definitions. This is for O Levels.General trend is a reduction in the number of definitions,btohqsg
which sounds good enough to me,btohqsg
for A levels itself  for 2018 paper  1/4 of the paper was definitionsBut this year  also only few marks,btohqsg
for your year maybe. For students yet to take  it is poor advice,btohqsg
But  if you have a basic understanding already  definitions are important. Many formulas do come from it.So in a way  you aren't overly wrong also,btohqsg
you can derive stuff from the definition and make sense of it,btohqsg
"Ya  but this isn't ""just by remembering definitions""",btohqsg
i did just rmb the definitions because they tell you what the formula looks like,btohqsg
works for questions like resistance.Doesn't work for questions involving drawing free body diagrams.In the new syllabus  it's unsure yet whether it will work for nuclear physics,btohqsg
In other words  for you  you already had that basic understanding  and you were very able to analyse and turn it into an advantage  which is smart. 👍Also  your mastery of practical is definitely there as well.,btohqsg
yea if you can score decently just from definitions  chances are you alr understood the definitions and concepts enough to translate it to the math. that understanding is the core skill  not just memory,btohqsg
if anything it's kind of the opposite,btohqsg
understanding well makes remembering any definition infinitely easier,btohqsg
A level physics = you just need to practice enough because cambridge doesn't rly test enough novel qns yet where it would significantly cost you a grade,btohqsg
Errr I think thats just paper 2,btohqsg
Chem actually q repetitive one in the answer key is just that the qn they can make it funky,btohqsg
"problem is ""enough"" is a subjective word",btohqsg
TYS + all prelim papers for that yr,btohqsg
in our line  we have seen students being so upset that they studied super super hard but can't score.And their definition of super hard is the few days before exams they cram everything,btohqsg
This is alr inclusive of like tutorials and stuff if you actually like,btohqsg
For me doing tutorials was more or less enough for physics and chem,btohqsg
I gave up during my papers,btohqsg
in other words  consistency.Time spent consistently on the subject adds up,btohqsg
Consistency is probably the most important factor in doing well,btohqsg
I was a C for J1 promos.But because of Physics olympiad  I studied additional Physics all the way to university physics  which eventually brought my grades up,btohqsg
Real (me when I tell this to people but they don't believe me),btohqsg
even now i don't think i have the consistency i want lol,btohqsg
what is studying for olympiad like when its outside of syllabus?,btohqsg
I was wondering and regretting why I even decided to take it.Could bo chup it but that wasn't something I would do,btohqsg
Pure hist  elec geo and combined physics  poa,btohqsg
I'm just scared of my humanities and physics,btohqsg
if you take combined physics  don’t gotta worry about anything,btohqsg
I thought bio has more content but when I looked through the syllabus physics had more,btohqsg
i thought i would regret taking physics at the start of the year but when I look at the content for bio im glad i took physics,btohqsg
bio has 12 chapter while physics has 17,btohqsg
more chapters doesn’t really mean more content,btohqsg
and I barely passed my maths,btohqsg
Physics is not content-based more application,btohqsg
sec school physics don’t have much maths  you only just need to know like your graphs,btohqsg
But some people failed physics though,btohqsg
If they fail physics it’s most likely they don’t understand what they’re being taught or they just don’t study enough,btohqsg
I hope I can get at least a2,btohqsg
i think the first few chapters would be quite a challenge because i was failing physics for the whole of semester 1,btohqsg
but then when semester 2 came i got straight A1s,btohqsg
physics quite difficult to fail (unless you take pure physics),btohqsg
im interested cus want to go into semicon lol,btohqsg
I was in semiconductor.Olympiad knowledge not too much use. Just help do well in university physics and easier to apply for scholarships.,btohqsg
easy to pass. Tougher to score A1,btohqsg
I want to get at least a2 tho,btohqsg
combined not my area. Because chem included which I can't do,btohqsg
try to not fail overall in Sec 3,btohqsg
I have had a student who can do super well in combined physics but can't do the chem portionLucky she started from pure sciences  so my advice for her was not to drop to combined science but just ignore pure chem,btohqsg
do 1 question everyday can liao,btohqsg
recently the physics component felt tougher than the pure science tbh,btohqsg
Combined science in general quite easy,btohqsg
The difficulty jump from combined to pure is err,btohqsg
Shld be able to get A if you put on effort,btohqsg
Pure science requires more understanding of the concepts,btohqsg
but i saw someone said that combined phy is 75% of pure,btohqsg
I can find combined questions that may stump pure sci students from the O lvl paper,btohqsg
Coming from somebody who has done pure and combined science,btohqsg
My sec sch comb cher made chem interesting,btohqsg
And I did well for comb sci,btohqsg
I take combined science but my tutor teaches me pure science,btohqsg
So that influenced me to take chem,btohqsg
So when I retain I took phy instead,btohqsg
Based on content not much difference,btohqsg
pure phy prac has planning component,btohqsg
No but I have tried pure chem questions before,btohqsg
combi sci is about 70% of pure for each sciessentially you study 140% of content vs pure sci 100% contentfor just 1 grade,btohqsg
more content goes together with easier questions usually,btohqsg
He gonna one on one and rizz each person,btohqsg
need to give some glimpse of hope for combi sci students,btohqsg
though I'm personally very against combi sci,btohqsg
pure sci have more areas of scoring,btohqsg
Comb sci need js some memory work,btohqsg
Lmao i got one person who nvr study for comb sci,btohqsg
I would think it this wayCombi sci  you need to be a very good generalist. Versed in both phy and chem (or bio)Pure  only need to be good and specialised in one of the science,btohqsg
combi sci quite easy to get A2 at least,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure i topped my class for comb sci,btohqsg
pure sci if you’re good at sci then you would be cracked because you got 2 subjects to add to your r5,btohqsg
What subjects you take in sec sch,btohqsg
Too many people think ofpure phy & pure chemvs combi (phy / chem)and not just pure phy or pure chem alone vs combi sci,btohqsg
Jun wei u gonna do fine,btohqsg
if you can’t decide just take pure  you can always drop to combined,btohqsg
Mine isEl  Ml  e maths  a math  comb phy chem  comb ss hist  d&t,btohqsg
I know all my of juniors taking pure sciences in sec 3,btohqsg
eh my O lvl was ages ago. I'm just here play acting as a student 🙈🙊,btohqsg
