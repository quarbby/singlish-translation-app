Sorry but I‚Äôm curious is UOB solitaire better than UOB krisflyer card?,btohqsg
To me yes   but depends on your lifestyle.UOB KF value dropped after it cannot be linked with amaze for rewards,btohqsg
they should just rename it UOB Kris+ card,btohqsg
Oic. I‚Äôm not family with amaze. I just have KF to clock miles. For the past year  fairly decent ~100k,btohqsg
i got rejected i think at 90-100k,btohqsg
force me to go update income then apply,btohqsg
If u are using Amaze linked with credit card here  I have gotten 2.1% FX with MYR in recent months  comparing with Mastercard rates. 3.25% should be above the Master/Visa rates.,btohqsg
Hi sorry may I ask how do we update the salary record please?,btohqsg
Login to their website and do permanent credit limit adjustment. They will ask for supporting doc so provide accordingly.,btohqsg
Last day to redeem krisflyer miles at 4mpd rate for hsbc revol,btohqsg
done that. i think i barely earn 25k krisflyer miles every year = 75k before telling to spend ü´†ü´†ü´†  i dont think can redeem any business class sitting without topping up heavily huhuhu,btohqsg
Biz class to BKK is only 16800 miles under spontaneous escape üòè,btohqsg
for a 3hr flight  i pass,btohqsg
spend towards a nice hotel in bkk is a better choice haha,btohqsg
How do you redeem your kf miles to get bangkok hotel?,btohqsg
shangri la hotel bkk üëÄ  i think can exchange between krisflyer and shangri la hotel points,btohqsg
but then again my points are low to the point of just redeem for cash better ü´†,btohqsg
Redeem for cash is like 2.5% rebate only for the case of hsbc revo,btohqsg
You have hsbc miles. You can redeem it directly to mariott btw. Not that i recommend that but better than convert to KF then KF to mariott,btohqsg
true  but then my intiial plan is to upgrade to biz so since after x years  if not redeemed then bobian become mariott,btohqsg
75k KF is a good business flight (one way or even return) to a few places. Again  if you cannot hit your redemption target before expiry of your miles  its time to review if miles game is for you.,btohqsg
well because of ocbc 365 and my ocbc 360 acct so i more towards getting the bang for the buck. whether i can get the miles is dependent on my spending at that time. So just treat it as soemthing can acheive and if not look for some alternatives like spending on krisshop or something,btohqsg
You mentioned you want bang for your buck so I wanted to highlight there could be better way to do it  like cashback. Anyway  you do you. Happy can already. No need to min max everything.,btohqsg
now with singpass so convenient. last time still need payslip and cpf,btohqsg
oof haha. ya i see how to go around it. its not the best/optimal way for mile chasers but because i am stuck to one bank and paycheck there so its not that easy to get miles unless i take the hassle into moving all to uob but also find theirs to be troublesome too zzz,btohqsg
if I got some money  should I top up to frs or pump it into mortgage? I want to retire early,btohqsg
if you want to retire then you shouldnt topup cpf where you only have access 55/65?,btohqsg
pay off mortgage to be debt free or invest if you feel you can do better than what you pay on mortgage loan,btohqsg
Hi what is the mcc of neighbourhood clinics? Are payment at private clinics excluded under uobone?,btohqsg
Did anyone receive this before? I also made voluntarily topup of 8k to my cpf for tax relief. Is this the reason i receive this email?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know the answer but I‚Äôm curious to follow what happens next. It‚Äôs saying refund goes to employer so you Lugi?It‚Äôs a bit related to my earlier discussions about 37 740 being the global cap (or not) if you have multiple employers.How many jobs do u hold?,btohqsg
I think isn't related to your 8k top-up to your SA or MA. Rather  the amount that your employer contributed to your CPF (across 3 accounts) was over the annual cap.So the excess amount has been refunded back to the employer  and the employer should pay the employee portion to your bank account directly.,btohqsg
Use cash or cpf to invest?,btohqsg
I think cannot pay off mortgage all at once,btohqsg
So my 8k topup MA for tax relief doesnt constitute under the annual limit of 37740?,btohqsg
Does not. You have a happy problem. Your salary is very high.,btohqsg
Hi  any thoughts/recommended actions on this situation?I had a $1000 transaction with HSBC Revo on 29Nov2024 but was posted only on the 3dec2024  hence the bonus pts will only be credited on 31jan2025. However  the devaluation of the conversion of HSBC points to miles was announced on 16thDec2024 and is effective on 16Jan.,btohqsg
Yup your 8k top up not related to the email you got.,btohqsg
Not sure.first time i encouter this. But good to know this is not related to 8k contribution for tax relief.,btohqsg
More likely is your employer contributed more than $17 340 (17% of $102K annual limit)  and you annual pay exceeding $102K for 2024,btohqsg
