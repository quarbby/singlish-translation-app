Haha. Ya. Busy with work time go damn fast,btohqsg
Need go work de go ba. Need go sleep de good night,btohqsg
We all buy the products is expensive not cheap leh,btohqsg
Chill bro. Dont so agitated. U can give free or u can give cheap price. Maybe they dont understand ur ‚Äúceramic coating‚Äù initially is the spray one. If urs is the small bottle legit ceramic application with polish @ 20$ spoil market nobody like. One ceramic coating plus polishing can goes 300 plus. U put $20 ppl also like sus. Since u said ‚Äúspray‚Äù ok lor understand why $20.,btohqsg
Morning guys have a great day ahead it‚Äôs Friday !,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not abt the price high or Low  is abt worth it or not. People willing to spend more for the car  our car all is easily more than 80k. So in some thinking is that I apply free or cheap product on my car body paint later spoil or wad then fcking not worth it. I rather go for more expensive and big Brand‚Äôs that I know then at least I have the reassurance of the thing won‚Äôt harm my car,btohqsg
Before u buy any cheap or like u felt too good to be true products  always remember  is it worth or not.,btohqsg
I keep telling myself keep it cheap possible whenever but once comes to payment and I see the mechanic go their way out do my car swee swee I always feel bad for them and charge me so cheap and I tell myself cnt pay cheap alr  this must give tips alr.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt because some cheap cheap item then spoil the car. Exterior still okay. Anything touch the engines  the brakes etc. don‚Äôt play,btohqsg
Ytd they supposed to charge me 5 guages 150 labour fee  but I they say 4 guages so 125  so I ownself volunteer tell them I feel bad making you guys work so hard and long for my car  now you charge me cheap cheap can  I will give you guys tips,btohqsg
To me  friend is friend  support is support. To support a friend  don‚Äôt ask for discount; if he give it  don‚Äôt question or ask for more. That‚Äôs a basic. People open business also need to earn money one  let them earn what they deserve. Even if u think it‚Äôs cheap  if he‚Äôs the one giving the price of the cost  then just pay it. Can maintain the rs by giving gifts during the festival seasons or etc,btohqsg
But tony case I can say he's also going all out to give cheap ceramic coating  I myself will feel bad to pay him such price.,btohqsg
I know sonax is expensive and doing the coating isn't easy job for everyone. So I don't mind paying more for that,btohqsg
I never tell the price I want  I just tell them what I want and what I request. The price u decide. U want to give me cheap because I‚Äôm a friend I‚Äôm good. U want to charge me normal cause u running a business I‚Äôm also ok.,btohqsg
Hahha if cheap and do good  I give tips,btohqsg
At the end of the day  I dw the person to have that mindset that Wah cb  do this waste so much time and never profit much and my side is like Wah  so expensive or like not worth it sia u know,btohqsg
We pay so much for the car alr  might as well pay more to make ourself feel reassured that our car are done properly and professionally,btohqsg
If every car owners have this kind of mindset  I think the world can be in a better place,btohqsg
Some got cars alr still ‰∏çË¶ÅËÑ∏ keep asking for discount,btohqsg
That one I don't like  if me as mechanic cfm will do the much minimum and bare basic for the car,btohqsg
Must tell them  will pay what u should earn  but u also need to deliver what u had earn,btohqsg
Hahaha like what you said lo ‰∏ÄÂàÜÈí±‰∏ÄÂàÜË¥ß,btohqsg
I learned the hard way. I trusted a workshop to things i requested  bodykits  car spray. I even experience engine fault and also brakes never eat. Paid an amount of 4k for bodykit installation and spray paint  they still can fucked it up. Check on brakes ‚Äúall ok bro‚Äù.Sometimes is not about the price  its the workmanship and attitude.Went to KGC to fix my bumper and alignt etc cost me $500 plus per bumper and spray. While i went to a another place offer me $300+ for the same service  and it turns out better than i expected.Sometimes is not just about the money  is about the attitude. So if u wanna spray ur car  fix ur bumper  tinting  wrapping  do contact@JasonCai. No regrets going to him.,btohqsg
eh ya... i think i want to respray my car. lol,btohqsg
Find@JasonCaireally worth ur money  ur time  and he takes care of ur car like his own,btohqsg
No obligation  you do can ring me up or pm me ü§ó,btohqsg
thank you sir. will pm u when ready. i resolve my engine oil burning issue first loll,btohqsg
I close eye pretend no see. Hahagaga,btohqsg
Sure bro . Settle those important stuff first,btohqsg
To me for car  performance more important then anything,btohqsg
This is what the workshop did. Improper job for a 4k,btohqsg
haha yea inside done liao then do outside. every now and then need to top up eo very painful.,btohqsg
Not scaring you but better check it first . The only thing worried might need overhaul engine,btohqsg
This was after jason did it,btohqsg
no worries  already intend to overhaul actually.,btohqsg
Replica bodykits can never be perfect  but jason did it his best to give as perfect ss possible,btohqsg
So is not about the amount. Any amount u paid but u can never beat someone who put it effort in it.,btohqsg
Previous was 1 week 3 days  just to fix their shit which they didnt,btohqsg
Allergy or just random sinus attack?,btohqsg
For random sinus attack  i would just do plank to divert the blood away from the nasal area,btohqsg
Maybe sleeping will solve my issue,btohqsg
Ohh. That one I dunno how to help  but I got a sinus spray. I always use that whenever I have serious sinus in the morning,btohqsg
