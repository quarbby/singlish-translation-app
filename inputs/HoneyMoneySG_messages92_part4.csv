Very true. At that age I would prefer less hassle to manage investments and good to have a guaranteed income monthly till I die regardless of economic conditions or how my investments are faring,btohqsg
The problem is the inflation. What we see now is S$4460 every month in the future. 20 years later  the future $4460 actually is equivalent to $2000 today.,btohqsg
Yup. But there‚Äôs also some amount of lifestyle disinflation as you get older too  spending less on clothes  food  travel. (Assuming your healthcare needs are already taken care of  which will be the major component still increasing as you grow older),btohqsg
No it won‚Äôt count towards the annual SRS contribution cap,btohqsg
Ah that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs the option of an escalating plan to combat said inflation,btohqsg
Until I reinvest the sum deposited into my bank srs account  is that correct?,btohqsg
The only thing that counts against the annual SRS contribution limit is when you deposit Cash into said SRS account. Any gain  loss or dividends/interests from SRS investments won‚Äôt count,btohqsg
I see thanks for the info.So let‚Äôs say I received $100 dividends from my SRS holdings for 2023 on Jan 1  2025As of 2024  I‚Äôd still have the full SRS 15.3K right?That means it‚Äôa possible for me to deposit 15.3K for this year‚Äôs tax relief but invest 15.4K (the dividends earned) back to whatever instrument?Thanks again,btohqsg
Since SA is going to close when I reach 55. Assuming I have no problem achieving the FRS. Wouldn't it be a good strategy to move my OA to SA or top up my SA to get the 4.08Ÿ™ as much as I could before I turn 55 so that I can earn that 4.08% compounding and any excess will flow back to OA rather than letting my OA fund sit still at 2.5%? And i can withdraw my OA when i reach 55? Of course this is based on the assumption that I have no use of my OA.,btohqsg
That is what i am doing,btohqsg
yes correct. so if u really have no use for your OA funds  u can top up to SA as early as possible to gain the extra interest.,btohqsg
For those below 55 and SA already hit FRS  what is the best strategy now?,btohqsg
previously is many using SA shielding loophole to create a high yield savings acc from CPF SA after 55.Thus they can choose whether to withdraw the amount or int portion on yearly basis to facilitate early retirement or maybe also can use to fund travel funds.,btohqsg
Yep  but same logic with or without new CPF rules. In the old rule  you can also transfer OA to SA  then that SA forms part of FRS instead of pulling from mandatory SA contributions. Resulting in mandatory excess SA/OA withdrawable,btohqsg
No change in strategy for those below 55 imo,btohqsg
basically nothing much to do now. Get higher paying job to increase cpf contribution more or create more income stream as sole proprietor so that you can MC more into your cpf acc to get higher int out during these few yrs till 55?,btohqsg
any one have any idea if using citi cash back+ master card for snack investment have any cash back?,btohqsg
Hi all  one of my family members is intending to apply for uob one account. He dosent hold any uob before. For this promo  if he puts in new funds $100k and dont withdrawn this funds  can get $558 right?Second question is  upon opening the account  need to deposit money immediately? Or is it possible to wait 2-3 days later then deposit the funds?,btohqsg
Only Amex got miles? I remember my Amex give miles that time,btohqsg
Nope Amex also don‚Äôt get miles all insurance are under the no earning,btohqsg
I got it when I top up using Amex Sia miles card that time,btohqsg
I think Amex cash back also give cash back. If I‚Äôm not mistaken   but I‚Äôm not sure about other card provider,btohqsg
I only know of UOB absolute Amex give cashback 1.7% other then that no other ? Unless you using a payment provider to earn ?,btohqsg
think u need to read the tnc of amex cards in detail,btohqsg
I only know they reward for Chubb‚Äôs,btohqsg
Wish to sign up HSBC revolution card for sign up promo  but renovation spending not eligible to clock for sign up related transaction?,btohqsg
Sorry I missed it out but I did said suggest uob absolute Amex which is a better option ? HF not widely available for average unless you want to go through the hassle ?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
UOB stash not showing the reached milestones for bonus interest in the app. Heard usually it only shows up in the following month after newly opening the account  is that true?,btohqsg
Hi  What's the best credit card to use to buy a new phone from Singtel? On heymax there is only 1 MCC code for Singtel. Not sure phone will be under this MCC or not?,btohqsg
If U transfer OA to SA. Then u will lose the chance for RTSU for income tax relief. Depends on your strategy,btohqsg
You can provided your SA is not max out (hit FRS) and you really do not have any use of OA in the mid term to long termalso is irreversible. Cannot take out and put back into OA,btohqsg
RSTU is a tax relief hack. That some people employ. The thought process is: if I'm going to put aside this money for retirement. Might as well put it in SA and get 1) 4% ROI 2) Tax relief also.But it depends on you annual/overall saving or investment strategy that you are adopting,btohqsg
So if there no plan of using cash to top up  the transfer of OA to SA make sense?,btohqsg
As long as you don't intend to use the OA in the immediate future. E.g. housing  child education etc.,btohqsg
Hi  did you all change your Citi rewards card from statement month to calendar month ?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs more convenient for you then u change loüòÇ I changed for my uob. The rest nvr cuz I find it troublesome üòÖ,btohqsg
Have to register for the Rising Dragon promo first before putting funds in,btohqsg
I called Citi before they dont allow to change leh.,btohqsg
Hi  if I have 200kIs it worth to transfer to1Ô∏è‚É£Uob one account - transfer 100k (currently -0balance) - get $588 angpao + 5% interest (uob salary + $500 credit card spend )2Ô∏è‚É£UOB stash account (currently 0) - transfer $100k get $588 angpao + $3k in interest a year,btohqsg
You may want read clause 2.5 in the TnC.,btohqsg
uob stash is 3% p.a. interest and u only get one set of $588  so uob one is better. Put the other $100k somewhere else,btohqsg
Tfs from which bank and what's the exact steps you did?,btohqsg
hahaha its a tax relief scheme not a hack though. hack is unofficial  and may eventually be closed (eg SA shielding was a hack),btohqsg
CNY holidays over since last Tuesday leh. if you transfer correctly should see it tracked by next working day.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask  as a fresh grad  is it advisable to apply for another credit card so soon if I just got one? Trying to build a miles stack.,btohqsg
oh even Maybank has switched to App authentication. No more SMS authentication for online transactions?,btohqsg
I called about this a few weeks ago  they told me it depends on merchants.,btohqsg

There is a reach survey for the recent budget,btohqsg
