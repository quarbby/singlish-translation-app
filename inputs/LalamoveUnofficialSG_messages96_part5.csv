Anyway  like what ÈªÑÂ§ßÂèî say  use brain. Familiarise  put in some effort. I see newbies keep coming in ask so many qns  wanting to be spoon-fed. If the chat gone or everybody bz  then gg,btohqsg
Dun waste time n effort if no stack  for car drivers,btohqsg
Stack two bike jobs oso better than take one car job sometimes,btohqsg
How do i change my mode of transport? In-app cs?,btohqsg
It's not a new pattern. It was under their tnc and training I think you didn't notice.,btohqsg
Stacking was unofficially allowed last time.. but some drivers of course spoil market.. their eyes became wider when they saw the +++... stacked and then late.. of course vendors complain their food late..So... it is only us drivers who are to blame for no more stacking..,btohqsg
Fully agreed saw some drivers stack 3 order from 3 diff restaurant to 3 location in north side. Cfm late one,btohqsg
That 1 not as jialat as what I saw. Driver stack 3 orders. From 3 diff restaurant  drop off 2 at East Side 1 at West Side. üò≥üò≥üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hello I‚Äôm checking if anyone is interested in promoting my products on carousel  and get a pay of $$300 24 hours after postingPm if interested,btohqsg
If so good.... who still need to do lalamove,btohqsg
ask you guys..for cash orders  should client make payment first before we pick up?,btohqsg
i always check with them if payment at pick up or drop off. if they say payment at drop off  dont complete the order and press cash collected until they pay,btohqsg
Always collect money at the pickup point b4 start delivery or make sure the money has been transferred to ur account b4 the last drop off point...Reason... LLM policy to collect payment b4 finish delivery. Example.. if pay by credit card.. payment made b4 delivery.. so cash payment is the same also.. NO Difference tell the customer.Better to protect urself than having to waste time chasing customer or contacting CS for payment..,btohqsg
But sometime reach pickup point customer tell us to collect from receiver,btohqsg
Anyway I had quit LLM   totally not worth it,btohqsg
Work as pt if happen to go that area then ok,btohqsg
Yes..  so u contact the receiver and tell them u are on the way but pls transfer the money as it is LLM policy to collect money b4 deliver.. if not LLM will take it out my pocket if i dun follow this policy.. something like tat.. at the end the day.. u want to make sure he pays up and not run away after delivery...,btohqsg
Yeah   but I met people who are old + talking to them need waste more time.,btohqsg
Then dun deliver until payment made..  simple.,btohqsg
Hehe we in losing end   waste trip to pickup point or waiting for payment to be made then we got delay for delivering and get suspend etc etc  anyway i stopped Just sharing my point.,btohqsg
Well.. to each own.. try to chase a customer for payment or ask CS to chase.. then one lagi waste of time...Cannot be delay delivery for more than one hour right.. if he is paying for the item.. he will be kanchiong to receive the item he paid for.. if he is willing to pay $200 for the item.. he will be kanchiong to quickly pay the $20 delivery fee so he get it faster..I have no problem w payment when i explain to them payment b4 delivery..,btohqsg
