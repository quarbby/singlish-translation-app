They consolidate 1:20.$0.01 become $0.20.Anyways don‚Äôt jump into Amos. Wait for Danny Lien to stop . Once he stop  I believe they players will come.I heard he have sold 200 mil shares before consolidation and only Bbs have ability to collect that much.Retailers took 20mil shares at best. If best case 50 mil is with retailersChips are with the players now. My view but don‚Äôt buy. It will take some time to materialise,btohqsg
