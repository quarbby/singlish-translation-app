So where is the oil going to be disposed off?,btohqsg
Peugeot quality has improved a lot over the years. My 7.7 year old Peugeot has no major issues so far. More reliable than my previous VW. But one think I must admit  french design cars to look good but not practical to service. Eg  in order to change battery  have to strip so many things. Engine filter is located deep under the engine bay  below the windscreen  breaking my back when changing it.,btohqsg
Same question I had. I tried changing oil once  then realised I don't know how to dispose the oil. Workshops need to pay for disposal so unless you know the workshop well  can pass to them to help. End up I passed the oil to a friend to help dispose at his construction workplace.,btohqsg
