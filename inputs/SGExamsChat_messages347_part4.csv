Idk if i filtered xss correctly,btohqsg
I hope can improve q abit or at least ard the same sia,btohqsg
yeah  to train AI to know how to recognize objects,btohqsg
fixed deposit already higher than OA,btohqsg
Not all tho and OA is more stable,btohqsg
if u want to lock up your cash  it's not OA now  but putting all into SA,btohqsg
your first 60k gets an additional 1%. Coupled with 4% for SA  you get 5% on your amount,btohqsg
However  you are exchanging time during youth for money.It's possible to increase other forms of knowledge so that your rate of earning increases.Use some maths. At $10/hr earnings  let's say u work 8hrs a day at 30 days a month. That's $2.4k monthly. But this $2.4k monthly stays at that rate if you remain status quo and do nothing else.Now  let's say you take the time instead to upgrade yourself in some useful knowledge. Let's say 5 years from now  you start out earning $4k monthly working 20 days a month. That's a $1.6k monthly difference. Assuming no promotion and status quo  you break even with a fixed 2.4k monthly after 7.5 years.In this scenario  the breakeven happens when you are only in your early thirties. The difference becomes significant in favour of the 2nd path when you hit your 50s.,btohqsg
Not just that  spending the time and effort also helps increase your rate of returns. OA is fixed at 2.5%. You mentioned you want to save for housing  so additional 1% does not apply as that would go into SA.With proper knowledge and risk management  it's not tough to hit a low returns of 4% or more to achieve your target with minimal risks. Plenty of people have done that over past many years  with higher rates at a safe way.,btohqsg
My objective of typing so much  I hope  is for you to look further ahead and think different from your current plan  to see more possibilities. üëçüí™,btohqsg
My plan is really just to use my holiday work money for OA for housing XD,btohqsg
i'm planning to buy it once the fed announces the rates,btohqsg
eh but silver sounds good now,btohqsg
i mean buying the silver itself irl,btohqsg
not my area of reading or knowledge üôäüò¢,btohqsg
me too  all i heard is some logic from somewhere on how inflation we can buy a lot more silver and when it deflates the price of silver still remains the same so we basically hedge against inflation that way,btohqsg
Regardless  a gain of 200% over a small capital still loses to a gain of 2% over a large amount of capital.And because this chat group is primarily students  that's why I mentioned to build your human capital for now.,btohqsg
There's a financial blogger whose dividend income is mid 5 figures monthly on an average  I guess  6% yield. Can search for ASSI.,btohqsg
I did forget to consider the minimum sum needed,btohqsg
For me  because of some other promotion  I managed to deposit within OCBC for 3.48%  but it's only for 1 year,btohqsg
at pizza hut  which was the plan?,btohqsg
Was advising Joshua  he mentioned working at pizza hut to save all into OA for future buying of HDB,btohqsg
idk i just invested my money instead,btohqsg
not worth for most  is just because of personal circumstances that I needed to take up the promotion. Liquidity is locked up.Singapore Savings Bonds are good enough generally.I also placed a little into Frasers Green bond just out  4.49%.Astrea bond  4.15%Low yield stuff but should be safe enough.,btohqsg
have to open cdp is it,btohqsg
ya i was searching online on how to buy in it,btohqsg
Can someone teach me how to use it?,btohqsg
hm that one idk  i still haven't open it,btohqsg
You need to be 18 yo min,btohqsg
Idk if you still need to go down to buona vista for it,btohqsg
As how to best utilise it  not how to open it,btohqsg
I have one linked to DBS Vickers,btohqsg
Can just go Mbs one also,btohqsg

Don't worry. You most likely are like me  don't have anything valuable for them to track.,btohqsg
