kuro out here inventing his new brand of math,btohqsg
if i'm only summing 0 and 1 i'm not writing the 1 on top each time,btohqsg
i mean they're used a lot to indicate complex phases,btohqsg
One of the common applications is for ac circuit,btohqsg
How did u even think of imaginary infinity,btohqsg
Because ac circuit have sine wave,btohqsg
have you even learned complex numbers,btohqsg
So u use complex number to make it go leading and lagging sine wave,btohqsg
But that’s too much for the people here,btohqsg
i infinity is just like + and - infinity but in the complex plane,btohqsg
but you don't have to care about that,btohqsg
Do u rmb when TM teach,btohqsg
