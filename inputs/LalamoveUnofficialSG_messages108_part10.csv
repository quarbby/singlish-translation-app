As mine in April total 1.6k after petrolEarnings is at 1.3k...,btohqsg
Petrol 300 SGD approx  earning 1.3K SGD?,btohqsg
Take near one don‚Äôt go far2,btohqsg
More far more lugi petrol ‚õΩÔ∏è very fast gone,btohqsg
anyone drives a hybrid/electric here? how is the range like for yall?,btohqsg
That's good for a wk wor. On average 1 mth u can make abt 6k after diesel cost?,btohqsg
I drive electric mpv  range is agar 400km- charging cost ard $30,btohqsg
Depends on charger  but its the only EV that can fast charge on AC,btohqsg
So SP AC43 from 10% to full is ard 2hrs,btohqsg
I will use AC at shopping malls,btohqsg
Yeah  more and more on the road,btohqsg
But its a very spartan car,btohqsg
Even though its an EV  the tech and stuff on the car machiam early 2000,btohqsg
Bad part bout it is back seat cannot fold,btohqsg
Its like driving a year 2005 car,btohqsg
No cruise controlNo folding back seatNo folding mirrorInterior all plasticFront windscreen tend to fog upCar Finishing alot of nitty gritty issues like not aligned and stuff,btohqsg
But its ev range is the longest(max i reach 460km)Can charge receiving nearly 40kw AC(most other evs cap out at 11)Battery is very reliable(BYD blade battery),btohqsg
Overall  I dont regret trading in my Xtrail for this car,btohqsg
EV will not take off if there no charging STN in every single carpark in Sg... we not bigger country where most ppl stay landed n able to charge from comfort of home,btohqsg
buy car for convenience not to have more trouble,btohqsg
Its actually more convienient than you think,btohqsg
More and more shopping malls have charging station or charging station near malls,btohqsg
we need more at HDB n condo cp,btohqsg
Every dot on here is charger  even though some is blue sg charger,btohqsg
most critical part is cost n availability of models ... not much choices at the moment,btohqsg
So it will be about 40-50k more,btohqsg
Cuz battery smaller capacity i think,btohqsg
Byd is supposed ro be cheap,btohqsg
ah tiong will laugh at usüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
This is the price they buy in rmb,btohqsg
150k rmb is their selling price if they wanna sell,btohqsg
No hor is hw much byd sg earn,btohqsg
Gov take gst and coe only,btohqsg
I heard they still got gahmen subsidy if take up EV. sg is charge you gow gow... u still tink they really want a green environmentüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
BYD no more production for fuel car  they fully focus on EV,btohqsg
there's ARF tax. pap aready earn 120% tax for every car value u buy,btohqsg
Actually byd car very good since 5-6years ago le,btohqsg
All other cars yes.. but E6 no,btohqsg
no Coe they aso huat till siao,btohqsg
Want to convert  now best time. While gov still keeping up the subsidies,btohqsg
Oh  BYD used to make ICE vehicles?,btohqsg
Yup byd started with making ice cars,btohqsg
Yes  but market share very minimum in China. So they give up,btohqsg
Their early cars were modeled after toyota altis,btohqsg
Den they have the dynasty series,btohqsg
Chinese ppl will choose byd if they go for economy type EV,btohqsg
The new E6 is the EV version of ÂÆãmax which is 1.5L ice car,btohqsg
But TBH China have more and more EVs competitor now,btohqsg
Xiao Peng  Wei Lai all those,btohqsg
