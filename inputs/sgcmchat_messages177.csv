the depre is really pretty for it’s form,btohqsg
you need to see the one my friend has,btohqsg
it’s maintained amazingly because last owner collector,btohqsg
shit was made in 2008 LOL,btohqsg
i got post some pics of it before,btohqsg
one of my fav cars to be around because of how amazing the car actually looks and internally,btohqsg
he changed head unit and going to change steering wheel soon. but the current one still looks super modern,btohqsg
seats are also lightly modified  super comfortable and of course the previous owner gave a “free” exhaust system,btohqsg
my friend thinks it’s akrapovic but still not too sure. will probably check when have the time to,btohqsg
Any1 going for the overtake event later?,btohqsg
ain’t this the gt4rs at the porsche cafe,btohqsg
Its the same car i think,btohqsg
@Infini_IIIdo U have any clue when it was manufactured?,btohqsg
Im not rlly into eudm in sg so i dont know a lot abt them,btohqsg
Mb I was thinking of the overtake anime,btohqsg
those that they bring to c&k from time to time and park beside each other are the demo units,btohqsg
my reaction A BIT late ah but it’s a cyan ferrari 488   just zoom in guys 🙏🏼,btohqsg
bro your reaction like pearl harbour,btohqsg
BRO i had to process wtf was gg on 😭,btohqsg
bro if the car is 2024 you are still in 1887,btohqsg
porsche cafe to be exact 🤓☝️,btohqsg
Hey I think I saw the new 2023 cdg Prius taxi,btohqsg
Hahaha but srsly tho electric? I think it rly depends,btohqsg
Yeah  one advantage of electric car is it's more efficient and charging an electric vehicle is cheaper,btohqsg
How long does it take to charge an ev?,btohqsg
The electric Prius looks Soo good,btohqsg
I don’t care elec or not still nice look,btohqsg
Design wise not bad but headlights a bit the boring looking ah,btohqsg
For a Prius quite good leh,btohqsg
Little as 30 mins or less,btohqsg
My friend boarded the 2023 Prius taxi but he say the back of the taxi a bit squeezy,btohqsg
Ohh maybe as taxi not that good then,btohqsg
That shi- ain't in sg yet,btohqsg
Not it takes roughly an hr +,btohqsg
That one actually I search the internet so I may be wrong,btohqsg
We just wait and see lor,btohqsg
bro violated u with 2 words,btohqsg
I’ll violate u with my 2 hands,btohqsg
One day I hope to get one too,btohqsg
i'd love to get an STI someday,btohqsg
Just cos I repaint my R33 doesn’t mean it’s ur,btohqsg
yesss that area alw got exhaust but can nvr spot where it’s cmg from,btohqsg
hr+ for full charge but usually 20mins is enough for a normal day,btohqsg
this is the hardest hangman i’ve played,btohqsg
Nah wait how are u admin,btohqsg
let's have a duel at high noon,btohqsg
call me travis the way i got these scotts,btohqsg

pls pardon   i’m on a fast moving vehicle,btohqsg
ohhhh but in sg heat 20mins long time sia lol,btohqsg
sorry as a singaporean  singapore not that hot lol,btohqsg
i suffer when i go to cold countries,btohqsg
try sit in traffic on bike,btohqsg
you wait i turn off air con when we go drive,btohqsg
you are in the presence of the best racist and greatest racist.,btohqsg
dont worry la. not in full gear still not that hot,btohqsg
i was there till like 10,btohqsg
most ducati owners i’ve talked to all hate riding their bikes on the daily because of the heat,btohqsg
first gear for legit 20 mins,btohqsg
brother why are YOU NOT IN NEUTRAL,btohqsg
cfm the fucking roundabout at bishan right,btohqsg
eh but i tell u now,btohqsg
if u think ur R15 is bad,btohqsg
just don’t say sg not hot pls,btohqsg
i mean rn sg relatively not hot,btohqsg
but once this whole abnormal climate is over,btohqsg
it’s not even the bike bruh,btohqsg
sg gone be hot as heck,btohqsg
oh u mean the sg heat,btohqsg
Can confirm. Theres one or two models that are less hot (naked models) but the sportbikes are pure torture,btohqsg
naked will always retain less heat,btohqsg
the one that i’m surprised about is i haven’t really heard anyone complain of heat on a H2 before,btohqsg
Yup  the fairing is basically a chimney diverting hot air to your balls,btohqsg
I think its too rare  not enough owners,btohqsg
his one is H2R but he play track only,btohqsg
also i just want to say i find it damn retarded people saying they want a H2R as a dream bike but want it to be able to corner faster than a MotoGP spec bike.,btohqsg
i cycle and saw before but idk it was a r33 till my frn told me is aorund novena and orchard,btohqsg
you'll need to fix your run on sentences before your results fixes them 😂,btohqsg
stop it before i say@a_junnis hot,btohqsg
singapore is hot because im in it 😎,btohqsg
I mean dec-jan always rain a lot,btohqsg
Only the hypermotard can tahan maybe,btohqsg
The rest so packed the heat dissipation gg,btohqsg
This is why even if you're from SG you still need to pass IELTS for many unis,btohqsg
it’s decent but idt as good as hypermotard,btohqsg
personally this is why i went for an r15 instead,btohqsg
I think you should get nmax,btohqsg
i’d rather eat my own shit,btohqsg
So they never pack so much,btohqsg
Try sitting on them in traffic or standstill with shorts on,btohqsg
Ducati heat dissipation is good if you're moving,btohqsg
Inb4 the shave gets your skin also,btohqsg
you think this one covered under fire theft,btohqsg
I think this one covered under medical insurance,btohqsg
Who agrees with me on pop and bang are nice but when u over do it just becomes damn annoying,btohqsg
@k4gesyr new vid u good ah 💀,btohqsg
you out of pocket man 😭😭,btohqsg
just tuck it in your pocket,btohqsg
double it and give to the next person,btohqsg
Hm rly? Damn I always thought it until dec,btohqsg
i mean it depends on what kinda pop and bang,btohqsg
if it has flares and shit rev however u want,btohqsg
but if its like normal just bang then uhm,btohqsg
after 4 times shuddup unless ppl ask u to rev more,btohqsg
i think pops and bangs are mostly fucking disgusting  esp on turbo cars where they are just fart cannons. There are some small exceptions here and there (some mclarens maybe?) but 99% of the nice sounding pops/bangs are on NA cars and the car is not intentionally tuned to produce them,btohqsg
Don't do it in a residential neighbourhood,btohqsg
Pop and bangs at car meet near residential area is basically the same as calling LTA and TP to the car meet.,btohqsg
i think we just gotta enjoy wat we have lah,btohqsg
its btr than having none at all,btohqsg
When ppl 2 step and disperse the meet 10 minutes after u drove 40 min to arrive  its hard to enjoy bruh,btohqsg
ye thats the shitty part lah,btohqsg
welp just gotta learn how to control,btohqsg
so that LTA dont harass us,btohqsg
LTA not harassing us fr. They are responding to residents being harassed in their homes by pops and bangs,btohqsg
light overruns from lifting off the throttle is still fine,btohqsg
Cooper S  M cars tend to do that.,btohqsg
but actual pop and bangs aren't good sounding imo,btohqsg
unless they serve a performance purpose. i.e anti-lag on WRC cars,btohqsg
There are some light pops that is fine. Not those loud and disturbing bangs.,btohqsg
i concur. if the car has it stock and isn't obnoxious  it's fine.,btohqsg
Most bmw burble is subtle and nice,btohqsg
the light overrun is quite pleasant in sport mode actually,btohqsg
Also y r u up. I tot u sleeping in,btohqsg
not too beng  not too obnoxious. subtle enough to remind you that you're in sports mode,btohqsg
fixed my sleep schedule  i think.,btohqsg
no more check engine light ah,btohqsg
yesterday all the warning lights pinging,btohqsg
they can pop on upshifts from ignition interruption and resumption,btohqsg
and fuel can can dumped into the exhaust from aggressive cam overlap,btohqsg
not from turbo fart cannon style tunes from dumping fuel into the exhaust yes,btohqsg
what rubbish. you tune cams to pop?,btohqsg
cam timing and overlap to pop?,btohqsg
I think the difference here is intentional and functional (anti lag) and unintentional / aesthetic (crackle map),btohqsg
hey man if you dont like my opinion  dont listen to it,btohqsg
a golf gti is a very good example,btohqsg
Im pretty fucking sure though that any given car doesnt pop and bang while stationary in a carpark,btohqsg
i already told you what causes pop. dont give me this tuned to pop and 'by right na cars should not pop' nonsense. the same logic applies to all cars,btohqsg
our friend thinks turbo cars are 'meant to pop' unlike NA cars. lmao,btohqsg
i think you're missing the ENTIRE point here,btohqsg
i drive a turbo family car,btohqsg
yes it pops and bangs like an aventador 😍😍😍😍😍😍,btohqsg
bro. dont you know. aventador got na engine. not meant to pop. you are imagining things,btohqsg
they aren't supposed to pop and bang like an american school to begin with 😂,btohqsg
Functionally speaking this is not wrong. Post engine ignition for anti lag is intended. Keyword here is functionally.,btohqsg
stop making up nebulous terms with no actual meaning like 'well tuned na cars',btohqsg
you have no fucking idea what you are talking about,btohqsg
You’re not talking to each other at the same frequency,btohqsg
learn about what happens during ignition cuts and aggressive overlaps which are inherent to engine design and not nonsense like  'tuned to pop',btohqsg
most of the people here are kids,btohqsg
but purposely adding a pop and bang tune to your NA cat a shitbox doesn't make it cool,btohqsg
well u see a novitec 812 does pop and novitec is a well known tuning company no?,btohqsg
it's like saying a well kept car is more than likely to survive a road trip as opposed to a shitbox beater,btohqsg
U guys arguing over Functionally tuned or public nuisance tuned,btohqsg
it does because it's a performance car in itself,btohqsg
Ya pop and bang is damn XS,btohqsg
they’re arguing over NA cars popping i think,btohqsg
i was really about to give this kid a hard time but it seems i dont have to now that others are chiming in. dont come in here with your 12 year old 'na cars should not pop' bs. go back to tiktok son,btohqsg
it helps to understand how engines actually work,btohqsg
suck squeeze bang blow. applicable to the bedroom.,btohqsg
quoted here for posterity. one of the most retarded statements ive seen in here in a long time,btohqsg
hi okayama ( val (simracing) ),btohqsg
12 year olds are not supposed to talk about this they know nothing about too but that doesnt actually happen does it,btohqsg
i’ve actually lost the plot of this argument,btohqsg
this is what happens when 12 year old egos start to inflate,btohqsg
too much fucking tiktok rot their brains,btohqsg
they watch a 30 second clip of a 12 year old telling them NA cars are not supposed to pop and suddenly they all up in here telling us how engines are supposed to work,btohqsg
i'm quite sure no car manufacturers makes their car sound like the quiet kid in school,btohqsg
if your car doesn’t have a rpm limiter you can pop one time very loudly,btohqsg
subway surfers gameplay below to reaffirm their point,btohqsg
ah yes. that first decathlon meet,btohqsg
you can't kill a K series,btohqsg
Putting aside the very insightful automotive engineering discussions  i think all agree pop and bang at meets near residential are fked up  tune or no tune. Till we meet again 🫡,btohqsg
since did you hear me say i money shift the family car,btohqsg
so when are you 9GTronic swapping the R33,btohqsg
what the fuck is 'unless specifically tuned to pop' supposed to mean? This is what i mean when you need to stop making up terms with no meaning. THere are plenty of engines tuned for maximum performance that WILL pop because it is inherent to the design of the engine. You are too far down the dunning kruger curve to even know what you dont know. just stop trying to come across as some sort of authority on this. you have no idea what you are talking about,btohqsg
M series  amg (NOT AMG LINE)  Audi S and RS if they pop and bang still ok cuz they got horse run,btohqsg
terms like 'supposed to' and 'specifically tuned to' are subjective cop out terms and not used by people who actually know what they are doing,btohqsg
and there we go again  keep rehashing the same shit,btohqsg
All of them got standard one not so monotonous and abhorrent pop and bangs,btohqsg
hi  rmb to use when u go see doctor or geng mc,btohqsg
give me biggest racist tag i stop k,btohqsg
They practicing here trying to run for Parliament in 2025,btohqsg
Whe agrees with me on this,btohqsg
He’s focusing on the nuisance tunes by the NA cars at the local meets here,btohqsg
can 9gtronic swap scirocco or not 🌚,btohqsg
Sometimes the spirit of discussion is more important than winning my brothers,btohqsg
the rocco engine will piang before u swap,btohqsg
just put the nmax cvt 🥰,btohqsg
need bring back like 30 cartons of gudang garam js to rebuild engine 💔,btohqsg
If u have driven the CLA / A 45 u know their gearbox is shit,btohqsg
havent driven one but seems like it,btohqsg
They set shift timing too fast that why have fart,btohqsg
@jimpuscomplained about the c63 AMG gearbox,btohqsg
It's fast on mid to high rpms,btohqsg
As long as u running 120 or 150^ can pick up alr,btohqsg
VW reputation abit spoiled alr leh,btohqsg
I mean gti and R are decent car,btohqsg
If well taken car then no they wouldn't have issues,btohqsg
the best golf would be the r32,btohqsg
i think this goes for any car in general?,btohqsg
I have friends doing high 500whp on mk7 and 7.5 R and gti still no issues,btohqsg
we've had our car for awhile now,btohqsg
well maintained  only niggles are the TPMS sensors breaking after a year ish,btohqsg
that aside it's been very reliable,btohqsg
Mk6r and gti kena wack when problem come those idiots go sell car cuz no money fix,btohqsg
"then the ""in general"" doesn't add up",btohqsg
yes there are contis with shit reliability,btohqsg
but overall most modern contis are not worse nor better than their competitors,btohqsg
For vw R and gti if u mod before u better overhaul once it reaches 150km ≥,btohqsg
depends on how abused it is too,btohqsg
if lightly modded i think it should be fine lah,btohqsg
Once modified its best to do unless u talking about stage 1 with just intake then isok I guess,btohqsg
But from what i seen and know alot kena wack alr in market,btohqsg
Some even water leaking into inside of the car when heavy rain,btohqsg
Those no money go buy car but when problem come they no money fix the straight away sell,btohqsg
MOST Dealer usually go reset odo and do slight touch up to the problems,btohqsg
At most few days to 1 week u can see problem pop up alr,btohqsg
See also: bring to questionable workshop / tune for power but not the safeguards to handle it,btohqsg
Alot mk6R I know using stupid tunes that will f up the engine and turbo,btohqsg
Those who know will know what i mean,btohqsg
CLA/A45 also but there are still q a few decent units in the market available,btohqsg
I know of an idiot who change turbo 3 time because of his tune,btohqsg
Pull atw to 7k rpm and pop all the way,btohqsg
Turbo break still nvm. Block crack  piston crack  rod bent  gasket leak,btohqsg
All free gifts for next owner,btohqsg
List of cars to avoidE9x bmw 335iHeavy modified CLA/A45 (unless u know owner or friend of friends with owner then ok  or find those engine not molested)Mk6r and gti,btohqsg
For some reason audi S and RS from what i know not much issue other then wiring wise cuz not many of those no money people buy the car,btohqsg
Ask any ws mechanics if u gum with them they will advise you not to go for 335,btohqsg
And yes for your previous replys,btohqsg
Say yes to low road tax 😚,btohqsg
F chassis still okish but maintenance damn chor if u suay kena camshaft issue u cfm die cock standing,btohqsg
Just dont go >500hp if u want reliability,btohqsg
Audi and wv 1.0/ 1.4 best for low road tax 👌,btohqsg
I will just put here blatantly and pls no offence taken but if u dont have the $$$$ to maintain the car is best is to not get high maintenance car and just better to stick with what your pocket is comfortable with,btohqsg
i think the s4 also abit sus hahah,btohqsg
those owners like to abuse then renew 5y only kind hahah,btohqsg
Should be common sense but… 😔,btohqsg
The A4 all wanna be rs and S suddenly,btohqsg
For some reason S 4/5 especially the 3.0 high maintenance car,btohqsg
yes that’s what i thought too haha,btohqsg
Cuz then engine placement is very annoying,btohqsg
If one issue pop up u need up engine alr to solve the issue,btohqsg
I would recommend NA cars for those who still want power but no money maintain cuz they have the least issue when it comes to problems other then leaking and seals as compared to FI,btohqsg
holy shit this chat is stupid,btohqsg
what have yall even been arguing about,btohqsg
fast around 1-2hr  slow around 7-10hr,btohqsg
Anyone need recommendation on any car if you are buying soon and want to know what to avoid? Feel free to ask me,btohqsg
a lot of things you say i don’t agree,btohqsg
what car should i buy for first car,btohqsg
wah i js read the whole chat,btohqsg
who started whole convo one 😭,btohqsg
fucking retarded ass kids arguing about buying cars if u got money just buy la no money then just sit back suck thumb. simple,btohqsg
Hey cb U got nothing good to say just stfu can?,btohqsg
Ngl but alot still do the opposite of what u said,btohqsg
Wow my friend bought these liao,btohqsg
my mother used to mr beat me,btohqsg
can everyone ping rayyan and say hi,btohqsg
eh fuck i deleted every message of his,btohqsg
I wld like to report this admin,btohqsg
i should be racist in return,btohqsg
ORR u can get a butterfly knife,btohqsg
i just sold the sports one,btohqsg
we talk about real shit now,btohqsg
eh ride R15 don’t forget stay in wrong lane,btohqsg
im working js so i can get the fn ak empress 😭,btohqsg
at least i don’t need use simplygo,btohqsg
you don’t use cos u no money top up ezlink card,btohqsg
i will demote@k4gescos he no PDL,btohqsg
since i’m bored i’m gonna give some hot takes but if u argue w me means your taste is sufficiently bland,btohqsg
all these kiddos disagree w actual owners but never go anywhere close to car ownership or experiences before 😅,btohqsg
you need to step off your high horse. pop and bangs have very different ways of being produced.next time before spewing information  be sure you’re on the right page before being aggressive to EVERYONE,btohqsg
carspotting for them is close enough 😂,btohqsg
that is exactly my point. and i was only aggressive to one person. did you even read the above?,btohqsg
They like paying $1 for rides in cars,btohqsg
are you sure you tagged the right person?,btohqsg
they think an obnoxiously loud supercar means its the fastest in the world and the owner gets laid everyday,btohqsg
we still on this topic ah 😭,btohqsg
I think the only cars that should pop and bang are EVs,btohqsg
they haven’t heard the ek yet,btohqsg
That's why they think Maseratis are fast,btohqsg
Put them in the back  ride Chevron in the wet,btohqsg
but idk if he got vid anot,btohqsg
you whack and you're still doing legal speeds 😂,btohqsg
YOLTEX then scrub off the bottom part of the Y,btohqsg
my bro it literally looks like you arguing with nobody,btohqsg
i was speaking to only one person. if you cant even see that....you need to read it again,btohqsg
check literally every post i made and who i quoted. please,btohqsg
you gotta do this properly before giving hot takes bro,btohqsg
as a Ioniq 5N enjoyer i agree,btohqsg
best EV since the Ioniq 5,btohqsg
sad truth abt this chat tho hahah,btohqsg
see car pop pop then steam alrdy then talk big,btohqsg
and if you dont like what i have to say. i'm sorry but you're nobody to me  and i really dont care.,btohqsg
there is literally no deleted msg or someone u tagged while going on your rant,btohqsg
thats a lie. i saw the msg get deleted,btohqsg
what does this even mean? I quote posts then reply,btohqsg
i didnt delete a single fucking post,btohqsg
huh wtf why recent actions got no deleted msgs,btohqsg
seriously. wtf is going on here,btohqsg
everything went quiet until your racist bro suddenly came in with his half baked hot take bro,btohqsg
can you please ask him to read properly before anyhow hamtam,btohqsg
i think the fella got banned  then messages gone,btohqsg
he accidentally deleted all the messages jn,btohqsg
but i got better things to do than get tied up in this BS and seriously dude@twelvethirtyfiveyou really should check properly before going off on  people,btohqsg
nobody is going off at you bro,btohqsg
are you sure you not going off?,btohqsg
it’s not like i’m cming at you going to scold u all,btohqsg
you literally told me to step off my high horse and stop arguing with everybody  long after the so called argument stopped,btohqsg
and now you wanna say you not going off?,btohqsg
you totally misunderstood the whole damn thing and saw fit to pass judgement like some edgelord,btohqsg
ya k4ges purged every single one,btohqsg
yall be hatin on majority of the car enthusiasts worldwide lol,btohqsg
ok la fair i believe i was too harsh on u,btohqsg
"have you not seen how shit those ""enthusiasts"" have made the scene",btohqsg
but i don’t believe the response to him was favourable at all.,btohqsg
same type of people to have takeovers.,btohqsg
ok some like the takeovers r quite shit,btohqsg
but there are ppl that loves the pops and bangs,btohqsg
i also don’t like him  he got cause shit before herebut response not so favourable  mistake on my part i apologize,btohqsg
well i disagree and i dont care what you opinion on the matter is. and since we're sharing opinions here  my opinion is you owe me an apology for how badly you misunderstood what was actually going on,btohqsg
"the only good ""scene"" is a quiet cars and coffee",btohqsg
quiet then half way through will have an V8 start up,btohqsg
quiet until one fella in a 335i comes in with pop bang tune,btohqsg
ok wait why yall dun like pop and bang,btohqsg
is it cos loud or wat,btohqsg
it’s harmful to the engine usually when done up by amateurs,btohqsg
I don’t like cos disturb ppl,btohqsg
unless it's mild overruns  it's god awful,btohqsg
or those who like pop and bangs do it because it’s cool and don’t realise it disturbs people,btohqsg
pop and bangs in general are horrendous to hear,btohqsg
at least bov can still tahan,btohqsg
I’m ok w it just not in housing adrea,btohqsg
thanks. insurance payout can get FD2R alr,btohqsg
i’m ok w it as long as you don’t treat your car like shit,btohqsg
no eh i feel like burble tune is ok when not overdone,btohqsg
Nah I like shitboxes getting run down,btohqsg
golf 1.4 want to pop and bang also actually ok one,btohqsg
but if you pop and bang in residential means it’s on purpose alr,btohqsg
and sexually assaulted cat a cars,btohqsg
usually it’s js part and parcel of building up the EA888,btohqsg
the best pop bang and burble i loved was probably from a Cupra,btohqsg
yes part and parcel of total engine failure 5000kms in,btohqsg
"a ""build"" is a sketchy tune with pops and bangs",btohqsg
and a hideous aftermarket carplay system that works only if you punch the screen and pledge allegiance to the ccp,btohqsg
i mean a proper 1.4 golf built for power  but their pop and bangs also not intense lol,btohqsg
every upshift maybe one pop  every downshift maybe one or two,btohqsg
brother i hate to say this but,btohqsg
small cc engine and built for power,btohqsg
the amount of money thrown in,btohqsg
you can buy a proper sports car,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHA but road tax cheap mah. so if they want to build also cannot say much,btohqsg
we all have our own like preferences,btohqsg
but a 1.4 Scirocco still makes plenty of torque stock,btohqsg
brother now we having a normal convo then u trying to break up a argument,btohqsg
people having convo u just butt in,btohqsg
eh u all need to read the texts w/o having feelings eh,btohqsg
yall really more than sensitive yk,btohqsg
U oso damn aggressive to me 4 what,btohqsg
bro you start shit i warn uou,btohqsg
can take a fuck ton of power on stock internals,btohqsg
i think the only part of the yaris,btohqsg
is the inline three seems more like,btohqsg
a bit hard to start learning on,btohqsg
cos of how rare a inline three is,btohqsg
i think simply because it's a unique platform ba,btohqsg
but it makes amazing power  especially the corolla,btohqsg
you don't see stupid inline 3s with 270hp,btohqsg
rotaries have been around for awhile,btohqsg
but we do see inline 3s with crazy hp/weight ratio,btohqsg
it’s essentially a similar learning curve to rotary i mean,btohqsg
no i’m just getting lin involved in the convo,btohqsg
but that inline 3 already so highly stressed,btohqsg
i've seen some push 500+ hp on stock internals,btohqsg
ngl i think it still has a bit more to give,btohqsg
then some with light tunes  310ish hp the car piangs,btohqsg
maybe i’m looking at 600 with forged internals? but thats higher side of things,btohqsg
but the part im curious on,btohqsg
is if it still handles just as well,btohqsg
cos to me toyota has been making cars made to feel good while driving and not powerhouses as of now,btohqsg
but supposedly stock isn't as good  to autocross,btohqsg
yeah apologies@DogeMasterz  i accidentally deleted the convo by the other guy,btohqsg
i cant find the fb post,btohqsg
meant to delete only one message i accidentally press delete all,btohqsg
i mean it’s HP and not WHP,btohqsg
but when u take into terms what the car is it’s crazy,btohqsg
going to go ahead for e85 too,btohqsg
there comes a point where power doesn't matter,btohqsg
wonder if it's still dailyable with that kind of power/weight ratio,btohqsg
but stupid power builds are very neat,btohqsg
imagine trying to pull away from the lights gently,btohqsg
