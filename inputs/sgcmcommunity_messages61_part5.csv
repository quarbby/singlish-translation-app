Have leh have leh! Quadrifoglio woot woot!!!!!!!,btohqsg
AMG GT Roadster for me anytime if I have the unlimited money hack downloaded.,btohqsg
similar layout  bore  stroke etc...they really just did cut 2 cylinders,btohqsg
296gtb and giulia qv uses the F154 V6 engine,btohqsg
Thats true. 1st world problem haha.,btohqsg
Ya they ditched the dct. Zf is quick enough i guess and responsibility not on bmw,btohqsg
can develop the car more haha since zf is trusted,btohqsg
Ya a lot of people say its the same block just less 2 cyl. But cant confirm haha,btohqsg
but this sounds super heavenly mann,btohqsg
Ya definitely one one of the best sounding v6s,btohqsg
how was your stelvio ownership though?,btohqsg
It was fun  steering is super responsive and very on point. Body roll is evident but way way less. Sounds cliche but it doesnt behave like an suv.,btohqsg
The car is much lighter compared to its peers and its very obvious,btohqsg
Sad. The DCT was one of my favs. Just awesome listening to it so it‚Äôs thing. ZF is now too.. smooth and digital (sorry if that doesn‚Äôt make sense).,btohqsg
if what you crave is the downshift throttle blip  the alfa QVs do have that too in a racier setting,btohqsg
issit the zf cannot blip or smt haha,btohqsg
and is the auto rev match,btohqsg
or the opposite. can‚Äôt rmb someone told me smt abt it,btohqsg
Even the upshifts are nice to me. The shift aggression in setting 5 or 6 is just awesome on high revs,btohqsg
wah which rickshaw customer let u drive his qv hahaha,btohqsg
Then no 8 banger things leh,btohqsg
I only read about it and pirate stream old Top Gear episodes in between customers üòõ,btohqsg
Ignore me. I crave many things I can‚Äôt afford.,btohqsg
hahaha for a period of time in my life i unsubscribed all the motoring channels and news and pages,btohqsg
take your time  enjoy what you have and work towards the dream,btohqsg
Just wondering what do you guys think of the Alfa Stelvio,btohqsg
Pre face lift bro. Thanks for the compliment! üëç,btohqsg
Yes  when I had my RS5 back then  it sounded great.,btohqsg
dct don't last in city driving,btohqsg
What‚Äôs an actual price that you‚Äôll accept for an A3 2018 1.0?Good transacting price for seller,btohqsg
What should you do if someone steals your car overseas?Losing your car while overseas is a distressing thing  but it is important to know what to do next instead of panicking.üëâüèª React with üëçüèª if you find this advice article useful!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
but as a seller  95-100 wld be good to me,btohqsg
I would suggest getting the 1.4 CoD though,btohqsg
Fuel efficiency is similar but drive is better,btohqsg
the other SUV thats great to me  is Seat Cupra Formentor. drives hard and handles well,btohqsg
Oil change done outside twice.Remaining repairs done at PA,btohqsg
Good car but my only worry is parts availability. Alfas have gotten better in terms of reliability but the issue is that if and when they do break  service centre and independents don't tend to have parts in stock and due to supply chain issues  parts can take a very long time to arrive,btohqsg
i think it wld be a good price,btohqsg
Therefore I would go with a macan S or higher based on which variant of the stelvio you compare with,btohqsg
Anyone wants to buy at 95k?,btohqsg
95k in the current market good,btohqsg
Sgcarmart sure want to buy  can sell through bidding or through the ads,btohqsg
Need to pay‚Ä¶pain and no guarantee will sell at 95k though‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I would suggest doing the bidding on sgcm and other platforms to get a gauge of the price dealers offer you,btohqsg
Usually can get 4 to 6k more,btohqsg
For most entry to mid tier contis,btohqsg
I shall not name the platform as I'm afraid of being banned but a competitor of sgcm does free evals and only makes you pay when you sell,btohqsg
good info.. many  thanks for sharing.. Alfas  reliability is much better now.. I use to remember it have Alfas having itsown idiosyncrasies,btohqsg
But sgcm bidding fetches higher price,btohqsg
Although you need to pay 68 dollars for the inspection,btohqsg
