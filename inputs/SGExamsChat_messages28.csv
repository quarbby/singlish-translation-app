Amidst the flood of COVID news and updates  here's something interesting that happenedhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/377a-challenge-dismissed-high-court-judge-penal-code-12588738,btohqsg
in the air force  everyone knows how to spell record,btohqsg
"He said that Section 377A ""serves the purpose of safeguarding public morality by showing societal moral disapproval of male homosexual acts"".^ It's interesting because it's implying that there is societal moral approval/disinterest of female homosexual acts",btohqsg
Female female hold hands nothing wrong. Male male hold hands gay,btohqsg
I think it could just be that they can‚Äôt mention female homo acts,btohqsg
Well it's my lights out timing so yall can enjoy the discussion  I'll read tmr,btohqsg
Or rather they don‚Äôt have to mention female,btohqsg
well isn't the fact that there isn't a 377B or something for female homosexual acts,btohqsg
a testament that they endorse or at least tolerate,btohqsg
Anything for 377A  need ask parliament la,btohqsg
Yeah i agree with the article that it's not a debate for the court,btohqsg
The challenges against 377A have been dismissed,btohqsg
Basically it‚Äôs a reassertion by govt that we are keeping it,btohqsg
Ah gong gives u money to spend  still want make noise,btohqsg
wait why is there a discussion about this?,btohqsg
breh theres a 7 in 377A,btohqsg
What's so interesting about oh that's interesting,btohqsg
I'm sorry  we are learners for life let us learn about this,btohqsg
Later ah gong take back 10k after giving u 1k then u know,btohqsg
I know this isn't SGTekong but,btohqsg
His line of reasoning is fairly valid in my opinion  but there exists too many political and societal reasons to implement it anytime soon,btohqsg

What‚Äôs so devils advocate about this,btohqsg
Military service is physically demanding and potentially dangerousService isn't physically demanding to all. It's also not potentially dangerous to all.community service for one yearNational Service doesn't last a year. It also doesn't last 'just two years',btohqsg
Just keep your distance and don‚Äôt get coughed on,btohqsg
