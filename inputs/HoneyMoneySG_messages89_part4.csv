With City PayAll which you originally stated you are looking into,btohqsg
Hi all - any idea if the latest snack flashdeal promo make sense ? Capitalstar voucher for purchasing ILP.,btohqsg
Is there any miles card that we can use to earn high miles to pay for teleco bills  straits times subscription or utilities bills?,btohqsg
Depend if u think it make sense or not. Other cant decide for u. For the last 1 month  the nav range is ard 2 percent difference. So the voucher for 8888 is 1.5 percent and 3888 is ard 2 percent. If the nav broke the range u can end up losing more then what u get. But it might end up higher as well. Who knows,btohqsg
Hi guys  during key collection for bto  does hdb wipe your oa until 20k or you have option for them to wipe a certain amount?,btohqsg
You have the option to do OA shielding. Same concept as SA shielding.... Invest in something before the wipe.,btohqsg
For those using DBS ALTITUDE. It says free lounge access per year for 2. If you have used up 2. Will it be auto renewed the next year?,btohqsg

I was informed by Hsbc that insurance premiums paid via giro will not earn the 1% cashback for EGA account.Can anyone confirm this?,btohqsg
@jraphg96please check where you're sending your messages/pics.,btohqsg
There are always other way to go around that if it is true  just clock the insurance premium to any card directly/via axs or via cardup/ipaymy then giro the cc bill to hsbc,btohqsg
In my priority pass app  it shows expirws 24 Apr 2024. Does that means  it will be auto renewed next year?,btohqsg
As long as u hold the card it will auto renew after that date,btohqsg
How are you planning to pay for your insurance premiums? Using the HSBC banking website/app?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGDo you have a video about how to dca/rsp on ibkr?,btohqsg
How is the scb e saver account? It is giving up to 3.6 percent interest,btohqsg
"Search results on youtube ""honeymoney dca ibkr""https://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=xFmH3FK-9jkVJvWD",btohqsg
Seems Cimb visa infinite has loungr access to 3 persons too,btohqsg
"Only oneligible incremental balancebased onaverage daily balance.Which means it's most effective only if you use it foronemonth  and for this promo  best is during Mar.I would give it an ""only deposit if you have abundance of cash but absolutely no where else to put  and you really need it to be very liquid"" or ""deposit here if you need a reset month on your OCBC 360 account"".You can read the tnc for more info.",btohqsg
Agreed too. Not so worthwhile this time.,btohqsg
I will just pay insurance via AXS.  Consolidate all on my credit card then pay my card bills via EGa GIRO to get 1%,btohqsg
Currently on giro with UOB one account,btohqsg
??? Why would HSBC give you 1% cashback for you paying with GIRO on your UOB One account?,btohqsg
Thought of switching over to giro with hsbc ega acct if it gets that 1% cashback,btohqsg
Does transferring oa to sa and leaving 20k in oa works the same?,btohqsg
I thought only self initiated giro payments and giro payment for HSBC credit card will not get the 1% cashback on EGA? Should be be able to get 1% cadhback paying insurance premium  no?,btohqsg
Read clause 5 in their T&c.,btohqsg
Just to highlight that insurance is an exclusion for One Card for the Bonus.,btohqsg
That is referring to insurance premium on hsbc card? Not on ega giro.,btohqsg
From what I understood  1% cashback not given if you charge the premium to HSBC credit card,btohqsg
Back to my questions again.1. Are you planning to pay through HSBC bank website/app?2. Are you planning to pay using HSBC EG debit card or personal credit card  not via GIRO?,btohqsg
Should be able to get 1% cashback if you pay premium via giro from HSBC ega,btohqsg
Want to find out whether  i can get 1% cashback if i giro my premiums thru ega acct,btohqsg
I think you just follow this:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/170189Easier to do  just GIRO on the card bill üëçüèª,btohqsg
Hi All  want to check‚Ä¶does Citi rewards  uob evol and lady‚Äôs card work on1) Kris+2) Favepay3) ShopBack payWith respective miles or cashback?,btohqsg
Check t&c‚Ä¶. But crmc catch is Kris+ works via Apple Pay which is mobile contactless,btohqsg
Yes to allOther than Kris + cannot for CRMC unless you have an android phone to use amaze instead to convert when using  Google pay,btohqsg
Erm  if I say yes you believe if I say no you believe? CSO could have already given you the wrong data üòÇ and others giving you alternative like charging to a cc and giro your cc to EGA. Not sure what validation you need‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea what is meant by transport and shopping for the new DBS Live Fresh,btohqsg
Hi if i want a miles card for 1 - 1.5k travel spend (Air flight ticket  hotel) every 2-3months  what card should I get?I already have a UOB one card   account and citi rewards w AMAZE.Should I get UOB privi or lady's? Or even try lady solitaire?,btohqsg
the terms and conditions dont seem to state any MCC,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc/ lady solitaire travel cat,btohqsg
Lady‚Äôs solitaire for higher cap. Same bank as your UOB One  will aid in AF waiver in the future,btohqsg
have ways to go around this though. not hard.,btohqsg
Please do share with us andKetanwho's asking about eSaver. üëçüèª,btohqsg
have multiple esaver account. (1 - single  1 joint),btohqsg
sometimes it also makes sense to get a uob account.. i enjoy the promos from both esaver + uob.,btohqsg
that is generally the dbs pattern unfortunately  you have to infer the mcc based on the examples given,btohqsg
uob privilege is also a good account to squeeze 0.1%  0.2% more,btohqsg
Someone shared she is doing DCA for VOO in MooMoo. Not sure if need to pay fees each time she buys but was thinking if use Webull to buy VOO is free ya?,btohqsg
