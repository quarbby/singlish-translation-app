pretty shite quality tho the rooms bright,btohqsg
i myself got a s22u lol,btohqsg
i mean ofc he hope everyone in the class can get along well,btohqsg
and he say he doesnt expect me to make the first move cause he can tell that i was q affected,btohqsg
chers usually arent that hands on for me lol,btohqsg
tl;dr smth happened between me and a boy in my class in 2021 and we ended on horrible terms,btohqsg
then like today i told my teacher about it (because i had to report smth else to my teacher that not related to the boy)Then we talked and he asked me about jh stuff so i told him,btohqsg
matcha do yk dhs’s pw distinction rate this year? my only source is someone from reddit lol,btohqsg
how did the cher end up finding out?,btohqsg
hm i ask my friend for u,btohqsg
tbh this incident is popz in dhs like alot of the ip ppl. so if he knew i wouldnt be surprised,btohqsg
used to be outside but now is stored indoors,btohqsg
These buses sounded so freaking great modern buses don't even compare to 10% of its level,btohqsg
dammm  wait u yy wat again,btohqsg

⚽️ Looking forward to Euro 2024? StarHub  Singtel and mewatch will be charging an early bird price of $88 for live broadcasts  a slight increase from 2021.https://str.sg/AHNF,btohqsg
meanwhile  pw and chinese was the only spread i saw which i didnt really care much (i would rather see the rest of the subjects but THEY NEVER SHOW),btohqsg
i think most schools is like that? I heard that people who actually got C is coz they didnt do work so the sch need to report to MOE and blah blah,btohqsg
i dun think fail is in the vocab of PW grades  so good for the class of 2025 onwards  there is no 1.25 that actually matters (more for some  less for others),btohqsg
in fact the vocab of PW grades is only A B C,btohqsg
Bro you got see the news? Jrl delayed to 2029,btohqsg
The people I worked with even say got possibility delay to 2030,btohqsg
my CTs dun care about whether we get along  they just accepted the fact our class is far from being bonded,btohqsg
i know it is hard  but i guess that is what every teacher will hope for coz 2y is very short time spent tgt as a class,btohqsg
Bro I tell you LTA bloody slow I never thought a company could be this slow,btohqsg
But i think it is true though,btohqsg
I do hv a (repeated) tea,btohqsg
PW grades is directly proportional to the pw tutor’s tutoring skills and passion,btohqsg
musician's formulagrades = k(passion+ tutoring skills),btohqsg
It is hard to reverse what he did to u but maybe treat it like giving him a chance to redeem himself  like give him a 2nd change…at the same time he needs to play an active role in this as well,btohqsg
the mshs toilet notice is going viral,btohqsg
Imagine PW A rate overall was 47.9% and then there is a class w 100% dist (true scenario btw),btohqsg
I cant imagine an econs teacher teaching pw btr than a gp tutor,btohqsg
she teacj the opportunity cost of getting an A,btohqsg
And that is majority of pw iirc + a good pw tutor also properly coach OP and qna,btohqsg
My econs cher told us she will not say u are her std if u never get A,btohqsg
But too bad she fr tp  we didnt have a chance to get her💀,btohqsg
wait when u grad there wasnt merger yet?,btohqsg
Ya see it depends on ur luck pk the good tutors,btohqsg
I took pw in j1 —> still before merger,btohqsg
he say he doesnt expect me to make the first move cause from what i said he can kinda tell he hurt me q bad,btohqsg
i have a schoolmate thr pri ach,btohqsg
cld never know if the guy liked me to despised me lol,btohqsg
If u dun hv passion  it is unseen unless u dun put in effort  so as long as she teaches well…,btohqsg
at least I know the maris stella boys never change,btohqsg
"the sign said ""masturbate in your own homes"" 💀💀💀💀",btohqsg
Yes i also feel he needs to make the first move…,btohqsg
ok kuro thanks for this phrasing,btohqsg
But there is a citation machine for that,btohqsg
better to learn how to do citations properly,btohqsg
"soon ill see an acjc notice saying ""stop touching girls at the most random times""",btohqsg
That is so heavy on time,btohqsg
like thing is pw they literally don’t care how you do citations,btohqsg
as long as it’s not obviously messed up,btohqsg
also i saw pw daddy today,btohqsg
i mean when i do my papers latex makes it very easy,btohqsg
dhs taught us citation since y1,btohqsg
Actually i dun think i used it going back in time,btohqsg
also pw no one actually checks the citations,btohqsg
sum chers try their best tonotsee our work,btohqsg
anyway@aforace@Polarbearnextdoor@whatisgrassill try to not side eye the boy as much but then as my cher said i wont be making the first move  will update yall if anyth happen,btohqsg
I read a reddit on that but that was yi,btohqsg
wah my teacher never teach this at all  we had to use chatgpt for our citations,btohqsg
oh wait do yall see each other f2f?,btohqsg
I hope for the best! Dont force urself to do anything u dun wish to,btohqsg
i tot RI wld be more hands off,btohqsg
also teaching citations is one thing but people will still fuck it up easily bc there’s so many diff types of sources you can be citing,btohqsg
at least like the specific 2 chers seem to be doing more this yr for us,btohqsg
thhe teachers demand too much ah,btohqsg
my mentee had a normal PW experience in RI,btohqsg
i fixed their WR citations tho,btohqsg
that’s just a pet peeve for me LOL,btohqsg
btw si yan u r at nus or ntu again?,btohqsg
i’m an ntu student but i go to both every week,btohqsg

i think ntu is too generous,btohqsg
sounds that i enjoy listening to,btohqsg
tbf you learn that in chem but it's completely rooted in physics. you just don't learn that part,btohqsg
""" I think ntu is very generous"" To what extent is this a fair statement?",btohqsg
P: any how accept despite my low cgpaE: for example i got 3.xx and somehow gave me a courseE: this shows that they wanted me to have an early deathL: therefore i think ntu is conspiring something,btohqsg
what do you think he does on a daily basis,btohqsg
oh so there will be induced current,btohqsg
by faradays and lenz law some things magically happen,btohqsg
oh and some particles can have two values of spin  some particles can have 3 etc etc,btohqsg
oh in our syllabus we use h,btohqsg

guess the subject im doing rn,btohqsg
It's not a bug it's a feature,btohqsg
Kuro guess the subj I'm doing now,btohqsg
nobody would exercise late at this hour,btohqsg
I have a gp WA tmr,btohqsg
U can do it one 🫡,btohqsg
u can try SIT if u going eng,btohqsg
jiejie know what subj I'm doing now,btohqsg
My maths on Mon but it's pnc,btohqsg
collagen is insoluble in water because hydrogen bonds,btohqsg
So ik I damn fucked alrd,btohqsg
no legit ik math oly medalists,btohqsg
Even vectors I nvr scold as much,btohqsg
I want to fucking slam my head against the wall and rage quit,btohqsg
maybe i got a gd maths teacher,btohqsg
Like I find drv far easier,btohqsg
Nah it's just me prefering calculus,btohqsg
Guys why do I need to learn PNC in my poly..,btohqsg
So I'm not too worried for that,btohqsg
Cuz to me the argument shit is just,btohqsg
Go poly also need to learn amaths,btohqsg
I can do last time but I very long nvr do so likeee,btohqsg
I prolly forgot alot of shit,btohqsg
Worst is my course is coding,btohqsg
I on maimai ban until 22 nov,btohqsg
Why tf do I need to learn log for coding,btohqsg
How is matrices gonna help me in coding,btohqsg
coz life is about choices and taking calculated risk i guess,btohqsg
bruh FR can't escape pnc eh,btohqsg
ya prob and stats gonna hunt u forever,btohqsg
I kaopeh alot but ik must suck thumb la,btohqsg
I learnt 🪵 and probability in poly,btohqsg
I still have the notes I made,btohqsg
Then somemore iw uni econs so like....,btohqsg
if I end up hating stats....,btohqsg
I think for now is just,btohqsg
Try see the other topics w open mind first,btohqsg
a maths qns i had in poly,btohqsg
it's literally lvl 0.5/1 of my fucking tutorials,btohqsg
This isn't to flame poly or wtv ah,btohqsg
But right we're just traumatised by H2 maths,btohqsg
I got like 2-3 topics all fucking hbl so like,btohqsg
i guess its relativity of the work ah. coz we poly kids used to this intensity rdy,btohqsg
wait ill see if i can pull up some exam qns,btohqsg
use tree diagram lah so much easier,btohqsg
the hard qns in poly is like the first qn of tut for A lvls,btohqsg
how to use tree diagramn on the laptop,btohqsg
and we can leave exam early,btohqsg
like u done just submit paper,btohqsg
I had a stroke when I see the fucking formula sheet eh,btohqsg
AND AMATH DONT EVEN GIVE FORMULA FOR THOSE,btohqsg
some of my exam is js mcq,btohqsg
we had it hard so yall must get it hard also: prob some one said this in MOE HQ,btohqsg
but do you think its tricky,btohqsg
I think H2 maths also got,btohqsg
bruh i legit never study for gp,btohqsg
my ans was B cause idk what i was doing,btohqsg
if i understand then no  i mean u got a 25% chance of getting the qns right,btohqsg
super biased but idl the us high sch system,btohqsg
lol look like normial distribution hahaha,btohqsg
i prefer one big exam compared to consistent work,btohqsg
which is why i chose alvl,btohqsg
ok la good what easier to score means easier go uni,btohqsg
because i know i am the type to screw up small tests but do okayish in the big test (lets ignore how i fumbled y4 promos),btohqsg
idk what tf i was doing,btohqsg
no leh i think its the same,btohqsg
intensity go up den u will also go up,btohqsg
tbh i cant remember how i fumbled y4 promos that badly,btohqsg
i think i legit gave up for some reason,btohqsg
Isn't that the whole chs bullshit,btohqsg
idk about ntu nus but SIT is legit cram 2 eng maths module in 2 trimesters,btohqsg
but anyway fumble is fumble la as long as dont fumble alvl can alr,btohqsg
isnt that like following the us liberal college bs,btohqsg
looks hard  but actually not so bad,btohqsg
so u have triple integration in first half of the trimester  and stats in the 2nd half,btohqsg
nah bruh..there a reason i put 0,btohqsg
within a month need to master all of them,btohqsg
i keep inhaling the copium that as long as i did well enough to do the alvl subj i want y4 promo dont mean shit,btohqsg
"Let's be clear that NTU and NUS aren't liberal art colleges we closed our only one in SG cuz it ain't ""valuable""",btohqsg
Wait can y'all use pen and paper for workings???,btohqsg
i think got one mod they teach u how to write professionally one,btohqsg
coz my prof from nus and he teach the same stuff,btohqsg
coz SG pragmatic  only want degree what have immediate impact to economy,btohqsg
yes but there is no method mark,btohqsg
the paper will be throw away,btohqsg
"Liberal arts ain't rlly ""art"" lmao its just more of a general education degree",btohqsg
Kinda teaches you to sharply question the conception of our world.,btohqsg
My friend doing his PhD in Maths now started off doing a chem degree at a liberal arts Boston uni before he changed major to physics then changing major to maths before he wadio,btohqsg
nah im just a lowly engineer,btohqsg
Yeah.. liberal arts is not created as a alternative to STEM degrees it preceeds our conception of Science which is very recent.,btohqsg
if current theory holds  it shouldn't be possible,btohqsg
damn usually the chem -> physics -> math isn't that fast,btohqsg
I believe in reals extended with infinity and perp such that 0K <=> thermodynamic β = \pm infty :))))),btohqsg
i like how i am so behind on my work but i still don't seem to care,btohqsg
dude schools me about affine spaces every other day aaaaaaaaaa,btohqsg
you can school him about uh,btohqsg
That's like a classic j1 experience tbh....,btohqsg
My parents would legit scold me if I do sia,btohqsg
i like how there's the random comment about negative temp,btohqsg
But fr tho I didn't feel anything ystd,btohqsg
Cause I didn't finish the 30 days,btohqsg
ya what for every one day u fast you wi get 10x the reward what,btohqsg
so fast for 36 days= whole year fast,btohqsg
isnt that what islam teach you,btohqsg
No I need repay back 4 days asap,btohqsg
i think my class no one got to uni except for 5 people,btohqsg
eh bro uk SUTD hard to get one,btohqsg
big 3 was out of their choice,btohqsg
the last i heard la they dun see gpa but your minimum should be above there to even qualify,btohqsg
from what i read online ah,btohqsg
and this is like 2021 info so,btohqsg
my year NTU aeronautical was like 3.5 ish so yeah damn diff,btohqsg
you'll probs never deal with it unless you do physics,btohqsg
Holistic there's always outliers in data but at the end of the day it's like saying your snr won 4D and u expect that u gonna win 4D too,btohqsg
In fact I expect it to be worse as NUS pivots to Holistic and tbvh NTU like half convinced at this point,btohqsg
Of course they don't. But that's the first thing they look at,btohqsg
If they included my data it would be 1.98,btohqsg
Assuming ceteris paribus conditions when the world ain't like that,btohqsg
Quite a lot also Y3 their gpa shit then they gamble at Alevels some make it so when they grad they apply as Alevels candidate but in the polys eyes it's still entry into uni,btohqsg
In fact they damn fucking ticked off that they couldn't use my data for their GES,btohqsg
Legit I mean in the polys eyes u went into uni what with their qualification,btohqsg
Even if it wasn't the deciding factor,btohqsg
Then u also have the misleading claims for local med. Nursing diploma went in to YLL med... what they didn't tell you is he 3.95 or 3.99 and he took Alevels after first time failed and his Alevels was AAA/A,btohqsg
huh only 1 ppl grad from SMU?,btohqsg
there is a reason why sit is called home for poly grads lol,btohqsg
That one is 80% Poly ppl,btohqsg
gpa too low to enter NTU/NUS/SMU but no money for private/oversea uni,btohqsg
but damn.. 1 person only and not just SMU alot other also,btohqsg
sutd is by interview n stuff right,btohqsg
oh its for rp only ah,btohqsg
Cuz of holistic. The intake actually dropped lmao,btohqsg
others its about there i think. dun belive the bs ur lecturer say about certain poly gpa is weighted higher,btohqsg
wait so RP to uni abt a few hundred oni?,btohqsg
told me uni staff gonna take SP grad more than ppl from RP,btohqsg
but imo its the same la,btohqsg
but he told me smth which is quite real,btohqsg
So even if it is trying to.. which I mean I guess the intake size decrease so less spots,btohqsg
go for the lousy course and ace it so u get 4.0 easily,btohqsg
like easier compared to getting 4.0 in a harder course,btohqsg
so easier to get scholarship sponsorship all that,btohqsg
i tot gonna be <1% lol,btohqsg
very worthy of respect to the 2% tho,btohqsg
That's all I am going to say,btohqsg
It also has to be a relevant diploma,btohqsg
If u wanna smurf do it at Uni level... cuz Post grad is a lot more free than Undergrad.,btohqsg
hii can I ask what does SOI stand for,btohqsg
Cuts out Med and quite a lot of STEM courses,btohqsg
Let's just say I graduate with a BA in History with FCH. I can apply and qualify to MD  JD and not to mention I can go back to PhD in History,btohqsg
I do a Diploma in idk Chinese at NP I graduate I can only apply to relevant courses mostly in CoHASS and maybe computing,btohqsg
Even if u dont Post grad u go out with BA u get higher GES,btohqsg
Win Win either ways and since its a local uni most general jobs and Government Jobs are open at executive level,btohqsg
If I grad with BMS diploma I come out become technican level,btohqsg
like few hundred dollar more compared to ite cert only,btohqsg
It's like artificially depressed wages for the actual knowledge u have,btohqsg
U learn so much and so much stress if u fuck up become test tube washer,btohqsg
bro actually found the date i posted it,btohqsg
slighter better than the welfare for ite grad only sia,btohqsg
from what i heard from my ite classmates back in poly  his internship as ite student is legit like clean aircraft toilet kind,btohqsg
To their credit its like a 30% increase,btohqsg
But like 1.8k to 2.2k is not a lot in net percentage,btohqsg
poly abit better can sit in office talk to boss but still is like sme kind and small scale one,btohqsg
Both numbers are peanuts so look like it's a decent increase but lanpa both cannot make a living long term one,btohqsg
The first time I actually seen an office job was when I declared I was a uni student,btohqsg
Even then it's Olevel grad. ITE cannot even compare.,btohqsg
Also lmao his wages not a lot but then again inflation stayed stable for like 15-20 years,btohqsg
cannot comment  diff ppl diff risk appitite. if he invest in bitcoin in 2010 he can retire anytime now,btohqsg
Yeah and the S&P netted like a 8-10% Annualised gain even if it was just STI still would be a good 7-8%,btohqsg
but as a o lvl grad cant say much ah coz legit can invest better than no invest,btohqsg
I don't think that's possible now tbh,btohqsg
no kid no gf stay with parents plausible,btohqsg
That one ain't a life it's just called subsistence,btohqsg
but how long and how much u wanna invest is makes everyone diff in the long run i guess,btohqsg
Just fucking kill me at that point bruh end this fucking hell which is late stage capitalism,btohqsg
there's still hope in this nation,btohqsg
@MIKANNNNNNNNtower transit trolling bro  single decker 854 😭,btohqsg

I mean i gets and 1.25rp may heavily affect more for some  less on others (depends on how one looks at it and ofc some ppl really just aim for 90rp n nth less)…but others may view this as insensitive because that is still a rather decent score (even if i actually went to read the prev posts),btohqsg
lmao got sum1 banned from cabin club n his still here,btohqsg
I wonder if this story is even real,btohqsg
Even MI has no D for PW,btohqsg
If it’s true probably from YI,btohqsg
Like I seriously haven’t heard a single person getting D for PW before,btohqsg
I dun think D is even existent,btohqsg
C is the lowest and even then most schs don’t have a single C in any given year,btohqsg
Unless that dude really did 0,btohqsg
I’m guessing that story is fake or that person is just exaggerating stuff,btohqsg
Fr what i heard  the lowest a slacker actually will get is C,btohqsg
The story sounds confusing ngl…he wun be talking about 88.75 vs 90 rp if it is yi/mi…and also an elite school wun hv slackers as described,btohqsg

But for the collapse part why didn’t they let that person retake? I thought it’s out of their control,btohqsg
She got hospitalised also I think,btohqsg
I’m surprised the sch didn’t cover,btohqsg
That’s why  ppl who get like close to raw 20 but insist on taking a levels instead of poly should just go to MI instead,btohqsg
what if they live east tho,btohqsg
Is it worth the travel time,btohqsg
Idk then  but if they rly want to take a levels having a sch is still better than doing everything private,btohqsg
But they could also consider retaking some o level subs so they can gain entry into a better tier jc,btohqsg
Jae system allows you to combine 2 years worth of o level results,btohqsg
Lowkey cringing rn at Minecraft rp videos,btohqsg
where the guy has a face cam,btohqsg
and he is js reading the lines,btohqsg

Combine? If you mean take two 🕑 levels and they take the higher marks of both  yes,btohqsg
It's no different than taking a o level subject as a Na and taking the same subject in sec 5,btohqsg
Your report book will reflect the best grade of both instance,btohqsg
But what if i took vhinese in sec 3,btohqsg
Wait until you realise  how much it cost your parents for you to go through another full year just to retake o levels,btohqsg

O levels retaking is also reserved for people who fail particular subjects,btohqsg
So you want to improve your Mt grade  from your last score?,btohqsg
I took chinese in sec 3 and i yook the rest in sec 4,btohqsg
Iw retake some subjects will iy invlude my chinese,btohqsg
You can register as a private candidate what,btohqsg

Idk maybe i can do better in o lvls,btohqsg
And go like jp or smth,btohqsg
The Jae system will take the best subject grade for each subject if you retake a particular subject (but only for within 2 sittings),btohqsg
