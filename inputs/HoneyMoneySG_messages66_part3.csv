Hi! I applied for an ocbc 360 savings account and I received a rejection letter but no reason was given. I went down to the ocbc branch and they were unable to help me open the account / find out why my application was rejected. Anyone knows why my application would be rejected or what I can do now? The customer officer at the ocbc branch told me I can consider applying for uob or posb savings accounts instead??,btohqsg
Did you try opening online? Maybe can retry at the branch,btohqsg

My 5.8% ndp credit very fast  like 2 days after 30 days end,btohqsg
They will credit the gap to 5.8%   not to add with 5.8%,btohqsg
If 26 or below  SC JumpStart also can.If it's your only acc  Trust Bank isn't recommended. There seems to be issues with some fund transfers that's still happening.,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know which app to use with credit card for paying Hawker food using SG QR code?,btohqsg
Im set up my uob credit card giro and hsbc said the direct debit is approved on 31/07/2023. However upon checking with uob  they said not yet set up. Any senpai here can advise how to resolve this?,btohqsg
When did you submit the form? Usually it take 3-4 months for the whole process to complete.,btohqsg
17 july sent 31 july received sms from hsbc that it is approved,btohqsg
U send to HSBC or uob?,btohqsg
Did you scan a copy of your form? If yes  then use that to contact UOB.,btohqsg
Nope sadly  used live chat to ask them to check on this have big spending so trying my luck if i can get it resolve before next billing cycle,btohqsg
Check your latest statement if there is a giro word printed on the form.,btohqsg
I have an approval for dbs one on 20Jul and is already direct debit this month le. So im thinking shud be uob side is the slow one,btohqsg
If not  then the only way is for you call uob hotline. Or perhaps get the scan copy from HSBC n re-send it to UOB.,btohqsg
Thanks. Am I able to use xnap when the hawker SG QR code have liquid pay logo?,btohqsg
Thanks. Mine like yours first one show direct debit and 2nd one didnt show anything. Hence curious and check with them,btohqsg
Thanks. Just curious beside xnap and shopback  any other good payment app that would be recommended for use to pay hawker food using SG QR?,btohqsg
For some reason crypto keeps in dropping for the past one year,btohqsg
Amex pay. The apps that can be used are printed below the SGQR logo.,btohqsg
Yeahhhh man I think end 2024 will be bull market?,btohqsg
One credit card one giro form. If you have two cards  you need to submit two giro forms if I remember correctly.If you only submitted one UOB GIRO form  only one of your UOB credit cards will be under GIRO payment. The other UOB card will be under manual payment.,btohqsg
Maybe. Crypto bull market always fast and furious when it happens,btohqsg
Do you invest in crypto ?,btohqsg
Yeaaa im aware of that. Thansk!,btohqsg
Even if the uob interbank giro form has space for 4x visa/mc and 2x amex cards? Need to submit separate forms?,btohqsg
Ok. Oic. The form u used is different from the one I used.And also provided you applied multiple cards at the same time.,btohqsg
Thanks. Would you guys recommend Alipay?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows how to be charged foreign currency on Taobao to earn the extra miles on credit card?,btohqsg
Evol thru Xnap is online or contactless spending please?,btohqsg
Your poems 5.8% credited and u saw they credit the difference? They allow us to topup more funds after day 1. So it is very difficult to calculate if what u said is true for poems.Because their customer service told me different story. He says their MMF fund can go down or up. And the 5.8% returns may up to 30 working days.,btohqsg
