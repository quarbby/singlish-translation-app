I haven’t used it on the entire car cause I lazy but I’ve been using it for spot touch ups on these fine scratches and light stains and it works really great,btohqsg
It's just strange that it's at the car door handle area and not around the whole car. Can it be so specific that the 'wind cut' velocity is so great around the door handles and not at other areas of the car? hmmm,btohqsg
I assume the main body of the car is designed aerodynamically so wind glides through it but for door handles  it protrudes out so it will “cut” the wind. And the recessed area probably creates a small whirlpool effect? I don’t know the physics behind how wind travels so that’s just my assumption on how I believe causes these scratches hahaha,btohqsg
I'm driving a Honda Fit GR (2020). It's not exactly that aerodynamic. lol,btohqsg
It’s a very common problem but an easy fix so I don’t think too much about it. You can try toothpaste for a more DIY approach! It seems to work just fine but I don’t know if it may affect the paint condition in the long run so I ended up using a proper car wax to remove them.,btohqsg
Next time I'll use microfiber cloth and toothpaste to try remove the micro scratches.,btohqsg
Watson got sell the soft99 ah,btohqsg
Recently my car got alot dirt stains cannot wash,btohqsg
pretty sure it's nails from ppl who use the door  and if we carry bags on our body it brush against it. that's why fine scratches at the door handle area.even if you seldom open the door  you still use it once in a while.if it's caused by debris and fine particles  pretty sure front bumper would have gotten it badly instead of door handle.,btohqsg
That's the issue  too many scratches to be from ppl cos I don't ferry ppl that often to accumulate so much. Anyway  I'll just try the toothpaste 'fix' to see if it'll work the next round.,btohqsg
could have gotten those scratches from car wash too,btohqsg
it builds up over time.i seldom fetch ppl too. but i open it to put stuffs at backseat.starting to see scratches on mine too after 3yrs.,btohqsg

My original thinking is still why just around the handle area only? If car wash  won't it also apply to the whole car since they're using the same cloth/sponge to wash?,btohqsg
car wash they open your car to wipe inside.and petrol station car wash they always carry a pouch at the front. the zip always brushing agains the car  just nice at the height too.,btohqsg
Do you send it to automated car wash every now and then?,btohqsg
Do we have automated car wash in SG? Don't recall seeing any.,btohqsg
recently it's making a comeback.the spinning kind.,btohqsg
The car wash workers  I'm familiar with them  they don't have pouches. But the possibility of their nails scratching it when opening and closing is a possibility. Just that I wash at most once a fortnight if it's really dirty.,btohqsg
I was kinda expecting someone might mention it. lol,btohqsg
I see. It looks like battle scars from automated car wash to me. Check your c pillar as well. Those are common areas but you’ll probably need to shine light at it or view it from certain angles.,btohqsg
somehow or another sure will still open rear door.so over time the scratches will form.but just leave it will do  don't keep polishing down.cos everytime your remove the scratches  the clear coat is wearing down.,btohqsg
I can help them use! 🤭,btohqsg
I understand. So far I let it accumulate and I just return to the shop to have it polished (for free) while paying for a simple car wash (for their services). That's why I'm thinking of changing to a different type of coating next year when the time is right.,btohqsg
Yeah Im starting to see more upgraded to automated car washes hahaha,btohqsg
Honda paint is generally thinner so it is prone to scratches.,btohqsg
I'm using TitaniumSH coating. So the scratch should be on the coating or deep enough to go past the coating. Well  this was in my earlier post on the coating question. It's ok. I'll observe if it still appears when I use a different car protection coat next year.,btohqsg
Not sure how to answer. Original + patch (top up after 2 yrs) application?,btohqsg
I'm working in Ubi area  you need to recommend where it's located so we all know where to visit for those quick wash.,btohqsg
I dun neeed to recommend 😤😤 but yah,btohqsg
Someone in this car grp share to me HAHHAHAA,btohqsg
Wow  it's located somewhat deeper  out of usual road traffic. Nice  next time can drive there for wash after work.,btohqsg
There normally a queue during peak hours. Estimated at least 10min per car,btohqsg

U know where to find me.,btohqsg
