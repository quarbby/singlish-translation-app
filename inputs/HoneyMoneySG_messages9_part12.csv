But my stashaway is positiveSoo i think moderate risk portfolio selection was my downfall,btohqsg
Stashaway boasts 1.4 % or sthg but my own calculation is still abt 1.2%LolsEndowus is negative 10%,btohqsg
and endowus is their cash smart?,btohqsg
No endowus for me has two partsCash is cash smart in negativeSrs is portfolio core  moderate risk,btohqsg
The cash smart is single digit negativeThe srs portfolio core is double digit negativeSo my impression of endowus is going down lolsVsStashaway consistly single digit positive,btohqsg
Sigh so much for first venture into roboadvisors,btohqsg
Think endowus cash holds longer term instruments which were negatively affected by interest rate hike. Their core is in line with the rest of the market,btohqsg
Grabpay > Jipay still can earn grab points now right?,btohqsg

Any atm charges for these 2 bank?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre using it to pay legit bills on your other cards (and assuming they‚Äôre all miles cards) its an excellent idea as you‚Äôll be getting your cashback on top of miles.Even if you dont do that but do it the way u described  i see it as maximising the benefits that the gpmc gives you. Either way its a fantastic deal,btohqsg
Yes I agree. Just the 30k limit from grab is really not enough if use it to pay bills,btohqsg
And after this no more grab 1.2% or 2.0% also,btohqsg
