yes certainly  i heard some schools even got 100% distinction rate  when i told my cousin (from dhs) i got B  her reply was 'i tot everyone gets A for pw',btohqsg
Yea dhs has v high pw distinction rate because the pw hod was part of the team that created pw,btohqsg
i heard even ASR is 90%,btohqsg
TM not too bad  my batch was 46.7% but my parents complain even more after i got B lol,btohqsg
i think my class had 4 As,btohqsg
not sure about now  but my cousin told me dhs was 100% distinction rate,btohqsg
tbh the tp's pw chers much better than the mj's one,btohqsg
mj more science  tp more artsy,btohqsg
not 100% but very close. in fact hearsay the person who created pw teaches at dhs lol. literally create their own subject to pull up their own students but too bad now pw is pass/fail lol,btohqsg
@kohsyanand i know that guy lol,btohqsg
and we dont have dedicated pw dept,btohqsg
except for that guy  all the other pw teachers teach other subjs,btohqsg
time for every sch to create their own subjects to pull up their a-level results ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Pull up for what pass fail alrd,btohqsg
just make a subject that can be graded lor,btohqsg
tak boleh lah i got K+OH- for 3 years,btohqsg

tbh idk bc my pw overall was quite smooth like people did their shit,btohqsg
i was on the committee so i kinda helped create pw,btohqsg
his baby has been relegated to pass fail,btohqsg
Oh noðŸ˜­ but at least he's honest,btohqsg
the way he talks about pw is like talking about his kid,btohqsg
the baby will not listen to the father anyway,btohqsg
