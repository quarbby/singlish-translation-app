A person with no arms or legs,btohqsg
id rather be a nugget with limbs,btohqsg
i wonder how nick vuijcic lives his life as a limbless kid,btohqsg
I doubt he’s a kid anymore,btohqsg

So you meant “lived” not “lives”?,btohqsg
i know my grammar is bad oke,btohqsg
i live on the 12th floor,btohqsg
How is this relevant  good sir?,btohqsg
the place that i used to live in was in the 25th level  it has two floors so just imagine,btohqsg
whats the average age grp here,btohqsg

"Just wtf  calling people with no limbs ""nuggets"" is fucking derogatory",btohqsg
you won't even want to know how i learnt that that was the term used for them,btohqsg
i learnt it from the term nugget porn  while my friends and i were having a very nsfw coversation,btohqsg

yes  i understand what you mean. however I don't really believe that all things are purely right or wrong,btohqsg
and in sthis instance  i prefer to ignore gray areas,btohqsg
i don't see how age is relevant to the maturity of people  really,btohqsg
older > more experience > more mature,btohqsg
im not fighting  i just think this is an interesting thing to talk about,btohqsg
more experience doesnt mean more mature,btohqsg
Prefrontal cortex not fully developed cant exactly think maturely,btohqsg
older MIGHT mean more experience which MIGHT lead to increased maturity but IT IS NOT A GUARANTEE,btohqsg
if thats your point of view  i will respect it. However i do ot agree with it,btohqsg
