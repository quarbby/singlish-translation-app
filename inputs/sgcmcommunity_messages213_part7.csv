During my poly days I was dating a Malaysian girl. We drove up to Cameron highlands in her trusty Perodua Kancil  no problem. Pushed it even more to a gravel path up hill till water boiled in the radiator. After that we stopped for a while and turned back. The car is still around today. So driving a Cat A in Malaysia is no problem,btohqsg

Singapore is studying 2 new MRT lines for feasibility. They're tentatively called the Tengah Line and the Seletar Line.🚇 The Jurong Region Line will also be extended southwards to join the Circle Line and the Cross Island Line.https://str.sg/qBxR,btohqsg
Singapore rejects separate COE category for private-hire cars  but will further support taxi fleet growthThe allocation between private-hire cars and private cars is “best left to the market”  said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor.https://bt.sg/tp9ySingapore offers S$40 000 incentive for electric heavy vehicles; co-funds up to S$30 000 for chargers:https://bt.sg/aXQJ,btohqsg
Feb 25  they only make 6 and 8% of COE A and B,btohqsg
Read carefully: these percentages are “business-owned”Never say anything about individual owned?,btohqsg
This just shows gov doesn't really put that much importance to COE price increase. Honestly  the issue of high COE prices ie 100k+ prices does not affect the majority voting public. Give them CDC vouchers  cheaper utilities and groceries  enough already. That's the major fight.,btohqsg
