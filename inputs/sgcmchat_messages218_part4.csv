All love the same hobby but got harassing issue,btohqsg
Nothing to do than harass people,btohqsg
Nothing to do then can start think how to let more public accept car gathering culture,btohqsg

Anyone know where to get cheap Michelin tire  my car tire was punctured,btohqsg
Michelin anywhere isn't going to be very cheap either way,btohqsg
If you want to tide over until ur next proper tire change  just buy a pair of 2nd hand tires to replace the punctured + the one on the other side,btohqsg
cheap and michelin don't gel well.,btohqsg
if you're getting Primacys  those aren't cheap too ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Not sure need to check the car but itâ€™s just a regular sedan,btohqsg
i would say bridgestones are decent la,btohqsg
Saw the brand on the ruptured tire is Michelin and Iâ€™m assuming that I gotta get the exact same brand so that they can still service the car every year,btohqsg
Generally speaking if say u puncture front right tire for example  you just replace that tire + front left tire,btohqsg
one traffic light to the next you set a PB,btohqsg
If normal bnb sedan like corolla  just almost any tire will do,btohqsg
But I scared that if I donâ€™t get the exact same Michelin tire it came with they will refuse to service the car,btohqsg
I don't think that's how it works bro,btohqsg
Tire isn't part of car warranty,btohqsg
Its like u change your phone case they won't service your phone?,btohqsg
according to apple they'll sue you,btohqsg
Rim ya maybe  some car dealership are arse that way,btohqsg
I remember motor image sg u buy wrx  I heard u change rim = void warranty,btohqsg
are there stuff at millennial walk car park,btohqsg
still maintained by motorimage for quite awhile,btohqsg
Maybe they changed the policy later on,btohqsg
tbf they flip prata w.r.t their warranties,btohqsg
I heard it was damn basterd during the GDB-F/GRB days,btohqsg
