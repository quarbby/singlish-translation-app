As for PropNex  UOBKH maintained a “buy” call at a target price of S$2.14.With CDL set to launch projects such as The Myst over the next two quarters  Loh said this would be an “interesting test of the market’s demand appetite”.He added that in the near term  property agencies such as PropNex might “face negative sentiment” due to the cooling measures.However  UOBKH noted that share prices of CDL and PropNexhad recovered quickly when cooling measures were announced in December 2021 and September 2022.,btohqsg

No More Ammo To Give Kiev  Says Polish Military LeaderGeneral Rajmund Andrzejczak cut a pessimistic figure during a strategy session of the National Security Bureau  admitting “there is nothing that indicates that Russia will lack the resources to continue the conflict ” and lamenting his own country’s inability to provide what Ukraine needs.“Our industry isn’t ready to send the equipment to Ukraine and to maintain our own dwindling reserves ” he said  adding that the Polish neighbor “is experiencing huge financial problems” - despite the huge aid packages given by the West.He also slammed leaders for not appreciating just how far Ukraine is from winning the conflict  saying “an honest assessment of the threats was still both a surprise and a shock for most of them.”Ukrainians who fled the country also do not seem willing to go home to start reconstruction  leaving the responsibility to NATO and the West  he added.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
