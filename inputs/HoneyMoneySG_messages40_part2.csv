Hi guys  do y‚Äôall knw if for vat refund  will u write amaze card details or the linked bank card details better? Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg
So the idea is to deposit say $10k now and then withdraw $9k on 1st June while keeping 1k for the next four months at 0.05% before closing the account?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm a SC priority banking  I can earn 4% with minimum $100k and the above strategy still applies?,btohqsg
That  u have to ask sc priority agent.,btohqsg
Why not just leave your money there for 4 months' time to get all the interest? Shouldn't you lose more just for the additional 1%? I am just curious,btohqsg
If you merry go round you earn 5+ percent for your EGA for 1st and 3rd month  merry go round for EGA works as long as you have another high saving account,btohqsg
So does it mean that your 4 + % will apply to your 2nd and 4th month's time? So the overall interest received will be lower?,btohqsg
Do you earn miles for town council?,btohqsg
works only if there is another high interest account to transfer to in 2nd and 4th months. e.g. another ega account in your family,btohqsg
Yes. I ask the town council for their payee name and also their bank account number. I told them I need them urgently for citi pay all payment,btohqsg
Wah ok that is mind opening,btohqsg
I‚Äôm on hsbc revo and Uob EVOL,btohqsg
Coz if you have only one high savings account  the opportunity cost is much higher than you put in for all 4 months at 4.35% or 4.55%  depending on when you started your EGA ‚Ä¶ the extra 1% is capped at $300 per calendar month on incremental ADB on previous month anyway‚Ä¶,btohqsg
This extra 1% cap of $300 is it shared with the other EGA promo  e.g giro and credit card spend?,btohqsg
1% interest capped at $300  separately 1% rebate capped at $300,btohqsg

May i know what is the best way to pay for my prudential monthly fees to get cashback?,btohqsg
use maybank platinum visa card  fulfil the $300/$1000 card spend in each month of calendar quarter  get $30/$100 quarterly rebate. Play directly on ipay or auto deduct via pruaccess,btohqsg
Does the $300 spend include the premium? Cos i am paying $400+ a a month,btohqsg
Nice! Will have a look at the rest of the CC requirements. If its this good maybe i just need 1 card for most of my spendings,btohqsg
The 1% cashback for giro is only valid till 31 May? Beyond 31 May there is no cashback?,btohqsg
AIA does not accept visa for recurring. Any other cards for AIA Insurance?,btohqsg
Its valid for as long as you qualify for the Everyday+ Rewards program. Which is very easy.. Just transfer 2k in one chunk every month and do 5x transfers to non hsbc account.,btohqsg
Usually better to just use cardup or ipaymy provided the cashback or mpd is higher than the fees,btohqsg
Technically you need to do this every other month. Because once you qualify for it... Its valid till end of next month.But since that is unnecessarily another mental load....to avoid it...just do it every month.... Keep it simple,btohqsg
seeking advice what is the best way to pay for GE insurance annually ? TIA!,btohqsg
Does UOB EVOL qualify as $600 spend criteria and earn 0.3% cashback?,btohqsg
What is the transaction fee chargeable ?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  what does this mean?,btohqsg
I not sure . I use axs pay + earn 2.5% pay for insurance . The officer say only about 200 points earn for 1000$ insurance paid. Axs not qualify,btohqsg
That's why my friend advise me to go for citi pay all. You pay 1000$   you get 1000 miles. No cheat. Better than axs pay + earn  only 200 points earn,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hard for me to achieve the $800 min spend. Unless the $800 min spend covers all kinds of transaction including telco payment  insurance payment (I know they don‚Äôt entice cashback)? Or $800 only on dining and groceries ?,btohqsg
FYII just tried to pay for insurance using my remaining Balance in Grabpay wallet but i was denied from making payment and it seemed to be a new regulation where insurance company don't accept funds from grabpay wallet anymore,btohqsg
$800 on anything not excluded. Telco not excluded,btohqsg
yes  only can use transferrable balance in Grab to pay insurance.,btohqsg
Any idea what defines as transferable balance?,btohqsg
So telco can earn you cashback 0.25%?,btohqsg
topped up using debit card or bank,btohqsg
Using Citi Payall to pay taxes does not incur transaction fee?,btohqsg
If I did not hit minimum spend  then by default all eligible transactions earn 0.25%. Similarly for airfare or hotel bookings and electronics - 0.25%?,btohqsg
yes. though if I not confident of fulfilling the min spend I would have used other cards instead,btohqsg
Is bus/mrt transaction via samsung pay covered under exclusion? I didnt see simplygo under exclusion.,btohqsg
