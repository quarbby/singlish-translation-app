Hello  please help me out. I‚Äôm working for 4 years and my partner is going to ORD next month which opts us out of DIA. Fortunately we got a number for one of the bto but our loan amt is not much as it was based on one income. Will hdb give extra loan during key collection after taking in account his income?,btohqsg
If its HFE letter then cannot,btohqsg
U can try appealing though  subjected to HDB approval,btohqsg
I tried appealing for reassessment of loan but sadly got rejected and they ask me try for DIA but I know I‚Äôm not eligible :/,btohqsg
Sorry not applicable to BTO so I have deleted,btohqsg
they asked u to go for DIA even though you cant even meet the criteria?,btohqsg
Cos i was otp with hdb jn,btohqsg
But my appeal was unsuccessful cos both me and husb both not students or ns,btohqsg
They asked me to send some documents to see if I‚Äôm eligible,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt got back from them yet. But I know I‚Äôm not eligible,btohqsg
Just try appeal see if they allow,btohqsg
i see  the recent change to hfe makes everything so difficult,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not eligible as well but I still appealed and got my DIA approved today! üôèüèºüôèüèº,btohqsg
good news! Wondering which scenario you fall in? 1 working adult and 1 student?,btohqsg
When I applied for the HFE  my fianc√©e was still a full time student but now she‚Äôs already working full time. So can consider 1 working adult  1 student,btohqsg
So you were alr working more than 12 months?,btohqsg
I got a friend same situation as you. Got his DIA approved as well,btohqsg
So just try to appeal for DIA,btohqsg
Just hope HDB will approve itüôèüèºüôèüèº,btohqsg
ü•πso happy to hear all this! Yes hopefully!,btohqsg
Do we have to wait to be called to know if our DIA got approved or they will send email?,btohqsg
they will send an email to you,btohqsg
1 working adult and 1 NS?,btohqsg
I hope they make amendments to the DIA and our either/or instead of both.,btohqsg
Makes life so much easier haha,btohqsg
This is what I received from HDB today,btohqsg
Sorry  but they asked for CPF OA statement but I‚Äôm not sure how to retrieve it alone.,btohqsg
So I sent a SS of the page. Hahaha help pls.,btohqsg
For that they‚Äôll know how much your cpf is during flat selection.. I printed out my cpf statement etc but no use. The hdb officer didn‚Äôt even ask me for all of that,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been working 4 years and they wanna see how much I have in my cpf OA and they asked me send a statement of it through the feedback form to appeal for DIA.,btohqsg
If they asked you for that   just give it to them. For mine they asked for my graduation certificate,btohqsg
I graduated long ago but I just give it to them,btohqsg
They asked my graduation cert  cpf OA statement and my partners NS card and CPF OA,btohqsg
Yaaa what they want you just give. Makes it easier for them to process your DIA if eligible,btohqsg
Have any idea how to retrieve the CPF OA statement only? üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah submitted hahah waiting for reply but dk if I did the CPF OA part correctly,btohqsg
It shows your OA SA MA,btohqsg
Can choose from which month to which month,btohqsg
Btw how long did they take to reply you?,btohqsg
