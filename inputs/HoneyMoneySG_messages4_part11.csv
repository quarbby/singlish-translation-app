Pardon me  some qns to clarify:1) 1% Cashback given by EGA 1% should go to the EGA bank account right?2) Called HSBC  they said 1% Cashback from EGA is for giro paying utilities  Telco bills etc  not for payment of any credit card. Is this true or HSBC mistake?3) What's the Cashback limit of advance card with EGA? Still $70? Is yes  that means spending limit to enjoy 3.5% is $70/3.5%=$2000 only.,btohqsg
YesNot true. Got $4 back for $400 cc bill payment$2000 is the sweet spot,btohqsg
Btw please don't call bank and tell them about those hacks that work  this will just kill it,btohqsg
Think they also know. They just wait until more ppl subscribe to the card and kill it at later stages,btohqsg
Mine if i ask the cc bill payment can be for other banks' CC as well right? not only HSBC advance cc,btohqsg
Any one know what to will happen if CPF never reach BRS . Example reach 55 and Ra and SA combine only  have 90k what will happen?,btohqsg
YOu can still have payouts after you opt for payout at 65,btohqsg
and you still can withdraw 5k if you want too  which is not advisable unless you can reinvest at a higher rate,btohqsg
I mean eligible for CPF plan at a pro-rated?,btohqsg
amount of pro-ration suggest can just make a call  the officers can make an estimate at best,btohqsg
What I understand is if you hit 195k FRS and you start to draw out money from it every month 1350 at age 65 you will be in CPF life plan.  just touch wood if you happen to gone at 67 and will the rest of money return or it will go back to the CPF life pool?,btohqsg
not too sure on it  think you can check this questions seems like those in FAQ coverage,btohqsg
My understanding is you will not be enrolled into CPF Life but fall into the old plan,btohqsg
Maybe this situation is when most of your OA is locked up with housing. Scenario1) Sales of HDB  the proceeds will fall back to OA and then automatically transferred to RA to fill up the gap. Scenario2) Decide to do a cash housing refund  the process is the same as #1.,btohqsg
I have just paid my insurance premium via uob absolute > grab wallet > axs > income.Absolute give us 1.7% rebate in the following month statement.How do we earn the rebate from grab? Can anyone advice?,btohqsg
Regarding those CPF Life questions  you can ask in the 1M65 group instead. I haven't done much research on that because  it is a very long time later and policies might change by then for me. But those experts at 1M65 will have the answer,btohqsg
You don't earn Points for Insurance payment  so 1.7% is the max,btohqsg
Unless you want to play the UOB One game  5% cashback at 2% fee via ipaymy/Cardup = net 3% cashback,btohqsg
Thks Chris. 1.7% is better than nothing :)I am paying my annual premium. So uob don't work for me.,btohqsg
And grab only allow max 5k in the wallet  under the new govt policies.,btohqsg
You can split the payment to multiple 5k. Cap at 10k per month and 30k per year.,btohqsg
Yes I will have to do another payment tomorrow. Btw  grab allow us to top up to the nearest dollar... which mean i cannot top up my wallet to 5k if i have balance cents. ;),btohqsg
Haha Ikr. But I did 4950.,btohqsg
