but i eel like there isnt enough content for the impermeable surface part sia,btohqsg
Channel morph simply compare sediment regime discharge and human activities,btohqsg
affecting volume of flow is it,btohqsg
Climate affect discharge--> Urban heat island effectSediment regime --> lesser cause of more impermeable surfaces etcHuman activities --> channelisation of rivers to meet urban demands etc.,btohqsg
fml the UHI is so stretched,btohqsg
But u should still discuss discharge,btohqsg
i hope this doesnt come out,btohqsg
Cause it's explicitly in the syllabus document,btohqsg
im gonna make tis the h2 geog chat,btohqsg
sorry that i take an arts subjet which paper is in 7 days  clearly not as impt as others,btohqsg
Unless admins can come in here and explain how the content discussed in comparison to what other people have mentioned,btohqsg
maybe is just i take geog lol,btohqsg
EspecialLt cause its not the first time V went through and nuked all the content related discussion,btohqsg
once again  it's relevant  but it can very quickly evolve into chit chat. if y'all can keep it on topic  I don't mind.I agree with all the screenshots y'all sent that it's irrelevant  and if the mods are online we will take actionif y'all see such irrelevant content  you can ping us too,btohqsg
dyt enso will come out again,btohqsg
yea like the whole process + hadley and STHP\,btohqsg
one part a one part b,btohqsg
When the qn says GLOBAL ATMO CIRCULATION irs specifically abt hadley,btohqsg
if you want me to explain any moderation action taken or not taken  feel free to screenshot and send it here,btohqsg
delete alr how to take ss,btohqsg
Issokay there's way too many LOL like the olympiad talk,btohqsg
can ping me if it happens again,btohqsg
And people hedging all their responses with like mindless intros,btohqsg
"""I'm supposed to be studying for PW""",btohqsg
But let me do this for you,btohqsg
@Randkmdkdx4@chemcerFor the record  these are the ones other than the pure chat messages I deleted; the questions you claim I deleted aren't in there,btohqsg
ok so ure saying the fact that i stated that the content that was tested last year,btohqsg
is not releavnt to a levels,btohqsg
tell me geo9morph and tropical climate is not on the syllabus doc,btohqsg
and i will stfu for good.,btohqsg
find on the 9751 syllabus doc rn,btohqsg
unless the matter of fact im taking another a levels,btohqsg
tell me how the hell it isnt relevant,btohqsg
I would just like clarification as to why when an admin previously asks qns unrelated to a levels stuff those don't get deleted but suddenly it gets deletedUnless they playing moral high ground la. Last time when I was answering qns also in the o level chat I also got muted lol,btohqsg
so flooding hydro and climate is not related to a levels too?,btohqsg
Then why did huixin have to reask the qn here,btohqsg
oh so my tys is a lie la,btohqsg
Channel this anger into studying ur h2 geog,btohqsg
fluvial is not in a levelsb is it,btohqsg
is it just cause i take h2 geog,btohqsg
come out and say smth la,btohqsg
oh i dont know maybe its,btohqsg
repeated in my syllabus doc for 4 times /,btohqsg
mayybe i analyse every question in the past years to guess whats onna come out for p1?,btohqsg
That’s because V is not going to share the screenshots where randkmdkd sent messages about h2 geog content and explanations which he deleted. Why would V want to implicate himself for a mistake on his end? Of course he will only produce the evidence that supports his claims to try and cover up those messages that he deleted which he shouldn’t have. Can’t expect him to be unbiased,btohqsg
Gurl focus on ur h2 geog I doubt ur gonna get any satisfying answer,btohqsg
bro he has offically triggered all my anger,btohqsg
im sitting in the lb smashing my keyboard,btohqsg
Ok so this is not a level stuff is it,btohqsg
Nah I feel like this just turns the discussion into he say she say lolI think the fact that we were having a fruitful discussion about specific content but those got nuked so we had to pivot here is alr telling enough,btohqsg
