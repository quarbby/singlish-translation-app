But not ones i want play,btohqsg
just that all the games I play I either buy or pirate liao,btohqsg
wa how many docs u have sia,btohqsg
Or do the boomer way. Take out quarter page advertisement in Straits Times classifieds. Then cut it out and staple together with your application.,btohqsg
which is abit less than 2048kb (2mb),btohqsg
Bruhh i 17 files only 1.8mb,btohqsg
Means u fucking up la HAHA,btohqsg
maybe u wanna try using a proper scanner,btohqsg
which is why Iâ€™m asking rightâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. hahaha,btohqsg
Actually i grow to like this type of game leh,btohqsg
If u lazy u can use camscanner on ur phone to take pics of ur documents,btohqsg
also when u zip the file i think it compresses it too,btohqsg
I got a wheel gear shifter and clutch,btohqsg
I have 50+ hours sunk into it,btohqsg
no choice bring out and get scanning service,btohqsg
at least 70 hours into xplane,btohqsg
Then black and white  compress  should be fine.,btohqsg
how u have so many files one,btohqsg
me just one file for cca one file for results,btohqsg
Eh u shd is damn shiok LOL,btohqsg
anw 17 files is a shit load,btohqsg
If I buy wheel and pedals and gear and everything,btohqsg
I might as well get an iracing subscription aso,btohqsg
Den u wont leave the house ah,btohqsg
Eh racing games r fun LOL,btohqsg
And very few manual cars alr,btohqsg
me poor peasant never think o fcar,btohqsg
Or NUS oam email got deleted,btohqsg
is just the two thingys at the side,btohqsg
smh then just get like a full racing sim at home,btohqsg
I got my free driving lessons in ns,btohqsg
now considering whether to take manual or auto,btohqsg
Den once i get rich off computing i buy a honda civic type R,btohqsg
Anyone going out later? We can go play PokÃ©mon Go. We gym battle,btohqsg
If u enjoy what u dng,btohqsg
just second gear all the way,btohqsg
Yah but u learn manual dont need learn auto what,btohqsg
Den just take the manual test lor,btohqsg
today all talk about something else le,btohqsg
look at what we talking about,btohqsg
Auto dont even need use brain,btohqsg
u stuck at ystd chat ah,btohqsg

Uphill shag if use engine brrak to stop the car,btohqsg
Go manual up some of those super tiny,btohqsg
i used to army jeep alr,btohqsg
outside car engine nt so stronk,btohqsg
isit true that any small alteration will get u charged,btohqsg
U dun scared lor. Just ram,btohqsg
after i finished saf driving sch,btohqsg
Fix her problem alr or not,btohqsg
I heard got some thing detect speed limit or smth,btohqsg
basically drive auto jeeps all the way,btohqsg
The former scholarship girl you mean. Sheâ€™s now doing TikToks,btohqsg
go over small bit then kena charge,btohqsg
so it effectively has no speed limit,btohqsg
so those jeeps can go 100,btohqsg
aka the speed limiter wont beep 10 times,btohqsg
if it beeps 10x itll record,btohqsg
TikTok egirl make lots of money de. Got premium Snapchat. And Telegroups,btohqsg
so lets say it beeps a few times  its a signal to lower ur speed,btohqsg
usually jeeps have a limit of 60km/h,btohqsg
then thrs some troller jeeps with engine issue,btohqsg
Jeeps can corner high speed bro,btohqsg
(eh actually does anyone know if SCDF will pick ppl who alr have license to be driver),btohqsg
No need drop gear. Just corner sua,btohqsg
or some damn stupid jeeps thats auto  but it doesnt change gear by itself,btohqsg
saf driving sch teaches u to turn gear 1,btohqsg
How you end up there sia? You Malay?,btohqsg
does my profile picture or name sound Malay to u,btohqsg
Then how you end up SCDF?,btohqsg
I heard SPF got more than SCDF,btohqsg
i only heard airforce dont have,btohqsg
You got go dAngdut KTV with the regulars or not?,btohqsg
My mono intake no malay leh,btohqsg
Wah rabak. If your upbringing only hang out with Chinese  you guarantee culture shock,btohqsg
wa what kind of mono is that,btohqsg
The best of the SAF mono,btohqsg
Like you think itâ€™s ok lah you will adapt. But really no. If your upbringing is mono-ethnicity one  you will rabz bro.,btohqsg
cant rly go in with lower clearance,btohqsg
Your first day you will question why CMPB so anti-you. Why you one of few to go SCDF,btohqsg
yall got the dunking one als9,btohqsg
But at least now they control the ragging culture. Last time the weak really kena rag siol in basic training,btohqsg
more money and doing smth more meaningful than slugging a gun through a forest,btohqsg
Then later when you meet your friends on weekends you will feel left out they share army (aka real Singaporean NS) stories,btohqsg
so SCDF/SPF not real Singaporean NS la,btohqsg
Youâ€™re not. You have to go through it. Will rabak rabak.,btohqsg
so only SAF real NS la,btohqsg
who are u to tell me what part of life I'm at?,btohqsg
that's sure as hell the impression that that guy's giving me,btohqsg
U havent serve ns is it,btohqsg
I tell u u ord no one give a fuck alr,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the impression your friends will give you. You know itâ€™s not true. But they will either ignore you. Or tell you army more tough. You will slowly learn to tune out,btohqsg
But bobian la got some elemnt of truth,btohqsg
Den when they talk army u wont unds,btohqsg
So thats the issue my friends from other servcie face,btohqsg
I alr gone through denial for that,btohqsg
so I think I'll be fine,btohqsg
So  found a way to compress?,btohqsg
Then during basic training  good chance you will no friends one IF (I emphasize IF) youâ€™re the type of upper Sinkie who only hang out with own race type.,btohqsg
if I got use I won't be in Singapore alr,btohqsg
Just know that u r a useless lowlife,btohqsg
U r the most expandable person,btohqsg
idk why u telling me this,btohqsg
If you don't mind risking your personal information  you can send the files to me and I'll see if I can try something,btohqsg
Dont care la just enjoy NS,btohqsg
Well at most if I try anything funny I only get charged with COMPUTER MISUSE ACT,btohqsg
No lol u will be more uselss now,btohqsg
Anyway I trying this  running script now,btohqsg
They tell u fk off dont implicate the org,btohqsg
the docs are too personal I think :((,btohqsg
Hard Truths bro. I know I damn cb to say this. I got friends who went through the same.Maybe I totally off base,btohqsg
you're totally off base to the audience you're trying to convince,btohqsg
Lol then learn how to usehttps://github.com/pts/pdfsizeoptSo far seems not too bad,btohqsg
and go do smth else with your time,btohqsg
I tell u u will miss NS one,btohqsg
people keep telling me I'll miss sch,btohqsg
I'll take uni life over ns,btohqsg
no legit HAHA 3 years on I still don't miss sec sch,btohqsg
Life is shit if youâ€™re in NS training and your squad no friend friend with you,btohqsg
it's been 4 months and I don't miss MI either,btohqsg
Other than that life is good,btohqsg
This is because you didn't get a life where you can 8-5  sleep from 9-11:30  go lunch  sleep again from 1-4  prep bookout at 5,btohqsg
yah that was my life sia,btohqsg
i was so bored of stay out,btohqsg
so i can eat steamboat etc,btohqsg
Train hard and do the REAL NS,btohqsg
Which was not my life btw,btohqsg
u storeman or u cdo also same,btohqsg
Sit in police car drive around. Look for coffeeshop to dabao food,btohqsg
aite I'm gonna ask u to stop with your real NS shit,btohqsg
we don't need people here preaching that some particular part of something is better than everything else,btohqsg
Then after dabao food  go to police post to eat. Then lie down in rest area for a while to relax,btohqsg
Then drive around again. Look for another coffeeshop to buy teh and snacks. Then go back NPC to relax a bit and settle paperwork.,btohqsg
Then by then can knock off liao,btohqsg
No preaching bro. I just sharing knowledge. But soon when you enlist you will gain your own knowledge which you may or may not share.,btohqsg
I respect all. Whether do NS. Or donâ€™t do NS,btohqsg
ns only get it done with and gtfo,btohqsg
Poly application to uni ended right,btohqsg
Serve and F off. And then once a year serve and F off again. Repeat another 9 times,btohqsg
u earn 20k a month. they wont call u back,btohqsg
I heard this is n o p e for MO. And also the commander-level at reservist lol,btohqsg
YeahðŸ˜° I ended up rescanning everything on Adobe Scan and compressing it using Acrobat,btohqsg
mine was a bit more simple,btohqsg
so everything use acrobat can do,btohqsg
jz scan with scanner  then compress,btohqsg
Dk why this wasnt working after so many tries,btohqsg
Scholarship good luck! Now time to make TiKTok,btohqsg
Yeah I used so many apps but acrobat worked best,btohqsg
once compressed into a zip file size may differ,btohqsg
hhh just now jay say he got 17 file,btohqsg
Good luck hope u get the performing arts onr,btohqsg
Cos probably no need 90rp for it,btohqsg
I think 90rp is useless if someone sucks at interviews anyways,btohqsg
but of course there are many ppl  who are good at interviews and also have 90rp,btohqsg
Thats if u can even get to the interview HAHA,btohqsg
But they filter 90rp even if u r toastmaster international,btohqsg
yeah but having a pessimistic attitude and spreading negative vibes is no good too >:((,btohqsg
? No ah im being truthful,btohqsg
How come pointing out the truth = negative vibes LOL,btohqsg
Who ask u never get 90rp,btohqsg
Does 90 equate to straight As (4H2  gp),btohqsg
But its a damn useless certificate lol,btohqsg
It judges the most useless metric which is test taking/academic ability,btohqsg
eh i think the harsh truth is correct,btohqsg
no 90rp no talk is generally true,btohqsg
from poly equals no chance also true,btohqsg
No 90rp no talk at uni level HAHA,btohqsg
is ok. no scholarship also wont die,btohqsg
get bursary or pay in full,btohqsg
If i was a girl ill just do tiktok,btohqsg
So many ppl pay u just to dance,btohqsg
just do it only. degree going to help in the long run also,btohqsg
But free noney is alwaya good,btohqsg
ya la but no need å¼ºæ±‚,btohqsg
dont have then dont have is ok one,btohqsg
as in 30k doesnt make u suddenly better than other ppl,btohqsg
I think right jc ppl shd learn to take Ls,btohqsg
Thats the one skill that is such a big deficit among jc educated ppl,btohqsg
30k small money only. over the long run its nothing,btohqsg
A lot of JC ppl cannot take Ls,btohqsg
Can u imagine determining ur life potential at 18,btohqsg
Ur words will go unheard cos its not PC,btohqsg
And many ppl in JC leech on this broken system,btohqsg
So no one is gng to rock the boat,btohqsg
Den u can rock the boat,btohqsg
gng to have our baby soon,btohqsg
Oh no! You could get pregnant!,btohqsg
Nice. Got cert to have baby liao?,btohqsg
Need baby cert. Adult need adult cert. Elderly need elderly cert. Dead needs death cert.,btohqsg
Ya cert is to certify status  not get permission to die or to live,btohqsg
Hence no need to have cert to have baby  just need cert to certify baby exist,btohqsg
Anyone wanna do lunch in west?,btohqsg

You start ah. Can become the owner of the group. I follower only,btohqsg
Yah true. Sorry if too much NS talk here. Will move it to another geoup,btohqsg
Due to the coronavirus  hospitals are asking that all illness activities stop until further notice.Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in the matter.,btohqsg
Due to the coronavirus  MOE is asking for school to be stopped untill further notice.Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in the matter.,btohqsg
I canâ€™t tell if you think itâ€™s serious,btohqsg

Due to the coronavirus  coronavirus is asking for all life to be stopped until further notice.Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in the matter.,btohqsg
Due to the coronavirus  school is asking for school to be stopped until further notice.Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in the matter.,btohqsg

Due to the coronavirus  coronavirus is asking for all toilet paper to not be stocked until further notice.Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in the matter.,btohqsg
Do you all even know why ppl buy toilet paper?,btohqsg
Using list comprehension to create a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 divisible by 3 Other thanmylist=[ ]for x in range (1 51) :if x%3==0:mylist.append (x)Then mylist is it possible can put the condition in the append (x) bracket like append (x if x%3==0) or smth or cannot,btohqsg
mylist = [i for i in range(1  51) if i % 3 == 0],btohqsg
>>> [i for i in range(1  51) if i % 3 == 0][3  6  9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36  39  42  45  48],btohqsg
it's nice being a snek hiss,btohqsg
Are u doing the easy python changes on google,btohqsg
That one wont prepare u for actual cs mods in uni  unless you learning it for fun,btohqsg
You might want to seek help for other questions at PyDiscord,btohqsg
Well it does prepare for the 1010 variants... like the first few weeks i guess,btohqsg
With extreme implications  can just further shorten to[i for i in range(1  51) if not i % 3]And in this case since only int(0) is the only falsey int  it should be fine.,btohqsg
Nope I am doing python on udemy only at the beginning part,btohqsg
it gives a false sense of confidence imo,btohqsg
Idk if i can even get in hahaha,btohqsg
It really depends on how well you can measure coding ability,btohqsg
if ur rp is above or equal to 85 u can ba,btohqsg
theres always a 2nd major option in nus,btohqsg
Wat can meh my rp damn low for cs leh,btohqsg
Even if you don't get in CS,btohqsg
You'll likely do it as part of other STEM courses,btohqsg
declaring a 2nd major in uni is independent of a lvl performance,btohqsg
they will look at ur cap instead in uni,btohqsg
AFAIK Math you need particle swarm optimization,btohqsg
Engineering  can do anything from FEM  circuit simulation  MatLab (another bullshit by itself) etc,btohqsg
I am trying for the other universities(like other than nus smu ntu) as well no reply yet so see how,btohqsg
If you do social science it might be good to understand what you can do with coding anyway - don't make ridiculous claims like solving NP-hard problems 'easily',btohqsg
u rly like cs ah 0.0,btohqsg
but nus is the only uni that u can customise ur 2nd major,btohqsg
other local unis dont allow for that,btohqsg
Alr got accepted by sutd but idw accept,btohqsg
Trying to get a second major for Lit,btohqsg
Partly because idw start uni so soon n i will have to move out sooner,btohqsg
I rather start early than take a gap yearBut either option has their own benefits/cons,btohqsg
I mean sutd starts in May,btohqsg
Anyone received a call from SMU tdy?,btohqsg
You must really like pastries and cakes,btohqsg
Nope. I like choco and nuts,btohqsg
U put pastries and cakes in there twice,btohqsg
Sigh  don't have my favourite snack,btohqsg

You can scramble these eggs anytime ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Or they hates it. Trying to dilute the vote for pastries and cakes.,btohqsg

thereafter  the singapore equity index fell from 351 to currently at 280 ish,btohqsg
i actually feel the GS guy is correct,btohqsg

it was a timed practice  so i collected it at the end,btohqsg
Now you know  what you need do and what you don't need do hahaha,btohqsg
i taught him a new chapter at y2 which he managed to grasp after 2-3 weeks,btohqsg
so now idk what to do :/,btohqsg
No need timing la. Just give him some MCQs and then give him 2 hours to finish. Relax. Collect money,btohqsg
aiya if liddat i might as well just sleep during lesson,btohqsg

Goh Chok Tong. Maven of Marine Parade,btohqsg
Thanks :) I will need it,btohqsg
Give him structured questions. But instead of the original marks awarded  you triple it. So a normal 2 mark question becomes worth 6 marks. Make him write more for even simple questions,btohqsg
hes already performing at a much higher lvl than his peers,btohqsg
idw to make it any higher,btohqsg
hes sec 1 equivalent this year,btohqsg
doing quite well for sec 3 topics covered,btohqsg
You teach him what subject anyway ah?,btohqsg
Y u bully small children teach h3 chem to sec 1 kid,btohqsg
i january started teaching him  then by end feb I alr finished his school's year 1 syllabus,btohqsg
Raise him to be the monster you know he can be,btohqsg
doesnt mean they are good in science LOL,btohqsg
i remember him struggling in chem bonding,btohqsg
yeah and then i become irrelevant :(,btohqsg
By the end of the year he will be teaching you,btohqsg
Pass on your legacy to him,btohqsg
i will teach him molecular orbital theory!!!,btohqsg
He will be teaching you plankâ€™s equation and schroedingerâ€™s law,btohqsg
- -jay why u switch to chem from cs,btohqsg
tbh for the easy cap maintenance,btohqsg
i wanted to do both chem and cs anyway,btohqsg
figured that if i stay in cs and i cant maintain a high cap I cant 2nd major chem,btohqsg
tbh i wanted that  but not rly aiming for that anymore,btohqsg
chem and 2nd maj in cs?,btohqsg
There are courses you canâ€™t go to?,btohqsg
its not even offered locally to begin with,btohqsg
comp chem is a very niche area anyway,btohqsg
comp bio and physics quite pop,btohqsg
Comp Chem to me sounds like C + quantum chem,btohqsg
idw to provide unnecessary stress either anyway,btohqsg
the parent was also scared when I taught him mole concept the start of this month,btohqsg
HAHA but dont lie to yourself becoming irrelevant is your no.1 concern HAHA,btohqsg
so i decided to piss off  cos i hate physics,btohqsg
i exhausted 105% of my resources,btohqsg
