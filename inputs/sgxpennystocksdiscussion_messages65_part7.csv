Morning All. Today MT long green candle.Why MT will have sustainable growth beyond 2021 - Part 2:In part 2 let us look at macro factors.Otside of China MT is the biggest PPE manufacturer with factories in Philippines  Cambodia. China and Taiwan. Philippines and Cambodia is where MT makes most of the high demand PPE.Philippines and Cambodia have tariff free entry to US and European markets. Trade barriers have stacked up against China to these markets off late and this is not going to change. Supply of poor quality and faulty Ppe from China has deteriorated image of quality coming out of China.There is more awareness of importance of Ppe. According to WHO and other experts Ppe is the one thing than has prevented Covid from further spread. There is increased awareness and demand in hospitals as well as countries to maintain a good stock pile of Ppe going forward.All these will add to sustainable growth for MT.I think of MT as the Top Glove in PPE industry (non glove). Given the current price of MT it is like buying a share of TG for 75 cents.All this is facts with my interpretation added. Always do your own fact check and decide for yourself. Your money your decision.,btohqsg

I am expecting 2 possible scenario. Punch up to test $0.090 resistance sooner or later (range for a while first). But if sentiments good and price maintain $0.080. Believe it shall be soon. Wait for a $0.081 or $0.082 close or any positive announcements and can expect rally to come. Evidently  BBs are inside and they have collected a chunk.,btohqsg
