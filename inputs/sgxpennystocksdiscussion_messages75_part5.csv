I heard someone mention JT today got announcement early this week...there must have been news,btohqsg
Oh JT announcement still not out yet?,btohqsg
The thing is people keep saying there is news  but when asked them what news  no one can give an answer..,btohqsg
i am quietly confident about the news  at worst neutral news,btohqsg
At least something to look forward during the weekend   other than epl,btohqsg
like what I said in earlier posts  I v scared of China company halted.. so far  most of cases are bad news.. latest being SunMoon.. if no announcement now  login mon morning to check again.. if monday morning still no news  then potentially will be bad news..,btohqsg
today first day. third day is tuesso by wed morn they sure have to announce somethingbe it halt extension  news or suspensionjust giving a timeline dont stress,btohqsg

NAV 44 100 mil1.98% = 873mil krw = $1.04milbased on today's price  they probably holding at least 780 lots?,btohqsg
He just invested? Maybe his ep was below $1,btohqsg
but based on current share price and the 1.98% of NAV  only works out to be around 780lots,btohqsg
Omg!! Never thought of this angle!,btohqsg
Ok maybe also  if based on current valued 1.98% @ $1.04mil and 1 170 000 shares  his EP is $0.88,btohqsg
Your üò≠has turn into üòÉ.U hit the jackpot. üëç,btohqsg
Report dated 13Oct. If have holding power  grab ThaiBev early & hold 3-5mths. $0.9 seems too high but $0.72 is a good possibility before Mar21. Based on the ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù closing last evening  Monday gap up looks certain. Monitor to believe. üôÇ,btohqsg
Hope JT over the weekend have some news out,btohqsg
Thanks bro! Also looking to scoop some,btohqsg
Believe it is super good news so dont be anxious üòáüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Someone mentioned that halted counter from China usually means bad news! I‚Äôm paranoid now!,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople!Weekend Reflection Quotes  :1) We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.- Jim Rohn2) We don‚Äôt have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest-W.BHave a blessed Weekend with the Family! Next week should be a good week to trade.Enjoy üëç,btohqsg
üòÅ. We can take note of one impt factor on ThaiBev. This stocks very few players will contra cos the price fluctuation usually quite slow & minimum.Based on the past few days  BBs have tested the market & realized it‚Äôs difficult to force much investors to sell at below $0.58. (Those that did sold off due to panic already gone from the picture). Yesterday time & sales records more or less indicated it‚Äôs mostly BBs themselves selling & buying back between 0.565/0.57 to accumulate as much as possible. But right before closing  they scooped back all 0.57/0.575 to bring up the price back to 0.58.Monday or coming week  the price will continue to up. If it does drops after u get some  just hold on to the stocks. Good results awaits in the near future.,btohqsg
Thanks! I was waiting to scoop even lower actually until it went back up before closing.,btohqsg
For long.. good hedge against medical too..I think there's some ipo potential too for one of their division?,btohqsg
That I do not know. üòÅ,btohqsg
I just googled to check. .yeah there was plan to spin off beer division n ipo in sgx..but seems covid delayed the plans...so let's see...when and where n how...,btohqsg

I believe in everything  there is Full Blown Justice in the matter of Time!If they are good reasons to support your belief and determination  act it out! Otherwise take it as a lesson and move on ;) have a blessed weekend everyone.,btohqsg
If only the number 1.98 is the price that they are holding lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Can medtecs go up to 1.98?,btohqsg
Why not?! There is always possibilities ! In this case 1.98 is % ... anyway good to know this stock is vested by bb,btohqsg
From ytd's action  not impossible üí™,btohqsg
They buy all the good potential stock,btohqsg
Interesting to know they buy into which exchange!,btohqsg
Actually medtecs is making good profit but shares price is much lower than UG healthcare  before UG spilt it shares to 1 for 3.Also there is no any analysis report for TP for medtecs whereas UG healthcare had serveral analysis TP for it.Make no sense,btohqsg
Can I ask If a company transfer all it shares to another of their subsidiary  does it mean that all the shares we had invested in this company no more? Or will be transferred ya?,btohqsg
Hopefully retailers no panic anyhow sell then price can push up to cross $2,btohqsg
It started to be speculative stock due to cheap price and Super good financial performance over very short period of time  there is a transition towards the place where the share price Harmonise with actual performance! Until then  the stock will be too expensive and  risky for contrarians and shortists. It is this transition that will make many retailers give up and repeat the vicious cycle,btohqsg
I cSo medtecs price can't go up,btohqsg
Well yes and no  it depends on the maturity and  of the retail investors   is a supply and demand game. If it is true my a Good stock  seller don‚Äôt want to sell  buyer will bid higher to get the stock in view of Company growth. It is the holding power of the retail investors that play a vital part whether it goes up or down,btohqsg
There is a lot psychological game at play in stock market,btohqsg
There is supply and no demand actually,btohqsg
