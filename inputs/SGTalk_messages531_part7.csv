Real.dont come in packet need to grind the beans,btohqsg
Real civet beans has a caramel like taste and aroma .,btohqsg
oh. the one I bought is grinded powder sealed in a packet. got it when I went Bali last or was it last last year,btohqsg
so whats the poo smell like?,btohqsg
scary. I only see red flags,btohqsg
High chance is fake . A good Civet coffee is full-bodied  quite heavy and full in the cup  and perhaps even a bit syrupy. Civet coffee has a pleasant sweetness that may reveal hints of chocolate and a subtle caramel taste.,btohqsg
Nice where you buy de? I want also haha,btohqsg
Go to the nearest neighborhood cat  lift it up and smell it's ass for poo smell reference,btohqsg
Civet are related to mongoose and not cats,btohqsg
Poo smell won't have much difference,btohqsg
