wow so you're willing to sacrifice your grade for her?,btohqsg
then the next sem comes  the relation of content to the previous sem is like 10 to 20%?,btohqsg
once again depends on your module,btohqsg
Oh u talking about poly is it,btohqsg
also jae kids don't go np,btohqsg
I just passed by that hahahha,btohqsg
actually refrain is the better word,btohqsg
You doing fine with your subjects?,btohqsg
(jk I wish I can die sometimes),btohqsg
Not in the moment but am using Dec Holi to brush ip,btohqsg
Looking down on people who decided not to take that combination?,btohqsg
Good  manage your time wisely  take things slow but progressive!,btohqsg
it's not me against people that didn't take that combi,btohqsg
Eh at least I'm good at econs,btohqsg
yes sirrr  can gimme Ur mi notes so idh to buy,btohqsg
When I say iw to persue econs deg,btohqsg
Who cares? As long as you are comfortable with yourself  that's good enough :),btohqsg
oh it's ok next time at uni can do more,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume I'm persuing a chem degree,btohqsg
Oh  that's fine  Economics philosophy is much more fun than the actual calculation haha,btohqsg
It's still quite general and flexible,btohqsg
There's always a bigger market outside in the world,btohqsg
you gotta know how to leverage the skills you learn depending on what you wanna apply for,btohqsg
You create a demand and supply to that demand  there will be a job for sure,btohqsg
Application of skills is way more important than just memorising theoretical knowledge as you grow into an adult,btohqsg
It is LOL  the teachers don't even go thru what was taught back in y1 or y2 if u make it to y3  it's so much self-directed learning and I mean at least I find there's alot at stakes,btohqsg
Unless you deadass just want to be a paperwork academic  then I give it to you,btohqsg
hmm at least sci not that bad bath,btohqsg
but like for my class after sem 1,btohqsg
poly and jc are just very diff systems,btohqsg
they all just group tgt and die tgt,btohqsg
hard to compare side by side,btohqsg
jc is like sec sch style on steroids  poly is closer to uni but toned down,btohqsg
that's kinda how i see it ba,btohqsg
hmm i see it kinda the opposite,btohqsg
better to fuck up in jc then poly,btohqsg
unless u mess up damn bad in jc then have to come poly lol,btohqsg
you have 1.5 years to fuck up in jc  just don't fuck up the last part,btohqsg
if u wanna mess around there were some people who go jc first,btohqsg
yeh but poly is 6 sems of constant effort,btohqsg
it really depends on what kind of system you thrive better in ba,btohqsg
It's also hard to play catch up,btohqsg
i never caught up in the end,btohqsg
I believe in consistent efforts la,btohqsg
Have a ex classmate of mine going thru that rn,btohqsg
Like I honestly think just say JC or poly easier is actually dumb,btohqsg
me too but i also believe in optimising last min cramming,btohqsg
i got through uni decently well through being last min,btohqsg
like it can be done if you know what you're doing,btohqsg
I mean that seems pretty extreme,btohqsg
