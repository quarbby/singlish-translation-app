Pika World Update July 14 2021Market PulseThe equity market took the CPI data with a pinch of salt as Nasdaq perform relatively calm. However  the re-opening trades and small caps appear to take a hit as investors rotate back to value growth stocks that provide visible market growth coupled with a profitable stream of income.On the Asia side  Singapore registered a robust economic growth where the economy rose by 14.3% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Nonetheless  the outlook remains volatile despite a high vaccination rate globally.Inflation is getting warmerConsumer prices continued their surge in June and had risen faster and higher than what most economists had expected since August 2008. The CPI rose 0.9% in June from the May period. On a year-on-year basis  it had jumped 5.4% after rising 5% last month.In particular  the prices of used cars and trucks rose sharply  increasing by 10.5% in June. This continues as a chip shortage continued to haunt the sector as it crimps supply despite a booming demand. It accounts for more than a third of the CPI increase.Price pressures seem broad too. For example  the food index rose 0.8%  and energy prices gained 1.5%. This shows inflationary pressure appears to be broadening out. However  Pika World maintains the expectation that a tipping point is visible in the next quarter.Gentle Meme Stock: Nokia is coming strongAn update for Nokia comes with good news. First  the stock continued its ascent as the Finnish telecommunication group plans to increase the full-year guidance. This is part of the well-grounded progress seen in their three-phased plan to reach sustainable growth. Moreover  the company had a robust cost control coupled with a glowing strength in their end markets.Banks earnings are good on a thin iceThe latest earning from banks such as JPMorgan Chase shows that businesses results are still firm  and the bank topped Wall Street estimates. While there is a sharp drop in fixed-income trading from the year ago  as Pika World had expected  it is partly due to the surge in trading due to the economic effects of the Covid pandemic.Pika World continues to explore opportunities for mild accumulation in the sector.China: The cut in RRR may not be a rosy pictureThe unexpected cut in the broad-based RRR (Reserve Requirement Ratio) that is effective July 15 may not be a good signal on the health of China’s economy. However  the cut is likely to help banks lessen the burden on their capital and liquidity requirements and lower the cost of their lending business.This gives some uneasiness as it could also imply a possibility of banks having more significant bad loans. These bad loans can be a by-product of the deleveraging reform where banks no longer lend much to the real estate developers as they shrunk their mortgage business. In addition  Fintechs lending has also slowed down in part of the reform.Therefore  banks could move into micro-lending  a void left by fintech  but it is proven to be a risky business. While there is room to breathe  Pika World believes the RRR cut is just a temporary relief  given that the liquidity release in this episode is minimal compared to the banks’ outstanding loan.What’s on the menu today?It will be another critical day.At 8.30 pm  we will receive PPI data which we expect to be at 0.6%  a moderation from 0.8% in the prior period.At 12 am  we will welcome Uncle Powell testifying  and it could shed light on the Fed’s tapering action insights.It is July 14  Tuesday  at 8.40 am in Singapore. Pika World wishes everyone a cooling day and a splendid mid-week.If you find the content in this broadcast useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us build a resilient ecosystem.,btohqsg
