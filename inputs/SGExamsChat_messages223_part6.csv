okay mine was to like allow us to tap into sch so,btohqsg
but like theres a small process to get ur card into student again,btohqsg
if i remember its sch handle,btohqsg
i remember i had to go tap it at the top up machine?,btohqsg
what do ppl think of subject based banding?,btohqsg
Well  given that I was the last batch before the pilot programme was launched  I can see that my juniors benefit much from it.,btohqsg
They mentioned how they garner much from the subjects which they are better suited for.,btohqsg
like ppl who are originally from na nt mixing with express kids,btohqsg
Personal experience of mixing with students from such an initiative I think its ok tbh. Only problem is there may be a divide  and the teacher may be slightly biased against them.,btohqsg
like instead of having nt na classes separate,btohqsg
divide as in the express ppl dont rly mix with the na nt ppl,btohqsg
like got 1 class i taught out of 40 ppl  only 2 were from na,btohqsg
and in general students from nt who are not so motivated to do well academically  by mixing with express kids  perhaps they get positively influenced,btohqsg
so your form class  has a mixture of academic abilities,btohqsg
instead of previously where all nt is one class  all na is one class  all express is one class,btohqsg
sbb just basically only affects the class for that particular subject,btohqsg
so for example class A has 40 students and all of them take pure chem,btohqsg
so form class still consists of all na/nt/express students?,btohqsg
but for their pure chem class there may be 2 NA students joining them,btohqsg
that's not how my sch works now though,btohqsg
for the sec sch i interned in  it was like that,btohqsg
it's legit a mixture of express  na  and nt kids,btohqsg
i guess each school has their own implementation,btohqsg
my sec sch did it that way too,btohqsg
like half my class take g2 level  then half takes g3,btohqsg
this is for sec 1s ah,btohqsg
then for their lessons they go to separate classrooms?,btohqsg
so instead of having like 5 express classes  3 na classes and 1 nt class per cohort,btohqsg
now we have 9 classes with mixed abilities,btohqsg
hows syllabus compared to h2 math,btohqsg
Im planning to replace chem for fmath,btohqsg
does it sync with h2 math or what,btohqsg
hows the jump frm h2 math to h2 fm?,btohqsg
so maybe for a class of 40  20 is express  16 is na level  4 is nt level,btohqsg
how many schools are trying out this SBB thing uh,btohqsg
oh then rolled out to all sec sch in 2024,btohqsg
I think what you and Jay experience is non full sbb,btohqsg
now my school is full sbb,btohqsg
so maybe that's why like that,btohqsg
Huh since when tm bans bcme?,btohqsg
Bcme is the most basic combi,btohqsg
ya true  under the old pilot program must have been like that,btohqsg
Cant be one of the top sec sch in sg do sbb weirdly,btohqsg
Bcme is the sidekick of pcme,btohqsg
every JC's cop has a chance of increasing by 1,btohqsg
So i guess is different methods,btohqsg
no yours should be the non full sbb,btohqsg
Just seeing the 50 organic reactions makes me want to look away,btohqsg
cos my sec 2/3/4 also same as yours,btohqsg
some na students take express subjects,btohqsg
