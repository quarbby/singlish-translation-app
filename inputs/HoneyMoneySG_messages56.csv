Re: UOB Ladys cardGuys which category should I use for online purchases?,btohqsg
how do i check what categories i chose? can't remember,btohqsg

I think GXS daily transfer limit is max $15k. Need to keep in mind if need to transfer to other banks,btohqsg
Dang  these categories are annoying..Thinking to apply UOB one + lady's card  but I don't spend $500 for just 1 category.. should I get another UOB cc for the other spendings?What's the strategy now guys?,btohqsg
Changed to $100k daily limit already.,btohqsg
u see if uob evol suit u better?,btohqsg
oh  but I only can set max $15k..,btohqsg
Should be just changed today lol. See the update date.,btohqsg

Try tomorrow loh. Maybe changed today. System need run batch run to take effect tomorrow?,btohqsg
Hmm maybe yes  UOB evol for online purchases + simply go transport and Lady's card for dining categories,btohqsg
ok  note that uob evol need min $600 monthly,btohqsg
What time does GXS bank give us the interest daily?,btohqsg
Just open an account few mins ago b4 12am,btohqsg
Can open GXS account not from using Dash app or not link to my Dash account ?,btohqsg
I just downloaded the app and created my acc using singpass today,btohqsg
Your account immediately got approved? No need to wait for review and approval ???,btohqsg

Immediately. Sign up from grab app. Saw the news abt an hour ago,btohqsg
Oh. I signup using the GXS app. No wonder it says need to review,btohqsg
Why now then sign up gxs?,btohqsg
Is GXS now insured by SDIC up to $100k?,btohqsg
Same leh  but mine was instantly approved after review  not sure whats happening on your end.,btohqsg
"Just found it funny if you want to sign up for an account on GXS on web they will prompt you to ""download"" it  sending you to a Apple Play Store website üòÇ",btohqsg
Recently government proposal to increase to 100k not official yet?,btohqsg
Govt very busy lah where got time to make this official,btohqsg
I download the apps just now n setup up  the account was created instantly using SingPass. I can transfer money from my bank account to GXS account immediately. Super fast n easy.,btohqsg
Think shld be under MAS work scope ba....,btohqsg
Which is a better instrument now then? GXS or moomoo cash plus?,btohqsg
no its grab x singtelthats why G X S,btohqsg
If it's credited everyday does it mean that the effective int rate is higher than 3.47%?,btohqsg
Haha that‚Äôs really how the name came about?,btohqsg

Makes sense tho lol. GXS only has one floor in grab 1 north HQ. Same building,btohqsg
hi can I ask which credit card allow me to do credit as a salary and earn interest and rewards at the same time?,btohqsg
3.48 on 75k and daily interest?,btohqsg
"I shared this promo to someone. The other person did not go to the ""promotions"" page at all. Deposited 10k and subscribed 5x2k. Did not receive notification of successful egilibility (while i did). So we contacted moomoo. They say need to withdraw the money and do all over again (i recalled cannot cos need to put additional 10k since the last 10k is registered in system alrdy). So we did as instructed. It didnt work. My friend did not want to put additional 10k just to test the system so end up gave up on this promo",btohqsg
When i sign up for gxs savings account  i will end up with main account only? Then i need to separate create the pocket? Why need to ask users to do extra step. Or is there other tnc for the pocket,btohqsg
Create new savings pocket and move the money in,btohqsg
75k deposit at 3.48%  roughly $7+ interest per day?,btohqsg
Strange. Why nobody interested in RHB 3.5%savingFD interest? But aim at 3.48%,btohqsg
Morning!!GXS got min deposit for 3.48%?,btohqsg
okay.. bo $ now lol. stuck in last year FD,btohqsg
In this season where SPY is on the bull  would you invest $10K in 6 months T bill while waitIng for another low for entry into SPY?,btohqsg
also need to think of your strategy on when to sell. don't just think of when to buy.,btohqsg
if you only think about when to buy  you will be stuck with your existing holdings when another  low comes  and then you wondering why you bought so early.,btohqsg
so the first question you need to ask yourself is: are you planning to trade short term or hold long term?,btohqsg
Its like u can have different pots to grow. Something like saving for big ticket items - travel / medical / dining,btohqsg
Like to ask is anyone having early critical illness insurance plan?I.e Paying $600 to $1k per annum. No cash payout upon maturity.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advice if the citi pay all If I max the 95% credit limit  and clear it and do another transaction to the max of 95% credit limit again  will that be possible?Meaning haven statement date yet,btohqsg
I believe cannot. It is by calendar month regardless if you have prepay or not. Means 95% of your permanent credit limit in a calendar month  not statement month.,btohqsg
So with this is it still worth to use if I burst it and pay the admin fee to get the 1.2md,btohqsg
Don't get ur qn? If u burst limit the transaction won't even go thru,btohqsg
Which means I clear the amount I used and do a smaller amount within the same calendar month,btohqsg
Is it worth the 1.2md if I am on premier miles and since there is a charge of 2.2%,btohqsg
Don't think it works alr mentioned in abv t and c posted. If limit 1k u can only do 95% max which is 950 on payall for that calendar mth. Any amt after can won't go through for that month even if u alr paid that 950 u used initially. Not sure but that's ehat I understand frm the t and c,btohqsg
Burst means you cannot use Citi Payall at all.You need to wait till 01 Aug 2023.,btohqsg
Any recommendations of online bank/bank that give better interest? Other than GXS Mari and trust.Looking for risk free and better liquidity  at least can withdraw when needed  not like fix deposit üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è,btohqsg
If I already UOB one acc  should i shift my funds to GXS? I see the hype in it but the interest seems lower than UOB one?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 if withdraw money and MAB compare to last month is $499.99 or less will loss 1.2%/2.4%/EIR1.5% interest.,btohqsg
Why shift? If have extra then shift extra over,btohqsg
I see suddenly gxs so hyped  so wanted to clarify if there are other aspects of it that makes it a better deal. Thanks!,btohqsg
Uob or OCBC if fully funded then go gxs,btohqsg
Uob is like playing elden ring...have to complete all the side quests and make perfect choices just to get the best ending.GXS is like animal crossing...no stress,btohqsg
Gxs ya jist put and forgettingUob is mich More lor $$ to earn so u nee do More homework and keeping track,btohqsg
hi im asking for recommendations.. I have uob 1 and ocbc 360 both salary credited. i spend more than 500. I have citi cash plus... should I cancel citi and get ocbc90n? since I want to collect miles üò•,btohqsg
maybe spend on uob lady to get 6mpd and clock to uob one account $500 spend for bonus interest?,btohqsg
I also sign up with GXS app but approved instantly,btohqsg
put 100k into UOB one and OCBC first.,btohqsg
What about the Uob Stash account? Will it be better than GXS?,btohqsg
Stash only 3% effective I think and it's not compounded. Weaker interest rate than gxs,btohqsg
Stash account cannot take out money. The moment  u withdraw 1$  become 0.05%,btohqsg
UOB stash account is a 50% FD (Flexible deposit). You are only allow to increase account balance to continue earning interest but not allow to reduce the balance(even if reduce by $0.01). Reducing balance will result you lossalmost allyour interest you supposed to earn.,btohqsg
hi  is there still the sign-up bonus of 2 500 Grab Points simply by linking GXS account?,btohqsg
We're not stopping there! We're giving away a ton of Grab and Dash reward points.To score extra reward points  simply maintain an average balance of S$500 in your Main Account of your GXS Savings Account and spend on eligible transactions on Grab and/or Singtel Dash with GXS between 19 July and 31 August 2023.,btohqsg
Now more troublesome to earn the bonus,btohqsg
wah i long time never hear grab points liao i thought this thing no more liao,btohqsg
Got notification for successful eligibility? I did the whole step and never received any in-app notification. But I called the hotline and the CSO said I should be eligible.,btohqsg
Same  but have not all cso  do you see the daily dividend?,btohqsg
Which card should I get for one motoring road tax payment ?,btohqsg
Uob absolute amex via paypal for road tax,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie  just to check for uob absolute Amex card via PayPal method  does it also work for other platforms ? Like insurance or any transaction that goes thru PayPal?,btohqsg
If there is paypal as payment option u can use uob absolute for those mcc that is usually excluded for rewards,btohqsg
I see  thank you so much for the tips. Appreciate it üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Grab limk to gxs and deduct from gxs or top up via gxs ?,btohqsg
Is there a fee charge by PayPal,btohqsg
Was previously under review as well after signing up since yesterday.Wat i juz tried was tat i downloaded the app  and sign up again using another device.In the another device  GXS prompt me login using myinfo etc  and immediately gave an instant approval wif acct number etc.Then i logoff  and re-login my old device.Its working for me already.,btohqsg
Does any one knows what card i can earn miles with for veterinary clinic / vet services? I have a dog that needs surgery and it's a big amount.,btohqsg
Don't think got other above 1.2MPD for vet services,btohqsg
I don't mind 1.2 miles also. At least its something.,btohqsg
Remember to pair with amaze though  though you should work out how much u will earn through this against a general spend card like Citi PM (i.e. if your bills exceed 1K),btohqsg
but amaze got no points for local spending right?,btohqsg
I will ask if I could split the bill into 2 payments. So 1K will definitely be 4mpd. Others will be 1.2 miles provided vet services is under whitelist of citi premiermiles,btohqsg
no point  but will be marked as online (so u get 4mpd out of it),btohqsg
It's to convert it to online spending,btohqsg
I have around $200k in SSB is it wise to shift it into GXS since it has higher interest?,btohqsg
or is gxs shady üòÄ? dwna get rugged like ftx,btohqsg
ah? GXS max $75k? Then u keep $125k in ssb?,btohqsg
They are being regulated by MAS la. And there‚Äôs SDIC protection too,btohqsg
Don't wanna jinxed it otherwise famous last words. At least got insurance protection up to $75kcmiiw,btohqsg
I think u can split and use uob vs for pay wave 2k 4mpd also and uob ppv 1110,btohqsg
Ah but no max limit on how much i can leave in it right?,btohqsg
3.48% only applies to max 75k,btohqsg
U want to put more than 75k also cannot lol,btohqsg
isn't this meaning different  the max in the account you can have is 75k but interest earned will also be earn the same interest,btohqsg
I still read it as what I meant but well I'm bad with understanding those I just use based on my previous experience on the 5k cap,btohqsg
Hi all  new to moomoo cash plus  i parked some money in Fullerton fund yesterday  may i know around what time daily they will deposit the interest?,btohqsg
This is wrong.Similar to 5k deposit cap  you can only deposit up to 75k. Interest will still be accumulated daily and the added in as part of the subsequent daily interest.,btohqsg
For 2023  Grab forecast loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization between $275 million and $325 million ,btohqsg

Hi guys  am new to this group! Was looking for help with regard to something that I can't seem to find the answer to online.Looking at the exclusions for credit card spending criterion and one of them is MCC 6051 (Non-Financial Institutions ‚Äì Foreign Currency  Non-Fiat Currency (for example:Cryptocurrency)  Money Orders (Not Money Transfer)  Account Funding (not Stored ValueLoad)  Travelers Cheques  and Debt Repayment)Does this mean any foreign currency spending with the card is excluded?,btohqsg

If it is $2000 in foreign currency n mcc7032  you may want to explore DBS WWMC n Citi SMRT. I don‚Äôt have both cards. You need to do research on this two.,btohqsg
if cannot split  i'd suggest amaze + ocbc titanium,btohqsg
ah yes forget to mention  cannot split but is paid online,btohqsg
You need to use multiple cards because $2000 x 12 months = $24k.No Amaze on DBS MC card as it is excluded.There is a cap on rewards on Citi SMRT per year.I am not sure it works or not. You need to do research on this two.,btohqsg

the friend never do his own due diligence.. =.=,btohqsg
No leh  the agent is correct. It is expected return  not guaranteed returns. They never read carefully or they don't understand the terms. Should ask for translation  cannot suka suka. If suka suka  money bye-bye.,btohqsg
I only say basic things like currency not for investing.You still lose purchasing power over time.Tell him to go learn stock investing etc.,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt think so. 8k is the minimum combined spend if I‚Äôm not wrong.,btohqsg
thanks. So say I made a payment of $2k today and then another $10k  on 10 Aug. It will still earn that 2.2mpd right? just concern it will be outside some window period and my 2k did not count towards the promo,btohqsg
Yes. Must be before 20-Aug2k if was done today  will definitively count as long as you pay 2.2% fee and both 2k and 10k charged to the same card,btohqsg

I wanna buy (physical) fairprice vouchers for my mum on a monthly basis  where can I buy them from while still earning miles?,btohqsg
CRMC max $1k to earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
CIMB is one of the conservative banks that will regularly pull credit bureau data and enforce their internal cap of X times of your monthly income  even if you are above the MAS exemption income of $120k per annum.So when you apply for CIMB card  if they pull your credit bureau data and notice you already have outstandings above their internal threshold (sorry i don't know what that is)  you will not get any new facilities approved with CIMB.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know if using Amex ascend with card up will still get points?,btohqsg

U using to pay for ?,btohqsg
Will get the miles but u will paying high fees for the miles. So maybe if u value miles highly then cn go for it. For me I personally won't go for it haha,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 1.9% I think. And to get 1.2mpd not sure worth it anot hahaha,btohqsg
Yup 1.9 but u only get 1.2mpd so u paying 1.55 cents per mile. For me is quite high a price to pay. If ok for u cn go for it.,btohqsg
Max it out Liao. Hahaha cause it‚Äôs calendar month,btohqsg
Split payment ? Next mth max pay again. Or ask ur wife apply also lol,btohqsg
yes get 4mpd if paywave at fairprice/unity counter,btohqsg
Does Grab Food qualifies for 8% cash back on Citi Cash Back?,btohqsg
Why would u want to earn miles when there are 8 percent cashback card in the market. I buy 1k worth of ntuc at 1 go on citicashback card for my family spend  finish 1k then repeat again. Will have 80 dollar rebate next statement month,btohqsg
It depends on the individual person's valuation of a mile.if they value 1 mile = 2 cents for example  a 6 miles per dollar card would be equal to 12% cashback.,btohqsg
1 miles equal to 2 cent is too high valuation in my opinion  that is the ideal scenario but no the actual scenario. I have near 1m miles haha,btohqsg
Hi everyone  nice meeting you guys here. I am currently using Saxo as my brokerage but I realise they do charge a custodian fee of 0.12%  am thinking to switch to either Tiger or Moomoo or any other that you guys can recommend? I am not into trading so basically just own a few US stocks and will keep them for years. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
comparing recent inflated Revenue tickets  I would say 2 cents per mile is already rather conservative  but I'm just a beginner miles player..,btohqsg
Really? Unless its above 2 cents   usually i dont redeem,btohqsg
There is a few problem with miles chasing  is your spending enough to redeem the ticket within miles expiry  airline devalue miles all the time. If u compare economy to biz class redemption. U realise that often it is cheaper to pay for economy then redeem miles. Miles is only high value if u redeem biz class,btohqsg
Plus u often have to book way early to get good miles redemption deal for biz class saver,btohqsg
5 million hawker meals fully redeemed already?!,btohqsg
How much cash back can I get for 10 000 Citi Rewards Points?,btohqsg
Ya dbs $3 fully redeemed  i missed,btohqsg
No.I do not qualify.Or rather since I already have funds inside  if I withdraw and pump back in same amount   my net increase is $0.Need to increase net amount by at least $10k to trigger the coupon. The coupon will only apply to the net increase.So let‚Äôs say u rich. U have $100k inside. Then u top up $10k and get the 5.8% coupon. The coupon only applies to the $10k and not to the rest of the $100k inside before the top up.But let‚Äôs say u have $0 inside MooMoo before promo start and then u top up $10k. Then u would have increased net amount by $10k n get the coupon.So to me  this promo good for those that have no funds in MooMoo cash plus before the promo.If u already have  then it‚Äôs not so lucrative.My plan moving forward is if I want Fullerton cash fund  to buy from WeBull instead. They hardly have any cash fund promo. But MooMoo n Tiger regularly have. So it‚Äôs best to leave $0 in MooMoo/Tiger Fullerton cash fund and park it in WeBull Fullerton cash fund instead.  Then when MooMoo/Tiger have promo  then can withdraw from WeBull and participate. Then this is considered as fresh funds and also top up. Once promo over  transfer back to WeBull.Besides  WeBull redemption n withdrawal for cash fund is T+1 from my experience  unlike t+2 for moomoo/Tiger. So u get back $ faster and reduce opportunity cost lost while $ is in transit.,btohqsg
I haven't been active on moomoo so think I will try and see how it works.,btohqsg
Then yes  this promo is a must for u.5.8% guaranteed for 30 days. Don‚Äôt let it go to waste.NoteOnce u deposit and subscribe $10k  the 5.8% will be auto applied . U don‚Äôt need to manually select or redeem coupon.IMHO Just top up  up to $10-$30k for the lower tier coupon and if u have cash  top up $50k to $80k to maximise the higher tier,btohqsg
I also recently went to the MooFest2023 at Suntec and asked them the same question and they say that if I intent to take out and put back in below the net amount  then I won‚Äôt qualify.My heart died inside a bit but I put on fake smile and took their goodie bag. They got quite a lot of freebies.My only consolation is that because I went for the MooFest  I got $30 fund cash coupon and $30 stock cash coupon for just checking in at the venue  so at least I got that going for me. Got back $30 after 3 biz days for doing $5k top up.,btohqsg
Do I need to move $ to GXS saving pocket just to earn interest?,btohqsg
Which is more worthy usually when swipe foreign currency transaction ? Pay the Mastercard fees direct and earn boosted miles or link with amaze ?,btohqsg

Hi. Can I check  if I‚Äôll be spending almost 7.8k in 1 single transaction. Which card is the best for cash back / points etc?Currently I have citi cashback+,btohqsg
Hi. I‚Äôm buying a brompton bicycle from brompton junction @ Funan.They allow credit card. And cost is almost 7900.My citi cashback+ got cashback of 1.5%. So I‚Äôm checking if there‚Äôs any other card that has better cashback?,btohqsg
Oh. Ok I go check it out. U know where to buy? Carousell?,btohqsg
How do you know the $30 cash is credited to your acct? (Not credit the $30 coupon).,btohqsg
do u have SCB manhattan? It has 3% cashback for up to $6667,btohqsg
Hi. I don‚Äôt have. I maybe go see if I can apply.,btohqsg
This is the $30 fund cash coupon I got from MooFest2023. I justdeposit $5k and subscribe into Fullerton Cash Fund. 3 biz days later I got $30 credited into my securities account which I then withdrew.,btohqsg
Yup carousell  look out for good review seller,btohqsg

Ok. Got it. Thanks.To get the $30 cash coupon for buying ETF. Any ETF recommendation?,btohqsg
I only used the $30 fund cash coupon. I haven‚Äôt use the stock cash coupon.To use the stock cash coupon u need to buy ETF worth at least $5k SGD leh.If u buy $4 999.99 SGD the coupon will be greyed out.I cannot recommend what ETF to buy  lol. I also don‚Äôt have $5k to 1 shot buy. Now markets all time high  u want to enter meh?,btohqsg
Fund cash coupon also $5k  right?I m searching which ETF will have relatively low risk to hold for 1 month. Not sure is there any ETF  which has underlining asset using cash fund  to invest.,btohqsg
nowadays can only use ecapitavouchers at retailer. Ecapitavouchers can only hold $1k. Not tested but think can buy eCapitavochers from Wogi then load and use $1k by $1k. Many cards rewards for online spend on Wogi https://heymax.ai/v2/search/wogi?useVisaApi=false&country=SG&paymentTags=,btohqsg
I think it will be difficult to find.1% of $5000 is $50.I‚Äôm sure u know that its easy for even broad based ETFs like VOO to move more than 1% a day in either direction.Consider risk reward carefully.I didn‚Äôt use the $30 stock cash coupon because if my ETF moves by more than 0.8-1% in a day negatively  even the $30 stock coupon won‚Äôt protect my capital.Q2 earnings are just only beginning and u can see the bloodshed yesterday.Maybe the more prudent thing to consider is the long term value of the ETF rather than just buying ETF to get the $30 after 3 days.So that I‚Äôm trying to say is that whatever etf u choose needs to have at least 3-5 consecutive days of earnings coz u won‚Äôt see the $30 until 3 biz days later. But if your etf drops by 0.8-1% for even 1 day while u are waiting  then u lose $ liao. This one is more like trader mindset. 3-5 days earning coz if u sell etf after that  u will new t+2 settlement and its opportunity cost lost.But if u long term investor then this $30 will help a bit to cover fees la haha.,btohqsg
I see. Ok thanks a lot. I‚Äôll go check it out too.,btohqsg
Usually I try to calculate the stock coupon can buy me how many days of losses before I use.For this $30 coupon  it can only protect my downside by 1 day. Then I held hostage by the 3 biz days waiting time for the coupon. Which I can potentially bleed more. So to me not worth it if I only holding for 3-5 days.Maybe your saving grace is that USD to SGD is weaker now. $1 usd buys $1.32 SGD.But even this spread won‚Äôt improve in just a few days .üëç,btohqsg

no need... but do u want to pay 3.5% fx fee?,btohqsg
Got it. Sometimes when I booked thru agoda it will default to the host country's currency. So to play safe just use amaze and link to lady's?,btohqsg
yes agoda is the one you MUST use Amaze + UOB Lady card and make sure you select PAYNOW to avoid sneaky FX markup/charges.even if Agoda is quoting SGD  if you don't use Amaze  you will get hit with 1% Cross Border Fee (SGD transaction processed in Hong Kong).,btohqsg
Very insightful...may as well all use amaze? So even though we use amaze uob will be smart enough to recognise the right category for the bonus mpd? Cause I read if use amaze it will be online payment category? Just want to make sure it's not categorise outside my bonus category,btohqsg
yes for UOB Lady  there appears to be no downside to keep tagging on to Amaze. Since UOB Lady uses MCC to recognise.The one that CANNOT be tagged on to Amaze all the time is UOB Krisflyer credit card as that one uses NAME RECOGNITION for certain categories.,btohqsg
the only time u CANNOT use amaze for UOB Lady is if you are applying a UOB coupon / taking part in a promo which requires you to use UOB card directly (e.g. UOB/SQ spend promos).,btohqsg

hi i just saw the video about amaze paring with citi rewards card  does it work well with local spends?,btohqsg
for local spends  amaze converts all transactions to online. Online earns 4mpd (except if it's on excluded list),btohqsg
ohh i see so it's still best to use the combo card either way?,btohqsg
then how does it compare to HSBC revolution?,btohqsg
HSBC revolution gives points that can be converted to 4mpd OR 2.5% cashback  on certain (but very relevant and common) categories. citi rewards + amaze gives 4 mpd unless its excluded MCC.,btohqsg
so citi reward + amaze would be a better choice?,btohqsg
or are they both good on their own terms?,btohqsg
citi reward exclude travel spending which HSBC gives 4mpd. You have to see what you want to spend on and what the card rewards/excludes  and find your answer,btohqsg
HSBC Revo n Citi Rewars+ Amaze complement each other.Best pair.,btohqsg

Yes. That‚Äôs for uob (disclaimer)  not sure abt the other banks,btohqsg
No for both. Interest will be credited and compounded.,btohqsg
you are right. so the actual interest is even higher when you let the interest and savings compound.,btohqsg
By allowing the full amount to accumulate interest on a daily basis in your Savings Pocket  you have the opportunity to earn an effective interest rate of more than 3.48% per annum on GXS.For example  keeping $1000 in a savings pocket without withdrawal of interest will earn you $35.40 of interest after 365 days.This is equivalent to 3.54% p.a.@gxssg,btohqsg
Did you switch on vpn when apply? If yes  try switch it off and try apply again.,btohqsg
I emailed them and they said overwhelmed so delayed,btohqsg
My wife and I applied for the GXS. She got the account approved immediately whereas mine is under processing,btohqsg
Same as my gf..she approved in less than 8 hrs and I am still pending,btohqsg
I just downloaded the app. And registered. Everything is settled and approved immediately in less than 5 mins.,btohqsg
Hi all. Is there a cap for the promotional interest rates for GXS?,btohqsg

Just ask your question and there will be ppl answering,btohqsg
Because now i am using my amaze card for local spend in SG  i notice when i took the public transport  the amaze card only charged $0.10 per trip,btohqsg

I have a few ideas- Make sure your app is downloaded from Google Play- Make sure your phone has a screen lock,btohqsg
I just started using my lady‚Äôs card (with dining as bonus category) together with Xnap. It should be able to capture the bonus miles right?,btohqsg
If I spent all 4mpd for my DBS WWMC  should I wait for 1 Aug?,btohqsg

Lady‚Äôs card is 1k on one category.Solitaire is 3k on two categories.U can google reviews about the cards.,btohqsg
Definitely  as long as you earn 120k/yr,btohqsg
Strange eh. The last resort is do a full wipe on your phone.,btohqsg
What phone is it? Maybe Android version too old?,btohqsg
Can check whether DBS Woman's World card  the online spending include *Travel Category*  like air ticket  hotels etc?,btohqsg

car can use credit card to buyü§î?,btohqsg
Mazda accepts Amex. BMW performance motets also accepts but got charges if use card,btohqsg
I am talking about second handed car dealers not directly from the car brand dealers,btohqsg
Sign up for AMEX Platinum  hit the 15k spend for sign up bonusCheck whether dealer accepts Amex first,btohqsg
Hi guys   If top up amaze wallet using mastercard got any fee?,btohqsg
One more question  if I am done with my Citi Prestige and do not wish to renew; what would be a good alternative premium general spending card? DBS Vantage?,btohqsg
Think every used car dealer is different. Shld be too expensive for car dealers. Fee 3%+,btohqsg
What do u look for in a 120k card?,btohqsg
ThankssinceI already have good high miles saving cards  I want a general spending card with no cap.(of course higher miles saving will be better),btohqsg
But u need to pay for the card though. Why not just UOB PRVI?Don‚Äôt think vantage got special sign upBonus nowThink UOB VI hasStill I think if you want a general spend card  just get those without annual fee/easily waived type. No point paying for a premium card if you don‚Äôt use the benefit,btohqsg
That's right maybe I should apply for amex card as I will already have other UOB cards,btohqsg
For a general miles card with no cap  uob privi is the highest with 1.4 mpd in $5 spending block,btohqsg
I wish there were mikes card fir CIMB,btohqsg
PRVI Is 1.4mpdSC I think only 1.2?PRVI need to spend in blocks of $5.But other details you can read yourself.,btohqsg
Occb travel 90n is 1.3 in 5 dollar block  but travel point earn does not expire and they have hotel partner too beside airline partner to redeem the point. No cap card too,btohqsg
Do I get any benefits if I declare myself as accredited investor? What are the products AI are commonly investing in now?,btohqsg
U get access to product that cant be offer to retail customer.,btohqsg
However always do your own research before handling money over to banker or financial adviser to invest in AI product. They earn commission definitely from sales but u bear the upside or downside of investment.AI product have higher minimum investment criteria as well between (100k to 250k) in one shot depending on type of product,btohqsg
The best advantage of AI customer is you have high net worth to do leverage with bank to do investment  this is great in low interest environment but now is on rising interest cycle  expensive to do leverage,btohqsg
Is shopback pay using scan qr code at merchant store considered online transaction? Will get points with citi rewards?,btohqsg

Start small start now. Know your basic expenses per month and plan,btohqsg
start by saving 10-20% for your monthly salary and not to spend unless needed,btohqsg
I use DBS Women World card for online flight and hotel booking for every 1 sgd 4 miles  cap at 2000 sgd per calendar month,btohqsg
YesBut beware that if you're using iPhone  make sure not use pay through Apple Pay. Link your card to Shopback app. Otherwise only 1x points,btohqsg
Yes. Beside saving and don't spent on wants.Start to learn skills that increase your income or learn investing. Learn valuation  how to read annual report  macro econ etc..... Alternatively if can learn how to trade short term.,btohqsg
Short term trade is deathly. Would not suggest on that,btohqsg
With such low income  should I even be thinking about investing?,btohqsg
Try to increase income first too.,btohqsg
First is no debt  save up emergency fund  after hit then allocate to monthly investment  their should be different fund basket to diversify risk,btohqsg
Depends on your character. Both my and queenie advice can.,btohqsg
I can give u a very simple scenario  u got a very good potential investment portfolio  but if u have not emergency fund. U will be force to liquidate if anything come up and u need money,btohqsg
I believe in singapore anyone can reach fire as long as their iq is average.,btohqsg
Alot of investment failed not because they not earning money  but because cashflow got stuck,btohqsg
U only invest what u have as extra not all in,btohqsg
It really not difficult to do it.I can do it so is everyone else. Long time ago already share before here. So won't repeat.,btohqsg
Sucess is being consistent in the result not fast and furious.,btohqsg
Buying macbook with uob one card  is there any cashback when buying online/at apple store?,btohqsg
No one can really help you  we can only advise.As per some people here suggestion.Step 1. Know you expenses. Record every crap that you spend on. How much money you have. You need to have eyes on your current situation before you fear the unknown/goals (bto/retirement),btohqsg
Use app or excel whatever. I personally use YNAB,btohqsg
- Have no more debt obligations- Have an emergency fund saved up- Have sufficient insurance coverageSeedly have a insurance Coverage Bingo you can refer on,btohqsg
If using uob one try apple store on shopee to get higher cashback,btohqsg
If u go apple store or online  u get max 3.33  if u go shopee apple store u get max 8.33 if u hit the quarterly criteria,btohqsg

you mean you just signed up via moneysmart or you asking him to sign up via moneysmart?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt get what u mean sorry,btohqsg
Yes I max my credit limit  but now need to pay more,btohqsg
Yea but now I hit my max limit and now it‚Äôs in unbilled  can I do payment for this unbilled so that I can have my max limit again?,btohqsg
cannot. limited to your fixed credit limit by Citibank. You can only increase it if you request for permanent credit limit. Paying your credit card bill early doesnt help.E.g. If my limit is 10k  I used 9k for payall. I cannot pay my Citibank credit card bill early to use another 9k for a new payall.I can request for permanent credit limit increase to 20k. Then i can use whatever extra limit i have for payall.,btohqsg
Qns: if I spend $400 on uob one for normal purchase  but then another 300 on shopee  I understand that now my total spend hits 500 for the 3.33 cb  but for the shopee trx  does the extra 5% count towards the whole 300$ or only the first $100,btohqsg

cos bonus interest only awarded to pockets not main,btohqsg
That's so inconvenient to use tho,btohqsg
If all else fails  just ask for transaction MCC  and whether it's online,btohqsg
yea  no choice lor. Need to live with the hassle to get bonus interest.,btohqsg

One card one account. So if you have two cards  you will need two accounts.Usually cannot stack for entry. The lounge will not allow you to use two accounts to sign in 3-4 pax,btohqsg

LiquidPay app only supports PayNow  the linking of CC via Google Pay or Apple Pay is only supported via XNAP app,btohqsg
You can use cardup or citi payall,btohqsg
Can i get more details pls,btohqsg
