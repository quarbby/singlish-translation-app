Hi friends  how do I check my HSBC points that can be converted to miles? I‚Äôve only been using HSBC revolution for 2 weeks. Or can I only see it if I pay for the yearly fee for converting miles,btohqsg
Have you enrolled into the mileage program?,btohqsg
Is it the one where you pay $40+ for unlimited miles conversions for a year?,btohqsg
Nope  so if I don‚Äôt enroll I don‚Äôt get to see it?,btohqsg
Unless u are just looking to see what are the points u have.You can see it in the hsbc app.Under your CC  you tap on View More,btohqsg
Oh the x9 points will only reflect the month after  I thought the points didn‚Äôt tally  but yea thanks for your help kind sir :),btohqsg

I got uob one card on 1 Nov  card approved on 27 Oct. I received the statement at 15 Nov with less than $500 due  meaning I won't hit the minimum.I assumed the statement date would be much later like 27th or 30th but abruptly cut off at 15th before I could spend $500.If I call CS to realign the statement month to calendar month  will it only take effect Dec? Any way to request statement to adjust so to clock $500 for Nov and Dec?,btohqsg
You can try on the UOB website online CS chat. But if you have received the statement already I don‚Äôt think you can adjust for Nov. Only December.Highly suggest using the online chat cos if you call in you wait damn long.,btohqsg
u can still clock $500 in the Dec statement to get prorated $16.67 quarterly rebatechange statement date will only take effect in Dec.Can try chat/call UOB to appeal. See if they allow u to make up the spending to get the $16.67 for Nov statement,btohqsg
Guess even getting the prorated $16.67 will require appealing and not guaranteed? Cos based on t&cs need to hit minimum spend for consecutive three months to be eligible for cashback,btohqsg
based on tnc  first quarter can prorate if met spend in last month or last 2 months of quarter,btohqsg
Depends on when u applied card too,btohqsg
Yeah and if the quarterly cashback is applicable to Dec only (16/11-15/12)  I still get bonus cashback for partner merchants right?,btohqsg
Hi can I check for uob evol  if I spend in ntuc and pay using the app linked to Apple Pay isit considered mobile contactless or online?,btohqsg

Hi Everyone  I'm withdrawing from Tiger Prime Account to DBS account and it's indicated that it should arrive in 1 working day. Previously with smaller amounts (around 10k mark)  my withdrawal request (iirc) + withdrawal fund remittance notice email from Tiger + fund credited in DBS was completed within the same day. Does anyone know...should I be expecting longer waiting times for larger amounts like 50 60k?,btohqsg
One Krisflyer account to One name. Though you may add redemption nominees if you have excess miles to redeem.But your concern seems to be not enough miles so you're trying to combine them for redemption  which does not work,btohqsg
Ahhh okay okay. Thanks a lot ü•π,btohqsg

If you use the app to pay via the QR code or whatever  your card pay the app  the app pay the merchant so become online payment.If you turn on your wallet  use the card directly to pay so your card pay directly to the merchant becomes mobile / contactless payment.,btohqsg
See Reddit or the previous messages for the workaround fix.,btohqsg

Hi all  how do i perform paynow salary from OCBC to UOB? Do i select paynow or local transfer? When i select paynow  i dont see a drop down menu for purpose of transfer as salary,btohqsg
"dun think ocbc has the salary payment as purpose anymore. Can do FAST from another bank  choose ""salary paymen"" from purpose dropdown list",btohqsg
Reminder for those existing accounts that registered for Nov'23 Bonus$aver Save Up Level up  need to fund by today (30 Nov 2023)https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/148419,btohqsg
Is FAST the same as Local transfer? If i use dbs to transfer to uob. Do i need to use computer or mobile app to make the transfer?,btohqsg
What are you guys' thoughts on buy now pay later schemes? Using atome  shopback  grabpay later or credit cards. How do i decide whether to use credit card or the other methods? Im holding onto dbs altitude  citi rewards  premiermiles and ocbc365 cards. Do any of these BNPL methods convert mcc? And would these count as online transactions too? Im also assuming the points/miles earned will occur whenever the installments are paid over few months?,btohqsg
can choose local transfer  then there is option whether transfer via fast  by default is fast. Can do on dbs website/app,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm looking at theIRAS rulesfor VCMA and I read this paragraph:As a self-employed person  if you wish to make (a) voluntary CPF contributions to your MediSave account under the CPF Board‚Äôs Self-Employed Scheme and/ or (b) cash top-ups to your MediSave account  you should check and comply with the CPF Board‚Äôs respective requirements and procedures for making (a) and/ or (b). This is so that the specific payment to your MediSave account that is intended to be (a) or (b)  is classified as such by the CPF Board.How do I make sure that the top-ups are classified under (b)? I am a fully SEP.,btohqsg
Kindly search the chat for previous dps about bnpl services.1. bnpl is reslly about cashflow. Or maybe you gonna bust your credit card caps (eg. I book a lot of hotels in a month  no more 1k on lady  so I pay using atome on citi rewards)2. yes unless credit card instalment but credit card instalment is not bnpl and also gets no rewards3. yes online but some dps say subsequent months not coded as online  so you should manually trigger4. yes,btohqsg
that's a very clever way to circumvent the CRMC exclusion for hotels,btohqsg
(a) is VCMA which you can do anytime this year(b) is SEP Mandatory MA  which is wait for NOA to finalize next year then CPF/IRAS will instruct you to do.This is assuming you are first year SEP,btohqsg
I see ok  actually I'm second year SEP but last year and this year I VC 37% of my NTI to all 3 accounts  so the MA portion of my VC exceeds the mandatory MA. The reason why I ask is that I wanted to do an additional $8k to my MA for tax relief purposes  but I kept poring through the IRAS docs and I realized that my tax relief for VC is capped at 37% of my NTI. Hence  I directed the $8k to my SA instead through RSTU. Not ideal  prefer to put in MA  but for tax relief purposes bopian.,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt have the card yet. But I will be going to Malaysia soon. So I can only use the Trust app. What is visa currency converter? Is it inside the Trust app? The officer told me Trust app only use SGD for transaction.,btohqsg
I remember you were asking if Tiger has Fullerton SGD cash daily historical returns  yes I found them for all 3 Tiger Webull and Moomoo,btohqsg
need a credit/debit card to make payment. Think he meant if u using the Trust credit/debit card overseas  the foreign spending will be converted to SGD based on Visa conversion rate.,btohqsg
This should be the Tiger one  but the 4.3% annualised shown daily will not give the dollar daily return as they are just there to indicate relative performance. The 7day return for 10k column is the one that should be used to calculate the prorated return for your principal.,btohqsg
and that one from moomoo or webull?,btohqsg
Oh  so I misunderstood.  Because in the video  I thought I saw some currency conversion screen   I thought the trust has that function. Ok  thanks. Then I guess I will get the Touch and go e Wallet. Thank you.,btohqsg

Trust Bank doesn‚Äôt have a multi currency wallet function like YouTrip or Revolut  but their conversion fees are damn good imo and better than YouTrip and Revolut in my overall experience.The rates are almost what you see on Google and unlike YouTrip  your money is not stuck inside because it‚Äôs just like a bank  can transfer in and out  paynow in and out to whoever etc.,btohqsg

Can be more than 1 time. They waived my GIRO fail fee (in the first place the GIRO shouldn't trigger  but that is another issue)  then I thought case closed.

wah shag..my UOB Stash account the MAB and the bonus interest..i wonder how they calculate..lolcan ask them to show me workings anot? haha,btohqsg
So using trust debit card to top TnG in ringgit?,btohqsg
Add all end of day balance of the month and divide by the number of days in the month. You can try to do it yourself.Or the safest way is to not withdraw from the stash account. Use it like what the name says  a stash.,btohqsg
yup.. didn't withdraw ..but keep snowballing..due to the bonus interest,btohqsg
So you're getting the bonus interest right? What's the amount you got?,btohqsg
how i press also i can't see this figure in my calculator..haha,btohqsg
I'm guessing you have about 75k inside?,btohqsg
100...but only deposited on 11 Nov...then no withdrawal nor deposit since..,btohqsg
Revolut  wise and youtrip all provide mid market rates for currency exchange. My experience is their conversion rates are excellent. Not sure why you opined trust bank is better than those,btohqsg
Weird... Hahaha the numbers are in between 17 and 18 days. If you never withdraw or deposit a single cent after the day you deposited the 100k as a lump sum  should have an accurate number.. maybe can ask cso üòÖ,btohqsg
"datz why lor..how i count also can't get their figure..hahahae-statement also not ready yet..but won't show their ""workings"" also i guesd",btohqsg
Minimally also should get 147.94 la.. üòÖ that's like 18 days if they don't count Nov 11..,btohqsg
How you count more? You counted 30 days? Another qn is  your account also freshly opened on Nov 11 right? Not before that.,btohqsg
oh shit..opened on 8..haha...so 3 days kosong,btohqsg
Okay calculated but what you got was still lower  so might need to check with CSO.23 days opened (8 to 30)  but only deposited 100k on 11 (so 20 days with 100k).MAB is about just a bit less than 87k.Your interest should be $148.26. So about $2.70 more than what you got.,btohqsg
Revolut rates are not as good during the weekends and MYR is not one of the currencies in the wallet so kinda cannot change money beforehand and keep it.YouTrip rates are great throughout but funds are stuck inside so I cannot empty out the wallet anytime I want to.Wise is the best out there with great rates but they impose a fee that lowers the overall exchange rate  in some cases making the rates worse than Revolut  YouTrip or iChange.I tend to go for Trust  mainly because the rates are  on average  acceptable with the flexibility of liquidity. These are just my opinions  no right  no wrong. üòÖ,btohqsg
To add on for Wise  certain balances can opt in for interest bearing‚Ä¶ so helps to offset fees too  which is amazing.,btohqsg
I consistently get excellent rates from Wise. Trust card being not a multi currency wallet is a mega disadvantage  because this means one cannot lock in the good exchange rates when they are available.,btohqsg
The key to using Wise  Revolut  Youtrip is not to treat them like bank accounts - so not advisable to keep large amts of funds inside,btohqsg
For my remaining funds in Youtrip  I simply use them to take public transport  go grocery shopping etc. its just like a loaded ezlink card,btohqsg
Hi  Did you receive the interest in two transactions? First transaction is the base interest 0.005% and 2nd transaction is the bonus interest?The $145.52 is for your bonus interest.,btohqsg
If you are setting up giro payment for your hsbc card to deduct from your EGA account  you can just contact them on chat in hsbc app and they will set up for you. For the rest  need to download the forms,btohqsg
True  being able to lock exchange rates when favourable is a massive advantage. Wise has almost every currency in the world as stored value  which is even better.While they charge a very small fee  in some cases  when including the fees as part of the cost  the overall exchange rate may not be good.,btohqsg
And must also keep track of large values  due to certain regulations and limits imposed by MAS. üòÖ,btohqsg
The main disadvantages are no perks  no points  no cashbacks etc‚Ä¶ for YouTrip and Wise  if I‚Äôm not wrong. Revolut gives cashbacks but they have a subscription fee model.,btohqsg

Hi all  current have CRMC (Amaze) + CPM. But my monthly spendings are over $1k now.Looking to get another specialised card. Would you guys suggest HSBC Revolution or UOB Lady‚Äôs? Taking sign on bonus  annual fees  transfer fees  and travel-spend eligibility into account‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I got HSBC Revolution as my Secondary Card. Since it's very versatile and covers most everyday spending  you can use it for food  shopee  department stalls  grab and plane tickets. Plus  there is no annual fee.UOB Lady gives higher miles (6MPD) but is way too restrictive. You will need to spend time to make sure that the shop is the correct MCC.Furthermorr  the 6MPD is a promotion and will revert back to 4MDP next year. The only scenario I think is useful is that you spend a big bulk on Food or on Air Tickets regularly.,btohqsg
I guess the downside to HSBC revolution is the high transfer fee?,btohqsg
What about UOB Lady‚Äôs vs UOB Privimiles?,btohqsg
Oh yes that's a downside haha,btohqsg
General question - any way we can purchase apple App Store credits for in app purchases from physical store?,btohqsg

u waited till end of next calendar month for bonus points to be credited? did paywave/online?,btohqsg
Personally  I don't think it's worth looking at Privi Miles unless you have super high monthly spend consistently.Spend | Lady | Privi$1000 | 6000 m | 1400m$5000 | 7600 m | 7000m$6000 | 8000 m | 8400m,btohqsg
I would say only consider Privi Miles after you have max out CRMC + HSBC + UOB Lady,btohqsg
Thanks! Haha hoping to get the $350 sign on bonus,btohqsg
I see! Cause they gave me points for my other spendings but didn‚Äôt give for that  I thought it didn‚Äôt go through hahaha. Thanks will wait till end of calendar month,btohqsg

Definitely don't withdraw.. you put in stash account is like you got extra cash that's why you stashing it one,btohqsg
ya not touching unless super emergency...but can withdraw it back too 100k..?,btohqsg
You need to withdraw what they credit on the day itself to make sure the MAB is 100k every month,btohqsg
Like now your MAB is higher than 100k already if they deposit yesterday and didn't withdraw.,btohqsg
Not worth losing the bonus interest next month to reset to 100k,btohqsg
jialad..in on Dec 1..i haven't withdraw..now the over 100k excess still inside,btohqsg
actually there are other savings account with better interest and flexibility to withdraw. No reason to use stash unless using it for uob savings promo,btohqsg
alamak..so just leave it first till Jan 1...then withdraw i think?,btohqsg
3% interest rate is really not worth racking your brains for,btohqsg
so far i only found UOB stash and CIMB fastsaver,btohqsg
Based on chat history you also using UOB One Account as your main current account right,btohqsg
That one also max out 100k right,btohqsg
Good to have a lot liquid money on hand but I think a lot of ppl will recommend to put some in tbills or mmf.. üòÖ at least no need rack your brain for just 3%,btohqsg

APA 3.0Pros1. Pure investment plan  your premium paid is purely for investment and fees.2. Decent welcome bonus (based on premium)3. Has additional bonus for longer term (based on premium)4. Good institutional funds invested5. Money just put in  no need think so muchCons:1. No sum assured (full investment plan)2. High fees for first 10 years (higher than other companies)  bonus cannot cover charges3. Invest ownself will be cheaper4. Welcome bonus varies a lot  depending on how much and how long you putting in5. No dividendsRecommendation:Decent for a no-fuss  long term (20 years). Not recommended if short (10 years) or mid (15 years) term or if you have decent knowledge in investing.,btohqsg

Thank u this is super good stuff!

(Bonuses cover the fees too) does it sound like this ‚Äúplan‚Äù will outweigh some of the cons?,btohqsg
If you need the money to be liquid then no  but if you can afford long term  and you want a fuss-free solution  it's decent. Other might also recommend long term ownself put s&p 500 / voo. But it's your choice üëçüèª,btohqsg

Problem with investing thru insurance companies is you can't stop the premium if something happens and surrender penalty is very high.,btohqsg
ya i doing this now..if all u can hit....up to $8k p.a (5k from one account and 3 from stash),btohqsg
hi friends  im just discovered this channel and watched all related videos on chris's yt channel  and wanna ask for yall's real life experience with uob evol and citi reward + amaze  and if possible some advice on which i should go for.currently im not holding any credit cards  monthly spend is around 900 - 1.2k  rarely shopping online  salary giro meet the requirement for uob one saving acc extra interest ratehesitations lies in 1. probably cant get the 20$ cashback from uob evol online shopping 2. if go for uob  saving acc and credit card work just nice,btohqsg
How much do u spend? Is it combine 500 +100 from stash card?,btohqsg
stash account no movements...all at one account..mine not credit card..haha$500 min spend monthly,btohqsg
Oh yeah. There's also premium pass and premium holiday.With premium pass  you can stop paying premium for 1/2/3 years depending on how long your policy is  without being charged any fees.After you used the premium pass(es)  you can go on premium holiday  which they will charge fees from the existing units you have.Which also mean you have lesser premium paid  so naturally your policy value will be lesser.,btohqsg
You don't pay anything online? Outside of buying stuff from Shopee/Lazada/Amazon  you can also make online payment like; book grab/cab  online subscriptions  Singtel bill  hawker with XNAP  restaurants with in-app/website payments.,btohqsg
thanks for the quick reply  appreciate it!personally i dont buy much stuff from shopee ect  online sub are family plans taken care by my friendsi didn't know restaurants with in-app/web payments are counted too  as i thought they are still subject to mcc restrictions?,btohqsg
Welcome to the community.As Melvyn shared  payments via app tend to be coded online  and also contactless in some cases as you make payment via GooglePay or ApplePaySince you know your spend habit and think the programme suits u  just go for it.IMHO even if u can't hit the $600 requirement of the card  seems like u can hit the requirement of the bank account in the least,btohqsg
lots of offline spend can be converted to online spend e.g. fairprice app  buy vouchers on shopback/wogi etc  scan qr using xnap (for hawker food/coffeeshop)  shopback  favepay  foodpanda self pickup. Paying telco bill on telco app/website can be online spend also,btohqsg
MCC is jut a code to determine the type of the merchantThe other categorisation is payment mode - online/contactless/physical/magstripe,btohqsg
Think of it as a combination of the two (even Fave voucher purchases code as online),btohqsg
Maybe check back on your spending for the past months and see if you consistently spend $250 on eligible online spending.Unless you say 100% of your spending is literally tapping your phone or card/paynow/cash.This is based on UOB EVOL card spending requirements. At least minimally you hit $600.The other $250 spending is the ones you currently tap using your phone or card. In fact  if you're already tapping your phone  don't tap your card anymore.,btohqsg
Actually he can also consider UOB One first la...,btohqsg
Haha that's true.. but if don't use Grab/Shopee/shop at Dairy Farm also not worth... But if can consistently hit 1k monthly also not bad,btohqsg
yeah tbh my current habit is just apple pay + paynow everywhere  but i guess if i do go for uob evol i would change my habit when possible  e.g. start using fairprice app etc,btohqsg
what about compare to citi reward + amaze  is there anything i should be careful of for citi?,btohqsg
Oh I tot stash acc come with cc and must spend like uob one card. I thinking to apply stash acc,btohqsg
Don't use for public transport and travel-related expenses (hotels  airliens  etc.),btohqsg
mm yea this one i know  i'd probably add on standard char smart for public transport; and if i don't have much online spending for uob evol  should i just go for citi reward instead?,btohqsg
Why do u need an insurer to invest for u using publicly available diversified funds while charging u hefty fees and commissons  when u can do the same yourself using cheaper platforms like poems or fund supermart.,btohqsg
UOB Evol... i think can use for public transport also. If your goal is to collect miles  can consider looking at Lady's card for UOB One (I use only for Xnap  foodpanda  restaurant payments)Cause now i see your approach abit mixed up on what u wanna achieve hahaha,btohqsg
Should consider if you want miles or cashback :),btohqsg

Hi experts  for Standard Chartered BonusSaver account  paying the bonus saver credit card 3 times with $50  is it considered 3 eligible bill payment?,btohqsg
I think its more of time and effort needed to actually read up on it and understanding the underlying funds and UTs. Plus ILPs are 100% for passive investments where people do not have the time or sufficient background knowledge to do it. I just ended my 10 year APA with AIA and i overall made a good amount from basically just putting my money inside(Definately more from what i would have let it be rotting inside my bank lol) Yea the fees are high but my FA and his team really put the work for it where they texted me every 1-2months giving me market updates and my portfolio suggestions on how to switch funds etc! So if anyone needs a trusted FA  you can pm me.I think yea the stigma towards ILPs are bad cause the people who sell them mostly do it for the commissions. But to me is if u can find a trusted advisor who truly advises you according to your needs and not their wants. It generally addresses its purpose of being a passive income strategy towards wealth accumulation.,btohqsg
i just completed my 10 year APA 2.0 . If you want to know more u can PM me!,btohqsg
Okay I just checked again.. the charges is not by premium  it's policy value.. so the bonus CANNOT cover the charges one üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Meaning the more u earn the more charges right üòÇ,btohqsg
investing thru insurer is typically a bad idea. pick up some investing knowledge instead  learn what is low cost investing  diversification and how different asset classes fit into ur risk profile.,btohqsg
Yea but from what i read  the charges are only for the first 10 years. If you are going to invest it like the 20-30 years you said  when you use brokers they are going to charge you the whole 20-30 years and when you have a bigger pot at that stage technically the brokerage fees you pay will also be higher. Its really up to your investment horizon.,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong  brokers like tiger brokers waive custodian fees if there are regular transactions so won‚Äôt the fees incurred in this case just be the trading fee (which is significantly lower than the 10 year fees that AIA(for eg) charges)?,btohqsg
Brokerage fees are last thing to worry üòÇ more on fund performance   but imo DIY is always better,btohqsg
"Yea but idk if u do the math of 12K premium each year with 8% returns for your investment horizon of 30 years if i do the math  after the 15th year mark  the ""fees"" is already higher when u use robo advisors when compared to the APA.",btohqsg
correct which is why the right FA matters! someone who actually consults you every month or so to discuss about your fund performance and do fund switching because its eventually free to switch funds afterall.,btohqsg
Right FA ‚Ä¶ maybe as hard as finding needle in sea ü´† best is depend on ownself,btohqsg
We are not talking about robo advisors.We are talking about brokers like poems or fund supermart where they only charge a one time fee for purchase of the funds.They don‚Äôt charge the hefty commission that insurance agents charge for the first few years of your ILP.All funds regardless bought from brokers or insurance agents will have ongoing fund management fee from the fund manager.,btohqsg
HAHAHAH very true! But mine helped me alot and i managed to pay off for my ec downpayment with my fiance. And he js also helping alot of my friends from uni too. So yea if anyone needs a recco can pm me!,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs more of you and your friends helping the Insurance Agent to achieve his income goals. Haha,btohqsg
there's no way ilp fee is lower. insurer take a cut  agent take a cut  fund manager take a cut. most ppl jus dunno where the cut was taken from.,btohqsg
Never invest through insurance agents.Always buy term insurance and invest yourself.Insurance Agents should just stick to selling insurance and not investments.,btohqsg
Hi shifus Let‚Äôs say the mcc transaction use physical payment is 5812 (dining)Instarem concerts it to online spend mcc 5812  or online spend diff mcc?Tia!,btohqsg
LOL this sentence demonstrates the lack of financial finesseIf u plan to DCA  switching around just defeats the purpose.If u want to do active investing  why use an insurer platform which is higher cost with restrictive choices.ILP is the WORST product to buy in insurance period.,btohqsg
There is ZERO basis to support using ILP for investment purpose whether being a dca or active type of investor,btohqsg
I think people in the group chat would be able to discern genuine investment testimonials or camouflaged agent referral attempts.,btohqsg
This is true. My advise is don't get ILPs through insurance. As I have shared before. My relative being charged of at least 60% in fees.If he bought the similar etf directly. He probably earn near to 3x of current insurance. And now he just breakeven..... And this is best case scenerio as the funds he bought appreciated quite a lot in value.....Because first have management fee per year. I guess is around 3+%.Then the insurance portion which need a math professor to know. But i guess is around 3% to 6%. Then is bid and ask spread. The buying and selling of the fund is 10%. Which means if u buy and sell in just 1 second. Your portfolio gone 10% in value....So in all your profit is all taken by insurance agent and insurance companies. It definitely help them achieve their financial goal faster. ü§£,btohqsg
No sure u purposely bring up the subject to let your fake Id promote or you really ask. If u really ask then the above is my answer.,btohqsg
HAHA like that also kena  i was genuinely asking. But yea  thanks for all the help guys  really super helpful bunch :),btohqsg
Sorry for being suspicious. But sometime insurance agent will try to promote. üòÇ,btohqsg
LOL ngl it does sound like a good strat now that u mention it... maybe i should charge commissionüòÇ,btohqsg
It's ok if you put in 20 years because fees is up to 10 years only. But if you're like me putting 10 years then is disadvantagous. I planning to free look it.,btohqsg

Hi all  may I know if banks offer special promotional rates for renovation loan if we call in to them for enquiry?Do we need to call each bank to source and compare the best rates?,btohqsg
There are 2 fees u pay when u do ILP through Insurance Agent1. Agent commission = up to 50% for first 2 years and this comes from your investment amount. Eg u pay $10k premium per year  only $5k goes to buying the actual investments. $5k disappears to the agent as commissions. After year 2  the commission is less but still have. Maybe (I am also not sure) it stops after year 10.2. Fund management fee = usually 1-3% depending on the fund chosen and this is an ongoing charge by the fund manager as long as u hold the fund. It is never free no matter u buy from broker directly or through Insurance Agent.,btohqsg
1. For ILP with coverages then yes  it's based on premium and it becomes lesser after each premium paid (so more are allocated to the funds). And after x years they may allocate more after. This depends on what the policy contract says.But for ILP with pure investments  there's a flat % supplementary charge ontotal policy value (including bonuses)for first 10 years (varies between companies but AIA one is disgustingly high.2. Yup  fund management fees are the one is standard across all funds  whether through broker or FA. The lowest is at 0.3-2.5% and highest is at 1.5%-3%.,btohqsg
Renovation loan is one of the most expensive loan you can take. I'll just take personal loan if i were you,btohqsg
Umm.. sorry ask a stupid question.. the incremental fresh funds mean every month need to put in? Or just 1 time would be sufficient.,btohqsg

1. What's your end day balance in all your UOB accounts total on 30 Sep? This balance will be (A).2. Deposit 50k/100k/200k into the desired account and register participation.

Tqtq sir I am new to UOB,btohqsg
This will be easier  because if you got no UOB accounts on 30 Sep  they reference you to $0.,btohqsg
"""everything will be lesser""- you sure? AIA ownself say no",btohqsg
Are you able to hit $500 or $600 minimum spend on eligible uob credit card every month? Also needs to credit salary to uob one account.,btohqsg
Means 20%++ of premium goes into insurance company and agent?,btohqsg
Nothing new. Every month also need to pay supplementary charge. üôä,btohqsg
I meant your own policy value will be lesser ü§£,btohqsg
I wonder if insurance agents explain this part to customers. 20% is quite a lot.,btohqsg
Yes disgustingly high. Other companies also charge but is way lesser ü´† that's why I'm determined to free look. This is applied on top of policy value also  which includes bonuses all.,btohqsg
Yeap would be able to hit. Thanks for the reminder. Tqtq üôèüôè,btohqsg
Remember the amount cannot drop lower than earmarked...,btohqsg
disgusting.. so over 10-15 years... it is ABOUT$14k / $66k = 21% of total premiums paid being sucked out as COMMISSION BY INSURANCE AGENT,btohqsg
This is worse than i thought. My era was 50% of all premiums paid for first 2 years  subsequent years supposed to be like 2-5% only.,btohqsg
I'd rather one take time to understand the financial markets and its structures first. Once you understand the foundations  you'll understandtheprofit motivations of each player in the marketand how each entity (e.g. broker  banks  insurance  hedge funds) earn their dough. Knowing the structure means you know where to reduce your investment costs.I'll give you a starting point: ILPs rely heavily on consumer ignorance.,btohqsg
Yup. Last time is upfront they take from first few years  from that premium itselfonly. Now is take for 10 years  and worse is based onpolicy values.,btohqsg
i really hate it when Insurance Agents:1. try to upsell they are financial experts to be able to help you manage funds well when they are not even experienced in trading themselves.2. give you fake testimonial that so and so make loads of money in ILPs. Even if that is true  i guarantee you that so and so person would have made much more doing it DIY compared to ILP vehicle.,btohqsg
@TC1688it is every single day end amount cannot drop below but not MAB or ADB.,btohqsg

there is some 'withdrawn and redeposited' mentioned in the TNC.so if your 30th Sep balance is say $1000 in UOB ONE account and $3000 in TOTAL UOB RELATIONSHIP  and you are earmarking $100 000i would recommend you ensure:UOB One account > $101 000 at all times until earmark endsTOTAL UOB > $103 000 at all times until earmark endsThis is mainly to satisfy clauses 1.6 (iii) and 1.6 (a),btohqsg

haha the comms not so high n wtv job u do u also get paid 5-6k a month it gets priced into the product,btohqsg
Wonder why Singapore regulatory MAS allowed insurance agents to become financial advisors  in the ancient past  things were simpler when they just sell insurance. All these fees are actually unfair to consumers  particularly those who are less financially savvy.,btohqsg
Anyone can suddenly be a financial advisor‚Ä¶ surely we all have at least 1 friend that is working as one. üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe people like Felicia could chime in on their experiences....,btohqsg
You imagine ur the agent. Will u tell ur client how much they will be charged for the fund annually / monthly? üòÇ not all will. Or most will not.,btohqsg
I don't have and I was looking for one recently because I wanted to buy integrated shield plans. I have finance background but still have to spend some effort to understand the whole insurance thingy. Of course no financial advisor dare to sell any investment products to me although initially they did try.,btohqsg
You have to sift through all the technical jargon and interpretations in tnc,btohqsg
Alot of the time people dont even know what insurance they buy to be honest.,btohqsg
On point 1 I would like to just add onHow can any insurance agent be good in active Investing if he/she is spending so much time on non- trading related activities?Also just to point out that your retail investor which includes these agents have no access to flow information.Even Sophisticated investors who have access to more information that cannot be googled find Mr Market to be challenging  it‚Äôs a joke that agents claim they can be delivering outsized returns with their limited product shelf and limited information access.,btohqsg
Which is why important to review annually or whenever big events in life e.g to make sure ur adequately covered at different life stages imo ü§î,btohqsg
that's the one who quarreled with Seth in youtube comments right?,btohqsg
"You can just tell them upfront""you can forget about selling to me anything other than ISP and level-term insurance""",btohqsg
When insurance agent start to tell u can loan from policy when u cant make payment in future  i know is bullshit liao. What they dont tell u is u pay interest on your own money to insurance when u loan from policy,btohqsg
üò¨ the money comes from somewhere.,btohqsg
Or‚Ä¶ maybe she is the agent? üòÇ,btohqsg
yes this reminds me 3-4 years ago  when interest rates were still rock bottom..MANY INSURANCE AGENTS were pushing clients to borrow at 1% p.a. loan rates to buy '4 to 4.5%' paying Whole Life policies.Now loan rates are probably 4-5% p.a.... i wonder how many got conned and are dying now.,btohqsg
I think the most important is to get a reliable FA. I buy whole life limited pay myself coz i dont think term suit every one need. Buy term invest the rest might suit those financial savy but it dont suit everyone,btohqsg
No idea. I don't read youtube comments  it's a cesspool. Anyway  I was referring to this Feliciahttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/152823,btohqsg
Reliable or not   still must dyodd,btohqsg
If the agents are too open and honest  they won‚Äôt have clients‚Ä¶ ‚Äòwoke‚Äô clients are bad for business.,btohqsg
Haha ya i was one of those FA before,btohqsg
I would like to point out that last sentence is actually not right.In fact it‚Äôs the financially less savvy people who should practice buy term invest the rest in DCA methodology.It‚Äôs a disciplined approach which the irony is that the masses don‚Äôt have that discipline to stick to the course.I would even argue that 95% of the population should do that,btohqsg
In the first place less savvy ppl wont even know dca  how can u do something u dont know right,btohqsg
yeah i sort of agree with this proposition1. savvy then u can do active investment using discount brokers etc..2. if you have NO TIME  or NO KNOWLEDGE how to invest  you can at least do low cost DCA using even simple platforms like Interactive Brokers or POEMS (every month just consistently buy a diversified fund you like). Heck it could even be our local banks.,btohqsg
If u are a ex FA  you realise that alot of people u talk u have very little financial knowledge  even my good friend she dont want to listen cause she dont understand when i explain to her. She just ask what is good then get,btohqsg
haha.. can la.. i have a friend who doesn't care about what card to use.. don't know how to invest..he setup a $x amount regular purchase mechanism with DBS to STI fund every month. The cost is reasonable/low.,btohqsg
In the first place  people in this forum are concerned abt finance which is why they are here  u cant expect everyone to be likeminded,btohqsg
Which is why top 20 is rich and 80 percent remain the average. Even when i share credit card with my friends they dont care for sign up promo etc.,btohqsg
"you have less savvy people joining insurance companies because they are pitched a money dream  and selling costly products to fellow un-savvy people. it's a sad reality but it is what it is.it is only when one learns about the monetary construct then do they realise""I am x years into ABC ILP  should I surrender?""",btohqsg
I never believe in ilp even when i join FA industry before cause of the structure of the ilp. Investment should be seperate with insurance is what i believe in. But it cant be deny for a fact that ilp commission is very lucrative which is why when i review my friend  i told them about their ilp sold by their agent and the downside but did not recommend any replacement product cos i dont want them to think i just want to sell only.,btohqsg
DCA works over 3 basic premises1) committed disciplined investing month on month over a period of 20 years minimum. The longer this period is  the better the results2) monies committed for dca should be left alone to compound over as above (rem the premise is that this monies invested is to stay invested to compound  the time to draw down is ONLY during your retirement years)3) rebalancing of equities vs fixed income % exposure through life stage (this means a basic 2-3 broad based ETFs). Some formula that people use is 100 or 110 minus current age. Example age 30= 70 or 80% equities n 20-30% FIThe problem imo with masses is not about knowledge but discipline in sticking to the plan over the course of,btohqsg
First they need to know there is option of dca  we are privilege to be born in sg whereby there is stable job and ready info  but like i say if u total dont know there is something call dca or interest in finance  u wont do it right,btohqsg
The funniest part is alot agents like to pitch dca concept using ILP and do thematicsThen try to do switching  which totally defeats the purpose of dcaIt‚Äôs ironic max,btohqsg
So the existent of good FA is important as they do educate their client on rsp and insurance importance. Not everyone have interest in finance and read up on it.,btohqsg
I think most ppl outside of finance forums/chat groups probably nvr heard of dca.  And even those who have heard of it (inclthose in financial forums/chatgroups)  a good % of them dun really know what it is. A lot assume average down = dca.,btohqsg
The financial literacy is so low even among those born in 80-90s  there are no youtube or telegram channel like this in those days. Maybe some forum so really is those who are interested will discuss on such thing. Time are different now  more avenue for people to get info. But still alot of friend in my era dont have alot of finance knowledge. My friend just brush it off when i discuss with them,btohqsg
funny how they don't care when it affects them directly..oh well.. their money,btohqsg
Imo a good FA should focus on building up the insurance portfolio and get extensive referrals. Need years to build up. Need to suffer for a couple of years monetarily.Need volume game to make the $ which is hard for 99% of the agent population.How many ISPs or term plan to make the equivalent of comm for 1 ILP or whole life insurance?The comm structure disincentivize the agent to do the right thing. That‚Äôs the cold hard truth.,btohqsg
I am not denying it but i am just saying while u know the way to grow the wealth that does not mean other also do. Failure to plan is planing to fail is not what everyone understand.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt disagree with what u guys are saying about lack of knowledge part.Just that irony is this is exactly what ignorant or can‚Äôt be bothered people should do.Just the initial set up and it‚Äôs good to go for life in a way,btohqsg
"My colleague ""invested"" her CPF OA into a insurance plan for 10 or 20 years.. after cashing out  she told me if she leave in OA  returns is much higher .. dun underestimate the power of compounding with a guaranteed 2.5%",btohqsg
The team lead will probably ask the FA to leave if he/she is focusing only on the low comms products,btohqsg
Yup that that is what happen to me haha,btohqsg
There are team cpf  team dca  team term insurance etc  take the best of each and learn and take baby steps,btohqsg
I have Income critical illness policies bought long ago and recently I found that bonuses are earning 1.5% pa return. Thinking of withdrawing all bonuses paid and ownself invest it  put SA 4% also beats 1.5%. Sum assured will be unaffected. Wise move or not?,btohqsg
Let me just put it out here.Unless u have flow access  don‚Äôt bother with active investing.Even with that  it‚Äôs god damn hard to consistently beat Mr Market.For the minority  it‚Äôs making outsized returns in those few years and staying close to benchmark to beat the long term returns.So for the retail investor  stick to dca in a disciplined manner is your best bet.,btohqsg
I'm team CPF.. but I also realised that CPF is good for those middle income and above.. those living hand to mouth  take home pay already struggling and they need to take loans which push them into higher/longer debt.. and they are the ones who really needs help with financial literacy.,btohqsg
And how do u do that? üòèü´¢,btohqsg
CPF is basically almost free money ü´† tax relief  risk free  employer's contribution ü•¥,btohqsg
Finance situation can be very versatile so it really depend on the current situation of the individual. I give u my example  my first insurance was a endowment for 25 year sold to me by a pru agent  i was only ard 20 then  i was spending my entire income every month and the pitch of force saving and able to take out some after 2 year was suitable for me then. But as i grow and have more it doesnt suit me now coz i have able to save more on my own. Everyone finance situation change with time. Consideration of individual is also different,btohqsg
Only con is withdrawal is at a much older age later down the road üòÇ,btohqsg

Is it common for insurance company to pay 1.5% to customers nowadays? My whole life insurance under prudential also pay about 1.5%-1.6% but luckily my insured amount is not big.Anybody policy bonus given by insurance company is higher than 1.6%?,btohqsg

I‚Äôm going to say something that sounds mean but don‚Äôt jump on it but take some time to think about it.The hard truth why most people cannot be ‚Äúrich‚Äù is because of their outlook on finances.1) A lot prioritize consumption over building up wealth. Delayed gratification is very important.2) Never prioritize investment approachEnd of the day if u r concerned about it  one will find out the solution. Especially in today‚Äôs age of internet.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Read_(philanthropist)#:~:text=Ronald%20James%20Read%20(October%2023 in%20an%20impoverished%20farming%20household.Don‚Äôt need to be so extreme like this guy but I hope one gets the message I‚Äôm sending.,btohqsg

Even with DCA  still have to switch in and out  depending on broader economic situation. For example  if rates are confirmed increasing  I won't want to continue with DCA in a Treasury bond fund like TLT.,btohqsg
DCA is meant to be done on broad based etf for it to be effective eg S&P 500 index or global IG bonds etfU don‚Äôt do thematics for dca,btohqsg

IMO  if you have used your CPF to pay for your mortgage  you are already withdrawing every month. Currently  any excess of BRS  FRS  ERS  you can withdraw. I still leave my SA in my Cpf to get the 4% interest,btohqsg
Exactly! Ppl say CPF stuck till old age  cannot take out everything also. But you paying for your mortgage leh  that one is considered using own money to buy. Without CPF I'm sure many won't be able to afford housing.,btohqsg
Agreed. In fact   our neighbour Malaysia cannot use their ETF to pay mortgage. In addition  a high percentage will have less than 10000 in their EPF when they retro because the government allows them to withdraw during CoVId,btohqsg
Singaporeans need to realise that when you reach 55  a lot of us will have a lump sum in CPF after setting aside minimum BRS,btohqsg
Another question is the incremental fund compare to 30 Sep is from when to when. If submitted in Nov n earmarked by 31 Dec  the balance shall be above 30 Sep balance1). From 01 Dec to 15 Mar 2024Or2). From 01 Oct to 15 Apr 2024.?,btohqsg
Hi folks... For UOB christmas savings  If i SMS registered in Nov  do i need to deposit money by 30 Nov Or 30 Dec?,btohqsg
From 1)Although I‚Äôm always doing the first month earmark and this will be 1st October till my earmark ends. (Not the last earmark period which I am not involved in)I would like to add it always makes sense to participate in the first period so your earmark ends earlier and U can join the next earmark promo again earlier.,btohqsg
@MouseHunter88if based on this table  earmarked by 31 Dec should be 1 Nov 23 to 15 Mar 24.,btohqsg
The idea is the money needs to be in first. Then earmark takes place in the next month.,btohqsg
Hahaha I forwarded forgot to remove the rest of message üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Oooooof now that is tricky üëÄ,btohqsg
Haha. Then to be safe. Just participate in the first period always. No need fear,btohqsg
And that mass influx of withdrawn cash into the economy caused their current exchange rate state.,btohqsg
The biggest fear n problem to this quarter is after we emptied account on 30 September(Sat)  01 October is Sunday. We only can place fresh fund on 02 Oct.Missed by 1 day. üòñ,btohqsg
The ppl have no choice because the government is not helping to survive the crisis. The currency depreciation has nothing to do with the withdrawal but rather primarily due to the low reserve they have plus foreign confidence in the government,btohqsg
Hi experts  Does Xnap link with goggle pay citibank cashback+ card eligible transaction for the cashback?,btohqsg
lol  TnC say must maintain from 1 Oct to end of earmark period  dun make sense at all. Anyway tried and tested will work so long deposit incremental funds by end of month of registration and maintain till end of earmark period,btohqsg
My understanding is for stash  need to have same balance or incremental.  Uob has no requirement. Correct?,btohqsg
yes  but only 1.6%  there are other options that gives 5-10%,btohqsg
Which rewards you are discussing? 5% or Xmas promo?,btohqsg
I read someone mentioned Sgqr with xnap at hawker centre can be used with Google pay.  So far can't find any sgqr that could work with Google pay.  Everytime it said ncode not used yet.  Has anyone successfully used at hawker centre?,btohqsg
Yes this is what I think uob meant. Just poor phrasing.,btohqsg
Oh is it? Can u share what's the options pls?,btohqsg
XNAP is 5814. So any card that accepts mcc 5814,btohqsg
considered online with mcc 5814  lots of card give rebate for either of these criteria,btohqsg
You used XNAP app to scan right?,btohqsg
I see.  Will try again.  Thks,btohqsg
Google Pay App can only scan Paynow QR which is light purple in colour,btohqsg

Question: if I hv uob one saving acc  has earmarked 50k last month  do I still allow to earmark another 50k if I open stash acc? Anyone know the EIR for stash acc include the Xmas promo for 50k 100k and 200k?,btohqsg

Install Xnap app  then go to Google Pay  & input your credit card information. Then use your Xnap app to scan Xnap icon or L icon to pay at hawker or coffeeshop stalls!,btohqsg

There is no extra fee incurred when using Xnap,btohqsg
Icic.. High chance need to chat with cso,btohqsg
Does the day end balance include the interest credited on the last day?,btohqsg
To over simplify  XNAP is the payment service provider while Google Pay (not to be confused with GPay app) is the mobile wallet service.Instead of you providing your details (again) to XNAP  you can use Google Pay  which you may probably have used for other online payments like Shopee or Foodpanda.,btohqsg
Yes but that‚Äôs base interest usually $4. So negligible.,btohqsg

Just tap your SCB Smart Credit Card instead of your POSB Passion Debit Card when boarding bus/train...,btohqsg
cards are automatically enrolled for simplygo so there's no need to activate/deactivate anything if you want to use a different card,btohqsg
Does that mean that if I accidentally withdraw this $4 (since it is not being earmarked)  I become ineligible for the promo even if the incremental amount has been earmarked?,btohqsg

Thematics are subjected to beta risks which defeats the purpose of dca which is to capture the overall market returns.So dca on thematics is a fundamentally futile exercise whereby dca is meant be a passive investing style to capture the market return.Thematics or single security is meant to be active style of investing whereby entry n exit strategies coupled with analysis are involved.So to say doing dca on thematics is a wrong concept fundamentally on what dca is meant to achieve.,btohqsg

there are 2 things  - 1 is the qualifying spend for the uob cash rebates and another is for the uob one account interest. i think the uob one account interest spending are less restrictive.,btohqsg

Passive investors look to replicate a given index or market. Not to be confused with DCA. DCA is not meant to just capture market return  rather it is to avoid market timing  be it for single stocks or single asset classes. This is why online brokers offer DCA on single stocks. So DCA is simply to do away with timing the market. S&P500 is passive investing to achieve market return with beta=1  but DCA is not necessarily passive investing. It can be used for single stocks and asset classes  essentially active investing.,btohqsg
Even different s&p 500 etf have different composition of stock within so ya dca is more of not timing the market,btohqsg

I personally think endowus is better platform because cpf allows only endowus for CPF OA investing  which mean they have went through another scrutiny/due diligence. In terms of performance and fee  I don't think it will be very similar.,btohqsg

uob one card need consistent $500/$1000/$2000 in each of all 3 months in a qualifying quarter to get $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate  one mistake and rebate for whole quarter may be gone  not a easy card to use.,btohqsg

isnt there a low cap for that,btohqsg
how much u spending a month and on what?,btohqsg
Break down your expenses. You'll know if you are more suited to taking the ONE CC or EVOL CC.,btohqsg
total 4k+ on bills transport food shopping,btohqsg
You need to break it down further. Best is to which vendor and if it's online/contactless spending. Cash/paynow spending that cannot be converted to card spending should be omitted as well. The more accurate the better.But just looking at 4k+ spending  the 2k tier for UOB ONE might appeal to you most.,btohqsg
Yup. But you'll have 2k+ more spending that you have to charge to other cards,btohqsg
ohh so UOB one is capped at 2k,btohqsg
i thought the 2k is like a ‚Äòbonus‚Äô outside of the classic cashback,btohqsg
"Not really capped but they only see ""2k spending"". Other bonus cashback from UOB ONE will come from selected spending as well (to min-max  these spending should be within the 2k).And this spending MUST be consistent every month.",btohqsg
If you actually min-max it well  you'll get 8.33% cashback. 2k cashback in a year  which is like paying 11 months for your 12 months spending.,btohqsg
@rpsg999once you breakdown  plug your number into this calculator. Then adjust your supposed spending.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card-cashback-calculator.pageThen for the excess of 2k  you can look into other cards.,btohqsg
lol u guys confusing dollar cost averaging METHODOLOGY with averaging.U need to understand that DCA methodology is based on the basis of capturing market return over long term thru an index etf.So therefore passive investors aspire to do that  hence dca methodology has to be used on broad based underlying on equity index or FI index.By doing averaging on a stock or thematic defeats the very purpose of that.,btohqsg
We have very different definition of thematics.When I say thematics  it refers to any specific asset class or theme investment because it follows a ‚Äútheme‚Äù and not broad based.By doing a TLT  which is 20+ years treasury bond  it is on a specific segment of the fixed income space  that in itself is thematic.,btohqsg
People like to quip dca methodology without even knowing the basis of how this came about and how it is to be applied.It‚Äôs a joke to quote using DCA on single security or ‚Äúthematic‚Äù,btohqsg
Please be aware that DCA is not passive investing.I am aware that Many investors use dollar cost averaging as part of a passive investment strategy  meaning they invest in passively-managed index funds that track an entire market.However DCA with its potential to mitigate timing risk  is most often employed for riskier investments such as stocks and mutual funds.Dollar cost averaging does not spare you the work of choosing an appropriate asset to invest in.,btohqsg
Still nothing for me. My balance still reflected as 02 Dec,btohqsg
lolThat‚Äôs why I say u don‚Äôt understand the difference btw DCA methodology vs averagingThe fundamental basis for dca is utilized by passive investors.As an active investor  who seeks to create alpha  u can use averaging as a strategy but that‚Äôs not dca methodology.Take some time to digest this,btohqsg
Conventional meaning of thematics in the investment world currently are themes like sustainable energy etc. Treasury bonds investment can hardly be seen as any sort of Theme.,btohqsg
DCA is simply not having to time the market. Has nothing to do with passive investing. Also DCA is not averaging that is for sure.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs look at the fundamentalYour quoted example is on 20+ year treasuries  that‚Äôs just 1 segment of the entire Treasury bond universe. Isn‚Äôt that thematic?Furthermore  the financial world uses 10Y as the risk free rate reference benchmark,btohqsg
So if dca is simply to not time the market  what‚Äôs the objective of that? Think about itIf u use dca on a specific security or thematic  and still run the beta riskU r simply defeating the basis of doing dca LMAO,btohqsg
two of you are argue about the definition of thematic. To respond to that  TLT should not be considered as thematic just because it is a subset of US treasuries. Even S&P500 is a subset of entire US or world stock market  but we will not label it as thematic.But if you buy into TLT not for passive investing but you are betting on interest rate to decrease  and you will shift out of TLT if you sense that your thesis is wrong  then you are basically a macro investor that is using ETF to trade.Nothing wrong with that. We are still discussing about definition of various terms.,btohqsg

Let me zoom into this TLT saga he raisedThis is focusing on specifically >20 years maturity Treasury bonds. It‚Äôs a very narrow band of asset class. So it is a thematic play by any definition.Your quoted example about S&P being a subset of the entire  US stock market or world equities but it‚Äôs not considered a thematic is a lousy argument because S&P comprise of 11 sectors and accounts for approx 80% of US cap size. So to try to argue that way is a false equivalence.,btohqsg
S&P500 is 100% US and is 1 out of 200 countries in the world so it is thematic because you are betting that US will do better than average world,btohqsg
Break down your expenses. Then you'll know if it make sense for you to switch to UOB EVOL or stay with UOB One. UOB EVOL is 6.67% effective cashback  when you pay for petrol  you can clock under mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Keen on this.. but worry the USD100k may not be withdraw-able when time comes.. hope Chris or anyone here can enlighten,btohqsg
try trading it  better passive income thn just locking your money there,btohqsg
Again let‚Äôs look below the surface.What are the companies that make up the S&P 500 and what‚Äôs their geographical revenue distribution from?Also measure S&P 500 cap+ volume & liquidity vs MSCI world equities.Try harder,btohqsg
There's no lock in  can even withdraw now but that disqualifies you for the reward,btohqsg
Already gave u the hintsGo find the answer and know your erroneous statements earlierDon‚Äôt expect to be spoonfed for everything,btohqsg
yes  that's why get 4mpd on Amaze+crmc. Why this qn?,btohqsg
I signed up for the cimb savings 3.5% interest back in aug. I recalled it lasts for 6 months with ref month being jul. What will happen after the 6 months? Will i still get the 3 5% with ref jul amount?,btohqsg
depends what promo is available then,btohqsg
hahaha u also same like me dunno the answer üòÜ,btohqsg
"Ok so i assume the 6 months promo will still ""expire"". Is there anywhere i can see when is expires?",btohqsg
Hi  has anyone received the SMS for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme this month?,btohqsg
If I can point out those thingsU really think I don‚Äôt have the answers?Some folks here amuse me. Learn to know when u r not up to mark. üôÉ,btohqsg
yes  this is generally beneficial for lady's/CRMCfor prvi  bare card only if you're fine with paying ~1.25% more in FCY fees for 1 extra mpd,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if gym membership fees can earn 10x points from citi rewards Mastercard?,btohqsg
My bad  I thought OP wants to use Amaze for the foreign spend miles. I misread that OP wants to compared a combo transaction with a direct transaction.‚ÄúHi is it better to use Amaze+Privi miles combo overseas or just use Privi card straight to earn foreign spend miles?‚Äù,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best credit card to get rebates for booking air tickets now?,btohqsg
uob lady 6mpd up to 1k for travel cat  uob lady solitaire up to 3k spending  uob krisflyer 3mpd for sia flight  dbswwmc 4mp up to 2k spend,btohqsg
Hi all  $1k cap limit for 10x rewards for hsbc revolution is for every calendar month right? Not from when u apply the card?,btohqsg
if i am not wrong they work on calendar month.,btohqsg
i might be wrong though  my statement is at the beginning of the month.maybe the rest can confirm,btohqsg
Don't waste your time on this fella. Rare breed indeed. The ego is enormous,btohqsg
Based on Transaction POSTING date within the calendar month,btohqsg
So if I made a transaction on 28 June that got posted on 1 July that eats into the July limit,btohqsg
Wah ok  that‚Äôs really helpful thanks! üôèüèª,btohqsg
hey guys  i just wanted to clarify  for the webull cashmanagement does it work like a savings account? (capital and interest/returns guranteed)?,btohqsg
rather you trade it  better passive income thn just locking your money there,btohqsg
I'm not able to actively trade  I have dabbled in some etfs  but looking for some lower risk options that earn more than my back account currently. if works like savings account i don;t mind cause got big stuff coming up in 5 years  and the markets like that i no confidence when the time comes will it have earned or just flat lined.,btohqsg
Shhh... quiet now.Mutedü¶≠.Reason:stop asking people to dm you for trading in my group,btohqsg
"Accounts like these from what I understand dont guarantee Capital / Returns (basically  like a MMF and other investments that u may make)The only one that ""guarantees"" if u wanna be safe is banks since SDIC-insured 75K.Correct me if im wrong",btohqsg
yea  thats why asking here  'm okay with not guratneed returns  but capital guranteed is important for me at this time,btohqsg
pretty much the same  but im talking about singapore banks ma üòÇ,btohqsg
understand haha ;;;  yea. i was just finding out cause their page doesn't EXPLICITLY say capital guaranteed. so trying to find out,btohqsg
I think u can look into SSB too if that' an option,btohqsg
Anyway minor add-on  insured amount will eb raised tor 100k from APr 2024https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mas-increase-coverage-deposit-insurance-scheme-100000-april-2024-3790666,btohqsg
I have some in SSB current interest rate not enticing tho.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  everyone is trying to find the holy grail of investments:1. Very low risk2. High Returns3. Quite liquidUnfortunately  I think you have to choose 2 of the 3 :/,btohqsg
haha yea i hear yout. oh well its really fine. Worse come to worse i just put in bank for like 3.2%,btohqsg
Have you considered UOB one account? I think many people in this group keep saying its an effective interest rate of 5% if you have 100k (if you have the salary credit + $500 CC spend),btohqsg
Hi all  i have both uob one account and uob one card. I managed to spend 500$ on eligible spending for the past 3 months. Where do i see the $50 cashback from uob one card?,btohqsg
your quarter month is defined in your statement. Not everyone has the same quarter month i believe. it will reflect in the following month past your quarter. if not received means you did not meet the requirement.,btohqsg
I ahve  the issue is my spend  I'm currently running other CC and not really keen on jumping stright to UOB  for my spend (plus i dont spend enough to spread it across 2 cc ),btohqsg
to add on  my rebate posted in 12th of the following month past my quarter.,btohqsg
if you have insurance that accept card payment then no need jump CC. just make sure is >$500,btohqsg
Is paying SP services using uob one CC better than posb everyday CC?  Does anyone know?,btohqsg
HAHA i just checked  my insurance still below 500 i might need to relook see if can move things aroudn to still make it worth it. but yea thanks for reminding me!,btohqsg
if have then just charge to the debit card comes with UOB one account. (UOB one debit or Mighty FX debit),btohqsg
I try to use uob kris debit card on axs  it didn't get thru'. Privi Miles card got thru' & curious to find reason. Share it if any one knows  tQ,btohqsg
Uob one card had a fraudulent transaction & got cut off to restart my insur >$500/mth. so the vendor or house always wins,btohqsg
thanks for the tips!Just wondering if the transactions need to be via master/visa  or will nets spend also considered?,btohqsg
