Idk that is cant be arsed or what,btohqsg
maybe they lazy stip cause they know what they'll find in there,btohqsg
or else i kun liao byebye,btohqsg
Actually there is a reason u feel this way and it ALSO have to do with our laws,btohqsg
our laws sometimes i find damn stupid,btohqsg
Set by people that dont know jack shit,btohqsg
our exhaust sound max 70dB i think,btohqsg
1. Old cars are seriously unfavored with coe and parf rules2. The population of the old cars always declines quickly compared to my3. Therefore the market for mx5  ae101  rx8  dc5 etc all VERY small.4. So workshops and stockists will NOT carry such parts5. They focus on fast moving and latest models6. U get the impression nobody want to service u  which is partially accurate for shops that want to do current models and fast biz.,btohqsg
but the F L P M all can above 70,btohqsg
Doesnt help that our labour costs high also,btohqsg
Nobody wants to spend too much time on something that wont make much money,btohqsg
That's why i kept emphasizing why malaysian workshops willing to entertain.,btohqsg
They quote u 3x the price we also think is cheap,btohqsg
labour cost high sudden people start changing own oils and brakepands inside multistory carpark,btohqsg
Alot of ppl start alr actually,btohqsg
U nv see now mobile service center very popular,btohqsg
They come ur carpark chanhe oil,btohqsg
Rent van cheaper than 1 workshop,btohqsg
but they dont have the oil i want,btohqsg
This one really problem i realised,btohqsg
U go buy the oil alone  alr as ex as the service itself,btohqsg
Then end up also lan lan go back workshop,btohqsg
Then u service at workshop with labour include also 200+ nia rigbt,btohqsg
LL suck thumb drive to ws,btohqsg
Today we have very serious talk.,btohqsg
Hey guys i got a few cartons of High grade fully synthetic Petronas 0W30 engine oil.5L bottle selling at $60. If keen just drop me a DM.,btohqsg
Also some clarification into why u angry hahahaha,btohqsg
But honestly  u see our cars. Who want out business in sg,btohqsg
Can hardly do anything  and parts also no market,btohqsg
And like u said also the currency difference,btohqsg
But in the end  we restricted by what we have,btohqsg
h22 prelude Clutch also no stocl,btohqsg
I bought what i think is the last rx8 engine mount on this island last month,btohqsg
