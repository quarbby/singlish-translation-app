Back earlier this year  there is a beetle on fire as well.,btohqsg
I stopped using Shell after I found rust inside my fuel tank  that was many years ago. Have been using Caltex on one car and Esso on the other. Both Conti  and both using 92. Never considered others besides BP. In Malaysia Petronas is still the best choice for me.... Support my customer so they can pay me😜😜😜,btohqsg
Regular b&b car here  I getBetter mileage with essoBetter smoothness with caltexBetter generally better power and mileage with shellSpc and sinopec I will never pump. Feels thin and the consumption feels high.,btohqsg
Safra discount also 22%. One week. Too bad i foreigner,btohqsg
Old but still gold sir. As with many things in life. 👍🏼,btohqsg
Key takeaways for me would be: good to keep an in car fire extinguisher (not just for yourself but may also save another car)  use approved components  don’t mess with electricals unless one really has to  be religious on maintenance and don’t sit on visible fluid leakages 😁,btohqsg
One of your helpers went to help you retrieve something from your car? 😉😉,btohqsg
Which is a smart move sir. Otherwise one can only take 97-98 100% of the time.,btohqsg
Not sure about Singapore but fairly common in the US to have off pumps. this excludes any introduced from fuel additives.,btohqsg
Maybe the acceleration stuck like mine 😂,btohqsg
