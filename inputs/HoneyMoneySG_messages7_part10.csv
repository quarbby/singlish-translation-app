that's the case of Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
Noob question. Bought S27 using poem  anyone know how to sell?,btohqsg
Likely SSB rates will remain 'high' this yr... hovering ard the cpf OA rate....#imo,btohqsg
Hello  just curious which cards do you guys use for dining transactions?,btohqsg
I use OCBC 365 as it has cash back 6%,btohqsg
Citi cashback card  and amaze card 6.5% for dining,btohqsg
Is ur qn in relation to anything? üòÖ,btohqsg
Haha I used to do miles card vs cashback comparison. Miles outperforms. But after covid happens  not sure if it is still the same. See if anyone still looking at miles,btohqsg
I am actually. Just started plus I switched from cashback to miles recently,btohqsg
Folks  any content idea for cpf topics? Long time never talked about it,btohqsg
You Pretty much covered it all already.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the cards y‚Äôall use!,btohqsg
Hi! I'm curious to know if anyone used Hugo app before? How's your experience like?,btohqsg
Ok I just searched for 'Hugo' & saw some chatter above  thanks!,btohqsg
maybe can do one on how the recent messaging from govt seems to move away from the idea that CPF is a bank account from 55,btohqsg
don't take MAS regulation as blanket assurance for anything at all,btohqsg
Just read tru  saw that it is regulated as major payment institution by MAS.,btohqsg
must check specifically what they are being approved for,btohqsg
But if you dine in hotels be careful as the code will be under hotel code so i only use it for independent restaurants only.  I use MCO card (Chronos card 5% cashback) for dining eg at the Grand Hyatt  and other hotels.,btohqsg
good morning everyone. may i check  i realize my DBS World women cc n HSBC Revolution could not earn 10x point when make payment via Cardup n Ipaymy. is there any other method to earn the 10x reward when making rent payment?,btohqsg
please guide me along and Thank you all sifusüôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
both WWMC and HSBC Revo don't earn 10x on CardUp or ipaymy - it's been the case for some time now.in order words  specialized spending cards like WWMC and HSBC Revo won't earn 10x bonus w CardUp/ipaymyyour next best is general spending cards that generally earn 1.1 to 1.6 MPD (or 1.5% cashback)alternatively  you can consider Citi PayAll to earn 2.5MPD on Citi Premiermiles or Prestige at a 2% fee,btohqsg
üò¢yes. even amaze card will cease to earn by 1stJune2022 onwards,btohqsg
In this case which miles is best now?,btohqsg
the approach to miles should be earn to burn  not earn to keep/stakeso depending on which locations you wanna go  you can decide which miles programme you prefer- most Singaporeans like SQ so Krisflyer is preferred + Star Alliance (all miles credit card can earn Krisflyer miles)- there are other miles programme w/ other airlines worth looking into (Citibank has the most number of exchange partners)on which Miles Credit Cardthere's usually a two-pronged approach when it comes to miles card:(1) Specialized Spending cards- cards which give an upsized bonus on specific categories (10x points or 4miles per dollar (4MPD)- they usually don't have min. spending but a spending cap per month:- DBS WWMC (S$2K/month via online only)- UOB PPV (S$1K/month via mobile app paywave)- UOB VS (S$2K/month via mobile app paywave  min S$1K)- Citi Rewards MC/Visa (S$1K/month via online  exclude travel)- HSBC Revo (S$1K/month via Paywave + Online)(2) General Spending Card- all other spending fall into here (charity  education  healthcare  etc.)- or if you exceed your specialized spending  you can also use these- all major banks have their own general spending card- AMEX has Krisflyer Blue/Ascend- Citi has Premiermiles  Prestige- OCBC has 90¬∞N  Voyage- DBS has Altitudeand morebut everyone has different needs  different spending patterns  etc.(1) examine your own spending habits and see if a specialised spending card can cover most of them(2) see if it's worth getting a general spending card from the same bank so your miles pool togetheredit: I learnt all the above from the Milelion and the Milelion community over the years üôèüèª,btohqsg
yea..basically i spend a chunk of it 750 per month just for rent but seems like this amount will only earn me in the General Spending card now.,btohqsg
ima use either renthero for DBS Altitude or Citi Premier payall as both i check can get like 1.2,btohqsg
Hi  is this only for DBS? Or even citi REwards card?,btohqsg
this for DBS. i think Citi Reward still allow Amaze transaction üòÉ,btohqsg
Citi PayAll is now 2.5 MPD till 31 July 2022,btohqsg
Thanks! I thought so too.. amaze should change their prefix AMAZE* so that DBS cant track.. hahaNot sure if thats the way it works.,btohqsg
it's just a cat and mouse gamemust accept that change is the name of the game,btohqsg
take note that even for Amaze  the underlying MCC still needs to be valid for 10X bonus,btohqsg
"may i check  i have citi premiermiles card  and when i wan to apply for citi reward cc  and it states ""promotion applicable for New card holder""  means im not eligible?",btohqsg
Not anymore..New card holder means that dont have any citi card for the past 12 months as a principal cardholder.,btohqsg
not eligiblemost banks when they say NTB  they literally mean no previous credit card relationship in the last 12 months,btohqsg
Only AMEX runs promotions that are New to Card,btohqsg
"Have you done a ""Should we keep our money in CPF or are there better alternatives?""As someone who's self-employed  I personally would rather keep my money to myself  but there are those people who believe in contributing to CPF cos of the benefits.I never had the time to do extensive research on this topic.",btohqsg
might be a bad comparison but CPF is like having tuition - it‚Äôs getting someone to guide you along  or personal finance on training wheels.I think most people (including myself) often overestimate our own ability ot manage finances - so maybe CPF isn‚Äôt that bad (other than the withdrawal age that changes as life expectancy increases)‚Äî-alternatively  see it as diversification.- people who see it this way often see CPF funds as fungible as cash- so CPFOA/SA function as a bond component in overal investment portfolio (4% SA MA),btohqsg
may be can talk about whether to top up cash in SA or transfer from OA to SA,btohqsg
"Thank you for your input... How is it ""as fungible as cash""?",btohqsg
ah my bad - for certain spending - like housing  children education and healthcare,btohqsg
I think it all depends on the context  individual money personality  investor profile  etc.but if it‚Äôs done purely to lower taxes (i.e. you are just a small amount shy from lowering the tier/bracket)  maybe it‚Äôs worth considering.but if it‚Äôs purely to grow money then it goes back to how you see CPF or what kind of role in plays in your investment portfolio.‚Äîmy personal realisation is that as a young adult - my priority is to increase my income as much as possible so that:- I reach BHS asap- then my MA contributions goes into my SA- only do topup to SA when it makes sense to cut tax- I invest my OA elsewhere through other mechanisms,btohqsg
not sure if u have talked about this before  but OA to SA transfer to fill up SA asap vs leaving some room in SA for RSTU tax relief may be useful?,btohqsg
can cover for young adult and also those that nearing retirement ..,btohqsg
Hi  can I clarify on this.If Amaze is paired with CRM  I would imagine all transactions made would appear as online spend  and that would have earned the 10x rewards?,btohqsg
yes provided the underlying MCC (merchant category code) is eligible for 10x bonustravel spending  even if online  doesn't earn 10x,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask If Amazed paired CRM  if the transaction below eligible for 10x?1. Top up on Grab pay2. Pay for grab transport or grab mart3. Pay on dining or grocery?,btohqsg
(1) no(2) yes(3) yesCitibank awards upon posting so it's pretty quick to check too,btohqsg
Thanks 1. Transact on 27th2. Transact on 28thBoth still in pending status from I see from Citi sg appsYet to receive my Amaze physical card.,btohqsg
