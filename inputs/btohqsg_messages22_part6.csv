It is lesser work for them overall  because they don't have to go through another round of reassessment unless the income of the buyers drop.E.g. Just before key collection they ask you to submit income docs:1) If current income docs > flat application income docs  do nothing.2) If current income docs < flat application income docs  reduce loan quantum.,btohqsg
I have no objection about anything much to wanna send petition  ha haWhat i find annoying is  the ambiguity from HDB,btohqsg
ya agreed... they should streamline their responses.,btohqsg
I think this change or no change in income part is or should be the same for both HLE and HFENeed BTO HFE people to confirm how it is like when nearing their key collectionAny idea when the first batch will be available? 🤭Probably not much difference for the SBF HFE peeps,btohqsg
still long. HFE started in May 2023. But applicants needed valid HFE letters applied for a flat in the October 2023 BTO sales exercise. So it should be Oct 2023 BTO onwards.,btohqsg
Yes i think so just submit the docs that needed,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone have any speculation on when the Feb results will be out?,btohqsg
Anyone's profile picture missing already for feb 2024?,btohqsg
Iirc April but no specific date,btohqsg
Curious to know this as well,btohqsg
my grant is 25k and max loan is 250k. Is it normal?,btohqsg
Grant 25K  meaning household income is 6.5 - 7KNot sure about the loan part,btohqsg
ThanksAlthough i still think the change isn't that significant or drastic kind 😝,btohqsg
By the way  anyone knows if HFE preliminary is still a thing...?I mean  there were people who saw higher grant or loan amount during the prelim check until they received the final letter of sort,btohqsg
"Yes  just one applicationBut in terms of the grant  loan eligible etc  doesn't say will be more stringent or whatEsp for the loan part since grant still be more or less ""like that""",btohqsg
yea but the loan they offer me for maximum is only 250k,btohqsg
Usually when Feb bto results when out ?,btohqsg
Usually hdb say April u just take it as last day of the month.Just put your hopes as last day of the month,btohqsg
Only 250K...So  how much are you expecting??,btohqsg
Then what is this 160K loan here about?Is the 500K BTO something that you can afford comfortably or are you looking to finance the bulk of it through loan??,btohqsg
the 160/170k is the mid range loan from hdb and the 250k is the max loan from hdb,btohqsg
Have you selected your 500K BTO?,btohqsg
i am just asking if its normal for grant to be 25k and the loan amount to be 250k maximum / 170k mid as well,btohqsg
Calculate your MSR at 30%  with int rate 3.16%  chk the loan tenure against your approval. If the amt aligns with your max loan amt  it's considered normal. If there's a discrepancy  you may need to consult with HDB to understand how they derived the max loan amt.,btohqsg
Grant Is GrantLoan Is Loan2 different things ya,btohqsg
What do you mean whether it is normal for grant or loan amount to be those figures...These are based on assessment of your income + other applicant details and so onIf your salary is higher  chances are your loan amount eligible will also be higher but grant becomes lower,btohqsg
Grant amt usually incl Core Occupier income whereas loan base on Owner income,btohqsg
My Grant is 25K based on my applicationMy loan based on my application is $200KBut that time is my wife is not PR yet. (I apply with my wife and SC child)When my wife become PR and i included her in as co owner so hdb included her Salary contribution and loan amount increase to $400KSo this is it.Grant is Fixed when your application that time w your applicant's Salary contribution etc,btohqsg
But Grant is included all your Applicant's and yourself Salary to count the grant,btohqsg
Suggest you rethink your 500K BTO?Because it doesn't sound like something you are truly comfortable withAnd don't forget things like renovation and so onGetting your own place is supposed to be a happy thingThe last things you will want next time are to be burdened by the loan and to quarrel with your wife over money,btohqsg
For HFE  once you register and apply for BTO  cannot be reassessed for higher grant? example  loss of income,btohqsg
in short  if got pay increment over the years  better not tell the officers ?,btohqsg
You will still need to provide this before collection of keys.,btohqsg
Grant is less flexibleBased on 12 months income but like start from 14 months before the applicationLoan  i believe still can try to appeal when nearer key collection but (sigh  bluntly) don't pin hopes,btohqsg
Say  application is in February 2024Period of income to be assessed should be January - December 2023,btohqsg
And applicant should ensure continuous employment or income during those 12 monthsAt least during the HLE era  there were people who didn't work a few months and not eligible for EHG,btohqsg
Hi  where did you find this?,btohqsg
Thats why its best to secure bto/sbf asap. Before hdb change rule again. Bloody sian,btohqsg
Will it work for DIA? that if both applicants are students 12+2 months prior to HFE application  they can be eligible for Deferred Income Assessment?,btohqsg
High chance can go to SBF,btohqsg
What will be  will beMaybe rules change for the better next time leh,btohqsg
I doubt. Better for gov n hdb only,btohqsg
Imo global economy uncertainty could affect housing. Be cautious with spending. Pte homes often twice as costly as HDB for same size. Cycle: Sell HDB after MOP  upgrade to private. Risk: Housing bubble if income doesn't keep up. Financial trouble may force sales  not covering CPF refund.  Stay safe!,btohqsg
i enquired regarding my hle application and the reassessment nearing key collection / expressed concern abt current low loan quantum - and i was told that theyll reassess again and revise the loan if theres an improvement in income.hope this helps if anyone is concerned haha,btohqsg
That’s the old one. HFE no reassess,btohqsg
For those signed lease before oct 2023 like me still will using the HLE during key collection  not HFE.,btohqsg
Around when will your reassessment be?,btohqsg
Will the improvement in income have to be substantial  not like increment of only few K over the years to make a difference?,btohqsg
personally  mine is still abt 3-4 years away.,btohqsg
yeah thats fine  they said they’ll do a general reassessment again to help with loan quantum.,btohqsg
