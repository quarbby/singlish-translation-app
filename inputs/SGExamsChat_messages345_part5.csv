For me like 3-4 days ?,btohqsg
i havent but in my experience w khan acad at least they tend to teach more US centric syllabus so it might miss out some stuff and add in extra stuff which might no be necessary,btohqsg
Hm. Interesting. I'll give Khan a shot,btohqsg
yea i wld say theyre not bad at explaining concepts (just a matter of whether its relevant for our syllabus or not),btohqsg
I'm asking 'cuz I wanna take Maths mods in uni without JC experience  and I don't wanna did :p,btohqsg
Local unis have math bridging modules,btohqsg
You'll likely need to take those before being allowed to take most math mods in uni,btohqsg
NTU isn't telling me what they are. They literally just told me take it without H2 and see whether I can handle it,btohqsg
Is that how NTU handles it,btohqsg
What math mods are you looking at anyway,btohqsg
Literally all the 1k mods. Foundation of maths  then maybe cal 1-3. Honestly I'm not sure. There's nopure logic course  Inthink.,btohqsg
Finally done with Project work written report T_T,btohqsg
Ready to submit tomorrow morning  kiddo?,btohqsg
My school (millennia institute) wants it all submitted by tomorrow,btohqsg
yo sch ends on 13 oct for 4na right,btohqsg

Homie...bless ur soul. Glad to know it was a good run for u,btohqsg

"""It's 5am and I can't sleep""",btohqsg

Are study groups a thing here ?,btohqsg
Hii um did anyone get a call from moe? (for o-lvl students),btohqsg

"""plz ask ur parentz to login to this address: ..."" ðŸ˜‡",btohqsg
Literally just take my edusave account,btohqsg
hii  can someone tell me how we should manage our time for chem paper 2,btohqsg
like how much time we should spend on section A ideally,btohqsg
For pure? I think my Cher recco abt 1hr for sect a 40 mins for sect b,btohqsg
i will try to stick to that tdy,btohqsg
But generally if I spend >2 mins on a qn,btohqsg
Like staring and not thinking of anyth,btohqsg
i would say try to spend more time into the first question of sect B because itâ€™s usually always an unseen data-based question which has links to whatever weâ€™ve learnt  for me it requires more time to process the info provided (almost always a page long),btohqsg
