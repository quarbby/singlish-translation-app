As a frequent complainer myself  its very easy to complain about things at face value without understanding the behind the scenes needed,btohqsg
The old library had more study spaces but now they removed it idk why they place some art sculpture there now very zo dengThe library honestly dosent need to be open at 8am cause no one really goes that early and at least close at 6 or 630Uhuh i disagree not everything i need to know are in the notes and there are some unnecessary stuff there tooFor the night study im not really complaining about the timing i think its fair enough but its more of jurong reigonal library is just 1 mrt stop away and i wld have more benefits there,btohqsg
actually more study spaces is created ever since gd news cafe is gone,btohqsg
The area at the back isit,btohqsg
No one knows abt the area there HAHAHA i only go to the back there cause got meeting room i use for competitons,btohqsg
Ik ah but its more of what sets MI apart so that it cannot be half as good as other jcs?,btohqsg
Also can i ask if the ecg counsellor is good,btohqsg
I heard he go tell teachers abt the students stuff,btohqsg
Okay fine art scultupers  i agree. Stupid.Library dont need to open at 8am just because there are no students - uh librarians dont need to clean up/put back things where they belong/set up the library/turn on aircon etcetc?Notes - agree to disagree. I know of people who can do well just with MI notes. So is it your understanding bad  or teacher bad  or notes bad?,btohqsg
I talked to him once hes nice but abit urhhh long winded ah,btohqsg
i mean when it needs to be open or closed isn’t really the point bc it’s based on standard working hours,btohqsg
You really think MI wants to be half as good as other JCs? We admit people who cant even go to JC lmao,btohqsg
Also the library literally no one borrows the books,btohqsg
so i feel its for display purposes only,btohqsg
if they can remove the shelves,btohqsg
Then it wouldnt be called a library anymore would it,btohqsg
But mi alw complain no money,btohqsg
Im just saying the library could be opened later cause no one really uses the library in the morning and im sure the librarian wld wanna get more sleep in the mornign HAHAI know for a fact its the MI notes and maybe its me or the teachers cause something that isnt supposed to be there isnt supposed to be there,btohqsg
Might as well call it aircon study space,btohqsg
Yea no one does i wanna know how old the test papers there are,btohqsg
And the money is dedicated to hiring higher quality teachers,btohqsg
I think holy grail ruin business for them alr HAHA,btohqsg
The mr loo talk to us,btohqsg
oh cannot use aircon this term,btohqsg
Back in my days in MI we just spam aircon in classroom fr,btohqsg
Honestly they shld just cancel the world trip thing IMO its a waste of money you cant add that into your college app. Its a thing MI does to attract students. Other school can do this cause they git extra money haiz we dh,btohqsg
Wah lucky eh my class aircon dun even work,btohqsg
ehh if they can wake up one hour later  end same time and have the same pay then yea ofc but if they have to end later like 6+ to make up for it then i feel most working adults wouldn’t take it,btohqsg
Between how long ago i graduated and now  the aircon probably already spoiled,btohqsg
Yea and the environment prolly changed also,btohqsg
Anyway i didnt mean to have a debate with you about MI  its not like i liked MI a lot when i was a student there HAHAH,btohqsg
Its just that maybe there are things to be grateful about  if you look at it differently,btohqsg
you can debate with me about ntu,btohqsg
best thing about spms is the ac,btohqsg
Trying to be positive but rn there isnt much except that i have a good bio teacher,btohqsg
So world class some professors ive only seen twice in a semester  mid terms and finals,btohqsg
i have friends that were the group leaders for that lol,btohqsg
Okay fair tbh MI really has gone to shit after my batch's teachers all left,btohqsg
My chem and math teachers were quite good,btohqsg
My classmate used to be taught by her,btohqsg
Gg now the best math cher is mr kee,btohqsg
Honestly if i had her growing up in MI my math grades probably would be very different,btohqsg
where they said this kind of info shld be in ur head by now,btohqsg
My math teacher just assumes all A math knowledge is assumed,btohqsg
And i didnt take A math before,btohqsg
Thats how i feel about chem econs math and gp,btohqsg
And honestly the bridging classes in MI are dog shit,btohqsg
it’s ok SPMS will hone your skills,btohqsg
I nvr go cause i took a math,btohqsg
2 years in and im still scared of integrals,btohqsg
