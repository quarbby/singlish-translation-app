But multiplier account even with salary plus spend can only get 1.8%,btohqsg
Hi Oscar  I have another question LOL,btohqsg
For Yuu  when we use the card on foodpanda for example  if you food is worth $12  and then delivery is another $4  does $16 go towards the $600 count? Or is it only $12?,btohqsg
Thank you!! to whoever can answer this haha,btohqsg
May I check for UOB one account and UOB Stash account. Assuming uob one has reached 100k already  can I withdraw a portion of the salary to park under Stash acct every mth so that it is higher than previous month? /,btohqsg
Yes  leave 100k in UOB One  and transfer the amount that exceeds to your stash. thats fine,btohqsg
But i dont see why u would use stash. If ur stash is below 70k  it gives 0 to 2%.If u put excess in ocbc  with salary criteria alone  its 2% for anything $ below 75k. If u manage the balance and get the save criteria also  u can get 3.2%,btohqsg
"For me.. stash only makes sense to me for ""stashing"" exactly $100k to earn 3.05% with no need to do anything  hassle free.",btohqsg
Investment in usd etf - poems or interactive brokers? Which is more competitive?,btohqsg
Cos I have always been under ocbc 365 for many yrs but they hv so many criteria.1. I credit a salary of at least S$1 800 via GIRO/PayNow via GIRO2. I have increased my average daily balance by at least S$500 monthly3. I spend at least S$500 on my OCBC 365  OCBC INFINITY  OCBC NXT  OCBC 90°N or OCBC Rewards Card4. I have purchased an eligible insurance product5. I have purchased an eligible investment product6. I have maintained at least S$200 000 account balanceI only can maintain 3 out of 6 all these yrs  even for some people with max 200k there already also no use.While UOB stash  the rules seems simpler. Just step up every mth. You maintain 100k there  u meet 5%pa,btohqsg
200k is a trap  bonus interest only on 100k,btohqsg
Ok! So when the foodpanda arrived  only $12 was credited instantly,btohqsg
what u mean by $12 credited instantly?,btohqsg
UOB Stash effective interest rate is only 3% overall btw  not 5%,btohqsg
You left out the * part for first 1500 customers each week,btohqsg
3%* for UOB Stash account.200k in OCBC 360 gives you only 4% p.a. No one puts 200k in OCBC 360.,btohqsg
Hi allJust wana check how UOB signature visa calculated the UNI$ rewards?I spent locally $5900N I was rewarded 3600 uni$Pls highlight 🙏🏻🍀,btohqsg
9x bonus points capped for $2k local paywave/petrol monthly. 9x2000÷5=3600 uni$,btohqsg
Thanks 🙏🏻So the rest $3900 I spent awarded nothing 😅😅,btohqsg
Best to check t&c before spend 👍🏻,btohqsg
should have gotten up front 1 uni$ per $5 block per transaction for eligible spend under the $5900.,btohqsg
Is it for certain merchants onli?,btohqsg
Does foodpanda delivery charges count towards $600 min spend?,btohqsg
Hi is anyone here familiar with moomoo welcome rewards and how it works? Is this possible?starting with zero asset balance on 30th march31st march deposit 100k1st april claim 1 APPL share (frozen)2nd april withdraw 100k  balance is zero1st june deposit 100kafter 90 days  on 1st sep  APPL share will be unfrozen2nd sep withdraw 100k and redeem APPL share,btohqsg
Anyone applies for tiger boss debit card? Reviews or thoughts?,btohqsg
i applied for fun but dun intend to use it as credit cards provide a much btr reward rate,btohqsg
all merchants so long not excluded,btohqsg
You are right  effective rate 3%,btohqsg
Has anyone tried whether can combine cdc voucher and capitavoucher to buy something?,btohqsg
Look like you did not read the credit card TnC before using it. Perhaps you want to read it first? There are many other clauses you may want to know too.,btohqsg
Seems like you didn’t read the T&C carefully enough 😂Surely deposit 100k and taking it out 3 days later to get one free AAPL share must be too good to be true,btohqsg
You will need to spend 900 this month to hit the requirement,btohqsg
You need to maintain the amount for a period of days. Where got so good let you put in 1 day take out next day give you free share,btohqsg
I have read the tnc  many times. But my special case which I mention  is that i will take the frozen share first. Withdraw 100k  then... at later date put in 100k to fulfil the 90days criteria  but after 2months of getting the frozen share,btohqsg

I beg to differ on the ocbc calculations from@MelvynEzi.For ocbc 200k (assuming salary  increment  and 200k criteria met  effectively is only 3.2%  becos the 4%+2.4% only applies to first 100k  u average out  its only 3.2% on the whole 200k.i.e.not worth putting 200k in ocbc360,btohqsg
You need to maintain assets for 90days from 1st April,btohqsg
Hi moomoo users  may I ask if anyone has managed to deposit cash from bank to moomoo on a Sunday? Is it immediate?I am thinking if i deposit via DDA from DBS to moomoo on 31st 9am  will it reach on 31st march?(Asking becos i intend to subscibe by before 1st april 0000hrs),btohqsg
Transfer in is immediate if using correct method. But Subscribe takes 2-4 days.,btohqsg
Besides UOB one Which is 2nd best to put in 100k?Std chart is revolving every 2 months. Ocbc as above does not seem attractive,btohqsg
Correct method means?I previously did a DDA transfer using the moomoo app  link to my DBS acct. I did it on Saturday  it was immediate. But i didnt try a sunday😱,btohqsg
For shoppee installment plans  which credit card to use?,btohqsg
Means your transfer is immediate. To subscribe the cash fund  it will take another 2-4 days.,btohqsg
Yes  subscribe to confirmation to PL computation take around 2 days. But I have asked moomoo cso  as long as i click the subscribe button before 1st april 10pm  i am considered for the welcome reward.Thank you for the share!,btohqsg
hi guys  i signed up for the webull moneybull yesterday.i understand that the idle funds will be transferred into the moneybull SGD or USD funds every morning at 0730 and 0930.based on what I am reading  i would assume it is automatically transferred as long as i dont retain or deactivate.when the funds get transferred into the moneybull  does it take any processing time? because i am not really seeing any updates in my moneybull  it still shows $0 in both USD and SGD,btohqsg
Hihi  do you also keep a separate 100k in UOB one acct? Can we simultaneously earn 5% in uob1 and 3% in stash?,btohqsg
"Yes u can. Its called the ""duo"" in uob on website's marketing.But i still suggest put uob one 100k and ocbc360 100k instead.(Stash is only 3%  ocbc360 is 4% with salary+save criteria)",btohqsg
Hi gurus  can I check with you for yuu merchants  do we get 9x base points for every dollar spent or 10x base points with the dbs yuu card? I am abit confused  seeing that the website says 10x points for every dollar spent but it seems to be reflecting 9x on my yuu app. Also  the bonus yuu points given is reflective of the statement month or calendar month? Thanks so much!!,btohqsg
Same as my suggestion above. 100k uob one  then ocbc360 100k,btohqsg
Check again after 12pm or 1pm.,btohqsg
