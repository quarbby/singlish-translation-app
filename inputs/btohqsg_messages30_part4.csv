If you cancel all other applications will be voided,btohqsg
how you know sbf high chance of within supply? application rate is low? which was the bto you got 60 out of supply?,btohqsg
hello all! i applied for the bukit batok BTO and our queue number is out of supply by 22. hence i understand there might be the slightest chance we can get to select a unit. however under what circumstance would we be banned for a year?hope to clarify this as we don't want to lose our chance to apply in July 🥹,btohqsg
If you get called up and reject the chance to book  that will cancel all your subsequent appointments and incur the penalties for a year. Even if your July queue is better  if you get called up first for the previous one  you have to go for that one,btohqsg
so let's say i get an appt date  but it's in July  and i choose not to go for it  even if i ballot in July it will be voided right?,btohqsg
i remember seeing somewhere that if there is less than 10 units available we won't be penalised? do you know how true this is?,btohqsg
Yes correct  they will cancel any pending applications if you cancel or reject anything.As for your 2nd question  the answer is yes. If 10 units or less (5 or less for SBF)  can ask HDB for a wavier  or if racial quota runs out then it's automatically cancelled by HDB without any penalties,btohqsg
thank you so much!!! 🥹🙏🏼 really informative 🤝🏼,btohqsg
oh sorry one more question  if we choose not to select a unit  the ban will run until next year October 2025? so 2026 launches we can apply right?,btohqsg
If I'm not mistaken the penalty period starts from the point of cancellation/ rejection  so it may depend which launches you can take part in again. If you're a first timer couple/ family  you should still be able to apply for BTOs as a second-timer  although the chances aren't very good. If you're a single or are already a 2nd timer  then you'll be barred from balloting for a year,btohqsg
2nd timer alloc is only 5%  it will be increased to 10% in the future.. but even 10% vs 90% alloc is 9 times. almost impossible to get unit as 2nd timer especially in popular areas,btohqsg
Dammit - someone rent me a wife so I can go for these flats.,btohqsg
Need anything call go to showroom see,btohqsg

Hi may I know if first timer is 1.5 what is that mean? Sorry I first timer for SBF.,btohqsg
1.5 families fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  typically for sbf  1st timer allocation is at least 95%  while 2nd timer is up to 5% of units available.,btohqsg
assume there are 15 families applying to 10 available flats. so 5 will not get it,btohqsg
So for this case it's basically 1.5x application rate for first timers for at least 95% of available flats,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if they changed the month to release bto again? I remember it was Feb  June  Oct last time. Seems like now the next project will only be release on July,btohqsg
Or am I just remembering it wrongly hahaha,btohqsg
Ya they changed it to July for this time round,btohqsg

Don’t know haha depends on HDB whims 😂,btohqsg
How do u guys find the upcoming July project location!,btohqsg
Hi all hopeful homeowners We posts useful information not covered by HDB on the upcoming BTOs on our Instagram. We have analysed Tanjong Rhu ParcFront  Chencharu Green & Vines as well as Stirling horizon so far  with more to come.Hope the information provided can help you guys!https://www.instagram.com/btoselect/,btohqsg
Oh no I mean  like how do u guys think about the locations hahaha,btohqsg
Here is an article by StackedHomes:https://stackedhomes.com/editorial/we-review-the-july-2025-bto-launch-sites-bukit-merah-bukit-panjang-clementi-sembawang-tampines-toa-payoh-woodlands/,btohqsg
Guys  is this a standard instruction in HFE or I have to pay levy for bto? Currently I have a resalt flat but I didnt get grant. I used to own a flat with grant with my ex husband but i didnt benefit from the resale profit because i withdraw my name out from the house before he sold it.. i only got my cpf back.,btohqsg
This will be considered your 2nd purchase if you take grant  hence levy is incurred. One person $20K. If 2 pax is $40K for 4 rm,btohqsg
Anybody know is the Result of Feb 2025 BTO out ? If yes the only way to find out is using our Singpass and dont wait for HDB letter ..all through our HDB Singpass and save paper ?,btohqsg
Housing & Development Board---(Receive your Ballot Results) 2024 BTO: There are updates to your flat application. To view details  visit HDB Flat Portal > Login via Singpass > My Flat Dashboard > I am a new flat buyer > Step 4 Receive Your Ballot Results.---This is an automated message sent by the Singapore Government.,btohqsg
Hi  did anyone receive hdb email about some updates for bto (feb exercise)? Thought results were out but seem like nothing new,btohqsg
last time they already told u results will be out in April  now is still March  what do u expect?,btohqsg
I expect not to receive any email if there are no updates?,btohqsg
So just checking if im missing out anything here with you guys,btohqsg
it is probably the update on the no. of ballot chance or if u are under any scheme,btohqsg
yeah usually it's abt the no of ballot chances etc. nothing new.,btohqsg
First email notification is to confirm your application has been received. Next month den will inform your ballot results.,btohqsg
If it doesn't say it's the result  it's not the result,btohqsg
I think the logic quite straightforward,btohqsg
Yes i know it is not the result  im just asking if there is any extra step to take,btohqsg
i don't get any email leh,btohqsg
But is just said April result out,btohqsg
i apply SBF btw.. not sure whether there is difference,btohqsg
