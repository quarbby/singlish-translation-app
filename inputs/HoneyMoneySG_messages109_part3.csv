what‚Äôs a good way to easily hit that min spend on credit cards?,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits and lifestyle,btohqsg
Oh? What kind of vouchers? and where can we buy?,btohqsg
Are there apps or e-wallets where we can ‚Äútop up‚Äù with CC  then spend the money later?,btohqsg
U can but the mcc wont qualify for any reward except grab top up with uob absolute cashback,btohqsg
Chris has a yt video on this topic. You may refer to it.,btohqsg
I bought lots of NTUC vouchers when UOB Lady's gave 6mpd,btohqsg
you know when u use the vouchers you don't earn link points ya,btohqsg
Buy eCapitavoucher from Wogi  then spend balance in any amount. In app purchase is excluded as it is counted as wallet top up.,btohqsg
Actually can just buy wogi credit and redeem which ever voucher u like later more flexibility,btohqsg
Is there a mcc code for wogi purchase,btohqsg
Does anyone know if webull is involved in some forex trading thing ?The profit seem extremely high,btohqsg
Hi all. What's the best choice if you're a lazy person and wanna park your cash somewhere without the restrictions of crediting salary etc  but at the same time you have access to your cash and use it like a regular bank.Is Maribank only a digital bank for interest or it has Debit card options too?,btohqsg
Ya maribank  no debit card option,btohqsg
The other chat also got another entertainer üòÇ,btohqsg
Heard they are same person with 2 accounts.,btohqsg
GXS or maribank would be your best option. GXS has a card that you can use but the troublesome thing is higher interest is only given on the savings pocket and transaction made with the card will need to be deducted from the main account. So if you want to spend it  you need to transfer from the savings pocket to main account. But GXS stopped new joiners le,btohqsg
Haha maybe kena ban there create another account,btohqsg
Ah in that case my only option is Maribank 2.88% or UOB One with the salary credit and spending yea?,btohqsg
Also from Wogi website? Can't find where to buy Wogi credits,btohqsg
What do you mean plan? Just the ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Ok ok I'll check it out. Thanks,btohqsg
Any reason HSBC EGA is not considered?,btohqsg
Not sure what‚Äôs his definition of restrictions. GXS and maribank is the ones that I know that is more no frills and he mentioned that he‚Äôs lazy and want to park his funds somewhere,btohqsg
Just went to read on hsbc egaIs the 1% rebate on giro bill payments also applicable for iras tax?,btohqsg
SeriouslySo if you pay $5k tax per month then they will rebate $50?,btohqsg

Anyone tried using amaze + CRMC for petrol at msia recently? (Pay at pump directly  tap) Mine doesn‚Äôt work. Network issue?My YouTrip can go thru tho..,btohqsg
Some petrol stations  especially in Japan  won‚Äôt accept amaze.I think it‚Äôs when the transaction is an open amount (u haven‚Äôt pump the amount yet) amaze cannot fully support.,btohqsg
Nope  didn‚Äôt. But for restaurant in msia  payments still able to pay tho..,btohqsg
Maybe can try going to the counter to pay,btohqsg
Assuming you have already setup your monthly GIRO arrangement (as required by CardUp)  they will just deduct through GIRO on next GIRO deduction date.,btohqsg
Hi! Sorry if this is a weird question! I‚Äôm thinking to apply for the HSBC Revolution card. Would it be too late to be the first 500 eligible applicants for the gifts if I apply asap? I‚Äôm new to signing up for a credit card  so just wondering if I still stand a chance to get the PS5.üòÜ,btohqsg
No one will know for sure. See your luck only loh  but the offer has been out almost a week. Imo  if I need the card and ok with the rest of the gifts after the 500 applicants  I would still apply. Otherwise wait for the next time,btohqsg
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt looking out to apply for a card until 2 days ago then noticed the deal. Welp. Alrighty then! Thanks for your input!,btohqsg
No worries. It‚Äôs still quite a decent card to have. Can just wait since you‚Äôre not planning to apply without the deal,btohqsg
Can drop a email to cardup they reply fast. But as far as i know  if u already set up giro  they will deduct from ur bank on 6th or 20th. So u can check. And for card up recurring payment  they told me they need IRAS to deduct once for the NOA23/24 before cardup can do their payment. I was told May and June payment is an estimate base on previous NOA. So the 1st payment for NOA23/24 is in JUL. Therefore U need put a due date for cardup in JUN  so they can deduct the money from ur creditcard in JUN  couple weeks to reconcile with IRAS  so that it will be in time for JUL deduction.Jun- 1 deduction from ur giro/1 deduction from ur CC for payment in JUL.Jul - 1 deduction from CC for Aug payment..etc etc.Best to ask cardup still. cheers,btohqsg
Hope citi bank will have good miles promotion soon to compete against ocbc 6 miles and also uob ladies card,btohqsg
