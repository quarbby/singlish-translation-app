I think the place I worked at served alc  they just make those >18 serve,btohqsg
min requirement is o lvl cert,btohqsg
since we dont have o lvl cert yet,btohqsg
technically we will get an o level cert,btohqsg
the min to get a cert is a pass for one subject,btohqsg

i know np has track record of shady camps but no worries things are too in control now for anyth like that to happen again HAHAHAH,btohqsg
and red camp is day camp,btohqsg
Do we need friends when we go there,btohqsg
What are some signs of a glow up,btohqsg
"u go tiktok and u receive comments like ""wah glow up sia u""",btohqsg
If externally I can help tell you 😂😂😂,btohqsg
But like externally can meeting like beauty standards?idk,btohqsg
Ohh hhahahI am kinda scared to post content just on social media k general,btohqsg
you become more confident of yourself,btohqsg
"hmm but seriously speaking I'd say like  u look at an old photo of urself and go ""wow wtf was on w me"" to ""i look decent/better now""",btohqsg
Idk but for me I follow the k beauty standard more,btohqsg
I would do that but that sounds a bit narcissistic,btohqsg
no lah dont say to ppl,btohqsg
I am just curious because I had a recent weight loss of 8-10kg 💀And idk how to describe the change,btohqsg
ok but thats a lot tho did u work out or smth,btohqsg
I thought it's normal?? To loose about that much weight??,btohqsg
as a person who doesnt work out  im not sure but that number is scary,btohqsg
Now time to gain it back in muscle mass,btohqsg
4-5 months??I started running in JulyThen started running everyday in September?,btohqsg
I think push ups and other body weight exercise are good for now,btohqsg
but if u dont do ur work then dont u deserve it,btohqsg
Big project at JC year 1,btohqsg
like if u dont study for ur exams u probably wont do well isnt it the same thing for pw also,btohqsg
how are the pw groups formed?,btohqsg
is it moe assign or what,btohqsg
some ppl have the option to choose good ppl,btohqsg
at the very least they shd make the grouping standardised,btohqsg
like idk ppl at moe roll dice and choose,btohqsg
idk cuz for my sch internal projects practically everyth is u choose,btohqsg
(cause us to be cliquey af but imo it's not a bad thing),btohqsg
same but that 1 doesnt affect like national exams what,btohqsg
I don't rly give a shit alrd,btohqsg
i feel like moe shd js anyhow grp the ppl,btohqsg
even the teacher will have some bias,btohqsg
THATS THE WORD I WAS LOOKING FOR,btohqsg
sister brain washed by geog alrd 💀💀💀,btohqsg
nah cuz i dont study tourism GI so its been a long time since i saw it,btohqsg
I understand having personal issues but must,btohqsg
It doesn't excuse u from responsibility,btohqsg
mine grouped based on our sec4 grades / O level l1r5 💀,btohqsg
If u cant deal with it,btohqsg
U will hv to suffer in uni/workplace,btohqsg
It's okay to be angry but,btohqsg
Coz it doesnt matter if u the hard carry or slacker  ur prof/boss only cares if its done,btohqsg
can alw make new friends HAHAHAHHA thats the purpose of the camp tbh!,btohqsg
but if u scared then u shld bring friends with u,btohqsg
and turned out the best groupmate in my group was the person with the highest l1r5,btohqsg
my senior told me during her time   her grp members alw say they too busy and stuff studying for other subj so they dont help her  end up she did alm everyt the whole yr then like 4 weeks before the oral thingy her grp mates scolded her for not telling them what she was doing like damn dumb la if u refuse to help then u want her to tell u for what,btohqsg
externally idk but internally i think i just see character development and myself being happier than ik its a glow up,btohqsg
for pw is it u can choose what to research?,btohqsg
Idg why ppl look at ur r5 for grping,btohqsg
I wonder why he would like to flex such things.,btohqsg
ya i wld be so embaressed,btohqsg
They are people who seek validation,btohqsg
He should flex the grades to a poly officer.,btohqsg
Let's say it's betw close friends,btohqsg
If the friend grp have culture of like,btohqsg
eh is it true that OCS only take in top GPA and 90RP people,btohqsg
Yea man. The officer I know didn’t do so well for As but he still get to become one. Maybe cuz he ‘s from HCI.,btohqsg
i mean on average  if u slack  ull get worse results even for pw,btohqsg
but teammates make such a huge difference,btohqsg
u throw 1 slacker into hardworking team,btohqsg
But they gotta put in a lot of effort,btohqsg
my team was 2 carries and 1 normal,btohqsg
and i feel like we didnt even do that much,btohqsg
its 30 pages over a year,btohqsg
Also depends on the kind of groupwork,btohqsg
its not just dependent on grpmates,btohqsg
ur teacher affects a lot also,btohqsg
my seniors helped me more than my groupmates LOL,btohqsg
They just want to maintain good perf in SG I guess.,btohqsg
thank god 1 of my senior offered to zoom me for 2h up to my wr submission,btohqsg
in uni wouldnt u need to do basically 1 pw every term?,btohqsg
That depends on your major though,btohqsg
Not every major relies on project for grading,btohqsg
mine he always half assed. We texted him then he never replied then he only replied 1 week later to scold us why we made no progress. But we couldnt progress because he never replied our questions earlier...,btohqsg
i saw some rj kids put that as a listing on carousell lmao,btohqsg
they even took photo of their pw cert then cover the name,btohqsg
later not even their own cert lol,btohqsg
some of the chers in my school made the class do personality test,btohqsg
then they group according to that,btohqsg
not mbti  i forgot what already,btohqsg
lol still cant forget those chers that group all the slackers together LOL,btohqsg
ask everyone for 5 people they dowan be in the group with then group top 5 together into 1 group,btohqsg
is it better in mi though because they do pw in year 2   by then pretty much everyone knows how everyone is like already,btohqsg
LOLLLL then how was your experience,btohqsg
y2 according to 2021 resource and update LOL,btohqsg
MBTI is just a for-fun party trick kind of thing,btohqsg
why got so many sia... what yall even do LOL,btohqsg
some guys in my sec school straight up paid me to carry them for group projects LOL,btohqsg
+ got time to do meh?,btohqsg
either that or they pay for all the shit we need to buy for group projects,btohqsg
since when got so many grp projects in sec sch 💀💀,btohqsg
i had like 2 projects per sub every year so auto every year minimum 6 already,btohqsg
i thought you were from dhs wait or i mess up with someone else,btohqsg
i only got do one grp project in sec 1,btohqsg
quite stonk sia 20-25% of my grade,btohqsg
i mean if the team is good then yey,btohqsg
then we always aim for minimum 80% for projects one,btohqsg
but if the team is shitty,btohqsg
mine the slackers paid me money to carry,btohqsg
they straight up said they gon slack then i just ask for money lor,btohqsg
in sec 1  i rmb my teammates create the slides damn ugly,btohqsg
depends on the project lor   the highest i ever gotten was $30,btohqsg
i had to edit all of them,btohqsg
Better than NPCC chairperson do up proposal with a panda background,btohqsg
i think still ok depending on how long u take also,btohqsg
bedok can study 1 day b4 exam,btohqsg
💀💀 ok hopefully jc dont have weird shit on the slides again,btohqsg
they put random food images as background** and then use,btohqsg
and squeeze all the words into one slide,btohqsg
i see until my eyes pain,btohqsg
if i still had a copy of the slides,btohqsg
i would have taken a pic,btohqsg
but my gmail acc deleted liao LMAO,btohqsg
U laugh but i seen similar shit in uni,btohqsg
Lucky I'm not in a major that requires presentation all the time sia,btohqsg
dont need to add the entire wikipedia paragraph onto 1 slide bah...,btohqsg
Some people just copy word for word,btohqsg
no they use the fancy fancy weird ass font,btohqsg
Eh dont be the useless fck that cant present ok?,btohqsg
Everytime i see bad slides i die abit internally,btohqsg
idk if i can present stuff 💀💀,btohqsg
At least now things are better. People know how to use things like Slidesgo,btohqsg
I rather do my slides frm scratch,btohqsg
You know some of the girls in my course use the flowery templates for all slides.,btohqsg
It doesnt rly look v professional,btohqsg
Even if the flowery ones looks out of place,btohqsg
then must try to add photos,btohqsg
Yeah man. Example. We did a slide on Nike and the template is some flowers?!,btohqsg
