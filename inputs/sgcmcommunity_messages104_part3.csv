I heard got a lot of M3 this morning ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ even some manual ones,btohqsg
Heard got people also pushing a car around.,btohqsg
Malaysia Vpower racing is ron98 while Singapore vpower nitro is ron99,btohqsg
Baseline Ron 95 to push ron97/100 by adding petrol additives,btohqsg
Tbh just play safe and pump Petron ron100. Can't go wrong,btohqsg
Some cars have the ability to increase timing with better fuel & vice versa with poorer fuel quality.That aside. High Octane rating also reduces the amount of knock during high load like lugging.,btohqsg
There should be grease on your wheel bearing.You can go to tyre shop and ask for help,btohqsg
Oh...tyre shop can also pump grease into wheel bearing?,btohqsg
Tot it's a sealed type bearing?,btohqsg
How did you guys celebrate christmas,btohqsg
Wonder if they realised they've priced themselves pretty much out of the competition...in the early stages of the price hike they were about 10-20cts above the rest for 95 98 and vp,btohqsg
I watched like 3 episodes so far- J,btohqsg
Now their 95 is at competitive level liaoü§≠,btohqsg
"V power is marketing excersise. The fact that it is nothing more than just 98 with addictives which in my experience makes cars reduce timing vs normal shell 98. The higher price makes you think the normal fuels are ""cheap"" in retrospect.",btohqsg
If its so much more expensive to produce. Why can they do that V-power for price of shell 98 promo.,btohqsg
The shell station has 0nly 95 and v racing.  So no choice. Best avoid it.,btohqsg
All their shell have all 3,btohqsg
Just that some pump is 95 and v racing,btohqsg
yup pumped 97 few days ago at that shell,btohqsg

Hi all like to ask if gear box problem and don't change how long will the car last? Will the car suddenly stop and die on the road?,btohqsg
Answer to first question  the car is a time bomb. The 2nd  it's a matter of when  not if.,btohqsg
Erm  not that surprising though  a lot of car owners are pretty ignorant on cars,btohqsg
I mean I knew people were ignorant  but usually they hear the clunking and keep driving..not know the issue and ask how far...,btohqsg
The mechanic said to change the gear box cost about 2k but the car only left a year to be scrapped‚Ä¶any advise?,btohqsg
find another workshop and ask to get those scrapped gearboxes,btohqsg
