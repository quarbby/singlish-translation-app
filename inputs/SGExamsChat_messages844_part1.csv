Bro u digged a message from July,btohqsg
sgexams isn't even a community mostly meant for anything outside school & academics-wise,btohqsg
"hi guys  does anyone know or have interacted with redditu/pyroSevenbecause why is bro justifying & encouraging this unhealthily toxic  hidden trend of ""elitism"" in singapore?",btohqsg
his most recent comments combined on r/sgexams has nearly a total of -200 downvotes lol,btohqsg
he's still active from this morning when i posted a random comment,btohqsg
like for one user's community post comments  alone,btohqsg
but honestly reddit's algorithm method of calculating post scores & comment karma  isn't reliable at all,btohqsg
i could use this ( past info )  as a reference to how active i am on the internet when it's not really an updated information i would personally consider sharing nowadays,btohqsg
the amount of ridiculous content being shared on sgexams baffles me,btohqsg
i get spiking high blood pressure,btohqsg
from the comments section  as well,btohqsg
LOL that's his only positive up-voted comment,btohqsg
This one more than 200 downvotes already,btohqsg
i wanted to say -100 at first  but one comment already had -97,btohqsg
the post hasn't reached 24 hrs sial..,btohqsg
wtf was his most recent comment did i see  in this post,btohqsg
he talks as if he has no ounce of a single respect for anyone aside from people of authority  higher education / skills ( aka more recognized qualifications ) & career that's more commonly known??,btohqsg
even then  he's probably gonna be the type to be complaining more negative stuff with the people he encounters in healthcare  retail or customer service lines of work,btohqsg
ya i hate this kind of comments,btohqsg
usually i just avoid looking at reddit for the sake of my sanity,btohqsg
adds literally no value to the discussion,btohqsg
the only active communities on reddit i tend to follow with  or comment more often are more full of people with basic politeness & respectr/cDramar/noveltranslationsr/novelupdatestwo of the subreddits i mentioned are generally inactive / dead  and then the other more active one is mainly more regulated with the community moderation-wise,btohqsg
wtf are people upvoting comments like these forthe one specially by r/pyroSeven,btohqsg
LOL is r/SMRTRabak a shit post reddit,btohqsg
just don't get caught can alr,btohqsg
i also usually only use youtube,btohqsg
i don't even use spotify ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
mostly its posts concerning the mrt system,btohqsg
even then  that clickbait title & nail photo was fucking random,btohqsg
lol these people would rather complain and post online  compared to bothering to do something irl,btohqsg
is like another ver of r/singaporehappenings,btohqsg
i hate spotify with their ui/ux changes,btohqsg
but i never really got used to it,btohqsg
when i want to listen to a song it plays another,btohqsg
i still prefer this older versions,btohqsg
i hate sg reddit communities in general,btohqsg
in general foreign communities also got a lot of propaganda going on,btohqsg
i might as well entertain myself with r/HonkaiStarRail or r/MobileLegendsBangBang,btohqsg
but i would prefer foreign communities compared to sg,btohqsg
i mean the r/singapore reddit is foreign made,btohqsg
majority of the moderators are not singaporeans,btohqsg
no lah  just generally speaking because i don't really condone or support the idea of showing literally zero etiquette online with singaporeans who are usually interacting with online people  aka strangers,btohqsg
i consider r/singaporeraw more local than that,btohqsg
there's a bunch of brainwashing propaganda that misleads everyone,btohqsg
just because of the r/singapore subreddit title of the community itself,btohqsg
Also here is something you may not know about r/Singapore,btohqsg
i think i know about the weird feature of social app,btohqsg
r/ russia created by ukraine r/ china created by usa ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
don't really understand it too deeply myself or the idea of such,btohqsg
but i'll just shrug it off and go about my own life,btohqsg
