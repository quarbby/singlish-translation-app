we dont even look down on you  we are literally providing you with the resources and you choose to shut bedok out just because you thought he was rude,btohqsg
Its not a one time thing,btohqsg
Ouhh how can you not know this,btohqsg
sarcasm is prevalent  but it does not mean rudeness.,btohqsg
People message me abt it too,btohqsg
But in this chat it’s more casual,btohqsg
but yes tldr use online resources,btohqsg
It’s a good skill for uni anyway,btohqsg
you will run into situations where just using the materials given by your profs may not be enough,btohqsg
so you find online stuff to supplement,btohqsg
Also for coding: learn to use stack exchange,btohqsg
My friend told me data structures and algorithms are very hard,btohqsg
Its the place with codes right,btohqsg
It’s a forum where people ask questions about their code,btohqsg
Most questions you can think of asking,btohqsg
Likely a similar one has been asked before,btohqsg
I think it may be the theory of it but yea it’s a fundamental part,btohqsg
Could read up on it too,btohqsg
knowing math well helps in certain areas too  esp data science and AI,btohqsg
The only reason why Reddit is still existent.,btohqsg
Three branches of math I’d focus on are statistics  calculus and linear algebra,btohqsg
So I will learn python and other languages and see from there,btohqsg
Python is like the most used language and is quite beginner friendly imo,btohqsg
You can do almost anything with it just that it’s not specialised in something,btohqsg
Should I buy mods from carrousell,btohqsg
ok html is easy as a markup language but most people don’t see it as coding,btohqsg
nah don’t waste your money rn,btohqsg
online is more than enough for the time being,btohqsg
is this for specific courses? or just all courses in general,btohqsg
coming from comp sci  can speak for it  definitely some errors that lecturers may never have hit because you were doing something to improve your codes that they may not have done  but not sure abt the rest of the fields,btohqsg
I’m interested in doing psych which i think at the same time is prob heavily researched and essay based?,btohqsg
okie thanks! maybe I’ll just see what happens when i enter uni,btohqsg
Hii!! does anyone know anything about how Loyang view secondary/Springfield secondary/ tampines secondary/ changkat secondary. Asking for a friend. :),btohqsg
it's a general statement. uni profs give lectures and materials to learn from  but to get a full understanding  you usually have to spend time combing through stuff like textbooks  online sites  etc on your own. slides/notes given don't go in depth enough,btohqsg
for psych  it's likely a combination of theory notes + a ton of readings for illustration,btohqsg
but it's still good to know how to look up more should you need it,btohqsg
more technical stuff for psych would be quite a bit of statistics too,btohqsg
u have 2020 and 2021 and those years from older syllabus?,btohqsg
uhhh i only have 2020 and some older years,btohqsg
ahh if dont mind can send?,btohqsg
pocoyo said fuck the ikea manual and create her own hole using a screwdriver,btohqsg
gl to u if I somehow engineer ur aircraft,btohqsg
I’ll be sure to avoid that plane,btohqsg
I got there with help from u,btohqsg
gonna duct tape the wings because you can’t figure it out,btohqsg
That is arguably just as bad,btohqsg
dude my dad was a party freak,btohqsg
the best is yet to come,btohqsg
I have watched 3 animes worked out studied code,btohqsg
How do I get myself to do wor,btohqsg
