but the interest there is kinda bad so im thinking if there are other 1 year FDs or smth,btohqsg
I can’t use the card in their physical store right,btohqsg
UOB One? Can always self deposit from the 19k.,btohqsg
Their store has a Kris+ QR code can I use that?,btohqsg
should be but double check with store,btohqsg
If u r fine with choc finance that’s one option.Otherwise maribank mm fundsOr cimb if the offer is still there - no daily interest tho and not that much more,btohqsg
chocolate finance not fd right? it's a fund management platform right? wish means the 19k might not have good return if it doesnt do well?,btohqsg
Ya I'd go with traditional banks first if possible. Ocbc 360 or UOB one is pretty decent.,btohqsg
It's a company which guarantees returns for the first $50k. Of course  guarantee is by company here  it's not a bank so no sdic.,btohqsg
Sure or not. I opened my account 31st Jan and sms in for the Feb & March promo plus 5X transactions. Called in this morning and the CS confirmed I am enrolled.,btohqsg
Hi all  is it possible for Citi smrt points redeemed to be cashed out ? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can give advise on private banking. What are the interest rate across banks (generally 2.5%?) if I have AUM of 2 million sgd?I tried to check online/chatgpt but the info is just not there  or I have to reached out to the bank to get the info? Thanks,btohqsg
Better check w the bank. From my understanding  saving acct w good interest isnt the main offer for private banking.,btohqsg
Private banking usually need more then 2m aum i think. 2 m should be 1 tier above priority banking,btohqsg
UOB privilege promo  - 2.8% for 3 months. Flexibility of depositing & withdrawal during these 3 months. Just make sure you don't fall below the $350k,btohqsg
Anyone got the invite to deposit USD into their choco account already?,btohqsg
Time to sign up choc finance and for the card,btohqsg
Anyone know if it matters to use physical amaze card or amaze on apple pay when we link with CRMC? Will using amaze on apple pay still allow us to receivr 4mpd?,btohqsg
With amaze will have rewards  without amaze will not have rewards. But depends on MCC for rewards.,btohqsg
Hi everyoneif i planned to use UOB Preferred Platinum for my big tickets purchase and use installment 1k per month. will i get the 4mpd for every month i pay installment ?,btohqsg
ah okay then for installment should i use amaze+crmc ?will it work?,btohqsg
ah okay. is there a solution for us to have our big ticket purchases on installment and still earn miles for every monthly payment?,btohqsg
See if vendor offers atome payment?,btohqsg
GXS Boost currently at 2.98% for 3 months. 2.38% daily  0.6% at the end of period.,btohqsg
Able to renew every 3 months?,btohqsg
If you aim to renew  I'd rather put them in this month SSB.,btohqsg
Can chose auto renew. If not  withdraw to main account. Rates subject to change  used to be 3.28%  3.18%. If withdraw before 3 months  u still get 2.38%.,btohqsg
hmmm how does ssb work? you lock in the current rate for the next 10 years? what happens after 10 years?,btohqsg
They return you the capital plus the last interest. You can get new set of SSB.,btohqsg
Sing investment and finance got saving account at 2.6% without having to do salary crediting.Why no one here mentioning,btohqsg
maybe i suagu  actually never heard of this,btohqsg
I guess its not as popular/less advertised than others. And 2.6% is not fantastic fornon banksaving acct.,btohqsg
It's a bank savings account. Just that withdrawal can only be done over the counter  no ATM/card.,btohqsg
Unless above 4%  not many will bother with such inconvenient accounts.,btohqsg
so little   banks all giving higher interest,btohqsg
Looking into putting funds into SSB - did anyone notice that the rates for next month (March) is actually higher than this month?,btohqsg
But those bank giving higher interest requires several actions from u  like salary crediting  need to spend on their credit cards  need to purchase their insurance or investment products before they can increase the interest rates,btohqsg
some dun need any of these,btohqsg
depends on which bank   but mostly is just spending on credit cards / salary crediting which salary crediting can be worked around easily for some banks. And most people will likely spend above the minimum requirement of spending per month,btohqsg
Where do you see the rate for next month ssb?,btohqsg
Sorry for the confusion. But I assumed SSB March rates meant the application window is in March? Next month?,btohqsg
SSB issued in application for Feb -> Mar SSBUsually go by the code name,btohqsg
"But to answer the question  yes it fluctuates and nothing suprising given the ""higher for longer interest rate narrative""",btohqsg
Ohhh no wonder. My bad! Thanks for clearing it up. Just checked the DBS app and you are right.,btohqsg
For the crmc minimum spend  can we buy supermarket vouchers?,btohqsg
as in min spend for sign up bonus? should be eligible,btohqsg
Yes assuming online. For physical please pair with amaze. for those who are new can watch thishttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I?si=r4hXSRHSmO-4AxJe,btohqsg
Yea I've paired with amaze. Didn't want to stress out about spending on it as I'm already trying to hit 500 on uob,btohqsg
hm as in amaze+ uob? uob excludes amaze,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC. UOB is separate :),btohqsg
