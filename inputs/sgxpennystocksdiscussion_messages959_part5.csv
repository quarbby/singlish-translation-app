Global indices Sea of red  Oilies down almost 5%. Not sure how this will affect our pennies.(Past observations  have shown our pennies tend to do better when US indices are red - usually open weak then recover)But  I think no rush  stay vigilant and watch first better. Will see morning matching and should be removing some of the existing buy orders first likely and watch how our market react first.But Oilies like RR high chance gap down from the get go looking at Brent Breakdown and the indirect correlation effect.Note to self and all:The difference between surviving the markets is to exercise and discipline when it comes to stop loss.,btohqsg
