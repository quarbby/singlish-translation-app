SOME People will exploit this. buy cheap then faster sell for profit. And repeat WOOOHOOOOO!!!!,btohqsg
This and abundance of PHVs and car sharing,btohqsg
like currently what they have. but the 2nd coe onwards ur min bid 100k lo. aiya  its all tweaks and suggestions at the end of the day.,btohqsg
The ones with 1 house and 3-5 cars also rich what.,btohqsg
Absd on a car  mate are you seeing where you're going with this?,btohqsg
COE so crazy people buy car  still rich.,btohqsg
im referring to ABSD on house.,btohqsg
Half of the cars on the road are for PHVs  at least in my area LOL,btohqsg
Pls donâ€™t ban FULLLOANSQUAD!!!! Then we will go out of business and we will see less GTR and Out of Reach CARS AROUND!!!,btohqsg
A car in Singapore is already inaccessible.,btohqsg
Where it suddenly becomes possible is the gig economy and stupid financing schemes that puts people in bad debt.,btohqsg
It'll just make life harder for the bottom end of the buyers,btohqsg
Then pushing more of them to use grab  car sharing  etc.,btohqsg
And that just brings COE up again,btohqsg
Think also the ones who NEED a car. A disabled family member  or elderly  or dogsâ€¦okay the last one cannot lah but needs.,btohqsg
Until everything is car sharing  leasing and PHV,btohqsg
Imagine having 6 meetings across the island and have to take MRT everywhere..,btohqsg
The COE is already a barrier  but if thereâ€™s a need  youâ€™d only make those who need it suffer.,btohqsg
I clap for whoever can do this. But cannot be like Bugis <> City Hall hor.,btohqsg
It's all about what you can afford and what you think is necessary,btohqsg
6 meetings in a day? On the MRT  tight man...,btohqsg
WHO HAS SO MANY MEETINGS IN A DAY!,btohqsg
9am 11 am 1pm 3pm 5pm 7pm?,btohqsg
If you're in business meetings 6 times a day,btohqsg
No one wants to meet with me ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
Probably can afford a car if you make sound financial decisions,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have lunch budget from company.,btohqsg
Which by the wayâ€¦ ROCKS for convenient food!,btohqsg
My boss not in this group chat sir,btohqsg
I wonder how people in really big cities like New York  Tokyo etc commute. Itâ€™s ridiculously expensive to park there even though cars are so much cheaper,btohqsg
No one in their right mind drives to work if their office is in Manhattan,btohqsg
But you wouldnâ€™t drive  traffic is insane,btohqsg
Itâ€™s legit a dogâ€™s breakfast at rush hour.,btohqsg
You take a town car and do meetings and calls in the back,btohqsg
I got out of the car once in NYC  walked to the office,btohqsg
Or you take the subway to be quick,btohqsg
With COE in place we aren't,btohqsg
Chicago already doesnâ€™t put you in jail for murderâ€¦this will make NYC implement the same..,btohqsg
First time I take plane is to come Singapore work,btohqsg
Sometimes weâ€™re there. At Ngee Ann City ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No one give way = gridlock = funtimes..,btohqsg
The beauty of COE is that it limits the total cars on the roads  and you see even with COE we have so many jams and congestions,btohqsg
Ngee Ann city is a pain during peak hours,btohqsg
Honestly  some of these are cause of the drivers...,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why  park at Hilton ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
NGEE ANN CITY is for rich people,btohqsg
I just nearly got side swiped by a BMW today,btohqsg
Maybe scrap COE with a pay as you drive kind of system? I donâ€™t know,btohqsg
Cause that YP donâ€™t know what signals are and donâ€™t have awareness.,btohqsg
Nope. But doesnâ€™t know what mirrors are,btohqsg
