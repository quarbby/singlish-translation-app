"PLEASE READ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èThe delta variant is mainly PCR negative.The individual is mainly asymptomatic or mildly  symptomatic.The changes in the lungs occur gradually.When most of the lungs are affected   the patient becomes breathless & dies within  few hours.Chinese workers in India  returned home from India via Nepal. On arrival in Chongqing  initial tests were all negative. But the doctor still had doubts  so he had them  CT scanned.The workers were found to have lesions in their lungs and confirmed to be India's triple variant  proving that the Indian super variant can evade current tests. Most of the checkpoints are based only on ordinary tests.Hong Kong and most countries do not force immigrants to undergo CT scans  nor do they have sufficient time and resources to do so. If the estimate is correct  it is believed that the fifth wave of super virus outbreak will soon appear in Hong Kong and the world. The message from Singapore: ""The virus is back."" This time the virus is more lethal and tactical and camouflage.Infected people do not cough or have fever. ""This time the symptoms are joint pain  weakness  loss of appetite""; As a result  the mortality rate is higher  the time to reach critical is shorter  and sometimes there are no symptoms  so be careful. The strain does not harbor in our nasopharynx region  so there are no longer prodromal symptoms such as loss of smell or taste. It attacks the lungs directly  shortening the time of onset. In many patients who do not have fever  X-rays show: moderate chest pneumonia. Nasal mucosal sieve tests often show COVID 19 negative  and more and more false throat nasal examination results  (COVID19) means that the virus spreads directly to the lungs  causing acute respiratory distress (hypoxia) from viral pneumonia. This explains why it has become so much more acute and deadly  and fever may have turned severe. Please note: ""Avoid crowded places "" ""Keep a social distance""  ""Wear a mask"" and ""Always wash your hands with hand sanitizer or soap."" This epidemic will be several times more deadly than the last one  and we must be more cautious and ""never neglect it.""Remember! Please forward to relatives and friends  be sure to double good epidemic prevention.",btohqsg

I like to give stock picks before they move. This is to give everyone a chance to cross check with their own strategy if it‚Äôs in line with their philosophy. Everyday there are so many buy sell calls everywhere. Fb  Instagram website  blogs  telegram. Newbies will follow blindly. Pls don‚Äôt do so. Dyodd! No one is God and no one can make right calls all the time. So always make a trade if ure comfortable.,btohqsg
Jiayou to all traders . Huat,btohqsg

Agree. Intel is not doing good.,btohqsg
This telegram chat is very good. Because everyone gives stocks call. So that one can open up their chart and cross check with their own indicators or strategy. Winners are those who take responsibilities for their trade and actions. Only losers blame this and blame that. Blame people for giving stock tips and lost money. People like this will never grow and will forever be stuck with this downward spiral loser mentality.,btohqsg
To summarise  take responsiblity for your own trade üòÇ,btohqsg

U have a winner mentality. Keep doing what you are doing  learn  gain and grow. Trading is a journey .. people need to have a trading plan. Every day is a new day to fight this battle and each day learn something and become better.. jiayou,btohqsg
