check with the merchant if they are ok for ONE PAYMENT  but multiple accounts to scan points,btohqsg
those high margin merchants.. e.g. beauticians... all very willing to cooperate one,btohqsg
I invest in brokage but it doesn't consider as a transaction or a saving it is considered as advice. The most I can only save 100 to 200 the rest is on investment,btohqsg
In this case I think Uob stash might work for u. As long as gradual increase per month,btohqsg
But it only limit up to 100k at 3 percent interest,btohqsg
When u see there state 5 percent interest in actual u calculate it gives only 3 percent,btohqsg
If u can‚Äôt clock card spend each month your choices are very limited,btohqsg
Saving acc in the bank I just don't want to leave it unattended I rather it earn some good interest also,btohqsg
So what if I have more than 100k when stash limit is 100k what should I do with the rest ü§î,btohqsg

Hi guys for the Poems 5.9% promo  is it only for new customers to poems or new to the cash park feature?,btohqsg
I think sooner or later u will face block like mind. Better to park longer.The hsbc account from last night 820pm until now still blocked no call from fraud dept. Called hsbc Hotline 3 times still no return call. Tomorrow going to ask RM for help,btohqsg
I do it every month. I already went through enhanced due diligence with the banks already. So far no more issues. Touch wood.But I never do last minute one. Always have 1-2 days buffer.,btohqsg
Just remember once kenna questioned. Always tell the truth. Always provide all information requested. Never ignore them.,btohqsg
The department questioning u don‚Äôt care about you playing rewards. They only want to ensure your money is clean.,btohqsg
Its good to have 1-2 days buffer coz I was talking to a CSO from another bank and some banks aware of your money movement as the transfers do will have footprints. Which is why some customers are not able to fulfill some promo conditions because it is basically a merry-go-round.,btohqsg
Yup some banks do not like u merry go round  they will just serve notice and close account without providing reason. It does not mean money clean then no issue.,btohqsg
