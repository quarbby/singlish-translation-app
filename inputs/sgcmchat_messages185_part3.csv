yall tgt mah  and also Im guessing yall are pretty young? so he knows if he makes threats like this yall cnfm scared,btohqsg
ya sia heard he OPEN FOR SHOOTS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è,btohqsg
We even told him we can delete the photo we apologised nicely,btohqsg
He still said no no no you get in now I will whack your face,btohqsg
IMO this is the right thing to do if someone asks you not to take a photo of their car. But he should not be rude or aggressive,btohqsg
Probably one of those siao lang pple,btohqsg
he shouldnt have threatened yall  but j be cautious next time ah bro,btohqsg
Bro every 13 year old twitch streamer and her dog got tattoo now,btohqsg
or maybe he do something wrong  or running from someone/authority so when see ppl take photo then become paranoid and threaten to whack,btohqsg
"ending a sentence with ""cuh"" tells me all i need to know",btohqsg
Possible. But theres thousands of cctv on the roads and in car parks so he‚Äôs already nailed,btohqsg
"not exactly ""nice"" to randomly take videos of people's cars",btohqsg
especially at a random ass mall like Nex,btohqsg
yeah youre right but maybe he nv think and just running or sumn haha just a guess  could be completely off,btohqsg
Thats why i dont agree with this ‚Äòdont take pic of my car‚Äô bs. Like bro  out on the road a few thousand people already got me on cctv and dash cam,btohqsg
dw bro not that deep one@ArghMeinGottjust boomer,btohqsg
i think you're missing the point i mentioned before,btohqsg
just because it isn't your thing doesn't mean it isn't going to piss off others,btohqsg
the best solution to all conflicts is to avoid it in the first place,btohqsg
in this case  no cure  straight to the conflict.,btohqsg
I happen to think that a person taking a pic of someones car is most times nice,btohqsg
Unless he had an ulterior motive  why second guess something like that?,btohqsg
If you go on Instagram  YouTube  or other social media platforms you will realise that many people also do the same,btohqsg
just because they can do it doesn't mean it butters all the breads,btohqsg
just because someone can run into traffic and yell racial slurs on socmed doesn't mean you can either,btohqsg
if you want to have a platform,btohqsg
It not nice it not bad is just what the owner of the car think,btohqsg
Some will appreciate it  some wont. Its not illegal  i say do what you want  and be nice to each other  problem solved,btohqsg
don't walk inside random ass carparks to shoot,btohqsg
We just pass by and saw it,btohqsg
go to a proper meet and take pics,btohqsg
yes snapping videos in public and whatnot isn't illegal,btohqsg
but you aren't putting yourself into other's shoes,btohqsg
there will always be someone that doesn't like it  factor that in and don't act surprised when it does happen üëç,btohqsg
bro most of the time non car enthus wouldnt think that youre taking photos of their cars because you like the car  they would think that youre doing it with malicious intent,btohqsg
when someone takes photos of our cars  we would think its nice but not to (most) non car enthus man,btohqsg
Sorry but if your car is just parked there and some guy in a car park who obviously isnt a parking warden just stands there and takes a pic and walks away minding his own business im pretty sure what you are saying above is not true,btohqsg
i suppose you can put it this way,btohqsg
someone brings a dslr to your hdb block,btohqsg
starts taking photos of every unit,btohqsg
Taking photos in corridors is perfectly legal. But the moment it encroaches into private space this now becomes a legal issue. So your analogy doesnt work,btohqsg
i don't think you get the jist here,btohqsg
why wouldnt it be? nowadays so many vigilantes trending ppl car for the smallest reasons so maybe the person had their guard up?,btohqsg
The sitting on and leaning on and touching to me is flat out disgusting,btohqsg
I think if a person were to think this way by default when someone takes a pic of his car  issues lie more with him than the person taking the picture,btohqsg
but hes saying that he didnt really like the random ppl taking photos of his car. thats the point though  because maybe the person that took photos of his car liked the car or wtv but that wouldnt be the first thought that comes to mind if youre not a car enthusiast imo,btohqsg
once again  it's not about whether it's their issues or not. it's in general,btohqsg
nowadays ppl paranoid bro  what to do,btohqsg
i think you should look at it from a broader stance as opposed to just your own standpoint,btohqsg
we cannot change how ppl think  but we can change our actions,btohqsg
