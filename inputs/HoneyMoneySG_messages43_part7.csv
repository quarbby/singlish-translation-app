it might already have been approved  check your hsbc app to see if they issued a virtual card,btohqsg
Then go with traditional discount broker. Like td or ibkr,btohqsg
if dont care about all the free gifts  it‚Äôs better to go with IBKR right?,btohqsg
oh yes it is!! thanks for letting me know this,btohqsg
Trading platforms are heavily regulated in Singapore under MAS purview  so they have more hurdles to go through.But sure if you prefer peace of mind  go with older/traditional brokers like IB for international markets,btohqsg
Visit üìà Interactive Brokers:https://hmsg.link/ibkrto find out more about their pricing and markets,btohqsg
hi Q - if i wanna purchase online tix  is it better to pay via citibank cash back or rewards card? tyvm!,btohqsg
Hi  is it worth to buy latest SSB at 2.8%?,btohqsg
Is webull really 0 commission ?Anyone can share with there is any other fees ?,btohqsg
All these kind of 0 commission brokers typically sell your liquidity.You might realise you are the last to clear the queue when you are placing a BUY or SELL order.,btohqsg
Let say I buy 1 share at 305 for Microsoft for example ‚Ä¶I only pay $305 ? Don have other small fees ?,btohqsg
Typo .. I edited my message,btohqsg
So webull works like Robinhood .. actually I not very concern how they do backend,btohqsg

As a reference  one way sia to Jakarta in economy cost 8500 miles,btohqsg

Hello  does anyone know if the hsbc entertainer account that comes with a hsbc credit card have any expiry?,btohqsg
Meaning uob evol ok or not ok?,btohqsg
fromhttps://milelion.com/2022/07/14/review-dbs-altitude-card/it seems like insurance isn't ane xception?,btohqsg
Insurance is not an exception even for DBS Altitude Amex cardsFrom the article:What transactions aren‚Äôt eligible for DBS Points?A full list of transactions that do not earn DBS Points can be found in theT&C.I‚Äôve highlighted a few noteworthy categories below:‚Ä¢ Education‚Ä¢ Government Institutions‚Ä¢ Insurance‚Ä¢ Non-Profits‚Ä¢ Hospitals‚Ä¢ Utilities‚Ä¢ Gambling‚Ä¢ Top-ups of prepaid accounts (e.g. Grab  YouTrip),btohqsg
I think Entertainer account is valid as long as your HSBC Advance or Premier is valid,btohqsg
FYI I get 5% for paying SingTel bill thr apps and online both get 5% every month.,btohqsg
It is good if you want to park emergency fund into something safe and liquid. SSB is guaranteed by SG govt and can be redeemed and get back your fund by the 2nd business day of the following month.,btohqsg
I took a look at Maybank FD bundle promotion. Seems like there's a catch. We need to deposit an amount into a Savings account first  then we can only deposit up to certain amount in FD to have 3.9% for 12 months,btohqsg
I'm not sure the amount deposited in Savings account need to stay there for the same 12 month period  or can withdraw once FD starts. If can withdraw  then there's no opportunity cost. Else  the effective IR is lower than 3.9%,btohqsg
i read before for Maybank FD bundle the EIR is around 3.65%,btohqsg
Funds deposited into the CASA Account (‚ÄúDeposit Amount‚Äù) will be held by the bank for the same periodas the Time Deposit from the date of deposit is made and will not be available for withdrawal duringthis period of time (‚ÄúEarmark Period‚Äù). For the avoidance of doubt  any withdrawal of the DepositAmount during the Earmark Period shall result in the corresponding termination of the Time Depositunder this Promotion.,btohqsg
Thanks for highlighting. I have missed this info. Will include in the next update if Maybank is still there,btohqsg
do you know if spending in Best denki Taka qualify?,btohqsg
Is shopee has extra charge if we make payment by credit card?,btohqsg
