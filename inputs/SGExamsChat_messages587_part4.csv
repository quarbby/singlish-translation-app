So 6k still got cpf charged but after 6k tht money is urs to keep,btohqsg
as in if you earn more than 6k  your cpf calculation is still as tho you earned 6k,btohqsg
Like 1.2k is still taken away,btohqsg
so if you earn 10k  still take away 1.2k,btohqsg
then employer still contribute 17% of 6k,btohqsg
Ehh rlly? idk ss feels like the more relevant subject,btohqsg
