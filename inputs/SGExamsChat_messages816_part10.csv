text,group
Half way thru the sem he gave up on making it coherent cuz the prof cmi and basically just transcribed whatever gibberish the prof said,btohqsg
Come exam none of what he said came out,btohqsg
So my friend wrote 50 pages of gibberish for nothing.Such is life,btohqsg
This sounds like me coz i believe i will lose out not writing,btohqsg
Idk if its just me for STEM but,btohqsg
I see people doing that and im like,btohqsg
Arent you just copying what the prof is reading off the slides,btohqsg
Thing is this is the same prof I have a seminar with at a Y3 Elective mod,btohqsg
Sometimes i do that coz the lecturer talks so fast  i just type w/o seeing if it is on the slides or not,btohqsg
So I got screwed for 2 mods,btohqsg
Then when i revising  i realise there are duplicates,btohqsg
Type is fine  personally I think that still works,btohqsg
Na bro the Profs ramblings was not even in syllabus let alone the slides lmao,btohqsg
But people write on their ipad...,btohqsg
Jiayous…i believe students can survive w a poor lecturer,btohqsg
That one is a Prof.. not gonna dox him but that mf also teaches Medical Humanities at LKC med lol,btohqsg
I do that in my math class last time,btohqsg
But usually more for keeping myself awake,btohqsg
And figuring out how does the logic work,btohqsg
Normally I figure out the logic part in the readings,btohqsg
i find the prof explaining helps me connect the lines of math,btohqsg
that’s what i write down mainly,btohqsg
Then come seminar it's a fight to understand the narrative the prof tryna put forward,btohqsg
or i rehash the notes/slides into my own notes,btohqsg
Personally i think after 2 years,btohqsg
i should just stop copying notes and just go straight into looking at questions,btohqsg
because my notes feel like i just writing down the same thing as the lecture notes LOL,btohqsg
I can most likely find existing research on that topic thay basically explains and condenses the subject to an understandable level,btohqsg
Use that and form bs question that makes it sound like I am a subject matter expert,btohqsg
for physics it’s like if i’ve time i’d just comb through the textbook but otherwise im cross referencing the lecture notes  what the prof says and what section they correspond to of the book,btohqsg
so many textbooks available for one field,btohqsg
I do the same just that my screen isthe application for course withdrawal,btohqsg
tbh QM 2 and anal mech the notes are quite comprehensive,btohqsg
just maybe the extra derivation steps are worth writing,btohqsg
bc the notes won’t just go step by step yk,btohqsg
can’t speak for EM but just refer to the griffiths textbook,btohqsg
damn imma need to download that before the sem starts,btohqsg
Na bruh I have it filled out it's just my hand is on hovering over the submit button,btohqsg
I actually subjected some poor soul to that in RP. I was in lesson when I received my NTU offer and was told I have to accept or reapply next year. So I ask my classmate to press the button which after he press he ask for what so I said u just press the button for my withdrawal,btohqsg
i unfortunately did not have that luxury,btohqsg
it was either accept NTU or pay for your own uni at SIM or some shit,btohqsg
Originally I didn't have to because I had the promise of NS for deferment,btohqsg
Something I lost also.. last year,btohqsg
it’s the EM bible like fr,btohqsg
I feel like is from china ones and from india ones thoughhh,btohqsg
But yea the china ones are more apparent,btohqsg
honestly i feel like as long as not singaporean,btohqsg
i cannot understand their english HAHAH,btohqsg
Oh yea his name was fillipo,btohqsg
nah prof battatio i cannot also,btohqsg
