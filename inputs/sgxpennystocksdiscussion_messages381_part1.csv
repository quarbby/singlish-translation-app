Anyway true storySomeone pm me ask for a tip. Knows him to play big positions profits could be in 10k regionTell me he can pick up and hold.I say ok. Send him world vision website donate 1k I tell uClearly he didn‚Äôt. And not happy about itMy point being: if u can trade and profit/ loss in region of 5 digit what is 1k?I don‚Äôt earn anything. It may not be genuine kindness as some friends pointed out. I‚Äôm not bothered  the underprivileged get food whether money is sincere or notHowever for someone who is used to getting something for free  $1 price is $1 too much.I have no intention to shame as I‚Äôm not naming anyone. My point is simplyThere is always a time to pass it on. Kindness don‚Äôt have to wait for a certain net worth to commence. The best time is now right now. If u decide to be a leech all your life you will wonder why no good things happen to u. It‚Äôs a cycle it‚Äôs never about what u get but what u give. Returns are always magnified when u don‚Äôt expect them,btohqsg
Bo. Holding very little counters in sgx,btohqsg
I think those that huat from ur analysis shld show some gratitude..may I suggest u put the link to the organisation and pinned it ?,btohqsg
We can only return the favour by giving u the good karma,btohqsg

no updates on market but more for love of humanity. I wish to appeal to my subscribers if within your ability to make donations whenever possible because the world really needs more help in many aspects. This is a recurring child adoption programme in third world countries  not exactly giving them the opportunities we enjoyed but at least level the playing field slightly and give them a fighting chance to improve their lives.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg

Maybe if a call rocket then I come rob. Don‚Äôt want people feel obligated,btohqsg
How come need to choose child to sponsor... Not in general ?,btohqsg
