Ah yes  964 Carrera RS true beauty,btohqsg
Absolutely  964 will be the dream haha,btohqsg
IDK BUT THE 2.0 AT SGCM GOOD ENOUGH,btohqsg
Stage 1 the 2.5 faster than 4.2 R8 even w awd,btohqsg
What about the 992.2 gen 3 AMG line  spec 2 RS,btohqsg
I read 992.2 idw read anymore-R,btohqsg
wah his new hse damn sick sia,btohqsg

funfact: Porsche made the W124 500E. The Mercedes W124 was meant to be a executive car with a 3.0L I6 engine to be placed neatly and perfectly without too much room to spare. W124 obviously had other 4 Pots like the 2.2L and 2.0L. The less premium 300E was the downsized E280. Just so happened  the W124 came with the same generation 5.0L V8 from the 500SL. There was actually a high demand for the 5.0L V8 in a W124 further down the production years so Mercedes decided to grant their customer's wish and put the V8 into the W124. However  the 5.0L V8 was too huge for the W124 and Mercedes engineers couldnt fit the it in  hence they recuited the engineers at Porsche to help them with the application of the 5.0L V8 in the W124. Porsche engineers had to cut up the front to make it wider so that the engine could fit and for a balanced driving dynamics  the rear was widen too. Therefore the 500E was actually a totally different chassis compared to the W124 we see on our roads. Sadly  the 500E never made it into Singapore as all were made in LHD.And so thats the story on how Porsche actually made a Mercedes!!,btohqsg
very interesting though  this is a Slantnose bumper,btohqsg
But they didn't convert the whole thing to a slant nose,btohqsg
sorry please enlighten  X50 is a powerkit,btohqsg
i mean the kit doesnt come w a new bumper,btohqsg
The car threw me off at first  thought it was a 964 but the signal lights gave it away,btohqsg
this migjt be a slant nose,btohqsg
behind the door panel there is a vent... there are present on slant nose,btohqsg
Not for the 918 spyder and p1 hahaha,btohqsg
if u can own one  i think petrol no need care one,btohqsg
bro  honestly at this point anything you tell me I also will believe you.-R,btohqsg
Best blend of performance  sound and weight. V10s too heavy  v12 too high pitched,btohqsg
if you have the plate  go check LTA LOL,btohqsg
Exactly. So many types of V8  screaming V8  rumbling V8  unreliable V8  multi purpose V8,btohqsg
But the fuel tank placement is accurate to a regular 930,btohqsg
so its a slant nose convert,btohqsg
Not similar to the R8 V8 tho,btohqsg
V12 high pitched sound hits different. But I agree with v8s being the best overall package,btohqsg
eh stop throwing random numbers HAHAHHA-R,btohqsg
Its more of a a R8 V10 without 2 cylinders,btohqsg
I will not express my opinion,btohqsg
Because I believe I will surely be thrown out of the chat or attacked by lovers of a certain car,btohqsg
I think SG too small for turbo,btohqsg
sat in a C4S and Turbo multiple times,btohqsg
even the C4S is abit too powerful,btohqsg
no fun one u step 3 seconds u at speed limit liao,btohqsg
If I'm going for the driving pleasure  rwd it is,btohqsg
thats why you should buy an Aveo5 Manual,btohqsg
C4s to get launch and drag times or you go for a turbo S for that,btohqsg
Floor also cannot reach speed limit,btohqsg
why put 10 down when you can put 0,btohqsg
I stop following ferraris after the 488. Just a pipe dream  might as well dream about the halo cars hahaha,btohqsg
Your civic no fun cause no spoiler,btohqsg
A car is still a car,btohqsg
Yup different one from the rs5 and r8 v8,btohqsg
Ok  why don't you get a vios?,btohqsg
