thats a skill issue on her part,btohqsg
homework is so trivial that i can do it after the teacher collected it/j,btohqsg
whenever i heard about those ppl i just laugh,btohqsg
actl no its not even funny just regarded lol,btohqsg
Josh is from my sec sch,btohqsg
or someone jus made this shit up,btohqsg
what's legit is that i just dropped a new post on matchondria,btohqsg
don't call my gen the skibidi toilet gen,btohqsg
i feel like ik some ppl who use their brains actl,btohqsg
Tbh i feel partly gen issue partly just being at that age ppl do stupid shit,btohqsg
ngl i used to be mad at my ex bsf for treating me that way but i also mad respect at how she managed to pull it off and i admit defeat,btohqsg
Coz looking back every gen got their own dumb shit,btohqsg
I'm running low on ideas for animal of the week,btohqsg
broad category but that gives me smth to work with,btohqsg
i have so many ideas but i need to focus on some first,btohqsg
Ngl ml is fun with friends,btohqsg
wait isit same girl that ik,btohqsg
Valerie should i do the animal of the week on cute dog breed or the fierce fierce kind,btohqsg
finally an appropriate context to use this stickee,btohqsg
i legit wanna make some joke about genes,btohqsg
Eh atp it's not if but when she gets preggo,btohqsg
"""oh fuck who is the father""",btohqsg
ok but last year promos legit got 1 qn damn funny,btohqsg
"can't wait for ""i love cjc jokes"" rae to respond to this comment",btohqsg
"""Bob and Sally have a son  William  William's blood type is O  but both Bob and Sally have B blood type. Bob is worried that William is not his son. Using appropriate diagram(s)  prove whether Bob is correct.""",btohqsg
when this came out in promos i was ðŸ˜­inside,btohqsg
I see the qn iw to pastaway,btohqsg
spoiler alert is that there's a 25% chance their kid has the O blood type,btohqsg
so based off blood types alone we can't deduce that william isn't his biological son,btohqsg
Bro what is this beef with sgexam disc,btohqsg
but then of course not much people in this day and age would use blood to determine if someone's biologically related to them,btohqsg
I got cursed to go back to tele,btohqsg
Like wtf i have been in sgexam longer than most of them bruh,btohqsg
have y'all heard of swallowed twins,btohqsg
ik its not the right term,btohqsg
then the child comes out is only 1 child,btohqsg
yea but its good enough haha,btohqsg
But got remnants of the other twin in the surviving twin body,btohqsg
so got this old woman many years ltr got like stomach pain and they thought shes preggy but then ended up it was her twin,btohqsg
cause the fetus in the uterus cant eat,btohqsg
but the remnants are really just... remnants,btohqsg
uh there's photosynthesis but my understanding is rabz cause its taught in y6,btohqsg
Its only cause the twin and the mother absorb the other twin,btohqsg
so in theory if its done completely then there's no remnants,btohqsg
Isn't there some kerbs cycle shit,btohqsg
I rmb hearing alot of ppl flame that,btohqsg
but like vanishing twins explained is that,btohqsg
and another twin thats like super weak and have a lot of deformities,btohqsg
I rpt 100 child of god,btohqsg
Its usually from dna deformities making it unable to survive,btohqsg
