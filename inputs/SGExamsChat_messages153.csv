This should belong to the O level group chat:@SGExamsStudies,btohqsg
Anyth at rest doesnt have any inertia,btohqsg
Inertia refers to at rest or in motion,btohqsg
No need to joke around... I'm not your sir,btohqsg
property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line  unless that state is changed by an external force.,btohqsg
To be honest I don't even know how to reply you  having never learnt it,btohqsg

The partial derivative exercises i've seen can't be GC'd on,btohqsg
I dont even know if i should do PD or continue phy,btohqsg
Why do i sense biasness in this,btohqsg
Seems like we have different definition of fun and necessities,btohqsg
PD seems to be an element,btohqsg
Within the intersection of fun and necessities,btohqsg
Why you suddenly want to learn PD though,btohqsg
My course seems to have a bit more mathematics than my liking,btohqsg
Seems like multiple schs got bio exam,btohqsg
Aka the three bio powerhouse schs,btohqsg
When did mi come intot he pic,btohqsg
Before i graduate the food already cmi rdy,btohqsg

It might be but is it relevant,btohqsg
Tell me something I don't know,btohqsg
‚ÄúYou dont know what you dont know‚Äù,btohqsg

Millennia institute isnt only for millennials,btohqsg
Hmm that‚Äôs if you walk straight and crash through lampposts and trees along the way,btohqsg

Express buses is not only for express stream students,btohqsg
that's when you make to the top 5% of normal MI then when you graduate and go ns they'll assign you to SAFTI MI,btohqsg
Must be why im not in army,btohqsg
The only MI i have is the alma mater,btohqsg

i talking about somone i know in my school for PW,btohqsg
yea  i was talking about myself :(,btohqsg
Im just feelin sorry for the person,btohqsg
At least you can recognise it,btohqsg
idk if its being self depricating tho,btohqsg
my pw grpmates say im not,btohqsg
but i feel i kinda am,btohqsg
Ya some ppl dont even recognise it,btohqsg
Even if u were  doubt they‚Äôd say it to ur face,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs ok to be useless as long as u did all u could,btohqsg
Eg it‚Äôs ok if those whose English not good don‚Äôt write much in the WR,btohqsg
As long as they make it up,btohqsg
i didnt do much of writing the wr but i did most of the graphics,btohqsg
Sounds like ur not useless then,btohqsg
my grp is all the hardworking ppl its hard to keep up,btohqsg
actl the entire class is hardworking asf cannot relate,btohqsg
Encourages u to work hard too,btohqsg
Imo the one that designs the graphics is the most impt,btohqsg
When‚Äôs ur meme pack coming out,btohqsg
i used to admin a couple of memepages soooooo,btohqsg
same bro i pulled my class down to 4th last class in cohort üòîüòî,btohqsg
my class topped the cohort even with me pulling that shit down lmao,btohqsg
I was sole carry out of my class,btohqsg
he probably the only one who did well in his class?,btohqsg
Perhaps the person who posted it is here in this group,btohqsg
I thought you are also a moderator of that subreddit? You didn't know?,btohqsg
Sub and telegram have different mods,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like different depts in a company,btohqsg
Oh okay. I thought you were the owner of everything,btohqsg
I see some juicy discussion going on,btohqsg
That will be the ruin of SGExams,btohqsg
[O levels] Is it ok not to have a rs/sex before jchttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iw8hwa/o_levels_is_it_ok_not_to_have_a_rssex_before_jc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
If you want to have it or not,btohqsg
I'm conservative. I don't do it before marriage,btohqsg
School is not a place to shag,btohqsg
School is  a safe to work environment,btohqsg
Please teach me your study methods,btohqsg
Ummm I‚Äôm using iPad to study,btohqsg
U do it before going toiler,btohqsg
Hopefully I get into a relationship when I do my PhD and get married after that,btohqsg
I no money for iPad :(,btohqsg
You can create notes with foolscape,btohqsg
No wonder I suck at exams,btohqsg
How old are u when u doing pHD,btohqsg
I think relationship during undergraduate is too distracting,btohqsg
Is mw the guy i know,btohqsg
Ipad has tons of writing apps of course,btohqsg
They come with yellow   white or black paper,btohqsg
U not weeb enough to realise,btohqsg
If he is fake   then how do you explain the morderator role,btohqsg
You can go for a walk or eat healthily,btohqsg
That helps you better in the metabolism or something,btohqsg
Make ur body healthy enough to study well,btohqsg
Actually a good tip that I never see often,btohqsg
How to burn out if I'm not studying,btohqsg
Third advice I would say is to manage your own time,btohqsg
Of course you can take a break,btohqsg
If I was studying I wouldnt be here would i,btohqsg
But you have to know when you should study more,btohqsg
And when you need a break,btohqsg
You can study for 3 or 4 hours,btohqsg
Then you can take 1 hour break,btohqsg
It's difficult to get into studying thou. K only have motivation on the day before the exams,btohqsg
If you are a person who wants to memorize something,btohqsg
U need to know what u r studying for,btohqsg
I think you have to find what best fits to how you study,btohqsg
I'm studying to take more exams in JC,btohqsg
Do you study better with visualization,btohqsg
Do you study better with vocal? Like reading?,btohqsg
Do you study better while moving around,btohqsg
Take more exams in JC? But you can't really do that many subjects in Jc,btohqsg
To not end up in absolute poverty,btohqsg
That's is an example of how you want to learn in your own way,btohqsg
Then take that as ur motivation then,btohqsg
Wdym. Isnt there still exams in JC?,btohqsg
Yes  but you cannot do so many subjects like in O levels,btohqsg
Oh. Im saying I'm taking Os to take As,btohqsg
I personally am into vocal and visualization for my studies because one I read something and I try to think how it seems like  then it would help me to understand,btohqsg
wah exam period everyone looking to destress,btohqsg
Most people I know dont even know what they want to do after they graduate from poly or JC,btohqsg
And if you are willing to learn  I'm sure you would be able to succed,btohqsg
tfw u no motivation to study even when youre likely to retain,btohqsg
You can also bring yourself an educational trip,btohqsg
I dont think I'll exactly retain,btohqsg
Like for example you can go to the National History Musuem to study the history of singapore,btohqsg
Or go to the art Musuem to explore the artist work,btohqsg
ya but i think i will,btohqsg
And maybe you can get some inspiration,btohqsg
Singapore education system doesnt give you the time to explore what you want to do,btohqsg
So likely to say  learning doesnt stop,btohqsg
Welp try to study I guess,btohqsg
and if u do be prepared to pay w ur grades,btohqsg
i took hbl time to get fit and explore my interests,btohqsg
U mm you can during your weekends,btohqsg
When I was in lower secondary,btohqsg
In university it is slightly more flexible  as in if you have to you can change to something else but you have to meet the requirements of the new course,btohqsg
weekend for doing mountain of hw bro,btohqsg
I went to the museum to see the history of singapore,btohqsg
lower sec damn diff from upper sec and jc,btohqsg
It's quite unfair that they force people to learn everything when one might only be interest in a few. They dont let you be passionate about anythinf,btohqsg
But I would normally do my homework everyday,btohqsg
I dont particularly like any subjects,btohqsg
idw be that guy but i cant help but agree lol,btohqsg
The problem in schools is that a lot of things are watered down,btohqsg
Don't let the education system stop you,btohqsg
execept hist and gp but i hate doing gp papers,btohqsg
For example mathematics in university is very different from school,btohqsg
That's a good thing. You can explore the nature and historical sites,btohqsg
cant upgrade skills if udh skills üòéüòéüòé,btohqsg
You can see with your eyes and study the nature,btohqsg
I mean when you do well in a subject  you think you can do that in the future but when you screw up  you feel like an utter failure,btohqsg
im interested in those but not as a career option,btohqsg
GP was easier than mathematics and the natural science in school  at least to me,btohqsg
Because the questions were well written,btohqsg
i only pass gp and hist barely for blocks and failed my PCM,btohqsg
In mathematics papers i can't even understand the question,btohqsg
Skillshare then use skillsfuture to upgrade,btohqsg
apparently my sch 2018 paper very cancer,btohqsg
I see. Well  if you feel that you are weak at that particular subject you hate  you  can go for alternative to help you better in your course,btohqsg
Your English and your math must be good,btohqsg
English because of how your speak and write,btohqsg
As long as your English is okay  not necessarily amazing or good  you should do fine. As long as your structure and arguements are there you should do fine. Maybe not top 0.1% but yeah,btohqsg
Math in some areas you need to calculate properly,btohqsg
Well  there are a reason why there are this part,btohqsg
dunnid calculate properly if u dont even know how to calculate ha,btohqsg
its a self depricating joke but ok,btohqsg
tfw i cant study and cant get gf also,btohqsg
as in for career im interested in other stuff,btohqsg
Do you even know what you want to do in the future,btohqsg
but w covid the industry damn shaky and my parents asking me to reconsider,btohqsg
YES I WAN TO DO COMPUTER SCIENCE BANDWAGON WITH 90RP EZ KATKA,btohqsg
Im liberal no one wants to do it with me anyways üòéüòéüòé,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't have a girlfriend...,btohqsg
Is it true that you think there are more than a million genders,btohqsg
If u dont know what to do in the future  just go CS,btohqsg
a true shitposter never reveals his own identity,btohqsg
i sexually identify as a bagillion bazinga jenders,btohqsg
or js be disappointment to everyone,btohqsg
At least you have some form of intelligience,btohqsg
theres no other weebs with that nickname,btohqsg
i forgot the sgexams discord existed,btohqsg
whats the point of joining the discord vc if yall not gonna talk at all???,btohqsg
i just see ppl huddled in a voice server then they just mute themselves???,btohqsg
then might as well study alone right,btohqsg
Maybe some people watch and follow their timer as well,btohqsg
But they have Alot of self discipline,btohqsg
I stream my notes when I study,btohqsg
I dont stream coz i get pressure :(,btohqsg
tfw u accidentally reveal ur search history,btohqsg
But im not sure if it is u,btohqsg
Eh anyone got notes/worksheet for pderivatives,btohqsg
V surface level intro to multi variable calculus  but it should do,btohqsg
It would be weird if it did  since there isn‚Äôt a section for Uni stuff,btohqsg
Has everything you need including practice questions,btohqsg
Now i just need one for thermodynamics,btohqsg
And i am good to go,btohqsg
Don't focus on it. Focus on the A level exam ahead  not the past.,btohqsg
Its easy to say that until u realise that overseas uni apps take prelims nd predicted score rather than wait for alevels to be over,btohqsg
But if you don't do well in the A levels  you won't meet the conditional offer and you are still out,btohqsg
What I'm saying is that it is pointless to do well in prelims and do terribly in A levels,btohqsg
That was never the contention but aite,btohqsg
At least for those doing NS  they have a few opportunities to apply for overseas universities,btohqsg
Time for girls to go NS then,btohqsg
They have leeway to resit for As too,btohqsg
Yeah  but how are you going to study for As in NS? People don't have the mood,btohqsg
Ik a lot of ppl who have studied and are studying,btohqsg
Most of them did well for As in NS,btohqsg
Yes  so I heard. But many have said it was arduous because NS makes them so exhausted and balancing time is so difficult  unlike in JC,btohqsg
Although those who went through JC would find it easier as they have went through the process,btohqsg
Yup its really not simple as it sounds,btohqsg
It depends a lot on your vocation.,btohqsg
If you kena combat then forget about it,btohqsg
But I doubt you can bring your A level work to camp and study while you are supposed to be working. And even in your break time I'd imagine it would be noisy and people wanting to talk to you,btohqsg
It depends.. if the individual is borderline and wishes to do better  it would be easier. But for those whose foundation is totally weak.. it‚Äôs gonna be a lot of hardwork for them (at night n wkends) after the ns outfield training,btohqsg
Yeah but you cannot guarantee it will be non combat  unless you get PES C or E,btohqsg
Yes.. harder to find chance. Unless the individual is really boss and able to dgaf to what his seniors and peers r gonna say haha.,btohqsg
That's why you need to wait until after BMT to find out what vocation you're in,btohqsg
Haha maybe he referring to those who r not so lucky,btohqsg
Mfw its 8 months and im still in BMT,btohqsg
Which would be too late to those hoping to retake A levels if they get a combat vocation,btohqsg
Meanwhile i have friend in music and performing arts vocation.. (is there such vocation??) quite senang ley,btohqsg
I think it is to boost the morale of the soldiers?,btohqsg
ü§£ hahahahaah!!! I was shocked when my sis told me that too hahhahaahahah,btohqsg
Why would u play music to boost morale of the soldiers,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs to directly contribute to the ministry of arts in sg?,btohqsg
Oh I thought they go around different camps to perform to boost the morale hahahaha,btohqsg
Yes this. Like directly contributing to that purpose,btohqsg
I think it is more for things such as NDP,btohqsg
HAHAHHAAHAHAH ya first tot that came to my mind too,btohqsg
Last thing i would want is random ppl coming to my camp to play music and me being forced to watch it during OTOT,btohqsg
Meanwhile every day I go there use phone until bookout,btohqsg
I would tilt instead of raising my morale,btohqsg
Which vocation r u in?? Sounds quite shiok,btohqsg
My friend from bio radio dunno what.. his allowance quite high,btohqsg
I think it goes according to rank,btohqsg
Wahts the name of that called?,btohqsg
Well  I doubt they have increased the allowance by a lot,btohqsg
Uhh ya whats CBRE stand for?,btohqsg
Do people have to address someone with higher rank as sir ALL THE TIME?,btohqsg
I tot sir is a very generic form of address to seniors,btohqsg
Oh  how frustrating to talk to them. Yes sir no sir I am good sir. Erh,btohqsg
Its only frustrating if u think its frustrating,btohqsg
Aiya it depends how close u r to them,btohqsg
U dun have to put in every single sentence la,btohqsg
So what extent does malay get used in the army?,btohqsg
last time when i was in taekwondo  the seniors = higher beltthen there was this sec 1 who was like black belt  and i join in sec 4 with white belt,btohqsg
I thought commands are all in malay?,btohqsg
Wow!! Haha bold question thou i would have this question in mind too,btohqsg
Are ALL commands in malay or only some?,btohqsg
Why a bold question? Nothing about race. Race and language is separate,btohqsg
Wow  you must be an expert at Bahasa Melayu,btohqsg
Knowing a few commands ‚â† expert,btohqsg
I thought they would speak full sentences in malay,btohqsg
Actually try learning a new language for real,btohqsg
Malay is not that hard to pickup,btohqsg
Yeah you don't have to learn an entirely new alphabet,btohqsg
Jawi is the written form of malay in arabic from my understanding,btohqsg
Well  malay is more traditionally written in jawi  right?,btohqsg
Do u write and converse in traditional chinese,btohqsg
Or doth i spake to thou in english,btohqsg
Traditional chinese is just a script. But I use trad. More often than simplified,btohqsg
An anomaly hahaha noth more than that,btohqsg
Im assuming u use simplified to converse w other,btohqsg
Coz most ppl dont use trad,btohqsg
Not really. Because many people can read both,btohqsg
Must be i hanging out w wrong ppl then,btohqsg
HK  Macao  Taiwan  many overseas Chinese communities uses traditional in general,btohqsg
Singapore is different. In mainland China most people can read both,btohqsg
Because they learnt it that way,btohqsg
Idu why care about other countries hahah when the convo was about local context,btohqsg
Even in Bahasa Melayu  they changed the spelling in the 70s,btohqsg
Yeah  Brunei widely uses jawi for example,btohqsg
in bmt are you supposed to shout for every single sentence?,btohqsg
I think some of us still do in traditional characters.. out of interest for the locals. As for taiwanese and mainland chinese nationales   they use traditional characters,btohqsg
btw what is a good score for aq essays?,btohqsg
Depends who. A lot of people in mainland China  particularly Guangdong  due to influence from HK  prefer traditional over simplified. Also many older literate people use traditional,btohqsg
I think I am underperforming if I want to do well,btohqsg
R u referring to history or gp?,btohqsg
Oh shit. I actually forgotten whats that. Ok bye n all the best,btohqsg
6-8 range is quite decent for j1,btohqsg
from my recent practices it's usually above 6,btohqsg
but then my first time doing I got like 4 for it,btohqsg
Hey u improved! Well so u still hve time to move up,btohqsg
Given 'back to the teacher' haha,btohqsg
U keep reminding of ur age haha,btohqsg
ya i messed up during my test though missed a good score,btohqsg
Gosh i dun even recallwhat it is,btohqsg
Is okay. U sound anyhow better than me when i was there? Lol,btohqsg
some of the younger gen got the ability to read traditional too,btohqsg
it's not too different  especially if u grew up taiwanese dramas with traditional chinese subs xd,btohqsg
one of the lesser known variants,btohqsg
Ya cos it interests them. Like my sis lor,btohqsg
my grandma used to speak a little,btohqsg
my impression has always been that it's malay with an english accent and hokkien loanwords,btohqsg
But some peranakan Chinese seem to speak more closer to standard Malay  likely because of influence from school (learning malay as MTL) or growing up,btohqsg
yeah  most are born in malaya after all,btohqsg

I was finding my calculator during my exam,btohqsg
I ran to jcube from the library to search for my card when it was in my jacket.,btohqsg

I couldn't find for mine but my teacher told me he would reprint it,btohqsg
Then did u do well as a result,btohqsg

Hi guys would like some help,btohqsg
My sir asked me to think of some team building activities that people can do over video calls like zoom or whatnot,btohqsg
anyone got any good ideas HAHA,btohqsg
hardly something nsfs will want to do together over video call :X,btohqsg
What about some quizzes  through a mobile app?,btohqsg
Mlbb team challenge then host on twitch,btohqsg
Losing team help winning team clean bunk for 1 week üòÇ,btohqsg
HAHAH interesting suggestion but i dont think my sir wants like other websites to be brought in,btohqsg
especially since he'll be in the call and all,btohqsg
Wah just on zoom alone i dun think got much can do,btohqsg
Definitely needa bring in other platforms to make it interesting,btohqsg
Ur sir not so zek ark later ask u all to conduct army training stuff on zoom ba,btohqsg
But sometimes video cast via zoom will lag,btohqsg
HAHAHAHHA no la he not so mean,btohqsg
later my sir complain how does this lead to team building,btohqsg
Then show all the army based movies lor,btohqsg
Then at the end do a QnA of sorts,btohqsg
Or who is who (which member in ur team is like which actor in the show),btohqsg
Help each other foster the sense of brotherhood,btohqsg
But i think teambuilding best is games leh,btohqsg
Then can wayang say got teamwork,btohqsg
