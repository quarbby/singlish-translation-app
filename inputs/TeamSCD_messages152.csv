Just only post like 5 min ago🥲,btohqsg
Pls drive with care ah tp actively on road,btohqsg
One route home see 6 tp,btohqsg
I have a question. Can someone explain to me  what is the actual definition or meaning when one ram/ramp someone's car.,btohqsg
Idk ram or ramp la. Whatever it is.,btohqsg
Because someone is spreading false information about me raming or ramping someone's car. So i want to make sure i  or that person knows the proper definition of what it actually means.,btohqsg
in that context should mean bang,btohqsg
like u hit their car or smth,btohqsg
So i hope whoever that sees this message. Better keep their fucking mouth shut before i make it into a big fussEVERYWHERE,btohqsg
Higher chance you rape the feller,btohqsg
People too free trying to step till my toe when i am shutting the fuck up.,btohqsg
This is soo damn low 😱,btohqsg
I saw one roc at sengkang,btohqsg
Purple one damnnn confirm air sus,btohqsg
hmmm didnt u let go of ur car long ago? how to ram 🤔,btohqsg
But air sus take so much space,btohqsg
🥹 my swift boot no space,btohqsg
I saw my friend brz added that 😱😱 damnnn,btohqsg
If i change 17 inch rims on swift will it look weird 😂,btohqsg
Just saw Singapore car in BKK 😱,btohqsg
Ya 😂 damn solid  jam like siao,btohqsg
ppl who say things about ppl not affording things and other stuff like thgat are stupd,btohqsg
Haha obviously knows nothing  Evos and S2Ks cost so much more than most European cars now 😂,btohqsg
but depends on where u live,btohqsg
This is cos of Supply and Demand  those JDM cars have stopped production long ago,btohqsg
alot of euro cars stop prod long ago no>,btohqsg
You need to compare similar cars that came out at similar times,btohqsg
One major advantage is JDM cars have smaller engines compared to European Ms and AMGs which do well in current climate,btohqsg
Another thing is most JDM cars produced are RHD and u can’t drive them in nations like the USA so LHD variants more rare meaning they go for way more esp since 70% of countries use LHD,btohqsg
Doesn't matter the reason. The main point is it is ignorant to assume all Japanese cars are cheap without any knowledge.,btohqsg
That’s why Australia got so many mk 4s,btohqsg
This is wrong esp since jdm cars don’t depreciate as badly as European. Can’t say Japanese cars are cheap they are amazing,btohqsg
That guy commented that to troll and you guys getting triggered over it is exactly what he wants,btohqsg
why not just ignore the comment and be happy with what you drive.,btohqsg
That's why my car is both JDM and euro,btohqsg
I'm perfectly happy with my cheap japanese COE shitbox,btohqsg
Haha i just commented thanks for your opinion and commenting with a fake account🤭😈,btohqsg
Your one not the same leh,btohqsg
His one is straight from evo 10 go down to evo 9,btohqsg
This is what I called sensible and clever move,btohqsg
Then i also go down to fd,btohqsg
This one is called stupid move,btohqsg
Fd more power than fc leh,btohqsg
But the popularity is also power leh  in a bad way,btohqsg
Wah hiace to Scirocco big step,btohqsg
Usually such people dont own a car or their parents paid for theirs,btohqsg
Roc's is a very nice looking car,btohqsg
I pick the fn cuz I don't really want a conti,btohqsg
Yeah don't like Conti tax 😂,btohqsg
But a 2.0 manual I would have seriously considered,btohqsg
But don't do it at midnight ah 😂,btohqsg
I actually still dunno what the stage means,btohqsg
Maybe I'm out of touch of cars technology haha,btohqsg
For you just drive normal and do servicing normally lo,btohqsg

Question i have is if ws says my camber cannot adjust.. then when they do alignment. Adjust simi? Hahahah,btohqsg
Didnt charge me for camber nuts tho haha,btohqsg
Try going to kenny or SIM huat to do alignment luh😁,btohqsg
Power this kenny. Since 10 yrs ago de forum see his name liao hahah,btohqsg
Actly now ok liao no rub. Just wondering if like stock system is non adjustable.. den alignment they fo what? Or they will install nuts to align the wheels but nv tell us. Covered under alignment $$ ah haha,btohqsg
Camber nuts are optional..need to pay one,btohqsg
Kenny in the business for beri long liao,btohqsg
Camber nuts are to adjust the camber degrees,btohqsg
Plus minus little bit of camber  toe in toe out etc…Sure got some free play,btohqsg

Anybody know any workshop that knows how to remove silicone from CF wings and redo?,btohqsg
It's the wing to your car body the joint silicone issit,btohqsg
So they silicone those joint area,btohqsg
Depends on installer. Sometimes they only silicone the hole that the bolt goes through. Cos the rest of the wing will be on 3M tape,btohqsg
But i think any bodyshop should be able to do,btohqsg
Might as well go try autobac,btohqsg
I rather pay premium to let autobac do such,btohqsg
Then boot area become fish tank,btohqsg
It's the spoiler and side panel joint area silicone because previously rain water went in made the screw or bolt or whatever rusty and stain my body than workshop silicone it but anyhow one lar now i want find another workshop that knows how to remove without damaging my CF and redo,btohqsg
Can standby de-rusting and spot welding whole car experience,btohqsg
Ya any body shop will do,btohqsg
sorry to say the silicone really like dog bite,btohqsg
Hope u get a good workshop to restore the spoiler former glory,btohqsg

But such job is way like an amateur job,btohqsg
Not even scraping off the residue,btohqsg
The workshop use the gun than use finger do i also blur,btohqsg
Shld have file off the excess properly sio,btohqsg
Cb $2.8K wing like that anyhow do,btohqsg
By right they pump the silicone n will either use scrapper or at least finger to glide thru,btohqsg
Finger also not this rabak ba,btohqsg
This one is like kana dog bite,btohqsg
no la  finger will like that cos don't dare to get finger dirty,btohqsg
The other spoiler he sell me broken fiberglass,btohqsg
It's not easy to make it very nice.,btohqsg

Ur top coat is a goner,btohqsg
