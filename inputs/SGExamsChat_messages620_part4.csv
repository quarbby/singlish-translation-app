need take 1 bus from bedok mrt,btohqsg
Physics: The department in general ranges from pretty good to absolute dogshit. The notes are not bad tho but the papers are very killer :( Be prepared to fail every single paper until promos. For Mid years the pass was 40% and the distinction rate was 3%. For Promos the pass was 60% and the distinction rate was 8%. Some of the topics tested were also not in syllabus so yeah.Chemistry: Literally the most stacked science like actually damn good. The papers are very similar to a level standards but it is much more difficult for organic chem as compared to physical chem. Teachers are very willing to contribute and overqualified imo. (Literally go look at EJ website :D)Biology: Generally pretty good. Notes are very comprehensive but exam papers are damn anal and kinda weird. (10m qn on how microscopes contribute to studying of biology).Econs: Dont take it. If u want to take econs dont come EJ. But in general the econs department ranges from good (a select few) to like disappearing because they dont turn up for lessons. Notes are horrible. Lectures are disappointing and do not fully cover the notes + does not fully cover the syllabus. Pray for a good teacher and you should do well for econs. Practice!History: You will never be bored in history. They are super fking entertaining. It is one of the few subjects that have alot of live lectures. Their comments are damn good for practices (Legit gives feedback for both bad and good). Alot of discipline is needed to do readings by yourself tho as there isnt really content lectures/tutorials. Generally everything is done by the students. Sample essays are also posted onto google classroom  done by your batchmates.Geography: Geog notes are damn entertaining. Also live lectures damn fun. For our batch however we literally only have 2 teachers but the 2 teachers are damn stacked. Plus the like amount of practices they give is damn alot and the teachers for extra practises they do stuff like marking extra work a few hours before the exam and still going through for us. Like honestly they are damn good and they have a collected book of every model essay from 2017 to now.Lit: i dont take lit. but i heard that the lit chers for your batch is damn good!GP: lectures make me want to kill myself. Ranges from good teachers to dogshit. Hard to get an A. They dont give enough practises so u legit need go do urself. Content not provided UNTIL ur in J2. A shit ton of packages tho (Although the naming damn confusing). Packages include model essays  abit of content (Student compiled). Singapore context stuff. Alot of extra practice qns but not used in class or gone through.PW: We dont know because yall get new teachers since almost every pw cher in ej is leaving the school :(  although some of the good teachers are staying behind.Culture: Cancel. Tiktok. Basketball. Ulti. House.Council: basically useless they do nothing they suck their own dicks. Alot of their initiatives proposed by council is for themselves only  if they even get anything done. They havent came up with anything unique YET (Please come up with something.) Getting in is legit a popularity contest  regardless of JAE or JIP  as long as u can make friends in a quick span of time can get in.Segregation: Most overexaggerated bs imo. Highly dependent on what class u are in which is literally out of ur control. They do not band by JIP JAE for classes  CCAs everyone has the same shot of getting in. It only is like this at the first few days of orientation  beacuse no one knows one another  even the JIP students. Generally JIP students do interact with JAE if they are willing to. Alot of JAE students go around saying they cannot make friends/cannot relate because they are JAE. Imo is not really the case especially for my class. Unless u refuse to even initiate a conversation there should not be any segregation at all.For the last 2 points  it is generally very dependent on ur batch. Because each batch differs.Campus: Damn nice.,btohqsg
