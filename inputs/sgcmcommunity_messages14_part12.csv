Seen too many of such people around,btohqsg
Good morning Mr Xun! You have lovely dogs!,btohqsg
Thanks Mr Anwo  you have a lovely dog too!,btohqsg
Hard to say for all bah.. but I‚Äôve heard they transact fast.,btohqsg
At least from the one dude I know who sold them his car.,btohqsg
Mileage tempering for many sports cars is hard. For instance  in order to tweak bmw mileage you need to authenticate with many components not just in the DME. This is good. But makes things complex. In England  tempering is a criminal office. Can go to jail.,btohqsg
Tempering with intent to mislead a buyer in a sale is.,btohqsg
Or  to under declare a car value on importation for customs purposes.,btohqsg
But Singapore generally safe bah üòÖ,btohqsg
Tempering with intent? What other forms of tempering is considered okay?,btohqsg
Since you said it this way why do you want to temper,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs difficult to tweak the mileage,btohqsg
Just walk away le  but sometimes when the car and price really attractive it's hard,btohqsg
I would walk away. Very scary when I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know,btohqsg
I thought maybe I could buy a 2nd hand car  fix it up  replace all wearable parts  then put it on sale with all the servicing done and replaced  but I feel I would be penalised by what I did because buyers would siam the car thinking it must be problematic that's why replace so many parts,btohqsg
I think being an honest car dealer would suffer actually,btohqsg
Especially the costs of replacement would jack up the market price of the car I'm selling  buyers wouldn't be convinced to spend that kind of money,btohqsg
I guess to summarize  such market doesn't exist and unable to,btohqsg
We see it in apple care etc too. Nothing wrong with it per se.. quite a question of one‚Äôs risk appetite. A bit like buying insurance? down to each person‚Äôs cost/benefit analysis in a way.,btohqsg
E.g. I am a 3rd owner of vezel hybrid  which my agent lied that it's not a phv car and mileage is 60k when I took over. If I replace all parts  paint it according to the color buyer wants  sell at $62k  would anyone want to buy it from me? I'm sure no.,btohqsg
Overseas yes for collectible cars  they restore  mark up and sell.,btohqsg
So many retired female Teachers üòÇ,btohqsg
Most agent wan trade in at 10k difference so that they can maximize earning,btohqsg
Got dealer told me most customers take them for a ride (literally)  there's a risk of damage if too many such customers drive then walk off,btohqsg
My mechanic friend used to advise me  never ever test drive a second hand car from dealer if you are not genuinely interested to buy. Once you get into an accident  you will have to pay for all the damage incurred.,btohqsg
Especially if the accident is staged rite,btohqsg
Guess they will purposely rectify other damages that might not directly link to the immediate accident.,btohqsg
Maybe I'll start as a 2nd hand dealer without any physical office  then see how it works out by being an honest seller lol,btohqsg
I guess there will be people that are price sensitive but I think there are people whom will be willing to pay a little more for a trouble-free experience. Consider something as simple as transfer of ownership.  Even with bank order  the transfer of ownership is usually done only after the bank's order is cleared. That's already a risk. Perhaps one can consider something like a 3rd party Escrow service.,btohqsg
"With apple care  we know what we are getting and everything is listed clear. However  with regards to the specific advertisement that I responded to  it stated ""1 year in-house warranty on engine and gear-box""  then when nego  the warranty becomes an add on item and cost.",btohqsg
That‚Äôs also a good point. Inclusions / Exclusions.,btohqsg
If possible  please share your experience! Maybe I can come and part-time with you. Guess in this case  it is not so much about the volume of business but rather the fact that you see a gap that can be fulfilled.,btohqsg
"Take the ""in-house warranty"" with a pinch of salt. The techs  garages and dealers are all partners.Now guess who isn't a member of this circle of trust?",btohqsg
"I understand that the ad space on SGCARMART is limited but one could put ""1 year warranty on engine+gearbox addon"". That would work too!",btohqsg
Honda ZR-V announced for EuropeThe ZR-V is currently set to go on sale in the European market in 2022  so we won't be seeing it on our roads any time soonüò∞üëâüèª React with üò¢ if you are bummed out that we won't be seeing the ZR-V on our roads any time soon!üëâüèª React with ü•∞ if you are looking forward to the ZR-V launch in Singapore!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
Make sure to get your back end really sorted before starting üòÅ (parts access and costs  workshop for touch up jobs  proper records of verifiable parts  financing costs etc) otherwise your holding costs will be a bit siong,btohqsg
True true. Its like the SGCARMART warranty thing. Would you see it as a advantage over others? Some dealers are promoting that as an addon as well. They can buy for you.,btohqsg
Shit. I realised that this SGMCART's chat. I hope I don't get called up for a kopi session for stating this.,btohqsg
Start by helping friends source for cars as first deals. That sure beats opening up a biz even if virtual waiting for the first customer.,btohqsg
You know when suddenly you‚Äôre no longer in this group chat üòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
There's one that I have seen online. HEW Motor. I think he is a one-man operation and he does something similar. He has tie-ups with his own workshop but he replaces quite a bit of stuff before reselling.,btohqsg
I'm not in the position to comment as I've never read the fine print of this warranty programme.,btohqsg
Like putting the ownership to a 3rd party for holding  so that the seller cannot chood pattern?,btohqsg
"And the warranty is usually additional costs for next year cos the workshop usually ""unable"" to fix the problem  then when you fix it outside  they tell you the warranty no pah Keh",btohqsg
Escrow? Yes. Arrangement which 3rd party temporarily holds money or property until a particular condition has been met,btohqsg
I no experience as a dealer lol but perhaps can use consumer mindset to guide myself lol. It's a very small gap no one wants to risk lol cos mostly trusts issues.,btohqsg
Can work but honestly I've seen dealers working out of mscps and no offices having a hard time to sell the cars they have,btohqsg
Guess one of the biggest mystery is what license is required so that one can take ownership of the car without increasing the transfer count. Understand the outlay in cash to purchase the car first but transfer count?,btohqsg
"Because the customer already ""degrades"" your unit in comparison to a dealer who has a brick and mortar office and forecourt",btohqsg
It's like buying veggies from small shop at the corner or going to cold storage,btohqsg
