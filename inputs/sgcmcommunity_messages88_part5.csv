to be fair i feel ownership wasnâ€™t long enough to know the full extent of reliability,btohqsg
The w212 e class is honestly the best choice for your requirements as long as you buy a good unit,btohqsg
Just that it won't offer the best driving pleasure,btohqsg
I was looking at a beetle but they donâ€™t produce that anymore so Iâ€™m afraid the old ones will have a lot of problem - E,btohqsg
Don't get me started on Miata variations,btohqsg
The parts actually not hard to find one,btohqsg
I think the vert beetle looks damn cute leh - E,btohqsg
Have you thought about a bmw,btohqsg
But you won't have a great driving experience,btohqsg
Makes me feel like Iâ€™m a hamster in a running ball - E,btohqsg
Aiya if you scared of going workshop,btohqsg
It's the golfs and roccos we are familiar with that have so many issues,btohqsg
Like this cause the beetle very round hehe,btohqsg
This also makes a lot of sense,btohqsg
can walk arnd see other shops,btohqsg
Especially used car on 2nd COE,btohqsg
Going workshop to mod my car ok  not leave it there for a week to repair,btohqsg
To see what will be your next car ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
I think I meant it as paying a lot to maintain it bah. I donâ€™t mind going to workshop - E,btohqsg
Go workshop means your car will be stronger ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Prepare 10% of the car price for wear and tear,btohqsg
You'll be fixing up a lot,btohqsg
Just don't go turf city buy Citroen can liao ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So in your opinion  Beetle is a no no ah?,btohqsg
If you want to upgrade your driving experience from the copen,btohqsg
We can advice but if you want a beetle,btohqsg
I would suggest using the greatest platform SGCM,btohqsg
And test driving one unit of each car first,btohqsg
Gives you a base feel of every car,btohqsg
My shortlist a lot of vert alrd HAHAHAHA - E,btohqsg
See which one talks to you the most,btohqsg
Then see which cars you liked the most,btohqsg
Must close your eyes and drive,btohqsg
And find more units for that car,btohqsg
And if you feel one with the car,btohqsg
What has been catching your eye lately,btohqsg
Then see which unit gives you the best value with price  condition (PPI is a must) and spec,btohqsg
Hmmmm honestly all that caught my eye are like eyecandies. Cannot afford one HAHAHA,btohqsg
But now need to be practical so diff story.,btohqsg
Sgcarmart inspection more catered towards dealer,btohqsg
Who can fix up Wear and tear,btohqsg
Can look out for common issues,btohqsg
Here I put the sticker you wanted to,btohqsg
pls donâ€™t write off the is250c,btohqsg
all must ppi though  and lexus can go garage r,btohqsg

I think beetle suits all girls haha,btohqsg
PPI only leh won't cost more than 150,btohqsg

You touch anything also will visit doctor,btohqsg
