Hi there! Is Instarem Amaze + Mastercard the best way to make a large foreign currency (USD) payment? Tq,btohqsg
UOB lady's with the selected category,btohqsg
depends on what is your foreign merchant mcc,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have a UOB one card and absolute amex on the way  if I occasionally want to spend in JB (Ringgit)  online spend (USD) and Thailand (THB). Which currency card should I apply for for these 3 currencies.1. Amaze?2. Youtrip?3. Other recommendation?Thank you!,btohqsg
"Wait  what?What ""currency card"" should I apply for these 3 currencies? What does that mean?",btohqsg
It sounds like you are implying each currency will get its own card. That's not the case. You just have the opportunity to open multiple wallets for different currencies,btohqsg
And each wallet is linked to just a single cardThe benefit of holding money in the respective wallets is that you are holding them at a particular rate. But this shouldn't really either be considered a pro or a con because FX is volatile and unpredictable. Unless you have a strong feeling that a particular currency will strengthen vs others...?,btohqsg
Fwiw  i feel all the multicurrency cards are all about the same (especially in terms of rate). There are plenty of comparisons online.For amaze I suppose you mean amaze wallet (since you have no mastercards)  they give 1% in form of points for fx txns. Cannot store myr.Youtrip cannot store myr and thb (i think).Other recommendation is probably Revolut because you can withdraw money out (the rest are all stuck inside)To store myr u need ichange (but I usually transfer to tng wallet because ichange app is... buggy),btohqsg
SDIC doesn't cover privileged banking accounts  IIRC,btohqsg
"I generally feel multi currency wallets are overrated  for the following reasons1) SGD is not a ""shit"" currency (i.e. Leaving your SGD in your bank account  even if earning 0% interest  is no worse than holding MYR and earning 5% p.a. on it)2) you don't have a crystal ball that can help you predict whether a particular currency is likely to go up or down vs other currencies3) even if you did  there is opportunity cost in holding a currency (or anything  for that matter)4) piggybacking off the example above  what actually is the benefit in holding a currency vs SGD  considering the general strength and stability of SGD? Imagine you ""hold"" MYR to lock in the rate. You go in 3 months and you've lost 2%. Of course it can go the other way  but hence why I said #2What's more important? Good FX rates with low spread  low fees/surcharges",btohqsg
Yes I do meant e-wallets. I do have a debit FX with Mastercard as well. Does topping up with the Mastercard have any benefits? Or can I top up using UOB one card to clock the 2k spend or absolute to get the 1.7% cash back?,btohqsg
Most e-wallets don't allow top up from Amex so using absolute isn't even an option,btohqsg
You only have that option for grab. And UOB absolute only pays 0.3% on grab top ups,btohqsg
Hi guys I‚Äôm new here  but has Citi rewards + amaze been giving you the 10x points? I have only been getting 1x for quite a while üò¨üôè,btohqsg
You spend on air ticket n hotel?,btohqsg
No  I tapped my amaze card link to Citi rewards at restaurants  hair salon  groceries‚Ä¶ I have only get 1x point,btohqsg
How do you know you get 1x point? When was your last transaction date n its mcc code?,btohqsg
Because after I noticed the points  I stopped using for a while  made note of the points before making another transaction and calculate the diff,btohqsg
There was some technical issues between 19-23/24 Jan. perhaps you want to check were those missing points credited back to your account already?,btohqsg
"Hi all  any1 faced issue with using uob ladies to book flights? I keep getting ""card not accepted""",btohqsg
Last transaction was 5411 ( Jan 29),btohqsg
Did you exceed $1k spend within current statement month?,btohqsg
not sure if this helps but i obtained full points for 5411 on Jan 27,btohqsg
Ohhh  guess I call up the bank and check w them,btohqsg
you calculate using excel right the distribution of points?,btohqsg
Then I have no idea why it rejects  if it is JAL website. Perhaps chat assist with UOB to see any decline transaction.,btohqsg
Suggest you do one more grocery transaction on next Monday n check on tue or wed again.,btohqsg

Hi experts  anyone know any withdrawal limit daily for moo moo back to bank account?,btohqsg
Fully agree with 1)  especially while we continue to live in inflationary times  and the overall policy of the MAS since the 90's has always been to achieve gradual appreciation.,btohqsg
any idea how CC late fee interest are calcuated?isit1) daily average balance2) normal simple interest,btohqsg
what happened? if borrow money  might as well use balance transfer. much cheaper,btohqsg
