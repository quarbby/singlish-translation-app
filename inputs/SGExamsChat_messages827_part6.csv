Is there a nickname for mi like rp,btohqsg
many ppl come out with many different nicknames,btohqsg
Someone once said another nickname for rp is regenerative poly,btohqsg
The cir in mi more simillar to jc or poly,btohqsg
MI is JC rejects basically what,btohqsg
those who scored bad enough that they cant enter any poly except ite,btohqsg
I think rp got all the rejects name also,btohqsg
Now with RP that has changed liao,btohqsg
So MI is just JC rejects,btohqsg
So we are where they go when they graduate,btohqsg
Might even be the same school,btohqsg
How about I school your butt,btohqsg
Yes pls. Reminds me of the time they did a poll on which high school in the US Taylor Swift should perform at and the top vote was a school for Deaf Kids,btohqsg
Where is my uni KPOP concert experience sigh,btohqsg
GEM explorer to Ewha Woman's University and then just hope a Kpop group festival is occurring during your stint,btohqsg
Maybe I need a wig too while Iâ€™m at it,btohqsg
I dun think there is a stipulation that I need to have a vagina to qualify for exchange in a woman's university,btohqsg
Oh wait they do accept male students for exchange,btohqsg
Only issue is that I dun think they do physics,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have to map physics modsâ€¦ I think? Arenâ€™t BDEs counted for mapping as well,btohqsg
Yep it's the easiest. But tbh if u just wanna map BDEs just do a GEM discoverer,btohqsg
Forgtten about 1 thing.GEM explorer matches by GPA.,btohqsg
I didn't say there wasn't a way. U can try GEM ambassador but to qualify it is recommended you take LK5001 and LK5002. In addition u will also have to take BU5643 when u are on Exchange,btohqsg
That sounds cool except for one thing,btohqsg
Not that its hard but the amount of effort i had to put in was more than any effort i put into my core mods lmao,btohqsg
I mean u just have to do that and then u can pretty much get a Minor in Modern Languages as LK5001 and LK5002 done in NTU then u match LK5003 AND 5004 in Ewha and when u come back to NTU just take any Language Level 1 Mod and u are set.,btohqsg
