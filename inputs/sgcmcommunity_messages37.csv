can you make a poll on car brands as follows... 🤔i like MAZDAI like Volvo,btohqsg
I like Audi  Porsche and BMW!,btohqsg
Ferrari and Aston Martin also super nicee,btohqsg
yes make a poll on the various brands,btohqsg
I like AG - Alfa Giulia,btohqsg
why the car choices so weird one,btohqsg
I think cannot fit all in one poll  max 10 choices,btohqsg
let's see how testy this can get...,btohqsg
Should put the era date too,btohqsg
Diff make got diff nice model leh,btohqsg
ya la only can choose one at end of the day,btohqsg
how to put poll so many,btohqsg
Then pick one or two from each country,btohqsg
lazy la siao put so many countries,btohqsg
^i learn from mr pete one,btohqsg
no no good job. that is how you make people talk. the emotional ones will blast out,btohqsg
Cannot  sir. High sales don't mean best brand,btohqsg
tata would be top 10 then haha,btohqsg
Toyota sells much more than Bugatti. Is Toyota better than Bugatti?,btohqsg
Maybe in making commuter cars yes,btohqsg
dont mean better. i mean display the choices to let people chooce,btohqsg
But in pure technology and engineering  probably not,btohqsg
this is the hardest choice to make,btohqsg
i also dk which one to vote,btohqsg
yeah i also wanted to choose more than ONE but not allowed,btohqsg
Again  how to determine? Most websites and sources use sales numbers as a measure of popularity. And most companies with more affordable commuter cars nag that spot,btohqsg
I shall go with the Bavarians as I have a lot of blinker fluid,btohqsg
only e46 and g80 have CSL,btohqsg

that is why they have to do the volvo is life slogan,btohqsg
i think everyone got soft spot for volvos,btohqsg

how about doing a poll like this?Which car brad is most boring...1. Toyota2. BMW3. Volvo4. Mazda,btohqsg
to sound like you are fair,btohqsg
so if anyone says BMW we know... 🤭,btohqsg
Now this is a hard one. For mainstream cars Toyota more boring compared to the others  but then you bring in gazoo racing while Mazda has nothing as of now about from the mx-5. Not taking into account past cars like supra and rx-8,btohqsg
that is outlier you are saying bro,btohqsg
we can only say in general.,btohqsg
Yes me too! I love Bus  MRT  walking,btohqsg
one or two brands dont change impression of people on brand,btohqsg
I agree  but when I start thinking of general  I also start thinking of these cool cars they have,btohqsg
The point I'm trying to make essentially is that every brand has something going for them,btohqsg
Something they're good at making  and something that everyone will have a keen interest in,btohqsg
They just make metal boxes now,btohqsg
eclipse should be a sports car not a suv,btohqsg
that’s equivalent to toyota making the supra a crossover,btohqsg
Imagine a supra crossover Mr Tang,btohqsg
are u implying ur old age?,btohqsg
would probably be X1 powered 🙈,btohqsg
Mr Tang  I would like to remind you that the admins are the ones who give out the prizes. I'm sure you would like to save some money on tints or earn some money since you're spending enough on grabs whenever your Subaru is in the workshop,btohqsg
