Scanned through some Medical counters and Medtecs chart looks superb.Yesterday PA at closing was incredible with straight flip $0.210 at 5.06 with big stacking action right after too.I believe they will be the leader for today / this swing rally up. Judging at the Market Depth. The Sell Q up to $0.220 is big but after that price  the Q resistance is really small.IMO  medtecs will definitely gap up today and I won’t be surprised that it can open above $0.220 at all.Usually UG and TG moves together with Medtecs  but lags a little? Hence  can watchlist these too.Also  on a Micro level  OEL ($0.008/$0.009) is one to watch out for. Have noticed some buying recently.Good luck today,btohqsg
Now covid in China shifted to Inner Mongolia. Shanghai  Beijing mostly cleared. Industrial will rebound  maybe dairy  agriculture or coal affected,btohqsg
Taken a small position in Didi. Waiting for authority to impose a fine and reinstate the apps n accept new accounts.The delisting n new listing may bring in good profit  but holders may need to hold a few months.,btohqsg
Anan looks to base at current support level 24/25. I guess they waiting for sellers and all contra pressure to dry out before trying to push higher.In Q to collect at 24  25 still in no man’s land now . Let’s see buyers / sellers come to take control,btohqsg
Will Mencast continue to chiong today... Gogogo,btohqsg
🎉Pika World Bite-Size Update - 8 June 2022🎉🕹Target is sending a chilling message🧨Consumers appear to be defensive  and investors have to ask if this is sufficient to cool inflation and how it will hit companies in their following fiscal reporting. It is the second time Target has been cutting their guidance in the past few weeks.Profits are expected to decline as they cancel orders and reduce prices to help offload the massive inventory. Indeed  it is not a rosy sign as the mega-retailer had warned that its inventory had risen by 43%  given that customers are shifting their spending away from goods and moving towards services more pronounced than they had expected.It keeps Pika World on the toes on any sign of further cool down in discretionary spending. After all  the US is primarily a consumer-driven economy.💊The spiral effect from Target💣Wall Street has been quick to reflect the problem of Target to other retailers such as Walmart  Costco and TJX Cos  which have underperformed during the trading days. Indeed  as these companies have rapidly built up their inventory  a genuine concern was slashing prices down to clear these stocks to hurt profitability and margin. Moreover  cancelling new orders may also signal a fall in further revenue and a general decline in consumer spending.On a macro level  global central banks are also pursuing a less stimulative stance on monetary policy and are likely to dampen consumers’ spending.🎙From the desk of Yellen: High Inflation is not acceptable!💰You’ve heard her. Indeed  the Treasury secretary is loud in signalling that inflation remained stubbornly elevated and that the Biden administration is ready to battle the prices to protect Americans’ pockets. She also reflects on the supply chain problem and Russia’s war which had created a large imbalance in energy and food  contributing to the woes of inflation.Pika World will be focusing on Friday’s CPI data for further insight into the inflation narrative.It is 8 June  Wednesday  9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a wonderful and peaceful day ahead!,btohqsg
