wait if u grad in 2020,btohqsg
If thats the case  why do we categories schools by tiers/prestige if we simply say its all individual effort,btohqsg
if minister say raffles bad sch means raffles bad sch,btohqsg
All schs are gd schs like the way all schs are bad schs,btohqsg
All schools ae good schools. By that logic  all schools are also bad schools. 🤠,btohqsg
Dont worry MOE buddy system will save us all,btohqsg
individual effort does play a part la but i feel that ultimately the environment and resources of the school plays a bigger part in your educational outcome,btohqsg
Sigma mentality is not gg jc but u priv candidate alvl and do it within one year,btohqsg
The only benefit is not pw,btohqsg
The top few with a grand alumni network base + resource pools,btohqsg
I mean i dont think jc matter too much. I think uni is more imp,btohqsg
Ye but how do we get to uni 😊,btohqsg
maybe its the reputation of the students la,btohqsg

If u wanna go international  acsi is a better bet imo,btohqsg
Thats JAE  its a different case,btohqsg
IP first 4 years so mucb time to do ur own shit,btohqsg
Doesnt acsi produce like half of the world perfect ib score or something,btohqsg

Yea so if u get a perfect score  u can go almost anywhere,btohqsg
Huh no. You can go anywhere,btohqsg
