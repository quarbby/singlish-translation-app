🚀Pika World Daily Updates- 26 Nov 2021🚀🎙The Fed has Spoken🔭The minutes by the FOMC meeting on Nov 2-3 showed Fed officials' heightened discomfort on the persistent nature of the inflation. It comes at a time when the Fed begins tapering its bond purchase. The move is in a critical junction as President Biden is also looking to fill in vacant seats at the Fed.The views shared by the officials is that the prices increase as a result of the reopening pressure primarily and could be temporary. Nonetheless  there is apparent uncertainty by the Fed officials on the degree to which the inflation is transitory and might take a longer time to subside.⌛️Supply Chains Pressure🛢Without a doubt  the Covid-19 Delta variant had made supply chains fragile and supported a high level of demands for goods which further pushed up prices. This can be seen in energy prices as well as nominal wage growth. In addition  higher housing rental costs have been a formidable pressure on inflation as it becomes more pronounced in several parts of the economy.Therefore  there is a consensus to reduce the bond purchase by around $15 billion per month so that the Fed can adjust the federal fund rates depending on the economy's trajectory. Uncle Powell has been a storyteller in convincing the market that interest rate hike is not on the card for the near time. Despite this  minutes did show some members looking forward to a faster rate hike.⚖️Next FOMC Meeting  Dec 14-15💰The December meeting will be a critical moment  especially after the November jobs report and the CPI data. Suppose we continue to see the rise in wages due to a poor labour force participation rate and elevated consumer prices  market participants are likely to price in a rate hike in June 2022 or earlier  given that tapering would have to begin faster.Moreover  a remarkable payroll report and inflation will push the case for an acceleration of tapering. And if that comes  Pika World will be updating on our latest outlook.It is 26 Nov  Friday  at 7.30 am in Singapore and 7.30 pm in New York. We have come to the last trading day of the week. Markets will be trading till 2am in Singapore time. Pika World wishes everyone an enchanting weekend!,btohqsg
