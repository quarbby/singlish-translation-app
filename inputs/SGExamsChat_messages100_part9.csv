chill la u dont have to do whatever u learn in college also,btohqsg
I thought John is xmm lol,btohqsg
no offence but the whole 'we need ns for women too' is so cringe,btohqsg
if i were a dude i'll just suck it up and do my ns without complaining or even worse dragging women into the equation,btohqsg
i think you're missing the point here.,btohqsg
lol that's their problem  just cuz someone is being a dumb sack doesnt mean u have to drop down to their level,btohqsg
if i were a guy i'd jolly well serve ns and not try and push it onto women too,btohqsg
no one is pushing it to women,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s easy to say  I suppose,btohqsg
No one wants to do NS,btohqsg
guess no one has pride for their nation or want to protect it anymore,btohqsg
this one a bit extreme la,btohqsg
that's such a naive statement to make,btohqsg
if people forced u to do sth  the more likely u are to fight against it what,btohqsg
Everyone wants to protect their nation,btohqsg
But everyone would rather someone else do it,btohqsg
tbh even tho i complain abt NSi still take pride in what i do in camp,btohqsg
And if I could leave someone else to do 2 years work for me while I continue life  I would,btohqsg
May I take this moment to ask what have you done for the nation?,btohqsg
yeah i think its ok to complain  but taking some pride in what u do is nice too,btohqsg
what's the point of arguing all these,btohqsg
its technically allowance and not a salary,btohqsg
