bruhh dk anyt js admit lah,btohqsg
lol not like you know either?,btohqsg
bro istg when i hear abt,btohqsg
scare the living shit out of me,btohqsg
udk also then want talk what sia,btohqsg
Correlation =/= causation  even if it is true for some students not necessarily that being proficient at multiple languages is a zero sum game between the proficiency of each language. Tbh moe doesn’t release data on the average English scores for hcl vs non hcl takers so most of what we have is just anecdotal evidence.,btohqsg
cuz i got friends who got cousins thr,btohqsg
also one can actl argue that those who take hcl could be better in english cause ur grades have to hit a certain boundary to take hmt no,btohqsg
Idk ah lol. Maybe moe should release more data too,btohqsg
I wish they continued giving more exact details of the performance of each Jc and so on,btohqsg
Up till 2003 they used to reveal the number of students with 4 As in A levels for every single JC,btohqsg
Then soon stuff like even the top psle scorer they don’t announce,btohqsg
"anyway its very funny how ""gp bridging for jae students"" became ""hcl people not as good at english""",btohqsg
lol wat u tryna do sia. u sudd text smtg unrelated in here confusing everyone then when called out u tryna push ur own mistake to other ppl.,btohqsg
js putting in my 2 cents,btohqsg
NS life must be so boring for you,btohqsg
don't blame me for your confusion sia.,btohqsg
like its for jae students not hcl studentsi genuinely want to understand how@Jennywawaautomatically came to the conclusion that the bridging was for hcl students...,btohqsg
then blame who sia your mother ah,btohqsg
I wish I can use my WhatsApp stickers here,btohqsg
send him back to pri sch for comprehension skills,btohqsg
@Jennywawacan u explain or not i willing to listen,btohqsg
Hey it wasn't a conclusion. Just a speculation.,btohqsg
nah bro need go kindergarten first budden ltr blud go and teach the kids wrong things,btohqsg
go back to mother womb btr,btohqsg
go back to not even existing,btohqsg
@JennywawaJust so you know   an absolute majority of the IP batch take HCL and none of them are required to go to the GP bridging lesson,btohqsg
Being bad at English is because u are bad at chinese,btohqsg
U cannot be good at both at the same time?,btohqsg
its worse than my jump in logic in my gp papers eh cb,btohqsg
So HCL = bad at gp = need to go for gp bridging makes 0 sense bruh,btohqsg
Bro fr just dragged all the polyglots in the world,btohqsg
oic  so who goes to the GP bridging lessons then?,btohqsg
maybe cuz speaking from his own exp la,btohqsg
bro must be pretty bored tonight,btohqsg
The JAE students... As i have said in my original message...,btohqsg
Apgp is one of the easiest,btohqsg
Ngl I've seen people who are bad at English go for gp asap (or remedial),btohqsg
So you didn’t even read the first msg properly…,btohqsg
People who say GP is pure English skill,btohqsg
Will have a very low chance of getting A for GP,btohqsg
I feel like GP is just u need to know how to argue,btohqsg
In the end for a levels you got A?,btohqsg
"Which isn't a skill of ""who is good at language or not""",btohqsg
Some students I know also like that  didn’t like the format the sch gave for essays so just wrote their own style,btohqsg
Those who go for gp bridging are those bad at english like idk man,btohqsg
as in  I was guessing the HCL students among the JAE.,btohqsg
U just need to be understandable,btohqsg
but ok  if it's just all the JAE students then point taken.,btohqsg
theres o level eng class for j1 for ppl who failed eng,btohqsg
