one more question  which CC have one of the better FX?,btohqsg
Credit cards have fairly similar fx (3.25% + underlying card provider rate)  except for trust credit card (which is very close to Google rate),btohqsg
btw u should be looking at the rewards/cashback less the fx fees/markup  not just fx fees/markup only.,btohqsg
Any recommendation?I’m recently closed my evol card and swap it into uob 1 cc - trying “train” a saving habit with uob one.Not sure what to do after I spend the 500 on my uob1 cc.,btohqsg
Trust card if STRICTLY going by fx rate (0%). This is the way if you are strictly into cost minimisation in your fx spending. As others have said  if you want cc rewards on top  Amaze with a suitable mastercard is your magic bullet,btohqsg
Saw many recommended citi rewards with amaze. Is this one of the best way moving forwards?,btohqsg
one of the best for S$1k foreign spend in statement month  except for travel/transport and other common exclusions,btohqsg
the best is subjective. It's the simplest strategy for day to day spend.,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Some other Mastercards (UOB Lady's and OCBC Rewards) can earn superior mileage (6mpd) provided the right conditions are met. Also  Citi Rewards blacklists travel purchases so you have to bear that in mind,btohqsg
Hi! For KK hospital which card would be the best?,btohqsg
All hospitals now only left amex tru cashback unless u r a mile person then wait for someone else to give advice,btohqsg
How about the UOB absolute Cashback? Is it possible?,btohqsg
Does Citi rewards or HSBC revolution cards receive bonus points for gym membership?,btohqsg

My own experience I got HSBC Revo pts for AF and ClassPass monthly fee.,btohqsg

Hi all just got my first credit card and need some clarification. There are 2 dates on my statement:Statement date: 19th JunePayment due date: 15th JulyIs payment due date the last date I can pay for this particular statement cycle? And does the rewards systems resets at every statement date for a new cycle?,btohqsg
yes correct but depending on some banks take a few working days to process payment  best u pay 1 week before the payment due datesome bank reward system follow statement date  some banks follow month cycle  not same,btohqsg
yes due date is the last date that the bank receive payment without incurring late fee/interest  note that it may take a couple of days for payment to reach bank depending how u pay.Rewards system may follow statement month or calendar month depending which card,btohqsg
Hi all  usually when do u all receive the money from t-bills back..? Mine matures today n i used cpf oa to buy. Thank u.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  may I ask if we manually do a partial payment say around 1 week before the credit card scheduled deduction date of our SP utilities bill  will SP be smart enough and just charge the balance?,btohqsg
It might sound weird that i am asking this. Reason being that the bill due date is last day of month  and it could end up being charged on the next month instead.😱,btohqsg
Understand that DBS WC miles is pay out blocks of $5. If I spent $4.90 = 0 DBS points?,btohqsg
It goes back to the holding account  for eg UOB kayhian. Stays there for 2 months unless u use it to buy tbill or retrieve it out,btohqsg
O base  but earns 4.9÷5×9 = 8 DBS points bonus.,btohqsg
Hey Chris  can do an updated video for best credit cards to use for hotel wedding banquets? Need your hear your strategy 🙏🏼,btohqsg
If I may just give a quick inputFirst up  find the MCC of the terminal you are paying to. Hotel or Restaurant MCC? What other modes of payment the Banquet Manager accepts? Allows you to split payment?Then apply the relevant cards x 2 humans (husband and wife  or if family can help out even better).Then pay the banquet with the optimal cards on monthly basis.,btohqsg
and of course.. always ask this..Any discount IF YOU PAY CASH?to put it another way... if the banquet can be paid with cash and u get a 10% discount.. it might be better off paying cash compared to using credit cards,btohqsg
Sure  planning to do a series on all the big ticket adulting items,btohqsg
For the average mid-income Singaporean - is this credit card strategy for a hotel wedding banquet still the best/still relevant? Or have any become nerf-ed?,btohqsg
Still viable provided the hotel doesn't markup the fee by the credit card transaction fee...most important as said is find out the MCC used by the hotel / payment methods  then u can plan which cards to apply for / sign up bonuses,btohqsg
Had to go check what is mid income in Sg. LOL.  but yes this should work.  But i also heard some hotels got KrispayThe median monthly income from work was S$10 869 for resident employed households  up from S$10 099 in 2022. From 2018 to 2023  median monthly household income from work of resident employed households increased 3.1 per cent cumulatively  or 0.6 per cent per annum in real terms.,btohqsg
how long is the processing time to open a poem account? And how long does it take for the funds to transfer to the account?,btohqsg
