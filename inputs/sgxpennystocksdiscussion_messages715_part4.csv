Month Sept '22 was the worse month since Lehman Bro Collapse 15/Sept '08..me🙆🏻 lost approx. $5K - FYI,btohqsg
Why didn't you apply SL.. the unrealized loss is in your trading or investing stks?,btohqsg
When you are wrong on a trade or when market turns against you too strongly.Stop losses  although hard to execute  are necessary.Take the pain first because it’s probably the right but hard thing to do and we can still recover.Easy to preach this but hard to do when we are in the position.Important  it is. There will always be an easier market for us to win back the losses but if we are stucked in a bad position  it affects our mindset and the ability to win back when market comes our way.Let’s stay strong and help one another in our trading journey.IMO  our SGX market have potential to become way much bigger than we are as I believe as we will continue to see more foreign investments coming into our properties and followed by parking in equities  which makes total sense since it’s the most liquid assets there is.,btohqsg
Ya.. agreed👍.. that's why we always shared if blindly chase high & your loss is -50%.. needs +100% efforts to raise bk chasing price.. nvr nvr chase high if didn't practice SL but it's fine to avg.up if still holding  either win more more or lesser,btohqsg

Covid crash 💥 3 months before market rallied and during that period  so much was on standstill due to closed borders  pandemic focused battle whereas now 8 months drop so far already when borders re-opened  market normalisation  work normalisation. In fact   everywhere  GDP is expected to pick up due to this.For all we know  markets can’t keep up up up  down down down It’s ups and downs. We might see some bounce this month or the next.Let’s see  if it comes   it’s time for us to be back strong to fight back recent damages .PS: based on past data  market continues to pick up and go on higher after every crash.With inflation and all  more people to move money out from banks and put into other investments  that can generate better returns to battle the rising interests rates.Let’s see,btohqsg
