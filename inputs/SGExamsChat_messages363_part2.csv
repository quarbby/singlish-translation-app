Just came out of the amath exam hall,btohqsg
Ok no this one is def not if im an acads pro i m in ri,btohqsg
She did her A lvl math in 30 minutes hor,btohqsg
If not how to get A in a lvl,btohqsg
pls dun take me srsly to those who r looking!,btohqsg
It's time to take H4 like@chemcer,btohqsg
too bad he can't do Lorentz transformation,btohqsg
I am about to take psle,btohqsg
PLS DONT REMIND ME OF THAT,btohqsg
Gonna go ham on these kids,btohqsg
its been over for 3 days,btohqsg
and ive never felt happier for 3 days,btohqsg
I donâ€™t understand the quantum mechanics question,btohqsg
you know how to excite electrons,btohqsg
my H2 chem grades were like,btohqsg
is that actually how to excite electrons?,btohqsg
is that hving to do w resonance n stuff? lol,btohqsg
nope  chem resonance is part of orjanic,btohqsg
Physical resonance will make the electrons excited,btohqsg
We never really touch each other,btohqsg
Solve for natural frequency of electron by solving 26th-order DE ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
a lot of your atomic structure in chem is derived from physics,btohqsg
that shit is all phys LOL,btohqsg
but eh im not sure dont u guys touch it in QM,btohqsg
Everything is made of empty space,btohqsg
i think u touch it in QM2?,btohqsg
maybe QM1 already touch it lol,btohqsg
your head your family your life is all made of tiny empty space,btohqsg
This one i agree my head is made up of empty space,btohqsg
i just rmb my first QM class in uni,btohqsg
they went through hydrogen atom in detail,btohqsg
That means your brain is empty,btohqsg
You ainâ€™t thinking you are reacting,btohqsg
no. get out. F = dp/dt,btohqsg
Pls tell me whats the light dependent stage of photosynthesis,btohqsg
i gave up bio after sec 2,btohqsg
my mom scolded me for not knowing what it is lol,btohqsg
yea she took 30mins to explain to me citric acid cycle and i couldnt understand ANYTHING,btohqsg
rate is directly proportional to intensity(concentration) of light,btohqsg
so you guys like to memorize things like this so much?,btohqsg
STIMULATE ZE ELECTRONS IN THE PIGMENTS OF LIGHT HARVESTING COMPLEX OF PS2.,btohqsg
physics for people like me with shit memory,btohqsg
not possible. u have to memorize MI table oso,btohqsg
r u rly gonna derive the MI of every single object on the spot,btohqsg
r u srsly gonna triple integrate every fucking thing?,btohqsg
Yupp I love integrating into society,btohqsg
they give it to me lol like,btohqsg
uni isn't gonna throw us questions that require us to memorise,btohqsg
they deduct our marks with the difficulty of the question  not based on how good our memory is of a formula,btohqsg
im curious  in calc mods  for things like laplace transform are u given the table even,btohqsg
