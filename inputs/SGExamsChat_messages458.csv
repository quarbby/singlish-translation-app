Pixelcaracer  you grab cars and customise/race them in a 2d form,btohqsg

I mean there is only so much you can talk about a bus honestly,btohqsg
Btw y‚Äôall saw the new busses we getting?,btohqsg
I have a classmate attracted to buildings,btohqsg
It was a eye opening fetish for me,btohqsg
that time  me and a group of friends was near IMH  he looked at that building and i saw the wierdest face he ever made,btohqsg
"bro then started mumbling about... ""i love that building""...and the rest of us was like...da heck?",btohqsg
I think u will like this one. Is almost the same as that,btohqsg
u cant get the same feel on the new buses,btohqsg
which one? A380? A320? boeing 737? boeing 747? boeing 787? boeing 777?,btohqsg
the last 747 will still be flying for around 2 decades,btohqsg
I saw the Korea air one in Korea,btohqsg
that remind me...give me a sec,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs the one that I travel on most frequently nowadays,btohqsg
nothing can beat the scoot airlines pokemon themed ü§©ü§©,btohqsg
too bad  this design was infamous for something else,btohqsg
Well the last design they did was the A380 in SG livery,btohqsg
my eyes are blessed seeing this,btohqsg
lucky u I never got the chnage,btohqsg
idk why but this livery js makes me idk sad HAHHAA,btohqsg
qatar's world cup themed design looks okay too,btohqsg
Any of yall ever wondered why there are only pics of this side of the aircraft?,btohqsg
Cuz the other side is BA,btohqsg
idk if it‚Äôs gone for good or bad,btohqsg
Lets play a game  guess what plane this is,btohqsg
I have a very sad story behind this plane,btohqsg
good qn I still cannot identify quickly,btohqsg
It played host to one of singapore's earliest known events,btohqsg
u that old to fly on this?,btohqsg
but i could have flown on this plane model,btohqsg
the last A310 was sold in 2006,btohqsg
That plane i posted was SQ 117,btohqsg
one attendant got pushed off or smtg right,btohqsg
sorry the bus legit old Sia HAHAH,btohqsg
I used to binge watch those plane crash / incident docu(s),btohqsg
This photo shows the same plane..going to its last resting place,btohqsg
it‚Äôs crazy how things have evolved,btohqsg
but boeing did a good job on the 747 considering it was earlier,btohqsg
SQ 117 then registered under the AIrbus code of 9V-STP flew with singapore airlines for another 10 years,btohqsg
before being sold to another airline in spain,btohqsg
Actually most of the accidents are not related to the plane itself,btohqsg
More on maintenance   pilot error & sabotage,btohqsg
the one that crashed in the mountains,btohqsg
Fucking selfish rescue workers so many would have survived,btohqsg
"The Airbus A310 had a chassis name of ""N443RR"" after 9V-STP",btohqsg
The plane was eventually scrapped in a american military base in 2005,btohqsg
All planes eventually have to be scrapped,btohqsg
SQ 117 lives on...as 9V-STP  the singapore airlines chassis code was given to a Airbus A330 in 2010,btohqsg
buses and mrt history is much lesser,btohqsg
for airline buffs like you and possibly me,btohqsg
It list down every commercial plane ever built and its historical operations,btohqsg
