A new credit card user here  how do i know when to pay my due statement for my credit card(FYI an UOB credit card user),btohqsg
In that case probably no rewards will be given. Any idea what percent of losses from capital ?,btohqsg
I believe you meant Qatar? Uob ladyâ€™s 6mpd,btohqsg
should be 0... inject $4k get back $4k since investment didn't complete,btohqsg
Ic thx but that will also mean no vouchers ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Go to the cardIt will say statement due date pay before that date,btohqsg

When the statement comes  remember to pay inFULLand don't be late.,btohqsg
Now current my statement due is $0,btohqsg
Yes the app will show the amount due once your statement is ready,btohqsg
does anyone know the Jan2024 HSBC EGA Promo details?,btohqsg
For us shares transfer from ibkr to webull  anyone know which DTC to select?,btohqsg
do note that 3.7% can and will probably change over time  but I'm considering this. hsbc latest is 3.8% to end Jan on incremental balance. ocbc is total balance.,btohqsg
"May i ask what is the meaning ""incremental"" balance?",btohqsg
I withdraw after the shares bought was updated. Now donâ€™t know entitled theVoucher or not haha.,btohqsg
May not have yet since the last promo is valid for Jan too?,btohqsg

Quick question to my fellow members here: My mortgage is under 2 years lock in period under the fixed rate of 1.15% is ending this month and the current floating / fixed rate is quite high as compared to what I have been paying. Should I be using my CPF OA to reduce the loan quantum when I go for refinancing?,btohqsg
I have tried Revolut trust and wise. Link to alipay,btohqsg
might increase your accural interest. but then again  you have been enjoying the 1.1% savings from HDB loan..,btohqsg
Current Lock in fixed rate of 1.15% is from BOC for my private property.,btohqsg
shag. i think not much choice here.,btohqsg
Nice  mine is 1.2% and revised to 3.6% back in Oct 23. I refinanced from UOB at 3% with promo 2k+ cash + Dyson air purifier (under 900k loan),btohqsg
Sounds like a good deal mate. Not sure if banks are still offering similar rate of interest. Will check this out.,btohqsg
Can tryhttps://www.redbrick.sg/. I used them for my property loan and they were able to get some good non publicly listed rates. Saves you the hassle of reaching out to each and every bank also.,btohqsg
Agree. Their response time is also very fast,btohqsg
Actually that 2k++ cash is meant to offset the legal fees   which I paid 1.8k. So I had about $500 back,btohqsg
Bigger loan amount can nego for better rates  pay down loan after u lock in ur rates. Jus make sure u r allowed to do partial prepayment without charges/penalty,btohqsg
Fixed now around 3%  so either way it's better to reduce loan amount as much as possible,btohqsg
3x your current mortgage will impact cash flow,btohqsg
Agreed. Installment doubled up due to rate hike,btohqsg
If had to 3x your mortgage would then do CPF + shorter tenure and pay off faster,btohqsg
Hi guysI hv a questionNeed yr expertiseMy SA is 81kMy MA is 44kMy OA is 800My age is 49What is my next step?,btohqsg
By age 55  you will not be able to meet FRS and your OA will be fully transferred over to RA with your SA. Do you have any ongoing mortgage? Even if fully paid  at age65  CPF board will initiate another transfer from SA/OA to RA for you to hit FRS. You can opt for BHS with property pledge to possibly get some cash  but it would means a much lower payout from age 65.,btohqsg
I bought a hdb unit fully paid all from OA,btohqsg
hi just wanna ask if i can hold 3 credit cards with secured application,btohqsg
You can manually transfer OA to SA every month to get higher interest,btohqsg
Earn as much as you can while still having some balance to enjoy life.Can consider top up 8k / yr to cpf for tax rebate and savings depending on your tax bracket. (do this at yr end)Like SP said can pledge property for FRS.Investment actual still have 10 yrs  safer options blue chip stock  govt bonds  small amounts.,btohqsg
Yup done one that alrd eversince i bought the flat,btohqsg
As long as is from same bank. Then can share the same limit.,btohqsg
So what should i do before i reach 55 yrs old? Before RA kick in?,btohqsg
Since i dont meet FRS unless i do pledge right,btohqsg
So what can MA do before i hit 55 yrs old?,btohqsg
Pledge or use cash to top up.MA can only use to pay medical bills/ medical insurance,btohqsg
Since i can pledge i donâ€™t think topping up more cash on MA is a gd strategy. I donâ€™t know? Is it?,btohqsg
A lot depends on how liquid you are and what your current commitments and expenses are,btohqsg
Once you have RA after 55 you can top up directly to it. Don't need to go to MA,btohqsg
No hack. Only able to be done for UOB as that is stated on their site that they allow paynow sala  others need salary category from companies,btohqsg
Investment will have to be complete before can withdrawn. Its in their tncs from what i read. Just sharing here for everyone info,btohqsg
You should consider topping-up MA if your assessable income is above 40k since anything above 40k is taxed at least 7%.. below 40k at most 3.5% which is comparable to MA's 4.08% interest. Additionally will supercharge your SA once you hit BHS and hopefully by 55 you can hit FRS.,btohqsg
