Hi im planning to buy ipad from apple website but pay by monthly instalment thru my SC simply cash CC.Would like to ask if the monthly instalment will be considered as eligible spend and ill get the 1.5% cashback monthly? thanks!,btohqsg
To avoid 3% fees for amount above RMB 200  there are two ways that are stated here namely ChangiPay and OCBC App Scan and Pay  can I ask those who used before  which u think has typically better fx rate? 😊,btohqsg
Usually installment by cc wont qualify any rewards.,btohqsg
Any bro got trust debit card .I am a NTUC member by using trust debit card to pay see the point go in my account like not correct .any bro also using trust card?,btohqsg
need to link the trust card to ur fairprice app,btohqsg
U might want to consider OCBC NXT Mastercard if u ok to pay over 6 monthly installments. You can earn 1% cash rebate also,btohqsg
Hi guysFor hsbc ega account  supposing they will extend it next month  it is better to sign up on 1st August right? Based on the current rate this month (4.6%)for example - does it means that if I put 200k I will get - $766?,btohqsg
cannot be sure whether they will have new promo in Aug or what is the rates,btohqsg
But say it is the same rate like this month. My calculation is correct?And how long do I need to keep the funds inside ?,btohqsg
3.6% is for Jul and Aug only.+1% is on incremental balance compared to previous month  so only get for 1 month if keeping 200k throughout.,btohqsg
Ok so how much will it be say with this month rate ? 🙏🏻,btohqsg
This Miles vs Cashback Card Debate is getting out of handhttps://youtu.be/Th30LDoLplw,btohqsg
about $766 for one month as calculated,btohqsg
UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Card does it have a monthly cap limit to earn the miles ?,btohqsg
After that will earn 0 miles ?,btohqsg
Anybody here has got that table infographic showing which credit cards can miles-transfer to which airlines?,btohqsg
Imo it's very clear cut.Enough spend + willing to put in effort + want to enjoy business/first class = milesElse  CashbackEdge cases for short term that tips the scales towards miles team:1. Eligible for very good sign up promo and can meet criteria2. Huge one off spends that will significantly exceed Cashback monthly caps like wedding/home renovation3. Huge spends that usually don't qualify for card rewards/Cashback via cardup/payall etcOr people that like ad hoc trips and can make use of SQ spontaneous escapes to enjoy Economy class trips at decent value.,btohqsg

Hi! For DBS MID YEAR campaign  I got the $100.How come it doesn’t off set my cc bill?,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your help! I manage to do it already,btohqsg
It seems that the dbs 36x pts will end this july frm the yuu app?,btohqsg
Think if your statement is alr generated when $100 comes in then it will be offset in the next statement,btohqsg
Just now got issues logging in. Now ok le,btohqsg
Hi all  if I use Alipay (link to my UOB card) and scan Alipay QR at hawker. Will it count towards the UOB $500 min credit card spending? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
You try to scan first to see if Alipay allow you to scan.,btohqsg
Alipay only works for Chinese registered accounts. For us  we can’t use,btohqsg
For UOB one spending requirement  we can use to pay for insurance premiums but we don’t get cash back. I guess we can also buy NTUC vouchers provided we shop at NTUC frequently,btohqsg
But insurance is it for any insurance(eg bought from own agents) or only applicable to policies bought with UOB?,btohqsg
I use to pay for my prudential insurance policies. It is to meet the spending requirement and not for cash back or other reward purpose.,btohqsg
More than $150K which I didn’t withdraw anything.,btohqsg
Hi gurus. For standard chartered promo  does buying fairprice vouchers count to the min. spend?Read the T&Cs but still unsure. Thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg
I guess u have to research on your own. Crypto space is small. Not everyone into it.,btohqsg
Hihi can I jus ask a question? If I have a credit card  example Citi rewards + amaze  that can get me 4mpd  but I do not use it to redeem airline points. Is it even still worth more then 5% Cashback on their other redemptions?,btohqsg
UserErickhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:dont advertise such services,btohqsg
if this doesnt give you red flag  i dont know what will.,btohqsg
as it is potential malicious page  will remove all related chats,btohqsg
If on suspicious then just don't go.,btohqsg
Yes true. Maybe will become the next neko inu . Just greed for money bah,btohqsg
Anyway just my 2 cents. This is not financial advice.,btohqsg
did you mean you will redeem crmc pts as cashback instead? Someone did the maths and its about 2.27% cashback.,btohqsg
Possible but highly dependent on promo. The normal rate for reward redemptions (e.g. grocery vouchers  gift cards) are unlikely to give u > 1cpm  let alone the 1.25cpm required for 4mpd cards to match 5% cashback.For example  DBS rewards currently has a promotional redemption on Imperial Treasure $50 voucher for 1800 DBS points (which is worth 3600 miles). Assuming u value the voucher as it is (i.e.  $50)  u are essentially getting 1.39cpm  or equivalent of 5.56% on a 4mpd card.,btohqsg
