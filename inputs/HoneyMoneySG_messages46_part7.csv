Hello  i have been trying to apply for UOB EVOL  however  impossible to upload the documents online (error...)  Impossible to call them ...  Anyone's experienced the same issue ?,btohqsg
Trust bank (right)  gives better exchange rate than Amaze (left) ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Do u have Singpass Mobile (SPM) MyInfo? With SPM MyInfo  u might get instant approval from UOB.,btohqsg
I went through the same issue. Just drop an email to UOB CS. They will get the relevant department to assist you but the process will take quite awhile.,btohqsg
Yeah amaze rates are among the worst now because it allows u to earn your usual MasterCard rewards still + 1% amaze rebate.,btohqsg
I use Trust BankI am glad Trust Bank is the first that gives 0% foreign exchange fees. Low rewards then low rewards lor.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I thought so too. Until I went to compare with revolut and Wise,btohqsg
Any deals for signing up for Amaze?,btohqsg
And Youtrip. Trust is giving lower FX rate than these 3. But the highest among all credit cards,btohqsg
Its better than charging direct to credit card lol,btohqsg
This one nobody savvy will do one leh. Unless got fx rebate promo.,btohqsg
Anyone uses eWallet in Thailand as tourist?,btohqsg
Will look into that  thank you !,btohqsg
Sorry is there really a way to transfer USD from DBS Multiplier to Moomoo?  Seems only can find SGD transfer options in the app?,btohqsg
Then how u earn credit card rewards without amaze,btohqsg
Cannot Loh. For foreign. I always use amaze,btohqsg
try the website instead of app. same limitation with UOB.,btohqsg
They will email for missing documents,btohqsg
You can get the details from app,btohqsg
Sorry just to side track a little on the finance narrative  but is it cheaper to get Lux bags in Europe and declare for payment of GST at customs  or to get it in SG stores?,btohqsg
For savings accounts like UOB One and OCBC 360  the crediting of salary component  can it just be done as if youâ€™re transferring money from one account into that savings account? Or has to be an official credit by your employer,btohqsg
UOB One people in this group were able to transfer from DBS by selecting salary. If some day the bank wants to validate the credit received then they possibly take back the interest amount so just be careful  its fraud in a way.,btohqsg
interesting. i'd assume the banks know about this loophole but close one eye cus at the end of the day its about putting money into their banks,btohqsg
Hello  gurus. I have set up giro payment for my scb credit cards as it shown on the statement  I am wondering how long it takes to deduct from my HSBC account? The money is not deducted by my statement date starts from 16th May.,btohqsg
Agree in a way. As long as they donâ€™t take the interest credited back it should be fine,btohqsg
dont think they will take it back. they themselves updated their website to say they will accept it as salary crediting as long as you put the reference as salary. im thinking they just want to capture more market share thats all,btohqsg
Wow you got any link where it says to be acceptable?,btohqsg
its on their uob one page. you go see  there is a banner about halfway through the page that says they updated to accept this mode of crediting in december. so im quite sure they are aware that it would be used this way and allow it,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need to be scared. Worst case is they nerf it. As in donâ€™t recognise the fake salary credit anymore. They wonâ€™t ask u to pay back the interest already given.,btohqsg
good way to target self-employed tbh. if not the self-employed market segment totally cant use this,btohqsg
These are their T&Cs as of December 2022. FAST SALA is excluded. But because PayNow is a layer above FAST  and given how banks implement their checking  hay production happens.,btohqsg
And uob already knows for sure. Because many people already call into uob cso to ask them if they pay their own family members can or not.Just whether uob want to patch their criteria or not.,btohqsg
how u know many ppl called?,btohqsg
I in quite a lot of group chatsâ€¦..,btohqsg
this type of thing just do..  dont need to keep asking for official black and white one...,btohqsg
PAYNOW SALA seems the best option from other family member or friend account. FAST excluded.,btohqsg
I agree  no need to call CS. Many people in this group alr got interest credited.,btohqsg
alamak here la guys. they recently considered it eligible so im sure they are letting us do this,btohqsg
People have been doing FAST SALA. Point made was FAST SALA =/= PayNow SALA.,btohqsg
same same but different no? main thing is that whether its a loophole or not  and it seems that uob is allowing it to happen on purpose so just enjoy,btohqsg
Itâ€™s likely loose programming with unintended result.,btohqsg
does not matter so long reflected in tracker and get the interest,btohqsg
what matters more is people don't call banks to ask,btohqsg
could be intentional also  to target the group of people who are more conscious and will otherwise choose to put the money in other banks,btohqsg
not sure on the specifics of programming  even if it is they are embracing it by explicitly saying that its accepted,btohqsg
Then they might as well accept fast in like hsbc.,btohqsg
so that it will be a deliberate action,btohqsg
If it is salary. That is the main point.,btohqsg
many promos are like this. they don't just open to everyone automatically. they only open it to those who know and opted in. this is so that they will not end up spending money on people that doesn't care anyway.,btohqsg
