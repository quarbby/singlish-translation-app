It just doesn’t apply to Singapore if you think about it. My Econs tutor was talking about it too. Like in Singapore  we have a proper rubbish disposal system. Who tf throws their straws into the sea or canal? The only thing bad about using straws would be marginally depleting our natural resources or the health effects associated with combusting plastics in the incinerator. The whole notion that we should cut down on straw usage to save turtles is complete bs in the Singapore context,btohqsg
u breathe nus ntu air instantly become more clever isit,btohqsg
Yeah they did for a history seminar at hive for me before,btohqsg
They went in was like wow so cool take photo with us in the shot,btohqsg
it is just a reason for companies to cut cost  one straw 1 cent  if u magnify it u can save alot every year,btohqsg

Harvard even had to create a dedicate tourist area,btohqsg
Yeah I mean like a lot of companies are doing environmentally friendly practices under the pretence of being nice the environment so as to cater to consumers who are more environmentally conscious (esp the younger generation). But in fact they’re just doing it to save money LOL. Also look at how Apple keeps on talking about how they used recycled stuff for all their products coz they’re “going green” but they don’t mention the best way of saving the environment is to just not buy a new device unless really necessary.,btohqsg
Then maybe we can as students earn money as a side gig,btohqsg

Wait why do they do that tho,btohqsg
i was rushig for class at FASS,btohqsg
And as a history enthusiast I’m very disappointed the old NLB was torn down for SMU,btohqsg

Should’ve put smu in another place,btohqsg

As a history major it depends,btohqsg
