Plus is not ideal to implement that,btohqsg
the reason why we have a huge spike of new cases is due to the people returning back from overseas,btohqsg
and they would rather get treatment here in Singapore,btohqsg
basically just ban them from coming back,btohqsg
Even if implemented  the temp check will be a greater disruptuon imo,btohqsg
You can’t ban Singaporeans from returning to Singapore,btohqsg
do the 8pm to 8am for 18/hr,btohqsg
wah imagine temperature taking plus train fault,btohqsg
dont they have those kind of temp sensor machines,btohqsg
Essentially implementing temp check is like implementing daily train fault,btohqsg
that one some schools should have that,btohqsg
Esp if they need to drag ppl out with high daily temp,btohqsg
then come up with some bs rule like 'refusal to comply to temperature taking will result in deportation',btohqsg
Idk why such qns are asked when the notes/google have the literal answers,btohqsg
and also it wont make sense for the pharmaceutical industry to be a monopoly,btohqsg
no reassurance to be found here,btohqsg
i wrote monopoly am i getting 0,btohqsg
but i wrote productive and allocative inefficient,btohqsg
u get some marks for analysis,btohqsg
but i explained it in the “monopoly way”,btohqsg
till we see ur essay and ur qn,btohqsg
Econs is rly common sense one,btohqsg
2(a) is PD bc its transacted at diff prices at diff markets,btohqsg
i gave should & should not but explaining for monopoly,btohqsg
2(b) is prob because the pharmaceutical industry has patents etc,btohqsg
and if one company holds that right,btohqsg
i need talk about whether they’re productive & allocative efficient right,btohqsg
then they can price however high they want,btohqsg
i assumed only one company la,btohqsg
govt shd intervene bc drugs are a necessity to people suffering from certain diseases,btohqsg
take for instance drugs like insulin for diabetic patients,btohqsg
u cant have overpriced insulin for patients etc,btohqsg
then the opp ans would be,btohqsg
since pharmaceutical companies exist in an oligopoly,btohqsg
making prices naturally competitive and so if the govt were to intervene,btohqsg
i cant explain for u the theories etc bc its been yrs,btohqsg
the policies alr in place etc,btohqsg
what i did for micro qns is mainly demand supply,btohqsg
require less knowledge on ur own and if u can evaluate the situation on the spot,btohqsg
for this its rly the same ans,btohqsg
u cant have an overpriced healthcare system,btohqsg
then bring in policies alr in place by the govt to substantiate ur ans,btohqsg
i used underconsumption of goods with positive externalities and asymmetric information,btohqsg
i gave it in the context of heathcare too,btohqsg
then the second part just answered what they gave,btohqsg
the three policies and talk about its feasibility and effectiveness,btohqsg
i generally do not like market structure qns haha,btohqsg
a lot of seniors said that,btohqsg
Healthcare is a merit good  so there's information failure,btohqsg
asymmetric information it's for healthcare insurance bah...,btohqsg
@aesthctix2b) i explained it in the monopoly way sia am i dead,btohqsg
I literally did a qn similar to this for block test this morn HAHAHA,btohqsg
ya i used that as an example la,btohqsg
i think for As i did,btohqsg
i had my econs this morning too,btohqsg
@aesthctixhow to explain 2a can i just say price setter  diff in ped for consumers and unable to resell the goods,btohqsg
Like u make use of the preamble as an example,btohqsg
That's how you get more credit,btohqsg
but I think you're on the right track,btohqsg
its rly up to ur preference,btohqsg
for market structure thrs a few factors that u have to explain with the framework,btohqsg
u still holding onto ur SPX?,btohqsg
how far will the spx drop,btohqsg
it shot back up from its original huge deficit,btohqsg
but im nt putting money in yet,btohqsg
my portfolio is a mix of,btohqsg
but i think it rose too much today there was a circuit break,btohqsg
so actl today it went up abit,btohqsg
US Feds promised 'bottomless funding' for the market,btohqsg
but i feel its a sign of weakness,btohqsg
idk if i shld jump in,btohqsg
at least ur companies would shut down la,btohqsg
US potentially gonna spend $4 trillion,btohqsg
then after that theyll lower i/r like mad,btohqsg
at this point money rain from sky,btohqsg
Certainly  it's just really amusing that sex offenders can be rehabilitated but the same can't be said for people who can't be bothered to take their temperatures  when both have equally high chances of excelling,btohqsg
well  SG is alr in debt,btohqsg
the government predicted us to be on $18billion sgd profit this year  we are currently $10.9 billion sgd down,btohqsg
technically they predicted correctly by a bit  but forgot the minus sign in front,btohqsg
Temasek holdings is down $34 billion LOL,btohqsg
they cant predict a coronavirus coming,btohqsg
actl the whole world paying billions for this ba,btohqsg
to begin with this lost value is due to the fall in price of overvalued stocks,btohqsg
and to begin with  its hard to quantify a value to a stock,btohqsg
the money the govt is using,btohqsg
to fund the battle against corona,btohqsg
as well as the money theyre pumping into the economy,btohqsg
yes technically true  but if u look at it from another way also a bit grey,btohqsg
It hit the circuit breaker upward and stopped trading,btohqsg
at least its nt a circuit breaker downward,btohqsg
this is the 'voodoo magic Trump will pull',btohqsg
LOL it hit the circuit breaker again,btohqsg
why would there be an upwards circuit breaker,btohqsg
its actl the us govt buying,btohqsg
'a random walk down wall street',btohqsg
Guyss can I ask for tips for H2 math? A j2 here  I've done many practices and stuff but during tests and block tests  I tend to feel less clear headed and often make silly mistakes or can't do qns which I can do outside exam conditions. Esp my school papers  I always feel super shag and while doing  I always have the feeling that the math dept srsly knows how to choose the most tedious or most complicated questions  like I tried the supp exercises and stuff they're okay. But when it comes to the test  its a totally different ball game. And after a test  I sometimes feel demoralised but the results can be quite unexpected... Thanks!,btohqsg
"Not advertising  but I use ""Achevas TV"" online for H2 Maths",btohqsg
It helped me a lot eventually in doing well for A lvls,btohqsg
Maths is just knowing your formulas  concepts well and practising over and over again,btohqsg
i go blank everytime i do h2 math ppr,btohqsg
then work ur way up to harder pprs,btohqsg
also partially i damn lazy so i eventually dropped h2 math and went to focus on other subs,btohqsg
This rly helps a lot  not gonna lie.Even though its a tuition centre  the online service is free of charge. So essentially I milked it for the whole of j2,btohqsg
Why..... :(H2 maths is a literal free A,btohqsg
Say hi to game theory in NUS biz,btohqsg
Ya I tried the tys and they're actually do-able like dk a few marks here and there,btohqsg
h1 dont study can get A,btohqsg
But ya h2 maths rly free marks,btohqsg
Is easy to hit 54/60 if u understand it well,btohqsg
pure math is my weak part,btohqsg
Vectors my favourite pure math topic ngl,btohqsg
Reminds me of chemical energetics ( hess's law) thats why,btohqsg
b4 i dropped h2 math after complex numbers,btohqsg
i got whr i wanted yo go,btohqsg
also bc of some health reasons,btohqsg
later Credit Agricole ask u why u drop h2 math during job interview,btohqsg
i got hospitalised for a mth,btohqsg
meanwhile i got hospitalised during NS LOL,btohqsg
also got a bit of peer pressure la,btohqsg
my whole class 3 h2 1 h1,btohqsg
plus i decided id rather focus on,btohqsg
anyways spx hit circuit breaker again,btohqsg
ns is the best time to get hospitalised,btohqsg
fell back down to 2330 then surged back up in the next 10mins,btohqsg
oh my ns injury wasnt that bad,btohqsg

but considering i quite heavy so not bad la,btohqsg
my running also not that good,btohqsg
run 1.6km and walk/run the remaining 800m like 12min30s,btohqsg
mine no matter how hard i try,btohqsg

Better to give SAF the burden of caring for me than my parents,btohqsg
spreading rapidly and becoming harder to track,btohqsg
They say no more gatherings with >10 people,btohqsg
Lectures are split into smaller groups though  maybe 2 classes,btohqsg
impossible to reduce class sizes any further,btohqsg
We have fixed seating arrangement in the canteen noe lol,btohqsg
heck  they're barely able to doanysocial distancing,btohqsg
guys if entertainment venue close  how about movies and bowling alleys close akso isss it?,btohqsg
for some reason my cohort hasn't gotten allocations,btohqsg
Possibly in the future. Rn cinemas are making a LOT of empty space between seats. They are in sets of 2 and alternate,btohqsg
yee  i always buy ticket get free seats beside me HAHA,btohqsg
no  the news literally says they'll be shut down,btohqsg
"""The task force said in a statement that it will also close all entertainment venues such as night clubs  discos  karaoke outlets  cinemas and theatres where it said there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time.""",btohqsg
no more watching movies in cinemas,btohqsg
My friend went to a birthday party on sunday,btohqsg
And is planning on hosting one in april,btohqsg
at least im not jobless for now,btohqsg
until ..... ''all citizens to stay at home'',btohqsg
The closures are for a good reason,btohqsg
A lot of people will be jobless,btohqsg
But at least a lot of people will still be on this earth,btohqsg
Did you know we have deflation now 😎,btohqsg
i 1 to 1 tuition :(,btohqsg
https://tdy.sg/3bl226YAll Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended  in order to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools.,btohqsg
Should I send this to my boss,btohqsg

We should stay home to do our part as socially responsible adults,btohqsg
Hopefully they don't shut down gyms and swimming pools :(,btohqsg
Should probably dm the admin instead,btohqsg
i wanna earn 140 in 2 hrs,btohqsg
It's like 'hey admins can i post an ad  btw this is what the ad is about',btohqsg
defeats the purpose of asking for permission kek,btohqsg
Historically we never allowed any ads that 1) didn’t go through us and 2) aren’t for charitable causes,btohqsg
There may come a time when the admins become corrupt,btohqsg
idk why but i found that an interesting choice of word,btohqsg
Ever since John smith came into power,btohqsg
Life in telegram was peaceful and free of crime,btohqsg

I'm at tekong so 14 day SOL :(,btohqsg

what does the jap phrase in the white circle mean,btohqsg
Ik the bottom sentence means 2 reprints,btohqsg

but then again cannot spread misinfo,btohqsg
do you like fishes that much,btohqsg
in many ways  singaporeans are like magikarps,btohqsg
they try their best to train and evolve into gyarados,btohqsg
some succeed and become a cool dragon-like serpent  others don't,btohqsg
and those with money and connections can become mega gyarados,btohqsg

#CNA#AsiaIndonesia cancels national exams  affecting more than 8 million studentsMarch 24  2020 at 09:21PMIndonesia has cancelled the country's upcoming National Examination over concerns about the spread of coronavirus  a move that will affect more than eight million high school students  education minister Nadiem Makarim said on Tuesday.https://ift.tt/2wyaBwr,btohqsg
If cancel O and A levels how?,btohqsg
extrapolation from most recent internal exams  and an option to take the exams in a future sitting,btohqsg
i too like to fuck over the entire basis of Singapore's education system,btohqsg
We never know what's gonna happen in april,btohqsg
Or if there's even going to be a future left for us,btohqsg
they may just end up using predicted grades like in the uk,btohqsg
the MOE will never let schools shut down to that extent,btohqsg
if that happens then i guess we're truly fucked,btohqsg
MOE will keep making excuses until shit gets bad,btohqsg
All the private schools already shut down,btohqsg
MOE will wait till dorscon red,btohqsg
if school ppl got case  they'll go thr VJC path  implement more measures  then business as usual,btohqsg
and if schools got widespread community spread  then closing schools would be the least of our worries,btohqsg
to a certain extent  schools keep whatever's left of our economy chugging along,btohqsg
Who wants to gather next week,btohqsg
My fart travels more than 1m,btohqsg
NS can't be shut down even during DORSCON red,btohqsg
The whole point of NS is to be 24/7,btohqsg
Schools can close though  but when schools close I imagine there will be other measures that go along with it,btohqsg
for the number of cases per land density,btohqsg
probably won't affect their economy as much,btohqsg
they have the army marching around the country,btohqsg
if anyone goes out not for groceries or not certified to be able to go to work,btohqsg
it's a delicate balance between keeping everyone in and ensuring that the country continues running,btohqsg
on a personal level  yes drastic seems safer,btohqsg
on a macro level  drastic may not be the best way to go,btohqsg
so theres no more consultations and tuiyions,btohqsg
Well at least people can ask and answer questions here virtually,btohqsg
those who taking a’s or o’s or die die must promote,btohqsg
This is SGExams’ moment to shine,btohqsg
Anxious because the virus cancelled your tuition? Fret not! Join the SGExams Study Group today and get all your questions answered for free!,btohqsg
Almost every centre is going online,btohqsg
Should advertise this in the other groups like how they advertised in ours,btohqsg
advertise in the comments section under those tuition centre Reddit posts,btohqsg
Sigh I'm going back SG TMR from uk,btohqsg
and sent 3 messages for no reason,btohqsg
Is that the policeman at haw par villa,btohqsg
He’s now the SG United man,btohqsg
now that sounds like a singapore student,btohqsg
this would be more appropriate at the study groups,btohqsg
got a level group also leh,btohqsg
Too greedy liao. This guy is ex ACS & Raffles student.,btohqsg
what's the link between the first and second sentences,btohqsg
AC & Raffles ppl like to stereotype each other. This is an example to show that both can do better,btohqsg
based jotun utterly destroys 2 elitist institutions in 1 fell swoop,btohqsg
Hwa Chong breathes a sigh of relief,btohqsg
no  ISD just hasn't gotten to them for being communist sympathisers yet,btohqsg
Commies won’t be so blatant use company money to buy a house in a ski town,btohqsg
was my honestbee joke not funny,btohqsg
Should have gone with Dishonest Bee,btohqsg
At least you tried. A for effort.,btohqsg
i did have ac friends with elitist mindsets,btohqsg
maybe i havent met the elitist kinds,btohqsg
HAha waffles is elite mah! Waffles >> Pancakes,btohqsg
WAFFLES have right to be elite,btohqsg
but they seem to be like a diff level of elite that they dont know abt ppl below?,btohqsg
they tend to not realise that theres underprivileged ppl etc etc,btohqsg
hence they treat everyone like equals,btohqsg
its like telling aliens abt real life and they’re like ooo but isokay we’re all happy idk,btohqsg
HDB bakery waffles & Angmo waffles can fight. Both are elite to me,btohqsg
depends how insulated the students are,btohqsg
damn i never knew about the waffle socioeconomic gap,btohqsg
my friend told me once that,btohqsg
the teachers garnered everyone in a circle,btohqsg
and asked each student ti say their parents income,btohqsg
i think it’s more like hdb waffles  is pancake batter in a waffle shape,btohqsg
most of the kids were shocked there were parents earning less than few k a month,btohqsg
how many is a few k,btohqsg
so shld be less than 3k loh,btohqsg
i think it was to demonstrate smth i wldnt know,btohqsg
with rgs move to the campus it probably lowered,btohqsg
i cannot comment further because i am not a Student of Raffles Institution,btohqsg
one dude is money max and smth ceo son or wtv,btohqsg
I tell you my experience about elitist mindset at Raffles. Not all  but a decent chunk of them have this mentality.The elitism comes in 2 forms:1. The first kind are those that come from regular households. Only difference is that they’re smart (legit smart  like can teach the teacher smart de). They do well in studies and life because they’re smart (and some hard work  but mostly smart).So they see other ppl don’t do well and they think why don’t they just work hard? Or be smarter? They don’t realize how much winning the genetic lottery matters.You see a bunch of these types of elitists in top civil service.2. Second type of elitists are those born into already elite family  whether it is elite by wealth or status. From young  their social circle is almost entirely their type. They will do well in school because parents have resources for tuition  etc. they will also do well in life cos connections matter.For these elitists  they’re more ignorant of what other ppl go through. Like genuinely ignorant.So yeah it’s basically these two types of elites.Disclaimer: Obv not all Raffles students are like that. Some just run Dishonest Bee.,btohqsg
another one is mnc ceo’s son,btohqsg
thank you for your social class commentary sir,btohqsg
but not in a bad way imo,btohqsg
most of my friends were just,btohqsg
and their weekly allowance like less than 50 bucks per week,btohqsg
so they still be broke lmao,btohqsg
Yah. Like genuinely ignorant cos they really never were exposed to it.,btohqsg
also my fas friend didnt study at all until a’s yr 🤩 he do be clever tho,btohqsg
HOWEVER that wld be biased opinion of me,btohqsg
only one dude ik who aint too rich,btohqsg
i havent rlly met any other rafflesia living in hdb all,btohqsg
Yah. A lot of raffles kids are like this. They fail exams purely for lack of effort. Give them 2-3 months to work hard and they be knocking out the A’s easy,btohqsg
true leh  but I find hwa chong ppl more snobbish than raffles,btohqsg
hE LITERALLY CUT OFF MOST OF HIS FRIENDS AND PHONE WHEN HE CHIONGED IN Y6,btohqsg
Yah not surprising   HC basically draws on the same ppl of ppl as Raffles,btohqsg
i wont say a lot la  some also,btohqsg
based on ppl i know from raffles in my internship + raffles students im teaching now,btohqsg
there are raffles ppl who are unknowingly snobbish  but they actually arent  just that they don't realise they are,btohqsg
hwa chong ppl are straight up flexxors,btohqsg
just passed by a hc couple,btohqsg
but they holding hands in uni 🥴,btohqsg
got some degree of truth and falsehood,btohqsg
im more affected by the fact that good grades equals getting away with moral misdeeds,btohqsg
also some flex but they don’t exactly know,btohqsg
like they post on ig all,btohqsg
I like how all this suddenly serious conversation started cos I posted about Dishonest Bee guy,btohqsg
i guess elitism kind of needed in non elite schs to some extent,btohqsg
or else they will become more irrelevant,btohqsg
wow awesomei love to read things like this,btohqsg
Your ATTEMPT at a joke haha,btohqsg
Whenever i need a joke  i look at the mirror,btohqsg
"i dont get why singaporeans let people with good grades get away with rubbishe.g. my friend was dating this tinder guy and he treat her like shit but she keep saying ""but wah he from this elite sch in this elite course leh""",btohqsg
the raffles one above cfm more than 2 personalities,btohqsg
Honestly  isn’t this just your friend tolerating nonsense from that guy?,btohqsg
Haha. She’s setting herself up for big disappointment,btohqsg
ya but she wouldnt tolerate if he not from some good sch,btohqsg
Millennia Institute ppl also like to flex Dulwich,btohqsg
