need to apply giro or egiro bill payment for auto giro deduction,btohqsg
If there is anything I learnt from doing social media  one of the the most important one is: There is no point trying to win an internet argument. Just let it be,btohqsg
I agree. This is in fact my very point üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But here's the thing..I am ok to be wrong. Coz I want to learn. LolSo I was trying to see  have I missed a point that he's trying to make? Hence why I'm saying  I don't see anything wrong with arguing or discussing coz there should be an objective.If I'm wrong in my thinking  I'd love to learn why I'm wrong. So how do we do that? Discuss. Share your points etc.,btohqsg
Coz I only said that it was ironically sounding. Not implying any fact or reason that he can‚Äôt join a group without agreeing with the YouTuber or anything .,btohqsg
Ok  please end this squabble and Take it to private if you all still have grievancesLet get back to our lives and celebrate Mother's day.,btohqsg
Nah enough said liao  can‚Äôt really use sarcasm on the internet where some don‚Äôt understand haha,btohqsg
Yes. If you all want to settle. Can ask each other out for a fight. ü§£ü§£. Don't spam here liao.Disclaimer = This is not any advice. ü§£,btohqsg
Hi all gurus. Can i check for the webull new comers promo  can i do 5 subscription of the USD money market funds? Or basically any funds?//Deposit USD10 000 ‚Äì USD99 999  make 5 US buy trades  and maintain assets until 30/06/2024 23:59//,btohqsg
Buy trades apply to stocks/etfs for webull  unlike moomoo,btohqsg
@clowninwithsalmonlet's go out for dinner üòò,btohqsg
Mother‚Äôs Day best CC in my view Maybank fnf hitting jumbo this evening.,btohqsg
Hi all singlife saving give 3%p.a. for first 10k cash with no term and conditions.I just found out it give additional 0.5% interests for first 10k when u top up $800 per month.Is it correct?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any idea how come I use cimb world master card to pay for Agoda hotel booking to pay now in sgd however cimb charge additional 10% on my booking price?,btohqsg
Check if the payment processor is overseas,btohqsg
Seems like it.. the description shows HK,btohqsg
Charge under what transaction description or the 10% merged together with the hotel booking??,btohqsg
Then it might be because of that. I have been charged this before by uob too on Airbnb for example. So I use trust card now  no issues of extra charge,btohqsg
The actual payment made was 413.69 but i went in cimb credit card account see it was charged $417.83,btohqsg
Really first time kena this kind of hidden charges.. last time use hsbc and Amex don‚Äôt have such issue,btohqsg
1 percent not 10 percent lah. It is call dcc fee,btohqsg
From CIMB website - Fees for foreign currency and cross-border transactionsA fee of 1% is levied by Mastercard or Visa for all transactions:i) made in foreign currencies and/orii) made in Singapore dollars but processed outside Singapore.An administrative fee of 2% is levied by CIMB Bank Berhad for transactions in foreign currencies.,btohqsg
Where got 10%? 1% only  right? That is DCC charges.,btohqsg
Often happen with agoda and airbnb who have payment gateway overseas,btohqsg
Yup  got done once. Never again üòÅ,btohqsg
Not that bad lah if got bank specific discount the 1 percent is nothing,btohqsg
I used shopback the rebate should be more than 1%.. hehehe,btohqsg
Of course  if got discount  then it's all good. Airbnb usually has nothing,btohqsg
Dbs running 15 percent discount with cap now and uob 7 percent without cap haha  both better then agoda 5.5 cashback hehe,btohqsg
Ahh I use cimb to hit new cardholder spend criteria,btohqsg
There‚Äôs promotion on shopback for cimb cardholder too additional 10% cashback,btohqsg
The concept is the same as dcc  u pay overseas in sgd also incur 1 percent  coz it is process overseas,btohqsg
Haha ok. I use dbs wwmc just book agoda so i get discount plus 4mpd. To me is more attractive,btohqsg
0.5% apply on fresh fund or entire balance?Do we need to maintain fund balance?,btohqsg
Hi all  what‚Äôs the next best alternative card if you‚Äôre ineligible for the UOB Visa Infinite? Thanks.,btohqsg
If UOB ecosystem then UOB PRVI  for general spending. Most would think you should apply UOB PPV or UOB VS for 4mpd.,btohqsg
CRMC and Kris+ can award 2.25 reward?,btohqsg
hey guys  i invested into T bills recently  got the refund back recently  any quick and ez formula for calculating the raw returns?,btohqsg
Actually local cards.. are not doing well compared to citi rewards and hsbc revolution  due to 5 blocks system.  Exceptional is only UOB ladys card.,btohqsg
Understand. yes the 5 dollar blocks might be issue for people.,btohqsg
I will be following the admin of this group cancelling the uob Plantinum visa soon,btohqsg
Nice to see you back Anh,btohqsg
Thanks...over the last 2 years.. become more mature... do more research before asking here,btohqsg
You go youtube .. search . Why he stop using the uob Platinum visa card,btohqsg
Did Heymax really put you into a special group with you alone and no one else. That was the last I heard of you.,btohqsg
Not really... when I can't find answer. I go find answer in milelion or hey max.,btohqsg
Comparing chris vs aaron. I would prefer Chris in the way he select credit cards.,btohqsg
Maybe chris spending habit is more similar to yours,btohqsg
If you have the UOB one or Lady to clock the monthly $500 spending  the PPV is good for dining or day to day contactless shopping with less hassle. Like go IMM  I just pay with PPV applepay,btohqsg
Since my UOB lady category is family and travel.,btohqsg
