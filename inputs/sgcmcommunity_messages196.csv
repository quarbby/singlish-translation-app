U know ah car computers that save your G force  save your top speed etc.I remembered driving a 911 with those features. God luck if police decides to fine for speedyou if they toggle that screen and found out no evidence of this car leaving Singapore. 😏,btohqsg
I think City Car Driving is a pretty decent game which mimics city traffic to a good extent & they have a driving test mode which is pretty good (tough). Euro Truck Sim is also very nice game  mostly driving European roads  more fun when you have right pc setup. Some mods include SG  MY  ID roads simulations.,btohqsg

if it costs as much as a taycan,btohqsg
will cost lesser than taycan  but will be close,btohqsg
Full electric can produce in Sg right?,btohqsg
Thts e plant in Jurong for,btohqsg

HMGICS currently produce regular Ioniq 5 EV only. even Ioniq 6 not produced in singapore yet. doubt Ioniq 5 N can be produced here or anytime in the near future,btohqsg
too many performance EVs you can buy for about the same price,btohqsg

Just cough up the amt in cash. Bigger car is easier fr road trips,btohqsg
Just buy whichever car you like better and within your budget,btohqsg
I also looked at these. Nice cars. I disagree with the guy below. Fc of hybrid is better. Battery you can replace if needed  but the battery quite reliable on those models I think.,btohqsg
Some dealer already changed battery. Haha so you think worth to buy?,btohqsg
Nice car and I hear Lexus reliable. Just be aware of high roadtax. Insurance probably higher too.,btohqsg
Can't say for sure as I haven't driven one. Every car unique.,btohqsg
But 63k for an Audi A3 is cheap tho,btohqsg
Try to bring it down to 61k lo. Then depress one year 12.2k nia,btohqsg
No choice leh now market like this I also suck thumb,btohqsg

Hi would like to get advice from anyone here. If a car have only left less than 2year or 1.5yr COE (depreciation only 13k+)do u think it is worth to buy this kind of short coe lease car to drive for a short term also to monitor the coe trend then when coe going to end then plan for renew or scrap.,btohqsg
Newbie here  need more advice from everyone,btohqsg
26k can do a lot of things,btohqsg
25k put 3mths FD also earn,btohqsg
Depends on the model? Sedan?13k seems quite ok. Can request to do a workshop check prior purchasing. 1.5yrs means u can keep trying new car,btohqsg
Yah save 2 rounds can put deposit for new car le,btohqsg
If I salesman I will tell u Don’t ask how much. Ask how much youth u left with,btohqsg
Still too long. Buy 1 left with less than 6 mths,btohqsg
The shorter coe left the better. Assuming mkt depre or less,btohqsg
The shorter the coe  the more u will utilise ur car . So actually the money u paid is more worth it,btohqsg

I'm looking at 2nd hand Nissan X-trail  7 seater. I need a car as I have new born twins  need to send them to infant care school everyday. Have also survey few 7 seater model like Toyota sienta & BMW 216i gran tourer  but both model have almost equal and more depreciation than Nissan X-trail. The downside for Nissan X-trail is have less coe left and smaller 3rd row seat.,btohqsg
How in the world does it goUp to 100 bucks for one trip,btohqsg
I charge u $70 plus buy u kopi n bf,btohqsg
U can eat in the car nvm,btohqsg
I can drive 2 trips lesser,btohqsg
ImGenuinely curious how one trip goUp 100 bucks,btohqsg
Yes. Coz just grab i wont be able to get car at my area,btohqsg
Consignment unit  do take note on the car condition and nitpick on it  usually can shave off some of the cost.,btohqsg
Can wait very very long no car during peak hours...,btohqsg
Dont get continental if price is a big factor in your car decision making.,btohqsg
Guys  put it in this situation  if u have new borns like me  and always need to send them to infant care  and so always need to go hospital clinic for appointment.. Do u think it is worth to own this parf car (7 seater) for 1yr 6month then in the end scrap? And then hopefully nxt 2 Yr coe trend become lower and find again next 7 seater parf car.,btohqsg
Considered the Outlander? Also 7 seater. Sat in it once and looks surprisingly spacious,btohqsg
Ya.. That's why now target on this Nissan x-trail  as Japanese car more safe to maintain,btohqsg
Owning one is always more expensive than taking grab / taxi  but it will be more convenient.  You can try to own for 1-2 years and see how it impacted your finance  lease also possible for these period.,btohqsg
But mitsubishi outlander is 2.4cc  worry on the fuel consumption. And so far I don't see any low mileage outlander.,btohqsg
Can buy 28 days later? So dealer pay the road tax 4 u,btohqsg
Actually xtrail 6th n 7th seat is very small,btohqsg
Disadvantage of taxi or grab is always need setup baby car seat and take time to call taxi/grab. Especially calling taxi/grab at KK hospital sometimes really make me n my wife crazy.,btohqsg
Condition seems good if mileage is true,btohqsg
Ya 7 seat suv r like that. Even x5 n q7 same,btohqsg
Book grab premium 6. Even if driver is at Tuas  he will magically appear in ur location in 5 mins,btohqsg
Then go for it  just take note on the cost.,btohqsg
Diesel abit more requirement to take care la. Im driving a petrol mpv. So far so good,btohqsg
U will feel heavenly if u pump diesel in jb,btohqsg
Trying to find lowest depreciation parf car with 7 seater. So far many mpv only Toyota sienta is the lowest but cat A and I had drive fews time Getgo Toyota sienta  actually plastic feel and less premium if compare with Nissan X-trail,btohqsg
Not dare to try Diesel mpv like Renault grand scenic or citroen. I'm not familiar with diesel car,btohqsg
Sienta is the cheapest mpv in market. No choice. If u can find citroen petrol can consider. But depre also very high now also,btohqsg
Im on petrol citroen. I find renault have 1 of the most posh interior among mpv. Even better than noah,btohqsg
My fren used rgs to do phv for 1 year 100k km np,btohqsg
Conti mpv always better interior/exterior than jap or kr,btohqsg
Main problem with rgs is the aircon. And if wanna buy 2nd hand rgs abit hard to find non phv,btohqsg
Nowdays any bread and butter car also got phv use,btohqsg
Even sienta also got many phv,btohqsg
Thats y lo... but the main few culprit r the same old. Diesel car  Freed sienta  toyota sedans and some korea cars,btohqsg
But if u go see either rgs or cit then u wont consider xtrail liao... at least ur wife wont,btohqsg
Eh ya must consult the wife,btohqsg
Especially if she got chip in also 🤣,btohqsg
The phv pax see the glass roof will like WOW like some sua gu,btohqsg
The glass roof for rgs really wow sia... the interior very atas also especially the door closing sound. I wanted to get touran initially... but after my wife see cit.. touran kanna banish liao. Too old according to my wife,btohqsg
Actually Nissan x-trail have glass roof too,btohqsg
I think you more or less sold on xtrail already. Can go down for viewing / test drive,btohqsg
In fact I had viewed & test drive with other dealer.. Jz need more opinion from experience ppl like u all.. As this is my 1st time buy car  scare to make wrong decision,btohqsg

Many Features loaded as compared to some features are optional in its brother brands..Good drive. Spacious with its big boot. Auto tailgate function is available too. Matrix headlights.Pickup is helped with mild hybrid technology as well. Overall quite satisfied except the after sales svc have to improve more. My MU died 3 mths into the new car. That's just my bad luck I guess. But overall the car gives me a premium feel,btohqsg
