Normally actual festive day is quiet on the roads. Eve is when every1 party,btohqsg
Serious ah something I don’t know,btohqsg
That’s why I pangkang liao. HAHAHAH! 😅,btohqsg
Last time see high price roughly can stack will cheong,btohqsg
Singpost centre can park outside n walk in to collect food?,btohqsg
But whether you will tio Saman that I can't guarantee 🙈,btohqsg
Make it quick. No more than 10 mins. That’s the grace base I keep to.,btohqsg
No confidence. Park cp manage to exit within 10min,btohqsg
Actually sometimes u will b surprised that can make it,btohqsg
Provided don’t need to fight for carpark.,btohqsg
Once I parked at handicapped lot and chop-chop pick up. Heng heng nothing. 😅,btohqsg
Heng still got few lots left at b2. Faster run take lift to lvl 1 take food n go bk to car n exit cp,btohqsg
Park at B2 still can exit within 10 mins. You must know where the shop is huh?,btohqsg
1st time go that shop. Heng heng saw it n quickly run over.,btohqsg
Can park paya lebar square also if need time. There got free parking on weekend and PH. But Singpost usually I just go B1 CP. There always got lot,btohqsg
I wonder how oddles earn a profit during holiday. All the fare so high and I see their receipts sometime it’s free delivery,btohqsg
Actually if U guys realise all base fare for credit order is no longer $9. It's $8.50 cause in once order accepted it will auto deduct $0.50 to lalamove as platform fee.,btohqsg
On top of the 16% service charge fee lalamove deduct from the total delivery fee..,btohqsg
Ya sia. All pooling cheap and far,btohqsg
Do not support this stupid polling order unless it's the right price,btohqsg
Today is a very bad day. Not much order,btohqsg
The fare so low who wanna take for today,btohqsg
It's not tdy bad day. It's normal day. Is last few days/wk is festive period so have many jobs with good price. 😂,btohqsg
Haha past 2 days high fare  today normal fare wan to do also shag,btohqsg
Wrong. Don’t support pooling order at all. It will backfire to you. Unless you wanna experience it on your own. By all means.,btohqsg
Wahhhh? Again no drive today? 🤭,btohqsg
Price too low for him 😂,btohqsg
Cheong too much during this 2 wks  now fall sick liao,btohqsg
"Me: ""SAYS UNIT NUMBER""Guard: ""For what?""",btohqsg

HAHAHAH! Dinner will be busy unless a lot of drivers on the road. 😅,btohqsg
finally witness a good customer. I reached The pick up address and it’s closed but she didn’t know. She still pay me the full fee and cancel for me lol,btohqsg
After Xmas will quiet until b4 cny,btohqsg
Looks like a bit busy now. Around town,btohqsg
All the way until after new years day,btohqsg

If it’s along the way  I will still do it. 🤷🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
You night shift every time is it? 🤭,btohqsg
Yeah... I'm vampire boi  only come out at  night to deliver 🦇,btohqsg
After doing llm I think they ald set 1 hour give u earn $20 only no matter how u chooseCorrect me if I am wrong,btohqsg
