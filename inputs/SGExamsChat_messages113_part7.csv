That special thing is passion/values/other experiences that youâ€™ve had that relates to the course,btohqsg
I think if you really want it  they can sense it during the interview,btohqsg
The poly just want good reasons why you wonâ€™t give up while studying and why youâ€™ll do great and just generally be a valuable addition to the course,btohqsg
Prior experience and interest and talent are part of that,btohqsg
