Any good alternatives to hsbc? Citi/amaze?,btohqsg
Time for new miles card recommendation video?,btohqsg
Yeah  and from 1 Jan DBS WWMC for airline tickets online transactions.,btohqsg
Hi All  applied HSBC revolution CC on SingSaver previously.  Got received gift  any min holding period before cancel this card?,btohqsg
Heard UOB CC nid hold at least 9months? Otherwise bank come back to u to claim back any gift?,btohqsg
HSBC Might as well just discontinue revolution cc,btohqsg
No harm holding the Revo card as it has no AF. For now. ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Can always cancel then aim ntb in 1 year time loh lol,btohqsg
actually all along i'm amazed how u all use HSBC Revolution as to me it is a lousier CRMC,btohqsg
and it doesn't have miles pooling (in the past) as well as no miles purchase facility...so it is very very hard to accumulate a worthwhile amount to redeem air tickets?,btohqsg
It has its uses before  like buying air tix that crmc can't buy. After all these nerfs  not any more.,btohqsg
yup i hear you.. it is more like a side kick to the main cards that you have maxed out.. since to buy air tickets  you would typically use UOB Lady with travel category for 6mpd,btohqsg
I like multiple player with the good card haha,btohqsg
Different spending habit of cos. It was quite ok for food last 2 years wasnâ€™t it.,btohqsg
4mpd for food is so so only?uob lady is 6mpd for food.maybank FNF is 8% for 5812Citi cashback is 6% for 5812 5814,btohqsg
What is considered non-contactless these days lolâ€¦,btohqsg
Uob lady got it after they open to men. Other cards I do use as well. Why?,btohqsg
Will uob preferred platinum visa be a good replacement for hsbc? (Since mainly using apple paywave?),btohqsg
Yes but be careful of UOB merchants,btohqsg
