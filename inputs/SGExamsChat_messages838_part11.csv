It is my own privacy too,btohqsg
Do you know Bang Shi Hyuk is creating a new label too?,btohqsg
It is call Honesty Entertainment too.,btohqsg
if i was a new member of sge tele  i would have guessed that you're in your thirties/forties,btohqsg
our version of ACES workout aka that mass workout schools would force us to do together,btohqsg
aces day  wonder if it still exists,btohqsg
i hated aces day from p3 onwards,btohqsg
probably does in primary  i hardly see it anywhere out of primary schools,btohqsg
everyone can literally recognize these songs,btohqsg
"mainly ""witch doctor""  ""kung-fu fighting""  ""stop  drop & roll""",btohqsg
my school dosen't even have aces day,btohqsg
Hello  is there anyone who is the student at NUS,btohqsg
my time was called the Great Singapore Workout,btohqsg
i didn't know that actual concepts for these workouts existed in the first place until i read up on some CNA/StraitsTimes article ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
ok but i do not use it,btohqsg
are you asking if anyone has tried wingstop or if they're tired of it,btohqsg
i tried wingstop before but the portions too big for me,btohqsg
maybe im ordering the more expensive sets,btohqsg
their portions just ok for me,btohqsg
idk but the taste just isnt it,btohqsg
it's so strong to the point i just feel like i'm getting a mouthful of salt,btohqsg
the flavours are too strong to be honest,btohqsg
i would prefer something with more flavour instead of savoury,btohqsg
YES Thank you.. finally someone who shares the sentimentðŸ¥²,btohqsg
like  i can deal with saltiness but wingstop is on a different level which i can never eat on a frequent basis,btohqsg
i know right.. i tried so hard to get into it because everybody made it seem like the holy grail of chicken,btohqsg
wah but i tried like 12 times and just couldnt,btohqsg
not sure what you think of 4 fingers chicken. I think too sweet,btohqsg
I tried it long ago very saucy,btohqsg
I think i had the dry rubs one for wingstop? Was ok ig,btohqsg
sorry but i would rather eat this spiciest meal in SG ( Chongqing Mala ) over Wingstop,btohqsg
unsurprising for a place started in texas,btohqsg
i don't like a lot of flavoured chicken these days in the Fast Food biz  instead I still prefer the old traditional ones like Original (Non-spicy) & Spicy,btohqsg
like even with McDonalds  KFC & Burger King,btohqsg
never really liked the variations like Argus Burger series,btohqsg
McDonald removed the beef burger with egg ðŸ™„,btohqsg
i tried Wendy's back in the Philippines and it wasn't as bad as what people say about Wendy's food is horrible apart from the marketing/publicity department on their social media platforms,btohqsg
just to let you know  this was back in 2018 i think?,btohqsg
ive only had wendyâ€™s once back when it was in sg,btohqsg
so that was even longer ago,btohqsg
how was the taste ( of Wendy's ) that you  last remember,btohqsg
itâ€™s just typical fast food taste,btohqsg
we need raising canes in sg,btohqsg
wendy at century square closed down,btohqsg
i didn't say i had wedny's in sg,btohqsg
i wasn't even born when wendy's first came to st& exited quietly and out of sg,btohqsg
i meant i had it overseas,btohqsg
i mean i didn't have Wendy's when they were in Singapore for operations,btohqsg
it closed in 2013 or 2014 i think,btohqsg
i know  im just saying no one around me that i know on a closer level had tried or even myself had (meaning to try) a taste kf Wendy's when they operated for business in Singapore 2x ( aka TWICE  not the kpop gg*girl group) before they closed down respectively in the 1980s & 2010s  specifically 2015 during their second failed turnover when they came back in 2009,btohqsg
