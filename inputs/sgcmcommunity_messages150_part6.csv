hi fellow drivers  as a new driver   i am thinking if i should buy the old cash card since there are flashpay  one motoring card  EZ-Link for contactless paymenta. Are there still carparks in singapore that do not accept contactless card for payment ? Just don't want to get stuck when exiting a carpark.,btohqsg
the new nets motoring card shud be fine,btohqsg
Hi  can check what‚Äôs th diff between vcashcard and nets auto top-up?,btohqsg
Flashpay cashcard should work even for those carparks that don't have the erp thingy,btohqsg
I haven't encountered the issue of the card not working even in those super old carparks,btohqsg
but i hope its phased out alr,btohqsg
so i can still insert using the flashpay card ? cool ! thanks !,btohqsg
You different  you're like a gremlin  cannot touch technology will fail,btohqsg
Some machines can insert la bro,btohqsg
And if cannot pay just press the button and complain,btohqsg
so i still need to buy the old cash card just in case :(,btohqsg
so to be safe  get 1 x old cash card and 1 x one motoring card?,btohqsg
