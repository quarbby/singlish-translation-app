hi Bosco  care to share with us what have been going on for you? so that we can see how to help you or at least share with you how we deal with our caregiving issues too?,btohqsg
was it due to dementia? or mental health related?,btohqsg
i understand  i used to face the same situation with my mother previously until we seek help officially for it to mediate,btohqsg
are you getting support from any organization or peer support group?,btohqsg
can i bring this conversation to you privately? so that i can give you some advice and referral to get some advice? but pls feel free to ask any other caregiver related questions here  i'm sure the rest will be able to support you along the way - you're not alone,btohqsg
Stay strong! If there is anything I can help  please do let me know. We as caregivers need support from time to time always,btohqsg
Stay strong  I have been a caregiver to someone in the household with mental health issues too. There are times I feel the same  just want to leave everything...What worked for me was talking to someone with no judgements of my negativity  I'm thankful for that pillar of support. I started journaling too  it helped me to acknowledge my feelings  accept them and then reframe it into something more positive. Also I firmly believe that the person with mental health didn't mean to hurt us  they are also trying to cope in ways that maybe we can't understand. But as long as they are trying  I felt that I should try too.Hope that by sharing how I cope  can encourage you too ❤️,btohqsg
Hi dont give up  u are not alone! U need to take care of yourself before u can care for others. Listen to peace ful music. And be mindful!,btohqsg
Hello everyone  my name is Elcia and together with my classmate Josephine we are Year 4 students from the Singapore Institute of Technology currently studying Physiotherapy.

Hi Jane  thank you so much for supporting our study. We have approached SNSA to get their approval to disseminate our study but have yet to approach ABLE.
