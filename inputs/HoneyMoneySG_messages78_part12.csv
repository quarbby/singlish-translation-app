Hi all  I have 2 questions  hope someone can help out 🙏 Let's say there r 2 scenarios:1.If let's say Nov I spent $1000  and I already received my UOB account interest. This month (Dec) $400 from the previous month's purchase was refunded to me.Do I need to spend $500 or $900 for this month? Given that taken into account after the refund  $600 was still spent in Nov (> $500 condition met)2.Heng:If let's say Nov I spent $600  and I already received my UOB account interest. This month Dec $200 from the previous month's purchase was refunded to me.In this case is it I need to spend $700 for this month? Given that taken into account after the refund  $400 was effectively spent in Nov (< $500 spent),btohqsg
Isn't that interest is calculated on daily basis? So if you have 107k on one day  only the first 100k gets 5%  and the 7k will get only the base interest? Hence  the total interest for whole month will not be the same when there are some days with 0 balance?,btohqsg
It seems to be reflected as others category when I check on the treat SG maybank app,btohqsg
Monthly day average so if withdraw out on 30 dec u need to top up on other day to cover the shortfall for the dec 2 day,btohqsg
bonus interest is based on Monthly Average Balance,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. Guessed I confused it with DBS.,btohqsg
I will draw out on 30th Dec  Saturday 8am.,btohqsg
29 days if withdraw on 30 Dec,btohqsg
ok i think after the discussion above  i decided to be consistent with my kiasu and kiasi ness and make it $112k now... and then move out on 29th December morning instead  leaving just $10.,btohqsg
Do note that uob only allow 100k of transfer out per day normally. So need to put extra elsewhere,btohqsg
"""Elsewhere"" meaning in UOB but out of UOB ONE?",btohqsg
yes good tip. One way to bypass UOB $100k daily limit is to have joint accounts.So the other joint human opens up another $100k of transfer limit,btohqsg
I think I understand this better now.Even if I submitted Participation Form on 1 Oct  if I ensure my daily balance from 1 Nov to 31 Dec is above (100K + 30 Sep balance)  I still qualify for this promo and should expect earmark by 31 Dec?,btohqsg
if you had submitted on 1st Oct and put in $100k on 1st Oct and don't touch the money  your earmark would happen by 30th November.,btohqsg
The earmark always happens about 20 days AFTER the month you put the money (and don't touch at all),btohqsg
"I understand  but I did ""touch"" the money. The question is more forward-looking - am I still eligible for this promotion if from 1 Nov to 31 Dec  I maintain above $100k + 30 Sep balance?",btohqsg
Anyone realise that spot rate for SGD to MYR is about 2.8% difference,btohqsg
Google: 1 SGD to 3.5 MYRAmaze: 1 SGD to 3.4 MYR,btohqsg
this one don't think anyone can confirm to you.. maybe even CSOs will give you different answer.What you COULD try is:1. submit the form again now2. topup your account with $100k + 30th Sep balance NOW  and do not touch it3. expect earmark by 31st January.,btohqsg
And I should EMPTY the account for a day first? Cuz now it has $104K.,btohqsg
haha your account situation is a mess now  sorry to say.The problem is nobody knows what UOB has classified your account asMAYBE you should take Mousehunter advice and sit this one out.Empty your account on 29th December.. and hope for Chinese New Year promo (hopefully comparison date is 30th or 31st December) and do it 100% correctly,btohqsg
you also dunno what is your 30th sep day end balance right? (did i get that right),btohqsg
Haha yes a mess indeed. Ok - gun for next promo then :).,btohqsg
Is the Sep bank monthly statement reliable?,btohqsg
Compared to Mastercard rate of 3.4638  abt 1.9% difference.,btohqsg
Wow  maybe I’ll use trust then. Thanks,btohqsg
yes i guess if the statement last line shows CLOSING BALANCE is $xxx.xx,btohqsg
Hi  Is it correct to use as below to max out rebates on Harvey norman purchase?1. Pay $400 using DBS Live CC via Paywave2. Pay $400 using DBS Live CC via Kris+3. Pay $2000 using DBS WMC via Kris+,btohqsg
"Hi  when i charge an amount to my CC  it normally shows "" pending"" in my cc account.The eligible transaction date is based on the date when i charge the amount  or the date when the transaction is completed?",btohqsg
This mean the requirement is fulfilled based on the date i made the online purchase?,btohqsg
My transaction is posted in the uob system  but it is still under pending. May take 2 weeks to confirm.,btohqsg
I might miss the eligibility period after 2 weeks,btohqsg
Anyone knows if convert from DBS to Krisflyer or AirAsia points better?,btohqsg
no  if posted then there will be a posted date and no more pending,btohqsg
May be 2 weeks cos apple delivery for my product is in 2 weeks time.,btohqsg

Hi friends  citi premier miles can get 1.2mpd for SimplyGo concession pass?,btohqsg
Sadge :( but thanks  looks like only can get 0.4 mpd using hsbc revo,btohqsg
Thank u. This is something new. Last time cannot increase above $100k.,btohqsg
Say you register on 1 Oct If you want UOB to earmark in Nov  top up by early 31 Oct or better on 30 Oct and ensure the required amount is maintained in Nov until the fund is earmarked.If you want UOB to earmark in Dec  top up by early 30 Nov or better 29 Nov and ensure the required amount is maintained in Dec until the fund is earmarked.If you want UOB to earmark in Jan  top up by early 30 Dec or better 29 Dec and ensure the required amount is maintained in Jan until the fund is earmarked.Be sure to check estatement from bank on what is the actual end of month balance. For 30 Sept  you need to include the base interest (same as what is on the estatement)  for 31 Oct amount  you need to exclude the base interest for calculation.,btohqsg
Hi  sorry for the stupid qn coz first time participating. if i have 100k earmarked in the christmas promo already  then can i still empty my account on 29/30 Dec to zero my end of month balance in anticipation of the cny promo (if any)? Thank you!,btohqsg
Ah ok  so am I right to understand that I cannot qualify for the cny promo (if any) and will have to wait for the subsequent one after my earmark for the christmas promo has ended?,btohqsg
correct.Although 'in theory' you COULD register for a second earmark promo while the first earmark promo hasn't ended  it won't make sense  since the UOB One account only pays good interest up to $100k.If you had already earmarked $100k say for Christmas  and you hard force another $100k earmark for Chinese New Year  you would theoretically be having $200k in the UOB One account  with only $100k earning bonus interest and $100k earning base interest  albeit you do get 2 x earmark cash rewards. It is still not worth it.P.S. someone did mention there is a clause about you can only be involved in one promo at a time  but seriously  don't explore it la.. it doesn't make sense  since the 5% p.a. Bonus Interest is still the priority. The Earmark Cash Reward is just the Sweetener.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is Trust SGD to MYR rate?,btohqsg
Hi  am looking to apply for this DBS altitude card. To be eligible for the welcome bonus miles  need to clock $2000 in 30 days from approval. Any idea if payment for lasik treatment will count towards it? Noted that payment to hospitals is considered as an exclusion. However  am doing lasik with a private outpatient specialist clinic.,btohqsg
should be eligible assuming not mcc 8062,btohqsg
