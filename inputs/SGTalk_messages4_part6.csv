GST for UK is 20%   Aus is 10%,btohqsg
But I think those who voted for Jamus & WP are ok with minimum wage.  Which is good too.  We need to help the lower income people.  We can pay $8 for meepok to help the cleaners.  We can also pay $3 for a hotdog bun in Breadtalk to help the bakers and salespersons.,btohqsg
We should also increase the conservancy tax  maintenance tax and town council fees by at least $50 per month.  We need to have minimum wage to help the minority like cleaners and refuse collectors.  We need to help the poor ya.,btohqsg
Thats why I said many singaporeans dont know we are high tax because we have many hidden tax that people did not include. Someone did the sums and found that we are about the same as other high tax countries,btohqsg
"Not only things with the word ""tax"" is tax  many other fees and charges with other names that you pay to the gov have to be considered as tax",btohqsg
Anyways our meepok price  is going to increase  laksa too and breads and chicken rice,btohqsg
I dont agree it is all about increasing tax  which is the standard solution from pap  they simply refuse to consider other solutions,btohqsg
voting for oppies or PAP  tax still have to increase because they both agree,btohqsg
Most SK areas already more than $50,btohqsg
What fuck u mean yishun.. guess you should be kick out frm this group,btohqsg
Ya lor.  Vote for anyone. GST still have to increase what,btohqsg
Any increase in the next 5 years is coming from pap since they are the gov,btohqsg
You so smart  please share where money going to come from?,btohqsg
Not going to answer this kind of question which is an attack,btohqsg
Lol. Everything blame govt. Ask you for solution you say dont share.,btohqsg
Let me share a harsh fact with you. No matter pap or wp in power or any party in power. If you cannot make it  its because of you and you only. No govt is going to change that. No policy is going to change that.,btohqsg
No matter which country you are in  which govt is in charge  its on yourself if your life is miserable.,btohqsg
Coming from Codriver also.  Codriver cheering driver.  I am your lite  your lite  your lite. I do light work and u kenna the blame and I earn $16K per month to be your lite 🤣,btohqsg
Oh yea. Laksa with cockles $8.  Ok la. Every month I earn $16k to be your lite 🎉,btohqsg
Remember what WP saidEverything they don’t oppose  they supportIn 2011  MP pay is $10k per month  WP proposed to increase to $16K per month 💪,btohqsg

most food sellers are not on minimum wages. I am an owner of F&B. meepok won't need to go $8 coz we paying more than minimum wages proposed already.cleaner yes  higher wage means higher cleaning pricing  around 5% more  as most of the costs of cleaning is beyond labour ba,btohqsg

So nice if it can happen in Sgp also,btohqsg
