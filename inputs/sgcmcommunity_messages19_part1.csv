Blue is a very interesting colour actually,btohqsg
Is it matt wrap or gloss blue type?,btohqsg
Very deep meanings behind it as well,btohqsg
Tesla also  wack to keep battery pack hot,btohqsg
i made the engine better. unfortunately the timing belt broke a few months later because it is very sensitive to mileage interval where the ex owner did not keep a record when it's replaced. but the replacement of the belts and valves is so cheap you would not believe it. e30 parts. cheap.,btohqsg

So BMWs are reasonably priced when it comes to maintenance? Different from hearsay?,btohqsg
no no. that is valid only for old models like pre 1995 models,btohqsg
"where only one motronic is used.since 2000 when bmws becomes ""sophisticated"" with many sensors  things changed. they become more expensive to maintain.",btohqsg
like the e92  expensive to maintain,btohqsg

maintainance is cheap for most conti. expensive is the repair,btohqsg
Performance motors so big and long serving also can‚Äôt üõë another competitor in this market,btohqsg

Eurokars has been dealing with BMW for a long time as the ADs for Rolls Royce and mini,btohqsg
We will find out soon enoughüòâ,btohqsg
The key differences will probably be specs on units with different combinations and options specced or left unticked  structuring of package with free service packages or higher overtrades/discounts and the availability of stock,btohqsg
Must be right? If they can‚Äôt show they can take some volume‚Ä¶.. BMW also can‚Äôt justify their decision to do this‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Anyway from memory I dun tbink 2 official dealers hve ever happened here right?,btohqsg
my bet is eurkars will do better,btohqsg
So silly‚Ä¶. Go to showroom A and call SR B‚Ä¶. How ah? They offer this and that‚Ä¶..u can make it cheaper? Anyway lah:)),btohqsg
Consumers will rejoice unless the dealers collude and fix their margins up,btohqsg
the differences won't be too much after a while  only when they start of Eurokars will push a lot to get sales up because sales=service customers,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt avoid not talking about mazda,btohqsg
is Mazda the fave car brand here?üòÇ,btohqsg
general consensus seems to be that,btohqsg
