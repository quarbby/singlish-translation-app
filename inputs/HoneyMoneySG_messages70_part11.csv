Is this not addition? Correct me if i m wrong..,btohqsg
Added for the 100K only. But you put 200K inside. So your EIR is 3.525% for 200K. Must well put 100K in OCBC and another 100K in CIMB.,btohqsg
amount above 200k  yes gets 0.05%. I'm actually talking about exactly 200k. Then the rest outside of 200k (exactly) will be deploy to money funds.,btohqsg
what does this means then? Maintain an average daily balance of at least $200k - Grow (2.4% EIR),btohqsg
Maintain 200K  then your first 100K get 2.4% more interest.,btohqsg
Oic  looks like i been misunderstanding it totally lol.. thank you all for the sharing session,btohqsg
You can use the interest calculator below that to experiment your numbers.,btohqsg
icic  damn.. finally i learnt something about ocbc lol,btohqsg
Not OCBC fault  you just need to be extra careful,btohqsg
If u put 100k  every month u get 390. If 200k  u get 600,btohqsg
Meaning the the additional 100k will earn u 200 more per mth..,btohqsg
If u hv 100k extra  suggest to put other place like RHB FD which will give u 3.6% Per Annum with 3600  equivalent to 300 per mth which is more then the 200 per mth for the 2nd 100k u put with OCBC,btohqsg
addtional 100k should just put in UOB,btohqsg
Yeah.. UOB One also can for the 2nd 100k.. but must meet UOB One criteria to get 400 per mth,btohqsg
uob can stack with xmas savings promo,btohqsg
For cash management account liquidity is key  for immediate deployment into stock markets. Cannot compare with savings accounts and FDs  by the time funds are transferred out  might lose window of opportunity,btohqsg

Any idea abt estimated yield for T bill?,btohqsg
These days one year yield lower than 6 mth,btohqsg
To lock in for one year  I don't mind 3.8,btohqsg
Why not put RHB FD at 3.6%?,btohqsg
