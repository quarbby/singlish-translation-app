I came across an abandoned workshop sometime ago,btohqsg
yeah just like hospital patients wtf,btohqsg
and i get fucked for saying that,btohqsg
Ya but the condition is like u probably need to get like 3 or 4 cars to chop and patch to get one road legal working example,btohqsg
Ofc la but the ones I sell are completely fine,btohqsg
A friend of mine last time had 520i E39,btohqsg
His engine had issues so he went JB go swap the 2.8 i6 from the 528i E39,btohqsg
I have no fucking idea how that car passed inspection every year,btohqsg
Probably because it's the same engine except longer stroke and bigger bore,btohqsg
i sat in that wrx b4. tried to drive it as well. failed.,btohqsg
guys is this legal in sg,btohqsg
This is the country where if ur car don't come with LED headlights  u cannot upgrade to LED headlights,btohqsg
what if it comes with lasers,btohqsg
All cars SKU need to be homologated with LTA before they can be imported in for road registration,btohqsg
say to lta it is stock,btohqsg
I'll bring it to a meet one day,btohqsg
and flash it straight at the entrance,btohqsg
damn that livery was beautifully done bro,btohqsg
If it comes stock then LTA LLST lo,btohqsg
One guy his GT3 RS went for inspection fail,btohqsg
Because they see rollcage they think it's illegal aftermarket mod,btohqsg
They had to fly one German dude from Porsche down to SG to bang table YOUR BRAIN CELL IS NEIN IT COMES STOCK WITH ROLLCAGE,btohqsg
Yes it was.Once upon a time  she was beautiful,btohqsg
I do not know if the car is still with that workshop  like I said the last time I saw it was in 2020,btohqsg
My brother passed on not too long ago  so I don't really want to go back to that workshop to see if it is still there because reasons,btohqsg
My condolences man  I'm sorry to hear that,btohqsg
sorry for your loss bro üôèüôè,btohqsg
Rest in peace to ur bro,btohqsg
The workshop also had this Supra as well,btohqsg
it's sad seeing cars like this,btohqsg
there's some classics at carros that are also catching dust,btohqsg
Some may just be squatting waiting for parts to homologate and register as classic plate,btohqsg
Classic plate everything must be stock except for radio  tire and rim,btohqsg
One guy I heard wanted to bring in aDe Tomaso Pantera,btohqsg
But the car has one common issue that can be easily fixed with a minor aftermarket mod. LTA say cannot. So he decided not to bring in,btohqsg
Anyway we will see a few GTR R32 with new classic plates soon,btohqsg
All coming out of the woodworks now since the 1st batch of R32 was launched in Aug 1989,btohqsg
R34 will need another 10 more years  by which time the Americans would have cleaned out Japan by then because Paul Walker lol,btohqsg
is there going to be a new years dempsey?,btohqsg
Dom's car can survive a Fat Man + Little Boy nuclear bomb blast because nothing is stronger than family,btohqsg
Can gimme the exhaust pipe üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Car on right should be a VW,btohqsg
"My friends: ""how many times have you replaced ur DSG mechatronics?""Me: ""Yes""",btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt they sold to south africa iirc?,btohqsg
The swift blew its engine so written off because not worth it to replace engine when on 5 year coe. The other 2 I dunno what happened to them but I don't think they got exported,btohqsg
Out of the 4 cars (me and my 3 friends) mine is the only one still running around because I managed to renew at a sane CAT A PQP in Sept 2020 before it went to hell,btohqsg
Because I bought it brand new in 2010 under the old CAT A system (which didnt have the stupid 130hp limit)  I renewed under CAT A,btohqsg
whta happens to cars after their coe expires,btohqsg
Sometimes there are....ways for them to come back as track aka non-road-registered cars like my brother's S15,btohqsg
Usually those that get exported are those higher value cars in running condition like BMW  Mercedes etc,btohqsg
