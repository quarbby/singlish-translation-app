I’m also surprised they didn’t let u learn from the erhu,btohqsg
They should hv just upgraded someone from the erhu that hv experience lmao,btohqsg
But how is it like under the nose of the conductor,btohqsg
I was picked on in secondary school lol,btohqsg
Then my senior said it is coz dsa = higher expectations,btohqsg
wait that reminds me of this one person i had in primary school,btohqsg
we had such a shortage of gao hu and zhong hu,btohqsg

Then she scolded the flute sl coz there were no extra scores for me atm,btohqsg
yeah but poor girl was made to play all 3 styles,btohqsg
while i was there just holding my sticks waiting for my turn to hit some strings lmao,btohqsg
My conductor is a erhu player,btohqsg
I really actually hope co dun die here,btohqsg
my primary school conductor worked with him before,btohqsg
I think smu is the sco conductor,btohqsg
Ntu is the same conductor as Tjc,btohqsg
Wait Moses conduct sec sch ah,btohqsg
Tj is the grey hair guy idk his name,btohqsg
He was a bit too scary for someone to deal with in primsru school,btohqsg
Got one time we made him so mad he just walked out of practice,btohqsg

after being in music and drama,btohqsg
dad jokes are a sign of aging iestin,btohqsg
Cant deny that im old af now,btohqsg
Im mentally like 50 with the body of a 75 year old,btohqsg
Except with the self discipline of a 9 year old child,btohqsg
TATA box-TATAAAA sequence  located 25bp upstream from the transcription start site-Serves as a binding site for a general transcription factor (TFIID)-Facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase-Determines which of the two strands of the DNA helix is used as the template strand-Not Transcribed,btohqsg
how did you take 2 h1 subjs,btohqsg
I remembered my pri sch conductor make ppl stand on chair for various reason,btohqsg
sounds like your conductor was an insulator,btohqsg
the majority just looks like physics at this rate,btohqsg
makes me think that chem is closer to physics than bio,btohqsg
it is. Maths gave rise to Physics  which gave rise to Chem  which gave rise to Bio,btohqsg
You referring to the bad conductor part?,btohqsg
thank god i took h2 phys and not h2 bio then  since i took triple pure science in upper sec,btohqsg
sounds like physics is more useful,btohqsg
i actually love biology more (interest wise) but my bio knowledge is only limited to sec 4 pure science lol,btohqsg
ngl when ppl ask me for my hobbies right,btohqsg
idk if its weird to tell them i like reading about animals,btohqsg
No wonder my bio cmi cause of chem,btohqsg
If I took BCME it's gonna be suicide,btohqsg
yesbcme probably only useful if u very sure and confident to study bio related stuff in uni,btohqsg
s4 physics knowledge sufficient for me to fix up lights and change non led to led lights at home,btohqsg
Man idk is it just me but somehow bio doesn't click w me,btohqsg
Like imo of all the 3 sci like at sec level  bio was the one that has the most terminology,btohqsg
