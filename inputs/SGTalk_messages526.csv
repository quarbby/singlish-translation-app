@LeoInBaththat's considered a bang last night,btohqsg
Well my head got banged for sure. Unfortunately that was the full extent of it.,btohqsg
Gosh. I don't want to imagine it,btohqsg
OK la  no hangover  woke up bright eyed and bushy tailed.,btohqsg
Though the number of times I've woken up in 2024 and now first day of 2025 fully clothed in bed from a drinking night out is getting a bit... disconcerting.,btohqsg
First day and u r well preserved. Hahaha,btohqsg
Like a woolly mammoth found perfectly frozen in the ice.,btohqsg
Fossils are worth a lot of money.,btohqsg
So thanks for saying that I am very valuable. Hahaha.,btohqsg
Actually coal is also a type of fossil. But people burn it so...,btohqsg
Without which... well  you think for yourself what kind of world that would be.,btohqsg
Yup. And UK has a ton of it.,btohqsg
"Which they can no longer burn because ""environmentally friendly""... never mind the fact that China and India are happily burning coal still and growing their economy off the backs of that energy security and self sufficiency.",btohqsg
But that's a rant for another time lol.,btohqsg
More than in SG definitely I'd say.,btohqsg
But I am very aware that at the end of the day to them there  I will always look like an outsider.,btohqsg
To be fair  no other nation is shifting over to renewable faster than china.India on the other hand needs the cheap energy source.,btohqsg
It's ok la. Some Ang Mo are legit nice and treat you as per norm.,btohqsg
Agree on China  though it's not out of some tree-hugging sensibility but because they don't want to be held hostage by the US blockading their oil imports from the Middle East by sea when they go to war in future.,btohqsg
Partly tree hugging also la. Else their bejing air will be like infinite psi. They also planting the great green wall of china around the Gobi dessert for a decades plus liao,btohqsg
But have a hole Ang Mo too. I encountered some racist arse before.,btohqsg
Also in winter  alot of UK folks don't shower one. Or was it just my unique encounter?,btohqsg
Beijing air pollution won't be resolved from simply moving away from burning coal  not when you look at how many cars there are driving around in the capital city of the world's second-most populous country and they don't have annual VICOM inspections to make sure car engines aren't spewing out soot from their exhaust pipes.And yeah... great green wall of China around the Gobi... whereby they have to keep them alive by piping water to irrigate them in a country that's increasingly facing water insecurity and shortage today let alone in future. Lol.,btohqsg
IDK eh  though it is true that in winter it's a lot easier to maintain personal hygiene because you don't sweat.,btohqsg
So less to no stink at all.,btohqsg
Hahaha some sgporeans don‚Äôt bathe too if u realise.,btohqsg
"Actually racist AMDKs don't ""hurt"" as much as ignorant ones do. Actual racists are a small small minority. But racists get to exist because of the multitudes of ignorant NPCs around them in society who do not correct or educate themselves or the racists to be more worldly  tolerant  and knowledgeable beings.",btohqsg
For me personally dealing with ignorant Westerners was far worse than racists  which I'm glad to say has been a negligible issue for me.,btohqsg
That's y their cars all going EV ma. Then they build all the nuclear power stations and solar + wind farm. Not forgetting their 3 gorges dam that actually affected Earth rate of rotation.Regarding the tree planting  I think got to cut the Chinese some slack. Terra forming is not an easy task. Take a while to learn thru trial and error.,btohqsg
That's not true. We sweat even when temperature is zero outside. Fact. But sweat less yes.,btohqsg
Simply becoz they don‚Äôt like to bathe.,btohqsg
Really ah. Lai tell me your ignorant Ang Mo encounter.,btohqsg
EV is hardly clean. You're just outsourcing the pollution somewhere else. Cobalt and rare earths mining is incredibly toxic and polluting. What China does have going for it is how it is starting from a relatively clean slate in terms of urban planning which allows them to actually put in power grids for their urban cities that can handle large EV populations and distribute electricity efficiently and effectively. Most other cities in the world cannot do this because there's already too much legacy infrastructure in place that basically makes ripping up old power grids or building new ones incredibly expensive.,btohqsg
Alot got to do with their upbringing and their education. Not everyone is fortunate to even get basic education. So we sgporeans are really blessed.,btohqsg
Think about it  these people thoughts processes are interesting‚Ä¶i really think humans are complex,btohqsg
"1) Go into nightclub  the DJ see me walk in immediately queue next song to be Gangnam Style. Because of fucking course all yellow-skinned East Asians look like they're from goddamn South Korea.2) Last time at uni I studied a humanities degree. This was mid-2010s btw. Imagine having Western/angmoh coursemates and even one particular professor in my case who was from East Germany ask you ""where is Singapore  is it part of China?"". Don't even know where Malaysia is  don't even know about Malaya and Straits Settlements colonialism under the British Empire apart from India and Hong Kong  ask me ""so let me get this straight  you're Chinese by race but not Chinese by nationality  you're from Singapore  your first language is English  you also know how to speak Mandarin  how the hell does that work?""I jitao just told them ""the same way that I don't assume you're from America simply because you're white and only speak English.""",btohqsg
The Gangnam Style story I don't even know if I should feel offended or flattered by the racism lmao.,btohqsg
Actually they did some studies considering from production to end of life  for an EV  it is still greener than an ICE  even if the EV uses electricity from a coal plant.Agreed on the ease of infrastructure planning in china vs USA or even UK. But still got to give them credit for pushing ahead with all the high voltage DC transmission line and such. It could have been worst if not for their foresight.,btohqsg
Like  yay I guess that I'm seen to be good looking enough by angmohs to pass off as an oppa?,btohqsg
Not bad to be mistaken to be Korean. Haha must be good looking!,btohqsg
Most political systems and government outside of China cannot match Chinese foresight  simply because their leaders don't stick around long enough.,btohqsg
Or hmm u know single lid‚Ä¶ugly?,btohqsg
More like pale looking +  wear stereotypical Korean drama glasses.,btohqsg
Does help to be tall too.,btohqsg
Haha i ever been asked  u r asian but ur english sound Jamaican. Hahaha haiz lol,btohqsg
Oh yeah btw if anybody in this GC here feels that all this discussion and talk here isn't SG-related and I/we're going off topic for this group  do please tell me and I'll stop lol.,btohqsg
Ah. Lol. I get it.But i mean it is also not easy for us to name countries in Africa. So for them who never or rarely travel out to Asia  I can understand their ignorance or being perplexed. I mean Europe or US is so big  you can hardly travel to every corner of the continent.,btohqsg
*goes to look in the mirror* why you so bad lol,btohqsg
It's the 21st century  if you can have time to go on social media and look at cat videos and brainrot memes then you have the time to IDK use the Internet to educate yourself.,btohqsg

Singaporeans are one of the best essay writers in the world.,btohqsg
