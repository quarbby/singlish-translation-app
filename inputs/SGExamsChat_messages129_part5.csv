Whats so hard about doing a paper,btohqsg
okay did u get your 90rp?,btohqsg
i remember someone having difficulties going uni ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Even without that I don't think u can get 90rp,btohqsg
Can I ask does anyone have any tips on how to study for Hist? Especially for UN haha,btohqsg
Best is to remember case studies that are chameleons,btohqsg
Meaning  case studies that are applicable to different kinds of question,btohqsg
That will ensure you will have some examples to run a few basic arguments for any question,btohqsg
After you mastered that  then pick out those special case studies that illustrate special cases  that often also mean that they're only useful for one kind of question  so not much strategic returns  but if that particular question comes out you have an ammo for that A,btohqsg
i see you using tele for ns,btohqsg
I did easily get into uni tho,btohqsg
oh right its your head jwjdjwjfn,btohqsg

Thanks for pushing my low self esteem even lower,btohqsg
Then again this economy is big sad if you entering it now,btohqsg

But the starting pay a bit the crap,btohqsg
Ye well as in  if gov sector pays 5k,btohqsg
And this one only offer 3.2,btohqsg

but in this current economy  i think we should be glad if someone extends a job offer to us,btohqsg
Yeah hence I'll take it but I will also go apply elsewhere,btohqsg
If I get then i'll drop,btohqsg

Just instantiate them as py objs and add attribs as necessary ez/s,btohqsg
Aha ya i ask the perms,btohqsg

Well it's gonna be low pay no life grind and i'm not sure if i'll enjoy managing ppl in the future so given a choice i'll apply elsewhere,btohqsg
