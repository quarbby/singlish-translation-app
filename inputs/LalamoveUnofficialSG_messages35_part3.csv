Lol hero I kanna so many times before,btohqsg
How u handle such cases?For that particular oneI canceled and left the sofa lobbyHaha,btohqsg
I usually tell customer to upgrade or I just take pictures send to support. Best is before you load you tell the customer that 1.7 van cannot pick up the load and ask them if they are ok to upgrade.,btohqsg
Yah failed to do thatThey disappeared after load up and refuse to pick my both my calls and cs,btohqsg
The customer will paiseh say ok ðŸ‘Œ,btohqsg
But they offered to help me,btohqsg
Usually I got help so I always like to ask the sender if the item one person can carry or not. Itâ€™s a good way to get them to add helper,btohqsg
Waa pick up 1:15 at senoko. Ask me rush to bishan and reach by 1:30. Thought i fly sia,btohqsg

"I notice some of my cancelled orders say ""driver cancelled""  even though customer is the one who call to cancelDont know if it will affect my record when they implement smart matching ðŸ¤”",btohqsg
Actually customer end cannot change the vehicle type right after the order is placed.Yesterday I tried to help a customer to change but can't find on the app,btohqsg
Not sure abt new interface  but usually they can do it in appBefore you swipe pick up,btohqsg
I tried very hard to find eh.. bo,btohqsg
Actually just ask the customer to top up in cash to you  you use user app to check price,btohqsg
Then act blur dont deduct 16% comms hee,btohqsg
Everyone is doing this way ðŸ˜†,btohqsg

Tips: how to catch these smokers  always have a weighing scale ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
luggage scale + tape measure. must have.,btohqsg
Based on experience  tape measure pretty useless. Cause according to lala  if it fits  and is within weight limit  no extra charge,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve delivered many items that were over the dimensions limit (but still within weight limit) and never gotten upgrade before.,btohqsg
Always been taken advantage by cheapos,btohqsg
means u call up cs ?,btohqsg
I just  see today i purely car orders no tips,btohqsg
