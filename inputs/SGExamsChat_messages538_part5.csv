US is actually okay. It's just that the media often blow it out of proportion. For example the idea that most Americans don't know geography. That's mostly satire but many people take it seriously lolIf look at MSM  china has their fair share of fked up moments that reach the headlines sometimes  especially their tourists but we often don't bat an eye to that,btohqsg
been to us on a few occasions. If you go to Chicago and New York  yeah I understand what you mean but elsewhere  many Americans are actually genuinely nice people and welcoming to tourists. Often times comparable to australians,btohqsg
