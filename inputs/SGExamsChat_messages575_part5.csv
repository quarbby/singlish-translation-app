i heard for jc need profile.. so i need to build my profile before jc / uni right ? like thru activities / volunteering jobs,btohqsg
If it's the interview needed courses,btohqsg
Also unless u talking abt like,btohqsg
Nah but fr this was what really shaped my perspective abt IP students. cuz even though I was from an IP sch  I got like bullied q abit for not being rich/having the money/having the time to go out with my IP friends. I think only the JAE students unironically understood what i was going through.GENERALLY  IP students tend to be more towards the upper elite la so thats why i can understand why they dont have the empathy. But it was a very big disconnect lor cuz people would do this all the time (CHS MOMENT!!!),btohqsg
heard that uni see student profile and students w more experience get in first ???,btohqsg
UNI they consider what u have done holistically,btohqsg
like from sec sch to uni ?,btohqsg
But if ur RP is shit dont bother trying,btohqsg
iirc its past 5 years from year of application,btohqsg
cuz for me i talked abt all the shit i did from2018-2022,btohqsg
Its the type of people who believe that u can get everything even if u dont work hard,btohqsg
