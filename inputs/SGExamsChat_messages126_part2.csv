Hi super random here but the Chinese oral topic today is about River Pollution!The video showed a family like in a park with a river and the kid trying to place his paper boat on the river but the mum stop him + the dad picking up garbage!,btohqsg
Is there a crocodile in the park,btohqsg
My first question was If I saw someone doing the same thing as the boy  what would I have done?The second was how do I encourage those around me to avoid polluting the riversThirdly was is the government doing enough to reduce the pollution in rivers,btohqsg

Anyway but essentially yeah I didn't expect river to come out LOL I tried to talk about ÁéØ‰øù in my second question but got shot down by the examiner,btohqsg
