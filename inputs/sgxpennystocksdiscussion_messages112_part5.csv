Scenario:- My stock market gains (realised + unrealised) was at $1m as of end Aug but recently went down to only $600k.your unrealized dropped 400k. But also mean u already realized few hundred k in profits- I am holding a portfolio of $600k stocks.Your realized/ unrealized is 600k but your portfolio is 600k. Meaning u looking at least 100% or multibagger returns since u got 600k profits and portfolio is 600k.Regardless of proportion of your 600k in realized and unrealized  u are outperforming the market and prob 95% of members here.- some pennies stocks are down 50%Seems peanuts compared to the % returns u have in portfolioShould I sell all to cash out?Or hang on and wait for recovery?Own choice no comments. Some already showing dissent for selling after heeding boss Ong calls and market rallied.,btohqsg
