Have you ever come across a $10 000 scooter? Well  meet the 946  Vespaâ€™s newest and most expensive model. With swooping lines and a big red leather-textured seat  it neatly epitomizes the Italian brandâ€™s gradual transformation from maker of inexpensive transportation for the masses to purveyor of two-wheeled fashion accessories.A ride around Manhattan last week proved the 946 to be a capable  comfortable and rather convenient way to get around the city  though the prospect of leaving an easy-to-steal item with a list price of $9 946 parked on the street might scare away all but the most financially robust. But that seems to be the point; only those who can afford a scooter that costs nearly as much as some entry-level cars will be riding these.,btohqsg
