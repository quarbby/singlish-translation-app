Yea hanoi and hcm pretty ok liao  except for like those smaller eateries. Probably to avoid fees and tax,btohqsg
When you select fairprice  did you select the app version on Heymax? App version is considered online.,btohqsg
It's ok  next suggestion without proper explanation will be another long term mute.,btohqsg
Nope. Not that I know of. It was all purchases on Taobao app (I even checked the mcc code) and shopee.,btohqsg
Supposed you checked all calendar transactions for Taobao and Shopee through DBS Digibot?I would assume you have spent at least $800 and just purely on Taobao and Shopee?If you spent only $800 on all transactions above (and had verified MCC with DBS Digibot)  you should get $48 in cashback.If you spent the cap of $877.2  you'll get about $52.63 in cashback.,btohqsg
Yup I did Yes spent at least $800Indeed :(,btohqsg
You checked by transaction date and not posted date right? If there's anything off you might want to check with the CSO.,btohqsg
Yes. I checked by transaction date. Just to confirm  the cashback posted just 2/3 days ago is for June right. Yup I‚Äôll call them!,btohqsg
Thank you Sam  appreciate it  will looking into this üôèüôè,btohqsg
Most shopping mall can use amaze and restaurants also,btohqsg
Can use your amex platinum charge?,btohqsg
It depends whether the merchants accepts. My advise is to use amaze with citi rewards for oversea usage,btohqsg
is uob one debit or dbs visa better for daily usage for nsf  monthly spendings around 500-800 / for savings as well,btohqsg
Does Citi prestige still come with   Jetquay?,btohqsg
uob one debit for bonus interest on uob one account,btohqsg
I applied for a credit card through the SingSaver website. According to the promotion  if I spend a minimum of $500 within a month  I will receive a free gift. Additionally  Citi Rewards offers 40 000 welcome points if I spend more than $800 within 2 months.If I meet both spending requirements  will I qualify for both the SingSaver free gift and the 40 000 welcome points from Citi Rewards  or is it possible to receive only one of the rewards?,btohqsg
Yes 1 rewards and singsaver one in this case.,btohqsg
Good sunday everyone  I want to start slowly accumulating dividend payouts but I'm a complete noob to investing  could anyone point me in the right direction on how to start? I've done some research online but it just make me more confused on what I should do and where I should begin üò¢,btohqsg
Hi  anyone did the HSBC invest 8% for a mnth? Can check when and how the topup to 8% was credited?,btohqsg
I know that companies are the ones who payout the dividends  but I don't really understand what exactly I need to invest in to receive the dividends.. and also  some places say to invest in stocks / reits / ETFS etc. But if I look at my ibanking there's other things like blue chip  some kind of bonds thing and stuff.. how do I know what it is I need to read up more about to get started?,btohqsg
Bros. I think I will retain the revolution card as it is annual fee  not charged,btohqsg
I believe we follow closely to chris post on YouTube. We won't go wrong.,btohqsg
Thank you for giving us your insights,btohqsg
I will retain revolution too as i am paying for classpass and gym membership monthly  only card that i see provides 4miles per dollar for such payments  passive 1k+ miles per month,btohqsg
Yes agree. Fully utilise air ticket spend before Dec 24 end. Then will switch for Air spending to dbs woman card,btohqsg
How much miles/$ would I get if I buy lg tv via krisshop and pay with uob krisflyer?,btohqsg
3mpd on the card+ what mpd offered on kris+,btohqsg
Count towards the $800 to spend in uob krisflyer to enjoy no cap on 3 miles/dollar?,btohqsg
Which gym and how much are you paying for? Looking to sign up for a membership as well,btohqsg
Recommend is anytime fitness 24 hrs. 88$ monthly,btohqsg
Not a lot near my area but thanks,btohqsg
Anyone knows if paying for customs import tax to dhl can earn rewards ?,btohqsg
I am charging my insurance to uob evol to clock out the $500 spend for uob one account only so never clock the $800 Cashback. Don't have that much spend for the categories also,btohqsg
Will recommend to change to uob one instead,btohqsg
Google drive still ok for HSBC Revo still get Cashback?,btohqsg
Abit difficult now $800 need clock $200 from overseas fx spend right?,btohqsg
800 is uob evol  uob one only requires 500. Im talking about the card in case u were mistaken for the acc,btohqsg
just less rebate if no fx spend,btohqsg
Oh icic sorry saw wrongly. Thanks for info I go take a look on uob one first,btohqsg
Bros .. now I told the banks to put my credit limit to be same as bonus cap rate for citi rewards  uob lady; dbs woman card..,btohqsg
Shld be 2x your bonus cap rate‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Funny  because all these bank card is shared limit among other same bank card. So u dont need to use other card within same bank. Citi reward then dont need citi premier liao loh.Another funny move without thinking through the implication,btohqsg
Different function.Citi premier miles is mostly for book agoda hotel. 6 miles earn.Citi rewards is usually for attach amaze with same function as uob preferred visa. Is a direct replacement to it.,btohqsg
U really dont understand what i am saying do u?,btohqsg
You say share among other bank cards for the limit....,btohqsg
You set your Citi credit limit to 1k  it‚Äôs shared amongst all your Citi cards. Quite a stupid move if you did that,btohqsg
Bro admin. I would like to check with you others say amex platinum charge card no credit limit. High spend usage. But they send me letter say only at 7k. Pls advise,btohqsg
If u request 1k for citibank  mean u only got 1k for citireward and premier together. So u tell me what happen when u need to use both in the same statement,btohqsg
Stop trying to act smart and then do the stupid thing,btohqsg
Means your NOA below 120k so there‚Äôs a hard limit. If you want can submit NOA to proof income above 120K   then no hard limit just soft limit,btohqsg
