They technically have no obligation to reply u,btohqsg
There is a right way to do it,btohqsg

recruiters (extwrnal) are sales ppl  they also hope u get it.,btohqsg
So hey guys I‚Äôm trying to buy a new laptop for poly in AprilMy budget is $1800The laptop must have i7 processor and 16gb of ram,btohqsg
normally when will the school IT roadshow be ah,btohqsg
I got 1 iPad + 3 laptop and I wanna get a PC now,btohqsg
Those two laptop can handle games? Like Val or Minecraft?,btohqsg
I play league Dota  r6  valo csgo on those,btohqsg
Is an ipad enough for jc?,btohqsg
My laptop broke lol. I sent it for repair and it broke again with the same problme,btohqsg
I see a lot of students using iPad Air and iPad.,btohqsg
I mean seems a little difficult to multitask with it,btohqsg
Yup. Especially Pri / sec schools,btohqsg
Meanwhile my jc uses laptops that take 30 mins to start,btohqsg
No i mean if i used ipad as my primary device for sch  a bit hard to have multiple tabs open in one page,btohqsg
But then again never use b4 so idk,btohqsg
no like ur laptop broke right,btohqsg
Can be done. Side by side window,btohqsg
Oh it couldnt connect to the internet cus driver/hardware prob  i sent it for repair since i have warranty,btohqsg
cannot connect to internet is the problem?,btohqsg
It was repaired and i lost internet connection 2 weeks later again,btohqsg
was it unable to find the internet,btohqsg
Is it the wifi card issue?,btohqsg
or like did it say connected but no wifi?,btohqsg
There wasnt even a wifi option,btohqsg
the wifi option wont turn on?,btohqsg
That happens to mine as well.,btohqsg
But maybe they bullshitting me. Since software is not covered under warrnatu,btohqsg
If it ‚Äòs software. Just do a clean install,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know Surface will be this bad.,btohqsg
so Wi-Fi is not listed in Network & internet??,btohqsg
At first  i did it myself. It worked. A few months later  it happened again and i couldnt fix it so i sent for repair. They fixed it and now the prob happened again,btohqsg
I had Surface tablet before. The keyboard won‚Äôt connect to the tablet properly.,btohqsg
Mine is the laptop  not the tablet haha,btohqsg
if this happens you should check the device manager,btohqsg
I gonna sent for repair tmr and hopefully i get a replacement,btohqsg
Intel¬Æ Wi-Fi 6 AX200 or AX201Surface Laptop 3 (15 in. with Intel)  Surface Laptop 3 (13.5 in.)  Surface Laptop 4  Surface Laptop Go  Surface Pro 7  Surface Pro 8  Surface Pro 7+  Surface Go 3  and Surface Laptop StudioQualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network AdapterSurface Go  Surface Laptop 3 (15 in. with AMD)  and Surface Pro XMarvell AVASTAR Network Controller the rest,btohqsg
if it registers here that means ur wifi driver software is fine,btohqsg
I heard their reliability across all products not so good.,btohqsg
Double-click the respective Network Controller or Adapter  select the Driver tab  and then select Disable Device.In the warning box  select Yes.Then restart the network controller by selecting Enable Device.Restart your Surface by selecting Start > Power > Restart  or if you have updates pending  select Update and restart.,btohqsg
yea then u could do this,btohqsg
If i get a replacement im selling it,btohqsg
Push them to give you a replacement.,btohqsg
Ill try i mean they failed in giving a repair,btohqsg
I feel that they are trying to exhaust all avenues before finally doing that.,btohqsg
But i have 15 days of warranty left so idk whats gonna happen,btohqsg
Not very good for customer service ah,btohqsg
Send in ASAP before it expires.,btohqsg
They take 1+ week for repair and they couldnt even fix it,btohqsg
If they can‚Äôt fix it   you are entitled to a replacement.,btohqsg
Not your problem if they can‚Äôt fix.,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs how Apple does replacements,btohqsg
Or is it this adapter is non-user replaceable.,btohqsg
Idk they said it was software,btohqsg
What did u do with it?,btohqsg
if the device can register the driver,btohqsg
then ur device is fine and the software is fine,btohqsg
register means u can see the device name on ur screen,btohqsg
like ur pc can register the device,btohqsg
Where do i find the device name,btohqsg
Sorry im not a very tech savvy person,btohqsg
Does that mean my software is fine,btohqsg
I think this happened twice already,btohqsg
I did this too but then the problem came back,btohqsg
Then will be wifi card issue.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they can replace the card.,btohqsg
Computers these days are mostly soldered in for parts.,btohqsg
Hopefully. Dont think ill buy another microsoft laptop again haha,btohqsg
If my art test is positive after 7 days I can still go to school right?,btohqsg
Like do I have to self report,btohqsg
So I can enter malls already?,btohqsg
Uncle think Unsupported User is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg

Hey all  wanna know what are my chances of getting my 1st choice for JPAE.  I graduated from Higher Nitec with 2.461 GPA. I applied to Common Sports and Health Programme in RP. The Min GPA was 2.0  and there isn‚Äôt a JPAE Band as it‚Äôs a new course.,btohqsg
i think can be decent  cos new course  but dont hold any high hopes ah,btohqsg
If I applied to JPAE Shld I apply DAE too?,btohqsg
anyone else gotten their o lvl appeal results,btohqsg
u wanna appeal to poly ah,btohqsg
tp just opened the order for the laptops and i'm back to square one bc i can't decide,btohqsg
or should I buy from courts or smth,btohqsg
What kind of laptop are you üëÄ for?,btohqsg
that's why... idk I need it for common biz,btohqsg
I guess you can use Mac right?,btohqsg
does it support Microsoft 365? ig it does right bc biz needs Microsoft all the time,btohqsg
365 is applicable on Office for Mac,btohqsg
I'm not sure if i need to do coding later on in the course though,btohqsg
Mac is a good choice for coding tho. My friend uses it for Uni.,btohqsg
my course doesn't require a mac or specialised stuff,btohqsg
I found this on the tp website,btohqsg
they didn't link it to apple idk why,btohqsg
Cuz most Apple laptops no longer use Intel.,btohqsg
You need graphics card but Apple doesn‚Äôt have it on the latest models. That explains why not recommended.,btohqsg
should I just stick to windows/microsoft?,btohqsg
I never have good experience with either Lenovo   Asus or Dell for their laptops so far. So it ‚Äòs hard to say for me.,btohqsg
same  i sent the lappy back to repair they never even close the bezel properly,btohqsg
I thought Asus was good with the sleek design but guess what the trackpad stopped working less than one year and they didn‚Äôt repair it.,btohqsg
They only want to get the job done.,btohqsg
slanted in power button  things all never close properly,btohqsg
The ThinkPad I used got issues with Bluetooth    screen hang etc.,btohqsg
That laptop costs $2K+. More like a üóë in my opinion.,btohqsg
After these experiences   not sure if I will trust Windows laptop.,btohqsg
I was told that ThinkPad is fantastic. The best of the best.,btohqsg
I also had Acer. The wifi card broke but at least it ‚Äòs still functioning.,btohqsg
I think in terms of reliability   it fares better than Asus   Dell.,btohqsg
Dell > SSD broke   computer was unable to start up.Asus > SSD broke   touchpad stopped working.Acer > Sound card   wifi card broke but otherwise still functioning.,btohqsg
U sound like u have so many problems with laptops,btohqsg
Yeah. Even LG Gram was bad.,btohqsg
dont rmb alr haha  old one de,btohqsg
U can buy faster ssd card if u wan,btohqsg
Whats the average lifespan of a laptop,btohqsg
I have a lot of issues with Window laptops. Dunno why. I find Apple still fares better.,btohqsg
my sis use asus 3 years she no problem eh,btohqsg
Idk i feel 3 years a bit too short,btohqsg
But yeah. Asus is your next best alternative for price and quality.,btohqsg
my windows laptop cannot use spotify and Discord at the same time,btohqsg
If u buy longer lasting laptop,btohqsg
nvr used asus before but heard its pretty good maybe u shld consider asus@jadorereve,btohqsg
ya that's what I was thinking... if I should get mac,btohqsg
but do u need the processing speed anot,btohqsg
business i know windows is good,btohqsg
as long ure not running too heavy programmes,btohqsg
^this is the store for student prices for Asus products.,btohqsg
One thing good about Asus is the laptops are quite light for the Zenbook series.,btohqsg
Dont use microsoft. Gives me nightmares,btohqsg
unless u can stick with ur macbook for like 5/6yrs,btohqsg
think ab how long u need the device,btohqsg
this was what I was thinking,btohqsg
but can you hold thru 6 yrs with the same laptop  is another,btohqsg
How long do u hold ur laptop,btohqsg
bc after poly i might still be able to use ma,btohqsg
my hp laptop 3 yrs alrd,btohqsg
but some people would wanna change,btohqsg
My laptop too but it is experiencing q a lot of problems lol,btohqsg
im in a dilemma bc of this,btohqsg
2nd time sending it for repair,btohqsg
1st ram slot got issue due to wear and tear  but i changed to 2nd slot,btohqsg
i'm contemplating if i should invest in a mac,btohqsg
I think ideapad seems to be q a good deal,btohqsg
Who else make Window laptops..FujitsuVaioHuaweiRazerThese 4 I have no idea on reliability.,btohqsg
u using for short term/long term?,btohqsg
depends on how long it last lor  better if long term,btohqsg
fix a choice for urself first then choose what laptop u wanna buy,btohqsg
One good thing about Apple is..,btohqsg
You can test run the product at your home for 14 days and see if you like it.,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt   just return it for full refund.,btohqsg
im loving my macbook pro so far,btohqsg
But Apple Store only! Not iStudio etc.,btohqsg
but i still get confused between windows and apple,btohqsg
Apple also runs student promo that can rival school ‚Äòs sometimes.,btohqsg
yea I checked the price but school pricing is more worth it bc got 3 years applecare+,btohqsg
is about 1.7k with normal student pricing,btohqsg
Oh mine was with cash back   free wireless earpiece and discounted AppleCare+. That is if they have such a promo.,btohqsg
i rmb they got such promo,btohqsg
but i forgot when it is,btohqsg
This is the most popular choice for students. MacBook Air M1.,btohqsg
hi! does anyone know someone studying in nus dentistry? (i‚Äôm a current j1 btw),btohqsg
I'm at courts rn and it cost $1799 for the 512gb,btohqsg
with student price should be 1.69k like that,btohqsg
im feelin like chaging to apple products,btohqsg
ipad + macbook but i do be boke,btohqsg
ya it doesn't have the applecare+ 3 years warranty,btohqsg
i got mine at 1.6K macbook pro 256,btohqsg
IDK man. Is it a good idea to buy on Shopee?,btohqsg
its from ShopeeMall  they have safety guarantee,btohqsg
my 256 i use 3 yrs havent even use half,btohqsg
I guess you can buy on Shopee.,btohqsg
i'd rather u get 256 then external SSD,btohqsg
But with the voucher and etc.   more worth.,btohqsg
Tablet standalone is no good for tertiary I think.,btohqsg
256GB in-built SSD  then add on external SSD  which u can plug out and connect to other devices,btohqsg
Computer n tablet now J1 like no use like that,btohqsg
Most tablets don‚Äôt run on full operating system unless you buy Surface and other Windows tab.,btohqsg
This is a good storage option.,btohqsg
id rather she buy 256 internal  then add on this one,btohqsg
hmmm should I buy from sch,btohqsg
and then i use icloud to store,btohqsg
But then again   no choice uh.,btohqsg
idh iPhone though cannot airdrop here and there haha,btohqsg
its a sign for you to change,btohqsg
High Storage was good if there ‚Äòs bootcamp built-in,btohqsg
but not like u use windows got sth like airdrop,btohqsg
But now. I don‚Äôt think it ‚Äòs attractive,btohqsg
i don't have the money to change LOL üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
@cauchycriteriondo we have a a lvls tele chat for SGE,btohqsg
applecare+ leh? if i maintain properly then...also bc the school pricing including 3 years apple care ma,btohqsg
hmm  as long as u dont anyhow download things  youre pretty safe from software issues,btohqsg
then ur hardware you must sayang ur laptop,btohqsg
Apple Care+ is worth it if you repair your computer at Apple. Like screens etc.,btohqsg
i dont drop my laptops one,btohqsg
I heard U.S AppleCare+ covers lost and theft.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know where I can find h2 practise papers or even Tys for subs like history and geog,btohqsg
@ifightagainstscamsi've decided on asus zenbook 14 ux425 le! the pricing around 1.4k with 2 years warranty,btohqsg
seen reviews and it seems to be q good,btohqsg
Good choice. It ‚Äòs a value buy. 14in that is lightweight.,btohqsg
yea it's 512gb as wellbattery life up to 15 hours too,btohqsg
I am not sure if the battery will last that long tho but you may charge it with a powerbank so it ‚Äòs good.,btohqsg
the batt hours take with pinch of salt la,btohqsg
cos sometimes your programmes may require heavy batt usage,btohqsg
always bring ur charger just in case,btohqsg
Powerbank with USB C is adequate if you prefer not to bring the charger.,btohqsg
yep! adapter and powerbank(in case no charging port),btohqsg
i got a feel of the laptop at courts and its not too bad,btohqsg
the school not selling this model so most likely getting from courts or asus website,btohqsg
it's not included in asus student discount though but it's ok,btohqsg
An a level study group we have,btohqsg
no ratings though... saw one on lazada got a lot of good reviews,btohqsg
this one is a slightlyyyy diff model,btohqsg
„ÄêSame Day Delivery|x6 freebies„ÄëASUS ZenBook 14 UX425EA-KI837W 1.17Kg | 14inch FHD 100% sRGB | Thunderbolt‚Ñ¢ 4 | Intel Core i5-1135G7 | 8GB RAM | 512GB SSD | Iris X·µâ Graphics | Win11 Home | 2Yr Warranty | UX425EA UX425 | Lazada Singaporehttps://www.lazada.sg/products/same-day-deliveryx6-freebiesasus-zenbook-14-ux425ea-ki837w-117kg-14inch-fhd-100-srgb-thunderbolt-4-intel-core-i5-1135g7-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-iris-x-graphics-win11-home-2yr-warranty-ux425ea-ux425-i317944551.html,btohqsg
Not sure what ‚Äòs the difference tho.,btohqsg
this is the exact one I saw at courts,btohqsg
and it has a lot more reviews,btohqsg
This one is the top seller for both Shopee and Lazada. The difference I realized is Thunderbolt 3 for the other one and Thunderbolt 4 ports for KI837W.,btohqsg
thanks for all the help! :)@KopiGaDai@ifightagainstscams,btohqsg
mac is all fun and games until u need to do ML or AI,btohqsg
training datasets will be a pain in the ass without a good gpu,btohqsg
if ur gna do conventional coding then sURE get a mac,btohqsg
Nowadays can use cloud computing to train AI/ML so it‚Äôs not the end of the world tbh,btohqsg
mm uh imo unless ur doing something heavy like gpt-2 774 mil params of gpt neo or gpt3 then its worth,btohqsg
as in it still can be done on ur own computer,btohqsg
but i checked cloud computing resources and they're insanely expensive,btohqsg
might as well buy a gpu urself,btohqsg
"believe me i had to do a ml project :""))",btohqsg
took the entire night to train a model vs spending hundreds of dollars on a basic 1070ti or anything arnd that performance level,btohqsg
Shag bro was thinking that maybe can use the free credits for like gcp but wow sounds harsh,btohqsg
i finish using my gcp credits liao HAHAH,btohqsg
