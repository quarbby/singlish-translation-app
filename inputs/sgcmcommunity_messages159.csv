Seeking feedback/advise on car paint protection coating.Currently I have the TitaniumSH coating applied. In future  if I want to use other type of ceramic coating  do I need to get the new vendor to remove the old coating first? Or new ceramic coating can be applied over the old coating?,btohqsg
see how long ur coating suppose to last,btohqsg
esp if u park under the sun,btohqsg
I understand coating doesn't last forever. My question was if need to remove the old coat first or just inform the guy about it and let them settle it before they apply new (different) ceramic coat.,btohqsg
It's gone when the next shop does polishing,btohqsg
Hi 👋My car having issues with ants 🐜Any suggestions to eliminate them ?,btohqsg
Tsk next time don’t eat in car,btohqsg
From top to bottom clear everything,btohqsg
The implied meaning is.. after its gone its gone.. cus before coating they will polish one time. So whatever coating u have.. also gone w the coating.. but just make a mental note of when ur coating supposedly suppose to end,btohqsg
I put ant gel for awhile,btohqsg
You'll need to visit a shop that specialise in removing such pests (ants/cockroaches). They will usually smoke them out then do a full internal cleaning.,btohqsg
Thanks for feedback. It's hard to gauge when the existing will be worn off. Guess I'll just inform the shop before they do their coating work. Thanks,btohqsg
U put water see does it stay,btohqsg
And whether ur door handles got crying marks,btohqsg
I use water to dry it,btohqsg
Er ur door handles there usually if it rains or whatever..,btohqsg
Before coating alot. After coating dont have. When coating wearing off  it’ll come back,btohqsg
Sometimes got the stain near door handles or behind or wherever lah,btohqsg
something worser than this but yes this,btohqsg
No I don't. I just have lots of small light scratches,btohqsg
then ur coating shud be fine?,btohqsg
Something like this. Once every 6 months I have to bring car back to shop for them to polish it. Thankfully it's free.,btohqsg
u ownself wash car or use automated wash ah,btohqsg
I have no idea how those 'scratch' marks come about as I don't even those outside of those areas. It's on all 4 door handles and I don't ferry ppl around  so I only touch driver side door handle.,btohqsg
I can understand if it's only at driver side handle to have scratches.,btohqsg
I remember reading somewhere before that because of that curved recessed portion for the handles  wind “cuts” in and sometimes with very fine debris  it will scratch the surface of the car. I don’t know how true it is though,btohqsg
got fine particles in the air,btohqsg
i mean if pebbles hit u  u will know,btohqsg
but sometimes very fine dust or whatever u cant see it nor feel it,btohqsg
but that's my take on the scratches,btohqsg
But for these micro scratches  I used to use toothpaste and it magically removes it. Currently using Soft99 and also gets rid of all these fine scratches,btohqsg
Toothpaste any toothpaste also can HAHA.,btohqsg
I bought it at Esso last year,btohqsg
I haven’t used it on the entire car cause I lazy but I’ve been using it for spot touch ups on these fine scratches and light stains and it works really great,btohqsg
It's just strange that it's at the car door handle area and not around the whole car. Can it be so specific that the 'wind cut' velocity is so great around the door handles and not at other areas of the car? hmmm,btohqsg
I assume the main body of the car is designed aerodynamically so wind glides through it but for door handles  it protrudes out so it will “cut” the wind. And the recessed area probably creates a small whirlpool effect? I don’t know the physics behind how wind travels so that’s just my assumption on how I believe causes these scratches hahaha,btohqsg
I'm driving a Honda Fit GR (2020). It's not exactly that aerodynamic. lol,btohqsg
It’s a very common problem but an easy fix so I don’t think too much about it. You can try toothpaste for a more DIY approach! It seems to work just fine but I don’t know if it may affect the paint condition in the long run so I ended up using a proper car wax to remove them.,btohqsg
Next time I'll use microfiber cloth and toothpaste to try remove the micro scratches.,btohqsg
Watson got sell the soft99 ah,btohqsg
Recently my car got alot dirt stains cannot wash,btohqsg
pretty sure it's nails from ppl who use the door  and if we carry bags on our body it brush against it. that's why fine scratches at the door handle area.even if you seldom open the door  you still use it once in a while.if it's caused by debris and fine particles  pretty sure front bumper would have gotten it badly instead of door handle.,btohqsg
That's the issue  too many scratches to be from ppl cos I don't ferry ppl that often to accumulate so much. Anyway  I'll just try the toothpaste 'fix' to see if it'll work the next round.,btohqsg
could have gotten those scratches from car wash too,btohqsg
it builds up over time.i seldom fetch ppl too. but i open it to put stuffs at backseat.starting to see scratches on mine too after 3yrs.,btohqsg

My original thinking is still why just around the handle area only? If car wash  won't it also apply to the whole car since they're using the same cloth/sponge to wash?,btohqsg
car wash they open your car to wipe inside.and petrol station car wash they always carry a pouch at the front. the zip always brushing agains the car  just nice at the height too.,btohqsg
Do you send it to automated car wash every now and then?,btohqsg
Do we have automated car wash in SG? Don't recall seeing any.,btohqsg
recently it's making a comeback.the spinning kind.,btohqsg
The car wash workers  I'm familiar with them  they don't have pouches. But the possibility of their nails scratching it when opening and closing is a possibility. Just that I wash at most once a fortnight if it's really dirty.,btohqsg
I was kinda expecting someone might mention it. lol,btohqsg
I see. It looks like battle scars from automated car wash to me. Check your c pillar as well. Those are common areas but you’ll probably need to shine light at it or view it from certain angles.,btohqsg
somehow or another sure will still open rear door.so over time the scratches will form.but just leave it will do  don't keep polishing down.cos everytime your remove the scratches  the clear coat is wearing down.,btohqsg
I can help them use! 🤭,btohqsg
I understand. So far I let it accumulate and I just return to the shop to have it polished (for free) while paying for a simple car wash (for their services). That's why I'm thinking of changing to a different type of coating next year when the time is right.,btohqsg
Yeah Im starting to see more upgraded to automated car washes hahaha,btohqsg
Honda paint is generally thinner so it is prone to scratches.,btohqsg
I'm using TitaniumSH coating. So the scratch should be on the coating or deep enough to go past the coating. Well  this was in my earlier post on the coating question. It's ok. I'll observe if it still appears when I use a different car protection coat next year.,btohqsg
Not sure how to answer. Original + patch (top up after 2 yrs) application?,btohqsg
I'm working in Ubi area  you need to recommend where it's located so we all know where to visit for those quick wash.,btohqsg

Any help is appreciated. Thank you 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Suggest u leave it there wait till the next servicing then patch it,btohqsg

But yours is just a small 1 . Maybe they can do it free for you.,btohqsg
Lower CG better mah .. 🤣,btohqsg
Give it a bit of a wash  then buff it out. Most of it should come off  whatever that's left  unfortunately you're going to need to paint. Most paint shops probably charge less than 80 for this....but make sure you go to one that won't turn your car into a colour palette.,btohqsg
Ok but Got a slight dent too. Wonder those dent plunger can pull it back,btohqsg
Yeah find a PDR and you should be good.,btohqsg

If not warranty will be voided,btohqsg
I heard from people that servicing can be done outside and warranty wouldnt be voided,btohqsg
call them to transfer the ownership to you,btohqsg

Most of them jst do outside and change oem parts,btohqsg
if not do outside shouldn't be a problem,btohqsg

Kah motor charge $384 jst for engine oil change,btohqsg
but its 5 years warranty right,btohqsg
u still got another 1.5 years to go,btohqsg
Outside meaning 3rd party workshops ya? Sooooo many out there. Dunno which one good even after researching. All claim to be affordable,btohqsg
You cfm get 1500 dollar fine,btohqsg
Yup my friend told me got news about it also.,btohqsg

If I buy a 2 year old car made in 2021 in the USA  its PARF redemption is on 2031 or 2033?Assuming the car is imported today to SG.,btohqsg
10 year coe starts only when its registered in sg so 2033  and USA is LHD so dont think can register here,btohqsg
Made 2007 but coe only start when imported in,btohqsg
It's a RHD car but I was told the PARF is based off original registration date (2 years earlier) and not the COE date,btohqsg
Not sure for such cases is PARF computed differently,btohqsg
How is it a RHD car made in usa? Or is it a jdm rhd car imported to usa first,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense also if the parf is at lowest value with 2 years left,btohqsg
If thats the case would it not make more sense to import from japan direct,btohqsg
Unless its your own car in the USA and u wanna drive it here  but whether the sentimental value is worth that much of the extra costs,btohqsg
Parf redemption technically can be done at anytime,btohqsg
So im not sure what u mean by parf redemption,btohqsg
U deregister when its brand new also will get back,btohqsg
They're saying I lose the right to claim PARF after 2031 even though COE starts from 2023,btohqsg
if thats the case i dont think anyone will bother importing used cars,btohqsg
means it only has 8 years of life,btohqsg
Especially when most imported used cars are the more exotic type,btohqsg
Aka parf value confirm a big amount,btohqsg
Think i get what u meant now,btohqsg
Actually makes it a lot less worth it,btohqsg
If u import a 3 year old car u are paying full coe for 7 years of usage,btohqsg
Because after 7th year u lose all the parf value,btohqsg
Unless its a cheap omv car like vezel where u only get like $3k back,btohqsg
The importer says he can declare an OMV 50% lower than the real price to reduce cost  not sure how that would work,btohqsg
Arf is based of off omv,btohqsg
So if the omv is 50% lower expect your arf to drop by that or more,btohqsg
Meaning to either tank the loss of parf at end of life or,btohqsg
Eh our country have what gtr,btohqsg
Or you want the new one,btohqsg
U wouldnt wanna give up the parf value then and just buy local,btohqsg
Unless u plan to renew coe anyway or not drive for that long,btohqsg
