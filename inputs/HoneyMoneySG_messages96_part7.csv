Unlikely to lose in terms of NAV as money market are usually on the safe end of the spectrum. Main risks are1. Yield decrease due to interest rate env change2. Currency risk (USD drop relative to SGD)3. Shock events (see short term yield etfs Mar-May 2020)Comparing to BGF World Technology Fund is like apples to oranges. Low risk (money market) vs high risk (equities),btohqsg

Hello  I got a question  does anyone know if the DCS D-Lite card helps with getting a better credit score?,btohqsg
May I ask if uob recognises a salary transferred in and transferred out immediately on the same day?,btohqsg
It is a simple try n test. Just do it and let us know the result.,btohqsg
Check in the UOB app if the interest tracker will recognize it. But my guess it wont.,btohqsg
Ya i could have done it. But my ticker already moved for this month. I have to wait till next month to find out myselfüòÖ,btohqsg
I believe for ocbc  they recognise the immediate withdrawal on the day. Because from previous post  some members are doing so to prevent the MAB from being disturbed. So I thought UOB might be the sameüòÖ,btohqsg
My guess it wont based on the fact credit card payments take a while to count into the $500 spending requirement under the interest tracker  so if we apply the same behavior for the salary transfer  then we can expect the interest tracker will also take a while to recognize it.,btohqsg
