like if it's within school grounds it's more reasonable i hope,btohqsg
cause like if its outside gym i can kind of understand why they dont allow,btohqsg

me @ As going off about woke idiots and the lunacy of the political left,btohqsg
U can argue that regret is something emotional which adds a necessary balance to the logical pragmatism or ideals of progress,btohqsg
Vitality is more of arguing for necessityie u argue that if I do not regret I cannot progress,btohqsg
U can also argue thay because of the cyclical nature of progress u need some form of regret to either break out or to drive the cycle because fundamentally u will end up experiencing the same thing,btohqsg
Yeah a levels stopped testing politics and IR topics recently,btohqsg
