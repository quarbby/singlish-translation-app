Yeah maybe PFE take up rate was too low,btohqsg
I'm sure that's the reason ðŸ¤£ cuz at least for me  I was going to open an account but changed my mind when I realized I could not get an AAPL,btohqsg
Good opportunity now then! Remember to usehttp://bit.ly/sgmoomoo,btohqsg
ðŸ˜… seems that we need an anti-spam bot in the group now,btohqsg
I do know and have used some good anti-spam bots  but their language is Chinese...  ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Thanks! Testing the shieldy bot now,btohqsg
BTW  how can I check whether I have been qualified for the free AAPL share? I just did 5 very small transactions during the daytime  but seemed nothing happenedðŸ¤”,btohqsg
"Click on ""Me"" tab at bottom rightGo to ""FREE AAPL"" or ""FREE stock""Takes around 3 business days to credit in",btohqsg
okay  I found it now  thank youðŸ‘Œ,btohqsg
Hi guys  has anyone missed Credit Card payment for 2 months straight before? Now they are issuing me $200 worth of late fee charges ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
How can this be as in how did I miss my payment?,btohqsg
I don't know what's going on  you can ask customer service,btohqsg
Basically  for Citi  the late fee waiver can only be done through robots lol. I have already requested for the waiver  but it was declined. Sadly!,btohqsg
Waiver for annual fee.. not late payment.. u can call to confirm..,btohqsg
Thanks  Hareez. Well I was directed to robots only. Lol!,btohqsg
Yeah  you will be talking to robot for annual waiver.. lol..,btohqsg
For Standard Chartered  i wrote in to the customer service department  to waive my annual fee when the bot rejected my request,btohqsg

Hi  has anyone tried to top up GrabPay with an AMEX card recently? I tried but failed  don't know why,btohqsg
Amex has such problems regularly.Usually just remove and add back a few hours later.Subject to grab daily topup limit of $5000,btohqsg
hi chris  since both tiger and moomoo giving AAPL  which platform would u recommend if only want to choose one?,btohqsg
Sign up for both to get 2 AAPL stocksThen use IBKR for lowest fees,btohqsg

Since Aug 17.Was 0.8% up until this week slight drop in markets,btohqsg
Some 9.9 deals today- DBS Grocery 8% cashback capped at $8- 3000 Grabpoints on $75 transaction,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ maybe it's because of the 99 sales,btohqsg
Anyone know of any good credit cards that is good for dining and grocery shopping without minimum spending? Haha!,btohqsg
Wa this one is everyone dream haha,btohqsg
I know :( Hard for me to hit minimum spending lol. I do spend a lot on other things  but those don't require credit card lol.,btohqsg
Using that now actually. Can't top up to GrabPay. LOL!,btohqsg
But use GrabPay to pay got rebates? I a bit noob in all these things. LOL,btohqsg
Yea encountered similar issue with amex before topping up grabpay,btohqsg
I know Chris mentioned something like 2.9% cashback? But not sure how that works.,btohqsg
monetary term cashback is 1.7 from the credit card itself,btohqsg
Yeah i going to apply to uob absolute today. Really good for paying premium insurance plus sign up get benefits closing 31st sept. Grabpay for points! Then got cashback for the uob card,btohqsg
Right! But don't have contactless payment damn sian. Anyone know why they do not have contactless payment? LOL,btohqsg
Helmi  when you say pay insurance  do you mean paying via AMEX?,btohqsg
There is. Apply for the grabpay card,btohqsg
I applied  but GrabPay can't link to my Apple Pay. Lol!,btohqsg
Have to open the Grab App. Sigh!,btohqsg
You can bring your grabpay card along with you then,btohqsg
I use my Apple Watch a lot and that feature will come in handy  but... Sigh!,btohqsg
No min spend and good rewards can't exist together (other than uob abs amex and grabpay combo),btohqsg
Swee  Bro! I am learning how to maximise the combo based on your video.,btohqsg
Yeah its a good move  do use my referrral link too!,btohqsg
Grabpay contactless only works with Samsung pay for now,btohqsg
Yes  ibkr  moomoo  tiger are all custodian,btohqsg
