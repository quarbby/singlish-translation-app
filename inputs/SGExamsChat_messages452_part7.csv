If can >10 students consistently  can easily rent a place and conduct bigger classes already,btohqsg
do you prefer 1 on 1 or class as an experience,btohqsg
oh ya thanks for the olympiad info i take a look later haha,btohqsg
teaching wise I prefer class.Because same content.,btohqsg
I every year basically just feel like a parrot,btohqsg
I personally think 1 to 1 is not necessary for most students. There's nothing more beneficial for 1 to 1 vs group for me  other than 100% of my attention and time.Find that it's a waste when I can help more students for same amount of time.,btohqsg
I have like severe adhd so itâ€™s more Beneficial for me,btohqsg
asking cos iâ€™m a TA and it feels similar like iâ€™m essentially supplementing what the prof went over in lecture,btohqsg
except itâ€™s not like they chose to have tutorials lol,btohqsg
have. Let pri sch student teach,btohqsg
i also wondering like when you have a class  how much do you actly spend on reviewing/teaching content vs getting them to practice,btohqsg
reviewing content nowadays not much time spent,btohqsg
but last time when first started it took massive amount of time,btohqsg
just my notes alone for JC is over 200 pages,btohqsg
practice questions are another headache. Took few years to prep as well,btohqsg
yea  but what you said is still good info,btohqsg
like the behind the scenes prep,btohqsg
during lesson time  for me is I reintro the chapter,btohqsg
because the students didn't catch in sch,btohqsg
but uni level should be different,btohqsg
should expect them to catch up already,btohqsg
iâ€™m just interested in pedagogy recently,btohqsg
so I would think spend first 10 minutes summarising,btohqsg
cos my supervisor used to be lecturer at hci too,btohqsg
then his research even touches on physics education,btohqsg
my personal research is only pseudo science based on students performance at A level and not under any MOE school ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but I think ideas will be similar,btohqsg
ok but for the level you tutor  by reintro do you mean essentially teaching it from scratch?,btohqsg
activation of prior knowledge  then scaffolding concepts,btohqsg
yea my TA course says this exactly hahah,btohqsg
in a way yes and in a way no. Expect them to remember O lvl stuff  but not remember A lvl stuff,btohqsg
I also teach things like basic nodal analysis to find effective resistance  this one not taught in schools,btohqsg
then style of answering. Each person has their own style. So I let the students decide which style they want to follow  mine or their school,btohqsg
my style not all the time the best one  but I think it's a consistent one. Means can apply consistently and predictably,btohqsg
I actually picked up all these by thinking about it and not attending any course on teaching.,btohqsg
then when I discussed with fellow educators in the field then I learn these terms,btohqsg
then again  it's how it's applied.Different people scaffold differently.,btohqsg
