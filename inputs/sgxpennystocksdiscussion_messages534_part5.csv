Updates on Medi Lifestyle ($0.034/$0.035)Hope some of you joined with me when I added $0.030 yesterday.In fact on last Monday when the news of the JV Bio- Gene related news came out  I matched in 25 and got out 28-30. Within 10 mins I think. Shared the news here but didn‚Äôt type that I bought as it ran too fast and was afraid they might turn so was focusing on it.- Anyways  very strong closing yesterday.- weekly chart is very positive. High volume break out of downtrend line.Nevertheless  market still not firm and easily can get trapped if dont react fast enough.I‚Äôve played this counter many times before (last time it was know as IEV) and there are insiders who have came out to sell at 37-39 previously.I believed this coming Monday will open at least 36 but to chase or not  I cannot advise as the next nearest resistance is about 38.For those who are holding  pray for a good run.Vamos and happy weekends.PS: I do hope this one run because it will wake up many old pennies,btohqsg
