Guys  generally if buying relatively new car  one year old  am I wasting money for sending in for pre purchase inspection? It looks new  smell new  check the engine  all clean and tidy. Any opinion?,btohqsg
Depends. The minute the engine is cranked and driven on the roads  there will be mechanical risk and risk of accidents. Up to every individualâ€™s appetite for such things. Also PI/AD  adoption fee payable etc etc etc depending on make. some will say youâ€™re wasting money. Some will say youâ€™re spending good money.  How? What is your opinion? First car?,btohqsg
