kind of haha i know its really a gamble but i've seen quite alot of people did that (from reddit/youtube/tiktok),btohqsg
also i see trading is quite fun,btohqsg
Singsaver will bring you to Citibank's website to sign up  so you'll get the sign up bonus once you hit the eligibility.Just in case not clear enough  yes get both.,btohqsg
Oh thank you@MelvynEzi. You are the best!!,btohqsg
lol it's only fun when u're winning. 90% of traders lose money,btohqsg
what about options? did u do options before?,btohqsg
what's the difference btw trading options and trading stocks or whatever,btohqsg
Only if you're the 1-20% of the traders who win the trades.Imagine being in the 80-99% and going into debt  maybe not so fun after all ü§™,btohqsg
If these people actually earn a decent amount from trading  they wouldn't be wasting their time creating high production value videos and selling courses ü§™,btohqsg
Another one bites the dust...!BannedChua Mei.,btohqsg
it's hard to beat the S&P500,btohqsg
Ask yourself how much loss u can take before jumping into the gamble (be it trading or investing.) Dont count the money when it is not realise yet (paper gain is only paper gain. It is not finalise until u realise it).I guess it is not social norm for people to create youtube advocating how much loss they incur for trading?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone have any idea on how to invest into India‚Äôs stock market index through IBKR?,btohqsg
90% of day traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days üòÖ,btohqsg
Excuse me  can I ask for uob 1 account  if i still have pending charges for the credit card that hasn't been posted  will it be counted towards to 500 min spend For eg if I spent 500 on 31/1 but the charge is still pending do i still fulfill the min spend?,btohqsg
Also the ones that have truly found a method of trading that is profitable in the long term  would not be so keen to widely share such a method. Once enough people know about it and the market adapts  it stops becoming profitable ü§î,btohqsg
Has anyone tried requesting Citi to credit the 10 reward points that was not credited for Amaze transactions between 20 and 24 January?,btohqsg
I seem to keep buying high and selling low‚Ä¶ ü•≤,btohqsg
I think it is 90% of day traders lose money.Not 90% of all traders lose money. Look at how bank traders can rather consistently make money for their banks,btohqsg
fair  I suppose OP was thinking about day trading tho,btohqsg
banks no longer do prop trading...most teams have spun out or moved to platforms,btohqsg
In order to trade at the level of the banks  you need infrastructure and information at a level that is not feasible for the home trader. So for someone looking to quit their job and trade their own money full time  the 90% figure is pretty accurate,btohqsg
Maybe the key is the word ‚Äútrade‚Äù. Which probably means harder to make money.Typical buy and hold should still make the average investor decent money.,btohqsg
Maybe he just want to see the total lor ü•¥,btohqsg
you will not have 3mil in a month üòÖ,btohqsg
Yup. Buy and hold is investing  not trading üôÇ,btohqsg
I have a quick qtn. I set up my singtel bill for recurring payment on my uob one debit card.Tis will count towards my $500 spending per month right?I intend to put my electricity bill too. Just to hit the $500 spend per month.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob debit card $500 recur‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone know how to check current cash back status in Citibank app?,btohqsg
If one has enough assets to buy and hold and generate regular income  that could replace a full time job's income.YMMV,btohqsg
Purely illustrative example:If one has $10 million cash now  can buy 10 year Singapore Government Bonds at about 3% p.a. now.That would generate $300k Fixed Income per year or $25k per month.And I dare say this strategy is 100% make money at face value.(Lose to inflation or not I cannot comment  because my take is if you are not buying big value items  actually inflation even at 5% won't dent much of your monthly income).,btohqsg
To be very very clear  I am not suggesting anyone do this. I am just giving an example. Building a robust investment portfolio with a high certainty of return without much chances of losses is highly complicated and not something I think can be covered easily in a public forum.,btohqsg
no... the 7.8% is only on the final tier's balance... not the entire 91k,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.pageread this and see the picture,btohqsg
7.8% is on your $75001 to $100000,btohqsg
each batch of 25k earns different interest  if you have total 100k then average out is 5%,btohqsg
Hi as long i‚Äôm pairing amaze with CRMC i should be getting 4 miles per dollar right?I checked heymax and it only states 0.4 miles even though the mcc is not on the blacklist,btohqsg
It's pretty clear on the tnc. EIR 5% p.a. if you have 100k. So that's 5k a year.,btohqsg
Which card is best for big purchase above $10k?,btohqsg
Are you buying insurance or furniture?,btohqsg
If you are paying $2000 on items with mcc code 5945  first $1k is 4mpd  remaining $1k is 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
So as long as its not in the blacklisted mcc and i‚Äôm pairing with amaze. It will be 10x reward right?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Yes  as long as not excluded MCCs  you will earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Yea i was using heymax and it shows 0.4 instead of the 4 miles as long its online transaction. So was abit confused,btohqsg
Best way is to use heymax to check the MCC and verify against tnc. Some things have to check manually üëçüèª all the best for your miles accumulation journey,btohqsg
Can heymax and Digibot give different MCC? And what could be the reason for this?,btohqsg
Heymax.aiwill be the best to tell.,btohqsg
Perhaps one based on MC interface n one based on Visa interface? I m not too sure.,btohqsg
Heymax is using visa api... Might deviate from mastercard transactions.,btohqsg
