"Pika World Update: Some have asked if we think S&P 500 in general is considered cheap. Currently  the S&P 500 is trading at around 17.7x of its expected next 12-month earnings. This is slightly higher than the 10-year historical average of 17.2.We hope this context can give you a broader perspective of our ""still"" cautious outlook with doses of accumulation in VOO or favourite counters along key support levels.See you tonight on economic data release. Cheers!Pika Nat.",btohqsg

*BREAKING NEWS* China’s February composite PMI (leading economic indicator) released this morning strengthened to a multi-year high of 56.4  further extending its recovery into expansion territory that coincided with China’s shift away from zero-COVID to focus on pro-growth and domestic consumption1. February manufacturing PMI of 52.6 (consensus 50.6) is stronger than January’s 50.1 and marks the fastest pace since Apr-122. February non-manufacturing PMI of 56.3 (consensus 54.9) is also stronger than January’s 54.4  which suggests increased consumption and travel on the back of improving mobility and/or sentiment3. The government’s pro-growth stance is likely to be reiterated in the upcoming Two Sessions  which should fuel recovery momentum4. News is positive for companies with major operations in China5. CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) benefits from the rebound in domestic consumption  with the last overhang removed alongside rental rebates and mobility restrictions6. CapitaLand Investment (CLI) is a key beneficiary through its c.36% exposure to offices  malls  and operations in ChinaHutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) and Mapletree Logistics (MLT) should gain from improvements in production/consumption  mobility and trade that bodes well for shipping and logistics7. Relief for tech manufacturers with operations in China e.g. Nanofilm and Aztech on the supply side  though waning global demand remains a concern,btohqsg

China's factory activity stuns with fastest growth in a decade1. BEIJING  March 1 (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February  an official index showed on Wednesday  smashing expectations as production zoomed after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions late last year.2. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) shot up to 52.6 from 50.1 in January  according to China's National Bureau of Statistics  above the 50-point mark that separates expansion and contraction in activity. The PMI far exceeded an analyst forecast of 50.5 and was the highest reading since April 2012.3. Global markets cheered the big surprise in the PMI with Asian stocks and the Australian dollar reversing earlier losses  the offshore yuan perking up and oil rallying  as investors took a more optimistic view on China's economic prospects.More here,btohqsg
