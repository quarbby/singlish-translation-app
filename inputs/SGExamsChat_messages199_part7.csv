Econs honestly feels easier than half humanities subjects,btohqsg
Nvm i cant humanities to save my life,btohqsg
If counter argument they accept such a short answer and maybe a give a short evaluation maybe write 40 words in a concise manner 8 marks alr can get,btohqsg
U intend to go poly or jc?,btohqsg
So i need to count humanities,btohqsg
I intend to go Jc unless if my L1R5 too high,btohqsg
Ssgeog since im single humanities now,btohqsg
Didnt help me much other than more time to study ngl,btohqsg
Oh sad but I think econs can replace humanities for poly,btohqsg
It can somehow be treated as a humans subject for poly only,btohqsg
But my humanities are like C5-6,btohqsg
If econs could be used as humans subject I wouldâ€™ve thrown away geog and ss long time ago,btohqsg
Donâ€™t worry honestly after seeing how lenient the Cambridge mark scheme is u should probably get at least B3,btohqsg
Its bc of that i spend more time on other subjs but econs still turned out worse,btohqsg
Just write nonsense theyâ€™ll somehow find ways to award marks,btohqsg
Actl if i did i wldve helped out with the bellcurve,btohqsg
Eh so u dropped the subject after prelims?,btohqsg
Like i attended lessons and all but,btohqsg
Wrote in to my sch to say im not taking,btohqsg
U seriously shouldnâ€™t the mark scheme is so lenient legit wasted opportunity,btohqsg
In prelims my paper 2 25/90 ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
Now a whole 2552 ppl know how shit i am,btohqsg
I bet even if u get some random person taking o level but didnâ€™t take econs and they anyhow did the paper using common sense can still get at least C5,btohqsg
Ive no idea how it added to 25 tho  seems alot considering every single qn i get <10,btohqsg
U probably wouldâ€™ve gotten at least B4 if you just kept writing nonsense using common sense in o level with the lenient mark scheme,btohqsg
For prelim I couldâ€™ve gotten above 80/90 for paper 2 if I had 5 more mins,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t manage to finish my last qn,btohqsg
But if somehow I screw up for the actual Os and my answers arenâ€™t accepted I might drop to A2,btohqsg
So ur gonna count econs in ur l1r5 for sure?,btohqsg
Even for geog LORMs I write thirty times as much as the amount of content in this sentence I probably canâ€™t even get all 8 marks,btohqsg
I didnt do the whole tsunami lorms,btohqsg
Tbh i didnt do the whole q6 for ss too but,btohqsg
I mean in geog need three body paragraphs and all the examples probably need like at least 2 pages to write a good enough essay for 8 marks,btohqsg
Eh so 2 factors is enough for 8 marks?,btohqsg
Walao then my sch lie to me,btohqsg
I think if u compare the 2 factors they ask abt in the qn v well then evaluate with a stand can get 8,btohqsg
My tourism i cant rmb everytg so i smoke lol,btohqsg
Ok but writing a sentence with 9 words  certainly cannot warrant L2/4 lol,btohqsg
In econs 8 mark essay questions just write like the 9 words I stated above get 4 marks alr in some cases,btohqsg
Yay no more geog after sec sch,btohqsg
Actually thatâ€™s probably true since n level they only give one page for their 6 marks lorms,btohqsg
Probably can only get 1 mark haha,btohqsg
So they dont need to evaluate?,btohqsg
So write everything correctly 6 marks,btohqsg
Well good thing I did the n level paper as practice,btohqsg
One of the n level lorms questions was almost exactly the same as one of the tourism o level lorms question,btohqsg
3b is almost exactly the same,btohqsg
My Cher said in the last few years the o level paper uses at least one question thatâ€™s very similar or exactly the same as the n level paper from the same year,btohqsg
cos i nvr study weather HAHAH,btohqsg
So good thing I listened to my Cher advice lol,btohqsg
