i have owned all continental cars except the mazda,btohqsg
therefore i think i know what i am talking about,btohqsg
this is not an attack on bmw car owners or continental car owners. i just say it the way it is. because i also own bmws since 2004,btohqsg
End of the day itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s own choice on how to spend their money and time. As long as they are happy with what they have. Different cars cater to different wants  needs and pocket size,btohqsg
if enjoyment is upr uppermost prioprity and you do not mind the time and money spent on maintenance then okay.,btohqsg
for instance  many are surprised why i keep the e30 so long. i got these questions asked all the time. can you still get parts? get you still service it? wont it break down etc? and i drive the car to phuket,btohqsg
that is a big amount of time spent to maintain well,btohqsg
DP 23k + 54k loan quantum sir..Above monetary details is only the information i obtained.Disclaimer :I'm not related to nor have any business dealings with any financial institution.,btohqsg
Luck plays a part too.My friend just collected his F-Pace and found out his wireless charging don't work,btohqsg
take the money to buy stocks to help you buy car next time for free,btohqsg
Based on 30% of selling price,btohqsg
U donâ€™t floor the car ?,btohqsg
I floor daily and tyre burning fast,btohqsg
yes. more time spent in workshop for bmw cars than japanese cars all things being equal.,btohqsg
i floor the car but i dont jackrabbit tires.,btohqsg
i am supposec to change tires. kumho ps91 good tires? i saw this on audi rs,btohqsg
I floor at red light everytime,btohqsg
Some time at high way also,btohqsg
burns rubber i very seldom do,btohqsg
Kumho tyres are generally good and durable  perhaps slightly noisy,btohqsg
good value for money i think,btohqsg
used to be cheap and good,btohqsg
I agree! The noise on rough roads drives me nuts. Do you happen to know any tyres that arent as noisy,btohqsg
good but expensive tires on my m3,btohqsg
but on my mazda i want a change to less expenisve ones,btohqsg
Iâ€™m riding on Goodyear Efficient Performance Grip 2 (EGP2) right now. I find it very good  especially during rainy days,btohqsg
Previously I was on Kumho Ecsta HS51 for a very long time,btohqsg
Generally I think the price reasonable  I got mine at around $130 / piece. Mine is 225/45 17,btohqsg
Itâ€™s cheaper than Michelin and other higher end brands,btohqsg
Generally Goodyear tyres are equally reputable as well. In my opinion. Slightly more budget friendly,btohqsg
You can check some of the tyres out here for their verdicts,btohqsg
And the sidewall is not exactly ugly eitherðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
would like to seek opinion from the experts here - my COE vios is left with about 1 year but it's time to change tyre.. Should I go for 2nd hand tyres (nexen  kumho etc.) or tourador? haha.,btohqsg
what about the road noise? how bad is it,btohqsg
no. dont ever settle for used tires. dangerous and not safe. i had this ugly expericen way back in 2008 in malaysia when i had second hand tires. one tire exploded on my bmw. fortunatelky not driving fast,btohqsg
I think road noise is acceptable for me  as compared to Kumho. It is quiet enough for me,btohqsg
just buy new but inexpensive brand,btohqsg
Yes bro  avoid getting used tyres. You can look for newer but inexpensive ones. For 1 year or so usage  I think brand new Tourador would be good,btohqsg
Cause some people haven kena after saying so loud before the msians. Not nice to hear as well.,btohqsg
You go hermes shop buy stuffs also shout everything cheap,btohqsg
Saw one E36 on sale...but timed with 5 year COE. quite sad.,btohqsg
e36 aint so famous. or so not worth keeping. but yeah it is hard decision due to high coe,btohqsg
it is all luck. that i paid low coe,btohqsg
i saw one e30 coupe! this is a rare one. if you see it follow him and make him offer to buy. a collector,btohqsg
e30 manual i think probably less than 5?,btohqsg
i ran till like that i didn tknow... lol,btohqsg
luckily found out in 2013. toyo t1r,btohqsg
How come E30 is valued but not E36 ah?,btohqsg
"iut is more ""original"" for enthusiasts. and today many collectors all over the world are crazy about e30. but e30 is a better car. they say the 36 body strucutres not so strong. the rear top mounts cracks",btohqsg
the fun factor is higher in the e30. i thougoughly love it which is why i dont sell. many have asked me. some strangers come up to me,btohqsg
