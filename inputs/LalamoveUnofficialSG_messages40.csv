No show real advantage no paste sticker,btohqsg
Well unless u wanna use car to do bike jobs.. bike has no sticker advantage right?,btohqsg
I still get most i bid for,btohqsg
If got sticker in black  maybe can consider. Orange  no. 😂,btohqsg
What advantage? Join sticker program can secure job regardless of proximity to pick up location?,btohqsg
I use rental car gg la. No job liao lo,btohqsg
Hello all..i have a question.if let if we kena erp we bare the cost or customer?,btohqsg

Every 10min delay is 2$ lor,btohqsg
30 apr and 1 may +$3? Anyone else got the message?,btohqsg
Hi Bros change location how to charge,btohqsg
Need to contact CS to change and add money,btohqsg
Yea  best to ask the job creator do it,btohqsg
LLM CS reacts faster to them.. drivers use the live chat is hopeless,btohqsg
Ask customer contact CS. CS always reply customer one. Rider they dont care,btohqsg
Ya  partner with wife  easy to manage 😁,btohqsg
Can ask  but you may be ignored. I try before.,btohqsg
They are going to reward stickers driver more in future,btohqsg
First time grocery shopping  do i tel him pay me first???,btohqsg
Yes if big order just give him a estimated amount to send u and settle the difference on arrival,btohqsg
Bike 150  car 300.. is that right for purchase value limit?,btohqsg
Not sure leh  last time got fella askme.buycigarettes from 7 11....i make him paynow me first,btohqsg
I told him i will check IC also when i arrive lol,btohqsg

Helped a stay home notice guy   feels good to be thanked and with some tips lol,btohqsg
He's lucky to have LLM haha.. Such life saver service during such times,btohqsg
If paste sticker  they will know it’s llm. Never paste  they wont know. Fyi  pebble bay outside the guard house is a single lane road and there’s bus stop on each side of the road. Peak hours if you wait outside the guard house  you going to cause a jam.,btohqsg
Jokes  better dun take pebble bay jobs,btohqsg
Don’t paste sticker is the best.,btohqsg
You can just say you pick up  they think you do grab and they just let you in.,btohqsg
I recently saw got amdk doing llm,btohqsg
They will have special privileges bo,btohqsg
30th 1st got holiday surcharge  take short jobs,btohqsg
So customer cannot fav non sticker driver?,btohqsg
its a hard push. most llm drivers would be part-timers juggling multiple platforms. few people want to be moving advertisements for them.,btohqsg
Can't even solve their own shit,btohqsg
even if they gave the stickers 100% full matching override over non-stickers  i dont think there are enuff stickers around to impact the average non-stickers' income level.,btohqsg
but if they get that sticker critical mass  would be a differnt story. if they ever get there  no sticker eat grass.,btohqsg
Sticker also like tt  I sticker also eat grass 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Tips $4 on llm plus customer give another tips $10,btohqsg
Ask me how are u   I say Sun 🌞very hot then she give me $10 tips 😆,btohqsg
This is prolly the most secure condo in SG,btohqsg

Selective? I didnt get this msg,btohqsg
14 days to 12th May deadline. They will just silently convert the mpv accounts.,btohqsg
They been around many years liao leh. Tot quite established. Now still need sticker tactics meh😅,btohqsg
Good luck on getting a nice SUV with ugly stickers!,btohqsg
They are now targeting those SUV owners,btohqsg

Guess becos they started off purely as logistics moving companyMany ppl still dunno abt them  a few of my customers first time users,btohqsg
So this one is give warning liao issit 🤣,btohqsg

Buay sai laIf i lose 10kg it will be very worryingNeed go doctor liao 😆,btohqsg
Dont mind himDavidis high on drugs one,btohqsg
Registered but havent taken any jobsPrices a bit low  then realise they push their jobs to lalamove tooSo might as well jus take from lalamove 😄,btohqsg
I’ve been doing 2 years le. Just no sticker and OTOT. I live in town so it’s very convenient for me. I can walk to pick up and then drive to destination to drop off before I go and eat or run my own errands. Only do town jobs and short distance. I personally know a few others who are driving European cars and doing llm too. Some are their own boss with free time  property agents  pilots or retirees. The money is not bad as a side income plus no need to pay income tax. Offset a bit of petrol or cover annual motor insurance/ road tax also not bad.,btohqsg
There are quite a few high profile people staying there. The actress Zhao Wei has an apartment there.,btohqsg
Good for u  rich get richer... while the poor full time llm gets poorer fighting for orders,btohqsg
Wow nex time i say im dying hopefully customer give more haha,btohqsg
Think some use a template msg,btohqsg
So u will see trolley needed no matter for which vehicle type,btohqsg
Yikes okay. I hope it's a template.,btohqsg
Best is still to call them to confirm size haha,btohqsg
Last night took a bike job. In the end it's 2 huge plastic bags of frozen meat. Super heavy :(,btohqsg
LLM should come out new cat bike with trolley job,btohqsg
They surely know their app is horrible. Yet nth done.,btohqsg
I also had a customer who was trying to cancel her order yesterday. Quite auntie  she called LLM 6x yet couldn't speak to anyone.,btohqsg
In the end she send me sms not to come,btohqsg
I had to go to the chat for her and explain to agent to cancel. Waste time,btohqsg
It will always good to have multi platform.,btohqsg
A roo order on a raining day,btohqsg
Rich prob don’t do bah. They go for what also? I don’t think Property Agent  or retirees with no income are considered rich. OTOT and do doing llm in free time can’t possibly be fighting with a full time llm for jobs bah. The amount of time can’t even be compared. Even if there’s no one else doing and the jobs are the same volume  full time also can’t possibly do all jobs too.,btohqsg
Part time mah and same like giving tuition or grab hitch. Nv declare.,btohqsg
It’s don’t declare. I don’t think anyone doing grabhitch or any part time gig like llm will declare.,btohqsg
Last yrs never getCause 2019 high earner😂,btohqsg
They have many to catch lo.,btohqsg
Ikan bilis catch is waste time.,btohqsg
Even the penalty is small because the amount earned is so little.,btohqsg
But if you make a killing  better don’t play.,btohqsg
Our tax just few hundred dlrThey want catch sell curry puff 1,btohqsg
But tuition income is also very broad. You can be those give one lesson a week and earned amount similar to do Lalamove part or mavis tuition do big time one,btohqsg
More than 1k a month  you have to be committed and do every day for a few hours.,btohqsg
Few K for LLM is quite hard core,btohqsg
Full time possibly. But must mix with other jobs,btohqsg
1k in a week is achievable right?,btohqsg
Driving abt 4-5hrs a day for 30days  only abt 2k before deduct petrol,btohqsg
Then drive 8 hours. Rest in between,btohqsg
Don't drive 5 hours straight. Sure shag then want to go home rest and do nothing already,btohqsg
U sound like a Iras personal😂😂😂,btohqsg
Tax not much lahMy medisave pay 4k a yearBut income tax only 200++,btohqsg
I think u went the back door,btohqsg
Hi bros!any bros doing full time own van lalamove here ?,btohqsg
Grabhitch is not taxable as it is for drivers to recover some cost. That why limited to 2 trips per day.,btohqsg
Any1 knows what the criteria for getting the immediate jobs? Is priority given to distance?,btohqsg
Take before got people but need wait 10 to 20min,btohqsg
Wah. If any one of the stops there’s no one at home to receive or for some reason cannot deliver  you will have to bring the medication back to clinic. Cannot hang on the door  take photo and leave.,btohqsg
Almost it's me.. Lordy was just behind me when these two vehicles cut behind me,btohqsg
Anyone  signed up for the this?,btohqsg
Stated cannot take other job while doing this project but not sure how much paid.,btohqsg

I wonder how many active sticker driver out there vs active non sticker driver,btohqsg
Then why not all are taking?,btohqsg
I've seen it on the road. Not bad what,btohqsg
You all ah. Which 1 more important? Getting jobs priority or car looks?,btohqsg
I rather wear gf shirt and do,btohqsg
Bicycle cycle don't need to spend on petrol,btohqsg
Not everyone is driving their own carAnd some may be using their car for other purposes like business meetings and dont feel comfortable appearing to be llm's poster boy,btohqsg
Some may be doing this as a sideline without family or boss's knowledge,btohqsg
"Not only that  stickers advertising with that size  you should be getting $450-$900 per month  depends on size  not $50. Even you get jobs ""priority"" still don't add up. Think about it.🤔",btohqsg
LLM is just trying thier luck to get cheap advertising on ppl's property  on the move. Very Smart move! But we are not stupid. 😏,btohqsg
This is the very minimum you would be getting if you put decals on your car. No big stickers!,btohqsg
Tourador ok la  small one nia,btohqsg
For 50$  I only willing to stick the rear bumper one,btohqsg
The huge ones of both sides of the doors  not worth the 50$,btohqsg
Show only no do one Shag,btohqsg
If iphone keep stuck at apple logo   own self restart yet still stuck at apple logo   how ah? Anyone?,btohqsg
Tourador window decal is okAnd i feel its just as effective,btohqsg

How you do it ... 😅,btohqsg
Cheong and good stacks I believe,btohqsg
Town area not really  parking and traffic takes up quite some time,btohqsg
Yup  multi stops always very fast taken up,btohqsg
It helps if ur familiar with the area u stack,btohqsg
Sometimes GPS doesn't give u the fastest route. If u know certain small roads  saves alot of time,btohqsg
One day $300 . One month also 9k...when I grow up I aso Wana be like you🤣,btohqsg

I don't like the rush  so I nvr stack😂only try get multi stop or to and fro jobs,btohqsg
I think pple taking orders n sub-ing them out,btohqsg
How come i turn on duty but no orders on the pickup page?,btohqsg
now non stickers also no mission liao,btohqsg
Confirm no sticker means no see job?,btohqsg
Shd only be disadvantaged at the smart matching nia leh,btohqsg
think they just slowing down the app refresh rate for non-peak hours. the alternative explanation is suddenly most customers drop llm  or a sudden massive surge in drivers/riders. but peak hour jobs still flowing... so got to be system trickling the jobs.,btohqsg
I only see 1 advance order motor,btohqsg
standard bro. holiday everytime like this.,btohqsg

Once u call & making your way over  u must slide proceeding to pick up point  next one is swipe arrive at pick up point when u reach the place cos next page requires upload of photo,btohqsg
Wah the weather playing around with me,btohqsg
I sitting at home waiting to go out but forecast show rain now cloudy oni.,btohqsg

Thank you. Btw which is best location to standby for ikea order,btohqsg
Kfc and Popeyes I catch so many times with weighing scale,btohqsg

They always gather at the carpark there. However what I like to do is I go courts carpark cause i anti social,btohqsg
😅 idw cham so much I only talk to a few not everyone.,btohqsg
But order very fast lost leh dk if my hp slow,btohqsg
Hahaha 🤣. Tbh I camp there two weeks ago only got 3 jobs .,btohqsg
Boss sean  Mcd refuses to pay secure zone fee and now refuses to pay cancellation fee,btohqsg
Tell me client says drop.off at guardhouse only,btohqsg
CS asking llm to compensate ne,btohqsg
I kenna blacklisted by mcd also,btohqsg
I really feel like emailing mcd corporate and kpkb to them lol,btohqsg
Ya if it’s a secure zone  and they ask to drop at guard house  then bobian  no secured zone charge,btohqsg
I Kena before. They die also don’t want to give $15,btohqsg
BUT you can try telling CS security guard asked you to change pass  then they might have to give you $15. It doesn’t always work thou. Depends on which agent you get haha,btohqsg
This one I take before need to take photo & msg every drop.,btohqsg
Wad this person send  somebody sabo b4 until he so anal issit,btohqsg
Car job leh very big2 😂,btohqsg
How can I send message to customer?,btohqsg
Dont do this. I do before. Damn strict timing. Need message every customer then need message this nurul. Not worth one,btohqsg
Hi guys! I’m new. Just wish to check.. for such orders  how much exactly do I collect from the customer? Or do I just follow the amount under “total”?,btohqsg
"not this screen  the previous one. the number after ""payable by customer"" is the amount to collect.",btohqsg
Guys this is ridiculous.  Customer freely give order to different rider. But when I reached customer wanted to give a order to different location instead,btohqsg
When talked to llm I they gave stupid response. Then wads the point of bidding sia,btohqsg
Is it from Orchard  near Wheelock place,btohqsg
I kena b4. Called no answer. When reach  they say another driver pick up n go liao,btohqsg
I called but number not in use,btohqsg
I reached in less than 15 mins,btohqsg
The thing abt the live chat is  they take ages to reply us,btohqsg
Then cust wanted to give me different order to Jurong.,btohqsg
Oddle can be trusted but still best to just call  for the rest I always call till they pick up or I call the receiver so tt even if it happens I can say customer was waiting for me to deliver n ask for compensation,btohqsg
I don’t see the point of the bidding,btohqsg
My case was big restaurant. Lingzhi😂,btohqsg
Sometimes they purposely do 2 orders one for bike and one for cars whoever pick up they will cancel the other one,btohqsg
In the end gave me the 50% price,btohqsg
I came from Telok Blangah to novena in less than 15 mins,btohqsg
Yes these kind of last minute cancel sucks,btohqsg
I left the Cs chat on,btohqsg
So that when reach I can kpkb,btohqsg
I ganna the exact same thing before   double order  last min cancel  all I can say is some is beyond our control... What we can do is always call them  invalid number then I decide to take or not  I got request to take away my order before... Just move on to the nx lo,btohqsg
Will always have some bad customers,btohqsg
Tt time I stack far east plaza and opposite order then I call but they nv pick up so I go   in the end only got far east order  the other double order and was picked up by someone else,btohqsg

Royal Briyani and Royal Indian (Jalan Besar) best to avoid. Their jobs can sukasuka change and add new location without informing you prior. You see 2 drop off locations on screen but when you reach the shop and check your app  suddenly have 1 new drop off location. At night they sometimes have a difficult time getting drivers  so should you accept their orders  check the deliveroo receipt for the order’s delivery timing. I kena before 3 orders. 2 of these orders were already late by 1 hour. Customer give me a tough time when I reached the house. Refuse to accept. Briyani shop act blur and never informed me. Tell me to “persuade” the customer to accept the food otherwise they will not get paid by deliveroo and they would have wasted money paying delivery driver. I blacklist both le. Those taking their job just be careful. A lot of pattern one.,btohqsg
I was there when they first opened  say got welcome gift   also nv give or offer to give,btohqsg
Ah neh very good in twist n turn . Dats y alot can become lawyers or ceos😂,btohqsg

If let sat they schedule at 11am but they say 11.30 we can charge them,btohqsg
I have no problem with the delay & don't want to charge  just want to avoid being blamed for being late,btohqsg
Customer can change timing without charge  cos u not there yet,btohqsg
Ask customer to call CS to change timing,btohqsg
U charge them even when they told u way beforehand  LLM suspend u man,btohqsg
If u not ok with the timing change  can cancel without penalty,btohqsg
This isn't a delay  this is a change,btohqsg
