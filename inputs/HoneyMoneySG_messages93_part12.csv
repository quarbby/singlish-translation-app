i remember why i leave $10 already and not $0because UOB One has funny things like last day credit you $4 interest for the month.So if you do things like leave $0.00  thinking your day end balance is $0  when it is actually $4 for example..Then when you play the promo you go and do $100 000.00 exactly  you might fail the incremental funds $100 000 check..so i always have some buffere.g. day end balance $10  incremental funds $100 100...just to avoid unnecessary trouble and don't have to ask.. how come i didn't get earmark properly ah,btohqsg
can counter by remembering to check on last day and move out anything that comes in? still end day $0?,btohqsg
i think UOB credits the $4 interest at 11.xx pm.. haha,btohqsg

what this means is the annual yield for the past 1y is 3.2595%,btohqsg
why they credit on last day but can't see anything till the next day? haha,btohqsg
