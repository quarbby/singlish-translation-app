Called out Beng Kuang earlier 74/75 at 4.49pm. Hope some caught it and read the sign 🪧.Anyways good close for them as they flushed aplenty and closed day high 79.Since tomorrow is last day of the week. Just glanced on the weekly chart. 82 is key. If tomorrow opens 81 82 tomorrow. High chance many will join the break out play 82 . If market momentum strong  the next resistance should be 90If weak and cannot clear 82 convincingly  then have to decide to Tp earlier as they might flush again.Good luck to those who joined .Tomorrow might be a happy days for pennies.Huat! DYODD too!,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 23 Sept 2022🎉💣Recession fear is mounting🔫Thursday saw another fall for equity markets  with technology stocks taking the plunge. The Fed has successfully communicated its aggressive stance in the fight against inflation.The pain is that most Fed members see the rate climbing above 4.5% in 2023  higher than the prior estimate. We are now witnessing the 2-year Treasury yield  often seen as an indicator of the fed-funds rate in the future  climbing to 4.12%.Moreover  we still see an inverted yield curve between the 2-year and 10-year bonds. The US also feels the heat from global central banks that increase their interest rate.💰How does overseas rate hike affect US bond yield and the stock market?🗽This has been a question by Pika World friends. So let us dive into some details.First  the US bond market is less attractive when foreign bond yields increase. So  logically  money will flow out of the US bonds  lowering the price of US bonds and lifting their yield.The higher yield will then keep the dollar elevated since investors have to buy dollars to buy US bonds. When overseas rate hikes happen  it tends to push US yields higher and pressure the equity market.🎁Is interest rate the only scare?💸Pika World thinks that the main fear lies in corporate earnings. The economic ramification of a steeper rate coupled with a firmer dollar will likely hit earnings from current expectations.We are seeing forecasts falling in most sectors  and more could be on the horizon. As it takes time for consumers to cut back on their spending given the rate increases  investors could also brace for another downward earnings revision. After all  monetary policy wings have a long lag effect on the real economy.Our positions on small caps continue to be hammered  and Pika World remains defensive while bracing through the snowy winter chill season.📮What’s on the menu today?🔑At 9.45 pm  we will receive the Manufacturing PMI. It is expected to see minor moderation to 51.1 from 51.5 in the prior period.Service PMI will also be delivered at the same time. We expect a slight improvement to 45.0 from 43.7.Uncle Powell will speak at 2 am  and it might give some catalysts movement to the market.It is 23 Sept  Friday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. It is the last trading day of the week  and Pika World wishes all friends a recharging weekend ahead!,btohqsg
