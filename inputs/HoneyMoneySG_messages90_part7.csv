I did review the UOB funds available and this fund seems to be one of the stable and consistently paying dividends but of course I don’t expect crazy dividend,btohqsg
Those rates come from in the app  and are updated every month (I think) ... 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Hi guys  may seek for some advise? I pay my HSBC Credit card last Saturday using DBS payment  the due date is 13 February(today)  but the transaction haven't posted yet  should I just wait tit to be posted then appeal for the late charge?,btohqsg
Were you charged a late fee already?,btohqsg
No charge then how to appeal? Just wait.,btohqsg
So  rush to pay bill now( on axs machine maybe) also pointless? Or just appeal late charge easier? 😂,btohqsg
Just wait for the the transaction to get posted,btohqsg
You shall pay at least 3businessdays in advance to avoid any worry. The only way now is for you to call HSBC CSO to check have they received the payment but not yet display on your account.,btohqsg
Yeah  forgot about public holiday...I checking with thier CSO too,btohqsg
do you have HSBC account? To play safe  transfer in money into HSBC Savings account.. and do internet banking payment now.,btohqsg
I don't have HSBC saving account,btohqsg
That one also takes some time for HSBC 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Amaze paired with citirewards still get 4 miles per dollar for hospital and clinics? Tks all the experts,btohqsg
I will just wait and appeal if inccur late charge as thier CSO suggested so  thanks all,btohqsg
The best way now is you place a FD  eg. $30k  in a bank to get a secured credit card with credit limit $20k or $30k. From there you rebuild your credit score slowly.Take care of your bank account n credit card. Don’t abuse it.,btohqsg
Technically he have one existing CC.. just need to increase limit and slowly fix the credit score,btohqsg
Quite curious  such cases won't affect income tax meh,btohqsg
depends on how HR / staff reports to IRAS loh..murky area,btohqsg
Exactly lol. Company not affected because end of the day it's still under operational expenses. 🤪,btohqsg
Anyone knows why my new uob lady credit card spending was not reflected in my uob one acct spending criteria? (My previous card was expired and they sent a new card with a new number.) Is there any linking procedure i shd do?,btohqsg
Can you confirm the transaction is posted? You should call uob if so,btohqsg
Hi all  can i confirm  atome with CRMC if do manual 3x payment (instalment) still can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ya normally it is posted the next day. But its been 2 days and spending is still zero,btohqsg
public holidays leh  wait at least 2 business days after transactions posted on transactions history,btohqsg
Did you check the app to see if it's posted? Lol,btohqsg
Yup posted on the credit card statement. But the uob one account details spending is still 0/500,btohqsg
Called uob centre. The rep say need to wait for few days before the new card would be refreshed in the app's system. Probably thats why..,btohqsg
What’s so good about this promotion?,btohqsg
I would say deposit the amount from 01 mar 2024 onwards.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  anyone knows what are the recommended ETFs that tracks the MSCI World Index?,btohqsg
Is it advisable to pay off hdb loan faster monthly via cpf? Eg instalment is $100 but I can afford to pay $200 using cpf so I pay $200 monthly,btohqsg
? Low effective interest rate (unless you did not max out your uob one account on 31 Dec 2023),btohqsg
The longer you drag  the more accrued interest you will incur. So its better to.Maybe you will want to explore doing a lump sum reduction every year after your bonus if your job pays you bonuses?,btohqsg
If u can get higher returns than 2.6% then feel free to invest with cash.,btohqsg
Conservative way would be to pay up quickly.Balanced way would be to maintain the current instalments of $100 and use your OA to buy t-bills (instead of 'pre-paying' your HDB loan) which currently still outperforms the 2.6% that u are paying for HDB loan.,btohqsg
just need to empty out uob one on 30 Dec  then can get extra cashback on top of the full 5% on $100k,btohqsg
Yup  the only use case is assuming one did empty his uob one ac on 31 dec.,btohqsg
