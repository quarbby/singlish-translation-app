Oil prices had been dropping continuously from US123 per gallon till below US100 now.Our pump prices instead increased a few times when the oil prices plunge.Only these few days  did our pump prices started to drop.That MP whom had rebutted Dr Lee Bee Wah  when she raised the issue of the pump prices in Parliament - he claimed that our pump prices drop faster than go up. Likely  he gotten his data from outer space,btohqsg
