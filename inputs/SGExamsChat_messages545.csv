our medics getting fked left right centre for not submitting checklist,btohqsg
is there anyway to intervene should your friend be actively abused but she refuse to leave  and when she tries to leave the relationship  he will physically force her,btohqsg
much as i want to call the police  i dont want to go to such lengths  yet.,btohqsg
Evidence..try to get as much evidence as you can..not being a involved party  that is all you can do right now,btohqsg
Its all about building up a case,btohqsg
i dont understand the victim's mentality,btohqsg
and still think he will change,btohqsg
like i know its hard for most people to comprehend,btohqsg
ill help you understand..it has very simillar reasonings to a parental and child connection..Like some people just wont leave their parents even though they know they get abused by them,btohqsg
my gf and I we even offer to let her stay at our place,btohqsg
Afraid she won‚Äôt experience the same love he GAVE her previously,btohqsg
I got a feeling she is fearful 100%,btohqsg
esp since she‚Äôs under her bf control rn,btohqsg
she isn‚Äôt rly open to the outside world per say,btohqsg
then she was like huh you didnt even text me,btohqsg
then i see that guy deleted the messages on her phone,btohqsg
i legit cant understand why males mostly do this..like  even to their parents some guys are like this,btohqsg
i honestly feel like crying tbvh out of empathy,btohqsg
they themself have the fear of losing someone who support them lor,btohqsg
like my worse one worst case we just cold shoulder few days,btohqsg
there is no GBH only ABH,btohqsg
yeah im in law i know like the legal side,btohqsg
i know of a friend's relative that withness a dv case get settled by another neighbour calling on a noise complaint,btohqsg
im trying to not go there,btohqsg
"the dv victim  place some blood on the gates of her door before she knew she was abt to ""get it"" from the husband",btohqsg
so noise complaint  police turn up...see blood on the gates  case closed,btohqsg
i mean told him the short answer to the qns was basically nothing,btohqsg
but he could gather evidence on the sidelines,btohqsg
yea..but i think if one day can get some concrete evidence..then it would be good..better than nothing?,btohqsg
lets talk abt the billion dollar confiscation,btohqsg
Singapore police seize S$1 billion in property  luxury cars and other items as part of a forgery and money laundering probe.10 people were arrested in the raids at Good Class Bungalows and condos.https://cna.asia/47Bd8CQ,btohqsg
im very sure this is not a rare occurence,btohqsg
sorry there arent many GCBs in singapore ah,btohqsg
how was this not flagged out earlier,btohqsg
i rmb reading cases of sg seizing whole ships..im pretty sure those are worth more than 1billion,btohqsg
bruh im just talking facts...im not even guessing,btohqsg
I mean yea there has been a period of time where nothing was seized,btohqsg
Detain and seizing got differences im sure..but  assets wise i dont think the number is that far off,btohqsg
But dont these meant that if these ships dont pay  singapore can seize them indefinitely,btohqsg
idk enough..but i just did not see the number as being a huge number..cause i know the value of ships,btohqsg
yea maybe i was wrong to say that it was common,btohqsg
I like how the 1bil became 700mil,btohqsg

Hi all  exam season is approaching and many of you may be struggling with subjects like physics or math. üò©Regardless of whether you are preparing for A/O/N levels  If you have homework  content  or any other questions while preparing for your exams  head over to my channel:‚Ä¢https://t.me/thephysicspage(Main channel)‚Ä¢https://t.me/thephysicsdiscussions1(Physics discussions group)The reason I created this page is to provide free help to students struggling to understand physics concepts! I also wanted to post puzzles which I found interesting so that hopefully you will start to see the fun side to physics :D Most importantly  I wanted to help students who are struggling to have someone to discuss their doubts or confusion with! (something i learnt during my time studying: no question is too dumb to be asked)For those who are not taking physics  I also share useful study and revision tips in the channel so there will be something for you guys too!Just some background: I studied PCME when I was in JC and took H3 in game theory and so if you have any education related questions (e.g.  how to study for certain subjects or wanting to find out more about the subject etc.) I will really hope to be able help you out! You can drop me a DM on telegram or instagram and I will get back to you üôåüèª,btohqsg
I rmb catching hmfd during the week I had 3 prelim papers,btohqsg
Whole week mc‚Ä¶.count not take my English or Chinese paper,btohqsg
18 years is crazy‚Ä¶as a rp lecturer,btohqsg
uhh i don't remember this happening,btohqsg
i completely don‚Äôt understand what that means but ok üòÉ,btohqsg
so this was the useless incident 777 that never disappeared even after a whole day,btohqsg
do u think u can push it up,btohqsg
and how r ur other subjects,btohqsg
Weird ass boy says hi to every strangers on the bus and clearly made students uncomfortable,btohqsg
When I didn't reply back he quickly flipped the bird lmao,btohqsg
Yea best is just ignore these ppl,btohqsg
He clearly doesn't know social behaviours,btohqsg
Him flipping me off shocked me,btohqsg
Wait until you encounter the people that die die don‚Äôt want to move infront of a mrt door,btohqsg
And you need to physically push them out just to get out yourself,btohqsg
i really want to go jc,btohqsg
and i only have 6 subj,btohqsg
I have a non-Chinese friend got a2,btohqsg
If it was the other one  guy who have been arrested,btohqsg
About a C/D kind of grade to A is possible in 2 months,btohqsg
but actually what happened to lead to that question? I didn't read up,btohqsg
too busy recently  finally some room to rest,btohqsg
I read so much and only A2 last time.,btohqsg
is really study till vomit kind to get,btohqsg
First thing  why do you really want to go JC?The subjects are going to be much tougher than what you are currently taking.To me  the underlying criteria to do decently well in JC is an A1 or A2 for Additional Maths.Without that  H2 Maths is going to be a big struggle at least for the first year.,btohqsg
even if go sci/eng in poly taking amath is better,btohqsg
so if score A2 for Maths and B4 for Chinese that's still a 15 points for remaining 4 subjects.Need B3 B3 B4 B4Only then you can qualify for JC.,btohqsg
SG curriculum is so heavy in maths,btohqsg
all the ppl ik who could have taken amath but didnt all regret it,btohqsg
my school distinction for chinese is 33.7% so there‚Äôs a chance that if i get A1 for all subj  i can get into ejc,btohqsg
I don't teach Chinese  I can't comment also,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a chance but it‚Äôs not confirm,btohqsg
YIJC must come let me teach first üòÇSo far my rate is much higher than the school,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why honestly better just do it once then no need worry about it again ah,btohqsg
You can get A1 for the remamining subjects?Or at least A2?,btohqsg
also if cannot cope ino lvls  jc  is a whole other hell,btohqsg
will we be going uni same year,btohqsg
idw to go back to teepee,btohqsg
I have experience rescuing fish. If they die I do feel really bad and sometimes take it personally,btohqsg
and idk I mean like animals it‚Äôs different from humans,btohqsg
I mean we can just go see them to skip sch and not actl be sick,btohqsg
but animals it‚Äôs like they are really really sick when they go doctor,btohqsg
so if I can‚Äôt save em I prob will just get depressed and then eh lose my passion or smth,btohqsg
i scored b3 minimum for the rest of the subj,btohqsg
You can qualify for JC  but I do need to mentally prep you that the amount of work you need to do in JC to do well is at least 5 times of what you are doing now for O levels,btohqsg
for next year JC students  the strategy is quite different  so you really only need to focus well on 3 H2 content subjects and ignore the H1 content.,btohqsg
So there's still a good chance if you are willing to put in the work.But this is without any further assessment of your current capability. B3 can be quite widely varying  depending on students  so I can't judge any further,btohqsg
Hi guys I‚Äôm wondering if I should retake mt o levels I got an A2  my other subjs don‚Äôt usually get As so I was wondering if I should put in more work for my other subjs or retake paper   honestly I don‚Äôt think Im gonna put in a lot of effort when retaking I think I‚Äôll just sit thru the classes so I can retake,btohqsg
A2 TO A1 for mt...is like abit of a stretch,btohqsg
I thought A1 is 75% and A2 70%?,btohqsg
Uhh I‚Äôm fine with both jc and poly my plan is to see my raw score when I get my results back and then decide from there,btohqsg
lmao..i think my definition of scale is off,btohqsg
But im basing off the fact that the qns usually a A1 student will answer correctly requires more luck than actual knowledge than the A2 student that answers wrongly,btohqsg
My other subjs are like a mix of A B & Cs,btohqsg
its always that one outlier qns that saperates a A1 from a A2,btohqsg
Give me a second let me check,btohqsg
that may apply to maths and science..but languages  its very hard to be prepared tbh,btohqsg
"thats why i mentioned luck...unbeknownst to you the paragraph includes a word.. then ""explain this word""",btohqsg
Cs i feel like my other subjs are harder to score A in,btohqsg
Hi my humans got a B4 in my most recent test,btohqsg
i just think the chance of loosing marks on languages is higher than a maths or science paper..and that throws a A2 from a A1,btohqsg
Afterall..its many more components compared to the other subjects,btohqsg
Cs my grades for mt always bounce between A1&A2 so I was wondering üòÖ,btohqsg
maths is always known to do that,btohqsg
there is always that one stupid qns...,btohqsg
Is humans very important actually üòÖ,btohqsg
Ohh okay thanks for all the help ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Uh I thought u were one of those anime binge watches Idk what your age is üòÖ,btohqsg

idk if I should go to Sec 5 or ITE,btohqsg
my score prob can‚Äôt go to Poly since my English is grade 4,btohqsg
idk if this helpsN level prelims-28N levels-19O levels prelims-25O levels-26Y1 common ICT (RP)Y2 D3D (RP),btohqsg
The course I want needs grade 2 English,btohqsg
personally I think grade 2 for English is damn hard.. if your course score is near the 26 region should be ok if sec 5 but note you rly need catch up a lot ah,btohqsg
bro it‚Äôs damn hard for them,btohqsg
it‚Äôs becoming o level standard lowk,btohqsg
o level but prev stall is,btohqsg
now syllabus is hard as fuck,btohqsg
If I go sec 5 I will still be doing old syllabus btw,btohqsg
Rp has common programmes for all schools.SO even if you dont get in the grade 2 english diploma you choose...you can still get in a common programme.In y1 sem 2 of the programmes you will be transferred to the diploma you choose,btohqsg
but u need do well for the mods too ok,btohqsg
that is good. What is the entry points for your course in rp?,btohqsg
but still  need do well still got competition,btohqsg
for my diploma..i had none ..that is why someone in my diploma has a gpa below 1,btohqsg
no...my diploma had 2 student below a gpa of 1,btohqsg
im friends with two that are also high scorers...one is 3.6 the other 3.8,btohqsg
jk i think u slap him he no damage one,btohqsg
in rp..the 3.8 is in the same class as the 1.4,btohqsg
im staying outta this for my sake HAHAHHA,btohqsg

cedric..honestly knowing you want a course in rp...ngl ite waste of time in that caseIm a y2 in rp  i know how the system here works...You just have to keep in mind  hardwork wont be rewarded here,btohqsg
nahhh i won't divorce her i would fuck her,btohqsg
so I have to work smart?,btohqsg
skill issue cannot affect accidentally spilling cup,btohqsg
revenge for my suffering 2 yearspleasure on bed for 2 minutes,btohqsg
rp's grading system enables a 1.47 to become a 3.0 in one semesterand vice versa,btohqsg
cuz siyan is reminding me that i woke up at 5pm instead of 12pm and we ended up playing night bowling instead of aftnn bowling,btohqsg
but yes essentially work smart..because the grading system in rp is not regulated,btohqsg
So this also means Rp has a bellcurve for most of its modules,btohqsg
that is why i can get a B grade for a quiz that i scored 7/24 on,btohqsg
and why i also can get a B grade for not submitting completed work,btohqsg
cause i failed my major exams,btohqsg
i couldnt submit but my sch auto submitted without updating me zz,btohqsg
depends on the module...its either daily grade   msa  Ese 20/20/40  60/25/35 and many more diff combinations,btohqsg
i manifest 4.0 for u ez,btohqsg
i failed 3 msa's this sem alr,btohqsg

cuz some of my friends say just run only,btohqsg
like 6 min/km for 2 km,btohqsg
is roughly 3 months enough to improve stamina?,btohqsg
but the extra 2 months is big no no,btohqsg
no  to train  have to run like 3km every 2 days,btohqsg
everyday can but might be bit too much for ur body,btohqsg
fk i also need to train,btohqsg
for first few runs  subsequent ones try to do closer to 2.4 pace,btohqsg
how many days should i run per week?,btohqsg

Yes  vary your run training with both intervals and cadence,btohqsg
What are you planning to get?,btohqsg
Yeah  CG is considered slow where I am,btohqsg
i have 16% bf and 55%+ muscle mass,btohqsg
Everybody here doing IPPT to get that 100,btohqsg
i was 89kg when i entered and i managed to shave off 3 minutes,btohqsg
so at your weight  it is legit doable  can one  just train,btohqsg
Yeah  just have a mix of both cadence and interval,btohqsg
my platoon POP with 20+ people goldand we enlisted with only 2 gold,btohqsg
when there is money then gold,btohqsg
can one  3 months can one,btohqsg
how many times you planning to run a week?,btohqsg
Can one  just keep doing it,btohqsg
cuz my soccer friend set for me,btohqsg
here's a training plan you can follow2 slow easy runs (30min)1 long slow easy run (1 hour)1 speed intervals,btohqsg
Oh  you can already mentally endure the duration?,btohqsg
i only did intervals 3 times so far,btohqsg
i just started running this week only,btohqsg
i trust my soccer friend cuz he sub 10,btohqsg
Okay  all the best  it'll take time for now :),btohqsg
because his body can take the load and to run sub 10  is purely speed. To go from slow to sub 11  is mainly endurance (though it is good to do intervals or hill sprint too),btohqsg
You need to build the mental resilience to keep up during the 2.4km before you try to go for below 2 minutes per 400m,btohqsg
Yeah  that will get you to 12 minutes for 2.4km,btohqsg
"the mental game damnnn gay bro. Especially at the semi circle  as i run the curve part  i can see how far the starting line is and im like ""wth i run so much only halfway""",btohqsg
i think 13 mins seems more possible for me,btohqsg
just train long runs and intervals like what IH said man  you will see results,btohqsg
Just build the mental endurance first :),btohqsg
my entire platoon of 40 people  all ran sub 12 by POP,btohqsg
tmr i try a long run,btohqsg
and by long run i mean 2km,btohqsg
and if a fat guy at 89kg like me can go from 14+ to 10+ within 3 months  you can also,btohqsg
I nvr even take ippt before,btohqsg
cuz i am actually a fat fk,btohqsg
do 4km but as slow as you need  even 8:00 min pace,btohqsg
if you have a heart rate monitor  keep it to zone 2-3  or max 150-160bpm,btohqsg
Or 5km at 6:30 ah but that can be the next level for you:),btohqsg
It's okay  I've been there before too,btohqsg
that's my current 30min easy run üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
That's always the best starting place ah,btohqsg
i find it helpful to run according to time rather than distance,btohqsg
Below 2 and you're definitely trying for Silver and above,btohqsg
i didn't touch cardio seriously in like years,btohqsg
A mixture of every training style actually helps a lot,btohqsg
nowadays i do 2 easy 30-45min run  1 speed intervals ( 6 x 600 ) and 1 long 15km run,btohqsg
I remember writing down the avg timings you need for the respective awards,btohqsg
i was more concerned about statics because i didn't want to be so stressed about the run LOL,btohqsg
This is true ah since the run times only matter if you cannot max out statics,btohqsg

any reco to cover balding spots,btohqsg
how is that gonna help hair scalp,btohqsg
it is well known for hair transplant/ hair related industries,btohqsg
i wish you all the best at saving up to visit turkey,btohqsg
i dont know what it is,btohqsg
depends on the type of balding you haveDermatologist will find out the actual reasoning.The most common solution without visiting one however is using minoxidil  Its a aliment that thickens hair strands and prolong the growth of hair.https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/374/Topical-Minoxidil,btohqsg
Hair in a can works by attaching positively fabricated hair strands to a negatively charged surface like a natural human hair.Because of this reasoning  hair in a can wont be effective on bald spots as they are void of negatively charged hair strands to stick on.,btohqsg
is it possible that health illness can lead to balding ? cause i battle w long term illness since sec 1,btohqsg
if it implicates your intake of iron or Vitamin D. But still visit a dermatologist if you have a longterm illness.If you have yet to use Minoxidil  then try it. If you have and the balding still persist. It could be one of the many factors mentioned above^,btohqsg
