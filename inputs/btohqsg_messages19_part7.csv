Why there's almost 2 years between completion date and delivery possession date? It's like a bit deceiving when we see the waiting time from HDB!,btohqsg
Delivery possession date is the way that HDB covers their ass  because beyond DPD they have to pay. The completion date is more likely  barring any issues,btohqsg
So basically they are giving themselves a room in case something goes wrong.,btohqsg
I wonder how badly these deadlines were affected because of COVID in2020-2021,btohqsg
know a few friends and family members have been waiting for their keys to tengah for almost about 3 plus years. so you can say its quite badly affected,btohqsg
Fair enough as long as we don't get the keys when we are already old with walking canes üòÅ,btohqsg
no compensation just try to speed up the construction. seen some workers have been working tirelessly in all kinds of conditions‚Ä¶,btohqsg
When is the SBF launch coming,btohqsg
Usually they're in May and Nov launches.Edit: the next SBF has been pushed back and will be in 2024,btohqsg
I also shock u took so long to let us know ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
anyone knows the application rate for the recent Oct 2023 rail-green project for 4 rooms?,btohqsg

Hi  if my partner owns a condo and I buy an hdb under singles scheme and we marry will hdb require her to sell the condo?,btohqsg
Above 35. Do I get to decide whether she can be either? We're not fussed about it,btohqsg
I think you can try writing into HDB to clarify,btohqsg
Or you can put her as occupier.,btohqsg
Hi all  let's say I buy bto  and get hdb loan  5 years later the bto completed construction I go collect key  must I still working the same job in order to get my loan and grant? What if in during this 5 years I change job or lose my job?,btohqsg
Hi guys! I‚Äôm seeking for some advice from everyone! Does the applicant‚Äôs order make a difference for the HFE PRELIM CHECK? Or is it better to have a eg: higher salary  to be placed as 1st applicant? Thankyou!,btohqsg
Can change ah. U in-between change job no problem.,btohqsg
No diff  they look at combine,btohqsg
If not enough money and don't want take loan or cannot take loan  then cannot apply bto? Cannot tell them by the time 5 years collect key I will have enough money?,btohqsg
Grant will be disbursed to you between flat selection appt and signing of lease agreement appt actually  it won't be when you collect keys,btohqsg
So grant will be based on your salary the period of 12 months before your BTO application,btohqsg
And final loan will be based on your income nearing key collection,btohqsg
They will let you apply right now anyway even if you technically don't have enough currently  as that would be unfair to judge your ability to fund a flat 5 years ahead of you actually starting to pay for the flat.if you dont have enough loan at the point of key collection  then you will have to pay the remainder in cash at the point of key collection,btohqsg
Does HFE letter application needs to provide bank statement? Thankyou in advance!,btohqsg
actually no need. just provide your 12mth salary & cpf statement.,btohqsg

Hello can I ask  if I apply BTO and add family members as occupier  does my occupier allow to apply BTO in near future before my BTO successful key collection or my occupier must meet the 5 years stay rules before could apply BTO?,btohqsg
In the event my occupier wants to apply BTO with the partner in near future  does my occupier allow to apply BTO as I may not yet collected BTO keys or not yet meet 5 years stay,btohqsg
if he/she is an essential occupier  you need HDB to remove his/her name first before he/she can apply for BTO,btohqsg
OR you can apply BTO  and then during the page where the requirement dont meet  just indicate accordingly.They will then ask u to submit an appeal.If dont succeed  u waste $10.If succeed  u got ur chance.,btohqsg
