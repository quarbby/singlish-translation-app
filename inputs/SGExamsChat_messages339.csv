Hi guys I hv a question to ask about leaps 2.0. For this  does this mean that even if I switched CCA  but still have at least 75% in both  I can get level 3 for participation?? Because my teacher only gave me level 2,btohqsg
iirc must be the same throughout your 4 years,btohqsg
if u switch then u cant,btohqsg
U nid to stay in ur CCA for 4 years straight,btohqsg
Huh but I thought it nvr say same,btohqsg
If not how u get 4 years straight if u change xD,btohqsg
Huh but like other boxes it got say same but this nvr,btohqsg
This would be level 4 already,btohqsg
I send you whole table can you help me check?,btohqsg
Bcos right my tcher only gave me level 2 for participation and leadership when I feel I should get level 3 for both( since I hit the requirement),btohqsg
Am I right to interpret it as any cca as long as 75% each year?,btohqsg
"U got hit the criteria of  ""demonstrating.... contribution""?",btohqsg
I participated in SYF and one other event,btohqsg
and also I’m in the exco,btohqsg

Every year I attained at least 75%,btohqsg
But I was jst in different ccas,btohqsg
As far as I rmb from my batch. U nid to be in same CCA,btohqsg
Ohh I thought that would be under level 4 already,btohqsg
U might wanna check with Ur Cher why l2  nia,btohqsg
Actually for mine was a different case. I only took 2 years in my previous cca and switch to another cca because they are closing down my previous cca.,btohqsg
^but that was cus they closed down.,btohqsg
My examiners tired coz I was the last candidate  got a distinction in the end lol,btohqsg

Vectors JC was my 13th reason😭,btohqsg
i guess you can focus on ensuring you know the non-CLT first then after you get those done then focus on CLT just in case? tbh CLTs are generally still tied in with non-CLTs (back when we had CLT that was not tested) so i guess to be safe just study but no need mug on it first,btohqsg
