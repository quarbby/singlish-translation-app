Was asking more along the lines of who are the people that started sgexams,btohqsg
it's... a complicated story.it started from students discussing exam stuff on the Singapore subreddit. then the Singapore subreddit mods got tired of the kids  then created the SGExams subreddit and kicked us there.from there our founder thought that there was something more that could come out of the subreddit  so he brought in more ppl  and the rest is history,btohqsg
our founder now not that active due to other commitments  but he took steps to ensure that the team can still function with him being less active,btohqsg
