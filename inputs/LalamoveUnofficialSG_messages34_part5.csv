when i'm on the way to pick up or when i reach the pick up point,btohqsg
The instructions said do not call leh,btohqsg
Some order mention do not call for confirmation. Like oddle eats.,btohqsg
When u proceeding to the pick up point,btohqsg
so basically is when im reaching ? or just when i'm On my way?,btohqsg
but is there a timing like 30 min need reach to pick up point and drop off point,btohqsg
There is a time completion shown on the job.,btohqsg
You can still inform cs the next day and ask them to claw for the 50% compensationWhen those morons laugh you can jus tell them abt the compensationGuarantee their laughter tio stuck halfway,btohqsg
I dont know abt the training notes now but last time it was stated u have 20min from time u accept to reach pickup point,btohqsg
I hope it’s just temporary loss leader to gain market share. Seriously  petrol prices go up. Self-employed drivers don’t have group insurance or dental plans etc. No 14-day annual leave. No MC  cos when you’re sick you are losing money (how to cover??) And all these companies are just pushing for lower delivery fees etc. Just so that consumers at home can have their burger or pizza or noodles just that little bit cheaper. Have a heart you bloodsuckers.,btohqsg
I did. I’ve been communicating with CS. They tell me they need customer (StarTaster) to agree to compensate me. Cos “it’s customer’s wallet”,btohqsg
So CS will respect the sanctity of customers’ wallets. Need their agreement before deduction. But when drivers cancel etc  will kena a $4 penalty. Will they seek drivers’ agreement first before deduct the $4?? End up driver become lampakia. Zzz,btohqsg
Yup i saw an article recently abt how these platforms are turning everything into a price war. Not only the riders suffer  the merchants are getting sucked by them also,btohqsg
Asia Times: Big Tech food delivery services are eating your lunch.https://asiatimes.com/2021/03/big-tech-food-delivery-services-are-eating-your-lunch/,btohqsg
Apparently the merchants are often bonded to a whole list of terms and restrictions just to get listed on the platforms  and many have no choice becos of covid,btohqsg
They take abt 20% from us  and 30-40% from merchants,btohqsg
Only for end to end systems like GF FP and deliveroo. For LLM merchants aren’t charged any fee. But merchants have to set up their own ordering system.,btohqsg
"Yes yes i mean ""those platforms"" in generalLike how some time last year one guy ""exposed"" the high commission grabfood takes from restaurants lol",btohqsg
let say i have already pick up the item from pick up point   it will next appear 'proceeding til drop off point',btohqsg
shuld i swipe tat when i otw to drop off point,btohqsg
or when i reach and delivered,btohqsg
Just swipe when u reach the place,btohqsg
After u take picture   confirm loading,btohqsg
Can do the rest when u reach the delivery location,btohqsg
Unless u r super late then once u reach swipe “reach drop off point” first then unload when u delivered,btohqsg
Wish u all safe on the road. Ride or drive safe,btohqsg
