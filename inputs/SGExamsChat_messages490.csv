Valo indeed a lot of girls‚Ä¶that don‚Äôt talk,btohqsg
Idk but I‚Äôm guessing  bro want to like interact with said girl,btohqsg
Redditors are people that you don‚Äôt wanna mess with‚Ä¶They are the people who found out the badge lady was a ex-RSN officer and the mrt lady was from Hwa Chong,btohqsg
But same kind of people on both platforms,btohqsg
The last hardwarezone shit I‚Äôve seen was on buses üòÇ,btohqsg
Girl was the captain of a rsn mine laying vessel,btohqsg
Also if I‚Äôm not wrong  before she retired‚Ä¶she was among the first batch of female navy pilots,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall heard of the missing/lost navy ship from sg?,btohqsg
At this point I already lost track of how many landing ships we have,btohqsg
I wonder how diff it must be to be assigned to a landing ship,btohqsg
Oh I know where all the landing ships went,btohqsg
They were repurposed as floating sea barricades for Changi naval base,btohqsg
However the new class of landing ships are coded ‚ÄúL07‚Äù and onwards‚Ä¶this means  there was a L06. Given to RSS Perseverance but‚Ä¶this is the ship that was lost/missing,btohqsg
Lol I would consider but I'm not in SG,btohqsg
Last time I just lurking for notes,btohqsg
Reddit is a lot less unsupervised,btohqsg
now OF is more like dilute stage,btohqsg
most ppl will have such acc,btohqsg
I mean there ‚Äòs ethical ways to make money,btohqsg
or u get tied to a string of commitment thereafter,btohqsg
these days ppl have realized a lot of things,btohqsg
it shld be gold to gold,btohqsg
such ppl are hard to come by,btohqsg
R woke up tday and decided to spit facts,btohqsg
"""I can fix her/him"" is the biggest trap",btohqsg
That moment you realise‚Ä¶these are the kind of services only the rich have excess too,btohqsg
Ever wonder why ppl leave their car when they crash?,btohqsg
Another reason is to avoid being caught drunk driving,btohqsg
You can just return the next day and say someone else drove it and crash the car‚Ä¶I‚Äôve heard cases where family members get paid to coverup a politician or something,btohqsg
The police don‚Äôt have the evidence to claim you were drink driving if you leave the scene and sober up then return like 12hrs later or something,btohqsg
Btw do y‚Äôall think onlyfans is the fastest way to get rich?,btohqsg
Just git gud and be born into it,btohqsg
Actually no leh depends on what career u go,btohqsg
Tbh if u chio or handsome u living life easy mode liao,btohqsg
Although some might argue that people only want u for your looks,btohqsg
That is something you cant deny,btohqsg
But i would say fastest way to get rich can be gambling,btohqsg
That moment you realise 70 percent of a mobile game‚Äôs cost goes to ads for the game,btohqsg
Another way is just hacking in games,btohqsg
Rmb ppl still buy in game items with real money,btohqsg
Might as well be that banker that withdraw one cent from all the bank‚Äôs account,btohqsg
Mobile games used to be good,btohqsg
Now they are just carbon copies of each other,btohqsg
Yup that is why I‚Äôm talking bout mobile games,btohqsg
You know there is something a super attractive person will never get to experience?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs called the meaning of life,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt even need the meaning of life being attractive do they?,btohqsg
I'm new here and I have a question how long does it take for RP's Enrolment information to arrive?,btohqsg
Nah I was trying to think of another word but could not find it,btohqsg
EH MY FRIEND GOING TPY TONIGIHT ALSO,btohqsg
Eh shit only 5 min walk from my house,btohqsg
6 only but i fucked my right shoulder up recently,btohqsg
Cutting incrreases pullups faster than gymming,btohqsg
idk why when people become rich...the first thing they dont go out to find is on how to get a lifetime supply of anything,btohqsg
i read somewhere that every former US president have lifetime security,btohqsg
cause i was thinking...what if you are no longer rich...at least you have a lifetime supply of something? right,btohqsg
like you are rich  buy a plane ticket...that ticket allows you to fly on any airline for the rest of your life,btohqsg
And why wld i no longer be rich,btohqsg
so even if you become poor...you still got that invaluable airline ticket,btohqsg
The amt of money used to buy the lifetime supply of smth cld be better used in times where we become poor,btohqsg
alot of reasons can result in that,btohqsg
If ur poor wld u rather a lifetime supply of plane ticketsOr money that cld be better used,btohqsg
bruh if i spin this narattive..i could say the same for branded goods,btohqsg
But no one buys a lifetime supply of branded goods,btohqsg
i mean you can buy the whole company,btohqsg
depending on how rich you are,btohqsg
but then there will be no point...,btohqsg
The point is that if u suddenly become poorA lifetime supply of smth is not as worth as the huge sum of money u paid for that,btohqsg
when i mention the airline ticket...it was like 250k,btohqsg
Uhhuh so if u suddenly poor udw 250k? GAHA gimme bro i want,btohqsg
when you think about it..before you become poor. would you not spend that 250k on something else,btohqsg
i beg to differ honestly...cause there are certain things that are definitely worth,btohqsg
I wld spend on what i want in the presentNot spend on a lifetime supple of smth,btohqsg
bruh y‚Äôall confused the fuck outta me LOL,btohqsg
i wonder if this is the entrepeneur mindset,btohqsg
btw guys..do you think h&m will close their stores very soon,btohqsg
yea...they are closing stores in already solid countries and reopening them in new terrirotiries,btohqsg
"welcome to something people like to call ""Survival of the fittest""",btohqsg
im surprise nobody has rivaled toy r us yet,btohqsg
like i cant see a main competitor to toy r us in singapore at least,btohqsg
kiddy palace is a contender but their toys to me not as vast across age groups,btohqsg
meanwhile they basically closed north american operations,btohqsg
that side alr gt Amazon India & Flipkart,btohqsg
btw this is a amazon delivery truck,btohqsg
this will be gd for the narrow streets in India,btohqsg
I mean i can buy one month of your onlyfans den cancel,btohqsg
If child labour is what it takes for me to get patagonia shirts for 15 bucks,btohqsg
It is what it is then,btohqsg
The way only fans run is not sustainable,btohqsg
or the site gets hacked by hackers,btohqsg
that threaten to release acc details like ashleymadison,btohqsg
Or u getting leaks for free,btohqsg
i still cant believe nobody has created a app to target the audience of ashleymadison,btohqsg
idk if the target audience is still the same after the leaks  cause ashleymadison is up again,btohqsg
but if its not...tinder is lierally the next closest thing,btohqsg
btw..if yall did not know. AshleyMadison was a dating app that allowed people who were already married to have a affair with other married people,btohqsg
The world is a fked up place,btohqsg
secretly...but then hackers hacked the app  stole the accs info of over 1million users and threaten the creators of the app to shut down the app or they will leak all the personal info.,btohqsg
they stole over 25 gigabytes of data,btohqsg
U know china got this api that can track if your gf appeared on leaks before,btohqsg
And got shut down coz girls feel violated or smth,btohqsg
the owners did not adhere and the hackers exposed all the details online..of over 36 million accs and all the info's,btohqsg
They like to flim themselves fking,btohqsg
Apparently the guys there like ah,btohqsg
the most intresting part about all this...is the app is still active,btohqsg
that is a kink if i ever heard one,btohqsg
Like every girl that the guy fk is a win,btohqsg
wait until they created a app where...every person you fuck  you get added to a leaderboard,btohqsg
then at the end of the month...the person at the top of the leaderboard gets something pricey like a car,btohqsg
I think there is a app for fleshlight that records how long u use it,btohqsg
Den can share your duration all,btohqsg
basically like a lucky draw app,btohqsg
but to enter you must fuck someone,btohqsg
that sounds like something a kid would manipulate it,btohqsg
...these kind of apps confirm got bots gonna take over the leaderboards. ppl will always find a way to get bots into these leaderboards no matter what it is for,btohqsg
nvm..TLDR: What if there was a app created that tracked something somebody does and add it to a leaderboard...the person at the top get a special prize at the end of a month,btohqsg
i have an important question to ask,btohqsg
when was the last time you spoke to a woman?,btohqsg
U cant hack into strava tho,btohqsg

since when is education in sh free,btohqsg
cause poly has no age (if you want to pay fully for the courses),btohqsg
its heavily subsidised if you are still in the education route,btohqsg
yea..ok. i see you are very technical with your thinking,btohqsg
Does zheng spend all his time going around messaging ppl lol,btohqsg
he has yet to msg me,btohqsg
i never said i was tbh...looking at how difficult it was to me to just point out a simple idea earlier,btohqsg
then after ns do degree then masters then phd,btohqsg

bro took a gap year somewhere,btohqsg
i hve btr things to do than to beat arnd the bush,btohqsg
im guessing you are saying you are too matured to be beating around the bush,btohqsg
and then work and hve a repetitive life for the next 5 yrs then get diagnosed wif depression and kill themselves,btohqsg
at the very least...my mindset is not all doom and gloom,btohqsg
Theres always a chill job for,btohqsg
Like 15 hour work week for 4k/myh,btohqsg
You can choose work life balance,btohqsg
ofc the work side more pay,btohqsg
yh then gets depressed and kill themslves but failed suicide and have to pay hospital bills. x2 depression,btohqsg
true but must choose the correct country,btohqsg
cuz some the cost of living expesnive asl,btohqsg
that momment you realise sg got nearly 6.8 million people..but one mental hospital fit to only carry about 3000 patients,btohqsg

Retake the old one  might be better. Not many competition from current JC students,btohqsg
Old one has less time (15mins less per paper)  seems to be more Singapore oriented compared to new syllabus. Some other differences I recall-old one includes first and second degree price discrimination while new one only has 3rd degree-new one has cognitive bias while old one doesn‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Yeah  old one maybe only MI year 3 would be taking this year (but I might be wrong as I‚Äôm not from there so not very sure),btohqsg
Huh so next year they still taking 9757?,btohqsg
