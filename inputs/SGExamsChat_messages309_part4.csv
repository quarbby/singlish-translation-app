Nah it wasnt just saying out to help,btohqsg
Really only got time for one person.,btohqsg
Will look at ur essay and mark and give some comments thats all,btohqsg
Doing cuz why not for the winter break. And i need a break from coding stuff.,btohqsg
Really if u r struggling with GP just hit me up. I can share what is the typical difference between an A/B and a fail essay,btohqsg
Tbh for GP is you ATQ you will get C. Except for some schools that are more demanding,btohqsg

Uncle think Unsupported User is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Hi guyss anyone know of any jc tuition that costs max $45 per hr?,btohqsg
Group tuition or get those undergrads for 1 to 1,btohqsg
If I go poly  can I wear super childish dress like white blouse white skirt everyday?,btohqsg
tbh no one rly cares abt what u wear hor HAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
most of us lazy to dress up also  unless we gg out aft class or sth,btohqsg
There's no dress code policy like sec right,btohqsg
but as much as poss try to look decent,btohqsg
Yeah  except if you have to go to science laboratory room then need to wear long pants and covered shoes,btohqsg
Can wear anything you want. You can also attend lecture theatre classes in slippers. Just don’t come in swim wear can alr.,btohqsg
Technically can  but not really recommended if you have to go to science laboratory room as it might not be able to cover up your entire legs (even if can cover up your entire legs  what happens if you fall down in the laboratory while you're holding very concentrated chemicals?)Ignore this message if you're planning to take non-science courses,btohqsg
But generally just wear any outfit that makes you comfortable,btohqsg
Not sure what's the hype behind white socks and crocs,btohqsg
I think crocs has *sports mode*,btohqsg
i wore uniqlo grey shirt gray pants everyday for half a year straight,btohqsg
Billionaires also dress the same daily,btohqsg
Oh I seeSo  you have to wear long pants if you're going to science laboratory roomJust now I mentioned what if you fall down  this one I meant like if you accidentally step on your skirt and trip  you might hurt others too  especially if you're carrying very highly concentrated chemicals,btohqsg
So  yeahExcept for going to science laboratory room  nobody will care if you want to wear shirt  shorts and slippers in general,btohqsg
Can look for undergrads though for majority of the cases  I won't recommend. I have taken enough students to see the effectiveness  or lack thereof.You probably will get better quality help in the A level telegram chat group  though it's subjected to time and energy availability of the qualified people that volunteered their time there.Word of advice. Don't forget last two years of A level grads graduated without common last topic tested.,btohqsg
Yo guys can yall reccomend some good assessment books ?,btohqsg
The best assessment books there is,btohqsg
