There will probably still be some due to mechanical wear and tear but best we can do is to try to minimise them,btohqsg
Wear n tear is normal bopian need change one. But just need to know where to change. Dk how some ppl drive until the part suppose to wear out at 100k they 80k wear out alr (just a figurative example),btohqsg
Sometimes it is down to that,btohqsg
Wa thanks fr replying him sia can catch up on the lost messages,btohqsg

That's true but it's honestly not that difficult. While you shop in a mall in 2h can recharge about 100km mileage. Also 'full tank' costs $30. Based on personal exp,btohqsg
Ur assumption is the chargers arent taken up. But like I said  we r not ready yet considering bulk of us live in HDBs with no access to EV charging.,btohqsg
Nothing feels better than smell of carbon monoxide when you start the car after a while,btohqsg
