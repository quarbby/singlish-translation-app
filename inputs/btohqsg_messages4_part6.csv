thks!If we are unable sell the existing HDB within 6 months of getting the 2nd new HDB will we be charged the ABSD?How much will be the ABSD  if any?,btohqsg
Absd means buy private property liao is it,btohqsg
I mean absd always relate to private property isn't it,btohqsg
How Do You Calculate ABSD?For instance  say if a property is valued at $1 million but the selling price is $1.1 million. Assuming that you're subjected to 12% ABSD  the ABSD amount that you'll need to pay is $1.1 million X 12% = $132 000.Who Needs to Pay ABSD?ABSD applies to the following group of buyers:Singapore Citizens: ABSD will be levied on the second (12%) and subsequent property purchasesSingapore Permanent Residents (PRs): ABSD will be levied on all purchases. The first purchase will be 5% while second and subsequent purchases will be 15%Foreigners: 20% ABSD for any property purchaseEntities (companies or associations): 25% for each property,btohqsg
hi all! quite new to the BTO scene. for e.g. boon lay glade  how long before date of completion will they open up Sale of Balance Flats?,btohqsg
Not by date of completion.. HDB will only release units after all ppl with a queue no for the bto selected a unit.for example Feb 2021 bto will not be released for May 2021 as selections are still ongoing.Leftover flats will go to sale balance flat.if there are leftover of sales of balance flats it will go to open booking(including those unit given up),btohqsg
