Thats 3 months wages to them,btohqsg
i wish i can pay my car with 3 months pay,btohqsg
Was thinking the same. There‚Äôs storage facilities in JB and KL for approx $300 a month with mechanic and car wash included monthly,btohqsg
Considering how much we spend here in sg‚Ä¶ the $300 I take it as CBD season parking üòÖ,btohqsg
haha but its not guaranteed the car won't get lost,btohqsg
Apparently it‚Äôs a warehouse facility but no idea,btohqsg
Saw a few for supercars but that one‚Ä¶ a bit overkill if I just wna keep a Satria neo there üòÇ,btohqsg
"the moment the government did a search on these ""offroad"" cars  his eg6 also magically disappeared",btohqsg

The car is dead weight now hahahahah,btohqsg
Changed batt but cannot seem to start at all hahah,btohqsg
can be a fun diy project,btohqsg
He wanted it to be a track car haha,btohqsg
Honestly not a bad idea. We don‚Äôt really need cars in sg,btohqsg
i like the idea we drive our nice car over  then play with the track car there.  So anything happens to it  not as painful,btohqsg
but if its an offroad car  you need to tow,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt have very strict rules on inspection I think,btohqsg
Yes can. But u cannot drive it to sg,btohqsg
so the solution is to find a malaysia girl lol,btohqsg
My friend gets his Malaysian relatives,btohqsg
To drive the car into sg,btohqsg
Just don‚Äôt suay get stopped to check license üòÖ,btohqsg
No one can help you there,btohqsg
its a good budget solution to have a track car,btohqsg
Ur rim like more towards rally kind ah,btohqsg
Hard to find this airbag cover lol,btohqsg
Yea mine stock 18 already after chg rim can see damn small the disc,btohqsg
offset meaning like it protrudes out more,btohqsg
Slowly. I one month get one item,btohqsg
Slowly. I try one shot. Wa eat grass,btohqsg
yours i think the offset quite ok right,btohqsg
Put spacer someone say inspection fail,btohqsg
Spacer when u go fast I feel weird. Or maybe just my car,btohqsg
but how to calculate the correct offset that one i don't know,btohqsg
Mine for now okay la just nice,btohqsg
That time i google then they talk,btohqsg
Must see the 37j or 42j,btohqsg
Then depends on ur rim whether deep dish,btohqsg
best is ask same car owners what their offset is,btohqsg
