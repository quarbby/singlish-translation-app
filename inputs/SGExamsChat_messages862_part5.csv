Computing Science Total Fee â€”> $173 x 180 = $31 140Let's say you are eligible for higher education community bursary  where you get a subsidy of $5 100 per year.$5 100 x 3 = $15 300$31 140 - $15 300 = $15 840If you managed to apply for a private bursary  say it gives you $5 000 per year.$5 000 x 3 = $15 000$15 840 - $15 000 = $840Balance out of pocket is like $840,btohqsg
Any1 sign up for sentinel program before,btohqsg
Calculation for IS/SE course. (Course is actually 3 years and 2 semesters  but community bursary is dispersed per semester  thus the calculation of 3 2/3)This is based on the assumption you get both community bursary and private bursary. Community bursary is 100% can get  private bursary will depend.Per my calculation at least  you dont even pay a single cent in terms of school fees. In fact you have a negative balance at the end of $8 100,btohqsg
Just started uni and already feeling like a failure  idk why but it feels so overwhelming and stressful and I just wanna cry,btohqsg

i mean the pressure is normal  but if it's that bad  probs good to take a step back and understand where it stems from,btohqsg

H2 Mathematics â€“ Use of Graphing Calculators to Deal with Probability Distributions [TI-84 Plus CE]-5.pdf,btohqsg
I'd appreciate more feedback   features suggestions or comments to this document I written so far .... I have 2 h2 math books for stats and I realised that individual books alone isn't showing complete pictures on gc capabilities,btohqsg
It took some major digging effort into both books for me to realise the fact that the other book isn't a complete guide ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Wahhh being Singaporean so nice. Tuition fees heavily discounted.,btohqsg
For Malaysian if you finished poly  can try apply for PR before you enrol into uni,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think PR that easily get for youngsters,btohqsg
Unless already aim for ASEAN Scholarships and convert since Primary 6,btohqsg
My cousin gotten in since Sec3 as ASEAN Scholar didnâ€™t even manage to get tuition rebates. Singapore MOE sponsor him until A Levels. ðŸ˜‚ maybe he enroll into dentistry thatâ€™s the problem,btohqsg

Random idea: why not rent a chalet as a filmmaking set?,btohqsg
Are you going for the secondary  JC or Poly route ?,btohqsg
Jc is 1 year   Poly is 2 years and secondary should be 4 years . Each of them have different things that they will teach .,btohqsg
Well...2 yrs assuming you nvr retook uh,btohqsg
It's normal  and such feelings will happen sooner or later in life. There are always curveballs being thrown at us at some point.Just know that you are already a winner to have come so far. And you will be still be successful in the future.The feeling of stress and being overwhelmed is only temporary. It's like a rites of passage to the next higher level you.,btohqsg
No No I mean in the sentinel program if you're in Poly   then the program is 2 years. If you're in JC   its 1 year,btohqsg
Ah OK then most likely it's a condensed version of the poly one.(This is if they did not change much)There will be a few modules which comprises of python programing   cyber security networking which uses wireshark. Additionally   there will be CTFs competition for you to earn prizes. Personally  I think its a good experiences for portfolio and you can have a chance for work attachments with DIS and other agencies.,btohqsg
There will be classes during the holidays which can last up to a week so you need to scrarific your hols,btohqsg
Hmm.. they changed the JC schedule to 2 years .,btohqsg
I have to admit I didn't read the website or read the chat upwards  I just googled for fun based on the program name,btohqsg
At least backed by smth kinda credible,btohqsg
Idk maybe the website has a mistake or 2 oh well,btohqsg
just wait until working  you be more stressful and start doubting your meaning of living.Anyhow  got things to do when young  try to write down a bucket list.Reflect and Reset your priorities  after you struck an amount of savings  and migrate and change a field to something that makes you truly happy.,btohqsg
Actually there was a proposal for poly to shorten to 2 years but it went no where ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I heard of it during a counselling session in school on academic advice matters,btohqsg
as long it saves on tuition fees  and faster deployment of diploma graduates into industry,btohqsg
because 80% of the time  what you studied  won't be applicable to what your company wants you to do lol,btohqsg
For Asian countries  we too glorified of certs until we lose meaning of them ...,btohqsg
go to Western countries  it's might be more laid back  people not freaking out on not having a college degree and burden by tuition debt.,btohqsg
but their cost of currency higher than usðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Usa also laid back..but it's usdðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Well   USA known for expensive university education ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Their university has like useless degree major courses as well ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Some say is like a scam,btohqsg
Eg. Food science ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ is better than sg..so guess its better to stay in usa? But sg ppl also cannot get employed unless they married usa citizen then can get job,btohqsg
Haha I guessing under Trump  it might get tougher uh,btohqsg
If anyone going usa to study  watch this prior to going there,btohqsg
this isn't a usa focused issue,btohqsg
just generally more common in western parts of the world,btohqsg
which you can link to how their society works,btohqsg
