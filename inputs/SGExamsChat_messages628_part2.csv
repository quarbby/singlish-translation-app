Asian parents:People work and earn $ from things that they don't likeSo that they can do and spend $ on passion.,btohqsg
Not all passion can feed you or a future family.,btohqsg
why now days sg got legit very disgusting cases,btohqsg
was it just yesterday got the brother do shit to his sister,btohqsg
this type can chop off kkj,btohqsg
the mother say and never report,btohqsg
the mother fking stupid and disgusting,btohqsg
thatâ€™s a punchline from an asian comedian too lol,btohqsg
but itâ€™s so true for us,btohqsg
ohh i see  yeah then its fine to be bare/empty at the start,btohqsg
What if everyone wanna work the high paying jobs won't it saturate the market and depress salaries,btohqsg
i mean thatâ€™s literally what always happens,btohqsg
look at how saturated CS is,btohqsg
Dude can I just say idk why this auntie beside me her fking bag keep poking me,btohqsg
But even if competition is steep there still will be alot of supply so they can offer less and there might still be someone working for slightly lower?esp from lower income countries?,btohqsg
Heard alot of companies also have ghost workers to hire more foreigners,btohqsg
And pay random people cpf to just get the local quota,btohqsg
actually i also want to point out paying the same salary required for one competent local engineer to outsource 3 india bodyshop engineers that aren't very competent can be a net negative thing despite saving cost  and many companies are realizing that now,btohqsg
Unless the outsourcing teams get better?,btohqsg
but ultimately pay peanuts get monkey  you pay them so little they will only do what is required without using their brain,btohqsg
they can get better ba but they won't really put in the effort given that they're paid peanuts  also one more important thing is now your outsourced worker has domain knowledge  in years to come they can use that as leverage,btohqsg
that domain knowledge they acquired isn't within your own company (i.e. internal knowledge)  which is also an issue,btohqsg
That's why sme mostly take like 3rd class honours/2nd lower?,btohqsg
cannot say like that la gpa not a main factor in determining how competent they are esp in techies,btohqsg
unless u wanna go gov sector,btohqsg
or one dude wear multi hat,btohqsg
My friend got 3rd class and flex he earn more than me .gg,btohqsg

Ncs and govtech need high gpa?,btohqsg
Got friend diploma get in as swe,btohqsg
its not compulsory but u need to realise most people applying already have high GPA + projects.,btohqsg
So then cut off probably 4.5 alr,btohqsg
no such thing hahaha as in no hard fast rule,btohqsg
Isn't there cutoff like for bulge bracket and MBB,btohqsg
not everywhere so clear cut one,btohqsg
gpa less important factor outside of garment  relevant internship + projects/portfolio is way more important ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Only BB MBB and govt care I guess?,btohqsg
