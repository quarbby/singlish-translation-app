Gg time to die next yr HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
If i dont get an A,btohqsg
I mean I'm not aiming for FCH la (esp with ddp) but like,btohqsg
"json web tokens  starts with json notation so ""{"" char but it's b64 encoded so it becomes ey",btohqsg
as long as it's second class I think is ok?,btohqsg
The average nus merit gets FCH,btohqsg
You become sensitive to such things when you do enough ctfs,btohqsg
can't be nus merit scholar means FCH what,btohqsg
Gpa is just a number guys,btohqsg
why do you have a circle of merit scholars,btohqsg
there's an exclusive scholar club meh,btohqsg
You need to increase your sample size and it has to be random,btohqsg
so good.. I also want school holiday tomorrow,btohqsg
75 percentile for A- kinda disgusting,btohqsg
So many times kena cucked alr cause missed by a little bit,btohqsg
Literally all my mods this year,btohqsg
I kinda let my guard down so oh well  careless mistakes ensued thereafter,btohqsg
Worse part is if NUS high students are taking ur module,btohqsg
They reduce the number of grades left for undergrads,btohqsg
they're graded on the same bell curve?,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense to separately grade anyway,btohqsg
I think still can clutch A-?,btohqsg
Cos impossible the same ppl 75th all tests,btohqsg
This mod i did last year,btohqsg
I was hoping for A- but bellcurve be like that,btohqsg
The grade cut off is determined by overall summation of each test's 75th,btohqsg
But as mentioned it doesnt make sense,btohqsg
But yeah also this? But generally the rlly good ppl should be consistent also,btohqsg
Rule of thumb is you count your own results if summation under 75th pct you go suck prof D maybe get A-,btohqsg
You v smart can one just consistent > 75 pct only ezclap,btohqsg
One of my finals most of the above 75th got rekted,btohqsg
I hope generally thats not the case,btohqsg
But generally is the case hehe,btohqsg
It's logical ma if you good you will do well lol,btohqsg
How many days do you have off,btohqsg
