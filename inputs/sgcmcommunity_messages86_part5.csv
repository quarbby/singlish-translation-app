Good morning all you handsome boys and gorgeous gals!,btohqsg
Morning all  if a p-plate car drives over to JB  better to remove the yellow triangle from the car or just leave it there still?,btohqsg
Not so nice numbers this morning,btohqsg
With the yellow triangle or without the lable on the car  that's the difference. 😂,btohqsg
I still them on even though it's not needed. Coz I still learning everyday as sometimes I missed the traffic sign...oops,btohqsg

Only that few talking as Always,btohqsg
Sorry. Put wrong emoji 🥹- E,btohqsg
And I thought I’m drunk… again!!! 😅😅,btohqsg
Here is ok lah. I'm referring to drive over to JB with the p-plate on.,btohqsg
No difference.. Dont think our bros up north will give chance if u have p plate on.,btohqsg
Wana go JB just go bah.. Dont worry too much. Best if u can get a friend to guide u along for ur first ride in.,btohqsg
eh i like that bike too,btohqsg
ya at least at JB however they don’t drive like dicks,btohqsg
unlike some Singaporean drivers that we see on a daily basis,btohqsg
so just drive defensive and you will do fine,btohqsg
I feel like at JB they’re crazier but they won’t kp if you drive like that too,btohqsg
Haa  instead I'm more worried to get bullied by 🚓 when they saw you are having a yellow triangle lable over there 😂,btohqsg
Wkwkwkw if they ask you pay kopi money,btohqsg
JB seems more forgiving. I see them giving way most of the time,btohqsg
Just say you’ll pay at the station,btohqsg
Sg drivers die die also won’t give way. You signal to show your intention to change lane and they make it their life goal to not let you through hahaha,btohqsg
Drive 80 at lane 1 thinking they king of the road,btohqsg
Highbeam and horn also still same,btohqsg
Usually I will overtake then drive even  slower infront of them,btohqsg
So early in the morning Ah?,btohqsg
Ya so far they always give way leh,btohqsg
malaysia u can signal right to overtake and people will gladly let u pass,btohqsg
Right! Okay I go take beer now.,btohqsg
Ego so big they can’t see what’s ahead,btohqsg
even singaporean cars in malaysia don’t like to give way,btohqsg
the car behind more powerful and going faster but want hog,btohqsg
can hear the cvt strain sia when they try chase back hahaha,btohqsg
wah suddenly so many scammers - J,btohqsg
Especially those Toyota inside is uncle,btohqsg
wah eh i once had a almera refuse to give way to me then try chase after overtake super irritating sia,btohqsg
It's more like they drive fast and are unpredictable at times but they know how to save themselves and not crash into anyone else,btohqsg
The issue is when a new Singaporean driver goes over and doesn't understand this driving style,btohqsg
They don't act entitled and will just give way if you're faster  but don't expect to overtake and then cruise at your speed. There's always someone faster who will come by,btohqsg
