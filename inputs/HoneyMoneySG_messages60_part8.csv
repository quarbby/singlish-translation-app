From there its straightforward. 1 letter is all you need,btohqsg
Edwin mentioned no pin.. only has card,btohqsg

cause i did call UOB CS they confirmed that need wait for another letter for pin but didnt say how long it will come  for me to completed my registration but i can use the card first no issue after activation,btohqsg
how do we know if we qualify for the bonus interest lol,btohqsg
On moomoo platform  how exactly do we check how much cash we have inside? They only list Total asset value  which is a nightmare to track when you have it in multiple currencies,btohqsg
Hi  may i ask  for uob one accountFor $500 spending can i use uob one debit card to do payment on axs (for singtel  sp etc)?,btohqsg
Investing in deposit with 1 percent interest rate per month.,btohqsg
You probably got to understand the risks.They are paying u 12% p.a. and lending out the same money to higher risk corporate customers (who probably got rejected by normal banks).Have to check if their corporate customers default  who takes the hit. YOU or the Company? And if it is the Company  how strong are they to be able to withstand the corporate defaults.,btohqsg
is the pic the exclusion list?,btohqsg
yeahit was a quick scan thru  i might be wrong,btohqsg

Can't remember if I have checked the smart park and CFD option upon account sign up. Is there any way to confirm?,btohqsg
Because your name is Aaron i will be more tolerating$3k per calender month cap for solitaire$1k per calender month cap for platinum,btohqsg
Not that Aaron but still a decent bloke. Just guessing nia 🤔 🤷‍♂️ But yea 6 mpd up till 3K,btohqsg
Smart park: check the video last part: online forms > excess funds authorization. CFD: should have a separate CFD account on top of normal account  or check with customer service,btohqsg
this is only for new moo2 acct holders?,btohqsg
top up CPF better  save for retirement 🙈,btohqsg

I'm using 2.0  Mobile 3 is the latest version,btohqsg

Thank you..seem like only way is to use miles card for tuition fees  at least we gain something 😅,btohqsg
Also  can we use EVOL to pay for Anytime Fitness and get any eligible cash back?,btohqsg
Is ntuc in app pay by app payment consider online payment for uob Evol? Anyone tried before?,btohqsg
Why not apply both   privi mile for sign up gift then get UOB EVOL if u plan to use it for $500 spend. (PRIVI miles dont qualify for spend criteria w account i think),btohqsg
Privi will just be for the first 2 month  then I’ll move to EVOL.. just for the one time first account sign up 😅,btohqsg
You got to weigh the choices though  I personally am not sure about EVOL's sign-up gift  but Im guessing u have some direction already given u only mention these two cards.And yesh  confirmed UOB One spend requirement excludes PRVI miles,btohqsg
Yeap. Planning to miss out on the savings % for the two moths  after that then change to EVOL..,btohqsg
