Hi group admin  able to pin this message? Thank u heh,btohqsg
Is there a number limit for applicant for each area?,btohqsg
Is there any kallang group for Jun 2024?,btohqsg
hello would like to ask if anyone knows this:If my fiance and I were to apply under the MCPS scheme and fulfils all the criterias for the MCPS. Once the balloting results is out  my  single-parent can move house if they plan to right?  or are they not allowed to?,btohqsg
Cannot move for the entirety of the MOP,btohqsg
so technically means if I am planning to apply the June BTO they cannot move for the next 15years? cause it includes the waiting time,btohqsg
hello  wanted to check if anyone knows the income ceiling for the jurong east june 2024 bto 3rm flat?,btohqsg
Income ceiling for all BTO flats for families should be $14K and below,btohqsg
If you're single  it's a different number,btohqsg
3rm would be different right? saw this in the Conditions for Purchasehttps://resources.homes.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp13/General_Conditions(Jun24).html,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if MCPS only applies to parents staying in HDB?,btohqsg
This time round Don‚Äôt seems to have balcony flats üòÇ,btohqsg
Sorry  admins aren't given the rights to. Only the owner can do it,btohqsg
Crazy. Starting 568k for 4 room.,btohqsg
So there might be chance there is SBF for the Oct launch ? Or open booking,btohqsg
Once per year. No more SBF for 2024,btohqsg
they can move but it has to be within 4km still  MCPS rule,btohqsg
yup i saw the recent update!,btohqsg
Ahahaha the price is abt the same as 2 room 99 years flexi for SBF May 2023 Queenstown without grants since it's a mature estate üòÇ,btohqsg
It's as good as getting resale 4 room alrd üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
How come Oct has so many? Usually like 4-6 projects only right,btohqsg
Oh yes I noticed too! example: AMK,btohqsg
I notice that bto lifts nowadays automatically stop at mid level e.g. entire block is 16 storeys and the lift idles and stops at 8 usually,btohqsg
I have a friend staying at Teban bto near the mosque there. 3 sets all can go low & high floor.,btohqsg
Honestly speaking it's better off to have 3 sets go low & high floor altogether. Much easier & less confusing as compare to 2 sets high 2 sets low üòÇ,btohqsg
Cannot move outside the 4km radius,btohqsg
hi! does anyone know when is next bto release after this june one?,btohqsg
My friend bought Dakota breeze bto in 2016 for about 600k . After MOP can resell >1m üòÑ,btohqsg
This 1 is different. Once u resell can gain almost 100% profits ;) For resale there isn‚Äôt much to profit ?,btohqsg
Not sure he didn‚Äôt tell me which floor,btohqsg
parents can move  but must still be within 4km of the launch,btohqsg
Depends lo. The next sales proceed need to pay for the next house unless that person wants to stay at the beach ehehe.But anyway some resale house around Tampines at that price need minimal to zero reno + no COV + within 1 year can move in. No need to wait for 3-4 years üôà,btohqsg
Since this is a BTO groupchat  I won't go into so much on resale.All the best to yall applying whichever estates you go for teehee ‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Application rates normally get refreshed on the daily?,btohqsg
Not sure if its a silly question  my queue number is a few numbers away from supply for feb launch. Am i able to apply for june launch? In case cant get?,btohqsg
Anyone have experience of discharge mortgage for bank loan?Is it compulsory to engage law firm to do it?How much does it cost?,btohqsg
If income drop they will reassess your income during flat selection ?,btohqsg
Declare to them or reapply HFE,btohqsg
If you get to flat selection and are unable to afford it  HDB will consider it as failure to select a unit. And will penalise accordingly.,btohqsg
Away from supply you mean a few numbers before the end of supply (ie still within supply) or after the end of supply (ie out of supply)?If within supply  cannot apply until after the flat booking appointment  at which point  you would be considered a 2nd timer for 1 year due to 1 non-selection count.If out of supply  can apply  BUT if you get called for the Feb launch and do not select  your Jun one will be cancelled anyway.Source:https://t.me/btohqsg/76931,btohqsg
Thank you for the useful information!,btohqsg
Btw guys  can I seek some help. I‚Äôm looking to apply for the Oct BTO. My partner will only hit the 1 year mark of working on 1 Nov as he started FT on 1 Nov last year. While I have just started FT this May  so if we apply the HFE  latest by Sep. Will we not be eligible to get the grants first? Or will the hdb deem it as eligible since by the time they process or release the result  it would at least be in Nov alr?,btohqsg
To add on  prior to working FT. I did technically work consecutively for more than 12 months of part time but not sure if that counts!,btohqsg
As HFE is relatively new  not many people might have experienced this yet  so I'll just share my experience.Note that my experience is under HLE  so a. It's anecdotal and b. It's HLE rather than HFE. All this to say  take this with a grain of saltI was the only one working  and at the point of application  i had only worked FT consecutively for 7 months.My grant application took a long time to process (1 year after flat selection  when most ppl were 6-9 months after flat selection)  but at the 1 year mark  they requested for further payslips (another 3 months) and then within a few weeks  they granted me grant (full according to the grants table)To fully answer your question  technically they go based on the point of application (ie now). But they /might/ ask for additional documentsTL;dr my experience was they allowed me with 7 out of 12 months FT work to get full grants,btohqsg
Must be 12 months. And they only take into account CPF contribution about 2 month before point of HFE application.,btohqsg
If you want the grant  that is.,btohqsg
Can call HDB for a clearer answer!,btohqsg
I tried but they didn‚Äôt pick up! Emailed them also just give abit vague ans hahaha,btohqsg
Regarding PT  if they allow you to submit income documents...I would just try to submit even the PT ones. Give them as much as you can  so they can assess accordingly.,btohqsg
I think you can also write into the e-feedback form and share your situation. Just try anything and hope for the best I feel,btohqsg
