1990 e30 m40  but i bouhgt it in 2004 becoming the 6th owner. it has 152000km then and i ran it to 600 000+ km today. this is a workhorse,btohqsg
but requires a lot of time and care.,btohqsg
coz u said you ALREADY won so they eliminated you,btohqsg
m40 is 316 right i confused that time u say m3 hahaha,btohqsg
yeah. i blast it to 6200 rpm all the time. it just loved it.,btohqsg
i had 316i and also m3,btohqsg
wah making the most outta the 100hp sia haha,btohqsg
the e30 is manual  light and enjoyable to drive. it feels just the same as the m3  just smaller power. the way it anchors the road  braking. all same,btohqsg
due to balance. and yes i drove this e30 to phuket in 2014,btohqsg
and it still has the same original exhaust  although the rubbers have worn out a few times due to wear and tear. the rubbers that used to support the exhaust,btohqsg
old stuff lasts long. very very long.,btohqsg
what colour is your e30 sir?  and which m3 do you have as your second bmw?  wah.. your life my dream.,btohqsg
good condition despite blasting to redline often,btohqsg
the more i do the better is fuel economy. the key is good quality engine oil and frequent change. oil must be hot before driving hard. of all the oils i tried  i like castrol edge 0w30,btohqsg
so  who says you cannot drive at5000-6000rpm? this is the power band and extremely exhilarating. the manual gearbox is very rewarding and fun changing gears at 5000+,btohqsg
dry plugs too. i almost dont change plugs. NGK pugs are super lasting,btohqsg
I am glad everything improved after you changed out the pistons and conrod. 👍👍,btohqsg
just showing you high revv driving does not destroy engine.,btohqsg
i do it in alfa bmws,btohqsg
later i changed steering to e46. this is the best feel. the original e30 steering is bad,btohqsg
where do you source the conrod and pistons for this e30?,btohqsg
No la where got like that one😆 There was only a slim 1/789 chance for our bro here to win the prize leh!,btohqsg
minus him then i will get 788 chances mah 🤣,btohqsg
Maybe you will win in our next giveaway👀,btohqsg
i did this rack conversion in JB. costs me rm350 for the rack,btohqsg
but the bmw rack is notorious for leaks. each and every one of them leaks oils,btohqsg
Conrods also very easy to bend. Pistons also need to change.,btohqsg
dont know where you got such belief! unless you suck in water,btohqsg
That is very rude Mr Teo,btohqsg
just because i drive at high revvsbut below redline conrods will bend?,btohqsg
then i am sure many M3s are made for rebuilt then,btohqsg
peopl;e buy M3s in order to drive hard and near redline. they are as durable as ever when taken good care  with regular oil change and good oils and good habits of not blasting engine under NO load,btohqsg
Disagreement with a person's opinion is alright,btohqsg
"But there is no need to say stuff like you suck in water and how do you believe such ""shit""",btohqsg
but it is true. if engine sucks in water then con rods can bend,btohqsg
what is wrong with you? you so fragile?,btohqsg
if you disagree  it is fine. but i am sharing my living experiences driving this. i have escaped floods a few times in malaysia.,btohqsg
but i have had cam belts changed twice because they are broken. this is the nasty thing that you must observe changing early.,btohqsg
"I believe@Cxspeedmeant ""unless the engine sucked in water"". He was missing a punctuation",btohqsg
yes i meant that and didnt i say that?,btohqsg
you sucked in water = your engine,btohqsg
Like final destination for the bus driver,btohqsg
how come he forgot to close door? he surely knew as it is noisy,btohqsg
Looks like Tesla's are not made from vibranium,btohqsg
this kind can be very hard to repair?,btohqsg
the top is sheared off the support broken,btohqsg
Especially because Tesla bodyshops are rare and take a long time in general,btohqsg
i am inclined to think he is trying to show off haha,btohqsg
well he paid the price for showing off then,btohqsg
london near knightsbridge has a lot of flashy sports cars exotic cars whatever showing off blasting exgaust loud. i remember seeing a lambo exhaust on fire spreading to the back driver didnt know,btohqsg
@Cxspeedwhere did you source for your conrods and pistons?,btohqsg
many say the interiro quality doesnt measure up  is it true?,btohqsg
Ya a lot of ppl think it needed a wide space,btohqsg
Problem is.. if it chomp the car beside u.. who is accountable? Tesla?,btohqsg
It like auto tailgate the impact little nia,btohqsg
Sienta auto door also nice esp if u carry alot stuffs,btohqsg
Yes she been raving about it when she sit her colleague car,btohqsg
Especially if wearing mini skirt so convenient,btohqsg
Look like at least 2m which some carparks will fail,btohqsg
Many cp cant clear e height,btohqsg
I am offered car insurance policies from both DirectAsia and Etiqa at NCD30. Eqtiqa is about $100 more expensive than DirectAsia  so I’m wondering if anyone could advise which I should go for. Thanks!,btohqsg
if both coverage same   i will pick the cheaper.,btohqsg
or if the cheaper one covers my needs.. i will still pick the cheaper.,btohqsg
Coverage more or less the same. Normally i just take the lowest quote by agent,btohqsg

It’s like they’re rushing toward something… 😂,btohqsg
Directasia quoted me 910 vs income 802,btohqsg
DA usually don't cover personal accident  medical expenses  24/7 road assistance  authorised driver and overseas emergency unless u opt in.check if DA quote is opt in those above and on par with TIQ.if so  take DA.,btohqsg
Or u wish give SGDriver Pte Ltd a try. They give me very good quote but too bad they revert abit slow so i renew with regular agent.,btohqsg
moneysmart or singsaver also can.otherwise  diy research... i have compared like 15 companies myself so my memory is still fresh. 😅,btohqsg

These cheaper insurance generally no agent to help you if need to claim. If you can find one with agent then it's ok,btohqsg
British pedigree  German technology. This two add up  doesn’t sound cheap.,btohqsg
You still have not told us where did you source for your conrods and pistons? D:,btohqsg
The Admin.. is watching … *whispers*,btohqsg
Automatic car  the gear shift is tight. Is it abnormal?,btohqsg
Morning folks. Is this pre departure form required for a drive into Malaysia?,btohqsg
its just malaysiaboleh nv update. just go only with passport and tng card,btohqsg
So no longer need vax record to proof alr?,btohqsg
no reason why they will ask cause they not only remove the app  the restriction to go places for unvax also removed.,btohqsg
sg removed tracetogether but if im not wrong.. by right stll need vax status to go restaurants blah blah,btohqsg
lol summon and demerit points.Only drivers with clean records can participate in contests/promo/giveaways,btohqsg
Ok so it’s much more easier alr.,btohqsg
Still have restaurants ask to show vax status,btohqsg

Ya I think I’ll get to it during this weekend.,btohqsg
Msia is the one which might demand kopi money lol,btohqsg
Previously  unvaccinated individuals could not dine out or enter shopping malls  but from May 1  they will be allowed to do so.Premises will no longer require the public to check in using the MySejahtera app  which is an app similar to Singapore’s TraceTogether  and its use will be optional.- Vaccination status not required. Mysejahtera is optional for them.. i didnt see any during hari raya weekend but yeah they CAN ask for app if they wan to. nobody will lah haha -,btohqsg
Ya but not sure if we can use TT in Malaysia?,btohqsg

In theory yes. But in real life  it helps show where the vehicle infront of u is  due to poor visibility,btohqsg
running light would have shown isn't it?,btohqsg

… what about alfa romeo and bmw e30…?,btohqsg
what did the guy do? put a larger battery?,btohqsg
Also what helps EVs go faster is not a bigger battery but the number of motors and how good they are,btohqsg
Bigger batteries come with the package just to make sure the car is still practical,btohqsg
There's a Giulia GTA M at the Alfa dealer in Singapore this week!,btohqsg
Not that simple is also how much torque the car lost on the wheels,btohqsg
A lot of 0-100 so call 3 second are slow as lose a lot of torque,btohqsg
Agreed but that is common for all cars,btohqsg
this is a given. no need to educate here. there is only a maximum number of  motors you can put. and after that ??? 😉,btohqsg
I was referring more to what specifically changes for EVs,btohqsg
can put 8 motors mr arnav?,btohqsg
Tesla is so fast when launch is because they managed to lose lesser torque,btohqsg
Because there is torque loss based on tires  surface  tire temp  etc. etc. Due to many reasons,btohqsg
Not only these also how the computer distribute the torque,btohqsg
Actually more than the torque loss  Tesla has instant torque on launch unlike ICE cars which need to reach a certain powerband  hence the instant launch,btohqsg
Other ev also is instant torque,btohqsg
Power delivery is limited to change driving experience  all not going for fastest 0-60,btohqsg
yes but some love tesla brutal acceleration,btohqsg
that 1 no money  and if i got money to buy that i will buy roadster,btohqsg

Thought it was meant to be out a while back,btohqsg
Ya man i Check with the sales they said around 2 years now all over demand   even model y delay and waiting time in Australia over 1 year,btohqsg
I think is the chip and battery issue,btohqsg
Same for all other brand of cars,btohqsg
Over demand or Haven't started production  Elon said start in 2023 only,btohqsg
i not saying about roadster that 1 is sure over 1 m in sg,btohqsg
now tesla is facing over demand issue in the whole world,btohqsg
that why they keep raise the price month by month,btohqsg
Generally Tesla models a bit delayed  due to the claims made then need to rework again to make sure they meet them,btohqsg
yup it is not easy to do mass production,btohqsg
cybertruck and roadster delayed for 2 years liao,btohqsg
they cant meet demands for their cars. but with austin and berlin in full production mode  cybertrucks will be produced next year,btohqsg
this will be a hot seller. many bookings already,btohqsg
I feel that the Ford f150 lightning  hummer ev and Rivian r1t are good competitors as well,btohqsg
ooh yeh that rivian is sick,btohqsg
Rivian has started deliveries now and ford has the faith of most consumers in the States,btohqsg
Plus the rivian is using a skateboard platform which will make it easy for other companies to buy that platform and develop their vehicles on it or for rivian to make other cars,btohqsg
hopefully this come in rhd too,btohqsg
Sadly too big for Singapore :(,btohqsg
Like the jeep gladiator is already too big for our roads,btohqsg
ford just sold alot of rivian shares,btohqsg
to me tesla strongest competitor is byd,btohqsg
Since borders are open  will you be going Sepang to really go on track with other cars properly instead of only red light victories alone when probably no one else around is looking for that?,btohqsg
Went alredy problem is sepang no charger,btohqsg
Can only do 3 laps then have to go away and charge,btohqsg
good point.. where is the nearest charge point from Sepang?,btohqsg
How was the experience running the car on track?,btohqsg
Not me running   I haven’t drive to Malaysia yet   is seeing car club pplWent there for field report can share some wait ar,btohqsg
oh come on. surely you can find a charge in KL. lots of teslas in KL,btohqsg
use google map top find la. so many,btohqsg
What’s your lap time? Can you do 2 min 15,btohqsg
sir sepang is an hour frm KL,btohqsg
Aiyo. There are many chargers there. You just have to plan nicely. Surely don’t have to come back to singapore to charge,btohqsg
hahaha ya but no need go back KL luh,btohqsg
"Fastest timed lap (3 people inside  battery red! and power down) was 3 min 00.994 secThe battery started at 79% we did 8 laps  battery at 37.5%  averaging 5.18% per lap if you include cold laps. During hot laps  7% per lap.Car was steady  balance good  no snap oversteer. Astounding was braking distance was very very short  even at 205kmh at turn 1  can brake at 160m I think. So I consistently braked too early for this car.But definitely this car needs to lower 1.5 inches to 2 inches  need 20"" tyres or higher tyre pressure than 3.2 bar. Brakes with performance pads didn't even get super hot actually.Battery turned RED after 2 laps  precisely at turn 2 lap 3. Power degraded. Rear motor is next to turn yellow. Sepang is really hot!Acceleration is incredible fast but need colder climate.",btohqsg
This one is leisurely drive with a passenger inside. He’s taking it easy,btohqsg
You need to use the brake pedal or single pedal let go good to brake?,btohqsg
Deceleration should regenerate power to battery right,btohqsg
Should do lap time with just you driving,btohqsg
Can decelerate in turn one? Say coming at 220,btohqsg
This is a friend field report,btohqsg
After one lap abs then you continue that turn 1 will have high speed,btohqsg
Nice leisurely drive lah.. no wonder quite far from the usual closer to 2min from performance cars. Some of them really quite scary.. Low 2mins one. That one my two round things also shrink,btohqsg
Stock car vs mod car things,btohqsg
Skill also do the major part,btohqsg
Airport sepang klia is nearest to charge,btohqsg
I’d think it can easily do 2 min 30 seconds or better.,btohqsg
I go when charger is there,btohqsg
This is the timer lap for m3,btohqsg
Very near ? He said inside don’t have   gotta drive out,btohqsg
Kl has many Tesla users and many charge points,btohqsg
Just don’t go to east coast Malaysia. You go to use home charging.,btohqsg
Johor and Kl Selangor lots of stations,btohqsg
In Kl you can also rent a Nissan Leaf for rm150,btohqsg
A few times. Very very wide track. Lots of rooms for errors .,btohqsg
I might rent a Ev to see how it feels like driving before buying one.,btohqsg
U can tune in track mode,btohqsg
So far I have not had a chance to use track mode,btohqsg
How else to practice to test the car but on track,btohqsg
Nowadays many cars have so called sports or sports plus mode,btohqsg
Bet the battery must be very hot after one lap. How does EV cool down battery,btohqsg
Track mode to me is for advanced driver   ppl like me at most use default mode,btohqsg
I don’t know what to tune or adjust also,btohqsg
Nice. I’d really love to see Teslas non-leisurely driving at Sepang for sure. like keep leisurely driving to Singapore roads and non leisurely driving to Sepang where everyone is on the same page and go for timing! Would be fun!!,btohqsg
I prefer to cut taxi lane,btohqsg

Recently our weather is like bbq,btohqsg
What car did you try on sepang? Quite fun,btohqsg
I did not go to Malaysia yet till now   is car club friends they are indidrb,btohqsg
Got race queen to see I miss it,btohqsg
And the famous guy from the acs motoribg is there,btohqsg

But in the past what car did you use on the track. Do you like the track,btohqsg
Only use Mini Cooper s before,btohqsg

Yo guys. For turbo car issit better to put a bov   close pod or open pod. Close pod is used mostly for turbo car n open pod for na car. Bov is supposed to store pressure and release Into the engine. Heard some ppl say using the bov messed up their air fuel ratio and sensor can't sense it properly.,btohqsg
if you running stock or not so aggresive stage 1  dont really need BOV,btohqsg
BOV is to release the pressure which prevents compressor surge. Compressor surge is when the air hits the closed throttle and goes back into the turbo which spoils stuff like the bearings,btohqsg
So probably I just get a CAI like hks,btohqsg
After rim n bbk will go for CAI and maybe intercooler,btohqsg
okay  just wanna lyk that CAI by itself is minimally effective to bring up the hp. CAI also decrease low end torque.,btohqsg
welcome to the zhng world where there is no end to zhnging🤭🤭,btohqsg
Yup so thinking issit close pod a better choice,btohqsg
Or a CAI needs a tune to bring the low end up,btohqsg
You can increase bhp by doing all these things?,btohqsg
simple stage 1 tune can bring up HP by alot already,btohqsg
I am just saying that CAI by itself is not really useful. It needs to be paired with a few other supporting mods to actually produce results 👍👍,btohqsg
Bmw g80 m3 wheel on Mazda 6?,btohqsg
Y spoke style is bmw specific,btohqsg
Wish they brought in the project 8...,btohqsg
Wow boss rims. Looks hyper aggressive!,btohqsg
Wah who car? Yours? Nice rims.,btohqsg
LoL forget it....big brand doesn't mean no rogue agent,btohqsg
Anyone knows whats the dark grey stains which tends to appear under the side mirrors  car logos  door handles of car  especially white car.Any method to clean these stains off the car?Appears like water dripping marks,btohqsg
Wipe will do  dust dirt accumulated in the joints  rain sunny a few times will kena.,btohqsg
Let me go take some photos and share,btohqsg
Tried wiping but seems like it became permanent? Any wash liquid is able to resolve this mark?,btohqsg
can try use clay bar to rub off when washing your car  or use those waterless wash spray try polish off,btohqsg
Try APC   if it doesn't work ull need to polish. Clay only when needed cause It will scratch and Marr the paint.,btohqsg
Just normal wax will get rid of it. Very obvious on white coloured paintwork.,btohqsg
Cannot avoid. Especially after rain. Those are dirty trapped in the gaps. When it rains  it flushes down on the paintwork.,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips. Will try out each of them,btohqsg
Apc is a brand of cleaning solution?,btohqsg
So what we shd do is to wipe off immediately after we experienced rain?,btohqsg
Yes i saw alot of white coloured cars having alot of these ugly drooling stains ...my goodness,btohqsg
cant really prevent but you can do a ceramic coating to minimise the stains  weekly washes shld be done too. For now if you cant wash it off  just go and do a polish and ceramic coat,btohqsg
Water marks drying and baking onto paint under sun over time….,btohqsg
no problem! As a car enthusiast with OCD  always nice to see people take good care of their cars!,btohqsg
Mr Xun is very helpful and has provided me some very helpful life tips too.,btohqsg
Yes. But too many areas to wipe. Once dried  normal shampoo can't remove them. Need to apply wax and wipe off. Just get those cheap wax will do the job.,btohqsg
All purpose cleaner. Got a few brands for car,btohqsg
How long does ceramic coating last on the averge?,btohqsg
If your car is always parked under the weather. Some lasts only few months. Can't prevent watermarks.,btohqsg
really depends from brand to brand  i go for the mid tier ones so about 9mths under minimal care.Minimal care = often left under the sun and driving on roads w lots of debris,btohqsg
sometimes the cheaper ones last 3 months and wear out,btohqsg
I've got bad experience with some. Gave up. Now just kaki DIY.,btohqsg
Before sign up  say can prevent watermarks. After job done  found watermarks after 2 months  went back to ask them  they act gangster.,btohqsg
aiyoo haha  no worries  clay+ ceramic coat can do at home if you want,btohqsg
a lot of low quality job... I paid 200+ for coating after 1 year of sun and rain still have beading,btohqsg
those good one deserve continued patronage,btohqsg
I use Sonax Brilliant Shine. Happy with it.,btohqsg
yep thats a very good brand haha,btohqsg
"i dare not say any brand ltr kena yellow card for ""promoting""😂😂🫠🫠",btohqsg
Apply and wipe. Dun even need to buff.,btohqsg
must know how to apply lor  i have seen ppl mess the coat before😂😂,btohqsg
So simple also can mess ar,btohqsg
i look at the car why half the car beading the other half not beading🫠🫠,btohqsg
Haha there is ceramic and there is ceramic. how you prep and apply also matters. Don’t forget the maintenance part too after application eg shampoo compatibility.,btohqsg
It’s definitely not a magic pill so you need to be mindful of care of it so it cares for your car longer in a way,btohqsg
there is petrol kiosk ceramic then there is real ceramic,btohqsg
Definitely need to find a good place and also take care of it,btohqsg
Like those hairstyle demos in the mall,btohqsg
Do half the hair  then say pay extra for the rest lol,btohqsg
And it doesn’t stop at the body ah… there is windscreen  and rim ceramic coats too,btohqsg
If you want to go further  some even PPF their headlamps to protect it from chips etc,btohqsg
Different owners approach this to different extents so… just need to figure out how much money  love and time you want to put into this 😄😄,btohqsg
I'm using Graphene Coating.Think got 3 coat.Cannot go petrol kiosk car wash. They use sponge. 😅Only mint cloth.Weekly water wax.I Let carpark uncle wash 4x / weak. They use cloth.,btohqsg
There's some who detail the car and do ceramic coating and then put on ppf over that and switch out every 2 years to make sure the ppf stays clear,btohqsg
I do actually. Reason is not so much only the PPF  but the adhesive…,btohqsg
Wait.. only headlamp ah.. not the body.,btohqsg
Yeah the adhesive can damage the headlamp glass and stay on  especially in the weather we have here,btohqsg
Headlamp is one key area that many forget to protect and it hurts them a lot when they need to replace the whole unit if the glass itself cannot be replaced,btohqsg
But those who do full body next level,btohqsg
full car ppf is a waste of money imo,btohqsg
do front sufficient to protect against stone chips,btohqsg
I just protect headlamp.. no budget to do whole front sir haha,btohqsg
then again if lucky enough to be able to afford ferrari  full car ppf is chump change,btohqsg
Really depends on one's preference and the amount of money they have. Some prefer full car ppf to make sure that the paint looks even as the ppf ages. And it protects against micro scratches and scratches all across.,btohqsg
Impact areas are useful too though,btohqsg
Deleted. Gonna go back to sleep,btohqsg
😁 He got there coz he knows how to use his money wisely?,btohqsg
Yeah   and buying a coe Ferrari is no big deal also,btohqsg
quite good lah... road tax and insurance also not cheap but I think more importantly.. it is owning a work of art and tech combined  and the whole history behind.  The lines of a Ferrari and its engine/sounds  quite irreplaceable tbh.  The owners don't even need to try to prove anything lah,btohqsg
and its still mostly a 2-seater car so most I am guessing have several cars for family etc?,btohqsg
Dun worry... Usually soap and water or cleaning wax will do it,btohqsg
Don't think I'll ever get there  but I'm happy with what i have so I'll settle for looking at ferraris from afar,btohqsg
go Dubai or Europe stay lor... cars are cheap . drive e class here can drive supercar there,btohqsg
me too me too. they are beautiful machines to look at for sure. still brings out a certain excitement when I hear and look at one.,btohqsg
no need lah.. just go there and holiday  then rent them to drive around for fun. most are leased there anyway.,btohqsg
i personally wouldn't want to stay in those places tbh,btohqsg
Rather go europe for holiday personally lol,btohqsg
rent in sg aso can. just rent 1 day lor.can take a look pix update n haolian on FB instagram😂,btohqsg
i leave that for youngsters lah.... uncle here already... still want to hiao,btohqsg
i'd rather keep the cash in my pillow and have sweet dreams,btohqsg
Exactly... rent in sg to enjoy traffic lights,btohqsg
LoL 50% discount so 50% effort,btohqsg
that one ok lah. in fact one would happy.. stop more  go slow so that people can gawk and take pic of you mah,btohqsg
I rmb seeing a wrapped scirocco  with half BAPE camo... so i thought the wrap must be 50% off,btohqsg
I know is some kind trend la but still had a good laugh,btohqsg
That the fun part actually haha,btohqsg
At traffic light so ppl walk can see your car   and other motorist also,btohqsg
And u can rev at red light,btohqsg
wahhh the engine  exhaust and smell of exhaust,btohqsg
sg fast n flashy cars are meant to be driven slow to be admired,btohqsg
Yes and do sudden acceleration for show off,btohqsg
like 'hi are you looking at me?',btohqsg
Maseratis have the best sound  if want the whole package  lambo,btohqsg
ya scared the shit off all pedestrians,btohqsg
Cleaner wax I use the turtle wax extra carnauba.. spray let absorb a while then wipe and buff,btohqsg
imagine if no one gives a f wherever they go  or when they start up  no one bats and eyelid  and no one even stops to take a pic,btohqsg
buy buy buy. coe masa still affordable,btohqsg
Yes but Maserati are really slow   some ppl laught at it actualy,btohqsg
especially the millenia walk car owners,btohqsg
Hear the vroom vroom and still there,btohqsg
Mr Xun told me once  take a nap  wake up  then the car finish changing gear,btohqsg
Bahahaha slow nvm  let people have eargasm,btohqsg
I ever got a friend trying impress me and my partner with his Maserati,btohqsg
My partner actually ask have u even accelerate,btohqsg
wan accelerate buy model 3 performance can liao. wat lambo Ferrari aso need smell smoke at traffic... opps no smoke😂🥰,btohqsg
Nah got a lot of car faster then Maserati,btohqsg
wahahahahaha. they got nothing to prove lah,btohqsg
Maserati is like Ferrari 2nd division,btohqsg
Cause it sound very nice but the acceleration is totally mismatch,btohqsg
for those who can't afford Ferrari,btohqsg
but that's just my personal opinion ah. no offense to any Maserati owner here,btohqsg
those who can't afford Maserati will buy Alfa Romeo... it's poorer Italian cousin,btohqsg
Except maybe the top end.... mc20,btohqsg
Car. Fast but no skill pls drive a getz,btohqsg
get a bicycle safer for other road users,btohqsg
and more dangerous for yourself hahahaha,btohqsg
i know my cycling skills (poor) and i don't trust local drivers,btohqsg
I always thought if buy alfa must buy the quad or don't buy,btohqsg
especially you know those who like to accelerate and cut people using taxi lanes,btohqsg
Can’t compare with Hyber cars la at least need a model s to hao lian HAah,btohqsg
Quite a number of model 3 performance owner buy as spare car,btohqsg
yeah for the maid to go market buy vege,btohqsg
Cheap what 250 k for a 500 horse car,btohqsg
wonder hassle or not if dun stay landed,btohqsg
250k for a 3 second car,btohqsg
Your maid can come home 5 mins faster,btohqsg
it has my vote for best value Nm/$ car,btohqsg
most convenient coz they can charge in the driveway,btohqsg
very fast but Tesla look a bit plain...,btohqsg
Newer condos all come with charging lots... existing condos also planning to install,btohqsg
don't need to worry about sharing with people  or getting fined if you don't move your car from the Chargers after it's completed.,btohqsg
Hdb mscp and open air parking  that one idk what is the plan,btohqsg
used as taxi in some countries leh,btohqsg
ya saw a lot in Amsterdam,btohqsg
Yup   for that price   depreciation around 25 a year,btohqsg
Can always go around disturb ppl,btohqsg
if ev owners will all be cooperative and responsible  I think all will be fine.,btohqsg
finish charge please come down and move your car away,btohqsg
guess noone dare to disturb u aso if they know tesla,btohqsg
Lot of them like bmw 216,btohqsg
I think can't be bothered lah,btohqsg
Subaru Forester tailgate me and such lol,btohqsg
But I'm fine with all the idiots who move on from BMW Merc to tesla  finally can remove the black sheep,btohqsg
Even Mazda 6 want to over take me,btohqsg
all having leisurely drive leh.. why disturb disturb all,btohqsg
true Tesla dun look like those tiong chia. look like Mazda 3 type normal car😂,btohqsg
Sleeper ma  if people want disturb you just disappear,btohqsg
i find some tesla owners really get disturbed very easily. i overtook a couple before  they get very stirred. think people want to race with them and start cheong here cheong there,btohqsg
like... I just want to find a place to pee sir.,btohqsg
Maybe the way u overtake themOr your car too loud,btohqsg
i go my way and they go theirs lah. why think too much about other people's car and feel so quickly it is a competition,btohqsg
Too much ego on sg roads liao,btohqsg
I think yours is a modded car,btohqsg
Tesla is unsafe... loud pipes saves lives,btohqsg
Just don't rev in middle of the night,btohqsg
wait I buy Tesla stock first see can get 1 free Tesla car,btohqsg
respect goes to those who are respectful of their surroundings and slow crawl when entering residential areas so as not to disturb people sleeping.,btohqsg
It ok 1 la u drive a fast car sure got ppl want disturb you,btohqsg
eh wah this statement... don't know whether to laugh or cry,btohqsg
Quite difficult though  BMW officially the 2nd in sales after toyota in sg  so statistically still likely to have black sheep,btohqsg
Merc is everywhere. as much as toyota,btohqsg
Oh that report is for AD,btohqsg
So I'm guessing PI market is quite big also,btohqsg
Bmw driver don’t signal 1 move over to tesla   now left with fmaily car like modded 216 coe 520,btohqsg
Coe 1 a lot actually especially c180 lot of ah beng go and mod it,btohqsg
Some quite nicely done lah. C63 kit even. 👍🏼,btohqsg
Coe 180. cheaper than buying a brand new civic,btohqsg
Yeah but provlem is they drive very agreesive and reckless so attract ppl to disturb them,btohqsg
aso a lot ah peh drive Coe 180. my block got 1,btohqsg
Most of the time it’s always driver issue,btohqsg
Yes so ppl get angry   u si ginna drive a coe mod car made so many noise,btohqsg
What do you think of this W204 CGI. Can buy and keep till end of COE renewal? I'm having this thought,btohqsg
COE if still expensive like now  then forget it lol,btohqsg
These days ev drivers also drive like that mah  cut taxi lane  accelerate off traffic light  hog lane 1 for ICE cars,btohqsg
Yes taxi are number 1 hogger especially transcab,btohqsg
If you want to scrap  could be a good buy if you find a decent unit. If the COE is still expensive  might not be worth to renew,btohqsg
aiyo drive anyth also can drive like a d*ck one😂😂 lorry can end up in lane 1 too😋👍,btohqsg
Not easy to find job in Dubai,btohqsg

old Merc pre 90s good. built to last,btohqsg
R129 etc all beautiful cars to work and restore,btohqsg
Yes that why nowadays jap car also not reliable  as they are the things that break easily haha,btohqsg
Merc very reliable actually till after millennium when they decide to turbo all their cars and put alot electronic gadgets,btohqsg
Yes that why catch fire also,btohqsg
in Europe or colder areas are ok. come to sg they buay tahan,btohqsg
that's y Jap like Toyota or lexus still stick to NA. suit our hot climate better,btohqsg
Lexus also hybrid or turbo liao,btohqsg
Na cc too big waster fuel and high road tax,btohqsg
hybrid ok... turbo not all . just some. hope they remain Na. but they might need add in turbo sooner or later to lower down cc competed with germans,btohqsg
Is is all turbo or hybrid,btohqsg
Only like es got hybrid or na,btohqsg
i have driven this for a whle my friend asked me to drive his,btohqsg
Turbo is the way to go  few years after warranty everything start leaking then earn from selling parts,btohqsg
after 5 year turbo car will start leak...,btohqsg
the 159 jts 2.2 is the first gdi car from alfa that got it right.,btohqsg
Never knew Tesla's had a HUD 👀👀🤭🤭,btohqsg
merc turbo still okay  but the electronics really not the best haha,btohqsg
Last time still got sc that sound like ev,btohqsg
I thought only zzzzzzz or speaker noise,btohqsg

Yankee candle - clean cotton   bath body works - ocean and aircon adapter,btohqsg
Yankee candle best  the air vent one that is the leather fragrance is perfect,btohqsg
your car? how is the reliability,btohqsg
Kinda sexy that why I like to floor,btohqsg
If that's sound  then anything ice is probably too loud for you,btohqsg
Can u still hear it even if you turn on the sound system,btohqsg
i like cars that makes me go deaf,btohqsg
where will whine so loud one haha really meh,btohqsg
Get a back seat driver makes lots of sounds,btohqsg
u go listen audi supercharger or even dodge supercharger cfm louder then tesla maybe not even close haha,btohqsg
floor yes  but idt the noise is the same haha,btohqsg
All I hear from Tesla's are people screaming about instant torque inside or passengers being scared when the driver floors it everywhere and cuts off people with aggressive driving,btohqsg
hahaha right right  i got see on road before very fast sia but abit unnecessary they keep flooring on the fast lane😬,btohqsg
Love the effort they put in the sound   interior design and the overall feel,btohqsg
Don’t like this la got tesla driver like me always get bullyAlso ma,btohqsg
I thought you're too fast to be bullied mah,btohqsg
Just tail gate and high beam,btohqsg
Just just tail gate and high beam,btohqsg
I think if they're tailgating and high beaming  you should move out  road hogging no?,btohqsg
If they're tailgating and keeping up  probably means they can go faster and want to move ahead,btohqsg
No   u can be in middle lane   and disturb that guy   he know his acceleration can’t win . So just stay behind you,btohqsg
aiyo why disturb no need la  on signal go left or right lane then go past him lo,btohqsg
Idk   maybe ppl driving speed limit thinks they helping those behind ?,btohqsg
no need like until like that la middle lane leh give chance abit,btohqsg
Why disturb though  if you know he cannot out accelerate then you know already. Let him by or speed up?,btohqsg
Is they got emotional damage when I try to change lane they accelerate  so I also accelerate and take over Thier lane,btohqsg
Get emotional damage   don’t try overtake so tail gate,btohqsg
I think this one more than them you got emotional damage one,btohqsg
No la just abusing the acceleration,btohqsg
U want go which lane can go which lane   does not matter they give way anot,btohqsg
aiyo give chance la. be nice to others can alr no need show who’s car faster if anyt that one they see tesla alr know,btohqsg
Actually no leh some of them really aggressive,btohqsg
How bout those normal drivers leh..,btohqsg
Of course give way to them,btohqsg
give chance abit la trust me,btohqsg
I think if you speed up next to them instead of peacefully letting them by,btohqsg
they aggressive ones u tailgate or flash that one make situation worst also eh,btohqsg
Yes so is best ignore them if not they kiss u and run as Thier brake too lousy,btohqsg
see!! ignore is best then how come js now u say tailgate and flash 🤣,btohqsg
my philosophy so good ah hahahaha,btohqsg
I don’t tail gate ppl   ppl tail gate me,btohqsg
I think tail gating is very rude and dangerous,btohqsg
If want just over take them why tail gate,btohqsg
need more tender loving care than Jap... I change gear oil every 10k together with oil change..sfsg..n I dun whack. it's senior citizen liao😂,btohqsg
But I know some ppl get angry when the car deliberately slow down so to block them from overtaking,btohqsg
I seen a lot of such ppl on the road,btohqsg
yeah i do that... when the person is impatient. i normally would switch to slow lane when i see one coming. but he is coming so near me  i give him a jolt,btohqsg
i cant stand rude and impatient drivers.,btohqsg
they cant even wait for me to switch lane,btohqsg
Ya lol a lot of such road bully 1,btohqsg
give him a jolt when he does that.,btohqsg
Some time I will wait for them about to over take me then I accelerate and take back the lane,btohqsg
you actually dontr have to change gear oil often. changing at 10k is really not necessary. i dont even change my diff oil for 5 years.,btohqsg
There’s a lot we can learn from German drivers on Autobahn. Lane 1 when overtaking and when road clear they go back to Lane 2. Or even if they’re in Lane 1 and they see a car rapidly coming from behind in their rear view mirror  they just give way coz that guy is clearly going faster because he wants to. No drama  no bruised ego. Nothing to prove. No “wah you think your acceleration so good? I can thrash you one if I want to”  or angry faces or flashing fingers. Just .. road courtesy.,btohqsg
that is what lane 1 is. fast lane for overtaking,btohqsg
