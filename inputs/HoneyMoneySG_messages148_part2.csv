Hi guys  new to SRS recently. Just wondering what broker do you all use to invest in ETF tracking S&P 500 and some SG bank stock for dividend? Appreciate your sharing.,btohqsg
Hi anyone looking at ocbc fresh funds promotion  it did not state ocbc360 as eligible account in the tnc  is it eligible?https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/statement-passbook-savings-account,btohqsg
Is there a recent offer for cardup to pay property tax? Couldn’t find a promo code …,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Ty! Can put in funds today first and then send the sms once official tnc’s are out? Or better to just wait…,btohqsg
No clue. Haha. Depends on the actual tnc,btohqsg
I also have $100k in stash account. So we cannot withdraw a single cent or no bonus interest?,btohqsg
So long your current ADB is equal or higher than last month ADB.,btohqsg
May I check if I have both UOB One and EvoL  which one should I can cancel? Understood either card spending will be eligible for the one account bonus interest,btohqsg
Depending on your spending. Calculate which one gives you more cashback then cancel the other one.,btohqsg
The link you provided already state OCBC 360 not included,btohqsg
CPF FRS video update coming in at 5pm,btohqsg
Maybe hsbc really wanna looks like they are special,btohqsg
My guess is they want to gauge the response from the BTL offering  before going public,btohqsg
Hallo ppl  eg u are currently paying HDB loan and ur employment contribution can cover that loan and u have 30k in ur OA  but u don't wish to pay down the loan (2.6% can be easily beaten)  it actually make sense to invest into endowus rite? (100% equity portfolio). Any blind spot that I could potentially miss out? (No plan to OA > SA  as the investment return from endowus may help me pay down the house earlier).,btohqsg
Anybody else faced a similar issue with their SC 360 points?,btohqsg
Anyone noticed their Singapore Savings Bonds coupon payments today a bit weird?I only get for 1 issue that pays coupon in December... the others paying in December i never get anything as of nowno issue.. i saw wrong month column,btohqsg
Me. I think they will delay the bonus till April,btohqsg
The interest you received today is either Jan or Jul SSB,btohqsg
The Dec ones would have been paid in Dec and jun,btohqsg

ah sorry i'm blur... i see wrong column!!,btohqsg
Just emailed Singsaver  they will announce the winner in early Jan for the $700 voucher,btohqsg
Anyone encountered this : I just received a credit card from DBS out of nowhere. The card is not in my account when I check. I didn't apply for any new cards. Rather disturbing.,btohqsg
Yah loh  I should not have even attempted here Dec spending promo  so then Jan might get a lower amount,btohqsg
I am going to make a big payment of $1 520 for flight tickets of me and my friends. I was thinking should I use Citirewards to accumulate miles but I have already hit $1k with this card? On the other hand  was thinking  should I use SC Simply cash Credit card which gives 1.5% unlimited cashback without cap? So not sure which one will be better,btohqsg
Citi Rewards don't give bonus for flights in the first place,btohqsg
Greattt  thank you for prompt response ☺️,btohqsg
Could you provide the link? Couldn't find this.,btohqsg
Yes  but risk of going below 2.6% p.a. also. Anyway best to take as long as possible to pay back.Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Wrt trust cashback  for overseas spending  good. Local spend  debatable and lil bit tricky.,btohqsg
Just saw the email. But is it 2.9% + 1% =3.9%? No T&C,btohqsg
Based on their pattern  maximum also 2.70% p.a. bonus interest + 0.05% p.a. base interest + 1% p.a. Everyday+ rewards bonus interest.Maximum 3.75% p.a. EIR.Only scared this part:Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered for the December EGA Bonus Interest Promotion & November EGA Bonus Interest Promotion.,btohqsg
I got fee waiver with SCB like 3-4 months ago  but that is my last card with them,btohqsg
They just want to make things more complicated  pity for the operation team process (if no IT),btohqsg
@mttelegrammtmai tu liao  just go BTL.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I recently used my Amaze card at a store. The first 2 times the payment was declined and 3rd time it went through. However  I found out that the transactions actually went through to my citi credit card and I called the bank as well to verify that. Anyone encountered this before?,btohqsg
What I know for journey man credit card they usually don’t allow waiver. They probably know a lot of people get the card for free lounge access,btohqsg
For the CPF Top-up using EGA  do you guys apply eGIRO redirected from CPF?,btohqsg
What does the transaction say on your Citibank statement?,btohqsg
Both cards are good when used overseas or for FX transactions  no FX fees  just Visa rates. Trust Link card to withdraw money from overseas ATM  Trust Cashback card to pay overseas with possibility of bonus cashback.They are fairly ok locally too.,btohqsg
Called the bank  they  also said its charged and asked me to check with merchant,btohqsg
10-year average return on Singapore Savings Bond slides to 2.82%In contrast  the preceding month’s 10-year average return was 2.86%.https://bt.sg/ntTyHODL to existing SSBs!!!! hold till 10 years!!,btohqsg
Lucky i got some locked in at 3% earlier. Would have done more if i had more capital. Now bank interest rate is getting close to that.,btohqsg
yup it is a bet that in the long term  short term interest rates will dip below 3% p.a. if that makes sense..considering it is puttable anytime at 100% back to government.,btohqsg
oh i got this email too.. it just says 2.9% p.a. with no full details..likely that is unattainable one..>$2m and premier jade customer?,btohqsg
The only downside is the reference month is Oct instead of Dec.,btohqsg
Understand Grab rewards is not as great compared to previous years.However I have a deposit payment of around $3k to make for an ID that allows Grab or Paynow. Is it still a good idea to use Grabpay? Seeking some opinions.,btohqsg
I don't think it affects much. Just deposit to the human's account with $0 MAB in Oct 24.,btohqsg
