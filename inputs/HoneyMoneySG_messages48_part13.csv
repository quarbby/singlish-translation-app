Hi experts  I‚Äôm thinking to sign up OCBC 360 or UOB one account and I‚Äôm not sure which one suits me better.- Spends $700+ on credit cards- Salary crediting yes- Saves $500 incremental monthlyI understand UOB one offers higher rates based on these conditions  but I prefer the flexibility to switch credit cards. In this case  is OCBC 360 a better deal for me?,btohqsg
Uob has a few cards that you can use to fulfil then cc spend section. If u have 100k go for uob since u can easily fulfil those requirements and the cards eligible for spending are quite generous on cashback or miles too,btohqsg
If you switch card  you loss your Cashback earned from credit card if you can‚Äôt meet the minimum spend.,btohqsg
i chose OCBC 360 for the flexibility to use cards from different banks that i feel give me the most cashback/reward in case the one im using now got nerfed. I'm assuming thats what your switching means?,btohqsg
im using ocbc 360 alsoand use n90 credit card to pay for my rental (using cardup) to clock the 500 spend in credit cardthen using CRMC + Amaze card for my remaining spending,btohqsg
I saw the cardup charge rates like 2.2% most cards only get 1.2miles is it really worth getting cardup? What's the rationale?,btohqsg
with promo code it charge 1.75 % if not mistaken,btohqsg
ya not all categoryyou are right,btohqsg
Even so  with that 0.5% more your paying more using card up.At 2k X 0.0179 = 35.8 fees by cardup.2k X 1.3 miles X 0.01.25(miles worth) = $32.5You pay $35.8 for 32.5 worth of miles.,btohqsg
you got any better alternative of paying your rent ?,btohqsg
It gets even worst depending on the category rate and 1.2miles on certain card.And the lost of interest on your extra paid amount.I don't know maybe I'm missing something but why not just use cash and save that $3 every month?,btohqsg
anyone knows what is the highest paying FD now? Or is it stil T-Bills?,btohqsg
Can get money before hand la. FD still higher right,btohqsg
If applying uob privimiles card  should i choose visa  master or amex?,btohqsg
Master so can pair with amaze,btohqsg
If i dont spend foreign currency then i wont be having any benefits from the amaze card...,btohqsg
U still get same benefit across the 3 different card  but master can pair with amaze  unless u spend more then 25k then u go go for amex version,btohqsg
Visa and master no difference  infact visa charge more when u use for foreign currency spending,btohqsg
Citi Rewards also earns 4mpd for PHV / Taxi rides,btohqsg
uob one level 1 spending  ($500 per mth) only for certain caregories ?? as i have spend on vet and some restaurants  yet the tracker in uob app,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt be too sure  many people will be bidding for t bills since FDs are now near 3% levels. My suggestion  better put in a competitive bid  probability of a freak auction results are higher now,btohqsg
Check ur card transaction if it show pending or posted. Only posted will reflect,btohqsg

?? Why? Of course can book via app. If book from cdg app  will have booking fee and credit card charge no 10% fee. If street hail but pay using cdg app + credit card  will incur 10% fee. I don't quite understand your question.,btohqsg
