How's lexus Is250 reg year2006-2009. Is it reliable? Or there's a manufacturer year I need to keep out?,btohqsg
That's what I'm keen on actually. Hahaha  but very worried it will be like bmw,btohqsg

I heard many say lexus car are pretty reliable,btohqsg

Understand. I'm looking at lexus is250 now actually. Any manufacturers year to look out?,btohqsg
It only cost a bomb when u delay the required maintenance. Dont let it snowball and u are good,btohqsg
I have 2 friends with this car. One has over 300000km on it. With such mileage  you have to replace stuff over time. Starter motors  gearbox servicing  valve cover gaskets. When you mechanic asks you to replace something due to wear and tear  just do it. as long as you take care of it  it will keep going for basically forever,btohqsg
Cannot buy. Grab don’t recognise this model as premium,btohqsg
I know bro. Although u don’t intend to do phv  u still should buy a car that can do premium phv for good resale value. Since u already buying Lexus  might as well choose minimum es for better resale value or who knows next time u want to do phv?,btohqsg
U will have more options open,btohqsg
