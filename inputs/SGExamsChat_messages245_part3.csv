Hey everyone!With COVID-19 measures reducing opportunities to interact with cohort mates in university (which matters a lot esp to incoming freshmen)  I‚Äôve launched uni-specific telegram bots that match you with another student to start a convo (these chats are anonymous and occurs within the bot which acts as the ‚Äúmiddle man‚Äù).Just head to your uni‚Äôs bot and type/start!(And you‚Äôll match with whoever types the/startcommand as well!)Chat can be ended with the/endcommand (and you can match with a new user again).Just head into your uni‚Äôs bot below!NUS:@nuschatbotNTU:@ntuchatbotSMU:@smuchatbotSUSS:@susschatbotSUTD and SIT:@SUTDxSITbotI‚Äôve merged both SUTD & SIT into a single bot for now (until userbase is large enough)‚Äîdo intro your school at the start of every convo tho!‚Äî-Haha as the bot‚Äôs in its infancy  there may be some waiting time until the user base gets big enough! Do share this with your friends!You can exchange contacts  but do make sure to be cautious and stay safe! The bot has a ‚Äòreport‚Äô feature and you can disable pics from being sent as well using the/nopicscommand! Feel free to contact me if there‚Äôs any abuse!There may be occasional glitches/maintenance periods but everything seems running well as of now! You can drop me your feedback too!I hope y‚Äôall find this helpful! :D,btohqsg
It will look smth like this!,btohqsg

Hi everyone in Upper Sec/JC/Poly/ITE/Uni! Mentee applications for the Advisory Mentorship Programme 2021 are OPEN! üåü‚úèÔ∏è With 2 000 students expressing interest for 700 mentee spots with our 560 volunteer mentors in 2020  the Advisory Mentorship Programme is returning bigger and better this year with 16 mentorship partners and over 900 mentors from a wide range of occupations and industries.üè´ Open to students aged 16 to 28  this is your opportunity to be matched with industry mentors from your field of interest on a one-to-one basis. The Advisory Mentorship Programme runs from June to September  and applications close on 11 June  2359h (GMT +8).Apply to be a mentee now at:mentorship.advisory.sgüëà‚ùì Want to figure out how it works? Hear from last year's mentees at an info session this Friday  June 4  8pm:https://bit.ly/3p3vEh6,btohqsg
üåû excited to see everyone‚Äôs mentee applications! I‚Äôm from Advisory so feel free to dm me if u you have any questions~,btohqsg
Tbh it's nice if the same concept could be applied to asking for advice about different majors  ie you could have different chat rooms for different majors in universities  people who want to contribute information would join and wait to get matched,btohqsg
Yep!! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be working towards to! Haha there was just a bit of a chicken and egg problem when launching (people will only use the bot if there are already users)  so I kept it uni-based first (so there‚Äôs a large enough pool for matching and waiting time isn‚Äôt too long)! If the traction keeps up and there‚Äôs a large enough user base  I‚Äôll work on the option to match based on major!,btohqsg

I find it ok ah. Are we even allowed to say how,btohqsg
Like the process of solving those problems - no need the specific aspects.,btohqsg
Idk how to explain sia HAHA,btohqsg
I think tideman is quite advanced for an intro course,btohqsg
Reducing the problem to finding cycles in a graph and then implementing in an intro mod is wew,btohqsg
