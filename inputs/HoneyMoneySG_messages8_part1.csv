Sorry I have a noob question  I am new to investing and started using moomo. Prior to that  I used poems. For poems  I can bid and pay with the required timeline  but for moomoo  is it have to top up into the account first before I can bid? Thanks,btohqsg
Ahh I see  no wonder there is a difference. Yes my poems acc is cash plus account..Just find a little troublesome to top up first to trade ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Hahah market in a mess now,btohqsg
anyone kena stuck in Celsius ?,btohqsg
But this happened  today what not at the time he shared. Lol,btohqsg
Funny how you quote a 90% Hodlnaut content video just to prove your point.,btohqsg
And isn't investment a place that you need to do your due diligence and not enjoy the benefits and f the person if u are losing money?,btohqsg
I'm sure nobody expected Celsius to do a rug pull but as always  crypto is and always was a high risk play  more so than equities. Do NOT put more than what you could afford to lose.,btohqsg
In addition  I have also removed my CDC and Gemini codes. I'm keeping Hodlnaut and FTX for now,btohqsg
ownself put money in then dont blame others.,btohqsg
Always do your own research ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
CDC & Gemini also has issues now ?,btohqsg
They don't (for now). Just that companies with their own native coins don't really align with me,btohqsg
Feelsbad to be rug by Celsius,btohqsg
but FTX also has FTT ?,btohqsg
You still need FTX for the lowest cost crypto exchange  buy/transfer USD/USDC,btohqsg
Yeah .but confirmed a rug ?,btohqsg
First it was Luna terra  now is Celsius  next is Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
