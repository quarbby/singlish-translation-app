Dumb question  but isn't it an inefficient use of our society's time  money and resources if undergraduates don't end up working in an industry that is relevant to their degree?And isn't this a very prevalent problem currently  where a good majority of engineering undergraduates work in industries barely related to engineering?,btohqsg
