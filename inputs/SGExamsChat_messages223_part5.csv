Can poly students take private A at the same time,btohqsg
Is rp the only poly offering sports sci?,btohqsg

idk if im correct but i think theres no criteria to take private A,btohqsg
so technically u can grad at 18,btohqsg
plus they have no academic requirements,btohqsg
i rmb got some girl at cambridge graduated at 19 and got the bar at like 21,btohqsg

I pm u holy shit HAHAHA,btohqsg
things that i agree but i cannot say in public,btohqsg
kena stomp or some shit i cry,btohqsg
can but its difficult enough as it is for students studying for A levels full time. Would be better to go to a JC if possible,btohqsg
but if you were really determined  its possible,btohqsg
emphasis on the difficult part so you gotta make a good choice bro,btohqsg
Anyone from njc  can tell me what time does sch usually end?,btohqsg

If you don't mind me asking  is the phy dept in nj good?,btohqsg

Turnover of teachers in JC is pretty high... hence  even if the best dept.. really depends on whether the good educators are still there..,btohqsg
I’ve a sibling there taking pcme and he’s doing very well,btohqsg
ohh i see! im looking more on bio,btohqsg
hi guys  if we submitted our jae choices we can amend it bfr fri 4pm right?,btohqsg

bc my dad linked my email to his since i was born so im practically screwed,btohqsg
"They will say smth like ""you have make ammendment""",btohqsg

im only 17 i dont know anyth but i know idw to start sch on 29 jan,btohqsg
does anyone know if its possible to study for a uni degree while in prison?,btohqsg
I think you're pushing it a little too far,btohqsg
iirc  you get charged adult fare until you start JC?,btohqsg
after which the prices go back to student,btohqsg
But I just graduated from IB...,btohqsg
