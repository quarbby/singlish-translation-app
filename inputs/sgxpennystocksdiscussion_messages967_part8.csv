Hildrics placement at $0.027 in Vividthree completed the day before.Source:https://www.sgx.com/mobileapp?action=view&cat=company-announcements&id=KLDUJ9BSXGYX5085,btohqsg
Vividthree flushed out many already.With $0.027 being the recent placement  market is nice to allow retailers to get a better price than the placee investor (Hildrics).However  above is so only if you have the buying power and can buy up the stock. If don’t have  likely to be killed on contra.Anyways  judging from the daily chart. 📊  potentially a start of the reversal.DYODD/OSOD,btohqsg
ChatGPT says:QN: Some of the SGX-listed companies involved in crypto-related businesses include:1.Vividthree Holdings:Engaged in NFT ventures and blockchain gaming  including investments in the NFT gaming platform GammaR.2.SMI Vantage:Focuses on cryptocurrency mining  particularly Bitcoin mining  with investments in hardware to support crypto mining operations.3.010 Holdings:Ventured into blockchain and cryptocurrency mining but faced challenges during the crypto winter of 2022.Note: PS: SMI  a counter once favoured and played along by BBs with BTC/ETC correlation already delisted. Hence  now they are left with lesser options  Vividthree/O10. All up to the BBs.Also DYODD always,btohqsg
ChatGPT says:QN: Does SGX listed Vividthree has any crypto related businessesQN: How much did Vividthree invest in gammar,btohqsg
Pollux disposal of property.Might trigger some activity.Will likely take opportunity to sell off first if the spike comes. 🙌 But then again if the price action seriously good  might change mind or add back later also . Hence  always DYODD/OSOD and react accordinglySource:https://www.sgx.com/mobileapp?action=view&cat=company-announcements&id=SB3JK5RG5EXZ8NCD,btohqsg
