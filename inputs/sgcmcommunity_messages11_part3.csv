actually to sum up  those self entitled ones dont respect anyone else other than their own people. which is why you see so many hoggers here  other countries  you'll be hard pressed to find the hardcore hoggers that are so common here,btohqsg
the reason they dont do is singapore is due to heavy penalty. not because it is singapore,btohqsg
