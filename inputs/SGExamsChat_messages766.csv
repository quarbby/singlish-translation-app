I was like wth why is she telling me this,btohqsg
Was she expecting there to be like a treatment for it,btohqsg
Perhaps  she then went to ramble about how it took her so long to process it  then she went to confront her children,btohqsg
I wanna hear that convo bruh,btohqsg
"ah yes trauma dumping  my workplace also had one...looks like a mid 30s-40s yr old parent  but inside is a tiger parent ""My child taking her exams in 2 weeks (JC)  i take away her priviledges to use her phone. She told me ""but  ineed it for my studies"". I dont believe her""",btohqsg
literally idk why me and my colleagues decide to sit down and listen to this parent trauma dump all her child problem to us,btohqsg
"imagine a parent confiscating a JC's child phone because they want them to focus on their studies furthermore request their JC child to cook for their youngest and second child to show ""Respect""",btohqsg
Sounds like a lazy ass parent,btohqsg
after i heard her hr of rambling..i came to that conclusion,btohqsg
"her proceeding statement is best...""They dont hug me  why ah""",btohqsg

And I‚Äôm one of the calmest guy here,btohqsg
Btw hello  i know you have suffered from discord.,btohqsg
btw you guys know she is not allowed to use discord because her parents made her delete her old accs,btohqsg
Hey but still credit where credit due  I don‚Äôt think you will find a calmer person  have you seen anybody else that try to prove their points more calmer than me,btohqsg
This one I have no idea,btohqsg

You telling me the sge disc is like sushi city,btohqsg
Actually SGE generally has a younger population,btohqsg
I mean yea la there are like older people there,btohqsg
But I feel that the more active ones are like JC/poly age,btohqsg
sushi city is full of kids,btohqsg

Outfield camo on  need to actually do shit during outfield and in day to day life your men is your batch mate so no fks given to u,btohqsg

I feel like trying to apply for moe teaching internship programme or maybe I can work for treatsure,btohqsg
I just want to fk off from the fire station the moment I ord,btohqsg
depends on what ur doing in uni  i advise you to do something related to your field of studies so if you want to take internships during your holidays  companies will see that you already have experience and are then more inclined to hire you,btohqsg
Can asas sign short term contract?,btohqsg
then proceed to chainsmoke 3 packs a day for the rest of your 35 years of service,btohqsg
if i ever do sign  it will be with a degree,btohqsg

Heart issues are normally pes E9 so yea,btohqsg
they tried putting me back through pes c bmt 5 times but my cardiologist said no,btohqsg

Downside is they need to start their pay as officer,btohqsg
does ur heart condition still exist in you today?,btohqsg
And imagine need to compete with appointment with young officers,btohqsg
But how come your pes E9 status started only in 2017,btohqsg
issue is throughout my ns they never had a confirmed diagnosis like ok there's an issue but cannot pinpoint,btohqsg
I need go for cardiac scan tomorrow again,btohqsg
Like by then I thought BMT wouldn‚Äôt have mattered,btohqsg
nowadays i don't do much that'll trigger it,btohqsg
but it messed up my insurance for like a few years lol,btohqsg
unconfirmed diagnosis so they temporarily down pes me then kept doing it every time my FFI failed,btohqsg
until 2017 one MO just decided fuck it and made it perm,btohqsg
fitness for instruction. it's just a medical evaluation,btohqsg
biggest thing was my tendency to black out at times,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs a chronic issue nothing much can be done I think  hopefully they can just downpes you permanently,btohqsg
wld yall sleep in dri fit,btohqsg
my sleeping clothes is dri fit,btohqsg

going out i never ever wear dri fit tho,btohqsg
"idk what material isit but they market it as ""cool fit"" cld be cotton cld be another name for dri fit idk",btohqsg

I feel like it's unfortunately a very common story,btohqsg
Yes coz i did say that story before,btohqsg
Don't even care abt what cca I choose cuz,btohqsg
They don't even rly understand the system anyway,btohqsg
Mine is they cant accept that different gen stuff,btohqsg

Unfortunately in today‚Äôs world  more i see of parents over-imposing,btohqsg

Tbh tm perf arts q bad,btohqsg
I think dance is not bad,btohqsg
I rmb me n my friends thinking,btohqsg
My friend once told me if a non-musician can tell out of tune  it means the performance is v bad,btohqsg
Coz she told me that even if u play wrong  the audience unless they hv music bg cannot tell,btohqsg
Maybe i should drop by too,btohqsg
I lowkey feel like watching symphonic band,btohqsg

Expect to possibly do random shit by the sch tho,btohqsg
if wa1 doesn't kill me interview will,btohqsg
Make sure ur cher like u  i learnt that sometimes in interviews being cher fav can do u good,btohqsg
Nah it is not ogl  i doubt grades will matter a lot (like it is just 1 exam and ur first),btohqsg
tbh i plan to just apply ogl for fun,btohqsg

Wait wait so the votes were tied anot,btohqsg
I only knew of one v big one,btohqsg
Wah so they dun accept that the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô in their eyes lower votes,btohqsg
when they announce results the J1s all storm the confessions page,btohqsg
then in return the J2s shit on the J1s,btohqsg
Soz I don't rly shit on the j1s,btohqsg
Actually what is the confession acct,btohqsg
common tee shirt seen around here,btohqsg
Im surprised the confession was allowed to stay w toxicity,btohqsg
Maybe it was coz our toxicity stuff involve a sch leader oops,btohqsg
also got the team eunoia shirt,btohqsg
I think got some shit abt the,btohqsg
If can buy the dunman shirt,btohqsg
my nyjc friend ask if i got a spare aquila shirt for him to wear during national day,btohqsg
But they force admin to shit down our confession pg even w the censors,btohqsg
one of my shirts look like this,btohqsg
i don't even have the dhs shirt,btohqsg
Sth serious must hv happened for the sch leaders to come intervene,btohqsg

Can i re-enroll in tm and be a std forever,btohqsg
Leaking the whole document is just peak bodoh,btohqsg
I saw on internet but did not see before in public,btohqsg
Think the issue was more like,btohqsg
Of some students thr and stuff,btohqsg

Sometimes the real fun is the friends we made on the way,btohqsg
oh i thought other kind of std,btohqsg

But then be like nie is too far for me,btohqsg

i just got this shirt for myself,btohqsg
And also i dun think i hv capability of teachingüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
tmjc how long can only wear sch shirt for cny/national day,btohqsg
The most important work is the administration and the boring mundane task of making it work,btohqsg
On another side  i may hv ended up there if nie is in nus,btohqsg
I dun remember wearing traditional costume,btohqsg
trad costume can understand why jc wld ban tbh,btohqsg
Usually I do that by standardisation,btohqsg
Which is fucking Sisyphean but needed,btohqsg

And be under a relevant qualification,btohqsg
Can try lo but I heard the interview is the hard part,btohqsg
Good for you lor if that happens back in RP we get cut funding in future rounds,btohqsg
the NP ppl came to our sch for red camp,btohqsg
then they legit just force us to sign up,btohqsg
Which is really fucking anal cuz next round can get more signups,btohqsg
they would not stop bugging us for like 30 mins,btohqsg
then ofc end up nvr go,btohqsg
anyways by that point i alr decided on jc so dk what's the point,btohqsg
I remembered in tm everytime got someone promoting tuition at bus stop w a free foolscap,btohqsg
I'll be dammed if the reverse happened,btohqsg
on first day of ori someone was giving us laminated MF27,btohqsg
like what is the goddamn point,btohqsg
