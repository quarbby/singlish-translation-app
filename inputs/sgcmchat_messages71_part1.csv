But yeah true thats why i set it,btohqsg
at least yall get to look lah what the car look like,btohqsg
its dif from the ig post,btohqsg
i guess theres more teachers who are car enthusiasts in my school,btohqsg
but my fren fr said its my teacher one leh,btohqsg
i forgot all abt my bus enthu phase sia,btohqsg
but like tdy don have dk why,btohqsg
ok guys turns out my teacher actually has a mrs but that one is not his,btohqsg
THATS THE SAME LICENSE PLATE AS MY TEACHER ONE LEH,btohqsg
EH MY TEACHER MABUK OR WHAT,btohqsg
his ig post got mrs with that exact same license plate,btohqsg

He just dw u go scratch his car,btohqsg
but only three shots looked good,btohqsg
note that im a beginner so if photo not good tell me whats the problem then i will take another photo shoot tmr if the car there,btohqsg
i left the school edi ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
as long it looks good to you it doesn't matter. everyone's opinion of a good photo is different.,btohqsg
since the adjacent parking area seems clear maybe you can back up a bit to get a nice 3/4 shot of the car!,btohqsg
had to squeeze a lil bit,btohqsg
by that i meant like there was not really much space,btohqsg
i took some other shots too,btohqsg
but didnt think they looked good,btohqsg
Anyway it's like what was said here la,btohqsg
You'll improve with practice and experience,btohqsg
When I did my first video edit I was using a camera and not my phone and thus couldn't get many good tracking shots on the car,btohqsg
And the worst thing of all was I forgot to film in vertical,btohqsg
So we'll get better over time by evaluating ourselves,btohqsg
Non toxic feedback. Your angle here crooked,btohqsg
Try using a level or grid lines in your camera app,btohqsg
I FORGOT TO TURN IT ON,btohqsg
not rly my style but will try it one day,btohqsg
If you're focused on vertical then step away a little,btohqsg
To give more foreground and background,btohqsg
Wouldnt really say its orange but rather tan,btohqsg
Yo green + tan interior tho,btohqsg
It was the same as this,btohqsg
There's something with these Heineken lamps,btohqsg
Tan slightly darker and more brown,btohqsg

Yea i thought only pigeon and mina,btohqsg
