hi ppl  do you think since woodleigh village may delay up to 9 month (s)  will the rest of the projects also delay up to 9 month (s) or only selected projects??,btohqsg
Thus far my Jurong West Jewel BTO will be completed on the probable completion date as stipulated.... But other projecs were apparently delayed for about 5-9 months unfortunately...,btohqsg
So for projects stating delayed up to 9 months for example   only max up to 9 months or still have chances of being extended ?,btohqsg
Able to ask u guysUsually HLE takes how long to process?,btohqsg
Less than a week if u provide all the required document,btohqsg

Usually you can review the amount immediately  and will receive the notification in 1~3 days.,btohqsg
