Guys buying Malaysia car can convert to Singapore? How much is the price? Pm me,btohqsg
Iirc you can convert only if the car is older than 35 or it’s brand new,btohqsg
Basically like importing a car lor,btohqsg
more expensive than buy car in sg  you pay tax once in malaysia and pay again in sg,btohqsg
If the car at Malaysia 5 months is it can?,btohqsg
mileage must be below 20k km for import used iirc,btohqsg
So if the car is use for 5 months and the mileage is195km cannot is it?,btohqsg
last i checked 195 is less than 20000,btohqsg
Oh there isn’t a mileage limit,btohqsg
Just need to be less than 3 years old,btohqsg
So means which want is correct?,btohqsg
You can import it if it’s less than 3 years old,btohqsg
Then you have a bunch of fees you have to pay,btohqsg
1 000 000km mileage also can,btohqsg
As long as it’s not older than 3 years old,btohqsg
you still need a COE and pay the ARF  import taxes etc,btohqsg
You wanna import the new proton is it,btohqsg
The arf is gonna kill you,btohqsg
But I want to import but the car is 2008,btohqsg

"hi there  need an advice.. those who own an Avante CN7   I plan to change to 18"" rims but what tyre size would yall recommend...I was thinking of either 225/45 or 235/40.",btohqsg
not sure advante  i drive honda  but your tyre spec seems fine. just don't go too wide with 45 profile  will bua the fender.. 235/40 should be the better choice..,btohqsg
225/45 is better with 17 in the rim.,btohqsg
Depends on clearance in the fender lining,btohqsg
Best to check at the shop you get the wheels and tyres,btohqsg
They know what sizes will work,btohqsg
Or look online on wheel size,btohqsg
You can see in some markets Hyundai does offer 18s themselves and they use 235/40/r18,btohqsg
Elantra and avante are the same  this is for cn7,btohqsg
18 and 17 most common sizes in SG I think,btohqsg
Go 20 and up then start getting expensive,btohqsg
Plus 1 size up won't decrease fc by too much,btohqsg
If you do it right with the right tyre sizes,btohqsg
Plus the manufacturer fit 18s on his car also,btohqsg
Can alot zhng avante damn nice,btohqsg
Maybe he wanna poke out then camber 🤪🤪,btohqsg
The other day I saw an avante  the gen before cn7,btohqsg
All negative offset but no camber,btohqsg
Everything stock on the car apart from stickers and taobao lip spoiler,btohqsg
Then got model 3 wheels without the aerocover,btohqsg
Same tyre profile as model 3  assuming they buy as set,btohqsg
That's why I send cn7 link,btohqsg
Cause iirc k3 and avante same same,btohqsg
But follow wheel-size will never go wrong,btohqsg
Can see what rating to get also,btohqsg
I saw a avante N-line in performance blue  damn sexy,btohqsg
Fking stupid like jazz and fit,btohqsg
Wah bro my neighbor just buy i30 n,btohqsg

I bought 2 car from them… all hassle free. No need worry anything they will settle everything. The price is also good,btohqsg
Dun bother buying  sooner or later you’ll kena jailed for drink driving  by the time u come out coe expire alr,btohqsg
It’s true rite? They really can just transfer first by paying off the 3rd party and then transfer the asset to the buyer,btohqsg
Can u imagine u buy car from A and A tells u it’s B biz and they can’t transfer the asset to u…….,btohqsg
U can go n read it,btohqsg
Its funny how one consignment sale can go thru so many entities,btohqsg
Now you know why sometimes consignment or buy from dealer take so damn long for the car to transfer,btohqsg
Too much shady shit going on behind the scenes,btohqsg

Which is annoying from Just selling a product why need so many parties,btohqsg
My car (Audi A6) COE is expiring end of this month. Any suggestions: should i renew coe or get a car with just few years left in anticipation of COE dropping,btohqsg
Recommend short term car to tide over coe period,btohqsg
Consider this short term a class  stylish lookinghttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1208410&DL=4236,btohqsg
And they are related parties and both in car trade and yet have inter party transactions…,btohqsg
They have breached their sales and purchases agreement with the buyer and has must make good to the buyer but the auto lease is ultimate at fault so they hve to reimburse SHB…,btohqsg
And the amount is only 13 plus k….. go to court  money spent  time and reputation  whether right or wrong now all not worth it,btohqsg
The buyer really poor thing…. But one Van  pay in full still hve to kanna this,btohqsg
Why coe willl drop with so many phv,btohqsg
And increasing number of residence in sg,btohqsg
Party at fault doesn't admit nor return the money  so victim sue to force them pay,btohqsg
Yes my point is SHB should hve paid the auto lease off to transfer the van to the buyer,btohqsg
After all Auto lease applied the money towards a related party owing etc…,btohqsg
So one more lesson  dun pay in full… take some loan from a bank…. If bank involved this would not have happened,btohqsg
