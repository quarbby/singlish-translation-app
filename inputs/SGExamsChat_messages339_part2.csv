hello!! is it best to separate portfolios if they're for different courses (currently  i have them together in 1 place),btohqsg
nope  we don't allow job ads here,btohqsg
As long as you categorize them neatly so that each course can see what's relevant for them  it'll be ok.,btohqsg

The examiner will smack lips and shake their head before standing up and opening the door for you to leave,btohqsg

Hi guys I hv a question to ask about leaps 2.0. For this  does this mean that even if I switched CCA  but still have at least 75% in both  I can get level 3 for participation?? Because my teacher only gave me level 2,btohqsg
iirc must be the same throughout your 4 years,btohqsg
if u switch then u cant,btohqsg
U nid to stay in ur CCA for 4 years straight,btohqsg
Huh but I thought it nvr say same,btohqsg
If not how u get 4 years straight if u change xD,btohqsg
Huh but like other boxes it got say same but this nvr,btohqsg
This would be level 4 already,btohqsg
I send you whole table can you help me check?,btohqsg
Bcos right my tcher only gave me level 2 for participation and leadership when I feel I should get level 3 for both( since I hit the requirement),btohqsg
Am I right to interpret it as any cca as long as 75% each year?,btohqsg
"U got hit the criteria of  ""demonstrating.... contribution""?",btohqsg
I participated in SYF and one other event,btohqsg
and also I‚Äôm in the exco,btohqsg
I changed cca at end sec 1,btohqsg
Every year I attained at least 75%,btohqsg
But I was jst in different ccas,btohqsg
As far as I rmb from my batch. U nid to be in same CCA,btohqsg
Ohh I thought that would be under level 4 already,btohqsg
U might wanna check with Ur Cher why l2  nia,btohqsg
Actually for mine was a different case. I only took 2 years in my previous cca and switch to another cca because they are closing down my previous cca.,btohqsg
^but that was cus they closed down.,btohqsg
My examiners tired coz I was the last candidate  got a distinction in the end lol,btohqsg
