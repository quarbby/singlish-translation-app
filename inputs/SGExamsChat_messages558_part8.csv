even if that guy fucked up,btohqsg
honestly she had no right to call him out in the way she did,btohqsg
she’s not directly involved and isn’t even in the same campus,btohqsg
the fella was running was running for ntusu uncontested when they dug up a scandal on him that they say was hush hushed by the sxh,btohqsg
this lady here just called him out on linked implying that he’s a sexual assaulter or smth without proof and then he got a lawyer asked her to apologise and now has escalated the thing to a court case,btohqsg
that's a quick and clear summary. Thanks,btohqsg
for a prospective lawyer and a law student that’s kinda…. ironic,btohqsg
