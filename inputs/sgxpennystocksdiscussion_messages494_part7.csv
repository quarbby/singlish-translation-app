Pika World Daily Update: 5 August 2021The equity market mainly was down during the trading session after disappointing job figures. The Dow had fallen by about 0.9% whole the S&P 500 were down by 0.45%. The Nasdaq Composite marginally rose 0.1%.Job Data and Market ReactionThe lacklustre employment figure of 330 000  well below the 653 000 increase in private sector jobs  continued to haunt investors as the concern on hiring bottlenecks due to the Covid-19 Delta variant put pressure on the US equity market.Also  Pika World observed a continued weakness in the 10-year Treasury yield as a weaker labour market suggests the likelihood of muted inflation resulting in the yield falling to as low as 1.14% from 1.18%. The yield tends to move as new inflation and economic growth expectations are baked into the market.There is weakened general confidence in the economic growth  and this dynamic had been weighing on the equity market for the past week.Market Remains SupportiveAs Pika World had updated previously  the equity market seems to remain resilient as investors aren't willing to go out for a massive risk-off mode given that the government's job data on Friday will provide critical insight to see if the hiring bottleneck could be resolved in the next few months before taking conclusive action.Robinhood Had a Moon RideThe stock had one time in the trading session leap up to $85 before giving up part of the gain. While no news could help drive the stock price  the interest among retail traders is perhaps behind the rise.It was a dramatic movement for Robinhood stock as they began first-day trading last Thursday  falling by 8%. However  perhaps the massive buying by ARK Investment management had brought confidence to the investors.The company now trades at about 40 times of its recent 4 quarters revenue  many times of other brokerage firms that are usually trading at less than 10 times of their trailing revenue. Furthermore  Robinhood has not disclosed a date to release its second-quarter earnings  and it had previously warned investors on a weaker customer and revenue growth for the current quarter.What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Continuing Jobless Claims  which will remain roughly at 3260K.The Initial Jobless Claims  which is the focus  will be released simultaneously  and the figure estimate is 384K  down from 400K in the prior period.Some short-term Auctions of bonds will be done at 11.30 pm  which is expected to run smoothly without many spikes that cause equity volatility seen in the early part of the year.It is 5 August  Thursday  8.15 am in Singapore and 8.15 pm in New York. It is a challenging week as the market sets to find a new direction  but we hope you have a safe ride.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
