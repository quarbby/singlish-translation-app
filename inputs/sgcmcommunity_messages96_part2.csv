It is more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car fast,btohqsg
normal cars wont even make 2 lapsüòÇüòÇ car will overheat before u even finish ur second push lap,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs fun to drive a slow car fast it would be even better to drive a fast car fast,btohqsg
Nope. Most people is unable to wrestle the power of fast car.,btohqsg
Most people cannot keep fast cars on the tracks when driving them to the limit,btohqsg
Then you‚Äôre adding another variable to the equation,btohqsg
With all things constant One would be inclined to believe that it‚Äôs more fun to drive a slow car fast as compared to a fast car slow.Yes agreed.,btohqsg
It is not about variableIt is the fun factor that you are contesting when claiming there is no logic in my statement. Lol,btohqsg
But if you can produce the same amount of control over a faster car  why would you have any less fun as compared to the slower car. If anything you‚Äôd get a heightened sense of speed and adrenaline which usually correlates with more fun,btohqsg
Trust me  when if you drive a CS3  able to floor without reservation would be a lot more fun than if you need to hesitate your throttle on faster car.,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs lost upon you then I suspect logic isn‚Äôt part of this conversation LOL,btohqsg
I am guilty of flooring my car and I did not have issues of getting speeding tickets when your car is simply too slow. üòÇ,btohqsg
