Trade Bitcoin  Doge  and other crypto with zero fees on FTX. Use my referral code and get a free coin when you trade $10 worth.https://link.blockfolio.com/9dzp/8da376f2,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to usecrypto.comto buy stuff. I got the free 50 USd inside but I can't seem to buy any coins,btohqsg
I don't think u can use the free 50 usd to buy things,btohqsg
U have to stake 500 dollars and apply for their card to be applicable for that 50 usd,btohqsg
I think shld be locked for 180 days if Im not wrong,btohqsg
Hi Chris  have you done a vlog on FTX? Is there one you could recommend. I’m abit unclear on depositing and withdrawing fiat and other Cypto in FTX Wallet for purchasing/selling  crypto on the FTX platform (eg.  Are there any withdrawal fees for S$ back to my bank account?) TIA,btohqsg
Will have a video on this coming up on the best way to fund ftx/gemini,btohqsg
But if you mean step by step process  can check out Kelvi learns investing. I think he did a video on this already,btohqsg
This message needs to be spread,btohqsg
let's set the record straight hereFTX Pro appis the mobile version of FTX Exchange (FTX.com)- this is good for trading due to the ability to do limit buy/sell amidst other features- you get to do free withdrawals for BTC and should you stake FTT  free withdrawals for ERC tooFTX app (formerly BlockFolio)is a mobile-only app- it's good for free withdrawalsYou can transfer between the two platforms without feesBoth apps require separate registration but same KYCThink of it as One Country  Two Systems,btohqsg
My crypto guru@wilflareis here. Please direct your questions to him,btohqsg
Hi Wil For new investors into crypto and who prefer to buy and hold eg. USDC  and deposit into Hodlnaut to earn interest Which crypto exchange platform would you recommend?,btohqsg
FTX is the way forward for now (:,btohqsg
I think@ChrisHMSGprobably has a ref forFTX.comcan use his!,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply.What is the recommended min. Amount to try out the platform considering the fees involve?,btohqsg
Ftx has no min commission unlike stock brokers. They charge a small 0.02% fees per trade,btohqsg
So don't worry about the min amount,btohqsg
Thanks Chris.I read from FTX:There are also no blockchain withdrawal fees except for ETH  ERC-20 tokens  or small BTC withdrawals.  FTX users will pay the blockchain fees for all ETH  ERC20 tokens unless they have FTT stakedI realized Holdnaut uses ERC20 Network  any idea what's the charges by FTX?,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGChris what do u think of syfe keep posting sponsored content on their Instagram to promote untruths about how ""great"" their platform is? Their syfe core with China exposure tanked big time and retis performance has been dismal 🤢",btohqsg
Every business wants to promote themselves and that's normal. We as consumers must do our own diligence to filter out which content is right.,btohqsg
Hi  i try to withdraw usdt from FTX pro (using chris ref)  but stop at the 10usdt fee,btohqsg
Yeah usdt is more expensiveSo 8 stake 25 FTT for that,btohqsg

Yes  this method works as well. Must ask Wil to forward his step by step template message again,btohqsg

"Anyway  by now you all should know that Elon Musk was polling on twitter if he should sell 10% ($20B) of TSLA shares for the purpose of ""paying tax as goodwill""Actually he doesn't need any validation at all  but may be just an excuse to cash out from his stock options.We will likely see a (big?) downward pressure on TSLA stock tonight. And this will impact indexes like NASDAQ and S&P500 as well.I think it's more important on where is Elon going to use the money next  maybe crypto? And that's why the market is speculating and pumping crypto now (big green today)#notfinancialadvice",btohqsg
Morning Chris  regards Hodlnaut  would like to know more and hope you could give some guidance  like how much and how long to stay invested with them  also which are the better ways to avoid extra fees for withdrawing from exchanges and Hodlnaut  thanks a lot. BK,btohqsg
How much is very subjective to how comfortable you are putting crypto in an unsecured lending platform. For me the number is around $10K USD.How long to stay invested  i hope they last forever since it's a HODL platform.For avoiding fees  Btc transfer from FTX is free. For other coins  use the FTX Pro -> FTX Blockfolio -> Hodlnaut for no fees transfer.Can look at what was discussed here yesterday. And our in-house crypto guru Wil will be here to assist,btohqsg
Is there a guide how to start investing into crypto ？,btohqsg
Lets msg him which crypto he is buying. Hahaha,btohqsg
What is the cheapest way for transferring crypto out of BlockFi and selling it for cash? Thanks (:,btohqsg
I've promoted@wilflareto Crypto Guru admin  just in case any impersonator of him pm you and conduct scammy activities. Crypto is a dangerous world,btohqsg
i tink it depends on your goals and objectives. Crypto can be for passive income  trading  growth   or just preserve money (against inflation)   etc .,btohqsg
Thanks. Not sure which exchanges is the easiest to start with for newbie.,btohqsg
I feel  easy exchange usually comes with higher fees.,btohqsg
Will be releasing a crypto exchange video tonight 8pm,btohqsg
That is true. Likewise for stock brokers,btohqsg
the difficult part is the fiat to cryptos,btohqsg
the SGD pairings limited for most exchange,btohqsg
each exchange has their pros and cons  so i use quite a few  make use of the pros and avoid the cons .,btohqsg
coinhako is the easiest to buy with SGD   but fee highest. and not all coins able to allow u to transfer to other exchange platforms,btohqsg
Removed your referral code. You can pmH Tdirectly,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the best broker platform to do options? Is it tiger or IKBR?,btohqsg
What's TDA? means tiger not ideal to do options?,btohqsg
Tiger not ideal especially when you are trading spread options,btohqsg
something to do with the margin calculation which I also don't really understand,btohqsg
How about for newbie just starting to learn options ?,btohqsg
