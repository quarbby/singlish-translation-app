Why do ppl work at Mac,btohqsg
it's like thumbdrives. There is a part where it is powered on or off. That part spoils the fastest,btohqsg
A NAS with RAID has redundancy,btohqsg
and it will not be $2800. Last 20 years?,btohqsg
I only had one HDD fail every 3-4 years or so  and that is with 24/7 turned on,btohqsg
why do people even like her,btohqsg
I had 2 HDDs failed at the same time once,btohqsg
computer nerd shit being talked about,btohqsg
What's a good NAS with raid.,btohqsg
There were under warranty  so I managed to exchange. The guy told me it was very common,btohqsg
he thought I dropped the NAS  which I didn't. They just failed with bad sectors,btohqsg
I was lucky I backed up with an additional external HDD on top of the NAS,btohqsg
Bad sectors alone don't cause failure,btohqsg
A lot of it for some reason,btohqsg
When I mean fail I mean that the HDD is totally gone,btohqsg
Not detected at all by the system,btohqsg
and worse  it happened just before CNY,btohqsg
Almost that already. Some files can't be read,btohqsg
can detect  but can't copy out,btohqsg
I've 2 HDD  not detected at all. The USB connection is gone. Bad sector's hdd can still be accessed and backed up.,btohqsg
Cheaper version than Google drive:pCloud lifetime deal.,btohqsg
$350 euros  2TB for 99 years or when the company goes bankrupt,btohqsg
End up  I subscribed to Google cloud for 1 year. Thinking of longer term solution.,btohqsg
it's ok you building plane not computer,btohqsg
My most important data backed up to NAS  and few cloud storage.Google Drive  pCloud and IceDrive,btohqsg

Ik LOL nows not the time,btohqsg
depends on how important you treat your data,btohqsg
As a girl I dont understand guys,btohqsg
Hahaha. It isn't when your data is totally gone. Like legit pictures 10 years ago.,btohqsg
Any data loss on my lesson materials is a big blow. I spent 10 years+ on them,btohqsg
tbh maybe that's good. i'd rather die in blissful ignorance,btohqsg
as a guy  i don't understand guys either,btohqsg
why do you have someones backs as wallpaper,btohqsg
Invest in a good antivirus as well,btohqsg
Windows Defender has been proven to be sufficiently good,btohqsg
BUT HE IS MY GAMIN IDOL LOL,btohqsg
Anti virus don't cheapskate go install enterprise version.,btohqsg
End up wanna uninstall cannot. Cuz need their pw.,btohqsg
ok trust me  the more you learn  the less straightforward or logical it gets LOL,btohqsg
that's why everything backed up. Ransom ware  I just change a new comp,btohqsg
Although it has improved a lot,btohqsg
ever since the before CNY incident that both HDDs can fail  I got multiple backups,btohqsg
don't go to the dark side,btohqsg
Nice  make sure to air gap them,btohqsg
When I have more budget  I will do chain NAS. Use NAS to backup NAS,btohqsg

side note but my friend sent this to me,btohqsg
Any resemblance to real persons  living or dead  is purely coincidental.,btohqsg
