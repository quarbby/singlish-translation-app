Maybe next time book bike also wan tag along lol,btohqsg
Hi any old bird can teach my friend how to do,btohqsg
Delivered but no pay money how ?,btohqsg
Anyone got this order before.The client book for lalamove service to deliver durian and they also insisted to follow their SOP to take photo with timestamp and location and whatapp them individually to their mobile.The job was completed as per delivery route. However after the job is done. They deny payment till today since last night.They mentioned the durian was drop and they not willing to pay for the courier fees,btohqsg
As per lala help desk they inform that for cash order should be the client who book the service to pay and not completing the job then collect money.Lala helpdesk inform to make a police report before they can investigate.Lala help desk try to call them but the client rejected Lala call,btohqsg
Anyone did this job before? Is a close door mini mart located inside a condo at yishun,btohqsg
Don't think too much just report police and move on la  unless u really dropped the durian lol,btohqsg
Durian so many pattern.. not new issue.. good luck to the newbie doing. Never kena never learn.. so must learn hard way. Next time they will think twice b4 taking low fees job and such..,btohqsg
Can  within 2hr immediate collect within 4hr immediate 1st drop lor.,btohqsg
These pooling orders make me sleepy. Waste time  stay home relax better.,btohqsg
Dun entertain this kind. I suspect this is food for break fast for Muslim. Somemore want pooling.,btohqsg
Let those so in need have them  eventually they also toh.,btohqsg
Either u play by 4 hour or get them to change to regular.. Break fast is abt 7.15pm and most likely need to deliver by that time.,btohqsg
Durian orders  call them to confirm if they going pay first else ask them to cancel.,btohqsg
I as a Muslim am ashamed bro. Till now duwan cancel order,btohqsg
Cannot blame them  pooling does not state that the delivery is not immediate  it just says that matching takes longer.,btohqsg
Yes I accidentally drop but that does constitute they deny payment.,btohqsg
Hi I was the one who took the job but is this consider low fare?,btohqsg
To me its still low fare after deductions and total 5 drops. I dk for others. Plus if its a cash order and stated collect cash icon from sender  u should collect the payment 1st b4 proceeding for the delivery. Cheers.,btohqsg
Sorry boss I newbie sorry to affect the community,btohqsg
Must see the chat bro. Heart pain,btohqsg
If u dropped the durian  then even if u received the payment. LLM will make u cough out the compensation for the damaged goods.,btohqsg
Yes I am aware but the morale of the story they evading payment and lala helpdesk to call them but they reject lala call,btohqsg
Oh ya..u might be right..i didn't think of that..,btohqsg
I'm also a Muslim so dun worry üòÅ.  U try order this home based business and see how much they charge for delivery. Easy2 15 dollars or above.When consumer complain about this HBB delivery charges  they not happy and some went to the extend of viral. As much  I totally understand from these HBB that they want to save cost.But ironically when this HBB ppl call for delivery  they choose the most cheapest app. ü§£ Deliver food somemore. Delay become delivery ppl problem.Then like that we rider/driver can viral their cheapskate delivery mode anot? üíÜ,btohqsg
True.. this got nothing to do with religion.. its humans & everyone in singapore wants cheap.. but when comes to they go dine food outside they dont mind paying alot... just the facts. But transportation all want ls cheap...,btohqsg
this job rly need follow procedure. I do as what they say with time stamp  They Transfer My delivery fee very quickly. Any case  just follow procedures,btohqsg
Halo guys please  it's raining why I see people still taking order with low fare calm down lah let's the fare increase for awhile.. haiya,btohqsg
What to do Bro? Too many newbies on the road.,btohqsg
They mentioned they will pay me yesterday but till now not paid yet,btohqsg
Till now hevnt receive and keep prompting but no response,btohqsg
I asked for payment before but they kept insisting will pay after done and seems legitimate given they hve pop up store in a condominium,btohqsg
Becareful if anyone receive ya  it's a condo in Yishun miltonia residences  if they don't pay me I'm going head down to settle and report police on it too,btohqsg
Hope your case can be resolved soonüôè,btohqsg
Call the cops from there. Make a scene so neighbours can know. Make it big as possible in a gentlemanly manner.,btohqsg
