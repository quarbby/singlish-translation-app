Mornings guys. For citi credit card  I have applied giro payment in may and received text from hsbc that the auto debit is set up successfully. But on Citibank credit card statement I don‚Äôt see giro payment like scb credit card statement do.,btohqsg
But mine is like set up in Jun 7th. Already 1 month ago‚Ä¶,btohqsg
It will typically come into effect 2 or 3 billing cycles. It needs approval from both banks.,btohqsg
Need 2-3 months for it to fully setup n GIRO appear on your bill.,btohqsg
Thanks  I should wait on citi side I guess. I received an email from citi saying that my giro payment is approved and it is an eAdvice. Let me find it on citi mobile. Thank you guys!,btohqsg
It is that I set up giro payment for scb and citi tgt and scb already use giro payments‚Ä¶ citi so slowüòÖ,btohqsg
So I assume that I can the entire bill circle after 30/06 will be giro payment?,btohqsg
The final confirmation is to always read your bill  which should explicitly state that payment will be made via GIRO,btohqsg

Am I going to sign up for SC smart credit card  who wants referral me?,btohqsg
Long story short. To get max benefits from moomoo promo  just deposit and subscribe in $2k four times and on fifth time deposit at least $2k up to either 30k or $80k.If the 1st four + fifth deposit is minimum $10k  then u will unlock the lower cap 30k  30-day 5.8% and your timer will start immediately.If the 1st four + fifth deposit is minimum $50k  then u will unlock the higher cap $80k  30-day 5.8% and your timer will start immediately.The 2 qualifying funds are:Fullerton SGD cash fundCSOP USD money market fund,btohqsg
Ayo what??? That's a nice hack thanks!,btohqsg
So your fifth deposit determines which coupon u will get. This is very important.And since 30 day count down will start immediately after u qualify  u need to keep and maintain the amount for the max.If let‚Äôs say u deposit in 10k today then your 30day timer starts  then say after 3 weeks u left with about 7 days and decide to subscribe 20k.Ah your 20k will get 5.8% but only for the last 7 day‚Äôs remaining of the timer.I very headache now coz MooMoo say it‚Äôs limited time and encourage me to sign up fast. But then  this month bonus month. So if sign up now  I can‚Äôt park my bonus to earn higher interest.I contemplating waiting till bonus is out the 1 shot do the strategy.,btohqsg
Anyone has city index referral. Pm me. Will use whoever give me first. üòä,btohqsg
this strategy is for the $30k 5 trades... for the $50k 7 trades  it will only start on 7th subscription?,btohqsg
if i subscribe 2 separate times in one day that is counted as 2 trades right?,btohqsg
FYI  latest 6 months T bills cut off yield at 3.99%!,btohqsg
I think you can wait it out. Campaign ends on 31 August so if you do it in August they should still honour the 30 day guaranteed yield,btohqsg
The 5 trades is any trade for buy sell equity or unit trust also ok,btohqsg
Or u are saying by subscribing to the cash fund already qualify?,btohqsg
do note this fine print:In the event of negative yields for seven consecutive days  the position in any of the funds invested will be liquidated.,btohqsg
Money market fund also can incurred loss  it is investment instrument  just lower risk,btohqsg
This are not fix deposit which is principle guarantee,btohqsg
any idea if I can top up grab with instarem + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Can top up     but no rewards from CRMC and u pay a 2% fee LOL,btohqsg
so even pay 2% no 4mpd,btohqsg
