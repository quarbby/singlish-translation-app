Either fight to survive or sink,btohqsg
I do lala also do during free time. Got fare is more then enough alr.,btohqsg
Sometimes we cannot fault those who take it. But I agree with your opinion. That‚Äôs why they are called scavengers. Gives the other drivers opportunity to take those better trips after. I have even resulted to stacking orders. Coz if they don‚Äôt care  why should I? ü§£,btohqsg
That's what I said... fight it or die only..,btohqsg
I totally understand Bro. I never detest your opinion. üòá,btohqsg
No la.. I just saying only,btohqsg
So if anyone of you have to fill up the form next time  you now know the reason.,btohqsg

Hello all... Wanted to ask for some opinions esp the full timers.I did Lalamove last year and could manage ~20-30/hr. Heard now it's been on a downtrend? Wanted to ask whether it's still worth to do dispatch for llm,btohqsg
Cause there was always high demand surcharge during lunch and dinner,btohqsg
During peak surcharge... Go town and wait to stack. Maximize the waiting time of 30mins.,btohqsg
Non peak u can take multistop. Then stack along the way,btohqsg
What's the hourly rate now? On average ?,btohqsg
I heard lala lwoered the base fare lol,btohqsg
net meaning like minus the estimated maintenance parking petrol etc,btohqsg
Gross.. but still depends on individual or how chiong,btohqsg
ahh ok thanks so much for sharing :),btohqsg
Guys if round trip they should add in the return address also right?,btohqsg
thats if they don't add round trip and it becomes a multi stop,btohqsg
round trip is $4 and ur return address is the pickup location,btohqsg
Already stated round trip. So $8 is included in Ur fare bk to pu,btohqsg
I‚Äôve done round trip before and this i guess makes more sense and worth the trip üòÖ,btohqsg
This one more worth it then the other one u sent. Cos the customer didn't put the pickup point as drop-off.,btohqsg
Yes I guess that should be the way for round trip. If it‚Äôs just 2 stops then when you arrive and pick up at 2nd stop the app when tell you to complete your trip instead of telling you to proceed to return to your 1st stop,btohqsg
Guess this is some of the loopholes that benefit the client and not us,btohqsg
ü§∑ it's lalamove with stupid customers,btohqsg
Hi all I‚Äôm really new to this what does it mean click and collect ?,btohqsg
Click and collect counter at the drop off point store.,btohqsg
Its gettin out of hand haaisss,btohqsg
is it me or orders are getting lesser? maybe cuz of june holidays üòÖ,btohqsg
For motor ok. But price totally nonsense.,btohqsg
Jurong go kaki bukit  $17 before comission,btohqsg
Too bad people still take... Prices are not going back up anytime soon,btohqsg
$10 + $10 mileage + $10 high demand surcharge,btohqsg
No more already. Just now i saw $17.,btohqsg
Maybe this one during peak hour,btohqsg
I go Somerset to jurong point $14 pls..,btohqsg

i dun dare take cus i scared dk where park,btohqsg
I don have to park  I walker LOL,btohqsg
