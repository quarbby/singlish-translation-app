Why you changing lane when it’s not safe,btohqsg
My friend wants to sell his COE Avante. He sells at Carousell but no good offers. He thinks to sell as direct owner at car mart. What is the pro and con?,btohqsg
Apparently it is safe but it still beeps,btohqsg
Actually signal before change lane pls.,btohqsg
Once you signal the lane keep assist will not sound.,btohqsg
Ppl will low ball u. U will get endless calls from dealers,btohqsg
So what is your suggestion?He wants to sell with market or slightly slower than market price. Definitely not dealer take in price haha,btohqsg
Because he is not buying car anymore.,btohqsg
Just sell to dealer and get over w it,btohqsg
Delay more  value go down more,btohqsg
Yes that is his main concern,btohqsg
Those very low quotes are usually dealers,btohqsg
If dun need car  leave it with a trusted dealer to consign,btohqsg

Im considering between used civic vs mazda 6 for 2017 models. Any views?,btohqsg
i would say mazda 6 mainly because it is a luxury sedan. higher class than civic but if u want sporty  then civic is a good choice,btohqsg
Civic 1.5T or 1.6NA? Mz6 interior better. Pick up slow. If u want Fast and fun drive  Civic.,btohqsg
Yes 1.5T civic vs 2.0 mazda6,btohqsg
In terms of engine reliability? I hv nightmare with mazda 5 gearbox previously.,btohqsg
2l road tax vs 1.5l road tax,btohqsg
Would Cat B civic OPC worth it?,btohqsg
A bit too ex. Could hv got a tucson,btohqsg

The 2l M6 is a guzzler,btohqsg
If u are a high mileage driver  prepare to svs Civic more regular. 7k km I would get notification for svs,btohqsg
1.5t civic still can do a decent 10-11,btohqsg
Not much different civic and mz6 fc,btohqsg
How about fc? My current sylphy damm sucks. Maybe 8km per litre,btohqsg
That's bad. How old? I only know Hyundai matrix could achieve that fc,btohqsg
How bad ur fc is dependent on ur foot - HOM,btohqsg
My previous Q7 2.0T can do 8-9km/l. Your foot must be very heavy or car always full capacity and a lot of city driving.,btohqsg
My VRS does 8-8.5 mostly traffic and lots of lights haha,btohqsg

The car is meant to go north and back,btohqsg
