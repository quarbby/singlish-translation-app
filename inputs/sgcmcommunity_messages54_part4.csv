I would think its actually a good time to sell and buy a higher value 2nd hand car. Yes sell high  buy high but you get higher parf at the end for your new car,btohqsg
"But definitely not good to sell and ""downgrade"" to lower value new car",btohqsg
best time to buy will always be low Coe period... no need think too much... old car bring more worries,btohqsg
Of cos of cos... Just saying with the current coe  best to buy high value 2nd hand car,btohqsg
Imagine buying a 120k new car with arf of say 25-30kCompare to a old car with 5-6years to go and arf of 80k also costing 120k.Monthly will be similar  maybe old car a bit more (1 2 year less) but you get back more at the end. And you get more comfort driving.Then theres the old car  maintenance issues  etc.....,btohqsg
there are still a few undervalued cars in the market,btohqsg
good time to sell and buy those cars,btohqsg
when all this big germans go to 4 pot,btohqsg

STI will rise because now subie not making,btohqsg
Got mid range undervalued car anot,btohqsg
cars like clio rs  megane rs,btohqsg
all this car are niche but will forever have demand because supply is low,btohqsg
I define cars by arf value,btohqsg
Mid to me will be around 80k arf,btohqsg
that one ex liao no meh,btohqsg
some coe cars can maintain its value very well,btohqsg
I mean there's 100k and above,btohqsg
so what kind of cars you talking abt,btohqsg
Sold my 15 year old car for 39kBgouht a 5 year old car at 120k with arf of 85k.,btohqsg
No those actually have slightly lower arf and higher depreciation,btohqsg
Anyway it's just my view on the current situation. Others can have their own views on what's best,btohqsg
