My student said she died for a-math,btohqsg
ok wtf every other yr before us the paper was so damn easy and then,btohqsg
Quite is actually quite striaght forward although it rephase in a different way,btohqsg
whats the last part ans ah,btohqsg
Cb they all give so complicated eqns,btohqsg
I losing more than 20 marks,btohqsg
Lol I was so close and then time ran out oof,btohqsg
Maybe A1 will be like 75,btohqsg
But I think the maximum it will drop is to 80,btohqsg
Sian if A1 cannot get then A2,btohqsg
Y'all worrying about A I wanna pass,btohqsg
My classmate still thinks its 85,btohqsg
Hais paper 1 was great then suddenly they decided to give us cancer for paper 2,btohqsg
Wow paper 2 rape us so hard,btohqsg
I did tys since like 2012 year and this was definitely the hardest paper 2 I have seen for2012-2019,btohqsg
Just hope paper 1 pull all the way,btohqsg
Even tanjong katong prelim am not even as shiong as this,btohqsg
A hard paper is a good chance to prove yourself,btohqsg
They ask us to put in certain form,btohqsg
Most of the qn i found was very doable,btohqsg
What's the problem with that thou,btohqsg
The few qns I could do,btohqsg
So it will go down after that,btohqsg
I mean if u understand not really,btohqsg
I cannot even get the equation,btohqsg
Bruh I got careless mistake took me 20 mins to find it,btohqsg
I anyhow do got 14 13,btohqsg
huh it was easier than my this year prelim,btohqsg
yea i got this too for the coord of c right,btohqsg
Bruh my brain took so long to process,btohqsg
the diagram is needed bc u need to see whether its +ve or -ve,btohqsg
what was ur explanation on why the diagram is necessary?,btohqsg
2 values of x  need to see which one to use,btohqsg
how many marks did yâ€™all lose alrd;-;,btohqsg
Has the answers come out yet?,btohqsg
the linear law also dk what to say,btohqsg
I wrote 2035 bc i rounded up,btohqsg
I think my gradient wrong lol,btohqsg
4 cos of blank  but careless prolly alot more T-T,btohqsg
Wait what is the base year for the no of years,btohqsg
If gradient wrong will have ecf rite,btohqsg
I thought first yr of the interval so though 2030 isnt when it hit 8 mill but within that interval it hit 8 mil alr??,btohqsg
I think I lost like 20+ marks,btohqsg
Since paper 1 I did well hopefully an get A2,btohqsg
This year paper so hard I would say maybe around 85 A1 then,btohqsg
I put 2031 cos one bar on the x axis is 1/3 years,btohqsg
They say first yr of the interval,btohqsg
Imagine if tmr is gonna be as bad,btohqsg
Same I got the gradient wrong got ecf rite,btohqsg
idk theres like a range of and,btohqsg
