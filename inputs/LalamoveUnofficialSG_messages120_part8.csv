Lol... 3 small fans still can keep quiet but from industrial area sure those fans cannot fit in a car,btohqsg
Totally normal... people book courier expecting moto to carry more then 8kg lol,btohqsg
At first I thought only telegrams groups got low ballers. Lalamove have plenty too lol,btohqsg
See this so pathetic fare yet so demanding. No wonder nobody take,btohqsg
are the fares set by LLM or the senders dictate the price?,btohqsg
Sender can dictate also if Iâ€™m not wrong,btohqsg
Seriously fck all these low-ball senders man. I drive a car and they want me to deliver a TV.I understand now why they never provide any details in the job description.Please read carefully first guys before accepting jobs.,btohqsg
Don't accept jobs if there's no description provided,btohqsg
I believe sender can manipulate the fares.. if not you wonâ€™t see lowball fares everyday.. also llm bot system to dictate fare isnâ€™t fair. They donâ€™t take into consideration jam  erp  no parking  easy summon areas,btohqsg
That's why people is cheapo thanks to gst hike oso,btohqsg
You kana before what happened ?,btohqsg
Yeah some are so cocky and full of themselves,btohqsg
For me I only do food for llm so wonâ€™t encounter all these negative attitude ppl,btohqsg
Just tell them donâ€™t be rude if not happy donâ€™t use llm,btohqsg
