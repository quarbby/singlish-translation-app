Like we girls ..when we dress up and make up .. we mostly just do it quietly our self and surprise people or let people judge for themselves. We don't keep showing how we dress up or make up unless different type of girls. Anyway thats my personal thoughts only .. not against anyone . Sorry hehehe,btohqsg
