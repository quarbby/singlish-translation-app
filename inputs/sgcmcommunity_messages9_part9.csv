Wanna ask like which car dealership is trusted in sg,btohqsg
Planning to purchase my first car. Definitely second hand cause looking at the current coe cannot make it. I use motorbike now so the price gap is huge. Need find trusted shop to buy from,btohqsg
You're at the right group but I'll leave the others to suggest but I've always bought second hand unlike my sister and nary a lemon in them whereas the new stuff for whatever reasons have odd lights from the dashboard coming on and going off.,btohqsg
Hard..very few. Even big names have black sheep. But can get tips on how not to get fleeced though,btohqsg
Agreed. My previous 2 rides bought second hand also. Both dealer cmi  2nd 1 also big names also. Pretty hard to get a problem free car. Surely got some issue here and there.,btohqsg
Buy from owner straight may solve this issue though got possibility got issue but usually buy from dealer de got issue de lah if not why sell in a way HAHA,btohqsg
When I trade in my car  my car was problem free,btohqsg
5 years old and not giving me any problems,btohqsg
good lah but u wont know until the other owner bought it haha,btohqsg
Since the rest aren't giving much of of an encouragement  the first car I bought was a Renault. Lasted me through 10 years. Then I bought a Toyota Camry from a private owner  and I did consider extending after 10 years because it ran perfectly. Then a Honda jazz also from an owner then a Mazda 3 (my least fav) But get modifications in contract written in and initialed. Maybe get a mechanic to take a look at it before you buy. If you want  I can ask a mechanic friend to come with you for a fee. Hope you know how to speak mandarin!,btohqsg
Even if you get recommendations here  you can't be sure that the recommender is not the agent or affiliated,btohqsg
And the agent you eventually approach  you can't be sure the model you're interested in  happens to be a problematic one that they are trying to get rid of.,btohqsg
But you test drive the ones you want only when you've settled on final 2 then you bring in mechanic.,btohqsg
Yah...any agent that disagrees or grumbles  walk away even if you really want it. Unless you dun mind paying another few k like the merc buyer in news recently,btohqsg
Used car is like a box of chocolate,btohqsg
LoL and you're gonna get worms in most of them üòÇ,btohqsg
Car times taught me that real well lol,btohqsg
I kinda disagree. There are second hand agencies with discernment and passion that what they are doing is a service.,btohqsg
Dun count of the 6 month lemon thing. Buy a car with a small over head budget like 3 to 5 k to shake down the car. It goes a long way.  It‚Äôs harder then it seem. But you don‚Äôt know how the previous owner take care of their car and that has little to do with the dealer.,btohqsg
I think for a start  look for 1st owner type  mileage below 16k per year (just a guide  cos those below 10k a year are likely tampered)  got rare gems are really below 10k cos work home drive only,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why people usually will go for single owner  Low mileage and preferable with agent warranty left plus agent service record,btohqsg
Dun get their package i.e. sound system etc  get it done outside. Join that model's chat group and understand more and research more so you can expect what issues to face,btohqsg
If dun mind spend a bit can send for sta evaluation. That u will know if the car has some accidents. The paint work dun lie,btohqsg
Lol agent warranty usually cover engine  gear and another  but wear and tear is you cover ownself  so it's better to get to know the ws your chat group frequents. The agent's workshop usually can't solve most problems or recommend expensive fixes,btohqsg
But small accident can‚Äôt be help Over the life span of a car usage. Just hope not the overly big ones,btohqsg
If you have budget constraint  the most you allow is 2 owner.,btohqsg
Ya. Part of buying used cars,btohqsg
But we all agree when we sell car. Other than wanting a better one. Usually there are signs that motivate you to change also ü§≠,btohqsg
Most important is dun rush lol take your time,btohqsg
"@sgcarmartpardon me saying here  the cars marked sold  are not necessarily ""sold""  if you know what I mean. So some figures I suspect is marked up through churning.",btohqsg
I suggest whichever merchant that mark sold  ask them for lta papers to prove.,btohqsg
"I.e. customer dun wan to sell anymore  next day listing shows ""sold""",btohqsg
Even sgcarmart's star merchant award I treat it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Telegram has this timer thing these days,btohqsg
LoL prevent spamming like I did üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya. And it dun allow me to send paste message,btohqsg
Is it a iPhone thing or telegram as a whole,btohqsg
Heh. Last type my good advise lol,btohqsg
Buy used car is not a bad thing. Dealer also just a middle man. Expectation must be right. See car that time make sure can bring it out for a short spin. Especially for dual cluth vehicle,btohqsg
Problems can tell in either Low speed or hi revs. shifting gear out of park  reverse drive and the other way round. Make sure no sound and vibration,btohqsg
Hi Rev maybe harder to test without open road. But flood cars usually will have problems in that region when u will get ecu error and power is lost. These are hidden problems that will come down to affect normal driving,btohqsg
"I bought a 12 year car. Spent abt $4K+ on wear & tear stuff. I prefer preventive maintenance rather than workshop's recommendation of ""no need to replace now  save $$  can use until it breaks down""....",btohqsg
I also look for smell in the car. Overly cover with scented stuff i tend to think trying to cover up something. Smoker car usually still ok if you also smoker. But previous owner does his smoking is in the car. Those tend to stay in there for a long time as it‚Äôs all into the roof lining and circulation system. Also u can‚Äôt smell the moudy smell signs of water leakage or flood car if it‚Äôs cover by aroma,btohqsg
Make sure no low fuel nonsense that cannot go too far. Make the agent top up. And take note of the chassis number that you are satisfied with after the spin.,btohqsg
Leather condition also. Not to hiam the leather old or crack. Can always rewrap it. But it‚Äôs about how the owner maintain the vehicle.,btohqsg
"True. I will not buy one if the car is ""trying to smell good with artificial aroma"". I dislike car perfumes personally.",btohqsg
But better to get your own outside  cos whatever price you reduce after bargaining with agent  they'll cover back from the so called packages,btohqsg
I prefer the natural smell of old leather seats. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Ya. Buy old car   budgeting better have a bit left over to zhng or shake down. Depend on model and individual need,btohqsg
Ah ya  I remembered  dun change anything. That's the key. Wanna change  do it outside with your own preferred vendor.,btohqsg
