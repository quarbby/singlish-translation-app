Are they going to be at the travel fare this month? Maybe can get freebies plus miles using the right card,btohqsg
yes! haha the natas fare  we will be doing our payment there too  so if i sign up card there.. i dont think i can immediately use the card too 😅 can only use my existing cards and get the freebies. still considering if i should get UOB lady's 😭,btohqsg
Uob lady is a decent card to get. If u see u spend frequently on ur chosen category.,btohqsg
It’s free to apply. Just apply and decide later. Maybe can split bill there,btohqsg
"thinking if i should choose travel as my bonus since im going to be paying a lot on the natas fare  but on a usual basis i dont travel. AND if i choose travel  i dont even know if UOB lady consider me paying to ASA holiday agency under the ""travel category"". i cant seem to find it when in researching so.. hais its ok 😂 thanks for replying me 🥰",btohqsg
At least for UOB lady travel  you can appeal if UOB doesn't recognize it as travel agency. I read people appealing for flight tix that wasnt registered as airlines in UOB system.,btohqsg
NATAS fair and ASA  are under mcc 7991 and are not under Lady bonus category. Quite a number of people kena this trap. Some appeal successfully n some failed. Hence  not advise to use Lady on NATAS and ASA.,btohqsg
A better option will be using UOB PPV(max $1.1k)  or VS(min $1k  max $2k) n pay viamobile contactless.,btohqsg
i see! thanks so much!@antonio191203thanks too haha i will consider 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Any idea how much is your travel package or airticket?,btohqsg
oh big sum man  my whole family adding up to like 33k to be paid on that day so i wanna max out my credit card but only have citirewards ahaha. let me look into UOB PPV and VS 🙏 thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Is booking car rental through Klook counted for UOB Lady travel category?,btohqsg
yes.. because booked under Klook merchant,btohqsg
Yes. Book theater show on klook is also counted for travel. 😉,btohqsg
Option A: Citi rewards max $1k if linked n pay via Amaze card.Best is to let the travel agent know you will split the payment into few month using multiple cards. Pay the first payment $1k using Amaze + CRMC  UOB PPV n VS: $1.1k + $2k(mobile contactless)It will take you 12 months to settle the bills by visiting the travel agent monthly based on your credit card miles reset date.Option B: apply UOB Krisflyer card and payvia Kris+ you will get 3+1 miles for all $33k provided you have $33k credit limit. Remember to transfer Kris+ miles to Krisflyer account asap after the transaction.,btohqsg
Anyone facing issue to log in ichange?,btohqsg
Citi reward exclude travel mcc for bonus point. Uob krisflyer via kris+ after other card max out is best,btohqsg
oh   i mean the reward/point per transaction  like the one in oub app,btohqsg
Unfortunately no. U gotta use their website. And it's horrible. 😢,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if I am going to replace my uob evol with uob one cc  should I wait till aug 1 or just apply now?,btohqsg
apply now  first quarter is prorated,btohqsg
First quarter prorated meaning? My uob statement is after July ends,btohqsg
if apply now  first quarter should be Jul to Sep. For first quarter  can meet tiered spending and min 5 transactions in Aug and Sep statement months and get 2/3 of the quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
Means July don’t need spend ? I reckon by the time I receive the card it will be August. Thanks for replying 🙏,btohqsg
And do I tell them to change my Aug statement from start of Aug to end of Aug once my card is approved?,btohqsg
up to u. Can also meet spend for Sep statement and get 1/3 of quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
Snack insurance April promotion voucher is here,btohqsg
If I paywave directly with UOB kf  can earn 3mpd? Given already hit 800 on SIA,btohqsg
Is it worth to place FD in USD currency then covert interest earned back to SGD? May I know how much is the estimated calculation administration or service charges,btohqsg
How to pay the $8 snack premium in a single top up so that can complete the rest of the challenges ?Hi queen,btohqsg
U need to link card to snack and open your lifestyle activites for insurance and spend on the card link to it,btohqsg
That’s the only way is it. So cannot just make $8 payment in a single payment ?,btohqsg
Nope  each activities more max 70 cent subject to your weekly cap,btohqsg
Wah until now snack still have ya? Meaning not many people participate,btohqsg
I pay until more than $12 😟,btohqsg
Coz sometime the spend track sometime dont,btohqsg
hey guys anyone able to login to chocolate finance?,btohqsg

Can top up $162 in investment then open the 5% allocation to insurance. It will fulfill the $8.,btohqsg
