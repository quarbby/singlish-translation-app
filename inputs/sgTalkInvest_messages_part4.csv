Bro  you sure you wanna trade crypto when you aren't even familiar with exchanges? No offense ah. Perhaps can save you some moolah here...,btohqsg
well i just need to know if the exchange is merely a facility that lets the investor itself do the trading,btohqsg
or is it only that the investor puts money n the trader or bot does the trading?,btohqsg
U are suppose to trade yourself,btohqsg
Like stock exchange  you open account  go in buy and sell stocks. In your current case  crypto instead of stocks,btohqsg
hmmm somehow everyone here who msgs me offer me only packages whereby i put money n allow them to trade for me on my behalf,btohqsg
everyone says they can be trusted n have a team of trusted professionals or bots,btohqsg
where can i find such an exchange?,btohqsg
U give them u prepare get scammed,btohqsg
Correct! Someone paid $500 and the person uncontactable after that,btohqsg
many of those cases here huh?,btohqsg
It's the internet. Scams are everywhere. It's even more rampant when it comes to platforms such as telegram which is keeps the identity of the user secret.,btohqsg
You don't even know who you are talking to and you want to put your $$ with them.,btohqsg
is there a forex/crypto forum or platform online whereby there r many online discussions on this subject? so that we know the different risks we as investors r looking at?,btohqsg
okay  let me provide you the answer..answer is your brain is the best exchange and your eyes the best trader,btohqsg
Dont so bad la kick ppl,btohqsg
haizzzz everyday listen to these templated hardshell messages also damn sick of it... even if not scam also sound like selling fake snake oil with these sentence structure: A+B+CA<oh you can earn ?% of profitz in ?dayz and ?weekz...>B<...start with only $xxx dollarz...>C<... PM meeeee for more detailz! Only seriouz goonduz should contact me>like being spammed,btohqsg
Why all my qns never receive any replies de? No details how to invest sia ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ they really expect us to ÈÄÅ‰∏äÈó®ÂêóÔºü,btohqsg
"hahahahah .... dunno sia... probably their baiting is scripted in ""if-else"" loop sales tactic... like when you dial a call centre or chat bot for service... anything u say out of their scripted logic does not grant you answers.... if the seller cannot answer to your expectation.... move on bah",btohqsg
gf different la ... gf for marrying or otherwise?,btohqsg
But marry already isn't it worse?,btohqsg
IMHO ... see the GF for a potential mate for life is totally different from love... may not even be more or less sextisfaction... maybe from small faults and misgivings that grow into larger deafening silences bah... if GF cannot be life-long mate... then no point to marry (not just for the sake of the HDB flat),btohqsg
Haha. How to boot these bots,btohqsg
How did a convo on chatbot become a discussion on marriage. ü§£,btohqsg
dunno sia.... JJ asked and i answered... sorry if it's out of topic in this group LOL ... i shall stop answering on this topic LOL,btohqsg
Lol dun really care. Better than all the PM me for quick rich schemes here..,btohqsg
i will also ÈÄÅ... hahaha... probably only way to sniff out these scammers LOL,btohqsg
Chat bot Liao lor. Sniff already also can't do anything,btohqsg
luckily AI has not evolved so high yet... LOL,btohqsg
for now just happy with somebody calling and asking for DHL delivery and Police or Tax evasion,btohqsg
Bro actually marriage is also an investment,btohqsg
Like my useless friend who married a richer girl,btohqsg
Den made use of the girl's dad to enter his company,btohqsg
paiseh.... i never thought of it this way bah.... kekeke...  but good for him to marry a rich girl and move up....,btohqsg
Den moved into her dad house n leech,btohqsg
The guy didn't lose anything n is happy,btohqsg
"Hi bro to start off: any ""MLM"" schemes in crypto is a scam..u control ur own trading of ur own cryptocurrency not a platform or pattern trading of some sorts..if approached by such ventures stayaway.tradingof crypto is always done in the different exchanges u put ur coins to not by leveraging or binary platform.dont get burned please",btohqsg
Sucks for the girl though. Haha,btohqsg
He must be damn good looking guy since he has no assets.. Or a super sweet talker ü§îü§î good riddance for the girl then. What a spineless leech!,btohqsg
In business we call it cut loss!,btohqsg
Very ugly but he good at talking nonsense,btohqsg
Ah  the sweet talker type. Maybe the girl also Â§¥ËÑëËøõÊ∞¥ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
Put yourself in his shoes would you have done same thing? Lol.,btohqsg
Anyway marrying into a rich family can be stressful too especially when u got no leverage.,btohqsg
Too extreme already. He even extort money from his kids saying if they can't get A  need to give him money,btohqsg
Or the give him money bit was lost in context,btohqsg
He's also very stingy. He will walk 5 bus stops to save 50 centd,btohqsg
No lor. If yes  I would have married a rich spouse liao. Right? Lol,btohqsg
There are people who can cope and Ê≠ª‰∏çË¶ÅËÑ∏ÈÇ£ÁßçÔºåÊúâÊ≤°Êúâ,btohqsg
