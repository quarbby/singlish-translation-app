How do you chase an agency for ur salary,btohqsg
Its been almost a week and they fucking grey ticked me,btohqsg
I need help on this pls,btohqsg
you should report to the authority lol,btohqsg
yasia like there's a law for employees rights protection,btohqsg
Nope it was a one day job i got through an agency  I worked alr but agency said they gon pay me soon up till now havent yet,btohqsg
they should pay you first maan,btohqsg
A few days ago they said they gon give but up till now havent give,btohqsg
did you checked if the account number is the same??,btohqsg
I wld give less shits if my crush did this to me but i need money,btohqsg
Look at me chasing them lol,btohqsg
worse case scenario  they send to another person instead of you,btohqsg
They didnt even ask for my bank acc or wtv even though thats what they said abt salary collection,btohqsg
Im gna try chasing them agn the next work week but if i dont successfully get my deserved pay what shld i do,btohqsg
yaa that is the likely situation here,btohqsg
or go to the agency and demands why they didn't pay you,btohqsg
because it is likely that the agency pays not the client,btohqsg
i believe recruit first might forgot the kinda thing,btohqsg
im not sure they dont seems to be the type to do that shit on purpose,btohqsg
i see their job listings everywhere,btohqsg
maan i did worked for them twice,btohqsg
but ermm i hate them the fact that they redirect the job to something else,btohqsg
like i did applied for admin,btohqsg
and when i go see their office  they asked me to take up a job in gardern by the bay instead,btohqsg
so yaa i hate that part,btohqsg
like something to do with the children's water park,btohqsg
like you just stand there and watch for ill behaviour,btohqsg
tbh ya most recruit agencies do this,btohqsg
but the female manager always give you trouble shit,btohqsg
you can't actually stands  you need to do something,btohqsg
Its pretty much what they do,btohqsg
mhm@meltedmangofrappereporting threatens their licenses and all so they will listen immediately,btohqsg
inform them that report sent to mom too,btohqsg
u will prob get it eventually,btohqsg
sometimes the agent is too busy contacting and messaging other ppl most of the time,btohqsg
idk la i got grey ticked even tho they usu reply damn fast,btohqsg
Apparently the limit is 7days  after which u can file a complaint with TADM,btohqsg
Kid on the bus call me uncle,btohqsg
Means my eyebags and health become like old person alr,btohqsg
I having less than a quarter life crisis ;-;,btohqsg

I feel so short whenever my cousins come over :(,btohqsg
Then my anxiety came up and I'm like hiding rn,btohqsg
