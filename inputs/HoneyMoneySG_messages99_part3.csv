Don't know if this was mentioned before.. but I just want to contribute a little knowledge to the helpful community here. Apply for a trust account if you're a frequent traveller. The exchange rate is almost the same as what you see on Google. No additional charges etc.,btohqsg

Does this mean no more 1% cashback on credit card giro payments?,btohqsg
me too...every month $500 in...sigh so sad it's nerfed,btohqsg
Why the T&C like contradicting their website one...https://www.hsbc.com.sg/help/important-notices/,btohqsg
Seems like the same. Which part contradicting?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185727,btohqsg
Yup.. but says the same thing.. it's not saying 2 opposite things also 😅,btohqsg
the website version could mean only crypto/stock related is excluded,btohqsg
T&CPayments made to financial institutions  securities brokerages or dealers (including but not limited to the trading of securities  investments or crypto-currencies of any kind) (Clause 5b)WebsitePayments to any financial institute and trading platforms relating to crypto-currencies  stock exchange and trades.==Seems like website seem to say A&B that deals with XYZ. T&C seem to say A&B (including but not limited to XYZ),btohqsg
Actually both are accurate. See CSO reply:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185727,btohqsg
well  it is open to interpretation what they really mean,btohqsg

Any idea how does the new moomoo 6.8% work?I have 20k in the cashplus now. Do I need to withdraw everything first before pressing the register now? Then deposit back the 20k?,btohqsg
"Actually with CSO reply the website version is correct  but maybe because t&c add one more ""dealers"" make it sound different.",btohqsg
I quite sure eventually will block even if now it's not.,btohqsg
else the loophole still remains and I still get lots of free money monthly.,btohqsg
Can i ask which credit card which you put on giro do you guys use to pay for the other banks credit card?,btohqsg
I set up giro for each credit card..? Am I not doing it correctly? 😂,btohqsg
