Hi ! Has anyone appealed o lvl results and has recieved outcome,btohqsg
They say it‚Äôs through school then I call my school my school say end Feb tho,btohqsg
jyjyjy even tho u very noisy,btohqsg
Damn  I got the email too  but I unsubbed so long ago,btohqsg
How and why are they still sending itüíÄ,btohqsg
The kind of email I get,btohqsg
i also got the sutd open house emails even after unsubbing which is now chilling in my spam folder and im like im alr a student here bruh,btohqsg
Tell me about itüò≠ I'm getting them from SMU and SUSS too,btohqsg
Like bruh  I don't plan to go to these schoolsüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Survey answer: School placement system sucks  should have been in RJC instead of YJC,btohqsg
Their admissions and marketing office is probably separated‚úäüò£,btohqsg
in addition sutd also spam sends the promotional women in tech thing,btohqsg
Probably highlights that there aren't that many women in tech then,btohqsg
yeah their masters scholarship requirements are also quite discriminative,btohqsg
if you are a female you have a higher chance of getting it,btohqsg
It'd be better to get the masters in another country in that case,btohqsg
ye if want to take masters but currently i plan to yeet off to work after graduating,btohqsg
i wonder what is a masters degree good for tho its just extra qualifications right,btohqsg
You may have to wait a few years,btohqsg
Smth like that  and in certain companies  it either allows you to enter at a higher position,btohqsg
yea tho i dont really see the point of promoting so fast like its good to be at a higher position and earning more money also means higher spending power but the job will also be more stressful,btohqsg
Random qnIf you are close contact with someone who is positive then you have like class assignment due this Friday. And the submission is by this Friday if not you get penalised  by remodding this sem.  Fyi; I have been coughing and having high fever the whole afternoon and I haven't test myself yet cause I'm not home yet. Should I be allowed to still go school and submit my assignment  if my test is negative? But I lowkey think it's positive cause horh my chest hurts like crap.,btohqsg
but ofc each to their own if someone views career progression as important to them or just want to further their education then sure masters will prob be a good idea,btohqsg
you can ask if you can submit online,btohqsg
Need to print and drop off,btohqsg
If not I won't be so jumpy rn,btohqsg
have you emailed your teacher alr,btohqsg
It's gg 10pm and why would prof read email this late,btohqsg
yea but if not can also call school office tmr to check,btohqsg
They won't pick up aft 6,btohqsg
in contrast i have profs replying at 3am,btohqsg
but its quite chill here tbf,btohqsg
Its abt drive its abt power,btohqsg
Random qn  is it possible to tie my hair if i had a wolfcut,btohqsg
Wew can tie pony tail too?,btohqsg
But i tot can choose what kind of bangs,btohqsg
unless u braid it like from the top,btohqsg
but still ur side frames cnfm will have regardless,btohqsg
unless ur head small as hell u can somehow push all ur hair into a bun la,btohqsg
u cut wolfcut dont tell me no side bangs meh,btohqsg
when u cut will have la,btohqsg
Kinda going for this cos im bored,btohqsg
Lmao at most just let it grow out again,btohqsg
U ASK ME CAN TIE HAIR UP OR NOT,btohqsg
THIS ONE U TELL ME CAN ANNOT,btohqsg
unless ur forehead is 10 inch,btohqsg
I mean it looks like a tail??,btohqsg
Soo i cant ponytail a mullet,btohqsg
Are wolfcuts only for thin hair... üôÉ,btohqsg
Indeed  but many people value money over personal time ig,btohqsg
Let's have a cup of coffee together,btohqsg
Oh free expresso! dont mind if i do :),btohqsg
Why wolfcut when you can get a mullet,btohqsg
Idk if mullet will make my hair poky,btohqsg
Only one way to find out,btohqsg
I bet you look like that atm,btohqsg
You say that like it's a bad thing,btohqsg
Dobby is an absolute sex bomb,btohqsg
Usually it's to specialise into something you're already working in,btohqsg
You can actually talk to your boss to get the company to sponsor,btohqsg
If you in govt sector  masters degree is good.,btohqsg
Actually the higher the position  the less stressful but the higher the responsibility.Because no longer doing the mundane technical work  but managing a group of people to do it.,btohqsg
