Our buses got sold to Thailand tho and they continued servicing Thai people for like 10 more years,btohqsg
buses are a different story though  there are height weight length etc. limitations but not as restrictive as trains,btohqsg
bus got road can operate liao,btohqsg
and anw lifespan of a train is v v long,btohqsg
not much value aso might as well scrap or reuse in Singapore for some other purpose,btohqsg
some of the trains got scrapped while it was like 20 years old,btohqsg
I mean that is what I thought and is happening,btohqsg
some trains in sg almost 40 yrs old,btohqsg
but being operated in service in another country is unlikely,btohqsg
and go scrap those that just turn 20,btohqsg
yep  like with 3rd rail  they used an actual old train (one of the 6 KHI  095/096  only 3095 and 1095  others scrapped  those 2 later scrapped oso retrofitted with Toshiba PMSM propulsion system fun fact)  SAFTI city  using one or few trains (suspected 345/346 and 003/004 iinw)  spf? using an SIE/C651  211/212 was it?  and train hotel at garden's by the bay  not 100% sure what set tho hv to cfm once it's out (plus if i do its insider info lol),btohqsg
That's the Singapore to Bangkok train,btohqsg
and also 3320 repurposed for ITE WEST  along with an SIE/C651 bogie with some C151/KHI parts,btohqsg
but what hurts the most for me about this is that,btohqsg
they use old trains for safti city,btohqsg
guys i wanna get a monitor,btohqsg
Train route of the singspore-bangkok train,btohqsg

and occasionally connect to my switch,btohqsg
Saf got some old Mrt carraiges,btohqsg
They also got the old money train,btohqsg

any1 else doesnt like cheese cake? tried it for the 1st time at saiz,btohqsg
Starbucks or coffee bean does it better,btohqsg

The turnaround time for St logs is usually 1 month so that is damn long,btohqsg
Got like cat & the fiddle they do amazing cheesecakes go check them out,btohqsg
Bruh your side fucked up lol,btohqsg
actually was eating w a fren n he has had cat and the fiddle twice but he say saiz taste similar,btohqsg
