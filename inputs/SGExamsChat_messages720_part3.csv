rvhs is the middle child compared to dhs,btohqsg
the same reason my younger sib does not want to go there anymore,btohqsg
Ngl i dont like my sch at all,btohqsg
How did you miss the bot above lol,btohqsg
so much awful things happened there,btohqsg
of something like a murder happening at rv again,btohqsg
Hais so many sex bots here,btohqsg
That honestly says a lot abt the sch culture,btohqsg
Oh ok thought you would‚Äôve seen it since it was right above your msg,btohqsg
ya i wld be scared too if i was a student studying in rvhs üíÄ,btohqsg
imagine if acjc had axe cases,btohqsg
If got ppl with untreated mental disorders maybe,btohqsg
If normal ppl worried abt that in a sch in a one off incident then its like pffft,btohqsg
Not like security checks the bags,btohqsg

the reason tmjc stop offering fm with 4H2s is bc they scared ppl do shit,btohqsg

North hill  / crespion is the bombs,btohqsg
Should just tighten the requirements for 4H2 with f math,btohqsg
if it lets the jc keep offering the subject so be it,btohqsg
if your s.o. loves milo it's not a green flag  it's 1000 green flags,btohqsg
U can always drop out of jc and end up in rp,btohqsg
@iestinhe says this but im still single,btohqsg
cos you have to find someone who loves milo too,btohqsg
Maybe time tabling issues since there are fewer very capable students who can and would want to do 4H2 with f math,btohqsg
someone whos life revolves around milo,btohqsg
no coke no pepsi no 100 plus,btohqsg
Like that those f math ppl who want to do 4H2 would just look elsewhere,btohqsg
our class 5 ppl are taking PFME,btohqsg

the thing is  unlike o ºs am  in a ºs  taking fm is not even a compulsory thing,btohqsg
11 years to my 2 room flexi,btohqsg
rp mentioned üòçüòçüòç wtf is being considerate and not littering,btohqsg
