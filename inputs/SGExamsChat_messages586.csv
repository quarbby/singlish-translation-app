It’s like a snowball -Warren Buffet,btohqsg
u can search for ntu mech eng starting pay,btohqsg
MOE will support govtyes teach about compoundingand that's why must put everything in your cpf,btohqsg
im sure its about high 3k low 4k range,btohqsg
maybe finlit comes into good use when i take a loan but i will never invest in stocks or real estate,btohqsg
2.5k is that guy kena low balled,btohqsg
about 15 years ago it was mid 3k,btohqsg
not bad  there's about a 15% gain over 15 years,btohqsg
eh but tbh even if moe did teach  people wont care unless it is tested,btohqsg
mind asking how much was your starting pay back then?,btohqsg
moe would teach it as a maths,btohqsg
i pretty sure compound interest was taught for E/Amaths,btohqsg
mine was based on 14 months  but if recalculated to 13 months  it would be 3.3k,btohqsg
the info we see online is usually calculated using 12 month basis right,btohqsg
how u wanna educate someone when he dont wanna listen,btohqsg
there will be a 13th month AWS bonus usually,btohqsg
Exactly I can believe why someone wouldn’t wanna invest  it’s quite simple,btohqsg
that is why dont let anyone close know u are investing,btohqsg
only let them know when u sold,btohqsg
I'm not at the level but I know of someone who bought into bonds  then borrow at low interest previously and went into higher coupons bonds,btohqsg
but again ah dont all in this,btohqsg
his effective earning on principal is 7%,btohqsg
can go and buy stocks one,btohqsg
Has anyone day-traded and actually made decent profits?,btohqsg
they give u a certain amount every half yearly right,btohqsg
yes I know someone last time who did that and actually averaged near 10k monthly,btohqsg
person did it for 2 yrsthen I never follow liao,btohqsg
How do these people usually do it? Just by “feels” or technical analysis magic,btohqsg
nowadays is sell course to make money,btohqsg
every night she did a lot of homework researching everything,btohqsg
either have info or they have technical analysis,btohqsg
can win can losebut ensure win more than lose,btohqsg
it is like their full time job at that point,btohqsg
it's about tweaking probability to your advantage,btohqsg
I think I shd work for a few weeks then try my hand at trading $500,btohqsg
how much u wanna get out of that $500 first,btohqsg
I have no idea never day traded before,btohqsg
jus saying throwing $500 into stock market is like flicking your hand after washing your hands. using that flick to fight fire,btohqsg
those fun fun managers ok with emotions because not their $$,btohqsg
the world best investor averaged 20% annually from 1950s to 2022and full time in it,btohqsg
how u even lose full 500,btohqsg
@juicecogensask him how much he wins,btohqsg
as in stocks dont come in full numbers,btohqsg
You need a solid strategy to minimise risk   I’m not very proficient with all these technical indicator stuff  so I’m gonna try sentiment analysis on trading forums  eg on Twitter,btohqsg
another 15k for another counter that had dual listing and closed listing on sgx,btohqsg
so nowadays I go for safer sg counters,btohqsg
and if you use discount brokers  there's an added risk of the broker closing,btohqsg
u should search for a place call wall street bets,btohqsg
pain but is small enough part of my portfolio not to affect my lifestyle,btohqsg
that is the place u wanna go to go big or go home,btohqsg
the person can make money and I still lose,btohqsg
I’ve seen guys on there with like a 100k in debt lmaoo,btohqsg
Never said I’m gonna do that,btohqsg
bro this convo is going no where,btohqsg
I was just asking you guys if you knew anyone who did that,btohqsg
and i said yes there a plenty number of them,btohqsg
but they are treating it as a job,btohqsg
Guess it can be quite addictive  it’s essentially gambling,btohqsg
u should try paper trading first,btohqsg
losing and earning imaginary money first,btohqsg
Oh yeah that’s a good suggestion,btohqsg
I should find the news article on this guy who paper traded and won a lotthen proceed to use real money and end up losing his own  his parents money and into large debtsjust because he kenna financial crisis when he started with real money,btohqsg
did a downie here just say,btohqsg
U must know alot of us here are below 21,btohqsg
The sooner you start the better,btohqsg
no  later the head all think of $$ and retirement and not study,btohqsg
pick up enough knowledge  earn enough  you will reach the goals much faster,btohqsg
how many have the right mindset tho,btohqsg
put yourself in their shoes  at the age of 16 will u be thinking of buying your first stock,btohqsg
the thing is if you keep thinking of it  then you limit your future potential,btohqsg
it's not hard to pick up the understanding and applyit's much harder to gather the capital to do so,btohqsg
doesn't matter when your starting pool is low,btohqsg
someone with a higher starting capital will still easily earn more with less effort,btohqsg
the compounding aint much when u start working and getting paid monthly,btohqsg
so you are proposing to pick up knowledge...,btohqsg
how  pray  does one do that?,btohqsg
don't think about investing before you have your first 20k to 30k at the bare minimum,btohqsg
I would put it at 20k,btohqsg
last time one uncle advised me 50k. I heck care start at around 20k lol,btohqsg
this is a good point. settle all your debts  and set aside emergency funds first,btohqsg
this uncle is a blogger i super respect btw,btohqsg
start mid small  because u have enough to play around  yet if you lose  you can easily bounce back,btohqsg
must be enough to be pain if you lose  then you learn emotions,btohqsg
emotionless may unknowingly turn into recklesswhich isn't what you want,btohqsg
everything boils down to the numbers  which is the mathsso master your maths well.It's not so much about the maths techniques  but about the analytical skills you acquire,btohqsg
depends tbh  would say if u have spare money that u dont mind losing  try investing,btohqsg
the amount that u lose  take it as a tuition fee,btohqsg
then will go in with extra care,btohqsg
"I feel like ""don't mind losing"" is more for sales persons to sell those risky funds",btohqsg
every dollar is a soldier we deploy to earn,btohqsg
definitely will have losses. All who invest for long will sure confirm plus guarantee chop encounter losses,btohqsg
the idea is to turn the probabilities around to make wins > losses,btohqsg
I should do SGExams youtube investing channel  investing knowledge for students 🙊,btohqsg
First videodon't invest now  go study first,btohqsg
Exactly  this is why I don’t support trading / technical analysis kinda stuff. If you lose $50 out of $100  you’re left with $50 and you have to make a 200% return just to get back where you started,btohqsg
Looking at it as percentages really helps,btohqsg
technical analysis has its usage. It's about probability,btohqsg
u should watch this mit open lecture about financial basics,btohqsg
I mean it makes logical sense  it’s easier to ensure you have proper risk management than speculate a “good” return on investment,btohqsg
"search up ""1. Introduction  Financial Terms and Concepts"" skip to 45 min for him to give u an example for risk adversion",btohqsg
i kinda agree with you! maybe it's a girl thing  but i've never done technical analysis or complicated math to invest or ever done research on any company  and i never will,btohqsg
my mum showed me how to put my extra money in ETFs  and i've been doing  that  and i maybe spend 1 hour on it a year max,btohqsg
if u can do maths  u can roughly understand basic technical analysis,btohqsg
but why? the money is growing well enough without me looking at it,btohqsg
abit contradicting to what u learn about how only hard work pays off but in investing i feel is if u made the right choice and be early  u get paid for it,btohqsg
sometimes is not your fault  it is just u suay and buy into it at the wrong time,btohqsg
but that's the thing. why make any choice  and why do any timing?,btohqsg
i feel like mine is the stupidest thing to do of all. don't make any choice  just buy the whole market  and put pocket money inside regularly. that's really it. super dumb.,btohqsg
which is good enough rdy what,btohqsg
i feel like girls reading this chat and all the guy talk about super complicated stuff will get turned off from even the basic stuff,btohqsg
yes that's my point. i'm just saying it doesn't have to be so complicated as you guys are making it out to be,btohqsg
thats why u should always do your research first,btohqsg
by research i mean google for it,btohqsg
hmm no offence but do u feel like sometimes it's like healthcare?,btohqsg
as in doctors prefer sick people cos they can sell more meds and treatment,btohqsg
prefers poor people who are clueless,btohqsg
yeah i'm just being perverse sry,btohqsg
i think they all dream of an app that can auto issue MC to ppl and charge money  no clinic visit needed haha,btohqsg
Btw I heard that if you keep taking leave MC to go back to mainland you'll have to serve more days of ns,btohqsg
only thing will delay your ord date is DB,btohqsg
I also saw somewhere if you sign on you get scholarship,btohqsg
Are u referring to the saf scholarship,btohqsg
Also like how to improve in bio,btohqsg
The content part is easy but the answering part I struggle in,btohqsg
Relate FR   I think easier said than done  figure out what u don't understand and work from there,btohqsg
did your cher give any feedback?,btohqsg
I mean there's no easy way out 😭,btohqsg
Nt tho  I did not rlly ask but from doing practice papers I find that sometimes I have that one point that isn't in the answer key and one that Ieft oht,btohqsg
Compared to them in blue chas card lol,btohqsg
So like how to ck my way out of ns,btohqsg
Lol scarly they feel it's normal cause they spend >20 a day,btohqsg
coz if u not in  go in with openmind first,btohqsg
Is ns first or a levels first better,btohqsg
And is there any thing I have to do for deferment for a levels,btohqsg
keane did ms lim wrote u a letter and give you jiangjiangmyeon and banana milk before ???@huehuehue115,btohqsg
found these while cleaning my room,btohqsg

Cause u nvr know what kind of stories he'll end up sharing,btohqsg
mine not dark  just funny and stupid,btohqsg
every lab mod i've had  i've seen someone break smth expensive,btohqsg
someone in y1 broke a HeNe laser,btohqsg
bc genius decided to put milo next to it in a lab that clearly says no food and drinks,btohqsg
I thought breaking test tubes  conical flasks and even burettes are kinda bad alr but damn,btohqsg
y1s1: HeNe lasery1s2: a set of Helmholtz coilsy2s1: Stirling enginey2s2: 3d printery3s1: 3d printer but bigger,btohqsg
and ftr i might TA lab next sem so pray for me,btohqsg
first 3d printer is tbh not that bad like some malfunction with the magnets,btohqsg
bc we used it not for actual printing,btohqsg
you ever see someone accidentally body slam a 3d printer?,btohqsg
Fr sia idk how my classmate break the burette uh when he took it out from that burette stacks  he prob didn't hold firmly and it just topple over like humpy Dumpty,btohqsg
who tf broke the HeNe laser,btohqsg
how did that person use it,btohqsg
even someone as dumb as me can operate that laser just fine,btohqsg
Then human rxn time lol bro was stoned on the spot,btohqsg
And it happened right infront of me,btohqsg
It's the thing that u least expected from happening,btohqsg
oh yea in the y3 lab  we used a HeNe laser also but it's on a top shelf,btohqsg
I heard I'll be able to go visit sutd next yr,btohqsg

they were telling us to be super careful bc the setup is damn annoying to do,btohqsg
i swear i saw someone bump it with their elbow,btohqsg
probs gave some poor experimentalist hell,btohqsg
and this is not like a few weeks lab experiment kind of setup,btohqsg
it's months and months of work,btohqsg
From that point forth  it became non-existent,btohqsg
idk if you look closely at research labs,btohqsg
half of them dk what they're doing,btohqsg
like it's the nature of a phd,btohqsg
everyone just trying to find their way,btohqsg
What they doing r all new stuff right,btohqsg
Oh then what abt those minority who do,btohqsg
that's usually the prof + 1-2 postdocs,btohqsg
like they alr have phds but aren't faculty,btohqsg
Those who broke the lab apparatuses didn't get their name taken down or they did?,btohqsg
i mean they just gotta pay for it or part of it,btohqsg
that ‘s not as pricey as sg,btohqsg
I just ate2 adults 3 kids $84 lehif next year my eldest P1 with the student pass  get 30% off some more,btohqsg

"Ah did they state that u have to confirm with them before a certain ""deadline"" though? I mean ig u can just say I might need more time to consider your job offer because something last min pop up?",btohqsg
"Then u can  perhaps add on   "" I'll be sure to reply u as soon as possible by/within X days""",btohqsg
i see ! no they didn’t and i’m asking them rn ☺️,btohqsg
tbh i just said expressed how grateful and honoured i am and i rlly want to make the right choice,btohqsg
If they didn't  I wouldn't say it's bad to leave them hanging but it wouldn't be good if u did anw LOL if u really wanna be professional,btohqsg

cause I mean if u do ah   this might help in a sense,btohqsg
Let's say the day u got job2 response   then just nice u can give job1 employers Ur definite answer,btohqsg
Is it possible to “accept” your current offer for the time being  until the other company gets back to you on Mon  and then you could just tell them you have a change of plans,btohqsg
I mean that’s assuming you don’t sign any docs in the next 2 days,btohqsg
what if they ask me sign contract alr,btohqsg
2 ibterview alr straight say okie,btohqsg
Tbh take ur time to consider  no need to be pressurized,btohqsg
that’s quite significant right THATS WHYYY,btohqsg
that’s why like i can’t just reject job 1 rn bc it’s def letting go of a good opportunity,btohqsg
gotta get that $ bag 💰,btohqsg
If money isn’t your priority rn  go for job 1,btohqsg
i searched online and emailed my resume!,btohqsg

as long as i got a working phone is aight,btohqsg
meanwhile i need a good pc to play good games,btohqsg
And the newer iPhones are not worth it,btohqsg
u won't get any smarter with ipad 11 inch,btohqsg
Doesn’t justify dropping 2k on it,btohqsg
the bulk of that money goes to camera  the chip and i think the titanium,btohqsg
idek what grade that titanium is but,btohqsg
Yeah the 15 pro max or wtv bs is that much,btohqsg
why need an ipad brah 😹😹,btohqsg
they think using instagram  telegram gonna overclock their chip,btohqsg
I stopped reading about these phones after the 12  they’re all just repeats cuz Apple is running out of ideas,btohqsg
it don matter 3.2k pc >>> 2k ipad + 1k midphone 15,btohqsg
would say if u are dumb getting an ipad wont make u smart overnight,btohqsg
no way u gonna open 4 tabs and wank,btohqsg
iPad only if Med school or some design course or smth  otherwise no need,btohqsg
just use note n pen 😹😹,btohqsg
and don't buy iphone 13 onwards,btohqsg
Sorry la I not engineer 😢,btohqsg
im gonna use my mom's old iphone qq,btohqsg
cuz my 10 is gonna die,btohqsg
iPhones are damn durable  they’re lifespan is like 5+ years if you don’t trash it  that’s why it’s priced so high in the first place lol,btohqsg
I’ve literally people using iPhone 5s and 6s on the mrt bef,btohqsg
i get iphone xr as my first phone at 11,btohqsg
i used pen and paper notebooks for 3 years in uni,btohqsg
mainly switched to tablet for research purposes,btohqsg
I’m talking about the brand itself  and if there are any changes to it  it’s “planned obsolescence”  Apple gets sued for that lmao,btohqsg
Ok then I can’t comment  I’m using a 10,btohqsg
can play games on the ipad,btohqsg
Nothing has failed so far for me,btohqsg
MacBooks are the most value for money,btohqsg
The new M1 and 2 chips are so good,btohqsg
Casual users yeah. There are Definitely people doing like Blender or some training some neural network and shit,btohqsg
My MacBook Air batt lasts 1 week when I’m not using it heavily,btohqsg
yeah but ipad have apple pen,btohqsg
like if i dont feel like typing can use them to take notes,btohqsg
Ok go buy out the entire inventory,btohqsg
eh even for neural networks most people don’t need that much,btohqsg
I have like an M1  can’t train a CNN model where the training dataset is like a few GB,btohqsg
And tensorflow heats it up like crazy,btohqsg
my laptop is i think weaker but i don’t have issues training GANs for hours,btohqsg
i use pytorch not tensorflow tho,btohqsg
iphone 11 is literally fye compared to my x nkw,btohqsg

Oh I didn’t know unis had that,btohqsg
Or you just buy Google Collab premium,btohqsg
nus ntu both have but not sure about others,btohqsg
buy during the student discount for apple,btohqsg
at some point you gonna figure out whether you’re paying for what you need and features you want,btohqsg
or just bc you simp for the brand,btohqsg
I just remembered  the only good thing about buying an iPad is the free AirPods they used to give you,btohqsg
yea like i mean if that’s appealing to you feel free,btohqsg
I think no more free AirPods now lol,btohqsg
