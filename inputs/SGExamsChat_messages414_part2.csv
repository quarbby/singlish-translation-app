Mass is a generalised vector though,btohqsg
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are equivalent but more powerful formalisms,btohqsg
my phys cher told me inside the earth is a giant magnet that human open up the earth and put inside,btohqsg
sekali he lives in your penthouse basement...like the parasite movie...,btohqsg
Can i borrow ur buggati ?,btohqsg
I have just thrown away Lagrangian at this point,btohqsg
classical ill just stick to newtonian thanks,btohqsg
must be harmonious in ur house then,btohqsg
To be fair Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are all Newtons laws in a different form,btohqsg
and makes solving certain types of questions much easier,btohqsg
Hamiltonian is not energy when time derivative is not 0Lagrangian is easier to generalise to field theory,btohqsg
Spinor field and bilinear forms go brrrrr,btohqsg
Also in fairness  I haven’t had to use either in a while,btohqsg
ok why r we entering stage 4 cancer,btohqsg
Also the gamma matrices not being representation independent still hurts my head,btohqsg
the way I got taught classical mechanics wasn’t great tbh,btohqsg
feel like I didn’t get a good view of things,btohqsg
had to really drill things in my own time,btohqsg
Yea my supervisor was telling me how NTUs quantum mechanics undergrad syllabus is severely lacking,btohqsg
cos how many r actually going into quantum,btohqsg
Quantum engineering programme is paid for by Prime Ministers office so uhhhh not sure what's up with your statement,btohqsg
resources to dive into actual quantum research,btohqsg
my stipend is under this lol,btohqsg
Singapore is one of the biggest quantum computing hubs in the world,btohqsg
There’s actually a lot of resources going into quantum tech,btohqsg
And I mean any physics research is gonna make use of quantum mechanics,btohqsg
sg doesnt even have a single nobel laureate,btohqsg
Idk about every field but quantum tech research is pretty well regarded internationally,btohqsg
I mean this is really not a good measure of how good research is in a country,btohqsg
that’s expecting all research to be some insane groundbreaking publication,btohqsg
the budget isnt that high either?,btohqsg
dude usa defence budget alone is 2x sg gdp,btohqsg
i like how you talked abt research n gdp and my project is researching on these 2 topics and data plotting it..,btohqsg
yah cos budget quite significantly affects how much can be done,btohqsg
Yea but it’s spread across so many different areas,btohqsg
like u rly rly cannot compare,btohqsg
The main thing is Singapore is very picky on what they allocate resources to,btohqsg
no i was just dumb and chose to do my data plotting on RnD vs employment.. and my prof said to add 1 more  and my friend gave me GDP..,btohqsg
and you really cannot use this to say sg does not have the resources for research,btohqsg
a quick google search shows sg is about 5bil/year,btohqsg
Esp since my initial point was the undergrad curriculum …,btohqsg
Which has nothing to do with the research,btohqsg
generally  not many people wld actually require indepth knowledge of quantum mech  so a rough idea shld be enuf,btohqsg
this applies to all areas of sg education,btohqsg
unless ur telling me ppl chose to specialise in a quantum mech course? or smt liddat,btohqsg
and the syllabus is still insufficient,btohqsg
it's not about the rough idea. it is actually pretty fundamental stuff that gets left behind at times,btohqsg
nobody needs to know the fundamental stuff tho,btohqsg
uh yea you do for quantum mech,btohqsg
you can't do a lot of specialised courses,btohqsg
