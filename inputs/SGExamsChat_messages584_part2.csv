As if 10 years of Med school wonâ€™t kill your alr ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But also gonna be oversaturated soon in sg,btohqsg
Yeah I came across some Med school book somewhere  that shit is insane  I canâ€™t believe people actually have to read thru even one of those,btohqsg
True but the worklife balance is bad,btohqsg
Nowadays I hear the WLB for SWEs all over also declining  even though itâ€™s not as horrible as lawyers or docs  yet,btohqsg
They did what they had to  which was hyping up the industry to meet the shortage  now the issue is solved,btohqsg
FR ppl in med do be studying Al the day without touching grass  now that's a deadass commitment,btohqsg
Forgot to add onnn  at least at some PT that's an exaggeration LOL,btohqsg
And the mark scheme is abit more lenient,btohqsg
Idk  last I heard physics is 50% A  which is already high enough  and itâ€™s less painful to study through than bio,btohqsg
There's only 3 subjects with 50% which is math ki and art,btohqsg
If u consider the amount of students who take physics compared to bio,btohqsg
I mean I just feel bio is easier to score than physics,btohqsg
More people take physics than bio  and if physics dist rate is 40%  thatâ€™s already a huge number that gets A due to the difference in cohort size. So my guess is the average person would find phys easier,btohqsg
i think physics is harder but this one i have to disagree,btohqsg
bio is so extremely anal whereas if u can calculate ur stuff for physics u get the marks,btohqsg
Hardest chapter in physics imo is forces and the front part on dynamics and all that  if you can get thru it youâ€™re good,btohqsg
My understanding of physics is also that consistency means jackshit,btohqsg
Cuz ik more people who drop grades from physics from prelims to a levels,btohqsg
Whereas bio every chapter you got like a goddamn essay to memorise (at least for o level bio),btohqsg
Cuz suddenly cambridge they pull out all the monkey things,btohqsg
O level bio is easier than o level physics,btohqsg
H2 physics is easier than h2 bio,btohqsg
imagine that times 25-30 for H2 bio,btohqsg
O level physics also quite dry,btohqsg
Forgot the stats from sec sch so I donâ€™t rmbr,btohqsg
Ik for me at leastO level bio I listen to my cher talk is enough alrO level physics need practice,btohqsg
9 subjects I took geog lit :(,btohqsg
Yeah for me at least  find it the hardest rn  maybe itâ€™s cuz I didnâ€™t even study that stuff during o levels or J1 lol,btohqsg
Oh that means I'm dumb LOL HAHA,btohqsg
i hated pure physics so much,btohqsg
I think the ease of h2 physics is just that,btohqsg
i dropped it halfway through sec 3,btohqsg
I never understood my physics concepts until jc,btohqsg
but if u say that in jc,btohqsg
i hope u happy with a U,btohqsg
Correct me if I'm wrong but does lit skills help u ltr on in gp,btohqsg
Is it even possible to get U for a levels,btohqsg
Geog was a nightmare for me cuz back in sec school me and my friends thought needa memorise stuff word for word lmao  so we ended up writing them out like mo Xie,btohqsg
btw who need sec sch lit tuition hmu,btohqsg
Geog in sec sch has more content than geog in jc,btohqsg
hmmm no i dont think so,btohqsg
the skillsets are very diff for lit and gp,btohqsg
omg finally we agree on sth,btohqsg
I never seen anyone get U before,btohqsg
maybe your vocabulary and writing will be helped at most,btohqsg
The last time I did lit was in sec 2 so ya ðŸ’€ lol,btohqsg
Is this where I come in and say complex vocabulary does not guarantee highest band for language,btohqsg
ive heard of people getting U for gp,btohqsg
gp just act like a woke person for essay and u get high marks,btohqsg
