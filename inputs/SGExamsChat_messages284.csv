Here we have a piece from the 2021 English calligraphy collection,btohqsg
OMG BEDOK UR HANDWRITING SO RABAK,btohqsg
it seems like my bad is your good,btohqsg

0/10 you nv say rate what. it's too neat for a student's handwriting so 0 :/,btohqsg
Then beodk one = student handwriting,btohqsg
Doctor handwriting is not writing. Students writing is writing that takes 1 hour to decipher one sentence  but is still legible cuz the kids need marks yo,btohqsg
Doctors handwriting is jus illegible. Full stop :),btohqsg
7/10 readable but not the best,btohqsg
wdym ew  there's a mod there called koushireo,btohqsg
did you compress the pic horizontally,btohqsg
I'm sorry I really cannot tell whether that is sarcastic or not,btohqsg
what??? how can this be sarcastic,btohqsg
one of the bestm ods lol,btohqsg
because it looks squeezed horizontallybut this is coming from a guy that always writes big to compensate for my poor handwriting so yea don't take my opinions seriously,btohqsg
now I can't tell if it is squeezed horizontally or stretched vertically,btohqsg
keeps the place vv civilized and peaceful,btohqsg
consider that my ugly version of my handwriting,btohqsg
hello! wna ask whats the best time taken to complete per qn in diff subjects (i take pure bio/chem  amath  elect geog/ss),btohqsg
I don't feel there's a best time or so even though my teacher recommended 1min per question for mcq,btohqsg
Easier questions you can probably do in seconds  but harder ones maybe have to think more,btohqsg
that's true  js wna test myself n prac on time management,btohqsg
i fail in papers bc of tht : ),btohqsg
Honestly I find checking prit useless unless for vv obvious careless mistakes,btohqsg
First round put in more effort,btohqsg
you're her lawyer why do you even need to ask,btohqsg
also mangy is a cute name,btohqsg
i will penalise by holding back duck's pay,btohqsg
they arent getting octomoody anytime soon if this behaviour continues,btohqsg
youre already so broke dont buy them anything,btohqsg
but thanks for the suggestion i say,btohqsg
before that he spit bars now hes behind bars,btohqsg
prit useless = pretty useless LOL,btohqsg
You all love chem I know,btohqsg
How many dna have you unzipped today?,btohqsg

Yes yes agreed. He keeps it very peaceful and quiet as well!,btohqsg
Often asking people to not talk too much very politely,btohqsg
Like pure bio +his elec and pure geog,btohqsg
Any tips how to memorise all this stuff,btohqsg
Yea of course it's possible  many have done it before you,btohqsg
Do you really need to memorise all the history(elect) content?,btohqsg
R u taking o‚Äôs this year,btohqsg
No. There are the more important ones. But understanding of the context and rough timeline is important!,btohqsg
Like stakeholders and all is important,btohqsg
Some meaty gritty details not neccessarily,btohqsg
This is coming from my experience studying Pure History at O levels,btohqsg
Anyone here got Higher Chinese TYS w y‚Äôll?,btohqsg
I need the qn for 2019 Paper 1 ‰ΩúÊñá..both june and nov,btohqsg
Isokay I no need alr I found it,btohqsg
And is it true history is a subject you don‚Äôt need to study for,btohqsg
Some studying is inevitable for history,btohqsg
But the way you study can be fun:),btohqsg
Need a good mix of Understanding of content + practicing papers.,btohqsg
She ‚Äòs not wrong.. sometimes studying does seem fun.,btohqsg
I type notes on MS Words and refer from there.,btohqsg
Yeah I agree esp after going through O levels and A levels  I enjoy studying Humanities.,btohqsg
idk it differs from ppl to ppl  but for me my way of memorisation is to write things out  so i basically went through both geog textbooks and summarised everything lmao,btohqsg
I studied pure History and H2 history,btohqsg
bio made way more sense to me so idk it was just remembering keywords and stringing them together,btohqsg
About Raffles etc. SEA history is more relatable.,btohqsg
Decolonization and colonisation of states  colonialism and imperialism is intriguing!,btohqsg
It is also fascinating to know that Hitler ‚Äòs not from Germany and Napoleon ‚Äòs not from France either.,btohqsg
yeboi i only studied ww2 and it didn't come out,btohqsg
I read ab it tho I'm not there yet,btohqsg
yea i didn't study for ss either,btohqsg
i sucked at writing the essays anyway,btohqsg
Is it cuz full of talking? I only know during the Cold War. They shot down two pax aircraft.,btohqsg
I go into ss exam without knowing anything,btohqsg
coz I like the essay part,btohqsg
Haha what a mood. I have studied the cold war from sec school to JC ü§£,btohqsg
just memorise and write can liao,btohqsg
Ss study the whole textbook for 8 marks,btohqsg
To do well in History  u need to be good at both essay writing and SBQ,btohqsg
SBQ is often a differentiator btw a A/B student and the rest,btohqsg
I'm majoring in History now. So I can say this is really important!,btohqsg
WVEN THO I CRY OVER IT,btohqsg
Hahaha. I like both SS and History equally,btohqsg
I think the only reason I enjoy ss is like my Cher makes it entertaining,btohqsg
Yeah Teachers do make a big difference to one's interest in the subject,btohqsg
To make boring subjects interesting is a skill.,btohqsg
My lecturer make our module interesting too.. Although he curse at it sometimes.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just gon pray that he ain‚Äôt in this group I think I‚Äôll die,btohqsg
Not all of them will use Tele. Do they?,btohqsg
Haha my history modules are more interesting as my profs make some jokes along the way.,btohqsg
My prof do. There is even a Telegram group for my module.,btohqsg
Mine have both Tele and WhatsApp. But Tele is quite dead.,btohqsg
Hahaha mine is also pretty dead except when it is nearer to assignment deadlines,btohqsg
Mine only used like initially. Now is like forgotten.,btohqsg
Like those looking for access to books and sources for essay writing,btohqsg
The rest of the days is pretty dead,btohqsg
Although my lecturer like to create WhatsApp stickers,btohqsg
Me and 2 of other my other friends be the 'lawyers' in our SS class,btohqsg
we argue for everything w the SS chers,btohqsg
Mine do talk to us casually. Very chill.,btohqsg
what de my one is I argue for the Cher,btohqsg
I guess it is dependant on the lecturer or prof :),btohqsg
Yah. Depends on the kind of character.,btohqsg

i have no friends so üíÄ,btohqsg
what‚Äôs it like being 18 meow,btohqsg
i have 2 meows at home hehehe,btohqsg
anyone from rp here know how to calculate grades,btohqsg
YepIt depends on whether your module is 100% daily grades  or your module is an exam module  or your module has both daily grades and graded assignment,btohqsg
If your module is an exam module such that there's only ESE GPA = 60% [grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended] + 40% (exam grade that you get),btohqsg
If your module has only daily grades (daily grades = 100% of your module grade) GPA = grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended,btohqsg
If your module has graded assignmentGPA = 60% (grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended) + 40% (grade that you get for graded assignment),btohqsg
If your module is an exam module where there's both MSA and ESE GPA = 40% [grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended] + 60% [(40% * grade you received for MSA) + (60% * grade you received for ESE)],btohqsg
For both graded assignment and exam A - 4B+ - 3.5B - 3And so onFor daily gradesOnly A  B  C... (where there's no + behind  so only 4  3  2 etc ),btohqsg
AwwSeems like you like meows a lot  right?üòç,btohqsg
I heard Monitor lizards are quite intelligent to be adopted as pets.,btohqsg
So if it‚Äôs 2 Bs 6 Cs 4 Ds 60% + 40% ESEif i fuck up my ESE can i still get a D-,btohqsg
i really hope so ah i really dw fail lol shag,btohqsg
I knowI'm also quite worrying about my grade,btohqsg
How I wish I could be able to study with this format before I went for internshipNow because of COVID-19  daily grade can't be 40% anymore  which is quite frustratedüò≠Idk if I can be able to get at least B for the module that I had to take exam :(,btohqsg
any tech geek here can help,btohqsg
Whr do girls get their thrift clothes ah,btohqsg
My friend ask me meet them at some thrift shop in sg and I'm like idk whr,btohqsg
