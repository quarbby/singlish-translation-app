CGS-CIMB technical buy call on Medtecs released this morningSince hitting a record high at 1.98 in August  price has been stuck in a severe correction  falling as much as -40%. Despite breaking below the 20 day moving average on 3 September  the immediate bullish rejection off the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on 4 September suggests the long-term uptrend remains intact. Moreover  price also formed a bullish price action  Piercing Pattern at the same time showed some early sign of strength.More importantly  the recent retest of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and 1.19 support area on 11 September was met with a similar bullish reaction. As a result  price formed another bullish price action  Hammer rejection off the support area signals a high likelihood of a rebound higher.Hence  expect price to bounce higher to test the 1.60 resistance area. The current low at 1.17 could be the next Higher Low (HL) point for the uptrend.,btohqsg

For Nov 2020  Top Glove‚Äôs nitrile glove ASP would be 4.1x that of Feb 2020‚Äôs level and we understand that there is still another 30-50% upside. Additionally  the ASP hike for latex powder free gloves has reaccelerated for Nov 2020 and there is still room to raise the ASP further. We raise FY20/21/22E EPS by 6%/63%/224% on higher ASPs  but retain our TP at MYR9.53 (ex-bonus) on a lower CY21E P/E target of 9x  about -1SD of 5Y mean (vs. 16x)  on consideration for earnings to taper post CY21E. BUY.,btohqsg
