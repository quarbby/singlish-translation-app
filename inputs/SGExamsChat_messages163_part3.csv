It's fine  people have their ups and downs in life. Anyways  we all know you are very intelligent,btohqsg
like psle if u get in,btohqsg
1. Contrary to popular belief  Art is not just about the doing of Art but also understanding of Art (paper 3)2. Even if we’re talking about the making of Art  there are actually talented artists who will struggle to get A in the O level subject Art is because the kind of Art Cambridge is expecting in their rubrics is narrow. So  talent =/= score  you need to be their rubric and not all talented ppl can fit their rubric and some ppl can fit rubric with no talent haha.,btohqsg
A for math A for chi A for sci,btohqsg
Don't worry  we won't judge you,btohqsg

Then i got marked as skipped sch,btohqsg
Its a hyphen all the way,btohqsg
No matter you mean it literally or sarcastically I agree  haha PW is like just that conflicting.,btohqsg
Literally. Really. I enjoyed PW. Because I was the leader and had control over almost everytjing. Did everything I wanted,btohqsg
Yeah so likelt 1/4 ppl in ur grp enjoyed it,btohqsg
I had 5 people in my group,btohqsg
Which is rougjly thr statistic for most grps,btohqsg
Ok then this subj has failed to achieve its purpose on you,btohqsg
That's your opinion  but I think it was my second favourite subject in JC  after economics,btohqsg
No  I look back at my PW work from time to time. I often stayed up until 4 am ish . Very proud of what I did,btohqsg
How is it possible to get everything done your way in a project unless you do everything yourself,btohqsg
A lot of my group members cannot write very well  so I just did it,btohqsg
Only OP then it was more equally split,btohqsg
Here I was in an officially 5 person group but feels like only 3.5 ppl working  complaining about the burden and you found tanking amazing. Wow  amazing.,btohqsg
The true tanking role begins in uni,btohqsg
By any chance did you write their script for them,btohqsg
Idea was from a another person's PI. I protested as I wanted to do BRT (bus rapid transit) using my PI.Scripts for OP was written by them  edited by meIdeas  apart from the initial idea and a few other things  it was mine.,btohqsg
I guess I like to work alone  so others not interfering let me do what I wanted. Worked out for everyone I guess,btohqsg
Oooo you’re from a batch with PI?,btohqsg
From what I recalled  we just summarised what was said in the WR and I edited a lot.,btohqsg
You mean... there's no PI now?,btohqsg
I was the last batch with PI  they scrapped it,btohqsg
My time was PI  then form group  then group project proposal  then WR  then OP  then I and R,btohqsg
isn't PI and EOM super impt?,btohqsg
I thought they'd scrap I&R if any,btohqsg
By my calculations  you are born in 2000,btohqsg
From what I gather they still make them do but it’s no longer graded and we all know how students treat non-graded work,btohqsg
Yeah  you get to choose your ideas from one of the members for the WR,btohqsg
I see no value in I&R honestly,btohqsg
but I&R is basically for u to put things that u forgot to put in,btohqsg
It’s basically like a piece on limitations,btohqsg
I did up a mock Fairprice sign that read for your information or something. Found all the correct fonts. Took the photograph at NTUC Rochor Centre,btohqsg
