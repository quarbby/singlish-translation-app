They always post about it  then I be like I don’t see them at my house,btohqsg
Real…but opposition came to my house before,btohqsg
They only come when they need their seat,btohqsg
Tbh I dun even know where and when are the mps…anyway I hv no time to care about such things,btohqsg
If it's a backbencher it doesn't rlly matter too they just gonna get carried by the anchor.. they just show up to sign for the MPS sessions and that's it,btohqsg
My grc has 3 cabinet ministers,btohqsg
They are that worried to give my grc 3,btohqsg
My has that and that's about it,btohqsg
They scared of Nicole Seah and then moved him from Tampines,btohqsg
Wp said it was like a few minutes before the closing deadline of nomination  they hopped him over,btohqsg
About that... no more Nicole liao but honestly don't think it makes a difference,btohqsg
Actually wp would hv won if Heng swee Kiat did not move to East Coast tbh,btohqsg
He back then was the heir apparent,btohqsg
Nicole Seah was popular but she screwd up…in politics  just 1 mistake to screw you,btohqsg
Yeah it was damn close even with HSK,btohqsg
Another shock close was West Coast,btohqsg
That one for next election is legit gonna be gg,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure pap will find its way,btohqsg
They moved ng Chee Meng out of Sengkang,btohqsg
If they do means they conceded Sengkang,btohqsg
Also need to find another anchor for Marine Parade,btohqsg
Their new Sengkang grc for ge2024 dun seem to have anchor leh,btohqsg
So I think they probably choose to concede Sengkang (just like Aljunied),btohqsg
Ya probably means they cut their loses and consolidate,btohqsg
Coz they dun want to lose their ministers,btohqsg
Ok not really cabinet  2 cabinet + 1 speaker,btohqsg
The new speaker is in Marine Parade lol,btohqsg
See Leng and Edwin Tong alone is also cmi,btohqsg
Anyway they already revealed the full Marine Parade team,btohqsg
Cannot shift so they probably gonna take the risk,btohqsg
There are 2 ministers and the speaker of parliament,btohqsg
But they are not particularly strong anchors,btohqsg
All are the current gen one,btohqsg
What if they go for Aljunied,btohqsg
What next they gonna go for Hougang?,btohqsg
Tbh I doubt so…unless something happened to Pritam,btohqsg
But wp need find new good mps..can’t rely on the old ones,btohqsg
one spot not so important to them,btohqsg
Now only mainly hv he ting ru  Jamus lim  denis,btohqsg
Maybe can move He Ting Ru to East Coast,btohqsg
The wp at Hougang is strong so defo not,btohqsg
Sengkang is 3 vs 4 already ?,btohqsg
And + wp won Hougang by a higher proportion than Aljunied,btohqsg
and its one spot in parliament not so important to them,btohqsg
Neh they already lost 1 mp in Sengkang,btohqsg
And he ting ru herself ain’t strong enough to tank,btohqsg
And also I dunno if husband and wife in same grc will be weird,btohqsg
Cuz Pritiam and Sylvia gonna sit their ass in Aljunied,btohqsg
Their Aljunied grc is probably gonna remained strongly fielded,btohqsg
Coz wp wun want to risk losing that,btohqsg
