Hi guys does anyone know for ocbc 360 salary credit can we use our own interbank transfer as salary?,btohqsg
Hi experts  I'm new to the credit card game and to the working world  is it advisable to sign up credit cards just to get sign up rewards and not use the card ever again and cancel it before they charge annual fees. I've read that it affects credit scores and etc and it is not worth if the sign up rewards isn't super massive. Thoughts and advice for this please thank you.,btohqsg
You could sign up from the same bank  eg. UOB Privi for SUB first before PPV  Ladys  VS. Hold all until annual fee cannot be waived. Keep a few months between applying cards from different banks.,btohqsg
Because it was supposed to charge u usd10 fee I guess.,btohqsg
My personal opinion is signing up for cc only you want to use it and can make use of the features/rewards,btohqsg
Hi for PPV Apple Pay is it considered contactless?,btohqsg

hi  if my partner and i now have EGA accounts  to make full use of the bonus interest promos  are there any specific steps i should take to qualify as fresh funds? should i transfer last day or first day of month? do i need to route it through another bank first?,btohqsg
Human A to outside bankOutside bank to human BBeware enhanced checks and blocks these days with big transfer amounts especially if different name accounts.Uncharted territory from 2025.,btohqsg
understood ü´° meanwhile  for cash <100k  is EGA the best high-yield place to park it?,btohqsg
Consistent experience for another human.Called in for Citibank card fee waiver on weekend.$12k usage on Citi smrt$0 usage in Citi m1Both cards waived using phone banking without needing to speak to any loans officer.My humans are all going to do fee waiver on weekends from now on.,btohqsg
my understanding is there are quite some conditions to fulfil correct? last time i checked the interest was higher for the first 2 months of new account but falls off after. currently EGA bonus interest + everyday+ gets me close to 4%. is OCBC360 significantly better?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 can get 4.65% pa. Need save + spend + real salary credit.,btohqsg
Better or not is subjective and depends on individuals.,btohqsg
