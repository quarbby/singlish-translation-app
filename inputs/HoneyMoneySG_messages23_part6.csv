Thanks Jazz  will try to check immediately next time after purchase is made.,btohqsg
Butâ€¦ if possible  just subscribe icloud via telco,btohqsg
In the points summary  there should be an entry on the transaction's posted date. (Probably around 12 Dec)See if it is just 1 point credited  or 1 point + 9 additional points. If the latter  means it qualifies for 10x points.,btohqsg
Don't think u can just sign up icloud via Telco unless u buy a iphone from them,btohqsg
oh i didnt know that.... my bad,btohqsg
Once buy a new iphone drom telco the most is a f 1yr sub Depends on promotion then u got to settle own self mostly is free few months,btohqsg
hi  is there a way to open a Philippines (PHP) bank account to receive money?,btohqsg
Anybody know if GRABLATERâ€™s MCC is the same as grab? This is for the purposes of UOB ONE CC usage,btohqsg
You have to stay in philippines for at least 180 days before you can open a bank account,btohqsg
It's very subjective. Basically you have to decide how much a mile is worth to you,btohqsg
On a basis of airline redemption?,btohqsg
I considering between a 1.6/1.7% Cashback or 1.4miles per $,btohqsg
hi all  can i seek advice on this. For those using UOB One CC. Can i check if e.g in a quarter  1st 2 months i spent >2k  but the 3rd month i only spent 1k  the quarterly cashback given will be based on 1k tier spending? or do i get nth at all as it wasn't consistent. 2K  2K  1K,btohqsg
Lowest tier if Iâ€™m not wrong,btohqsg

HSBC revolution credit cardStill don't have sign-up promo hor? ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
I think this is nerf hahaha. we have to spend over 12000 dollars to earn 328 cashback,btohqsg
i just called them to check on this. They will give based on the lowest tier month. But they say can appeal/,btohqsg
hahaha waiting for a real sign-up gift to apply for his card,btohqsg
Exactly.. need to spend 12k.. ðŸ˜Ÿ,btohqsg
Good things worth to waitâ€¦ ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡,btohqsg
Hi. Does buying air ticket and booking hotel via UOB one or ocbc 365 cc eligible for cashback ?,btohqsg
Hmm so if they will give the $1000 or $2000 tier?,btohqsg
Other than grab  is there any other cards?,btohqsg
Oh nooo  then need to apply for other cards liao,btohqsg
Amex truecashback is it a good card?,btohqsg
Does insurance company consider Financial Institutions? if it does then maybank not eligible,btohqsg
Even if u apply this card  you canâ€™t directly pay the insurers since most donâ€™t accept Amex direct payments. Youâ€™ll need your grabpay card to circumvent thatFor Amex TCB  you have to top up grabpay wallet (for 1.5% cashback) then use the grabpay Mastercard to process payment (via e-AXS maybe)Even though you pay direct via master or visa credit cards and not grabpay   those cards explicitly exclude payments to insurance companies from cashback in their TnC,btohqsg
So paying insurance premium is for Maybank visa platinum,btohqsg
Lol okay I think misunderstandingBy lowest tier I mean $1k cos her lowest spending is $1k,btohqsg
Actually if we pay in full yearly  the insurance premium is 2% cheaper  is this true,btohqsg
Can I check if purchase of NTUC voucher qualify for the min $500 spend?,btohqsg
when u apply online itâ€™s single acc.how to withdraw money- they will send u a physical card within 7 working days & once u activate ur card u can go to an ocbc atm  put in ur card  enter ur pin & withdraw ur money..Not sure abt the taxes sorry,btohqsg
yes annual payment usually cheaper cos u pay at start of year,btohqsg
U need to first go singtel transfer to your name,btohqsg
Use amex true cashback>grabpay master card>axs(insurance),btohqsg
then maybe this is better than using visa platinum  unless you really want to split into 12 months,btohqsg
Generally yearly premium is cheaper then monthly premium of u add up,btohqsg
Why cant we pay in full using credit card?,btohqsg
How to bypass grab wallet top up limit of 5k,btohqsg
But you lose opportunity cost as well. So overall just about the same.,btohqsg
Have anyone found out the best way to top up shopee,btohqsg
A noob question. Am I right to say CRMC with Amaze will convert most transactions to online transactions so to earn the 4mpd  except for travel related MCC?,btohqsg
I do quite a fair bit of contactless payment,btohqsg
Just wondering CRMC or HSBC Revo is better for me (paired with amaze),btohqsg
Yes correct. I would say CRMC for your contactless payments and HSBC revo for travel spending,btohqsg
btw hsbc revo cannot pair with Amaze,btohqsg
But payment upfront lose out in interest. Time value of money.,btohqsg
Cuz its visa! Sorry I miss that,btohqsg
Hi I like to test my hypothesis. As some one who works overseas  I do not gain any tax relief topping up my CPF.  From my standpoint  I feel that I am better off directly investing into equities  and not lock my money into CPF for 2.5 - 4% interest.  Is there something I may be missing in the CPF route to FI?,btohqsg
