If you need independent verification of your own research,btohqsg
If it’s their research ofc they will read right bahaha,btohqsg
But honestly if your own supervisor is not reading  then something is wrong already,btohqsg
Anyway IDK what level this is  because undergrad is not grad  grad is not post doc  and post doc fellow is not independent PI,btohqsg
i’d ask u for permission ur highness,btohqsg
U research  most people won't care,btohqsg
I think the 'hard'-sciences  undergrad research most won't care,btohqsg
isnt that as all the a’s results,btohqsg
PW is always given separate from the other subjects,btohqsg
wow theres soft and hard science?,btohqsg
Hard Sci got research at Undergrad one ah,btohqsg
Soft science is arts and social sciences,btohqsg
Maybe experimental verification  if done well enough by itself.,btohqsg
then what subject is not science at all,btohqsg
I shall hear no more of this Scipremacist Language,btohqsg
I hope NS gobbles you up whole after quarantine is over,btohqsg

why do you need to be a phD,btohqsg
The most over qualified security guard,btohqsg
But lol. Masters to be security guard,btohqsg
Next time janitor also need masters,btohqsg
Then a lot of ppl will be out of jobs le,btohqsg
But they specifically mentioned 硕士so masters Lo,btohqsg
oh so it's a general term,btohqsg
Can’t even have a graduation ceremony,btohqsg

I sarpork this so no accidental manufacturing of Chlorine Gas,btohqsg
If you enter SPF with a degree  you can become an inspectror,btohqsg
INSP is a rank  not a position,btohqsg
So u are just qualified not overqualified,btohqsg
Yeah  but it still requires you to be promoted to there,btohqsg
To join SPF as Investigation Officer you can't be 'just a degree holder',btohqsg
To be an inspector  you should have a degree(it's the prerequisite for Direct Entry Inspector),btohqsg
They work somewhere first got something to flex then go apply ma,btohqsg
In western countries plus sg they don’t really need an advanced degree to do many of the lucrative jobs,btohqsg
Thing is people have a thing against OQ ppl,btohqsg
If u OQ and u can’t get job else where where you aren’t OQ,btohqsg
I run a supermarket and some harvard grad come recruit for cashier,btohqsg

Either he needs to zao soon  or he has something to hide that his previous interviewed companies won't want him,btohqsg
Many HR turn down ppl just based on grade,btohqsg
Some even cos of one grammar error,btohqsg
Why I need some Harvard grad come intimidate the rest of my staff,btohqsg
but if ur working for major mnc,btohqsg
Cashier is unskilled job in that anyone can do without special training. Not that I meant it in a derogatory way,btohqsg
I need think about my team dynamics,btohqsg
If the rest of my staff don't have Harvard degree,btohqsg
Then the Harvard grad come in,btohqsg
