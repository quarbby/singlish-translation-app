idk isnâ€™t ucc for like health issues,btohqsg
Iâ€™m saying all these with 0Hours of sleep,btohqsg
Don't tell me this is it,btohqsg
Great placement tho put it near all the highest intensity and high likelihood of injury places,btohqsg
Omg my japan depression is that bad that im actually tryna find a job in japanese companyðŸ’€,btohqsg
Coz those are like not pharma related or not entry level,btohqsg
Is Japan even known for Pharm? I cannot think of any Pharm Companies in Japan ngl,btohqsg
In sg i think there is only hisamitsu and takeda,btohqsg
Ok but my parents will probably be like ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ if i decide to join sth else coz my degree and suffering wasted,btohqsg
I dun think ANA has customer service in singapore coz their english customer service is in US and philipines,btohqsg
Those are like blended with traditional medicine too ngl,btohqsg
No such thing as a wasted degree imo,btohqsg
It's just how you choose to use your degree.. I mean like if u branch into business it still won't be wasted as the knowledge u learnt still would be useful in those jobs.,btohqsg
True if it is well payed,btohqsg
Yeah basically how useful u wan your degree to be depends on you,btohqsg
But usually if u want to branch out fr ur degree speciality  u need some experience firstâ€¦a fresh degree wun land u those jobs,btohqsg
I even on alert for japanese companies job lol,btohqsg
Internship in their industry u wanna branch out to,btohqsg
Or take a hit with a slightly more entry level position,btohqsg
Then Pivot based on job experience,btohqsg
Tbh entry level position hard to find,btohqsg
Yeah ill admit that too as ppl don't wanna pay dip level for degree level as u will be overqualified,btohqsg
So i also dunno how to find,btohqsg
I am not qualified to give advice on such matters ngl. Most of this chat still in infancy too so Full Time Job Seeking is not in their priorities rn as well,btohqsg
Why would you want to find a job in Japan? Salaries are lower than in Singapore  which is exacerbated by the recent devaluation of the yen. Taxes are higher  too. Work culture is even more toxic than in Singapore.,btohqsg
I mean japan companies in singapore,btohqsg
Oh yea i heard about japanese being overworked,btohqsg
But it is hard to find entry level,btohqsg
You have to send tons of resumes out,btohqsg
I know people who applied to 150 roles and got only 5 interviews,btohqsg
And he is probably lucky to even have 5 interviews,btohqsg
All the jobs i come across requires a few yrs of experience,btohqsg
150 is legit on the lower side of the scale. some people apply to much more,btohqsg
In pharma i think the most entry level role is sales but i dun think i fit that roleðŸ’€,btohqsg
You really have to sit down for a fortnight or so and dedicate yourself 100% to getting a job,btohqsg
Please don't restrict yourself to pharma. Look at management trainee positions too  for example,btohqsg
"Your degree isn't ""wasted""  university is not a vocational institution where you are prepared for a single one-track career path. University is meant to broaden your mind.",btohqsg
It is more of i think for entry level  maybe it will be easier to use ur degree coz some of those other roles may need some degree qualification,btohqsg
That may not be true. Many roles actually don't care what your actual degree is in.,btohqsg
True coz im p sure ppl will be bored if they do the same shit for 30y,btohqsg
Ah ic maybe i will just need to scroll linkedin and find any suitable jobs,btohqsg
Yes. Precisely. You can consider roles in consulting  management  even tech.,btohqsg
But my parents hv been telling me not to give up so easily on securing a licensing trg placement,btohqsg
nah  pharma as a career is overrated  most people drop out of it anyway,btohqsg
Chase the money  not a piece of paper that doesn't necessarily lead to money.,btohqsg
Im open to that but my parents wun be supportive in me branching away fr pharma,btohqsg
Your life is your own. When they are gone  you have to fend for yourself,btohqsg
"In the end  they will still be proud of you despite you not going along with their ""preferred"" career path for you",btohqsg
Sometimes people have tunnel vision when they get a degree in a certain specialty. They think they must get a job in those lines. Don't fall for it.,btohqsg
It is more of they dun want me to â€˜wasteâ€™ my degree aft seeing how i suffered in uni to even graduate,btohqsg
