How tf do you check inventory for C Z U J class  on SQ for example,btohqsg
Google Flights is not granular enough  my friend,btohqsg
No I just watch every Wendover video.,btohqsg
Well  they do make good videos.,btohqsg
But yeah  it is simply impossible to find certain fare combinations on Google Flights,btohqsg
You *must* manually construct it and get a travel agent to go along with it,btohqsg
As I said. Depends on how you query the GDS system to string an itinerary,btohqsg
Correct. But not on Google Flights  dammit,btohqsg
Google Flights is really basic and hides away a lot of stuff,btohqsg
Even with such tools it's useless as the data is not shown in the GDS especially for booking.,btohqsg
As someone who has flown 2 round trips to JFK on SQ biz and ended up with less than 5k PPS value,btohqsg
Try doing that in a snow storm with delayed or cancelled flights.,btohqsg
Now  that's just trolling. irrops can occur no matter how you book your ticket,btohqsg
U can't book southwest flights on the GDS,btohqsg
I'm not gonna reply to that  southwest is a budget airline,btohqsg
Unless got vehicle crash then I come in,btohqsg

#stpotd: For young people  is it worth sacrificing sleep for study? Constant late-night cramming can affect memory and cause cognitive impairment  says a doctor.https://str.sg/bBU6What is your study habit?,btohqsg
late night studying doesn't work.I have seen too many examples.You might be the odd one out but why risk it?,btohqsg
Most do it out of desperation,btohqsg
It ain't the late night studying its the fuel of dying on your exams if u don't,btohqsg
it's about consistency. Not late night studying.No one gets gold in 2.4km by cramming their running training.Why would anyone expect something different to studying?,btohqsg
The hardest to do is maintaining the discipline and motivation to achieving consistency.,btohqsg
Legit made revising easier for me,btohqsg
Note to self: dont drink beer with mala,btohqsg
doesn't just apply for studyingIt's something that extends to everything in life outside school.Applies super heavily to planning your financial,btohqsg
I would say conducive air conditioned environment + good lighting + a detail tutorial explanation session only will work out ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Holy fuck the biggest flying bug idfk what that was scared the shit out of me,btohqsg
I was just on my bed  ac on  windows everything closed,btohqsg
My bed faces the window and the suddenly one fat ass mf zooms out of the curtains and straight towards me,btohqsg
Ducked that shit like i was in professional dodgeball,btohqsg
Worse still  when i try to turn on the lights  somehow this blind sotong bumps into my chest and my soul leaves my body as i fooking lunge away straight into my wardrobe,btohqsg
iâ€™m an odd one out i think but i would advise anyone against it where possible,btohqsg
Hoi si yan shld i get the jarvfjallet,btohqsg
What's the edgiest MediaCorp drama idea you can think of?,btohqsg
"they alr did it  it was called ""The pot""",btohqsg
basically a giant pot of water that span a whole corridor was places between 4 families...the drama literally revolved around that pot of water,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s a decent chair but you need to know what youâ€™re looking for in one,btohqsg
Ehh  doesn't sound too edgy.Here's my idea: Singaporean remake of 24 (it's a US drama series from the 2000s following Jack Bauer  a Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agent. Each season unfolds over 24 hours  1 episode covering 1 hour  depicting Jack's relentless pursuit of dangerous threats against the United States. As he races against the clock  Jack confronts personal betrayals  deadly conspiracies  and difficult moral choices. And he resorts to torture A LOT.)Singaporean version:Title: 24 HoursSynopsis: David Lim is a brilliant and hardened CTU agent under the ISD. When he receives intel of a potential terrorist attack in Yishun during an election rally within the next 24 hours  he has to stop it  but that's not going to be as simple as it looks. Meanwhile  a plane crashes near Singaporean airspace. Thus begins the longest 24 hours of his life...,btohqsg
Ye but not for very long,btohqsg
I like leaning back but the chair doesnt allow enuff for me,btohqsg
Also just learnt some f1 lore  goddam max stole daniils soul,btohqsg
dang you should have gone to harvard,btohqsg
Sry for a rant again but i think at this rate i cant share my struggles w my parents,btohqsg
Every time how they react / talk to me make me feel worst,btohqsg
I hv been breaking down more and more in the past few months,btohqsg
They complain I listen to friends more but do not reflect on themselves  the cause of it,btohqsg
They only know how to say what i need to do to solve the problem but dun realise it is easier said than done,btohqsg
When i say i really need help  like possibly therapy  they brush it aside and say it is expensive,btohqsg
