I thought this is not a valid excuse to defer  you need to be enrolled in an educational institution,btohqsg
Just register u need the deferment,btohqsg
but they cannot give letter cuz I part time oni,btohqsg
I js waiting for their reply since idt they wan give letter,btohqsg
Yes like take the course at ITE,btohqsg
Then give up on this O level?,btohqsg
I stg yt shoving more and more ads in my face,btohqsg
No it's private candidate u are allowed to do both concurrently,btohqsg
Can I msg you regarding more about it,btohqsg
Even better they have a 5 second clip telling you they are about to play an ad,btohqsg
does it work if say he retake Os this year as priv and then register in an educational institution next year then get the deferment?,btohqsg
or after ns registration  cannot defer liao,btohqsg
not sure if it is possible to request for deferment if private candidate but it will be auto if u enrol in an educational institution,btohqsg
so can he actually like register the NS thing now  and then a year later (hopefully) he gets into poly / jc then from there auto defer liao,btohqsg
then what u mean by can req for deferment up to 3y,btohqsg
coz fr my bro's letter  the ns registration only 1m window,btohqsg
But anyway my problem isIm kinda considering dropping to h1 hist because my sea is dogwaterBut my friends say i should wait until after promos to seeSo i wanna askPpl who dropped from 4h2 to 3h2 1h1 1. When did you drop and whats the latest time to drop a subject2. Why did you drop,btohqsg
oh that is what u mean,btohqsg
then how do private candidate request for deferment,btohqsg
i know if u retain in sch / switch fr jc to poly  it is auto deferment,btohqsg
i take 3h2 1h1 all the way but i can tell u my take on this,btohqsg
how many tests have u gone through and are they full assessments or wa sort of thing,btohqsg
"""This is to certify that musician is still a student of tmjc in the year 2024.....""",btohqsg
i believe if u are still in an institution  they will know,btohqsg
But u need apply deferment ONLINE,btohqsg
if exceed 3 years need sch letter,btohqsg
Takes a while for them to update in their system,btohqsg
The school will send but it will take 3 months for it to reflect.,btohqsg
Being in an educational institution approved by CMPB full time.,btohqsg
so in a sense does it work if say u register for NS registration  then next year enrol in somewhere  then the school update it to mindef,btohqsg
No because you need to attend the medical appointment and other PES evaluations,btohqsg
coz it is also the same situation where say a j1 register for ns in june - july  then after promos then retain??,btohqsg
U can in theory push em back about 6 months but I won't risk it,btohqsg
But in that case u would still be in a CMPB approved educational institution while that happen,btohqsg
Ik I had to do medical check up again,btohqsg
Cause ur pes grade valid for 2 years,btohqsg
No it doesn't u waiting for your Olevel results while DPPing rite,btohqsg
That one is called an Immersion,btohqsg
nah I was waiting for pfp,btohqsg
No like u dpp in while waiting for olevel result/pfp result,btohqsg
somehow one of the express people in my old Sch went to ite with a 14 L1R4,btohqsg
I know of a few too,btohqsg
Usually cuz their L1R4 cmi to the course they want,btohqsg
o level result where got pfp ?,btohqsg
my ite class got like 30 people went to pfp after the “immersion”,btohqsg
Most Nlevel candidates if they smart enough they take a few olevel subjects,btohqsg
yes need 70 marks and above in Sec 3,btohqsg
I think I can qualify as Subject Matter expert for all Poly and ITE dropout and transfer matters liao kns,btohqsg
Ya got damn a lot did that lol,btohqsg
There was someone with 10 that went ite,btohqsg
