No need worry about dead battery,btohqsg
Sometimes it has enough for the car to start,btohqsg
But not enough for other functions to work  like infotainment  lights  keyless start  etc.,btohqsg
In this case you can pull out the start button and turn the key,btohqsg
But if your battery is so dead that the engine cannot start because not enough power to starter and ignition systems,btohqsg
I thought the info system will take lesser power,btohqsg
Cars will always shut down non essential systems when battery drains,btohqsg
I encountered many time I can on my info but when crank cannot start,btohqsg
Was it battery related or other issues?,btohqsg
Most modern cars will do this,btohqsg
Had to jump start from other cars or call tow truck to come replace,btohqsg

Rather get cooper S or a JCW,btohqsg
Suspension stiff until no passenger wants to sit with you,btohqsg
very funny actually  thought its limited production  there are still many unsold,btohqsg
The PIs brought in a lot,btohqsg
And they're all sitting in showrooms,btohqsg
They're selling well in countries where they can be used on b-roads and tracked,btohqsg
I think admin loves the 86 a lot,btohqsg
I know got one in SG is #1111,btohqsg
You must go south Korea for this one,btohqsg
Toyota build a Monster car 😱,btohqsg
All good now. Thanks for the heads up JX😉-R,btohqsg
I want to see rich kor kor car,btohqsg
I waiting for a few months already,btohqsg
More impressive than Nissan and Pete combined,btohqsg
Going to wait for your next car for that statement to change,btohqsg
Nah i actually revisited the toyobaru because of the chassis,btohqsg
For context i had a BRZ before,btohqsg
When the opportunity present itself defo. Tho i recently heard my s3 CR just got into a pretty bad accident recently.,btohqsg
by the owner tht was trying to sell it?,btohqsg
or was it 2nd owner after you,btohqsg
You have discovered google! Can see more?,btohqsg
must touch the tree  run around for 20 rounds then run back,btohqsg
86 and Elise fun factor...Elise is more special.86 is alot more daily friendly. 86 is more forgiving at limit  easier to approach   enjoy the chassis and control  Elise if you dont know what you are doing it could punish you greatly  amazing steering feel. However deeply satisfying when you do nail it.That said this is applicable to manuals 86/brz. I didnt really enjoy my brz as much cos i felt without the stick driver engament level drops.,btohqsg
i see  maint wise/ parts i wld assume 86 wld be cheaper?,btohqsg
bring base model 992 pu55y car also can win 😂😂,btohqsg
Why need drag race to prove the car you have?,btohqsg
But he jio u race sia,btohqsg
Tldr.Lotus parts more expensive  accessibility not the easiest  labour is more tricky cos hoisting is not a simple task.86 parts are plenty and pretty cheap compared to other performance cars.,btohqsg
Good when diesel was cheap haha,btohqsg
Or f8 u choose for me,btohqsg
i wld assume Elise S2 would have the most parts?,btohqsg
But no one ever said they're faster than you,btohqsg
And why you want to see everyone naked,btohqsg
Hope you can get back into a lotus at some point  emira deliveries should see many evoras and Elise come onto the market,btohqsg
Doubt so  most guys are keeping their elise/exige. I wouldnt buy a evora tho...,btohqsg
Evoras are like that awkward middle child,btohqsg
Emira is based off it actually.,btohqsg
Suits that profile more I guess,btohqsg
