Hi all  I'm looking to make a airbnb booking for a month's stay in the US (~4k sgd) + return SQ tickets (~2k+) - would KrisFlyer UOB be the best option for earning miles? Already have DBS WWMC and UOB Lady's Card (Specified dining category  not travel) - thanks in advance for any help!,btohqsg

Gurus! What‚Äôs the best way to pay income tax? I haven‚Äôt used citi payall  iPayMy or cardup before. Is there any promotion for new users?,btohqsg
Done 10k deposit and 5 buy sg etf   when will receive the free share?,btohqsg
The Tier 1 and 2 Free Shares Reward will be credited within 10 working days after redeeming from POEMS Mobile 3 App > ‚ÄòRewards‚Äô  once the eligible Customers have fulfilled the requirementshttps://www.poems.com.sg/welcome-gifts/,btohqsg
Oh I deposit on 5th Mar  probably have to wait till 5th April?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say yes  because no cap and 3mpd. Pretty much all higher mpd card have a 1k-2k$ cap  and 0.4mpd beyond cap. Need to do the math to be 100% sure  but i‚Äôm pretty convinced that Krisflyer UOB will give you the most miles due to no cap and 3mpd,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer have capped tho based on your 5% MAB,btohqsg
If you are aiming for 3mpd  no cap.If you are aiming 5-6 mpd  there is cap.,btohqsg
I think that's for UOB Krisflyer *account*,btohqsg
KF debit card has cap cc no cap,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice guys  appreciate it! üôè,btohqsg
hi i‚Äôm confused - is citibank cashback or rewards better for food delivery like foodpanda?,btohqsg
Anyone on OCBC‚Äôs BCIP? I assume it‚Äôs a monthly recurring right? I noted funds usually debited from account on 17th of every month  but if 17th is NBD  then will deduct on the preceding business day. So far this month haven‚Äôt deducted yet (should be 15 March)? Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
Oh soo only payment made either on1) SIA related purchases2) Kris+ app transactionhave uncapped 3mpd?,btohqsg
Category 2 is also uncap 3mpd.,btohqsg
Most 4mpd card are capped at $1k tho.. so that makes uob kris cc with kris+ app the best way of obtaining miles?,btohqsg
Yeapp. But card like HSBC revolution earn 4mpd only any online and contactless paymentCapped only at 1kIf uob kris cc can earn uncapped 3mpd on any transaction made via the kris+ app  that would be good for really big purchases tho,btohqsg

Latest changes from Amaze to amaze card holders ?,btohqsg
yes.. biggest impact on Amaze + UOB KF for local big transactions,btohqsg
It encourages people to use it in oversea.,btohqsg
at least 1% for healthcare removed which is kinda big buff,btohqsg
But after 1k on local healthcare will still incur charge,btohqsg
Where it says healthcare no 1% ?,btohqsg
im wondering if they also removing charges for 5999? email is not being specific,btohqsg
if so  probably can amaze atome and forget about the manual trigger every month lol...,btohqsg
Gold prices retreat from historical highs  but analysts remain bullish on near-term outlookThe pullback came as investors braced themselves for a slew of policy decisions from major global central banks including the US Federal Reserve this week.But  on a year-on-year basis  gold spot and futures prices are up 8.4% and 4.2%  respectively.https://bt.sg/SGAN,btohqsg
So does this means amaze with uob rewards get affected with the 1% charges?,btohqsg
[BREAKING] From 1 Apr 2024  Instarem amaze will implement changes in 1% fees charged additionally for certain transactionsüí¥ Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze1. Removal of 1% MCC Fee on Specific Domestic Payments:- Amaze is eliminating the 1% MCC fee on domestic payments for services such as security brokers  insurance  healthcare  education  car dealers  government  and business services.- However  note that certain payments like E-wallet top-ups and EZ-Link wallet top-ups will continue to incur a 1% MCC fee.- Users can check the Merchant Category Code (MCC) of their transactions on the app.2. Introduction of New 1% Domestic Fee on SGD Transactions:- Amaze will apply a 1% fee (minimum 0.50 SGD) on monthly domestic spending exceeding 1 000 SGD when linked to a card.- Alerts will be sent via email and push notifications as users approach the fee-free cap of 1 000 SGD for domestic spending.- The fee applies to all monthly domestic spending  including refunded amounts and temporary holds by merchants.- Domestic spending below 1 000 SGD and spending when linked to a wallet will remain fee-free.3. No Changes to International Spending:- International spending in foreign currencies remains unaffected by these changes and will not count towards the 1 000 SGD fee-free cap.Follow the story in the Telegram groupüëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüó£Ô∏èüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocodeüì¢,btohqsg
So if spending in Malaysia over 1000sgd  no 1% additional charge   right,btohqsg
So how is about if I book hotel/airbnb at oversea ? Should I change sgd to oversea currency during booking?,btohqsg
Only natural  there has to be some profit-taking after 9 straight days of gains too,btohqsg
seems like not good to spend more than 1k domestically alr ü•≤,btohqsg
Those using citi rewards+amaze for mobile wallet payments like xnap and Kris+ also affected if (above $1000),btohqsg
The 1000SGD fee-free cap is applied per Amaze card right?Example:Amaze card 1 is linked to credit card 1Amaze card 2 is also linked to credit card 1Domestic spending for Amaze card 1 = $1000Domestic spending for Amaze card 2 = $200Question: will I be charged $2 (1% of $200) or I won't be charged anything?,btohqsg
I would think it is by per amaze acct,btohqsg
Jus a thought.... their monthly spending is based on calendar mth right?,btohqsg
"seems to be the case for now... though i wonder how will they ""bill the charge""",btohqsg
yes... so it is anticipated if your CRMC cycle is different.. might kenna,btohqsg
Should be since it start 1 apr then the 1k should restart 1 may,btohqsg
just like the 1% currently... the moment u spend.. you see one more line.. FEE,btohqsg
cannot be la... then every txn one charge above if accumulated over 1k meh  dam pain wor,btohqsg
What is the best broker to buy stock in Sg ?,btohqsg
Oh well they just want to earn from fcy and not to let user earn 4mpd from conversion to online for local spending,btohqsg
err yes.. that is the point,btohqsg
‚ò†Ô∏è - reality kicking in -,btohqsg
Luckily HSBC revo is visa card... still can do double card combo for hsbc and citi+amaze,btohqsg
