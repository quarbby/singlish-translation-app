You can see random infanteers proning behind a tree,btohqsg
U sure know a lot about army for a seaman,btohqsg
What is the topic of the essay?,btohqsg
I just thought of it as a benifit of technology hahhaa,btohqsg
It will be an honour to meet John Smith in person!,btohqsg
I have the great honour of being in 12 groups with him!,btohqsg
Only few of us have had the honour of seeing the legendary Smith in person,btohqsg
Just create another secret group with only you and him,btohqsg
Random qn  which part of NUS Science are you planning to enter?,btohqsg
Look at which qn he answer the most in the hw group,btohqsg
When can I expect your work in Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics,btohqsg
well route to test tube washer leggo,btohqsg
Can't find relevant benefits to human other than he jiankui's claim and possible benefits that is derived from rat tests.If this is due to crispr  you can write about scientist uncovering embryonic stem cell's mechanism to undergo proliferation and self renewal,btohqsg
Aspiring to be anyone in particular,btohqsg
planning to do Physicd as a major after I finish NS. I don't mind teaching but that is not really my main goal  more towards nanotechnology and optics,btohqsg
Nanotech and Optics that is oddly specific,btohqsg
But I can't really go NUS but got offer from NTU,btohqsg
Its good to explore the world first before settling on teaching as an eventual  and final career.,btohqsg
Yea  my score not high enuf,btohqsg
i'm going nus science to major in computer science,btohqsg
Yea but damn this year uni application is competitive,btohqsg
I'm going Science NUS to major in Astronomia,btohqsg
But legit have such ppl ma,btohqsg
This reminds me of how in Lucifer  every episode begins with lucifer making a statement he believes his life is like  and the episode is all about proving him wrong,btohqsg
Thats why u wait for next year will be better,btohqsg
I’ve got an offer for nus physics,btohqsg
I was thinking of the matrix instead,btohqsg
U can either choose the blue pill  or the red pill.,btohqsg
AKA you get fked if you're not 'the one?',btohqsg
actually what did you guys learn about the difference between ntu and nus physics,btohqsg
Actually funny story  I had aspirations of doing science and acting lol,btohqsg
"""Wearable"" devices huh... 😳 racy indeed",btohqsg
They got me interested in it hahha,btohqsg
And idk what to do in the future anyway,btohqsg
Most people compare engineering and physics,btohqsg
And then i am like er...engineering or physics,btohqsg
Actually most people say engineering have physics,btohqsg
Is like saying biz is same as econs,btohqsg
Only engineers are qualified to wear helmets in plants,btohqsg
Only Engineering Science is true engineering,btohqsg
The one in physics course is alot more theoretical thoughh,btohqsg
How bout econs is part of biz,btohqsg
N physics is part of engi,btohqsg
I’d sooner say Econs is applied mathematics,btohqsg
Nearly every stem field is just applied math,btohqsg
By the transitive property  most fields are applied philosophy,btohqsg
No  because a guy and a girl makes a couple,btohqsg
What does it mean to be true?,btohqsg
Are we bornt due to social construct?,btohqsg
We are born in a society,btohqsg
Is the idea of society a product of social construct?,btohqsg
First off  what’s a social construct,btohqsg
This is my countryyyyy this is my frieeeend...eh wait is this the correct song,btohqsg
A social construct is something that Civil Engineers work very hard to build and maintain,btohqsg
We are about to be forced to wear a tracking device,btohqsg
"""Those who would give up essential liberty  to purchase a little temporary safety  deserve neither liberty nor safety.""/s",btohqsg
I suppose they see that Singaporeans are very easily placated,btohqsg
They'll probably hold the elections this year,btohqsg
What is the likelihood PAP is not elected,btohqsg
Someone do some Maximum Likelihood Estimate pls,btohqsg
Is anyone here willing to give up their fundamental rights to being a free person to a mandatory law that forcibly attaches a physical device on us that blatantly tracks our locations and who we are in contact with?,btohqsg
Have you made that known to the Minister,btohqsg
Sovereign? No. I am a law abiding citizen. I've done none of the weird stuff that Kaur has been doing.,btohqsg
If u’d like to find a tutor there’s tuition telegram groups out there  but we don’t want to encourage posts like these cause it can get spammy.,btohqsg
U just search on the bar,btohqsg
I still haven't heard your fundamental rights,btohqsg
Eh but there's a case for this also  because these devices don't track your physical location  they track numbers associated with the people you interact with instead,btohqsg
By the way  if you're not Sovereign  then you presumably acknowledge the existence of this place's Constitution.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter what you say,btohqsg
They will always be disturbed  shocked  outraged and grievously injured by anything.,btohqsg
Ah yeah who am I kidding... y'all are pro-PAP folks  to your dying breaths:),btohqsg
Is the eleventh floor high enough?,btohqsg
I never said anything about my political affiliation,btohqsg
Right  it's hard to change minds,btohqsg
I dont understand how does wearing the device = Pro PAP?,btohqsg
Small animals will have achieved terminal velocity from that point,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me? Sorry aku bodoh,btohqsg
Bro  living and breathing = pro PAP,btohqsg
You see  you need to live to get a job,btohqsg
Its tough to eat u bro,btohqsg
You need to breathe to get a job,btohqsg
Getting a job is desirable in PAP's eyes,btohqsg
When breathing  you are breathing PAP air,btohqsg
HENCE YOU ARE A PAP LACKEY IF YOU GET A JOB,btohqsg
YOU WILL ONLY GROVEL AT PAP'S HEELS BY GETTING A JOB,btohqsg
So you’re saying that to be a good skeptical citizen  I should not get a job,btohqsg
Imo  i think the device is a good measure. Yes  it might be a privacy concern for some  but i place my health abv all else,btohqsg
TBH I don't think they have any ownership titles of the air but correct me if I'm wrong,btohqsg
Math is clearly not a job/s,btohqsg
I mean it's no CS  but you'll get by,btohqsg
Or pan fry and risk getting it burnt like@imindomie,btohqsg
Die die need drag u in,btohqsg
That's if you can catch me,btohqsg
Was talkin abt it earlier ^_^,btohqsg
We're still entitled to our opinions I hope,btohqsg
Nth personal in whatever i said jn,btohqsg
Except the pan frying JH part@junghon3709,btohqsg
Imo i also dont support contact wearing devices also,btohqsg
Imagine if technological warfare was a thing today  whole sg would be dead wearing that.,btohqsg
How is it not a thing,btohqsg
By technological warfare  i mean that tech can kill ppl literally,btohqsg
The device takes over the wrg,btohqsg
Dynkin Diagram  I feel like you're extremely pro-PAP. Not saying if that's a good or bad thing but let's not accuse people of all sorts of things alright? A sovereign  really? Based on the description for that I could have you for slander.,btohqsg
Yes  yes  I am extremely pro-PAP  because I have been in this group for about 2 years and have been spreading pro-PAP propaganda,btohqsg
Aiyo how can u deduce that based on this opinion only,btohqsg
Also I fail to see what you 'can have me for slander',btohqsg
Theres bound to be ppl who agree/disagree to new government initiatives,btohqsg
Understood. Go ahead and continue  alright?,btohqsg
Aiyo dun drama la... now 11pm,btohqsg
I've literally never been so approved in my life,btohqsg
Calling me a sovereign  where someone just got shamed for being a sovereign after that one video went viral,btohqsg
I've not called you a sovereign but ok,btohqsg
I can see that you have associated magical acts,btohqsg
When you submit your evidence to the Courts,btohqsg
Im sorry i used that word  i nvr meant it srsly and im sorry if i have upset you.,btohqsg
I'm not out here to fight with people but yeah pls respect my opinions thanks,btohqsg
Sorry about that  I realised... its alright,btohqsg
It depends on how defensible opinions are,btohqsg
Nothing big I'm just ruffled by the whole wearing device thing also,btohqsg
You realised that I slandered you!?,btohqsg
Eh dun fan the flame alrd la,btohqsg
This kind of small things dunnid argue one,btohqsg
Like I said... im not here to fight,btohqsg
Party all day and party all night,btohqsg
Just go with the flow i guess,btohqsg
But its sad it all came down to this,btohqsg
Will they make it a law to force us to wear it?,btohqsg
Which other country affected by covid has done the same?,btohqsg
Tbh if the tracker has a step tracker and a heartbeat sensor  I would wear it 😂,btohqsg
Which other country's ruling party can afford heavy political prices and eventually not need to pay it at all?,btohqsg
Maybe it's already within current law,btohqsg
Honestly I'd put my bets on it being current law and they just need to decide to use it or not,btohqsg
Or maybe in our pockets instead?,btohqsg
It can be anything  but I doubt it'd involve injection into the fingers,btohqsg
I have literally no idea what making people in US wear shit the government dictates actually buys,btohqsg
by 'buy' I mean  what additional help would it be to public health?,btohqsg
What can US do additionally with that kind of information?,btohqsg
Do the senators give a shit?,btohqsg
CN  they are already using a traffic light system for all citizens,btohqsg
It being wearable or not probably makes little difference,btohqsg
I don't even know if you can exist without a traffic light,btohqsg
Maybe you'll just disappear if you're not on the traffic light system,btohqsg
I actually dont get what it means,btohqsg
I don't understand what I need to explain,btohqsg
If you dont mind could u paraphrase,btohqsg
"Without the ""China"" first word you probably won't get relevant results",btohqsg
Re: US is just my speculation,btohqsg
Unless you want to go into the deep end of speculation,btohqsg
Which the Internet has plenty of,btohqsg
Why is there so many people fluent in mandarin whereas I can't score a B grade for mandarin in my life 😭,btohqsg
I can't understand a single thing that is related to the essay 😔,btohqsg
I got a C6 for Chinese and S for H1 Chinese,btohqsg
And tbh I agree with you.,btohqsg
How I wished I can abandon my Chinese,btohqsg
Agreed but really I think the only way is to practice more or learn more Chinese phrases and words and see more model essays and highlight flowery phrases and words,btohqsg
Ah reading something and not understanding nearly everything is indeed an exhilarating moment,btohqsg
I hope that the bellcurve god will spare my Chinese grades,btohqsg
I wouldn't consider myself a zaikia because my Chinese is pretty shit,btohqsg
I didn't have a particular course in mind.,btohqsg
Oh  what about you? How was your n level results like?,btohqsg
Wait a minute  your Chinese grade for n level is 3?,btohqsg
But most Singaporeans struggle with Chinese right?,btohqsg
It is getting late  I'm going to sleep  good night!,btohqsg
Yea but language is probably i would say have to develop since young,btohqsg
Hard to from primary 1-sec 3 dont care chinese,btohqsg
Then suddenly sec 4 become A1,btohqsg
The good thing about language exams is that they follow certain formats you can play,btohqsg
I studied so hard for chinese in sec 4 for 6 months and only got c5. was lazy from sec 1 to 3 though😂,btohqsg
I did HMT for psle... how ironic. A for PSLE too 😂,btohqsg
My sec 1 to sec 3 teachers sucked,btohqsg
But I Can speak Chinese fine,btohqsg
Gonna catch up on my chinese next time if needed ba,btohqsg
But yeah it is good to know mor languages 👍👍👍,btohqsg
i think it should be painful death,btohqsg
considering it messes up your K+ ion gradient,btohqsg
Not bad  I still at A Level,btohqsg
Anyone here is participating in math olympiad?,btohqsg
U can pay on the spot,btohqsg
My friend didn’t pay but showed up,btohqsg
But u pay the full amount  which is about $2 more,btohqsg
Did your school not chase after you to pay $8?,btohqsg
I wish that math olympiad is cancelled because I don't feel like doing the paper 😭,btohqsg
It turns out that true maths is done in collaboration rather than competition,btohqsg
After I attempted 2018 senior round paper  I feel so dumb 😢,btohqsg
But when you know those tricks  a lot of the questions become trivial,btohqsg
Why does this work like that,btohqsg
Sum of clockwise moments = sum of anti clockwise moments,btohqsg
Yea but first part why got 1time something,btohqsg
Thats the distance from F to the pivot,btohqsg
Oh it says uniform metre ruler,btohqsg
It’s 1m doesn’t mean it’s a ruler,btohqsg
That’s the reason why there’s another word for the ruler.. the rule..,btohqsg
@chemceryou are using a hina profile picture?,btohqsg
Said you'd be there for me through everything,btohqsg
Idk I didnt pay for 2 years.,btohqsg
Hmm... even if I join  prob cant win anything probably,btohqsg
2 years try  only honourable mention lol,btohqsg
In pri sch when I join 😂,btohqsg
I got participation the first year I went for SMO cause I choked,btohqsg
I got one participation  one honourable. It's okay.,btohqsg
Second year I went to have fun and got honourable mention,btohqsg
He went there to play and still won  he's a genius,btohqsg
SMO doesn’t go by merit though,btohqsg
Yeah its basically saying u didnt fail that badly,btohqsg
Ooo  cos other oltmpid Got gold silver bronze merit,btohqsg
The maths olympiad lessons school gives are crap thou. How they expect a sec 3 to learn every single trigo topic in the syllabus in an hour,btohqsg
I lucked out also for last year chem O,btohqsg
It’s an Olympiad class for a reason,btohqsg
For chem Olympiad they going thru one chapter one lesson in 1.5h,btohqsg
Than for uni chapters 3hour once a week,btohqsg
Yeah but do they really expect u to remember 20 formulas at once,btohqsg
They have a special Olympiad team,btohqsg
Some sec 3s are better than me at maths,btohqsg
And ask people from oversea to go Olympiad,btohqsg
Is H3 math harder or math Olympiad harder,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionif u do the math Olympiad now do u think u can get silver/gold?,btohqsg
Australian is so much easier lol,btohqsg
Olympiad is weird cause you actually need to train for the test,btohqsg
My school have one china scholar,btohqsg
So if you’re not learning the topics Olympiad tests  you won’t do well,btohqsg
hi guys how to save googleclassroom recordings the teachers post if i get kicked out of the class,btohqsg
Apparently he's the best in math in southern Asia or smt in some Australia quiz,btohqsg
I didnt. After 15 mins  I did all the questions that I knew how to do  but it explains the honourable thou,btohqsg
And he was the only silver in my school for SMO,btohqsg
But I have this friend from hwachong,btohqsg
He was like top 10 in chem Olympiad in sec sch,btohqsg
Now he also got gold for Olympiad  going for IChO,btohqsg
Dont schools pay for u to enter olympiad thou,btohqsg
My sch send the entire class for chem O to go,btohqsg
That's cancelled this year too rite,btohqsg
I don't understand why they cant,btohqsg
Do the test online or smt,btohqsg
And I know bedok confirm will send the question to this group and ask fuzzy to help him if it's an online Olympiad,btohqsg
Nobody likes CS  not even the people that apply for it,btohqsg
I only want to learn how to fix computer,btohqsg
Idk what field of science is that hahaa,btohqsg
Do u want to learn computational thinking?,btohqsg
Have you tried turning it off and on yet,btohqsg
The mother board burn I think,btohqsg
Cos I game for too long,btohqsg
How do you even burn your Mobo,btohqsg
Idk  when I ask repair person they say it's burn or smt,btohqsg
Even under prolonged stress a typical Mobo isn't expected to burn,btohqsg
Idk  it happen two years ago,btohqsg
Oo then maybe possible I geuss,btohqsg
But I legit smell cooked plastic,btohqsg
And all my files and folders 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
He run ben leong code confirm,btohqsg
Eh ben leong got some role in ioi next year,btohqsg
Hes taking over the entire industry in sg,btohqsg
Monopolisation is agaisnt the law tho,btohqsg
He want to come back to nus full time,btohqsg
Ben Leong is a Malaysian professional golfer. Leong won the Asian Tour qualifying school in 2006  and after a poor debut season won again in 2007. H,btohqsg
Waow  so many tricks which I realised and I didn't think of it before 😵,btohqsg
I let go. Lost in oblivion,btohqsg
I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom,btohqsg
Not as dark as my soul#edgy,btohqsg
Soulborne is overrated don't @ me,btohqsg
Looking into the future of dark,btohqsg
Dark souls is not for short tempered ppl,btohqsg
Dark souls is for long tempered people,btohqsg
I throw my temper for one year,btohqsg
this is so depressing but I like it,btohqsg
Its from fight club if you havent seen it,btohqsg
It's to be able to hold it in,btohqsg
What if i get you ice cream,btohqsg
Think about the consequences that will happen if you really got angry,btohqsg
you spiting minghui is it hahaha,btohqsg
But what happens if you always angry,btohqsg
then you need to calm yo tits,btohqsg
Then I have no more pants,btohqsg
Angry always for what waste your energy,btohqsg
He definitely held a grudge against me,btohqsg
It probably has melted ice cream all over it,btohqsg
Maybe some people have infinite amounts of energy,btohqsg
Yeah but you like it dont you,btohqsg
They are like perpetual motion machines hiding in plain sight,btohqsg
Energy cannot be created nor destroyed,btohqsg
As long as you are able to break time translation symmetry  this shit doesn't hold,btohqsg
But it can be eaten many times,btohqsg
This Pepe is a perpetual motion machine,btohqsg
I'd like to meet that person,btohqsg
Must be a marvel character or smtg,btohqsg
If so  then we have proof that there is no time translation symmetry,btohqsg
But when you get killed  you die,btohqsg
Can i ask after N levels if you wana study IB is the only route to do Os then go to an IB school? Or are there IB international schools that accepts you base on N level results?,btohqsg
International schools don’t accept Singaporeans I believe,btohqsg
Then why national schools accept foreigners?,btohqsg
Only Singaporeans returning from overseas can go to international school,btohqsg
Overseas Singaporeans not counted as Singaporeans?,btohqsg
Since international schools don't accept Singaporeans  and national schools accept foreigners??,btohqsg
they dw them to leave sg,btohqsg
I see  meaning the only route for local students doing N levels is to sit for Os then to go IB?,btohqsg
U go overseas better. SG likes angmoh degrees,btohqsg
The more angmoh the degree is the more love u get,btohqsg
Wish you happiness and prosperity and success,btohqsg
Nah not me just asking for a friend,btohqsg
Then pass it to your friend,btohqsg
Yea i think i got it right,btohqsg
Though going overseas seems attractive imo,btohqsg
Sg is like a slum where all dreams die,btohqsg
Yea if u have money wads covid man,btohqsg
But its ok if your dreams dont come true,btohqsg
Walk around in a hazmat suit with portable aircon,btohqsg
Having a dream gives you a push,btohqsg
U need to get special approval from MOE,btohqsg
How do you go abt doing that?,btohqsg
Show results that u can excel way better else where?,btohqsg
U just apply to the school,btohqsg
Then the school will refer you to MOE,btohqsg
Or rather refer your application to MOE,btohqsg
But it’s meant for returning Singaporeans anyway,btohqsg
Actually its funny how foriegners find singapore stable and prosperous while every other singaporean ik wants to escape singapore,btohqsg
Grass is greener on the other side,btohqsg
But only when u lookdown u realise that grass is below u also,btohqsg
Just coz ur neck doesnt allow u to look down,btohqsg
Doesnt mean grass below u not green,btohqsg
Thts one way to look at it jesus,btohqsg
Well other country grass is certainly greener imo,btohqsg
How you know for sure the grass is grass,btohqsg
Some big brain converstion im not prepared to handle,btohqsg
Also well to each his own,btohqsg
You can be anything if youre not afraid,btohqsg
Anyth more i say this chat will become HWZ or /r/sg,btohqsg
Well they dont thats why they are here,btohqsg
Thats why idw to type haha,btohqsg
I cant handle their big brain logic,btohqsg
Correction  I just found out about ‘privately funded schools’,btohqsg
Yass my dream to study at CIS is still alive,btohqsg
There are 3 of them  ACS  SJI  and HCI international schools,btohqsg
Only these 3 international schools accept locals,btohqsg
And indeed they offer the IB,btohqsg
Acs is actually fucking god tier from what i heard,btohqsg
Yeah have u seen their prom,btohqsg
acs international... shouldn't be too far off from acsi right?,btohqsg
But oh well where got the moolah,btohqsg
Their school is so racially diverse,btohqsg
we get to interact with people from different countries,btohqsg
Not even close  if you’re referring to IB grades,btohqsg
so it's up to your effort tbh,btohqsg
I'm poor so I just take a bus across the causeway,btohqsg
Indep mean point is like 42,btohqsg
But indep is like the second best IB school in the world anyway,btohqsg
But i tell u most of the int sch people,btohqsg
My teaching intern mate got 44 also,btohqsg
Dont they say that about us too?,btohqsg
I just want to go to a cafe  sit down and drink some coffee,btohqsg
Do they ? Most int friends i have dont say that,btohqsg
Must be i mingling w wrong ppl,btohqsg
My mother warned me about them,btohqsg
The travellers are fucking street smart dont get me wrong,btohqsg
I mean it's the general consensus around the world. We lack creativity and only know how to study,btohqsg
But those who havnt left the comfort of their parents riches arent really,btohqsg
Like there's quite a few who are dumb as bricks  especially the Ang moh teenage guys studying here,btohqsg
Oh  if you're going by that category  they're definitely not street smart,btohqsg
Ur squad mate doesnt even know how to iron or polish. I do it for him,btohqsg
The one who fucked us over for bunk inspection this week???,btohqsg
LOL trying not to mention names here  but the one who keeps wishing he was on LD?,btohqsg
Ironing and polishing is as easy as watching others do  or a YouTube video helps too,btohqsg
Its not a life skill he needs he says,btohqsg
He has people to do it for him,btohqsg
Same for a lot of ppl ik,btohqsg
But need Os results right? N level only cannot right?,btohqsg
I’m sure the rules for such schools are more flexible,btohqsg
R u saying its PTW sch?,btohqsg
Well  ACS has a part in it,btohqsg
I see  i guess money makes the world goes round then,btohqsg
SJI Int has different criteria to get in,btohqsg
PTW as in pay to win?,btohqsg
And the application fee itself is $2000,btohqsg
What's the pros of paying so much to go to int schools thou,btohqsg
U get to mix with other rich people I suppose,btohqsg
Wow gaming terms on academic qnses. God level creativity,btohqsg
I wont say the teachers are good or students are nicer,btohqsg
The sch opposite my sch is int sch,btohqsg
IB is not good if you intend to study in SG,btohqsg
And the students are fucking rude and dumb af,btohqsg
Real SJI and ACSI have inflated the grades for IB in SG a lot,btohqsg
Hmm... ok. Do singaporeans actually go there thou,btohqsg
I speak mainly for SJI Int  cuz they have good teachers,btohqsg
I have a friend who went to CIS,btohqsg
I know the students  they legit act superior compared to schools like GESS and UWC,btohqsg
Yea i have friends there. All from moola,btohqsg
Ik we interact w em everyday,btohqsg
Rich people don’t have to worry about prestige,btohqsg
Idk lol. Maybe I'm just too poor to understand,btohqsg
So don’t need to aim for prestige,btohqsg
They just needa be sure who they wana procreate with,btohqsg
UWC students are actually nicest so far that ive met,btohqsg
Their sch culture is actually quite multiracial,btohqsg
Wad are the requirements to go SJI? Can u share pls?,btohqsg
SJI Int? Super high  you need to have good grades throughout your school life,btohqsg
Reminds me of when in a debate competition we had SJI vs SJI(I),btohqsg
Haha ok noted then its improbable for my friend alr,btohqsg
Tell him ACSI or literally anyone other one  as long as he still have money,btohqsg
The only other one is HCIS,btohqsg
Idk why all the people ive met from there are shallow af,btohqsg
I know alot of prcs though,btohqsg
Wait wat on earth is HCIS,btohqsg
I learned the acronym without learning the name,btohqsg
So even with N levels u just ptw and it unlocks a new world?,btohqsg
They have prc but the local ppl there are a bit weird idk maybe is just my experience,btohqsg
Nothing u can’t do with money,btohqsg
Don't go Sji int unless he wants to part with 50k a year,btohqsg
money makes the world go round,btohqsg
Cant even imagine parting with 50 dollars,btohqsg
And make girls call u daddy,btohqsg
the one time neil speaks sense,btohqsg
I always make sense what r u talking about,btohqsg
I think his family can afford  just the grades and smarts part,btohqsg
Lolz  why does he wanna go int school anyway,btohqsg
He is v hardworking though so just wana help him out a lil by checking,btohqsg
Seems like a lot of trouble,btohqsg
Being a fabulous human is expensive,btohqsg
Oh well  just do well and go to normal SJI,btohqsg
Dont need to deal with Singaporeans as much,btohqsg
True la needa have a level of calibre also if not its gonna be a struggle even with money,btohqsg
Yeah  they're teachers are good (mostly) and don't need to spend so much money,btohqsg
"So you're telling me your friend wants to part with 50k per year just so he can ""deal with Singaporeans less""?",btohqsg
Not only is he stupid but also hes going to what hea trying to run away from,btohqsg
There’s nothing in an international school worth 50k a year,btohqsg
People who r willing to pay don’t really see 50k as a lot,btohqsg
If he's Singaporean  he's running towards NS in the end too,btohqsg
U are talking abt tanglin int trust sch,btohqsg
Money makes money i guess. But if u dont have a character ull actually end up getting bullied,btohqsg
Their other 20k is for international trips and miscellaneous,btohqsg
Ppl pay cos their parents are CEOs. They pay to just network lol,btohqsg
U just need a well stock liquor cabinet and free access to host parties,btohqsg
