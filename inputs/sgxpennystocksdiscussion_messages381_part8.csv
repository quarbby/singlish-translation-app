Hug for deal completionRisk of falling through or delay. Pain to share priceCurrent level minimal downside imo but own trading plan and risk appetite,btohqsg

Sept 20 news: MOU signed. So far no updates on this development. Should be expecting some soon. Believe this should be the big play for Hong Lai Huat. First round accumulated by players already back then when they rose almost 100% the following day after this piece of news.Not so much for trading.Mid to long term more ideal.https://scandasia.com/the-danishskiold-signs-strategic-partnership-alliance-with-singaporean-hong-lai-huat-group/,btohqsg

Highlight of the announcementThat‚Äôs a $13m cash inflow. Reversal of accumulated losses is non-cash item. I just count the sale consideration of 1.2m and 12m of loans,btohqsg
Not a reliable figure since they have since completed a rights issue,btohqsg
