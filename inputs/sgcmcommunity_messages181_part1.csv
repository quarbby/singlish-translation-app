or did you cherry pick PI price for cheapest A200 then compare it to borneos ES300h price which is a totally different and higher tier car?,btohqsg
A Class and ES are 2 diff cat,btohqsg
yes C&C A class vs Borneo ES,btohqsg
To compare  u need to compare C and IS,btohqsg
i think i have gone on about this long enough,btohqsg
ES is at E class n 5 Series cat,btohqsg
A class is just a hatch w a backside,btohqsg
you compared an A180 to an ES300h,btohqsg
you literally did not read a single thing i said,btohqsg
did you read what i said?,btohqsg
could you do me a favour and scroll up?,btohqsg
anyway  i have nothing further to add,btohqsg
dealer pricelist thats all they have. U comparing the screenshot from SGCM? that one isnt accurate,btohqsg
if you want to create your own cars to compare. be my guest  but thats not the comparison i made  so do me a favour and keep me out of it,btohqsg
have fun  compare tiers all you like. just dont put words in my mouth and get me involved unnecessarily,btohqsg
you don't know what you are comparing,btohqsg
ES250 is not an ES300h  and A180 is not an A200 from C & C,btohqsg
i cant make it any clearer than that. you dont get it  and im not going to try and convince you,btohqsg
why do you even bother with arguments trying to compare apple vs orange is beyond me,btohqsg
and all this started with me  simply thinking the ES300h has a nice interior  since i've sat in one.,btohqsg
the tiers these people are mostly imagined. i went purely on price. some guys here are so damn triggered and honestly i am perplexed why this is the case,btohqsg
i can reverse it and say  people who need a large sedan cant afford an E class  so they get an ES,btohqsg
thats your opinion and you are entitled to it. see how i am not in the least bit bothered by it?,btohqsg
try doing that next time  life will be much nicer,btohqsg
i don't think anyone is bothered by your comparison either. we are just trying to educate you that you are not comparing apples with apples,btohqsg
i happen to think a 6 cyl e class is actually a very nice car,btohqsg
But seriously two different tier car. Can't compare,btohqsg
the only education i have recieved is that a lot of people here are very emotionally attached and some others have trouble with reading comprehension,btohqsg
Price list is not accurate. A lot of overtrade and so called discount component. A200 definitely not $300k car,btohqsg
i think thats what most people have been trying to tell him,btohqsg
comparison requires an objective standard. otherwise we can anyhow cook whatever price we want based on the discount we can expect. borneo does give discounts too. official numbers are the best way to compare. that is my opinion and i am not triggered if some people feel differently,btohqsg
Ya lo. Need to visit the AD  only will know,btohqsg
not once did you even insinuate anything close to that btw,btohqsg
The you don't reply already la,btohqsg
its people keep replying to me leh,btohqsg
saying all sorts of stuff i did not say and not reading what i said earlier lol,btohqsg
Apologies if it‚Äôs the wrong place to post. But any help would be appreciated. Anybody knows what‚Äôs this bug? It‚Äôs inside the vent of my laptop and my laptop is in my car. Not sure if there infestation in my car,btohqsg
Do fumigation for your car ba,btohqsg
If you don't wanna do yourself can find someone to do for you on carousell  otherwise buy a can and DIY quite cheap on shopee,btohqsg
Even if you don't eat in the car also still can kena... Normal lol,btohqsg
Looks like a cockroach. It's suggested to do fumigation of your car. It'll fully kill any insects hiding in your car. Traps are not as effective.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôll have to pick up their dead bodies ü§Æ,btohqsg
Like I said find a fumigation service they'll do that for you.. just pay a bit more,btohqsg
There are some car wash shops in JB that provides this service. At same time  they'll fully clean and maintain the insides.,btohqsg
Just do a google search for those in JB. SG also have but will be more expensive.,btohqsg
Cockroach  sometimes if you park near drain they will enter your car through the air vent,btohqsg
Especially when the area you are parking in doing the fumigation  sometimes the roaches run to the car to hide,btohqsg
Better do the car fumigation  if you unlucky and have a mother roach entering the vehicle. Have big chance that it has laid eggs in your car,btohqsg
I agree. I never had any cockroach in my car until I sent it in for sound proofing installation. First day of driving  I saw one running across the dashboard. So I can guess where it came from. Just send in to fumigate clean  no more roaches.,btohqsg
Omg will do so asap. Thanks all üôèüèº,btohqsg
