The Board of Directors of Golden Energy and Resources Limited (the “Company” or ‘GEAR”)wishes to update shareholders on the following development relating to its subsidiary  PTBorneo Indobara (“BIB”).On 7 August 2021  Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (“MEMR”) releaseda list of 34 companies banned from exporting coal due to potentially not fulfilling theircontractual coal supply obligations to state-owned electric utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara(“PLN”) and its affiliates during the first seven months of 2021. BIB was one of the companiesincluded in the list.Following the news of the proposed export ban  BIB commenced discussions with MEMR toclarify its potential areas of non-compliance.On 8 August 2021  MEMR  upon further assessment arising from the discussions with BIB informed BIB that its export ban was lifted. The assessment took into consideration BIB’scompletion of a 55 000-ton coal shipment to PLN which had been scheduled for late July butwas inadvertently delayed by a few days to early August. This completed shipment ensuredthat BIB met its coal supply obligations to PLN for the first seven months of 2021.This matter has been resolved with MEMR and does not have any impact on the business andoperations of BIB and GEAR.,btohqsg
