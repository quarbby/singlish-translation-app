Sorry like to consult the gurus here. If I were to apply for the HSBC live+ card through singsaver then travelone  my understanding is that I can get the rewards for both. But if I apply direct from hsbc  it seems that I can only get either one. Is my understanding correct please? What if I apply through the bank first and then singsaver for the travelone card  would I still get both rewards please? Thank you for replying in advance.,btohqsg

Oh I mean apply for HSBC live+ first then travelone.,btohqsg
Or I should say hsbc live+ followed by travelone card.,btohqsg

If spend can hit $800 in Fcy n can arrange payment method between contactless and (mobile contactless/online) freely  UOB Evol actually is not a bad choice.$50(cashback)/$800 => 6.25%Fcy Spread 3.25%Net gain = 3%,btohqsg

Hello experts  does anyone know the difference between local set phones and overseas set phones sold on shopee phone sellers?The price difference can be quite big sometimes  so I wonder if theres actually a difference we need to take note of?,btohqsg
I saw that eligible spend excludes the following  which suggests the transactions I mentioned could be eligible for free parking:(a) Charges that are processed and billed prior to your CapitaStar Member enrolmentdate or charges that are prepaid on any Card Account prior to the first billingstatement for that Card Account following the Enrolment Date;(b) Second and subsequent transactions made with American Express instalments;(c) Cash Advances and other cash services;(d) Express Cash;(e) American Express Travelers Cheque purchases;(f) Charges for dishonoured cheques;(g) Finance charges including Line of Credit charges and Credit Card interest charges;(h) Late Payment and collection charges;(i) Tax refunds from overseas purchases;(j) Balance Transfers;(k) Annual Card fees;(l) Other credits to your Account; and(m) Physical CapitaVoucher purchases.Hence  just asking for data point from anyone who managed to qualify based on the transactions I mentioned  which are now commonly excluded from many credit cards.,btohqsg
Which phone and which market set? Some overseas set may not have full network support in Singapore  result in slower/less stable connection. Ofc many phones dont have international warranty so your phone is not covered when there are issues,btohqsg
S24 Ultra  seller mention is global set probably from HK. I'm using it day to day in SG and also on my upcoming overseas trips.,btohqsg
