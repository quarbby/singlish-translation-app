thats why they call it sa1 and prelim lmao- technically it escapes the restriction but by right itâ€™s basically a full fledged prelim minus a few topics not yet covered,btohqsg
what does ur schedule look like,btohqsg
Well  my schedule for Os was I reserve my Sunday for a day of sanctity (break and interest) while I grind on the rest. Basically I dedicate a day of revision to each faculty of subject (i.e. combined humans on one day while EL and MT will be on the same day). Every break I had  I would use to work on my weakest subject at that point in time - Comb. Sci. (Phy./Chm.) & Mathematics.,btohqsg
it's either math or sci for R2 and R3 iirc,btohqsg
so if u hv double math can completely don't count,btohqsg
A science is compulsory in your computation,btohqsg
I got double humanities double sci triple math and,btohqsg
Ur R2 and R3 has to be math or sci,btohqsg
I hate to say this but I nid to use one of each,btohqsg
L1R5 = English   math   pure geog   ss/lit   dNT   cl like that,btohqsg
U take so many fr what,btohqsg

U tell me poa at least can take accounting in mi ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I do not mean to be rude but if you're planning to go to a JC/MI  I strongly suggest for you to drop D&T. I did that back then.,btohqsg
Actually  yes  I was horrible in POA but I'm doing well for PAA.,btohqsg
Nani   then why they put math or sci ?,btohqsg
"L1R5 isnt a number  its a mindset ;"")",btohqsg
Okay i took os last year i might hv forgottenBut afaik itsL1- EL/HMTR1- Humanities (pure hist  geog  lit)  chums too  3rd langR2- math/sciR3- math/sciR4-any other olvl subj,btohqsg
Lets identify ourselves as our L1R4,btohqsg
Its only a number when u score bad like me LOL,btohqsg
I had ppl telling me L1R4 is useless like ok shut up let me hv my moment,btohqsg
They say anyone 1   so ainâ€™t it can double huankities,btohqsg
i love to think about it that way but then reality hits and you realise that a lot of stuff depend on getting a good l1r5,btohqsg
ELR2B2 mostly for like sci engineering design no?,btohqsg
Thats why irs a mindset... Until you score badly,btohqsg
The others like business and humanities also use L1R4,btohqsg
