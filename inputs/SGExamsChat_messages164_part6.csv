But some other groups have more teacher,btohqsg
Most ppl get only 2 ppl,btohqsg
Some suay ones get up to 6,btohqsg
Yea for some groups is internal examiner  but the standard is decided by the groups that are externally moderated,btohqsg
No la thats not true also,btohqsg
Regardless of internal/external examiners for op,btohqsg
Ur overall score is externally moderated,btohqsg
If suey suey they choose the good groups as standard,btohqsg
Den all the others gg sia,btohqsg
I only heard from my pw teacher everything mark by own school teacher,btohqsg
No la if they chose a good group  the group will get A  but it doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else cannot get A,btohqsg
So technically the grade decide by the sch?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I think no matter how they moderate if you have a good presentation you‚Äôll be fine,btohqsg
That's the issue  I remember Anderson distinction rate were damn low,btohqsg
Like the entire class only have like 1-2 distincrion,btohqsg
Look at the marking rubrics and drag  randos to listen to your presentation,btohqsg
My friend who present way better than me  English A1 since sec 1,btohqsg
For my school there are classes with only 1-2 B and the rest A and classes where only 1-2 groups get A,btohqsg
That's why I feel has to due to the sch,btohqsg
I mean even if u get B  there‚Äôs all the other papers next year that will have a larger impact on your overall grades so,btohqsg
Besides maybe this year they‚Äôll be more lenient cos the covid thing might‚Äôve affected whether you can practice more as a group (idk cos I didn‚Äôt take pw this year),btohqsg
Thats a 180 on what the other guy said haha,btohqsg
SEAB people coming in to watch your OP and film it for external moderation,btohqsg
