i put 1 choice only cuz the rest of the choices super unrelated to the course i wanted to take,btohqsg
Can always call up the principal of the school and have a “nice talk”,btohqsg
if u never get pol sci and dumped into some random dump truck  you’ll be more depressed,btohqsg

they throw u do patrol la,btohqsg
u have fun patrolling sgt ryan,btohqsg
the L in kuro is L,btohqsg
to be fair the old building isnt that far either,btohqsg
From what I’ve heard  most of the ns police either serve as the counter person at police stations or ride with a officer as a partner,btohqsg
If not you follow your buddies for raids,btohqsg
yea but the old building wasn't exactly NBS classes,btohqsg
WHY DOES ANYONE TRUST KURO WITH GEN Z WTF SLANGS HES THE LAST PERSON,btohqsg
so u judt want to escape ns,btohqsg
how did u come to conclude that,btohqsg
I wish u atbin poly my dear kuro,btohqsg
pull a crazy rich asians author whatever that guy name is and leave sg,btohqsg
L bozo sounds like something some y2 human resource girl will say to her bf who got her the wrong bubble tea flavour while ranting on twitter about how her life is a mess and needs more money to buy more makeup and materialistic items,btohqsg
btw kuro just wondering but do you look your age?,btohqsg

My father served 6 of his ns months as a officer at Tanah Merah ferry terminal  he told me it was the easiest shit he ever did,btohqsg
Every 2-3 hrs just receive the passengers  because he was spf...he did not even need to check anything,btohqsg
bet its cuz of how u type,btohqsg
How I see its honesty is  I just want to see where ns can bring me,btohqsg
If it can forge a police career for me? Why not,btohqsg
Dw  I won’t be a slacker,btohqsg
I’ve heard of stories of how ns servicemen are treated compared to their normal full time counterparts,btohqsg
I would trust kuro with anything,btohqsg
L Bozo this chat lit af stop giving boomer vibes,btohqsg
Damn i like the cat in the first pic,btohqsg
Dang you will be earning money,btohqsg
Remember folks.... how to get yourself to earning 100k a year,btohqsg
it's called spiritually dying in this economy  that's how,btohqsg
100k a year  is the equivalent of earning $50 a day,btohqsg
bro i keep contemplating if its worth working more than 3 days a week.,btohqsg
i fear for your working life past tertiary education,btohqsg
No you see  we are talking about the more “reasonable” 100k,btohqsg
274 a day is how dropshippers make 100k a yr,btohqsg
because most post graduates slave their week off to occupation the first 5-10 years of their adult working life..?,btohqsg
how old r u ah bro,btohqsg
don't worryim only saying this bc i'm working in an envm that absolutely does not suit me,btohqsg
I wanna be a marine biologist,btohqsg
i really be staying in a workplace i quite literally WILL FALL SICK BC OF WORK,btohqsg
im sick rn toobut thats coz I went drip 2 days lol 🤓,btohqsg
What do you guys think is the highest paying job you can get without a degree?,btohqsg
gws.... i almost fell sick last wkbut accidentally skipped work bc body was legit too tired,btohqsg
weyh fuck this tonsilitis no joke,btohqsg
swallowing saliva feels like sandpaper down your throat,btohqsg
Is this good for someone without a degree?,btohqsg
Obviously if you factoring in more dangerous jobs yea,btohqsg
thanks man im on amoxicillin antibiotics so no worries,btohqsg
The base pay of a crane operator is like 3k  but can rise up to 5K,btohqsg
overseas ppl with no deg can make more,btohqsg
okay with all this talk about qualifications  salaries and jobs I genuinely feel that there is a glaring imbalance in job preferences simply because singaporeans are somehow hardwired to aim for an office job. a white collar job in an airconditioned environment that pays wellwhy???,btohqsg
other countries such as australia and germany really pay their blue collar workers well reaching upwards of 6k a month,btohqsg
thats the hard work of it,btohqsg
dont aim to be doing it when your 40+,btohqsg
siala that means sporeans are used to just sitting and walking..hard labour = low pay = Mid Job,btohqsg
which is true in the sporean economy,btohqsg
but vastly diffferent in overseas economy,btohqsg
garbage cleaners in us earn 110K/yr,btohqsg
thats perpetrated by the laws that the current party implements,btohqsg
"sg is built by design to pay white collar workers more because blue collar workers are outsourced from overseas which are ""poorer"" in comparison to sg",btohqsg
commission jobs too saturated liao sia,btohqsg
which result in cheaper labour costs,btohqsg
Wait nvm the watchmojo vid might be cap,btohqsg
u rly trust in the watchmojo huh,btohqsg
i tell you what is not cap  100k/yr for a postal worker,btohqsg
really cant fight with the US...they have a minimum wage model,btohqsg
their base wage means that all employers lawfully should pay ay least $12-15/hr,btohqsg
Without migrant workers we would be kinda fked,btohqsg
This is the reason why...jobs that should be paid more are paid very little,btohqsg
Minimum wage model is the reason why healthcare workers/teachers are going on strike,btohqsg
If you can get a freelance job,btohqsg
to add insult to injury...the US currently do not have the funds to fund its own people,btohqsg
You can make alot of money,btohqsg
so once in a while...you will see them shutting down their govt,btohqsg
Alot of people with no degree do cs,btohqsg
We are one of the last few countries in the world that should face a financial crisis,btohqsg
if we do...the world is really on a quick downhill spiral,btohqsg
Theres gonna be 1 billion climate change refugees btw,btohqsg
I said this on reddit before..but the only way we really can decrease our way of life is to increase the cost of another country,btohqsg
we must be precise on the country that we decide to target,btohqsg
target the wrong country...and we could be asking for trouble,btohqsg
migrant worker is like 1.50 an hour,btohqsg
idk why but i got a feeling....we are on a road with no return,btohqsg
The top 3 greatest superpowers are in conflict with each other,btohqsg
this for the first time since ww1,btohqsg
I got a feeling india is planning something,btohqsg
yea..but look at how undethered they have been,btohqsg
they have barely any sanctions against them...they have no natural disasters to hinder progress,btohqsg
i mean...not really affecting the major production houses tho,btohqsg
I hope they become better ngl,btohqsg
in 2010 the new party abolished corruption,btohqsg
seem like life is on a fast track somewhere...,btohqsg
the yolo mentality is becoming every more prevalent,btohqsg
Relax Ryan your future is good,btohqsg
its probably good..but what about my retirement?,btohqsg
bro actually will pay with his blood,btohqsg
will there be anymore tears left in our eyes?,btohqsg
We longed to be free one day,btohqsg
Is it just me kuro and ryan awake,btohqsg
its always the usual few...prob its telling us about our lives tbh,btohqsg
I am waiting to ord still :(,btohqsg
If only I make a program,btohqsg
I am gonna work 2 jobs,btohqsg
I need to study for a exam on wed..but im making this cute monster,btohqsg
I wish theres a skip button for life,btohqsg
Are you gonna fight or take the cowards way out - Death from Puss in boots,btohqsg
The higher you are the harder the fall,btohqsg
ntu biz got alot of chiobu,btohqsg
the other choice would just be to compare with yourself,btohqsg
as long as youre improving isnt that sufficient,btohqsg
but for me i'm just happy with where i got to,btohqsg
I am happy with my life,btohqsg
and aim to get better each time,btohqsg
without putting that extra unneeded stress,btohqsg
My friends got 90rp  officer etcetc,btohqsg
Why do you think your life is fked,btohqsg
if u were still a sec sch student in this era  would u prefer online tuition or still offline,btohqsg
Pocoyo dont you have school tmr,btohqsg
online if you study like crazy at home,btohqsg
I could never study at school,btohqsg
Ok if it’s like you getting tuition js to improve not necessarily A,btohqsg

I js completely don’t study unless it’s tuition,btohqsg
i started uni with less money and no portfolio too,btohqsg
Its like a first world problem bruv,btohqsg
i mean it is first world problem,btohqsg
we live in a first world LOL,btohqsg
Life is fked is more like no education and in debt or in jail,btohqsg
10k is saving an extra 30 dollars aday,btohqsg
or 6 dollars/day for 5 years,btohqsg
just think of it that way,btohqsg
ppl make dumb decisions when they're young,btohqsg
Better than losing retirement funds in ftx,btohqsg
Alot of successful businessmen ask you to fk up while young cos you have time,btohqsg
you can take the a sports science mod first and see if you can cope,btohqsg
you dont have to declare a minor straight away,btohqsg
is there anyone here younger than 16,btohqsg
you can declare the minor any time as long as you complete the modules needed,btohqsg
forget it  junwei do ur kids need swimming lessons I can either 1. Help them swim 2. Accidentally drown them,btohqsg
