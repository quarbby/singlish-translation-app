so are my SU same as single major ppl?,btohqsg
i dont mind a bit more core modules,btohqsg
Because that is dependent on the school ans your course type,btohqsg
Plus it depends on if you want to put in a lot of effort,btohqsg
P.s. you cannot su your cores  only bdes,btohqsg
"It also explains why you wld technically have ""lesser"" aus for bde than a single major",btohqsg
Wait doesnt that mean they can just su their entire bde curriculum lol,btohqsg
When in actuality the 2nd major ppl use bde for 2nd major,btohqsg
They can only su up to 12 aus,btohqsg
Phms takes only 8 aus of bde,btohqsg
12su means you can s/u all 8 right,btohqsg
They are technically allowed to do that,btohqsg
so basically single vs second major js means I have more core mods  and my BDE is fixed.,btohqsg
As a 2nd majors  yeap  your bde will be fixed,btohqsg
so i can anyhow study my data analytics and js S/U that?,btohqsg
Most of the time you can req overload to 15,btohqsg
if u taking second major you can't su your second major,btohqsg
But why would you take more aus than required lmao,btohqsg
huh  but both single and second major have 12 SU AUs,btohqsg
so i can take some funny shit also right,btohqsg
Single Major u cannot SU your Core and MPE mods,btohqsg
my friend from biological science with second major in biomedical structural science say cannot su her mods,btohqsg
she won't get her second major,btohqsg
yuxuan ur friend how old sia,btohqsg
Yea only up to 12 AU,btohqsg
Rmb 2nd major is much more than 12 aus,btohqsg
and also she say if her gpa drop below 4.5 she won't be awarded the second major,btohqsg
12 aus to s/uBut your 2nd major is abt 30 aus approx,btohqsg
A second major has about 35AUs of load,btohqsg
You can also use bde for your own school,btohqsg
So you can only SU less than half of your second major stuff,btohqsg
If u take second major your BDE is usually gone,btohqsg
my friend only have 1 mod taken as bde for her 4 years,btohqsg
Yea  unless you are lucky like some ppl  using mods that are both for core and 2nd major,btohqsg
If it's a second major her second major would be classified under BDE,btohqsg
(Of course  another limit comes out),btohqsg
So she is doing her biological sci stuff mostly,btohqsg
she taking 7 core mod this sem,btohqsg
Remember even that is up to a limit of 6AUs,btohqsg
Last sem is 5 + 2 cc,btohqsg
she got basically no bde so far,btohqsg
That would mean she's not even doing the second major yet,btohqsg
2a) Yes. Sadly. Unless your are Y1Z1 or direct Y2S1 (poly batch usually),btohqsg
She's still doing the biological science part,btohqsg
Double Maj is not second major,btohqsg
Double maj pushes the stuff to MPE and core,btohqsg
so i have to properly study 35-12 AUs?,btohqsg
Double degree is a separate thing all tgt,btohqsg
what talking you- no way am i eating 2 cakes,btohqsg
wait so if i mess up my non-BDE subjects  and get super low AU  can I pull up using my BDE?,btohqsg
