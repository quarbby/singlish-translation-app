From Singapore to Penang you ride in which terminal tho?,btohqsg
My Jetstar from Penang to Singapore was like 6am delay to 11.30am last year. So mostly depends on luck.,btohqsg
Sad thing is u don't even have duty free to drown out your sorrow,btohqsg
Singapore one should technically have it? ü§î,btohqsg
No allowance if arrival from Malaysia,btohqsg
