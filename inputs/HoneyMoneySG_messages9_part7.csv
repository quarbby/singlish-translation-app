I topped up $1K for 3 months for work expenses  you are using their service  why should they flag you?,btohqsg
I've been doing so with AMEX for months  no problem so far,btohqsg
Hi all  is paying groceries using FairPrice app considered online transaction (for citibank rewards card)?,btohqsg
Same question for mcd order via mobile app 🤔,btohqsg
yes  I just tried that last week,btohqsg
and I believe so for MCD app,btohqsg
So i guess works for DBS WWMC too?,btohqsg
And if you want to be 100% safe  you can pay with the AMAZE card on those apps,btohqsg
Ah yes  but this still works for CRMC,btohqsg
Hi all  is paywave considered offline or online transaction?,btohqsg
If I am not wrong should be offline,btohqsg
Hi all  I am new here. May I know what’s a use case for jipay ? I just top up my JiPay with Amex thinking I can top up my ez link but realized now from discussion above that it is being nerfed.,btohqsg
What’s a good use for jipay*,btohqsg
You can still top up EZ-Link with JiPay  justno Cashback,btohqsg
Yeah that’s what I meant. What are other good ways of using Jipay ? Or are the ways similar to using Amex now since both offer similar cashback with min spend?,btohqsg
You can still earn cashback if you use the card for any meals (direct card payment to restaurants   food court) or public transport,btohqsg
Havent test whether can earn cashback if pay via fave or shopback pay,btohqsg
@MartinSeah  I'll repost your message hereHello@ChrisHMSG  please let me know any edition required for this summary of your video. I have made a summary so that I can do a follow up after watch your videos many times. Many thanks#CPF#Chris@HoneyMoneySgBEST CPF Strategies for Self-Employed Persons (SEP)SUMMARY1. Mandatory contribution 8% of your Net Trade Income (of above $18k if you are below 35yo) into Medisave account  which can help you to pay for hospital bills and your integrated shield plans with private insurers.- > See Table 1.2. Do a Retirement Sum Top up (RSTU) to get the 4% annual interest a year and be eligible for tax relief in the Special Account for (recipients below age 55) or Retirement Account (for recipients age 55 and above).Another way is to top up your family member's Special Account / Retirement Account  who did not earn more than $4k that year in order for you to be qualified  for tax relief.You can contribute up to $7k RSTU to self and another max of $7k for a total of $1 400 total tax relief.3. To enhance your CPF balances by doing a voluntary contributions to all 3 CPS Accounts : OA  MA and SA/RA.The max you can get for tax relief for your Medisave and voluntary CPF contribution will be capped at the lower of- 37% of your net trade income assessment; or- CPF relief cap of $37 740 or- Actual amount contributed by youExample :Net Trade Income : $100kCPF Relief cap : 37% * 100k = $37k.Mandatory MA (see Table 1) : 8% * 100k = $8k.Vol. Contribution Gap = $37k-$8k = $29kRSTU Top-up (to self)  = $7kTOTAL CPF RELIFE = $37K+$7=$44K wor!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-36ZR7WGESw,btohqsg
Generally correct  other than cpf tax relief cap updated to $8k per year (both rstu & vcma combined)Also  I'd prefer to VCMA first  then RSTU,btohqsg
Thanks  more options to earn cashback,btohqsg
Hey guys  I’m planning for my trip to Australia and there’s going to be a lot of travel spending  some of which will be in foreign currencies. What’s the best card for it?,btohqsg
Usuallay I use Citi Rewards + AMAZE for overseas spending  but Citi Rewards doesn’t work with travel related spending,btohqsg
For other cards  even they offer 4mpd for online spending  their 3% FCY just eats up all gains🤣,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Mastercard with Amaze (assuming from your name that you're female),btohqsg
Is this only for females? Or just like DBS Women card🤣,btohqsg
I’m not the only one paying bills haha,btohqsg
Yeah Females only  Male not eligible to apply,btohqsg
"Hi all  any idea when does the 1K ""Limit"" on CRMC resets?",btohqsg
Are there any male options you'll recommend? Looking  to plan a few trips ahead too 😂,btohqsg
Hi all. I just noticed that JiPay nerfed cash back to EZ-Link top ups. Anyone else noticed this too?,btohqsg
and they even reversed previous cashback... previously the jipay referral also like that,btohqsg
Not much good option  other than Citi Cashback+ 1.6% with Amaze,btohqsg
Thanks. Guess have to review the stacking tactic again.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  guess I'll consider the use of GrabPay with AMEX combos in that case 😂,btohqsg
Actually  why not amex > grab > revolut. Save the fx fees too,btohqsg
From one of your past video  one of the bad things about revolut is the spread during the weekend. But citi caskback + can only redeem in $10 block  which is 625$ of spending.So it’s AMEX 1.5% immediate cash back  or CITI cashback + with 1.6% cashback in block of $10.So I think both way works. But what do each one prefers.,btohqsg
And I saw from a grab related GC  someone already hit the grab 30K annual spending. So do consider that as well.,btohqsg
Amex TCB? 1% on top of 1.5% ... their exchange rate is 👍🏾,btohqsg
sorry just see that it is expiring soon,btohqsg
oops  but anyway  I believe AMEX still charges FX fees  say  3%?,btohqsg
Amex>grab>jipay>revolut. Gets the you the grab points,btohqsg
I'll keep at least $250 in grab just to do jipay. With or without spending any money,btohqsg
AMEX to grab 1.5%  Grab to jipay 1.2%*. Jipay back to grab 0%  Grab to Revolut 0%.,btohqsg
