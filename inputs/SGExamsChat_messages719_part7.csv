I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
but yes they were from the same person,btohqsg
i think her going toilet was coordinated,btohqsg
apparently that entire thing was coordinated by her mom,btohqsg
What did bedok do to get muted,btohqsg
Its a copypasta of what she said,btohqsg

Which NS men hurt them 🤣 🤣,btohqsg
Me when I got shouted at by an uncle for sitting in the train even though I injured my legs :),btohqsg
We need NS-men-only cabins like how they have those for women in Japan,btohqsg
