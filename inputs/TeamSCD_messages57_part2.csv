It's slowest compared to the new ones,btohqsg
2L Vtec is still 2L vtec,btohqsg
No la I dk what to change also now adays car expensive but got consider Fd2r,btohqsg
Ohhhh FD2R depre slowly falling le,btohqsg
Ya I wait fall finish then I go see hahahahaha,btohqsg
Haha what you driving now bro ?,btohqsg
then FN2R is definitely still an improvement,btohqsg
it's a good car on its own. just that people always compare it to fd2r. similar to fk2r vs fk8r.,btohqsg
think most car would be an improvement to Perodua,btohqsg
torsion beam or not  honestly unless you going track competitively  it wouldn't matter to us average drivers.,btohqsg
dont need R also improvement le,btohqsg
for us is whether we can handle the car confidently or not.,btohqsg
without jumping to type r  swift sport is good too.,btohqsg
I considering 116i I see scd got 1 very nice,btohqsg
wah if perodua to type r thats a huge jump sia,btohqsg
If Fd2r price drop maybe can consider also,btohqsg
there is 118i to consider too. basically identical but w higher power.,btohqsg
116D torque buay pai leh can consider also,btohqsg
Ya that’s why just do the m135 bodykit,btohqsg
It will only continue to go up. Won't be coming down,btohqsg
I believe it will come down though,btohqsg
Majority fd2r driver buy with high loan and expecting COE to go up,btohqsg
All the best for the waiting,btohqsg
Since when Fd2r price will drop haha,btohqsg
M3 deprec lower den fd2r.. lol really gotta be jdm fan gao gao to get it,btohqsg
but ya always will have ppl buy la,btohqsg
now minimum 17k deprec for fd2r on sgcm lol..,btohqsg
difficult to find an fd2r with less than 6 owners too,btohqsg
Cannot. Swift sport ECU very weird one,btohqsg
Some car can use OBD gauge,btohqsg
you can take and try plug in to see if yours can or not,btohqsg
If yall need to look for a trusted workshop,btohqsg
I mean if didn’t buy it’s not a loss   Fd2r depre can buy 4.2 maser or e92 m3 alr,btohqsg
Its a kind of jdm machine for people to appreciate it.,btohqsg
That’s if u buy as a second car to enjoy or collecting but most people buy as the only car and daily drive that depre can buy many other cars though and it’s not like Fkin fast kind it’s just a very good car to go on track,btohqsg
Cars like evo all these also,btohqsg
The depre can buy supercar alr,btohqsg
COE ferrari is going for 30k+ depre,btohqsg
and people are asking 40 or 50k depre for evo,btohqsg
JDM is supposed to be cheap and be as fast as European cars.,btohqsg
Exactly I don’t deny the fact evo are sick af but how many would get a evo over a Gallardo at 40k depre if it’s within their budget just like m3 vs type r,btohqsg
haha can i just add  maybe we are in the wrong place to own good cars.,btohqsg
the depre foranycar here is crazy.,btohqsg
Ya previously was like 8-10k few years back,btohqsg
dont compare prices of sg to overseas,btohqsg
If prices of a FD2R now is as expensive as an A45 AMG  makes no sense to buy one la,btohqsg
Evo 10 was also around 8k depre years back,btohqsg
now also almost 20k i think?,btohqsg
But that said  I am guilty of buying an MX-5 for the price of a BMW Z4,btohqsg
But i really wanted manual and BMW didn't offer one. I was looking at SLK and Z4 too,btohqsg
