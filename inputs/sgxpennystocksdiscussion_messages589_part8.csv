✈️Pika World Pulse: The Travel Indstry💎🎢Travel remains strong🚥Omicron does not seem to affect the holiday season. Travel data showed that more than 2 million people had undergone security checkpoints on Monday. The data is around 80% of those levels seen in 2019.There is an expectation that travel volumes will likely remain elevated near the prepandemic period for December. Moreover  Dr Fauci indicated that it is somewhat OK to travel if one is vaccinated and wear masks in congested areas such as aeroplanes.This may boost well for recovery stocks.🛩Please cut isolation time!🛩Well  that’s the call by Delta Air Lines CEO seeking the CDC to reduce the isolation period for vaccinated people by half. Indeed  the call is understandable as staff constraints continue to dampen the momentum of services by airline companies.Given that holiday travel remains robust  any reduction in isolation time does help the airline industry.⛵️Let’s sail once again🛳Carnival CEO Arnold Donald plans to have an entire fleet of sailing in 2022 summer. This is a bold plan as the cruise company seek to normalise operation. However  it will help with the bottom line  especially with their latest cost structure that is healthier.Investors have a genuine concern  given that the debt raised during the pandemic may mean less free cash flow for shareholders in the form of dividends.We hope you enjoy this quick market pulse in the travel industry.The festive mood and  Pika World hopes everyone has a sunny day ahead!Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
