Heyhey. Diff ppl diff aesthetics. Chill,btohqsg
"It doesn't sound like aesthetics to me leh. It sounds more like  ""huh your photo so shit  but you charge market rate?""",btohqsg
people pay the market price to expect a certain amount of quality set by photos  but his is not bad la honestly,btohqsg
and why i'm actually offended by it,btohqsg
üò¨ didnt mean it to sound like that,btohqsg
time to do photographer shootout  all take photo of same car and let the audience vote,btohqsg
So yala  you're saying that his photo is not good enough to be charging for market rate la?,btohqsg
I mean I'm very fair  even if his photos aren't good enough to be charging for market rate  you don't have to voice out your opinion,btohqsg
If a chicken rice stall sucks but they charge you $10 per plate  you can just don't eat,btohqsg
@roincecchill chill  don't need defence for me lol  if he wanna shoot then let him shoot  end of the day I'm not hurt. Since I'm not paying much attention also,btohqsg
i shall withdraw my comments and keep it to myself then,btohqsg
or if you have better constructive comments  can always PM the guy and let him know how to improve,btohqsg
@stonkyboiboiactually his price is very reasonable le. 2 locations and static shots is all 2 digits price only. Those with rolling shots all this is a bit more ex. Don't forget petrol coverage. Market rate is 300^. His photos are not GOD GRADE because he is trying to improve everyday  but they are decent and most of the time out of expectations. Understand you're a photographer too. So  do understand him working his way through? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
yes definitely i understand as well,btohqsg
ben show sample of ur photo and how much u charge leh,btohqsg
I where got fierce sia  I'm just voicing my opinion,btohqsg
@stonkyboiboiinfact sometimes  (which you can ask most people) I do not even charge them money. Or gave them a big discount,btohqsg
Hmmm. I did find ben criticism quite‚Ä¶ triggering the way it was phrased,btohqsg
But anyway. Adwin is fine with it so,btohqsg
So it's not me only right,btohqsg
Damn. I wish I could get ppl to hire me for shoots. Rlly,btohqsg
yes i just noticed the way it's phrased  sounds abit üò¨,btohqsg
I keep advertising but no one wan shoot wif me,btohqsg
dunwan shoot wif u but i want shoot in u üòÅ,btohqsg
I understand you probably have no ill intentions  just don't know how to phrase it. So don't mind me getting triggered as well,btohqsg
