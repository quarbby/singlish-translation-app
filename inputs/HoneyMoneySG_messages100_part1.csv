Is there any way to split the cost of hotel into multiple parts so that cards can be used more efficiently? Can i book 1st half of duration with 1 card and 2nd half with another booking and diff card but combine the stays?What other ways around this?,btohqsg

Yes CardUp works with Maybank Platinum Visa Card. If you have $1000 worth of monthly premiums  as long $500 come from CardUp (with CardUp fee)  the remaining can come purely from Insurance.,btohqsg

Hi guys  anyone with experience using Alipay and Amaze card can help/share your experience on this please?I tried to make payment using Amaze-linked-with-uob-KF-card through Alipay app but i did not proceed to key in the Instarem Amaze SMS OTP to verify and authorise the transaction on the Alipay app. But the Instarem Amaze app now reflects that the amount is paid and the same transaction appeared as pending on my UOB app.I checked with CS of Instarem and they said that the transaction went through and is currently waiting to be claimed by the merchant. Hence  they cannot do anything about it.Does this mean the transaction is successful and i will be charged for this?Thank you!,btohqsg
Thank you all who attended Seedly PFF 2024 event!Hope you all enjoyed the sharing to accelerate your miles game‚úàÔ∏è,btohqsg
Any recording or TLDR to share with us?,btohqsg
what is the background?Why would you try to make payment and then don't proceed to key in OTP?,btohqsg
Was checking the mcc through the empty amaze wallet method then tried to make payment again but wanted to ensure that i have changed the amaze card link from wallet to uob cc so i didnt proceed with the OTP,btohqsg
actually sometimes it could just be a 'hold' on the failed transaction and money released within 1 week.so Amaze live chat said definitively it is an actual transaction and not a 'hold'?,btohqsg
Can wait for Seedly Youtube channel to share (if any),btohqsg
i encountered something rather similar in Family Mart where a failed transaction appeared in Amaze history but merchant confirmed he did not receive it (so obviously he won't be able to claim it).Within 7 days  the Amaze transaction disappeared.What I can advise u is to get confirmation / receipt from merchant showing your final mode of payment  so at least you have a record showing you actually already paid via METHOD X... then if amaze doesn't disappear  you can produce the evidence and dispute it as double charging,btohqsg
I see. Amaze said that the transaction is currently unclaimed by the merchant and if it is unclaimed within 8-14 days  it will be reversed. Not sure whether that may mean as a hold for the failed transaction. I will wait for a few days to see if it is reversed or posted,btohqsg
just make sure you retain the receipt from the China Merchant,btohqsg
Yes  don‚Äôt see in the internet banking  but wondering can select SCB,btohqsg
I see. I tried payment again after double checking the amaze card has been linked to my uob cc and my Alipay app shows only this latter transaction went through. I will monitor then. Thank you so much Mt! Really appreciate it üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Hi Credit Card Masters I‚Äôm foreigner working in Singapore about 8 years and yearly income about 45K 2 weeks ago I tried to apply UOB EVOL CC via online application  after 1 week later UOB email to me  my CC application is unsuccessful without giving any reason This is the my first time CC application in Singapore I tried to walk in UOB branches but they are keep saying that CC application is not handle by UOB branches May I know anyone have any idea why my CC application is unsuccessful and how should I do? Thanks,btohqsg
You can go to Cards and add the card under 'Singapore - VISA/MasterCard' as recipient. Then pay with your DBS bank account.,btohqsg
What is your nationality?If i am not wrong  for foreigners  the minimum income to qualify for SG credit card is $45kSo if some of your income e.g. meal allowance or overtime is not factored in by the bank  you could have fallen below the minimum statutory requirement.And UOB is well known to be stingy and conservative and cautious.Who do you bank with? where is your salary credited to? Maybe you try applying for credit card with that bank first.,btohqsg
