As of March 4  2025  determining the exact amount of funding remaining in the CHIPS and Science Act requires looking at the total allocation and the amounts awarded or committed to date. The CHIPS Act  signed into law in August 2022  provided $52.7 billion overall  with $39 billion specifically earmarked for manufacturing incentives to bolster U.S. semiconductor production. The rest supports research  development  and other programs.Based on available data up to early 2025  the U.S. Department of Commerce  which administers the CHIPS Program Office  has made significant progress in allocating these funds. By May 13  2024  Bloomberg News reported that $32.8 billion of the $39 billion manufacturing fund had been allocated. Since then  additional awards have been finalized or announced:,btohqsg
