I honestly have no idea how I actively participate I just shoot questions out my arse,btohqsg
i won’t wake you up but will smack you once class over,btohqsg
it’s a nightmare for the students if i just sit there read the solutions,btohqsg
Oh one thing i dislike that TA do is,btohqsg
They ask which questions to go through,btohqsg
And usually only the outspoken one wins because they get to choose,btohqsg
The rest of us shy ones (which is like 90% of the class) just remain silent and accept that fact,btohqsg
As in i only recall one TA doing that  to which i immediately switched off his class  but the remaining TAs i know of at least go through each question meticulously,btohqsg
Yall don't have seminar style lectures?,btohqsg
In SPMS you literally dont have to turn up for anything except mid terms and finals fr,btohqsg
i mean it depends on how many questions we have,btohqsg
Most of HSS higher level mods auto default to Seminars,btohqsg
Okay yeah that is the condition,btohqsg
I wouldnt expect yall to go through like 12 questions in a tutorial  but if its like 3 or 4  might as well talk about them all,btohqsg
for me i’d probs pick out questions i feel are the most important but if i have the ability to put out my own answers ill try to include more explanation etc,btohqsg
Unless each question require a significant amount of time,btohqsg
If the TA picks out the question I wouldn't mind that one bit,btohqsg
good catch tho. idk maybe if i have to i’ll poll it online or smth so yall can just vote,btohqsg
need to see the tutorials themselves,btohqsg
i mean those people that have further questions can just shoot me on tele,btohqsg
Youll be surprised how many students will crowd you after the tutorial ends,btohqsg
The shy ones that didnt get a chance,btohqsg
it’ll be part of my job,btohqsg
Some TAs just say no and direct me to the prof lmao,btohqsg
ehhh i’m p slow when answering questions ngl so i might be like “ill get back to you”,btohqsg
I think STEM its easier to answer directly on the spot,btohqsg
i’m just gonna give them my tele,btohqsg
Because its either conceptual or like some working problem,btohqsg
Which is why Consults with Profs for HSS is a mess cuz u have to basically be very receptive in terms of their feedback,btohqsg
It's like the most non specific things ever,btohqsg
I like consults with TAs cuz I can send em essay and I get like actual comments on the parts to improve,btohqsg
meanwhile my consults: you missed a term here,btohqsg
Had a consultation whereby the TA just corrected my citation,btohqsg
i just try to be as approachable as possible while TAing,btohqsg
don’t want to give off the “i’m just here to clock in hours” vibes,btohqsg
I think most of the SPMS TAs give off that vibe and are more than happy to help,btohqsg
Like you cant even understand their english in class  no point trying to look for them outside of class LMAO,btohqsg
My TAs are like the competent ones actually have over booked consult slots while the less useful ones are empty af,btohqsg
Do they earn money doing consultations,btohqsg
No that's why they have the right to tell students to pound sand,btohqsg
Okay honestly its nice of them to offer help but i guess they should know where to draw the line,btohqsg
Yeah the consults for TAs are a gratuity,btohqsg
But then again the higher level mods are Seminar which is why I say those are legit sink or swim,btohqsg
Cuz no TA u alone and fighting thru understand the topics solely based on the Prof itself,btohqsg
So Sem if it's a bad prof it will mess you up bad,btohqsg
It is not an art  it is a natural skill for me,btohqsg
Something u gave up long ago when u decided u wanted Permanent Head Damage,btohqsg
Easy just sleep and fail the mod,btohqsg
Even if you can hear the yapping it's bold of you to assume it even makes sense in relation to the course,btohqsg
My friend likes to make notes too like u on what the prof says,btohqsg
