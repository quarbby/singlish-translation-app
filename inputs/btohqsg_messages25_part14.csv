"Why the ""bayshireoct2024bto"" got dirty adv from Chil? I saw the adv but dare not click join the bto group.",btohqsg
I mean here has spam too 😂 all groups need to rely on people to report to admins and admins to delete,btohqsg
Those are bots with inappropriate links  never ending one. I deleted that Chii dunno how many times already haha.So don’t be scared as long as you don’t click on it. Example like phishing email or sms. You go any bto group also will see all this one not just Bayshore. Just when it will happen only.,btohqsg

The public group has already been closed. Unless you join the residents group which is a private group,btohqsg
How do i join the private group?,btohqsg
Hi all  please beware of this group  the anon admin (NOT a resident) is wreaking havoc to the project’s community and slandering  banning and insulting residents in there.https://t.me/TanglinHaltCourtyardY’all can judge for yourselves 👍🏻.,btohqsg
Coming from an admin  it’s so low.,btohqsg
It's important to keep groups verified resident-only,btohqsg
Guys  if like that case  I just no need to attend the flat application will do?The appointment is tomorrow 2pm 😅,btohqsg
i’d suggest you write to HDB to confirm your waiver of non selection as there’s < 10 units to choose from,btohqsg
U must go. Then ask them to waive,btohqsg
Invited must go down..Then if u not gonna select a unit  request to officer to waive.If u never go  they will cancelled your con current application,btohqsg
Wait for reply takes days .,btohqsg
If u have another ongoing Q number for another project  I'll tell u just go to the appt.If not they cancelled your ongoing application,btohqsg
Haha but they reject reply very fast  told them I only have 8 choices out of the  13 units. They say only can decide when it’s my turn to choose,btohqsg
"Just to ask  so must put ""watch list units"" then can see the  number of remaining units?",btohqsg
No need  click the watchlist button that is red colour to view,btohqsg
Still have another ongoing application which is Tanjong Rhu Project….,btohqsg
Very thankful for your info! It’s really help.,btohqsg
Hii  how do I navigate to this watchlist units?,btohqsg
