but margin not as wide as duxton since their BTO that time started like $300k,btohqsg
300k sold at 1m already $700k profit lol,btohqsg
can retire by downgrading to the cheapest flat in an ulu location,btohqsg
all the above average income earners in that one and only block lol,btohqsg
yeah due to the pandemic and people can't wait that long,btohqsg
only benefit to the following type of owners: sell and downsize/shift to non mature estate resale of OCR  sell before shifting to new BTO later,btohqsg
Dawson got one 3r listing at $700k woh,btohqsg
sell at good price but resale also exp since its a good time for home sellers unless the above I have mentioned,btohqsg
as there is new pandemic every decade  best is to ballot for BTO 4 years earlier,btohqsg
pandemic this time is the most jialat one right,btohqsg
understood though they can be annoying lol,btohqsg
hmm don't know what measures the gahmen is coming up with,btohqsg
if longer MOP like 10 years  then those home owners getting BTO who are going after profits GG liao lor,btohqsg
example like this TB  TOP in 2026  can sell the house only after 2041 (can apply next BTO upon MOP met in 2036) since new BTO takes 5 years to build,btohqsg
means in 20 years time lol,btohqsg
yeah if their combined income got average of $10k,btohqsg
sbf ah? even more chor  probably $30k more AT LEAST,btohqsg
the longer the 2nd appointment  the better since you have already chopped the unit,btohqsg
as long as the construction is going on even at a slower rate due to this Covid,btohqsg
wah sandflies.... reminds me of NS days..,btohqsg
yes as long as any location has hawker/shops/MRT within 300m radius   these 3 are enough for retirees,btohqsg
OK you have lesser than 3 months to think  the most you keep spending $10,btohqsg
urbanville is the one next to causeway point ah,btohqsg
that one best plot of woodlands liao,btohqsg
even the plot of woodlands this BTO pales in comparison,btohqsg
but got your desired unit? mine 420 applied for 300 units  that time not highly sought after despite its under mature estate,btohqsg
but which one do you prefer more? kovan is a no brainer unless your parents stay in tampines lar,btohqsg
but you not keen in macpherson BTO this launch lah?,btohqsg
Can someone share why I can't see the units for selection?,btohqsg
I think because details not out yet?,btohqsg
Supposed to have appointment in 2 weeks' time,btohqsg
But they showed me the one for Tengah,btohqsg
Initially I log in was for Jurong West,btohqsg
is it because it has been selected?,btohqsg
Good enough to have some views eh,btohqsg
sorry ah I don't quite get you  you mean you are from the earlier batch of tengah project? understood that you have an appointment in 2 weeks time,btohqsg
kovan is better than macpherson IMO,btohqsg
I am from the earlier batch of SBF....Not the recent one.Just got notified that my selection appointment is on 8 JuneFew days back when I logged in  I could still see the units available for selection in Jurong West for Jewel and Glades,btohqsg
But now can only see Tengah,btohqsg
Does that mean that I can only choose Tengah?,btohqsg
probably means the used to be available units at JW were selected I thinj,btohqsg
So that means no more for me,btohqsg
why not call up and ask,btohqsg
I think even so  should be able to see leh,btohqsg
I have emailedâ€¦the hotline super hot.,btohqsg
Right lor. I also dun understand why can't see,btohqsg
or you can make an appointment with your HDB branch,btohqsg
to clear your doubts  within the next 2 weeks before your appointment,btohqsg
I remember I was helping my mum to see the available units for her SBF  I even clicked those units that have been booked,btohqsg
Is it ok to take unit that is low level? Is there any disadvantage? Any advice?,btohqsg
