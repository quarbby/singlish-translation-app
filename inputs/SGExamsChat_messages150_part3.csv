You can also look to rent a space to study,btohqsg

@njeilsonsome people may not feel comfortable at home because of distractions and the environment,btohqsg
For example  some may not like to study in a cramped house,btohqsg
Or they do not like to study at home where there are construction sites,btohqsg
So there are pros and cons when you are studying in different locations,btohqsg
thats why ppl study at sbux and stuff,btohqsg
Id figure its better than a small study table,btohqsg
I study in the office when i was in NS,btohqsg
when u go somewhere with a specific goal youll be more likely to end up focusing on completing that goal,btohqsg
Do u see the apparent flaw in this logic,btohqsg
In my opinion  I like to study at home because I don't like studying in malls where there are noises by chattering. And I feel comfortable at home since I don't have to go out.,btohqsg
Its okay take ur time to figure it out,btohqsg
And what if I don't have a girlfriend? Hahaha,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't have a girlfriend. I have friends with no girlfriends.To me  I only progress to a girlfriend boyfriend stage if I wish to consider her for marriage. Otherwise it is pointless. I think to a girlfriend means you need to have a serious relationship with her and not just to play around.,btohqsg
Sorry I ugly no girlfriend ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Bf house can or not uh,btohqsg
If no girl wants me u think got boys want me ah,btohqsg
Someone likes being the sugar daddy i see,btohqsg
For me : yes only the hunky ones,btohqsg
Ive no balls to confess so nvm uhh,btohqsg
More of a reason to find a bf then,btohqsg
I did allow my bf to come to my house,btohqsg
And he said he got a best experience between me,btohqsg

Do it on the last day of school if you collecting your results,btohqsg
If it fails then you can run,btohqsg
The ppl in my school not rlly attractive to me,btohqsg
because another last day of school,btohqsg
That means it's fated that you drop out or date,btohqsg
your standards are for them to exist?,btohqsg
Attractiveness isnt just based on looks,btohqsg
More unwanted than the packet that everyone throws away,btohqsg
do you all eat those jellies at room temp or put inside fridge let cold then eat,btohqsg
Who got the willpower to put it in the fridge and wait,btohqsg
I hope someone steals it to make you pay for your mistakes,btohqsg
I put inside and only snack on it at night,btohqsg
I put it in my bag for like 1 week,btohqsg
okay but why you left inside for so long,btohqsg
cus i was p1 and i had more priorities like playing,btohqsg
cus i only saw it after a week when i was digging through my bag,btohqsg

I just empty my bag once a week to make sure my bag is clear of random stuff,btohqsg
