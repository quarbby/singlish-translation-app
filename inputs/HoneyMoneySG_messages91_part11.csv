Hi Mattheus  thank you for the concern. Yes  I do have emergency funds  saving funds etc. But I usually have coins lying around each week and I thought this will be a good opportunity to re-invest. Hence  I am looking for an ideal way to grow these coins that is often lying around at home.,btohqsg

It’s a high 5figure exchange so I wanted to know if there’s a safer alternative? Not in sg now so opening the cimb sg and myr account is not an option for me. 😞,btohqsg
Hi with the new cPf scheme  is it is better to quickly transfer money from OA to SA to hit the FRS early? Or it is better to slowly build the FRS with the $8000 top up to earn tax relief? What are the views?,btohqsg
Really depend on whether you can do without OA (for housing needs etc). If there isn't a real need  will be better to hit FRS early to compound.,btohqsg
"Happened to read this CNA article that mentioned where invested SA amounts will go  with the recent changes:""Another group of people affected would be those who invest their Special Account savings. After these accounts are closed  any proceeds will be paid to the Retirement Account  or Ordinary Account if the Full Retirement Sum has been reached.""Full article in the link below:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cpf-special-account-sa-shielding-closure-interest-rates-budget-2024-4131271",btohqsg
Do you know if  similar to linking Citi rewards with amaze  you can pair UOB preferred platinum to amaze to earn 4mpd on all transaction (since all amaze transactions are treated as online transactions  which is the earning category of UOB preferred platinum ) ?,btohqsg
Uob Preferred platinum is visa. Can’t link with Amaze. Only Mastercards can. And for Ppv you need to use mobile contactless to reduce the thinking. So I just add to apple wallet and use from there. Hope that helps,btohqsg
Oh you’re right  thanks a lot 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Snack investment  anyone know what is this?,btohqsg
Guys. I would to know if it's worth it to apply credit card in Malaysia to spend groceries there.,btohqsg

Thanks. 😊 This one is BOC sg bank account.,btohqsg
hi  what's the better way to pay for hsbc revolution credit card bill?,btohqsg
sorry not familiar with BOC  maybe you can try searching online first if you can close via internet banking,btohqsg
Have searched already via google before reaching out here  BOC only provided infor abt closure on BOC AU website. Thanks anyways,btohqsg
Just an update  have reached out to grab to clarify. There is a pre authorization hold on funds where grab charged to ur credit card an amount larger than the actual cab fare and they will reverse this hold of funds upon the confirmation of the ride. The above scenarios attached are not applicable to me which is strange. I have been using the same credit card for grab rides via their apps and never encountered such instances.,btohqsg
I am not sure about Malaysia's credit card but I had one from Maybank FC Barcelona visa signature card that gives small cash rebate and no annual fees. You can compare Malaysia and singapore ones with same card. I personally feel the credit cards in Singapore is better and way more competitive due to strong sgdEver since I knew I spend with Malaysia's credit card in Malaysia and didn't get reward well. It's better use those cash cards with good currency conversion rate (I.e. Trust card) or you use those singapores credit cards can earn better miles in overseas.,btohqsg
Sure Dave  thanks a lot for the info. So preferably to apply Maybank credit card. And obviously I can use it in Malaysia. But how's the FX rate? Do they incur that?,btohqsg
I think you misunderstood. I didn't say prefer to apply maybank credit card. You still need to research and compare. Also to each of its own and depending on your preference. For local credit cards there will be some hidden FX fees you will need to bear but I think due to strong sgd. I can bear with it. That's why many people are encouraging to use those cash cards  to name a few  trust card etc. And I think most credit cards issued in Singapore can be used in oversea as long as your setting made it can be used in overseas.Iirc  to apply credit card in Malaysia seems like you need to show your income statement in Malaysia (being employed in Malaysia). Not sure they will accept you who is a foreigner and employed in Singapore with less vested interest to apply credit card in Malaysia. You can enquire and look at their website for requirements and tnc etc. I got the credit card in Malaysia when I applied is when I am working in Malaysia before.,btohqsg
Sorry the moomoo 6.8% is only fresh fund right?Existing fund don't have?,btohqsg
Moomoo is dishonest and doesnt giev approperiate % e.g 5.8% but gave me 4.6%,btohqsg
All SG cards incur FX fee. You can go for Maybank Family and Friends: 8% cashback - 3.25% FCY fee on MYR transactions (capped at $25) or pair with Amaze and choose Grocery as one of your categories. Note that min $800 is required,btohqsg
A lot of people reported this 5.8% too.If 5.8% is not a real guarantee  I doubt 6.8% will be a guarantee too. You still interested in 6.8%?,btohqsg
Honestly right 4.6% is still better than core provides 4.5% but i dislike dishonesty. Ill take out 20k for core bah. The rest i think sua leave in moomoo for now. Even if i wanted 6.8% cannot cause i dont have any more fresh funds which is one of the requirements,btohqsg
Maybe put the rest in Us ETF bah moomoo feels like cheating gf idl sua bah.,btohqsg
Core 4.5% has less risk compare to 4.6%.If your fund return is 4.1%  you will get 4.1% instead of 5.8%.Core 4.5% return is guaranteed at 4.5% even if the company get return from market is only 3%.,btohqsg
Have to appeal to get the shortfall. They already lost my trust long ago 😔,btohqsg
Appeal also may not get it.,btohqsg
I appealed and got it. But you have to show them your calculations and alot of effort required. I wonder if they calculate manually or what,btohqsg
Mari invest better. No headache can withdraw immediately,btohqsg
Yup  I prefer Mari and Core more than moomoo's promos.,btohqsg
but how safe is mari to be honest? i only heard of that bank up till recently,btohqsg
