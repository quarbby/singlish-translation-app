Spark plugs Trans fluids last a long long time,btohqsg
if you are talking about SPA generation  definitely have... but i am currently driving chinese volvo and its still upholds its legacy,btohqsg
Many do grab because they‚Äôre bored. Who knows can meet passengers who can talk cars!,btohqsg
Same la. Chinese leave this to Swedish,btohqsg
Before this chinese was a belgian volvo  same like sweden and chinese also pretty solid,btohqsg
This is perhaps the only mass market brand i have not tried.,btohqsg
You will face fierce competition with ebikers. With raising fuel and drop in demand in takeaway food due to reopening  it may not be wise,btohqsg
E30 m3 done mostly by hand. Those were the days when robots are not heavily used yet.,btohqsg
Can check if car sharing app cars can go in jb?,btohqsg

I drive Kia .. I still prefer Toyota Camry  and I still like the lines of it although some jaguars are cool.,btohqsg
Should üò∑have extended the COE :(,btohqsg
Lane 1 supposed to be an overtaking lane and normal driving should be on 2nd lane and maintain at speed limit... I have several Incidents  the car in front of me just driving at 70km/h in KPE on lane one and without turning on the lights  cars in lane 2 were driving around 70+km/h  flashed the guy  but driver seem oblivious to this and just maintain the speed. Frustrated?,btohqsg
Me waiting for this as my car is in the final year  thought to just renewing COE,btohqsg
This is in place but nowadays traffic police don't summon people for this  about 10 years ago  driving along AYE near Clement  stopped by TP for going too slow on 2nd lane  was driving around 70km/h in the afternoon. No warning  just issue summon  kena $70.00 plus 4 points,btohqsg
Subaru‚Äôs VX and Tribeca are pretty problematic from friends who used to drive these model. Not much complaining from people who drives Forrester  except fuel consumption.,btohqsg
Forester is kinda powerful for it price   maybe that why the fc,btohqsg
Petrol expensive mah üòô some people want to drive slow thinking everyone also same. Especially hybrid taxis. I also realise they are aware they hogging. Because if u want to overtake them. U see their car lean into your lane  shows they are looking at the mirrors,btohqsg
These people sibei selfish hor. They never think the people behind might be rushing wife to hospital to give birth  rushing for meetings  parents fall down at home. At least be aware of people are faster behind and just move out and let people pass,btohqsg
ya drive so slow   same speed as middle lane  just move 1 side la  why so selfish and block ppl,btohqsg
it is os hard to over take  because the speed limit is too low  and the overtaking lane car is always travelling at the same speed as the middle lane,btohqsg
