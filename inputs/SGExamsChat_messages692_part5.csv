the new exam replacing o's and n's,btohqsg
been in the top tier and used to it,btohqsg
3 new contenders:4. any given palestine supporter5. futureofryan6. telehitch foursome,btohqsg
futureofryan is the underdog here with only a 7% equity,btohqsg
isnt f9 technically fail? 5 is still considered a pass in a na rite?,btohqsg
and the palestine supporter self immolates  hes out!!!,btohqsg
ok left 1  3  5  6,btohqsg
idk but for nt if u get U grade for ur na subj is automatically a U in nt,btohqsg
So the grading system is further optimized,btohqsg
grades 1-5 for na will minus 1 for conversion. e.g. 5-1 is 4 which equals to grade c,btohqsg
U shouldn't have a grade bah,btohqsg
smtg like tht. cant rly rmbr,btohqsg
My mum imposed this rule that the guy need to be caring to my autistic bro,btohqsg

So weird sia the new system,btohqsg
My NS life too boring so I came here to hear more drama and gossip lol,btohqsg
Then how to get 22 points even??,btohqsg
That’s like converting o levels to n levels right,btohqsg
im from clementi camp with gpa of 5 (gay people association),btohqsg
So G1 to G2 grades basically,btohqsg
B3 and A1 gives me the same thing,btohqsg
Who will study hard to get an A sia,btohqsg
but decrease min points for highes5 score,btohqsg
Can u go jc with that shit g2 scoring tho,btohqsg
I tot jc need minimum idk how many g3,btohqsg
But I think it’s like for G2 stream students taking G1 subjects under sbb,btohqsg
Wait G3 is express or is it G1,btohqsg
G1 is NT  G2 is NA,btohqsg
Wait sry then I mean G2 taking G3 under sbb,btohqsg
Then since G3 is harder that’s why the conversion is like that,btohqsg
I thought even right now it’s sth similar,btohqsg
My sis is in the sbb pilot school,btohqsg
A1 to B3 in o levels is like 1 point for n levels,btohqsg
The mix is so not it  like she told me her class got weird people and blah blah,btohqsg

Ohya broski how bad is inequality as a GP topic,btohqsg
Would U recco doing an inequality qn,btohqsg
I would write it because my competition consists of1. Emotional SJWs who believe that only minorities get discriminated2. People who only know what is happening in Singapore and USA,btohqsg
U cant really ask me like topic which one i would do cuz i legit can do any topic for gp,btohqsg
i go by how easy the qn is,btohqsg
I mean like for avg student,btohqsg
i mean inequality qns as long as u,btohqsg
