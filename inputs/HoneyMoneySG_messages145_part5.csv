hi all  im looking to submit the GIRO form to pay taxes in monthly instalments (EGA -> IRAS). i saw a video on youtube saying that IRAS will bear the cost of the postage. when you guys set this up  you simply head to singpost and write the address and thats it?also  the first repayment will be from apr 2025 through till mar 2026?^ oops. i got the answer for this — on the GIRO form it states that monthly GIRO deductions will begin once it is approved  and subsequently in May each year  to April of the following year.,btohqsg
For postage yes. There is a form for you to fill in. And just write iras on the envelope.Are you on monthly tax payment plan?,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony! Yup I got the form filled up. I selected monthly plan. Is there anything else that I need to do other than submitting the GIRO form?So again  just grab an envelope and write IRAS and mail it? I don’t think SingPost provides free envelopes right? 😂,btohqsg
Just do eGIRO. They recently accepted eGIRO from HSBC.,btohqsg
oh my! you're right! just to confirm  eGIRO/GIRO will still work for 1% cashback EGA? thanks Melvyn!,btohqsg
Mecure. Wanna book on accord website cause of membership,btohqsg
Any idea which card is best for mcc 5817 [digital goods - software application],btohqsg
Hi all  would like to ask for advice is there any CC that could earn miles for hotel bouquet spent within 5 months?Currently  I have applied UOB ladies which is limit $1000 a month for 4MPD. Would appreciate some advice  thank you.,btohqsg
If you can go down and paywave  UOB VS (capped at 2k for 4mpd) and UOB PPV (must do mobile contactless  capped at 1100 for 4mpd) would be good.,btohqsg
I do some in-app purchases on iOS and it is that MCC. I use Amaze CRMC for 4mpd. Apple charges have DCC and charges from Luxembourg so using Amaze really helps if you dislike seeing some weird charges thrown in.,btohqsg
Hi All  is Alipay payment considered online or mobile contactless  linking UOB PPV or visa signature can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
I search. Can earn mile using lady  WWMC  etc….,btohqsg
Hi all  will be embarking on renovation journey soon. Did some check but still unsure so seeking advice here and pardon for noob question.Would like to check1) which platform (card up or ipaymy) will be better?2) is it the best to pair uob priv (1.4mpd)?Is it worth to buy the miles?,btohqsg
The “is it worth it” is really up to you.I might find it worth it to pay for business class but not my friends.Can use both platform together especially with new to platform discount code or referral code.Check which one offers lower fees for you,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Thank you and noted to use both platform together for the new to platform discount!,btohqsg
Oh ya. Another question is since Reno payment milestone might be quite huge as well  is it need to increase credit limit?,btohqsg
No harm increasing? Imo it’s always good to have higher credit limits 🤭,btohqsg

can't find any to beat Eight $8 plan so far.,btohqsg
got free global data and free IDD calls?,btohqsg
yes. If i remember its10GB on Apac roaming.2GB for international roaming.,btohqsg
I have both StarSaver and FastSaver.My FastSaver is linked to NRIC paynow  so there has been some $ in from the government and insurance in recent months. So  afraid my FastSaver will not be eligible for the promohttps://www.cimb.com.sg/content/dam/cimbsg/personal/document/tnc/accounts/2024/casa-tnc-nov2024.pdfSo  I plan to use StarSaver for the promo and put in $75K next week until Feb 2025 for 3.2%. Is this a safe approach?,btohqsg
$7.90 is correct.but it doesn't have the extremely valuable free IDD calls.when overseas you can receive and call Singapore.,btohqsg
Eight is very cheap but line network is very terrible. I hv no line in tunnel  underground and wdls bus interchange and even sometimes in shopping mall! I switched back to Zym,btohqsg
Eight is using Starhub line loh.. actually not too bad based on my testing.Singtel > Starhub > M1 in my opinion.Although in recent months  due to shutdown of 3G network  all bets are off.. ALL ARE TERRIBLE NOW.,btohqsg
Eight is 4G. And sorry I tested and tried for 3 mths. It is terrible although using Starhub lines.,btohqsg
to give an example  at my work place  when i talk to bank using Singtel (yes the main singtel  not MVNO) it can cut off. I got fedup and called back the bank using my Eight phone.,btohqsg
Hello guru  is foodpanda subscription MCC 5499?,btohqsg
Perhaps my active zone and working area are bad for Starhub. It is very frustrated when wanna use grab  use favepay etc.,btohqsg
oh my. i just changed to eight =(,btohqsg
Really depends on ur area. I'm using vivifi based on Singtel but some areas also has inconsistent connection,btohqsg
my area so far i wouldnt say no issue. but minimal issue,btohqsg
i was using Giga before this. I would say is about the same for my area.,btohqsg
This is true  mobile network is highly dependent on your current location than the telco issue,btohqsg
