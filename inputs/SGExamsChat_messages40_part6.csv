Oh shame maybe the codec or smth is not compatible,btohqsg
Or you can consider getting your main rig to do the transcoding by setting up another plex media server on it,btohqsg
hmm TV still doesn't lag compared to my desktop,btohqsg
the dude was asking what we gnna do tmrw,btohqsg
Create a network share that you can map on your main rig to your server  then set up a plex media server on your main rig and add the relevant 4k files in haha,btohqsg
oh speaking of which  I got a SFTP server running off my i5-2320 too,btohqsg
I think that computer is severely underpowered,btohqsg
and is snapdragon 865 or kirin 990 5g or a13 better,btohqsg
sftp can't be mapped i think  just set up samba,btohqsg
I setup SFTP cause other ppl need access,btohqsg
actually a13 btr  but android best is sd865,btohqsg
It doesn't use that much resources  la haha,btohqsg
I think I'll just set it to stream at 1080p,btohqsg
since the TV has no issues at 4k and that's the only 4k screen I have  I'll just stream 1080p on everything else,btohqsg
I think that will also rekt your cpu,btohqsg
Because your input is basically 4k pixels and you have to convert it to 1080p,btohqsg
idk  I play interstellar at 4k with less than like 40% CPU usage,btohqsg
Ah ok so maybe I got the process wrong,btohqsg
U need 4k for what tho,btohqsg
@andrewomeAny knowledge regarding overclocking using Gigabyte motherboards?,btohqsg
but any other 4k video and it lags and stutters,btohqsg
I've never really did much OC-ing,btohqsg
Uhh are you on the chipset that allows overclocking,btohqsg
It's just that I can't seem to figure out the different voltage settings,btohqsg
Right well i never rlly did much overclocking so i think hitting the google would be better,btohqsg
I alr did and gave up,btohqsg
It's basically setting your clock as high as possible until unstable,btohqsg
Then slowly increasing voltage until stable,btohqsg
I couldn't even get 4.8GHz stable,btohqsg
Different mobo also different performance lul,btohqsg
Yes I know  but I can't figure out which voltages to increase,btohqsg
And sillicon lottery on the chip,btohqsg
I'm quite sure I'm doing something wrong,btohqsg
I don't think i can help you here,btohqsg
what happen when u increase this,btohqsg
I tot ai capabilities v good,btohqsg
In terms of everyday usage  you won't even feel much difference between the 3 processors,btohqsg
notverybad but just not as good,btohqsg
I mean isn't 4.8ghz really high,btohqsg
Unless idk what you use it for,btohqsg
But i'm not sure bout the chip either  gotta compare with what other ppl can get,btohqsg
A sizeable proportion can reach 5GHz,btohqsg
Maybe you just lost the sillicon lottery,btohqsg
maybe u just hit the unlucky silicon lottery,btohqsg
The moment I increase it anywhere past stock 4.5GHz weird stuff happens,btohqsg
Quite sure I'm doing something wrongly,btohqsg
Shrugs lol sorry i can't help here,btohqsg
even stock voltage can go up a little,btohqsg
my stock 2600 goes up to 3.85 without any voltage help,btohqsg
but then again it is an AMD,btohqsg
