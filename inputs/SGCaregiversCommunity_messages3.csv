I have clarified with Greg that it was not me who shared the the bank transfer screenshots on the post .  I merely responded to the article published by The Pride on the caregiver ‘s story and this has already been accepted by Greg . So perhaps there need to be more stringent checks on the community who wish to post information on the post so as not to creat misunderstanding with others in the group .,btohqsg

Hi all  our loved one (LO) (60) is a brain stem stroke survivor (SS) who is severely disabled/paralysed (hemiplegia on the left side). We do not qualify for any subsidies  thus our only option is private rehab.We are looking to hire an appropriate/suitable physiotherapist to help our LO.We have been trained by the hospitals to do basic PT OT ST rehab exercises  however we are ultimately not formally trained as therapists and we are just doing our best. Thus  we need someone to come in to help us formulate a long term rehab plan to go beyond maintenance rehab or merely countering deconditioning.Do we have anyone else with a similar condition here in this group? We would love to reach out to connect further. Please let me know if you have suitable contacts or recommendations for physiotherapists! Thank you so much!,btohqsg

Hi all  I received a cold call from someone who claims to be from HSBC today.She made a few claims about HSBC and Careshield Life that I would like to check with everyone to see if it’s true.For context  Careshield Life is a disability insurance coverage by CPF (replacing an older scheme called Eldershield) and we are auto-enrolled for it at age 30.1. She claims that HSBC is the main provider for the “Medisave subsidies under Careshield Life”.2. She claims that HSBC have additional schemes whereby we can use our “Medisave subsidies” to increase the payout that we get in the event of disability.3. She clarifies that this is not the same as “Careshield Life Supplements” (private insurers that offer this if you want to increase your payout)  which was what I initially thought she meant. I checked and realised that there are only 3 official private insurers for this supplement  namely Singlife  Income and Great Eastern.I have checked both CPF and HSBC websites but I do not see anything about HSBC being the main provider etc. Unlike CPF Dependent Protection Scheme where it states very clearly that it’s handled by Great Eastern  I can’t find anything about HSBC at all. What she is saying about HSBC having this extra scheme for higher payouts isn’t what I understand from these official sources either.I am wondering if this is a scam because if it is  I almost fell for it.Thank you.,btohqsg
Update:1. I called HSBC to clarify and they said there is no such thing and asked me to ignore and block the person.2. It may just be the case of an unethical insurance agent making very wild claims just to sell policies.Regardless  it’s very upsetting to encounter agents like these. Hope the official councils will do more to regulate agents/bad sales tactics.,btohqsg

Hi admin  thanks for the reply.I am a full time healthcare frontliner who is holding on to part time degree .I had been trying very hard to maintain the caregiver position since i was 18 ( 25 now) . I had recently decided to enrol the 2 elderlies ( 92 yr old with ckd  dementia  heart issue in day care pending initial assessment- not sure about the success as she kept changing her decision n mood towards it)   (67 yr old with long term childhood dystonia  recent multiple compression fractures  dementia - undergoing day 3 of day care) Being tapping on AIC payout but as he requires help daycare suggested medical escort approx $100 extra per month. Though it is within AIC payout the mum (92 ) is unhappy with it and threatens to withdraw him becos of cost. Both are not gait steady.Tried ICS which works - contract ended yesterday and unable to extend. Trial helper which she fired 2 within 6 mths .I am at lost. I need help with looking after them as well as to juggle with appointments as is just too many as i am a main caregiver for 4 of them .,btohqsg
I am drained becos both of them are completely opposite .. one does not want to eat ( cost concern though is affordable . Insisted to eat a piece of bread for 2 meals) while the other is constantly hungry,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing Li Hui. I’ll let the rest of the community to chip in accordingly.Meanwhile  let me PM you to see if my end we can help u to access to more help ok?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone have any idea where to get a wheelchair for elder but not too pricey?,btohqsg
You can also search onhttps://www.carousell.sg/. My suggestion is to look at prices for new ones so that you can compare if the second hand ones are worth paying.If your loved one has to be on the wheelchair all the time  then get one that's comfortable for sitting longer hours. My elder can still walk short distances so I got her a light and portable one as it's easy to transport in taxis. The smaller and lighter ones are not comfortable for sitting long hours.,btohqsg

Hi all  just found out about this dementia protection scheme that provides financialrelief in case the caregiver voluntarily ends his/her employment due to caregiving responsibilities  which is accurate in my case.the limit seems to be 65 years old unfortunately I can’t apply anymore  but it might not be too late for some of your care receipientshttps://dbs.chubbdigital.com/sg/dbs/pweb/dementiacaregiverprotect/,btohqsg
Is it true that ElderShield rejects new applications for disabled persons who didn’t suffer from disability before 2002? My dad has been rejected from both eldershield and idape. Please share alternatives for severe disability schemes,btohqsg
Heard homage gt no insurance covered for the workers if anytg happen to them,btohqsg
Plus we are one to one with client. Like.. for first time basis will b thrown in sea jus like tat,btohqsg
Homage sg has no insurance but homage Australia have insurance - no idea why,btohqsg
Yes. anyone parents from merdeka gen?,btohqsg
I suspect cos they have disability law. This mean if you have a condition  you still have the right to get insurance.,btohqsg
Yes  you're right.Pre-existing conditions are covered in insurance plans in Australia.I was studying there and working there and they have very comprehensive laws that protects people with health and disabilities,btohqsg
Really? I engaged with homage previously. They charged price increase to customer but unsure how much of the increase goes to worker. plus the workers get penalised for missing out client slots due to sickness. so I didn’t engage homage anymore,btohqsg
FYI. Can read more about Aus law. It apply to anyone with disability upon entry if you declared.Their level of human rights and quality of care is a lot more comprehensive than us. Yes they pay more tax but the health care quality is a lot better.,btohqsg
"Sometimes  you got to look at the financial market or the top. Do your investment analysis and theories. In SG  £ is top of mind rather than doing what is ""right for customer"".",btohqsg
The business structure can see from financial annual report. Then you can make an informed decision. After all  it is still a business like it or not.Health care and insurance is a big part of our GDP expenses. Someone got to feed the machine especially with rising business cost. This is more of the concept of commondification of health care. Or profit for health care for their shareholders.,btohqsg
Regardless  always make an informed decision. Diversify your resources. Don't just see the brochure. Do your own research for the best interest beside the cost factor. There must be some value that you are willing to pay for especially if services are similar.,btohqsg

Preloved items from another caregiver.If any of these will benefit you  do PM me. I will help to link up.,btohqsg
Interesting insights into how caregivers affect us developmentally across ages,btohqsg
Basically  we need to take a developmental approach to life la. At X stage e.g. middle age 40-60  there is a certain developmetal milestone then how u manage with competing goals. It is definitely doable if you have a strong ecosystem support. Problem comes when one try to tank and do everything alone,btohqsg
even for young children  there are some things that still can be done like small household chores. In some case  it build resiliency and empathy skills compared to folks who have no experience caring for others. But the baseline is caregiving is pretty much in the human nature and its social experienced. It as old as humanity as it was.. the only difference now is the structural and systemic issues like how work/school is separated from home life,btohqsg
Hi all  like to help a caregiver check if there is a pre-loved wheelchair that she can collect for her mother. If you have one or know of one  please do PM me. Thanks!,btohqsg

Does anyone have any tips on how to juggle time between these 5grps: old aged parents  aunties&uncles (1 whom suffered stroke; im the main caregiver for all)  young children  spouse and in laws  with a 9am-6pm office job (no maids) and all elderly living across sg (not tgther)? I'm starting to feel extremely burn out - living the life of a sandwich class in an ageing society,btohqsg
It would be good to have a village of people to support you. Very tough to do it alone. Might your spouse or relatives be able to help out? Have you considered a helper?,btohqsg
Yes  my spouse helped out. But I felt I neglected him as a result. All relatives are elderly who need help themselves. Had a helper for stroke care but sent her away after a few months because of some issues which gave me more headache than helping me,btohqsg
It’s not easy to juggle so many tasks. I’m proud of you for holding on for so long and reaching out to us. 😊I’m wondering if your aged parents  uncle  and aunts are known to any community partners. It might be helpful for them if they need assistance  which could take some of the load off you. You could consider approaching the medical social worker (if they have medical appointments at a government hospital) or the activity aging center in the neighbourhood or Agency for Integrated Care for advice.,btohqsg
Thank you for your advice❤️ only my aunt is known to aic a few years back due to stroke. Don't think she's in the file by now. Nope for the rest of the relatives  they're quite private ppl  and don't want to trouble others. But that's a good suggestion! I'll try to call in aic to see if any help is available,btohqsg
I get that elderly can be quite guarded against ppl who they don’t know but I think things will get better after they know the community partners long enough and rapport is built. They are prolly in a better position to refer the needful services too if they need help in future. But most importantly is to self care before you can care for others 😊 jiayous! 💪🏻,btohqsg
"It's hard when you're playing defense - there's more of them than there are of you. And with elderly  likely that the workload/needs will go up over time  gradually or suddenly due to events.For your parents at least  are you able to discuss with them the long-term plan such as downsizing to a place near you? They might not be keen to move out of their own area  but you have to be honest about your capacity to them as well. Always easier to move at a ""younger age"" so they have more time to adjust",btohqsg
Hi Pauline  I am a young caregiver of 2 who is looking after family members who requires special attentions such as being dementia and delusional disorder mixed dementia. I understand the struggle as I am both studying in the night while working full time in the day. My bf and I usually take turns towards the caregiving process but we ended up with conflicts too because of the folks.Can try to ask AIC for grants and helps ( quite significant) can ask them for help for meals on wheels ( subjected to means testing) it is not some atas meals but at same time balanced diet ( volunteers send the food up to their home and peak on them if they are staying alone or if you are not available to cook or pack food for them )   Can try to contact MET for appointments  COMIT if needed for caregiver related counselling ( FOC but need to make known to AIC first )If you need respite care or additional help can try homage/ Active GLobal .These are tips which helped me previously because my folks are highly guarded. I did manage to send one of them to daycare too and he is so happy these days. Hope this is helpful ya,btohqsg
Likewise   i do not have the whole village to support. Is definitely tough as I struggled very much over the years but I am happy to share with you these available help which i had learnt over the years.,btohqsg
Hi Pauline  It sounds like you're balancing a lot right now  and it's completely understandable to feel burned out.To help alleviate some of the load  I’d like to introduce two services that could provide some relief through AIC referral: Home Personal Care and Respite Services.Home Personal Care Services:This service provides caregivers who come directly to your home to assist with daily activities such as personal hygiene  feeding  medication reminders  and mobility support for elderly family members. Trained professionals handle these tasks  so you can have peace of mind knowing your loved ones are in good hands while you're at work. Home personal care can be tailored to your family's specific needs  offering flexible options that can accommodate both short-term and long-term care.Respite Services:If you're feeling overwhelmed  respite services can be a lifesaver. This service allows the primary caregiver to take a break while professionals step in to provide care. Whether it's a few hours or several days  this support ensures that your loved ones receive high-quality care while you recharge.Both services are provided by qualified healthcare professionals  ensuring that your loved ones are well taken care of. They can also be accessed through community service providers  and depending on your situation  you may be entitled to subsidies through AIC referrals based on means testing.These services are designed to lighten your load  giving you the time to focus on other responsibilities without compromising the care your family members need.Take care of yourself  Pauline – you're doing an incredible job.,btohqsg
You may also want to consider:Home Nursing Services:If your family members require more specialized medical care  Home Nursing Services provide professional nurses who can assist with wound care  injections  monitoring of vital signs  and managing chronic conditions like diabetes or post-stroke care or to apply for any financial assistance schemes or mobility finding that could off load your consumable burdens. This service is ideal for those who are bed bound  ensuring your loved ones receive high-quality medical care at home.Meals on Wheels:To help with nutrition and meal planning  Meals on Wheels delivers nutritious  well-balanced meals directly to your loved ones' homes. This service is especially helpful for elderly family members who may have difficulty preparing meals on their own  ensuring they receive proper nourishment without the need for you to be physically present.,btohqsg

Patient— shower at least once a day and use a gentle shampoo that does not sting the eyes  moisturize body with lotion  brush teeth twice a day  keep an eye for hair trimming and nail clipping (always trim nails straight across and not round like a semi circle to prevent breakage; trim after a shower when the nails are softer  if not  soak them in water for a few minutes and dry them first).Environment— change clothes and undergarments every day; if patient is on diaper  change diaper whenever necessary. Wash bedsheets once a week or more frequently if patient is bed bound and there are food crumbs  perspiration  hair strands on it.,btohqsg
Please have a look at this poster here  they offer help with personal hygiene,btohqsg
As best as possible  you should always as a caregiver encourage independence and routine in looking after their own personal care and hygiene. This can include printing out a clear routine of steps they need to take each day  as well as labeling their toiletries for them and keeping them in clear and accessible places where they know where to find them and reach for them easily.,btohqsg

We cannot stop death but we can ease and improve quality of life,btohqsg
Even we reach God frequency consciousness  we still have to face death.Thus in that regard  learning to self care through indingeous  traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine first aid is critical,btohqsg
doctors can do so much only and the medications can go far as they are double edged sword,btohqsg
And also volunteer at homes to leadn,btohqsg
we are firm believers of buddhism and have been listening to some monk talks help ease her,btohqsg

Main issue is SG mindset just blind faith  follow and obey like conformist milgram experiment in classical conditioning of psychology like blind sheep following blind shedp,btohqsg
Own issue must ownself ownself study and find out. And there simply no excuse especially because you have passed O level  Google  NLB and chatgpt,btohqsg
Understand that every industry is a simple capitalist model of making £££ at the expense of consumer including healthcare and social careThat just how the global financial system is set up. And that the 1.3 million people on medifund are drug dependent on simply because of ignorance,btohqsg
Answer is on all YouTube  NLB esp bu gis central librady  us ncbi and many other stuff. If ya can't think within 3 years  u definitely out of job because AI is here to stay and do your job,btohqsg
And SG govt know a lot of cure including cancer but only allow rich clientele to use stem cell treatment,btohqsg
So the ppl here r probably working class and simply left ignorant about the simple fact that you are God greatest creation and can learn to heal yourself,btohqsg
Right diet  right exercise  right values   right beliefs and rights social circle supportive and loving of u,btohqsg
In short. Sg is just a toxic traumatised bunch of adult children who refused to take action for self and keep blaming other's for problem aka tai chi  run away and blame.. so it become a question of karmic debt and fate,btohqsg

Are there any hospitals or places that accept donations of unused medication,btohqsg
hiLee GL In Singapore  donating unused medications is generally discouraged due to strict regulations and safety concerns. The Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore recommends returning unused medications to the pharmacies where they were prescribed for proper disposal.However  certain organizations accept donations of unused  unopened medical supplies and equipment for local redistribution.To minimise the environmental impact of wasted drugs and unintended drug exposure to children and animals  the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore recommends the following:1.Remove any personal information such as your name from the medicine package  container  or bag.2. Place the medication in a bag and secure it properly.3. Return the mediation to a nearby pharmacy.Alternatively  there are also caregivers that offers these unused medication supplies in our chat group here and some caregiver groups in fb etc and occasionally some caregivers will arrange privately to collect them if they are ok with it.,btohqsg
While we do not actively discourage such actions  we strongly recommend that all members exercise caution and undertake due diligence. Please be aware of the following:1.Safety Risks:Sharing or using medications that were not prescribed specifically for the intended user may result in adverse effects  interactions  or incorrect usage. Medications should ideally only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.2.Legal Implications: The exchange or redistribution of medications may be subject to legal and regulatory restrictions in Singapore. (i.e Controlled/Restricted Drugs) Participants should ensure compliance with relevant laws.3.Personal Responsibility:Any arrangements made between individuals are strictly private  and the group/organisation does not endorse  facilitate  or take responsibility for the outcome of such exchanges. Participants engage in these exchanges at their own risk.4.Medical Supplies: For unopened  non-prescription medical supplies  we recommend ensuring that items are sanitised (if appropriate)  unexpired  and in safe  usable condition before sharing.Note:If you are unsure about the safety or legality of any item  please consult a healthcare professional or relevant authority. For safe disposal of unused medications  we encourage returning them to local pharmacies where they can be handled appropriately.,btohqsg

Hello does anyone have a transfer board to borrow/for sale?,btohqsg
There are some selling on Carousell!But please do ask your doctor for advice before you proceed. Our doctor shared that a transfer board was only suitable if we had at least two people to do the patient transfer  and you have to be very careful or you risk accidents happening during the transfer process if you use it incorrectly.Because there is only one person looking after my mum  the physiotherapist taught me how to safely transfer her from bed to wheelchair  and from wheelchair to taxi  without a transfer board— just with my arms and body  and the right positions and postures. I also practiced with the physiotherapist helping my mum go into and out of the taxi at the Sengkang hospital car park.,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone know of good nursing home in Serangoon  Yishun area. Friend's mum 90 recently got stroke  currently stayed at TTSH-ICH. Thereafter need to transfer to Nursing Home or Home. But nowadays difficult to look for domestic helper  so alterative look for nursing home to stay.,btohqsg
"Hi@numberonedoraemonfan  finding a suitable nursing home for your friend's mum can be challenging. While determining whether a nursing home is ""good"" or not can be subjective (usually we have mixed reviews for all nursing homes from the conversations we hear from fellow caregivers) and may depend on individual needs and preferences  I suggest referring to the HealthHub Nursing Home Directory for a comprehensive list of options:https://eservices.healthhub.sg/healthhubng/public/services/directory/65.Some nursing homes in or near the Serangoon and Yishun areas include:- Bright Hill Evergreen Home (Serangoon area)- Peacehaven Nursing Home (near Upper Serangoon)- All Saints Home (Yishun)- Ren Ci @ Ang Mo Kio (close to Yishun)- St. Andrew’s Nursing Home (Buangkok)It’s best to explore these options based on your friend’s mum's specific care needs  such as post-stroke rehabilitation  long-term care  or dementia support. I recommend contacting the nursing homes directly to learn about their services  facilities  and availability  and  if possible  arranging a site visit to assess if it meets her requirements.",btohqsg

Hello all  seeking some advice about seeking financial assistance for bedridden 68 yo father.Due to being main caregiver at home for him  i have taken up lesser income & 2 other siblings income not stable lately.But refused to provide income statement / CPF document.Should I contact legal help?- Father is no longer mentally competent so yes I have court letter to represent my father he requires diapers medical supplies and milk feeding  physiotherapy,btohqsg
Hi@hellocosybakessorry to hear about your challenges  it’s not uncommon for some families that had the same challenges you had.Since you already have aCourt Orderto represent your father  you have the legal authority to act in his best interests. However  if your siblings’ refusal to provide their income documents is hindering your ability to apply for subsidies  consider the following:Mediation Services:• TheCommunity Mediation Centre (CMC)can help facilitate discussions between you and your siblings to address the matter amicably.Legal Assistance:• If mediation does not work  you may seek legal advice to explore options to enforce financial contribution from siblings under theMaintenance of Parents Act. You can contact theLegal Aid Bureaufor affordable legal help or reach out to theFamily Justice Courts.Check with AIC or your designated social worker to see if they can provide you further advices Joe to go about it. Take care.,btohqsg
Oh I see thank you so much for your advice and tips. I will seek help accordingly. Very helpful to know about maintenance of parents act I did not realise that,btohqsg

Most welcome! Hope is helpful for u!,btohqsg
Hi  where to find those freelance/part time caregivers that we can engage directly?Thanks!,btohqsg
These providers are able to provide as well,btohqsg
I checked a few and it’s pre schedule based on hourly rate.,btohqsg
yes it's mostly in such model. Are you implying that you want to find caregivers that can be activated to come anytime you prefer and not charged by hourly?,btohqsg
Yes. Cos my father condition is unpredictable.,btohqsg
i see. i hear you  but unfortunately there isn't such service that are made available at this moment. Long time ago there were companies that attempted it but it wasn't sustainable and the cost became too high (due to the company still have to pay for their staff on standby with or without customer) for most caregivers to be willing to pay for it.We are aware that most people either went for full time domestic helper as an option  or made arrangement within their household members to take turn on standby for unforseen circumstances. Alternatively  some ended up choosing nursing home as the way out due to financial constraint or interpersonal issues with domestic helpers.,btohqsg
Thanks.. we have a helper but it is exhausting sometimes.,btohqsg
another alternative is u can ask the hospital medical social worker to help refer u to ICS ( interim caregiver) .. I did that previously for mine,btohqsg
I understand.. you may consider to engage hourly rated caregivers on periodic basis to give your family and domestic helper a structured resting period every 1-2 weeks  depending on your financial capability to determine how regular you can afford to. This might provide you and your family members a more sustainable approach in resource and capacity planning for your own wellbeing.,btohqsg
I contacted Homage.. using the apps to book their service  maybe takes 1 to 2 hrs for response if I have urgent requests.,btohqsg
For jaga me  need to give many days notice.,btohqsg

Ah...I hope my dad will keep it on,btohqsg
Thank you  I did contact them and they called me back just  however at this point they think I should also look into asking SKCH to keep him warded until I can ready my place since I'm not ready yet,btohqsg
Are you able to attach an Apple AirTag to the belt loop of his pants / shorts?,btohqsg
be firm that you will need help until you managed to get the right setup to support your dad  let them know that safety and wellbeing is at risk so that they can offer advices and resources to you better.,btohqsg
im making use of OMG solutions watch for my grandma back then... Fall detector allowed and u can video call them just need to click on green button to ans .. very easy to use..Mine likes to remove too. the min she remove we got alerted.. was using it till she got a helper,btohqsg
it was okay .. not very price too.. I think i paid less than $200 for it .. just need get sim card,btohqsg
even if he runs out the gps u can trace and find where he mia too,btohqsg
https://shop.tackgps.app/For the tracking one  can consider this one  that can go anywhere. Their price is low and their accuracy is very good.,btohqsg
Haiz. I talk to MSW about my situation and eventually still bounce me to AIC. Call up AIC they also said that it's the financial grants they can help me with  but I have to persuade the Dr and PT....talk to Dr and PT both assure me dad's stable ....even after knowing he pushed me and refused my help to walk alongside him  not even going into personal care yet (nurse can't even sign off on teaching me how to change his diaper cos he rejected me),btohqsg
I'm going to try and push harder on Monday when I meet the PT to finalize the equipment dad requires  but I feel a little overwhelmed now.Many thanks to Greg for helping me with the hospital bed  I alr put the deposit for the delivery  at least for now my dad has a bed to sleep in  so I'm trying to pace it out so I feel I can breathe a little easier.,btohqsg
from what we understand  they cannot allow discharge unless caregiver is confident in managing and able to perform all the required support to the patient.. PT can support your concerns to the doctor  try to articulate your problems to the PT and Dr again. Good luck,btohqsg
Better to get a caregiver (not helper) and share room with your father.,btohqsg
Hey Cindy  not sure if this might help  but there’s a NUHS caregivers day event going on at Ng Teng Fong general hospital this Saturday  and caring for patients with dementia is a topic that they’re covering,btohqsg

Ah thanks. I'll be busy shifting furniture and getting my place ready this weekend  hope it can be useful for others...,btohqsg
If your father has his own room   the caregiver can sleep on floor mattress. I dun know how small is small but definitely need rearrangements . Caregiver will help to lighten your load and you can have more time to care for your son .,btohqsg
Moreover the bedroom is currently occupied by a tenant  I kept telling the Dr and PT and MSW she will only move out mar 8  but they keep telling me discharge is next wed...,btohqsg
Icic. Ok I'll try to figure that option out. Currently still have to put my dad in the living room until the tenant moves out,btohqsg
Talk to geriatric doctor and MSW . They can help you more than the rest.,btohqsg
Ok thank you so much. I will.,btohqsg
All the best . Dun give up 👍💪,btohqsg

Is there a support group?I have been talking to different groups of friends daily but I think I don’t want to keep reaching out cos everyone is also busy.,btohqsg
I know AIC got some helplines for that..,btohqsg
Exercise and take up more healthy activities,btohqsg
It is not easy to get over grief. I'm have been through. It takes a long time. I still have to move on.,btohqsg
Don’t be too hard on yourself about getting over it. Instead  try sitting with your grief  understanding it  and eventually learning to carry it differently. It’s completely okay to feel sad—your father was important to you  especially if this happened recently.Sitting with grief is part of the healing process  but it’s important not to stay stuck in it. Seeking help is a step forward. Here are some support providers you can reach out to:Viriya Comm ServicesO Joy Care ServicesSAGE CounsellingEveryone grieves differently.

Hi just asking around if anyone has any recommendations to get sacrum dressings at a cheaper price? Like the one in the pic.Asking as I just spent quite a lot at cgh pharmacy for the allevyn life sacrum (close to $20/ piece.) my mom insists she needs two pieces a day for my 97y.o. grandmother who's bedbound.,btohqsg
Hi@pursedinoi see some options on Shopee and its about $10/pcs. In taobao (china e-commerce) sells about $7 per pcs excluding shipping. Malaysia website shows that its about SGD $10 approx as well  potentially can get bulk pricing which lowers it a little  but shipping will increase as well for bulk.,btohqsg
There are advanced sacrum dressings (e.g.  foam dressings with silicone borders) offer extended wear (up to 5–7 days) if the wound condition allows. If the wound is not heavily exuding  hydrocolloid dressings can provide longer wear time compared to foam-based alternatives - so that you don't have to change it too often. Some seniors may be using two pieces due to inadequate coverage. Using a larger  appropriately shaped or custom shaped dressing (e.g.  sacral-shaped foam) might reduce the need for multiple dressings.You may want to consult the doctor for advice (on your mom's observation that 2 pcs is needed for your grandma  it could mean a reassessment might be needed).,btohqsg

Hello  anyone who has their parents in Transitional Care Facility (TCF @ west - pancare medical)... Any idea what's the fees like? Pioneer gen got further subsidy or discount? Can PM me,btohqsg
hi Audrey  TCF typically costs between $75~150 as a day rate (depending on the residency status of the individual).Regarding financial assistance  patients may utilise MediSave and MediShield Life to offset eligible expenses:- MediShield Life: Coverage is subject to approval  with a claim limit of $350 per day.- MediSave: Withdrawals are capped at $250 per day  up to a maximum of $5 000 per calendar year.Family members can also use their MediSave to pay for approved dependents.For Pioneer Generation members  the government provides additional support through the Pioneer Generation Package. This includes special subsidies of 40–60% for MediShield Life premiums  depending on age  and annual MediSave top-ups ranging from $250 to $900.For precise information on how these subsidies apply to services at TCF @ West  it's advisable to contact PanCare Medical directly or consult with a medical social worker.,btohqsg
Need to be mindful that TCF only provides short-term stays while the family works on a long-term care plan. A prolonged stay at any healthcare facility  including TCF  may result in overstayer charges if the patient is assessed to be medically stable and has feasible discharge options.I agree to speak with the medical social worker there to learn more about the fees and discuss the care plan if needed.,btohqsg
