So lets wait and see  so those people can zip their mouth,btohqsg
no wonder glove stocks are been whacked down  later glove companies will send emails  expressing their disappointment,btohqsg
I believe the reason could be because our cases not as much. Comparing to other countries. Any tom dick or harry could be infected. So wear gloves  full ppe is a must.,btohqsg
Is like how LHL at first say we no need wear mask. End up become mandatory to wear.,btohqsg

many import/export are  greatly affected by the super crazy increase of the rates/charges and shortage of the containers ... this has already been happening since a few weeks ago... so far no sign of improvement ... rates/charges are increasing..,btohqsg
this is very real and we are experiencing it right from the beginning...🤦,btohqsg
But this is good for shipping companies only right n not to ports? I heard unlike before shipping companies cut the number of ships for goods shipment hence higher rates. No?,btohqsg
probably one of the factors is caused by the crazy demand for the shipment of gloves and PPE ...,btohqsg
Although we do know China ports activities good lah,btohqsg
no.. the port and handling  charges and activities  are all increased proportionately too...,btohqsg
china ports activity surge  china cosco fly,btohqsg
ships are leaving US ports with empty containers just to save time rush back to china,btohqsg
which is quite unheard of. 1 way wasted trip,btohqsg
i think trump must be fumingif anythingit feels trade deficit is surging,btohqsg
Furion gor gor... I looking at samu,btohqsg
Sometime le.. since 23 then volume low... I jeep abit 25/255,btohqsg
of course talk easy now la lol,btohqsg
but if u buying into the story  illiquidity is a boon rather than a bane,btohqsg
because simply attention can send it flying,btohqsg
price discovery is the most fruitful,btohqsg
Cosco that day booms! Then brought more attention to samu also,btohqsg
that is why US-China trade deficit so high... Cina only wants to export and dun want to import  if possible...🤦😂,btohqsg
volume too low  bb on holiday mode !!,btohqsg
There was chance to get this one 0.009.Hope some did. Buy 9 if sell 10 also win 11%,btohqsg
actually it is not that china got nothing to import. is the ship not willing to wait because they want to rush back to china to load (rather go empty) and waste the fuel and 1 trip $$$ because more than compensated for the china to US tripso usually is demand triggered (who are willing to pay the shipping premium). unlikely the sellers are willing to absorb such high chargesa beneficiary of fed print and gov angbao?,btohqsg
specially for u. target around 29-30 cent can see a R,btohqsg
If the ship export China made goods to US  why ship don’t pick up the goods made in US back to China forfeiting the income?,btohqsg
I see.. anyway  going forward all of us need to be prepared for further increase in the import goods liao.. which should be already happening now...🤦,btohqsg
Ooohh... demand triggered... xie xie for sharing.,btohqsg
Aaaww... 🥰 xie xie... me also thinking 29,btohqsg
Yinda look like inverted h&s.. hope for a breakout in time to come,btohqsg
commercial reason. empty and rush back to china can only meanthe loss from forgoing the trip from US to chinais more than made up from the extra profits made from china to US,btohqsg
very much agree on thatasia routes all price surging,btohqsg
