eh my sch made us all do gp style since y3,btohqsg
even in y2 teacher say cannot write personal recount alr,btohqsg
jesus the fact that this is unironic,btohqsg
then from y3 onwards is all argumentative,btohqsg
fuck all those other essay types,btohqsg
i mean tbf ip and my sch dont offer KI anymore so everyone have to do gp in the future,btohqsg
i think my sch offered KI when i was in y1 but then no one want to take,btohqsg
I suck at personal recount  i do btr in arg type,btohqsg
ngl i feel like personal recount is good for primary school but afterwards is not very useful alr,btohqsg
Bro idg whats the point of teaching personal recount in pri school,btohqsg
unless u become a storybook writer in the future,btohqsg
cause like your employer isnt gonna ask you to write about a traumatic experience,btohqsg
personal recount is the least metacognitive set of writing tools u will ever employ as a person,btohqsg
if u literally cant describe ur life experiences,btohqsg
idk what ur doing in life man,btohqsg
Why u so boring that u have no personal interests or experiences beyond studying,btohqsg
narrative writing is a highly niche field of writing and then like tbh 90% of singaporeans wont be using it in their working life,btohqsg
maybe yea those who write fiction or storybooks will benefit lah but vast majority just copy and paste,btohqsg
But situational writing is fun tho,btohqsg
ok tbf i liked personal recount writing cause i wanted to become an author when i was younger (still kinda want but ik its gonna be a side hustle and not a main job),btohqsg
but for ppl who legit lack interest in writing they will just memorise model essay,btohqsg
jeez wait is she yr age,btohqsg
i keep thinking ian just finishrd alvl,btohqsg
oh jesus fuck dear god bless,btohqsg
Actually i use to memo essays in pri sch‚Ä¶,btohqsg
my perception of time is warped,btohqsg
i cant believe kids born in 2017 are p1 this year,btohqsg
But then in jc i had no time for it lol and how to memorise argumentative essaysüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
This reminds me of my h3,btohqsg
There was once my cher used my essay as a model essay for the class without realising i actually memorised an essay fr my tuition lesson,btohqsg
Is there anything i can do to get myself out of feeling perpetually tired,btohqsg
maybe i shld make my kids memorise my essays,btohqsg
I attended an introductory course on Mindfulness conducted Brahm Centre and I found it helpful,btohqsg
the top in cohort for GP when i was J1 memorised her whole essay from KS Bull and vomitted it,btohqsg
even though the question wasnt even the same,btohqsg
not sure if my model conclusion is too advanced for a sec 4,btohqsg
ever since that paper idt she ever got more than a D,btohqsg
cb my kids sch model essyas,btohqsg
look like what i wrote in sec 1,btohqsg
itd not advanced for a sec4,btohqsg
its what i wld write for a gp essay lor,btohqsg
my english teacher in sec4 has beef with the boy i like,btohqsg
Ur english is not complex enough,btohqsg
Then we can see 4 ourselves,btohqsg
the bar for n level english is just no grammar erros no vocab errors,btohqsg
‚Äúhence i agree with this point  technology interferes with social life.‚Äù,btohqsg
but if it was a gp essay,btohqsg
whats the format for conclusion again,btohqsg
I mean if u rly want to teach GP private tuition  you could retake GP only just to get an A,btohqsg
its been too long for me,btohqsg
