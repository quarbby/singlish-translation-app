Hi can I check which card is better to use for raffles medical bills?- amaze + Citi rewards- Citi premiers- SC SMART card- Trust Card,btohqsg

You referrimg to the moomoo promo for 1.8% yield coupon?,btohqsg
is it because ur trying to withdraw SGD? Your $$ should be USD after selling ur TSLA stocks,btohqsg
yeah  i tried converting from USD to SGD first but got nothing to convert.,btohqsg
If yes. Go under coupon. It will show you when it expire.,btohqsg
To be sure  which citi bank card are you referring to? Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Hello  no I'm not referring to any moomoo promotion or coupon.Essentially I sold some$TSLAstocks yesterday. The order was fully filled and the monies (USD) are reflected in my assets/account. However  as I wish to withdraw the amount  I tried converting the USD to SGD using the conversion tool but there's nothing to convert.Is this like a cool down thing? Like I cannot convert USD to SGD over the weekend or sth?,btohqsg

360 usually lags behind uob one,btohqsg
There's a cooldown of about 2 trading days based on experience  not immediate,btohqsg
