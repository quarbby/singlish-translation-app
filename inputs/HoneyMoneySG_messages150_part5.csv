thanks for the warning... surprised that linked card will also kennathere is a small chance for wallet TOPUPs to attract cash advance fee but never heard before linked card spending also can kenna,btohqsg
maybe it affect cimb sg cards only. for now i earn changi pay to earn points and pay using physical card,btohqsg
Hi which card is the best to link with alipay/WeChat?,btohqsg
Alternatively  TRUST cashback if you are not into miles,btohqsg
Anyone experienced Shopee not being coded as 5699 for UOB Lady fashion category before? Did I do something wrong in the checkout process?,btohqsg
Shopee is not fashion category. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong,btohqsg
What did you purchase? They asked u.,btohqsg
How will the item affect the MCC? Because you can have many items in same transaction right?,btohqsg
For Shopee  best to use OCBC rewards or UOB PPV,btohqsg
So lazada  taobao etc are 5311 fashion but shopee is not? Did I understand this correctly,btohqsg
Shopee was never 5311 to start with,btohqsg
You can use OCBC rewards. They whitelist Shopee so can earn the bonus miles,btohqsg
Even lazada can give varied mcc,btohqsg
Sometimes Shopee will code the transaction differently based on what you bought. Some got 5699  some got 5331  some got others also. Never wise to use strict whitelist based card on such merchants.,btohqsg
Shopee my favourite is dbs wwmc  ocbc reward  citi reward  uob ppv for miles and uob one for cashback,btohqsg
Recently i encountered a Taobao MCC 5399.,btohqsg
May i know anyone use ocbc frank card and pay bill via ipaymy  is it considered legitimate transaction to earn cash back?,btohqsg
ok so UOB lady is not safe to use for fashion. Which category is recommended?,btohqsg
UOB lady's is safe for Fashion  but not safe for Taobao. Just use a card that offers bonus for online would be safer.,btohqsg
Can check card t&c to see if it's in exclusion.,btohqsg
okay  so only safe for platforms that only sell clothes?,btohqsg
not safe for general online shopping platforms?,btohqsg
It is not exclusion but ipaymy customer service also cannot confirm and ask me use mile card because of point guarantee,btohqsg
shopee.. best is UOB One 10% cashback...,btohqsg
Alipay is setup for China residents to pay in Singapore,btohqsg
You can try.. usually safe if t&c does not state excluded.,btohqsg
So what did u buy? üò¨,btohqsg
Hi all gurus   is buying ntuc voucher online (ntuc app) eligible for citi bank smrt 5% rebate ?,btohqsg
You need to understand how they give the bonus. UOB lady‚Äôs is by mcc. Unless you are sure of mcc  if not  use blacklist cards,btohqsg
Sorry what's the benefits of using changipay? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi ChrisI have been a silent supporter for YouTube,btohqsg
If I transfer $ from my OA to my partner SA account to allow her to hit FRS faster,btohqsg
UOB krisflyer also can right? Especially the BNPL (pay later) MCC 5999,btohqsg
1) will both of us have supercharged interest?,btohqsg
If both of y'all have hit FRS on SA and BHS on MA  your interest and contributions to MA will go to OA.,btohqsg
Hi hi  any idea on investment options with optimal return and low risk please? Thanks üôè,btohqsg
There is no such thing as low risk investment. Even those recommended by insurance FA can lose capital value,btohqsg
actually it is exactly those that insurance agents recommend can lose capital value...they typically get fat commissions on those funds with higher management fees which are typically the higher risk ones,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea for boc family card  does deliveroo clock as online or dining? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Guys question on cpf investmentWith 100K in my OA   i can invest 80K max on a single premium ILP right ?,btohqsg
Ok for UOB KF but why 3mpd when you can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all  using UOB ONE credit card on klook transactions eligible for the min $500 spend for the cc cashback? I checked heymax website it is one of the recommended cards but i just want to double confirm. Thanks,btohqsg
True  probably I need to go and see if the two cards can accept 5999 ü§î,btohqsg
UOB is quite strict about buy now pay later service so I wouldn't risk it.,btohqsg
I've never had shopee coded as 5699. Usually  5262 for Visa  5331 for Mastercard,btohqsg
why would you do that? ilp is so bad,btohqsg
It has zero sales charge if its from cpf and management fee only at 1.6% mah,btohqsg
better than leaving it in cpf earn 2.5%,btohqsg
Is the ILP capital protected? I don‚Äôt think so. Why don‚Äôt you learn to manage yourself instead letting others do it?,btohqsg
I've only seen endowment plans that are capital protected  ilp likely not,btohqsg
