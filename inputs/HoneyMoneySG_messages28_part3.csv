Can try Amex cards like Highflyer  TCB  UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Currently cny now HSBC offers the shorts time with highest interests rates?,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. I only have the Amex krisflyer blue.,btohqsg
I applied for the HSBC a week ago üò≠üò≠ haven‚Äôt reach me,btohqsg
Anyone knows? Im thinking of moving most of my lines over to circles if get 10x and if not getting 10x then not worth the switch.,btohqsg
Not sure. But if you are moving to circles  you can use $13 cashback on shopback for circles sign up,btohqsg
Can check w UOB via chat assist,btohqsg
I currently on circle  going to cancel it  need to wait 2 months to cancel  lots of hidden promotions  no clear faq about promotions  5G unstable  4G network slow,btohqsg
Although they on m1  m1 has a better 5G n 4G network,btohqsg
If u ok with it's then u stayed on LoR,btohqsg
Ye m1 still worst but circle life is shittier than m1 own self n the promotions they have is always misleading new customers,btohqsg
Currently on starhub and have about 6 lines cause all my family park under my name with broadband,btohqsg
Looking for good and cost effective plans,btohqsg
Gg to cancel but they have a policy to stay with them for 2 months before can cancel,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt take plan with contract  take sim only  more cost savings,btohqsg
Yea. Im deciding on that then i see circles family plan. Looks promising promo,btohqsg
Do a calculation and u still save when u sign sim only and purchase a phone at retail price,btohqsg
Their customer service is another shit thing,btohqsg
But better than SingTel customer service,btohqsg
Thanks for the feedback. Shall rethink again.,btohqsg
No problem  I got scam by circle life promotions without any faq on the promotion,btohqsg
Whenever there is promotion telco will have a page abt the promotion faq but for circle they don‚Äôt have any  they only have general faq which does not cover their promotion. Example: they always like to give ‚Äúunlimited data‚Äù as their promotion  but when u sign up it is not even unlimited data  they only give u 80GB of data with data roll over,btohqsg
My latest experience with Singtel cS is pretty good üëç,btohqsg
Shop is still ok friendly  but call is terrible especially outsource call  is from sg than still ok,btohqsg
Yes  I‚Äôm on call  had issue with login to their portal,btohqsg
Hi I just joined. Happy Chinese new year to all! üßß,btohqsg
Is instarem amaze stacked with city credit card better then hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
I prefer hsbc revo as it‚Äôs only 1 party instead of 2  unless not under the whitelist,btohqsg
Anyone has referral link for instarem amaze? I would like to apply now,btohqsg
Hi any idea how can i pay my insurance now with uob aboslute?,btohqsg
revo is better since no round down,btohqsg
Use the referral links from my affiliate group att.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi  anyone used DBS Live fresh student card to pay for spotify? Saw its 5% but iirc  spotify is processed overseas so have dcc? Anyone got insights? Thanks!,btohqsg
Most likely have DCC lor. Cancelled that some time back,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh card has 3.2% DCC.,btohqsg
Sigh no avoiding DCC. When I was a student I only hoped to get an Amex card soonish to avoid DCCs.,btohqsg
Assuming you spend $9.90/month  that means you'll be charged $10.22 ever month including DCC. After cashback is credited you'll have spent $9.725 in total,btohqsg
which is still the highest effective cashback among student credit cards  even better than SC Jumpstart + Amaze,btohqsg
Yep just enjoy the live fresh student card while you can. Remember to cancel one year before graduation though  and temporarily use a debit card like Singtel-Dash Visa card (digital only),btohqsg
also doesn't singtel dash visa not give any rewards?,btohqsg
Benefit from New To Bank offers,btohqsg
Just an example ma.1. It is one of the few prepaid cards you can use to link to Apple Pay and make the most out of Kris+. google pay also supported. GrabPay MC is another  equivalent card for Android phones  I suppose.2. It does give rewards if you Heng Heng scan Dash all the time in Sheng Siong  FairPrice and Cheers.3. You might be invited to GXS faster on Dash than on Grab given the lowish take up rate on Dash. GXS seems perfect for students.4. I am not very sure whether Revolut still issues MasterCard as they issue Visas again. If that‚Äôs the case then there is no use case for Amaze haha,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your points. I think SC Jumpstart is also a good card to have for students  same cashback as Maybank evibes,btohqsg
HSBC EGA 5 eligable transaction can i like transfer any amount out of the account 5 times ?,btohqsg
Just to check through online banking able to place fixed deposit with such offered rate? Or need to go down to the branch,btohqsg
For hsbc ega  must I deposit the first $5k this month or next month is fine?,btohqsg
Creating acc online also need 5 business days. Go down direct easier and faster,btohqsg
Regarding HSBC EGA promo  for $5000 deposit  is it a total deposit per month or must it be done in one transaction?,btohqsg
I think the month it got approved,btohqsg
Does anyone know where can i applyUOB12NEWduring shopee checkout with uob CC?,btohqsg
