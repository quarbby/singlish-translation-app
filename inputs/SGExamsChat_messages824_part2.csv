Does anyone hv experience w wisdom tooth extraction,btohqsg
I did mine while in NS,btohqsg
Idk if i shld heed my dentistâ€™s advice to get the impacted one out coz â€˜it will eventually cause problemsâ€™ but my mum thinks the view is biased,btohqsg
If its impacted you better get it out,btohqsg
But im aware if i go and take x-ray  only valid for 6 months,btohqsg
impacted wisdom teeth should be removed,btohqsg
Tbh it is just an older generation mindset thingâ€¦coz last time the services are not so established,btohqsg
and thatâ€™s why a lot of older people have messed up teeth,btohqsg
But do companies actually cover wisdom tooth extraction,btohqsg
I will probably extract when im working (so that er can claim medisave)ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Depends on the dental coverage of the company's plan,btohqsg
But if it's a decently massive MNC it's likely health will extend to actually cover that. But u also have a separate issue of it being a preexisting condition before the plan itself,btohqsg
So it can be denied coverage based on that.,btohqsg
?? Medisave is a personal thing that is still effective even now w/o a job it's just u cannot actually claim anything because there's no money in that account.,btohqsg
I extract my wisdom tooth sponsored by the SAF,btohqsg
That one is diff. SAF coverage extends to all procedures at Government structured hospitals,btohqsg
Either way its free MC as well,btohqsg
I think the main question is not rlly exist more of the private or government health service track that one elects. If its a MNC with great coverage for health most likely it will cover and diminish the need for co-pay assuming it hits the out of pocket limit which private dental usually will.,btohqsg
It's a very common method. Either extraction of a teethor the tip of your penis,btohqsg
Public or government health service track that elects?,btohqsg
Ah I think I get what you are talking about,btohqsg
