Anw I just sleep more and go sch as usual,btohqsg
No seat then ofc sit on floor,btohqsg
im that type of guy who stands on the train for more than an hour even though there are seats avaliable,btohqsg
You're telling me u paid just to stand,btohqsg
huh it was free during the morning,btohqsg
that's the point where I'd put headphones on,btohqsg
I was so tired that I didn't even realize I drooled,btohqsg
my worst public transport was falling asleep on some lady's shoulder,btohqsg
it's time to show him some of that,btohqsg
kuro u get fucked because u ain't scary enouh,btohqsg
nah my go to is just ignore,btohqsg
they get more pissed if you ignore,btohqsg
i wldnt have done shit like this,btohqsg
unrelated but np open house is great,btohqsg
he's the reason that unless i that day damn good mood,btohqsg
i don't give up my seat,btohqsg
you don't have to give up your seat if you are not seating in the first place,btohqsg
so either way you take the L,btohqsg
i'm a petty mf if i wanna be,btohqsg
For me it's just some NS guy's head kept landing on my shoulder,btohqsg
if the guy take slipper slap me,btohqsg
And missing my stop and some stranger wake me up,btohqsg
as a dhs kid i accept siyan as my senpai because he uses his brain before he talks,btohqsg
Supposed to stop at tamp but landed in pasir ris,btohqsg

Went out down the staircase abit alr then went back up,btohqsg

had to get up to shake him awake then go back...,btohqsg
nah i left the server lol,btohqsg
If that's me   I would end up body slamming myself,btohqsg
i genuinely hate teaching gp why did someone deadass write in their essay,btohqsg
"""Women in Singapore love providing for their family.""",btohqsg
as a reason for why they are valued,btohqsg
are women valued in your society,btohqsg
feel like i'll always recommend avoiding gender related questions,btohqsg
really easy to go out of point or make some bad statements,btohqsg
I think if u wanna do gender or these weird ass equality qns u need to make sure u don't sound stereotypical,btohqsg
I've seen someone say before that the elderly have no value in society because they cannot use technology,btohqsg
And u actually know what ur writing abt,btohqsg
And you don't sound overly emotional,btohqsg
I have a friend who writes overly emotional essays when it's a topic on race,btohqsg
Because HE is Indian smth smth minority race in singapore smth smth constant racism,btohqsg
This is the guy who told me that I was racist for speaking to my friends WHO COULD NOT SPEAK ENGLISH in Chinese when he was near me (not even part of the convo btw),btohqsg
passion can easily cloud a logical argument,btohqsg
ok i won’t call him a friend,btohqsg
"My friend sent a Chinese joke in the gc of ALL THE NSFs in response to another Chinese joke then he (literally not relevant to the convo) just typed""Yes I can clearly understand this""",btohqsg
Like bro NO ONE WAS TALKING TO YOU,btohqsg
And this joke was made like,btohqsg
6h before you replied with that statement we all MOVED ON,btohqsg
Keep in mind that my camp has like MORE INDIAN NSFS THAN CHINESE NSFS BTW,btohqsg
So isg why he keeps getting so agitated abt it,btohqsg
Fr made their way through life on money alone,btohqsg
He complained to me before that his superior in camp did not let him study in camp because his superior gave him work to do,btohqsg
Bruh even if u bs u can't stoop that low,btohqsg
"He also had the balls to like tell his superior ""eh uh I cannot do any ns related work for this month because I need study for a levels""",btohqsg
Like wtf then when my superior like abit pissed offDidn't even say anything abt him btw,btohqsg
He got angry at his superior,btohqsg
i need take 3 months off NS,btohqsg
Then he still had the nerve to tell meEh our superior is in the wrong right,btohqsg
why not just be more efficient with the work he has to do,btohqsg
How did u manage to have him as a friend,btohqsg
playing the race card is low fr,btohqsg
And he doesn't know why I don't tell him personal stuff abt my life,btohqsg
But he keeps trying to ask me abt it,btohqsg
Yeah I think he fr made his way to life based off on money alone,btohqsg
Get the insecure people to fight the insecure people,btohqsg
Idk why but I find RI students unnecessarily insecure in themselves,btohqsg
I think everyone to some degree is elitist,btohqsg
But i feel vjc q elitist,btohqsg
Considering how basically last time in 9div,btohqsg
The posting was controlled by this one vjc student,btohqsg
HE deadass kept EVERY SINGLE VJC STUDENT THAT CAME THROUGH in my office,btohqsg
No matter how useless they are,btohqsg
We had 10 JC students last time,btohqsg
5 of them were from VJ,btohqsg
The other 4 just didn't do anything useful,btohqsg
One Indian guy from vj like IDK,btohqsg
He keeps using race to justify his failures in life,btohqsg
In before he says camvridge is racist that's why he didn't do well for a levels,btohqsg
I wished my brain didn't process that,btohqsg
Oya he told me before he feels like his chem tuition cher was racist cuz his chem tuition cher didn't answer to all his qns on time,btohqsg
How this mfer got a B for gp the first time idfk,btohqsg
But something I noticed is that alot of Indians I interact with fr pull this card all the timeAND I DONT MEAN TO SOUND RACIST HERE but this is just smth I observed,btohqsg
Bro just casually throwing the R word around like any day to day convo,btohqsg
Like the only actual racist situation I've seen in my office,btohqsg
so what happens if that friend meets someone he doesn't like that's also indian,btohqsg
These 2 Chinese superiors started talking to 2 Indian nsfs in chinese,btohqsg
They just say he's north Indian so he's worse,btohqsg
They unironically said that abt someine,btohqsg
damn he's the most racist one ever,btohqsg
There's this indian guy in my office that alot of people don't like (but especially rhe indians)Rhen rhey just say oh it's cause he's north Indian so he's worse,btohqsg
North Indians are poor or smth,btohqsg
a lot of them joke about it too tho. those are damn funny,btohqsg
My friend who's an Indian been to India before and North Indians kinda mean,btohqsg
U need to be able to recognize ACTUAL racism from like,btohqsg
Using race as a reason for why you're ALWAYS failing in life,btohqsg
yeah joking is like my office got one guy when we arrow him smth,btohqsg
Is that dude being FR or like half jokingly using racism for anything everything,btohqsg
"he's like ""eh cb it's bc i'm indian is it""",btohqsg
Oh I also have a friend who said this before,btohqsg
by the time ord he swearing at us in chinese and hokkien,btohqsg
So he acclimatized to the US vibe,btohqsg
i don't like it either tbf,btohqsg
like generally i don't like the use of that word,btohqsg
i think there's a distinct difference between joking about racism which is more of making fun of stereotypes,btohqsg
I hear the n word way too much and people make it the PUNCHLINE of a joke and it's not even like funny,btohqsg
and just throwing around the n word,btohqsg
It's like your mom all over again,btohqsg
how about when nat used it every other line,btohqsg
Cuz he just wanted to pretend to be cool and everything,btohqsg
i ranted in a separate gc,btohqsg
This is just getting more and more cringe,btohqsg
Like some of the shit he said didn't even make sense,btohqsg
Like if u want to roast/read/shade someone for their age like,btohqsg
What he was doing is not it,btohqsg
he tries to make himself look a lot more mature than he is,btohqsg
like the way i viewed it was,btohqsg
Ya thats what I thought as well,btohqsg
I know he was trying to pretend that,btohqsg
"""Oh im not like the other 07 kids""",btohqsg
But he was doing it in a,btohqsg
Like he saw us talking abt zl and Josh and was like,btohqsg
"""AH yes I need to capitalise on this and also hate on zl and josh""",btohqsg
OMFG HDL veggie mala DIY hotpot is so good,btohqsg
Find his way in life someday,btohqsg
he just gives a very condescending vibe to generally anyone lol,btohqsg
as though he knows way better,btohqsg
I mean I didn't rly get that,btohqsg
But I can see how u got that,btohqsg
I just thought he just wanted to act cool,btohqsg
idk him enough but that's what i saw ba,btohqsg
i was just debating at one point do i call him out,btohqsg
he addressed me as old n word lol,btohqsg
his only things he can say to us is we old actly,btohqsg
still miss the guy that dropped the one liner calling me poor,btohqsg
My sister tried to pull that on me by saying that I didnt go to RJC and therefore I'm stupid,btohqsg
As if I didn't perform btr than 90% of the students from that sch,btohqsg
I interact with alot of shitty people,btohqsg
hiii guys  if yall dont mind can help me do my survey ✨ hehe thankkiew 🫶https://forms.gle/8oVTtNFXNCKawLyZ6,btohqsg
dude  just overdoes things LOL while making it seem like  it's a joke at the end of the day,btohqsg
I tot he got like single digit or smth,btohqsg
I stop reply to him when he say he single digit for Os,btohqsg
I see if i can find it,btohqsg
thankfully the one RI person i talk to,btohqsg
are like far from being shitheads,btohqsg
Nvm cant find  but basically he randomly talks about how he have low O level score,btohqsg
the 20% are the loudest tho,btohqsg
Ik more hci people that are normal than RI people,btohqsg
Of the 7 RI graduates that I can recall  2 are normal 5 have pissed me off,btohqsg
Man how did y'all even manage to interact with them,btohqsg
I find rjc Students really insecure for some reason,btohqsg
only had interaction cause of CCA sch exchange/camp,btohqsg
But I think most students in elite jcs fall in this category,btohqsg
for a lot of them it's feeling the need to keep up with the top ones,btohqsg
I did an internship with 3 ri students before,btohqsg
They're work quality was so bad,btohqsg
Like you can tell by the superiors face they were like wtf,btohqsg
you tell me one of the 3 ok but all 3 is q the concerning,btohqsg
Like 0 thought put in that kind,btohqsg
Err I have 1 HCI friend,btohqsg
my post NS intern i worked with mostly JC then one guy finished o levels entering poly,btohqsg
So my sample size also q skewed,btohqsg
the o levels guy had the best work quality,btohqsg
Also idk why but apparantly most RI students go to PPE,btohqsg
Can we add him back here and ask for his o level score,btohqsg
Cuz I was the token non ri guy,btohqsg
In a room of ri kids,btohqsg
And when they did the evaluation at the end by all the bosses,btohqsg
I got higher than all 3 of them combined,btohqsg
But wtv that's just one isolated instance,btohqsg
i got my intern through nepotism but fuck the others all sucked ass,btohqsg
It's also cuz I think I put in the most effort?Like literally it was some ura thing,btohqsg
Supposed to analyze like some area,btohqsg
I did the entirety of bishan,btohqsg
One part of their own neighbourhood,btohqsg
Maybe thats why I had the most to actually talk abt,btohqsg
If that fails I'll just be a backup dancer,btohqsg
i just going to see see the young planner's forum,btohqsg
Jo teo got deported from mnd no meh,btohqsg
Anyways I'm friends with jo teo,btohqsg
The first thing that came into my mind was like kpop backup dancers kinda dancers LOL,btohqsg
Like if she sees me on the street she would say hi to me (I know this cuz it happened when I was abt to go buy dinner a few days ago),btohqsg
Whatever the one is in charge of the people,btohqsg
She's always on the ground at least and she actually listens to her residents opinions and voices,btohqsg
Like she makes changes very quickyl,btohqsg
Especially when she say the shit about ns cannot be measured with dollars and cents,btohqsg
What do u call the MP whose in charge of ur district,btohqsg
all i know about jo teo is she went dhs then rjc lol,btohqsg
When she was in charge of Bishan North she was gd,btohqsg
Then now idk who it is but he's fucking useless,btohqsg
She fucked off during the 2020 elections,btohqsg
And also joteo was q popular in bishan north area at least,btohqsg
Wait but why is joteo in mnd,btohqsg
Maybe her office people are useless,btohqsg
If she's in pmo it'll be q funny,btohqsg
The pmo entrance essay one year when I went for like application to help do stuff,btohqsg
There are 6 infinity stones in the mcu  which infinity stone would be the best to turn into reality,btohqsg
