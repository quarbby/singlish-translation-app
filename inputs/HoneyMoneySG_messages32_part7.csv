Leveraging is the term used to enhance investment yields by taking a loan. For example  if you purchase a bond with a coupon of 10% p.a. and the loan to value (LTV) the bank would give on the bond is 50%  then if you purchase 100k of the bond by putting in 50k of your own money and borrowing 50k from the bank at a rate of 5%  then the yield of the investment would be { [ (10% x 100k) - (5% x 50k loan) ] / 50k your money } % = 15% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.But if loan interest rate rises to say 15%  then the yield would drastically drop { [ (10% x 100k) - (15% x 50k loan) ] / 50k your money } % = 5% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.If the loan taken is larger  the impact is greater. For example  if the LTV Is 90% then on a 100k investment (coupon 10%) you take 90k loan (10k your money):If loan rate is 5% then yield is { [ (10% x 100k) - (5% x 90k loan) ] / 10k your money } % = 55% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.If loan rate is 15% then yield is { [ (10% x 100k) - (15% x 90k loan) ] / 10k your money } % = -35% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.*Note that the numbers used are for making calculations simpler in order to covey how it works. The numbers are not realistic.,btohqsg

Same omg  I‚Äôve been using uob EVOL for around 3 months now  my Cashback was $30+ for the 1st month  but the next two months it was dismal like $1+ üôÉ dk if it‚Äôs something wrong with the way I hit my minimum spending because I‚Äôve been tracking all of my expenses (contactless & online) and made sure I avoided the exclusions of this card‚Ä¶ still trying to figure out this card to use it optimally ü´†ü´†,btohqsg

"Hi guys  I have been tracking my UOB EVOL card meticulously and received $27.23 cashback instead of my expected $40 for Jan statement. Spoke to UOB CSO about it and turns out my transactions for Shopee was categorized not as ""online spend"". I paid using my EVOL card through Google pay on Shopee instead of paying directly on Shopee using the Evol card hence when UOB received this transaction from the merchant it wasn't categorized as ONLINE. Everyone pls beware!!",btohqsg
what application method did you use? SingPass or manual?try manual - sometimes it forces them to review documents,btohqsg
$600-800++ ü•≤ü•≤ just gonna experiment around :‚ÄùD,btohqsg
gotta check T&C closely. some banks categorise in-app GooglePay as online but others have a specific category for it as ‚Äúin-app‚Äù payments.,btohqsg
check the MCCs of your transactions - you may be facing a similar situation as@Samyogen,btohqsg
But if you paid directly in the shopee app using your credit card (not using their shopee pay)  it should be considered online spend right? :o,btohqsg
yes. but Shopee uses a wide range of MCCs (Merchant Category Code)it‚Äôs worth getting in touch with the UOB CSO to ask them whappen - you can use UOB Chat,btohqsg
pay directly wouldn't have this issue. It will be categorized as online spend. just need to becareful when using GooglePay on Shopee,btohqsg
Yeahh sigh I could have missed out some MCCs üò¢ I should clarify with them  thanks :‚ÄùD,btohqsg
I used in app  since I have an account,btohqsg

It works for monthly and yearly. I use the amex true cashback cc,btohqsg
Don't see it. Will it reflect on the app when it is credited?,btohqsg
you mentioned signing up last month so your first statement wont show any cashback. it should be in your next statement,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks for the info,btohqsg
No need to get fused over catagory and just $500,btohqsg
update: CSO has reviewed with mgt and will grant those transactions as online. The balance rebate will be credited in my next statement.,btohqsg
Likely google pay is categorised as mobile contactless (same category as apple pay)  so it prob went towards the spending there. Can‚Äôt confirm but just my gut feel,btohqsg
