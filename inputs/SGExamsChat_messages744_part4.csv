This article highlights both the benefits and potential risks associated with the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in academia. While it acknowledges the convenience these tools offer under academic pressure  it also warns about negative consequences such as procrastination  memory loss  and compromised academic performance. The study discussed sheds light on the usage patterns among university students  but it also acknowledges limitations such as the possibility of bidirectional relationships and the need for further research to explore the broader effects on learning outcomes and health. Expanding this research through experiments could provide deeper insights into the impacts of excessive generative AI usage on students.,btohqsg
Leverage to my personal risk tolerance,btohqsg
Na it's just unlucky with the face cards lor,btohqsg
At least u got a good hand tho like its smth u can play on,btohqsg

u lose all ur money in limp pots,btohqsg
limp pots r the most dangerous,btohqsg
cuz ur opponent can have any 2 cards and theres no incentive for them to fold,btohqsg
thats why the correct play is to rfi (raise first in) when ur hand is good (correlates to position) and fold otherwise,btohqsg
see preflop mistakes will snowball into larger mistakes and tougher spots postflop,btohqsg
by right its def not a raise,btohqsg
but limp pot if im oop i wld bet and if i get raised i fold most of the time,btohqsg
