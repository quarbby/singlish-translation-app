Hi Guy  asking the gurus here.The UOb national saving promo  the term “Earmark” means what?Does it mean if i earmark 50K  i cant touch the 50K at all?,btohqsg

hi anyone knows how much is the interest for FD when applying for secured card of Uob solitaite ?,btohqsg

likely forfeit the cash gift and possibly interest earned up to date  maybe with a small penalty.UOB won't be heartless but don't expect them to give any free lunch.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I recently went back to taking the public transport and I am pairing my UOB ONE with SimplyGo. Heard it’s like the best for rebates on public transport already.Anyhow  question is do I need a SimplyGo physical card to tap on the gantry? I can’t seem to add it to Apple Pay with the card information provided on the app. Any experts know what’s going on?,btohqsg
You can't add your UOB ONE card to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
But if I take the public transport do I tap the UOB ONE card or Simply Go card? Haha,btohqsg
Uhhh then you can't tap gantry using Apple Pay? Sorry I don't get your question...,btohqsg
