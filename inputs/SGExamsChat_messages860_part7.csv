but rainbows might be a good point/topic to set a question on electromagnetic waves,btohqsg
Came out in exam before 2017/19,btohqsg
oh wait nvm yall dk the lore,btohqsg
I mean i did O levels on 2017,btohqsg
ðŸ˜§ what lore happened in 2017 and 2019,btohqsg
I see a Malaysian Law uni-college here /heh/. You do need to sit through 2 Cambridge A-Level to do express A-Levels to UK university I heard.,btohqsg
just realized BAC Singapore now exists lol.,btohqsg
nope definitely never heard about this. Can't even google this up.,btohqsg
I want ask a question   any university in sg use graphing calculator like ti 83 that kind for Math?,btohqsg
I survived University using Scientific Calculator 570EX/ES (Global)  Singapore has its own (97SG series) with some functions disabled.I don't think most course requires you a specific calculator.unless you study Finance or Engineering.,btohqsg
GCs are mostly common in the US.,btohqsg
I tried asking my friend on it but he is ironically busy with engineering course in uni,btohqsg
ah personal take on this. In general Windows Tablets are quite shitty most of the time. An iPad would be a better option. (Also there's Apple Students discount is you have an Education Email or Singapore owns discounted programs).If you need to write physicaly and annotate alot  an iPad goes a long way  when paired with GoodNotes or OneNotes.Mostly is concern is battery life. I'm pro Windows all my life. Sadly Windows battery life is always shitty thanks to its x86 power consumpting Intel CPU. Don't bother looking into any ARM Windows Surfaces those are e-Wastes. Also Surfaces are bloody fragiles without any much cases support.If really if money goes  go get an iPad + MacBook if you are financially ok to get one. Those can get you atleast 5-8 years+.,btohqsg
I need windows for computing lol,btohqsg
Wait you want a computer science course ?,btohqsg
You could consider Samsung tablets if you just need it for light tasks and note taking.,btohqsg
the one with the keyboard  roughly 1.1k,btohqsg
and the screen is the best,btohqsg
Computer for uni courses I suppose,btohqsg
technically the most baller option is get an Always On Gaming PC + iPad with 5G cellular. Buy a TeamViewer / AnyDesk free license.Use an iPad with a Mouse and Keyboard  connect to your powerful Desktop PC at home.,btohqsg
I don't really recommend buying windows surface Tablet as the tablet cost a lot more,btohqsg
Why areWindows 365aren't a thing yet.,btohqsg
2025 Cloud Computing hasn't taken off ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
still a bit confused bc it rlly depends on what you use it for,btohqsg
You mean a subscription version for Windows ï¼Ÿ,btohqsg
Lmao my surface 6 is still working,btohqsg
ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… the money worth it or not ?,btohqsg
ah yes. Where it is cloud computing  where you login your Windows Desktop from the web browser.,btohqsg
I find it light ..can tap,btohqsg
Light is the thing if you're talking abt being windows.,btohqsg
as long you don't drop and crack the surface screen it's alright.,btohqsg
Lowkey want a surface pro 7/8 for 120hz,btohqsg
But can only find on carou,btohqsg
But of course screen not big,btohqsg
My online friend lended me their old Surface Pro 4.It's a nice device  but the screen cmi  because jumping screen defect issue.,btohqsg
But repairability on a Surface is horrible lah.,btohqsg
especially when you know it is a used device  and battery is gonna kong any minute or balloons up,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£cause I don't use all these. No games even install,btohqsg
battery would still degrade over time lol,btohqsg
Cause I used less than 10 x in a yrðŸ¤£,btohqsg
it still happens even without use,btohqsg
But rip my Panasonic laptop.. it was a gd brand though,btohqsg
I dislike Asus laptop. Less than 3 yrs boom,btohqsg
Bleh..I don't even use it to watch Netflix,btohqsg
Well speak of touchscreen  I recalled my school had a store which sells Wacom writing monitor,btohqsg
Ooh Wacom..popular still sells them though,btohqsg
Super useful if you want touch screen on computer without built in touch support,btohqsg
`those are damn expensive hear those monitors costs atleast S$1k+ (but those are for Graphics designers),btohqsg
I think gt cheaper version like 600,btohqsg
Wish more companies tried the surface form factor,btohqsg
