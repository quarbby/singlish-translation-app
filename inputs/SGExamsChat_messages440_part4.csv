that you think the matrix multiplication rule is a definition‚Ä¶,btohqsg
i mean it is a definition and it‚Äôs a definition derived from expressing the transformations naturally,btohqsg
but it is still just a way of writing it,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs still ok to teach them this rule without knowing linear transformations,btohqsg
later your a level results also envelope send to tekong...,btohqsg
then your outfield letter becomes A level cert,btohqsg
Best day to enlist is saturday,btohqsg
Im not even taking olevel this year,btohqsg
just the curiosity lol bc im supposed to do the determinant side of matrices now but if i want to understand determinant i would have to understand linear transformation to understand itüòêüòê,btohqsg
normally i agree that the syllabus doesn‚Äôt cover things properly and simply teaches to follow the method,btohqsg
but linear transformations is one of those things that i think it‚Äôs pretty difficult to fit in,btohqsg
i mean if you wanna teach linear transformations  you can‚Äôt just stop at matrices. it‚Äôs like all the background understanding of vector spaces to learn this one rule,btohqsg
but for the sec sch students it‚Äôs fine to use it as a tool to express a set of  values,btohqsg
That reminds me that there's this really good series by 3blue1brown on linear algebra,btohqsg
yea i watched it back when i was learning it,btohqsg
i used his videos to study for my entire sem in 2 nights,btohqsg
This series singlehandedly saved my math,btohqsg
is it the first time I see them,btohqsg
hi do anyone have the answer booklet for 2020 june o level paper ? if there is  can send the answer key over,btohqsg
wait tm 1 is what time,btohqsg
oh god idw see nanocar driver tmr,btohqsg
why y'all trynna do some pocoyo x nanocar driver collab,btohqsg
I'd rather have a pocoyo x siyan,btohqsg
all i rmb is a Protein called Pikachurin,btohqsg
Lmao i thought it was this too,btohqsg
that'll be me inside not bedok bvz I too short for a normal car,btohqsg
i'm staying up the entire night,btohqsg
I only did that when I was in year 1 for lab report üò≠üôà,btohqsg
scored 9.5/10my friend then took and copy my work  and fixed the mistake  and he got 10/10. üòí,btohqsg
i camped at the faculty building before,btohqsg
I camped at another NS mate's bunk,btohqsg
cos can just submit to the prof under his door,btohqsg
I mean his room. Bunk for NS.,btohqsg
it was quite dumb. 9am to 12 was lab  then my lessons till 8pm.Then next time need submit by 12  but next day lessons start at 8am  2 consecutive lectures till 12.,btohqsg
i'm crashing my gf's room rn,btohqsg
and I still have to have my 1 hour swim after lab work. Cannot let the misc fees go to waste üòÇ,btohqsg
because I took 3rd language  and to ensure no schedule clash  I chose a 6pm to 8pm class,btohqsg
and also because I nothing better to do  take extra modules for 4 consecutive semesters in the first 2 years,btohqsg
So I ended up taking 181 credits worth of modules when the requirement was 161.I figured that learning more stuff for the same amount of $$ and time was good,btohqsg
Unis like SIM charge by number of modules taken. Not sure if that's still the case,btohqsg
I didn't bother because I got a scholarship  let it pay,btohqsg
so take the opportunity to experience everything. Went for student exchange  and went for internship,btohqsg
that time lucky. No covid  no terrorist  no recession yet,btohqsg
all guaranteed spots became not guaranteed in 2020,btohqsg
Quite a few of the places I visited were either bombed or burnt üò≠,btohqsg
I still have souvenir from there,btohqsg
could i ask u kind souls a qn,btohqsg
do yall think bald ppl wear hairnets at fnb operations?,btohqsg
like if theyre working for fnb,btohqsg
