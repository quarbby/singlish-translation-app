(a) Customers try to take advantage of seller. They will try to bargain this and that. They will want/request you to replace the whole durian if one of the seed is bad. They are very picky even after you have cut open the durians. All this added to the cost by a lot!(b) Weather. As durians are natural fruit  you can never guaranteed what is inside. When it rains during the night time  many durians drops pre-matured because of the rain and wind  thus  there are more unripe/half-ripe durians. Supplier do not replace them. Worst still  Pahang durians reached at 10/11 pm because causeway jam. Or durians reach on time but it rains at night. Whenever it rains  it will be the nightmare of durian sellers.(c) Supplier is the biggest crook! One of the reason why durian sellers need to play tricks also because of the supplier. I once told my supplier that I pay $1-$2 more per kg and I want him to give me the best durians. He told me that if all the good durians he gives me  how it he going to clear those not so good durians? When they buy from plantation owners  they have to take in everything and they can‚Äôt choose! They also lose money when the seller owes them a lot money and ‚ÄúRun Road‚Äù! So every basket that they send out  they will mixed some of the bad durians in. This added to the cost of the seller!Normally most of the stall earns about $4-5/kg for MSW. With all the factors that eat into their cost  how are they going to earn if they don‚Äôt use the trick? Still need to pay rents and salary + daily clearing fees for durians husk. Unless the seller owns the plantations!!(some of the famous durian sellers do have their own plantation). Most of the time  sellers use MSW to attract customers and they earn from other types of durians‚Ä¶.They are too many things to share and is never ending. I started this group buy for my Real life friends and it expanded to all of you. Hopefully we can create a healthy community and enjoy durians together.,btohqsg
