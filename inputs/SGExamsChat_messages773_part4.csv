Well u get into a slippery slope argument with your solution. Even if the brand itself commits a good image what happens if they source it from suppliers with no good image?Also u are even presupposing that brands have a homogenous single image which is not the case.,btohqsg
Where does one get that in SG,btohqsg
true  but just bear in mind that in his perspective  he's in the right =XI dunno how you're going to convince him but all the best!,btohqsg
But a bit of it matters,btohqsg
I‚Äôll just let them do what they want as long as they don‚Äôt project their beliefs on to me,btohqsg
ya bro just do what u can control,btohqsg
But tbh i think no one can bbq w/o eating a bit of chaotar,btohqsg
Unless u really talented in bbq-ing,btohqsg
No like u really gotta just eat the chaotar parts by itself for it to be an issue,btohqsg
For the former  it's pretty straightforward. The brand itself would bear the responsibility  not its customers.For the latter  yup  it's an assumption.,btohqsg
Like only if they tell me to boycott some product cos it supports Israel I‚Äôll tell them honestly what I think,btohqsg
Else I better just keep quiet,btohqsg
An assumption which is false. Franchises often get autonomy for their brand image in specific countries,btohqsg
just engage them with a civil conversation. As collagues  need to put differences aside because main target= yall need to work tgt to bring the company/organisation to greater heights,btohqsg
all assumptions are false of course. Otherwise they would be facts...,btohqsg
just tell them what u think lah  i p sure they will respect ur opinion,btohqsg
u can bbq super well with your music pieces though,btohqsg
Yeah it ain't that straightforward because the brand itself does not and is not obligated to bear any responsibility,btohqsg
Boycotts are dumb  people wanted to boycott McDonald's in SG and MY for supporting Israel but realise it's franchised by a Saudi Muslim firm,btohqsg
Saudi never had formal relations with Israel,btohqsg
They're doing more harm to the employees than the company itself,btohqsg
They were going to tho! Just before Hamas attacked.,btohqsg
The Israeli franchise was the one giving food to IDF,btohqsg
Also boycotts means u hit the owners of that company... which most of the time is us because those are publicly listed companies,btohqsg
oh cuz they give free macdonalds to the idf,btohqsg
Even if it's US the public still owns the companies as they are listed so we invest in em,btohqsg
-shrugs- the suppliers have arrangements with them not the customers. So there's no complication.,btohqsg
The globalised world works on who's the cheapest I prefer my cheeseburger to remain cheap,btohqsg
Guess that's why ESG was invented lol,btohqsg
If the company loses money they'll start to lay off employees,btohqsg
Which impacts the public even more,btohqsg
ESG is a whitewash lmao everyone knows that We kept the same lowest cost system in that,btohqsg
Idm if Arnold's Fried Chicken takes over more McD outlets =P,btohqsg
A prof reminded me that McD and KFC only became halal in the 1990s....,btohqsg
Where do u think they will have to source the chicken from...,btohqsg
uh Malaysia? Or are you implying Israel?,btohqsg
I am implying to expand u gotta improve and cost cut your supply chain,btohqsg
End up with the same issue too lol the world will always have demand for chicken üêî,btohqsg
lol who knows  maybe in ten years we'll all be eating crickets and grasshoppers,btohqsg
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/silkworm-pupae-eateries-stop-selling-illegal-sfa-investigating-3401166Meh silkworms are pretty popular in Korea. I'm sure if K-dramas started featuring it  everyone would be eating it... (Snowpiercer came from Korea too LOL),btohqsg
I somehow managed to smoke sth out in a live performance coz i forgot a bit of notes but magically got back to it,btohqsg
Did u go for music theory exam like ABRSM one,btohqsg
Also I didn't know A level has music exam too? Iirc la,btohqsg
Ik Os have cuz last time classmate had to leave early for it,btohqsg
Depends on how the person call out,btohqsg
A Muslim shld give advice and educate other Muslims about such products,btohqsg
Then js let them go man,btohqsg
It's their choice  you did what you could,btohqsg
Oh ok  this was how the person called out@urbanwhisperr,btohqsg
What did A say or do after that?,btohqsg
