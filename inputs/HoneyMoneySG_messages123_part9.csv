insurance mcc excluded. Pay via giro instead?,btohqsg
Nope I have not updated. The low limit was set by myself. Does it have any impact  good or bad?,btohqsg
I guess just impart on your other loan application as unsecured loan amount might count into total debt ratio. And if your card is stolen or lost  ppl can clock the limit on it,btohqsg

Hello Gurus! I'm a miles chaser and I'm planning to buy an iPhone 15 pro from istudio. Which miles card should I use? Uob lady's card seems not possible as istudio is considered electronic store and not inside lady's card qualifying MCCs for the available categories. Kindly advise and thanks in advance!,btohqsg

I have added my SCB account as payee in Maybank app since a long time ago. Recently my fund transfers all have been denied. I have to choose another local bank and it went through immediately. I think maybank might have blacklisted foreign entities supposedly supporting Israel? üòÖ,btohqsg

This is a money making sharing community  please do not bring hatred into here,btohqsg
I used the DBSWWMC + Amaze to pay for USD$1000 item  I completely forgotten that DBS x Instarem is not in partnership anymore.Does that mean in this case  I dont earn 4mpd for that transaction?,btohqsg
Remove your dbs wwmc from instarem now,btohqsg

Hey... I'm just stating my observation and hypothesis... I'm neutral on this matter and I don't see how was my message possibly offending... Its widely reported some Malaysian companies publicly boycotted American companies like KFC  MacD. Don't be so sensitive OK?,btohqsg
actually i don't think he/she is bringing in hatred.it is a fact that banks can do funny things likeblock accounts related to black listed entitieswhether it is israel  electronic coins  or sanctioned countries,btohqsg
It is just like the fact that Singapore Banks do not like doing business with US persons... this is also not a hate statement.,btohqsg
