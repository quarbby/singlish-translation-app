Why no mention the abalone Jin ho jiak tender silky chewy or what,btohqsg
Wah that one must ask him liao. Depends on how much profit he made but I'm guessing is top grade lah,btohqsg
Heng I no more medical stocks le,btohqsg
Anyway  u shudn’t worry much for that. I think big worry is frontline workers,btohqsg
1 month 28 factories supply can cause a big shortage,btohqsg
TG is no.1 glove maker  being shutdown will just drive the price up again,btohqsg
This is company specific news. Not sector,btohqsg
if TG stop production wear PPE la,btohqsg
I think asp already max out. Unless got urgent case need but TG cannot meet target n other glove jack up,btohqsg
TG stop production for at least 2 weeks will cause the gloves mkt to tighten further given their size.,btohqsg
U don't worry for TG  let the company buy back more shares,btohqsg
But sgx 🤦🏻‍♂️ sure all start throwing when TG red..,btohqsg
Just shout ur vested stock huat better.,btohqsg
For ISDN investors  I found this on Investingnote. I found it worth reading and decided to share here. For your information! 😄,btohqsg
Spore took many months to bring down the dorm cases,btohqsg
Will it be the same for silverlake?,btohqsg
Where’s the worthwhile part may I ask,btohqsg
‘I am so bullish about ISDN’,btohqsg
But I not sure my pick will run not,btohqsg
the worthwhile part to me is on the talk about the psychological mindset and the all-out appearance of BBs ba! Sounds pretty relatable to me  given the experience I have in trading at the moment. haha,btohqsg
Haha the comma  gonna get many comments,btohqsg
If anythingThe chart look like reversing down by the way he indicate it,btohqsg
Reinforced my belief that tmr will be a good show for AVAGRA,btohqsg
💘 😻 💜 💛 💚 🧡 💘 😻 💜 💛 💚,btohqsg
Thanks for your view as well I will consider!! 👍,btohqsg
Don’t see the logic behind your assumption. 😁There are two MacDonalds restaurants  one was suspended not bcoz of its food quality but bcoz lack of staffs  the other MacDonalds also suffer?,btohqsg
Don’t get me wrong I’m vested and bullish on isdn tooBut his explanation more towards koyok to me,btohqsg
I think the key isHow many factories does TG have,btohqsg
I think the risk is if can happen at TG may happen at others?Unless a big lapse at TG,btohqsg
Over a few countriesMeans a much bigger % if msia alone,btohqsg
If it does hit other gloves companies  then fair enuf. 🙂,btohqsg
I see. Haha ok. 👍 Glad to have shared and hear your view. I gained another perspective about what I'm reading. Hope to accumulate more experience over time.,btohqsg
Though since feb peak till now no such things in gloves factories. Weird to be happening now,btohqsg
In fact all 28 factories are in Selangor,btohqsg
AstraZeneca said its Covid-19 vaccine  developed along with the University of Oxford  could be around 90% effective.https://str.sg/JbhR📰 Stay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
Isdn good forward profitability  so it deserves to run up. For many micro pennies or all buying on counters to wait for potential run up  good luck. Fomo is dangerous for counters without fundamentals or over run itself.,btohqsg
Now TG got shut down  the other gloves companies will even practice 1000% xtra precaution to end up being next. 🙏,btohqsg
All in STg or STa for non Malaysia operations,btohqsg
So oceanus considered retrace done ?,btohqsg
Yes agreed. All these counters a month ago were dead stocks with little to no volume nor interest. Have to really exercise due diligence when trading these companies  once the music stops and liquidity dries  can get stuck or have to throw many pips down.,btohqsg
I cud be wrong but for time being   dun vest any Malaysian glove counter lo. Juz concern other Malaysia glove counter  factory might face  same issue as top glove due to the spread,btohqsg
A lot of ppl use cpf vest in riverstone,btohqsg
In that case  will be all manufacturing plants  not just gloves alone.,btohqsg
see you use emoji means must go good show liao 😂😂,btohqsg
Rmb the us import ban of TG?... one of the issue was workers’ living conditions....Apparently TG haven done enuf to improve their living condition...,btohqsg
Not sure who is avarga gf,btohqsg
if avarga chiong for the next few days  still got dividend to collect !! huat ah,btohqsg
Where can we find this document ah,btohqsg
Handsome Yang will flip his hand again? $5?,btohqsg
