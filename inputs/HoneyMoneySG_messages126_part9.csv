Hi guys   just wanted to askamaze + Citi miles rewards . I will need to use amaze physical card in order to get the miles from Citi right ?I don‚Äôt believe I could get any Citi miles rewards by linking my amaze card to my iPhone Apple Pay,btohqsg
Hi  am new to Amaze..Can I know what are the advantages to link Amaze to Uob ladies card vs just toping up directly from Paynow for overseas travel? Is it that linking UOB card to Amaze will not incurred the 3.25% bank charges for overseas pmt?,btohqsg
And I can still be able to earn points both on uob n Amaze?,btohqsg
You link uob lady‚Äôs to Amaze to save on fx charge and get rewards on your lady‚Äôs card.If you use Amaze wallet topped up with Payow  you get better exchange rate but no rewards from credit card.,btohqsg
thanks Jasmine. which is recommended? Straight Amaze wallet or to link?,btohqsg
Depends on you. You want rewards from UOB or you want better exchange rate to save some money?,btohqsg
Just some confusion created when watching some of the videos,btohqsg
Ok..understand..I'm using this as a standby card...,btohqsg
If solely on exchange rates  does youtrip still gives the best rates currently?,btohqsg
No income mean not qualify for unsecured cc whether there is referral or not,btohqsg
Any sign up link or welcome bonus to sign for amaze?,btohqsg
You can use mine if no one gives you,btohqsg
Whether you pay with physical Amaze card or tap with amaze card in Apple wallet  your transaction will be converted to online  and you will get 10x on CRMC.,btohqsg
hi  want to ask is it eligible to get gift if I reapply the credit card from singsaver that I had unsuccessful to apply the credit card in past two months??,btohqsg
Hi guys! I am planning for a family trip and the air tickets add up to approx. $6k++. Do UOB KrisFlyer card have limit/cap per month? Or are there better payment methods/cards?,btohqsg
No cap. Though not the highest rate.,btohqsg
which card do you recommend with no cap? couldn't find any better than UOB krisflyer,btohqsg
$6k for sq is Uob krisflyer cc at 3mpd.If u can break the purchase use Uob lady at 5-6mpd better.,btohqsg
"Is anyone's ""shop with max"" button not there for shopee?",btohqsg
By breaking the purchase of $6k  u mean 6 seperate purchase ($1k each month) for UOB lady i believe? I think installment is not an option right?,btohqsg
Uob lady solitaire is $2k cap per calendar month.,btohqsg
But not worth it to break your family $6k purchase. Tickets sure go up in price. Just use the Uob kf cc at 3mpd.U can also explore new to bank credit card offers for $6k sized spend promos,btohqsg
unable to hit the minimum annual income: $120 000 üò¢,btohqsg
Thank you so much Mt! appreciated,btohqsg
Hello experts  back to ask for cashback card payment at SG hotel. I used to rely on evol and live paywave alot  but both dont work for me anymore. I guess I can ask for a link too to make it online.Is the best 1.7% absolute card?,btohqsg
App cannot see. You need to log into Web based. It will reflect your total deposit. If you put in 150k with earmark 50k and 100k in uob one  u will see 150k in total,btohqsg
You will see in mobile app too  in different tab,btohqsg
Is it? I have been trying hard to find,btohqsg
Meaning the 1.1k bonus credit we can safely withdraw right? üôè,btohqsg
Hi asking about the HSBC bonus interest EGA promo..- enrolled for June promo- ~ 30k balance end of July- Today enrolled for Aug promoDoes that mean I should empty out all 30k to ocbc 360 acc to earn interest for Aug then transfer back to HSBC in Sep to earn the bonus interest of 3.6%?,btohqsg
You need to empty out 1 Jul. You cannot enroll for Sep promo already.,btohqsg
Hmm but now that it‚Äôs too late to empty on on 1 July. And enrolled in Aug  does that mean no way to earn the interest anymore?,btohqsg
You can empty on 31 Aug and wait for Oct promo.,btohqsg
But when I enroll for oct promo  does that mean the interest I can earn is only for month of October? (altho the promo is for oct and nov),btohqsg
I thought the Aug promo still on?,btohqsg
3.x% for oct and nov on incremental monthly average balance wrt Sepand1% for oct and nov on incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month if you done min 2k in and 5 transactions. If nov monthly average balance is same as Oct  increment in Nov is 0 so 1% on $0 is $0.,btohqsg
yes but reference month is jul and he kept 30k in jul. In Aug and Sep only get 3.x%  bonus interest on MAB above the 30k.,btohqsg
Yes but the tnc stated the promo is till end Sep. So if he empty in Aug and transfer in Sep. He still can get the bonus interest for Sep right? Although he won't get the promo rate for Aug.,btohqsg
Or both Aug and Sep take reference from Jul? ü§î,btohqsg
Quite a good deal for those yet to use Fairprice app.,btohqsg
From the above explanation from trazora  seems like both take ref to July?,btohqsg
Hi any bros/sis here ever considered an ocbc premier acct? The int is ard 3.2 I think. Is it a good place to park cash if lazy to monitor? Let me know your tots. Appreciate it. Thank you.,btohqsg
Fair price app select the voucher,btohqsg
manually key in the promo code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
