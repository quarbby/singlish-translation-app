At least hv time to think  not on the spot,btohqsg
Most airlines dun hv printed menu,btohqsg
SQ used to  until they cut costs in economy,btohqsg
But agreed  Japanese airlines know what they are doing,btohqsg
They hv printed menu for biz class?,btohqsg
One of the world class airlines,btohqsg
Apparently SQ was no 1 last yr,btohqsg
But not for economy (dk abt premium economy),btohqsg
They just upgraded the premium economy serviceware,btohqsg
Now its porcelain instead of plastic,btohqsg
premium economy is the same as economy except for more legroom,btohqsg
ANAâ€™s economy class is same size as SQâ€™s premium economy class,btohqsg
I was damn shiok by it,btohqsg
JAL has a very special 787 economy cabin,btohqsg
Other airlines use 3-3-3 in 787 economy,btohqsg
Therefore JAL has the widest seats of all airlines in 787 economy,btohqsg
I think 2-4-2 is only for premium,btohqsg
I think in japan ANA is still the biggest airline,btohqsg
JAL has 2-4-2 in economy on the 787 for long haul,btohqsg
787 has SQ's narrowest seat  just 17.5 inches wide,btohqsg
Whereas on a A380  SQ seats are 19 inches wide,btohqsg
Lost all my strength alr after slacking too long gg,btohqsg
But JAL really made a customer-centric decision with the 2-4-2 configuration,btohqsg
N it is the most exðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I think after the turbulence  maybe its ranking will drop,btohqsg
"Can't be helped  Singaporeans like to throw money at SQ cos ""premium""",btohqsg
Need book 5-6m in adv to get tickets cheap,btohqsg
But i have never planned a trip that early on,btohqsg
Nah  I flew JFK-SIN last month in business for SGD 1.5k,btohqsg
And bought only 10 days in advance,btohqsg
You just need to know the tricks,btohqsg
This is not bs by the way,btohqsg
But sorry  I can't tell you the tricks haha,btohqsg
how long it took you to apply for a US VISA?Definitely cheap. lol,btohqsg
I got jump scared by a gym staff,btohqsg
Guys I did it  I pulled a divine reel,btohqsg
im too poor to be in the US oof.,btohqsg
whatever lol i may have just doxxed myself,btohqsg
You can get it for 3.5k lol,btohqsg
Learn to use the gds to price out your own fares,btohqsg
Anyone been to hk can confirm?,btohqsg
you didn't bought from GDS tho?,btohqsg
you didn't bought from GDS tho?,btohqsg
ikea is their freedom from bird cage and coffin homes,btohqsg
No  you find a fare construction from the gds  and give it to a travel agent who tickets it for you,btohqsg
These provide data streams from the global distribution system which airlines use to provide information to travel agents,btohqsg
With the fare codes in these systems you can construct your own custom tickets for cheap cheap cheap,btohqsg
Google Flights will not give you a business class ticket on SQ from JFK to SIN for $1.5k sgd,btohqsg
Depends on how you query the GDS system.,btohqsg
Google Flights simply does not give you availability and inventory for individual fare buckets,btohqsg
