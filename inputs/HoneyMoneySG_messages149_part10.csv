Safer not to do recurring. Manually pay so u have better control. $1k cap per cycle.,btohqsg
Anybody serviced their watches before? Does their MCC qualify for shopping spend?,btohqsg
Just curious  after 55 years old and hit FRS in RA account  the monthly CPF contribution is it all to OA where you can withdraw anytime?,btohqsg
Yup. Any contributions to RA above FRS will be funneled to OA (withdrawable/transferrable). As usual  contributions are made in the order of MA -> RA -> OA.,btohqsg
For RA ERS  is it a must to contribution to max 4x or can be any amount? Example 400k ERS  but can I transfer to 300k instead for slightly higher monthly payout?,btohqsg

Hi  I quite confuse  for EGA bonus interest  is it for 1 or 2 months  I join EGA bonus interest this month  I need to shift my fund to human B next month in order to get bonus interest? Or I can stay in my AC for 2 months?,btohqsg
Oh no I  just realised from SMS  if I had joined EGA bonus on Nov  it means I can't join on Jan 25  right?,btohqsg
2 months. You can stay for 2 months but you will lose 1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards. You will also not be able to join the following promo with the existing monies (have to skip a month).,btohqsg
Can. Always refer to t&c and not SMS.,btohqsg
The following month only get 2.8%? So it better move to human B? But human B joined Dec promo  the increment base on Jan  right?,btohqsg
Yes assuming the promo you're on is 2.8% p.a. Yes. No  reference month is Nov for Dec promo.,btohqsg
Hi all what is best credit card for daily public transport? Thanks.,btohqsg

Hi  would like you check with you experts my math on the UOB KRIS account $100 000 for 45 000 miles.Assuming I put in this 18th jan month the $100 000. Earmark starts from 18 Feb and ends 18 may. Effectively a period of 4 months.I also can hit the spend for the bonus 5% MAB of the $100 000 which will grant me the 5 000 miles each month. (Which is only $1 000 spent without salary crediting)1. 45 000 miles from the earmark promo2. 4x5000=20 000 miles from the bonusMy effective miles earned over the 4 months are Total 65 000I did not include base miles of 1.4 MPD for my prvi card because with or without the account I also earn them.Assuming I am able to get 4.6% p.a for this $100 000. 4 months = $1 533Meaning $1 533/65 000 =$0.02 cpm!??,btohqsg
Haven't checked the maths but 4.6% pa in this low interest environment is a bit overestimating,btohqsg
Hi  can i check anyone gotten their hsbc ega account review/ restricted?Unable to make any transactions.,btohqsg
i calculated it as APPROX 2.9% p.a. interest assuming you value miles at 1.5 cents per mile.65k miles = $975 value975 x 3 = $2925$2925 / $100000 = 2.925% p.a.Great or not? up to your personal miles valuation.My benchmark remains HSBC EGA at 3.8% p.a. currently.,btohqsg
Nope just regular paynow and giro for insurance etc,btohqsg
are the PAYNOW all same first party name... or involved 3rd parties,btohqsg
I think maybe got 3rd parties. But mostly to my wise account,btohqsg
HSBC doesn't like third parties.I remember 1-2 years ago  i was told by the EDD officer than my review was triggered just because of a SINGLE $80k transfer in by one of my household humans (different name than me of course).,btohqsg
I see cso told me they can hold my account 1-2 mths depends. Any tips or advice to deal with this ?,btohqsg
someone should reach out to you...just be honest and provide all the information they ask for.they are concerned with your money being clean or not. They don't care about rewards earning..,btohqsg
I see ok. Been a week already no one called. Going to branch wont help right ?,btohqsg
I am currently using the OCBC 360 and getting the 4.65% with salary and savings atm.,btohqsg
this one i don't know so i don't want to anyhow say.but if you are free and urgently need help  you could try going down to branch,btohqsg
If I have FRS  and I know I get some payout each mth after 65  what happen to the balance if I kick the bucket at 68. Will the remaining balance be diluted  when passed down to children?,btohqsg
Best advice is to check with CSO or at physical branch.,btohqsg
Does anybody knows  if i scan the paynowQR code with google pay  would the money be deducted from my CC or the balance i have in paylah?,btohqsg
paylah (if that is the bank account being linked),btohqsg
Ocbc srs limit still 0... Haiz,btohqsg
Yes... Only can start contributing from mid Jan onwards... I suppose is soon,btohqsg
Hi all  gonna spend a big ticket item which cost 10k above  which card seems to give the best miles with no cap?I‚Äôve done some research and saw  DBS vantage or OCBC infinite has 1.5mpd with no cap. Incase i am missing out i am asking the gurus here too,btohqsg
OCBC Titanium rewards was so good but it was changed to OCBC rewards card -.-,btohqsg
