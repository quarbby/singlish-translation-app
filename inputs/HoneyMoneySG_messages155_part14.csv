Can I check which brokage house has the lowest overall fee currently ( platform fee  commission fee etc ) ?,btohqsg

Good morning all  seeking some advice between Revo and CRMC for subs like Spotify  Netflix  youtube etc?Which one can optimized mpd?,btohqsg
Hello all  I have been using CRMC with amaze to pay for my GIGA phone bill. But now that Amaze is going to charge 1%. What are the alternative?Is it possible to make payment with CRMC before the recurring payment is triggered?,btohqsg
try use crmc for the recurring bill  should be processed as online,btohqsg
Previously have seen others saying that recurring payment will be a different MCC. And will not earn 4mpd.That's why I used amaze.,btohqsg
Good morning  first time user of AxS here to pay property and income tax. Can I ask experienced users when do you usually make payment and do you use a combo of AXS and automated giro?,btohqsg
someone did recommended switching toUOB PRVI Miles Visa Card. i was wondering whats the difference between this and Citi PremierMiles Card on their usage,btohqsg
when is a good time to close a credit card after receiving the sign up bonus? Applied for CRMC in Dec for the $500 cashback and planning to close it. Is there a time period to close so there is no negative impact? (harder to apply next time  lowered credit score),btohqsg
Can you provide more context of that recommendation? Dont seem to make sense to make that switch.,btohqsg
Actually can we use CRMC directly for GIGA? Since its an online transaction?,btohqsg
Hi all  if i alr did 2k/5k n 5 transactions in feb for hsbc ega. Received sms confirmation for feb n march. Do i still need to do in n out inMarch again? TIA,btohqsg
because all these while Amaze + Citi Rewards combo was meant for day to day local spending. and UOB PPV also earns you points on paywave. that is how i understand it. Below was the reply i got when i asked for an alternative for day to day card.CRMC will just become an online-preferred card. There are UOB PPV  VS and Lady's for paywave all are 4mpd but with caveats to each of them.If cannot meet the min $1k spend for VS  then PPV still a better option right?,btohqsg
From what I know  recurring payment will be a different mcc so will not earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Anyone have not gotten the 1% fee yet?,btohqsg
Ok you replied to a question about using crmc on giga bills and asked about crmc vs uob prvi miles visa. Thats confusing for sure.UOB PPV is a decent alternative for offline spendings  as long as you are aware of its quirks  like $5 spend block.,btohqsg
No 1% fee if under $1k as of now,btohqsg
Whats this instapoint redemption? Is it for wallet only,btohqsg
Because you didn't use the merchant with MCC4111 or MCC6540Correct?,btohqsg
so basically PPV is only for transaction more than $5 right?,btohqsg
Hi can i check what is the best mile card to use for travel purchase like hotel bookings.Can uob ppv earn 4mpd for website like agoda/trip.com?,btohqsg
Hi anyone encounter issue not able to waive UNI$ annual fee for UOB ladyâ€™s card? The self serve system said canâ€™t waive and CS agent also said not allowedAny suggestions what to do?,btohqsg
UOB lady travel category or dbs wwmc if booking from OTA.,btohqsg
sorry for askingmore questions.. cause you seem to know a lot haha.now i will completely forget about my Citi Rewards and look for a new card.looking at the perks by PPV  since i will also make a few trips every year  i believe this automatically becomes my first choice?Other than that would be Citi PremierMiles.cause im not so interested in cashback cards.and i believe UOB bank provides 6% saving interest when the criteria are hit right?,btohqsg
You are looking at the wrong card.There is UOB Preferred Platinum Visa and you are looking at UOB PRVI MilesAnd these cards dont qualify for UOB one saving account interest.,btohqsg
Thank you! ok now i am clear,btohqsg
so i still need to split into different cards depending on what i need and do,btohqsg
Strategies for income passive haven't changed for a long time. Maybe you need to be specific on what you want to ask about.,btohqsg
hmm didnt have this issue though. i did it through the app itself,btohqsg
If appeal fail and still want to use the card then pay AF lor..,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check for ocbc 360  for MAB  its cut off at month end right? Meaning when its the new month  I won't need to maintain the $500 increase to obtain the interest for the month?,btohqsg
Or have to maintain all the way until interest in?,btohqsg
firstly u know what is MAB?,btohqsg
First step of passive income is to build the capital (whether money or asset). If you haven't figured the first step  passive income may be an illusion,btohqsg
MAB is based on daily cut off numbers,btohqsg
Passive income is not fully passive ðŸ˜› people need to realise that,btohqsg
When is daily cut off time for mdabHSBC bankUob bank,btohqsg
Oh uob one account i got less interest last month.... not sure is that they changed interest rates? No more 4% 150k max?,btohqsg
So after 1030pm can take out money and move to other banks,btohqsg
It is anyoneâ€™s guessUnless you work for the bank and is authorised to reveal such information as to when their system does the calculation and updates.Any timing given here are just anecdotal and just a guess.,btohqsg
gentle warning that if you game this too much u will get love letters...,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  if I just create account for POEMS with intention to opt in SMART Park possible or must buy share as well?,btohqsg
Might be next business day already.,btohqsg
V trueAs mentioned anyone replying to timing here are just guessing ðŸ˜Š based on anecdotal data.,btohqsg
Buy share is for the funding rewards. Smart park 5% is separate,btohqsg
Did you recieve? It's already March.. FYI I am also wating for the FEB payout.,btohqsg
did a little bit of research and currently looking into these. feels like a good reference,btohqsg
For me simply:UOB PPV - paywaveUOB VS - anything above 1k  e.g. spa package or overseasUOB PRVI - Gen spend  or overseas during 5mpd promoCiti Rewards + AMAZE - OverseasDBS Womans - OnlineUOB Ladys - travel spendUOB point pools  so it's helpful,btohqsg
Not me but I saw dbs already credited this for others,btohqsg
