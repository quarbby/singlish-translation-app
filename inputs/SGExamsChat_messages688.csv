they perceive bullying as kids being kids,btohqsg
but of course if i cant do it on my own ill let them be involved.,btohqsg
anyways. i apologise for all this. i have been bothered for the past few days. thank you all for the great advice that you have given me! üôè,btohqsg
I hope she will be accomodating,btohqsg
I think she wld understand dw,btohqsg
hope it work out for you,btohqsg
Tbh some ppl detention no use,btohqsg
i mean ur time diff from my time,btohqsg
Yea they do take it seriously now,btohqsg
Lmao‚Ä¶but i dun think jc are that into corporal punishment in the first place,btohqsg
after whatever happened at rv where the guy had mental problems?,btohqsg
U can vape in jc w/o being caned,btohqsg
But vaping in sec sch will result in caning,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense but it is what it is,btohqsg
generally there has been a shift in like emphasis on mental health in moe schools over the recent years but I can't deny that that incident may have been like a catalyst that made MOE take mental health even more seriously than before,btohqsg
Actually im just curious if anyone witnessed the sch ruling out corporal punishment,btohqsg
wait but is mental health a good reason to take leave of absence,btohqsg
I saw sm1 being caned in sec sch ah,btohqsg
I heard of someone being caned for using pen knife to cut another student,btohqsg
Idk how did it even happen in sch,btohqsg
And the one that went public (vape + truancy),btohqsg
What did he do? I know someone who got caned in pri sch but in class,btohqsg
Maybe but the rv guy is in a v sad position,btohqsg
I think he got 16y jail,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt do anything serious but always praying a fool and causing trouble,btohqsg
Bro smoking in sec sch tf,btohqsg
My brother would hv been caned,btohqsg
If he was fr ur pri sch,btohqsg
I read about someone vaping + play truant yet complaining about being whacked too hard on stage,btohqsg
Got a new principal who was fierce asf  some mornings he would shout at my friend from the other side of the hall and we could hear him at this end,btohqsg
I actually didnt know there is caning in pri sch,btohqsg
At least it is not in the school hall,btohqsg
But fr what my friend told me experiencing someone being caned,btohqsg
She said it can be a trauma,btohqsg
sometimes we had to leave the classroom to talk because we dont know how they would react and cancel us,btohqsg
But he turned out okay in the end  I think he‚Äôs in poly now or smth,btohqsg
I hv never heard / seen my principals getting angry fr pri sch to jc,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs just to make the student feel embarrassed more than to feel pain,btohqsg
this happened to my secondary school too.,btohqsg
But well the pain is bad too,btohqsg
a guy in my secondary school  who is persistent about never handing up homework and neglecting his studies  was scolded like mad by my principal,btohqsg
If it is public it is worst  i think need make public apology,btohqsg
today no maggie and no gude,btohqsg
scolded so loudly to the point the opposite block could hear,btohqsg
Jc idt I‚Äôve seen anything serious which is surprising lol,btohqsg
Wah im sry but i think it is his fault,btohqsg
i rmb when i was in pri sch got 2 ppl caught smoking outside sch. each person spanked twice in the butt,btohqsg
there definitely have been. just that you werent made aware,btohqsg
Must be them wearing school uniform,btohqsg
theres probably stupid things like that happening at raffles  hwachong or acs... for all you know,btohqsg
I‚Äôve never heard any that‚Äôs the thing,btohqsg
My friend told me got 2 guys in her jc called vaping in sch but only made to say apology,btohqsg
Like even in my jc everybody was chill. More so than sec and pri,btohqsg
most of the people in my class are chill.,btohqsg
Ya in the discipline aspect  jc is q chill,btohqsg
Except for getting detention for being late,btohqsg
the boys are rather nice too,btohqsg
But pri sch smoking is a bit‚Ä¶,btohqsg
wont it have a toll on your attendance grade?,btohqsg
I think is parental issues sia,btohqsg
everyone got different growth rate mah,btohqsg
I think he meant take gap yr,btohqsg
But it needs a valid reason,btohqsg
no idea. i graduated from secondary school last year.,btohqsg
i just heard him say that his family is moving to australia or something,btohqsg
But if u tell me someone has not grown at 18y/o,btohqsg
Ok tbh i did things i regret in jc la but‚Ä¶,btohqsg
no no i mean study capacity,btohqsg
But tbh if u dun hv study capacity  it is freaking hard to do well in jc,btohqsg
Like u cant even piece urself tgt and sit down and do ur work and at the very minimum even ur homework????!!!!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
the true question from a phd student,btohqsg
My brother must be v lucky,btohqsg
He got into trouble w a bunch of friends,btohqsg
For cursing vulgars to this girl in the class gc,btohqsg
Actually it is weird im saying this coz it is me right now,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall got people drink in Jc campus?,btohqsg
pte ended and my parents alr squabbling with each other in the car,btohqsg
No not that i know of,btohqsg
and my dad telling me to read up on my sister's notes for econs when she took h2 eckns,btohqsg
Tbh im surprised my cohort tm no gangster,btohqsg
Esp compared to sec school where there‚Äôs so many,btohqsg
Maybe coz there are only that many jcs and the real gangsters didnt make it,btohqsg
But just dun be like me,btohqsg
also like my dad keep comparing me to my sister and just abt every other person in singapore,btohqsg
if you put a zebra emoji and then a lion emoji together  would the lion emoji chase the zebra emoji,btohqsg
he say must be the best,btohqsg
Actually tbh let me be honest again,btohqsg
"then my mom say ""just compare with yourself that's what matters""",btohqsg
Good enough to get to wherever UW to be,btohqsg
Used that as a motivation to study hard,btohqsg
it‚Äôs okay im the only person he can‚Äôt compare to,btohqsg
I remembered there was this day,btohqsg
he already comparing with my classmates bc he thinks they're international students,btohqsg
‚ÄòI will prove to u i will do better than u in As‚Äô,btohqsg
mostly indian classmates then my dad assume they're international students,btohqsg
then i also told him abt the PRC guy good at physics + girl with autism in our class,btohqsg
They cant say they know more abt ur class than u,btohqsg
then he immediately compare me with them,btohqsg
There is a girl w autism in ur class????,btohqsg
My bro didnt even make it to pathlight,btohqsg
At least she should be ok ish,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in NA I know the express student tho,btohqsg
Wait the cher openly told the clas??,btohqsg
My cher refused to tell our class what actually happened to this mia girl,btohqsg
yeah ms pang came to our class and talked abt her,btohqsg
Oh the pte is in class,btohqsg
I tot it is like whole cohort,btohqsg
Is it ms or mrs pang ah,btohqsg
the way my parents keep arguing i think my dad gonna crash,btohqsg
If not u can be her first,btohqsg
our class got a few girls who will look out for her,btohqsg
some will still accomodate her but some also try to avoid her as much as possible,btohqsg
Can i just say there are few people who understands people w autism,btohqsg
But im speaking fr a perspective of those who legit will hv a meltdown,btohqsg
i feel like sometimes during fmath class she will almost lose it over not being able to do a qn,btohqsg
Im surprised she chose to take fm,btohqsg
i personally know quite a few people that had their jc time be not really working hard then uni fr wake up wake up,btohqsg
As long as ig don't legit bully or smth,btohqsg
Mine is the opposite help la,btohqsg
i mean my friend who was from MJ and messed up A levels,btohqsg
A levels never wake up and uni still havent woken up,btohqsg
end up getting nie scholarship while in undergrad,btohqsg
it‚Äôs the nie qualification for people that alr got degree,btohqsg
Ok maybe i wun know coz it is too far awayüíÄ,btohqsg
But im also dumb in a sense,btohqsg
I choose course base on my grades,btohqsg
my idea is if i‚Äôm tired of academia or working in industry,btohqsg
i go try to be poly lecturer lmao,btohqsg
omg when can I attend Dr siyan lecture Nm,btohqsg
You might meet someone you'd once knew si yan!,btohqsg
This is funny fr someone w autism to discourage that,btohqsg
we all go crash his lecture,btohqsg
if i‚Äôm TAing a class and you sat in i wouldn‚Äôt care,btohqsg
Dr siyan please save me im DROWNING,btohqsg
you don‚Äôt even need to crash pls,btohqsg
You know it was such an honour to attend a university lecture ish  man I didn't know the prof would address their colleague starting w prof too,btohqsg
some profs are on first name basis with even phd students,btohqsg
like my fyp prof i just call him tim,btohqsg
idt they want me bc my rp was shit,btohqsg
and i wave a big banner,btohqsg
i will also get my friends to cheer for u,btohqsg
Today morning we did drakihonnu cheer at 827am in the hall üò≠,btohqsg
MT in sept is NOT IT,btohqsg
new kids must suffer thru chinese longer now,btohqsg
avg mt msg gonna be 9,btohqsg
aiyo starts frm my sister's batch,btohqsg
we're punishing the skibidi gen for ruining our lives by singing the skibidi toilet theme over and over again!! hooray!!,btohqsg
I almost choked on my food,btohqsg
Nah I just ate a snack,btohqsg
lol only affect o level students,btohqsg
i rmbr doing 3 pprs in one day,btohqsg
everyone take exam at the same time,btohqsg
idk y but i still rmbr the day. 16 sept 2022üíÄ,btohqsg
this chat has gone from ns gc to tm gc,btohqsg
hmmmm see la who here was/in tmjc,btohqsg
i should have gone tm to join the legendary gang,btohqsg
meanwhile idk how to help myself coz I need to do work but I can‚Äôt seem to process anything,btohqsg
i oso got b4 in sec sch but it wasnt the good kind,btohqsg
Like it is me staring at my notes,btohqsg
There will always be someone at the bus stop,btohqsg
i been to mjc b4. for fking lockdown evacution drill,btohqsg
damn i oso want free ppr,btohqsg
But I took a long long break from 7-9.30,btohqsg
And I hv this weird ass friend,btohqsg
I tell him nothing is getting into my head,btohqsg
He reply ‚Äòwhat have u studied so far‚Äô,btohqsg
let's break down your notes into smaller chunk and revise 1 step at a time?,btohqsg
Maybe this helps a bit coz I hv been really unproductive and I can‚Äôt afford to screw up any more exams,btohqsg
Coz I think part of this lack of concentration is seeing there is a 65 pg slide,btohqsg
yeah like I find that whenever I try to revise and nothing goes in my head  i just tell myself ''ok let's just revise this 1 paragraph first and see how'',btohqsg
then paragraph after paragraph  divide and conquer,btohqsg
Know how to do the last qn,btohqsg
Cuz is Yeo li kwang set the paper,btohqsg
I send U when I get back,btohqsg
Have full mark for that one,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to do 2(a),btohqsg
4n¬≤ + 3n + n = 4 n¬≤ + 4nThen can factorise 4 out to 4 sigma ( blah blah),btohqsg
or break it into concepts. whenever i encounter like parts with a ton of slides  it's more digestable if i look through and see what are the diff sections  so instead of oh there's 65 slides  there's 10 concepts  etc,btohqsg
every time you finish one it's like 10% done,btohqsg
instead of thinking of 600+ days to ORD  i just take it as 2 years@chemcer,btohqsg
‚ÄúI understand that some may be concerned that they will have one less chance to improve their MTL (mother tongue language) grades ‚Äù said Mr Chan.‚ÄúBut we need to strike a careful balance between striving for excellence  chasing the last mark and allowing our students to learn at a better pace.‚Äù,btohqsg
Genuine question though  who benefits from taking o level mt twice anyway,btohqsg
From my understanding  the grades from the paper in june and then october for a person wont differ by much anyway,btohqsg
grades are not important after the next stage in life,btohqsg
i feel that taking it in may/june takes lesser toll on me,btohqsg
jus finish that one subj  get it done n over with,btohqsg
is 77kg as a 1.7m person considered fat (asking for a friend),btohqsg
depends on the body fat. I was 79kg as 1.7m and i was fatter than now even though now im around 83kg,btohqsg
on the heavier side but certainly not overweight,btohqsg
why leh ctk u 77kg and 1.7m ah,btohqsg
you need a smart electronic scale  the xiaomi one quite good,btohqsg
ok no one asked but did u know u can share word doc and edit concurrently with your grp mates,btohqsg
how can an electronic scale calculate body fat üíÄ,btohqsg
and tbh  you can tell by looking into the mirror also....,btohqsg
my cousin told me people count down as early as ns starts,btohqsg
as in looking at your friend,btohqsg
or ask you friend looks into the mirror himself,btohqsg
i started counting right after a level HAHAHAH,btohqsg
counting down when ur enlist jus gonna make u stress tho,btohqsg
weight itself doesn‚Äôt say a lot,btohqsg
i think bro has heavy bones...cos he doesn't look fat,btohqsg
instead start to count down after u gonna ord,btohqsg
look at yourself and watch your health,btohqsg
my friend got the latest possible enlistment,btohqsg
bones dont weigh that much in the grand scheme of things....,btohqsg
im counting down to my last exam already,btohqsg
i used to tell myself i have heavy bones when truth is i was fat,btohqsg
i‚Äôm counting down to becoming Dr,btohqsg
during my internship  i was forced to learn how to use that stupid motorcycle machine,btohqsg
im counting down to my Nobel prize,btohqsg
mosquito is very naughty  my WHOLE leg is in itch,btohqsg
you‚Äôre be counting down when you‚Äôre dead bruh,btohqsg
this reminds me of the school camp calamine lotion cheer,btohqsg
10 more exams 3 more assignments,btohqsg
literally it is one part of how i cant concentrate at all tdy,btohqsg
my favourite cheer is the i take my love,btohqsg
speaking of which my ippt is like 1 year down the road,btohqsg
guys go for ntu open house,btohqsg
should i start to train now,btohqsg
and my first mid terms is in 3 days,btohqsg
nus pharm talk i think soon,btohqsg
reservist ippt to pass is how many points ah,btohqsg
if i come can i see you,btohqsg
u can see my rapper prof,btohqsg
i think i will start afresh tmr,btohqsg
there is no point forcing myself tdy if nth is getting into my head,btohqsg
but not everyday has a tomorrow,btohqsg
true but at the same time plan your days out instead of just trying to whack and feeling demoralised after,btohqsg
speaking of which  i need to improve on time management:-(,btohqsg
but can be so shit until cannot sub 15?,btohqsg
this wednesday  i got an exam  do an entire pharmaceutical care plan in 10min and present it in 3min,btohqsg
at the end of the day the day ends  it all comes down to skill issues,btohqsg
partition your blocks of time tmr then. 70% content for everything is better than trying to 100% then end up half of it got nothing,btohqsg
this is so true man  like if im slow at processing means i am slow  there is nothing i can do to rush it out and come out with nothing,btohqsg
rn you‚Äôre just trying to get over the finish line so just buckle up and do it,btohqsg
it is not the right time to give up but i feel like im right now:-(,btohqsg
but nevermind i will just push through this final stretch,btohqsg
@kohsyanevery phd students during their final year  they cannot back out,btohqsg
there‚Äôs arguments to both sides la tbh  not always sunk cost,btohqsg
u cant remember what u sent???,btohqsg
but at least in sg there‚Äôs a more set timeframe,btohqsg
jiayous man that is far away:-(,btohqsg
4 years also which is alr short for phd,btohqsg
oh and there is me who tot phd mostly 2y,btohqsg
masters 1-2 years. phd anywhere from 4-8 years or more,btohqsg
omg what mosquito is this that can bite the whole leg,btohqsg
thing is not like you‚Äôre incapable of studying it. it‚Äôs a motivation thing so find ways to get or trick your brain to cooperate,btohqsg
some australia uni can fast game with 3years,btohqsg
take my words with a pinch of saltgive up  so you dont feel stress  then just do your work carefree then you will be more productive,btohqsg
true  i think i need to somehow get some motivation and not be sitting at my desk sometimes thinking about other things while studying:-(,btohqsg
coz i believe no one can multi task while studying,btohqsg
tho i know of genius who can do that,btohqsg
study 2 subjects at once xD,btohqsg
...chuanruan sia...my dad complaining about mosquitoes  than now my whole leg itchy and full of mosquito bites,btohqsg
wah this person ah can smoke chem then can study 2 subjects at one go,btohqsg
i watch youtube or twitch while studying,btohqsg
real  like how i wrote 2 econs essays for a level at 1 goleft hand micro right hand macro,btohqsg
coz i dunno how is that possible,btohqsg
the next thing is u get 5.0 gpa,btohqsg
more like i drown out the vid when focusing on work then after one concept i watch a bit,btohqsg
idk it‚Äôs made me never burn out,btohqsg
during finals i did this from 11am to 4am every day,btohqsg
i cant focus if there is any bit of noise,btohqsg
i cannot listen to any music with words,btohqsg
so sometime my dad talk too loudly on the phone  i will get pissed and just close the room door,btohqsg
coz nothing will go in at all,btohqsg
i‚Äôm the kind that would rather study at a cafe than library,btohqsg
i would rather study at home coz i lazy get myself out of the house,btohqsg
but need those quieter ones leh,btohqsg
also like price of it hahaha,btohqsg
this actually reminds me of i think during A levels study break  there was one day i legit woke up at 11am and luckily my dad woke me up  and i got so angry with myself and then i rushed my breakfast and went to study,btohqsg
need to ask our brother SAF to get you one man,btohqsg
eh i‚Äôm not bothered at all regardless actually,btohqsg
and tbf price i can afford la,btohqsg
you need some other priorities in life ngl,btohqsg
macbook is nice for work outside,btohqsg
that stress is gonna drive you insane,btohqsg
i dun really use mosquito repellent but maybe i should  as what my friend put it  my house is a jungle,btohqsg
for legal reasons i‚Äôm not endorsing,btohqsg
i regretted pushing hard at A levels and not enjoying the good school life,btohqsg
i recently went to study once at starbucks cause i got starbucks gift card and wow. $10 gift card can cover 1 large drink only ah haha,btohqsg
only reason i don‚Äôt like cafe is its unhealthy la to drink those all the time,btohqsg
i tot sometimes they chase people out if too crowded,btohqsg
the price isn‚Äôt an issue for me,btohqsg
meanwhile  only starbucks coffee seem to be effective for me,btohqsg
its not too bad in terms of unhealthy,btohqsg
then its gna be hard for u,btohqsg
so if i want coffee its gotta be more unhealthy ykwim,btohqsg
i went to the plq starbucks last sun. entire afternoon full but staff never did anyth,btohqsg
no i‚Äôd rather take 0 coffee,btohqsg
ya i used to camp there for my a lvl,btohqsg
just that if i want coffee it‚Äôd be unhealthy,btohqsg
at starbucks i‚Äôd rather get the tea stuff yea,btohqsg
i was the seat hoarder im sorry,btohqsg
A levels im either in school or at home,btohqsg
"always in bed when ""studying"" for a lvl",btohqsg
during finals i drank a carton of red bull and uh,btohqsg
it is better than me blacking out during pe,btohqsg
coz i was walking to retrieve the tennis ball and then suddenly fell to the floor,btohqsg
a bit late but you can learn to do that while working. in fact it‚Äôs even more important imo,btohqsg
if life is just work it‚Äôs gonna suck,btohqsg
like i literally walking and then just suddenly knelt down,btohqsg
and then just so sway it was over a drain cove,btohqsg
then after resting for awhile i started to feel black out symptoms like the things became black and white  chest discomfort and all,btohqsg
hmm i passed out a bit during flag raising,btohqsg
once you finish uni it‚Äôs like 100% up to you even more to find a life outside work,btohqsg
i think i skipped math class after recess,btohqsg
because i was at the go,btohqsg
saf is the life you didn‚Äôt think you needed,btohqsg
and mr lim yew wei scolded me for not wearign back my skirt,btohqsg
skipping math class what a rebel,btohqsg
i remembered the pe cher forced me call my parents,btohqsg
my friend used me as an excuse to skip class,btohqsg
my friend used me as an excuse to skip class,btohqsg
that time to accompany me at the GO,btohqsg
and then we bumped into my econs cher,btohqsg
and my econs cher told me 'it is probably u did not sleep',btohqsg
TOH what did ur cher say the next time u met her,btohqsg
no wonder ns can eat 2 ration,btohqsg
i remembered my friends helping me in the toilet wash my wound and i was crying like a baby,btohqsg
my pain tolerance is really low,btohqsg
oh so u took their calls,btohqsg
meanwhile me fainting in push up position in ns,btohqsg
i cant help but you are really a joker:-(,btohqsg
meanwhile for the whole of j2  my econs double period is 1st period in the morning and the tutor always reach the classroom before my class,btohqsg
ah ok then it is not too bad,btohqsg
wait i didnt know there were tutorials in nov,btohqsg
uk after prelims right  my chem tutorials were mixed class and then it is so awkward coz we were grouped with 2 other smart classes (18s101 and 18s309) and then there was even a 2 row gap in between 101 and my class lol,btohqsg
but then i was shooked for the first time not hving to deal with my chem cher teaching,btohqsg
we were grouped with the HOD's classes,btohqsg
i remembered after j1 promos my chem cher left us then there was a temporary cher...he freaking wrote on the whiteboard how many people get each grades...,btohqsg
and then scolded us coz only 2 A,btohqsg
when it was the first time we seeing him lmao,btohqsg
i cant remember his name but he wear no frame spectacles and look a bit like mr bryan leong,btohqsg
but let me see his pic,btohqsg
were u one of them  chem god ü§£,btohqsg
imagine getting anything higher than a D for chem in jc,btohqsg
apparently he took over as subject head for chem,btohqsg
based on a real story(chemistry prelims),btohqsg
i beat you with my U,btohqsg
i remembered she gave me a weird stare during award ceremony,btohqsg
but i also stupid idk why i turned to her direction,btohqsg
i rmb my highest ever for chem internals is a C but only cos they made promos easy,btohqsg
i was never good at jc chem,btohqsg
or jc anything for that matter,btohqsg
xavier remember i shared the stage with my 'fav' principal before:-(,btohqsg
wth how has it been 1h,btohqsg
what if it is coz u got smarter,btohqsg
Nah my GP cmi for internals,btohqsg
but that edit means u got A for As,btohqsg
Cuz they grade deflation a lot,btohqsg
i cmi in internals AND As,btohqsg
no la is cause they made the paper easy cos the only time they showed cohort mean is during promo ü§£,btohqsg
other internals too cui to show alr,btohqsg
i tot they show every exam,btohqsg
i got C/D in internals then B for A levels,btohqsg
Yeah idk how cuz highest I got in sch was C,btohqsg
jc1 mye  heard that cohort had 65% Us  never showed mean during review,btohqsg
i tot my mye d was bad enough,btohqsg
There are people who consistently get A in sch but then B for actual,btohqsg
meanwhile my class have at least 5 Us throughout all exams,btohqsg
My 53.2% in JC1 MYE alr enough to be top 20% lol,btohqsg
let me check my mye percentile,btohqsg
yeah common thing from what i know,btohqsg
The GP paper 2 was on zoos,btohqsg
i even heard chem consistent A to B,btohqsg
but that one imo isnt spsed to happen,btohqsg
For my AQ i just bombed the fact that my school brought all p5 to the zoo,btohqsg
That was actually never a thing,btohqsg
iestin are you gonna be at the open house,btohqsg
But apparently good enough to buy myself an A,btohqsg
I want to go enjoy the start of my recess week,btohqsg
Fk la i actl believed bro was in uni for a moment despite all the red flags,btohqsg
Jb massages pls my shoulders cant shoulder the burden of me crying anymore,btohqsg
convince mi people to join spms,btohqsg
I dont think i need to,btohqsg
i told u i love my physics cohort for giving me free subject prize,btohqsg
yea i was in equal shock then i came to realize the hybrids seem to not care about their grades. and i think in one of the exams in j2 i was both top scorer + on the most improved list,btohqsg
can‚Äôt be ok with someone that takes only H1 physics‚Ä¶,btohqsg
at least better than someone that dropped it to take geog,btohqsg
Idk why I even bother coming home,btohqsg
Uhh nth much la is just that my parents want me to stay up to go pick up my sister when she's done with her stuff LOL,btohqsg
Cuz they dw stay awake anymore,btohqsg
lol but you just got home?,btohqsg
Apparantly they had no backup plan if I chose not to go home tonight,btohqsg
i suck at physics at Os  my physics went from consistent C5 to a magical A2 at Os,btohqsg
I have a place away from my parents,btohqsg
The only other place I heard this happen are Indian universities,btohqsg
my o lvl physics was also somehow a fucking A2,btohqsg
Is just I occasionally come back to collect studd,btohqsg
The maths papers are so hard that if you even get 40%  you are the top in cohort,btohqsg
1. How reliable are statistics as a guide for planning the future?2.

ok but thato ne is to be expected,btohqsg
No that's diff; that's a competition and competitions are normal to be like that,btohqsg
The one I mentioned is their uni exams,btohqsg
why u suddenly post this  give me a level ptsd,btohqsg
Bro fr pulled out 2020 gp paper 1,btohqsg
i actually tot the CMEg thing was a joke,btohqsg
i didnt know it was real,btohqsg
well is the final grade bell cuved though,btohqsg
lol then thats actually messed up,btohqsg
meanwhile there is tm where i think the top scorer for h1 math is full marks,btohqsg
h2 math probably has some genius but i dunno their score,btohqsg
"So when they applied to PhDs elsewhere they need a special explanatory note to explain that their ""fail"" 40% is actually top in their uni",btohqsg
to be expected since its iit,btohqsg
meanwhile the highest in h1 physics is 79,btohqsg
uk i was an asshole inj2,btohqsg
i think everyone will know IIT is prestigous enough though,btohqsg
coz right at j2 prelims  there was this guy in my class who tied with me at 78,btohqsg
but i was lucky my paper got calculation error,btohqsg
Reminds me of what my friends did to me,btohqsg
then the next day in school  i was so eager to get it corrected,btohqsg
They took my paper and argued why I should not have gotten the mark for one qn,btohqsg
So I won't be first in cohort lol,btohqsg
and i cant imagine mr bryan leong was actually fast in changing the list lmao,btohqsg
welcome to sg i guess  ppl will do anyth to pull others down and push themselves up,btohqsg
then ask her study harder omo,btohqsg
Eh they were just salty of me,btohqsg
Cuz I didn't study and got 180/180,btohqsg
there was no one that was even close to my grades in my class except econs,btohqsg
So they tried to lower my score?,btohqsg
So idk how u argue if someone deserves the mark or nit,btohqsg
wah then there is really nth to be salty about,btohqsg
not everyone and prestige won‚Äôt matter compared to what‚Äôs on the transcript if it‚Äôs a fail,btohqsg
it is a skills issue alr,btohqsg
meanwhile mine was not about people being salty,btohqsg
for a lot of unis in US or Europe  unis in other parts of the world are pretty unknown,btohqsg
but they always act surprised at my marks  especially chem,btohqsg
mine is they know i study but act surprised,btohqsg
wah and ur cher is sleeping?,btohqsg
it is better than my classmates who never finish work,btohqsg
Josh when he realizes yt didn't fail a levels,btohqsg
i want him here just for a short while,btohqsg
my chem chat full of cher chasing for hw submission,btohqsg
He joining back on April's fool,btohqsg
uk something im really surprised about is my physics cher saying the trend has been that the top scorer is from the arts class taking physics,btohqsg
My most useful skill i took away from ns,btohqsg
Is looking busy when I'm actually not,btohqsg
For my batch I think all the arts subject was topped by science students,btohqsg
my batch the people are no where near the top of the list lmao,btohqsg
wait‚Ä¶so they never take math at all ah,btohqsg
my class dominated but there is only like 3-4 As (that is the highest omo),btohqsg
i think my year physcics paper had to draw 20 marks of graphs,btohqsg
2018 a level phy p3 q1  all sketching,btohqsg
Shit my superiors like to dump work on me,btohqsg
Because to them higher rank = more work,btohqsg
then there was a class where there was only 1-2As????,btohqsg
iestin did you have to draw spacetime diagram for nelly,btohqsg
Given how fucking bad my graph drawing is im surprised i survived it,btohqsg
there is 1 arts class taking physics i think,btohqsg
but i dunno their other subjects,btohqsg
I think during the take home mid terms 1 there was such a question,btohqsg
going out of the way to not take math  to take phy  i wont be surprised haha,btohqsg
But during mt2 and finals not at all,btohqsg
some people just want to avoid math,btohqsg
Shes so nice she included a 20% presentation component nobody asked for,btohqsg
but then isnt phy applied math,btohqsg
right but i guess the formula is not as complex as math,btohqsg
i remembered in sec 4  i was having problems rememberinf physics formula  then once exam start  i vomited out the electric formulas on the cover page,btohqsg
the math in jc physics is limited to algebra and simple differentiation,btohqsg
i‚Äôve done that in uni before actually lol,btohqsg
Cuz none of the other admins is active,btohqsg
for math yes  for physics no,btohqsg
and it‚Äôs just to understand the significance of gradient of the graph and not really doing any differentiation haha,btohqsg
i only rmb it from like SHM?,btohqsg
Isnt it the one with the like,btohqsg
Eh we talking abt jc physics or o level,btohqsg
O level physics introduce radioactivity :D,btohqsg
Then had to use differentiation and integration LOL,btohqsg
or is it h1 dun hv,btohqsg
cause schs always like to overteach and test out of syllabus stuff,btohqsg
But its probably just an ej thing,btohqsg
For which one  i think sometimes the h1 phy got change syllabus,btohqsg
Idk ej papers always have this one,btohqsg
time to prescribe medication to yourself,btohqsg
ok im so not a pharmacist talking medical cock,btohqsg
Thrs once we had to calculate gradient for a graph,btohqsg
But they never give us gridlines,btohqsg
ya but he dw reply me,btohqsg
Apparanty they expected us to draw our own grid,btohqsg
Precisely because he has a thousand ccas,btohqsg
meanwhile i hv not started studying my econs exam,btohqsg
Yeah this is why I never got an A for ej physics,btohqsg
Har wait i where got dont reply you? :0,btohqsg
what mod is that. some intro to econs mod in nus?,btohqsg
All this random things in my paper that I'm too lazy to di,btohqsg
i was prioritising my pharm mod,btohqsg
Orh i think i miss this one,btohqsg
this is like not extra to help prep students better lmao this is extra for the sake of it,btohqsg
Wrote a report to the department,btohqsg
To point out every single thing in their paper that was not in syllabus,btohqsg
Or that went against cambridge examiner report,btohqsg
i‚Äôm like thinking how many physics teachers looked at that sort of question and is like,btohqsg
It was a 16 page document I think,btohqsg
ah yes this is what we should set,btohqsg
They didn't talk to Tay student ever agsin,btohqsg
Everytime he got concern and queries and consult,btohqsg
No they deleted my ejc email,btohqsg
I think the excuse was smth ljke,btohqsg
