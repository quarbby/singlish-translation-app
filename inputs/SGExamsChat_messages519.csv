did u shout OWADIOOO on enlistment day,btohqsg
If a problem can be check in polynomial time does it mean solution can be solved in polynomial time?,btohqsg
Idk I might be wrong in the explanation,btohqsg
i have no idea i didn't take a math,btohqsg
No.. if start I won't be here,btohqsg
Yes bedok meanwhile u will be here for the next 1.5 years,btohqsg
There is a stickerpack for that,btohqsg
Sayang u wan be hall rommies,btohqsg
sian this my life right now,btohqsg
530 is rev  but i wake up 1 hr earlier prepare,btohqsg
fill bottle   pack bag n shit,btohqsg

my unit sent to the most lanjiao venue of all,btohqsg
They can't..  we rely on trade,btohqsg
send me to prbi i got direct bus back,btohqsg
Gotta have the money to pay 2M in PM salaries,btohqsg
Once supported then your Students Portal Access will get revoked,btohqsg
Lanjiao Idw stay in hall 1 and 2,btohqsg
3.4 so 2M sing is errr,btohqsg
Probably about the same amount Najib took from 1MDB per year,btohqsg
Ok not rlly its the sing dollar appreciating against the MYR,btohqsg
MYR compared to other currency didn't move much,btohqsg
But that also means business get lesser competitiveness,btohqsg
U will get another riot pls dont,btohqsg
Funny enough I'm going Malaysia layer lol,btohqsg
Not riot bro that one different,btohqsg
I go overseas only for 1 provision,btohqsg
It's not that u give too little credit to em liao,btohqsg
Malaysia when u drive u notice 1 thing,btohqsg
This makes it hard like physically too to project powers etc,btohqsg
Basically they did well In the thing that matters the most,btohqsg
It has always been a tug of war but the east side always had little say simply cuz of its tiny population,btohqsg
Like Borneo and Sarawak is even worse when it comes to population,btohqsg
I never when there cuz there simply was never a reason,btohqsg
U went there by boat isit,btohqsg
I mean I don't understand where the demand comes from,btohqsg
Oh so nature tourism that kind.,btohqsg
I thought Everest Kilimanjaro then Kinabalu third ah?,btohqsg
No 3rd is like some unknown mountain,btohqsg
All are in the himalayas region,btohqsg
No like the everest mountain range,btohqsg
Third highest mountain on a island hahah,btohqsg
Yeah on an island but like what is an island..,btohqsg
A island is a land mass that is not connected to another land mass from any other sides,btohqsg
No I meant the island itself that's the island of Papua,btohqsg
I’m guessing cause it’s still considered be as a Australian territory,btohqsg
It is like how the Borneo is Malaysia Indonesia and Brunei,btohqsg
Calling Australia a island would be like calling the UK a Island nation,btohqsg
No it won't because we won't call it the UK already,btohqsg
Australia the continent and Australia the country are 2 distinct terms,btohqsg
We would just call it Scotland England and Wales,btohqsg
Btw I’m very sure Australia’s continent is called Oceania,btohqsg
Oh boy that's another can of worms,btohqsg
Indeed cause Taiwan is part of Oceania,btohqsg
There are mutiple videos made on this topic and it is a contentious issue...,btohqsg
Huh? No what then is japan oceania,btohqsg
What even is the fucking definition of oceania,btohqsg
What include the entire Pacific ocean,btohqsg
Then Japan would be a part,btohqsg
That is not a fucking definition,btohqsg
Also it ain't even a universally accepted definition,btohqsg
I know for one the entire PRC will deny that fact,btohqsg
Heres a useful video on the issue,btohqsg
The Australia you have referenced is one of a four micro-continent,btohqsg
Give me a definition in which stands up,btohqsg
What in the geo is this,btohqsg
Idk this guy is trying to argue australia isn't a continent,btohqsg
This is why I said microcontinent,btohqsg
I’m not trying to say Australia is not a continent but I think you have a skewed understanding of Oceania,btohqsg
And I am saying oceania is not a continent because it violates the rules for a continent,btohqsg
Which is a contiguous large land mass,btohqsg
Alright  I see. I mean Britannica is really reliable but the sources I’ve shown came from the UN and NationalGeographic,btohqsg
I am confused as to your argument so would you like to debate as to the veracity of the sources now?,btohqsg
Yes I wanna gonna say the taiwan issue a whole new can of worms,btohqsg
Oh no the geography queen is here,btohqsg
how does poly works actually ah  Im Malaysian lol,btohqsg
I thought the only Geography royalty only goes to Imperial Zeng,btohqsg
You got option to do A’s or poly,btohqsg
What do you want to know about poly,btohqsg
can you take two panadol doses at once,btohqsg
Like the admission to poly or what to do after poly,btohqsg
oh how  the course structure works,btohqsg
is it like one college  that offers all bunch of weird modules and you mix and match?,btohqsg
or is something like Diploma in XYZ Engineering type of things?,btohqsg
Take an ibuprofen if u rlly need it,btohqsg
BUT sometimes we got similar modules,btohqsg
Some non business course has financial and accounting module,btohqsg
You guys got a engineering poly equivalent,btohqsg
ohh means  linked modules between courses? like bridging courses?,btohqsg
Every year 1 student in an engineering school learns the same thing,btohqsg
that's a private* college also no ones goes there,btohqsg
No it's like general modules so like communication is usually a mandatory one and critical thinking,btohqsg
Common modules for all courses and schools,btohqsg
For other schools and polys it's different but broadly if it's the same u can bet there is a common course for those,btohqsg
Like school of humanities ofc don’t have ah,btohqsg
our politeknik is something like an national exam as well. All the schools sit the same paper lol,btohqsg
I mean the kind of things you will be learning are around the same caliber,btohqsg
but then Malaysian Malays / Bumis only go Poly,btohqsg
all the minorities Chinese /  Indian hardly go in  mostly go private  or STPM aka (A-Level),btohqsg
Idk bro but I was under the impression that humanities is mostly reserved for Uni,btohqsg
Also got Tamil studies too if I remember,btohqsg
Do you guys think that a business or engineering diploma is more useful,btohqsg
Either ways can ignore that too tbh humanities is a niche area for polys,btohqsg
humanities in poly is more theoretical course apart from ECS(?),btohqsg
Na it's more work based so it's how u can apply it in work and office setting in jobs,btohqsg
But either ways tho idk why would u mention that it is a super niche area humanities in poly..,btohqsg
Humanities u wan go uni which is what I did,btohqsg
ohh what jobs can you get with humanities degree though,btohqsg
Government jobs thats why degree is necessary cuz its the bare minimum,btohqsg
philosophy  undergrad $7k in bank job,btohqsg
Philosophy is the lowest payed major according to GES,btohqsg
But then again it is also the smallest major in coHASS,btohqsg
if per year can jump off a cliff,btohqsg
i feel humans very sad sia the pay,btohqsg
Whats the highest paying humanities degree job,btohqsg
Yeah legit it's the lowest for all humanities majors,btohqsg
Rp also got special diploma other poly’s don’t have like we got two design diploma in two diff schools,btohqsg
Don't necessarily need to be those,btohqsg
But I wont warn them cos half of all the top scorers go humans if they went stem it would be a extremely conpetitive,btohqsg
The entire humanities major they all accept,btohqsg
I feel as if our society these days is too focus on STEM too,btohqsg
nope all the girls go humans and boys going to engi/stem,btohqsg
These two are under School of technology for the arts,btohqsg
many strings to be pulled that many don't know,btohqsg
I going fass because i cant do things i not interested in,btohqsg
Na bro it's like 60 40,btohqsg
what is the usual starting pay for uni grads now,btohqsg
like its lowkey amazing going for passion instead of pay. I admire them,btohqsg
20 years ago was 3.2k leh,btohqsg
Or u go see 75th percentile?,btohqsg
i mostly have an interest in humanities subjects but my parents be telling me that i cant earn money majoring in humanities and just told me to major in business or some shit,btohqsg
Same but instead its my cousins,btohqsg
that time DSTA offers near 3.8k,btohqsg
They say I waste my results to go fass instead of other majors like cs,btohqsg
Now for engi lowest paid is civil,btohqsg
Bruh rp courses adding a bit of everything,btohqsg
Na bro u made the right choice what's your major,btohqsg
Like they want ppl to do engineering and also business,btohqsg
ngl i feel not enough choices for uni,btohqsg
RP is always been about Work place integration,btohqsg
Have you seen their diplomas for continuity of education,btohqsg
wah seh my course is financial technology then not even a since business modulefucking misleading bs,btohqsg
Humanities and ss how to get 4.0 sia,btohqsg
Lampa u say that tells me a lot liao,btohqsg
just don't want show off only HAHA,btohqsg
U show me RPs catalogue for fuck limpeh in there for 2 years I know it in and out liao,btohqsg
What u trying to imply my dude,btohqsg
The GPA bar for that is higher,btohqsg
Lol too bad can’t find 6ps there lol,btohqsg
Idk I treat everyone online the same... horribly,btohqsg
i feel 4.0 is not enough,btohqsg
Sounds like you know where to find then goods,btohqsg
Its under “Humanities and sciences” i can choose from chemistry to philosophy to psychology,btohqsg
Apparently I’m like the 3rd batch of students in my diploma,btohqsg
Bro everyone knows it's a internal thing they don't share,btohqsg
NUS in 2050 become like SUTD,btohqsg
i think that's the free elective,btohqsg
or was that the common elective,btohqsg
U undeclared major the requirement higher,btohqsg
i did that like 5 times a day once,btohqsg
i wonder how i didn't die,btohqsg
sutd catching up to smu almost there alr,btohqsg
I think # means v v v less poly ppl so cnt take median or avg gpa as the igp,btohqsg
Na bro probably everything 1 intake liao woth the way they going,btohqsg
i love political science and philosophy broo,btohqsg
Abuden it's a fucking open secret at this point,btohqsg
Dont they have to cut places cos aging population,btohqsg
But i alr stated my pref major so is it like declaring,btohqsg
Na I suspect they cut also based on what the government needs for the future as well,btohqsg
at 3% annual inflation for 20 years  3.2k should be 5.8k now,btohqsg
That's why all kena engineering in NUS,btohqsg
your bio is so comedic LOL,btohqsg
Funny.. u expect wages to go up with inflation,btohqsg
Nsfw is one hand to fap,btohqsg
that was such a genius sentence,btohqsg
Have y’all seen the 2022 MOE report,btohqsg
It shows the acceptance rates of all poly’s,btohqsg
it doesn't. But property went up higher than inflationand govt says it is affordable,btohqsg
And how many ppl were accepted to each poly/jc etc,btohqsg
Talking bout that heard rp nearly closed idk if it’s true or not,btohqsg
But yea our intake numbers ain’t good,btohqsg
wait what is the intake numbers,btohqsg
Girl = guy in real life,btohqsg
i am a bomb about to hit your housebeware,btohqsg
I wanted to go thr sia,btohqsg
but hdb bto 5 rm from 325k till 600k wor,btohqsg
Stop intake during the year 202 smth,btohqsg
your gonna kill like my entire block,btohqsg
im kidding im not gonna do that to an innocent person,btohqsg
i’ll do that to the people who have messed with me before,btohqsg
my time nus have. I was thinking useless stuff,btohqsg
w8 where do pula ubin residents vote,btohqsg
there was also NUS - MIT I think,btohqsg
useless so no one goes mah,btohqsg
oh then what's the intake of other polys,btohqsg
what does a art major do for a job,btohqsg
Humanities has always been a loss making venture on paper,btohqsg
In total across all 5 polys the intake is around 66k,btohqsg
hope they don't get rejected from art school,btohqsg
biz degree not much use also,btohqsg
And doesn't happen to have a passion for Germany,btohqsg
u don't need a biz degree to start in biz but u need an engineering degree to start in engineering,btohqsg
Ngl his paintings are quite nice,btohqsg
BBA u need to be top 10%,btohqsg
then what for take biz degree,btohqsg
the art teacher said his paintings were ass,btohqsg
bro the art school said his paintings were architectural drawings that's why they rejected him twice,btohqsg
cos the shadows and stuff were messed up,btohqsg
Behold  beauty is in the eyes of the beholder,btohqsg
because newspaper say uni grads at least 4k+ mah,btohqsg
lots of engineers in banking also,btohqsg
U dont need finance specific degree to be a financial consultant,btohqsg
Uni acceptance across the YearsBold -total studentsLowest is 2020 2019…2018,btohqsg
I thought engi makes a lot,btohqsg
As quants and such things but the bank also needs dealmakers,btohqsg
This is sad bro. I make this at a warehouse,btohqsg
It is generally true unless u take civil,btohqsg
For reference elevator repairman like 4K,btohqsg
thats me w humans degree next time,btohqsg
my ex engineering colleague  became property agent rent out 1 house make 2k liao,btohqsg
Bro we are in the same boat,btohqsg
only need O lvl to be property agent,btohqsg
I will be in the yatch nearby 😮‍💨,btohqsg
Simi lj u take la good luck juggling a Engineering double degree,btohqsg
legit ??? like rayyan roulete and caydances,btohqsg
I never said my boat didn't have canons,btohqsg
and then proceed to get rejected from art school and start another world war,btohqsg
It did because I just realise how many ppl go jc,btohqsg
mine was 3.3k in 2008. But with 2 months AWS,btohqsg
U juggle 2 FASS majors still gonna be the same shit,btohqsg
To have Double degree u need contrasting major,btohqsg
turtle boi and caydances friend i think,btohqsg
One from fos one from fass,btohqsg
I quitted 4 yrs later after serving scholarship bond,btohqsg
U take life science end where,btohqsg
that time dsta starting pay is 3.8k,btohqsg
You guys know that every year roughly 12k ppl enter each poly but only 4K+ graduate at the end of their poly journey,btohqsg
Also u damn funny sia a stem major alone is enough on one's plate liao,btohqsg
That one might be skewed to RP,btohqsg
my friend take psych and chemistry,btohqsg
they should go jc  and come to me for lessons 😂,btohqsg
yea sia i can tell its rp,btohqsg
My biomed class half of them in my sem 1 class ain't there anymore.,btohqsg
AUs** SIT accepts the highest amount of Diploma holders,btohqsg
And in fact SIT mostly accepts Diploma holders,btohqsg
General rule of thumb is those 56% have above 3.0 GPA at least,btohqsg
i heard the 90 rps getting rejected from nus this year because their portfolio not that good as the 70 rps,btohqsg
i plan to dsa but later my grades drop in jc and i get more stressed HAHAHA,btohqsg
Arts so music performing stuff like those,btohqsg
I see many tuition centres do also  I can read in between liao,btohqsg
U don't even show us the whole table how to read.,btohqsg
Lanjiao the quality like JavAV like that,btohqsg
Why u show the 2021 one..,btohqsg
Why my one not so blur,btohqsg
There's the 2022 one out alr,btohqsg
Intake means actually go into the poly,btohqsg
Enrolment. Mean register for the poly,btohqsg
How much is braces in sg ah,btohqsg
Guys there are literally graphs to look at,btohqsg
Should be OK but you got insurance?,btohqsg
no wonder my parents don't want to give me braces even though the dentists were strongly encouraging me to get braces ☹️,btohqsg
Yeah it's expensive and painful af.. if its small enough the shift can just ignore,btohqsg
nah my teeth is actually very misalignedespecially the front,btohqsg
and it makes my smile look ugly af,btohqsg
Na I think it looks fabulous learn to love your speical features,btohqsg
The one y’all need to check is jc graduate to Uni enrollment,btohqsg
Most either retake Os or just go private,btohqsg
tough to track. Many good students go overseas too,btohqsg
Limpeh will also go even if it bankrupts me,btohqsg
can I get the link to this statistics?,btohqsg
lol pretty sure  Singapore Poly has more seats then Malaysia....,btohqsg
I feel like I have to say this again but yall looking at the 2021 one.. got 2022 out liao,btohqsg
Thats a your friend problem study until brain fried liao,btohqsg
Our universitys and colleges only accepts like 100-200 intake for Degrees.,btohqsg
Are you saying also your brain fried too?,btohqsg
then you multiply by 10x campuses lol,btohqsg
I got accepted to Cornell  then I no money and no scholarship to go 😂,btohqsg
ivy league is a waste of money depending on what you want,btohqsg
but then if you go private college / uni it is a whole other story,btohqsg
but thinking back  I think I done better staying at NUS,btohqsg
you still need to loan a ton to pay it off,btohqsg
for Engineering School wise  isn't NTU better?,btohqsg
If u got accepted they usually will loan you money for banks either that or credit unions too,btohqsg
doesn't matter  I see my NTU EE friends still not able to change their home lighting,btohqsg
NTU is the biggest Engineering college for a reason,btohqsg
U think NUS EE will have any different,btohqsg
"pretty sure they have one more ""E"" in electronics /heh/",btohqsg
I am nus EE and I fix the whole place,btohqsg
it's how it's appliedtheory centric or not isn't a big thing,btohqsg
i seen people in my uni still struggle with V=IR despite learning since Primary  Secondary  Pre-U... and University...,btohqsg
Idk liao that one.. maybe your sample size too small liao,btohqsg
Like it is no. 2 not ivy but considered ivy,btohqsg
definitely is. I was only comparing between the fch and 2nd uppers,btohqsg
Yeah Ivy equal la but still gotta be precise,btohqsg
I just don't like Uni  for EEE just throws you a bunch of Maxwell equations  and tell us good luck have fun. /heh/,btohqsg
Oxbridge only if u want business Econs,btohqsg
if too indepth theory  student loss  habis the semester lol,btohqsg
it's a lot of time management,btohqsg
Mainly TEM the S go somewhere tbh,btohqsg
hardest part in uni is managing your time I think,btohqsg
i just hated the Math Modules lol.,btohqsg
u will still do well with enough time,btohqsg
no matter how much u hate it,btohqsg
Go singapore need to hear you walao I rather get stabbed,btohqsg
by the 4th year  it was motivation issues for me,btohqsg
with the correct lecturer  I might  but I gotten some Physician who talk too indepth  and introduced many weird math symbols  im like im done for this semester.,btohqsg
S go John Hopkins or smth,btohqsg
no idea how i even managed to pass and scored a B in that module lel,btohqsg
didn't feel like studying in final yearIt's like I'm going to start earning $$ as a full time worker finally,btohqsg
Wah female teachers length of service longer than males sia,btohqsg
U see the 2 years for Bedok?,btohqsg
which other job allows many maternity leave and no pay leave and still let u have the job,btohqsg
did well in SPM  screwed up big time in A-Level International  then went to some lowest min requirement Private uni in malaysia doing EEE. hahaha,btohqsg
Oh yeah I met Jun Wei halfway in my A-levels haha,btohqsg
no la  just met online haha,btohqsg
you must see the STPM Maths and Physics passing and fail rate in Malaysia lol,btohqsg
i was at sgforums helping students,btohqsg
Good what means the bell curve in your favour,btohqsg
i laze what did he say😭,btohqsg
U go scroll to pass rate by race,btohqsg
i saw the % for psle o and a levels,btohqsg
I still remember my index number,btohqsg
ah yes  and no.   If you like plugging numbers into equations and less explainations STPM is more for those people.But then there is one stupid element in the exam - General Paper in B. Malaysia.If you flunk GP in Malaysia  you basically can't get your cert lol.,btohqsg
I think the failing rate for STEM course is like 50% lol,btohqsg
U think singapore any different? You fuck up GP here also cmi,btohqsg
today I visited my GP tuition teacher. She's 80 years old,btohqsg
bro they make us remember that shit,btohqsg
i still remember my o level index and center number too,btohqsg
lol atleast it is in English lol,btohqsg
Nice try bro I ain't gonna lose all my money..,btohqsg
Although tbf my account only got 5 bucks in it rn,btohqsg
for a Malaysian who struggled BM for 17 years. You tell me write 2 essays  20 MCQs + 5 structures questions in 2 hours. I might die lol,btohqsg
therefore  I jumped out for STPM  and paid RM 30k for A-Level College lol,btohqsg
I was like best index number,btohqsg
"Nope  the most ""Prestigious"" ""Religious"" College in KL.",btohqsg
claims to have the best track records and 2nd cheapest lol,btohqsg
i just like solving questions  in O-Level/A-level context  hence Im here lol,btohqsg
apparently this is a good bluff in scholarships interview lol,btohqsg
Na bro this chat is open to anyone tbh even Kuro is here,btohqsg
Good mah. Last time I help at sgforums. Now help back people,btohqsg
Singapore is just this is poly u wan join dw then dw lor,btohqsg
side rant  I feel Singapore Web Forums needs an update tho. Kinda not so user friendly hahaha.,btohqsg
but their track record was good until the management fucked up in my year lol,btohqsg
anyhow  most students who go for A-levels in Malaysia normally aim overseas.,btohqsg
Bruh what did they do lol?,btohqsg
hired bunch of replacement lecturers  that never taught A-Levels before lol,btohqsg
Isn't there a Bumiputra cap for Public Unis?,btohqsg
also therefore  another reason I was in A-Levels than STPM lol,btohqsg
thought I gotten 8As in SPM was a breeze  then saw A-Level International syllabus  and I said to myself  look at all those past year papers and publically available marking scheme,btohqsg
Ah but as a international student applicant its a disadvantage for AUs,btohqsg
Especially cuz International Alevels as well 💀,btohqsg
That and SMU SIT SUSS SUTD,btohqsg
well  my friend gotten 3A* (chem/phy/math) 1A in Further Maths got rejected to NUS/NTU lol,btohqsg
so yeah i can see why lol,btohqsg
Cuz its international Alevels as well,btohqsg
technically for Malaysians the easier route would be STPM/UEC into NTU/NUS,btohqsg
but then my tuition friends and I was tired of writing BM essays lol. We all scored like 7As-9As  and we said let's yolo together in A-level college.,btohqsg
rip good that it lasted more than 20 years lol,btohqsg
the issue is the cost not the loan. the value you get from those unis without a scholarship isn’t worth if you’re not intending to pursue further studies or work overseas,btohqsg
uni in the US is extremely expensive even for citizens,btohqsg
If u got into a Ivy most likely u alr choose to work overseas,btohqsg
Cuz the EV is higher there,btohqsg
i mean that’s based on the assumption you alr chose to do that,btohqsg
but that’s precisely why it’s not always worth,btohqsg
if i have a scholarship hell yea,btohqsg
and people can change their mind,btohqsg
Isn't that cuz he had to come back lol?,btohqsg
anyhow  apparently UK is very generous on giving offers placment to International Students  even my friend gotten a bunch of Cs managed to get a place in some rando UK uni,btohqsg
U go overseas not for the education but for the experience,btohqsg
And if it's the US the pond is bigger there,btohqsg
for US  no idea how widely accepted is A-levels is  but I think you need to do some add on SATs.,btohqsg
Don't think so most Ivy's are shifting to a Test Blind or Test Optional model,btohqsg
unless you're some child prodigy or have some big cable connection.,btohqsg
Pay is higher in the US tho gotta talk also about which majors,btohqsg
no idea how the 3 folks in Malaysia with International A-Levels gotten into Harvard recently,btohqsg
i just know one is an olymplaid maths winner,btohqsg
pond bigger but also big issues,btohqsg
i mean i’ve a ton of friends that are american citizens,btohqsg
In the US starting pay for Ivy would be 15-20k.,btohqsg
Plus going us is like smurfing,btohqsg
oh  Top in the World Certificates are normally quite common for International A-Levels lol,btohqsg
but not sufficient enough to lead them to Ivy leagues,btohqsg
nah that statistic is very mistaken,btohqsg
its not as bad as you think,btohqsg
There's always downsides but I don't see the point of being afraid of the downsides while not fully seeing the upsides of a bigger pond,btohqsg
no i just think you’re not really having a close look at the actual situation,btohqsg
We are tailored to look at the US and the world in a negative way cuz the news is always fucking negative,btohqsg
You have the freedom to choose your state/ suburbs city or rural,btohqsg
plus you can live in an asian comminity,btohqsg
you mean being gunned down or murdered?,btohqsg
one of my exes was literally from MIT and it’s a big struggle without a scholarship,btohqsg
Us got 300 million ppl hello,btohqsg
i mean not for me because i’ve enough experience personally with the US,btohqsg
1 person doesn't constitute a full view of the US,btohqsg
i’ve friends from like most states,btohqsg
i also have been to most of them,btohqsg
And those friends represent a fully sampled unbiased group?,btohqsg
i do too. Not a good source bruh,btohqsg
We all are that's what I am saying,btohqsg
im simply evaluating what’s worth and what’s not,btohqsg
Cuz we are build to do so,btohqsg
singapore has its plus and minuses,btohqsg
ohh  I'm not sure this sounds weird  talking to someone you just met.basically  I met a friend of friend  who went to study and graduated from the US.I bring up this topic  and she gotten weirded out or offended by this topic  and passed the message to my friend. lol,btohqsg
How much would you value your life?,btohqsg
If you got money us is good,btohqsg
^ yeah and go overseas for the experience,btohqsg
because I was in wow  a girl in her 16/17 went to US alone study  without her parents and go out often.no concerns about gun shootings  violence against asians lol.,btohqsg
like for my phd the reason i stayed in sg is because financially it made no sense to not,btohqsg
1 person is hardly a sample,btohqsg
i technically praised her  for her braveness lol,btohqsg
but somehow  she got offended or my friend got offended that I weirded out her friend lol,btohqsg
No like what is your value of your life? So much that u forgo the extra doubling in pay?,btohqsg
