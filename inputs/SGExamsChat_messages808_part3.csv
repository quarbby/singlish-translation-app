But omo i think they had to increase intake coz of the sudden cut down of 4 schs,btohqsg
Then maybe now they cut down intake slowly and that is why there was a year where yi was actually 19 not 20,btohqsg
Hi all any free resources and notes for studying h2 literature in english and h2 maths?,btohqsg
It took Apple 14 years to add a built in calculator into the iPad lol,btohqsg
Tbh there is no need for that for apple users given that they don't calculate anything... their very purchase of an apple product is in itself a bad financial decision,btohqsg
The new features are good sia,btohqsg
Then the answer will change automatically,btohqsg
I guess I made a bad financial decision since I’m stuck in the walled garden now,btohqsg
A walled garden u placed yourself into. Not gonna talk about if you knew of that when u did so just the fact that u did so.,btohqsg
It wasn’t really a choice at the start since my first smartphone was a 2nd hand iPhone from my parents long ago,btohqsg
I wanted to switch years back but realised a lot of stuff couldnt transfer over so I was like nvm,btohqsg
U shall bear the sins of your forefathers,btohqsg

Works in all places except NTU,btohqsg
No not nice. Try to navigate NS to SS they tell u walk on the route of the Red Loop,btohqsg
I love walking from ns to ss,btohqsg
I never actually walked leisurely for that route ever,btohqsg
It was always a rush to catch smth,btohqsg
I always walk that route when i walk back to hall from spms,btohqsg
I lazy so I just take the Red Loop Bus,btohqsg
And wait 30 mins for 1 cuz peak NTU efficency,btohqsg
I made that mistake in y1s1,btohqsg
The frequency of buses in NTU drives anyone insane,btohqsg
I mean walking would take 15-20 mins too,btohqsg
10 mins more because I am lazy seems like a good trade off,btohqsg
I finish CC5 liao so can just forget about that,btohqsg
But tbf i think it is the easiest cc mod,btohqsg
