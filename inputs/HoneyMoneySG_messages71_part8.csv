Anyone successfully book a flight thru DBS Expedia link recently? I've been having problem checking out  the page just keeps saying error,btohqsg
Have you compare the air ticket price quoted by Expedia vs ticket price quoted by other website such asTrip.comand airline website? Is the price the same?Which airline you plan to book?,btohqsg
Up to your valuation  I personally value it similarly to Chris at 1.25 cents per mile,btohqsg
"NormalExpedia.com.sgis working fine  the ticket price for Expedia dbs link is actually slightly cheaper and I get to earn 6 miles  but I keep getting an error message saying ""we weren't able to proceed with your booking""",btohqsg
Air Asia indonesia  but I tried selecting Singapore airlines and got the same error on checkout,btohqsg

Have you read the DBS-Expedia TnC? Air Asia Indonesia and Singapore Airlines are not the participating airlines  hence  you likely will not get the extra miles (6mpd) you want.,btohqsg

For cash rebate? I dont think so,btohqsg
but does it counts as $600 minimum spend?,btohqsg
If it does not count for rebate it dont count towards minimum spend.,btohqsg
My understanding of the T&C is that yes  it counts towards min spend (which i believe is 500 not 600),btohqsg
count to $500 min spend for uob one account bonus interest  but dun count to $600 min spend for rebate on uob evol,btohqsg
