"Seems like more and more dp of them fixing the ""bug""",btohqsg
Depends on the card. Check the t&c tl be sure. Example is DBS Live Fresh counts  UOB EVOL don't count.,btohqsg
lol   saying something without sources to back you up,btohqsg
Hmm I think it‚Äôs more like we don‚Äôt really know the exact criteria they take in. I would say it‚Äôs a risk but if one alrd have the account then why not,btohqsg
He‚Äôs a crypto bro  he‚Äôs traumatized by the word ‚Äúinterests‚Äù,btohqsg
Technically I wouldn‚Äôt call CF give you interest,btohqsg
Had it for some time already. Nerf takes effect from Aug. Mine was for last month. Purchase fromTrip.comwas $1.8k  surely fulfilled. Touchless also. But dunno why got less than $40...,btohqsg
Your transaction posted forTrip.comand $250 of contactless spend?,btohqsg
Guess this month will be last month for Evol,btohqsg
So your spend was in May statement month?,btohqsg

What does the t&c say? Is CardUp excluded?,btohqsg

How to find the Best Credit Card to use with Dobinhttps://youtu.be/Nkg_X7_hG6Y,btohqsg
"I made 2 overseas purchases with my Amaze card  but Global Blue couldn't process the tax refund to it. So I routed the refund to my Amex Ascend card. To my horror  Amex deducted miles + bonus miles for foreign spend for the refund amount  even though it wasn't the original payment method. Amex cs said it's their ""predefined process"" and ""can't be changed"". Anybody kena this before? Is this standard with other credit cards too?",btohqsg
Bros. I need help here.I would like to check.  For oversea amex marriott bonvy card  as us foreigners able to apply ?,btohqsg
Seems normal by logic. Their t&c did state that refunds will be excluded from miles rewards. Be it if it's the original payment methods or not.,btohqsg
Damn.. such an unfair practice since they didn't award those miles in the first place zzzz I went with Amex for refunds cos they don't incur DCC charges. What cards do you guys usually use for tax refunds that don't incur DCC charges?,btohqsg
Using a burner telegram account to conduct slander? Pretty low blow,btohqsg
Usually.... May not happen also üòÖ,btohqsg
So usually...... Flip a coin and find out?,btohqsg
Don't think need to flip a coin.. usually they will send letter stating GIRO is rearranged for you.,btohqsg
Always best to tax refund to debit card,btohqsg
Agree! But some  like Global Blue  don't process tax refunds to debit cards  only to credit cards or cash refunds (if their counters are open),btohqsg
Then take cash refund is your next best bet,btohqsg
Would have went that route.. but their counters were closed  so could only clear tax refund checks and submit the forms via their postbox,btohqsg
Which Global Blue took almost a month to process üòÖ,btohqsg
hello which credit card should i get if i want to spend on air ticket/overseas accoms and expenses  but am not confident of hitting any minimum spend in the long term?im open to both miles and cashback,btohqsg
I'm trying to consolidate a comparison for this actually but not ready yet hahahaBut as of now  I believe for air ticket  miles  you can look atthisIn general (flight and oversea expense)  you can probably take reference tothis,btohqsg
How is this compared to Heymax? :),btohqsg
Hi if i cancel the hsbc travel one card they will still charge me the annual feeÔºü,btohqsg
want to apply the card and redeem the singsaver gift ü•≤,btohqsg
As we are in honey money sg group  i would suggest contents from Chris first.,btohqsg
Chris has a video on this topichttps://youtu.be/Kkkg1o_eWvo,btohqsg
I have to add miles accumulation itself is a long term commitment.,btohqsg
did u get miles for the card u linked to amaze? or you used amaze wallet for payment?,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Oversea usage . Better to use citi rewards with Amaze card. Because it is so much useful for oversea.  Almost all can be use. Except travel.,btohqsg
right...then i guess cashback ccs will be more useful for me then,btohqsg
It's quite clear in the TnC that you need to pay annual fee.,btohqsg
Yes agree.. then have another back up for revoult oversea ATM withdrawl up to sgd 300,btohqsg
Yep. Consider any cards that you can get new to bank status. Spend and claim rewards.,btohqsg
No other choice. We want to avoid fx charges by bank impose on credit card. Best person to check with is ask Admin in here.,btohqsg
should actually pairAmaze + UOB Lady to tackle $2k on the big categories like Dining or Hotel or Groceries depending on what you pickTHENwhatever UOB Lady cannot take  then put onto Amaze + CRMC (don't waste the precious $1000 quota),btohqsg
Bro. This only applies to uob lady solitaire right. If the normal one I think is only cap at 1k ?,btohqsg
I think best person to check with is Admin. Cause later say wrong again. Get ban...,btohqsg
No one gets banned cuz saying wrong things. I got things wrong too üòû.,btohqsg
What is the mcc code for payment to SPF and SCDF for licenses?,btohqsg
