We are like spamming the grp here sia I thinküòÇ,btohqsg
pasal abang bomba tak save saye,btohqsg
no la but i wanna be one next time,btohqsg
K aku nak gi mampos guys,btohqsg
i‚Äôd rather be gay for ur bf,btohqsg
why is there so much food being posted here,btohqsg
let me starve myself in peace,btohqsg
i‚Äôve been sober for like a year alr :‚Äù,btohqsg
alright guys so i jst discussed with carros: though they are willing to host and allow the rooftop to be open for us theres a few concerns i and they have,btohqsg
1. the revving  burnouts and all that is a NOGO. if not  i kena held accountable la basically,btohqsg
they said all that for seah im also lol,btohqsg
2. if we set a limit for cars to come  and other ppl join the meet past limit,btohqsg
Just trust some stupid slow car to go and pop and bang and ruin the meet lor,btohqsg
3. building management dowan spotters to run ard chasingn cars to record and shit,btohqsg
4. pretty much common sense stuff la: dont drift and cost damage all ya,btohqsg
so if im gna continue with this meet then i will be setting it to a private one and ill only solely invite ppl i trust,btohqsg
U rlly think ppl gonna comply?,btohqsg
cfm will have 1 person wont comply,btohqsg
Almost all the meets i go to says no pops and bangs,btohqsg
Theres gonna be tat crowd whos like EH REV REV,btohqsg
Its almost impossible to make a car meet wif no revs n shit,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry just trust one huge YP crowd and blue card crowd come and encourage pop and rev and whatnot,btohqsg
If like die2 strict liddat idt anyone wld come,btohqsg
but i blue card eh üò≠,btohqsg
i mean those that proper i can invite la,btohqsg
Tats quite sad doe for some ppl who legit just wanna see cars,btohqsg
If ppl rev and pop then u go Key their car,btohqsg
simple example of what they dowan is: the kallang meet,btohqsg
A lot of them just go cus wow car make loud noise,btohqsg
They all just go with trend,btohqsg
might just make it private  and for the invite to the meet for spotters i see first,btohqsg
Some of dem are quite passionate abt cars doe and admit it. The sounds are related to what makes a car sexy too,btohqsg
Not saying that all yp are retarded,btohqsg
But there will always be ppl gate crashing,btohqsg
So how do U intend to host meet,btohqsg
Ive hosted a lot of bike rides,btohqsg
stupid ppl do stupid things at meet,btohqsg
thats why i discuss with yall first,btohqsg
All of dem slalu ade ppl cmg in uninvited,btohqsg
like the street addict meet lor,btohqsg
TLDR: i jst talked to carros representative abt having a meet thr,btohqsg
Unless u make like very private or whatever,btohqsg
say no rev all then at last have,btohqsg
oh someone would probably wld try to take over the meet,btohqsg
and then what did they say,btohqsg
now i talking abt what they dont want us to do AT ALL and the risks given,btohqsg
A meet w/o revs honestly kinda boring if u ask me ah,btohqsg
idt y‚Äôall should put at carros,btohqsg
