at least try to be funny bro,btohqsg
nothing considering the stuff you say here,btohqsg
I like trolls who are funny,btohqsg
Ya thatâ€™s why I k1 bah,btohqsg
But actually what branch of physics do you do,btohqsg
Even if dont meet can do bridging alr i think,btohqsg
So art stream can technically do the stem majors,btohqsg
So if someone takes full arts with h1 math they can do stem majors?,btohqsg
But if you wanna do a stem major,btohqsg
A glitch in the matrix I say,btohqsg
Why tf did u do arts stream,btohqsg
Iâ€™m asking a hypothetical question bro,btohqsg
Wait bro so how long is the bridging? Letâ€™s say I do arts in JC with h1 math for 2 years. If I wanna do computer science in Uni as major how long is the bridging and actual course?,btohqsg
chs is a bit like the US system where you enter the uni first then declare major later,btohqsg
what bridging you need depends on the course you want la,btohqsg
Ohh but total how long would u need to spend in NUS,btohqsg
comp sci is under sch of computing,btohqsg
10th percentile IGP is 78.75rp and ABB/B,btohqsg
how about you look it up yourself,btohqsg
and even if it was under chs,btohqsg
with so many 90rp ppl with the subj prereqs applying for nus cs,btohqsg
why tf would they choose someone from arts stream,btohqsg
tbh i think chs just fucks up a lot of humans side that usually had a lower cutoff,btohqsg
If I get 83.75 I wonder what are my chances,btohqsg
Also I still donâ€™t know whether business admin is better than chs,btohqsg
I think the pay is but idk if Iâ€™ll enjoy it as much,btohqsg
too many variables to know tbh,btohqsg
Bro my pay is 1 million dollars per hour ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
i DONT work for Kim Jong Un,btohqsg
Oh well if I fail to get in I can retake my H1,btohqsg
