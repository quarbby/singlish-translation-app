Anyways ej didn't even have alot of 90rp,btohqsg
It is a me problem but every yr this time  it reminds me of bad tm memories,btohqsg
Seems that the GP distinction or AB rate rose in most schs this year,btohqsg
Also I forgot if I sent this,btohqsg
But at least Iâ€™m quite sure from 2025 onwards there will be consistently at least 15% 70rp for your sch,btohqsg
Prolly predict based off prelims or smthðŸ’€,btohqsg
I think these were better than mine,btohqsg
Anyways idt ej had any 8 distinctions lol,btohqsg
Why o lvl show but a level they seem not to bother,btohqsg
I'm gonna try ask my Cher for geog but doubt she'll ever disclose LMAOOO,btohqsg
My sec sch got show for my batch,btohqsg
My mum told me moe give the schs the stats (?),btohqsg
Coz not possible for them to prepare in 1 morning,btohqsg
Me too sia but my batch only that 1 liner,btohqsg
For some reason tm is not good at h1 sci,btohqsg
RI did surprisingly well for h2 geog,btohqsg
I guess for ej last year itâ€™s just that the standard deviation fell since the overall results are still roughly the same. Like fewer ppl with very good results but also fewer with crappy results,btohqsg
My batch out of 61  there were only 3/4 As in prelims,btohqsg
My batch only had 3 8 distinctions ik of,btohqsg
I think Acjc this year had 1 8 distinctions and 1 9 distinctions,btohqsg
But also the ppl who like fail a levels will pull down the results a lot,btohqsg
but to be fair  the h1 classes is 1 arts and 2 fr CMEp hybrid,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s always that 1-2% with less than 50rp lol,btohqsg
Idm hearing him yap abt physics and I have no physics bg,btohqsg
And im not trying to talk bad  but people in the 2 CMEp classes  most do not study:-(,btohqsg
Not sure abt that 1 arts class taking H1 phy,btohqsg
The girls generally we all study one,btohqsg
Meanwhile i remembered how i was tied at 1st w a guy fr my class at 78,btohqsg
The lowest ik in ej so far is 55,btohqsg
Then i found a counting error,btohqsg
And i was so eggcited to find mr lim to change the marks,btohqsg
I heard that before  which class is that,btohqsg
Hmm I thought there would be at least one person in all schs who fail like 2H2s then 40rp is gone alr,btohqsg
1 class in S4 i think used that name for ig acct,btohqsg
Probably at most one h2 then,btohqsg
Even my year lowest was like,btohqsg
My class we say create ig ACC but got lazy as shit,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think that hci/ri would have a 100% 3H2+GP pass rate,btohqsg
Meanwhile someone in my class change password and solo use the class acct,btohqsg
Btw u know my class witnessed the mjc trophies being thrown to the bin,btohqsg
Is it like cos of the merger,btohqsg
But uk after merger  tm soccer not dominating liao:-(,btohqsg
I rmb girls got into semi finals,btohqsg
It was the guys that dominated last time,btohqsg
Then idk sth happened to shooting  they medaled!!!,btohqsg
I legit shocked when I heard,btohqsg
Cuz my sec sch had shooting then their PT was known to be like one of the most xiong,btohqsg
JC dun really hv PT for anything actually (even performing arts??),btohqsg
My sec sch band pt is crazy,btohqsg
For uni application does choice sequence matter,btohqsg
