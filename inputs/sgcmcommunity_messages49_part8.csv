Hi guys just hoping some advice on ceramic coatings pls- after coating i dont need to wax/polish anymore? Next time just go petrol station car wash can already?- if kena bird droppings i wash off can alr or need to apply touch up coating?- whats the diff between ceramic coating and diamond coating?Thanks in advance for all your advice!,btohqsg
1. Polish before Ceramic Coating. You will still have to maintain the car after the coating. I honestly hate petrol kiosk washing cos they dont wash properly plus their cloth is probably v contaminated will cause alotnof swirl marks. Preferrably wash at home or bring to a proper car wash that uses pH neutral soap.2. Kena birdshit just wash  dont wait too long. Birdshit can permanantly stain the car paint3. i have no idea... marketing gimmicks maybe???,btohqsg
Just imagine ceramic coating as a sacrifficial layer. It will eventually wear off as time pass,btohqsg
im very particular about small details like paint etc so i will always wash at home to ensure that outside car wash dont bring it swirl marks etc,btohqsg
I did my ceramic coating and weekly I just spray water and wipe it dry. That's all. I don't send to petrol station. As the cloth they use will cause scratches. I've a separate cloth for Rims and Body.As for bird shit. Have to remove it immediately. If not it will definitely leave a mark.Don't scratch to remove it. Usually I'll just place a tissue and pour water over it. Leave it for 5 mins and wipe it off. Comes off easily. And doesn't scratch the paint.Ceramic or diamond or whatever they call it. I suppose is a marketing gimmick. I'm no expert. So cannot really advise.,btohqsg
The diff coating (ceramic/diamond) refers to the finish and hardness.Common one is 9HThere’s also self healing coating in the market now adays. Not fool proof  only works for certain level of scratches,btohqsg
Nope but planning to. Diff mounts are due for a change,btohqsg
Only bird droppings need wipe immediately  so always keep a pack of ph neutral wet wipes haha,btohqsg
Graphene Nano CoatingCeramic is the past.,btohqsg
Have a bottle of QD in the car. Spray QD liberally and wipe off the droppings as soon as possible.,btohqsg
