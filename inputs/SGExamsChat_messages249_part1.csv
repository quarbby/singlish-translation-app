Hi  looking for advice on EAE specifically on business area. Any general tips and course related tips? 🚨🚨,btohqsg
Pretend that you began your own small business in secondary school,btohqsg
Just ensure that there’s no way that they can verify,btohqsg
My friend faked his own business of renting lockers in my school and got his EAE accepted by NP BA,btohqsg
Do not try if u r not a good liar,btohqsg
So how do i ensure that they wouldn’t be able to verify,btohqsg
Uhh just ask yourself ‘if there any way for them to check if I’m bullshitting’,btohqsg
It’s all about learning how to bs,btohqsg
Just invent a backstory that’s believable,btohqsg
Don’t say crap like ‘I made 5 digits through this business’,btohqsg
This kind of thing need bs meh,btohqsg
I run a side hustle/business on Carousell,btohqsg
thats legit enough  but ofc need proof,btohqsg
Gross. Do it for real  don't fake it. Don't recommend lying even if it gets you the result you want. The bigger picture issue with this is that eventually they will close down EAE because everyone lies to get in. Then we're back to admission only by grades.,btohqsg
Ye if your morals matter probably shouldn’t do that,btohqsg
ok la H1 econs not that bad,btohqsg
i suffering in like all the subjects bah,btohqsg
don't worry I never passed econs until a levels,btohqsg
(my raw not below 10) my sch dw accept 4h2 without raw 10 and below,btohqsg
what's the use of 4 H2 anw,btohqsg
you also have the freedom to downgrade your worse performing subject to h1 for the actual exams,btohqsg
I barely made it into an a level sch,btohqsg
4 H2 is like way beyond my league,btohqsg
Have u seen ppl abv 20 in Ur sch y1?,btohqsg
Whoops I forget the word age,btohqsg
She 18 grad from hnitec then one year take Os aka this year next year 20 when result out,btohqsg
