Quite a number I see and know are crazy and manipulative behind the scenes. It’s ok being friends with them but dating  will have a different side de. In front of other people  very nice very sweet but when it’s only them in the room  you wouldn’t wanna know at times,btohqsg
I feel marriage is personal & may not be the case behind closed doors.,btohqsg
And if you don’t understand viet  bonus points for them to talk shit about you in your face,btohqsg
Outsiders may see the happiness but maybe it’s different at home.,btohqsg
