Anyone knows for this do I need fresh funds in or I can participated with current funds inside my UOB One Account. Thank you!,btohqsg
So can I transfer out and back again?,btohqsg
No. Please go and read the T&Cs,btohqsg
it is based on incremental fresh fund minus day end fund on 30 sep,btohqsg
that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account and re-deposited (whetherpart or all of the amounts withdrawn) into the Account indicated in the Registration (as definedbelow) at any time during the Promotion Period.🥺,btohqsg
My One Account just started late week.,btohqsg
the incremented fund wil be locked for 4 months and rem ..ONLY 1 time per pax...irregardless how many UOB account u have..can only tag to one...,btohqsg
just pump in will do   coz the account is zero on 30 sep for all new acct mah,btohqsg

Hi experts  for the SCB sign up bonus for the prizes from 17-18 Nov  will using the digital card qualify for spending? Before the physical card arrive,btohqsg
u pump in how much? last week open ok mah..just fill up the xmas form can liao..,btohqsg
With intention to transfer $150K to other banks for FD.,btohqsg
can..then u just fill up and choose the 200k one..,btohqsg
fill up the 100k one is the most optimal,btohqsg
Not wise because one account is only 0.05% after 100k iirc,btohqsg
this can only occur after that 4 months lock/earmark period..haha,btohqsg
ya..that's why..no worth to have over 100k inside,btohqsg
That's why the rest above $100K I do FD with other banks better,btohqsg
yup..she right..if u wanna move another 150k..then u just go for the xmas promo for 100k,btohqsg
u are effective getting ard 2.9 percent for that extra 100k for the saving promo while u can get better rate of fixed deposit at 3.5 percent on the market now,btohqsg

Sorry what u meant for this sentence?,btohqsg
