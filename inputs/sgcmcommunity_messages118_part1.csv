The pie to cte and pie at entrance to pie at sims Dr  always jam at peak hours cos most drivers try to merge at the beginning  when there is a few km of road stretch ahead  sufficient to merge or cross to cte towards amk/city...aiyoh,btohqsg
One good practice I think would be for drivers on highways to avoid last lane where there's entrance  so that there is no jam that leads from eway entrance to the main roads especially the moumein road,btohqsg
One good practise would be just change lane early and prepare to exit if one needs to. Not rush all the way to cut queue then cut in at last minute.,btohqsg
"I agrees.Many times  there are people cutting in the last minute. Causing alot of total stopping.. hence  the long traffic jam.They like to play ""🐔 chicken""Hit me if you dare 😜",btohqsg
That is so lame. Who doesn’t know how to cut to front and cut in at last minute? We just don’t because we have etiquette. It almost always causes the outer lane to get blocked because they can’t go in so block the entire lane.,btohqsg
i see some people on PIE to enter CTE/SLE,btohqsg
cannot cut in they just stop there and try to  force way in,btohqsg
i highbeam a few alr. just refuse to queue up  and they alr know need queue de,btohqsg
