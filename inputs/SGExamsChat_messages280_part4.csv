Ive decided to not disturb u today,btohqsg
@iWannaHideinaHoletoday is your last day of exam  am I right?,btohqsg
I wish you all the best,btohqsg
After your exam  you can finally,btohqsg
Also does anyone know if nafa/ laselle is counted as a uni//post sec pathway,btohqsg
Hey guys is there BELLCURVE for Nlvls for 2021?,btohqsg
I think my year dont have also just study hard can liao,btohqsg
Means the grading system is standard ?,btohqsg
yea there's a straitstimes article on it 1 or 2 years back,btohqsg
but that's just bellcurve  there's still grade boundaries  that's why you have ppl scoring 80+ for e math and still getting only A2,btohqsg
they adjust the min scores required for each grade,btohqsg
So i think example.... grade 2 will be within a range of,btohqsg
70-79 for example instead of 70-74,btohqsg
So ur grade 1 is 80 onwards i think.,btohqsg
Tbh i think combined sci for N(A) lvls to get grade 1 u need score 85 or btr lah,btohqsg
If want grade 1 for math,btohqsg
It means that there’s no rule saying ‘only 25% of people can get B’ or ‘only 10% can get A’,btohqsg
U just need to do ur best,btohqsg
I hope there is no bell curve,btohqsg
Then why emath the A1 is 95 above,btohqsg
It's not a bellcurve but there's grade boundaries,btohqsg
And a pass is more than 50,btohqsg
Bellcurve is just a specific form of moderation,btohqsg
Ur assuming that this is true,btohqsg
As long u do well then yea ur fine,btohqsg
But there’s very little evidence to suggest that A1 is 95 and above,btohqsg
Other than ‘oh I counted my marks and I got 95 but A2’,btohqsg
Which is as unreliable as it comes,btohqsg
By right you calcuated your marks is inaccruate.,btohqsg
U also won’t know ur marks isn’t it,btohqsg
And anyway A and Emaths have some of the highest distinction rates nationally,btohqsg
To be fair math is quite easy to count because other ppl do the paper and release the answers,btohqsg
What is grade boundaries  is it not just bell curve b a different name,btohqsg
But there’s working marks and everything which can throw off ur estimates quite a bit,btohqsg
They will adjust the marks accordingly to the difficulty of the paper,btohqsg
The main difference is that you are not compared against ur peers,btohqsg
As long as u make u do well,btohqsg
Bell curve says ‘only 25% of students can get A’,btohqsg
Tbh just study   u study hard enough for it then like,btohqsg
No need to fight with elite schools,btohqsg
Grade boundaries says ‘everyone above this mark can get A’,btohqsg
To be honest the grading system is pretty uncertain,btohqsg
Even if they did explicitly say no bell curve grading,btohqsg
So this will look at the examiner report  previous exam statistics.,btohqsg
But there’s nothing u can do about it anyway,btohqsg
To decide on the grade boundaries.,btohqsg
All u can do is to do ur best,btohqsg
And we have like 1/2 of a school getting A,btohqsg
Yeah which is why it’s quite unlikely bell curve exists,btohqsg
As in  exists in Sg school system,btohqsg
