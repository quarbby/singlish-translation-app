Hi can I ask if I retake ss/geog and pure bio without tuition  is it possible to improve my grades to an A2,btohqsg
But you needa pay extra for those Cambridge doods,btohqsg
Somemore you need to take bio lab,btohqsg
old men do be charging $80 for a piece of paper,btohqsg
How you gonna get practice for that? I rather you move on,btohqsg
If you meant DAE  it's still possible even if English is E8,btohqsg
But you want to push to a2 for what,btohqsg
Is Ok if there's a change of syllabus this year there will be two choices I can make to retake paper,btohqsg
I heard this year math failing rate is very high..15% e8&f9,btohqsg
1 o level pass 99.8% sia.,btohqsg
They nvr say if math was included uk@alvinmath,btohqsg
Anyways  regardless of your results  we are all very much proud of you  O Level Kiddos!,btohqsg
Dont let some bits of ink from an expensive paper dictate your life. It should be you who dictate your life.,btohqsg
uh guys yk the form A if it says Iâ€™m eligible for some poly course but my pts is like no where near the courses they say Iâ€™m Eligible for,btohqsg
Yeah.. but uk  it will be difficult for you to get the course,btohqsg
All the courses they say Iâ€™m eligible for is like no where near the points I gotðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
but I mean if jae fails I can appeal to that courses right?,btohqsg
itâ€™s courses like architecture and interior design,btohqsg
I think u will surely get into one of the course,btohqsg
I feel so dumb I got 20ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Have you looked at the booklet and see what course are available with 20points?,btohqsg
Cuz with 20 still got q alot of courses,btohqsg
But itâ€™s 16 pts in tp,btohqsg
I mean you can try at rp,btohqsg
yeah but Iâ€™m restricted cause of emathðŸ’€,btohqsg
What course in particular in CIP?,btohqsg
Yeah but itâ€™s my third choice Iâ€™m gonna appeal if jae fails,btohqsg
Cuz if u apply jae cannot dae,btohqsg
no cause in the booklet they said after results is jae unsuccessful you can appeal directly to the poly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows abt EEE for rp,btohqsg
So I want to go to ri  but compared to nyjc it is kinda expensive  and I know ri is usually for those who wanna go overseas uni but I'm still not too sold on overseas uni again because  again  money,btohqsg
Like it's not that money is a problem area  it's just that it doesn't feel right spending so much just to go overseas even for the experience,btohqsg
But if I don't go overseas uni after attending ri then going to ri feels wasteful,btohqsg
What do you want to do in the future?,btohqsg
If you got a goal in mind you won't rly bother about the money,btohqsg
Should I go ri or nyjc,btohqsg
You can't choose btwn ri or nyjc?,btohqsg
If u got a course in mind go poly,btohqsg
But I want to go uni?,btohqsg
huh first time im hearing of this,btohqsg
But have you thought about the consequences if you cmi As?,btohqsg
i dont think theres a pressure to go overseas,btohqsg
OK yeah rereading that now looks dumb,btohqsg
Even going to IB doesn't feel like there was pressure to go overseas uni,btohqsg
ya i did IB also never really felt the pressure to go overseas,btohqsg
I don't think I'll cmi As?,btohqsg
even tho alot of my peers did,btohqsg
Then why would u think u would waste money then,btohqsg
i guess i just felt more comfortable staying local at the end,btohqsg
tbf if u can scoree well enough for o's to go ri,btohqsg
