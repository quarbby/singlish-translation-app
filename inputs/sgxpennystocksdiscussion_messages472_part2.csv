Special Edition July 15  2021The meme stocks had a pull back and has fallen from its high. In this release  let’s have a change of flavour and walked through an express memory lane of the Meme Journey.When the first spark happensIn January  the blockbuster stocks GameStop and BlackBerry came to life. Since then  the clock is ticking as the countdown to when the crash will happen is the ultimate question. It has been more than half a year  and the Meme stocks are still trading at elevated levels. In addition  there are newcomers such as Clover Health Investments and Newegg Commerce  which have added to the Reddit board.No sign of business turnover  but fever is hotIf any  there is no sign that these businesses have shown business transformation plans or even profits to justify the valuation. Take BlackBerry as an example; the company burnt huge cash in its latest quarter with a warning that the cybersecurity division is likely to hit the low end of its revenue guidance.Retail investors appear unconcern. While trading volume has come down from the peak seen in Feb  the average shares traded in AMC reached $13.1 billion in June. This is more than Apple’s $9.5 billion level or even Amazon’s $10.3 billion.The fading of the Covid-19 effect did not cause the adrenaline rush of trading to stop. Instead  some survey suggests that 58% of the day traders had plans to increase their trade volume. Thus  the “buy the dip” sentiment remains vital and alive for this sector.Like a horse driving a cart  the sudden price spikes attract new investors  and the further spike in volatility continued to attract another level of investors. Likewise  there is no short survey indicating that millions of people downloaded investing apps in late January.In Stonks We TrustThe new investors have given their gems a new name  Stonks. These investors or traders in the Reddit forum have pushed supersized gains in AMC and GameStop this year  and BlackBerry is a beneficiary in the background  although the prices moderate these few weeks.Robinhood is a prominent player in the investing platform world as it added 5.5 million funded accounts within the first quarter. Fidelity also stated that they had attracted 1.6 million new customers. Surprisingly  they are under 35 years of age  and it is all within the first quarter  which is a splendid jump of 223% compared to a year ago.Commission-free trade has provided greater access to investors and opened the floodgates of a new category of investors who may not have sizeable disposable income to invests.Rock on  Retail ArmyWhile ETF investing has gain momentum  single stock picking has also grown in strength. Its roaring back can be evident from the fact that retail trading accounts for about 24% of the equity volume  up 15% from 2019. Moreover  the trend gives birth to new YouTubers who take on new videos and stream stock analysis several hours a day.As big investors open their market to learn and develop more time tracking social sentiments  we could see possibly the next “Alpha” in the game. But  till then  Pika World is here to navigate the investing and trading journey.What’s on the menu today?Back to reality now! It is another critical data day.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims. We are expecting 360K  which is a moderation from 373K in the prior period.At the same time  the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for July is expected to ease to 28.0 from 30.7 in the prior period.At 9.30 pm  Uncle Powell will continue his testimonial before congress.It is July 15  Thursday  at 7.36 am in Singapore. To everyone on the road or working from home  Pika World wishes you a safe and fruitful investing journey.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be a great motivation.,btohqsg
