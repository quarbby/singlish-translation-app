Pay in the beginning of the CC billing cycle and check UOB app after 2/3 days to see if it falls under qualified minimum spend,btohqsg
Usually for fresh grad will need to wait ~3months so that banks can pull data for your cpf contribution.For cashback cards can start with those that have no min spending but they usually have lower cashback rates like SC Simply Cash  HSBC Advance  UOB absoluteFor miles usually got no min spending so try to go for those with higher rewards like HSBC Revo  Citi Rewards  DBS WWMC  UOB Lady (for ladies only),btohqsg

Hi Expects  does HSBC Revolution Card qualify ASA  Chan Brother  CTC  WTS Travel as Travel transaction?,btohqsg
If I were you  I need to decide between a miles or cashback card first. My key considerations are: 1)No pressure to spend  2) the miles can keep long long or higher cashback rate. 3) Can pair with Amaze for foreign currency spending.Miles: I would choose Citi Premiermiles Mastercard or OCBC 90n MastercardCashback : Citi Rewards Mastercard or SCB Simply Cash Mastercard++ Instarem Amaze to pair with any of the cards above for foreign currency spend.,btohqsg
Morning all! I‚Äôm heading for Cruise at Royal Carribean soon! I understand that the spending onboard is USD-denominated! Can I check which Cashback or Miles credit card is the  best for this trip?? üòäDo seek all the help from the experts here!,btohqsg
Wow! Enjoy your cruise. Assume u want to focus your energy on other matters and not be bothered about card applications. May be u share the  cards u have broadly ?,btohqsg
Hmmm sure!I have the following:- HSBC Revo- Citi Cashback+- Citi Rewards- UOB Absolute CB- UOB EVOL- SC Smart- Amaze (For CRMC),btohqsg
Would let the folks advise. As I never go cruise before  I dun know the MCC code of the merchants onboard. If all MCC code are travel related  then no Cashback le.,btohqsg
Yups ideally would want to use CRMC + Amaze but not sure about the MCC (if it‚Äôs under Travel)Seeking guidance from anyone (: please chime in to help me out!,btohqsg
should be mcc 4411  excluded travel spend,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  really helps a lot. Just to check for those stated online for some of the merchant eg. ASA. Do I use Kris+ app to pay to qualify as online transaction?,btohqsg
Need someone who have been onboard to advise. I never buy anything inflight before.Btw  do u happen to have Trust Bank Visa?,btohqsg
roughly how much u spending  there are quite good overseaa spend promos ongoing but some need min sum,btohqsg
Oh yes I do have the debit card too!,btohqsg
Hmm I don‚Äôt think we are going to spend a lot  just some ad-hoc spends on activities that we are interested in :)),btohqsg
No. Visit their branches/outlets to scan. Call them to check first before visiting their branches.Also can check with them if Kris+ cash voucher can help you save additional $$.,btohqsg
Nice! If u don't want to have the pressure to spend  u don't know what MCC the merchants onboard would use  etc etc  u can convert your Debit card to credit card by completing the  Singpass MyInfo verification of income. Approval is near real time.If I were u  I would use this approach and switch my Trust Bank card pairing to my Trust Bank credit card account and use the Trust Bank card on board or at the end of the trip to settle bills.,btohqsg
think can go for the Amaze 4x instapoints promo if spend from Amaze wallet by 31 May  no fx fee. 4x instapoints equivalent to 4% rebate but need 2000 instapoints to redeem cashback. Topup Amaze wallet before the spend. Usually no rewards for the topup itself.https://www.instarem.com/blog/terms-and-conditions/instarem-amaze-wallet-may-4x-instapoints-wallet-2023-promo/,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Do u happen to know whether excess money loaded onto the Amaze walletfrom a debit cardcan be transferred back to a bank account or via  GrabPay back to bank account?,btohqsg
Yes if it is mobile contactless transactions :),btohqsg
What is the best cc to pair withparking.sgapp,btohqsg
What is yourparking.sgspend per month? If below $50  don't really matters in the grand scheme of things.,btohqsg
I dont use it often. But can it be paired with uob amex or boc sheng siong card?,btohqsg
Anything u like man. For me  theparking.sgapp is installed on my wife phone. She charge it to her dbs woman card just to meet the Multiplier's credit card usage criterion.,btohqsg
I see. Let me try the amex first. If it doesnt work  then i got to check the respective master/visa card's exclusion,btohqsg
I won't bother to check if my usage is not often. I would conserve my energy for other matters.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the inputs! It seems that the top options for onboard cruise spending are1. Trust Bank Credit Card2. Amaze Wallet (With the current promotion of 4% Cashback)Do seek other peeps' opinion if there are still better cards potentially out there üòÑ,btohqsg
does citi premier miles card charges annual fee?,btohqsg
Yes of cos :) to keep office air con and lights on and staff paid. However  u can submit for fees waiver subject to bank approval. I told the card for close to 8 years and manage to waive fees.,btohqsg
R u using M1 Corporate Individual scheme? Or u r the ËÄÅÊùø paying for your company bill?,btohqsg
I not ËÄÅÊùø. Try my best to answer üòäBut the MCC code is under telco. If u paid manually  is an online transaction. If u pay as recurring bill  I am not sure whether is considered as online transaction. Folks here might be able to advise better.,btohqsg
Thank you AG-sensei. I used DBS Women's World card to pay. Will see if it's reflected a not. =),btohqsg

"Any ""Honey Money"" tele grp with Chris' face as the grp icon is fake  pls report",btohqsg
I visited overseas hospital A&E previously. Used SC SimplyCash card  got my cashback - 1.5%,btohqsg
lol  customer service not trained. No point to ask the bank about this  only risk it being blocked.,btohqsg
