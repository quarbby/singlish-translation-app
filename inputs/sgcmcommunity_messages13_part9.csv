You go electric  increase demand for electricity. How will people make electricity? Burn more fossil fuels. Just shifts the blame,btohqsg
1. Alternative source of energy to power our powergrid2. Better batteries that is more environmentally friendly3. High speed limit,btohqsg
NO. that is not the point. the point is you DO NOT burn in cities where people live.,btohqsg
We should adjust the matrix perimeters,btohqsg
We just burn them in some island üëç,btohqsg
we all breathe the same air though haha,btohqsg
you have to look at the most pressing problems first,btohqsg
ask uncle elon burn in mars,btohqsg
Erm‚Ä¶ I am not so advanced and clever like Mr Arnav and some of you. I just worry about how I even charge my car battery when there are so few chargers and people don‚Äôt charge responsibly.,btohqsg
We breathe the same air? You will just shift the pollution elsewhere then melt glacier because of global warming. Later no city for you to live in  how?,btohqsg
you will get more charging stations,btohqsg
Seen many tesla owners complaining about charging. Wonder what will happen next.,btohqsg
i fllw jeff go space PHEWWWWW,btohqsg
All due respect  that‚Äôs pushing the problem to someone else sir.,btohqsg
ah yes so burning somewhere else (which eventually will lead back to places which people live) will solve the problem,btohqsg
there are problems in this world you cannot solve all. the idea is to limit it,btohqsg
Which tax structure or commercial provider pays for this?,btohqsg
i dont want to know all these.,btohqsg
thats like saying executing many people in another location will not affect the population,btohqsg
Even Tesla has started charging for the use of their chargers I believe?,btohqsg
"I think that's not the main issues. Island are homed to "" cities "" where animals live as well. We need to practice equality regardless or language   race   religion and even human or animals.",btohqsg
dark analogy but yes this is what ur implying?,btohqsg
With all due respect sir  you are not solving the problem at all then  just following trend like blind sheep,btohqsg
just like today  power stations are located far away in remote locations.,btohqsg
Sadly the powerstation burning can be smelled at times. I can smell msia from my place from time to time,btohqsg
that is a silly thing to say. how do you solve problems? if you keep saying yeah need more fuelk to burn to ma kme batteries. then what should you do? to solve citiees pol;utions? stop becming idealists. because it is easy to say,btohqsg
aiyo no need angry leh haha,btohqsg
The only way to limit is to reduce human life or overall consumption of resources period. You cannot just shift consumption from one place to another and say you are limiting already.Either need Innovation for better and more efficient sourcesOrNeed to reduce consumption in general which would require all to start walking to work  etc.,btohqsg
the fumes and smog come from factory right?,btohqsg
you should work for the green agency giving your brilliantr ideas and suggestions,btohqsg
Which is produced by factories off shore correct?,btohqsg
it does my guy... very badly in fact...,btohqsg
you do not reduce populations in  order to solve carbon emissions. the world alreay has reduced populations,btohqsg
yeah ill just answer for you  fumes and smog do come from batteries :),btohqsg
you dont tell agencies to solve carbon emissions by reudicng populations.,btohqsg
Have a reference? I can go apply?,btohqsg
and you worry about production of batteries.,btohqsg
lots of them. they would want your ideas,btohqsg
but nobody said reduce populations sir,btohqsg
Come to think of it what u are saying I completely agree. ü§î,btohqsg
wow thats heartless! thankfully you know they dont do it...,btohqsg
But government encouraging us to have more kids ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a good thing,btohqsg
you attack a problem by not worryng what the consequences would be. it is like many oil drillers say  oh what if one day oil runs out. but then these people are over worrying.  why? because oil is continuously being discovered,btohqsg
we have all kinds of theories. peak oil worry this that,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs kinda like‚Ä¶ limited?,btohqsg
but their fear is an actual possibility eh?,btohqsg
okay i agree you are fully correct sir!,btohqsg
Does Mazda have EV so far?,btohqsg
Mr X  you have enlightened me today. Solve the symptoms and root causes can leave to the government. I am thankful and grateful for your insights.,btohqsg
Tried the new 2/3 series at showroom,btohqsg
