Funny hor they rather not pay cancellation than pay 2 ppl to do the same amount of work,btohqsg
I had a shock when I saw Regular <3 this morning. I thought I became 80 years old ðŸ˜›,btohqsg
If they cancelled  I think they need to pay something like 50% to LLM or me for doing nothing.I dunno how the math works though. Can do the job? Just do lorâ€¦.If physically impossible  then I wonâ€™t insist. Those were birdsâ€™ nest - if I dropped it while riding  good luck to me!,btohqsg
Howâ€™s regular btw? Never tried before,btohqsg
LLM still haven't fixed the filter?! WTF!,btohqsg
Most engines  that arenâ€™t race spec would be fine with RON 92.Occasionally (once a month or two months?) use 95 to clean up the insides of the cylinders too.Today I got a bonus of RON97 in Malaysia though,btohqsg
55 vehicles turned back as fuel tank not 3/4 full at S'pore-M'sia land checkpoints -Mothership.SG- News from Singapore  Asia and around the worldhttps://mothership.sg/2022/04/three-quarter-tank-rule/,btohqsg
Want to go but scared kena turn back hahaha,btohqsg
If I go I take bus,btohqsg
getting through customs was quite smooth! just did that on bike today.within 15 minutes should get through each side  with time to spare.,btohqsg
Half tank hearsay the close 1 eye,btohqsg
hi can anyone help to locate this driver.probably a Lalamove driver?a hit and run happened this morning. thank you :),btohqsg
U all go around Singapore or stay one region take and go then wait new order again,btohqsg
Cheapo. Hoping car come take. Cos alot of orders obviously bike cannot take or they will order bike but write want car  then car drivers will still go take even though its bike price. Cos alot of drivers need to make money,btohqsg
So the vendors know liao  so they will just keep ordering bike even though its alot of stuff to deliver,btohqsg
Supposedly the person arranging didnâ€™t take note.I donâ€™t believe lor. The physical item is at their workplace  how not to knowâ€¦,btohqsg
If got pple come take then ok liao. Then anytg happen they will blame delivery pple nvr take proper care n then we have to take responsibility,btohqsg
Most of the time llm will side with the vendors cos they r the customers. Biz is from them. N so many delivery drivers/riders,btohqsg
Recently i jus accept a bike jobs as is  not far away. To my surprise after waiting for 1 hours. It consist of around 30 bowl or noodle n soup.,btohqsg
Yes correct. They purposely 1 and hope car will accept the jobs.  Some user more worse. Once they request bike and bike accept the jobs. They cancel n post again.,btohqsg
Now that you mentioned it; there was one job that I accepted - only to see it gone from my Ongoing queueâ€¦ and found it in Cancelled.Funny thing was  IIRC  the job reappeared and I accepted again - and got cancelled again.This was almost two weeks ago so I might have remembered some parts wrong.But yes  Iâ€™m on a motorbike.,btohqsg
Actually bike have more high demand than cars. I used it sometimes and could see cars are cheaper than bike.,btohqsg

Cars jobs almost no high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Some loan shark book to come here collect money lor,btohqsg
Panda also get a lot of this. The loan sharks target platforms that allow untraceable cash jobs.,btohqsg
Lalamove cheaper loan shark runner In sg,btohqsg
It's free. Calling the police is a bonus for them... just adds to the harassment.,btohqsg
Everyday police at the door taking statements... all the neighbours looking. Pretty much doing what the loanshark intended: name and shame.,btohqsg
At least the police getting paid to work. We get nothing  lose out on petrol  parking  time and energy.,btohqsg
Anti cash job unless is food,btohqsg
Just finish statement now continue wait for job,btohqsg
Waiting to see which person rig gauge and caught red-handed,btohqsg
Sure a lot of check la... Gahmen want you buy exp oil in sg,btohqsg

For those cash order... Rem to call log. Else if kana scam and no call log  LLM will reject yr compensation,btohqsg
Hard to void one. Ah long got so many number... They kana block by LLM they create another account. Just on yr luck only,btohqsg
Ok lah. But hassle parking with fees  your nett income only how much,btohqsg
