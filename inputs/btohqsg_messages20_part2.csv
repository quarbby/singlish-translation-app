No fixed number so it's very hard to say. Generally at the start of selection period there will be very few per day  then over time it will scale up,btohqsg
Could go from 2 per day to sth like 8-14,btohqsg
You can check out BTO appointment tracker  the owner  SM  tracks past projects where possible (if ppl submit data),btohqsg
Tks for your info! Much appreciated..ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
