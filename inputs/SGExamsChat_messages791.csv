I think one day we go out and will come back liquid,btohqsg
I will get a headache when there is sun,btohqsg
back in sec school i was media club..my seniors would tell me the spotlights we had would melt makeup of performers on stage..hence why out of 8 lights we had  the decision was made to cut the wires to 4 of them,btohqsg
also happy mother's day if somehow there are any mothers here,btohqsg
4 on each sides  2 of the spotlights on both sides were cut,btohqsg
I tell u how many times get a bottle,btohqsg
I am lucky to have permission to blow aircon,btohqsg
Sometimes blow aircon also the whole afternoon,btohqsg
basically the media head in my sec school decided to cut the wires without permission from the principal to cut the wires of 2 of the spotlights,btohqsg
But electricity bill is crazy too,btohqsg
so when a performance happened.. the other 4 spotlights would never work,btohqsg

its like just far away i can see my laziness taking over,btohqsg
u can be lazy when u go NS,btohqsg
i need to finish this torment first,btohqsg
it's not a torment if u see a reason,btohqsg
in other words  you need to set a goal. You need to know what you want to study in uni which stems from what you think you want to work as,btohqsg
without the goal  it's always a torment,btohqsg
i do alrdy have a goal,btohqsg
doesnt make it less annoying maybe,btohqsg
you dont rise to your aspirations  you fall to the levels of your systen kinda,btohqsg
means you don't really want the goal enough,btohqsg
its still quite vague for me idk,btohqsg
eg goal to be a full time mattress tester,btohqsg
ok this is just for fun,btohqsg
and it's normal to change it along the way,btohqsg
Easy to fall into laziness because there's always high inertia.And with inertia  it's hard to start moving (Newton's 1st law),btohqsg
eh post what is inside here leh,btohqsg
so you need to find somewhere to exert a resultant force on you so that you start accelerating and moving (Newton's 2nd law)And once you start the move  you will continue moving (Newton's 1st law),btohqsg
i wish they will bring back the 2015 voucher booklet,btohqsg

Someone pls repeat 9th SAF Core Value plsDon't get caught.,btohqsg
Something fun I learnt: that's two offences right there,btohqsg
I thought it'd be just one  turns out always minimum chargeable for two,btohqsg
one is driving w/o licence  what's the other?,btohqsg
When they charge in court  driving without license is always bundled together with driving without insurance,btohqsg
Reminds me of a old court joke. So a lawyer insures his cigars  a comprehensive insurance covering among other things  fire damage. Months go by  he submits a claim for his insured cigars claiming that it was lost in a series of small controlled fires.The insurance company refuses and rejects the claim arguing that clearly the lawyer had smoked them.The lawyer sues the insurance company for recovery as fire damage is listed as an insured event for his cigars.He goes to court and wins the case so the insurance company pays off the lawyer  the insurance company also has him arrested for Arson.,btohqsg
Yes you can drive without a license  whether it's legal or not is another qns,btohqsg

One day mbs also going to be replaced,btohqsg
bro i haven't taken a C751B in forever,btohqsg
YA HOR WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I TOOK ONE,btohqsg
Are there any unrefurbished c151 or c651 trains left,btohqsg
Tbh I wonder how train enthus get all these figures,btohqsg
C651 was never refurbished successfully in the first place,btohqsg
the 2 that were refurbished got scrapped after testing,btohqsg
oh ya i forgot abt the c651 refurbishment,btohqsg
the refurbished ones kinda sucked anyways,btohqsg
When was the last c151 refurbished?,btohqsg
the new rail financing framework thing,btohqsg
There was a unsolvable fault after refurbishment was completed so all refurbished carraiges were sent to scrapped,btohqsg
NRFF  New Rail Financing idk last F,btohqsg
due to THIS  LTA bought 106 R151s to replace 66 C151s  19 C651s  21 C751Bs,btohqsg
U REP KHI SAY WHAT IS C151,btohqsg
Was that why the remaining C651s haven’t been refurbished?,btohqsg
what the fault is we don't rly know,btohqsg
basically kinda like an audit to see the feasibility of the currently running trains  whether they can run for longer (operating  maintenance cost etc so on) or was it a better deal to scrap them all and get new trains,btohqsg
used to be only 66 R151s to replace 66 C151s,btohqsg
c651 I go in it’s a bit scary honestly,btohqsg
but they extended to 106 R151s to replace the q old C651 (which has q a lot of design inspirations/copied from C151) and the problematic C751Bs,btohqsg
problematic since they had gearbox problems since debut,btohqsg
i heard from my friend  who worked  or probably interned in TWD,btohqsg
C651s were the best rolling stock in terms of reliability,btohqsg
erm u friend might also be me,btohqsg
If one breaks down pretty sure the rest would be affected  and most of the breakdowns seem to be caused by signal issues and not one particular train giving issues,btohqsg
only 2 of them were refurbished,btohqsg
and same shitty ass staris 2.0,btohqsg
Means u are a student Si Yan u not old,btohqsg
So no one can call us old,btohqsg

but no point applying for poly eae if you aiming Jc,btohqsg
Once U accept eae offer you CANNOT go to jc,btohqsg
Cuz U can't even do JAE or what,btohqsg
I mean was the reason why the remaining 5 weren’t refurbished because the refurbishment for the 2 trains failed?,btohqsg
Funny people that take the transcab would have better off taking the merc,btohqsg
dont go poly if you’re unsure what you wanna do in Uni/future,btohqsg
if you have a portfolio for EAE why would you aim for jc,btohqsg
just math and sci in general,btohqsg
if i go poly i feel like i wld just slack,btohqsg
if you would slack in poly,btohqsg
if you fail jc you can still go poly :),btohqsg
ik my best wld be able to go jc and if i go poly i just feel like i didnt do my best ig?,btohqsg
also abit of my parents influencing me,btohqsg
Just do what U urself think is best,btohqsg
yeah your parents shouldn’t control you,btohqsg
Then imo best bet would legit be jc,btohqsg
they shouldnt have any factor in your decision though,btohqsg
Say until is so ez but,btohqsg

i fought my parents for a year until i could go poly LOL,btohqsg
