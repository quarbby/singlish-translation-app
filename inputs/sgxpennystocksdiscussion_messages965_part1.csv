September has been known to be a slow month but expectation that the Fed will start easing policy has fuelled a rebound in the equity market.Past tonight’s Fed meeting investors may start paying greater attention to US elections in November and market volatility may resurface. However  investors should remain invested ashistory showsthat equity markets tend to do well after the Fed embarks on rate cuts  provided a recession is averted and the US economy enjoys a soft landing.,btohqsg

Crude Oily 🛢️ WTI cheOng ki >71USD/ Bbl after thrown dn 👇 near 65 marking the second consecutive session of gains  driven by supply concerns? Remnants of Hurricane🌀 Francine continue to impact activity  with more than 12% of crude production and 16% of natural gas output in the US Gulf of Mexico still offline as of Monday. Additionally  there are signs of declining supply from Libya  with a significant drop in recent oil exports. Oil prices were also supported by increasing expectations of a larger 50-basis-point rate cut by the US central bank  which could boost economic activity and  in turn  lift oil demand.,btohqsg
