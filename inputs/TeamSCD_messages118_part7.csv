trial and error is best haha,btohqsg
but no time go for best,btohqsg
the friend that chose softer springs is using kw,btohqsg
if lowered  too soft will bottom out easier?,btohqsg
Actually I don't know the difference between coilovers  suspension and lowering springI just wanna lower my body without spending too much on itSomeone care to explain?,btohqsg
Depends on how hard they are entering the corner also,btohqsg
to me its the same thing but i could be wrong  but stock wasn't designed to go low.  So when you change to lowering springs its as if your forever putting load on it,btohqsg
I heard one of my friend saying if i install coilovers and do PHVGG TO MY RATINGSBECAUSE THEY WILL JUMP LIKE CRAZY BEHIDE,btohqsg
lowering springs = lesser allowable travel than stock springs so it has to be harder,btohqsg
it will give more load to ur absorbers thats why ppl say absorbers v fast uplorry (shd have some truth to this la),btohqsg
coilovers is a system of 2 parts (absorbers + springs) shorter springs also but the absorbers also stronger hence can tahan the extra load,btohqsg
I heard some ppl say rear more comfortable den stock,btohqsg
All depends on damping and spring rate of the coilover,btohqsg
engine mounts also can affect the comfort,btohqsg
cheapest initial cost is find 2nd hand spring for ur car model. springs can last pretty much forever,btohqsg
is it same as what they call suspension bushings?,btohqsg
my car v hard when gg over humps zz like quality cui lol,btohqsg
end of the day is see how u want to zheng your ride,btohqsg
those want race car  everything is stiff,btohqsg
Means if i wanna get it loweredIt's best to get coilover which is like a suspension plus lowering spring?,btohqsg
very simple... go servicing then its leaking,btohqsg
so use this chance to upgrade,btohqsg
when ask why don't go back stock  say if so fast leak  later same thing happen,btohqsg
sometimes i think i should have gone into sales,btohqsg
but you want a daily ride,btohqsg
yeah their road got more road noise,btohqsg
how does engine mount affect pull ah?,btohqsg
its like full suspension bike to hard tail bike,btohqsg
Say for safety. Stock when cornering whole body roll. With coilover is safer. xP,btohqsg
hmm i see. maybe reduce mechanical loss abit.,btohqsg
looks like going to be replaced rim,btohqsg
Probably no name from AL tyres,btohqsg
heh me use rep too hahaha,btohqsg
Idk how he still driving sia,btohqsg

But actually why cannot put spacer  why will fail inspection?,btohqsg
i tink only if wider den car body will fail,btohqsg
as long as got spacer is fail,btohqsg
short girl  tall girl  one use platform the other flats.  Which one can walk better,btohqsg
spacer also got ex and cheap ones,btohqsg
But lta logic why is it illegal?,btohqsg
lta just want less problems on the road,btohqsg
cos your wheel bolts is fixed length,btohqsg
when you got spacer  your reduced the amount of threads going into your nut,btohqsg
U want the offset get the rims,btohqsg
Not just about legal but for your own safety,btohqsg
@ishengjieever say he wash car the bolts loose can take out by hand,btohqsg
but daily drive is okay one ba,btohqsg
For many ppl it is cost,btohqsg
