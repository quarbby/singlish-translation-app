Referring to cpf shielding product for that few days,btohqsg
Does anyone knows the uob one account new account opening every friday promo first 100 customer  does it run out very fast?,btohqsg
Would like to check does recurring starhub bills work for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
One of the more stable funds approved by cpf sa. Shielding requires using a fund where u don’t want the price to move up or down too much.Since mmfs are not cpf sa approved  this short term bond fund is the closest.,btohqsg
How long is the shielding period? So funds will be redeemed and moved back to SA once RA is formed.,btohqsg
What happens to the interest monies for a Maxed out Medisave account on Dec 31?1. On Dec 31  the interest monies in MA to flow into SA as MA is maxed out.2. On Dec 31  the interest monies in MA will stay in MA as 1st Jan MA limit is increase.,btohqsg
I’ll give it 1-2 weeks after RA is formed before selling the bond fund.,btohqsg
Eventually the result is (1).Can refer to this video  and I'll do a 2023 update when the news is outhttps://youtu.be/zj4pW_VeKpw?si=XD2F7U5-jpX7_y1s&t=244,btohqsg
#dpopened at 12am on that day. approved the next day; saturdsy at 3pm lol,btohqsg
Did you get the cash for being the first 100 customer to open the account too?,btohqsg
SG t-bill currently almost 4% plus upfront coupon  can beat all those unit trusts. Looks like on par with SA 4%. Why use unit trusts for shielding? I can only think of holding period difference.,btohqsg
If u are not using ocbc u have to go down in person to buy tbills using cpf sa.,btohqsg
Don’t not touch CPF SA! I mean you can but only when the yield is high like 5-6% not now!,btohqsg
You will be losing 1-2 months of interest buying Tbill not worth it now,btohqsg
How does it work. Must time it? Or don’t withdraw to CPF account on maturity?,btohqsg
The context is for shielding. Not daily.,btohqsg
Only if you are 54 years old…View this video.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/36838,btohqsg
Probably won’t apply to me since Im not drawing CPF and unlikely to every hit FRS,btohqsg
I’m ahead of CPF board. They don’t let me do shielding nvm I’m intending to give up my passport and withdraw all my CPF. See what they want to say now. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
What is the reason not allowed shielding?,btohqsg
Watch the video loh. CPF scared the boomers go shield until lose money then kpkb CPF board,btohqsg
Even bid Tbill not guaranteed get full allotment unless you lowball and if get a freak yield also will lose interest. There is always a risk,btohqsg
Don’t want risk just do nothing,btohqsg
Where's the next destination after giving up your passport?,btohqsg
🥺 umm hi guys  i got the CIMB AWSM card when i was a student  $500 credit limit no minimum spend and no annual fee… was wondering if there’s other cards with no Minimum spend and no annual fee since i just started my first FT Job…,btohqsg
Not so soon lah now planning stage. But TH or TW. Or if I’m rich any of the golden passport locations,btohqsg
My CPF got so little money I have more in crypto,btohqsg
To those who have issue opening the HSBC app,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGdo you plan to give up passport for AU?,btohqsg
Actually JP also not bad place to retire. Chicken genius now spends most of his time in JP,btohqsg
Not for now  I still value the Singapore citizenship,btohqsg
Some issues I identified with retiring in JP:- Earthquakes- Language- Xenophobia- Depreciating currency- Aging population,btohqsg
CIMB Credit card and HSBC Revolution do not charge annual fee,btohqsg
Yeah i agree. Ruiming from Woke Salaryman already has a retirement house in Japan,btohqsg
I’m leaning towards TW rather than JP due to cultural differences. Even though I can speak the language I hate many aspects of the culture,btohqsg
Basically as a gaijin in JP you will never make friends so you will be isolated,btohqsg
Never on so even I try on n off as same problemCLast x no issue so shld be their update of problem..,btohqsg
