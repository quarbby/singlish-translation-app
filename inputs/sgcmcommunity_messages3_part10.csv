Wa. I wash myself like every 2 weeks man. Plus i do it like at freaking 6am in the morning. Paint no clear coat  collect dust very easily.,btohqsg
Lucky i drive a mini fit only. Easy and quick to wash :D,btohqsg
clear coat quality is most important in protection,btohqsg
I do it late at night 11pm or 12mn,btohqsg
I use the waterjet  hopefully doesnt wake the neighbours up. If i go after 8pm  normally already someone there washing. lol,btohqsg

"‚úâÔ∏èYOUR SAY: Consider separate COE category for electric vehicles""With Singapore‚Äôs push towards a greener environment  there must be attractive incentives to nudge motorists to switch to EVs "" says a TODAY reader.üöóhttps://tdy.sg/353ZrAO@todayonlinesg",btohqsg

Lol scared kena scratch have to go without pay for a few months,btohqsg
Petrol stations on our side have until 1st April to milk usüò§,btohqsg
For EV to take off in a big way  Malaysia side also need to buck up on their network of charging station. What‚Äôs the use of having a EV only to be able to use in Singapore. Don‚Äôt make sense right?,btohqsg
Actually no issue going to kl or desaru already   got ppl tried it   in fact going desaru don‚Äôt need to charge also,btohqsg
Where to buy and top up touch&go card in sg,btohqsg
Singapore do not have. You have to buy at the msia custom,btohqsg
Ask JB friend to buy for you.Only solution.Befriend some JB chef working in Kopitiam below your block üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe got sell in the counter üòÖPreviously they do sell.Then they stopped üòÖ,btohqsg
was doing road trips in msia last month. The environment is very different. you dont interact with cops anymore  they just catch you speeding and summon your vehicle number. My guess is every once in a while they will catch everyone at the border and make all pay one shot.Avoiding malaysian cops on highway now is dead easy  use waze app and slow down when you see the police logo ahead. I drove from johor to penang and back and not once was the waze app wrong,btohqsg
Think 7 11 can but need go Malaysia top up,btohqsg
https://www.ezlink.com.sg/ez-link-x-touch-n-go-motoring-card/you can use as touch and go and nets cashcard,btohqsg
to add to this  sometimes by the time waze warns you police ahead  you might already be in their radar range. so dont wait for the app to warn you. proactively scan the road ahead on the app for the police logo and slow down the moment you see it (before the app actually warns you),btohqsg
Rolls Royce Phantom holds up traffic because the driver claimed he could not pass due to a BMW X6 not parking properlyEven ten people can squeeze through that space. This coming Tuesday we can test this hypothesis liao!React with...ü§î: If you think 10 people could easily squeeze through that space!ü§¨: If you think the Rolls Royce driver is being a bullyüò±: If you are shocked by the Rolls Royce driver's lousy skillsRead the full storyüëâüèªhttps://bit.ly/3tyZSwy,btohqsg
It's an X5 and I think even if hit the bmw will be the one getting scratched,btohqsg
This is why you don‚Äôt buy a Rolls lol,btohqsg
You buy a Rolls Royce but you engage a chauffeur,btohqsg
Precisely  waste money on a lousy chauffeur,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I‚Äôm a relatively new driver  got into an accident  hit a car in front of me that jammed brake on the highway. The person is not replying to my text to personal settlement  I have decided to just report to my insurance.Can anyone guide me on how to go about doing it? Thanks! I‚Äôm under NTUC income.,btohqsg
Yes accident happened earlier at 7pm on PIE,btohqsg
Thanks! So basically I have to go down to the accident reporting centre tomorrow to inform them?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt take too many photos as there were a lot of cars  took a few shots but captured the extent of damage and also my own vehicle.,btohqsg
Hi Wei Ming  hope you are not hurt from the accident!Here‚Äôs is a general guide to what you should do in an accident:https://m.sgcarmart.com/articles/articleinfo.php?CT=a&AID=29,btohqsg
Thank you to all for your help. Thankfully my family and I wasn‚Äôt hurt as the accident wasn‚Äôt a super serious one.,btohqsg
U hit him and u wan private actually he shd be the one happy. Maybe ws ask him to so police report instead so ws can work with him to chop u carrot after he bill your insurance. Better report police,btohqsg
So even there was no injury  police report must be made? I thought otherwise.,btohqsg
He replied me and told me that he‚Äôll going for an assessment and let me know his bill tomorrow. If it is above what is quoted to me by a few of my friends who run workshops  I‚Äôll tell him to settle w my insurance company.,btohqsg
If there's no injury  you do not need to make a police report,btohqsg
Noted. Thank you all for all your inputs. Will be heading down to make a report at my insurance centre. Will be more careful in the future.,btohqsg
Hi all  am relatively new here as well. Any good advice on what to be done for hit & run case when car is parked stationary? Unfortunately  my dash cam wasn‚Äôt recording when car is parked.,btohqsg
Ask your neighbours if they captured anything lol,btohqsg
If police camera are nearby  can report police for assistance?,btohqsg
Had left notes on all neighboring cars to seek for their help to provide any footages if possible.,btohqsg
Walked up and down the whole MSCP  didn‚Äôt find any camera monitoring the carpark. Most cameras are angled to monitor people/walkway unfortunately.,btohqsg
It sucks...hope the damage isn't severe...,btohqsg
