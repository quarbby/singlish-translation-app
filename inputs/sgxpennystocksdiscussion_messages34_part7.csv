Medical counters have been around for many years. Just that the hidden potential was not unveiled. But with high profile infections going on  it can only go up. Same as a multi baggers stock. I goggle  on some of these stocks and have some understanding on their profile. And Guess what  medical stocks fit it to a Perfect T.  On why I would see beyond 2020 / 2021.  Well  the daily news  will be full of potential breakthrough or some political leaders coming out as Cheerleaders for their home grown vaccines.  I prefer to put on a mask and take my chance than getting a jab. For the young investors  no harm in holding.  In this present time  parking money with stocks that have a foreseeable future is a no brainer.,btohqsg
There are cheaper version selling at Jurong East interchange.  Would anyone dare to risk it?,btohqsg
Think many dare  given the low community cases currently,btohqsg
Funny is that the boss kept buying but the price not moving. Why?,btohqsg
Be patient haha.. boss chan is a shrewd man he won't keep buying for nth one,btohqsg
What quality of mask u buy determine how you value your life.,btohqsg
Don't know why once the price went up 66  there sure someone will throw the price down. Infact boss chan already own 71% of this stock.,btohqsg
If u look at the chart there was false breakout on 18 Sep  then noticed late selldown ytd afternoon.. im guessing could be contra players cutting loss or force sell,btohqsg
Alset likes to have a few false break to trap retailers before absorbing those stop losses and have a power break upwards,btohqsg

So many times. Next time dunno change what,btohqsg
Yes. My personal view.  Put yourself as a businessman  it is a Low cost venture with high potential. Only need to be patient. No quick money.,btohqsg
I believe eindec has long term potential too,btohqsg
Anan have announcement think Monday will have some movement,btohqsg
Hope can still grab some at 0.033,btohqsg
*I believe eindec has long term potential too*Yes  Eindec is a good buy. In my opinion this counter will move up on Monday as the volume was quite on Friday.,btohqsg

Why SCM become penny?From few dollars become penny.Obvious is management .Many stuck high and thatâ€™s it.,btohqsg
