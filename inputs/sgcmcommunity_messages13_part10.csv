You're right  problems just cannot solve one,btohqsg
there is never ending problem in this world. stop being expert here. the objective is to limit the problems. if going electric solves the most pressing problems of pollutions  then it is already worth your while to do it.,btohqsg
but how is that old school may i ask? i personally feel no continental or japanese infotainment can even match up to bmw's current system,btohqsg
even japan's best infotainment through the new subarus and hondas arent close to the usability of idrive haha,btohqsg
Maybe i just prefer merz ui.Also all the yellow interior lighting is a ðŸ¥±How come most bmw still using the old sch door lock long knob thing ah,btohqsg
Just one last question  what are you driving these days?,btohqsg
idrive allows you to change it too! :),btohqsg
Change the map cabin lights to white?,btohqsg
just one last question  how long have you been chatting here?,btohqsg
my family members have owned many recent BMWs and i can confidently say that its the most usable and technologically advanced system!,btohqsg
eh? they can go from blue to green to even purple!,btohqsg
One last question on this topic sir,btohqsg
I am going to say unpopular opinion: Do we really need the advance technology inside as ICE?,btohqsg
when did you sit in the 3 series was it recent? haha because the new g80 models allow you to change colours if thats your only issue haha,btohqsg
It's no secret bmw is one of the top AD sales in sg,btohqsg
Really ah? Not that i know of or the sales person mentioned,btohqsg
Maybe i shld visit again.. the sales person nv mentioned anything. Terrible. Maybe its just me cos i no potential,btohqsg
nope  thats why i like the ford model T the most,btohqsg
Don't need  basic radio and music with some aircon controls can already. Maybe manual cruise control as a luxury to keep us under speed limit in the mce,btohqsg
Actually it's swaying towards Mercedes in that regard,btohqsg
Mercedes is the so called top selling of the big 3,btohqsg
"Thanks to the ""interiors"" and the cycle and carriage 10 year warranty which comes with extra service tax ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—",btohqsg
HAHAHAH just kidding la  too a certain extent i think need  but i love the cars from the 90s. Pure driving pleasure that one,btohqsg
i think merc and bmw make one of the best ICE engines in the world really haha,btohqsg
This one ambient lighting. Not the map and cabin light colour,btohqsg
That's why so many car makers are sourcing their engines,btohqsg
cabin colour is ambient lighting no? haha,btohqsg
according to german  it is Porsche! trhe pinnacle of german engineering,btohqsg
Oh you mean the reading lights above?,btohqsg
Those are white LEDs now as well I believe,btohqsg
but porsche is not affordable to anyone no? furthermore they are mid engined and hard to work on!,btohqsg
their cayennes used VR6s and parts were hard to source too  so you have to consider reliability too,btohqsg
if you say mass markets  bmw does have good engines,btohqsg
i think the germans from 90s is true german engineering,btohqsg
all beautiful cars to work on,btohqsg
Porsche was never affordable. Gone were teh days of Porsche (volkswagen) 924 and Boxster,btohqsg
bmw and mercedes i can agree but other makes maybe not as parts can be hard to find too,btohqsg
it is one of the best - alfaromeo. superb,btohqsg
Driven vs ownership different. If you test drive new car condition,btohqsg
Once the problems start see how you enjoy,btohqsg
Test drive car always diff. Cos u need to own it to know it,btohqsg
wow! rare breed eh? totally zero issues?,btohqsg
and driven like 35000+km in a year for 4 years,btohqsg
U like owned everything only bro  y no honda,btohqsg
But I thought you want to drive electric only?,btohqsg
Well if you have 3 cars and can afford 1 car always in workshop  then it is nothing,btohqsg
after 2000  under fiat  alfa cars have improved.,btohqsg
35k in 4 years is actually very little tho  cant compare the reliability of a car if little mileage is done haha,btohqsg
Lovely. Which ones have you owned?,btohqsg
i 1 year 40k leh howðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
