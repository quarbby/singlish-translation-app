Or the bsmt1 meet when they first had a public meet that kind of cars that were there,btohqsg
dont bother attending alot of the meets then,btohqsg
ur best bets are cnk and 0808,btohqsg
yall got like scary standards for cars fr,btohqsg
sorry but civic and vios doesn’t cut it,btohqsg
Ok but like u tell me,btohqsg
Nah not rlly but it’s kinda like once  you’ve seen all your standards auto go higher,btohqsg
But Like everybody have nice cars  I respect all builds,btohqsg
No leh. I think nowadays the standards are lower,btohqsg
I like his choice of SSR wheels,btohqsg
I respect all builds but some people need to chill  2 kids take picture of their car does not mean they own the scene. That's more of the problem nowadays,btohqsg
I rmb one guy kena trash talk for calling ppl regular traffic,btohqsg
Also why I like Dempsey cnks more because it's pure respect for engineering  cars and maintaining the cars and enjoying them rather than oh I am stage this stage that  this kit etc.,btohqsg
Then when someone wif a non regular traffic car poke him. His ego come out,btohqsg
Static a bit difficult unless can get jt dialed in perfectly for street use also.,btohqsg
Then still wan talk big HAHAHA and anyhow shoot the guy ask him show his car,btohqsg
The cla is static I think and he scrapes everywhere,btohqsg
DUDE THATS SICK AF NGL i love how low it goes,btohqsg
most of them on bags but got some static,btohqsg
pretty sure the red bimmer is static,btohqsg
Personally not a fan of slammed cars but that’s personal,btohqsg
Someday he's gonna be fast enough to rip his sideskirt off and cause damage to another,btohqsg
The cla is not irfanian_ eh?,btohqsg
Issit? Then why I see him driving at the same height and park at the same height everywhere while scraping on humps and road undulations?,btohqsg
Well at least the guy didn’t bother showing up ah coz mr “regular traffic” would have gotten his face thrown away,btohqsg
Ok i think one way to look at it isTraffic car or not  they spend money to make their car look how they want so like 🤷As long as you dont shit talk thier build in front of thier face or sum like datAlso regarding standards and taste Personal Opinion,btohqsg
Ok video but he drive low is danger to the roads so I cba,btohqsg
I think the standard is set it’s just ur own opinion if that car is above or beyond the standard,btohqsg
Once you see a flying sideskirt coming at you then you know,btohqsg
Air up or road just bumpy? Lmao,btohqsg
his 3 series was lower and he was running more camber,btohqsg
but this car give alot problem compared to 3er,btohqsg
Opine in front of their face but respect them better than shit talk behind and suck up in front of them,btohqsg
Everyone is entitled to an opinion  there's just a way of putting it out there with due respect,btohqsg
I swear the minervas are like over 10k plus like the rebarrel i think idk,btohqsg
Even Honda Grom have aftermarket for air suspension 😋,btohqsg
If the other person is mature  they would understand as well,btohqsg
Ya just dont say it in front of them can alr they build their cars for them not you yr not entitled to them,btohqsg
But wat if the owners think they are above everyone else,btohqsg
Air up but not all the way lah,btohqsg
Then we shld put them down right,btohqsg
Agree but don't suck up to them also then bitch behind their backs if you talking to them,btohqsg
But u only put them down if u drive a better car!!,btohqsg
Yea I wish I had time to press the button on my controller while driving on unpredictable road surface,btohqsg
@iamiggyI'm coming to air out yours,btohqsg
That one only if they do but u nvr see them mocking us ppl rite,btohqsg
Why need drive better car to put down egoistic people?,btohqsg
Well  usually they would air up before moving lah.. they not stupid lah..,btohqsg
Got good car can humble or not?,btohqsg
I’ve seen a “non regular traffic” guy challenge a gtr owner to show car and don’t talk so much,btohqsg
I mean it’s more of a ego push issue,btohqsg
Honestly if you got car you alr living sia,btohqsg
Doesnt matter if its a POS,btohqsg
It’s like if a 1 Series driver is being 1 dog and like let’s say I try to humble him there’s much of a power struggle there,btohqsg
Car is car. Have one? Drive it. Enjoy it.,btohqsg
Fuck u I give example only,btohqsg
you dont be cock and be ego and just keep yr opinion to yrself,btohqsg
Ik an owner who needs this,btohqsg
tcss can but if personal opinion  just keep to self. If LTA opinion  then debate with logical evidence,btohqsg

You feed too much until he cannot sit,btohqsg
Better not cycle on the road tho u never pay road tax🙈,btohqsg
Do you even know how hard it is to even organize meets and gather enthusiasts in this strict country lmao. How about you organize since you talk like its so easy,btohqsg
how are u gonna shit on other peoples car if you dont even have a car (let alone a licence)☺️,btohqsg
he wasnt shitting on anyone's car ?,btohqsg
i shit on them? i state facts bro,btohqsg
if u drive regular fucking traffic don’t act like ur vip,btohqsg
Let’s say even if he has a car. And let’s say it’s bttr than anyone’s car in this grp he still will get shat on for being arrogant lol,btohqsg
It’s a simple Yes or no qn bro 🤣 one word would have sufficed,btohqsg
Regular traffic in the sense he meant it isn't derogatory?,btohqsg
He just said if you're looking out for what the person said he's looking out for,btohqsg
Don't go for all the meets  you won't see what you want,btohqsg
Meets more for appreciating the culture,btohqsg
saying don't bother and regular traffic... isn't that rude enough,btohqsg
did u not read what he replied to,btohqsg
Is this the real TikTok guy,btohqsg
sister i already read. maybe u are not an owner so u don't know how it feels for people to just talk about cars like that.,btohqsg
us owners go to meets to enjoy  showcase our car whether it's an expensive car or now  meet new people,btohqsg
Ppl call my cla regular traffic leh,btohqsg
Itsokie kids   just stick to seeing cars instead of owning one☺️☺️,btohqsg
Regular traffic definition simple: if you go out on a drive and see more than 4 of the car you're literally traffic,btohqsg
And it doesn't have to be derogatory,btohqsg
Yalor I mean if u think that way then that’s great for u  other ppl saying car meets not worth to attend is their statement and their problem lo,btohqsg
Owning a car is alr hard enough in singapore. At least pls appreciate the joy the drivers bring to us w their own cars with hard earned money. Those w cars js wna have fun socialising at meets. I unds if ppl say meets not worth i unds their opinions but  i feel that mayb we all need to work on rephrasing no matter how real it might sound to everyone else to prevent any conflicts like this.,btohqsg
Im speaking thru 3rd person pov.,btohqsg
All I see is  people who go to meets to see cars shouldn't go in with any expectations,btohqsg
People there with their cars enjoy the company,btohqsg
Thrs no need to throw slurs and insults  cos at the end of time the ones getting hurt by owning a car thru hard work r the owners  not the spotters.,btohqsg
At the end of the day car meets are mainly for the owners to bond over and whatever others say shouldn’t really matter  unless it’s q directed ah,btohqsg
This is the reaction that's sad,btohqsg
Not the one telling this person not to go for a meet if they're looking for a certain type of cars,btohqsg
All yall carspotters  car enthusiasts whoever u guys are etc  literally everyone here. The owners of their own cars r not at the meet to get thrown insults and jeered at.,btohqsg
Im sure all of us know the purpose of a car meet  its to bond n socialise positively,btohqsg
Those that have been holding car meets sure want this intention to be set out to the country full of car enthusiasts,btohqsg
And like he said  if you're looking for specific kinds of cars and can't appreciate everything/can't socialise. Don't bother going,btohqsg
Whrs the positivity in our car meets?,btohqsg
exactly what im trying to say 😭,btohqsg
Every car meet ive been to  i see yps and car enthusiasts n carspotters (idw to name all) jeering at cars,btohqsg
I mean they’re just doing their job LOL,btohqsg
And also id like to address the stereotype on female drivers,btohqsg
okay true but still wanna firebomb LTAHQ,btohqsg
Why issit that everytime issa females car u guys like to jeer upon it? And always ask for the male driver instead? We need the respect on both ends,btohqsg
I think what their doing is q justified based on the incidents that happen lo,btohqsg
Got no choice when there's people out there anyhow driving  going cheap on mods that may affect safety (cheap tyres  brakes  shitty wiring  etc.),btohqsg
U guys need to know ur limits n boundaries to ALL ENTHUSIASTS N SPOTTERS AND EVERYONE IN THIS CHAT.,btohqsg
Correct  at the end of the day it’s just for the safety of everyone,btohqsg
I unds thats why its nvr been seen on the bigger picture,btohqsg
Everyone needs to bond back agn,btohqsg
Look at the other car meets from other countries,btohqsg
I mean sure some do jeer,btohqsg
But from what i observe its still not as bad as singapore,btohqsg
bro can keep politics per say out of a car chat not,btohqsg
Most r supportive of each other out thr for their own builds and respect the quality and work put into their cars,btohqsg
Screw them thenIgnore themAppreciate the cars with photos  attention and if you are courageous enough  the driver,btohqsg
Im not a driver nor am i an owner  but yet i feel bad for all the owners who have had their cars jeered at for nth,btohqsg
U guys deserve to b appreciated btr,btohqsg
But all in all we still a community,btohqsg
Whatever you do  there will be someone who does not agreeScrew them,btohqsg
I unds but still lets all put in some effort to try n minimise this shall we?,btohqsg
Just shut up or piss off,btohqsg
I mean at the end of the day everyone has their own opinion  it’s their personal choice and personality to keep that opinion to themselves,btohqsg
If you do not like the build  buy a stock model  get the one you want,btohqsg
Not justifying it! Just saying that we cannot rlly control it ah,btohqsg
But their mouth won’t shut one,btohqsg
Your ear canYour attention can be redirected.,btohqsg
Ever saw the video with the woman talking about climate change and a v12 just revs?,btohqsg
Agreed but still lets js try n minimise the toxicity in sg car communities,btohqsg
Cus for me stock or modify car all still the same i will take both  pic for them 👍,btohqsg
Ya end of the day it’s your choice if uw give attention to it,btohqsg
Basically nothing good to say just do say,btohqsg
I do not care about itAs long as it does not get in my way,btohqsg
Basc if u still want to jeer that’s u just being an asshole lo,btohqsg
Its cos i see that its been recurring for insults to b getting in drivers’ ways,btohqsg
Nothing we can do to chance it,btohqsg
Thats why i felt a need to talk abt it,btohqsg
I used to be only like modified car ended up i change mind set to like both stock and modify car,btohqsg
Honestly if got 2 driver fight let them settle Lor don’t blow it up at all,btohqsg
Ya ik what u mean I walk talking abt the women driver thing,btohqsg
Cos its my friends who r owners,btohqsg
If you think person x is in the way of car y  either do something about it there or get on with your lifeThat is my attitudeEither do something about it to the person who is causing it or ignore it,btohqsg
I mean don rlly need to do anyth ah just ignore so it doesn’t blow up into another matter,btohqsg
Man up  go up to him  ask him to step asideIf not i would ignore,btohqsg
And im sure if ur friends who r owners feel this way yall wldnt wan that to happen also,btohqsg
Up to youSo far  i do not hear/see any negativity from anyoneMaybe because i am not observant enough  maybe i have not gone to enough meets,btohqsg
