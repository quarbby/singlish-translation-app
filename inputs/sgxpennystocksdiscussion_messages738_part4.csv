Financial technology orFintechis a broad term referring to using technology to deliver financial services instead of the traditional approach. This term has grown to encompass Artificial intelligence  Blockchain  cloud computing  big data  payment processing  software  hardware and anything else under the sun that iscontributing to an improvement from traditional financial services.,btohqsg

He still think everyone support him after Tuesday? Very likely the GPS members all go support PH after DAP apologize,btohqsg
He scared he become nx najib… during covid he eat alot money for sure,btohqsg
GPS also don't like PAS but they don't support PH initially because of DAP. Anwar smart move getting DAP to apologize,btohqsg
Lol.. they only apologize after BN confirmed😛,btohqsg

Global Focus for 2023 - Energy crisis as priority.My view is that many energy counter will be in big play from Dec 22 onwards.Coal and LNG counters to have more focus as many nations will turn to these fossil fuels due to it being the cheaper and more available alternatives that are easier accessible and transported.,btohqsg
Interesting 🤨 Indeed  Right after hands are shook for the 20B deal to transition l.Hmmm  No need for more wordsGeo Energy ($0.355) clearly undervalued counter I will not be surprised for half or even double bag in 2023. DYODD too. As long as the energy crisis persists  my view remains.Source:https://news.mongabay.com/2022/11/indonesia-to-build-coal-plants-despite-20b-deal-on-clean-energy-transition/amp/,btohqsg
Geo energy at a bargain now since it’s consolidating here at support before the $0.01 dividends in Dec 22.,btohqsg
Am visualising plenty of energy related crisis news popping in the big news channels as we move into winter period.Unfortunately  but this would bring about max attention to energy counters.Geo is the only one left in SGX as GEAR is going for the delist.I’m imagining the GEAR BBs coming into GEO too  interesting it shall be,btohqsg
Pollux support and buy zones $0.038 to $0.040 is where I will add or collect some.It just broke up of a near term downtrend pressure line with some volume building for the reversal.If market maintains  should see them make a move up. If it does OSOD to TP thanks 🙏🏻,btohqsg
As anticipated  the energy crunch/demand  news are starting to pour in. But as usual  many retailers will prefer to buy  for example when crazy euphoria sets in. When the mainstream media is on it  even GEO at $0.50/$0.75/$1.00 etc  people will still buy.(Covid-19 was the biggest play in 2020 where stocks like medtecs from $0.04 to $1.98 and many eventual got stuck and became bag-holders)I believe Energy crunch might yet be the biggest play in 2023). My view  calculated approach as I study GEO FA  cash position  NAV  demand for their products and macro view.Also  I hope retailers are starting to get smarter and make better bets and investments and get in at cheap/good value before any possible pump comes .Together  retailers we can get there. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼,btohqsg
