text,group
And let me show u what it is,btohqsg
Is either for like rly close friends or the more than friends,btohqsg
@whatisgrasshow much did you struggle in j1 btw,btohqsg
I actually cant believe his nice thoughts,btohqsg
I burnt out like 5-6 times,btohqsg
Coz i actually dun hv time to meet him het,btohqsg
Plus this yr the cny n vday too close,btohqsg
i mean it is what it is,btohqsg
is he from your course or smth,btohqsg
I burnt out 2 weeks before A levels,btohqsg
Imagine A levels in 2 weeks i freaking woke up at 11am,btohqsg
i burnt out bf olvls and it wasn't good,btohqsg
Got 1 period is just damn bad for an entire month,btohqsg
uhh first time i burned out was 1st year of postgrad,btohqsg
better than those ppl who only get their period during exam,btohqsg
I don't only have studies stuff I also got like official role and stuff,btohqsg
Then I think I q involved w my cca shit,btohqsg
I show u this it sounds really romantic,btohqsg
aiyo cos i alr got class leadership,btohqsg
Like coz i told him about my jc experienfe,btohqsg
I get into smth I legit crazy abt it,btohqsg
So I can legit do work for hours straight,btohqsg
idk how ppl can manage their leadership roles  cca  family time  handphone time  studying time and hanging out with friends all in one day,btohqsg
Actually same bruh u not alone,btohqsg
I also Inc ppls bday aha,btohqsg
i have dedicated time periods for doing work that i don't touch,btohqsg
for me that's easier said than done,btohqsg
But i literally the only time im not doing work is when im eating or in sch during lesson or transportation,btohqsg
like monday and tuesday i never hang out with people,btohqsg
planning from a guys pov is DAMN HARD,btohqsg
For me is cuz I alrd,btohqsg
Still better than me  some of the papers I got 0 hours of sleep the day before because I was too nervous,btohqsg
Pig lifestyle that is not healthy,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like my sleep pattern was fked up from the start,btohqsg
Not doing work when I'm like w my friends,btohqsg
Partly my fault that i got the mugger title,btohqsg
ohh  cos i usually don't hang out w ppl on mon and thurs,btohqsg
that's kinda unhealthy but it's ending soon,btohqsg
Then the day before some of the papers I just toss and turn for like 5-6h,btohqsg
cos im rlly behind on my lects,btohqsg
For math I barely got any sleep but thankfully not many careless mjstakes,btohqsg
and my tutorials gonna start soon,btohqsg
Wah mines a idc what day I see if i can work things in,btohqsg
Meanwhile uni is the exact opposite,btohqsg
I cant find any motivation at this rate,btohqsg
if i have a stupid 5-6h break bf cca then idm gg out for lunch,btohqsg
if not ill just go lib and get my shit done,btohqsg
Bruh it will affect ur results more than anything,btohqsg
Generally I don't have that much issues ah,btohqsg
oh just read the mindef thing lol,btohqsg
im on my third chem chapter. THIRD,btohqsg
But the j2 topics r kicking me in the balls,btohqsg
Im surprised i didnt end up suffering mental health issues in jc,btohqsg
I got lucky I guess. Math needs the most concentration,btohqsg
But I still donâ€™t know whether YTâ€™s careless mistakes pushed him down to a B,btohqsg
APPARENTLY THE PPL IN VJ ONLY DO THAT IN J2,btohqsg
But im suffering fr one nowâ€¦like whenever i go to this particular class  my legs just starts feeling weak and sweaty palm,btohqsg
uni and jc are not comparable,btohqsg
at least get the hard stuff done (ik there's harder stuff to come later),btohqsg
when i reach vectors it's joever,btohqsg
We did test on vectors hor,btohqsg
for me i've basically made work a part of daily life and usual routine,btohqsg
instead of being like wah sian i need to get this done,btohqsg
Speaking of which there was once i got 81 percentile for d in econs,btohqsg
if i S for maths in yi i think im 99th percentile alr ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But i dun remember math being low,btohqsg
Uk in j1 they gave us exact numbers,btohqsg
bro could have gotten into ri,btohqsg
i just saw my promos grades,btohqsg
GP DGeog CChem UMath DPhysics A,btohqsg
Yea they gave in 20 ranges,btohqsg
If it makes y'all feel btr,btohqsg
im predicting that my promo grades will be USUC/K,btohqsg
I got talk w my parents hor,btohqsg
The Cher straight up told me,btohqsg
Even if she 4 yr younger than u ?,btohqsg
"the cher straight up told my seniors dad ""why ur daughter so useless""",btohqsg
Bro why u posted my promo grade,btohqsg
Truly the physics god in the making,btohqsg
passing econs and gp is massive W,btohqsg
My promos were likeGp EChem BPhy DMath EEcons U,btohqsg
that's like about my standard also,btohqsg
Coz it gives me the free subject prize,btohqsg
My y4 promosEL AHCL AHist AChinese lit A*Bio BChem CMath AMath 2 C,btohqsg
"the funniest part for me is the ct coments ""A keen learner who constantly thrives for excellence  he grasps new concepts and explanations quickly""",btohqsg
They hv the top in subject prize or was it removed again,btohqsg
It is a joke if it is removed again,btohqsg
Idk how yall be getting As for school exams but i fr have never seen an A in my report card before from p1 to j2,btohqsg
Coz right it was there when i was in j1 and then they removed it when i was in j2 and then it came back the yr after,btohqsg
i wanna know who it is,btohqsg
ok i will send in dec,btohqsg
my progress from p6 is funny,btohqsg
I was on a streak of 4 physics 100th percentile,btohqsg
i wld wear cycling glasses but not that,btohqsg
My one is down ward curve,btohqsg
P4 cuz of stuff I hit like borderline passing,btohqsg
And i remembered in mye  i got d and it was 98th,btohqsg
Then sudd p5 got huge motiv for psle,btohqsg
For a P6 kid I think,btohqsg
Abit the hard to 90rp ah...,btohqsg
I think it's a skill issue  doesn't have anything to do with gender or sex,btohqsg
Eh fucking hell if I get 90rp,btohqsg
bro you shld be a full time tutor,btohqsg
2k is good for everything at 27inch,btohqsg
90 rp success story by val,btohqsg
until i saw a 2k 27inch monitor,btohqsg
Well there is something called the interview to screw up,btohqsg
i ask my juniors to go to ur tuition centre,btohqsg
I support ur move to 90rp val,btohqsg
if u want 1080p 27inch i can sell u mine aso hehe,btohqsg
Siaoliang in S4 series who got on the list when,btohqsg
And yes I took my combi knowing that,btohqsg
i ask myself the same question everyday,btohqsg
wtf la you got 2 A+,btohqsg
My combi is also no med,btohqsg
idk how you cope with the humans,btohqsg
Geog just makes sense for me,btohqsg
i go take PBCM alr la,btohqsg
i'm more proud of my A for LA tbh,btohqsg
"""im BCMe but idw take med""""WHAT""",btohqsg
I nvr put in as much effort for geog oneðŸ’€,btohqsg
so many people here suffering from success,btohqsg
i also nvr put much effort for any subject,btohqsg
U can bullshit and smoke one,btohqsg
i put in 0 effort for gp,btohqsg
it's ok just go uni smoke till fch,btohqsg
I rmb i rote 4 lines for a 1m ans,btohqsg
i like the content subjs - but GP no,btohqsg
i hope pw will be manageable,btohqsg
if my grpmates talk cock sing song then gg lor,btohqsg
bc i probs dk half the content anyway,btohqsg
I go tell Chen zhengyu that soa,btohqsg
I got D for practical and overall 78,btohqsg
ngl the fact i don't remember anything about my a level papers or prelims should speak volumes on how little i cared,btohqsg
actly if I tell him he'll prolly more likely be like how tf ik u,btohqsg
idk how yall remember what you got for prelims,btohqsg
or sometimes even what came out,btohqsg
My chem cher literally told me just focus on ur content,btohqsg
"a levels is the time when you think about ""wtf bmt is in less than a year  gg liao""",btohqsg
I think she was also shooked,btohqsg
real  i was more worried about ns than a levels,btohqsg
I turned it to overall A,btohqsg
I only rmb abt like how crazy my maths jump was,btohqsg
same sia  i worry about my ippt,btohqsg
im gonna get UUU for my ippt,btohqsg
i draw the graph first then i plot the points,btohqsg
i've never seen a score like that on my paper for anything but physics LOL,btohqsg
wah eh i found my pri sch report book,btohqsg
I just came to realise how i turned the practical d to AðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
if that's my GP paper i go celebrate liao,btohqsg
Wah uk what  my j1 physics was low 70s and it was 100th percentile,btohqsg
i rmb i got 26/75 for my prelims chem p2 ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
ok yea i rmb that part i think,btohqsg
I smoke harder than my geog and econs papers eh,btohqsg
Meanwhile my phy and chem stuff are still in my room,btohqsg
i only kept physics from a levels bc i thought maybe i can refresh before uni starts,btohqsg
i did not look at it once,btohqsg
the entire stack of school papers and questions they gave for a level prep,btohqsg
Physics was a big miracle for me coz it went fr straight C5 to A2 to A,btohqsg
i will never take physics again,btohqsg
Same idea why my chem stuff in my room,btohqsg
when the paper is too easy  well  your A is gone,btohqsg
all the binded stuff are prelim papers from other schs organised by topic and by year,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok hear ppl say a-level phy doing phy in general a disgrace lol,btohqsg
I took H1 because of O lvl and i never regretted not going H2,btohqsg
Maybe explains why I got C for chiðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i will never regret not taking econs,btohqsg
Tho my h2 econs A only came at A levels,btohqsg
my grades peaked in pri sch,btohqsg
My grades started w a dip,btohqsg
Idk if I reach my peak yet,btohqsg
My grades dipped in relativity and quantum physics,btohqsg
U entered vj  at least ur ip went ok  and im pretty sure ur As too,btohqsg
Omg wait i disagree  but tbh my batch teachers all left  so I agree,btohqsg
HMMMM i entered vj by... psle ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
But dun u need to pass ip lmao,btohqsg
Some of my bro friend got kick out of vs ip to os,btohqsg
the condition for passing ip isn't that high leh,btohqsg
Mdm lee => mr lim wei jie,btohqsg
nothing can ever beat my psle LOL,btohqsg
i scraped through with gpa 2.8 until sec4 then still 2 something then did retest paper  i passed then promoted,btohqsg
I can whole heartedly agree  my bad yijc econs is bad and has been bad.,btohqsg
i wish i still have my cert to flex with you,btohqsg
Omg worst than last yr ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I scrolled my cherâ€™s past messages,btohqsg
Literally she has been chasing homework,btohqsg
I disagree that it is 7 groups  for us it was 4.,btohqsg
my p6 prelim or wtv was AAAA,btohqsg
predict yi mean rp with the new system,btohqsg
And said â€˜if u are struggling to keep up  i can accompany u to complete tmrâ€™,btohqsg
If you dont focus on yi too much right,btohqsg
i mean this is genuinely why i always hate on psle bc idt i deserved it,btohqsg
Focus that you are an a level student,btohqsg
My class got some ppl dun even do homework,btohqsg
I did Bad B A B A Merit,btohqsg
Either you forget you are in yi or you use yi as your enemy to do better and burn yi in hell or smth liddat,btohqsg
Like the classes are banded fr when,btohqsg
that one yi guy who got 90rp is my only motivation,btohqsg
I almost got a 200! ALMOST,btohqsg
my psle studying consisted of reading a science revision guide while watching TV so,btohqsg
with the assumption that you can catch up to other people in other JCs with potentially better tutors and greater support and also assuming that you flunk O level because of external issues such as nerves and not legit academic inclination issue,btohqsg
Made me interested in the subj,btohqsg
the bus to get you to hall,btohqsg
guys which is the worst bus number in sg,btohqsg
Then my sec sch chers made it interesting oso,btohqsg
my mom didn't want me go bc expensive + didn't know the opportunities that hcl and ri give,btohqsg
because i still wanted to have fun and fool around in school HAHAHAH,btohqsg
but i regretted not trying for nush,btohqsg
our initial target was vs bc nearby,btohqsg
were u the highest scoring psle person in ur class,btohqsg
and this was pre IP VS,btohqsg
All i rmb was i did tuition in p6 and got below 200 but removed tuition in sec sch and got a 13(-2) for Os.,btohqsg
no my pri sch generally does well,btohqsg
ironic that i got tuition for hcl only but it was my merit,btohqsg
then the tuition centre ask me print my cert for them to display,btohqsg
does hcl even help you with tscore,btohqsg
I rmb a fucking clear divide between the HCL and non HCL classes,btohqsg
the hcl ppl form a clique,btohqsg
they think they damn cracked in hcl,btohqsg
u want in between i give you in between,btohqsg
i rmb my year the cutoff for dhs was 260 then ri was 263,btohqsg
My sec sch is fake Chinese,btohqsg
U guys shld take over my pharmacy course,btohqsg
+1 for pass  +2 for merit +3 for distinction,btohqsg
i did shit for o lvls and hence i had to go yi,btohqsg
pri sch genius is not genius pal,btohqsg
that's why must free load hotpot bro,btohqsg
1/2 the cohort take hcl also,btohqsg
idk but kong hwa is so eh,btohqsg
Do ur best and be yiâ€™s first 70 pointer,btohqsg
generally wikipedia cant be a source to cite from right?,btohqsg
gp would like to say no,btohqsg
No  but U can try to look at the sources they site,btohqsg
*stares* but I scored 78 pts,btohqsg
I got a major culture shock when coming to pharmacy,btohqsg
the culture shock in uni for me is people are less assholes,btohqsg
"waiting for the first ""which course can i go with 69.99 rp with the new system"" reddit post",btohqsg
welcome to imposter syndrome whereby we doubt ourselves daily and wonder if we are truly good enough,btohqsg
you mean welcome to my life?,btohqsg
We are always off to a random topic,btohqsg
C6 hcl > any other grade,btohqsg
If ik iw JC frm s1,btohqsg
i failed HCL in sec 3 but got a B3 in the end so i'll take it,btohqsg
I would had tried for higher,btohqsg
My friend got like D7 or smth,btohqsg
at least can exempt H1 chinese ig,btohqsg
then my music C all the way but managed to get A 2 for Os,btohqsg
Meanwhile it is hard to do hcl if u dun do hcl in pri sch,btohqsg
but D7 is so morally draining,btohqsg
My sch requirement is v high,btohqsg
i got chinese tuition bc i shifted from pasir ris pri to kong hwa,btohqsg
Ended up with a C6. Still dont understand chinese,btohqsg
I had but always tryna waste time lol,btohqsg
spent 1000000000000 dollars on hcl tuition to get C6. very worth,btohqsg
Coz my parents got a home tutor,btohqsg
Tbh my spoken is still ok,btohqsg
Then when she come i go and take water  slow mo,btohqsg
i'm renouncing my chinese mother tongue,btohqsg
i cannot yap well in chinese but i can write well,btohqsg
I am 0 lingual. I suck at Chinese and English.,btohqsg
Math is not a language. It is a science,btohqsg
"""im a bilingual  it's just that my 2nd language is shit""",btohqsg
it is the language of science,btohqsg
Math is mental abuse to humans,btohqsg
My class doing tutorial in class,btohqsg
U saying U not human ah,btohqsg
The numbers are already complex. But they want to be more complex and become imaginary.,btohqsg
did not take HCL in Sec,btohqsg
do i sound like a normal human being to you val,btohqsg
finish the paper = guaranteed pass,btohqsg
Meanwhile i just want my graduation cap to be > 3,btohqsg
Is a human a human or a bunch of particles,btohqsg
My bro got ungraded for oral,btohqsg
Is a particle a particle? Is it an object or is it hypothetical,btohqsg
Wait ntu will expell ppl ah,btohqsg
If you do badly three times,btohqsg
But if u fall below 2,btohqsg
How do u even pull back up,btohqsg
Im glad im still in the course,btohqsg
if your GPA is below 2 means it's below a C average,btohqsg
guys dyk anyone who improved from f9 to a1 in any subject,btohqsg
which is like not hard to pull up if you legit try,btohqsg
i improved from D7 to A2 in humans,btohqsg
my GPA for y1 and 2 was like up down up down lol,btohqsg
I'm surprised I am in Physics. I never liked math in p3,btohqsg
I got C5 for combined lol,btohqsg
I sucked at math in p3,btohqsg
ik ppl who got a1 despite bombing ss,btohqsg
lol i alr knew i'd be in science but i didn't think i would be this into it,btohqsg
I nvr study for hist ss properly,btohqsg
Dr siyan got deans list anot,btohqsg
My friends in jc all wanna slap me,btohqsg
I nvr even study 1 entire book lvl,btohqsg
Oh fun fact the previous syllabus ss taught israel palestine war,btohqsg
That's when I realised maybe I rly am a humans person,btohqsg
I got slapped for saying i cant finish econs paper,btohqsg
Coz legit my class got toxic people,btohqsg
My friend slept for 1 hour in the H1 Econs A levels.,btohqsg
i got slapped for saying jc is fun,btohqsg
i only deans list bc my final year gpa was straight As,btohqsg
first two years about 4.5 so not enough,btohqsg
I saw a table beside me slept for the whole Maths paper 1,btohqsg
Like we meme abt the h3 maths guy being a math god,btohqsg
And he confirm 90 100rp or wtv,btohqsg
No one gets put down cuz of grades or wtv,btohqsg
He actually got a U  he did not come for paper 2 maths,btohqsg
Like what is ur problem w me mugging  and what is ur problem with my gradesâ€¦my hope what  they dun study it is none of my business  im by no means need to follow them  it is my body,btohqsg
mugging is love mugging is life (except gp that subj can kys),btohqsg
Asked for study tips from me ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I went back and see  once there were 1/2 the class owing homework,btohqsg
if my GP gets U and messes up my 70rp i will beat the shit out of cambridge,btohqsg
"I MUGGED DURING JC and then my classmate was like""its April  why are you mugging for A levels?""",btohqsg
Soz boss nvr took Phys so,btohqsg
My class half of them dun study  like started studying only after prelims,btohqsg
I just spam pract like mad,btohqsg
Ok but i do help ppl who text me to ask me questions regardless whether in my clique,btohqsg
But that only works for like,btohqsg
"Meanwhile a DHS student in sept asked me ""so how is studying""I said ""my class was addicted to mario lart""",btohqsg
you don't have the luxury of infinite number of questions to practise in uni,btohqsg
my friend asked why im mugging rn. BROTHER I AM NOT MUGGING. I AM CLEARLY BEHIND ON MY LECTURES AND I THINK I NEED TO REFRESH MY BRAIN ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
She have a literal list of,btohqsg
Mistakes she made from this topics,btohqsg
yea ik people that do that,btohqsg
For reals my 86% chem prelims p2 came from mugging and spamming practice,btohqsg
a mistake made twice is twice too often,btohqsg
my issue now is having to comb through a ton of literature to self learn and understand,btohqsg
i don't understand A i go find reference B,btohqsg
And uni there are no qns to practice,btohqsg
then they reference C so i find that,btohqsg
then in the end need to come up with a way to use it for my own thing,btohqsg
And there is no fixed tutor  a lot of sdl,btohqsg
I just read that phrase as self-h***,btohqsg
i hope i can TA you next sem to see your work,btohqsg
I thought U talking abt term assessment and I'm like,btohqsg
I think April got another one alrd,btohqsg
Kinda can't wait for cca step down fr sia,btohqsg
I will take all the bio mods to avoid you muahahahahahaha,btohqsg
Wait what do U do in lab,btohqsg
I tot it is compulsory for phd to TA,btohqsg
And do internship instead of attachment,btohqsg
uh in my case  literally sit there and do my work until someone needs my help,btohqsg
I get to be near radioactive substances :D,btohqsg
would i only review my lectures the week before my promos? hell no,btohqsg
think of it as like a QnA regarding the experiment and report,btohqsg
Ooh look at all those buttons,btohqsg
I mean a lot of reddit comments,btohqsg
i wonder if they are the culprit for making me dumber,btohqsg
reddits just full of stupid ppl in general,btohqsg
I dun care about labels in jc,btohqsg
That cant be true. A radioactive spider bit spiderman. He became a physics major at mit.,btohqsg
ikr  do they want me to retain or sum ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But im lucky i got good enough friends who dun ditch me because of mugging,btohqsg
Damn 800+ messages in 45 mins,btohqsg
in uni it was actually kinda really fun studying for finals for me,btohqsg
Jc there is no time to care about weird labels u may receive,btohqsg
like i rmb my friends and i all crash one hall lounge right,btohqsg
