2% lol. just lazy to move funds around. might just close this and move to something more useful,btohqsg
usually spend them at shengsiong or those accept coin place. easier,btohqsg

Eh I like to use Citibank cards as their miles wun expire until u want to use it. But to ask all the shifus here  what is a better card to use and earn miles? Haha,btohqsg
Citi reward with amaze it is 5 year expiry from card issue month,btohqsg
Ya I heard of amaze before  but in comparison with cardup  which is better?,btohqsg
Hi experts  I’m thinking of investing my SRS using poems. May I ask what’s the difference between “amundi msci world ii ucits etf” vs “amundi index msci world a12s (c)” which are both available on poems?,btohqsg
I use Citi PremierMiles card to earn miles for now. But dun know if I should consider other cards for this purpose,btohqsg
If you have only worked less then 6 months  you may want to opt for cards without income requirements or secured credit cards ($10k fixed deposit).,btohqsg
2 different things. You might want to be specific in your original question.,btohqsg
oh eh if i am looking at earning miles  can only use cardup?,btohqsg
If u dont want expired miles dbs altitude is 1.3 mpd. Normal card will be uob privi 1.4 mpd. High end card will be various bank like dbs vantage etc,btohqsg
You can check out CardUp calculator for eligible cards. We are not sure what you are asking for now lol. Why mention CardUp when you talking about earning miles?,btohqsg
"does transferring money  from DBS account to YouTrip via Paynow classify under ""payment"" category for multiplier interest calculation?",btohqsg
hello all  any credit card promotions now? thanks in advance!,btohqsg
For other spends  Citi rewards+ amaze is a much better combo,btohqsg
eh my main qns is wanting to know how best can i earn miles? i didn't know on what is cardup until it was mentioned here  so i am not sure on how i can use cardup to earn miles as well. sry for the confusion.,btohqsg
What's the point of using the UOB One card if you cant spend at least $500 on it? Might as well put everything on the UOB Lady's to earn 0.4mpd on the non-bonus category spend?,btohqsg
Hi  I am about to apply for a credit card  is it smart to let the bank decide the credit limit or is it better to decide on our own. Second question  will my credit limit with Bank A affect me if I try to apply another credit card for Bank B? Thank you,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ejWZOXCykbgSuggest you watch other videos on the same playlist to find out more about certain cards.,btohqsg
Then you won’t get the UOB one rebate. It needs min $500,btohqsg
I usually let bank decide my limit. Limit from one bank does not affect limit from another. Although i recall there was some agreement betwen trust and standard chartered.,btohqsg
I see  thanks for the insight!,btohqsg
Easiest is to let the bank decide. They have their way to calculate the credit limit  and they may just give you what they calculated if you over requested. Best practice to keep credit limits high.Credit limits are separated for each banks. They are more concerned if you are applying multiple cards in a short time  have defaulted/late payment before or if you are new to credit cards/loans. All are recorded in your CBS profile.Just make sure you pay off your bills inFULLevery month. If you can't then just don't get a credit card.,btohqsg
Thanks for all the reply  I heard from somewhere that all the bank share the same pool of credit limit (so if bank A used it up  bank B can’t issue it anymore). So this is a misconception?,btohqsg
No such thing. See second para of my earlier reply.Only same bank different cards share a pool.,btohqsg
You still need to hit $500 minimum spend monthly on UOB One Card to earn cashback.,btohqsg
Hi everybody  do you guys still know if ride hailing apps like Gojek and grab work with hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Indirectly it will affect as each bank has a risk exposure framework to determine each individual maximum unsecured exposure across all FI in SG. May not be apparent if you have only v few cards/unsecured loans.,btohqsg
It is not a pool but maximum unsecured exposure across all FIs in SG.,btohqsg
And even you consistently pay your minimum payment amount but if your outstanding balance  exceed 12x your monthly salary  your credit facilities will be suspended until you bring down your balance below the 12x.https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/explainers/ongoing-credit-checks-and-requirements/borrowing-limit-on-unsecured-credit,btohqsg
