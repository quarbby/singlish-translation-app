P5. Collect 30 everyone. But need to buy up.I believe this one double bagger at least but not so soon,btohqsg
P5 is in this business as Lim Shao Lin who bought shares in P5 back then runs this company and looks to me the next big big theme in global focus after medicals is green/renewable energy.Therefore  this one can be fry up.For now  it is blocked  wait til they are ready .30 bottomed as recent placement at 27DYoDD. Vested at 30,btohqsg
Here doing a 9-5 job and getting few ks a month ü•≤,btohqsg

Giving ibkr a try.. how's depositing money like? I don't see a FAST funding option for transferring of SGD,btohqsg
thers an option to choose for depositing... it will provide u e account details to tx in,btohqsg
quite good rates esp if ur into usa market and freq tradin due to very low fees,btohqsg
welcome  if dont need shares to b kept in cdp  this is good to use  not worth payin high comm fee with local brokerage,btohqsg
Indeed.. local brokerage fees are a rip-off... 25 dollar minimum per trade üôà,btohqsg
Yup  quite high... hope tiger and others can link up with cdp too.. then many will switch over ...ü§î,btohqsg
normally i use poems for e live price  trade via ib,btohqsg
Ah I see  makes sense as ibkr charges separately for live fees,btohqsg
I like how ibkr integrates the financial info and news all into one page..,btohqsg
yeap..but fine for me for the low fee.,btohqsg
China's new local Covid-19 cases hit six-week highOctober 30  2021 11:03 AMChina is battling an outbreak concentrated mainly in its northern provinces.Read more:https://bit.ly/3BzzEuI,btohqsg
So as long as in Cdp  can sell through tiger,btohqsg
Those leftover counters less than a hundred dollar still can get back some money through tiger,btohqsg
Think many of us have a bit. Sell through normal brokerage get back nothing,btohqsg
Swee...no wonder the share price of the local brokerage firms all cui.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
If approved  means all the cdp stocks can be sold thru another broker like tiger ? Even when I bought thru another one.. right?,btohqsg
But tiger more chui due to China new regulations,btohqsg
with cdp  pricing might not b able to keep as low as now..,btohqsg
Only concern is if the tiger/moomooetc can last or not? ü§î,btohqsg
But must transfer from cdp to tiger trust account first.,btohqsg
They have double whammies now... one hand facing china regulators   on the other hand US ...sandwiched in between...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇü§î,btohqsg
If the share price keeps dropping like this... how can they withstand???ü§îü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg

Last time I join AIA vitality. Enjoy the freebies. Knowing it's not substainable.After 2-3 yrs they indeed increase price and cut back the freebies.,btohqsg

I got my üçéshare this week.,btohqsg
Share price dropping affects company operation meh? I thought it's opposite.,btohqsg
It might affect their ability to get additional funding from shares,btohqsg
Only affect additional funding like what Sam said. Share price won't affect company operation.,btohqsg
