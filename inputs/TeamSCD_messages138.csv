Huh? This one logic where sia ü§£,btohqsg
I think just showing body ah,btohqsg
But oh well since we won some kind of competition then surely it would somehow boost his chances in content creation so yea,btohqsg
Wait what was the context. I can't hear sia,btohqsg
The interviewer ask if a guy is an 8 but always drives you around what would they rate him,btohqsg
One say 7 one say 8,btohqsg
"""Because he is too free and no life of his own""",btohqsg
"Another one say ""its a bit too much""",btohqsg
He's telling the whole world he's 8 inches long lol,btohqsg
0... I dont need a guy to drive me around... I can do it on my own,btohqsg
I mean such content crave attention. Been in this media & entertainment industry long enough to know who is sincere in making content and who is not,btohqsg
Using the body for fame  and first ever transgendered Ms Singapore  is to perk up their content boost. Meant no disrespect or discrimination. Just that their content isn't on the clear side,btohqsg
i'm not talking about the guy,btohqsg
