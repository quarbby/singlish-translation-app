Why you still buying Dior? 😢,btohqsg
I locked the card and disable overseas transaction etc. it doesn’t show on activity. 😬,btohqsg
Sorry does this work or it does not work even the ocbc ticks as salary deposited?,btohqsg
hi anyone knows what is the best card for miles right now? previously used amaze tgt w citi but heard it got nerfed.. any suggestions?,btohqsg
Where did u heard it got nerf?,btohqsg
What nerf are you referring to?,btohqsg
the 10x rewards.. to 1x or something.. but not sure if i heard wrong,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have both hsbc revo and the travel one card… points are Pooled but on app  I can see points earned by each card.If I were to cancel my revo  will the points remain cuz I still hold one cc (travelone) or do I need to transfer whole lot to an ffp first?,btohqsg
That’s so vague. Like what transaction? The citi card or the amaze card,btohqsg
KL Dior accepts kris+ app?AFAIK 3mpd uncapped only on Kris+appOther 3mpd only if u spend $800’oj SIA Group,btohqsg
I believe you don’t have to since they are in the same pool and you can’t choose and transfer just the points earned from revo.,btohqsg
Dont think I saw in the app,btohqsg
Amaze concerts trnx to online so it may qualify for some UOB KF online shopping mcc,btohqsg
But like Mt said  test mcc first before buying by pairing with empty wallet.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this hack!,btohqsg
You first need to clock the $800 SIA group spending first before you can qualify for the uncapped 3mp on KL Dior2nd  you need to test the Mcc code for amaze with Krisflyer UOB CC. Can try out 1$ if they allow,btohqsg
Point 1 is the most impt else it’s just 1.2mpd uncappedBut still better then other cards la especially Amex Krisflyer card since Amex card FX fees I think,btohqsg
"What I usually do is tapping my phone then ""oops sorry. What is going on?"" Then check phone check phone then take out my physical amaze and tap again 😂.",btohqsg
I use Webull to buy US stocks. If I become a non-resident of Singapore  what are the implications for my existing investments?1. Can I keep my existing investments  or will I need to sell them before I move out?2. Will I be allowed to purchase more stocks as a non-resident via Webull app?3. What are the tax implications when I sell stocks? Do I need to pay taxes on sales after becoming a non-resident?,btohqsg
Don’t think KL Dior qualify tho based on heymax MCC CodeIt excludes 5734,btohqsg
Maybe heymax is wrong and assuming that it’s from the website..? So it could really be different when tapping with amaze card at the terminal it self 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
It's 5732 to 5735 I think,btohqsg
The notes at the bottom say 5734 excluded,btohqsg
Can raise this with heymax team then,btohqsg
But on a side note…. Amaze + UOB Krisflyer really quite OP sia for super big purchases overseas.Considering that it converts to online transaction. Just that it’s a hit and missed… but then  which other cards gain big miles  on foreign currency spend with low fx rates?I doubt trust even comes close in this regards… (only 0.22% linked points return),btohqsg
Ya I use it for electronic store shopping overseas 😁,btohqsg
Let me know if I’m wrong somewhere with my thought process here 🙏,btohqsg
Ikrrr overseas tech gadget easily hit $1-2k hahaha,btohqsg
So even if the mcc code misses out  you still won’t lose cause other card also won’t gain you anything…Yet still gaining uncapped 1.2mpd,btohqsg
why not do amaze MCC check before letting the tx go through at that kind of spending?,btohqsg
You can as I pointed out above as well.Im just pointing out that it’s a win win situation because no other cards have low to no fx rates yet offer 1.2 or 3mpd uncapped on foreign spendingYoutrip don’t give any returnTrust only give 0.22% return in linked pointsAmex Krisflyer charges 3.25% but gives 2mpd uncapped ..,btohqsg
Amaze + prestige = low fx + 1.3mpd,btohqsg
Amaze + prvi master = low fx + 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Also defo not for the average people out there as it requires 120k annual income,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2024/05/30/cancelling-your-hsbc-travelone-card-getting-your-points-out-might-be-tricky/According to this article  any unused point will be forfeited 🤔 so it might not be the same as other banks  I emptied my account and cancelled both,btohqsg
Apart from the current promo on HSBC EGA that earns me 3.60% only on Incremental ADB for July and Aug  for its entirety the account will only give me 0.05% interest?? Are there frequent promotions or ways to milk the EGA further in terms of interest rate?,btohqsg
Hi would like to check if y’all usually link Apple Pay with amaze or use the amaze physical card by itself? The amaze card is linked to a Mastercard,btohqsg
Apple pay cannot link yet. Need to use physical card if no android phone,btohqsg
Just curious signing of agreement is down paymenthdb bro  is 10% of the selling price of the bto? If don't take up any loan,btohqsg
watched this vid - current promo is only for incremental ADB leh and 2 mth only. How do i do the trf in and out - isit need 2 EGA accounts?,btohqsg
Does Zym mobile have mobile app that tracks your data and roaming?,btohqsg
How's the interface and customer service support?,btohqsg
The worst is HSBC themselves can send me SMS say direct debit has been set up. Where both times DBS sent a letter stating HSBC rejected. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Hi. May I ask  if I can use my maybank platinum visa to pay for my bills to clock the 3.33%? I know that this card can use for insurance  but only can clock half of the tier on insurance. (E.g. if I wanna clock $1000 tier  I only can use $500 on insurance),btohqsg
Parents? Siblings? Grandparents? Grandchildren? Spouse? Spouse equivalent of the above?,btohqsg
As long not excluded in t&c.,btohqsg
Thanks. I didn’t see it excluding in the t&c. Mainly is only insurance. 50% to be used in insurance only.,btohqsg
Normal interface. Heard customer service not as good as others  but from my experience still ok. But I only ask simple question.,btohqsg
Hiii guys need help with credit card never use it before and need recommendation of credit card tht suit me as a first time credit card user,btohqsg
you need to provide a lot more information than that for a recommendation.like how much you expect to spend  what are you spending it on  how consistent is the spending etc,btohqsg
Any one having idea on HSBC EGA accounts in Aug and Sep? Will they keep the 4.6% interest rate promotion?,btohqsg
U wait for aug to come loh,btohqsg
Citibank credit card prone to unauthorized transactions? Just got my first unauthorized transaction just 2 months of getting the card,btohqsg
😞 so have to link amaze to the replacement card each time  and vigilant in checking Citi statement each month.,btohqsg
Sadly it is what it is. It seems fraud charges happen more often with citi,btohqsg
Will Citi don't honor the dispute? Then card holders need to bare the charges? 😰,btohqsg
So far it seems Citi handled well and usually reversed the fraud charges,btohqsg
i read somewhere someone said Maybank ninja fixed theInsuranceSnack loophole already,btohqsg
In what way fixed leh? Haha,btohqsg
InsuranceSnack won't get cashback on Maybank Visa Platinum anymore as at End June 2024 (I read from someone reputable),btohqsg
So it's a nerf not a fix ba. Cuz they are the ones who advertise on their website also,btohqsg
Really? Can show some proof? Their website still promoting itIf indeed so i will need to change my strategy ... Please do share,btohqsg
Welcome back@AdrainHoa. You came back few days ago but never say hi,btohqsg
Is this specific toward SNACK only or all insurance to Maybank visa platinum?,btohqsg
i only know what was discussed above  so definitely Snack is affected.And from my understanding Snack Mcc is insurance.*I have amended my comments to reflect that only SNACK is confirmed Nerfed. Other types of insurance is unknown.*,btohqsg
Well.. their website and tnc haven't changedLet's see how it goes then,btohqsg
Yeah. Both website and t&c haven't change. So can complain 🤪,btohqsg
Very sad. He come in don't read the instructions one 🥲,btohqsg
I was like AdrainHoa. A name that triggered many memories. 😅,btohqsg
guys can check if will earn 3mpd using UOB KF CC buying korean air on trip / expedia?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have not done a GIRO payment before and would like to know how and if it is applicable to most bills? (I'm looking to use HSBC EGA GIRO specifically)Q1: For example  I am using GIGA for my phone/data plan but I don't see any option on the interface for me to use GIRO as payment (i.e. I only saw the field to enter CC details for payment)Q2: What other bills do you guys pay using GIRO?Much thanks! 🙏,btohqsg
There are other cards that earns more miles if you're booking with them.,btohqsg
Pay your bills with CC  then pay your CC bills with HSBC EGA,btohqsg
I teach you. Use EGA to GIRO pay your credit card (DBS preferably  you will know why one day)  then just use DBS WWMC or CRMC to pay your billl normally.,btohqsg
UOB RPVI miles earns 6mpd on expedia and agoda.I do not hold this card. So I do not know the T&C for for the 6mpd rate.Usual UOB shenanigan,btohqsg
I am also not sure if you have to book through specific UOB/Expedia website or not.,btohqsg
I don't have any DBS CC cards.I currently have HSBC and StanChart credit cardsEDIT: I saw that we can pay income taxes with GIRO. Other than taxes  how do I go about paying for say my GIGA phone bill?,btohqsg
There is special uob landing page for expedia/agoda too. Price may be higher than their normal site.,btohqsg
Just make sure you double check with google flights  and triple check with the airline main website to make sure it’s same price or lower. 😅Abit effort  but can be done.It’s good for purchases that exceed the 4mpd cards like UOB Lady Travel (max limit: $2000),btohqsg
@xianzSo I should use HSBC EGA GIRO to pay for:1. My SC credit card bill2. Income taxesIs that correct? And to pay for my SC credit card bill  I have to fill in this (picture) HSBC GIRO form with my SC card details?,btohqsg
This is applying for a GIRO for a HSBC credit card  if you want to pay your SC Credit Card using GIRO  go download the form from SC instead and indicate ur EGA acct number there,btohqsg
omg  I'm so sorry. I really got confused  my bad,btohqsg
Any cheap fibre cable other than SingTel StarHub to recommend pls ?,btohqsg
I have a follow-up question on using GIRO paymentsIf let's say one day I cancel my SC credit card  will the HSBC GIRO instruction be cancelled automatically too?aka How 'smart' is this GIRO system?,btohqsg
Pardon my question  I wanted to answer all your questions  but stick out tongue when ski  not cold?Once I clear my doubt I will answer all your questions. My brother.Legit question  cause I going Hokkaido this winter  want to learn ski ⛷️ not sure if I want to use my DBS WWMC to buy some mask or no need from Taobao. 4mpd.,btohqsg
😆 giro system is smart. You have bill then it will deduct. Your card is canceled so no more bill. Nothing will be deducted. And scb should cancel that giro arrangement too.,btohqsg
I had a few cards that got fraud  but already with existing EGA giro  no idea if one should inform bank to cancel or not.I didn’t do anything. I suppose they won’t re-use the card numbers? 😅 should be safe.,btohqsg
Did you mean cancel the card or giro arrangement?,btohqsg
The card got fraud  DBS CSO replaced that card number with a new card number.But giro arrangement I didn’t inform bank  I guess it’s automagically cancelled? Or do we need to inform HSBC/DBS to cancel that giro arrangement?Anyway  I leave it as it is  never cancel since card no longer existed.,btohqsg
this depends on bank already. I recall citi will transfer giro to new replacement card but some other banks dont.,btohqsg
Not skiing when I took that pic 😂If you're only starting to learn = going to the gradual slope  (I presume there are beginner slopes at Hokkaido) = likely less windy = no need for maskBut if you have dry eyes (wearing contacts?) then better to wear mask (I believe they will rent to you at the ski place) - I think most people want to avoid the hassle of bringing own mask so they'll just rent@xianzI don't know how different places charge for the rental of items  but if you would like to bring something of your own  I think the ski gloves is likely a top choice. Your hands are one of the first places of your body to feel the freeze (and from my experience in Korea  they do charge separately for gloves rental)On the eye mask itself: Wearing it keeps the cold away but at the expense of spending $ + not able to see the 'true view/colour' with your own eyes. So probably have to weigh it that way,btohqsg
I believe DBS don’t(can’t verify though)  I did submit again a new giro form immediately.,btohqsg
do u have any examples for agoda ones?,btohqsg
Nope. I don’t dare to. Since only Expedia bonus UNI$ post immediately.,btohqsg
Hi I made booking via landing page of Expedia with my uob privi  though this time it didn't show EXPEDIAPRF like usualCalled uob and they said this has to do with Expedia and not them,btohqsg
i'll check in with uob chat then,btohqsg
Got people kenna weird stuff like this  I believe didn’t get the bonus UNI$.So there’s a risk.,btohqsg
Are you buying airticket from Expedia? If yes  which airlines?,btohqsg
Haha Thai Airways J.I suspect that photo the user never book the correct airline? 😅,btohqsg
Hi all! I have 2x 1.5k SIA tickets that i want to book. I have a DBS WWMC. Should I do a 31st & 1st booking or get a second card like UOB KF(with sign up bonus 31k miles) and use 1 card each on each ticket? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Yes. Likely not the eligible airlines.,btohqsg
I would go for sign up bonus,btohqsg
UOB CSO blur lol dk why talk until MCC,btohqsg
I actually suspect Last letter H = Hotel 🏨   F = Flight? ✈️,btohqsg
"they see ""bonus miles"" straight away default answer is ""see MCC""",btohqsg
Notch simpur also… 😅I would do flights (at same cost) but avoid hotels.,btohqsg
when booking through promo link  got option to pay later ah? i was booking through agoda/prvimiles but the option to pay later disappeared haha was told to pay upfront,btohqsg
Yes. Pay later option most likely 99.99% not eligible one la.,btohqsg
"i noticed there are another type of payment term  ""pay atcertain date"" but not at hotelwonder those counted in which category",btohqsg
but i always choose pay immediately just to avoid confusion,btohqsg

any thoughts on uob lady's savings account? currently using uob one account with uob lady's but usually can't hit $500 unless frequently dine out with friends...,btohqsg
only worth the bonus 2mpd if you can consistently spend MORE than $1k per month on UOB Lady card (ideally hit $2k cap),btohqsg
because you need to put $10 001 into UOB Lady savings account to activate the bonus 2mpd..and the $10 001 earns close to no interest  so the opportunity cost is about equal to the benefit from $1000 of spend with 2 bonus mpd (anything above is benefit)to rephrase  the TRUE BENEFIT of spending $2k on uob lady card with $10 001 stuck in lady savings = ABOUT 5mpd,btohqsg
I used UOB Evol onTrip.comto book hotel rooms  CashBack amount lower  dunno recognised as online purchase or not,btohqsg
Putting 10k in UOB lady will lose potential interest elsewhere. Once you spend above 1k (earn more than additional 2k miles) then it is worth missing out the interest.,btohqsg
wait  must it be $10 001? or $10 000 is ok also,btohqsg
10 001 for the insurance higher tierand i don't like to be JUST EXACTLY type... have a bit of buffer also ok,btohqsg
insurance higher tier? oh you mean the complimentary coverage for women right? that's not applicable to me since im a guy haha,btohqsg
who knows.. tomorrow they have prostate cancer coverage?,btohqsg
haha errr.. quite unlikely unless they also change the name of the savings account lol,btohqsg
last i checkedUOB Lady Card is still called UOB Lady Cardand you have one no?Also  I am sure there are Ladies in this chat too... so 10 001 would be a better recommendation with no downside (err. yeah... the $1...),btohqsg
yah of course i do. i'm just saying they're not likely to introduce male - specific insurance coverage for an account that is primarily targeted at women even though they have now opened it to men,btohqsg
and i'm also just saying it's not applicable to me lol. not saying there's anything wrong with recommending to put the extra $1. if you're a girl  of course put 10 001. if you're a guy  it makes no difference cos the insurance coverage doesn't apply to us anws,btohqsg
one more consideration which i didn't want to say earlier incase accused of FUDthere are people who put $10 000 and didn't get the bonus mpd. Reason still unknown (although appeals were granted  but troublesome).MAYBE.. just MAYBE  the programming on the bonus miles is 10 000.01? i dunno,btohqsg
thanks for highlighting - i better go double-check my miles accrual lol,btohqsg
i'm just being kiasu and kiasi...which i find in the long run  much better for all the promos and all that.. no worries about missing out or not getting due to slight miscalculation and all that.like i highly discourage JUST IN TIME style... last day participate or last day do promotions,btohqsg
Hi all  for the EGA June promo tncs  if I interpret correctly  adding additional funds in mid July still qualify for the additional bonus interests  is this correct? Or I better park the funds elsewhere and wait for Aug promo?,btohqsg
to be clear  which is your cycle?June registration or July registration?,btohqsg
June registrationBut I plan to move some funds into EGA mid July after they matures,btohqsg
June registration means Reference Month = May 2024So you will earn:June ADB3.x% of incremental balance on top of May ADB1% of incremental balance on top of May ADBJuly ADB3.x% of incremental balance on top of May ADB1% of incremental balance on top of JUNE ADBso you see if worth or not loh,btohqsg
Got it. Since my FDs mature mid this month  I’ll probably need to park it either with EGA or other banks and wait for Aug promo. Since bank promos some are better than FD rates.,btohqsg
May i know if apply for more credit card will bring down credit bureau rating?,btohqsg
Does not work  my tracker showed salary deposited but I did not get the salary bonus. Many people also reported the same in another group. So don't waste your 100k in ocbc 360,btohqsg
I read it must be from a corporate account. If its from other name  there will not be salary interest,btohqsg
Yeah only genuine salary credit for ocbc 360,btohqsg
If u always pay on time  I don't see any reason why it will affectPersonally  I've at some points had 10 cards but my credit rating still AAAbout 16 cards in the history since 2020,btohqsg
Who transferred the salary to you?,btohqsg
Not sure if family members is the reason. I saw a lot of use case that even spouse that transferred did not qualify. The ones I know successful are from friend’s account. So is not that it does not work  we just dunno the exact details of how they track what is a salary,btohqsg
I have 2 accounts . did the same steps across both (different name transfer SAL). Salary tracker move for both . One get one never get 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
For cards with minimum spend  can I check if non-eligible cashback/mile spend are counted towards the minimum spend?,btohqsg
the card TnC will have stated what is counted to minimum spend,btohqsg
Any opinions about chocolate finance? I just started my account,btohqsg
Why U think this way? U got cheated?,btohqsg
Yeah  not sure how ocbc system works. Don't want to risk another month without salary bonus.,btohqsg
Do elaborate your point as such allegations are frowned upon,btohqsg
Even Chris is taking about it. Are u trying to say he is part of the scheme? It is a very big accusation.,btohqsg
Usually they will automatically apply to the new card.,btohqsg
Nothing new from them la 🤣,btohqsg
When did you apply for the card? After the nerf announced?,btohqsg
"Seems like more and more dp of them fixing the ""bug""",btohqsg
Depends on the card. Check the t&c tl be sure. Example is DBS Live Fresh counts  UOB EVOL don't count.,btohqsg
lol   saying something without sources to back you up,btohqsg
Hmm I think it’s more like we don’t really know the exact criteria they take in. I would say it’s a risk but if one alrd have the account then why not,btohqsg
He’s a crypto bro  he’s traumatized by the word “interests”,btohqsg
Technically I wouldn’t call CF give you interest,btohqsg
Had it for some time already. Nerf takes effect from Aug. Mine was for last month. Purchase fromTrip.comwas $1.8k  surely fulfilled. Touchless also. But dunno why got less than $40...,btohqsg
Your transaction posted forTrip.comand $250 of contactless spend?,btohqsg
Guess this month will be last month for Evol,btohqsg
So your spend was in May statement month?,btohqsg
can use card up to clock the min spend for this?,btohqsg
What does the t&c say? Is CardUp excluded?,btohqsg
rather put my millions in bank account earning 0% interest,btohqsg
So far so good. I withdraw my earnings almost every week and its alw instant.,btohqsg
How to find the Best Credit Card to use with Dobinhttps://youtu.be/Nkg_X7_hG6Y,btohqsg
"I made 2 overseas purchases with my Amaze card  but Global Blue couldn't process the tax refund to it. So I routed the refund to my Amex Ascend card. To my horror  Amex deducted miles + bonus miles for foreign spend for the refund amount  even though it wasn't the original payment method. Amex cs said it's their ""predefined process"" and ""can't be changed"". Anybody kena this before? Is this standard with other credit cards too?",btohqsg
Bros. I need help here.I would like to check.  For oversea amex marriott bonvy card  as us foreigners able to apply ?,btohqsg
Seems normal by logic. Their t&c did state that refunds will be excluded from miles rewards. Be it if it's the original payment methods or not.,btohqsg
Damn.. such an unfair practice since they didn't award those miles in the first place zzzz I went with Amex for refunds cos they don't incur DCC charges. What cards do you guys usually use for tax refunds that don't incur DCC charges?,btohqsg
Using a burner telegram account to conduct slander? Pretty low blow,btohqsg
Usually.... May not happen also 😅,btohqsg
So usually...... Flip a coin and find out?,btohqsg
Don't think need to flip a coin.. usually they will send letter stating GIRO is rearranged for you.,btohqsg
Always best to tax refund to debit card,btohqsg
Agree! But some  like Global Blue  don't process tax refunds to debit cards  only to credit cards or cash refunds (if their counters are open),btohqsg
Then take cash refund is your next best bet,btohqsg
Would have went that route.. but their counters were closed  so could only clear tax refund checks and submit the forms via their postbox,btohqsg
Which Global Blue took almost a month to process 😅,btohqsg
hello which credit card should i get if i want to spend on air ticket/overseas accoms and expenses  but am not confident of hitting any minimum spend in the long term?im open to both miles and cashback,btohqsg
I'm trying to consolidate a comparison for this actually but not ready yet hahahaBut as of now  I believe for air ticket  miles  you can look atthisIn general (flight and oversea expense)  you can probably take reference tothis,btohqsg
How is this compared to Heymax? :),btohqsg
Hi if i cancel the hsbc travel one card they will still charge me the annual fee？,btohqsg

I have to add miles accumulation itself is a long term commitment.,btohqsg
did u get miles for the card u linked to amaze? or you used amaze wallet for payment?,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Oversea usage . Better to use citi rewards with Amaze card. Because it is so much useful for oversea.  Almost all can be use. Except travel.,btohqsg
right...then i guess cashback ccs will be more useful for me then,btohqsg
It's quite clear in the TnC that you need to pay annual fee.,btohqsg
Yes agree.. then have another back up for revoult oversea ATM withdrawl up to sgd 300,btohqsg
Yep. Consider any cards that you can get new to bank status. Spend and claim rewards.,btohqsg
No other choice. We want to avoid fx charges by bank impose on credit card. Best person to check with is ask Admin in here.,btohqsg
should actually pairAmaze + UOB Lady to tackle $2k on the big categories like Dining or Hotel or Groceries depending on what you pickTHENwhatever UOB Lady cannot take  then put onto Amaze + CRMC (don't waste the precious $1000 quota),btohqsg
Bro. This only applies to uob lady solitaire right. If the normal one I think is only cap at 1k ?,btohqsg
I think best person to check with is Admin. Cause later say wrong again. Get ban...,btohqsg
No one gets banned cuz saying wrong things. I got things wrong too 😞.,btohqsg

Then you more satki than me already.,btohqsg
Yes  as long as you fulfill the T&Cs,btohqsg
I thought Derick teach you how to hit the spending already? You never listen?,btohqsg
You got banned from amex plat chat  so fast forget liao?,btohqsg
Why I need to remember those people...,btohqsg
They are not forgiving.. if you are wrong .. they should pm me  then I apologise.  Not ban me without know what's wrong,btohqsg
That's why I back here.. anything don't know. Ask admin is the best..,btohqsg
To me what's the point .. you force yourself to hit 8k just to get amex points. But end up u in amex debts...,btohqsg
Hi all  i am new here. I have a qn on  chocolate finance. How to ensure the security feature on logging into the app? I am android user.

And if i lose my phone  then how..any idea how to keep the acct secure?,btohqsg
You’re using android and afraid of security 🤔Even if they see your phone number they can’t exactly login without going through hoops. Else if you are really that worried  get a spare phone and install that app and don’t bring that phone out,btohqsg

Hi guys… I’ve just applied for the HSBC T1 card and gotten email that it’s been approved. How do I pay for the annual fee so that I can qualify for the sign up bonus?,btohqsg
If I remember correctly the AF should be charged after 1Month or so.Just remember to clock the spendings within the period to qualify for the bonus,btohqsg
For me it is charge on the 3rd month,btohqsg

Hi Experts! Sorry to ask for advise again.i am trying to work out how i can maximise the ega account across two humans.Since we cant transfer more than 200k in a single day  its not quite possible to adjust the ADB at day1. Can effectively put more than 360k on most days to eventually get the 360k ADB at the end?Can this example work?Day 1 200kDay 2 to 370k (29days)ADB = 364k.Next month transfer on day1 to human B account (via outside bank acct)  im same fashion and also get 364k ADB for that month? And human A acct would be ~5k ADB becos of 170k on day1?,btohqsg
Just use excel to calculate on a daily basis. Better than using your current calculation. Because there will always be days u have movement in/out. I’m sure u have giro too.As long as your excel ends up with approx $360k adb is fine.And I’ll start moving out on second last day and last day.,btohqsg
Hi  I juz sign up for dobin . After checking for my next purchase on sia   I realize it doesn't reflect on the app that uob ladies is giving 4 mpd when I already selected travel as my selected category. Any idea if I have to select travel again on the app ?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know how the calculation for HSBC ADB? What's the difference for MAB and ADB? Will be same method?,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing so nicely! Learnt something here👍👍Mind sharing also which bank to park for the last 2 days and 1st day? Scb?,btohqsg
Yes I’m using scb saver which also has 3.x% bonus interest so there is minimal interest loss on transfer days.Just watch your esaver terms properly.I’m using the ones on special invite which pay on entire balance without caring about incremental.,btohqsg
for overseas spend in Malaysia (not driving)  For MasterCards  i have HSBC TravelOne (just got it last week) and UOB KrisFlyer.Which is better to link Amaze with?per milelion review of the cardThere is also the option of pairing the HSBC TravelOne Card with Amaze in order to enjoy better conversion rates  but you’ll earn 1.2 mpd instead of 2.4 mpd in that case since transactions will be converted into SGD.,btohqsg
U may want to consider using Maybank family and friends naked in Malaysia. 8% cashback on ringgit spend.,btohqsg
i'm leaving this Sunday for co. trip and i don't visit Malaysia frequentlyi do have DCS Ultimate Platinum MasterCard,btohqsg
If you have to choose between the two  then UOB KF. You will get some 3mpd for dining  shopping  taxi  etc. while the rest is 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Probably close to 1 year ago. But I did just open a new maybank acc for refinance purposes. I believe they gave me a debit card not a credit one,btohqsg
Hi All  i'm new here. May i ask what is the best cashback card for wedding expenses? (photo shoot  bridal gown rental  banquet/wedding buffet  car rental  home reno),btohqsg
Uob lady and platinum visa. Which card is good for dinning?,btohqsg
Does that mean that I need to fund $1500 and complete 7 buy trades to get both grab and alibaba shares?,btohqsg
You can try doing a search first but not sure if there's an answer for you,btohqsg
If the amount is big you may want to consider going for miles imho,btohqsg
Ya there is a mix view between cash rebate n miles. Sum of expense I’m looking at would likely be 20-40k in the next 6mths,btohqsg
For that amount  cashback cards may not be able to fully maximize rewards. UOB one is the standout one. There are more 4mpd cards that can be used for wedding expenses.,btohqsg
Bro admin.What's your opinion on amex platinum charge card.If I had max out 1k for citi rewards out . Should I use remaining let's say 800$  for amex platinum charge card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks I will do some research on that card,btohqsg
I think probably can get business class tickets liao for,btohqsg
Oh. I’m not a frequent credit card user haha but because of this big cash layout so decided to see what I can get.,btohqsg
Uob one I think max is like 1k or is it 2k per month for one quarter. Still super short of your expected spending.,btohqsg
Only $200 per quarter for 6k spending. However I am just as noob.,btohqsg
This is more realistic than amex platinum charge card.  Spend 6000 to 8000 depends on monthly promotions must be paid within 2 months . Or else interest be charge.,btohqsg
I guess some things never change,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask what’s the current credit card that has the best perk for pumping petrol @ shell?,btohqsg
Ya uob one needs to spend consistently on a quarter. Max is 2k and you have 2 players so 4k a month. Meanwhile  miles card have like UOB lady dining/travel (1-2k) UOB preferred PV (1.1k) and UOB visa sig (2k). And another set of cards from your wife.,btohqsg
Still cashback is better if u dont intend to play miles game after this 1 time spend.,btohqsg
Hello may I ask if uob lady could be use to get 4mpd for MRT  or Bus via apple pay if selected category for traveling and sum up apple pay total cost more than $5?,btohqsg
I not sure. Bro. That'd why I ask can I use remaining balance on amex platinum charge card.  Since already max out bonus cap 1k citi rewards card.,btohqsg
Hi. May i ask. Which bank has the highest FD interest now?,btohqsg
Just google it  there will be breakdown different tenure and rate,btohqsg

Guys . I have a question need advise here.Let's say in order to hit welcome bonus of amex platinum charge card  of 8000 spend for 2 months. I go buy Gold jewellery... before Sept end to meet qualifying spend . Will I able to sell back to maxi cash to get back capital of 8k,btohqsg
Thanks for replying bro... then makes it no point to go for it... I told in the other group amex . .. I not willing to spend that 8k to go for welcome bonus... they disagree. When I say that if I do it... I may end up in credit card debts unable to pay back 8k to bank...,btohqsg
When I explain my reasons . They ban me,btohqsg
If I not wrong in US. Welcome bonus can be spread out in 6 months to achieve spending. Here is really too much. Instead of 6k increase to 8k sgd.,btohqsg
And here we go again 🤦🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
Just cancel the card already. No point forcing yourself to spend,btohqsg
You mean you also have this card and you cancel it .?,btohqsg
Have you considered moving to US to get an AMEX card with welcome bonus that can be spread out to 6 months for spending?,btohqsg

Let me correct you ah  you said your purpose of getting the card is to get Marriott Gold. That’s why people said it’s not wise. 😂Mind you it’s $1744 to get Marriott gold,btohqsg
buy gold and sell back usually lose money unless gold price rocketed between the period u buy and sell  because they mark up during sales  but buy back based on the raw gold price. 2 months gold price won't rocket as much.  2 years maybe,btohqsg
Yes... that's also my reason explaining.  I want to get enrolment for marriott elite gold,btohqsg
I will pay 1744 annual fee. But not 8000 welcome bonus... I worry I end up credit card debts,btohqsg
You’re playing music for a buffalo… or come join me sitback relax grab a popcorn n’ enjoy,btohqsg

Is Amaze Spread 3% off spot now? Noticed many people getting this rate now,btohqsg
I just got 3.3% off but i thought that’s because it was an exotic currency.,btohqsg
I thought people said it was a 2% spread,btohqsg
My experience is amaze is 2% off master card rate. Then mastercard rate against spot varies,btohqsg
It’s probably 2% off it’s one of the majors.,btohqsg
Exotic currency do get worst rate compare to mainstream currency due to trading volume i guess,btohqsg
Just like how u go money changer and those less in demand currency spread is bigger,btohqsg
Oh  so it wasn't Amaze that increase the spot rate but mastercard then?,btohqsg
Is JPY considered exotic currency? I recently saw a youtuber get a spot rate of 3%,btohqsg
Definitely no. Jpy is the top few trading pairs in fx.,btohqsg
I got 2.2% above spot for AUD yesterday.,btohqsg
Isn't JPY more popular than AUD,btohqsg
Amaze total cost =Amaze spread (usually 1.8%)+Mastercard spread (usually 0.8%)However Mastercard rates don’t update live. So if spot jumps up or down. The usual 0.8% Mastercard markup might appear to be 0.5% or 1.5% for example. This is the moving part when u compare against spot rate.,btohqsg

Link your wechat or alipay to amaze/youtrip or ichange card. Their fx better. Below 200 rmb per trans  there is no 3% mark up from these 2 platforms.,btohqsg
Thanks! For Alipay  do we need China local mobile number for registration? I think for WeChat probably need local number to activate the pay function.,btohqsg
Both you can register using sg numbers and verify account using sg passport.If you want to activate the hongnao function to receive money then you need chinese ID to do so.,btohqsg
Got it! Thanks so much! 🙏,btohqsg
Yes  as long as recipient not reached FRS,btohqsg

Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Makes sense. They force all card top-ups to levy fee  most people opt to just top-up via PayNow.,btohqsg
Mytrip have a high amount of bad reviews  especially comes to refunds. No office in SG also. 👀,btohqsg
Hi Chris. Able to elaborate more on step 4:how to issue $8 premiums?I thought I knew but I keep facing issues trying to link my amaze or Uob lady card (keep saying invalid card number),btohqsg
Not by me but another contributor:Investment > Single top-up > Click build your coverage and a % portion of it will fulfill the premiums,btohqsg
Have to link visa card somehow  i try a few mastercard cant link,btohqsg
Thanks queenie. I was guessing as such but seems all my easily used cards are master. Hahaha.Will link Uob one card then,btohqsg
What i did was use the nominated card for snack to top up ezlink wallet since ezlink wallet have spending campaign now (up to 10 percent cashback). Need to open your lifestyle activites top up premium option and increase your weekly cap.,btohqsg
I might just topup Starbucks card since it’s 5814 under food category. Nominate HSBC live+ visa,btohqsg
U need to top up alot of time  per transaction max 70 cent top up to premium  so i find ezlink the easiest for now for me haha. 8 dollar u need to do at least 12 time,btohqsg
Wah so this first step is really quite pain in the S,btohqsg
Can set for critical   accident and lifeThen is $2.1 per transaction,btohqsg
Can also but still need 4 times  i only qualify for accident that why,btohqsg
Ezlink i can do at my own time own target. Go store do mutiple time get the stare from staff haha,btohqsg
There will be time when snack decide to play punk and the spending dont count,btohqsg
The mcc of the visa spend must match the activity set right. That’s damn irritating,btohqsg
Can’t they just let us pay $8 premium directly. So stupid,btohqsg
Let’s nerf everything left for Snack. Maybank was just a first step 😂,btohqsg
Nothing much is left to be honest to get from snack premium using cc,btohqsg
Ezlink Spend exclude mcc 4111 and 6300  correct?,btohqsg
I am talking about using link card in snack to top up ezlink wallet to move the premium counter. Not talking about using ezlink wallet card to spend for snack.,btohqsg
Although i already have plan on what can be spend for the 600 ezlink campaign (up to 10 percent cashback),btohqsg
Hi  any suggestion best way (cheapest and best exchange rate) to transfer USD to local USD bank account (I think it's HSBC)?  Thanks.,btohqsg
What’s the difference between Life and Investment category? If I only turn on Investment  will the $8 go into Asia income fund? Instead of wasted in life insurance?,btohqsg
U have to do insurance  i tried investment and it din work,btohqsg
What’s most hilarious is if after so many years when Amaze is finally compatible with Apple Pay  then Citi nerf CRMC + Amaze 😂,btohqsg
But i think need to do due diligence. If i remember correctly the fund it buys includes China,btohqsg
The Best Cash Savings Strategy for 3Q 2024 is brokenhttps://youtu.be/5az40Y0qWKs,btohqsg

not sure who stands to lose moreCiti or Instarem lol  probably the latter,btohqsg
Yeah the $8 throw away into insurance premiums sounds bad.,btohqsg
Bro . Where you get this info. Citi rewards card no more can pair with amaze ??,btohqsg
Pray pray 🙏 don’t let this Apple Pay happen.,btohqsg
Is this your conjecture or are you sure that's gonna happen?,btohqsg
Hi All Seeking yours suggestion/ view.I currently own UOB One Account for the interest rate  still trying to reach $150k after UOB raised from $100k~$150k.Monthly expenses usually $700~800.After reached my min spending of $500 on UOB One Account  I feel I those money beyond that spent could be in better use.e.g Miles  since my wife like to travel. So with mile accumulated  could lighten my expenses also. But planning for babyMy Daily Expenses:- Food Junction (using Online payment) to fund BreadTalk apps- Koptiam (payment via Ntuc apps  linked with Trust card)- Ntuc (in-store)- Bakery e.g BreadTalk/ Toastbox / Swee Heng (in-store)Once per month Expense- very seldom will take Grab/ Taxi- Once 2~3 months  Food Panda/ Grab food etc- Restaurant (dine-in) at time with wife/ friends (e.g 2~3 times per month)- Redmart (groceries)   once every month- Shopee/ Lazada (e.g 2~3 months once per month e.g supplements)I narrowed to :- DBS Words card- OCBC 90N- UOB Prvi Miles- UOB Kris Flyer Credit Card- UOB Preferred Platinum**Let me know if you have other cards to suggest too.- I eyed on OCBC 90  cause its non expired and could use anywhere without thinking much. And no limit to cap. E.g buying air ticket and hotel (exceeding $2k limited for miles)- DBS Woman card  has only 1 year expiry. Mean if my wife get pregnant  3 years unable to travel  Points are all wasted? and if purchase ticket and hotel  might exceed $1 500 limit (unless separate on different month)But not sure if I am on the right track  nor have friends whom so proactive in saving and accumulate mile. Looking forward for your opinions or other suggestion too. Thanks all.,btohqsg
I thought you are in ML chat? Somebody posted the upcoming changes on Amaze over there.,btohqsg
Didnt see any update pertaining to 1% on all SGD transactions  thus I'm asking.,btohqsg
This is why I'm afraid that satire might be misinterpreted as gospel at times...,btohqsg
Really? Thanks god it is a joke. Phew.,btohqsg
Uob prefer platinum sound good except it work in 5 dollar block (online travel excluded) One of the more popular choice now is citi reward plus amaze (travel cat excluded) if u like everything in uob eco system can try uob privi or uob lady (with travel cat),btohqsg
Didnt read your wall of text fully but I can give input on Woman's World Card (WWMC). Dont worry about the 1 year validity of the points. Just transfer all points to KF miles by the 12th month and the validity of the miles becomes 36 months from that day on.,btohqsg
Can someone help me with this? I have a Citi Rewards credit card linked with Amaze  and I'm trying to collect miles. I understand that the miles can only be collected on up to $1000 of spending.My question is: if I spend $600 on an air ticket (which doesn't count towards miles) and $400 on groceries  can I still spend another $600 on eligible purchases to collect miles?,btohqsg
Yes if it is not in the bonus cat  but why do u want to spend the 600 on airticket  can always use another card. U only get base 0.4mpd for travel cat,btohqsg
nvm forgot it's Air ticket  not eligible for Citi Rewards bonuswhy use Citi Rewards for Travel?,btohqsg
I just want to knowJust for my future reference,btohqsg
Which card would you recommend if my Citi Reward Card reach to 1000$,btohqsg
Really depend on your spending habit  u can have citi reward for non travel spending and uob lady travel cat for travel spending,btohqsg
I don't know should I say this . I believe for amex platinum charge card holders will use this 200 $ air ticket credit for air flight with krisflyer.,btohqsg
You can check at amex webpage. As previously chris told me not to share 3rd party link,btohqsg
Based on this  If I subscribe now  Will I start to receive daily return from tomorrow? Or have to wait til monday (Business Day),btohqsg
Best to subscribe on monday early morning  weekend no returns,btohqsg

Are you trying to be the group chat's dictionary?,btohqsg
No... I better don't talk too much,btohqsg
Any pros and cons insurance savings plan vs ssb?,btohqsg
No one's stopping you from talking  just say things that are factual and relevant to the topic,btohqsg
Insurance savings plan has very low returnsThe first two years premium goes to paying commission ... So ... GG,btohqsg
The agent telling me normally around 3+% pa,btohqsg
You get way better returns outside of endowments. And are equally  if not safer.,btohqsg
That’s what they tell you  but to actually break even  takes quite a while,btohqsg
Not really.  Previously if you buy traditional ntuc saving plan . You can get good return up to 5%. Until recently MAS put a cap on return yield of 4.8%,btohqsg
"So right now is it previously or now? And I'm pretty sure you meant ""projected"" and not guaranteed.",btohqsg
If u go around and ask ... I don't think anyone has achieved that ... likely is around 2-3%,btohqsg
No one will look at the up to %. Everywhere can state up to how many % but if it can’t reach what’s the point.,btohqsg
Now is just average. I bought a retired plan manulife as back up .. if my stocks fail... I almost fail as my stock raffles medical keep going down to 1.0,btohqsg
Does it means ssb better than insurance savings plan?,btohqsg
Let ssb do your money growing....Do look at tBills..... ssb .... reits.... Stocks...,btohqsg
Not a financial advisor/consultant so its not ethical to give an absolute answer on their behalf. But you can kinda infer based on the above and your own research,btohqsg
What card are you using? Got rebate/reward for this topup?,btohqsg
I just use any card that i have ega set up,btohqsg
Hi terry why u ignore me. I said hi to u ;(,btohqsg
Oh. For that 1% Cashback uh?,btohqsg
Get your agent to send you the BI  look at your premiums paid and the GUARANTEED column. See how long it takes for you to break even.Factor in that you need to pay continuously and if you early surrender you usually won’t get back what you put in.PS  not a financial advise. Do your own due diligence,btohqsg

Want to ask  is it better to book a scoot flight using1. UOB lady's card through heymax ontrip.com(this method can't enter krisflyer ID and earn krisflyer miles?)2. Directly through scoot website using UOB Krisflyer CC,btohqsg
What is the Main objective of choosing/comparing between the two? More miles or cheaper ticket? Is the price the same in both website? Is the additional scoot benefit from UOBKF important to you?,btohqsg
Main objective is to earn more miles. Prices are almost the same and the additional benefit from UOBKF don't matter to me.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to ask  can I pay my SingTel bill via the SingTel apps using Citi rewards card and earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
You need to factor in if you can earn Krisflyer miles from flying scoot. Earning Krisflyer miles(not from credit card but from airlines) from flying scoot with ticket viaTrip.comis not guaranteed. Sometimes have some time don’t have. So it is a comparison between:1). credit card miles(Lady) + Airline miles(non guaranteed).2). Credit card(UOBKF) + Airline(guaranteed)Do you sum n factor in risk then make a decision.,btohqsg
Hello I tried to transfer from dbs to ocbc via fast and put SALA in the comments but ocbc doesn't recognise as salary credit  anyone knows how to make it work?,btohqsg
A lot of mixed dp regarding this. So if you don’t want to risk it get your HR to change your crediting bank.What I know works is transferring from another bank from another name but do it at your own risk.How do you know it doesn’t recognise?,btohqsg
Because salary interest was not credited,btohqsg
You did a fast transfer from dbs and put in comments instead of selecting the salary option?It’s not ocbc not consistent. It’s no one know exactly the criteria to self transfer. It’s a fine line between,btohqsg
I see. I selected the salary option and also put in comments SALA and also transfer it via fast. But maybe I'm using the app so it doesn't work?,btohqsg
App works. You xfer from your own account right?,btohqsg

Usually 90-120 days for singsaver. I am not sure which promotional link you applied the credit card through  but it’s either singsaver gift OR hsbc gift. The type of gift is driven by the unique link you start off with when applying for credit card. Just that outside of bank’s  singsaver requires you to input the redemption form for tracking and selection of reward.,btohqsg

Hi Guys My OCBC 360 acct has met the criteria of Salary bonus in June. From the online banking website under my 360 acct page  it also reflects there was $1800 salary credited. This amount was credited via Fast transfer under Salary mode with comment “SAL”.However  I DO NOT receive the Salary Bonus  and only receive Save bonus on 9thJul.Anyone has encountered above issue? Thank you for ur advise.🙏,btohqsg
They from the start don't even support AMEX. And no rewards for top-up anyway.,btohqsg
yea  guess they patched the loophole,btohqsg
utilities i.e. SP excluded. M1 should get 5% if pay on M1 website/app,btohqsg
Seems like so. So many dps this month points to not working liaos.,btohqsg
U can call their customer service and ask.,btohqsg
I'd not advise this unless it was genuine salary transfer. Ocbc may request OP to show proof of salary like payslip.,btohqsg
Can Call. And later tio ban for gaming the system. 😂,btohqsg

No official announcement yet though. They are just teasing us.,btohqsg
Just to share an unpleasant experience with UOB recently.Have UOB one account and debit card with them.The bank have deducted the wrong amount instructed by merchant .Spoken to customer service officers and they want me to reach out to the merchant to obtain the conversation and send back to them for investigation  this will take a long process.Advised them to liaise directly with the merchant but was rejected and claimed that it’s the client who authorised the deduction.The officer also mentioned that the bank will deduct the amount by the merchant as long as the authorisation is given. Think there is a serious lapse here as the merchant may authorise the wrong amount.Also why the “fault” is on the client and shouldn’t the bank provide the service of liaising with the bank.Just an experience to share and hope everyone exercise more caution when using your debit card.,btohqsg
Updated post woth tnc  but did not state the fulfilment time,btohqsg
Ouch. That's why credit card is always safer.,btohqsg
Yup  good lesson learnt  also intend to close account with UOB and switch to OCBC since they provide a poor. customer service,btohqsg
Wait till u experience ocbc customer service,btohqsg
My experience with ocbc wasn't that great 😃,btohqsg
No  unless they changed. Initially applied for a sub card for my wife. Her spending tracked down but not fulfilling the $500 spending UOB One Account,btohqsg
Oh  cash back  not the 500 spending,btohqsg
should fulfil 500 card spend of main card holder,btohqsg
Confirm plus chop.OCBC is the worst. Even though it has an outlet in my Fujian hometown.They reject me so many times saying I never meet $30k annual salary. So frustrating.,btohqsg

Standard reply: We will get back to you in 3-4 working days.,btohqsg
Actually my greatest concern is why the bank did not verify with the clients b4 making the deduction? If there an error in the deduction  shouldn’t the bank be also held responsible and contact the merchant. It will be also easier for them to liaise with the merchant rather than client- merchant- client- bank- merchant- client.,btohqsg
Wait. Who made mistake? Did client ask for correct amt but bank deducted wrong? Or client asked for wrong amt and bank deducted that amount?,btohqsg
How is the bank supposed to know what is the correct and wrong amount to deduct?,btohqsg
If the amt merchant quote to you is different from what they instruct the bank to deduct then you have to go settle with the merchant,btohqsg
If is newly card you applied. They will activate you.. I spend last thursday 30 using amex charge card... I call up ask why can't go through for payment . Lucky got my amaze card for payment... customer service say my card not activated.. Friday I try again. It went through 18$ spent at halal restaurant,btohqsg
That means they can deduct any amount sent by the merchant? Also  can’t  they deduct the amount after the client has received from the merchant??,btohqsg
That’s mean the bank just collect the amount happily even though there is an error made by merchant? and the client has to clean up the mess?,btohqsg
If you r from UOB  would v much appreciate if  you can feedback this lapses to your higher authority so that the client would not have gone through the same experience as me🙏,btohqsg
When you hand your debit card to the merchant to make purchase  did you check the amount? Did the merchant give you a invoice or receipt?,btohqsg
That's what I am thinking too. If there's a receipt or invoice then can just show the bank the discrepancies.,btohqsg
I find this detail missing from your description. And No  I am not from UOB,btohqsg
The bank only provide the platform for the merchant to hold and receive the money.It is still up to the client to verify if the amount is correct  and if not  the client has to settle with the merchant to provide refund.,btohqsg
No receipt from the merchant at the point of deduction and the amount  and thought it’s a fraudulent transaction .,btohqsg
Then the bank believe who? If merchant say 100  you say 90. That's why you need to resolve it with merchant. And I'm not from uob,btohqsg
Did you not see the amount before tapping your card to make the transaction?,btohqsg
Are u also from UOB? yes  pls kindly communicate to your higher authority to save the trouble from the client. Thanks.,btohqsg
Didn’t know we have so many people from UOB all of a sudden,btohqsg
LOL just because ppl don't side your story everyone is from uob. Maybe you are the bad experience,btohqsg
Its best to verify the payment amount before authorising the payment. Else its like signing a blank cheque,btohqsg
I think people are trying to explain how the bank works. Your reply isn't helpful. And tbh  someone from uob may not side with UOB. I know many hate their job but no choice. 🥲,btohqsg
Can’t the bank wait for the receipt? So u also  implying the bank can’t make mistake  but the clients do?,btohqsg
Maybe you can apply for a job at the bank to change the policy. If you can't accept the way it works as explained.,btohqsg
Sounds like u basically hand the debit card over without verifying the amount. U know u can always request for a invoice or receipt right?,btohqsg
Yup  but they may be from other banks  just hope that the rights of the client to be protected and also the bank should hold the responsibility and be more willing to help rather than telling the client is the procedure and let them clear the mess.,btohqsg
Doesn’t it work like this - When you make the payment  you have already authorised the transaction? So how can it be the bank or merchant fault if you already make the payment,btohqsg
Sounds like a user skill issue here,btohqsg
No  the amount sent in  is correct but the amt deducted is wrong.,btohqsg
Why would it be the bank's issue if the client approved the transaction? It is a transaction between the client and the merchant. If the amount deviates from the invoice/receipt  and the merchant refuses to refund the difference  report it to the police as fraudulent transaction.,btohqsg
Yes I think you are right  it's the bank fault. You should change bank. Or best is to just pay cash and don't use any bank,btohqsg
U right to see I have authorised but the amt deducted is wrong. So the mistake is by the merchant and not the bank??,btohqsg
Yes you should be disputing the merchant not the bank  the merchant is telling how much to deduct from the bank,btohqsg
Sound so funny.  Probably some hacker hijacked the transaction and changed the amount. 😂,btohqsg
The tricky part is you not keeping the receipt. What if the merchant acts dumb? 🙃,btohqsg
If I use ShopBack but pay using Apple Pay does it considered mobile payment or online,btohqsg
Hi all  thanks  for all the comments and feedback.Think  we will stop the discussion for the benefit of the other users. It’s a good lesson learnt for me and just hope that those who r in the banking sector in the group to look at this lapses seriously and be more innovative in resolving it.?This will definitely protect the interest of the clients🙏,btohqsg
And always ask for receipt or invoice to verify your purchase please!,btohqsg
What if it's client skill issue?,btohqsg
This “lapse” does not seem to be an issue that it’s the bank’s fault,btohqsg

No. Need to be same name.,btohqsg
HiFor EGA promotion - for how long this 4.6% will last ? Only for one month worth of interest ? And   is there any cap for it can I put any amount?,btohqsg
Hi  i remember watching a video about supercharging the cpf oa. But i couldn’t find the video again. Does anyone have the link?Its has the most updated information after the shielding update?,btohqsg
Supercharging OA in short just means hitting BHS (MA) and FRS (SA). So that any contributions to MA will go straight to OA.,btohqsg
And any interest on the MA & SA will go to the OA immediately right?  And since interest rate is much higher in MA & SA  it will benefit the OA much much more,btohqsg
And another thing. Do we need to keep topping up the MA and SA even after maxing it out? How much is the yearly increase for the FHS?,btohqsg
MA*. SA interest and contributions stay in SA.,btohqsg
You cannot. What do you mean FHS?,btohqsg
If u talking about July-August promo  4.6 is only for July while 3.6 is for August as the additional 1% is for everyday rewards which compare to previous month. Cap is maximum incremental deposit ADB 3 million as per TNC,btohqsg
Ok. Meaning even after the FRS is fulfilled  the interest won’t go into OA?,btohqsg
Typically 3-4%. Unlikely you can do RSTU once you hit FRS since interest is usually higher than limit. But if there's a slight chance the limit increases beyond the interest for that year  then yes.,btohqsg
Yes. Only MA interest will go OA.,btohqsg
So it is largely unlikely that the interest in SA will go to the OA due to the yearly limit increase,btohqsg
Wrong. Like I said earlier  SA interests and contributions will stay in SA. Unlikely you can do RSTU once you hit FRS.,btohqsg
Hi there! Anyone know which are the best places to park USD Funds without lock in right now? TqSo far…MooMoo/WeBull: 5.18%IBRK: 4.347% (100K USD),btohqsg
I think the current situation is unclear so people don’t get the full picture.Maybe u can describe the whole situation again clearly so we get the full picture. So far people here are generally neutral and do not side or hate with banks. We side with reason.1. What kind of transaction is it? In person at merchant pay wave? Submitting credit information online?2. Was there any authorisation by you involved? Authorising OTP? In app notification?3. Any agreement between u and merchant on the correct amount to be paid in the first place?,btohqsg
why is the bank responsible for you making wrong transactions?you should have confirmed the details of the transaction before authorising it.,btohqsg
if you confirmed the details and the bank misprocessed it  then sure  the bank should be support you in this,btohqsg
To claim back the amount  you need:1a). SMS that send to you showing the amount you pay after you authorised the transaction n it is different from the amount deducted from your account.Or1b). Receipt that given to you showing the amount you paid is different from the amount deducted from your account.If you don’t have the two evidences above  go back n talk to the merchant and agree what should be correct amount. Only the merchant can reverse out the amount. The whole transaction is between you and the merchant.Do you have any receipt or photo showing what product/service you bought n how much it should cost. If you don’t have  very hard to prove because a merchant can serve hundreds to thousands of customers in a day  likely they can’t remember everything.It is customer responsibility to check the pre-bill ( draft) amount before merchant entered the amount on the payment terminal. Check the receipt  n make sure everything is correct before leaving the counter.In your case  the receipt issued by the merchant will be the document showing what is the truth.,btohqsg
What is the main consideration behind this xfer?For the moomoo promo? Or ibkr cause its better?,btohqsg
If my memory doesn't fail me  on the bank's auth process it does quote the amount and merchant name,btohqsg
In other words  there most likely was a 2FA before the transaction was approved  and he failed to cross-check before authorising,btohqsg
Yes  even for priority customers  they are useless,btohqsg
Who want to take additional headache when own job already more than enough (probably),btohqsg
That’s how UoB know what people talk in market and strategy to pursue  ocbc have a best cso at a point of time  and they heard that UoB is worse  so they cut cost to make it bad,btohqsg
I know i wouldn’t side with mine 😂. Why a lowly employee needs to protect big corporate anyway. They are rich enough. And i am too small fry. You can complain to me and i have no power to change anything. 😬,btohqsg

Imagine if the spies just help to use the conversations here to correct most of the CSO's errors.,btohqsg

OK I will apply the uob one Cc then thanks,btohqsg
you can also search through past chats for your query  been answered before,btohqsg
Simplygo can use SC Smart card,btohqsg
Don't forget UOB One debit card has annual fee.,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether mcc 5999 accepted by amaze x citi rewards for the 4mpd? Overseas online transaction. Thanks!,btohqsg
Debit card got annual fee? Then can cancel or not,btohqsg
Just to confirm for the uob lady solitaire bonus miles under the selected category i.e. dining  contactless payment via gpay does count right,btohqsg
Yes Uob lady only cares about mcc. As long as it's eligible  payment method doesn't matter.,btohqsg
yes so long mcc is eligible  the payment mode dun matter,btohqsg
Hi all  with the recent nerf to hsbc rev  i was wondering if i purchase something online and the payment mmethod is via apple pay  is it consider online transaction?,btohqsg
That's still considered online. HSBC Revo list of eligible mcc is much worse now. I feel it's best to use other cards instead.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask if anyone ever encounter signing up for similar credit card promo (eg UOB KrisFlyer giving up to 31k miles for new signups + $2k spend)  end up they tell you you're not within the first 100? Do you then get nothing at all  or would they give you something else? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Thanks. Im currently still trying to optimise  but becos its the only 4mpd card that i can use at the moment  had no other choice haha. appreciate it 🙏,btohqsg

After 3 years sure forget. Don't use just cancel.,btohqsg
Hi  just bought specs from lenskart today… checked on heymax to optimized and saw EVOL(before nerf) is one of the better cards to use… but i noted here it says that transactions need to be online to be eligible? I thought mobile contactless should be fine? Have been using EVOL for a while now so not sure if missing anything…,btohqsg
Hi all… if I open a Moomoo account  will I be able to qualify for the transfer in rewards as well as take part in the moomoo cash plus program?,btohqsg
Benefits just does not justify the hefty fee,btohqsg
But happy to keep the physical metal card. Haha,btohqsg
Can use the card as mic holder. Like how Chris is using his amaze card.,btohqsg
Yes... it depends on each individual spending like what bro chris say. Can afford go for it... cannot never mind... for me is because I will go for the marriot programme. I will just pay the annual fee 1740 .. that's it... won't spend on welcome bonus 8k,btohqsg
What you mean bro. Mental card... .. you just say you cancel amex platinum charge card.?,btohqsg
You cancel the card they won’t take back the card lol,btohqsg
Your purpose is mainly for the Marriot programme to get hotel stay benefits?,btohqsg
Yes...Die die I won't cancel Amex. Because I need to use amex pay for hawker and coffee shop...ever since hsbc revolution nerd 5814 . And xnap apps down.. so better to keep Amex,btohqsg
What so great abt the Marriott programme with Amex. U plan to stay at Marriott chain hotels alot?,btohqsg

Name & picture shifter instead of shapeshifter 😂,btohqsg
Why don't get Amex with Hilton program. U might have a chance to run into Paris Hilton. 😆,btohqsg
Sometimes I feel like he's just testing us and he's some kind of lawyer or something,btohqsg
Because usually they have bonus offer for marriot bonvy .. and at discount. Most important is status match between Marriot Bonvoy with kris flyer,btohqsg
Yes.. will switch between marriot bonvy hotels and hilton honors,btohqsg
Well  you have to admit that he boosts discussions and keeps the entire group alive 😂,btohqsg
I am already at Marriott Gold liao. Wait for you to catch up ok? 加油！😜,btohqsg
