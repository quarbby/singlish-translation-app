I agree and don't dispute that the lower and middle income benefitted BUT this is only after the given subsidise ( likely or mostly for a few years only) after that  they will face the full impact of it. Of course when it is a GE years more goodies will be hanging on the horizon.,btohqsg

Ya that's why I also don't think it's sustainable to keep increasing GST. I can't believe in my short lifetime I experience 3 GST hikes already...The issue w GST vouchers is also that its given one lump sum. Idk how come the whole MOF never consider that households cannot realistically swee swee allocate GST relief across 12 mths or 24 mths or whatever.I don't want to be bus3rd but usually those who need GST vouchers the most are not the best at financial planning thru no fault of their own. What do they do when they have been scrimping for 11 mths and suddenly get zheng hu lui? Of course the rational thing to do is they splurge a bit.So maybe during GST voucher disbursement period can look at grocery plays like Sheng Siong 😂😂😂,btohqsg

I'm dead on the inside already,btohqsg
Plus there are so many indirect cost increases. Got a sort of 'bull whip effect' across the supply chain. Where got people end off their price with 3c or 7c or what. Ppl just round up to 5 or 0. This is an 'indirect' way of fleecing the consumer.,btohqsg
