and I admire your humility too. You don't try and act like a subject matter authority even though you really do know a lot about Volvos  plus don't make sweeping statements,btohqsg
and not just Volvos actually  but cars in general from current to previous gens.,btohqsg

The Chinese vs the Koreans n the contis,btohqsg

Ford unveils 2 000bhp Pro Electric SuperVanAll it takes is less than 2-seconds to reach 100km/h from a standstill😱😱😱👉🏻 React with 😱 if you are shocked with the Ford Pro Electric SuperVan’s specs!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Wahhhhhhhhh all EVs are soooooo Powerful. It needed 20inch rim  so that they can fit big 6pot brake kit😂,btohqsg
Can't really tell real photos or renders anymore lol,btohqsg
I think the Chinese actually are ahead in terms of production numbers and tech actually. Look at who has cleverly cornered batt tech and production in the EV segment 😆😆,btohqsg
They had no choice.They have to go EVs bcos of air pollution.certain states  During Peak Hours  non Evs not allowed to enter CBD,btohqsg
For sure sir. They definitely don’t make us feel shortchanged by working hard to roll out new models even faster than the usual 7-year product cycles. I notice some EV companies are not announcing new models to keep development and production costs down in an already very challenging economic environment,btohqsg
Interesting observation to that is they are no longer simply final assembly lines with key tech and modules being imported  but with deep local content in core technology and manufacturing. The investment and R&D expenditure into this sector over the years far exceeds many countries at a time when many countries have cut back on R&D dollars.,btohqsg

What stupid price is that  can buy tesla m3 performance liao,btohqsg
"I think I know why he selling the Ioniq5. Everyday kena ""suan "" stupid can buy Tesla with this price 😂",btohqsg
Yes...but the korean start the ball rolling  before the chinese gets even more inovative,btohqsg
Exactly hahahaha spend angus steak money go buy kimchi,btohqsg
Not that it’s bad too right? Might be wrong but I thought a lot of cars use DOT3 as a standard and it should work well?,btohqsg
Suddenly what Late Mr Lee Kuan Yew said about China is very real now.,btohqsg
Signs are there. Many chose to (and are still choosing to) ignore,btohqsg
