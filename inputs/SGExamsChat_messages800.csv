Curious but how do JCs calculate predicted grades,btohqsg
Basically the application period for UK uni is like october (cant rmb) but it closes before release of the  sg A Level results. Most students (both uk and sg) apply to the Uk uni using predicted A Level grades which is what the school predicts they will get before the actual A level exam. I think some US unis give offers based on predicted grades BUT im not too sureSo my question is how do schs esp SG JCs determine predicted grades. Do they look at all of y6  or just prelim? Do they inflate grades ? (As many ppl tend to underperform at Prelims),btohqsg
Is that what they talk about in the pre u sem,btohqsg
How grades are predicted can vary from one school to another. Some schools use the idea of expected improvement between prelim vs As based on past year statsFor example  if a school notices a fairly consistent two-grade shift between prelim vs As for a particular subject  they can project a B (or even A/B) grade for someone who scores D in prelims for that subject,btohqsg
No im not even a participant,btohqsg
Oh I see. Thanks for the insight,btohqsg
Pls don't let the patient get rejected from Art School if he ever applies gotta auto accept him,btohqsg
