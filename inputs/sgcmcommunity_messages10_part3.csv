Totally. Using ICE criteria to categorise EVs,btohqsg
Battery got difference   nca and lfp,btohqsg
Nca is much more expensive due to a lot of nickal that cost alot,btohqsg
These can be updated criteria yes.,btohqsg
Challenge of ev is u can’t be cheap with good battery,btohqsg
Not like ice small cc can move ok already,btohqsg
But tech will improve so maybe is possible. Haha. We won’t know,btohqsg
And battery technology China is like 2nd to none,btohqsg
What we know is that currently EV ownership is not that attractive for new car buyers.,btohqsg
So u will see China brand dominating,btohqsg
Byd blade battery technology is no joke,btohqsg
And they had overtake Mercedes’ and bmw in market cap alredyy,btohqsg
Of coz I think paying a fair price for good tech is ok. But most of the decent EVs really too far from the ICE equivalent alr,btohqsg
Until it is in parity  otherwise not attractive,btohqsg
Yes but the whole world not giving us an option hehe,btohqsg
Byd so far is the only brand with low cost and good range,btohqsg
As they are leader in ev battery,btohqsg
Any opinion if I should get vezel or Yaris hybrid. Both around 110-120k,btohqsg
I sat in Yaris and vezel before,btohqsg
Vezel feel like the car is gonna flip over   noisy and light when doing corner,btohqsg
Yaris is a saloon car. Vezel is taller suv,btohqsg
Ya but vezel feel so unstable haha,btohqsg
Get Mazda la. Value for money,btohqsg
I test drove it. I didn’t like it. Felt very tin can.,btohqsg
I everytime take grab see is vezel i ask then drive slower,btohqsg
It isn’t selling too well honestly.,btohqsg
Beautiful. Drives well. Complete car you’ll feel,btohqsg
That’s hardly a criteria. Do you buy a Car based on their sales number? Don’t. Decide for yourself that it’s a good car therefore you buy. Don’t follow masses,btohqsg
Yaris cross. Sorry I wasn’t clear,btohqsg
Looking for suv or compact suv,btohqsg
Get Mazda. Cx30. You won’t regret.,btohqsg
I think is quite small right.,btohqsg
Go check it out in showroom. Stylish abs nice. Expensive interior.,btohqsg
I enjoy my Mazda more than my bmw,btohqsg
Got other options like Citroen C4. But I heard quite unreliable,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will shop around. Waiting for the COE to drop more (hopefully),btohqsg
Next month mass mg in cat a,btohqsg
Go with an open mind. You’ll be good. Do not pre judge,btohqsg
Actuallt no  I did test drive it. I didn’t like it. :(,btohqsg
If u want big  go cx5,btohqsg
Very tin can and it was selling at 93 999,btohqsg
But yaDerrick Chanjust test drive for yourself first.,btohqsg
Mazda crash testing even higher than volvo,btohqsg
My Mazda feels solid. Euro feel. Suspension doors body all form,btohqsg
In the past yeah. Today most brands equal if not better,btohqsg
But volvo is terrible at fuel economy. I rented a v70 wagon. It’s horrible fuel consumption.,btohqsg
Shd make a top earning salesman,btohqsg
Salesperson of Porsche told me the porche gt4 rs can be had for 630k to take delivery in 2 years time,btohqsg
Much expensive if it is cat b. Haha,btohqsg
If u want space  go for cx5. If u want newer technology  go for cx30,btohqsg
