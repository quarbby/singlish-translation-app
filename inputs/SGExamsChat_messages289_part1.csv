as for my qn 3a i got the final change in length with negative value which is compression. Not sure if this was correct while I saw my other friends they got the final ans for change in length positive which is elongation instead. Not sure if it matter if the change of length ans was negative or positive or if is compression or elongation.,btohqsg

Mood  I used to work 6h shift but bluff people one. Expected to OT anyway.,btohqsg
My internship was 12h shifts but only work 3 days a week.Super rabak tho coz when phase 1 opened we had to OT even after 12h WITHOUT DINNER,btohqsg
Was glad when 3 days was up smh,btohqsg
There's always secret tools uses by HR,btohqsg
I applied full time there but lucky they weren't hiring full timers,btohqsg
U planning to stay after internship is over?,btohqsg
Did they pay you for 6h or 12h?,btohqsg
I also expected to do OT as my station is one of the busiest stations in my department  but I think I don't have to do OT soon as I'm now doing things quite fastMy mentor will finally come back tomorrowShe will have to choose either me or my teammate as her mentee permanently and either one of us will be transferred to somewhere else  which might be a little bit boring yet also one of the busiest stations. I hope my mentor will choose me as I really like doing this kind of lab work,btohqsg
well not really  though i always failed math but this time i passed by a bare minimum. i really don't know what to do for math,btohqsg
thank you so much! means a lot ☺️,btohqsg
but so far i got a lot of Bs,btohqsg
maybe after going thru ur paper u can reflect like what went wrong? if its conceptual error  go through with your teacher/research online/watch videos  and then after you are extremely clear on the topic  attempt some revision questions! once you are confident  move on to practice papers.you can also try explaining the topic to a friend because it also helps your own understanding as well!!,btohqsg
alright thank you! i'm weak in coordinate geometry  and idk how to study on this topic to improve,btohqsg
Spend this last 2 weeks to consult with your teacher,btohqsg
Maybe ask for a zoom session to ask what you need to know,btohqsg
okay! sometimes i also dk what to ask bc i'm so confused myself,btohqsg

Any thoughts on the nlvl phy paper?,btohqsg
That time yea I got ask if they hiring but the senior chemist told me they weren't  think coz of hiring freeze during covid that time  the workplace only can have x amount of people present then maybe tough to hire and arrange around the manpower limit,btohqsg
Ooooo  I get what you mean  but internship is a good time to learn outside of the dept. I think the OT thing really is see your supervisor  like for my side now  my supervisor told the intern actually cannot let him OT  but if need be it's up to the intern whether he wants to stay or not.,btohqsg
I left them when my internship over and never apply back HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I'm working for their competitor kek,btohqsg
