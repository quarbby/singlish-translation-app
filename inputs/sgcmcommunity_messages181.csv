or did you cherry pick PI price for cheapest A200 then compare it to borneos ES300h price which is a totally different and higher tier car?,btohqsg
A Class and ES are 2 diff cat,btohqsg
yes C&C A class vs Borneo ES,btohqsg
To compare  u need to compare C and IS,btohqsg
i think i have gone on about this long enough,btohqsg
ES is at E class n 5 Series cat,btohqsg
A class is just a hatch w a backside,btohqsg
you compared an A180 to an ES300h,btohqsg
you literally did not read a single thing i said,btohqsg
did you read what i said?,btohqsg
could you do me a favour and scroll up?,btohqsg
anyway  i have nothing further to add,btohqsg
dealer pricelist thats all they have. U comparing the screenshot from SGCM? that one isnt accurate,btohqsg
if you want to create your own cars to compare. be my guest  but thats not the comparison i made  so do me a favour and keep me out of it,btohqsg
have fun  compare tiers all you like. just dont put words in my mouth and get me involved unnecessarily,btohqsg
you don't know what you are comparing,btohqsg
ES250 is not an ES300h  and A180 is not an A200 from C & C,btohqsg
i cant make it any clearer than that. you dont get it  and im not going to try and convince you,btohqsg
why do you even bother with arguments trying to compare apple vs orange is beyond me,btohqsg
and all this started with me  simply thinking the ES300h has a nice interior  since i've sat in one.,btohqsg
the tiers these people are mostly imagined. i went purely on price. some guys here are so damn triggered and honestly i am perplexed why this is the case,btohqsg
i can reverse it and say  people who need a large sedan cant afford an E class  so they get an ES,btohqsg
thats your opinion and you are entitled to it. see how i am not in the least bit bothered by it?,btohqsg
try doing that next time  life will be much nicer,btohqsg
i don't think anyone is bothered by your comparison either. we are just trying to educate you that you are not comparing apples with apples,btohqsg
i happen to think a 6 cyl e class is actually a very nice car,btohqsg
But seriously two different tier car. Can't compare,btohqsg
the only education i have recieved is that a lot of people here are very emotionally attached and some others have trouble with reading comprehension,btohqsg
Price list is not accurate. A lot of overtrade and so called discount component. A200 definitely not $300k car,btohqsg
i think thats what most people have been trying to tell him,btohqsg
comparison requires an objective standard. otherwise we can anyhow cook whatever price we want based on the discount we can expect. borneo does give discounts too. official numbers are the best way to compare. that is my opinion and i am not triggered if some people feel differently,btohqsg
Ya lo. Need to visit the AD  only will know,btohqsg
not once did you even insinuate anything close to that btw,btohqsg
The you don't reply already la,btohqsg
its people keep replying to me leh,btohqsg
saying all sorts of stuff i did not say and not reading what i said earlier lol,btohqsg
Apologies if it‚Äôs the wrong place to post. But any help would be appreciated. Anybody knows what‚Äôs this bug? It‚Äôs inside the vent of my laptop and my laptop is in my car. Not sure if there infestation in my car,btohqsg
Do fumigation for your car ba,btohqsg
If you don't wanna do yourself can find someone to do for you on carousell  otherwise buy a can and DIY quite cheap on shopee,btohqsg
Even if you don't eat in the car also still can kena... Normal lol,btohqsg
Looks like a cockroach. It's suggested to do fumigation of your car. It'll fully kill any insects hiding in your car. Traps are not as effective.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôll have to pick up their dead bodies ü§Æ,btohqsg
Like I said find a fumigation service they'll do that for you.. just pay a bit more,btohqsg
There are some car wash shops in JB that provides this service. At same time  they'll fully clean and maintain the insides.,btohqsg
Just do a google search for those in JB. SG also have but will be more expensive.,btohqsg
Cockroach  sometimes if you park near drain they will enter your car through the air vent,btohqsg
Especially when the area you are parking in doing the fumigation  sometimes the roaches run to the car to hide,btohqsg
Better do the car fumigation  if you unlucky and have a mother roach entering the vehicle. Have big chance that it has laid eggs in your car,btohqsg
I agree. I never had any cockroach in my car until I sent it in for sound proofing installation. First day of driving  I saw one running across the dashboard. So I can guess where it came from. Just send in to fumigate clean  no more roaches.,btohqsg
Omg will do so asap. Thanks all üôèüèº,btohqsg
Somemore I got baby in car,btohqsg
All the more to keep the car clean. I've a personal policy for the car...no eating in the car. Lower the chances of uninvited 'guests' inside.,btohqsg
@DogeMasterzthinks that someone who needs an ES will buy an A class because of the badge.,btohqsg
wah you guys still triggered from yesterday?,btohqsg
i said its in the same price bracket and i proved it. Still salty? dude go chill somewhere,btohqsg
whats wrong with some of you guys. cannot read. cannot control tempers. sigh,btohqsg
i on MC today can entertain these idiots all day,btohqsg
idk why but i feel like its pete w 3 accounts,btohqsg
you are litereally saying the same dumb shit you said yesterday LMAO,btohqsg
which i addressed multiple times. you are really bottom tier sia,btohqsg
notice noone else is asking me the same thing except you? ever wonder why?,btohqsg
just stop feeding the troll bro,btohqsg
go do something more useful with your time,btohqsg
I will buy ES over A200,btohqsg
help me ask these idiots to stop tagging me and spamming my TG,btohqsg
scroll up and find the answer or stay stupid. byeeee,btohqsg
its damn funny  really low iq,btohqsg
lucky i got better things to do,btohqsg
already schooled the troll yesterday  so wont be doing it twice,btohqsg
Same  only if my budget allows. But for now  dream on for me,btohqsg
its too bad because the non hybrid es250 was much more affordable. but borneo seems to only sell the hybrid now,btohqsg
singapore property price very ex. so its awesome to live rent free in your head. lol loser,btohqsg
spam somemore leh. your time is cheaper than mine,btohqsg
he got schooled. now in toilet crying,btohqsg
hi gurus  can i ask if i can apply for multiple car loans and select the one i want at a later time?,btohqsg
See which one give u best rates,btohqsg
Now what is the best rates? The last time I checked used car was 2.98,btohqsg
So what about u? Own a car?,btohqsg
Click on the button to see the chat rules!,btohqsg
hi everyone  i‚Äôm a jc student writing a research paper on petrol tax and how it has affected consumer behaviour. i hope you don‚Äôt mind me sending this out here  but if u own a car (especially a petrol car) i would rly appreciate if you could take two mins to complete this survey! i need about 100 responses & all submissions are anonymous :) (sorry no rewards for completion üòÖ)https://forms.gle/b3Gyom9jVyoUEiZKA,btohqsg
Nvr ask for ur email n contacts,btohqsg
thank u! sorry no ill intents here  i‚Äôm just a desperate student hahaha,btohqsg
The chances of ppl reducing their car usage is NIL thoü§£,btohqsg
Thts what i put I think,btohqsg
We alr spend so much to pay for the damn car  why leave it to rot inside the carpark?,btohqsg
They shld reintroduce park n ride,btohqsg
Thn those stay within 1km radius of MRT or Bus interchange  their season parking double of current,btohqsg
WAIT I KNOW HOW PPL CAN REDUCE USAGE,btohqsg
why wud i drive n park then take train again?,btohqsg
With MYR  we all die ah,btohqsg
Thats how ppl reduce driving ü§£,btohqsg
As in if u r staying near mrt or interchange  ur season get more ex,btohqsg
But seriously now 2023 JC ask 2021,btohqsg
Ask How COE affect cost of living lah,btohqsg
Cos 2021 was the last petrol tax hike ma,btohqsg
So I alr pay more to stay near MRT,btohqsg
Now i penalised to own a car?,btohqsg
Wa bro thats how the GRC suddenly collapse sia,btohqsg
The 2021 tax hike was bad move. Legit.,btohqsg
Lets see what Uncle Lawrence has up in his sleeves before he become PM in 2024,btohqsg
No choice. No erp to make money,btohqsg
Hdb give a lot of grace period,btohqsg
Walau serious the few cents also wanna earn,btohqsg
I got a feeling he gonna announce rabak car owning measures,btohqsg
Woah pls do it after i renew coe okay HAHAH,btohqsg
Have faith in Uncle Wong la,btohqsg
Maybe he reduce EV road tax?,btohqsg
Then if u petrol sell n buy Ev  u get additional rebates,btohqsg
i think his best bet is to reduce volatility of COE,btohqsg
And to confirm with ERP 2.0  We are moving from Ownership tax to Usage tax,btohqsg
Otherwise  all bets r off during GE bro,btohqsg
They wont announce until 90% of the cars r fitted w it,btohqsg
But the 2.0 i suspect is zonal,btohqsg
Base on how long u stay in e zone,btohqsg
Doesnt matter. Ur policy statement is more important than wtv change u did,btohqsg
I only pray for lower road tax for EV,btohqsg
Then penalty + suspension for those who never report,btohqsg
No report can claim w video evidence,btohqsg
Cancelling their insurance isnt a punishment. Real punishment is when they not able to drive or next prem increase,btohqsg
Petrol vehicle will still be avail in the markets no matter how they promote the ev,btohqsg
But idm moving to Hybrids and EV,btohqsg
Less petrol vehicles  lesser leases on the petrol stations in Singapore . Then where to get the extra funds for the government?,btohqsg
Who pay for the charging ports ?,btohqsg
Now the petrol station going to charge more on those vehicles using the charging ports after they charged fully,btohqsg
I mean ppl has been using it to park,btohqsg
Speaks volume about our civic mindedness,btohqsg
Many inconsiderate users out there who also happen to own ev,btohqsg
Can chiong for one last ICE,btohqsg
Maybe by then cannot renew for ICE,btohqsg
Hi guru can I ask what is the feedback for peugeot 3008 car ?,btohqsg
Is this car very problematic ?,btohqsg
Any car that isnt well-maintained is problematic,btohqsg
I wld send the car for a health check before buying,btohqsg
Why owner sell 3008 ? Reliability issues ? Electronics?,btohqsg
it's a 7 year old renault... sure will have problems,btohqsg
only a lottery whether serious or not,btohqsg
Sell get cash and buy new car,btohqsg
U have deep pocket then buy  if not never ever touch  I had spent 3-4k annually for repair  I tried to sell also not ppl want  till the last 14 months  ECU down  mechanic told me about 4k to replace  finally I scrapped it.,btohqsg
In my opinion  go for Japanese car  never touch Peugeot  Renault  Opel  sure burn your fingers.,btohqsg
Lf driver / technician job pm me 2.4-2.6k a month,btohqsg
Had this same model previously  high fuel consumption and engine stalling problem that no one  not the specialist workshop  not even the AD can solve. Almost kena rear end when the engine cut out when trying to change lane at Bartley junction. Changed more than $2k worth of parts.Finally managed to offload the car to a willing dealer. Never French again. The fanboys will tell you the cars are better now but I will tell people  don‚Äôt even try it once.,btohqsg
Your own choice. Bus n mrt are available.  You choose to suffer,btohqsg
But we'll  maintained conti cars  super problematic,btohqsg
We got so many oil and gas refinery in Jurong island and pulau bukom  Gov still dare to ban ICE car meh?,btohqsg
Confirm when the time come  they spin it as new technology renewable or environmentally friendly oil or smth,btohqsg
Oil n gas not for cars only lei,btohqsg
Ur petrol is just a small fraction of petroleum,btohqsg
"Well I recommended 4 of my friends Skoda and all zero issues lehWhile my own Citroen and all my other friends' Citroen were money pitsAll french cars same. Even the French themselves have a saying  ""every month a new noise"".And unlike VW group products  no one wants to repair French cars in SG",btohqsg
We make the black sticky liquid into clear liquid for many uses,btohqsg
Does french car have bad history like Korean cars? I also notice many of the older folks strongly advice people not to get french cars,btohqsg
In heaven:Your cook is Italian.Your mechanic is German.Your policeman is English.Your lover is French.It is all organized by the Swiss.In hell:Your cook is English.Your mechanic is French.Your policeman is German.Your lover is Swiss.It is all organized by the Italians.,btohqsg
Korean cars have bad reputation.French cars have bad history. There's a difference hahaha,btohqsg
korean cars in recent years have been better,btohqsg
I never had problems w my Kia K3 running 250k in 12mths,btohqsg
My current Stonic  115k. No problems,btohqsg
idk what the hell they did,btohqsg
but the car is good n reliable,btohqsg
my hyundai was the only car that i nvr repair anything before,btohqsg
just send it in for servicing,btohqsg
The Forte before the K3 also good build,btohqsg
Its the reputation only. The cars are not problematic and parts are cheapI regret not getting Kia Carens instead of my C4 Picasso that time  saw my friend using it and he ran it to 220 000km with zero issues while my car at 50 000 already everything start to pecahAnd the parts on Carens are measured in double digit  everything on French car must set aside your 13th month,btohqsg
The cheap Kai Picanto also a workhorse,btohqsg
If u see how the Police abuse the Avante u will know its a soild car,btohqsg
U want good solid car  just buy what the police and PHV drivers r using can already,btohqsg
Phv are like mostly vezel and mazda 3,btohqsg
Taxi where got vezel n m3,btohqsg
Taxi I see alot is the Hyundai dunno which brand,btohqsg
Got Kia taxi? I got see MG one but not the kia,btohqsg
So for new driver just see what car PHV and taxi use  should be ok,btohqsg
The amount of accessories for the taxi payment like excessive lei,btohqsg
Haven't include the new ERP one also,btohqsg
U haven been to Korea n China before hor,btohqsg
Never took their taxi  last time follow tour bus for china,btohqsg
U sit their taxi and u will know our taxi r nothing compared to theirs,btohqsg
I went China without changing a single cent,btohqsg
Taxi paid by app  or scan,btohqsg
Korea can scan tmoney like u scan ur bus n mrt,btohqsg
We also have similar thing with paynow or the comfort delgro app or smth,btohqsg
Still need wait for taxi driver stop meter  press here n there then ask u for ur card,btohqsg
Korea once taxi press stop  u just scan ur tmoney n alight,btohqsg
Singapore looks good with all the tech. But when it comes to implementation  its as good as nothing,btohqsg
This one I think can implemented by the taxi companies  but dunno SG taxi company want to do it or not,btohqsg
Its whether NETS n Govtech want to do it or not,btohqsg
Sg is far from being a cashless society,btohqsg
NETS die die must take service charge,btohqsg
Our Ezlink was the best bet,btohqsg
debit and cr card also 3 - 5%,btohqsg
But no one want to make it big,btohqsg
i think for businesses paynow also got 50cent charge,btohqsg
imagine the hawker sell one item $1,btohqsg
Thts y some hawker use their own number,btohqsg
i rmb it was fixed a few years back,btohqsg
My house coffeeshop uncle use his own number,btohqsg
Went korea shopping. Some major brands dont take cash,btohqsg
At one shop  we pay the shopkeeper cash then she use her own credit card swipe for us,btohqsg
Why its so difficult to have a unified cashless payment.,btohqsg
Ezlink n NETS r such failure,btohqsg
NETs is a decades old system that has seen little to no update,btohqsg
that's why banks like ocbc and dbs have to develop their own wallet app like paylah and payanyone which are both failures on their own also,btohqsg
after my money gone missing in between my paylah successful transaction and my friend not receiving money in UOB account  and shitty service from DBS when i complained to them I cancelled all my accounts with dbs,btohqsg
Thts why unified payment system in Sg is a failure,btohqsg
Sometimes paying cash in sg faster thn scanning QR,btohqsg
It is always whether the employees wanted to go for extra miles to help or not .,btohqsg
i30 hyundai made in Czech. Good quality.,btohqsg
Yes more hp than a golf for a 1.4 ü§£,btohqsg
Good HP per dollar. Value for money hatch. üòâ,btohqsg

You people like to complain this failure n that failure? Look at malaysia.,btohqsg
My definition of success is going caipng stall can order fish,btohqsg
My definition of success is spending $12 on a plate of nasi padang,btohqsg
My definition of success is vpower full tank,btohqsg
Damn high sia n they wondering why ppl dw QR code,btohqsg
Its a double whammy. Use qr code u lost % of sales,btohqsg
U dun use QR u lose revenue if cx no cash,btohqsg
Use QR code on personal acct lor,btohqsg
Thts what many r doing now,btohqsg
U QR to business acct u incur charges,btohqsg
Last time pre 2017 yes  now different lah. At least they got try to change. French still block head,btohqsg
i think skoda looks promising now,btohqsg
Well  I not here to sell any brand but I can say this  during the 5 years I drove French vs. my friends Skoda  their cars all only wear and tear + clutch change. No MU or other major issues. And btw  Skoda SG replace my friend‚Äôs clutch FOC.Meanwhile for me:Picasso - 2nd layer oil leak (famous issue with this DV6 engine)  centre display fail  BPGA battery management box fail  gearbox actuator  somemore AD order parts just before warranty than after warranty end refuse to replace FOC  need to payScenic - engine no issues but I replace evaporator coil twice within 6 mths thankfully under warranty  each coil is $2+k. Just before warranty end I immediately sup chut kir5008 - as previously mentioned  unsolvable high FC  engine stalling,btohqsg
i just walk out of AD,btohqsg
Ya. I didn‚Äôt pay. Sold the car off üòùSo in a sense I damn heng cos each car chut its pattern while still under warranty‚Ä¶ feel bad for those who buy such cars with few years remaining and then kena hit with all the failures left right centre,btohqsg
No wonder dealers need to tah..,btohqsg
Yah‚Ä¶ and resale value so low.,btohqsg
Paynow company same as paynow own number. Just that use NETS or paywave like that then they charge commission,btohqsg
The commission isn't that big..? Unless your txn are small lah...,btohqsg
So if u paynow via UEN 0 charges ah,btohqsg
Okay guess Im wrong abt the charge,btohqsg
When it is time to pay   you need to pay .,btohqsg
My colleague tempted with the Peugeot 408GT after watching sgcarmart review. He is hoping Cat A car drop today so got motivation to test drive,btohqsg
See today cat A can drop or not,btohqsg
Ask him siam french cars legit,btohqsg
His current car is Citroen  he drive 5 years already still ok. He told me maybe his luck good with french car,btohqsg
His luck will run out w P,btohqsg
He my senior lol  my balls not that big to tell him,btohqsg
His luck all used up with his current car,btohqsg
Ask him join this chat we tell him for you,btohqsg
The guy like in his 50s  dunno what is telegram,btohqsg
Then let him suffer in silence lo,btohqsg
Haiz  maybe his son will convince him,btohqsg
A might drop a bit more,btohqsg
Last bidding for Dec will explode,btohqsg
Last few days to enjoy the 8% Gst,btohqsg
ComfortDelGro taxi flagdown fares to go up by S$0.50  and the cheapest cab ride will start at S$4.40 from Dec 13. Peak hour surcharges will also be revised:https://cna.asia/3R8tono,btohqsg
"""COE"" doesnt affect me cus i dun drive",btohqsg
Dont affect me too cos I don‚Äôt drive,btohqsg
Cat A n B gg to explode liao,btohqsg
Cat C alrdy explode to 50k,btohqsg
Cat A start alrdy. 54129 @ 3.45pm,btohqsg
hopefully next year bidding not so hiong,btohqsg
Next year even if Coe drop  the rest of the cost will go up,btohqsg
So end up still pay the same..,btohqsg
Tbh. I think in 10yrs  the need for a car really redundant,btohqsg
B n Open drop. A went up,btohqsg
Instead of go down it go up üíÄ,btohqsg
85 to 88k i think okay,btohqsg
Ya  still worth to get this year CAT A hybrid cause of the 15k VES and 1% less get.,btohqsg
Tell him no. 1.2 turbo on a 3 cylinder can die,btohqsg
He don't want see already hahaha,btohqsg
Some will choose to get new car this year cos you'll pay more with the 1% GST increase in 2024.,btohqsg
He will step damn hard for the car to move,btohqsg
dk which one say COE no GST,btohqsg
but the car itself got GST,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  they just think it for the overall cost. Then again  if you have $ to pay for car  this 1% increase might not mean a lot to that person.,btohqsg
Why the cat A pqp still 99k,btohqsg
Drop or increase still more cars otr lei,btohqsg
The amt of cars will b the same,btohqsg
Unless freak results. One day demand lower thn quota,btohqsg
They're bringing forward deregistrations from 15 year mark to bring down prices. So cars otr go up for next 5 years,btohqsg
The end game for diesel n ice cars,btohqsg
Are they still allowing diesel cars to renew coe?,btohqsg
Or the renewal will fall in line with the 0 sales of diesel cars,btohqsg
Buy an ICE in 2029. Drive till 2039 then renew till 2049,btohqsg
Dunno at 2030 still alive or not,btohqsg
Hi guys  am looking to change from a vios to a used 535i next year. Understand that everything will be more expensive but was just wondering how reliable is the N52/N53 engine,btohqsg
i think its coe? can give u the link,btohqsg
1st reg date  how many owners  mileage,btohqsg
Good condition worry free 2nd hand BM is 1 in 50,btohqsg
Set aside 5k for parts like gasket leaks   check lights sensors and lower arms change all these can't last in modern bmw.,btohqsg
Do u think u will be the lucky 1?,btohqsg
He lucky if owner change before selling,btohqsg
Looking at how its being 'styled' its an abused car,btohqsg
and im a bmw fan since young,btohqsg
Most of us will avoid 2nd hand conti. Let alone a COE one,btohqsg
may ik what are some things to look out for when i visit the dealer?,btohqsg
Unless u dont mind spending w money for repairs or change parts when u get it,btohqsg
Bmw = leaks in engine bay,btohqsg
If u pocket deep n die die want to buy  send the car for a detailed health check first,btohqsg
Dealer now smarter they will dry up the engine bay first before u come.,btohqsg
PPI is ur best bet to check faults,btohqsg
so can i just ask the dealer if i could send the car to my workshop to take a look at the car and advice?,btohqsg
sorry newbie first time car buyer here,btohqsg
Your main worry is the turbo going into limp mode for this model 535i,btohqsg
usually if car no problem they okay,btohqsg
if let's say they refuse saying car no problem dont need check,btohqsg
They will ask u pay deposit n sign first,btohqsg
i just walk away from the deal liao,btohqsg
But t&c u must black until cannot black,btohqsg
Ppi fail  deal off n deposit refund,btohqsg
Dont be like a member here,btohqsg
The turbo only can last 80-120k must change one after that,btohqsg
Sign everything then PPI fail but nvr black n white,btohqsg
isit true after 100km u need to change certain parts related to the engine?,btohqsg
T&C dealer will always diam diam,btohqsg
also one more qns.. if trade in my current vios  will dealer lowball me compared to market price?,btohqsg
how much was that to replace?,btohqsg
Vios to that BM is a very big jump. Why don't want get entry level / cheaper bm?,btohqsg
but not a fan of the interior,btohqsg
at first wanted a kia stinger,btohqsg
so i looked for related models and found that most 535i left 6+ years,btohqsg
I also wanted a stinger at first... But discontinued the parts gonna be a problem,btohqsg
so what car did you get?,btohqsg
erm i saw some reviews on edmw,btohqsg
not really sure if the 640i is reliable from the feedback from there,btohqsg

They dont sell. The better ones are kept or transfered privately.,btohqsg
Hello  what additives would you highly recommend to add to your fuel system.,btohqsg
Can use those boosters & cleaners at the same time?,btohqsg
Haha it can be yours for the right price,btohqsg
Don't really need those. Once in a while  you can just pump the higher end fuel from Shell/Caltex to use it to clean your engine. The price you pay for the additives  can add up to pay for those premium fuel once in a while.,btohqsg
Go JB put shell Racing ah ü§£,btohqsg
But you'll need 3/4 tank full to travel over to JB tho. So might not be a good option for some.,btohqsg
Take risk   1/4 tank go inside . Not always they will check .,btohqsg
Bmw 6 cyls more reliable than their 4 cyls,btohqsg

Hello all  quick question.. for new cars.. do you suggest going for ceramic coating straight away or wait awhile?,btohqsg
Just do if u have the money,btohqsg
U want to do ppf also can,btohqsg
Do it straight away since still fresh. Paintwork uncontaminated and seal in the gloss. Any reason y u wanna wait out?,btohqsg
new cars paint job usually already fully cured and harden.. so can immediately coat. only those after respray then need to wait,btohqsg
waiting is only required for ppf if your paint is very fresh. Ceramic coating is a totally different thing and can be done anytime,btohqsg
