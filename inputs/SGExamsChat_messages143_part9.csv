ppl look at grades like its gonna define ur life,btohqsg
did anyone ask ur teacher wads ur predicted grades frm moe,btohqsg
My skool and Jurong Sec both did it,btohqsg
yeah but some of them refuse to bite the bullet and they have fun throughout the year den gg,btohqsg
Hmmm.. i am surprised that my jc has too,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re allowed to reveal even after you graduate,btohqsg
In the A level GP exam since they sent the papers to the Uk I wrote a paragraph on UK stuff. Don't know why many people only write Singapore stuff ,btohqsg
No  Jurong was my internship school,btohqsg
Nope. I was accepted quickly but I was frankly fed up with Singapore. I was so depressing. Better go elsewhere.,btohqsg
Hahaha yes ur self expectation is really high. But good job bro. Rmb to take a chill pill sometimes ya,btohqsg
like lets say ur on good terms w the cher,btohqsg
Ouch. It hurts. Actually my jc sch counsellor also told me dun waste time when i wanted to quit sch. I fking dun respect her views thereafter cos she insensitive to my situation and study needs,btohqsg
The issue with prelims in Singapore is that the grades usually aren't good. Applying for overseas universities are tough. For example no one in my JC2 school had A for GP. Max was B.,btohqsg
THEY MADE YOU SIT THRU RESULTS DAY,btohqsg
For o level i ask my teacher on msn but she keep on siam my question so i eventually figured out she not supposed to reveal ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ cos i been doing badly in physics but my combined science grade turned out well so i asked her. Then later i ask her is it she not allowed to say  then she say yes,btohqsg
would get my ass to stop procrastinating,btohqsg
I never attended results day. The school later called my parents to pick it up.,btohqsg
I know some people can be so insensitive. I also had bad experience with some counsellors,btohqsg
Hows results day for your school?,btohqsg
Do they like announce everyone's results?,btohqsg
U probably got like 40+ anyway,btohqsg
they show the students who got 5 and more distinctions xp,btohqsg
Not up to the standards of an ACSian ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Cos everyone was young wad. We always wanna cherish our youth living carefree. Cos thats our best spot,btohqsg
no compassion  empathy  respect. that person is an asshole,btohqsg
Ya thats the stressful part in my mind. I wonder why we bother cos foreigners marking our paper. Aiya whatever la,btohqsg
Thank you. But I think I shall get her out of my life.,btohqsg
What country u feel is better?,btohqsg
I should write a thank you card to Khan Academy instead of my school's teachers,btohqsg
earlier this year  i had suicidal thoughts. since my friends realised that  they referred me to the sch councillor. turns out i felt even more worse. instead  she just told me to deal with it. luckily  i had supportive friends and teacher who help me overcome it. moral of the story  never go to a councillor as they only emphasise on your prob and find out hidden ones.,btohqsg
I just went to the UK to do an exchange and I loved it!,btohqsg
yea if that's what you wish  then it's a good idea. keeping her in your life more can just make you feel worse,btohqsg
Then u stay home ðŸ˜‚ dun have maths   dun go anywhere,btohqsg
omg Khan Academy that dude is a legend,btohqsg
Yeah  I wanted to commit suicide in JC1,btohqsg
I think empathy is very important to people in that situation,btohqsg
IDK I felt like I took IB a bit too lightly,btohqsg
ck12 and khan academy have helped me more than all of my teachers,btohqsg
Like schools always focus on who did well and never talk about those who didnt,btohqsg
then you end up thinking that anyone can do well,btohqsg
and oragnic chemistry tutor for me,btohqsg
end up the statistics are very different,btohqsg
"sigh.. i'm glad you feel better now. it's such an asian thing for people to say ""get over it"" in response to someone talking about their emotions which is like a taboo subject lol",btohqsg
I was startled ðŸ˜‚ i didnt expect that from a counsellor!??? I felt hopeless  cos i tot at least i can get some help from counsellor cos she is counsellor leh hello,btohqsg
This was what I wrote for my A level GP  one paragraph of it,btohqsg
If counsellor cant help i tot nobody could alr,btohqsg
And you know how whenever there are open house  they always ask those top achievers to give propaganda speeches,btohqsg
But a cohort has so many ppl how to announce everyone??,btohqsg
and yes then lead to this,btohqsg
some councillors ( most actually) dont really help you to overcome what you are going thru. change my mind,btohqsg
