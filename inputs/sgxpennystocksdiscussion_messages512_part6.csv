Chasen tomorrow still will chiong ma.. Still holding üòÇ,btohqsg
Nvm la bring up the mood,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt just evaluate based price falls. Everything is going to get ugly at some point. Even great companies.,btohqsg

All these share a similar trait....loss making for consecutive quarters  need to raise money thru rights or bonds and then you know la,btohqsg
Some one pressing purposely putting wall at 74 hope soon will clear this time,btohqsg
His shirt logo is Blue current  not under Oceanus,btohqsg
the thing is ah... Raising money through financing is not a bad thing,btohqsg
a lot of infrastructure company do that,btohqsg
but once they miss one payment or their cash flow get disrutped. ggwp,btohqsg
Will chase .. BB likes ppl chase .. .. gogo,btohqsg
So you have 3 choice when facing these type of counter: Continue to Invest with risk  Reduce Risk or Skip it totally. My recommendation is to skip loss making money company  prefer company that keep building its cash flow which comes with a premium.,btohqsg
