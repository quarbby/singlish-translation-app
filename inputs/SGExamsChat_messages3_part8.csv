erm  kinda i guess  I'm serving my 2 years now,btohqsg
I'm trying to make full use of my weekends to beef up my portfolio and also gain skills for my future career,btohqsg
I understand that being paid might be considered moonlighting  which is why I'm opting for unpaid internship,btohqsg
You can always suggest to be unpaid and make clear your commitment. As long as no employment contract  should be too bad.,btohqsg
If it's relevant to the field you want to enter  go ahead  and cross your fingers that you'll get to learn something because not every organization can utilize interns well. In that case  buckle up your big boy pants and be super proactive.,btohqsg
Cool cool  thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
I imagine it'll be really hard to land an internship position when my commitment is pretty much weekends only,btohqsg
Yeah  which is why I won't do it,btohqsg
Ns work on weekdays and intern work on weekends,btohqsg
Sounds like a recipe for burnout,btohqsg
