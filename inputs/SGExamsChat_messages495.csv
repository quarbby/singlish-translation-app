isok i was here when i was in sec sch,btohqsg
dawg everyone changed but I’m still here lying in bed,btohqsg
i been here since sec3 and my sec3 was dk how long ago alr,btohqsg
that was when i joined sushii city,btohqsg
i did not know wtf was telegram till i went to poly,btohqsg
i joined when bedok username was still bedok viewian,btohqsg
We should share our raya outfits  yo,btohqsg
imagine if yall had a security camera though the years..and one day  you can look back at it a few years later,btohqsg
omigod...yt tutorials does better for free,btohqsg
are they gonna include those trolley wheels,btohqsg
cuz this happens at a car showroom,btohqsg
I am but ys didn’t have to do me dirty,btohqsg
When you were old enough you were taking your psle as halimah was still in yishun,btohqsg
ok sorry la i don’t read all 500 messages,btohqsg
yes i know im old as well,btohqsg
halimah was staying in yishun before she became the president,btohqsg
says the one who always call us old fks,btohqsg
Guys what do you call someone who keeps on giving and not receiving anything?,btohqsg
if nsfs r forced to fight a war,btohqsg
watch the medics bring a ambulance to a battlefield of tanks,btohqsg
id shoot a civillian if im at war,btohqsg
guys was sg ever involved in the vietnam war,btohqsg
i think yall cant tell if that was a joke qns  well it was,btohqsg
is korean war a proxy war,btohqsg
doesnt mean we were indirectly involved no,btohqsg
indian minister fled to sg dont mean we’re part of it,btohqsg
nah  im not saying that this was evidence,btohqsg
i think because there is no keys to use them right?,btohqsg
nvm...cause i know some military vehicles dont need keys,btohqsg
cause ive been watching too many war related yt vids,btohqsg
i suddenly remembered somewhere i read that especially the road vehicles  they dont use keys,btohqsg
cause i thought you were saying...that it was not tough to steal one,btohqsg
wars that are older than the vietnam war dont really intrest me,btohqsg
and usually me...the vehicles are what capture my attention regarding wars,btohqsg
so because of this  dont really intrest me either,btohqsg
how tf am i suppose to prove lmao,btohqsg
btw dw  i dont dumptruck them with all these facts,btohqsg
its real  i really just talk normally lmao,btohqsg
like if you see me in real life i will talk normally,btohqsg
i dont bombard ppl with all these info,btohqsg
at least im not banned from a tele grp yet,btohqsg
didn't r say he was banned in like a few grp chats,btohqsg
you dont get banned for talking normally or casual talk,btohqsg
im just very chill with whatever i post,btohqsg
if people spam too much they also get banned I believe,btohqsg
Bruh I legit don’t know what proof you want lmao,btohqsg
why cant ppl write in better english,btohqsg
idk nd honestly idc i dont hve the energy for this anymore,btohqsg
If you are talking constantly no,btohqsg
But once in a while yes,btohqsg
I got better things to do then specifically dedicate time to talking with women,btohqsg
this is very blade runner 2049 (2017) ingrained,btohqsg
Bruh I actually do  fck how to increase my gpa sia,btohqsg
Yea now my poly has changed the rules,btohqsg
Now it’s practically impossible to do so,btohqsg
Have already been doing  brought me nowhere,btohqsg
The resources of each lesson will only be released a day or two before,btohqsg
Rp is also one of the hardest poly to dropout from,btohqsg
It’s alright  the thing was I never even thought I could enter a poly,btohqsg
I thought I was going straight to ns after a sec 5,btohqsg
I literally never studied in sec school  I am surprise I got so far,btohqsg
Yea that was what I was going to do cause my father gave me the ultimatum,btohqsg
Either go poly or go ns,btohqsg
I went sec 5 so I got that criteria,btohqsg
unless you suck so bad they make you stay in aftc,btohqsg
nah im going to see how long i can go through poly for,btohqsg
im going to let the poly kick me out...cause no penalty,btohqsg
you know there is a penalty right?,btohqsg
yea hence why im just going to try my best right now,btohqsg
anyway half my class is not far from me...they all getting like 2 to 2.5,btohqsg
yea i know..so im actually going to put in effort to not get kicked out like 2 of my classmates are doing right now,btohqsg
they failed 4 modules and are upset the school have yet to kick them out,btohqsg
but they have already decided to ensure they dropout this yr,btohqsg
i alr said  rp is probably the hardest poly to get kicked out of,btohqsg
seniors have told me...they have people getting a diploma with a gpa of 1.8,btohqsg
knowing ppl can graduate with 1.8  now you know why rp got its reputation,btohqsg
its like the poly in sg that dont take education seriously,btohqsg
the lecturers are not the one giving up,btohqsg
subconscious decisions to not hand up work  they also no choice,btohqsg
yea the average is abt 2.5,btohqsg
in rp  y1+y2 will make up the majority of your gpa for y3,btohqsg
in y3  for rp students its a 6 month ungraded internship plus fyp,btohqsg
so you basically have no chance to improve your gpa tremendously in y3,btohqsg
i dont know how people do this,btohqsg
i had an upper study in camp who graduated TP with 3.93,btohqsg
and he showed me his transcript like ??? its just As,btohqsg
i got a classmate from a closed uni  bro did not even finish half a year before he came to rp,btohqsg
because of how open rp is...you will find a few overseas uni students in rp,btohqsg
and when they come  most of them 3.6-3.8 their y1,btohqsg
but still below 2 can alr,btohqsg
uni gpa 2 can grad alr,btohqsg
or dean’s list or smth in poly,btohqsg
Look at how many y1's we have,btohqsg
on the roll of honour just for one diploma lmao,btohqsg
that classmate that was from a overseas uni  i asked him...why of all poly's  you choose rp,btohqsg
he said  i was given money to attend rp,btohqsg
bro was basically conned into attending rp,btohqsg
but he is doing well in rp so far...after y1  still 3.8,btohqsg
Bro i just saw the most speechless tiktok i have ever seen,btohqsg
but then what if some of these people are inherently not good at studying? thats why they are withdrawing from society,btohqsg
Yeah i was thinking that too,btohqsg
Whatsmore is the application for it,btohqsg
south korea is paying ppl to leave the house alr,btohqsg
desperate times will call for desperate measures,btohqsg
they will def setup a panel to handle it,btohqsg
Sg govt paying adults to marry when,btohqsg
means our population has been severely declining,btohqsg
i never said that u said its a bad thing either,btohqsg
I genuinely like pipagao milk tea from koi,btohqsg
Man I feel empty. I am working 2 jobs plus going gym everyday but still feel like I am not good enough. There is no progress. I lowkey hate myself or maybe this is just one of those overthinking nights. Idk whats wrong w me but I want to still do more,btohqsg
But when will the market situation improve tho?,btohqsg
29% is also the dmg that a level 5 earthquake spell does in clash of clans,btohqsg
2 lightning 1 earthquake used to be able to break lv 12 air defense with ease sigh,btohqsg
now before they break them stupid workers start repairing them,btohqsg
Oh no girl choosing pfp at this timing,btohqsg
I wonder what could go wrong,btohqsg
I also need a new pfp,btohqsg
Any girls can teach me how to take a selfie,btohqsg

It comes natural once you've lost trust in everything around you,btohqsg
Then just do it  it's your own phone,btohqsg
What games? Cause I’m also a robloxian,btohqsg
Oh ok my fav is flee the facility,btohqsg
Great game indeed  mine is more of the driving games,btohqsg
And just some random ones I find,btohqsg
I used to play random Roblox games as well,btohqsg
Sure but I can’t add now maybe tmr,btohqsg
The game that levels will never be saved,btohqsg
My furthest was lvl 31 I think,btohqsg
Yea I hate that it will never be saved,btohqsg
I furthest I went was level 4,btohqsg
I saw some YouTubers play it and just decided to try it out,btohqsg
I started my first acc in 2015 I think,btohqsg
Lost that acc’s password and made a new one,btohqsg
And I still have the password to them,btohqsg
That's why it's so hard finding an unused username now,btohqsg
These 100 Plus accs range from2016-2021,btohqsg
Nice so you can switch acc,btohqsg
But yea I do have a main acc,btohqsg
Just don’t use it that frequently cause I’m developing games on the other accs,btohqsg
Heard that there are people selling their accs on carousel,btohqsg
It was a 4 letter acc for $10,btohqsg
No but I think he decided to buy limiters for it,btohqsg
Oh I personally wouldn't buy those accs,btohqsg
Yea and the facts that some accs don't have robux is just waste of money,btohqsg
I can use the money to buy robux,btohqsg
Nice meeting you  hope you enjoy your time here…my eyes is shutting on me  maybe see you tmr,btohqsg
I need to cut off my mind,btohqsg
ah yes  one slight problem...i got no one to take it for me,btohqsg
i got 2 tutorials later and they just changed the tutorial qns,btohqsg
i got no time to do what the heck,btohqsg

But its nt at every bus stop lah,btohqsg
Yo that was uncalled for but i'll scan through that later,btohqsg
There will be ppl takung down bus arrivals,btohqsg
we were going from Salzburg Austria to Stuttgart  then had to stop in Munich to change. Train to Munich got delayed so much that we missed our next train so we waited for the next one. Then while waiting for the next one we ate lunch then happened to talk to some of the train station officers that told us casually that the train was leaving 30 mins earlier so if we didn't happen to talk to them we'd have missed that too,btohqsg
and frankly lots of people missed that train because many reserved seats were empty,btohqsg
1. I think the problem lies upon her environment. If she wasnt encouraged to do such things then like its nt rlly her fault but its concerning as she does not know current affairs... She doesnt take interest in it so it cant be forced but definitely it is general knowledge so either ways she must make herself interested.,btohqsg
Idklah its alot to think abt cos not easy to boil down. Alot of thought proceds and my brain kena shotgun alr idw ti think sm but def an interesting thing to think abt,btohqsg
Thats on her. She has a close mind,btohqsg
But like she pamper her daughter,btohqsg
Same but got choice. Legally ur entitled to overtime pay above 44hourd,btohqsg
Tell her shut up ppl want to sleep its past 10 can kena public nuisance,btohqsg
Hi how are you im good,btohqsg
Same i also want to see,btohqsg
but its the same what got diff meh like srs srs,btohqsg
You can call brigadier general by name ah. Wah,btohqsg
They also learn surprise and hybrid qns what,btohqsg
Then means u work hard lah,btohqsg
Uk ur way ard or sth liddat,btohqsg
Think the diff betw Ns and Os r more the sources used iirc,btohqsg
Iirc my old Cher said smth abt how the sources r like more chim and wordy,btohqsg
I spent 10 minutes on loading screen becos i typed fugde instead of fudge,btohqsg
Cfm the daughter conplain ti mother nt happy then say the teacher sucks or sth,btohqsg
Tell her like auntie can u lower down,btohqsg
The mum also think everyone else fault,btohqsg
So like the teacher shld js say like,btohqsg
But if the mother want to complain her daughter grades are suckass,btohqsg
Lol but thats her problem she is the one not trying tho,btohqsg
But beats the purpose when she complains to her mum abt the teacher,btohqsg
Her attitude is the one that is the problem,btohqsg
Its ss eh. If she dk what primary sec tertiary gonez lah then she go wht school sia dk pri dk sec,btohqsg
The teacher gg extra mile eh,btohqsg
My own teacher will kill me,btohqsg
💀she think this one tinder isit match not match,btohqsg
Dont match then u ownself teach ur daughter lah,btohqsg
Without format fail with format is A,btohqsg
Should I ot tmr for 19/hr,btohqsg
My geo so boring until i doze off half the lesson broo,btohqsg
my take is that as you go further into the education system  it's less and less about relying solely on teachers and tutors to match your style,btohqsg
you need to tune your style to help you learn the best,btohqsg
My mom keeps comparing my brother to me sia,btohqsg
Then i feel bad for him,btohqsg
This tells me that im a procrastinator,btohqsg
It is my o level year,btohqsg
i mean yes but like this take i have is what i realised after fucking up A levels,btohqsg
I lowkey scared for my brother,btohqsg
but it's served me well since then,btohqsg
How much time does he have?,btohqsg
Im best in academics among my family but nobody cares. I get compared for attitude instead,btohqsg
there's always a point of comparison,btohqsg
tell him focus on his science,btohqsg
i'm as high up as can be academically but i'll always have something my family is comparing with so,btohqsg
i guess to a certain extent that is good because you will always be forced to attain a certain level of excellence,btohqsg
Wait Chem D7 english D7 ss C5 hindi also D7 physics amath emath geog A1,btohqsg
tell himt to focus on chem,btohqsg
My mum cry ask me teach my brother,btohqsg
I'm not really forced tho is the thing like i lucked my way into uni  somehow got self motivated to the point my family doesn't worry anymore  and pushed myself beyond uni,btohqsg
my brother also gave up on mt,btohqsg
and he said that he dont ever want to put in any effort into his mt,btohqsg
his mt right now is like E8/F9 alr,btohqsg
For this one  make him read a lot  like legitNewspaper everyday at least 1 article and practice writing a mini report abt it and analyze the structure with himAlso force him to speak proper english  confirm will improve,btohqsg
I taught him amath and he improved from D7 to A1,btohqsg
but he doesnt answer the qn,btohqsg
I love this. Iw to think like this person,btohqsg
Like hes goes out of point,btohqsg
when i was in sec schl i wrote summary notes on everything to keep it in my head,btohqsg
Should I do common essays with him,btohqsg
He is more towards science and math,btohqsg
to better stay in point  ask him to think; how does A relate to B?,btohqsg
i can't learn anything unless i write my own notes,btohqsg
or hone his essay planning skills,btohqsg
I need to know argumentative essay tips and format,btohqsg
Maybe ask him to try reading and analyzing these?Its A level but still pretty good for him to read,btohqsg
I like it but i like discursive more,btohqsg
Ask her eyes ooen big big,btohqsg
Science and techPoliticsEconomic Environemnt EcologicalReligiousMass media and Culture,btohqsg
the teacher also no telekinesis read brain,btohqsg
basically you answer the qn well,btohqsg
Ik got some hook thesis statement lah or sth,btohqsg
Like i love ss but i D7 it,btohqsg
and all the ss essays came from it,btohqsg
I also dk how maybe i nvr ans according to tje qn,btohqsg
My geo A1 but total is b4,btohqsg
ask why 7 of your questions came from the same popular book,btohqsg
then they say its pure coincidence,btohqsg
I have 2 days from now,btohqsg
next year got 15 different books of essays,btohqsg
I literally told all my friends,btohqsg
Iw to know sounds like a good book,btohqsg
i really have so little to contribute to the ss convo sia,btohqsg
say its unfair those who use school notes suffer,btohqsg
im giving second thoughts on jc,btohqsg
But idk how im gnna get through,btohqsg
my brother wants to go poly,btohqsg
How to jc then uni without amath thats my concern,btohqsg
i resorted to selecting choices for poly,btohqsg
Dk ah I ask him try his best,btohqsg
Ya i am thats the whole point,btohqsg
I have to pull myself to teach him as well,btohqsg
Do well lorh literally copy paste essay only,btohqsg
