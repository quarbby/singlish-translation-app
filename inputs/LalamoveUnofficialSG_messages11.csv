How do you ride with the bags spilling out like that? Elastic band?,btohqsg
Ya man. Tbh he was v smart  initial job wrote serangoon rd - somerset - great world city - bukit panjang so nobody wanted to take,btohqsg
Then he cancelled  booked another one as serangoon rd - somerset,btohqsg
And called to change it back to 3 stops lol,btohqsg
I dont  it fits in my bag. i have a huge bag  but if it exceeds the size limit for bike orders it isnt fair that we only get paid that much,btohqsg
