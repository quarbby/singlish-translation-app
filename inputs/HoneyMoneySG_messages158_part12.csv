CardUp is cheaper even at 1.85% fee unless you charge at least $1000 per payment  when compared to ipaymy at 1.75% fee.,btohqsg
But no more 1.8% after this month. I see Chris got 1.75% code for ipaymy tax via VISA,btohqsg
unless ipaymy got other fees not listed on their site,btohqsg
To reach $1 with 0.1% fee is $1000.,btohqsg
Their fees are stated clearly on the site  especially when you key into the system,btohqsg
Just checked. The $10.10 that is paying is a 4G network or 90 days 5G if port in from non Singtel. Wondering how he manage to get 5G forever by paying $10.10,btohqsg
When they upgrade the plan  they will also adjust the price based on the plan it's referencing to. So more benefits at cheaper rates.,btohqsg
can i pay other people's tax or stamp duty under my account? like my wife  siblings etc?,btohqsg
10th 1030am. I had deposited some 5$ on 9th so maybe I got kicked down the line lol.,btohqsg
Personal income tax no  the rest can submit proof of relationship,btohqsg
Did anyone use cardup for reno payment?,btohqsg
Sorry gurus another dumb question. I have booked a hotel stay with agoda using the lady's card. Payment would be in April so am I right that it would not eat into my current month limit of $1000 please?The reason being i have hit almost 900 for my trip booking this month and I probably need to spend another 500 on accommodation.Is it advisable to charge the accommodation bookings to April if that is the case (I am thinking of changing my category to dining for next quarter originally as my trip booking is almost and I would not likely be spending on travelling in may and June.)I am holding the uob kf card as well. Would like to seek your views please. Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG I noticed there hasn‚Äôt been a review on the BOC SmartSaver account  even though it seems to offer better returns than UOB One.If I deposit $100 000  credit my salary (‚â•$2 000)  spend $500 on an eligible card  and make three GIRO payments  here‚Äôs how the interest rates compare:BOC SmartSaverBase interest: 0.40%Card spend bonus: 0.50%Salary crediting bonus: 2.50%Payment bonus: 0.90%Total interest: 4.30% p.a.Total earnings: $4 300/yearUOB OneFirst $75 000: 3.00%Next $25 000: 4.50%Total effective interest: 3.375% p.a.Total earnings: $3 375/yearIt seems BOC SmartSaver offers better returns  yet I haven‚Äôt seen a review on it. Did I miss any key points  or has this already been covered?Looking forward to your thoughts!,btohqsg
The bonus uni is capped by calendar month on your preferred category.,btohqsg
Exactly my thoughts! I have been using this for almost 2 years now,btohqsg
if march you almost hit the 1k  then yes it would be wise to have your travel payment to be in april.,btohqsg
Oh I am hoping to change my category for the next quarter as my only booking for my trip would only be like another 500 for the whole of the next quarter. Thus I would like to ask is it advisable for me to charge the 500 to my uob kf card instead. Though it seems like a senseless question.,btohqsg
I'd charge it to uob KF tbh as long as you can hit 800$ spend on SIA group,btohqsg
Do you have any other cards?,btohqsg
Hello  Does payment with credit card through AXS for IRAS or any other services earn any credit card rewards?,btohqsg
Can the salary crediting be done by ownself?,btohqsg
if can get 0.8% for card spend it is 4.6%,btohqsg
Not much for online or travel. Only uob one card and hsbc live+ for now and crmc.,btohqsg
This is not covered yet and I shall look more into it,btohqsg
got check what is the price if pay direct at the hotel instead of via agoda? If can pay directly at hotel can use uob ppv via mobile contactless,btohqsg
Wow I really didn't looked into that. Thank you. I go take a look at it.,btohqsg
Some people sleep better at night without having any loans.To each its own.,btohqsg
Is there a fee needed to pay by using cardup? How much is the fee if use cardup ?,btohqsg
Maybe you should watch the video first,btohqsg
"BOC cards look kinda pathetic tho  so there may be ""hidden costs"" in using BOC cardsGIRO payments also giving up the opportunity cost to earn 1% straight up with HSBC EGA",btohqsg
Yes. If sleep better. Peace of mind. Why not. So really depends on yourself. This type of question really depends on your own.,btohqsg
no need giro lah  can do bill payment of cc,btohqsg
Hi For DBS woman world x amaze for foreign transaction Does it qualify for 4mpd online spend?,btohqsg
If I not wrong  DBS excluded Amaze. Did you check the tnc,btohqsg
Yeap. To each its ownSome of us are risk takers n willing to take the spreadSome prefer to have peace of mindNot too long ago when interest rates are so low that a lot of people on HDB loan switched to bank loan. Then when interest rate increased  they get caught out.So understanding one self is important.,btohqsg
They didn't know the trend that why. Now is deglobalisation. Inflation will be higher through for at least another decade.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows what store post on the same day for SCB credit cards?,btohqsg
anyone know about gxs and the pockets? main acct get 2.08%. normal pocket up to 8 pocket get 2.38%. boost pocket up to 2 boost pockets get 2.88% if 3mth tenure 1mth get 2.68%? they say if normal pocket achieve target get reward whats the reward?  any game mechanic to min max this?,btohqsg
The pricing not in public site?https://www.ipaymy.com/sg/en/pricing,btohqsg
From their FAQ. With the default 2.25% fee (no promo).,btohqsg
So cardup still better for income tax 1.85%,btohqsg
ipaymy 1.75% + $1 vs cardup 1.85%https://t.me/HMSGHive/2295,btohqsg
Keen to know if this is possible,btohqsg
The calculation of cpm is not accurate .Remember the fee pays to card up will also earn miles. So uob priv is actually 1.3 cent cpm for 1.85% fee,btohqsg
What's the difference if it is 150k?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  as I have done numerous transactions in my account  is there a way to see your exact MAB for the month of march for UOB one account on 1st April? Want to know what's my MAB in preparation for the UOB quarterly promo.,btohqsg
I think to maximise benefit if I have 150k  I would go for uob one unless boc offers the same interest rate with no limit.,btohqsg
Short term maybe. Long term no.Reason due to chance of missing gold. Don't think they have ÊìçËäÇat all. No surprise if gold at fort knox only left a bit.Same go to England as well.So this will result gold might have 2 pricing in the futures.Physical gold and financial instrument gold. One go up and the another one crash big time.Of course it might not happened at all. As no one will did the audit to burst the lies. Until black swan happened. Example like got fire or what got disaster or what. Then go check find zero gold bar inside. üòÇAnyway just my thoughts.It is not financial advice.,btohqsg
Hi I'm thinking of signing webull.. anyone knows what is the most cost efficient way to fulfill the 5 us trades?,btohqsg
the pricing page doesnt show that $1. it's hidden inside the faq    new users like us will not know  not transparent,btohqsg
