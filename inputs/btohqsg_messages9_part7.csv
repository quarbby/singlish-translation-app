Now that's call milked it to the max.,btohqsg
Hey all! can i ask if BTO windows can be changed? i only know about the flooring and toilet. can‚Äôt seems to find any article regarding the window. because i want to install soundproof window if i were to stay at low floor unit near the main road. );,btohqsg
and also   if i have more than 60k OA. should i max out my loan and don‚Äôt use my OA to let it roll the interest which is 3.5%?  or? any ways to cut down the interest? cause i‚Äôm confused with the cpf interest ):,btohqsg
Depends on your project. Certain projects have requirements for you not to change anything that will alter the facade. You will be informed of what you can't change when u collect keys.,btohqsg
if you can't get higher interest rate elsewhere  then yeah use cash for your housing loan so that your OA fund can generate 1-1.5% higher interest,btohqsg
I find that such method is for people who can still save up after the deduction for loan,btohqsg
ahh isee! i‚Äôm looking at melody spring yishun. so to say  not all BTO projects window can‚Äôt be change right? (:,btohqsg
Hi xw! if it‚Äôs you what would you do?if the unit cost 400k . you have 331k (20years) 468k (30years) HLE approved loan and 80k OA in total? (:,btohqsg
I think they are more particular about the frame and how it will alter the overall look of the building from the outside. Your id and contractors will know more about whether it can be changed or not.And yes  HDB officers will go thru this point with u if your unit is in such a project where windows can't be change. Or if u wanna build a new window at your service yard  what colour it should be.,btohqsg
ahh isee! cause i consulted the window company but they told me first 5years cannot change to sound proof windows. so i‚Äôm shocked how people staying near expressway tahan the noise. but i only left with low floors. bad luck bad queue number what to do ):,btohqsg
downside using cash to pay is you'd be lacking of lesser cash unless you can save quite a substantial amount,btohqsg
you have to see the amount of your monthly expenses,btohqsg
example if you are left with $2k cash savings even after the loan deduction that's very very good already,btohqsg
can rent out a bedroom and cover your housing loan  but on the expense of your privacy,btohqsg
why not opting for bank loan?,btohqsg
is it you took bank loan? which bank? (:,btohqsg
limited then better stick to CPF mode,btohqsg
another alternative is rent out bedroom,btohqsg
isee! thankyou xw and leong for the help!! üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If the flat application is under family nuclear or Singaporean + SPR;how‚Äôs the enhanced CPF grant calculate ? Full or half ?,btohqsg
what's full half? thought can get the grant as long as below $9k combined?,btohqsg
plus a year of consecutive working,btohqsg
confused for this table  thought if family nuclear of SC+SPR will only get half of the grant based since the grant will only disburse to SC CPF acc,btohqsg
so in this case  if let‚Äôs say the grant is 80k  then will be fully disburse to SC CPF acc ? üòÖ,btohqsg
but why half of the grant amount?,btohqsg
just because one of them is SPR?,btohqsg
The EHG amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over for the months worked¬†during the assessment period  i.e.¬†a 12-month period prior^ to the date of your flat application (see example 2 below).¬† The incomes of all working persons in the household (i.e. applicants and occupiers) are included in the assessment.¬† Families with lower household incomes will receive a larger grant amount.,btohqsg
wondering anyone with similar experience here and still can get the full grant for family nuclear of SC+SPR,btohqsg
Next time also can get extra 10k,btohqsg
extra $10k on the exchange of giving up one's citizenship,btohqsg
Oh eh sorry this one not extra,btohqsg
You need pay 10k extra when buying flat üòÖ,btohqsg
in this case if let‚Äôs say the household income is less than $1500  then the grant to be receive will be $80k and will disburse to the sole SC CPF acc ? nice nice,btohqsg
CPF OA will be wiped after giving you the grant to offset housing purchase price and downpayment  with option to keep up to 20k in your CPF.,btohqsg
thansk man  this is the answer for family nuclear of SC+SPR,btohqsg
np  did what I could while browsing phone eating brunch ü§£,btohqsg

This one will be hotly contested. Will be fiercer than the recent telok blangah beacon bto.,btohqsg
Just take ba. Since u got appointment..,btohqsg
A bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush.,btohqsg
Another thing to consider is how long do you have to wait... Is the flat in yishun is available more quickly than if you were to go for a fresh bto lottery?,btohqsg
Queenstown has more units and is far from mrt,btohqsg
We see lor. I think it will,btohqsg
U referring to application rate or number of applicants?,btohqsg
Either way  it's bad news for buyers.,btohqsg
Ok lah August has other good locations like tamp and kovan,btohqsg
Oh I didn't see other projects in the same launch..,btohqsg
