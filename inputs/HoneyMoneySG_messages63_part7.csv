this game quite dangerous  minimally pay a bit more than the min payment,btohqsg
If you willing to pay the high interest rate and hurt your credit score then sure...,btohqsg
i thnk as long as got hit minimum payment  wont hurt score.dont pay min. then will affect score,btohqsg
Pay minimum will hurt your wallet heavily.,btohqsg
But it will affect the rate of score gained.,btohqsg
yes thisthe interest is damn painful,btohqsg
Honestly if you can't pay full you shouldn't even use CC,btohqsg
Which channel is best to report? Via phone or online chat? Dbs don't have online chat though,btohqsg
Or set your limit to literally 1k lol,btohqsg
New DBS customer? DBS has online chat for years. Aka digibot ðŸ¤ªAnd their first stop for fraud reporting IS online chat.,btohqsg
that is typically what i do.....set to a really low credit limiteven if im unable to pay off in 1 month  i can definitely finish it in the next 1-2 months,btohqsg
If you not able to pay off in 1 month means your limit is not low enough..,btohqsg
If I use uob ladyâ€™s cc to pay bills on health buddy  will this constitute part of the $500 min credit card spend for UOB one account?,btohqsg
I know how CC works but not using debit card doesnâ€™t mean your debit card wonâ€™t get hack. They can still brute force and generate a number that could belong to you. But thatâ€™s a very low chance of it happening,btohqsg
If you re-read the message  avoid using debit card is not to prevent brute force fraud transactions. It's so that the money does not leave your bank account directly.,btohqsg
Hey  got a question regarding smart park 5.8% guarantee return.So first month for 50k is $241 and what about after the first month? I canâ€™t see any fund yield?Also  is there any mobile app for it as well?,btohqsg
Ezlink has an upcoming 10% cashback promo on 1-30 Sep  I've seen this before but it was for newly converted to SimplyGo users. However for Sep promo  I've read thru the T&C but couldn't find a clause stating it's new user only. May I confirm with anyone here that it's available for existing SimplyGo ezlink cards?,btohqsg
Hi! May I know if anyone here has tried using the UOB krisflyer + amaze method to purchase items from The Hour Glass before? Did you manage to get the bonus miles (after hitting the $800 min spend on scoot/SIA)?,btohqsg
Got it  thanks Chris.Do they have a mobile app as well  I saw your review on them  it seems only desktop version?,btohqsg
Hi. In terms of rewards/cashback  for Singtel bills  best card to use would be DBS Yuu ?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. Many people benefits from it. You can try to search usinghttps://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Poems mobile 2.0 or poems mobile 3,btohqsg
So it doesnâ€™t matter which app?,btohqsg
I believe number of enquiries to credit score (which will increase when you apply) also affects the score. Coz then like you said it's deemed that you're desperate that you're applying to so many,btohqsg
If you are after 10% cashback for Simplygo  why not consider UOB One at 10% cashback for Simplygo ALL THE TIME!,btohqsg
Good point  but I will be using CRMC for the bulk of my spending and wouldn't be hitting UOB One min. $500. Moreover  Paylah has the stamp cards for topping up ezlink $20*3 for $3 rebate,btohqsg
That's effectively 15% cashback for the first $60,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this. Will take time to get my updated UOB ATM card. Not going to activate debit card.,btohqsg
Unsure about DBS  perhaps you can call and clarify with them?,btohqsg
Np. Good to share as a community.,btohqsg
Is it $3 for topping up $60 in EZ-Link? Which is 5%?,btohqsg
I using digibot all these while there is no live chat option for me,btohqsg
There is mobile app on play store,btohqsg
Hi Champs If I am going to purchase a shoes in Amazon US  will it be better to transact in SGD or USD with an Amaze card?,btohqsg
Hi  I had deposited 50K into the POEMS account to tap onto the 5.8% promo. This was done via the QR code (paynow) provided on the poems site. I'm not able to view the deposited funds in the POEMS account. Does it take a while for it to reflect? It's been close to 30 mins.,btohqsg
Is the money deducted from your account?,btohqsg
Or do u use OCBC? Not sure if it's down again today,btohqsg
Just got off the phone. Philip Securities confirmed that the money is deposited. Just that it's taking a while for it to be reflected. Thank you.,btohqsg
Wow i wonder what is mine now.,btohqsg
Use Amaze and pay in USD  make sure you link a SG credit card with high rewards,btohqsg
Haha I think most ppl here should be AA,btohqsg
if the item you're buying allows payment in SGD you might want to use SGD directly. Amazon DCC rates are usually pretty goodYou can doublecheck the rate by swapping between currencies.,btohqsg
These 6 funds are just the ones highlighted.I am very sure almost all the major bond funds (global investment mandate) will have some Country Garden Exposure.However  because they are diversified  it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the fund price just because of Country Garden.If anything  you should already have observed the bond fund prices being in the gutter already due to bond prices world wide being depressed.,btohqsg
anyone has any advice on which broker to use to invest in the S&P and which funds to invest in? thinking of investing a part of my salary on a monthly basis but not sure where to put it - would appreciate any thoughts or insights on this!,btohqsg
I'm already working on a video for this  released next week,btohqsg
How do i solve the math problem by shieldy bot?,btohqsg
Lol.. i don't think it's that hard to read the instructions on the message,btohqsg
haha to be fair.. when i first joined Honey Money  I got perm banned because I didn't answer Shieldy Bot in time.. LOLHad to get Chris Boss to unban me before I could join again,btohqsg
If I recall the ban is only 1 min.. that's why cannot rejoin back immediately,btohqsg
it was perm ban for me.. LOL,btohqsg
