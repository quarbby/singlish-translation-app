"🚀Pika World Daily Update: 8 December 2021🚀Equity markets rose sharply as Omicron appears to be milder than most other variants  allying to the concerns that it might derail the economic recovery. Major indices cheer on the latest update  especially when more medications appear to be effective against the variant.🎙We have a Deal🕰The government is finally functioning again. Both Republicans and Democrats have come together on a deal to raise the US borrowing limit to avert a potential default on its loan.It comes after weeks-long intensive negotiation as Senate Republicans are unwilling to help Democrats due to opposition to President Biden's trillion-dollar social spending. Democrats will need 60 votes to pass the debt ceiling legislation based on the Senate filibuster rules. Nonetheless  Democrats in the House had introduced a measure that would require them to have a simple majority. Democrats will still need 10 votes from Republicans.The result is to raise the debt ceiling to a certain level such that it will not lead to automatic Medicare cuts. It will remove an overhang on our December political calendar if this clears.🚔Intel: Mobileye  the Cash Cow💵It has been a while since Pika World talked about Intel latest venture. And it turns out a piece of good news is brewing. First  shares of Intel had a good run as it is ""eying"" to take its Mobileye venture public.The UPO is planned to take place around the middle of 2022  and it could value the unit at more than $50 billion. Intel will still retain as the largest shareholder of the unit. The venture is in the business of supplying advanced automotive safety systems  which Intel had bought in 2017. So what they do is to create cameras on cars that allow adaptive cruise drive mode and lane-keep assistance  which are two essential elements for vehicles to drive by themselves.Pika World maintains a favourable outlook on the company as it further develops new capabilities for the group.The market has been a good ride for the past 2 days  and we hope you enjoy this good read.Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.",btohqsg
