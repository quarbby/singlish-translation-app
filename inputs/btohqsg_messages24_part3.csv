That makes sense :) So it's more of case by case then. Cos they can see our CPF anyways.,btohqsg
Just sharing... Many things based on hearsay tooSince some things cannot be found from HDB website ü´¢When HFE was first implemented  some people got different answers for similar questions from HDB too...,btohqsg
However  HDB wouldn‚Äôt increase the loan amount even if there‚Äôs a subsequent increase in income. There was always an income reassessment before key collection with HLE. Things have changed with HFE.,btohqsg
HLE doesn't increase loan amount if income increasesBecause HDB had already given a higher grant to applicant previously,btohqsg
Anyway  i don't see why HDB wouldn't do their due diligence and confirm that applicant's income hasn't decreased as compared to when they applied for HDB loan  say  3 - 5 years before key collection,btohqsg
Maybe next time BTO prices will be $800k++ close to $900k for prime areas HDB scary üò¶,btohqsg
Just wait and see  the future outram park area Pearl's Hill BTO price will be very..... expensive.,btohqsg
Pearl hill could be 600-800k with 12-15% clawbackSince havelock hillside 2022 already 531-730 k with 6% clawback,btohqsg
Initial launch is 6%  then 8%  now 9%.,btohqsg
"Maybe cause of ""experts"" who say it's too low.Adequate or not? Analysts mixed on 6% subsidy clawback for Rochor flats under new prime location modelSINGAPORE: A 6 per cent subsidy recovery ‚Äì imposed on the resale of flats from the first housing project under the Prime Land Housing (PLH) model ‚Äì has drawn mixed views from property analysts  with some believing it is ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù  and others saying it is not high enough.",btohqsg
But seems like people still whacking PLH despite 9% clawback  so they'll keep increasing ba.,btohqsg
Ya with clawback  BTO looks affordable.Instead of 1M BTO  gov can launch at $800 k with 20% clawback üòÇif not $700 k with 30% clawback,btohqsg
Even with increased grants  it's still more expensive than previous bto launch last year...,btohqsg
Floor is a factorLower floor is cheaperPrice increases with each floor up,btohqsg
500k is lowest floor  600k is highest floor.Example  24th floor block.Same stack or unit number  24th 23rd same price  22nd drop 3k  21st drop another 3k  until you reach lower floors like 6th floor where every floor difference is 10k plus.Unit with desirable features like corner unit vs others on the same floor can be another 10k difference.,btohqsg
My HFE letter expire on 20th October. High chance October launch will be few days after 20th. What is the procedure? Can I cancel current HFE and re apply? Is this allow?,btohqsg
Anyone seen a 30-40 storey price difference per floor before?,btohqsg
Yes more desirable stacks are also priced differently.,btohqsg
Each BTO will price the increase differently. Usually top 2-3 floors are the most ex followed by a slight price drop,btohqsg
Just sharing. You may refer to tanglin halt cascadia BTO Project(Oct'2023) pricing. (Every BTO the pricing are difference.),btohqsg
On September 20 onwards will have renew button on where the HFE letter isCan renew from thereAfter this June BTO period you can just cancel your HFE and reapply,btohqsg
Look out for HDB given deadline for Oct 24 BTO application,btohqsg
I miss my chance for the june bto launch,btohqsg
Can i still apply hfe and try my luck for june bto launch,btohqsg
Just apply HFE now. If really missed then at least you can apply for Oct launch,btohqsg
"Hi all.Can I ask during key collection  do they still do the typical ""wipe out your CPF OA  leaving behind 20K""? Or was that only last time?If we have alrdy paid 10% downpayment and have enough loan for the remaining 90%  will HDB still do the wiping out during key collection?",btohqsg
Hi hi! I have a genuine question I'd like to ask!!! Under the couples scheme If 1 is a student and 1 is working  applies for BTO  are the chances of getting a 5 room flat  high?I saw that they look at our income and they said as long as it doesn't hit the max capital income but how do they determine if we are eligible for a 5 room flat or a 4 room flat?,btohqsg
As long as you can apply  the chances will depend on the application rate.Whether your HDB loan is able to cover the costs or you have to take a bank loan is another issue.,btohqsg

Hi! Does anyone know how to reapply for a second HFE? Currently our loan assessment is based on one party‚Äôs income. I was still a student when we applied for the HFE  but now I have been working full time for the past 3 months. Our current HFE loan isn‚Äôt enough for the flat size we‚Äôre going for and we are planning to ballot during the September/October launch. Any advice is appreciated üôè,btohqsg
If hfe expiring  when reapply. Its reassess one or the loan amount all will be the same as previous?,btohqsg
Will reassess. Loan amt might not be the same.,btohqsg
How long does it usually take to receive BTO ballot results?,btohqsg
2 months. Apply in June  results in August,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know if there are anymore SBF launches this year?,btohqsg
Hi can I check if I alr have a queue number from the previous BTO but it‚Äôs slightly out of the number of flats available  can I still apply for the June BTO?,btohqsg
June results will come out in Aug 2024  but does anyone know when we will be invited to select the flats?,btohqsg
Hi just a question   if my husband and I have applied for the HFE and it's approved but quit the job after 3 months due to family problem & then went to work grab for time being until everything settled then go back to work but different job due to the timing issues . Do we still need to re apply for the HFE if we intend to apply for the October launch as the June launch areas are far from the place we wanted,btohqsg
based on past launches: Depends on project  HDB will stagger the start date. They will share the month that it starts when results are released,btohqsg
Hi all does anyone know how to track for Chencharu Yishun ??,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how to see whether there‚Äôs any more balance flats for rail green?,btohqsg
Can try the group chat  SM's tracker MIGHT have an indication if there's leftoverThey also have an excel unit tracker (manual  volunteer basis usually) but you will need to check if it's updatedGroup chat:https://t.me/choachukangsep2023bto,btohqsg
Next year Feb . But not sure if I need to re apply if my husband income change then need to re apply for the HFE in regards to the financial income,btohqsg
Advise you to follow their timeline in terms of applying 1 month ahead  as they may require more time to process,btohqsg
Expiry in February 2025 means approval is this month?So  your husband intending to change job in August / September until things are more settled?,btohqsg
You can contact HDB maybe when his job is more settled or mid Aug and explain your situation to seek their advice since your case is unique. Either via HDB hotline or efeedback@Sillybendanzxc,btohqsg
