depending on the generation imho... i recalled the Sh9 was more aero than vw beetle 2012,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok.. I like it :) I love the space inside ahahaha,btohqsg
The SG9 was a legend :),btohqsg
Not true lor  I race people who have better car than me  but they still lose because no skills,btohqsg
@Chinese_spy_balloonu told me suspension cannot get used one right  only springs can,btohqsg
That one also not true ah  I never open challenge,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt anyhow leh say race race,btohqsg
Tomorrow is just to chill and relax,btohqsg
His car better also  I also cannot race,btohqsg
Your car now how pulling how many hp?,btohqsg
If he has a quattro unit I kow tow,btohqsg
I use 1.6L shit box can join?,btohqsg
I drive a QQ  don't like that leh...1.6L still better than me,btohqsg
Long time never hear that name alr Sia,btohqsg
Leg space ‚Ä¶ I too tall la..,btohqsg
Rickshaw only 2 wheels how to RWD,btohqsg
And rickshaw got the most leg room,btohqsg
Last year got ppl go OG,btohqsg
But they keep it on the low,btohqsg
Even the countach was at OG,btohqsg
Shall prowl the streets this year,btohqsg
Can I ask ah if my car only has 2 or 3 finger gap,btohqsg
My front is 2 finger gap  rear wheels is 3 finger gap,btohqsg
The norm I think is 4 fingers?,btohqsg
Normal for front to be lower than rear,btohqsg
Watttt. My car stock suspension front is 1 finger sia,btohqsg
Behind 2 or 3 I think,btohqsg
Haha good for u. Save money on lowering,btohqsg
Okay ah 2 finger is bad,btohqsg
Cannot lah hahaha. Now my house carpark they changed the hump into a higher one,btohqsg
2 fingers is a good gauge for normal cars,btohqsg
Close to 7 years of use alr,btohqsg
Then u just need better absorbers haha,btohqsg
like jelly on tpe that time hahah,btohqsg
Ya bro legit need To change,btohqsg
The cla suspension is super soft,btohqsg
Every hump is like going in bouncy castle,btohqsg
Actually no. Coz when I go over humps it‚Äôs as if my suspension is super stiff,btohqsg
No lowering springs than probably absorbers gone,btohqsg
Actually with my 2 and 3 finger gap still can put lowering spring?,btohqsg
Maybe your fingers fat like me hahahaha,btohqsg
Could be possible  but it wears out your absorbers faster,btohqsg
Ah nvm i just change stock. Save myself the trouble n shit.,btohqsg
Ya. Stock springs and absorbers are actually very affordable,btohqsg
Its not the affordability. I wanna have better handling but my sis cant sit coilovers,btohqsg
But because of the labour cost. Some aftermarket options don‚Äôt really cost that much more,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all about settings. And spring rates,btohqsg
It‚Äôs possible to achieve a smoother ride with coil overs,btohqsg
Then yes that‚Äôs a good price,btohqsg
Then lowering springs might be an option  but doesn‚Äôt mean your sis won‚Äôt like,btohqsg
Maybe start with strut bars and braces,btohqsg
That could improve handling and body roll a bit without virtually no sacrifice in comfort,btohqsg

For front just go join competitive eating competitions,btohqsg
There‚Äôs too many things in the east,btohqsg
Too many people and too many buildings,btohqsg
What is the address of your shop?,btohqsg
Not considered lowered to me? It‚Äôs like normal height clearance?,btohqsg
if your front is lower than rear  also means your car is pitching forward so your weight distribution would be as such towards the front,btohqsg

I gna change suspension >> Big brake Kit >> Tune,btohqsg
Feel like stock no braking power sometimes,btohqsg
"New by age or ""new"" in terms of tread",btohqsg
Didnt see the need to change,btohqsg
Sometimes dealers will buy very old manufacturing age tyres with good tread and put on stock,btohqsg
So that the tyres look new,btohqsg
no clue leh  but looks recently changed,btohqsg
i went to my tyre shop to take a look actually,btohqsg
Ok tomorrow I check for you,btohqsg
they say the tyres new  ask me dont change first,btohqsg
You should always check manufacturing date on tyres,btohqsg

If you think you're braking hard  chances are  you have another 30% of braking power,btohqsg

Anyone know vezel 2021 model battery can last for how long as mine less than one year now suddenly no battery cannot start car? Where can I get replacement battery in Bukit Batok areas. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
It all depends on what you have on,btohqsg
I did not put 24 hrs camera cos under warranty my dealer said cannot put.,btohqsg
I drive daily so I okay,btohqsg
So it doesnt drain drain battery,btohqsg
U buy external battery pack lo,btohqsg
But i heard only can last 8 to 12 hrs depending on battery size,btohqsg
See personal pref. Some cars i like some cars i dun like,btohqsg

Can you turn on your headlights,btohqsg
First time people who want to help more desperate than the one who needs help,btohqsg
How does the external battery pack work? It doesn‚Äôt connect to the car cigarette lighter port?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt see it often on cars tho,btohqsg
It charges when ur car is in motion/driving,btohqsg
Then when u off the car,btohqsg
The battery pack takes over if im not mistaken,btohqsg
I remember is plug directly to camera or smth,btohqsg
The battery pack powers the camera,btohqsg
And charged by your car battery which is charged as you drive,btohqsg
Like I say ah I dun use external battery pack,btohqsg
Unless u the thpe drive one day rest one week,btohqsg
Are there any dashcam which can view even when the car engine is off? Like I view from my house etc. my current blackvue 2ch can only view if I connect to the dashcam wifi. So I have to sit in my car if I wanna see whats on the footage,btohqsg
Ya. Like baby monitor can view live,btohqsg
There's a few out there that connect to cloud,btohqsg
You need to give it a network,btohqsg
I.e. put in a sim card,btohqsg
BlackVue dashcam that supports cloud sync,btohqsg
Walao eh don‚Äôt like that leh,btohqsg
So true!!!!!! Everyone so helpful here,btohqsg
Lol sounds like 24/7 dashcam not common. Like that the vehicles on Watch scheme by SPF like useless leh,btohqsg
Tapping on drivers‚Äô dashcam in MSCP to deter crime but‚Ä¶dashcams r not on lol,btohqsg
If u kena hit n run like me before,btohqsg
Just that most people daily drive the car,btohqsg
So the camera doesn't particularly drain the battery completely,btohqsg
Or they add in a battery backup,btohqsg
Most dashcams now have a standard parking mode  i.e.  low power mode,btohqsg
I gotta drive more often then. Bought 2nd hand car 1 month back. And I still take train to work lol,btohqsg
me too  just not used to drive. drive cannot look at hp,btohqsg
I'm more interested in connecting my car to the cloud...next stage can use PlayStation controller to remotely drive the car...üòÇ,btohqsg

If it helps you not crash and makes you a better driver,btohqsg
IIRC detect low voltage/ 0V on one of the electrical lines  if detected  switch to battery power source. Sorry I suck at electrical engineering  but roughly something like that,btohqsg
I put the circular one bottom right tho. Can or not ah,btohqsg
I‚Äôll have to check with blackvue on the price of a spare battery,btohqsg
Cos I also prefer 24/7 tbh,btohqsg
Also technically  you already have a Blindspot mirror,btohqsg
The mirror next to that is more convex,btohqsg
Most conti cars have it like that as per EU law,btohqsg
IMHO depends on your driving habits also...if you drive daily  I don't think it's necessary to get a backup battery,btohqsg
I believe about 300+ including install,btohqsg
If you go on a holiday  you might want to either disconnect the dashcam or let a relative drive your car,btohqsg
Have to disconnect the negative terminal of the battery too if go holiday,btohqsg
IIRC got ‚Äúsmart dashcams‚Äù that go into ‚Äúhigh power draw mode‚Äù to record on motion/vibration  but then $$$,btohqsg
Oic. The instruction manual suggest me put on top right,btohqsg
Most dashcams now have the activity sensor thing but I feel some are not very sharp with it,btohqsg
The recording is a bit delayed to the incident,btohqsg
yeah man‚Ä¶not easy to solve this problem,btohqsg
My other car grp got some auntie open the door,btohqsg

She told the auntie particulars come out say gna bill her for repair,btohqsg
Can make insurance claim if someone‚Äôs car door hit ur car?,btohqsg
You cut your toe nails leh mah?,btohqsg
Dashcam more for your own safety in case of an accident,btohqsg
It makes everything very seamless and easy,btohqsg
No need to look for evidence etc. easy for the insurance to judge,btohqsg
And that's why if you have dashcam  can actually get lower insurance quote,btohqsg
Yes but the bill not so high so easier for them to just pay off themselves,btohqsg
Or dispute counter party‚Äôs ‚Äúevidence‚Äù sometimes,btohqsg
I bet his big toe nail long long one de now,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I try to park the passenger door near to pillar  at least one side will be free of scratches. Then driver side door have to see luck whether your adjacent car got passengers or not. Chances r don‚Äôt have,btohqsg

hi fellow drivers  as a new driver   i am thinking if i should buy the old cash card since there are flashpay  one motoring card  EZ-Link for contactless paymenta. Are there still carparks in singapore that do not accept contactless card for payment ? Just don't want to get stuck when exiting a carpark.,btohqsg
the new nets motoring card shud be fine,btohqsg
Hi  can check what‚Äôs th diff between vcashcard and nets auto top-up?,btohqsg

You different  you're like a gremlin  cannot touch technology will fail,btohqsg
Some machines can insert la bro,btohqsg
And if cannot pay just press the button and complain,btohqsg
so i still need to buy the old cash card just in case :(,btohqsg
so to be safe  get 1 x old cash card and 1 x one motoring card?,btohqsg
Stop listening to@historyofmanhe has a bad history of cash cards not working,btohqsg
so i should get the FlashPay card (since can insert) or the newer one motoering card ?,btohqsg
I thought flashpay the latest one,btohqsg

Try next year. If next year rolls around and it still hasn't come down  read this message again.,btohqsg
u go see quota for 2014 - 2016 then u understand why,btohqsg
You think the gov will let it drop? Wishful thinking...,btohqsg
and they alr divide the quota up,btohqsg
so its a up and down cycle,btohqsg

Can afford to renew good already,btohqsg
from buying and selling experience during the coid  i believe this cycle is distorted,btohqsg
pls step down since obviously u have nothing new to add,btohqsg
most cars drove less 10k per year due to wfh,btohqsg
so the COR price trend...add 2-3 years should be right,btohqsg
so if COE i slower in 2016  add 2 years,btohqsg
imho just renew 5 years just nice buy new car in 2028,btohqsg

Golf is one of the most popular cars in Germany.,btohqsg

The Golf is to VW what the Corolla is to Toyota,btohqsg
Tiguan sold more units than golf lol,btohqsg
Victim of the sad trend of everyone moving on to SUVs,btohqsg
Nope  golf actually all time best seller for VW,btohqsg
All time bestseller until recently got dethroned by Tiguan yea,btohqsg
As the trend is shifting towards SUVs,btohqsg
Annual sales maybe. All-time definitely not.,btohqsg
But the Tiguan has a long way to go to reach the total units of golf sold,btohqsg

It shows history and heritage of a brand,btohqsg
btw. even more knowing that the overall car market back then is much smaller.,btohqsg
The best metric would be picking a specific market as well tbh,btohqsg
anyway  my point is: The VW Golf is a great car and has been a benchmark for many OEMs in that segment.,btohqsg
Sorry bruh Lotus and Mini are British icons but one is now Chinese owned the other is German,btohqsg
Because some markets get tiguans and don't get golfs,btohqsg
History and heritage don't mean much these days,btohqsg
I correct myself  it doesn't mean much unless my Honda civic shitbox from 20 years ago is selling at 16k depre,btohqsg
Car tyre kena nail. Usually how much do tyre shops charge to remove?,btohqsg
If already flat or leaking air don't drive,btohqsg
Call for on site service they patch on the spot,btohqsg
If you drive will damage the tyre,btohqsg
