Last time main board  and placement also like that,btohqsg
careful... may need to find support first,btohqsg
Like picking up a 5 cent coins on the floor,btohqsg
No wonder ausgroup and Smm went up,btohqsg
But why aspen unhalt just before lunch,btohqsg
I swee swee back in at 0.320. Avarga forever! Until the next TP!,btohqsg
Lol shoot up and give ppl suspense,btohqsg
A lot profit taking at aspen  buyers still buying 27,btohqsg
i see bro sgyuan chart put at 0.315 retracement...I up a bit and got it,btohqsg
20 is LB strong support thats why tough decision. Might be a flush play. Hard to say already.,btohqsg
it still might go there....they space out sharebuy back like 10 days apart so price might still be volatile,btohqsg
Never play Aspen this round. Good luck,btohqsg
Those bought Aspen at <=$0.2 huat,btohqsg
I follow@MysticDaxso far make $$ thats why ask him wahaha,btohqsg
EP 0.18 but didn‚Äôt sell when hit 0.3x that time,btohqsg
LB 21 supported by uptrend line.20 support.Got a feeling is flushing weak holders before they push.50/50 either way.My EP yesterday high 23. Manage to get some lots 22 . Earlier sell down 23 came and I got worried so cut some there.I think 21 is a buy honestly. See your risk appetite. Could go back up fast later if they are indeed trying to flush the weak hands at lower prices or stop hunt,btohqsg
Haha I hope so! That time was 0.36 also no sell I think?,btohqsg
Aspen not a fantastic company also,btohqsg
No need keep so long lah,btohqsg
True. Now need to set own TP,btohqsg
Cut back at cost earlier when saw Lb throw down.Just in case  play safe.Too many counters I am holding. I better start reducing in case worst case market scenario occurs,btohqsg
Any companies that make you money is fantastic la,btohqsg
