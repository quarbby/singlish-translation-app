No  I can only do it with one eye closed,btohqsg
cuz the other eye is opened,btohqsg
"""I want to drop out""- <1 week in",btohqsg
So h2 phy further math econs,btohqsg
I took H3 math is JC and a TOTAL REGRET,btohqsg
I cant agree more to that,btohqsg
But when i took H3 math  i really wished i had vinson lim as my H2 math teacher instead,btohqsg
Andrea u js joined the chat ah,btohqsg
I tot i joined but apparently i didnt,btohqsg
My math teacher was‚Ä¶.Lim Aik Leong,btohqsg
Meh not meant to be la,btohqsg
My econs was hopeless in j1  but only went ms tang took over  my econs soared,btohqsg
My current Cher is Mrs lim,btohqsg
Guess who i got in j1‚Ä¶none other than the rapper,btohqsg
one of my 3 fm tutors anyways,btohqsg
Oh wow i didnt know he is capable of teaching fm,btohqsg
"the guy who always puts great  emphasis on ""BUT""",btohqsg
Mr lim aik leong cant teach for shit  but i was his math rep,btohqsg
In jc i dun want miss a class and came to sch even when i was sick,btohqsg
I have this energy for a certain subj,btohqsg
But regretted coz i tot my fever no more but it came in the middle of class,btohqsg
Same ah but I tryna be more careful now,btohqsg
One thing i hate was my chers seem to hv gender bias,btohqsg
my civics/physics tutor is mr wong,btohqsg
I felt my soul die inside,btohqsg
I remembered once during math lecture  my class seated in middle right in front of the teacher eye  then kena called and no one responded,btohqsg
I'm not saying is perfect but,btohqsg
It was me who got called but idk i was too shy to raise my hand,btohqsg
The fuck UW to call me out in front of the entire cohort,btohqsg
Bruh this is why I damn scared of,btohqsg
Everyone thinks I'm just good at geog atp,btohqsg
Flame me with someone at least right,btohqsg
This is me for chem and phy but i gave mr lim yw a shock w what i brought to tutorial hahaha,btohqsg
Idc if it's good or bad,btohqsg
And my gp tutor was shit that i do my other revisions during his lessons lmao,btohqsg
GP + PW + CT = gg,btohqsg
Eh shit la actually my chem / math / gp teacher cmi,btohqsg
I got 1 Cher is myCT + PW + chi cher,btohqsg
Then now he a PSL Cher,btohqsg
My parents complain to pw head sia,btohqsg
Tan chee boon btw idk if UK him,btohqsg
Then it got transmitted to principal pam yoong,btohqsg
And i think that was how i got infamous,btohqsg
Like seriously whenever i walk past pam yoong  could see her eyes staring at me,btohqsg
Even during the college day and grad awards ceremony,btohqsg
I was going to say  do the opposite; JC was a waste of my time...,btohqsg
I saw the email the pw hod replied back suddenly got pam yoong,btohqsg
I think it's like a different perspective sort of thing; I hated memorising what i learnt in JC  where you don't really apply it  just memory work and then 10 years series for a good part of a year,btohqsg
Then bruh i wanna kms sia,btohqsg
There's little depth in what you learn  and just a lot of time doing busy work,btohqsg
If anything else. uni was quite chill for me,btohqsg
Tbh i feel that the poly people are thriving more in uni sia,btohqsg
Coz like uni is more of the ‚Äòpoly style‚Äô,btohqsg
But omo it is easier to qualify for uni through jc,btohqsg
Yeah  it's more projects  yes there's still finals  but finals are like 40%-60%,btohqsg
It's no longer 100% everything-weighs-on-that-A-levels sort of thing,btohqsg
Like i seriously took a real long time to get use to uni style,btohqsg
I think the slower pace of poly means you can pursue way more stuff on your own  provided you are a disciplined individual,btohqsg
Coz jc is more structured and easier to study / prep for exam,btohqsg
I guess JC is good if you just want to get driven along with the herd  into uni,btohqsg
After awhile  you kinda just go with the flow  school  CCA  study  school CCA  study,btohqsg
But actually i hv heard of people going poly finding sth doesnt suit them and change course in uni,btohqsg
But just that the GPA to qualify to uni is quite high (esp nus like nus is not poly friendly),btohqsg
meanwhile me  really didn‚Äôt like jc system but immediately loved the uni one,btohqsg
Like what even  a 3.7 gpa cant enter fass linguistics,btohqsg
if josh was still here ü§îü§î,btohqsg
Can u give me a goal for promos and buy me smth if i hit the goal/hj,btohqsg
It's really anecdotal at this point for me  and I am one point in this sample size  but I made lots of great friends from secondary school + uni  not so much JC.All I rmb from JC was the mugging and the worry I wouldn't get the course I want.,btohqsg
And I rmb everyone's else worries too lol,btohqsg
my sec sch and JC were the same so can‚Äôt really comment on that,btohqsg
but i went into uni leaving everyone behind,btohqsg
I detested that; it's stupid that you need some ridiculous GPA to enter some course. Because it killed the narrative poly and JC were similar in all aspects.Those were prob the reasons where pragmatically  some courses needed you to go JC for ease of getting in,btohqsg
And since this is SGExams  I suspect this would be biased towards JC anyway  likely most people here are aiming for JC/alr in JC and beyond.,btohqsg
which ppl froms as thrown into,btohqsg
u look at some of them is like 3.5?,btohqsg
thats still like a b on average,btohqsg
think i die die will go jc anyways lol,btohqsg
"its just me but if i go poly  will feel like im taking the ""easy"" way",btohqsg
I will say the Poly kids in uni always are the better adjusted people.Like the 10-20% low-eq folks tended to be JC. My theory was always that the path to uni through JC threw out people that were pragmatic  hard-working and decidedly unempathetic.,btohqsg
You know there was this stats that showed that 80% of guys from 25-29 were single. Recent stats.,btohqsg
And I just remembered thinking lot of people in uni were just unequipped to date someone  still have so much to grow as people,btohqsg
Read today‚Äôs roundup of Singapore court cases:A married man tried to kill his girlfriend by splashing acid on her and slashing her with a parang while she slept.https://cna.asia/3wloAnPA widow in an alleged sham marriage sued her late husband‚Äôs half-sister after she was left with nothing in his will.

The outcome:https://cna.asia/3uBufWt,btohqsg
poly u fuck upo one mod,btohqsg
its gonna stay with u till u get ur cert,btohqsg
it‚Äôs genuinely getting better though compared to years back like i can see a steady change in perception and how things are handled between poly and jc,btohqsg
probly parents bias rub off on me,btohqsg
Once again  my single data point- my JC class of 27 people had only 2 couples. So 4 people dating in total.,btohqsg
Oh not even 4  because they were dating people from other classes,btohqsg
So 2/27  crap sample size but there you go.Now in uni  my major has 38 people and maybe we have 6-8 people dating?,btohqsg
Err I dunno  maybe it's relative because NUS/NTU has less or something,btohqsg
But not that I know  at most it's 10-20% at most.My mom's malaysian  and I always thought it was really interesting that my 8 cousins  6 are dating,btohqsg
Wait wait what are you trying to say bedok?,btohqsg
I hate that all nus sci courses need to go through a cs mod,btohqsg
And then in Singapore  I have no cousins lol because my total 4 aunts and uncles all didn't get married.The difference is ridiculous.,btohqsg
It's Singapore and their technocratic experiment.,btohqsg
And my hope is just 40% to get the ‚Äòsatisfactory‚Äô grade,btohqsg
Everyone has to learn coding  everyone has to learn X and Y and become the perfect Renaissance Singaporean citizen,btohqsg
Dude ppl in my lab chatgpt and do the assignment while the cher talking,btohqsg
random but for class t shirt wld yall put ur full name,btohqsg
Then 11-12 supposed to be the time where we get to do work  3/4 of the class us gone,btohqsg
lmao this has nothing to do with singapore itself,btohqsg
Im damn dumb but i put chinese name coz i dl the fact my name start w an A,btohqsg
oh shit forgor my name here,btohqsg
i myself die die will buy lol,btohqsg
yall will never find out which yiming i m,btohqsg
You think so? I think our country has a habit of prioritising certain subjects‚Äî pragmatism amiright? Singapore's ultimate virtue.just look at Yale-NUS.,btohqsg
if i dont accidentally show itüíÄ,btohqsg
How dialects are banned from the radio,btohqsg
coding is just a very important skill as a whole going into how the world works rn,btohqsg
Meanwhile i hv thrown myself into a toxic course,btohqsg
and i mean yes we do prioritise certain subjects but that‚Äôs not really what the cs mod thing is relevant to,btohqsg
Btw anyone going tm homecoming 17 may,btohqsg
That long since he is there?,btohqsg
Yes my dp gave that away haha,btohqsg
I'll still be in sch what prolly,btohqsg
Idk why i chose it lmao,btohqsg
Actually ppl are escaping to industry coz it is more highly paid,btohqsg
Im the only one fr tm lmao,btohqsg
But there is another guy fr meridian,btohqsg
i put just my telegram name eh,btohqsg
Oh i tot he is current student,btohqsg
my full name might look btr tho reeee,btohqsg
Anyway I would call myself a meridian,btohqsg
Coz that pam yoong is SOOOOO shit,btohqsg
huh? i talking bout class t lol,btohqsg
I wished lim yan hock stayed,btohqsg
Got monkeys in my rota climb out of lvl 1 toilet from window,btohqsg
Then we supposed to beratur and march tgt to cookhouse,btohqsg
I would hv a better life w mr lim yan hock for the whole 2y,btohqsg
The bravo ppl js walk otot,btohqsg
It sucks even more seeing it being btr after i left (in terms of how the school leaders treat the people),btohqsg
Imagine pam yoong removed the subject awards during my j2 yr and then it marks its return the following yr,btohqsg
Imagine she making it big ‚Äòthe first batch to have gotten the trio (gold  silver  bronze)‚Äô during college day 2021  my batch got none of the ‚Äòjoy and honour‚Äô,btohqsg
She didnt even reveal my batch‚Äôs a level stats  pa system for 10s (and i alr know it prior through a jnr),btohqsg
But to be fair  TM was the worst merger (i heard that the teachers were hving conflict themselves???),btohqsg
imagine knowing to study at p6ü•≤,btohqsg
ok so all A for alvl then you buy me smth ah,btohqsg
Told u Mother is innocentHaters Evils Black Hearted U Curse Haters is OK but not üö´right 2 Curse their Mother,btohqsg
Actually it did in my yr but ofc i was not part of the pull down,btohqsg
But actually what i mean by worst is not the grade,btohqsg
Like more of how the merger turned out,btohqsg
so is it not worth going YIJC?,btohqsg
cuz that‚Äôs the nearest jc to my area,btohqsg
bc iw to find out abt ite life mah,btohqsg
i also in the poly chats,btohqsg
just want to know how its like to study there lor,btohqsg
the a level stats v bad,btohqsg
lol are you in the dhs one?,btohqsg
like most of the student pop cannot even go autonomous local uni,btohqsg
there isnt a chat for ours its just a channel where sc post updates on sch events,btohqsg
i rmb during ori the principal looked like give up on life then he nvr show us the nus igp or smtg,btohqsg
ya the as results v bad,btohqsg
theres one telegram for jh and sh lol,btohqsg
the campus is so run down lmao,btohqsg
so ijc the shittiest jc la,btohqsg
my sec sch classmates told me i was q demented when i told them id rather go yi than go poly,btohqsg
bc i told them i cannot go poly since im introvert,btohqsg
need to like present a lot,btohqsg
Tbh i would advice against choosing yi base on location. My friend REGRETTED it (coz the 2 closes to her place was asr and yi but she didnt get asr),btohqsg
but i thought got the presentation,btohqsg
Tbh i would hv chosen non-merger if i could lol,btohqsg
bro actually you are the only here that can argue for both pov,btohqsg
Coz i was in the merger mess,btohqsg
idek what course to do also,btohqsg
like all the poly course looks so boring,btohqsg
so i go take as lor,btohqsg
Cuz the merger is a while back,btohqsg
but ik my sec sch tchers told me that poly requires a lot of public speaking skills,btohqsg
so i heard that and said im not going poly,btohqsg
biz/life sci major + humanities minor,btohqsg
Sorry to burst Ur bubble but,btohqsg
so definitely not worth going ah,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooractl nus chs not that competitive right,btohqsg
but poly every module got presentation what,btohqsg
i heard ntu biosci is purely rp based instead of aba,btohqsg
then the ppl online r liars sial,btohqsg
but poly dh the course iw rly,btohqsg
nah idts is because their course is the one that need to talk alot like mass comm or biz lor,btohqsg
yk my online friend from a single digit cop jc says i hv hope even tho im in yi and he knows i have a ri friend so i can just ask my raffles friend for notes or smtg,btohqsg
i feel like a lot of ppl my gen lack nuance in conversations,btohqsg
Its not a sin to disagree,btohqsg
a lot of ppl in my sch like so sick n tired,btohqsg
go to sch with a sad face,btohqsg
but now pw only pass fail,btohqsg
when my h2 math cher was giving out our promo paper  she gave out a dude's paper together with a form to drop to h1,btohqsg
Stop ah or I sing tmjc sch song,btohqsg
bro we all laughed like siao,btohqsg
What is the b in bmtjc,btohqsg
I love such jc moment sia,btohqsg
my h2 bio cher said that i wouldn't make it for STEM,btohqsg
"and that ""im concerned about your h2 bio""",btohqsg
Meanwhile  i cannot my bro dunno how wear his collar pin,btohqsg
I manage to find my tm collar pin n video to him,btohqsg
no like i heard ppl say one,btohqsg
it took me 20min to figure out how to use my jc pin,btohqsg
Then he say he still dunno  then ask his friend put for him,btohqsg
doesnt mean u need to say.......,btohqsg
my own sec sch tcher say one also idk sial,btohqsg
my yi/jpnfriends in ns said the same shit bro,btohqsg
We thank y'all for the service,btohqsg
Nope my bro is smarter than me + affiliation  he is in vj,btohqsg
we the reason why pw and h1s are ungraded for RP,btohqsg
alot of yijcians r slackers lmfao,btohqsg
"man told me ""aiya dont worry lah  we are the feeders school""",btohqsg
eh my friend also from vj,btohqsg
wait so jpjc is btr then yijc?,btohqsg
I wished in 2025 batch  had a HORRIBLE PW journey,btohqsg
we the reason why our cop increased while the rest decreased,btohqsg
gave me a hard time too,btohqsg
remind your bro to wear the pin on his left collar  not right,btohqsg
"""oh every school is a good school""",btohqsg
I find it very strange that the boys sch vj is affiliated with has affiliation points whereas the girls sch doesn‚Äôt have,btohqsg
vj male is left  vj female is right,btohqsg
no like they look very sad la,btohqsg
A classmate of mine Kenna influenza,btohqsg
i also like to make fun of my own jc,btohqsg
because the buttons on our uniforms are opposite mah,btohqsg
Pls the number of retainees in yi,btohqsg
Uk i think idk mb 2020 was it (?) he posted on ig ‚Äòmy first time preparing graduation gift‚Äô,btohqsg
GOT A GIRL IN MY OG IS A RETAINEE LMFAO,btohqsg
My class had 3 tpjc ppl came back retake As,btohqsg
Wait  kuro for yijc can U take fmath w H2 math,btohqsg
1 guy in my company spent 6 years in mi,btohqsg
what is their promo criteria ah,btohqsg
j1  retainj2  retainj3  retake a level,btohqsg
But promo criteria is for show,btohqsg
My classmate all U also appealed to adv,btohqsg
Dude hearsay from lestin alumni that some dude retake each year end uk actly 6 yr pri sch,btohqsg
gg no wonder i got no hope in yi,btohqsg
They need students to have a sch,btohqsg
Too many ppl didn‚Äôt promote/advance lor  so got to lower standards,btohqsg
And also how can the sch retain so many ppl,btohqsg
EH BRO IS A PROFESSIONAL YAPPER,btohqsg
What's TMs retain rate even again,btohqsg
Aiyo sometimes you just gotta make the best out of the situation you're in,btohqsg
lol meanwhile all the merged Jcs had a principal change except for yi,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like moe can‚Äôt be bothered to send someone better,btohqsg
the campus v run down guys,btohqsg
i tell my vj friend everyday how bad the sch is,btohqsg
to make the jc so bad,btohqsg
idc abt the principal anyw lol,btohqsg
i heard ppl make fun of his name on reddit,btohqsg
YK MY ORI IS SO BORING,btohqsg
then other jcs go suntec city and stadium sia,btohqsg
bro yi ori so boring one,btohqsg
Stay in sch all the way ah,btohqsg
I mean if it makes U feel btr,btohqsg
Ori for this yr and last yr,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite stupid they even need turnstiles anyway. Not like sch is some kind of prison or office,btohqsg
at least bro is being straightforward,btohqsg
Should just open the doors and station a guard there,btohqsg
i need to reg the turnstiles with ezlink,btohqsg
our one also same from last yr,btohqsg
will not having any bio related extracurriculars affect ur admission to chs since its mostly aba now,btohqsg
cause i like bio but im not interested in med or healthcare at all,btohqsg
But actually besides thumbprint why not allow for ez link card too,btohqsg
huh ijc didnt allow ezlinkfor tiurnstile,btohqsg
Acjc side gate used to be a regular door that can be opened via card but they changed it to turnstiles cos many students kept abusing the door,btohqsg
Then they don‚Äôt want station security there,btohqsg
Idk I thought he say thumb for students,btohqsg
rly bro talks alot of shit,btohqsg
this guy is my h2 econs tutor sia,btohqsg
actl my sch teachers i always see them buying canteen food,btohqsg
i lunched with my teachers q a few times before lol,btohqsg
n the only thing i rmb him saying is he thought he can retire at 20 years olf,btohqsg
but i think having bio o can help u,btohqsg
cause i dont have like all those sci research progs like my friends,btohqsg
i alw listen in class man,btohqsg
so its true that got jc students go poly,btohqsg
if that happened to me im getting disowned,btohqsg
im already too much of a disappointment,btohqsg
bc my family all have very good grades,btohqsg
hope ur doing ok in poly tho,btohqsg
ppl say the econs dept is shit,btohqsg
n like the h2 econs notes damn long winded,btohqsg
issok iw to go uni so,btohqsg
my friend said go hg and search for ejc econs notes,btohqsg
i too stupid to do notes,btohqsg
yk i heard ej campus v pretty and modern,btohqsg
cos he wanna take music in ej,btohqsg
i have a vj friend who would kill to go ri,btohqsg
my friend went ri  APPEALED TO GO ACSI,btohqsg
but apparently he wanted to go hcicos of the chiobu,btohqsg
ib better for overseas apps yes?,btohqsg
bro prob want to study at ocbridge,btohqsg
imo you subject yourself to more pain than you need to,btohqsg
I thought rand was trashing the Econs dept not too long ago,btohqsg
because they also accept a level results,btohqsg
Said it‚Äôs the worst in sg but only good results cos the students are smart,btohqsg
the new rp system is good because the 4h2 ppl got no more advantage alr,btohqsg
The whole 2021 BOP cockup was the biggest fiasco,btohqsg
AAA/A with h3 dist can go to oxbridge,btohqsg
Yes or one H3 in place of the 4th H2,btohqsg
they only consider 3 h2 subjects and h3,btohqsg
Like my brother got B for H2 math but because of his h3 lit distinction can go,btohqsg
idk but i heard oxbridge they dont see ur h1,btohqsg
so if i take BCMh with H3 chem,btohqsg
ya esp competitive courses like chem/law,btohqsg
If 3H2 all A plus minimally a merit in h3 chem they will consider your application,btohqsg
then why jcs don't recommend us to take 4H2s (unless you're in a top tier JC),btohqsg
because most people don't want to go to a competitive course maybe,btohqsg
Almost all overseas unis don‚Äôt care about any H1 subject in fact,btohqsg
Only H2 can be seen as the equivalent of UK a levels,btohqsg
4h2 if you screw 1 h2 can dont count it in uas,btohqsg
then 3h2 ur h1 A h2 C also gg,btohqsg
h1 h2 is sg system i think,btohqsg
They have A levels and AS levels,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not exactly sure how everything works there,btohqsg
ur H1 cannot replace your worse H2 meh,btohqsg
cause uk most ppl take 3 a level mah,btohqsg
like they take 3 alvl subj,btohqsg
you go see 6th form subreddit,btohqsg
then when does the H1 count in the RP grading,btohqsg
Most ppl only take 3 subj,btohqsg
if u do well enough for your H1 to count,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bit stupid Cambridge requires 4H2/one H3 merit if 3H2  when they expect only 3 subjects for the local version,btohqsg
but a typical offer is sth like 4A* - 3A* 1 A iirc,btohqsg
you can put it that way lor,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs preferential treatment for their locals,btohqsg
I mean no shit they def have to prioritise their own citizens,btohqsg
but let's say i do well for promos  can i consider taking 4h2s in j2,btohqsg
Minimally A*AA for uk a levels,btohqsg
yea my school also keep saying 4h2 is not needed for scholarships or overseas uni,btohqsg
idont think moe jcs allow h1 => h2,btohqsg
but the perk is that with 4H2  the worst auto beocmes H1but 3H2 1H1 later your worst sub is the H2 then more damage,btohqsg
still considering if i should take H3 chem  but time will tell,btohqsg
why we talking about this when we all are over that stage,btohqsg
you can only choose h3s if it's good enough,btohqsg
wait then whats the bare min,btohqsg
i mean i can always drop it if i don't feel comf,btohqsg
just need to excel promos lol,btohqsg
i think for scholarships you just need consistent good enough grades and then pass wtv selection stuff they have,btohqsg
eh im more than halfway ok,btohqsg
i forgot to consider that one i was thinking of some other scholarships,btohqsg
my friends told me90rp - some scholarships88.75/87.5 - at least 1 scholarshipif you SCü§°üåö,btohqsg
the hardest thing here is the last statement,btohqsg
wait what's the max bonus points you can get for rp,btohqsg
no like for overseas uni what is the bare min subj to take,btohqsg
i applied last year 28/02 bro,btohqsg
3h2 1h1 can alr or need h3s also,btohqsg
you check your uni websites lorr,btohqsg
not that i can make it also,btohqsg
like i thought u can get extra points for rp calc or smth,btohqsg
but the not oxbridge no 4h2 also can,btohqsg
prob just the standard 3h2 and 1h1,btohqsg
depends on which course as well,btohqsg
i think might need because you are competing against sg students also HAHAH,btohqsg
because some are more competitive than others,btohqsg
max is 70rp but they incl ur mtl or ur h1 if it improves,btohqsg
and some unis are more competitive than others,btohqsg
lol gg imagine competing with rafflesians,btohqsg
i heard they all take 4h2s lol,btohqsg
