Sorry I have questions on this. Because I check on heymax app. On going facial at bioskin . Only earns 0.4 miles. Pls advise,btohqsg
Need bros advise on this.. I notice not the standard exclusion of citi rewards card  but if check under heymax apps  some merchants were shown as only 0.4 miles earn .. eg facial / hair salon . Pls advise ...,btohqsg
Offline got whitelist that get 4mpd. Not in whitelist then is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Uob one cc - SQ ticket no more cashback?,btohqsg
the original post was in response to a question about shopback payment. are you paying via shopback?,btohqsg
Why no cashback? Please go check the tnc of uob one and your card quarter,btohqsg
Can la. You try first. If cannot you tell me.Cannot trust heymax  sometimes not accurate one.Only when you tried  then it‚Äôs accurate. Don‚Äôt think  just do.,btohqsg
Then next time need to time the start date. Eg.. 16 Jul - 60days = 16 May(deposit date or subscription date).,btohqsg
So means I pair it with amaze using citi rewards card pay first.. then check the mcc code with the citi bank customer service?,btohqsg
Amaze card will show the mcc liao,btohqsg
Yes. No need check CSO. Just check your points balance can liao.,btohqsg
Yes.. never seen bioskin or Jean yip hair salon has shopback QR,btohqsg
Heymax shows you standard way of earning miles of that merchant. If that merchant does not accept online payment  it shows 0.4 miles. You can use Amaze to convert to online. Heymax does not include the Amaze hack info. It is not suppose to publicly advertise. The hack is for the ‚Äúsecret group‚Äù only.,btohqsg
Anyone uob acct earmarked for the promotion alr ?,btohqsg
Anyone got problem with Amaze App missing Facebook logo for FB login user?,btohqsg
I use excel for HSBC EGA. It‚Äôs where I keep all my liquid funds now. Almost daily movement so I have to use excel to track to ensure the interest finally given isn‚Äôt too far off,btohqsg
I think not fair to apply retrospectively. But yes is within the FI legal grounds.,btohqsg
I don't really give a damm... I will withdraw everything when my counter is at 0. If they never give me bonus voucher  I will submit a ticket... And after this matter is settled (regardless of outcome)  I will delete my account and uninstall the app. üò°,btohqsg
If they stated in the tnc  they are able to. If they didn‚Äôt  then we probably have a saying in this,btohqsg
Depends when you register for the promotion. Stated very clearly when your fund will be earmarked,btohqsg
Yes  funds earmarked and cash rewards credited on same day 20 May.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus.. In ibkr for cspx ticker commission seems to be 2.5 USD even in tiered commission .. I see@ChrisHMSGmentioned 0.38 USD in YouTube video. Am I missing something here ?,btohqsg

hi  anyone using dcs ultimate platinum mastercard? it‚Äôs 2% cashback without min spend capped at 200 per month  looks like it‚Äôs the best among all the no min spend cc (considering we‚Äôre not a high spender since we are looking at no min spend in the first place)is there any catch to this cc?,btohqsg
just make sure not in exclusion list,btohqsg
Difficult to cancel. You may end up need to pay annual fee from 2nd year onwards?,btohqsg
Confirm that from 30 Apr till now  your total amount never drop below Mar MAB + participating funds?,btohqsg
I heard the customer service is bad unless you call in for fraud then there‚Äôs actually someone to attend to you,btohqsg
yea i‚Äôve browsed through the terms and conditions for its exclusions  quite similar to other no min spend cc  just afraid that i missed out something,btohqsg
ahh i see  hopefully no need to call customer service for any help üòÖ,btohqsg
You applied liao ah? I was thinking of getting it too  the rewards seems ok but then the reviews of it not very good. Scared 2nd year onwards jialat when need to request waiver etc,btohqsg
