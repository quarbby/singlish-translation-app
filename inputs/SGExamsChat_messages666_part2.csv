Stage 1 is a full and detailed review of an application considering a number of factors  which includes: academic performance to date with respect to qualifications already obtained; potential academic performance with respect to qualifications in progress (including tutor/referee endorsements  predicted grades  combination of subjects studied and interim levels of performance); personal statement (including motivation/suitability for studying a chosen programme at Imperial  communication skills  extra-curricular achievements to date  career aspirations and potential contributions as a member of the College‚Äôs student body); as well as academic references and any relevant mitigating circumstances or contextual information.

Only the applicants from stage 1 assessment showing the strongest potential are invited to attend an interview and enter stage 2 of the selection process.
