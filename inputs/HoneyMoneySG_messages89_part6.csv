Hi should I accumulate Highflyer point or KrisFlyer points? Which one more worth it,btohqsg
The two are not really direct competitors mostly  one is for business spend and one is for personal spend,btohqsg
Hi Guys  my dad is 74 this year and has only $13k in his RA. I believe he is withdrawing about $300+ a month. My brothers and I thinking to top up his CPF via monthly $700 giro each. He will receive about $2.1k each month. May I know is there a way to increase his monthly payout?,btohqsg
Yes  recurring on LSE for USD shares is $1.70 (not inclusive of GST),btohqsg
Thanks for the updates on this,btohqsg
Like every other card? 3 to 5 business days?,btohqsg
Regardless of amount is that right?,btohqsg
Yea that’s the minimum if u are on the tiered comm structure. No more 0.38  IBKR fixed it already,btohqsg
As long as his RA is below FRS  any amounts topped up to his RA is eligible for tax relief (up to 8k). Topping up his RA also increases his monthly payouts.,btohqsg
Not sure what I am  will have to check. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi  am i able to receive cashback for using UOB Absolute for cashcard/flashpay top ups?The tnc excludes(a) all NETS and NETS-related transactions;Im not sure whether cashcard topup falls under nets.,btohqsg

So... You're asking ifNETSCashCard andNETSFlashPay are related toNETS?,btohqsg
"It may or may not work  but based on older (possibly outdated) data points (before the latest TNC). 🤷🏻‍♂️Since ""Any NETS or NETS-related transaction"" could mean paying via NETS or it could mean any transactions with NETS.Whether you get cashback or not  there's fees involved because you're topping up with an AMEX card  like what@oscar73freirementioned.P.S. The exclusion has been there as early as 2021  it may still be working.",btohqsg
Hi  i am going to book tickets with singapore airline about $4k  is it wise to use HSBC revo or DCS 2% cashback since i have both? And i read somewhere HSBC revo have cap of $1000?,btohqsg
Depend if u prefer cashback or miles. Revo bonus miles is cap at 1k,btohqsg
oh so it is true cap at 1k  what will happen for those over 1k? I am ok with both miles/cashback but with $4k charge just wondering if both have same value with 1k cap,btohqsg
4k will have better value on dcs card compare to revo,btohqsg
got it  thanks a lot Queenie,btohqsg
Yes  but Highflyer only can convert $30k to krisflyer per year  when I try to redeem the krisflyer point for a air ticket  seem like more worth it than just redeem the air ticket from Highflyer account,btohqsg
Newb here :I very recently got intro-ed to FWD Invest First Plus.Different ppl saying different things to me about this  is this 'plan' any good?,btohqsg
If you search ILP in this group you'll get all the info you need on why you should never get an ILP. 🤪But in short  fees  fees  fees and more fees.Initial account charge is fairly low compared to other companies  but the policy charge on the 2nd year onwards is disgusting.You can probably do better with robo advisors.,btohqsg
Can I use uob for HSBC credit card payment to earn card spending for uob one  bonus interest? If not whats the best way to pay it to earn some rewards or points ?,btohqsg
Hmm. Read this twice. Still don’t understand what you trying to do,btohqsg
Ya the question can be much clearer,btohqsg
U mean using uob credit card to pay hsbc credit card?,btohqsg
Has anyone yet to receive bonus interest coupon from the previous moomoo 5.8% promotion? My 60 days fulfilled 2 weeks ago.CSO told me still on computation.,btohqsg
1. I don’t think UOB supports payment of cc bill from UOB cc. I could be wrong.2. Any form of bill payment usually are not considered ‘eligible spends’. With exception of maybe utility or phone bills or town councils.,btohqsg
Exactly... neither works... duno what is his question tho,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i have 100k in ocbc  what is the best way to keep only increasing it by 500 each mth?Isit every 1st of mth deposit 500 inside  then whenever salary come in immediately take out?,btohqsg
