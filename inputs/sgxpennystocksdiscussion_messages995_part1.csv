Seatrium achieves underlying profit of S$200 million in its first full year resultsDisciplined project execution and divestment of non-core assets ▪ Decade-high net order book of S$23.2 billion1 27 projects with deliveries through to 2031 ▪ Proposes dividend of 1.5 Singapore cents/sharehttps://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/D3YE9CJZ5N5HQ7RV/833749_FY2024%20Results%20Press%20Release.pdf,btohqsg
Seatrium:Energy engineering giant Seatrium posted its first black numbers in seven years and announced a dividend  marking a remarkable turnaround for a company which has struggled with volatile energy prices  contract scandals and finally a painful restructuring.The company posted S$157 million in net profit for the year ended December 31  2024  marking a massive turnaround from a loss of S$2 billion a year earlier.More significantly for those watching the fortunes of this energy giant  it announced a dividend of 1.5 cents per share.All this came on a huge 27 per cent surge in topline revenue to S$9.2 billion as order flows accelerated during the year. The company won new orders worth some S$15.2 billion last year  raising its orderbook to a record S$23.2 billion.Most significantly  underlying net profit was S$200 million  again turning around from an underlying loss of S$28 million a year earlier.Why is this important?Underlying profit presents a company's core profitability by excluding non-recurring  exceptional  or volatile items from its reported profit. It provides a clearer view of the ongoing performance of a business by stripping out items that might distort the true financial health of the company.The stock has been one of the top performers on the SGX over the past month  rising some 20 per cent. It closed at $2.50 on Thursday. Analysts have raised the target price to the $2.90-$3.00 level.,btohqsg
