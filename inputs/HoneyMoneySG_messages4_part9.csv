Hi there. Can I check with the community on crypto,btohqsg
I understand that Christopher mentioned about using revoult card to top up CRO. Can we use YouTrip to do the top up without incurring additional fees ?,btohqsg
Moomoo tiger is better than dbs,btohqsg
YouTrip cannot be topped up by Grab  so there's no point in doing that,btohqsg
Any rewards for credit card > amaze > eAXS ?,btohqsg
I think us market data still apply?,btohqsg
If you dont subscribe  you dont get charge,btohqsg
You don't need live prices in IB anyway  can get from Tiger/Moomoo,btohqsg
When apply ibkr  it will auto subscribe?,btohqsg
As what chris said  can use Tiger/moomoo for live prices,btohqsg
Depends of whether u want to use it as a trading platform.,btohqsg
So if u use it as trading platform  there is live price fees?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the standard chartered smart card cashback applies for mcdelivery?,btohqsg
good morning everyone. landed here after watching YT,btohqsg
Chris. thanks. also thanks for the YT on credit cards. after watching  I immediately sign up for the cards ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Hi Chris  just like u  i have reached the BHS and FRS for 2022... is there any ways we can contribute n top-up some more funds into CPF accounts?,btohqsg
crypto is another world of investments which i have to relearn everything..,btohqsg
ETH  ETH v2  blockchain  smart contract  oracle  ... ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
My objective is not on tax but how can we add so that i can reach EHS b4 55,btohqsg
I will prefer cash then use it for investment. Fast better roi. Of course unless u are saavy in investment.,btohqsg
I have pull out from the mkt n reinvest in physical precious metals,btohqsg
Yes. Too many things to learn.,btohqsg
its like playing a RPG and uncovered a huge map,btohqsg
Chris can make some YT on DeFi,btohqsg
If you're not concerned on tax relief then just do VC3A.,btohqsg
For tax relief topup sa. Can it be done in separate batch in a year?,btohqsg
I started to use it for SRS,btohqsg
Hi Chris  are you able to do a video on how you reached FRS?,btohqsg
Anyone using UOB absolute cashback card for insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Read that they have .4 percen fees. Isnt that higher than using other platforms? Or they have certain pros,btohqsg
for cash investment  if you are okay with DIY then you can skip the fee  this is essentially intermediary fee,btohqsg
but for SRS and CPF e.g. investing into SP500 I think you can't invest via other platforms like IBKR or Tiger,btohqsg
U r correct. Tigr cannot use srs but local bkr such as poems can. So wondering is there any advantage to use endowus?,btohqsg
Thanks so much. Will be a good insight to it,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I understand from Pete from The Next Level Content Creator that we can use SRS to purchase the Canadian Bitcoin ETF.u got any info or research on this. Just to check.,btohqsg
this one need@ChrisHMSGto share his research,btohqsg
I used POEMS to buy 10 Units of S27 last week with SRS. Commission around 8 SGD.,btohqsg
POEMS referral at@sgpromocodeif you need one,btohqsg
I don't understand DeFi enough to make a video yet but KIV,btohqsg
Uob absolute > grabpay mastercard > insurance payment via AXS,btohqsg
I never heard of SRS able to buy any foreign domiciled product  let alone a crypto nature. But if that's true I would be happy to learn,btohqsg
Srs shld be all sgd. Listed in sgx.,btohqsg
I think if the product is (1) in SGD  (2) platform can access SRS  then you can purchase it with SRS. Use of SRS is not as restrictive as CPF OA/SA.,btohqsg
Yes. The purpose of srs is also to restrict funds from moving out out Singapore  in government perspective. That is why srs is also available for foreigner working in singapore.,btohqsg
Hi just a quz in syfe trade I buy US stock. How will I get my dividend paid to me ?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  usually how much margin did ibkr provide?,btohqsg
It is standard 100% margin for all brokerage.Which means example 25k have 50k stock buying power.,btohqsg
My endowus just got approved. However  I am still figuring how to buy into select funds directly using SRS. It keeps asking me to create Goals. If  for example  I want to monthly DCA into S&P 500 fund  how to do that?,btohqsg
You linked to your SRS account yet?,btohqsg
yup  linked already. Ok  after much tweaking  I found out how. Just have to create a goal  select fund  then allocate as 100%,btohqsg
