HiDoes anyone good at using calculator on laptop?,btohqsg
my calculator on laptop is python,btohqsg
Ehh...did you use this simple version one?,btohqsg
Oh I seeCan teach me how to use that kind of calculator? I have an exam tomorrow and I'm afraid that my casio calculator could not last long as I used it for many years already and I did not change the battery before,btohqsg
lmao idt you can bring python into exams...,btohqsg
You should learn to use Mathematica,btohqsg
Actually by right there is emulator,btohqsg
HmmWhy is this considered as cheating though?,btohqsg
Is a prototype of your casio calculator,btohqsg
the same reason why exams ban graphical calculators,btohqsg
Basucally a casio calculator in your computer.,btohqsg
i mean python is literally a programming lang anyway,btohqsg
OhNo wonder when I search on Google  there are many images that shows codingüòÖ,btohqsg
https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/users-choice/Scientific_Calculator_Casio_Windows.htmlDo you mean something like this?,btohqsg
def sum(a b):if ‚Äúa‚Äù = 1 and ‚Äúb‚Äù = 1:print(‚Äú2‚Äù),btohqsg
I will never understand coding as it's too complicatedüòÇ,btohqsg
Can I code my life instead - using Alphabets?,btohqsg
quite trivial  you achieve all life with a certain permutation of ATCGs,btohqsg
your exam requires you to use your laptop?,btohqsg
YesMy exam paper will be done on laptop,btohqsg

Can someone help me solve this?Consider a producer who faces a linear demand curve P= 24-Q  where P is the price in dollar ($) and Q is the quantity demanded. The producer produces this good at a constant average and marginal cost of $6. Determine the price and quantity if the producer wishes to maximize profit. Suppose the government imposes a tax if$Tper unit on the producer. How much will the consumer bear the tax burden? Explain,btohqsg
revenue function=Q(24-Q)= 24Q-Q^2 so this means ur marginal revenue=24-2Q,btohqsg
since profit maximisation means MC=MR  24-2Q=6 then solve for Q and sub it into demand curve to find P,btohqsg
after govt impose tax  just minus TQ from the profit function,btohqsg
Hmm okay. Let me try that,btohqsg
Sorry can I ask  what is revenue function used for?,btohqsg
I understand everything else below that. Just don't get revenue function. Why use revenue function? Under what circumstances?,btohqsg
to help you find the marginal revenue function,btohqsg
similarly  you can also find profit function and differentiate wrt to Q and equate to 0 for profit maximising,btohqsg
profit function would be 18Q-Q^2 so taking the partial derivative would just give 18-2Q=0 which gives u Q=9,btohqsg
"So Q = 9P= 15The tax will be shared equally (50:50) between the consumer and producer as their price elasticity of demand is the same.The distance from ""24 to 15"" and ""6 to 15"" is the same.",btohqsg
@adminsis there a rule that says ppl cant just randomly dm other ppl,btohqsg
not rlly but theres rule number 3,btohqsg
if u feel uncomfy or harassed u shld let the admins know bahh,btohqsg
