Hi guys  any knows for HSBC Live+ - to qualify for the sign up promo  I need to spend $500. Does the $500 need to be eligible spend or any kind of spend?- the sign up promo only requires me to spend $500 on the first month? Or needs to be 3 consecutive months?- does online shopping (i.e shopee  lazada) count towards the eligible spend criteria?,btohqsg

Hi expert  my citi rewards credit card fee got waived. I have received the refund but after the statement was issued. Should i pay the current balance (minus the fee) or the statement balance (with the fee) ?,btohqsg

For the $800 krisflyer sia promo before getting 3 miles/$  say if I fulfil the condition today  would the spending before today count as 3 miles/$?,btohqsg
Short answer yes. UOB only checks for 800 SIA group at the end of your membership year. Once that's qualified  spending for the entire year will get additional 1.8mpd 2 months after ur membership year ends.,btohqsg
May I ask 8%Cashback vs 4mpd. Which is more worth it?,btohqsg
How much do you value a mile? Then you can calculate cashback equivalent of 4mpd.,btohqsg
Okay ideally is it more than 1cpm?,btohqsg
The value is personal I'd say. Depends on which airline  destination  econ/business/first class.https://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI,btohqsg
Let's say your card is approved in July 2024. Your membership year is July 2024 - Jun 2025.,btohqsg
Generally 8 percent is value more then mpd,btohqsg

"There is a so call ""non-public"" method as best for tex payment. But I could not find it  so I try my luck here",btohqsg

Then 8% is better for u,btohqsg
