Oh cool  thanks!I suppose the key is at least maintain the same amount during the few years of waiting for flat completion,btohqsg
you can write in and they will tell you the same thingI‚Äôm a student now while my partner is working. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for our loan quantum to remain the same 5 years from now when we collect our keys,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs the main thing to keep in mind,btohqsg
I can understand if HDB makes exceptions for couples like you and your partner since one of you is not in the workforce yetYou guys could even do staggered downpayment if that is a more comfy arrangementBut are the same allowances made for applicants who have been working for some time?,btohqsg
As long as there‚Äôs significant income change  the loan quantum will change,btohqsg
but if you‚Äôd like some confirmation  just give their hotline a call,btohqsg
Nope  ha haWill prefer them to answer in black and white,btohqsg
Probably i will ask some people who had collected their keys recentlyMore similar profile... Non newbies in the workforce ü•≤Thanks  anyway!,btohqsg
Do you mind sharing the query that you sent?So that i can understand their written response in the correct context? Thanks,btohqsg
Thanks admin whoever you are haha,btohqsg
If income stays the same when during key collection  loan won't change? Is it possible that it will be lesser since age up another year? üòÖ,btohqsg
No if income no change don't need to reassess. You'll get the same loan,btohqsg
Oh really .. I remember the officer told me may reduce because of age also.. üò≠ I was like huh but income same wor. 2 years late got difference meh ..,btohqsg
Hmm... you might wanna write into get it in writing...,btohqsg
Cos we loose the total number of months of official earnings age ...I guess only hah,btohqsg

U know how to get BTO ?U need to apply 2rm flexi when Launch and if u are single only 35 years old above then can apply,btohqsg

99 years lease at least 100+K,btohqsg
Then u need to check those who applied already 2rm pricing around how much,btohqsg
I want to get as low as possible,btohqsg
Lowest $125 at Tengah. Lower Floor is not your concerns then no issue,btohqsg
based on may sbf 2023  yishun is the lowest,btohqsg
Have  provided you apply for 2rm BTO @ Woodlands,btohqsg
You may look out any BTO project  at Woodlands,btohqsg
This sbf so low $ means is not 99 years,btohqsg
Please take into account sbf (sale of balance flat) cost is also based on the lease balance factor/Repossessed unit etc...  u want the Lowest cost can try yo Apply just apply the lowest $ since is your concerns,btohqsg
Short least 57k 99y is 100k,btohqsg

Hi there  is anyone able to advise what type of window will be provided (sliding or casement) at the kitchen for 3-room bto.,btohqsg
Depends to Architect design.... usually is casement,btohqsg
Casement in the kitchen? Does not seem to be very practical if there are hanging racks outside. Thank you Thomas,btohqsg
Casement or sliding is the same high of wall... so is practical for all kitchen to hang clothes out side  is how we use the space,btohqsg
You are correct Thomas it is the same high wall. With sliding windows you can slide them to one side so easier to hang larger items however casement windows more troublesome. Anyway thanks a million for your response,btohqsg
That consider as personal preference than practicality of the design.Btw  I'm not Thomas,btohqsg
In terms of safety casement is safer than sliding  plus casemate provide full open for ventilation but sliding not.Just wait for the virtual tour to confirm your window ba ...,btohqsg
Thank you so much Thomson for your advise. Greatly appreciated.,btohqsg
GRACE...this Plantation GRANGE is sliding window at Kitchen.,btohqsg
Anyone have any recommendations for contractors that do soundproofing for hdb flats?,btohqsg

End of Sep or early Oct . HDB already say . Just wait till last day of Sep - 7th of Oct,btohqsg
Hi Tampines green jade admin please,btohqsg
Helloo does anybody know how i can redo my HFE prelim immediately or do i need to wait a month to redo it ?,btohqsg
saw letter from hdb say i need to pay xxx amount for levy,btohqsg
how does it works?revy i pay back goes back to mine cpf?  then i can use it to pay for new bto?,btohqsg
so this revy i paid when i sell mine exisitng HDB and get anothe rnew bto this levy goes back to cpf?,btohqsg
What levy is this? Is it one SGrean and one PR?,btohqsg
Or you talking about resale levy?,btohqsg
sg  here - when i got the HDB HFE letter it say i need to pay resale levy i tink,btohqsg
looking at anothe bto 3rm next,btohqsg
so just curious this levy i need to pay is it will goes back to cpf so i can use it for fund mine new bto again,btohqsg
You got buy a flat with grant before?,btohqsg
If you did  need to pay resale levy to hdb,btohqsg
so this rescale levy i paid back when i sell existing flat and get a new bto so this levy is not return back to our cpf or its fully taken back to HDB?,btohqsg
Yes  fully taken back to HDB,btohqsg
Payment of resale levyThe resale levy payable is determined at the point you book your second subsidised flat. It applies regardless of ownership type (joint-tenancy or tenancy-in-common) or shared interest in the flat. Payment must be made using your flat sale proceeds and/or cash. HDB housing loan will not be extended to the payment of a resale levy.,btohqsg
First subsidised flat was disposed of after key collection to the second subsidised flatResale levy deducted from the net proceeds upon the sale of the first subsidised flatAny shortfall to be paid in cash,btohqsg
First subsidised flat was disposed of before key collection to the second subsidised flatResale levy paid in cash upon key collection to the second subsidised flat,btohqsg
just curious normally before i collect mine key  to mine new bto i try to sell mine existing flat before i collect key right?,btohqsg
so after i sold mine existing flat then i collect mine key to new bto i can use the sales procees to pay the levy and the final payment to the new bto?,btohqsg
You have to plan well to sell your existing house before collect key,btohqsg
so usually before we collect key hdb will inform us right when we need to pay in full plus the rescale levy so i need to plan 6month before the key collections then if not i need to pay in full the rescale levyusuall hdb when will they inform us the key collections dates ?,btohqsg
Of course they will let you know the key collection date..This is the process knowledge i got from my agent:select bto unit > sell current flat > collect keys & pay,btohqsg
Possibly through applying for SBF which happens twice a year  usually during the May and Nov BTO launches. Some of the previous BTO launches would reappear in SBF  but of course subject to availability,btohqsg
On the day launch u can check,btohqsg
Erm.. u go HDB for? Everything is apply online.  U can‚Äôt enter without appt letter.,btohqsg
For SBF at the launch they will provide a list of unit numbers available for the available projects. You apply for the projects that are shown  then you get a queue number. Whether you can choose what unit you want is depending on how good your queue number is,btohqsg
First thing first  before we answer u,btohqsg
Do you know how the system works?,btohqsg
Talking to HDB can‚Äôt help you. It‚Äôs not like you can call them and say u want an appt then they create one for u then u  tell them you want to buy a house. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs more to resale ba.  BTO no agent de. Everything self service then HDB liaise with u,btohqsg
If like that  I think best way for u is to get a friend of yours to explain personally to u will be better.,btohqsg
Face to face is easier to understand as compared to here.,btohqsg
Which part of the website are you having trouble with?,btohqsg
BTO is open every 3 quarters. Once u miss the deadline means u can‚Äôt apply anymore and have to wait for the next quarter.  The next quarter which is upcoming Sept/oct is not open yet but soon.,btohqsg
You can only apply for BTOs during sales launches  of which HDB will let the public know of in advance. If you want to make sure you're notified  you can sign up for their notification service and they will SMS or email you when there is a sales launch,btohqsg
Btw does anybody know when will the next obf be launched ?,btohqsg
Oh it will not go back to your OA. It goes to HDB solely.,btohqsg
Yeah  when you go tohttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing  there is a link to sign up for the eAlert Service,btohqsg
How long ago did you register?,btohqsg
They are units design specially for seniors,btohqsg
Hmm  but anyhow  there is an upcoming launch at the end of September/early October so if you want to apply  you can do so then,btohqsg
https://t.me/SingaporeHDByou can also subscribe to the HDB Telegram channel as they post updates and info there as well,btohqsg
Okay  it should take about a month to be processed so once you've received it you can apply for the next sales launch if you want to,btohqsg
Hi  seriously u missed means missed already. Is your duty to manage your time well and apply before Launch ends.,btohqsg
Past BTO yes  pricing also can but need to find online.For upcoming one  during the launch,btohqsg
Only past and current.New one cannot see . Hdb haven't out information,btohqsg
Showroom is different from the actual launch.  If u are asking for actual then don‚Äôt have. Material wise  only when u get appt letter then u can go in see the doors and tiles only. That‚Äôs call the OCS package,btohqsg
If u just want to see showroom  there is one on the third floor(I think) of HDB.  Ranging from 2 to 5 room,btohqsg
Adding this for u in case u need to find your way there.,btohqsg
As mentioned by Vin  My Nice Home Gallery is a showroom  at HDB hub at toa payoh. but it only shows an example of what 2 room  3 room  4 room  5 room BTOs will look like. Not specific to the launch. See the above links and pictures for info.For specific launches there will only be 3D models (usually inside the HDB area ie access restricted to only those with appointments),btohqsg
Materials cannot btw. Different laucnh different materials,btohqsg
All thanks to those sharing over the years. üòù,btohqsg
To everyone who wants to apply for BTO or SBF... Please also try to apply for HFE earlier if possible,btohqsg
Yes this. Apply for HFE first and get it approve.,btohqsg
It's not open yet. Upcoming BTO launch is in end Sept/early Oct.,btohqsg
Next OBF might be next year since SBF selection havent even started.,btohqsg
I would suggest you call the hdb general enquiries hotline at6490-1111. If i am not wrong  you can choose for them to speak to you in our 3 official mother tongue (chinese  malay & tamil) too.,btohqsg
Welcome! Good luck in your BTO journey!,btohqsg

so 2027 the tengah mrt from tengah to jurong east will open in 2027?,btohqsg
Tengah to Jurong East opens in 2028,btohqsg
But we can hope for a late-2027 opening because the progress seems quite fast.,btohqsg
no choice lo... JRL is MRT line not LRT.   Also face many different challenge to line and link on the new and existing land use.    Still consider shorter timeline than previous Circle Line,btohqsg
just wish for better tomorrow and easy travelling for the next generation ba....,btohqsg
how is tengah bto looks ulu,btohqsg
Tengah currently may be Ulu due to non accessible by any public transport especially MRT.... however  with the new  archi design focusing on the Building Facade  Sunshade  Colour and Common Green(Farmway)... it will be an interesting Housing Estates in the West.,btohqsg
The value of the property in Tengah will be increasing from time to time at least for the next decade or two,btohqsg
Only thing that I feel a bit of waste is the Building Height of the overall Tengah,btohqsg
Yeah  that Tengah Airbase is annoyingly close by,btohqsg
It need to be somewhere... just happened to be Tengah.So take it positive we have free NDP show anytime lol...,btohqsg
Even woodland got sambawang air Base,btohqsg
Oops.... peiseh  today only know so many airbase,btohqsg

Hahaha... Tengah 1st few batches is only 0.4 mean only 40% application only  the project is still process and those leftover units is going to SBFs and end with OBF.I dun think HDB still practicing the minimum booking quota like the DBSS in the past.,btohqsg
ü´¢ oooh haha good to know this  cuz I've booked farrer park fields launch in Feb  should be no issue right  since quite central,btohqsg
mean you selected your unit and awaiting 2nd appointment for Sign Agreedment lo..... CONGRATs,btohqsg

Nope. No announcement means don't have,btohqsg
No Bro They havent announce yet.,btohqsg
They only mention end Sep/early Oct.,btohqsg
Actually I find it funny. Since Oct and Dec bto launch is so close to each other  why not combine both into 1 session?,btohqsg
Dun think so.... they have strategy to plan for location vs launch batching de,btohqsg
Tengah BTOs along Bukit Batok Road,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I rejected a flat selection chance 2 years ago  will HDB still count this as one rejection and if I rejected again means I will become a second timer? Or is there a time duration to how long that one rejection will remains?,btohqsg
Anyone know when will yishun beacon sfb release?Or is it already release?,btohqsg
errr next sbf is in nov/dec...,btohqsg
Just wait for the SBF launch then can check if it‚Äôs inside.,btohqsg

You'll drop to second timer status for one year if you reject again. Do call up HDB to clarify,btohqsg

Write to them via MyFeedback to ask which documents you need to upload,btohqsg
Amazing resource thanks! Anyway I can sort the table?,btohqsg

Any idea  anyone  of btos ever get delivered earlier than promised by hdb?,btohqsg

We've been waiting 2ish years alr hahaha. Keys collection is 2026. OK waiting la  just a bit shag,btohqsg
Regret not taking a resale then üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I was from HLE generationHad to furnish additional documents back then and was given this URLNot sure if it is still the same now,btohqsg
Yes still same but then they dk what to docs to provide yet,btohqsg
I thought person don't know where to submit  not don't know what to submit...Submission is not through My Flat Dashboard,btohqsg
The sms doesn't state what docs they need to submit as well I think...,btohqsg
There should be a reference somewhereFor mine  i was given a letter that says docs stated on AnnexFollowed the list and furnished those that i didn't submit at first,btohqsg
Anyway  person only mentioned they couldn't find where to submit on the Dashboard page...So sounded like they know what documents to add?But never mind,btohqsg
SBF is the upcoming one in December right? What does OBF stand for? And is there any way to check early so we know what's available?,btohqsg
YesOBF stands for open booking of flats. You can use the e-alert service to get notified when HDB releases what units are open for OBFhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/,btohqsg
No .  OBF is open booking flatU know what's SBFright? Balance of BTOSo OBF is balance of SBFSo how we know balance of SBF have what for OBF in advance.,btohqsg
Conclusion. We will not know what flat in advance till hdb acouncement,btohqsg
Hopefully by next year they could flatten the hills.,btohqsg

Hi   does anyone know how I can apply for the  schemes eg. Married child scheme  ftpmc scheme when I am ballotting for bto?,btohqsg
It should be automatically applied if you're eligible,btohqsg
Called hdb and they told me it's not auto. Needy apply :(,btohqsg
Oh sorry I misread your question!! üò± when you apply for the BTO there will be a portion on this. So you need to fill it in,btohqsg
Does that tally with what the officer said?,btohqsg
MCPS need to apply. FT(PMC) don't need.in essence  schemes with strings attached will need applicants to explicitly indicate interest. because you shld not be forced to commit to sth you aren't willing to  e.g. parents cannot move out of 4km radius for MCPS.for FT(PMC)  your family nucleus is alr like that and there are no other strings  so you are auto enrolled in it.,btohqsg

yes  confirm* can apply for dec 2023 BTO. rule of thumb is the new regulations do not apply to any launches before oct 2023* the only scenarios which you won't be able to apply for dec 2023 BTO are (a) you're a second-timer now and you reject a chance to select between now and dec  and this is your second rejection  or (b) you purchase another property e.g. resale,btohqsg

Sorry  i misread the yearAnswer - depends on your queue number  as per the new rulesHeard that BTO December exercise will be postponedNot sure about the SBFhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-launches-6800-bto-flats-with-tighter-rules-for-applicants-who-reject-offer-to-book-units,btohqsg
Hi hi... Anyone has any idea when the oct 23 bto results will be out?,btohqsg
they only mentioned by end dec it seems?,btohqsg
Just to clarify completion date does not equal to possession date (aka date we collect the keys) yes? Hahaha,btohqsg
Which also means we might need to wait for > the estimated 5 years üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
always wondered the difference between this 2  I think possesion date is not the key collection one,btohqsg
Haha yeh I think based on this source  it appears that there will be (1) completion date conveyed during launch  (2) completion date conveyed nearing launch  (3) then delivery possession date,btohqsg
As an aside  it appears that they lumped the stats for all the Kallang Whampoa tgt for this launch‚Ä¶  not very reflective of actual stats,btohqsg
Yes thats something what they like to do in stats reporting generally ‚Ä¶ if they were to separate all projects   the results will be quite different‚Ä¶,btohqsg
This is a standard practice all this while. Has been like that for years le.,btohqsg
i had applied for this round and actually they lumped all 3 projects into a single application too..,btohqsg
Then what‚Äôs the point of them saying the bto rail green I cck Oct 23 takes only 39 months to complete? Regardless ppl still have to wait 5 years plus to collect keys right?,btohqsg
sorry my point was that it‚Äôs not just the stats but in terms of application  they lumped all 3 projects in kallang into 1 under ‚Äúkallang/Whampoa‚Äù. So if i am eyeing say Kallang  while I may get a queue number  I may not get to choose the kallang one and have to choose tenteram which is my last choice for example.are you asking about the delivery possession date (dpd)? yeah it‚Äôs another period of waiting it seems,btohqsg
At least can see the flat lol,btohqsg
for the rail green I CCK BTO Oct 23 - Estimated waiting time : 39 months- Estimated completion date: 4Q 2027- Delivery possession date: 30 June 2029.Was wondering how early would it be if no pandemic  issues  etc everything go smoothly?,btohqsg
I think it might be 30 June 2029 (delivery possession date) :(,btohqsg
yeah  its the date  whereby HDB have to die die give us the flat  if not must compensate if its delay after. like the recent cases with the flats getting delayed after their DPD by the pandemic.,btohqsg
I think keys are usually delivered before DPD - HDB are legally obligated to,btohqsg
"there are two clauses in the contract  namely  delivery possession date (""DPD"") and estimated completion date (""ECD"")",btohqsg
in general  hdb provides a 'later' completion date so they would not have to bear liquidated damages in the event that it's not completed by the ECD.,btohqsg
but it is also likely that the DPD might come after the completion date,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can share the hfe which we applied for when it get approved  does the letter shows the loan for both NEW or RESALE? Thanks,btohqsg
Based on the HDB press release for Oct 2023 BTO  seems to be:1.) If we get a bad queue number but still within the flat supply (number of units within the project)  we cannot apply for Dec 2023 BTO.2.) If we get a queue number out of the flat supply  we can apply for Dec 2023 BTO. However  if got enough people drop out of the selection and we end up getting a chance to select for Oct 2023. But if we dont select because only left bad units to choose from then hdb will auto cancel the Dec 2023 BTO queue number even if its super good.,btohqsg
Point one is inferred from Para 9a  and Point 2 is inferred from Para 9b.,btohqsg
If the end of the day the same number it reflect the true demand.,btohqsg

Hi for those sc/spr applicants  the 10k additional premium need to pay during lease signing agreement or during key collection? Thanks,btohqsg
It'll be added onto the unit price. So you count your downpayment accordingly,btohqsg
sorry whats the premium for again?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like an additional cost to buy a house with SPR.,btohqsg
SC and Singapore PR applying for a flat have to pay an extra 10k which is added onto the unit price.10k will be returned if:1) PR becomes citizen2) SG baby born,btohqsg
Good morning  yesterday informed by HDB there a bal 2rm flat in fernvale vines  I have check out the flat  all seem good but the down side is it is on #4 and facing LRT.During 2019 launch the pricing start is between 102k to 151k  I wonder how much will HDB sell me,btohqsg
For 3rm does this mean that everyone that applied will get a queue number  or will some of the 2nd timer families will not get a queue number as only 15% of flat supply is set aside for 2nd timer families?,btohqsg
Some of the second timer wouldn‚Äôt get a queue number,btohqsg
but isnt it weird not to give the remaining Q to the rest of 2nd timers? the total applicants are lower than total units available  so everyone should be able to get a Q?,btohqsg
Yeah it would be weird if those flats goes into sbf supply when the bto applicants was lesser than the flat supply.,btohqsg
For first timers  64.5 individuals applied for 129 houses. That‚Äôs why the ratio is 0.5For second timers  83.6 individuals applied for 22 houses. That‚Äôs why the ratio is 3.8,btohqsg
So all first timers will definitely get a queue number  whereas only 1 in 3 second timers will get a house.,btohqsg
Q number is given to x1 of flat supply?,btohqsg
But realistically there are only 22 houses for the 83.6 second timers,btohqsg
Receiving a queue number might not necessarily equate to getting a house as well.,btohqsg
Formula cross referenced against the one provided by the HDB website.,btohqsg
what happens to the rest of the flats allotted to first timers?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a good question. Likely goes towards the second timers given that there‚Äôs an excess,btohqsg
And/or to those with priority schemes,btohqsg
I believe they will give all first timers the queue first. Then if still got remaining will go to second timers. Best to check with Hdb,btohqsg
Also it bears mention that the final ratio will only be consolidated by 2pm later today :-),btohqsg
means first timer except for Tengah 5 room is sure get,btohqsg
Think it‚Äôs anyone with application rate < 1 will be entitled to a house,btohqsg
So the 1.7 (Cck 5 room)  1.8 (Tengah 5 room) and 1.1 (Kallang 4 room AND tengah 4 room) might still receive a queue number but there might not be sufficient flats,btohqsg
The only group that belongs to the ‚Äúsure get‚Äù category would be the 3 room PLMH applicants for Tanglin Halt Cascadia ‚Äî given that only 85 applicants applied for 155 units  together with other areas where the application rate is < 1,btohqsg
The real lottery is the order of the queue number and whether one gets to pick first or last.,btohqsg
155 units available 85 applicants.Those low rate like 0.2 (Queenstown 3rm) for first timer families. Will they give the remaining allocated for 1st timer to 2nd timers.If total q number given out is X3 of total flat supply then everyone should get a queue number right?,btohqsg
Yeah  first timer <1 is sure get,btohqsg

Why there's almost 2 years between completion date and delivery possession date? It's like a bit deceiving when we see the waiting time from HDB!,btohqsg
Delivery possession date is the way that HDB covers their ass  because beyond DPD they have to pay. The completion date is more likely  barring any issues,btohqsg
So basically they are giving themselves a room in case something goes wrong.,btohqsg
I wonder how badly these deadlines were affected because of COVID in2020-2021,btohqsg

Hi  if my partner owns a condo and I buy an hdb under singles scheme and we marry will hdb require her to sell the condo?,btohqsg

I think you can try writing into HDB to clarify,btohqsg
Or you can put her as occupier.,btohqsg
Hi all  let's say I buy bto  and get hdb loan  5 years later the bto completed construction I go collect key  must I still working the same job in order to get my loan and grant? What if in during this 5 years I change job or lose my job?,btohqsg
Hi guys! I‚Äôm seeking for some advice from everyone! Does the applicant‚Äôs order make a difference for the HFE PRELIM CHECK? Or is it better to have a eg: higher salary  to be placed as 1st applicant? Thankyou!,btohqsg
Can change ah. U in-between change job no problem.,btohqsg
No diff  they look at combine,btohqsg
If not enough money and don't want take loan or cannot take loan  then cannot apply bto? Cannot tell them by the time 5 years collect key I will have enough money?,btohqsg
Grant will be disbursed to you between flat selection appt and signing of lease agreement appt actually  it won't be when you collect keys,btohqsg
So grant will be based on your salary the period of 12 months before your BTO application,btohqsg
And final loan will be based on your income nearing key collection,btohqsg
They will let you apply right now anyway even if you technically don't have enough currently  as that would be unfair to judge your ability to fund a flat 5 years ahead of you actually starting to pay for the flat.if you dont have enough loan at the point of key collection  then you will have to pay the remainder in cash at the point of key collection,btohqsg
Does HFE letter application needs to provide bank statement? Thankyou in advance!,btohqsg
actually no need. just provide your 12mth salary & cpf statement.,btohqsg

To whom it may concern I have 2 questions would appreciate if it could be answered as soon as possible as me and my partner have plans to apply for the Dec 2023 BTO launch.1. HFE requires for both applicants to be 21 years old. I am above the required age but my partner is currently 20 hence does not meet the requirements. Is there any possibility for me to apply for HFE?2. We both just started our first full time jobs. Working in the government sector hence we are bonded for a few years. HFE requires 12 months of pay and since we both just started our full time jobs does that mean we are unable to apply for the HFE?,btohqsg
Anybody knows the more accurate dates (to the month) of bto bidadari mop?,btohqsg
Can I ask about applying HFE  the occupier is a full-time student and working as 3 months internship and sometime work part-time  need to indicate the income?,btohqsg

it's okay. since you both are very young  keep working & hustling so that you can save $$$$$$ & afford to pay the loan in time to come :),btohqsg

hi all  would like to ask  after i've book a flat & paid the 2k  am i still allowed to change jobs?,btohqsg
Yes you can. They will reassess your income only nearing key collection  for locking in the loan amt,btohqsg
Is there a case of the loan amount being insufficient for the flat booked during sales launch couple years back due to job changes? What happens then?,btohqsg
Yes  it's possible. In any case where your loan + grants (if any) dont cover the full cost of the flat  need to pay the balance in full at key collection,btohqsg
Pay the balance in cashAnyway  should aim for same or higher income when changing jobsIf income becomes lower during reassessment when nearer key collection  the loan amount allowed will also be lesser,btohqsg

hdb has not updated the status of toh guan bto whether they have found a new contractor or not,btohqsg
HDB delayed in approving their HFE for Oct BTO application. So a few days after Oct BTO closed  HDB called applicants to say their HFE is finally approved and asked them to apply for the Oct BTO even tho publicly is closed,btohqsg
But how many are these out of the total number of ppl who applied ? Is it even 1%?,btohqsg
lol idk but it affects the odds nonetheless? i wouldnt be ok to give up even 1 position in my queue  if that's what you're asking,btohqsg

hi! i've always wondered why ur project is much cheaper than toh guan grove when the proximity is so close,btohqsg
Yeah  i think yours should be HLEHFE started May this year (if i don't remember wrongly)Unless you applied through SBF where waiting time can be much shorter,btohqsg
Yeah  same question came up in our Tele group... But i have no complaints ü§≠You guys seem much nearer the upcoming train station though,btohqsg
Alright  thanks! So I guess I should just wait for notification from HDB nearer to date before re-applying for HLE?,btohqsg
From what i understand  it is not new application (re-apply) per seMore of review or reassessmentBut yes  HDB will contact youOne thing that i heard from a few people from other groups though - they were told that they had to top up cash only few days before key collection üò∂üò∂Not sure what happened exactly (i didn't ask)In case this is a concern for you  you might try to check with HDB when they notify you about the HLE renewal,btohqsg
Any update on Woodlands Champions Green bto?,btohqsg
Hi  I'm looking at the next launch  when would estimated floor plan be released?,btohqsg
Hi WJ  the floor plan is published as the same time as the launch,btohqsg
Hello Any tele group for updates of Hougang Olive üòâ,btohqsg
Perfect  thank you for the clarification üôè,btohqsg
hi. need help. my approved hfe is 100k less than my prelim hfe üò± has anyone encountered this before? why does this happen? can appeal to hdb??,btohqsg
No problem!Also congrats on your key collection soon~~Coming soon~~ ü•≥,btohqsg
Erm  people don't always get the same grades during prelim and actual examsCan try appeal and stuffBut i don't think this HFE is really final tooAs in  income will be reviewed again when nearing key collectionI suppose a bigger concern if for SBF due to shorter waiting time for the flatOtherwise  review will be few years later and if income increases  there is a chance of higher loan amount eligibility,btohqsg
As long u can settle the deposit and stamp now and think future u can earn moreOr even throw in cash to cover the difference.,btohqsg
How about during unit selection if hfe amount is lower and can‚Äôt meet the required amount for the unit ?,btohqsg
Your HFE amount doesn't actually matter until it comes to key collection. Nearing key collection HDB will request a reassessment of your loan amount  at that point the loan amount will be what's actually loaned. Now the amount is just an indicator,btohqsg
During flat selection  you pay only option fee  ranging from $500 to $2000  depending on the flat type but you should have a valid HFEPayment for the flat will be something like -Grant(s) + CPF + loan before / during key collectionIf all these are insufficient to cover the cost of the flat  person pays the balance in cash(not sure before or during key collection since no personal experience on this part yet üòù),btohqsg
Anyway horIs there anywhere that i can view samples of prelim HFE and actual HFE?Curious how they look likeüê±üê±,btohqsg
sample? no leh as each HFE is tailored individually and only accessible via one's own SingPass login.,btohqsg
Unless ppl are willing to reveal  it's not possible...,btohqsg
In case HDB has samples or specimens somewhere or maybe some blogger shared baMy google skills fail me at timesNo need to see the figures baMore of  what type of details there are in the letter unless these are also not standardized? ü§îHLE quite straightforward - loanBut like not so for HFE,btohqsg
Hello bern   thanks for the info .So what u are saying is that eg my current hfe amount can be $400k  during unit selection I can select something that costs $600k.Only when key collection time my hfe amount must be able to cover the $600k loan ?,btohqsg
Yep  you can select something that costs 600k even if your HFE is currently 400kDuring key collection  either your loan + grant must cover the full amount remaining (ie price minus downpayment) OR if it's not enough  then you need to pay the remainder in full at the point of key collection through cash (I think CPF also can),btohqsg
Ok now I understand. Thanks üòä,btohqsg
As long your cash and cpf can cover I don't think is there any issue,btohqsg
But still do not over budget if you really think  u can make itDon't over stretch  your finances,btohqsg
Do note no advertisements thank you!,btohqsg
Admin  must do work or promote more admin,btohqsg

Hello Any tele group for updates of Hougang Olive üòâ,btohqsg
Can only find this so far:https://www.facebook.com/groups/3434514486833262/?ref=share&mibextid=NSMWBT,btohqsg
Hi for alessandrea vale   is it still available?,btohqsg
And what does it mean for extended family ?,btohqsg
Hi  is there a bukit merah ridge Bto group,btohqsg
Pls PM@danpatlooor@verlynhuien  they are the admins for the residents chat for Bukit Merah ridge,btohqsg
Good Morning Please advise Tengah Plantation Grove Chat Group?Thank you,btohqsg
Vincentdo message the listed admins to join their resident chat!,btohqsg
For a moment I thought which list is this üòÖ,btohqsg
Any downpayment required before key collection? I thought we have to pay 20% some time after 2k fee?,btohqsg
Yep you must pay 1st part of downpayment at the signing of lease agreement appointment - which is 10% (or 5% if you are under the staggered downpayment scheme)2nd part of downpayment is at the point of key collection  it'll be the remainder of the 20% downpayment,btohqsg
Sounds good: plenty of time to prepare,btohqsg
For some reason I thought they changed again and we need to pay 20% at the lease agreement,btohqsg
Thank God))) really hoping for CCK good Q number,btohqsg
"Anyway the appt for signing of lease agreement might be about 6-9 months* after selection appointment  so you have some time to prepare.*6-9 months was what the HDB officer told me  but do note that 6-9 months may be inaccurate now  I've heard for some people it's maybe 5-6 months. And also note if there are any ""complications""  it may also take longer  like mine was 1 year. This is because they will need to disburse EHG (if any) before the signing of lease agreement",btohqsg
Hello does anyone know when will the next sales of balance be?,btohqsg
Ya pushed to early next year. Usually is May/Nov,btohqsg
Oct launch results they say will be BY December. In means in November or in December?,btohqsg
Based on HDB's history  it will be Dec  maybe near the end of Dec haha,btohqsg
"Bleh) I wonder why ""computer balloting"" takes so long",btohqsg
bec got so many priority schemes in place,btohqsg
Could be! But no  usually when HDB gives a timeframe  best to assume it will be at the end of the timeframe. Eg if they say April  assume it'll be near the end of April,btohqsg
May I know where to see/check what is queue number now to select the flat,btohqsg
If you haveofficially received your appointment date  you can view the last queue number of the day from 12:00 AM onwards everyday  throughthis link. Help provide information by sending this toyour project's group chat  PM'ing me@smchua  or filling up thisGoogle Form. You will help the community determine the number of appointments for the day  and the dropout rate for your flat type.Updated as at 10 May 2023,btohqsg
^ you can view last queue number for the day if youve received your appt date,btohqsg
Otherwise you will need to rely on others who are able to view and share such information. Usually that's in each BTO project's chat,btohqsg
Anyone knows which other BTO has same layout? Prefer completed BTO. This one belongs to canberra vista,btohqsg
You can check mynicehome road shows  they showcase almost completed or already completed projects layout and 360 virtual tour. Not sure how far back they go back thoughhttps://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/roadshows/,btohqsg
Oh is it? Was under the impression this is a common layout,btohqsg
there are a lot of different layouts haha  some with bomb shelter in the kitchen  or at the entrance of the house  or further out into the living room  door aligned to kitchen etc,btohqsg
Or try looking at other projects launched around the same time or after,btohqsg
Hi wise ones  if for example my Q number for Oct launch is bad (like above number of flats offered in the project or close to it)  can I apply in the next launch?,btohqsg
You can still apply for next launch but will be considered as 2nd timer for a year.,btohqsg
Even if I'm unable to select a flat because of bad Q number?,btohqsg
Hello! Anyone applied HDB rental flats before? How does it work? I received appointment to go down does it mean we will choose there at TPY? or?,btohqsg
Oct launch applicants are not a lot  hence very high chance will be within supply for first timer. Those outside the total number will be given a chance too as some may drop out. As long as u have a number  cannot really participate in another exercise. Hence with this  I don't think you are eligible for the next bto unless selection cleared by then.,btohqsg
If HDB allow us to buy 99yr lease 2rm Flexi vs 3rmWhich is a bet choice since U will be singlev,btohqsg
Hear 2rm flexi 99year after we buy we can't sell to outside and only way is sell back HDB ask for shorter lease Right?,btohqsg
So we better pick a location we wanted to stay for Long untill we passed away,btohqsg
Hai guys any updates for woodland bro champions green?,btohqsg
HDB to extend validity of flat eligibility letters from 6 to 9 months to give buyers more time to secure homeshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-to-extend-validity-of-flat-eligibility-letters-from-6-to-9-months-to-give-buyers-more-time-to-secure-homes,btohqsg
HDB will extend the validity of all existing and new flat eligibility letters to 9 months  up from the current 6 months  to give flat buyers more time to secure their home.https://str.sg/iNwt,btohqsg
Only Short lease (15-45years) cannot be sold in open market,btohqsg
if you think you'll be single for the rest of your life  take 2room. if you choose 3room  the extra room that you have can rent out for investment/retirement but not for 2room.,btohqsg
Only my suggestion  you have to decide by considering what you really need or want. If you are a young person  and working  go for 3 room. As someone mentioned  can rent out one room if need money. But if you are 50 and above  go for 2 room.,btohqsg
ya i know but it rly depends on one circumstance & finance.,btohqsg
Oh 99yr 2rm flexi can be sell on open Market?,btohqsg
Ya  I'm singles working but 50 already so I think most will stay in This 2rm flexi hope location is goodPlus if 2rm even 99yr cheaper vs a 3rm I get more $ after sell mine existing flats,btohqsg
Oh then 2rm would be good for you. Cheaper housing so that you'll have more cash for retirement,btohqsg
You can rent out whole unit after the 5 year MOP right?,btohqsg
Hi guys   I understand now that the hfe letter validity will be extended. But if my partner has a change in income  does that mean we need to apply for a new hfe letter?,btohqsg
Hi  I couldn't click next page when filling in HFE application Part 3. When occupier is unemployed  I select 0 job  the Employment status no dropdown to select  hence save or Next button is not available to click and proceed. Anyone experience the similar issue?,btohqsg
Nope u can update yr HFE,btohqsg
I want to rent a house on the first floor of UBI GROVE 358. Does anyone know how to contact the lessor?,btohqsg

Another reno event coming. Seems like they are targeting BTO only! Got $8 888 luckydraw siaüò≤üò≤ somemore got Wells also!!,btohqsg
Also curious whether it's really that bad?,btohqsg
Just curious if I'm now 50yr old  buy 2room flexi with mine parent around 75yr oldIf after parents passed on will the House owner still belong to me,btohqsg
When I applying I willl put myself as owners and parent as occupies,btohqsg
Flexi got no resale value  it is worst than 99 years.,btohqsg
It's like prepaid rental for x years,btohqsg
So consider as buy and forget don't consider selling off beside selling back to hdb to take back something,btohqsg
3rm but no willing pay mire for 3rm want more retire sum after sell existing fast,btohqsg
Speaking of Reno. Please choose your ID wisely. don't see cheap only whack.,btohqsg
Usually alot of them  price low. Quotation exclude alot of things. Behind u realise alot of things excluded  then end up need to add on. Then u top up until become like  more than 50%. Those w freebies also  marketing gimmick at times. Take note.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. May I know how to deal with this issue as we can't tell what they really excluded  only do halfway then will know. Is it ask any hidden cost before even signing? Can they still say no but after that tell us after signing contract?,btohqsg
New owners really quite hard to differentiate. They can say no. Then behind tell u all sorts of things then u half way Reno alrdy lol.But I tot some helpful tips:1. Ask the ID for portfolio2. See the ID experience3. Don't go for cheapo deals. Even if u wanna go  make sure the ID has years of experience.4. See the company reputation on various platformsSome will go carousel find contractors then ownself try to manage. Usually alot of unknown blind spot if try to DIY. Unless do alot of research.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Actually reviews not everytime accurate too. Heard they call ppl to write good things too or purposely smear other competitor reputations.,btohqsg
Yah. Best is people recommend personally etc,btohqsg
Cause sometimes  company can be established  ID cui. Some ID good  but the company cui.,btohqsg
True. Even case trust ones not that trustworthy as I saw recently newspaper put case trust don't take consumer complains seriously  like useless.,btohqsg
I think as long end of the day got renovate accordingly  even slightly more expensive   also better than those who take deposit n MIA,btohqsg
Case trust  the most small claim only.,btohqsg
Hire lawyer also no use sometimes. U bleed more. So really .. ya. Usually MIA ones not much alrdy. But bad at project management ones  alot. And since ID is a lucrative industry  everyone wants to have a pie. Anyone will call themselves an ID these days. U see profiles from all over  claiming to be ID.Tts why I say  see the ID experience. Sometimes when they talk  u will know experienced or sales talk alrdy,btohqsg
I see..sigh... thanks for sharing these useful info!,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! Best to find those with transparent pricing upfront?,btohqsg
And don forget in which alot of people overlook. Never engage your ID friends or families. Unless u wanna throw your relationship with em away.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 11/11 and we did not forget you üíñ In the second half of 2024  singles can apply for 2-room Flexi flats across all HDB projects islandwide  not just in non-mature estates! We will also launch up to 14 000 2-room Flexi BTO flats from 2024 to 2026 to meet demand.#BTOgether,btohqsg
Yea. so true. Seasoned ID also knows this. It's an unspoken rule. Actually in business  as long as is own friend or family members  alot of times  it is better to engage people we dunno. Even contractors etc,btohqsg
Is there a groupbuy group for renovation cleaning?,btohqsg
Yes  you can text ‚Äúwazaoleh‚Äù to92223285WhatsApp. There will be this guy name Jaden assist you for the personal cleaning discount and groupbuy community discount @ your house area! :),btohqsg
(Apply for Sales Launch) Oct 2023 BTO: There are updates to your flat application. To view details  visit HDB Flat Portal > Login via Singpass > My Flat Dashboard > I am a new flat buyer.,btohqsg
I just received this SMS but can't see anything new in the portal,btohqsg
someone from sbf group also said she received this,btohqsg
just telling you your ballot chances,btohqsg
end of day  computer ballot ü•≤,btohqsg
Zzzz. Yeah just finally found where this update is. Not too bad triple chance,btohqsg
I'll show you what I see now,btohqsg
I received too. But no specific indication only saw ballot chance : 2,btohqsg
There should be details of application including assigned priority scheme(s) and ballot chances,btohqsg
Can i check what documents or things to prepare for the booking of flat?,btohqsg
Do check on your HDB profile  there'll be an invitation package with a list of what to bring in Annex A,btohqsg
Each person might have slightly different items to bring so it's best to check for your own personalised list there,btohqsg
Paiseh. Where to find thr invitation package?,btohqsg
It's on your HDB page. Can try overview -> my flat -> application status -> new flat -> application status -> click on reference number -> click your project name,btohqsg
but pls bear in mind on #2 as your ballot number exceeded. so you need to monitor first before your appt.,btohqsg
Just curious: can it happen that no units are available already when the time comes? Still need to come? I assume if they sent this invitation means units are still available?,btohqsg
Yes this is my concern. I'm a real first timer  all very new to me. Rules also change all the time. Previously one could apply for the next launch (ie December 2023) while waiting on Oct 2023 results. But now I guess we can't.,btohqsg
rules applied because they don't want some to be kiasu over application(s) & be committed when getting a property ü•≤,btohqsg
Not a good comparison compare to the new scheme  mow,btohqsg
Now first timer have more chance go get a flat,btohqsg
I think once the plus came out next the dynamic  will change,btohqsg
thanks for doing thatüôèüèª this is getting out of hand,btohqsg
Can restrict of sending link by the group functionOr ask rose to do so,btohqsg
I believe the admin here more pro than me,btohqsg
Unfortunately admins also have restricted abilities,btohqsg
Need to wait for big boss ability,btohqsg
Just curious: why is that so? For the first timer or the second timer? Or it's ppl with property hoping to get a great unit to resell?,btohqsg
Talking about the drop out rate in the pass,btohqsg
Whether is first timer or second drop out rate is for the whole project,btohqsg
Hi  did you send this to the wrong group?,btohqsg
Hi  jst join tis group chat  jst curious ;for feb 2023 selection now only u get the ballot results?,btohqsg
No the ballot results were out a while back. This is the flat selection appointment email.,btohqsg

No this screenshot is for the flat selection appointment for this person's Feb 2023 project,btohqsg
Ok thnks  I'm waiting for oct ballot results  hope by dec,btohqsg
They should have sent an email with the rough Month that the results are out,btohqsg
My queue no was beyond the flat on offer so until now i received invitation,btohqsg
