Hihi guys  just to confirm: dbs yuu card 18% rebate cfm follow transaction date not posted date? So transactions on 30 Nov still will count to the min $600 spend?,btohqsg
What are your thoughts on linking maybank family and friends card with amaze?Maybank F&F doesnt support apple/google payBut it is a good cashback cardWill I still get cashback if the transactions are through amaze?,btohqsg
It's a good card. Amaze pairing works.,btohqsg
Do UOB ladyâ€™s solitaire card need to pay annual fee when apply?,btohqsg
Anyone applied for a card through heymax? How long did It take to receive?,btohqsg
Depends on the bank actually. Which card did u apply?,btohqsg
That's true. I applied for Citi. 3 weeks ago..,btohqsg
Has ur application been approved? It is usually 3 working days for me to receive the card after approval.,btohqsg
just wondering  for trust cashback card  we can only select one categoryNormally which one you all will choose for 15% ?I assume should be shopping and will shop in fair price included ?The website only listExamples: Shopee  Lazada  Taobao  Uniqlo  AliExpress  Takashimaya  Decathlon  Nike  Cotton On and others.Not sure what is the others,btohqsg
They specified mcc list for each category I think,btohqsg
I think I found thisWith credit card  get up to 15% savingswith a minimum monthly spend requirement^ outside FairPrice Group#,btohqsg
"does axs clock the ""outside FairPrice group?""",btohqsg
Tbh  trust hid the mcc very well. I'd prefer pdf file like other banks. Easier to search.,btohqsg
Thanks  I have added to apple pay. In this case is it better to pay by linking f&f to amaze? Or directly using f&f?,btohqsg
Hard to say  depends on your use case. For example  if u are overseas in countries other than malaysia and indonesia  you can use amaze with f&f for dining to get 8% and avoid the fx fees.I dont have amaze anyway  maybe those with amaze can answer this question better.,btohqsg
Hi all  for overseas cards to use in Vietnam  which of the few would you all recommend? Between Amaze  YouTrip  Trust  Revolut and Wise? thank you,btohqsg
Amaze help to convert offline shopping to online shopping. Other than this  I would straightly use Apple pay,btohqsg
All these should be similar I think. I'm biased for trust and youtrip.,btohqsg
Anyone buy iPhone from Kris shop before? Seems like the price is much cheaper in shopee/ Lazada/ Apple Store. Budget ard 1.8ksgdWhich credit card should I use to buy to earn miles from Kris shop?CCard I can think of are:1) DBS wwmc2) Citi smrt cc3) UOB krisflyerAnymore?,btohqsg
This is why you should always keep your credit limits as high as possible with a bank and donâ€™t cancel your cards. Once in a while u get superb offers like this. 2.38% pa reducing balance balance transfer is well  great?,btohqsg
Price there doesn't include tax. It will be added later when checking out.For card  I guess UOB KF or Citi smrt. Depends on you like cashback or miles.,btohqsg
Oh my  no wonder. Alright thanks Anthony as usual!,btohqsg
If salary not much there is also limit on the arbitrate play for the balance transfer. So really depends. Some prefer cancel and sign up new card for sign up promo.,btohqsg
Can someone explain to me if i want to have U11 UOB   100 shares  is about 3.6k but when want to place. iBkr charges everything for 3.8k ish?,btohqsg
UserKayhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee links,btohqsg
Hm that's very fast. Let me try to call them. Emailing is very slow.. thanks Anthony!,btohqsg

Hi senseis  any tips for how to spend $800 for uob krisflyer without buying air tickets?,btohqsg
I heard buy from krisshop donâ€™t count?,btohqsg
How does this work? I nv do before,btohqsg
when you redeem your miles for SQ air tickets  you need to pay the airport taxes.. that one can use UOB Krisflyer to pay and count towards the $800,btohqsg
Ahh i think Iâ€™m confused. ðŸ¤£ kris+ means using krispay?,btohqsg
yup.. this doesn't count towards the $800,btohqsg
Wow cool. Good to knowww. Thanks so much!!,btohqsg
UOB promotions are not stackable right? Mentions in TnC but want to confirm.For example I registered for 5mpd overseas and then the Disney cruise one.It will only consider the latest one? (Disney),btohqsg
Nice  any way we can confirm?,btohqsg
well i got uob one bonus interest promo and plunging chicken promo...considered proof?,btohqsg
You asked questions here and still question the replies. Maybe UOB CSO is a better place.,btohqsg
what disney cruise promo? how it overlaps overseas dining/shopping?,btohqsg
Hi anyone tried vivifi or eight mobile? Which has better coverage?,btohqsg
Vivifi is singtel based while eight is star hub based. Coverage should be similar to respective network.What is ur current phone plan?,btohqsg
This is a no brainer to apply right? Can easily get 4% from high yield saving accounts... Btw the T&Cs stated if we repay early  will still be liable for the full interest... But I don't think HYSA interest rates will suddenly drop below 2.38% so can still arbitrage a little here.,btohqsg
1. exactly.. that is why i said this is a great benefit.. better than any sign up bonus for sure.2. no.. this is REDUCING BALANCE.. so the moment you repay (early)  the 2.38% p.a. interest STOPS accruingvs a FEE balance transfer (this is lousier),btohqsg
for a $100k balance transfer at 2.38% put into HSBC EGA...HSBC EGA 4.1% for 6 months = $2 050Maybank 2.38% BT for 6 months = $1 190PROFIT = $860 for 6 monthsDon't even need any spending.*figures are simplified,btohqsg
Hello everyone  Iâ€™m looking for a credit card thatâ€™s great for contactless payments (preferably one that supports SimplyGo) as a substitute for my Amaze card. Any recommendations?,btohqsg
In term of coverage?Eight has more roaming data in Malaysia,btohqsg
