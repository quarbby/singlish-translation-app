"Yes these cars are not meant for ""driving pleasure""",btohqsg
He has a big family  that's why,btohqsg
Like smaller kids also hard to put,btohqsg
Since you said want to cross customs with 8 people,btohqsg
I'm assuming you need some boot space at least,btohqsg
Only odyssey  carnival  estima will fit for you,btohqsg
Cheap  kids can run around at the back,btohqsg
apparently the newer ones got 300hp+ on sgcm,btohqsg
Starex I thgt only msia sell?,btohqsg
I saw on tiktok some guy paying 2.5k per month,btohqsg

vellfire/alphard is for when you big boss then got driver 😎,btohqsg
The quality of interior not that nice to me,btohqsg
Company car also ok  fetch guests etc,btohqsg
And you'd want to be in a nice place,btohqsg
If you don't mind a diesel and can tank the depreciation,btohqsg
Because resale will be very bad,btohqsg
Because of new rules on diesels coming in,btohqsg
my fam went to test drive grand voyager long time ago,btohqsg
but i think not worth the 2.8 road tax,btohqsg
Good cars on the Toyota side are the Noah/Voxy,btohqsg
Bigger than sienta so more room,btohqsg
And still have bootspace after using all 3 rows,btohqsg
The older ones is not the 2 seats one ah,btohqsg
And it’s like one individual seat each,btohqsg
There's some units for older ones,btohqsg
But newer ones the 2nd row is bench seat,btohqsg
The one I rented was like this for second and third row,btohqsg
Third row is 3 seats on the noahs,btohqsg
I forgot how comfortable stock suspensions are,btohqsg
The full size LC has a 7 and 8 seater variant,btohqsg
The new Lc300 hasn't hit our shores yet,btohqsg
Will be PI if it does,btohqsg
Yeap land cruiser 5 seats only,btohqsg
Was that why you went with the Subuwu? Your kids all happy in it so far? Or asking you to upgrade liao? 😬😬,btohqsg
Good morning sir!!! How are you feeling today?,btohqsg
My impression of Singaporean drivers.20% Horn to warn danger80% RoadRage/Horns are free of charge,btohqsg
You forgot the 5% when you see your friend on the road,btohqsg
Oh right that one 1 percent lol,btohqsg
60% Signal means I have right of way20% Signal after turning/changing lanes10% What is signal?10% Signals properly,btohqsg
If you buy a decent unit and you take good care of it,btohqsg
either see or say good bye (guilty of it too),btohqsg
You must not have many friends.,btohqsg
I always get that answer when I ask about any cars,btohqsg
I asked an owner of a rotary and he gave me that answer too,btohqsg
I still have the impression that older car technology will outlast new engines designs from 2010 onwards.,btohqsg
Maintenance is standard like any euro car. But if you’re buying it  look out mostly for rear springs and suspension issues. The stock ones have a tendency of snapping round the bottom due to rust. The control arms  roll bar drop links  etc all should be something you worry about. Just listen for clunks and knocks when you go over bumps on your test drives.You’re out of the rusteez period with this so no need to worry about that….err…engine should also run smooth  misfiring is not uncommon for the C180K  GB is also somewhat prone to leaking in some production years.That’s it…easier to PPI for these things. But also  with a car like this  preventative maintenance and repairs are Godsend,btohqsg

Sometimes sees the msg will be tends to forget again...,btohqsg
Hey guys  what is the usual practice for PPI? The dealer drive the car to my workshop on his own? Do we have to be present during the inspection?,btohqsg
Usually the case. Whether you’re present or not depends on (a) how kpo you are and (b) you trust your workshop?,btohqsg
Thanks. Not so much kpo but I scared the dealer pakat with the mechanics lol,btohqsg
You trust the ws  just send only,btohqsg
Unlikely if its ur own workshop.,btohqsg

In the hands of a responsible owner and a lying salesman  the car is in good condition,btohqsg
So it's up to the consumer to tell between the 2,btohqsg
Which car salesman have ever been honest about shortfalls of a car? I’d like to meet that one.,btohqsg

Hi Bros and Siss  can anyone recommend cheap car rental for personal use. Long term. $40-50 per day. Much appreciated.😊,btohqsg
What day and age still got such cheap rental ah,btohqsg
But the service gonn be crap,btohqsg
Those miles 200k and above one,btohqsg
Why dont u get a car?,btohqsg
Sgcm has some abt 9k ish for a year,btohqsg
Oh ok.. thks for your constructive input guys.. I go and check it out.,btohqsg
I’ve rented a car for 6 months before. With the amount spent  seems more economical to buy one instead. Short term rent is still ok but long term can get quite expensive even if it’s cheaper monthly,btohqsg
As in the fuel consumption no so good?,btohqsg
1.1k per month  with insurance  about 1.3k? im not sure about ur NCD,btohqsg
bro  old cars FC is never good. haha,btohqsg
this figure is based on 2k insurance assuming u 0% NCD/young driver and stuff,btohqsg
sorry  1.2k  calculated per month cost wrong haha,btohqsg
cheaper than ur 1.5k per month rental w fuel included,btohqsg
only rent if ur doing PHV  cus of ur mileage. best to let the rental company handle the maintenance and wear and tear,btohqsg
Yep! For personal use would be worth considering purchasing one,btohqsg
I rented close to about 1.7k per month last year for 6 months excluding fuel/tyre damage,btohqsg
But inclusive of servicing  insurance  tax etcetc,btohqsg
Service center is still up and running,btohqsg
That's a tough one - J,btohqsg
soon to be scrap car loh.,btohqsg
Not the CS3 with fart cans 😹,btohqsg
We all know who’s going to lose if we talk about nuclear warfare,btohqsg
Oh. I thought they naturally like that,btohqsg
Such a rare and nice colour,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  does anyone frequently use cruise control and do you notice a difference in fuel efficiency?,btohqsg
Not often  but when I do the car does consume less fuel for that particular moment in time  but not by much and cruise control in SG is not as useful.,btohqsg

Supposedly does  but SG is city driving start stop alot. So no point. Helpful in msia,btohqsg
only on the expressway and negligible*,btohqsg
Yeah I would think so too! SG doesn't have the highways to use it consistently so wondering if it's even worth the trouble to do so and if there's going to be any difference in our fuel efficiency worth considering,btohqsg
But it is helpful at speed cams locations tho😂😂 i always set cruise when got speedcam,btohqsg
Going for relaxing night drives also good to on cruise control,btohqsg
Lol not everybody drive to speed,btohqsg
Very unlikely that you'll see a major difference unless you do cross country drives (east to west or vice versa) everyday  are not facing traffic and can maintain the set speed,btohqsg
Other than that it's just useful to stay under speed limit if you have LFD (Lead Foot disorder a.k.a. heavy right foot),btohqsg
Booted the fella. No warning needed - J,btohqsg
If he continues to be rude then that account will go too - J,btohqsg

Any1 here drives a forester? How's the FC and maintenance like?,btohqsg
Me . FC 11L/100kmMaintenance like conti car.,btohqsg
hahaha hi five my FC also around 10-11L/100km but i’m a levorg,btohqsg
thank you haha i love foresters too,btohqsg
It’s based on the WRX isn’t it 🤪🤪,btohqsg
haha only shares badge and chassis,btohqsg
Not sure if the SJG and the SK7 suspension is the same 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
anything more then that is a stretch 😛,btohqsg
slow and expensive to maintain species,btohqsg
hahahahaha but subaru is like child,btohqsg
spend a lot of money to fix  damn irritating but u still love it,btohqsg
Cannot all the time… sure pok gai one,btohqsg
im looking at the 2016 forester  urs is when?,btohqsg
Forester XT is good bro. No regret..,btohqsg
Same as wrx engine.. feel the all wheel drive’s g-force.,btohqsg
it’s like how ea888 all got diff variant w differing outputs,btohqsg
that being said forester XT is a great car  though it can be a guzzler depending on how heavy ur foot is,btohqsg
oh cus i was looking at this one Subaru Forester 2.0i-L,btohqsg
this one is barely 150hp i think,btohqsg
Mine say 156… dono really anot,btohqsg
But change one time it last your for 4-5 years,btohqsg
all wheel drive offers you confidence on wet road… 🤣 safety first,btohqsg
Anyway  even Honda vezel also can have many problems  so to me is  it is pretty much depends on how you drive and maintain the car well.,btohqsg
but how much it cost to fix the problem also,btohqsg
vezel cheap  subarus may not be,btohqsg
yeah sadly foresters don’t share same engine as wrx haha,btohqsg
Like hybrid alternator 1K plus also,btohqsg
FA20 the shape not so square right,btohqsg
the shape i not too sure  but the fa20 itself has many diff variations,btohqsg
haha a 300hp forester does sound fun,btohqsg
Only tune down for 20 bhp,btohqsg
Bro  got people running 0-100 less than 6 sec 🤣,btohqsg
I thinking of making mine 200,btohqsg
yeah most engines anywhere in the world got many diff variations la,btohqsg
i also was tempted but i rather preserve the life of the cvt,btohqsg
Your car body weight is just 100 kg lesser than Forrester.,btohqsg
So 1.6 turbo stock is a bit under power,btohqsg
Oh  the na one eh. 2021,btohqsg
Mai leh  haha this one confirm kenna Lim kopi one,btohqsg
Might as well change to xt,btohqsg
That’s I say  those buy Forester na one  will regret awhile later.,btohqsg
like this i also want sti swap my levorg,btohqsg
Go for xt  won’t go wrong,btohqsg
I saw a one photo yesterday  a XV with STI engine …🤣,btohqsg
yall shld share workshop contact also,btohqsg
mighty car mods pulled it off,btohqsg
mod sure make the reliability worst,btohqsg
what you want to mod? Aesthetic or performance?,btohqsg
aesthetics  js buy on rhdjapan or japanparts,btohqsg
Not really eh bro  got turbo must mod Ma. All maker they de-tune their car for your excitement,btohqsg
aiya all the wrx parts can fit into levorg one  it was meant to fitjust that some clown in factory decided that levorg shouldn’t come w sporty version,btohqsg
For instance  A180  A200  BMW 116i  118i.,btohqsg
u see mighty car mods their sti levorg build also seamless,btohqsg
😐 haha i won’t if i had one,btohqsg
A180 stocks 112 bhp  go for stage one become 190 bhp,btohqsg
some cars are meant to stay stock,btohqsg
If you don’t mod mean wasting the car potential one Ma,btohqsg
the car alr handle quite well for wagon i don’t need performance,btohqsg
and not modding save some nagging frm family hahahaha,btohqsg
Just put 6/4 brake kit for safety.,btohqsg
Subaru brake is not so good,btohqsg
LOL bbk don’t make much diff one,btohqsg
2 pot stock no good meh,btohqsg
6/4 on 170hp is overkill haha,btohqsg
Then lower down abit for better handling,btohqsg
pads and lines can alr tbh,btohqsg
car stock alr so low and firm don’t need lol,btohqsg
infront 8 pot behind drum brakes,btohqsg
Actually stock brake is really no good one,btohqsg
SJG .. coilover can fit SK7? I heard,btohqsg
i no chance drive subie man,btohqsg
I mean any car also Ma,btohqsg
tried 992 the brakes stock but not bad,btohqsg
Those say don’t need  because they never try with the good brake kit before like AP etc,btohqsg
stock brakes meant to save lives la,btohqsg
u bbk a cheap family car w 170hp,btohqsg
i see ppl buy bbk end up is gei one leh,btohqsg
i’ve had a cayenne w bbk before,btohqsg
For nice la 😂😂😂 look fast only mah,btohqsg
Ok can you explain your understanding of a bbk,btohqsg
No offence the trade off is many replica one,btohqsg
yeah but i agree though it does look nice haha,btohqsg
but on such a light wagon w not a lot of power it’s really overkill,btohqsg
i rather use the 2k on food or to go holiday,btohqsg
Mine is from the MUSTANG GT500 one,btohqsg
Because bbk's true use is reducing brake fade,btohqsg
some cars really are meant to stay stock,btohqsg
Last car I drove was a GM car,btohqsg
And no one driving in Singapore is getting to that level of braking,btohqsg
Only if you do 99 10+ times in one go,btohqsg
oh i tot is car meant for general manager😅😅,btohqsg
i got soft spot for them,btohqsg
Nice leh . The 1.0 I like,btohqsg
i tell u  drum brakes da best,btohqsg
u dont believe me u ask enzo ferrari,btohqsg
his car all drum brakes last time,btohqsg
can u tell imran not to get a cs3,btohqsg
I bring my bbk go referbish already,btohqsg
all my friends w brembo drive fast cars and i agree with their usage,btohqsg
false i am the poorest by far and wide,btohqsg
Price at that time was too high,btohqsg
Except lack of compression in one cylinder,btohqsg
Last unreg stinger was sold a few weeks ago,btohqsg
That time I go showroom still have,btohqsg
i have heard of that story before,btohqsg
hearsay the owner still using cnc replacement car,btohqsg
I wonder subbie give replacement car is wad 🤣,btohqsg
Cannot judge brands on some units,btohqsg

Cupra engine with fat body 🤪🤪,btohqsg
slower then macan s to 0-100 by 0.1s,btohqsg
golf r in suv skin haha,btohqsg
S3 engine also in that case lolol,btohqsg

I love other cars oso mah,btohqsg

Any one drives the ford focus 1.0 titanium? How’s the maintenance? I read the FC is on the low side due to its weight. Even though it’s a compact car,btohqsg
Have you consider Fit or Jazz?,btohqsg
Seems like a good compact car choice,btohqsg
Haven't seen many focus on the road,btohqsg
Surprisely cost more. I guess due to demand and supply and it’s more popular jap model,btohqsg
But I think down the road it should even out base on maintenance etc,btohqsg
Could be. That’s why trying to find out more from owners.Btw. Nice Audi,btohqsg
Personal (relatives') experience = 👎Numerous issues  oil pump  hoses  worst of which is high oil consumption,btohqsg
Just wondering  the SAF has quite a few of these iirc  how do they maintain it?😂,btohqsg
Theirs are all the older model with 1.6That engine is ok,btohqsg
Constant servicing and indent of parts 😳,btohqsg
Ah I see the 1.6 version... no wonder,btohqsg
It’s FC is higher actually. It’s weight + smaller engine means the engine will strain a bit more to get going. Try looking at the Fiesta Ecoboost,btohqsg
Not sure if it exists here,btohqsg
Imo  small turbo engines esp Conti engines 1.2 and below must be very careful... And absolutely avoid timing belt-in-oil engines like Ecoboost and PureTech if you not inclined to maintain regularly and take careThe only one I think can make it is the 1.0 TSII think Toyota also gave up on the 8NR-FTS (1.2 turbo in the C-HR),btohqsg
this engine is a engineering masterpiece in a sense,btohqsg

What the heck  something wrong with my forester  I got 7km/litre. Max 7.5,btohqsg
Came back recently about 7+ via woodlands  maybe about half hour jam,btohqsg
So let’s say I try to come out by 3-4pm should be ok?,btohqsg
It’s turbocharged 1L tiny thing. It’s small  but produces enough power to pull its weight,btohqsg
yup i think 4pm is a good time,btohqsg
going in i cant say for sure  cos i go at odd hours or at 11am,btohqsg
one is a compact hatch.. the other is normal hatch? haha .. idk.. both also 1.0 ecoboost.  would think the fiesta is lighter  from the pics... hence better FC. compare to the heavier focus..,btohqsg

If you driving car then you just travel on lane 1 then overtake them back to lane 2... usually they are travelling on 80km/h if you really tailgate them to compare the speed... worst is 90km/h plus...,btohqsg
I saw the video also siao sia... drive like Wagan Midnight arcade...,btohqsg
on the road so many in car cams anyway. Besides  nobody asked to be put into such risky situations by these reckless drivers. Imagine an accident.,btohqsg
Tune here tune there then think suddenly they’re such professional race drivers. Go race track and run if they want lor.,btohqsg
I never see leh. Where ah where ah? Step accelerator who don’t know.,btohqsg

But it's recommended for the vans/commercial vehicles to use 3rd lane or in other cases  2nd lane as long as they don't hog the traffic.Source: LTA,btohqsg
But so funny that time got two TP cruising the highway  noone dared to overtake them,btohqsg
So we all bopian follow behind,btohqsg
Hahahaah who are we trying to kid lah…. Wkwkwkwkw,btohqsg
Lol reminds me of getting stuck behind this state trooper...,btohqsg
Then he just stuck his hand out and waved us to pass him,btohqsg

Want to show big ego and seh.. then when caught all pretend  come up with all kinds of lame excuses and run like mice. Haiyahhhhhh,btohqsg
He never see before VTEC open in front of his face mah,btohqsg
Complete disregard for fellow road users. Just because you drive a modded  or expensive  or rare car does not give one the right to put others in danger. It’s just basic respect.,btohqsg
They should rather go in Malaysia and just whack on the highway tgt with the local vehicles... even if they kena accident also better die at there...,btohqsg
Basic respect for local road users still apply imo. Even more so when you’re in other people’s country.,btohqsg
Indeed I have to agree to you...,btohqsg
6km of cycling paths open in the Central Business District 😚Cycling to work has now gotten a lot easier  if you happen to work in the Central Business District that is.The LTA has announced that a total of 6km of cycling paths have now opened within the Central Business District. The new cycling paths come equipped with a total of 4 800 public bicycle parking spaces  so you won’t have to drag your bicycle up with you into the office.👉🏻 Comment and share your opinions (nicely) on creating more cycling paths in Singapore!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
But still they hog the traffic  and the slower cars go and hog the 1st (overtaking) lane.I saw many times when TP go pass them  the heavies then start to switch back to the last/3rd lanes.Which means when most people starts to road hog  the very last lane becomes an overtaking lane...🤷‍♂,btohqsg
I’ve even seen lorries on lane 1 man.,btohqsg
i've seen everything on lane 1,btohqsg
Saw too...i high beam him all the way...mid night some even go racing with you at 120kmh and +,btohqsg
Are you going to laugh at Singapore cost coz you just changed yours across at Malaysia?,btohqsg
Eh Siow one. I got tailgated by lorry before too,btohqsg

Any leaks also can use tape,btohqsg
Tapes and zipties are the way to go,btohqsg
Very rude leh call me stupid,btohqsg

Audi adds extra performance to the RS6 and RS7 🏎💨The Audi RS6 performance and RS7 performance now boast a power increase of 30bhp and 50Nm from their 4.0-litre biturbo V8.👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you love supercars as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg

I remember someone else asking me about the definition recently,btohqsg
what gps app do you all use? been using google maps  but realised that it doesnt know the erp timings when i set ‘avoid toll roads’,btohqsg
But idt waze tells u erp timing too. Iirc only tell u got tolls,btohqsg
Ok... cos there's a story behind me... this why I really hate... anything thanks bro... I just got so worked up by those buggers....,btohqsg
None of the apps work using ERP timing as far as I know,btohqsg
They just tell you there's a toll,btohqsg

rule of thumb morning 7.30 - 9.30 or 10am i think have? at night i not very sure,btohqsg
Nothing warrants such cursing. To err is to be human. When you drive u also make mistakes people curse you to oblivion doesn't feel good right.,btohqsg
I’m not condoning speeding and only behind responsible crazy stunts,btohqsg
But uhh  to each their own and I guess it’s not nice to hear?,btohqsg
Hating them for doing it because of something you’ve experienced is like generalising the car community to be a bunch of hoons who speed and race on the streets of Singapore on a daily basis.,btohqsg
Not saying what they did was right  but 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
But hey  whatever it is your experience was  sorry to hear. Sucks to have experienced the short end of the stick,btohqsg
I thought... you are rickshaw puller?,btohqsg
I have question non car related 😆,btohqsg
Do I need to apply visa for my helper to enter Malaysia? Any one has experience?,btohqsg
Ooooiiiiiiiii not boss not boss 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
rick hownot sure how current this is but:https://www.ivisa.com/malaysia-blog/malaysia-visa-for-myanmar#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20a%20visa you%20need%20a%20Tourist%20eVisa.,btohqsg
Don’t think that mentally works with immigration,btohqsg
They’re part of ASEAN. Should be able to get in visa free,btohqsg
They will just turn you around to go back wkwkwkwkwkwkw,btohqsg
Can just go sentosa after that,btohqsg
Looks like need to apply for visa online even for social visit… haiyah don’t know lah. Best to check embassy website,btohqsg
eVisa cannot be applied in SG though,btohqsg
How has that gotta do with got GF or not? 😵‍💫,btohqsg
If you need a visa to enter Malaysia and are a long term resident or work pass holder in Singapore,btohqsg
