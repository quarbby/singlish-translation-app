I sent food to workers dorm before  that fella put his dorm address and unit number  i also asked for secure zone fee,btohqsg
I sent many times to cgh.. can't go in anyway.. the staff always come drop off lobby to collect,btohqsg
Sometimes I even left the package with security post  take pic n they collect themselves otot,btohqsg
