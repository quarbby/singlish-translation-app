See pricing detail lor if you want to know how it calculated,btohqsg
Very hard to count whether worth it or not,btohqsg
after cny  hard to get more than $15/hr on llm. That's about the minimum rate i get on panda. the $10 base is good but the 35c/km is too low for two way trips.,btohqsg
Actually for 2 way trips  its meant for u to make the 2nd trip back at your convenience  as long as b4 day ends  eg along the way of your other jobs,btohqsg
llm can stack  which helps  but most jobs are food delivery  customer not happy if take too long.,btohqsg
haha ok. if its good i take back my llm $25.,btohqsg
but llm been around a long time  prob got more jobs.,btohqsg

You have to tell them to use the purchasing service. Llm will take 15% as usual.,btohqsg
But if they book trip to trip  then got special req  how like that,btohqsg
How to know if they engage purchasing service,btohqsg
You can say no if you want to. It's a personal favour  bypass llm.,btohqsg
The job will say purchasing service. Before you take can see.,btohqsg
I think Watten estate got one guy always asks to buy cigarettes from shell late atnight. Seen a few times.,btohqsg
Quite a few customers do that  seems like a spreading trend,btohqsg
Must educate customers to book the proper services  they cannot try to cheapskate with this. Even if shop is on the way  it is extra effort to purchase for them. More imptly  many of them need ppl to buy becos they are on SHN. You are taking a greater risk to be anywhere near them,btohqsg
