What do you all think about Allianz growth and income mdis,btohqsg

Anyone received less cashback than they should for DBS livefresh  credited 2 days ago?,btohqsg
Hello! Has anyone applied for the UOB lady’s solitaire using 30k fixed D collateral? Does it mean that the 30k will forever be stuck with UOB under fixed deposits as long as we use the solitaire card?,btohqsg
You have to analyse why you need Lady solitaire? Why other cards cannot meet your spending patterns?,btohqsg
Anyone been to oversea for cosmetic procedures like laser and botox  which miles cards is good?,btohqsg
Depends on how much. Something like crmc + amze or UOB vs.,btohqsg
Used quite a few times today in santiago chile. Amaze classified as debit card and all their terminals want me to enter PIN then can proceed. But in peru  bolivia no need. 🤔,btohqsg
Let us know if you earn 10x because there is dp recently showing 5812 does not earn 10x from CRMC.,btohqsg
i'm new to this channel and don't mind me asking if the Standard Charted Smart Credit Card is offering to change points to miles? also if it's able to do so  why is it not advertised on their webpage?,btohqsg
May I ask what do you folks do to InstaPoints if we don’t need to transfer money overseas? Is there any other way to do redemption besides letting it expire?,btohqsg
How do I qualify for cip terminal service,btohqsg
You can select if you want vouchers  miles  or cashback. Just that with the limited merchants  will take a very long time to get miles,btohqsg
You can read the T&C at ocbc 360 website. They will mention it at spend criteria.,btohqsg
Limited partners for conversion to miles  transfer fee is $27.25/transfer. You only earn bonus points from 11 merchants.,btohqsg
how long will the points expire tho...? 3 years?,btohqsg
yeap the transfer fee i know and im only using krisflyer and it is included in the list as well i believe..??,btohqsg
Realised 90n miles not pool to Rewards’s point,btohqsg

Hey guys  need some advise. Completely new to this. I have no credit card at present. Just moved over to Singapore for a new job. My personal monthly expenses (non - job related) is usually <500 SGD. Usually for other job related expense e.g. travel  etc is I will pay first  company reimburse after. I travel a lot in a year mostly flights expenses and currency conversion fees. I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation credit card of where I should start? Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to confirm that scb supp card details ( card no ) is same as principal card holder is that normal?,btohqsg
Smart credit card to be exact,btohqsg
Your personal expense is offline or online,btohqsg
Fly a lot . Go for citi premier miles .,btohqsg
Relax terry. Dont so fast give suggestion,btohqsg
I think this depends on whether you want to go the miles or cashback route. Since you are doing alot of overseas foreign currency transaction  can consider using the Amaze Card  then linking to:Miles:- Citi Rewards CardCashback:- DCS Platinium Mastercard- CIMB World Mastercard,btohqsg
Also try considering new to bank promos,btohqsg
For hotel . Usually I go for citi premier miles to book at agoda. 6 miles earn. Looking forward now is use amex platinum charge card.  Marriot bonvy hotels,btohqsg
Yup I think he doesn't have any credit cards right now so will qualify for all promos,btohqsg
Nothing special about Amex plat. Cancelled it last week :),btohqsg
Citi premier miles earn miles oversea and not expire.,btohqsg
But the miles earn is so little,btohqsg
I disagree.Restaurants 1 for 1 free.SQ Flight. 200$ credit.Loyal hotel programme.SQ status match with marriot bonvy,btohqsg
Not everything is about hotels only. 2 miles for overseas spend doesn’t really justify the fx spread,btohqsg
https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-ntb-35.htmlHi all! Just saw this savings account ad. Any thoughts?,btohqsg
Dcs exclude amaze transaction  citi reward exclude travel related transaction.,btohqsg
Imo  amex plat charge's the card that if you have to ask if it's worth then it's not for you. Its value heavily depends on ur own lifestyle. personally  it's not for me.,btohqsg
Someone is obsess on that card so introduce that card everytime lol,btohqsg
It’s not a bad card but not worth it to spend on trips to Vietnam only  so hopefully he’s making full use of the card,btohqsg
When u introduce a card u try to consider benefit rewards versus annual fee. Annual fee is upfront while rewards/benefit is highly dependent on lifestyle/spending habit.High tier card with high annual fee is rarely that easy to waive,btohqsg
Yea that’s why I hope he’s not using it on Vietnam trips.,btohqsg
Vietnam should still be more of a cash society rather then cashless?,btohqsg
Not exactly low  he can spend it at luxury store for his gf,btohqsg
