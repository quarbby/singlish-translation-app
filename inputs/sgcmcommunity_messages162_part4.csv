Next time activate the bros and sis atSGCM. I’m sure all more than willing to help one. All the kor kor and jie jie here so nice,btohqsg

Jaguar records its V8 for future generations to listenThe roar of Jaguar's 5.0-litre V8 has been recorded and will be archived at the British Library for future generations to listen.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 React with 😢 for the loss of the V8,btohqsg
How about…they keep making V8s? Simple.,btohqsg
they wont pass EU emission laws,btohqsg
Good idea  gg take over Jaguar and release the XJ220 again - F,btohqsg
End of the day we do all this for the environment it’s just all moot. We’ll find other ways to destroy it. Like mining for batteries LOL,btohqsg
they r aiming to kill off ice cars by 2035,btohqsg
they start by killing high powered cars,btohqsg
i think LTA is aiming for 2030 to stop selling ice cars,btohqsg
and fully electric frm 2040 on,btohqsg
'New registrations of diesel cars and taxis will cease from 2025  and new vehicles registered from 2030 will only be of cleaner-energy models.',btohqsg
think we wont be seeing much ICE cars soon,btohqsg
I think the world needs to stop focusing on EVs and putting more effort into hybrids…,btohqsg
Yah agree  since ev charging takes more efforts and there are many inconsiderate arseholes who unfortunately are rich enough to own an ev.,btohqsg
Inconsiderate people knows no riches  colour or beliefs lah.,btohqsg
u forgot the phv n taxi drivers too,btohqsg
But to be able to buy ev  must be pockets deep ma,btohqsg
And act like they owned them,btohqsg
I think charging etiquette is just something that requires a social movement,btohqsg
Eventually people will come to it.,btohqsg
Ev makes more sense in Malaysia thn in Sg,btohqsg
Or rather anywhere else other thn populated countries like HK n Sg,btohqsg
Plus charging in CBD makes no sense.,btohqsg
Hmm it’s more optimal for city traffic though.,btohqsg
Our problem is largely charging etiquette,btohqsg
Hybrids however is a good inbetween,btohqsg
Oh yes the road hoggers.. unpopular opinion: if someone behind u is faster  just give way,btohqsg
I think hybrid is the way to go. Fuel efficient. And doesnt take forever to charge like EV,btohqsg
Some form of ICE will still be necessary,btohqsg
So the cleanest maybe will be hybrid hydrogen EV,btohqsg
Hydrogen.. the design isn’t optimal. Too huge the tanks. A bit like CNG,btohqsg
Oh i tot someone is developing Hydrogen cars,btohqsg
Not for hydrogen fuel cell at least,btohqsg
I saw the Mirai review by Forrest,btohqsg
3 tanks all made the chassis very squeezy,btohqsg
