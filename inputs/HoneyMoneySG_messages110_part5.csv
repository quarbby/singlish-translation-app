Hi all  just curious is there a legit fee free way to consolidate all payments under 1 single source so only need to setup 1 giro to EGA to earn 1%? One reason I still yet to do any giro for EGA is due to too much hassle to setup giro for multiple cards and bills‚Ä¶ especially card number might chance due to card fraud then need to setup giro again‚Ä¶,btohqsg

I‚Äôm having trouble using Uber in Korea.. it keeps rejecting my Citi credit card  even after enabling it for overseas use. Anyone else had this trouble?,btohqsg
this year if u wan the tax relief when u pay next yearincome tax is paid for income earned FOR previous year  and also relief FOR previous yearso even if u get december's salary in january  or this years bonus in january next year  it will be accounted for in ur income tax since it is paid FOR work done this year,btohqsg
Tax payment for next year will be based on this year. Meaning your self contribution  annual income etc will be based on this year,btohqsg

Can I clarify how many uni$ uob lady card will give you for 2k spending in your selected category? Assuming no promo (just the usual 4mpd),btohqsg
Really? I got only 400 uni$ with a purchase of a Singapore airlines ticket (2k) while travel is my category. This is a purchase about 6 weeks ago. How can I followed up with UOB about this?,btohqsg
Ah lady points will credited in 2 parts. Base points (400pts) when transaction is posted. Bonus points (3.6k pts) will be month end.,btohqsg
The bonus will come following mth. But u say 6 weeks ago mmm. Or did u recently change the category?,btohqsg
Call or do a live chat with them. If you spent in April  bonus would have been credited on 2nd May. Could be the category not captured properly.,btohqsg
No. Just sharing for those who have.,btohqsg
Which website or apps or travel agency you bought the ticket from?The bonus UNI$ shall be credited in first week of May if you bought it in April. You can double check the UNI$ now. It shall appear like ‚ÄúUOB Lady‚Äôs Card UNI$ - Travel‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya I have a feeling the category of that transaction doesn't match lady cat. Only got base pts but no bonus pts.,btohqsg
Is chocolate finance still under MAS,btohqsg
Yup regulated by Mas With DBS as custodian bank of clients‚Äô funds. But they no longer accept account opening.Oversubscribed. But I suspect it‚Äôs also to manage downside risk on their end.,btohqsg
Surprised you found this message because I thought it was deleted üëÄ but yes,btohqsg
Thanks!Just curious is this not supposed to be a public Knowledge? If yes I‚Äôll keep it to myself lol,btohqsg
On the topic of IB  Any idea how to transfer USD out from IB with no cost?,btohqsg

Just want to start using EGA to earn 1% (kinda late to the game as I was too lazy to setup giro since it‚Äôs a manual process and I have multiple bills),btohqsg
Many knew. it's up to the bank to close it. Potentially too many exploit then bank will patch it haha.,btohqsg
Now you knew. Enjoy ur sweet 1% ega.,btohqsg
As I just happen to consider using EGA to pay billsBeen a long time EGA user but only reap benefit from credit card spends  never on bills since giro is troublesomeBut since EGA nerfs on credit card spend I now have to reconsider using it to pay bills,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not really a hack ba  since you still get the same rewards but lesser efforts,btohqsg
