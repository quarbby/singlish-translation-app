For those skeptical of medical Ppe industry growth I will attach some links to industry analyst reports. Industry is projected to grow between 7 to 10 percent annually covid or no covid till 2027.If anyone has reports showing otherwise fell free to post. We all can learn. No opinions please without facts. None of us are experts in Ppe industry.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ww2.frost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PPE-healthcare-infographic.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj04PrI-_TrAhXs6nMBHRTPBbQQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw3BixSXaxne6tPjcDg7LW9Vhttps://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-personal-protective-equipment-market-poised-significant-growthhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/amp/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-market-102015,btohqsg
Forecasted 2024..so won't be anytime soon,btohqsg
Not very optimistic on SIA..Even before covid struck..SIA hardly see any profit growth when compared on a yoy basis..Also the rights issue has diluted the shareholdings by slightly over 2x with a 3 for 2 rights issue..when they finally get profitable  EPS and Dividend ratios would all be more than halved due to this dilution..In other words..They would need to make at least 2x more the net profit..For you to see the same EPS and dividends you use to get..Now..What is the likelihood of this?,btohqsg
