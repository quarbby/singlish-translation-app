It's not like olympiads which is very computational heavy,btohqsg
Did u sit for last year paper?,btohqsg
Rigour? It's not even rigourous when you just give answers and not the full proof,btohqsg
Yeah it's not really that rigorous to be honest,btohqsg
From my experience with A levels and SMO  I think A levels can be more rigourous in certain aspects  as in proving things for some general case,btohqsg
SMO questions u dont need working  so you can use unconventional methods  like drawing the thing to scale,btohqsg
I mean I suck so I cant go for paper 2,btohqsg
No. That means SMO is nonsense,btohqsg
But SMO they dont really teach u problem solving they teach u tricks,btohqsg
Exactly. So why bother and claim you suck when you are comparing yourself to some nonsense?,btohqsg
I mean I suck at the paper,btohqsg
Some teachers at school have this false illusion that mathematics olympiads really test your skills,btohqsg
That's what I'm trying to say,btohqsg
Well  if you like then you do it  don't really see a concrete reason to downplay olympiad.I honestly don't get the purpose of this argument.,btohqsg
It doesn't test math as per se  but more like logic,btohqsg
As someone who does both Olympiad Math and higher-level math  I think they somewhat complement each other,btohqsg
For SMO R1  yeah most of the time its tricks that'll get you the answer and you're at a disadvantage if you try to do every question legit,btohqsg
thats just a consequence of R1 format,btohqsg
But R2 questions and IMO shortlist questions and whatnot generally require more than just tricks to do.,btohqsg
Thats my take on it at least,btohqsg
"Hotels are now offering work-from-hotel packages which allow you to work and hopefully enjoy a mini staycaytion on the side.We tried one of these ""workation"" experiences at lyf Funan and here's what we think of it.➡️https://bit.ly/3i9vel2Work-from-home or Work-from-hotel?",btohqsg
my father's boss paid for the hotel stay for all workers from malaysia lol,btohqsg
Us Trade war w china and Covid19 affecting economy everywhere,btohqsg
Can i go JC if I'm taking combined science and no Additional math,btohqsg
Huh but i thought is very hard,btohqsg
Yep  I have a friend with combine science but no A math  also went to JC,btohqsg
Took H2 sciences but H1 math,btohqsg
I doubt you’ll be allowed to take H2 maths however,btohqsg
my friend is in a jc  w no amath and took comb sci,btohqsg
Entry to JC is based only on your L1R5  not your subjects,btohqsg
yes it is hard  but not impossible,btohqsg
Some school allow if u take some selection test,btohqsg
if u wna take h2 math i believe there is briding aft a selection test or smth like that,btohqsg
My Recommendation is don't take H2 math hahah,btohqsg
But the gap from Emath to H2 math is too big,btohqsg
Yes i was told this too,btohqsg
my friend took h2 math w no amath,btohqsg
Unless u study A math during ur holiday,btohqsg
shes not doing v well w math,btohqsg
u have to rly be invested in practising,btohqsg
H2 Mathematics is not that hard  I always try to look up to people. I try not to judge someone by their background,btohqsg
It is leh  I'm still struggling hahaha,btohqsg
And I took amath and emath,btohqsg
Many people learn it the wrong way that's why,btohqsg
I trust that you will do well,btohqsg
You are a genius. You can do it!How? Don't rely so much on the JC notes and graphing calculator. Rely on definitions and theorems,btohqsg
I'm not a senpai. I'm stupid and worthless,btohqsg
Jeanbut speaking from personal experience. Even for students with A1 emath and amath can get U grade for H2 math,btohqsg
If a stupid and worthless person can do it  why can't a genius do it?,btohqsg
if you still die die cannot just rote learn ezpz,btohqsg
