The stability is still the best thing,btohqsg
I disagree  I think it's the right motivation,btohqsg
I also am keen on teaching ngl,btohqsg
On the other hand I find this motivation very unstable if untested.,btohqsg
Cos is stable  and i enjoy the process also,btohqsg
Stability and $ come hand in hand,btohqsg
Ever wondered why 5000 moe teachers quit every 5 years?,btohqsg
Find it fun to see student's reactions to weird qns,btohqsg
Ye they can hit 5 digits per month full time tuition,btohqsg
Telling people (x+y)^2 != x^2+y^2 except for fields of characteristic 2,btohqsg
But i just like the eureka feels,btohqsg
If you like academics  you should not be a teacher,btohqsg
And how u can influence their choices,btohqsg
It's called Freshman's dream so it is expected to occur even for undergrad,btohqsg
Get ur phd and become a prof,btohqsg
Because there’s no more challenging material in it for you,btohqsg
Teachers that go into the profession for this reason is !@#¥,btohqsg
I like to hear myself talk  is another reason why I’d like to teach,btohqsg
Thats why i still enjoy 'non-official teachin' aft 2 yrs,btohqsg
I wonder if u can sustain that for 20-30 years,btohqsg
You are the opposite of me,btohqsg
Prof not for everyone. You need to enter top US uni to prof in SG.Prof in nowhere-land  dunno  see luck still tho.,btohqsg
The see-luck-part especially applies for Tenure,btohqsg
His children must like him then,btohqsg
If not for the fact that you’re 1 year too old and that we never met  I’d have thought you’re Gareth.,btohqsg
LOL teachers that go into teaching for 'noble reasons' generally don't last long,btohqsg
Simply put 'noble' people die very fast,btohqsg
Worked with teachers who stayed all the way for 'noble' reasons staying put,btohqsg
Cos they are against private tuition,btohqsg
Ok I see what u mean,btohqsg
But ofc most leave i guess for private,btohqsg
yeah but met tons of them throughout sch tho,btohqsg
“I like to hear myself talk” is so Gareth. And I literally heard him say that before.,btohqsg
Prof from NIE  professor in research or professor in teaching?,btohqsg
I can hear him say that,btohqsg
I wanna be a prof too,btohqsg
teaching and research at the same time,btohqsg
yea AU is next to impossible,btohqsg
When my teaching supervisor talks about tuition to me she always made a disgust face,btohqsg
WtfMine recommends me to open one,btohqsg
idk I'm planning to get a pharmD,btohqsg
Just wait for them to reject you,btohqsg
Or accept if you are really good,btohqsg
but then being a pharmD in sg is crazily difficult,btohqsg
PharmD can do more than just prof,btohqsg
Ye true  but to some extent pay is also a motivating reason to such extent,btohqsg
I legit dk what a pharmD does other than academia,btohqsg
Shall cya become a prof next time,btohqsg
if I'm smart enough  that is,btohqsg
His day job is in BigPharma  so there's that lol,btohqsg
