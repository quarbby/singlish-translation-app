mine is byproduct of doing cash management so no extra effort.so far hsbc quite accurate and honourable.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  may I know is it possible for a retirees who has fund in the bank but  no income to apply a credit card?,btohqsg
Need to put fixed deposit in the bank. Which card are you interested?,btohqsg
Just any basic card will do  mainly for groceries and dining  thanks.,btohqsg
I found the Best Credit Card for Beginners: Mari Credit Cardhttps://youtu.be/jlWcWHOl5bU,btohqsg
For UOB Paynow SALA from personal bank accounts trick will no longer work? This is the T&C,btohqsg
Its promotion. Self credit doesnt work for promotion.,btohqsg
This is not UOB One account t&c.,btohqsg
Not sure if this is shared. GXS 4.3% will have a confirmation email if you onboard.,btohqsg
do you have the link i can‚Äôt seem to find this page,btohqsg
No point finding the link anymore. The last day to onboard was ytd,btohqsg
This is an email I just received. As for how I sign up  I forgotten already. Probably log in GXS and create boast account and put money in,btohqsg
eveyrone got it already ? asking cos I don't seem to have it,btohqsg
Possibly it is Bonus interest for the saving ?,btohqsg
2 misconceptions i just read:1. UOB salary promo criteria is not the same as UOB One bonus interest criteria.2. the HSBC bonus interest credited today is not the HSBC 1% GIRO benefit,btohqsg
Yes. Seems like all my friends got it liao.,btohqsg
weird.. I found it in Sep last month for July. means I got it a mth earlier?,btohqsg
those looking to sign up for this - beware if your voucher usage triggers their apparently ‚Äúvery sensitive‚Äù security system  your shopee account will be permanently banned and all ur 5% cashback awarded in shopee coins are basically forfeited :),btohqsg
Could your promo be for Jun/July?And ours for July/Aug?,btohqsg
For SCB giro it seems even if you have a refund into the account way before due date   the giro still deduct full amount of statement date due  anyone has similar experience?,btohqsg
Hi all  I applied for AMEX TC via singsaver here.. was supposed to have the $150 cash paynow. I emailed singsaver 3 times follow up no response.. what should I do?,btohqsg
Giro deductions are automated. The amount for the Giro month is predetermined and submitted for processing days before deduction date. I experienced before  which is why i don't pay card bills by giro. U can try ask bank to credit u back the excess amount paid to your bank account with them,btohqsg
For other banks  any credits in time will be offset  thus thinking if SCB is different,btohqsg
Citibank is like scb as well. They will deduct whole amt on statement even if prepaid some before due date,btohqsg
anyone have any good ideas how to use $700 on 5812 or 5814 stored value.. like starbucks this type (but i don't want $700 into starbucks!!)thanks!,btohqsg
Unless u keep helping colleague to tabao their starbuck or to pay first for company event but to be honest 700 on dining at one merchant is very hard to ultilise,btohqsg
if only breadtalk card is 5812 or 5814 i can finish $700 in 2-3 months..but it is grocery sigh..you know any other dining stored value cards?,btohqsg
suggestions so far:1. starbucks2. xiangxiang hunan,btohqsg
Why u have to die die buy 700 lol,btohqsg
trust cashback 15%! this is my 3rd month,btohqsg
Xiangxiang hunan is bomb  highly recommend,btohqsg
This is consider force spending in my opinion loh haha,btohqsg
if buy stored value still ok i guess.. but must be on stores that i will usually go (so not really forced but pay it forward),btohqsg
forced spending is like those credit card vouchers.. give you $100 vouchers at restaurants that u usually don't go.. and you force yourself to go and eat there just to use the voucher (and pay more than the voucher value),btohqsg
Then u list down store that u really do loh. To be honest i think effective rate of trust cashback is not that high as calculated by fintech youtuber. I am a fan if maybank fnf even more since it include 5814 now,btohqsg
4.9% blended loh... it is good because i use the 1% to pay health hub,btohqsg
Healthhub can get better cashback using other better card haha,btohqsg
Hi thanks.Just this 2 banks from knowledge?,btohqsg
i don't have those cards.. and not enough.. i only CRMC $1k only,btohqsg
If i did not rmb wrong i think it is less than 4.9 percent based on others calculation due to the cap cashback on the 15 percent reward,btohqsg
$1667 x 15% = $250.05$4333 x 1% = $43.33Total = 293.38 / 6000 = 4.89%,btohqsg
i am extremely worried about this.. for people like us who play musical chairs.. will kenna money held for 24 hours or notSINGAPORE ‚Äì Banks must block or hold for 24 hours suspicious transactions involving more than $25 000.This move must be part of banks‚Äô real-time fraud surveillance to substantially reduce cases of customers having large sums of money rapidly drained from their accounts without their knowledge  the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Oct 24.An account is considered to be rapidly drained if more than half of a balance of at least $50 000 is transferred out cumulatively over a day.,btohqsg
Forgot to include other spend cashback. But u can always apply for other card that suit your spending habit better,btohqsg
Wow jia lat  should we do citi payall below 25k üò±,btohqsg
better NOT be JUST IN TIME WARRIOR liao...,btohqsg
what do u mean other spend cashback?,btohqsg
Seems like questions will be asked.,btohqsg
