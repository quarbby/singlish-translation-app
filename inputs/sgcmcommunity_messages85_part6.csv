As with many owners globally… to FLEX!!!!! Wahahahhah,btohqsg
Maybe one day I can afford fd2r!!!,btohqsg
I think you just left an incomplete sentence sir ..,btohqsg
To give family man performance car,btohqsg
but got nice car like those meh,btohqsg
I somehow think is like this   plaid 1000 horse   Taycan turbo s 700 horse all are family man sedan !,btohqsg
Can bring me go one day sir?,btohqsg
I apply leave with my boss,btohqsg
Actually I think plaid is around 400 plus k when land in sg,btohqsg
He don’t like car one. Only like count money,btohqsg
I pay him the loss when you take leave,btohqsg
What is money when you own a Plaid,btohqsg
Can I take leave  and you pay ME?,btohqsg
400 plus k car is like a 740 ma,btohqsg
But 740 and s400 road tax so little in comparison,btohqsg
Roadtax every year fork out money somemore,btohqsg
And quality of interior probably better,btohqsg
In terms of materials and comfort,btohqsg
I see omv is 150 k ba,btohqsg
Yes but Braun’s road tax5000-6000ma half of it only,btohqsg
Huat huat here need pay almost 4x the price,btohqsg
People in the north American and middle eastern markets still waiting for theirs after 12 to 16 months also,btohqsg
Taycan turbo s can get within 6 months max if order today,btohqsg
Might be a second slower off the line but better driving experience for sure,btohqsg
Anyway driving experience isn’t only about brochure numbers or who reach what speed first imho,btohqsg

Whatever makes one happy y’all!! your ride your vibe. Just enjoy your car whatever you have. Owning ANY car in Singapore is already an achievement!,btohqsg
Singapore Taycan need 18 month wait,btohqsg
Seems that dealer don’t want to sel,btohqsg
6 months only from what I heard and enquired,btohqsg
Unless you indent a few things  then 8 to 10 because of wire harness issues,btohqsg
Is it I got a friend just bought 18 month wait,btohqsg
Actually is slower by a lot easily 4 car length but does not matter,btohqsg
But for me tesla servicing and price is just too good   let said model s came sg at 400 k that is suppose so   so much cheaper then Taycan,btohqsg
I had contacted tesla to change aircon filter   only $74 and they come down to my place and do the job,btohqsg
In terms of numbers 1 second off for 0-100 but obviously the Tesla hot 1000hp also,btohqsg
So it'll pull a bit more in the mid range as well,btohqsg
Does not matter really both Taycan and plaid are overpower,btohqsg
But taycan got 2 speed gearbox,btohqsg
So it helps a bit to cope in the mid and top end,btohqsg
But then again they're heavy too,btohqsg
Ya even mine I feel too powerful,btohqsg
When I over take ppl u can see they sometime will pull Thier car back to Thier lane,btohqsg
Depends on weather and food that day,btohqsg
Actually is quite dangerous to overtake motor,btohqsg
No sound then they think they are fast,btohqsg
Can see most of the time they are shock when they are been overtake,btohqsg
Have to be considerate to other road users,btohqsg
Anyone went to Singapore Expo Modified car show? Hall 6A,btohqsg
at KL maybe i will go,btohqsg
