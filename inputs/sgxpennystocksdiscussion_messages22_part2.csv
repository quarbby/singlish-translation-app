MT - beware !! touched 99.5 never strong rebound,btohqsg
maybe because STA is priced correctly?and also whenever STA have a price run... the SET will come out to investigate again so it never had a chance to record those x10 price,btohqsg

Ya. Nothing is confirm. But so many of us here is trying to make MT & VP stay up yet it keeps going down  obviously stronger parties out there force it down.,btohqsg

Tg only safe if tan sri come out again,btohqsg

If BBs make it drop to 2.4 or less after the report was already out last week  I believe the shares will be gobbled by investors & TG bosses,btohqsg
If bb can make mt goes to 1  tg also same i think... they ady distributing at high side  watching retailer kill each other,btohqsg

but your 96 cents call still good?,btohqsg
There was a time when 118 was a strong support,btohqsg
agree.. the chart for mt stinks. i know its a hindsight thing but way before i didnt like the slow distribution. Rebound after 3 days down again  it didnt manage to stay still. like the previous pattern before results,btohqsg
i belive this week medtecs should have a big rally from oversold postion,btohqsg
