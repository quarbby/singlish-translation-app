Hi guys Im going to test drive at a couple of dealerships next week. Im going with my cousin as this is my first time looking at cars irl. Can anyone share any insights on what wil happen,btohqsg
They will pressure you and say better sign up now because next bid sure go up. Better take some time and think through probably and not buy a particular car because of extra 1-2k voucher.,btohqsg
I see. How long will the test drive be,btohqsg
you dont have to worry about this. you will be strictly guided on the test drive just ask them,btohqsg
please spend your time thinking about things that actually matter like how much you are willing to spend  what you want exactly in a car. so you dont get duped into a sale you didnt actually want,btohqsg
That pretty much sums up what's gonna happen lol,btohqsg
Yah  and remember they dun put such breakdown that you need to pay one:1. Down-payment2. Insurance3. Road tax4. 1st instalment5. Licence plate (I think $100?),btohqsg
So you really gotta do the maths  if need to squeeze  then go for other brand or model,btohqsg
I think it depends on whether the showroom is crowded,btohqsg
Hahahaha won't buy used one given the hype 😂,btohqsg
Insurance make sure free towing  loss of use/replacement car. I kena scam by my dealer  never fight for these stuff for me so quite sian when accident,btohqsg

Not buying la haha just viewing,btohqsg
Take pics (of the girls and the price breakdown) 🤣,btohqsg
I more interested in the price of the cars though 😂,btohqsg
If you didn't take full loan  you can consider especially if coe drop further,btohqsg
Eh? Your car not many years left rite? Is it 3 or 2?,btohqsg

This one need pay  just choose the insurance company that covers this.,btohqsg
