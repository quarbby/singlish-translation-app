Is he the guy from tikok,btohqsg
initially it was take home 2.8k then after i passed my qualifying exam (1.5 years into my phd) it goes up to 3.5k. then now moe increase all these things so it's 4k,btohqsg
i remember he made a very good video about how to learn  but i saved it and never looked at it again lmao,btohqsg
For some reason I can't help but at first think abt like the Chris Chan shit,btohqsg
the phd students i currently work w rn are all being paid arnd 4k+,btohqsg
uhh unpaid they don't care  but paid stuff if it's within NTU usually just write in they ok,btohqsg
yea that's about the standard rn,btohqsg
the paid peer teaching like pretty easy to bypass,btohqsg
oh yea how was complex midterm,btohqsg
like if the undergraduate is friends with someone  they can just fill in their name for their teaching slots and get the money lmao,btohqsg
3 questions  i didnt know how to do all 3,btohqsg
but its because im pretty dumb,btohqsg
nope  written on the paper itself,btohqsg
tbh that was my year experience also,btohqsg
nah this CSA is literally so bad,btohqsg
he interrupted the exam 6 times to correct his errors on the paper,btohqsg
lowest in the cohort was 1/30 in my year,btohqsg
and the last time he interrupted the paper he actually missed out an important info crucial to understand/answer the question for one of the question,btohqsg
oh it was out of 30 for your year,btohqsg
im just glad i got through this week,btohqsg
qm1 mid terms  ps2 mid terms  complex mid terms  lab report and viva all on the same week is no go,btohqsg
i mean he's been a legend even before i was in this gc,btohqsg
idk what he stirred in this gc,btohqsg
but the fact that ntu has a thread on him,btohqsg
then ntu orientation he kept asking if he could take final year mods as a y1,btohqsg
ik bc heâ€™s my junior in ntu lol,btohqsg
and worked with some of my friends,btohqsg
oh yea then last time IAPS (international association of physics students) didnâ€™t have an sg branch so he joined their AGM as an individual candidate and apparently was a meme there too,btohqsg
at least now we have a branch,btohqsg
i think it got recommended ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
the other chan ric stuff need to ask the super super laojiao,btohqsg
oh yea he said this but iirc he didnâ€™t do super well for his y1 mods,btohqsg
and during y1 lab he had some issues working with lab partners from poly lol,btohqsg
rn he has a second upper gpa,btohqsg
i hope i enter pass/fail course,btohqsg
i love my 11 years of suffering!,btohqsg
iâ€™m in my 6th year of suffering,btohqsg
hair line hasnâ€™t completely receded yet,btohqsg
ok 4 years not too bad but the 2 years after â€¦,btohqsg
i thought phd is 5 years,btohqsg
or does this vary from field to field,btohqsg
varies from field to field  uni to uni  country to country,btohqsg
in sg itâ€™s p fixed at 4 bc its q structured,btohqsg
in the US itâ€™s like 2 years of classes then you do research for another 2 min but ik some people have taken 8 years,btohqsg
1 of my friend is in 3rd yr,btohqsg
itâ€™s the worst there lol even tho a lot of great research facilities are there,btohqsg
another is having her phd defense prob in may,btohqsg
time flies when ur doing nothing,btohqsg
