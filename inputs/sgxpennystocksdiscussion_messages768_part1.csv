🎉Pika World Daily Review – 3 March 2023🎉💎Against all odds towards a green closing🗽Equity markets shed off the burden of a rising yield and pare all losses decisively towards the closing  potentially averting a breakdown of an uptrend. It was a night of turbulence. First  we saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise above 4%. Then  the 2-year treasury yield rose sharply to 4.9%  a 52-week high.Without a doubt  the latest US jobless claim stood at 190K  which is still a resilient labour market. For the past few weeks  the firmer economic data with hawkish commentary from many Fed officials had dampened sentiment of any pivot or slowing of the interest rate hike. Now  market participants are pricing in a 26.2% chance that the Fed will boost the rate hike by 50 basis points during the March meeting.💰One comment  One boost- MVP goes to Bostic🗽Federal Reserve President Bostic believed a cautious stance was appropriate given the current restrictive monetary policy. Therefore  he supports a 0.25% hike which appeared to relieve the market. With that  the market breathed a sense of life  and we saw equity markets return to a solid footing.Nonetheless  we remain cautious of further headwinds as we welcome more critical data today.📮What are our dishes today?📖At 10.45 pm  we will have the S&P 500 Composite PMI for February  which is expected to climb to 50.5 from a contraction of 46.8.Next  at 11 pm comes many strings of data. The most important will be the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI data which is expected to moderate slightly to 54.5 from 55.2.FOMC Member Bostic is expected to speak at 12.45 am. So it might be yet another market mover again.It is 3 March  Friday  8.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. We have arrived at the final trading day of the week. So let’s hope for another green shoot and catch up tonight on the latest economic data release analysis.From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg
