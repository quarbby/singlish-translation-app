Try OCBC's website instead. Use PayNow transfer  Salary Payment with remarks of PAYNOW SALA.Check after 2 working days. If cannot the only way left is probably via DBS.,btohqsg
1.6 to 1.9k still contemplating which exact model to get,btohqsg
Thanks.  Look forward to hear from others,btohqsg
Does the uob miles earning look at posted date or transaction date? It's been more than a week and close to next month but my transaction is still not posted yet. =(,btohqsg
