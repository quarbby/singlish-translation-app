do we choose the area we want during the application as well?,btohqsg
I think what I understood so far actually Punggol Sengkang same when it comes to resale price .Even Punggol and Sengkang resale price is same like Sembawang now.,btohqsg
Also it‚Äôs coz Punggol and Sengkang have more flats to offer for resale in comparison of other estates so people have more options to buy there and I think later tengah will have same resale median,btohqsg
Hi... anyone knows when the sale of balance flats will be launched?,btohqsg
Can check HDB esale website to check the transaction price  dont need to guess.,btohqsg
Punggol central 4 room fetch $423k only base in HDB record.üòÄ,btohqsg
Yes sale price depend on location  which floor and how many lease years remaining.,btohqsg
my mum's 4r in punggol 2nd and 3rd storey worth 370k,btohqsg
Do u guys know Normally when Hdb started to access our grant most probably the result will be out very soon,btohqsg
Hey. Wondering if anyone know when hdb will inform you when you can collect your bto key? Will it be few mths or few weeks before key collection?,btohqsg
I was told 2 months before key collection so that we have enough time to re evaluate our housing loan when I signed lease if I didn‚Äôt remember wrongly ü§î,btohqsg
3 mths b4 key collection u need submit hle,btohqsg
Yes correct it depends on which room model are fetching 500k coz normal 4Rm is the same everywhere unless best view or high floor,btohqsg
Not accurate. Just an automatic formula tracker based timeline.,btohqsg
