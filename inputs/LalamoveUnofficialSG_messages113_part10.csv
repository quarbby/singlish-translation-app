But again this is my own thinking lah😂,btohqsg
Sometimes I look at the missions  I just get the feeling llm just wants to seduce drivers to do any job regardless of price etc so as to show their customers that our platform is good. Any job also have drivers fast fast take  so that clients will keep using llm,btohqsg
Especially on wkends I think there r more part timers doing  so when they accept mission they will just take any job that comes. Again all this is my own thoughts  apologies if offend anyone or is incorrect.,btohqsg

So if speak to CS = valid cancellation = no penalty,btohqsg
the word valid is not defined by us  is LLM. Cos someone here says b4  even his car breaks down the next day he also got a suspension. SO valid or not. who knows. confirm we dun know. All this platform full of driver  less 1 no difference to them,btohqsg
Sounds like we are inside Squid Game ah… 😅,btohqsg
This afternoon I went to remove the lalamove stickers from my honda fitDrove and parked at the shopfront at ubi techpark  went inside to inform that I want go remove the stickers and was assisted while ask to take a seat while someone will be here to assist to remove the stickers. I was taking a seat at the lobby facing the front desk.Within minutes  a male staff walk out of the office and went to my car to remove the stickers immediately without informing me at all. I was lucky that I just happen to turn my head to look at my car and saw first piece of the lalamove sticker is removed accordingly,btohqsg
I went towards him and watch him continuously removing the lalamove stickers. The left side of the car door at the front  paintwork fell off and he immediately signalled me of the damage as I was watching closely.Next  was the left door at the back. He blocked my view and just remove the stickers  however I notice the paint work fell off too and told him that to which he nodded and inform he will take pictures of the damage and tell me to drive to the designated car workshop nearby and they will arrange to get it fix,btohqsg
Any1 can anyhow just remove the stickers 1 ah? No need go workshop to remove 1 meh? Sorry hor cos I dunno all these things 1,btohqsg
Lalamove sent me msg and ask me to proceed to the car workshop given in the WhatsApp and so I did,btohqsg
Ask me to look for a lady called siew mui who is the lady boss of the car workshop.,btohqsg
These are the after removal look from lalamove. They only mention to fix the damage paintwork but never say the adhensive part u guys saw they will take care of it as well,btohqsg
The adhesive part is the line?,btohqsg
Lalamove staff is trained workshop pple meh😂😱🤷‍♂,btohqsg
I parked outside their office and they remove the stickers on the spot,btohqsg
This is why I keep procrastinating over whether to put sticker. And mine new car 1 yr odd old only,btohqsg
Think they don't give a damn abt our cars,btohqsg
The workshop quoted $240 for the repair of paint work. The same lalamove staff who removed the stickers called me and said I signed the contract during the installation of the stickers and in the clause it stated that the maximum damage amount they are willing to compensate is $207,btohqsg
The rest of the outstanding I have to pay myself,btohqsg
It's ok bro. But thanks for the offer. Appreciate it🙏,btohqsg
Luckily my car is a coe car  remaining 1 year plus to scrap so i didnt proceed with the repair,btohqsg
Earlier  the workshop lady boss called lalamove to confirm the damage cost to be bill to them. They didn't pick up. I called them and they send me msg,btohqsg
The purpose of me sharing is based on my personal experience with lalamove and I hope my sharing can help people to take reference and consider more before installation and during removal of the stickers,btohqsg
Ok bro.  Thanks for the advice. Anyway I'm going to stick other company sticker soon. Till then I will remember your tips😊👍🙏,btohqsg
I make sure I stand there watch them do,btohqsg
Dun care they uncomfortable or not,btohqsg
Thanks alot for sharing. Helped me make my decision of not sticking the sticker concrete😂😂,btohqsg
The workshop maybe is owned by llm 😂😂,btohqsg
Dun think so  as the lady boss told me there were 3 vehicles before who came to her workshop and none were confirm job for her to do and she thought mine is her first deal. Sadly no also😂,btohqsg
Think she will have difficulty getting the payment from llm also😂😂,btohqsg
Maybe need to wait for every Wed then can get the payment😂,btohqsg
Dun think even got business from llm.. who will pay for the damage? 😂. They stick their advertisement on your car and when removed and caused damages to the paintwork  you still need to top up extra if too expensive. Wtf. lol.,btohqsg
Btw Ive withdraw all the credits from llm today,btohqsg
Llm like to push responsibilities away,btohqsg
