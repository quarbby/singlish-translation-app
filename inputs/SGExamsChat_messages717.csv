Actually speaking of health problems  i hate ppl who say that ‘u are pushing urself too hard’  ‘take a break’ and blah blah without actually knowing what u are going through,btohqsg
My health(???) problemsTired in middle of dayRandom stomach acheRandom nauseaRandom dizzyness,btohqsg
Eh help this is almost me,btohqsg
I hv all of these except the dizziness,btohqsg
But my nausea and get really bad,btohqsg
i mean true but at the same time when you take a step back you realise your time isn’t being spent optimally anyway lol,btohqsg
While ppl around me are doing work in the morning,btohqsg
Yea but it is also hard to take a break when u know exams are coming up,btohqsg
i think its unproductive for me personally,btohqsg
Then pushing through a little by a little is kinda better than doing nothing,btohqsg
Tbh i find there no purpose in last min studying before the eoys (looking through is ok but learning new stuff is 😬😬),btohqsg
Id rather just listen to a twice song and chill,btohqsg
idk my take has always been finding my groove to get things done instead of feeling like it’s do or die,btohqsg
I think dun pressurize urself by others  in jc  i study mostly at home lol,btohqsg
if i’m gonna drag my ass through finishing finals and it’s gonna be slow anyway,btohqsg
nah idrc what others are doing tbh,btohqsg
i might as well make it less painful,btohqsg
The two ppl next to me are studying and im using telegram,btohqsg
In jc i just shut 2 ears,btohqsg
i should be sleeping on the train,btohqsg
They can say whatever they want,btohqsg
Coz my class hv 3 toxic toxic people,btohqsg
The boy not in class yet... Is he dead 😔 or just a ckw 🤓,btohqsg
Ok he just arrived  so hes not dead ( i think),btohqsg
anyway for studying just do what works for you la,btohqsg
issue is recognising for works for you lol,btohqsg
The 5 boys in my class can be summarised as follows1. Model student type2. guy who retained y43. 🤡4. 🤡 best friend5. Jae,btohqsg
damn i wouldn’t fit in any of those,btohqsg
Let me think of sth to describe my class guys,btohqsg
Actually it is good to be a model student coz i got a scholarship even tho i screwd up my interview coz i think my cher close 2 eyes,btohqsg
Strangely the guys in my class is v quiet,btohqsg
except tht i didn't get mye till sec 4,btohqsg
The 7 guys in my class1) gamer  😡 and weird2) my competitor but actually also not3) gamer4 & 5) innocent6) sleeping beauty7) clown,btohqsg
Actually how long is yt muted for? It seems like forever,btohqsg
I started investing on webull and my portfolio is down rip,btohqsg
i think you’re overestimating how much you screwed up then,btohqsg
one guy is just jae 💀,btohqsg
and he likes + take chinese lit also,btohqsg
Bruh the east west line a few stations sunlight  a few stations underground 💀,btohqsg
Pain in the eyes to sleep,btohqsg
Oh another pain in the ass line,btohqsg
way easier to get seats at paya tho,btohqsg
i want to sleep in cce,btohqsg
Yea indeed but damn the seats are ded af,btohqsg
with how tired i am i would’ve slept on a bed of damn needles,btohqsg
True  normally I'll just stand the whole way  and close my eyes,btohqsg
Mine is daily paya to caldecott,btohqsg
Low-key i was half asleep this morning to work,btohqsg
Please save me I need take 3 buses to work😭,btohqsg
4 premolars removed and 4 wisdom teeth (which are still INSIDE the gums) removed for braces,btohqsg
and my dentist is telling me tht im missing a few molar's,btohqsg
i have my braces for almost 4 yrs alr💀,btohqsg
I was bleeding everywhere on the bed on the bedsheets etc,btohqsg
wisdom teeth tend to grow weirdly,btohqsg
ahhh I hope I recover asap,btohqsg
that’s why a lot of people get them removed eventually when they start being a pain,btohqsg
i have a missing tooth. now we r waiting for the gap to close thn can remove liao,btohqsg
i heard wisdom is oni for smart ppl. sounds fake ngl,btohqsg
Meanwhile I have a teeth decayed so badly  overcrowding is not a issue,btohqsg
if it doesn’t grow properly it’s gonna be easy to get cavities,btohqsg
The teeth beside it being forced on by the wisdom tooth is like rainforest trees fighting for sunlight,btohqsg
That teeth is edging ever closer to the placement of the decayed tooth,btohqsg
our mouths have evolved to be smaller and smaller,btohqsg
so a lot of people don’t have room for the third set of molars,btohqsg
That decayed tooth looks like the flying Dutchman treasure cove,btohqsg
i thankfully never had to get them extracted,btohqsg
my dentist was like they’re growing perfectly,btohqsg
no NS MC for it tho,btohqsg
When I went for my medical checkup the dentist at the dental station was like  I have 2 badly decayed tooth,btohqsg
One can still be saved  the other has to be root canal,btohqsg
but the cher (it was mr gohell lol) told me 'andrea  you looked really nervous',btohqsg
i need to stop professional procrastination...im getting paranoid coz my interview is like i keep stumbling even now,btohqsg
i mean it’s like what i told you. being nervous isn’t an issue on its own if you could answer stuff,btohqsg
Hi guysss I just receive SMU interview are there any tips or like many questions the profs will ask,btohqsg
Helloodoes NTU’s application end at 23 59?,btohqsg
unless otherwise stated yea but don’t wait till then lol,btohqsg
You also need to pay before then,btohqsg
yes so u must apply at 2358 on the dot,btohqsg
so if u get it its a sign from God,btohqsg
if not its not meant to be,btohqsg
That’s only for submission of certain documents,btohqsg
my principal actually lives my area,btohqsg
bruh tdy i literally saw him in the bus on the way to the mrt,btohqsg
or maybe now rly muted forever,btohqsg
Last time I saw my pri school VP near my grandparents house,btohqsg
I was walking home with parents and saw this women  I thought why her hair so familiar,btohqsg
Then when she turned...oh now  I know why,btohqsg
Pritam singh lives behind my house,btohqsg
Maybe can become friends w him then he can fetch u to school,btohqsg
Imagine going to buy food and you see him drinking kopi,btohqsg
there's a girl who lives near me in the same area who also goes tmjc,btohqsg
and my next period is pe,btohqsg
Me too but i never interacted w her,btohqsg
I've had friends say leg pain and sit out,btohqsg
"other than ""thanks for waking me up"" in the bus",btohqsg
Bruh that's the start of Wattpad stories,btohqsg
Haha just pulling your leg ah  up to you lorh,btohqsg
Speaking of which there was once i missed the sch stop coz my bag got trapped in the seat and then i rang the bell again but the driver drove off…so i walked back fr the next bus stop (luckily it was one of those rare days where i was actually quite early),btohqsg
"i was thinking of once i randomly go up to her and ask ""so why did u choose tmjc""",btohqsg
@habibi5201should I sit out of pe,btohqsg
Oh my god the straps stuck on the seats,btohqsg
That shit is like panick 1000,btohqsg
in pri sch this happened to me except it was a school bus,btohqsg
Ya what if cant get out  then dunnid go sch follow the bus to the internchange,btohqsg
so i was trapped inside while the driver go for kopi in the canteen,btohqsg
when she went back to the bus she got the fright of her life,btohqsg
did you guys hear about putin winning the russian election just a few days ago,btohqsg
Bruh I kenna that so many times,btohqsg
Bruh what win  it was a walkover,btohqsg
wow i wld have never knowj,btohqsg
he still majority of the votes mah,btohqsg
Anyways he won't be in power too long more ah,btohqsg
The international airport for Moscow recently got attacked  it's only time,btohqsg
Help ghost is typing on my phone,btohqsg
No I don't think he will die soon but he will lose power soon,btohqsg
because that malevolent man murdered navalny,btohqsg
i was stuck to the seat strap and everyone leaving watched me struggle,btohqsg
Luckily the ghost never sent the message of nonsense here lol,btohqsg
then the driver closed the door without seeing me,btohqsg
You sure you never kenna hacked,btohqsg
And why were u the only one inside,btohqsg
It just happened just now  i will see if it happens again,btohqsg
Wah they asshole never help sia,btohqsg
lol thats what u get for supporting sjw idiot,btohqsg
i feel like im too tired to do anything,btohqsg
and my stomach also hurts when it didnt beforw,btohqsg
i slept 2h yst and i have to stay up till at least 3 today,btohqsg
I saw my tm cca cher at nex,btohqsg
Im sacrificing a whole day for interview prep when i got a major exam next week😢😢,btohqsg
But yet idk how long ‘soon’ can be coz nobody contacted me yet when the hr told me her colleague will contact me ‘soon’ for an interview,btohqsg
Are u ok  did u skip any meals?,btohqsg
ok in the morning approx 930am  i ate a bit of fruit cause like idw queuethen now i have real bad gastric pain,btohqsg
when before  i could last 1000 to 1400 with even less food and maybe a lil bit of pain but not as bad as jn,btohqsg
Poker is a form of investment,btohqsg
Do u hv gastric pills like actal tablets with u,btohqsg
I can never survive w/o food and yet still like to push limits…i will get a terrible nausea,btohqsg
would you rather panic after they tell you when your interview is,btohqsg
Meanwhile I’m doing intermittent fasting cos I wanna lose weight,btohqsg
I’ve gone 28h without food just a few days ago,btohqsg
I keep my eating time to between 4 to 8h a day,btohqsg
I think there were some studies that show with intermittent fasting you’re more likely to lose weight than cutting down the calories you consume daily by like 25%,btohqsg
I think i want to vomit,btohqsg
I want to do this coz i cant exercise much due to medical problem but i cant coz moment i dun eat i will get a terrible nausea,btohqsg
There is a routine to go about it for a couple of months but need a while to see results,btohqsg
What happens if you just keep drinking water to keep your stomach full?,btohqsg
Oh no i think u should go home to rest,btohqsg
Or make a trip to a clinic,btohqsg
So like you just restrict the number of calories you eat? No time restrictions?,btohqsg
But it will just make me puke more,btohqsg
Actually i dun think water is enough to compensate for real food,btohqsg
I can go for long without food just that I can’t sleep if I’m too hungry,btohqsg
Me is i cant study / focus if im hungry,btohqsg
intermittent fasting can plateau pretty quickly if that's all you rely on,btohqsg
and the optimal threshold for it differs between people,btohqsg
But funny when past 12mn i will feel v bloated + hungry at the same time,btohqsg
Yeah so I’ll wait 2 months and see what are the results,btohqsg
I think u can try optifast regimen,btohqsg
in short periods there are numerous benefits but try not to let it extend beyond 24 hours,btohqsg
your body might go into starvation mode and end up storing fats,btohqsg
Is better to follow proven things rather than trying ur own ways,btohqsg
It is available at all retail pharmacies i think,btohqsg
There is actually a medicine to burn fats but i dun think u want to go to that extreme lmao,btohqsg
most people don't need that and should not use it,btohqsg
Yeah I’ll try to avoid using any kind of medication,btohqsg
i mean this isn't really trying the own way,btohqsg
ill go eat smth so i dont feel like vomiting,btohqsg
isnt that meant for ppl who have severe diabetes or severely obese,btohqsg
like the baratic surgery (i def spell wrong),btohqsg
i'm not too familiar but i mean in general don't resort to medication for stuff you can achieve by just watching your diet and exercise,btohqsg
Not sure if anyone here will benefit from attending this but sharing anyway (hope it’s ok to share stuff)Celebrating World Happiness Day with the Happiness Initiativehttps://peatix.com/event/3866635It’s free  has a workshop and a fireside chat two invited speakers,btohqsg
i feel like i have more health issues than im supposed to,btohqsg
Do ppl skip lectures for interview or try to reschedule the interview,btohqsg
But if u are alr wanting to vomit  I suggest u try to vomit out first  the food will make it worst (speaking fr experience),btohqsg
Hi Andrea  i am xx from xx. We would like to shortlist you for a F2F interview for the role pre-registration interview on *21 March  9.45pm*?,btohqsg
i feel like im at this point in my life where i have nothing more to lose,btohqsg
so idm if i lose anything,btohqsg
because ive already lost the things that are the most impt to me,btohqsg
the person editted the message thrice,btohqsg
it became from 22 march 2.30pm to 21 march 9.45pm to giving me a choice,btohqsg
i would rather find excuse to skip my coding class on thurs,btohqsg
real..sometimes they talk a piece of crap and i feel better off researching online myself,btohqsg
like my lecture on cancer pain  the not prof is just yapping idk what he talking  his slides have no substance lmao,btohqsg
bio lectures make me sleepy. tell me something i dont know,btohqsg
lesson started at 240 but the teacher isnt here yet,btohqsg
Teacher is a well rounded lady,btohqsg
Ngl idm 2h of h2 bio,btohqsg
To those who graduated poly when did your diploma concession expire arh assuming April intake?,btohqsg
My gp lessons were all 1 period,btohqsg
But I wouldn’t want any of it coz idk what my cher is yapping,btohqsg
What help she change timing again,btohqsg
Wth is ‘pre-interview assessment test’ for 30min,btohqsg
Oops i forgot censor phone number lol,btohqsg
wth is that  no head no tail  first time see this sia,btohqsg
Even if it is hr and not pharm department  u hv this in the process can u just tell me what is that,btohqsg
Fun fact: the hospital has not opened yet,btohqsg
Ok i can guess what is it but first time i hear got pre-interview assessment,btohqsg
Idm 2h of h2 econs / h1 phy coz the only cher that can properly teach,btohqsg
"My gp teacher took one glance at my work and said ""good""",btohqsg
my friend purposely did not reply to me when i asked if he had this 30min assessment,btohqsg
but his 'omg' reaction tells something,btohqsg
what my friend just said 'im not telling',btohqsg
Why is WKW on itself with no shelter,btohqsg
like im just asking him  not asking him for answers,btohqsg
I'm stuck in gp : (,btohqsg
but i also dw drag it to friday,btohqsg
fml actually my friend is hinting that he did not have it,btohqsg
i think i will just take thurs...i dun really want to drag it to friday,btohqsg
hoping that i will be refreshed in the morning,btohqsg
and not get headache due to stress as well,btohqsg
nvm ill just steal glances at someone,btohqsg
Look I am not against that but I have to take my ICC-FC mods there,btohqsg
actually i hv a pharmacy in my bag  i will just pop a naproxen before i go in,btohqsg
meanwhile my pharm friend did not realise what i was taking was naproxen,btohqsg
im just thinking what kind of question will come out,btohqsg
i think should be 10-15 at max,btohqsg
ok WHAT my friend did not have it,btohqsg
I do the same but with Xanax,btohqsg
I gotta stay sedated for dis,btohqsg
Why does pharmacy take 2 hours to give me my panadol,btohqsg
Once i enter the workforce  u dunnid wait for 2h alr,btohqsg
But bruh panadol just go buy at community pharmacies,btohqsg
It's like 50 cents if u get it via prescription,btohqsg
Ok then cannot complain need queue,btohqsg
In singapore it is like that,btohqsg
I getting it because of the headache I have from bedok,btohqsg
I have abortive medication cuz of that,btohqsg
im tired and want to fall asleep while walking,btohqsg
I’m surprised it took her half the drink to find it floating around lol,btohqsg
The rain is making me wan to sleep,btohqsg
Anyone wants to sell their secondary 1 test/exam papers please pm me. Thank you 🙏🏼,btohqsg
And is about to get paid for it,btohqsg
i wanna vent but i wait for ppl to be active first,btohqsg
Wah paging the powerpuff girls ah,btohqsg
ok so today there was heavy rain,btohqsg
someone didn't bring umbrella and I wanted to lend but then I hesitated,btohqsg
then he shared with another guy and then yea,btohqsg
i had never met such kind soles sia:-( then i end up walking in the rain,btohqsg
I legit wanted to lend but then I was hesitating then I lost my chance :/,btohqsg
it happens....i always want to do it but too shy,btohqsg
Neither have I but I love rain,btohqsg
there will always be people who never bring umbrella and then it pours (like me lol),btohqsg
i got scolded before coz i came home all drenched and my phone was dead so i was uncontactable,btohqsg
Kenna Alot of time alr lol,btohqsg
ok but the thing is idk something wrong with me  when i sick  i totally cannot move,btohqsg
I once manage to catch a single fat water droplet as I reached school  I thought nothing if it until 2pm that day. I caught a fever and was gone from school for 2 weeks,btohqsg
damn it why is ntu winning,btohqsg
That water droplet not only gave me fever,btohqsg
That water droplet came from a roof drain 💀x2,btohqsg
meanwhile i had a 7 days hospitalization leave but then i tot i was well enough to go school on d2 coz my fever subsided after medication and i didnt want to skip lessons  then midway  my fever came back and my face suddenly turned pale...then after school  i suddenly could not walk any longer...like i had to hold the railings when walking down the stairs...then begged my father to fetch me from school lol,btohqsg
after discharge  i got fever for 3 days:-(,btohqsg
I've only been to the hospital cause the optometrist scheduled me to go there cause of my eyes,btohqsg
i had to make a trip to the hosp coz doctor suspected apendicitis and then stupid insurance only cover inpatient  so i just stay there 1 night lmao,btohqsg
actually after these stupid enough incidents  my family boycotted that clinic,btohqsg
there was once the doctor gave me a diagnosis of arthritis when i was 18,btohqsg
but my mum pretended she did not hear anything,btohqsg
Today's one everyone was sucking up to the organisation,btohqsg
"""Omg xxx is so amazing"" "" xxx has done alot sia what can I EVER do to replace it""",btohqsg
I just realised there's no loss,btohqsg
There's a 1/35 chance of them identifying me,btohqsg
i asked my dad to check my answers so i wun say something stupid and he told me he cannot bring himself to say those,btohqsg
And pls lor if ur only way to success is sukcing up I feel bad for you,btohqsg
but i mean most people do interviews like that lol,btohqsg
Anyways did anything interesting happen today,btohqsg
Don't worry they won't care  most govt orgs have too much shit to handle than a partial whistleblower,btohqsg
No it's just the other students,btohqsg
idrc abt what nparks think of me,btohqsg
I don't think nparks care about their image as a organisation either,btohqsg
Like q honestly I don't need the scholarship cuz i alr have nus one I would like it but it's not like I desperately need it,btohqsg
Honestlt the benefits are the same,btohqsg
Doesn't everyone who's 90 get it,btohqsg
idk wat that is but got global,btohqsg
Do you have h3s dist or good ECs?,btohqsg
And yes I have h3 dist,btohqsg
it benefits those 90rp that have poor character,btohqsg
coz they get free access to it,btohqsg
What do you define by goof,btohqsg
wait randkmdkd you did h3 geog?,btohqsg
8 distinction is got h3 dist what,btohqsg
I wrote abt something that there's not enough research done in SG abt,btohqsg
I didn't need to go interview,btohqsg
but almost everyone with 90rp have the scholarrship tho,btohqsg
Oh I had nus usp interview,btohqsg
i know nus scholarship cut off is 97.5,btohqsg
oh yea nus college just recently,btohqsg
maybe with the nus college  then they do things differentlu,btohqsg
H3 geog was so fun tho ngl,btohqsg
the only cancer part was my research topic was on smth that hasnt been done in Singapore yet,btohqsg
i wished i could take h3 chem,btohqsg
oh i went for h3 chem lessons,btohqsg
but i was only offered h3 math,btohqsg
Wait is this full ride scholarship or what,btohqsg
what is a full ride scholarship,btohqsg
idk bro they just pay for everything,btohqsg
a classmate also want go ej,btohqsg
OYA I RMBR WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY NOW,btohqsg
Oh yeah that is a full ride scholarship,btohqsg
he went combine so its easier,btohqsg
goddamit y i nvr do that,btohqsg
Speaking of Interview I remember rejecting NTU cause they made me go for an interview to go to their course,btohqsg
and in my head was like,btohqsg
Idh the time for this im not that desperate for u anyways,btohqsg
so i just didnt turn up for the interview,btohqsg
"I was very much like ""know your worth"" and i was like pls if NTU makes me ABA for their course im like I aint got time for that shit",btohqsg
apart from people telling me im too bouncy/energetic,btohqsg
why wud u ever wanna go ej,btohqsg
Apparently my cohort did badly for their first GP wa tested mainly on summary P2 and just AQ,btohqsg
Okay ngl thats a bad way of testing,btohqsg
u should either do full paper,btohqsg
its q popular wat  newer campus and we are in the northeast area,btohqsg
I mean it is what it is,btohqsg
The SAQs check if you understand major details and concepts in the author text before you critique it at a micro levelThe SQ checks if you understand major details and concepts in the author's text before you critique it at a macro levelThe AQ is the overall critique,btohqsg
it can very easily lead to students not knowing wtf theyre writing,btohqsg
Uk end up Cher gave 1 PT 1 mark for summary,btohqsg
just sitting in the corner  no idea abt gp,btohqsg
Because otherwise alotta ppl would have failed failed,btohqsg
i feel the way schs teach summary,btohqsg
i find it easier to do summary,btohqsg
if you cancel out what is irrelevant,btohqsg
rather than find what is relevant,btohqsg
Altho she got mention that it's not the real As marking scheme,btohqsg
But idt anyone gives a shit yet because they're taking it next yr,btohqsg
oh i used this example to teach,btohqsg
Ye iirc 2-3 PT 1 mark is it,btohqsg
relative vs absolute importance for GP,btohqsg
normally its q standard 15 pts for full 8 marks,btohqsg
but sometimes if the text has less points then they will adjust,btohqsg
so it can actually be 1 pt 1 mark,btohqsg
I wish i had more gp students,btohqsg
isit called tagging people or @ing ppl,btohqsg
maybe i shud monetise my worksheets,btohqsg
Only the ogs will know paging,btohqsg
It's my own self designed worksheets,btohqsg
And when I designed it I tried to make it so that people can do it without extra guidance,btohqsg
So its more of a platform to bounce ideas off,btohqsg
Like if u do it with someone,btohqsg
"Fyi AQ qn was "" To what extent should multiculturalism policies smth smth in your society "" LOL I can't rmb alrd but alot of ppl misinterpreted the qn as ""oh yes there should be multiculturalism policies in my society"" or smth",btohqsg
But ppl simply wrote oh there should be such policies in our society,btohqsg
Okay nvm I need see the full preamble,btohqsg
Cambridge hasn't tested topics where u need such high barriers to understand the content before,btohqsg
Oh yea also across my cohort highest was 6/12 or smth,btohqsg
The closest was 2018 abt political apathy,btohqsg
I forgot that's under which component for AQ/summary,btohqsg
So that students can properly answer it,btohqsg
Oh wait no ard 6-8 ISH only,btohqsg
Most students get 3/10 for aq last time,btohqsg
I am a firm believer of schs don't teach aq properly they just force fit a structure and make u like write it,btohqsg
They don't actuslly tell students why aq is even being tested in the first place,btohqsg
AND HONESTLY I FEEL IF U TELL THEM WHAT RHIS IS NATURALLY UR GRADES WILL GO UP,btohqsg
ngl I appreciate content dumping but my Cher doesn't rlly review the skill required to ATQ for AQ properly,btohqsg
like man I even have a GP self help guide book to guide my thought process,btohqsg
I read it during her lessons cause imo it felt more helpful than wtv was taught during gp,btohqsg
"Funny thing is I didn't even try hiding it LOL and the moment she noticed she went "" ooh what's that? Oh for gp is it ? Does it help"" "" ya"" *stares a bit  nods her head and walks off*",btohqsg
Also I forgot I wanted to respond to this,btohqsg
The only real benefit of ej is new campus,btohqsg
I firmly believe that the grades have nth to do with the ability of the teachers but more of just we naturally get stronger students,btohqsg
TJ is still the sch with the best chers IMHO,btohqsg
Guys you know I just realise  I kinda look like amos yee,btohqsg
TJ getting harder and harder pein,btohqsg
This is also why sugaresque has decent distinction rates,btohqsg
From what I heard she doesn't accept,btohqsg
idk y i always misread as squarespace,btohqsg
was she the 1 got called out for plagiarising?,btohqsg
I like what the signs says and you look into the distance💀,btohqsg
This is why there's only one good,btohqsg
But he has comparable distinction rates to other places,btohqsg
n said she had a team behind her,btohqsg
i kinda wanna do this with physics ngl,btohqsg
Which is fucking cheap for tuition,btohqsg
I see she is already training to become a future minister,btohqsg
that has to be sarcasm bruh,btohqsg
damn and i thought i was lowballing myself at 30/hr,btohqsg
my current 1s charge 40/hr lol,btohqsg
Being from RI = a free pas to success,btohqsg
I'll charge 10/hr after I grad,btohqsg
you’ll need to pay people to hire you,btohqsg
You didn't hire me when u needed therapy,btohqsg
Si Yan will go to Josh for therapy,btohqsg
It’s a mix la. Otherwise the mean RP ranking will simply follow the L1R5 intake ranking exactly but it does not. Schools do study how much they value-added their students  mostly on individual subject basis,btohqsg
Uk I didn't know disc ppl can talk like that until they talk like that,btohqsg
But at least in ej I feel it's mostly cause of the students themselves,btohqsg
My cher openly told us their poor grades,btohqsg
And they are the worst of my few chers lol,btohqsg
i mean to me it’s like 90% the students and 10% the teachers,btohqsg
Maybe being a sociopath helps me acing that job,btohqsg
Also cause EJ does banding based on L1R5,btohqsg
ye dam interesting how NJC isnt that high up,btohqsg
the strong students have their ways of doing well even with shit teachers in my experience,btohqsg
wonder how tj continues to be so competitive  was it after new principle or smth?,btohqsg
Well  of course it may not be equal contribution by the students themselves vs teachers,btohqsg
Wonder how sp dropped in poly position,btohqsg
No but in the eyes of the public,btohqsg
i’ve always viewed teachers as just another learning resource students have access to,btohqsg
I made it to the finals of a international competition before to represent SG,btohqsg
it’s just the most convenient one,btohqsg
But I got replaced in the team because I wasn't from RI,btohqsg
And they wanted a full RI team,btohqsg
It was 3 RI + me,btohqsg
And I got replaced for this,btohqsg
But itsojay we live laugh love,btohqsg
I know at least 2 RI students with no character,btohqsg
Ik this cause I called the org who selected the members and that's what they told me,btohqsg
and also the environment with the peers ard u lol,btohqsg
And the 3rd one is medicine so imagine 1y later u will see such a doctor out there,btohqsg
But it is a fact in singapore that doctors are overrated,btohqsg
I wanted to apply for medicine,btohqsg
But a lot of countries out there pharmacist has so much more power,btohqsg
So I can cut people open,btohqsg
Issok. Anyway  i was in TJ in an era when MJ did not exist wahaha. All the best in getting into TJ!,btohqsg
But I decided to go geog in the end,btohqsg

Oh that's what my RI friend also complains to me abt,btohqsg
But tbf that's a fair complaint,btohqsg
ITS jut a matter of personal space,btohqsg

From memory someone wrote that artists are undervalued cuz the government censors them,btohqsg
I thought I'm going crazy fml,btohqsg
Rhe guy was just forcefitting an arts essat,btohqsg
It’s tough being upset all the time; so should try to just amplify whatever happiness there is and can be amplified in whatever circumstance and environmentNeed to talk more to Master Shifu and Master Wugui,btohqsg
feel like i try to escape from it too much lol  until the stress hits me,btohqsg
I mean it's alot of effort to act happy too,btohqsg
Consider the view that artists are undervalued in the modern world,btohqsg
Me too. PTSD after Os so I took Fmath instead of triple science,btohqsg
then i need to cram for exams,btohqsg
Until I read bad gp essays,btohqsg

😭😭😭 your umbrella is like those portable ones? amirite,btohqsg
Ya my recent timed pract one is horrible,btohqsg
because if thatʼs the case it will be super difficult for you to share your umbrella  like one of you has to get soaked in the rain,btohqsg
I genuinely tryna bullshit so hard for ai,btohqsg
Don’t act. Find what makes you happy and amplify it. It can be a scenery that you enjoy; it can be a drink that your canteen sells,btohqsg
no i just wanted to give them and zao,btohqsg
cause i didnt need the umbrella because someone was coming to pick me up,btohqsg
and the person going home via public transport,btohqsg
do you know that person though?,btohqsg
nah im not sharing an umbrella with him,btohqsg
or is it some random stranger,btohqsg
ok you are def gonna scold me for this,btohqsg
i kinda wanted to find an excuse to talk to him 💀,btohqsg
Omg it makes me feel my gp teacher is really an*******,btohqsg
i mean if hes some random stranger,btohqsg
Hahaha COE applies to emotions and negative energy too. Do what you need to dissipate the (negative) energy,btohqsg
then theres pretty much no chance of him returning your umbrella back to you,btohqsg
i realised that gp teachers are either very good or horribletheres no mid gp teacher,btohqsg
1) i dun hv gp homework for 2y2) he is always kinda late for class3) he just scribbles stuff on the whiteboard,btohqsg
It also means low-key kicking myself out of a clique in my class LMAOOO,btohqsg
i took a big fat nap,btohqsg
oh btw today my gp teacher was late by 20min,btohqsg
She thought the period start at 3pm and sch end at 5pm,btohqsg
Continue (he is my pw cher too)1) he miss a couple of our lessons citing ‘pw committee commitments’2) he barely guided during lessons and left us alone3) our class started op rehearsals much later than the other classes coz of point 1,btohqsg
Sigh such teachers also earn $$,btohqsg
Eh u know what is best  i digged out my gp chat and then i realised there were a few days he didnt turn up w/o telling us and then people had to ask him in the chat for his whereabouts,btohqsg
this type of the tchers js want the money and fk off,btohqsg
Wait this one the one ur parent scream at ?,btohqsg
Maybe we should hv gone to the chat w the other cher i side💀💀,btohqsg
At least they did not tape their door shut,btohqsg
Hmmmm personally i find my friends from school to be the most precious bunch and I am mighty glad i keep in contact with some of my sec/JC/uni friendsFor example  my jc cca exco friends would meet up for dinner yearly,btohqsg
Then said oops accident the chat too similar names,btohqsg
