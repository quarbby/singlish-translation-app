Oh ya. ShopBack I also got use. üòäüëç,btohqsg
what were your last few transactions?dodgey types? or legitimate retail spending?,btohqsg
Confirmed Legitimate. Payment to oversea Uni leh,btohqsg
eh wait your case sounds familar..you were the one where amaze asked you for additional verification right?,btohqsg
Yup. I asked them again and they said their internal review deemed I not qualified,btohqsg
and if i not wrong  education should be excluded from amaze points.i paid a horse riding school with amaze and not given any points,btohqsg
Wow must have triggered some red flags with compliance,btohqsg
Dun give points is okay. Why cancelled my card,btohqsg
it is a bit hard to conclude given we don't know your details:1. is it a customer issue?2. is it a transaction issue?,btohqsg
Not sure. All cards I applied were success within hours or days.,btohqsg
Dun know  I will use trust card in future. Bye Amaze,btohqsg
my 'guess' is amaze doesn't like big payments to non retail like transactions/merchants.,btohqsg
May I know the oversea university name or the oversea company you pay to? Is this the only transaction?,btohqsg
Hi check with you. When the interest is only for top up values   but not our account balance,btohqsg
To earn bonus points for DBS WWMC the transaction must be posted within calendar month ?,btohqsg
posted date. only dbs is transaction date,btohqsg
For this EVOL card  can I do 300 online and 300 mobile contactless to fulfil the 600 required spending?,btohqsg
Hi expert  may I check whether is there any credit card that has no minimum spend and can be used on utilities bills (eg. M1  Giga  SP utilities and Tuas Power) and insurance bills?,btohqsg
Ok thanks will take a look üôè,btohqsg
For insurance you can also consider paying using card up,btohqsg
i got a question  when i want to redeem flights using miles  can i redeem from multiple accounts? eg my account + wife account?,btohqsg
as in use miles from different accounts for 1 ticket? of cos not,btohqsg
2 tickets  my ticket + wife ticket. but in 1 booking,btohqsg
for asiamiles  no  you can use 1 account to purchase multiple tickets provided the person is on your list. i guess 1 way around it is to transfer the miles from your wife to you or vice versa,btohqsg
can book separately 1 ticket from your account  1 ticket from your wife account.,btohqsg
I think only child's can tie to their parents  not spouse,btohqsg
i have a question on redemption of $ from cash solutions in fsm one to personal account - does anyone know how long it will take?,btohqsg
oh that makes sense  then js check in together to sit together?,btohqsg
can choose ur own seats? If not can call airline to group the two bookings together,btohqsg
In short  You book own ticket using own miles. Wife book own ticket using her miles. During seat selection  choose seat side by side. Settled,btohqsg
but what if i spend 80% of the amount  wife spend 20%,btohqsg
Hi  regarding the Paynow Option. Can I just Paynow from my own bank account and indicate as salary?,btohqsg
Give and take lor. Use her UOB Lady's card earn 6 mpd. Family combined expenses very hard to be clear cut. Surely will have one more savvy than the other,btohqsg
need to plan ahead such that there is either enough miles to get both tickets from one account or 1 ticket from each account.,btohqsg
SC Simply Cash. Rebate works for M1 recurring.,btohqsg
Alternatively  get those with free Supp card. The 20% spending save the points until it's enough for 1 flight then other times just redeem from your account.With your Kris account  you can redeem flight for her even if you are not travelling. (add her to the nominee),btohqsg
Pay telco works too? Is there a tracker within the UOB app to track the online/contactless spending or have to manually calculate?,btohqsg
How about cashback  points or Airmiles? Those CC with free priority pass usage isit good?,btohqsg
Oh can transfer miles? In the card or sia?,btohqsg
Tracker only for Uob one account,btohqsg
Use cardup to pay insurance and utilities using UOB privi miles works,btohqsg
HiI have hotel billed to be paid by aug amount 13kWhat miles credit card is good?,btohqsg
Hsbc cc only max 1k spending for 4 miles per $,btohqsg
Hi everyone  do you know if NTUC FairPrice vouchers count towards the min spending for the new to bank offer?,btohqsg
i know can do it for asia miles  not sure about others,btohqsg

I have used EGA few yrs ago.closef it after interest.benefits no different but hsbc not a bank I recommend unless u hv biz in hk or need to act to transact. Consumers best stick w other banks no matter how good promo. CeO of hsbc learned 7mil income even tho' biz climate not good. Hk had protests  china not do well .!!. Customers at their mercy,btohqsg
Welcome rewards are attractive for new signups. Get those low hanging rewards first. Then try a little paper trading to get a feel. Long term you will find which one suits you better,btohqsg
