sorry but crossover design is the dumbest idea ever. either be a SUV or be a sedan/hatch/coupe. if you choose this means you cannot  make up your mind,btohqsg
my personal opinion though anyone is free to disagree,btohqsg
Generally now anything suv sell better then sedan and sports car   but to make up for the looks and handling they come out with cross over !!!,btohqsg
Yup   as suv is top seller,btohqsg
Even urus is top selllee for lambo,btohqsg
Now ppl want big car comfy,btohqsg
Like such can even do party,btohqsg
i think only bmw SUV not outselling their sedans,btohqsg
Their x1 I see is selling well but the 216 seems more popular,btohqsg
216 is more like a 5 seater MPV,btohqsg
Sell untill Honda can‚Äôt believe it,btohqsg
haha big car mostly out of stock..,btohqsg
Soon All mpv become suv also,btohqsg
i think still got market for cheap family cars like wish,btohqsg
Any car on heels sell better,btohqsg
okay la some are not too bad,btohqsg
i love my XC40!Polester 2 is a crossover i think? Pretty nice to drive also leh haha,btohqsg
polestar is a brick though  heavier than tesla even,btohqsg
My only problem with crossover suv is that Singaporeans think higher means easier to drive...,btohqsg
higher easier to miss curb  easier to hit curb and easier to flip,btohqsg
the only reason i'll ever get a SUV or crossover is if my family has mobility issue,btohqsg
no wonder vezel drivers see themselves as king of the road,btohqsg
ok le  i drive sedan suv within the same day  not much difference,btohqsg
I had a 2 door GTI... great drive other than the  fact that VW = visit workshop,btohqsg
i took note what u said before  but if i did not buy one  how to try,btohqsg
i eyeing one  but the best time to buy is covid period,btohqsg
