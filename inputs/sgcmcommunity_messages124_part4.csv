I rmb seeing his convoy before,btohqsg
Used to drive ls300 back in the day  zippy car nice handling. major turbo lag tho,btohqsg
Ngl im still trying to feel dis turbo lag for myself,btohqsg
I dun feel it in my current car,btohqsg
Unless you just can't tell the difference,btohqsg
but for some reason this current car has lesser bhp 1.5 compared to 1.6,btohqsg
then again diesel torque is high  so not really a fair comparison,btohqsg
but at some points  i do feel abit of lag when i wanna accelerate fast  can feel abit of lag. but its not sooo significant,btohqsg
Floor the pedal from 0 you can defn feel it,btohqsg
Yours company stingy. Use es300 easy maintain and more betters resell value than conti? Calculatives,btohqsg
Diesel low end torque very high,btohqsg
Unless you drive the same exact car,btohqsg
I recall your previous car being an SUV,btohqsg
If his mouth stingy  we wouldn't have an issue,btohqsg
Diesel won't struggle as much when you have a heavy load.,btohqsg
huh? my prev car sedan bro,btohqsg
i haven had the opportunity to drive an SUV yet,btohqsg
Is just diesel engine doesn't have as much explosive power,btohqsg
And diesel helps with the low end torque a bit,btohqsg
It's more like a slow burn,btohqsg
Most diesels tuned for low end,btohqsg
Like you don't use LNG to do BBQ  you use charcoal,btohqsg
i was talking about i dun feel turbo lag in the current car  then compare to a NA really not much difference LOL,btohqsg
need the torque to actually tow shit,btohqsg
that's why SAF vehicles mostly diesel still,btohqsg
Diesel engines are just more torquey and consistent with power and do so while being efficient,btohqsg
Hence all heavy vehicles tend to be diesel,btohqsg
Because they can pull weight and be efficient,btohqsg
You try running a petrol semi,btohqsg
You will need to refuel way more often or have huge tanks,btohqsg
But I went to the airport tech exhibition at MBS on wed  quite a few Chinese companies now have EV for ground support vehicle,btohqsg
technically speaking wouldn't EVs have high torque too?,btohqsg
But the torque is dependent on the motor rating,btohqsg
Towing with an ev is still not as efficient as a diesel,btohqsg
honestly china is one of the big players in EV  so im not really surprised tho. my qn is the downtime to charge,btohqsg
Because you get all the torque at the start,btohqsg
But due to single speed gearboxes and no power graph as such,btohqsg
Your torque is just there at the start,btohqsg
So you tend to run out of juice a lot quicker,btohqsg
That's why you see Tesla semi is a very different model of powertrain  from the motors to power delivery,btohqsg
Yup that's why Teslas still lose in a circuit to supercars but win at drag races,btohqsg
Try watching the carwow drags with the 992 turbo s vs taycan turbo s,btohqsg
I once had an argument with someone on a Tesla forum regarding lap times of a Tesla on track and how they're the best cars ever,btohqsg
Compared them to some track specific cars/performance cars,btohqsg
"Was told ""come on the cars used tuned for track  Tesla is stock""",btohqsg
People are rolling up to drag strips in the US in model 3s and beating supercars in a 1/4 mile ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
1/4 mile sure  what about after the mile. And drag races are only fun for a bit,btohqsg
You've beaten the fastest road car,btohqsg
Track driving is just more involving and actually skill based and fun,btohqsg
Invite the Tesla to 99 bends,btohqsg
