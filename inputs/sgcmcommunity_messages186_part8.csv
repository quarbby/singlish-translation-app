i was shock that the GLC and GLB interior feels so cramped,btohqsg
even the GLA feels abit bigger,btohqsg
The GL series is for people who wanna drive merc but don’t have the budget. I really don’t understand why they sell  they’re crap cars. Buy C series better,btohqsg

See the price of the GLC,btohqsg
Sorry noob question.. these prices are Coe inclusive right?,btohqsg

1 Grande RoadOrchard BuildingIs the worst,btohqsg
2 way carpark built for 1 car to pass through,btohqsg
Only wide enough for one car,btohqsg
anyone knows wat is the website where u can search the car numb plate up and see the reliability test  accident and all and specs,btohqsg
we need a full series covering this,btohqsg
i vote for Lido car park. Not the worst but complete garbage. it is literally impossible to park 3 cars side by side with anything larger than a mini (while still being able to get out of your car). plus the layout of the carpark is confusing trash,btohqsg
the old golden mile car park was horrendous too. the kerbs and pillars are full of damage from clipping cars. Some of the kerbs looks like the leftovers of an artillery attack with entire chunks missing LOL,btohqsg
The newer Honda Fit’s windscreen quite big. Slopes down towards the bonnet,btohqsg
When scrap car  is it good idea to strip car down to engine and chassis to be sold to scrapyard?,btohqsg
Ya minimum need engine and chassis,btohqsg
But even the engine parts u can take out some,btohqsg
The catalytic converter is already more than the whole car scrap value offered by scrapyard,btohqsg
But Quite troublesome need place to store,btohqsg
you know why  i know why…,btohqsg
ya man nicer than the renault,btohqsg
Can I check what is the interest rate for bank loan for car few years ago…?I see online now is about 2.9% ish. My friend told me she bought hers with loan at 2.3% when COE was 35k. Just wondering what’s the market rate for bank interest rate pls,btohqsg
When COE was 35k in 2019 bank interest was low,btohqsg
Last 2 years fed interest hikes that's why loan interest increased,btohqsg
