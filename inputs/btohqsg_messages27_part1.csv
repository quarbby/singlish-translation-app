Hi everyone quick qns. I am a second timer and used MCPS to buy my 1st BTO.Now that I MOP redy  when I apply in Oct launch as second timer  the HDB portal is asking again if I want to apply under MCPS.What should I do?,btohqsg

hi I applied for June bto! August I got my ballot number September end I got an appointment date  my booking was just recently on 14 Oct:),btohqsg
Confirm huat. Price also not bad. Waiting time 38months only,btohqsg
How much do you think the future price would be?,btohqsg
Btw  the seaview havnt include the view of msia and pulau ubin,btohqsg
Depends how long after results that HDB starts selection (they will stagger diff projects start month) + how good your queue number is,btohqsg
Hi all..this should answer yes or no ...own a bto and applying as 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi owner! I'm one of the admins you added. Could you pls PM me so I could ask about adding some filters to Rose to minimize spam? Thank you!!,btohqsg
Can check when u apply HFE  if 9 months ltr ur financial situation changed such that ur household income isn't below $14k  can u still bto/resale for govt flats?,btohqsg
Hi just wanna ask if now I apply for October bto   but if I also want apply for sbf for the Feb 25 bto is it possible but will it still be consider as first timer or second ?,btohqsg
IF your q no for Oct is out of supply  you can apply for SBF/BTO for Feb and you will be 1st timerIF your q no for Oct is within supply  cannot apply,btohqsg
Ooh okay thanks . But is only after the ballot then get queue number right ?,btohqsg
Yep roughly almost 2 months after application,btohqsg
Hi if deferred income  roughly when will they start assessing the income?,btohqsg
Taman jurong skyline so low rate ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
This one best to ask HDB directly!,btohqsg
Ya la. But roughly can predict itâ€™s one of the unpopular projects. I think biggest reason is 4+yrs waiting time.,btohqsg
Hi may I ask  is there any difference between the 1st and 2nd Applicants stated in the HFE?,btohqsg
not much diff - 1st applicant usually will be the correspondence in terms of providing address for hdb to send letters and all,btohqsg
But can those details be changed anywhere or anytime during application process?,btohqsg
not sure  didnt change till i signed,btohqsg
Hello all  can check? So ethnic group is to choose during application period like now? But my friend just applied  no option on this part when they're applying (but they're both indian)  where's mine is chinese malay.,btohqsg
The marsiling site used to be a primary school  already demolished.,btohqsg
I am already waiting for UV to be ready  already got a flat in that project.,btohqsg
does anyone know when the bto will start to register?,btohqsg
Most probably near the end of Oct,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I apply wrongly  can cancel and apply again ?,btohqsg
Best to apply on last day so u can think carefully before submit,btohqsg
Hi anyone have the floor plan or layout plan of the today BTO Oct 2024 launch especiallyBayshore PalmKembanganCrawford height,btohqsg
Anyone know beside Bayshore Vista there is a Medical health care centre is it Polyclinic or Elderly Home ?,btohqsg
If you go to project page  scroll down past the pictures til you can select the room type  then choose the room type  it will show the room layoutExample of room layout shown below (from Pasir Ris Oct 2024),btohqsg
4 rm (394 units)Internal floor area 90sqm$481k - $595k,btohqsg
anyone knows if can we locate each storey unit plan ?,btohqsg
Not sure why a medical facility is there but curious is it for Elderly home ...and then there is Rental Units ..are they for Low income family can rent from HDB ?,btohqsg
Not out yet  it'll be released sometime after results,btohqsg
Not sure why the Architect place the Multi storey Carpark and the BiN  right in front of Sea View together with a Proposed Health & Medical Care ..with the 3 block behind .. much to the anticipated East Coast View with 20 Rental Units and 21 storey high only,btohqsg
Acts as a buffer from expressway,btohqsg
Can be quite noisy at ecp,btohqsg
Ok .... maybe I go for Crawford,btohqsg

In the end rly down to luck still. Extra ballot chances help in the sense that you have more chances for your name to be drawn  but imagine 1:1000 people applying vs 2:1000 people applying  the % increase in probability is not much. Of course if application rate is low eg 200 ppl apply  1:200 vs 2:200  more ballot chances will affect more greatly,btohqsg
Does anyone have 121e Tengah floor plan ?,btohqsg
Perhaps you wanna ask in your project grp chat?,btohqsg
Asking the same too  if applying as first timer for bto but already have old hdb?,btohqsg
If application for project is less than 70% of the units  will they cancel the project?,btohqsg
hihi  can i check in the bto application  you can only select the estate  and not the specific project within the estate?if thats the case then does that mean you can only get 1 queue number for only 1 project within the estate?,btohqsg
U will only get 1 queue number and u can choose the project u wanna apply for if ur number is good,btohqsg
Dont think they will cancell  still build and rest for SBF maybe,btohqsg
