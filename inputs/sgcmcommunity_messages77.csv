Halimah yacob now giving out loan?,btohqsg
For legal reasons t‚Äôwas a joke,btohqsg
Cannot lah HAHAHAH I think headlight important,btohqsg
I went to tint it is to protect  but for the fun of it I went for the darker ones  and now is like cannot see my headlights Liao,btohqsg
You might have gone too dark,btohqsg
To protect can just do transparent PPF also,btohqsg
Maybe go for a very light smoke next,btohqsg
You can get those tinted PPF film,btohqsg
Creates a good tint without affecting your headlight‚Äôs brightness,btohqsg
And they usually have a super light tint,btohqsg
Arnav knows someone who did it,btohqsg
I love how this community is growing with more and more positive vibers!!,btohqsg
But no growth in my rickshaw business :(,btohqsg
I haven't seen your car Mr Aaron,btohqsg
I decided to park it too.,btohqsg
East side breezy but scared rain later,btohqsg
Later my white sneakers turn grey,btohqsg
HOw you know he drives an Audi  Mr@awj_mood?,btohqsg
Because of this picture Mr Aaron sent,btohqsg
Rims* later someone come out scold you,btohqsg
so blue colour means must call rims ah?,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing plate  I will try to spot you while riding around the city,btohqsg
You amaze me on a daily basis,btohqsg
ONLY if blue  then can be called Rim.,btohqsg
How does one define a ‚Äúwheel‚Äù,btohqsg
What if the spoke is blue,btohqsg
The wheels on the bus go round and round,btohqsg
a circular object that revolves on an axle and is fixed below a vehicle or other object to enable it to move easily over the ground.,btohqsg
Wow  looks like your mom used the same rhyme as mine,btohqsg
@anwo252I think we found another long lost brother,btohqsg
Soon we will have a whole village!,btohqsg
blue part os called a lip,btohqsg
Are you having the best freaking time of your life,btohqsg
Then we takeover at the sgcm meet,btohqsg
You‚Äôre in good shape my friend.,btohqsg
Then@SGCM_AdminJER will be out of job sir.,btohqsg
This wheel rim thing is confusing,btohqsg
Rims wheels as long as people Understand,btohqsg
Rims is the left diagram. Right side is Blue = Lip  white = barrel and i think uk what a spoke is,btohqsg
No  they will have more time to enjoy the meet :),btohqsg
That's why call it round thing on car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a doughnut okay? Not wheel. Not rim. Doughnuts!,btohqsg
Depends if you‚Äôre right or a bell end,btohqsg
If the 4 on the car are donut  then what about the spare one in the boot?,btohqsg
They call that one donut wheel also,btohqsg
I ate mine already  can I have yours,btohqsg
Depends on the process taken. Some donuts are bread. Some are considered a cake.,btohqsg
I think you have mistaken a donut for.... A PANDAN CAKE!!!,btohqsg
If not yeast raised  it is a cake.,btohqsg
No that's all I have to eat today,btohqsg
And the donut got hole or filling?,btohqsg
Affordable meals for all kinds of people,btohqsg
How many hole does jeans have,btohqsg
Non yeast raised  such as baking powder quick kind  is CAKE,btohqsg
3 if you don't count pockets and belt straps,btohqsg
How many holes does a tissue cardboard tube have,btohqsg
oh... but jeans is technically made out of woven fiber... and in between those fibre there are holes,btohqsg
I think the tube has one hole,btohqsg
But holes make a thing not whole,btohqsg
So a whole hole is making something not whole?,btohqsg
Does a net have more holes the more it‚Äôs torn?,btohqsg
What if the thing is meant to have a hole  without which it is not considered a whole?,btohqsg
What comes in dry and comes out wet,btohqsg
But the size of the holes bigger,btohqsg
well if we are gonna count the whole holes we have to take into account hole made by the thread unless it is made out of a 1 piece whole nylon,btohqsg
at this rate we gonna win prize le,btohqsg
I thought that‚Äôs what we are all secretly doing,btohqsg
Water is wet  in the sense of being a liquid which flows easily  because its viscosity is low  which is because its molecules are rather loosely joined together.,btohqsg
For something to be wet  it needs to be surrounded by water,btohqsg
As of now my t-shirt because very hot,btohqsg
does wet just mean water has dissolved the item or is in contact with the item,btohqsg
WOAH sir save it for 2am,btohqsg
so technically when your pants is wet  it really isnt,btohqsg
wow last i heard that is called soda,btohqsg
No if it is flavoured still water,btohqsg
so if i add milo powder,btohqsg
Got a lot of weird things one,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the difference between milo and milo-flavored water,btohqsg
but then when u add flavouring to water  isnt it just diluted flavouring???,btohqsg
I personally love the le mans,btohqsg
I think you watch to see the driver get thrown out,btohqsg
formula 1 is the most popular motorsport race in history  i think they made it,btohqsg
Why Le when it is a plural s in Mans?,btohqsg
Why is it called a building if it‚Äôs already built,btohqsg
"""its a 5 mins install""3hrs later "" HEY GUYS CHRIFIX HERE""",btohqsg
swift is slow even thought itsvalled swift,btohqsg
Unless you add an extra ‚ÄòS‚Äô behind,btohqsg
Like adding an ‚ÄòR‚Äô to my car,btohqsg
Closed whenever we want to go,btohqsg
They want the cars to go faster,btohqsg
But I always have time for my SGCM bros,btohqsg
dont you want to go faster?,btohqsg
Like the one they give for ipad,btohqsg
Yes for us turbo just add weight,btohqsg
Everyday is leg day if you think about it,btohqsg
Especially if I ride their rickshaw,btohqsg
Just walking does not exercise a lot of your leg muscles,btohqsg
i want to try ride yoursüòã,btohqsg
If you walk to your fridge no lah,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
What if I walk to my fridge from the airport?,btohqsg
I think you are too atas to ride it sir,btohqsg
we can trade rickshaw for car!,btohqsg
do you want me to give you an X6m????,btohqsg
What will I do with X6M,btohqsg
Show it to the whole world,btohqsg
My village we usually use Chariots Of Fire,btohqsg
But I always finish on debussy,btohqsg
ok Winter is good to admittedly,btohqsg
PAY 1k ++ FOR PS5 FOR WHAT,btohqsg
or lucky to get the preorder,btohqsg
i dont have... does that mean i am unlucky and smart??,btohqsg
I just enjoyed Vidui this morning too,btohqsg
You should check out candlelight if you don‚Äôt know,btohqsg
after you have checked out vidui,btohqsg
I go take them around first,btohqsg
I really love how he can portray each season so perfectly,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to hibernate in Winter and he is not letting me,btohqsg

And how to keep ants away from my car  the place I park in school always have a lot of ants  like be it parking under the tree or in open area  always will have ants and some debris from trees,btohqsg
I think ants and cockroach are inevitable,btohqsg
One wrong parking is all it takes,btohqsg
If can remove immediately. If not fine on the spot. Like illegal window tint,btohqsg
Don't fomo bro  our time will come! - J,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt lie. You‚Äôre just sitting in an empty room alone right?,btohqsg

It‚Äôs okay to be bipolar. Don‚Äôt shame them,btohqsg

I need to see why Mr Imran thinks J break many hearts,btohqsg
My school  carpark is all open area,btohqsg

Try parking in a lot away from trees or grass if you can,btohqsg
You know you‚Äôre good when someone thinks you‚Äôre using a bot,btohqsg
No I think you nothing to do,btohqsg
Shag alright  else is only ants trap will do the work?,btohqsg
Gonna wash my car later thought,btohqsg

But I don't eat in the vehicle as well so that helps,btohqsg
And clean the insides every week,btohqsg
