In j1 i tried fasting from coffee i died bruh,btohqsg
Kena withdrawal symptoms or sth   lethargic 24/7,btohqsg
So if I put in the most effort I could and I still fail  was I lazy since I did not put in more or am I plain inadequate?,btohqsg
why's bro having a debate rn.  inadequate  no one is perfect  we'll always have some strengths and weaknesses. but imo  if  you're constantly failing  then maybe it's not the effort that affects your grade but your studying technique. some subjects/topic require a different approach. based on my experience  let's say i practise chemistry. learning about the blast furnace is all about memorising  so I make flash cards for those chapters. on the other hand there's chapters like moles which require calculations  so I'll have to do more practises in order to excel in that topic. so maybe it's the studying method that holds you back.,btohqsg
wah scare me I tot u talking to who,btohqsg
A levels causing him to hallucinate,btohqsg
YA THATS WHY I GOT SCARED,btohqsg
Yee  gotta see the bigger picture beyond my fears!,btohqsg

@Corporate_shillremind me why is NTU so far,btohqsg
I ask myself that every week when i go home too,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone have resources for biology IA?,btohqsg
Do you think students should wear school uniform,btohqsg
I feel that they should be abolished cos school uniform for girls are extremely sexualised,btohqsg
i think its a good thing bcs it reduces class divisions in the classroom,btohqsg
like u shd be going to sch to receive an education not to be a competition of who has the latest  most trendiest clothes,btohqsg
and obv since not everyone is able to afford nice clothes  its gonna lead to bullying and stuff,btohqsg
i feel like maybe we can have gender neutral uniforms? that would solve some problems,btohqsg
For real I hate wearing skirts,btohqsg
ITS SO HOT AND STUFFY EH,btohqsg
Ok la the pe attire pog,btohqsg
its like some kind of waterproof material,btohqsg
PLS there's alw this patch of sweat at end of the day damn gross,btohqsg
it doesnt seem to absorb liquids that well,btohqsg
the sweat stain would be there tho,btohqsg
yeah the sweat stain alone is gross imo,btohqsg
doesn't matter if got febreeze idt the sight of the stain alone is appealing to much of the public,btohqsg
but srsly tho sg weather.... cant help it sia,btohqsg
We would start calling 20 deg weather a heatwave and people would have heatstroke,btohqsg
Unless you got dem juicy back muscles,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs why Uniform is bad,btohqsg
But some uniform looks really smart.,btohqsg
I thought you referring to ns,btohqsg
rly reminds me of christmas snacks,btohqsg
like begging ppl to buy stuff,btohqsg
Like they check your tickets and stuff,btohqsg
Should have a cooling material in it?,btohqsg
GUYS I FOUND MY RIGHT AIRPOD,btohqsg
oh ya do u still need help with math,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not just talking for Singapore uniform lol,btohqsg
Are you a guy for female,btohqsg
airy but usually girls wear shorts inside,btohqsg
i see some of my guy freinds,btohqsg
wear pe shorts under long pants,btohqsg
bcs they are too lazy to change,btohqsg
A dude just asked me why do girls wear shorts underneath their skirt ü§°,btohqsg
most of us dont actually feel it being airy so,btohqsg
If I don‚Äôt wear shorts I won‚Äôt feel comfy,btohqsg
lend him a skirt to wear and ask if he can feel his birdie flying in the wind,btohqsg
Neutral about this. I feel that options should be available e.g. Allow wearing of tudung  allow choice of skirt or pants.,btohqsg
the current one is so bad,btohqsg
Different school different budget different material bahc,btohqsg
When I was in pri school  the material damn cheapo and thin for girls blouse,btohqsg
but isn't it the students who pay for it?,btohqsg
they can rly just make drifit/cotton shirts,btohqsg
I mean I still feel uniform is good for most students mainly bcs of class distinctions and sense of unity,btohqsg
My sec school's uniform material is quite high quality. My mum used to work in garment industry.,btohqsg
13 per set but this was 2010 ish,btohqsg
yes even saf no. 4 is more comfi than sch uni,btohqsg
The blouse at the chest portion tears easily coz there's a hole there that's covered by the school tie,btohqsg
Then if you wear and wash many times  the blouse thin until can see the inner wear,btohqsg
idk i feel like polyester not good clothing material,btohqsg
The skirt very soft and comfy but the blouse material was horrible,btohqsg
At least in sec school the material was much better,btohqsg
oh yah dunman high can wear any sch shirt,btohqsg
But more hot lah coz thicker,btohqsg
by right ITE allow girls to wear pants also,btohqsg
