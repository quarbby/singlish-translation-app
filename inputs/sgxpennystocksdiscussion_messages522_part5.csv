Pika World Update- 2 September 2021Hotcake ReleaseOne of Pika World favourites  ChargePoint  is on the rise again after its latest second quarter sales report release. While the loss per share was wider than expected  earnings do not matter as much for a company growing aggressively.To much surprise  the sales beat expectation  and there is rosy guidance of about $60-$65 million in sales for the third quarter  much higher than analysts $55 million expectation.This is indeed a great quarter despite many negative performances from the auto industry. For example  if we recall  GM had a dull forecast for its 2H2021 earnings and other EV related small caps stock prices have also tumbled over the past 3 months.Job Report Shows WeaknessIt seems like Covid 19 effect is roaring back again as private sector employment continues to disappoint. In addition  the Delta variant appears to have hurt the hiring process. Thus  this is a weak shift towards recovery from the labour market after a robust private hiring process in the first half of 2021.Pika World believes that beyond Covid 19 variant  a mix of other factors such as supply chain problems also offers an uneven recovery process  and such a trend may persist. Also  the labour market appears to be on a tight note  given that companies are also facing difficulty finding people to fill up the vacancy.Chinese EV CompaniesNio and XPeng appeared to disappoint investors as their deliveries figures are underwhelming. But  of course  they had long blamed the semiconductor shortage  which is hurting production.Nonetheless  NIO's guidance for September hints at a possible bounce back to normalcy as it expects to deliver around 9000 vehicles.Li Auto had an excellent record delivery compared to its peers. It delivered 8433 vehicles that are an increase from 8589 vehicles in July. This marks the second consecutive month where we saw Li Auto delivering more vehicles than Nio and XPeng.Pika World remains constructive on Chinese EV sectors while also mindful of a continuous corporate crackdown in China  and the sector is not immune to possible adverse impact or sentiments.Alphabet: Walking in the Shadow of Apple?The company aims to use its computer chips for its laptop and tablet computers range  which is expected to help it reduce reliance on external parties for semiconductors. If this is true  then the company appears to walk into the path of Apple  which had also used internal chips instead of those produced by Intel for their Mac computers and laptops.In particular  we have seen robust performance in Alphabet share price as the company seems to move back into hardware devices as it may build chips for Pixel smartphones. It will not be surprising as many Big Tech are developing their chip-making capabilities. In addition  we have seen how Amazon  Facebook and even Tesla work on personal chips for internal consumption of their products  ranging from data centres to electronic items and even cars.What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims  which is expected to hover around 345K  almost similar to 353K in the prior period.When the clock hit 10 pm  the Factory orders are expected to increase by 0.3%  a moderation from 1.5% in the prior period.From 1 is to 3 am  we see FOMC members speaking  such as Bostic and Daly  which may hint at a possible tapering schedule.It is 2 September  Wednesday  7.35 am in Singapore and 7.35 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends an energetic week ahead!,btohqsg
