Can tell people their COE depre 15k per year,btohqsg
ya coz the lowest price bid that strike whole quota will be the final rpice,btohqsg
It’s a tactic. Raise COE sky high then drop back to a range that is still considered high  but ppl will think it’s a steal lol,btohqsg
next round i also bid cat b,btohqsg
i submit $60k try my luck,btohqsg
3 mins ago cat b less than cat A,btohqsg
i tot system siao liao sekali......,btohqsg
Just need drop back to 50 60k,btohqsg
Then I straightaway renew PQP le,btohqsg
Very very hard and pqp is an average so need a consistent drop over a few rounds which is harder,btohqsg
Lol yah we can only pray,btohqsg
More work is needed on those dealers  best is shorten the holding period to 5 days,btohqsg
just proves our theories werent wrong,btohqsg
to have 1/4 of cars for PHV per bidding is alot also,btohqsg
Cat A $95Cat B $110Though drop  but still expensive,btohqsg
Maybe near election better  they will allocate more COE to increase the supply,btohqsg
Then when all happy buy already and election over  they introduce erp 2.0,btohqsg
got some ppl say must crash,btohqsg
Dealer will still push for hybrid to be sold asap. The rebate of 20k going to be only 5k next year onwards,btohqsg
If no sell hard to clear stock,btohqsg
Remember the motorbike cat  dropped in 1st round  shot up next. Due to e bike sharing company,btohqsg
Cat B drops a lot sia,btohqsg
