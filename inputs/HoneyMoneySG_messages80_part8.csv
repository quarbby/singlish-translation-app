I checked the mcc using digibot haha but I‚Äôm worried ICAEW is treated as an educational institution hence no miles awarded :/,btohqsg
Hi  I subscribe to moomoo to get the 30 days 5.8 percent interest. But y I don't see the daily return?,btohqsg
SRS top up for tax relief - top up on 31 dec eligible for relief? Or must be last business day of the month,btohqsg
Wait for 3 or 4 days later. Need time to pass your fund to fund manager.,btohqsg
Must I subscribe to smartsave? Iis smart save and the 5.8 interest entirely two different things?,btohqsg
Two different things.Did you click the 5.8% button before you deposit the fund into your account ?,btohqsg
Hi all  can i ask something related to HDB loan?If the couple has HLE approved during BTO application (below 14k)  but when during key collection (after 4-5 years) the total income exceeds the 14k limit.Are the couple still eligible to obtain HDB loan? or cannot liao  coz exceed 14k during key collection?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for best savings account. Which is better- UOB one or OCBC 360? Am thinking if I should switch from OCBC to UOB,btohqsg
U can try to see if the tiered interest in UOB suits u. Otherwise OCBC is good too. Check out the website,btohqsg
For 80k moomoo 5.8%  can we withdraw the daily interest? Like in every week?,btohqsg
Hi Finance Gurus  can I check if Trust credit card will count towards the 5 card spend we have to do monthly to get that extra 0.5%-1% extra interest on our trust savings account. Or only debit card can?,btohqsg
both CC and debit should count,btohqsg
uob one but must clock min $500 card spend,btohqsg
both are good. put 100k in each. for ocbc you need to increase 500 every month so at some point you will want to reset back to 100k,btohqsg
Ok  I think I stick to OCBC then. Like not very big diff,btohqsg
The big difference is can you spend $500 every month  is your saving hit $100k. It is by tier. Depends on the tier you have  the interest received may difference.,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î but has the $500 be certain category? I‚Äôm using Citi rewards for most transactions,btohqsg
Yes. On UOB one. You only get 0.05% per year if you did not spend on uob eligible card whereas OCBC you still can get higher interest.Eg. Earn $50 interest per year with $100k saving on UOB One account without credit card spend.I strongly recommend you read the info on both bank websites to understand both products.,btohqsg
For standard chartered smart card  how long does it take for fast transaction payment to clear the statement usually take?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd recommend using EVOL with the UOB account. It‚Äôs more generous with cashback compared to the One card. As for the UOB Savings Acc minimum of 500  I don‚Äôt think the list of exclusions are very high. You might wish to check the T&C but the app is good about telling you exactly when you‚Äôve hit the 500 and so you can switch to other cards then.,btohqsg
Any1 used the Maybank Horizon Visa with AXS for SInglife Insurance? Will it get the 0.24 mpd since using AXS?,btohqsg
Is putting everything in uob one account rather than fix deposit or buying reits or stocks now in this economic climate a good strategy if you use more than 500 in a valid uob card with salary crediting?,btohqsg
bonus interest max for $100k average daily balance for the month,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  does scb simplycash creditcard earn cashback for bus/train via simplygo?,btohqsg
Ya but if most of the time won't hit 100k? So far I have been using excess to pay off home loans etc so I doubt will hit 100k anytime soon,btohqsg
for evol card do you still need shop only at certain group to get cashback? can still get cashback if u spend groceries at sheng siong? min spending must be $600 right?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt remember the specifics. But I usually get around $40 back from it every month. I‚Äôm not very mindful of where I spend. I just stop whenever I realise that I‚Äôve hit 600ish,btohqsg
Where has NETSPay QR code to scan for payment?,btohqsg
hi guys  thinking of applying for my first cc but going through all of Chris' YT videos and comparing is abit draining  what are the best for beginners?seems to me that citi rewards + amaze is still one of the best to start with? was thinking of pairing that with the SC smart credit card.,btohqsg
Cashback limit at $250 spending online and $250 spending mobile contactless. $100 more on any eligible spending to hit $600.,btohqsg
Most places with NETS machine can generate NETS QR.,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. Break it down to individual transactions and how much do you spend on them monthly.,btohqsg
i would say majority is food  in a mix of cash and card  and drinks that i pay via paynow to friend that paid,btohqsg
do CCs count in drinks as qualifying spend for miles/cashback/points?,btohqsg
And what spending range would that be? If it is higher can consider Uob cards with higher ceiling limit .. VS   lady card,btohqsg
About 900-1.3k per month  which is why I'm unsure about cards with minimum spend,btohqsg
anyone have standard chartered credit card? how long does FAST bill payment take to reflect?,btohqsg
Try out Citi card  rewards or cashback it is pretty easy to use. Those with online and physical payment need some monitoring. There are many videos u can watch on YouTube HMSG,btohqsg
Citi rewards? Yup have been watching his videos but there are too many too go through  and some are not up to date due to policy changes,btohqsg
@Eitaroif you want to go easy and lazy mode  this is a good video from Chris.https://youtu.be/oGOzl0RnR9w?si=l0Vu2e0r6DGJRUW3Unlimited cashback cards.,btohqsg
CC need some effort la otherwise just do 1.5-1.7% low return cards lo,btohqsg
Reading tnc and monitoring is part of the journey,btohqsg
Unless you actually breakdown all the spending to individual transactions  the only recommendation is low unlimited cashback cards,btohqsg
It has to be manually refreshed with 2FA (OTP  digital token) to ensure the security of your data on the app.,btohqsg
Ah then nothing special  same as all other apps using the same Salt Edge kind of solution ü•≤ got excited for a moment there,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚Äú999‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Dobin does use third party aggregators too but the key differences are1. It‚Äôs completelyfree  regardless of the number of accounts you connect i.e. you can connect all 8 banks for free2. We auto-categorise your transactions to avoid manual input.In addition to real-time data  is there anything you‚Äôre particularly looking for?,btohqsg
Any promo code for new sign up for HSBC EGA account ?,btohqsg
