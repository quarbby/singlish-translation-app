I mean if u dont wanna listen,btohqsg
There's a reason why many contractors are malaysians,btohqsg
Yes they do it and sua,btohqsg
Malaysians tend to have better workmanship,btohqsg
But that's not to say singapore dont have,btohqsg
U have a different experience than me,btohqsg
Both sg and my have their share of hard worker and lazy asses,btohqsg
And if u go malaysia's workshop. It doesnt help that our currency is stronger,btohqsg
But a person who leave their country to work already pass a certain level of drive already,btohqsg
One example i gonna quote from example.,btohqsg
Anyway i thought u were talking about cars,btohqsg
U try find a singaporean to tune your car or custom fabricate a part.,btohqsg
Didnt realize it was just a broad based anti nationalistic sentiment,btohqsg
Why would anyone learn that skill here,btohqsg
Thats like an eskimo learning to build a fridge,btohqsg
‚ÄúI know how to engine swap a car  but its illegal in my country‚Äù,btohqsg
Idk why so many tuners are there in sg then,btohqsg
U are kind to call them tuners,btohqsg
I hope u not referring to those maps that can be bought,btohqsg
There  u get my drift now,btohqsg
"U pay 2 to 3k for a ""tune""",btohqsg
U go malaysia pay 3k RM,btohqsg
Now your turn to listen my pov ah,btohqsg
They give you a much better tune with road tests,btohqsg
Ok so maybe passionate is not the right word then,btohqsg
Thats because they have a market bro,btohqsg
Learning the skill  setting up the shop and training a crew,btohqsg
U do it in singapore then who are your customers,btohqsg
I tell u what sgean passionate about la,btohqsg
Posting speeding car on fb and watch them kena arrested,btohqsg
They machiam fapping while watching the car tow,btohqsg
I'll just rephrase my sentence  I find malaysian workshops have better workmanship than in singapore because they give more shit than many workshops in singapore,btohqsg
Put it this way most of the shit u do in msia u come back here have to dekit before inspection,btohqsg
Hard truths: Most of our mechanics in SG are from Msia.,btohqsg
Some of them cant even be arsed,btohqsg
Nv find just say cannot find,btohqsg
This kind of shit u wont see in malaysia,btohqsg
And i've backed it up with because our currency stronger,btohqsg
I dont have your problem at all,btohqsg
Workshops i trust only a few,btohqsg
More expensive  yes. Lazy and cannot be arsed  no,btohqsg
limbeh still half past 6 ded,btohqsg
I think every workshop will have people not a fan of one ba. Which is why i have bad experiences at workshops people worship like god like that,btohqsg
