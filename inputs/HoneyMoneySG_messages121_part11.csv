Any pros and cons insurance savings plan vs ssb?,btohqsg
No one's stopping you from talking  just say things that are factual and relevant to the topic,btohqsg
Insurance savings plan has very low returnsThe first two years premium goes to paying commission ... So ... GG,btohqsg
The agent telling me normally around 3+% pa,btohqsg
You get way better returns outside of endowments. And are equally  if not safer.,btohqsg
That’s what they tell you  but to actually break even  takes quite a while,btohqsg
Not really.  Previously if you buy traditional ntuc saving plan . You can get good return up to 5%. Until recently MAS put a cap on return yield of 4.8%,btohqsg
"So right now is it previously or now? And I'm pretty sure you meant ""projected"" and not guaranteed.",btohqsg
If u go around and ask ... I don't think anyone has achieved that ... likely is around 2-3%,btohqsg
No one will look at the up to %. Everywhere can state up to how many % but if it can’t reach what’s the point.,btohqsg
Now is just average. I bought a retired plan manulife as back up .. if my stocks fail... I almost fail as my stock raffles medical keep going down to 1.0,btohqsg
Does it means ssb better than insurance savings plan?,btohqsg
Let ssb do your money growing....Do look at tBills..... ssb .... reits.... Stocks...,btohqsg

Oh. For that 1% Cashback uh?,btohqsg
Get your agent to send you the BI  look at your premiums paid and the GUARANTEED column. See how long it takes for you to break even.Factor in that you need to pay continuously and if you early surrender you usually won’t get back what you put in.PS  not a financial advise. Do your own due diligence,btohqsg
