Audi hard to sell in SG. Ppl in SG want shouty looks .. audi design very understated. Dependent on individual preferences.,btohqsg
Problem is people rather buy BMW for the same price as audi,btohqsg
üòÄ ya some ppl told me that too haha,btohqsg
ya. some ppl also prefer the mercedes over the audi. most of the time is this. Mercedes designs for their exteriors and cabins are super beautiful!,btohqsg
but tbh.. next car.. i‚Äôll not get a luxury marque anymore.. imo  could used the money for something else.,btohqsg
No one is talking about the accord hor?,btohqsg
And pay honda tax ah... siao,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admineh you‚Äôll never review the Accord ah?!,btohqsg
"Most buy Merc because ""class"" ""10 year warranty""",btohqsg
And the c160 and a180s exist,btohqsg
Younger gen all love rgb lights.. give them RGB lighting that sync with their tiktok vids huge sales,btohqsg
The main thing Mercedes has going for them is the interior,btohqsg
So many see it as a win to be able to have an interior similar to an s or e class at the a class level,btohqsg
wahh brooo. Mercedes ambient lights quite distracting for me sia. especially the ones at the dashboard,btohqsg
I love the tech man. And simple look.,btohqsg
Hence A5 is my preferred option,btohqsg
‚úåüèª Get the car you truly love. Not to satisfy others  but for yourself only.,btohqsg
Just a bit sad that it doenst have blind spot monitor,btohqsg
Also audi is same mqb platform as VW  you're paying extra for the 4 rings,btohqsg
ppl buy Mercedes is because 8 to 80 yo know marcelli,btohqsg
In SG  tasted one time of owning a luxury marque car good enough for me le.,btohqsg
Then i really know.. i should use the money for a non-luxury brand-luxury sedan/suv,btohqsg
I agree  i experienced 1 year of bmw warranty service  actually nothing much haha,btohqsg
Like camry  accord  mazda 6/Harrier  CX-9.. etc.,btohqsg
üÖ±Ô∏èOLüÖ±Ô∏èO make very simplistic sleek interior with the perfect mix of gloss and matte for me. Most settings are controlled via the 9 inch potrait screen so it creates quite a clean finish.Also  scandinavian woohoo,btohqsg
not bad.. u got taste for scandinavian designs ‚úåüèª,btohqsg
haha yes  been many years and i still love them,btohqsg
subaru is the perfect mix of brash and cheap for me,btohqsg
He likes swedish cars like how we like our swedish meatballs,btohqsg
Actually  swedish meatballs are turkish.. just like volvo is actually... chinese...,btohqsg
It's cheap until it decides to jibaboom,btohqsg
That's where the brash comes in,btohqsg
the brash is the ride quality also,btohqsg
but no complaints cos this slow wagon handles better then some conti cars i‚Äôve had,btohqsg
Beyond sticker shock: Running costs first-time car owners must considerBuying your first car? Don't just calculate the down payment and monthly instalments. Here are the other costs you must also factor in!üëâüèª React with üò± if you agree owning a car in Singapore isEXPENSIVE!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
NEVER ‚Ä¶ EVER.. buy a new car from the showroom.,btohqsg
Buy almost new. Don‚Äôt buy new.,btohqsg
I think you have to justify why thoü§î-R,btohqsg
Depreciation .. Depreciation .. Once you roll out of the showroom  depreciation kicks in. For every owner  the FIRST owner suffers from the depreciation the most.,btohqsg
If nobody buy new where got almost new eh?,btohqsg
current car hasnt had any depreciation on the car,btohqsg
u see those teslas too  still earning,btohqsg
Ownself know can liao.. that's why most of us here use sgcm buy used cars ü§≠,btohqsg
naohiaaaa with the current coe u mean hahahha,btohqsg
some ppl legit prefer a new car from the showroom. that‚Äôs up to them.,btohqsg
imo  a smart car buyer.. will buy almost new.,btohqsg
I buy used car and put new car flavor air freshener - tadaaaa,btohqsg
and don‚Äôt buy first batch too.,btohqsg
cash and carry la. first time buyer should not used HP. No money ask mama,btohqsg
yup! From what I know  most people buy brand new car for that piece of mind-R,btohqsg
