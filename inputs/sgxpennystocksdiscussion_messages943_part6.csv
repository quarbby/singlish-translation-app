🚀Pika World Breakfast Update - 21 June 2024🚀Volatility is back as we approach the quadruple witching day. While major indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back from their record highs  the laggard Dow Jones powered ahead  rising more than 0.8%. This comes as investors digest a string of economic data.💼Job Data and Home Construction🔒The US jobless claims saw a modest decline but are still higher than expected  reflecting evidence of further cooling in the labour market.New home construction also dropped 5.5% in May  and the previous April reading was revised lower  cementing the ongoing idea of a slowdown in economic activity.🍣Good news on inflation🗽The Council of Economic Advisers also released some positive news on inflation. With solid wage growth and a slower climb in grocery prices  Americans have firmer purchasing power.In perspective  while grocery prices rose by 1% annually  average hourly earnings rose by 4.1%. An exciting calculation is that an American will take around 3.6 hours of work to buy a basket of grocery staples compared to 3.7 hours in May last year.📪What's on the menu today?📤1) At 9.45 pm.  we will have S&P 500 Global Services PMI for May.2) At 10 pm  we will have Existing Home Sales data.It is 21 June  Friday at 8.50 am in Singapore and 8.50 pm in New York. What a cooling and rainy morning in Singapore. We hope all friends have a delightful and chill day as we move to the week's last trading day.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg

Crude Oily🛢️ WTI TA daily📈 4ref.,btohqsg
Crude Oily🛢️ WTI futures held above $81 per barrel on Friday and were up more than 3% so far this week  on track for a second straight weekly advance as falling US crude inventories and an escalating conflict in the Middle East bolstered oil prices. Data released on Thursday showed that US crude stockpiles declined by 2.547 million barrels last week  exceeding forecasts for a 2 million barrel draw. US gasoline and distillate stocks also experienced surprise drawdowns  indicating robust energy demand. In the Middle East  Israeli forces advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip city of Rafah  raising geopolitical tensions in the region that could disrupt oil flows. Elsewhere  expectations that major central banks will deliver multiple interest rate cuts this year boosted the outlook  with the ECB  SNB and BOC already underway in their easing cycle.,btohqsg
