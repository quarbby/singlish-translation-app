So he got a paycut doing so,btohqsg
sian imagine if he say instructions,btohqsg
omg i still rmb one tracher was a pe+health education teacher but was fat af and was damn shit,btohqsg
is like can bully kids kind,btohqsg
Im trying to see if i can do my professional internship in a tuition centre,btohqsg
I heard its hard to arrange such a thing but,btohqsg
got one person do intern at gan eng seng i think,btohqsg
I don't even think your school will approve that,btohqsg
Dude my math senior is doing it now in an actual tuition centre,btohqsg
You do stuff like develop syllabus for subjects,btohqsg
Pretty sure u need a teaching license for that,btohqsg
Man is the kind that can do syllabus and textbooks,btohqsg
Actually yeah maybe you have to teach first before moving there,btohqsg
The Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) of the Ministry of Education provides support for curricula for Primary and Secondary levels in a range of subject areas.The Curriculum Development ProcessIn a broad sense  the curriculum development process includes the design  development  implementation and evaluation of curricula. However  as one examines the process more closely it becomes evident that each component may itself comprise several varied but inter-related activities. The Curriculum Development is charged with the responsibility to operationalise the Curriculum Development Process. Accordingly  the work of the division may be more adequately described as designing  developing  implementing  monitoring  evaluating and reviewing curricula that are appropriate and relevant to the needs and interests of a developing nation  such as ours.,btohqsg
Basically MOE I don't think u can avoid the PDGE lmao,btohqsg
Everything requires that as a professional cert to start.,btohqsg
Just get the pdge  teach for a few years and request for a transfer to cpdd (if that works),btohqsg
I think one of my sec sch Econs chers moved to moe cpdd,btohqsg
Can also do masters then get pdge,btohqsg
so like...i cannot just get a masters and enter there?,btohqsg
Most do the other way round,btohqsg
Because PDGE is lower than masters in terms of rigour,btohqsg
I tot it was post graduate diploma in education,btohqsg
I heard something like if you teach first and do your masters later you may not get the pay increment,btohqsg
So better to do masters first rather than after you start teaching,btohqsg
Yep u get fast tracked in the educator route,btohqsg
Oh my sec sch Econs Cher said that,btohqsg
a lot of times MOE will even sponsor your masters,btohqsg
source: my friend in PGDE rn and my prof that did his PhD while under MOE,btohqsg
If u good enough MOE might sponsor your masters,btohqsg
Her pay raise got delayed after she completed her masters after she started teaching,btohqsg
Na that one is skill issue,btohqsg
Maybe thatâ€™s why the salary raise is delayed?,btohqsg
actually what if i just was the person to create the resources,btohqsg
Doesn't matter tho because when u do masters that way it still counts under your years as an educator in MOE,btohqsg
Your benefits will continue with the years being helpful for your pension plan,btohqsg
you know the surprising part is i found out i can do an fyp about physics education lol,btohqsg
if a prof allowed that is,btohqsg
U need a physics prof to sign off on it,btohqsg
Which is why I said previously that I applied for transfer to double major,btohqsg
Cuz doing so means i can get either a philo or history prof to sign off on it,btohqsg
tbh  it has been done before when i was reading like other ppl fyp thesis,btohqsg
U just need to find a prof to sucker in,btohqsg
some profs literally have physics education as part of their research focus,btohqsg
Double major means the amount of Profs I can choose from is wider,btohqsg
like one of the areas they work in,btohqsg
i can think of 2-3 off the top of my head,btohqsg
Depends also if it aligns with their interest too,btohqsg
the only person i can think of...,btohqsg
I know NTU tries to choose Profs of different sub fields,btohqsg
