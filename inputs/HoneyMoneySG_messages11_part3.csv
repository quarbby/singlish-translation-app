hey guys  so in order to catch this last month of Revolut cashback i just top up 300 by debit/bank then just withdraw 250 immediately after? it‚Äôs capped at $10 CB so 50 max right?,btohqsg
Yes this is what I have been doing for the past few months and it works. But like what others have suggested  you may want to withdraw the $250 a few days later instead of immediately so you don‚Äôt get flagged or banned,btohqsg
