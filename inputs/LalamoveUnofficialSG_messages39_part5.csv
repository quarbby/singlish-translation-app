the video is üí™üèº. People don‚Äôt think much of us delivery drivers. Just take the parcels from us and close door in our faces. Very rarely will the recipient appreciate the delivery driver. Rain or shine we are always there. Just to send them their creature comforts. Relegated to being second- or third-class citizens. Salute to all delivery drivers.,btohqsg
