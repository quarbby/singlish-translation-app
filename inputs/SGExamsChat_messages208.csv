They shd at least show which range u are in,btohqsg
Then u have to ask around alr,btohqsg
Yeah i heard some schools used to do like 20-40%,btohqsg
they removed it entirely i think,btohqsg
mine just shows the 5 letters lol,btohqsg
Your report slip will just show your marks,btohqsg
mine doesnt even show the mark ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Guys how do u improve for amath,btohqsg
deadass 5 letters and conduct grade,btohqsg
Yeah it's Abit late if I'm s4 lmao,btohqsg
Haha you wonâ€™t be asking this if youâ€™re in sec 4,btohqsg
Lmao yah was thinking o lvls over alrdy,btohqsg
yeet i think they changed it from my yr onwards,btohqsg
its ok  not like it matters,btohqsg
A math legit they always give the same qns,btohqsg
i see top tier JC ppl gettin rekted on bell curves,btohqsg
Get used tl the qn types easy A,btohqsg
Is there a good assessment book for a math,btohqsg
I thought there was no bellcurve at a levels,btohqsg
im not referrin to a lvls lol,btohqsg
I used other sch prelim papers btr,btohqsg
How do yâ€™all even get practice papers in JC,btohqsg
Its called grade boundaries they just dw call it bell curve,btohqsg
when thereâ€™s so few schools to source from,btohqsg
Its not a fixed % of stusents get each grade,btohqsg
For chem itâ€™s topical revision packages,btohqsg
Only have maybe 10 single digit JCs,btohqsg
this is good for getting basics ah,btohqsg
Yeah it isnt but when people say bell curve they udually refer to the changing of grades,btohqsg
not like u can finish all also,btohqsg
so no point having all/so many,btohqsg
Unlike secondary school where there are literally so many schools to take papers from,btohqsg
but if youâ€™re looking at A / >80 shinglee books r good,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m sure most people would finish more than 10 schools papers before a levels,btohqsg
Doesn't mean they aren't single digit means you don't practice them...Otherwise what papers do RJC and HCJC students practise?,btohqsg
but for me i can ah  my frens mostly couldn't,btohqsg
lol sec sch prelim papers... i barely did any before my o lvls,btohqsg
maybe thats why i didnt do well for o lvls,btohqsg
Hmm ip hard ah.. must ask your friends.. quite restricted,btohqsg
Some of them canâ€™t even show their friends,btohqsg
IP dont they teach some jc stuff in advance,btohqsg
year 3 already learnt chem equilibria,btohqsg
90 RP is way more impressive than 6 points,btohqsg
Lol my senior is depressed in EJC,btohqsg
i have rvhs students so i know,btohqsg
Yea... Thmmin JC they count everything sia,btohqsg
God hope my pw can get A to keep my 90rp dream alive,btohqsg
Hwa Chong sec 3 chem topics except acid base equilibrium,btohqsg
have no friends because heâ€™s like the only neighbourhood school student,btohqsg
is quite watered down tho no? sec sch chem equilibria,btohqsg
If Amath not good can use Chinese as L1R5,btohqsg
Damn maybe i was lucky i didnt go to ejc,btohqsg
i had 2 PW projects for uni this week,btohqsg
dk if can even get A or not,btohqsg
at most data based. But havent appear yet,btohqsg
fun fact  all chem equations are actually equilibria,btohqsg
sadly no one knows the truth until u take a chem mod in uni,btohqsg
I got 46 for amath eoy lol,btohqsg
They dont just look at grade rught,btohqsg
And my portfolio is almost empty,btohqsg
see which faculty u go lor,btohqsg
then maybe u shld start w casco,btohqsg
if engineering 85 rp enough le,btohqsg
GOD IM SCREWED IF I DONT GET A FOR PW,btohqsg
did u mess up ur op,btohqsg
I wonder if Hwa Chong sec ip students learn jc organic chem,btohqsg
NTU scholarships I think 85RP is sufficient,btohqsg
Naw Cosco sounds kinda pussy ngl,btohqsg
my fren HCI  4H2 distinctions  taekwondo gold in NUS FASS  no scholarship for 88.75rp,btohqsg
US is really tough. They want an amazing portfolio,btohqsg
Idk how to define mess up,btohqsg
My presentation was under 4 mins,btohqsg
I wouldnâ€™t mind working for a US company for a couple of years,btohqsg
good to get your basics down ah suddenly go face lvl 100 boss abit the unrealistic,btohqsg
I recently sign up for Astar scholarship  my RP is like 70+  and my friend got near 85 RP,btohqsg
tough part is interview  easy part is studyin,btohqsg
But I heard that itâ€™s mainly SAT,btohqsg
My rtq i did stutter a bit while thinkingbut i think i got my poont across,btohqsg
That's the hard part. 90 RP in comparison is nothing,btohqsg
And I got into interview but not him,btohqsg
Then tmr i submitting I AND R,btohqsg
they will wait for ur A lvl results,btohqsg
my tutor said >3.5 min can liao,btohqsg
It's some science lab in Singapore,btohqsg
and she said keep under 4.5,btohqsg
But how are CCAs so difficult,btohqsg
I heard sat math easy as hell,btohqsg
They want an all rounder. Not just someone who scores well. They want good at everything,btohqsg
Sec 2 student can do or smtg,btohqsg
i rmb i made the examiner repeat his qn and i think for 30 seconds and rap until he sound the bell,btohqsg
Ya but CCAs are easier than 90RP?,btohqsg
op given 5 min dunnid use full thing wud,btohqsg
Unless if they want like olympians or something,btohqsg
Not just CCAs. They want to see high position and leadership roles,btohqsg
cca commitments isnt easy imo tbh,btohqsg
Plus volunteer work and all that,btohqsg
If I join a solo CCA,btohqsg
Any murican unis focus on grades primarily?,btohqsg
Ezco only can have let's say 5,btohqsg
but if u only aiming for local unis,btohqsg
Idh any leadership position also haha,btohqsg
uh UK looks mainly at grades,btohqsg
i can tell u  cca no need exco also can get scholarship,btohqsg
US top schs more or less all want u to be some talented shiz,btohqsg
My sch you need 5 min members for cca,btohqsg
Local unis are nothing in comparison to US,btohqsg
Ya like what if your the top performer in your CCA,btohqsg
Can you still get scholarship to USA?,btohqsg
Anger  are u some top player in smt,btohqsg
i mean i dont even care abt overseas cos im a poor farmer,btohqsg
prob is is not so easy,btohqsg
I think too many factors to say so right,btohqsg
You can make it up by being 90rp or smtg,btohqsg
tbh you should look at what course you want some courses are better done in sg if u wanna work in sg,btohqsg
overseas unis are a waste of money,btohqsg
Well  regardless  don't forget your 90 RP. Oh yes  remember that they look at your school grades as well,btohqsg
I donâ€™t want to work in SG,btohqsg
Cs where is ideal to do,btohqsg
as i quote someone from cambridge who used to be active here,btohqsg
nt too sure lol i dun rly keep up w cs but the doods in my batch are aiming overseas :â€™),btohqsg
And many go into local universities for medicine or law,btohqsg
he transferred from nus to cambridge i think,btohqsg
Isnt it like 75% of hci get 90rp,btohqsg
So I daresay acceptance is relatively high,btohqsg
Yijc i heard got 0 last year,btohqsg
9 students got 90rp or so i heard,btohqsg
RI always dominates the % of 90 RPers,btohqsg
RI and Hwa Chong have like 25% annually,btohqsg
Wait so rj and hci whats their 90rp rate,btohqsg
400 from each sch + 400 from JAE,btohqsg
Damn is my sch small in compatieon,btohqsg
My cohort got about 700+ students,btohqsg
are u gonna study chem next time  given ur username?,btohqsg
But RI people prefer local universities from my knowledge,btohqsg
Mostly ACIB people that go overseas,btohqsg
chem be the bane of my existence,btohqsg
must be a curse to see so many RI ppl in my course,btohqsg
Oh was it white face or black face or smtg,btohqsg
when am i gonna get my wagyu treat,btohqsg
Because I heard you need to be like,btohqsg
Top 10 students in the whole cohort,btohqsg
I will get 87.5 at best,btohqsg
Only got like 8 in RI,btohqsg
as long as u work hard  can alr,btohqsg
i also estimated my rp around urs,btohqsg
Bro  the econs today was a disaster,btohqsg
in the end i chua tiu,btohqsg
my a lvl econs also nvr finish,btohqsg
But I may get 7-8 Distinction hehe,btohqsg
U get 8 dist max 87.6 meh hw can hahaha,btohqsg
How do u guys get super fucking op in chem,btohqsg
game theory is basically h3 econs,btohqsg
I just wanna be that kid in class who gets 90 for exams,btohqsg
That struggle to qualify for university,btohqsg
bedok is on his way to double h3,btohqsg
How is smu in comparison to the 2 Ns,btohqsg
In the end  it doesn't really matter. Unless you are the recipient of some very good scholorship,btohqsg
Bedok you want to take two H3s??,btohqsg
in my eyes if u study hard and can get a scholarship (whether bond-free/bonded) is alr good,btohqsg
Yeah sciences are really adamant on keywords,btohqsg
How do i study for it lol,btohqsg
all my 90 rper friends got a scholarship,btohqsg
If i have trash portfolio but 90rp is it guaranteed,btohqsg
They won't allow double H3 in Year 2,btohqsg
Actl can someone who scored a 6 for 0s just go out and answer my questions,btohqsg
if u not aiming bonded scholarships  yes,btohqsg
U have to take one in Year 1 and one in Year 2,btohqsg
Why would you want a trash portfolio,btohqsg
apply for local unis shld be ok if u dont screw ur interview,btohqsg
So like nus and ntu scholatship type,btohqsg
My senior say last success was like 2014,btohqsg
bedok is on his way to double h3 :D,btohqsg
Means u exceed the 13 AU,btohqsg
I mean work is guaranteed but like,btohqsg
i prefer not to be bonded,btohqsg
Actually Bedok which school are you on,btohqsg
some bonded ppl regret cos they see their non-bonded frens offered a 10k/month job they tilt,btohqsg
U must get like near 90 in year 1 if u want Ur appeal to be considered,btohqsg
That's what my senior told me,btohqsg
10k a moth right out of university,btohqsg
its banking if u are wondering,btohqsg
Will select the people in the cohort,btohqsg
I apply h3 math i didnt get in,btohqsg
i think this yr they offered to some people with gp B,btohqsg
That are considered to have scholarship potential,btohqsg
Apparently no one got in h3 math,btohqsg
grooming happens way before jc starts,btohqsg
They dw show us the paper we took,btohqsg
but its cos their other subs dam lit ah,btohqsg
some jcs have an inhouse scholarship program,btohqsg
that selects ppl based on o lvl l1r5,btohqsg
but scholarship selection is based on j2 results performance,btohqsg
so even if u are in the scholar program  but u suck at j2 exams  u wont be selected to apply for uni scholarships,btohqsg
I got invited for USP   shld I apply,btohqsg
Im kinda in one they just tell you if got nice events to go for to boost your chances,btohqsg
So you can still apply  just not through the JC?,btohqsg
Idk what theyll do in year 2,btohqsg
No choice  u have to ask around. Form this buddyship with ur classmates cos it benefits them too,btohqsg
Eh but is retaking o levels,btohqsg
Or is just going to JC better,btohqsg
Depends on where u wanna go  your motivations and interest,btohqsg
no mock ;-( bedok solving my integration tutorial for me liao sia,btohqsg
If u scoring like 20 l1r5,btohqsg
Yes and then form groupchat or do u all alr have a class groupchat?,btohqsg
U can handle Ur contrasting subjrct and GP right?,btohqsg
left last qn sitting for past 2 days :(,btohqsg
Potassium manganate u grad alr rt,btohqsg
But i feel like if i ask,btohqsg
Eh but is the jump from prelims,btohqsg
so what happens if i score 13?,btohqsg
Ok then u get the most popular or well liked classmate to ask ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So ill just identify those who score well and ask from there,btohqsg
yes i joined in y4 cos i kiasi :â€™D,btohqsg
My point was just dont go if ure near the border if nt struggle manz,btohqsg
I see so many ppl retake in Ns,btohqsg
i see 1 in my course also in NS,btohqsg
but he was from a top JC,btohqsg
O/N chat help me troubleshoot all my careless mistake for math :D,btohqsg
the sch that made the lightbulb joke,btohqsg
wa ur guessing a bit... =.=,btohqsg
bless up im a normal kid,btohqsg
Bedok would triple if be could,btohqsg
You take pure or combined chemistry?,btohqsg
Then why do you want H3 lol,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t know you were so studious,btohqsg
so bedok next time uni chem?,btohqsg
i gg take uni chem oso,btohqsg
Tener or jay as Ur Mentor,btohqsg
Jay graduate yall hvn even enter uni,btohqsg
every week when i teach students i ask myself the same qn,btohqsg
Bedok  next year when u go JC  surely will have people discriminate u one  not just the student  teacher may also,btohqsg
dis why pcme is the way to go bedok,btohqsg
And show them what u can do,btohqsg
If he say he sec 5,btohqsg
or we can go bcme lads,btohqsg
Bcme is the way to go ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I played bball w some of them,btohqsg
h3 chem actually most worth imo,btohqsg
content jump not so big i feel,btohqsg
Dhs not v gd in terms of acads,btohqsg
I rarely hear from the sch,btohqsg
But culture wise nt bad i feel according to my frind,btohqsg
my opinion is every sch is good in their own ways,btohqsg
Their average RP is third in Singapore what,btohqsg
They r q self sufficient and closed off,btohqsg
Just study hard can alr right,btohqsg
how u get all these 'fake' news,btohqsg
Iâ€™m mainly interested in the community and the CCA opportunities,btohqsg
I know that their econs department damn stingy,btohqsg
School is know a social instrument,btohqsg
Dunmanâ€™s a level mean RP is supposedly 85,btohqsg
They literally cover up their good answer and save as PDF,btohqsg
Dhs niche cca is chinese orchestra,btohqsg
Dhs ppl are the nicest people iâ€™ve met in army la,btohqsg
only ip ppl i met are RI/HCI,btohqsg
Which sch y'all think most toxic,btohqsg
Wah Tener  is that ur cert,btohqsg
I always thought that bedok and MW are teachers..as they helps to answer a lot of the questionsðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
the nus high ppl i met,btohqsg
Nus high notntoxic coz they low eq,btohqsg
Legit all the nush ppl ive met,btohqsg
they are like ur aloysious in Ah boys to men,btohqsg
but they help too much until they fk every1 over unknowingly,btohqsg
Sst ppl v down to earth imo ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
SST is just a hyped up version of NUS High,btohqsg
I slowly becoming like an upper tier chanric but for jcs,btohqsg
Cos both are sch of science,btohqsg
Then on the other end of the spectrum,btohqsg
if NUS High is the trip to the moon  SST is the hindenburg,btohqsg
They r literally just beside my schl ðŸ‘€ and within 10min wakking dist LOL,btohqsg
Tbh I nevr heard of them before till J1,btohqsg
i know got 1 louis kwang ah,btohqsg
i mean... u might see me in pap 10 yrs down the road,btohqsg
Jc uniforms are ugly in general,btohqsg
u dont forget abt me can alr,btohqsg
will vote pap to support tener ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
But is taking 4 H2s a good idea though,btohqsg
I think I will be in opposition party,btohqsg
he is truly a Hope for a Better Age,btohqsg
ok la but based on my interactions with elite jc ppl ironically  the ppl that pissed me off first were HCI Ppl,btohqsg
Like is there any study method,btohqsg
Ri vj then cj for me,btohqsg
But I dislike Hwa Chong a lot,btohqsg
The people I happen to met in HC,btohqsg
hahaha the hc ppl i met nice sia,btohqsg
Depends on what sch U are from,btohqsg
based on my interactions yes in moe interview,btohqsg
Den ppl I met from RI and NUSH,btohqsg
Then the Hwa Chong people ostracised him because he â€˜onlyâ€™ got  A1s,btohqsg
My seniors say cj got high birth rate. true ah?,btohqsg
'' IF I DONT GET INTO THIS INTERNSHIP  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE!!!'',btohqsg
I have a friend from HC,btohqsg
i got h3 art  PICK ME!!,btohqsg
My exp nt v accurate cos i mean i frm rjAnd mw exp prolly nt v accurate cos he frm nj,btohqsg
Why does this sound so familiar,btohqsg
And double gold medal in chem and bio olympiad,btohqsg
I did not know such elite students even existed,btohqsg
Like he's not a level above me or anything  he's like a normal person,btohqsg
i also look down on my jc in sec 4,btohqsg
He treats me like how I treat him like anyone else,btohqsg
I tell u... no matter how well u do,btohqsg
end up karma went to that very jc,btohqsg
He's in the international chem Olympiad team I think,btohqsg
These kind of humble humble thign varies due to upbringing la,btohqsg
Once u have the sch tag ur credentials dun matter,btohqsg
U DONT SEE THAT IN RI BRO,btohqsg
He went in solo compeititon and beat all the J2 and poly year 3 student,btohqsg
Nothing to do w schools (all the more Jcs),btohqsg
Got la my friends not eh,btohqsg
FLEXing like as if they own an endless Pokemon card album,btohqsg
But do people in elite JCs have some type of mugging technique?,btohqsg
Sometime I know also flex alot,btohqsg
I for real need to learn how they study so effectively,btohqsg
In that sense this is alsosubjecfive,btohqsg
flexing once in a while is fine ba,btohqsg
They prob study uni stuff beforehand.,btohqsg
dont tell any1 ur rank point,btohqsg
Everything in life is subjective and a social construct. Discuss,btohqsg
cheebai whole NS Camp know i 90 rp,btohqsg
no one dare to fk with me,btohqsg
Oh yea  that guy he reading uni textbook everyday,btohqsg
My camp alot 90 sia LOL,btohqsg
Got one guy try flex is rp on me,btohqsg
He knows like the entire anatomy of the brain   even better than med student,btohqsg
He got rekt in law exam,btohqsg
People in elite JCs are actually Os studious,btohqsg
First time I met someone so strong,btohqsg
Highly competitive spirit. This spirit alone makes a huge difference cos it esteems them,btohqsg
The average joe in elite JCs (or RJ from what IK) dont go into uni stuff,btohqsg
The fact that he does chem bio olympiad  and did H3 math  is like idk man ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
And of cos accessibility to resources,btohqsg
As a matter of fact u dont need uni stuff to get 90 or even top 80 pctl++,btohqsg
Hahahah this convo is becoming retarded,btohqsg
Got one prc scholar in my school that watches uni math vids as a recreational activity,btohqsg
My friend doesnt study uni stuff and got top in a subject anyways ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
