Isnt there a transparent milk tea drink,btohqsg
oh shit memories  thought it'll give me cancer tho. so i stopped drinking that,btohqsg
probably milk tea with sulfur dioxide and a whole lot of potassium maganate,btohqsg
i drank the milk tea and i exploded,btohqsg
Jthat you'd blow up and act like u dont know nobody?,btohqsg
somebody pleaaase get my reference o lord,btohqsg
Walan. Only 50 bucks. At least 50million la,btohqsg
But the fine is only $300,btohqsg
Ya lor. Eat one time buffet gone liao,btohqsg
singaporean males do nothing wrong  gets sentenced to 2 years,btohqsg
He's thinking that giving $50 is better than $300. Little did he know  it turned out to be $300+4 weeks. So he saved $50  but there is a possibility he will be deported,btohqsg
What is the psychological threshold that people will yield to a bribe?,btohqsg
How would I know? He could be thinking illogically,btohqsg
technically if bribe > a year's salary then I think ill take the bribe,btohqsg
or if bribe > reward for reporting bribe,btohqsg
Ma main goal is to blo up. And act like i dont know nobody. HAHAHAHAHAHA 🦈🦈🦈🦈,btohqsg
But in Singapore I think it is more about punishing if you take the bribe,btohqsg
then if bribe > punishment for taking bribe,btohqsg
No one did a study how much does it take for a clean system to become corrupt?,btohqsg
OR if you are like a couple of people who justifies their high pay as a deterrent to corruption,btohqsg
do yall find it unreasonable if a person takes a break after running (walking without a mask) and gets fined by the police bc they coincidentally spotted the runner,btohqsg
U can test the cyber security infrastructure but hard to test integrity,btohqsg
bc if the person is running isn’t it more risky? and not get fined,btohqsg
Anybody know what the bellcurve for English usually is,btohqsg
Well  it's not about whether they coincidentally spotted the runner.,btohqsg
i feel like people walking for awhile after running shouldn’t be fined,btohqsg
I agree  IF the person is breathing hard.But the law is the law. It's a matter of whether they want to be flexible or not.,btohqsg
yeah it’s a matter of flexibility to me but some policemen are inflexible and just fine runners who walked,btohqsg
Once I ran and lowered my mask. The exact moment I started walking  the mask went back on,btohqsg
It's about safeguarding yourself against inflexible people,btohqsg
yeah which is a slight inconvenience to me,btohqsg
Why not Explain to the police That u just ran and the Sweat in the mask made it hard to breathe,btohqsg
and is putting on the mask back on even good for your skin with all the sweat?,btohqsg
but you have to do so if you don’t want to risk getting fined $300,btohqsg
they’d just think no mask= fine immediately,btohqsg
The law is the law.I would often refrain from doing something that would be considered in a 'grey area',btohqsg
even though you’re fully sweaty and in running attire,btohqsg
Can anyone send pdf physic combined paper 2,btohqsg
combined science is arguably the easiest subject for me,btohqsg
What about teachers who punish the one getting bullied because the victim fought back and they only saw the victim fighting back,btohqsg
i do it a lot of times,btohqsg
i really value convenience over going against the law,btohqsg
Link is thatPolice punishes people walking without a mask because they didnt see the person runningTeacher punishes victim because they didn't see the bullies bullying,btohqsg
I wait until the light turns green. Not one second before.,btohqsg
no i’m talking about where the traffic light is like 1km away,btohqsg
I can tell you are a law abiding citizen of Singapore,btohqsg
from the way he types as well,btohqsg
That's allowed. Let me show you a sign,btohqsg
This means  in the direction of the arrow below  you cannot jaywalk,btohqsg
Other direction  walking across the road is allowdd,btohqsg
There is a number of metres before the traffic light that you cannot jaywalk,btohqsg
JAYWALKING BECOMES AN OFFENCE FROM TODAY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEDESTRIAN CROSSING RULES. UNDER THESE RULES  A JAYWALKER IS LIABLE TO BE FINED UP TO $50. HOWEVER  A 'GRACE PERIOD' OF TWO MONTHS HAS BEEN ALLOWED DURING WHICH ERRANT PEDESTRIANS WHO FLOUT THE RULES WILL BE ISSUED A WARNING TICKET. FROM SEPTEMBER 1  THE FINE WILL APPLY. UNDER THE RULES  JAYWALKING MEANS NOT USING DESIGNATED CROSSING FACILITIES WHEN CROSSING A ROAD AT A POINT WITHIN 50 METRES OF SUCH FACILITIES. THESE DESIGNATED FACILITIES ARE OVERHEAD BRIDGES  UNDERPASS  ZEBRA CROSSING (WITH BEACONS) AND CROSSINGS WITH GREEN MAN-RED MAN LIGHTSCovering Date:30/06/1977,btohqsg
Ah  the old GEC traffic lights in Singapore,btohqsg
I believe the only surviving one is at the old Serangoon Bus Interchange,btohqsg
Guys how long do u guys usually power nap?,btohqsg
Ok imma power nap for 3hours then,btohqsg
Where in jewel are you thinking,btohqsg
Only went there once last year,btohqsg
Quieter and you don't need to safe entry,btohqsg
T1 and T3 has no safe entry,btohqsg
Which one no need safe entry,btohqsg
At home i always end up sleeping,btohqsg
so how should i study poa,btohqsg
What else to do at this point,btohqsg
T2 and T4 is closed. T1 and T3 are open with no safe entry needed,btohqsg
I plan to do a math and combined science,btohqsg
Study in my house u want?,btohqsg
If yall wanna study at like mcdonalds are starbucks gotta atleast order smth,btohqsg
and if busy gotta give way,btohqsg
@xinziiiiso how should i study for math,btohqsg
my lungs r weak as fuck alr,btohqsg
Gotta train your cardio aft Os mann,btohqsg
the allocation of cost of the non current asset over its estimated useful life. it is considered a part of cost of the non current asset used up to generate income,btohqsg
i can smoke twenty packets of cigars but not a packet of yupi bears,btohqsg
If i smoke yupi bears packet i get disowned,btohqsg
tbh it’s not even gna come out,btohqsg
Depreciation is when the value of sumn decreases Year by yeae,btohqsg
can i eat my himalaya salt candy before a levels,btohqsg
Omg hi jerlyn!  I have the same namebas you!,btohqsg
what topic did ur guys’ SS teacher predict will come out for srq,btohqsg
i have a feeling its more likely ch2 ch5,btohqsg
oh yeah cos n lvl citizenship alr,btohqsg
then sbq maybe its on globalisation lor,btohqsg
why is there greater diversity in sg,btohqsg
fr case study dont even bother spotting it lol,btohqsg
yup means this yr sbq wont be diversity,btohqsg
if last yr srq globalisation dont even bother,btohqsg
i srsly dt i will be citozenship,btohqsg
idt ch6 will come out thoo,btohqsg
experiences and effects of living in a diverse society,btohqsg
2018 came out on idk i think healthcare ch7,btohqsg
buut they may test ch7 again,btohqsg
assimilation all these as well as healthcare,btohqsg
they didn’t test driving forces of globalisation tho,btohqsg
shud read the background info tho,btohqsg
at least u get the gist of the info,btohqsg
What was the topic last year? Globalisation?,btohqsg
Do u go around catching kids,btohqsg
Bedok you shld have me take my chem paper on tuesday,btohqsg
Plus my sch and your sch distance so far,btohqsg
You can just photocopy ur own,btohqsg
But my teacher be like who tf are you,btohqsg
Haha you say you are Nixon,btohqsg
And got plastic surgery and look like you,btohqsg
Gonna pray both chem qn be at either or,btohqsg
Lol it’s not tested in O levels this year lol,btohqsg
but we have org chem together,btohqsg
Hmm thought you already ORD? You said before on 22 May,btohqsg
Without the basics  those students who may take H2 Chem may suffer later,btohqsg
Ah  you are younger than I imagined,btohqsg
my unit hasnt drawn up a plan justifying the need for reservists manpower,btohqsg
But if you put org chem into either or,btohqsg
The total marks reduction would be lesser than putting 2 different org chem in random qn,btohqsg
if you dont learn org chem in O levels you are gonna get fked in A levels,btohqsg
NO LETS HOPE THE WHOLE DATABASED Q IS ORGANIC CHEM 🤩🤩,btohqsg
Haha.. good ah.. those who did study for organic Chem can try,btohqsg
because between A and O levels  only org chem stays the same,btohqsg
seeing the wrecked state of the prev papers,btohqsg
So yeah jc not for me,btohqsg
TBH if you cant study poly is gonna be tough too,btohqsg
And my chem teacher said that if you wanna pursue ntu chem course,btohqsg
Your h2 chem syllabus would be taught in 6 months,btohqsg
because whilst the practical side is increased  the theoratical side is not really decreased,btohqsg
Nvm ill struggle when i get there,btohqsg
Now i struggle w os first,btohqsg
So he went to jc and struggle,btohqsg
He still got A for a lvl,btohqsg
I cant even get A for chem rn,btohqsg
But he also scored A in bio,btohqsg
The syllabus can be finished within 2,btohqsg
He said abt 6 months or less,btohqsg
But he said if you go jc,btohqsg
I slept thru my entire jc life and turned out fine,btohqsg
I kinda wished I put in more effort,btohqsg
U fear smth that doesnr exist,btohqsg
It is like end of me,btohqsg
Meanwhile the first reservist sim pilot is coming back next month,btohqsg
Maybe u get to be the first reservist too,btohqsg
wah fml I hope my unit doesnt draw up the plan,btohqsg
Idw to go to work john,btohqsg
If ure mentally resiliant then yes it is possible ngl,btohqsg
Infact u dont need to know all of it to score well for alevels either,btohqsg
If you sign on  your NS is your work,btohqsg
What i am doing right now is fun but tiring,btohqsg
Why is there a hitler in your pfp,btohqsg
Is a source from ph tys,btohqsg
Ngl signing on in NS sounds fun leh,btohqsg
My elect hist and pure bio same day,btohqsg
I wish i was a clerk john,btohqsg
my elect geog and chem same day,btohqsg
As in its a useless subjext,btohqsg
I took pure hist and elect lit,btohqsg
just need to bullshit your way thru,btohqsg
then my phy and poa paper 2 same day,btohqsg
My percentile for lit was 0.6,btohqsg
Not everyone finds the same subjects heavy tho,btohqsg
as in paper 2 is heavy,btohqsg
Jc bio is also a waste of time,btohqsg
I wont take even if theres a gun pointed at my head,btohqsg
Any BIO course in UNI requires more physics than bio,btohqsg
Got some people 3 paper a day,btohqsg
unless u rlly wn be doctor😌 or like be bio cher hahaha,btohqsg
Oh so that’s what this is about,btohqsg
Hcl paper 1 n 2 + pure lit lol,btohqsg
I mean he's not wrong  u can go meds in nus without bio so,btohqsg
No he got the joke u didnt HAHAHA,btohqsg
Even i am not on my level,btohqsg
He’s salty that he study bio but need to do physics,btohqsg
Hahaha i would have to time travel then,btohqsg
I take it rn and im suffering,btohqsg
Whagever u r learning is a lie,btohqsg
I mean they'll mind fk u in jc so........,btohqsg
Its not they will mind fuck u its just u take in stuff in olvls without questioning it,btohqsg
If u take FMaths expecting to escape thinking,btohqsg
Lol my friends r actl considering  i told them to get full marks for math first,btohqsg
If u wan thots go arts stream but if u wan thoughts take f maths,btohqsg
ow ah ow JC kao seng ka po bo beh zhao,btohqsg
U say not really tells me alr udk anyh,btohqsg
Coz all u r seeing is theoretical pov,btohqsg
He got a lot of friends from other course,btohqsg
He just told me don't go jc,btohqsg
But when u go there and struggle to maintain cumulative gpa coz u never do well in early courses or when u miss ur gpa to enter uni course by 0.5 or when all u do is projects with shit teammates,btohqsg
He got friends in jc too,btohqsg
U will realise that poly has its own downsides,btohqsg
Gpa prob be like 3.5 or more,btohqsg
His friends retain doesn’t mean u retain,btohqsg
They need to experience it to und,btohqsg
All I’m saying is don’t trust anecdotes,btohqsg
I see the o lvl paper compo like stun me,btohqsg
U go poly courses that require english ull also struggle. Even more so when u r require to present to secure attachments or jnternships,btohqsg
Unfortunately people write  read  talk and listen English  so it’s quite important,btohqsg
I don't expect myself to write essay in jc,btohqsg
Unless u go Chinese studies or something,btohqsg
So what makes u think JC is harder ? When the impact is much higher in poly than jc,btohqsg
Everytime when my teacher gave papers,btohqsg
Yes but wasting 1 year uk,btohqsg
You go poly is also 3y,btohqsg
You saying poly people all waste 1 year?,btohqsg
Doesnt matter where u go if ur fundamentals are weak bro,btohqsg
Go with 2 years and don't retain,btohqsg
And i got my eae alrd,btohqsg
I only like phys chem and math,btohqsg
Hahaha all higher level physics maths and chem studies require u to write longer “essays” than ur avg english exam,btohqsg
You’ll learn a lot of physics and chemistry in poly,btohqsg
Yeah  I’m posing that as a good thing,btohqsg
you cant do physics without maths,btohqsg
H2 physics doesn’t even touch basic calculus,btohqsg
Reminds me maybe i should bring phycis shit during night shifts,btohqsg
God bless covid nth much to do during night shift,btohqsg
then you can use your bullet trajectory to learn projectile motion,btohqsg
there is no other time in your life that you can lepak and play pubg,btohqsg
It becomes boring after like 1 hr i am then left with 11+ hrs of nothingness,btohqsg
Which is why i said i should bring phy stuff .-.,btohqsg
then 11+ hours would fly past,btohqsg
It really depends. For example  if I went to polytechnic  I would probably have failed.And JC stuff is very watered down  so it's not anything near impossible to do. Have confidence in yourself,btohqsg
2 years on I dont understand anything,btohqsg
And in JC  you technically can relax initially and study hard in the end and still get decent results. But in poly  you have a GPA,btohqsg
I went to poly cuz i know what i want to do,btohqsg
That you need to maintain from day 1,btohqsg
In secondary sch my studies are very inconsistent,btohqsg
but yeah I guess you could,btohqsg
When I was your age  my direction was completely different from now. How do you know you won't change?,btohqsg
Oh i thot you talking abt jc,btohqsg
But in poly  you have projects,btohqsg
I study everyday but sometimes less sometimes more,btohqsg
plus can let you become occifer in NS,btohqsg
plus can help you get uni,btohqsg
And in JC  if you need help  you have your teachers. I believe in poly they don't really are out to help you,btohqsg
I wouldn't say my decision was mature,btohqsg
You mean poly students cannot become officer?,btohqsg
but you look at the statistics,btohqsg
technically poly students also can enter uni,btohqsg
Some of my friends keep changing their mind about what they want to do. They graduated from uni but they are clueless,btohqsg
Good. But do you have a backup plan if it doesn't work out?,btohqsg
But in poly  if you want to go to uni in something unrelated  it might be hard to get in. You may need to start over,btohqsg
What if it doesn’t work out  as in you lose motivation to do it?,btohqsg
But how do you know you won't change,btohqsg
How do you know you don't love something else?,btohqsg
But my answer to this if I were you is that I’d willingly take the risk,btohqsg
THATS WHAT EVERY GUY SAYS WHEN HE FALLS IN LOVE,btohqsg
Take the risk to do what?,btohqsg
Take the risk that I might change in the future  and be stuck with a diploma unrelated to what I like in the future,btohqsg
I never loved mathematics until I was in JC1. So you never know,btohqsg
Had I gone to poly  even if I had done well  generally you cannot get into a mathematics course in uni,btohqsg
Exactly. With the ever changing skill set in demand  you never know what lies ahead,btohqsg
I know. But in general  in the future  what you dream of may not be possible,btohqsg
Because it is something i would truly enjoy doing,btohqsg
Idw to go to work doing things that i dislike,btohqsg
How do you know that what you do in the poly course and the uni course is what you like?,btohqsg
I research abt the module in poly,btohqsg
Uni i will research further next time,btohqsg
For example  some of my courses in uni has to be applied or heavily computational mathematics  and I hate them. But from the outside it is hard to tell that they are going to be like that. Applied is obvious. Computational  difficult to tell.,btohqsg
I was alrd offered by ngee ang poly,btohqsg
But you can just apply in JAE for JC  right,btohqsg
The withdrawal dateline was last week,btohqsg
You can accept and reject them later  right? I did this for unis,btohqsg
Can't you research? When your O level results come out  you never know  maybe you want to try to apply for JC and just reject the poly offer,btohqsg
Otherwise how can you safefguard yourself if another offer that is better hasn't come through,btohqsg
Why? Because your friends and brother scared you?,btohqsg
I just dw to go thru sec sch but harder,btohqsg
You must be prepared for mugging,btohqsg
kinda v cool to be stress,btohqsg
just cuz its easier doesnt mean its better,btohqsg
But i srsly dw to go jc,btohqsg
JC has this terrifying image built around it by teachers and seniors,btohqsg
But how do you know that you will score well enough in poly to get into uni?,btohqsg
jc gang jc gang jc gang jc gang jc gang,btohqsg
damn I wrote my new rap,btohqsg
When I went to JC  it was faster and harder than secondary  but it was possible to keep up  and it was fun to keep learning new things,btohqsg
I rly dw to go jc and learn humans,btohqsg
It seems like O levels is more stressful than A levels  because there are more subjects and things to care about such as CCA points,btohqsg
Chinese in JC is a non factor,btohqsg
You can do science. Economics is a social science,btohqsg
It will naturally come to you,btohqsg
And it doesn't affect uni admissions  unless you do better in chinese,btohqsg
Hmm not really though... not for most ppl... I mean if one just wants to just scrape through year 1  then probably ok,btohqsg
what if I wanna do chinese lit,btohqsg
I mean I didn't relax  but you technically can. But poly  the grades start counting from the first semester. In JC  no  except for PW,btohqsg
Ik you all trying to ask me not to follow other people's decision,btohqsg
We want you to be fully informed,btohqsg
Okay if you just want to promote  then can relax a bit,btohqsg
And for JC  if you need to retake A levels  it is easy as a private candidate,btohqsg
Lol PW.. may year 1 students mad rushing after promos,btohqsg
Just clear once and for all,btohqsg
If i go jc i btr be clearing it,btohqsg
I mean  if he needs to. But if he doesn't  which most people are like that  then well and good,btohqsg
JC don't suit me a lot,btohqsg
It’s good that poly is ur authentic choice and not something others decided for u,btohqsg
Very very few people in my classes in JC retained in J1,btohqsg
just dont go poly because you think its easy,btohqsg
Well.. I mean if you still undecided on what career path to take  jc can buy you some time to consider,btohqsg
Gucci Gang  ooh  yeah  Lil Pump  yeah  Gucci Gang  oohGucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gangGucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Spend ten racks on a new chainMy bitch love do cocaine  oohI fuck a bitch  I forgot her nameI can't buy a bitch no wedding ringRather go and buy BalmainsGucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Gucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gangGucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Spend ten racks on a new chainMy bitch love do cocaine  oohI fuck a bitch  I forgot her name  yeahI can't buy no bitch no wedding ringRather go and buy Balmains  ayeGucci gang  Gucci gang  Gucci gang,btohqsg
Poly kids usually learn their specialty subjects more in depth than most JC kids,btohqsg
I went to poly cuz ik what to do,btohqsg
But if you know what you want to work in future  then go for poly,btohqsg
ONLY FOREIGN SCHOLAR WILL DO WELL,btohqsg
In poly  you’ll be more attuned to work life,btohqsg
My class had tons of foreign scholars. And not all did super well,btohqsg
No  be born to rich parents and party all day,btohqsg
Or just grad with O levels,btohqsg
Yeah  as if your pay is high,btohqsg
LOL then you can take back your “ORDlo”,btohqsg
Sign on is always an option if u have nowhere else to go,btohqsg
If they don't offer you to sign on? Then how?,btohqsg
Anyway thanks for the talk just now,btohqsg
I am aware of what you guys are saying,btohqsg
After NS  brain rot as you said.. sign on  rot further?,btohqsg
Yes both jc and poly got downside,btohqsg
It’s ok  if u sign on you won’t need to use brain anyway,btohqsg
But for interest i will go towards poly,btohqsg
pls have any wospec without criminal background or health problems been rejected,btohqsg
Hmm if you want to climb,btohqsg
Just get 1WO and farm there,btohqsg
Do PES C and E get to sign on?,btohqsg
Sometimes people get PES C or E and they didn't expect it,btohqsg
My JC class had a number of people in PES C and E,btohqsg
Some people didn't expect anything  went for the checkup and they discovered a heart issue. Then PES F,btohqsg
You saw with your own eyes?,btohqsg
and everyone is half naked in bunk,btohqsg
How easy is PES C life,btohqsg
Guys i kenna mental condition before,btohqsg
Probably anything from PES B to F. Depends how serious and all that.Not sure if PES A is possible.,btohqsg
To manoeuvre oneself into Pes C,btohqsg
Because I have no medical condition but really don’t want to be in Pes B or A,btohqsg
C or E depending on severity,btohqsg
That's why fighting it is important,btohqsg
Most NSFs do not do enough to combat brain rot,btohqsg
PES F is also possible  depending on the condition.,btohqsg
Not going to say in front of 2000+ people,btohqsg
But my class was more unique as most if not all other classes did not have anything close of that ratio of foreign scholars,btohqsg
Eh same my class had nearly half from China,btohqsg
Honestly I just don't want to say it here but if you really want to know you can PM me,btohqsg
My class had Thai  Malaysian  Cambodian  Chinese and Indonesian. As far as I recall,btohqsg
Haven’t heard of this word “Wuhan” for a long time since the virus was renamed as COVID-19,btohqsg
It used to be called 2019-nCoV not Wuhan something,btohqsg
Wuhan used to be three cities  Wuchang  Hankow and Hanyang,btohqsg
Haha “Wuhan” was convenient representative name of the virus,btohqsg
And don't tell me that the name RJC is outdated because I know. I just want to use the older terms,btohqsg
Y know that big fuss china blew up over the naming of the flu,btohqsg
Well  mers and the spanish flu kinda pinpoints the location of the flu as well,btohqsg
China just kicking up a fuss for nothing,btohqsg
Now people think covid aint origin from china,btohqsg
Just because change name to english name,btohqsg
Everyone knows is from china tho,btohqsg
Uh MERS is middle eastern  so the parallel is calling covid the 'asian' or 'east asian' flu.The Spanish flu did not come from spain  but due to misinformation. Therefore  the argument is that the use of wuhan or chinese flu is racist and implicitly accusatory is subjectively valid,btohqsg
hi y’all! was wondering if there’s any chance the ss chapter for n levels will appear again for o levels? im trying to cut down what i study cos i have brain capacity 😔😔,btohqsg
what were the ss chap testing in Ns?,btohqsg
idt citizenship will come out honestly,btohqsg
this yr srq and last yr sbq came out on citizenship,btohqsg
based on trends they likely wont repeat,btohqsg
i think chapter 5 might be srq,btohqsg
sry i like nv touch ss stuff for v long,btohqsg
diversity cme out for sbq so idt sbq gonn come out on diversity,btohqsg
now i prepping for amath lmao i messed up p1,btohqsg
why is there greater diversity in sg,btohqsg
ch7 cme out bfr but it can be on assimilation if they act wan to test ch7 again,btohqsg
its not 100% it will come out,btohqsg
so probably like the issue 3 will come out,btohqsg
