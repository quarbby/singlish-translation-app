Does anyone know if we use Instarem + Citi cashback to top up grab will incur extra charges with Citibank anot?,btohqsg
They send me some Citi-credit limit statement I shock,btohqsg
statement only can see adjusted points lump sum  mixed with 1x point. If want to monitor bonus points  need to minus off the 1x points. Or monitor total points each day close to 20th.,btohqsg
"dun think there is extra charges for this if you meant Amaze card linked with citi cashback. What u mean by ""credit limit statement""? what u see in the statement? Why using this anyway  no rebate  dun clock min spend.",btohqsg
I tried using GXS to pay for grab cause of their points promotion now  but keep unable to authorize on grab app,btohqsg
Dk is it cause I never transfer the amount from the savings pocket to the main pocket,btohqsg
ok  i will take a look  they just send me an email whenever i top up my grab card  which is so weird  cause they dont usually dont and then there is like a credit ready/ credit card charges,btohqsg
I think immediately opening the account got 1 working day before fast is enable  I had issue also but just wait 1 working day it will be okay,btohqsg
Balance that grab deduct need to be from main saving account not from savings pocket,btohqsg
what is the exact description of the charge?,btohqsg
Just want to double confirm thatHigh Yield Savings Plus Accountno need to maintain min $ in account right? No fall below fee,btohqsg
You see the service you are doing is top up to wallet then pay some grab service,btohqsg
i think charge directly via amaze,btohqsg
its my first time doing something like that so im not sure if you all have this before,btohqsg
Oh great thanks for letting me know,btohqsg
I think better to check the transaction type that grab did,btohqsg
Or you paying their pay later,btohqsg
Nope it‚Äôs to top up the wallet,btohqsg
No charge incurred ah only visa got,btohqsg
Anyone uses OCBC Titanium  is it an alternative to HSBC Revo card?,btohqsg
Ok I will update the chat if I got charge. Hahaha,btohqsg
Thank you all for the help,btohqsg
Someone was asking when will UOB ONE Saving bonus interest  for Jan be credited. You can see it your account now!!,btohqsg
This is a normal email sent by citi. I assume you topped up a amount that is higher then your set threshold  hence the email sent.For myself my threshold is $0.01 so I receive the email everytime thing the card is charged,btohqsg
Latest tbill at 3.88%. Seems like the 1 year tbill was not an outlier.,btohqsg
"I found that for the Salary crediting requirement  you can fulfill it by doing your own interbank transfer and put the Transfer purpose as ""Salary""..",btohqsg
You sure ? That works ??,btohqsg
Use fast fund transfer and put note Salary? Lol,btohqsg
Yes  I tried yesterday.. it is alreadly reflected as activities in my UOB TMRW,btohqsg
Then  I can have 2 salary crediting. 1 to ocbc and fast transfer to uob,btohqsg
"I transfer from DBS account  there is a dropdwon menu where you can select ""Salary""",btohqsg
Hmm ü§îüòèüòèüòè gonna try hahahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
yeah you try and reconfirm here..,btohqsg
Guessing need wait for their system to reflect it see if detect,btohqsg
"see next month  whether they ""cancel"" it .. haha",btohqsg
Can't be refunded back to u lah maybe no detect as salary,btohqsg
"I saw in dbs ""purpose of transfer"" salary payment",btohqsg
"I mean whether they ""nullified"" that activity.. nevertheless  I am still crediting my actual salary from my Company la..",btohqsg
Wah lau. That means  its your company salary that take effect. Not the fund transfer,btohqsg
i Just open ONE account and will have my first salary crediting this month. But I still can see whether the my own transfer is still in record.,btohqsg
my own transfer yesterday was reflected,btohqsg
when my Co salary is credited  the activities will be the total of ($1 600+my salary)/$1 600,btohqsg
"if my $1 600 transfer is ""nuliffied""  then it will show only my salary/$1 600",btohqsg
Just wonder if this is loop hole or not,btohqsg
if it is from another account from a different name  it is difficult to filter..,btohqsg
The inverted relationship between 6-month and 1-year is now almost zero.,btohqsg
Changing sgd to usd incur $2usd  per trade. If I rem correctly.,btohqsg
