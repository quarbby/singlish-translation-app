Haha ðŸ˜‚ seems like thereâ€™s a competition going on between the banks to see who can provide worse service.I applied for SC Unlimited and approved on the 6th Oct.Until today card still not here.,btohqsg
Could be stuck @ SingPost though,btohqsg
I applied for the uob absolute cashback at the start of the month? Until now I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s the status LOL. called the hotline but the cs werenâ€™t very helpful.On the other hand  hsbc is quite good tho. Was quite surprise,btohqsg
Has anyone got their Revolut 20% cashback from sep?,btohqsg
Hello! I've started using my citibank cash back credit card but I dont understand how the cashback is calculated on the app. I got few dining transactions that are not pending anymore (total around 200$) but the cashback shown is less than 0.50cts. I would have expected something like  6% of 200$ to be shown on the app but that's not the case. Any idea? Thanks!,btohqsg
u got spend min $800 posted in statement month?,btohqsg
So the dining/groceries/petrol cashback total amount will be shown on the app after the $800 will be spent ?,btohqsg
few days after statement date then will receive the bonus 5.75% or 7.75% and will auto credit the cashback (multiples of $10) if accumulated min $50 cashback. Remaining will reflect in app,btohqsg
Ya HSBC one I call before not bad,btohqsg
Uob evol and live fresh won't count towards cashback for hospital contact less right,btohqsg
When i pay at counter its MCC 8062  but if pay online its MCC 8099. MCC 8099 is not excluded for UOB one but im not sure for evol,btohqsg
Anyone what is the MCC for clinic like Fullerton Healthcare?,btohqsg
MCC 8099 is not excluded but im not sure if it works the same if u pay online,btohqsg
payment online of mcc 8099 should count to uob evol online,btohqsg
May I ask what is the MCC code for driving license centre  Bukit Batok? Tried to find online but unable to. Looking for cashback either UOB EVOL / HSBC Revolution,btohqsg

Question: can i invest all my CPF OA or need to have a bal of $20k remain inside?  Thanks.,btohqsg
Any idea where to find the T&Cs for this? Can't find anything online,btohqsg
Is it true that owning more than 4 credit cards will affect credit score?,btohqsg
You can only invest after setting aside 20k in ur OA.,btohqsg
What will affect your credit score is when u dont pay the bills. Sometime late payment also dont affect the score as long as u pay. My friend hold more then 20 card with various bank score still Aa,btohqsg
However holding too many credit card does mean it will taken into consideration when you are apply loan in future as it does goes into the total debt ratio consideration. Always good to maintain a good credit score so that future loan will be easier to approve as it is a tracl record for bank to review your repaying reputation,btohqsg
If no debt will not affect total debt ratio right? Does not matter if have many credit cards.,btohqsg
In theory holding credit card mean u have borrow credit in access,btohqsg
If u hold mulitple credit card with mulitple bank let say 5k limit with 10 bank  it mean u can owe 50k for credit card debt,btohqsg
It does affect how bank view your possible debt situation  varies from bank to bank,btohqsg
Yes yes that's what i feel too. Might want to buy flat in the near future,btohqsg
I was call up by citibank recently as i apply for my 6th card with them  they advice me to cancel 1 as they only allow 5 card with them at most,btohqsg
I call them up and ask why  then they say it is company policy  which i think have to do with default risk with too many credit card. However mine was secured credit card so after much explanation i was approve for the 6th card,btohqsg
So even though the credit card share same credit limit  it still is a concern to the bank if u hold too many credit card ( higher default risk/bad debt),btohqsg
Do mind that i pay the credit card once i make the spending and no default risk  the department still need to assess the 6th card risk to them,btohqsg
I have to get them to check the past record and explain to them i am big spender,btohqsg
This is just Citibank's policy ah,btohqsg
Yup correct which i refer to varies from bank to bank,btohqsg
But this is an example of how bank access your default risk at the backenf,btohqsg
Hello guys  does anyone know if the citibank cashback card linked to amaze give cashback when spending overseas? (As instarem card converts all transactions to online?),btohqsg
Like i hold around 7 to 8 card with uob  no question ask for secured credit card but i do have long spending history with uob,btohqsg
yes  so long mcc is eligible,btohqsg
ok but does this affect credit score or total debt servicing ratio?,btohqsg
This exact u can ask the bank when you are applying for loan. Every bank have different consideration. Do rmb that bank go through credit bereau check before approving any loan  meaning they can see the number of credit card u hold with every sg bank.,btohqsg
It is all about different bank risk assessment. Just like insurance company,btohqsg
What will happen more likely is that if one bank view the credit card as possible debt they might lower the loan amount that they are willing to approve to you,btohqsg
Do note the idea of a credit card is borrowing future credit  even if u dont use it today u can in future. So bank review all this  bank are typical to borrow u umbrella on sunny day and take it bank on rainy day  they are not charity  it is profit driven,btohqsg
