For dbs wwmc you can use this rough calculation for points (with some rounding)  assuming your transaction is S$Z:SGD non-bonus points = 0.2 x S$ZSGD bonus points = 1.8 x S$ZFCY non-bonus points = 0.6 x S$ZFCY bonus points = 1.4 x S$Z,btohqsg
yes  need to go down. I have an existing credit card  so the bank deemed i'm existing customer   so have to go down to open :(,btohqsg

Hi! Does anyone know how to see the interest generated with tiger vault auto sweep? Is this paid daily?,btohqsg
I've managed to have my transaction yesterday posted on same day  these include Shell  Guardian and Giant. So I've meet the spend  I needed it for my UOB one bonus interest. You may try that as well.I've also checked my last statement  apparently  Cold Storage  Starbucks  SPC and Shell have the same transaction date and posted date  so these merchant get posted on the same day. You may try 2 or more just in case.,btohqsg
Please note. I called UOB CS and asked how come my cashback is less than what I calculated. The CS told me transactions posted on the last day of the month will be considered spending for the next month.,btohqsg
I know the cashback is posted one month later. But if you have transactions POSTED on last day of the month  they are included in the calculation of min $600  but you will not get cashback one month later or 2 months later.,btohqsg
I speak from my own experience. Happened to me 2 months so I called UOB to clarify. And this is what UOB CS told me.,btohqsg
Oh I meant it for the savings account interest not the credit card,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wanna check your opinions on using  Premiermiles to pay insurance via Citi PayallDoes it make sense? Or thereâ€™s better options out there?,btohqsg
"wait for new promo? the current promo ""ended"".",btohqsg
My insurance is a monthly 1 so I donâ€™t want to waste the chance to clock miles too,btohqsg
I meant depends if posted before or after cutoff time,btohqsg
Wasted 1+ hr queueing at ocbc to buy Tbills then they tell me closed accepting at 12pm,btohqsg
That's is to dbs I go,btohqsg
That kinda goes back to how you value a mile isn't it? ðŸ¤”(you are paying 1.67 cents per mile for the normal Citi Payall rate  so...),btohqsg

Hello  new to investing.I would like to do a DCA for S&P etf monthly. Is FSM one a good choice? As there are so many platforms which one should i choose?,btohqsg

hi can i ask which mile/ points credit card is good for buying flight tickets?,btohqsg
Does Syfe allow fractional buying of ETFs?,btohqsg
Not sure if allowed  please let me know if not. My sister discovered fraudulent transactions on her DBS credit card amounting to $3.9k but DBS is asking her to settle the bill while they investigate. She shouldn't have to pay right?,btohqsg
I had a smaller amount with UOB. They told me they will refund the amount and investigate. But if itâ€™s not fraud they will charge me the amount.,btohqsg
So nope I donâ€™t think she should pay,btohqsg
Ya lor that's more reasonable. Ok thanks  just wanted to get a second opinion,btohqsg
hmm interesting to know. I have it on DBS albeit smaller amt. They just cancel my card and re issue  I pay nothing for it,btohqsg
