you think anyone will suddenly decide to learn badminton from you just from one random post in telegram? I think you are just trying to indirectly advertise the badminton group together with Jia Cheng.,btohqsg
I am not affiliated with him  why do you want to jump to conclusions? lolmy apologies if posting group links is not allowed ah. not my intention to advertise the group to others here,btohqsg
Do not advertise in my group.,btohqsg

Anyone know if multiple Citi premieremiles card = extra lounge access (eg. 2 per card ),btohqsg
If yes  how do I add my extra entitlement from 2nd card to priority pass.,btohqsg
Not sure about multiple CPM cards. But each card will be only entitle to a single PP account iirc. So if you have more cards  will be multiple PP accounts.Hope others can assist to clarify as well.,btohqsg

if iâ€™m heading to Japan  would revolut or a citi cashback + card be the best to use for spendings there?,btohqsg
Sup guys  EGA 4.55% promo is only for monthly incremental for 4 months. Like that would it be more worth to put fullteron USD cash fund at 4+% currently?,btohqsg
I not sure if I math it right. Would like some opinion,btohqsg
eh. different point of comparison. one is a fund  the other is a savings/current acct. Cash fund can lose capital.,btohqsg
Hi guys  may i ask what the iras mail address for giro is?,btohqsg

Anyone having issue with hawker $3 cashbackâ€¦ brought a breakfast this morning from a store i visited every weekâ€¦ did not receive cashback this time,btohqsg

For Everday+ Rewards Programme:1) what type of transactions are considered eligible 5 transactions?2) 2 criterias to meet is based on calendar month?,btohqsg

Hi guys. Does ShopBack vouchers count as eligible spend for credit cards?,btohqsg
never receive even an hour later,btohqsg
Same.. I haven't received even after more than 2 hours ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Was looking at the TnC for CIMB. I think itâ€™s excluded under online shopping?,btohqsg
I think it depends on shopback's MCC classfication of the voucher,btohqsg
Managed to saw this notification for paylah,btohqsg
Got my $3 instantly for DBS Paylah lunch. Even though the message at paylah says will credit the cashback by end of day,btohqsg
I would think it will be your Citi rewards/ uob ladycard + amaze will be the best combo   otherwise you can use your cashback + amaze .,btohqsg
Youâ€™re welcome   just to add even if youâ€™re not into miles   you can convert Citi thankyou point to cash ( though not worth ) its roughly 4% cashback on top of the amaze rewards 1% . By paying the spread instarem 1.5%-2% you still get about 3% of cash back,btohqsg
