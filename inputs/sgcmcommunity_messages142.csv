Maybe try my OBD  but my car came with it anyway,btohqsg
my friend say need OBD eleven,btohqsg

Ehh sometimes when I do 3 point turn or parking I just whack from drive to reverse to drive without the car even stopping,btohqsg
i know u got money to repair but omg,btohqsg
Haha I only know people say is bad,btohqsg
Later bring friend go mbs eat   carpark also Xiong sia,btohqsg

Sometimes I paiseh make people wait so just whack Lor,btohqsg
If my MU or GB piang,btohqsg
No one will pity u when ur car enter hospital,btohqsg
Or isit need overhaul entire thing,btohqsg
They change. Going to be $14 soon,btohqsg
Overhaul not cheap   many yrs ago   I sent in to overhaul A6   pocket cries,btohqsg
If u got money just change whole thing,btohqsg
I not sure I kanna carrot or what,btohqsg
Overhaul sometimes dk they got do properly anot,btohqsg
After that I stopped buying Audi,btohqsg
I thought gonna be like 3-4K max,btohqsg
B9.5 idk. B9 new GB around 8k brand new,btohqsg
But you can get for like 4k lah,btohqsg
B9.5 expect around 8-9k brand new,btohqsg
Many yrs back and now   the different won’t be too far apart,btohqsg
4K second hand one ah? Later drive 1 month spoil again,btohqsg
Even if I whack neutral to rev also a no go ah?,btohqsg
Rev limiters exist for a reason,btohqsg
Once in awhile for feels ok  but everday is just asking for it,btohqsg
Then still okay  unless it’s cold.,btohqsg
But assuming in gear 4 rolling whack to neutral leh?,btohqsg
Sometimes ah  in carpark gear 1/2 wanna make noiseOr sometimes wanna rev on highway,btohqsg
Just stop whacking ur gearbox and drive in sports mode,btohqsg
Like the other day I beside@historyofmanwhack neutral and rev mah,btohqsg
This Guy keesiao one. Tailgate me. My ball drop sia,btohqsg
Sky Not pete😂😂 if advice good he listen one,btohqsg
Better be upfront now than I spoil my GB and fork out 9k,btohqsg
You whack into neutral in 4th gear  you’re putting yourself in danger.Being in neutral at speed means your engine has no load and you can’t just expect your DSG to pick a gear and go where you left off. That few seconds where you have no engine power  if something goes wrong  you’re mega foxed.Also  that would be bad for the GB.,btohqsg
Please don’t do that. I’ve had knob heads do that on highways and end up killing themselves because they have no engine power when they need it…,btohqsg
Now sports car very common on the road sia,btohqsg
I say this not to call you irresponsible or stupid  but it’s a stupid thing to do. Your life is worth more than that,btohqsg
I shall take care of my GB now,btohqsg
Although I think it’s at the end of lifespan soon anyway,btohqsg
I tot Pete usually this hr very active 1,btohqsg
Revving with the limiter also fun mah,btohqsg
Heard Audi GB MU last only 45k-60k,btohqsg
Yes  but ehh might be voided,btohqsg
I read the warranty clause  if I drive for PHV it might be voided,btohqsg
No need drive for PHV also they will find different ways of voiding.,btohqsg
Aiya anyway end of the day max maintenance I hope to not hit is 10k per year,btohqsg
Otherwise my wallet gonna be gg,btohqsg
Take care of your car  it’ll go far.,btohqsg
Wait so you speeding on highway then change to neutral then go back to ‘D’?,btohqsg
Maintenance of my B9 also never hit 3k a year,btohqsg
HAHAHA Yes but not gonna to anymore,btohqsg
Sky  show you ok? You want shiok?,btohqsg
But if I do that then I will fly off far far,btohqsg
Highway don’t go above 3rd gear can liao,btohqsg
Car already shifts for you anyways…,btohqsg
Haha you know what I do when I change to manual,btohqsg
I just whack to the max limit gear,btohqsg
I think you should change your exhaust  decat then tune pops and bangs,btohqsg
Don’t want lah  I drive my wife and parents around a lot,btohqsg
And maxhaust itself they already complain a lot  must turn off when they enter,btohqsg
