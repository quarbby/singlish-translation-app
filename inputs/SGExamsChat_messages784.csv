They are like mercenaries for politics,btohqsg
We support you but u give us all u got,btohqsg
I thought that had to do more with Brexit? Not rly the lib dem deal,btohqsg
Unless I‚Äôm missing out on something,btohqsg
They did lmao which is why it's funny,btohqsg
Mf was chipping away at their own foundations,btohqsg
imagine if the snp collapses in the GE,btohqsg
Tbh at this point I still don‚Äôt know what the policy positions of the lib dems are. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúvote for us because we‚Äôre not tories‚Äù so ok but what can they offer if they beat the tories,btohqsg
If I were a UK voter though I‚Äôd vote tactically and choose the candidate which has the highest chance of beating the tories,btohqsg
They alr pissed off with Brexit,btohqsg
humza yousaf GONE!rishi sunk SOON TO BE GONE!kier starmer THE NEXT PM!,btohqsg
Anyway  we just have 2+ more days until the results of the UK local elections are out,btohqsg
I want to see how large a margin Sadiq Khan wins over his Tory opponent,btohqsg
im still here waiting for  the reppublican primaries,btohqsg
For the senate or the house?,btohqsg
anyws  drop ur SG cabinet reshuffle predictions,btohqsg
I really think Utah might flip ngl,btohqsg
are u out of ur mind??,btohqsg
Utah is different bruh like especially after Roe V Wade,btohqsg
I hope Lauren Boebert loses. But unfortunately in Colorado‚Äôs 4th district  Ken Buck‚Äôs replacement for the special election said that he does not intend to run in the general election,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt Utah not a swing state,btohqsg
It normally isn't but then again Georgia was also not a swing state until 2020,btohqsg
But a straw poll showed that Lauren isn‚Äôt close to being first in the primary so hopefully that materialises,btohqsg
Oh well I guess I have to look at the polls,btohqsg
For the presidential election though  I hope RFK would do decently even if he doesn‚Äôt win,btohqsg
The Americans need to know that 3rd party candidates can win and voting for them is not a vote wasted,btohqsg
I have no idea for Arizona,btohqsg
But until the electoral college is abolished and replaced with a 2 round voting system  it would be hard to break up the duopoly,btohqsg
It's like a wild card for that,btohqsg
At this point it looks like it‚Äôs going to be Lake vs Gallego,btohqsg
It's gonna be a 2 horse Biden V Trump most likely,btohqsg
If momentum for RFK fades it‚Äôs quite likely,btohqsg
RFK would take votes away from both candidates but it remains to be seen how much from each of them,btohqsg
Some thinks he would eat into more of Biden‚Äôs votes than Trump‚Äôs  some think otherwise,btohqsg
I miss the Liz truss memes,btohqsg
Liz truss sounded more intelligent when she was with the lib dems tho lol,btohqsg
It's the electoral college so even if it does the end of the day I will benefit the Dems or Rep,btohqsg
Even without the electoral college won‚Äôt it still benefit one candidate over another as long as the 3rd party candidate steals more from the either of them,btohqsg
Actually do you want to join jj‚Äôs politics chat group,btohqsg
If you go we can go in together lol,btohqsg
as long as yall are SG based idm,btohqsg
we have sec  jc  ns and uni kids,btohqsg
In theory yes but due to the spoiler effect most of the time it's just R or D,btohqsg
Are they all extremely knowledgeable about politics or some of them have a rudimentary understanding,btohqsg
Is it cos the spoiler may take away more votes in some particular swing states,btohqsg
But I‚Äôll leave it up to E120,btohqsg
I also not sure if I should join in myself,btohqsg
decent understanding  we all have one that we focus on more,btohqsg
Not rlly the swings don't matter. It's more of the fact their policies are gonna be stealing votes for either Rep or Dem,btohqsg
U can look at the 1912 election,btohqsg
Splitting the ticket made Wilson the winner,btohqsg
RFK is an environmentalist but also anti vaccination,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs why I think he can steal votes from both,btohqsg
But also he appeals to those who hate Washington creatures or the chaos under trump,btohqsg
You can get a good sense based on that,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt really looked into it yet,btohqsg
But based on what u say most likely it would split the ticket for Rep,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt really clear at this point  since there are polls that suggest both scenarios. But one thing for sure is that the candidates from the 2 parties are desperately trying to paint RFK as more ideologically aligned to their opponents  in hopes that voters who are considering either of them and RFK won‚Äôt vote for RFK,btohqsg
Like trump keeps trying to paint RFK as some radical liberal lol,btohqsg
Yeah both know and are trying to offload the shift on the other part in an attempt to split the ticket. Even RFK himself is not sure,btohqsg
ü§Æ A S'pore-born vet in Australia was found guilty of drinking dog fluids & committing inappropriate acts on dogs.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3UEv62RFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg

He needs more consistency + he got a few nemesis,btohqsg

Wah this one no one can beat,btohqsg
"I would go "" eh I tot 30mins Oni"" ""how come 2.5hr""",btohqsg
Then u studying till wee hrs ah,btohqsg
It seems like more than that,btohqsg
Wah damn‚Ä¶it is ok  finals ending can sleep 24h also can,btohqsg
it has been screwed whenever I enrol in an institution,btohqsg
sleep at 5-7am  wake up 12-2pm  sleep at 6-8pm,btohqsg
lol my body refuses to let me sleep longer than 9h,btohqsg
and if i don't get up i'll feel like absolute dogshit,btohqsg
This one can either buy coffin or go ICU a&e,btohqsg
Same‚Ä¶and the longer i sleep the more tired i feel,btohqsg
this one can train one just like fitness,btohqsg
it's okay you'll be able to sleep eventually,btohqsg
after finals i still got a bunch of things to do,btohqsg
I will fall asleep then wake up at midnight thinking ‚Äòshit wasted that 2h‚Äô then go back to do some work before gg to bed,btohqsg
When the next day got sch,btohqsg
why tf U go back soa,btohqsg
Literally have btr things to do,btohqsg
"then wake up being like ""fuck im functioning with 2h of sleep""",btohqsg
I go back because i havent grad yet,btohqsg
At the rate I'm going...for me is 5,btohqsg
that's cause u have an alarm,btohqsg
like how my classmate miss term 1 cuz of surgery,btohqsg
My body clock rlly GG the sleep debt gonna hit me rq,btohqsg
This happens w prolonged periods of insufficient sleep,btohqsg
normally I need 9-10hrs of sleep,btohqsg

Tbh i think i hv never gotten out of A level burnt out,btohqsg

My classmate miss majority of the school yr  in oct decided to withdraw and comes back the following yr,btohqsg
my europe trip and intern is my way of unburning out,btohqsg

Tbh i find intern much more enjoyable than the rest of the undergrad journey,btohqsg
If u hv nice ppl ard u,btohqsg
Work vs study  which is ur take,btohqsg
wld u rather pay someone to get tortured,btohqsg
She was the cause of my pw became 4 membered,btohqsg
I 3-4 but most of the times 3,btohqsg
My cher reported it to moe,btohqsg
my pw cher put one problematic guy in my group cause she tot i cld deal w him,btohqsg
But idk if they even do anything,btohqsg
But everyone needa agree + write a report on how that person affected us,btohqsg
so i think no pt alr,btohqsg
maybe i'll crash in europe and die,btohqsg
meanwhile i was initially put in same grp as someone we enemies,btohqsg
Then she told cher she wanna to swap grp,btohqsg
Were u a peer support leader,btohqsg
My pw grp had entirely top scorers.,btohqsg
That is how i got that mia one,btohqsg
since when does MI has peer support leader,btohqsg
I think becoz of this  we lost the person in the grp that el dist,btohqsg
is this a mr loo initiative,btohqsg
so wld u rather enemy or mia,btohqsg
Anything wrong i would blame the president,btohqsg
Coz i think they needa take results into acct (i mean for fairness purposes),btohqsg
Oh yea  I nvr got to ask what is iestin's current age,btohqsg
tf dooood my Cher didn't say shit abt it,btohqsg
6 MORE CHAPTERS OF QM TO STUDY AND 10 CHAPTERS OF MATH,btohqsg

im using the pyp to study...,btohqsg
fuck I read this as ppp,btohqsg
mj confession: why after merger the fkktball team so terrible?,btohqsg
2019 still ok but it went downhill,btohqsg
it's ok i did that so you can do it too,btohqsg
just because you can doesnt mean i can D::::,btohqsg
He actly ENGAGES with the pupils,btohqsg
Is it open book close book or close book w cheat sheet,btohqsg
Me now realising I can actually get cheatsheet from seniors.,btohqsg
I am almost done tho HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I wasted 1 wk for this,btohqsg
mine was insane back then  but probs got diff content nowadays,btohqsg
not a waste bc you're revising while writing it down,btohqsg
Now we are reduced to 2 page cheatsheet knstead of 4 pages,btohqsg
when i mean ace i mean get a D and pass this mod,btohqsg
When his tears has dried up,btohqsg
not having to retake a mod is a win,btohqsg
you think i think who think,btohqsg
certainly not i think because im not thinking most of the time,btohqsg
you think i ask who confirm,btohqsg
You ask I think who knows,btohqsg
just get from wyatt when he's done,btohqsg
just get mc from siyan  skip the finals,btohqsg
Once I am done w ps2,btohqsg
i am gonna play my ps5,btohqsg
Eh sorry  once I am done w mh2801 chtsht HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
i nvr wanna do another cheat sheet ever again,btohqsg
Did anyone hv to retake before,btohqsg
i almost had to retake mechanics,btohqsg
Then get 0??? I think gg for the paper and yolo has a lower opportunity cost,btohqsg
I so badly need to ask this but how did you score for mechanics?,btohqsg
but mc is like a valid reason what,btohqsg
its bad enough that my gpa will never recover anymore,btohqsg
if you MC finals  it's basically as tho the mod was never taken,btohqsg
so won't affect GPA but must retake,btohqsg
I thot that applied to y1,btohqsg
Finals no make up so idk what happens,btohqsg
yea i had a senior that i saw in multiple finals bc she kept retaking,btohqsg
Need to apply for some special consideration,btohqsg
oh ya u cannot mc cuz of what u did lah,btohqsg
you usually can't skip finals and expect to get graded properly,btohqsg
Yea but that does not mean skipping finals hv no repercussions,btohqsg
like usually when people say dabao a mod they just mean MC finals then try again next sem/year,btohqsg
Covid times still can online finals if u sick,btohqsg
or choose another mod if it's not compulsory,btohqsg
Oh wait if u mc finals the mod can be not in ur cap ah,btohqsg
In nus will affect cap i believe,btohqsg
you won't get teh AUs  you won't get the grade,btohqsg
it's really as tho you never took the mod,btohqsg
I dun think nus can unless maybe nego w them,btohqsg
idk maybe your course also works differently,btohqsg
U know my rp actually can allow me to go nus fos when they merged üòÇ,btohqsg
my rp allows me to apply for ntu physics again!,btohqsg
I sometimes qn myself why i didnt apply for nus,btohqsg
Huh why cannot when it was unmerged,btohqsg
not if i extend my candidature hehe,btohqsg
Ok but tbh I still dont like what they do to the curriculum,btohqsg
You see their yr 1 plan,btohqsg
Fun fact i did not know the rp cops until like a 1-2 mths ago,btohqsg
Who the hell made the curriculum idk,btohqsg
I hv always been relying on the igp thingy,btohqsg
But they made the first year literally for 1 sem is 1/5 is actual phy related mod,btohqsg
LIKE FOR NTU IS 7  NUS IS LIKE 12?,btohqsg
Tbh it is just more like making the GE mod become the common curriculum + some others,btohqsg
but as someone who has cleared most of it if u put in effort it just inflates ur gpa,btohqsg
Yea real‚Ä¶coz ppl will be looking to su it,btohqsg
ya exactly cos so many ppl want to SU u put in abit of effort u can get A-/Aalr,btohqsg
Then make it easier to pull up cap,btohqsg
The lit mod is crazy for a sci std to take it tho,btohqsg
Coz lit is my greatest enemy,btohqsg
as someone who studied lit before i hated hsh,btohqsg
its not a lit mod they just tell you how they want u to interpret the text,btohqsg
Then needa act out some play rightüíÄ,btohqsg
But thank god only the script is graded,btohqsg
i js woke up from a nap,btohqsg
I dont feel like doing bio anymore but ehh,btohqsg
why do you have tele premium,btohqsg
With an impossible IB grade to get in,btohqsg
Nah she just drop out of MI to take as private,btohqsg
Oh idk then I thought she was just in MI from the start then drop out and became private,btohqsg
Private got private school and then just Leroy Jenkins as candidate,btohqsg
Make use of randkmkd to clarify your geog qns lol,btohqsg
Hopefully we have another h2 geog A here,btohqsg
Me when I vet through@whatisgrasssch geog notes and tell her that they're missing content,btohqsg
Now that she‚Äôs private idk if she can even access MI notes,btohqsg
If not have to find online,btohqsg
I have all of MI notes,btohqsg
ohohoh  I got in as a pr with way lower than sg average,btohqsg
hmm ok. i mean ntu eee isnt hard to get in  like if u tell me u got in with 30+ i wont be surprised,btohqsg
Isok I got hci noted also,btohqsg
The teachers just cannot teach properly,btohqsg
Then it is btr off to suffer more in a sch system tho,btohqsg
Coz u get no shit as a private candidate,btohqsg

Someone said this and i got a very big feeling..that is what china is doing  playing the playbook of hitler,btohqsg
No idea. Anyway Reddit full of nonsense,btohqsg
i mean experts have said it..but could be biased,btohqsg
I will be bias if i am under Kyiv post too ü§£,btohqsg
We have built a strong foundation for our future generations.Here's a recap of PM Lee Hsien Loong's May Day Rally speech today ‚Äì his last major one as prime minister.https://str.sg/A3oe,btohqsg
true but china is opening conflict on two fronts..they also have done the same to regions between china and india,btohqsg
now its possible every country have their own motives   including Ukraine neighbours too,btohqsg
yea the motives of these other neighbours are unclear but the motives of china is very clear.China used the Convention of Peking as reasoning for renaming these cities citing that it was a unequal treaty forced upon by Britain to hand over the territories after the Qing dynasty fell.The Convention was a result of the second opium war where britain wanted china to legalise opium trading but the Dynasty of the time would not..hence they invaded.,btohqsg
Actually its quite the same some of ukrainian territories historically belong to their neighbours,btohqsg
i mean..its all under treaties  the problem is some countries will never recognise certain treatiesWhether its a believe it was forced upon them or they had no other way,btohqsg
opium war wasn't UK plan to grab land?,btohqsg
the main aim was to legalise opium in china so it can become a trading commodity which the british believe would benefit both economies.The Qing Dynasty leaders believed opium was bad  the british valued their economy over the well being of people. So they launched a attack into China to force them into accepting their terms to legalise opium.Because of both the first and second opium war  the Qing Dynasty had to signed over vast amount of chinese land to other nations. China has always wanted to gain back these areas and they have been slowly gaining it back slowly.Mainland hong kong was signed to the british after the first opium warKowloon was signed to the brtish after the second opium warBoth Kowloon and Hong Kong were handed over to china in 1999 and 1997 respectively,btohqsg
Not when he plays loh kean yew,btohqsg
No la I asked her for her notes to read cuz I needed to clarify one part of her syllabus doc,btohqsg
Cuz im mentoring some h1 student from ej rn and the ej notes are fking confusing for that chapter so I asked for tm notes in hopes it's better,btohqsg
Apparantly rhey just didn't cover that whole portion,btohqsg
U R asking for too much my guy,btohqsg
And ej tj and dh use the same set of notes,btohqsg
So the only option I have left is hci,btohqsg
No hci is questionable cause they,btohqsg
Eh what?? I tot TM notes q good sia,btohqsg
The content is at least in the notes,btohqsg
I just disagree with the way that it's taught,btohqsg
Because to me the way irs phrased its fking stupid,btohqsg
Ya did u mix up  maybe h1 dh then ej teach extra,btohqsg
No it's in the syllabus document,btohqsg
It's he compare w sylla doc,btohqsg
Plus I asked the other geog cher,btohqsg
Wait send the message ur cher sent,btohqsg
I think this aspect not fully addresed yet but in next or next next weeks HBL we will give this set and upload the lectureThanks for being so sharp hehe,btohqsg
Chao ni ma eh H1 not supp to have HBL stuff HAHAHAAHA,btohqsg
I low-key scared of her also,btohqsg
I not in the mood to deal w her shit,btohqsg
Brw there's alot of studf in ur notes not in syllabus anymore,btohqsg
Like the Urban as an entity and quality,btohqsg
And the reasons and variations for global trends in urbanization,btohqsg
NO WONDER I NVR FEEL LIKE IT GET TESTED ONE,btohqsg
Idk why they focus on reasons,btohqsg
The syllabus document asked for effects...,btohqsg
If u see ur syllabus document  the second big point is smth likePopulation challenges faced by cities in achieving SD- High urbanization rates and urban speawl- declining urban populations,btohqsg
How do they affect the pursuit of countries in achieving SUD,btohqsg
Dude at this pt u can create your own notes and sell it LOL,btohqsg
So u must link to the idea of needs limits and trade offs,btohqsg
It's not rly in the notes from ur sch,btohqsg
Feels like this got covered in the notes,btohqsg
Cuz ur sch focus mainly on the reasons why got these trends,btohqsg
But challenges placed on the dimensions due to population pressures is not,btohqsg
And this one can come out as essay qn,btohqsg
Cuz the issues in sud are all manifestations of the imbalance between demand and supply,btohqsg
Ya I alrd can think of the points roughly,btohqsg
SO u can just link everything to issues in sud,btohqsg
Time to be an asshole and kinda gatekeep this info,btohqsg
Yea btr pray no other tmjcians see this esp not within a public chat,btohqsg
And take h1 geog this yr,btohqsg
I raised this all up to the geog department head in ej,btohqsg
if u can oni choose one,btohqsg
"""Actually it's quite badly written la""",btohqsg
"""So i tell my students to ignore LOL""",btohqsg
He talking abt the ej notes,btohqsg
Tbf this is cause he got beef with the geog cher who wrote this portion of the notes,btohqsg
"i rmb in poly there was a presentation on ""ways to reduce waste in singapore""..my bright mind gave the suggestion  make floating garbage trucks so that waste can be collected and driven over to semakau and dumped and did not need to wait for a barge to travel from semakau and mainland on a time interval...quickening the turnover rate of garbage...Not realising that this does not reduce waste  just quicken waste removal",btohqsg
Tbf this always happens when there's a new syllabus,btohqsg
Damn funny eh me and my friend we're just like,btohqsg
Do yall think singapore will ever implement these trucks for garbage removal,btohqsg
cause to get trash from mainland to semakau..they need to wait to feel up these,btohqsg
the real question is: is bedok counted?,btohqsg
tbh if I don't get into any of the unis I applied to I have no idea where to go liao,btohqsg
my choices would pretty much come down to SIM or grind moon runes to go to Japan,btohqsg
my grades and portfolio aren't good enough for uk/us and I have no talent for German,btohqsg
tbf uk/us probs can but then won't be like your v big name unis,btohqsg
too ex  and besides I'm going to overseas uni to live overseas,btohqsg
but anw regardless of whr u go for uni,btohqsg
u can still migrate to another country afterwards,btohqsg
i wld suggest u just apply for unis in the countries u want to go to,btohqsg
what's your definition of not good enough such that you don't even want to try applying,btohqsg
(also JP companies tend to prefer people who grad from JP unis),btohqsg
UK/US is mostly a cost thing  tbh,btohqsg
US uni costs are insane  UK COL has gone mad,btohqsg
also getting US residency is literally a lottery,btohqsg
u hv japanese language certification alr?,btohqsg
JLPT? not yet  wonder if I should go all-in on doing exam prep for JLPT N3 if I don't get in,btohqsg
i mean if you're dead set on japan only and not even considering countries then might as well start prepping for that and also start applying to their unis whenever they open,btohqsg
eh i wld ask what course and what score but,btohqsg
i wld say just apply regardless,btohqsg
unless you don't have the money for application fee,btohqsg

if english/EEE/engineering was your first 3 choices u muight have more hope,btohqsg

been using PRC uni advice as a rough substitute (similar  if not harder  difficulty over there)  most PRC advisors suggest Japan  UK  US  AUS and Germany,btohqsg

PRC ppl are flooding SG unis for a reason,btohqsg

US less so because US=ivy league,btohqsg
