Dbs wwmc bonus pts cutoff is it by transaction or posting date?,btohqsg
Okie. Thanks so much. I‚Äôll go apply the 365 card for Sep use Liao. üòäüëç,btohqsg
So the $50 from spend bonus includes the extra rebates?,btohqsg
For this video  Chris recco live + specifically for food and dining  but if the person can‚Äôt hit the $600 minimum spend then also no used right,btohqsg
no the rebate from credit card will not be shown in savings acct it will be a separate credit card rebate,btohqsg
No 600 for that month then no used for the entire quarter (except for the quarter you open the acct),btohqsg
How about OCBC  Would using OCBC visa card link to cardup qualify for the $500 spend?,btohqsg
I would think yes with the right card but I never tried before,btohqsg
Is it possible to get the Citi Prestige card without hitting the min. Income Level and using ur fixed Deposit as colleteral?,btohqsg
But not sure what‚Äôs the current FD amount. Previously was 10k  but if they follow UOB for 120k cards  might be 30k FD,btohqsg
May have to check with Citi. Milelion said 15k while suitemiles said 10k. And I can't find any info on Citi website,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if UOB lady and UOB ppv calculate bonus miles cap based on posted date or transaction date? If I make transactions on 31 Aug  will these go into Aug or Sep quota? Thanks!,btohqsg
Means the bonus miles calculations won‚Äôt hit August quota because it takes few days to reflect the transactions (which goes into Sept) yea?,btohqsg
My bad. Posted date so September. Unless merchant posts same date which happened.,btohqsg

Yes  highest possible for 3.5k spend already sir.,btohqsg
How about cashback cards for travel related expenses like hotels  activities via klook? Which cashback cards are good?,btohqsg
Cashback card doesn't cater well to travel category like klook. May consider getting klook vouchers from heymax  which is coded as 5311 department store. Have more cashback card option for that.,btohqsg
I see. Are there any miles cards that are good for klook?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc and uob lady travel. If go via heymax  options are endless.,btohqsg
I see. Im new to heymax  will need to figure that out first. Haha,btohqsg

Anyone buy things off of iHerb recently/frequently?First time buying from them  but having issues placing the order. I tried two different credit cards  PayPal  Apple Pay  Google Pay. All of them they will deduct my card  then I will receive email that my order is cancelled due to error processing my payment details  then I immediately receive a refund to my card.Cards tried:MariBankAmazeSCB Simply CashCIMB World MastercardTrust Card,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check  can citi presitge fee be waived?,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony.  But I would like to know it is worth to use credit card on overseas spending with 3.25% FX rate to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
What cards do you own? Can't comment without knowing,btohqsg
if you have 4mpd mastercard  it's clear cut to pair with amaze for lower fee.,btohqsg
see if you need to clock spending for monthly spend  and perhaps it's specialised category it depends if you value cashflow and the reward from the transactions over saving FX rate by using cash or multicurrency debit cards.,btohqsg
Hey thanks so much for the link is there one for savings accounts?,btohqsg
There are less high interest saving accts. Plus  each acct having different interests depends on how many categories you can qualify. To name a few  UOB one  ocbc 360  HSBC EGA  standard chartered esaver  BOC smart saver  GXS  Maribank  etc.,btohqsg
