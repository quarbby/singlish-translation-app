just read the simba T&C  8gb is include promotional free 4gb  so after that might be 4gb only,btohqsg
Specifically MY130..Its targeted for msia use..,btohqsg
ohh  then this one is really chiong msia very often?,btohqsg
Bro its just $10/mth lolNo often also nvm,btohqsg
First 3 months is $10/mthAfter that will be $13/mthStill dirt cheap..Local use is 100gb leh,btohqsg
actually i do consider getting another data only sim for my food delivery use. And maybe next time reservist can spend in bunk.,btohqsg
TPG is the cheapest data only use still lol,btohqsg
And they have improved alot since the starting days.. I been using it as my secondary line for past 4years,btohqsg
so even for normal user  MY130 is more worth it?,btohqsg
So TPG MY130 is for those who already want a second sim who might go msia once in a while or few very short trips.And Redone is for something who is doing extended long trip in msia within a month but dont need extra data in SG.,btohqsg
Now tpg is called simba if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I scared i say simba many dunno wtf it is lol,btohqsg
I used Amex to topup GPC and looks like I reached 5K per day limit. In this case  should I wait 24hrs is it? Is there any other card providing cash back for GPC other than Amex and UOB? Pls adviseI am thinking of topup using my spouse GPC via Amex but unfortunately the limit is per credit card not only for the per GPC.,btohqsg
The only other card is AMEX Highflyer  which I don't have it yet. Need a registered business UEN,btohqsg
Anyway regarding the Malaysia SIM card.Previously I was using OneXOX for 28 months  now I'm using SIMBA $10  before the SIMBA 130 was announced. So I'm looking to switch but they can't change it unless you port to a new telco and port back. So I'm just keeping SIMBA 10 for now,btohqsg
Anyone know if using UOB One credit card for town council payments quality for monthly spend? Planning to make payment monthly. (~$200),btohqsg
I tried this longtime back and this was not quality for the monthly spent.. may be need to check someone if they use recently?,btohqsg
Not sure whether itâ€™s still worth to apply amex cashback or UOB cashback grabpay top up?,btohqsg
You are probably still gonna use it for payments to insurances and services via AXS,btohqsg
Hmm. The grabpay top via amex will not earn me points in grabpay anymore right?,btohqsg
Not a big impact actually. Those who are already using CC for grab in-app purchases will still be using CC.Grabpay wallet is a totally different ball game,btohqsg
Shopee cannot use credit card topup liaoUnless pay $1 admin fee per topupSo now use paynow :(,btohqsg
Hi all. Just to check top up gpmc with amex still will have cashback right for the credit card? I'm abit confuse abt the grabpay thing now,btohqsg
So basically if payment using gpmc no points lah issit,btohqsg
No  only no points if you use other credit cards on grab services.,btohqsg
Maybe I should do a Grabpay video,btohqsg
hopefully got jipay replacement come soon  helped me a lot to win the grab reward challenges as a student bcos can just transfer to ezlink mc,btohqsg
If top up gpmc with amex got cashback and I still earn point using gpmc then I ok already ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Seems like a lot people use GPMC.. haha,btohqsg
can anyone teach me about crypto i have watch the vid but im still abit unsure,btohqsg
Learn yrself. Youtube so many video.,btohqsg
"Its a big ass topic... Also u need to be more specific when asking for help...Imagine how you would response if u hear your other half say ""help me  i'm in pain'... What would u do or bring along? First aid box  ambulance  doctor  or surgeon?",btohqsg
like when do i need to sell?,btohqsg
Hihiie   wish to check whats the best card to use when going malaysia/ jb ?,btohqsg
Youtrip/revolut. And touch and go e wallet,btohqsg
What is the fee for withdrawing usd into multi currency acc,btohqsg
you should get financial advisor if u r vested and asking these qns,btohqsg
YouTrip you cannot transfer the money to bank. Any ovs ATM withdrawal is 5% fee.Revolut has 1% weekend fee when you spend on weekend. But you can do ATM withdraw up to $350 a month with no fee from revolut  afterward is 2%.I donâ€™t go msia much  and didnâ€™t know anything about touch and go much.,btohqsg
if you already have master debit or credit card. can just get amaze card and link them to the card and use ovs,btohqsg
No requirement. Can check them out at their websitehttps://www.instarem.com/en-sg/,btohqsg
Now they just rolled out Visa card topup to spend. not sure how that works,btohqsg
cause im only 18 so im really not sure on how to start n lots of stuff but i wanna try it out,btohqsg
Anyone tried tiger cash plus? Im having issues subscribing,btohqsg
anyone know top up kopitiam card is under what MCC?,btohqsg
I think u better ask tiger support.,btohqsg
No one spoon fed you. Yr qn too general. You can go learn from some youtuber in crypto space or investing. I believe there is ton of website available too.,btohqsg
I suggest stay away from crypto for the time being  learn the basics of long term investing first  youtubers like Daniel Pronk is good at explaining fundamental analysis,btohqsg
I started investing at 18 too few years ago  good to start early,btohqsg
Hmmmâ€¦ MYR exchange rate on instarem is 3.216  YouTrip is 3.226  3% difference,btohqsg
MYR on revolut today is 3.23x,btohqsg
