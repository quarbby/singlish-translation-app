has anyone visited nami island bfr ? is it worth gg,btohqsg
Anyone know why i cannot post in SGExams? Post gets auto removed,btohqsg
ur post most likely got removed by auto-mod's anti filtering on r/sgexams1. iirc  u must meet a minimum quota of200 Words / Charactersin ur post2. there's also a differentiation of academic & non-academic posts on weekdays & weekends  but nt v sure on this subject,btohqsg
u can check with the reddit mods,btohqsg
did u add flair (tags)if not  then it's probably an issue with reddit's end,btohqsg
such stuff happens a lot with the platform nowadays,btohqsg
do know Engineering is not the be-all and end all.It is the soft skills that you learnt along the way. 😂,btohqsg
weird polls on SG Ask Everyone,btohqsg
Maybe u keep yapping in ur post lol,btohqsg
She's referring to posting in the sgexams reddit my guy,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure there's no other subreddits like SGExams (correct me if I'm wrong),btohqsg
Hi  is there a way for me to contact the sgexams subreddit moderators?,btohqsg
My post from a while ago was removed  I sent the mods a message and didn’t get a reply,btohqsg
For me SGExams works just fine so yea,btohqsg
I was thinking they could have telegram and be in this chat,btohqsg
I genuinely don’t know what was wrong with my post,btohqsg
It was a rant about my family  there was nothing potentially inappropriate in it,btohqsg
And it was posted on a weekend if that matters,btohqsg
No there are people who post about random rant as well,btohqsg
They allow non-academic posts on weekends,btohqsg
And sometimes non-acad rants are allowed on weekdays too,btohqsg
Though not always  they don’t seem consistent on this,btohqsg
Mine isn’t a r/s post though,btohqsg
Ite course results are supposed to release at 9am,btohqsg
Now its 12am and i alrdy got an email about course acceptance?,btohqsg
And its like my last choice,btohqsg
Does that mean thats the only course im offered or will there be more results shown at 9am?,btohqsg
bro.. i got accepted into a course i didn't apply for ☠️,btohqsg
Cuz rlly my 9 to 12th choice dam shit,btohqsg
go to Self Services > Student Admission > Application Resultsyou'll enter a page called View Application Results,btohqsg
Bruh legit got my 11th choice sia,btohqsg
Is there a chance that more offers will show up at 9am?,btohqsg
i don't think so  it's not like EAE ( early admission exercise ),btohqsg
but anyways we have until this friday  3 Jan 2025 to make a decision,btohqsg
Idk bruh im js so shocked rn,btohqsg
Like i got 21 for n,btohqsg
Since dpp cut off is 19 i thought that 21 is a good enough score most for higher nitec courses,btohqsg
Especially since most of my most desired choices are ones where the requirement is to simply finish N lvl,btohqsg
Like srsly 1 to 10th all cannot with a fucking 21,btohqsg
I wld expect smth like that if i got like 24 or below but not fucking 21,btohqsg
and i think dpp had their offers separately done,btohqsg
my brother received his way earlier,btohqsg
idk why bro chose to apply for the campus all the at the west when we're like at the east side,btohqsg
especially since he did pretty well for his N(A)s,btohqsg
he got raw 13 for EMB3meanwhile my EMB2 in 2023 was 13 🌚,btohqsg
When did he get his results?,btohqsg
specifically not too long after the cut-off period to apply for ITE courses,btohqsg
Ok but is it common for someone to be offered more than 1 course?,btohqsg
Feel like for O levels  answer would have been no. So  I presume it would be same for dpp also for n levels,btohqsg
Alright then i wanna appeal like rn,btohqsg
