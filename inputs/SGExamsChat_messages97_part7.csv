Can go search up the paper 19/20 Sem 1,btohqsg
On the math soc website for MA1102R,btohqsg
I‚Äôll see when I finish all the tutorials,btohqsg
Tutorial difficulty v far from actual finals,btohqsg
To be fair our tutorials were quite hard as well,btohqsg
Even the Part II questions in the tutorial?,btohqsg
Part 1 qns are easy compared to the finals,btohqsg
Looked at the epsilon delta tutorial,btohqsg
And the one in the finals,btohqsg
But calculus there are mainly some easy questions,btohqsg
It's only towards the end where it gets hard,btohqsg
im tryna do an elasticity qn but holy fk am i getting myself confused,btohqsg
U know where to go for help,btohqsg
Wait  was tan half angle sub a trick taught in the module itself,btohqsg
holy fk its like u understand elasticities,btohqsg
BUT THEN nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO U CANT APPLY IT,btohqsg
If not it would have been really unreasonable,btohqsg
It was in the examples he gave,btohqsg
john smith what did u teach,btohqsg
Actually i think 1 of the prof taught while the other didnt really teach it explicitly,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a 50% chance that you‚Äôd learn what you needed for that Q8,btohqsg
Well the other prof did in 1 of the examples i guess,btohqsg
But she didnt teach it that explicitly,btohqsg
No no dont touch me there. This is my nono square - JS probably,btohqsg
Didn't know of a half tangent thingy,btohqsg
I fEeL sO l O o P y,btohqsg
Oh the tangent sub is really cool,btohqsg
Owao dat geometry question is really cute,btohqsg
That can be set in a level,btohqsg
No point trying to force people to close book if its at home,btohqsg
I'd assume the test is harder?,btohqsg
just imagining you frantically uploading the exam paper on stack exchange,btohqsg
It‚Äôs pretty rare to see J1 papers uploaded online,btohqsg
Yea how to enforce close book exam at home,btohqsg
Did they set the paper harder tho,btohqsg
For my mods yea somewhat harder,btohqsg
They will minimise qns where u can directly copy off notes/easily google online,btohqsg
You can always add in big 2,btohqsg
Probably not the best choice atm because I cant give accurate answers as compared to last yr üëâüèªüëàüèª,btohqsg
