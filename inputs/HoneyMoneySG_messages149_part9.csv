I think I worked out before. It was actually quite an ‚Äúok‚Äù miles buying deal.,btohqsg
With all the questions I actually went to dig dig dig. It seems ok woh! Why? Because of the 5 or 6 miles bonus u get on 5% of mab.If u plonk $300k cash into krisflyer account. U can earn max of 15 000 miles per month from spend bonus (on top of usual credit card spend)Sweet spot is:$2500 spend per month with salary credit$3000 spend per month without salary creditI might do it myself. Once again this demonstrates sharing is caring. I try to answer questions and go dig dig dig. End up I benefit myself.Thanks all.,btohqsg
This is fake la.I would treat it as 180k miles x 1.5 cents = $2 700 value.The other big component is the 4 months of 15k bonus = 60k miles or $900 valueOn top of your usual miles on the card used.$3600 / $300 000 for 4 months = 3.6% pa.It‚Äôs fairly decent especially if u feel savings account rates will be coming down.Heck even HSBC EGA is 4.1% now only.,btohqsg
This is the highest and most worth it tier.However I noticed a big auxiliary benefit to doing this.Your krisflyer debit card can earn 5 miles per dollar if u maintain $300k adb.,btohqsg
And HSBC ega rate already went down.,btohqsg
Still got 3.8% la. But of course can go down again‚Ä¶. Hahaha,btohqsg
Hmmm dont think it's worth it at all  considering we can get miles easily.,btohqsg
in this case it makes sense to only pay $1964.83 per month to cardup  the excess $1035.17 paynow directly to landlord. effective cashback of 1.05%,btohqsg
It is partially due to merchant. If merchant don‚Äôt submit  nothing you as customer can do.,btohqsg
I had this  acct and had 30k inside.Just collect miles every month from this acct  and transfer out the funds when I am done with,btohqsg
Can I buy a phone as installment while clocking minimum spending?,btohqsg
Via bank installment  most likely no.,btohqsg
Did u work out the effective benefit level / rate?,btohqsg
Yes.Miles rewarded is 5% of your MABIf you had 20k in acct . Then u be awarded 1000 miles,btohqsg
But u don‚Äôt get paid any cash interest. So was it worth it?As a comparison if the $30k cash was put into HSBC EGA at 3.8% pa now it could have earned you $95 a month,btohqsg
It all depends on what u after right?The acct is 0.05% interest PA. If u are after $$. Then this acct will not work for u,btohqsg
And there won't be best of both worlds,btohqsg
Alternate between EGA with KF uob acc is an alternative probably.,btohqsg
You need to spend on eligible cards to be given miles up to 5% of your MAB. Just parking money won't get miles,btohqsg
Unless your KF for the fresh fund promo which give miles for earmarking your money for 3 months,btohqsg
I got a question to ask. Currently my giro payment to credit card is paying by my UOB one account. What should I do to stop the giro before I setting up through payment by my EGA account,btohqsg
just setup giro with hsbc ega  the banks will do the change,btohqsg
I am using the KF CC as well.So far had been using it. And haven tried not using to see if the miles are still credited or not,btohqsg
Any idea what‚Äôs the the best card to use with Kris+?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Generic online cards like dbs wwmc or amaze + crmc (no travel). Else  UOB KF without restrictions.,btohqsg
$30k get extra 1 500 miles? Means $95/1 500 =$0.06 cpm üò±,btohqsg
yes  but usually merchants submit  it's UOB that doesn't post on sundays and PH,btohqsg
Ikr hence my friendly query but met with hostile response. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Does the uob lady's card 5$ dollar blocks is total of the month or single transaction,btohqsg
Anyone else know. Some people say per transaction some say per month total up,btohqsg
Base is per transaction  bonus is total transactions.,btohqsg
Search ‚ÄúLady $5‚Äù or read TnC? If two persons replied you with two different answers  you will end up confuse too again.,btohqsg
UoB LS with correct mcc   can?,btohqsg
For SCB smart card  how long it take to update the reward points? I only need 80 more points to redeem my next block of $10 but the update was like almost 1 month ago....,btohqsg
Hi there I'm currently looking for low risk instruments  that gives about 4%to 4.5% return annualized  but monthly basis. Any of such example?,btohqsg
Most likely the bonus will be delayed till April.,btohqsg
my points stopped updating since 16 dec :')i think we can try to calculate it on our own. it's a little confusing tbh  because at the start of each month it's +XXXX. can try to backtrack,btohqsg
Endowus and most platform have. If not can buy from ur bank RMs,btohqsg
Yes. Used many times for dining.,btohqsg
Hi. I opened a UOB one joint account with my wife.For the salary credit  does it still work if I credit 1600 via Paynow to her phone number which is now linked to this new account?,btohqsg
Hi Folks  any recommendation for Ireland-based ETF that tracks S&P509?,btohqsg

Hi all  for citibank rewards - does $1 spending (base reward) both card equate to 1 point for redemption ? Thanks.,btohqsg
For context  is the usage of the term 1 mile and 1 point interchangeable for citibank ?,btohqsg
Citi has 2 currencies. One is Citi miles  which is 1 Citi mile eq 1 airline mile. Second is thank you points  which 2.5 thank you points is equal to 1 miles.,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1$ on eligible transaction will get 10 thank you points  or 4 miles.,btohqsg
Citi is confusing because have multiple currencies that are not pooled and not same ratio. üëéüèª,btohqsg
Hi experts  anyone knows if the airport limo transfer rebate for Citi Prestige (assuming I clocked $12k per quarter) includes the cost of child seats?It's amazing that each child seat costs $27 additional,btohqsg
Hi. I want to know how to make best use of citi rewards card,btohqsg
