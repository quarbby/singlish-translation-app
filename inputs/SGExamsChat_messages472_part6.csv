Doesn’t need to be AI per se but for example  grammarly is good on an individual level  but if employed on a mass scale can create personalized correction and improvement recommendations for submitted essays,btohqsg
It is all if-else statement  just more in a complicated form.,btohqsg
So if you run an English tuition center and digitize your submissions  you can prove to parents and students certain metrics of what you can deliver,btohqsg
right now if you built any AI you’re just assimilating the largest repertoire of questions  and i don’t see something being able to build on students intuition that well anytime soon (physics pov),btohqsg
Identifying weaknesses is tougher.Eg weak in Electromagnetism chapter may be due to weaknesses in concepts of Dynamics or Forces  which are the foundation to the topic,btohqsg
If you look at those digital websites  on how they have a 'question bank'  the problem structure is always the same  with numbers different.,btohqsg
For sure  AI cant do this.,btohqsg
may also be weak in forming explanation questions  not because of concepts  but because of the way it is phrased  and the order in which it is phrased,btohqsg
can still talk about A level haha,btohqsg
Doesn’t need an AI to do it  just takes a standardized test designed by (perhaps yourself) which isolates these facts and shows where they need improvement,btohqsg
may also be handwriting dependent for some studentsor poor/wrong data extractionor just plain careless mistakes,btohqsg
The language stuff definitely needs language models to scale,btohqsg
different. Students may perform differently in an actual exam situation,btohqsg
why are we discussing this so boomer-ily,btohqsg
I think jun Wei is an actual boomer and I’m almost 30,btohqsg
i am teaching others how to be boomer,btohqsg
This is more of like a baseline reading. At hospitals when you come in they take your vitals  in the same way students have their academic vitals taken by a test you design to touch briefly on all the core A level topics that scale in difficulty  and you know what they’re weak at or strong atZ,btohqsg
i’m thinking but even if you could build an AI to do this  getting it to the point where it’s accuracy is trustworthy enough is smth i don’t foresee atm  with everything trained being a black box anyway,btohqsg
I seeing if I don’t want to work any more can I become tuition teacher,btohqsg
studying teaching and working all at once,btohqsg
so ure preying on young kids,btohqsg
I got a friend whose is rs like toxic and she dont know what to do. Her bf keeps saying he want to break up but she don't want,btohqsg
it only say CBT so i not sure,btohqsg
More of their parents money but yes,btohqsg
my wife  take blood pressure at home and at clinic  at home normal  at clinic become high blood pressure,btohqsg
why do you always find yourself in these situations,btohqsg
so we bought a totally new blood pressure machine in case the old one had problems  and it was the same result,btohqsg
Haha fair enough  but academics is also about stress management so you know  that’s another differentiator right. Some teachers can rly motivate and captivate and others can’t.,btohqsg
if one side really don’t want then no point trying to force it,btohqsg
she can stay stuck to it by all means,btohqsg
In summary  the human factor which cannot be easily replicated by AI for the foreseeable future,btohqsg
love is blind doesnt actually exist when u grow up,btohqsg
like imma be real even if two people really love each other  it doesn’t mean it always works out,btohqsg
yah but imagine begging to stay with someone who dont even want u,btohqsg
My angle is to push for more automated and digitized learning tools  not so much to replace the educator but empower,btohqsg
But good points you made  and you come from a place of experience so thanks for sharing,btohqsg
I understand. I don't mind sharing more if there is a push in this area. But then again  in terms of such credentials  MOE HQ will always be better.,btohqsg
Psh  if my business strategy is to make a software platform that does all this the last place I will go to is the government,btohqsg
Better to go to a tuition agency with a large reach like Kumon and then pitch  then sell a subscription model,btohqsg
Geniebook is trying to position itself as an AI learning tool  but I think it is mostly an if-else statements tool,btohqsg
They have strong financial backing  and not my issue anyway haha,btohqsg
There is also another one from China  Spark Education,btohqsg
I mean if one is not working  I dont know how can others work.,btohqsg
I think massive funding from Tencent and other China companies recently,btohqsg
It just looks like your typical online course platform at first glance,btohqsg
I am planning to do an online course platform  simple one. Don't need so complicated. May take 2 years though.,btohqsg
Thanks. Planning to use it to replace me  while also addressing all the potential pitfalls and problems I foresee on students using the other platforms.But bootstrapping  so going to take time.,btohqsg
I think he meant revenue < costs at the moment,btohqsg
I think focusing on the human aspects is still important for education.,btohqsg
If you have multiple such telegram forums  how are you gonna survive?,btohqsg
