what's the difference between a powerslide and a drift uh ?,btohqsg
powerslide is when the car got power then slide,btohqsg
drift is when the car drifts away from itâ€™s trajectory,btohqsg

nvm nothing already Hahaha rayyan came to the rescue,btohqsg
powersliding is having the rear end stepping out on exit,btohqsg
drift is initiating the slide before the apex,btohqsg
basically if you have shit tyres on a rwd  you kick the rears out on exit it's a powerslide,btohqsg
but if you're having some opposite lock before the apex  that's technically a drift,btohqsg
