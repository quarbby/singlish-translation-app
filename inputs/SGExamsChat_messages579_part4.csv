the chers will talk abt the students,btohqsg
like so and so is xxx,btohqsg
maybe ur just damn lowkey and lucky enough to have stayed that way,btohqsg
in ej the chers are q close to the students,btohqsg
lol my class had no drama,btohqsg
bro class drama is so overrated,btohqsg
I feel like genuinely speaking the more bonded a class is the better the performance in A Levels,btohqsg
i am very close to hating that cunt,btohqsg
The thing abt ur batch is they used me to go places and when they were done they just stopped,btohqsg
he got in through his connections w u,btohqsg
or dumped work on u or what,btohqsg
He passed his probation cuz of me,btohqsg
honestly my class too many chs council boys,btohqsg
And he got into trip sci cuz of me (I pulled too many strngs),btohqsg
i didnt even believe he was from chs council till my other chs friend said so,btohqsg
since when do students have influence over subject combis,btohqsg
he got into a programme that allowed him to get trip sci,btohqsg
i pulled him into the programme,btohqsg
only for him to take h1 math now and flunk his other subjects pfft,btohqsg
yk my class made an instagram acc just for him,btohqsg
cause he always sleeps in class,btohqsg
every single day every single lesson,btohqsg
okay but anyways in general ej ulti kids are,btohqsg
can i ask a dumb question,btohqsg
he dropped and convinced half my class to drop too,btohqsg
how many of yall above 18 rdy,btohqsg
more than half the people here at least,btohqsg
(initially 25 but 6 people left sch/retain),btohqsg
normally thats what yall would drop to h1,btohqsg
but the h2 geog students are q strong generally in geog,btohqsg
then out of 19 we have 9 taking h1 math,btohqsg
he takes the exact same combi as me,btohqsg
ok la in his case i can see why he wouldnt wanna drop h2 lit,btohqsg
its too easy and so little content and hes a slacker,btohqsg
(easy provided u have the skills already and he pretty much does),btohqsg
instead of dropping h2 geog or h2 hist,btohqsg
is his lit gdin chs it was like meh,btohqsg
in arnd 150 days'll be 18,btohqsg
he writes notable essays every now and then,btohqsg
but h2 lit is 6 essays and hes not getting an A if he only writes 1 or 2 good essays,btohqsg
i judge someones intellectual capability by their ability to do gp,btohqsg
gp i cant say about anyone in my cohort,btohqsg
but whether they will get A in A levels...,btohqsg
I think my 3 classes each class i shud be able to get minimally 5As,btohqsg
minimally 5 is pretty good imo,btohqsg
especially with u as their cher,btohqsg
ngl now i wanna know if other feeder jcs are just as petty as eunoian jip kids,btohqsg
in that 3 months i pulled one class msg from 3.2 to 2.2,btohqsg
why never teach my class ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i think hes a v nice person and cher,btohqsg
