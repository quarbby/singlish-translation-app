Well  u have to care less,btohqsg
it's not as easy as you say man,btohqsg
Its more important not being an asshole than what u stick on a car,btohqsg
I mean in your case its work,btohqsg
You dont pull up for an interview in an itasha and expects people to treat you seriously,btohqsg
Just make sure ur design is tasteful then,btohqsg
I think how u carry yourself for the first few sentences is more important,btohqsg
That's what i thought also la,btohqsg
But in this society it's not that easy,btohqsg
We're taught not to judge people by the cover,btohqsg
as much as i try to deny,btohqsg
2 ways to read this: this guy cant be taken seriously because he puts his favorite anime on his car. OrThis guy has confidence off the charts to put his favorite anime on his car,btohqsg
"Most people they see is ""this guy watch anime ah  cfm is some small kid that can't be taken seriously""",btohqsg
it's what people have told me,btohqsg
They even tell me the way i dress looks like an intern,btohqsg
U know what boomers (people even older than me with kids in sec sch) tell me?,btohqsg
"""dont judge a book by it's cover"" LOL",btohqsg
“Eh thats the netflix anime! Thats your favorite character ah?”,btohqsg
It depends on the people you meet also la,btohqsg
Rich ass millionaires you think they think that way meh,btohqsg
or issit those HDB play pokemon go people,btohqsg
It can also be your answer,btohqsg
The rich people are more judgemental than other people,btohqsg
Its up to you how u want to carry it,btohqsg
You just need to get more exposed to them la,btohqsg
I buy that because u front office there is some difference,btohqsg
It doesn't even matter if my car has an anime girl on it or not,btohqsg
But i dont buy that it will affect your sales unless u do something lewd or distasteful,btohqsg
if i drive up in a base model euro cars,btohqsg
Well then. It doesnt fucking matter any more then does it,btohqsg
it's a matter of how seriously they wanna treat you,btohqsg
Perhaps one thing they will recognize is that the artwork is not cheap,btohqsg
anything you say will just fly over their head,btohqsg
you can speak like a lawyer,btohqsg
just cos you dont look the part,btohqsg
You can look like a lawyer but speaks like an ahbeng,btohqsg
they also will take you seriously,btohqsg
"they think ""wah this guy cfm alot of experience on the streets""",btohqsg
We can talk round the moon bro  if u dont wanna do it u will have reasons not to,btohqsg
If u wanna do it u can,btohqsg
honestly this is probably the best solution,btohqsg
A Koenigsseg Agera to be taken seriously in and then your Miata Itasha,btohqsg
I really thinking what happens if i pull up in a Ferrari itasha,btohqsg
Probably still respect but some questions before business,btohqsg
They will also ask if ferrari sent u any letters,btohqsg
Sometimes i really think if i'm working for somebody in an office  i'd probably have an itasha by now,btohqsg
But it's very hard if i'm the face of the company.,btohqsg
Actually i drive miata already kena judged already,btohqsg
U reach a point where people first impression of u is “this guy doesnt care what i think of him”,btohqsg
Its a kind of respect also bro,btohqsg
