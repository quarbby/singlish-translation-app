Hello  how long does it take to get confirmation for joining EGA bonus interest promo after sending thr SMS to them to sign up? I sent kn Saturday but still no confirmation SMS or email received back,btohqsg
Saturday is a non working day so they might send it today instead,btohqsg
Yes hotel wedding. What about DBS altitude card?,btohqsg
Whats the best way or card to pay for Grab transport/food overseas (say in thailand)?,btohqsg
Quite sure its instarem + citi rewards,btohqsg
Thanks!What are the 2nd and 3rd best way?Sorry dont have citi rewards card ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Is it suppose to be 0amaze pts when using it overseas for grab ? I bind amaze card (crmc)to grab but so far did not see any amaze pts,btohqsg
to get the pts  u need to use the amaze card directly sirðŸ«¡,btohqsg
u won't earn any amaze points for local spends. Grab mcc is 4121  which is not excluded herehttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
10sgd above transaction then will get points,btohqsg
he talking about Amaze points  dun think Citi rewards TnC is relevant,btohqsg
when u don't see any points  are u using the card locally  or overseas?,btohqsg
Yea overseas. My bad  din know the 10sgd min.,btohqsg
probably not above $10 as pointed out by Chris,btohqsg
In thailand and malaysia can use airasia rides instead of grab  sometimes much cheaper,btohqsg
Amaze+Maybank family and friends (transport category) for Grab ride,btohqsg
The card game just make me headache.everytime.need to think what to use local and overseas. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
My preferred cards for overseas usage is a combination of OCBC Frank and Maybank FnF. Does not apply for large payments though.,btohqsg
Hi  gurus   Iâ€™m new here  may I know I can add my sc Manhattan master to interam and use my amaze card to pay online foreign currency purchases? If do so  can get instapoint ? Thanks,btohqsg
yes  provided MCC not excluded.If paying in Jun  can make use of the 4x instapoint promo. Top up Amaze wallet using mastercard  use Amaze wallet make payment. No rewards on the mastercard though.,btohqsg
does CRMC give rewards to GRAB or GOJEK ?,btohqsg
^ yes to taxi rides/food  no to topups,btohqsg
This 1 spend with any cc is pooled right? E.g. everyday card and yuu card spending total per mth?,btohqsg
OCBC 360 interest is in today! those that tracks the 500 increase closely and need to transfer out better do it now.,btohqsg
For me I saw only the â€œsave bonus â€œ is in from some reason. Canâ€™t see the rest,btohqsg
That is true but depends on timing. I find it gd to use during grab urge period. Can save up to 7RM. per trip.,btohqsg
that's weird I can see salary and cc spend bonus too,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not using the card. But salary is in every month..,btohqsg
That is why the Max card is a potential game changer product to solve all these problems:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/100892,btohqsg
Yea but it also may become 1compromise lead to all your cards and with 3rd party . It's a hassle if ever shit happen,btohqsg
"the ""miles"" in this case is not the usual miles right? at this point we don't know what 1 mile is equivalent to I think.",btohqsg
Based on the FAQ: Max Miles can be pooled and converted at an approximate 1:1 ratio into air miles for dozens of the world's leading airlines and hotels. Alternatively  you can redeem them for cash at a rate of S$1 per 100 Max Miles.,btohqsg
"Correct. Not saying that this company is out to scam  but we should always be wary these days of ""new"" companies or payment methods.",btohqsg
have you done any background research on this company? somehow something just feels a bit off but I can't put a finger on it.,btohqsg
maybe it's due to one of my last bad experience with a company called Six which also had a referral scheme that started before official launch. I had so much referrals that I think I am the number one already. And guess what? after they collected all the personal data  they RESET the whole referral scheme  buy kept all the personal data collected.,btohqsg
sounds like a lot of effort and costs to pull this off. Will not be surprised if they charge any fee. But if they do then may not be worth it to use the Max Card.,btohqsg
also  many of us spend not based on which card give the most cashback  there are additional considerations eg. to make sure we meet the minimum sum for the month for any specific cards. for example if I'm clocking UOB to meet $2000 spend a month  I might use the card for purchase even if another card I own give higher cashback for a specific purchase.,btohqsg
We shall see once the product is launched. Need to do a bit of testing and review it myself,btohqsg
But for cash back card holders we need to clock min spend first so may not be that useful i guess,btohqsg
Yes. As they collected your card number as well. So it kind of worry.So probably have to take note about this. And many card have minimum amount to fulfilled not really sure how this card help too.,btohqsg
even if they do not charge you fee directly  the amount of data they collect from you is already worth a lot  if all your spending goes through them.,btohqsg
Do anyone happen to know the exclusion MCC for amaze 4% Cashback ? Thanks,btohqsg
Note also  need min $10 per transaction from Amaze wallet and 4x points max out at $125 spend per transaction,btohqsg
Can consider using Bolt in Thailand too,btohqsg
