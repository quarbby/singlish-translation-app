Hi all‚Ä¶ if I open a Moomoo account  will I be able to qualify for the transfer in rewards as well as take part in the moomoo cash plus program?,btohqsg
Benefits just does not justify the hefty fee,btohqsg
But happy to keep the physical metal card. Haha,btohqsg
Can use the card as mic holder. Like how Chris is using his amaze card.,btohqsg
Yes... it depends on each individual spending like what bro chris say. Can afford go for it... cannot never mind... for me is because I will go for the marriot programme. I will just pay the annual fee 1740 .. that's it... won't spend on welcome bonus 8k,btohqsg
What you mean bro. Mental card... .. you just say you cancel amex platinum charge card.?,btohqsg
You cancel the card they won‚Äôt take back the card lol,btohqsg
Your purpose is mainly for the Marriot programme to get hotel stay benefits?,btohqsg
Yes...Die die I won't cancel Amex. Because I need to use amex pay for hawker and coffee shop...ever since hsbc revolution nerd 5814 . And xnap apps down.. so better to keep Amex,btohqsg
What so great abt the Marriott programme with Amex. U plan to stay at Marriott chain hotels alot?,btohqsg

Name & picture shifter instead of shapeshifter üòÇ,btohqsg
Why don't get Amex with Hilton program. U might have a chance to run into Paris Hilton. üòÜ,btohqsg
Sometimes I feel like he's just testing us and he's some kind of lawyer or something,btohqsg
Because usually they have bonus offer for marriot bonvy .. and at discount. Most important is status match between Marriot Bonvoy with kris flyer,btohqsg
Yes.. will switch between marriot bonvy hotels and hilton honors,btohqsg
Well  you have to admit that he boosts discussions and keeps the entire group alive üòÇ,btohqsg
I am already at Marriott Gold liao. Wait for you to catch up ok? Âä†Ê≤πÔºÅüòú,btohqsg
The most important is to status match with Kris flyer status... bros if you are already a higher status at marriot bonvy or hilton honors loyalty programme.. do remember to status match with kris flyer.. in case you fall short the points of 50k qualifying Elite miles for Elite krisflyer gold.,btohqsg
Mine is this type of Gold. Based on you expertise  can qualify or not? üòÅ,btohqsg
Well done bro... you can status match Elite kris flyer,btohqsg
This one can earn the said elite miles that you always talk about?,btohqsg
Quick! I wait for you ah..,btohqsg
Can I check  its written spend $800 in the first 2 month   mean I need spend total of $1600 in the first 2 month or $800 between the first 2 month ?,btohqsg
