Premix into fuel tank and also into EO,btohqsg
Wow. Looks good. Was eyeing it before i decided on the fit. haha,btohqsg
Why didn't get it instead of the fit,btohqsg
First car  didnt wanna be too hiong sports car + manual. hahaha.,btohqsg
Introduction to the world of driving first,btohqsg
swift sport is alot of people's first car,btohqsg
Aiming the manual one. But cos 10 over years no drive manual  i scared. LOL,btohqsg
You dont own a manual car  you'll never have the practice to drive manual,btohqsg
Atleast not like me no manual licence,btohqsg
later stall too many times kena honk by drivers behind haha,btohqsg
The first manual car i own,btohqsg
But wa  i think i more or less decided on a manual car for my next car. lol,btohqsg
Till now i still stall my MX5 sometimes,btohqsg
Then i'll just raise my hand say waitt ah,btohqsg
I see my mscp there got one type r. Reverse into parking lot the exhaust also vroom vroom,btohqsg
Haisss u and your top down,btohqsg
dont know if the driver purposely or what,btohqsg
Reverse vroom already louder than my front vroom,btohqsg
but i did that last time cos my flywheel was lightened  the car damn easy stall,btohqsg
so I have to rev high,btohqsg
then end up became a habit,btohqsg
really steam. Every since then  i gien manual already hahahaha,btohqsg
With lightened flywheel last time i go up plaza sing  i rev till 3 or 4k then slowly clutch up,btohqsg
No wrong ah  fit is a good car,btohqsg
Cos its the only car i can afford,btohqsg
but if you eyeing the new swift sport  then i will question,btohqsg
cos the new swift sport is 1.4 turbo under 1 tonne,btohqsg
it's like a different league from fit,btohqsg
Cos CVT sibei dulan to drive,btohqsg
Ok lah. At least now drive the base model fit already  i roughly know what i want for my next car,btohqsg

End up is we just repackage salonpas,btohqsg
salonpas on the chinchin is gonna burn tho,btohqsg
I wanted manual and that was the only one in CAT A that is recent,btohqsg
But got some bad news also,btohqsg
The 1.4T hybrid is not exactly as modable as the normal 33s,btohqsg
Japan never sold the hybrid  it is for Europe only,btohqsg
Your parts support all have to be from Europe. Not Japan,btohqsg
suspension parts most of them  if not all  can be fitted.,btohqsg
engine most of them cannot. Including air intake.,btohqsg
Guys for heavy footers is golf a bad choice due to dsg,btohqsg
You need to find europe tuners to make aftermarket parts for the hybrid 33s,btohqsg
DSG is a bad choice doesn't matter what foot you have,btohqsg
ohh wow ok I didn't know this... haha I went to garage r and project s they both said have parts that can be installed,btohqsg
Chu Chu sound from the blow of valve,btohqsg
Eh. Holland V the open air cp and the mscp all gone already ?,btohqsg
The engine block itself is the same K14,btohqsg
ok the funny thing is garage R specialise in the non hybrid 33s,btohqsg
So likely is they won't know the other stuff until they played it,btohqsg
if i am not wrong the main block is the same,btohqsg
but your engine has integrated motor assist,btohqsg
just waiting for an exhaust to be legal then will probably change intercooler  downpipe and exhaust then go for a tune,btohqsg
Can look brands like remus and ask them to get it legalized for you,btohqsg
"My exhaust is the one and only in sg too from remus. Cos my car also not ""JDM""",btohqsg
Can just stick to PJS and ask them what mods they have. and go from there,btohqsg
but also becareful of raymond's pushy sales tactic,btohqsg
He will sell you things you dont need and make you buy them,btohqsg
Hi@KLZH1999may I ask ur swift is which year one ar,btohqsg
Nice üëç but I hardly see them on the road idk why but I like üëç,btohqsg
hahaha hopefully I won't overspent my budget,btohqsg
I think cause 140k can get a lot of other better cars,btohqsg
Wont be cheap la for 33s. hahaha,btohqsg
before all the coe go crazy,btohqsg
when I got it was about 130k,btohqsg
I quickly go down to buy,btohqsg
BRZ was 140k when coe was low,btohqsg
I hope this is not the new normal sia,btohqsg
U know like Vios is like 10K dep,btohqsg
i was initially thinking on waiting to get either gr corolla or 400z but seeing as the coes is constantly going up,btohqsg
I decide to get a cheaper one for now,btohqsg
But u bought 2020 I think u earn,btohqsg
Probably u sell end of next year confirm earn,btohqsg
@DesVvvwe waiting for ur lunch jio leh,btohqsg
Just saying ar not asking u to sell haha,btohqsg
hard to buy anything decent also,btohqsg
I want to get golf sia,btohqsg
Then 15K dep then I like f@@@@,btohqsg
Everybody wants to buy a gold,btohqsg
I really like the Chu Chu,btohqsg
My friend golf buy less then 2 months,btohqsg
or the piston shoot out of the top block,btohqsg
He havent do water pump ah,btohqsg
Maybe I should just get accord first haha,btohqsg
His ABS sensor also havent do ah,btohqsg
I ask him don‚Äôt buy lol,btohqsg
Cause previous owner tuned up to 340 HP,btohqsg
Then in the end it‚Äôs not that cheap,btohqsg
then you still wanna buy hahaha,btohqsg
No la I buy ppl repair de la bro,btohqsg
I buy car 1 -2 years then I sell alr,btohqsg
Maybe should stick to Honda Civic,btohqsg
normally VW parts 1-2 years fail,btohqsg
Ayyy project s Raymond my previous workshop,btohqsg
I got consider scirocco also. That time i saw a few but all 4-6 owners...,btohqsg
every 1-2 years prepare pay 20 to 30k to fix,btohqsg
then MU every 4 to 5 years,btohqsg
Walao civic fc dep same as Mercedes‚Äô sia,btohqsg
My friend used to work at synchrowerkz,btohqsg
This is really a crazy crazy market,btohqsg
Their regular is every 2 or 3 months come in fix something one,btohqsg
Wah then it‚Äôs the car workshop best friend,btohqsg
They fix VW cars till the mechanics can bets alr,btohqsg
they will bet with the driver  eh your this one when will fail,btohqsg
then they bet among themselves  today this car come in what spoil,btohqsg
Cos it's routinely the same shit that will spoil,btohqsg
Mine hatchback. More ex than mercs liao ü•π,btohqsg
So bad ah golf and scirocco,btohqsg
is the brand got issue or owners lup ?,btohqsg
But stock ones also go there,btohqsg
vomit blood sia if every alternate month go ws fix things,btohqsg
their seals fail within 1 to 2 years,btohqsg
sensors then 1 by 1 fail,btohqsg
VW cannot buy those with many owners,btohqsg
How about the dry and wet clutch ? My friends warned me never to go for the dry clutch de,btohqsg
My Jetta lasted 9.5 years no issue,btohqsg
Now golf only one previous owner also no issue,btohqsg
Nothing spoil yet or nothing major spoil yet,btohqsg
Means each time a VW drive pass me  i need to bow down show respect,btohqsg
If driver loot.. then no need to say,btohqsg
So also depends on driver or previous owner,btohqsg
your DSG clutch havent change meh,btohqsg
Like that you really quite heng,btohqsg
or you service your car regularly,btohqsg
I have friends that buy new jetta within 3 years also sold,btohqsg
I traded in my Jetta.. it‚Äôs never seen again.. lol,btohqsg
But for young‚Äôs guys that one turbo,btohqsg
VW get only one previous owner and low mileage should be quite safe I think,btohqsg
But hard to find in market,btohqsg
Workshop told me it's a terrible car,btohqsg
Maybe he one of the lucky few,btohqsg
I heard MK7.5 not that bad,btohqsg
BMW not as bad as VW la,btohqsg
Ok if u get bmw don‚Äôt get n13 maybe,btohqsg
But dsg will always shift faster then us la,btohqsg
Anyone owns accord or euro r,btohqsg
Fd2 engine isn't a type r engine even though it's a k20,btohqsg
So naturally it's more for fc compared to the fd2r or cl7r,btohqsg
Plus the euro r is heavy,btohqsg
Full tank can go my record *** 250 km,btohqsg
Euro r generally I get 7 to 8km/ltr,btohqsg
I drive na until a bit sian but I scared my wallet cannot handle,btohqsg
Wondering if the white Euro R owner i saw almost every morning is here or not.,btohqsg
From Toa Payoh go up the round about then go to PIE,btohqsg
U stay Bishan or Yishun right I remember seeing ur car,btohqsg
Every morning around 6.40am like that will have a white euro R. Quite loud one haha,btohqsg
here got any Yishun kakis ?,btohqsg
I mostly either Yishun or Tampines,btohqsg
Ur car how loud no one care,btohqsg
For sure not me... My car silent,btohqsg
Haha sure anot. Euro r no matter how silent also loud haha,btohqsg
5 hard la  unless long jam,btohqsg
U can get 3 kmpl if you keep the redline at 200 kmh,btohqsg
Used to be fucking loud until I changed to hks,btohqsg
Which i have never done before,btohqsg
So no shop in sg couldn't fix it up,btohqsg
So I fuck it and ordered the hks,btohqsg
Sold it to another euro r who wanted to give it a shot,btohqsg
K20.. 290k's on the odo still going strong,btohqsg
@chloetherx8if u go JB u not scared meh,btohqsg
Like what if no oil on the highway,btohqsg
Whether jb is scary or not‚Ä¶ is not how good looking your car is‚Ä¶ is what car parts are in demand‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Bro I drive Civic I damn scared,btohqsg
Got car wash in mall I wash,btohqsg
I carry 1 L engine oil and 1 L premix with me at all times‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Drive rx8‚Ä¶. U need to know your car intimately‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I take out my steering wheel if it's some ulu place,btohqsg
My eo is now 500ml below max. My spark plugs are at 25k km  my coils at 26k km. My coolant is 80%. My battery is 2 months old.,btohqsg
Im not at my car btw,btohqsg
I know AmZ in Malaysia not bad,btohqsg
They take out and spray? Or spray on it ?,btohqsg
Mazada RX8 wear and tear not that bad right,btohqsg
His is not a normal mazda,btohqsg
Spray on like that not uneven meh,btohqsg
Eating kway chup at woon kiang still make kissy face at chloe üòò,btohqsg
I thinking of changing to turbo car,btohqsg
Line of sight is best  otherwise use this,btohqsg
But it takes a special kind of owner to own a rx8,btohqsg
If your the don't maintain car kind  best to walk away,btohqsg
If take care  its cheaper than roc or golf anytime,btohqsg
If never take care  once the slide starts its very hard to stop,btohqsg
A fail leads to B fail leads to C damage leads to D fail leads to,btohqsg
But I must fall in love with the car then I buy it,btohqsg
There's a fn2r available... Just went to view it on Sunday with@akimiJW,btohqsg
She also same boat as you,btohqsg
Dont want to maintain car  actually a lot of performance car are out,btohqsg
But I trying to sell my car at a break even price,btohqsg
There is no such thing as a car that can whack but like altis maintenance,btohqsg
I don't remember it was you also asking about the euro r right?,btohqsg
Euro r only comes in manual,btohqsg
So I am converting once I start to work,btohqsg
Yup the question is who can actually take the mental load and financial load,btohqsg
But accord k20 vs civic K20 what‚Äôs the diff,btohqsg
Another 15k i need to order new plugs already.,btohqsg
And one more reason why I want to move away from NA,btohqsg
The cl7a one I'm really not sure... But the Cl7r is basically a dc5r or fd2r engine,btohqsg
Last week I round 1 week,btohqsg
Lets get one thing straight ya turbo doesnt cut your FC  its smaller displacement and lighter foot,btohqsg
since u converting just get economy car for now lo,btohqsg
U buy a 2L turbo thinking ur fc better,btohqsg
They say golf can hit 20 km\L,btohqsg
U really want fc  drive a cvt or hybrid,btohqsg
You want fc  you need like a Honda fit,btohqsg
U want can play can launch one‚Ä¶ dont be shy to pump liao,btohqsg
Fd2 not sure what to change to actually,btohqsg
Like what would be an upgrade,btohqsg
If u want to bluff yourself to save money on petrol  buy a tesla‚Ä¶ and wait for battery change or road tax,btohqsg
Is like u save petrol then u waste few k on dsg,btohqsg
From fd2 to euro s  the interior won't be too surprised,btohqsg
dont worry here got plenty of VAG brothers,btohqsg
U want sttututututu or u want brap brap or u want vtec,btohqsg
Have... Fd2 one piang. Become 2.2,btohqsg
2.4 is known to be less reliable than 2.2,btohqsg
I think u will enjoy 1 or 2 jz,btohqsg
Hardly piang. Got turbo. Got power,btohqsg
There 2jz also which u can googles,btohqsg
wa v long never hear about mark x,btohqsg
I go eat lunch first haha,btohqsg
rarely see it on the streets,btohqsg
I think I shall just order lunch,btohqsg
But order is cheap if more then 1,btohqsg
Always need to hit minimum $13 onwards,btohqsg
