Holy grail don‚Äôt have the notes man‚Ä¶ tried searching for the codes,btohqsg
YAYY I rlly cannot mathI feel nauseous it‚Äôs so monotonous to me SORRY IF I OFFENDED ANYONE‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt concentrate,btohqsg
Do yall have any CE notes I can see,btohqsg
But yea all have math uh,btohqsg
Yeah bad news because all kinds of engineering needs math,btohqsg
I think math is fineBut hardcore like dsai or cs I rlly cannot,btohqsg
Do yall have any lobang or insights?,btohqsg
idk what‚Äôs going on but fuck math,btohqsg
I js don‚Äôt see myself in it,btohqsg
But if it‚Äôs what I gotta do Idm lo,btohqsg
Apparently I see the syllabus it‚Äôs so diff from my poly friends,btohqsg
I rlly cannot find content notes to refer from sia :(,btohqsg
Ok but CS and CE ones are diff from DSAI,btohqsg
The cs and ce ones are their own one,btohqsg
Dsai stats is the same as math major stats,btohqsg
Based on the curriculum names I see,btohqsg
Have witnessed the dsai stats one before and...let me tell you the bell curve is .... shit.,btohqsg
But yea  ce deals with like electrical circuits,btohqsg
So i guess if you like hardware stuff  you can join ce,btohqsg
Hell no  that is why i do physics :D,btohqsg
Any websites for me to start learning python?,btohqsg
Well tbh i cant rlly recommend a coding website,btohqsg
But i highly recommend learning python and c++ or R,btohqsg
The problem is idk if ce does c++ or R,btohqsg
Tbh idk what prog languages they do,btohqsg
Youtube has like learning videos about all you need to know about python,btohqsg
i used this website to learn more about css / html but there's python beta offered on freecodecamp nowhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/,btohqsg
it's a self-learning and certification will be issued once you've completed all interactive coding stages,btohqsg
dk if completing thlse free basic freecodecamp scientific commiting language course would consider an actual form of coding certification,btohqsg
just a fun thing to consider or try out,btohqsg
you def need to look into it more bc like,btohqsg
stats in uni are also diff from jc stats,btohqsg
damn a lfa..hope this one dont end up in norway like the white one,btohqsg
Hello! For this one  why don‚Äôt want to just say:print (‚Äúhello  ???‚Äù)print(name),btohqsg
For sep  is it only applicable for 2 variables? What if there are 3?,btohqsg
so if you have some variables - eg print(‚Äúx‚Äù  ‚Äúy‚Äù  end ‚Äú ‚Äú) then it seperates the variable by whatever is in the end ‚Äú ‚Äú,btohqsg
or it‚Äôs a different type of end cause honestly idk üíÄ,btohqsg
the default ending for print is \n so the two print statements would be on different lines,btohqsg
you could just put it all into one print but it has uses when managing how we want the line to look,btohqsg
sep is really just what goes between the diff elements so it doesn‚Äôt matter how many you have,btohqsg
when it comes to python  most questions can be answered by googling the param/function and reading the doc a bit,btohqsg
end is like printing it all on one line right?,btohqsg
yea unless you specify end to be ‚Äú\n‚Äù still,btohqsg
Hi everyone I‚Äôm curious to hear from anyone who has gone through the WPLN (Workplace Literacy and Numeracy) assessment. How was your experience? Did you manage to continue your studies after completing the assessment? Diploma? Nitec? What are the possible pathways?I'm wondering what the path forward looks like after taking the test  and whether it helped open up opportunities for further education or career development.PS: im actually a secondary school dropout in my late twenties with only a psle cert and i have been working ever since i dropped out  im now looking for more opportunities!Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in advance,btohqsg
While I have the cert  I did not really use it to apply for anything. I am not sure if it does have any use in the workplace.,btohqsg
im thinking if i can use it to further my studies..,btohqsg
u can try and to ask higher educational institutions' customer service or just contact them by email / phone call  to ask about this kind of scenarios  despite being a secondary school dropout with only a psle certification to your name-- you can either let them know this is what you're personally experiencing OR indirectly ask about this hypothetical scenario  what should you do if you're still interested in further studies despite the limitations of how far you can take your studies further,btohqsg
i heard that from my mom who went to take the WPLN at least 2-3 times because she couldn't pass one of the exams  for those with that assessment certification-- you can NORMALLY only apply for short-term ite courses or those technical course  dunno if it's considered under nitec or technical diploma  short term courses offered under various programmes in vocational college (both ite and poly),btohqsg
not too sure on the specifics though,btohqsg
best of luck  and might want to start your journey to further studying sooner than later because usually vocational colleges of higher learning education paths will have a soft cap* for their student intakesoft cap* - refers to how usually they will try to accept those below a certain age but will try to proceed to make a decision after scaling through every profile that would end up being rejected if not appealed for a case-by-case reconsideration allowed those struggling yet really interested students who also happen to be older than the usual ages for poly / ite that aren't opting for nursing  to enrol with special situations or circumstances that they might consider giving you a chance for,btohqsg
