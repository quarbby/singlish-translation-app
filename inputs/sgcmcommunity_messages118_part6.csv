it's similar to a dealer sourced loan?,btohqsg
you choose how much you want to down,btohqsg
bank will give you a loan based on your income etc of a maximum of 70%,btohqsg
then you choose how much you want to avail,btohqsg
so if bank loan max amount for me is 100k  but the car i buy i only need loan 50k,btohqsg
so bank will just issue 50k?,btohqsg
erm that's not how it works,btohqsg
But hearsay rich people full loan their car,btohqsg
when you apply for a loan,btohqsg
yah i know one person that does it..,btohqsg
you will give them the price you're buying at,btohqsg
and how much you will put down,btohqsg
they won't anyhow issue loan one,btohqsg
cause the tenure and interest rate based on car age is different,btohqsg
tiagong is the person who said this,btohqsg
Also this is how shady dealers get you full loan too,btohqsg
but if there's no demand  there's no supply,btohqsg
yeah by inflating the price so that it looks like you paid the downpayment,btohqsg
there's enough and more uneducated buyers out in the market who don't understand the risk of full loans,btohqsg
and they see a way to start driving a car without forking out a hefty sum one shot,btohqsg
i always like to say this statement,btohqsg
instead just pay monthly as if they're using atome to buy the car,btohqsg
are there many people who full loan cars? risky business,btohqsg
they can always afford a car  what they can't afford is on the maintenance,btohqsg
yeah bro.. more than u expect,btohqsg
It genuinely surprises on how much people are willing to full loan,btohqsg
i see many luxury cars with very young drivers,btohqsg
oh some prolly insurance agents or property agents,btohqsg
that's what they realize after going into it,btohqsg
and they realize the monthly hard to maintain,btohqsg
and then they go to sell,btohqsg
but cannot meet full settlement price,btohqsg
because their deal was a shitty one,btohqsg
My civic is on the market right now,btohqsg
they say always live within your means.. but the trend is changing to live BELOW your means liao,btohqsg
monthly installment too high that even after selling they have to pay interest?,btohqsg
Literally everyone asked for full loan,btohqsg
u consign or direct owner ah,btohqsg
until now haven sell ah? faster sell lah,btohqsg
no more like the total amount they owe  they are unable to sell the car for that amount,btohqsg
if direct owner  how can you help them with full loan?,btohqsg
I loan him with my money,btohqsg
u sell  abit below market lo,btohqsg
if u want a quick sale,btohqsg
All want full loan but not everyone wanna pay 1.2k for a civic,btohqsg
No lah  not urgent to sell,btohqsg
I just put in the market  if sell then sell,btohqsg
u just dw drive cus maintenance hiong nia,btohqsg
im not saying u cannot afford ah dont get me wrong,btohqsg
yes but a man can be bored of other cars,btohqsg
