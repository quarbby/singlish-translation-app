Any seniors can share their view on the TP of VP??? My holdings are green but wanted to have a sensing how much greener I can grow before letting loose,btohqsg
avarga chart similar to isdn leh,btohqsg

To be honest isdn bb slight better than avarga one😂,btohqsg
Lol all the talk after the stock move up,btohqsg
at least isdn got report to help breakout 😂,btohqsg
Just not too long ago people cursing and swearing at isdn,btohqsg
If my memory bo fail me,btohqsg
Ya sia  buy up and sell down. Hahah,btohqsg
coz bulk of the people here trade short to med term...  it took almost 6 months (Aug 2020 to Jan 2021) for ISDN to break convincingly 0.45 barrier.. how many of us can wait that long,btohqsg
Hopefully MT will also release some good news/updates....,btohqsg
They entice you go buy then trap you in,btohqsg
Furion u are the catalyst 😆,btohqsg
avarga daily.a clear break abovev the triangle but nope it ain't gonna run (like isdn for now). the previous 29 cent resistance look more like a support for now. perhaps a fast and furious run above 30 cent will ensue soon.or perhaps analyst to cover it soon?plenty of catalyst to trigger a run (similar to how it is portrayed in ISDN cimb report)catalyst catalyst catalyst.....,btohqsg
Joined back the Moya Party $0.073,btohqsg
Heard many shout Moya Moya. So I'll do Moya for Moya holders. I personally don't like to play this counter unless it can close above 80. Broke out of downtrend trendline. And finally broke 72 stubborn resistance. MACD histogram still moving up. More upside in the coming days. One thing to take note.... This BBs also lasup BBs. Will see whether this BBs can suddenly become nice BBs like GKE....,btohqsg
