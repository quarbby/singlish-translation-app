78.75rp is the 10th percentile. Can't really tell but I think it's a good enough indication,btohqsg

I think cambridge think i bodoh?,btohqsg

I think AB also better than A.,btohqsg
do yall know any quick remedies for food poisoning,btohqsg
such that i can at least fall asleep,btohqsg
Erm normally if my fd poisoning is so bad that i couldnt sleep  i jus go 24hr clinic,btohqsg
Another remedy is sleep with the pain after a few times in the toilet,btohqsg
Idk  nvr tried but i dont suggest la cos i took wrong medication and ended upvomiting foam,btohqsg
Idk lol my mom jus gave it to me out of panic but i was sick so didn't and couldn't think too much abt it xD,btohqsg
Usually that med works but i guess that time is a more severe fd poisoning or smthü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...but like you said might be allergy,btohqsg
do u rmb what u took,btohqsg
Yea a tiny yellow polka dot med  from prev  doc visits  for fd poisoning ba,btohqsg
Dun rmb the pill name alr but had to gokk then they gave me some purple fluid(glucose) to ingest then wait for awhile to see if i still vomit..and if i did vomit  which i kinda felt like but didnt after ingesting glucose 2nd time  i had to be hospitalised,btohqsg
Yee but it was years ago. Not that recent anymore haha,btohqsg
What happens to my points if I am from higher Chinese in secondary school means I don't take jc chinese,btohqsg
HCL D7 then don‚Äôt need alr,btohqsg
h1 Chinese is basically just HCL,btohqsg

looks nicer than AUU / U,btohqsg
Then no bonus points lor. Anyway if you get 90rp if your mtl is A it would be useless since you can‚Äôt possibly increase your rp any further,btohqsg

Hi guys! With the whole Russia-Ukraine situation  please take note that when speaking to your Russian and Ukrainian friends that WE ARE NOT OUR GOVERNMENT. You're not speaking to Putin or Zelensky  you're speaking to A PERSON YOU KNOW. A lot of Russians have family members in Ukraine  and a lot of Ukrainians have family members in Russia. Nobody wants war  especially not civilians. WE ARE HUMANS.,btohqsg
Real case. Boy in sg died from diarrhea. Think it was 1-2 yrs ago,btohqsg
They're basically telling u  be kind to Russians/Ukrainians because they don't want it any more than we do.,btohqsg
ig the rising tensions kinda   lead to xenophobia against russians/ukrainians,btohqsg
Kinda like how covid made Asians a target for hatecrimes and stuff,btohqsg

Are you interested in pursuing Medicine?This post is for everyone interested in studying Medicine in the future  but mainly aimed at those in JC2/Poly. I created a Discord server back in2018/2019for JC/Poly students interested in applying to Medicine. I advertise the server every year during the admissions period and we have had 4 batches of applicants. Here are the posts from 2021 and 2020.The purpose of this server is to bring together Medicine applicants to tide through the application process together. Applicants will also be able to clarify any queries with the seniors in the group who are currently pursuing medicine (they were the applicants who joined the server in the previous years  we have a few doctors as well!)Everyone is welcome to join! Even if you aren't applying this year  I suggest you join and take a look if you're interested :-)Link:https://discord.gg/bCmUdjkInstructions: When you join the discord server  please read the instructions and get a role or you won‚Äôt have access to the other channels.,btohqsg

e.g. I got in an interior design firm a while ago  without having a degree (am thinking of continuing with my job for at least one-two years) then going to NAFA/ laselle next year Aug,btohqsg
What if mine was six years IP programme,btohqsg
Oh sorry what I meant was,btohqsg
Will there be like special case for people who never meet Nafa/ Laselle minimum requirements? Maybe additional interview & assessment?,btohqsg
Can call n ask ah haha,btohqsg
But I think got special case based on this,btohqsg
They probably ask u go take gp or smth IELTS,btohqsg
As a conditional test or smth,btohqsg
hello guys does anyone know where i can print like a few hundred+ pages and bind for cheap,btohqsg

Kidnap the chers help u print,btohqsg
Buy laser printer (black and white),btohqsg
I only know if print in bulk then yea,btohqsg
No offense to anyone but question,btohqsg
Is it true that recruiters are usually hated in the professional world,btohqsg
Like me and my friends applying for jobs,btohqsg
Always rant about how when they're rejected the recruiter ghosts instead of just saying you're rejected',btohqsg
And on the jobs subreddit too,btohqsg
Pretty clear that recruiters aren't popular,btohqsg
they dont have the responsibility to tell u that,btohqsg
It's something which I heard that they're hated for,btohqsg
Like on the subreddits about finding jobs too,btohqsg
A ton of people seem to hate on them for this,btohqsg
ok i mean we hate those that spam our telegram trying to earn money,btohqsg
But other than that its ok bah,btohqsg
(If any of them r seeing this  hi),btohqsg
Some jobs do state that you'll be contacted only if youre shortlisted,btohqsg
Ye I'm referring to the ones,btohqsg
That lie throigh their teeth and say we'll get back to you then ghost,btohqsg
instead of just saying 'you're rejected',btohqsg
tbf sometimes they gotta think abt it,btohqsg
also admins can i promote a project here üëâüèªüëàüèª,btohqsg
Nobody thinks about it for that long,btohqsg
or maybe the clients slow to reply,btohqsg
My sch bookshop charges like 5 cents per piece of paper,btohqsg
And binder $1 I think but I don‚Äôt think they got a thick binder,btohqsg
but are they willing to print 600+ pages,btohqsg
Plus I doubt you can just walk inside the bookshop,btohqsg
I think should be able to bah like whenever each class requests for lecture notes they easily print over 100 pages per set for each class,btohqsg
Wow what school? Thats quite cheap.,btohqsg
quite a few pages for quite cheap,btohqsg
but 600+ will prob burn the printer lol,btohqsg
i burn printers in my free time,btohqsg
N/O/A level timetable come out liao,btohqsg
that's why I use office printers.Probably at least 5000+ prints per month,btohqsg
typical print cost is 1 cents per side.Paper is about 1 cent each pageBut rental cost and manpower cost is what they are charging u. Photocopier rental is around 250 / mth.So they need to charge you at least 5 cents to break even,btohqsg
Yeah and probably can charge cheap only because of sch rent being very Low,btohqsg
I think they probably only pay less than $100 a month in rent,btohqsg
school is different. Their cost is even lower because they are probably their own supplier and maintenance.For me the costs are all in.,btohqsg
Direct hiring managers do the same as well leh,btohqsg
Also nowadays it's more common for companies to use agencies for manpower sourcing,btohqsg
And generally agencies will try to help you get the job to the best of their abilities,btohqsg
Of course the one accepting or rejecting your app is always the company  agencies only help you put a good word in,btohqsg
I got big MNC HR say will forward my resume to hiring team and end up ghosting me despite sending follow up email coz I didn't hear anything from hiring team,btohqsg
"I tot it shld be obvious enof if  not contacted esp if they state ""we will contact u when ur shortlisted..."" after a period of time? Once that time period passes  can call to double confirm aso if paranoid xD",btohqsg
Ya can always send follow up email,btohqsg
If some agency nvr state that line then must call? No choice wot,btohqsg
Gov workday is world leader on ghosting you  forever application under review,btohqsg
Oke time for me to find job also,btohqsg
I guess it time to cry with you?,btohqsg

"recruiters will always ""ghost""..1. u muz realize u are only applying for one job. but they will have at least ten applications for that one job  if not hundreds. to add on  they likely have to fill other job positions too. so while you are thinking ""why cant u call me?""  if the recruiter do that  he will need to call hundreds of ppl that dont help him complete his job.2. often  the direct hirer is just kiv-ing applicants  so the recruiters have no idea what is happening too.if anyone is looking for pt jobs  can pm me for a chat. helping an insurer look for sales interns  4k a mth.",btohqsg
