My personal preference would also be cash for the purpose of tax deduction,btohqsg
But it's only 1 time up to 8k cash contribution right?,btohqsg
Every year until your SA hit FRS. So if you do an OA to SA transfer  basically you will hit your FRS faster.,btohqsg
I thought so too. So will just spend on one card then. Thank you JJ,btohqsg
The one that give most rebate for your spending. In consideration are maybank family and friends  citi cashback  uob one  cimb visa signature  uob evol  dbs livefresh  ocbc frank....,btohqsg
it seems cant top up grabpay with bigpay anymore,btohqsg
Anyone has an idea how to see your actual balance in EZlink pay by wallet card (using it to pay for public transport),btohqsg
Nahh the balances never make sense one and can't see anything in TL simplygo too (as a result becomes frustrating when my card actually got declined when boarding the bus),btohqsg
this is because they deduct the max amount before calculating the final amount. similar to EZpay... every 2 weeks -$50 in my CC...,btohqsg
simplygo dun show card balance ah,btohqsg
Oh thought he want to see usage,btohqsg
Ya odd it won't show card balance,btohqsg
Mayhe is it not fully sync wirh the new updates,btohqsg
Hahaha simplygo doesn't show balance or trips for this card at all ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg

how to apply under singsaver for cimb infinite card if the route is going via fd deposit ?,btohqsg
If you want to get the Singsaver gifts  suggest to sign up for the entry cards first. then after that work with CIMB directly for fixed deposit and VI,btohqsg
True lah.. but shouldn't take this long to post a few transactions (over two weeks) and then at least make an effort toreflect balances that are put on hold instead of just stating an amount as pending  but when u add up it doesn't even tally#justrantingalittleAnyway i decided to move to Revolut given I don't have any cards that reward for public transport  but at least i have the transparency of how much I spent per trip.  Cheers!,btohqsg
