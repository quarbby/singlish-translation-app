shld i just stick with it and get the A since no one genuinely likes their subj combi anyways,btohqsg
If u think u would do better with chem phys or math than switch lol if not just stick with it,btohqsg
And ya like almost no one enjoys every subject they tend to love like at most one or 2 and hate the rest,btohqsg
so in my case if i only hate lit,btohqsg
i might hate geog sooner or later but oh wells,btohqsg
Perhaps if by the end of the year itâ€™s still the same,btohqsg
i feel like im just convincing myself to tough it out lol but ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
maybe if i see again iâ€™ll fry,btohqsg
I mean if itâ€™s only lit you hate maybe just switch it out for something else,btohqsg

Why do you wanna take lit if you're not passionate about it,btohqsg

It's possible to have passion and still not do well,btohqsg
but if i chnge lit i needa chnge pw + class :/,btohqsg
idk if its worth this sacrifice,btohqsg
ig try to talk to ur subj head... see if anyth can be arranged,btohqsg
could i just ask  why did you choose the subject,btohqsg
I think if its for math etc it's worth it,btohqsg
Bc math is needed for alot of stuff in uni apps,btohqsg
I rly feel lit is a subj that needs alot of intrinsic passion bc there's rly not much extrinsic payoff in it,btohqsg
bc the most common arts subj combi is GELm,btohqsg
yeaaaa my class populated w HELm ://,btohqsg
yall know where to get documents printed for at a cheaper rate,btohqsg

yo  can anyone explain if pentane has a higher density than its isomer 2 2-dimethylpropane,btohqsg
Straight chain alkane molecules are more closely packed than molecules of their branched isomers  hence the former is denser,btohqsg

you can't just follow the trend when choosing combi...,btohqsg

Dont pick the inferior BCME cannot even go BIO Med eng with it,btohqsg
NUS reject me from bio med Eng coz no PHY bg in either o or a lvl,btohqsg
NTU offered bio eng to me via ABA,btohqsg
BCME only if u really aim medicine or dentistryor you just love memorisation of information.Or so I think,btohqsg
is it worth it to take phy tuition for o levels even tho i wonâ€™t be taking it in jc,btohqsg
Well do u need ur phy grade to go JC?,btohqsg
