Hello does anyone know how the application for PSC scholarship work? And what they generally look out for?,btohqsg

"He still can ""haha"" the top comment",btohqsg
He go poly take sci course equally die,btohqsg
He thinks poly sci is easier than H2 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good fking luck.,btohqsg
I was from comb sci without amath as well  definitely didn't die learning h2 chem.,btohqsg
probs just the stigma surrounding poly,btohqsg
Good I want to see him jump and die,btohqsg
Maybe the learning style not for him. Its good that he switch early rather than too late,btohqsg
it was in my face eh,btohqsg
im p sure i rolled my eyes at a couple atp,btohqsg
i cannot it was so EXCESSIVE HELLO,btohqsg
how come more ppl wanna go poly nowadays,btohqsg
i also know a shit ton of poly kids who dont intend to pursue degree,btohqsg
like ig more people are seeing poly as a legitimate path,btohqsg
but for the most part  uni is still q essential in sg for long term,btohqsg
how so in career prospects bruv,btohqsg
the appeal of being able to do smth they enjoy at a pre uni level can't be understated,btohqsg
and being able to work in that field right after,btohqsg
the issue is i find a lot of those people thinking they can make up for the lack of degree with purely experience,btohqsg
which is only half true and depends on what area they go into,btohqsg
alot of the poly kids ik call degree a ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù,btohqsg
got someone tell me that he doesnt like studying for a ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù he even dropped out of poly,btohqsg
yea  but a piece of paper that by itself gets you through some employer's initial screenings,btohqsg
esp if go govt job hor,btohqsg
nowadays ppl dont see the importance of education,btohqsg
like there's a reason why a lot of older people go back for their degree eventually,btohqsg
i think the enticing part is being able to work and earn money earlier  build experience,btohqsg
but they don't see the eventual cap on positions they can take,btohqsg
just cos of the lack of a degree,btohqsg
(disclaimer: not all industries but yes),btohqsg
I think depends more on the class & cse,btohqsg
