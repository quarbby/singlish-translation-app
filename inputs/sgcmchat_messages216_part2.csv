"SEATs are fun little thingsAlways love how they do stuffVW: ""My Spanish child  here is my Golf GTI MK7. All you have to do is change the body and badge to make your new Leon Cupra""SEAT: ""AYE CARAMBA!! We +50hp to the engine and we remove half the airbags because in Spain  when we crash we die like real men!!""",btohqsg
used to ride this car last year during f1,btohqsg
I laughed so much at the last part ðŸ¤£ but itâ€™s facts,btohqsg
i think a lot of ppl get to ride it last year,btohqsg
Usually the Leon Cupra is higher-HP but less features and luxuries than the Golf GTI of that same gen,btohqsg
Among which I recall  passengers and side curtain airbags is standard on the GTI but optional extra on the Cupra,btohqsg
But here they just go crazy with diesel engines,btohqsg
Leon cupra in kinda same as golf gti CS,btohqsg
In a way  the Leon Cupra is a less expensive and less luxurious Golf GTI CS,btohqsg
anyone know where the BMW M3 GTRâ€™s are in the world & how many were made?,btohqsg
In order to homologate the M3 GTR for racing  a road version was developed during calendar year 2001 and shown for the first time at the season ending ALMS Petit Le Mans race. BMW produced 10 development units of which 3 were production ready display cars. For homologation purposes  the M3 GTR needed to be offered for sale to the general public and by Petit Le Mans 2001  the car was ready. The M3 GTR was to be priced atâ‚¬250 000 [86]When ALMS changed the homologation rules at the end of the 2001 season  the road version project was stopped. All 7 development prototypes were recycled but the three production ready display cars exist to this day and all still owned by BMW AG. One of the Road M3 GTRs was displayed by BMW of North America LLC atLegends of the Autobahnin 2015 along with the newly restored ALMS race version of the car.[87]The road cars were built alongside bodies-in-white of the GTR race cars in the special vehicles department of BMW's Regensburg Plant.,btohqsg
Basically they followed the rulebook that said that they needed to sell 10 road legal M3 GTR to homologate the M3 GTR race car,btohqsg
When the rules were changed to become 100 (because Porsche complained TEACHER  BMW IS CHEATING) BMW decided to scrap the road car program (7 recycled  the remaining 3 are still with BMW) and discontinue the M3 GTR racing program,btohqsg

guys is there an lambo essenza in Singapore,btohqsg
as long as u believe in ur heart,btohqsg
ts probably like fake news or smth,btohqsg
it got spotted here a few months ago,btohqsg
Production of the Essenza SCV12 is limited to 40 units. The car is not legal for road use and is planned to have its own one-make racing series. The cars will be stored in a special hangar built near the Sant'Agata factory with the owners having the ability to monitor their cars via an app linked to security cameras. Lamborghini would let the customer take delivery of their car upon request  akin to Maserati who allowed customers to take delivery of theMC12 Versione Corse. Lamborghini is responsible for the maintenance and transportation of the cars to any one of the FIA class 1 tracks around the world  in the case that the owner does not wish to keep the car. Customers can also receive coaching from Lamborghini racing driversEmanuele PirroandMarco Mapelli.,btohqsg
it's so hard to believe but believable at the same time,btohqsg
well a little research online wld help back it up too,btohqsg
It probably hides in a bonded warehouse when not at a track,btohqsg
No way you will park this guy in your private garage due to the specialist storage and care required,btohqsg
And of course you don't want to pay the fucking GST and duty on this thing,btohqsg
how much maintenance even for these lor nvr start up(battery drain like siao ðŸ˜‚),btohqsg
and yes the obligatory cat photo,btohqsg
You will be surprised how much care goes into these bonded warehouse with climate control  someone goes to start them up every now and them based on a schedule  someone else arranges for them to go servicing as per manufacturer SOP etc,btohqsg
A friend of mine  this is literally his job,btohqsg
ill go check one of them out soon..,btohqsg
