then you see the slides of how many people get 90 and wonder if you are one of them,btohqsg
my batch ye  not sure about others but likely have,btohqsg
it was toxic because they show the 90 names first before they give out the certs LOL,btohqsg
then all the 90 hopefuls find out on the spot that they didn't get it,btohqsg
you can ask your grand senior who is also the 100rp legend,btohqsg
Ayo I smell fellow junior ?,btohqsg
With pride and joy let us sing~,btohqsg
Yes it's disgusting but do uk alumni who went to tjc rewear their skirts,btohqsg
Need a full stomach for ur appetiser of a 90rp later!!,btohqsg

ok i was overthinking yet again  i think it was a wa glitch yesterday,btohqsg
Im js gg around proclaiming on the rooftops,btohqsg
And i sometimes see diploma grads earning ard the same as uni grads,btohqsg

Plus they do it all the time,btohqsg
U put in everything u can,btohqsg
And u are willing yo alr,btohqsg
im not sure if prof will think it is last resort,btohqsg
coz im not cloose to anyone,btohqsg
It’s not like they can reprint on the spot,btohqsg
Yeah nth will change no matter how u worry,btohqsg
Even so they still do it all the time,btohqsg
it actually doesn’t matter like at all,btohqsg
profs do not care about this,btohqsg
does prof care if i ask during the application window,btohqsg
like at most profs will tell you they can’t be a good one and reject or they still try to help with disclaimer that there may not be much to say,btohqsg
like is it considered late for htem,btohqsg
for your thing do they have to write like a letter or?,btohqsg
it is just in the application form,btohqsg
ok then it’s not a big deal. like if they had to write a letter you’d wanna ask at least a month in advance but just listing their name it’s just getting a yes/no,btohqsg
"""life is full of failures but also full of overcoming"" - burette",btohqsg
