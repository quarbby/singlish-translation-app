i count my retire in wanton noodles malaysia price,btohqsg
When will be confirmed? I bought twin vew because of HSR,btohqsg
That's all I can share about Adventus  but thanks for the luck Furion. üôè,btohqsg
wait old man die first then say,btohqsg
The region where they operate and develop has been growing for years. Nothing new,btohqsg
SG Yuan are u there? Can provide ASTI charts please.üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Till they got forced out last year or the year before. Forgot,btohqsg
Anyway I did write up on adventus sometime back can search,btohqsg
Now discussion started again. Hope next year they finalize plan. Mahathir stopped it but this govt. wants to proceed. It will come down to finances. Still no certainty will happen.,btohqsg
I don't think it will benefit Asean much. Good for China. Free flow of China goods and services.Western countries with all their money and power cannot benefit much from Chinese Market due to how difficult China makes it to operate in their market. Asean countries have no chance.,btohqsg
That is the hope now. Hopefully it happens soon,btohqsg
that xia lan fatty of malaysia transport ministry still working or got sack already,btohqsg
see his face want to smack his smug look,btohqsg
When highlight is on hoi an developmentSo little emphasis on higashi,btohqsg
As the famed sayingSee where the puck is going,btohqsg
Yongnam already report loss for 3 consecutive yrs  and all latest projects YN gotten were at such low prices  how to survive.,btohqsg
Dumping low price to get projects only.,btohqsg
I'm still holding YN at high level. Soao liao,btohqsg
Yong Nam needs mega projects like Jewel  MBS  Towers etc. Else  without those mega projects  YN had to compete with local smaller scale steel contractors for MRT projects to sustain...,btohqsg
YN already became main contractor for some minor construction works and MRT construction work.. Which profit margin is little  and with so much safety requirements as well as add on Covid safety restriction  workers insufficiency  alot of costs for construction are already in the rising.. But contract pricing signed before Covid has to remain the same.,btohqsg
And with lack of mega projects now in Sg  main contractors will be scrambling to dive price to fight with smaller contractors for smaller scale projects. Cash flow prob now in construction field.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still holding YN from last time.,btohqsg
When John called and it ran to 89/90,btohqsg
Anyone using CGS-CIMB app? It‚Äôs down since yesterday. All blank,btohqsg

Ahh ok  then prob sgx problem,btohqsg
not low enough go join the shortists and short it to 1 cents,btohqsg
telsa jialat but alset will jialat?,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ alset is reverse telsa right someone say,btohqsg
The truth is nobody wants to start any projects during this stupid covid time. Rules and regulations are a taunt.,btohqsg
Exactly.. And with the restriction of workers frm foreign countries  companies can only make use of the current labour's in the market. And this is the time workers are asking for pay rise,btohqsg
And if don't rise  they will jump ship to another contractor.. It is wats happening.,btohqsg
Haha. I dont think you are from this field so dont assume,btohqsg
I am frm this field btw,btohqsg
No transfer letter  no way.Unless finished and wp expiring,btohqsg
WP can chose not to continue.,btohqsg
Haha employer can cut permit and send back,btohqsg
my friends from the trade saying same as larrycancel = byebye,btohqsg
Cut and send back do company no good  u still have to look for replacement,btohqsg
And we r facing rejection of returning S pass and WP from MOM,btohqsg
Engineers who left sg before Apr couldnt return... Esp frm India.,btohqsg
Not enough worker  work progress slow  then payment slow  income slow  cash flow getting tighter  cant tahan... Go bust.,btohqsg
So better turn to SGX penny stock ü§£,btohqsg
ya we got CEO there already,btohqsg
Covid cases surging again.. expecting medical and food to run again...,btohqsg
Good leh..small town.. but slowly those ang mo going there to make it bad,btohqsg
Then will sats and yzj run?,btohqsg
I think they run different direction,btohqsg
Actually I saw some buy signal of JT last Friday but didn't enter ..,btohqsg
JT if hold a couple months might move up. Set a SL and don‚Äôt keep watching everyday maybe better,btohqsg
