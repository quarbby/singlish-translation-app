Global Indices in sync to oil and crypto leading the group. BBs incredible indeed  flushed so many retailers to die recently.But  we can tell SGX pennies still lagging and one by one  we are seeing counter recovery.Expecting more games this coming week. Hopefully time to revenge the recent losses.,btohqsg
I believe this is a sure gap up and will easily open at least $0.028 Monday imo considering that- recent placees bought in $0.027 - $2.5mil worth- it’s the last remaining ‘active’ penny crypto counter- crypto bulled up yesterday 5-6%- pennies sentiments already recovering- existing $700k worth of convertible bonds at $0.060 makes this one interesting.- timely news catalyst when pennies starting to get hot.Actually  I won’t be surprised if they open over $0.030 on Monday too.DYODD/OSOD,btohqsg
My vv3 lots are all in chiller . Whether add more/TP etc  will decide on how it opens  come Monday too. Anyways  hope it’s another good week ahead,btohqsg
