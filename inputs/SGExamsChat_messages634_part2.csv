‘As society becomes more complex  we have more government and less freedom.’ Discuss.“Good government requires the courage to take unpopular decisions.” Discuss this statement with examples to support your answer.Consider the view that efficient government is more important than democracy.‘ The key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed.’ Is this a fair assessment?To what extent do young people in your society take an interest in politics?How far should religion influence political decisions?‘No politician’s reputation can survive the judgement of time.’ How true is this?How far should countries aim to be self-sufficient?Should the love of one’s country still be encouraged?As long as people in the public eye do their job well  does it matter what they do in private?Does the presence of a foreign power ever help a country with problems?Many developed countries are paying increasing attention to the needs of the disadvantaged? How far is this true in Singapore?,btohqsg

6. Too many historical figures are famous for the wrong reasons.’ Discuss. [History],btohqsg
I rmbr the cambridge comments for this paper,btohqsg
Was that it was very poorly done cuz everyone treated the famous for the wrong reasons as just like,btohqsg
"So the argument was very like ""even though we have bad people we also have good people""",btohqsg
"It wastoo many historical figures are famous for the wrong reasonsThen I agreeBP1: Since there are facts and evidence these historical figures aren't famous for the wrong reasons since their reasons are justifiableBP2: I talked abt revisionist historyBP3: We tend to remember  historical figures by their flaws and not their successes or contributionsBP4: Because we exist in a different Era from said figures and are not the figures themselves  our interpretation of the historical figures tends to be unreliable as a result since our understanding of them would purely be hypothesis of what actually happenedBP5: It would also be unfair to use the moral judgement of ""wrong"" as a fair way of understanding how historical figures behaved since we would be retroactively applying standards from the present to understand the past",btohqsg
I tried to unpack how wrong is a inherently flawed value judgement to use on humans,btohqsg
Then I also interpreted wrong as like incorrect lor,btohqsg
But tbf I feel like the only reason why I didn't fuck up this paper was cuz I had alot of examples,btohqsg
