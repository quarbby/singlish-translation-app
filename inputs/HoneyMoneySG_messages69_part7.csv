Hi guys  anyone knows the cheapest way to buy a first hand Samsung phone with all the warranty etc? Focusing on more about the platform/physical outlet rather than the credit card to be used,btohqsg
You can use the blocked DBS card method to verify each stall's MCC to be sure.,btohqsg
Super secure face verification to transfer even $1 üòÇ  Also welcome gift is a bunch of shopee vouchers. App is nice to use.,btohqsg
Shopee or lazada is preferred so u can check the various prices. Samsung  usually dropped price after 6months,btohqsg
Will there be any issues with regards to delivery of phone or warranty?,btohqsg
This u need to check the details go for 12 months warranty Samsung not in house ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Choco just revised tnc  anyone read?,btohqsg
Hi all  how many miles do i vet for booking flight ticket using DBS WWMC? Is it 10x per $1?,btohqsg
Dbs altitude using expedia got 6x per $1 spend?,btohqsg
dont save/invest with insurer. they eat u alive in fees. consider t-bills  high interest account (CIMB fastsaver) or money market funds (not capital guaranteed). if u wan to lock in interest for longer term  can consider Singapore Saving Bonds too.,btohqsg
Hi all  I transferred my fresh funds from DBS to my uob one account under FAST   ‚Äúpurpose of payment‚Äù: SALARY payment. Any idea why it wasn‚Äôt reflected on the app?,btohqsg
When u did that  it takes time to reflect,btohqsg
Usually how long does it takes to reflect tho? I did the transfer last night,btohqsg
Wait over weekend. Monday should reflect. Normally 1 working day,btohqsg
It works? Isnt fast transfer excluded from the salary crediting requirement?,btohqsg
do you guys know about those numbers that message you like a questionnare then pay you money and lead u to a telegram group?,btohqsg
those are illegal money laundering groups right?,btohqsg
Last time kelvin release a video on this. U can search it,btohqsg
its no longer working since yesterday,btohqsg
ü´† no free lunch in this world,btohqsg
those groups are illegal tho right,btohqsg
if not illegal then why don‚Äôt people just use the groups to their advantage haha  cuz they will send money then at a certain point will ask u to send them money. so just don‚Äôt send the money and leave with their money.,btohqsg
Point being you don‚Äôt know the source of funds from e.g can be money laundering   you get implicated  then bank freeze account üòÜ,btohqsg
If all of that just to earn $3.. well.. ü•π,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAH other time i did it was like $76 until they blocked me HAHAHHAHA,btohqsg
aiyah but too risky hahaha shouldn‚Äôt do,btohqsg
I don't think this works. You need to have transaction with the SAL code. If not everyone can just qualify for the salary component just by transferring cash in,btohqsg
maybe do a search for datapoints  u may be surprised,btohqsg

if i am getting 12k for company D&D gift purchase  mainly shopping at Tangs - which credit card should i use?,btohqsg
Before 1st Nov then can consider ocbc TI card.,btohqsg
Best to split among diff cards,btohqsg
If u talking about 0% interest instalment payment plan you should see instalment amount on your statement with a counter showimg instalment number out of how many months,btohqsg
"Hi guys  can i check if this is normal? As i already hit the level 2 criteria  but the logo seems to indicate ""pending""? This is the uob one interests rate indicator.",btohqsg

Hi ocbc titanium changed of policy. So starting Nov capped at 10k per month. Which means max spend under their eligible mcc would only be best kept st 2.5k right,btohqsg
4mpd for say lazada. It says capped at 10k $ocbc points per month. So 2.5k*4,btohqsg
