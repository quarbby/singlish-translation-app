Any miles card doesn’t require fee upon conversion?,btohqsg
but do take note the 3 year expiry starts immediately once the miles are credited to your krisflyer account at the end of each month,btohqsg
I pay a couple insurance bill using axs monthly. Should I use OCBC nxt to hit the monthly $500 spending or use Maybank Visa Platinum to get the $30 cashback.,btohqsg
You can top up grab wallet with PayPal?,btohqsg
does your insurance accept payment using the cards?,btohqsg
Nope. I can only pay using card thru axs,btohqsg
Maybe i should phrase my question correctly. Does paying thru axs counts for both scenario  monthly $500 card spending for OCBC360 and Maybank Visa cashback? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hello. If I have reached CPF BHS and FRS for 2023  can I request for CPF to rollover my full CPF contribution to OA instead of the current split between OA and SA? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi  may i know what's the next best card to use for healthhub? I do not have CRMC and WWMC. Only UOB PPV  VS  Lady  KF  HSBC Rev Visa Infinite & Amex HF.,btohqsg
uob lady which category u chosen?,btohqsg
Oh  my wife have chosen Dining and Family. That's where we can use up the full $3k.  Is there a category for lady card which cover healthhub/hospital bill?,btohqsg
If u have reached BHS  whatever surplus MC to MA will flow to SA. Since ur SA hit FRS  the funds will flow to OA.MC to SA  will still remain under SA,btohqsg
Have a question. I am going to apply maybank visa platinum to pay for all my insurance. The requirement for this card is to spend minimum 300$ monthly. Does insurance payment of 1500$ count towards the 300$ spend ?,btohqsg
Co-brand cards. There’s uob krisflyer also,btohqsg
$300 spend each month for all 3 months of the calendar quarter to get $30 quarterly rebate.$1000 spend each month for all 3 months of the calendar quarter to get $100 quarterly rebate.Insurance mcc not excluded. Does ur insurance company allow direct payment using VISA card?,btohqsg
just checked none of the categories covers mcc 8099.dun think healthhub accepts Amex. Think at most get 1x point on your visa/master. Apply new cards?,btohqsg
Yeah I tried searching and seems PPV also can't get 4mpd. Only option is probably Amex HF->GPMC for 1.8mpd. I will apply for CRMC / WWMC for future transaction. Thanks for response.,btohqsg
For the SMS for HSBC EGA  anyone knows if the SMS needs to come from your registered mobile number with HSBC? Or any number can since we are indicating our bank number in the text?,btohqsg

Oh? Wah ok let me try and update. Thanks!,btohqsg
may i know how long normally hsbc approved CC application cos mine already 1 week tia,btohqsg

@ Kavan : think EGA interest applies (for funds in account) is only for incremental  amount  not for the entire 2k insideFeel free to correct me if wrong,btohqsg

Mine about 1 month. Need to call to expedite,btohqsg
Can I check  normally does travel insurance cover cancellation of flight by the airline? Because I bought air ticket from Zip Air for 2nd April  I worried the flight got cancelled and I need to purchase a more expensive air ticket. Currently I haven't buy travel insurance yet  planning to purchase one just in case. Thank you for helping.,btohqsg
You need to get the travel insurance if I am not wrong within 7 days of ticket purchases for that to be covered. Better check the insurance policy. So usually I will buy the travel insurance immediately after purchasing the tickets,btohqsg
Mostly does cover but best check t&c before signup . A good practice is to buy travel insurance after you pay for your ticket,btohqsg
My partner's HSBC revolution card took a while to approve and mail to the house due to a surge in applications during that period  about 1.5 months,btohqsg
I thought it covers as long as the insurance is paid before the cancellation is known ?,btohqsg
I had called before. Need to be purchased within 7 days upon ticket confirmation. But I had checked this with Chubb the other time. Others might be diff,btohqsg
I see thanks for the info !,btohqsg
If not  that clause of ticket change of date or cancellation is auto excluded,btohqsg
Ok I will try to call and check  nowadays travel insurance is bought online  to have a better check  will u all call and ask the insurance company first?,btohqsg
Any recommend travel insurance company to buy from? Thank you.,btohqsg
This coverage is effective only:(a) if this Policy is purchased before the Insured Person becomes aware of any circumstances which could lead to the disruption of a planned Trip;,btohqsg
This is from my t&c from Etiqa travel insurance. So do check with the customer service officer or read the t&c carefully before purchase,btohqsg
Just avoid Starr Insurance. Had bought because they had some promo. But super bad exp during claims. Hotline no one picks up. Claim too almost 8 months to claim with no updates. Need to chase almost every other week.,btohqsg
Haha yes I did some research although very cheap but avoid at all cost . And some company underwriting that is from starr insurance too,btohqsg

As long as the statement incl SALA   salary or anything that indicate it’s salary . I think you can appeal to uob . I think your HR have done sufficient to show it’s a crediting salary,btohqsg
Ah alright will write in and let them know thx!,btohqsg
Hi  does UOB absolute card get cash back for donation? The web site accept AMEX payment.,btohqsg
dont think so  but need check the t&c,btohqsg
Any referral code for maybank visa platinum card ?,btohqsg
1) The first step is to temporarily block a DBS card via the DBS digibank app. You can do this by tappingMoreon the bottom right hand corner  then scrolling down until you seePayment Controls.Select the card you wish to use  then toggle the card lock option.2) Now go to the merchant and swipe your locked card (or enter your details online  as the case may be). The transaction will fail since your card is locked. That’s exactly what we want to happen.3) Return to the DBS digibank app or login to DBS ibanking and summon the digibot (for the app  tap the question mark on the top right corner and scroll down to tap “ask digibot”  for desktop  click the icon at the bottom right corner).4) Navigate toCheck My Recent Transactions> Dedit Cards>Select the card you used>View Transaction History>Declined Transactions,btohqsg

I have three miles cards - HSBC revolution  CITI rewards  UOB preferred platinumIs HSBC revolution the only card out of these three that can get 4 miles from airline tickets and overseas hotel expense?Most overseas hotel don’t allow Apple Pay paywave..,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if I made an online transaction for an attraction overseas  what mcc code will it come under? It will be in overseas currency. Also will still qualify for most cards eligible spend for cashback/miles?,btohqsg
Hi. Ask something. Uob lady's card use overseas like 7-eleven  familymart. These consider food?,btohqsg
Yup. But no reward for using it. 😅,btohqsg
Convenience store different mcc from food,btohqsg
Hsbc revo cc - get signup reward when a min of S$500 has been charged in Qualifying Transaction. I can buy capita voucher right? Or any other better way can share? :),btohqsg
revo card v gd? why everyone getting?,btohqsg
i guess currently the best card is citi paired w amaze right? but also wondering what yall other pair ur amaze card with other than citi,btohqsg
or is the only best strategy is amaze + citi?,btohqsg
Hello gurus  im planning to switch from cashback to accumulating miles. With an average expenditure of 400-600/mth  I am currently only holding on the HSBC rev + Citi PM for the occasional big expenses >$1k. This combo should suffice right?I may have to spend slightly more just  this month due to a family trip - would y’all recommend signing up CRMC+amaze just for this reason  or can just use Citi PM? After the trip probably won’t have such big monthly expense already.,btohqsg
Basic card to get cause no annual fee,btohqsg
amaze + citi is currently the best all rounder card. If you don't wanna bother with tracking your spending at all  this is a good card combo to get,btohqsg
Signing up for CRMC + Amaze will be beneficial. Not only you earn 4mpd on everything except blacklisted categories and exclusions  you also get 1% cashback from Amaze and a lower FX fee,btohqsg
Oo usually I just use HSBC revo 🙊,btohqsg
Can the 1% Amaze cashback be cashed out (like ShopBack)?HSBC Rev vs CRMC + Amaze differs mainly on us diff exclusions and whether need to pay Fees for FCY right,btohqsg
Where in app I can't find,btohqsg
Does it apply groceries and all dining?,btohqsg
Similar as in fuss free but there coverage is different eg hotel  airlines booking are via hsbc Revolution for the 10x rewards.,btohqsg
Annual fees wise can be easily waived,btohqsg
Both HSBC Revo and Citi Rewards give 4mpd. But Revo gives 2.5% cashback while Rewards gives 2.27%,btohqsg
Cashback is credited as InstaPoints  and you need 2000 points to cashout $20 to your Amaze wallet,btohqsg
3.5% if you have EGA acc? :),btohqsg
look like ega+revo better than citi+amaze,btohqsg
Yes. But do note that EGA also gives 1% on GIRO bill payments  so paying your Citi cards from EGA will also give additional 1% cashback,btohqsg
Both cards give rewards for both categories,btohqsg
we need a 1v1 compare 😭,btohqsg
Just see Chris video is sufficient information is readily available,btohqsg
Any cap on that 1 percent cashback ?,btohqsg
Which card cashback is better for public transport? Revolut or Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card?,btohqsg
I think it's a pretty high limit  around $30k spend per month?,btohqsg
Does using grab card   or grab food charges extra fee when in Malaysia?,btohqsg
Revolut 10% cashback  SC 6%. But SC has no requirements while Revolut has some conditions to fufill first,btohqsg
Or just top up SGD as in Grab wallet?,btohqsg
hsbc rev and amaze +Citi amaze both equally good must see your spendings  and where you spent this 2 cards can spent on most places,btohqsg
contact less  online and public transport,btohqsg
Can I check to have this giro cashback I just need account and maintain 1000 right ?,btohqsg
If you have Grab card you can't pay with GrabPay while in MY,btohqsg
citi + amaze = to online already,btohqsg
example you normal hp internet bills amaze+citi if buying air ticket then is hsbc rev,btohqsg
Every month $2k incremental balance + make 5 transactions per month,btohqsg
i dun think is incremental right just need to deposit $2000 then later take out okie right,btohqsg
I mean I top up money in grab wallet to for grab food n grab car,btohqsg
5 transactions as in transfer of funds to other acc also counted.,btohqsg
Oh this one I'm not sure. Try to ask Grab support,btohqsg
icic.. but only travel n public transport amaze+citi no gd,btohqsg
yupe  i think cruise is different citi amaze get points while hsnc rev dun give lols,btohqsg
Should be able to charge using grab wallet,btohqsg
I think cruise tix and onboard expenses are excluded for CRMC... ie no 10x points,btohqsg
okie check yupe cruise not counted also,btohqsg
like whether citi+amaze cover any area that revo don't? else can default to revo for everything mah,btohqsg
revo give you $1-1point no x10,btohqsg
No. Insta points only for FX spend,btohqsg
oversea use also okie  with amaze,btohqsg
hanoh.. revo for sg(except hp n Internet bill) .. amaze for overseas 😂,btohqsg
I was commenting that all CRMC + Amaze local spend gives 4mpd. But yes  only FX spend gives 1% Instapoints back,btohqsg
must see you monthly usage also dun have one for all de lar you need to come out with your own example if you always spent over 1k per month good to have 2 mah,btohqsg
if split up hor.. my individual card won't accumulate enuff pts to do anything ha,btohqsg
All will go in your kris flyer what,btohqsg
Just transfer in $2000  and fast transfer out 5 times $400 each time and that's all. In 1-2 days you'll get an sms that you are eligible for rewards till the end of the next monthBut the fall below fee is another question (need to keep min $2000),btohqsg
ocbc min already 3k to be real if cannot have this min balance you 4%5% really doest matter the work right?,btohqsg
I see people say deposit $2K a month is requirement  but you can withdraw or spend it,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I read from others,btohqsg
Did anyone face this problem when opening HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Not directly answering your question;Can try going down to their branch. I went down to the claymore branch yesterday at 4.45pm  close to their closing time. Only one person ahead of me in queue.This morning account ready alr,btohqsg
Oooh Jun Hao this sounds wonderful. May consider going to branch at 2+pm-ish (close to the end of branch closing time),btohqsg
They close at 5pm on weekdays for account opening  check on their website for individual branch timings in case it differs!,btohqsg
ECapitvoucher mcc applied to be excluded,btohqsg
Oooh they open till 5pm for weekdays. Holland V branch closes at 3.30pm though,btohqsg
Hi  do you know if xray scans are excluded as well? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Does anybody know if AXS accepts payment via Instarem?,btohqsg
Use FairPrice app to pay also. Order self pick up for grabfood  use xnap for QR code payment at hawker centre / coffee shop for those that have liquidpay.,btohqsg
Food and grocery - HSBC revoInternet bill + Shopee (StarHub  Disney + etc ) - CRMCPlus those app like Kris+ and xnap  cannot use CRMC   so have to use HSBC.So I think need 2 card. Because problem is CRMC + amaze is only current  you don’t know when Citibank will stop rewarding amaze like DBS  so it still better to use HSBC for daily.HSBC revo + EGA give extra 1% + 4 mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys do you know for TikTok shop what card should I use?,btohqsg
Overseas convenient store purchases- anyone know if they would typically fall under Grocery MCC?  Thanks,btohqsg
Combined with HSBC Revolution for travel related expenses,btohqsg
Sorry just to check when you say HSBC revo + amaze you mean you topping up an amount to amaze card to use? Cause if I not wrong amaze card can only link Mastercard which CRMC is able to do so.,btohqsg
Are you referring to Isaac’s msg? If so  he was trying to say everything use CRMC + Amaze and for travel expenses use on Revo itself.,btohqsg
Do y’all know anyway to earn cash back for paying insurance?,btohqsg
Can I did it so many times last time like a few months ago. But now grabPay card is dirt shit. Spending in Malaysia would say best to use Amaze > Citi Rewards. Above that limit  perhaps Revolut or Trust Credit/ Debit card.,btohqsg
Best to also check against general exclusion mcc for all Citi cards:https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
You may want to consider amaze>Citi for most spending  except for usual mcc exclusion for Citi cards. Then HSBC Revolution for travel related expenseUtilities and bills related  have to find cards with no limit spend  like SC smart card. Some use UOB one for all spend but that’s the CB game and requires constant spending for 3 consecutive quarters 🤣,btohqsg
Can also shuffle travel expenses to DBS woman’s card right?,btohqsg
Nope  trying to understand how amaze works for visa credit card.,btohqsg
Go to money-> Payment  you will see scan and pay. Try to explore the app.,btohqsg
oh  as both were talking about the same topic.Ya Visa and amaze has no link. topping up the wallet also does not have any use cases.,btohqsg
Anyone know if I link Youtrip w biz kris flyer card  will I still get the miles? Since grab nerfing it….,btohqsg
amex card? youtrip cannot be topped up using amex card,btohqsg
Oh… is there any alternative to grab wallet?,btohqsg
Looking to pay for uni school fees… what’s the best way to pay and get rewards?,btohqsg
Like can i Topup amaze with Citi rewards and pay online payment to school Tution fees?,btohqsg
only maybank and amex cards still rewards for education but considering the low rewards and high fx fees it may be better to just use say youtrip/revolut to avoid fx fees without any rewards,btohqsg
maybank visa infinite 2mpd  maybank platinum visa $30/$100 quarterly rebate if meet $300/$1000 spend for all 3 months of calendar quarter,btohqsg
I see. Thank you for sharing 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Amaze can only link to Mastercards only,btohqsg
Don't see it maybe I didn't applied for the savings account?,btohqsg
Yup you will need a savings account. The scan and pay is linked to saving account and NOT credit card.,btohqsg
Hi guys do you know for TikTok shop what card should I use?,btohqsg

wanna check if there is any card hack to tap on crypto dot com card now that uob cashback -> grab is no longer good.,btohqsg
believe the tncs will explain. and I believe the $200 is not credited immediately,btohqsg
Yup. Some wait afew days. But the tncs don't really explain much how/what can use for. That's y asking those who come across when applying the card,btohqsg
Then its pretty much $200 cash. Which you will receive within 60 working days from card activation,btohqsg
Anyone know if EGA + advance card  if spend on travel  air tickets above 2k get 3.5% cashback?,btohqsg

GREAT SP Series (GSP) Endowment Plan | OCBC Singaporehttps://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/insurance/great-sp-series.page,btohqsg
now there is a few FD is 4%   but if u dont need to lock your cash  can consider HSBC EGA,btohqsg
thanks but i cannot meet those criteria of spending. I am using UOB One to meet those criteria already,btohqsg
HSBC EGA u can park it for 4 months not much criteria lol... but if you want FD  HL  SBI and HSBC gives 4% but different tenor different sum different duration,btohqsg
sure no prob  if u need 12 months tenor can consider SBI 4% for 12 months min 50K  HL bank also got 12 months tenor but must have 100K,btohqsg
50 000 x 0.04 = $2000 for one yr,btohqsg

Hi guys! Can I double check if I use Amaze card pair with Citi rewards and tap it in restaurant and offline shopping do I still earn 10x points?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how we can get credit card miles for payments that require scanning of qr code such as paynow/grabpay? Is it only via cardup? Or can I pay via grab by scanning the qr code and paying with cc? Thank you!,btohqsg
In general  all benefits via grab already nerfed to almost nothing (best case 0.3%) from 4th Apr.,btohqsg
paynow is funded by bank acct not cc. qr nothing to do with cardup. grab qr need to topup grab  only 1.5% on amex tcb which will be nerfed wef 4apr then left 0.3% on uob amex absolute,btohqsg
Which mcc is Merchant Category: MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL MERCHANDISEUnder? Which card should I use for it?,btohqsg
Is there better credit card than Citi Cashback+ 1.6% for tour package purchase (~$6k total) from tour agency?Which MCC is it?,btohqsg
Amex true cashback card if you don’t have  ” Enjoy welcome bonus of3% Cashbackon up to S$5 000 eligible purchases within first 6 months. “,btohqsg
Yeaps but other than the these unlimited spending catergory  prob no other types that are suitable right?,btohqsg
I doubt so   as the amount is quite big . Will burst the usual cap of the 4mpd card,btohqsg
Interesting situation perhaps combination of a few credit cards like uob vs 4mpd  uob union pay 2%  hsbc advance 2.5%. Or if signup to amexPlat charge can use 10k for existing customers or 15k for new.,btohqsg
I didn’t consider that the merchant can spilt payment . If it’s possible then can use multiple 4mpd card,btohqsg
Agency should allow I guess but do share the results with us so we can learn too :),btohqsg
Can try BOC 3.8% or T Bill 3.98%,btohqsg
Hmmm would think that tour agencies wouldn’t allow split payments tho 😅,btohqsg
Then u pay me cash I use my card haha 😂 just kidding,btohqsg

Hello  if I’m paying for wedding banquet venue fee via online payment link provided by the hotel  which MCC code is it categorized under? Will it be considered as qualified transactions under these few credit cards?-Citi Rewards-HSBC Revolution-DBS Altitude-Stand Chart SMART-UOB KrisflyerThanks!,btohqsg
if im not wrong it would be classified as Hotels Travel  so Citi Rewards would be out of the option.,btohqsg
thanks for clarifying! i just signed up for citi rewards  UOB krisflyer and SCB Smart via moneysmart promo  so trying to clock the min spend to earn the rewards 😅,btohqsg
if possible would be HSBC Revo up to $1k  but if the hotel is able to allow you make payment online i think DBS altiude able to clock 3mpd with it up to $5k,btohqsg
SC smart payment forNetflixD+Yakun Macdonald KFC etc onlySimplyGoCiti reward + Amaze would be good for your oversea expenses excluding flight and hotel or travel relatedi think left over would be absorb by UOB krisflyer if you made $800 worth of purchase with SIA group can get 3 mpd uncapped,btohqsg
thanks so much for all the info. So i guess the $500 min transaction for SCB Smart card needs to be under these transactions as well to earn the rewards? - Subscriptions/Breakfast Joints/Public transport?,btohqsg
technically the $500 just need be spending  you can charge the wedding onto it but it not optimised as yeah only those lifestyle stuffs reward you 6%,btohqsg
the rest is only 0.3% if im not wrong,btohqsg
OH i see!! Ok i got it now. Meaning for the sign-up reward just need to clock the minimum spend. But to optimize the cashback/miles reward then follow the guidance you mentioned above 🙏,btohqsg
yeah correct  if they allow you to spilt the bill then it would be better. you can optimised your cards and soak up as many rewards point as possible.UOB Krisflyer is the best if you have already spend $800 on SIA group on that card than make payment for your wedding  as it the only uncapped 3 mpd card in the market,btohqsg
the rest have limitation  DBS altiude would be the second with a $5k cap monthly on Online Hotel transaction with 3mpd,btohqsg
wow thanks so much for the info it’s really useful!! appreciate it 🙏🙏,btohqsg

Good morning! Can I check if instarem amaze can be linked to the OCBC Titanium Rewards credit card? I saw that they are having some sign up promotion right now. Is it worth to get the card too? 😄,btohqsg
can. But only make sense to link to Amaze for overseas spend and save on fx fees and get 10x points only for specific MCCs.,btohqsg
no  only get base points 0.4mpd (unless there is promo e.g. 2mpd). Can use citi prestige/premiermiles for 1.3mpd/1.2mpd  but not sure worth the 2% fees.,btohqsg

It depends on the shop. Eg best Denki has a sign at their cashier counter informing what bank and the installment period. And min spend amt.,btohqsg
Thinking to use it to make payment for insurance,btohqsg
what is this bonus cashback means,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or Citibank Reward MasterCard Better?,btohqsg
It really depends . Both are very similar. Both have same limit,btohqsg
But HSBC revolution has less restriction,btohqsg
Both card cover dining & retail(Citi rewards need use amaze). Both card cover online retail .Area where HSBC does better : travel relatedAreas Citi does better : utility bills etc,btohqsg
Which card better depends on what you are using the card for.,btohqsg
Depends on merchant like court   best denki etc. By opting for installment  likely you wouldn't earn miles or cashback.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution bonus point system comes after one month. While Citi is awards the moment payment confirm . Easier to keep track .,btohqsg
Correct.If citi reward is primary card  you will use citi for everything  then use HSBC as secondary for travel.If HSBC is your primary card  you going to use it for everything  but citi reward only when you doing online transaction in foreign currency or when spending overseas.,btohqsg
Insurance policy none can do 12 months 0%. Most is with some fee or admin fee,btohqsg

The app can contain the ecapital value   got state expiry date one,btohqsg
It will be added to your ecapitavoucher balance in the app  can use it like cash and don't need to use the entire voucher amount.,btohqsg
Depends you going for miles / cb. For me miles  would use Citi Rewards or HSBC Revolution. For Cb  would use EVOL / DBS Live Fresh.,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks for the info. Wasn't sure initially if I had to spend it in a single transaction or if I could use it over multiple transactions,btohqsg

Hi  just wondering anyone been to malaysia via the e-gates for singaporean? Do we need to have a MAC for it or just submit MDAC will do? Thanks,btohqsg
Base on what I know  you need to submit the MDAC but the first visit after that  you will need to go via the Manual counter to register  need to inform them. it's only for activation but on that day must come back via Manual counter or you can try your luck with the e-gate. The following week each time before heading to Malaysia  submit the MDAC and try your luck with the E-gate. Sometime it works  something it doesn't from what I heard.,btohqsg

Anyone knows why my spend on the eligible card is $679 (using UOB EVOL)  but in the app  it’s $459.21?,btohqsg
All transactions have been posted as of today,btohqsg
Is your evol statement date align with uob one account?,btohqsg
One is cc bill cycle  the other by calander mth,btohqsg
Is some of your spends not eligible? Like utilities ? Can check evol terms and conditions for eligible spends,btohqsg
This was my latest (previous) statement date for EVOL,btohqsg
This is the current spend that i had incurred for EVOL,btohqsg
I don’t think they are the same dates..Does this mean to qualify for the Level 1 interest  the $500 spend has to be within my cc bill cycle..?Edit:My Evol statement date is every 15th of the month.My UOB ONE statement is by calendar month (end of each month),btohqsg
Hmmm I have checked and the spendings are within the eligibility categories 😅,btohqsg
tally the tracker with your UOB evol transactions posted in march only. (Note the tracker may have 1-2 days lag),btohqsg
Call them up to align your evol statement date with uob one,btohqsg
In the meantime manual track your uob one spending using posting dates,btohqsg

I not getting the $500 worth of interest based on the effective interest of 5%. I only get $300 plus. Anyone encounter this?,btohqsg
Hello  i just downloaded webull app & signed up. How to load even 1cent?,btohqsg
5% is annual. Monthly should be around $400 or so based on $5000 a year. I notice that the interest will vary depending on the days of the month. For Feb it will be lower due to fewer days.,btohqsg
u hold at least 100K average balance for the full 30days?,btohqsg
Account - Transfer - Deposit - Fast   the 4 steps in the app,btohqsg

Your Statement cycle is mid of last to mid of current mth based on Statement Date.

Not practical at all and still must pay AF. You're just attracted by the look and history.,btohqsg
U can elaborate your spending habit too. If a lot of fine dining then is ok. If it hawker and grab pay topics then no need amex charge la,btohqsg

don't think it really matters muchhttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.htmlgenerally most important is always paying your credit card bills/loan repayments on timequite different from the american credit score concept,btohqsg

Credit score not really used here,btohqsg

Charge whatever you can to DBS WW  and HSBC REVO  if you have DBS altitude card can charge the remaining there (earns 3mpd for hotels and flights - cap of $5k per month for this earn rate),btohqsg
Unless you going for a bank loan  credit score doesn't really make too big a deal here. Even if a credit card gets cancelled  if other cards you have still in use then no problem  credit score will be ok after a few months. But paying your card bills in full on time is important to maintain good credit score  and ensure one doesn't chalk up huge credit card debt.If applying for a HDB loan  so long as you're employed with CPF then all's goodHope this helps,btohqsg

Trust Bank gives 2.5% for some relatively easy conditions. Can also consider OCBC 360 instead,btohqsg

Hey guys  sorry to bother you but I really need your advice. Last month I applied for the Smart Credit Card SC  and now I'm thinking about getting CIMB to get $330. Oh  and a few days ago I also applied for Amex TCB. Do you think it's okay to apply for three credit cards in less than a month?Just to clarify  I don't plan on using CIMB very often; I'm mainly interested in the $330 cash offer  especially since the card doesn't come with any annual fees. Thanks so much for your help! 🥰,btohqsg
can u hit the minimum spend for all the cards?,btohqsg
can always just apply to find out  mostly quick anyway,btohqsg
I think we can meet the minimum spending requirement  especially since I'm also getting a supplementary card for my family.,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice! I was worried that applying for multiple credit cards within a short period might negatively impact my credit score  but if it's okay  then I'll go ahead and apply. :),btohqsg
If it helps in any way  request for a lower credit for each card,btohqsg
Will likely go down a lot in credit rating.,btohqsg
Oh  really? I've come across a few articles on this topic  and that's why I'm asking for your opinion to see if it's a common practice or not.Just to clarify  are you suggesting that I hold off on applying for another credit card until I hear back from Amex? And do you think it's better to stick with the two cards I have and not apply for any more? Thanks for your advice!,btohqsg

Another q is when i spend $800 in 2 months  bank give $300 back  the $800 spending if i understand correctly  i can spend on anything without any exclusion?,btohqsg
no leh they'll set it quite high then if you apply multiple cards in the same period of time it'll then be a high risk,btohqsg
Signing up for 5 cards with $50K limit each will dampen your credit score as opposed to signing up for 5 cards with a pre-set limit,btohqsg
Plan to visit Jakarta  mostly will take grab/gojek  order food online from grab/gofood  but things from  supermarket  with 5% rebate using Citi smrt  will this be the best cashback card to my case?,btohqsg
Wait for a few mths before applying more or like what Joshua say set limit.,btohqsg
Are there any better credit cards than HSBC Revolution Credit Card?,btohqsg
The host has many videos u can watch them first,btohqsg
228 cashback  is it rare for ocbc?,btohqsg
yes. OCBC usually don't care about their card holders and will not waive annual fees. they'll rather cancel your card,btohqsg
Ya  iirc it’s the first ever above 200$ I see. Usually max is like 128$ tops with like sign up with 360 bank account de,btohqsg
😂eh  cosidering to sign up even none of ocbc card attract me🤣,btohqsg
It’s good for no minimum spend/ no annual fees card and covers most daily use areas like dining  groceries  retail stores for 4mpd or 2.5% cashback.But if can hit 500/600$ + min spend  got other options like UOB one or UOB Evol or DBS live fresh etc which gives higher cashback rate. Even higher 800$ good also get OCBC 365 or UOB One  if you can bao your recurring telco and electricity bills de and get high cashback. Other banks except OCBC  not difficult to waive credit card fees so don’t be too bothered by it,btohqsg
does recurring payments for telco & utilities count towards the $500 minimum spend for the $228 cashback reward?,btohqsg
Morning guys  can I check if I have a family with 3 kids (2 toddlers+ 1 infant) and looking at family personal accident term plan    any suggestions?So far I saw ntuc income have,btohqsg
Hey guys  im applying the ocbc credit card promo thing ..Fllight bookings should be eligible right? Do you know whats the mcc for this purchase?,btohqsg
But even the 1x point was not credited too after the transaction is posted 😅. Not sure what’s wrong,btohqsg
So first mth of opening hsbc ega account and deposit 2k already considered as 2k monthly increment ? And for the first mth if I use 5 times my revolution card will considered as 5 transaction to entitled for the 1 percent cashback ?,btohqsg
Prefer Citi Rewards MC+amaze but up to you. SMRT works too just that it adds FX fee,btohqsg
