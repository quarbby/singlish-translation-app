You all know right? Damaged food delivery needs to return back to vendor . That applies for grab panda etc. But for llm they let customers eat and allow customers file for compensation,btohqsg
This type of case go court llm sure lose,btohqsg
How much did they deduct from u,btohqsg
Its normal... told u guys be careful of llm.,btohqsg
I ever got deducted 30+ for dried food etc chilli and stuff.. i dont mind u deduct what im asking for is price list of every item as i know its too much to claim me that amount. And furthur more customer ask to leave item outside house on the chair. Complete job at 11+pm. Tomorrow 3pm said item damaged. And llm call me saying i have to compensate of 30+ sgd. Hahhaa.. suck thumb lah... thats why i said.. be llm customer better. U gain alot,btohqsg
I will find the vendor   I want know money goes to where. If back to llm pocket they can close shop,btohqsg
Go back to the customer hse,btohqsg
Wtf  did u taken photo when drop off?,btohqsg
Whoever consumes the food gonna pay for food. Restaurant asking for compensation does this mean they prepare new food for their customer. Answer is no else I would have received call from restaurant,btohqsg
Then u should be quite safe with evidence of the instruction passed down.,btohqsg
I will find out where the money goes to,btohqsg
If compensation is for llm own pocket  then close shop. If for vendor   show me new food been made to their customer and if I paid for the claimed damaged food  shldnt it be mine since the compensation is a payment for old damaged food,btohqsg
So where is the food? Shit in toilet bowl..... Who shld pay? Why me? Food damaged ask me compensate then where the food?,btohqsg
Instead I compensate for ppl to eat?,btohqsg
Think can try to complain to MOM,btohqsg
Since this is abuse by employer,btohqsg
this lala app is not worth animore drivers got abused paid cut by 1/3 and drivers get 2/3 of paid compair to last years previous onwards.even perjob work load more then 1/3 extra from lastime job assignment.further more cost rises.its goes opposite way.,btohqsg
I tot no one noticed that,btohqsg
Last year fare was better. This year the fare went down. After cny even worse,btohqsg
Pay parking pay petrol end up earn how much only,btohqsg
I give up with lala already,btohqsg
Incentive also dont have. Say got mission. One mission also dont have. Even if have the mission like peanut like that,btohqsg
anyone who have a transport and want to sustain and rely on this app my advise from better forget u sustain of transport and let it go.,btohqsg
I totally give up on taking orders after cny alr,btohqsg
Pay like shit one thing  anything happen they will deduct money from you like our friend $100. I got deducted $16 out of $32,btohqsg
it true i believe that as i got deducted 58$ dollars before without my acknowledgment,btohqsg
Hi all.I have come to understand that many members here have multiple platforms to do their deliveries.And with the recent spat on unfair cases as brought up to the chat I will like to hereby reiterate that this group has no business or Personal relations to the company.This is an unofficial group  not in any affiliations to LLM interests.As such I will consider renaming the group to a more suited one one's where all platforms can be discussed in here.Suggestions will be welcomed in the main chat.,btohqsg
Got this one time. They suddenly deduct 25 dollars from me and reason they gave was late delivery. My phone batt died when i otw to delivery location. After delivering i went back home to charge my phone then i send delivered. That was like 30 minutes later. I pass the item to the receipient. Dk why i kena deduct. They didnt even give reason. They didnt even investigate. Simply just deduct.,btohqsg
I ride motorcycle and it was raining heavily. I unable to charge my phone as moisture was detected. Then kena deduct. The fare was only 15 bucks but i kena deduct 25 bucks.,btohqsg
Now delivery platforms business is very bad as compare to last year  other platforms price still remain no change but LLM price drop n reduce as delivery fee which cut price without mileages even lower than that. So be careful when you do LLM order,btohqsg
Few months later‚Ä¶ might have new legislation,btohqsg
Llm will likely become lanlan move,btohqsg
Prices have been dropping n dropping last couple of yrs liao,btohqsg
To be honest  previously llm prices were overly high üòÇ,btohqsg
It's not sustainable in the long run  they will lose customers,btohqsg
Back then during lockdown got demand so can high high,btohqsg
Now if they still want biz they have to reduce the price or else no vendor will want use them,btohqsg
But even then  still keep having many new drivers join ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
No point comparing with the past prices liao. Delivery prices nowdays is low this have to accept,btohqsg
Where got so many deliveries to justify high priceüòÇ,btohqsg

If price low and not worth it then don't do lor,btohqsg
No matter how much we boycott or say here  fare also won't go up,btohqsg
