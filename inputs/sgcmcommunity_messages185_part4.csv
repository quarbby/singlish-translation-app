so what now? Drop the warranty and change workshop?,btohqsg
If drop warranty  engine oil change still free?,btohqsg
Or stick with them then ask them don’t change engine flush?,btohqsg
This chart is based on 40k but I only use 15k. When it comes to car servicing does time period matter or mileage? So in this example  they estimated 2 years one would have driven 40k hence flush. Although time period hit but mileage haven’t  is it ok not to flush? Ignoring the warranty part,btohqsg
I think don’t matter much? Since only $20 n under warranty,btohqsg
I’m confused. You all say don’t flush  I’m assuming it’s the engine flush and flush braking? Or just mean engine? And braking flush is required?,btohqsg
I think just let them do to protect ur warranty,btohqsg
how long is the warranty? you want it right? do whatever is needed for warranty den,btohqsg
yes mileage or time  whichever comes first,btohqsg
Okay. Then battery and the rim change also?,btohqsg
not needed for warranty no need,btohqsg
Until Oct 2026. Not sure if the warranty is needed?,btohqsg

Feels like a lot of things excluded for warranty,btohqsg
rim u drive at highway no vibrate is ok,btohqsg

Think it’s the standard stuff. If wear and tear won’t cover,btohqsg

They flush me since the beginning of time,btohqsg
U bought for PHV or normal,btohqsg
Just to fetch baby around. Hardly use the car. Don’t know much about car also,btohqsg
If rarely use  can take risk consider drop warranty,btohqsg
But the free servicing still must give u,btohqsg
But go which worksho? And will they give me a servicing plan like this round need to do what  next round need to do what that kind?Can recommend me? Cause I not well versed with car like - oh 20k need do this do that or oh this one like not right need to change this part that kind,btohqsg
Meaning they shouldn’t charge me engine oil?,btohqsg

You go to which workshop? Can recommend?,btohqsg
Cheapest eo change in sg I think,btohqsg
And everything else other workshop ah?,btohqsg
Engine flush is normal but seems like flush too much for your usage pattern,btohqsg
Need to call a few workshops n see which one cheapest if u want to save,btohqsg
"Depends on whether you want to go AD workshop  franchise/""branded"" workshop  or independent workshop lor",btohqsg
Generally EO change about $100 for oil (usually 0W20/5W30/5W40 depending on your engine) + Labor and maybe throw in OEM filter FOC,btohqsg
Check t&c. Did they state for warranty to be effective  die die must go their auth workshop for servicing?,btohqsg
Or after X amt of servicing  u r free to go anywhere,btohqsg
Tbh PI car no warranty one  anything the PI throw in is a freebie/discount for your vehicle,btohqsg
If tnc is die die their workshop  then u gg,btohqsg
Ya but is on them right lol,btohqsg
PI original job is to just import for you only lol it's the value add that they offer,btohqsg
I think the savings from these can overhaul engine n gearbox already lol,btohqsg
Sheesh I should write amedium.comarticle about this lol,btohqsg
Bigger PI shld be more trustworthy,btohqsg
