Why be immune when you can be invincible.,btohqsg
is the vaccine so powerful that one vaccine can fit all variants??,btohqsg
they are wasting our time and their resources,btohqsg
It's like the influenza vaccine. It's called guessing,btohqsg
blud doing the house md method,btohqsg
it is not guessing there...there are only 3 types of influenza virus and they are only making an intelligent guess on which strain is it (and that is why it is recommended to jap 2x yearly) (sometimes once a year as it is the same strain),btohqsg
Even if it's a different strain if it uses the same pathways in general your body should mount a strong secondary response either ways,btohqsg
All depends on the shape of the viral antibody,btohqsg
And obv the amount of memory T and B cells activated,btohqsg
Then shld we be going for covid jab again,btohqsg
Will current vaccines protect you against the new KP.2 Covid-19 variant?As Singapore is seeing a new wave of infections  here's what you should know:https://str.sg/jMZQ,btohqsg
That last I heard of T body cells was like during covid where I watch a vid on how our immune system works,btohqsg
JUST IN:One person is dead and others injured after Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence on the way from London to Singapore.The aircraft was diverted to Bangkok and landed at 3.45pm local time.https://cna.asia/4bIuDCn,btohqsg

i think boeing 777 should be banned from flying,btohqsg
They say it's a decision issue with he pilot,btohqsg
It's like one of the most popular planes,btohqsg
boeing should stop murdering their whistleblowers,btohqsg
One of the reasons why Boeings stock remains untouched through all the scandals,btohqsg
gg i will be taking boeing 777 soon,btohqsg
but it is a 1.5h flight so TOUCH WOOD,btohqsg
Almost every American defense contractor does that,btohqsg
not the touch wood thing ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
When u going? I make sure to buy life insurance in your name just in case,btohqsg
coz the 787 plane need to wait at airport transit 4h (and it is at night so we were worried the lounges will be close and we stranded there no dinner),btohqsg
btw v out of context but sq just killed someone,btohqsg
it is not out of context,btohqsg
I saw it declare the emergency,btohqsg
apparently all the food also thrown to the floor,btohqsg
I was speculating either medical or suddenly random depressurisation,btohqsg
I guess it's medical but on a larger scale,btohqsg
I v interested to see the report on this,btohqsg
im not sure but i guess investigation ongoing so they never say what it is,btohqsg
whether is pilot fault or plane fault,btohqsg
but the thailand media say more stuff i think,btohqsg
i think it is more of plane fault coz SQ pilots are skilled,btohqsg
she act like she understand thai,btohqsg
Probably just declare as Force Majeure and move on,btohqsg
speaking of which I shld see if I can change my flight,btohqsg
there is such thing as google translate,btohqsg
