Other countries: it is easy to get a pcr test report without doing a pcr test.On arrival  the pcr test at changi is not the same pcr test as the one conducted at end end of SHN. Supposedly the end of SHN is more accurate. At least that's what the swapper told me.By then  it's already 14 days since arrival.btw I just finished my SHN few days ago.,btohqsg
