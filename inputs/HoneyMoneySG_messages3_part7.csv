Recently Chicken Genius mentioned that he can easily profiting from writing Tesla put. Perhaps you can ask him whether he recommend such strategy? And why he recommend or not recommend that approach?,btohqsg
its better to do a cash secured put on tesla since it is way above the 200 MA. any issues with the battery  factories or govt regulations can make its share price volatile. of cos can keep rolling the put too but need to prepare cash for taking in the loss first when u roll.,btohqsg
can consider a bull put spread also if wanna limit the risk of sell put but profit is also capped.,btohqsg
