I mean even if he does go to War I doubt the senate and the house will approve of it . ,btohqsg
but I don't think the US will initate war,btohqsg
like whatever might benefit them more as a single person  constituency or nation,btohqsg
also with Kamala we might also face similiar thing.,btohqsg
ya cause they're low-key feeding off other countries resources passing off as their own at this point,btohqsg
im not saying that it's only the USA that does it but i,btohqsg
As world leaders might not respect Kamala for who knows what reason and then they start a war,btohqsg
just look at Russia and Gaza,btohqsg
the Israel situation is crazy though,btohqsg
once you have a weak leader with no respect == war/madness .once you have a unpredictable leader == madness too,btohqsg
they're literally bringing everyone who are considered neighbours down,btohqsg
we are just unlucky that the US most prominent candidates are equally bad for in different sense,btohqsg
"i think it's more interchangeable for these both pointswith a seemingly ""weak"" leader who holds no respect and is unpredictable with their follow-up steps (==) war-like madness",btohqsg
actually i don't think it's that uncommon these days with such situations happening like the Harris vs Trump election but it's not as widely broadcast or covered across various news outlets,btohqsg
because with internal conflict in one nation or country and a bunch of external forces shaking the so-called indestructible forces of the nation..?,btohqsg
It’s crazy America even allowed a felon to be a presidential candidate,btohqsg
something you may not know in the 2020 elections  Biden outperformed kamala in every state,btohqsg
but then kamala became vp for biden  it just shows how irregular politics in america is,btohqsg
It's not irregular   it's when the rich controls everything .,btohqsg
And they do what they want .,btohqsg
anyways if people are afraid of war  fear no more i suppose,btohqsg
Especially since I've seen Trump supporters come in my university and try to start shit with students,btohqsg
Singaporeans will be fine  but he already has plans to cut funding for education  reproductive rights (think birth control) and mass deportations,btohqsg

hi!! has anyone attended cdac tuition? how is it like? im applying for it rn :),btohqsg
if you learn (aka study well) under normal teaching settings like class but more of a smaller scale (about less than 20 students in a class  at most) you'll see gradual improvement for yourself in the subject you're receiving tuition in,btohqsg
at least from what i know of cdac tuition back when i was able to get tuition from them,btohqsg
too bad they don't offer much to post secondary students,btohqsg
jc students yes but other than that  not really,btohqsg
thank you!! could I ask what subject you took with cdac?,btohqsg
i was a primary school student when i was actively taking cdac tuition (mainly chinese  english  math & science  lol)then i was somehow referred to one of their past tuition programmes in the past calledProject Excellencefor students in low-income families or households to be able to learn beyond the normal curriculum and unleash their limited potentialthough i think a lot of what cdac did in the past  has now been cut down a lot,btohqsg
you can try Challenging Math if you want to learn more harder math,btohqsg

Here are two translated Gaokao Geog qns  let's see how many get this right:The Bering Strait is 80km wide in a highly strategic location. Because of this  there have been proposals to build a tunnel or a bridge across it. The following questions are based on these proposals:Q1. The construction of the Bering Strait bridge or the undersea tunnel will be conducive to (...)1. greatly shortening shipping times between the Asian and American continents  thus furthering trade between the two continents.2. promoting the growth of the Pacific Rim Economic Belt3. Enhancement of material and resource flows between the U.S.  Russia  and Canada  and the export of U.S. and Canadian sources to Russia.4. Promoting economic development in the Russian Far East and the U.S. state of AlaskaOptions:A. 1 2  and 3B. 1  3 and 4C. 2  3 and 4D. 1  2 and 4Q2. What is the main reason such a bridge or tunnel cannot be built currently?A. Technology has not yet matured enoughB. Infrastructure on both ends (e.g. roads) cannot yet support such a crossingC. Conflict between the US and RussiaD.  Scarcity of population and labor force,btohqsg
Me when I have to ask my parents to sign my report book with shitty P3 results.,btohqsg
Q2) B due to all the other factors' involvement ( national conflicts  technology disadvantageousness  lack of labor forces ),btohqsg
Both answers are wrong  the correct answer is D for 1 and B for 2,btohqsg
your answer for 2 is right,btohqsg
trick questions in the gaokao be like,btohqsg
i mean.... it's part of the reasons,btohqsg
if i actually took this gaokao geography paper  i'd probably just get an eraser and write A B C D or 1 2 3 4 on each side of it before sneakily throwing the eraser dice to the questions i face self-doubt  getting stumped over,btohqsg
if it's not obvious  im more of a creative linguistics person,btohqsg
i think a lot of people want to know more about that,btohqsg
wtf how come my thought process works better in gaokao,btohqsg
i got multiple Bs and Cs for N(T) exams and flunked my NA exams entirely,btohqsg
do you remember studying Bering Straits in geography,btohqsg
Combined Elective Geography did not have this topic,btohqsg
Only Plate Tectonics  Weather and Climate  Tourism and Food Resources,btohqsg
exam questions in sg academic settings are never too sensitive in the formatting,btohqsg
i don't understand why some questions have the most random answers,btohqsg
especially if it's not explained step by step in the answering,btohqsg
like the thought process  i suppose,btohqsg
but meh we aren't students taking gaokao,btohqsg
1 is correct  2 is wrong,btohqsg
i am sure 2 is correct 🤣,btohqsg
The answer they're looking for is B,btohqsg
at first  i thought so too 🤣🤣,btohqsg
See   while the conflict is a reason  the main reason they were looking for is that both regions do not yet have the infrastructure for it.,btohqsg
the options all seem like it makes sense,btohqsg
(also Gaokao reserves questions meant to involve political factors for essay questions  I'm not sure if this is the case when it comes to O-levels geog curriculum),btohqsg
nope sg geography curriculum doesn't even have much politics involved in the questions formatting set by SEAB in exams,btohqsg
Only Plate Tectonics  Weather and Climate  Tourism and Food Resources,btohqsg
Those answers have different weights of like main/root reason  sometimes those questions wanna root but u chose a main as answers,btohqsg
I think this more leans towards O level Social Studies than O level Geog.,btohqsg

Why waste progressive talent like time walz if you're not going to be a progressive message at the top of the ticket,btohqsg
And why is the Democrats demonising immigrants,btohqsg
Immigration is a GOP point  then you're going over here essentially saying YEAHH they're right the GOP is right on it..,btohqsg
We the Democrats also believe their talking point!! We provide no progressive alternative.. atleast on immigration hillary wanted pathway to citizenship,btohqsg
Funny thing is  the Democrats are now saying they didn't go far right enough..,btohqsg
Americans don't care abt gay rights  trans rights and culture war shit..,btohqsg

Here's an example of an A-Level geography essay based on your question:---### Essay Question""Discuss the factors affecting river channel morphology in urban areas.""### IntroductionUrbanization profoundly impacts river channel morphology  changing the natural processes of erosion  sediment transport  and deposition. Unlike rural rivers  which are more influenced by natural factors  urban rivers are highly affected by human activities and artificial modifications. This essay will explore three main factors that affect river morphology in urban areas: increased surface runoff from impermeable surfaces  channel modifications and reinforcement  and altered sediment loads from construction and pollution. Each factor plays a significant role in shaping the physical characteristics of urban river channels  often resulting in narrower  deeper  and more uniform river profiles.### Paragraph 1: Increased Surface Runoff from Impermeable SurfacesUrbanization increases the proportion of impermeable surfaces  such as roads  buildings  and pavements  which hinders infiltration and accelerates surface runoff. This heightened runoff increases the volume and speed of water entering river channels  particularly during storm events  leading to more frequent and intense flash flooding. Consequently  riverbanks experience more rapid erosion due to the higher energy flows  which can deepen and widen the channel over time. The increased discharge also reduces natural deposition processes  altering the river's ability to self-stabilize. In cities like Los Angeles  these effects are evident  where channel morphology has been reshaped to handle increased runoff through artificial means  diminishing natural variability in river forms.### Paragraph 2: Channel Modifications and Bank ReinforcementsIn many urban areas  river channels are modified to manage flood risks  prevent property damage  and improve aesthetic appeal. Techniques such as channelization  where rivers are straightened and sometimes lined with concrete  are commonly used to increase flow efficiency and reduce flooding. However  these modifications reduce the river’s ability to meander naturally  creating a more uniform and less diverse channel profile. Bank reinforcement with materials like concrete or steel also restricts the river’s natural erosion and deposition processes  leading to a loss of ecological habitats along the riverbanks. For example  the channelization of the River Thames in London has led to a highly controlled channel with limited natural adjustments  showing how human intervention significantly alters natural river dynamics in urban settings.### Paragraph 3: Altered Sediment Load Due to Construction and PollutionUrban rivers often carry increased sediment loads due to nearby construction activities and pollution  which can drastically alter the morphology of the riverbed. Construction sites contribute loose soil and other materials to stormwater runoff  increasing sediment deposition downstream. This excessive sediment can change the channel's depth and flow patterns  as seen in rivers near rapidly developing cities like Shanghai. Additionally  pollution from industrial discharge can introduce chemicals and waste that further disrupt river morphology by killing vegetation and weakening riverbanks  making them more susceptible to erosion. These processes lead to a river channel that may become more shallow and wider  affecting flood capacity and changing its ecological characteristics.### EvaluationIn evaluating these factors  it is clear that urban river morphology is primarily influenced by human interventions that seek to control water flow and prevent flooding. While natural factors like rainfall patterns still play a role  urban rivers are shaped predominantly by artificial modifications  particularly in highly developed regions. The combined impact of impermeable surfaces  channel modifications  and increased sediment loads results in a highly altered river morphology that differs significantly from natural rivers. Therefore ",btohqsg
effective urban river management must balance flood control with ecological restoration efforts  aiming to preserve natural processes while accommodating urban development.,btohqsg
but i eel like there isnt enough content for the impermeable surface part sia,btohqsg
Channel morph simply compare sediment regime discharge and human activities,btohqsg
affecting volume of flow is it,btohqsg
Climate affect discharge--> Urban heat island effectSediment regime --> lesser cause of more impermeable surfaces etcHuman activities --> channelisation of rivers to meet urban demands etc.,btohqsg
fml the UHI is so stretched,btohqsg
But u should still discuss discharge,btohqsg
i hope this doesnt come out,btohqsg
Cause it's explicitly in the syllabus document,btohqsg
im gonna make tis the h2 geog chat,btohqsg
sorry that i take an arts subjet which paper is in 7 days  clearly not as impt as others,btohqsg
Unless admins can come in here and explain how the content discussed in comparison to what other people have mentioned,btohqsg
maybe is just i take geog lol,btohqsg
EspecialLt cause its not the first time V went through and nuked all the content related discussion,btohqsg
once again  it's relevant  but it can very quickly evolve into chit chat. if y'all can keep it on topic  I don't mind.I agree with all the screenshots y'all sent that it's irrelevant  and if the mods are online we will take actionif y'all see such irrelevant content  you can ping us too,btohqsg
dyt enso will come out again,btohqsg
yea like the whole process + hadley and STHP\,btohqsg
one part a one part b,btohqsg
When the qn says GLOBAL ATMO CIRCULATION irs specifically abt hadley,btohqsg
if you want me to explain any moderation action taken or not taken  feel free to screenshot and send it here,btohqsg
delete alr how to take ss,btohqsg
Issokay there's way too many LOL like the olympiad talk,btohqsg
can ping me if it happens again,btohqsg
And people hedging all their responses with like mindless intros,btohqsg
"""I'm supposed to be studying for PW""",btohqsg
But let me do this for you,btohqsg
@Randkmdkdx4@chemcerFor the record  these are the ones other than the pure chat messages I deleted; the questions you claim I deleted aren't in there,btohqsg
ok so ure saying the fact that i stated that the content that was tested last year,btohqsg
is not releavnt to a levels,btohqsg
tell me geo9morph and tropical climate is not on the syllabus doc,btohqsg
and i will stfu for good.,btohqsg
find on the 9751 syllabus doc rn,btohqsg
unless the matter of fact im taking another a levels,btohqsg
tell me how the hell it isnt relevant,btohqsg
I would just like clarification as to why when an admin previously asks qns unrelated to a levels stuff those don't get deleted but suddenly it gets deletedUnless they playing moral high ground la. Last time when I was answering qns also in the o level chat I also got muted lol,btohqsg
so flooding hydro and climate is not related to a levels too?,btohqsg
Then why did huixin have to reask the qn here,btohqsg
oh so my tys is a lie la,btohqsg
Channel this anger into studying ur h2 geog,btohqsg
fluvial is not in a levelsb is it,btohqsg
is it just cause i take h2 geog,btohqsg
come out and say smth la,btohqsg
oh i dont know maybe its,btohqsg
repeated in my syllabus doc for 4 times /,btohqsg
mayybe i analyse every question in the past years to guess whats onna come out for p1?,btohqsg
That’s because V is not going to share the screenshots where randkmdkd sent messages about h2 geog content and explanations which he deleted. Why would V want to implicate himself for a mistake on his end? Of course he will only produce the evidence that supports his claims to try and cover up those messages that he deleted which he shouldn’t have. Can’t expect him to be unbiased,btohqsg
Gurl focus on ur h2 geog I doubt ur gonna get any satisfying answer,btohqsg
bro he has offically triggered all my anger,btohqsg
im sitting in the lb smashing my keyboard,btohqsg
Ok so this is not a level stuff is it,btohqsg
Nah I feel like this just turns the discussion into he say she say lolI think the fact that we were having a fruitful discussion about specific content but those got nuked so we had to pivot here is alr telling enough,btohqsg
We basically rehashed the same content LOL,btohqsg
ok lor guess h2 Geog people are jay not human,btohqsg
where there are instances of that happening  I apologise for it. again  we should be applying our rules uniformly  and those rules apply to both community members and moderators alike,btohqsg
Guess school consultations that do the same are wrong also,btohqsg
These were q some time ago,btohqsg
So its not a big thing,btohqsg
It's stuff that V used to say,btohqsg
U do alr u scared what,btohqsg
Which are along the same lines of what happened jn,btohqsg
scared my syllabus doc Actl hv is it,btohqsg
so means spotting is chit chat la,btohqsg
im personally looking through the deleted messages,btohqsg
not asking a level content questi9on la,btohqsg
h2 geog dont deserve it la,btohqsg
this chat becomes new national exam chat? 😅,btohqsg
Yeah cause all the h2 geog content got nukes in the a levels chat cause its not exam related or studies related,btohqsg
@Randkmdkdx4maybe just cannot discuss geog lor,btohqsg
Then the admins haven't reallt clarified why what she discussed isn't allowed yet,btohqsg
tele mod log not the best :),btohqsg
So we pivot to here temporarily cause later everything get deleted again in the other channels,btohqsg
I think its more of just V,btohqsg
I rejoined just to see the drama,btohqsg
u shud see what i send ontop,btohqsg
I would recommend drawing cause it's clearer,btohqsg
And don't need be super detailed,btohqsg
Just make the key points obvious,btohqsg
Like for example if ur comparing the line graph portion then just sketch the line graph don't need sketch the bar graph,btohqsg
ok ah so personally as a moderator  stuff like this is okay  as long as it doesn't go off topic,btohqsg
but when it becomes stuff like this is when it's gets on the other side of the line,btohqsg
and in a sense this is what i mean by it gets off topic really fast,btohqsg
There should’ve been more that was deleted below iirc,btohqsg
yes  my screen is only this big HAHA,btohqsg
i wldnt call this relevant too,btohqsg
There was still even more that was deleted iirc,btohqsg
there was an explaination that was deleted,btohqsg
Actually why isn't this relevant cause she's asking abt some content for geogThen I Need to clarify exactly what she's asking abt so I can help her,btohqsg
I think randkmd typed some explanation with a few lines about the theme 1 geog questions which was deleted,btohqsg
U don't even need the bar graph imo,btohqsg
Just the limbs and flow is it,btohqsg
This is just us expressing confusion,btohqsg
So its not relevant lol but it's an instinctual reaction,btohqsg
I get why it got deleted,btohqsg
"I did not delete any question saying ""what is drainage basin water cycle""",btohqsg
Yeah cause normally hydrograph qn got two types1. Compare hydrograph2. Explain hydrograph,btohqsg
then 'v deleted message' is who,btohqsg
There should’ve been one where I said “wait wtf is happening??”and I recall around then randkmdkd sent the messages explaining more about the dbwb,btohqsg
I think I need get a new pair of specs again ah after just getting one,btohqsg
Draw hydrographs to compare this trend,btohqsg
So for example if uw to compare lag time u draw two line graphs with 2 diff lag times,btohqsg
what did v not have a username so no one can ping him,btohqsg
master at running away from his problems ah,btohqsg
. Find me:1. Drainage basin2. Geomorphologic process3. Tropical climates is not presentIf u can in this doc  I will eat the doc,btohqsg
thought v got smth to say,btohqsg
Oh I love the great War x you're losing me mash up also,btohqsg
watch out later this gets deleted,btohqsg
This one not a level chat,btohqsg
Tldr this chat only for answering practice qns that other ppl ask lol,btohqsg
Ok wait I guess since I’m here I might as well ask when exactly did you drop out and started self studying again,btohqsg
how the hell do ppl have admin powers and get away with the mostly weird + inappropriate actions,btohqsg
if it's a discussion generally on some national exams  should be fine what,btohqsg
So I guess a lot of things are now irrelevant huh  if ppl ask qns but they’re not from an exam then it’s not relevant alr,btohqsg
Oh actually why did u drop out tho,btohqsg
@IcedMiloi'll be my fav order can,btohqsg
I'm not sure anymore but admin say,btohqsg
We can't really go against it,btohqsg
admin or whatever authoritative powers might say doesn't always mean 100% quite literally,btohqsg
If that were the case lots of other messages should’ve been deleted  like more than 50% of the entire study chat,btohqsg
rach i spotted both p1 set text essay qn for lit,btohqsg
like how people always say NO means NO but there's always special situations that work on a case by case scenarios,btohqsg
Ok just try to make it concise I guess,btohqsg
seeing it happened quite a while ago  not surprised,btohqsg
i hv 7 days to study for a,btohqsg
a lot of weird shit happened earlier prior to the few sgexams active members' disappearance due to various reasons,btohqsg
so a lot of stuff are only resurfaced now,btohqsg
like more older stuff i guess,btohqsg
Continue to ask randkmdkd lol although I won’t ever know for sure  I think he might have made the difference between me getting an A over a B for geog,btohqsg
If uw I can dig up some of my notes and send,btohqsg
Nah ur just humble  like 93% for geog prelims is pretty much unheard of,btohqsg
What's the definition of centripetal acceleration taught by yall sch? My sch didnt rlly give us a defn,btohqsg
Idk how u do it lol,btohqsg
Cause it's not abt a specific exam qn,btohqsg
Which memeline said must be the case,btohqsg
but materials sent by you and ppl in the O/N/A level group chat are pretty helpful,btohqsg
She said can't ask for concept clarification,btohqsg
discussion abt how to get the answers ... like ^,btohqsg
No cause now the only qns u can ask must be like,btohqsg
Tldr this chat only for answering practice qns that other ppl ask lol,btohqsg
But this isn't a practice qn,btohqsg
isnt definition qn a practice qn,btohqsg
But when I asked what is DBWB,btohqsg
Oh so qns related to like,btohqsg
"""Possible qns that can come out for a levels""",btohqsg
i like to think those questions you're talking about are questions people want answers specifically catered to how they see topics as,btohqsg
I think that's what some people were confused about,btohqsg
Cause the way u made it seem was likePeople can only ask qns related to homework or things that schs have set before,btohqsg
"then ppl always are like ""how to do this kind of question"" afterwards",btohqsg
why is everyone but v answering ah,btohqsg
the person that commit the action own up and say lah,btohqsg
suddenly v got alot of reps,btohqsg
I think cause he/she/they in cambridge,btohqsg
"feels more like discussing concepts are allowed but if someone were to ask ""how to do""  ""why does the answer scheme work accordingly as such"" and ""what is the concept behind this type of question""",btohqsg
sg public libraries having a better system compared to sport complexes using the activesg membership system is wild,btohqsg
its a good sleeping sppt ngl,btohqsg
last time studied hadley was two years ago,btohqsg
To me hadley is just a,btohqsg
12m qn --> explain how hadley cell influence rainfall,btohqsg
They won't ask abt formation for essay,btohqsg
yes  as long as the answer is to the point and doenst go off topic,btohqsg
Impt pts is alwaysITCZ --> Contribution to HumidSTHP --> Contribution to aridShifting of Hadley --> contribution to monsoons,btohqsg
Rest is more or less don't need,btohqsg
copy paste from a level chat,btohqsg
Is not gonna let you sleep better at night,btohqsg
It's not gonna help u get an A for h2 geog,btohqsg
When they wanna reply they'll reply,btohqsg
if anything is gona be my downfall,btohqsg
just focus on your paper la,btohqsg
ok goodbye im gona study geog locked in tag me if he does lol,btohqsg
Yeah don't obsess with this V witchhunt,btohqsg
you have plenty of time to be upset at others later,btohqsg
remember your grudges  hatred and issues with others but don't waste your life over them,btohqsg
Forgive but don't forgetMe when my friend told me thay his friend called the police to shutdown his event in hongkong,btohqsg
Nah just something my friend told me,btohqsg
i finally found a walking entrance to this dumb mall (IMM) after reading through all this,btohqsg
IMM is such an ancient mall,btohqsg
the scenario you took reference to  is wild though,btohqsg
anw if anyone still has any unaddressed concerns please raise it up here while i'm still online,btohqsg
It's rhe first thing that popped in my mind,btohqsg
surprised it's still existing and quite popular,btohqsg
but like i feel not that active leh,btohqsg
i only go IMM if i'm looking for specific shops,btohqsg
not active when you look at IMM alone but if you look at other malls of similar infrastructure (bulk selling leftover products of luxury brands at cheaper prices than the original  how big the mall  where it's positioned like in the middle of 2 other malls around the area etc) it's not bad already,btohqsg
if i were to look at somewhere else like tampines area.. good luck,btohqsg
century square  tampines 1  tampines mall  our tampines hub,btohqsg
what the hell is the difference between all three  not even the residents can tell the differences,btohqsg
it's quite active as a town area but when you look at specific malls within tampines  you realize that they aren't even able to compete with malls that look like they're much less active than them,btohqsg
yep this is also one of the reasons,btohqsg
One Punggol also works somewhat similarly like OTH,btohqsg
Actually tbf tampines is a crazy area,btohqsg
Yeah it's judt a multifunctional space,btohqsg
But aren't they planning to develop jurong to parallel tampines,btohqsg
They recognise that jurong and tampines are in the middle of no where so they need to be properly developed,btohqsg
west side is trash connectivity wise,btohqsg
But woodlands can go kill itself,btohqsg
Wym the east has 3 potentially 4 lines serving thay area,btohqsg
JRL is borderline useless unless they want to make jurong and CCK/BB an island on its own,btohqsg
Wym JRL makes NTU easy to get to nos,btohqsg
well yes but it's still a shit journey to get to boon lay in the first place,btohqsg
But ur not wrong I feel that CRL will be the best addition to,btohqsg
yk what wld be the best addition to the west rn?,btohqsg
JRL extend to HPV  then complete the circle,btohqsg
Who tf does TEL help except the rich people,btohqsg
Which are arguably also the rich people,btohqsg
Why do we need 3 mrt lines for marina bay mrt,btohqsg
it's not even that well connnected lol,btohqsg
then waiting time machiam tuas link,btohqsg
It's really for the rich/tourist people,btohqsg
It allows people to go marina barrage easily,btohqsg
TEL is ok la tbh  I think tbh connects alot of the rich areas but at the same time it connects alot of woodlands and the surroudning areas to the south btr,btohqsg
and TEL will also help airport connectivity for the north ppl in future,btohqsg
Yeah it makes sense for the northern part but the further down u go it's like why do we need a station here,btohqsg
And CRL would help more people also and relive pressure on circle + East coast,btohqsg
To me I benefit from both,btohqsg
im gna MIA and do smth else,btohqsg
my tag v easy rmb ok@IcedMiloanything tag me ok dun fight,btohqsg
How to transfer to TEL from Tampines?,btohqsg
TEL in the future will extend from sengei bedok to tanah merah,btohqsg
iw my milo nua and warm,btohqsg
taking over EWL from changi to tanah,btohqsg
so can trf to DTL at either sungei bedok or expo,btohqsg
If urban reimaging doesn't come out this year,btohqsg
I’m gonna eat don’t trauma me,btohqsg
i think your table gna cry,btohqsg
Yea o wanna be a superpower,btohqsg
If I change my username to icekopi can I be admin,btohqsg
Is YT taking every exam  pulling up the moderation in the process?,btohqsg
oh no no more ice milo,btohqsg
What if I do a Geog major,btohqsg
Then go take h2 Geog again,btohqsg
i can't remember who has bedok not spoken to  that doesn't have issues with him OR inexplicable emotions towards him,btohqsg
does daiso @ IMM not sell anymore red maple syrup,btohqsg
Why is bedok teaching bio in the alevel chat,btohqsg
he’s taken most subjects at this point,btohqsg
Hi!  A year 2 student here about to do her internship in year3 sem1I just got shortlisted for a research intern position at saw see hock school of public health at nusSo I want to know what are the possible questions they could ask during their interview!!Any help is greatly appreciated ☺️,btohqsg
I’m curious: does the most recent msg by Kel make the cut?,btohqsg
I typed a long msg earlier to say that the uneven enforcement can be as frustrating as over-enforcement,btohqsg
And how it is a bad look when the explanation of action by one has to be done by others,btohqsg
I typed out the entire msg. Read and read again then self-censored,btohqsg
because the proposed area of stations which the TEL mostly serves are stations that were already outlined from two former train lines that never came to existence in the early 2000sBasically they alr had the plans to serve that part of singapore as early as 2001,btohqsg

i had a poll recently. he voted for everything,btohqsg
