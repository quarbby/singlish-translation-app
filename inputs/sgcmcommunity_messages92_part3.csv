I’m paying off my own $213 debt from bank .. still have $17.82 left. But bank say still willing to lend me $50 more if I need,btohqsg
and to answer if the credit company aka house loan  it all depends on how much u loan,btohqsg
anyway  i tried and it failed,btohqsg
and the inhouse will inflate the selling price of the car,btohqsg
Only Admin E does that haha - E,btohqsg
But then it's a two-seater tho :(,btohqsg
They should give you better deal coz they get incentive from bank,btohqsg
but i first timer.. so damn naive,btohqsg
i will be smarter and know what to get the next time,btohqsg
anyway  my ah lau is saying to review one year late,btohqsg
But your car you never low dp right,btohqsg
That’s what we are here for.,btohqsg
Okay so if you sell also won’t be a problem,btohqsg
haha...novice will need to pay for tuition fee,btohqsg
and also to lower the monthly repayment figure  hopefully,btohqsg
A lot of lao jiao here who can help buyers or sellers like you avoid pitfalls,btohqsg
Cannot cover all ground coz one can never say never but we try lah,btohqsg
Wah so if inhouse they will up the car price ah,btohqsg
it all depends how much you gonna loan and how much dp,btohqsg
if u can come up with like 30percent of dp  naturally the loan amount will be lower and they no need to inflate the price,btohqsg
But if i pay lesser than that,btohqsg
I almost read Lao as lan,btohqsg
They will play with the price ?,btohqsg
Like increase the price of the car  because you pay less than 30,btohqsg
To help you get bank loan for low dp,btohqsg
And that also means they will increase the interest percentage higher than if i were to pay 30 percent,btohqsg
What is the car interests rates these days? 3%,btohqsg
bank loan is 2. something right?,btohqsg
but different in house  diff rates,btohqsg
so if the car dealer knows a few credit facilities  tell him'/herto try all of them,btohqsg
So we should be seeing lesser cars registered unless there are really many cash rich folks buying without taking up loans,btohqsg
yah diff. urs 3.xx low alr  i hear some is close to 4% or 4.xx,btohqsg
But in house the interest is fixed throughout your repayment period or does it change,btohqsg
Based on the contract  fixed upon sign-up,btohqsg
Lucky my previous car and current car under Hong Leong... that time on April my current car was under promo of 1.68% or 1.78% under Hong Leong...,btohqsg
buying car now is almost like buying a house,btohqsg
Yeah man... I bought used vezel was depre under $11k and monthly was $843...,btohqsg
except that car loans are not compound interests,btohqsg
now can buy house meh? 1million dollar HDB nowadays...,btohqsg
Yup... must see the interest high or low... machiam stocks...,btohqsg
no meh? the interests rate so hiong,btohqsg
Welp   dk in like 5 years how the market is gonna be like,btohqsg
those who predict that coe will come down next year  hopefully the rates will follow downwards also,btohqsg
Heng nia... now used one depre already up from more than $12k and above... mine was 2016 Dec car...,btohqsg
It is already calculated for the period in compounded factor,btohqsg
"almost every sales person i see kept saying ""we foresee the coe will keep going up""",btohqsg
i buy an elantra in 2020  monthly 611 only,btohqsg
Used cars are priced based of current COE right because since coe so high the used car demand also high,btohqsg
wa now buy car is the worst time..,btohqsg
Hopefully whatever car i want still exist when i can afford one lol,btohqsg
