CGS-CIMB technical buy call on Medtecs released this morningSince hitting a record high at 1.98 in August  price has been stuck in a severe correction  falling as much as -40%. Despite breaking below the 20 day moving average on 3 September  the immediate bullish rejection off the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on 4 September suggests the long-term uptrend remains intact. Moreover  price also formed a bullish price action  Piercing Pattern at the same time showed some early sign of strength.More importantly  the recent retest of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and 1.19 support area on 11 September was met with a similar bullish reaction. As a result  price formed another bullish price action  Hammer rejection off the support area signals a high likelihood of a rebound higher.Hence  expect price to bounce higher to test the 1.60 resistance area. The current low at 1.17 could be the next Higher Low (HL) point for the uptrend.,btohqsg
I think the highest is TUN  if I am not wrong Ling liong Sik is conferred entitled Tun,btohqsg

For Nov 2020  Top Glove‚Äôs nitrile glove ASP would be 4.1x that of Feb 2020‚Äôs level and we understand that there is still another 30-50% upside. Additionally  the ASP hike for latex powder free gloves has reaccelerated for Nov 2020 and there is still room to raise the ASP further. We raise FY20/21/22E EPS by 6%/63%/224% on higher ASPs  but retain our TP at MYR9.53 (ex-bonus) on a lower CY21E P/E target of 9x  about -1SD of 5Y mean (vs. 16x)  on consideration for earnings to taper post CY21E. BUY.,btohqsg

GKE everyday they do their sharebuybacks...they dont want their price to drop...well supported 78 79...just matter of time before they breakout 80...this time price action is very beautiful,btohqsg
I noticed last week Market Drop  GKE drop 77 then recovered back 79 very quickly...something must be brewing in it...,btohqsg
many prices look attractive  many also not at the bottom yet...,btohqsg

GKE got 1 chinese buyers 2017 want takeover $0.20 want...then the deal fall out...now so cheap...if BBs come in a big move  easily this month RALLIED to 10cents-12cents,btohqsg
Just a confirmation that market is still good for ppe and glove assuming results are excellent,btohqsg
Yeah but remember what happened to UG when results out?,btohqsg
Thinking too far? Now 0.080 also cant clear,btohqsg
Good price for all board...no good meh?,btohqsg
& dont compare with 2017 ah üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Sold at 2.83 and added GKE show some support at 79,btohqsg
We need know their history in order to anticpate what gonna happen in the near-term,btohqsg
Mt tw limit dn since 10 am,btohqsg
you already said deal fall out hahahaha no point saying this to anticipate,btohqsg
Year 2017 really is superb year... So many stocks huat until father  mother also don't know.,btohqsg
Why suddenly Taiwan side so bad only after scolding sg 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
I think that period was a big sell off in all medicals due to a few bad news and over valuation fears.,btohqsg
Just wait GKE 1 mouth break 80 later...shortists not easily...buyers for GKE very united,btohqsg
DOW FUTURES + 300 le....OMG...what a bullish night it be later,btohqsg
Up bcos of vaccine hope.. no good for med stks,btohqsg
Any good stocks BRO & SIS buying today? I am very hungry...if nthin i may buy ALL in GKE,btohqsg
You every day must buy ah? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
pls do i want see it above 80,btohqsg
Gke no strength.. Dun buy liao,btohqsg
Everyday BUY GKE....next Year ANNUAL report dont know can make it to TOP 20 shareholders not,btohqsg
Min TOP 20 shareholder need 7m shares,btohqsg
Wow I did not know you buy to aim for such ego. Haha,btohqsg
I mean i hope i dont stuck by next Year end,btohqsg
Dont know what to buy also....GKE suits me....so i ok with it,btohqsg
Not too big la...some BRO & SIS here got 200lot MEDTECS...GKE so far i got 1.5m shares,btohqsg

You never know 1 day GKE become $0.20 $0.30?...must plan for RETIREMENT funds also,btohqsg
Base on wat to b 20,btohqsg
But can become 1 c also,btohqsg
I see. But by your logic many stocks also we don‚Äôt know will reach what high price what,btohqsg
But you are the micro Penny specialist lah üòÜ,btohqsg
No ones will know but if the coy got prospects...I think can GROW...which penny keep on sharebuybacks 500lot everyday,btohqsg
Everyday GKE spend 40k to sharebuybacks..1 week already 200k le,btohqsg
When company do sharebuybacks  it is a sign of their business confidence as they want to reduce their number of issued shares.,btohqsg
I wish you all the best,btohqsg
So at end of day  Coy ROE% will be high when there less number of issued shares,btohqsg
Today market so dead. Sleepy üò¥,btohqsg
Should pay off if you can hold. Good chance I reckon.,btohqsg
Everyday GKE EPS and ROI will go up by a small margin...due to sharebuybacks,btohqsg
This show GKE is very concerned for their shareholders due to they supporting their shareprices,btohqsg
At end day  they want their both stakeholder shareholder happy,btohqsg
Whoever decides to buy GKE  best is have the holding power. BBs very patient.Hard to time their move this one ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
Cloudy outlook...1 word uncertainty..not too sure how temasek going integrate it,btohqsg
Ample still dreaming on a cold weather.. Hahha,btohqsg

Thanks for taking this video  im more confidence in the coming quarters,btohqsg
MT Taiwan break support @50.. (closed @47 TWD  2.19SGD).. sigh...,btohqsg
Took a drive last Friday to see their activity at their logistics hub. They are definitely much busier than when I visited 1.5 years back.I Guess rise in e-commerce have helped their business a lot   which explains the turnaround in their latest Financial year making almost 5 million from more than 100 million turnover as compared to the past 3 years losses.Really positive for me. Good luck to all GKE holders,btohqsg
Very nice uptrend with ascending triangle. Could be big move coming. Also based on the volume spikes  can see the volume ascending too on each buy spike up. Chart looking solid,btohqsg
Hahhaha  was in the area so went to survey üòé,btohqsg
But if MT Taiwan keep dropping  hard for MT Singapore to go up  even though there is a price disparity ($1.28 in Singapore vs  $2.19 in Taiwan)...,btohqsg
Great i bought ix already. Waiting for the day it rise.,btohqsg
They dun buy everyweek. Mayb once a week,btohqsg
