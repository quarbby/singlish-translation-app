Was going to ask Pete to faster patent his idea,btohqsg

Maybe that way I can be rich,btohqsg
You mean you don't already have one?,btohqsg

Lol a simple case of poor estimation and wrong timing.. but I agree that not only bikers but drivers also  wonder how they pass.,btohqsg
But seriously got 2 major issues here,btohqsg
Why the hell is the Van on 2nd lane?,btohqsg
Not in mass production but Kia Stinger Convertible 4 door looks more nicer,btohqsg
that's probably the only part of me that's worth anything. Coz hardly used.  Low Mileage.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs something about cars without B Pillars ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
Not in mass production because it doesn't meet safety criteria,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs 1 small pillar protruding out from the base,btohqsg
4 seater verts need roll bars behind the seats,btohqsg
If they put reinforcement between the front and rear seat and alsoConvert the Center console + rear console into some reinforced material then maybe could work leh,btohqsg
Why no  all for the sake of a bigger sitting convertible,btohqsg
You go ahead then since since safety is not a word in your dictionary,btohqsg
I see you are taking inspiration from the wise James May,btohqsg
F1 coming soon can just snatch and go  who can outrun you,btohqsg
I never really like the looks for RR leh  just like Mercedes  abit roundish,btohqsg
I prefer the aggressive type of look,btohqsg
But then again I can‚Äôt afford it  so no need to think so much,btohqsg
Not if you get the hard top,btohqsg
Then take the whole top off,btohqsg
Looks like truck with a small flatbed  and a panoramic roof,btohqsg

It‚Äôs a crossover. Sub compact at that too,btohqsg
So not an SUV technically. More MPV,btohqsg
Maybe you don‚Äôt know much about cars,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs not vezel then what car is that,btohqsg

But at least is tray system  deadskin all this won‚Äôt so easily go underneath,btohqsg
Anyway is extra $70 compared to Trapo,btohqsg
I install Trapo on my car  doesn‚Äôt fully cover  the transmission tunnel there also cmi  they have the plug thing to plug onto the door but my car doesn‚Äôt even have it  a lot of stupid issue in general la,btohqsg
I am eyeing their top of the range with lifetime warranty rather than the classic series with 1 year,btohqsg
I think you better go look at showroom or find me see it first before you buy bah  I considering buying Maxpider already when I saw the ad just now.,btohqsg
I used it on my 116d and now on my mx5  it's good,btohqsg
Also it slides around a lot,btohqsg
Hanor‚Ä¶ Reminds me of my view every morning!,btohqsg
What if the ride is only for 30m ? One step I already hit JB liao,btohqsg

They give Velcro on my transmission tunnel only  the rest don‚Äôt have. They have clip and assume my car have my car don‚Äôt have lmaoo,btohqsg
Is it time for lunch soon?,btohqsg
But hearday maggie curry nice for supper,btohqsg
My wife face also look like Maggie mee,btohqsg
It‚Äôs really good  easy to clean too  there‚Äôs another better quality  but need preorder and more expensive,btohqsg
One thing good about trapo also damn easy to clean,btohqsg
There's holders on the front ones,btohqsg
But must put straight onto carpet  not like.most people on top of the stock manufacturer mats,btohqsg
I also use this - J,btohqsg
I've tried trapo but it feels like anything but premium,btohqsg
Take pic to show you in JB,btohqsg
Got remove but don‚Äôt have the pop socket,btohqsg
Weird  most VAG have at least one socket for the front,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also using the Royal series  really good. Love the tray design so everything is on the mat itself,btohqsg
Easy to dust  vacuum and wash. Maggie mee was the worst thing  the amount of gunk stuck in between was horrendous,btohqsg
Material for the Royal series feels very similar to the stock mats too  doesn‚Äôt feel cheap and has a nice soft touch,btohqsg
The hokkien comments in the background lol,btohqsg
Next time go for premium liao,btohqsg
My car also not atas enough so they only have the Royal series available hahaha,btohqsg
inspection is suppose to check engine serial number and chassis serial number lol,btohqsg
I will get trapo since got the colour combo I want  and I can send directly to my workshop in MY lol,btohqsg
(and 30% cheaper buy in RM than in SGD üôà),btohqsg
Next time conti car alr üòÇ,btohqsg
Maxpider also have brown I think,btohqsg
All cars in Singapore are premium cars.Malaysian be like: 330K RM for a piece of darn paper for Perodua Bezza ü§£,btohqsg

No toll on road some more,btohqsg

Take bus then tow the car in,btohqsg
Go out maybe ok but coming back will have to monitor sir,btohqsg
Not coming back that soon. Going there to do up car. One week later then come back SG.,btohqsg
You will stay there to monitor?,btohqsg
Make sure you have someone trustworthy there to help you monitor sir,btohqsg
Not saying anything but really just in case only,btohqsg
I have a lot of eyes in JB  thanks for the heads up sir!,btohqsg
i wanna do bodykit & air intake too but not sure to go jb do or do in sg,btohqsg
rule of thumb: labour cost is def cheaper in JB,btohqsg
Classic car parts if go missing .. even if have money also hard to replace,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the reason they sometimes go missing,btohqsg
previous car i did in jb but the workmanship abit lapsupüòÖbut i didnt complain coz it was alot cheaper,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt consider doing up body kit in JB,btohqsg
I heard too many horror stories,btohqsg
Really ah  when not peak  the bus are darn efficient and comfortable.,btohqsg
pls sharei love horror stories and movies ü§£ü§™,btohqsg
cases are cars go in but didn't come back one piece?,btohqsg

Thats why I am actually glad that my friend's JB condo security is super on the ball.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have the patience to watch them for hours,btohqsg
i watched from sun up till sun down ü´†almost passaway,btohqsg
Anything wrong also easy to rectify if done in SG,btohqsg

Our bros here all rich kor kors,btohqsg

this happened at my friend condo...Kenna cos he is supposed to park at lot 789 üòÇI appreciate the security so on the ball üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i very poorthats why i went msia zheng,btohqsg
i think the condo anti sg car issitor trying to earn unclamp fee,btohqsg
if poor better dont zhng. Once body kit hits kerb  it is waste of money,btohqsg
nah  Honda never follow instructions. Condo have right to clamp. Nothing happened to my car.,btohqsg
true alsocivic kinda low üò∞last week i go reservistmy car undercarriage kena 1 huge hump,btohqsg

"aiyo I totally regretted searching ""Car Mat"" on facebook.... now I am slapped with all the ads and sponsored post about car mat.",btohqsg
Coe is bid by the dealer ?,btohqsg
No we put deposit then dealer wait for us to get our coes,btohqsg
Is it ? I not sure how they bid,btohqsg
Very rare in sg the person ownself bid then go buy car,btohqsg
Cus dealers also earn from ur coe,btohqsg
Within the car price eg car 120k coe maybe they budget inside 40k for coe,btohqsg
But maybe when bid bid 30k,btohqsg
They lucky they get then earn 10k liao,btohqsg
So the increase also cost by the bidder,btohqsg
Uk how coe is calcated also right the price?,btohqsg
Eg 100th person bid amt from 50k to 100k,btohqsg
Im pretty sure today coe 103k confirm got someone go throw in bid 120k de,btohqsg
U wait ah i ltr explain i driving,btohqsg
Or some other expert ltr reply u,btohqsg
They will take the 101th bid and plus One dollar,btohqsg
Then 1 to 100th bids is ranging from 75k to 150k,btohqsg
But they all only pay 50k COE,btohqsg
I think no need understand also can,btohqsg
I dare say 90% of us don‚Äôt buy brand new car fresh from the oven,btohqsg
Actually idk lah  all here rich kor kors,btohqsg
I think impt to know ah,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry. Can send vm. Now very popular to do,btohqsg

That'll be evo9s and type Rs right,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt say. Toyota picnic also leh!,btohqsg
I prefer to buy new car,btohqsg
Change every 3- 4 yrs before the warranty ends,btohqsg
No need to worry about warranty,btohqsg
Interesting question: how often does one generally claim on new car warranties? I would imagine failure rates won‚Äôt be too high (granted of course there are outliers or the occasional failure event),btohqsg
My first day of driving Honda Vezel 2021 model a year ago  I already claim warranty,btohqsg
First day drive my Honda Vezel to work  end up want go home  car totally dead.Hand brake cannot turn off  media player on off on off  cannot turn on engine etc,btohqsg
actually this is why i worry all these fancy fancy gadgets,btohqsg
I need  please support my modding,btohqsg
This the Honda tho  not much fancy thing except the electronic brake.But apparently the battery died??? That‚Äôs what they say but I‚Äôve tried asking my colleague to jump start etc to no avail,btohqsg
And the whole car was glitching out with the electronics  where can dead battery do that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
not some fancy button for me to flip,btohqsg
Eew foot brake haha  last time I remember I forgot to engage the brake and just stepped out of the car  my car rolled and luckily I noticed and jump in to stop,btohqsg
wa this one is ur fault sioa,btohqsg
i dont drive the tonners but i always walk in between them,btohqsg
Too used to electronic brake mah  when you open door on most modern car  even if you‚Äôre in gear  they will auto engageAt that point in time I rented my friend car for a day also  so blur blur one,btohqsg
this is why u rich i poor,btohqsg
cus i dont drive modern cars,btohqsg
2016 still considered somewhat new ah,btohqsg
iirc they have virtual cockpit as well but not as nice as Audi one,btohqsg
You drive a coe car sir,btohqsg
i drive a non-problematic but uncle car,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I hated when cars go over reliant on electronics even for simple things. Really what‚Äôs wrong with the old school hand brake? It never goes wrong  until recently geniuses pull handbrakes but never pull up fully and assumed handbrake were pulled ü§¶,btohqsg
Actually yeah dead battery causes a lot of glitches in cars,btohqsg
in some cars will have christmas tree on dashboard,btohqsg
change the batt and all fine,btohqsg

Somehow a lot of people supporting Lexus steer by wire tho,btohqsg
But but technology so advance now  you don‚Äôt have to touch. ‚ÄúHey Audi  set driver side aircon to 18 degree‚Äù,btohqsg
Electronic steering  send signal to steer one,btohqsg
I just wanna fiddle the aircon by myself :(,btohqsg

That‚Äôs why you have your wife beside you in driver seat,btohqsg

We both touchy touchy each others knob,btohqsg
Can ask your favouriteFzsit beside you,btohqsg
Touch each other knob  up down 360  any direction you desire,btohqsg
Can use it as a shifter as well  if your car automatic  no problem. If your passenger wanna try shifting gear  no problem,btohqsg

One rim $6 now. Use to be $5. Either that they cut the paper from 500 to 440 ü•≤That‚Äôs the A4 I can afford ü•≤,btohqsg
Just try to keep car installments 10% of your salary. In short just live within your means ü•πü•π,btohqsg
Means I can only afford Tamiya üò®,btohqsg
can anyone tell me this HU model can connect wireless for android auto?https://www.alpine-asia.com/index.php/en/productDetail/127/iLX-507E,btohqsg
with the latest CAT A COE price  just the COE alone the depre alone is $835 per month.10% of your salary for CAT A COE meant you should be earning $8350 monthly.Oh if you count take home pay  remember to deduct your 20% contribution to CPF  that meant you gross salary jolly well be 10.5K.,btohqsg
yea  I cannot afford black or yellow plate cars.,btohqsg
Your figure is correct as calculated by this article  but that was when coe was still 60k.,btohqsg
yup  cos I am only refering to COE  havent add the acutal car cost mah,btohqsg
Stupid COE depre. I dont think I will buy any black plate or yellow plate car.Donating $833 a month for the entitlement  no thank you.,btohqsg
Aiya actually i see other country the car cost also went up,btohqsg
Its just singapore got alot go up,btohqsg
Thats why our car shoot up like mad,btohqsg
Yes. No other way to put this but factually.,btohqsg
Your cashing out move was probably a good and sensible one. üëçüèº,btohqsg
Tesla since the start of the year has slashed price numerous times now 20% discount,btohqsg
We've entered an EV price war. Everyone vying for market share.,btohqsg
Not only that  PHV bids for COE  unlike Taxi.,btohqsg
Ya coe does not matter to them they only need to pass the cost down to consumers. Higher the coe  higher the rent volume and higher the rent ü•π,btohqsg
So long they earn a margin they can go home happy ü•π,btohqsg
PRECISELY. Like sales of 2nd car  if anyone raise price  any monkey will follow suit.,btohqsg
OK LA I WILL SELL MY CABRIO WHO WANTS LOL,btohqsg
jacked up the price after coe went up,btohqsg
bro i can play with ur boss,btohqsg

im cashing out and going for a shorter term car  lower repayment,btohqsg
@sgcmcommunityWhy is a Hiace inside Vintage car search??,btohqsg
and yea some people will opt for car sharing.Then end of the day we still have to remember that cars from car sharing also contributed to the raise of COE price.,btohqsg
