hi guys! does anyone know if paying using uob evol via apple pay through xnap is considered an online transaction or mobile contactless?,btohqsg
To anyone who might find this useful  I just had a live chat session with UOB about the ONE card. Apparently  for new sign ups  the first quarterly cash back can be prorated to $66 cash back if you PURPOSELY don‚Äôt hit the minimum spend for the first month  and then spend $1000 on the remaining 2 months of the first quarter. But if you hit $500 in the first month  and you spend $1000 in the remaining 2 months  you will only get $50 cash back. Just something to look out for.I was also able to align my statement month with the calendar month through the live chat. I applied for the card on 07/10 and according to the CSO my statement date is actually 12/10. So I requested it to be changed to the first of the month to the last day of the month  just to make tracking easier.I hope this helps someone  cos getting this information was a JOURNEY.,btohqsg

This has positive cashback compared to the rest,btohqsg
so meaning after all the fees and everything   will still get positive cashback ?,btohqsg

Hi  im an EP holder in Singapore. Just arrived. Looking for a bank that provide a personal loan  a credit card that has good air miles and a normal current account..  im thinking citibank? or standard chartered,btohqsg

Can I convert my existing dbs account in to multiplier account?What is the max interest amount one can get on multiplier account? Can someone explain with example.I will use this account for salary and credit card bill payment.,btohqsg
No. You can open a new multiplier account  suggest you look at the table provided by DBS and pick your questions based on your own scenario.Alternatively  you might want to take a look at UOB One account for better rates.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs because OCBC uses FAST to pay bills but hsbc(Maybank & CIMB) doesn‚Äôt accept fast payments to their cards.,btohqsg
I think its possible... perhaps u can call them to request.,btohqsg
Anyone know which DBs credit card no annual fee??,btohqsg
Dont have. U might wanna try stanchart smart cc,btohqsg
why this question anyway? So far no issue waiving annual fees for those $30k/$80k income DBS cc,btohqsg

Hi can i check  if i have the UOB one acc and card. if i have a sup card. if the main and sup card spend $250 each to hit the minimum. Are we eligible for the cash back?,btohqsg
Usually the sup card spending is considered part of the main cardholder's spend. so in your case  it should be thus counted as a total of $500 spend on the main card.,btohqsg
