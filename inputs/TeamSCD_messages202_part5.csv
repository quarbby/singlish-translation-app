Just a question  when y‚Äôall emergency brake or just brake in general do you guys brake first then clutch or clutch first then brake,btohqsg
Even its not weekend  custom still jam like crazy at this time. The power of 1SGD to 3.4RM,btohqsg
Brake first... Or sometimes both same time,btohqsg
Generally brake depends on speed ü§î,btohqsg
i just saw a 180sx Ferrari and bmw,btohqsg
Kidding la but I smtimes not sure,btohqsg
As long got step brake can already,btohqsg
Ya emergency situation your engine stall also can help you stop,btohqsg
Last time I press brake too hard my car will stall ‚Äúmid driving‚Äù,btohqsg
I think this one my car problem,btohqsg
nice nice take all 3 lane crusir side by side,btohqsg
When I brake hard my car will turn off,btohqsg
Car or driver issue idk ah,btohqsg
But all the car I drive all got problem one (maybe is I make one),btohqsg
Ah then maybe that's your leg liao,btohqsg
I‚Äôve realised newer cars come with this accel lag,btohqsg
When I went back to Jp in march I drove a quite new Mazda 3,btohqsg
When I try to accelerate the car will always lag 3 seconds,btohqsg
Dk whether it‚Äôs Indiv car problem or safety thing,btohqsg
Tuning would help ba  but not worth to do just for that,btohqsg
Maybe step earlier lor  the power is delayed anyway,btohqsg
Mghs got the worst lag ever,btohqsg
Even the simi triple sports mode no use,btohqsg
To be fair it is q a big car,btohqsg
I have to say  even though there is lack of power for Mazda 3  the handling all that super Zai,btohqsg
