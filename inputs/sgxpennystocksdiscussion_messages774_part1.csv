WTI crude futures were down almost 3% to $65 a barrel on Monday  holding at levels not seen since late 2021  and extending a 13% slump last week  as concerns mount that the banking turmoil could hurt the economies and cause a recession  lowering fuel demand. Yet  initial enthusiasm over the government-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS and coordinated action by major central banks to boost dollar liquidity faded  leading to a more cautious mood.,btohqsg
Close short time to long lol,btohqsg
That's right  better to offend thousands of retailers than to offend the top 30 power fund house,btohqsg
