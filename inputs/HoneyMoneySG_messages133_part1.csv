Can consider getting the UOB set of cards if you are interested in the miles game. Else  maybe just 1 Citi PremierMiles?,btohqsg
for gxs 3.48% boost pocket is capped at 30k i think  at least for me,btohqsg

hello everyone  quick question here. if I buy something from best or gain city and want pay by installment is there any credit card I can use to get points?,btohqsg

Can‚Äôt say this. U always have a choice.Honestly to expect 3.xx% pa and above for close to risk free. Is not sustainable in long run.,btohqsg
Just gonna put it out here first that more risk averse people may be considering CPF SA/MA at 4.14% p.a.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cpf-special-medisave-retirement-accounts-interest-rate-rise-q4-4620036,btohqsg

Wow  the more you know. I searched back history and saw it was mentioned is 4112  so I thought it was excluded,btohqsg

sorry to ask this noob question.. for UOB VS  u will not get 4mpd if the spent is not on uob$ merchant right?I made a transaction of $2k one shot using UOB VS on a non uob $ merchant and I am getting the base miles which is equivalent to 400 UOB$.I made another transaction of $200 on the same merchant using UOB PPV it give me 4mpd.. so i m confuse..both transaction made using paywave,btohqsg
Each card credits miles differently. Ppv credit 4mpd when posted. VS credit 0.4mpd when posted and 3.6mpd in the next statement month.,btohqsg

Sorry I am asking on behalf of a friend. He is taking part in the posb promo where he had to spend 500 a month for 3 consecutive months to get back $200. However he is uncertain if there were any exclusions. Could any gurus help to advise please?,btohqsg
As Trazora mentioned  read the T&C. I was keen but when I saw Amaze and CardUp transactions were excluded  I gave up.,btohqsg
Just do normal unambiguous spend Loh,btohqsg
Would love to but I‚Äôm meeting a few cards min spend now so silly for me to switch suddenly and change my cadence.If they allowed CardUp  I will be happy to try.,btohqsg
At the very worst  can always go ntuc topup gift card Loh. If the spend bonus is attractive.,btohqsg
