If he wants go poly  go sec 5 only way.If he ends up going ite  he may not touch maths/science for 2 yrs as he learns his technical skills.He may end up going poly through ite. The prob is he may not be able to keep up with the subjects taught in said poly course.Like my friend higher nitec aerospace eng  4.0 gpa to nyp aerospace as well.He did not touch maths for 2 years  he go through first sem. Can't understand anything.,btohqsg

idk how hackers manage to know dr card and cr card details without having the physical card,btohqsg
i think most of us are also scared to lose money due to high risk investments. the thing abt investments is either u earn more money or lose some. most of us choose reliable sources of investments which are banks but the interest rate arenâ€™t high. also for uob  you need to spent at least $500 on average for debit / credit card and many students canâ€™t afford that on a daily basis,btohqsg
lol gen Zs are financially illiterate,btohqsg
true and many donâ€™t bother trying to understand more,btohqsg
thanks all for helping prop up the economy,btohqsg
u don't need to be employed to be financially literate?,btohqsg
huh i thought the article referred to gen z aged 18 and above,btohqsg
Gen Zs in Singapore do not have enough rainy day savings  life insurance coverage or investments  according to a bank poll.,btohqsg
ya cause y'all all spend it on dumb shit and not save it,btohqsg
gen z delude themselves into having literacy when we ( other gen z including me ) don't,btohqsg
I thought they are not working,btohqsg
if gen z ppl open bank/savings  obviously they have some source of funds,btohqsg
and anw... having some basic investments or at least understanding is useful mah...,btohqsg
the article mentioned gen z ppl do invest among the other age groups surveyed iirc,btohqsg
or at least how to get the most out of the bank accounts or cards that u can get,btohqsg
ya this one is the problem with gen z,btohqsg
