cavaet is that i switched since Jul 2023  so im not sure how far simba has improved,btohqsg
my simba speed test consistently 20-30mbps only..lol,btohqsg
is ZYM esim? don't recall them having esim option,btohqsg
yes i just downloaded the app and itâ€™s mentioned there,btohqsg
depends from person to person   20-30mbps is fine for my use case  i just watch videos and browse internet  which load quick enough ( dont really see any buffer time compared to m1 when underground)   better signal than m1 sometimes even,btohqsg
my 1st year of simba... underground coverage was 0..haha,btohqsg
Anyone know what kind of transaction is this?,btohqsg
topping up shopee pay? or withdrawing from shopee pay?,btohqsg
Ohh then could be withdrawal. Thanks. It took so long I forgot about it,btohqsg
i used it when it was tpg in 2020 it was bad underground  but last year april - august 2023 was okay with me when going underground and even in between some areas like botanic gardens  where even M1 doesn't have receptions but my simba will be able to load,btohqsg
oh dear..M1 that bad? was thinking port my other starhub over....hear shitty reviews of starhub new star plans...haiz,btohqsg
Yup itâ€™s withdrawal from my shopee pay. I just checked the amt against my shopee app,btohqsg
cool..i gonna withdraw my shopee pay amount too,btohqsg
M1 has always been bad. Youâ€™re better off with StarHub or SingTel network,btohqsg
think i stay starhub 4G then...,btohqsg
nah m1 is bad . i wouldn't choose m1 even though i am still using it,btohqsg
broadband wise for all telco is the same   because they are connecting via the same cable underground,btohqsg
Yeaa broadband not much impact but mobile network depends on the cell towers,btohqsg
mine home M1 fiber for 8 years...so far so good,btohqsg
Now become paypal plus amex tcb liao,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies. I tried last night to transfer ocbc $ points at stack webpage of ocbc to marriot bonvy points..But can't find it to transfer. Pls advise.,btohqsg
oh nuts.. thanks... i totally forgot UOB Absolute started their nonsense exclusions already.. Will amend my post,btohqsg
I tried at ocbc stack page... only can transfer to kris flyer SQ and also cash. Can't transfer to marriot bonvy,btohqsg
I say ocbc reward redemption website not stack  explore that,btohqsg
I've looked at the app  not sure how this is done. Could u pls share more info?,btohqsg
one motoring website.. when u pay.. can choose paypaljust pay as GUEST.. then key in your amex truecashback,btohqsg
Any suggestion for upcoming 6 Months T bills cutoff yield for competitive bid? Thanks,btohqsg
hmm.. firstly cash i won't do Tbills since banks savings rate are high..so if you really want to do tbills you should put a comp bid something high like 3.58% (but risk not getting any allocation),btohqsg
I see. Appreciate it. Does PayPal work with any other bills like IRAS?,btohqsg
Iras doesn't accept paypal from what i know,btohqsg
Can anyone have experience if ufit is 7997 and good to use HSBC Revolution? here is the result from heymax,btohqsg
it depends on your opportunity cost right,btohqsg
if you don't get the T bills what interest will the money earns?,btohqsg
so for example if you don't get the tbills you will put the cash into an instrument that earns 2.0%  then anything higher than 2% will be better.,btohqsg
which is why CPF tbills i always put comp below 3%.. but people scold me low ball.. LOL,btohqsg
haha I am the selfish one I only care about myself. if it brings down the yeild so be it.,btohqsg
i seriously doubt our CPF Tbill amount will move the dial..it is the FIs that really move the dial,btohqsg
else if you put 3.5% and the outcome is 3.5% you might not get full allocation.,btohqsg
Guys. I just found the answer through AI Facebook. Since Google can't find. Don't mind share with you guys and ladies. In case you want to transfer ocbc points to hotel programmes.,btohqsg
No. Is different. This one is go into ocbc online banking.,btohqsg
If you think it's fraudulent then report,btohqsg
U read what i wrote  go ocbc website which is the online banking reward,btohqsg
He cannot read. Don't waste your breath (thumb),btohqsg
Imo  it depends on whatâ€™s the acceptable rate you are ok to get  and are you willing to not get full allocation. Last few records are around 3.6-3.7  but this kind of rates easily can get outside unless you have alrd max out everything. However on a low amount of investment  3.7 is still considered high,btohqsg
One is not said by meta AI ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Hahaha so he rather trust a robot. I guess this is the world we live in right now,btohqsg
Alright . I will try later..  thanks,btohqsg
Bros .. I would like to ask you guys .. if I cancel uob preferred visa.. the ophan points .. what you going to do about it since not all the points can be transfer to SQ kris flyer,btohqsg
Spend more to hit next block  or give up on them,btohqsg
Because last week I also realise now uob points is unable to transfer to kris pay apps anymore,btohqsg
