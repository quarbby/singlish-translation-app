Hi  anybody know for higher foreign transactions spend (USD2 000 to USD5 000)Is an amaze + general spend card (Citi Prestige etc.) or Trust card/Youtrip will have more cost savings?,btohqsg
How much do u value ur mile?,btohqsg
I think about 1.10 to 1.90c/mile  😅,btohqsg
Take 1000 sgd amount as example.With amaze (2% fee) hence 1020 total. 20$ fee for 1316 miles (valued at 14.5$ at 1.1cpm)Without amaze (bank 3.25% fee) hence 1032.5 total. 32.5$ fee for 2065 miles (valued at 22.75$ at 1.1cpm)Youtrip/trust is better in this case.,btohqsg
Ofc I ignore the amount will contribute to Citi prestige limo rides. You can plug 1.9cpm and redo the calc,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony  really really appreciate the response !,btohqsg
use citi rewards directly on health buddy app,btohqsg
If you are very sure about the spending  you can try to research iChange. They do offer you the option to exchange SGD to USD in advance (similar to Youtrip). The exchange rate can be better than Interbank rate,btohqsg

Yes I also thought so (forever calculating  never tracked)Anyone able to get ShopBack to track Klook purchases where u used partial or full gift card to settle payment?,btohqsg
Chris. Does your ShopBack or heymax track purchases made with gift card?!And of course even if tracked  eventually get paid?,btohqsg
First time buying and using klook gift card  pending,btohqsg
Ah. I already used gift cards twice and ShopBack never successfully tracked my Klook purchases paid partially or fully with gift cards.But purchase of gift cards itself yes it gets tracked and paid out.,btohqsg
Is it possible to let my wife use physical credit card and I use the same credit card in Google pay to take mrt?,btohqsg
Possible as most pple don't check signature or don't even need to sign. But if yr card has a Christian name & if merchant is alert  then may be a problem.,btohqsg
Depends on which card….. some card dont earns bonus points when using the physical card,btohqsg
Not care about points. Just make sure we can take mrt together using the same card 1 with physical 1 with mobile,btohqsg
I did empty my youtrip by topping up to the nearest tens. Then used it to top up my kid's concession.,btohqsg

"You can try. But you might be charged with 4 different trips as the system will be ""confused"".",btohqsg
Is the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant American Express Card available in SG to upgrade to Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite status?,btohqsg
No harm to try. If they charge you $8 just try to claim on SimplyGo with the reason tap with different card/device. If the app got issue just call into Translink. Then probably don't try again because you'll have to do this every time.,btohqsg
Ya planning to try hahaha. Hopefully they did cater for such scenario,btohqsg
Worst thing that can happen is they reject your claim and you get charged $8 lor. Not a lot.,btohqsg
At least the $8 still got points to earn 😂,btohqsg
Yes will clock $8 spending and the rewards.,btohqsg
