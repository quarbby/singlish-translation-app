Without being a commander  your rank at the end of NS could be between PFC (Private first class) to CFC (Corporal first class),btohqsg
Yeah I think I‚Äôm a private,btohqsg
Wtf pfc they never give that out,btohqsg
wgt get 950 at sgt  join SCDF get 900+ within your second month,btohqsg
my basic firefighting training pay is 900+,btohqsg
If i sit too long I could get deep vein thrombosis,btohqsg
ok bye back to doing my own stuff,btohqsg
Close enough la but you know who is saf commander in chief,btohqsg
We don't have any rank higher than 3 star,btohqsg
do people who serve SCDF in their NS  actually go on firefighting missions?,btohqsg
actually the logic is...this is similar to real life,btohqsg
Just like how nsfs who go to Air Force don‚Äôt actually fly plane,btohqsg
but I'm genuinely impressed  and I can see why SCDF are paid more,btohqsg
Funny thing is  when you Major and above  you rarely touch your gun.,btohqsg
More likely to get injured by paper cut,btohqsg
Neil say I most.likely going SPF sia,btohqsg
Neil is totally unbiased about SPF,btohqsg
He said I am the only child,btohqsg
Than only son sure go spfü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
That sounds like Attack on Titan: The best and most qualified soldiers go to the most innermost part of the city and away from the active fighting,btohqsg
"Similarly  the most ""experienced"" aka the high rankers are doing all the admin stuff",btohqsg
You aren't promoted to Major cause of your fighting skills,btohqsg
Well  my friend is only son but still go to army,btohqsg
Actually more because at higher ranks  you plan bigger scale operations  and you're needed on the ground much less.,btohqsg
The experienced at field ones are specialists,btohqsg
They get promoted up til warrant officers,btohqsg
So you aren't the only son,btohqsg
Does PES affect SAF SPF or SCDF?,btohqsg
Which still do occasionally go on the field,btohqsg
Officers go just to get experience only,btohqsg

Don't ruin my Descendants of the Sun fantasy :(,btohqsg
Captain will still go on field and fight quite often,btohqsg
How to apply for president scholar,btohqsg

One of the recent president scholars was from ACJC,btohqsg
I never join counsell before sia,btohqsg
then you must make all your friends nominate u for all those awards,btohqsg
Lol unless you from hci/ri you have very little chance anyway,btohqsg
"maybe can go for those ""intellectual"" seminars/conferences where ministers come and talk  and ask ""smart"" questions",btohqsg
Guess whose the first president scholar,btohqsg
