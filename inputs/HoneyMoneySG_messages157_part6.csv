i remember HODLNAUT CEO also said this before,btohqsg
Hodlnaut was a Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading platform which collapsed when the TerraUSD (also known as UST) lost its peg to the US Dollar. The loss of the peg resulted in Hodlnaut's holdings dropping by almost 70% overnight  and the collapse of the platform.Its not even the same thing ü§°,btohqsg
