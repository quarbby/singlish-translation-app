B2B is a whole different ball game,btohqsg
B2B is businesses gouging money from other businesses,btohqsg
But yeah they will undervalue the first project,btohqsg
Cos they wanna get expertise in the energy sector or wtv,btohqsg
Then slowly increase price for other energy companies,btohqsg
Hmm oh well they pay me decently,btohqsg
is the product you're providing worth the amount they're paying,btohqsg
trhen ofc jack price up lor,btohqsg
Their tier 2 tho I tot they vv established alr,btohqsg
Then they dun have to do,btohqsg
And charge high price from the start,btohqsg
Heard one of the head of an infamous fa company used to do tuition at his house,btohqsg
tuition is inherently the same  but personally i think while it's similar  tuition is more parasitical purely cause of how tuition n chionging education is so ingrained and ppl prey on that and rip parents off,btohqsg
Isn't it more for parents to flex,btohqsg
I see my relatives flex my cousin go learning lab etc,btohqsg
parents who flex enable the shitty practices of the industry and increase the barrier of entry for less well off parents who just genuinely want their kids to have a better chance at life,btohqsg
im adding the tuition industry to the list of reasons why i don't want kids LOL,btohqsg
Meanwhile I didn't have tuition and just consult teachers.onky got 88.75 then the relatives keep telling my parents why nvr send me learning lab cfm will get 90rp  and h3 distinction then and won't get rejected by nus and smu law,btohqsg
fuck the singapore mindset of chionging ngl,btohqsg
and all the education ministers preach so much bs about less focus on academics,btohqsg
when that just fuels the tuition industry,btohqsg
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/business/news-events/news/story-detail/lessons-from-the-business-of-tuition-are-we-paying-attentionless focus on academics my sweet fat ass,btohqsg
Learning lab and zenith most elite ones?,btohqsg
hokkien mee and char kway teow for breakfast ig lol,btohqsg
i woke up at 10 yes,btohqsg
also my marketing prof is in this article lmao,btohqsg
i think that guy goes to zenith,btohqsg
Yeah I heard relatives say jc more ex in fees vs poly,btohqsg
LOL if singapore's education system sucks china education system is a nightmare in a nightmare,btohqsg
Got one relative spend like 80k on tuition for 3 years.son still fail alevels twice,btohqsg
feel like wld make it worse,btohqsg
I tried teaching him also but he don't getz,btohqsg
is it dw or legit cannot,btohqsg
Err like I tell him 5 times simplifying it,btohqsg
Ask him try himself like similar qns,btohqsg
The piecewise function also didn't get,btohqsg
My father told me some people are just born with less motivation to do well then others  this could be the case,btohqsg
Worse part is their fam not rich so had to borrow money to fund the tuition,btohqsg
And cos of that couldn't fund his brother sim degree,btohqsg
Then both have to work after poky to pay for sim,btohqsg
I also had a ex-friend that was like him  parents were prc and came to sg for a better life  son could not do well borrowed about 150k sgd from relatives back home to send him for courses to do better,btohqsg
In the end  he could not do well enough to go a local Uni  went back just a yr or two ago,btohqsg
I mean even during the tutor session he more interested in vaping/smoking/talking about picking up girls etc,btohqsg
Even in poly and ns also liddat,btohqsg
Yea I’ve met many people like him…because studies to him has no value. That’s why he does all this  least he did not show disrespect to the tutor or teacher,btohqsg
I’ve had friends that played phone games + volume as the teacher was teaching,btohqsg
He also says I got high rp cos I lucky and smart and he unlucky n dumb so he will nvr do well etc,btohqsg
Nvr mention the hours put in  etc,btohqsg
Yep as I suspected it’s the stuck mentality,btohqsg
As I always say  something traumatic must happen for him to get out of his stuck mentality  no amount of counselling  funding  sweet talking will ever get him out,btohqsg
