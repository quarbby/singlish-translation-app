"""If girl kena raped  meaning she ask for its cos her dressing is slutty"". - Superior race  CeCa mindset.",btohqsg
That one sounds like if guy rapes  he is asking to be castrated 😏😉 I recommend using mandolin to slice repeatedly until he is left with 1.25cm length.,btohqsg
Like when they raping  victim say no  they got stop? 🤨,btohqsg
So rapists: send into jail  let them experience it  rotan followed by mandolin treatment before he's released.,btohqsg

Don't need gay prison. Any prison that has hard core types  those hate rapists.  Rapists confirm kena target one.,btohqsg
Actually shld chemically castrate especially those pedophiles. But I dunno why sg don't have,btohqsg
Like their victims didn't have a right not to be abused / raped?,btohqsg
Just saying. There will always be ppl using this right to counter other's right. That's just how sick the world is.,btohqsg
Too peaceful.. That's why eat full nothing to do,btohqsg
That's why they need to be thankful people like me aren't magistrate judges..Your honour today's case is about a rapist... (Pedophile / sexual predator etc)Chop it off.,btohqsg
No way to have repeat offenders.,btohqsg
If they commit serial offenses before getting caught...?Mandoline it off and feed it to a goat/pig publicly. (Local anaesthetic only),btohqsg
Most likely I won't live very long. 🤔😏,btohqsg
