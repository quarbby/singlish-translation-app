Updated thoughts on avarga. Read in channel or spam here? Quite a lot lol,btohqsg
1)Goldenapple avarga estimate 2020FY:54Mil net profit(eps0.56)2)myself avarga estimate FY2020 70Mil net (eps 0.074)3)actual avarga 2020FY 74Mil net profit(eps 0.79)Haha wait what? Ps for the spam.. Too excifed,btohqsg
I see avagra chart swee Ley. Power by good result.,btohqsg
As known dividend will propel a stock price.  U see union gas. Dish out total 3.03 cent.At share price 30c it is abt 10%At 60c it is about 5% yield.,btohqsg
So all eye will be on medtec Liao. Haha,btohqsg
That is y alot of investors blindly invest on high yield stock,btohqsg
Some counters even borrow money from bank to payout dividend to keep share price afloat,btohqsg
For FA it is not so simple as in reading financial result. Need to attend agm to know the management. Haha see if they are pretty anot. Like eva,btohqsg
When times r bad  they will need to issue rights to cover their debts.. So high yield might not be good afterall,btohqsg
So avarga business concept is good.. Well Balanced I would say.. Issue 30-40% net payout.. 60% look for business acquisition for long term benefit to the company..,btohqsg
I am just a promoter anyway.. Dyodd hor..,btohqsg
Thanks bro.. Hahah will doydd.. Nowadays counter fall on good result.,btohqsg
I think up la.. Not much excuse now.. 30%above analyst estimate..,btohqsg
Haha.. But the bb inside chat looking.. So they might play dirty,btohqsg

Don't try to have a trading mindset.. It's never easy.. Invest on the company business..,btohqsg
People don't buy stock based purely on the company business leh. People buy stock based on the people's willingness to buy at a higher price so that the initial buyers can grow their assets. Either that or earn through dividend,btohqsg
I find growth stock very volatile,btohqsg
Anyway US looks like a better place to invest on growth stocks,btohqsg
For dividend wise just buy sg will do,btohqsg
Now looks like having rotation in the US side,btohqsg
