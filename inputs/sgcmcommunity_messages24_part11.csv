eh ltr ppl kp say i only care abt how a car corner🥲🥲,btohqsg
i care about both okay! but making a car tht corners better is harder than making a car that is faster on the straights!,btohqsg
Oh the German EVs I refer to is Porsche Taycan and Audi E-tron.I don't consider factory refitted EVs as true EVs 🙈,btohqsg
Well it Depent on how u see Etron and Taycan compare to model s,btohqsg
Oh what I meant that these 2 EVs cars are true electric car platform. And we have economy ones like VW ID 1/2/3/buzz,btohqsg
Oh wait I think ID 1/2/3 aren't true ground up EVs as well...,btohqsg
Ya in your view how u think Taycan compare to model s,btohqsg
I didn't drive both so I can't comment. But reviews online did mention that Taycan have a sportier drive while we all know Tesla and their ludicrous mode,btohqsg
