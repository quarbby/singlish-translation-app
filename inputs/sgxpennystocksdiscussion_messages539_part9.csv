Indeed.. some students can‚Äôt get to the point.. you imagine class 40 students. How much the teacher can help..,btohqsg
Bcos our parents like to compare their kids‚Äô results with others mah end up competition lor then kids suffer. Haiz. Before less bcos most parents cannot financially afford now most earn much more so can spend on tuition lor to compete,btohqsg
True. I used to take my daughter to the school bus stop and heard a mother telling her small boy. ' I want 90%'. Haha!,btohqsg
I say you are brilliant üëç,btohqsg
They compare because still concern..If the students can‚Äôt might it 90% marks.. parents need to balance yourself for your own kid..To encourage more for your own kid.. non of then perfect..,btohqsg
Anyway the auditors are paid by the company. So.they better do as the management say.. or else?,btohqsg
You worry your kid.. doesn‚Äôt matter my view is focus of English language.. after the sec you will see the difference..You might can‚Äôt see the light of pri .. but sec will be change.,btohqsg
Even if this is true then Teachers will take more time to explain n teach the class so it will be clear syllabus cannot be too heavy. But parents give kids tuition then teachers think students can learn so much so end up syllabus gets heavier n parents continue to give their child tuition.,btohqsg
The problem is top 20 sch n Neigbor sch.. different syllabus,btohqsg
Ya. That is why I get real upset people keep blaming Govt when it is themselves who cause the problems. Don‚Äôt compare too much lah. Be contented n do your best,btohqsg
English is difficult even the English people don't know English properly. That's why they have grammar schools!,btohqsg
Yes  after all the beautiful plans  lack of good teachers. If school teachers good  why would parents spend money on tuition? Waste time  waste money,btohqsg
Later can get tuition for kid in poly n University? They must learn how to study by themselves leh.,btohqsg
Yup! Just focus in grammar will do.. this is work .. I have done with my students before..ready story book.,btohqsg
Teach them to think..why how when ..,btohqsg
What you mean pls? Even if syllabus different then parents put child in the Schs their child can cope lor why face so impt,btohqsg
They will be change no worries..after their o level,btohqsg

The parent should ask himself  last time you can or not,btohqsg

Aiyo üòÇüòÇüòÇ so dependent on tuition once come out society to work how to know how to keep learning to upgrade? They kept depending on others to feed them Haiz,btohqsg
Actually a lot of kiasu parents  I really don't understand why need send pri school kids to tuition without letting them learn to be independent,btohqsg
Let said math right.. just ask you child to look for a question alway can‚Äôt might it. Let the tutor to teach.. if your child understand between less than 5 min.. then you can have this tutor.. haha,btohqsg
Primary school syllabus not that difficult,btohqsg

Maths is practice n practice. Learn the basic formulas. If you practice really practice. Then you see the question band know the answer. Without even doing long calculations. This is true even for professional exams,btohqsg
Ya I learn it the tough way too but fortunately did not lose money just lose the size of profit. Haiz,btohqsg
Btw  I took Further Maths in JC last time,btohqsg
I did not teach many year.. sometimes commuter side asking me go back.. I have no time..,btohqsg
