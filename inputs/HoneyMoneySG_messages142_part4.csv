From HSBC:Thank you for waiting  kindly refer to UOB bank to check on the Giro details as some information might be incorrect and causing this to happen.Meanwhile  I would suggest to make manual payment while the Giro issue to be resolved to prevent any late charges or finance charges due to this,btohqsg

Strange. How come can have giro setup so fast? It is less than 2 months. Very unlikely it is fully setup.,btohqsg
Usually it is 3-4 months. If you are lucky  need 2 months.,btohqsg
Setup needs both side. HSBC only can tell your their side  not uob side.,btohqsg
If it shows GIRO PAYMENT  it means fully setup already,btohqsg
Ya. Just that very strange. Less than 2 months. It means when the bill was generated on 01 Nov  giro already setup. It only took 1 month 2 days to setup.,btohqsg
