Done a half day trip to JB on the 1st day. Here are the updates to share with my fellow friends who which to drive up there.1) Make sure you download the apps MySejahtera on your phone . (It equivalent to our trace together apps but it for Malaysia use)a) Register your account either by your phone number or Email Addressb) There will be a glitch issue on the apps for us Singaporean cos we don‚Äôt have a home in Malaysia. So what you need to do is under address side you shall key in your SG address. For postal code   it will only recognise a 5 digit number b4 u can proceed. So just select any johor building postal code . For state   u need to key in b4 u can proceed and u can‚Äôt find SG so just put Johor.c) Once all is done you will b registered with the account.d) Log into the apps with the registered account   you need to submit a soft copy of your vaccination record (you can this extract from MOH side for the records)e) Go under traveller options than select oversea vaccination option and carry on filling up from there and remember to attach the soft copy of the record.2) For the first day of entering  SG toll is at $0.80 cents   the tolls is all waived at JB side for the 1st week from 1-7th Apra) No VEP is currently requiredb) Insurance is not needed at allc) You can do a test at the JB side on the T&G card if you still have it to see if it still valid.d) There are staffs there readily to sell you T&G if u need to buy one although you will not need it for this 1 week.e) For my case the JB side did not check anything  but I know from previous ones some people were to ask to see their phone if they have downloaded the MySejahtera apps.f) For now there no reports on them checking into the system to make sure you have the vaccination status so just carry a physical or soft copy just in case if they ask for it. (No harm right)3) Once you clear customs everything is back to usual  Street wise I think it still quite ok . There are still quite a number of shops around.a) So far I went KSL I see a occupancy of like 85% which is pretty good far from my expectation . Met a guy from SG he visited AEON mall he say that side was pretty ok too. So  you all still can do your normal shoppingb) So far I think the place is still ok but of course you still need to be careful but just act normal like everyone is you will be fine.4) Money Changer   So far I have seen the one at Petronas is open  the one at B point is open and only one in KSL is open at the lower level where the supermarket is. ( BTW TESCO in KSL is gone and replace by LOTUS)5) All petrol stations are operating6) Car wash  a lot of car wash shop have close down due to covid . I went to Legend at B-point the one when u exit from JB custom . A lot car wash are close around that area. Boss say they just started back to biz today. There are some other car wash around KSL side are open and the few popular car workshop are all still there.7) Coming back to SG make sure you have the health declaration fill up before you reach the counter else you will hold up the queue at the counter . This can be done prior to the arrival at SG anytime within 3 daysa) Under ICA website you can find checklist for fully vaccinated travellersb) Select And check Box C for SG arrival card and just do all the declaration and you are done.c) Once you reach the counter the system will show you done the declaration and the passport clearance will b fast. else you might hold up the queue behind you.D) For today case there are officers standby b4 we reach the counter to facilitate us the process faster as they know many of us are unaware of this.üòé That it and you will b back in SG . The process is not that difficult. Just additional stuff you need to do. But at least we get to travel right?,btohqsg
So which is the option you choice 2nd does or both or booster?,btohqsg
Waaaa thank you for this detail walkthrough. üòç really appreciate!!!,btohqsg

I was once given this volume for a single motorbike order. üòÖ I was asking customer to cancel on their side since it‚Äôs at least 3x the allowed bike luggage volume.In the end LLM CS asked me to take part of it when the client negotiated it and didn‚Äôt want to incur cancellation costs. I sent those 5 pink boxes only  the brown cartons were handled separately by another LLM order.,btohqsg
Funny hor they rather not pay cancellation than pay 2 ppl to do the same amount of work,btohqsg
I had a shock when I saw Regular <3 this morning. I thought I became 80 years old üòõ,btohqsg
If they cancelled  I think they need to pay something like 50% to LLM or me for doing nothing.I dunno how the math works though. Can do the job? Just do lor‚Ä¶.If physically impossible  then I won‚Äôt insist. Those were birds‚Äô nest - if I dropped it while riding  good luck to me!,btohqsg
How‚Äôs regular btw? Never tried before,btohqsg

hi can anyone help to locate this driver.probably a Lalamove driver?a hit and run happened this morning. thank you :),btohqsg
U all go around Singapore or stay one region take and go then wait new order again,btohqsg
Cheapo. Hoping car come take. Cos alot of orders obviously bike cannot take or they will order bike but write want car  then car drivers will still go take even though its bike price. Cos alot of drivers need to make money,btohqsg
So the vendors know liao  so they will just keep ordering bike even though its alot of stuff to deliver,btohqsg
Supposedly the person arranging didn‚Äôt take note.I don‚Äôt believe lor. The physical item is at their workplace  how not to know‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If got pple come take then ok liao. Then anytg happen they will blame delivery pple nvr take proper care n then we have to take responsibility,btohqsg
Most of the time llm will side with the vendors cos they r the customers. Biz is from them. N so many delivery drivers/riders,btohqsg
Recently i jus accept a bike jobs as is  not far away. To my surprise after waiting for 1 hours. It consist of around 30 bowl or noodle n soup.,btohqsg
Yes correct. They purposely 1 and hope car will accept the jobs.  Some user more worse. Once they request bike and bike accept the jobs. They cancel n post again.,btohqsg
Now that you mentioned it; there was one job that I accepted - only to see it gone from my Ongoing queue‚Ä¶ and found it in Cancelled.Funny thing was  IIRC  the job reappeared and I accepted again - and got cancelled again.This was almost two weeks ago so I might have remembered some parts wrong.But yes  I‚Äôm on a motorbike.,btohqsg
Actually bike have more high demand than cars. I used it sometimes and could see cars are cheaper than bike.,btohqsg
anyone here do grabfood bicycle using car anot ah?,btohqsg

It's free. Calling the police is a bonus for them... just adds to the harassment.,btohqsg
Everyday police at the door taking statements... all the neighbours looking. Pretty much doing what the loanshark intended: name and shame.,btohqsg
At least the police getting paid to work. We get nothing  lose out on petrol  parking  time and energy.,btohqsg
Anti cash job unless is food,btohqsg
Just finish statement now continue wait for job,btohqsg
Waiting to see which person rig gauge and caught red-handed,btohqsg
Sure a lot of check la... Gahmen want you buy exp oil in sg,btohqsg
ya lo. i also curious to know what job detail,btohqsg
For those cash order... Rem to call log. Else if kana scam and no call log  LLM will reject yr compensation,btohqsg
Hard to void one. Ah long got so many number... They kana block by LLM they create another account. Just on yr luck only,btohqsg
Ok lah. But hassle parking with fees  your nett income only how much,btohqsg

Then I hear the owner say it was a scam from fb,btohqsg
Super angry with the CS hopeless,btohqsg
I report it was a scam order and have police report then the Cs say ok I will cancel the job for you thank you,btohqsg
Have is the loan shark that make the order,btohqsg
The story is like that I got the order from the loan shark ask to go to this condo collect money from the maid,btohqsg
And when I reach there the owner say it was a scam,btohqsg
Say that they try to scam the maid money,btohqsg
Then after that the owner go report police ask me wait for the police to come,btohqsg
I was there from around 1.30hours,btohqsg

Now the day loan shark smart call lalmove to go collect money,btohqsg
And when I was there the owner was talking with the scammer some the scammer say if you don't want to pay the money is ok I will keep call difference ppls to go down to collect,btohqsg

You all prefer short trip or long trip pay higher,btohqsg

Ask so much no use 1,btohqsg
Do first get the hang of things lah. Some pple here do ft  some do pt,btohqsg
Some do whole day  some do certain timing,btohqsg
Some like cash job  some like credit,btohqsg
Some do phv with delivery  some do just delivery,btohqsg
So how u gg to get a concrete answer? Only by trying out everything then u will figure out,btohqsg
It's not I guailan n not trying to be helpful  just my thoughts.,btohqsg

Now then I know who is the black sheep who give my 1 star,btohqsg
But if you cannot call. They already warn you  otherwise the kick you out of llm,btohqsg
Just to defend myself. This was due to initial driver cancel. I was replacement driver... Then give funny2 direction.,btohqsg
But if I ignore  I happy. This is just work for fun lah...dun need to waste my blood vessels,btohqsg
U go confront. Mean intentional...u out of llm bro,btohqsg
Exactly. That Is why llm close the issue. But then never change or remove rating..,btohqsg
Too busy to make big fuss,btohqsg
U think easy to pursue this matter?,btohqsg
By the way not sure if this has been spoken before  I think there will be over supply of driver in the coming weeks,btohqsg
I heard from radio. Llm put an advertising to get driver to work for llm freelance..lols,btohqsg
I assume  it's all through the jot form??,btohqsg
This Yum Cha Orders had been a scammer order.,btohqsg
I take 5 times  they always last mins or hours cancellation,btohqsg
I had posted up last Sunday to reminder lala delivery ppl to take note this order. Try not to take unless you really need it.,btohqsg
I guess may be Lalamove give credits for restaurants who hit the min. orders  then Yum Cha creates orders and cancel orders inordet to get the benefits without the needs to pay llm commission.,btohqsg
Then bad luck on me :(,btohqsg
May be use LIVE EXPRESS RIDERS app,btohqsg
That y I kick Yum Cha out of our group list,btohqsg
The fare doesn't seems to be good today even lunch hour  is it only me or the rest also?,btohqsg
See n relax . Ljf plus hot weather cannot move,btohqsg
Yup i think the fare is getting worse,btohqsg
Maybe trying to flush out excessive riders,btohqsg
Now motorcycle multi stop trip becomes $4+ per stopUsed to be $6,btohqsg
Need to go town then got order,btohqsg
Told me cancellation fee cannot claim if the job is cancelled before I reach the pickup point.,btohqsg
Even if I have confirmed the order. Meaning the merchants can suka suka cancel anytime as long as I haven't reach the shop. If I was 15-20mins away when I pickup n confirm the order  then I drive all the way down then just when I parking they cancel I also won't get cancellation fee. Kns,btohqsg
The email say during training they got state only when reached the pickup b4 they cancel then can get the cancellation fee. I don't remember training got say.,btohqsg
Like that this is wrong lor then how can they put this hereü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
No protection for riders at all,btohqsg
They suka suka can amend the rules 1,btohqsg
I reached the resto even earlier then the order driver somemore,btohqsg
Customer end and our own support side both also tekkan us. How to continue doing,btohqsg
The thing is  I never had this reason given to me before. Always can claim cancellation fee when order confirmed and is cancelled after confirmed. Even when nvr reach the resto yet,btohqsg
Then this time suddenly give me this stupid excuse. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
The 50% fee for this job isn't that much. It's only $10  but this not about the money liao. It's about what is entitled to us  and about being fair to us,btohqsg
After rant here cool off  carry on lah. Dun do anything silly arh  not worth it.Know that there are others who also went through this. You ain't alone.,btohqsg
In this case  it sounds like she is unintentional but dun even realise/how to rectify her mistake.,btohqsg
Wish n hope all drivers luck. Job don't get cancelled before reaching restoüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya I thought my phone got problem,btohqsg
iPhone also crashed ..like that how to complete the job üòÖ,btohqsg

Then what if the advanced orders eg at 5pm or 515pm driver cannot access app now  then later when app ok the user throw out double orders cos desperate. Then cancel job  all cannot claim feeüòÇ,btohqsg
Prob can get orders with ++$ later  but be careful of double  triple orders,btohqsg

They say the apps is okay already but why i can log in,btohqsg
Usual fare. Like that very long liao. Not gg to get covid time fares anymore lah,btohqsg
festive season fare also not bad ma. this type of fare want to cover rental also hard.,btohqsg
U also say festive season mah üòÇ,btohqsg
Now less jobs more drivers how to have higher fare,btohqsg
hari raya coming. should up ma. haha,btohqsg
Fare low jobs also snatched up fast. No need for higher fares,btohqsg
It's not just drivers. Customers also very difficult to ctc llm. Even customers use livechat then have to wait foreverüòÇ,btohqsg

I will keep this as a habit Liao haha,btohqsg
CS also stupid one. Only keep ask for yr call log.,btohqsg

Okok  honestly I didn't notice the contact till I can call thru customer.,btohqsg
And usually i also avoid cash job,btohqsg
I just dont like cash job.. later halfway they cancel u,btohqsg
I somehow like it.. no need to go ATM draw moneyüòÖ,btohqsg
CS normally will ask... Did u call b4 reaching the pick up... Just say yes w call log. Then they will send u jotform,btohqsg
To me cash job = nt serious one,btohqsg
Last time CS more hardworking.. they will send u another job API.. now I don't think so anymore,btohqsg
And i think some cash jobs is tell u go collect $ from other ppl so beware,btohqsg
Since this is a credit order.  CS can make a compensation.. if cash..then good luck,btohqsg
Last time also got cash job give high amt one and tell u bank in to western union,btohqsg
U help them trf.. then become police case.. or yr $ also gone case. Haha,btohqsg
But stil got ppl gudu and do,btohqsg
Oh ya! One more thing to ask.. cause sometime we will grab 2 job and is it ok after picked up 2 orders without sliding the pick up?,btohqsg
Cause I know after sliding the pick up mean you have to complete the job by 1 hr,btohqsg
Have to ar.. u have to pick up within 30mins,btohqsg
Don't stack if u not confidence .. else u have to answer for yr late. Haha,btohqsg
Peak hour amk.. kovan all jam one. So becareful,btohqsg
Really ar! I actually tried without sliding pick up till I reach the delivery location then slide for pick up,btohqsg
So far there is no issue for it,btohqsg

You wont be able to take cash job that have higher commission than your balance  so will need to topup to take those. Most drivers leave a bit behind when cashing out.,btohqsg
Lucky I don‚Äôt take cash job,btohqsg

I will only do multi stop if its got such additional fee,btohqsg
N the distance fee is little bit means don't need travel far,btohqsg
Does lala 10ft driver assist to move kingsize bed?,btohqsg
Food. Most multi stop is non oddle,btohqsg
I feeel very stranger when not send food,btohqsg
Especially is go ppl house take,btohqsg
Is this the wrong place to ask?,btohqsg
I also dont take too many multistops. more than 4 stops is probably a nono as i feel it is a waste of time,btohqsg
For van orderHow to add helper when needed? After knowing it is overloading as per order description,btohqsg

Five things to take note of before heading over to JB this weekend - CNAhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/what-changed-johor-bahru-covid-19-travellers-2614091,btohqsg
Where got worth it? First weekend hit 7 orders  won't get $50 voucher  only next weekends hit 7 orders then get $50 voucher. In total  you need to do at least14 orders to get $50 voucher.,btohqsg
It's 7 orders per day for fri-sun then can get,btohqsg
If any of the 3 days u don't do 7 bike order u won't get,btohqsg
They won't attract pple do all the bike orders lah  cos more bike orders mah,btohqsg
So that low price pple also take just to complete the incentive,btohqsg
grabpandaroo incentives and surges all concentrated on weekend. dont think the $50 petrol voucher can compete  7 llm orders will definitely block out the lunch/dinner peak hours.,btohqsg
All llm incentive is not high 1 lah,btohqsg
I just do usual job. If hit mission or incentive then take,btohqsg
Won't purposely take low price etc just to hit. Not very worth it now that petrol more n more expensive,btohqsg
But that's my own opinion lah,btohqsg
Have u all ever sent wrong food order b4,btohqsg
Missing food item yes...but not wrong food order,btohqsg
What happen then ? Kenna ban ?,btohqsg
No order chit no description....i don't even know wat food they ordered üòÇ,btohqsg
Just go back and resend the right one....luckily nearby...no complaints were made.,btohqsg
Good day all. Check with you guys  the latest jobs don‚Äôt provide any description upfront yes? Or is it just me?,btohqsg
Unless we scroll to accept the job. ... it don‚Äôt happened previously.,btohqsg
Like this must add extra stop charge and also distance fare. N if restaurant in cbd n u out of cbd have to add extra cbd chargw,btohqsg
I kena b4  told resto got extra charge they say ok. Then live chat Cs tell them to add accordingly,btohqsg
But if its ur super regular resto then maybe u just private nego bahüòÇ,btohqsg
I mean if u turn back  pls remember ask for all theseüòÇ,btohqsg
