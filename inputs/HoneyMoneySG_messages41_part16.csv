oh it's 4 months. I keep thinking its 3 months and wondering why you deposit in Apr.,btohqsg
My money itâ€™s been lock ðŸ”’,btohqsg
need to do 5 fast transfer in the month also? or that is only needed for the 1% income tax rebate?,btohqsg
Citi pay all has a promotion now. 2.2 miles per $1. Is this conversion worth the fee that I will pay when executing the citi Payall transaction?,btohqsg
Actually quite confused . Maybe I just put on 3 months FD 3.75% it would be a safe option,btohqsg
I dont have that much to pay. I am poor. Donâ€™t pay that much tax,btohqsg
I was confused also and planning to test out just for the last one month. In case do wrongly the opportunity cost lesser. I registered in March.,btohqsg
HSBC got 2 promo  the 2K in and 5 x FAST transfer to non HSBC bank is for the everyday+ promo for the additional 1% based on previous month. is not a must to do  unless u want the additional 1%  is like an icing to the cake,btohqsg
If I just want the Bonus Interest promotion and I registered in Mar  I still can top up on 1 May and get the full bonus interest on the amount I topup on 1 May  for 2 months May and June right?,btohqsg
I think the answer is wrong .,btohqsg
You are not eligible to earn that interest,btohqsg
HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Apr EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of JAN23 to MAR23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
I am utilising my Mar promo. it was a higher interest rate I think... so my reference month different from you...,btohqsg
mine looks like this:HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
if u are March-June cycle  your reference month for BI is Feb  so March-June will compare to Feb ADB,btohqsg
so I can still top up on 1st May and withdraw on 1Jul  and treat it like a 2 months fixed D?,btohqsg
Anyone know for the SC smart card  the promo run by moneysmart is it stacking with their own SC promo of $200 cashback upon activating the card ? And does it affect the $500 min spending for the reward,btohqsg
just make sure u got SMS on March to enroll the BI,btohqsg
May I know do we have to maintain at least 2k until we get the interest right ?,btohqsg
I got this:HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
Trazora say no need  but I would rather leave the 2K there  up to you. I dont want to risk 4 month interest just for a tiny 2K  bank can claim that as ineligible if they want,btohqsg
I think you still need the 2k to avoid the fall below fee?,btohqsg
Can I ask for your opinion ? Is there anything Iâ€™ve miss ? . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 an then sms HSBC 74722forregister step 2 put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I donâ€™t have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw 98k out left 2k until get the interest . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
for HSBC personal need 2K to avoid FBF,btohqsg
