And markets themselves as the ones saving the planet and having sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing facilities,btohqsg
Them getting kicked off the ESG index says something,btohqsg

Iâ€™m planning to get a second hand car but not sure which car would be reliable for daily usage,btohqsg
What's your budget? Requirements? Brand preference? Age preference?,btohqsg
30k for 1 year  30k for 5 years?,btohqsg
Mainly asking for brand which are good and reliable. I took a look at a Jetta yesterday and did my research before viewing and notice DSG gearbox would have an issue,btohqsg
If you really want something super reliable and don't care for the driving experience,btohqsg
Go with any Toyota that fits the budget and passes a pre purchase inspection for chassis damage and major issues,btohqsg
For hatchbacks  can consider Honda fits,btohqsg
2014-2015 mark should fit your budget,btohqsg
Still parf so you will get the ARF rebate upon scrapping as well (not much for these cars but can help as added budget as you know you'll get it back),btohqsg
the 2009 ones also not bad,btohqsg
A bit too old for the price range for me  leaves you with a long time for the same price,btohqsg
But never know when it'll fall apart,btohqsg
MY 2014-15 throw in and drive for 2 years  don't need to worry about too much as such,btohqsg

If you want something more sporty to drive  can consider the swift sport,btohqsg
MY 2010-11 with 5 year COE renewal are available on the market,btohqsg
