Mini mouth came for PanUnited. Recovery in tact for this counter.,btohqsg
PanUnited  today close $0.31 will be powerful. After the last spike  they rested consolidated $0.29 - $0.30. Reversal on the way. Last time round already cleared $0.325. This time should be easy with construction counters strong. Steady and stable counter. One to watch for the long term holders üí™üèº,btohqsg

This kind of timing at supermarket,btohqsg
Hosen - tried some small lots $0.082. Seeing that Del Monte have some play.Also  the Suez Canal delay would mean that stranded vessels might deplete their food supplies as the voyage time have unexpectedly increased. Perhaps  there might be increased demands for canned items this period to tide through this delay. Let‚Äôs see. DYODD . This one purely my assumption. I do not know what foods / stuffs or how much the vessels stocks up üòÇAnyways based on charts there‚Äôs strong support here $0.080. Descending triangle break up or down though ? Time will tell,btohqsg
