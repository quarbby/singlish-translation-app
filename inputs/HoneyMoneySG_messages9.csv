But I didn‚Äôt have an option to choose what I wanted my name to be on it and this i applying for their card. Anyway thank you I‚Äôll call them up,btohqsg
Same as mine last time. But i didnt call to change. It might have additional charge.,btohqsg
I just applied and submitted but I did not receive any follow up email or reference number for me to key in to submit my rewards claim. Any idea? Or do I need to wait a little bit longer?,btohqsg
Hmm.. last time its has been generated after submission. That was March 2022. Maybe different now? Also did you had a in-principal-approval?,btohqsg

Hi all  for Revolut  'top up S$300 with a bank account to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the 20% cashback offer for that month  the excess cash can be transferred back to your own bank account in future'. Can we top up $300 & immediately transfer back $200 back to account & still be eligible for the 20% cashback? Thanks.,btohqsg
My Citi cashback card got approved!,btohqsg
$300 top up is the requirement  what you do after that doesn't matter as long as you don't abuse the transfers,btohqsg
I hope you got in on a promotion  there's $350 available,btohqsg
Hi if I link my citi premier mile card to Instarem n uses the Instarem MC to pay sp bill  do I get the points for my premiere mile card?,btohqsg
Hi all does grab card to revoult top up still works,btohqsg
Am trying to use SRS to buy S27 via POEMS - anyone has any idea how to know how many units I can buy as its in USD or I have to ownself estimate the exchange rate and ensure total cost in USD is lower than the SRS SGD funds with agent bank ?,btohqsg
If the app can accept the credit card  then by right it shd work. For now I only used Grabpay MC and DBS mastercard which both are ok. Tried Amex  cannot link. Nv tried CDC and Jipay.,btohqsg
Ownself estimate and make sure you have enough SGD in your account.Settlement currency in SGD,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wish to check if anyone is aware if foreigners come sg  are they able to use their bank visa or Mastercard to tap onto the bus or enter mrt? Or they need to change to sgd first?,btohqsg
Can  but might not be worth as they are charged an additional $0.60 for each day's fare charged.,btohqsg
So it will be better if they use like youtrip or revolut to convert to sgd first the  use?,btohqsg
Most likely yes. Even without the admin fee I'd think it'll still be cheaper to convert first since youtrip/revolut offers fx at wholesale rate instead of the crappy ones offered through normal CC.,btohqsg
Sorry for a noob question- I alr opened Phillip Smart Portfolio with the initial $300. But how to add money in to invest?,btohqsg

Looking to apply for my 1st credit card  any suggestions?Is there a video in explaining how a credit card works?Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Start with Citi premiermiles card since it has the highest sign up gift now. Meanwhile slowly learn how a credit card works,btohqsg
What kind of credit card are you looking for? Miles  cashback??,btohqsg
I see. Personally for myself. I'm using the UOB AMEX Credit Card where I get 1.7% cashback + Grabpay card because AMEX is not widely accepted in every shop therefore converting it to a MasterCard using Grab. Other than that  I don't really use anything else.,btohqsg
My card cannot cancel within 12 months or the reward will be returned...,btohqsg
So only 2nd year I can apply for the bank again? (With regards to credit card churning),btohqsg

hi guys  which credit cards would you recommend for flights and hotels?,btohqsg
but I'm not quite into miles as it's too hard to calculate  what about cash-back cards?,btohqsg
I have Citi's Cashback+ and StanChart's Smart card  mostly for the signup bonuses. Thinking about HSBC Revolution,btohqsg

For the hotel booking does anyone knows if hsbc Revolution card must be paid online or at the hotel itself to clock 4mpd?,btohqsg
UOB  absolute or Amex true cashback?,btohqsg
I'm using AMEX TC  but the difference is very small,btohqsg

CitiPM is 1.2mpd  are u confusing it with citi rewards card? That one has limit of 1k for 4mpd,btohqsg
Using this card just for booking hotels. So 10miles a dollar so wondering if there‚Äôs a cap for that 10miles,btohqsg
a quick googling led me to this doc:https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/kaligo-accelerated-miles-and-thankyousm-poins-promotion-june.pdf?ecid=PSGONSGBGPENAWtake note it's only with kaligo  agoda is 7 miles instead. doesn't seem to have a limit and it's only valid till end 2022. i seldom use this since these 3rd party partnership sites usually jack up the price. but might be worth exploring again if it's 10x miles i guess üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah I search about agoda and kaligo as well for the miles. Cause if I plan to spent 4k for travel and if there‚Äôs a cap k rather charge seperate to another card. As what I know HSBC revolution card has a 1k cap for miles. You mention 3rd party partnership jack up the prices may I know where do you usually book your stats or flights at? Or maybe can you share what card you use for travel,btohqsg
if it's more than 1K i usually just use my CitiPM anyway  i guess on hindsight i didn't really calculate whether the higher cost on kaligo/agoda is worth the additional miles  sorry can't share much on that.yea if its really high cost 4K i guess u just have to go with general miles card... even DBSWM has a cap on 2K,btohqsg
I think got lots of video at youtube. Better search there.,btohqsg

Yes. I think because everyone top up  ezlink fully. So there no balance in jipay. They simply cannot use it for their investment or loans etc. So they cancel out. But at least they shld wait until next month. Straight away all cashback gone. Real BS,btohqsg

Yes. Seem like a lot of scammer around.,btohqsg
Hi all. Curious if there‚Äôs any platforms offering fractional trading for SG stocks?,btohqsg
Does shopback and fave pay works similar that u can use the cashback by going back to the same merchant previously?,btohqsg
But shopback allows u the option to transfer to your bank account as well?,btohqsg
Not that i know of. But Singapore ETFs can buy 1 unit,btohqsg
Will the cardup be considered eligible spend for the Krisflyer Amex card? (Just to double confirm that it is indeed eligible as there is a up to 17 050 miles promo),btohqsg
Any other way to transfer NS55 credits to bank other than Jipay method?,btohqsg
ezlink top up still good using amex grab jipay method?,btohqsg
Stick with grab card can already,btohqsg
is there better way than this?,btohqsg
for Paynow payment any hacks? or just grab...,btohqsg
Not I know of. Try to find out too.,btohqsg
Already test several card. But all failed to link jipay or did not have any cashback,btohqsg
Cdc more nerfing. Lol. Still dare to continue nerf.,btohqsg
Ok la  at least they gave a 6 months headsup to nerf spotify / netflix,btohqsg
Not immediate cut like they used to lol,btohqsg
Hope they don't nerf the loungekey access. Now only use it for lounge.,btohqsg
wait till international travel goes full swing everywhere like it used to... they might nerf lol,btohqsg
Talking about CDC airport lounge. I get charged 3.25USD per entry. It will return to card I believe after a certain period. You have any experience on thisJJ01,btohqsg
One month later they will refund,btohqsg
Can we stop staking money and still enjoy the free spotify (for cdc)?,btohqsg
This cdc card becoming more and more useless ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
The 2% is less and less worth it,btohqsg
But the lounge just need the physical card right? Don‚Äôt need to actually stake,btohqsg
Yes. If u have the jade green card or equivalent above.,btohqsg
Time to unstake 6 months later,btohqsg
If can just unstake and sell everything. Now crypto dangerous.,btohqsg
Not financial advise. Just my own take. üòä,btohqsg
I still have hope for CRO to come up. Just stop buying more,btohqsg
Hello guys  for Revolut if I want to be entitled to the 20% cash back  can I top up the $300 at any point time throughout the month for it to be activated?Or does it has to be done during a specific calendar period e.g. Towards the end of Jul for it to activate on Aug,btohqsg
Now just BEAR winter period.. no choice,btohqsg
basket they revise again the new email lol,btohqsg
Yes you can do with as long as before the calendar month ends. No specific date within the month,btohqsg
Does ji pay works in Vietnam?,btohqsg
I am unable to sync Amaze card to Samsung Pay or Google Pay.Anyone have suggestions to make it work?,btohqsg
Amaze isn't supported on Samsung pay. You should be able to link Google pay though,btohqsg
Does grab accept amaze? My top up was unsuccessful just wait for auto reverse?,btohqsg
Yes and No. It works but with very high transaction fees...,btohqsg
You mean Amaze to Grab? Seems both of them do not accept prepaid cards. You can check if a card is prepaid with the BIN (first 6 or 8 digits of card number),btohqsg
hmmm I link my stand chart cashback debit to amaze,btohqsg
And then use amaze to top up grab?,btohqsg
U got debit cred card YouTrip?,btohqsg
Just use it to pay cc bills or other bills on axs via paynow,btohqsg
Sorry ah. After read tnc I still not sure. So I applied UOB absolute topup $3k to grab. Will I get the $150 welcome bonus?,btohqsg
So mind as wel just spent on credit card?,btohqsg
Revolut which get 20% cashback  is it only for Revolut singapore account? What if register revolut with other country account?,btohqsg
would UOB flag me if I consistently top up thousands every month to grab using their card?,btohqsg
I topped up $1K for 3 months for work expenses  you are using their service  why should they flag you?,btohqsg
I've been doing so with AMEX for months  no problem so far,btohqsg
Hi all  is paying groceries using FairPrice app considered online transaction (for citibank rewards card)?,btohqsg
Same question for mcd order via mobile app ü§î,btohqsg
yes  I just tried that last week,btohqsg
and I believe so for MCD app,btohqsg
So i guess works for DBS WWMC too?,btohqsg
And if you want to be 100% safe  you can pay with the AMAZE card on those apps,btohqsg
Ah yes  but this still works for CRMC,btohqsg
Hi all  is paywave considered offline or online transaction?,btohqsg
If I am not wrong should be offline,btohqsg
Hi all  I am new here. May I know what‚Äôs a use case for jipay ? I just top up my JiPay with Amex thinking I can top up my ez link but realized now from discussion above that it is being nerfed.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good use for jipay*,btohqsg
You can still top up EZ-Link with JiPay  justno Cashback,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant. What are other good ways of using Jipay ? Or are the ways similar to using Amex now since both offer similar cashback with min spend?,btohqsg
You can still earn cashback if you use the card for any meals (direct card payment to restaurants   food court) or public transport,btohqsg
Havent test whether can earn cashback if pay via fave or shopback pay,btohqsg
@MartinSeah  I'll repost your message hereHello@ChrisHMSG  please let me know any edition required for this summary of your video. I have made a summary so that I can do a follow up after watch your videos many times. Many thanks#CPF#Chris@HoneyMoneySgBEST CPF Strategies for Self-Employed Persons (SEP)SUMMARY1. Mandatory contribution 8% of your Net Trade Income (of above $18k if you are below 35yo) into Medisave account  which can help you to pay for hospital bills and your integrated shield plans with private insurers.- > See Table 1.2. Do a Retirement Sum Top up (RSTU) to get the 4% annual interest a year and be eligible for tax relief in the Special Account for (recipients below age 55) or Retirement Account (for recipients age 55 and above).Another way is to top up your family member's Special Account / Retirement Account  who did not earn more than $4k that year in order for you to be qualified  for tax relief.You can contribute up to $7k RSTU to self and another max of $7k for a total of $1 400 total tax relief.3. To enhance your CPF balances by doing a voluntary contributions to all 3 CPS Accounts : OA  MA and SA/RA.The max you can get for tax relief for your Medisave and voluntary CPF contribution will be capped at the lower of- 37% of your net trade income assessment; or- CPF relief cap of $37 740 or- Actual amount contributed by youExample :Net Trade Income : $100kCPF Relief cap : 37% * 100k = $37k.Mandatory MA (see Table 1) : 8% * 100k = $8k.Vol. Contribution Gap = $37k-$8k = $29kRSTU Top-up (to self)  = $7kTOTAL CPF RELIFE = $37K+$7=$44K wor!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-36ZR7WGESw,btohqsg
Generally correct  other than cpf tax relief cap updated to $8k per year (both rstu & vcma combined)Also  I'd prefer to VCMA first  then RSTU,btohqsg
Thanks  more options to earn cashback,btohqsg
Hey guys  I‚Äôm planning for my trip to Australia and there‚Äôs going to be a lot of travel spending  some of which will be in foreign currencies. What‚Äôs the best card for it?,btohqsg
Usuallay I use Citi Rewards + AMAZE for overseas spending  but Citi Rewards doesn‚Äôt work with travel related spending,btohqsg
For other cards  even they offer 4mpd for online spending  their 3% FCY just eats up all gainsü§£,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Mastercard with Amaze (assuming from your name that you're female),btohqsg
Is this only for females? Or just like DBS Women cardü§£,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not the only one paying bills haha,btohqsg
Yeah Females only  Male not eligible to apply,btohqsg
"Hi all  any idea when does the 1K ""Limit"" on CRMC resets?",btohqsg
Are there any male options you'll recommend? Looking  to plan a few trips ahead too üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi all. I just noticed that JiPay nerfed cash back to EZ-Link top ups. Anyone else noticed this too?,btohqsg
and they even reversed previous cashback... previously the jipay referral also like that,btohqsg
Not much good option  other than Citi Cashback+ 1.6% with Amaze,btohqsg
Thanks. Guess have to review the stacking tactic again.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  guess I'll consider the use of GrabPay with AMEX combos in that case üòÇ,btohqsg
Actually  why not amex > grab > revolut. Save the fx fees too,btohqsg
From one of your past video  one of the bad things about revolut is the spread during the weekend. But citi caskback + can only redeem in $10 block  which is 625$ of spending.So it‚Äôs AMEX 1.5% immediate cash back  or CITI cashback + with 1.6% cashback in block of $10.So I think both way works. But what do each one prefers.,btohqsg
And I saw from a grab related GC  someone already hit the grab 30K annual spending. So do consider that as well.,btohqsg
Amex TCB? 1% on top of 1.5% ... their exchange rate is üëçüèæ,btohqsg
sorry just see that it is expiring soon,btohqsg
oops  but anyway  I believe AMEX still charges FX fees  say  3%?,btohqsg
Amex>grab>jipay>revolut. Gets the you the grab points,btohqsg
I'll keep at least $250 in grab just to do jipay. With or without spending any money,btohqsg
AMEX to grab 1.5%  Grab to jipay 1.2%*. Jipay back to grab 0%  Grab to Revolut 0%.,btohqsg
maybe only use up the $250 every month of jipay every month. Just kind of confusing seem like many merchants does not get the 1.5%,btohqsg
Just make use of the $250 grab... otherwise its surely gonna get nerf'd by this year,btohqsg
full 1.2% only if you are Platinum in grab,btohqsg
Hi there  what is the best card to get to pair with Amaze for travel spending ? I saw one of the previous videos recommending Citi cash back but that‚Äôs mainly for groceries and petrol  but are there any recommendations for more casual purchases ?,btohqsg
DBS WWMC cannot use for Fave pay  utility bill companies: like singtel  starhub  TPG and viewquest. So any others option?,btohqsg
Haha you have the same question as mine,btohqsg
haha yeah I think I saw the reply,btohqsg
looking for a male friendly option haha,btohqsg
DBS WWMC used to be the best option even for males  but it just explicitly excluded AMAZE spending. Quite sad,btohqsg
yeah  I‚Äôm leaning towards Citi just because of Amaze. My initial plan was to get both the Citi Premier Miles and Citi Rewards. Citi Premier miles to get sign on bonus (15k + 10k annual premium payment)  and overseas spending when needed and Citi Rewards for local spending,btohqsg
Singtel Starhub Viewquest should be able ah? It's not classified under Utilities like SP Services isn't it,btohqsg
oic  because i see on the category classified under bills  utility and taxes  thanks,btohqsg
I remember my Starhub M1 bills all got points,btohqsg
üëçthanks a lot  so only SP bill is excluded,btohqsg
What you get for the sign on bonus?,btohqsg
right now direct from Citi website for the Citi Premier Miles card you‚Äôll get 15k miles after $800 spending for 2 months.,btohqsg
Only for new users I guess?,btohqsg
Nice May I know if I book agoda for flights and hotel do I get 4 miles? Cause I don‚Äôt understand if I need to book through a link or smth to get the Citi promotion miles,btohqsg
jipay account sign up seems dodgy and collects so much personal information - probably resell our data  any advantage remaining for jipay?,btohqsg
Any sign up gift from jipay?,btohqsg
Btw this is $800 within the 2 moths right?,btohqsg
the target are domestic helpers and children,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm right one you‚Äôre paying the annual fee of $197 another is opting out of it,btohqsg
depends  but I would say it‚Äôs worth,btohqsg
does UOB evol tracking go by statement month or calender month?,btohqsg
Don't worry man  this is a feature of going public,btohqsg
I will just continue providing value for this community,btohqsg
Think different: if every one agrees with what you do  then you're doing something boring enough,btohqsg
Dk if can complain pdpa if data was declared to be used as KYC purposes alone ü§î,btohqsg
Has the revolut Cashback for this month come in yet?,btohqsg
Thanks  realised that last month's requirement was 200  not the usual 100  no wonder I didn't see anything coming in.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGyo bro chillax hahaha just finished your latest video..,btohqsg
Agree with your points not sure why people like to judge others just listen with an open mind and fine tune to fit into own personal lifestyle can liao ma. üòÖ Put those hate comments for what sia.,btohqsg
Any good method to waive annual for UOB amex absolute?,btohqsg
Hmm no more 1.5% Cashback from jipay? Didn't see it on their website or app,btohqsg
https://www.jipay.app/rewardclick here you will see it,btohqsg
Have you tried and failed or just asking?,btohqsg
@Vinn96thanks for sharing no more 1.5% cashback come 1 Aug 2022,btohqsg
Huh? Not China bah? The founder is actually a Ukrainian lol,btohqsg
Hey Chris  just wanted to say not to take in too much negativity from the public. If anything  im pretty sure the community we have here appreciate everything you've put up for us,btohqsg
1st Aug jipay will be totally useless.,btohqsg
I mean to be frank  it's pretty useless the moment they clawed all the EZ Link cashback üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi guys. I just opened TDA and try to sell option. Any idea what is the exchange referring to? What should i select?,btohqsg
Oh may I know how much you spent in total? My one still under 1 year‚Ä¶,btohqsg
hi  for webull  roughly how long after u have made 6 trades and kept 2k in the account would you receive the free apple shares? deposited on 22 june..6th trade done on 6 july. have not received the shares yet,btohqsg
After that need to hold for 30 days if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
You can go to the promotion page to see your progress,btohqsg
ah ok thanks..i see it now..it wasnt there earlier,btohqsg
Time to throw the card away together with CDC.,btohqsg
"No fee for Grab topup for up to $250 before August.But from August  ALL Grab topup subjected to 2.5% fee.""Additionally  all top ups made via GrabPay will not be subsidised from August 2022 onwards. All Grab top-ups will be subject to a 2.5% fee. """,btohqsg
I believe all those cash back program are customer acquisition cost. You can say that it‚Äôs marketing cost. But sadly they can only give cashback to small amount of customers. 1.5% cashback to 1k customer VS 100k customer has a lot different.,btohqsg
Their company goal is to enable the employer or parents to give a debit card to domestic helper or children. So that they can transfer money and track their spending.Still rmb last time we used to be able to use Ez link to pay for things? So I think they did nothing wrong and we shouldn‚Äôt angry with them.,btohqsg
Enjoyed it while it last  too bad,btohqsg
They crazy liao. Bring down the only advantages left to their card. Now 100%GG liao.,btohqsg
Where can you find the revolut cashback in the app? I just signed up beginning of the month. Will I be able to see it reflected as well?,btohqsg
I just received my card  oh well,btohqsg
The Cashback will be in the revolut wallet you can find the revolut wallet under your cards section (where you chose which card to use) but don't think you will see it reflected yet,btohqsg
Still ok lah since we doing the Amex -> Grab Pay strategy anyway.,btohqsg
I still haven‚Äôt receive the cashback from instarem .. anyone facing the same? Most of my purchases are through Alibaba  should be eligible for cashback right?,btohqsg
Agree! Chris you have been one of the voices that caused me to be serious about my cpf top ups. Kudos to you!,btohqsg
For webull when they say maintain for 30 days  does it mean that if all the stock I buy goes down below 2000 dollar  I won't be able to get the welcome gift ?,btohqsg
I'm afraid so üôÅ So I always deposit 2100 dollars,btohqsg
No need to deposit more than that I think  mine is dropping but still eligible for the üéÅ,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs ok if u want to be safe and invest more üëç investing is always good anyway üòÇ,btohqsg
As long as you didnt withdraw from your 2000 SGD deposit it's fine.,btohqsg
is there any strategy for getting miles or cashback for travel insurance?,btohqsg
Topup via Highflyer or one of the amex cashback cards into grabpay then use grabpay to pay,btohqsg
Thank you for the reminder. For all those doing Revolut 20% to take note!,btohqsg
Bro can I ask card top up must be in one transaction or can be multiple ones combined reach 300 also?,btohqsg
I see thanks for the reply R and Chris,btohqsg
SSB allotment much lesser than last month,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for Citibank cards (cash back and smrt)  for the minimum monthly spend  do they use calendar month or billing month?,btohqsg
Yea! Do u know how successful applicants will be informed? It‚Äôs my first time applying. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hello.. anyone know what is the best cashback credit card? Currently using UOB one.. sometimes above 2k pending sometimes below 2k spending.. hard to maintain above 2k spending every month. Is HSBC advance better with EGA?,btohqsg
For anyone who want to check how much of of the recent 2022 SSB you are allocatedhttps://eservices.mas.gov.sg/ssb/,btohqsg
Usually use UOB One only for those additional 5% merchants  otherwise no point  so just keep to min $500 spending then the rest can spread between DBS Live Fresh  OCBC Frank  UOB Evol  Maybank Platinum VISA  AMEX Grabpay,btohqsg
Sometimes my spending between 2-3k. Will it be better if I consolidated all my spendings into HSBC advance?,btohqsg
My last 2 months above 2k.. but got only month only 1.6k.,btohqsg
Then UOB give me $100 only,btohqsg
I was thinking HSBC sometimes 2.5% and 3.5% can give me even more.,btohqsg
Thank you so much! So useful! I got most of my allocation  very thankful üôèüèª,btohqsg
Anyone know how long does it take for amaze card to arrived?,btohqsg
Is BigPay considered credit card haha I used it to top up revolut üòÖ,btohqsg
hihiee   thinking of investing CPF   hmmm so which is the best platform currently ah? moneyowl   endowus ? or saxo also can? any good sign up bonus currently?,btohqsg
Check out this video I done earlierhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAB0QUTb70,btohqsg
Next time monitor spending. Any short fall go purchase ntuc vouchers,btohqsg
Good morning! It‚Äôs better to continue with UOB one ah?,btohqsg
I was looking through the YouTube‚Äôs on credit card.. realised about NTUC gift card.,btohqsg
But again  any spending above 2k won‚Äôt entitled for any cashback from UOB one. So normally after reaching 2k  the best plan was to use another card.. but how can we just have one card for all? üòü,btohqsg
Hi all  I bought shoes using citi rewards from new balance via apple pay  but seems I didn‚Äôt get the 10 rewards point  should I use physical card instead next time when shopping?,btohqsg
Check if your transaction will fall under any of the qualified MCCs  if so  write in to support. (In future  hook it up with Instarem :) ),btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ I think new balance should fall under the sport stores but I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I should just use amaze card next time üò¢,btohqsg
You can call in to appeal. They do goodwill on case by case.,btohqsg
Maybe try to ask the bank if can appeal (assuming u bought your new balance shoes at a shoe store or sport store),btohqsg
I‚Äôll try! But thankfully I check my points today  if I wait until end of month I‚Äôll not know this ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Hi  can I still use Amex to top up Shopee and not incur the $1 transaction fee?,btohqsg
Before 1 Aug i believe. Doubt can run cause blanket application from what i remember,btohqsg
Ic cause now it already state $1 apply for credit / debit card top up,btohqsg
Don't take my word for it... I only remember from what I see  stopped using it already after seeing the top-up charge,btohqsg
Are there any benefit topup and use shoppe pay?,btohqsg
Probably just to use their vouchers...,btohqsg
Hi Guys. May i ask  is there any benefit if i pay my SP bills through axs via the grab mastercard?,btohqsg
you benefit via the Grab topup,btohqsg
the 1.5% or 1.7% cashback from your Amex truecashback card  or the UOB Absolute Cashback card,btohqsg
Actually it is 1.5%/1.7% + 1.2%,btohqsg
Grab still rewards points for payment to SP,btohqsg
which I don't think will last long... usually utility bills should be excluded,btohqsg
oh? didn't know u can make direct payment to SP (i use geneco),btohqsg
AXS payments don't qualify for 1.2% cashback (in GrabRewards Points) so... no point using AXS if can make payment directly with GrabPay,btohqsg
yes  you can do so on SP mobile app,btohqsg
quite convenient and earns you extra points,btohqsg
Then pay up front first before it ends,btohqsg
haha yes  I pay my SP bills as soon as they're out,btohqsg
I paid a year ahead üòÜ to meet citipayall,btohqsg
I guess he overpaid thus leaving funds in his SP account.,btohqsg
Hi for the Amaze card  is there any minimum spending in order to get cash back?,btohqsg
to get the $10 sign up bonus can top up grab to fulfil criteria?,btohqsg
But you won't get it instantly   took me a few days,btohqsg
Just follow the steps laid out üëç,btohqsg
Hi. If I don't use grab for traveling  is it still worth it to try for the amex +grab cashback strategy for other grab pay expenses?My monthly expenses about $800 only.,btohqsg
Definitely have better cards like OCBC365.. can't think off my head but surely have better cards for these,btohqsg
Hi All  I've never gotten a Credit Card. So looking into getting one But unsure because there's many CC... Really Confusing. So hoping someone can recommend me one.Most of my stuffs i bought online i top up in Grab and i pay by Grab. So i have tons of points. like 300k+Usually take more MRT and Bus for Travelling. Also i want a card that i can pay anytime for example:Watching Movies  Dinner and Other stuffs Grand total of $300-400. Can i pay it an hour later? Instead of waiting for statement?My Min spend and bills paying is always 1k every month.,btohqsg
I think you can only pay after statement comes out  but I always refer tohttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/to help me decide,btohqsg
So based on your spending behaviour you can match with the cards listed there,btohqsg
The simpler one should be thishttps://www.pzl.sg/blog/which-credit-cards-do-i-have-singapore/,btohqsg
Out of the two Cashback Cards which one would you choose? I realised American Express wrote Topup Grabpay wallet.,btohqsg
For cashback I usually find the simple one like UOB Evol (if u spend 600/month) or OCBC FRANK (if u spend 833/month),btohqsg
If the transaction not eligible for those two cards  I use grabpay + amex,btohqsg
Are these 2 Cards Okay for Grabpay? Like most of the time i will use Grabpay and top up.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt that‚Äôs why use amex to topup grabpay  but if u see the cashback for evol is around 6.7% and frank is 6% so higher,btohqsg
So I don‚Äôt see why you should use grabpay for transaction that eligible for evol or frank cashback,btohqsg
You can use this video to decide toohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saqSEuA-usw,btohqsg
Just sharing information. You can consider using the NS55 Credits in your LifeSG app to perform top-ups to your special / retirement account (if you're 55 and above) under the Retirement Sum Topping-up Scheme.,btohqsg
Use at NS55 at Cold Storage and get $5 discount 9% rebate also not bad.,btohqsg
i just use the NS55 to top up my cpf SA via paynow... inspired by honey money... ü§£,btohqsg
shld have make better use. Example fairprice  frasermall etc have extra %.,btohqsg
NS55 credits can transfer to bank accounthttps://blog.seedly.sg/convert-ns55-credits-cash/,btohqsg
ehh mine still not in leh why ah,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea what combination should I use for heavy monthly insurance payment for both cashback and miles? Amex and grabpay? I was thinking if can combine other cashback or miles reward cards with instarem excluding dbs cards since dbs exclude instarem.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I've watched the Vid. If you were to choose between American Express True Cashback & UOB Absolute AMEX  Which one would you pick? I'm always topping up on GrabPay,btohqsg
the difference is really small  just pick the bank you'd like to deal with (which is quite obvious in my opinion),btohqsg
Amex service is good  I never tried UOB yet,btohqsg
Get amex first for signup reward plus 3% on first $5000,btohqsg
Actually never tried any other banks except dbs/posb.,btohqsg
For gift redemption from moneysmart I already spent $500 within the 30days period. Do I wait for the bank to update moneysmart or it will only be valid after I made the payments? Btw how do I check payments for credit card like the due date.,btohqsg
Quick question: Is it worth it to paywave RM400 (exclusive of conversion fee)?If yes  CB cashback+ or HSBC Revo is a better choice?,btohqsg
Hello peeps any referral code for simply go app?,btohqsg
Why was I charged CCY conversion fee for a transaction in SGD??,btohqsg
Was the item/service/stay u purchased quoted in foreign currency?,btohqsg
oh nvm  I found the explanation,btohqsg
You should have told us its UOB  UOb has a unique fcy definition,btohqsg
Care to uncrop it so we can read context?,btohqsg
I cropped the relevant section just to save others some time ü§£,btohqsg
As i said  its for context,btohqsg
sure  my bad  you may check the link above ü§£,btohqsg
Anw Best to just share with the community what you found: for e.g. citi master card transactions processed outside Singapore or with overseas merchants will be subject to 1% fee‚Ä¶So we all learn togetherThanks julia,btohqsg
Thanks for the summary. I'll take note next time üëå,btohqsg
But why use citi on qgoda?,btohqsg
I was naive....so which card would you recommend?,btohqsg
If agoda sgd i would use DBS WWMC,btohqsg
ah yes  but I just didn't have that card at that time ü§£,btohqsg
I wish I joined this group earlier,btohqsg
what are the difference between Amex Kriflyer and High Flyer card? what are the considerations in choosing?,btohqsg
Main difference are on miles rate and 1 is personal 1 is business card,btohqsg
Would this be a better deal actually?,btohqsg
You would need to compare the prices between Citi x Agoda landing page VS an incognito mode pure Agoda page  then see if the additional miles are worth it. Sometimes  the price difference may surprise you,btohqsg
But I thought we only able to book via the link from citi agoda,btohqsg
Hi. What do y‚Äôall use to pay for utilities and insurance (term plans  investment plans etc)?,btohqsg
That is if you want to get the Citi 7 mpd promo. For some  saving in absolute cost may be the priority,btohqsg
Yea and depends what you are using the miles for: if you are redeeming anything from SQ biz class to suites which is worth anywhere from 2-8 cents per mile (based on milelion)  then the higher price on agoda might be worth it if it costs below the value of your redemption,btohqsg
My intuition is that if savings in absolute costs is of utmost priority  then cash back cards would make more sense than miles,btohqsg

üò° grabpay card for travel insurance got no points,btohqsg
well expected as insurance is usually excluded for rewardsü§£,btohqsg
but you can get cashback from AMEX  which I guess is what Ben meant,btohqsg
Can I ask for credit card payment  is it good idea to pay for credit card bill via AXS with GrabPay to earn 1.7% cashback with UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
I am concerned that the bill will eventually get larger and larger very soon since next month you still need to pay back the whole amount and it will eat up the $30000 grab pay limit very soon,btohqsg
say every month you spend 2k  after 5 months 2+4+6+8+10 = 30k you already hit the limit...,btohqsg
Btw  grab 30k limit is based on calendar year  while wise and revolut are rolling based. So can plan the limit better.,btohqsg
I was trying to search for a grabpay alternative which can accept either amex or diners club and also come with a mastercard or visa card to spend with... But sadly no another app can do this in singapore.,btohqsg
Oh I nvr thought about this  what if we just pay cc bills via AXS using grabpay that is topped up via paynow? At least can get grab points,btohqsg
Hello do you guys know if it‚Äôs ok to apply or hold too many credit cards at one ? Applying them within a short span from one another really affect credit score ?,btohqsg
as long as you can get approved and always pay your bills in time  it should be fine,btohqsg
Can anyone share their cashback credit card stack? üòÖ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think grab give you points for credit card payment tho. Do they?,btohqsg

Stashaway boasts 1.4 % or sthg but my own calculation is still abt 1.2%LolsEndowus is negative 10%,btohqsg
and endowus is their cash smart?,btohqsg
No endowus for me has two partsCash is cash smart in negativeSrs is portfolio core  moderate risk,btohqsg
The cash smart is single digit negativeThe srs portfolio core is double digit negativeSo my impression of endowus is going down lolsVsStashaway consistly single digit positive,btohqsg
Sigh so much for first venture into roboadvisors,btohqsg
Think endowus cash holds longer term instruments which were negatively affected by interest rate hike. Their core is in line with the rest of the market,btohqsg
Grabpay > Jipay still can earn grab points now right?,btohqsg
I read throughhttps://www.jipay.app/reward  so 1st aug totally cannot use grab card to top up alr?,btohqsg
Don't waste time with jibai card after that. Just withdraw everything and put aside,btohqsg
I just apply then all this shit... card haven even reach,btohqsg
top up to ezlink/revolut hahaha  i got $0.48 stuck in jipay app but i dont bother alr cos minimum top up $25,btohqsg
They didn't stop u to top up in aug. Just pay fee,btohqsg
Basically this jipay no longer useful for ppl who wanna stack the reward. It is really for domestic workers use.,btohqsg
Think maybe their investor not further investing or what. Cannot burn money already.,btohqsg

Try Withdraw from CIMB/Maybank ATM via Revolut Card  up to SGD 350 a month,btohqsg
Any atm charges for these 2 bank?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre using it to pay legit bills on your other cards (and assuming they‚Äôre all miles cards) its an excellent idea as you‚Äôll be getting your cashback on top of miles.Even if you dont do that but do it the way u described  i see it as maximising the benefits that the gpmc gives you. Either way its a fantastic deal,btohqsg
Yes I agree. Just the 30k limit from grab is really not enough if use it to pay bills,btohqsg
And after this no more grab 1.2% or 2.0% also,btohqsg
And may I ask if I use the amex card to pay for a friend  and the friend pay me back with paynow or bank transfer  would that be a problem? Since it may generate some incoming cashflow beyond what I declared in my income tax...,btohqsg
Is Atome considered online payment in DBS livefresh/OCBC Frank/UOB EVOL?,btohqsg

Anyone having issue with paying 3x10SGD transaction with Revolut for NTUC voucher and didn‚Äôt get referral rewards?,btohqsg
Mine works  need to wait 1-2 business day to process. So long as the 3 purchase is done before the campaigns  they will still award after the event ends.,btohqsg
Also you can wait for better events like $100 per referral  referring $60 abit waste haha imo,btohqsg
The 1% fee is charged by the bank  right? So to avoid this fee  I should pay with AMAZE card? Or if it's charged by Airbnb itself  then I have to switch to host region and pay in host currency,btohqsg
Hi all  today Aug‚Äôs SSBs will be issued. As it‚Äôs my first time  any idea what can I expect and what‚Äôre any next steps? Thanks!,btohqsg

Yes. Maybe that works. I read online that Airbnb do charge up to 3%  although it was not reflected on the invoice.The extra fees comes after. So Amaze card might solve the extra 1% fee.,btohqsg
I guess we read the same article..but I just checked yesterday  for a random stay  the price is SGD is exactly at the Google rate without that 3% surcharge,btohqsg
So it seems that best solution is to use AMAZE + Citi Cashback Plus / UOB Lady's card,btohqsg
*this is just my conclusion  I might be wrong,btohqsg
Seems touch and go top up MCC is 4784  anyone tried to stack this with Citi Rewards+Amaze?,btohqsg

I am surprised because Revolut metal actually give 1% cash back for topping up TnG,btohqsg

Rather than the lousy bank returns,btohqsg
Wa u sub to the metal card uh?I thought there's no exclusions for cashback on the 1% if metal,btohqsg
The cashback is cap at the monthly fee. Don't see the benefit to subscribe,btohqsg
They say some exclusion in TnC. Just try lah can get full refund if don‚Äôt order card and unsubscribe.,btohqsg
But dbs multiplier alr 3.5% ü§î,btohqsg
I unfortunately can‚Äôt meet all the criteria to hit that amount :),btohqsg
Just wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to buy insurance + investment from them (as I alr have dbs cc),btohqsg
Investment need to hit $1K monthly to fulfill that criteria,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ maybe I should consider to put stashaway money to dbs robo invest ü§î,btohqsg

Otherwise I‚Äôll have moomoo  tiger  and webull + ibkr,btohqsg
I still keep the app for real time stock price monitoring tho,btohqsg
Same  I am thinking of cashing out because how new these broker are. I scare that once those crypto app start to collapse the broker app might be next.,btohqsg
Plus got too much account open,btohqsg
i took out my deposits immediately after i got my free shares. will probably sell my free shares soon too and cash them out. dont think moo moo  tiger and the likes will collapse like the crypto platform as they work differently  but i still dont trust these chinese companies.,btohqsg
I tried topping up $50 Grabpay with UOB absolute Amex 1.7%  then topping up JiPay $50 with Grabpay to earn Grabpoints  then topping up Grabpay $50 with JiPay card and the $50 is able to be withdrawn back to bank! Probably a glitch haha,btohqsg
Don't concentrate too much on ibkr as well. When market volatility sometimes individuals broker fail to work. You can still hedge it with other broker,btohqsg
It better to have multiple broker.,btohqsg

Isit wrong to overpay loan amount ?Will I be charged for early payment.Currently I have this loan 4 months left but I have the cash .But if I closed the loans have to pay $150..Or shall I just over pay the full amount and wait 4 monthsAny advice in the this ?,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs better to check with your bank. Am aware some bank don‚Äôt have pre payment penalty but some have. Also it depends on the kind of loan T & Cs applicable to you.,btohqsg
If there is pre penalty  then you have to compare the interest savings vs the 150. If interest savings is more than 150 then paying off in advance makes sense.,btohqsg
