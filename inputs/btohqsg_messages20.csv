Bit of a shame. It was a nice green area,btohqsg
Just to have a better gauge. Any one have any idea how much income (before CPF) must we show in order to get abt $350k loan?,btohqsg
U apply HFE already they can calculate for u,btohqsg
My last time HLE loan my wife and my income combine 7KMax loan up to $480KBefore my wife become PR  my ownself 1 person only loan max is $290K.So i believe if u need $350K load combine income likely need around  $5K-6K,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MonthlyInstallment/MonthlyInstallmentCalculate$1588 monthly OA (23%)But they cannot deduct everything. Need to keep some for something like death insurance. And as you age  the cpf contribution gets lesser.So to be safe $2000 monthly OA (23%)Your salary must be $8695 (100%) so to be safe about $9000 and more. Tbh is not easy to loan that much. Mine earning is about $7000 also less than 300k loan.,btohqsg
Wah we about the same but my loan was less than 300k,btohqsg
Depends on how old u are and also how much cpf u have along the yrs . Because if me alone with $290K without my wife i also still can get the 4rm hdb non mature areas . Because I already not young anymore and my cpf alone also can pay for downpayment and monthly installments,btohqsg
My wife become PR then hdb calculate my wife income in as co owner. So likely i no need loan max 20 yrs. Just loan for 15-16 yrs,btohqsg
just loan 20 yr then change after that lor,btohqsg
u wont be able to tell the future,btohqsg
20 yr loan interest quite high. If 20 yrs and I'm just 20+ yrs old im ok to loan 20 yrs maybe 40+ done.If im 33 already wait for bto keys come 36 20 yrs after is 56 wa too old liao,btohqsg
Just take the max loan first then if can prepay back also no penalty right?,btohqsg
if anyone has feedback on this feel free to pm me!,btohqsg
Will there be bto at the former faŕrer park stadium   former cambridge sch 1 n 2    former pek kio cc land?,btohqsg
Only will know when HDB announce upcoming plots,btohqsg
can google for ura singapore to see what govt has planned for it in the next 10 years  but subject to changes also. if it’s residential  then could be bto or condo  only hdb will know,btohqsg
No penalty but ur monthly payment is same locked,btohqsg
But you clear ur accrued interest faster,btohqsg
How much money should me and my partner have in our cpf to bid for a 4 room flat? We just started working only,btohqsg
I lay out the payments you need to do on your first  second and third appointment.First Appointment: Option fee 1-2k cash via NETS depending on your room type.Second Appointment: 5% of your unit price if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 10% of your unit price.Buyer stamp duty (low 10k to high 10k  near 20k)HDB conveyancing fees (few hundred dollars)If you are taking bank loan  10% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 20% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash + BSD and HDB conveyancing fees + lawyer legal fees ($2.5k-3k)Third appointment: remaining 15% if under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise remaining 10% plus  the other fees stated below,btohqsg
So for now you need to have enough to cover the first and second appointments,btohqsg
XY laid it out very nicely  but I just wanna add that apart from the dp and other fees  you just need to ensure that you have enough for loan (if using CPF) by the time of key collection (when loan payment starts),btohqsg
Simple as it is depending on your location of bto.If you are conversative kind go for lower price unit or you are confident enough just select the unit of your choice within your budget.,btohqsg
Every fee laid out here is using CPF OA except option fee via NETS?,btohqsg
You can choose to pay in cash but yes with the exception of the option fee  the downpayment  HDB conveyance fees and stamp duty fees can use OA to pay.As for the 3rd appointment  the remaining downpayment can use OA. Not too sure about the other fees as I’ve not made it past there yet 😅,btohqsg
So second appt need to pay stamp duty in cash already???,btohqsg
Like can be 20k extra in cash? I thought option fee only in cash + 10% from cpf,btohqsg
Your cpf not enough then cash . Yes stamp duty need to pay already,btohqsg
Yep stamp duty but you can choose CPF or cash,btohqsg
Btw for those with grants  the grants can only cover the downpayment part  any other fees have to be paid from you using CPF/cash,btohqsg
Oct 2023 results are out :),btohqsg
Do note that from this launch onwards  these are the changes in rules:- if you get a queue number within supply  you cannot apply for future launches until after your selection appt- if you're out of supply  can apply for future launches  but if you get a selection appt  future applications will be cancelled AND if you reject then  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year (exception if there are 10 or fewer flats by your selection appointment; 5 for SBF)- once you reject once  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year,btohqsg
The 'Long Island' Project how do you guys think will affect the Bayshore BTO demand,btohqsg
I think Bayshore demand will already be sky high without factoring this in. I view the long island project as positive so I can imagine that demand will only be higher with this,btohqsg
True2 but form seaside residence become reservoir side residence hahha,btohqsg
That's true too! Didn't think of it like this,btohqsg
It'll be the first public housing in that area for ages and ages  I wonder how high the application rate (And the price 😂) will be,btohqsg
Hi is there a link to Queenstown Nov 2023 bto chat?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone know where can we view the floor plan of the houses?,btohqsg
It’s not released by HDB yet. You can join the telegram group here first:https://t.me/KallangWhampoaSept23,btohqsg
How to check number of drop out for bto?Thank you,btohqsg
U can't check. Only when selection time then u can check dailyMeaning per day 10q number to be called but if that day the unit gone is 8 means 2 dropped out lor,btohqsg
U get what i mean ?Example last Q of the day number 10U login to hdb and check take up rate is 8 means 2 never go la,btohqsg
Ok noted thank youLast time saw a live table from other groupShow the number of drop outOn the first day over 100 drop out,btohqsg
And prediction that dropped out rate will be super low because of the new rule.  if never select once get invited  u dropped to 2nd timer for 1yr,btohqsg
So don't expect dropped out rate to be high,btohqsg
anybody knows if hdb is releasing sale of balance ?,btohqsg
That one...1. That's on a project to project basis - every day they track the number of units taken compared against the number of appointments that day2. That's tracked by volunteers. Ultimately a community effort because last queue number can only be seen by those with appointmentsJust FYI! You can also start that for the HDB launch you applied for :),btohqsg
But what's the benefit of tracking such stats for other than those booking the flats?,btohqsg
Probably… can see when ppl start dropping out so the people at the back have more units to choose from I guess,btohqsg
End of the day u can track your self too.Just log in and see,btohqsg
Anybody knows if approved HFE can be revised again?Eg. Applied HFE in 2022 as employed. Unemployed in 2023. Will HFE be revised in this situation?,btohqsg
But rmbr income go up  EHG go down,btohqsg
As long as you don't revise ur old valid HFE still used,btohqsg
I wonder how long the Long Island project will take… 30 to 50 years?,btohqsg

Yes. Just got ballot QHLE applied in Nov 2022HFE applied in Mar~May 2023,btohqsg
There was news about the validity of HFE being extended recently but i cannot remember effective from which monthAnyway  your March / May HFE  already unemployed?And your ballot Q is for which BTO exercise? 2022?,btohqsg

Hi  May I know the per day HDB hub selection Q for BTO flat for individual estate.. is it 10 Q number each day or….tks. 😎,btohqsg
No fixed number so it's very hard to say. Generally at the start of selection period there will be very few per day  then over time it will scale up,btohqsg
Could go from 2 per day to sth like 8-14,btohqsg
You can check out BTO appointment tracker  the owner  SM  tracks past projects where possible (if ppl submit data),btohqsg
Tks for your info! Much appreciated..😎,btohqsg
Morning folks! Wanted to check:The red part I circled  anyone knows if HDB typically designs it to be covered by a full wall? Or will they do a half wall instead?,btohqsg
hello any chat group for the upcoming woodlands bto?,btohqsg
check w hdb. because what you circle is part of the corridor. i doubt they will do half wall since nearby to it is refuse chute.which project is this  if you don't mind sharing?,btohqsg
Yeah going to ask the HDB appointment officer. Will the desk officer know though? 🤔Project is Serangoon North Vista!,btohqsg

Hi anyone know how to see the subscription rate for BTOs?,btohqsg
Are FEB 2024 BTOs still using the mature/non-mature categories or move on to the new standard/plus/prime categorisation??,btohqsg
HDB site isn't helpful at defining when exactly is 2H2024  as the new framework will be implemented then 🤷‍♀🤦‍♀,btohqsg
Isn't It from Aug 2024 bto onwards?,btohqsg
Is either u wait for the feb launch to get more details,btohqsg
Or wait for more details to come out,btohqsg
Dec 2023 sales launch out liao,btohqsg
second half means after June innit  since june is the half way month of the yearand after june means aug 2024 bto applications onwardsseems quite intuitive to me 🤔,btohqsg
how would one intuitively know 2H2024 means 2nd half of 2024? it's usually noted as Q3/Q4 2024 😒,btohqsg
as in  u didn’t know the H stands for half izzit,btohqsg
some articles that i read say second half haha not 2H eg mynicehomehdb says second half,btohqsg
So is the new scheme good or bad ?,btohqsg
I believe  is the project that matters,btohqsg
2H2024 is literally 2nd half of 2024.. it's their logic not ours lol 🤭,btohqsg
Anyway the project mention not out still 2nd half of 2024,btohqsg
New scheme lesser ppl apply ?,btohqsg
hmm new scheme lesser ppl eh... but some ppl will still prefer to bto 🧐,btohqsg
Mop 10 year for some is very long,btohqsg
nah. i asked coz if the new scheme starts for 2024 BTO (first one is in Feb)  i'll skip the current one and aim for that la,btohqsg
the first plus flat should be in superb location  maybe just right outside Bishan  Punggol  Jurong East or Tampines MRT?back then first plh river peak also very good,btohqsg
"hello we are students applying now on the portal. we have 2 questions1. under ""Deferred Assessment"" section  there's no option for currently on full time studies. there's only options for recently completed studies or NS. do we have to pick the completed studies option here?2. is the first timers priority automatically applied? under the ""Eligible Priority Schemes"" section it says not eligible for any priority schemes.",btohqsg
New scheme only start in Q2 2024. If follow the standard launch month  it will be in May 2024.,btohqsg
CuriousCan a 50yr old buy a resale 2 room flexi reaching mop ?,btohqsg
true. however 10Y MOP got more subsidy w their tighter restrictions. plus & prime— there are perks to it like better amenities  easier to commute to work.. at the end of the day  the choice is yours 🫢,btohqsg
hi guys  can i check  when will i know how many ballot chances that i will have?my kid currently is SC  but during HFE letter approval  she was stateless.do i need to request to update the HFE letter before applying BTO ?,btohqsg
Hi! May i know how can we qualify for FT(PMC) scheme? Do we need to change our marital status in the HFE letter as Married?,btohqsg
The woodlands new bto near woodland mrt won't be damm noisy?,btohqsg
Currently the Dec BTO and supposing Jan SBF is separated. Would we be considered second timer if we got better location and number during Jan's SBF launch and choose to give up Dec BTO?,btohqsg
Can I ask build time for Sinming is 32 months then how come TOP date for sinming 2027 June..??,btohqsg
it is computed from the median month of the flat selection period (median of march to dec 2024). assuming 32 months (2 years 8 months) from Aug 2024 (since aug is the midway point of march and dec)  that is April 2027. then hdb round to the nearest quarter  april and june is 2Q2027  so i guess they just round it later to june,btohqsg
do we need to apply for First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples) during application for bto ? on my screen only have MCPS but my kid still baby...,btohqsg
correct la.. if get ballot number  selection starts in 2024.. 32 mths is 2 years 8 mths..,btohqsg
I guess you have to wait until they update your application status after you have submitted.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Tanah Merah bto ended their selection already ?,btohqsg
Hi! I cant really rmb the exact details but (i was still a ft student during the application) during submission we submitted supporting documents like student certification letter/student status letter/ photo of student card as proof of student status,btohqsg
1. Has been answered by@murniayum  students are indeed part of DIA but not sure how it looks for HFE application now compared to HLE2. First timer priority is automatically applied yes,btohqsg
thanks very much both! I submitted the application since i think deferred income assessment not considered in the application anyways. will just inform hdb once we get to that stage 🤞,btohqsg
Based on our experience  the HDB officer will call/email if they need more documents/clarification,btohqsg
AskThis Dec bto can we submit first then remove our submition before 11dec if we change mind,btohqsg
I believe you should be able to cancel but won't get $10 back. Can I ask why not submit on the last day instead? It's not first come first serve,btohqsg
Oh no matter right if submit day 1 or last day on Dec 11,btohqsg
Yes. So you can wait til you've decided  to apply,btohqsg
So no need to rush! Just submit before the end timing  like don't do it at 11pm that night haha,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone has other contact number that i can call to HDB regarding HFE application status? the usual service line seems not to work😓 thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Guys can I ask what exactly does application rate mean? I saw the definition on the Website but it doesn't make sense when I calculate myself?,btohqsg
"Hi  when you say ""what exactly does application mean"" what part of the application are you unsure of?",btohqsg
This is roughly how the calculation works using Bukit panjang 4rm as example,btohqsg
Ahh OK that's why it didn't tally off it  missed your first step,btohqsg
So to keep it simple lower than 1 means can get  above 1 and higher the number means more worst 😅,btohqsg
Yes  essentially! The higher the application rate the lower the chances of you getting a queue number are. If the overall application rate (1st + 2nd timer) is at 1 or below  then everyone will get a queue number within supply. If 1st timer application rate is 0.95 / 0.85 (depending on flat type) then all 1st timers will get a queue number within supply,btohqsg
Hi guy   can I check with you guy I’m Singaporean   my wife currently waiting for her PR approval so can I apply HFE now or wait until PR approve ? Appreciate guy 🙏🙏,btohqsg

Please check on the levy to pay when apply with pr too,btohqsg
hi all  can i ask if i apply for dec 2023 bto  can i still apply for the next bto or sobf?,btohqsg
I have call to HDB hotline to confirm  as long as your queue no are out of the supply units you can apply for next BTO.,btohqsg
@peanutaidenmumyes you should be able to  but the next SBF will be in 2024  I'm not sure what the rules are for if the results for Dec 2023 launch haven't come out,btohqsg
I got my queue no xxx for queenstown Tanglin Halt BTO Oct 2023 & slightly of of the supply unit  I will still trying my luck for Dec'23 BTO.,btohqsg
not in Jan 2024 dear.. there are some areas for SBF 2023 unit selection are yet to clear ya.. punggol & queenstown are one of those ✌🏼,btohqsg
I understand that  but shumeiz was asking about applying for the next SBF / bto launch  which is why I said Jan 2024 is the next SBF launch 😄,btohqsg
hmm how sure are you that it's Jan 2024 when HDB is not even being specific on the recent press.,btohqsg
Another grp mentioned next SBF wont be in Jan 24.,btohqsg
i think the next exercise will be minimum Feb. cuz the Dec press release said to submit HFE application by 15 Jan to participate in the next BTO. if the SBF is earlier than that they would've highlighted it,btohqsg
yes it wont be in Jan 2024 cos like what i've said.. some SBF 2023 unit selection for some areas are not cleared.. and if you're free enough to scroll  even Tengah have yet to clear.,btohqsg
Thanks for highlighting everyone  I went back and looked at past messages as I got that impression from past messages  but I did see that articles just said 2024,btohqsg
Does SBF selection need to be over before the next SBF launches? Before late 2023 it was always twice a year in May and Nov  not sure that they would clear all the sbf before the next one launches,btohqsg
I thought those left over from sbf will just go to open booking? Nothing to do with upcoming sbf?,btohqsg
Not too sure about that  does@smchuaor anyone know about this?I was stating it this way as Nå was implying that the previous SBF needs to be cleared before the next SBF can be launched,btohqsg
So I feel they will carry on their SBF as usual and any left over for may one will go to Open booking. Else open booking no flats to sell. 😂,btohqsg
ya... my guess is that HDB have teething issue that's why the delay. the ballot number result was the main delay. it could have been in July but delayed to late Aug 2023.and i meant SBF 2023.,btohqsg
just hope that HDB don't delay-delay ✌🏼,btohqsg
Got official telegram group for plantation edge?,btohqsg

does anyone know what's the application rate cutoff for guaranteed unit allocation? is it still at 1.7?,btohqsg

oh shag that’s actl quite low,btohqsg
Btw anyone changed the BtO bedroom windows to double glazed,btohqsg
Anyone knows how does MGPS works when you get a queue number I understand that there a pre identified flats but is that for only the 3room? Or all types is pre identified,btohqsg
"""The replacement of full height windows is strictly not allowed. Permission may be granted in an instance where a damaged frame requires a complete replacement.""",btohqsg
The HDB website says full height windows include 3/4 height and bay windows.. not sure ur bedroom is what window but I think BTOs nowadays not allowed to change,btohqsg
Sorry.... may I know what does the term temporary loan means....does it mean HLE 🙏🙏,btohqsg
there are pre allocated flats for all room types if you’re from mgps,btohqsg
Oh then how to improve in noise cancelling from outside,btohqsg
What noise are you referring to?,btohqsg
Just do a Google search u will find ur answer.. don't think I can advertise products here but there is a company which does retrofit double glazing using magnet with acrylic panes,btohqsg
you may consider using black out curtains though it's not 100% noise cancelling proof,btohqsg
Question - how early should I start looking at renovations for my home?,btohqsg
Disclaimer : not an ID/contractor but have contacts in the industry (sharing based on what i know  so maybe someone else with more experience can chime in too?)- 1 year before  for you to research  do up mood board  budget setting etc (some people do start later but would be good that you have some ideas before meeting your id for a more productive session)- 6 months before key collection  can start shopping around for your id/contractor (minimally 2 appt with each as 1st appt is sharing your vision  2nd appt quotes etc)- 1 month before hopefully you have firmed up the id/contractor by then (permits  sourcing of materials etc) *- key collection > defects check > repairs by hdb > reno starts* especially if you want to shop on taobao  better to plan ahead and buy early so that everything arrives on time (if there is issue with measurements — ie kitchen sink smaller than expected  it can still be rectified)Also your id can also help you in suggesting which pieces would flow better with your themeHope this helps!,btohqsg
any ID or contractor to recommend?,btohqsg
just want a simple setup - kitchen cabinet and water and electiric and aircon and washing machine setting upflooring will ask hdb to OCS? for a 2room flexi with 20k enough?,btohqsg
Pricing wise im not sure 😅  i have a few friends in the industry  if you are keen  can pm me for their contact.You can look into those bto promo from id / contracts firms.If you want to keep it low  can also consider those off the shelf like ikea kitchen set.,btohqsg
Anastasia Tan:Hello u need Id recommenddationI can recommend uThe id did my mum houseNext mth he's doing up my hse,btohqsg

Hi guys can I ask if we cancel our bto application  is it immediate or it takes sometime to cancel? I want to redo my application  missed out some scheme to include,btohqsg
if You Have Signed The Lease Agreement At this stage  if you choose to cancel your BTO application  the cost would be higher.You would forfeit 5% of the purchase price. While the legal fees paid are non-refundable  you may apply to IRAS to refund the stamp duty via HDB or your solicitor.7 Jun 2023,btohqsg

If you need to cancel your application  please use our e-feedback form.15 Jul 2022https://www.hdb.gov.sg› residentialChanges and Cancellation - HDB,btohqsg
pls use the link i pass u,btohqsg
u ask them feedbacks see what them give u ans,btohqsg
remember once u cancelled the bto hdb to selected u be immediate block to 1 year come not alloe to book any unit ...,btohqsg
as this hdb is give u a lesson no play play last year 2022-23 many bw cancel them selected..so hdb get angry .thia the way to stop ✋️. doing this,btohqsg
Hi Fareez  it's best you call HDB first thing tmr to check  they are the best ppl to advise you if you can resubmit immediately,btohqsg
Always hard to go thru hahah kena wait till closing time but will try this time first caller HAHHAH,btohqsg
Wna do MGPS in the application also  any others that know more about MGPS,btohqsg
Ah yeah especially this period...all the best!,btohqsg
What specifically about MGPS? Some specific queries might be easier for others to answer :),btohqsg
I knw it's from pre identified flats  but is it a must to be the same block and floor etc?,btohqsg
Also MGPS does the parent apply or the child?,btohqsg
they will provide both parent and child list of flats to choose from (they may not necessarily be same block or floor),btohqsg
From the HDB website: Parents (including widowed or divorced parents) must submit a joint application with their married child.,btohqsg
if first timer units are undersubscribed  will the excess units flow to second timer?,btohqsg
there are no first timer or second timer units. if u got a queue number  then its all accounted for alr,btohqsg
unless you’re talking abt at the application stage. 95% reserved for first timer and 5% reserved for second timer.eg: 100 units  so 95 units reserved for first timer and 5 units reserved for second timer. there are no specific units reserved  it’s like in general  5 second timers will get a unit and 95 first timers will get a unitso the queue number can go up to 95x3 + 15x3=330 (i think),btohqsg
in the case of 100 units  if there are 20 first timers and 80 second timer applicants  will all the second timers still get a queue number? or will the excess slots for first timers flow to sbf,btohqsg
no for the first part  yes for the second,btohqsg
like i said only 5 units reserved for second timers  so 20 first timers will cfm get a queue number  and only 15 out of the 80 second timers will get a queue number,btohqsg
so there would be 35 queue numbers in total  and the remaining 65 will go to sbf,btohqsg
i see  where do you see this,btohqsg
i can't find any official information online,btohqsg
yea i think there isn’t official info haha  but got some bits of info here and there in bto chats,btohqsg
then again  if the take up rate is too low  i also dk if hdb will cancel the project or not hahah,btohqsg
i may be wrong too 😅 just gathering info from everywhere haha  better to cfm with hdb directly if this situation affects u!,btohqsg
I hv a friend as a second timers apply for Feb 2023 BTO for Kallang Whampoa (Farrer Park Fields / Rajah Summit) & can get the queue no 3xx  very lucky. ( Total no of application 6857 received),btohqsg
One more person which I know also (First timers) apply for Feb 2023 BTO for Kallang Whampoa (Farrer Park Fields / Rajah Summit) & queue no 9xx.,btohqsg
Hi anybody has been notified on the date to select the BTO for  parc meadow and plantation verge?,btohqsg
Question....If i applied for BTO Aug 2023  got queue number  800+ out of 500+ unit.Havent book flat or anything.If i apply for BTO Dec 2023  i am consider 1st timer or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
First timer more referring to you did not receive housing subsidy before,btohqsg
@DerekChuawythe Aug launch you're saying was launched in Oct right? In that case do see these rules^you will still be considered a 1st timer when applying for Dec launch but if you get a selection appt for the Oct launch  future applications will be cancelled,btohqsg
Can anyone assist me In my situation?I bought a brand new 4 room flat in 1994 sold in 2000 bought a resales 5 room and sold in 2013 and downgrade to a 3 room flat. 1st and 2nd all using HDB loan and currently mine 3 room is fully paid by CpF. Can I still apply for BTO?,btohqsg
I think best you check with HDB. You should be eligible to apply as a second timer but HDB might not loan to you.,btohqsg
One of my colleague told me that he will not buy his second BTO  becuase his first BTO was sold before 2006  HDB said that need to pay for 22.5% for re-sale lavy if he buying second BTO. Better ask HDB.,btohqsg
if bought after 2006  it's a fixed amount,btohqsg
Subsidised flat sold on or after 3 March 2006  its a fixed amount.,btohqsg
Hi so sorry just want to ask if we are still students applying for this and having a reassessment of HFE later  do we put this as taking loan from FI or not taking loan?,btohqsg
not taking loan means not taking loan at all for this bto,btohqsg
ah i see what abt the deferred income thing,btohqsg
yeah when i applied there was no option also for it. I just selected whatever as it says you can still change when signing agreement,btohqsg
Yeap but my first was sold in 2000,btohqsg
deferred income is automatically applied if you’re eligible. don’t need to apply for it. if you’re not eligible then u can’t do anything abt it,btohqsg
Hi i just realised that my current location is within 4km of the area but in the application i applied as not within 4km what do i do now? is there a way i can alter it?,btohqsg
You applying for Dec? If yes tmr call HDB ask them help you amend,btohqsg
yeap! okk thank u i will ask them tmr,btohqsg
i have another question - anyone here planning only to do the kitchen and retain the original fittings?(my BTO no opt out of OCs  hence thinking of only doing kitchen),btohqsg
hi guys  if i were to buy resale before cancelling my Oct2023  ballot and before flat selection appointment  am i still counted as first timer and eligible for first timer resale grant?,btohqsg
i do and its within supply,btohqsg
i did but it only mentioned BTO restriction  im not interested in BTO anymore,btohqsg
so even if i cancel my BTO id still be consider as first timer core applicant for resale if i hit all the criteria?,btohqsg
"this is an interesting question. don't take my word for it  but i believe you'd still be eligible for first timer resale grant  as the sole criteria for eligibility for resale grants is whether or not you have been subsidised before (this page  under ""household status"").as such  assuming you've never bought a BTO/SBF  nor a resale using grant  i believe you're eligible.i doubt the oct 2023 restrictions on non-selection are relevant to you  since 1.2(e) inoct 2023's conditions for purchase documentonly says that those who reject ""will not enjoy the following when they apply for a flat in any HDB sales exercise within the said period"". you'd be applying for a resale flat  not taking part in BTO/SBF exercise.",btohqsg
hey  thanks for replying  thats really helpful and informative!,btohqsg
np! i reiterate to not take my word for it though haha  i'm guessing myself too 😅,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know the main contractor for Ulu Pandan Glades?,btohqsg
Hi all  some people have been asking about this! Someone on another bto chat asked :) name hidden for privacy,btohqsg
Yo friends and future neighbours  i just called HDB to ask about this. The service executive clarified that the 95% quota reserved for first timers will be fixed. So the excess flatswill notgo to the second timers. Instead  they will go to SBF.,btohqsg
Admin pls do something about this thanks.,btohqsg
Deleted and banned! Thanks for alerting,btohqsg
No problem it is our responsibility to keep this group free of nonsense.,btohqsg
Thanks for helping to ask! But there's one more question: will they still issue queue numbers beyond the flat supply for the second timers who did not successfully get a Q within the flat supply (the 5% units)?If so then might be possible still for second timers to get the chance to select a flat.,btohqsg
eg: 100 units  so 95 units reserved for first timer and 5 units reserved for second timer.since hdb allocates up to 300% of supply so the queue number can go up to 95x3 + 5x3 =330 (i think),btohqsg
Hey  it wasn't me who asked  I hid their name for privacy purposes!But yes still queue numbers given for 300% of flat supply,btohqsg
I see! That's good to hear. Thanks!,btohqsg
I recall reading that BTO only starts construction if demand exceeds 70 percent of the project. Does that mean that the Dec 2023 Queenstown (Ulu Pandan) and Bukit Merah (Alexandra) are at risk of getting cancelled? Does anyone know of any similar precedent?,btohqsg
It won't be cancelled because what u read is long ago policy,btohqsg
In 2022 they already ans this,btohqsg
Those unsold units will be pushed to sbf or obf,btohqsg
SBF and then if still have remaining to OBF,btohqsg
I think you just submit all your income statements. Should be able to get some grant…,btohqsg
If got constant CPF contribution then will have grant. Do your HLE first,btohqsg
As long as u summited what is needed then no issue.,btohqsg
Just Share  send by a friend.,btohqsg
Just Share  send by a friend.,btohqsg
Just Share  send by a friend.,btohqsg
So total how much flat supply is there? 2016?,btohqsg
Starting is correct.639 first timers are guaranteed a number within supply.33 second timers are guaranteed a number within supply.HDB gives up to 300% of available units. Aka 672 x 3 = 2016 (naturally 672 within supply)Assuming there are less than 2016 total applications  everyone will receive a queue number.If they are more than 2016 applications  there will be people who don't receive a queue number at all.if there are more than 639 first timers  the rest will get a number outside of supply. Same for 2nd timer number.Hope this explains,btohqsg
Actually this is the full message thatSebastianandLam890are sharing a screenshot of,btohqsg
In this scenario there are 672 units,btohqsg
Hi  first timer BTO applicant here  just curious about this. So if queue numbers amounting to 300% of the number of units are issued  does it mean that I could get a queue number but it's so far behind that I won't get any units to choose from?,btohqsg
Yes  also there is also possibility that even you are within the supply but the ethnic quota run out,btohqsg
Over subscribed LoR like the Dec woodland bto,btohqsg
Regarding this pls see the below. Theoretically ethnic quota should not run out within supply,btohqsg
"responding to this  and@papa_smurfy's taghaha. sorry for the late reply!in theorytheoretically  ethnic quota can run out when queue numbers are still within supply. after all  think about this hypothetical scenario: there are 100 flats  with 25 slots for M/I/O. if fewer than 25 M/I/O apply  there's no way that we can have all the M/I/O slots filled. so a C applicant whose queue number is within supply  is not guaranteed of a flat.in practicethat said for BTO  ethnic quota has never run out while within supply.so it has long been suspected that (1) EIP proportions are already applied during the balloting stage for those within supply  and (2) there has always been enough applicants from each ethnicity to 'fill up' these within-supply slots.S/N 2 is an important point because it implies that if this criteria is not met  ethnic quota may run out within supply - just that it hasn't happened yet. so while@DuNn0wHyis right thatethnic quota has never run out technicallywe can't apply this to future projects and say that it will ""never run out"". it's also why theblogsites that @raynertanxw mentionedare not wrong when they say that ethnic quota still applies within supply.HDB's responsegiven that HDB has never been explicit about the above in any of their public comms  i initially thought they would never officially commit to saying anything about it. so i'm actually quite surprised that they actually saidwhat they said to you @raynertanxwhaha. i guess this means that specifically for Rail Green I/II 4R  the above two criteria were met.what we can't say anything about  is whether these criteria were met for the other flat types of Rail Green I/II  and/or other past/ongoing projects. like i mentioned  HDB has never been explicit about this  and hence the officer who replied to@raynertanxwprobably crafted his email carefully with this in mind.what this means for uslike i always say  past patterns don't foretell future events - they can only be used as a gauge. but if one finds comfort seeking some level of certainty in historical data  then as a rule of thumbif you're within supply for BTO  there's no need to worry.read more here  under FAQ #3.",btohqsg
I feel it might be a rather rare case but I actually saw it occur so ymmv,btohqsg
Hello  how to check if I’m under MCPS or public scheme ?,btohqsg
You should be able to know through your invitation package when you get your selection appt - if you see the documents require your parents' IC  then your queue number is through MCPS,btohqsg
Am I able to opt out of the MCPS during selection?,btohqsg
I'm not sure about this  if anyone has experience do share! If not  best to check with HDB about thisBut my 2 cents: I would guess cannot  as your ballot result might have been due to the MCPS extra ballot chance.,btohqsg
Got one article on a couple who managed to opt out of MCPS previously (8 years ago though)https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/queue-numbers-of-applicants-who-withdraw-from-hdb-priority-schemes-will-be-re,btohqsg
Wow that's very interesting  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
Think that's a fair system if it's still in place,btohqsg
Actually if the parents just keep quiet and don't say anything  will hdb be so free to go check whether the parents got stay there?,btohqsg
Oh ok nvm I know already. Silly qns,btohqsg
They will know if the parents change address. Their system linked with IRAS and ICA. But whether they bother to follow up is up to them. 😁,btohqsg
hi  for the HFE letter if apply and dont exercise (ie apply for bto/resale) will there be any repercussions? like get a black mark or be deprioritised? and if it expires and you reapply/or dont reapply will there be any downsides?,btohqsg
also it assesses your prior 12mth cpf contribution right? what if one only contributed 9-10mths of the prior 12mths?,btohqsg
To my knowledge  no repercussions for not utilising it or needing to reapply,btohqsg
Then just provide what you can. They will assess it,btohqsg
No repercussions if you don’t use it within the validity period (9 months for now  usual 6 months validity),btohqsg
Just be aware it's in fact 14months prior application  -2 months when you apply,btohqsg
During application you will be able to select if you wish to opt in for the FPPS  MCPS or MGPS,btohqsg
And provide data while you apply such as parents address  doctor memo etc for the relevant schemes,btohqsg
yes  but u may not be successful in these schemes. and even if mcps successful  maybe the q number is not gotten from mcps,btohqsg
so if i only have contribution since feb 2023 they just take feb-dec if i apply in jan 2024? or -2mths feb -oct 2023 if i apply in jan 2024?,btohqsg
so many acronyms. what do they mean? so i just select all the schemes and see which they allocate in the hfe?,btohqsg
If apply in Jan 24  - 2 so ur 12mon period starts from Nov 24 to Nov 23,btohqsg
if apply jan 24 enough time for feb 24 bto? 12mths nov 22 - nov 23 if only feb 23 - nov 23 will be captured and got cpf contribution means gg? may as well not apply?,btohqsg
Hi I’m interested in Bishan Ridge. The ballot period has ended in 2020. How should I proceed from now?,btohqsg
see if sbf or obf have,btohqsg
sbf will be same price as bto?,btohqsg
To account for the reduction in building time,btohqsg
When will they inform u if u are eligible for the married / with kids priority scheme? Like still under public scheme lei,btohqsg
hi! asking for a friend - does hdb account for part time job and pay towards bto application (as 12-month work cycle) and EHG if hes a fresh grad? his fiance is unemployed.thanks!,btohqsg
Yes  and they will assume the same salary even if the applicant only worked 1 out of 12 months - they will assume monthly salary based on that one month alone  not ÷12,btohqsg
I doubt so. But maybe the expert here can share more,btohqsg
I did change the metal gate last year though.,btohqsg
Hi@dclim1please refrain from sharing links as no advertisements are allowed. Would appreciate if you could edit the link out of your message.I did not delete the message because I understand you have a question attached to this message.Thanks!,btohqsg
anyone knows which grc is hougang citrine under? cant tell if its marine parade or aljunid,btohqsg
yea its like at the border thats why wondering. not sure which grc MP to go to to appeal for stuff,btohqsg
If ure considering Bayshore  listen to this,btohqsg
Actually it’s more of the salt on the air that one should be concerned about  because salt is corrosive,btohqsg
Yea apply now get HFE can appeal to get it revise later,btohqsg
do these appeals actually go through? for the EHG grant. becasue it states need to be working continuously 12mths prior.,btohqsg
EHG grant - theyre quite strict about the continuous 12months of employment  but you’ll never know unless you appeal haha,btohqsg
HFE can be revised at a later time? For HDB loan amount?,btohqsg
I was suggested that from hdb,btohqsg
God bless. That's a good news.,btohqsg
But again that is the appeal process,btohqsg
Took me 2 Mon to reach that process,btohqsg
God knows how long they will take to revise the loan amount,btohqsg
this EHG when you sell still need to pay back to cpf? or is it totally wipe off the sale amount?,btohqsg
The ehg will back of your cpf,btohqsg
So it will return to your cpf,btohqsg
The appeal process must be completed before 1st appointment? Or is there a window period?,btohqsg
lets say bto cost 200k EHG 20k. so now full sum payable is 180k? loan repayment all only on 180k?  or is it when u sell need to pay back additional 20k to cpf? like a super long deferred payment? are all grant super long deferred payments? is there interet on these grants?,btohqsg
bto cost 200kehg 20k20% downpayment 40kloan: 140kwhen sell the house  need to pay back 20k + accrued interest back to cpf,btohqsg
See my Example below:BTO cost - 200kEHG - 20kDownpayment - 30kYou can use the 20k to pay for the downpayment. The remaining 10k you can pay with cash/CPFYour loan currently will be 170k.When you sell for maybe 250k250k - remaining loan (e.g. 100k)  you are left with 150kAssuming you use 50k from your CPF (downpayment (which is inclusive of your EHG) plus monthly mortgage)  this amount will go back to your CPFRemaining 100k cash will be credited to your bank account.,btohqsg
There is interest on the grant because the grant is credited into your CPF OA which should’ve been earning 2.5%  hence you need to deduct the principal and accrued interest used,btohqsg
anybody knows Toa Payoh showroom is open today or tomorrow to view the 3D models of BTO at the public area?,btohqsg
hello  i recently applied for a bto but forgot to tick the mcps option however managed to send an email to hdb a day after the application closure.. anyone in the same boat also asking to edit application? ://,btohqsg
Hi is there any altura ec chats?,btohqsg
Hi. May I check what's the difference between Estimated Waiting Time vs. Estimated TOP Date?In recent Dec 23 BTO launch  looking at Sin Min Residences Project as an example  Estimated Waiting Time is 32 mths (at about Aug-2026 starting from now) but Estimated TOP date from BTOHQ page is Jun-2027.That's about 10 months difference.Other projects also have similar differences.,btohqsg
That 32 months start from median of flat selection period.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check where can find how many ballots have people ballots for the BTO,btohqsg
As long as they amend before ballot can but their email. So slow high chance ur ballot won't be under mcps,btohqsg
Should've just cancel and redo  $10 only for the piece of mind,btohqsg
Cause ballot starts right after closing of the date...,btohqsg
How can we access the BTO project details?,btohqsg
The flat dashboard only shows upcoming projects...,btohqsg
Do you mean projects you applied for previously?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check is the models open to everyone view? Or need to book appointment,btohqsg
The one where we can view the titles,btohqsg
These and most of the project 3D models are not open to the public  you need an appointment,btohqsg
Then this nice home gallery is open to public?,btohqsg
HDB | MNH – My Nice Home Galleryhttps://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/gallery/,btohqsg
Do note it's a separate building connected via linkbridge,btohqsg
Alright! Is there anything else we need to see when we at tpy?,btohqsg
Nope  as far as I'm aware,btohqsg
Ohh Okok thank you so much 🙏,btohqsg
At toa payoh:- my nice home (open to public)- 3D models (most are restricted access  though some are outside like the Queenstown bto)- door / floor finishings (restricted access),btohqsg

Hi guys how's the Ccs from tengah?,btohqsg
I'm gonna collect my key on this year Aug,btohqsg
Hey guys  wanna find out/clarify some doubts:The 1st appt w HDB is to choose desired unit  pay option fee  sort out instalments plans?HDB loan amount stated in HFE is fixed or has anyone of you had your HDB loan amount re-assessed 9-mths prior to key collection?TIA!,btohqsg
First appointment only pay option fee and choose unit and confirm manner of holding (joint tenancy/tenancy in common/main applicant & essential occupier)HFE is a new scheme. Based on multiple data points from applicants emailing to HDB  they said that there would be no reassessment. Though they did say they will see reassessment on a case by case basis via appeal.,btohqsg
Hi just to clarify if that’s all we have to pay for for the first appointment  when do we need to pay the 20% down payment?,btohqsg
Are you eligible for staggered downpayment scheme?,btohqsg
How long after will that be from the first appointment?,btohqsg
Also just a note that it will be 5% or 10% at that point,btohqsg
I’m not too sure I have yet to check,btohqsg
The remainder will be at key collection,btohqsg
If you or your partner are under 30 years old you auto qualify,btohqsg
If you're under this scheme it's 5% at signing of lease appt  15% at key collection.Otherwise it's 10% 10%,btohqsg
should be around 6-9 months after  but you can also check with HDB when you go for the selection appt.If you qualify for EHG may be the longer end of the spectrum  otherwise may be on the shorter end of the spectrum,btohqsg
Can you go and check? It affects how much downpayment you have to pay during your second appointment (signing of lease agreement) and third appointment (nearer to key collection).Since you are eligible for staggered downpayment scheme  you will pay 5% of the unit price during your second appointment and 15% during your third appointment.,btohqsg
Got it should be in the HDB website as well right,btohqsg
I lay out the payments you need to do on your first  second and third appointment.First Appointment: Option fee 1-2k cash via NETS depending on your room type.Second Appointment: 5% of your unit price if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 10% of your unit price.Buyer stamp duty (low 10k to high 10k  near 20k)HDB conveyancing fees (few hundred dollars)If you are taking bank loan  10% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 20% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash + BSD and HDB conveyancing fees + lawyer legal fees ($2.5k-3k)Third appointment: remaining 15% if under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise remaining 10% plus  the other fees stated below,btohqsg
If 1 of us is above 30?,btohqsg
As long as one person qualifies,btohqsg
Btw  the total % depends on when your project was launched!,btohqsg
If above 30  is auto 10+10%?,btohqsg
The time between 1st and 2nd appointment roughly how long?,btohqsg
FYI in case anyone else is curious about the cut-off date for the % downpayment (NOTE this does not account for staggered downpayment scheme)https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease,btohqsg
The age 30  is go by birthday month?,btohqsg
"HDB states ""Applied for a flat on or before the younger applicant’s 30th birthday"" -> so it should be by the day of your application  whether the younger applicant is under or 30 and abovehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease",btohqsg
I think the deferred assessment is still a valid schrme,btohqsg

Question:Has anyone received HFE with an amount that is totally different from the HDB calculator?OrAnybody provided employment contracts instead of payslips during HFE application?,btohqsg
Anyone receive this email? Does it mean that we can participate in Feb BTO?Does it mean to apply for Feb BTO  means give up current BTO slot?,btohqsg
Your queue num is within supply? Eg 499/500? From my understanding you cannot ballot for other launches if you have an existing number that’s within supply. It’d be blocked from the frontend when you try to apply for feb,btohqsg
Is the Dec 2023 ballot result out?,btohqsg
"I believe you / your partner asked in Queenstown group also  but anyway yes HDB is saying they will ""exercise flexibility"" for you to apply for Feb 2024",btohqsg
Otherwise usually within supply you're not allowed to apply for another until you pass your selection appt for Queenstown,btohqsg
Hello how much should our combined income ceiling be for 550k Loan?,btohqsg
I hope can correct me on this Our HDB BTO is valued at 698kWe paid $2k option fee and $$49k+ for the 5% staggered downpayment and other fees applicable.So the remaining 15% would be around $105k?As we will be taking HDB loan  we want to ensure if our income ceiling can meet the LTV which is about 550k,btohqsg
The incoming ceiling is based on at point of application  of bto,btohqsg
If u really required confirmation u get it from hdb not just from some bto chat,btohqsg
Your HFE should have stated the loan amount you are eligible,btohqsg
So our HFE will be assessed next on the time before key collection,btohqsg
I see… then best to write into HDB,btohqsg
If i understand your question correctly  you're trying to figure out themintotal monthly income to be able to get a loan of 550k. That should be roughly $8.7k/mth combined income.You can try playing around with the parameters here to see the loan amount you're eligible forhttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budget,btohqsg

anyone know ah if ur appt is for example 10.30am if you go earlier will u be served earlier or die die 10.30am?,btohqsg
If you're asking about selection appt  the time that you actually get served is kind of dependent on the queue numbers in your project before you. I'm personally not sure whether it can be earlier than the stated time  but Ive heard that it can be later (because people before you take longer to select their flat and etc),btohqsg
its SBF. project already completed so not sure its just flat selection only or taking key on the same day also,btohqsg
Ohh I see. Not too sure about this. If anyone can advise  pls do! Else you can try asking in the SBF group chat,btohqsg
Mine was served a few min after the appt time. But I heard from the Q number way before me one says his one is like 8 min before the appt time.,btohqsg
so reach earlier and take queue number earlier = pointless/useless?,btohqsg
fck sia. i got hosp appt that day...at 11.15. if reschedule it will be 6 months later sia,btohqsg

Hi  i was offered a chance to choose a unit for my february BTO  but im not fond of any units. Do i still have to come down to HDB for my flat-selection appointment to reject it? and if i reject  will it affect my application for my next bto?,btohqsg
1. No you don't need to go down to reject it; a no-show is also taken as rejection2. Assuming you mean Feb 2022 bto  + this is your 1st time rejecting - in which case  no  it will not affect your next application. But any applications you make henceforth will be subject to the rule that any rejection will result in 2nd timer status for 1 year (this rule started in Oct 2022 bto onwards),btohqsg
feb sbf  anyone knws what date is it?,btohqsg

Hi. I have a bto coming this 3rd quarter and i recently tendered from my workplace to be a SAHM to my newborn. Only plan to work next year when my baby is bigger.Can i know if our grants will be affected? As i do not have 1yr running cpf contribution anymore. What will hdb recalculate on our keys collection day?,btohqsg
You were under Deferred Income Assessment previously?,btohqsg
If last time u get the grant already then won't be affected anymore.,btohqsg
I can't get HLE and for what I know as Singaporean I'm entitled to 2nd time HDB loan.Only take 1st time HDB loan for my current hse,btohqsg
Yes you’re eligible for HDB loan twice. Why you say you are unable to get HLE?,btohqsg
I don't why cos they claim that I doesn't want to take HDB loan during signing of my lease agreement back in Jan 2022 but I've already told them last time HLE can last 6 mths only so everytime need to apply again n again if expire.Last wed 16 Jan during key collection so pissed off with HDB that I paid off everything for my 3 gen hse.,btohqsg
Now CPF OA left with $28 but it's ok later during resale transaction later in Feb they will return back all my CPF plus accrued interest to my OA after cash proceed.So read carefully during lease agreement before signing😞,btohqsg
No. I got the grants already. Im just scared they recalculate and take away the grants on key collection day,btohqsg
They won’t lol. Once grants are disbursed they go to paying your unit,btohqsg
When will grant get credited? I already 2k to lock my unit. But havent get my grant money yet,btohqsg
So if my loan going to expire and i reapply. The grant value might change?,btohqsg
Don’t need to reapply already after you selected your unit,btohqsg
HDB never ask you to reapply right?,btohqsg
If i want to can i? Coz i have increase in pay. Current loan not enough. But grant is good. If i reapply  my loan amount go up my grant amount will go down?,btohqsg
Please note i havent pay downpayment. On secured unit,btohqsg
Wait until your grant disbursed to you then just before key collection you ask them to reassess,btohqsg
They will disburse it before your second appointment where you need to pay downpayment,btohqsg
Hi. Any groupchat for kim keat ripple?,btohqsg
Don't post unrelated stuffs here thanks,btohqsg
They will probably recalculate the loan amount that you are eligible for based on more recent incomes before key collectionShould be lower with lesser income,btohqsg
Taking up HDB loan is not something that one has to decide at the point of lease signingAs far as i know  HLE letter is needed during application / flat selection and reassessed when nearer key collectionNo need to apply again and again even if the one you had expires while you are waiting for the flat,btohqsg
I am lucky when I apply  haven't start this hfe mine is still hle.,btohqsg
Yes that's correct... cause still early 2022 at that point of time.... that's why told the officer later part in 2023 6 months before key collection will apply again....but don't understand why they say that I've agreed not to take loan during signing lease agreement but I did mentioned I need the HDB loan....misunderstood between both parties during that time causing me cannot get HDB loan instead ask me to take BANK loan.So piss off at that morning during key collection n I  settle all the remaining of 300k++ using CPF...this will cause my accrued interest throughout the coming years😡,btohqsg
Yes reassess grant and loan tgt,btohqsg
Hi all. We've applied for this Dec hle & bto based on our income. But wife wants to quit and be stay home mum. We intend to take HDB loan.Should I ask her to work until flat booking so that the loan amount won't be affected? After flat booking she quit won't affect the loan anymore right?,btohqsg
Ur loan amount will be reassessed again at key collection,btohqsg
Just to confirm  you applied HLE or HFE?,btohqsg
This reassessment is based on 12 months of continuous employment / cpf contribution also? Does anyone know?,btohqsg
job market in my sector is very voltile atm. worried about cpf gap,btohqsg
If ur is feb 23 launch like mine. Then is hle. I have an valid hfe but was asked to reapply for an hle during the flat selection day,btohqsg
So if it’s HFE  Grant and loan fixed already. HDB won’t change it,btohqsg
I'm sorry but is this confirmed? As me and my partner gotten new jobs with a significant difference in salary. We were assuming that there would be a reassessment of income before key collection. So if that's the case  do we have to reapply our HFE to be eligible for an increased loan amount?,btohqsg
If hle expired u cant reapply cos now HFE..have to wait nearing collection key date then they will inform us to reapply the hle. I asked hdb btw & Ive applied hle in 2022.😄,btohqsg
My concern is will the grant amount t change if i have increase in pay? Or just the loan amount will increase but grant amount will neither increase nor decrease,btohqsg
Grant wont change only loan will reassessed,btohqsg
Ok although have increase in pay. Initial grant will remain.,btohqsg
yes cos your grant will come first anyways  can just reassess your loan later closer to key collection,btohqsg
Just want to highlight that i havent get the grant amount yet. I havent make my downpayment yet either,btohqsg
Ahhhhh thank you for the clarification,btohqsg
Based on multiple emails to HDB  this is what they said. You can try emailing HDB to ask as well.,btohqsg
yup! select flat already? hfe validity is 9 months and only important when booking flat + closer to key collection.,btohqsg
Okay will do. I'll let yall know if they say otherwise  thank you!,btohqsg
Thanks. Do keep me updated as well :),btohqsg
Yes . Option fees already paid. Now waiting for downpayment. But understand nw that HFE not needed for downpayment and i can reassess nearing to key collection date,btohqsg
yaaaa then ur grant settle already,btohqsg
Hi all  I got this message but when I follow the instructions to check  there isn’t any update to my application. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
After proceeding u can find ur number of ballot and details,btohqsg
Lol-ed at thishttps://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/18z52yf/hfe_wont_be_reassessed_during_key_collection/Seems like HFE can be reassessed upon request,btohqsg
I can understand the grant amount being fixed but not the loan amount partUnder HLE  loan eligibility is reassessed when nearing key collection and this makes sense as ability to pay a loan may have changed by the time the flat is ready few years laterIn case a person has decreased income or lost job for prolonged period  one spouse decides to stay at home etc but doesn't ask for reassessment of HFE due to desperation of getting a flat  isn't HDB putting themselves at more risks?Unless there is a clause about false declaration or compulsory to update if income decreased when nearer key collection etc that is legally binding somewhere?Then again... Watching the HFE system crashed when it was first launched last year and how the SimplyGo saga unfolded recently... Bit no telling what the government is thinking these days,btohqsg
The answer  will be out when the time come,btohqsg
ballot results for dec bto is not out yet right?,btohqsg
Hi it’s not i think it will be through email,btohqsg
The more feedback it get maybe faster ?,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone here confirm whether a reassessment of income will be done (during key collection) if one is to apply as 1 student and 1 working adult now. The student will be working full time soon as such there will be 2 incomes instead.This is for HFE. I’ve called in several times but none of them is able to provide a concrete answer.,btohqsg
When is your estimated key collection?,btohqsg
Of course can bro  4 years is a long time for them to peg it to your initial letter loan amouny,btohqsg
They need to release grant early cause booking flat got DP so grant release first,btohqsg
2029 if all succeed  we are still waiting for the results which is in feb,btohqsg
Which is for people who have been employed aka students prior HLE  cause their HLE will be NO EHG eligibility,btohqsg
I’ve called in in regards to this context three times and none can provide me a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. So would like to ask if anyone knows or in the same situation,btohqsg
Do you think SBF applicants who use HFE can give feedback?Like  waiting time long enough for them to request reassess their loan eligibilityNot familiar with SBF process  ha haUsed to apply SBF but ended up getting my future place through BTO,btohqsg
Theirs is HFE... Should avoid dragging HLE inHFE is supposed to paint the entire picture... Grant  loanWhereas HLE is only for the loan partGrant is assessed separately,btohqsg
Anyone has group link for Bidadari Bartley green rise?,btohqsg
went for selection yesterday - officer said that no changes to loan amount even if income increase and will follow HFE letter. i did not even ask and she mentioned it so they must have been receiving many inquiries regarding this,btohqsg
Did the officer mention anything about if income becomes lesser?Maybe need people to uproar like it was done for SimplyGo 🫢,btohqsg
"Oh ok  thanks~Anyway  let us all keep an open mind...Who knows  they might decide to do reassessment next time or maybe there is such a thing as ""upon request""Actually  bit sianz about the ambiguityLike  does HFE really help people who want to get their own house",btohqsg

hello  i applied when we both are students and realised the moderate loan amount is only $187 700 and the maximum is $263 500 despite having $0 income. can i check if anyone has the same amount and will this mean our income assessment is deferred? don’t want to have to pay $500k in cash hahahaha,btohqsg
If you applied while you're both full time students the deferred income assessment scheme should automatically apply,btohqsg
ahhh but then why does it state that we are eligible for this amount of loan even even we haven’t worked for twelve months or is this the default,btohqsg
Sorry  I'm not familiar with the HFE application page. Maybe you can check with HDB directly to confirm,btohqsg

Maybe you can try asking in your project Telegram or fb group,btohqsg
I got a question about the option fee  is it possible to just get the default door without flooring or is it a set (must get door and flooring),btohqsg
choice 1: floorchoice 2: doors and toilet basins and showertoilet bowl and main door is given by defaultu can choose either choice 1 or choice 2 or none or both,btohqsg
For referencing - My appt timing was 930am and we were called in approx 929am! There was one before us.,btohqsg
Option fee and Optional Component Scheme (OCS) are 2 different things...?,btohqsg
Option fee is what you have to pay when you select your flatIf I'm not wrong  the amounts are:4rm and above is 2k3rm is 1k2rm is 500Optional component scheme is opting in to flooring / doors / sanitary fittings. Most projects will have OCS  but the details of OCS will be project by project,btohqsg
Then most likely is stick to time bah.,btohqsg

Think the results not out yet it say Feb,btohqsg
Out of supply as in ?I Saw unit list in hdb say85 so U meant mine ballot number is 86 and above then it's out of supply,btohqsg
Ya let’s say there are 100 units  if your number is like 200  you can apply. That’s my understanding of the new rules,btohqsg
Dec BTO result isn’t out yet right?,btohqsg
Hopefully we can get to see the result Tmrw,btohqsg
Anyone know when will Tengah SBF come out?,btohqsg
Oh so fast can see results?,btohqsg

Maybe they are Yishun projects from 2022 BTO exerciseThe locations are not very happening  20 - 30 mins walk to the nearest stations at either Khatib or Yishun,btohqsg
Wow 30min walk is far I supper is far like near Yishun ring road or the one nearly the seletar dam,btohqsg
Just curious 🤔 sbf example put Yishun how we know the block and floors,btohqsg
The completion year is the bigger problem. Got some newly launch Bto will even finish before some of this sbf.,btohqsg
so when they launch SBF officially they’ll mention till the block and unit number ?,btohqsg
We applying as a married couple expecting a baby this year  does that mean I can opt for the priority scheme? I tried to go to the priority scheme page on HDB it’s not loading so any explanation on how priority scheme works and how to opt in for that during application would be much helpful thanks in advance,btohqsg
Oh we have sbf chat where is the link?,btohqsg
No buses to mrt stn ?,btohqsg
~20 mins to the bus interchange  excluding waiting time,btohqsg
That’s very long . Maybe that’s y not many ppl took it up,btohqsg
That is a guess on my part thoughThere were 2 or 3 projects in Yishun during that launch  so might explain the supply that will be available in the upcoming February SBF,btohqsg
😱Ha ha  gonna study where the plots are again later,btohqsg
"Some projects in Yishun were really nice for home kind... But ""living"" may be another thing if the person has to go out for work",btohqsg
Still every bto is good btoFor some just want a place to stay,btohqsg
anyone knows when would the next BTO/SBF will take place? i heard its February but any likely dates?,btohqsg
Generally the so call ulu bto the price is slightly cheaper as compare to those near the mrt,btohqsg
As long within their budget why not 😁,btohqsg
next BTO is Feb  SBF I not sure,btohqsg
Feb .. wait for hdb to give dates. We all here don't know one.,btohqsg
When push comes to shove  those really desperate and need a flat will jus take it up?,btohqsg
the feb bto dates no indication? last few years feb bto anyone knows if beginning mid or end feb?,btohqsg
Wait for HDB to announce. No fixed schedule one,btohqsg
Usually end Feb but no fixed date,btohqsg
Hopefully before launch ah  makes sense to be before the next launch,btohqsg
But haiya knowing how they work so bochap and anyhow won't be surprised...,btohqsg
Last time they used to mail physical booklets before flat selection. Do they still do that?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can check available units before selection of unit email receive?,btohqsg

Tightened Rules for Non-Selection of Flat10. As part of our implementation of the tightened rules non-selection of flats  HDB will make the following adjustments to the application process from this BTO exercise onwards:BTO/Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) applicants who have received a queue position within the flat supply (e.g. in the October 2023 BTO exercise) will not be eligible to apply for a flat in subsequent BTO/ SBF exercises (e.g. in the December 2023 BTO exercise) until after their flat booking appointment. This will ensure that we do not crowd out other BTO applicants who have not secured a queue position and improve their chances in securing a flat.Upon incurring a non-selection count in a BTO/SBF exercise  HDB will cancel any existing applications made by the same applicant for subsequent BTO/SBF exercises. For example  those who are able to apply for both the October 2023 and December 2023 exercises  and subsequently incur a non-selection count for their October 2023 flat application will have their December 2023 flat application cancelled.OCT BTO onwards invite you don’t pick  all other application got cancelled.,btohqsg

But if you're merely looking for a gauge  divide your number by your flat type's supply (refer tothis post). If this is smaller than the numbers below  (a) you should be pretty safe  and (b) if you end up being unable to select a flat  this means that your project is record-breaking popular.Mature estate:1.17Non-mature estate:1.02Figures already account for ethnic quotas.Rationale:For the BTO projects with the lowest end-of-selection dropout rates observed thus far  all applicants who had a number within 117.1% (mature estates) or 101.5% (non-mature estates) of the flat supply got a chance to select a flat - regardless of ethnicity.
