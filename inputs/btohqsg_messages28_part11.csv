if you look at the overall costing it might be cheaper  really depends. cause tiling work requires semen screed  per sqft including materials and labour would be $10.50-$11.50 per sqft,btohqsg
Okay thanks for ur input anyway,btohqsg
i wouldn't recommend concealing your piping thou  even though it is a lot more aesthetically pleasing. my bf's neighbour's pipe leaked and they had to knock the whole floor off to replace it,btohqsg
depends if you're comfortable w it :),btohqsg
Maybe by then Inflation again. I am guessing 70-80k will be new norm,btohqsg
Haha saw the tik tok got one find cousin BF the. Alot shortcut de,btohqsg
just have to look for ID with an open mind  usually they charge more than what they promote  but that is for legitimate reasons. if it's ala carte it'll be a lot more pricier,btohqsg
and best to give yourself some leeway with the budget too,btohqsg
yeah hahaha that one really rabak ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Over budget tbh. You need time to build up CPF.,btohqsg
What will happen if unable to cover the value of the house?,btohqsg
You wonâ€™t be able to collect the keys,btohqsg
Can wait out to save the amt lacking? Or will have to give up the flat?,btohqsg
During key collection you need to have enough to cover the shortfall,btohqsg
If not have to give it up,btohqsg
By than you would have already paid 25% if Iâ€™m not wrong,btohqsg
I think if give up before key collection  should lose just the first payment of 10% if took hdb loan. 20% if bank loan,btohqsg
Than ban 1 year from applying hdb + downgrade to second timer,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/publications/hdbspeaks/deferment-of-key-collection-to-new-flatCan try apply to defer. Case by case basis,btohqsg
If the hdb loan short abit  can appeal in,btohqsg
"Hello everyone  wanna seek your advice on bto hdb loan.I jus went to select bto flat today  understand from the hdb officer that during the last appointment before key collection  hdb will wipe out me and my spouse cpf OA account (leaving behind min 20k) so that we reduce the loan we take from HDB.Is it possible to ""shield"" my spouse account from being wiped out by Hdb before the key collection appointment by transferring most of her CPF OA $$ to SA?",btohqsg
You wanna shield might as well use for investment. If investment still can return back to OA. Once you do OA to SA transfer  it is irreversible.That being said  if you are risk adverse  it is okay to do OA to SA transfer especially if you are nearing the prevailing FRS.,btohqsg

Hi guys! Can I confirm if itâ€™s compulsory to keep 20k in our OA or can wipe out OA during the first down payment? (:,btohqsg
Not compulsory  you can choose to wipe out all or leave up to 20k. Note that it is up to 20k   not definite amount,btohqsg
That is if you are taking hdb loan,btohqsg
If you are taking bank loan  you can rerain any amount. But recommended at least 20k,btohqsg
Hello morning everybody . Wanna check with you guys   when is the point where me and my spouseâ€™s cpf will get  wiped out for our bto ? Is it during the key collection appointment?,btohqsg

5R got 690 units. Now left about 27 units for Chencharu Hills,btohqsg
are you hoping that it runs out so you can go for AMK? ur queue for AMK looks better,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the info ;),btohqsg
I hope it will run out by end of this week,btohqsg
or at least can appeal to waive for non-selection,btohqsg
Hello! new here :) can i check if anyone knows when i can apply for priority scheme etc?,btohqsg

HDB shld give you that financial worksheet,btohqsg
Previously applied for hfe and was granted 90k. Applied for new one recently and it became 30k instead.,btohqsg

Increase in income is it. Now HFE is valid for 9 months. Your last HFE should be some time back then  if you have existing HFE you canâ€™t apply new one also.,btohqsg
