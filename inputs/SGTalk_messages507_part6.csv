Wanted to. Then got one auntie standing behind me staring at me when I took my phone out... So I no choice have to take that auntie pic 😔,btohqsg
I think late 30s or early 40s,btohqsg
Go workout wear makeup....why sia 🤣,btohqsg
Sob…my nonya food become this instead…,btohqsg
There are worse.ways to go 🤣,btohqsg
Half the time she sat down there using phone,btohqsg
This is the non in nonya,btohqsg
Might as well stay at home,btohqsg
Ok de  when they no flex and pump they actually look way smaller,btohqsg
Go fish or pass time only ba,btohqsg
重点 is 钓 fit 仔.. Workout is secondary 😂,btohqsg
no no you dun understand ~ play phone in gym more feeling 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
There’s a lot of ppl doing that,btohqsg
why no one 釣 me 🥲,btohqsg
Actually for the weaker human including myself  we do need more recovery time between sets.Sorry for taking up space in the gym. 😔,btohqsg
You weak as in what happen to your body?,btohqsg
Recovery understandable  but the whole time sit down there and do nothing but playing phone,btohqsg
Ya lame sia  might as well do something more thrilling elsewhere,btohqsg
You didn't notice only. The guy in next station tried his best to 钓 you but to no avail,btohqsg
Really there’s alot of these ppl in gym,btohqsg
Sometimes i dulan and asked if they are done,btohqsg
Not adapted to exercise yet. Noob  newbie. Or injured and recovering.All of them need longer recovery period between sets.,btohqsg
Oh if recovering should move away from station. They sit there and occupy ah? Aiyo.,btohqsg
Unless you do like strength training or extremely heavy sets  shouldn’t rest more than 3-5 mins maxedIf not it’s kinda like defeat the purpose hahahaBut ya la some sit at one machine 30 mins I dunno wtf they doing,btohqsg
but ok la usually I go ask how many sets you left? They start to hurry Liao,btohqsg
I saw the handsome guy again !! From my office pantry..  His col car is parked below.. oh my ~ the timing so zhun 😍,btohqsg
Hahah. If like me then dun waste money sibo,btohqsg
SPRING IS COMING FASTER JUMP INFRONT OF HIS CAR,btohqsg
Semooooo I nv said anything arrr,btohqsg
You are benchmarking on young healthy people.Older people cannot workout like you.Extreme eg. 70+ knee injury. Walk 5min  rest 10min. If not will aggrevate rather than recover.,btohqsg
you must time it right  the car just slightly brushed you then you fall to the ground aiya! Then he comes out and held you in his arms ask if you are ok  then you stare deep into his eyes and connect with his soul and the rest is history,btohqsg
I was rushed last time and injured myself lor. 😢,btohqsg
Scarly come out one is his col. Wrong target lol,btohqsg
hmmmm then they probably in the first place won’t be hogging the machines and doing the dumbbells instead Liao ~,btohqsg

Don't like that. No fish  prawn also can,btohqsg

Don't worry. Tall handsome man got longer limbs. Even if shorter colleague exit car first  still slower than tall handsome man at reaching you.,btohqsg

I find that shorter people have faster reaction times actually,btohqsg
