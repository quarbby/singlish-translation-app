Android auto wasn't that great for me,btohqsg
It spans from top to bottom of my windshield,btohqsg
So went with a full android,btohqsg
I tried dash taped on one,btohqsg
Cos my dash very curved downwards,btohqsg
I tried 3 aircon vents mount,btohqsg
Why don't go for Android ones,btohqsg
1 wont fit cos circle vents,btohqsg
It worked well but got some flaws,btohqsg
The carplay dongle idk why i plug in,btohqsg
Nvm i use the built in map,btohqsg
I dont want to mount it on my dash cos i hate wires and random boxes lying around,btohqsg
You use the pioneer need to plug cable to the phone right,btohqsg
My phone is an issue la  i even tried to use those mount put infront of speedo,btohqsg
But my phone blocks entire gauge cluster,btohqsg
Then i really dk wat to do alr,btohqsg
But recently someone intro me CD slot mount,btohqsg
I nv knew it existed if not i'd try,btohqsg
That time I just throw my phone onto passenger seat,btohqsg
Alot of times i holding in my hands,btohqsg
but 1 thing i definitely will miss on android,btohqsg
i always stream stuff while i drive,btohqsg
Later I try my Android auto see what shows up,btohqsg
Been thinking how to link my phone to my Android wirelessly,btohqsg
I thought is see the HU can support wireless or not one,btohqsg
I am fine with cable la,btohqsg
if not is just chuck into the glove box,btohqsg
i mean it's mostly data transfer mode ma,btohqsg
Haven't tried plugging my phone to the android to see what happens,btohqsg
I have both pioneer and android in mine,btohqsg
Yep the whole middle dashboard all screensðŸ¤£ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Can watch f1 race when never make it home,btohqsg
"""Tesla style"" is what it's advertised on",btohqsg
Next time can dont pay singtel alr,btohqsg
Hit and miss la  but when you desperate it's all you got,btohqsg
If I can I always watch at home,btohqsg
My car cannot even watch anything,btohqsg
And you have the newest among us,btohqsg
They put the price so high but like that,btohqsg
your HU not stock one meh,btohqsg
Please give me the money this week,btohqsg
I actually vote HU over coils,btohqsg
the stock HU is good enough la. Got android auto,btohqsg
So that i can enjoy coils for a week before i go to back to back surgerh,btohqsg
On the road i am dying no way,btohqsg
I see lorry going so comfy on the road than me while i bouncing,btohqsg
