wah my batch is a giant sia honestly,btohqsg
my batch seem to have the most hybrid classes,btohqsg
Meanwhile my cg rep does nth,btohqsg
leaves all these to the subject reps to do the reminders,btohqsg
but uk for the whole 2y my cg rep couldnt log to her tmip i think,btohqsg
i think the password cant be changed,btohqsg
need go through admin to change,btohqsg
then like they if need use tmip to verify marks how lol,btohqsg
for my batch the mark sheets are printed out,btohqsg
But like I just do since,btohqsg
I alrd doing it for myself,btohqsg
wait what is the diff between cg rep and psl,btohqsg
Figured I might as well do for my class,btohqsg
But usu we just help eo with shit when we can la,btohqsg
actually it is a good initiative (but im not sure coz it didnt happen for my batch ah),btohqsg
did the class become more bonded,btohqsg
Tbh I believe my role is,btohqsg
Just make sure no one is suffering alone,btohqsg
Just no inter clique beef good enough,btohqsg
The principal say some schs asking abt how TM's psl do stuff lol,btohqsg
actually as i was retrieving a photo from my dad's phone  i saw something interesting and WOW...coz my class bully was same cca as my cousin. Then my cousin somehow knew it and when she tried running for exco  my cousin told the cher about she bullying me  and then the cher rejected the application dun let her run lmao,btohqsg
Cuz they wanna learn from us,btohqsg
It used to be more slack tho from what I hear,btohqsg
Now they give us more shit to do,btohqsg
but where did they find time for y'all to do the activities,btohqsg
Usu is either CCE lesson or booths during recess,btohqsg
sometimes it is not suffering  sometimes it is people not giving any shit about their work  that way it is hard to help tbh,btohqsg
i believe it started from xavier's batch when he j2,btohqsg
My ability to give a fuck,btohqsg
tbh in class i know who actually taking the effort and who dun give a shit,btohqsg
It's rly the guys being CB la imo,btohqsg
I legit sometimes think of rly,btohqsg
the reason why h1 phy was 50.7% U rate is the students not the tutors because h1 phy has the 2 good phy tutors (mr bryan leong and mr lim yew wei),btohqsg
as much as i know some teachers in tm are not to standard  sometimes it is the students...,btohqsg
yea i just let them do what they want to do,btohqsg
wah damn  i cant remember what goes on in CCE,btohqsg
i think 3/4 of the time i dun actually listen,btohqsg
i think i treated gp and cce lesson a mugging period,btohqsg
even if the teachers suck  it's usually still the students,btohqsg
when you mention CCE lessons in oral knowing damn well you never listen during CCE,btohqsg
tbh true  just needa do more to get the grades tho...like in jc i remembered my friends are my tutors coz my chem & math cher really cant teach (and a lot of chem and math qns are in my photo gallery lmao),btohqsg
