x/2(x/2) - 1/2 = x/2 - 1/2(x/2 - 1/2)/2- 1/2 = (x/4 - 1/4)/2- 1/2 = x/8 - 1/8 - 1/2(x/8 - 1/8)/2- 1/2 = x/16 - 1/16 - 1/2x/16 - 1/16 - 1/2 = 0x/16 - 1/16 - 1/2 = 0x - 1 - 8 = 0x - 9 = 0x = 9,btohqsg

Ur ans 15 is possible but idt guess n check is the solution to this qn,btohqsg
I tried models n I got 9,btohqsg
My friend do they got 12 24,btohqsg
In essence this isnt a math qn,btohqsg
Correct ans is katie shld get bttr friends,btohqsg
Is it coincidental it's the same date as tdy?,btohqsg
my cher *thinks* it's 15. he hasn't confirmed yet,btohqsg
Well time to try again for myself,btohqsg
you want to see a bombshell?,btohqsg
this qns is also done by american students,btohqsg
alot of ppl has done it and 15 is the widely accepted answer,btohqsg
Ngl looking at old posts makes me lowkey sad,btohqsg
Like I think cos I hate my old self,btohqsg

I asked my cher for funny questions to bring back from tuition,btohqsg
he give me this one lol,btohqsg
yeah I trying to find the method other than brute force,btohqsg
or is this game theory alr,btohqsg
if primary schoolers can solve this  I will cry,btohqsg
Alberts statements means thr are two same dayes,btohqsg
is it special method or pure brute force calculation,btohqsg
cos working backwards/checking answer is easy. finding the solution different,btohqsg
June 17/ August 17July 14/August 14,btohqsg
From this if beenard accurately knows one,btohqsg
using this method I can only cross out 19 because it doesn't repeat,btohqsg
actually I think this is related to computer science alsk,btohqsg
I think it has similarities in P vs NP,btohqsg
My ans for the qn is now 30..,btohqsg
Myb I think I teach until brain gonez,btohqsg
if its the doughnut one  my cher say 15,btohqsg
first statementJune 17/August 17 July 16/May 16 July 14/August 14 there must be duplicate month and date,btohqsg
he got degree in math la so I trust him,btohqsg
Math is a matter of opinion😳,btohqsg
math is the universe's source code,btohqsg
I like to say i am,btohqsg
The logic is to eliminate every thing that repeats twiceMay 15 16 and 19 eliminateAugust 14  15 and 17 eliminatejuly 14 and June 17 eliminate.Now you are left with June 18 and July 1618 appears once16 twice but May has already been eliminatedFor July  14 already eliminated therefore ans is 16,btohqsg
Im just gymmin to escape the grind,btohqsg
if eliminate everything that repeats twice   then July 16 should be gone wad,btohqsg
if you follow the steps to the end,btohqsg
why can't be June 18 or may 19,btohqsg
Cant be may because 3 values and 2 people will leave 1 value being unaccounted for,btohqsg

"What bernard said cuts down the possible dates to only the month with 2 values- In his thinking  he only has June and JulyAlbert-Month and Bernard-DateAlbert thought process- (""Unlikely bernard will know the month"")Bernard-(""At first i had thought of it as June but Now i think its July)Albert-(July? you say  ok i know the date)Scenario 1: If albert thought the number was 1414 only appears once so when cheryl said the month  he should have known the date before bernard confirms it.Scenario 2:if albert thought the number was 1616 appears twice hence he would be skeptical and needed to wait for confirmation from Bernard.Scenario 2 is what the conversation is about",btohqsg
I think albert and bernard must stay away from Cindy cos shes a wierdo,btohqsg

bro u remember him more than me,btohqsg
actually ah  why only month with 2 values. 3 also can no?,btohqsg
wah sitting down at computer so shag,btohqsg
if it was May or August..Albert wont know even after bernard say he knows because they have 3 values,btohqsg
but at the end albert knows,btohqsg
so it can only be through elimination of two values..that he comes down to a single value,btohqsg
In the scenario...elimination with 3 values is impossible,btohqsg
nah i tell you who's the bigger one,btohqsg
cause of the marks you get,btohqsg
why is bday guessing so hard,btohqsg

For the US to openly ask for spies to spy on russia....Its sending a message to Russia but i wonder what message,btohqsg
trying to destroy the enemy from within,btohqsg
meaning US intelligence knows/suspects Russia is crumbling from within alr,btohqsg
recently  Prigozhin (leader of Wagner) also openly scolded Putin,btohqsg
and also Russia is a very dire state. Ukraine invasion is life or death for them and recently they just announced they would offer citizenships for foreign volunteers which shows they have manpower shortage alr,btohqsg
but it might be US crumbling as well. china is set in a position where it has the ability to overtake the US in the world order. and the last time a power shift occured  a world war happened ah,btohqsg
large scale infra projects puts them in extremely heavy debt,btohqsg
not true  they outsource their debt,btohqsg
they borrow money to lend other people money,btohqsg
u see their belt and road initiative is paid for by the benefiting nations. if they default their debt  their surrender control to China for example the Sri Lankan port that will be under Chinese control for the next 99 years. not only China  spend $0  they get free money generators around the world. coupled together with the fact that many of these 'benefitting' nations get closer ties with China meaning UN votes and resolutions will go China's way,btohqsg
previously there were hundred+ nations who recognize Taiwan as the real china due to the One china policy.  Now less than 10 recognize Taiwan and who knows what would happen if that number becomes 0. PRC might see it as a justification to invade Taiwan and boom  US is in war.US has 31T debt including government bonds  they won't be able to fund the war unless they default on their debt. Which means no matter the outcome of the victor in a hypothetical US-CN war  a power shift will definitely occur,btohqsg
bought some shares at a happy price,btohqsg
how to make that even realistic,btohqsg
