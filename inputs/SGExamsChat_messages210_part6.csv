Tats y I never buy from them,btohqsg
What’s a good mid tier jc ? How do y’all compare which jcs are good,btohqsg
One is the basic naive way  which is cut off point,btohqsg
i think how good a jc is rlly based off the twachers who will teCh u tbh,btohqsg
How about brand name and culture,btohqsg
But when it comes to schools with closer COPs  you should consider the niches each JC has,btohqsg
culture p impt if ur vulnerable to that,btohqsg
if ur the kind to not give a shit abt anhone else and create ur own bubble,btohqsg
If u have special things u want to do,btohqsg
Choose school with specialty in those,btohqsg
Brand name is a legitimate concern if you applying Govt scholarships or anything like that,btohqsg
Or certain programme that certain sch offer,btohqsg
at lwast for me my sch didnt help me,btohqsg
but i still did q abit,btohqsg
Then what’s a mid tier jc that’s better brand name and what’s worse brand name,btohqsg
but self source also an alternative so donr beat urself up if u donf get one w,btohqsg
Yea  I have self source haha,btohqsg
Research is with outside higher institutions?,btohqsg
But den certain sch also offer certain combi,btohqsg
all those w brand name have fheir own scandals as well la,btohqsg
I never considered brand name before haha  but I guess like what John said  if u want gvt scholarship I guess,btohqsg
more often than not its self fulfilling that they have good students gravitsting to their sch,btohqsg
Some JCs can ride off past prestige,btohqsg
Exactly who the hell came up with this branding of schs sia,btohqsg
every sch is a good sch rmb,btohqsg
Acjc is only like mid tier if u consider COP  but the ACS brand is still there,btohqsg
So much bullcrap by MOE haha,btohqsg
this school is not a good school,btohqsg
Between ACJC and SAJC it seems AC got better brand name,btohqsg
Cause AC has ACS behind it,btohqsg
i tot AC only known for ricj ppl HAHAH,btohqsg
SA ppl r chill i quite like those ppl ik frm thr,btohqsg
Rmb to check what the school offer   and whether it suits u,btohqsg
Some sch don't offer certain subject,btohqsg
H3 is uni teach one no?,btohqsg
The only 2 H3 subjects im eligible for both are MOE,btohqsg
its like a mix of everything,btohqsg
and u gotta study for it on ur own,btohqsg
i think that applies to alot of bio,btohqsg
like they give u some crash course and go bye suckers read it urself,btohqsg
Uni H3 for Chem and maths when?,btohqsg
For H3 Physics have uni NTU Semi conductor or MOE H3 physics iirc,btohqsg
Got SMU Game theory and smt else,btohqsg
Physics should donate a H3 to maths,btohqsg
