Hi all  may I know how much I can expect to pay to change wheel bearing? I see forum some say all in 100-300 while some say is like 200+ per wheel,btohqsg
Labour differ from ws to ws also,btohqsg
I see mine is an Altis  not sure where to get it change haha,btohqsg
The people that I know insist I go back to the dealer where I buy it from and quote lemon law  but wheel bearing is like wear and tear I think hard to fight  so considering to go outside settle myself,btohqsg
I changed my front two for my civic fd was 320 iirc,btohqsg
Anyway they got put there big big no cover wheel bearing,btohqsg
And just nice when have issue is the wheel bearing lol,btohqsg
I guess they experienced enough to exclude it from their T&C,btohqsg
I see  both 320 or each?,btohqsg

Hi editors  I have seen some of your review of the cars in sgcarmart. Like it so much. I have one request to your Boot space review. As I am a golfer  I always look for a car that can fit the golf bag nicely. So besides the Luggage and. Auntie trolley challenge  please include golf bag challenge in your review  especially on the SUVs.. I believe many golfers here will appreciate it.,btohqsg
Thanks Alvin! Thats actually a v good suggestion. I've just sent this to our video team :),btohqsg
Can try to fit in the boot also? You never know when you need to carry...another passenger...,btohqsg

Not emissions  they bring in low spec because they sell on brand name not performance and features,btohqsg
And it helps them keep the arf low,btohqsg
If it was emissions why they sell G63?,btohqsg
Or other 63s with the 4.0 V8 biturbo,btohqsg
For kia they downsize engine to be in Cat A and bring down cost of ownership,btohqsg
They looking at bringing back the V8 already,btohqsg
