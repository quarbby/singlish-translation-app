As anyone confirmed with OCBC bank that $500 spending on OCBC INFINITY will give you another 0.6% interest on OCBC 360 saving account?I sent a secured mail via the app to ask but their reply didn't mention OCBC INFINITY is included as an eligible card for 0.6% interest on OCBC 360 saving account.,btohqsg
interestCharge at least S$500 to your OCBC 365  OCBC NXT  OCBC 90°N or OCBC Titanium Rewards Credit Card.,btohqsg
its in their website when u goggle ocbc 360 int under spend bonus,btohqsg
Can anyone advise if my one account bonus interest will be forfeited; if I emptied my account during the earmarked date 31/8 for uob National day promo and then top it back up on the 1/9 ?,btohqsg
Hi guysi have dbs altitude cardim expecting to pay annual fee this year to get 10k milesbut i see there is auto annual fee reversal on my statement.should i tell the dbs that i want to pay my annual fee ?,btohqsg
You might want to consider if it's worth buying the miles.. 🤔,btohqsg
I use UOB Amex to grab then paynow for 0.3%,btohqsg
Oh u mean the uob absolute cb card or?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know what's the recommended credit card strategy for 120k salary to earn miles?,btohqsg
this for your main spend categorythe rest use 4mpd cards l,btohqsg
UOB lady solitaire card (main) + Citi rewards (secondary) + amaze?,btohqsg
Uob lady solitaire+amaze together also can iirc,btohqsg
Everything except selected categories go CRMC,btohqsg
Am thinking UOB lady solitaire for travel and the rest for crmc (since Crmc can't do travel),btohqsg
Works also but that depends if u travel often  to me 6mpd sounds like a good thing to miss out on(Note that travel cat is abit weird  do read ML Article for it),btohqsg
Okay thanks bro  will have a read 👍Was thinking travel cos airlines and hotels typically will exceed the 1k spending limit on other cards,btohqsg
"Heh  for that I use UOB KrisFlyer (but note that the ""travel"" mcc here is limited to certain merchants only too) if exceed 1k  else HSBC Revolution",btohqsg
Okay let me check that out UOB krisflyer too 👍,btohqsg
Most travel-related MCCs are covered by it (the HSBC Revolution Card). [the downside for this is really the 1k limit]{Source},btohqsg
If I have bills under:SP 💧Geneco ⚡Viewqwest 💻Gomo 📱Is there any one card I can use to pay for them? I thinking uob absolute amex and seeking other options too.,btohqsg
Because it is mentioned in Chris video that OCBC INFINITY is also one of the credit card for OCBC 360 saving account. That's why I want to verify...,btohqsg
This is a very good question and one that I honestly don't have a 100% accurate answer to.My feel is banks are only getting more and more conservative these days and the past approvals we saw of luxurious and generous credit limits may be over.With more banks learning how to read the Credit Bureau report more accurately  and with the general feel that economy is getting worse and job retrenchments hitting anybody anytime  my feel is the Credit Departments of the major banks have only grow more conservative over the years.Banks will typically not disturb whatever limits that had been granted in the past unless you specifically submit documents and trigger a credit limit review.And I still have the belief that one should not cancel limits that have already been approved because you may not even get back the same limit approved in the future even if you re apply with higher income than in the past.,btohqsg
Those of you in the DBS / ANZ credit card merge era will remember how DBS did it... rather incredulous in my view...DBS ADDED the credit limit that ANZ given to the customer  WITH NO CAP.So if your DBS limit was $200k and your ANZ limit was $150k... your new DBS limit was $350k i kid you not.,btohqsg
This card not even published on ocbc page yet. It's like a product in closed beta right now  pending official announcement,btohqsg
hello all  can points be earned for mrt/bus rides using the hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
10 min reminder to 3pm Dyson Airwrap deal,btohqsg
If already got uob lady solitaire might as well get the other uob cards  ppv  vs  prvi for backup. Coz uob points pool,btohqsg
Amex tcb got a limit use like 1k only?Citi rewards also got 1k limit?,btohqsg
Local banks seem v conservative indeed  but foreign  banks easily up by limit like nobody’s biz,btohqsg
The above is cash reward only. Do take note UOB has 5% p.a for the first $100 000 if you fulfil some criteria.,btohqsg
5% $100k.- r u  talking about the stash account?,btohqsg
I see. I am actually thinking to cancel and get free gifts 6 months later. But I am worried that they will reject the application as my CBS is not good. The rejection of credit limit review might a sign. However I just got approval from DBS/POSB with 10k limit. My current OCBC is just 2.7k limit.,btohqsg
Youtrip wallet sgd to yen only 107.3 Amaze wallet already hit 107.9.Too bad max 3k sgd only for amaze wallet.,btohqsg
Hello  my coffeeshop has the SQ QR code payment option but it does not have Xnap available. Is there anyway I can get cashback from PayLah?,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + citi for 4 mpd on spa/massage shop mobile payment from Apple wallet + amaze?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone know where can we get information on the rebate rate for UOB merchants  preferably on a single site? Understand that these expenses cannot qualify for the $600 min requirement for cashback on UOB EVOLParticularly im looking for Chi Cha San Chen,btohqsg
i m not working so cant apply credit cards,btohqsg
U can if u pit in 10k as secure deposit,btohqsg
then the credit limit is based on ?,btohqsg
Then apply cc card if willing to put in 10k  u need go bank to ask,btohqsg
Me retire gets solitaire card. As long as u have some records of credit card payments with existing bank  I think usually approve,btohqsg
If I purchase vouchers from shop back  is that considered as qualified spending on uob one?,btohqsg
Depends on the bank. I will say 80% to 100%.,btohqsg
