Have anyone tried bill payment with Standard Chartered credit card on Standard Chartered Internet banking? Any cash advance charges?,btohqsg
Not updated. Always refer to the T&Cs,btohqsg
I read from the tnc as you can only select one fund per user for the campaign and it stated 60k is for USD and 80k is for SGD. You can try and see otherwise and let us know ,btohqsg
Yes & there's a cash adv charge from SC,btohqsg

Hello seniors. Im in the miles game and currently have to claim sq miles before they expire.  Do you have any experiences on how to better utilize the miles on SQ? The saver looks tempting compared to the advantage. Any tips and advices are appreciated. Thank you,btohqsg
I guess crmc points still have 5y validity  separated from card validity?,btohqsg
No idea what you are referring to but I redeemed SQ flights to üáøüá¶ for 3 economy class seats when the airfare is high few months back for travelling in June. The price is even higher now. ü´¢,btohqsg

Hey guys. I couldn‚Äôt find it so I want to ask.If I bought something for $5000  straight pay-off $800 and pay the rest $4200 by Citi paylite/instalments? Does my $800 still count towards the required spend to get my Welcome Bonus miles?,btohqsg
Bro. Share which credit card not award miles not blocks of 5.. let's learn together,btohqsg
Maybe when u refer local bank as ocbc dbs uob  while some consider local bank as others. For miles card generally block of $5 for the big 3 sg bank for base miles. But cashback card dont need,btohqsg
What I know of local banks that rewards 4 miles usually are blocks of 5...,btohqsg
Citibank crmc and hsbc revo dont need,btohqsg
citi rewards $1 blockhsbc revolution no blockdbs wwmc  9x point $0.556 blockuob lady 9x points  no blocketc.,btohqsg

**Regarding UOB One***Sorry  I just watched Chris's video on Tax Payment thru CardUp. May I know if my plan below works?Background:-I always wanted to open an UOB One Account but couldn't fulfill the monthly $500 credit card spending consistently.-I am currently using OCBC 360 (with GIRO salary crediting)-I am currently holding UOB Stash account under Rising Dragon Promotion (the earmarked amount should be released by 18th May 2024).My Plan:-Open a UOB One account now.-Apply UOB Evol Card now.-Setup CardUp tax payment arrangement with UOB Evol Card before 24th May 2024.-Transfer $150 000 (from UOB Stash Account) on 1st June 2024.-Fulfill the monthly salary crediting requirement thru FAST/PAYNOW from my DBS personal account from June onwards.-Fulfill the monthly credit card spending requirement thru UOB Evol Card for tax payment via CardUp monthly from June onwards.Question:1) Does my plan makes sense? (UOB Evol + CardUp to fulfill UOB One Credit Card spending and FAST payment from DBS personal account to fulfill Salary Crediting requirement)2) I just searched Cardup inHeymax.ai  seems like UOB Evol Card is eligible for 8% cashback. Is CardUp considered online spending with $20 cashback cap for CardUp spending ($600)? While the CardUp fee for $600 is less than $20.3) To fulfill the credit card spending in June  should I setup CardUp tax arrangement on 24th May or 24th June? If I setup the arrangement on 24th May  when will CardUp charge my card?Thanks!,btohqsg
WWMC is $0.556 block ? üò±I didn‚Äôt know that,btohqsg
Evol doesn't earn cashback with cardup. You may use the cardup calculator to find the best cards to pair with,btohqsg
To answer all 3 qn  don't make sense because CardUp is not eligible for rewards.,btohqsg
Thanks  I see. I am new to heymax.Let me find out.,btohqsg
Heymax is not 100%. T&c is.,btohqsg
Thanks. But to earn the 4% interest  I am willing to pay $20 for the CardUp fee? Can CardUp spending via UOB EVOL fulfills the UOB One spending requirement?,btohqsg
You might want to check the t&c for UOB One account.,btohqsg
Ops... CardUp* (w.e.f. 1 Aug 2022)Thanks,btohqsg
Hi folks. Would like to seek opinion whether this Amex card for existing card holder is a good consideration for miles accumulation?https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/campaigns/milelion.html#platg,btohqsg
Welcome offer yes. Day to day no. Amex are more benefits card than collecting points,btohqsg
Thanks! I‚Äôm new to the miles accumulation community and have a lot to learn from all the masters over here.,btohqsg
For payment of income tax using card up  there is a promotion which seems better for Visa.Is there any Visa cards available for miles accumulation which does not have a 1k cap per month? Otherwise since my income tax is more than 1k per month  there would be ‚Äúwastage‚Äù.. anybody with the same problem?https://mainlymiles.com/2024/03/28/cardup-offering-2024-income-tax-payments-from-1-75-fee/,btohqsg
