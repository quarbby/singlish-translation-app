Hi... Does amaze + ocbc credit card spend count towards ocbc 365 bonus interest calculation?,btohqsg
Ok.. Means theres no blanket Amaze nerf.... Thanks,btohqsg
When you reach 55  CPF will transfer a maximum sum of FRS to RA. If you intend to have a higher payout from 65  one has to topup to RA. Tax relief after 55 only applicable to RA. From your example  @55RA will be 200k (based on FRS)  member can draw the excess balance in SA/OA. Topup will not affect the withdrawal of excess funds. Top up to RA will only be withdraw as payout when you reach the eligible age,btohqsg
