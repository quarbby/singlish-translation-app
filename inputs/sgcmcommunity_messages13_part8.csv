If they can’t find a way to charge us   the sun will never rise again,btohqsg
as soon as they get everyone onboard  then they will remove subsidies etc,btohqsg
Fines for those who over stay their time at the limited charging stations.,btohqsg
malaysia gives 5 years tax free,btohqsg
Give chicken wing then take back while chicken strategy,btohqsg
Which is the point  electric not necessarily green,btohqsg
At least road not so congested,btohqsg
why is it not green. taxing it is not the same,btohqsg
Maybe you would like to consider this Mr X,btohqsg
get the environment clean and green first,btohqsg
And this  and the source of the electricity being used,btohqsg
argggh dont worry about that. this never ends,btohqsg
It a confrim thing most of the goverment cutting ice by 2040,btohqsg
yes mr arnav! good case study! very resourceful,btohqsg
we dont care how it is produced in the back end or elsewherewhat matters is the air,btohqsg
If everyone is electric  everyone will move fast  same average speeds. Congestion will not end with faster speeds,btohqsg
if you want to solve air polution  get all vehicles to run electric,btohqsg
And that is important due to chain effect,btohqsg
this is carbon emissions reduction objective.,btohqsg
the production of materials  etc etc. still have air pollution in the process mah,btohqsg
Yes the big game is carbon credit,btohqsg
But isn't the whole point to end it?,btohqsg
who cares how batteries is produced.,btohqsg
no. you cannot solve everyting. you pick themost dire problem to solve. the most pressing one first.,btohqsg
Many ev drivers seem to switch for this reason. Best bang for buck to get performance fast,btohqsg
why do i care how they produce batteries. i dont want to read those stuff,btohqsg
It’s the overall picture one has to consider,btohqsg
then in that case you still produce carbon emissions and you are stuck in the same place,btohqsg
because when they produce batteries  the earth is further affected.,btohqsg
In this argument  probably you? Since you want to go green sir. If you want to go green  cannot just go electric and call it a day. The electricity must be from renewable sources and the production of batteries and their disposal should result in less emissions as well,btohqsg
you cannot have overall picture when that has not been found yet,btohqsg
the whole thing as mr anwo has said is the overall picture that you have to see,btohqsg
so sir may i ask what you think is the overall picture of electric cars?,btohqsg
2 steps forward 3 steps back..,btohqsg
lets direct the question back to you sir! :),btohqsg
cannot do electric because err other problkems and then other problems. what do you want,btohqsg
Ok  so solve shipping. The most polluting industrial activity in the world,btohqsg
first we want to solve carbon emissions emitted from fossil fuels. so going electric is the obvious choice.,btohqsg
there's the production  usage and disposing of materials and usage of all electric cars etc  that's full circle isn't it?,btohqsg
okay  what is singapore primary source of electricity..,btohqsg
no sir  we are just thinking  about the issues that electric cars cause in the long run,btohqsg
but then you talk about oh how to generate the power to make batteries and this never ends,btohqsg
if this electirc thing lasts 50 years then it is good enough,btohqsg
What is the largest emission contributor of all?,btohqsg
precisely! how would you want to deliver your electric cars?,btohqsg
fossil fuel is still powering SG grid... so you are still burning fossil fuel if you use electricity...,btohqsg
yeah that may be wiser too!,btohqsg
Less humans   less energy used.  Hence less global warming hence less use of vehicles,btohqsg
It’s thinking deeper about issues beyond the surface,btohqsg
you guys can bne experts this way then,btohqsg
