actually WP also is attractive but PAP is more centre-right which attracts me more,btohqsg

This is a joke  please don't POFMA me,btohqsg
actually i plan to join PAP to change the system slightly. to help them earn 80%+ votes,btohqsg
we are living in a too-divided society,btohqsg
more help for the marginalised but not at the expense of the growing economic pie. i subscirbe to luck egalitarianism... i got shocked when my Raffles student argued against it... =(,btohqsg
to the student  being born rich and smart is a privilege. it is unfair to level the playing field for those who are not born so fortunate. it took me some time to recompose myself to rebut him,btohqsg
i was considering joining oppo for the longest time but i am afraid that if oppo forms govt  we will pay tax  huge taxes to help the poor in a leftist system. that is okay per se but it stifles economic growth and might shrink the pie. criticise me all u want but i subscribe to trickle-down economics to an extent,btohqsg
the best way to help everyone is to ensure the middle-class and rich get to expand their wealth. then  take some piecemeal benefits (eg  taxes) from them to help the poor.,btohqsg
by supporting the rich and professionals and upper class  we generate more jobs like nurses  paralegals  accountants  cashiers  cleaners  etc. if we penalise them too much  these professionals and rich pple will leave SIngapore. then the economy shrinks. Then  how to help the poor??? basically i hope we can move forward as ONE singapore. There will always be class differences (i am slightly rightist) but lets minimise them and by the way poverty is Unacceptable.,btohqsg
"i think if PAP has more humility and transparency  they will get 80%. the way they behave in parliament sometimes is not very nice =( but who am i to tell them off? maybe i am just a ""simpleton""  (a la Lee Kuan Yew) and may change my mind if and when i become an MP. i do hope i wont lose my moral compass and always come from a position of helping people instead of being blinded by greed and dollars.",btohqsg
I like 80%. It's like A1,btohqsg
