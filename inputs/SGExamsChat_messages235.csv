Okay thats all the time i have,btohqsg
I dont want to wake up at 7 am to compete for the slot for mods,btohqsg
My course senior say NTU gives 5-10% more As,btohqsg
honestly rightid like to see a quantum physics student perform surgery,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a big fan of people,btohqsg
saying one subject is better than the other,btohqsg
i mean just let the person do whatever they wanna do not like we judging y‚Äôall also,btohqsg
sounds like the tbbt episode where sheldon was in amy's lab,btohqsg
Bio students can‚Äôt perform surgery either,btohqsg
true but what‚Äôs the point of putting one subject against another,btohqsg
just do what you like bro don‚Äôt judge,btohqsg
Felt empty now waiting for s2,btohqsg
I thought you were saying you are gonna be a secondary 2 student soonprobably not ...,btohqsg
"Hey everyone  as many of you might know  SGExams has recently registered as a society  and we continue to run different projects and operations such as our website and offline events (pre-COVID).Previously  we relied a lot on government grants to fund our projects and operations  and dug our own pockets to fund the remainder. However  going down the road  we would like to seek a more sustainable form of cash flow for funding so that we have more autonomy and ability to bring initiatives to you guys!Hence  we are looking to establish partnerships with private  for profit companies.Before  we did not allow for profit companies and entities to post as we cannot 100% ascertain their motivations behind promotion  and with that  we wanted to protect you guys from any cases of predatory advertising or posting.How this will work is that these companies will be allowed to post on our platforms for a sum of money. On our side  we will ensure that these posts are relevant and of high quality  with benefit to the SGExams community. This means no blatant ""Sign up for x course"" sort of posts  but rather posts like AMAs  FAQs or resources that will be provided to you guys. You can find an example of such a post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/e0deoi.For Tele  we are looking at portal/chat group posts for events/webinars  in addition to the items mentioned above. This list may be expandedRest assured  we will ensure that the chat group and portal remains conducive  and not spam these posts frequently.Accepting money for something like that is a huge decision that involves not just those of us managing SGExams  but you guys too. This is why we would like to find out your sentiments regarding this action. Let us know how you feel by responding to the poll below.By the way  any money that we earn will 100% go back to the society to fund events and operations  especially those that are conducted offline. We are legally required to audit and report our financial transactions every year  so rest assured that it is all being channeled back to the community aka you guys :)As for non profit organizations and individuals who are already working with us  do not fret! We will still continue working with you guys as per our agreed upon terms :) After all  giving back to the community and helping each other out is what SGExams is all about! We will make sure that everyone's interests are balanced as much as possible.Looking forward to your responses! Do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions in the comments.",btohqsg
it was just a figure of speech ahaa,btohqsg
someone said yesterday that biology wasnt as useful as physics,btohqsg
but we should stop hating on others now,btohqsg
As a 3rd year physics majorI disagree too,btohqsg
All the best for your studies.,btohqsg
I'm sorry if i said anything hurtful.,btohqsg
nono lmao i was so curious what the context was,btohqsg
I‚Äôm ok with that because SGExams is an excellent  platform. I just hope there will be a cap as to how many of such posts there will be so that posts by individuals can continue.,btohqsg
i think im more interested in how sgexams is going to price it,btohqsg
and what considers as a paid post and what is not?,btohqsg
like what will be the difference between posting as an individual representing a business but doing a personal ama,btohqsg
or doing an ama about the business,btohqsg
Hi I'm sorry if I ask in this wrong chat. But is there a smaller study group for j2 that I can join? Do PM if u have a group that dont mind me joining. Thank you for your kind attention ;),btohqsg
I think it's really on a case by base basis. if the individual ama is still promoting a paid product  or distinctly represents a brand that is for-profit  then it would be still a sponsored post.but again  rly do be case by case basis haha  q hard to give a definitive answer,btohqsg
a sponsored post will clearly be labelled to show that SGExams might benefit monetarily from any interaction you make with the post,btohqsg
what if a forprofit org does csr  maybe like employees do a push up challenge to raise funds for a charity  and promotes it in sgexams through  with various employees coming on to do AMAs and free mentoring for redditors. would that need to be paid or non paid?,btohqsg
fundamentally  it's still a for profit  so our initial stance will still be paid. however further discussions both with the partner and within the team itself could change our stance in this particular instance,btohqsg
and on a personal level  I want to remind everyone that when you donate to a company's charity drive  all you're allowing them to do is pay less taxes... better to donate directly  maybe you get tax rebates instead,btohqsg
glances at mcdonalds whenever i try to order smth from them in store,btohqsg
what abt businesses who provide services to students to raise funds for sgexams? e.g. business provide service  students pay money to sgexams for service  business don't get any money?,btohqsg
SGExams itself doesn't have plans atm to charge anyone  anything for a service that we might provide. if the business charges  and it's promoted through our platforms  a way that SGExams could earn is through a cut of their revenue,btohqsg
but SGExams itself doesn't have plans in the foreseeable future to develop any programmes that we charge students for,btohqsg
"so in this specific case  whatcouldhappen is the student pays the business for a specific service  and SGExams earns a little from the revenue as sort of a ""commission/referral fee""",btohqsg
I see  kinda interesting how sgexams is moving forward,btohqsg
internally we do have plans for events at a bigger scale  but the funds has to come from somewhere  and this is one way we figured we could raise parts of that capital,btohqsg
any sneak peak into the bigger events?,btohqsg
unfortunately not  still too early in the works for me to say anything,btohqsg
what I can say though  and this isn't an event  is that people can look forward to a refreshed look for our website,btohqsg
oh no im being judged by icedmilo,btohqsg
but if anyone got any suggestions for us to shore up our finances to bring bigger and better events... feel free to drop it here hoho I'll be here to reply :D,btohqsg
oh ya what's the running expenses of sgexams now ah?,btohqsg
in the grand scheme of things  it's notthathigh  but it's a hefty sum for one or two people to be tanking. unfortunately can't reveal specifics,btohqsg
we're always looking for ways to become more cost efficient though  and being registered with the govt has alr helped with that quite a bit,btohqsg
Guys I need some help. I wanna marie kondo my room,btohqsg
but i wanna keep all my souvenirs from my prev school,btohqsg
or yeet them into the trash?,btohqsg
like the ones u feel is most memorable,btohqsg
usually I just keep it tbh,btohqsg
maybe u can have a souvenirs box hahaha,btohqsg
i knew at sec 2 luckily i was bad at it,btohqsg
Bio got alot to memorise rite?,btohqsg
i believe it‚Äôs more of understanding concepts bah as with all other sciences,btohqsg
Ig its understanding and memorising cuz like in sec 2 I had to understand and memorise stuff also,btohqsg
But didnt rlly take bio aft sec 2,btohqsg
Oh; i took hist instead of geog,btohqsg
Ig I was lucky during o's,btohqsg
Stalin came out last yr for essay,btohqsg
I had studied for hitler or stalin,btohqsg
Its not about memo hahaah or content or understanding,btohqsg
i asked my friend what they spoke and she was like ‚Äúuhh brazilian?‚Äù,btohqsg
Yo fun fact did you know that when the portuguese colonised malacca a whole new creole was formed.,btohqsg
i do know of people that speak malayo-portuguese creole aka kristang,btohqsg
Bahasa Malaysia is the politically correct term,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite cool in malaysia actually,btohqsg
they have examination papers in both english and malay,btohqsg
sorry it wasn‚Äôt taught to me :/,btohqsg
i‚Äôm sorry if i sound racist btw,btohqsg
no la! this is just a discussion,btohqsg
yo do y‚Äôall feellike the malay word ‚Äúnyonya‚Äù is derived from the portuguese word ‚Äúdona‚Äù or the spanish word ‚Äúni√±a‚Äù?,btohqsg
I think most soccer fans should know,btohqsg
anyone knows what are the requirements to start a club in ntu?,btohqsg
though Brazilian Portuguese is slightly different from Portuguese Portuguese right üòêüòê,btohqsg
a bit like bahasa indo and bahasa malaysia I assume,btohqsg
Yay I was most likely correct :D,btohqsg
think ni√±a is a bit too far off,btohqsg
yea cos spanish not portuguese mah,btohqsg
half correct tho dona :Dstill don‚Äôt gets how the do-sound evolved into the nho-soundpardon the linguistic errors  i‚Äôm not a linguistics student so i don‚Äôt know the technical terms for these sounds.,btohqsg
damn you almost got me going down a rabbit hole,btohqsg
Can i ask a moral question,btohqsg
So i went for a korean trial class,btohqsg
"I really enjoyed myself there and I was thinking $285 was a great deal for 8 lessons with textbooks included. Dad and grandma agreed and gave me $300 for class fees. I wanted my mum's blessing but she was like ""why don't you go learn Excel or sth else that you'll def use in the workplace instead of a language you'll lose if you don't practice it""",btohqsg
so what do i do with my $300 now?,btohqsg
how is this a moral question,btohqsg
i dont wanna let my mum down,btohqsg
but im kinda sick of the whole asian parent trope she has,btohqsg
"""from the moment you chose bio over math in jc u fked up""""why are you not interested in something like tech or biz? are you scared of competing with others?""""why are you so insistent on social service/healthcare? only with money can you help others""",btohqsg
imo  she has a point  but at the same time  you should pursue what interests you. You could still learn Excel on the side. You dont need to pay $300 for an excel course that you can just learn from youtube,btohqsg
ya i wanted to tell her my school has free linkedin learning so i dont need to spend $300 to learn excel,btohqsg
she just wants you to have in demand skills la,btohqsg
imo go do both and you should be fine,btohqsg
"I honestly think this is q a common sentiment among asian parents and its a product of a different period when perhaps economic goals were imperative (rather than other goals related to self fulfillment) so I think an argument focusing on how you have your shit together may be more convincing to her  like ""I am doing X to achieve Y  mom  dw""",btohqsg
Ya I'm watching Fresh Off the Boat rn and it's relatable af.,btohqsg
So wrt learning Korean I think she'll be more accepting if you use an argument under her principles as well - for eg that Korea is a bustling economic epicentre etc,btohqsg
Lol learning Korean can help you in the workforce too. Business networking with Koreans? Probably tell your mom that.,btohqsg
anyone here went to sim biz management without a biz dip and therefore had to take a preparatory course in business? what mods did u have to take?,btohqsg
and anyway spending 300 on excel is q useless ah,btohqsg
Courses to learn knowledge not very useful. That kind can keep to free or cheap stuff. If u wanna spend  spend on courses that focus on application and practice  because that one needs active trainer support.,btohqsg
Any idea when will be the Project work result released for A level,btohqsg
How do y‚Äôall find the Application Checklist for NUS?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been digging but can‚Äôt find the form for GCE A level applicants,btohqsg
well there are some words in brazilian portuguese that have vastly different meanings in continental portuguese or are now archaic and no longer used,btohqsg
yes i can but whether the patient comes out alive is another thing,btohqsg
anyone wanna be my patient zero,btohqsg
Since i want to die i can volunteer as a test subject,btohqsg
I dont see an issue witj not coming back alive üòÇ,btohqsg
I only know there is a checklist for relevant supporting documents for NUS application  which can be found here;https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level/application-forms-and-procedures,btohqsg
They are actually quite different  yes.,btohqsg
i love the dutch loanwords ü•∞,btohqsg
Well  the Dutch did colonise them after all...,btohqsg
arbei is a loanword from dutch,btohqsg
i mean of all the things they couldborrow,btohqsg
I don't really know Bahasa Indonesia but cool,btohqsg
Btw for NUS supporting documents  how did y‚Äôall submit?,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt submitted so just wanted to check :X,btohqsg
Stack everything into one pdf  zip and upload on the supporting documents page,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no application checklist for this year,btohqsg
So just whatever else is it?,btohqsg
There is a supporting documents checklist,btohqsg
It‚Äôll show up on a Google,btohqsg
Yea but under the instructions they did mention Application Checklist which can‚Äôt be found,btohqsg
Previous years needed you to put the Application Checklist on top of everything else,btohqsg
Oh  I didn‚Äôt see that on my supporting documents checklist,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if you need to put Supporting Documents Checklist on top of your other documents,btohqsg
It was under the ‚Äústep by step‚Äù guide which I think for NUS they just didn‚Äôt bother to update,btohqsg
Oh  didn‚Äôt realise it was different,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt really make sense for it to be different though,btohqsg
They used to have this for A levels but turns out this year  they only have this for IB/International,btohqsg
Did you submit your supporting documents checklist on top of all your other documents?,btohqsg
Or did you submit the documents only?,btohqsg
I applied for NUS a few weeks ago  I only uploaded the documents they require after filling in the details and sections of the application form.,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt apply for courses this year  only scholarships  so I didn‚Äôt upload the checklist,btohqsg
Poly also have ah but dk why JC dh,btohqsg
See how the other scholarship interviews go,btohqsg
yo i'm not so sure about bell curvebut can anyone explain what it means when applied to o lvls,btohqsg
ppl talked abt it fucking up many students' grades and i got kinda confused,btohqsg
dont care so much just do your best and work hard,btohqsg
bell curve or no i wish i put in more effort into O lvls üòÉüòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
graded based on overall performance :/ üòÇ,btohqsg
same almost failed my eng üòÖ,btohqsg
then were A+ students like v affected,btohqsg
say they did rly well but bell curve pulled their marks down,btohqsg
is that how it works huh,btohqsg
Idts I not rlly sure ah but if u consistently work hard it shouldnt rlly affect u ig?,btohqsg
nono i meant like students whonormallyace their exams,btohqsg
bruh if the bell curve pulled down the marks of those who scored athat cant workbecause a is already at the top,btohqsg
they shld do well if they maintain,btohqsg
bc a lot of people were depressed abt their marks this yr (last yr o lvl students),btohqsg
2020 was a shitty yr to take o lvlsmay to august was way too chill LMAO i literally didnt start studying till 2 weeks before Os please dont be like me be like 80% of the subreddit population,btohqsg
Some ppl who had been passing emath for prelims actually failed it,btohqsg
how does that workprelims were easy?,btohqsg
there is no bell curve =.=,btohqsg
I felt my sch paper was abt the same difficulty,btohqsg
prelims is a shitty gauge for how well you'll do for Osprelims can only show where you are among your cohortTYS does the former,btohqsg
dk how many times ppl say alr,btohqsg
I got c5 for emath for prelim but later on got c6 for os,btohqsg
ohh i once read tht like prelims are harder than actual o lvls so yeah,btohqsg
But idk why but I was getting b3 for emath papers then got c6 for olvl,btohqsg
epicnow i like more scared fr o lvls lol,btohqsg
cut off for b3 emath o lvl is up to around mid 70s (around 75 or less),btohqsg
depends on your schoolfor my schoolhalf my class failed chem prelimsand everyone passed english,btohqsg
seems legitguess i just rly rly hve to practice a lot,btohqsg
good good go study !!! start earlier,btohqsg
ngl i'm months away frm o lvls and i'm scared shitless,btohqsg
months? more than half a yrbut ok,btohqsg
it felt like ystd was new yrssorry la i'm damn ded inside üò≠,btohqsg
bruh after o lvls i have half a yr till poly startseven now its about 1month till poly startsit feels like eternitymaybe because i personally didnt really have a lot going on in that 6mnths üò∂but i felt like 2020 passed by super fast,btohqsg
hell yeah 2020 went too fast bc everything i learned pretty much poofed,btohqsg
yeah i do still rmb bits and parts of it but i personally didn't think online learning was v effective,btohqsg
On the bright side we weren't tested on organic or induction,btohqsg
Just look at A math p2,btohqsg
(also im kinda forced to study abroad after o lvls so here we go),btohqsg
üëç you will feel vv good,btohqsg
OH YEA but we're adding organic back into syllabus i think,btohqsg
But the moderation for that paper was kind of a lot ngl,btohqsg
sorry i'm clueless but we can look at past o lvl papers??,btohqsg
Still remember the jackass penguins haha,btohqsg
as in one in 2020 specifically,btohqsg
i heard horror stories from the bio students,btohqsg
Yea I think it shd still be in this chats files,btohqsg
Oh yea they got tested 4 topics only rite,btohqsg
and yeah my teacher said majority cried,btohqsg
Dude you rly want amath p2 horrors just go reddit,btohqsg
Combined hist was fun as well,btohqsg
[O Levels] 4047 Additional Mathematics Paper 2 Megathreadhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jiawir/o_levels_4047_additional_mathematics_paper_2/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
ahhh i abandoned reddit and come back jus for sgexams shit,btohqsg
thanks if not   my laziness wldve overcome me lol,btohqsg
dont look at the subreddit too much or you will go crazy,btohqsg
I saved it just to remind myself how angry i was,btohqsg
Tbh it was sad and funny at the same,btohqsg
why do u do the things u do,btohqsg
any input on why i would go crazy?,btohqsg
lmao it was the darkest time of my life amath during amath p2 ü§£,btohqsg
Last year was fun. I'm gonna miss it,btohqsg
wasn't it just being held at home,btohqsg
because the subreddit is crazy99% ranting/whining posts,btohqsg
or at least those posts get upvoted the most,btohqsg
You know thrs something wrong when theres no jokes abt the papers contents,btohqsg
about the rants as someone who is going to take them,btohqsg
oh dont bother about those sad postsjust focus on yourself,btohqsg
i haven't looked at them so yea,btohqsg
I don't think u shd be too concerned since most of them are the really outliers. In any case  moderation will save u most of the time,btohqsg
Okay lah  i wont say jts that bad... But compared to almost all prelim papers  never seen one like that,btohqsg
i thought moderation would save me,btohqsg
nothing could have saved meother than myself üòÉüòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
I remember when everyone here thot u needed 90+ to get A1 for emaths,btohqsg
You problably do need close... To 90,btohqsg
my friend thst lost abt 10 marks A2,btohqsg
Mm to be frank i feel a2...,btohqsg
But amaths the score for A1 was quite low imo,btohqsg
u see  as someone who is either ignorant or clueless (feel free to pick one)  i didn't know cut off grades are diff,btohqsg
Last yrs cohort i think emath was insane lol lose 5 marks and A2. But my friend didnt account working  presentation fault. So maybe minus from that as well.,btohqsg
bruh whati definitely lost way more than 5 marksgot A2 as well,btohqsg
I think i lost 5 marks I got A1 thou,btohqsg
what in the o level marking is this,btohqsg
Still ok. Working nvr account for  so...,btohqsg
Do u feel people did worse or better than expected?,btohqsg
thats why i  say dont care so much about the detailsmake you go mad,btohqsg
Yea just do the test and forget about it,btohqsg
Amath def worse than expected LOL,btohqsg
i can't rly say much since my seniors were a mess  and when i say  mess  ‚Äî they did not know shit,btohqsg
I mean the result not the paper,btohqsg
Like after taking the paper and then seeing their results,btohqsg
Result... Eh i kinda expecred my result  so...,btohqsg
hm thanks for the warning but i kinda got myself in deep shit already,btohqsg
Still remember my friend was upset over raw 8 haha,btohqsg
At the end  i say english is what kills most people LOL. Experienced it first hand,btohqsg
Lmao first thing i saw eng b4,btohqsg
Blame it on the jackass penguins lol,btohqsg
uh on a completely diff topic  but  how can i secure a place in a poly if i'm going to study abroad for a year? (forced to),btohqsg
this is why i dont like the subredditthe people in the subreddit do too wellso many <10 l1r5i want to cry,btohqsg
what do you mean by study abroad though,btohqsg
no like  would they wait for the student to come back?,btohqsg
EAE is good if you want to chope a spot and bypass JAE,btohqsg
i'm supposedly going to a religious sch abroad for a year to ingrain somefoundationknowledge bt it's whatever,btohqsg
i think you gotta apply separately from JAE but im not too sure,btohqsg
which country? if you dont mind sharing,btohqsg
Ah Os is kinda scary haha. One bad mistake and ur score that reflects ur entire 4 years is screwed,btohqsg
emm i think u can apply for jae aft u come back?,btohqsg
give me a moment i needa look up diff between jae and eae,btohqsg
Next time go Nus/ntu/smu cannot wake up at 7 alr,btohqsg
can't exactly say that for every aspect man,btohqsg
r u going to apply for eae tho?,btohqsg
But they are of diff standards,btohqsg
True  but u can train urself to be of a higher standard if you put in the extra mile to find additional resources,btohqsg
Then that's all students can be good students  not reflective of the school,btohqsg
So I watched the first 1hr30mins then tmrw the remaining HAHHAHA,btohqsg
You should watch it. It's way better,btohqsg
Still pissed off about that subject,btohqsg
Ye and I still dunno how I didn‚Äôt even get an A2,btohqsg
For pure lit I heard that the bell curve only applies till b3?,btohqsg
My teacher said so idk if she right,btohqsg
Uhh literature is actually dang difficult to say,btohqsg
Like really really difficult to estimate,btohqsg
Because of all the different books,btohqsg
Honestly it‚Äôs a really temperamental subject,btohqsg
But the way they mark is the same ig,btohqsg
If you fail be sure your L1R5 isn‚Äôt affected,btohqsg
Ye but the difficulty of the questions for the different books,btohqsg
My literature teacher was a bloody bitch honestly,btohqsg
Felt like wasted my time focusing on it,btohqsg
Ghosted me two weeks before O levels,btohqsg
I feel like I heard that on reddit,btohqsg
Play was off centreSet text was code name verity,btohqsg
Might be the worst book I‚Äôve ever read,btohqsg
I liked the bk and it was fun to study it actually,btohqsg
Some of the guys in my class hated the book so much they still haven‚Äôt finished it,btohqsg
Just yoloed the paper then threw the book away,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt even know all the characters‚Äô names hahaha,btohqsg
Whats the storyline of the bk tho,btohqsg
Mine is abt a dystopian society where everyone is too addicted to tech and hate reading which causes like alot of conflict,btohqsg
Some bicycle shop owner‚Äôs granddaughter recruited by the British Air Force during WWII. Worked with a British royal serving as a wireless operator. Two became friends then the British royal got kidnapped by nazis. Granddaughter attempted to save her  failed and had to kill her to prevent her from being tortured by the Nazis,btohqsg
