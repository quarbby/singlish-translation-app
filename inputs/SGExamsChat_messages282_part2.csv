Depends on what you feel like..,btohqsg
True.. Distance is quite important.. Cuz you can like wake up 30 min before class and still make it in time.,btohqsg
If you choose a very far one.. 2h commute each way.,btohqsg
Hahaha.. Ride the bus or train and let it rock you to sleep.,btohqsg
2h each way ? really ?,btohqsg
About there.. If you factor waiting time..,btohqsg
Should I got for the o level overmugged,btohqsg
bruh mrt via paya lebar & bishan is not faster ? I doubt italso 168 can take from Tampines instead of bedok (EW line to Tampines then bus to woodlands) so that's 2 options ..,btohqsg
Some people just prefer one seat ride..,btohqsg
meanwhile me who changed mrt lines at woodlands  caldecott and buona Vista just to get to schooltoday 🤣🤣☠☠☠,btohqsg
Of course there is the Bedok > Paya Lebar > Caldecott option,btohqsg
How ‘s the brown line? Is it crowded?,btohqsg
wait till it connects to CBD then it gets crowded,btohqsg
Oh.. Maybe not that useful yet,btohqsg
The station ‘s already completed. Just waiting for testing and opening only.,btohqsg
nice design though  less seats more doors  slightly smaller overall compared to circle line but considering how oversi... i mean futureproofed the woodlands station is  it probably gonna be real crowded once it's fully completed,btohqsg
Is the same train as the green and red lines.,btohqsg
The sound is damn loud no?,btohqsg
They only modified the front nose and maybe the fancier looking display.,btohqsg
according to a quick search on wiki  CT251 only serves TEL,btohqsg
Hai ya who you share earpiece with ?? jk..,btohqsg
Anybody here from NP that took IMP,btohqsg
Is the same supplier. So they offer an updated version of it.,btohqsg
you are right. height width length are the same,btohqsg
higher no. of doors probably made it look smaller lol,btohqsg
But the screen is better since it ‘s from Japan rather than made in house by SMRT.,btohqsg
yeah it definitely looked great  it's one of those things where it works so well I don't notice it,btohqsg
