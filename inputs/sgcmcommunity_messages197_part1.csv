hello! if i am not eligible for pdvl  can you do grabhitch solely to cover rental?,btohqsg
anyone happen to have experience with grabhitch? ^ thanks,btohqsg
Yes. U can do hitch. 1 day 2 trip,btohqsg
Grabhitch alone cant cover rental. Max jurong to Changi 30km net $15-16ish. 2-3 trips net $30-45/day. Assuming fuel consumption 15km/l. Total 6litres. Fuel price $3x6l =$18. So $45 to cover $18. Better cover fuel price and lunch money than depend for rental cover.,btohqsg
Grabhitch only worth when its really on your way,btohqsg
Yes this. Not for you to earn one la,btohqsg
Just cover a bit of expenses only,btohqsg
Ryde up to 4 trips n abt $60 total limit,btohqsg
Or cover the day's petrol used including for own drives,btohqsg
But ur acct will be limited to 4jobs or $60/day,btohqsg
And u can only take rydeflash  rydepet n rydeshre,btohqsg
U have any experience with ryde? Easy to get trips?,btohqsg

Carens n mazda 5 nt really suitable if ferrying 6 or 7 pax. Wish is the cheapest follow by serena and lastly oddy. If short means 1 or 2 yrs... better spend a bit more get oddy. Less chance of it being phv and mileage tempered,btohqsg

Kia Carens and Mazda 5 Suitability: Both the Kia Carens and Mazda 5 are designed to accommodate 6 or 7 passengers. While they might be smaller compared to larger MPVs  they are still practical for short-term use and urban driving. They offer reasonable comfort and versatility  which makes them suitable for ferrying passengers.Toyota Wish Affordability: The Toyota Wish is indeed an affordable option. It is well-regarded for its reliability  fuel efficiency  and practicality. It can serve as a cost-effective choice for those looking to transport multiple passengers.Nissan Serena: The Serena is known for its spacious interior and comfort. It is a mid-range option in terms of pricing and offers ample room for 7 passengers. Its features and reliability make it a solid choice for family or business use.Honda Odyssey Cost: While the Honda Odyssey is a premium MPV with excellent features and comfort  it comes at a higher price point. For short-term use (1 or 2 years)  investing in a more expensive vehicle may not be the most cost-effective decision  especially if budget constraints are a consideration.Mileage Concerns: The likelihood of a vehicle being a former PHV (private hire vehicle) with tempered mileage can vary across models. While higher-end models like the Odyssey might be less commonly used as PHVs  proper due diligence such as checking service records and vehicle history should be done for any used car  regardless of the model.In summary  while the Honda Odyssey offers superior features  for short-term use  the Kia Carens  Mazda 5  Toyota Wish  and Nissan Serena remain viable and more budget-friendly options. The decision should balance cost  reliability  and specific needs for passenger transport.,btohqsg
This chatgpt kinda... out of touch with our mkt,btohqsg
Serena and oddy same depre at 20k...,btohqsg
cannot trust chatgpt all the time. it can spew out bs but make it seem legit,btohqsg
Oh  absolutely. Because clearly  in a market where space is at a premium and practicality is key  the suggestion that the Nissan Serena  known for its spaciousness and practicality  and the Honda Odyssey  renowned for its luxury  aren't suitable choices if they have the same depreciation rate of $20k is just so off the mark. And yes  heaven forbid we consider the fact that both the Kia Carens and Mazda 5  which are perfectly capable of ferrying 6-7 passengers  might actually be suitable and cost-effective options for short-term use. Clearly  anyone suggesting otherwise must be completely out of touch.,btohqsg
"Oh  I totally get it. Why trust a language model that uses data  logic  and context to provide informed answers when you can just go with gut feelings and half-baked assumptions? Clearly  all those facts and well-reasoned arguments are just smoke and mirrors. And hey  it's not like cross-referencing multiple sources and critically evaluating information is something anyone should bother with  right? Much better to just dismiss anything that doesn't fit your preconceptions as ""bs.""",btohqsg
