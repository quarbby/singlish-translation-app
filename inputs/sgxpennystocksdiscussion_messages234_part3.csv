Fine him to buy more moyaüòÜ,btohqsg
All Counters please close well for next week. Thanks BBs,btohqsg
The last time round HS Optimus gap up from 0.005/0.006 to open 0.008/0.009 at a period where Oceanus performed well too. Then it retraced with selling down and then stopped at 0.005/0.006. Have noticed that $0.005 had buyers but to collect there seemed difficult. Yesterday HSO had announcement of a Substantial shareholder Mr Lee Han Peng buying 888 lots at $0.005. In some way  $0.005 would be a psychological support as this Mr LHP although private and anonymous  i assume has financial backing as he already holds 13% of HSO. Looks like upside possible with the way Oceanus inch up slowly and considering that they are the micro penny leader. Good luck and DYODD,btohqsg
