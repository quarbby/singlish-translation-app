Pika World Daily Update Aug 31  2021Equity Markets on the MixThe US market had a rough ride as market participants focused on Friday's incoming August's job report.The market is generally well supported  giving that Uncle Powell had given assurance to the market on Friday that the Fed isn't near anytime soon to raise rates despite tapering on the horizon. This had given support caps like Russell 2000 on Friday  which had risen sharply  paring some gains on Monday.Technology stocks gave S&P 500 and Nasdaq a big lift. According to FactSet  only about 51% of the S&P 500 had risen  signally a narrowing breadth of strength. Nevertheless  the outperformance of the tech sector had lifted the index to a new high.The Implication on Friday‚Äôs Job ReportPika World sees the August payroll report on Friday as the key highlight for the week. It will allow investors to understand how some early termination of the unemployment benefits may drive workers back to work.Unemployment benefits will end on Sept 6. Hence  the full report of labour health as a macro view can be observed when we reviewed the October data.Although we want to see a healthy labour force  the swift recovery has negative implication to the stock market. Economists are generally looking for 750 000 jobs in August  and any upside surprise could fasten the pace of tapering and add pressure to the current rally.SEC to consider Ban for Order FlowRobinhood had a rough start for the week. This is after a controversial practice by brokers is expected to be terminated by the SEC that will dent the income streams of brokers.The idea of payment for order flow is that brokers like Robinhood tend to send in trade orders to market makers who will execute those trades and receive a portion of the profits in return. Such a way of conducting business appear to have some level of conflict of interest.First  market makers receive the share of profit from the trade  they also receive the data  and with the early information  they can match buyers and sellers out of the order flow  which may not provide an efficient market.What's on the Menu Today?At 9.45 pm  we will receive the Chicago PMI data for Aug which is expected to fall to 68.0 from the prior period of 73.4.At 10pm  the CB Consumer Confidence is expected to moderate to 124.0 from 129.1 level.It is on Aug 31  Tuesday  8.50 am in Singapore and 8.50 pm in New York. It is the last trading of the month  and we look forward to a good closing for August as it had been a marvelous ride.,btohqsg

Soros Warns Against Buying Into Rebound: What to Watch in China2021-08-31 00:24:24.499 GMTBy Richard Frost(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire George Soros has a blunt warningfor investors tempted to bargain hunt in beaten-down Chineseshares: don‚Äôt do it.While China has faced numerous difficulties in the past andalways comes through it  Xi Jinping‚Äôs increasing strangleholdover private enterprise means this time is different  Soroswrote in a column published in the Financial Times Tuesday  atleast his second op-ed on China this month. ‚ÄúInvestors buyinginto the rally are facing a rude awakening.‚ÄùXi ‚Äúis putting in place an updated version of Mao Zedong‚Äôsparty ‚Äù Soros wrote. ‚ÄúNo investor has any experience of thatChina because there were no stock markets in Mao‚Äôs time.‚Äù(China‚Äôs equity market reopened in 1990 after being closed 40years earlier following the Communist revolution.)Buying the dip in Chinese stocks has been a tricky strategysince February  with no rebound lasting long enough for the HangSeng China Enterprises Index to rise more than 7.5% from troughto peak. The gauge  which tracks 50 Chinese companies listed inHong Kong  is this year‚Äôs worst performer among 92 benchmarkstracked by Bloomberg  down 16%. Sentiment remains so fragilethat its stocks are trading at less than book value on a weeklybasis  the lowest multiple since early 2016.Soros called for U.S. Congress to pass a bill that wouldforce asset managers to only invest in companies withtransparent governance structures that are aligned withshareholders. This would limit passive flows into Chinese stocksvia benchmark indexes because  according to Soros  ‚Äúpower andaccountability is now exercised by one man who is notaccountable to any international authority.‚Äù‚ÄúIf Congress were to enact these measures  it would givethe Securities and Exchange Commission the tools it needs toprotect American investors  including those who are unaware ofowning Chinese stocks and Chinese shell companies ‚Äù Soros wrote.Why China and U.S. Are Clashing Over Stock Listings:QuickTakeWhile Soros has long been vocal about China  describinghimself an outspoken opponent of what he calls a totalitarianregime under Xi  that hadn‚Äôt stopped his firm from investing inthe country‚Äôs shares.Soros Fund Management snapped up Chinese shares sold off inmassive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang‚Äôs ArchegosCapital Management  before exiting the positions earlier thismonth. The family office sold $194.3 million of ViacomCBS  $77million of Baidu shares and $46.4 million of stock in Vipshop according to a regulatory filing. Soros Fund Management alsoliquidated positions in Tencent Music Entertainment.Soros is best known for his large bets against currencies including a position shorting the British pound which made hishedge fund $1 billion in the 1990s. He also profited bettingagainst the Thai baht during the Asian financial crisis  andmore recently against the Japanese yen in 2012 and 2013.To contact the reporter on this story:Richard Frost in Hong Kong atrfrost4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Michael Patterson atmpatterson10@bloomberg.netSofia Horta e CostaTo view this story in Bloomberg click here:https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QYOEDUDWX2PSThanks & Regards Mabel ChowVice PresidentCentral ExecutionCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd(Co.

Wow 2014  back then the crash killed me badly.,btohqsg
what was the takeaway? What took you from there to become the person you are today?,btohqsg
Back then too naive  it was really easy to win as market was hot during ABL rally. I think many would have been easily carried away.Ultimately  I did not practice any form of Stop Loss then and that is what killed me painfully .That is why  I used to provide daily quotes with reminder on the importance of Stop Loss because you can win many trades but all you need is one wrong trade which you are big in and failed to stop loss  maybe even continue to average in to really wipe you bad.Hence  Stop Loss guys. It is very easily to get carried away in a good market. I believe many were caught and stucked in some counters this 2 years  but if really no hope. best to cut and look for the right one to win back and get back to track man.Use the bullets wisely. Unless of course you have too much bullets ahahha,btohqsg
you are seasoned player too. even posting on social media on stocks and the ABL since 2014. Power,btohqsg
Yea revenge man  Blumont have quite a lot of collection already. Lets hope they really try to lead man. $0.004  i'm in Q since last week never got any filled. Earlier saw 0.005 clearing  added some. :) Try Try,btohqsg

Guys! Is it true SG gov is invested in Pfizer/Moderna?,btohqsg
i think temasek got invest in pfizer,btohqsg
Won‚Äôt be surprised Hai Di Lao founder may get targetted as well,btohqsg
was in news like long time ago,btohqsg
Wow! Then isn't this a conflict of interest?!?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so.. coz boss his Singaporean now,btohqsg
i think is like temasek so like a proxy,btohqsg
Buy shares and then keep pushing vaccination,btohqsg
Depending temasek holding how many share..,btohqsg
No . Tencent Hong Kong chiong after new announced üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
So... If I understand this correctly... SG uses taxpayers' money to invest in vaccine producers... Use taxpayers' money to buy vaccines  and give taxpayers max 4% (mostly just 2.5%) return for that particular year?,btohqsg
US market still not the great performance..,btohqsg
From what I see.. pifzer not in list Temask holding ..,btohqsg
My teacher ask me shot oil price when hit 72 to 73,btohqsg

1 billion is nothing in US üòÇ,btohqsg
This is 25 top share holder company Pfizer,btohqsg
Maybe this do some research n database..,btohqsg
This gov very smart! Taxpayer is the risk taker and profit ownself take,btohqsg
I mean in long term.. taxpayers still get 4% rather then 0 .. since can‚Äôt do anything.. at least my point is still positive in the long run..,btohqsg
Any new Vaccine.. sg will get first.. compare Malaysian.. what the gov done..,btohqsg
Malaysia EPF one of the worst  buy stock then lend out for ppl to short. Glove community will know what I mean.,btohqsg
You do realize these 4% and 2.5% are never guaranteed for the long term  right? Just need a parliamentary 'debate' to adjust (down),btohqsg
So if the government bet wrongly and lost  can just come up with valid reasons to reduce interest rates,btohqsg
Are you just depending this interest for the long run.. 2.5 or 4%.. still have interest.. at least gov did used the money.. vaccinations 1st delivery to SG..,btohqsg
Not putting any hope on these money... Not even sure when the musical chair will stop,btohqsg
Bonus if anything comes out of it... But not depending on any,btohqsg

Pika World Update- 1 September 2021A good Run for AugustWhat is seen as a typically weak season ends well for the equity market. However  the stocks generally ended lower on Tuesday due to signs of weaker growth in China and some level of inflation seen in Europe.The focus continues to be on economic data  given that the manufacturing and non-manufacturing data from China had fallen more than anticipated. On a side note  the S&P 500 had a great year as it registered the seventh straight monthly gain.Best performer includes those of value-oriented sectors that are well received in the maturity of life cycles and have some level of sensitivity towards the cyclical demand.Could September be a Curse yet again?Stock markets usually have a rough September. Yet  many analysts believe this year could be different. Based on historical data since 1928  when the S&P 500 had risen by more than 13% in the first half of the year  the index tends to have a median return of 1.4% in September.Whether this remains true  we shall observe.PayPal: A New Driver in TradingThe company is working on the development of its app to allow for stock trading. This will essentially put pressure on a trading platform like Robinhood Markets. Robinhood shares have fallen drastically after the news. Other lousy information continued to pile up  such as the desire by the SEC Chairman to ban payment for order flow  a source of lucrative income for the company.Paypal news should not come as a surprise given that in the early year  they had a hint on exploring stock trading in their platform. This is likely to happen in 2022  as the company explores ways to engage consumers' wallets better and attract more funds into their ecosystem.What's on the Menu Today?At 8.15 pm  we will receive the ADP Nonfarm Employment  which we expect a jump to 613K from 330K in the prior period.When the clock hit 10 pm  ISM Manufacturing PMI is expected to moderate to 58.6 from 59.5 in the prior period.This week's attention and focus are on Friday's job data  and we expect volatility to remain grounded.It is 1 September  Wednesday  8 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a splendid start to the first day of the trading month.,btohqsg
