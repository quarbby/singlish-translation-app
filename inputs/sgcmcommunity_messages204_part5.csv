Spend 5-6k on a TV to watch Channel 8,btohqsg
In SG  the younger ones who are more tech savvy  those are the ones who are in the high adoption rate. Older folks tend who are more prudent tend to be spend less on these thus fall into the low adoption rate.The much older folks will want to be in their comfort zone  so won't even bother with new tech. Not all grand parents are willing to learn new tech stuff. It's only a small handful that willing try to learn.,btohqsg
It's for those who have 'disposable income' to splurge on it. Just like ladies who purchase branded handbags to put their tissue paper & phone in.,btohqsg
Buy tech to showoff only  but never use,btohqsg

It's a different group (Malaysia LTA). Oh well...,btohqsg
