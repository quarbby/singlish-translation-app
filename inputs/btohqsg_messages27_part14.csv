Seems no amenities also. More ulu than taman.,btohqsg
hello! just hoping for some input - we were just given an appointment date on 18 Dec for June 2024 BTO  but we also applied for Oct 2024 BTO under MCPS. Does HDB give allowance and give non-selection waiver if we get a better queue number under the Oct 2024 sales exercise?ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Non selection waiver is only if there are 10 units and less when it comes to your appt to select flat,btohqsg
OCTâ€™s Ballot results maybe not out yet by your appt dateâ€¦,btohqsg
whats ur queue for june and which project did you apply in oct? did u use mcps for june?,btohqsg
This is tricky question. 18 December the Oct ballot result may or may not be released yet,btohqsg
If it is released and like what she said she got a good queue number,btohqsg
Then I am not sure hdb handle it,btohqsg
If by your selection  you still have more than 10 units to select from  you have to select a unit.If less than 10  you can forfeit without penalty.Penalty is: All ballots on hand immediately cancelled and become 2nd timer status in ballot for one year.,btohqsg
Means there no such thing as waiver for better queue no. As long the appt you can ballot   you have to,btohqsg
The only way you can waive for non selection is if your Appt on 18 Dec   there are only 10 or less units left to select,btohqsg
right  guess it's just wait and see if Oct results are already released by the appointment date. if yes then can at least write in and appeal to HDB if MCPS gives us a better queue. Otherwise it's select unit (if >10 units left for ethnic quota) or reject and become 2nd timer with the Oct 2024 application cancelled also. Thanks everyone!,btohqsg
feels like we're a little stuck cause the drop out rate for June project is starting to climb already hahaha. left with undesirable units in front of rubbish chute ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Your appt is 2 weeks time. There is still a chance for the remaining units to get taken up. In that case then you don't even have to go for the appt,btohqsg
You should check the units available prior to your appt and the ethnic quota as well,btohqsg
looks like no chance although they might back more appointments subsequently,btohqsg
still got chance >10 units in 2 weeks' time... that's why feel quite stuck haha,btohqsg
can check last queue of the day by logging in,btohqsg
which project is that.. you are lucky to get an in supply queue.. it is also in line with hdb's policy of dont anyhow apply if not ready to commit to it,btohqsg
about 300+ haha. hopefully racial quota run out first,btohqsg
Don't worry so much. My queue number was 569/297 for Teban project June BTO. HDB contacted me to go appt for this Friday as well. There were 20 units left. However  within the next 3 working days  all 20 units were sold. No need to go appt .,btohqsg
true  we are lucky to even be invited! the Oct project we applied for is at least close to one set of parents so if can get better queue for that project then we'd prefer that honestly  parents getting older also,btohqsg
June project is better for us location wise if we just focus on our nuclear family,btohqsg
If your queue number is far away  like my situation  all units could be sold before your appt. You should check the units and quota prior to your appt,btohqsg
Hi  is the HLE valid only for 9months?If we apply by 15 Dec  the validity period would not cover until 2025 Oct BTO application.Am i Right?,btohqsg
Ya. But can reapply one week before it expires. Btw itâ€™s called HFE now,btohqsg
There's an admin fee?So we pay twice for 1 year's try.Also pay for BTO application.,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think thereâ€™s admin fee. Only when apply BTO den got application fee,btohqsg
Hiii  my hfe is expiring on 20 Dec. Can I renew it or I have to reapply HFE?,btohqsg
Only one week before it expires  then there will be renew button? As I currently can't find any renew button.,btohqsg
Currently I login  it says1. View hfe letter2. Reapply HFE,btohqsg
You have to re apply a new HFE. Enter all information again. There is no renew,btohqsg
Just like how you do it the first time,btohqsg
Anyone knows for single   the price for that unit in the website is included 15k or not? I read somewhere that it is already included?,btohqsg
I read thru the whole discussion. I suggest that u join or check Marsiling Peak telegram group  then u will know that 16 Dec is for it  as there's a queue number tracker there which will show that people around your q number of 625 get the similar appointment date.,btohqsg
"No offense but I think the term you used  such as ""rejected""  ""rebook"" etc may not the best term as they caused the confusion. I guess the whole scenario is like this: u applied June woodlands Bto  got queue number of 625 out of 606 (out of supply  but this is not ""rejected"" or ""failed"" )  then u applied for Oct BTO  applicants with in-supply queue of 606 or less is not allowed to apply for Oct BTO. Somehow for unknown reason  HDB rejected your Oct BTO application or it simply stated that you not eligible. Maybe you asked HDB to check n thereafter HDB asked you to ""reapply"" Oct BTO (not ""rebook"") and you reapplied successfully.",btohqsg
You have two BTO applications currently right? Maybe you can share with us how your HDB dashboard looks like? How one can proceed/click correctly to view the status/ballot results/appts for each BTO application? So not to confuse the result/appt of one application with the other application,btohqsg
No  the June application my Q was 569/297. HDB later sent me invitation to select flat for the last 20 units   but they were all taken up. So the application in the dashboard shows Cancelled,btohqsg
Oh... But before HDB cancelled your June Bto application  could you see the two applications simultaneously?,btohqsg
You can see all your applications,btohqsg
Even the SBF application in Feb   it is still in my dashboadd,btohqsg
That's whereTeleshould correctly click to proceed to view result of his/her individual application right? I,btohqsg
Yes. Basically you click Proceed for that particular application to see,btohqsg
Every application you did will appear in your dashboard,btohqsg
