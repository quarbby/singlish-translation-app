We are doing him a service,btohqsg
John must be protected at all costs,btohqsg
If my poly asks me to get a 16GB ram laptop  can i get a 32 GB ones instead? Cause itâ€™s faster,btohqsg
You can get 32GB one if you have the budget,btohqsg
Ohhh okay thank you guys so much !!,btohqsg
And also  they ask for an identification when im checking out. What identifications do i put?,btohqsg
But this year no self collection tho,btohqsg
U hang a board on ur neck say its me,btohqsg
"Just upload a word file saying ""u will know when u see me""",btohqsg
That time you ordered your laptop  you put your ic ah,btohqsg
Later they sell to some black market,btohqsg
Erm more ram just means more program running at once. Doesn't mean faster. If you do coding you need cpu  not ram,btohqsg
I have 16gb and I don't remember ever crossing the 10gb mark,btohqsg
32gb here and I frequently pass 16gb,btohqsg
depends on what you doing lmao,btohqsg
for poly students  this would depend on what course you're going into,btohqsg
I think Firefox just keeps all the tabs in ram,btohqsg
Hhh what course are u in,btohqsg
Oops I meant when u are in poly,btohqsg
with Pr and all my other crap it routinely goes up to >20gb,btohqsg
Browsers have a tendency to scale it's mem usage to Max available ram,btohqsg
Maybe it's just me who don't really use apps hhh,btohqsg
I just use PC for coding that's all,btohqsg
but if you're like me and u have a crapton of taps open at once and you don't want to lag like shit  you'll need more RAM,btohqsg
my second comp is dying with just like 5 tabs open  4gb RAM,btohqsg
Ur crap ton really means a crap ton hhhh,btohqsg
I have 80 open and it just gets to 12 gb,btohqsg
It's just how browsers use mem yeah,btohqsg
then when u go back they just reload,btohqsg
Chrome is a piece of shit,btohqsg
That's why I still use it,btohqsg
I think it's the fully spec one,btohqsg
6300 is trash  6600 still ok,btohqsg
6600 still not that bad what,btohqsg
Bought it for the pen support,btohqsg
Means I bought the surfacebook for nothing lol,btohqsg
Hhh I need more cores in my brain than in pc,btohqsg
Brain not scaling well to school,btohqsg
surfacebook was never a very good value,btohqsg
Got fully speced out one at 2k,btohqsg
Still. Doesn't matter once I get the ipad,btohqsg
"The last time I tried to bruteforce the number of ways 'Y' can come after the vowels in the word ""TYRANNOSAURUS""  i ran out of ram",btohqsg

Oh wait this doesnâ€™t use a dic,btohqsg
Plus overheads of silly python i was way over 16gb,btohqsg
How in the world does the program uses ram,btohqsg

Ah good times at NUS CS,btohqsg

Scares the shit out of me,btohqsg
Times at NUS CS and USP more fun tho,btohqsg
USP replaces the university general electives?,btohqsg
A good way to balance out the types of knowledge learnt,btohqsg
Please donâ€™t do law plus USP though,btohqsg
Which halls are affliated with usp?,btohqsg
Lmao it's funny how i don't know this despite being year 3,btohqsg
All the rc's and special programs,btohqsg

Ochem is a pain in the a,btohqsg
"I guess I'll be 40 by the time I'll be a ""successful"" doctor",btohqsg
And my friends would already have grandkids,btohqsg
I'll be lonely till 40 wohoo,btohqsg
No need to marry if u never meet someone with whom u wanna settle down,btohqsg
I think I'll be a permanent patient before becoming a doctor,btohqsg
No  even better  having children but not living together and not marrying.,btohqsg
You can just get a dog no?,btohqsg
I have a fucked up view of relationships right now,btohqsg
Before I reconcile that view I won't consider marrying,btohqsg
My dog died two years ago and I can't find a space in my heart for another one,btohqsg
They are damnn scary yo I have had phobia for cats since I was little,btohqsg
Those creepy eyes really scares the crap out of me,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚u might have just angered a whole bunch of feline lovers,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ its scary only for me tho cats can be really evil at times also no offence yall,btohqsg
Cats are getting popular nowadays I wonder why,btohqsg
Dunno. Always liked dogs more than cats,btohqsg
Why in the world would I want to be treated as a servant to a cat after a long day of work,btohqsg
Ehh same yoo I wish I had a talking parrot,btohqsg
Get a pet to feel good not to get bullied,btohqsg
Nah just don't like them. Apathetic creatures,btohqsg
I made a song about you  kim,btohqsg
Is it they wanna you to follow their footsteps or cos they poor that's why overcompensate by asking you to do something they can't,btohqsg
Become lawyer or doctor also slog,btohqsg
im no good at law (my parents know) and i didnt take chem,btohqsg
they want me to take comp sci,btohqsg
i also want to take comp sci,btohqsg
but i know my results cmi,btohqsg
Why must all successful ppl become lawyer doctor hm,btohqsg
so i want to put other safe choices beyond first,btohqsg
What's the big deal about those jobs,btohqsg
but they dont like those choices,btohqsg
Literally 1010  2030 wrecks ur brain,btohqsg
but they want me to put all 4 dpt of comp sci into the 8 choices,btohqsg
You prob would have gotten any other courses that's not cs,btohqsg
My crush's dad is a banker,btohqsg
Sia la I no need know about your crushðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Is anyone having trouble with ochem alevels,btohqsg
I've had a severe headache after reading through first few line of a particular chapter,btohqsg
If you really feel like crying and you can't read ochem,btohqsg
only way to do ochem is to try to memorise the reagents and conditions  and practice till u can apply to context,btohqsg
if ur having a headache go rest first  no point cramming if ur not in the best state to cram,btohqsg
Honestly cramming is easier than knowing a hundred eqn but not knowing how to start,btohqsg
Thanks for the advices guys... Been tough lately,btohqsg
Itâ€™s normal to not understand just by reading,btohqsg
Listen to lectures  go for consults,btohqsg
No need wait liao I quit nus already,btohqsg
does anyone have a list on what to submit to your polytechnic ?,btohqsg
don't just memorise the mechanism  try to understand the mechanism and the concepts behind it if can,btohqsg
memorising can get you far but understanding is what gets u the A,btohqsg
Memorising the exam also gets the A,btohqsg
I mean  that's literally the goal of doing all questions in the TYS,btohqsg
If you really wanted to understand you'd do only 1 paper and screw the rest.,btohqsg
haha i came to realize the importance of understanding concepts when i went beyond sch test,btohqsg
honestly understanding is just as impt for chem,btohqsg
considering how they like to throw in application questions for ochem,btohqsg
anyone from nus? Can I check sth: if im offered merit scholarship  do I still have a chance of getting the global merit scholarship? (they didn't invite me for any interview etc.  so I'm confused how they made the decision),btohqsg
isnt nus scholarship application open till nxt week or smth,btohqsg
Sometimes yeah  I heard of people getting offered on the spot,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve never heard of people getting accepted without interview though  but I guess maybe thatâ€™s possible,btohqsg
he is a solid individual worthy of scholarship,btohqsg
I just saw this in the fine print,btohqsg
Please note that you may still be considered for the Global Merit Scholarship and may be contacted by the faculty for an interview between now and May 2020. If you do not hear from us by May 2020  this will be the finalized offer.,btohqsg
lol im applying for it now and the process rly sian,btohqsg
Got it mate imma crush this ochem once and for all,btohqsg
hope you can find patterns between the mechanisms to help u understand btr hehe,btohqsg
Might as well ask for the whole application,btohqsg
90rp will offer on the spot,btohqsg
But i never see before global merit scholars they r like unicorns lol,btohqsg
Unless u like represent sg or smth,btohqsg
And u founded a million dollar coy i think they will give u global merit,btohqsg
wah so hard to get one ah,btohqsg
90rp is not a good indicator of success in uni anyway,btohqsg
my batch got someone 87.5 rp global merit engineering scholar,btohqsg
welp I got go intl comp but nv win anyt la LOL,btohqsg
hello can I ask for sit 72rp info security what are the chances of getting in,btohqsg
Are you within 2.5rp of the 10th percentile IGP?,btohqsg
"Also  will knowing the ""actual"" answer change your choice ranking?",btohqsg
Just put it on your choice list if you want to get in,btohqsg
Not like your choices will change even if it's a very low chance right,btohqsg
hmm but I heard that people with very low rank points of 50 plus and 60 plus can get in so maybe I have a chance?,btohqsg
i tried looking on online forums for the approx rp required but mostly is all gpa:/,btohqsg
ya i heard only 20% of sit students are jc grads,btohqsg
Hmm I was from SIT before going to NUS,btohqsg
Depends which course.. it's like tri-mester,btohqsg
But u can potentially grad faster ah,btohqsg
If you need your summer holis. SIT abit challenging  (subjected to type of course),btohqsg
hm i am aiming for info security which is 4 years I think,btohqsg
Oh wassup ur my primary sch mate,btohqsg
We can do forest w friends,btohqsg
Iirc there was this forest group a while back but idk if its still active,btohqsg
Should do a bit of scambating,btohqsg
Some aspire to go to Harvard,btohqsg
The MIT aspirers are mugging not screwing around on a telegram chat,btohqsg
Never have I been offended by something I completely agree with,btohqsg
Hahahaha I'm at cam and got accepted at stan,btohqsg
I'm still here chilling from time to time,btohqsg
Chill guys MIT people have to chill at some time yeah,btohqsg
MIT is much more selective than Cambridge if Iâ€™m not wrong,btohqsg
But I canâ€™t say anything about Stanford cause I have no knowledge about US,btohqsg
when someone hits you with a stick thats the sound you make,btohqsg
Their acceptance rate is higher cos of self selection,btohqsg
Ppl from MIT come Cambridge get wrecked,btohqsg
Go back complain to their school,btohqsg
Now all the stem ppl at cam know MIT ppl are pussies,btohqsg
Go ask around if u have friends at MIT or cam,btohqsg
Oops have I offended the mit folks,btohqsg
None here as far as Iâ€™m aware,btohqsg
Could have.. I better siam in case they come smack me,btohqsg
Cross the ocean just to smack you,btohqsg
Or using it when you don't really know what to say but have to say something at the very least?,btohqsg
These definitions online just got me twisted,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s a possible function of the word,btohqsg
"I see. And they said it also means ""wow"" but in a neg way",btohqsg
Like when someone tells you something bad happened to them,btohqsg
oof came from roblox dying ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hmm I think I'm a 'scientist' and I'm like the least successful in my family RIP,btohqsg
Not sure who from MIT would go Cambridge - they are different universities and do  generally  different things.,btohqsg
Lol nobody cares about grades on exchange - all exchanges are for traveling,btohqsg
Nope for Cam and MIT students,btohqsg
It's very easy to compare Cambridge and MIT,btohqsg
Also dunno why you are comparing on that basis,btohqsg
Clearly according to your god(awful?) wisdom  Cambridge people are superior in every manner  born of the most chads of chads  while MIT people suffer stunted growth in every manner,btohqsg
Oh lol do I need to specify that's it's the mit undergrad who went for exchange for undergrad cam,btohqsg
The stem ppl at cam thinks that way. I just happen to voice out their thoughts,btohqsg
No you need to specify that all UK people are superior  hence Brexit so they may start some kind of Queen's supremacy,btohqsg
FWIW (almost) all '4G' ministers in SG come from Cambridge,btohqsg
Lol continue ur reductio ad absurdum and do ur strawman argument,btohqsg
If you want to stir shit,btohqsg
Don't stir shit and disown it,btohqsg
I stir liao then u unhappy for what,btohqsg
What in the world u wanna prove,btohqsg
I want to prove that  IF I CAN DO IT  YOU CAN DO IT TOO,btohqsg
Therefore  we should all do NDU Hell Week together!,btohqsg
Don't get the flow of argument,btohqsg
Sorry xiaodi dumb don't understand sarcasm,btohqsg
People needing to claim their superiority and/or laughing at people.,btohqsg
Huh. I clearly said that that's what cam ppl think. It's not as if I went to MIT myself,btohqsg
Who is that 'people' u referring to?,btohqsg
U feel that saying people pussy indicates superiority is it. Then u rightðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You should code in an rpi that plays the 'achievement unlocked' thing,btohqsg
I've been buying a lot of rpi,btohqsg
Go US only know how study,btohqsg
I make alot of Random shit,btohqsg
Oops somehow fly away liao where's the shit,btohqsg

It's not like the group isn't public already,btohqsg
Public group boy  you might get arrested if you confess here,btohqsg
There were some files leaked on the internet,btohqsg
That's where I found this group,btohqsg
Singapore has no jurisdiction over the crimes he's commiting in Msia,btohqsg
Nothing will happen to him if they cant find any evidence,btohqsg
And if its very long ago  unlikely as well,btohqsg
I'm not staying in Malaysia anymore,btohqsg
Or if they donâ€™t even know who he is,btohqsg
Uni seniors  would you advise a Y1 to spend their summer on an internship or running FOC?,btohqsg
Im not in Uni  but ive seen uni students do summer jobs before. I think its a really good opportunity for you to learn.,btohqsg
What kind of internship? What role do you play in FOC?,btohqsg
hey  is there a Telegram group for part time jobs? plz tag me one,btohqsg
Cos I think advertising not allowed  but itâ€™s not mine,btohqsg
Just PM it to him lmfao,btohqsg
@teojianrongSorry but we donâ€™t allow survey posts on here because too many can clog the group  try going to the surveys section in our discord counterpart instead,btohqsg
I think do summer job ba,btohqsg
Helps in the long run. Interviews are brutal at year 3. Prep early,btohqsg
I think@Hamsomy3should be more than ok with interviews,btohqsg
John Smith knows me so well,btohqsg

Screenshot didnt exist back then sorry no archives,btohqsg
I knew the Illuminati would have my back,btohqsg
just curious to see what they have atm,btohqsg
always go for internships whenever possible if you wanna be competitive,btohqsg
unlikely companies will pick y1s up thoughusually y2s,btohqsg
Any bedok viewian will be ashamed to put it in their LinkedIn profile,btohqsg
But some Bedok viewians are fine putting it as their telegram/discord name,btohqsg
What if there's an ulterior motive behind it,btohqsg
So youâ€™re saying heâ€™s pretending to be a Bedok viewian to ruin Bedok Viewâ€™s reputation,btohqsg
Or what if he/she/it(delete where applicable) is actually a bedok viewian,btohqsg
But motive behind it is unknown,btohqsg
To tarnish the school rep?To promote the school?,btohqsg
Guys  how do y'all write personal statement?,btohqsg
