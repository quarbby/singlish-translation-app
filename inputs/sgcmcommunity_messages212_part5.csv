Workshop tht deals w Conti have very sharp knives,btohqsg
Peugeot  Citroen  Opel r the contis to avoid,btohqsg
A hint to know whether these cars have good resale values (and hence good reliability  demand  etc) is to monitor the Sgcarmart resale market list.,btohqsg
Y not if the price is right,btohqsg
Sometimes the premium u spent on jap cars is more than enuf to overhaul the Citroen or Opel engine n gb,btohqsg
thanks for the information  Ill try to look around more,btohqsg
Depends on luck. My Peugeot 308sw 1.2 Pure tech which I bought new in 2017 has been pretty reliable after 7.5 years ownership. This is the main reason why I'm resisting the urge to change car  as this Peugeot is giving me only 9+k depre annually.,btohqsg
your toto luck all in your car liao,btohqsg

This is true. I see some PARF Opel cars with depreciation around 8.5k or lower. It's like getting a car & a 15k++ repair budget when compared to similar age jap cars.,btohqsg

Owned a 308 1.2 and Astra 1.4 before  both actually served me quite well without any major issues. Peugeot and opel are not as unreliable as one might thought in today’s age. Only thing is no resale value.,btohqsg
Exactly. I would say it’s the old way of thinking; technology has really caught up now. As recently as about 10+ years ago  many people were hesitant to buy Korean cars but they are equally reliable,btohqsg
If buying Opel or Astra new then it's less riskier as the condition of the car is up to you. But OP was asking about 2nd hand cars. 2nd hand cars has the unknown risk of poor maintenance from previous owners. If things go south  it will be tougher to source parts and labour knowhow for these brands vs Honda or Toyota.,btohqsg
Both i owned were 2nd hand too. Commonly used parts are not hard to find  stockists do carry them locally. End of the day  it boils down to luck whether the car behaves well or not 😬,btohqsg
And of cos  do your due diligence send the car for PPI before deciding to buy the car or not,btohqsg
Hmmm.. what is your opinion of parf Opel diesel cars. Aiming for 3 to 4 year remaining COE cars. Diesel depreciation is quiet good since can get back more money at deregistering.,btohqsg
I wouldn’t be able to comment for diesel cars unfortunately 😅 no experience with it. But diesel is expensive in sg  road tax also higher. Is it worth it?,btohqsg
If drive a lot then yes,btohqsg
You save more in the long run,btohqsg
My 116d had 900+ for a 50l tank,btohqsg
But ah.... step all the way down no feel,btohqsg
Enjoy the pickup can liao 😂,btohqsg
No doubt toyota is tank. Just sharing my experience with the “unreliable” brands,btohqsg
Yeah. I am including total life time road tax cost into the car cost. It would still come out cheaper than petrol cars. My mileage won't be that high actually. So probably nil in fuel savings.,btohqsg
If the car is not common on our roads  imagine getting parts for them,btohqsg
Anyways diesel road tax is not worth it. Ur paying close to a Cat B for a cat A diesel,btohqsg
Hello - i wanted to check.I am in process of buying a 2nd hand Mercedes ev. Fairly young unit still under warranty with c&c.Wanna arrange a pre purchase inspection - any recommendations?,btohqsg
Just for my curiosity  What are you expecting to find? The car seems to be a fairly new EV with warranty remaining.I heard STA is the standard pre-purchase vehicle inspection option that many dealers agree to. I think this should be sufficient for a young EV.,btohqsg
You got check if the warranty follow car or follow owner?,btohqsg
And whether the servicing with c&c was followed thru by previous owner,btohqsg
What will ur boss do if every day u drive a brand new different limited edition super sports car to work?,btohqsg

Still not as expensive as ev road tax,btohqsg
Plus ev no parf or little parf at the end,btohqsg
all these parf and road tax are just one part of the equation. There is no point to analyze them individually. Prudent way is to just arrive at an all inclusive 10 year cost and then compare the pros and cons in terms of drivability features etc. 10 yr cost is fuel cost based on est mileage  road tax  insurance  price of car  estimated repair spare parts cost  repair and maintainrncr cost per year (lower for EV) and finally parf rebate at 10th year etc..,btohqsg
This is because new ev doesn't have arf  so what you dun pay in the beginning  you dun get back in the end,btohqsg
