They didn't mentioned in their profit guidance announcement right,btohqsg
U work at night or monitoring US mkt overnight? If not  no reason to sleep.,btohqsg
Will they be selling on news ? Feels like run up a bit in the morning and sell down.,btohqsg
KGI Research starts InnoTek at 'outperform' with TP of 73 centshttps://t.co/4KspAXUlfO,btohqsg
HC Surgical Specialists reports H1 net profit of S$5m  buoyed by fair-value gainhttps://ift.tt/2XBavhrJanuary 13  2021 at 07:43PM,btohqsg
Still very cheap compared to Int. Cement,btohqsg
My call on GKE to collect before the run was 85 . During that point they already give profit guidance.Price went up quite a lot since then.I would be wary for new traders although my side still have long term position inside .Always be wary and protect your hard earned money.,btohqsg
For easy reference. Bingo except wrong about dividends,btohqsg
GKE looks good. There are buyers.  My stand is the same (83-85) good price to collect and hope some have collected with me.  Anyways  if buy  make sure it can hold  not suitable for contra play yet. Looks like the BBs are accumulating. I see this breaking the recent high especially during the upcoming results announcement (HY2021) . The recent profit guidance announced on 30th Nov 2020 mentioned that they will be recording a higher net profit as compared to the previous period. Fingers crossed but i will not be surprised if they announce a dividend too. (the last dividend was back in 2016) Lets see. Good luck and DYODD.Do read up on the recent 2 announcements. In my opinion  it is very positive for the company.,btohqsg
Broadway look boring after the announcement for sale of hdd business,btohqsg
Avarga and vp also look boring at first for few month . Now suddenly crazy üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
You bought 154 .. 157 ENOUGH ? You must be bought at least more than 100 lot to see profit üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
If the hdd disposal proceed  Broadway becomes a cash company with nta about 16+ cts. That's why the price hard to go above this level.,btohqsg
Expecting a long candle üïØ coming for BW.Same type of movement as what Yinda and GKE did before they took off,btohqsg
To settle in green without paying is good enough for me,btohqsg
Anyway I expect to lose ip softcom,btohqsg
artivision daystill at w4but now is more ready to move up,btohqsg
Today Artivision T+4   those contra who bought 11 on Last Thursday also managed to sell back at same price 11  only lose comms.This is a good indication of strength in this counter.We should know soon enough.,btohqsg
Long candle? ü§îü§î Maybe must hit 0.170 to hit a long long candle,btohqsg
Yup I expect that candle to come.I hope I am right. I really do.Nothing is for certain. Only time will tell.If 149 & 150 breaks without buyers pouring in then SL for me.,btohqsg
What is the SL expected ? ü§î,btohqsg
