yes. the cards setting page is exactly the same for both trust link and  trust cashback. i actually have no idea if it is even in debit or credit card mode,btohqsg
is trust link card supposed to be in 'debit card' mode by default if i have the cashback card?,btohqsg
Under Trust link card there's a pairing setting. If you don't see it then the next question is  do you have a Trust bank savings account in the first place?,btohqsg
yes.. i have savings account as well (0 balance though  not sure if it affects),btohqsg
i have all 3 products.1. savings a/c2. cashback card3. link card,btohqsg
Confirm can access the savings account?,btohqsg
i have not tried using the savings account before. but i do see it on my app with the a/c number displayed,btohqsg
Which means you can see the options like View card  PayNow  Statements  etc right? Once you tap on View card  you'll see the option to pair.,btohqsg
yep everything is there. my account is just 0 balance,btohqsg
The card details page can't screenshot. You have to just tap the View card button and pair to savings account.,btohqsg
Probably check if you can access your savings account first  else see if you've updated your app. Else look for CSO le.,btohqsg
Wonder why can‚Äôt use Mb f&f  directly when using Kris+ dining?,btohqsg
Hihi‚Ä¶ What about using Citi rewards cc to top up grab?,btohqsg

Can I check if i use citi rewards oversea for hotel bill do I get 0.4 miles or 1 miles or 0 miles per dollar spend,btohqsg

On the topic of paying school fees  is it better to pay off educ fees by cpf or pay it via CCs?,btohqsg
If your cash flow is sufficient never touch your CPF.Use credit card (Chocolate for example) to pay school fees.CPF leave in account at 2.5% pa risk free.,btohqsg
but can easily get more than 2.5% elsewhere?,btohqsg
My fee 6k first installment.. i planning credit card,btohqsg
Any card good to use and earn point ah for credit,btohqsg
Last month I used Chocolate Finance Card via AXS and managed to earn about 28K miles.  Since AXS no longer accepts Chocolate card  what other way can I earn miles.  I have another $18k due at the end of this month.,btohqsg

UOB preferred plat visa - can I earn miles if I‚Äôm booking hotel online?,btohqsg
Wow. You pay $66k via AXS?,btohqsg

I spent more on other cards like UOB lady  UOB PPV and UOB VS. UOB prvi only 2k.,btohqsg
Choco card no longer accepted at AXS?,btohqsg
They have a bank run going on now,btohqsg
Is the trust invest good ?,btohqsg
chocolatw finance mini bank run is happening pls go withdraw,btohqsg
As much as I don't like how Choco fin handles AXS drama  asking people to mass withdraw is gonna make matter worse.,btohqsg
Not sustainable  probably massive liquidity crunch now  given they likely hold most asset at high yield investment  if they are forced to withdraw now confirm GG. Recall Silicon Valley bank‚Äôs collapse,btohqsg
I use Maybank family and friends card in Malaysia  won't be charged additional foreign transaction fee meh?,btohqsg
Fees are about 3.5%. Cashback is at 8%. Better than those almost fee-free alternatives,btohqsg
They might be sketchy with what they've done  but this is just pure malice.,btohqsg
Userjusamanhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:malicious intent,btohqsg
I disagree with advocating/instigating a bank run. But CF is not a bank  the only reason people put money in their money account is because of trust  trust that they will not run away with our money (since not SDIC insured).A lie about the CF card being blocked from use by AXS is a lie  and this erodes away the trust that users have in CF.They should have calculated their own risk before pulling a stunt like that to us.,btohqsg
Let's Talk About Chocolate Finance (CF)Preface:Since my video on 11 Dec 2024  I‚Äôve been transparent about not having funds in CF  as I found better alternatives with higher returns. Source:https://youtu.be/9SukDSNAzKo?si=wRFrZxBWQdhGKRFr&t=535Recently  there‚Äôs been some controversy surrounding CF. Let‚Äôs break down the facts.Timeline of Events* 5 Mar 2025 (Wed):  CF updated its FAQ  stating that AXS no longer accepts CF Debit Card payments. They were in discussions to resolve the issue.* 7 Mar 2025 (Fri):  Reports emerged that AXS clarified CF itself requested to halt payments  and AXS simply complied.* 9 Mar 2025 (Sun) ‚Äì Present:  Various creators shared their opinions on CF  which may/may not have influenced many users to start withdrawing their funds.* 10 Mar 2025 (Mon):  CF is now experiencing temporary delays for instant withdrawals.My Thoughts‚ùì Do I like what I‚Äôm seeing? ‚ùå Absolutely not. This is a PR disaster and a potential loss of trust among current and future customers.‚ùì What am I doing now? üîπ Nothing. I haven‚Äôt had funds in CF since Dec 2024  and I‚Äôve already made my stance clear.At the end of the day  when situations like this arise  it‚Äôs crucial to do your own due diligence. No one cares more about your money than you do. Stay safe and make the best decisions for yourself.,btohqsg
work for me leh. I instant withdrew $500 Sunday night. Not a big fund though..,btohqsg
In the event that they do collapse *touch wood*  is it right to assume that the market money funds that were not withdrawn could be inherited by another financial institution and customers won‚Äôt be impacted?,btohqsg
Hi any experts here can advise on scb personal loan? Interest rate 1.9% and Eir is 3.63%.Compared to car loan at 3.18%  eir not sure but shd be higher than 3.63%  will personal loan be a better option?,btohqsg
For a 20k to 30k loan,btohqsg
If sign up through singsaver  got cash rebate $600 for 30k loan,btohqsg
where do u see this? can share link ?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  what's your take on car loan  personal loan  or cash payment  for a car 20k to 30k,btohqsg
Only if the Benefits outweigh the cost (E.I.R. Effective interest rate),btohqsg
Btw I dont own a car  so have to ask the car owners here,btohqsg
Honestly they feel damn sketchy since day 1 üòÖ their platform on and off down for no particular reasons at times.,btohqsg
Anyone able to withdraw the amaze wallet amount to bank yet?,btohqsg
not yet.. i also waiting to cash out my $20.. haha,btohqsg
cf cant seem to pay for sbux drink today lol  kept declining the card,btohqsg
Seems like not only instant withdrawals affected ü§™,btohqsg
IMPORTANT:Instant withdrawals are temporarily unavailable. However  you can still withdraw your money during this period via the standard process of selling your investments  which typically takes 3‚Äì6 business days. Please note that this process may take longer if the withdrawal is made shortly after adding funds to your account. Additionally  once a withdrawal is confirmed  it cannot be cancelled.If immediate access isn‚Äôt required  you may prefer to wait until instant withdrawals are back up and running. We‚Äôre actively working to restore this service as quickly as possible and appreciate your understanding.,btohqsg
hahah but went to cold storage to get water and payment went thruüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
my friend got 600k in CF..,btohqsg
RIP. I thought the 137k one was worse. Don't even get why anyone put more than 30k tho.,btohqsg
haha but choc finance say even if they toh  funds are save,btohqsg
At least he helped 30 pax to withdraw their funds üòÖ,btohqsg
GG  this is giving me FTX vibesüò≠,btohqsg
MAS will bail chocolate finance out‚Ä¶ too many users will lose money. They are too big too fail,btohqsg
honglim park will get pack again,btohqsg
Final withdrawal amount we receive may differ,btohqsg
Quite normal from all robo advisor withdrawals  no?,btohqsg
How about the top-up programme that CF offers? Does it still stand?,btohqsg
I think as loyal CF users  we should not panic and withdraw our funds hastily. Show your support and leave your money there so platform can run smoothly. After all this  maybe got give extra chocolate for us loyal users! üç´,btohqsg
The problem is even if you don‚Äôt panic and withdraw  others will. So it makes no difference,btohqsg
Now I cannot use the card; the transaction was rejected.,btohqsg
If CF has 10000000 users  i am one of themIf CF has 10000 users  I am one of themIf CF has 1 user  that is meIf CF has 0 user  then I am dead.If the world is against CF  then I am against the world.,btohqsg
Why would you put 600k in CF? Are their returns so good?,btohqsg
maybe got presbyopia  saw it as CPF,btohqsg
Maybe the guy has more than 100 mil networth. 600k is less than 1%,btohqsg
I wanna withdraw my money from CF but the app ask me to verify my bank account by transferring some money to themI paynow them 1cent just to fulfill their request.Now  how long will they take to verify my bank account and then allow me to withdraw?.,btohqsg
Deposit is instant u can check in app its already done,btohqsg
If you paynow  you need to use ur bank app instead of paylah/googlepay. I did 10$ transfer and it was fine. You can try smaller amount.  The activation should be instant.,btohqsg
Siao man... i got my cc bills to pay in 5 days time... now this cf need process ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

Guys i very worried about CF. I put all my funds in üòÇ,btohqsg
Should I initiate a withdraw now and wait for 10 days?,btohqsg
u initiate withdrawal now then wait 10 days to get back. Its not wait 10 days then can instant withdrawal,btohqsg
So I should just continue fund it?,btohqsg
dont continue fund it for now,btohqsg
Yes this was what I did too,btohqsg
Anyone encounter transaction declined for chocolate card?,btohqsg
yea all this discussed above. u can scroll up to read,btohqsg
If you are eligible for solitaire then go for solitaire with the  category you select,btohqsg
Same. Decided to just withdraw my money since card cannot use.,btohqsg
Not sure instant withdrawal will be available by then,btohqsg
Yes.. there‚Äôs risk if I don‚Äôt withdraw now don‚Äôt know wait until how long,btohqsg
Cannot pay cannot withdraw. What is wrong with them?,btohqsg
read above. u can scroll up to read bro.,btohqsg
Just initiated a transfer with CF. See if funds reaches me within 10 business days,btohqsg
For what? Because they maybe enable instant and screw over those waiting?,btohqsg
Because if u withdraw now  the amount may differ.,btohqsg
Hopefully below 20k can get full amount since I understand above 50k is subjected to market movement (not guaranteed interest),btohqsg
Thanks a lot for the response. Much appreciated,btohqsg
Thanks for that. I‚Äôve read the requirements as well,btohqsg

Still don‚Äôt know what card to use to replace Amaze‚Ä¶ any recommended?,btohqsg
Better withdraw any amount in CF to be safe,btohqsg
1% only for offline transaction. U will need them for other online transactions and overseas.,btohqsg
There is charge for overseas usage,btohqsg
If you care about absolute cost  other cards are better. Crmc + amaze is balanced between cost and miles earned.,btohqsg
There is 1% for LOCAL SGD transaction. Even if online,btohqsg
Train payment still works for CF,btohqsg
My bad in reference to crmc + amaze  we should unlink all apps with amaze so then it wont incur the 1% . Direct to crmc card,btohqsg
Seems like can't even log in to CF liao... Anyone else?,btohqsg
Can ah.. relax la dont be led by a 15k subs youtuber.,btohqsg

hello  can anyone help me with comparison btwn UOB krisflyer and UOB prvimiles? Looking to use it as general spend card after other cards.1) Leaning towards prvimiles as not very interested in locking in on krisflyer only and also because it will pool with other uob cards.2) krisflyer card need 800 spend on the few specific before earning 3mpd.3) krisflyer card converts to miles instantly hence faster expiry.so uhm what pros are there for krisflyer over prvi?,btohqsg
say bigger ticket stuff? bc will have citirewards for online  dbs wmmc for travel,btohqsg

Then you are not new already,btohqsg

Do you mean that there‚Äôs no 1% charge for specific mcc? üôè,btohqsg
no charge for declined transactions (for now),btohqsg
Lock your amaze card in apps before payment,btohqsg
I applied uob ladies. I gotten a sms saying Your UOB Card/CashPlus application is successful. Your new card(s) will be sent within the next few days. Please call UOB Customer Service for other queries.How do I access the uob app for now?,btohqsg

CF bank run liao. When all promote chocolate finance good yet each time all these recommendations end up causing people to have money stuck in the account. Cannot withdraw already.Previously I also trusted all these content creator like ftx  hodlnaut  anchor protocol. End up all run. But our money gone.While these creators already earned a ton of referral fees. This is so shady.,btohqsg
for uob  usually is 6 months prior to whatever promotion. Will state in T&C,btohqsg
2 days ago CF allow withdrawal.,btohqsg
"It's better to wait for the instant withdrawal to be back before withdrawing. Else there will be a ""wait time"" where your money is not earning interest.",btohqsg
Just made payment and can use,btohqsg
oooh shall try to make a payment as well,btohqsg

For public transport  amaze will not charge the 1%  am I right?,btohqsg
If yes. Then I‚Äôll replace SC Smart with Amaze for public transport.,btohqsg
For public transport they charge you 50 cents every $15 you clock lol,btohqsg
How did you come to this conclusion(my keyboard autocorrected to concussion at first  which is also somehow accurate...),btohqsg
Saving accounts. SSB. Tbills.Oh cpf üòÅ,btohqsg
But sc smart has min spending of $800,btohqsg

This should have been the there since the beginning of axs removal.Unless who started the fire puts down the fire  it's tough.,btohqsg
hope he can keep his word,btohqsg
i only wanted them to keep their BIG BIG ADVERTISEMENT of 2 miles per dollar for AXS payments.. at least for a few months la.. not just one month..zzzzzz,btohqsg
survive first and then think about better lifeüòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs too good to be true to last any longer la üòÖ,btohqsg
They clearly underestimated the amount of BILLS we can pay!! lol,btohqsg
but how can they NOT know this? they should already have factored in the cost of 2k miles per user per monthanyway.. that is what? $40 per user per month assuming 2 cents per max mile,btohqsg
I am not able to pay bills with my CF debit card,btohqsg
My CF debit card not working since noon.,btohqsg
I still got 100sgd in chocolate financeüòÇ,btohqsg
The debit card still can use on transport,btohqsg
I feel they completely underestimated just how many transactions would happen on the card  even excluding AXS. What‚Äôs annoying for me is I‚Äôd rather they have a separate account for linked card  that pays no or little interest  so it‚Äôs always liquid. Card disruption is just so bad for customer confidence  especially when the machine tells me ‚Äúno funds available‚Äù FML. All my bills are set to chocolate card  so do I have to reset? How long the disruption for card users will be? No answers at all from them üòë,btohqsg
They are not aware how many loopholes AXS has,btohqsg
They should have started with a small group of users for trial first,btohqsg
I'm just wondering if withdraw now  the 3 to 10days wait does it mean we can still surely get our money back?,btohqsg
have no other option but trust them,btohqsg
so far all pointers given is that it will come back,btohqsg
May I know what happen to chocolate finance? I see rumours at xhs. Is it still safe to put $$$ in there?,btohqsg
Use the debit card better. You don't get interest during the wait.,btohqsg
no bank run? they need to issue POFMA to business times thenhttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/chocolate-finance-suspends-instant-withdrawals-due-high-demand?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social-organicAccording to a notice on the Chocolate Finance mobile app on Monday (Mar 10)  the platform is currently experiencing an unusually high volume of withdrawal requests  in what is likely to be Singapore‚Äôs first bank run of a platform-based financial services company.,btohqsg

Does this mean out wait for money back might not go through?,btohqsg

Does anyone have the same problem as me that I can‚Äôt link my bank account to chocolate finance to withdraw my money,btohqsg
People are not withdrawing because it's not safe. People are withdrawing because of the loss in trust in the company's words.,btohqsg
Why u sound like binance CZ lol,btohqsg
i remember HODLNAUT CEO also said this before,btohqsg
Hodlnaut was a Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading platform which collapsed when the TerraUSD (also known as UST) lost its peg to the US Dollar. The loss of the peg resulted in Hodlnaut's holdings dropping by almost 70% overnight  and the collapse of the platform.Its not even the same thing ü§°,btohqsg
it will be same if in the end people cant withdraw their fund,btohqsg
Thanks for replying.. don‚Äôt want to have salary credit and credit card spend. Is only excess cash and need liquidity for down payment on next housing as currently looking for one.,btohqsg

The guy clearly underestimated axs payment. Instead of capping axs rewards to 1k  he chose to axe it and not communicate to users  blame it on axs. üòÖ,btohqsg

What‚Äôs this game on the miles system Walter was talking about?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone familiar with ocbc 360 save bonus criteria. I read an article somewhere that we should top up $520 on D1 of the month and ensure they are no further transaction for the rest of the month in order to entitled the save money. However if your salary is credited on a certain day  just ensure it is withdraw out on the same day before 9pm. Just nice my salary and ocbc bonus was credited in on the 11th last month and I withdraw them all out before 9pm. Called customer service a few days ltr to check and end up have to top up even more than what I withdrew. Anyone can explain whyyyy üòë,btohqsg
And can advised when would be the best time for me withdraw both my salary and ocbc bonus interest if both happen around 11-12th of the month.,btohqsg
I think the cso smoked you. Wat you are doing seems fine.,btohqsg
Top up 520 on the first day of the month  then do not touch the account for the rest of the month( ie don't withdraw  and if there is deposit( such as int   pay etc)  withdraw it out on the same day b4 9 pm to be safe),btohqsg
The solution is to use another card that gives rewards for that transaction lol,btohqsg
can check on ocbc ibanking instead of calling customer service,btohqsg
If you spend 100 $10 transactions  it's 5%. If you spend 1000 $1 transactions  it's 50%.,btohqsg
lol we all know the true reason why people are withdrawing. It‚Äôs not like if the programme is communicated honestly  100% of money w CF are for AXS or spends through debit cardThis article isn‚Äôt helping at all,btohqsg
Like ur $4.05 dinner  you just paid 12.3% in fees,btohqsg
Yeah  saw a random fee incurred. Panicked,btohqsg
You should catch up on this nerf from amaze and look for alternatives.,btohqsg
Just nice i just hit the next 25000 block of points for CR.,btohqsg

Felt like the CEO worded it to give reassurances to future customers while burning bridges with all existing customers...Little does he know the current customers are probably the more money-savvy and tech-savvy ones who will ditch the platform after being treated terribly like this.,btohqsg
Very terrible public relations if you ask me.,btohqsg
No point gunning for future customers if majority of existing customers leave and it collapses.,btohqsg
no miles pay ipaymy  right ?,btohqsg
They cancelled the AXS pay for AXS. Maybe they spoiling the payment market,btohqsg
Like how BYD spoiling American car market,btohqsg
Is it worth to use Citi Rewards card for my overseas online transactions for the 4mpd? Understand there is some fees for foreign ccy  but is it still worth the 4mpd? Or am I better off with 1.6% Cashback? I spend at least $3k on overseas online transactions every month. What other cards do you reccomend? My transactions are not under Shopping category.,btohqsg
Ok but Citi rewards card max $1k a month. What other cards can I use?,btohqsg

I use Choco debit for 2mpd max $1kCiti rewards and amaze for 4mpd max $1kTrust cc or Citi Cashback plus for cashback $rest of it,btohqsg
They specifically said they suspending the card because you are self-employed?,btohqsg
Based upon your latest income details submitted to Trust  you do not meet the minimum income criteria to qualify for an unsecured credit card.Idk where they get my income details from. Maybe my cpf,btohqsg
This was when you applying for the card or you already have the card?,btohqsg
I apply the card 1 year ago and has been using it no problem. When I applied  I had a full time job. Only few months ago I change to self employed. I didn't submit new income details nor declare I'm self employed,btohqsg
If I remember correctly  Trust checks credit every month. So not sure what other checks they can do.,btohqsg
I pay my credit card on time also... My Citibank and Maybank cc got approved while I'm self employed. So idkk... Now looking for alternativesPerhaps my spending of few k every month and not full time employed triggered their system,btohqsg
Omg first time I hear a cc company will conduct active credit checks while already using the card,btohqsg
Is fine they don't want me as their customer.... Lol....,btohqsg
For UOB privi miles  which should you choose? visa  master or AMEX?,btohqsg

They were new back then. They need to be more conservative and ensure the portfolio remains healthy. Monitor red flags more closelyBefore finding out too late that the portfolio turning bad and have to close the CC business.So nothing crazy about checking monthly.,btohqsg

Hi guys  if a merchant allows Kris pay  and I am planning to use UOB privi miles to pay just to clock my welcome offer spent.I will just be able to claim whatever perks the Kris pay miles to dollar right? No issue with that?,btohqsg
Krispay Miles rewarded can only be used to offset spending at a Kris+ merchant at a ratio of 150 KPM to $1. The extra KPM 'earned' via the bonus earnrate at Kris+ merchants can be transferred to Krisflyer though.,btohqsg
1.5% cashback without FCY is ofc the best  but the question is you are no longer a Trust Cashback cardholder  then it boils down to are you in the miles accumulating game or value cashback more?,btohqsg

hi gurus  now that the citi rewards + amaze strategy has been nerfed  what are your new strategies or cards for general spending?,btohqsg
I don't get what you mean by salary come in already leave enough for +500..,btohqsg
If you have 100k now  the easiest is just deposit 100k  and when salary credit just transfer out your salary? I'm assuming you are depositing 100k on the day of opening.,btohqsg
100ksalary comes in then becomes say 110k.then i withdraw 9500 become 10500,btohqsg
What is your purpose? Your MAB in Feb is $0.,btohqsg
need increase saving by 500 right?,btohqsg
for next month i should do that?,btohqsg
1st month confirmed higher than last month monthly average balance of $0,btohqsg
Next month you deposit $500 on the first day and withdraw your salary the exact same day it's credited. If it comes in at 8am  do it at 8:01am  if it comes in at 8pm  do it at 8:01pm.,btohqsg
deposit 500 more than last month MAB on the 1st of month if it is mon to sat and not public holiday. If sunday or public holiday need to recalculate how much to deposit on  the following weekday.,btohqsg
Will I be charged FCY fee if i cancel the transaction but the refund only come in 2 weeks?,btohqsg
does ocbc tell u ur last month mab? or need track yoself,btohqsg
depends if transaction is void or refunded,btohqsg
Example if I just only spend 4k a year for uob ladies. Then probably 10k for uob Visa. Do I even get waive for the uob ladies?,btohqsg
should be ok  worst case cancel card and uni$ will retain if u have other uni$ earning card,btohqsg
Just worry my spending is not enough for waive,btohqsg
just cancel card is they dun waive annual fees. Nothing much to worry about,btohqsg

Sorry gurus I would like to ask please does uob lady's card 1000 spending for 4mpd goes by calendar month or statement month please?,btohqsg
How come I see on the ocbc the MAB is above 500 for this month.. but didn't get the bonus today?,btohqsg
Is the MAB there for next month interest bonus?,btohqsg
What you are seeing on the website is the mab for the current month compared to the last month.,btohqsg
Thank you guru for the reply. I was searching the wrong wordings. Now I need to find another card to book my hotels.,btohqsg
The MAB on the current month vs last month is not the correct indicator to use?,btohqsg
Provided your account balance remains constant in previous month.If you have few credit n debit transactions in previous  topup $520 will not work.Ocbc uses current month MAB to compare against previous month MAB  but not compare to the closing balance of last day of previous month.,btohqsg
How soon can I apply for UOB PPV and UOB VS?Just applied for UOB privi miles today to claim some sign up bonus so thinking when would be a good idea to apply the rest of the card.,btohqsg
If you are not in a rush to use those cards  id suggest spacing them out  every other month for example,btohqsg
Actually in a rush haha have a few big ticket items to pay within the next two weeks‚Ä¶ any advice would be appreciated,btohqsg
So this is not accurate? It stated > 500 already though..,btohqsg
Uob has this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù to deduct your uni$ then refund them with new expiry date so you get extension for free ish,btohqsg
If not I will just leverage on other cards  if it‚Äôs risky to apply all at one go,btohqsg
If you are asking why you were not given the interest today  you should be comparing last month mab to the month before,btohqsg
What is the amount? Maybe make use of other banks‚Äô signup bonuses,btohqsg
13k in total  current plan is to use my wife‚Äôs PPV  VS  we have 2 amaze x CRMC and with the privi miles can only clear 7k.Got another 6k don‚Äôt know how to clock.For context all this big ticket items are from gain city  wells and four star mattress,btohqsg
The savings bonus would be given the following month not in the same month,btohqsg
Tried $250 was declined  then use multiple $249,btohqsg
So can i say the indicator now on the web is for next month interest to be credited?,btohqsg
You must make sure it stays at above 500 for the whole of march,btohqsg
Can PPV earn 4mpd when booking air tickets or hotels ?,btohqsg
If by April somehow it dropped below  it won't affect right?,btohqsg
Amaze has additional 1% charge you may want to consider.,btohqsg
It would only affect the bonus in May,btohqsg
Yeah don‚Äôt mind paying the $10 charge just to clock the 4mpd,btohqsg
Actually if you guys already have the uob cards  you can probably try applying for the rest of the cards? It should be approved pretty quickly.,btohqsg
Yeah my wife is currently a UOB holder so banking on her PPV and VS to come fast. But I‚Äôm a new user so I believe it‚Äôs gonna take awhile,btohqsg
do you guys have dbs? DBS altitude for SUB then DBS WWMC for 1 500$ cap spend for those items can be bought online,btohqsg
We‚Äôre DBS card holders too. None are online unfortunately all is instore hence the limbo,btohqsg
Also applied for a Maybank F&F since I will need to start using it anyway but wise to clock 1.3k to earn the sign up bonus of a luggage instead of miles?,btohqsg
My answer is for Grace‚Äôs question. I m not sure what is your question. So can‚Äôt give you an answer.,btohqsg
If going to spend $1k on food in a single transaction  which card would you recommend?- Maybank f&f is out cos‚Äô cap is $312.50,btohqsg
whack 1 and for all amex plat charge ü§©ü§©,btohqsg
Also a Amex plat holder Liao but gonna cancel in July ü§£,btohqsg
I'm still noob but what about getting vouchers from heymax to spend in store?,btohqsg
Think it‚Äôs wise to get the ascend? Cause seems like existing holder still can get some bonus,btohqsg
She is a sub under me  but currently she owns a true cashback on her own.,btohqsg
My bad gain city is not in,btohqsg
Any good OCBC card? That one we confirm not a holder,btohqsg
current plat charge has signup bonus for existing amex card holder. 90k miles for 8k spend. You can refer your wife so you can get some $ and your wife gets 100$ credit.,btohqsg
Yeah but the 1.7k hard to swallow ü§£ I paid once enough Liao.Sorry  my questions feel kinda tough‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt plan early enough keep on procrastinating haha,btohqsg
Actually if you do not mind lesser miles  maybe can consider uob kf,btohqsg
Oh sorry maybe that is online,btohqsg
@RyanWayneeAtome?https://www.atome.sg/en-sg/paylater-merchants/gain-cityThen can add DBS wwmc  HSBC revo,btohqsg
I would like to check on OCBC 360.Eg: I have 45K in my account in Jan I did received my SAVE & SALARY bonus for Dec credited in Jan. In the mth of Jan I withdrew 15K out for investment which leaves me with 30K balance. At the end of Jan I did credit my $1800 min requirement and have the $500 increment. But on my Feb transaction  I was only credited SALARY bonus. Why is that so? Same for March (Just checked)Must it be I have to have 45k + 500 to qualify for the save bonus?,btohqsg
OCBC rewards cap spend is 1000? Can it be paid at gain city to earn the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Your mab for Jan should be 44.5k and above I guess,btohqsg
Yup looks like wells and four star also on atome. If cashier nice maybe they let u split atome and paywave,btohqsg
2 % rebate on top of 1OCBC$ every dollar spend at best denkihttps://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/rewards-card#:~:text=The%20maximum%20bonus%20OCBC%24%20you%20can%20earn%20a%20month%20is%2010%2C000.&text=We%20will%20award%20OCBC%24%20in S%245%20for%20each%20transaction.,btohqsg
got multiple items so i dont see why not,btohqsg
Ah so the plan is to add WWMC to atome and pay via atome? What is the cap? Is it 1.5k?,btohqsg
can add crmc also  hsbc revo,btohqsg
1.5k so max is 4.5k bill. You 1 account and your wife 1 account can settle 9k.,btohqsg

Average for previous and current month,btohqsg
1. no 1% charge for fcy spends but 1k for crmc 4mpd2. 1k limit for chocolate 2mpd no matter what spend,btohqsg
So instant withdrawals will eventually return?,btohqsg
I think so  they just need a few days to liquidate their funds to restore their liquidity pool,btohqsg
im keeping my expectation low for chocolate finance,btohqsg
Oh ok thanks! Seems like that kinda solve the issue. But isn‚Äôt atome splitting your total bill into 3 months? I shouldn‚Äôt do that and just pay lump sum right?,btohqsg
in your case isn't it better to spread to a few months? essentially  your max cap is increased to 3 months worth,btohqsg
atom splits your bill into 3 portions so you can pay in 3 months. I just rememberhttps://help.atome.sg/hc/en-gb/articles/4403090262681-What-is-my-spending-limitAtome has limit to 3k transaction amount on cc. So only 3k bill per atome usage ,btohqsg
Ah that‚Äôs true  sorry haven‚Äôt use atome in a long while but I always thought ‚ÄúIPP‚Äù doesn‚Äôt earn you points so under the impression that if I do that I won‚Äôt get my miles,btohqsg
bank ipp (usually 6  12  24 month) no  atome is different (buy now pay later),btohqsg
Actually in my experience  I suspect if your singpass income is a certain level  this limit is also increased,btohqsg
Tomorrow is 3 days since the initial pause right? So hopefully some who withdrew early Monday should be processed? Fingers crossed,btohqsg
i researched this cuz last time my amaze got declined with reason ‚Äúnot enough limit‚Äù or something similar. Amaze is classified as debit card.,btohqsg
Ah Okok that clears up the confusion thank you! In this case  cause I‚Äôm also an old holder of the Citi rewards Visa card as well.Would it be ideal if I just spend 3k (split in 3 months) on my Citi rewards visa? So it‚Äôs 1k per month which maxed out my online spend for the card?,btohqsg
Does atome classify as online spend?,btohqsg
I will caution you that somehow citibank visa cards (crv  smrt) don't see atome as online spend. Citibank master cards are online for atome,btohqsg
data from our dear@jmthamthat atome does not get points for citi rewards visa so better not,btohqsg
Oh ok ok then to play safe I just use my Citi rewards master card,btohqsg
I heard similar stories for citi rewards master so dbs wwmc (or hsbc revo) is a safer bet,btohqsg
I personally have charged my atome to crmc and its ok,btohqsg
Thanks both for your help  basically the most urgent one is paying a 3.5k AC bill from gain city so that gain city can arrange for pipping works to be done.The rest prolly can wait for card approved then settle.,btohqsg
Manually charge it or auto deduction?,btohqsg
Oh gain city very flexible with how you pay the bill hahahaha. U can use your crv with shopback  then split a bit onto atome  then paywave  should be ok,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I earn 4 mpd on Turkish airline tickets using UOB ladies travel category?,btohqsg
Oh so Citi rewards visa with ShopBack also works?,btohqsg
Heard tomorrow will start receiving in bank for some.,btohqsg
So if  3.5k bill$500 via ShopBack pay (Citi rewards visa)3k via atome split 3 months (Citi rewards master card)That would solve the entire issue with 4mpd online shopping?,btohqsg
Does uob prvi card earn 2.4miles when paying overseas hotel on the spot?,btohqsg

If on 31 Mar for some reason you withdraw until MAB increase is dropped below $500 then you will lose this month's save bonus.,btohqsg
Hope OCBC 360 is not your primary bank account for interest since you seem to have a lot of movements and you have below 75k. Else is going to be a meagre 2.65% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
When people stop withdrawing  then probably will return. Now they have to sell the fund holdings before transferring the money.,btohqsg
3 to 6 business days  the earliest I give also Thursday or Friday.,btohqsg
As long not through AXS and up to $250 per transaction (there is dp that shows $250 also cannot  $249 can).,btohqsg
I believe you registered via SMS ¬†in Feb  5+ weeks ago. Search SMS 74722 (the day you sent) or HSBC-Retail (the day you received notification). Yesterday SMS from HSBCSG is just a reminder to increase your fund in March so that you can get 2.9%.,btohqsg
4 miles per dollar. U earn 4 miles per $1 u spend,btohqsg
But your query is on signing up rewards. Most importantly if you have specific spending then as correctly pointed out  you need to get specific cards for the specific type of spending unless you are willing to go for cards with less rewards but points which doesn't expire.,btohqsg
Hello all  anyone knows any way to earn miles while paying for singtel bills? I thought of use CRMC in singtel app but then saw that it is AXSpayment. Paying like that won't earn miles correct?,btohqsg
If i link grab pay later with citi rewards cc will i still earn the bonus points?,btohqsg
No. Grab PayLater is same as Grab Top-up,btohqsg
Should I still use chocolate finance when overseas? Is it still capped at 1k spend?üò¨,btohqsg
still cap at 1k. Depends on what other options you have. Still a decent option but id prioritize my crmc + aamze,btohqsg
No fate already. Withdrawing now .,btohqsg
Thanks a lot! Yea I will use amaze crmc and if exceed will use chocolate.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs always a good reminder no matter what chocolate finance says before  its not a bank and you are not putting deposit there. Withdraw your money if you dont trust it.,btohqsg
Have end of next week to receive it ü§£,btohqsg
actually if they are serious about salvaging their reputation they should just dangle 5% interest guaranteed (and they will top it up if it falls short) and limit axs payments,btohqsg
This might actually look desperate and cause more people to lose confidence,btohqsg
this was a PR disaster and exposed the weakness of the company business model,btohqsg
üòÖ. That is 2% above 3% base rate.For 100 millions of deposit  that will increase the cost by 2 millions.,btohqsg

should work. i recall most in app payments at dining places will e under 5812 or 5814 or 5734.,btohqsg
Read the second part of my message,btohqsg
oops sorry realise i misread it haha. so choc card transactions are back up? also any idea why up to $250 only?,btohqsg
Because they will pay out of their pocket first and then liquidate the funds to offset the payment made. Having large payments will create an impact on their own pocket  similar to instant withdrawals.,btohqsg
Still unable to pay using Choc although less than $250 leh.,btohqsg

maybank family and friends? but requires min spend,btohqsg
Unfortunately  for higher rates (like arnd 6%) for SimplyGo  they all come with some form of minimum spend now  mostly $600 or $800. Best case I can think of is UOB ONE  but min $500 across the quarterIf not no min spend u will have to look at either 2% or below cashback or 1.something mpd,btohqsg
If use citibank rewards on hitpay  is it considered online transaction and can get 4mpd? The mcc is 5811,btohqsg

Hi all  I recall someone here shared about his fraudulent deductions from his Youtrip acc. Wonder if it got resolved and anyone with similar experience can share.My friend got hit by sgd$800+ deductions in Czech from her Youtrip balance overnight. The card was locked  and no otp alerts  nothing. Report to Youtrip but all they did was suspend the card and refuse to acknowledge the request for refund. Sigh any thoughts on what can be done next? Thanks!,btohqsg
