You must go fast to flip a SUV 270 degrees parallel,btohqsg
guys ltr idw do h3 bio and ended up doing h3 chem,btohqsg
@aforacejiejie will be the reason why,btohqsg
i wanna do h3 rizzology studies,btohqsg
Wah wah this one ah jump fr h1 go to h3 hp is a bit too much,btohqsg
forthe last time I don't take econs,btohqsg
aiya h1h2 content same same h3 also lah,btohqsg
If only my chem did btr in j1  i would hv taken h3 chem instead of math,btohqsg
"tbh how did econs become the ""default"" humanities",btohqsg
cuz never take during o lvl,btohqsg
because ppl keep assuming I take BCME for some reason,btohqsg
Idk but i know it before entering,btohqsg
because ppl got traumatised from history and geog,btohqsg
I mean it's expected la but still I a bit :p,btohqsg
im still thinking between history and econs,btohqsg
H3 bio + H3 chem + H3 math + H3 geog lets go,btohqsg
because i do enjoy history (im barely passing),btohqsg
Nah just kidding I don't take geog,btohqsg
+ h3 gp and pw and mt,btohqsg
or why I send the pic about Anwar in the morning,btohqsg
And i took econs coz tbh i dun like the rest,btohqsg
For a very long time I thought econs was cooking,btohqsg
but i also used to learn a lot about market,btohqsg
if you're not interested in SEA hist take h1 hist,btohqsg
so i figure econs would be better for me,btohqsg
h1 hist is just o level history buffed,btohqsg
I feel like if you don't have interest for hist  taking h2 can be super painful,btohqsg
i might just take h2 econs,btohqsg
Then again I'm the only person taking my combination in my cohort so,btohqsg
School econs is the economics we studyâ€¦dd ss  exchange rate  monetary policy  fiscal policy,btohqsg
if i even can get 4h2,btohqsg
My school had no home econs  they called it fce,btohqsg
but only if u get mc from siyan,btohqsg
I mean tbh not taking econs is like when you see ppl yapping econs stuff you don't understand what they saying,btohqsg
None of my close friends take h2 econs though,btohqsg
is either H1 or they take some Yee yee humanities like me,btohqsg
Yea bro end of year project was to cook curry chicken. My team ended up serving raw potatoes+ get this,btohqsg
Dump in hot water then took it out  peeled and cut it,btohqsg
Our curry chicken was canned  we cooked it but apparently we cooked nothing,btohqsg
Why u dump the whole thing????,btohqsg
I want to do h3 yapperology,btohqsg
Idk we thought boiling water softens the skin,btohqsg
Meanwhile randkmdkd can somehow absorb and understand Econs knowledge just like that,btohqsg
My friend almost made the worst decision in history of that curry chicken meal,btohqsg
He said it would stand out  he wanted to put ice around it,btohqsg
I bet if he were to sit for an Econs a level paper now without having sat in a single Econs class he can get at least a B,btohqsg
The only edible shit on that plate was the sauce,btohqsg
But tbh no manâ€¦econs like need write long essays,btohqsg
I was like Aight no econs,btohqsg
I mean wanted to stand out ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
