üéâPika World Insights ‚Äì July 7 2022üéâüõéThe Fed‚Äôs MinutesüóùThe FOMC minutes continued to hammer a hawkish statement as the anxiety over inflation  and a more restrictive policy took place. Members of the FOMC minutes signalled another 0.75% rate hike in July. The hot consumer price index has to cool down before a fall in consumer inflation expectations.Now  the subsequent uncertainty is  what‚Äôs after July?üí∞Stocks cheer on FOMC  an irony?üóΩDespite the tough stance on inflation in the FOMC minutes  investors felt that the economic landscape had shifted since the June FOMC meeting.
