Hihi? Anybody got experience applying for bto as a cabin crew and how does hdb assess the loan amount?,btohqsg
It will still by CPF amount  contribution and 12 Months payslip. Apply for your HFE then you will know how much maximum loan they gave.,btohqsg
But if by cpf amount then as a cabin crew if my income ceiling exceeds the cap then how will that work also,btohqsg
Not sure about this  but you might drop a feedback form to HDB to have them to answer you.,btohqsg
You can also do a preliminary check under the HFE letter. That'll be a good gauge.,btohqsg
Got my DIA approved ü•π thank you!,btohqsg
Hi everyone  full disclosure  I am an Interior Designer  feel free to ask me any questions regarding your renovation.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs great!! So happy for you!,btohqsg
Hi when  canberra  drive  BTO completely?,btohqsg
They will likely ask for it 2-3 months before key collection.,btohqsg
No ah grant was given before your 2nd appointment.As for the loan  I‚Äôm not too sure. If it‚Äôs a couple  the loan amount will reduce accordingly unless the other partner likely earns the same amount as the couple in the past.,btohqsg
You need to write into HDB to ask them what is their process if this does happen.,btohqsg
Oh I see‚Ä¶ then pls write into HDB to check pls!,btohqsg
Nope. HFE is the confirmed grant + loan amount. Grant will be disbursed before 2nd appointment  and then during 2nd appt  the grant be used to offset your downpayment,btohqsg
hi  just to check. Once my HFE is approved  i dont have to provide any documents right?,btohqsg
Just curious  why some BTO new projects have balconies? Are we able to know whether a new project will have balcony or not before applying for the BTO? Do they release the designs before sales launch?Planning to apply for the October BTO launch,btohqsg
Yes you can see the floor plan of the BTO before applying,btohqsg
When sales launch u go inside check the floorplan. And of course all this with balcony ones very popular  projects that have also not all units will have   so your Q number also must be way above the nos of the unit with balcony then u can have a chance.,btohqsg
