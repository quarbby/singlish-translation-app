Hey guys just want to clarify for HSBC Revo  non white list also get 1x reward points?,btohqsg
Non whitelist and non excluded then 1x,btohqsg
okay  so only whitelist is eligible for 10x for the $1000 spend. Non whitelist still get 1x points and does not affect the $1000 spend for 10x points?so to give an example if I spent $40 on transport (simplygo) I get 40 points. Then I spent $1000 on online retail and get 10000 points. Am I right? or would the $40 that I spent affect the $1000  and they only consider $960 for 10x points?,btohqsg
Makes sense. Just checking is there any disadvantage to this or anything to take note if I do this? Thanks,btohqsg

Got bad review on fb or Reddit I think say can't refund,btohqsg

Yes. I also opened an EGA account with HSBC and registered for the bonus interest promo. But whenever I ask customer care what interest I am getting on my deposit. They always say 0.05%,btohqsg
yup the hsbc customer service officer doesnt seem very knowledgeable on the promos when i called too. base interest is 0.05%  the bonus interest of 4.55% will only be paid out 6 months later,btohqsg
so there's a kind of component of a 6 months fixed deposit / tbill concept inside,btohqsg
