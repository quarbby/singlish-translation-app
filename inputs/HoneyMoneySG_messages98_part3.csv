Lol u say rising phoenix. Sounds so confirmed that i went to google it. üòÇ,btohqsg
If you're going for UOB One bonus interest  then you need the MAB. If you're anticipating for the next promo  you need the EDB to be as close to $0.,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks but no where we can see what was our EDB right? As long us we keep minimal or empty before 6.30pm on 30th Mar should be fine?,btohqsg
But i was paired with my savings acct which is considered debit card rite ?,btohqsg
As long you transfer out to another bank by 1030pm then it's okay.,btohqsg
Ichange topup to tng suspended liao,btohqsg
U will know on 1st april.IF the new april promo get launched  u will pull out your march statement  and at the last line  u will see the EDB. Then do accordingly to the TNC of the new promoNo point thinking about it now. There is nothing u can do now also to adjust your EDB anymore. Enjoy your weekend.,btohqsg
This is debit card settings  rite ?,btohqsg
Did you check if you set to credit card or debit card before you top-up?,btohqsg
How to set to debit card settings pls ?,btohqsg
I am in savings acct but apparently should be considered debit oredi rite ?,btohqsg
If you're already paired to savings account and it still charges you 1%  maybe you should check with their CSO why it's still being charged as credit card ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt credit/debit is determined based on card number? I thought linking to savings works as ATM card  not debit.,btohqsg
Did you check the transfer date?,btohqsg
It is only about source (credit or saving). TnG will recognise the card as a credit card based on card numbers,btohqsg
Maybe ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è if they used the BIN to check.,btohqsg
So meaning cannot use trust card to top up or auto payment  ? Unless pay the 1%,btohqsg
Can try YouTrip to top-up but got mixed dp where some say can  some say cannot. Even YouTrip themselves recommend linking YouTrip card to TNG eWallet.Alternatively is buy tng reload pin on another platform but it adds risk of getting scammed by the 3rd party.,btohqsg
what's the reason for transferring out please,btohqsg
To maintain MAB for the most optimal 3% interest. But too bad today's Sunday  the base interest will be counted towards next months MAB.,btohqsg
If my friend only transfer out her 100k today is it too late?,btohqsg
Gg already. If tnc of new promo is same as old. Cannot participate efficiently,btohqsg
Ask your friend transfer back in and try again in Jun lolSame thing  Jun also end on Sunday ü§™,btohqsg
Jun can watch another round of JIT warriors ü§£,btohqsg
We can only try to remind and prompt Loh.,btohqsg
"There is a promo that we have speculated will happen that will reference 31st march end day balance number. If its zero  then any extra amount put in after 1st april will be considered as ""fresh fund"".Can goggle uob read up on ""rising dragon"" promoReason for transferring immediately out on the day it is deposited in  will mean the day end balance remain the same as before.Mainly this is done for those who has MAB at 100k in their account. Because any extra above 100k will have pathetic returns",btohqsg
They're talking about maintaining MAB for UOB Stash account  by withdrawing the base interest.,btohqsg
My friend ask me isn‚Äôt it End of day balance? Why if transfer out now can‚Äôt get participate efficiently,btohqsg
Because UOB transfers after a normal Saturday 10:30pm considered next business day.,btohqsg
Hi  for Citi PremierMiles Card;1. Do you earn miles for hotel and flight bookings2. Can you tag with Instarem Amaze card for evad FX charge and earn miles spending overseas?,btohqsg
Dependent on the bank. I always assume Saturday 11am to be safe. (I‚Äôm Kiasi type).,btohqsg
Hahaha to discourage JIT warriors also,btohqsg
Just put 101 000 in la to cover the bonus interest as well,btohqsg
After 100k got no bonus interest lol,btohqsg
This mth bonus interest not in yet ma,btohqsg
So play safe just put 101 000 in to cover,btohqsg
This month's bonus interest is based on this month's MAB. Nothing to do with depositing 101k in Apr?,btohqsg
They just credited 3.98 for base interest in ma. So to get earmarked sucessfully u need to put in 100 03.98 ma‚Ä¶ but just in case this mth bonus interest also in on 1 apr which normally will only in on 2apr. So to play safe just throw 101 000 in can cover all,btohqsg
Don't get it... The math don't add up sorry üòÖ not sure why you making things complicated..1 Apr just make sure got 100k + base interest (top-up to $10 also ok) then don't touch can already. At most withdraw the bonus interest on the day it's deposited.100k gets you full 5% EIR  if have promo then can register for earmark  don't have promo withdraw anything above 100k. Don't have to think what just in case lol.,btohqsg
I usually do $100 500 until earmark happens but that‚Äôs just kiasi me. For most people $100 100 and totally untouched until earmark happens should be fine.Just don‚Äôt 100 000.00,btohqsg
Hi.. anyone know the mcc code for express cafe and bar @ holiday inn express & suites Singapore novena? Heading to their Teochew buffet later,btohqsg
Hi all. Would to confirm if using CRMC via Paywave (Apple/Google) is considered online and eligible for 10x points.,btohqsg
No. Paywave is contactless  not online.,btohqsg
Whoa thanks for the fast reply. Looks like must use Amaze.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the whole point of Amaze.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a little troublesome cos can‚Äôt add Amaze to Apple Pay. Using iPhone.,btohqsg
I thought this reminder makes sense. Should withdraw whatever deposits that is made to the stash account on the day itself before end of the day. Otherwise  the MAB keep piling up over 100k and the excess earns pathetic return.(for this month  u have up to 1st april to do it  because sunday is non working day),btohqsg
Question. Amaze card is going to charge 1% on local transactions from 1 April.1. Is it still worth it to link it to other credit cards?2. Any other better options?,btohqsg
1% only when u spend above $1k1. Yes it is still worth as it converts your spending to online for bonus miles,btohqsg
Thanks. Sad; it used to be free. I linked it to UOB Krisflyer card.,btohqsg
