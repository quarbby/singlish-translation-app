could F1 be headed back to Sepang? 👀,btohqsg
Lowkey might be cheaper to go thr frm sg rather thn sg tickets,btohqsg
Do u have any clue about the price range?,btohqsg
Naw  i jst knw sg one is hella expensive compared to others,btohqsg
True actually.. everything in sg increasing price nowadays,btohqsg
Ye  plus it's a street circuit  so it gotta be more ex fr the closure,btohqsg
Whereas sepang alr a track with facilities fr people  rather thn build a month bef,btohqsg
Ik ah but the ticket prices itself in sg are... questionable,btohqsg
The only place tht ik will cost significantly more thn sg for f1 tickets is gonna be LA,btohqsg
But to be fair tho  gentings quite abit further,btohqsg
karting places  good food nearby  KLIA has decent shops and a Premium Outlet just beside too,btohqsg
If my wallet phat enuf it'll be fun,btohqsg
but wont be as fun imo,btohqsg
Plus sg u need squeeze in mrt until cmi also,btohqsg
min budget u have to set aside is 800 i find,btohqsg
Mroe fun if u no need to worry abt finances,btohqsg
Actually quite ok ah  the tickets u talking abt is walk around?,btohqsg
havent been to sepang gp leh,btohqsg
Okok ahhh  nt too ex or cheap  abt thr ah,btohqsg

Balloon scheme  30% dp and pay monthly for 7 years with 4.88% intrest,btohqsg

Yea hopefully we don't get caught,btohqsg
Jst drive the f1 car in,btohqsg
It’s the one u buy to get allocation for amg one isit,btohqsg
isnt tht if u buy Amg one den u can paint it or sumt,btohqsg
I think it’s the other way round haha,btohqsg
Dam man bought an amg one HAHA,btohqsg
Nah it was on the new what,btohqsg
They took tgt with the pagani?,btohqsg
It was like posted at cycle and carriage,btohqsg
Den like it was next to a pagani or smth,btohqsg
There was a post abt it I forgot ig or smth,btohqsg
Also there’s no registered GTR nismo in Singapore right,btohqsg
So is this an actually nismo or a kit?,btohqsg
theres a bunch of gtr’s with the nismo kit so,btohqsg
But it’s an official kit? Just not like factory nismo?,btohqsg
that’s not a amg one though,btohqsg
Yea but it’s the only black series in Singapore haha,btohqsg
Maybe he bought den they send back to paint,btohqsg
Idk how the livery thing works,btohqsg
other 2 is steven’s one and the orange unit,btohqsg
is like only when u get a amg one then u can get a amg gt black series in that livery i think,btohqsg
Yea so he bought a black series den he bought an amg one den they put the livery,btohqsg
I always thought the orange one was a gts with a black series kit,btohqsg
Unless u jus talking abt bs,btohqsg
u rmb the one at mbs,btohqsg
My biggest flex. Knowing one of the owner 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
omg so he has a amg one as well?,btohqsg
no one said it was an amg one lololololol,btohqsg
ok mb that i misunderstood but he said this here which led me to think that he was talking about a amg one,btohqsg

Polestar 2 will be the dual-motor all-wheel drive variant  capable of reaching 100kmh in 4.5 seconds and a top speed of 205kmh. It has an 82kWh battery  which gives it a range of around 470km on Singapore roads – provided it is not involved in repeated high-speed chases.,btohqsg
i think the only cars outrunning these,btohqsg
are polestar 2s themselves  and supercars,btohqsg
can easily catch cs3 and vios,btohqsg
even the old WRXs can catch,btohqsg
not a high bar to catch a vios,btohqsg
