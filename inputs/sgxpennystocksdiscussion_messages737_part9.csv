Is reduction of share capital good?Capital reduction can be used as a tool to achieve various company objectives: Paying dividends: The most common objective is the payment of dividends. Capital reduction allows the elimination of accumulated losses  which would otherwise prevent the payment of dividends  to create distributable reserves.,btohqsg
Capital reduction is the process of decreasing a company's shareholder equity through share cancellations and share repurchases  also known as share buybacks. The reduction of capital is done by companies for numerous reasons  includingincreasing shareholder value and producing a more efficient capital structure.,btohqsg

What I meant is that this capital reduction is to eliminate accumulated losses  just an accounting entry whereby u see share capital reduce to cover the losses. This is not capital reduction by share cancellations through special payouts or cancellations of the buyback shares.,btohqsg
Can you tell me TOH on what basis? Just anyhow shout TOH is it?😂,btohqsg
Of course lah  we can read the annoucement. There is no payout. I just posted the a few objectives of capital reduction. Bottom line is it's good thing.,btohqsg
Won't affect float. No. of shares remain the same. Just reduce the par value of the shares.,btohqsg

Just realised GEO energy ($0.360) gave an investor update a day before.Subtle Heads up given by management- EXEMPLARY RESULTS- RECORD REVENUE- HIGHEST NET PROFIT IN 2022- HOWEVER  MARKET NOT PRICING SHARES AT RIGHT VALUESource:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/45KLRCHTAK80OGPE/739448_3Q2022%20Analysts%20and%20Investors%20Briefing_22%20Nov%202022.pdf,btohqsg
Even the management  boldly declares in the investor report- Geo energy shares being undervalued- Shares trading less than 1x EBITDA- US$215 million cash hoardIndustry outlook seems to benefit GEO too.After reading this  it shows management has now realised how undervalued their counter is.Since they have done the share buy backs recently   I believe they might be undertaking share buy backs very soon too.If I remember right  now that they are going into dividends start Dec22  there might be a lock-in period where they cannot do SBB (not 100% sure on this  do correct if wrong )It makes sense for price to maintain at $0.355 to $0.365 prior to Dividends record date and after that  expect some SBB action to come into play since they heads up that next quarter and full year will be a record high.Also  I won’t be surprised that a big special dividends to be announced. Seems like management in-line based on this report.Let’s go,btohqsg
Hong Lai Huat weekly and zoomed in view.$0.065 to $0.066 is the best price to collect this one as you can see it cannot break this level over 2 months period.Also  volume at the base here shows it is consolidating before the break up reversal which looks very close as there is no space to push price down.PS: TP along the way depends on whether you are fifo  swing trade  mid to long term trade.OSOD,btohqsg
Special dividends / proposed capital reduction makes sense . Pray hard. If they go with this   big huat for Geo holders.,btohqsg
US Stocks Pare Gains as Traders Await Policy Clues:Markets Wrap(Bloomberg) -- US stocks fluctuated as investors await the release of policy minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting for potential signs that the central bank may slow its pace of interest-rate hikes.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 trimmed earlier gains. Market trading volumes are expected to be lighter  given the US Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.Treasuries pared the gains it notched after weaker-than-expected purchasing managers’ index readings for November.* A gauge of dollar strength dipped after data showed that US unemployment applications rose more than expected  in a sign of cooling in the labor market.* Oil fell as the European Union discussed imposing a price cap on Russian oil between $65 and $70 a barrel.The publication of minutes from the Fed’s Nov. 1-2 meeting -- due at 2 p.m. in Washington -- will be studied for how united policy makers were over a higher peak for interest rates than previously signaled in their fight against inflation.* However  since that meeting  investors have parsed a bevy of economic data that somewhat eased inflation concerns. That  along with recent rhetoric from Fed speakers  has made some investors anticipate the central bank will moderate its pace of rate hikes soon.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-poised-wall-street-225623233.html,btohqsg
