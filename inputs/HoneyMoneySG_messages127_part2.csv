Thanks. I try to use Scoot apps to book next flight  but can‚Äôt seem to find an option for me to utilise the 1000 miles. Any idea how to use it?,btohqsg
For me  the bonus 1000 KF miles came in when my scoot flight miles got posted,btohqsg
No need to do anything extra when booking. As long as the miles for scoot flight get posted before the deadline  they will auto credit the bonus miles to you,btohqsg
I din get the 1000 miles when my scoot flight get posted. ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
Not sure I understood your question. For World Woman  online bonus points applicable for the first S$1500. For Woman  it's the first S$1000.,btohqsg

You earn from cc spend not miles flown.,btohqsg
What about the kris flyer account link,btohqsg
Whoever takes the flight will get kf miles,btohqsg

It‚Äôs very strange that my monthly spending is $2k to $4k online spend  yet I only receive 1000+ points every month! Called up customer service and the person also has no idea why,btohqsg
Maybe use the DBS digibot and check points per transaction to see if any excluded spend?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve done that.. it‚Äôs shows that for every $5 spent  I earn 1 point?,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that states recurring payments (eg. telco) are excluded from citi rewards 10x? Saw some comments here and there but couldn't find it in their TNCUnless it falls under the(iii) bill paymentsexclusion,btohqsg
Correct  you get 1 point for every $5 eligible spend when the transaction post. Then 9x point for the entire calendar month given in lump sum on the 16 of next calendar month,btohqsg
Will the 9x point be reflected in the monthly statement?,btohqsg
For example  I spent $2500 in the past month. Subject to $1500 cap  I would have earned $1500/5x10= 3000points right?,btohqsg
Think you'll still get base points for the excess amount.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôve only received 1000+ points. The previous month I spent $4k  mostly online transactions too. So  I‚Äôm sure I spent beyond the $1.5k cap and should have gotten at least 3000 points.,btohqsg
When checking digibot was there any transaction exceeding $5 dollars earn 0 point?,btohqsg
In that month  I also received only 1000+ points,btohqsg
Of course most transactions will be subjected to rounding,btohqsg
What did you spend on?Is it online transaction?Which date you spend?,btohqsg
Mostly on Fairprice app  ShopBack  grab  Amazon,btohqsg
If the transaction exceeds $5 dollars and you get 0 point means ineligible transaction. No base given then no bonus point in the next month as well for this transaction.,btohqsg
As mentioned  I get 1 point for every $5 that‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
Any transaction under Favepay?Points credited in two batches. Base points credited within few days after transactions and bonus on 16th day next month.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm reading my monthly statement under edocuments. The points are on monthly basis.,btohqsg
Where are u reading your points from?,btohqsg
Ive been in Singapore for 12 months and had a credit card for 6 months payments have been made on time etc,btohqsg

there is no concept of Credit Rating in Singapore for humansonly for companies who want to pay rating agencies for credit ratingif you are referring to Credit Bureau Credit Score  you can start one by applying for a credit facility/card.,btohqsg
