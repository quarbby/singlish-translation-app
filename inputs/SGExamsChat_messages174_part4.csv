Bruh if u use a French curve itâ€™s exact,btohqsg
Probably but it depends on what u write,btohqsg
But there were 2 angles ?,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll probably get like 1-2 m,btohqsg
think if u identify sas is 1 mark,btohqsg
Haizz Bruh i fucking blur go put retarded reason haizz,btohqsg
The number of movies students watch are more consistent rite,btohqsg
the spread is wider for adults,btohqsg
At least it's just 1 mark,btohqsg
wot how did u get aaa,btohqsg
Idk my brain go monkey mode,btohqsg
Can find it earlier in the chat,btohqsg
wait is 95+ considered not good,btohqsg
A lot of people gonna get 200%,btohqsg
I minus like about 5 marks across the 2 papers,btohqsg
For a1â€™s itâ€™s gonna be like who gets more callus mistakes,btohqsg
Cos 1 mark holds different weight age across d two years,btohqsg
paper is indeed easier compared to past few years eh,btohqsg
Is 95% enough for A1 idk,btohqsg
95% almost certainly can get A1 one la,btohqsg
they can't increase it by so much,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s probably where the moderation is,btohqsg
I lost about like 13 marks across both papers so I might drop to A2 hais,btohqsg
is 30+% enough for a pass idk,btohqsg
Anyone can show like how much,btohqsg
If emaths is easy  do u think a maths is gonna be difficult,btohqsg
u canâ€™t be sarcastic through text..:,btohqsg
The paper 2 answer key has sued,btohqsg
The last question answer isnâ€™t supposed to be in pounds,btohqsg
I lost like 15 marks across both papers though,btohqsg
Might have to settle without an A1,btohqsg
can i say tangent perpendicular to radius??,btohqsg
They did dat cos no matter what conversion rate d base amount stays relatively same,btohqsg
cause its about length not angle,btohqsg
Nvm at least youâ€™ll confirm get at least A2,btohqsg
1 is vert opp  other 2 is tangent from ext point,btohqsg
I just wrote tangents of the same circle,btohqsg
But need to say sas tho,btohqsg
Could be a B3 if my nightmares are true,btohqsg
if u identify sas u'll get a mark i think,btohqsg
if you actually lost only 15 A2 is most likely,btohqsg
btw A2 pool is very big,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think can but probably at most lose 1 for wrong reason,btohqsg
If u lose the bulk of ur marks in paper 2 I think u can get A2 or even A1,btohqsg
I probably lost most in paper 1,btohqsg
My paper 2 is contrary to most.. better than my paper 1,btohqsg
Like my prelims I barely passed my paper 1 but got A for paper 2,btohqsg
I think I got around 91% only so I really hope I wonâ€™t fall into the A2 pool,btohqsg
thanks ðŸ˜­ why this paper so hard,btohqsg
just pray dat u don't get some nasty ass old professor as ur marker,btohqsg
