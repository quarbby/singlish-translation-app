hso let it go back down to 0.001/2 then load up to average out the buy at 0.007 üòÇ,btohqsg
Why not you sell now and buy back later at 0.002,btohqsg

Contra has never been a good idea  highly risky. Sorry to say. Be safe pls. Buy what you can pick up if is good stock. üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt follow top spotter. By the time u get in  alr 1/2 pip higher   then they sell u. Once in a while will hv some that move la  but if I see the trend  it‚Äôs only maybe 1 in 10 call will continue moving. Best is you do your own research,btohqsg
HS Optimus (HSO) Added more 0.006.The previous gap up 0.006 to 0.008 can only be done by the BBs. Price drop to this level was expected due to the gap up. But not much real selling to get into back to the price before the gap up. highly likely the BBs doing a good flushing before they push up any further. Easily can go back to 0.008 level as shown previously.Buy this one need to hold. This price is reasonable as HSO is likely one of the more undervalued counters around.NAV : $0.012xCash : $17mHonestly  I do not see real distribution done at all and the sellers at 0.006 are likely retailers trying to cut. Not BBs distributing. If they wanted to distribute they would not have stack 90 000 lots at 0.009 and instead put 5000 lots there continuously to sell off to retailers.$0.006 is a buy in my opinion. Good luck to us holders,btohqsg
yesterday us counter also make me sad... pre market up 60% i hold out to see if it will go up more  by end of day  lower than entry price,btohqsg
Now this price is  very safe n if lost  will be due to bad timing,btohqsg
Sell now  buy back at 0.002 you will have 3x lot.,btohqsg
i q 7 to selll see if can done,btohqsg
Follow my own study and own call,btohqsg
One day shout 10 counters  one counter up and all say the spotter very zhun,btohqsg
Lucky my loss not alot for contra,btohqsg
They shout 10 only 2 will up. The rest will be gone case,btohqsg
And those that i follow gone case,btohqsg
Want sell also no one buy,btohqsg
thats how my warehouse got 30 counters now la... but it is my own decision to follow and also i set my own sl,btohqsg
The rest is they sell to you for 1 pip profits. Leave u holding the bag,btohqsg
