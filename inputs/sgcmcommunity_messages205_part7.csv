Might as well buy straight without pumping V Power,btohqsg
Limited edition huh. Buy from where? I won’t empower scalpers. I hate scalpers,btohqsg
95 - 2.8898 - 3.40$0.52 diff0.52 x 150l = $78$78 + $59.90 = $137.90,btohqsg
Iirc  tht thing cost $150+ without e promo,btohqsg
Sorry hor v power is not 98. It’s 3.64 per litre,btohqsg
But v power day u can buy v power at 98 price,btohqsg
U know the shell attendant well enough?,btohqsg
Anyways it’s over ler. I only sharing because I drove a month with v power and I feel the difference so just comment since u guys talking abt fuel.,btohqsg
I agree don’t need to spend on expensive fuel. Even sports cars stick to 98 mostly don’t go v power.,btohqsg
Ok lah if can afford V power go ahead. If not pay for which u can afford 🤣,btohqsg
more like don't make blanket statements without making a fair comparison or just assumptions,btohqsg
Hi. I pump 92 can ?,btohqsg

How do container ships pass through it? Underwater?,btohqsg
Looking for a 16/17 car. Is mazda 3 okie. Any major problems?,btohqsg
Just don't kena capacitor issue and PHV unit,btohqsg
Stop at malacca then bypass sg through Indo water,btohqsg
That difficult to spot. I kanna a phv vezel with tamper mileage before. Repair until i headache.,btohqsg
Thus better to eliminate the risk... just siam common PHV models,btohqsg
Is the HB version safer? Cus have seen a mazda hb phv,btohqsg
Just get ready to change capacitor. Don't think u can escape that,btohqsg
Can advise which model to consider as the safe side?,btohqsg
Each brand and model has its own strength and weekness. Rule of thumb  buy with your heart  not your mind. I'm driving a b&bJapanese coz it's perceived as reliable and cheaper to run. But my previous conti makes me smile more though I had to spend more on maintenance,btohqsg
HB a little more rare compared to sedan so got more chance won’t be a PHV vehicle but I wouldn’t rule it out completely. Maybe the rarer 2.0l HB would be less of a PHV,btohqsg
Whether it’s PHV or private car  capacitor issues for Mazda tend to show up when you hit above 70k so higher mileage may run into the same issues.If you have a slightly higher budget  you can consider looking at Mazda 6  more roomy  way lesser chance to be a PHV and I can’t remember which model it is but some do not have capacitors,btohqsg
Any other recommend model for a 2016/17 car?,btohqsg
My fam also looking at 16/17 model. Test drove quite a few such as fit jazz vezel harrier 3008 a3,btohqsg
Jap car such as honda toyota always got the perceived notion of reliable but that is also a reason they r commonly used as PHV,btohqsg
Mazda capacitor how much only lol $50?,btohqsg
Altis/Vios Sienta/Freed Maz3/5 Vezel/HRV Fit/Jazz all common PHV models,btohqsg
Knowing your source  probably $50 for you.,btohqsg
Its all bread n butter car. Nth exciting. Sound proofing and drive is nothing to wow about compared to conti/high range jap car such as harrier,btohqsg
I rarely c ppl use Mazda do phv now. Quite Useless car,btohqsg
Getting a 1/2 yrs jap car and a conti.. ur risk would be pretty much similar. Jap being PHV prone vs Conti repair prone. I would reckon u choosing either a harrier or a conti to be on the safe side. Harrier depre higher but comfy. Conti depre lower but the depre safe can be used for repair,btohqsg
How fast u wan to rush from 1 traffic light to another?,btohqsg
If his budget higher can go 3008,btohqsg
Even better. The comfort level is definitely much better than maz or vezel or the basic cars,btohqsg
Lol u go nshw wanna rush from 1 jam to another jam?,btohqsg
$10 off if you quote Kingsmen10,btohqsg
Msia leh. Not autobahn. Comfort > Performance in NSHW,btohqsg
