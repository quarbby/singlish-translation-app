If take high floor is it true our hle doesn‚Äôt cover the higher level we take ?,btohqsg
depends on the amount of loan disburse to you based on your combined income,btohqsg
Ex : I‚Äôm taking last floor unit .... the cost of the house is 247k they will offset from my loan rite ?,btohqsg
example if the house is $600k  your HLE of $400k and deposit 10% $60k plus misc fee at $15k max  you'll need $125k of shortfall to eligible for the key collections  otherwise you have to cough up the money by hook or crooknot forgetting expenses on reno/appliances/furniture  say $50kand if you're not married  another $50k for wedding expenses,btohqsg
Cause someone told me that if I‚Äôm taking higher level my loan doesn‚Äôt cover my level,btohqsg
don't know have i answered your question  but I shall save that as a template lol,btohqsg
So if my HLE is not enough to cover the remaining 90% of the price of my house  I will need to pay the outstanding upfront? During signing of lease or collection of keys?,btohqsg
of course you must make sure both of your OA are enough for the 10% deposit during 2nd appointment aka signing of LOa,btohqsg
unless any of you is below 30  only 5%,btohqsg
.oh no wonder something is missing,btohqsg
you'll need to put back the money into your OA upon selling the house  plus accrued interest,btohqsg
the grant can be offset the 5%/10% deposit,btohqsg
Hi everyone  got a question. We‚Äôre able to collect our keys upon 90% completion right?,btohqsg
is it always best to get max years of loan from HDB?,btohqsg
Q:Will the keys be issued only when the entire precinct is completed?A:Keys to each block will be handed over once works on the block are completed. Keys will be issued on a block by block basis.,btohqsg
Q:Will we be collecting keys in the month of the Probable Completion Date?A:Key collection will be scheduled progressively for the flat buyers about two weeks after the actual completion of the block of flats. Hence  if the block is handed over to the HDB in the early part of the month  you will likely collect the keys in that month. Otherwise  key collection will begin in the following month.,btohqsg
CPF 2.5% interest  if you can get better interest rate through CPF investment  getting max loan period is better,btohqsg
but the accrued interest is compounding at the same time  it won't stop even if you have cleared your loan till you put it back,btohqsg
someone correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
because bank loan is not as stable and compassionate as HDB,btohqsg
we are paying the difference in interest rate for stability and unseen uncertainty,btohqsg
I mean if you can tank many years of bank loan given the crisis  why not?,btohqsg
Becus if u late payment one month.. Bank will not hesitate to make u homeless,btohqsg
I heard bank loan low interest,btohqsg
Play safe u can go for hdb,btohqsg
yes definitely  but HDB loan for stability,btohqsg
I believe majority of us do,btohqsg
sian my TOP date pushed back another 2 quarters,btohqsg
