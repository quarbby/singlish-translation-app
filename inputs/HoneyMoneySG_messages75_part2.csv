quick Q abt IBKR - is it better to convert US$ in my own bank first then TT to IBKR - or just transfer SGD first and do the conversion on IBKR directly? so far iâ€™ve only deposited via TT once and thereâ€™s about US$40+ fees. however when i checked the IBKR conversion fee  it seems much less attractive (0.715) vs. the bank (0.738). any advice appreciated to reduce costs in the long run. tyvm!,btohqsg
