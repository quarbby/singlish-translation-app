now its with his best buddy nikos,btohqsg
because they dont have to worry about battery,btohqsg
jeff is driving LRDM leased from wearnes also HAHA,btohqsg
I remember he got the s60 and then thebxc60,btohqsg
doesnt make sense for them to buy,btohqsg
dont have to worry about resale  mileage etc etc,btohqsg
And wearnes can pay him research fees,btohqsg
battery state of health also dont have to care haha,btohqsg
yalor  his car hvnt even take out the Polestar 2 sticker,btohqsg
Hahaha no la   but the amount of effort he put in  shld be rewarded,btohqsg
There was an s60 t8 on sale earlier this year,btohqsg
he kindly let me sit in his PS2 a few weeks ago,btohqsg
Hahaha a real mustang. But tbh the mach e is actually a very good deal,btohqsg
i be very frank with you,btohqsg
anything wrong with T8  u cannot siam wearnes,btohqsg
I know the dealer that's why keep an eye on the stock,btohqsg
cos only they have the manual and parts and resources,btohqsg
Yes i saw that unit. Higher than the purchase price,btohqsg
this are all heavily guarded by Volvo Cars,btohqsg
And also not in the color i wanted,btohqsg
they dont want to release to consumers for free  only sell it to them for a high price,btohqsg
I mean its quite a feat form engineering perspective,btohqsg
at least 20-30k more expensive compared to when my friend bought newðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But you know the hp and torque is inaccurate right,btohqsg
Ya as well as the timing,btohqsg
Think of Volvo EV as a cheap polestar then,btohqsg
But just a tad slower than a m340i,btohqsg
Volvo claims it is la  they showed with dyno and everyth. But you cannot just add ICE and EV engine tgt to get max output,btohqsg
I always prefer the sleeper  unicorn types,btohqsg
u will not see volvo and polestar cross into each other teritory,btohqsg
That was my concern  i think spoke about it when i first joined this chat,btohqsg
yeah they managed to get the hp and torque to be accurate la,btohqsg
Meanwhile Mercedes engineers working for so many years on the project one realizing they can't get the numbers they first claimed,btohqsg
need count first feet of roll out,btohqsg
and the thing about T8 is that there might be surges of energy,btohqsg
hence the 402 hp claimed might be understated or overstated at times,btohqsg
i will not go into the specifics and graphs and physics because its 1:30 in the morning,btohqsg
but if u want i can do an explanation next time LOL,btohqsg
Did my message just get deleted,btohqsg
But.t feel is all that matters,btohqsg
but t feel will decline over time,btohqsg
Blue S60 T8 owner said that he is feeling the batt might have lost abit of life,btohqsg
I thought u meant the novelty,btohqsg
Head banging never gets old for me,btohqsg
i like to think that the T8 is a mini f1 car,btohqsg
But i will assume so la. Battery tech is not so advanced yet,btohqsg
we have ERS/MGU-K/MGU-H which provides additional power to the already strong small displacement energy,btohqsg
Only the 918 spyder cam claim that title,btohqsg
okay but scale this down 2xðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
haha i am excited for the MY2023 T8s,btohqsg
