Ejc is so understaffed they need their ALUMNI to support the event,btohqsg
I'll just hang out abit and gtfo if I'm intimidated enough  by the ppl there,btohqsg
Reason why we are top 4/5 in a level performance is because we have decent students,btohqsg

What is ej cop these days ah,btohqsg
I rmbr my batch it was 8,btohqsg
But its also cuz they upped the intake,btohqsg
They accepting more students into EJC every year,btohqsg
Which is why the COP doesn't rly fluctuate,btohqsg
Probably to account for the JCs shifting and stuff,btohqsg
So from a logistical standpoint it doesn't make sense to burden them with more srudents,btohqsg
Which is why one cher takes abt 3/4 classes,btohqsg
My batch had abt 4-5 students come back to teach,btohqsg
And geog is normally merged classes,btohqsg
Cuz they dh enough geog students,btohqsg
6/20 students get more than 40 for paper 1,btohqsg

the current location abit hard to go for those staying far,btohqsg

Physics: The department in general ranges from pretty good to absolute dogshit. The notes are not bad tho but the papers are very killer :( Be prepared to fail every single paper until promos. For Mid years the pass was 40% and the distinction rate was 3%. For Promos the pass was 60% and the distinction rate was 8%. Some of the topics tested were also not in syllabus so yeah.Chemistry: Literally the most stacked science like actually damn good. The papers are very similar to a level standards but it is much more difficult for organic chem as compared to physical chem. Teachers are very willing to contribute and overqualified imo. (Literally go look at EJ website :D)Biology: Generally pretty good. Notes are very comprehensive but exam papers are damn anal and kinda weird. (10m qn on how microscopes contribute to studying of biology).Econs: Dont take it. If u want to take econs dont come EJ. But in general the econs department ranges from good (a select few) to like disappearing because they dont turn up for lessons. Notes are horrible. Lectures are disappointing and do not fully cover the notes + does not fully cover the syllabus. Pray for a good teacher and you should do well for econs. Practice!History: You will never be bored in history. They are super fking entertaining. It is one of the few subjects that have alot of live lectures. Their comments are damn good for practices (Legit gives feedback for both bad and good). Alot of discipline is needed to do readings by yourself tho as there isnt really content lectures/tutorials. Generally everything is done by the students. Sample essays are also posted onto google classroom  done by your batchmates.Geography: Geog notes are damn entertaining. Also live lectures damn fun. For our batch however we literally only have 2 teachers but the 2 teachers are damn stacked. Plus the like amount of practices they give is damn alot and the teachers for extra practises they do stuff like marking extra work a few hours before the exam and still going through for us. Like honestly they are damn good and they have a collected book of every model essay from 2017 to now.Lit: i dont take lit. but i heard that the lit chers for your batch is damn good!GP: lectures make me want to kill myself. Ranges from good teachers to dogshit. Hard to get an A. They dont give enough practises so u legit need go do urself. Content not provided UNTIL ur in J2. A shit ton of packages tho (Although the naming damn confusing). Packages include model essays  abit of content (Student compiled). Singapore context stuff. Alot of extra practice qns but not used in class or gone through.PW: We dont know because yall get new teachers since almost every pw cher in ej is leaving the school :(  although some of the good teachers are staying behind.Culture: Cancel. Tiktok. Basketball. Ulti. House.Council: basically useless they do nothing they suck their own dicks. Alot of their initiatives proposed by council is for themselves only  if they even get anything done. They havent came up with anything unique YET (Please come up with something.) Getting in is legit a popularity contest  regardless of JAE or JIP  as long as u can make friends in a quick span of time can get in.Segregation: Most overexaggerated bs imo. Highly dependent on what class u are in which is literally out of ur control. They do not band by JIP JAE for classes  CCAs everyone has the same shot of getting in. It only is like this at the first few days of orientation  beacuse no one knows one another  even the JIP students. Generally JIP students do interact with JAE if they are willing to. Alot of JAE students go around saying they cannot make friends/cannot relate because they are JAE. Imo is not really the case especially for my class. Unless u refuse to even initiate a conversation there should not be any segregation at all.For the last 2 points  it is generally very dependent on ur batch. Because each batch differs.Campus: Damn nice.,btohqsg
the dhs one not very connected tho,btohqsg
would rather just go mountbatten and walk in,btohqsg
my friend made this when he was in J1,btohqsg
someone told me katong park stn got shelter all the way to dhs tho,btohqsg
i meant connected as in to other areas,btohqsg
are u gonna go open house tmr,btohqsg

happy for them but hard to not feel inferior in a sense,btohqsg
All Ik it's prob ard 35 and more ish,btohqsg
what if they lie to u that they didnt get it tho,btohqsg
depends on their qualification and what they‚Äôre teaching lor,btohqsg
I just find it ex la sry lol,btohqsg
i‚Äôve never tutored for more than 35 bc i always think i not qualified to charge more LOL,btohqsg
why need tutors when you have indian YouTubers,btohqsg
and the videos must be less than 1k view,btohqsg
i think bc if let‚Äôs say i wanna tutor A levels right,btohqsg
they always ask for a level results,btohqsg

Do u have a range in mind,btohqsg
maybe to not let you feel bad but it‚Äôs a stupid lie,btohqsg
wtf lol bachelor in physics dont know phy better than someone who got dist in h2 phy or even h3 phy meh lol,btohqsg
just makes it not trusty of them,btohqsg
some parents judge like if you can't do well for a levels then who are you to tutor a levels kind of thing,btohqsg

it's a diff set of skills,btohqsg
idk sia so means so far all my students is green flag fr,btohqsg
all is willing to listen kind,btohqsg
ok but nowadays if i offer to teach but then decide not to,btohqsg
the agent calls me bc the parents really want,btohqsg
idgi tho why wouldn't u charge 35 and more esp since u PhD rn,btohqsg
Teaching damn time consuming for me,btohqsg
like those A level grad usu 35 and more,btohqsg
that's why rn i'm not tutoring,btohqsg
ya at least dh someone said to me that im not from ri dont talk to me,btohqsg

i started tutoring in undergrad so i started with sec sch which is cheaper (bc i also did well enough in sec sch). i had >4.5 gpa alr but idk i start cheap so higher chance of getting hired,btohqsg
then for tutoring jc stuff i just never felt comfortable bc of a elvel results,btohqsg
u dc abt morals teach them abc for like 30$ an hour,btohqsg
i haven't tutored in a while but still,btohqsg
would charge more js dk how much,btohqsg
need to get scrutinised by parents tho lmao,btohqsg
even teach pri sch probly want all As n shit,btohqsg
tbh first lesson i kinda figure out what kind of parents and kid they are,btohqsg
some parents expect me to just drill them in TYS,btohqsg
some genuinely want to get a pass,btohqsg
which works but not my style,btohqsg
depends how badly the kid score,btohqsg
if i teaching i want you to understand what you're doing,btohqsg
usually is the parents cant teach and take their child den they find tutor for help,btohqsg
i meant all As as in the tutors,btohqsg
unfortunately yes  unless u have teaching experience,btohqsg
Feel like this is more an O level thing,btohqsg
if not the only thing u can provide is your grades,btohqsg
a level may not necessarily help,btohqsg
after sum gud tutors i realise legit its just need ur own discipline,btohqsg
My parents ah? You settle yourself,btohqsg
i set my own questions to lowk fuck with those that drill without understanding,btohqsg
They give me tuition if I ask,btohqsg
""" btr get this shit right or else imma lose my shit """,btohqsg
But that msg gave me that vibe,btohqsg
i never said it was easy but,btohqsg
have yalll met before shitty tutors,btohqsg
i'm experienced enough to do it?,btohqsg
idk coz i nvr heard of any shit ones,btohqsg
im thinking of what not to be,btohqsg
i mean even drill still need understand lah  doesnt mean blind drill not learning ig,btohqsg
shit i barking up wrg tree lol,btohqsg
Just don't be an excessive asshole,btohqsg
