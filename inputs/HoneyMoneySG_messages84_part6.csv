Yeap! Thx for digging that out. Much clear infographic haha,btohqsg
Anybody know if I had spend $700 on qualified transactions on UOB Evol last month  and out of $700  $200 was cancelled n refunded this month. I have no other transactions on Evol this month. Will I still get Evol cashback this month end for last month cashback?Will UOB crawl back my cash back next month end because of negative $200 cancelled transaction?,btohqsg
If this month cancelled and refunded $200 for last month transaction  this month need to spend $800 to qualify... But if you don't spend anything this month... That's something new haha,btohqsg
last month cashback not affected. Only issue is need to spend min $800 this month for cashback; if not using the card this month then nothing affected.,btohqsg
Hi I try to use uob lady (family) to buy ntuc vouchers.  Just wondering if 6mpd will be given on this? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
So if you are in the 7% and above tax bracket  it is recommended to top up?,btohqsg
The simple question is  would you want to throw money somewhere you'll never be able to use personally or would you want to throw money somewhere you can use in the future (with interest!)? ü§™,btohqsg
if u buying from fairprice website or over the counter then should be able to get 6mpd,btohqsg
Your tax savings is not very significant  and those accounts have limits  so might be worth it to wait for the future when you earn higher income  so the same contribution gives you more tax savings. But also depends if you have plans to increase your income to that level. üòÖ,btohqsg
The citigold and citiplus is u need to invest with them right to get the high interest 7.51% and 4%?Cannot just deposit like a fd or saving,btohqsg

Can I buy Lazada voucher using UOB Lady‚Äôs card (fashion category) via heymax and earn 6mpd ?,btohqsg
This one is only shop with Max (you click through and buy as usual on Lazada). There‚Äôs no Lazada vouchers yet.There‚Äôs a separate tab for vouchers in the app.,btohqsg
Icic  I will need to explore more,btohqsg
But If I click through heymax to shop on Lazada to buy my pet supplies  do I still get mcc code as 5311?,btohqsg
It would be dynamic. If you have Amaze card  you can always do a test before paying to check the MCC.,btohqsg
Ok üëåüèª I will try out first thanks thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
actually ocbc cards all quite lousy,btohqsg
Which Citi or Standard chartered cards are best with no minimum spend?,btohqsg
Anybody use roboinvestment?What's the best strategy to maximise earning?1) to leave it there and earn dividends2) sell when portfolio achieved profits,btohqsg
Basically you mean the tracker in uob app that is counted. Not the total bill in cc?,btohqsg
Well the point of using robo-investors is mostly to just put in money and let the robo-investor do the portfolio balancing for you... So usually you just want to put money in and take it out when you really need it.Unless you've reached a certain milestone in your life where you want to adjust the portfolio to take on lesser risk  like when you have a shorter runway and can only afford taking a low risk portfolio.,btohqsg
Can I ask if I should consider CRMC or HSBC Revolution for general spend and collect miles,btohqsg
Is cancelling after 1 year considered ‚Äú new CC holder‚Äù ?Is there a way to double check?,btohqsg
I would prefer Amaze+CRMC for general spend (except travel). Covers a wider range than HSBC.,btohqsg
Usually it's 1 year AFTER cancellation. Maybe you can check the TNC?,btohqsg
I see. But you know if a way to check? Or need to call them to confirm?,btohqsg
The uob tracker is to track the spending on calendar month?  That is the one that we should achieve 500?,btohqsg
Which card is better to cover travel for earning miles? Is HSBC travelone ok?,btohqsg
Yes you can use that to track. It basically tracks what I have explained.,btohqsg
It should be written in TNC. What does the TNC say?,btohqsg
you must be a new Standard Chartered principal cardholder. In other words  you must not have any existing or previously cancelled Standard Chartered credit cards in the last 12 months;,btohqsg
Does it meant that if we applied other card within the bank  we are consider old customer and not able to benefit for any goodie?,btohqsg
Until 12 months past cancellation of the LAST credit card you hold. Not forgetting you need to hold the card for 12 months to keep the rewards. So you can only get new to cc rewards once every 2 years.,btohqsg
Just to share  I verified with the cso of CIMB and bus/mrt transactions are eligible for the $988 sign up promo,btohqsg
Can I check again  if I use UOB Lady card to purchase my pet supplies via Heymax on Lazada  do I have to link to amaze and pay with amaze?,btohqsg

For what though. Everyone else wants to take/ utilize the MA but can't.,btohqsg
Dec I bought NTUC cos like somehow cheaper than FWD & singlife.Really depends on diff company's promotion,btohqsg
Why can't? You can use for integrated shield plan and careshield life ü§î,btohqsg
The MA like can't use all though. Even shield plans have annual limit that can be used by MA,btohqsg
