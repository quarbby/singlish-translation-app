Anyways  now pphs also got cap on ur estimated completion date. Like the latest pphs   is u need collect key by 2024 or smth.,btohqsg
No ah some BTOs built over 7 years,btohqsg
I think that's delayed from covid right? If not all hdb estimated 5 yrs leh,btohqsg
What I know is pinnacle build more than 5 years,btohqsg
If upon launch more than 5 years  u check with hdb officers upon selecting the bto  I think that's more confirm answer,btohqsg
For now they clearing covid backlog. Should be better soon. Hopefully.,btohqsg
U can try. But they downright said no. My bto is 6+ - 7 yrs also a no. And that‚Äôs before the market so hot like now.,btohqsg

Ya sis. The crowd from crowded to not crowded in this chat. But then the application like increasing. Wondering where most ppl are,btohqsg
Typically take around 3 to 4 yrs upon launch la...,btohqsg
Those delay one due to unforeseen circumstances lor,btohqsg
I thought is can apply BTO first while living in resale until when is built then need to sell of the resale.,btohqsg
Only if ur resale alr mop,btohqsg
Cannot bto then get resale then sell resale when collect key,btohqsg
Public housing got a lots of Rules and Regulation.,btohqsg
May I know that four room BTO must need two applicants or one applicant and one essential occupier is ok?,btohqsg
Flat and Grant Eligibility1. Couples and Families2. Seniors3. SinglesWhich one are you applying,btohqsg
Please beware that some of HDB design wasted a lot of SPACE,btohqsg
We use our money to buy a SPACE  that cannot be used at all,btohqsg
Cannot attach photos to warn you peoples,btohqsg
I just notice my kitchen why so small compared to other design,btohqsg
"The wasted space went into the ""longer walkway"" which served us no purpose",btohqsg
share your floor plan? cant figure out what you are saying.,btohqsg
1 flat with longer kitchen & 1 flat with short kitchen   I was wondering why?  Finally saw the picture  useless long walkway,btohqsg
Space is money & this walkway is deem useless,btohqsg
My purpose is to warn about HDB design to create meaningless useless space which you had paid with your hard earn money   look at their layout properly that every inches of space can serve you,btohqsg
Hi I balloted for the nov bto for Queenstown and have gotten a decent number  is it still possible for me to apply for another this may 2023?,btohqsg
BTO from Aug 2023 is for serious buyer only  40% of them will be bar for 1 year.,btohqsg
On Saturday  he said the ‚Äúnon-selection count‚Äù was in response to the concerns of Singaporeans that while there are many applicants ‚Äútrying very hard to get a BTO flat‚Äù  including families and singles  up to 40 per cent of applicants each year do not book a flat when invited to do so.,btohqsg
Which project and how many rooms?,btohqsg
Hi. Lets say after i have book unit paid $2k. Upcoming sbf/obf can i still apply?,btohqsg
Anyways this is the link for the article:https://dollarsandsense.sg/happens-cancel-bto-application-different-stages/,btohqsg
You posted the same question in Yishun chat HAHAHA I replied there,btohqsg
I found a link that can watch current hdb hub bto model building... Link üëáhttps://youtu.be/OtQeX0ByIu4,btohqsg
Hi dear experts here  its my first time BTOing hope someone more experienced can assist me.My queue number for Nov 22 BTO is slightly beyond the total number of units. If I submit cancelation of application now on HDB website  will it be a non-selection count? I have NOT been invited for selection yet.,btohqsg
Yes  it will be considered a non-selection count. Non-selection count refers to any situation where you are eligible to be invited down for selection but you did not select  for whatever reason,btohqsg
Thank you Bern for your kind assistance. My thoughts is since HDB give 3 times ballot numbers for every unit  wouldn't it unfair to penalize two-thirds of all applicants just because we do not select the leftover units?,btohqsg
Because they know 40% don't select,btohqsg
After Aug 2023 the above will be History  only serious BTOing will apply.,btohqsg
Nope  sounds perfectly fair. For example  for 100 units and the first 89 people picked  there is no difference between the 90th in queue and 300th in queue if everyone else don't select the flat.,btohqsg
Those who like to select the type they want should go Resale ASAP before Resale go for another bull run and cooling measure again.,btohqsg
Maybe the bulk of the 40% who did not select unit  came from the two-third applicants whose ballot numbers are beyond unit number?,btohqsg
