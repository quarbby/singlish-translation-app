hey guys need some advice..I have been doing lala full time almost 1 month already..Can I know for car drivers  what is a good expected income?Per day I can make around $200. (slow days maybe $10-$20 lesser)1 month is around $4k. (Mon-Fri)Petrol $20/day. ($400/mth)Rental $1 120$4k-$400-$1 120= $2 480 nett income.Is this very little?,btohqsg
Waste time is one thingLast time jus start llmMy bad ratings all from stacked jobs lol,btohqsg
Now all trip lesser dont waste time,btohqsg
Then dun drive do macdonald better,btohqsg
Llm only good for fri sat n sunday,btohqsg
All app is gd if u r hardworking,btohqsg
Rental van betterMany sourcesNow car also cannot go in Malaysia,btohqsg
Pple will not put food on ur table remember,btohqsg
Like that all app is no good for me,btohqsg
oh what do you mean many sources?,btohqsg
Does that mean nobody really does lala full time driving car?,btohqsg
I don't qualify for PDVL thats why doing lala,btohqsg
Theres more van orders on lala than car?,btohqsg
Thanks for the answer ya guys cause family man need to try to do better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
What u're earning now on lala is as good as it gets for car,btohqsg
Van can take jobs from more categories - car  mpv  van x 2,btohqsg
But u probably need a helper for van la,btohqsg
Can register fp gfAsk helper go take food,btohqsg
I always see husband wife team   or mother son team on llm during pick up,btohqsg
Not keen on MPV jobs anymore... spend more time loading and unloading  easily can do another job.,btohqsg
Llm is fare higherBut earn more lesserLike bike 10+ Multiple job,btohqsg
If $250 per day is more worth it since u are renting.,btohqsg
I think if you have bike license  do gf better haha cuz daily guaranteed $200+ on weekends before incentive,btohqsg
Seems like really bad idea to do lala full time with car ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Use ebike do fpAlso earn more,btohqsg
But stuck in Chinatown for some time due to Chinatown jam,btohqsg
Good idea  get many many helpers  so can pick up more food  then huat ah!,btohqsg
Got van can do cluster parcel delivery,btohqsg
Point A collect  ====> Cluster B deliveryBurn less petrol  less parking  more walking  more planning,btohqsg
On the way home can pickup 1 or 2 LLM  completes 1 day,btohqsg
Reach client place unit number wrong  call them unreachable . I left to complete other jobs on hand. Then client callback ask me send back the food at a later timing. Tell Cs return trip n mileage need to amend. He say is my fault on the spot never Livechat them lolz,btohqsg
I call restaurant they also say call customer never pick up,btohqsg
As if livechat them on the spot can solve . If waited all the jpbs behind all become late haha,btohqsg
I know what u mean. Same thing with waiting fees,btohqsg
Peak hours find CS waiitng time 10-20mins ,btohqsg
And if they cant the client i jus wait there meh? Hahah,btohqsg
Just now this CSO also trying to find fault to not give me cancellation fee,btohqsg
And i 1230 still got order to pick up,btohqsg
Ya some CS really make our life difficult,btohqsg
Tell me to Livechat them on the spot,btohqsg
Then my next order how to click?,btohqsg
Ask them to fix their stupid app,btohqsg
I go out come in livechat Q agaain,btohqsg
Once in Live chat cannot exit to other app,btohqsg
They shd just have anothet app which is Livechat CS,btohqsg
All of us drivers they want us type,btohqsg
Busy timing stop car just to type with CS,btohqsg
They best at finding fault and never understand their partners,btohqsg
The CS team sucks big time.... some are really rude.,btohqsg
My understanding is make sure you screen shot name and conversation if wanna shoot the CS with the management,btohqsg
