Hi all. I started my investment journey with Blue Chip under OCBC. Subsequently  I closed off the Blue Chip account in OCBC with the invested money returned to me. However  I realised that the Blue Chip shares are still reflected in my CDP Custodian account. I do not wish to hold any more blue Chip shares. Does that mean that I need to engage a broker to sell off the shares in my CDP account?,btohqsg

Assuming $0 in Nov 24  $30k from 17 Dec onwards  and $130k from 2 Jan onwards:Dec 24 - EIR 2.22% p.a. on your 30kJan 25 - EIR 3.71% p.a. on your 130k,btohqsg
Thanks. Assuming fulfilling the $2k transfer in and 5 transactions in both Dec & Jan  it won't qualify for the additional 1% interest? Or has the EIR already counted in?,btohqsg
EIR already counted in. Only the 100k is eligible  that's why a drop to 3.71% p.a.,btohqsg
maybe i rephrase it?December = 4.05% p.a for $30k but only from 17th December to 31st DecemberJanuary = 3.05% p.a. on $30k for a month + 4.05% p.a. on $100k for a month,btohqsg
