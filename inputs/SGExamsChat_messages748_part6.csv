it seems the only way for people to understand right from wrong in sg is inducing trauma,btohqsg
like if you want a speeder to stop speeding  just bombard them with videos and pictures of the results of crashing your car at 110km/h,btohqsg
Used to be effective when ppl knew each other la,btohqsg
the divine realm vege one is cheaper but still very good quality,btohqsg
Yea i get where you are coming from,btohqsg
But now the only sense of belonging is food,btohqsg
If i see some randoms in orange vest picking rubbish i wont even care,btohqsg
And im sure majority think the same way,btohqsg
i think now is getting trended on social media,btohqsg
So its not rly humiliating anymore,btohqsg
in the past  before singaporeans could get their driving license..they had to go through a road safety course. in that course  they will be shown scenes of metal vs humans.the idea was to incoporate drivers the sense of understanding that the vehicles they drive are not toys,btohqsg

now singaporeans still go through a road safety course/programme..but they are no longer showed all these gruesome pictures or videos because the public in general felt it was too graphic,btohqsg
Especially with covid these days u can wear a mask and basically incognito mode it,btohqsg
my time they made me watch it... yeah im old enough,btohqsg
after i pass my driving course they let me sit down in front of computer and see road incident,btohqsg
nope..they dont show brain matter on the road...anymore  it was removed because of it being deemed too graphic. Its the same reason why nowadays you dont see any road traffic ads,btohqsg
sometimes boomer methods works the best,btohqsg
drunk driving ads..speeding ads all use to be shown constantly..one of the drunk driving crimewatch segments was eye opening as well,btohqsg
its the idea of forcing trauma into someone..that is usually the only way you can change mindsets,btohqsg
the best example i can think of is that poster near restricted areas. just a sign of one man trespassing and another man shooting him. enough said about the consequence of going into those areas,btohqsg
the new one is some man holding gun,btohqsg
"but in words ""forcing trauma"" does not sound right",btohqsg
Now a days if u litter most judges will just fine the shit out of you,btohqsg
bruh i see them right next to my mrt station..and sometimes i see workers in construction trucks just drive in and park to have a smoke ðŸ’€,btohqsg
yea thats effective to us i guess,btohqsg
for context this is the old one,btohqsg
i personally feel the old one looks more intimidating,btohqsg
Now they no point gun at ppl,btohqsg
severed limbs  brain matter on the road are how you get the idea that road safety is important,btohqsg
it sounds morally wrong to force people to watch gruesome sights like these..but its effective and stomach turning for a reason,btohqsg
All new ones will be the guy standing,btohqsg
in the US  they put crashed cars near public places to constantly tell people the importance of drivign safely,btohqsg
the point is to show the effects of bad driving...you put guns for what effect?,btohqsg
if not best put a human corspe with a bullet wound..that will get the idea across well,btohqsg
but parents will never allow it,btohqsg
"but usa is ""freedom of speech""",btohqsg
"the prob you dont understand abt the us is the cops are there to ""protect and serve"" not to ""Protect and save""..the difference is  they have no obligation to question a person in public if they are holding a knife",btohqsg
so in that instance..if that person with a knife charges at you..the only thing you can do is have a gun to shoot...because cops are not by your side 24/7,btohqsg
"infact ""Protect and Serve"" is in almost every country and the motto of most cops..but so many people fail to realise...this does not mean they will save you",btohqsg
random but fml every good carou deal is at the opposite of the island for me lmao,btohqsg
actually will any of the new mrt lines cut through the island?,btohqsg
That's y I just do mailing when I canðŸ’€,btohqsg
ig got the cross island line,btohqsg
wait the cross island line cuts through bukit timah reserve?,btohqsg
I wanna switch my phone theme when i get a new case,btohqsg
uh cross island line will have to wait well into the 2030s,btohqsg
jrl is the next major project lta is undertaking  they are now rushing the dtl extension and circle line loop closing,btohqsg
JRL will be done in 2028,btohqsg
pasir ris gonna 3 have mrt stations,btohqsg
