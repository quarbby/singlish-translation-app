I remained thereuntil closing time and when I was about to go home  rainstarted pouring down. It was so intense I had to wait inthe library. I had waited for a while with the librarian  ayoung attractive single girl  then one thing led to another and I ended up sleeping with her”. The man stoppedtalking but kept weeping.""Well don't cry  it's a sin but it is not that bad. You shouldsay 5 Hail Marys and it will be forgiven”. Said the priest.“But it doesn't end there” the man kept sobbing. ""a fewdays later my elderly neighbor asked me to help her withher computer. Her husband was hospitalized and shecouldn't send an email to her son. I went there and fixedthe problem  but when I was about to leave  rain startedpouring down. It was really stormy and I had to wait. Onething led to another and I ended up sleeping with the oldlady"" the man cried.""Oh dear well that makes it harder indeed  but still - youshould say 15 Hail Marys and you will be forgiven"" Saidthe priest.""Oh I'm afraid the worst part is still ahead"" cried the man.""Yesterday I went to the barber. I was his last client thatday. As soon as he finished and was about to close theshop rain started pouring down so intensely  I had towait with him. One thing led to another and I ended upsleeping with him as well"" the man cried.“Oh dear  it is indeed worse than I thought” said the priest.""So what should I do father?"" the man asked.""Well” answered the priest  “you should get the fuck outof here before it starts raining!"".",btohqsg
