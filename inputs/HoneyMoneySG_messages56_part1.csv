"I shared this promo to someone. The other person did not go to the ""promotions"" page at all. Deposited 10k and subscribed 5x2k. Did not receive notification of successful egilibility (while i did). So we contacted moomoo. They say need to withdraw the money and do all over again (i recalled cannot cos need to put additional 10k since the last 10k is registered in system alrdy). So we did as instructed. It didnt work. My friend did not want to put additional 10k just to test the system so end up gave up on this promo",btohqsg
When i sign up for gxs savings account  i will end up with main account only? Then i need to separate create the pocket? Why need to ask users to do extra step. Or is there other tnc for the pocket,btohqsg

In this season where SPY is on the bull  would you invest $10K in 6 months T bill while waitIng for another low for entry into SPY?,btohqsg
also need to think of your strategy on when to sell. don't just think of when to buy.,btohqsg
if you only think about when to buy  you will be stuck with your existing holdings when another  low comes  and then you wondering why you bought so early.,btohqsg
so the first question you need to ask yourself is: are you planning to trade short term or hold long term?,btohqsg
