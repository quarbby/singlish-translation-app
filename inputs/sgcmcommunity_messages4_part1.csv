Lol I dun think there's enough rich in Singapore to buy that many cat b,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so too  but you‚Äôd be surprised,btohqsg
Singapore is the most expensive place on planet earth to buy cars‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
cannot be whole of Singapore only buying premium cars mah...,btohqsg
anyway what's the current number prefix? SNE?,btohqsg
Same  I spotted a few Honda HRVs/Vezel and Teslas with this plate already,btohqsg
Wah I have yet to spot any SNF vehicles,btohqsg
Im looking forward to see 2022-04 data when the COE finally hits $100küòÜ,btohqsg
Still be the same‚Ä¶ cos the more expensive it is the more they Want to buy it,btohqsg
I guess its a form of motivation to them!,btohqsg
https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/Car_Cost_Update/M032-Car_Cost_Update.pdfThis data also useful to know how much margin they are actually earning. It gets updated every month.,btohqsg
I believe it‚Äôs Tesla. Becoz their contract allows them to bid up to 15% from the 3 month moving average of COE.,btohqsg
Their model of sales so far is good. No frills no AD markups.,btohqsg
No unfortunately  but working towards 1. üòÜ,btohqsg
And a strong believer of EVs.,btohqsg
Don't think its Tesla. They delivery numbers are small.,btohqsg
Remember to share some pics of your ride here after you buy itüòâ,btohqsg
Actually ya fair too. Or could it be still those ADs bidding for event cars?,btohqsg
Last year a lot of companies performed better than 2020 so the bonus paid this year is generally much better‚Ä¶..there are a lot of buyers,btohqsg
Pty price high‚Ä¶. Sell got profit ..::,btohqsg
I think it is all round the market. Not just these. Just too few COEs,btohqsg
Can bid before cars arrive also,btohqsg
Yes but with a 6 month validity on the COE  you are taking a risk that your Tesla will be delivered in time. Don't think many will take the risk. At the end of the day  the registered numbers are small and that's a fact. So Tesla isn't the main cause of the high COEs  the other ADs are more than responsible for it as well.,btohqsg
Just for clarification  I don't own a Tesla. I wish I did but to see how Tesla is always mentioned as the cause of the high COE  I don't think that's an accurate comment. The way the COE bidding works with the last successful price bid and the total number of Tesla cars registered  it is clearly that the other ADs are similarly bidding up the COE price.,btohqsg
Cause alot of buyer like to use +15% during coe bidding   that why the conception hehe,btohqsg
I see the flaw in my own assumption now. Thanks for clarifying!,btohqsg
But what I don‚Äôt understand is  how does the AD still maintain their margins if they also keep bidding high?,btohqsg
Or   willing to pay more too? Less price sensitive,btohqsg
Then they ‚Äúhide‚Äù say COE goes up,btohqsg
Yes ‚Ä¶highly . Inelastic demand‚Ä¶. For that few brands,btohqsg
The price sensitive ones like Perodua registered a grand total of  X cars,btohqsg
Actually can last longer than 6 months but must go to LTA to 'renew',btohqsg
Mitsubishi who used to sell tons of lancers now is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Daihatsu which provided the charades and character cars like YRV  GTTi  copen now is finished,btohqsg
Suzuki of the immensely popular swift is also finished,btohqsg
FORD the great American üá∫üá∏ company has no cars that fits euro 6 for sale in Singapura at the moment,btohqsg
For luxury car the margin cost around the coe   lot of margin to play,btohqsg
Oh I did not know that!,btohqsg
Think nowadays  Tesla is doing +5% only?,btohqsg
I think their contract is 5   10 or 15 and -5.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a Tesla owner here maybe he can shed some light,btohqsg
the people 'bidding up' the COEs is transparent. The new car registration by brand table confirms it. Every one of those cars bought a COE and therefore bidded on them. Its actually pretty straightforward. As the COE price goes up though  you can expect the premium brands to capture more of the COEs  since people bidding high prices on COEs will probably be buying more expensive cars seeing as they can better afford them,btohqsg
U can choose retain same rate +5% or +15%   so if u want confirm coe is just +15%   the good thing is that you won‚Äôt need to pay +15% if the price close is lower then +15%,btohqsg
Example coe is 100 k and close at 108 k   if you bid for +15%   you still pay 108k,btohqsg
Get ready. Malaysian TP's love to meet and greet Singaporeans when driving in. Ha..ha..ü§£üòõüòú,btohqsg
Would need dealer to write in on behalf to explain tho.,btohqsg
"I have always felt that the ""packaged"" price offered by the ADs that include COEs is fundamentally wrong. ADs should just sell the cars and mark up cars according to market demand. COEs on the other hand should be left to the owner to bid themselves.",btohqsg
IMO ADs are offering package deals of car + COE because thats what buyers want. IMO buyers should take the blame for this system. Even now you are more than able to bid for your own COE  but no one ever does it. They just want everything packaged together. So this is the system we have. If everyone bidded for COEs on their own and demanded to pay machine price only  dealer would stop or scale back package deals. But this will never happen because if buyers bid on COEs themselves  they wont be able to take loans for their COEs which guarantee will eliminate 80-90% of car buyers from buying a car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not the buyer but the ADs dun want to sell to non pacakge pple,btohqsg
Or they sell u last and at same or higher price than u go for package so‚Ä¶. A bit LPPL lah,btohqsg
