Hi guys ! Anyone Kena user who said pay by Paynow after job and end up Kena run payment before ? Did a Kovan Sentosa job to deliver a cake . Send to hotel n concierge took over cake to pass to customer who has booked the hotel villa for birthday celebration. I told the concierge I was not paid yet and she went to check for me .Concierge came back and told me customer said hv to check first . Next thing I received a phone call and the man on the phone asked me why I ask payment from his client . I said I don‚Äôt know who is the real client as Lalamove job description showing collect cash from baker . Baker said collect at Sentosa .Anyway the guy promised to pay n after many hrs also no pay . Next day I contacted lala CS and he said he will pay . Again nothing . After a few more times   CS contacted m he kept promising to pay   said he in ambulance   etc and also no pay . I also msg him again yesterday n told him I will be making police report against him and he finally said that he already paid to lala . I asked for proof he did not show .Again I contacted CS on live chat n was told he still did not pay ! üò°üò°üò°,btohqsg
Now CS also advise me to report police for this case .,btohqsg
Job was $35.70 and after contacting Lala CS many times they made me fill up a form and finally reimbursed me $5.45 ‚Ä¶. Not even enough for my fuel let alone my time all wasted .,btohqsg
Any advise or sharing how to deal with this type of situation will be welcome . Thanks all in advance!,btohqsg
same thing happened to me...Lalamove just regretted for the negative experience...but I lost $56.90 and they returned back the commission taken...spoken to LLM cS ...how are you going to stop this in the future because this kind of people going to makan LLM drivers money but they said we blocked this number to do booking,btohqsg
do you think lodging police report can help to recover money??,btohqsg
this guy booked this order was83232808...this was his mobile number...he said payment shall be through paynow upon job completion...you just notify me once job completed...the job was done on 07 May 2022 and till to date no response...this guy said to LLM already deducted $56.90 from my wallet,btohqsg
Lalamove just regret for this case onlybutI spent my time about 2hrs...plus petrol...car wear & tear etc etc can't spare for this guy to make money using me...very sad this kind of things happening,btohqsg
on this day I did only one job and the money/effortwas makan by someone.....ridiculous,btohqsg
it makes me more scary people's are start to roe money like this...don't know which platform is better...this was the most bitter experience,btohqsg
If a few more ppl keep reporting to police on the same guys. Police will or may take action against him,btohqsg
kind request to all. Suppose in LLM.  if you happen to see the cash order with this mobile number83232808please don't take...sure he will makan your money and your effort...I already kena....lost my weekend/family time/efforts etc etc,btohqsg
I wonder for other delivery platforms are there such problems with cash orders? If so how do they handle?,btohqsg
raised the same question to LLM CS..no proper response from them...there is no guarantee for the money to driver,btohqsg
I guess this guy operating from his residence at Yishun...Blk 266 Yishun St 22.  #10-260,btohqsg
Oh I bought cake from this store before for my daughter's birthday,btohqsg
kind request to all. Suppose in LLM.  if you happen to see the cash order with this mobile number83232808& Yishun...Blk 266 Yishun St 22.  #10-260 address please don't take...sure he will makan your money and your effort...I already kena....lost my weekend/family time/efforts etc etc,btohqsg
he don't want to show me,btohqsg
u can't imaging this kind of people...how would they react...they will form up another story,btohqsg
I don't know what kind of arrangement with Client & LLM for money...I guess LLM might have collected deposit from their Client like they collected $75 from driver...that deposit may be called wallet...don't know,btohqsg
I just want other driver to be caution with this guy in the future,btohqsg
After that do go police report,btohqsg
Since you had all his address details,btohqsg
Just record down whatever LLM staff say and the guy say,btohqsg
LLM they are able to should the record if the police come down,btohqsg
it was a cash order...collect cash while collecting goods...,btohqsg
Den you should get the cash before off from his place,btohqsg
Wah I scared of cash order become of ppl like this,btohqsg
On a separate note  sometimes the job order u see the credit order logo  but then u see a cash order logo also. For such orders is cash or credit ah? I see such orders I nvr take alsoüòÇ,btohqsg
I took beforeShop owner says Paynow will be done after. Say to check account after delivery.Which is funny as they think is auto and they don‚Äôt have our Paynow number.The client contact don‚Äôt pick up calls  but 3-4 hours after delivery I WhatsApp themI think the shop owner shouldn‚Äôt use like third party delivery agent like this.,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs a shop why need to Paynow after delivery. Doesn‚Äôt make any difference.If personal adhoc or individual can understand use cash but if shop the orders usually collect on the spot during collection,btohqsg
No show means fake de  usually they will show even before you question them for it,btohqsg
yeah..I realize that..need to lodge police report on this,btohqsg
Oh this is exactly the same bakery - Joanna‚Äôs oven that I was supposed to collect cash from but they told me to collect from Sentosa side which is their client . When I asked the concierge  she said she will check with the guest and later the guy called and said why u collect payment  from my client ? So now I think the scum bag shd be the bakery‚Äôs owner !!! üò°üò°,btohqsg
I am going to go down to the bakery . Anyone Kena from them wanna go together ? Then we call for police there .,btohqsg
The phone number is not same tho,btohqsg
