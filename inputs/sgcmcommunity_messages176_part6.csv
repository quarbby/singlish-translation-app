How reliable is a company in turf club city? Saw a used car I liked but no reviews of the company,btohqsg
As reliable as Charles Ponzi and as honest as the guys behind Fyre Fest,btohqsg
Lol would having the car evaluated at STA / AA be good enough?,btohqsg
Not as good as bringing to your own mechanic  but better that not having any evaluation done. Please ask for the inspection report,btohqsg
Try to get your own ws to do ppi  walk away if dealer uses all sorts of reasons to deny,btohqsg
Lol read the news about cartimes lately?,btohqsg
And remember to put in sales agreement if inspection fail  full refund of deposit,btohqsg
Would the fail be due to something major or fail but still can be repaired etc,btohqsg
Usually Ppi fail if Engine or gearbox failure  or chassis damage,btohqsg
So must put in writing full refund if fail,btohqsg
If u wanna add other criteria,btohqsg
Subjected to u and dealer negotiations,btohqsg
If dealer confident  they will let u puy anything u want,btohqsg
The usual will be full refund if loan fail or full refund if nvr secure coe,btohqsg
