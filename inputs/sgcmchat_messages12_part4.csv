honestly nothing wrong to organise a car meet without owning a car. you can be a car enthusiast without owning one.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask   so sat change to sun then 10am to ? Any time ?,btohqsg
10 am sat abit too early ah lol,btohqsg
Sun I mean sun to have üåû,btohqsg
U wanted to gather at a carpark in the daytime that has nothing around it?,btohqsg
Meet at ecp or dempsey ppl can go macs  go brunch  take shelter,btohqsg
And fyi i didnt say anything about the when  only the where,btohqsg
Ya this one jam till v bad,btohqsg
I kenna stuck also. End up at tuas side take 4h+ to clear also,btohqsg
@k4gesdont stress over the first attempt bro. But take in the feedback,btohqsg
all good bro  if you guys have any feedback pls feel free to dm me,btohqsg
Night is safest la. But if u want the daytime ones  the cars and coffee formula works,btohqsg
i want to create a inclusive meet for everyone to enjoy  but clearly im not ready yet and neither are the other admins  thus id appreciate if you guys have any feedback,btohqsg
next time just settle on one day and time you think suitable then if people want come don't want come up to them,btohqsg
Night at a more accessible area perhaps?,btohqsg
Singaporeans will complain  but its during the bitching sessions that their true thoughts come out. Pros and cons,btohqsg
Asian style is not to complain directly to u,btohqsg
Ya there will just be genuine schedule clashes u cant cater to everyone,btohqsg
Actually mid day meet is okay,btohqsg
Cuz Sembawang Park nothing do there and so hot,btohqsg
Start of day will tend to have higher turn out cos ppl can go liao then proceed with the rest of their family day or whatever,btohqsg
Hence i said the cars and coffee formula is a working one,btohqsg
If Kallang Leisure mid day still okay,btohqsg
HDC does it too with their 8am meets,btohqsg
Let the admins regroup and replan üëç,btohqsg
Like the meet the rides is also mid day,btohqsg
Yea theres a reason for it,btohqsg
But abit paiseh eh no car organise meet,btohqsg
Ya can understand but I wouldn‚Äôt go more than once LOL absolutely not a morning person,btohqsg
Sun night wdl waterfront 9pm see y‚Äôall,btohqsg
Haha. With a kid its different ba. Getting up early with family is part of routine,btohqsg
@k4gesmay I know the story the admins,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs fair ah up to individual preference,btohqsg
Oh. Trust me getting up early is not the preference,btohqsg
Kids want to wake up early meh,btohqsg
Just saying its easier to wake up cos used to it,btohqsg
For a breakfast with family its fine,btohqsg
When single is wake up 2 pm,btohqsg
Maybe dating wake up 10 am go brunch,btohqsg
basically  when we started SCM me and a few others simply say that we want host meet if we reach 2k  then when we did we got plan then suddenly got a few complaints we all panicked  some admins were busy with irl stuff so we couldn‚Äôt communicate as much  so pretty much me and 1 other admin were planning this and thats when it all fell,btohqsg
Don't worry climb back up some day again,btohqsg
ah okay i dm u rq,btohqsg
pity u take the blame haha,btohqsg
nola issok man  it sucks but honestly its good to take criticism because it helps me learn for the future,btohqsg
but must work as team mah,btohqsg
if plan don‚Äôt work u can‚Äôt take the whole blame,btohqsg
Team work makes the dream work,btohqsg
yeah i know that  ive alr discuss with them and they learnt alr,btohqsg
This one legit is Â•ΩÂ≠©Â≠ê. Jiayous. Replan and then let us know again. The other car groups will support u if they can. üëç,btohqsg
see if they got any new plans,btohqsg
