I dont know if even motorbike wants to take that kind of fees.,btohqsg
"True  plus once u take that kind of amount means customer will keep on book with that pricing and will not increased a few dollars. To customer ""previously there's some drivers will pick up"" so next time they will still book delivery with that fees amount. Long run  all of us will die.. haahha",btohqsg
For cancellation fee  please contact CS at your own do not let the customer contact CS bcos CS will follow what ever customer said. My experience let customer contact CS  cancel straight away without compensation. And CS told me customer don't want to pay then lanlan. This is lalamove,btohqsg
Yes u must contact CS on the spot. If its a cash delivery ask customer to compensate asap. I always do that. So far no problem. Keep that photo for reff.,btohqsg
Be careful what ever you do  protect yourself,btohqsg
LLM can deduct you money from credit without your consent,btohqsg
If fees too low dont take. Wiat till they plus a few more $$ to make it more reasonable price. Then in future they will automatically know what to do.,btohqsg
Oversize  overweight  over timing don't take  just cancel. This is my advice,btohqsg
Oddle job always over timing  that is the appeal come from,btohqsg
If you don't have good excuse LLM will deduct your money,btohqsg
And if they cannot get in touch with the sender  they will just cancel without compensation. It happened to me  so I‚Äôm just sharing my experience.,btohqsg
We as drivers must unite and take a stand. Haiz!#StandUnited,btohqsg
They will always say this. But since last time already stated in the app regarding the size & weight in the apps. Customer just trying luck to save cost. Once u are there explain to them about the cancellation fees of 50% they start to wobble. Cause have to pay 50% and item not delivered. Let me just share what i do.. for example  i called b4 proceed to location to confirm about the job and item and they mention just small item but eventually upon arrival its oversized i give them 2 options. Either cancel and pay the compensation of 50% or top up fee $ follow on which ever mode of dwlivery they are supposed too.,btohqsg
Another customer that will always ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù is 10 Haig Road. Vietnamese sending food and groceries over. I saw first hand coz I was there and she booked van. Then came a rider and asked to courier a box of ingredients over. Then when the rider argued  she said ‚ÄúI thought you drive car.‚Äù Sibei sialan this sender.,btohqsg
To me  all vietnamese shop all like that.. hahahaahah,btohqsg
Another one is at Mandai Estate. TMD!,btohqsg
U only get 15.90 for 2 drops of location... worth it?,btohqsg
Meaning per location is $8. Come on lah... grabfood better right? Hahahha,btohqsg
So to me  lalamove is not for us to earn if the price is like this and there ppl still take it.. but as a customer i will book lalamove i save alot. And i know there ppl so hungry for this kind of fees.,btohqsg
Last minute order NOT take best as Tio 2 timez see take as nearby they say I LateüôÉüôÉüôÉ,btohqsg

It is every order not just pool order,btohqsg
This kind must go use van pick up and let them sit behind. Than turn off Aircon open window,btohqsg
Nope. Lala is for goods service. If customer wan take cheap transport home they should bear it,btohqsg

They always paynow very late  you need to call them a few times to remind them.Also asked me to take another order which is out of my way  then they cancelled from their end when i said i couldn‚Äôt.,btohqsg

hi all  just to check sinopec and spc is the same brand just different name right? thanks üôè,btohqsg
At the end of the day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶don‚Äôt be surprised if all the brands are from the same source but with their individual additives,btohqsg
Same source as in all from earth? üòÇ,btohqsg
Sinopec is China company. Their products are brought from shell. So it's shell,btohqsg
But the petrol is lousier than shell. Mileage much lesser,btohqsg
Spc now also owned by China company right?,btohqsg
Tell here so many times  still there are drivers taking the scam orders. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Pundek man this one pattern many,btohqsg
Turban Turtle Froggie!!!!! Half an hour wait for the food. Why don‚Äôt they book later then????,btohqsg
Where‚Äôs this Bro? Sorry to ask.,btohqsg
Car‚Ä¶.gave them a piece of my mind. Told to book when it‚Äôs almost ready. Or communicate with the driver with info on the ready time. Can do 1 job in between man‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Well  I‚Äôve heard of the long winded process‚Ä¶..so guess not,btohqsg
Time stamped with the texts‚Ä¶.left there at 6:45 only.,btohqsg
Courier but bring trolley  how lah.,btohqsg
Customer not answering call  message no reply. Cancel order become driver fault fkllm,btohqsg
Who ask you Take?ü§£See Just IGNOREDüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
mine oversize too atlast become my fault also kekiang,btohqsg
Dun noe y this order suddenly pop up to my lalamove apps.i nvr accept any order,btohqsg
Stupid sia now block me for taking order,btohqsg
Lately their GPS cock up. Like glitching. Then when we call them and tell them about it. Their reply ‚Äúnot my fault. I only key in the details and pricing issue is LLM fault.‚Äù My reply ‚ÄúOk! Good luck!‚Äù,btohqsg
its turn out to be driver‚Äôs fault eventually even though it not,btohqsg
got to find way to quit this platform on behalf fulltime all is not right ready,btohqsg
This cheapo said a few boxes  big box. If cannot do I call someone else,btohqsg
Few dollars also want to scan,btohqsg
Got any other delivery platform with better pricing guys?,btohqsg
The timing is alittle off for the distance ain‚Äôt it?,btohqsg
Just do your best to deliver as quickly as possible even if you‚Äôre stacking. But stack responsibly. Coz I ever kena warning by LLM. Suspension for 3 working days.,btohqsg
Guys I found a way eat free food,btohqsg
Order from lalamove oddle or wad  eat the food  claim food damage  ask for compensation. Lalamove will ask driver to compensate food without even giving the food back to the driver.,btohqsg
Claim food damaged. Like some toppings fell over some pastries . Customers obviously ate still. Still ask for compensation from driver. Llm asking driver pay the food,btohqsg
But where the fuck is the food?,btohqsg
Why driver still need pay for the shit ?,btohqsg
If want driver pay for food  please pass food back to driver ..,btohqsg
Remember  order pizza  claim pizza damage and eat for free,btohqsg
All we need to do is self damage the pizza a bit take a pic and eat it. Send to llm. Get driver to pay,btohqsg
The funny thing is driver don't even know it's so called damaged,btohqsg
You all know right? Damaged food delivery needs to return back to vendor . That applies for grab panda etc. But for llm they let customers eat and allow customers file for compensation,btohqsg
This type of case go court llm sure lose,btohqsg
How much did they deduct from u,btohqsg
Its normal... told u guys be careful of llm.,btohqsg
I ever got deducted 30+ for dried food etc chilli and stuff.. i dont mind u deduct what im asking for is price list of every item as i know its too much to claim me that amount. And furthur more customer ask to leave item outside house on the chair. Complete job at 11+pm. Tomorrow 3pm said item damaged. And llm call me saying i have to compensate of 30+ sgd. Hahhaa.. suck thumb lah... thats why i said.. be llm customer better. U gain alot,btohqsg
I will find the vendor   I want know money goes to where. If back to llm pocket they can close shop,btohqsg
Go back to the customer hse,btohqsg
Wtf  did u taken photo when drop off?,btohqsg
Whoever consumes the food gonna pay for food. Restaurant asking for compensation does this mean they prepare new food for their customer. Answer is no else I would have received call from restaurant,btohqsg
Then u should be quite safe with evidence of the instruction passed down.,btohqsg
I will find out where the money goes to,btohqsg
If compensation is for llm own pocket  then close shop. If for vendor   show me new food been made to their customer and if I paid for the claimed damaged food  shldnt it be mine since the compensation is a payment for old damaged food,btohqsg
So where is the food? Shit in toilet bowl..... Who shld pay? Why me? Food damaged ask me compensate then where the food?,btohqsg
Instead I compensate for ppl to eat?,btohqsg
Think can try to complain to MOM,btohqsg
Since this is abuse by employer,btohqsg
this lala app is not worth animore drivers got abused paid cut by 1/3 and drivers get 2/3 of paid compair to last years previous onwards.even perjob work load more then 1/3 extra from lastime job assignment.further more cost rises.its goes opposite way.,btohqsg
I tot no one noticed that,btohqsg
Last year fare was better. This year the fare went down. After cny even worse,btohqsg
Pay parking pay petrol end up earn how much only,btohqsg
I give up with lala already,btohqsg
Incentive also dont have. Say got mission. One mission also dont have. Even if have the mission like peanut like that,btohqsg
anyone who have a transport and want to sustain and rely on this app my advise from better forget u sustain of transport and let it go.,btohqsg
I totally give up on taking orders after cny alr,btohqsg
Pay like shit one thing  anything happen they will deduct money from you like our friend $100. I got deducted $16 out of $32,btohqsg
it true i believe that as i got deducted 58$ dollars before without my acknowledgment,btohqsg
Hi all.I have come to understand that many members here have multiple platforms to do their deliveries.And with the recent spat on unfair cases as brought up to the chat I will like to hereby reiterate that this group has no business or Personal relations to the company.This is an unofficial group  not in any affiliations to LLM interests.As such I will consider renaming the group to a more suited one one's where all platforms can be discussed in here.Suggestions will be welcomed in the main chat.,btohqsg
Got this one time. They suddenly deduct 25 dollars from me and reason they gave was late delivery. My phone batt died when i otw to delivery location. After delivering i went back home to charge my phone then i send delivered. That was like 30 minutes later. I pass the item to the receipient. Dk why i kena deduct. They didnt even give reason. They didnt even investigate. Simply just deduct.,btohqsg
I ride motorcycle and it was raining heavily. I unable to charge my phone as moisture was detected. Then kena deduct. The fare was only 15 bucks but i kena deduct 25 bucks.,btohqsg
Now delivery platforms business is very bad as compare to last year  other platforms price still remain no change but LLM price drop n reduce as delivery fee which cut price without mileages even lower than that. So be careful when you do LLM order,btohqsg
Few months later‚Ä¶ might have new legislation,btohqsg
Llm will likely become lanlan move,btohqsg
Prices have been dropping n dropping last couple of yrs liao,btohqsg
To be honest  previously llm prices were overly high üòÇ,btohqsg
It's not sustainable in the long run  they will lose customers,btohqsg
Back then during lockdown got demand so can high high,btohqsg
Now if they still want biz they have to reduce the price or else no vendor will want use them,btohqsg
But even then  still keep having many new drivers join ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
No point comparing with the past prices liao. Delivery prices nowdays is low this have to accept,btohqsg
Where got so many deliveries to justify high priceüòÇ,btohqsg
lanjoa overprice lastime is just nice people use real money not tissue paper deposit vechicle capark insurance road tax maintainances repair ccb think use paper and water,btohqsg
How many pple can tahan those prices,btohqsg
We all want high price of cos,btohqsg
All price go up salary no go up,btohqsg
If all delivery job $30 40,btohqsg
Who can tahan keep order delivery,btohqsg
If price low and not worth it then don't do lor,btohqsg
No matter how much we boycott or say here  fare also won't go up,btohqsg
hoseh liow la doing here sub fulltime really no future,btohqsg
Ft or pt also no future,btohqsg
Fare will go down 10percent per annum,btohqsg
Only those foreigners doing pt worth it to them,btohqsg

Those low fare jobs they will take also,btohqsg

Car/petrol etc they don't need pay,btohqsg
Low fare to them is free extra cash,btohqsg
During lockdown high demand so we don't feel it,btohqsg
Low life movers =llmThis nt a job for sinkies to sustain life.Unless on the way then can fetch nonsense to ppl,btohqsg
When now low demand n prices  we feel it,btohqsg
Grab   panda able to keep the fare as close to lockdown. Llm cannot .,btohqsg
Even GGV don't cut fares like llm do,btohqsg
goodluck to ft poor thing then to sustain rental of vechicle,btohqsg
Their prices were nvr very high to begin with,btohqsg
U sure? Their bicycle stack order till tdy is still at 18-22after  incentives,btohqsg
During lockdown the prices for llm is really very high lah to be honest,btohqsg
I nvr expected that to sustain,btohqsg
No la. Comparatively grab panda bicycle riders earning was 6k during lockdown. Not high expenses. What abt llm during lockdowns after expenses.Tdy these grab panda riders still maintain at 5k abv. How abt llm after expenses.After penning down u know the diff is a lot annually,btohqsg
Grab panda etc mkt share is bigger mah. U can see from the number of jobs llm have,btohqsg
Llm can't sustain . The management stupid. Don't know how do this business,btohqsg
Do note I'm not supporter of llmüòÇ,btohqsg
Yes that's y the high prices cannot sustain 1,btohqsg
Even the mission incentive now n then also big difference,btohqsg
That's why  llm cmi liao. Those want do delivery must still stick to grab panda,btohqsg
Must know when can n when cannot,btohqsg
Even the cny this yr also so much weaker in llm,btohqsg
Cost of living is just gg up way too fast,btohqsg

I drive car. But I feel nowdays bike probably better. Solely for the reason that costs lower(petrol parking). Because all the fares now very low. Whether is bike  car  van etc,btohqsg
Since all low  might as well go for the lowest cost vehicle if you have license for both bike n car,btohqsg
And chances of getting a crazy big amount of stuff to deliver is still lower for bike  even though nowdays all the vendors chut pattern,btohqsg
But again I drive car  so I can't be sure about bike,btohqsg
But llm now really not worth it for car  be it full time or part time,btohqsg
Got car go do grab better  llm for bangalas and retirees.,btohqsg

Delivery drivers for food is just a waiter or waitress,btohqsg
Customer see food not theirs suppose to report to restaurant. Not eat it and claimed for compensation,btohqsg
When does waiter need to pay for customer consumption of wrong food,btohqsg
Ya thays what I said lo,btohqsg
I say I never damage any item,btohqsg
So don't charge me for damage,btohqsg
But you also know this ljmove,btohqsg

Total time allowed to send is 3hrs. Even sent after 3hrs sharp after pick up no penalty. Since customer wants to tekan. Can take the job  take 3hrs to complete. Nothing he can do. The fker himself didn't prepare food early. Get the driver to do his shit job for him. Just fk him. Teach him a lesson. He has to prepare his food early.

Additional $15 dont forget to ask. Purchasing fees for eateries,btohqsg

Yes  u have proof of the call logs to provide lalamove to ensure that u call b4 making your move to collection point u will be compensate 50% cancellation fees.,btohqsg
Still can. 50% cancellation fees will be made via credit and u have to fill in jotform.,btohqsg
Yup2. Previously not this bad. Normally we partners will wait for customer to plus few more $$ then we accept. But nowdays so many hungry partners even small fees they faster grab. So  when customer sees that  they wont bother to add additional $$ and will stay thay low pricing cause to them  they will be so confident that there will be partners who will take the job.. this type of partners is the one spoiling the market. Work smart not hard. But end of the day its up to individuals.,btohqsg

Cash orders cancellation fee made via credit? In the 1st place llm can't even get the cancellation fee from the scammer. So how to pay u,btohqsg
Can bro. Its consider llm fault. We as partners  just doing our job following the procedure. But make sure u have the call logs with the sender to provide in the jotform.,btohqsg
The scammers won't pick up the call 1. If u say can claim. Then just keep taking all the scam jobs which are cash jobs then keep cancelling. Those +300 scam cash jobs.,btohqsg
When jobs demand drop  n drivers supply sky rocket  sure prices will drop,btohqsg
This one then legit buy for me45 min  queue15 min deliveryPaynow in before proceed to buy the foodAnd get additional $23 tips,btohqsg

What i did i call them via whatsap and screenshot the call log and provide in the jotform. No problem. Received the compensation fees.,btohqsg
This one cannot already bro... this one is not new.. its been so long already early last yr already have.. hahahha. I mean those ah long cases..,btohqsg

In delivery line for 20yrs already. If dont know asked. If not sure  asked.,btohqsg
This is credit order  cs can play me like this,btohqsg
As long as u call the user/sender they mention saying that order confirm and what item to be delivered u may proceed to the pick up location. If its a scam order or u arrived and they cancelled on the job u may get the compensation. In another case  if u call user no answer dont proceed and go live chat and update them the user is not reachable they will cancel for you. Simple.,btohqsg
Yes  been there b4...CS also mia me.. so all this is a learning curve for us. The experience that will make us more competent.,btohqsg
Never ask me call log then anyhow say,btohqsg
Llm platform is the worst platform.. so  as long as u know how to handle & tackle the situation i guess it should be fine.. we have to be more independent and street smart.. work smart  keep all evidence for later part in case there's any issue.,btohqsg
Anyway  im just sharing what can be done. No obligations.. sharing for those who need to know.,btohqsg
So this 1 is send plant?,btohqsg

So that's why i need to know this.,btohqsg
True.. so just do our part follow procedure if its a scam job just not your lucky day.. but make sure u did all the steps b4 proceeding. Then atleast u wont lose everything.. still manage to asked for 50% compensation,btohqsg

Do customer need to add another last stop for round trip? Or they only pay the round trip charge?,btohqsg

Only pay the round trip charge. If they are generous they will add the stop for you. Which costs more.,btohqsg
Just let u guys know most delivery with car don't require trolley. And llm started with extra payment when trolleys are needed for car orders.,btohqsg

Those of u who see lousy fees still keep take eventually will be ask to send 75%of current pay within a year.,btohqsg
One year later u know what I say will come true   simply cos some fking no brainers are even taking 12$ car job (net $9),btohqsg
That's equivalent to a decent bicycle job of less than 1kg of food üòÇüòÇ. With zero expenses like parking and petrol,btohqsg
Hi  guys is it compulsory to paste  sticker  in vehicle  for lalamove,btohqsg

No matter how low the fee also got people take one. Not everybody same mindset. Some people willing to drive 20km to earn $10-$15.,btohqsg
Did LLM change the fee calculation recently ah? A lot of fees short by a lot.,btohqsg
7km distance  scheduled for tomorrow. So should have $1 for scheduling  and at least another $2 for distance  plus $3 for extra stop. Total should be $15+ right?,btohqsg
"Found a lot of orders today like miscalculated very far short. Other days also have  but not as many. Does LLM give discount to customers  than pass the ""savings"" to us riders?",btohqsg
Yup. You‚Äôre right. The discount is given by the driver and rider,btohqsg
Lower price given to driver when you accept the term n condition. You die die must accept in order to take order. In other word you are force to accept,btohqsg
PT afterwork letters delivery job. anyone interested?,btohqsg

Buy for me order best is ask them paynow you before you buy anything. If not cancel the order,btohqsg
Llm got say make sure you get the purchase money from customer 1st then buy mah,btohqsg
It's not overflow. Started last year if I'm not wrong. Llm offered discount to their customers. But its not llm company who pays for the discount. Llm just deducts the discount from our mileage fees.,btohqsg
So if u see delivery fee and no additional distance fee  that means its discounted fare,btohqsg
Is this a common practice with the other platforms as well?,btohqsg
8 start 1030 end 4 trip $35.70 like waste time,btohqsg
