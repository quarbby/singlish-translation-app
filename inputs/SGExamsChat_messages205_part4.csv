Oh wait Essek I meant for Mcq not overall,btohqsg
Oh I thought u mean overall,btohqsg
honesty is the best policy yalls,btohqsg
Uh congrats for ur straight As?,btohqsg
i wish i could say thank you,btohqsg
tbh i had 3 distinctions in prelims,btohqsg
amath is my only confident a1 subj,btohqsg
But econs was a large contributor,btohqsg
i was over the moon i tell u,btohqsg
due to some error my practical 1 more mark,btohqsg
26 points for 5 subjs can le,btohqsg
Didnt u get 8 points for Os?,btohqsg
U from exp or NA Sec 5?,btohqsg
I feel like you got 8 points,btohqsg
Cuz last year my sch got one Sec 5 student get 7pts,btohqsg
I think its raw 10 nett 8,btohqsg
Cuz he took 3 subjects in 4NA,btohqsg
no loss for me cos ntg is easy in econs for me so ya,btohqsg
I mean u seem smart  way smarter than me at least  so I guessed u were from ACJC or the 7 pointer schools,btohqsg
How am I hypocritical lol I alr said my results probably would be bad I boderline pass chinese for Os and my English lc was shit so I’m guessing the only A1 I might get this time is just for econs,btohqsg
English  O level maths and O level Chinese,btohqsg
I wanted to drop to clb but my sch didn’t allow,btohqsg
Ya cuz SBB start this year,btohqsg
No I was happy with C6,btohqsg
I think hes talking about u being sad about mcq and trying to tell the other guy that it was ok since it was only 2 marks,btohqsg
For NA ppl taking O level science,btohqsg
But for me I was sad because it was a careless mistake,btohqsg
I had a friend who was more upset than most people who got even less cos he lost one mark in a test due to careless mistake,btohqsg
So it’s the same logic here for me,btohqsg
Bruh I got 0.5 marks for geog once,btohqsg
For my sch last year those from NA who take O level Maths or English must also sit for both O and NA EL and Maths.,btohqsg
my classmate got 19/35 for amath cried 2 fucking lessons when theres ppl getting single digit,btohqsg
Was i talking about chinese? I have known u since Sec 1. Not only I think this way okay? Also   u been getting A1 for physics and other subjects in prelims  don't make it look like u are getting F9s,btohqsg
i want to slap her so bad,btohqsg
My chinese WA1 I got 3/50 lmao,btohqsg
Out of 15 sorry shd say that too,btohqsg
I thgt my humans damn bad liao,btohqsg
I cant find the paper so idk,btohqsg
No I won’t be getting F9s but I’ll drop to A2 for a lot of subjects based on my estimation of the grade threshold,btohqsg
Plus my teacher alr said a fair bit of ppl for phsyics prelim A1 o level drop to A2 or B3,btohqsg
Becus my cher think I did shit,btohqsg
I’m pretty certain I will become that type of person,btohqsg
Funny u say that and still get A1 everytime,btohqsg
Plus I think the sch prelim this year is easier than most o level papers,btohqsg
Nothing compares to 0.5 marks  sometimes I think to myself that the teacher shd just give me 0,btohqsg
So that’s why I’m certain my o level results would be worse than prelim,btohqsg
Like e math u will probably need 92% for A1  so prelim even if I get 75-90% it’s still definitely not good enough,btohqsg
Maybe but not confirmed. If the distance is too far or if its 5 days a week then no,btohqsg
What u get for emath in prelims?,btohqsg
Did u compare that to the average score?,btohqsg
