Instarem rate vs youtrip rate  I think require spending on instarem to see the rate,btohqsg
Very accurate. If you suddenly refund something and it brings you below the minimum before the end of month then can't help you already.,btohqsg
Amaze rate is marked up against mastercard rate,btohqsg
youtrip has better rates than Amaze. People use the Amaze way to earn miles. up to you,btohqsg
Amaze+card better if can earn more than 2% or equivalent on the cardif not Amaze wallet is comparable to youtrip,btohqsg
does CRMC has cap limit of $1000 for 4mpd earned on foreign currency if pair with Amaze?,btohqsg

Oh.. i was confused.. again. üòÖSo insurance payments are excluded from quarterly cashback calculations  but not excluded from spending calculations of uob one account?,btohqsg
I seeüòµ‚Äçüí´Thank you so much for clarifying.Does it work the same for ocbc 360 spending and its CC?Are the 360 acct spending criteria and the CC bonus criteria different or same?,btohqsg

Raffles Place or Paya Lebar Square will have lirasIn istanbul  at least amaze will be ok  but will you be going to cappadocia?,btohqsg
Ahh okok I‚Äôll call and check w them.No  I wont be going to CappadociaThanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
If you are having street food (which is good in istanbul) good to still have some liras,btohqsg
Do u mean pay insurance using OCBC CC consider eligible spending?,btohqsg
"@StellaRilakkumaand I are trying to clarify. When you mean the ""same""  i suppose u mean the 360 account and ocbc CC has the same set of whitelist and exclusion criterias  if they dont earn ocbc points  they dont count as eligible spending (unlike uob one acct and uob cc has their own set of different tnc). My understanding correct?",btohqsg
ocbc 360 card spend bonus interest has same exclusion as card rebate/points,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB ONE Credit Card user here... Does anyone know how to calculate the amount of spending needed to get the $20 cashback/rebate?,btohqsg
Hi! I like to also ask about the giro arrangements for the cashback. Does it matter if it is an e-giro arrangement? Or I need to submit a giro form with my signature that have been registered with the bank at one of its branches?,btohqsg
Hi uob gurus  for uob one cc  if you expecting cashback for the quarter for this month  does it means you have to spend $500+cashback for this month to be eligible for the next quarter?,btohqsg
is this the additional bonus cashback?,btohqsg
Where's this $20 from? Additional cashback merchants?,btohqsg
no  cashback has no bearing on spending required,btohqsg
As long as it's not a self initiated GIRO through HSBC app/website. eGIRO requires you to initiate through BO app/website while postal requires you to send through the BO. Latter requires signature on HSBC EGA. Both are eligible.,btohqsg
Ok Thanks so i just maintain my spending at $500 no need to take into account of the cashback. üôè,btohqsg
This is UOB One Debit Card.,btohqsg
Then got difference between cash rebate and cashback?,btohqsg
