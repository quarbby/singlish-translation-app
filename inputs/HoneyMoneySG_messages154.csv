Hello  anyone tried to split the annual insurance premium into 2 months payment before the due date. Will there be any issues?TIA üôè,btohqsg
Not too sure has anyone tried this? Can we buy vouchers via dcs flex and still get the 6% Cashback?,btohqsg
Can i check sc journey welcome miles conversation is 1:1 to krisflyer?,btohqsg
Sc journey points currency should be 360 rewards points. 25k points = 10k KF miles,btohqsg
Ntuc ba most probably. Im not too sure hence asking the community for help,btohqsg
How about for lendlease points? Anyone know what is best to redeem?,btohqsg
Hey max miles cannot transfer to krisflyer  so which airline will you all transfer the hey max miles to?,btohqsg
AA when I have enough miles,btohqsg
This means im not getting 45k worth of kf miles ah?,btohqsg
In this case they say miles is 1:1 lah  I thought you asking about conversion.,btohqsg
Craps not able to add flex card into heymax,btohqsg
Ya. Tbf  if use for economy flights  it may get better values than KF.,btohqsg
Anyone know if is a good idea to sell insurance policy to 3rd party company? Or is it better to ask insurance company to freeze the policy at the money and to restate the policy (6months time). However insurance mention interest will be occur after reinstatement,btohqsg
If whole life plan etc still can sell  If ILP they also won't touch it with a 10 foot pole,btohqsg
Its PRUSaver lll  pay for 5 years and wait for 5 years. after that then can take out the money.. i already paid 1yr 3months. Any idea still can sell off to get back some money?,btohqsg
If wedding banquet  whats the mcc code that hotel shd charge under? Dining or hotel or travel mcc code?I plan to sign up hsbc revolution  and uob visa,btohqsg
Usually Hotel  so UOB Ladys should work too,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not in the field so i can‚Äôt give you any advice but a quick google search would have multiple results showing companies that are interested in buying them  but price wise if I remember correctly its pennies on a dollar  atb tho,btohqsg
So the category i shd set to Travel correct?,btohqsg
How to set the preferred category?,btohqsg
should be travel or dining. check mcc to confirm,btohqsg
Was in a very similar situation as well but paid about 1year 8mths. I just gave it up and moved on to normal investments. U pay 1year+ and to let go is painful but if u keep it  it will be even more painful down the road,btohqsg
The 5 years of payments can already injure your early investment journey severely.,btohqsg
Thank you both Ong and Mt. really felt pain if let go the plan after paying so much and yet get back $0,btohqsg
Hi gurus. For atome or grab pay later  if we use cards like dbs wwm  we can clock mpd over the course of the installment? Instead of maxing it once on full payment?,btohqsg
I am sure dbs wwmc can use with atome.Grab pay later doesn't I think.,btohqsg
Basically that‚Äôs the commission the agent fleeced from u.,btohqsg
I met all requirements for UOB One. How come i didnt get 6%?,btohqsg
The effective rate for full $150k is 4.00% pa.,btohqsg
There are never 6% to begin with. It is EIR 4%. Have you read the tnc?,btohqsg
So if dbs wwc has 1k limit for 4mpd  we split a 3k bill into 3 payments  we get 4mpd per month?,btohqsg
6% doesn't apply to you full balance. Only a portion of it. That's how the bank got you.,btohqsg
So if i have 150k  will get 4%?,btohqsg
Yes but their limit is 1.5k btw,btohqsg
No. It got reduced from 2k to 1.5k ard a year ago.,btohqsg
Ahh my friend must have gotten it wrong. Told me was 1k. Wow this atome trick is handy. Thank you so muchüôè,btohqsg
Your monthly average is $129k instead of $150k. You won‚Äôt get the full 4%z probably only 3.5% around.,btohqsg
How to get 15% cashback with Trust cashback card? ü§£,btohqsg
It is ‚Äúup to‚Äù 6%  not 6%.Basically you are getting an icing cake. You can‚Äôt just tell the shop u want to get the icing and don‚Äôt want the cake.Visit UOB One website to see the tier calculation info.,btohqsg
Wah u better not use trust cashback card,btohqsg
Can chocolate debit use for bus n mrt to get miles?,btohqsg
anybody noticed the points in their SC smart card looks off?I was looking at my Jan and Feb statement and im only seeing about 100+ points earnedbut for my statements in 2024 i earned about 1000+ points every monthand i spend about the same amount every month with this card on simplygo  mcdonalds and Spotify,btohqsg
i understand the SC smart card is getting nerfed but isn't it only in effect after April 2025?,btohqsg
Did you meet the $800 min spend?,btohqsg
no  but doesn't the minimum $800 spend bonus set in only after April ?,btohqsg
Then did you check if your bonus transactions are now clocked at 12.8 pts per $?,btohqsg
Can. Been using it tgt with heymax simplygo promo,btohqsg
Search the chat or the tnc  IIRC the additional/bonus point is delayed,btohqsg
oh? strange lol its been almost 2 months,btohqsg
nope they are not giving my bonus pointsI spend about $100+ every month  with that card and usually get 1.5k pointsbut for the past 2 statement months I've been getting about 100 pointsmy spending categories have not changed,btohqsg
Then correct. Will be credited by 30 Apr.,btohqsg
i see  thanks for the info,btohqsg
Can link heymax to other bank CC other than chocolate card to earn miles from simplygo?,btohqsg
UserEChas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no Lazada or shopee games,btohqsg
Hi all  is there any troubleshooting I can do as adding amaze to googlepay keep failed to S25 ultra1. Amaze card is not locked2. All transactions enabled,btohqsg
The hype abt chocolate card linking with heymax is just bcos chocolate card can pay for insurance and still get miles ?,btohqsg
AXS  Insurance and etc0% FX fee,btohqsg
Problem is with amaze not your phone,btohqsg
Hi everyone  Can i check if I GIRO payments for my insurance  will it be eligible for the new chocofinance x Heymax 2mpd/3.6%cashback?,btohqsg
How do you giro credit card? You mean recurring credit card payment.,btohqsg
sorry  i mean like set my grio payment to deduct from choco finance,btohqsg
You can use ur heymax linked choco fin card to pay your insurance premium instead,btohqsg
Hi everyone a question on credit card for airport lounge access  I have 2 companions that I would like bring them to lounge. I have 2 credit cards that offers 1+1 lounge access. Can I use these 2 cards together? What I research is a mix of response of Yes and No. Also  the tnc doesnt offer much info on this.,btohqsg
Based on T&C  no. Only 1 card per person.Reality  some managed to do it  some didn't.,btohqsg
If I link heymax to any CC  so many purchase via the Cc will earn me maxmiles?Or must be limited to online shopping displayed in the heymax app?Or can only earn miles using the chocolate card,btohqsg
It is just another shopback and can track mcc.,btohqsg

can earn max miles (and in some cases cc rewards) by1. click through heymax to spend using cc on some partner website/app (similar to shopback)2. public transport using linked visa during promo period3. buy vouchers on heymax4. get 2 max miles per $ using linked chocolate card5. referral and credit card sign up promo,btohqsg
Thanks for the elaboration.So means if I just go to the shop buy stuff and use paynwave can't earn miles  if I use other kind of CC üò¢,btohqsg
This is a much better offer.,btohqsg

Hello  this is probably a well-discussed topic but I'm trying to get some clarity.Is Poems a better platform than Endowus for SRS and CPF? Looking to buy into indices like MSCI World or US Prime. Sounds like Amundi is the choice fund. I used IWDA previously.- Endowus: 0.4% for SRS and CPF- Poems = 0%?,btohqsg
If I want to reset OCBC 360  where is the best place to park 100k for a month before putting back to OCBC 360?,btohqsg
can i earn 4mpd buying grab vouchers from Shopback through Apple Pay using my CRMC+Amaze combo?,btohqsg
Is it once I start the resetting of OCBC 360  I have to keeping on transferring money in and out forever?,btohqsg
Up to you. For my own ocbc 360  I reset once year at ard 103k balance by transferring HSBC ega for 1 month. Then start ocbc 360 at 96k the next month and increase 500ish a month again.,btohqsg
Does it work if I were to transfer 100K back n forth between ocbc 360 and HSBC every other month?,btohqsg
U do that way so that u only need to reset once a year isit?,btohqsg
Yes. You can do every month if you want to. Im lazy üòÜ,btohqsg
depends on the interest u getting on both accounts. See if interest is higher if just keep in ocbc for a few month and do 500 increment monthly,btohqsg
"Keyword is ""up to"" but the maximum interest rate you can get with 150k is 4%",btohqsg
will i get 4mpd by buying ecapitavoucher on the app using amaze + crmc,btohqsg
Better buy from wogi and redeem capita voucher.,btohqsg
Understand how u feel boon  but it's not a worthwhile investment. Even whole life plans  if u buy for the purpose of cashing out in the future  I rather u buy a term life and invest your money elsewhere. U put in REITs 20years still make more vs u pay for 20years. Don't forget what they show you are the illustrated performance  you can never 100% guarantee if it will under or over perform the projected earnings.,btohqsg
Anyone has their UOB Lunar New Year Pot of Gold Feb 2025 earmarked?,btohqsg
Not yet. There are still time. Id wait till 20ish.,btohqsg
I previously signed up for Citi premier miles for the sign up bonus. Just reached the required spending and don't intend to use it for my daily use. Will there be any min monthly charges to the card even if I don't use it at all?,btohqsg
"I noticed the airwrap is ""for her"" but I supposed male applicant also can choose airwrap? Any difference between applying through this link vs singsaver directly? Thank you!",btohqsg
may i ask how many times can we participate for this?,btohqsg
May I check  HSBC live+ need to have $600 transactions posted by calendar month?,btohqsg
You can participate once per eligible account per promotion period,btohqsg
Yes  only amount posted within the calendar month will be counted for that month,btohqsg
Can choose either.Click through the links supports this channel.Click through SingSaver is the same deal anyway,btohqsg
Did everyone on heymax receive this email? üôÉ,btohqsg
Yes. It is based on calendar month for 3 months  yearly quarters. ie Jan to Mar  Apr to Jun.I got confirmation from CSO that the bank counts spending. So if we get rebate in Nov  that month we spend min $600 is still fine. No need to spend min $600 + rebate.,btohqsg
Hello all. How long does it take usually for citibank to confirm a transaction from pending state? Asking because i hope it gets to my current statement month and not the next.,btohqsg
It depends on merchant  not citibank.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how auto conversion work in IBKR? Can I buy US stock if I have SGD cash? Can I receive SGD automatically from USD dividend? I assume only cash account not margin account.,btohqsg
Does that mean I have to manual convert to absorb $2 fee. Assuming my dividend only like $4?,btohqsg
Probably not worth doing that. Just wait for your next US stock purchase and it will use up your USD dividends,btohqsg
Question: can we get 4MPD if we used the DBS WWC for grab? Heymax seems to say that that‚Äôs possible,btohqsg
HeyMax additional 3 mmpd on SimplyGo will end tonight 2359HReference post:https://t.me/HMSGHive/22172 mmpd still applies for those using Chocolate VISA Debit Cardüç´ Chocolate Finance:https://hmsg.link/chocolateüí≥ HeyMax HMSG:https://hmsg.link/heymax,btohqsg
Where is a good place to spend cdc and sg60 vouchers in mall other than supermart ü§î,btohqsg
usually those big malls (e.g. Capitaland / Fraser malls) rarely accept CDC vouchers. but shops in heartland malls run by HDB do,btohqsg
cdc has a portion that can only be used at supermarket another portion for heartland stores,btohqsg
Mari Credit Card: How to Calculate Credit Card Foreign Currency Fees and Rates?Video:https://youtu.be/7IqW2O8vAOULast year  I reviewed the Mari Credit Card when it first launched. Now in 2025  it comes with some important updates! In this video  I‚Äôll break down the key benefits  address common misconceptions  and help you decide if this card is right for you.- Maribank code9QGO55OJhttps://hmsg.link/maribank,btohqsg
Sorry for the late reply. Thank you Ong for the feasible advise,btohqsg
Need some advice. Why can't I use the 1.8% yield for 30 days in Moomoo for CSOP USD money market fund or Fullerton SGD cash fund?,btohqsg
only for non cash plus funds,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  for big ticket appliances such as aircon and fridge  furnitures etc  which credit card would be better for interest-free instalments and also get cashback at the same time? I also see some cards must have minimum spend of$Xto be eligible for X% of cashback or mpd  would instalments qualify too?,btohqsg
Instalment usually won't earn rewards unless special promo,btohqsg
Finally got back my USDT from ftx.,btohqsg
Hey gurus  do ya‚Äôll have any reccs on what cc to use for travel bookings such as flight tiks  accoms from klook  agoda etc? Hoping to set the uob lady‚Äôs category as dining permanently since the switching of category is a little troublesome‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Then you need something like dbs woman world mastercard,btohqsg
Suggest u use Lady for travel related. If can have solitaire will be better.Use Amaze + CRMC for your non travel related expenses.,btohqsg
hi  then not so low risk to extract the rewards leh....which is easier to extract the value?  use trading coupons to buy sell stocks immediately  or use 1.8% for non cash plus funds?,btohqsg
How to know when chocolate finance debit card reset date??,btohqsg
"For personal income tax filing this year  if after claiming all reliefs one is entitled to; 2024 assessable income is 30k  means the $200 tax payable will be ""waived"" because of the personal income tax rebate of 60%  capped at $200  is this understanding correct ?",btohqsg
Check the DBS 3 months instalment promo. Valid till 28/2,btohqsg
Hi gurus  possible to advise if payment via Fairprice app using Maybank friends&family card has the 8% cashback been nerfed?cuz recently I noticed Singtel app has been nerfed,btohqsg
No. If after reliefs  your assessable income is $30k  your tax payable is $200. With the 60% rebate  your final tax payable is $80.,btohqsg
Does Assessable Income (AI) consists of CPF?,btohqsg
If I set up SRS account and put $15 300  do I need to inform Iras or they will auto detect my srs contribution and apply the tax relief for me ?,btohqsg
CPF contributions is calculated as part of relief.,btohqsg
wait sorry I don‚Äôt get it.. from what I heard & saw  CPF contributions made by the employer to the employee's CPF account are generally taxable when these are voluntary contributions. Compulsory CPF contributions on the other hand are generally not taxable.,btohqsg
Ohhh so to calculate my AI  just gross income minus compulsory cpf contributions?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows what will happen to the 90¬∫N miles if I decided to cancel the card?,btohqsg
Can check using the Maybank Treats app. Under benefit optimiser. For me  my recent purchases using FP app is still clocking the 8%.,btohqsg
can pay on singtel website  still get 8% under telco,btohqsg
seems like capitaland vouchers removed from wogi üò•,btohqsg
1. no2. because payment on Singtel app is not telco mcc,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I have tried on other funds. But it says threshold not reached,btohqsg
Share which funds  have your tried,btohqsg
Just do what is suitable for your risk level,btohqsg
HSBC GIF Ultra short duration bonds,btohqsg
That should work  mine is getting it. Or check with moomoo CS what is not working,btohqsg
Hi there  can I check if I use CRMC X Amaze for dental treatment (MCC: 8021) will be entitled Citi points?,btohqsg
Am I required to withdraw from my existing cash plus funds and subscribe to the new funds?,btohqsg
Yes different treatment for compulsory vs voluntary.,btohqsg
Cash plus funds do not work for 1.8%You need a new subscription which you may either deposit new funds  or redeem your existing cash positions.Please refer to the t&cs of how the coupon works again,btohqsg
If you are using FP app to pay for NTUC groceries  no issues always 8%. If you use FP app to pay Kopitiam foodcourt  then No,btohqsg
What I meant is employer giving extra (voluntary) contributions.Because both employer n employee can do separate independent voluntary contributions.,btohqsg
For qualifying spending on simplyGo  I just need to add my credit cards to the SimplyGo apps?,btohqsg
just tap the card (physical card or mobile wallet) for mrt/bus. Adding to Simplygo is optional  but good to have to check transactions and request refund (if applicable)Qualify for rewards/cashback or not depends on card TnC.,btohqsg
Correct. It would be gone. Do miles redemption. Wait for miles to be credited to KF. Pay the miles redemption fees and outstanding balance of the card. Lastly  call ocbc to initiate cancellation.,btohqsg
Bro I am bald already. No need to make funüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if I were to buy vouchers (e.g  Tada) via shopee. Will it consider as 5262 MCC code?,btohqsg
Hi  just to check for amex platinum card  the payment for insurance premiums should be excluded as well right?,btohqsg
Which is best card for banquet wedding,btohqsg
Hello  can we bring 1 guest for free T1 lounge using priority pass?,btohqsg
Depends what card you using and how many free passes. The guest can use the free pass too.,btohqsg
Is eligible for 8% cashback for FP app to pay at kopitiam when Dining category is selected,btohqsg
MCC 5814 is eligible for dining category,btohqsg
Ic  I have dining category too and I ever tried before but didn‚Äôt move the ticker. Thanks for this  I‚Äôll try again,btohqsg
when u tried? mcc5814 added back only 2-3 months ago,btohqsg
Anyone know if SingTel bill can set credit card recurring to Maybank fnf and still can get 8% cashback? One of my selected category was telco. Or need to manually pay via SingTel website every time?,btohqsg
Need to pay manually. Recurring was processed via axs i think. That wont earn rewards on maybank fnf,btohqsg
Ok noted. Thanks for your advise! üòä,btohqsg
For chocolate finance card  do we earn the miles by putting the card on file for recurring payment like monthly insurance premiums or income tax instalments? Or do we have to manually pay them thru axs,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
For this month  my SingTel recurring bill paid  using the Maybank card is still earning 8%. The amount has been recorded in the benefit optimiser under the data category.,btohqsg
üò±.. you been recurring all these while?,btohqsg
I had no idea about this SingTel app not having the correct MCC. So yes  since 2 months ago‚Ä¶ my SingTel bill is on recurring payment using Maybank card. Both months also receive 8% cash back,btohqsg
Oh so recent? I definitely tried about a year ago üòÖ,btohqsg
Alright thanks! I will try for one month to see if it captures. üòä,btohqsg
Recurring but not thru app right?,btohqsg
Also  anyone knows if topping up flashpay card w Maybank FnF gives 8%?,btohqsg
Still waiting approval . It‚Äôs been almost 2 weeks,btohqsg

When I booked from TPE to SIN via KF UOB portal (and using KF UOB CC) in Jan  I needed to pay the processing fee.The 3.25% FX fee (or the ~6% DCC markup by Scoot if pay using SGD) is charged on top of the total amount too.,btohqsg

Did you check if you can pay maribank and trust cc bills via giro?,btohqsg
If you meant thru the HSBC EGA account  there‚Äôs no option for MariBank and trust for CC bill payment. Does it mean both MariBank and trust are not eligible for grio payments?,btohqsg
Hi all  i just watched this youtube video  and i m abit confused.. For overseas spending  this Maribank CC has a Forex fee charge of 3%  after charging the 3% to us  we will gain 3% cashback on the remainder nett spending? So to put it in very simplicity context  excluding all the complicated math or english understanding  is it something roughly like  Maribank charge us a -3% and then after tat gives u +3%  which is as good as 0%?if thats the case  won't Trust Cashback card be the better option here?,btohqsg
I recall maribank and trust cc are not supporting giro payment yet,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thank you so much!,btohqsg

Morning  Will be traveling to Japan for vacation in JuneMay I know which CC provide best for miles - terms booking hotels & car rentalHotel stays - 9 nightsCar rental - 5 daysJapan dinning + shopping  etc..Thanks in advance,btohqsg
For japan  UOB VS. min spend 1k sgd eq to triggers 4mpd.,btohqsg
car rental i surely recommend UOB Visa SignatureHotels if you paying at the hotel itself it can be risky as the mcc can be anyhow one. If you are able to test while payment  can consider UOB Lady Travel categoryDining definitely Trust Cashback with Dining category chosen for me. Else HSBC Live+ for 8% cashback or Amaze + Maybank FnF DiningShopping can be Amaze + Maybank FnF Online Shopping  HSBC Live+. But watch the MCC to avoid disappointment.If you want ONE CARD FITS ALL  use UOB Visa Signature for least grief. If $2k not enough  get more than one principal card holder.,btohqsg
1 small tip. If you have iphone  you can add virtual suica card then top up with UOB VS  UOB PPV  HSBC revo and DBS wwmc. Then use suica to pay for many things in japan.,btohqsg

The current HSBC EGA bonus interest is 2.85% and base interest is 0.05%. if I transfer in $1000 every month to maintain the incremental  does it mean only the latest $1000 will earn the bonus interest and all the past saving will only earn 0.05%? Thank you.,btohqsg
Ain't a visa card I thought only Mastercard work with amaze,btohqsg
she meant using choco card directly to pay for hospital expenses,btohqsg
or the overseas expense at 'no fx fees',btohqsg
No! The additional 1k will only be entitled to the 1%,btohqsg
ok there is YES and NO discrepancy because HSBC EGA has many components of bonus interest.For OP question.. let's say he started with $50k and every month add $1kThe original $50k will not earn the bonus 2.x% interest beyond the first 2 months.The incremental $1k will earn the incremental bonus 1% interestThe big bonus 2.x% interest will cease once you are out of the Signup period and you are unlikely to earn any big bonus 2.x% interest unless you had emptied the account.,btohqsg

the moment FUNDS is mentioned  there is always a fee  whether by the Fund Manager or the platform provider  or BOTH,btohqsg
But is there any alternative to get a lower portfolio  platform fees,btohqsg
it depends on your relationship with the FI honestly..if mass market you are price taker  so you have to shop around to see which are the mass market platforms that can offer cheaply..if you do with banks  you can negotiate little to no platform fee for holding Funds. But their sales commission may be highyou want to be cheapo.. buy outside then transfer in.. but watch for transfer fees,btohqsg

i‚Äôve a question on the supercharging cpfthe supercharging only works if i reach bHS and not FRS. if my FRS is 213k i can‚Äôt do that. however will it work if my FRS is less than 213k because i invested it ? eg i have 213k but invested 3k. making it now 210k. will it work,btohqsg
Why supercharging don't work if you already reach FRS? FRS is calculated INCLUSIVE of invested capital in SA.,btohqsg
i see. tks. so if u try to RSTU to SA or transfer OA to SA it won‚Äôt work either just because your invested it ?,btohqsg
What he probably meant is he has not reached BHS but reached FRS.In this case regardless if SA is invested or not  the CPF contribution will still still be credit to MA SA & OA. since there is no max limit to SA because even if you reach FRS contributions will still flow in there.Hence no super charging.,btohqsg
I'm sure he meant the opposite.,btohqsg
Invested SA is included in the calculation of FRS. You cannot RSTU or transfer from OA to SA once you meet FRS.,btohqsg

Hi  trying to pay my insurance using choc finance card in AXS. I choose credit followed by other bank but system do not able to process. Anybody can help?,btohqsg
common issue for some ppl  I suppose choc finance is aware of the issue already  hope they can solve it,btohqsg
So I tested with 2 Choc Finance accounts. 1 account applied for physical card  1 account digital card only.The physical card account cannot pay via AXS  will always receive the P001 error message (System unable to process your payment request).The digital card account can make payments with no problems.,btohqsg
Don't think because of these. The card no is the same.Of course I done way earlier. Not sure any changes.,btohqsg
So is the choc finance card problem?,btohqsg
so far i tested a few merchants... the smoothest appears to be AXS pay iras... of course choose CREDIT CARD OTHER BANKS,btohqsg
wah touch wood.. that being said.. my physical card came yesterday and i ACTIVATED IT.. haven't tried to pay new payment..TOUCH WOOD!,btohqsg
I did that- choose credit card and other bank card but system said not able to proceed.,btohqsg
yes it appears not to be 100% reliable..reminds me of early Amaze card days.. those pioneer like me will remember..you paywave with Amaze  you can 50% expect the transaction to be declined..,btohqsg
Wonder if I go to the instute to make payment will have this issue.,btohqsg
Yup I called AXS they said it is a chocolate finance problem.Contacted chocolate finance  they said they are aware of the problem and not sure when it will be fixed. Their suggestion is to just keep trying,btohqsg
Not related I think  I have not received physical card yet  it‚Äôs been 3 weeks.The account that applied for physical card cannot pay on AXS.,btohqsg
i shouldn‚Äôt have applied for cf physical card ü•≤,btohqsg
so far based on what was posted it seems like so. even in the above ‚Äúnot related i think‚Äù post  user applied for the physical card but cannot pay by axs. that is exactly the issue.,btohqsg
i have humans:1. applied for physical not yet received physical  can successfully pay2. applied for physical  just received and activated physical  just successfully paid $10,btohqsg
If i have giro for iras  how do i cxl it? Must i cxl it before using cf card to pay?,btohqsg
just make sure you pay at least 10 working days before GIRO due date,btohqsg
I applied for physical card  not yet received. But still could make payment on axs,btohqsg
After physical card was received and activated.,btohqsg
If I pay via Apple Pay (S$1500) on Shopee using UOB VS  does this transaction earn miles?,btohqsg
only 0.4mpd  this is online not contactless,btohqsg

Same bill type  personal income tax and property tax,btohqsg
Same phone  same app. Tested on computer  same browser.,btohqsg
that could only mean it is not dependent on the device or whether you applied for physical/virtual only.Certain card numbers just will fail,btohqsg
Possible  to rule this out I can try applying for physical card on the digital CF account that works now.If it starts failing then it means applying for physical causes the problem,btohqsg
Meaning the one with physical card applied can't pay for both  while the other one with only virtual card can pay for both?,btohqsg
but but but... i also have multiple humans5th feb applied for chocolate  and immediately requested physical.5th Feb CAN PAY using virtual25th Feb  one human got the physical and activated it. 26th Feb  just paid $10 axs successfully,btohqsg
hence my hypothesis nothing to do with the virtual or physical card thingyis just blacklisted/defective card numbers,btohqsg
Yes  but it‚Äôs only 1 data point  so it could just be totally random as Mt mentioned,btohqsg
whether you kenna 'good' or 'bad' card number at least u know your fate.the WORST is you think you got a good one.. works at axs blah blah... you bring it overseas to use at paywave merchant... keeps declined,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm before I share the knowledge to my partner.Any purchase from website & app is a online transactionAny purchase you go to the  store you go there and tap your card is offline paymentAny purchase you go the store and tap using your phone is called NFCPlease correct me if I'm wrong in the explanations üòÅ,btohqsg

What is your view on this:Given the current economic climate marked by GST increases and persistent inflation driving up cost of living expenses  many individuals are exploring strategic investment opportunities to mitigate financial pressures and hedge against rising expenditures,btohqsg

Your observation is both timely and insightful. The combination of GST (Goods and Services Tax) increases  persistent inflation  and rising costs of living presents significant challenges for individuals aiming to maintain their purchasing power and financial stability. Exploring strategic investment opportunities is indeed a prudent approach to mitigating these financial pressures. Here's a detailed breakdown of the situation and possible strategies:The Current Economic ClimateGST Increases: Higher GST rates directly impact the cost of goods and services  reducing disposable income for many households. This creates a need for individuals to find ways to offset these additional expenses.Persistent Inflation: Inflation erodes the value of money over time  making it more expensive to purchase the same goods and services in the future.Rising Cost of Living: Housing  food  transportation  healthcare  and other essential expenses continue to climb  further straining household budgets.These factors collectively emphasize the importance of proactive financial planning.Why Strategic Investments Are KeyInvestments can serve as a hedge against inflation and rising costs by generating returns that outpace the erosion of purchasing power. However  not all investments are created equal  especially in an uncertain economic climate. Strategic investing involves identifying opportunities that align with your financial goals  risk tolerance  and time horizon.Potential Investment StrategiesHere are some approaches individuals can consider:1.¬†Inflation-Resistant AssetsReal Estate: Property values and rental income often rise with inflation  making real estate a popular hedge.Commodities: Gold  silver  and other commodities tend to retain value during periods of high inflation.Inflation-Linked Bonds: These bonds adjust their payouts based on inflation rates  preserving purchasing power.2.¬†Dividend-Paying StocksCompanies with strong fundamentals that pay consistent dividends can provide a steady income stream while offering potential for capital appreciation.3.¬†Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)ETFs that track indices or sectors like technology  healthcare  or energy can offer diversification and growth potential.4.¬†Investing in Skills or EducationEnhancing skills or pursuing certifications can lead to higher earning potential  indirectly offsetting rising costs.5.¬†Emergency Fund & LiquidityBefore diving into investments  ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3‚Äì6 months of expenses) to handle unexpected costs without liquidating investments prematurely.Key ConsiderationsRisk Management: Diversify your portfolio to spread risk across asset classes.Time Horizon: Align investments with your financial goals‚Äîshort-term needs may require more liquid assets  while long-term goals can accommodate higher-risk investments.Professional Advice: Consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your unique circumstances.Budgeting & Expense Control: Investments should complement efforts to manage spending and optimize savings.Final ThoughtsWhile rising GST rates and inflation pose challenges  they also present an opportunity for individuals to rethink their financial strategies and adopt a more proactive approach toward wealth building. By focusing on strategic investments that align with personal goals and economic trends  individuals can not only protect their finances but potentially thrive in the face of economic pressures.Would you like me to explore specific investment options or provide further guidance?,btohqsg

Sorry  I am new to HSBC EGA:- New-to-bank (no banking accounts/credit card)- Planning to open HSBC EGA (Premier) account and deposit $300 000 on 1st March 2025 (for the welcome promotion)Questions:1) With the Welcome promotions  I will get: Mar: HSBC EGA 2.85% + 1% (With 5 FAST transfer).Apr-Jun: 3% Welcome bonus for the entire account.Am I right?2) I am also entitled for one-time $300 cash rewards for holding $200 000 for 6 months. But the HSBC EGA interest rate will be 0.05% from July onwards  right?3) Does it mean I am getting negligible interest if I maintain the amount from July onwards? Can I terminate the Premier relationship after Jun to avoid fall below fee of $50?Thanks.,btohqsg
Current ongoing HSBC EGA Bonus Interest promos don't apply to new accounts opened in 2025 (not sure if Mar same  can check again when it's released).,btohqsg
And also see lock in tnc.,btohqsg
TLDR: I recall I read before. Premier banking signup not worth it if u doing only cash.,btohqsg
"Exactly  this is what I am confused with.I will not be eligible for the Feb Bonus promotion  but this ""Apply Now"" button seems to me that new account doesn't require registration.",btohqsg
Yeah recently got a stupid new tnc. To get the fat 2.x% bonus account must be opened before 1st January 2025,btohqsg
Apply now just means apply now  nothing more. T&c is what matters.,btohqsg
Ya  I have spent hours reading the TnC. But I am still confused.The lock in period is like 3 months to get the cash rewards of $688,btohqsg
Are u sure priority banking lock in is 3 months?Last I checked (a while ago) it is 6 months. Maybe now changed.,btohqsg
There could be 2 lock-in3 months is for the cash gift6 month is to avoid early account closure feeSneaky,btohqsg
Ops  sorry  I mean the Welcome bonus.I wasn't aware of Premier lock in. Let me check,btohqsg
Apparently HSBC Everyday+ Rewards also have new t&c. I haven't got to compare both old and new. Effective from 31 Mar.,btohqsg
Huh published so early? Let me go see see,btohqsg
I‚Äôm using my phone. Just scanned quickly. Can‚Äôt tell the difference. lol. Old eyes. Sorry,btohqsg
Does it mean HSBC EGA interest is only 0.05% and doesn't make sense to hold until 6 months?,btohqsg
Next time standard answer is ‚ÄúI manage to pay chocolate using CC but not the other way round. I did it at Fairprice‚Äù. ü§≠,btohqsg
Oh  just came to my mind. If it makes sense for the first 4 months:Mar: HSBC EGA 2.85% + 1% (With 5 FAST transfer).Apr-Jun: 3% Welcome bonus for the entire account.Maybe I can transfer the fund to FD with 2.7% for 5th month onwards.,btohqsg
If u earn 2.7% on cash u are vomiting out the earlier benefits already.,btohqsg
With additional $688 cash rewards  might still worth it.It's a bit complicated.Most importantly I can't even confirm the E.I.R for first four months yet,btohqsg
HSBC EGA if u play rotation can earn you 3.x% pa each month already without any lock in or new to bank nonsense.,btohqsg
1%pa on $300k is already $250 difference. Why bother with sign up bonus,btohqsg
Right. But seems like not much options for rotation now.CIMB FastSaver and Maybank deposit promotion below 2.9%. SCB eSaver 2.9%. I thought it would be good to leave it for a few months.,btohqsg
HSBC EGA not the best account to keep few months unfortunately. In fact it's the most shortest term kind (1 month in and out),btohqsg
Rotate with Uob one then but only $150k,btohqsg
It's like too complicated. I thought 3% welcome interest for 3 months could be a good options,btohqsg
3.05% EIR I think have better places to put elsewhere üòÖ,btohqsg
To be fair that‚Äôs how banks offer it. Convenient solution won‚Äôt be the best.U want the best deal u got to work for it. And do things not everyone can do.,btohqsg
UOB One is what I am considering but I have issue with credit card minimum spending  inconsistent.Currently I have UOB Stash account which I rotate for the quarterly promotions. And also OCBC 360 with credit card paying tax via CardUp.I used to rotate with CIMB FastSaver  SCB eSavers and Tbills.,btohqsg
Right.But I already have OCBC360 and UOB Stash (With quarterly promo).Seems like interest rate decreasing and not much options.I also subscribed for SSB this month to lock the interest close to 3% but only allocated partially.,btohqsg
Hi  want to check  does paying for education using UOB Debit card counts towards the UOB One $500 spend?,btohqsg
Yea I only parked for this month since Feb has least days.But I also test parking some at Fullerton Short Term Interest Bond 30 days ago  gotten slightly above 5.1% / annum.On the other hand  HSBC Ultra Short Duration Bond earned me 4.1% / annum for the same period 27 Jan - 26 Feb.,btohqsg
If my assumption is correct:Mar: 300 000 x 3.85% = 962.50Apr: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750May: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750Jun: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750Welcome Cash Rewards = 688Total interest (4months) = 3900.50E.I.R. = 3.9%,btohqsg
What's the best way to pay insurance?,btohqsg
To enjoy the uob savings promo  which day should i wipe out my stash account? And which day should i deposit the funds back?,btohqsg
UOB one account cc spend is actually easy to hit. UOB one credit card can use to pay SP utility. It's a decent chunk of 500$ spend. Pay insurance also counts for bonus interest min spend.,btohqsg
1st of march. And deposit in apr  ideally April 1.,btohqsg
U need to consider u are forced to keep $200k in month 5 n 6 too.,btohqsg
Thank you. Interest is credited on 1 march if im not wrong. So will withdraw after interest right? I only register for the promotion after i withdraw right?,btohqsg
Yes. Empty everything. The deposit back and register for q2 promo in April.,btohqsg
The current promo will end on 29 March. Does it mean im not in time for it?,btohqsg
The current promo looks at Dec MAB so you are already very late to the party,btohqsg
Ohh. The Q2 promo is not out yet right? So to withdraw on 1 march means i cant see how attractive the promo first then decide whether to withdraw and participate right?,btohqsg
"It's the ""risk"" you need to take. If UOB follows same pattern  q2 promo will use march MAB. You wait til promo is out  it's too late to clear ur UOB acct already.And rmb the promo is on top of UOB normal rate so you will get decent amount of interests regardless.",btohqsg

Hello  I‚Äôm paying for Reno. Not sure which cash back credit card should I be using for Ipaymy.,btohqsg
User~wrhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no random link,btohqsg
If based on t&cs:Mar: 1.05% p.a. = $267.53Apr: 3.05% p.a. = $752.05May: 3.05% p.a = $777.12Jun: 3.05% p.a = $752.05Welcome rewards = $688Total interests (4 months) = $3236.75EIR = 3.24% p.a.,btohqsg
Then new version for what. Lame HSBC,btohqsg
They restructure the t&c.. but wording same..Maybe got new guy take over the previous guy job... So now more onz.,btohqsg
I'm still in the same boat üò¢ digital card with physical card applied but hasn't arrived. Can't pay on AXS despite trying every other day since the launch... Chose credit card (other banks)  sufficient funds in account,btohqsg
Gd morning  what charges are immediate posted to credit card ? I still has a gap to meet min spend,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your help!Then probably I should only deposit to EGA on 31 Mar.I might deposit to SCB eSavers first for 2.9%.Btw  does HSBC practises the 10:30pm+ / Sunday / public holiday cut-off timing for like OCBC/UOB/SCB?30 Mar is Sunday and 31 Mar is public holiday.,btohqsg
think should deposit on 29 Mar morning,btohqsg
Depends on which bank your card is from. Then find a shop where the terminal is also by the same bank. High chance but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Thanks!You are right. I am considering whether it makes sense to pay the $50 fall below fee instead.Btw  is HSBC EGA for Personal and Premier Banking the same? If I terminated the Premier relationship  do I still hold the same EGA account?,btohqsg
I see. Even though the TnC stated the last day for funding is 31 Mar,btohqsg
Hi all  for IRAS tax payments  I understand we can only set up a GIRO with bank accounts.So to use cardup / chocolate finance to pay for it  do we just set the payment to be minimum 2 weeks before the actual GIRO deduction date?Meaning there won't be double deductions in one single month  right?Thanks!,btohqsg

Anyone with experience using the chocolate finance debit card? It was working when I linked it to HeyMax and it deducted 0.01. But when I tried to use it at my church website  it was declined. Anyone have issues with card with certain merchants?,btohqsg
some card numbers have issue. choco finance aware of this issue,btohqsg
Would you know does this mean my card cannot be used for anything at all or only at certain merchants?,btohqsg
Well I called Chocolate finance and they told me that their Visa debit card does not allow transactions  from social service agencies and churches ie anything under donations. I keep hearing we earn max miles points for Charities etc. so now I am confused,btohqsg
Hi guys random question usually UOB one account promo will come out every starting of the quarter right? If i want to be eligible for next quarter i.e. Q2  do i put the money elsewhere for at least 1 month first? Then put it back when the quarter starts to eligible for freshfund?,btohqsg
I think they bluff on this. Some dp on heymax chat for churches and I used mine for donation myself.,btohqsg
Yes. Withdraw money on mar 1 for q2 promo for example.,btohqsg
Looks like it‚Äôs trial and error.. will try other places.,btohqsg
Understood  thank you  any indication if the Q2 bonus will be better or worse‚Ä¶? Or should i just load it for the current lunar new year pot?,btohqsg
Was your Dec MAB low/zero? If not  you already missed q1 condition.,btohqsg
Yea i have 2 accounts to alternate  another account never use before  so i can either put in the funds now in new account  lock for 5 months  or wait for Q2 promo‚Ä¶,btohqsg
In this env  I doubt interest rate will go up.,btohqsg
I will like to purchase PIMCO income fund. What is the lowest cost platform or broker to use? Any recommendations?,btohqsg
Mari Invest Income is offering it. Under maribank app.,btohqsg
What will be the rate like? I saw this in Tiger as well. But not sure of the cost,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt doubt trump / musk power,btohqsg
