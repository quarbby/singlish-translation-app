My argument is its more of a lack of connection between regulars and nsfs in comparison to it being a race thingThen I raised the counter example of how Chinese nsfs do not get offs for Hari Raya eve or deepavali eve and stuff like that when they are all already promised a half day off. Apparently those situations aren't racist even though they operate on the same principle of majoritarianism,btohqsg
This is so stupid tho  the half off is non transferable anyway,btohqsg
They can justify why Chinese people should not get a half day off the day before minority holidays on the principle of pragmatismBut they use racism to justify why non Chinese people (when in actuality everyone is affected) when people are forced to take leave on a majority holiday eve,btohqsg
"""ill reformulate my opinions when i get the full picture""""but it definitely doesnt seem very fair right now regardless of whether the lack of equitability is of the race flavour  the majoritarian flavour or something else""",btohqsg
Should revoke the scholarship at this point,btohqsg
lj liddat just give off la,btohqsg
this one not fucking BMT hv to use off one,btohqsg
Scdf pes E lol best NS life I could possibly ask for,btohqsg
Basic training just 5 days and all stay out,btohqsg
Idk why they can't just give a full day off,btohqsg
Need to turn it into some problematic ass shit like this,btohqsg
The thing is I can understand why people think it is racially motivated,btohqsg
But I feel that there is insufficient data to prove that it is racially motivated,btohqsg
Their only evidence is its on the eve of cny,btohqsg
Dw its some rich Indian kid from india whose dad makes like 10K/month,btohqsg
Damn  he shouldâ€™ve given the chance to someone else then,btohqsg
This is what happens when paper qualifications triumph everything,btohqsg
I think an A for GP should unironically be a requirement for PSC scholars,btohqsg
Tbf that's cause meritocracy is kinda fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
And the purpose of scholarship is to award merit not necessarily to help people who are poor :/,btohqsg
So like idt there's anything wrong with them getting the scholarship,btohqsg
Just that their argument against me isn't the most logical?,btohqsg
And they don't really attack the crux of my perspective :/,btohqsg
idts  more like commanders dw them at camp on fri cuz they also off on that day  without thinking abt the consequences of making them do so,btohqsg
Lol I didn't get PSC cuz they said they couldn't hear me,btohqsg
They called me back to explain to me why I didn't get the scholarship,btohqsg
Then told me to reapply this yr,btohqsg
(I lost my voice 2 days before),btohqsg
Definitely should try again then. I think a person of your calibre is worthy of it,btohqsg
Donâ€™t want to be bonded Ah,btohqsg
They give me such a shitty reason to not give me a scholarship why should i waste my time on them,btohqsg
At the end of the day it's their loss not mine,btohqsg
And its not like I can't just reapply somewhere else :/,btohqsg
90Rp I alr have nus merit anyways,btohqsg
