Hi friendsI have a friend who is very opiniated about world politics  especially in the USA and the western world. He is conservative (ie will vote generally vote Republican).While I am happy to listen to him express his views  I do not have sufficient knowledge about these matters for me to engage him. He has asked me if I have any right wing leaning friends  which I have none (since I would guess most Singaporeans are too focused on their own individual lives to even have a strong opinion on matters with limited impact to them). I have offered to post in sg forums to look for like minded palsSo if anyone here has any of the following traits and is interested in making a new friend  please drop me a dm and I'll introduce you to him1. You consider yourself right wing in most aspects2. You are not fond of Joe Biden3. You have considerable interest and knowledge in world politics4. You enjoy listening to people go on an occasional rant,btohqsg
Is really not me la hahahahha i can't be bothered,btohqsg
