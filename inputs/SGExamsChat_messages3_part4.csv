More mods yes and you have a final year project to do,btohqsg
Which will probably involve working on a problem with a professor,btohqsg
You can also before your final year,btohqsg
Anyway honors generally involves either doing a Thesis  or a Final Year Project  or some extra classes.Because of that  some employers will think you more zai or will value you more. So may get more pay  particularly for companies with established  rigid HR like gov sector.,btohqsg
Wow that person takes H3 Chem too???,btohqsg
There’s this programme called UROPS in NUS which allows you to work with a professor on an open problem,btohqsg
Ikrrrrr no wonder my dad always boast about that person,btohqsg
Or research/study the field your prof specialises in,btohqsg
Sorry lah your useless snailbrain daughter is not as capable of scoring the grades u want,btohqsg
By chance  do u know where to get notes for certain subjects?,btohqsg
Like text me asap if u got lobang,btohqsg
And most profs are quite open about it,btohqsg
Depending on what you're doing  there can be better ways to spend your time. I skipped out on honors to build portfolio externally on my own. Managed to be paid more than honors grads.,btohqsg
They will take you in even if you have no idea what their speciality is,btohqsg
what’s the average rp of students in nus law?,btohqsg
How does it compare with masters,btohqsg
Wah masters is a whole other ballgame. Honestly don't bother until you've worked for a couple of years  or else your knowledge is mostly gonna be airy fairy and ungrounded. Hard to hire.,btohqsg
Never say but if im to extrapolate probably 87.5 to 88.75,btohqsg
Anyway if ur rp is above 85-86  it doesnt mean anything for law admissions already,btohqsg
anyone has BMAT and UKCAT resources to recommend :D,btohqsg
Design  app development that kind of stuff,btohqsg
Obviously a Masters in 'app dev' doesn't mean anything,btohqsg
Or more generically 'SWE' of some kind,btohqsg
Masters in AI/ML might mean more  but either way non-brain-dead recruiters would want to look for githubs/repos rather than pure mathematics  and a PhD is more reliable in terms of just pure mathematics anyway,btohqsg
It'll be called masters in human computer interaction loh if I pursued. But not worth without more work.,btohqsg
Lol definitely does not sound worth it,btohqsg
Masters in more technical areas are generally more worth it,btohqsg
Got some prospects la  but unless you have about 5 years or work under your belt  no point.,btohqsg
Masters may make sense if wanna go deep into academics  but might as well go for PhD after your degree instead of stopping for masters,btohqsg
PhD worth when you want the whole school population to only address you as dr@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
laughs in course where fyp can be replaced with internship,btohqsg
I disagree - and people aren't looking for 'answers' when they pick a uni course,btohqsg
How can we not be miserable,btohqsg
Same hereIdk if bio/chem or comp sci,btohqsg
I scared i go chem wasted nvr try cs,btohqsg
How much knowledge of the other sciences does Chem Olympiad at JC level require?,btohqsg
Just like Bio olympiadLiterally uni bio,btohqsg
Learn stuff like how for humans the anus formed first before the mouth etc,btohqsg
Do you know what’s in Chem O syllabus though,btohqsg
The question might be about what different courses are like  which has no right answer. But the deeper question is more about what direction in life....which has a unique personal answer...but NVM. Online not best place for so complex ponderings.,btohqsg
That's the pessimistic view la. It doesn't have to be like that. Why dig your own grave?,btohqsg
maybe its just my millenial tendencies,btohqsg
I thought the fm video was more optimistic,btohqsg
i will yeet you into the shadow realm,btohqsg
Says the one going into NS,btohqsg
hi is anyone here from yale-nus law+liberal arts double degree programme,btohqsg
how difficult is it to get into NTU REP? i heard its v selective haha,btohqsg
Supposedly equally competitive  or worse than med,btohqsg
It's really the only thing I can say,btohqsg
only like 50-60 a year I think,btohqsg
