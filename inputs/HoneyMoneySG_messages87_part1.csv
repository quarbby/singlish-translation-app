As long as you start spending in one category  you need to meet min 1k spend.,btohqsg
Must $1000 in local or overseaCannot mix together,btohqsg
May j in know what is cash advance?,btohqsg
hello everyone i am new here. Just want to ask for those who buy shares using moomoo or webull ? Or both ?,btohqsg
Or using any bank securities ? Like HSBC or UOB,btohqsg
Which is good for long term holding shares,btohqsg
depends on which country? SG/HK/US/?For SG / SGX  if you only buy in smaller amounts  may be cost effective to use custodian broker (they own your shares on your behalf) like moomoo/webull/tiger  then maybe once a year transfer out to CDP.For CDP  cheapest fees is use DBS Vickers cash upfront mode to BUY and FSMone to SELL (DBS Vickers and FSMOne is linked shares stored in CDP)Other countries one I dunno,btohqsg
Is it better to have both moomoo and webull app for buying shares?,btohqsg
For me so far still not yet. Already spend close to 800 for this coming statement. Still at 800plus. Once it jump will update here.,btohqsg
Depending on when your transactions are posted.,btohqsg
My statement just begin on 19th. So it will be affected with the ‚Äúblip‚Äù. So yea. Once its in  will update,btohqsg
From what I know  there are 2 types of trust cards. Mainly credit card & debit card. Different reward system for both cards. Need to know which card u holding & if u are a Fairprice member in order to know which reward system u are in,btohqsg
Depends on where u spend  if u not spending at Fairprice Group. It's 0.22% cashback in Linkpoints not cash,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for the detailed explanation,btohqsg
But if mainly using for over seas spend then  it‚Äôs just 0.22% I guess?,btohqsg
Yup! Tried using in JB  rate not bad & can withdraw cash (Subjected to their bank if they want to charge for withdrawal),btohqsg
hi can anyone help to clear my mind for this - cpf SA 4% interests yearly  is it worth to place funds in fixed deposit for 3.8% in just 3 months ?,btohqsg
3 months i get 3.8% compare to 1 year in SA,btohqsg
What FD gives 3.8% returns in 3 months ?,btohqsg
Please tell me where to find 15.2% p.a. I also want to invest,btohqsg
ummm that is not how compound interest works,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs 3.8% p.a for 3 months period,btohqsg
I only see this for FDs also ü§™ I need to know where's the 15.2% p.a. FD from. üåö,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong 3.8% vs 4% u alr lose out isnt it?,btohqsg
I think he thought will get 3.8% returns in 3 months vs 4% a year,btohqsg
But pls do share if really can get 3.8% returns for 3 months.,btohqsg
SA go in cannot come out,btohqsg
FD still can touch if you really need  so have to see what's your end goal,btohqsg
Oh i think you are right  3.8% p.a for 3 months.....may i know what this means ?,btohqsg
Annum is 1 year which is 12 months. So basically you only get 1/4 of 3.8%.,btohqsg
3.8% * 3/12 is what you'll get,btohqsg
I just posted about 6.8% p.a. for 31 days this afternoon only (Pinned message),btohqsg
May i know how is this calculated? Let say i put in bank $5000 ?,btohqsg
Your interest will be 5000 √ó 3.8% √ó 3 √∑ 4,btohqsg
Hi  Can I check for Citi+Amaze  I need to use the Amaze card to pay for my local and overseas transactions. I will earn 10x mile points?,btohqsg
Oh now i get what you mean.....then is really dont touch SA better,btohqsg
yeap SA is now giving 4.08% so its even btr,btohqsg
Can that be used for OA funds ? Maybe can consider for OA,btohqsg
Never ever touch SA unless you have guaranteed 4.1% to invest in..,btohqsg
Yes. Amaze converts spending to online local spend. Citi Rewards gets 4mpd (10x thank you points) for eligible online spend.  Travel- related MCCs and mobile wallet excluded.,btohqsg
Oh i see......thanks for clearing my mind........wow my calculatuons sucks hahaha,btohqsg
Yes if you have short runway  put in 3.8% FD is good for OA which is only 2.5%.,btohqsg
You bought your Rolex from AD  or from grey market shops from Far East those ?,btohqsg
Arh ok. Couldn't get from AD  so thought of using Manhattan card up to $6667 from grey market  but duno if their merchant code will qualify for the Cashback or not. If no Cashback  then will lose $ coz they charge 2.5% for using credit card.Also  I just found out that StanChart no longer offer Manhattan card. Saw from their website. So also not sure if the high 3% Cashback still valid or not for existing card holder. If anyone used it recently  so share and confirm. Thanks,btohqsg
yes... loyal SCB Manhattan card holders continue to enjoy  and will get card renewed  3% cashback min spend $3k  max spend $6.67k.,btohqsg
Need to do options already.easily 10% per month (rolling wheel  selling cover put and calls) but have higher riskOtherwise can do sideway strategies like butterflies and condors,btohqsg
i think investments are not comparable to cash alternatives.Many people do both.Investments using money they can loseCash alternatives for their emergency funds,btohqsg
Knowing which MCC code which merchant belongs too is really a headacheIs there any site with a consolidated merchant code?,btohqsg
heymax doesnt have a lot of MCCs  best is to use DBS DigiBot or Amaze,btohqsg
Can share which mcc is not in heymax?,btohqsg
