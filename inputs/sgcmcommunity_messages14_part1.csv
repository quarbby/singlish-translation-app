Mazda is underrated in this region. I agree for the same amount of money  Mazda gives better interior built quality and styling though the later is subjective,btohqsg
I don't disagree. If compare to other 2L NA similar segment  it isn't,btohqsg
More then enough for daily commute car la,btohqsg
Skyactiv need to tune for driveability  from factory it is slow in the low and mid end,btohqsg
Hello does anyone know the procedure for buying onsgcarmart.comim in Zimbabwe africa,btohqsg
where the admin hahaha this one sus,btohqsg
Will delete  ban and report if it becomes something,btohqsg
you mean you can do better than mazda factory? how?,btohqsg
"you buy a car to tune to get more ""power""?",btohqsg
please dont believe in this kind of crap,btohqsg
if you buy a high performance machine like a m3 m5 911 gt3 etc then you can do this meaningfully,btohqsg
Factory tune for all fuel... You tune for 98 then come and tell us whether mazda left any power on the table?,btohqsg
what power do you want? how much power do you think you can get from a modest skyactiv 2.0?,btohqsg
some cars can have significantly better drive even with a tune,btohqsg
uh  manufacturers tend to de tune their cars to pass emissions  have better fuel economy  etc.,btohqsg
No one tunes for power here...bhp is useless. People tune for torque  to overtake hoggers with tight gaps,btohqsg
other peoples car let them tune  luh  don‚Äôt affect you also right? no need find problem with other peoples decision cos you mazda purist,btohqsg
so in reality one can do a basic tune and get some more power  or tune the gearbox to their liking as well. Very common with ZF gearboxes if you've heard of them,btohqsg
torque can help improve daily driving more then u think even,btohqsg
i am not a mazda purist.,btohqsg
i want to know what engine you have tuned meaningfully,btohqsg
torque helps you when you have 5 grown men sitting in a 1.5L diesel hatchback,btohqsg
Actually pls don't go tune a stock ride then say no power. Need to have hardware changed like intake  exos  or even more like fast road cams,btohqsg
power is the thing helping you accelerate faster,btohqsg
thank you for the education  but we know what torque and power is,btohqsg
shush not everyone is as knowledgeable as you boomer,btohqsg
so if you know how good the increase of torque is in certain applications  why so frustrated?,btohqsg
you ahev been giving wrong info anyway,btohqsg
is people tune want their own car leh not ur car also,btohqsg
Only can buy mazdas for foreigners,btohqsg
i am not frustrated. i am just asking what meaningful increase do you get from a 2 liter mazda 3 engine,btohqsg
Actually what helps you accelerate faster is torque haha.. power which is bhp is the total torque X rpm  which is why bhp is usually at certain rpms,btohqsg
tuned a volvo for better driveability  got better fuel consumption!,btohqsg
If you feel you cannot pump 98 minimum then don't. Stick to the low Ron map of your ecu,btohqsg
Buy an ev save the trouble,btohqsg
Yes tuned my Mazda last time even 1.5 SkyG better FC and power. Changed some hardware of course  not for power but much more driveable after that,btohqsg
how much did you spend on this,btohqsg
honestly a lot of singaporeans don‚Äôt just tune for power. but also better drivability,btohqsg
But that was the past  now driving TC  can tune even more esp with boost lol,btohqsg
torque is important but rpm is also ma  that's why tuning optimizes the air fuel ratio at certain RPM to maximise power,btohqsg
but  for goods haulage power is not important,btohqsg
Well yes but a factory stock Mazda engine only has power at 4k onwards haha... Not sustainable,btohqsg
anyway just tune for pops and bangs and annoy boomers la. no need power. accelerate so fast also can't beat red light,btohqsg
So we lower the band to 2k  high end suffers but who drives a 1.5 Sky for high end anyway,btohqsg
thats why tune for torque low down  btr fc!,btohqsg
summon all the getgo drivers ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
Ya la.. with the PHV driving same model  changed at the next opportunity haha,btohqsg
mazda is made for low revv driving. 2400 rpm at 120 kmh. to get more power got to drive it hard near redline.,btohqsg
2.4k at 120 is not low btw,btohqsg
