Citi rewards with amaze on ntuc and retail Shopping vs HSBC Revo which better,btohqsg
If Citi removed the amazed perk I bet Citi rewards is considered a nerf like I hear dbs Woman card,btohqsg
If Citi nerf amaze I'm switching to HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Then HSBC Revo is a better card after Citi nerf amaze,btohqsg
Look at DBs Woman card got nerf is a bad impeding doom,btohqsg
CRMC + amaze is such a good combo. 10X points with low FX spread. If it kenna nerf HSBC Revo would be next best choice but can't link to amaze,btohqsg
might get another MC card like ICBC Zodiac or SC Unlimited,btohqsg
