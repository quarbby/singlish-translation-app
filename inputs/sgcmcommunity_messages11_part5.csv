How to keep your car clean with the least amount of effortDo you prefer to DIY and wash your own car or go to a car wash?👉🏻 React with 🥰 if you prefer to wash your own car!👉🏻 React with 😁 if you prefer to go to a car wash!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
that is what skills come into play. you do this often you become better. i have never had problems. tires dont touch curbs. all good. occasionally a b it too far.,btohqsg
be careful  cars with rfid readers have become targets of thefts,btohqsg
i saw one KL guy he always hides his rfid reader when he parks his car,btohqsg
no point  once you tear off it become invalid.,btohqsg
once you tear it off  it will damage the signal line of the printing thus rendering that rfid as damaged and invalid,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admininside the article got typo 😂😂pardon me,btohqsg
9c rm difference to some people is rather not lol? I just realised. But rfid really smooth but last time woodlands side $20 can use rfid but the 2nd tap cannot use sometimes,btohqsg
don’t understand your message.rfid don’t need to tap. its uses radio frequency to detect the passive atenna sticker on your car. there is no tapping action needed.,btohqsg
I am using rfid i know in simple rfid last time dont detect 2nd small fee payment only for vep $20,btohqsg
if you are talking about road charge. it is alway using tng card  never rfid.,btohqsg
vep collection via the rfid sticker has never been implemented even thou you installed. road charge is always collected via tng card. period.,btohqsg
I paid with rfid back then,btohqsg
interesting. cause i have never seen the collection system install at kastam to collect vep via rfid at the kastam.,btohqsg
Ewallet loaded can use if u fitted,btohqsg
For tuas is smooth can use rfid for both,btohqsg

Is this faster than fk8R? Same specs sort of,btohqsg
And poison each other at the same time,btohqsg
European horses are stronger than the Japs…. But less reliable,btohqsg
This is subject to individual point of view. For European made  as long as willing spend $$$$$ to perform preventive maintenance  they are as reliable as japs,btohqsg
Car Review - Maserati Levante GT 2.0 (A)Itnow has a 2.0-litre mild hybrid engine that produces 326bhp and 450Nm of torque  slightly lesser than the V6 variant (both still have the same 0-100km/h timing).👉🏻 React with 😁 if you prefer the new 2.0-litre mild-hybrid Maserati Levante!👉🏻 React with 😢 if you prefer the earlier 3.0-litre V6 powered Maserati Levante!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
if you are spending lots of money to do preventive maintenance  then they are quite simply not reliable.,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminis this allowed? Maybe u should set house rules and pin the message,btohqsg
It is not allowed  and yes  there is a pinned message stating that no form of advertisements/promotions is permitted in this group.,btohqsg

Well folks who have the financial ability and luxury of time to maintain their continental cars  it’s good for our workshops and accessories merchants to sustain their business. Overall  good for Singapore consumer index lah. Perhaps they might own additional pairs of wheels as well. After all  Singapore is a rich man’s playground. Thanks to their contribution.,btohqsg
A lot go Malaysia repair car liao,btohqsg
For me I do it out of my love of driving bmw for pleasure. But I must say it sucks in the reliability and maintenance. Ownership cost is high. You got to spend more time and money on it to make it in top running condition.,btohqsg
Quite standard nowadays   earn sgd go Malaysia spent and do repair,btohqsg
However I’ve found pleasure in driving Mazda. It’s a “complete” car for me. Reliable  low running costs  low fuel consumption. And enjoyable too.,btohqsg
Mazda 6 2.5. Luxury sporty feel. Economical and firm suspension I like,btohqsg
Fuel consumption of 13 km a liter average,btohqsg
CX is damn popular. It’s not taking Malaysians by storm. Many realize what a great car,btohqsg
Formerly people choose Toyota Honda. Today more Mazda now,btohqsg
Mazda definitely more fun than Toyota nowadays imo,btohqsg
I know a malaysian girl who loves Mazda so much her next purchase is also a Mazda. From 3 to cx30,btohqsg
For sure. They follow European traditions. Automatic trans. And driving pleasure,btohqsg

Now i only touch the bmw once a week to heat up engine,btohqsg
I can help you drive 😂,btohqsg
Cx 30 2.0 is a good choice,btohqsg
Mazda 3 has a capable chasis but unfortunately is underpowered with the 1.5,btohqsg
