Hi@ChrisHMSGor other gurus  I saw that UOB EVOL was recommended as an alternative to using Revolut for overseas spend. It was calculated that FX Fee + Spread = 4%. Have a few follow up questions:1. May I confirm how it is calculated because I can‚Äôt find any info for the Spread Quantity  only saw from T&C the FX is 3.25%https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/gen_info_cards.pdf2. What‚Äôs the payment method for this 4%? Is it still the Contactless PayWave at overseas outlet through Google Pay or is it using some other mechanism?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA Account work out to b 2.18% not 4.45% cause only 6 months then can withdraw but interest is based on 4 months. Pls correct me if I am wrong.,btohqsg

Just curious  have you all received your free stocks for webull? I funded my account but nothing.,btohqsg

3.25% is the fee from visa as well as bank.Then visa rates are about 0.8% markup from interbank rates.,btohqsg
It still make sense if you hardly spent$600 locally,btohqsg
If this is the SMS u received then you have registered for the bonus interest in Apr. But if you have registered in Jan to Mar previously  the Apr registration is invalid as u are already under a bonus interest window.,btohqsg
4 months withdraw  no fund in there still can hv the interest after 2 months?,btohqsg
Are you referring to the 3 free shares from funding account or 2 free shares after 30 days of holding?,btohqsg
For example  if previously registered for bonus interest in Feb for Feb to May cycle  can withdraw everything on 1 Jun ($0 balance in Jun)  register for new bonus interest cycle in Jul,btohqsg
You need to manually claim the rewards in your app. After claiming  the rewards would go into 'transit' before 'completed'. The rewards is your free fractional shares.,btohqsg
Got it! Thank you v much for explaining üôè,btohqsg
