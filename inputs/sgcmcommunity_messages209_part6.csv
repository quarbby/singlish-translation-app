looks tbh most impt since u gonna spend so much already ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hello first time car buyer here  looking at getting a suv car with 3 coe years budget $30k below . Any suggestions nv??,btohqsg
Maybe looking at suv like Toyota rush,btohqsg
I mean the price of the car $30k with 2-3 year coe,btohqsg
30k still got plenty of options,btohqsg
I think ur first car u shld go with a jdm. Like a toyota. Any other car u get later is a upgrade,btohqsg
A3 is also 30k. Vezel also 30k. Even harrier also 30k,btohqsg
Show what? Cant u go sgcm and put in filter?,btohqsg
Bal 2yrs n below SUV are at 25-30,btohqsg
Bal 3yrs n abv r going for 30+k,btohqsg
U take 12-14k depre a year go count,btohqsg
Ya hes asking for bal 2-3 yrs isnt it?,btohqsg
Ya got a lot. But just not sure which model is the better option for suv,btohqsg
30k 3yrs... Thts abt 10k depre,btohqsg
Personal preference  I wldnt touch any cars thts 7yrs n older,btohqsg
7yrs older need prepare to fork out some cash for repair lo,btohqsg
No many of my pax complain,btohqsg
Say car high. Not used to it,btohqsg
Oh maybe ur side all used to sedan,btohqsg
But the general trend is going towards higher car like suv,btohqsg
I will say 99% Sinkies used to sedan. Already many female pax complain car high,btohqsg
higher car the view from uptop ma. Maybe clearer,btohqsg
Eh... i don think the statistic agrees with u though,btohqsg
Hi all  my car going scrap soon. Can i dekit my HKS Exhaust System before scrap so i can either install in new car/sell away?,btohqsg
I think I will switch back to sedan,btohqsg
Ur 99% from ur circle of friends?,btohqsg
Is legal exhaust  currently cert link to car number plater,btohqsg
If you can transfer it  why not,btohqsg
Kia showroom don even have a single sedan,btohqsg
The whole world is leaning towards suv though. Thats based on reports n survey worldwide,btohqsg
Still new to mods because when i bought the car  alrdy have the exhaust. Do i need to reinstall a stock exhaust kit?,btohqsg
New K Series debuting in 2025,btohqsg
If you want to dekit  then of course you need the stock exhaust. Or you intended to drive to scrapyard without any exhaust ?,btohqsg
Can i drive without exhaust? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Usually SUV got higher view ma. In a way  it makes the driver feel ore assured and confident cos you see more and from a higher view,btohqsg
I see google say possible. But cos first car owner  dw anyhow,btohqsg
Can. But whether you will kena stop by authorities or not  that's another question.,btohqsg
Get a buyer who is willing to swap their stock exhaust with you loh if thats your concern,btohqsg
Might look for stock exhaust on the market. Might want to put the exhaust on my next car,btohqsg
The exhaust compatible with your next car ?,btohqsg
Ya bro  planning get exact same model haha,btohqsg
Well  its people's preference ma. Maybe they value the viewing angle more than COG and all.,btohqsg
"Plus Suv i suppose you dont need to ""bend"" to get into the car. So more comfortable in that sense",btohqsg
View angle might as well drive trailer truck. 3x higher,btohqsg
Bigger n more road presence. All scared siam away from u.,btohqsg
U compare A3 and A4 interior  a hell lot of difference. Audi A4 got 1.4  so if u really want badge and space  go A4. But underpowered as hell,btohqsg
In HERE FOR A GOOD TIME NOT A LONG TIME,btohqsg
Its more family friendly and a good choice with bootspace and easy to climb into.,btohqsg
Yes of cus lah broðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ car no exhaust how drive,btohqsg
no too high some of the kids cried. Btw I fetch many pax a day,btohqsg
