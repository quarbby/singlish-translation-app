Acrometa rights XR on the 28th Dec 2022(Last Friday’s Market Depth and Time & Sales for reference )(Note: entitled to subscribe for the 1-1 $0.02 must hold until 28th Dec to be eligible to subscribe.)This means tomorrow  27th Dec 22 is to be the last day for anyone who wants to get $0.020 rights shares to buy.Hence  we might expect some buying frenzy here  as shown from Friday  buyers already started to come in with a later buyer coming in to Scoop $0.046 and $0.047 in a biteGood luck holders.IMO 2023 should be a good year for Acrometa due to their-(1) business growth and turnaround - top and bottom line increased -(2) improving maintenance business and- (3) Waste to energy business that they are building.My view is Acrometa ($0.047) should be an easy double bag counter in 2023. Put here first for easy reference in future.those who can hold can consider this counter. Might just be a dark horse 🐎,btohqsg
For easy read and understanding on Acrometa 3 core business. Pretty niche and good potential especially since these 3 segments grew in FY22 too where they turnaround from losses in past years to profit finally.https://acrometa.com/companies/#acro-harvest-engineering#whodoesnotlikeabusinessturnaround?,btohqsg
