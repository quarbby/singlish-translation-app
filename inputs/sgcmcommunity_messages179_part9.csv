It's either high risk or low risk   you can go for sgcarmart warranty cars,btohqsg
Hey folks  you all tried sg car quotz before? Can share what‚Äôs your experience‚Äôs like  e.g. paperwork  turnaround time  etc?Dont know if dealers quoting me correctly. ü•∫,btohqsg
If not urgent to sell consign,btohqsg
Mostly yes but not always true‚Ä¶ my fren just sold his Tucson at high 16k dep,btohqsg
Some cars in demand  those the dealers willing to take a smaller hit,btohqsg
From sgcarmart? Don't bother. All lowball ones,btohqsg
Best if you consign or sell yourself,btohqsg
Tall friend ah ‚Ä¶. Reposted IG ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg

Consign even worse. They will use the car to run personal errands,btohqsg
U dun leave ur car there bro,btohqsg
U usually just go there let them take pics,btohqsg
All the time I consign  they have never ask me to leave the car there,btohqsg
Then u continue drivin as per ur usage,btohqsg
Got potential then come set up appt,btohqsg
Some ppl do leave their car w dealer as consignment but mileage is strictly regulated by owner bro,btohqsg
Usually admin fee to buyer + loans comms,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to get some opinion  if I need car use  monthly loan 700  currently drive a cat b hybrid suv  mostly city driving and low usage  and anticipating cat b coe sure high in 2026 when my current coe ends  should I:A. Change to a cat A petrol suv now (monthly 1k to 1.2k); or B. Wait and see? But I think whether I change car in 2026 or renew coe  I expect monthly to go up to beyond 1.2k,btohqsg
you save a lot more driving your current car to the end,btohqsg
hybrid also helps you save more on fuel la,btohqsg
makes no sense to almost double your monthly to downgrade,btohqsg
why fork out DP + top up monthly to downgrade,btohqsg
If u sell current car  i assume u paid 30% or more DP when buying,btohqsg
How much u take back? In cash after clearing loans,btohqsg
And with ur installment so low  i assume u buy when cheap and ur depreciation probably lower than current market also,btohqsg
Cat b hybrid suv for 700  which car in particular?,btohqsg
At this climate how to find that kind of monthly? If change car can easily double the monthly payment,btohqsg
And in 2026 COE guarantee to be more ex? I think have chance for it to drop than for it to increase. Even if it increase  when you sell that time the value will still be good.,btohqsg
If u sell now at market rate how much can u take back?,btohqsg
wah that 21k also not much good,btohqsg
barely enough for DP for next car,btohqsg
No la. Got one PI advert 200+. He add battery n engine together,btohqsg
How much extra u gg to top in addition to 21k,btohqsg
Maybe 233hp for tht 0.1s when u step accelerator,btohqsg
The new car from pi  considering raize petrol 113k or yaris cross petrol  131k  dp flexible but monthly would be about 1.2k lo,btohqsg
don't itchy backside fall for peer pressure and what  not,btohqsg
Stick it out w ur current one,btohqsg
Now where can 700 per month monthly,btohqsg
Okie guys very valuable insight there üëçüëçüëç appreciate very much lolz,btohqsg
Don't get raize lol  I heard that it is underpowered. Yaris cross the FC I heard super good but the space very small  it is basically Vios with crossover body,btohqsg
Lol ok lucky I polled for opinion here,btohqsg
Raize look like mini rav4 but the whole interior full of cheap scratchable plastic  u push any of the panels got creaking noise,btohqsg
Imagine u change and pay double the installment every month for a shittier car,btohqsg
No one here wanna sabo U,btohqsg
Always remember dealers are out to scam u,btohqsg
Yaris cross also really cmi  u alr got hybrid car why bother abt petrol car fc,btohqsg
if corolla cross for that price maybe can consider,btohqsg
Underused lo  but yah I agree too,btohqsg
For hybrid to change to petrol  if cheaper ofc take it if underused,btohqsg
But ur hybrid cheap u want change to more exp petrol car,btohqsg
