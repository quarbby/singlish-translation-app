Anyone knows if Citi plus promo on singsaver is applicable for someone who has cancelled Citi credit card in the last 12-13 months,btohqsg
The question is you only work for 3 months after graduate n how they assess you have $80k of annual income. Banks usually use income tax assessments as a source to verify your income via MyInfo.,btohqsg
Actually I worked 1.5 yrs but previous year salary excluding bonus I only bag 80k. Was late into credit card game and only held onto a UOB card for 3 months,btohqsg
Since you only held uob credit card for 3 months  I guess your previous submission of income info is before this year income tax assessment period which starts around Apr 2023. So there is only two possibilities:1). UOB likely don‚Äôt have your income tax info.2). UOB strictly follow the rules on your application ie $120k.,btohqsg

Oo thanks for highlighting  I guess when I first started using theparking.sgapp maybe Amex wasn't an option for payment  tts y I used HSBC Advance for the cb  now I just changed to UOB absolute,btohqsg

Suggestion:Personally I took accident plan in AIA and later switched to Prudential since I'm working in IT and not a sports person if I remember correctly I claimed twice. Now my company has out patient benefit so I have cancelled. So it really depends on you to decide whether it is necessary and if you are taking it's better to take with the insurance company which approves claim fast and my suggestion would be AIA or Prudential,btohqsg
You should see the funds back in the srs by day end of 11 Jul.,btohqsg

To get sufficient coverage for your personal medical and hospitalization (shield) insurance is the MOST important and start when you are still young.  Medisave and company insurance is not sufficient. Better you get advice from an *independent* financial adviser  who can advise different insurance policies from different companies that suits your income level etc. It is to ensure that you can afford to pay the premium. My personal experience with Prudential so far is great  fast in processing claim.,btohqsg
Guess now old already too late,btohqsg
No harm to still get advice and find out the premium cost for you. If you can afford than why not. There may be exclusion of coverage or pay higher premium for certain existing condition to be covered.,btohqsg
Wondering if claim can stack company & personal hospitalized claim or only can submit one,btohqsg
Esp now cancer rate is high,btohqsg
The key reason to get medishield is that should you get so sick that you cannot work anymore  by that time  no insurance company will accept you and you will be hung dry without insurance.,btohqsg
Most group company insurance won't cover you full. There is amount limit  exclusions etc. The remaining amount  you can claim to your personal shield insurance  of course  also subject to your policy term.,btohqsg
So I can stack Medisave & co hospital insurance,btohqsg
In fact  if your personal insurance is the highest tier  it includes rider to cover own cash co-pay and Medisave  as such you won't need to pay anything. Although it may impact your next year's premium rate (i.e.  increase in premium) depending  again  your policy term.,btohqsg
