i realised why got 1 guy in shorts also pinning the guy down,btohqsg
I am useful  I am important,btohqsg
I am good for the community,btohqsg
but really wonder why will reach this extent,btohqsg
So they usually deploy a lot more force than required to de escalate,btohqsg
At least from what I see,btohqsg
No i mean like  why will become hostage,btohqsg
That one must ask the guy,btohqsg
I don't really care if police uses more force  as long as no one harmed  it's all ok,btohqsg
sometimes fb comments all very stupid one,btohqsg
"""brother why you hold hostage early in the morning  and old aunty at that""",btohqsg
ask why need 6 v1 that kind,btohqsg
Like if you rob someone  is snatch and go before police come ma,btohqsg

yup blk 110... i know tat clinic... one of my company customer,btohqsg
Yishun legit need to declare sovereign state already,btohqsg
We can give johor yishun alr,btohqsg
I think they don't want also,btohqsg
got drugs  got all these crimes,btohqsg
Later they move causeway into yishun,btohqsg
Then jam all the way to yishun dam,btohqsg
Also this is another reason to say,btohqsg
travel by there feel like causeway liao  just no custom only,btohqsg

Not sure..I see such exotic cars..I Siam or slow down,btohqsg

i thought will get stopped one,btohqsg
Even go malaysia also i tio cut so many time,btohqsg
Then i cnnt see my friend,btohqsg
I always tell him if exiting let me know,btohqsg
Cos i hide behind the car,btohqsg
Wa this@roincecalr hving a party there LOL,btohqsg
"""I'm at speed limit  you overtake me means you speeding""",btohqsg
I dont care if you going speed limit  i go 120kmh on lane 2 overtaking you means you hogging.,btohqsg
I keep to the 3rd laneüòÅ,btohqsg
The man who held a woman at knifepoint in Yishun will be charged in court on Tuesday. Preliminary investigations found that his urine tested positive for controlled drugs.https://str.sg/wFSH,btohqsg
Looks like we know why he did it already,btohqsg
I saw a Tesla launched itself off a traffic light.So i did every petrolhead a favour  I pulled up beside it at the next traffic light started revving my engine.Combustion engine 1 - 0 Electric Vehicles.,btohqsg
Why need rev the engine üòÖ,btohqsg
Cos i wanna challenge the EV to rev battle,btohqsg
Dont waste petrol on someone who doesnt appreciate gasoline engines. ü§≠,btohqsg
gd job bro gotta defend our title,btohqsg
COE gonna go up another 10k cos of this,btohqsg
Cat B and open cat prices be interesting to seeüòÅ,btohqsg
Doesn't matter la... It can go up and down for the next few years. You also won't change car üòÇ,btohqsg
If coes drop cheap enough i can buy supra leh,btohqsg
But now it comes with 6spds manual I thinküòÅ,btohqsg
The way it should only be sold,btohqsg
Wait for the 2.0T manual to come n sir roi be on it in no timeüòÅ,btohqsg

Lolx..same resistance when r35 came outü§≠ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
R35 only in DCT is already a shame,btohqsg
heng toyota still got some manual elitist,btohqsg
That one is a sorrow storyüòÅ,btohqsg
like how GR corolla only in manual,btohqsg
Have a healthy respect for Toyota üòÅ,btohqsg
At least they know n listen to fanboysüòÅ,btohqsg
but singapore still quite sad  alot of places dont wanna bring in manual options,btohqsg
Yesterday a friend told me when he told his parents he wanted to take manual  they tell him for what just go with auto,btohqsg
It's sad the parents say go for auto,btohqsg
i watch initial D and fast and furious,btohqsg
watch them change gear very cool,btohqsg
i nv thought of taking auto for that reason,btohqsg
I see taxi driver downshift in a turn,btohqsg
I can only do it with certain shoes,btohqsg
I watch this always think heel and toe is so fking cool,btohqsg
The day i bought my manual swift,btohqsg
i straight away learn how to heel toe,btohqsg
with millions of jerking motion LOL,btohqsg
What they don't tell you is  the car and your shoes need to be right to do it,btohqsg
I could never do it in the kia,btohqsg
have to get used to it la,btohqsg
i can do it in slipper too,btohqsg
I need like a wider base shoe to do it,btohqsg
but i wear boots daily  now i wear shoes,btohqsg
dunnid heel toe  just roll the pinky over,btohqsg
i wear shoes have to really heel toe,btohqsg
But then again your car sitting position very different,btohqsg
That day at s2c got to sit in the older gen one. Much lower then I imagined,btohqsg
i got a big transmission tunnel  so my pedals all also very close tgt,btohqsg
ltr i go lunch i take photo of my driver footwell,btohqsg
I think 6 already plenty HAHAHA,btohqsg
everyday do heel toe should look like that,btohqsg
Mmmm take manual because of initial D,btohqsg
I took manual because thats how cars were made at the time,btohqsg
Hence you can see who is still driving manual and who isn't,btohqsg
building lego also too much work,btohqsg
tat i agree... but when got jam  sibei sian,btohqsg
"Honestly even the enthusiast market is split with people that are ""lazy to daily a manual"" and all the excuse come out",btohqsg
The romance of manual was destroyed for me when i daily a pickup for work,btohqsg
Clutch and stick are the same to me,btohqsg
I also drive my company lorry sometimes,btohqsg
"car and ""heavy vehicle"" different feel",btohqsg
Just where ur biting point is,btohqsg
i drive before lorry and van  very different feel,btohqsg
everytime after i drive lorry i come back drive my car,btohqsg
cos the lorry clutch travel really very far,btohqsg
end up always a very loud thud when i just got back into my car,btohqsg
plus lorry engine also different from car engine. diesel taking forever to get to 3k rpm,btohqsg
wanted that but see only 3 cylinder,btohqsg
wah my sec sch teacher used to drive qq in manual,btohqsg
i sat his car before in sec sch,btohqsg
i only rmb i sit in my part time work boss's legacy GT,btohqsg
the first time i sat in a turbo car in sec sch,btohqsg
need ask the hk bus sister,btohqsg
imagine full load... dunno can move anot,btohqsg
must be enjoyable A to B... not until very frustrating,btohqsg
hence why we all want cvt,btohqsg
buy liao cannot poke my backside alr,btohqsg
I am sorry but i have to disagree. I pretty much daily a manual van for a good chunk and i still enjoy driving manual. Hell i have been in 8hours+ jams and i am still enjoying everytime i drive my car. Its the interaction between the driver and car. Your ability to make the car behave the way you want.If you dont appreciate manuals especially for a driver's car. I think you are better off just parking your car. Cos the most important point is driving,btohqsg
I always say this also  you buy a manual car to change gear. So jams let you change more gear.If you buy a manual but want to cruise on NSHW 6th gear all the way  buy auto suan le,btohqsg
same idea as jam = ur roadtax more worth huh,btohqsg
i stress. somemore diy headlights to blind ppl,btohqsg
Hence why i jam 6 hour from KL to SG i also nv kaopei  also nv wished i was in an auto car once,btohqsg
It's okay  i also love CVT  we same same,btohqsg
When you are on a good piece of road. Manual is what you wanna have,btohqsg
You get to have a interaction,btohqsg
rev match downshift  engine brake into the corner,btohqsg
Very happy for you! How are u going to make me park my car though.,btohqsg
manual  u know whats going on with the car cos u are in control,btohqsg
think i cannot go next to him though. tried but the engine crying alr.,btohqsg
i just hate the feeling of i press upshift  the gb take awhile to do it  or dowan to do it,btohqsg
tats cvt... doesnt listen to u one,btohqsg
ppl ask me if my car ev. cannot hear the exhaust,btohqsg
wa manual fans alot leh here,btohqsg
You will do it yourself i guess. üôà,btohqsg
we both appreciate manual alot one  we know how fulfilling manual cars can give.,btohqsg
dun use power steering also hor. more interaction,btohqsg
I did miss that level of control when on the b roads. During the other 99.99999%  i dont need it,btohqsg
And for 50% of that proportion i prefer not to have it,btohqsg
i got thought of deleting LOL,btohqsg
but ended up i fix my PS alr,btohqsg
so suan le just leave it,btohqsg
i was contemplating  remove PS pump or fix my pump,btohqsg
Delete email and return to fax,btohqsg
Precisely. Even actually during daily driving. A manual can be more fun too. I had a auto brz and felt it was very dreary but meanwhile i really enjoy my manual 86 day to day.,btohqsg
Wah so you from auto brz to manual 86 ah,btohqsg
My mx5 is also my 2nd mx5,btohqsg
i had an auto mx5 before also,btohqsg
It's fun but not enough  now manual it's perfect,btohqsg
In conclusionManual > autoIf u dont like manual  dont driveSignedClement and Roi,btohqsg
manual cars will die off sooner or later... enjoy while u still can,btohqsg
I had one about 9 cars back,btohqsg
About two + year gap iirc,btohqsg
2+ year you change 9 cars,btohqsg
Yes u shld see his ig,btohqsg
Its literally called play with cars,btohqsg
i can only play with my stick,btohqsg
I mean if you enjoy driving,btohqsg
manual is fun until you're stuck in traffic jam üò≠,btohqsg
OMG......ZF 8 speed is the way to go,btohqsg
in traffic jam  what you talking about,btohqsg
Cos coe so expensive then park car,btohqsg
Then i enjoy driving but my car auto,btohqsg
All the enjoyment i had on b road using paddle shifters has been invalidated,btohqsg
yst at CTE  crawling speed of 10km/h until sibei sleepy.. maybe manual can make u more awake,btohqsg
Auto rx8s have their own perks like a slightly longer gap per gear change and the ability to decouple and let engine still operate in 3rd gear at low maybe 10km/h but if having the stick to play with does help with a depth of connection to the car and the drive. Not to mention the ability to do clutch kicks to initiate an oversteer situation easier unlike most auto  unless you 7 dct swap and got the clutch kick button then more power to you,btohqsg
Im just disturbing@Playwithcarsla dont mind me,btohqsg
For me what i miss from a clutch is control over the engine brake,btohqsg
Now is press and no matter what it goes all the way in,btohqsg
We are in a chat called car discussions. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. So no need to act like a butthurt 12yo. When we are grown men. say a manual is the best option for driver's car. I had my good chunk of auto/dct. Hell my porsche is a auto. It serves well as a cruiser.,btohqsg
Nah i am just laughing at you,btohqsg
dont trigger la... everyone got own opinion de,btohqsg
12 yo busy with PSLE la  no time to be triggered,btohqsg
I mean  the same person says ‚Äúenjoy the car my way or else park it‚Äù also says ‚Äúentitled to own opinion‚Äù but it seems some entitlement are larger? üòú,btohqsg
Maybe its just choice of words but when u asked why triggered be careful not to get triggered yourself too üòâ,btohqsg
Talking to clement not u sir,btohqsg
its ok  need go back work le,btohqsg
Nah i park my auto at home,btohqsg
I was just joking with u bro but it seems like our frequency is different. Manual elitism is important part of your identity and I respect that,btohqsg
But just note when u go extreme with ‚Äúif u auto then may as well park‚Äù then return shots can and will be fired üòâEnd of story dont take it too serious,btohqsg
U ask roi lor i always disturb him,btohqsg
Yeah. Only drive once or twice a week. To cruise about.,btohqsg
Relax. I dont take you seriously too haha,btohqsg
Thats why his sally also always parked,btohqsg
Having 2 coe is not a financially viable option for many,btohqsg
Would love to have that as well but just thankful to have one,btohqsg
If a japanese manual sports car can make you drive it daily over a porsche,btohqsg
there was a time I thought manual was the way to go. but after changing to auto  I was expecting to miss it but didn't. and i still do enjoy the drives i have.,btohqsg
I came from an automatic so i cannot really relate,btohqsg
if given a choice  sure i'd have a manual & an auto car for different occasions.,btohqsg
But i can say is  i definitelt have more fun in my manual mx5 than the auto one i used to have,btohqsg
How often you in a jam,btohqsg
if you're talking mx5 to mx5  definitely i'd go for manual. but i changed from swift sport to F30.,btohqsg
I think most car enthusiasts wont disagree manual offer more fun than auto. Where the divide happens is whether u want it for the daily meaning the jams  the mscps and so on,btohqsg
And then u have people with enough money for both and can park the auto,btohqsg
I old alr. I think my left leg cnt keep up the good clutch work.,btohqsg
I get ya'll feel so strongly about manual. But I dont see auto drivers reacting like that. üåö jut saying,btohqsg
Theres a reason the running gag is ‚Äúmanual elitist jerks‚Äù,btohqsg
Manual auto petrol ev  doesnt matter as long as u are still a gearhead..,btohqsg
Soon we will all be driving manuals,btohqsg
exactly. shouldn't be trying to draw lines. otherwise shouldnt even be in this chat,btohqsg
Ev no pop pop me no like,btohqsg
you can choose the type of pop you want even better.,btohqsg
Can go exhaust sound tuning too,btohqsg
I was going to say when the battery explode,btohqsg
Its just funny how after years of r&d on how to make ice cars quieter  suddenly the opposite problem presents itself,btohqsg
Too quiet is very scary one,btohqsg
U try one time EV u know liao,btohqsg
There was some complaint that tesla a lot of wind noise. Someone pointed out that its not really the sound insulation sucks‚Ä¶ its the car is too quiet,btohqsg
Soln is to play music LOL,btohqsg
I think can invest in a solid sound system for EV,btohqsg
Theres one very nicely done up model 3,btohqsg
I hear one before.. i tot supercar driving up the mscp  i waited for awhile  an atlis came by..,btohqsg
If u want to know what tesla look like when lowered,btohqsg
When u go buy tesla that time jio me,btohqsg
i'll ask you to rev it,btohqsg
then i beside rev rev with you,btohqsg
For once my exhaust will sound loud,btohqsg
But this only applies to bikers. They more prone to accidents risks. That's why they need to be more louder,btohqsg
But their loud is like those rattling cans kind of loud  now  thats annoying lol..,btohqsg
You meant 2 stroke bikes? Ya that one is different loud,btohqsg
This sentence come from u is giving a migraine,btohqsg
If you hear r1 or cbr1000rr or s1000krr. That one is real loud and sweet mamamia,btohqsg
This kind of loud is nice..,btohqsg
But I like f1 loud exhaust leh. How?,btohqsg
Imagine a harley just sneaks pass u  what?! Is that still a harley üòÇ,btohqsg
Hahha Hayley just make a new breakthru man,btohqsg
Its LTA approved. U got no say bro.,btohqsg
Im sure their sales drop üòÖ,btohqsg
u can always make ur own sound,btohqsg
Take slipper slap floor is very similar to pop and bang,btohqsg
Water bottle better  got abit bassy echo..,btohqsg
Hahah. Tears would be Ê∂ô„ÄÇÊàª„Çã is return,btohqsg
And based on that u can infer the real meaning haha,btohqsg
I ordered these online  didnt get shinobu,btohqsg
