I see  do you mean using 2 separate UOB lady solitaire cards? Sadly Iâ€™m not at that income level haha,btohqsg
Then wwmc as Chris said.U can also consider Maybank horizon visa signature for 2.8mpd on air tickets (direct airline purchase),btohqsg
Regarding WWMC  does the online transaction need to be in foreign currency for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Any idea if the $80 shopee vouchers are stackable with the usual spend and use vouchers we can claim from shopee?,btohqsg
Think can only combine with free shipping voucher + store voucher (if any).The $80 cash voucher is only use at the non-store voucher section.Shoppeepeepeepee,btohqsg
Anyone here cancelled a stan chart card before? Mind telling me what the email/sms look like?I cancelled my smart credit card last year around this time but I could not find back the confirmation of the cancellation.,btohqsg
Is qualifying spend date based on transaction date or posting date for UOB?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think have any confirmation notification.Have woh. Proven below,btohqsg
Can i link standard chartered simply cash credit card to amaze?,btohqsg
Just signed up mine but when i tried to link  it says card declined.,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to check if i purchase klook gift card from heymax  isit stackable in klook platform or only can use 1 gift card per purchase only?,btohqsg
Hi there  can we topup amaze wallet using credit card?,btohqsg
Can load into acct then use. So it is stackable in this sense,btohqsg
Yes but there is fee been charge when u top up by credit card,btohqsg
Meaning eg the 200 or 300 e klook voucher that i bought from heymax will be the klook credit in my klook account? So i offset from there?,btohqsg
Any kind soul can help to check if DBS Altitude 5mpd still have slots? I canâ€™t see it in my PayLah app,btohqsg
hello  if i were to sign up for citi rewards card now (new to citibank) and i buy an item  ie  an iphone from apple store and i have linked the card to amaze  does that qualify for the qualifying spend for singsaver?,btohqsg
Does topping up ezlink card with maybank family n friend card count as eligible spending for transport category,btohqsg
Amaze no longer support credit card top up since 15th July,btohqsg
Thanks. What abt buying ntuc voucher on amazon. Does it count as online shopping category?,btohqsg
test mcc using Amaze+wallet with insufficient funds,btohqsg
hi! anyone knows?UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Cardholders will also earn 10X UNI$ per S$5 (4 mpd) on mobile contactless payments.Does it count if the payment is made through the Shell SmartPay? or do I need to go to counter to tap my phone?would appreciate any help thanks!,btohqsg
If u go thru app it need to be in online whitelist  if u go counter mobile contactless then u sure get 4mpd,btohqsg
This one doesn't stack with Singsaver right? The recent Journey card did.,btohqsg
Why not purchase it online and collect at store? Also how much? Cuz there is 1% fee above 1k for amaze.,btohqsg
Hello  anyone knows if citi allows to pay rent/ utilities etc via citi pay all on behalf of family & friends ?,btohqsg
hmm  was thinking of splitting the payment with two cards  maximize the 1k limit w both  so was just wondering if it's possible  is buying it online the better way to qualify for this spending (and get the singsaver reward)?,btohqsg
yea it is  just a little unsure of how the qualifying spend works and if one ticket (1k) would qualify it ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
As long as u spend $500 qualifying transaction  u will get entitled.Thats why ppl purchase shopping vouchers to qualify.My advice if u wanna split  go down to shop and tell them to split transaction. 1k on amaze+crcm and the rest of whichever,btohqsg
ah ok that's nice  thank you!,btohqsg
i believe mcc is 8062. based on the your mentioned cost and hospital options  congrats if its to deliver a baby (but sorry if im wrong).1. HSBC Advance $2800 cap @ 2.5%2. If you are eligible for Amex highflyer then thats 1.8mpd uncapped3. If not  AMEX TCB orSCB Simply cash is 1.5% uncapped Do note previous dps suggests thomson medical does not accept amex. mount A not sure  parkway east states they accept amex on their website.I believe the above is accurate but do correct me if i am wrong.,btohqsg
Scb no more hospital if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
Oh gosh! You are right. Scb excluded 8062 from last month.,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. brilliant guess. Ok thanks for the info!,btohqsg
As Chris mentioned  only Singsaver offer for your UOB Lady. If you dont want to waste ur NTB status  you can consider UOB PRVI MILES first (esp visa version). UOB buffed it sign up bonus and earn rate for overseas slightly.,btohqsg
UOB PRVI buff3mpd for FCY in Msia  Indo  Thailand  Vietnam(New) 4 lounge visits (priority pass)https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/prvi-miles-card.page,btohqsg
boss@ChrisHMSGmay be can update your uob prvi miles post,btohqsg
The lounge visits seem don't allow guests.,btohqsg
Not bad since they also added overseas website,btohqsg
Trust card also can earn link points for hospital  I tried before,btohqsg
Omg. thanks! That's correct too. Many apologies. Really must research deeper to navigate the exclusions.,btohqsg
I think some high end cards give miles for private hospital. On top of my head is ocbc voyage.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB one bonus interest  does it include spend from recurring investment product?,btohqsg
see the exclusion list  likely to be excluded,btohqsg
I read from internet  it only didn't qualify for UOB cashback.,btohqsg
How do you pay for the recurring investment using credit card? Which company ?,btohqsg
I think snack income allows cc?,btohqsg
uob one account card spend  has the same exclusion except for insurance mcc,btohqsg
thank you  this is very useful,btohqsg
this hospital/insurance/school exclusion is a hot mess.honestly i am often not sure myself and I will make it a point to read the latest TNC of the card I am using before I spend.hospital can also be broken down into private and public  which makes it even harder.,btohqsg
