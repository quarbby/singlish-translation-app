Broadway ($0.152/$0.153) is intriguing  isn‚Äôt it. It fell when the news was really positive. Similar to what Yinda and GKE on a positive announcement. ‚ÄòA good o‚Äô flushing‚Äô I reckon. Look where GKE and Yinda are at now. Been watching the PA since yesterday. In fact there were strong buyers coming in to collect at $0.164 and $0.165 yesterday at the start of the trading day (big mouth) but then they let it free fall. Earlier today $0.152 was stacked and buyers came into support this level too. Tomorrow will be interesting  considering an inverted hammer forming today after a strong bearish candle. Let‚Äôs see. Good luck to us BW holders still. üôèüèª Should see some üí™üèº buying momentum come back as they looks to be collecting $0.150 to $0.154 today IMO.,btohqsg
Why is the news positive that Broadway sold all their manufacturing business?,btohqsg
