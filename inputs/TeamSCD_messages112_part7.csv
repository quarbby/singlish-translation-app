I know. HAHAH they can be pretty fucked.,btohqsg
sry ah no euro s here hor,btohqsg
I've seen this 200sx at sgcarmart with R34 taillights,btohqsg
@ANBU_ARASANwants to get the euro s manual next,btohqsg
I am the kind that want a IS250 in manual,btohqsg
We shall follow@ANBU_ARASANgo view the auro s. Hahaha,btohqsg
Hahaha...Nowadays also hard to find parts,btohqsg
Got a reason why it was used to be known as the ahbeng civic,btohqsg
BUT I STILL LOVE CIVIC. IDKY.,btohqsg
karting day u try my swift la  not the fastest but should be enough to satisfy 😅,btohqsg
Thing is  I haven't done my previous civic to the best of its potential yet. So that's why i still very 更更于怀,btohqsg
I think hard tbh. But I'll give it a try first.,btohqsg
drive around changi/expo that side ah if u want,btohqsg
Sooner or later more EVs and Hybrids on the road,btohqsg
Because its just a 1 Yr car. And it piang before  did a heart transplant  hence the name 2.2 civic. Haha. Thr alr cost me a bunch. Along the way  I feel like a lot things gg to brk down alr  axis  suspend  bumper etc all needed to change. But left 6 months and I haven't renew road tax. So is damn half fuck. Fix also like wasted  dont fix scared die  zeng also bohua. So i just sell.,btohqsg
No pops and bangs anymore  I guess?,btohqsg
Blue SG sounded kinda weird imo,btohqsg
If u hear a EV pop that means the lithium contacts short circuits and a 14 000 deg C fire is about to commence,btohqsg
It make the r35 exos flame look like a pussy,btohqsg
Now  can you imagine a convoy of Blue SG,btohqsg
LET THE PAST BE THE PAST,btohqsg
The meet/convoy can be named BLUEBALLS,btohqsg
I rather pay petrol drive own car,btohqsg
Otw to tuning.. fc nt bad hor? Hahaha,btohqsg
