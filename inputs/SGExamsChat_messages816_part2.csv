A chair u can definitely feel the tangible difference,btohqsg
I feel like any1 can understand it for a chair,btohqsg
yea bc a bad chair is obviously harmful but the same logic applies to anything functional,btohqsg
Gonna need to wait a goddam week for the nippers to arrive,btohqsg
duh she on world tour now,btohqsg
Maybe if i go study music instead  i will be more successful,btohqsg
I heard she caught a big tuna in hokkaido,btohqsg
As aespa said only if you see her at sold-out shows,btohqsg
Anyone wants tixs to my world tour in japan,btohqsg
Could only see em at sold-out shows truly manifested,btohqsg
It doesnt cover air tickets unfortunately,btohqsg
Also 4 words summons lestin. Aespa  Stayc  Kpop and bad grades,btohqsg
youve never met me but yet you know me better than some friends i have,btohqsg
Well technically we have met. We just didn't know.,btohqsg
Idk if I can bid for mods,btohqsg
Would be funny to do so,btohqsg
Come with me. Aespa is doing it in Macau too there's RV too,btohqsg
is it too late to apply for LOA,btohqsg
There's Gidle as well if u wan the deal to be sweeter,btohqsg
Just say mental health leave :D,btohqsg
All groups of which ive attended (or going to attend) concerts for,btohqsg
Y2S2 has killed me  pls grant mental health leave,btohqsg
but you won’t get to be taught by me,btohqsg
Can I get taught by you if I use my BDE?,btohqsg
You need to take a prereq,btohqsg
Why cannot just leeroy Jenkins in,btohqsg
It is a mod which is also compulsory for physics minors :D,btohqsg
I am assuming he teaches 3101?,btohqsg
tbh more importantly is linear algebra,btohqsg
Is the applied or physics track more popular?,btohqsg
but his batch specifically a lot of pure,btohqsg
I would say more compared to last few batches,btohqsg
Hmm I would assume applied more cuz more industrial applications so more marni,btohqsg
Tbh I was quite surprised more ppl chose pure,btohqsg
yea that’s the perception usually and pure is seen as more theory so more for those interested in academia,btohqsg
but the difference isn’t that big between the two,btohqsg
Plus they have more stuff for the applied side,btohqsg
And also 2nd major in quantum tech,btohqsg
I mean what did I expect every mod for the Minor is a physics mod,btohqsg
Yall don't have interdisciplinary or like common mods between SPMS or like NTU meh,btohqsg
Yeah rn I shopping for options I officially a Second Major in Philo liao but sianz as it will take all my BDE,btohqsg
I mean like for Minors and majors itself,btohqsg
Ps0001 and ps0002 are coding mods done with math and chem students,btohqsg
Cuz I surprisingly can probably map out a Minor in AI as there are CoHASS mods there,btohqsg
Currently I am doing a math minor :/,btohqsg
No CoHASS mods tho :( I need em to double count,btohqsg
U did the double count stonks too for your minor,btohqsg
Or u legit 15 AU BDE,btohqsg
6 Au => 7 AU from my double count,btohqsg
9au I did 1 3 au mod and 1 4 au mod,btohqsg
