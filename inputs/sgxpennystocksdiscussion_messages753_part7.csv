A great set of result. Retails sales fell more than expected which helps in inflation.Core PPI also fell sharply which means producers faced less inflation and is less likely to pass on to consumers.Hopefully  it helps the market as the weaker retail sales may also cause much recession worry.These days  it is tough to get a delicate balance of economic data.Next  at 10.15 pm  we will get the industrial data result. See you later!,btohqsg
The data is bad and it might also spark hard landing and deep recession fear.On the flip side the Fed might be able to tone down some level of aggressive monetary tightening.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review 19 Jan 2023🎉🎈Fed maintained hawkish stance🔫Despite the latest economic data from PPI suggesting that inflation could trend downwards  the comments by Fed's Bullard were on the same hawkish melody.Investors were hoping for a more dovish Fed  thus  took a chance to take profit off the table after a good run in January.Bullard is firm on bringing the Fed funds rate to above 5%  which is seen as a restrictive monetary zone for the economy. Therefore  it is likely to stay elevated for a prolonged time too.📪What's the data for today?📠At 9.30 pm  we will have Building Permits data and Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index (Jan) data  which will further shed insights on the economy's strength.Observe that the 283.10 rejection level was particularly strong and upon hitting it  the index went downward spiral.It has been a challenging trading night as we gave up some profits for the month and looked forward to better trading days ahead!,btohqsg
