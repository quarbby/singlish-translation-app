Lalamove is best delivery app in singapore. It allows all drivers to witness how sinkies abuse sinkies and how sinkies pawn sinkies.  Customers simply abuse drivers with the platform,btohqsg

Suddenly they can't read.  They can't read car job not for Abv 20kg   they can't read mpv is 2x25kg.  They can't read delivery time is 1hour.  They simply abuse and scold even delivered on the 50th min.,btohqsg
While they abuse   is lalamove assisting them by abusing us with threats over our ratings?  I came across customers threatening me I have to fetch them else they giving me with a one star rating,btohqsg
That's simply beyond fucked up man,btohqsg
For this case you can reject them and when you got one star rating just go to lanlan office to get back your rating just spend some time and parking fee  customer is not always right,btohqsg
Provided you have strong and correct reason,btohqsg
So we need to video it down or record down what the customers said,btohqsg
Also got once deliver cake.  Customer a sender looking for driver at 3pm.  Receiver said he was expecting it at 3pm. Traffic jam   so collected at 330  passed to receiver at 430. Suppose receiver to pay.  He took the cake   saying I was late for over an hour. He ran away with the cake.  Found him in a restaurant.  He refused to pay claiming I could have reached in 20mins.  So I recorded what he said.  I told him   well   since u wasted so much of my time   I lodging a police report against u with u not wanting to pay for a service rendered   I will make u spend more time with the police.  Then he insisted on paying me.  I was rather reluctant to receive as I am better off with not receiving the $20 and see him spend time with the investigations. Bo bian he paynow.,btohqsg
