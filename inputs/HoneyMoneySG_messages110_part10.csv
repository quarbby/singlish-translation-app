Any recommendations for a card for wedding purchases?,btohqsg
Guys and ladies.Any of you do apply for the DBS attitude card. I feel is quite difficult to get . Need to spend 3k within 2 months  to get 53k miles including annual fee pay of 197,btohqsg
I personally feel is easier 2 years ago for citi premier miles spend 800 within 2 months to get about 30k miles. Within 1 month I already spend 380 on Chinese new year dinner. Remaining 2 months split into 2 months eat and shop.,btohqsg
If no choice can still buy vouchers if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Mainly payment for banquet dinner and wedding shoots  car rentals  photography,btohqsg
You’re planning to use one card for all? It also depends on whether they allow you to split payments for different cards and what your banquet quote their mcc as to reap the most rewards,btohqsg
Haha currently I only have city bank cashback plus card. So I guess i only have this 2 options atm.,btohqsg
Most cashback cards should cover your banquet and wedding shoots. Miles is probably more restrictive with mcc in place and the max cap for bonus miles,btohqsg
1 thing bad about hsbc 1 travel card is.Can't use for card up to earn miles.And also has expire date . Compare to dbs attitude card & citi premier miles.,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know why dental clinics show 2MPD for citi premier miles card on heymax? Isit inaccurate and should be 1.2 MPD?Also would like to check if I do an installment plan with a dental clinic where they deduct money from my card monthly  would that be seen as online payment hence I should use card for 4MPD online payments? Or seen as offline payments?,btohqsg
2mpd is foreign currency. Installment no 4mpd of cos,btohqsg
Oh the moment u make instalment there’s no 4MPD even if you use e.g a card 4MPD with online payments?,btohqsg
