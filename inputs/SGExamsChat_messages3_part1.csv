You’re YI now  if your team is still tribalistic into the YJ IJ divide  you clearly failed to effectively merge the school.,btohqsg
You fail to bring the team onto the same page,btohqsg
For me at least  it was a situation where my TA was talking about her ex-student and casually mentioned that they were from TPJC,btohqsg
"I don't think they're ""ashamed"" of their past  in a sense",btohqsg
I doubt teachers identify with their schools that much,btohqsg
Many of them have to swap schools very often,btohqsg
In fact a lot of merged schools have no culture,btohqsg
The merger is nothing more than another swap,btohqsg
the naming scheme is still stupid though,btohqsg
Maybe they should rename the schools,btohqsg
I’m disappointed the transition batch’s SL Pres didn’t start an alumni grp tbh,btohqsg
they shld never have combined the names,btohqsg
I had an interaction with him before  I just find it ironic....,btohqsg
I would love it if we were called Aurora JC,btohqsg
they should let the students give submissions and vote for the sch name lol,btohqsg
Something along the lines of Eunoia,btohqsg
i saw the new school song,btohqsg
So at least we have a nice school name,btohqsg
Aurora JC? At this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country?,btohqsg
what the heck is this hahahaha,btohqsg
Btw guys where do you find the Uni apps PIN number?,btohqsg
Nus so high tech! Still relying on snail mail!,btohqsg
Thanks thanks hahahah mina my bae,btohqsg
More like it’s not like we have nationally registered email and jc students check their email frequently,btohqsg
should you automatically be admitted into NUS Computer Science if you are a white hacker and get into their system,btohqsg
Jc students do check regularly though,btohqsg
yeah i checked mine once a month,btohqsg
idk why but it feels a bit cringe,btohqsg
cant tell whether the previous sch song was worse,btohqsg
For realsies? Nus has a bug bounty program on hackerone  so you should use that instead of attacking production servers cause that's illegal,btohqsg
Does it say who wrote it?,btohqsg
And they just changed their software so go whack!!,btohqsg
Some random guy named Terrence Huang in collab with yijc yeachers,btohqsg
Wtf outsource to somebody with no connection?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the cut off for law?,btohqsg
Can somebody who does music play this piece? Hahaha I wanna hear how it sounds,btohqsg
90 kekehonestly tho high 80 probably got chance,btohqsg
Or is there a software I can upload it to to play it for me,btohqsg
i play music but i lazy cause the key signatures are a big headache lol,btohqsg
also i quit piano 2 years ago so,btohqsg
but i can alr hear the song in my head,btohqsg
I could secretly record it on monday,btohqsg
I could put it on musescore@Hamsomy3@chemcer,btohqsg
I don't actually have an instrument at home,btohqsg
I have no idea what that is  but if it is not too much trouble  please do,btohqsg
