Not belittling the youngsters  just curious.,btohqsg
I dont think @si cario is belittling them.I know for a fact that alot of uni undergrads are making $10k a month buying into limited items and reselling them. They are smart business kids,btohqsg

Siaoness. My parents wont lend me a single cent.,btohqsg
I am $4mil in debt. Downpaid $2m with husband.,btohqsg
Since you are interested maybe I can give some insightFor guys - NS pay is about 800 to 1k a mth  so if you stay in like me and don't go to canteen everyday  don't chiong and hang flower  by the end of NS can save about 10k to 15kFor both male and female undergrads  some do part time jobs like tuition  some do research studies (like me  I do clinical trials because I earn the most amt of money from them) and some females... I won't mince my words la  some go looking for sugar daddies,btohqsg
But 10k a mth is very rare if at all. Maybe if they trade forex  or give tuition everyday or something. Realistically I think 2k max from part time jobs for undergrads,btohqsg
My cousin is earning 3k/mth in Uni by teaching tuition.,btohqsg
If tuition teach everyday  how to study?,btohqsg
This one will have to do group tuition. Not easy to find a group nowadays from what I hear. Usually  it's 1 on 1 or 1 on 2,btohqsg
It is one to one tuition.,btohqsg
Now a lot of tuition over Zoom ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
These kids are very resourceful.My relative's son in American Intl sch...you know the intl sch is in Woodlands  so they live in orchard area and school bus picks them up.And cos it is a long bus ride  he goes to ntuc and buys chocs and snacks  break bulks them and sell them to other students on the bus for a premium (like cheers and 7-11 ðŸ˜…)That is how he pays for his Tod's shoes ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Maybe that's why can teach many subjects,btohqsg
Wow that's quite high. Usually the rate is around 25 to 30 per hour for undergrads teaching sec sch or pri sch. If teaching A levels or undergrad level  maybe top up about 5 per hour,btohqsg
Lol when someone appear start talking aboutTuitionProperty buyingFinancial freedomBlah blahSiren soundsPee poo pee poo,btohqsg
