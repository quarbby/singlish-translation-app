Most of them are from the dorms,btohqsg
Which is sad but not surprising,btohqsg
JUST IN:Singapore sees a record 287 new COVID-19 cases  with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.Links have also been found between the clusters at Mustafa Centre  the Project Glory construction site and a number of dormitories.https://cna.asia/2XmlBIo,btohqsg
Thought: This is exactly why SAF cancelled BMT,btohqsg
the MO didnt want to deal with sick recroots,btohqsg
"46 unlinked shouldnt warrant an ""only"" suffixed",btohqsg

Know that your theme is not restricted to the dictionary definition of the word,btohqsg
but like every topic eg ageing population issues,btohqsg
eg dementia has alot of soln?,btohqsg
then some rare topic like certain organ donation is like no secondary data related to singapore?,btohqsg
you cant look at it so broadly,btohqsg
you need to find a niche,btohqsg
there are alot of solution targeting ageing population,btohqsg
but do they solve the same problem?,btohqsg
our group did some rare disease but the problem is no much secondary data?,btohqsg
we dont know what we dont know,btohqsg
Alternatively  think about a problem YOU face  and see whether you're part of a trend,btohqsg
Are you that comfortable with your life?,btohqsg
No but my problems are too ‚Äòcommon‚Äô,btohqsg
like what my PW tutor likes to say,btohqsg

Serious ah? Then people either bring Nokias or non camera smartphone?,btohqsg
Even now  certain places still don't allow camera phones,btohqsg
You can't remove iPhone camera that easily,btohqsg
Scratch until pitch black cannot see anything,btohqsg
Diy also cannot need some professional tool one,btohqsg
At least that was CO directive,btohqsg
Destroying the camera? Not worth the money,btohqsg
You went to red zone eh? Pretty sad  cuz can't use Snapchat,btohqsg
Not evenRed zone still implies clerk life which is still good in the grand scheme of things,btohqsg
i gonna wait for a few days,btohqsg
My battalion got fked in MP raid then CO ban camera phone for 2 months,btohqsg
SAF non admin vocations are tough?,btohqsg
dw to sit thr and look at it drop 30%,btohqsg
Bet admin and non admin admin defo win,btohqsg

GRF is one of my interests,btohqsg
The only frontline quote unquote i see b4 were the changi patrol dudes,btohqsg
Oh ProCom? Yeah that  and Transcom is both Frontline,btohqsg
The patrol dudes some of them at least,btohqsg
Yeah they legit nothing to do,btohqsg
Most of the time  except for GRF  the frontline people don't have much to do  coz most people are scared to commit crimes,btohqsg
Damn this is their frontline lol,btohqsg
And they get risk pay also,btohqsg
Slackest active training month of my nsf time sia,btohqsg
If they corporal  risk pay+Food allowance makes their allowance go to $900,btohqsg

i feel he'll keep pumping money until he leaves office,btohqsg
cuz he dun wanna be the recession guy,btohqsg
he can still get voted into office no?,btohqsg
hes good for the businesses ba,btohqsg
they know the Fed will hand hold them even if they mess up,btohqsg
so business owners tend to vote trump,btohqsg
i think he will lose because how he handle corona,btohqsg
wah if he wins means a decade of trump,btohqsg
Thats why he scapegoat china  and ppl might just become more anti-Asian with asians becoming the scapegoat so he might still be okay,btohqsg
if markets are green on monday im  gonna punch someone,btohqsg
The debates will mostly about COVID-19,btohqsg
im on a lot of angmoh chatrooms they all being damn racist rn blame asians,btohqsg
Ya but voters will think eh why trump nvr protect us from the china virus,btohqsg
Nah i think they wont think so much,btohqsg
If they have  they wont have voted for him back then,btohqsg
only a minority blaming trump  most are just blindly racist,btohqsg
for sg we can implement measures no prob,btohqsg
i think for us they rather focus on ensuring their economy stays afloat,btohqsg
dt they want to prioritize lowering numbers alr,btohqsg

I‚Äôll leave this up because it‚Äôs a good cause  but please ask for permission to advertise first in the future,btohqsg

Anyone has any tips for NTU online interview,btohqsg

Ahh okay great at least i wont be caught off guard if they asks these,btohqsg
Wtf i got no offer from NTU yet,btohqsg
uhhhhhh i think it's because i picked courses closest to my rp?,btohqsg
idk maybe they are just getting to you late,btohqsg
@ketnipdi sold. i hope it doesnt go up,btohqsg
its either win a lot or lose a lot,btohqsg
Theres only one course which is slightly above my RP,btohqsg
then maybe your courses popular -3-,btohqsg
i dont dare to bet on that,btohqsg
now even if it goes up it wont go up to pre corona levels,btohqsg
bc if it does then this shit doesnt make sense,btohqsg
i lost today all i earned last night,btohqsg
i need to think more carefully,btohqsg
no i left that blank because i have no talent whatsoever,btohqsg
Maybe coz aba they delay for me,btohqsg
they set a restriction on oil production iirc,btohqsg
even tho i wanted bet on it,btohqsg
ya lo u buy when u dun geddit,btohqsg
cuz i hear a lot rumours,btohqsg
i think i gna do long term from now on,btohqsg
i will wait 4 a drop 1st haha,btohqsg
but idk why a lot bulls recently,btohqsg
and they all make earnings cuz of it,btohqsg
because fed promised that the stock mkt will go up,btohqsg
lmao and where is that news coming from,btohqsg
that i dont know of üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
theyre giving unlimited qe by buying junk bonds and corporate bonds ma,btohqsg
they cant sit thr and let the market freefall,btohqsg
Chill i asked around. None of the ABA ppl got,btohqsg
but nobody rly knows what it is,btohqsg
theyll handle it when it comes,btohqsg
but as of now u cant let ppl go homeless and unemployed,btohqsg
so pump in money first ma,btohqsg
i think unemployment stays the same,btohqsg
think itd be worse if they did ntg,btohqsg
that it'll affect the entire world economy,btohqsg
everytg i say is also jz my opinion only la  im not an expert on this,btohqsg
honestly nobody knows if itll go up or down at this point,btohqsg
which i honestly dont wanna participate in,btohqsg
bad for mental health oso i think,btohqsg
i not stress oso cuz i put in what i can lose,btohqsg
got some paid trading membership platforms,btohqsg
i heard got a lot some more,btohqsg
as in the leader ask the grp pump in money cuz its gonna rise,btohqsg
then cuz its large volume it works,btohqsg
and membership can be up to thousands,btohqsg
they make an impact if they got enough capital lor,btohqsg
except if u get caught u get prosecuted,btohqsg
haha at this point i feel just do whatever u want haha,btohqsg
damn laze and its not a trading day anw haha,btohqsg
i heard that it's basically 'pulling a wolf of wallstreet',btohqsg
but i didnt watch that movie so idk if accurate anot,btohqsg
i beetter see ur ass in ntu next yr,btohqsg
also this is @ the ppl going ntu from mi ok YALL BETTER FUCKING COME BACK,btohqsg
if i could skip the hookers parts,btohqsg
but next year im still in ns???,btohqsg
i dont like seeing people being demeaned or degeneracy in general,btohqsg
then the next next year i'm still in ns???,btohqsg
The next 6 years im still in NS ?,btohqsg
err i just got my pes for ns,btohqsg
so im just gonna shake leg in ac room for 2 years?,btohqsg
idk man i think it might depend on where they send you to in the end,btohqsg
tbh i dont feel like im very physically disabled but i think they know im somehwat mentally challenged,btohqsg
sucks tho this ns is gonna cut through my uni life,btohqsg
There aren‚Äôt many vocations available for E boys,btohqsg
At least it‚Äôs just uni life,btohqsg
So you‚Äôre free after your 2 years,btohqsg
All the available vocations are just clerks under different names,btohqsg
yeah but still  it kinda interrupts ur study path esp when syllabus is constantly changing,btohqsg
why are u complaining when you don't even need to wear a helmet,btohqsg
cuz i care about my academic performances?,btohqsg
academic excellence isnt the only key to success,btohqsg
if everyone thinks like that  sg is fked,btohqsg
or else ppl wont choose the poly route,btohqsg
yep try telling that to my mom,btohqsg
ah i see the parental pressure  understandable,btohqsg
Implying you can‚Äôt achieve academic excellence in poly,btohqsg
quite some ppl choose poly as a diploma allows them to start work upon graduation,btohqsg
Guess 4.0 GPA isn‚Äôt academic excellence,btohqsg
u sound like poly ppl arent very keen in academic performances,btohqsg
doesnt necessarily mean its not academically rigorous,btohqsg
but at the end of the day  a considerable amt of ppl choose poly because it allows them to work in a related field of study upon graduation,btohqsg
@binsonnnnjust googled  apparently the film is more about hedonism drugs and hookers than the financial market  exactly what im tryna avoid,btohqsg
as much as it is a classic i probably wont watch it,btohqsg
and how do u graduate to work in your desired field?,btohqsg
u have an easier life than many others for NS alr,btohqsg
im just saying it cuts thru my uni which sucks and most ppl in my classes do agree they prefer having a more vigorous ns life to having their uni lives disturbed,btohqsg
What do you mean by ‚Äòdisturbing uni‚Äô,btohqsg
by ur logic  if i cant complain because other people are suffering worse  then only one person on is world is allowed to complain and that is the most unfortunate person on this world,btohqsg
Yc whats your desired Uni course of study,btohqsg
i had a lot of medical issues so my enlistment was postponed indefinitely for a very long period of time,btohqsg
its called ''count ur blessings''. Your complaints are unjustified.,btohqsg
to not waste time i went to uni first,btohqsg
Plus u will prob have much more time than others to study in NS cos of ur vocation,btohqsg
U finally clarified the situation :0,btohqsg
yep and i am in chem eng,btohqsg
I‚Äôve heard a lot of people got their Enlistment date Super late,btohqsg
I never actually heard of anyone who got it so late they went uni first,btohqsg
oh wow how far in are you,btohqsg
that's a really shitty situation to be in,btohqsg
well i have a lot of special cases so its hard for me to compare with everyone else XD,btohqsg
only up to A levels and equivalent,btohqsg
by right NS cant be deferred for Uni  his one sounds live v special case le,btohqsg
i know ppl who deferred NS tho,btohqsg
nahh sokay i mean if mindef want me to serve i will still go,btohqsg
i mean its not a choice la,btohqsg
can resume studies once you come back?,btohqsg
People who go to med school get to defer to go to Uni,btohqsg
Does Uni even allow you to LOA 2 years?,btohqsg
also  how difficult is it to get into tsinghua uni,btohqsg
Cause SAF wants them to serve as medical officers,btohqsg
yes  there are oso cases where IS become PR and have to serve NS then come back continuing study,btohqsg
I think I should be able to survive the chinese there,btohqsg
oh there is a website on A level results or equivalent for entering tsinghua i saw somewhere,btohqsg
yeah but i cant rmb exactly which website,btohqsg
it is better for u to just inquire from the official website itself,btohqsg
they only said outstanding results la,btohqsg
but my results ain't THAT outstanding either,btohqsg
Full A for core subjects is probably what they mean,btohqsg
is PW and GP considered core,btohqsg
Only SG cares about GP PW,btohqsg
China uni fees are cheap man,btohqsg
tsinghua uni actually not that hard,btohqsg
should be fairly achievable to enter,btohqsg
maybe cos my sch got MOU,btohqsg
tsinghua is insane hard for locals but easier for international iirc,btohqsg
someone with 70+ rp went there to pursue med,btohqsg
I think I'm taking HSK next year,btohqsg
source : word of mouth from cousins,btohqsg
are u exempted from chinese a lvls,btohqsg
ya i think need take HSK for china unis,btohqsg
so is ntu and nus but not that hard to go in oso,btohqsg
oh then u might have to take hsk,btohqsg
later some weird disease pop up again,btohqsg
My parents wanted to send me to wuhan uni,btohqsg
for ppl who did not achieve a in a lvl chinese or exempted,btohqsg
oh I got A for A level chinese,btohqsg
oh then its fine for u :D,btohqsg
so much for rejecting HCL during sec 1,btohqsg
my sch highly encouraged ppl to take HSK,btohqsg
They suggested sending me to Wuhan  and the next thing I know  Wuhan sent the coronavirus,btohqsg
cuz i have a china based family,btohqsg
then they got one kid in tsinghua,btohqsg
everyday come and show off to my mom,btohqsg
tiagong pursue degree in China  opportunities limited to China unless got connexions. tiagong only  dont @ me if wrong,btohqsg
need to research on that further,btohqsg
well if u cant get into ivy league,btohqsg
I confirm can't ivy league lmao,btohqsg
u can always get into the 10 times cheaper version of them  in China,btohqsg
but then i realised not worth it,btohqsg
whaat course u planning to do in tsinghua tho,btohqsg
You? China? I find it hard to believe man,btohqsg
ah maybe better to do that in china than sg,btohqsg
wait what you're willing to learn med terms in CL?,btohqsg
@idefinitelydidnotseeyou want to study in China?,btohqsg
That's what I told them too,btohqsg
same but looking at chinese characters still gimme headache,btohqsg
no but the point is after learning it in Chinese  do you know the Eng counterpart to practice in SG,btohqsg
that's why it's up to the uni,btohqsg
I doubt it‚Äôs that big a deal,btohqsg
because it's q important to bridge connections between the English countries and China,btohqsg
plus they offer modules in English as well,btohqsg
@idefinitelydidnotseeif you're confident in your chinese,btohqsg
actll if ure familiar with the terms a lot are just transliteration,btohqsg
The 21st century is supposedly the rule of Asia,btohqsg
I like Chinese too but technical terms in CL is a hard no for me  have you seen the CL periodic table? HAHA OMG I was like,btohqsg
Thats why staying local isnt bad,btohqsg
glad that i found my  fellow wumao heree,btohqsg
Took me 15 seconds to read each word,btohqsg
I do wish I was better at Chinese,btohqsg
I'm not putting in the effort to get better at it,btohqsg
R u brother of Chee chong?,btohqsg
this pic gives me the shivers,btohqsg
Isn't there like a bottom part,btohqsg
Was that actually a legit Qn? LOL,btohqsg
thats not even a qn she is just acting cute,btohqsg
bayberry you don't have to know,btohqsg
Yes I know someine call Chee chong,btohqsg
nope i do not have a brother called chee chong,btohqsg
no i cringe whenever i see Âò§Âò§Âò§,btohqsg
haven't heard of such an expression before,btohqsg
its just a sound u make when u cry but cuter,btohqsg
Did u just cringe at urself Âò§Âò§Âò§,btohqsg
(I totally knew how to read that),btohqsg
I draw energy from being alone with friends,btohqsg
how do u be alone with friends?,btohqsg
All your friends are talking to each other and you‚Äôre just being silent,btohqsg
be with friends in a quiet place,btohqsg
I like being around with friends,btohqsg
sounds like me in most scenarios,btohqsg
But half the time I just enjoy being with them too,btohqsg
dont sugarcoat  the word is wallpaper,btohqsg
im just saying paper sounds a lot more plain than flower XD,btohqsg
He looks like a Lil tomato when he blush,btohqsg
There's no fifth amendment in Singapore,btohqsg
You'll be charged for breaching SHN,btohqsg
Ehh nvm I shouldn't talk about saf stuff anyway,btohqsg
If I‚Äôve an SHN I‚Äôve not been informed,btohqsg
Why would I go to spoiler land while I‚Äôm watching it,btohqsg
haha great i just wanted to confirm,btohqsg
You're in for a treat once you're done,btohqsg
And ppl are trying to convince me to attend church stuff again,btohqsg
Another person invited me to their church online service,btohqsg
why are you in somebody's invite to church for easter list lol,btohqsg
I suppose they wouldn‚Äôt put churchgoers on the list of people to invite to church,btohqsg
They'll probably invite people from other church to,btohqsg
is it possible to achieve such levels of comedy,btohqsg
did john just called us non-admins,btohqsg
I mean  valued members of the SGExams Chat Group,btohqsg
As valuable as stuff you can get from Valu$?,btohqsg
And I'm pretty sure Valu$ isn't open,btohqsg
Your value cannot be put in monetary terms,btohqsg
I'll vote for you when you run for elections John Smith,btohqsg
Good thing I still have some in stock,btohqsg
Assuming that I will take power democratically,btohqsg
I dont know your name oops,btohqsg
You can't vote for someone you don't know the look of,btohqsg

Sorry!I don't understand what you mean.  what is Mutti ?,btohqsg
Nevermind  what are your views about Angela Merkel?,btohqsg
Conversing with Singaporean teenagers is a horrible way to improve English tbh,btohqsg
you might want to refrain from short-forms when addressing language learners haha,btohqsg
she is the best politician.  very kind and intelegent woman.I love Angela Merkel,btohqsg
whut lermao yu meen teenz aren't da besto besto et eigo???,btohqsg
intelligent*Anyway  as the rest have pointed out  this group comprises of mostly Singaporean teenagers  who mostly use Singlish  kind of an English creole so to speak  not exactly standard English  so it might not be the best place for you to learn proper English. Nevertheless  you are welcome to stay if you wish.,btohqsg
