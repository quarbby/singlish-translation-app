Hahaha. Promotion period starts on day 1 of the month liao.*UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion (“Promotion”) is valid from 1 April 2024 to 29 June 2024  both dates inclusive (“Promotion Period”),btohqsg
New clause.Anyhow  next month maybe UOB add more T&C then everyone BBQ liao 😂,btohqsg

Hihi  I checked milelion but just wanna double cfm if I am correct.Can I still earn 4mpd if I use UOB preferred platinum cc for medical bills by pay wave via Google pay?,btohqsg
Ya… my final finally understanding is that those people who withdraw last day of 30 May is safe only.Lose 1 days interest but safe.Those who withdraw on 1 June is also not safe because they withdrew from existing UOB accounts.This guy who write this 3rd clause is a genius sia. 😂😂😂30 days before promo start 1 July is also means the whole 30 days of June month  cannot withdraw.Ha….,btohqsg
WLWLWLBBQLCan only go UOB ask liao when 1st July dropping chicken come out liao. 🤣,btohqsg
Just a gentle reminder.Elite miles earn on ground . Will be until tomorrow last day.,btohqsg
Previously I ask here about hsbc 1 travel card annual fee . On 31th May . They charged me 180,btohqsg
Means spending on merchants from kris pay . Elite miles earning on ground will be until 4th june,btohqsg
"If someone transfer from UOB  savings account say $51k to an external bank  registered ""One Account"" for the promo and transfer $50k in from an external bank. By definition from the clause 1.6 (III)  it wouldnt qualify  but how is UOB able to detect? Unless they are doing a total MAB across all your accounts as comparison. That would be alot of investigating work.",btohqsg
Applied SC card from singsaver since dec and fulfilled all the conditions but yet to receive the $300 or so .. Is it normal to wait for so long,btohqsg

For arranging giro credit card payment via EGA  do I need to inform HSBC before submitting the forms at the various credit card banks?,btohqsg
The clauses are written in such a way it can interpret widely and to the bank advantage. Do as much hoops as possible so it is not easy to pick up. Now with AI advancing  such behaviors or patterns can be pick up Ex: Transfer out and transfer in from the same external bank is a red flag  transfer in/transfer out of big amounts only in the months when promotion going to kick off is a red flag.  The bank wont tell what is their algorithm to detect such,btohqsg
Bros. How about those under hdb flats private clinic.  Does citi rewards card qualify 4 miles ?,btohqsg
Need to see under what mcc. Private should be yes?Cuz i always pay using my amaze+crcm TCM,btohqsg
On a worrisome note  dont be surprised if they decide to change the clauses for the salary fast in method. But I will put that less likely as I believed many people including myself deposit money into UOB because of this method.,btohqsg
Its true. AI can help. Have to invent some exception scenarios... like to transfer from UOB to Bank A  then Bank A to B and then from Bank B using a spouse or family member's account back to UOB again! 😂,btohqsg
That is a good mention. The clauses also never mention the names of the accounts specifically whether must be the same person. Of course  that depends if UOB has your family member names and their relationship and then they can track between external bank and between UOB accounts of the family members.  Especially if you use the person A and B method. In short  we need to be prepared if one days all these nerfs and AI detection comes in. Just enjoy while it last.,btohqsg
I am sure they already knew. Its a matter of whether they want to shut it down. Which means turning away customers and shoveling them towards competitors.,btohqsg
Agreed. My view is they may not want to close salary FAST loop hole as this bring customers to deposit new funds into UOB. But for promotions where people use existing funds  that is where they may tighten the criteria.,btohqsg
Thanks. But I think need to submit signature as opening account was online?,btohqsg
Ya need to go to hsbc branch to provide signature,btohqsg
Hi  intending to sign for chan bro(travel) tour package (10k+ transaction).If I use Amaz+citi rewards   do I still get 4mpd?Or not rewarding as my transaction still under travel category?,btohqsg

It’s ok. I not hard up for Uob promo. I still have Hsbc EGAs.,btohqsg
30 days before promo period is the killer. Thanks Mx for highlighted. I would have been caught off guard too,btohqsg
Means those who moved out on 1st Jun cannot take part in whatever new chicken promo ah?,btohqsg
Topup only on 2nd July if u moved out on 1st June. Higher amount. $155 010.,btohqsg
Bank count by dayend balance right. If withdraw till 1000 on 1 jun then can ah. 1 to 30jun consider 30 day? 1 jul is the 31st day?,btohqsg
