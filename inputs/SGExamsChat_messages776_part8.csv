its a very important concept to learn,btohqsg
Good fucking bye I'm gonna be bbqed during june,btohqsg
yes i call it CUM cuz circular urban metabolism is too long of a sentence to type,btohqsg
Wah finally this bot slip thru,btohqsg
But honestly I just rmb as a side bar info,btohqsg
I feel it's nvr rly tested,btohqsg
its a very central concept in waste management actually,btohqsg
The whole idea of urban sustainability and balance revolves around CUM,btohqsg
@IcedMilogive this bot a medal for getting thru,btohqsg
But I rmb she spent more time yapping abt circular,btohqsg
"""Demand placed on natural environments when waste is not viewed as a potential resource""",btohqsg
Linear is the reason why got alot of waste what,btohqsg
Out of context this is errr very interesting,btohqsg
idk if they tell u this,btohqsg
Ok nvm focus on cc first,btohqsg
but in ej they keep telling us,btohqsg
sustainable urban development is the imbalance between the needs of poeple and the potential of a city,btohqsg
or some fk shit like that,btohqsg
Pls tell me that's a mnemonic,btohqsg
When I went to uni I learnt about sponge cities,btohqsg
they taught us that for flooding,btohqsg
its cause its not explicitly required by the geog syllabus,btohqsg
i never bothered to properly learn abt it,btohqsg
cuz it was so inconsequential in the context of flooding,btohqsg
and also cause i just hated writing essays abt flooding,btohqsg
Sometimes it's about efficient space utilisation,btohqsg
Flooding actually is a rare thing and technically just make sure your pipped supply is still present can liao,btohqsg
Tldr both shld coexist tgtAdaptation for short termMitigation long term,btohqsg
okay so normally the way I always write,btohqsg
It's infrastructure + geography which is more fun imo,btohqsg
BP1: Mitigation > Adaptation (Because global strategy it allows like codependence  can help to negate localised conditions)Talk abt Kyoto/COPs/REDD+BP2: Mitigation > Adaptation because mitigation directly deals with the root causes of climate change but adaptation deals more indirectlyTalk abt Carbon Capture/ReforestationBP3: Adaptation is still needed as a short-term response to the immediate effects experienced by countries,btohqsg
Like these are normally my points?,btohqsg
I have my essay for it if uw,btohqsg
1 plate of chicken rice plus egg,btohqsg
Not for actual As tho ofc,btohqsg
u physically cannot get C for geog,btohqsg
there is no C in geography,btohqsg
U either get A or E,btohqsg
dk anyone who gets a U for geog,btohqsg
but my last year i had one student,btohqsg
got consistent 20 in the entirety of her sch,btohqsg
Prolly just not give any fuck,btohqsg
I got an ABSENT grade before,btohqsg
then she got B in the end,btohqsg
like she never got more than 1/20 for her essays,btohqsg
Her prelims i think she got,btohqsg
But thats cause she got 24/32 for one of the essay sets,btohqsg
Lena alw yap abt it being actually hard to get like,btohqsg
u write a completely different qn,btohqsg
If U actually try I mean,btohqsg
