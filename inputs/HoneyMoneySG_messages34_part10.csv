In all honesty  grab mastercard is the worst card I own... never in my life have a seen a  card with the mastercard logo on it  but even if the merchant excepts mastercard  the card won't work because grab has some issue with the merchant.. it's so freakin' annoying to keep track of which merchants work and which doesn't.,btohqsg

These refer to Qualifying Charges made via the internet ormobile applications  which is determined by system indicators reflecting that it is anonline transaction and which are processed by the respective merchants/acquirers asan online transaction through Visa/Mastercard networks. These indicators are decidedby the relevant merchant and/or their acquirer and are not determined by Citibank.,btohqsg

Can top up into Instarem wallet and earn points?,btohqsg
Sorry this say this but fuxk this Kris+ app. When I go to their website they only have a list of 2-3 partners. Then when I go to NTUC finest to attempt to pay using this sucky app no one has heard of it,btohqsg
It is not a credit card and you can pay online yet it is also not net so you can't use qr code. Seriously trust SQ to come up with some half baked shitty payment app,btohqsg
Is is par for the course for their incompetence,btohqsg
"Ever since their ""new"" revamped website everything has turned to shit",btohqsg
Anyway I have deleted that shit app. I stay far west and have no interest in going down to changi airport to attempt to explore ways to use this shit app,btohqsg
pay at ntuc finest service counter. quite a few merchants ah  how u search?,btohqsg
The staff never heard of it,btohqsg
Half baked marketed apps piss me off,btohqsg
I sign up with promo code also got 0 credit...dunno why I bothered,btohqsg
Last time this Amex also quite good 1,btohqsg
Hi Sir  Adam just said canBut take note  this is only on UOB Abs CB,btohqsg
its either that or nothing... Your choice,btohqsg
Actually Amex wrong move if u ask me,btohqsg
Becos Amex hardly accept everywhere selected place onlyIf right back with grab card at least got paynow can use,btohqsg
I dont see why this is a wrong move. They are not earning/learning anything from us topping up to grabpay,btohqsg
At least got ppl use the card?Isn’t bank all like ppl to use the card if not they cannot benefit from it?,btohqsg
Well so far at places i shop at all accept Amex. so where do you shop that does not accept amex?,btohqsg
yep they want people to use the card but they are not earning the spending data from us. There are alot of things in the background that we do not know. Just because it becomes an inconvenience to the user does not mean the company did a wrong move.Either way this was predicted way before,btohqsg
