Depends on your spending. Pick something that can contribute to your spending for UOB one account. Check out t&c for the list of cards eligible.,btohqsg

600 min spend (300 online & 300 mobile)  6.67% effective cashback  about $40/monthVSNo min spend  1.7% cashback  less restrictions on categories,btohqsg
UOB Absolute don't contribute to spend. Remember to check the t&cs.,btohqsg
To track  use Excel or Sheets.To check  quarterly login to UOB TMRW to see  provided you're eligible to get,btohqsg
Yes  I'm pretty sure i did that,btohqsg

Got it  thanks a bunch üôÇ,btohqsg
Transfer to another bank was done on 29 Dec coz I kiasu. 31 Dec ending balance is 3.83 coz that is the base interest credited on 31 Dec,btohqsg
Jan 24 statement  also more than 100k throughout.,btohqsg
I supposed you also received the registration email.. and you didn't go below 100003.83 at any point of time from 31 Jan onwards?,btohqsg
Register in January. Earmark only happens end Feb.,btohqsg
Ya.. so usually from 31 Jan till earmark should not fall below 100k + 31 Dec balance ma.,btohqsg
OP said early Feb no reaction then he go register again,btohqsg
Haha maybe because he Feb registered again then UOB erased his Jan registration? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI remembered they said don't send multiple registrations.,btohqsg
Based on last action.  Deposit date or form submission date. Whichever later,btohqsg
Just in case  I didn't put enough money to my UOB acc to be earmarked and received this sms message. I put more money and it got earmarked in a week. I think you should call UOB customer serviceDear customer  we note that your account registered in the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion has not been funded with the participating deposit amount stated in your registration form. Please be reminded to top up your account by 30 March 2024 to qualify for this promotion. Visit Promotions > Save on the official UOB Personal Banking website to find out more. Insured up to S$75k by SDIC.,btohqsg
U submit in feb. Earmark becomes end March,btohqsg
@YSLee_sgdid you receive this SMS? I suspect you keep on submit new registration and it got overwritten lol,btohqsg
Did your daily balance fall below $100 003.83 inany dayin Mar 2024?  Do you have any GIRO deduction from your UOB One account in Mar?,btohqsg
Oh  I just checked. For a few days in mid Feb  the balance was 100k exact . So if this is the cause  then i should have kept min 100 003.83. funny thing is then I top up to above that amount but maybe too late,btohqsg
Thanks. But I didn't receive this SMS,btohqsg
uob absolute cannot contribute to interest tracker,btohqsg
You have 2 choices:1. Transfer inNOW(I just checked  still today's date) to make your account exactly 100003.83  keep until earmark happens  do not withdraw anything even if the interest comes in (to be safe). Register for March participation periodNOW(today last day)  do not re-register anymore  check for registration email.2. Transfer out everything to another bankNOW  and hope that they announce the next promo on Monday.,btohqsg
Thanks. I will go for option 2 since i had already emptied it on Thu. It's ok  just forgo the dragon promo. Appreciate all your helpüëç,btohqsg
Just don't touch the monies after you transfer in. If you're going for this promo  your UOB One shouldn't be your primary account for any funds transfers anyway.,btohqsg
Another example of just in time or touching the account after registering. That messes up the promo.Just play safe. And everything will be ok.Step 1 - make sure account only has $10 ideally 1-2 days before end of the monthStep 2 - register for the promo the moment it is announcedStep 3 - move in $100 000.00 immediately after registering. Don‚Äôt even touch the original $10 and any base or bonus interest. So u have 100 010.00 + any interest credited.Step 4 - do not touch the account. Don‚Äôt move in or out any single dollar until earmarked happens.If u follow the above. Everything will be fine. Don‚Äôt go and last minute or disturb the account.,btohqsg
