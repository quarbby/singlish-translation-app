WOOOHOOOO HEAVEN  is what i wld like to day,btohqsg
but i got another HY at my home,btohqsg
nahh man i ain't the type to get a tatoo,btohqsg
It‚Äôs Sunday  help me decide. Should I study or play,btohqsg
don‚Äôt have to study but do something productive pls,btohqsg
Gym? I hardly even go out,btohqsg
walk to singpost for lunch and walk back,btohqsg
yea man I have to start working on  my projects rn,btohqsg
wait u got sch this coming week ?,btohqsg
ohh tot is grad week for all polys,btohqsg
oh mine whole week no sch,btohqsg
yea man my fren all waiting,btohqsg
When is the next batch of enlistees gonna enter,btohqsg
when you finally find time to gym,btohqsg
It‚Äôs improving just not fast enough,btohqsg
Honestly I don‚Äôt really see the purpose of going to the gym is what My mindset is,btohqsg
then study more so it improves faster,btohqsg
If I can‚Äôt find a purpose  very unlikely I will do it,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why my studies so cui,btohqsg
Cause I never found a legit purpose in sec school to study  so I literally never did notes or anything,btohqsg
how am I motivated and unmotivated at the same time,btohqsg
tf is echinoderms doing on my p3 sister spelling list,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even feel motivated enough to leave my house and buy food,btohqsg
Why does she need to know these words at that level tho,btohqsg
see.. at this age I‚Äôm alr testing her all these.. Wah gg my children in the future..,btohqsg
Somehow I scored better for my chi spelling than Eng,btohqsg
Fuck I‚Äôm too lazy to leave my house and buy food lmao,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs see if any poly peeps know what this is,btohqsg
how do your hands work  i tried writing and it failed,btohqsg
Normal lah  everytime my bro got spelling also testing him,btohqsg
no den i scold her for other work üò¨üò¨,btohqsg
I mean looking at my handwriting I also did not want to write,btohqsg
For my brother it‚Äôs me and my mother scolding him,btohqsg
He said Chinese is useless  so why should I learn,btohqsg
Then my mother is stubborn ar throwing money into Chinese tuition for him,btohqsg
Then reply him ‚Äúyou also useless  but we still kept you‚Äù,btohqsg
It may look redundant now  but when China rises up in the future,btohqsg
We will lose out a lot,btohqsg
Then bro went to fact check me and say‚Ä¶.no Uni/poly require you to pass Chinese,btohqsg
He aint wrong in that sense,btohqsg
The problem is he is in clb,btohqsg
But it really seems that hes making a stupid choice lol,btohqsg
wah honestly i think clb is a waste of time  either u take Chinese or drop,btohqsg
He is in express but the school specially made a arrangement for him to take clb,btohqsg
my teacher was telling us who want to drop to clb.. thank god i had trust in myself and got B ü´°ü´°,btohqsg
But yea  who cares anyways. Everyone thinks Chinese is useless. Honestly its kinda sad,btohqsg
for context: F9 since sec 1,btohqsg
