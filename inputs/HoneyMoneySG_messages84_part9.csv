Just want to confirm EVERYONE can top up their medisave in Jan 2024 to reach $71 500 in order to enjoy tax relief of up to $8k.Even people with FRS and ERS?,btohqsg
For UOB one card  how do I hit 7.8% ? I did spent $500 in a month n credit my salary and have 100k in my account. But I only got about 5% monthly,btohqsg
Are you referring to the UOB one account? 7.8% is only for the 25k between 75k and 100k,btohqsg
So the EIR on total of 100k deposit is 5%,btohqsg
How do I maximise to 7.8%?,btohqsg
The EIR for the UOB One account can never be 7.8%  it's not possible. Best you can possibly do is 6.x% by stacking with UOB earmark promo,btohqsg
Oh I see  then why did they even advertise 7.8% when is not possible? I thought I did not hit one of their criteria for to hit the max of 7.8%,btohqsg
Advertising? But pls read T&Cs of things  don't just look at the headline,btohqsg
As he said  this is what he meant.,btohqsg
Is that why inflation rate is so high? Cos a lot of people take advantage of high sums of money and interest to drive up demand for goods and services demand push inflation + cost push inflation of raw materials and ingredients stemming from the 2 wars,btohqsg
It's because fed printed too much money,btohqsg

also  how can I set up recurring transfer for Salary payment to UOB account to fulfil the $1.6k criteria,btohqsg
Depends on what is your purpose of top up. If for medical needs  MA. If for parents monthly payout  RA. Either way  this top up there is no lump sum withdrawal.,btohqsg
How to check if there's still lendlease referral? 😊️️ I don't seem to get the $20 after inputting the referral. Has the 5k redemption ran out?,btohqsg
UOB ibanking can set recurring transfer in FASTDBS need to set up Standing Instructions via Pay/Transfer section > More,btohqsg
SIA eligible for 3 miles/$ on uob krisflyer?,btohqsg

In dbs standing instruction cant put salary category and also cant seem to specify the SRS acct for transfer,btohqsg
If cannot then use manual effort  set monthly alarm/meeting,btohqsg
UOB automatically deduct annual fee from UNI$ balance without warning… Although still waivable🤣,btohqsg
This mechanism is written in their tnc regarding annual fees,btohqsg
Haha yeah just a bit counter intuitive,btohqsg
They hope it would go unnoticed by regular users,btohqsg
Maybe grabpay master (topup with your UOB absolute)  only 0.3% tho,btohqsg

Hi  can citi cashback+ earn cashback for insurance payment?,btohqsg
Hi  what card should i use for dining and drinks at ce la vi? I have instarem+ citi reward miles  hsbc revolution and advance,btohqsg
No  insurance payments do not count towards the $800 monthly minimum spending required for cashback  nor do they qualify for any cashback.,btohqsg
I guess this is really up to you and which card you need to hit minimum spending for? Instarem+Citi rewards is 4 mpd  HSBC revolution also same at 4mpd if you pay contactless via mobile  HSBC advance is just 1.5% cashback or 2.5% if you spend over $2000 in a month... so really up to you,btohqsg
Sometimes don't just trust advertisement as it is. Details are more important,btohqsg
Anyone used Momo 5.8% guranteed return ? Seems safe for 1 month ( recently 2 months),btohqsg
If I remember correctly  it's better to redeem cashback for Revolution as need to pay annual fee for miles.,btohqsg
hm  dun think just a bit more fee affect the decision to convert to miles or cashback,btohqsg

UserZXhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no referral codes,btohqsg

HSBC you just need to pay $47(?) conversion fee and convert all points into partner airline miles  Revolution is annual fee-less,btohqsg
