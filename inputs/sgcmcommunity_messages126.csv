Defamation is if I state none factual items to ruin his reputation but I did not. Actually I still have his voice recording asking me to go ahead.,btohqsg

Non-stop rain erodes SG roads causing 'bumper and undercarriage deadly potholes' to appearMore road potholes 🕳 spotted around Singapore 🇸🇬 after days of continuous downpour 🌧  resulting in imbalance of roads 🛣 and bumpy vehicles 🚖.Googled: Because of prolonged rain ☔️  a larger amount of water 💧 seeps into cracks on road pavements. Continuous movement of vehicles causes the water to seep deeper 🪔 into the cracks  causing the cracks to widen 😮 and eventually forming potholes 🕳🕳🕳Read the full article here 🔽http://bit.ly/3JiJOXH,btohqsg
I reported one within 3 days fix,btohqsg
keep Kena potholes these days... heart pain,btohqsg

Is Lancer a better option than a civic?,btohqsg
if u ask me civic is ultimate haha,btohqsg
No  in fact you should buy a blue civic,btohqsg
But scirocco got bad rep but people are still buying it.,btohqsg
There's a very nice unit on the market that I saw,btohqsg
I agree with a bit of what Pete said,btohqsg
Some peopl smoke to feel other things leh,btohqsg
To numb the pain in their heart,btohqsg
Why is the civic the superior choice?,btohqsg
Tend to be more reliable and a better platform,btohqsg
I personally don't particularly fancy either one but if you made me choose  I'd take the civic,btohqsg
And I'm not saying I don't recommend civics or lancers,btohqsg
If it's what you want go for it,btohqsg
Personally  I just don't see the hype.,btohqsg
I'd rather work and be able to buy the cars I want,btohqsg
No budget  for now but they look nice.,btohqsg
Just like those law breakers  no licence still drive,btohqsg
But my wallet thinking of Gb and MU problems,btohqsg
Honestly i wud go for civic cus it looks nicer,btohqsg
Provided u dun hav other stuff to pay/ to save up for,btohqsg
You should get a blue civic,btohqsg
Well  that's when you work more,btohqsg
I meant work hard enough to afford what you want,btohqsg
Just test drive and choose whichever feels nicer to drive,btohqsg
If money is not an issue,btohqsg
Don't bother to look at OMV  it's a stupid metric,btohqsg
Higher OMV does not equals better to drive,btohqsg
Is it accurate to group it like that?,btohqsg
essentially  the price initial cost less all watever taxes we slapped on top of it,btohqsg
Expensive means more high class… anyway cars are function of $$,btohqsg
Especially in this day and age,btohqsg
Cars are a mix of different factors and features and one needs to see what they like and want and choose based on that,btohqsg
Then what is cheap and feels “higher class” than a more expensive car?,btohqsg
A good kia/Hyundai feels much better than a w205 c class,btohqsg
You can go sit in both yourself,btohqsg
I totally agree with you on this!!!!,btohqsg
some korean cars really put the contis to shame,btohqsg
e.g ventilated seats and rear aircon vents ( WHICH SHUD BE BASIC),btohqsg
But pple will still want to buy the  Mercedes!!,btohqsg
mercedes still has a better driving performance,btohqsg
Similarly  an ioniq 5 feels much better compared to a standard range model 3,btohqsg
Cla180s give you a Nissan 1.3,btohqsg
And the previous gen gave you a Renault megane 1.6,btohqsg
But you slap a Merc badge on,btohqsg
i like the KIA GT Line tho,btohqsg
If you're after the 2 screens,btohqsg
i wasnt referring to cla180 tho,btohqsg
didnt even pop into my head,btohqsg
What were you referring to then,btohqsg
im not really a fan of cross over/ suvs tho,btohqsg
Oops  I tend to put them in together,btohqsg
Since they're essentially the same car  barring interior and body differences,btohqsg
technically speaking if we go see the org chart,btohqsg
it gets messy when u actually look at it,btohqsg
does Hyundai owns KIA or KIA owns Hyundai?,btohqsg
Why do people buy entry level mercs/bmw?,btohqsg
some people buy for the badge  but some just wanna try it out,btohqsg
Wouldn’t it be a better choice to buy some other cars with practically the same power?,btohqsg
can i just say a car performance is not just about its engine or how fast issit,btohqsg
like rims  steering  handling. some car makers just does it better,btohqsg
Then why would one buy a car?,btohqsg
but when u got multiple small kids or elderly parents,btohqsg
a car is useful in ferrying ppl around,btohqsg
at your pace  at your time at your leisure,btohqsg
Bus would be a better choice.,btohqsg
ur startinig to sound like pete,btohqsg
Which is why I put them together,btohqsg
I won’t fetch people. If they want  they will have to pay for petrol,btohqsg
Also  I am my own person.,btohqsg

I clean my rickshaw until so clean I kiss it too every night,btohqsg
Come we clean your new palisade together,btohqsg
I kiss the shiny handle and giant chrome grill after that,btohqsg

If small  try those touch up paint. They are similar to nail paint. 😅,btohqsg
Wah all wake up so early,btohqsg
Why do people complain about global warming but still buy petrol car?,btohqsg
Producing electric car = contribute to global warming too :(,btohqsg
But is it not a better choice?,btohqsg
All the carbon monoxide produced by modified cars contributing to the global warming.,btohqsg
How U think electricity is generated,btohqsg
Battery but battery can be recycled.,btohqsg
Hmmm subjective  if more cars are electric  means our station needs to produce more power  more power = more coals etc used  back to square one IMO,btohqsg
I think the only way that works if they improve the battery tech (not likely will happen anytime soon),btohqsg
But why does the government approve EVs and making it a “EV only” country?,btohqsg
EV only would be a bad move. Some hybrid are really good and efficient,btohqsg
You sure about this? Most ev batteries die after 6 to 8 years and disposal is a nightmare,btohqsg
maybe gov want to eliminate high demand of petrol in the country,btohqsg
And shift demand to coal to produce electricity?,btohqsg
Mining ⛏️ the Lithium for Lithium 🔋 causes alot of pollution than ICE.https://youtu.be/VzrNgJg-25sWhy go hybrid? Because don't wanna be a slave  OPEC petrol price😅Look at Germany  LL still needs to buy some Russian Oil and Gas.So  Europe is looking into Hydrogen Fuel Cell Cars.BMW has iX5 Hydrogen,btohqsg
I don't have too much experience with them,btohqsg
But they tend to be slightly cleaner compared to the 1.4s,btohqsg
Oh as in lesser mods ah,btohqsg
I was thinking 1.2 but my friend said the gb might not be able to take if i tune the car up,btohqsg
I read that can hire drivers by the hour in KL  either with grab or private one  anyone know what is the cost?,btohqsg
Going there for one day biz trip tmr,btohqsg
Try carousell n Facebook. They advertise there,btohqsg
Book one using the app and then text them directly,btohqsg
You'll probably get a better rate because there's no cut for grab involved,btohqsg
Just need to cancel the booking later,btohqsg

Quote from outside articles:-There are differences in three items: the emissions in the use phase (by far the largest item in the case of the combustion engine)  the production and supply chain of raw materials and  in the case of the electric cars  battery production. Volvo puts the latter at around 4-5 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle.If you add up the individual items that occur until the car is handed over to the customer  the CO2 emissions of the C40 Recharge (and the all-electric XC40) are around 70 per cent higher than those of the combustion model. The big difference is in the use phase – calculated at 200 000 kilometres.To fully exploit the potential of electric cars  Volvo Cars is therefore calling for more investment in clean energy. “We need green power throughout the supply chain and production  not just in the use phase when charging ” says Otterheim.,btohqsg
