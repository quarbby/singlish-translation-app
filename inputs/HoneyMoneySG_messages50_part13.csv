Is it free to do fast transfer from DBS to HSBC?,btohqsg
Amaze card converts overseas spend to local online spend. No overseas bonus points/cashback on the linked card. But u do earn instapoint (equivalent to 1% cashback) and the points/cashback on the linked card for local spend. No foreign currency fees on Amaze but there is about 2% markup over the mastercard exchange rate. HSBC and citibank cards charge 3%-3.25% foreign currency exchange fees for overseas spend.,btohqsg

Hi guys! I just applied for the HSBC EGA recently  and did FAST transfers of $1x5 out of the account on 1st of the mth. Why do they only send out the eligibility sms like on 10th of the mth?? I was thinking of GIRO-ing my tax bills to the account  but seems like it might completely miss the spend period leh. IS anyone else experiencing the same thing?,btohqsg
1)Card applied 1st june2)Card approved 7 june3)Card activated 12 june4)Request for billing cycle to changed from 23june-23 July to 30may-30june.,btohqsg
(4) can only verify again on 24  june like that. Don‚Äôt know in the app or estatement got any way to verify billing cycle date and the active quarter of the statement. Where can find billing cycle info?,btohqsg
Should I call and verify again how is the quarter calculated. I thought the quarter is standardA)jan to marchB)April to juneC)July to septD)oct to DecCan be otherwise meh?,btohqsg
i‚Äôve opened my uob one account months ago and ‚Äúvacated‚Äù my ocbc 360 account except for the minimum balance required in the account. is there a reason to keep that account? am thinking of closing it off.. am only aware maybe i could withdraw money from ocbc thru mobile app if i‚Äôm still a customer. other than that i don‚Äôt have any use for an ocbc account now. üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Of course. That is calendar quarter  it is not the 'statement quarter' that UOB uses. For your case  pretty sure June is your first month and your quarter should be June-July-Aug. But you should call in and verify with CSO when is your quarter's start date..,btohqsg
Omg that‚Äôs so messy. I need to call again. Thanks for saving me. üò≠,btohqsg
Np. UOB uses 'statement month' and 'statement quarter'  while there are other banks use calendar month and calendar quarter to calculate cashback. Eg. Maybank.,btohqsg
5% for 100k? don‚Äôt think so.. unless u add invest/insure in ocbc.,btohqsg
Can we request uob to change our credit card to follow calendar months instead of statement month ?,btohqsg
How we can do that ?Through phone call ?,btohqsg
You can request to change your which date ur statement month ends at. But don't think can change quarter. Say June is ur first month in a quarter  and u request to change to July as ur first month in the statement. What will happen to your spendings in June? They are not in any of the quarters..,btohqsg
Can i check can i withdraw my funds in my EGA account after the promotion period is over (before receiving my bonus interest)? Or I have to leave it status quo  till interest is credited 2 months later?,btohqsg

U can withdraw leaving minimum balance to reset ADB for 1 month,btohqsg
should withdraw everything on 1st of the month after the promo period,btohqsg
