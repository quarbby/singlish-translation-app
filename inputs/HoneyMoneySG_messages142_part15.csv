I do most of my bookings on Expedia,btohqsg
I used to love Agoda deep deep but was very disappointed when I did a booking for Marriott. Marriott counter staff told me that there are some trade off on Agoda for pricing it the cheapest. From then on  I read the fine prints carefully on Agoda.,btohqsg
What tradeoffs? Usually Marriott will be willing to price match. You could get member benefits too,btohqsg

Hi a car company in UK is planning to refund me on my transactions with them and its like a large amount  around 2k GBP.They have requested for my bank details such as:Beneficiary (Name of the account holder):Address of the account holder:Bank (Name of the Bank):Bank addressIBAN/ Account number:BIC/ SWIFT (sort code  routing nr):I'm wondering should i get the amount transfered to like my regular OCBC account or other platforms like Youtrip  Amaze or Big pay so that the conversion rate is not affected or I can convert in apps like Youtrip when the rates are better. Any advice ?,btohqsg
Do they accept refund to a card?,btohqsg
I have yet to check with them on this. So if its yes i can just get them to transfer to Youtrip ?,btohqsg
I'd personally use trust link card if you have. Refund to saving account.Other people using youtrip  can u transfer the money out?,btohqsg
Would love to know if anyone has experience with waiving annual fee for 2nd year of HSBC TravelOne! 🙏,btohqsg
Oh i dont have trust link card. Also it will follow the bank conversion rate right ?,btohqsg
Will follow visa rate. Youtrip will follow master card rate,btohqsg
I see  will check with them if card is possible. But in the event if card is not possible. Do you think Amaze or Big pay would be a better option ?,btohqsg
Just work around it with dbs bill payment?,btohqsg
So there is no need to use amaze+crmc for kris+  am I right?,btohqsg
You can’t use CRMC directly in Kris+ because Citi exclude in-app payments from earning 10x. In order to by-pass that  have to pair with Amaze.,btohqsg
Dont forget to default amaze in gpay too,btohqsg
On this note  its more important that spending are within 1k of amaze calendar month? Even if crmc statement month is different?,btohqsg
Yup. Keep amaze within 1k to avoid 1% charge in a calender month.,btohqsg
ideally within Amaze 1k in calendar month and within crmc 1k in statement month  if can pay directly using crmc (online that is non mobile in-app or offline fashion) should do so,btohqsg
Which cryto platform to use in Singapore under MAS regulated,btohqsg
hihi anyone knows if altitude card is based on trx / posting date? tia! for the 5mpd,btohqsg
not true  read the relevant clause,btohqsg
16. The calculation of Minimum Spend Requirement and Eligible Spend is based on the transaction date of the retail spend charged to the Card Account.,btohqsg
If we pair CRMC and May Bank F&F cards with Amaze and pay by Amaze  how do we know which card the payment will be charged to? Thanks,btohqsg
u choose the card in instarem app  before making payment,btohqsg
For example  if I want to use Maybank F&F to pay instead of CRMC  I amend the “change source “in the Instarem app to Maybank F&F?,btohqsg
Hi guys  new to CCs. Citi jus called me and ask if want to do some installment-based payment for my new crmc.Any benefits of doing this  or should I just stick to normal monthly full payment?,btohqsg
Usually instalment will not give u any rewards.,btohqsg
Ah ic  so it's a trap 😅,btohqsg
are they asking you to take a loan?,btohqsg
I don't think so  mainly paying off credit in installments (they mentioned smth about credit limit etc),btohqsg
what's the best credit card to use for spending in JB?,btohqsg
Maybank fnf (up to 312.5) or trust card imo (for cashback),btohqsg
For investment platforms like webull and tiger  do their new users promo apply to those who closed their accounts before? Similar to cc promos?,btohqsg
It doesn't have a clause that says it excludes those who have cancelled an account within x months like cc.That's why i'm wondering if anyone is doing or has done this before,btohqsg
Would like to ask if bank saving is less than 50k  is it better to put them into moomoo instead to either UOB or OCBC 360?,btohqsg
If 50k is all u have  I'd suggest saving account.,btohqsg
Anyone tried transfer funds > 150k between same name acc from hsbc EGA to another acc without getting funds hold by the bank due to the new regulations?,btohqsg
Like to know too. Planning to transfer OCBC to HSBC for Dec.,btohqsg
So I use HSBC revolution via Kris+ at the Harvey Norman  I can earn 4MPD correct?,btohqsg

"Hi  has anyone tried the ""transfer points option"" for the Standard Chartered Journey card? Can you transfer down to the last points or only in 100k denomination?""You can now transfer 360° Rewards Points to your preferred nominee(S) whom holds a valid Standard Chartered Credit Card(s). A fee of S$10 will be charged for every 100 000 of 360° Rewards Points transferred to a nominee’s credit card account.
