I take engineering so english not really necessary,btohqsg
i mean you dont need to know literary devices la,btohqsg
As in no need to be top notched,btohqsg
but then i think need to like understand,btohqsg
omg someone ik said  she was deciding between pcmg and pcme but decided on pcme cause she think shes gonna need tuition for the humans subj and might as well take econs cause h2 econs tuition is more easy to find,btohqsg
and she doesnt rly have a preference,btohqsg
thats the dumbest shit ive heard this year other than ‚Äúsave palestine‚Äù,btohqsg
The year still early my guy,btohqsg
youll change ur words soon enough,btohqsg
U missed the dude that wanted to go mi,btohqsg
I am going to apply to MI. I heard that MI is only $6/month and has higher chance of going local uni. You also have 3 years to think about questions at a scenic pace and the cost in MI is less than in university because the MOE tuition subsidy only supports 4 years. If you prefer to extend to optimise results it is therefore less costly to do so in MI. You could also do this in JC if you retained or failed GP at the A level (and hence repeated J2).,btohqsg
@twosevenoffthe mi guy said the above in discord if you were wondering who he is,btohqsg
read a history book for once,btohqsg
why wld u have any sympathy for a race like themüò≠,btohqsg
ian do you consider urself to be involved or interested on sg politics,btohqsg
i dont want to be bc its really toxic,btohqsg
but more often than not i see things that piss me off and i tilt,btohqsg
alot of ppl my age dgaf about current affairs and stuff,btohqsg
and so i study more politics and philosophy to prove the idiots wrong,btohqsg
no way bruh the younger generation is all left and woke as hell,btohqsg
some ppl my age dont even know diff between president and prime minister of sg until teacher give a lesson,btohqsg
i thought thats one of the worst,btohqsg
They thought sg president have the power to pass bill.,btohqsg
all the idiot leftists i know are younger generations eh,btohqsg
i am y5 (jc 1)this year,btohqsg
maybe there is hope for humanity after all,btohqsg
oh btw today the class i was attached to  the class monitor said n word,btohqsg
Controversial but i feel like alot of ppl my age dont actl think about their own stance on a certain issue they js follow what is the popular viewpoint because they are afraid having a different opinion will cause them to become outcasted,btohqsg
btw this is not referring to a particular issue or current affair but a general trend,btohqsg
As a joke or uh lol,btohqsg
idk i just heard him say it lol,btohqsg
idk politics just made me feel that the average iq among the younger generation is depressingly low,btohqsg
some of these takes r absolutely retarded,btohqsg
supporting palestine and a terror group,btohqsg
needing to say pronouns in bio just to make 1-2% of the population happy,btohqsg
‚Äúbut palestine isnt hamas‚Äù ok then why did 86% of them vote for hamas,btohqsg
and look at what the palestinians did themselves,btohqsg
‚Äúthey dont have a state bc israel stole their land‚Äù ok then why did they reject a two state solution 3 times throughout history,btohqsg
bc their values say israel cannot exist,btohqsg
so a two state solution implies israel still exists and they cannot accept that in their religion,btohqsg
i avoid ppl with pronouns in bio like the plague,btohqsg
idc if theyre nice people if ure woke dont fking talk to me,btohqsg
isnt that like that painter guy,btohqsg
i swear palestine supporters are the dumbest bunch,btohqsg
science of language  mostly the spoken side like speech patterns etc  vs lit that‚Äôs more of analysing how people use their words in their world,btohqsg
oh AND as a singaporean if u support palestine ure especially stupid bc if not for israel we might be fucked,btohqsg
they helped us develop saf when we first became independent,btohqsg
so if u support palestine u abit,btohqsg
Wow damn that sounds so sophisticated,btohqsg
cb ppl help u when u weak,btohqsg
