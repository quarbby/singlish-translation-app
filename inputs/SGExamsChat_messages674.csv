oh that was my cca in jc also,btohqsg
Nope my math teacher was the in charge and i was not gonna show him i wasn't doing math both in his class and cca either,btohqsg
maybe they changed it then bc of people like me,btohqsg
Its not boring when its your turn to do it,btohqsg

Tbh it is my high expectation coz my sec sch all 5 performing arts distinction one,btohqsg
That is why the band pres messaged me to join lmao,btohqsg
Man didn't have certs of accomplishment all along or smth iirc,btohqsg
My dad LAUGHED when i told him they destroyed my portfolio,btohqsg
And be like ‘and what u want to do w ur portfolio’,btohqsg
I regretted choosing my pipa back then in sec sch cause the 基本功 is not smth that can be easily mastered just within the span of 3-4 years,btohqsg
I dk how i didnt make it to CO,btohqsg
Maybe coz it was my 3rd choice,btohqsg
Things were complicated (i cant rmb what was my 2nd  but shooting was my 1st),btohqsg
Wasn't there some CCA trial and shortlisting process,btohqsg
But i didnt go to shooting trials,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like tmsports CCA v upz,btohqsg
Is it actly that upz tho,btohqsg
Then they openly say they help ppl in like those who didnt get selected for the remaining choices,btohqsg
your parents really the pinnacle of supportive…,btohqsg
Tbh i letting them be  i will heat things up if i say things,btohqsg
Idk how did i end up w that lmao and didnt go for trials,btohqsg
Wah seh what instrument u played,btohqsg
But idk my parents are just too unreasonable n im not sure if co would be ok to them😢,btohqsg
I rmb bedok talking about you always clowning during the combined sessions sia,btohqsg
No actually the shooting teacher told us they took in some ppl out of pity (coz got into none of the choices),btohqsg
And i never excelled in it,btohqsg
I actually was fr nusco (percussion) coz stupid wind symphony has sun night practices,btohqsg
it's ok you're getting closer to the point where you can fully ignore them if you want to,btohqsg
like given what you've said about them la,btohqsg
Tbh looking back  what could they hv done if I ultimately joined band,btohqsg
I hv one senior who is in 5 performing arts grps in nus,btohqsg
In fact i can just bluff them😢😢,btohqsg
my parents dgaf about my ecs now,btohqsg
Not like percussion have anything to bring back,btohqsg
So they wun find out anyways,btohqsg
Actually at most just get scolded,btohqsg
Not like they can do anything,btohqsg
I used to play this instrument called the yang qin but its all history now,btohqsg
Bopes im not talented so i have to clown for the conductor,btohqsg
Meanwhile im bullied by the conductor,btohqsg
The thing is my parents gonna kill me:-(,btohqsg
Wah seh which section does your yangqin belong to and what kind of pieces do u rmb and hate playing,btohqsg
I remembered arguing w them till the very last day,btohqsg
"""if a yi girl gets 90rp she's my wife""top 10 scenerios that will never happen irl",btohqsg
my jc too stupid to get 90rp,btohqsg
class of 2023 max rp is 88,btohqsg
tells u how retarded yijc is,btohqsg
still power to that 88 tho,btohqsg
But without pw and h1 content quite sure from 2025 onwards there will be at least one 70rp per cohort,btohqsg
And if de silva is replaced might have more,btohqsg
and now RI/HC will have like 80% 70RP rate bro,btohqsg
How can it be lol I don’t think their GP dist rate is that high,btohqsg
I would think their GP dist rate is 60-65%,btohqsg
Maybe like half 70rp is more realistic,btohqsg
60% assuming RI GP rate is 5/6 in 10 get A,btohqsg
my batch was 6 in 10,btohqsg
why gas ge been the principal for so long,btohqsg
Ya sia. All the other merged JCs had a change of principal after the merger,btohqsg
Yijc is the only one that haven’t change yet,btohqsg
Make the most out of the circumstances you're in  use it to your own advantages,btohqsg
Confirm have one it's just you have yet to see it or idk,btohqsg
based on my own experience and my other ip friends stories,btohqsg
in ip schs some teachers dont rly bother,btohqsg
they give you readings and worksheets,btohqsg
ny peaked during your time meh?,btohqsg
yaisa. they only want the grades but sg education is pushing to have a more holistic education not everything depends on grades anymore.,btohqsg
khanacademy saved my ass through ip,btohqsg
for me it was copying friends hw,btohqsg
did yall have compulsory projects throughout y1-y4,btohqsg
i had 2 projects per subject so 12 a year then 48 projects across y1-y4,btohqsg
that thing wah fun is fun but damn mafan,btohqsg
ppl want us to have good grades cuz only good grades can go so far,btohqsg
my sec4 was about stats bruh,btohqsg
1st sem was stats2nd sem was about applying trigo irl,btohqsg
you have to do creative project about a math topic,btohqsg
basically the cognitive bias of swimmer's body illusion,btohqsg
i had to make rube goldberg forenglishproject,btohqsg
last time for math we had to do desmos drawings,btohqsg
YA YA THAT WAS MY SEC2 PROJECT,btohqsg
use desmos to make posters right,btohqsg
lol we did it in sec3  sec2 was some measurement stuff (ez A),btohqsg
no is like they ask us to draw something in desmos based on the theme (COVID 19),btohqsg
Ya it was q fun act,btohqsg
it was my favourite out of all the math projects,btohqsg
i remember doing that for a friend in the states so she could graduate high school lol,btohqsg
too broke to hire new principal ah,btohqsg
Maybe they think yijc doesn’t deserve a better principal,btohqsg
@chemcerdamn nus assumes everyone gets U for PW,btohqsg
what does the portal look like,btohqsg
if you selected A levels they should have asked for GP and PW before you key in your subjects,btohqsg
ye I know  just trolling with bedok as per usual,btohqsg
Yeah probably will try to stay as as principal as long as he can until he’s forced to retire,btohqsg
But anyway if moe asks him to move to another sch he will just have to follow,btohqsg
Hopefully not another jc tho lol,btohqsg
even they dont hv hope in us,btohqsg
i mean i dont blame them,btohqsg
the mean n median rp confirm damn bad 😂😂😂,btohqsg
but too bad they gonna close down le,btohqsg
Well while it’s true that the results are bad because most of the ppl inside yijc are clowns  the principal definitely plays a part too. Just look at srjc and nyjc’s meteoric rise. Nyjc’s cop literally halved for both streams in just 15+ years. The principal before Mr Low implemented a lot of good practices and took care of the welfare of students.,btohqsg
Then the results also improved tremendously as the sch became more popular and began attracting better students,btohqsg
So basically as long as de silva stays in yijc no hope of any improvement lol,btohqsg
The cop fell from 19 in the mid/late 2000s to 12 in 2017 just before the merger,btohqsg
i actually regret letting them rule me tbh  coz it really spoiled my jc  like 2y of dragging myself to a cca that i dun like twice a week,btohqsg
this is my freaking chem teacher  actually only my econs teacher cared about our grades,btohqsg
the other teachers are more of see and accept what we have,btohqsg
Oh wow I would’ve expected AJC to have better teachers,btohqsg
it is more of moe needs to redo its principal qualification,btohqsg
the fact that shit principal exist in their system,btohqsg
TM and i think YI and MI too,btohqsg
Yi should’ve gotten Mr Low Chun meng tbh,btohqsg
there are teachers who legit idk how to say but dun push for the grades anymore,btohqsg
They need it more than VS,btohqsg
TM should have Lim Yan Hock stay sia,btohqsg
tm which teachers u wld say to watch out for,btohqsg
Bro how is garena still surviving,btohqsg
Message me if you want a free video 😘bruh this the translation,btohqsg
I feel it’s a student attitude problem also tbh,btohqsg
So far my teachers all not bad,btohqsg
Most of the ppl in hybrid:-(I think i was the number of ppl w AAA/A can be counted w 1 hand,btohqsg
It's if the ppl give a shit also,btohqsg
This year is like full capacity so maybe things abit slow,btohqsg
Idk my batch got 31 classes or smth,btohqsg
Then temp timetable was 2 weeks,btohqsg
I don't regret my combi still tho,btohqsg
Continuation- PE: Mr yusof- Econs: Ms Halimah but TM ECONS IS THE MOST LIT DEPARTMENT!!!!!!!- Math: Dr Lina (makes me want to fall asleep)  Mr Lim Aik Leong (coz he dun really teach lmao)- Chem: Mrs Serena Neo  there is another one that idk her name  short hair be-spectacled,btohqsg
I literally nvr heard of her,btohqsg
First time handle so much class🤣,btohqsg
Tbh i hate it that my classmates will act ‘surprised’ at my grades when they be calling me a mugger. It is their problem for not studying  not my problem for studying and getting whatever i got lmao.,btohqsg
I thought yi don’t have one,btohqsg
gg PW cher makes a difference to the grades actually  but i think u in the p/f batch so it is fine,btohqsg
??? I tot there are tutorials every week,btohqsg
My class full of tm rejects lmao,btohqsg
WHAT??? It is already a month,btohqsg
Their R5 net is like 11~15,btohqsg
😡 A community cat in Bedok was found with all of his whiskers cut off.➡️https://bit.ly/48qzyWrFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Not doing well is not coz it is not possible to do well in that combination coz idk what reason coz combi is self-picked…it is not doing well coz they dun study and care,btohqsg
Way mine got 41 lmao…35 sci and 6 arts,btohqsg
Ya there's a reason I chose who I rather spend more time ard la💀,btohqsg
Actually to add on  TM’s GP department CMI,btohqsg

The ppl just look at class list lmao  coz pass ard mah so everyone can see everyone mark  then my name is the top so easy access,btohqsg
Wait that one is for what exam sia,btohqsg
Im surprised coz tm and yi is v far away + there is cj and jp in between,btohqsg
Tm cop drop from 13 to 12,btohqsg
my sch i think majority starts out as 4h2,btohqsg
Then 13 points like me thrown into yi,btohqsg
Can go JP but it’s so far,btohqsg
Prolly damn unlikely U choose jp,btohqsg
tbh do you guys think i should drop to h1 hist,btohqsg

Tbh they dunnid that to see my grades,btohqsg
Coz my name displayed on the board during lecture,btohqsg
I want wake up later haha,btohqsg
if like a girl walk past and a group of boys start shouting this 1 boy name what does it mean actl,btohqsg
But it is just like they pretending idk how to say but they will act surprised,btohqsg
Tbh i heard that ppl fr the other CMEp class keep talking about me,btohqsg
Plus it’s possible to do well if get rid of that defeatist mindset,btohqsg
My sec school was 30mins further then everyday I feel like a zombie,btohqsg
By the time afternoon already no energy to do work,btohqsg
My xenophobia is abt to jump out,btohqsg
Is JP legit a lot better,btohqsg
Idk idk just know that the merger went well,btohqsg
I mean I watched the Solomon video after I receive my results,btohqsg
And I’m like fuck it I’m going to,btohqsg
I think during my math lecture some J2s was like creating a scene outside,btohqsg
Like push the guy into our LT,btohqsg
ngl i feel old when i see the y1s,btohqsg
Current YI j2 and J1s are like two end of the spectrum,btohqsg
I think maybe coz the cop screwd up,btohqsg
Like I only see a few J2s mugging,btohqsg
But then J1s is like taking up the whole library,btohqsg
Like bro we just started the lecture what’s there to mug,btohqsg
Oh ye be freezing in the library always,btohqsg
Last Friday I saw quite a lot couples from tm also,btohqsg

Got some math program at 3pm but optional,btohqsg
I actually dun hv temp timetable,btohqsg
My classmates last time do that,btohqsg
Then end up late for h1,btohqsg
I remembered during recess my friend spam photo w my ohone,btohqsg

Now lecture still hv attendance anot,btohqsg
I tot will get into trouble if mia,btohqsg
My friend say H2 physics don't even have attendance,btohqsg
I missed h3 lesson coz i was sick then I didnt know i need to take the yellow form for h3,btohqsg
