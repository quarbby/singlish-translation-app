Get a back seat driver makes lots of sounds,btohqsg
u go listen audi supercharger or even dodge supercharger cfm louder then tesla maybe not even close haha,btohqsg
floor yes  but idt the noise is the same haha,btohqsg
All I hear from Tesla's are people screaming about instant torque inside or passengers being scared when the driver floors it everywhere and cuts off people with aggressive driving,btohqsg
hahaha right right  i got see on road before very fast sia but abit unnecessary they keep flooring on the fast laneðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Love the effort they put in the sound   interior design and the overall feel,btohqsg

Just tail gate and high beam,btohqsg
Just just tail gate and high beam,btohqsg
I think if they're tailgating and high beaming  you should move out  road hogging no?,btohqsg
If they're tailgating and keeping up  probably means they can go faster and want to move ahead,btohqsg
No   u can be in middle lane   and disturb that guy   he know his acceleration canâ€™t win . So just stay behind you,btohqsg
aiyo why disturb no need la  on signal go left or right lane then go past him lo,btohqsg
Idk   maybe ppl driving speed limit thinks they helping those behind ?,btohqsg
no need like until like that la middle lane leh give chance abit,btohqsg
Why disturb though  if you know he cannot out accelerate then you know already. Let him by or speed up?,btohqsg
Is they got emotional damage when I try to change lane they accelerate  so I also accelerate and take over Thier lane,btohqsg
Get emotional damage   donâ€™t try overtake so tail gate,btohqsg
I think this one more than them you got emotional damage one,btohqsg
No la just abusing the acceleration,btohqsg
U want go which lane can go which lane   does not matter they give way anot,btohqsg
aiyo give chance la. be nice to others can alr no need show whoâ€™s car faster if anyt that one they see tesla alr know,btohqsg
