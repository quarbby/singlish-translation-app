The powerful results come after a run that has seen its stock price more than double in less than a year  leading to a valuation north of $2 trillion. That‚Äôs because Nvidia is the dominant supplier of chips needed to train and operate large generative artificial intelligence models  which  you may have noticed  are quite the thing.‚ÄúDominant‚Äù is maybe an understatement. Nvidia isestimatedto control more than 90% of the market for specialized AI chips. But you can bet there are competitors with their eye on a piece of that pie.Nvidia‚Äôs path to superstardom in the AI economy started with a happy accident.¬†The company designs graphics processing units  or GPUs  which were intended to  that‚Äôs right  process graphics.‚ÄúFor a long time  these chips were mostly used in computer gaming ‚Äù said Chris Miller  author of ‚ÄúChip War: The Fight for the World‚Äôs Most Critical Technology.‚ÄùHe said GPUs can run multiple calculations at once instead of in a sequence. ‚ÄúAnd it turned out that that same set of calculations were useful in training and deploying AI systems ‚Äù he said.Nvidia‚Äôs leaders leaned into their first-mover advantage  said Daniel Newman  CEO and tech analyst at the Futurum Group.‚ÄúNvidia doesn‚Äôt just have a vision of saying  ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs sell lots of GPUs.‚Äô You know  Nvidia has a vision of owning an AI factory or a stack ‚Äù he said.The company has created a whole ecosystem geared to AI ‚Äî from networking technology to software. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve basically shortcut the whole process ‚Äù Newman said.,btohqsg
i can't believe i skimmed through this,btohqsg
