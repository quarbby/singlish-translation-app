1990 e30 m40  but i bouhgt it in 2004 becoming the 6th owner. it has 152000km then and i ran it to 600 000+ km today. this is a workhorse,btohqsg
but requires a lot of time and care.,btohqsg
coz u said you ALREADY won so they eliminated you,btohqsg
m40 is 316 right i confused that time u say m3 hahaha,btohqsg
yeah. i blast it to 6200 rpm all the time. it just loved it.,btohqsg
i had 316i and also m3,btohqsg
wah making the most outta the 100hp sia haha,btohqsg
the e30 is manual  light and enjoyable to drive. it feels just the same as the m3  just smaller power. the way it anchors the road  braking. all same,btohqsg
due to balance. and yes i drove this e30 to phuket in 2014,btohqsg
and it still has the same original exhaust  although the rubbers have worn out a few times due to wear and tear. the rubbers that used to support the exhaust,btohqsg
old stuff lasts long. very very long.,btohqsg
what colour is your e30 sir?  and which m3 do you have as your second bmw?  wah.. your life my dream.,btohqsg
good condition despite blasting to redline often,btohqsg
the more i do the better is fuel economy. the key is good quality engine oil and frequent change. oil must be hot before driving hard. of all the oils i tried  i like castrol edge 0w30,btohqsg
so  who says you cannot drive at5000-6000rpm? this is the power band and extremely exhilarating. the manual gearbox is very rewarding and fun changing gears at 5000+,btohqsg
dry plugs too. i almost dont change plugs. NGK pugs are super lasting,btohqsg
I am glad everything improved after you changed out the pistons and conrod. 👍👍,btohqsg
just showing you high revv driving does not destroy engine.,btohqsg
i do it in alfa bmws,btohqsg
later i changed steering to e46. this is the best feel. the original e30 steering is bad,btohqsg
where do you source the conrod and pistons for this e30?,btohqsg
No la where got like that one😆 There was only a slim 1/789 chance for our bro here to win the prize leh!,btohqsg
minus him then i will get 788 chances mah 🤣,btohqsg
Maybe you will win in our next giveaway👀,btohqsg
i did this rack conversion in JB. costs me rm350 for the rack,btohqsg
but the bmw rack is notorious for leaks. each and every one of them leaks oils,btohqsg
Conrods also very easy to bend. Pistons also need to change.,btohqsg
dont know where you got such belief! unless you suck in water,btohqsg
That is very rude Mr Teo,btohqsg
just because i drive at high revvsbut below redline conrods will bend?,btohqsg
then i am sure many M3s are made for rebuilt then,btohqsg
peopl;e buy M3s in order to drive hard and near redline. they are as durable as ever when taken good care  with regular oil change and good oils and good habits of not blasting engine under NO load,btohqsg
Disagreement with a person's opinion is alright,btohqsg
"But there is no need to say stuff like you suck in water and how do you believe such ""shit""",btohqsg
but it is true. if engine sucks in water then con rods can bend,btohqsg
what is wrong with you? you so fragile?,btohqsg
if you disagree  it is fine. but i am sharing my living experiences driving this. i have escaped floods a few times in malaysia.,btohqsg
but i have had cam belts changed twice because they are broken. this is the nasty thing that you must observe changing early.,btohqsg
"I believe@Cxspeedmeant ""unless the engine sucked in water"". He was missing a punctuation",btohqsg
yes i meant that and didnt i say that?,btohqsg
you sucked in water = your engine,btohqsg
Like final destination for the bus driver,btohqsg
how come he forgot to close door? he surely knew as it is noisy,btohqsg
Looks like Tesla's are not made from vibranium,btohqsg
this kind can be very hard to repair?,btohqsg
the top is sheared off the support broken,btohqsg
Especially because Tesla bodyshops are rare and take a long time in general,btohqsg
i am inclined to think he is trying to show off haha,btohqsg
well he paid the price for showing off then,btohqsg
