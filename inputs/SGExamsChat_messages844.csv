Bro u digged a message from July,btohqsg
sgexams isn't even a community mostly meant for anything outside school & academics-wise,btohqsg
"hi guys  does anyone know or have interacted with redditu/pyroSevenbecause why is bro justifying & encouraging this unhealthily toxic  hidden trend of ""elitism"" in singapore?",btohqsg
his most recent comments combined on r/sgexams has nearly a total of -200 downvotes lol,btohqsg
he's still active from this morning when i posted a random comment,btohqsg
like for one user's community post comments  alone,btohqsg
but honestly reddit's algorithm method of calculating post scores & comment karma  isn't reliable at all,btohqsg
i could use this ( past info )  as a reference to how active i am on the internet when it's not really an updated information i would personally consider sharing nowadays,btohqsg
the amount of ridiculous content being shared on sgexams baffles me,btohqsg
i get spiking high blood pressure,btohqsg
from the comments section  as well,btohqsg
LOL that's his only positive up-voted comment,btohqsg
This one more than 200 downvotes already,btohqsg
i wanted to say -100 at first  but one comment already had -97,btohqsg
the post hasn't reached 24 hrs sial..,btohqsg
wtf was his most recent comment did i see  in this post,btohqsg
he talks as if he has no ounce of a single respect for anyone aside from people of authority  higher education / skills ( aka more recognized qualifications ) & career that's more commonly known??,btohqsg
even then  he's probably gonna be the type to be complaining more negative stuff with the people he encounters in healthcare  retail or customer service lines of work,btohqsg
ya i hate this kind of comments,btohqsg
usually i just avoid looking at reddit for the sake of my sanity,btohqsg
adds literally no value to the discussion,btohqsg
the only active communities on reddit i tend to follow with  or comment more often are more full of people with basic politeness & respectr/cDramar/noveltranslationsr/novelupdatestwo of the subreddits i mentioned are generally inactive / dead  and then the other more active one is mainly more regulated with the community moderation-wise,btohqsg
wtf are people upvoting comments like these forthe one specially by r/pyroSeven,btohqsg
LOL is r/SMRTRabak a shit post reddit,btohqsg
just don't get caught can alr,btohqsg
i also usually only use youtube,btohqsg
i don't even use spotify ü•≤,btohqsg
mostly its posts concerning the mrt system,btohqsg
even then  that clickbait title & nail photo was fucking random,btohqsg
lol these people would rather complain and post online  compared to bothering to do something irl,btohqsg
is like another ver of r/singaporehappenings,btohqsg
i hate spotify with their ui/ux changes,btohqsg
but i never really got used to it,btohqsg
when i want to listen to a song it plays another,btohqsg
i still prefer this older versions,btohqsg
i hate sg reddit communities in general,btohqsg
in general foreign communities also got a lot of propaganda going on,btohqsg
i might as well entertain myself with r/HonkaiStarRail or r/MobileLegendsBangBang,btohqsg
but i would prefer foreign communities compared to sg,btohqsg
i mean the r/singapore reddit is foreign made,btohqsg
majority of the moderators are not singaporeans,btohqsg
no lah  just generally speaking because i don't really condone or support the idea of showing literally zero etiquette online with singaporeans who are usually interacting with online people  aka strangers,btohqsg
i consider r/singaporeraw more local than that,btohqsg
there's a bunch of brainwashing propaganda that misleads everyone,btohqsg
just because of the r/singapore subreddit title of the community itself,btohqsg
Also here is something you may not know about r/Singapore,btohqsg
i think i know about the weird feature of social app,btohqsg
r/ russia created by ukraine r/ china created by usa ü§£,btohqsg
don't really understand it too deeply myself or the idea of such,btohqsg
but i'll just shrug it off and go about my own life,btohqsg
cause i think russia & china have their own localized & major social platforms,btohqsg
so citizens infiltrate the other social platforms out of boredom,btohqsg
through the help of VPN ‚ú®,btohqsg
their own VPNs works better within their nation  as compared to overseas VPN that tourists might be using when they go over LOL,btohqsg
though  usually it works only with a local telco number,btohqsg
heres another thing you may not know,btohqsg
Sgexams is among the top 10 for education reddit channels,btohqsg
LOL this was another weird fact that we all probably only realized some time later  and also don't even understand,btohqsg
personally speaking  i don't wanna bother trying to understand too many things that don't require my attention or assistance,btohqsg
VKontakte(more recognized as VK for short),btohqsg
ok  enough cursed reddit posts to show for today,btohqsg
reminds me of my time as a CP (couple-pairing) fangirl over a bunch of people who were usually involved with romantic allegations,btohqsg
and these very same people are normally the ones i interact with ü§°,btohqsg
wait  what's thatyou mean you just ship people or?,btohqsg
i still have a bunch of ship fanarts,btohqsg
^yall think this will be more expensive or less compared to the current private owners vehicle COE lol,btohqsg
it won't affect them  unless they use their own personal cars to do private-hailing jobs,btohqsg
ya but my opinion still stands,btohqsg
my dad did a grab private-hire driving job before,btohqsg
he struggled with handling his personal administrative work LOL,btohqsg
I mean this is a leading reason for private cars tho  so taking out these fleet entities from upbidding on actual private cars will impact the private car market in retrospect,btohqsg
ya but you gotta understand that there's probably a bunch of people misusing buying a private-hire use ONLY system,btohqsg
if a private hailing platform doesn't detect such abuse on the driver's part finding loopholes,btohqsg
but when it gets too problematic,btohqsg
that's where issues like a possible separate COE pricing plan gets brought up,btohqsg
i mean if every 3rd or 4th car you see on the road is a private hire car/taxi and not for personal use...thats problematic aint it,btohqsg
though drivers with private hire usage cars  often just trying to end up hiding the private hire sticker away,btohqsg
i noticed when taking newer private hires with things like TADA & gojek  early in the morning with my dad when i follow him to work,btohqsg
or like usually when i take private hire car,btohqsg
Total vehicles on our roads from 2013 to 2023,btohqsg
LOL  only the cars that are under private-hire registered are gradually increasing over the years,btohqsg
the rest are usually just fluctuating with barely no change  stagnant amount or a gradual decline,btohqsg
the shift is due to the taxi decreasing,btohqsg
surprised there are more lories or heavy vehicles than the rest,btohqsg
the range of flexibility and freedom were called benefits & bonus people considered to prefer  but it's not actually any different,btohqsg
in the long run  these very same flexibility & benefits will end up becoming more like standardized & regular with normal terms found in other jobs,btohqsg
"A substantial amount of logistics companies have a ""extra"" lot for their trucks",btohqsg
unless you consider those trailer trucks,btohqsg
coz that's usually registered as two,btohqsg
local logistics delivery services have trucks less than 10 trucks per office now,btohqsg
cause there's been a gradual decline of logistics companies located at actual spacious areas like industrial parks,btohqsg
for context  my father's full-time job had his logistics delivery company office moved from Defu Lane Industrial Park to an office around the Northeast Town Area ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
i mean looking at statistics  the two main truck brands ive seen on our roads Hino and Isuzu have not registered a new vehicle on our roads since 2014So its safe to say  there is alot alot of old workhorses still on our roads,btohqsg
??? does toyota heavy-weight vehicles not exist to you,btohqsg
those other two truck brands are so much more older as compared to brands like toyota  mitsubishi etc,btohqsg
even for the same box truck vehicles LOL,btohqsg
Toyota only has the atlas  maybe you could say mitsubishi,btohqsg
since they have the fuso  across various gens,btohqsg
eh but funny fact is that all trucks are considered heavy-weight in sg,btohqsg
even if it's categorized under as light  heavy & very heavy-weight,btohqsg
i don't consider most goods & passenger services vehicles,btohqsg
cause alot of brands dont produce conventional heavy weight trucks anymore,btohqsg
like you will see the road & traffic signs,btohqsg
just using the term heavy-weight vehicle for anything more than a laden weight of 2500kg or 3000kg,btohqsg
cause there's barely even any need for an extra production of them  in sg,btohqsg
The prob with mitsubishi is  now the icon of the fuso is now becoming a semi truck,btohqsg
this is usually for trailer trucks,btohqsg
which are considered longer in length-wise,btohqsg
cause this is the type of trucks that have two license plates somehow at the front & back,btohqsg
the life span of these trucks on our roads so far ive seen a ton have not kept to the 17 yr rule,btohqsg
but it's also mostly considered as heavy-weight (goods) vehicles,btohqsg
no one really follows the rules very stringently,btohqsg
yea unlike cars  these keep getting their coe renewed,btohqsg
or publicized virally on the internet,btohqsg
ive seen mitsubishi's that are 30 yr old still on our roads,btohqsg
cars are seen more often on roads,btohqsg
we rarely see like 1:1 ratio of cars & heavy goods vehicles,btohqsg
but like  that's still pretty rare,btohqsg
but its interesting how like majority of thr heavy goods vehicles on our roads are around 20 years old,btohqsg
we don't realize something like statistics of driving or general facts about sg  on a normal everyday basis,btohqsg
people r hating but he‚Äôs lowkey right,btohqsg
do u take everyday morning & night showers,btohqsg
dude's thinking everyone has the luxury  ability  time and energy to do that every day,btohqsg
even if u turn on the ac ur face will be oily,btohqsg
if you're in a rush then how leh,btohqsg
and i got an oily scalp so i shower in the morning,btohqsg
if rush then rly bopian just skip,btohqsg
most singaporeans rarely have such greatly regular good habits,btohqsg
even if we do wanna stick through with them,btohqsg
every week  there's bound to be days where you aren't able to stick to proper schedule,btohqsg
even when you forget to bring something by the time you step outside of your home and need to spend another 5-15~ minutes  heading back to grab what you forgot (if you're still nearby lah),btohqsg
plus this reddit dude doesn't seem to have a very good record of respectfully saying things,btohqsg
make it a habit to have a quick rinse in the morning la,btohqsg
according to his past commented stuff on reddit,btohqsg
i go jc morning need chiong i still just quickly take one shower alm everyday,btohqsg
i‚Äôm a guy la so it‚Äôs pretty quick but like even if u skip the shampoo should still be ok,btohqsg
plus  if you're a person of the fairer sex.. abit jialat,btohqsg
like it doesn‚Äôt take a crazy amount of effort to not stink up,btohqsg
usually just substitute in other forms of freshening up,btohqsg
people don't stink so much at the start of the day ngl  no matter how disgusting things sound,btohqsg
it's only when the day ends..,btohqsg
i just avoid optimal routes of travelling back if i end late  or delay going back home LOL,btohqsg
at least for my own observations,btohqsg
i just alight a few stops,btohqsg
bus wise  i try to go to a corner with lesser pungent scents or smell my medicated oils,btohqsg
people should just shower in the mornings la,btohqsg
doesn‚Äôt take that long + cold water wakes u up,btohqsg
for guys  it's easier to manage ngl,btohqsg
as a girl  i take at least a total of 10+ minutes to freshen myself up,btohqsg
most of the time it‚Äôs guys that smell like shit in the mornings,btohqsg
idk why i smell there's more more muskier or masculine hormone scent from most guys,btohqsg
even at the start of the day,btohqsg
i think its because it's the start of the day,btohqsg
at the point  i would prefer to get choked by cologne,btohqsg
no leh  girls also tend to not shower early in the morning as well,btohqsg
like they actually bother to maintain their skin + body routines,btohqsg
can everyone just take a morning shower,btohqsg
i rly don‚Äôt get why that guy was getting hate,btohqsg
the hate he got was more about his attitude anyways,btohqsg
the way he definitely assumed things as such,btohqsg
validated opinions  sure but one that throws ppl off,btohqsg
especially in r/sgexams but i gave up tracking subreddit,btohqsg
he roams around multiple reddit communities,btohqsg
so maybe it's more of his character & preference with doing stuff,btohqsg
i know people who appear like red flags online  but are total sweethearts irl,btohqsg
People are more willing to pull off bold stunts under the guise of anonymity (on the internet) no?,btohqsg
but there's generally a lesser amount of etiquette of showing basic respect  politeness and integrity online,btohqsg
at least from my own observations since 2017,btohqsg
it should be due to this effect,btohqsg
things may be changing for the better  but generally some things are the same,btohqsg
just a bit more disguised or mixed intentions,btohqsg
it's like that mike tyson quote,btohqsg
"""Social media made y'all way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it.""",btohqsg
"i know ah  but i personally never understood or could ever find a reasonable explanation to console myself with that common assumption of believing the virtual world stays separate from the real life world ""idea""which isn't wrong either  but most don't know1)WHENto show & understand differentiated forms of Virtual WorldOnline  vsIn-real Lifepersonalities2)WHYis it a tendency to convince or want others to do something  but not be open to hearing out more perspectives & long-windedness3)WHATis the ""supposedly"" generalized idea ofOnline Etiquetteto show  as compared to whether it's something to normalize for both the virtual vs reality world  and like whether there're any contrast weather they can notably politely try to respectfully understand",btohqsg
mike tyson and other notable industry-specified professionals  get drained so fast when they socially interact with a lot of other online users,btohqsg
"im just staring at the reception to his recent match that he ""lost""",btohqsg
this is a real struggle  even for those people who aren't considered to be on-par with any kind of famous entertainment industry figures,btohqsg
even though they have fans  sure but they tend to have separate cultures with all their specified communities,btohqsg
at least before the internet just decided to blotch everything together,btohqsg
were you always awake as well.. lol,btohqsg
night is the only alone time + watching football match also,btohqsg
I only know historia from attack on titan,btohqsg
Are there still any places to donate ur old assignment books and stuff,btohqsg
I guess but might take awhile?,btohqsg
my brain had a aneurysm reading that,btohqsg
Ye was overseas during then rip,btohqsg
hmmm which mod should i ping,btohqsg
But tbh I feel that they should not have signed Mbappe,btohqsg
He's kind of a flop at Real Madrid,btohqsg
Oh and it's football not soccer üòÖ,btohqsg
football means something else in America,btohqsg
isn't it the other way round  cuz soccer came from the french football sport? iirc soccer is usually meant for football games internationally speaking  but americans have their own version  as wellwhich is american football  an evolution of rugby & soccer,btohqsg
but ngl which person sg uses mostly British English  outside of schools & maybe work,btohqsg
you just don't realise how much of the stuff we use is british english,btohqsg
hii guys random but can yall deco my tree:))https://decomytree.com/home?hashedId=QqdxPdtVDmfk&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaYWSmAhrrt121dgpLj-zAcjJudCRG60dI_ufvpI2BeDHMKD80EGlw20uwE_aem_P3SH1JrByRoloTOnXaXE-Aif yall free Hahha,btohqsg
ü•¥ terrorist taken control of Syria,btohqsg
nobody local has the morale to fight...it was bound to happen,btohqsg
"i meant internet social chatting wise ppl in sg use it more interchangeably instead of just simply using one type of Englishlike when it comes remembering the rules of ""correct"" english that since SG used to be a pre-existing british colonial nation  no one really gives a damn outside of official settings like school / work",btohqsg
people don‚Äôt use it interchangeably really,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs ingrained in most of us,btohqsg
Syria has a russian military base  would be interesting to see what happens to it,btohqsg
not good news for middle east and the world,btohqsg
do you use more of the letter Z or S  when it comes to conjunctions? cause i don't really bother so much about logically collected data from statistics surveys done in general,btohqsg
it's more of a generalized observation from myself ig,btohqsg
like in terms of social internet texting  messaging alike,btohqsg
texting is just short hand etc but like,btohqsg
certain words like ‚Äúlift‚Äù are inherently british,btohqsg
i mean the european side not so good either  a month ago germany disbanded their govt..now recently france as welltheres a bunch of chaos in many countries worldwide..tough world its becoming,btohqsg
and also it‚Äôs like even if we text informally,btohqsg
what we know as correct grammar is british,btohqsg
for me bc i‚Äôve edited articles on an american website before im v used to switching,btohqsg
if you consider the so-called grammatical rules of british as well  then obviously what u say applies,btohqsg
because i was mostly referring to a lot of informally done texting over the virtual world of social media,btohqsg
i mean if you want you can consider sg as having its own form,btohqsg
that's cool  though usually i generalise very specifically in terms of subjectively speaking as well,btohqsg
if i add myself as reference,btohqsg
mit has a survey where you fill it in and they can guess p accurately what type of english you speak,btohqsg
people love to assume (for my case la)that im somehow narcissistic,btohqsg
and yes sg is one of them,btohqsg
for me they guessed american before sg bc of my experience,btohqsg
so like our grammar is kinda all over the place but our vocab is very very british,btohqsg
as for myself who I consider to be very involved in terms of creative writing  i had to do the test at least 2 times to get Singaporean English detected from that survey LOL,btohqsg
"Is ""time to makan"" english? many used them",btohqsg
yea it was a temporary situation but it showed major cracks within the french govt,btohqsg
They really guessed singaporean as the first choice,btohqsg
I thought my English was pretty standard,btohqsg
Somehow mine was1) Singaporean2) Australian3) US black vernacular,btohqsg
all these happens while gen z is still trying to gain a footing in society,btohqsg
actually  a bunch of the people born in the late-years of the millennial era as well  aside from the average gen z youths,btohqsg
Your third guess is my first one...,btohqsg
Does this mean I am allowed to say the n word,btohqsg
The third one they put my dialect as scottish lmao,btohqsg
i remember it was around 1996 to 1998,btohqsg
coz some people consider being born 1998  a gen z,btohqsg
plz let me stay forever 12,btohqsg
Adulting is hard but I get to eat ice cream,btohqsg
There's a age range grouping that says millennials is 2004 and below,btohqsg
ya  it gets a little inaccurate sometimes,btohqsg
or like in terms of inconsistency,btohqsg
there's no so-called official listed years of the different generations,btohqsg
Actually range for Gen X and Millennial is too large,btohqsg
in another 10 yrs  it doesn't matter,btohqsg
there is a term Zillennials which i believe is between 1986 and 1997,btohqsg
Gen X 1965 to 1975 Millennial 1976 to 1985,btohqsg
i don't consider myself an adult,btohqsg
so is my friend forever 20,btohqsg
wah shit.. how many years  already sia? more than 3-4?,btohqsg

Bruh how do scammers even get in here lok,btohqsg
iirc this is also a public tele group that can be searched up,btohqsg
so  it's a dead giveaway ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
but all social groups online  experienced this issue before,btohqsg
i like to think the sgexams tele  discord & reddit groups are different in their own ways,btohqsg
despite being part of the same academic community,btohqsg
Coming to Singapore today morning. What‚Äôs cool around in Punggol area lol,btohqsg
My friend going to bring me tour around Punggol üòÇ,btohqsg

Wut Singapore Armed Forces Reservist Association,btohqsg
Why sounds like Ns Thing üòÇ,btohqsg
it is sort of a membership for people who have served / are serving in NS,btohqsg

the only decent network is Singtel,btohqsg
neighbourhood safra's are pretty cool ngl,btohqsg
idk telco brands in sg having their own political story,btohqsg
can write up a film alr,btohqsg
I just switched to Gomo lol,btohqsg
I can finally watch YouTube on train without interruption,btohqsg
everyone switching to gomo after M1/StarHub (im gonna die with giga :c),btohqsg
i need to see if i can port in my hp no. tho,btohqsg
otherwise i might have to change again,btohqsg
I recently changed it to be under my name,btohqsg
i mean i can do it as well,btohqsg
but eh  i throw most money-related matters to my parents for now,btohqsg
i bought international direct calling (IDD) recently just to sign up for weibo ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
It‚Äôs getting kinda expensive tho $15 For 100GB,btohqsg
a few years down the road  when im in my 20s-- i might consider trying to manage everything on my own,btohqsg
it's a 5G package you're looking at,btohqsg
plus (unused) data can be rolled over,btohqsg
Is it so? I just get it as a hand me down SIM card from my siblings üòÇ,btohqsg
gomo is $18 for 300gb 2gb roaming,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it rolls over,btohqsg
Hopefully 100GB is overkill for my use case,btohqsg
Since I am not bring my laptop for work,btohqsg
my singtel slow and disruption every night üò¢,btohqsg
Anything new or worth visiting in Singapore ?,btohqsg
I going for Christmas Wonderland tonight only,btohqsg

u can try checking outilumi singapore  or if you're heading home later in the night; try to catch a glimpse of theSpectra Light & Water Showthat's outside MBS,btohqsg
but u should just select a few places to go before ur christmas wonderland,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that the The Art Science musuem?,btohqsg
otherwise confirm tired by the time u reach gardens by the bay,btohqsg
but different timings  locations & dates,btohqsg
this year's one idk if it was at MBS or ArtScience Museum,btohqsg
probably this:'What is it trying to promote?' Banner calling for passers-by to stare at Tanjong Pagar residents' windows causes confusion,btohqsg
Jewel - drop luggage at 3pm - punggol - chinatown/maxwell - marina barrage - xmas wonderland,btohqsg
actually  sounds pretty jam-packed for one day alr,btohqsg
Is it lol I think mostly is getting  stuck at MRT üòÇ,btohqsg
although I think Chinatown/Maxwell wld be more interesting than punggol,btohqsg
Better buy ticket in advance from Klook. A few of my friends went to Art Science Museum on different days planning to get tickets on the spot all experienced sold out,btohqsg
Beats me üòÇ my friend plan I just follow,btohqsg
Guess which movie i gg to watch tmr,btohqsg
idk what pg movies are there,btohqsg
if u are watching a chinese movie tmr  can share (recs),btohqsg
can just be a X/10 rating as well,btohqsg
tbh i like the musical so im not going into it blind,btohqsg
giga q okay what  been using for a two-ish years now no problem,btohqsg
lately  giga's parent company aka starhub has issues popping up more often than the last two years,btohqsg
i think i have my current hp plan under giga for around 2 years also,btohqsg
but this year  idk why suddenly it became rabak liddat,btohqsg
i heard a lot of fans of the original wicked musical  having a bunch of mixed reactions,btohqsg
but honestly i'll say just enjoy wtv u can LOL,btohqsg
I watched the musical many years ago by an Australian cast and have been listening to the album by the original broadway cast over the years. I won‚Äôt call myself a fan and I enjoyed the movie ‚Äî went in thinking I might not have the attention span of more than 2.5 hours but time flew by,btohqsg
üòÖ was planning to turn off my laggy Apple Watch   but accidentally hit Emergency SOS and cancelled call never knew Singapore 999 would reply aSMS ü§£,btohqsg
Hopefully won‚Äôt randomly call me tomorrow üòÖ,btohqsg
Until I accidentally get a fine hahaha,btohqsg
Anyway Christmas Wonderland kinda a no go tbh üòÇ,btohqsg
Need to get a Light box and wide angle DSLR  else can‚Äôt see shit,btohqsg
feels like just a place to take photos with partners,btohqsg
Yeahhh sadly no see people doing interesting photoshoots tho,btohqsg
Basically this was the entire highlight otherwise pretty much mehhh ü§£,btohqsg
Also given the fact now is rainy and Singapore Humid weather + 20mins walk to this place -I really kennot üòÇ,btohqsg
Hopefully the free ones around Orchard would be good,btohqsg
Oh ya I ended up in Punggol just for the sakes that my friend want to purchase a cheap SAFRA $6 workout T-shirt ü§®,btohqsg
Yeahhh really random. But quite an interesting area sat the LRT saw quite high density Condo / HDB Apartments,btohqsg
actually  i don't think ppl are even allowed to set up any bulky photography equipment in events,btohqsg
there's even rules on what kind of camera tripods are allowed LOL,btohqsg
that's why u will probably see more selfie sticks instead,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think most people get a tripods nowadays. Especially those bulky sturdy camera ones,btohqsg
especially for those professional or hobbyist,btohqsg
haha  ya this is a given,btohqsg
For budget traveller for me flying budget airlines. A tripod easily eats up 1-2kg already lol,btohqsg
Unless you really add on luggage or travel by Bus to Singapore ü§£ or Kaya enough to buy one in SG.,btohqsg
do u usually make use of hand carry + luggage?,btohqsg
Found a nice Durian Cendol for $7.80 at ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂‰∫∫ Bugis,btohqsg
i know ppl just use multiple bags for hand-carry,btohqsg
coz of the 7kg max weight,btohqsg
But in Malaysia if I normally fly domestics KL to Penang,btohqsg
A lot of people abuse the system üòÇ,btohqsg
Your carry on Luggage 23‚Äù you carry max 7kg,btohqsg
Normally i get 16kg through lel,btohqsg
If you flying International on AirAsia at KLIA2 would be much stricter lol,btohqsg
Btw  any famous snack/delicacy in Singapore like your usual go to place or they call it ËÄÅÂ≠óÂè∑Âïä üòÇ,btohqsg
a lot of hand-carry weight to try and squeeze everything tgt,btohqsg
so u don't need to spend extra $$$ on add-on luggage weight,btohqsg
unless u are bringing back a LOT for ur family,btohqsg
Most budget airlines just squeeze to 7kg for two bags policy la,btohqsg
Just depending how expensive is the add on hand carry luggage or checked luggage,btohqsg
who the hell normally carries around 7kg,btohqsg
Your roller luggage would eats up like 1kg. The remainder depends what you packed.  for my 4 day trip in Singapore. A small thin towel  3 sets T shirts  3 Uniqlo Airism  2 pairs of thin breathable shorts   2 sets of night sleeping T shirt  an umbrella  an empty thermal bottle/flask. Your chargers / AirPods / battery bank. Easily slightly exceed 7kg,btohqsg
wtff what kind of luggage is that,btohqsg
I think I found out where my missing kg went lol,btohqsg
"HUUH yours is a 20"" sized luggage ah",btohqsg
Yeahh should be or 23‚Äù didn‚Äôt really remember,btohqsg
luggage + hand-carry should be more than enough eh..,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a hand me down from a friend lol,btohqsg
"i brought a 19"" or 20"" (those mini-sized luggage) & a hand-carry back to the philippines before",btohqsg
ended up staying for around more than 1 month,btohqsg
by the way  this is for both me and my mom,btohqsg
we only bought like 1 or 2 new sets of clothes over there,btohqsg
Yeahhh I think I gotta explore those options eventually because I do realized there‚Äôs a lot of unused empty space üòÇ,btohqsg
you should try to make use of the compartments in the luggage as well,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok if you can pack light and find a cheap washer/dryer place la,btohqsg
even though it might take more time to pack or organize,btohqsg
nah  we went back to my mother's hometown at a rural island,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt really did that this time because I have no clue how Jetstar behaves at KLIA T2,btohqsg
I was fined RM 250 ish at Penang to Singapore for an extra KG üíÄ,btohqsg
So this round KLIA T2 to Singapore I packed super duper light.,btohqsg
@pen_guinii@IcedMilotsk these bots are getting too advanced lololol,btohqsg
its an arms race with the bots,btohqsg

Leap yr is this yr right,btohqsg
leap year doesn't just affect the year itself,btohqsg
I need wake up at 7-8üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
the leap year where there's an additional date of 29 feb,btohqsg
i filled in one 11 hr shift and didn't bother to work anymore,btohqsg
so your parents owned this too?,btohqsg
"but i would say my dad works in a *""family"" company like that",btohqsg
i thought he says his parents did though,btohqsg
my uncle is the company director,btohqsg
but he isn't a directly listed boss,btohqsg
like he doesn't own it i think,btohqsg
Either way wont be the happy ending kind at geylangüî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
more like the family of his superiors decided to dump all the management work to him,btohqsg
plus a lot of establishments are now located at geylang even tho it was once considered a district full of illegal shit,btohqsg
^ refer to my message above,btohqsg
i could say the same for joo chiat..,btohqsg
PSLE November N Level December O Level January A Level February,btohqsg
im procrastinating by not calling a cab,btohqsg
why are u saying the same,btohqsg
im stranded in the middle of marymount road,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a lil dangerous to hang out late at night,btohqsg
um i was tryna search for a missing doggo as soon as i got the news,btohqsg
ill just wait at the newly renovated amk S11 coffee shop,btohqsg
i don't encourage or condone this sort of staying out,btohqsg
even tho i have a bad habit of doing so,btohqsg
js gna wait for my dad,btohqsg
you may encounter a strange creature or monster,btohqsg
thats what i read in heritage sg facebook,btohqsg
walao don't share at this hour leh,btohqsg
this is comparable with ghost stories,btohqsg
i can also lie down here LOL,btohqsg
what did you expect at 3am,btohqsg
i‚Äôve been trying to sleep since 130 üíÄ,btohqsg
i‚Äôve been trying to not sleep since 130,btohqsg
the difference in price of the same ipad is crazy. bought in july. ipad have issues so ended up replacement. lucky bought apple care‚Ä¶,btohqsg
impulsive buying of a newly released product vs waiting it out for market price to drop,btohqsg
even nightlife is not very comparable,btohqsg
how's insomnia looking like for u,btohqsg
idk if u are the kind that ends up sleeping while using ur phone,btohqsg
the period in june- sept when they advertised ‚Äúlowest price  best price for university/ poly students to buy‚Äù,btohqsg
a lot of PR methods when it comes to marketing promotions is very dirty,btohqsg
so u can't take company promotions or ads v seriously,btohqsg
the past 3 nights i heard wind sounds outside,btohqsg
so you search for them every night?,btohqsg
nope  it's actually my first time doing so,btohqsg
more like u are very sensitive to elements like weather,btohqsg
ehh have u ever heard of those very loud sounds that resemble almost like a gunshot or something slamming hard on the ground floor from a high level,btohqsg
i made notes of hearing such strange sounds late at night before,btohqsg
maybe even early in the morning,btohqsg
25 Oct 2024 - Heard a loud sound probably from something crashing to the ground at a decent height around 10:04am,btohqsg
usually gongs are meant for events exclusive to funerals or celebrations,btohqsg
my note on 25 Oct was also where i live around punggol,btohqsg
im ok with more construction works going on,btohqsg
but like wtf is all those strange sightings  sounds  smell,btohqsg
like stuff u would generally feel with ur 5 senses,btohqsg
cuz wwp is more towards punggo central,btohqsg
been experiencing a bunch of weird stuff since 2019,btohqsg
ya i rmbr punggol was quiet and peaceful,btohqsg
i also remembered visiting a see-saw made purely of woodworks around punggol end,btohqsg
probably at least nearly 10 years ago,btohqsg
sumang walk featured in news many times,btohqsg
i moved in around Q3/4 of 2017 and until the end of 2018  it was pretty serene,btohqsg
i consider sumang walk different from my area LOL,btohqsg
ok but seriously speaking right  this BTO at punggol that my dad bought from the 2nd time didn't have sumang walk as the official road name last time,btohqsg
i thought punggol walk was also known as sumang walk,btohqsg
lool this was edgedale plains & edgefield plains for me,btohqsg
might as well do a systemic naming process like sengkang,btohqsg
but i honestly prefer hougang  serangoon north & ang mo kio's naming of places,btohqsg
why i listed these areas is coz either me  and / or  my family  tends to frequent them a lot,btohqsg
coz when my family applied and had our BTO keys ready to collect  the road east actually called sumang walk,btohqsg
like the roads inside punggol way hor  around the 24hr u-stars supermarket (not the one nearby the lrt) that already shuttered their business operations there as well,btohqsg
it used to be referred as sumang lane,btohqsg
er  i only know serangoon north for budget stuff & the maisonettes (2-storey hdb flats),btohqsg
now it's listed as sumang walk,btohqsg
luckily gps is aware that sumnag lane is the unofficial road term for sumang walk,btohqsg
i only have trouble sleeping when i have smth on the next day keeping me up,btohqsg
oh ya  do you know the bus stop opposite twin waterfalls,btohqsg
last time it wasn't referred as blk 220c,btohqsg
i remember it being name as AFT TPE,btohqsg
before the addition of bus 39,btohqsg
ahh  then that's a pretty good sleep pattern,btohqsg
took bus 39 the whole route. regretted ...,btohqsg
u should just use bus 39 to travel in between yishun to punggol  punggol to pasir ris or pasir ris to tampines,btohqsg
that was the purpose of bus 39,btohqsg
Bus 39 can travel to yishun?,btohqsg
most of my sec sch peers use this transport to go to nyp frm punggol,btohqsg
Cus 39 cannot reach further north  only until yishun :/,btohqsg
otherwise if you choose direct bus services like bus 3  34  117 & 85  it'll be too long from punggol temp (bus)  inter(change)no. 3 heads from punggol int to pasir ris & tampinesno. 34 is a loop roundabout from punggol int through the tamp town areas  heading towards the terminals at changi airport and back to punggolbus 117 had the original route changed drastically to give way for the newer bus route 39  cause it was the only one of the two buses that came in the direction of punggol int TO yishun area & sembwang intbus 85 was literally a direct route from punggol to yishun  but also pretty long,btohqsg
i hope to enter nus or smu. ntu is too far.,btohqsg
nah  that's not advisable to follow through,btohqsg
ntu is gonna take me 2-2.45h to go to sch,btohqsg
unless u have spare 1-2 hours to sit through tampines TO yishun & yishun to tampines,btohqsg
I wld say that's fine also but nus and ntu has dorms sooo may wanna consider that also,btohqsg
i heard it‚Äôs difficult to get the dorms,btohqsg
"Esp if you are the ""YAY SCH SPIRIT"" kind",btohqsg
plus the fucking interchange where it stations bus 39  is so fucking ulu,btohqsg
where the fuck is tampines concourse int,btohqsg
I wld say you need to be quite involved in sch*,btohqsg
not even residents living in tampines can certainly say for sure where it is,btohqsg
we are gg to have 3 mrt stations and 2 bus interchange,btohqsg
But if you dont plan on hall  is also fine,btohqsg
when bus 39 came into existence  tampine concourse alr existed,btohqsg
it was more of a depot holding area,btohqsg
I wonder if that is how my jc friends travel to tampines like that,btohqsg
were u from uh greendale or punggol sec,btohqsg
How long is the whole trip in terms of time?,btohqsg
even if i took it from the interchange,btohqsg
or made a transfer bus route,btohqsg
i meant the bus interchange was more open to public,btohqsg
I always loved the part when they are at punggol area,btohqsg
when bus 39 or some other buses were introduced later on,btohqsg
LOOL yeah  a lot of ppl would prefer to travel down to the starting point now,btohqsg
You get to be the lofi girl in punggol,btohqsg
i take the 7am~ bus in the morning as well  can still guarantee a seat,btohqsg
coz one of the nearest bus stops heading towards the other city area & generally in the opposite direction of my hdb estateis only like what? 2 or 3 bus stops away from punggol temp int?,btohqsg
bus 39 originally was at the original interchange,btohqsg
that time  tampines concourse was at the roadside of tampines int,btohqsg
he saed one of my classmate in 2021 i heard,btohqsg
i only recognize staff  classmates etc i was more used to,btohqsg
because its in the middle of nowhere,btohqsg
then the sch principal silenced us not to say,btohqsg
was the sch principal angeline or the new one,btohqsg
omg no wonder the dnt teachers were so short-staffed back then...,btohqsg
both had the same name i think,btohqsg
ya worst part he was sweating somewhere in sec one after that incident,btohqsg
at least even when he was being investigated,btohqsg
apparently he was in a straits time news before,btohqsg
he had decent reputation so he was not charged and fired i heard,btohqsg
my ite east class advisor (form cher) also got into a motorcyclist accident before,btohqsg
i don't understand this sort of shit either,btohqsg
then the sch principal asked me to exchange place w the victim cause we had 2 dnt teacher,btohqsg
which 2na class were u in,btohqsg
and the long route after the twin bus stop was creepy,btohqsg
i heard a lot of the exp students in the same year batch as the both of us  had a lot of grievances,btohqsg
i nearly got expelled by the previous sch principal,btohqsg
ya technically i transferred bcs of the sch environment,btohqsg
which year did u transfer out,btohqsg
toxic tbh that the sch silenced us not to say,btohqsg
i wanted to transfer as well,btohqsg
but mrs huang silenced my options bro,btohqsg
ALL 3 of my primary schools were better than her,btohqsg
which town is the route  part of?,btohqsg
LOLOLOLOL no wonder she got forced to step down,btohqsg
twin bus stops.. like double bus stops ah,btohqsg
i said that i will report to straits times if they silenced me not to say and stay in pss,btohqsg
or like the name of the bus stops,btohqsg
holy shit this was so smart,btohqsg
my parents tried to go down to moe again for me,btohqsg
but i heard the old sch principal had connections with moe itself,btohqsg
ohh ya.. iirc one of the very popular haunted spots was inside a condo,btohqsg
if that was the name of the bus stop you were looking for,btohqsg
but after that even more creepier,btohqsg
i think the condo that you're talking about that still holds the hauntedMatilda Houseup to today  is A Treasure Trove,btohqsg
my parents had zero connections LOL,btohqsg
the only reason why i was able to cope with getting through psle was because of countless support from all the primary schools i went,btohqsg
from zhonghua (serangoon)  to jing shan (ang mo kio)  to punggol (hougang) primary,btohqsg
wait@miffyisntmiffylemme dm you instead coz this convo might be a bit too controversial for an academic chat,btohqsg
blk 220c was a changed bus stop name LOL,btohqsg
the bus driver stop here for rest i ask him to leave immediately üíÄ,btohqsg
thats why i never take buses thay have long routes again they go to many places and may pass by strange places like this,btohqsg
you need to know where you're going also,btohqsg
if you keep your eyes glued too much somewhere else,btohqsg
you'll likely end up getting lost or missing ur stops,btohqsg
when it comes to traveling by bus,btohqsg
