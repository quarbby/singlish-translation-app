Just let him pes f ah,btohqsg
I put NB cuz I didn't understand the nomenclature,btohqsg
Lanjiao why do I feel like this question is targeted at me,btohqsg
passenger train collide with a goods train,btohqsg
uk i put good for them alr,btohqsg
i have 5 months left to farm,btohqsg
Their roads have a higher death toll daily tho its legit merely a statistic at this point,btohqsg
I wanted to get my eyes and teeth done in there,btohqsg
Not statistic but for context imagine in sg everyone in one train die or an entire school popln die,btohqsg
Why u always ask that qn,btohqsg
I don't mean to be an ass but err..Are u seriously comparing a single Indian life equally to a Singaporean life?,btohqsg
Bro i going next month what talking u,btohqsg
Yeah that's not how the world works.. just look at who built the building in front of you can liao,btohqsg
I tot to enter uni one has gotta discharge all their NS obligations,btohqsg
Just get to the point bro,btohqsg
Why yall talking so seriously about life haha,btohqsg
My point is in the economic system a human life is worth more in singapore than in india,btohqsg
I would rather not go both,btohqsg
But u do have to serve both right?,btohqsg
Oh.. so u choose SG Ns?,btohqsg
Cuz I heard u can enter anytime one,btohqsg
Not singaporean or pr so im not serving haha,btohqsg
Walao eh@chemcerwhere u get the idea he SGPR?,btohqsg
Korea Ns more Fd up than SG ns I think,btohqsg
But u can choose when u wanna enter tho,btohqsg
If u can choose SG or Korea one I would say do SG one,btohqsg
Jangbijju for the win with New Recruit,btohqsg
Not only that  SG citizenship (in my opinion) more value than Korean citizenship,btohqsg
What if your family on that train?,btohqsg
but they are worth 2 dollars so they deserve to die right?,btohqsg
Then personally I would feel sad but if my family was on thay train it's gonna be a massive international incident,btohqsg
Unless u rly want to be soldier no point.The salary doesn’t matter cos economic conditions in Korea to get same pay is work so much harder  not worth. Toxic work culture,btohqsg
Yeah I was under the impression it's like damn low,btohqsg
Why doesnt matter tho 4 sgprn only,btohqsg
It matters lol cuz it will affect the entire tourism sector of india,btohqsg
That one in 5 yrs maybe,btohqsg
That's the power of Foreigners being injured,btohqsg
It is not whether i want or dw leh. Im not sg or pr,btohqsg
cmon lah have some sympathy ah,btohqsg
Lemme just make this clear if a Singaporean was in that train we would be hearing the news nonstop 24/7 liao,btohqsg
Can you apply to do Ns and then PR guaranteed or smth?,btohqsg
same ahfor me at school im always rather quiet and introvertedbut when i see other people in my class that are vv quiet i will go up to them and say hi,btohqsg
I do personally it's sad but the world simply works this way,btohqsg
Some ppl love the country or feel long term they wanna be at home it’s ok,btohqsg
Korea cannot dual citizenship means he gave up on being singaporean ig,btohqsg
Lanjiao then the wars we have for fun and die for fun one isit,btohqsg
you ownself say some random straw man fallacies then say the world works this way,btohqsg
But if you came here young and speak little Korean no point you back ba,btohqsg
Idk what's btr. Stuck in cs or going army,btohqsg
and look like idiot marching arnd the parade square,btohqsg
