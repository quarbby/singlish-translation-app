Hi fellow honey money members! I'm about to make a big purchase (watch at hour glass) and wondering how to maximise my purchase with the credit cards I have.I have the following cards:Amex platinum credit cardCitiRewards CC (Master)SC WOW Manhattan ccOCBC Frank CC.Which cards should I use to maximise the card benefits/rewards/cashback/points?,btohqsg
U mean buy UOB  DBS Share?,btohqsg
Trust link card or Cashback? Actually with link card paired to saving acct  does it still matters if u select savings or current?,btohqsg
The moment you link Trust Link card to savings account  it won't function like CC  so won't have any issues with it becoming cash advance.,btohqsg
