how is ur mt on avg?,btohqsg
bc a 'good grade' is different for everyone,btohqsg
tbvh whether a 'C' is good or not is for u to decide,btohqsg
Honestly mother tongue imo is either you are already smart enough to get A for it  or dont even bother trying,btohqsg
Because if iirc only A gives you the +1.25rp extra isnt it?,btohqsg
what u get for national exams is +1 or -1 grade from ur avg sch based exam grade,btohqsg
like for chinese i normally get A1-B3 in sch and i got A2 in the end for Os,btohqsg
Only if it helps u I think,btohqsg
and if u are taking ur chinese grade into account,btohqsg
But ya generally I heard it only +1 rp IF u get A,btohqsg
Then ofc Ur cl need a standard,btohqsg
AFAIK u clear the uni req all G,btohqsg
3 in 10 is that what u trying to say?,btohqsg
Ironically i think jc chinese is much easier than Os,btohqsg
Ok la I j1 tho so I can't say much abt that,btohqsg
But my ass was only focused on passing,btohqsg
literally the same situation as u,btohqsg
is it? i'd love to try jc chinese!,btohqsg
But ya aft this rly need focus on Ur other subjs,btohqsg
Doesnt have the cancerous ÁªºÂêà thingy from Os,btohqsg
I haven't experience JC cl yet,btohqsg
But my group memed the lecturer we damn mean oneüò≠,btohqsg
But only essay sect I think,btohqsg
i rly love jc chinese and cll but the other subjects stop me so i gave up the idea of even gg jc,btohqsg
U will take the written as 1 paper,btohqsg
I dont remember how i got through summary but its definitely not as brain wracking as zong he tian kong,btohqsg
