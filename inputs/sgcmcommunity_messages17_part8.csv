hardly find any manual car to buy in sg,btohqsg
"It really depends because school pass rate is higher  you're more likely to pass in one go. Many people do private but due to the lack of fixed lesson plans/""syllabus"" as such you can fail the test because private instructors tend to teach you more with the real world in mind. This is one factor that will change your cost.2. Private tends to be cheaper by a fair margin but then it is upto the instructor to decide when you are ready to take the test so they can take longer if greedy",btohqsg
2023 Toyota Corolla GR is what I am eagerly waiting to see,btohqsg
many dont know how to drive manual,btohqsg
And how old the car already?,btohqsg
All dependent on your preference  I personally chose CDC and did using the one team and I'm happy with their course  many of my friends have taken the same and are happy with it. All pass in one go,btohqsg
More about knowing how to and having the option  later you don't wanna get stuck with only auto then cannot buy/rent manual,btohqsg
Mr Arnav  you are a very clever man as we know. Are you sure you are not on the SGCM admin team?,btohqsg

HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THE FAMOUS AUNTY TROLLEY TEST?,btohqsg
So about like private  do you have to pay in one go for the whole thing or is it you can pay as you continue?,btohqsg

sgcarmart admin  take note. suggestion: when doing youtube videos  the person speaking should introduce himself.,btohqsg
Ignore cars which poke or smoke you. You have nothing to prove and you just want to get you and your occupants to the destination safely and in a chill manner.,btohqsg
during test also. Some drivers like to bully people with LL plates.,btohqsg
lucky my experience wasn't like this,btohqsg
ok rephrase.. some drivers just like to find people to bully.,btohqsg

so whatever happens  keep calm. breathe.,btohqsg
