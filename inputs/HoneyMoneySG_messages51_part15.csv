Content of the month: How much Salary is enough in Singapore (YouTube)Why I like this content: Salary is considered a taboo topic in Singapore due to cultural values of modesty  privacy  and avoiding comparison. Discussing income openly can be seen as boastful or disrespectful  and it may create feelings of inequality or conflict among colleagues. Many companies discourage salary discussions to promote unity and equal treatment. But I donâ€™t think this is the way forward.Statistics Update: 1 Jul 2023Years Active: 2 years  6 monthsIf you love my content  you can also support me for free by clicking on my Interactive Brokers Referral Link athttps://hmsg.link/ibkr  which pays a few pennies to my business.ðŸŽ¦ YouTube:https://youtube.com/c/HoneyMoneySGðŸ“¡ Telegram:https://t.me/honeymoneysgðŸ“· Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/honeymoneysgðŸ¤³ TikTok:https://www.tiktok.com/@honeymoneysgðŸ“™ Advanced Credit Card Mastery Course:https://hmsg.link/accm,btohqsg

The minister who said there was something called cheaper better faster is clearly delusional. Singapore is only expensive  slow or more expensive and slightly faster. Better is all subjective,btohqsg
