Give u guys summary. 100% correct- TNG card is not expired  even donâ€™t use for 2 years still valid. (Check the expiry date at the back of the card  small print)- no need my sejahtera apps at shopping. If need they will prepare paper and pen. Just fill in- coffee shop all donâ€™t need to check in. Free for all.- people are much nicer  smile more  maybe never see us for 2 years already. ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
