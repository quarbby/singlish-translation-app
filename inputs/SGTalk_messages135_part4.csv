U need to be more specific. Long hours in what ? Like run outside ? Shift work? If u just say long hours we assume like 12 hours vs 8 hours..,btohqsg
But if I work early  I won’t find it long hours le.Previous co can change working hours  so I chose 730-5pmMy colleague chose 7-430 Another aunty chose 630-4pm,btohqsg
Hmm 12 hours vs office hours,btohqsg
Oh flexi hours. Last time my company before covid can also but earliest I can reach is 830,btohqsg
I like it early. Start early  end early!,btohqsg
Hahah who likes to work longer ? I think most would rather work 4 hours less a day ba,btohqsg
Have to face customers face  cannot get angry.Have to smile  cannot talk back :(,btohqsg
