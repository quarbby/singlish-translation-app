I got another exam grp they say leave exact,btohqsg
dont leave exact for final ans,btohqsg
If cant express in fraction then leave in?,btohqsg
For e math ik dun leave exact,btohqsg
Like if it‚Äôs sqrt or pi,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you just tell your sqn that ‚Äòh7methstudent‚Äô is ur callsign,btohqsg
What's the benefit of taking MOE H3 math?,btohqsg
Primarily  H3s are for you to pursue an interest,btohqsg
So from H3  you‚Äôll know whether or not you would do maths in uni,btohqsg
And scholarship and unis look better at H3 kids  but locally rank point trumps all,btohqsg
If you want Cambridge  they also take a H3 merit as a H2 distinction,btohqsg
Guys remember for Bearings. If answer is only 2 digits. Then put a 0 behind it,btohqsg
Answer to Nearest cent$23.555 = $23.56,btohqsg
Answer to Nearest Ten Cents$23.555 = $23.60,btohqsg
Standard form qn might ask you to express answer in Millions. So cannot put √ó 10^6,btohqsg
when writing answers for the 1cm : 3km^2 type of qns  rmb to leave in exact if it is less than 5 digit  if more than 5 digits put 3sf but other qns if nvr state to leave in 2dp or wtv  leave it in 3sf. degrees also leave in 1d.p. unless they state to leave in 3sf or 2d.p,btohqsg
For every graph/line drawing also rmb to write down the graph equation,btohqsg
they wont test angle bisector construction right,btohqsg
Dont spend too much time on Graph also,btohqsg
ok so i want to ask  when im finding the equation of a straight line  if i sub the coordinates on the top of the line into the equation i get the answer,btohqsg
but if i sub the bottom one its wrong,btohqsg
Wht is the qn looking fot,btohqsg
usually u can use any point on the same line but gradient need to be same,btohqsg
i took two random coordinates to find the gradient,btohqsg
but when i sub the coordinate at the top into the y=mx+c i get the answer,btohqsg
the bottom coordinates doesn't give me the answer,btohqsg
Ur two coordinates are (0 6) and (1.2 0) Find gradient  first,btohqsg
Write down the equation y=mx+c with your gradient inside,btohqsg
Then sub in any of the 2 coordinates,btohqsg
i thought can use any coordinate,btohqsg
hmm maybe i do wrongly  i try again,btohqsg
IMO  the biggest benefit of H3 is for applying to UK universities  because it doesn't count towards rankpoints anyway,btohqsg
So basically u know C is Y int of line right?,btohqsg
The line intersects y axis at 6,btohqsg
Therefore making ur eqn of the line y=-5x+6,btohqsg
ohh but i still need find the gradient first right,btohqsg
When u sub in coordinates into the eqn it is to find the other coordinates if im not wrong,btohqsg
But in this case u alr know both coordinates,btohqsg
Oh ya also rmb this.1. When 2 lines are parallel  gradient of both lines are the same2. When 2 lines are overlapping and parallel  equation and gradient is the same3. If 2 lines are intersecting and you want to find the coordinates of the Intersection point. Solve by Simulataneous Equation.4. If two lines are perpendicular to each other. (Gradient Of Line 1) √ó (Gradient Of Line 2) = -1,btohqsg
how do i solve by simultaneons,btohqsg
Form two equations lemme take a pic,btohqsg
Form 2 equations. One of them make it into y=... or x=... then the second eqn just write down the eqn they gave u,btohqsg
Quite manageable though can spot topics :),btohqsg
all the best dude!!! did u study for geog alr?,btohqsg
Eh anybody here know how to study for e math paper 2,btohqsg
I for real dk what to study at this point,btohqsg
jus go thru the tys recents ones,btohqsg
dont do just like go thru all like come out w the steps liddat den if uk den ok if udk refer to ans sheet?,btohqsg
Read thru ur past Paper 2 Homework. Rmb the formulas for Cone etc. See thru ur Corrections,btohqsg
Only study the ones that haven‚Äôt been tested btw,btohqsg
is number sequence likely to come out for p2 again?,btohqsg
since p1 it was tested but that one was quite easy,btohqsg
If come out p2 will be more diff,btohqsg
Prolly need To Explain why the nth term expression is Odd Number,btohqsg
Or something like 2019 one the 4 row thing,btohqsg
And ur math set might ask u draw bisectors,btohqsg
And rmb ur circle properties atb to all,btohqsg
do u guys think quadratic sequences are likely to come out?,btohqsg
last yr didnt come out though,btohqsg
Can vary to volume to trigo,btohqsg
But that one just use form eqn,btohqsg
Lol tbh a math is good cause u can use it for e math,btohqsg
last time a math compulsory for my sch lol,btohqsg
Log can be used for some qns lol,btohqsg
to prove the formula is eg n^2+2nuse the formula :a+d(n-1)+ c/2 (n-1)(n-2),btohqsg
to get the formula of the pattern cn use the calculator u get one tbh,btohqsg
Inneevr really use a math lol,btohqsg
i only use the eqn of the line lol,btohqsg
Bleh see tdy p2 good to us or they dont like us,btohqsg
cn^2 + bn + a rite sometimes dh cn^2 or a oneso for casio calculator use mode 2 3 den u key in for the x column 1 2 3 4 if have 4 terms den the y column key in the number of the termsafter that u go shift  1 den press 5<reg> den u press for c and b and a respectively,btohqsg
hope they dont give those qns tht needs to visualize ü•¥,btohqsg
but those need use alot brain cells i-,btohqsg
if the weather hot rite i rlly cnnt think cjdjxbs,btohqsg
im depending on my math mt and poa for a1üòñ,btohqsg
Aiya later b4 start u go pray and splash water around u then see hiw bah,btohqsg
humans pls be gud to me idw tectonic plates sia,btohqsg
At least thats my game plan here,btohqsg
my mt pass can alr cos i screw up my oral,btohqsg
i got a1 so one subj downüí™üèª going stong,btohqsg
issok ir mt results shall go to ur othrr subj,btohqsg
its my r5 subj but i wanna go poly,btohqsg
i didnt grow up in sg üòÇ,btohqsg
bow down to the chinese god,btohqsg
the first 10 mcq is from the highlighted words frm textbook,btohqsg
if u nvr see the words before means its not,btohqsg
its ok i felt like i might fail but still did decently,btohqsg
I got the most common grade across sg,btohqsg
then the compre is normaly first qns forst para de,btohqsg
But like my chinese in sch usually C5 range,btohqsg
yeah same :/ actually quite surprising for me tho,btohqsg
last qns just give storylike write compo liddat cn alr,btohqsg
its jus i went to sch in china in pri sch soü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
the pri 1 thr cn do sg pri 6 chinese paper,btohqsg
I got a friend from china her chinese is insane,btohqsg
pri 4 cn do sec 4 bah,btohqsg
Cant understand here cuase of her godly chinese,btohqsg
i go write my fren jc compo cb i wrote 400 words oni my fren jus pass Hahaha coz i lazy,btohqsg
yea i cant compare w them la,btohqsg
but ualls r eng god to meüòñ,btohqsg
Its ok enuf for sec 4,btohqsg
yea HAHAHHA can survive cn alr,btohqsg
2hrs to going to exam room,btohqsg
i not studying for math alr,btohqsg
i need to chill my shit down,btohqsg
I am preparing my holy water,btohqsg
ltr u need go toilet during exam cb HAHHA,btohqsg
no i retain 1 year ah,btohqsg
haha yesis not like no one goes to the toilet during exam,btohqsg
aeis is like mcq but my grammer n vocab was weak that time soo,btohqsg
Aiya its ok ah practice can liao,btohqsg
Explain why n is odd integer is just extracting common factors right,btohqsg
Just say since they are all divisible by 3 it is odd,btohqsg
Yea u can opt to show,btohqsg
So then u can say therefore after that blah blah blah,btohqsg
like 3n^2 + 6n + 3   3 can be factorized out to 3(n^2+2n +1) hence it is a multiple of 3,btohqsg
And therefore all of n is odd,btohqsg
My main worry is the graph question though,btohqsg
if they ask me draw tangent all those,btohqsg
Idk how to draw the new graph,btohqsg
Like if they give a third equation,btohqsg
my prelim the graph i got 0,btohqsg
Then you have to draw the new graph using the new equation,btohqsg
My school mixed the graph with the real world application,btohqsg
so u cn see the intersection,btohqsg
Ye but I have trouble finding the coordinates,btohqsg
Yea real world with graph is a killer,btohqsg
Cuase ur graph wrong ur whole thing wrong lol,btohqsg
They preping u for this Os,btohqsg
One guy drew an a math graph for some reason,btohqsg
They‚Äôll usually give a chart right,btohqsg
What are the terms that you need to be familiar with,btohqsg
den u get ur chargavle income,btohqsg
dat one just use common sense bro,btohqsg
monthly income x 12 minus tax rebate,btohqsg
then u get ur chatgable income,btohqsg
ur chargavle income need see the table,btohqsg
So chargeable become equals to monthly income times 12,btohqsg
Then the whole thing minus rebate,btohqsg
That‚Äôs all that you need to know for chargeable income questions?,btohqsg
annual income minus tax relief is ur CI,btohqsg
The graph he drew is one from a math syllabus,btohqsg
He thought the school set a math question in the prelim to make the students struggle,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt get full marks for the paper 2 cause of that question,btohqsg
Well too bad cos it‚Äôs almost certainly going to come out for most of section c lol,btohqsg
i mean its out of syllabus haha,btohqsg
Welp later see the paper 2 how many vectors qns,btohqsg
And probably will test PT lorms,btohqsg
So must memorise PT like mad,btohqsg
i havent even started thats the prob,btohqsg
I started PT W&C and Tourism,btohqsg
Food haven‚Äôt even touch yet lmao,btohqsg
memorise for Prelim but i forgot liao haha,btohqsg
But this one would probably only have like 5 marks or less to memorise since they‚Äôre probably testing hybrid for section c,btohqsg
paper 1 minus 7 marks sia,btohqsg
If not need memorise so much,btohqsg
last yr ossue 2 for ss came out,btohqsg
so imma jus study issue 1&3,btohqsg
den isue 2 i jua read thru,btohqsg
sd and interwuatile got unit rite,btohqsg
My teacher told me dat there‚Äôs gonna be vectors in p 2 also,btohqsg
will see in 2h time üòÇ,btohqsg
how many of u planning go jc,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall have elect geography and math on the same day,btohqsg
If i single digit then yes,btohqsg
if i 12 below den yes,btohqsg
Cause it was already 7m in paper 1,btohqsg
They were asked dis morning to prepare d clt paper,btohqsg
If there isn‚Äôt then can afford to lose note marks,btohqsg
not really haha considering my humans just pass and my eng really cmi üòÇ,btohqsg
Geography I‚Äôm in no position to say anything,btohqsg
ss jus need infer correctly but,btohqsg
past yrs ss all ok tbh,btohqsg
yeh but i misinterpret the source so...,btohqsg
i mean w&c everyone do damnn wellk,btohqsg
Honestly if your skills are sound... you have some general knowledge and the content revise,btohqsg
Plus learn the bias check format,btohqsg
Unless if the paper is dang difficult,btohqsg
thats uhm too out of my range,btohqsg
i normally 5/7 for the hybrid qns,btohqsg
Guys if the School collapse halfway during the paper everyonr passes right,btohqsg
Because my SS is usually around 30,btohqsg
Then for my practice papers that I sent to my Cher I suddenly got 47/50,btohqsg
just got like 27 for my prelim cos i misinterpret 2 sources haha soz,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for real not that chsllenging,btohqsg
coz i nvr memorise that one,btohqsg
it‚Äôs for real not that difficult...,btohqsg
Just learn how to do bias check,btohqsg
i memo the one infront n behind if that particular topic LOL,btohqsg
i still suck n seeing which is buas which is not like ik la but still,btohqsg
some magazine like times r not biased also,btohqsg
Does the author have any ulterior motive? Does only he stand to gain from this ulterior motive,btohqsg
And unless if it‚Äôs assertion or a 7 mark non-hybrid question,btohqsg
cross ref oni for hybrid rite,btohqsg
Normally every year they test at least 10 marks vector for both paper 1 and 2 tho,btohqsg
The only year in the Tys without vector in paper 2 I could see is 2016,btohqsg
highest for me 5/7 i happy alr lmao,btohqsg
shall see some of u in my future sch yes,btohqsg
we shld go out aft os,btohqsg
Play through December to cry in January,btohqsg
Bruh no such thing for me sia,btohqsg
tears of joy / tears of regret,btohqsg
Unles they say leave in pie or other?,btohqsg
btw u cn go shift mode then press 7,btohqsg
They need to say interms of pie i thjnk,btohqsg
then u choose how many SI u wn,btohqsg
mayb like the ans is 32827,btohqsg
u press 7 den 3 lor,btohqsg
barely hv ppl ise curve ruler,btohqsg
sec 1 sec 2 all usedje after that,btohqsg
im sure im not the only one the free hand draw graph?,btohqsg
Yea got people learn that way also,btohqsg
Both is fine as long as its smooth ig,btohqsg
if dh fraction den u 3sf,btohqsg
they can ask u to leave in terms of pi,btohqsg
If never specify then 3sf uh,btohqsg
Try mixed number b4 u 3sf,btohqsg
if it can be a mix number,btohqsg
if its like cnnt change to mixed,btohqsg
just like leave your workings all in pi first then the last step then convert to 3sf or something liddat,btohqsg
if workings cn use 4sf or 5sf,btohqsg
so if speed is like 23 2/3 then leav it in frac right,btohqsg
Just dont anyhow 3sf can liao,btohqsg
bearings rmb must alw 3 digits yaaa,btohqsg
thr was once i blank out,btohqsg
oni cold brew and nitro cold brew works on me,btohqsg
3 digits as in like this,btohqsg
If nice nice then no need 1 dp,btohqsg
Later he got deci dont care the deci,btohqsg
listen to math explanation god ck,btohqsg
1 dp when u got deci,btohqsg
U got mixed then mix lor,btohqsg
my sch the 8 gods sitting tgt,btohqsg
u wait next yr the 6distinctions ^ all come out,btohqsg
the other god like dont talk to them one siaeng compo write 4-5 pagesü•¥,btohqsg
i write 2 pages also my max alr  o lvls i wrote like the first part filled up the second oage 3/4,btohqsg
i alr vomit everyth i lesrnt for eng out alr,btohqsg
my sw forever longer than compo sia,btohqsg
for prwc qns  if selling things right  how much to up the price?,btohqsg
depend on how much profit u want to earn?,btohqsg
A type of real world wns,btohqsg
if i put profit $2 will they still accept,btohqsg
1 more hour to go good luck to all,btohqsg
Rmb to have a math set,btohqsg
i bring compass ruler and protractor only lol,btohqsg
i nvr bring my long ruler,btohqsg
u have urh 30 mins to slp now XD,btohqsg
issok i anxiety den i go buy sushi at my canteen,btohqsg
i dou alr gd night haha,btohqsg
i ate like 8 pieces of sushiüòñ,btohqsg
im like hungry but haha i didnt buy food to eat üòÇ,btohqsg
haha im not even in exam venue yet,btohqsg
See paper then we say haha,btohqsg
Gl and rmb to breath after looking at the paper,btohqsg
I mean after u see paper might get shocked,btohqsg
tell urself the paper no kick and enjoy the paper,btohqsg
i will slp when i receive my paper üôÉ,btohqsg
and wake up when th time starts,btohqsg
where u could possibly find a free ecopy of hp philosopher‚Äôs stone,btohqsg
cuz i forgot to bring my book out and im nt done reading it,btohqsg
But if whole number just leave it,btohqsg
Angle 1dp but with 3 digit in front,btohqsg
If whole number just leave it,btohqsg
Yes. If 60 degree where will be 060 iirc,btohqsg
with regards to how they mark papers,btohqsg
You just aiming for C6 for e-math? Just taking Paper 1 haha,btohqsg
I think his account is hacked,btohqsg
Why are u not in exam,btohqsg
what time do they end pp2 ah?,btohqsg
what did u get for the graph last question,btohqsg
Or all usual type came out?,btohqsg
what did u get for the graph last ques???,btohqsg
errr i think it was 6? ans 5.9?,btohqsg
i took 2 pieces of full scap to check,btohqsg
den the cher jus look at m like wtf,btohqsg
what's the answer u guys got for the real life question,btohqsg
Choose which one for the exchange,btohqsg
i nvr out the .02 cents,btohqsg
Should exchange more money for the child right,btohqsg
coz i say its a more convenient amount,btohqsg
So u take the highest for realworld?,btohqsg
cos cos like to be safe ma,btohqsg
eg u wn give other ppl money,btohqsg
uw the exchange rate hugh wat,btohqsg
So jessica whats ur final ans,btohqsg
i think 12k?? smth ard thr,btohqsg
i finish tht qns then i check others alr,btohqsg
I got like 0.582/3 for the thing,btohqsg
in case like the exchange rate drop,btohqsg
lmao i at first take all then divide by 24 then i cancel away,btohqsg
Its ok that one is like,btohqsg
the child still get SAME AMOUNT,btohqsg
Aiya fuck the last one ah,btohqsg
I give 6 marks the rest die die must be correct,btohqsg
aiya let‚Äôs study for this friday and next week de stuff,btohqsg
Aight time to study for lc,btohqsg
let‚Äôs not dwell on this HAHAH,btohqsg
angle at circum and the angle at cnetre rule,btohqsg
