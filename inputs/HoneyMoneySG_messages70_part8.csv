Hi  I have a SCB Journey card  is it better to use it for overseas spending (2mpd  no foreign currency FX fee but probably worse exchange rates) or to stick with multicurrency cards like youtrip (better exchange rate bit no miles)?I can't seem to find a way to see SCB foreign currency rates to compare them with youtrip.,btohqsg
No FCY fee only in Nov/DecThe rate is same as Visa exchange rate (since Journey is Visa)Note: you‚Äôll be charged FCY fee first  and then after a few weeks you‚Äôll receive the FCY fee rebate.,btohqsg
Yes  I am only travelling in novso I am trying to compare it to multicurrency cards  will go and look at visa exchange rates thanks,btohqsg

anyone knows whats the spread on moomoo for sgd to usd? i currently have my money in choco finance for 4.5% PA but not sure if its worth converting to usd in moomoo to subscribe to their USD cash plus for about 5% PA,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the best bank for a teenager that doesn‚Äôt have large large cash? currently using dbs but sick of it crashing,btohqsg
i have two accounts but under posb dbs,btohqsg
See reference rates. Can always compare around with banks etc before changing.,btohqsg
Depends on what you intend to use the bank account for ü§î e.g savings consistently   spending or etc.,btohqsg
looking for one to have as savings  one as a daily spendings account,btohqsg
and i‚Äôm also looking to do my own startup as a side hustle so also wondering which bank i shld use for that,btohqsg
Scb jumpstart gives 2% interest without any criteria to fulfil,btohqsg
Can consider trust bank for side hustle if the startup requires foreign currency transactions etc.,btohqsg
calculated a little bit. currency conversion seems to cost about 0.4% each time in moomoo compared to XE currency converter rates.so for 2x conversion (to convert to usd and convert back to sgd when cashing out)  it would cost about 0.8% total. wouldnt really be worth it considering choco finance has guaranteed 4.5%,btohqsg

Anyone got do fixed USD deposit in DBS bank? Tempting... Atleast 5% interest,btohqsg
It says accumulate by 16 Oct 1559. System won‚Äôt instantly buy into the funds yet. Also cant do it manually  only is to subscribe. One trading day plus one more day then it will add to the funds. So likely is on Wednesday morning.,btohqsg
u do now then when ur FD matures and USD drop.... you're back to square one in SGD perspective,btohqsg
I think i better ask webull tomorrow for those who subscribe on 16/10 but only added fund on 18/10  still will get the 120 usd cash voucher or not.,btohqsg
Anyone knows how changipay transactions will be recorded in terms of mcc,btohqsg
Very real issue lol. Unless u buy stocks or something with the USD.,btohqsg
The short answer is the money you put into your Chocolate account is not safe from capital losses. However  for the long answer  you need to understand these 3 things:1. Any money you put into your Chocolate account (capital) is then invested into a portfolio of fixed-income funds designed to optimise risk-adjusted returns based on duration  spread  and currency.2. Markets do go up and down and so will the portfolio value. For balances below S$20k  if the value of your portfolio is lower than your capital at any given point in time  Chocolate will top up the shortfall (on both losses incurred on capital and target returns) so you earn the 4.5% p.a. returns on your total balance. I.e: This means  while the qualifying period is live  your capital sum for balances below S$20k won't go down. Read the details for the top-up terms and conditions.3. All funds invested with Chocolate are segregated and held separately by custodians. This means if anything happens to Chocolate - your money is still safe. Think of this like a safe inside a house on fire. Stuff inside the safe is still safe. Only the balancing item will not remain safe (and this is why we can't say your capital is guaranteed).,btohqsg
