Hi guys . I just accepted a order for tmrw . But seem like I got 2 orders at same timing.  Is it possible to cancle 1 of the order ?,btohqsg
alternatively  ask someone to do for you. For the order that the other person is doing  that person will need to login your account to swipe pickup and take picture. The key importance is for the GPS to detect the pickup pin drop so that u dont get love letter,btohqsg
Want to do then pm..if dont want...or think not worth..then just mind own business dont need talk much.,btohqsg
Both of u serve a purpose...in the corporate world  one's an employer while the other is UnionðŸ¤­ðŸ˜€,btohqsg

Hey  looks like I'll be stopping full-time Lalamove for now. Found a job and I'll be starting on 1 December. Thanks for the sharing and I benefit greatly from all the sharing here. I sincerely wish all of you the best  and most importantly  stay safe as a Lalamove driver. I'll still do one or two Lalamove deliveries once a month because I want to keep that 20% fuel discount. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Finally  do go to MyCareersFuture website. That's where I found my job. The government will even pay you $3800 if you work under SGUP program. So if you are doing LLM as an interim solution  go there now.,btohqsg
