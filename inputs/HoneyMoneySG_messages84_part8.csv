HiWas doing some reading on cpf shielding..Can I check what happen if the RA is maxed at ERS  are we able to transfer OA to SA then?,btohqsg
Once 55 you cannot transfer OA to SA. CPF shielding is done before RA is formed.,btohqsg
So mainly after yr55 what goes to OA will be there till retirement? RA can be only top up by SA account?,btohqsg
You can transfer OA/SA to RA if you haven't hit ERS. Or you can withdraw the monies if you hit FRS.,btohqsg
Meant that if reach 55  ur SA will top up RA to FRS only and then u can choose OA/SA to top to ERS?If this case  cpf shielding is not impt unless OA got alot of money,btohqsg
anyone with hsbc revo card ? when does the bonus point get credited ?,btohqsg

Back to the credit card  but need to wait for the quarter to finish,btohqsg
For eg if your 3 month quarter is jan feb mar  the rebate will be in apr statement,btohqsg
Assuming you hit $500 ofeligiblespending for 3 consecutive months (Oct to Dec)  the cashback is automatically credited to the card end Dec.,btohqsg
Would the cashback be stated in the dec credit card statement in this case?,btohqsg
Ok.For RA to be ERS  should it be done earlier rather compared reach age 65 then max? Whether will impact the monthly payout?,btohqsg
Yes you'll see it +$50 (or more),btohqsg
Up to you.. they will payout based on how much you have at that point of time. So even if you top-up RA after 65  you will get more payouts.RA is 4.08% p.a. so the interest is pretty good.,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips.Understand the methodology behind cpf shielding. But ultimately still depends whether I got how much OA when reach 55üòÇ,btohqsg
It's whether you want to keep more in OA growing at 2.5% or SA growing at 4.08%..,btohqsg
