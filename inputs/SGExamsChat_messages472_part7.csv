I think there’s a very clear reason why. It’s 1800 for a year lol,btohqsg
I want to do a platform because it is the only way I can help students on FAS scheme for a very low cost,btohqsg
My idea is to upsell people who already believe in physical tuition centers to receive progress and updates in an automated fashion,btohqsg
currently I am not in a position to help much. Previously they also may not be able to afford digital devices.Now with govt push on personal learning device  I think it is time to go for it,btohqsg
That should just be a 100 dollar upsell per student per course or something  not 1800 and all tuition is replaced,btohqsg
Or even 100 and all subjects have automated reports sent to parents and analysis for student improvement,btohqsg
For them they have no physical footprint and no way to motivate the person attending,btohqsg
This is a good idea to add to my implementation. I will think how I can fit in though seriously I not sure if it will take off at all.,btohqsg
The interesting part about this is that it’s like how real software works also  because you become dependent on it and your tuition center achieves lock in effect.,btohqsg
I mean  if your income doesnt derive from the platform  then it is okay.,btohqsg
You incentivize parents to send for more classes under your brand because Aiya i already pay for analytics package might as well send all subjects to your center,btohqsg
You can look at alot of digital platform. A lot of examples in the market on what they sell and how they sell.,btohqsg
Plus once they familiarize themselves with your approach others will need to overcome the mental hurdle of doing it with another platform,btohqsg
I saw. Platforms like 88tuition did not even realise there was a syllabus change for S3 I think,btohqsg
Can’t rely on a purely digital delivery model  needs a mix,btohqsg
Education is deeply physical and in person even with the best digital tools,btohqsg
yes  I have this idea which is not purely digital,btohqsg
Education is still effective in person. If one can study online  there are tons of resources free online. Why would one still need to pay for something else.,btohqsg
To be fair university students can do it but these are A level and below,btohqsg
Because there are too many resources online  and confusion comes when trying to find out which one is applicable,btohqsg
many university students hate it tho,btohqsg
Sorry to disturb this very tech based convo,btohqsg
It's like learning investing.There are tons of resources free online  but it is faster to go for a specialised course,btohqsg
Tuition is part time nanny and part time academic accelerator too  some children just need guidance to actually study,btohqsg
I mean if someone bothers to search online  i dont see it a reason not to find the applicable one and check with their school teacher.,btohqsg
Shld i talk abt my family background when talking abt,btohqsg
A why ____ company interview qn,btohqsg
Ok  im out. Too much booming. =),btohqsg
If 10 websites all say they are applicable. But no mention which one follows the updated syllabus and stuff?,btohqsg
Interviewers are not charity social workers,btohqsg
Don’t mention your family at all lol,btohqsg
What’s the background of the company,btohqsg
Management consultancy is all about image,btohqsg
But i get whr u cmin frm,btohqsg
Keep it professional is what I mean,btohqsg
there are ways to mention the family background if relevant without explicitly mentioning,btohqsg
Only if they ask then you share and don’t over share,btohqsg
It's always about what you have that is applicable and useful  and not your background story,btohqsg
Just think about their side - they have 10 other candidates who have similar pedigrees to you,btohqsg
What sets you apart? Motivation  skill  how you present and carry yourself  your ideas?,btohqsg
Unless your dad is maybe president of Indonesia,btohqsg
What can you offer to the company? When you are young  it is always about time and energy and knowledge of market. When you are experienced  well  it is about relevant experience so they can kick start you asap.,btohqsg
If you mention “my father has half a billion in financial asset management contacts”  then can talk family,btohqsg
But if not  keep it professional,btohqsg
I mean the only time you can rly bring up family is if they’re a big success in some field and somehow it inspires you to join them,btohqsg
Like maybe your dad is a management leader at a big firm,btohqsg
And I doubt that’s the case for most people,btohqsg
if this one true you probs don’t even need to interview to get a role somewhere lmao,btohqsg
If your family is so good  maybe you can consider working back to your family.,btohqsg
Their management not exactly stellar track record,btohqsg
