MSCP chargers are slow chargers. Mostly AC. So they will be hours till 80%.There are other ways to get your charging sorted. DC charging at other places takes like 30-45 mins to 80-90%,btohqsg

Mostly if you get Long range variants yeah.,btohqsg
After work  go mall plug DC charger. Go eat food. By then done liao,btohqsg
Or just charge the next day after a good rest...but in the first place I seldom charge when below 50 since I can charge wherever I go,btohqsg
Difficult if got work or appt,btohqsg
Nvr pump fuel the next day,btohqsg
Always do it before u go homeüòÇ,btohqsg
Dont WAIT TILL THE NEXT DAY!,btohqsg
Easy ah no need to over think .. just keep enough at least to make the distance from home to work and back.Cause if cannot make it back from either way can just go to a DC charger and fast charge it to 80% which would be more than enough for another week or two.,btohqsg

Reminds me of port dickson once.. drove to a petrol stn.. 10km range.. went there say we dont have 97.. ask me go further up the road. Was so prepared to push car alr.. traffic light there horrendous..,btohqsg
At that point just ask the station manager to give you enough 95 to get to the next station üòÇ,btohqsg

Not really. Investment long term or over a period of time.Gambling is more of instant gratification.,btohqsg
Still have to gamble mah whether it‚Äôll go up or down,btohqsg
Investment is - putting a sum of money for the future but with a slightly lower risk compared to gambling.Gambling is - short term,btohqsg
Thats why buy stocks and sell fast is gambling vs Buying and holding,btohqsg
i only heard people say invest invest  sekali the logic very simple  lose money keep till it go up then sell,btohqsg
cannot sell is called invest  coz like we say  lose money,btohqsg
haolian say paper loss  tomorrow will be better,btohqsg

Invest need to have knowledge on when to cut loss  take profits  and rebalance portfolio. Without these knowledge  yah it's gambling with luck,btohqsg
The above is simply buy and pray it hit jackpot  much like buying toto or 4d.,btohqsg
After some consideration  I might go for a Honda Freed Hybrid over the Vezel/HR-V (RU) Hybrid,btohqsg
I just have a bit of a dislike seeing the latter so common in the roads.,btohqsg
Most common IIRC would be Honda Vezel/HRV,btohqsg
I see about 20-50 of them as I commute back home,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs the most common car before the HRV/Vezel aka the definitive Grab SUV.,btohqsg
