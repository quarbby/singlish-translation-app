whats the difference between a report and a journal and a blog post,btohqsg

Anyone here gone through the PFP route for Poly? Im currently in PFP and im quite worried that im gonna be kicked out because i didnâ€™t do well for Math ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
which poly are you studying in rn,btohqsg
But don't you keep ur place in pfp as long as you pass everything?,btohqsg
if you fail one module youâ€™re out,btohqsg
im worried i failed math lol  i got lucky with a B3 in N Level despite failing math from Sec 1 to 4,btohqsg
so i got into PFP and my classmates mostly took O-level math while my math is pretty bad,btohqsg
I mean the semester is going to end soon,btohqsg
So if you are sure that you are going to fail the math module  i think its a good idea to start looking for alternative education options,btohqsg
Its too late to drastically change your module grades now imo  im not sure how the module is graded,btohqsg
nah dw bout it just keep doing ur best,btohqsg
If there is a final exam  maybe you can,btohqsg
i ended the semester already  my results are coming out in 1.5 months time,btohqsg
ive got a 2 months holiday,btohqsg
im not sure if im gonna fail because i heard borderline fail would be pushed up to a pass as most schools want a 100% pass rate for PFP,btohqsg
I hate presentation back when I touch pfp,btohqsg
my marks probably in the 43-55 marks range so idk if itâ€™s considered borderline  this is gonna be stressing me out for 2 whole months ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Well that's abit more to Passing,btohqsg
im doing business so have math  i canâ€™t change course also,btohqsg
