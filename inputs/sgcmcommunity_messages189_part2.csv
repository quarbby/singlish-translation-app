Honda CR-V 1.5 Turbo 7-Seater ReviewThough lacking in material flair  the CR-V quietly charms as the rare family-SUV that emphasises the driver's experience as much as that of its occupants.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Alternative to SUVs that you can consider. But prices stated in the article may differ already.,btohqsg
For FWD cars  if i change the rear tyres only  still need to do alignment?,btohqsg
Depends on the type of suspension. Iirc  torsion beam cannot be aligned.,btohqsg
For a new car  10km\L is quite terrible. The reviewer is being very PC by calling the FC 'Average Fuel Economy' 🙃,btohqsg
to be having a 1.5 litre engine for its sizze,btohqsg
Yes I agree  it is a cat B car  they could give it 2L or even bring in the hybrid variant  dunno why kah motor insist on the 1.5L ICE model,btohqsg
now all new car engine small size,btohqsg
By right should be like this  but given the size and weight of this SUV it should be like 2L or more. If not 1.8 with hybrid power train?,btohqsg
1.5L with turbo is like joke lol,btohqsg
It works on civic but not on heavier SUV like the CRV,btohqsg
Kah motor is pricing it at $267k lol. Like that Mazda or Toyota can offer better powered car,btohqsg
Can even get a entry level SUVs from the German manufacturers,btohqsg
Ya. can get Merc GLB  Tiguan and Audi Q3 also,btohqsg
Kah Motor has been shooting in the foot,btohqsg
Yes sir . And manual oso,btohqsg
More COE supply incoming for upcoming quarterThe LTA has announced that COE supply is set to rise across all car categories for the quarter from February to April 2024.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 More quota coming~,btohqsg
Isn’t it too early? Shouldn’t they release more supply just before election?,btohqsg
Or they will release even more supply all the way to election?,btohqsg
They only release for the next quarter (3 months)  so the end of the year one still TBC,btohqsg
Ya ..my 1.8 still have 11-12 km ..I think because of turbo.. if you want car to last long don’t buy turbo ..,btohqsg
But turbo don’t rev more than 2k RPM  won’t kick in  no meh?,btohqsg
nowadays lots of turbos start lower than that. VW engines kick in at 1.5k iirc,btohqsg
I think mine kicks in at 2k only,btohqsg
If 1.5k kick in  go up slope sure kick in easily. Like that keep on engaging in that rpm not v good for engine,btohqsg
https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/international-automotive-scene/175473-vw-s-next-gen-1-5l-tsi-engine.htmlseems this one claims 1.3k  but idk if true,btohqsg
Actually maybe 2k plus? Can feel the boost only at higher revs,btohqsg

That is what I read about the nishan QQ 1.2 variant. Every little bit engage the turbo  so wear out faster,btohqsg
i like to put it this way.. a 1.5 car maybe has 120bhp.. if u use 100bhp.. its about 83% engine usage.. a 2.0 car maybe has 170bhp.. if same load and conditions u use 100bhp.. its only 60% usage.. so which 1 wear out faster..,btohqsg

Weird... insurance suppose to cover. Especially if its financed,btohqsg
But he cant buy a new car cus no one wanna cover,btohqsg
I think his loss over 250k leh based on market price,btohqsg
And he at fault cant even claim the other party,btohqsg
High risk. Insurance made a big loss by insuring him.,btohqsg
Red flag. No other insurance will want to take e risk,btohqsg
Just like no insurance want to insure Jackie Chan,btohqsg
