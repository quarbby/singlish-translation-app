next month i also that kind of timing,btohqsg
ya bro..see till my eyes pop out,btohqsg
other ppl mod lancer look like evo  you mod your A7 look like RS7,btohqsg
I really like the A7 cos of the fastback design,btohqsg
yeah i like A7 alot as well,btohqsg
if i had one  i would like a wagon,btohqsg
i find wagons like hard to parkcos looks longer haha,btohqsg
your car should already be quite long right,btohqsg
just the feeling wagon are long haha,btohqsg
i forgot which one i sat in before  not sure was it A5 or A6 sportback  but it was fast,btohqsg
its fast.. but still i see some cars here i think theirs are faster,btohqsg
probably can only do well in handling,btohqsg
2.0 is good enough for sg road,btohqsg
just enjoy own ride and not to race or speed can le,btohqsg
we do up the car towards our own taste and liking de,btohqsg
i like how when friends and family who used to drive jdm sit in the car,btohqsg
their the ones who appreciate it most,btohqsg
no point to race or dare each other..more to let each other admire each other rides and give advise on how to do up the car with much trail and error as here have many master who we can learn from one and other,btohqsg
friendly culture is the best :),btohqsg
and where to eat good prata,btohqsg
i think that's what i will have for lunch,btohqsg
i cant eat prata for lunch.. too heavy,btohqsg
i prefer to have it for breakfast or supper,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1087060Once again just spreading the word gents! Anyone knows of someone looking to buy a swift. Left 9yrs 8.6k depre. No dekit. Do PM me.,btohqsg
but then again i'm the kind will choose bread over noodles and noodles over rice,btohqsg
speaking of car culture  i saw how some people spoiled last Friday's meet at Kallang. really smh,btohqsg
But pepperoni is good shit too,btohqsg
missed it as i went up north,btohqsg
after the orginiser asked everyone to leave,btohqsg
the meet went downhill damn fast,btohqsg
the rev battle went out of control,btohqsg
families buying mcd drivethru cannot move,btohqsg
those fellers are just idiots la,btohqsg
yeah... omg its really a crazy scene,btohqsg
if their in here i hope they read this,btohqsg
everyone just stuck at the road just revving,btohqsg
but you have to blame the kids running around also,btohqsg
they are the ones asking ppl to rev,btohqsg
Some asked me  i point middle finger at them,btohqsg
best is we stick to our own event,btohqsg
the feller will learn his lesson,btohqsg
happening but in the wrong way. finally a big meet for everyone to get together and there has to be these people that wanna show off and gain attention,btohqsg
revving engine only heats the car up with no cooling,btohqsg
actually the cooling depends on what you've done to the car,btohqsg
adding a fan switch can get the radiator fan's running,btohqsg
if anyone remembers the one at changi exhibition just before Covid. that was good,btohqsg
no matter what you done  your car not moving got no cool air coming in,btohqsg
radiator fan can only do so much,btohqsg
the gtr paing in msia i think after the meetup,btohqsg
because just reving not much load,btohqsg
even when you dyno car also got 1 big fan feeding air into your car,btohqsg
but you going up to redline ma,btohqsg
it's still generating alot of heat,btohqsg
thats why when you pull and just rev the sound different,btohqsg
atleast dyno your wheel is spinning,btohqsg
revving but wheel not moving that increase air pressure load to endine,btohqsg
like when you install a silencer on the car  on the road i couldn't get pass 4k  but at idle i could go to 5k easily,btohqsg
that will damange your piston and engne,btohqsg
btw don't add silencers lol it really affects,btohqsg
unless got a specific reason to do so,btohqsg
the previous exhaust i was experimenting on different silencers....  Its not the solution,btohqsg
isit because your exhaust is loud thats why you need silencer?,btohqsg
something you put inside the exhaust ah,btohqsg
yeah i got tired of it,btohqsg
usually is screw in at the back,btohqsg
i also tried one that went inbetween the midpipe,btohqsg
it does but your top end performance is affected,btohqsg
hmmm okie... i finding a exhuast that are not too loud yet nice buzzing sound for my car,btohqsg
anyone tried adding a bov to a car that comes stock without? will experience more lag ma?,btohqsg
you need to ask in your own audi groups,btohqsg
i liked the supersprint my friend had but i need to sit in the car again to know for sure,btohqsg
need to spend some time in it to be sure,btohqsg
my previous exhaust sounds fucking nice.... but tiring to drive,btohqsg
yeah.. i also not in a hurry to change my exhaust also,btohqsg
I didn’t study hard. That why sigh,btohqsg
study hard also no use one la,btohqsg
Hey hey i was busy ok,btohqsg
They ask me rev I just ignore 😂😂,btohqsg
Not recommended for stock set up  at least must stage 1,btohqsg
that why to be honest  end of the day a mega meet is one way to die one   private meet like this shot here if cfm best way to go one,btohqsg
They at there ask ppl rev  wont tio daiji. But we drivers will.,btohqsg
next time got meet come ah   private meet one,btohqsg
you check google drive now  should be in le,btohqsg
Japanese RWD sports cars are the best,btohqsg
