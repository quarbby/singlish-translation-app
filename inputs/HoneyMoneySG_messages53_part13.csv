I would suggest you get rid of yourself from existence not only from this group,btohqsg
If 182% return this person won't be telling any one of us. obvious scam,btohqsg
think don't waste time on this person. we just click on his comment and report.,btohqsg
Oh and I made a mistake  it's 1820% a year 😂. I thought 182% was bad enough.,btohqsg
How long is the UOB uni$ valid? After converting to miles  will it still valid for another 3 years? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Two years. After paying $25 for conversion n crediting into Kris account  another 3 years.,btohqsg

Btw  does anyone know how to change the preferred category for UOB lady card?,btohqsg
And is the grocery including anywhere such as shengsiong  cold storage?,btohqsg
I have no comment on this  but you need to factor in HSBC points expiry date is 36-37 months and it is 4mpd card that covers most of daily expenses.,btohqsg
They replied must wait at least 3 mths. If still don’t have then call back lol. Ask me wait 😅,btohqsg
Google “uob lady’s card reward category”,btohqsg
Click on the Blue “i” circle in the category from the website. Yes  SA and CS is included  so does donki mediya,btohqsg
It can be changed the first day of the quarter? Like October 1st?,btohqsg
You can get this info on UOB Lady TnC.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if this moomoo promo  will it be counted if withdraw existing funds and deposit back ?,btohqsg
Calendar month. The T&Cs states the what and how quite clearly,btohqsg
MooMoo replied me on this. Cannot.If u already have $ in funds when the promo is launched  that is considered as your net asset. If u withdraw $x and put back $x  your net asset value increase is $0.U need to pump in fresh $10k and do 5 fund. trades. Only the $ above your net asset earns 5.8%.Eg if u have $20k in fund when the promo was launched. If u withdraw $10k n deposit back $10k  your net asset still is $20k. U won’t get 5.8% tier 1 coupon.ButIf u leave the $20k and then deposit in $10k  your net asset increased 10k. Then the 20k will not qualify for the 5.8% and continue to earn the prevailing interest rate  but the $10k that u topped up will enjoy 5.8%.For me I am in this second category. So I will skip this promo. Sad.I think this promo is good for those who don’t have any funds in MooMoo in the 1st place.Knowing this  I think next time if I want to buy Fullerton cash fund  I would just buy it in WeBull. Their their withdrawal is T+1 unlike MooMoo/Tiger. They also hardly have any promo for funds. But moomoo is very aggressive in promos. So my strategy is next time moomoo got promo  I go in  participate  get out. I don’t want to make same mistake twice leaving $ in there and then these can’t count toward current promo.,btohqsg
Wow thanks so much for this. And yeah good idea to just withdraw from Moomoo and use webull in the future,btohqsg
Yes this card give up to 3.5 percent if u spend more then 2k for the month if u have bank acct with the.,btohqsg
mooMoo getting smarter.They know we redeem n resubscribeOr redeem > withdraw > redeposit > resubscribe. Think they want fresh funds.,btohqsg
HSBC AdvanceNo min spend. Has annual fee  but easy to waive as long as got monthly spend to keep card active.Spend <$2k  get 1.5% cash rebate Spend $2k or more  get 2.5% for entire spend.$70 max rebate per month. Works out to be $2800 spending.U can get 1% more if u activate Everyday Rewards + programme in your HSBC Everyday Global account. If u getting HSBC cards  pls get EGA1% Cash rebate on EGA given 1-2 working days after transaction posted. U can withdraw this cash.,btohqsg
Anyone using SCCC? Can check if you have problem contacting CS? Really frustrating so far,btohqsg

hey guyshave anyone purchase IPL shots in Japan IPL Express. which card is best to use?I haveDbs altitudeCiti rewards + amazeHSBC revolution,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. This means that even if a person has existing funds in cash plus  they will also qualify for this national day promo as well as they deposit $10k in fresh funds? And the $10k will get a guaranteed 5.8% for one month? Do you know how long much we keep the $10k in cash plus? Thanks,btohqsg
does anyone knows that if DBS WWMC can get bonus points for mcc 8398?Online transaction,btohqsg
Hi guys  what’s the best card to make online purchases for USD?,btohqsg
anyone knows if I used UOB EVOL to top up YouTrip does it counted as part of the 500 for UOB one account and does it consider online transaction as part of cash back ?,btohqsg
If u have existing funs  then those will just get the prevailing interest rate.If u top up $10k and do 5 trades into Fullerton cash fund for example  then the existing cash will just earn the usual 3.8-4%  while your topped up amount of $10k will get the guaranteed 5.8%.If u don’t have any other means to earn higher interest and u have excess cash above what u already have in Fullerton cash fund  then by all means go ahead.,btohqsg
Can buy 10k x 5 times all on the same day?,btohqsg
U can explore InstaRem combined with MasterCard  Trust bank card  YouTrip/ or other multi currency cards. Or any other card that give u more than 3.25% rebate since if u charge USD to an SGD domiciled card  u will be charged at least 3.25% dynamic conversion fee. So u just need to find any card that gives u more than 3.25% then at least u will break even or profit.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will explore the options. I dont have that much existing cash in moo moo cash plus currently.,btohqsg
Should be. Scroll up and read the other replies to ascertain from other people’s feedback as well.In doubt  pls call MooMoo to ask,btohqsg
For me  I won’t take part in this moomoo 5.8% promo since withdrawing n redepositing doesn’t count.I will withdraw and park in HSBC EGA since I’m getting 4.3% + 1%.Then pray floor pray sky that moomoo has another promo that I can then participate again.,btohqsg
Ok I see  I will sure that there will be opportunities 😊,btohqsg
moomoo is the most active vs tiger or webull. if i were u  and u like fullerton cash fund; may i suggest to park in webull instead. Their withdrawal is T+1 only and they dont have much promotions for funds. So as moomoo comes up with another promo again  can withdraw from webull and participate in moomoo.then once done  withdraw and park back in webull and wait for next moomoo promo.,btohqsg
When u withdraw  1 business day later u get ur money,btohqsg
Oh I see. That is a good idea too. Will check out webull. So far  mostly using srs funds to purchase fullerton cash fund from money owl  but not buying too much too.,btohqsg
