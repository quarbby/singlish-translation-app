I went to tint it is to protect  but for the fun of it I went for the darker ones  and now is like cannot see my headlights Liao,btohqsg
You might have gone too dark,btohqsg
To protect can just do transparent PPF also,btohqsg
Maybe go for a very light smoke next,btohqsg
You can get those tinted PPF film,btohqsg
Creates a good tint without affecting your headlight’s brightness,btohqsg
And they usually have a super light tint,btohqsg
Arnav knows someone who did it,btohqsg

It’s a doughnut okay? Not wheel. Not rim. Doughnuts!,btohqsg
