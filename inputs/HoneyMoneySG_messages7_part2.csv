depends on which promotion you sign up for lor.,btohqsg
For $500 spend  what is considered as eligible spend?,btohqsg
Applied this in April  and start using it 1 May.Top up revolut using OCBC debit to revolut 100SGD.Every time tap for MRT or public bus  however only got 2 transaction and each is just 0.10sgd.Is it because of long holiday since 1 May?,btohqsg
As of now  physical card will only arrive 13 May  so I havenâ€™t activate the card. I added that to Apple Pay. Am I doing it right?,btohqsg
It's ok to use virtual cards before getting the physical one. Should be all good,btohqsg
As for the cashback  you should be charged as usual (so $0.10 is weird to me)  and the next month you will be paid back,btohqsg
$0.10 seems to be merely card validation  not the real fare,btohqsg
Ok  I wanted to get the virtual card clear ya. We are talking about the physical card added to Apple Pay as virtual card. Not the Revolut own virtual card as screenshot below? Correct ya?,btohqsg
wait a second  if you haven't got the physical card  how could you add it to ApplePay?,btohqsg
In fact it can. Havenâ€™t leh~,btohqsg
i think itâ€™s cos you topped up with debit card. for the 20% cashback you need to do bank transfer top up of 100 bucks,btohqsg
not sure mate  i just remember the bank top up part from chrisâ€™ videos,btohqsg
In fact event my card and my partnerâ€™s card havenâ€™t arrive and activate  because I do refer invite my partner  I get my 60SGD referral rewards by just 3 x 10sgd transactions via Apple Pay at NTUC.,btohqsg
- $0.10 is a MasterCard consolidated posting thing when after few days or a certain dollar amount. VISA is consolidated per day- Digital card can be added to Apple/Google Pay before physical card even arrives.- Do make 3x $10 with your digital card for referrer to get rewards,btohqsg
And yes  do bank transfer before end of month to be eligible for 20% cashback,btohqsg
Ok thanks@ChrisHMSG  now understand is needed bank account direct add money into Revolut not via any bank card method.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  does it make a different if I top up beginning of the month? Thanks,btohqsg
Dont do too early on 1st day. Time difference may make it rollback to previous month,btohqsg
I just to ensure  I do bank transfer of 100 again just now to ensure not conflicting with my previous bank card top up.,btohqsg
Hi all  I tried to use the revolut to pay for a transaction in tokopedia Indonesia  but the tokopedia apps rejected. Not sure why. Is there any setting to enable overseas transaction in revolut?,btohqsg
May be a platform problem rather than card problem. E.g. Shopee MY also reject non-Malaysian credit cards,btohqsg
Lol. You definitely don't know! æ°‘é—´ç–¾è‹¦,btohqsg
Rich ppl don't know what normal people does for living,btohqsg

Wow. Almost 2 3 days one video at least,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  is it still worth while to do SA shielding if one doesnâ€™t hit FRS with OA & SA at age 55? Can one just set aside BRS at age 55 and still do SA shielding? Thanks,btohqsg
Top up with debit card can also ah? No need to be bank transfer?,btohqsg
How long does syfe kyc take? It seems likee several days still not done..,btohqsg
Hi hi everyoneâ€¦ if I get a new insteram Amaze card and a new Citi reward card and want to use overseas  do I need to activate overseas use for Amaze/Citi?,btohqsg
Assume I linke Citi rewards to Amaze,btohqsg
I tried in Malaysia not needed to do additional steps,btohqsg
Thanks! So I just link it in sg and use amaze card directly overseas like in sg right,btohqsg
Mine was all retail spend contactless + online grocery (fp/redmart ),btohqsg
As advice by others  and by reading the requirement again  it is needed to do by bank transfer.,btohqsg

Will plan a video on passive income,btohqsg
Got shielding will always be better than no shielding,btohqsg
