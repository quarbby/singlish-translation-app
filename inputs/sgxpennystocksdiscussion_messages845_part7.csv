🍏Pika World Breakfast Date - 6 October 2023🍜Hold your breath. Exhale. That's what traders have been doing this week  as the much-anticipated job data will be released at 8.30pm Singapore time.While Tuesday's JOLTs (Aug) data showed disappointment  given a tremendous uptick in job openings  the data lags the critical job data by a month. Thus  the August data is pale compared to what we will look ahead to the September reading when Nonfarm Payroll data is released today.We expect the unemployment rate to dip to 3.7% while average hourly earnings should hold steady on an annual growth of 4.3%.So stay tuned as we ride this turbulent wave together.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
