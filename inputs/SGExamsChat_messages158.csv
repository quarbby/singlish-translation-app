Will mr be smaller or larger if co2 was dissolved?,btohqsg
For those ppl in pure chem prac^,btohqsg
Well u dont need context to answer this qn,btohqsg
I put largerCO2 dissolve means volume of CO2 dropMoles of CO2 dropMr = mass/mol increase,btohqsg
Cuz all I got was copper,btohqsg
does anyone have pure geography prelim papers?,btohqsg
hii i have a question  asking for a friend  will u get 0 for ur geog essay if ur point given is kinda wrong? like for e.g  “ mountains are only formed at convergent plate boundaries “ and the statement is like “ yes etc.. “ and then explains more about convergent plate boundaries with mountains,btohqsg
they ask u how far u agree^,btohqsg
got that kind of lorms ah wtf,btohqsg
like they ask “ mountains are only formed at convergent plate boundaries  how far do u agree “,btohqsg
fold mountains  volcanoes and oceanic trench are formed,btohqsg
I think u still get marks,btohqsg

hi  on behalf of my friend  for the titration qn for sulfamic acid do we have to x10 for the conc of sulfamic acid?,btohqsg
why are all of yall “asking for a friend” JWJDJWJD,btohqsg
my friends said need to x10 but idk y,btohqsg
does anyone know y can explainpls?,btohqsg
i put the conc multiplied by 10 cos u need to find the conc of sulfamic acid in a 100cm3 solution,btohqsg
and they say it was diluted in 1dm3 of water,btohqsg
i don’t rly rmb the qns HAHA but it’s something like the conc is .2/dm3 then use .2 multiplied by 100/1000 to find the concentration of the acid in 100cm3,btohqsg
Yeah they say“Q was prepared by diluting 100cm3 of the cleansing agent solution to form a 1dm3 solution”,btohqsg
I fricking love the english phrasing of cambridge,btohqsg
They expect a C6 student like me to understand,btohqsg
White is recessiveThen statement is “White furred mice are born only to two white furred parents”Their answer is yes,btohqsg
White furred mice are not only born to 2 white furred parents,btohqsg
Can be born to 2 het parents,btohqsg
I don't take bio but surely i took more than 1 min to understand,btohqsg
But I ask my bio teacher she say like she also dk why their language like that,btohqsg
I didn't miss the graph question,btohqsg
Anyone here took N level combined Geo paper today ?,btohqsg
Ya what u guys tested ah?,btohqsg
My sch the teacher got frm 19.45 to 19.85....my reading is 19.90 :((,btohqsg
My student found the prac easy,btohqsg
I hear a range of values,btohqsg
if student A in school Y gets a value of 19.00  and the teachers' value are between 18.9 - 19.3  he will get full credit,btohqsg
if the student value is 18.8/18.7 instead  a mark will be deducted for every 0.1 difference,btohqsg
All effects to bell curve destruction,btohqsg
I’ll be scared if I were your coursemate,btohqsg
Still all effects to bell curve destruction,btohqsg
to add on  if the student's value is more than/equal to 0.3 or more difference from the range of values the teachers get  is usually 0 marks.,btohqsg
theres 7 billion ppl in this world,btohqsg
HELLO j curious did anyone sign up for red camp?,btohqsg

Cambridge love playing pattern on us,btohqsg
how was the n level math paper 2!!,btohqsg
Today’s Math Syl . A paper 2 changed mark,btohqsg
The examiner crossed Out Angles with Circle and Probability on section B,btohqsg
Total now changed to 57 marks,btohqsg
The wages still the same 50%,btohqsg
The reason why probability was removed is Because the examiner wants to make both question of Section B = 5 marks,btohqsg
And Statistic and Algebra RWC is the most wanted question,btohqsg
wait so if they cancel qns they dont replace them n the time is same?,btohqsg
for replacing qns it depends on the day of exam then u will knw but the time will still be the same,btohqsg
anyone here from ITE Higher Nitec?,btohqsg

Is it easier since the whole syllabus is taught in 3 years?,btohqsg
I am indeed from a certain junior college,btohqsg
Surprisngly the sch doesnt even offer the only subject that can make this meme possible,btohqsg
Wasn't to me but to many people I know it was better,btohqsg
Yeah I know but not too old that you guys don’t know haha,btohqsg
If i went to JC id probably flunked As ngl,btohqsg
my year last time in syllabus,btohqsg
Its not just the syllabus- its really about the opportunities as well.@IcedMiloand myself were v great beneficiaries,btohqsg
Better than being stuck in ns,btohqsg
i find the use of insects as a derogatory word charming...,btohqsg
So you guys learn less each year?,btohqsg
didn't know you were into that kind of stuff,btohqsg
alot of stuff shifted to fmath,btohqsg
Id take my spf life anytime,btohqsg
Actually  its just probably the last 1/2 chapters being taught in year 3Year 3 is really all about honing your skills for As,btohqsg
I'll be damned then i wanna be out of my course,btohqsg
ya lol y3 just whack papers until u eat shit sleep TYS,btohqsg
Im ashamed as an MI senior to see such nonsense behaviour smh,btohqsg
Anyway@imindomiejust interrupted me from watching grays anatomy I hope you are happy,btohqsg
I see.. so it’s quite relaxed,btohqsg
why watch grays anatomy if u can watch me,btohqsg
less of my hair will drop,btohqsg
No i think Grey's anatomy is nicer,btohqsg
Id rather watch a blank wall,btohqsg
ok yes it is if uk how to manage ur time,btohqsg
MI gave me enough brain cells to dominate the CMPB iq test I ended up in military intelligence with all the RJC and HCI kids,btohqsg

I dont think its based on cmpb iq test,btohqsg
Well it is  clarified with my superiors,btohqsg
that one is just to determine if u retarded or not tbh,btohqsg
das what they want u to think,btohqsg
On our G50s we were required to write our rps also and all those ultimate trash ppl got OOCed,btohqsg
Dang I watch her stuff too,btohqsg
Ok if no more questions on MI imma leave,btohqsg

How she studied before and during A level period,btohqsg
Not sure if this is a flex or what,btohqsg
I WILL RIP UR HEAD OFF,btohqsg
That sounds good when I'm in ns already sia,btohqsg
Imagine 5 yr programme with 2 yrs ns,btohqsg
Though i may not be surprised,btohqsg
i saw some ppl who retained in yr 3,btohqsg
Chop too much hair chop brain cells also,btohqsg
But like my teacher say o level question dont really come out twicr,btohqsg
Why the sudden curiosity after 3 yrs,btohqsg
My sch used to have gp books w ques from 1990s,btohqsg
still useful  because you'll be very familiar with the type of questions that will come out,btohqsg
unless u fucking suay and this year they give u some stupid curveball lol,btohqsg
Until they threw it away last yr,btohqsg
Expulsion from sch for retaining twice consecutively,btohqsg
basically sch lose hope in u,btohqsg
do yall actually think i wld retain,btohqsg
Very weird to ask we dont know u,btohqsg
i wouldnt be suprised based on your,btohqsg
@IcedMiloare my grades still shit now,btohqsg

I’m sure someone’s done that before,btohqsg
U write ur name get half mark,btohqsg
Or like completely given up in life,btohqsg
It is even hard to get f9 if u wrote something haha,btohqsg
Maybe like just take for fun etc,btohqsg
unless u slept through every single paper HAHA,btohqsg
But how can u not know a single thing? U will still know at least one thing 😂,btohqsg
to compensate for ur sleep debt,btohqsg
or if they dont allow u to take the exam,btohqsg
my friend wrote smth and got it wrong,btohqsg
he did 1 qn only tho,btohqsg
Still will gain at least some marks 😅,btohqsg
I dun understand. I submitted blank script before. And i still didnt get U grade,btohqsg
U grade i get last year,btohqsg
I only gotten U grades in sch prelim,btohqsg
But in national exam they moderate is it,btohqsg
Is that why impossible to get U,btohqsg
Unless u are last in the cohort ranking in singapore,btohqsg
Oh but that means i was lucky twice,btohqsg
tbh aft the phy and chem and chi,btohqsg
i alr have a feeling cambridge gonna destroy us,btohqsg
maybe bc there isnt clt but,btohqsg
I got f9 for econs though i knew a very limited amount of stuff,btohqsg
so dont underestimate the difficulty of getting f9,btohqsg
Why is it a “thou” instead of “bc”? 😄,btohqsg
Yes i believe it is possible,btohqsg
Omg u all taking econs at o level alr,btohqsg
And is it alr offered at o level in most schools?,btohqsg
My friend teaching at westwood sec,btohqsg
Which sch u? Not westwood right?,btohqsg
I heard their econs q xiong one,btohqsg
My friend graduated from ntu econs,btohqsg
It makes her in high demand,btohqsg
I always tot it is nice to study it,btohqsg
Like it will enhance our perspective n depth of tot,btohqsg
But which aspect u feel cannot?,btohqsg
Actually i also cannot. I took econ module at poly and dying 🤢,btohqsg
But ig it didnt work out for me since day 1,btohqsg
Damn i have intentions on going business dont scare me thanks,btohqsg
Idw science for sure i dont like bio,btohqsg
Ok the aspect that didnt work for me was the theories dry and interesting but i have not fully understood n agreed,btohqsg
Engineering also no i dont like physics,btohqsg
Its more like i cant understand fully,btohqsg
my backup plan is taking bio in poly,btohqsg
Such as the Possibility frontier graph itself,btohqsg
But im not taking the exam so doesnt rly matter,btohqsg
Which aspect of business u like?,btohqsg
bc i like the brain more,btohqsg
Where can that get me without bio,btohqsg
i like the brain topic so whynot,btohqsg
i think got med sci mah,btohqsg
Uhh idk but i wanna go tourism/hotel management,btohqsg
Food industryPetroleum industry oil gas industryShipping industry,btohqsg
Hospitality sort of but tourism has business,btohqsg
bio is easy for me to rmb bc i can understand,btohqsg
it can be stuck in my mind easily so yeah thats why,btohqsg
Oh hahaha. My course 😛 ok all the best. At most just scrap thru  poly lecturers r lenient n will always help u. Score in assignments. I got a B3 given my poor standard😛,btohqsg
Tourism business i took. Got accounting n econ module. U chk tourism management have anot,btohqsg
Idk i thgt tp tourism didnt need to learn econs,btohqsg
Cos it wasnt listed in modules,btohqsg
hospitality is hotel services i suppose?,btohqsg
Not hard. Memorizing can pass. Superficial level  1 module only. Got mcq to help u up and short answered questions r predictable. Mcq questions r simple textbook stuff,btohqsg
even aft i go poly / jc i will miss mrs mah,btohqsg
In what way? Hehe happy to hear that thou i know is not true,btohqsg
I'd go tp but i'll see many ppl from my school man,btohqsg
Yes haha and the buildings r quite colorful. Not dull,btohqsg
I'll go tp if np rejects me,btohqsg
No what i heard got some guy start a bbt business and hes from tp,btohqsg
Yes cos project will help u up. Then got class quiz. Then a mid term paper and a final paper. If u got follow tutorial u can pass the paper even without understanding the whole thing. But to study n revise for sth u dun understand sometimes can be meaningless but not an issue,btohqsg
HAVE 😂 but i cant rmb. I think is long ans question or case study leh. Not essay,btohqsg
Is it alrighht? U like or don like?,btohqsg
Shd be hve 😂😂😂😂 one of the common fnb nowadays- u go recce??,btohqsg
Sp tourism is also goodSp is good,btohqsg
Uhhh more of the latter but id go there if its a course im interested in yknow,btohqsg
Ngee an poly also goodTp is actually not ranked first,btohqsg
Apparently its merged with biz admin LOL,btohqsg
Ohh nonoOk let me recall chk n let u know again later,btohqsg
Not exactly o level system but sth similar,btohqsg
U like? I think case studies r the best!,btohqsg
Its easier than essay but i still got 7/30,btohqsg
Yes haha the course motivates u to go. Why don like thou? Dun wanna see ppl from own sch is it?,btohqsg
But it was the one topic i didnt touch at all and the hardest so cant rly say much,btohqsg
Theyre the only poly without a tourism course,btohqsg
For econs? EwwU try marketing course la? Marketing is fun and easy and applicable,btohqsg
Ya my friends did tell me that econs is theoretical but different from actual world,btohqsg
If not tourism then i'll go for hotel and leisure facilities management in np which apparently doesnt need econs,btohqsg
I see. Hmm. I lived wif misperception for so long😂,btohqsg
anyone taking n level amath this year?,btohqsg
Isnt it hard to get f9,btohqsg
HAHA amath makes ppl brain go malfunction,btohqsg

That paper was too difficult for n levels,btohqsg
yes will do!!!! i mean still need study lah hope this year is manageable,btohqsg
Or is it the definite integral don't have,btohqsg
under graph was the bane of my life,btohqsg
I think I’m getting ghosted by my literature teacher,btohqsg
Are there any other lit teachers you can seek help from,btohqsg
Isn’t it weird to go ask other Teachers?,btohqsg
They’re all there to help you,btohqsg
None of them have taught me before,btohqsg
Just be polite and ask for help,btohqsg
But my teacher will take it as a huge insult though,btohqsg
And idk if the other Teachers will be willing to help,btohqsg
That’s a good reason to insult them,btohqsg
Anyway  if that’s an issue  can ask her for permission to talk to other teachers,btohqsg
If I were you  I would rather dare to ask other teachers than keep suffering with stress for exams,btohqsg
every eng cher in sec sch is useless lol,btohqsg
Nono but mine is actually on a different level,btohqsg
nah im p sure most are,btohqsg
Yes  except two of my sec English teachersI'm taking O level English as private candidate. I thought my sec 5 English teacher would help me  but she said she doesn't want to help me since I'm no longer her studentWth😒,btohqsg
She has her new class to take care of too,btohqsg
Tell her u will pay her some tuition fee. Cos its true that u r giving her OT without pay,btohqsg
Are you in poly now? :o,btohqsg
if you don't mind me asking... what was your GPA?,btohqsg
just received my 3rd sem results and abit scared,btohqsg
What course did you enter? is it business,btohqsg
i see  i got a 3.1 cumulative so idk if that is good enough,btohqsg
did u get ur first choice,btohqsg
Hahaha Long story  I almost didn’t get into poly,btohqsg
When I applied for course ppl with gpa 2.0 entered,btohqsg
I heard most business course need at least 3.2-3.3,btohqsg
will they take CCA GPA into account when applying,btohqsg
I was from CW last time,btohqsg
U in higher Nitec yr 2 now?,btohqsg
Yes Y2 already so they gona take this sem one,btohqsg
I had a 2.477 for overall cGPA,btohqsg
i got 0.1 extra GPA for CCA so that makes me a 3.2,btohqsg
but i heard from lecturers sometimes they won't look at that extra points,btohqsg
Sometimes they smoke u  u also dl,btohqsg
hmm maybe.. thats why i trying to find the average gpa needed,btohqsg
I rmb got list online de,btohqsg
you reckon RP will accept? saw that they have a business in diploma course,btohqsg
Maybe google ITE To Poly average GPA,btohqsg
I rmb there is business application,btohqsg
But if u miss the gpa COP by abit,btohqsg
Can email and write in to the course manager,btohqsg
For case by case basics interview,btohqsg

A math what is the score like to get b3/b4,btohqsg
has anyone taken o level eng and got a grade that was higher than they expected??,btohqsg
honestly I think o level eng is more about foundations rather than how much you can study,btohqsg
