From what I know only ocbc can,btohqsg
DBS and UOB FD I don’t think can use CPF OA to buy,btohqsg

Personal preference i guess? I always go for amaze if I can  because of the 1% overseas spend cashback + I get all the credit card rewards,btohqsg
My application for Citi credit card got rejected.. how long is the cooldown period before I can try to apply again??,btohqsg

How to stack this with Credit cards ?(Believe most cc excludes Nets transactions),btohqsg
This one like Malaysia normal TnG card vs TnG NFC,btohqsg
Except that Singaporeans are not too reliant on NETS Flashpay payment unlike TnG for Malaysia tolls,btohqsg

Hi all  I have been using Amaze+Citi Cashback for dining  groceries and petrol but the additional cashback is not reflected in the Citi app even though I have hit $800 min spend.Are these spending still recognised if they are charged via the Amaze card?Or will the additional cashback only be reflected in the final monthly statement?,btohqsg
U can see it in the monthly estatement and it will be credited in the next cycle to ur account too,btohqsg
Does krispay still gives you 4mpd when using CRMC?,btohqsg

most likely travel related mcc  not eligible for 4mpd on ocbc TR,btohqsg
Is there any advice on what would be a good alternative for furtherbooking.compayments? (For context  it is charged in foreign currency). Open to any suggestions  whether cashback or miles,btohqsg
Just wondering what card is good for big purchase like wedding rings etc?,btohqsg

Using liquid pay for hawker shows it as NET  transaction in the history. Does it affect cashback for hsbc revo or uob evol ?,btohqsg
Hi.For Tbills competitive bids  will I get the yield that I bid (assuming lower than the cut off yield)  or will it follow the cut off yield?Can use cpfsa for competitive bid?,btohqsg
Unused balance in liquidpay account cannot cash out right? Thinking of using this liquidpay app but not sure if most hawker centres are using it or not? Wait I top up already the funds all stuck inside…,btohqsg
You don't have to topup to use it  just add your credit card and use liquid pay to scan the QR code.,btohqsg
I have the same concern also.. not sure if the transaction will continue to my maybank platinum visa minimum spend..,btohqsg
Even if charged directly to credit card  it shows a 'nets' transaction..,btohqsg
Not sure what you meant but Amaze with CRMC is giving me 4 miles still,btohqsg
Bought ikea vouchers at jem using credit card and can even get landlease points 🤣,btohqsg
Hi  how do I pay uob Absolute statement by DBS/POSB,btohqsg
Online seem to only allow Visa/Mastercard,btohqsg
Pay Bills -> Choose UOB Credit Cards as the organisation,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for those that sign up for credit card promos on moneysmart  do yall send in the claim form after your card has been approved or after you spent 500 dollars on the card ?First time applying cc on these promo platforms so not very sure how to proceed 😂,btohqsg
hi guys  does this icon means that GrabPay can be used to scan this code?,btohqsg
Cut off yield if you bidded below it.,btohqsg
Ohhh so cpfsa only allows noncompetitive bid?,btohqsg
Hi! Just checking with you guys. Does shopback pay  favepay  liquid pay  etc considered online transaction?,btohqsg
Sorry  wrong info. Can use CPF sa but not worth it since sa has compound interest,btohqsg
T-bill non-compititive bids only 7% allotted 🥲,btohqsg
It would be nice if Chris makes a video abt the NOV 2022 BTO Flats and all the eligible grant that are able to receive.,btohqsg
Ya mans! HDB grants are confusing so videos on HDB topics will be well received by viewers!@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
ehh? got instances where grabpay cannot be used for PayNow QR?,btohqsg
Some of the government payment QR can’t. Like CPF,btohqsg
See this  like what I predicted in the T-bills video. Now Cut-off yield already less than 4%.Also CIMB come out and fight with RHB now for SGD Fixed Deposit at 4.15% p.a.!,btohqsg
Whatever that goes up must come down,btohqsg
Must compare Apple to Apple la the bank 6 mths rates only 3 percent only,btohqsg
And t bills give u the “interest” upfront,btohqsg
Nothing can compare to t bills for 6 mths rates for now,btohqsg
I will return to BTO videos when resources are available. Right now the challenge is always on the unknown release date that is difficult for production to execute within one week.,btohqsg
it is not upfront. You invested $98 and then get interest $2  so end of the tenure you get $100.,btohqsg
To@ChrisHMSGcredit  he had mentioned it a his earlier videos,btohqsg

Food court transaction by liquid pay was registered as fast food restaurants category on my DBS wwmc (MCC 5814),btohqsg
does DBS wwmc the 4mpd applicable to in app payment?,btohqsg
yes so long online and mcc not excluded. Favepay explicitly excluded though,btohqsg
From my experience most of the in app payments I made so far were considered online for wwmc and I got the bonus points. Probably got a few rare exceptions. I just started using liquid pay so yet to confirm the online bonus points.,btohqsg
6010 is the MCC code for liquidpay,btohqsg
again... this is for topup? using linked card directly should be dining mcc,btohqsg
For the yuu card  spend on AXS or topup grab can get cashback?,btohqsg

U mean grab card can top up to paynow?,btohqsg
if link citi rewards to Amaze  no need activate overseas spend cos Amaze converts it to local spend,btohqsg
this $10 bonus can be used for online payments?,btohqsg
Yes. But I think is 10% cashback for the bonus to deducted,btohqsg
No need as amaze will convert it to local spend,btohqsg
Hi guys  does dbs WWMC exclude online travel website buys such as agoda or SingaporeAir?,btohqsg
dbs wwmc is especially useful for travel spend  whr travel is excluded by citi rewards,btohqsg
Is there a problem in linking youtrip with amaze,btohqsg
do we earn 4 miles per dollar and instapoints if we pay fees in USD to CFA institute using instarem + citi rewards mastercard?,btohqsg
Hi all  Does anyone have any ideas which card is the best to pay for the hospital bill (about 5k)?,btohqsg
UOB Absolute. Otherwise Amex-> GPMC. Both will get 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Thank you. How about Citi rewards for this case? Btw I don't have any other CC except Citi miles one.,btohqsg
limited to 1k only for 4mpd,btohqsg
Don't thinking u get double dip any moreOnly 1.5 to 1.7 for AmexGrab no more pointe,btohqsg
Jist amex direct to the hospital if they accept Amex,btohqsg
In order to hit the $500 minimum spend to get the spend bonus for ocbc 360  can I charge $500 to ocbc 365 with cardup?,btohqsg
for govt hospital usually is excluded code. I have tried using the hsbc advance but with a private hospital so far I have gotten my cash back but only 2%? If pair with the saving account has addition 1%,btohqsg
If it is public hospital that can pay via healthhub  it is mcc 8099 which is not excluded on most cards.

i think this post sums  it all,btohqsg
Anyone knows how does the save bonus for OCBC 360 account works? Do I need to purposely transfer $500 into the acc each month  or just the balance of the next month is $500 higher than previous month  be it from salary or etc?,btohqsg
so long average daily balance in current month min $500 higher than last month's,btohqsg
did anyone below 80k/year succeed in applying DBS WWMC,btohqsg
me applied several years ago when my salary still below 50k a year,btohqsg
So if in Oct  I have $5000 in my acc  then as long as in Nov  the balance is >$5500 (May it be salary credited or etc)  it will fulfill the save criteria?,btohqsg
hmm okay im in the same situation as u haha. Let me try,btohqsg
Can I stack the lazada vouchers for my purchase?,btohqsg
If u log in OCBC desktop version  u will be able to see the daily balance,btohqsg
When u click on the account summary,btohqsg
Any recommendation for a one card credit card strategy? Have a preference on cashback tho,btohqsg
is the UOB one card still worth it?,btohqsg
What's the best cashback card to use for ipaymy now? Maybank Platinum Visa?,btohqsg
yes if balance here refers to average daily balance (sum of end balance each day of month)/(number of days in month),btohqsg
Maybe HSBC Revolution 2.5% + 1% Cashbackhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lEIrge9gKg,btohqsg

If amex kana nerf from grab the it a kick to the coffins,btohqsg
Amex also no use Liao haha since it only 1.5 to 1.7,btohqsg
Does this also means cannot pay AXS with QR code already?,btohqsg
Www was laio even shopee pay also removed,btohqsg
Luckily still got liquidpay for some stuff.. But if overseas spend really is just AMAZE or Revolut (bank account transfer loh),btohqsg
Grab probably usable only for AXS purpose nia,btohqsg
I wonder if it is because of GXS that’s why they are slowly killing it,btohqsg
It’s a bank w SingTel? I assume they will roll out some sort of cardAnd I assume they are trying to kill it off so they don’t conflict of interest,btohqsg
No news up to nowSame as shoppee too the SEA Bank,btohqsg
Guewss all the down turn all the virtuous bank flopp,btohqsg
Drn the looks ni safe to bank with them their company Bank book looks bad all the layoffs,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you think uob FD of 3.85% make good sense? If yes  6 or 12 months?,btohqsg
Hi  is it good to pair amaze with maybank family and friends card?,btohqsg
It is still on uptrend. Of course short period will be better.,btohqsg
Thanks. Was thinking whether to all in now. Looking at T bill trend  interest rate should have peaked? 3.85% is the same for 6 vs 12 months  so wondering which tenure to go for.,btohqsg
why not OCBC360 or HSBC EGA highet interest >4% and more flexible ?,btohqsg
I have a citibank rewards visa (not mastercard). If i top up amaze card using it  does it convert to local spend or it will just be a normal top up without reward points. Thanks.,btohqsg
yes if your spending fall in the selected categories. Save of fx fees and convert to online,btohqsg
Tks. I will switch the card to mastercard.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan do a short update on cards after the recent nerfs?,btohqsg
How do I pay my Amex tcb instantly or the fastest way? Because if pay through axs will take 2-3 working days to process.,btohqsg
New member. Traveling to japan soon  have Amaze and Revolut. With all the nerfing  i just want to save/avoid the foreign conversion charges of local cards. should i use:CITI PREMIEREDBS WOMENS WorldDbs altitudePosb dailyThese are the only MC i have the rest are visa/amexOr is it better to top up via prepaid revolut/amaze/wise,btohqsg
Personally will vote Amaze if u wanna clock miles with ur Citi PM  got 1%cashback in points too but idk if you will be able to hit enough to redeem the $20 in time cause based on fx spend only.,btohqsg

Promotion is already over. You can contact Nestia support but they will charge a $10 fee,btohqsg

It just got nerfed this morning :( Grab MC can’t top up any e wallets like Revolut and Youtrip anymore,btohqsg
i'm brainstorming. Welcome to ideas after grab nerf,btohqsg
Just when I purchased Revolut metal to get the 2.7% cash back grab nerfs the top up 😭,btohqsg
That often apply only to local cards to local rentals. It’s not that common for international car rentals. Also  3rd party insurance often require the damage to be charged first and will only get waived/reduced after the insurance companies sort out their end of investigations,btohqsg
Hmmm. Any other suggestions to buy overseas rental insurance? I booked directly with Enterprise (got company discount). But for insurance buying on site would be super expensive…so thinking of alternatives.,btohqsg
Official: Grab has nerfed top-ups to other prepaid wallets and PayNow QR this morning. So all these Youtrip  Revolut  Bigpay cannot be topped up by Grabpay Card nowFor discussion: Visithttps://t.me/honeymoneysg,btohqsg
What's the nerf? Cannot top up to youtrip/revolut etc anymore via grab?,btohqsg
Having experienced rental car nearing total damage twice (not at fault) i dont skimp on that anymore  personally.,btohqsg
The combination of unfamiliarity with the car  road rules  traffic  and other situations  knowing no damage claims beyond certain excess gives a huge peace of mind,btohqsg
Just curious  Amex don’t allow FAST transfer?,btohqsg
Really bad news.... Used to buy things overseas through revolut.,btohqsg

"hi guys  im trying to top up to youtrip  using gpmc but it keeps giving me the error ""you may not be able to transact""  anyone facing this issue?",btohqsg
shag... amaze topup with citi cashback+ still got earn anything?,btohqsg
if not seems like theres no other way to earn cashback to exchange foreign currency already right,btohqsg
u dun earn by topping up. Can link citi cashback+ to Amaze and set it as default card. Use Amaze card for foreign spending without foreign exchange fee. Get 1.6% cashback and instapoints for eligible spending.,btohqsg
i tried applying for cashback+ a couple months ago but got rejected sadly. guess ill just link my debit master card to instarem for now,btohqsg
Noob question but can we withdraw from overseas ATM using Amaze?,btohqsg
yeah what’s the nerf ah? I’m travelling this monday after just linking my amaze with citi  revolut + youtrip with UOB tcb > GPMC lol… not relevant means nerfed or blocked prepaid topups from GPMC? Or now can only do direct top up from credit card?,btohqsg
cannot use GPMC topup other prepaid accounts like youtrip/revolut,btohqsg
sad.. so now can only direct top up youtrip/revolut from our credit card without earning any cashback?,btohqsg
It will be last straw if grab to axs for tax insurance payments are axed.,btohqsg
Any cards can be use to pay axa insurance? Thanks!,btohqsg
What is the benefit of topup?,btohqsg
The last is if nerf amex top up get Cashback from grab top up,btohqsg
so cant top up grab with amex and cant top up to bigpay anymore ? die loh,btohqsg
Now still can top up grab with amex can get CashbackWho knows time will tell,btohqsg
Any cards can be use to pay axa insurance? Thanks!,btohqsg
With the grab nerf from ytd  do we still get cashback from using uob absolute to top up grab?,btohqsg
So with grab nerfing top up to youtrip what are the alternative anyone know?,btohqsg
But amaze still can’t do overseas atm withdrawals yet right?,btohqsg
Ah ok thx. Coz amaze charges it directly to grab cc as a transaction so it's not affected?,btohqsg
Will fairprice physical voucher qualify for singsaver qualifying spend for cimb?,btohqsg
Or any recommended spend to qualify?,btohqsg
Is this an intermediate step - grab > amaze > YouTrip? Or do we use amaze directly!,btohqsg
You can't link GPMC to amaze.,btohqsg
Okie means amaze > grab since grab allows e-wallet top up,btohqsg
This is possible  but what is the benefit of topping up grab with amaze? You want to cash out your amaze account?,btohqsg
You missed out TDA. Also for syfe  sg market have min order of 100,btohqsg
Is it still possible to top up Grab with Singlife?,btohqsg
U can. Try nit much users use sing life,btohqsg
The vouchers bought finest can be used at all kinds of ntuc? (Eg xtra),btohqsg
Yes. It’s the generic NTUC vouchers,btohqsg
Since grab dropping support for topping up to Revolut  what other ways can we cash out grab balance topped up with amex?,btohqsg
No more way liao. Need to find out another way I guess,btohqsg
Axs payments or slowly spend on grab rides or grab food 😅,btohqsg
hi guys any advice on insurance savings plan? am i better off investing by myself?,btohqsg
Doubt that is a good plan,btohqsg
Imo  high interest bank account/ssb/t-bond/low risk investment better than insurance savings plan,btohqsg
Izit because of high distribution costs?,btohqsg
AFAIK  you can't get back 100% of your capital should you choose to withdraw before 10+ years.That is pure capital  without any interest... Locked in for a long long period,btohqsg
Not a specific video  but you can check out the last part where I covered kris+ from 10:00 onwardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi4QxvUO62I,btohqsg
Insurance savings plan was 1 of the biggest financial mistake I made in my early years.,btohqsg
I am actually not sure if I spend more than enough on Kris+ app & able to get free flight tickets including the return flight?,btohqsg
ikr.. whole strategy got distorted and I’m travelling in 2 days time. I’m just gonna use one cc and link to amaze/revolut/youtrip.. screw grab lol,btohqsg
Still can use on other's purposes lor,btohqsg
It's when they Nerf  Amex  top up It's the final straw no more perk,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  for Syfe trade  I’m looking at DCA-ing into S&P and Nasdaq. Which are the best ETFs to buy for this? Thanks.,btohqsg
Can look at VOO and QQQM,btohqsg
Now that Grab has nerfed topping up Revolut  how can I use Amex to top up my Revolut and earn 1.7% cos Revolut doesn't allow Amex so using Grab card was my workaround.,btohqsg
Yea so means no more Cashback cos I think Citi Cashback card offers 0.3% for everything else but exclude such wallets like Revolut?,btohqsg
Most cc excluded too up to prepaid cardJust expect more nerf as time goes by,btohqsg
Not sure. I don't use youtrip,btohqsg
Promo till 27 Nov but it seems that disappear from app?,btohqsg
Will current month spend with Uob$ merchants appear here? Or only for previous month?,btohqsg
U try and update us hahaha,btohqsg
Hi the amaze card application referral codes is for what reward?',btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/unlimited-cashback-credit-card-terms-and-conditions/I think one more left. SC MC unlimited. I’m using YouTrip and Touch N Go eWallet often. Gonna give it a try later.Check Terms and Conditions. Cashback no exclusion for e-wallet Topup,btohqsg

Most already excluded so don't thinking twice to hack it,btohqsg
Suggestions to look at alternatives wah to tip up just nk more perks lor but still can use for now,btohqsg
Do we get 10x points if used in taxi? Amaze + CRMC? thanks,btohqsg
If its zig or grab/gojek  yes 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi everyone! Anyone tried using cardup to pay for renovation payments or high value bank transfers?If yes what cc card do you all use?,btohqsg
This depends on you. I use DBS alt,btohqsg

yes  better cost per mile compared to cardup if take on the 1.8mpd promo,btohqsg
Should I pay my utitlies with it too?,btohqsg
no  since can get rewards on cards without fees,btohqsg
What you mean by by that,btohqsg
Their free gift so sucky. Only limited to first 100 new customers 🥹,btohqsg
So if I’m not first 100 I don’t get anything?,btohqsg
pay utilities using some cards directly still get rebate/points without fees,btohqsg
TLDR for hawker payment for rewards?❌ Grabpay❌ Nestia✅ Liquidpay✅ AMEX TCB,btohqsg
Any Amex issued card that can do Amex QR,btohqsg
Hmm  which Amex has good rewards? I’m targeting 4MPD,btohqsg
Remember to check Amex app for offer for Amex user not uob Amex users don't applied,btohqsg
Haha  I’m gonna use liquid with citi rewards,btohqsg
What’s good for Amex  only have TCB now,btohqsg
Nv try. You’ll have to ask at the counter.,btohqsg
Still waiting for a holistic review for the platinum card from Amex. Tha $1.7k++ annual fees,btohqsg
Good afternoon guys  I’m looking at exploring UOB ONE.I would like to ask  pardon me(I’ve yet to read T&C)Does the 3 months spending tiers works on an average? Or is it based on the minimum?,btohqsg

Not maintaining that ever since i started my automatic portfolio herehttps://youtu.be/4qO-9_S_FAo,btohqsg
Okay thanks.Like that OCBC 365 seems to be better for my use case.,btohqsg
Ocbc 365 gota higher min spending per month if u can march it then ok,btohqsg
My usual spending is abt 800-1000 per month.So I would think 365 would suit my use case better in terms of interest add onBecause I also have OCBC 360 but I’ll need to really compare it,btohqsg
Ya ocbc bank rate now Damm goood,btohqsg
Ya that’s why I’m exploring to see how I can further exploit it.After all  I’m already crediting my pay to it.And also I wanna up my Cashback game 😂,btohqsg
Ya good u met their req,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll just try out their card for 1 year then I’ll see how it goes,btohqsg
Anyone here used to have Citi premiermiles visa and manage to get it exchanged for the Mastercard variant before card expiry date?,btohqsg
I had itI opted in for MC but they still send me VisaMy friend called up and asked to change  he had to close account and forfeit the miles before he can change to MC.,btohqsg
Just keep both Citi PM lah  4x airport lounge pass,btohqsg
Haha I’m not sure if it is possible to have 2 Premiermiles at the same time.Or it is possible?,btohqsg
I use revolut to draw out Cashback and withdraw cash in jb.So still useful,btohqsg
Just wanna be really careful  can I assume this “Other Spend” category for UOB ONE  is literally referring to other spends right? Not just overseas?,btohqsg
Yes  other eligible spend that don't fall under extra cashback.,btohqsg
Hi if I goings to buy phone at court/ challenger/ best denki will uob one card got 3% ?,btohqsg
U need to fulfill the quarterly spend requirement,btohqsg
Ya I will spend 500 or 1000 at least just want to confirm if buy from retail like courts will be under theirs McC,btohqsg
oh thats interesting  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
there's a clause for min. 5 transaction of UOB one to qualify for the tiers  does supplementary card spendings count into the 5 transaction?,btohqsg
Yes sup card transaction count as well,btohqsg
nice! and thanks  sent in application yesterday. see whats UOB response.,btohqsg
looks like if spend on best denki / callenger / courts is mine 3.33 unless i spend on those they stated extra 10 or 15% catagories Up to 6.67% additional cashback1 on groceries  health and beauty and convenience store spend at Dairy Farm International transactions (Cold Storage  CS Fresh  Giant  Guardian  7-Eleven  Marketplace  Jasons  Jasons Deli) when you qualify for your quarterly cashback.or this daiy farm got extra 15%,btohqsg

any suggestions like i get uob one spend 1000 but if spend another 500 which other card to apply to get max cachback since now cant double dip using grab - spending is mostly on paywave retails shopping lesser on online   - best to have no min spend or lower min spend,btohqsg
I don't think any debit card have any cashback. No recommendations at all.,btohqsg
Depends on what your spending pattern is like. How much do you spend a month? Are you student  NSF  or working? What category do you spend most on?,btohqsg
can try uob one debit but mostly debit card got gimped benefit,btohqsg
Your UOB Card/CashPlus application(s) is/are successful. For assistance  visit the UOB website or call 1800 2222121,btohqsg
SC Jumpstart is good too if you're between 18-26yo. 1% cashback on pretty much anything  and can pair with Amaze,btohqsg
Not sure if it means my card or my UOB One account.I received an email to say my UOB ONE Account is open @ 0908h1000h I received this text. But I log into my UOB Application  there’s no additional card.I don’t think I’ll get rejected for this card because I already have a UOB Amex with them though,btohqsg
congrats just wait and login to uob app u should see the card inside but cant use first,btohqsg
Okay I’ll see how it goes later  after my consideration for use case and my spending patterns I think UOB One is better for me and my wife  just the pet food every month already 300+ liao,btohqsg
Just need to track my spendings so I don’t fall between tiers,btohqsg
ya uob one got mine 500 min spend,btohqsg
Is there anyone facing issue logging in to Instarem app?,btohqsg
It’s the in between I worry haha cos No Cashback for those spending in betweens I think haha,btohqsg
ya that why im looking at if spend 500 and if cantspend 1000 maybe look at another option like maybank visa $350,btohqsg
Previously when using UOB One  if I find myself in between tiers  I will go buy FairPrice voucher to get to the next.,btohqsg
That sounds like a good back up plan,btohqsg
but you need to hit it for 3 months straight. by then you might be over stretching your finance. not sure whether is it a good thing to do,btohqsg
what you can do is to get UOB One as your main card. Once you hit $500 change to HSBC revolution  use their reward point and get 2.5%,btohqsg
base on common MCC  Best Denki is 5732 which is under department stores,btohqsg
I would say NTUC voucher works the best if you are someone who always can hit $500  and for that month you short of $100. Can just top up $100 on NTUC voucher.But if you want to buy NTUC voucher every month just to promote to another tier  might not make sense for you. You might give up after a while.,btohqsg
Based on my tracking  I should not have a problem hitting 1k every month.Likely I’ll stop @ 1k plus a bit to be safe  then I’ll move on the next card.,btohqsg
Yup what other card u looking at,btohqsg
Awesome  base on your spending I guess UOB One is a very safe choice for cash back if you dont have specific high spending like grocery  dining or petrol.,btohqsg
anyone know if i use HSBC revo to buy $500 taka voucher for the free gift does it work?,btohqsg
My current plan would likely be1. UOB One2. CRMC + Amaze3. Absolute amexI’m more of a Cashback person  and I don’t really want to dilute the current miles effort that my wife is doing now,btohqsg
Ya I guess hsbc Revo can consider tooLike retail spend like ntuc or challenger or best denki for big ticket like tv,btohqsg
Yeah  my spendings are quite random  so when I compared between Ocbc 365 and UOB one.The UOB 1 is more suitable for my use case.Just need to put in a bit more effort to be mindful of my spending limits,btohqsg
HSBC Revo has cap spending reward for first $1000  but base on his tracking he shouldnt hit it.,btohqsg
What are the benefits of pairing with amaze with the SC debit card? On top of the 1%,btohqsg
The 1% cashback on SC Jumpstart is for all transactions local and foreign. But for foreign transactions SC charges about 3% whereas amaze you just have to pay for the spread,btohqsg

Yup just using amaze as 1 card to toggle easily. Anyway  I think I saw an old OCBC HWZ post confirming that Lazada/ Shopee does count towards 10x. Thanks!,btohqsg
I need advice  is there any card that is perfect for collecting miles and also offer great petrol discounts?,btohqsg
Going for a trip and was wondering if the Citi PremierMiles card insurance cover my girlfriend,btohqsg

She does hold a Citi cashback + card and I’m wondering if I should then let her buy separate then we purchase seats next to each other then both get to sit with one another,btohqsg
Citi PM insurance honestly is quite basic  i dont usually rely on it and just get it from proper insurance agents tho,btohqsg

guys i wanna ask fr your views  i am flying off japan this coming week.now that gpmc nerfed youtrip.in my arsenal i havetrust debityoutripcrmc amazeUOB One (if it arrives in time)SC UnlimitedAbsolute AMEXwhich 1 should i use to get the best bang for buck,btohqsg

Hi all  for OCBC rewards users. Not sure if this was discussed. But the stack reward website have been down for quite some time already,btohqsg
"One question for Citibank card. I can only pay the bill when the ""Ready Credit Bills""is out right?  Can I pay in advance?",btohqsg
Hi all  now that gpmc nerfed youtrip/revolut  which cashback cc (visa/mc) is still usable for youtrip/revolut? Thanks.,btohqsg
I looking to buy a camera at the sony retail store. Is OCBC titanium the best card for such purchases?,btohqsg
Yes. U can pay ur bills even before ur statement is out. U can pay more than you have owed on ur statement.,btohqsg
May I know how do I do that?,btohqsg
Previously was paying when the statement was out only,btohqsg
U can use ur usual method of paying... No need to wait for statement to come out,btohqsg
Alright thanks. I just use the same way of paying the statement right,btohqsg
U can refer to the unbilled part in ur statement to see how much you've spent...,btohqsg
But it’s only good for the 1st $1k or just whack only?,btohqsg
Atm  CRMC + amaze gives most bang for buck due to 10x rewards on online spend  provided non excluded MCC...,btohqsg
visa is a no no as revolut adding 1.5% when use to top uponly MC can top up without feebut mostly topup credit card dont have any cascback points,btohqsg
Thanks. What abt MC to Amaze to Revolut? I do regular transfer to overseas for family members so using Revolut for this.,btohqsg
Stop using revolut since they stop the simplyGo promo for existing customers. Will just finish using the money inside when go JB,btohqsg
Will be using Amaze + citi cashback+ for all my overseas sending,btohqsg
1.Crmc with amaze2. Trust bankTrust debit also gives you 0 withdrawal fee. Don't need the rest.,btohqsg
Amaze works with most MC. Just that CRMC offer 4mpd with Amaze. I pair with UOBKF and UOB Prvi as well for travel related transactions such as hotel spend and local transportation,btohqsg
Direct MC will do  going through amaze dont give extra benefit. Think revoult mcc should be excluded,btohqsg
Okie. So tat means TopUp to amaze thru MC doesn’t give any cash rebates too?,btohqsg
All top up dont earn rebate,btohqsg
yea those top up to amaze by visa no points,btohqsg
only direct use via linked with mastercard,btohqsg
think only amazme can link to google pay not apple or samsug pay if want to skip carry the phycial card,btohqsg
look like this are the recommeded one,btohqsg
guess if hsbc revlution is a MC is can be a good choice too as no min spend,btohqsg
Does anyone know if top up to grab wallet using uob absolute still get cashback?,btohqsg
Does anyone know the process of hsbc revolution claiming cashback or miles? is it troublesome?,btohqsg
cashback is nearly instantly after submit it will reflect on next bill deduction,btohqsg
Can i know what is your credit card strategy? Im trying to find a strategy that is easy to keep track and doesnt involve alot of spending.,btohqsg
if you want high cachback usually comees with a caveat,btohqsg
min spend to meet or  catagory need to meet so need to see which cards fits u and you want to do homework,btohqsg
If my renovation contractor doesn't accredit card  what methods are there to utilize credit card to pay reno? I don't mind a fee  if its still worthwhile.,btohqsg
Can Citibank cashback+ use to top up Youtrip?,btohqsg
Or should I replace Youtrip with Amaze?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if anyone know that using WMW or Citi Reward on shopback food and hawker payment would earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone encountered issues with Kris+ app payment ? Recently I am unable to make payment after selecting the credit card. Press continue but nothing happens. Sometime can sometimes unable to. Weird,btohqsg
Don’t think you get Cashback by topping up to youtrip,btohqsg
CRMC can be used with liquid pay for 4mpd. Else can use FairPrice app to pay at selected KPT outlet,btohqsg
Does anyone know if UOB Evol get cashback from starhub and utlity bills?,btohqsg
Hmm.. what is the alternative if still want to continue using Youtrip instead of amaze?,btohqsg
I’m using both amaze and youtrip. Both linked to my citi cashback+ but only amaze can get cashback,btohqsg
Yes it is considered as online payment,btohqsg
I'll think youtrip is safer  since you can topup only what you need. And Youtrip allow you to convert first and store  that's what a lot of my friends is doing to Japan Yen.,btohqsg
Youtrip same as Revo u can lock down the rate if u go over seas,btohqsg
If u see rate good u buylow and keep it,btohqsg
But Revo has weekend 1% fee  small amount. but it feels like Revo has no purpose anymore,btohqsg
Don't top up on weekends lah,btohqsg
Pay now to top up Youtrip  no point using cc to top up Youtrip.I use :- Youtrip/ Revolut- Amaze + CCfor me  I find that amaze give better rewards,btohqsg
Usually u don't suddenly go overseas If fly far so u can ppan on weekdays buy low yen examples,btohqsg
I chalk up $300 SGD buy low yen and spend when I go jp,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys for the information,btohqsg
I tried amaze + cc for my trip to japan,btohqsg
In the end I got net about 1.7% cashbackThough forex markup was high and not worth it,btohqsg
Revolut spend with 1% cashback would have been better for me (since I have metal),btohqsg
BTW they have a promo going on,btohqsg
For metal fees... check them out..,btohqsg
but u use revo u top up no cashback usually,btohqsg
plus u need to top up for revo metal,btohqsg
worth the effort to pay for subscription?,btohqsg
What credit card can I use to top up revo. I don't need any cash back or miles. Just need 0 fees for cash advance purposes,btohqsg
for now visa still canin future only MC will get zero feees when toppping upoffcourse no cashback whatso ever when topping up revo,btohqsg
Agree... Amaza spread is too high  not able to justify the cashback,btohqsg
Topup for prepaid card usually have no cashback,btohqsg
Mastercard is good  bank topup is great [if you have DBS],btohqsg
Can I use citi cash back plus to top up?,btohqsg
as longas its a MC it ok no fees,btohqsg
visa topping up may have fee soon just a matter of time,btohqsg
Metal is good at current rates... plus I get high cash withdrawal for my trips,btohqsg
Had been using Amex-GrabPay to top up revolut.Is there any other eWallet that accepts Amex topups?,btohqsg
Wouldn't instarem give u back 1% too (in the form of points),btohqsg
eh? What's the nerf?I also hold metal now but was considering if to stick with instarem till the $20 mark for my upcoming trip before hopping over to revolut,btohqsg
Yes. I do know that.Thus have to move on from that direction.My question was  is there any eWallet that accepts Amex topups,btohqsg
Do note that if u treat revolut as cash advance too often it might trigger their system,btohqsg
Unless your cash advance refer to oversea atm withdrawal,btohqsg
ahha unless if not revolut will black mark him and u know its what next gonna happen,btohqsg
Overseas withdrawal is acceptable use of credit card funds,btohqsg
My bad  I believe you should complete the 20$ mark and switch over,btohqsg
Once banned banned forever by revolut. My friend kena,btohqsg
That's true. Don't milk the cow till it dies.Bring it out to pasture and feed some grass to it. Add some other transaction which adds value to Revolut.,btohqsg
use cc can build up credit score.. paynow topup no benefits at all haha,btohqsg
ah didn't know  thanks for sharing,btohqsg

Hello guys  would citi rewards pair with amaze get rewards from utilities and hdb season parking fees ?,btohqsg
just to check  does WWMC + amaze qualify 4MPD for online spending for hotel banquet payment?,btohqsg
From 1 June 2022  DBS will add all Amaze transactions to its rewards exclusion list  ending the possibility of earning 4 mpd with the DBS Woman's World Card (or any points with any DBS card  for that matter),btohqsg
Hi  I just came back from Japan and they do accept amaze card. Most importantly  the merchants need to have the payment terminal for Mastercard.Do note that their fx rate isn’t very good..for e.g.  I did a purchase of 12 900 yen. Convert to sgd is about $128.46..$1 SGD = 100.4 yenWhereas  YouTrip was about $1 SGD = 102.5 yenI mainly use Youtrip in Japan as I took advantage of the gpmc-> youtrip~,btohqsg
I can no longer top up youtrip using GPMC,btohqsg
Use Alternative as Grab Nerf alot already,btohqsg
Hihi what is this gpmc -> youtrip about??,btohqsg
Curious about Citi rewards+ amazeSo if we add Citi to amaze and we tap the physical card or via Google pay it's will earn points on both amazing and Citi and tap on all type of purchase or it's limited to certain McC ?,btohqsg
Outdated info already😂 grab nerf topup to e wallet now again become amaze is better,btohqsg
Wasn't reporting any news. Just saying I can't top up using GPMC anymore,btohqsg
Utility bill confirm cannot  it is rewritten in the t&c. Starhub internet/phn bill nt sure. Some say can as it is not considered as utility.,btohqsg
Starhub bill can  pay on their mobile app or online website to get the online spend category. Recurring payment does not count.,btohqsg
Starhub is telco mcc  not utility mcc,btohqsg
So only uob one can? I still don't have it.,btohqsg
Citi rewards+Amaze earn 10x points on citi rewards so long MCC not excluded. Amaze gives instapoint only for eligible overseas spend.,btohqsg
Hi  will my full time employer get to know I am doing part time job if that job contribute to my cpf account?,btohqsg
So I still need to check if cito reward McC is not excluded from their list if I want to enjoy the x10 Point,btohqsg
yes still need to check that the MCC is not excluded on citi rewards TnC,btohqsg
I'm no expert ... But in most cases ur FT boss won't know abt your PT work  unless someone whistleblow on u...,btohqsg
Think most won't go check on u lah unless u forgotten and leak out to your working buddy or someone knows u hahahah,btohqsg
No  but they can ask you for your cpf contribution history.  MoM discourages this but there’s no law enforcing it  hence you can also decline to give  but it’s generally accepted culture in SG to produce one when asked.This won’t fly in other countries though  I never gave any when I was overseas and they will never ask either.TLDR = no  they can’t check without your consent.,btohqsg
Was looking at Citi PayAll  can get rewards for Insurance Premiums  Taxes  Rent  Education and so much more.,btohqsg
Just watch your youtube. Dbs multiplier is no where near ocbc 360,btohqsg
For ocbc 360. Salary + cc spend. Already 2.5%,btohqsg
No they cannot see your CPF without your permission. In fact they also cannot stop you from doing part time unless your part time got conflict of interest with your full time job.,btohqsg
Yes  now got promo till until Jan 2023. Get 1.8mpd on various Citi credit card.,btohqsg
I thinking about changing from UOB One to OCBC 360 and changing UOB One cars to OCBC 365.. my monthly spending only 1k+..,btohqsg
GPMC for now can add directly in app to top up thecrypto.comvisa card,btohqsg
I just unstake my CDC card. Doesn’t perform very well and I need the money.,btohqsg
Anyone know how to withdraw money from crypto to Sg bank now?,btohqsg
Can’t find latest tutorials on it😅,btohqsg
Guys which card give better exchange rate. Youtrip or amaze,btohqsg
To me is revolut but u nedd go lock down the rates on weekdays best,btohqsg
Rates itself  revo tend to give better rates than Youtrip  and both will be better than amaze.Between revo and Youtrip  use Youtrip on weekends  revo on weekdays.But amaze does give points which can be converted to Cashback at 1%  so it may be worth it to get cc rewards + instapoints,btohqsg
I don't think can withdraw from Kucoin. Will have to find another exchange to convert it to SGD,btohqsg
CRMC and DBS WWMC  any key difference between this two?,btohqsg
WWMC had a cap of $2k spend  compared to CRMC $1kAmaze transactions won't earn any points on WWMC,btohqsg
WWMC can also be used for travel related expenses,btohqsg
both of their points expiry is 5 years?,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo can use for travel too right,btohqsg
Can consider frank card to use first to hit $313 of spending and the rest $487 on local online and mobile payment to clock 6.2%($50 cashback out of $800 spend),btohqsg
hello! just wondering if we can still use UOB absolute+ grabpay card to pay for insurance premium to get the 1.7%  cashback,btohqsg
Still ok untill grab or amex nerf the 1.7 top up,btohqsg
So can I link my standard chartered unlimited cash back with amaze to earn 1.5% cash back on this ?,btohqsg
Oh I think with this 1.5% cash back the rate is better on amaze already,btohqsg
Think Citi rewards x10 is around 2.2% right,btohqsg
I don't have the Citi rewards card...,btohqsg
I tried a couple of days ago,btohqsg
Cannot use grab top up utrip alrdy,btohqsg
So cannot earn anymore cash back on youtrip. That's why now amaze still can link stand chart unlimited or Citi+ for Cashback,btohqsg
Seen like Citi rewards don't accept Ntuc for x10 Point5411 McC am I right,btohqsg
Why not? Use online spend  amaze or in app,btohqsg
Though some say it's depends on McC even u add to amaze?',btohqsg
Yeah  but CRMC online only excludes travel,btohqsg
So I'f Citi rewards exclude McC from spending from ntuc,btohqsg
Tonight I will talk about Grab Nerf and the way going forward,btohqsg
personally i have OCBC and UOB One account.in my use case  UOB one is really not good at least when i compare vis-a-vis.what i usually do is.1. Credit my salary into OCBC2.

Justt to know trust ppls say if u need cso support from trustNo  where to be found as users feedback,btohqsg
haha yes this feedback i have seen multiple times. i spilt between a few accounts to prevent myself to fall into this situation.but in general this is what i do on a monthly basis.,btohqsg

Can we still use grab mastercard to pay for income tax?,btohqsg
Yes  still get cashback for top up Grabpay wallet,btohqsg
Revolut works as it's a mastercard world debit card. YouTrip on the other hand is a mastercard prepaid  so it won't work.,btohqsg
Citi rewards with amaze on ntuc and retail Shopping vs HSBC Revo which better,btohqsg
If Citi removed the amazed perk I bet Citi rewards is considered a nerf like I hear dbs Woman card,btohqsg
If Citi nerf amaze I'm switching to HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Then HSBC Revo is a better card after Citi nerf amaze,btohqsg
Look at DBs Woman card got nerf is a bad impeding doom,btohqsg
CRMC + amaze is such a good combo. 10X points with low FX spread. If it kenna nerf HSBC Revo would be next best choice but can't link to amaze,btohqsg
might get another MC card like ICBC Zodiac or SC Unlimited,btohqsg
The next best thing after dbsWoman N crmc kana nefed,btohqsg
for linking to amaze for overseas spend  unless maybe CIMB got better option?,btohqsg
I'm looking at no min spend cards,btohqsg
Ya no min spending usually damm low %%,btohqsg

Wah sad. Why must credit salary!! UOB is one of the few that doesn’t require salary credit. Now this changes everything 😞😞😞,btohqsg
M not sure but maybe the paynow salary crediting could be a workaround?,btohqsg
I think it's used to be the 7 or 8 business day of the month. Not sure if they changed it,btohqsg
Can share more ? I self employed,btohqsg
Think no . Need to have a giro salary credit MCC. I am also self employed,btohqsg
There is still EIR 3% p.a. for $100K if no salary credithttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
so now uob one is better than ocbc 360? (only just switched to ocbc 360 last month),btohqsg
Why evol rather than one card?,btohqsg
Wow. Without salary crediting. Still got 3%. Ocbc with salary crediting only 2%. If uob one is eir 5%. Then no need go think of ssb  t bills  fd oredi,btohqsg
do you all close the other saving accounts or just leave the min sum in it?,btohqsg

Best to call in to check  afaik mine doesn't have fall below fee deductions but I can't rmb the circumstance in under which the account was created. If you applied it the conventional way  then likely yes.,btohqsg

Yes  unless you fufill any of the following conditions:1. You are under 29 years old2. Your DBS Multiplier account is your first account with POSB/DBS,btohqsg
I remember seeing post that DBS will not charge the fall below fee as long as you are below 29 years old. Implemented during COVID. Moved to OCBC360 and just keep the DBS Multiplier alive for GIRO payment,btohqsg
See when will DBS revise the Multiplier interest rate,btohqsg
What do u all clock to hit 500 monthly on uob cc? Town council  electric  water bills counted?,btohqsg
