But he gotta renounce KR citizenship cuz I think got age cap one,btohqsg
He should consider this if he got not ties or love for Korea,btohqsg
No need but he need to go back korea either ways to serve,btohqsg
You PR here no need renounce Korea citizenship cos Pr is not citizen what,btohqsg
Ya sia i cannot go outside for 6weeks tf,btohqsg
But I don't understand the question yall are making tho,btohqsg
Ok yea but u have to serve 4 yrs or u might end up becoming a refugee,btohqsg
Either ways also he need to go back what,btohqsg
Best is if he get PR here after NS age then don’t serve stay here forever marry Singaporean no service to either country lmao,btohqsg
It's 2 years he needs to serve either ways,btohqsg
Optimal path set out alr if you don’t want to serve anywhere,btohqsg
Since pr is not citizenship  u basically become countryless,btohqsg
Yeah the Korean government will not even allow u to renounce if u don't already have a citizenship elsewhere,btohqsg
No I meant you saying certain nationality’s life is worth less is your personal opinion. Other than lets say hitler no one shares you belief its not world wide,btohqsg
Korean citizenship can be revoked if you don’t show up to serve Korean NS?,btohqsg
Like it's physically not possible cuz being stateless is a pain,btohqsg
U will go to jail lol,btohqsg
Is only u kenna jail if u go back,btohqsg
So just don’t go back Lor,btohqsg
Ppl shit on u in society for not going army one,btohqsg
It is worth less I don't understand what are trying to say or argue here?,btohqsg
That a worker in India earns more than in Singapore?,btohqsg
Here’s your game plan if you wanna Siam all lmaoApply PR in SG after 21  get alr  get married to Singaporean  buy a flat and live here forever. Forget Korea,btohqsg
For Singaporeans need to learn Korean to do this in reverse xd,btohqsg
What age then not kicked in,btohqsg
So in another life u wanna be born in Singapore or India,btohqsg
Cannot be so high  I think there’s a lot of Malaysian Pr men who also didn’t serve Ns they in their 20s also,btohqsg
rather be a rich indian than a poor sgprn,btohqsg
U have no idea bro so many,btohqsg
Yes it does from a humanitarian stand point u tell me with your moral highground but when the chips are down in the end everyone will choose the economical solution,btohqsg
They first work here under EP two years then become Pr,btohqsg
Most of them become Pr within 2 years,btohqsg
Mostly IT roles cause short of supply,btohqsg
A lot of Malaysian become pr through this route,btohqsg
Basically saying richer ppl life worth more,btohqsg
Because it literally is worth more from a quantitive perspective,btohqsg
