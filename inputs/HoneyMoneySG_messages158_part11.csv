Hi guys how to pay income tax with Citi pay all ya? Have anyone tried yet.? Currently still on giro,btohqsg
Wait for the promo to be out.Many tried before. Haha,btohqsg
Ah okay so mean whileJust continue giro first ?,btohqsg
Oh your giro already started?The current rates not that attractive,btohqsg
Previously I amOn giro so it‚Äôs like auto giro from April onwards too,btohqsg
I can half way stop giro and use Citibank ? Am stillNew to this,btohqsg
My understanding is if you pay earlier than the giro deduction date  they won‚Äôt deduct your giroI think is 5 days before the deduction date? But others can chime in.,btohqsg
Better do it 7 days before the deduction  which is 6th every month. Usually setup payment the month before. Keep giro as backup.,btohqsg
pay at least 1 week before giro deduction,btohqsg
hi all . citi smrt can pair with card up?,btohqsg
Guys  I have a question. Would u pay off your HDB loan way before it's due if u can afford to? I guess the reason to do this is because this removes the need to pay interest incurred. The downside to this is cash flow or cash on hand will be affected. I would like to hear the views from members here.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure u can get higher returns than 2.6% with your cash on hand right.Now put into bank savings accounts still more than 2.6%,btohqsg
Glad you had confirmation from them.just curious have you submitted request on 10th or 11th?,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. Their plans only have 4G network?,btohqsg
Hello! Could I ask if the HSBC EGA 1% cashback program also applies to GIRO payments for income tax?,btohqsg
He literally said 5G in his original message,btohqsg
Unless is because you have too much cash on hand. And you are a super poor investor and also super cannot control spending. Then maybe it good. Otherwise. Make totally no sense to repay hdb loan.This is not financial advice,btohqsg
Is paying Tax on Cardup for next month onwards still 1.8%? I see their website is till 26 Mar 2025 onlyIn that case isnt ipaymy cheaper?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  a noob question please. For uob lady's miles calculation  is it based on posted or transaction date within the calendar month please?,btohqsg
