I know it is few months before key collectionAnge understood my question  anyway,btohqsg
Hello  is there any way to download remaining BTO units for selection onto a spreadsheet of sorts?,btohqsg
Used to have a way  but now no more  so everything you see is manually done,btohqsg
ok and is there a way to check last served queue number?,btohqsg
If you haveofficially received your appointment date  you can view the last queue number of the day from 12:00 AM onwards everyday  throughthis link. Help provide information by sending this toyour project's group chat  PM'ing me@smchua  or filling up thisGoogle Form. You will help the community determine the number of appointments for the day  and the dropout rate for your flat type.Updated as at 10 May 2023,btohqsg
