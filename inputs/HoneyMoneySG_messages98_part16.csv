U need to apply another bank cc to balance transfer over  sometime bank run promo like 0 percent balance transfer for like 6 month. Althernative  get a personal loan at lower interest rate to pay off cc interestNot wise to pay cc interest as it range from 24-25 percent p.a while personal loan is less then 10,btohqsg

Is there any credit card we can use to pay for our NUS school fees?,btohqsg
"Basically you pay off your cc via another bank at a lower fee/rates compared to your CC interest rates. Google ""balance transfer promo""  there's a lot of options available  pick the one that has the lowest fee for your situation.",btohqsg
"at clause (ii)  they could have simply say ""GIRO bill payments to any Credit Card"" to avoid ambiguity  instead of just HSBC Credit card if they want to exclude credit card payment.Anyway nothing much we can do  just wait to find out",btohqsg
That's why they cannot change their interest rates yet. The earliest their nerf start will be Jun.,btohqsg
i can consider opening in may  since UOB one until may then will drop to 3%,btohqsg
You can always start with 95k for 10 months to max of 100k,btohqsg
