Hi guys  I have the UOB One  KrisFlyer  and UOB Lady's Cards. Both the KrisFlyer and Lady's Cards are linked with Amaze. Amaze only gives points up to a certain limit. What happens if I exceed that limit? After that  which card is more reliable? Thank you!,btohqsg

Ibkr auto convert always convert less  my usd cash holding is minus  anyone have the same issue?,btohqsg
This is quite easy  citi rewards  covers most of it.,btohqsg

What you mean by no more amaze?,btohqsg
If you use UOB with Amaze  no more rewards. Starting 1st Oct.,btohqsg
Is this for the savings account?,btohqsg
What did u do to trigger auto convert,btohqsg
I am not sure what feature u turned on.If I buy lse stock whether in usd or gbp  after the purchase the gbp will be fully in negative amount.Eg purchase cost gbp4 500. I will see negative gbp4 505 due to commission.Then it is for me to either pay the margin loan. Or to manually convert my surplus cash from another currency into gbp.So obviously I would then convert enough to make it positive gbp1.,btohqsg
But this is not I manually convert  I just deposit sgd to buy usd stock,btohqsg
Anyway IBKR on a regular basis will flatten your currencies that are in small amounts (eg under $1) to 0 by auto convert to your base currency (however yours is usd).So even if u had negative gbp0.27 it will become 0. Of course u will have to pay the interest charged on negative balances until then,btohqsg
Do u have margin facilities activated?,btohqsg
Maybe I should call them tomorrow,btohqsg

Hi  does paying for cruise qualifies for DBS altitude 5mpd online travel spend?,btohqsg
Can we start again.How much of each currency did you have at the startWhat did you buy and how much?,btohqsg
I set recurring purchase of Cspx of usd2000  and I transfer in 2650 sgd. the fee is usd 1.86  but instead of converting usd 2000+1.86  they only convert for 2001.81  so this cause my usd -0.05,btohqsg
At start I have a few hundred sgd left from previous purchase,btohqsg
then u have to check your recurring purchase settings. Is auto convert checked?for my IBKR purchaes  there is NEVER any auto conversion of cash into the purchased security's currenccy.Why didn't you convert the SGD into USD before the recurring purchase date?Anyway i believe if you do nothing  they will auto convert SGD1-2 into USD to flatten the negative USD balances within 1 month  but you pay the USD loan interest on the cents until then.,btohqsg
points expiry should be 5 years+3 months. where u see 3 years?,btohqsg
Manual convert will pay sgd 2.94  but auto convert  no fee,btohqsg
The expiry date written behind the card,btohqsg
I meant the card expiry  not sure if thank you points expiry is affected,btohqsg
is it a new card account?,btohqsg
haha... then no choice loh.. u kenna the cents interest (not sure if will be waived)..,btohqsg
by right points expiry should be 5 years 3 months. Think can confirm with CSO,btohqsg
