hi does anybody know if JC admission cares whether u were dismissed from poly the year before?,btohqsg
I was told its called a centralised institute,btohqsg
But my sources might be wrong,btohqsg
What I mean is institutions that lead to A levels are apparently called pre university,btohqsg
Might wanna get it checked by a doctor,btohqsg
my heart go bedok bedok for u too,btohqsg
i forgot neil is married now,btohqsg
This is when someone hung up the phone,btohqsg
Mi can go up to 7 yrs,btohqsg
If only they gave me 7 years,btohqsg
U just never ask for it,btohqsg
Didnt know it was a thing,btohqsg
Want to go back army also cannot,btohqsg
I'm still but a peasant nsf,btohqsg
mom come get me im scared,btohqsg
Curious  during reservist  do they keep your IC and give you an 11B?,btohqsg
Oh  so they give you an 11B and you also keep your IC?,btohqsg
Oh  so after ORD they don't take the 11B back?,btohqsg
I'd be more than happy to return them,btohqsg
Haha.üëçI think they use the photograph taken during the Depot Road medical checkup on the 11B. Force you to wear an army shirt for it...,btohqsg

hey  is anyone able to help me with linear algebra? or does it fit under As group?,btohqsg
If you don't know what's in the syllabus,btohqsg
Ok whatever but I didn't delete the messages,btohqsg
What is 'relevant to academic questions',btohqsg
There were messages asking about due dates,btohqsg
While LA is under A Levels  if u need help for anything after that  I‚Äôd recommend stackexchange instead,btohqsg
TBH I feel like such questions would be treated by SE with extreme contempt,btohqsg
I recommend discord Math question channels more,btohqsg
There's also a discord Math Specific LinAlg channel - which has questions of all levels,btohqsg
you have the invite link? im interested,btohqsg
To be fair you could easily have been referring to another discord,btohqsg
This community's discord has the same-ish people anyway.There aren't many cases where a question on different social media platforms will net answer gold on one platform and answer bronze on another,btohqsg
BREAKING:US President Donald Trump says he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for COVID-19.https://cna.asia/3l6kzJ7,btohqsg

Why are you still eating popcorns,btohqsg
I see.. we are living in subatomic particles,btohqsg
Yup dumbbells for my brain daily,btohqsg
Ik 1 to 6 units is weird,btohqsg
But my teacher said that 1 to 2  1 to 1 or 1 to 5,btohqsg
My teacher also said that 1 unit must be like 10 small boxes of the graph,btohqsg
Does your teacher ever tell you about that?,btohqsg
Avoid anything that doesn't work well with 10s,btohqsg
Can this grp send memes?? Would love a few deepfried/ among us memes,btohqsg
If I finish a peanut butter jar and I wanna recycle it  must I wash it to be spotlessly and squeaky clean?,btohqsg
Wah I forgot about scale I busy memorising sources of error haha,btohqsg
Basically there is this simple guideline that I go by  if you take quite a bit of time or need to use a calculator to count/measure the value  then it is a bad scale,btohqsg
Like for eg right you want to know the value of the sixth square between 0 and 0.25 but then it's hard to determine instantly so it's a bad scale,btohqsg
Whereas sixth square between 0 and 0.1 is just 0.06,btohqsg
If you get what I mean haha,btohqsg
one sq would be 0.25 lo,btohqsg
unless you mean 1.5 units is in 10 sq then 1 sq is 0.15 which isnt v good,btohqsg

Dun kpkb  my rec pay was 560,btohqsg

dont beat me up ahboi senpai,btohqsg
But i was able to save up even taking 560 a year,btohqsg
I was studying part time as well bro.,btohqsg
"""we consider distance when sending u guys to ur vocations""",btohqsg

Quick qnsCut off 83.75 which student get in?Student A:Top sch w 85 rpWith ccaPortfolio okokStudent B:Worst sch w  88.75 rpNo ccaPortfolio full of cert,btohqsg
Okay  I searched it up  it is rank points...,btohqsg
Im fact the one with 88.75rp may even be offered a scholarship interview,btohqsg
Cuz right I know of two ppl who got those,btohqsg
And student A got in but student B got rejected,btohqsg
So I was wondering is it biased for sch,btohqsg
once you meet the COP they do not care already,btohqsg
But they give priority to citizens,btohqsg
cca involvement also speaks a lot of a person to unis,btohqsg
no cca doesn't speak too well,btohqsg
unless ur in an external org,btohqsg
if not you will lose out,btohqsg
no point showing you are strong academically because you have the requirements there already,btohqsg
I don't remember NTU/NUS asking me for CCA details... Particularly with NTU  they seem more concerned about grades and if you need to defer,btohqsg
if your course has a lot of people trying to apply into it,btohqsg
NUS had the personal statement to fill in,btohqsg
then they would want those that are most involved with the CCA,btohqsg
this way they can confirm that your uni will benefit from involvement of students,btohqsg
It seems that it is all about the ranking of the university...,btohqsg
anyone here have excessive tiredness even though u sleep alot?,btohqsg
Or depends on what time u sleep,btohqsg
Is normal to be sleepy if u sleep from 1pm onwards,btohqsg
no leh  i have been tired ever since i came to JC,btohqsg
and even during CB where i sleep everyday,btohqsg
That is why u sleep at 10pm without feel everyday,btohqsg
today i slept from 12am to 12pm,btohqsg
I get that at times when i sleep late,btohqsg
I will feel tired aft doin a bit of things in the day,btohqsg
So thats why always sleep by 12am or earlier,btohqsg
but im tired every single day sia,btohqsg
and u know my entire day,btohqsg
i only did 4 math question?,btohqsg
Could it be stress or other factors?,btohqsg
Why does it sound like me?,btohqsg
i dont even know what im doing,btohqsg
I have a math exam tmrw,btohqsg
i need wake at 6 for sch :(,btohqsg
i just wasted both my weekend sleeping sia,btohqsg
ytd i slept from like 3-5pm also,btohqsg
You should start training for NS next year,btohqsg
you don't want to sleep at the timing for A exams,btohqsg
i so fat how to run,btohqsg
Lol a lvls is either can sleep or cant sleep,btohqsg
I can't even do one push up or sit up. Instant fail in the PE exam in JC,btohqsg
but the issue is i used to think is cos i need wake up early daily to go sch,btohqsg
but during CB where i get to sleep daily,btohqsg
Prob is try to sleep earlier,btohqsg
Hmmm you should say you have higher potential energy to not be so obvious,btohqsg
I lowkey think you burn out,btohqsg
no eh  how to explain tired since J1,btohqsg
I also got some weird headache,btohqsg
burn out is a long process,btohqsg

Last time it happened was jc2,btohqsg
at first you will feel hyped,btohqsg
idts tho  i think im quite slack one,btohqsg
then you will drop and become very tired all of a sudden,btohqsg
Yeah  I also have migrane headaches  that's what the doctor said... Perhaps medication is the solution,btohqsg
Ever since j2 no more alr,btohqsg
so i shld start sleeping early from today onwards issit?,btohqsg
Impossible today can sleep way earlier one,btohqsg
Yes  panadol doesn't help me either. You may need a different type of painkiller,btohqsg
what should i do if i dont feel the impact of exam?,btohqsg
sleep early is useless if you knock down at the end,btohqsg
like i dont really see it coming even tho its coming in a week,btohqsg
What shld i do if aft the paper i find the paper ez game,btohqsg
and a level is coming in 9 days for pract  27 days for paper,btohqsg

Scolding for spelling the teachers name wrongly hahaha,btohqsg
U know is all over when u are sitting beside 2 rows of RI students,btohqsg
i spelt a ntu lecturer name wrongly then he blasted me on email,btohqsg
i wrote an apology letter in a very formal tone,btohqsg
and worst thing is I wrote another letter with the same name but he ignored the correct one even though it's the first one,btohqsg
Dear Ms ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I would like to sincerely apologise to you for my actions.  I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience caused due to my late submission. It is entirely my fault and I didn't mean to spell your name incorrectly.I will take necessary steps to ensure that this will never happen again. Thank you so much for sending in my application.  I am truly grateful and I really appreciate your time going through the data.Regards Mw,btohqsg
i had to go online to search how to type apology letter,btohqsg
wait i show you my one,btohqsg
but i manage to get the bursary tho hahaha,btohqsg
even tho i was late for 2 week,btohqsg
Sorry for the error made  I was sending two emails concurrently to you  Dr Kym Campbell and a representative of a demining organization. And I have sent the wrong email to you and was unable to undo the email when I had realised what had happened. So I sent a new email while deleting the old one thinking it would be able to remove the incorrect email such that only you would be able to see the correct one. I am once again really sorry for the error on my side and I hope that you would be able to forgive me and carry out the email interview.Have a great day ahead!,btohqsg
grammarly put a 5/5 for the formal tone i was so happy,btohqsg
MwFirst  it is very annoying when you can't even SPELL my name rightyou were all reminded to use your official  gclassroom email address by the HOD ITyou better be grateful that i had gone through all the data of  MOE FAS cases - very painful and time-consumingand had submitted your name to meet the deadline few weeks ago!!!in life there are many situations when once you missed the deadline  opportunities are lost,btohqsg
People that scolds you for spelling their name incorrectly is completely unreasonable. A lot of people spell my real name incorrectly and I don't scold them for it. Even if I don't like the 'new' spelling,btohqsg
she caps and bold it sia,btohqsg
but it was totally my fault,btohqsg
last time i have this teacher called Mrs Quek,btohqsg
but i spell it as Qwek,btohqsg
omg what did she say to you when you did that,btohqsg
den afterwards i ask my friend they say is Brian,btohqsg
den i typo and spell it as Brain,btohqsg
den i realise i called him Brain,btohqsg
you should be glad it's only 50 and not 100,btohqsg
but the name auto correct sia,btohqsg
Just tell the person off. And then  I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. Yours sincerely  xxxxxxx,btohqsg
uh pw leader is so difficult,btohqsg
i need her to submit my applciation for bursary hahah,btohqsg
the teacher gave us nothing do,btohqsg
help what do i do now,btohqsg
Then forget about it... I rather have my dignity back,btohqsg
so i mixed up Phua and Puah,btohqsg
but its my fault for submiting 2 weeks late + spell wrongly haha,btohqsg
i mange to get total of $720 tho,btohqsg
Nothing to do? What do you mean? Is OP over?,btohqsg
as in how do i train them over the internet,btohqsg
u better get A for PW,btohqsg
Then practise your OP and prepare for I and R,btohqsg
I ask the guy that said he wanted to train to train us and he did nothing,btohqsg
my friend got B even tho he did all the work,btohqsg
I and R they never even teach me how to do yet,btohqsg
or whatever bs he wants to call himself and then slack,btohqsg
worst feelng is if the slacker got A and u did the work but got B haha,btohqsg
dats why you file all the reports when the times come for it,btohqsg
my senior hard carry the entire team for PW,btohqsg
he was th only one with A,btohqsg
the rest got B and C,btohqsg
Heard is tougher to score A unlike in the past,btohqsg
Am I a bad leader  idk what to do for my team because we did everything already,btohqsg
then they want me do stuff but cannot come up with it,btohqsg
believe it or not  i only got my PW topic like 1 month before submission,btohqsg
and i spend the entire one month doing WR,btohqsg
Idk what to do now they even want to meet up in class break to do the WR,btohqsg
like the comments all empty one,btohqsg
I used to do PW until 4.30 am in the morning. Essentially addicted. I love PW,btohqsg
they saying now that i should not plan the schedule because idk how organise meetings,btohqsg
tell them that if they are so good  they plan and u follow,btohqsg
Wan my first time knowing such a passion,btohqsg
I mean we only have 1 point to do tbf,btohqsg
yea  den criticise them if they plan badly,btohqsg
but there is nothing to even do so idk how they can put in things to do,btohqsg
No  I did most of the work. But I don't blame my group as I wanted things my way. I was happy to do it alone. Although they did a lot of the OP stuff and the survey,btohqsg
theres surely soething to do one,btohqsg
ask her vet and give comment,btohqsg
he gave like 20 plus comments,btohqsg
yea  but u clear doesnt mean its correct,btohqsg
u need ask him check again,btohqsg
he saying he will check and book consultation if got problems,btohqsg
so now i am just stuck and lost about what to do,btohqsg
I mean if they want plan then they plan because I'm lazy to do so anyways,btohqsg
the planner will feel the pain of waiting 30mins for latecomers,btohqsg
We used to want to get over it in year 1,btohqsg
I want to get over it,btohqsg
Get it done and study the other subjects,btohqsg
