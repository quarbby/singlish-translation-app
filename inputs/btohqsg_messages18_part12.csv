KS:Hi guys  a questionFor EHG.If i hv only worked for the past 6 months say 5k salaryDuring ehg assesment  is my average monthly income divided by 6 months or 12 monthsThanks,btohqsg
Yeah  so i d like to know if my 6months of working  say 5kTotal 30kIs that amount divided by 6 months or 12 months for assesmnt,btohqsg
Point being  condition says work  continuously for at least 12 monthsWith only 6 months of work  you might not be eligible for EHG,btohqsg
Should be 6 months. But as@purrevilpointed out you may not be eligible for EHG  though you can appeal to be assessed  subjected to HDB approval.,btohqsg
Yeah  i was short of saying that if applicants are eligible with only 6 months of work yet salary figure is divided by 12 months  it would be a loophole + opportunity for people to abuse the system,btohqsg
Which is why i think they said 1 partner ahs to work 12months,btohqsg
So for my case I have worked for 12monthsBut my partner has been for about 8 months.If we combine our incomes together and divide by 12  the figure would be lower than its true value (what we take hone monthly currently).,btohqsg
So yeah asking in that sense,btohqsg
Cause if it is indeed divided by 12 months then i d be pretty glad  as i may qualify for a higher grant amount,btohqsg
Actually i am not sure why you are even asking something like that... HDB is not a fool,btohqsg
No  doesn't work that way. Only average for the period worked,btohqsg
Yes  the HDB officer told me that before.   Even 11 months  they could only assist to help seeking for case to case approval but no promise can get it.,btohqsg
What happens if we didnt turn up for our second appt for hdb?,btohqsg
Why u don't turn up ?,btohqsg
If u missed u still can appeal to book another appointment,btohqsg
If u don't want the flat anymore and forgone your selection fee then don't turn up at all,btohqsg

Hihi may i know if there is a group for east bank @ canberra?,btohqsg
Hi guys! I would like to ask for the new HFE application right  if my partner and I are both still studying and not drawing income  does that mean that I cannot apply for HFE since I am not eligible for housing loan? I heard something about the deferrment of income assessment. How does it work?,btohqsg
HFE is about eligibility to buy  loan is just a part of it!,btohqsg
I will be graduating next year so do I have to work one full year before I can apply HFE?,btohqsg
so still just apply so that you are eligible to purchase a HDB,btohqsg
but I am stuck at the loan page,btohqsg
because right now I am not eligible for the HDB housing loan,btohqsg
Call HDB and ask better ba,btohqsg
hi which part are u stuck at as my partner and i apply thru deferred income so i can help,btohqsg
Hi anyone know the telegram chat for project tampines Green opal? Thanks!,btohqsg

Not necessarily. There are many criterias that determine that particular company be awarded the contract.,btohqsg
Usually lowest  unless they can justify the reason for choosing anything else.,btohqsg
