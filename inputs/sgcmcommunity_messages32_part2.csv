Aluminium alloy can be stronger than most steel... Audi also use aluminium,btohqsg
Best to have service history. Must be accident free.,btohqsg
The service history is important. It tells that your meter is not rigged too. And that gives an idea of the work and reliability of the car,btohqsg
Next is accident free. A good dealer would provide this inspection and checks,btohqsg
Because they don't have it there  usually c180 on display,btohqsg
But got people who will buy as they want the badge,btohqsg
Should be part of your tool kit if your are 1st owner of the car  otherwise got to visit dealer,btohqsg
Then I drive on for another 50 or so.,btohqsg
Then I filled up to the top and take readings.,btohqsg
Aftermarket lug nut  I lost the key,btohqsg
So I got fuel economyOf 13.17 km a liter.,btohqsg
Give about 10%from this reading... üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
I changed these aftermarket to original. Previous owner used these I don‚Äôt like this. Small sized.,btohqsg
Is there any way to remove it,btohqsg
Does workshop help you cut it,btohqsg
I thought you said you never pump 95 anymore ü´£ü´£,btohqsg
But that means I have to buy new lug nuts,btohqsg
Yeah just remove it. Find a adaptor that fits. I suspect size 16,btohqsg
I said I never pump 98 in singapore,btohqsg
There are some places you can fill up 95 around Iskandar region.,btohqsg
Looks like 95 in malaysia to me..,btohqsg
Sinkie sia. Don't break rules can?,btohqsg
Is PML not doing well? Or feeding off competition,btohqsg
I got original Mazda nuts from Carousell seller.,btohqsg
Need to remove current ones first,btohqsg
Yes. Then remove them if you already found original,btohqsg
If no adapter must cut off no choice,btohqsg
Sir the whole issue is that he cannot remove them apart from chopping them off,btohqsg
Oh what I meant is singapore I don‚Äôt use ron98 at all. But in Malaysia I had no choice in broad daylight to buy ron97. But sometimes I would buy ron95 in stations that ‚Äúpermit‚Äù,btohqsg
Will bodykit shop help me cut,btohqsg
Why huh? Sorry I didn‚Äôt follow whole story.,btohqsg
Bodykit and wheelshops should be able to with an angle grinder but if they're not careful can damage your wheels,btohqsg
If you're sure about the dimensions  suggest you go for this and try it out,btohqsg
I‚Äôll try to use this one first,btohqsg
Just sending out the usual sale messages like all other dealers,btohqsg
Got contact on good wheel shops?,btohqsg
LS tyre and top93 good places,btohqsg
but before that you were gone for 230+ messages ü´£,btohqsg
Sure..No mention of 98 at all in those text. Pump 95 is pump 95 in Msia. No need to hide your shame of a sinkie.,btohqsg
Later end up like that Sorento who escaped without paying,btohqsg
mitsuoka cars resale price very good. all those renew Coe ones still asking high,btohqsg
too rare. only seen twice on Sg roads,btohqsg
how do you determine if a second hand car is a good deal? is there any tips & tricks to negotiate with the dealer?,btohqsg
Must see what the market rate is for that model and then compare various units based on condition  time left  mileage  and your preference,btohqsg
Basis that you can rate the cars and rank them based on price,btohqsg
Negotiation is upto you and how you do it  if you do a PPI usually can ask them to do up the minor wear and tear included as part of the price,btohqsg
would it be better to pay by loan or pay whole sum? cause i heard that usually pay one shot the dealer will mark up or something...,btohqsg
Yes there's a slight mark-up as they do not earn the commission on securing loan,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt let them know how you‚Äôll pay. Of course dealers expect you to use loans because that‚Äôs where they make a lot of money. Commissions etc. negotiate to the final price and then say you use cash. If they resist then ask them why.,btohqsg
These days many just want to sell quickly and move on,btohqsg
