bruhh dk anyt js admit lah,btohqsg
lol not like you know either?,btohqsg
bro istg when i hear abt,btohqsg
scare the living shit out of me,btohqsg
udk also then want talk what sia,btohqsg
Correlation =/= causation  even if it is true for some students not necessarily that being proficient at multiple languages is a zero sum game between the proficiency of each language. Tbh moe doesnâ€™t release data on the average English scores for hcl vs non hcl takers so most of what we have is just anecdotal evidence.,btohqsg
cuz i got friends who got cousins thr,btohqsg
also one can actl argue that those who take hcl could be better in english cause ur grades have to hit a certain boundary to take hmt no,btohqsg
Idk ah lol. Maybe moe should release more data too,btohqsg
I wish they continued giving more exact details of the performance of each Jc and so on,btohqsg
Up till 2003 they used to reveal the number of students with 4 As in A levels for every single JC,btohqsg
Then soon stuff like even the top psle scorer they donâ€™t announce,btohqsg
"anyway its very funny how ""gp bridging for jae students"" became ""hcl people not as good at english""",btohqsg
lol wat u tryna do sia. u sudd text smtg unrelated in here confusing everyone then when called out u tryna push ur own mistake to other ppl.,btohqsg
js putting in my 2 cents,btohqsg
NS life must be so boring for you,btohqsg
don't blame me for your confusion sia.,btohqsg
like its for jae students not hcl studentsi genuinely want to understand how@Jennywawaautomatically came to the conclusion that the bridging was for hcl students...,btohqsg
then blame who sia your mother ah,btohqsg
I wish I can use my WhatsApp stickers here,btohqsg
send him back to pri sch for comprehension skills,btohqsg
@Jennywawacan u explain or not i willing to listen,btohqsg
Hey it wasn't a conclusion. Just a speculation.,btohqsg
nah bro need go kindergarten first budden ltr blud go and teach the kids wrong things,btohqsg
go back to mother womb btr,btohqsg
go back to not even existing,btohqsg
@JennywawaJust so you know   an absolute majority of the IP batch take HCL and none of them are required to go to the GP bridging lesson,btohqsg
Being bad at English is because u are bad at chinese,btohqsg
U cannot be good at both at the same time?,btohqsg
its worse than my jump in logic in my gp papers eh cb,btohqsg
So HCL = bad at gp = need to go for gp bridging makes 0 sense bruh,btohqsg
Bro fr just dragged all the polyglots in the world,btohqsg
oic  so who goes to the GP bridging lessons then?,btohqsg
maybe cuz speaking from his own exp la,btohqsg
bro must be pretty bored tonight,btohqsg
The JAE students... As i have said in my original message...,btohqsg
Apgp is one of the easiest,btohqsg
Ngl I've seen people who are bad at English go for gp asap (or remedial),btohqsg
So you didnâ€™t even read the first msg properlyâ€¦,btohqsg
People who say GP is pure English skill,btohqsg
Will have a very low chance of getting A for GP,btohqsg
I feel like GP is just u need to know how to argue,btohqsg
In the end for a levels you got A?,btohqsg
"Which isn't a skill of ""who is good at language or not""",btohqsg
Some students I know also like that  didnâ€™t like the format the sch gave for essays so just wrote their own style,btohqsg
Those who go for gp bridging are those bad at english like idk man,btohqsg
as in  I was guessing the HCL students among the JAE.,btohqsg
U just need to be understandable,btohqsg
but ok  if it's just all the JAE students then point taken.,btohqsg
theres o level eng class for j1 for ppl who failed eng,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t see your resume earlier  are you like basically one of those hci 90 RPers,btohqsg
cos you can use HCL to replace EL.,btohqsg
Ok but must be still pretty Zai a level results I guess,btohqsg
so like if your EL was bad  you can get in based on HCL. But then you would need help with GP?,btohqsg
what if u get an A1 for Hcl,btohqsg
I think can use hcl as L1,btohqsg
then they also need go gp bridging,btohqsg
then I would assume you don't need to go for the GP bridging,btohqsg
gp bridging is ALL JAE need to go,btohqsg
iirc HCl students can minus extra pts,btohqsg
this is the part i'm confused by LOL,btohqsg
oh ok  sorry I must have missed that part then.,btohqsg
with the amount of mental gymnastics youre pulling,btohqsg
he needs to go for gp bridging,btohqsg
Even if they pass it's more than enough to minus by x amt of pts  iirc,btohqsg
With all due respect pls just stop  I think the more you talk about this the more youâ€™re making a fool of yourself,btohqsg
which she said in bold earlier,btohqsg
I hope I donâ€™t have to retake a levels  the brain rot is super bad,btohqsg
Forgot so much stuff from having not studied in close to 3 months,btohqsg
wah this whole convo confuses me,btohqsg
im going to go back to marking gp essays,btohqsg
go back to doing wtv you're doing,btohqsg
we can talk about smth else,btohqsg
marking gp essays is not any better,btohqsg
actl i should ask my teacher about gp bridging lol,btohqsg
i see the same level of logic,btohqsg
marking essays you can just call it out,btohqsg
Wah you still taking up students,btohqsg
this one a bit more tiring,btohqsg
Religion is not relevant today because there are less people who are religious,btohqsg
the ones you'd send are fking funny,btohqsg
"idk i also feel people dek what ""liberal"" ""left"" means",btohqsg
"everytime i see people use the word ""liberal"" i just feel like throwing them into a wall",btohqsg
"""For example  with the rise of Covid-19  it has proved that religion could not help improve the situation even if they pray for an improvement in the situation. Therefore religion is not relevant""",btohqsg
Yâ€™all have more faith in me than I myself,btohqsg
ngl i feel anyone who writes a religion essay,btohqsg
cuz singaporeans dont know any religions,btohqsg
Just smoking stuff to meet the word count,btohqsg
Same I feel ppl hv alot more faith in me than I do in myselfðŸ’€,btohqsg
Yours is too low level alr  at least I think I can be confident of getting at least one A,btohqsg
I think you going to be like 90 or near 90,btohqsg
how fuck all did u went sia,btohqsg
i was confident in like 0 As for A levels,btohqsg
i was very confident i would get an A for chem,btohqsg
cuz i knew the whole batch fucked up,btohqsg
I feel like Iâ€™ll get 80-85 but Iâ€™ll see  I take an arts stream combi so a most of the marking is very subjective,btohqsg
and even tho i fucked up,btohqsg
i know i didnt fuck up as bad as others,btohqsg
cuz arts is pure skill its either u have it or u dont,btohqsg
Wdym  as in ppl who estimate their scores?,btohqsg
Sciences u can get by through last minute pounding,btohqsg
ur prelim is more or less ur,btohqsg
then sci can mug tys what,btohqsg
or it's just the moderation shifting ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
H1 history is the easiest to spot,btohqsg
why everyone be complaining abt geog man,btohqsg
in tm is cuz of the cher,btohqsg
I think my math a level score is almost twice my prelim score haha,btohqsg
new h2 hist is harder than new h2 geog,btohqsg
last time used to be q even,btohqsg
theres declining good quality geog chers arnd singapore,btohqsg
i heard new h1 is ~30-40% of h2,btohqsg
ac abt to lose their one gd geog cher,btohqsg
If I retake maybe I should just take h2 history old syllabus and drop geog to h1,btohqsg
cuz she trying to retire asap,btohqsg
ej also going to lose theirs next yr,btohqsg
I hope a new and better one comes in fast,btohqsg
The other one is not good,btohqsg
But this guy knows a lot of stuff about other schs,btohqsg
i know alot of people but alot of people dont know me,btohqsg
Pls come save the ac geog department after ns,btohqsg
sorry ej alr ask me go back,btohqsg
Just come for 2 years maybe,btohqsg
I think you can make enough changes to carry the dept,btohqsg
and human aspects of climat change,btohqsg
urban geog is damn fun tho,btohqsg
i praying it dont come out,btohqsg
yall keesiao why yall jn arguing abt jae students going for bridging in an IP sch,btohqsg
At least you taking the new geog syllabus,btohqsg
Being in HCL means u MUST go for gp bridging,btohqsg
every sch in sg teaches that,btohqsg
if u dont have it it kinda becomes u suck,btohqsg
but idt its really really necessasry,btohqsg
You also never read the convo properly,btohqsg
everything that schs teach is cause fomo,btohqsg
its why every sch is like,btohqsg
"""Oh youre not evaluating enough for GP""",btohqsg
literally never said anything abt it,btohqsg
the deep ocean currents shit or wtv,btohqsg
ya cuz as the ice melts less diff betw the temp,btohqsg
thermohaline is an imaginary line that separates the hot and cold water,btohqsg
also abt salinity of water right,btohqsg
wait randkmdkd also took geog at alvl ?,btohqsg
cuz thats where thermo comes from,btohqsg
salinity is more of like a,btohqsg
it came abt as a result,btohqsg
its like the impact of the temperature difference,btohqsg
So i always explain thermohaline itself as the boundary between hot and cold water by definition,btohqsg
but other ways of identifying it would be like salinity etc. la,btohqsg
but u need to also think hor is salinity even impt anot cuz ur studying thermohaline in relation to climate change,btohqsg
i jst rmb as cold more saline water sink,btohqsg
so should focus more on temperature,btohqsg
i feeling dumb as hell rn,btohqsg
this is what i mean by irrelevent informaton in sch notes,btohqsg
EJC last time used to teach every single indicator,btohqsg
then i talked to the hod of geog abt it,btohqsg
and argued that it wasnt necessary,btohqsg
Is it common to already start thinking about the dream job you want to get into?,btohqsg
If only the new rp system started one year earlier  you wonâ€™t have to worry about this,btohqsg
how am i taking a lvl this yr,btohqsg
There's this guy with a bowling tick,btohqsg
But if you had to go to NS can just wait one more admission cycle,btohqsg
As in can throw away h1 content,btohqsg
idt i will get worse than C,btohqsg
cuz i srly got high standard for geog alrd,btohqsg
If u do get worse than c,btohqsg
U will be the second person ik who get less than c for geog,btohqsg
I think even if you smoke can easily get B,btohqsg
Bro if u get e for geog,btohqsg
No reason  just curious. Everyone's here pretty serious about A levels.,btohqsg
U will be the first person ik who got D for gdog,btohqsg
ahh i mean same yea i do that sometimes too...,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just h1 geog lol  a lot of seniors I heard of in my shh didnâ€™t study much still can get A,btohqsg
idw smth too sciency or arts,btohqsg
brb guys i need to write gp essays,btohqsg
someone is paying me $34 per gp essay i write,btohqsg
And it puts things in perspectives  as someone soon to grad from uni(last term),btohqsg
Like up till prelims still getting bad grades,btohqsg
Cos they donâ€™t rly have a clue on what theyâ€™re doing,btohqsg
cuz i got A for promos,btohqsg
based on my experience  people only start thinking after a level results,btohqsg
its very posible to jump from U in geog to A,btohqsg
Then my teacher was like no way this batch gonna do well  end up 40+% A for h1 geog,btohqsg
is it just you on yourself...,btohqsg
I mean h1 dist rate is normally lower than h2 for all subjects what,btohqsg
Maybe ejc no h1 students so you wonâ€™t know,btohqsg
idk in ej its the otherway arnd,btohqsg
single digit A n b or smth,btohqsg
we have more h1 students than h2 students for some subject,btohqsg
So whatâ€™s the dist rate for h1 geog,btohqsg
Oh it's a tic? Except bowling,btohqsg
force many h2 students to drop,btohqsg
From what ik for my batch,btohqsg
But the real qn is if it's actual bowling technique,btohqsg
I think my sch dist rate for h2 math is typically around 55%  but h1 math is 30+%,btohqsg
but like idk la i just gonna,btohqsg
do my best w what i can,btohqsg
Is it the bottom 20% drop thing,btohqsg
I studied 1 day before physics a lvl,btohqsg
If not a few days before,btohqsg
read the slides figure out wtf the actually impt stuff,btohqsg
they just force people to drop,btohqsg
they make the paper incredibly hard,btohqsg
so that we have majority Us and Ss,btohqsg
so students will be demoralised to drop,btohqsg
Oh ok I heard from my ej friend that they ask all those in the bottom 20% taking 4H2 to drop one H2,btohqsg
then u will auto drop 1,btohqsg
But cuz the papers are damn difficult,btohqsg
most of the cohort would have 2 Us,btohqsg
i rmbr for chem it was like any mispelling of a word including a non-keyword would warrant the whole part getting 0,btohqsg
I guess they just very strict to scare students,btohqsg
I used the word regardless of instead of if,btohqsg
they gave my whole thing 0,btohqsg
Do any of yall know of anyone who took h2 geog and h2 history for a levels in one sitting and got both A,btohqsg
Ik one student from NY who did that,btohqsg
needed you to prove my validity,btohqsg
Only acjc and nyjc allows students to take both without any restrictions  sajc allows but MUST be GHEm,btohqsg
Ohh I thought you mean she got both A for prelims  not just she took both subs,btohqsg
In the 2022 acjc batch I know got 2 such students  but neither of them got both A,btohqsg
Closest was h2 geog A but h2 history C,btohqsg
One nus law guy got that lol,btohqsg
Wow nice  which sch was he from?,btohqsg
I thought sajc only started offering that GHEm combi more recently,btohqsg
I think History and geog got model answer can alr,btohqsg
You sure itâ€™s not one of them is H2 and the other H1?,btohqsg
Iinw 2019 that combi wasnâ€™t out yet,btohqsg
So if the student took both geog and history one of them must have been a h1,btohqsg
For me geog I memorise for A laso,btohqsg
Yeah both h2 knew him personally,btohqsg
Wow rly nice  I know now thereâ€™s at least one such example of taking both and getting A,btohqsg
thres so many undeserving 90RPs out thr,btohqsg
I think my group just chose a bad topic,btohqsg
That's why he got nus law n I rejected 3 times lol,btohqsg
oh   i would say there are many underserving scholars out there also,btohqsg
it becomes like so unconsequential nowadays,btohqsg
At least under the new system you wouldâ€™ve gotten a perfect rp,btohqsg
That indian guy in your unit,btohqsg
I knew someone who told me,btohqsg
I deserve to be a scholar cuz im from RI,btohqsg
Now I'm in consulting arguably more fun than law lol,btohqsg
No didnâ€™t you see what he said about him,btohqsg
Idk if pay better than law long run tho,btohqsg
cuz he was sulking that he got rejected,btohqsg
from the same scholarship as me,btohqsg
and he said i was just an ej student,btohqsg
yeah im just an ej student,btohqsg
But actl alevel I studied vv ineffiently lol,btohqsg
I rmb I did all the jc prelim paper like for 3 years or smth,btohqsg
Some ppl anyhow study or barely study do much better than those who studied way harder,btohqsg
Most RI students ik have this,btohqsg
Idk if itâ€™s just me but I feel that HCI students tend to be more humble than ri,btohqsg
aptitude > attitude in the sense that udn study as hard,btohqsg
Ri arts students have insane writing speed lol,btohqsg
U write 2 side they write 5 side liao,btohqsg
if they have insane writing speed,btohqsg
then idk what my writing speed is,btohqsg
Does your handwriting get rly ugly when you write fast though,btohqsg
i still have some of my gp exam papers lying arnd,btohqsg
its better than some peoples normal writing speed,btohqsg
Oh well so I guess at least you didnâ€™t have to worry about whether Cambridge examiners can read your handwriting,btohqsg
Some ppl I know of they get like B/C for a levels arts subjects even though their prelims was like A  and they suspect itâ€™s a handwriting issue,btohqsg
If a levels did at least reveal the exact marks of each student and the grade boundaries (just like IB) then would be easier to tell,btohqsg
no for ur case i do,btohqsg
Thing is some of them were likely consistently in the top quintile for all internal exams then suddenly A levels is a C,btohqsg
yea there's like a line to draw here,btohqsg
"""write legibly so the marker can see your beautiful thoughts or smth""",btohqsg
even if you gave me your script i wouldn't be able to cheat off it,btohqsg
Maybe some of them legit screwed up their As but canâ€™t be all given their prior good performance,btohqsg
i feel acjc marking q inconsistent,btohqsg
Yalor. At least UK a levels reveal the exact grade boundaries for all papers,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not just my sch tho,btohqsg
Iâ€™m talking about cases from vjc and ejc,btohqsg
Like I know of ppl who internal exams almost always A but come a levels B/C,btohqsg
the past 3 years there was one drop to B,btohqsg
but its cause she blanked out for one essaay,btohqsg
its probably the worst in singapore,btohqsg
He always A in internal exams but a levels B,btohqsg
I actually dk how they fuck up so much,btohqsg
Do you know what was it for 2021?,btohqsg
Wow so even despite that BOP fiasco  the results were still pretty decent,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s like on par with hci/ri,btohqsg
They also normally say their Econs dist rate is around 60%,btohqsg
Only ri students should be scholars!!!,btohqsg
Hci is the 4th China  Singapore is the 3rd,btohqsg
i only know 1 who is my upperstudy,btohqsg
and i think hes pretty decent person,btohqsg
apart from the fact that he stole my things,btohqsg
But pretty incredible for your sch to produce Econs results that are on par with hci/ri despite the crappy dept,btohqsg
i suspect we have very little Bs,btohqsg
I thought even other schs with the same cut off didnâ€™t have an Econs dist rate thatâ€™s as high,btohqsg
ej has very little students in tuition,btohqsg
of the 3 classes im close to,btohqsg
That probably applies more to dhs,btohqsg
Acjc Econs dist rate is always very crappy,btohqsg
I think it was 29% for 2022,btohqsg
but its no where near ac,btohqsg
So despite being one point better for each stream Acjcâ€™s results are so much worse,btohqsg
idk why ej is dropping tbf,btohqsg
Wait its only one year off,btohqsg
Probably new campus and good results,btohqsg
At least itâ€™s comparable to nyjc/vjc,btohqsg
I think you need to see other sch campuses in order to appreciate ej campus more,btohqsg
Njc seems to be the worst,btohqsg
alot of chers hypothesising that this year we will severely underperform for a levels,btohqsg
I suppose once you get the data can update us,btohqsg
For acjc they normally only give more detailed data on the dist rate for each subject during like founders day or some other service,btohqsg
But I suppose you can ask the ej geog teachers and they wonâ€™t mind telling,btohqsg
Like exactly how many students get each grade,btohqsg
Whether I choose to say it here,btohqsg
Maybe just say the dist rate I guess,btohqsg
Or round it off to the nearest 10 just like you did for Econs,btohqsg
Nvm I realised that will be considered moonlighting,btohqsg
I wish I could do that,btohqsg
its not moonlighting unless u get cf,btohqsg
according to some hr dxo from my camp,btohqsg
Sry cos I deleted the msg just now,btohqsg
idk i just get paid to write essays,btohqsg
Do you want to see my brotherâ€™s dissertation and offer some critique,btohqsg
I couldnâ€™t understand 95% of what he wrote there lol cos my English sucks,btohqsg
im friends with the nus linguistic faculty,btohqsg
if its smth i would enjoy reading then sure,btohqsg
Like studying sentence structures I think,btohqsg
A lot of it is very technical,btohqsg
yeah i co-wrote a linguistics paper,btohqsg
but idk the status of its publication,btohqsg
I think si yan said he can write better with his foot lol,btohqsg
My handwriting is pretty crappy too,btohqsg
i can probably write better with my mouth,btohqsg
i do not remember my handwriting,btohqsg
i'd be willing to put money on this,btohqsg
can i digress for a moment,btohqsg
when i see people on telehitch,btohqsg
generally if their username is like the xmm kind,btohqsg
as in their dad walked out,btohqsg
They no aircon in every class,btohqsg
Even the old jjc campus had aircon in every class,btohqsg
OMG EJC has no aircon in some classes,btohqsg
I thought with a $100 million + budget all classes wouldâ€™ve had,btohqsg
thrs 4 levels of classes with no aircon,btohqsg
its because of how tall ej is,btohqsg
the 4 non ac classes are,btohqsg
my hr guy say its not,btohqsg
Tbh if moe needed more IP schs  shouldâ€™ve just converted existing ones instead of creating a new one,btohqsg
Merging schs while creating a new sch is quite stupid,btohqsg
I think nyjc shouldâ€™ve been converted,btohqsg
the whole loophole thing was some of the funniest entertainment i've gotten from sge in a while,btohqsg
Ngl I think the new principal would be very excited if moe announced during his tenure that nyjc will be a new IP sch,btohqsg
In fact I would think he wants it,btohqsg
Bro don't make me question my Chinese standards like yhat,btohqsg
I had to Google translate it,btohqsg
Since my Chinese is so rabak,btohqsg
But since I get a normal result in English I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s off,btohqsg
Oh so heâ€™s just over complicating stuff,btohqsg
I feel like sending this to,btohqsg
My friends thats gud at chi,btohqsg
It literally translates to movable device lol,btohqsg
Unless I can view on a web browser without creating an account,btohqsg
Actually can but I need the link in the first place,btohqsg
I suppose now producers can make an entire animated movie without hiring any animators,btohqsg
Oh well I hope moe doesnâ€™t replace teachers with robots,btohqsg
Maybe a realistic humanoid robot can come close to that,btohqsg
But if it comes to the point robot can replace teachers in schs they would have probably replaced pretty much almost every job we have now,btohqsg
At the speed things are advancing  maybe this could be possible within 20 years?,btohqsg
Weâ€™d never know until if and when it comes I guess,btohqsg
There are some chatbots now that are so realistic  there are reports of people getting attached to them,btohqsg
and it is still so dumb,btohqsg
I can imagine ppl in Japan creating holograms of anime figures,btohqsg
the more i use it  the more i appreciate human intelligence,btohqsg
Then combining it with the capability to speak,btohqsg
I mean this has alr happened but one that is able to respond to speech using a chatbot  idk of any yet,btohqsg
by then you are better off doing it yourself alr,btohqsg
Im quite sure thatâ€™s possible now but not many will use it,btohqsg
Like theyâ€™re just typing on air,btohqsg
Even AI headsets can give you that experience,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s actually a guy in Japan who married a hologram,btohqsg
Time to update it with a chatbot lol,btohqsg
More Japanese men going to fall for the holograms if they can interact,btohqsg
Then birth rate gonna fall further,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s far fetched,btohqsg
Even if the response is not very human itâ€™ll be human enough to satisfy some,btohqsg
depends on where the threshold for these people are,btohqsg
if you're able to be satisfied by current bots then,btohqsg
Some ppl in Japan like that guy who married a the hologram rly hated dealing with real life girls cos they said he was bullied by them when he was younger,btohqsg
So even that would be a good enough substitute,btohqsg
I mean like most probably wouldnâ€™t go that low but like thereâ€™s enough ppl,btohqsg
yea so there's the other issues,btohqsg
anyway the hologram thing is no diff from those people that marry anime waifus,btohqsg
But anyway itâ€™s definitely true that a hologram with the capability to interact can be created now,btohqsg
At least this one they have something more realistic because they can interact and see it,btohqsg
you can stick a voice to a 3d model of anything even the anime characters,btohqsg
the hologram part doesn't matter bc it's just a display on a screen still even tho it doesn't look like it,btohqsg
Yeah true itâ€™s still not tangible,btohqsg
Ppl gonna develop apps on headsets for that,btohqsg
that's the entire reddit after dark,btohqsg
but like maybe the headset can make the other person look way better,btohqsg
But like maybe they can create a separate device like what YT said,btohqsg
Prob some level of implants is necessary,btohqsg
Not enough to just wear something,btohqsg
Tbh  if researchers were more unethical and more resources were poured into implants/body mods  I don't think it's too implausible,btohqsg
It's just that this sort of research moves at a glacial pace with little funding,btohqsg
we donâ€™t even fully understand the brain so weâ€™d have to start with that,btohqsg
