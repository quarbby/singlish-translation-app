Many new cars have 4 seats too,btohqsg
Donâ€™t make excuses for Lambo to shortchange u,btohqsg
A huracan doesn't? Does that mean Lambo shortchanged them?,btohqsg
U donâ€™t come n compare Apple to orange,btohqsg
Yeah lah  so you compare performance car to performance car what,btohqsg
You tell me which supercar got HUD,btohqsg
It is not shortchanging. Many new cars still donâ€™t have no?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s all on the spec sheet then you buy.,btohqsg
U donno doesnâ€™t mean donâ€™t have,btohqsg
U 2 Donâ€™t spoilt the mkt by compromising,btohqsg
Itâ€™s clearly stated. Short change is when they say itâ€™s there  then not there when you take delivery.,btohqsg
Y donâ€™t the 2 of u request donâ€™t want everything,btohqsg
Because that's what most buyers of that car pay for,btohqsg
U can make the car seats urself right,btohqsg
U don even need the door,btohqsg
Not at all. I do like how you place HUD as number one priority on your own shopping list. To many  it is mainly a good to have option.,btohqsg
Ok among the top. Sorry I stand corrected.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not even among the top,btohqsg
Becos u r forsaking basic things in Lambo n even justify for them,btohqsg
Not at all sir. Iâ€™m saying for other car makes too. There is a purpose for each installation and each buyer has his own list of whatâ€™s important or not. For example if the careful buyer does want to be up for a $1-2k min replacement cost on a unit he doesnâ€™t really need then he may be ok without it.,btohqsg
I wish they did  then I would use that money to buy a Lambo myself,btohqsg
A bit like soft close mechanisms. It is nice to have but replacement cost of each is about $600-900 depending on car make and model.,btohqsg
i would like to remind you  some porsche GT doesnt even come with doorhandles,btohqsg
Short change is to me maybe â€¦ buying a new Porsche and getting maybe only 4 cylinders.. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
For a Lambo a high tech futuristic car  y do u want to compromise on basic stuffs? Stop spoiling the mkt n shortchange urself.,btohqsg
Wahahah but we do need to move with times.,btohqsg
