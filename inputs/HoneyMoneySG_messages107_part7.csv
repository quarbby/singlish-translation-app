Dont get what u mean by 1k cap as cardup does not qualify for those 4mpd card bonus point. U need to choose the best base miles card for cardup and those have no cap,btohqsg
Use this webpage to check which card can earn how many miles per dollar.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to check OCBC cash back? I have been using frank for almost a decade totally forgot about the cash back,btohqsg
Anyone signed up for UOB big savings payout promo on 30th Apr?Wanna ask if your fund been earmark yet?,btohqsg
Its decent. The welcome bonus of 20 000k miles for paying annual fee is good. The earn rates of 1.2/2.4mpd is comparable to other cards. But I got it because the points will soon pool with HSBC Revo.Given the low earn rates of General Spend cards  I want it to pool with my existing cards. If you are in UOB ecosystem  Privimiles seems good as well,btohqsg
What I meant was that the card up platform is used to pair with certain miles credit cards. So if the cap for the max amount miles I can earn in a month is relatively low  then I need to find a credit card which has a higher cap.Not sure whether I got this logic correct. üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone here just apply Maybank platinum card just to pay monthly income tax payment to get the cash back?,btohqsg
It is not use to pair with certain miles card  they just have different promo for different type of card? I dont exactly get you,btohqsg
Is it worth to convert sgd to usd and participate in the webull 8.4% promotion?,btohqsg

Hi all  what I don‚Äôt understand here is how to make payment using Maybank platinum card for Tax payment? I need to pair with cardup?,btohqsg
Hi all  one more question: If my insurance payment is $1000 and I spend $150 on other eligible transaction. Do I still consider eligible for cashback ?,btohqsg
U only get the 300 tier cashback not the 1k,btohqsg
Yes. $30 cashback for that quarter if you also spend at least $300 for the 2 other months.,btohqsg
If my monthly income tax payment is 1k  will I get cash back of 100 per quarter?,btohqsg
Yes  if via cardup. Card up is consider normal transaction,btohqsg
Hi  my understanding is credit cards only givebasemiles on those transactions charged using cardup. I am not aware of any credit cards that have cap on maximumbasemiles you can earn per month.Eg. UOB VS has 0.4 base miles n 3.6 bonus miles = 4miles.You only get 0.4 mile per dollar via cardup..,btohqsg
Thanks  also need to change from giro to card payment mode in Iras side  any idea how long does the whole process take ?,btohqsg
whats a good card to use after the 1k cap on citi rewards mastercard + amaze?,btohqsg
No. Keep the GIRO. CardUp has instructions on how to setup payments.,btohqsg
Thanks. So first step is to apply Maybank card first  correct ?,btohqsg
There is plenty of card but really boil down to your spending habit,btohqsg
Yes  got for other card in maybank for the extra bonus first then get platinum visa,btohqsg
I have Maybank family and friends card already  normally spending charge to Uob one card  this is just for income tax payment which currently just giro from my bank acct,btohqsg
Ya then go for my bank platinum visa,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find the referral code here due to too many messages  can someone pls share Maybank platinum card referral or promotion code ?,btohqsg

Anyone have any tips on how to clock the spend for the latest Grab PowerUp challenge?,btohqsg

Anyone used dbs app bill option to pay other bank credit card and pay using dbs credit card? Does dbs charge any cash advance fees?,btohqsg
Just use on sgqr+ at hawker,btohqsg
I am not sure about DBS but Citi does. I think it's a pretty common fee to charge for cash advance (like withdrawing from an ATM ),btohqsg
Use Amex pay. So many people crying here over xnap demise. Will a new hero arise ?,btohqsg
hey there was a way to RENAME your UOB cards right?for example change the name from UOB One toAh Gong supp card,btohqsg
ok found it..Must be done on DESKTOP BANKING..Customise Settings,btohqsg
Didn't know this is actually a possibility ... üò±,btohqsg

so i have things likeA own UOB LadyA supp B UOB LadyB supp A UOB Lady,btohqsg
I think most of the online banking can,btohqsg
Hi all  I have an upcoming spend of about $4000 on air tickets. May i know what cards do you all recommend to get the best sign up offers based on this spend?Some considerations- entire $4000 will be spent one shot using this card- prefer cashback over miles but not a hard rule- ok not to use this card after this purchase and cancel it 1-2 years later when any annual fee kicks in,btohqsg
*Regarding OCBC 360 Spending Criteria*Sorry  I just watched this video and learnt that CardUp is not part of the exclusion list for OCBC 90N.May I confirm:Based on the OCBC 360 T&C  seems like CardUp (Tax Payment) transactions via OCBC 90N are eligible for the $500 credit card spending requirement (since CardUp is not part of exclusion list of OCBC 90N).,btohqsg
nope did not receive anything too,btohqsg
Does anyone here hold a hsbc premier acc via 15k monthly crediting? May I know if the min balance is 5k or 15k? I‚Äôm quite sure it‚Äôs 5k  but when I went to open another joint acc the cso insisted it‚Äôs 15k. Hence wondering if any tnc changed on minimum account balance,btohqsg
Ah ok  thought 2k is for normal acc. If premier is also 2k  that‚Äôs great thanks!,btohqsg
No aunty. Premier account don‚Äôt have fall below fees,btohqsg
yup.. MINIMUM balance to avoid fall below fee is always $2k regardless your tierthe $15k inflow per month or $200k AUM are criteria to maintain Premier Banking.,btohqsg
