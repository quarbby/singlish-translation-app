Basic oil change should be about $100 to $125 for the fit I believe,btohqsg
Apart from that your battery and alternator must check with them,btohqsg
Malaysia is not drastically cheaper for a basic oil change  especially when you consider the costs of driving over and the tolls etc.,btohqsg
Might be slightly cheaper for the parts that you want to change though,btohqsg
I called the car battery company and they believe it’s the actuator problem and not the battery. Then again my battery is 1.5 years   need to change soon,btohqsg
Ooo how much is a Honda fit actuator and battery if want to replace tho?,btohqsg
I think you ask your workshop to advise you instead,btohqsg
Because part and labour costs best coming from them,btohqsg
Don't just blindly trust one place,btohqsg
Once you get the quote from one place,btohqsg
Call another and ask for a price,btohqsg
Bro dont service every 10k  do it arnd every 8k. Yr car will thank you,btohqsg
Sometimes need diy  battery go workshop A  servicing go workshop B to get cheaper price. That’s what I did.,btohqsg
It’s like doing renovation. Get main con to manage everything for you  or find Subcon to do the specific work,btohqsg
Huh really? Never get a call leh,btohqsg

There’s another way to look at it. Sometimes people will draw you in with Low price and then suddenly… oh sorry there’s still sound… CHANGE AND BUY NEW WKWKWKWKWKWKWKWK,btohqsg
Price.. although important … can’t be the only factor to base a decision on,btohqsg
