3.7L road tax + FC will discourage them,btohqsg
No problem leh. For the Ultimate Cool YP woot woot.,btohqsg
anyways  yeah i wanted an S40 because its probably the cheapest to work on. For example stage 3 + manual swap. Manual swap is much easier on this P2 cars because most S40 with the 2.0T overseas come with a manual gearbox  so parts are easily accesible.Plus the 2.0T shares the same engine block as the 2.3 2.4 and 2.5L  so the engine block is actually durable unlike the 2.5L S60r/V70r or the more commonly seen XC90 2.5T. The 2.5L tend to have a crack engine block because Volvo decided to cut cost and just bore the cylinders without stroking hence the cylinder walls are actually very thin. Modding the 2.0T would therefore probably be the most reliable in making large amounts of power at its limit.Also P2 generation is much easier to work on compared to P3.,btohqsg
that’s a lot to digest  Mr Volvo,btohqsg
ya sia. but that’s why JX is Mr Volvo for a reason😉,btohqsg
The Mr Mazda here prefers regular Mazdas I think,btohqsg
then what is our dear sgcm admin? 😝,btohqsg
I see that you too love the apex seal destroyer,btohqsg
Maybe should go for high roaring engine,btohqsg
You are legit godsend for Volvo Mr Xun!!! you are truly THE undisputed #1 VS Angel 🥰,btohqsg
HAHA tldr  i want a s40 but i no money,btohqsg
yeah mann  i will tell you the secret next time😉😉,btohqsg
You’re probably gonna tell me it’s good looks  good genes or good brains. None of the above I have 🤣🤣,btohqsg
haha i saw one on SGCM but its an NA  i wld prefer turbo so that i can zhng hehe,btohqsg
But tht 2.4L in the V50 is actually very sought after overseas. Most S60r/V70r will swap to the more durable 2.4L after their 2.5L engine block crack.,btohqsg
Where got Mr Anwo! You are smart  handsome and hardworking... THATS THE SECRET!,btohqsg
Honestly the 2.0T is strong enough. Just hybrid turbo and do supporting mods  easy 350hp,btohqsg
Obviously manual swap too cos the auto gb is dog💩,btohqsg
For our Mr Volvo. Super cool leh this ride.,btohqsg
that made my day (even though we both know that's not true)!!!,btohqsg
I shan't even pretend to understand what the two of you are talking about 😉,btohqsg
LOL haha just upgrade to 16T,btohqsg
i see many people upgrade to 19T but the engine definitely cant handle the power,btohqsg
19T is rated for 500hp which the engine block will never make😂😂,btohqsg
Tempting for a saab too 😂,btohqsg
I saw some rich kor kors going to the recent Porsche event at mbs,btohqsg
They had Garrett popcorn there apparently,btohqsg
Any of those rich kor kors here?,btohqsg
