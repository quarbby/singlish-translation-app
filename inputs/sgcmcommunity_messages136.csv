Always amazed at how you do it,btohqsg
But I am blessed and thankful that I can break my fast on time every year,btohqsg
To be fair it’s about not drinking hahahhaa,btohqsg
best civic to get for 1st car ?,btohqsg
Ee met one unprofessional dealership . Car under his consignment but he never see car before,btohqsg
I ever encounter a pmd travelled faster than me at 60km/hr,btohqsg
I think govt should grant immunity to drivers in accident with pmd if the latter are illegally riding on the road. That would put such riders in place.,btohqsg
Sometimes what we need is ENFORCEMENT,btohqsg
got one time the certis kick the PMD down but he got fired,btohqsg
If not its a cat n mouse game,btohqsg
But now the mouse is the enforcers,btohqsg
Our law protect too well even for offenders. That’s why,btohqsg
Also explains why foreigners damn to be arrogant even in the wrong. Like cyclists,btohqsg

2k to lower abit and feel more uncomfortable…,btohqsg
You ask how to make your car look nicer,btohqsg
I asking price not 0 down laaa,btohqsg
Coils will make it look nicer,btohqsg
But not comfortable and later hump will scratch right,btohqsg
I’m left with 3k budget for my car excluding the bodykit,btohqsg
I don’t pay things in installment because of debt trap  I rather fork out cash from my saving,btohqsg
Only thing I willing to pay via installment is car,btohqsg
LOL you clearly haven’t seen my civic,btohqsg
I just gonna ignore your messages le,btohqsg
I see they say damping soft and hard  should go max soft ah? So more comfortable,btohqsg
Or just do good uv rejection and heat rejection tints?,btohqsg
So you change then test then change,btohqsg
Why not put bed also inside your “bba”,btohqsg
Max soft is not really comfy,btohqsg
I think that's why he wants the curtains,btohqsg
Just FYI my front seat can go until super low and flat  like lying on a bed,btohqsg

Im talking abt to enter mscp,btohqsg
Some older mscp the gradient is steep,btohqsg
Why is parking orientation determined by country?,btohqsg
Because we have less space to be able to park nose in and leave safely,btohqsg
That’s a space issue. Not a country issue.,btohqsg
Also because Americans have a skill issue  their parking skills are appalling,btohqsg
Only in states ppl park head in,btohqsg
Last i remembered everyone else is vertical,btohqsg
But in US they need to cus most of them drives a stationwagon last time,btohqsg
Oh  mine has a pretty tight and steep turn  but I would say only those with lousy skill can’t go thru it without scratching,btohqsg
No reason for them to do it but they do it anyway,btohqsg
Sometimes I do if the space is directly in front of the ramp or gantry haha,btohqsg
Yea I realise sometimes I wanna do nose in for easy loading at shopping mall  can’t do it,btohqsg

Since I pick up the car since 1st feb till now   I nv wash,btohqsg
My friend say from black already turn gray,btohqsg
The only thing I wash is the wheels 🤣,btohqsg
I thinkFzwill be there to give further money saving tips,btohqsg
Come home just drizzle sonax shampoo over it. Let it soak overnight. Next day when drive  rain will help rinse off until shiny and clean.,btohqsg
Mine got “glass coating “ so no need soap 🤣,btohqsg
Everyday  pay the MSCP $50 monthly and when I park at night they will wash,btohqsg
Detailing once every 2 months for $190,btohqsg
Mine also  maybe different for people and I got discount who knows?I park at night once a while only anyway  most days either I’m working night shift or at night I go out for drive,btohqsg
Dk why i always kena mud splatter,btohqsg
The people come wash ur car mon to fri  $50 a month,btohqsg
not full on wash  like clean with water and wipe lor,btohqsg
2017-2019I paid only $40/mth.Now $50/mthMon/Tues/Thur/FriAnd not clean. Only 4 swipe. Left/right/front/rear. No roof.🤦‍♂,btohqsg
A deep clean takes abt an hr solo,btohqsg
If u go outside wash and they got like 5 people in msia,btohqsg
Is true not clean  their water recycle on many car anywayBut for me because I drive a lot  especially back when I did grab a lot  my car would always come back with alot of dirt  dust  mud  birdshit and water stain.Sooo for me quite worth la to just get rid of those things everyday,btohqsg
Much more value if you just jet your car then wipe,btohqsg
I’m don’t like washing my own car one LOL. I jet only rims or bird shit sometimes. Other than that  if I jet car they always leave water spot  not willing to get wet and sweaty to wipe the car,btohqsg
I mean if it’s a big sum then it’s different la  but $50 for a month / $10 per wash at petrol kiosk  is minuscule compared to the amount of money you spend on car or even food,btohqsg

Hi guys  would like to seek some advice here.I’ve bought a new Nissan Serena last week but my wife dislike the car alot. Any idea how do i minimize lost if i were to sell it or trade in now?,btohqsg
Should have brought wife to see the car together…. But now that it’s done  most you can do is probably direct sale or consignment at least you can list it to whatever you want. Rule78 boh bian really  just pay and take it as a lesson.Else just convince your wife arh  car she pay one meh  she willing to absorb cost meh. End of day is Point ABA,btohqsg
Should buy anti thief lug nut?,btohqsg
I won't be surprised got traders trade coe like stock market. Govt should give 1 mth for traders to register coe to a car after every bid  otherwise pour back to the coe pool  instead of 6mths.,btohqsg
Wa bro the moment car leaves dealership  it depreciates like mad,btohqsg
This is why sometimes buy car better bring wifey along,btohqsg
If ur passenger princess dont like gg,btohqsg
Ur gna hear her niam niam niam away as long as she sits in the car,btohqsg
Lol its quite silly to sell the car within a month of buying just because someone in the family dun like the car... there's grab  shariot etc but seriously  she should learn to like the car. Unless you need to burn money.,btohqsg
I wud like to say buy car easy. Sell at a gooood price difficult,btohqsg
Prob is i bring her along n initially she said ok but after driving for couple of days she keeps nagging at me and ask me to sell it,btohqsg
Another suggestion is rent it under drive lah  users would be very happy to rent it. Then you can buy another car that your wife likes.,btohqsg
What dors she not like? Car too big? Bo badge?,btohqsg
Luckily mine doesn’t complain  no car also can… I’m the one that’s complaining about it,btohqsg
wa bro if u keep it up this way gna end up like me,btohqsg
I’m already planning for my next car in 4 years time LOL,btohqsg
Lol if me I won't consider to sell at all cos the moment I take over the car I lost 10 over k liao,btohqsg
My new pay just got announced yesterday  thinking what to buy when my interest payment not too high le,btohqsg
Haha yea  but unfortunately his wife gg think buy car like buy clothes can anytime sell and buy,btohqsg
Reason is car too big  no tech  very troublesome to take things from rear so on and so forth,btohqsg
Ya somemore i alrdy done full ppf n auto tailgate etc,btohqsg
GG so she expecting what? Rolls Royce level?,btohqsg
Cz my previous car was a Avante and she thinks avante is more tech savvy,btohqsg
Tell her no money la  if she know you can afford to do so  she will have that kinda mindsetShow her the amount of money you would lose from selling and buying  and ask if she wanna fork out or not,btohqsg
i think someone c her in a serena,btohqsg
Avante got the digital cluster  so maybe that one?,btohqsg
Avante is really lucky for its price to have a digital cluster honestly,btohqsg
I mean that time I said so too  I didn’t buy jap cuz tech so low level for the price.Audi full digital cockpit  MMI system etc was what made me chose it,btohqsg
She likes honda jazz  perodua etc....or the electric egg car shares forgot what's the name...the one that renters keep buang one,btohqsg
Even till now no regret  will choose digital cockpit over analog gauges,btohqsg
Aiya sometimes ppl forget car is a big purchase. Cannot suka suka change de,btohqsg
Tell her at least let u drive a yr,btohqsg
Sometimes its not the car nor the person,btohqsg
Maybe you and her should lay more egg  then can use excuse that you need big car for babies,btohqsg
Actually this makes no diff  cos if they wanna take ur car u can't do anything. That said  JB isn't the warzone the media makes it out to be lah,btohqsg
I call them elephants 🤭🤭🤭🤭 sorry if I offend anyone here,btohqsg
I say ask her to give herself some time to get used to it  dun set a time limit  learn to grow used with the car. Actually true la about the size  when you're used to small  suddenly big not used to it so would grumble  just like initially big  then become small also would find it hard to be satisfied,btohqsg
