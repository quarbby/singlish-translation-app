For medical...which counter is a better bet?,btohqsg
Short term  all medical stock is benefiting from Covid. Better bet is to find one that can unlock value in the long term but do be very cautious on medical stock as vaccine news and recovery will cause it stock price to correct in the long term. Funds is rotating out of medical into blue chips with recovery on the road.,btohqsg
