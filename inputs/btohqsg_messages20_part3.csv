Hi anyone know how to see the subscription rate for BTOs?,btohqsg
Are FEB 2024 BTOs still using the mature/non-mature categories or move on to the new standard/plus/prime categorisation??,btohqsg
HDB site isn't helpful at defining when exactly is 2H2024  as the new framework will be implemented then 🤷‍♀🤦‍♀,btohqsg
Isn't It from Aug 2024 bto onwards?,btohqsg
Is either u wait for the feb launch to get more details,btohqsg
Or wait for more details to come out,btohqsg
Dec 2023 sales launch out liao,btohqsg
second half means after June innit  since june is the half way month of the yearand after june means aug 2024 bto applications onwardsseems quite intuitive to me 🤔,btohqsg
how would one intuitively know 2H2024 means 2nd half of 2024? it's usually noted as Q3/Q4 2024 😒,btohqsg
as in  u didn’t know the H stands for half izzit,btohqsg
some articles that i read say second half haha not 2H eg mynicehomehdb says second half,btohqsg
So is the new scheme good or bad ?,btohqsg
I believe  is the project that matters,btohqsg
2H2024 is literally 2nd half of 2024.. it's their logic not ours lol 🤭,btohqsg
Anyway the project mention not out still 2nd half of 2024,btohqsg
New scheme lesser ppl apply ?,btohqsg
hmm new scheme lesser ppl eh... but some ppl will still prefer to bto 🧐,btohqsg
Mop 10 year for some is very long,btohqsg
nah. i asked coz if the new scheme starts for 2024 BTO (first one is in Feb)  i'll skip the current one and aim for that la,btohqsg
the first plus flat should be in superb location  maybe just right outside Bishan  Punggol  Jurong East or Tampines MRT?back then first plh river peak also very good,btohqsg
"hello we are students applying now on the portal. we have 2 questions1. under ""Deferred Assessment"" section  there's no option for currently on full time studies. there's only options for recently completed studies or NS. do we have to pick the completed studies option here?2. is the first timers priority automatically applied? under the ""Eligible Priority Schemes"" section it says not eligible for any priority schemes.",btohqsg
New scheme only start in Q2 2024. If follow the standard launch month  it will be in May 2024.,btohqsg
CuriousCan a 50yr old buy a resale 2 room flexi reaching mop ?,btohqsg
true. however 10Y MOP got more subsidy w their tighter restrictions. plus & prime— there are perks to it like better amenities  easier to commute to work.. at the end of the day  the choice is yours 🫢,btohqsg
hi guys  can i check  when will i know how many ballot chances that i will have?my kid currently is SC  but during HFE letter approval  she was stateless.do i need to request to update the HFE letter before applying BTO ?,btohqsg
Hi! May i know how can we qualify for FT(PMC) scheme? Do we need to change our marital status in the HFE letter as Married?,btohqsg
The woodlands new bto near woodland mrt won't be damm noisy?,btohqsg
Currently the Dec BTO and supposing Jan SBF is separated. Would we be considered second timer if we got better location and number during Jan's SBF launch and choose to give up Dec BTO?,btohqsg
Can I ask build time for Sinming is 32 months then how come TOP date for sinming 2027 June..??,btohqsg
it is computed from the median month of the flat selection period (median of march to dec 2024). assuming 32 months (2 years 8 months) from Aug 2024 (since aug is the midway point of march and dec)  that is April 2027. then hdb round to the nearest quarter  april and june is 2Q2027  so i guess they just round it later to june,btohqsg
do we need to apply for First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples) during application for bto ? on my screen only have MCPS but my kid still baby...,btohqsg
correct la.. if get ballot number  selection starts in 2024.. 32 mths is 2 years 8 mths..,btohqsg
I guess you have to wait until they update your application status after you have submitted.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Tanah Merah bto ended their selection already ?,btohqsg
Hi! I cant really rmb the exact details but (i was still a ft student during the application) during submission we submitted supporting documents like student certification letter/student status letter/ photo of student card as proof of student status,btohqsg
1. Has been answered by@murniayum  students are indeed part of DIA but not sure how it looks for HFE application now compared to HLE2. First timer priority is automatically applied yes,btohqsg
thanks very much both! I submitted the application since i think deferred income assessment not considered in the application anyways. will just inform hdb once we get to that stage 🤞,btohqsg
