Good luck for all balloted aug de,btohqsg
easier to get for Pasir Ris,btohqsg
to have 20% chance to get balloted  PR =#190 for 3rm  PR=#442 for 4rm  PR=#386 for 54m,btohqsg
I think pasir ris is the least popular isn't it,btohqsg
if you opt for 3rm confirm can get it since its below 1.0 for first timee,btohqsg

"Hi guys  want to check what is a ""airwell"" stated in the BTO site plan?",btohqsg
the air vent from the underground car park. Additional air for you to dry clothes lol.,btohqsg
Airwell is a non box up area..Allows light to penetrate and air to circulate..,btohqsg
Oh! So that is a airwell,btohqsg
Weirdly  I'm shock why there is a whole stretch of particular units not being selected for the tampines greencourt,btohqsg
It's beside a airwell and nothing else but not sure why that whole stretch of unit wasn't taken.. Any advice?,btohqsg
I don't mind  but what's holding everyone back  that's what I'm curious,btohqsg
eh if bought resale and ballot for BTO  need to pay levy right,btohqsg
