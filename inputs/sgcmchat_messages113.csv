Tell you. High ego ppl Liddat. They know they got nth in life to be happy abt,btohqsg
it's fine  he can doubt all he wants,btohqsg
my experiences with the car were more than enough to make up for his judgement  lack thereof.,btohqsg
he jealous that he cant get a car fr,btohqsg
pain in the ass to maintain  but a blast on the B roads up north.,btohqsg
that's why i ultimately let go of it,btohqsg
