So it makes sense you would think so,btohqsg
Wow Legolas is pretty cool !,btohqsg
Unless there is another mechanism than ACE2 mediated endocytosis,btohqsg
Thanks u 4 giving me chance KEKW,btohqsg
Then the people who recovered from the virus leh?,btohqsg
Immune system is a bit more complicated. Any case the news is likely false,btohqsg
Where did you have your lobotomy done,btohqsg
Yahoo has a large influx of fake news these days :/,btohqsg
the fact that ppl who recovered are testing positive again  suggests this as a potential possibility,btohqsg
How exactly? Does that link to this,btohqsg
the virus hides in the immune cells,btohqsg
I thought once you recover  your body has antibodies to fight against this?,btohqsg
plus so much time to read stuff now,btohqsg
So why THIS over the fact that sample size was so large that virus mutated.,btohqsg
Plus i havnt seen any recent updates in the genebank,btohqsg
Eh dudes the NSF concession pass is cheaper than adult or same price ah,btohqsg
wait sorry I meant the card,btohqsg
feeling cute  shall ignore this msg,btohqsg
If u not taking enough to make concession worth it it's same price as adult care right,btohqsg
but if u like travel 5-7 times a day,btohqsg
It's useful if you're in Transcom,btohqsg
Wait they don't tap out what,btohqsg
Maybe someone will say. Covid 19 affects braincells,btohqsg
Tharun has to go for checkup,btohqsg
I worked in a part time job which required me to travel on mrt/bus 5-7 times a day once,btohqsg
*me as a transcom occifer chasing criminal*Sorry sir give me space i need to tap out with my concession card to chase,btohqsg
And reached a new level of blur,btohqsg
Go like my new ig post,btohqsg
Let me follow John Smith’s insta,btohqsg
You just have to find it,btohqsg
That is where i have hidden my treasure,btohqsg
Everything I like is not on netflax and everything I don’t like is on netflax,btohqsg
Apparently they don’t have inglourious basterds and pulp fiction and princess bride,btohqsg
They have a lot of shit,btohqsg
But if u wan some shit that is abailable in US,btohqsg
U have to use certain VPN,btohqsg
Southpark u can watch online for free until current season tho,btohqsg
Rick and Morty is filling up my futurama void,btohqsg
What r u even watching rn,btohqsg
This one is a must watch,btohqsg
Is it less or more sexual,btohqsg
I can watch it on the tv,btohqsg
TV is in the living room,btohqsg
I am catching up on all the popular shows,btohqsg
Btw have you watched any Netflix show on TV yet?,btohqsg
I’ve been watching all my Netflix on tv,btohqsg
I've been watching The Witcher on TV while my family is at home,btohqsg
When I first have Netflix capability on TV I was excited  then I was quickly disappointed,btohqsg
1. The high number of random sex scenes that do not even add to the story2. It is only after trying to watch on TV that I realise I rely on the subtitles so much. (And reading subtitles is easier through mobile device than TV),btohqsg
Any one got phy notes For1. Waves2. Deformation of solids3. SuperpositionAnd chemistry1. Equilibria2. Reaction kinetics3. Chemical bonding,btohqsg
i only have 2 page notes summary all a lvl organic chem reagents and conditions though,btohqsg
Isnt this under copyright claim law,btohqsg
If tuition centre materials get leaked,btohqsg
Why do you have physucks notes,btohqsg
Only can see upload notes but I can’t seem to find notes,btohqsg
OVER 100 HOURS PLANTEDin last week'sStudy with Me  Plant a Tree! The response has been incredible and we want to thank each and every one of you amazing gardeners who made this thing possible :)Missed the livestream and muggathon this time? Don't worry - there's more coming your way soon. STAY TUNED!,btohqsg
The GIF speed abit too fast at times tbh,btohqsg
I swear I'm lost for words  this might be r/brandnewsentence material,btohqsg
Someone needs to work on their speed reading it seems,btohqsg
The level of jumping through hoops,btohqsg
Can someone just tell me why not 1+1 implies e^x is always positive,btohqsg
">>> if (1+1):...     print(""1+1 is truthy"")... else:...     print(""1+1 is falsey"")...1+1 is truthy",btohqsg
1+1=2 is a statement1+1 is not a statement,btohqsg
But how do we state 0 or 1,btohqsg
Is 1+1 equivalent to stating 1+1 exists?,btohqsg
A statement is something that is either true or false,btohqsg
Why do you reject fuzzy logic,btohqsg
What does fuzzy logic done to you,btohqsg
I shall leave this to the logicians,btohqsg
Why not binary pi and e,btohqsg
cause binaries are made up of 0s and 1s only,btohqsg
This is biased and I am offended,btohqsg
its the computer language that enables computers to transmit data from one point to another,btohqsg
Oh really? I thought it was the emission of electromagnetic waves that enable computers to transmit data from one point to another,btohqsg
thats the electrical wiring but data is in binaries,btohqsg
It was released slightly earlier on MOH,btohqsg
I think I’m getting desensitised to 3 digit numbers,btohqsg
Those days when 2 digit increase was the norm,btohqsg
I still find the news uplifting,btohqsg
Its the 21 cases we shld be worried,btohqsg
soon u will be desensitised to 4 digit numbers,btohqsg
I thought it was the transistors with a specified 'High' and 'Low' state ...,btohqsg
us at more than half a milk,btohqsg
haha its not scam cause u need electrical/electronics wirings such as pcbs n all,btohqsg
When donkin diagram meets his match,btohqsg
without those  data unable to transmit,btohqsg
You should be crawling this group 24/7,btohqsg
In order to ensure this doesn’t happen again,btohqsg
If it plummets a lot 2 weeks ltr,btohqsg
i would be surprised if the number is 6969,btohqsg
Eh actl what's the song ah,btohqsg
Who said I was sleeping?( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),btohqsg
guys i have a big brain question,btohqsg
I WANNA JOIN BUT I CAN'T@flipthebucket,btohqsg
you know we use “ya” alot  where does it come from,btohqsg
cause the yankies dont use it in the same context,btohqsg
and ya sounds like “ja” which means yes in german and norwegian,btohqsg
wait till we reach 3000 mark,btohqsg
didnt we reach 2000 a few days ago only,btohqsg
Message from Chonky deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
is it a coincidence or did we pick up ya from europe,btohqsg
cause yankies use ya like “ what are ya doing”,btohqsg
I just watched a Minecraft video with sideways gravity and my brain like,btohqsg
Now sees the actual world sideways,btohqsg
means i get paid for free doing nth at all,btohqsg
But difference is you get paid $2000 per month  I get recruit pay,btohqsg
Why do you have the mp3 of it,btohqsg
Difference is you get more pay than I do as an LCP before the increase,btohqsg
Of which $20 is gone for the now useless HomeTeam NS membership,btohqsg
Cornavirus: Record 386 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore; 65-year-old Singaporean man becomes 9th person to die from virushttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cornavirus-record-386-new-covid-19-cases-in-spore-65-year-old-singaporean-man-becomes-9th?xtor=CS3-18&utm_source=STiPhone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-04-13%2023%3A04%3A01,btohqsg
True  but promotion for us is easier,btohqsg
guys what if martial law happens,btohqsg
we about to reach 3k followers on the covid account,btohqsg
Even USA haven't reach martial law  I doubt we will,btohqsg
holy shit i’m just listening to the donki song,btohqsg
if everyone is infected our infection rate will be 0,btohqsg
Isn't that what some countries are doing,btohqsg
cant get increase in cases if everyone is a case,btohqsg
But in case martial law happens  does SPF have any power?,btohqsg
Basically we don't need to go SCS for sergeant,btohqsg
SPF technically isn’t military I guess,btohqsg
can’t get covid if you are already deceased,btohqsg
I don't get why you're saying this,btohqsg
Originally you say you get $2k less than someone,btohqsg
Police probably still had the general powers,btohqsg
But the saf will probably be the ones doing the patrol,btohqsg
Confusing then  he gets paid more than me cuz he's civilian,btohqsg
MP will need prepare DB for people who get arrested,btohqsg
you know what they do in philippines to get people to abide with the lockdown,btohqsg
they unleash ghosts into the streets,btohqsg
I wonder if there’s enough DB space for the whole SG,btohqsg
so we should open hell’s gate earlier this year,btohqsg
damn the mafia not be playin man,btohqsg
The Italian mafia helping out more than Trump's administration,btohqsg
I get to recover from my surgery at home  so no need to OOC,btohqsg
Someone seems to be enjoying their netflix,btohqsg
Local unlinked cases still will be monitored,btohqsg
And is expected to rise before going down,btohqsg
Help la  O-level question anyhowly state area.,btohqsg
The area of the triangle is definitely not 27 cm^2 or whatever given the measurements as provided,btohqsg
Pls fact-check O-level questions with me,btohqsg
That O-level math is also a scam,btohqsg
I bet $100 that it either extends or doesn’t,btohqsg
I bet your money that 27 is not equal to 36.4927496224.,btohqsg
I bet the same amount but twice that you are right,btohqsg
There's a third choice  Singapore fucking explodes,btohqsg
I have the n word pass from my black friend,btohqsg
In that case the CB doesn’t extend,btohqsg
That would mean the Govt is no longer in power,btohqsg
And if the Govt is not in power  CB is no longer in effect,btohqsg
So it’s not extended  and it also doesn’t end on time,btohqsg
How tf do yall even spend ur time,btohqsg
Wtf i have absolutely nth to do,btohqsg
I wake up at 6 then do nothing,btohqsg
Then during HBL i do nothing,btohqsg
Why you wake up at 6 lmfao,btohqsg
Cb finished his homework last week,btohqsg
What do you do in Meinkraft,btohqsg
I cant sleep its waking 2 hrs later,btohqsg
Not as fun as it sounds,btohqsg
I just stare at blank walls,btohqsg
Yo what netflix show is good,btohqsg
I'm still noob trying to build an ender portal,btohqsg
I shone my boots until i can see my face,btohqsg
lol I never bothered with ender stuff,btohqsg
Bro...do you need to get sleeping pills ?,btohqsg
Preferably teen related?smth like euphoria or 13rw,btohqsg
Likely not i just need smth better,btohqsg
It’s about a woman who gets into heaven but doesn’t deserve to be there,btohqsg
Ooo alright  i'll chrck it out,btohqsg
Im 90% sure its a Hentai,btohqsg
They call me hentai master for a reason,btohqsg
Theres Hentai euphoria and hbo euphoria,btohqsg
I forgot the full name but it was good shit,btohqsg
Any good hentai is good shit,btohqsg
I think I’ll finish what I’ve started first,btohqsg
Oh  I watched Mean Girls this afternoon,btohqsg
Can't be Lucifer if no Signature move Morning Star,btohqsg
Take the expectation of all girls.,btohqsg
It’s a movie about a group of female bullies,btohqsg
His crossover in Crisis of Infinite Earths was surprising,btohqsg
You need an appropriate sample space  event space and a mapping of events to between 0 and 1.,btohqsg
It’s kind of like 177013  except it’s way more positive,btohqsg
sorry bro but wht tf is 177013,btohqsg
U mean you can name all those hentais but you don’t know what 6 digit code represents,btohqsg
Uhh  let’s just say you can Google it,btohqsg
Now that I have revealed my power level  I shall tone it back down,btohqsg
thanks man i will read the manga,btohqsg
U fucking nerd will like it,btohqsg
I think by that time u would have to put some more coins in the machine,btohqsg
I watch from 8 to 8,btohqsg
Cause I have nothing else to do,btohqsg
One month is not nearly enough time for One Piece,btohqsg
oh i remember this scene HAHA,btohqsg
FGO is not animu so it’s ok,btohqsg
Plus disabled nsf dont have much activities either,btohqsg
Yeah ik HAHA as in i saw it on utube bfr xd,btohqsg
21 years and still not ending,btohqsg
Coz my dp no one can see,btohqsg
I can spend 1 hr contemplating,btohqsg
It’ll take a while more to see the effects of the c b,btohqsg
But if it extends no surprise,btohqsg
Not much you can do about that sadly,btohqsg
But it'll get harder for them to go out without a mask anyway,btohqsg
Other than these places I guess there are still parks,btohqsg
But if you're going to exercise wearing masks doesn't make sense anyway,btohqsg
The cotton masks are already hard to breathe in LOL,btohqsg
Would it be attributed as a covid death then,btohqsg
Leadership and job shadowing more impt,btohqsg
H3 is just a fluff bonus point,btohqsg
What H3 can you take that will be relevant to medicine,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I thought too,btohqsg
Compare that H3 you have in mind to a job shadowing/internship at a hospital,btohqsg
If you were the interviewer  which one would you prefer,btohqsg
ofc if you have both then good la,btohqsg
But I think it's pretty clear that medicine related experiences > volunteering > others,btohqsg
I didn't even take chem in JC LOL,btohqsg
If you J1 I'd suggest you focus on other stuff,btohqsg
I think CCA leadership achievements will be useful as well and activities outside school which highlight positive qualities (resilience  heart of service  etc.),btohqsg
have a decent cca portfolio  can le. Job attachments is important but if you don't have it  is fine also tbh,btohqsg
how are the interviews like? there r a few rounds rite,btohqsg
tbh the first/second choice bonus points thingy doesn't help much,btohqsg
Haha yeah don't listen to me too much I can't give advice,btohqsg
like u put medicine first choice u get bonus 2.5 pts,btohqsg
that one doesnt rly help much one,btohqsg
cos if everyone score roughly the same raw UAS range and put med first choice  at the end of the day they will still look at the raw score,btohqsg
The bonus points aren’t available for interview courses anyway,btohqsg
but even so  comp sci is a good example of how it doesn't help,btohqsg
depends on the schntu has one interview consisting of 8 stationsnus has two interviews consisting of a written test (sjt) and a group task (fsa)of course for this year the interviews are modified  prob will not be for next yr onwards,btohqsg
my seniors said it was ?,btohqsg
although i cant comment more abt it  but ya it isn't a group task/interview  even though theres a certain part that is grp interview,btohqsg
the remaining portions are individual stations,btohqsg
Genuine qn  but if there's anyone here who has went to tuition for chem at a tuition centre for A levels chem  can pm me? Thx wanna ask something.,btohqsg
Guys anyone going np ba this year?,btohqsg
I mean...If you have a sugar daddy or someone who what to share with you yes but if not no lah haha,btohqsg
Maybe if you're 21 and you're also a teen,btohqsg
That sweet $600 is in  bois,btohqsg
The only limit is your imagination,btohqsg
tfw when you born in sg and 21 but don’t qualify for $600,btohqsg
born in sg but seems like malaysia declared sovereignty over sg for a couple of seconds when i was born so i became malaysian,btohqsg
Oh I think I know how  if you’re born on leap day :),btohqsg
gotta wait till 28th april though,btohqsg
get them to share with you the 300,btohqsg
i didn't declare bank account i think,btohqsg
I thought they had it alr since they gave us the NS pay through the bank acc,btohqsg
then turns out need to fill in form,btohqsg
Being young is costing us money,btohqsg
so he turns 21 later this yr,btohqsg
Less frequent mrt = more commuters per given time waiting and congregating for train,btohqsg
As mentioned by an NCID doctor,btohqsg
I believe in my fellow singaporeans,btohqsg
Let the keyboard warriors within awaken,btohqsg
We still have morons like these,btohqsg
If extend im really fked uk,btohqsg
If they use community spread numbers as a benchmark  then confirm wont extend,btohqsg
If they see it as an overall of daily infections  will extend.,btohqsg
No sensible gov will do that,btohqsg
But however cos of this  it will prob extend,btohqsg
This one has to be qualitative > quantitative,btohqsg
Which goes back to the government,btohqsg
They have to make back the money they lost,btohqsg
And the Govt’s money is the citizen’s money,btohqsg
Wait didnt they just give out 600,btohqsg
Cause most of us are not 21,btohqsg
This group is full of ppl,btohqsg
i dont get how sugar daddies are supposed to be hot  a  common reason they are sugar daddies in the first place is cuz they cannot find someone who would accept them without money  be it cuz of their looks or their social skills,btohqsg
but money makes the world round 🤑🤑,btohqsg
I wish the non creepy ones would look for me but I guess that out of my league 😢,btohqsg
Looks like degenerate mode has been turned on,btohqsg
plus we’re always joking abt it la lol,btohqsg
being a stripper and accompanying sugar daddies is good moolah,btohqsg
Or maybe there’s no such thing as a sugar daddy who isn’t a degenerate,btohqsg
also most sugar daddies is like,btohqsg
Yeah but think of the degree,btohqsg
actually quite alot no touch de,btohqsg
I have a PhD in degeneracy,btohqsg
I READ AND LAUGHED OUT LOUD,btohqsg
i need a PhD in degeneracy,btohqsg
There are even funnier ones out there,btohqsg
At least you don’t like toes,btohqsg
my toe has been swollen for weeks,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionget me and the doctor a PhD in degeneracy too,btohqsg
To get chosen for degeneracy grad school,btohqsg
John smith says its a selective process,btohqsg
You have to submit a portfolio of your degeneracy,btohqsg
