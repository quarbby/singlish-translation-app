Sorry for the late night text but i am really helpless and lonely so i can only think of seeking opinions from this groupchat  hello i am currently 17 and was a student from jurong west secondary who took secondary 4 express in 2023 (last year) and took o levels. I failed some subjects so i decided to retake my o levels as private candidate and i did well this year HOWEVER i am missing either science or computing to pass to get into a good poly I did not apply for any of those subject exams for this year O levels so im thinking if i can apply for another year of O level as a private candidate for the SECOND time meaning i will be 18 next year  in order to get that one subject to go into a good polytechnic or jc. Also really confused if i retake as Private again for... 2nd time will i have to go for NS as i will be 18 NEXT YEAR. PLEASE HELP I AM REALLY SCARED OF MY LIFE PLS PLS,btohqsg
did u pass maths last year,btohqsg
If i am able to retake as private candidate again next year for 2025 can i still use my o level grades from 2024 and 2023? And will i need to attend NS if i take as private candidate?,btohqsg
