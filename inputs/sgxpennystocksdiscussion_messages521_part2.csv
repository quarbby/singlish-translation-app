Soros Warns Against Buying Into Rebound: What to Watch in China2021-08-31 00:24:24.499 GMTBy Richard Frost(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire George Soros has a blunt warningfor investors tempted to bargain hunt in beaten-down Chineseshares: don’t do it.While China has faced numerous difficulties in the past andalways comes through it  Xi Jinping’s increasing strangleholdover private enterprise means this time is different  Soroswrote in a column published in the Financial Times Tuesday  atleast his second op-ed on China this month. “Investors buyinginto the rally are facing a rude awakening.”Xi “is putting in place an updated version of Mao Zedong’sparty ” Soros wrote. “No investor has any experience of thatChina because there were no stock markets in Mao’s time.”(China’s equity market reopened in 1990 after being closed 40years earlier following the Communist revolution.)Buying the dip in Chinese stocks has been a tricky strategysince February  with no rebound lasting long enough for the HangSeng China Enterprises Index to rise more than 7.5% from troughto peak. The gauge  which tracks 50 Chinese companies listed inHong Kong  is this year’s worst performer among 92 benchmarkstracked by Bloomberg  down 16%. Sentiment remains so fragilethat its stocks are trading at less than book value on a weeklybasis  the lowest multiple since early 2016.Soros called for U.S. Congress to pass a bill that wouldforce asset managers to only invest in companies withtransparent governance structures that are aligned withshareholders. This would limit passive flows into Chinese stocksvia benchmark indexes because  according to Soros  “power andaccountability is now exercised by one man who is notaccountable to any international authority.”“If Congress were to enact these measures  it would givethe Securities and Exchange Commission the tools it needs toprotect American investors  including those who are unaware ofowning Chinese stocks and Chinese shell companies ” Soros wrote.Why China and U.S. Are Clashing Over Stock Listings:QuickTakeWhile Soros has long been vocal about China  describinghimself an outspoken opponent of what he calls a totalitarianregime under Xi  that hadn’t stopped his firm from investing inthe country’s shares.Soros Fund Management snapped up Chinese shares sold off inmassive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang’s ArchegosCapital Management  before exiting the positions earlier thismonth. The family office sold $194.3 million of ViacomCBS  $77million of Baidu shares and $46.4 million of stock in Vipshop according to a regulatory filing. Soros Fund Management alsoliquidated positions in Tencent Music Entertainment.Soros is best known for his large bets against currencies including a position shorting the British pound which made hishedge fund $1 billion in the 1990s. He also profited bettingagainst the Thai baht during the Asian financial crisis  andmore recently against the Japanese yen in 2012 and 2013.To contact the reporter on this story:Richard Frost in Hong Kong atrfrost4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Michael Patterson atmpatterson10@bloomberg.netSofia Horta e CostaTo view this story in Bloomberg click here:https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QYOEDUDWX2PSThanks & Regards Mabel ChowVice PresidentCentral ExecutionCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd(Co.
