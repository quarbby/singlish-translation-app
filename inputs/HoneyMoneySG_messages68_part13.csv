Oh alright  I guess you referred to both online and offline sits. Thanks TC,btohqsg
Hello everyone   does anybody have recommendations for good cash back credit cards ?,btohqsg
depends what u spend on and how much,btohqsg
I have 1 major upcoming item for spending. Usually I don’t spend a lot   mostly on groceries   eating out and occasionally taking grab/taxis,btohqsg
On some other site they stated thisDo note the following exclusions  in particular DFI vouchers (e.g. Cold Storage vouchers). DBS/yuu presumably has access tolevel 3 data which means they know exactly what you’re buying at yuu merchants.,btohqsg
Can DBS and citibank point converted to air asia miles?,btohqsg
Can I withdraw money from poems while waiting for the 5.8% interest to be credited in? Want to move them to moomoo. Any minimal withdraw amount?,btohqsg
If sign up crmc through singsaver still eligible for citi's welcome offer?,btohqsg
this is stated in the TnC but in practice ppl have been getting the yuu points,btohqsg
Wow buy voucher at the cold storage or via online,btohqsg
No minimum. I deposited 31 August and withdrew everything yesterday morning before 10am. Now waiting cheque to clear today 230pm to move to moomoo too.,btohqsg
So u redeem at counter when payment,btohqsg
talking about using yuu card at cold storage/giant to buy DFI vouchers,btohqsg
I use my CRMC for all online and Amaze for in person spending. Log on to citibank app frequently to check your rewards earned for the month. Only $1000 online spend will get the 10× points.,btohqsg
But not eligible for flights and hotel if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Hello all  can anyone confirm how UOB Lady counts $5 block?Does every transaction have to be at least $5 or it's the total of all spending in the statement then given in $5 block (eg. Statement total is $996  I will only get $995 worth of miles)Thank you,btohqsg
Yes. Correct.  Also $1000 spending is quite low,btohqsg
idk about uob. But for dbs  they said its points based on blocks for $5 spend. So if you only spend 4.99 in a transaction   no points. Correct me if I'm wrong  this is my understanding.,btohqsg
only the 1x points need $5 blocks per transaction. 9x and 5x bonus points are calculated on accumulated spending  in the month,btohqsg
So technically still need mininum $5 per transaction for points,btohqsg
Any reason why you use cheque and not bank transfer for withdrawal?,btohqsg
SCB esaver how to get the emailer promo 3.6%?,btohqsg
no need bother too much just for the 1x point (0.4mpd),btohqsg
It's is the posb website  under the cc  look under spc. Basically physical card gives instant rebate. Virtual will take longer.,btohqsg
May i ask. Fixed deposit vs ssb. Which is better option? Thanks,btohqsg
By invite only. Probably to people who have shifted large amounts of liquidity in and out before,btohqsg
Hi can i check for uob solitaire - transport category..If i use it for simplygo  how does the per $5 miles award works? Does it work by transaction or by the monthly bill?,btohqsg
Thanks. I emptied my SCB accounts due to FD all matured. Not sure why my RM open Wealth Saver for me  so I don't have eSaver  just opened eSaver yesterday.,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if interest will be pro rated if i created uob one account mid month and deposit 100k in it?,btohqsg
i think base x1 reward will be base on trasaction amountbonus reward will base on monthly amount,btohqsg
Did you get upgraded to priority?,btohqsg
Priority since January  although empty everything  SCB still retain my priority so sweet,btohqsg
Yeah I heard it’s the same for OCBC and UOB. Don’t need to maintain to continue holding the status.,btohqsg
Did something happen to moomoo? Things all failed to load even website down,btohqsg
No problems on my endEdit: ok some things failing to load,btohqsg
No reply from Moomoo's WhatsApp since last week,btohqsg
Is there a high interest account out there that doesn't need salary credit? I'm already using UOB stash account so I cannot use it again unless I make a joint account,btohqsg

Thanks. Was overseas so didn't call them.,btohqsg
Can DBS and citibank point converted to air asia miles?,btohqsg
DBS  need a minimum amount before can convert to air miles. Citibank  blocks of 25000 points to 10000 miles. Citibank more flexibility in choosing the miles partner and can keep points in Citibank for 3 years before expiry,btohqsg
If I buy unit trust for ocbc account 360 for extra 1.5%  do I need to keep the UT for 12 months?,btohqsg
