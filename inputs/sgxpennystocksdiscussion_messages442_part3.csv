The worst supply chain disruption in history - this is why we should continue to bet on the inflation theme and the commodity supercycle . Don‚Äôt trust Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen   this inflation cycle is not transitory .Severe bottlenecks that have snarled major ports in the U.S. and Europe through the pandemic are now disrupting operations at a key export hub in China that could last until the end of this month and lead to further rise in ocean freight rates.Yantian International Container Terminals  an operator of terminals at Shenzhen port  was partially closed late last month for a few days after some dockworkers were among those confirmed with Covid amid an outbreak in Guangdong Province. The facility is facing challenges due to efforts by the local authorities to disinfect and enforce quarantine measures that have led to labor shortages.The disruption at the world‚Äôs fourth-busiest container port is putting stress on an already fragile global supply chainSource BloombergCredits to Robin Hohttps://www.facebook.com/groups/rhotradingcommunity/permalink/1549895122009250/#HPHTrust#Samudera#Inflationisheretostay,btohqsg
