Hi  can I ask if anyone tested Freed eHEV and sienta?Is the car floor raised and causing discomfort to the 2nd row passenger? (Lifted knees),btohqsg
Think most used car dealers selling good price now. Not sure,btohqsg

Sienta 2nd row is more comfortable than Freed,btohqsg
Latest gen Freed surpasses gen 3 Sienta,btohqsg
Latest gen Freed comes in 2 configurations,btohqsg
Gen 3 Sienta is a hassle to raise the last row seats cos it's hidden under the 2nd row,btohqsg
Which gives u more space when u do not need them. Pretty awesome design ah.,btohqsg
