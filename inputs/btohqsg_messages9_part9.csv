that's if the loan is enough to cover,btohqsg
4r  example $500k  then you must have $50k fund either CPFOA or cash for downpayment  then another 4 or 5 years to save up,btohqsg
Just have to pay levy üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
But the levy is paid to government himself or will the levy be paid into our new house ?,btohqsg
then say if your loan quantum is $350k  then you must cough up at least $100k during key collection  oh and levy $40k  in cash too,btohqsg
pay HDB in cash I think,btohqsg
and there's a cap of how much proceeds you can use from the sale of your resale,btohqsg
Loan quantum for the new flat or my current one ?,btohqsg
you not eligible for loan with HDB 2nd time right,btohqsg
Levy how they count ah ? Half of what i earned or ?,btohqsg
HDB loan can only apply once?,btohqsg
that's why you have to find out more on the contra,btohqsg
how old is your resale flat,btohqsg
My current flat is bto flat not resale,btohqsg
then $40k for 4r if you're applying for 4r,btohqsg
just remember you can't use the sale proceeds of your resale fully for your next purchase,btohqsg
50% of sales proceed I think,btohqsg
As I currently hold on to a flat,btohqsg
Then the rest of the 50% is see whether can loan till the amount or not ?,btohqsg
Now currently interest rate from HDN is 3.16%,btohqsg
Cause my wife borrowed HDB Loan before,btohqsg
Till i sell the current house then revert back to 2.6%,btohqsg
50% cash proceeds is pay to our new flat right,btohqsg
So levy and 50% cash proceeds is different,btohqsg
Yup levy and cash proceed doff,btohqsg
So lets say i earn 100k from selling my current flat   i have to pay 30k levy + put 50% cash proceed to my new flat?,btohqsg
I did not take grants from current house,btohqsg
Minus off the outstanding and all other fees and that consider cash proceeds,btohqsg
I think for your current hse -> new BTO  if you lucky can arrange to sell within the key collection period as you have 3 months time to move out.So sell house before BTO key -> money into cpf -> pay BTO collect key -> take some time to move.But danger is if BTO side delay very troublesome. Also can look for sellers willing to wait longer until you ready to move out as well üôÇBottom line is plan properly and DYODD!,btohqsg
please factor in the reno for the new house too,btohqsg
For me as long no need to lose too much as mine is 7 years later,btohqsg
By then current house sure drop in values,btohqsg
what's the best time to sell the flat,btohqsg
still need to ask for extension of stay from the new owners,btohqsg
otherwise  how to gao dim your accomodation after selling the flat,btohqsg
Will look into this in 2027 and discuss with agent,btohqsg
like that ah then would you consider selling your house now and rent a room to stay for 7 years? rental*84 months,btohqsg
Current house only use CPF to pay,btohqsg
then LL to earn lesser from the sale,btohqsg
As my parents room still need to tidy up,btohqsg
but unclean air maybe not now due to covid but after that.....,btohqsg
I heard it can get overwhelming. But it is from time to time.,btohqsg
soli ah means you get a temp loan from HDB at 3.16% interest till the resale house is sold right? means upon key collection you can have two houses at the same time but on the expense of 0.56% extra interest paid to HDB,btohqsg
Yup so best sold the house before key collection 3 months before that the idea,btohqsg
I don't know since I am staying quite far from pasir gudang though I have witnessed the burning of chimney at my service yard 13 years ago,btohqsg
that's if the new owners do not mind letting you stay for 3 months,btohqsg
and how would you anticipate the key collection date???,btohqsg
say you change your key collections to a month later from the given date and you engage an agent to help you sell but they take an average of 2 months to deal ....hmmm,btohqsg
plus reno takes 2 months average,btohqsg
I can rent house for a few months ba üò¨  thank you !! I will save it all üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
