Yes. Should have stopped from 2-3 days ago 🙂,btohqsg
Cos they use the posting date?,btohqsg
Anyone sign up big saving payout in Jun? Has your fund earmark?,btohqsg
Limited choice.. paywave can't be used. Only can use Kris Pay and Fave pay.,btohqsg
Lazada and shopee maybe can.. need to double check,btohqsg
Oh no.. so seems like different name via fast with SAL not working ? Anyone else have this issue ?,btohqsg
Probably won't work already. Corporate GIRO only. Use another bank account.,btohqsg
In memoriam of one of the best cards existed. RIP,btohqsg
Dramatic Sia  imho the nerf isn’t even that bad given that now so many things can be done/purchased online. Is only dining that are more affected if you break it down,btohqsg
Different opinion I guess. HSBC Revo used to be my main card until early this year. It was good intro to mile games for me.,btohqsg
hsbc revo well and alive for me. still many uses,btohqsg
Yea I still don’t think it’s a card that needs to be cancelled given the zero AF,btohqsg
Im cancelling in the hope that I regain New to Bank status and HSBC releases a new product even superior (very slim chance I'm aware),btohqsg
Their sub is better than keeping HSBC revo. 😆,btohqsg
Then you need to make sure you redeem all your points first. I don’t think there will ever be a card remotely close to revo. Seeing that they focused on t1 and now live+. Seems like they are segregating between cashback and miles card,btohqsg
Im hoping this card is still as juiced as it is now one year down the road (again I doubt it),btohqsg
now is 8%   next year is 5%Get up to 8% cashback as follows:a. 5% cashback will be awarded to eligible cardholders on eligible purchases made with dining  shopping and entertainment and / or petrol merchantsb. An additional 3% cashback will be awarded to eligible cardholders on eligible purchases made with dining  shopping and / or entertainment merchants from 21 June 2024 to 31 December 2024This is subject to meeting the minimum spend of SGD600 in eligible purchases per month  for all 3 months in any calendar quarter.,btohqsg
Ngl your constant name changing confused me@AdrainHoa,btohqsg
Need of luck... betting last 2 weeks get some $$.. to cover annual fee amex,btohqsg
Last night if draw.. the whole 200 gone,btohqsg
If I use my HSBC EGA to giro to my IBKR (monthly basis)  will i be an eligible for the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
how do you even GIRO to IBKR,btohqsg
Oh I meant if I set it up as recurring basis,btohqsg
Hi Cw  this is Khaled from the Dobin team. To track your credit card information (balances  spend  rewards)  connecting to bank accounts is needed. Dobin also has other features that don't require connecting bank accounts like MCC search  Best Card for Next Purchase  and Upsized Discounts,btohqsg
If link hsbc revolution with shopback and pay via shopback pay  will that be considered online payment? 🤔,btohqsg
Is DBS WWMC very close to Revo? Other than its 1 year expiry…How about UOB PPV?,btohqsg
good news to Iphone users 🙆‍♀️😋,btohqsg
And the code is for visa card. 😅 thats why not eligible.,btohqsg
but i have use it before. no issue. now this is my 2nd tries,btohqsg

Hi gurus for 6k payment for lessons  any card to sign up to make use of this payment?,btohqsg
Cashback won't it be same as like uob evo or uob1 card?,btohqsg
Sorry I am abit noob when it comes to cashback,btohqsg
If uob now offers 300 cashback based on required amount spent does that mean uob is better for cashback now?,btohqsg
Education not covered by many. Which school ?,btohqsg
Today is the day where we can stop using HSBC Revo for ApplePay/Paywave,btohqsg
Cashback is an even easier concept. Buy stuff  pay bill  let the cashback offset your next bill,btohqsg
People should have stopped using contactless 2-3 days ago 😆,btohqsg
I will continue to use it for kris pay and kris shop,btohqsg
R u serious i put 10 000 only and not 10 001 so i was not eligible for the 2 bonus miles?,btohqsg
