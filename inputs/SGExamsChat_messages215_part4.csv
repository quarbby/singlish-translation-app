hii can anyone recommend which telco for home broad bane fiber is worth signing up for?,btohqsg
I use M1 broadband for good balance of price vs speed. Pure internet. About $30/mth. 600 Mbps. If you're a gamer... there's MyRepublic. I don't use cable tv  so pairing with XXX free channels is redundant  like what Starhub and Singtel like to do. Also... do research for your area  for which has the most stable connection..for example  friends and students in Bukit Panjang commonly complain about connectivity or slow connections with the local red-logo company.,btohqsg
I tot 500Mbps? Most times maybe lower than that,btohqsg
If u just surf internet for news  check emails  occasionally watch YouTube or very little livestreaming  then get a sim card with a router. Maybe tpg,btohqsg
