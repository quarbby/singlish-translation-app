yes hospital mcc not excluded for citibank,btohqsg
I'm using it as my main savings acc rn. Pretty good so far  got my 2.5% interest earlier this month.,btohqsg
Yep same just tried grab banned,btohqsg
for hospital - usually for private hospitals it's counted for most cards.,btohqsg
Btw what is your net cash back ?For jb expense thx ü§î,btohqsg
not true. hospital mcc excluded on many cards,btohqsg
I'm surprised Citi cards didn't excluded health Care like doctor payment,btohqsg
Can we use amaze for contactless payment n simplygo?,btohqsg
Previously I'm using citi cashback +  1.6% Only recently decide to change to miles game,btohqsg
Ya 1.6 is pretty low I feel at least 3%,btohqsg
Need to read up the credit card T&C.,btohqsg
for no minimum spending and no limit. I think 1.6% is pretty good,btohqsg
Oh well ya better then nothing,btohqsg
Does Citi Rewards card have minimum spend?,btohqsg
Have anyone received their OCBC 360 interest?,btohqsg
for amaze+citi rewards  will the MCC be forwarded to citi rewards or any spend via amaze will work?,btohqsg
MCC will not change and will be charged to CRMC as such.,btohqsg
ahh ok thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Amaze is only changing the transaction type to ‚Äúonline‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say you go McDonald and use contactless. Amaze will convert ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù payment to ‚Äúonline‚Äù payment as though you ordered McDonald via their online app.McDonald‚Äôs MCC still need to be eligible.,btohqsg
Does anybody know if you can still use UOB absolute cashback paired with gpmc for cashback on cpf top ups?,btohqsg
for SC Smart Card  does anyone know when the additional 360 reward points are gonna be credited to the account? I read the TnC but cannot find any info about it,btohqsg
Check your statement it not automatic u need to redeem,btohqsg
Give it 2-3 days after the statement date..,btohqsg
Well said and explained. Effective 4% nett cashback when CitiRewards paired with Amaze card. Clearly superior to YouTrip IMO. Overseas cash withdrawal better with Revolut as there‚Äôs no charge for first $350 atm withdrawal üòÖ,btohqsg
No more points for Amaze card with UOB lady's card,btohqsg
"actually tapping Amaze for bus/mrt is not ""Amaze* Transit*""",btohqsg
Anyone facing issue where OCBC FAST transfer to other banks is only on the next day (and not immediate)?,btohqsg
How to make the FAST transfer immediate?,btohqsg
All along is immediately unless u keys in wring account or the bank got issues?,btohqsg
Some banks only will post it the follow day  but the transaction is dated to ur transfer rate.I use OCBC to pay my CC billsStandard Chartered and UOB reflect next day but datedIf u are referring to this,btohqsg
Guys  UOB One Account promotion has got 4-5 valid cards.Will I be eligible if $500 is split up between those eligible cards in a month ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right  if you are comparing within multi currency wallet  revolut is better for withdrawal. But revolut charge you 1% weekend fee.So I‚Äôll use youtrip for swipe card in JB and revolut for cash withdrawal.,btohqsg
I transfer RM back to Malaysia every month using Revolut. Previously I could do UOB Amex - Grab - Revolut and earn 1.7% on that monthly transaction. Now that Grab has nerfed that  the only choice I have is to use my other Visa/Master to top up Revolut directly since Revolut don't accept Amex. I'm resigned to not earning an 'extras' for doing my monthly RM Revolut transfer unless any one here got any else to recommend?,btohqsg
I have never remit money before. But I rmb seeing on YT people test using Maybank  CIMB and wise to remit money from SGD to RM.Can‚Äôt really earn extra  but you can find out which method has better rates.,btohqsg
Only amaze*transit  other mcc should work,btohqsg
good morning all  just joined. I'm going to buy a few big ticket items for new house  wondering which cash back cards can maximum opportunity for this. any one can share tips? thanks!,btohqsg
I guess it is really which merchant u plan to buy from and what mcc that merchant is,btohqsg
Hi  just checking if I have USD in dbs multiplier  how do I transfer out without incurring those remittance charges? Can I transfer to broker or e-wallet like youtrip/revolut?,btohqsg
Courts  Harvey  best  gain  ikea  you can use ocbc titanium. Can spend up to 13k a year for 4mpd.Other cards like uob ppc and hsbc revo also suitable but you need break up to $1k payment a month.,btohqsg
These are generally miles card though... Although I think they can convert the points into cash. Need double check.,btohqsg
Wtf why is there a delay in withdrawing my Syfe Wealth Assets? Who else received this?,btohqsg
If ordering online  Citi SMRT is nice 5% cash back,btohqsg
Yes. Thats my own acct ss,btohqsg
Wait for 1-2 business day and check again.,btohqsg
Thanks. It would be either online or mostly at merchants shops like Parisilk  Courts  etc using mobile payments,btohqsg
ok  thanks for sharing  I go google on the card,btohqsg
If u buying from court i recommend buying voucher from carousell for courts or capita voucher,btohqsg
thanks. let me go google... 5% cash card is awesome!,btohqsg
Parisilk then use the card recommend by other,btohqsg
5 percent is only for online purchase,btohqsg
