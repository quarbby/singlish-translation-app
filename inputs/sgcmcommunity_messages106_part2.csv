You can get the d|€kJust call me the ball s@ckI'm nuts,btohqsg
sorry for the late reply!! he gave up the idea le,btohqsg
he needs his car for work and can't just leave it there for 2 days,btohqsg
At the 2nd link there isn't any v power only v racing,btohqsg
Y not. A dollar Dave is a dollar earned.  Don't tell me you pump v racing all the time,btohqsg
I just went there last week,btohqsg
But i believe all of us will be smart enough to look around too if don’t want v racing,btohqsg
Easier for me.  So far Petronas no such problem. Petron I'll avoid if possible  I got muck at the station  sungai buloh.  Staff and management not helpful at all,btohqsg
And elaborate on your issues with petron and shell,btohqsg
No need to worry about v racing.,btohqsg
Wah finally entertainment in this chat after our most favourite member got kicked,btohqsg
guys my favourite sentence is incoming,btohqsg
Ok but if you just open your eyes a bit  can see the different coloured nozzles and see what to pump,btohqsg
You didn't speak about petron yet,btohqsg
"Getting ""muck"" on yourself can happen anywhere sir....",btohqsg
How dare you point out a good tip and make his life easier,btohqsg
How dare you imply he doesn't know all this,btohqsg
So you dislike petron because you gotmuckonce there,btohqsg
I guess if happen in your doorstep you will not help,btohqsg
How is that anyone else's fault,btohqsg
I guess I enjoyed getting mucked,btohqsg
Next time your car got dust? Will you avoid all roads in Singapore? Because LTA never wash the car for you?,btohqsg
Anyway my money  I decide what to pump,btohqsg
"""avoid shell  avoid petron"" they never clean my muck off my shoes  they never tell me I'm pumping more expensive petrol",btohqsg
Why not buy a car in JB so can pump 95 then transfer to your car,btohqsg
Hope the PETRONAS guys come and clean your shoes  feed you grapes and fill the right petrol in for you,btohqsg
Seems like that's what you want at a petrol station in a different country where you're availing the cheaper price anyway,btohqsg
Need korkor protect you while you pump petrol?,btohqsg
No need.  Hope you get it one day,btohqsg
Good luck go the area that I’ll getmuck,btohqsg
i wud go with u or serene or shane or the regulars here only,btohqsg
Save you from pumping Ron 100 or vpower racing,btohqsg
And make sure you pump 97 instead of 100,btohqsg
And then if your minimum grade 98  your engine start knocking,btohqsg
Mr Cross is cross with the staff at Petron as they didn't clean his shoes for him,btohqsg
but honestly bro  as long as u go malaysia  just pump the petrol u want. dc what brand what price or service. ultimately  don't forget the main goal u are there. to pump petrol.,btohqsg
Yup I just saying I will avoid shell solely becos of v racing,btohqsg
Scared of v racing is it,btohqsg
Or to drive and have fun,btohqsg
Petrol can be a byproduct on the way back!,btohqsg
97 Vs v racing price difference is just too much,btohqsg
All you have to do is,btohqsg
V powered racing is a bright red,btohqsg
If you cannot make the colour difference out,btohqsg
How do you differentiate between amber and red traffic lights sir?,btohqsg
Sir can I have your carplate,btohqsg
I would like to use it on my vehicle,btohqsg
I think you have free pass from LTA,btohqsg
aiya  v racing. after conversion still 1.71 per litre.. if its at 5.05RM.. still cheap. once in awhile pump wrong issokay,btohqsg
i wud take it as an opportunity to see which fuel grade is good,btohqsg
