test papers are harder than tys,btohqsg
thats why im doing them but my teacher say do tys,btohqsg
tys is for foundation  some qns that appear in tys will reapear in your national exam again,btohqsg
Test papers is to build up that foundation you made doing tys..the reason why teacher said to do tys is because your foundation to her/him is not solid enough to build on with test papers,btohqsg
maths standard same for prelim and tys for the last qn only,btohqsg
same for sci the last section the long ass writing ones,btohqsg
If you are not even scoring well doing Tys  no point doing test papers,btohqsg
You will just stress out yourself for no better reason,btohqsg

wow brotha english like me.. for me  i just spam comprehension  aim full marks for those  understand the answering technique  use exam papers to practice compreediting if you want  buy an assessment book and just keep practising..i know it sounds a lot but these are the only two ways to improve ur english grade to B3 since you don’t really have time to practise different writing styles for essay writing,btohqsg
compre and visual text ^^ vt must must full marks,btohqsg
alright will lurk in the subreddits thanks!,btohqsg

ok but im not in rp L,btohqsg
but I’m in media course js not sp 🫦🫦,btohqsg
at least im not stressing out in poly,btohqsg
anyways Cedric the qn u asked idk how to do I forgot alr,btohqsg
I’m in n levels dmad is the only design course that allow me to get grade 3 min,btohqsg
good luck still couldn’t be me,btohqsg
ok yeah prelims for n’s abit shaking rn,btohqsg
you’re always high  but you’re right,btohqsg
if I say prelims people auto think Os,btohqsg
i dont want to be debbiedowner but my cohort of 80+ students in n levels...only 6 went poly,btohqsg
28 went sec 5 including me..and the rest went ite,btohqsg
you can try your luck with poly eae..but you have to keep in mind  during pfp..the things you will learn is very simillar to sec 5,btohqsg
huh.. prelims n level is a such thing what how ik whether u n or o,btohqsg
ok ur one is abit 💀💀 mine mostly chose ite poly or else private,btohqsg
but ur Eng idk how to help honestly,btohqsg
my cohort of sec 5 was so big they nearly wanted to split it into 2 classes,btohqsg
cause moe stopping sec 5 soon alr,btohqsg
q a bit went private actually,btohqsg
why would you go into a route that moe is about to end,btohqsg
i know a few of my cohort that did that..some even went back to their country,btohqsg
why not?? the more I wld take sec 5 sec 5 is super good if you alr taking express subjects like math and science,btohqsg
i took both  and its because of science that most of my sec 5 class went to nursing..Like half of my sec 5 class went nursing in poly,btohqsg
idk about the relevancy of sec 5 in poly  that is the point im trying to make,btohqsg
it’s not how sec 5 is relevant in poly,btohqsg
we’re talking abt how you said why wld ppl take sec 5,btohqsg
its because of the relevancy thats why im saying..why would anybody want to go to sec 5,btohqsg
as an admin the kick button is always there for u,btohqsg
to me education is straight forward..thats why when yall start talking about stem- non stem subjects im like clueless af...y'all actually look into education  i dont,btohqsg
hi cedric do you have anymore questions,btohqsg
Alr guys new studying cycle coming into force,btohqsg
Exam period to 1 2 weeks after relax for a bit,btohqsg
Welp to me  i just dont look into it....that in depth  cause to me education is just going to school  do the best you can and zhao,btohqsg
thats why in poly im doing the same thing  finish up whatever i need...do whatever i need help whoever i need and end my day. I get D  C..B's. I just accept and improve,btohqsg
eh what works for you works for you,btohqsg
i try to improve everytime but eh,btohqsg
sometimes idk what to improve on,btohqsg
The other point im finding out very quickly however is how..rp has alot of resources  and have very lazy faci's,btohqsg
"Im also trying to find how to improve from classmates...But the reality is none of them are actually studying/putting in any effort and scoring A's. They are just copying from senior's answers in quizes  chatgpt all their class work. I feel like its ""cheating"" so ive tried to not use it but it has come to a point where there are classmates around me that are willing to help me ""cheat"" and i just accept their help",btohqsg
The problems of the Bell curve,btohqsg
yes  never seen a poly with such a effective bell curve,btohqsg
n then theres me who doesnt know if its bellcurve with my grades because so many people are saying the projects are difficult but the coding projects are the only times ive done super well,btohqsg
in my poly  around 60 people across 2-3 diplomas had their marks voided for graded assignment because of one pair of students that copied each other's work.Now the cohort after mine no longer has graded assignments for that module and it became a MSA/ESE module,btohqsg
altho its impossible to not copy for coding projects lol,btohqsg
yea indeed is  but both students did not even change anything...was a straightup 100% copy..then slowly the school unravelled and realise through word of mouth  around 60+ students were implicated,btohqsg
heyheyhey i if people dont see context ill be ripped to shreads HAHHA,btohqsg
no it’s ok sch deserve shade,btohqsg
then about? whatever i decide to post?,btohqsg
i dont understand which part of the statements i made about sec 5 was not common sense?,btohqsg
Uh bro actually right its kinda js express NA NT rebranded,btohqsg
Cause G3 subject certification will be equivalent to express G2 NA and G1 NT so all in all except for minus one year and no more cambridge its kinda the same thing,btohqsg
uh huh.. and then?? how does that change whether people continue going sec 5 or not,btohqsg
one of u give me full bloody context instead of just sending me 3 TEXT MESSAGES,btohqsg
its like expecting me to run a marathon without even learning to walk,btohqsg
or actually don’t need to know,btohqsg
i think its just these parts..,btohqsg
they still talking abt it not me bro,btohqsg
im done alr  in my head..Its just true fr,btohqsg
Debate over taking sec 5.@mallywellythinks that sec 5 is actually useful and then@Ryannnnnnnnnnthinks its useless and moe gon remove so why still wanna take,btohqsg
"not gonna continue the debate  but my ending pt is just that the fact that there is no start (not able to even see what pocoyo is saying ""idt this year alot"" to) means its not the full context  thats all",btohqsg
i think pocoyo is sane that’s all i have to say,btohqsg
aight  nvm someone explained it alr,btohqsg
cuz if im a outsider  idk if pocoyo is talking abt she dont think this year got alot of monkeys  potatoes  humans  sheep  cow,btohqsg
sums up my thoughts on rp,btohqsg
bro my classmate damn stupid sia,btohqsg
"hist cher ask us ""which sources support the statement""",btohqsg
"then she go and write ""sources b and d contradict each other""",btohqsg
Some ppl need 1 more year for learning yk,btohqsg
So if moe remove what gon happen to these ppl,btohqsg
then she go and bring up reliability HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
readup on moe statements  they got outline how they want it to be implemented,btohqsg
bruh my sch teacher told me that all you need to do to past elec is Aqf all the qns,btohqsg
you will get at least a lvl 2 2/3 marks6questions=6x3=1818 pass alr,btohqsg
"so js learning abt it then the question was ""The inmates in German Camps were mistreated. Do you agree?""",btohqsg
E: explain what this means and so what,btohqsg
No leh u gotta include both sides,btohqsg
so u have to write like two differing opinions and which source,btohqsg
"my hist showed my class a vid of the holocaust and one of my classmates can still ask ""Who did the german attack""?",btohqsg
then to set the foundation to answring cher ask this and then got this clownery,btohqsg
Tbh that's a tcher I want,btohqsg
bro we’re past that  new syllabus,btohqsg
fun story my mid terms ended this month and finals is end of next month,btohqsg
"but each ""exam"" is 10 weeks worth of content",btohqsg
"even btr is that one time we were learning abt LON treaties lah then question we were discussing was ""How did this have an impact on the League of Nations?""",btohqsg
but rly start early.. don’t push until exam period  the teacher lazy mark then give you sloppy work,btohqsg
Send half to tutor send half to eng tcher,btohqsg
but that also means u cannot give sloppy work ah,btohqsg
"yea pray dont have a teacher like mine..tell us do  submit schools hols come back ""sorry i did not mark"" and ""sorry i misplaced your papers""",btohqsg
not really  im getting B's alr,btohqsg
"she go and say ""why is the USA always getting involved in everything??"" cher ask back ""whats ur point""""The USA sucks"" was what she replied exactly word for word.",btohqsg
bro the only tutor i got is math,btohqsg
I have math and eng tuition only,btohqsg
Not my parents force me to,btohqsg
Bruh look at my grades...is this the grades of someone that should be stressing out?,btohqsg
No bc at that point he has other purpose in life,btohqsg
from a sec school kid yes,btohqsg
BLUD FR WENT FOR IT 😭,btohqsg
If academics cannot then go non academics,btohqsg
We still need blue collar workers,btohqsg
They are integral to our society and economy,btohqsg
If every smart liddat who do the mundane admin work,btohqsg
as a jc failure who knows how bad my grades are to someone who did relatively better in the grade distribution ASSUMING i was in polyyes,btohqsg
its done  3 of the graded alr submitted..left two exams,btohqsg
So cannot say you worthless bc your academics bad,btohqsg
my teacher sent me the answers and qns for the last 2 yrs of papers..so ill just copy and paste those qns and ans onto a notepad,btohqsg
"even my faci's told us that ""What makes you think this year's paper will be drastically different than your seniors  we faci's got no time to create new qns""..He is the one that set the paper as well",btohqsg
at least i did not cheat to get my B,btohqsg

my other dream pets are like axolotl,btohqsg
bearded dragon  snapping turtle  angler fish,btohqsg

i cannot imagine ng kok song or tkl coming to national day parade,btohqsg

instead of waving to the people he say this,btohqsg
nfs is what? need for speed?😁,btohqsg
so happy cuz he gnna sit there do nth and collect millions,btohqsg
nvm did not affect cpf..but he made some bad buisness decision that led ntuc to write off a substantial amount of money,btohqsg
not as insane as the coffee brand uncle,btohqsg
altho he seems a bit short circuit smt   but he ‘s like the better alternative,btohqsg
He became the chief in 1997  obviously must show some good face mah,btohqsg
cannot imagine ng kok song or tkl face on in front of the school hall or general office,btohqsg
what does tharman have: (he joined this useless organization),btohqsg
The thing is he started off as a general manager,btohqsg
i dont think as a general manager you could have so much power as to pivot a whole's company earnings,btohqsg
Tan only became Ceo in 1997,btohqsg
wait your Chem teacher was classmates with,btohqsg
tbh tan is not a independent candidate,btohqsg
nah he’s just a “bad” pap member,btohqsg
when he joined ntuc as a general manager in 1997  he joined the pap the previous year as branch secretary,btohqsg
this is the organization that tharman is associated with,btohqsg
idek if ng kok song is considered as independent candidate or not,btohqsg
vote for him if uw to feel happy while not owning anything,btohqsg
tbh  its tough because gic is a government entity,btohqsg
imagine he stand for president for revenge,btohqsg
I feel like he's like the neighbourhood tikopeh uncle.,btohqsg
I CANT SEE HIM AS PRESIDENT,btohqsg
IMAGINE SEEING HIM OR TKL DURING NDP,btohqsg
it just feels weird having him together with a wife that is almost as old as his children,btohqsg
TKL cannot la. This one joker.,btohqsg
not to mention to put up the photo and their wifes,btohqsg
I vaguely can see ng as our president,btohqsg
Can’t wait for 2029 election when Heng Swee Keat unleashes his Tampines plan,btohqsg
I thought there will only be good fight between GG and TS,btohqsg
imagine in school everyday morning assemble and u see kok song and sybil or tkl and wife,btohqsg
who is the speaker of house now ah,btohqsg
somebody else cannot rmb name alr,btohqsg
tharman and ng got gic to back them up,btohqsg
not voting for someone who associate with the u own nothing & u will be happy grp,btohqsg
ng literally has pm wife back him up,btohqsg
but the tan guy lost 48k in 2011,btohqsg
but how did lhl find him tho,btohqsg
if tkl didn’t compete in 2011 there would be another independent pres,btohqsg
YS MY FAVORUITE HELLO YOURE ALIVE,btohqsg
alternate universe where Pritam is PM would be weird,btohqsg
i rather pritam over kok song or tkl,btohqsg
what did the previous few pres achieve since nathan   nth,btohqsg
u think abt it   yet to see anyone who ‘s associated with wef looking sane,btohqsg
Tony tan did so much as a minister,btohqsg
