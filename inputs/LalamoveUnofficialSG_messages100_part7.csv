Personally i feel this is bulky n heavy for motorbike,btohqsg
As i say Fxxk the LLm  your delivery apps works 24 hours. Delivery guys are working and when we encounter problem now. No one to look for. CS suppose to work 24 hours too to help out any issue,btohqsg
I always have a small measuring tape with me. To show customer their item are out of the dimension. Motorcycle 40cmx25cmx25cm or car is 70cmx50cmx50cm.,btohqsg

Hello guys  I got furniture to move  do you think I can engage lalamove to move furniture to my new home?Things like1. Waredrobe2. Fridge3. DrawersCan share what lalamove do and don'ts?,btohqsg
I used to engage llm when im moving place. Usually i book 10ft/14ft lorry. With additional mover help or if i have heavy things  then i will request for tailgate so easier to load,btohqsg
My llm app still dont have the area options (east west north south),btohqsg
If u feel unjust  chat with CS ask them to look at the pic u uploaded. And change to Car type. I did before when I encounter similar cheapo merchants. CS amended it on the spot,btohqsg
Because I only want to move one piece of furniture  fridge. Wondering which type of car should I book. Haha,btohqsg
Will the LLM driver  help you load to house?,btohqsg
Van also might not fit.  Lorry better. Fridge cannot lay low,btohqsg

That's not the point..Why risk ur life n overload ur motorcycle.. life is more important than making a few customers feel shiok for saving money booking a motorcycle instead of a car..,btohqsg
new here  curious why people less interested to pick up orders from Little India ? any advice ?,btohqsg
"Which is why we still seeing motorcycle order  ""Please bring Trolley"". There are LLM car still accepting these  type of job. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ",btohqsg
Depends... Some order on the side road... Easy for pick up.,btohqsg
1. usually multiple dropoff which location dont really make sense  almost bring u on a half-island tour2. hard to find parking especially for cars cos its mostly roadside parking unless u enter the HDB carpark or URA parallel parking and then walk to the pickup point. If u lucky the shop is next to a double yellow line road where u pick and go3. sometimes the order is not ready when u arrive and they basically call for driver when the order is submitted to the kitchen4. cash order  troublesome to get the money after completioncan be 1 or more of the factors above.,btohqsg
Recieved HRW....still can work even though ART is negative?,btohqsg
