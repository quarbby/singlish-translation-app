I have so much to learn from you guys! Especially sir@awj_moodrecently he really say a lot of wise things,btohqsg
I think I missed the cue ü•π,btohqsg
Food for thought. If the gahment open a new coe category for phv  will Cat A  B and E go down?,btohqsg
it's called PHV for a good reason  private means privately owned car,btohqsg
cat B will reach 150k  cat A will reach 100k,btohqsg
Possible quota less than 1000 and always over bid,btohqsg
Rental company out many new cars for PHV usage,btohqsg
culprit found. what's a idiot. how can u hit and run when u r in geylang. thanks everyone,btohqsg
Culprit drove KIA / CARENS 1.7 DCT DIESEL 5DR FWD,btohqsg

Hyundai Ioniq 6 coupe (116) fan creation LOL,btohqsg

"Two major private-hire companies have denied bidding aggressively for COEs and pushing premiums up. ""There's no point. The bids are so high "" says one.https://cna.asia/3IRe0XY",btohqsg
excuses only... they bid high the cost also transfer to the hirer,btohqsg
as long as got people keep renting their cars they will keep doing it,btohqsg
they the drivers cry increased cost  and grab increase fares,btohqsg
And car owners just sit and can't do anything about it apart from paying a higher COE because the demand for ride hailing keeps going up,btohqsg
Hence the number of drivers and their cars,btohqsg
they need to renew their fleet,btohqsg
you think they will let those 7 year old Honda Vezels sit there ?,btohqsg
Many used cars around for sale.Don't have to buy new car.I bought a used 2yr old last year November.Not like everyone is gonna drive it for 10yrs. When new facelift or new technology is out.Most drivers will have some itch to change new model üòÇ,btohqsg
I agree! But used car market doesn't stand unaffected by rising COE prices and supply issues,btohqsg
Actually they can't renew as grab will not allow drivers to use more than 10 or 15 year old cars I believe,btohqsg
So they must buy new cars to lease out,btohqsg
I mean renew by buying new cars,btohqsg
Yuppp  need to replace the fleet,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt play a part.,btohqsg
In influencing the market forces for CoE,btohqsg
They might slow down right now  but need to pickup around 2025 when everything does come up for scrap,btohqsg
Yes. That why you need to negotiate hard.Tell the dealer  if you wanna sell me base on current COE price surge. Then I don't buy.You gonna have another month of no sales and 50-70 cars sitting in your showroom?Sell me cheaper. You get the cash from the bank  you can flip it.,btohqsg
pls u heng  wfh trend makes people sell cheap. now no more,btohqsg
