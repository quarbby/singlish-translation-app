I have Citi rewards Citi premier miles and UOB one credit card. And yuu and dbs altitude,btohqsg
citi rewards don't give 10x for travel,btohqsg
I see. Now I understand the dilemma above,btohqsg
So sir what would be the best option,btohqsg
Yes but don't and can't have UOB women's,btohqsg
Btw I’m sure someone in your family should be able to get uob lady card correct? Suggest u explore that.,btohqsg
Wife not working is it ok?,btohqsg
Can earn money by buying n selling car,btohqsg
If not then should I just do HSBC revolutions,btohqsg
Ok but will take time I'm so sorry for being so terrible,btohqsg
These are the 2 best cards I can think of for larger travel expenses.Let’s see if others have recommendations too.,btohqsg
U definitely should use amaze to save on the fx fees.,btohqsg
Uob lady and scb Manhattan? Thank you so much for your kind help,btohqsg
Ok then I will just use amaze with Citi premier miles,btohqsg
That’s only 1.2 miles per dollar right? Don’t think it’s good but I’ll let miles pro comment (I just started out using miles cards).,btohqsg
Yes. Unfortunately I don't have many good cards and time at hand. I have HSBC EGA with advance and revolutions. Then I have Citi rewards and premier miles. Uob one. Dbs yuu live fresh and altitude. Scb infinite and smart,btohqsg
"Also ppl need to know the difference between good debt and bad debt. A mortgage is an asset and hence a good debt. Bad debts are stuff like ""luxury"" goods  motor vehicles (in SG)  other wants (iphone  etc).Or just be like me#debtfree",btohqsg
Hi i’m a student here who wants to know how can i better work-school-life balance.who’s only available  wed thurs  sat and sun. I want to earn cash and have flexible timing. Like min 12 per hour  anything higher is a an added bonus. However i’m afraid i cannot cope with the workload of work and sch. Is there an alrernative for me to make money. As i need to fund for my course. I hope you guys have a solution too :),btohqsg
Be careful don’t fall for Money mule or job scams,btohqsg
open carousell account sell unused stuffs ?,btohqsg
Did that too but carousell waiting time is long. I dont thing investing in carousell coins to make it “sellable” is ideal what do u think ?,btohqsg
you male or female? female got more options.,btohqsg
just put that and do on free time  no need to buy coins  if not can do part time delivery like grab or foodpanda ?,btohqsg
Google part time jobs / job part time jobs channel on telegram,btohqsg
for your course why not take interest free loan?,btohqsg
Alright. Best if i did my research,btohqsg
I preorder some games online and sell them immediately at normal price in carousell when it releases.Can give you 10% profit 😊... Not bad for extra pocket money,btohqsg
Need to stalk online platforms like lazada  shopee etc and pre-ordered the games. Use vouchers and cc for discounts.And sell it in carousell at normal price when it is delivered to you..,btohqsg
I did that too but then i just want to earn enough to fund for my notebook course and also my daily expenses like transport and food. I basically want to be independent from my parents. I did work in the past before  just like i feel like now is the best time for me to get my own savings sorted out. I’m not very good at numbers but yeah  if anyone is in the same situation as me feel free :),btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if TCM can earn miles? If so  which card is best for it?,btohqsg
Why do u want to be independent from your parents while still on studying phase? Isn’t it more advisable to still continue to be financially reliant on your parents until you graduate? So u have more time to focus on your studies to achieve the best results u can?,btohqsg
Great question. In my current sem i have free time and possibly 10hrs of working time to spare  within that time frame i’m comfortably fine with getting a part time to “feed” myself. I still do get allowance from my parents however I appreciate them in their responsibility and thus be able to earn a “living” for myself. I’m turning 18 this year and in year 1 poly so,btohqsg
Wow u are a very “good child”.Sadly I don’t have any easy / safe way for u to earn > $12 per hour consistently based on your circumstances.,btohqsg
is there a reason why ocbc 365 credit card isn't much talked about? it seems quite competitive woth 6% on certain spend and also no category limits for overall cashback unlike other cards. how is it compared to other similar cards?,btohqsg
Max cashback $80 per month. Minimum $800 spend per month. More focus on dinning and fuel. You may want to compare this against Maybank FnF.,btohqsg
While 365 has good cashback on dining and petrol + it can get cashback on utilities and travel - some people don’t own a car and also most of my friends don’t pay bills for their household at all nor contribute for family groceries. Also it does not cover general retail stores and shoppee all those. And 800$ spend quite high.I personally use 365 cos I pay for family groceries + utilities which easily hit 500$+ a month alrd and 300$ for food a month is reasonable for fresh working adult. I also complement it with HSBC revo for retail spend and SC Smart for simplygo. Also helps for bonus interest from 360 account.But for others  no point using it when UOB Evol has almost similar cashback (5% I think isit?) or Miles chaser prefer CRMC or WWMC. If you want higher interest also UOB one better but I got hugely turned off by their CS from the early UOB absolute days that I refuse to deal with them any furtherTldr: only useful if spending for dining  petrol  utilities can hit 800$,btohqsg
Wah  $12/hour is quite a tall order for part time jobs. In current market you'd be lucky to even earn $10.50/hour,btohqsg
It’s not of a “ very good child “ type of appreciation i want to have but good discipline and ethics and virtues goes a long way. In terms of my financial journey,btohqsg
Hi i have a question  ive made a booking in feb via credit card dbs altitude. It has been paid. Today i cancelled the booking and money refunded. How do i cash out the refunded money?,btohqsg
think can go for the Amaze 4x instapoints promo if spend from Amaze wallet by 31 May  no fx fee. 4x instapoints equivalent to 4% rebate but need 2000 instapoints block to redeem cashback. I assuming you not paying more than $3k at one go cos Amaze wallet can hold $3k max. Topup Amaze wallet before the spend. Usually no rewards for the topup itself.https://www.instarem.com/blog/terms-and-conditions/instarem-amaze-wallet-may-4x-instapoints-wallet-2023-promo/,btohqsg
Ok yes I have amaze card which I forgot to mention in my summary msg. Will use that then. Thank you so much,btohqsg
call their hotline to transfer credit balance to your account,btohqsg
Personally  I had been granted by ocbc bank numerous times long time back. It was after 2 times that they informed me that I would be charged the next time onwards. I think it was considered an exception then. Not sure is that the case now?,btohqsg
Quick check. Is recurring bill payment to M1  Starhub  SP services and Senoko considered as an online transaction? Thanks folks:),btohqsg
Thanks for responding. I just called UOB bank and refer to them to my past recurring transactions. They told me they are online transactions. I would test it out and update the community next month.,btohqsg
Latest Tbill (16th May 2023) should be reflected both in CDP (cash) and Bank Internet Banking (CPF) as of now.,btohqsg
good to use if the bulk of ur balance is in 360 account and if ur salary credit is to this account also,btohqsg
Agree. But if you have credit card spend of 500$ each month  UOB one’s 4.05 % (I think) beats OCBC’s rate :) UOB’s credit cards are markedly better too for the merchants available for cashbackI prefer OCBC anyway personally for the better CS than UOB lol,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Newbie here. I would like to know which credit card is best suitable to use for GE insurance and Government hospital to earn back cashback,btohqsg
How long does it take for HSBC to approve credit card applications for existing customers? Am thinking if i shld apply for onetravel to enjoy lounge access but im flying this sat LOL,btohqsg
