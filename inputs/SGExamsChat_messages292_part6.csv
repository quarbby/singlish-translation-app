To all taking olvls  rmb to get sufficient rest and avoid any burnouts early on. You'd done all you can to get to this point  have faith in yourself and your abilities to perform!!!After every paper  pls do not be engrossed on whether your answer was correct or not  it may demoralise you and distract you. Stay focus on the subsequent papers and keep that momentum going. Jiayous to all ðŸ˜º,btohqsg

The sign flipping is making me confused,btohqsg
<= less then >= more than,btohqsg
like divide by neg and post number one,btohqsg
10 < -5x-2 < xX > -2,btohqsg
do a simple sanity check by subbing some value of x that you got in your final answer into the initial statement and see if it matches,btohqsg
eg you got x > -2  so x = -1 would be valid  but subbing it into 10 < -5x = 10 < 5 which is wrong,btohqsg
your mistake was when multiplying both sides by -1  you didn't flip the inequality. 2nd line,btohqsg
Hope that math paper one have more vector qns so can cancel out,btohqsg
but then if this qns that are not vector are difficult  then you lose even more marks,btohqsg
Yo that means u can rarely make mistakes in rest of qns and its harder to get A1 for first paper bro,btohqsg
