base on common MCC  Best Denki is 5732 which is under department stores,btohqsg
I would say NTUC voucher works the best if you are someone who always can hit $500  and for that month you short of $100. Can just top up $100 on NTUC voucher.But if you want to buy NTUC voucher every month just to promote to another tier  might not make sense for you. You might give up after a while.,btohqsg
Based on my tracking  I should not have a problem hitting 1k every month.Likely I‚Äôll stop @ 1k plus a bit to be safe  then I‚Äôll move on the next card.,btohqsg
Yup what other card u looking at,btohqsg
Awesome  base on your spending I guess UOB One is a very safe choice for cash back if you dont have specific high spending like grocery  dining or petrol.,btohqsg
anyone know if i use HSBC revo to buy $500 taka voucher for the free gift does it work?,btohqsg
My current plan would likely be1. UOB One2. CRMC + Amaze3. Absolute amexI‚Äôm more of a Cashback person  and I don‚Äôt really want to dilute the current miles effort that my wife is doing now,btohqsg
Ya I guess hsbc Revo can consider tooLike retail spend like ntuc or challenger or best denki for big ticket like tv,btohqsg
Yeah  my spendings are quite random  so when I compared between Ocbc 365 and UOB one.The UOB 1 is more suitable for my use case.Just need to put in a bit more effort to be mindful of my spending limits,btohqsg
HSBC Revo has cap spending reward for first $1000  but base on his tracking he shouldnt hit it.,btohqsg

Going for a trip and was wondering if the Citi PremierMiles card insurance cover my girlfriend,btohqsg
She is considered spouse on my book but legally we haven‚Äôt gone for ROM,btohqsg
She does hold a Citi cashback + card and I‚Äôm wondering if I should then let her buy separate then we purchase seats next to each other then both get to sit with one another,btohqsg
Citi PM insurance honestly is quite basic  i dont usually rely on it and just get it from proper insurance agents tho,btohqsg
