You can download GIRO from the Maybank website and fill up the Maybank CC details and HSBC EGA. Then you can post it. After few weeks (typically ~ 4 to 7 WKS) you can check with customer service to make sure GIRO is effective. Then you are in auto pilot mode. No need to pay CC bills manually,btohqsg

hello guys  is there any way to track on maybank's treatpoint accumulation,btohqsg
Can dbs yuu earn yuu points for pandapro subscription?,btohqsg
Actually if paying your various banks' credit Cards through giro from your EGA  you can try using any DBS credit card to pay for all your other banks' credit cards bills so that it is all consolidated in your dbs card. Then just need to giro payment from your EGA to DBS. Save you doing multiple giro forms from all different banks...,btohqsg
Not all cc can be paid with dbs,btohqsg
u mean Trust? Trust dun allow giro payment also anyway,btohqsg

Mmm but points already in wor  just annual fee being bill this month,btohqsg
Again  just read terms and conditions  you‚Äôll understand that bank is smarter than you in this question.,btohqsg
If you don't pay that AF  you own the bank money and the interest on cc is high,btohqsg
And if they can‚Äôt claw back the point   They will just simply charge you the point in cash term.,btohqsg

For setting up giro  need to go down to DBS bank to setup or hsbc ?,btohqsg
DBS. Get the form from the counter   filled and return to them  and wait for the confirmation that giro is set up .,btohqsg
can print the giro form and business reply envelope,btohqsg
Amaze+CRMC is still better than Choco-heymax?,btohqsg
For any transactions that are eligible for crmc bonus miles  imo is yes.,btohqsg
For fcy transactionsChoco-heymax:2mpd at 0% fcy fee over cc rateCrmc + amaze:4mpd at 2% fcy fee over cc rateLess 1% if you have HSBC ega setupIf you don't have HSBC ega for ur citi rewards  the result is a toss up.,btohqsg
Axs is not eligible for crmc so you should use heymax choco card.,btohqsg
Why a lot of people ask Choco card tied up with Heymax ? The tied up card is not even released n TnC is not even officially released n confirmed. Perhaps wait till it‚Äôs TnC is officially released  then we will have more clearer picture.,btohqsg
For amex  cimb or ocbc  is it worth it to apply for any of their card to clock big purchase and get bonus miles?,btohqsg
