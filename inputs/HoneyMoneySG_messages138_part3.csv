Not sure if any of you faced this issue with hsbc as well... Basically I've problen with (FAST) transferring money for my HSBC account to my dad's one in ocbc. Both app and website kept getting error msg. Finally I FAST transferred to my own account from HSBC to DBS  and then used DBS to transfer to my dad's ocbc account. Looks like hsbc has started the real time monitoring of large sum transfers so they switch off the transfer on weekend since no one is around to verify with clients? Anyone facing the same issue?,btohqsg

Hi all  may I ask for your advice on the best credit card based on my current spending habits. In terms of fixed costs  rent costs about $1k and util (SP+telco+wifi) costs about $80  transport around $120. My dining amounts to about $400 but I do restaurants maybe only 1-2 times a week  rest is hawker/fast food. Trying to cook more now so the cost will probably be transferred to groceries (~$120). I also do maybe 1 short trip and 1 long trip a year (usually $1k-$4k all inclusive).Would citi rewards+amaze be suitable for my everyday expenses and uob lady for travels? Just worried that I won't spend enough on uob lady's card beyond my few trips and won't get a waiver on subsequent years,btohqsg
could be due to this... Thanks Mt granny!https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/maintenance/maintenance.html,btohqsg
u can get max 50 miles bonus for 1k deposit and only 0.05% p.a. interest on the account. And you can easily get 3.05% p.a. interest on other accounts.3%√ó1k√∑12=$2.50 interestSo effective paying 250cents/50mile= 5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Any best or top miles credit card?,btohqsg
one that give most miles for your spending,btohqsg
