lol not sure. Nvm thanks ü§£,btohqsg
u talking about Max Miles? this is additional (awarded by Heymax) on top of the 4mpd for selected merchants,btohqsg
Oh I understand what you mean now bro. I'm still getting 4 miles. The max miles is not that important right ? Thanks for explaining,btohqsg
Max miles is additional miles (cannot redeem for kf miles though) so good for ppl who know how to utilize it,btohqsg
Got it thanks. One more thing bro. For UOB ladies just to confirm 4 miles can be earned by booking from the Agoda app ? Not using a UOB dedicated Agoda right (special link) ??,btohqsg
can if u using uob lady travel category,btohqsg
Heymax collab with some companies and give max miles if you go through them and make purchases. Always check the price though cuz it can be more ex,btohqsg
Just to confirm for travel spend more than $1000/month earns less than 4MPD ? I thought max was $2000 ?(According to Milelion),btohqsg
Any idea on how to change back the otp back to dbs app otp. Somehow my otp message change to sms otp that need to key in 6 digit otp.,btohqsg
2k is for UOB lady solitaire sir. Once you go over cap  it's 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Ahhhh got it thanks bro üëçüôè,btohqsg
One more question bro lol üòÇüòÇ  if I get the card after 01 Oct (4th quarter) what is the default category chosen ? If i get the card eg on 02 Oct  and if I choose travel   and book my air ticket on 19 October to get the 4 miles. Am I too late ?,btohqsg
i also just realized (this morning) cap at 2k... i have been spending 8k for past 3 months... damn wasted leh... üòî,btohqsg
Any advice what card to explore (main spent is air tickets)... i already got UOB One  Lady card  dbs safra  evol  uob absolute cashback  hsbc advance... still need 1 more (ideally cashback but miles also can),btohqsg
Better late than never bro. At least you found out and can change spending style starting today .,btohqsg
When you apply  they will ask you to choose category,btohqsg
Too bad no sign up card  bonus for new to bank customers (for UOB ladies card) ü•π,btohqsg
For uob  sign up prvi miles first with annual fee paying option  then sign up uob lady after.,btohqsg
Sorry bro may I ask why ?,btohqsg
If you want signup bonus  that is most reliable uob signup bonus for miles chaser.,btohqsg
uob krisflyer don't have promo for existin customer right?,btohqsg
Pattern quite familiar not gonna lie üòî,btohqsg
Ya bro . but the disadvantage of PRIV is I need to book direct from their website airline using Expedia (which I can't choose my seats). üòÇ Inorder to get higher miles,btohqsg
Who is Terry? What's the case about him ?,btohqsg
You can look at DBS womans world card. 4mpd up to 1.5k online spend in a month  suitable for your air ticket purchase,btohqsg
I got that card for sign up bonus only. On the rare month i exceed my cap  i use as backup.,btohqsg
UOB kf signup bonus only for new to bank?,btohqsg
Hi does CRMC+amaze work for banquet spending MCC 7011? How to check on this ?,btohqsg
does anyone know if buying the $128 adult transport concession on scb smart card gets you the bonus points?,btohqsg
Signing up for Tada as a first time user‚Ä¶ anyone wanna give me their referral code,btohqsg
I just applied uob kf. I hope it‚Äôs a good addition card..,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
well u do get 5 000 welcome miles upon making your first UOB KF CC transaction.. does that count?,btohqsg
Issit! I didn‚Äôt know.. within how many months? I,btohqsg
upon making ur first transaction. Credit begining of next month after the transaction,btohqsg
"minimum $5 can liao..note that the welcome miles gets credited directly into your Krisflyer account  so you won't see it in your UOB statement.There appears to be no time frame as well. I didn't know of this 5 000 welcome bonus until like many months after i got the card and used it for the first time. I saw some funny 5 000 ""First card spend' bonus comment in my Krisflyer statement then i went to find out what it was.",btohqsg
Aside from CRMC  I am using kf as my spare miles card. In case I have big spendings.,btohqsg
oh this strategy should totally change since recently  Maybank World Mastercard has been revamped and could be considered to be everyone's backup BIG FOREIGN CURRENCY SPEND card.3.2mpd if you spend over $4k per calender month. Don't think there is any comparable card to this at this point in time with the death of Amaze+UOBKFCC.,btohqsg
is it worth for Smart CC to change miles ?,btohqsg
Hi all  i using UOB KF card on ShopBack pay in store  is it consider online transaction?Thanks,btohqsg
local SGD spend  big spending backup cards could include UOB Visa Signature ($1-2k per month)If super big like over $10k per month  I also dunno what liao.. maybe UOB PRVI 1.4 mpd,btohqsg
Awww.. then I applied wrong card üò¢,btohqsg
Mine is mostly online spending and more than 2k üò¨,btohqsg
yes UOB KF CC is only 1.2mpd for normal usage which isn't that good.ok i saw you said ONLINE SPENDING. UOB KF CC can be 3mpd if:1. you spend more than $800 on SQ group AND2. you spend ONLINE at whitelisted merchants,btohqsg
If you have big online spend (excluding TRAVEL)  you can consider Citi SMRT card. 5% cashback for online spend  capped at $12k per card year,btohqsg
Hi all  for the hsbc live+ card  the 600 dollar must it be cash back eligible merchant or it can be any purchase as long as it doesn‚Äôt land in the exclusion?,btohqsg
I anticipated my spendings will be more than 12k a year for online so I skipped this card. 5% is good.. but I don‚Äôt want to track so many cards and I think I can meet the $800 a year for SQ group.,btohqsg
I am using my Citibank cashback for dining  taxi  grocery and petrol liao. So the miles card is for my online spendings for business expenses.,btohqsg
Actually I have AMEX TC  UOB Absolute and OCBC infinity. All unlimited caps. I wonder if it‚Äôs better than UOB kf?,btohqsg
