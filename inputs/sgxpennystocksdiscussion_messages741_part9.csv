Eneco looks very good. I think earlier flush out some weaker hands at $0.011 too. I like how they do it. Consistency and strength in the simplest form. $0.011 should be a nice price to collect this one,btohqsg
i think they ran quite a bit already.Also the place need to secure funding soon.Their gearing too high for my liking.  156% is over geared   even for developers.,btohqsg
Once  the money issues come and if they cannot secure more loans/ raise funds  got small chance to go JM,btohqsg
Any counters over 50% gearing  need to careful. Always have chance for suspension eventually when creditor go after them,btohqsg

US indices drop  oil fell but Coal counters green. Hmmm 🧐 does someone knows something,btohqsg
Europe Energy Crisis Faces Grim Winter Trials — BloombergBloomberg columnist Javier Blas has undercut attempts to declare the worst of Europe’s energy crisis over  warning just a few windless days or degrees Celsius dropped could plunge the continent into blackouts.Although since August natural gas prices have dropped to $210 per megawatt hour from a $368 peak and electricity prices have more than halved  energy commodities remain seven and 10 times higher than the 2000-2020 period respectively.Germany has been forced to use coal power to generate 40% of its power last week after drops in wind  while a total of $736 billion has already been spent on energy company subsidies.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
Many nations turning to use the coal stockpiles. Once use need to replenish. Maybe that’s why coal counters doing well because of the foreseeable demand,btohqsg
After the winter  coal price will come down if oil stay at current level,btohqsg
Coal strong during winter months DEC to Early March usually.Once more news on blackouts  and talk of more energy crunch  counter should perform,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 7 December 2022🎉🎲It's fear time🧸The equity market wobbled on Tuesday  clouded by a renewed fear of the possible recession  which led Wall Street to extend losses. Fear deepens as JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon cautioned the possibility of a mild slowdown despite consumers in good financial condition.As the interest rate continues to rise  investors are trying to determine the lag time of its impact and the degree of damage in restricting economic demand. As a result  major indices dived solidly  with Pika World's favourite Russell most impacted in a recession mood.🎢Bond market re-surface worry💣Pika World is seeing bond yields inching higher as it hit 4.358%  above the 4.2% where it was just before the job report on Friday. It is not a far cry from the multi-year high of 4.7%. It is a reflection of the cliff level of policy uncertainty ahead.Macro trends continued to be the hurdles. We have the Fed policy  the Ukraine war and China's covid policy  although the last component appears to be brighter daily. We also observed the S&P 500 unable to close above 4080 decisively as it hit resistance and sellers hitting the indices downward.💎Cut  Cut  Cut  it's time to get lean🔫Staying lean and fit is everyone's dream. But it could be a nightmare for employees at Morgan Stanley as the company announced trimming down some fats of its employment size by 2% of its global workforce size.It comes at a challenging time for banks  even for Pika World's favourite Bank of America. We are seeing business activity falling as new merger deals weaken. The same applies to new stock issuance  which is lucrative bank fees. Hence  the investment banking business will likely contribute to a giant vacuum for the bank in the next earnings season.📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will have the Unit Labor Cost for QoQ  which is expected to moderate to 3.1% from 3.5%.It is 7 December  Wednesday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a profitable trading week!,btohqsg
