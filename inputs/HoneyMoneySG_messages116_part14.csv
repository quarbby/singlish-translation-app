Do note this also means SSB is not guaranteed given this. (Since in this case the backing is on the SG govt),btohqsg
What I want to point out in terms of protection  they are not in the same level. But I agreed risk of capital loss for syfe cash plus is very remote,btohqsg
Non Capital guaranteed kinda means your ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù might lose money which is not the case for syfe cash guaranteed lol,btohqsg
Arguable. The fixed deposits are by hsbc from what‚Äôs written. Yes there may be no direct SDIC but very unlikely for hsbc deposits to default. U are not taking Syfe credit risk.,btohqsg
If a Company is at risk  the money that placed in bank depositas an investmentwill be formed part of assets of the Company during liquidation process n can be seized to pay off its debt and liabilities first instead of transferring back to the investors.The deposit that placed in bank by the company will notsolelybelongs to the investors. Hence  not insure by SDIC.I have no financial knowledge on this n have zero background. Can somebody who has financial background confirm Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
1) Syfe is not able to use the money stored in HSBC for its own use. I believed even in the situation where it goes bust2) client‚Äôs money is protected from syfe creditors even if syfe needs to liquidated assets3) in the event of closure  syfe WILL transfer the money or assets to other FI or return the assets or money to clients. Probably similar to moneyowl,btohqsg
In such case of the investment company collapse  I don‚Äôt think the custodian bank will not automatically return the money in the account to the investors even though it is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù.,btohqsg
This seems to imply the Hsbc deposits are all pooled together from all the syfe guaranteed investors. So not Individually owned or assigned.So I do believe in a case of syfe running into trouble  it would be joint ownership or division by all similar investors.So if there is fraud involved where the funds are stolen u might not get back in full.However I do not believe it is a case where syfe guaranteed investments would be considered as part of syfe assets.,btohqsg
I would put the risk is minimized whereas investors  you might not suffer the whole loss  but what you recover also may not be in full and there is no definite timeline when you can get back depending on the legal process. So I guess is the difference between SDIC protected and not.,btohqsg
Money invested in syfe are never considered as syfe assets.If you‚Äôre talking about fraud  this applies to any banks out there.,btohqsg
Actually sdic hasn‚Äôt been tested and proven yet. So‚Ä¶. Haha,btohqsg
At least the framework is there. Similar like a company business continuity plan in crisis  we know there is a plan black and white in place. But for Sfye and other investment house  they tell you your capital is protected but beyond that  we don‚Äôt have visibility or how it suppose to work if things goes wrong.,btohqsg
Good discussion. Teaches us never to take things at face value,btohqsg
But do SDIC actually tell you how you will get your money back and when?,btohqsg
They have this statement ‚ÄúYour monies placed with a Scheme member bank under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) and CPF Retirement Sum Scheme (CPFRS) are aggregated and separately insured up to S$100 000.As your insured deposits are covered under the DI Scheme  SDIC will pay you the insured amounts if your bank or finance company fails.‚Äù So if Sfye is willing to put down a similar statement saying they will pay investors back up to xxx amt in event the company fails,btohqsg
‚Äúensure the orderly transfer of money and assets to other licensed financial institutions or the return of all money and assets to clients.‚ÄùIsn‚Äôt stating ‚Äúall‚Äù good enough?,btohqsg
Is this statement from Sfye? Anyway  the word ‚Äúor‚Äù means it may or may not happen. Also without words like ‚Äúthey will return‚Äù doesn‚Äôt reinforce strongly that they will return all money to clients regardless. But language is subject to interpretation especially if not looking at from whole context. I just looking at from one angle.,btohqsg
Of coz it‚Äôs a statement from syfe? Where will I pluck this out from lolDid you read the statement before and after the ‚Äúor‚Äù? Either they transfer to another FI and you withdraw or they return the money if they can‚Äôt find a FI willing to take over. Same as what moneyowl and ifast did last year.Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreturn all‚Äù the same as ‚Äúthey will return‚Äù,btohqsg
They will transfer to other FI but it never said you can withdraw 100% and when after that. Moneyowl wind down business and not collapse. These are 2 different scenarios. That is benefit of SDIC protection. Regardless of situation or wording we may interpret  we will get our deposits back. Anyway on Sfye site  they stated their investment should not be taken as deposit.,btohqsg
Wow shiok. How come I cannot get/see on my app,btohqsg

For point 3  does it need to be from a corporate account? Or any bank account? How does it work?,btohqsg
