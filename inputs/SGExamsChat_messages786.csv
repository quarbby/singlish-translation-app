some they don't know how to say pigeon in chinese they say chicken in chinese,btohqsg
"btw got any1 chinese oral the cher is like ""you may leave"" after u r done",btohqsg
idk the cher got a quite fierce face,btohqsg
is the cher from other schools?,btohqsg
It’s been a long day and cher is feeling the fatigue bah. Is it an airconditioned venue?,btohqsg
Imagine having to smile the entire duration,btohqsg
i think shld be like almost 2 hrs from start so ye ig,btohqsg
actually cld be he so disgusted by my chinese,btohqsg
after lessons still have to listen to so many students,btohqsg
Cher is upset you do better than his student?,btohqsg
btw can help me in the Os chat,btohqsg
How did chou tien chien beat viktor axelsen,btohqsg
Are we gonna see the 3rd upset of the QF lmao,btohqsg
ive never lost to chou tien chien therefore im better than axelsen,btohqsg
been awhile since i watch badminton,btohqsg
Earlier on  Malaysia beat Japan (Men)  Indonesia beat Thailand (women)  now Chinese Taipei gonna beat 2nd seed Denmark (???),btohqsg
It is now 2-0 in favour of chinese taipei,btohqsg
See if anders antonsen can turn things ard (he losing 1st set tho),btohqsg
Because you have never played chou tien chien💀,btohqsg
There maybe another upset coz korea may outdo indonesia in the other men’s qf clash,btohqsg
Dun be like me who stayed up till 5am to watch loh kean yew world champs finals,btohqsg
I think the match ended at 6am💀,btohqsg
Malaysia vs Japan not upset could have been 3-0,btohqsg
Neh Japan was the clear favourites,btohqsg
Malaysia’s first semi finals since 2016,btohqsg
But they may turn things ard if they had fielded kodai naraoka,btohqsg
they also not have their full team,btohqsg
Coz kenta nishimoto would hv defeated leong jun hao,btohqsg
But im guessing they put kenta in first singles coz he had a better h2h w lee zii jia than naraoka,btohqsg
Indonesia losing singles matches will be big upset,btohqsg
Coz if they fielded them both  naraoka would be in 1st singles and nishimoto 2nd singles,btohqsg
I was wondering why japan didnt really field naraoka (i think he only played 1 of 4 matches),btohqsg
Lin chun yi vs Anders antonsen (1-0),btohqsg
But if Antonsen somehow wins still could be 1-3 or 2-3,btohqsg
Why not they all win the last 3 matches,btohqsg
Apparently they did that in 2016,btohqsg
the rest of the matches are 50-50,btohqsg
Meanwhile I stayed up till 5 to a rerun of a internal soccer game at jalan besar stadium. After 3-4hrs. I still don't know who scored and who are the players,btohqsg
Dont think too much about it   the cher is probably just tired and sian because of a long day at work. Dontworry its not directed at you,btohqsg
Uber cup redemption for these small small players,btohqsg
Leong jun hao my friend sia,btohqsg
feels abit odd to see some of my p6 classmates on insta stepping down from their ccas,btohqsg
feels a bit odd to see someone whom I copied hw from in y2 get scolded for not doing hw today,btohqsg
i think kuro sent this here before,btohqsg
At least the teacher cares…tbh some students really be testing teacher’s patience,btohqsg
My nausea came right at the night before my examGG.com,btohqsg
I gave up coz i cant push myself to revise feeling nauseous,btohqsg
Btr now then during the exam tho:-(Just praying i dun wake up w one tmr,btohqsg
My stomach decided to cramp during my exam... works surprisingly well as a motivator for me to write as fast as possible,btohqsg
I cant do anything w stomach cramps / headaches,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of cramp or headache,btohqsg
Migraine and for cramps isit stabbing or knots,btohqsg
aye shit ikea jarvfjalley chair sold out?💀,btohqsg
I got invite to play badminton,btohqsg
Sometimes it can be a dull stabbing,btohqsg
the fact i know what that is lol,btohqsg
i ended up paying quite a lot for a chair since i spend like 7-8 hours per day sitting on it for work,btohqsg
What accents can you fake? (If any),btohqsg
most of the time my headache is nauseous type:-(,btohqsg
actually in the letter invitation they gave the NS form for NS men to seek excuse,btohqsg
They mentioned can use that to seek excuse fr camp,btohqsg
Else you think how the ns awardees manage to go,btohqsg
"Singapore's Loh Kean Yew is gearing up for his second Olympics while dealing with a long-term injury that flared up recently - and he doesn't want it to be an ""excuse"" ahead of the Games.https://cna.asia/3WpZC1N",btohqsg
🌧 Heavy rain has prompted flood warnings across large parts of Singapore on the morning of May 4 as well as delays at Changi Airport.https://str.sg/qSqf,btohqsg
Fun fact: the first thing i saw after stepping out of the exam hall,btohqsg
Has there ever been exams on a PH,btohqsg
Yea but they just shifted the ph to another day,btohqsg
HUH what??? That is not allowed,btohqsg
my bad i meant 2023  they just push the dates back lorh,btohqsg
basically as what she mentioned..technically its possible  they just push the PH to another day and replace that current day with the more impt event..whether its a exam  national event etc,btohqsg
Days allocated as PH can be shifted if needed,btohqsg
but obivously if she meant original dates being PH..then its no possible unless you got a royal fuckup at both MOE and SEAB,btohqsg
there is no exams on holiday,btohqsg
if at the start of the year  moe annouce that eg. 16 sept is a public holiday...they could if they needed to down the line in aug announce that the PH designated for 16 sept has been shifted down the road to 21 sept and then conduct exams on 16 sept.,btohqsg
Didnt they just change the date of the exams?,btohqsg
Because it was pre-scheduled before the PE date was announced,btohqsg
either can be changed  but changing a PH is more unlikely than changing a exam date,btohqsg
I remember the exam was moved to 12 september,btohqsg
PH invovles everybody in sg..thats the main reason why but both can be changed,btohqsg
Yea what happened was i believe some exams were already scheduled. Then polling day was announced and then they rescheduled those exams away fr the ph,btohqsg
Why would PH moved down the road?,btohqsg
they could if they wanted to is what im saying. if they want to conduct a national day of mourning for someone and just so happens it falls on a PH..they could shift the PH to a day later,btohqsg
in sg  Scheduled holidays  PH and Exam dates can all be shifted...Its just a determination of which one is a easier and less destructive shift,btohqsg
so there is no exams on PH,btohqsg
technically yes because that day will no longer be a PH,btohqsg
May the 4th be with yall,btohqsg
anyone got h1 bio notes 😊,btohqsg
I wished i had this when i was taking my A levels,btohqsg

I paid for the stake of prelim papers for 3 subjects💀,btohqsg
Coz i was kiasu and my sch started printing dann late,btohqsg

Ok tbh they only printed phy for us i think,btohqsg
i dun rmb what MI printed for us,btohqsg
🦠 Would you intentionally expose yourself to an infectious disease for the sake of science?Singapore embarks on its first challenge study this year  exposing participants to the virus that causes COVID-19.Two bioethics experts discuss how risky such studies are and how they can be conducted responsibly.

I think I just have high expectations for like dumplings or wanton of any kind,btohqsg
i remember fried rice is less than $15 noodles less than $15 and handmade buns less than $10,btohqsg
now the noddles ard 15 and 6 pcs of dim sum r like almost 10,btohqsg
not as much variety as i rmb,btohqsg

I was planning to do my essay today,btohqsg
But the weather I just slept instead,btohqsg
Yeah the essay.. humanities is just a deadline which for me I got an extension so it's next Monday 2359,btohqsg
Hv not thought of it  maybe it is the weather that is making me sleep,btohqsg
I slept for like 14 hours liao it's the kind whereby i woke up tired now. But still was nice,btohqsg
How u gonna sleep ltr lol,btohqsg
That's a good question. And a question I only am to address later at 12am,btohqsg
with that amount of pork  can be considered halal 💀,btohqsg
yes  if u think anything with pork is totally halal,btohqsg
NICE time to pay up ur sleep debt considering that u sleeping very less hours as a student.,btohqsg
praying that n levels this year doesn’t get pushed to an earlier date because of some idk,btohqsg

I took a TCM class this sem.. one day my prof enters the class with literally an entire bushel of herbs from the garden,btohqsg

No they also show how to do that too,btohqsg
also gude this year ur men's football team top 4 (if u r from ri),btohqsg
anyone been to a chiropractor..the other day i think i performed a chiropractor move on myself in the toilet 💀,btohqsg
Minh asked me to send one💀,btohqsg
cuz that time u said u couldnt stop laughing,btohqsg
No why it is getting hot again,btohqsg
Minh wanted to laugh so she asked me send my laughter,btohqsg
i think she meant her laugh is thelaughing stockof this channel,btohqsg
I remember I made a comment about it too but cannot remember what I said,btohqsg
Oh yeah that she said she was the class clown or smth,btohqsg
well can backread lah but i lazy,btohqsg
yes she is but her school's men's football team made it to jalan besar this year,btohqsg
But your acads make up for it ig,btohqsg
bit when they play against u they are 10000x better than you,btohqsg
okay promote u to homeless man,btohqsg
Nah I can beat them in squash no cap,btohqsg
I long time nvr play squash sia,btohqsg
And I might  MIGHT be called up to play,btohqsg
TM might call u up to play A div squash for them,btohqsg
Lol nyjc our boys team win against them,btohqsg
Girls team lost to them once again,btohqsg

I cannot and i cant how,btohqsg
feels so nice not having to stress abt WA,btohqsg

I need someone to insult me. Would anyone be open to fill the shoes of bedok and call me an idiot and ck warrior pls,btohqsg
Is it just me or was BlackBerry mostly a business phone in Singapore?,btohqsg
i think this one ask ur grandparents better,btohqsg
you cant do anything else with that,btohqsg
I think mostly because BBM never became big in Singapore,btohqsg
i rmb owning a black berry and my samsung m7500 had more features than the black berry,btohqsg
(also I suspect data plans were too expensive back then before 4G andCircles.life),btohqsg
Also holy shit I forgot about that Samsung Armani phone. You were rich bro!,btohqsg
I never really got why BBM never took off in Singapore though  looking back,btohqsg
It could have been WhatsApp before WhatsApp,btohqsg
I suspect BlackBerry just never really needed to expand out of the business market they had a stranglehold on,btohqsg
Until the iPhone ate into that  by which time it was too late,btohqsg
No one used BlackBerry unless you needed to for work  it didn't make sense otherwise.,btohqsg
(also it was a looser time for data security in Singapore),btohqsg
I think better than pizza places,btohqsg
cuz if it is in squares the likelihood is not fresh pizza,btohqsg
this one the pizza slices in triangles,btohqsg
have you tried their signature garlic sauce?,btohqsg
I open Instagram and I see doxxing lol,btohqsg
Better than Ronald McDonald's creamy surprise,btohqsg
Full name full location school name class name postal code,btohqsg
apparently this doxxed guy did some pretty bad stuff,btohqsg
also clucking his chicken in weird places,btohqsg
yeah apparently bro did it in front of his sister,btohqsg
don't forget  we are from our mother's wombs,btohqsg
I love kicking my mom 🥰,btohqsg

no I am from Pulau Ujong,btohqsg
was gonna tabao it but realise is hotplate lol,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion: the 4th Telco should have been CMLink instead of TPG,btohqsg
unpopular opinion  Trans island services should not have merged with SMRT,btohqsg
CMLink is owned by China Mobile  the biggest telco in China  with much better reliability in its home country compared to TPG's reliability in Australia. SIMBA had a really rough start  and even now they're barely okay  definitely the worst of the big 4 tbh,btohqsg
fr my i used to use tpg and its coverage in mrt esp was bad,btohqsg
now im using gomo tho its 2x lol,btohqsg
eh i think u should join the TM eats channel,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion: why have a 4th telco  just buy a mvno sim card,btohqsg
I hit my quota for sleep from yesterday,btohqsg
this is $7.90 at food panda here,btohqsg
ystd when i was taking a shit in a mall toilet,btohqsg
there were 2 landline phone numbers under the toilet paper dispenser  with a date 💀💀💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
oso btw is it u write ur own testimonial?,btohqsg
why the bus  alighting at every stop,btohqsg
Cause i would only have 1 sgc at the end of y6,btohqsg
So idk how sec4 sgc is like,btohqsg
How do ppl spoiler a photo,btohqsg
I saw someone spoiler a photo before leh,btohqsg
I only know how to spoiler words,btohqsg
It is not random coz my point was idk how I wasted so much time in the toilet,btohqsg
It's an SCP. Time dilates and warps around the toliet. Although u may have spent 10 mins on the toliet accounting for relativity 50 years has passed,btohqsg
i tot testimonial is usually like a teacher/mentor/bosss liddat write one,btohqsg
Ok la my sec sch is,btohqsg
Then the chers verify n write in full,btohqsg
JC also…we write whatever stuff we want the chers include then cher write the testimonial,btohqsg
Coz not possible for the Cher to know everything about their students also,btohqsg
All school achivements they know. If you have external achievements tell them,btohqsg
My Cher told us if we don’t write  they have nothing to say and the testimonial will be very short,btohqsg
Tmjc service award (merit) [Squash quartermaster],btohqsg

abit black cus idh wire cutter to remove the cover lol,btohqsg
do you guys prefer to do work on tablet or pen and paper,btohqsg
tbh i still prefer pen and paper T_T,btohqsg
@kohsyani got a Samsung tablet (more like my parents wanted me to get one) and the notetaking function is quite nice,btohqsg
Tbh i converted to ipad only coz there are too many paper to print,btohqsg
i only got a tablet after 3rd year of uni. difference in the actual writing experience isn't too big for me but the convenience is indispensable now,btohqsg
esp for my current work  and i tend to scribble a lot when thinking so less wasted paper,btohqsg
I got now even though i say idw then my parent insisted cause they say my pld was too heavy,btohqsg
I think am just not used to writing on tablets,btohqsg
if it's samsung s pen it's p similar feeling to writing on a notebook,btohqsg
Now bio is all online materials and then i still make hand written notes,btohqsg
i did 80 pages of calculations the other day on my tablet. imagine me doing that on paper then carrying that around whenever i gotta reference it,btohqsg
for me it's rlly more of the tablet suiting my needs,btohqsg
i carry both my laptop and tablet everywhere lol,btohqsg
mini screaming in Quantum Mech finals prep,btohqsg
shits ugly but hopefully it works lol,btohqsg
I have not even finish learning complex syllabus,btohqsg
I am overly focused on QM  I did not study complex at all 😭,btohqsg
Im bout to take a nap because im tired of reading 12 tut in a row,btohqsg
Tut 12 killed me so bad i couldnt understand anything for a good hour,btohqsg
pen and paper  my handwriting gets ugly if i write on a screen,btohqsg
but my school material is mostly all online now so,btohqsg
if yall find the right hdb corridor. you can get good views of sg,btohqsg
need to get wire cutter oso,btohqsg
gg alot of things to do,btohqsg
Tbh i write very slowly on ipad also (more of coz i cannot write nice then keep erasing),btohqsg
Me sometimes too when i just need 2 devices,btohqsg
Siyan: ‘At least it is still progress’,btohqsg
No my last paper is tmr,btohqsg
If AM exam i would be more in a panic,btohqsg
My friday one was 230pm and i was so grateful,btohqsg
I wasnt grateful for the finals tho fk that paper but it is what it is,btohqsg
Lucky I hall but still damn shag,btohqsg
Meanwhile i dun understand how ppl finish their paper so early,btohqsg
JC/Secondary: Finish fast is smartUni: Finish fast is fucked,btohqsg
The guy beside me finished the entire paper in 1 hour,btohqsg
And he actually did it because i was observing him writing all sorts of shit,btohqsg
Engineering I hear for some can legit just do 1 question as long as all correct can liao,btohqsg
The entire 2 hours exam i only counted 3 people leaving early,btohqsg
He came in with pt shorts and only one pen and a calculator  i knew this man would be cooking alr,btohqsg
Wa that one guarantee u he has been burning midnight oil and only open the material 1 day before.,btohqsg
idk leh it seems to be working for him,btohqsg
because from what i saw he actually legit finished the paper properly,btohqsg
It does lmao somehow manage to pass one walao,btohqsg
DSA i saw a whole row empty lmao,btohqsg
need to watch sum yt vids lol,btohqsg
Im really surprised prof allowed someone beside me to be talking to his friends in the exam hall when the 2h has not been up,btohqsg
sounds like a prof that could not be bothered with paperwork,btohqsg
Even if they have already submitted their work  bruh the exam is still ongoing,btohqsg
I read yt as bedok at first lmao,btohqsg
Maybe he prepared well and is confident abt the paper,btohqsg
Man crushed a paper that nobody else left early for,btohqsg
Usually finals there would always be a handful that leaves early,btohqsg
But for this exam mostly nobody left,btohqsg
I always finish right on the dot (if i actually finish),btohqsg
Use this meme as a classic rule of thumb 👍,btohqsg
oh i didnt know they would apply an adjustment if it doesnt meet their requirement,btohqsg
Gude if u liked eggs shouldn't it be 🥚or 🐣 instead of 🥑.,btohqsg
yeah not something i would put all my eggs in the basket for,btohqsg
I know for large cohort they will use it because they can. CLT and moderation in general requires a large enough sample size,btohqsg
too bad physics has a cohort of <100,btohqsg
typical h2 math question would be like  how large should n be,btohqsg
Usually oni if n more than 100 than can,btohqsg
okay la ps2 has bio chem and math + all the other double degree spms peeps so still can moderate,btohqsg
Although like 40 or 30 is the absolute minimum,btohqsg
but obv im not gonna go into the finals thinking about that,btohqsg
If we all fail it becomes a systemic risk and the schools problem,btohqsg
Exams are regulated by OAS although it's a convened board decision which is made mostly of Profs it's also very much skewed to administrative sensitivities too,btohqsg
no need to tell me all that,btohqsg
For the administration they actually do. If all fail means retake and u gotta accommodate the entire cohort,btohqsg
More headache as u gotta scale it up and find more ppl,btohqsg
i think writing on the ipad too much is making me disoriented with real life,btohqsg
i was drawing a line on my physical cheatsheet and i was holding my pen there waiting for the line to be straight...,btohqsg
the soldering iron had no on and off button oso,btohqsg
so must rmb to power off from the plug lol,btohqsg
why he did not leave the exam hall?,btohqsg
not easy to write on screen,btohqsg
Not a good Term 2 tbh,btohqsg
He was settling his laptop stuff and then his friends came down at the same time and then they started talking for 1-2min before finally leaving,btohqsg
Driving centres probably easing up on who they're giving their licenses to,btohqsg
i wanna waste my money and buy discord profile effects,btohqsg
oh wow how much was it,btohqsg
if you see value in it it’s not a waste of money,btohqsg

Hey sup did anyone else receive or not yet receive NUS biz admin offered< i heard a batch was release on 4th Mayyy,btohqsg
i haven received a rejection but does anyone know when the next batch release is ah,btohqsg
idt anyone other than the admissions officer wld know this,btohqsg
if i don received any news hor i could still wait for the second window right,btohqsg
by that time i wld start considering alternative plans alr,btohqsg
although i wouldn't hold out much hope for appealing,btohqsg
icc i alre got offer from ntu,btohqsg
just that i prefer nus and smu,btohqsg
wld u rather NTU or not have a uni spot,btohqsg
if NUS dun accept then next year try again,btohqsg
then if nus offer next year,btohqsg
if still cmi then the year after try again,btohqsg
i got SMU offer a different year and i cld accept if i wanted to,btohqsg
thx ah bro for the advice,btohqsg
if you play your cards right can grad in 2.5,btohqsg
i sort of prefer like longer uni life for some reason,btohqsg
depends on what you want to do in uni ig,btohqsg
u can alw underload in ntu and do 4 years,btohqsg
HAHAHA yea thats wat i was thinking also,btohqsg
u think about it ah NTU 3 year + 1 year LOA vs SMU/NUS 4 years + 1 year LOA,btohqsg
up to you la but unless you think NUS/SMU academic wise stronger  imo no reason to not go NTU,btohqsg
(and biz academic standing aso not much use lol),btohqsg
act ye but curious also ah why u didn choose to go smu,btohqsg
is it cause of the shorter grad ah,btohqsg
personal reasons aside  shorter grad  easier to get hall (for that#hallife),btohqsg
yea i also wanted hall life,btohqsg
i can grad in 2.5 years,btohqsg
what are ur objectives though in uni,btohqsg
but i know ppl in ntu biz who underload every sem,btohqsg
so they can stay in uni for longer,btohqsg
ps i don get the term underload,btohqsg
u mean like loa la right,btohqsg
take lesser mods than you're supposed to,btohqsg
then u got time for other stuff lor,btohqsg
like part time intern  play around  etc,btohqsg
i mean like still 4 years but all 4 years you're less stressed than your NUS/SMU peers cause you have less work to do,btohqsg
and NTU hall first 2 years confirm can get,btohqsg
yea i heard the confirmed 2 years or smt for new students,btohqsg
eh thx ah bro for ur insights HAHHAA,btohqsg
if got ntu qns can ask me hahahaha,btohqsg
at least now i got more perspective to make my decisions,btohqsg
idk anyone here in NUS/SMU biz ah but good to talk to them aso bah,btohqsg
if not open house all v rosy opinions,btohqsg
half truths during open house or  just flat lies,btohqsg
that is why i nvr participated in open house,btohqsg
and if i did i wld go terribly off script,btohqsg
why didn’t I secure my water bottle,btohqsg
anyone knows any place where I can repair laptop,btohqsg
my water bottle leaked and I think the water went into the laptop,btohqsg
but when I turn it on at home it started,btohqsg
does it make any error sound?,btohqsg
by right Thinkpad should give error sound  if not is mother board totally gone,btohqsg
but it was ok just now right? So you might be right water is in,btohqsg
if u know how to open the laptop  open it  dry the water inside  use a fan and blow on it for 8 hours at least,btohqsg
opening it a bit harder  nowadays they don't use screws. So it's like sliding a card at the sides to open it. You might break some parts in the process but no choice.,btohqsg
can search youtube for your model,btohqsg
this one is irreparable liao right 💀,btohqsg
even better  just open  likely a drop of water or two that is causing shorts on some circuitry.,btohqsg
but don't on it again for today,btohqsg
use a fan blow on it,btohqsg
highest likelihood is water went from bottom of laptop. The keyboard at the top is anti-water,btohqsg
