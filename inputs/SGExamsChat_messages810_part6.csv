Can someone ask me about enzymes,btohqsg
Enzymes are biological catalysts that lower the activation energy of a reaction  allowing a more efficient pathway for the reaction to take place. The formation of an enzyme-substrate complex lowers the activation energy. There are 4 ways in which an enzyme-substrate complex lowers activation energy:proximity effect  strain effect  orientation effect and microenvironment effect.There are 2 models of enzymatic action  the lock and key hypothesis and the induced fit hypothesis.,btohqsg
Suggest how does the yellow line come about on the graph? üòÑ,btohqsg
Ye saw alot on my insta,btohqsg
Been abit of a dry spell?,btohqsg
i feel like its unlikely to be pH,btohqsg
The yellow line reaches the same Vmax as the noncompetitive inhibitor.. could it be lower enzyme concentration ? idk üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
It is something that you never learn before.Green =Competitive inhibitorBlue =Noncompetitive inhibitorYellow = Uncompetitive inhibitor.This kind of inhibitor is quite rare. They have both reduced Kmax and Vmax. How they work is that they only bind after ESC is formed  preventing the release of products.,btohqsg
