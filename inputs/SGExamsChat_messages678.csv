I guess have to work hard yourself and ask for extra consults,btohqsg
Which section allows for that tho,btohqsg
i cant help u with that,btohqsg
Did yk that@chemcerchanged subj combi because of his class,btohqsg
But also if your teacher thinks or called you stupid it isn’t a good sign cos she may not be approachable,btohqsg
He originally took pcme but switch to cmeg,btohqsg
go yijc + nvr take a math or pure science and doing h2 math and h2 bio,btohqsg
cant wait for crimson on discord to call me an idiot lmfao,btohqsg
i alr ask how to do long division,btohqsg
Looks like it  tbh econs my fav subject in terms of the content (but not the easiest to score in exam),btohqsg
@lxrthshould i change subj to GHLm because of my classmate,btohqsg
then later he say u nvr take a math u go n do h2 math  stuoidor what?,btohqsg
u shld take subj tha y u like,btohqsg
When i said U in GP…,btohqsg
Yt took cmeg cause he didnt like his pcme class,btohqsg
If that’s the case right you must find other avenues of help,btohqsg
should i follow in his footsteps,btohqsg
See if got like some tuition centre that offer financial aid,btohqsg
Or find those free tuition from community initiatives,btohqsg
Meanwhile MJC on aircon after 9am,btohqsg
I dun hv math tuition so i dun really know of it helps beyond sch resources,btohqsg
Are you GP because all I want for christmas  is U,btohqsg
https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-division-long.htmlwtf is the video even showing,btohqsg
I'm supposed to do bio reading now but I'm using telegram 💀,btohqsg
Actually true sia  i rmb my batch this girl in Arts (A303)  she just keep vomiting out content  making new notes (like to test her memory la)  n i think she got 90 (or at least AAA/A),btohqsg
Also I haven't eaten since 7am AMA,btohqsg
In 2020  a 9-year-old girl suffered multiple fractures after she fell 4 storeys during a flying fox activity in primary school. Her carabiner had been attached to the zipline cable only via a cable tie  and the cable tie snapped once she was dispatched.For this incident  a former freelance instructor has been jailed:https://cna.asia/3SV7HrE,btohqsg
Yea idk how he bs sci  mostly facts…econs actually can,btohqsg
Yea i remembered spamming consult in econs  chem  phy…Meanwhile math i barely did anything  no consults and somehow A throughout  i actually dk HOW,btohqsg
I need math tuition cos like whenever I don’t know how to do a math question I need someone to help,btohqsg
Wot?? Eh this one hmmmm…i would not risk my grades becoz of my shit class (which is actually full of idiots),btohqsg
If not I get stuck for very long then I’m unproductive,btohqsg
You probably just got the aptitude for math,btohqsg
Maybe not math god level but just good enough,btohqsg
Like some can get A for math without doing much practise,btohqsg
Teach me leh  i want know how bs my mid-terms next week,btohqsg
Even if you don’t understand how long division works  just rmbr the steps. It gets very repetitive,btohqsg
And mr lim yew wei got shocked coz all i brought to consult was 10 school prelim papers,btohqsg
need to understand or elae how to do,btohqsg
Tbh my dad is my home tutor  idk HOW he remember his stuff,btohqsg
if i blindly remember i wikl not remember it for long,btohqsg
Just memorise how to do like me. A lot of stuff in h2 math I have no idea why it works that way so I have no choice but just to accept it and memorise the formulas,btohqsg
If you don’t understand it’s harder to rmbr how to do but eventually after spamming tons of questions you can do most of it,btohqsg
logarithm was so easy then idk what is this,btohqsg
I mean I also don’t understand why long division why I have to put stuff like the divisor outside,btohqsg
im. going home to cry later,btohqsg
But I rmbr what goes where,btohqsg
I just wanted that AAA/A that is why hahaha…so i had tons of other sch prelims for all subj except econs (i cant remember if i bot math),btohqsg
And what to multiply what with,btohqsg
tell my vj friend to call me stupid later,btohqsg
bro fr just accepted she is a lost cause,btohqsg
Good actually i regretted taking h3 math  waste of time staying back late after sch nd all that proving…,btohqsg
he ltr will call me stupid one,btohqsg
bc i just asked a qn there,btohqsg
I didnt  coz it is fun to just listen but exam is NOT fun  i think almost the whole paper was blank,btohqsg
😂😂😂😂 i agree w u man,btohqsg
But i was only offered math,btohqsg
I thought h3 geog would be the easiest to get distinction since it’s a research paper then can just bs random stuff,btohqsg
I may hv taken h3 chem if i got offered,btohqsg
But my chem only was high lvl in j2,btohqsg
The grade boundaries for h3 math are very low,btohqsg
Coz i ended up like focusing on my H2 H1,btohqsg
Which subj do yall feel is hardest,btohqsg
Coz i really actually wanted that 4 As,btohqsg
My friend who took h3 math said he thinks he got around 50-60% but still got distinction,btohqsg
I actually dk coz i mug to the grades,btohqsg
Maybe 55 is alr distinction for h3 math,btohqsg
Idk if this is an simpler explanation for long division,btohqsg
So the paper was easy not becoz im smart  it is because of all the grinding lmao,btohqsg
WAH but i mean it is expected,btohqsg
20% for h3 math is probably merit,btohqsg
Sekali pass for h3 math is like just 25%,btohqsg
the only h3 subject with similar grade boundaries to llike a normal h2 subject is like,btohqsg
cuz h3 physics is uniornically just h2 physics + more math,btohqsg
acc to most of my frens,btohqsg
I thought that would be pass,btohqsg
I wished i was smarter in chem in j1,btohqsg
Then i can take h3 chem,btohqsg
lol man prob saw it online then tot y not?,btohqsg
But h3 math is super super dry,btohqsg
Maybe distinction is not even 50%,btohqsg
There’s a 4 above and below,btohqsg
its the same as 4 divide 4,btohqsg
very stupid like what crimson said,btohqsg
If u wanna do abit longer  its 16 divided by 4 which is 4,btohqsg
is quotient tge on top thing,btohqsg
Try relate this to the simpler one previous,btohqsg
then the beside thr thing is dividend,btohqsg
but idk how to do for fraction,btohqsg
what is ny friend eveb writing,btohqsg
i only know the x square minus 2x,btohqsg
idk where she get the 4 from,btohqsg
wtf is that supposed to mean lol,btohqsg
but where did the 4 even come from,btohqsg
U must think of a number that can multiply,btohqsg
In order to get rid of the remainders until the simplest form,btohqsg
but thr 4 come frol where,btohqsg
Just take ur time to read this,btohqsg
i dont hv the amath tb,btohqsg
Just read steps 3 and 4,btohqsg
The previous steps might confuse u,btohqsg
no its not abt him calling u stupid,btohqsg
its just the other things he say,btohqsg
these kinds of long division idek how to do,btohqsg
sounds like a jock boy with no brain,btohqsg
i should have not taken h2 math,btohqsg
is he better than josh? yes,btohqsg
idek how to do a math,btohqsg
i agree dude what u mean,btohqsg
know how to talk to people,btohqsg
yes u should not have taken h2 math cuz u keep saying u should not have taken it,btohqsg
no one forcing u to take it,btohqsg
then change ur h1 to h2,btohqsg
u said im a lost cause,btohqsg
cause u dont wanna do anythin,btohqsg
he thinks his height represents his ego,btohqsg
who cares if ur 191 🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
U are the one literally convincing urself u are stupid,btohqsg
for long division do u guys know how this person got 2x + 1 on top,btohqsg
but its another thing if udk and udw ask,btohqsg
bro i alr answered Ur qn,btohqsg
Yeah sometimes mindset is quite important,btohqsg
If u think u cannot then it’s hard,btohqsg
where did negative 4 come from,btohqsg
idk how to do that dude,btohqsg
so he is those type that will tell everyone he 191 one la,btohqsg
even he die also on the grave must put 191cm,btohqsg
u basically want to get rid of the highest power,btohqsg
my parents dont hv money they spend a lot on imh and braces for me already,btohqsg
theg say they got no more money,btohqsg
cuz she wants to convince us shes stupid,btohqsg
what multiplied by 3x gets 6x^2?,btohqsg
but u keep following it with,btohqsg
"""My VJC friend says im stupid""",btohqsg
i can brag that im short la,btohqsg
idek where she get the negative 4 from,btohqsg
the negative 4 is the remainder,btohqsg
sometimes dont panic  just sit down and stare at it,btohqsg
i literallt stared at it in class for 1h,btohqsg
the -4 is cos x times -4 is -4x,btohqsg
and i couldnt understand what my friend is writing,btohqsg
you wanna get rid of the -4x,btohqsg
ik the x square + 2x one,btohqsg
but idk where she get the negative 4 from,btohqsg
its just what he wrote  he wants to get rid of the (-4x-3),btohqsg
you wanna get rid of the coefficient of the highest degree,btohqsg
so let's say you wanna divide x²+x+2 over x-2,btohqsg
get rid of the x² first,btohqsg
but get rid of it already what,btohqsg
Ok forget about what ur friend put. How would u get rid of the -4x in remainder? Like what numberX(x+2) to simplify the remainder more,btohqsg
you're supposed to get rid of the x now,btohqsg
because times x to both x and 2,btohqsg
ok correctionyou want to get rid of anything thats greater or equal to the highest polynomial of the denominator,btohqsg
I want the -4x-3 to be gone also,btohqsg
Let's denote the highest degree of the denominator as H  and the highest degree of numerator as J  we want to make sure that long division helps to simplify the fraction  such that J < H,btohqsg
Ok then u see u still left with -4x-3 right?,btohqsg
if J >= H <=> improper fraction,btohqsg
U have found the one who resulted in 1.3k messages,btohqsg
get rid of the -4x now,btohqsg
How to get rid of the -4x?,btohqsg
Repeat the process again like how u get rid of xsquare,btohqsg
If u know the previous step u can do the second step,btohqsg
its kinda a recursion until highest degree of polynomial is lower,btohqsg
Wait r u just asking why need to divide again,btohqsg
yeah  until the dividend has a lower degree than the thing you're doing with,btohqsg
IDK HOW TO DO LONY DIVISION,btohqsg
Wah this is why we don't need more children in the world,btohqsg
WHY N6 FRIEND WRITE NEGATIVE 4,btohqsg
you have x+3but you are diving with x²then cannot divide further alr,btohqsg
lol n u still dont agree that im stupid,btohqsg
-4 times x+2 u get what?,btohqsg
you're not stupid you just need help,btohqsg
im sorry florals idw to be mean but theres a limit,btohqsg
where she get the negative 4 on top,btohqsg
bruh my bus the aircorn. is hot air cmg out,btohqsg
Then u can get rid of the 4x in the remainder liao mah,btohqsg
Then u get a number as remainder,btohqsg
That’s the simplest form for remainder liao,btohqsg
bro even the bus is sweating,btohqsg
why got beg tive 4 on top,btohqsg
U see why there's 1.3k messages,btohqsg
"Any attempt at helping she follows up with ""I'm stupid""",btohqsg
Not u creating a sticker of what vem says,btohqsg
just dont write inside the equation,btohqsg
there's a reason i left to do my own work lol,btohqsg
like i understand the first one  then - 4x - 3 that one ik bc -2x minus 2x,btohqsg
Yea u must get rid of X in the remainder,btohqsg
So just repeat the process to long divide again(like how u get rid of Xsquare,btohqsg
then she just write the times 4 for - 3 ah,btohqsg
Then u removed the -4x already,btohqsg
I actually dk what the 0/1/3 is,btohqsg
pls no. i tried b4 and chat gpt give wrong answer,btohqsg
i think is best u ask ur cher or smtg,btohqsg
idk who my math cher is,btohqsg
i asked a yijcian but he nvr answer,btohqsg
sigh  bro doesn't understand long division,btohqsg
florals gl in learning binomial theorem,btohqsg
I can do the qns at home but rn im walking,btohqsg
i askijg my parents n teachers,btohqsg
then u guys say uw to kill urself. or something,btohqsg
i think today is my 13th reason,btohqsg
89.99rpers whenever they never get 90rp,btohqsg
redox is love redox is life,btohqsg
how to get rid of - 4x - 3,btohqsg
its not conducive to say this when ppl are trying to help younotonly does it limit your own progress  it also waste other people's time since you arent making effort to understand,btohqsg
just focus on removing the -4x@lxrthdon't forget about removing everything,btohqsg

let's say you have reminder 5 when diving by 3x-5,btohqsg
my brain cells changed from negative to infinity,btohqsg
then still got - 3 what,btohqsg
Differentiation and Integration I do not like,btohqsg
now try teaching florals about differentiation and integration,btohqsg
differentiation also can be used to find rate of change,btohqsg
fuqqqq i always eat mac lol,btohqsg
no other decent food/can study place with ac,btohqsg
though i like studying in sch libs,btohqsg
usually go mac cus school ends at 3 and my class starts at 6:30,btohqsg
so inconventient to go anywhr far,btohqsg
i was thinking anderson sec 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
i want to go anderson jc lol  not im at anderson sec,btohqsg
if no class i wld go nex or smth,btohqsg
if i dont slak and say too tired lol,btohqsg
why was this recommended to me earlier as a BCM student,btohqsg
theres is a place with free food but u need book first. and is at bukit timah,btohqsg
Y3 me wanted to take bfmh 💀,btohqsg
Are you that conflicted to think straight or wot lol idw assume otherwise but u do know there's a difference between idw and idkAre u the overlap between ( idw U idk)  cause if thats the case then  that one is rlly u needa figure out shit yourself,btohqsg
if no contrasting subj then i wld take bcfm,btohqsg
if my school offered ki and it could still replace gp i would take ki,btohqsg
tho alot of times i dont cause fatigue af lpl,btohqsg
thers a few places in sg like this.,btohqsg
tho hopefully term 2 not as much,btohqsg
btw any1 got tips for SJPO  physics junior olympiad,btohqsg
got 3 months gonna grind fr,btohqsg
Also I'm sure you're very new so as a long-time  member of the chat   imma remind u,btohqsg
bc idr alr from when i did sjpo,btohqsg
angular momentum  rotational KE  moment of inertia those are uni or H3 ig,btohqsg
i’m basing off the doc he sent ah,btohqsg
Speaking of h3   I browsed thru the h3 phy notes like nth much leh,btohqsg
H3 dont teach fluid dynamics i think,btohqsg
Also more chim description and usage of words,btohqsg
might ask my cher for updated 1 if he have ig,btohqsg
how in depth should i study?,btohqsg
everything is an extension of H2 so you don’t just deal with point like particles in mechanics,btohqsg
you use keplers laws more in gravitation iirc,btohqsg
I just rmb blanking from that lecture from mechanics,btohqsg
ellipse  dA/dt  period relation to axes,btohqsg
but ya if you have a solid understanding conceptually of H2,btohqsg
Ngl mine is kinda weak ISH but I think it's doable if I grind here and there to sharpen and strengthen my undst,btohqsg
wait siyan u took h3 phys,btohqsg
emphasis on conceptually bc you need to be able to translate the physics to the math,btohqsg
Shhh you aint done uni mechanics,btohqsg
no but i tutored it before,btohqsg
"Like I look at it and went "" hey it's not that deep!""",btohqsg
so i guess study h2 notes for spjo?,btohqsg
If I were to take phy in uni I'd die then and there,btohqsg
would be a good start or look up the textbook by young and freedman,btohqsg
uni textbook but it’s a bible,btohqsg
It's my last resort if any,btohqsg
I rather die in comp sci if I'm eligible for it,btohqsg
Thats what i said when i was y3 in mi fr,btohqsg
I told my friend i rather study chinese than physics in uni,btohqsg
Wait. Why did you choose phy?!,btohqsg
so many dumb ways to die,btohqsg
Of all the reasons to choose bro chose the most basic one,btohqsg
Okie nvm mbad I self-contradicted myself,btohqsg
So many ways to die and i chose the dumbest one,btohqsg
And now i ask myself why am i crying every night,btohqsg
At least you did not die in proving epsilon deltas in maths,btohqsg
I would be grateful to even understand what are epsilon deltas,btohqsg
They are symbolised by the letter e,btohqsg
But like they are not e,btohqsg
I long time dont like mcvriddles for their maple syrupness,btohqsg
As a mcmuffin lover  I find mcgriddles an offense,btohqsg
i'm a fan of sweet and savoury,btohqsg
so mcgriddles is right up my alley,btohqsg
Muffin + maple syrup = mcgriddleMcgriddle + maple syrup =/= mcmuffin.Thus  mcmuffin is superior (QED),btohqsg
time does not wait for me 😔,btohqsg
Our natural instincts are to protect the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us. What’s happened to the human soul?In a Facebook post  former president Halimah Yacob called for the world to “stand on the side of humanity”  questioning the morality of the ongoing situation in Gaza as the Palestinian death toll reaches almost 30 000.https://str.sg/8vKZ,btohqsg
Bro has NOT experienced the real J2 horror,btohqsg
we actually dun hv pre-reads last time  i just study  i dun read ahead lol,btohqsg
he ask me is xxx tested,btohqsg
i just know what he also know,btohqsg
and also  he is a RI 90rp + H3 chem distinction person that come tell me he has no memory retention and memory very bad...,btohqsg
and when i asked him how he 90rp like that  he be saying 'A level is so trivial  u understand and u can score well already',btohqsg
MAH GAWD IS THAT YOUR BIRDY,btohqsg
At least it can't shit on your forearm,btohqsg
isn't it common in the wild,btohqsg
Yea but bro got it to be TAMED,btohqsg
How often do u see these kind of birds TAMED,btohqsg
BUT YEAH IT'S RETARDED IT BITES ME 24/7,btohqsg
💀💀💀💀 didn't u train it not to bite,btohqsg
or did it just decided to assert dominance,btohqsg
Okie but fr I hear it's hard being bird keepers cause uk at some point you gotta take note of it's feathers and trim??,btohqsg
Like let's say you lz dw take it to the vet and stuff uk,btohqsg
some ppl accidentally cut the blood feathers which is indeed ggwp,btohqsg
I thought of owning one regardless of it's origin but birds kinda abit high maintenance flying dinosaurs,btohqsg
Uh tbh just need take care of its nails can already,btohqsg
it will change feathers after some time,btohqsg
uh that's a very GOOD qn,btohqsg
Man I see ppl who have hunting birds rite  they train their birdies to catch preys and pest birds,btohqsg
like sniper but tamed and live sniper,btohqsg
Unless it doesn't know that it can fly away then  🤡🤡,btohqsg
Wah lucky Ur bird no skin condition uk,btohqsg
the coat is very smooth and shiny,btohqsg
His been with me since after he hatch lol,btohqsg
That's a freaking hawk or eagle,btohqsg
Wah so when it was a fledgling  it would make a lot of noise and follow u ard finding food?,btohqsg
Aren't you glad your neighbours didn't file a noise complaint against yall,btohqsg
HAHAHA see that's why after 10pm I off the lights,btohqsg
How do u get it to diam,btohqsg
And he just shut up immediately,btohqsg
Oh do you make it hunt for live insects too,btohqsg
I mean it is night time but yeah once u off the light he stop,btohqsg
Does it know how to lol,btohqsg
So ig idk it's used to you feeding it now HAHA,btohqsg
Gg those kinds are a bit hard to release back into the wild cause it won't know how to find food on its own and it'll die leh🤡🗿🗿🗿,btohqsg
Oh how do u know it's gender,btohqsg
Actually it's a she not a he,btohqsg
It'll be funnier even she understands wtv comes out of your mouth uk,btohqsg
not commands but more like u talk to her ukuk,btohqsg
There’s an actual bird nest in my house,btohqsg
@chemcerwas this what u wished for,btohqsg
All i want for christmas is...,btohqsg
Wah im seeing this for the 100th time this month,btohqsg
actually some ppl in my class has the real this,btohqsg
No way u ended up in the better LT w that,btohqsg
Created on word doc or sth,btohqsg
Btw i think the real cert dun hv subject code there and the H1/H2 is in a separate💀💀💀,btohqsg
We're not disregarding your shit results,btohqsg
but imagine if nobody replied to him,btohqsg
I did sth but i dunno if i actually retained any info,btohqsg
sorry i thought you didnt know me because your amath ass was too superior to talk to dnt kids,btohqsg
Yes i was unfortunate to have to do it for Ns and Os,btohqsg
I actually failed my sec 2 dnt theory test lmao,btohqsg
I remember you were from the other class ok... my class were the amath rejects remainings,btohqsg
Meanwhile my sch actually forces everyone to take A math and u can only drop it in sec 4 even if u are getting f9 or shit,btohqsg
Shit shouldve gone to your secondary school,btohqsg
Actually my sch got ppl ended up w 6 subjects only,btohqsg
Eh CB why you didn't come back for cny!,btohqsg
I went from 0 a math to h2 math and i was crying everyday,btohqsg
Comb sci and dropped A math,btohqsg
lestin  the one you should rlly cry for is H2 Phys,btohqsg
Yea the steep curve…i think the bridging barely helped,btohqsg
I got 1/25 for my first complex number test,btohqsg
I think it is to ensure ppl hv a safety net  like if not 6 subj need count all 6 GG sia.,btohqsg
And yes during my year h2 math first topic was complex numbers,btohqsg
But actually one of my friendE math fr D7 to A1 and A math from F9 to A2 (prelims to os),btohqsg
Seeing h2 phy stuff in the other gc  im happy i took H1,btohqsg
You know... my form teacher laughed at me when i said i wanted to do A levels because my prelim grades were all C6,btohqsg
My physics was a whole miracle,btohqsg
most jcs dont offer h2 bio w/o chem,btohqsg
H2 physics do be fun though,btohqsg
C5 throughout sec 3-4  magically pulled a A2 in Os and doing well in JC,btohqsg
But yeah i gets why people dont wanna do it,btohqsg
My physics journey in sec sch pushed me to h1 (which is somehow easier than os),btohqsg
It is coz it is compulsory,btohqsg
Like if u take H2 bio  h2 chem is comoulsory,btohqsg
I thought there was the rare phy bio combi you could do,btohqsg
No wonder you topped our school....,btohqsg
Oh really? I read that h2 chem is compulsory w h2 bio,btohqsg
The last time i got 90% for a subject is in sec 3 math ca1,btohqsg
I actually didnt know there is h1 math in sci combi,btohqsg
lol ik quite a few BCmE ppl,btohqsg
My A1 not even that high sia,btohqsg
Idk why would they do that:-(,btohqsg
Why u dw take pure sci,btohqsg
its not moe requirement but most schools wont allow h2 bio without h2 chem because h2 bio alone isnt really needed for any uni courses and alot of the concepts in h2 bio are related to h2 chem,btohqsg
Then combine sci to h2 sci is a super big jump,btohqsg
I rmb they had to take bridging lessons or smyh,btohqsg
Wtf why TM now got all these weird fuck combis,btohqsg
Btw dun mind me asking how does the n lvl grading like to qualify to jc,btohqsg
