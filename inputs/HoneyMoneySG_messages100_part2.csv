I see DBS is $45k SCB is $60k.,btohqsg
they may not mean what they say... oops.. hahha,btohqsg
Maybe can opt for the 10k fixed deposit method first?Have you taken any loans with any banks/licensed moneylender in Singapore?,btohqsg
My nationality is Myanmar My income is more than their requirements 40K My salary also credited to my UOB one account The reason I trying to apply CC is to get cash back rewards from my monthly spending ,btohqsg
No I don‚Äôt have any loan from moneylender I tried talk to UOB counters but they don‚Äôt give me any idea and answer,btohqsg
Oh I mean to use pay bill  where I can charge to dbs cc,btohqsg
Ok  Singapore Government requires Income to be minimum $30k before credit card can be granted.It is up to the individual banks to follow this minimum or decide to adopt a more conservative stance and have internal requirement of say $40k or $60k for foreigners.From my interaction with UOB  even though they state $40k  I do not mean it as a joke when I say they may not mean it. Internally  they could really require $50k as an example.You could try doing the $10k secured deposit method FIRST to get a card... show some credit card repayment track record then request to convert to Unsecured (normal) credit card.,btohqsg
Have you updated your income on UOB internet banking website to your latest income before applying?,btohqsg
Hello  I want to know about the VOO tax imposed? Anyone can help to explain? Does it means it will tax my gain?,btohqsg
I see   I‚Äôll try this way I don‚Äôt know why the bank staffs didn‚Äôt explain anything ,btohqsg
i received my uob one CC yesterday   will the statement end on the 12th? or next month 12th?,btohqsg
usually bank staff need to be very cautious with their replies as they would be held to it.so they will usually say don't know or pretend not to know..especially when not their department (credit risk decision),btohqsg
You can use UOB chat assist to chat with the CSO to find out the statement date.,btohqsg
okay so after talking with CSO  the default date is 12th  which will be for all your cards so in my case i activated it on  5/4  will be getting first statement on the 12/4 . So best is to change the statement date   which changing statement date will be applicable to ALL uob cardsHopefully this helps someone  uob first statement,btohqsg
Are we able to salary credit by ourselves for OCBC360 to qualify for the additional interest?,btohqsg
If so  how do you usually do it?,btohqsg
Hi need some help here on UOB Ladies Solitare Card. My statement cycle is mid month to mid month. From 1 April  I changed one of my bonus category from Family to Travel. From 1 April they also capped the spend bonus amount from 3k to 2k.Q1. My current cycle from mid March to mid April spending bonus cap is 3k or 2k or other pro-rated number?Q2. On 1 April will my bonus category change to Travel in the middle of my current statement cycle?,btohqsg
no. only corporate salary will qualify.,btohqsg
UOB sol cycle is monthly not statement month. Ur spending from mid march to end march is under 3k limit. Start April to mid April will be under 2k limit.,btohqsg
lady card bonus points cap/category is based on calendar month,btohqsg

Singapore does not have a tax treaty with the US. As a result  Singapore investors are taxed a 30% withholding tax on dividends from US-listed securities (including ETFs and unit trusts). This applies whether you buy these securities through a broker  fund platform or robo-advisor.,btohqsg

Oh i didnt noticeüòÖ only saw SGQR,btohqsg
nvm i read wrongly   i thought he was talking about personal xnap qr code,btohqsg
Well the scam might also hit personal XNAP QR codes.,btohqsg
Unlikely just due to nationality as poster working in sg for a while. Maybe more to do with credit score/past conduct of account/ other reasons not shared fully here.,btohqsg
Certain nationality need special approval regardless how long they work in sg for finance product. It is not as simple as u think  like sanction etc,btohqsg
Hi I wish to check about this. When the UOB one card say cashback about simplyGO  is topping up my ez link the same thing or a different thing,btohqsg
U have to tap ur phone on the reader cannot topup,btohqsg
The normal Burmese on the street is not subject to sanctions  (sg also doesn‚Äôt impose sanctions on myanmar) what‚Äôs more those who is making a normal living in sg,btohqsg
So is that any credit card is the market that offer cashback or reward point when topping up ezlink card,btohqsg
I just saying etc  there is alot of consideration when giving cc approval  let alone foreigner and then foreigner from certain country,btohqsg
There's a great tool calledheymax.aiyou can use to check for the best card for a certain type of transaction.,btohqsg
"if users use the card for payment in any other currency (""target currency"")  your base currency (SGD) will be converted to the target currency at the mid-market rate  incurring a small exchange fee. The fee will depend on the desired target currency. If your base currency is insufficient  the next available currency will be selected.",btohqsg
