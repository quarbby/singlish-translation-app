Sembcorp may reward investors with special dividend for FY2022 as H1 profit outperformsSembcorp’s net profit shot up to S$490 million for the half-year period from S$46 million a year ago  thanks to higher electricity prices in Singapore and India.https://bt.sg/UCvY,btohqsg
first is on their vessel ownership and chartering. Extracted from their annual report in which they own a stake in a company that owns a Supramax carrier which is a clear beneficiary of the high demand  depicted by below chart,btohqsg
As of their full year result  the index has more than doubled and not looking to go down in foreseeable future,btohqsg
they have made advances to GHD (dry bulk associate) and provisioned for loss allowances.with the BDI recovery  in all likelihood this provision can be reversed and most importantly the $3.2m advance is likely to be collected.big money for a $17m market cap company (assuming full rights subscription),btohqsg
Secondly on their property development segmentThey are in China and Thailand for this segment. In china they own a 36.6% stake in an associate company which is developing a project in Dalian. Phase 7 was completed and waiting for remaining units to be absorbed by market. They have no existing development activities there now which is a good sign. The cash needs/burn has stopped and just waiting for remaining to be sold. If market recovers they will commence new phases. This shows prudencyFor thailand side is a 30% stake in a company that operates office and commercial building in BangkokEspecially for the Thailand side it looks easily monetised if cash need ever comes up (hence i guessed above that they are in no risk of default  especially just being newly capitalised in latest rights issue. Solvency is ensured),btohqsg
