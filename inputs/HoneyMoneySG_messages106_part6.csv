Ahh  I received multiple yield of Singapore cash coupon from moomoo after subscribe into the cash fund. Was wonder the cash coupon that I received is part of the 6.8% return? Or only the daily return from cash fund are counted as part of 6.8% return..,btohqsg
Different items  $2 coupon daily is part of KOL bonus. 6.8% is made up of daily fund returns (3.x%) and moomoo top-up (end of promo period),btohqsg
Does anyone know where can we get a quote for insurance policies?  In the past  MoneyOwl was providing such services.,btohqsg

Sry  the Everyday+ Rewards is a separate programme to the HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo right? They are not related to one another  just that they both give bonus interest to HSBC EGA (but with different reference months).My question is even if I don't SMS and register for the bonus interest promo  but fulfill the 2 criteria of transferring in $2k and transact 5 times  I'm still eligible for the 1% rebate for giro bill payments.,btohqsg
Daily and balance of 6.8% will pay end of the event by cash coupon,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôm currently paying $400 plus per month to prudential insurance.I‚Äôve checked their payment portal  they only accept master & visa  and don‚Äôt accept Amex.May I ask  if there‚Äôs any card I can use to pay this $400+ per month and I can still earn cash back / points etc using Visa / masters?,btohqsg
not many insurance accept Amex card though,btohqsg
Maybank Platinum Visa for up to 50% of spending tier,btohqsg
Thank you. I‚Äôll check out this card. üôè,btohqsg
I found it. Thanks so much. If I clock for $300 tiers  I‚Äôll still need to spend $150 on that card on other items?So if I choose $1000 tiers  I‚Äôll need to spend $600 if my insurance is $400 per month?,btohqsg
Yes. For your case  to make most out of it would be to spend around $600 per month on $1000 tier.,btohqsg
Ok thank you very much. I‚Äôll go check on the application if got any deals.,btohqsg
See if it makes more sense or would just getting cashback from other cards would be better and just getting 1% from HSBC EGA is better.,btohqsg
Maybank platinum can use for utility and travel insurance etc to make up the 1k monthly,btohqsg
