u try to find cheaper shop ba,btohqsg
Disconnect it and leave it opened if u dun need the folding function,btohqsg
Must fix no choice then  at max can get cheaper shop.,btohqsg
Most carsüòÖ I never owned a Mazda but it happened to mine,btohqsg
for now i dont fold  but since i sometimes park at tight spaces  i sked people hit it,btohqsg
Yeah  sometimes if you practice protective parking  need to fold to be able to open the door a bit more to get out easily,btohqsg
Lucky you go ask Ur Mother. See if can help.,btohqsg
okay will try to help Ur mother  will search online.,btohqsg
Why ur nick and is like this?,btohqsg
ohh no la just for jokes ah,btohqsg
No problem at all even if it‚Äôs a common failure. Doesn‚Äôt mean for a sec that it is an unreliable car. üëçüèº,btohqsg
nah nah  not saying its unreliable ah  i just abit ocd,btohqsg
its just buggin me that the one side cnt fold,btohqsg
I am helping Ur mother not you,btohqsg
@Jingxunnpls help Ur Mother. Not me.,btohqsg
Yeah  will look very odd too.,btohqsg
understood  not helping you. just Ur mother.,btohqsg
No he means help Ur mother,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a known common issue for the 6. I think it‚Äôs some plastic component giving way over time,btohqsg
wont exactly say jammed all the time   it just it cannot fold fully or open fully,btohqsg
Need to push a bit for the whole movement to complete right?,btohqsg
yeaa the workshop i went to ask says that but idk whether plastic anot,btohqsg
I want to help Ur Mother too.,btohqsg
no need  i help Ur mother can already :),btohqsg
like uk the switch to open and close? if stuck right  i constantly switch off and on to open the mirror HAHHAHAHHA,btohqsg
Make sure there is no foreign object which is causing obstruction in its full movement range.,btohqsg
Some complain of the mirrors constantly trying to fold even after it has folded  just keeps clicking non stop,btohqsg
Is that Toyota Altis promo good? Looking at Corolla Altis now. Also considering Mazda 3 Elegance variant .,btohqsg
Ah yes  when the workshop opens the mirror assembly  check for something stuck first before replacing with new part,btohqsg
idt there is a fod there but imma checkk,btohqsg
If it can stay and you want to save on the repairs  you can just leave it opened permanently. If it‚Äôs having issues of constantly folding or opening then will need to get it replaced. I had a friend that maintains it by spray WD40 every once in awhile but I don‚Äôt know how effective it really is,btohqsg
if you are the drive A to B type of person  go for the altis. if you are a guy who likes to drive  then the mazda is for u! but right  the 1.5 litre engine abit underwhelmingg,btohqsg
I would recommend the Mazda 3 if you're looking for some extra tech as well. Point A to B  simple no nonsense requirement  can go for Altis directly!,btohqsg
i saw one guy on yt he also use the WD40 method  i wanna try but idk if will make it worse or anot  so imma just seek advice firstt HAHA,btohqsg
Wah first time you‚Äôre agreeing with Ur Mother.,btohqsg
Thank you Mr Anwo  it's very easy to agree with Ur Mother actually  makes good points,btohqsg
That would be my first guess too,btohqsg
I want to talk more with Ur Mother,btohqsg
Why u want to let pple make fun of your mother?,btohqsg
I haven't checked Mazda 3 price  but if comparing the Altis promo price vs SGCarmart price for M3  Altis is cheaper,btohqsg
Today is Love Ur Mother Day.,btohqsg
"no broo  cos i still studying in poly. so if like my teammates need to get my tele name to msg ah  i can say simply reply ""ur mother"". the reaction funny broo AHAHHAHA",btohqsg
wah surprising cos i thought sg have toyota tax too. i think the M3 is a better buy if you are willing to stretch your budget because the tech and material feel is better  in my opinion.,btohqsg
I suggest all should listen to Ur Mother.,btohqsg
Mazda can negotiate a bit  even when there is no offer  they are open to negotiate. Have a few friends who got elegance trims at the price of the classic,btohqsg
U poly student‚Ä¶ the car got your biz??? If your mother so rich and good to buy u Mazda‚Ä¶ u put hour mother here for pple to makeFun of???,btohqsg
car guys all very serious oneü§£ü§£,btohqsg
i just want joke abittt üò©,btohqsg
okok relax haha  not ur mother no worries,btohqsg
I think most mothers are really good and selfless for children ‚Ä¶ joke about some chicks lah,btohqsg
