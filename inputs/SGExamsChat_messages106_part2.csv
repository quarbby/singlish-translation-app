Tryna understand the nature and beauty  of this universe,btohqsg
This person has not read the statistical mechanics book,btohqsg
Is this where fractals come in?,btohqsg
The very reason we are here to observe the universe is that the universe wants to kill itself and we are a byproduct of that.,btohqsg
Hmm vet  I think that's probably not saturated but you start your own practice to earn money ah?,btohqsg
The moment u start worrying about money ur gonna fuck up. Scarcity mindset. Ur chasing the chicken and not getting the chicken to lay eggsðŸ˜Œ ok la enough said. Think positive guys  u can do it ðŸ™Œ,btohqsg
U have become what u hate,btohqsg
Sadly the only way to not worry about money is either aid or having money in the first place,btohqsg
Talk about scarcity and Matthew effect but using it as a tool for condescension,btohqsg
Eh not a long exposition just a quick mention,btohqsg
Why you guys so scared of salary talk lol,btohqsg
It's not about salary it's about money and capital,btohqsg
And more vaguely how to deploy them in useful ways,btohqsg
Don't be blinded by money. I lost my parents to money.,btohqsg
The Matthew effect does not trap you if you want to be socially mobile. My parents came from very humble backgrounds and then start to be so focused on money,btohqsg
Oh btw  if you happen to look at the works of the latest econs Nobel laureate  you will notice that even the richest of the rich  when put in shit conditions  have no resources nor time to overcome the scarcity. Matthew effect isn't that easily overcome by a simple (don't have a scarcity based mindset),btohqsg
Many people including relatives and scholarship providers I know have worked their way up slowly... you need patience and not keep whining,btohqsg
Telling people not to be blinded by money is as effective as telling NRA to stop using guns,btohqsg
U gave me one example and expect to overcome the global problem,btohqsg
I left hwz cause it was full of trash talk about how poor ppl are and all the whining. Guys look at the bright side. We can do it!,btohqsg
We talk about population stats here  not individual victories,btohqsg
Bright side doesn't do shit for alot of ppl,btohqsg
It's like telling the depressed there's nothing to be depressed abt,btohqsg
Many of my relatives have ended up cushy jobs. Just work hard and be fiery with passion. That's the best advice I can give...,btohqsg
Prediction: you will leave here very soon.,btohqsg
Or telling the autistic kid to speak up,btohqsg
Sigh.  Nothing u can do to help learned helplessness,btohqsg
U haven't been pushed into the deep end of the pool,btohqsg
I expected more from a cambridge dude ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
Î”S (Universe) = Î”S(System)Â + S (Surroundings)you probably seen the kym threads too,btohqsg
Lol Cambridge isn't a magical wand.,btohqsg
Ah girl sorry hor me from a shit bg and ended up where I am precisely because I am Galactically lucky and pure effort,btohqsg
None of the elite universities are a magical wand,btohqsg
To put things into perspective getting into oxbridge medicine needs you to have 3.9/4.0 GPA,btohqsg
Being privileged doesn't mean I don't acknowledge the effect of luck,btohqsg
And Oxbridge medicine too  isn't worth very much,btohqsg
I don't really think u understand what's needed for Oxbridge,btohqsg
Most competitive uni and most competitive course xd xd,btohqsg
just do your work. Do not be silent. Learn how to communicate and convince people and say your truth. I believe you can do well in life.,btohqsg
Whether or not I do well has nothing to do ur belief,btohqsg
I don't think you are in a place to give me advise honestly,btohqsg
That said  I know people from finance  law and medicine who are doing very well  in my extended family...  the numbers are just numbers.  They represent the mean or the average. Are you average???,btohqsg
I need to break into Administrative Service/s,btohqsg
I'm confused about where this Convo is leading,btohqsg
My dream since young was to help the population of Singapore by entering the elite Administrative Service to bring coordination within the government. Oh and/s,btohqsg
The convo is leading to the fact of social mobility which our government firmly believes is a political and societal truth.,btohqsg
You will be counselled to leave CEP too Low for your age sadlyfe,btohqsg
U obviously haven't read Ong Ye Kung speech,btohqsg
From 2 room hdb to landed.  Bs???,btohqsg
Maybe last time property prices cheaper,btohqsg
