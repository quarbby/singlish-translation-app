eh he realised it's not for him,btohqsg
chill man I am tired of memorising dna replication like 30 times,btohqsg
Wait  no I’m not enabling his procrastination,btohqsg
I’m sure that some people do.,btohqsg
you are draining my life force,btohqsg
you don't need to give evidence that people like you...,btohqsg
Its literally just deoxyribonucleic acid with four bases of adenine  thymine  guanine and cytosine in a sequence of nucleotides.,btohqsg
are you taking your A levels  good luck,btohqsg
Yeah  see  I’m not even a biology student  and I know that.,btohqsg
Along with the fact that you’re already pretty burnt from the roasting?,btohqsg
i dropped bio after sec 2,btohqsg
i just finished my assignment anyone wanna play league btw,btohqsg
I do not chill. Chilling? What’s that like? Either way  go study.,btohqsg
Its the transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of deoxyribonucleic acid using deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferases  also known as DNMTs.,btohqsg
All the best with yours. What’s it in  though?,btohqsg
I can’t believe that I’ve to mansplain a biology term to a boy.,btohqsg
Oh  do you know Professor Alfred Lim Wee Chung then?,btohqsg
Step two — don’t ever dare question the judgement and what your future wife tells you  because its supposedly known that she is never wrong  k?,btohqsg
Its getting kinda sad to watch.,btohqsg
I’m not doing that whole helping you study thing. That’s what your biology textbook is for. Are you even taking notes?,btohqsg
stomp on his corpse  why don't ya,btohqsg
I would’ve said that first  if I wasn’t busy having a mental breakdown about having being asked this question in the first place. So  thank you for taking one for the team Kuro.,btohqsg
Is that him fighting back? Because I’d love to give him an award for not even putting in sufficient enough valiant efforts as a consolation prize here.,btohqsg
haha I am still here you know,btohqsg
a lone warrior against the forces of evil,btohqsg
I’d much rather kill him with success and tag him with a smile. A more worthy way of spending my time  don’t you think?,btohqsg
He's gonna have zero success at this rate,btohqsg
I just need a B for my classes,btohqsg
so at least it's not that bad,btohqsg
Oh  you think that we’re friends? That’s adorable. You’re not even remotely close to being any where near enough to be considered my competition.,btohqsg
I was about to say that,btohqsg
Is a movie title  but you should go study so you’d know that fact at the very least.,btohqsg
i wldnt say its well known,btohqsg
That’s unfortunate. His published research paper on nanotechnology is a revolutionarily life-changing  which must be read.,btohqsg
If you want to send it to me  I don't mind taking a look after my finals.,btohqsg
Granted I've got a ton of other readings to do.,btohqsg
Its not that old. Its literally just younger than the other various coming of age classic teenage movies.,btohqsg
If I’m not wrong  you could find it online if you searched his full name up.,btohqsg
I found one from the NTU archive,btohqsg
Alright I'll bookmark it for now,btohqsg
CoOl. All the best for finals.,btohqsg
@VoidchordsAlso  we shouldn’t talk to Joel until after he studies to avoid him finding a reason to procrastinate.,btohqsg
Speaking of which  if you’re reading this Joel  go study.,btohqsg
Kiss your biology textbook’s ass and suck up to that instead please.,btohqsg
also coming of age movies arent that popular in general,btohqsg
The Titanic is older. So is dirty dancing  16 candles and fight club.,btohqsg
Maybe  but its considered popular when compared to its own genre.,btohqsg
titanic not coming of age movie tho,btohqsg
bring it on isnt even close to titanics tier,btohqsg
"a classic is ""a work of art of recognized and established value""",btohqsg
