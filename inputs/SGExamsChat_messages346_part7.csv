I believe we should have 0 crime,btohqsg
you could have zero crime but make life a living hell for law-abiding citizens. is that the best option?,btohqsg
Yeap  good one  settling and comparison is not the same,btohqsg
It wouldn't be 0 class divide,btohqsg
looks like u just changed your mind :),btohqsg
If working harder was enough then everyone would be a millionaire,btohqsg
Connections and networking plays a huge part,btohqsg
why would u think everyone should be a millionaire??,btohqsg
aren't we all in sg millionnaires?,btohqsg
I don't think everyone *should* be a millionaire,btohqsg
"because there is a concept known as ""your estate"" and that would be a big infringement on that. our economy was built upon the british common law system  and to do that and revamp the whole legal system would be to tera down the house if the door knob fell off",btohqsg
I think everyone should have a chance to be one,btohqsg
very good point! this destroys property rights,btohqsg
i claim everyone in sg is effectively already a millionnaire,btohqsg
and the right to property  if you think about it  is the most important thing next to magna carta lmao,btohqsg
yes  it is what Deng changed to unleash the economic giant that is China today,btohqsg
Do you think that someone born to a roadsweeper has the same chance of being a millionaire as the son of Lee Hsien Long?,btohqsg
"does s/he need to be? i think a lot depends on how you define ""millionnaire""",btohqsg
I believe they should have the same chance yes,btohqsg
china already had property rights   it was more of privatization of industry,btohqsg
in sg  everyone has access to a quality of life that they would need millions to achieve in other countries,btohqsg
"to clarify  i can have a chair  or a sofa in china  but not a ""skaven fan cheese making factory inc""",btohqsg
How many people here would consider themselves born into a upper middle class and above family,btohqsg
im aware and acknowledge the advantages it brought me compared to my peers,btohqsg
but i would say it aidded me  i had to open the can too  just with a nice little can opener,btohqsg
however  the elite top 1%... that might be argueable,btohqsg
I also am aware that my family has did their best to get be the best can opener they can,btohqsg
but we are talking about CRA which should not even be remotely the norm,btohqsg
It may not be the best can opener,btohqsg
But it's a pretty good one,btohqsg
yes  so its ridiculous to demand everyone throw away the can opener; USSR tried that and damn did it go well,btohqsg
I'm not telling everyone to throw away the can opener,btohqsg
I'm saying those with can openers should share their can openers with those who don't,btohqsg
singapore reasonably actually have decent social upflow,btohqsg
Instead of everyone not having a can opener,btohqsg
How about give everyone who needs one a can opener,btohqsg
i have a friend who im really proud of  he started with nothing and a piss poor family with an abusive father,btohqsg
but now he works at tik tok,btohqsg
Doesn't change the fact that he is the exception,btohqsg
nothing  sadly for singapore it brings problems for bto,btohqsg
Ur literally saying what the boomer are saying tho,btohqsg
his point is that sg disadvantages the community,btohqsg
hmm to bring in an exception is to bring in a comparison. are you trying to compare it with the singapore population or the world population,btohqsg
NS dont ask dont tell policy,btohqsg
Singapore ineligible for BTO and adoption,btohqsg
general social stigma and psychiatric/psychological support,btohqsg
I mean as long as u dont go around and announce ur gay to the whole world  nobody will bother u  lol,btohqsg
thats.... dont ask dont tell. why cant he be proud of what he is? that is the problem,btohqsg
"you are literally suggesting dont ask dont tell as ""fair""",btohqsg
The very fact that gay people have to hide the fact they are gay,btohqsg
