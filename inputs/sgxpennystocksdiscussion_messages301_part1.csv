I feel ISDN run up so furious the past weeks is because probably their result was leak out. Now if we enter based by the official result or profit guidance  the risk is there actually. Also the way they phrase their profit guidance can already tell how much their profit is ü§£,btohqsg
Cimb expected 200% net profit increase   guidance only mention 80%(fy2019: $7047 000)Did i decipher correctly?Probably did badly in q4 or exceptional writeoff -$2.3m?,btohqsg
