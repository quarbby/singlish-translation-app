Can I double check on this amaze card: I‚Äôm trying to pay  AIA premium which only accept MasterCard. Is it possible to use amaze (MasterCard) to set up recurring payment (monthly/yearly) and link to Citibank rewards card for (4miles/dollar). Is this rate better than using UOB absolute with grab pay master (1.7%)? I‚Äôm aware Citibank has a monthly limit of $1000. What about linking to OCBC titanium with amaze since it rewards 10x for online purchases with $12k annual limit. Thanks for advice!,btohqsg
No matter how u link amaze  the mcc excluded mean no point,btohqsg
Amaze card is not that amazing till it change the mcc  only change payment gateway to online,btohqsg
The exclusion applicable to both Citibank rewards and OCBC titanium?,btohqsg
Almost all card exclude insurance except uob absolute  amex true cashback  maybank prefer platinum and maybank horizon,btohqsg
Ok so the conversion to online spending using amaze  card doesn‚Äôt work out for this insurance premium case,btohqsg
U can always use the card but no benefit that all,btohqsg
Hey guys  quick qn - will I really be charged fall below fee for HSBC everyday global account? They says $2000 min balance,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôm aware thanksüòÄ becuase I recalled watching saying that pairing citi rewards and amaze can practically cover the online category even for physical shopping as the transaction through amaze can be covered as online spending,btohqsg
Ya online spending but need to see mcc,btohqsg
yes  but if keep $0 then they cannot deduct fee or switch to ega premier account no fall below fee,btohqsg
Thanks! Haha just worried if I keep $0  will it deteriorate my profile at the bank lol,btohqsg
dun think there is such issue. If u want can switch to premier account.,btohqsg
anyone know if paying at kiosk for mcdonald‚Äôs and online payment for food order at wokhey qualify as dining expense or online txn?,btohqsg
MCC should be the same for both. Just that one is contacless and one is online,btohqsg
Any idea if Revolut can be used with AXS?,btohqsg
Looking at metal plan.. they sent me a promo for premium price so thinking of using that as a public transport card (since I have no cards eligible for public transport hahaha),btohqsg
Revo no use Liao remove transport Perks,btohqsg
Unless u r new user I thinkThey already removed old user from the transportation perks,btohqsg
But I bet this new perk for new user won't be for long,btohqsg
