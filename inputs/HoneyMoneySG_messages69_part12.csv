Direct uob to axs can't clock $500,btohqsg
Oh really   cool. Good to know .,btohqsg
Why not ? Just wondering. I could be wrong.,btohqsg
Axs Blacklisted in uob one tnc,btohqsg
Oh right. Just wondering if go via amaze can bypass the AXS.,btohqsg
Okay sorry  i not sure if go via amaze can bypass the AXS blacklist. I was under impression the 500 through the insurance monthly straight to CC. Without AXS.,btohqsg
This is what I thought. U said can,btohqsg
Sorry  false alarm. Didn't read it properly. Paiseh. ü•≤,btohqsg
no  anything paid on AXS not counted to the $500 card spend,btohqsg
Even though use amaze to bypass?,btohqsg
I think amaze can't bypass the base MCC code,btohqsg
How about paying insurance on visa or master? No points but it qualifies for 500$ spend for uob and ocbc or ?,btohqsg
I always pay CC direct to insurer. AIA  GE  Prudential.,btohqsg
Not familiar with Manulife but it is quite surprising that they don't accept CC payment lol.,btohqsg
Terms and COnditions got state  must direct to insurerAs for why  probably because u can pay way more stuff with AXS  like ur utilities,btohqsg
Qualify as eligible spend for minimum 500 card spend?,btohqsg
if pay direct to insurance company using eligible uob card count to $500 card spend for uob one bonus interest,btohqsg
Yep CC direct insurer confirm qualify for 500 min spend.,btohqsg
Oh must be recurring basis ah,btohqsg
ü§î only see debit. No credit uob one card?,btohqsg
Is there a difference whether you pay ad-hoc every month ? I don't have any personal experience.,btohqsg
More expensive if its monthly üòÅ,btohqsg
actually not much diff since for annual payment u pay at the start of the year,btohqsg
#uobsavings#ask999timesMay I suggest for those of u taking part in the uob Christmas saving promo  when u send in the funds  do it as a one shot amount from outside bank with a clear comment ‚Äúuob Christmas 100k promo‚Äù so it is clear and no argument about whether it is fresh funds or not. I counted the character limit of 25 is sufficient.,btohqsg
I mean u pay annual premium at the start of the point of inception vs paying monthly premium. The money u use for monthly premium can earn interest in bank.,btohqsg
dun think uob care what u put in comments bah,btohqsg
i'm sure it helps yourself and the UOB checker!(i confirmed with UOB Live chat  that it is a manual process),btohqsg
Hi  May I ask something unrelated to credit card etc.What electricity company is good in sg? Should I fix 12 mths / 24 mths? I‚Äôm currently with SP.,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-deposit-accounts-fall-below-fee.htmlThe minimum can I place it all in savings account? like 500 + 3000 = 3500 put in savings account  then let multicurrency account be empty,btohqsg
Why do u do it? If u already have 100k making 5% pa on the uob one account  the extra 100k is earmarked (like a fixed deposit) making $550 for 4 months. The interest doesn‚Äôt make sense unless you are new account?,btohqsg
because account emptied to $1 on 30th Sep,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it is extra. Not necessarily to be a new account to register for the promo,btohqsg
I thought the whole world was shouting to empty UOB One account on 29th Sep already? The Christmas Savings promo was leaked on 29th Sep and we all knew it was with reference to 30th Sep's day end balance.,btohqsg
Hi guysQuestion heeeSo if I deposit 138k sgd (100k usd)I‚Äôll get 3k USD. How much exactly will I get in sgd ?I don‚Äôt need to convert it to sgd since it is under sgd fund right?I‚Äôm thinking of pulling some cash from moomoo for that promo,btohqsg
