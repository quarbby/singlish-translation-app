But what happens if you date a rich person and you are poor,btohqsg

Li Ann  Obama  Liu qiangdong  Ren zhengfei  Wang jianlin,btohqsg
When I think about it  one downside is that your rich gf might be accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle her whole life  then maybe you have to increase expenditure to keep up.,btohqsg
Hahahha you assuming the women doesn't earn her own money,btohqsg
What I am thinking is that your rich gf could have their own circle of friends that is rich then that is probably where you will spend more  like restaurant food,btohqsg
That's why门当户对is something most ppl seek,btohqsg
Erm pick someone ur own league,btohqsg
But tbh how are you supposed to know your league lol,btohqsg
Circle of friends  income level  habits  education etc ba,btohqsg

It was originally for his own students only,btohqsg
There was not enough girls so he opened it to the public,btohqsg

Last time he promoted it in nuswhispers,btohqsg
Why does he have a dating service,btohqsg
