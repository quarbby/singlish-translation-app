Book flat need ROM cert already?,btohqsg
Based on my experience  we did shown the staff our cert,btohqsg
Since we were already married before the bto launch,btohqsg
For us we gave a photocopy of our marriage cert to the HDB OfficerüôÇ,btohqsg
Yup but it's not a requirement to be married,btohqsg
Yup as we were married also during our flat selection,btohqsg
Now think of it  submitting of ROM cert during 1st two appointments also redundant if they need us to submit again upon key collection,btohqsg
Not relevant to me since we got married before the launch,btohqsg

Now then I know what is external landscape,btohqsg
may i please check if anyone here missed the appointment date before and appealed? tried to reschedule cannot already. asked to write in to officer. success of appeal high? thanks for advice üôèüèª,btohqsg
Desired unit might have chosen by others already,btohqsg
appointment missed was to sign SPA,btohqsg
This one missed is actually good news lol,btohqsg
Defer the compute of accrued interest,btohqsg
Look for MP if HDB no reply you,btohqsg
haha. the letter of appointment says that if missed  means unit will be cancelled.will call HDB monday. and try write in,btohqsg
You should do it tmr morning,btohqsg
Anyway LOA means lease of agreement,btohqsg
Aka 2nd appointment  making 5%/10% payment,btohqsg
So at this point if you don't want your unit  you only have the option fee forfeited,btohqsg
If you missed it hdb take it as u give up so ur option fees will be gone n u have to bto again.,btohqsg
To be honest with you even if u try appeal chances are slim,btohqsg
Weird  thought HDB will call you up if you missed your appointment on that day,btohqsg
I never went for unit selection  they called me up,btohqsg
