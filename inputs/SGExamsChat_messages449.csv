hi guys  wnna ask for opinions. Is it possible to quit an internship after submission of journals? For context the company i am working at is giving me insane deadlines and workloads. I have to OT almost everyday just to finish it and frankly im quite done with it. Not to mention my pay is already 2 weeks late despite repeated reminders. I have abt 1 month left but really dont want to 忍 anymore. Just wnna throw resignation letter💀,btohqsg
@chemcerhow many day mc u on,btohqsg
hmm but is it possible? technically i already submitted my work for grading 😂,btohqsg
lemme ask for more opinions before i do anyt,btohqsg
having the intern on your resume without any issues makes more sense in the long run,btohqsg
it’s wise to tahan until you have more of a say with what kind of work you wanna do,btohqsg
Have you spoken to your LO yet? Assuming this is a credit-bearing internship for school purposes.,btohqsg
I'd say just push thru the last one monthbetter to leave school without a bad record,btohqsg
What's an example of insane deadline? It's quite subjective,btohqsg
It may be insane to you but common in the industry,btohqsg
So without knowing even more details  your details are too one sided to give any opinion,btohqsg
Eg for an accountant friend  when he was a newbie  reaching home at 11pm is considered early,btohqsg
Im quitting a super shitty job,btohqsg
Should i send my resignation to the HR chat group or just my manager?,btohqsg

Wait not here in the other h2 grp chat lol,btohqsg
Those in jc/mi  can maybe advise me how to diy headstart econs + gps?,btohqsg
the only way to do well is to do alot of tys. Just do alot of it and learn the qn patterns and phrasing. in exam  u wont have time to think. u have to be on autopilot mode,btohqsg
revise your sec 3-4 english stuff for GP,btohqsg
Omg my Chinese cmi. I had to google translate this,btohqsg
the third way is to have money,btohqsg
was about to say that lmao,btohqsg
but second one more fun and useful skill in the long run :(,btohqsg
Yes  but it’s not what the education system rewards. Even in uni u don’t get the time to do that  and u don’t have a tys either,btohqsg
i disagree that uni doesn’t let you do that,btohqsg
that ones very subjective to the prof and how they structure their course/exams,btohqsg
Ah yes. Agreed. Agreed. Unfortunately those are rare and few between,btohqsg
in a sense some uni courses was easier to just practice instead of understand and still score,btohqsg
but maybe i’m lucky enough to feel i had the time to actually understand all of them,btohqsg
nah they just on the grindset,btohqsg
i don’t practice even in uni,btohqsg
i went in with understanding and kinda did that. practice would’ve helped but eh,btohqsg
ok i take it back. it’s not that i had time. i just chose to use the limited time to understand over practice,btohqsg
It ‘s somewhat true tho. A lot of ppl been doing home reno with a multitude of stuffs from Taobao tgt with some themes of their choice,btohqsg
Cuz u buy all ur stuff from Taobao?,btohqsg
I hardly buy local stuffs mostly imported,btohqsg
Yea I und. Ppl go as far as buying sofa and beds from there,btohqsg
I seen a lot of YT home reno vloggers does that for their BTO/resale,btohqsg

Hello  iam planning on learning Chinese cuz i have more free time  soon gonna regret it but lets see. 🥹,btohqsg
First gonna start from learning 10 new chracters,btohqsg
u can add the QWERTY options on ur keyboard,btohqsg
Handwriting is harder but QWERTY is more straightforward,btohqsg
I mean is ur learning pace so all ‘s gd,btohqsg
Yes  google says it would take two years  but i will master it in 1.5 years,btohqsg
This one depends on how fast one learns,btohqsg
If i were to be placed in people who knows only Chinese  there is a probability that i can able to speak and pronoun the words properly in one year.,btohqsg
Watch yt videos to came up with this concl😜,btohqsg
Just put yourself amongst people who only speak mandarin. I think you will be able to speak mandarin within a week,btohqsg
I got heart attack one second,btohqsg
Wow I admire your motivation to learn Chinese. I only know wo hen xihuan bingchilling,btohqsg
That one.. = social credit +1000,btohqsg
I like zhonggua and would love to visit once in a week.,btohqsg
looking forward to migrate to china with that one sentence,btohqsg
Why are people ranting about school campus,btohqsg
And it’s like theirs first day of ori,btohqsg

and after that it’ll be about subject combos,btohqsg
then after THAT it’ll be CCAs,btohqsg
not me ranting about h2 Geog everyday 😍😍😍,btohqsg
h2 geog can go and die tbf,btohqsg
i’m mad enough to join the founding team for ejc chinese debate but i’m not mad enough to put h2 geog as a first choice subject,btohqsg
If you give me history then I can accept,btohqsg
lmao who asked you to take h2 geog,btohqsg
tfw you accidentally take h3 econs before h2 econs,btohqsg
that shit is basically half the h3 econs syllabus,btohqsg
can someone add me to memesndreams,btohqsg

What’s this meme group I’m unaware of,btohqsg

NCC =/= good at ns stuff,btohqsg

He want to be noticed for best trainee award or smth,btohqsg
Ya. Maybe he can get into OCS,btohqsg
Ermmm.. My friends considered the PC  in my unit as a clown tho,btohqsg
They said things like he almost failed the cse,btohqsg
Gt all Kinds of ppl in the army,btohqsg
Did he ask anyone to wash clothes for him?,btohqsg
Hey. I feel that the one guy in my class will ask ppl to do that when he enlist,btohqsg
How much was he paid for that?,btohqsg
Ya. That one shld be free unless handwash,btohqsg
Hello anyone can help me w coding,btohqsg
y’all still hand wash clothes in camp right?,btohqsg
My ex -cop Father told me a bunch of amazing stories from his ns days,btohqsg
Man  if the walls could talk at our military camps,btohqsg
I thought upgrade to washing machine alr,btohqsg
Oh I texted him but seems like his bz,btohqsg
If bmt start to get modern equipment like waxing machines..it won’t be called “Basic military training l”,btohqsg
I js want to do my work,btohqsg
Cause Bedok talked about having a bunch of sohais in the military,btohqsg
Not really a lover per say,btohqsg
The cause is very simple  enlargement of muscle around the windpipe,btohqsg
Bruh 911 ain’t the number in sg ain’t it?,btohqsg
Bro there ain’t food anymore to throwup,btohqsg
You gonna need a c section,btohqsg

I’m a introvert  idk what is drip,btohqsg
EH ANYBODY WAN DRIP 16TH FEB,btohqsg
Ok  nvm sounds like a club,btohqsg
Y’all have such happening lives man...,btohqsg
but i got classes 10-4 LOL,btohqsg
How do y’all find friends like these... I have like a few dozen friends but all are Super introverted,btohqsg
They don’t leave the house  half of them don’t even attend school lmao,btohqsg
tbf i met q a few ppl in club oso lol,btohqsg
Bro   i have realised that when people say this...chances are  they have more woman than a king 1000 years ago will have,btohqsg
Bruh seems like always the people I eventually become friends with don’t ever leave the house lmao,btohqsg
Lmao I got a poly interview,btohqsg
Finally  I’m ending my first year of poly,btohqsg
Y’all want to Guess my poly gpa so far?,btohqsg
I know you from rp right?,btohqsg
The gpa im getting at my poly...let’s just say  will mean I have to remod 3> at the 4 other poly’s,btohqsg
I like how there are like 2k ppl here but the active are like below 20,btohqsg
Diploma in digital design and development,btohqsg
Let’s say  I scored a “E” for Two ESE last sem,btohqsg
And a d for a msa,btohqsg
I always feel like I’m trolling the education system honestly,btohqsg
No honestly  like the results I have gotten from school the last 18 years of my life really speaks volumes,btohqsg
Like I have been so close to ending my education journey in the last 5 consecutive years,btohqsg
Give me a sec  I’ll show you,btohqsg
i think it means he still young,btohqsg
It means i am old already,btohqsg
This was my sec 3 report book,btohqsg
I went from A1 to F9,btohqsg
A1 to F9 I don’t think is,btohqsg
I forgot what I did in sec 3,btohqsg
Looking at these results idk how,btohqsg
The last three national exams I ever took   Psle N and O levels...if any of them  I scored just one point less...I would not have been in Na or Sec 5 or RP,btohqsg
I’ve always been a borderline student,btohqsg
education system before uni is weird,btohqsg
I’ve noticed one thing about it,btohqsg
You can keep failing but still can progress,btohqsg
i’ve voiced my opinion on it here quite a few times lol,btohqsg
You can keep failing subjects in sec school  but they won’t kick you out,btohqsg
Idk abt ite so I can't sau,btohqsg
as in it’s just not a good system lol,btohqsg
Ohyeah it's complicated to explain ngl,btohqsg
Something l have always thought about is how NA is just a more glorified NY,btohqsg
lol i don’t even fully understand all the paths myself tbh,btohqsg
The amount of people that would eventually go ITE/Poly in nt is always heavily favoured to ite,btohqsg
the streaming from PSLE is a joke anyway,btohqsg
I roughly do but don't as well,btohqsg
80 students went to NA...we had the largest NA Cohort in 10 years so  our cohort were split into 3 classes,btohqsg
50+ went ite after n levels  6 went to poly ...over 20 went sec 5,btohqsg
i rmb my year psle they still showed the lowest aggregate,btohqsg
but they removed in like 2012 change i think,btohqsg
My sch didn't show score at all,btohqsg
Bruh I still rmb ...everyone was saying how my psle was the hardest in a decade,btohqsg
Sec they show how many dists,btohqsg
my sch generally do well for psle,btohqsg
Bro  my school did the sec 5’s dirty when I was a sec 5,btohqsg
Mooooood thus drop out to do private,btohqsg
All of us were in the hall  they proceeded to show the whole o levels cohort that over 50% of students failed to pass 3 or more subjects,btohqsg
is the dumbest shit in the world,btohqsg
But the issue here was  we only had one sec 5 class,btohqsg
And they showed the sec 5 cohort,btohqsg
i just have a hate for them deciding that some students can’t handle o levels based on this,btohqsg
The moment I saw the psle grading system...I knew we were doomed  y’all seen it yet?,btohqsg
If you scored a 46  you see in the same range as someone that scored a 64,btohqsg
No wonder  in the last 10 years...sg closed over 100 schools,btohqsg
Over 30 of them were sec schools,btohqsg
When you go Sec 1  literally 5 years of maths educations is summaries into one year,btohqsg
They shud have an exam regardless of level,btohqsg
Then don't need to compare this and that,btohqsg
We used to have that  a few decades ago...what happened was  it destabilised the private tutoring industry,btohqsg
Can see who can't do well in which section,btohqsg
It put students whom parents had the money to spend tutoring kids a leverage over the poorer kids,btohqsg
Then you don't have to like nt na ex,btohqsg
I still use them when I was in Os,btohqsg
I think I still got my model set in my room somewhere,btohqsg
It's the same thing as Os,btohqsg
You do wrong method = mark wrong,btohqsg
They shud be given the marks,btohqsg
Like why need do specifically elimination when can do substitution,btohqsg
Why do guess and check when can do assumption,btohqsg
Did anybody here know that  in ITE early days...a PSLE student could enroll into ITE?,btohqsg
