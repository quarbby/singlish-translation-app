Ohh wait never mind  inspection isit,btohqsg
All along never do before ahah,btohqsg
Don't bring to their so called recommended workshop,btohqsg
Bring to your friend or someone u know,btohqsg
This kind of thing <$150 just spend and do a thorough check at ws,btohqsg
Is like feeling a bit of chest discomfort and you wanna just Google your symptoms and be your own doctor,btohqsg
For the previous 2 car that I bought  I test drive  I like  I buy.,btohqsg
Haha yea I mean  even if I open bonnet I also donâ€™t know what to see,btohqsg
I recently bought a OBD scanner but still havenâ€™t arrive in (SG) either,btohqsg
Maybe thatâ€™s why I always go workshop kena chop carrot head,btohqsg
chop what? PPI is before you even buy the car,btohqsg
if car got any problem immediately get discount from dealer or seller  so you can fix,btohqsg
As in whenever I go service my prev car  always tell me need change this and that,btohqsg
you go wrong workshop liao la,btohqsg
Can just ask them send to STA and Iâ€™ll pay? STA reliable?,btohqsg

cmon why h00k also banned word?,btohqsg
how they bait you h00k line and sinker,btohqsg
service cheap cheap  then they chop you by telling you need change this change htat,btohqsg
not all cheap things are the best,btohqsg
Yea thatâ€™s why haha  tell me need change engine oil  change filter etcetc,btohqsg
I think best to leave it to actual mech  I donâ€™t trust myself,btohqsg
So actually no point doing PPI since at the end of the day the most expensive part is still not guaranteed ah,btohqsg
but they are experienced to at least tell you it is mechanically sound for now,btohqsg
But other than PPI no issue with consignment cars right?,btohqsg
Dk why dealer always donâ€™t dare to say consignment until after going down lo,btohqsg
consignment literally is dealership selling on behalf of direct owner... so you can consider it as buying from owner,btohqsg
PPI only cover some parts most of the issue will arise as time goes by forFor those who want to play safe buy from your friend's workshop or someone u know that personally own the car,btohqsg
I wish I got friend who has nice car  or friends to begin with ðŸ¥²,btohqsg

He could be another@historyofmanin the making,btohqsg

But now Mr History change to better workshop,btohqsg
If they're specialists with the brand and have experience  they tend to know what problems to check for on the specific model,btohqsg
Actually you can still get to know quite a bit about it. End of the day it is a machine and can fail in unusual ways but you can be quite sure if you ppi at a good place.,btohqsg
A place that specializes in the car,btohqsg
Usually best to go specialist who you know or specialist who tends to overcharge and advise high repairs,btohqsg
