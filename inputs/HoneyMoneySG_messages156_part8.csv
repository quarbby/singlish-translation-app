Bro    I been using amex tcb to pay for monthly s&cc fees via singpost app . 1.5% cashback,btohqsg
Which tc? Not all tc accept tcb,btohqsg
Okay I am still using flashpay method,btohqsg
What about amex ascend? Is it good.,btohqsg
Also can since flash pay can top up using tcb too . Just that got 0.50 fees,btohqsg
Some accept e.g Education  Healthcare  some Town Council and etc.Used to pay my kids schools fees. MOE migrated from SAM to AXS this year though,btohqsg
Not good. Higher and harder to waive AF. No lounge access.,btohqsg
Ah I just realise the bonus interest will only credit in May 2025 for Feb 2025 bonus interest campaign,btohqsg
get pot of gold bonus cashback upfront upon earmark,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to check  for Citi SMRT  for the 5% cashback  the website states Online (exclude mobile wallet)  so means cannot add to Apple/Samsung pay?,btohqsg
Btw is there any confirmation for this promotion campaign? Sign up last Friday but have not received any confirmation email.,btohqsg
No. Just do correctly can already. You will know it's confirmed when your monies get earmarked.,btohqsg
Can add  just that you cannot use the wallet for in-app payment. You can use the wallet for contactless payment at terminals e.g. at supermarkets  on BUS/MRT  etc.,btohqsg
Kindly take note for CIMB customer...,btohqsg
Not as attractive as to put money in dividend stocks,btohqsg
RIP. It was bad and now worse.,btohqsg
I managed to pay via Chocolate under Nee Soon Tiwn Council.,btohqsg

is the choc fin card unable to use for axs permanently banned or just for now?,btohqsg
hi  can anyone guide for IRAS  if all the claims need to be manually entered? or most of it is automatically,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone can advise if we are able to get back the 30% withholding tax on SGOV from our trade in SCB online equities trading?Understand that interest earned from US TREASURIES should be tax exempt. I got back the withholding tax from IBKR but not from SCB,btohqsg
Choco finance said they're working with axs to sort out the issues  but don't know if there will be a favourable outcome,btohqsg
Prepare for the worst. Xnap told us to wait for them to come back and see how everything is now. üò¢,btohqsg
Everyone should not be too disappointedIt is never sustainable for an economy where people can get a decent return from pure savings accounts. Something is wrong somewhere if that is the case.Fixed Deposit different story.,btohqsg
Sounds like XNAP working on their side. Don't put too much faith in it.,btohqsg
At least XNAP has substitutesAXS + heymax has no known substitutes,btohqsg
AXS and SAM used to be comparables..SAM now is really lousy,btohqsg
You mean AXS + Chocolate Finance,btohqsg
this is a good pointi think more people view it as HEYMAX card instead of chocolate card... haha,btohqsg
Ya... Then ppl complain to Heymax and waste their time. 100% confirm sure got someone already did it  just never come out only.,btohqsg
dunno if chocolate has a telegram too,btohqsg
My point is that heymax is bankrolling the rewards; choco is just providing the conduit. Otherwise there are plenty of credit and debit cards to use on AXS; just that none of them give rewards,btohqsg
Hi do mthly subscription eg.  ClassPass membership consider online for Citibank rewards ?,btohqsg
ibkr refunds you tax withheld? wow  i thought sure kena 30%  ibkr that good to sponsor and waive your withheld tax?,btohqsg
If you go and read up on US Treasuries  there is no withholding tax on them. IBKR did hold it for a year before refunding it.SCB so far no.,btohqsg
taxes for US related securities is always a minefield.there are instances whereby you SHOULD NOT get taxed  but due to admin reasons  particularly unable to segregate between clients  everyone gets taxed.,btohqsg
Totally agree. So far  IBKR experience is still the best for US securities.SCB unfortunately does not hold the mark. Their replies were simply either vague or textbook answers. Which is like what most assume  flat 30% withholding tax for non US persons.,btohqsg
a recent negative of IBKR i faced is being unable to support dividend currency election.,btohqsg
Only nets payment for Ang mo Kio town council using Sam mobile.,btohqsg
yea can see the payment modes herehttps://www.singpost.com/pay,btohqsg
Can download the form for credit card recurring setup.,btohqsg
Hi for uob preferred platinum vs uob lady card which card is better for general use? Such as dining and groceries,btohqsg
If you can get uob lady solitaire  uob lady. Else  uob ppv,btohqsg
uob lady only good for selected category,btohqsg
Heard that eventhough u dont meet the 120k minimum amount   it is still possible to get lady solitaire? Is it true?,btohqsg
Yes I heard success stories but there are still some salary floors. Different times had different numbers. Recently it has been stricter.Still  no harm to give it a try. üòÅ,btohqsg
