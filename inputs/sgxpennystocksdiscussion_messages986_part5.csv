WTI crude oil futures climbed to $73.5 per barrel on Thursday  reaching their highest level since October  fueled by optimism about oil demand and a report showing shrinking US crude stockpiles. Optimism grew following Chinese President Xi Jinping's New Year address  in which he expressed confidence in China’s economic recovery despite global uncertainties. Additionally  China’s manufacturing sector continued its slight expansion for the third consecutive month  further lifting expectations of strong oil demand.,btohqsg
