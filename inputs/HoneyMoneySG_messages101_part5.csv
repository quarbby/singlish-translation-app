hopefully as US rate cuts delayed will also delay further interest rate cuts by local banks. I just bought US 10y at 4.5%,btohqsg
Amaze is Mastercard only. Can still cancel?,btohqsg
Installments by bank don't for rewards.,btohqsg
Are there any revolut sign up promotion?,btohqsg
Nothing much different for overseas purchases  other than adding amaze. Can refer to this videohttps://youtu.be/Kkkg1o_eWvo?si=LWCf3_YWIL_IdeyT,btohqsg
We do not discuss that here,btohqsg
interest rates go down  bond price goes up. Not bond interest,btohqsg
"Fr investopedia ""Most bonds pay a fixed interest rate that becomes more attractive if interest rates fall  driving up demand and the price of the bond. Conversely  if interest rates rise  investors will no longer prefer the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond  resulting in a decline in its price.""",btohqsg
Thanks  no current promotion right? Nothing mentioned,btohqsg
US$250k for 10y. have other shorter dated,btohqsg
And if using syfe cash+  the only option is to hold till maturity and so there should be minimal impact by interest rate momements?,btohqsg
when interest rates move down  bond prices increase (becos more pple buying to seek better return)  which then drives down bond yields,btohqsg
How sensitive would bond interests be from money market funds in such scenarios?,btohqsg
Money market funds will just pay less interest as they are often invested in short term products like fixed deposits and Tbills.Ie they will not benefit from falling interest rates.,btohqsg
Hello! I am currently pairing Citi rewards with amaze. But the 1k domestic spend nerf will limit my spending. What would be a good combo with Citi rewards card now?,btohqsg
Would they also be less affected by falling interest rates? Since these are short term products?,btohqsg
No. They are totally affected by changing interest rates because they have underlyings that are short term and need to be constantly renewed at prevailing interest rates.,btohqsg
May i know currently which cc offer free to airport lounge yearly aside fr citi primer miles ?,btohqsg
citi rewards 4mpd is limited to $1k in statement month. Not elaborate further what issue u facing?,btohqsg
Dept store doesn’t need to pair with Amaze,btohqsg
Would anyone know how and when HSBC ega giro interests are paid? Thank you.,btohqsg
The rebate comes in 1 day after your giro is deducted from ega,btohqsg
What are examples of bonds  we can buy? E.g. SSB buy/sell at same value  once locked in it is not affected by interest rate movements. Thank you,btohqsg
Hi  a follow up to this… am overseas now and am using CRxAmaze for spending… if i have past 1k spending  would it be more beneficial to use OCBC n90? N90 will have 1.3mpd in $5 blocks  but CR after 1k is 0.4mpd is that correct…?I know UOB lady’s is beneficial. But I do not have UOB lady’s card unfortunately as of now,btohqsg
SSB redemption can be done in partial  need pay $2 admin fee and there is a specific window period to redeem.Once locked in  the fixed interest payout,btohqsg
For local  SSBFor US  Can look at US Treasury as an  example (for illustration purpose only)https://fund-upgrowth.sg.moomoo.com/fego/us_treasuries_v3,btohqsg
I wouldn't use any cards less than 2 mpd/2.5% cashback with amaze  the fee isn't worth it,btohqsg
Ocbc365 seems like there isn't any promotion on new sign up. Should I wait for a promotion or just signup,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. Appreciate the advice. Then will likely change to use my youtrip/trust card. Appreciate the advice/insights as always!,btohqsg
Then again if you're using it to clock OCBC 360 spend criteria  I think it's okay to use it despite the fees *assuming you need to make effort to hit it*,btohqsg
I wonder if I applied UOB credit card overseas  and I apply UOB credit card here  would I still qualify for the sign up bonuses,btohqsg
Different country  different entity and rules. You will qualify,btohqsg
Apply now if you want to use to clock 360 ACC  if not just wait for promo. As someone who recently cancelled ocbc365  got to say this card is not worth using after all the nerf. You have to hit min $800 spend per month  no bonus cashback on 5814 where majority of food places use  pharmacy only limited to Watson  no more travel category. After spending $800 per month  I only got around $30 cashback,btohqsg
FairPrice Zhongshan told me they stopped selling gift cards already.,btohqsg
Any good card to replace it instead as i have 360 saving acc,btohqsg
Seems like only US treasuries may benefit from interest rate cut and may increase in price. For local SSB  you get what you once locked in. Thank you.,btohqsg
That's why I said get it if you want to clock the 360 acc bonus interest  there's additional cashback there,btohqsg
If not UOB evol can get $40 for $600 spend,btohqsg
Sorry but wanna know how does buying shopback vouchers work for ocbc 360 card?,btohqsg
Is shopback voucher under any of the categories?,btohqsg

Hi can guys apply uob ladies account?,btohqsg
Whats the best broker for me to park my cash to regenerate decent yield %,btohqsg
Can look at Moomoo (New & Existing customer) or Webull (new customer) or Tiger (new customer)https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/188607,btohqsg
"As long as you withdraw out before you click ""Participate"" in the new campaign",btohqsg
Not interest  but investment returns. All investments involves risk,btohqsg
At the max subscription amount of 10K tier$50 000 * 6.8% p.a. * 20/365 = $186,btohqsg
Is shopback spending eligible for ocbc 360 credit card?,btohqsg
