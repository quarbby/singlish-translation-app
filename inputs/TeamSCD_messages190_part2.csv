This kind of female drivers can trust ah,btohqsg
My bro bought  woman driver  30k mileage  end up nvr change EO,btohqsg
Since he desperate  I will wait until closer to May then offer him lower than 81k,btohqsg
Over 30k mileage. Flushed out EO  black like kopi O,btohqsg
sold liao no regrets ok lo hahahaha,btohqsg
And workshop PPI also not necessarily foolproof also.,btohqsg
Cos you go to them to check  likely is you go to them when things break down,btohqsg
They will tell you everything is fine  cos they know you coming back to pay them salary,btohqsg
I also not very eager to get his car but see how when it's closer to May,btohqsg
Like transformer movie said ‚Äúnot the driver who choose cars  is the cars choose the driver‚Äù,btohqsg
Ultimately  you buy a 2nd hand car  it's always a gamble. Just need to rmb to set aside funds to repair.,btohqsg
And i pray u gamble to lose money like me,btohqsg
end of the day  buy used car  be prepared to fix it up,btohqsg
I know now demand for 2nd hand car not high especially when many ppl hoping coe will drop next few years,btohqsg
Hahahaha i spent over 10k to fix my car alr,btohqsg
My old swift i maintained it very well. Till now the new owner nv complain got issues.,btohqsg
Old car problems  2nd hand car also problem.,btohqsg
If only ppl like u  we be living in peace,btohqsg
Oh and check rims when buying 2nd hand car,btohqsg
always just assumed it'll be fine,btohqsg
No wonder car vibrates alot even after changing,btohqsg
Used car ah. Pull the dipstick  touch the oil and rub between fingers. If its watery instead of oily. Walk away,btohqsg
This one common sense applies haha,btohqsg
If everyone have common sense  we also be living in peace,btohqsg
But watery is a sign of poor grade oil  overheating engine or the oil long time nv change,btohqsg
Got fd2r  take out dipstick   no oil,btohqsg
Car sold eventually at 15m depre,btohqsg
I wonder if there's a mechanic I can ask along to go car mart together for few hours and help buyers check on the spot if the car really got no problem especially mileage tampering and EO ü§î,btohqsg
If u close to ur mech and he is free,btohqsg
"Then the sgcm ads will say ""meticulous OCD owner. Owned by car enthusiast  serviced at 5k""",btohqsg
Of course will pay him lah for his trouble,btohqsg
He need to hoist it up,btohqsg
Unless we know him   talk to him or see his ride   maybe can say,btohqsg
if serviced at AD den can call and check,btohqsg
plug in ODB some cars can see,btohqsg
‚Äú160 point check performed by our workshop!‚Äù,btohqsg
That's why@Leslhy88buy 2nd hand car really is a gamble. You paranoid so much also no use,btohqsg
99% of the dealers wont have,btohqsg
But at least with some knowledge u can catch the obvious,btohqsg
Another way I used is to check whether this indicator got remain light up after 5 seconds. Not sure reliable or not,btohqsg
I gave my servicing records to my consign agent also. The new guy nv receive,btohqsg
have but you usually you need to know the workshop to hire out their mech,btohqsg
buy brand new for no worries..,btohqsg
Good condition  undercarriage rusted and got lobang,btohqsg
definitely. But in the end still will have things spoil one,btohqsg
My car i bring to workshop PPI,btohqsg
No oil leaks  no coolant leaks  chassis straight,btohqsg
end up also so many daiji,btohqsg
Car didnt trust u and didnt choose u,btohqsg
Now he dont have a choice,btohqsg
