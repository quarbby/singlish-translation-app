And then next year  you will be familiar with everything because you have done it this year. Only revise the content,btohqsg

Because it only tells you your grade. Not what is right and what is wrong. You go there for the experience and to learn from it  since you cannot get the exam fees refunded.,btohqsg
My course can up to 26,btohqsg
So 4subject can have up to 25,btohqsg

B3 for AMath is very achievable,btohqsg
So why don't you take it this year? If it is not good then repeat next year. At least you probably would not get F9 this year...,btohqsg
If you don't sit for it this year it is automatically F9,btohqsg
