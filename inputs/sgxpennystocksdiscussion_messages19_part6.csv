haha..u seem have bad vibes on vp,btohqsg
345 is key chart support. Holds anotNo idea. I sucks at chartResults play only insider know.Maybe a bounce will be in place for Vicplas since medtecs also likely to have an oversold bounce. Which are both tradeable,btohqsg
Bounce to 40 cent makes scalpers happyInvestors still got tears,btohqsg

Takeover cannot only based on NAV  earning potential more important.Anyway  to me a company NAV is no use unless the bulk is in cash n liquid assets. U can have big NAV  but if your cash flow is bad  the company can also goes under. Also  if business bad as O&G  u see all have big NAV few years bad  only to write down to 0 or negative.,btohqsg
u cant top jerry and gem,btohqsg
Sounds wrong but won‚Äôt mind the mistake,btohqsg

looks like got fair bit of VP supporters out there,btohqsg
vicplas been discussed back on 5 and 11 Aug... it started out low volume and nobody dare to buy at 20cents... volume came in after it hits 30cents... i would say for people who are not vested in vicplas and looking to buy it... wait for results to be out,btohqsg
Like that need create many support groupsMSGTSGSSGRSG,btohqsg
Ya wait for results as information on forefront medical secure project   also mass produced 40million test kit  arrow medical secure provide ppe to Birmingham look like vp will likely gain earning from there n likely to bb,btohqsg
for the price now... they need to have increase in earnings 250% to maintain the same PE ratio pre-covid,btohqsg
their ppe i saround 45million to pvc pipe of 35million... so it's been discussed that this 35million is as good as half gone due to construction halt,btohqsg
Not sian meh every stock must have an auntie agony cornerWhen Chiong all shout here scared nobody knowWhen toh all hide in a group to cry and whine together,btohqsg
so unless the 45million medical has margin like maybe 20% and above... unlikely to see improvement on earnings... share price was at 14cents before the run up... u decide what's your EP,btohqsg
What is auntie agony corner mean?,btohqsg
My view is Can't base on past earnings as made know they into covid related medical on June 20,btohqsg
it was before that... i think back in april people mentioned about forefront medical on sharejunction alr,btohqsg
So base on past earning on pipe would be wrong info,btohqsg
But nevertheless somehow affected on pipeline business,btohqsg
yeap... so it's been discussed back in Aug... that the 45million medical device revenue will increase... but the 35million pvc pipe revenue will drop,btohqsg
Ya and forefront medical have a lot more to offer not just test kit   nasel swab n ppe,btohqsg
i was discussing with you... you still ask me call the boss,btohqsg
Please add me to MT group..üôèüôè,btohqsg
i think@acac86mentioned that you're from construction line... you should have a rough idea of how bad vicplas pvc pipe biz gonna get affected,btohqsg
Can someone add me into the MT group Pls!,btohqsg
