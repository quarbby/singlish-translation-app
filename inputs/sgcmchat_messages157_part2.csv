R35 means only got 35 left,btohqsg
The ones u see is GTST cos ST means similar edition,btohqsg
720s spider means only got 720,btohqsg
is 592k ex or cheap for a taycan,btohqsg
neither. but there is some plus minus depending what options it has. Considering it's PI  the price compared to agent isnt a big diff  making it bad value,btohqsg
u called me a black monkey siaðŸ¥²,btohqsg
u called me all sorts of things,btohqsg

Typical steal foto type of ppl,btohqsg

Ngl the top widget looks like an android the bottom looks like the apple thing,btohqsg
but wmmt ffb is absolute shit,btohqsg
355 challenge  initial d has better ffb,btohqsg
and 355 challenge was from the 90s.,btohqsg
battle gear had amazing ffb too.,btohqsg
not sure why you're being so fucked in the ass about it lol,btohqsg
the FFB system has been the same since WMMT3  about time they changed it.,btohqsg
i play it from time to time to chill  but it's fucked that the ffb hasn't changed since the 2000s.,btohqsg
don't take jabs at others without looking at the bigger picture.,btohqsg
yeah. only when you go over the bridge expanders. that's it.,btohqsg
that's your perception  i have mine,btohqsg
why are you so fucked in the ass about it lol,btohqsg
ffb needs work for wmmt to keep up,btohqsg
look if you have an issue  message me privately,btohqsg
my opinion is that wmmt needs work. ffb wise,btohqsg
if you want to be dense in the head then you do you,btohqsg
and am i supposed to give a shit about how it comes across..?,btohqsg
in general  the game needs work,btohqsg
if you can't understand the point that i'm trying to raise  then i suggest you should take a step back,btohqsg
i've tried WMMT on a belt driven  directdrive and gear driven wheel.,btohqsg
Honestly i feel like itâ€™s still important to be civil,btohqsg
the ffb on those are significantly better than what they offer,btohqsg
there is a lot of people here and itâ€™s good to be a little polite sometimes,btohqsg
hence why i'm saying that it's behind the times,btohqsg
but being aggro about wmmt being suited for kids and all,btohqsg
but if he wants to be a white knight and be the shining star that loves wmmt without understanding my point,btohqsg
then it doesn't make sense to me,btohqsg
tbvh marc he was a lot more civil about this than you were,btohqsg
if you scroll up and look at the tone and language used,btohqsg
letâ€™s just try to be more level headed with all discussions guys,btohqsg
shittiest ffb ever btw holy shit,btohqsg
the ffb was so dog i just gave up,btohqsg
