Really? Can you share with me what is ssb? It can give more than 10 percent every year?,btohqsg
He thought the projected meaning 14years not per year.,btohqsg
Ooh  because usually if we put fd  per year max also 4 percent only. So when the agent told me every year 7-10 percent which is quite attractive. But it is a deep 14 years lock hole üï≥Ô∏è,btohqsg
Just for context  what are using NETS FlashPay for? ü§î,btohqsg
Haha a lot of ILPs after fees only 3% p.a. if you hold past 20 years.. And only 1.5% p.a. if you hold less than 15 years.. You keep in bank also higher interest rates ü§™,btohqsg
I see  thanks bro for your advice  will consider ssb or Tbill in the future. üôèüèª,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your advice bro üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yea i tot u meant 7-10% total return after 14 years. Anyway  no way u r getting 7-10% every year. Thats most likely the projected fund performance. Whether the fund can do that is unknown. Even if it can  u still need to deduct fund fees  commissions  cost of insurance etc. U will be lucky to breakeven after 14 years.,btohqsg
For car‚Äôs parking and erp charges etc,btohqsg
I see  many people start parking their money to this long term plan  because now they give very attractive welcome rewards. I tot should give it a try. But seems like a lot of hidden cost and the performance also based on assumptions. And tenure is too long  they have shorter one  lock 5 years and take profit on the 7th year  but the welcome rewards not so great,btohqsg
The flash pay Atu will allow you to pay without worry even when going to 0 balance. As it will automatically reload by charging the card as needed,btohqsg
Unfortunately no cards support rewards for NETS top-ups anymore üòÖStill got chance if you use it for public transport or retail spend as you can do it directly on your credit cards.,btohqsg
At most ERP charges just charge to EZ-Pay  then you don't have to worry no money. Will charge to your credit card but no rewards.Alternatively you can use vCashCard  when not enough money they will ATU for you. Fee waived for every $50 top-ups. Now only supports ERP but can support carpark in the future.Once you have the new OBU ERP IU  you can change to use NETS Motoring Card  can also setup ATU and even earn WINK+ points.,btohqsg

Hi ¬† Has anyone followed the Crypto Alex Trades channel and joined their Crypto currency trading (Alex Mccayna)? Would appreciate it if you could share your experience (good and bad) that you have traded with them? Thanks.,btohqsg
Typically no one here replies to crypto related messages. Do your own research  at least 99.9% of these type of groups/channels are scams.,btohqsg
Thank you@melvyn- will try and report back here :),btohqsg
I don‚Äôt trade crypto  just buy and hold. If you want latest info or news from crypto  can consider to watch investanswer YouTuber.,btohqsg
i day trade both crypto and stocks but i do not follow anyone as they are all ‚Äúfake gurus‚Äù,btohqsg
"Suggest you watch this for your exposure  it's not just for the particular channels you mentioned but also for the whole ""Trading guru"" industryhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy4k_GVLEko",btohqsg
No I don't really trade at the moment. Just exploring what are the earnings opportunities üòÑ,btohqsg

For SC Bonus Saver Credit Card  does insurance counts as eligible spend for the $500?,btohqsg

Hey gurus! Just gotta quick question I‚Äôd like to check. Currently my salary is credited to OCBC 360 account  and I‚Äôd like to enjoy the 5% bonus interest that UOB One is offering. Thinking of using the PayNow SALA workaround to fulfil the $1 600 criteria. Is this recommended and any associated risks?,btohqsg
Lots of people have done it  no risk from what I understand,btohqsg
does this mean amaze converts all foreign spendings to online local spendings?,btohqsg
It will work. Remember that EIR 5% p.a. is for 100k. And you need to spend $500 on eligible UOB CC.,btohqsg
Yes that's the point of using amaze. They typically have an decent conversion rate with 0% FX fee.,btohqsg
Yes. If u want to clock the foreign spend  don't use amaze,btohqsg
Is it because got no such thing as SC Bonus Saver Credit Card? LolOr are you referring to credit card spend on SCB Bonu$aver account?,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the best card to use in korea?,btohqsg
I use trust card. Exchange rate quite good and no fee,btohqsg
I got youtrip too but find it troublesome as need to top up,btohqsg
I use iChange. It‚Äôs confirmed the rate is better than YouTrip and trust.,btohqsg
True. The card came after I am back from Korea,btohqsg
Isn't when we open SC Bonus Saver account  we will also get a SC Bonus Saver Credit Card?,btohqsg
but the app still needs abit of tweaking as it is slow in loading,btohqsg
that is true but i just use Amaze combo whenever possible or withdraw local currency using youtrip,btohqsg
The default is credit card if you have a credit card. But you can request for a debit card as well. Pls note I applied more than 10 years ago. Not sure if that‚Äôs the case now. I have never used the credit card.,btohqsg
Okay my bad  the only info for the credit card is within the card and it's not a credit card that can apply separately. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Much confusion.And seems like that card don't really provide anything other than clock spending for the SC Bonus$aver account? Unless you separately apply for SC Bonus$aver World MC?,btohqsg
Actually I wanna ask if we need to meet the 2k credit spending  can we charge our mthly Insurance to the credit card linked from the SC Bonus Saver Account?,btohqsg
Hi expert  anyone have idea how Singpass my info derive income for credit card application. I would like to apply for a credit card with min income 120k  however my annual basic only 90k but include quarterly bonus will exceed 120. Do you think it can approve now or should I wait till April when 2023 NOA is out,btohqsg
Based on tnc  Online Bill Payments and AXS payments are ineligible. Might still have chance if you pay through your insurance website.,btohqsg
