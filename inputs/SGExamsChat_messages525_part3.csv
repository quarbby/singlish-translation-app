"This is not how you should view war...Its not ""Who fired the first shot"" but rather ""Why the first shot was fired""",btohqsg
I never loved history tbh but when I wrote I scored,btohqsg
eg of common question bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki justified or not,btohqsg
i smoked this when i was asked this during humanities,btohqsg
hiroshima/nagasaki is prob one of the easiest qns they could have asked,btohqsg

likely a fallback  weakened by the US one,btohqsg
ehh I go annoy my pets,btohqsg
if the US did not have their own  likely asia's one would not have been as bad,btohqsg
The TLDR is the Trade imbalance and rise of the Asian tigers lead to massive current account deficits and surplus which the system of fixed exchange rates could not support,btohqsg
Then u also have to explain the shit fest of timing,btohqsg
In As especially for H2 History it's Economic History which is totally different monster,btohqsg
i still cant believe how fucked japan was dealt with from this,btohqsg
They still haven't recovered till today lol,btohqsg
I do not understand what u meant by that,btohqsg
The more I grow up  the more I realised I gave too much care for situations I need not care,btohqsg
japan did not really get involved did they?,btohqsg
I have this piece of shit classmate,btohqsg
the problem with this is when  ppl actually should care. they dont and this is why now you got a US president that cant talk properly and falls every now and then,btohqsg
I found it funny to read such stuff,btohqsg
My sense of humor is that fucked up,btohqsg
''if u think people care about u enough to even hate you  u are thinking too highly of urself'',btohqsg
what actually impacted japan so greatly is the real qns,btohqsg
Why do u care about ppl hating me when I am already engrossed with how much I hate myself,btohqsg

Japan wasn't rlly affect a lot by the AFC.,btohqsg
The AFC refers to Thailand Indonesia and South Korea Mainly,btohqsg
but they got fucked during the timeline for some reason,btohqsg
Care for things which is necessary  that's appropriate,btohqsg
They got fuck separately from the AFC,btohqsg
They would have been fucked either ways,btohqsg
bruh im so lost with the elections,btohqsg
The US Presidential Elections or SG Presidential Election?,btohqsg
Care but don't get obsessed wit it  uknowhatimsayinÂ¿,btohqsg
i could give two shits bout the US...clowns they are,btohqsg
Why? The candidates have been announced already?,btohqsg
Hahahaha u must be new it doesn't matter in the SG context either ways,btohqsg
that is the problem lol  i cant do any background research and then by the time they get announced ill have no time to ever check up the candidate's reputation,btohqsg
oh yea  i forgot what the president in sg does. The one that i should be concern with should be the prime minister elections,btohqsg
We all know who's gonna win anyways it will be the case for the next 2-3 cycles anyways,btohqsg
