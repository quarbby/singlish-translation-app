ü§£ not as pain as when the ladies or guys wearing dr. mart shoes. You will be sorry for your toes,btohqsg
How you bought it ? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
cannot bring on airplanes tho tsk,btohqsg
I not familiar with online shopping you see üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
You sign up an account and followed the shop ..sometimes have vouchers given,btohqsg
Or you can find best selling power banks sometimes have discounts,btohqsg
When cart out apply the vouchers.. new users sometimes have vouchers. Everyday click check in to clock rebates for coins..,btohqsg
Or u can pay by installments but use at your own riskü§£,btohqsg
The more 00 u see means higher voltage ‚ö°Ô∏è thus the higher pricr,btohqsg
Well the only time I bought online was in fact after graduation from Poly to buy graduation gown and that's it,btohqsg
Don't start online shopping..you've been a good boy..ü§£,btohqsg
It's so convenient..and you will be swapping cards like a proüòÇ,btohqsg
I am IT course graduate but still reserved about buying stuff online until last week when I considered purchasing foreign language keyboard,btohqsg
Wah liew..when taobao is your BFF.. you will be buying a van home seh,btohqsg
Ooh no..everything is so convenient in sg now,btohqsg
Lol as in foreign language keyboard,btohqsg
Just with a click and bank cards,btohqsg
I bought one from tiktok translate foreign language,btohqsg
So have to buy from online sources uh,btohqsg
U want I can share the link here..seller very good..I tested the product,btohqsg
I asked my foreign language teacher   she explained she modified her keyboard overseas lol,btohqsg
Nice wait but how about amazon uh,btohqsg
Amazon u can try..I don't buy much from amazon though,btohqsg
The language I buy for isn't popular in sg as Foreign language also üòÖ   is not Japanese Korean... that kind uh,btohqsg
Is considered rare so  getting the needed computer hardware is even more challenging,btohqsg
The ear piece has like 35 languages,btohqsg
I that time went to Russian school in sg to learn for short while,btohqsg
The ladies very nice ..u can ask them anything,btohqsg
But then recently they raised the fees üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
If not u find Ukraine friends to ask,btohqsg
ü§£ or khaz ppl also can,btohqsg
U can find them hanging around Clarke Quay areaü§£,btohqsg
Nice to see and hear from someone with similar experience in foreign language skill building,btohqsg
the image search feature is helpful af,btohqsg
oh yea also  the web ver of taobao has way more products than the app,btohqsg
And Google Chrome being your translator,btohqsg
So my family is reading newspaper articles and we came across this article of someone who is 76 who fell prey to Internet love scam üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
While being scam is a victim thing   I have no idea how will a 76 year old elderly to this type... the scammer claim he is a Ukrainian military service personnel and probably attracted her attention,btohqsg
She isn't mentally unsound at that point which makes me question her sanity,btohqsg
Wait I smell a rat here. I suspect AI deepfaking and translation AI was used so she gt convinced. In the future I think videos of unverified sources may not be used in court as evidence due to video being easy to manipulate.,btohqsg
Does NUS AU work same as NTU AU?,btohqsg
Like if NUS have 110 AU  and NTU have 110AU  is the work load say  comparable?,btohqsg
What exactly is the main point of double major in the future,btohqsg
I thought double major is exchanged with BDE?,btohqsg
Is ntu or nus Chem Eng better ahh,btohqsg
Nus Chem Eng is top in the world,btohqsg
But the employment is q bad,btohqsg
Whereas ntu Chem Eng employment is higher,btohqsg
does ntu second major have SU?,btohqsg
some argue there's employment benefits but personally I don't see much benefits. double degree is much more useful,btohqsg
I think you'll still have some bde but much lesser,btohqsg
but BDE are the SU right,btohqsg
but all my BDE is used for the second major alt,btohqsg
oh if udh BDE then means u can't SU any mods,btohqsg
but its all on data analytics,btohqsg
cause i second major data analytics,btohqsg
For 2nd major  can only su up to 12 aus,btohqsg
As long as they are not part of core,btohqsg
I assume you didnt know about flexible grading option too?,btohqsg
other courses have how many su,btohqsg
Like it just mean for your 2nd majors stuff overall can su 12 aus,btohqsg
In 2024  they decided to allow everyone to see grades first and then su,btohqsg
eh single major also 12 leh,btohqsg
Oh. That means most likely overall for single major can su up to 12 aus oso,btohqsg
for academics related qns and the intricacies of each course,btohqsg
btr to ask the profs and admission officers during open house,btohqsg
I nvr dare to overload HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
could have overloaded 1 mod but I scare I die,btohqsg
i doing max load this sem,btohqsg
if im not wrong single = double major in terms of au,btohqsg
it's just that for double major your bde is replaced with your second major modules,btohqsg
Don't worry i taking 19 au,btohqsg
i still dont get why second major is considered overload,btohqsg
analogue  digital  java and 3 cc technically,btohqsg
idt 2nd major is necessarily consideredoverload,btohqsg
you might just be doing higher load than others,btohqsg
what do yall learn in analogue and digital anw,btohqsg
why do you need an entire course for that,btohqsg
who y1 learn this kinda shit  even eee don't,btohqsg
they think you can do it,btohqsg
i only have 4 AUs of BDE i'm taking in school,btohqsg
ye same  I took last sem alr,btohqsg
gonna do mooc for the rest,btohqsg
Basically whatever uw from the shit long list of mods,btohqsg
hi guys ive some questions... could you help me with it?,btohqsg
"1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE):a. From my understanding  BDE courses are often graded as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U). For the second major in Data Analytics  I do not have the freedom to select other BDE courses and must follow the prescribed second major structure. Could you confirm if these BDE courses under the second major will still be graded S/U?b. I noticed that the total Academic Units (AU) for CCEB (single major) and CCEB + Data Analytics (second major) are similar. Despite this  I often hear that pursuing a double major significantly increases the workload. Could you explain why this is the case?2. Course Registration (STARS):a. Will I need to undergo the ""STARS Wars"" process to register for the second major courses in Data Analytics?3. Comparison Between Single and Double Major Programs:a. Could you provide a detailed comparison between the CCEB (single major) program and CCEB with a second major in Data Analytics in terms of:b. Total number of AUs required.c. How BDE courses are structured (i.e.  does the second major in Data Analytics fully replace my BDE requirements  and are they graded S/U?).4. Career Prospects:a. In terms of employability  how would I fare as a CCEB graduate with a second major in Data Analytics compared to students from the School of Computing with a more niche major? I‚Äôve heard that employers may favor Computing students for certain roles.5. General Insights on Single vs. Double Major:a. I came across the idea that a single major allows one to be highly specialized in one field  while a double major provides broader knowledge in two fields. Given this  I have some concerns:b. Why is a double major perceived to be more stressful if the focus is broader rather than niche?c. Why do double major students typically earn a higher initial salary compared to single major students  who presumably have deeper expertise in one area?",btohqsg
wow you are really overthinking a lot,btohqsg
1a) No  they are letter graded. S/U only apply if you apply the BDE as FGO. For 2nd major  you are required to use you BDE credits. However  12AU of those credits used for 2nd major can be S/U.,btohqsg
what job prospect do u think i suit then?,btohqsg
also not all AUs are created equal. 3 AUs in one major isn‚Äôt the same workload as in another major,btohqsg
so are the number of AU that I can get S/U same for double and single major in NTU?,btohqsg
then what do ppl mean by: second major is more stress  when its all the same,btohqsg
1b) The simplest explanation to explain single  double major and second major is basicallly a cake.A single major = 1 cakeA double major = 2 cakeA single major + 2nd major = 1 and a half cakesA single major + minor = 1 and a quarter of cakes.When I mean cake  assume 1 cake = number of courses taken by a single major you are required to take.In some cases  the modules may overlap  but roughly this is the simplest analogy I can give. It is just the number of courses/AUs.,btohqsg
yea i understand..im thinking between 1 cake and 1 1/2 cake,btohqsg
as in the total number of AU  and the S/U I can get,btohqsg
Of course there are rare cases od single major + 2nd major + minor.,btohqsg
And then there are also cases of single major + 2 minors,btohqsg
You have more core modules to clear while other people can explore more options with their BDE (I believe),btohqsg
from what i see now  its like: second major is exactly the same as single major just that the electives are chosen. grade wise its all the same.so why ppl don't choose second major?,btohqsg
nah i js thinking between single major  and second major.,btohqsg
so are my SU same as single major ppl?,btohqsg
i dont mind a bit more core modules,btohqsg
Because that is dependent on the school ans your course type,btohqsg
Plus it depends on if you want to put in a lot of effort,btohqsg
P.s. you cannot su your cores  only bdes,btohqsg
"It also explains why you wld technically have ""lesser"" aus for bde than a single major",btohqsg
Wait doesnt that mean they can just su their entire bde curriculum lol,btohqsg
When in actuality the 2nd major ppl use bde for 2nd major,btohqsg
They can only su up to 12 aus,btohqsg
Phms takes only 8 aus of bde,btohqsg
12su means you can s/u all 8 right,btohqsg
They are technically allowed to do that,btohqsg
so basically single vs second major js means I have more core mods  and my BDE is fixed.,btohqsg
As a 2nd majors  yeap  your bde will be fixed,btohqsg
so i can anyhow study my data analytics and js S/U that?,btohqsg
Most of the time you can req overload to 15,btohqsg
if u taking second major you can't su your second major,btohqsg
But why would you take more aus than required lmao,btohqsg
huh  but both single and second major have 12 SU AUs,btohqsg
so i can take some funny shit also right,btohqsg
Single Major u cannot SU your Core and MPE mods,btohqsg
my friend from biological science with second major in biomedical structural science say cannot su her mods,btohqsg
she won't get her second major,btohqsg
yuxuan ur friend how old sia,btohqsg
Yea only up to 12 AU,btohqsg
Rmb 2nd major is much more than 12 aus,btohqsg
and also she say if her gpa drop below 4.5 she won't be awarded the second major,btohqsg
12 aus to s/uBut your 2nd major is abt 30 aus approx,btohqsg
A second major has about 35AUs of load,btohqsg
You can also use bde for your own school,btohqsg
So you can only SU less than half of your second major stuff,btohqsg
If u take second major your BDE is usually gone,btohqsg
my friend only have 1 mod taken as bde for her 4 years,btohqsg
Yea  unless you are lucky like some ppl  using mods that are both for core and 2nd major,btohqsg
If it's a second major her second major would be classified under BDE,btohqsg
(Of course  another limit comes out),btohqsg
So she is doing her biological sci stuff mostly,btohqsg
she taking 7 core mod this sem,btohqsg
Remember even that is up to a limit of 6AUs,btohqsg
Last sem is 5 + 2 cc,btohqsg
she got basically no bde so far,btohqsg
That would mean she's not even doing the second major yet,btohqsg
2a) Yes. Sadly. Unless your are Y1Z1 or direct Y2S1 (poly batch usually),btohqsg
She's still doing the biological science part,btohqsg
Double Maj is not second major,btohqsg
Double maj pushes the stuff to MPE and core,btohqsg
so i have to properly study 35-12 AUs?,btohqsg
Double degree is a separate thing all tgt,btohqsg
what talking you- no way am i eating 2 cakes,btohqsg
wait so if i mess up my non-BDE subjects  and get super low AU  can I pull up using my BDE?,btohqsg
or can i pull up using my data analytics (BDE substitute),btohqsg
as long as u don't fail u will get your au la,btohqsg
Oh most don't do dbl degree,btohqsg
got many ways to get au,btohqsg
wait- then how about the grade ABCD,btohqsg
But also dbl degree your 5th year is not covered by TG,btohqsg
cuz it's a second proper degree,btohqsg
is there relationship between grade ABCD and AU?,btohqsg
Depends on what u wanna do lor,btohqsg
These ppl ask dbl degree i summoned u,btohqsg
ya then u sacrifice ur social life lor... no hall in Y3 lor...,btohqsg
to count how many mods or stuff u done in uni,btohqsg
Oh honey it gets more complicated than that,btohqsg
But the simpliest thing i can say is,btohqsg
If it is a 4au mod,btohqsg
omg whats the diff between GPA and AU,btohqsg
it's calculated based on your result like you said A B C D,btohqsg
AU is js sth for u to clear right,btohqsg
There's like 10 ways to get au,btohqsg
How s the load is another question,btohqsg
ya your core is the most important,btohqsg
Which idiot ask for dbl degree one ah,btohqsg
for me double deg probably be useless for career but i like econs,btohqsg
I summon the subject matter expert liao,btohqsg
so i still dont understand why second major not worth,btohqsg
I think double degree is more for career versatility,btohqsg
like a plus to your degree,btohqsg
u will mug like siao but i like what i mug so‚Ä¶,btohqsg
normally people won't look at it in detail,btohqsg
"Is not that ""it's not worth""  but if you cannot study kind  is more of ""i dont want to risk it""",btohqsg
youre double degree or double major,btohqsg
Anyways. Yes your 2nd major mods  you still have to do star wars btw,btohqsg
double deg stars wars very easy,btohqsg
so is second major it js a little bit more?,btohqsg
"I wld say ""a litttle bit more"" is more for minor",btohqsg
I wanted double degree with the TCM sia but,btohqsg
I scared I can't manage AHAHAHAHAHAAAHAH,btohqsg
so I end up in iem,btohqsg
2nd major is half of a single major core,btohqsg
I tried minor in sustainability but I got scammed,btohqsg
Then just take Chinese med lor,btohqsg
the school changed the minor requirement in AY24/25,btohqsg
I am 1 course left to completing my math minor,btohqsg
end up the bde I took,btohqsg
so core have both AU and GPAbde is js AU?,btohqsg
U could retroactively ask for it to be added,btohqsg
Letter based grades is considered in gpa regardless of bde or core,btohqsg
whether uw put your bde result inside your gpa not,btohqsg
but the max is 12au worth of bde,btohqsg
so if u use up the 12au the rest of your bde need to count into gpa,btohqsg
so BDE also  except for the 12 SU leeway I have,btohqsg
12 is so little leh omg,btohqsg
hehe I just mooc all the way,btohqsg
Is like 3 to 4 mods,btohqsg
Assuming each is 3 to 4 Aus,btohqsg
That's why we have fgo now :D,btohqsg
can help me with 4 and 5,btohqsg
oh yeah u take double deg u have almost no bde so almost no fgo. altho good thing is u can fgo all ur (very few) bdes lor,btohqsg
Actually 5 is very self explanatory,btohqsg
5b it's broader with the same depth5c double major students have the same expertise  they just add on additional stuff that is relevant tot heir industry (presumably),btohqsg
A double major means you have to take cores from both majors,btohqsg
Typically they have less bde  and hence  have limited choices in modules,btohqsg
It is an upgrade of su,btohqsg
but can see your result first,btohqsg
So now you can see result first before choosing to su,btohqsg
ur grade become pass fail so dont count towards gpa,btohqsg
im taking second degree  and i saw second degree and single major have 12SU AUs,btohqsg
I got a 0.13 increase in gpa from fgo-ing my bde last sem lol,btohqsg
im thinking between 1 and 1.5,btohqsg
for 5c  other than the fact that double major students are usually more able  on average  employers are willing to pay about 10% more if both majors are relevant to the job.,btohqsg
some small enterprises hardly look at second major as long as your degree match can alr,btohqsg
I think 4 is quite subjective,btohqsg
My dad's company is like that  the hr don't look at second major one,btohqsg
it's a plus la  but not too much,btohqsg
If the 2nd major boosts your single major; it may help,btohqsg
career prospects hard to tell tbh,btohqsg
Not saying is not possible to enter based on 2nd major uh,btohqsg
that one need you to find out yourself ü§£,btohqsg
But if you based on seeing all people wise,btohqsg
They wld definitely look into single major first,btohqsg
But even till then  is also about what work experiences you have also,btohqsg
"That's why ppl say comp sci graduates hard to find job because of ""oversaturation""",btohqsg
They have to actually show what makes them stand out,btohqsg
shld i get out of digital world,btohqsg
why sg job market suddenly liddat sia,btohqsg
thats why we shld go second major and do sth more broad?,btohqsg
yea chem eng can go healthcare sure stable one,btohqsg
then data analytcs can go computing (to be part of the hot topic now),btohqsg
Ok tbh i wldnt say to ignore the tech industry uh,btohqsg
then summore i wanna go hall council cause I need stay Y3,btohqsg
But tbh even in any science or industry,btohqsg
no need worry la until now I nvr even think about finding job yet,btohqsg
At some point  they require some sort of technology,btohqsg
I have. But i alr done intern anyways,btohqsg
u don't need hall council to stay hall,btohqsg
and how would data analytics  analysing shit help me,btohqsg
u just need wtv that gets u 7 or 9 poitns,btohqsg
im not fit enuf for varsity,btohqsg
join any club u like be a sub comm,btohqsg
and i heard nowayhome a lot of scam,btohqsg
there's other things apart from varsity,btohqsg
Want to go is one thing,btohqsg
I prefer go one corner and chill,btohqsg
Have to end up going is another,btohqsg
so i dont get hall 126,btohqsg
crespion has non aircon rooms too,btohqsg
year 1 just apply for aircon room,btohqsg
First ywar is only if you have a recee,btohqsg
If you are being recommended by a senior,btohqsg
u will randomly get allocated an aircon room,btohqsg
tanks guys for all ur guidance,btohqsg
ntu hall look like jungle and monkeys will steal ur shit,btohqsg
i saw two the other day LOL,btohqsg

U ask me if got Chinese,btohqsg
oh ya the tourists damn annoying,btohqsg
I tell u isn't that the point,btohqsg
i not in yet la i ease into NTU Chem eng+ data analytics,btohqsg
and the fking tourists stood IN THE MIDDLE OF ATHE ROAD TO TAKE PICTURE,btohqsg
eh rlly leh its damn jialat,btohqsg
i scolded a few of them,btohqsg
"""Oh sorry  we only want CHINESE SPEAKING tour guides""",btohqsg
but I know a lot of China scholars,btohqsg

"""Oh hi we want tour. Oh you not chinese speaking? Oh we take chinese speaking tour guides. We have our own  yall can just eff off""(not rlly like that but they effing just ditched us)",btohqsg
Oh mine go inside the class room,btohqsg
the tourist take pic of us in class sia,btohqsg

Tbf u can pass off as real monkey,btohqsg
I pass off as real gorilla,btohqsg
Thank god my lesson not in hive anymore.,btohqsg
King kong aint got nothing on you,btohqsg
Thank god i dont have to get out of spms anymore,btohqsg
if nus i got second major  vs ntu second major  which would be better ah,btohqsg
Not me being 45 mins late for my first hw lesson,btohqsg
I mean u use the stayc photo,btohqsg
u think which one is btr,btohqsg
Lestin is like the David to my goliath,btohqsg
Depends on what second major la,btohqsg
Yall know I have been effing sitting in this mrt train...,btohqsg
ntu weaves both majors tgt...but nus pro,btohqsg
Kns NUS got restricted second majors one,btohqsg
i doing data analytics as second,btohqsg
It has been roughly 1 hr and I am STILL on this train,btohqsg
have u considered getting off the train,btohqsg
Journey to the west is always long,btohqsg
I wld but like. I have to go pasir rizz,btohqsg
Why would u wanna go there,btohqsg
Man has been sitting on a seat,btohqsg
Can you still feel your ass,btohqsg
In fact can I feel your ass?,btohqsg
I come squeeze and plump it up for u,btohqsg
Aight thats it i dont want anything to do with you anymore,btohqsg
No I mean babe it's not what it looks like,btohqsg
Didnt i see you with some other person with dyed hair :0,btohqsg
OMG how could lestin do that,btohqsg
I'm the guy with dyed hair,btohqsg
I am the guy who dyed (died),btohqsg
Wait who has dyed hair then,btohqsg
Hello can I ask here if anyone here use Think! workbook for your E and A maths?,btohqsg
U have a query from it?,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/alfa-romeo-and-jeep-dealership-to-close-by-juneWhich brands do you think Komoco will bring in using the old dealerships?,btohqsg
My theories as to the potential candidates:1. Hongqi (FAW is the only one of the Chinese Big 3 to not yet have any presence in the Singapore market  or the Southeast Asian market as a whole. I expect that Hongqi would be popular amongst the rich Chinese set in Singapore)2. Leapmotor (Chinese EV brand with partial Stellantis ownership)3. Xiaomi Auto4. Genesis (Hyundai's luxury sub-brand)5. Vinfast (Vingroup has been INSANELY aggressive in terms of overseas expansion. Singapore might be a stepping stone to a bigger foothold in the Southeast Asian market outside Vietnam),btohqsg
guys i heard if you take Mechatronics or robotics diploma(poly)  its hard to find a job  Is it true?,btohqsg
If your education ends at a diploma  it will be hard,btohqsg
but what if i were to join Universities  would it be okay to apply for other engineering bachelors like Mech or Electronic engineerings,btohqsg
The field of Mechatronics/robotics is niche but there is demand.The prob is  there is not enough demand to the point they would choose someone whom has a diploma for most cases,btohqsg
if i take diploma in electrical and electronic engineering would it be better for the future jobs and education,btohqsg
More diverse field so yea I suppose,btohqsg
But triple EEE would be more desirable,btohqsg
Well honestly what you should be worried about is getting good gpa to get to uni  not the diploma that will get you to uni,btohqsg
With sufficient gpa you should be able to join anything you want,btohqsg
They have to consider whether AI can automate it lol,btohqsg
Same for university courses   certain degrees in the US has been less and less useful as time gonna pass,btohqsg
Psychology is okay   can still be a counselling team member,btohqsg
Biology can still help you prepare as hospital staff,btohqsg
you don‚Äôt do a psychology degree expecting to realistically work in psychology unless you do a masters,btohqsg
The rest he mentioned are indeed useless I think,btohqsg
biology is still ok bc industry labs have sufficient places but the ceiling is a bit low,btohqsg
Watch me study a physics degree but go do an office job like hr,btohqsg
but degrees that are more focused on the science itself (social science included) often have to rely more on the applied skills side to secure smth,btohqsg
If anyone going to USA to study  do your research first to prevent getting scammed by useless major course üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
My friend did bio in ntu...salary not gd..went to China do business üòü,btohqsg
No lah most Poly diplomas confirm can get job one,btohqsg
should i take triple E or mechatronics,btohqsg
i wanna try mech but my parents are forcing me to take triple e,btohqsg
do they teach the same things?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure ab mech,btohqsg
But EEE best Eng course in ntu,btohqsg
I think you should do what you like,btohqsg
Having to study something you didnt choose for yourself seems like a personal hell,btohqsg
EEE can switch to mechanical if work in similar industry,btohqsg
But eee got a lot of pathways tho,btohqsg
Ok my turnNTU Chem Eng + data analytics second majorOrNUS Chem Eng,btohqsg
Generally speaking engineering is a transferable skill,btohqsg
Job market for Eng rn is damn shit leh..,btohqsg
But yeah .... that's the issue,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why I switch to CCEB,btohqsg
So I can have chemical jic engineering fails me,btohqsg
I can go pharm sci all,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs my 2 cents worth la,btohqsg
idk if i should choose eng now,btohqsg
I tell uJob market rn is crap,btohqsg
Like I‚Äôm not going electricalBut ik some electrical stuff from CCEB,btohqsg
I had nightmare ytd night cause of it,btohqsg
I keep having nightmare over uni courses,btohqsg
what abt the job market for chemical eng,btohqsg
Js know ppl changing away petroleum,btohqsg
One of my choices is ExxonMobil,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs so farAnd next time if I fr get job thrThe sch choices for my kids (if have) very few,btohqsg
I js take all of these into consideration laPpl say I‚Äôm crazyüíÄüíÄ so don‚Äôt be too stress ab it,btohqsg
