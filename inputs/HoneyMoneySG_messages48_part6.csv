hi  wondering about adding youtrip into amaze to spend on overseas retail or overseas currency purchases. although youtrip itself has no rewards and is a prepaid card  but still able to take advantage of low fx fees and still get some insta points a not? hence becoming somewhat of a net gain?,btohqsg
no instapoints from topping up youtripbesides you can't link youtrip to amaze,btohqsg
ahhhhh soudesu  thank you Tan! :D,btohqsg
Anyone took part in this promo? Have you all received your CapitaMall vouchers from Citibank?,btohqsg
Hi. I understand that Citi Rewards+Insta Amaze and HSBC Revolution is the common strategy with miles  where you use the Citi Rewards for most spending  then only use HSBC Revolution for travel. But if let's say I spend an average of $500 with the occasional travel expense once a year  is it still worth it to get both cards? I'm afraid I won't be getting a lot of miles before the miles expires since my expenditure is spread to both cards  and the fees to transfer to a frequent flyer program ended up offsetting a huge chunk of what my mile was worth. Should I just stick to one e.g HSBC  then for the occasional travel expenses  use another general spending card like the Citi Cash Back+ card?,btohqsg
It really depend if u are a miles chaser  for me it is always cashback then miles.,btohqsg
You might want to consider UOB one card if can hit $500 consistently.If not your yearly miles of 24000 not enough for 1 sia flight.,btohqsg
$500 = > 4 x 500 miles = 2000 miles/per year.What are you planning to use the 2000 miles/per year?,btohqsg
I think u miss out by x 12  2000 miles is a month. 24k miles per year as stated by other.,btohqsg
Benny mentioned once a year travel expenses of 500 though,btohqsg
He mention monty average spend of 500 with occasional travel,btohqsg
So the based on citireward with amaze on monthl 500 is 2k miles. Occasional travel is on hsbc revo,btohqsg
Who can travel on 500 budget nowdays beside maybe go malaysia.,btohqsg
My based travel to thailand alao exceed 500 with airticket plus hotel.haha,btohqsg
Which statement indicate it is a monthly?,btohqsg
Anyway no card fit all  it is depend on lifestyle habit and spending  no matter who say which card is the best  it is still based on individual preference on miles and cashback  taking into consideration of conversion fee  point expiry,btohqsg
Go to branch is faster. I submitted online n after one week still no news. I went to branch n settle in one hour.,btohqsg
Do u need to trf the funds on the spot? Or can do it after the account is setup?,btohqsg
Preferably on the spot to ensure  the account is working. Maybe you need to get ready to transfer $1000.,btohqsg
Guys  any idea how to use US dollar to earn interest?,btohqsg
Yes  I spend about $500  sometimes below  sometimes above  so hitting the min $500 per month for some cards can be difficult  which is why cashback cards I'm limited to cards like Citi Cash Back+ since there's no minimum spending. But every year  I'll probably be going overseas  so at such instances  I can easily exceed $1k for hotels  flights etc. But I probably won't exceed $5000 in a year on travel  so if let's say I spread the $3000 travel expense over 3 months for HSBC (slowly book my hotels etc)  I'm not sure whether it's worth to use this Amaze (for non-travel related) and HSBC combo.Just some context  I‚Äôve just graduated  so I‚Äôm not paying housing bills yet  which is why it may be a little hard for me to hit min spending cards but am already earning my monthly salary. My objective is to earn as much ‚Äúreturns‚Äù on my expenditures  with a preference for miles  but of course if it‚Äôs not worth it due to my lifestyle  I‚Äôm open to cashbacks too,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I confirm. For the evol card. Online wallet top up is not counted ya?,btohqsg
I'm clocking for a specific card  not for EVOL ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Hi is citi rewards card master or visa,btohqsg
Evo buy e card from fave consider online ?,btohqsg
Master. Thats why can pair with amaze,btohqsg
HSBC Revo  CRMC have no minimum spend too. HSBC revo no fees as well. CRMC fee waiver is no biggie as well since you also have to waive ur Citi cashback +Miles can change for cashback (for HSBC revo) as well. Citirewards can also change for vouchers(?) etc. don‚Äôt see any harm in holding multiple  especially if you can get new to bank offers for HSBC revoJust some 2c**sry reply to wrong message,btohqsg
I just applied for it. For 1.2mpd for insurance payment. I won‚Äôt be spending 60k on it in a year. If they don‚Äôt waive the annual fee  can convert the points to miles first then cancel the card?,btohqsg
Hmmm but won't u also need to spend around 21k (21k / 1.2) to get 25000 points to change 10k miles in 1 yr?If Maybank also follow the usual bank point conversion.. unless Maybank has other airline points trf tt don't need 25000 min eh,btohqsg
My insurance spend is about 2k a month,btohqsg
Hi guys  any instarem amaze/ Trust card users know whether the credit card transaction fee (minus the one from the bank component) is excluded when used for hotel spend overseas? I came across one Melbourne hotel called Great South Melbourne Hotel and when booking on the site directly  after keying in the credit card details  they will mark up by 1.9% for Visa. Haven‚Äôt tried booking  but theoretically I think the deposit paid is X + 1.9%  will X + 1.9% be billed on either amaze/trust card or is it only X that is billed?Anyone got similar experience booking overseas hotels?https://greatsouthernhotel.com.au/great-southern-hotel-melbourne/,btohqsg
the hotel charge 2% for payment via mastercard  will be billed x+2%,btohqsg
Does this override what amaze/Trust card is doing  or amaze/trust trying to waive another component instead of that?,btohqsg
Amaze/Trust only waive the 2.5%-3.5% fx fee  this 2% is added on by the hotel for payment using mastercard/visa etc.,btohqsg
ok  so before all these Amaze/Trust card came into the picture  if one were to incur the 2.5% fx fee. Does that mean on the hotel billing page  it will show X + 1.9 but on the credit card bill it may be X + 1.9 + 2.5 or (X+1.9) * 102.5 in SGD?For simplicity I‚Äôm not including the exchange rate component or the extras being earned by amaze/trust,btohqsg
Any payment processor for Maybank visa card?,btohqsg

Hi  just want to ask if I received my income tax last month and I need to pay about 1k if I do a CPF contribution now will i get tax relief ?When is the best time(month) to top up cpf to get tax relief ?,btohqsg
cpf contribution this year is for tax relief next year,btohqsg
All tax relief via cpf must be done by December for the next year.,btohqsg
So if I want to get tax relief  (dw to pay tax) how much should I top up? Is there a website or calculator to check ?,btohqsg
Does that mean top up cpf in 2023 is to cover means Jan 2024 to Dec 2024  which is payable in May 2025?,btohqsg
If you are paying only $1k tax for the whole year  then forget about cpf topup. Wait until your taxes hit $5k and above then you can start to think about it.,btohqsg
No you top up in 2023 for the the tax payable in 2024 April. Nothing to do with 2025,btohqsg
