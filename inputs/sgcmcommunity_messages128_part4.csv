Even ChatGPT understands the rationale of de-escalating.,btohqsg
Got alot problems anot ah? I saw one depre 11k HAHHA,btohqsg
I think for Singapore hot temperatures  COE  service support industries  it’s better to buy Japanese/Korean cars  owners can renew 1x COE too  drive 20 yrs no problem,btohqsg
ya but from 2030 can only buy non ice cars,btohqsg
Continental cars costs a lot to maintain after 5 yrs,btohqsg
We will see  it’s a plan target… 😅😅😅,btohqsg
Simple petrol cars still most effective for normal drivers  not EVs,btohqsg
Singapore government not going to make EVs COEs cheap also…,btohqsg
Tbf.. nth is cheap in Singapore,btohqsg
Dear all. I gonna scrap my Toyota  thinking of getting a balance 2.5yrs Lexus.  Anyone  have any good lobang ?,btohqsg
go back BM preowned? for service support and preowned 👍👍 it’s more expensive though,btohqsg
With the way COE is increasing  it is just a matter a time that Cat A goes up to 100k as well.,btohqsg
don’t think like that bro  our lives are most precious to our love ones  our families! 🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
whole sg car markets waiting for elections  PM Lawrence Wong to do magic and score points in his first term as PM year 2025,btohqsg
Hmm... car buyers in SG are not showing any wait-and-see signs. In fact  the rising COE is one telling sign that that buyers are not waiting at all. 😅,btohqsg
ppl are thinking dun buy now gna go up higher,btohqsg
With that in mind  the only way for lay people to own a car is when there is some form of policy to limit the car ownership. 😁,btohqsg
adds in to the frenzy actually,btohqsg
Ok leh  then I got the rcz & 207cc  both issues came after the 7 yrs .,btohqsg
Upon reaching 7 yrs   time to sell . That my opinion on both,btohqsg
But my friend told me it is getting better now,btohqsg
But i aiming golf or i30 now,btohqsg
Oh the one i saw abt 6 years alr,btohqsg
got turbo means got more maintenance/service  😅😅😅,btohqsg
Anything above 1.5 is a killer...Buy one car for the price of two. 😅,btohqsg
Big EVs cars are highly expensive,btohqsg
Hi may i know the spare tire? If need to pump. Wat pressure shall that be,btohqsg
If you open your driver side door  got all the details at the side,btohqsg
Best check the spec at the driver side door.,btohqsg
COE rising is highly contributed by car sharing company,btohqsg
Why would you think that way,btohqsg
Oh ok. I thought only for the 4 normal tyres,btohqsg
Then if lower  touch wood you need to use,btohqsg
Then later you need to change  your driving will be damn weird,btohqsg
spare tire max speed 80km/h and only recommended to go for about 100km.. this was what i was advised on previously,btohqsg
best is dont drag go tyre workshop fix alr,btohqsg
Highly contributed ah? Any stats to show that car sharing companies bidding the COEs higher? 😮,btohqsg
See how many cars they dropping,btohqsg
just see number of bluesg x getgo x car rental companies also,btohqsg
they are bidding for the same coe quota as us.,btohqsg
idk if u recall  one good example is when blue sg released 500  opel for their users,btohqsg
prior to the news release  coe was rising non stop esp cat A also,btohqsg
2022 Sept 1st and 2nd round bidding 86 and 84k respectively. October 2022 81k and 80k respectively. Aug 1st and 2nd 80k and 87k respectively.,btohqsg
u dun buy 500 cars in 1 bidding eitherway. so its about 2 months back,btohqsg
It's ridiculous that a family who needs a car for the kids is competing with commercial operators. Time for feedback to MP that will be monitored,btohqsg
The “one car per family” thing people are saying is a stupid way to make COE prices drop,btohqsg
MPs won't side with us... 😅,btohqsg
