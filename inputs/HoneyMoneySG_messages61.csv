Hi  I have a quesI took a bus today (3 stops) and noted a difference when I use these 2 cards  not sure why thoPOSB debit card - 10 centsHSBC revo - 99 cents,btohqsg
the posb is a mastercard? Mastercard will batch the simplygo transactions by 5 days or $15 (I think  need to confirm) so the 0.10 is just a hold amount until accumulation is done.Visa is batched per day,btohqsg
Yeap Mastercard. Ohh interesting.. thank you!,btohqsg

Guys  i need an advice as it is my first time opening a saving account.After watching Honeymoney video  i am convinced to get UOB one saving acc + UOB EVOL.But the problem is  the new signup bonus for EVOL is only entitled to first 100. Imagine spending $1000 for 2months consecutively and i am not in the first 100 to get the $500 grab vouchers.Was just wondering what is everyone's opinion. Do you just ignore the new signup bonus because the interest rate of the saving acc is good enough?,btohqsg
If use UOB Amex card to top-ups to GrabPay Mastercard  do we still entitle to 1.7%?,btohqsg
Glad u know the whole gist of their marketing campaign....U shld know the answer already....,btohqsg
Spend $1 000 on 31 aug. Spend another $1 000 on 1 sep. If UOB don't give $500 grab voucher  call police 😂,btohqsg
🥲 sad sia..i guess it all balance out.Get lousier cashback card with $300 signup bonusGood cashback card with almost no chance of getting signup bonus.But the cashback difference might be able to cover the signup bonus in 1 year - 1 and half year,btohqsg
How long does it take for a payment  with Citi Rewards cr to go through,btohqsg

A side topic  but i am just wondering if i should signup for 2nd credit card.Local spending: $600/month on average.Uob one + EVOLBusiness Trip: 4 times a yearTotal Business expenditure: $2.8k (Hotel Booking + Oversea spending)Leisure Trip: 1 time a yearAverage spending: $3k-$4Based on this overseas expenditure  am i better off with another credit card? Or just use EVOL is okay.,btohqsg
Are you interested in miles at all? UOB Ladys and UOB Visa Signature might be useful for all the travel expenses.To me using cashback credit card for overseas expenses doesn't quite compute as they attract foreign currency fees (3.25%),btohqsg
I think UOB Lady can be used for guys now but i will feel awkward using it 😳But is it neccesary to get another UOB card? Since the interest from EVOL should be good enough.Was thinking of Citi Premier Miles since the miles will not expired.Krisflyer  i might find it tough to accumulate enough to redeem good stuffs within the expiry date. :(,btohqsg
Use Amaze + UOB Lady? Possible to cover your awkward ?,btohqsg
Dunno why need to be awkward.... The card hurting your masculinity or something?If all in UOB the miles are pooled. Citi premier miles definitely can't get you 6 miles per dollar.But well find a card that doesn't make you feel awkward I guess,btohqsg
Oh yeah!! I saw that combo too in the video. Thanks for reminding,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion :),btohqsg

Hi all  got an ILP running with high fees (learn about it way too late..)Account value 75k now. Surrender only get 21k. Should surrender? Got 24 more years to go,btohqsg
do u want to pay 24 more years of high fees?,btohqsg
Any reason? Out of the 75k  $32 400 was the start up bonus,btohqsg
That is why I will ask haha,btohqsg
For me it is a definite yes  whatever u lose by surrendering today will be way lesser than the 'extra' fee u pay for the next 24 years,btohqsg
If we are talking about capital loss  it’s about 25k because I did some withdrawal before,btohqsg
It is just sunk cost. Just surrender and cut loss. Btw not financial advise. I talking to myself. 😁,btohqsg
Oh then nvm  ignore what I said,btohqsg
look at their projections in the original doc  compare against how it has performed thus far to have a rough gauge of how reliable their projection is.if not  make your own projections.with that you can calculate the expected apy returns (with considerations to your premiums too) from now till policy matures.Compare against available options now  for me I'd just use UOB One's 5% p.a. as a quick benchmark.You can make the decision easier with the numbers laid out,btohqsg
If the returns after deducting fees are very low  idt it's worth imoIf the ILP allows fund switch  great as you may invest in better funds (greater returns)If the returns after deducting fees are still e.g. 8%/10%  you can consider keeping it,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Just wanted to ask. Does OCBC 360 account have fall below fees? Even after holding for the account for more than 1 year.,btohqsg
Not familiar with your ILP. Can’t comment much.a). Do you mean you pay $75k n the actual value left $21k if surrendered orb). you pay $46k n value left $21k  loss $25k? Orc). you have pay $75k and the value left $21k+$29k(have withdrawn)  loss $25k?,btohqsg
Visa better simply go a it updated dailye,btohqsg

Hi i just had this experience in July  where i did not get my UOB One bonus interest because of a refund. The spend transaction ($2000) was in June  but refund posted in July  so it offset my July spending (~$950)  resulting in a balance amount. Based on that  UOB deemed that i didnt fulfil July's $500 eligible spend. Currently waiting the appeal result,btohqsg

what are the best cashback card for insurance + telco and tax giro payment?,btohqsg
Oh no… so actually they apply the refund minus amount to refund month? 😱 Pls keep us updated once any updates. Thx 🙏,btohqsg
Banks usually count posting date instead of transaction date  for example  transaction at 30 June but posted at 1 July  then counted as July transaction.,btohqsg
Applies to the month of refund. E.g. Canceled July purchase and Received refund in Aug $50  need to spend $550 to hit the $500 requirements in Aug,btohqsg
Same rules apply to EVOL cash back also ($600/statement month)?,btohqsg
Hi! New to the CC game. Where do I check the exact date my card resets monthly for earning boosted points?,btohqsg
Isnt that clear that you can’t get interest on your july spending as such,btohqsg
How can it accrue to your june spending. Sounds quite silly,btohqsg
Insurance and Telco  Amex TCB. Telco  SC Simply Cash. All 1.5%  might have others higher for Telco.,btohqsg
how about tax? all the ipaymy etc doesn't seem to worth it,btohqsg
Tax payments with processing fee seems more for miles card  as 1.5-2% cashback cards can barely cover the fee charged.,btohqsg

I recently made a MYR charge (haircut) on Maybank FnF and it is reflected under other spending. Wouldn't it be eligible for 8% cashback under MYR spending? Min spend has been reached,btohqsg
Oic. About 30% loss. Then you need to see if you can make $25k using $$58k in next many years.,btohqsg
Category fulfillment and the MYR promo are 2 different things. If you spend at Msia supermarket  it will fulfil your grocery category.  you will see a separate MYR CASHBACK row later in the month,btohqsg
Hi  can ask if cimb 3.5% rate is for 6 months only?,btohqsg
The haircut charge is not part of my 5 categories so will I still see a separate MYR cashback row?,btohqsg
According to the CSO  he said that it will still fall under other spending but for the MYR transaction 8% cashback will be applied which I find the application process quite weird,btohqsg
Yes. I have a MYR charge which is outside of my 5 cat too. And I got the MYR cashback separately,btohqsg
Ah ok. I guess it’s not reflected for me yet as per the screenshot,btohqsg
In the statement itself.. it’s a separate promo,btohqsg
ahhh the cash back is reflected in the statement not in TREATS app,btohqsg
Hi all  I just receive my uob debit card. But I do not have an acc for their tmrw app. Will they give me or I need to register myself?,btohqsg

Not sure🤣 can’t tell for sure,btohqsg
Do excel  compare the projections for the ILP vs you buying the same funds using platform like ifast/poems.See worth to surrender or not 😂,btohqsg
Hi all  I’m planning to get an everyday card to get 4mpd. Will you guys recommend Citi rewards + amaze or HSBC revolution is better? What are their pros and cons,btohqsg
Hi anyone know where to check which transactions qualified for the cashback for uob evol?,btohqsg
I know amaze has no Apple Pay  HSBC revolution can use Apple Pay?,btohqsg
citi reward MUST pair with amaze card in order to get the full potential. In addition to that travel and hotel is excluded from reward  so you have to use a secondary card to cover that. The only reason how Citi Reward + amaze could be better than HSBC is you go overseas very often and you use Citi reward + Amaze for overseas spending...,btohqsg
Previously Amaze unofficially allow users to add the card to Apply Pay. But they quickly revert back. So now at we least know it's on the way  not just say say only.,btohqsg
"And one important thing to take note. This overseas spending would work because Chris calculated his cost per mile to be 1.25 cents per mile. So that worked out to be 5% ""cashback"". As Amaze has about 2-2.5% spread. That's how he still able to earn ~3% with amaze on overseas spending. So in order for you to benefit from citi reward + amaze  you need to calculate what is your CPM.Watch this video to find outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faKTziNGHGI&t=417s&ab_channel=Chris%40HoneyMoneySG",btohqsg
That’s including the “cashback” from using amaze card overseas from points accumulation?,btohqsg
If you really want to surrender policy  can try approaching those companies that buy over Ilp. They may give you more than the official surrender value from the insurance company. I did that once  with a prudential policy..,btohqsg
hi hi! sorry am new to all these  wdym by buying over an ILP?,btohqsg
sorry to butt in. But recently one agent of my wife introduced some form of unit trust kind of product which gives out dividends on monthly basis with sales charges of about 2.5% which actually we can purchase the fund itself thru poems or other platforms.However after asking more. It seems nowadays ILPs had been repackaged kind of into so called unit trusts purchases and FOC rebalancing with the insurance company itself that is managing?,btohqsg
Which company did u go to? I asked. Mostly they take life insurance,btohqsg
No company take over ILPs. Only life insurance,btohqsg
Think they sell ur units to keep paying 'dividends'. Investmentmoat has an article on it  u can read it to find out more. And even if u wan to buy  dont buy from agent or bank. Go through endowus. No sales charge and lower recurring fees,btohqsg
Thanks. Yah was thinking about the downside of it.,btohqsg
Buy from endowus  they give you back the trailer fees and charge you a fixed fee that is lower. Every time I get charged by endowus and then see that the rebate I get back is higher than their charges  I feel good.,btohqsg

Hello everyone I recently registered my credit cards (Citi Cashback+ and SC SimplyCash) with MoneySmart and SingSaver. I'm considering linking these two cards to the InstaReM Amaze. If I use the Amaze card for online purchases (like on Shopee  Lazada  or the Apple Store website) to earn points  will I still qualify for the sign-up rewards (such as cash or items) from SingSaver and MoneySmart? There's a minimum spend of $500 to earn these rewards  and I'm unsure if binding with Amaze and use Amaze card to pay will  affect this eligibility ? thank you.,btohqsg
Thank you. In additional   is there any better way other than binding with Amaze?,btohqsg

depends  how much miles you can get vs how much cashback and how much u value miles. But miles cards usually have higher caps,btohqsg
Not sure if this helps  but last year I had used OCBC best senior credit card to make major appliance purchases 12/24 months installments. You get cashback/OCBC points even if it’s installment.But if not wanting to limit to Best Denki  Atome may be the best choice.,btohqsg

It's not like a bank. Briefly saw their booth at Seedly Personal Finance Fest and from conversation looks abit like an investing tool (didn't ask too much),btohqsg
In their website mentioned regulated by MAS,btohqsg
why not used credit card pay telco directly?,btohqsg
looks like regulated Micro Financer then..my opinion is that even though legit.. the returns are not high enough to justify taking on 'small business risk'put in CIMB at 3.5% p.a. seems way more worth it to me.,btohqsg
There are no guarantees in life. Our portfolio is structured to deliver 4.5% p.a. return on your first S$20k and a target 3.5% p.a. on any amount thereafter. However  If we don't make the target 4.5% p.a. for your first S$20k  we will top up the difference to make sure you enjoy the target return. Does it get any better than that? For amounts above S$20k  we target 3.5% p.a. Your return is a money-weighted rate of return. We advise that 3.5% p.a. is not guaranteed andthere is a potential for capital losses. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future performance.,btohqsg
looks like they take the money and put into short term bonds and give you 3.5-4.5% and earn the difference.,btohqsg
If like tat might as well take the money and put in money market fund??,btohqsg
The likelihood of fullerton running away is def smaller than them running away,btohqsg
u sure they put your money into bonds? or they take the money and lend out to companies who don't qualify for bank loans?,btohqsg
Pay directly No miles right ?,btohqsg
U are no insured if the company wind up just so u know only bank deposit are sdic protected for first 75k,btohqsg
If u put 100k in uob one won't the extra 25k is not protected?',btohqsg
not sure but from what they described  it's my guess.,btohqsg
yes but its uob so the confidence level is different compared to a new fintech start up.,btohqsg
By right it won’t happen. The only thing it happen is the collapse of Singapore government,btohqsg
heh heh to me it is a LOSE LOSE situation.If indeed they take your money and buy bond funds  you can do so yourself  WHY PAY THEM?If indeed they take your money and lend to lousy companies  the risk is not worth the returns. WHY DO IT?so TLDR: no to chocolate for me.,btohqsg
i can guarantee you that if you put $100k into UOB and UOB goes bankrupt  you will get back $100k.$500k and above i cannot say with such certainty la.. haha,btohqsg
The money will go straight to the top 20 billionaires,btohqsg
I would like to inform you that no depositor of Credit Suisse has lost a single cent.,btohqsg
Yes. But because it is being bail out. But it did have risk 😂,btohqsg
pretty sure if Credit Suisse went bankrupt  their depositors would still not lose a single cent.,btohqsg
Risk Bro. Not happening in the past does not mean futures.,btohqsg
CS bought over by UBS. This include bad debts also.,btohqsg
He mention 0 risk apart Singapore being takeover. . But it does have 0.00000001% risk,btohqsg
0.000000000001% risk sounds lower than putting cash under a pillow,btohqsg
From the back of my mind  without googling  among developed countries  i think only Cyprus Bank depositors ever lost money,btohqsg
Ya. I just anyhow say. But anyway there is a risk too. Just minimums. Good practice of Risk management. Of course only if you really rich then u shld spread out different bank in different countries.,btohqsg
Then yes. Also I think svb  cayman branch depositor money  also all gone.,btohqsg
heh heh.. arguably SVB Cayman is not a developed country bank leh..separate legal entity,btohqsg
Yes. But showcase example of Risk.,btohqsg
You not their citizen. They can just take your money. 😂 Especially in today context. US and Russia  example.,btohqsg
Yeah man.. i would be wary to put money into funny countries...,btohqsg
Of course all this issue only you are multi-millionaire close to billionaire then u shld worry. We just chat only.,btohqsg
pretty sure if i converted SGD into rubles i would be multi millionaire 🤣,btohqsg
Cayman island good place to avoid tax. 😂 U think the sum of svb deposit will be small?,btohqsg
thankfully singapore is very tax friendly.. we don't need to funny things and still keep within the law,btohqsg
Just check the news is svb cayman island deposit $14Billions being seized by fdic,btohqsg
See how US play the game. 😂,btohqsg
What’s the risk of collapse of Singapore government?,btohqsg
Any incremental fresh funds above 31/7/23 balance will earn 3.5% till 31/1/24 (for existing account holders only),btohqsg
Please read T and C carefully  my view is that it is not as difficult as HSBC EGA 👍🏻,btohqsg
Hi all. Slightly confused with the current 5mpd fcy promotion for UOB KF CC. If I pair with amaze  then it's not consider FCY  right? So  I should just use the KFCC directly abroad  right?,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm thinking to cancel my dbs altitude card since my annual fee waiver is rejected (don't use that much anymore since started using citirewards + amaze combo)Should I cancel right away thru digibot?,btohqsg
must pay the 3.25% FX fee to be under this promo...,btohqsg
So deposit 10k into cimb  10k will earn 3.5 percent every month till 31jan24?,btohqsg
So  it's not worth the 3.25% for the 5MPD?,btohqsg
depends on your valuation of a mile.For me  i feel it is VERY WORTH paying the 3.25% to get 5mpd for General Spending.,btohqsg

Amaze with lady (category restriction) or Citi (1k limit) seems much better6/4 mpd respectively at ~1% feeUnless the caveats are an issue,btohqsg
yeah 5mpd paying 3.25% fee is more for General Spending... i.e. outside of the UOB Lady 6mpd categories paired with Amazeunless of course.. another category (which was discussed in another chat coincidentally)... if company reimbursed...,btohqsg
Feel bad for you man legit hope you got your money back,btohqsg
Kind of an eye opener to lock / cancel unnecessary card,btohqsg
Anyone have experience with DBS Vickers? Will like to sign up for one but kana error cause i using POSB Cashback bonus,btohqsg
Anyone know of a method to draw cash from card ? If can I want to pay a small fee or no fee at all. I tried to search for uob link atm but can't find anything.,btohqsg
AYO ONE MORE MEMBER WE HIT 9K,btohqsg
u know will have 24% p.a. interest hor,btohqsg
That one I know other than revolut I don't know which one should I do,btohqsg
If sg gov collapses  your greatest worry is unlikely to be the status of your funds in uob (or whatever sg bank),btohqsg
I'd like to confirm the interest calculation scenario: If I have a remaining balance of 1 000 SGD in July and make a deposit of 10 000 SGD on Aug  would the interest be calculated as follows? 10 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?For the subsequent month  if I again deposit 10 000 SGD  would the interest be computed as: 20 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?,btohqsg
Should be according to the following calculations:Aug interest: 11k x 1.5% x (31/365) + 10k x 2% x (31/365)Sep interest: 21k x 1.5% x (30/365) + 20k x 2% x (30/365),btohqsg
Is this for new or existing user?,btohqsg
Chocolate Finance | A new place for your spare cashhttps://www.chocolatefinance.com/,btohqsg
I have no idea sorryJust see also,btohqsg
Hi anyone bought funds from OCBC to get extra interest on OCBC 360? Is there any holding period on the fund?,btohqsg
Nope. Chocolate Finance is not a bank. It is a managed account operated by Havenport Investments Pte. Ltd. Havenport is a Holder of a Capital Markets Services Licence and an Exempt Financial Adviser  regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore with a license number of (CMS100173).,btohqsg
Only things guaranteed in life are death and taxes,btohqsg
I would be worried if anyone guaranteed returns ala Bernie madoff,btohqsg
Lol. Do they say that it's guaranteed,btohqsg
quick question if you pair UOB lady and citi rewards card with the amaze card and pay using the amaze card  does it mean that both will be credited? or how does it work?,btohqsg
u have to choose the CURRENT LINKED CARD,btohqsg
ahh okok so i can just keep switching between those 2 card with the app whenever?,btohqsg
You can try and see 😂,btohqsg
They just try to gain popularity by burning investor money.,btohqsg
So on their part they'll guarantee the interest rates. Wonder how sustainable this is,btohqsg
0.7% different compared to mmf. [if they use it to Fullerton funds],btohqsg
Just like gxs type. Maybe one month or 2 month. Because they smaller.,btohqsg
Wonder if they'll start charging for managing money in time to come. After all  they're a fund manager,btohqsg
Are there any advantages/perks to choosing Amex Ascend KrisFlyer over other cards like Citi + Amaze? Feel like cancelling my Amex now that the exclusions are similar to others,btohqsg
Nothing. It's good for sign up bonuses only,btohqsg
So possible to cancel after we receive the bonus right,btohqsg
Plus is there a reason to believe that Citi won’t nerf the amaze route?,btohqsg
*Hi all*I would like to ask you a few questions regarding *money market fund*.1. Which broker is the easiest/better to use in your view ?2. Does the interest paid daily ?3. Can I withdraw it all anytime without penalty?,btohqsg
There would be clawback clause if close immediately after getting the bonus,btohqsg
Right now Citibank knows about it but choose to close 1 eye cause currently it how they still have a market share in current market over their competitor like DBS WWMC and HSBC Revo and UOB PPVThey know themselves that once they closed off amaze  people would immediately drop this card and favour WWMC due to higher limit and travel category,btohqsg
What is the best mile cc to use for big tickets items such as car servicing beyond 1k?,btohqsg
Thanks  why do you feel Webull is better? And if you don’t mind ti share how exactly am I buying it?,btohqsg
hi guys  for things like wedding spendings( photoshoot  gown  venue etc) are these classes as general spending?) what cashback credit card is best for those big ticket items? evol doesn't really work right since the 8% are quite specific categories? Is HSBC revo a good option?,btohqsg
Webull UI is clean and straightforward unlike TIGER which has too many unnecessary informationAnd Webull tracks and shows u your everyday gainsTo buy  just Auto subscribe via moneybull,btohqsg
Lastly  webull don't offer you mmf choices... They only have fullerton sgd and fullerton usdI feel TIGER offers you too many unnecessary choices and might mislead you to the not so good mmf... Ie. The rate u see now is super good but very short term... Goes back to crap rates after a while,btohqsg
the question is do your vendors accept credit card?,btohqsg
Good qn.. not sure also. Will be attending a wedding fair on 27/28 so will go check it outBut say if the venue is hotel/restaurant- then they are just classed as general spending or is it dining etc?,btohqsg
restaurant in hotel usually classed as travel (under the hotel),btohqsg
Hi all! I am making a big travel spending next few months  would lady solitaire be better or the uob one card? Appreciate all advice!,btohqsg
Thanks  what’s your opinion on moomoo?,btohqsg
Thanks! Just wanted to make sure,btohqsg
Just found that HighFlyer will exclude education and non-profit related transactions from 1 Oct 2023…,btohqsg
Hi  do you earn 6mpd if you pay for food at Kopitiam using FairPrice app linked to lady card (dining category selected)?,btohqsg
Is there cash balance sweep for ibkr? Can't seem to find it,btohqsg
Hi all  how do I see the latest HSBC EGA interest rates?,btohqsg
I cannot find them on HSBC website anymore,btohqsg
I have an unconventional suggestion. ocbc nxt card. It splits up your bulk payments into 6 months installments and you can put the money in a high yield savings account like UOB ONE to earn extra interest. The extra interest may be higher than cashback from credit cards like Citibank Cashback plus and amex tcb,btohqsg
EGA no more promo since July :(,btohqsg
I dug through the app and web portal but can't find the option to enroll,btohqsg
Hi guysFor moomoo Fullerton money market fund  when will I see the interest coming in? Any specific time of the day ??,btohqsg
May i check for existing user CIMB 3.5% interest rate  just use whatsapp to register?,btohqsg
You can go to Accounts > More > Revenue. You can see the Fullerton Cash Fund credited daily there.,btohqsg
Seems like need to  according to website,btohqsg
Yes if you are existing CIMB user as per website,btohqsg
For MooMoo. I can't set price i want to sell or buy out of range.2 dollar share   and I can't even set as gtc at $5 to sell? .,btohqsg
Hi   I have put in money and subscribed last night  I still don’t see anything credited.,btohqsg
Any other platform without such restrictions? Tiger or Webull?,btohqsg
If you subscribe last night  it will probably appear this evening.,btohqsg
Oh I see  how can I be sure that I have subscribed ?,btohqsg
Sorry can anyone help on this? I just deposited 10k and over the course of a few days deposited about 30k  why is it that today there’s a negative PL though it still states I have the total amount I put into cash plus?,btohqsg
What is going on here? Can anyone advise?,btohqsg
You will receive the statement from MooMoo via email.,btohqsg
Else you can go to Accounts > Assets > Funds you should see Positions column will show how much Fullerton Cash Fund you subscribed.,btohqsg
I cant see any under assets,btohqsg
Hi all Can I use Citi rewards card and UOB lady’s card concurrently? will the miles points be affected  or can I just convert my UNI$ and Citi rewards into the airline point ie KrisFlyer points and use it together?,btohqsg
Yes but do note each has a minimum number of miles to transfer to KF miles so check your spending habits if you can effectively redeem both of them at the end,btohqsg
Yes  although that's just a few months of spending lol,btohqsg
Mine doesn't show. Is yours under ibkr sg or ibkr llc?,btohqsg
Mine is llc too. Can try view your activity statement to confirm?,btohqsg
I have a joint account that was only allowed under LLC. So it should be that. If I had SG  this sweep option wouldn't be possible  from what I know,btohqsg
May I ask for OCBC 360 account if amount > $100K  what is the interest?  The website only showing amount with max $100K.  Thanks.,btohqsg
Is HSBC Everyday+ program still ongoing? I checked their website and it seems so. However  after doing the required tasks on 1 Aug  I have yet to receive SMS on participation for Aug and Sep,btohqsg
Which UOB credit card should I apply for men?,btohqsg
There is a calculator on website. You can enter the amount > $100k n see how much you get.,btohqsg
does UOB one account still give high interest rates? and does bank tranfer of funds every month from my DBS to UOB (under salary) still count for interest rate calculation?,btohqsg
You can apply any uob card. The card shall best fit your daily spending pattern or expenses. Tabulate your expenses n see which one suite you the most.There is no one card that best fit everybody.,btohqsg
I see. I spend close to $600 a month on food and online shopping,btohqsg
I like their interface the best compared to GXS and Trust. Don't like the fact that you can't save payees on GXS when transferring money,btohqsg

Anyone faced failed remittance with Instarem to Korea after waiting for a few days? Ridiculous “Instant” remittance,btohqsg

If you have $100k n would like to earn high interest 5%  Can find out uob Evol or uob One paired with uob one saving account.,btohqsg
I have a UOB one account. Might consider UOB one CC since UOB Evol needs to keep track of what you spend on while UOB One can just spend on anything and earn interest,btohqsg
Read the TnC before applying. Wish you good luck in earning high interest.,btohqsg
Hi  for M1  Zym mobile and Geneco. Which cc best for cashback ?,btohqsg

Hi all  if I have $70 cashback in my Citi Cashback card. In order to meet the min. spending this mth  should I spend $800 or $870? Many thanks!,btohqsg
$800. It counts spending only. Also better spend either $875 or $1000 to get $70 or $80 cashback (in multiples of $10 only),btohqsg
5 Fast transfers out and a transfer in of 5k. Also a lot of GIRO deductions,btohqsg

The GIRO are those that you submitted hardcopy GIRO form for bill payment n not those self initiated GIRO.4). Those transactions are not in exclusion list. Correct?,btohqsg

Thank you for the information. Will check it out as well :),btohqsg
I just applied for it but I’m not clear if spending on travel merchants through kris+ payment counts towards the 1k spend for 2 months   so hoping someone here is able to help clarify,btohqsg

I'm wondering also  from the website it just click and redirect me to whatsapp for registration,btohqsg

Yes. On 1 Aug  I Fast out to other bank accounts 5x. Since Fast transactions already satisfied the requirements  GIRO transactions don't really matter.I think it's due to the 5K FAST into EGA account. I forgot to do it on 1 Aug. So I did that from another bank Fast into EGA 3 days ago. Maybe the SMS will be sent soon.Anyway  I'm still covered for August month since it's eligible for 2 months. This time is just to cover September. So can afford to wait.Thanks,btohqsg

Hi experts  may I know what does it mean by buy hold sell ? if they say $1.40 buy means can buy the shares till $1.40? how about sell and hold?,btohqsg
Buy means buy as their expected price is whatever they are saying. Hold means hold whatever you have. Sell means sell as they are expecting a price drop,btohqsg
In your example  dbs expects price to go to 2.45  so they're asking you to buy at current price. Whereas OCBC thinks it will go down to 2.05  so they're asking you to sell at current price,btohqsg
Take all of these analyst advice with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
I see thanks   trying to understand what do they mean,btohqsg
So those indicators are based on current vs their expected to tell u if u should buy sell or hold right,btohqsg

Dca at index 80+ to 90% percentile hmmmm....,btohqsg
What would be your expected salary bump after masters? There are no guarantees in investment btw,btohqsg
I am still quite young  so I think I can afford to take risk. Boss say master won't effect salary in the short term.,btohqsg
Ok. What is short term? Also  why do you want to do the masters?,btohqsg
In the industry of tech but don't have relevant degree. A master in cs would pay off in the long run.,btohqsg
Ok so u don't care about the short term anyway. That's fine. If you're sure of getting a higher return than 4.38 pa by DCA  then go for it.,btohqsg

Where do you see this screen from?,btohqsg
Go bank in person others bank still have,btohqsg
hrm..so anything with 5XUNI is your bonus category ?,btohqsg
yeah that’s my thinking too. so suppose my travel earns 100 uni$  wouldn’t bonus be 500 uni$? can’t see the breakdown so it’s challenging to know how it’s derived :/,btohqsg
🤔 ok thanks  probably call CSO to check if can request. If not go bank branch on Monday.,btohqsg
5x is 5xNon-5x is 9xTotal 14x,btohqsg
Can I check for the citi rewards and amaze pairing  if I use amaze to book air tickets  does the 4mpd still works?,btohqsg

strange for mine.  my bonus category is fashion. I paid using amaze paired with UOB ladys to make payment. The mcc code as confirmed by UOB is correctly tagged to fashion MCC but my uni$ is only showing as normal . It did not say UOB Ladys Card Uni - Fashion. Instead it only stated AMAZE*ZaloraSG. Does amaze work with UOB ladys to gain bonus?,btohqsg
need to wait for the next month before the lump sum uni$ is collated,btohqsg
No  the mcc code is still travel which is excluded by CRMC,btohqsg

This is why we need to work for our own Financial Independence through legal/ethical/safe ways and not think of getting rich fast. Once you are able to generate a sustainable source of income apart from the day job  you will then worry less about money and fall into greed/scam things.,btohqsg
But sometime it is just pure kidnapped or spike into drink etc if in thai  laos  [worst myanmar] etc. So still need to be very careful. Even if rich.,btohqsg

I fund the account only on Mar and May  when I put money in  I don't take it out and it is a large sum. I am getting less than half of my expected amount.,btohqsg
It is stated on CIMB website. You may want to visit website to understand more on this.,btohqsg
Hi sifu  you can try to get what is your ADB for each of the promo months from their live chat in the app. Once you have those figures  you can do counter check with what you received?,btohqsg
I think no cap  unlike SCB eSaver = $2mil,btohqsg
Chris  correct me if I am wrong?,btohqsg
Did you sms to register the promo?The interest will be credited into your accounts using few transactions across 1-2 weeks.  wait till month end then you will know the final amount.,btohqsg
I registered SMS once  the Mar 2023 bonus interest programme was for 4 months. I have only seen the first deposit  if it is for the first month of the four months  then it is about right. 😂,btohqsg
It is for 1st month only. 3 to go,btohqsg
Morning guysDoes anyone know if purchases at fortytwo website qualify for 10x cash back for OCBC titanium card?,btohqsg

Need to understand the definition of spending and outstanding bill. The two amount have different meaning.,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to check what is the mcc code of Fortytwo. You can search usinghttps://heymax.aiThen check OCBC Titanium TnC is it in whitelist.,btohqsg
Thks so much. Code is 5712. Not in the list. However  Ikea (also 5712) is included in their list,btohqsg
1). Use digibot to check what is the mcc codehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/701192). Check is the mcc code in the credit card exclusion list.,btohqsg

Hi guys  I’ve been using 2 credit cards for 2-3 years and want to cancel one of them to apply for another one. Will this affect my credit score?Concerned cos I’ve planned for a big purchase next year and will prob need a bank loan. I’m just not sure how soon is too soon that risks affecting credit score when applying for another card. Any advice appreciated!,btohqsg
Had frequent credit check mentioned in my credit report . But since I pay off everything every month credit remained excellent. Probably will impact in some way if you are not in all clear status .,btohqsg
The cash rebate is equivalent to your payment to settle your outstanding bill. It will not affect your total spending amount. You must hit minimum qualified spend every month to get cash rebate.I m more interest on how your spend exactly $500 every month on your credit card.😀,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming.. the $500 is just an example 🤭,btohqsg
just apply one card no impact,btohqsg
Thanks Julie. I also pay my bills pretty much on time. Just that I hardly use the other card that I want to cancel.The credit report u got is from the credit bureau for $8++ right?,btohqsg
if u applied card from another bank  u should get a free credit bureau report,btohqsg
Oh! I'll try ask  thanks for this 🙂,btohqsg
Yeah   he is right . When you apply and approve   you will get it free .. so it’s good to ‘apply for a card ‘ before you seek mortgage… :),btohqsg
Just keep the card   the good score from the less used card also help esp if it is held longer .,btohqsg
This card is mcc specific  doesnt matter which payment method,btohqsg

Puzzle how Citi rewards and amaze work,btohqsg
So once we link we can use amaze to pay wave all items from hawker supermarket electric store challenger ntuc guardian Watson all will enjoy the Citi rewards x10?,btohqsg
add citi rewards card to Amaze in instarem app  select citi rewards as the linked card  use Amaze card for any transactions so long mcc not excluded from 10x points,btohqsg
yes capped fot $1k in statement month,btohqsg
So if hospital excluded can't Earn,btohqsg
refer to Citi rewards card TnC.,btohqsg
So as long as MCC included can earn x10: by pay wave,btohqsg
hospital mcc not excluded. Travel related excluded  in top of other common exclusions,btohqsg
Think city rewards is MC can too up grab without fee,btohqsg
Same as others just need to have no fee will be good,btohqsg
Fave pay link Citi rewards for points or link amaze after Linkin Citi rewards get points from citi ?,btohqsg
both same  get online 10x points so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg

Hi guys  can check if CRMC + Amaze can earn 4miles for bills and utilities?,btohqsg
Think 🤔 Citi rewards no min sum need to spend,btohqsg
Check Mcc for Citi rewards didn't say pay to see doctor so it's excluded?,btohqsg
Cause I remembered a few years back  if you have some form of affiliation like savings account or something  you won’t be entitled for the gift.,btohqsg
no min spend  points awarded per $1 spend per transaction,btohqsg
refer to the TnC for the promo,btohqsg
So it's up to 1k spend total like HSBC Revo,btohqsg
yes  citi rewards by statement month  hsbc revo by calendar month,btohqsg
pay doctor not in excluded mcc  so not excluded,btohqsg
depends what bill  utilities mcc excluded,btohqsg

I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Lady hawker” to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
It's more of the other payment apps like xnap  shopback etc but not NTUC app to pay for dining more than $5.,btohqsg

Kopitiam payment by ntuc app is fast food mcc 5814. Will get 6 mpd with uob lady's solitaire.Those who are searching for this in future. This is a confirmed datapoint.,btohqsg

The priority is to live the best life in the remaining time. I wouldn't recommend UOB One 5% too since it needs some management that an 18 y/o may not understand.

A person may need to buy maximum $100k of insurance(if the person is still allowed to buy)  this allows the fund can be disbursed to beneficiaries immediately if have will.Once a person pass away  all money/bank accounts n assets will be locked/freezed until the letter of administration/grant of probate is obtained. During this period  the dependents need to use their own saving to pay for any expenses.If can’t buy insurance  may need to have a separate arrangement  not sure bank joint account will help.You may need to consult lawyer who is specialised on this.The idea is the dependents can still have access to fund to pay for any expenses.,btohqsg
.... She already have cancer....cannot buy insurance already..... Not sure u write this for what.....,btohqsg

Harvey Norman under mcc5732 not eligible for UOB lady’s category. I signed up for ocbc titanium 4mpd capped at 13.3k per year  good for HN  best Denki  gain city  ikea etc (think audio house not counted). 13k should be good enough for most appliances.,btohqsg
If I have keppel bills  will uob one still be able to provide cashback for this provider? Or does it only work for SP?,btohqsg
Audio house can pay with Kris pay,btohqsg
Anyone can advice if I go Citibank CDM can I pay for my credit card bill? Will the payment be reflected immediately,btohqsg
I am referring to my older order 😂,btohqsg
Hi all  to check on maybank family and friends credit card. If I choose data and teleco as one of my categories and I am doing recurring payment through telco to credit card  will it consider as data telco categories and get 8% if I hit minimum $800,btohqsg
do UOB ONE CARD have installment plan for puchase with 0% ?,btohqsg
only for some merchants that can do that during payment. Dun count to card rebate/ one account bonus interest though,btohqsg
count to tiered spending for quarterly rebate,btohqsg
My altitude credit card fee waiver was rejected twice (because I've been using citi+amaze) . Should I give up and cancel it?,btohqsg
is it your only dbs card? you have any use case for this card? points redeemed already?,btohqsg
Hi. Any tax implications with uob one paynow sala?,btohqsg
Never had that happen before  u never use at all? I hardly use altitude now and they still waive,btohqsg
Hi guys  a quick qn  i know about the promotional rates of  SCB esaver and withdraw after the promotional period ends (aka when bonus interest comes in)  can i have 2 accounts of esaver at the same time? like 1 personal and 1 joint-acc? to take advantage of the new promotional period if SCB decides to continue... thanks,btohqsg
Never used at all for 3months haha. Still havent redeemed the voucher though. Only used it for flight and hotel...,btohqsg
instarem amaze with CRMC can get points with goFood delivery ?i saw the transaction labeled as travel 🥲,btohqsg
I didnt use much longer and i still got waiver i think they dont like you that is why. They probably want u to leave DBS,btohqsg
Try calling in to dbs Hotline and speak to cso to appeal credit card fee waiver,btohqsg
Anyone knows what does the $3 daily cap imply? For posb everyday,btohqsg
Isn't it quite self explanatory. The daily $ is the rebate you get. Max you get $3 rebate per calendar month. What part is not clear?,btohqsg
U can have 2 e-savers ac. The second ac doesn’t even need to be a joint account; it could be another single e-savers ac,btohqsg
i see  so at the start of the next promotional period i just open a new e-saver account under my own name and transfer from the old one (via another bank)? Is there any other requirement aside from the 1k minimum,btohqsg
I don’t think so but u can read the t&c carefully again,btohqsg
Should be safe. As long as under Lazada is fine. Just remembered insert OCBC Titanium card directly for payment. Don't use Amaze.,btohqsg
can you combine different credit card miles points together? like uob ladys and citi rewards pooled into one area,btohqsg
hi  is there any other card that offers cashback for nets app top up other than amex TCB?,btohqsg
Yea you combine it into your Krisflyer account,btohqsg
Did not realise youtrip can now be added onto iphone,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + citi rewards for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
Youcan  but... is that really what you're asking?,btohqsg
Haha just figuring out the best/efficient ways to benefit from public transport,btohqsg
Ok. what are you asking exactly? You can use it. But it doesn't earn you 4mpd  which I have a feeling is actually what you wanted to know about,btohqsg
I see. Yeah I was just wondering the most efficient/best way to earn from bus/mrt,btohqsg
Yup  but that will end EOY. Hopefully they continue with the benefits,btohqsg
hi all  anyone can share what i can do with my idle USD cash in MooMoo? Is there any sort of funds or some Stuffs that i can try to gain some interest?,btohqsg
Put in fullerton usd money market fund??,btohqsg
Until they ended up hehe extra %,btohqsg
Enjoy while It lasted they extended end of 2023 if they stopped the extra % then need to look elsewhere,btohqsg
For hsbc revo  the rewards points can only redeem for miles? Or can redeem for cashback?,btohqsg
Both but idk which one is bang for the buck,btohqsg
From uob website it state phone bill for uob evol is 0.3% while from Chris video it mention 6.67%. Is it only when I pay starhub via recurring I will earn 0.3% while if I make one time payment via the starhub website I will earn 6.67% online spend?,btohqsg
Hi guys  the 40 000 Citi Ty points is after $800 spending  how long will it take to appear after meeting the criteria?,btohqsg
Hi Champs  can u guys let me know how I can redeem HSBC Revo points to Krisflyer? I can’t find much feature on HSBC Sg app?,btohqsg
Should I do it on online banking?,btohqsg
Is it right to say the diff between HSBC advance credit card and HSBC revo is as follows?:Both at 2.5% cashback. But for HSBC advance  need to spend >2k to work.Then HSBC revo is capped at $1k/mth and has the versatility to convert points to either miles or cashback.So in summary  hsbc advance credit is better for bigger ticket item every mth.,btohqsg
Yeah basically your own spending habit dictated which card actually better for you ~,btohqsg
For uob lady card  the points only can convert to miles?,btohqsg
check tmrw app. can redeem rewards etc also i think!,btohqsg
Uni dollar can be use for miles  cashback or other merchant voucher. But miles will have most cp value if redeem for biz flight,btohqsg
Someone mentioned in the group before have to keyword search  takes awhile to find haha,btohqsg
For hdb season parking renewal  is using giro the best way? It will have a 2% discount,btohqsg
Try HSBC reward website. Not all functions are available on apps..See below.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/travel-and-leisure/,btohqsg
Because the bonus is based on transaction description and amaze changes that,btohqsg
Cuz it's transaction name specific. I tried before using amaze and no bonus given.,btohqsg
TR if it fits the whitelisted mcc,btohqsg
Need to subscribe for 1 year conversion and pay,btohqsg
Yes  amaze is useless in this case,btohqsg
Does anyone know when OCBC 360 grow and salary bonus requirements are captured? I want to move funds out to another account but want to maximize the interest earned.They usually credit the bonus interest into my account around the 10th every month,btohqsg
clear your points before cancelling the altitude card. 1 year later   then reapply for new signup gifts,btohqsg
Login to to your account using ocbc web to find out. Example can be found on ocbc 360 website.,btohqsg
Between these two  will be hsbc revo,btohqsg
Depend if u want to save on fcy fee or u can get 4mpd on uob visa signature for foreign currency spend when u spend at least 1k and cap at 2k spending,btohqsg
Hi guys  i want to add some REIT to my investment. I thinking to buy Nikko AM ETF as it is a basket of REIT. I looked at the chart it look very worrying to me. Should i stock pick for REIT or buy ETF?,btohqsg
Yes giro at 2% is best now after GPMC was nerf,btohqsg
hi i’ve just got my very first hsbc revo card statement. it says in the restatement that 277 points are expiring. how does it come about? why would pts expire in hsbc revo? 😅,btohqsg
expire in 3 years. Aug 2026.,btohqsg
i tot points in hsbc revo won’t expire one? am i missing sth :/,btohqsg
ooops hahaha thanks for letting me know 🤣,btohqsg
One more thing. Need to pay $40 for mile redemption per transfer unless you subscribe yearly n pay yearly.,btohqsg
It appears to be so but wait for HDB to come out with the details ba,btohqsg
Idunno...its public housing... Gotta live by govt rules... Otherwise it's condo,btohqsg
its like the whole system is assuming a lot of things to go smoothly for a young couple…i.e. graduate at 22/24  after 5 years salary max out at 14k for the couple  just nice 27/29 can still have baby and thus a house is ready for u,btohqsg
Of coz mah  birth rate dropping so crazily  how can we incentivize singles,btohqsg
Looks like more than $14K income for resale can buy Standard and maybe Plus  no Prime.,btohqsg
Govt wants to be incentivising people to have kids  not singles who yolo,btohqsg
They are only limiting to those Prime HDB.. normal HDB no income ceiling restriction for resale,btohqsg
Previously singles are only limited to non-matured estate.. now no restrictions,btohqsg
Also hard to get those better location. Just bring hope only.,btohqsg
Guess they knew the single going to vote opposition party. Faster do it before 2025. 😂,btohqsg
At least they are building singles' flat there  last time only at ulu locations.. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Now 30plus I guess about 40% is single. I think they knew it is serious losing vote.😂,btohqsg
40%?!?!? Where got so much? Most people should be married by that age,btohqsg
We need to set up arranged marriages like in India  seems to work out for them  even though that is personal rather than govt sanctioned,btohqsg
Drastically Declining birth rate can mean the end of singapore,btohqsg
End of the world actually. universe 25 experiment,btohqsg
Eh for EGA Bonus interest do they pay it out in one shot?,btohqsg
So will reflect as multiple bonus interest? Okay then shall wait longer. They have till 31 Aug I guess...,btohqsg
helloo  how much of my salary should i set for investing ETF such as S&P500?,btohqsg
Just Google search Or see youtube video first. Yr qn too general.,btohqsg
