the posb is a mastercard? Mastercard will batch the simplygo transactions by 5 days or $15 (I think  need to confirm) so the 0.10 is just a hold amount until accumulation is done.Visa is batched per day,btohqsg
Yeap Mastercard. Ohh interesting.. thank you!,btohqsg

Guys  i need an advice as it is my first time opening a saving account.After watching Honeymoney video  i am convinced to get UOB one saving acc + UOB EVOL.But the problem is  the new signup bonus for EVOL is only entitled to first 100. Imagine spending $1000 for 2months consecutively and i am not in the first 100 to get the $500 grab vouchers.Was just wondering what is everyone's opinion. Do you just ignore the new signup bonus because the interest rate of the saving acc is good enough?,btohqsg
If use UOB Amex card to top-ups to GrabPay Mastercard  do we still entitle to 1.7%?,btohqsg
Glad u know the whole gist of their marketing campaign....U shld know the answer already....,btohqsg
Spend $1 000 on 31 aug. Spend another $1 000 on 1 sep. If UOB don't give $500 grab voucher  call police üòÇ,btohqsg

A side topic  but i am just wondering if i should signup for 2nd credit card.Local spending: $600/month on average.Uob one + EVOLBusiness Trip: 4 times a yearTotal Business expenditure: $2.8k (Hotel Booking + Oversea spending)Leisure Trip: 1 time a yearAverage spending: $3k-$4Based on this overseas expenditure  am i better off with another credit card? Or just use EVOL is okay.,btohqsg
Are you interested in miles at all? UOB Ladys and UOB Visa Signature might be useful for all the travel expenses.To me using cashback credit card for overseas expenses doesn't quite compute as they attract foreign currency fees (3.25%),btohqsg
I think UOB Lady can be used for guys now but i will feel awkward using it üò≥But is it neccesary to get another UOB card? Since the interest from EVOL should be good enough.Was thinking of Citi Premier Miles since the miles will not expired.Krisflyer  i might find it tough to accumulate enough to redeem good stuffs within the expiry date. :(,btohqsg
Use Amaze + UOB Lady? Possible to cover your awkward ?,btohqsg
Dunno why need to be awkward.... The card hurting your masculinity or something?If all in UOB the miles are pooled. Citi premier miles definitely can't get you 6 miles per dollar.But well find a card that doesn't make you feel awkward I guess,btohqsg
Oh yeah!! I saw that combo too in the video. Thanks for reminding,btohqsg

Hi all  got an ILP running with high fees (learn about it way too late..)Account value 75k now. Surrender only get 21k. Should surrender? Got 24 more years to go,btohqsg
do u want to pay 24 more years of high fees?,btohqsg
Any reason? Out of the 75k  $32 400 was the start up bonus,btohqsg
That is why I will ask haha,btohqsg
For me it is a definite yes  whatever u lose by surrendering today will be way lesser than the 'extra' fee u pay for the next 24 years,btohqsg
If we are talking about capital loss  it‚Äôs about 25k because I did some withdrawal before,btohqsg
It is just sunk cost. Just surrender and cut loss. Btw not financial advise. I talking to myself. üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh then nvm  ignore what I said,btohqsg
look at their projections in the original doc  compare against how it has performed thus far to have a rough gauge of how reliable their projection is.if not  make your own projections.with that you can calculate the expected apy returns (with considerations to your premiums too) from now till policy matures.Compare against available options now  for me I'd just use UOB One's 5% p.a. as a quick benchmark.You can make the decision easier with the numbers laid out,btohqsg
If the returns after deducting fees are very low  idt it's worth imoIf the ILP allows fund switch  great as you may invest in better funds (greater returns)If the returns after deducting fees are still e.g. 8%/10%  you can consider keeping it,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Just wanted to ask. Does OCBC 360 account have fall below fees? Even after holding for the account for more than 1 year.,btohqsg
Not familiar with your ILP. Can‚Äôt comment much.a). Do you mean you pay $75k n the actual value left $21k if surrendered orb). you pay $46k n value left $21k  loss $25k? Orc). you have pay $75k and the value left $21k+$29k(have withdrawn)  loss $25k?,btohqsg

Hi i just had this experience in July  where i did not get my UOB One bonus interest because of a refund. The spend transaction ($2000) was in June  but refund posted in July  so it offset my July spending (~$950)  resulting in a balance amount. Based on that  UOB deemed that i didnt fulfil July's $500 eligible spend. Currently waiting the appeal result,btohqsg

what are the best cashback card for insurance + telco and tax giro payment?,btohqsg
Oh no‚Ä¶ so actually they apply the refund minus amount to refund month? üò± Pls keep us updated once any updates. Thx üôè,btohqsg
Banks usually count posting date instead of transaction date  for example  transaction at 30 June but posted at 1 July  then counted as July transaction.,btohqsg
Applies to the month of refund. E.g. Canceled July purchase and Received refund in Aug $50  need to spend $550 to hit the $500 requirements in Aug,btohqsg

Category fulfillment and the MYR promo are 2 different things. If you spend at Msia supermarket  it will fulfil your grocery category.  you will see a separate MYR CASHBACK row later in the month,btohqsg
Hi  can ask if cimb 3.5% rate is for 6 months only?,btohqsg
The haircut charge is not part of my 5 categories so will I still see a separate MYR cashback row?,btohqsg
According to the CSO  he said that it will still fall under other spending but for the MYR transaction 8% cashback will be applied which I find the application process quite weird,btohqsg
Yes. I have a MYR charge which is outside of my 5 cat too. And I got the MYR cashback separately,btohqsg
Ah ok. I guess it‚Äôs not reflected for me yet as per the screenshot,btohqsg

Hi anyone know where to check which transactions qualified for the cashback for uob evol?,btohqsg
I know amaze has no Apple Pay  HSBC revolution can use Apple Pay?,btohqsg
citi reward MUST pair with amaze card in order to get the full potential. In addition to that travel and hotel is excluded from reward  so you have to use a secondary card to cover that. The only reason how Citi Reward + amaze could be better than HSBC is you go overseas very often and you use Citi reward + Amaze for overseas spending...,btohqsg
Previously Amaze unofficially allow users to add the card to Apply Pay. But they quickly revert back. So now at we least know it's on the way  not just say say only.,btohqsg
"And one important thing to take note. This overseas spending would work because Chris calculated his cost per mile to be 1.25 cents per mile. So that worked out to be 5% ""cashback"". As Amaze has about 2-2.5% spread. That's how he still able to earn ~3% with amaze on overseas spending. So in order for you to benefit from citi reward + amaze  you need to calculate what is your CPM.Watch this video to find outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faKTziNGHGI&t=417s&ab_channel=Chris%40HoneyMoneySG",btohqsg
That‚Äôs including the ‚Äúcashback‚Äù from using amaze card overseas from points accumulation?,btohqsg
If you really want to surrender policy  can try approaching those companies that buy over Ilp. They may give you more than the official surrender value from the insurance company. I did that once  with a prudential policy..,btohqsg
hi hi! sorry am new to all these  wdym by buying over an ILP?,btohqsg
sorry to butt in. But recently one agent of my wife introduced some form of unit trust kind of product which gives out dividends on monthly basis with sales charges of about 2.5% which actually we can purchase the fund itself thru poems or other platforms.However after asking more. It seems nowadays ILPs had been repackaged kind of into so called unit trusts purchases and FOC rebalancing with the insurance company itself that is managing?,btohqsg
Which company did u go to? I asked. Mostly they take life insurance,btohqsg
No company take over ILPs. Only life insurance,btohqsg
Think they sell ur units to keep paying 'dividends'. Investmentmoat has an article on it  u can read it to find out more. And even if u wan to buy  dont buy from agent or bank. Go through endowus. No sales charge and lower recurring fees,btohqsg
Thanks. Yah was thinking about the downside of it.,btohqsg
Buy from endowus  they give you back the trailer fees and charge you a fixed fee that is lower. Every time I get charged by endowus and then see that the rebate I get back is higher than their charges  I feel good.,btohqsg

Hello everyone I recently registered my credit cards (Citi Cashback+ and SC SimplyCash) with MoneySmart and SingSaver. I'm considering linking these two cards to the InstaReM Amaze. If I use the Amaze card for online purchases (like on Shopee  Lazada  or the Apple Store website) to earn points  will I still qualify for the sign-up rewards (such as cash or items) from SingSaver and MoneySmart? There's a minimum spend of $500 to earn these rewards  and I'm unsure if binding with Amaze and use Amaze card to pay will  affect this eligibility ? thank you.,btohqsg

Not sure if this helps  but last year I had used OCBC best senior credit card to make major appliance purchases 12/24 months installments. You get cashback/OCBC points even if it‚Äôs installment.But if not wanting to limit to Best Denki  Atome may be the best choice.,btohqsg

Hi guys  has anyone heard of Chocolate Finance  interest rate looks enticing üßê,btohqsg
Does Citipayall allowed to pay for my internet bills and the data ?,btohqsg
It's not like a bank. Briefly saw their booth at Seedly Personal Finance Fest and from conversation looks abit like an investing tool (didn't ask too much),btohqsg
In their website mentioned regulated by MAS,btohqsg
why not used credit card pay telco directly?,btohqsg
looks like regulated Micro Financer then..my opinion is that even though legit.. the returns are not high enough to justify taking on 'small business risk'put in CIMB at 3.5% p.a. seems way more worth it to me.,btohqsg
There are no guarantees in life. Our portfolio is structured to deliver 4.5% p.a. return on your first S$20k and a target 3.5% p.a. on any amount thereafter. However  If we don't make the target 4.5% p.a. for your first S$20k  we will top up the difference to make sure you enjoy the target return. Does it get any better than that? For amounts above S$20k  we target 3.5% p.a. Your return is a money-weighted rate of return. We advise that 3.5% p.a. is not guaranteed andthere is a potential for capital losses. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future performance.,btohqsg
looks like they take the money and put into short term bonds and give you 3.5-4.5% and earn the difference.,btohqsg
If like tat might as well take the money and put in money market fund??,btohqsg
The likelihood of fullerton running away is def smaller than them running away,btohqsg
u sure they put your money into bonds? or they take the money and lend out to companies who don't qualify for bank loans?,btohqsg
Pay directly No miles right ?,btohqsg
U are no insured if the company wind up just so u know only bank deposit are sdic protected for first 75k,btohqsg
If u put 100k in uob one won't the extra 25k is not protected?',btohqsg
not sure but from what they described  it's my guess.,btohqsg
yes but its uob so the confidence level is different compared to a new fintech start up.,btohqsg
By right it won‚Äôt happen. The only thing it happen is the collapse of Singapore government,btohqsg
heh heh to me it is a LOSE LOSE situation.If indeed they take your money and buy bond funds  you can do so yourself  WHY PAY THEM?If indeed they take your money and lend to lousy companies  the risk is not worth the returns. WHY DO IT?so TLDR: no to chocolate for me.,btohqsg
i can guarantee you that if you put $100k into UOB and UOB goes bankrupt  you will get back $100k.$500k and above i cannot say with such certainty la.. haha,btohqsg

From the back of my mind  without googling  among developed countries  i think only Cyprus Bank depositors ever lost money,btohqsg
Ya. I just anyhow say. But anyway there is a risk too. Just minimums. Good practice of Risk management. Of course only if you really rich then u shld spread out different bank in different countries.,btohqsg
Then yes. Also I think svb  cayman branch depositor money  also all gone.,btohqsg
heh heh.. arguably SVB Cayman is not a developed country bank leh..separate legal entity,btohqsg

So deposit 10k into cimb  10k will earn 3.5 percent every month till 31jan24?,btohqsg
So  it's not worth the 3.25% for the 5MPD?,btohqsg
depends on your valuation of a mile.For me  i feel it is VERY WORTH paying the 3.25% to get 5mpd for General Spending.,btohqsg

I'd like to confirm the interest calculation scenario: If I have a remaining balance of 1 000 SGD in July and make a deposit of 10 000 SGD on Aug  would the interest be calculated as follows? 10 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?For the subsequent month  if I again deposit 10 000 SGD  would the interest be computed as: 20 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?,btohqsg
Should be according to the following calculations:Aug interest: 11k x 1.5% x (31/365) + 10k x 2% x (31/365)Sep interest: 21k x 1.5% x (30/365) + 20k x 2% x (30/365),btohqsg

So on their part they'll guarantee the interest rates. Wonder how sustainable this is,btohqsg
0.7% different compared to mmf. [if they use it to Fullerton funds],btohqsg
Just like gxs type. Maybe one month or 2 month. Because they smaller.,btohqsg

There would be clawback clause if close immediately after getting the bonus,btohqsg
Right now Citibank knows about it but choose to close 1 eye cause currently it how they still have a market share in current market over their competitor like DBS WWMC and HSBC Revo and UOB PPVThey know themselves that once they closed off amaze  people would immediately drop this card and favour WWMC due to higher limit and travel category,btohqsg

Webull UI is clean and straightforward unlike TIGER which has too many unnecessary informationAnd Webull tracks and shows u your everyday gainsTo buy  just Auto subscribe via moneybull,btohqsg
Lastly  webull don't offer you mmf choices... They only have fullerton sgd and fullerton usdI feel TIGER offers you too many unnecessary choices and might mislead you to the not so good mmf... Ie. The rate u see now is super good but very short term... Goes back to crap rates after a while,btohqsg
the question is do your vendors accept credit card?,btohqsg
Good qn.. not sure also. Will be attending a wedding fair on 27/28 so will go check it outBut say if the venue is hotel/restaurant- then they are just classed as general spending or is it dining etc?,btohqsg

I cannot find them on HSBC website anymore,btohqsg
I have an unconventional suggestion. ocbc nxt card. It splits up your bulk payments into 6 months installments and you can put the money in a high yield savings account like UOB ONE to earn extra interest. The extra interest may be higher than cashback from credit cards like Citibank Cashback plus and amex tcb,btohqsg

Hi experts  may I know what does it mean by buy hold sell ? if they say $1.40 buy means can buy the shares till $1.40? how about sell and hold?,btohqsg
Buy means buy as their expected price is whatever they are saying. Hold means hold whatever you have. Sell means sell as they are expecting a price drop,btohqsg
In your example  dbs expects price to go to 2.45  so they're asking you to buy at current price. Whereas OCBC thinks it will go down to 2.05  so they're asking you to sell at current price,btohqsg
Take all of these analyst advice with a pinch of salt,btohqsg

It is stated on CIMB website. You may want to visit website to understand more on this.,btohqsg
Hi sifu  you can try to get what is your ADB for each of the promo months from their live chat in the app. Once you have those figures  you can do counter check with what you received?,btohqsg

Chris  correct me if I am wrong?,btohqsg
Did you sms to register the promo?The interest will be credited into your accounts using few transactions across 1-2 weeks.  wait till month end then you will know the final amount.,btohqsg
I registered SMS once  the Mar 2023 bonus interest programme was for 4 months. I have only seen the first deposit  if it is for the first month of the four months  then it is about right. üòÇ,btohqsg

Firstly  you need to check what is the mcc code of Fortytwo. You can search usinghttps://heymax.aiThen check OCBC Titanium TnC is it in whitelist.,btohqsg
Thks so much. Code is 5712. Not in the list. However  Ikea (also 5712) is included in their list,btohqsg

Hi guys  I‚Äôve been using 2 credit cards for 2-3 years and want to cancel one of them to apply for another one.

I‚Äôm just not sure how soon is too soon that risks affecting credit score when applying for another card. Any advice appreciated!,btohqsg
Had frequent credit check mentioned in my credit report . But since I pay off everything every month credit remained excellent. Probably will impact in some way if you are not in all clear status .,btohqsg
The cash rebate is equivalent to your payment to settle your outstanding bill. It will not affect your total spending amount. You must hit minimum qualified spend every month to get cash rebate.I m more interest on how your spend exactly $500 every month on your credit card.üòÄ,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming.. the $500 is just an example ü§≠,btohqsg
just apply one card no impact,btohqsg
Thanks Julie. I also pay my bills pretty much on time. Just that I hardly use the other card that I want to cancel.The credit report u got is from the credit bureau for $8++ right?,btohqsg
if u applied card from another bank  u should get a free credit bureau report,btohqsg
Oh! I'll try ask  thanks for this üôÇ,btohqsg
Yeah   he is right . When you apply and approve   you will get it free .. so it‚Äôs good to ‚Äòapply for a card ‚Äò before you seek mortgage‚Ä¶ :),btohqsg
Just keep the card   the good score from the less used card also help esp if it is held longer .,btohqsg

Cause I remembered a few years back  if you have some form of affiliation like savings account or something  you won‚Äôt be entitled for the gift.,btohqsg
no min spend  points awarded per $1 spend per transaction,btohqsg

If I have keppel bills  will uob one still be able to provide cashback for this provider? Or does it only work for SP?,btohqsg
Audio house can pay with Kris pay,btohqsg

count to tiered spending for quarterly rebate,btohqsg
My altitude credit card fee waiver was rejected twice (because I've been using citi+amaze) . Should I give up and cancel it?,btohqsg
is it your only dbs card? you have any use case for this card? points redeemed already?,btohqsg
Hi. Any tax implications with uob one paynow sala?,btohqsg

Hi guys  a quick qn  i know about the promotional rates of  SCB esaver and withdraw after the promotional period ends (aka when bonus interest comes in)  can i have 2 accounts of esaver at the same time? like 1 personal and 1 joint-acc? to take advantage of the new promotional period if SCB decides to continue... thanks,btohqsg
Never used at all for 3months haha. Still havent redeemed the voucher though. Only used it for flight and hotel...,btohqsg
instarem amaze with CRMC can get points with goFood delivery ?i saw the transaction labeled as travel ü•≤,btohqsg
I didnt use much longer and i still got waiver i think they dont like you that is why. They probably want u to leave DBS,btohqsg
Try calling in to dbs Hotline and speak to cso to appeal credit card fee waiver,btohqsg
Anyone knows what does the $3 daily cap imply? For posb everyday,btohqsg
Isn't it quite self explanatory. The daily $ is the rebate you get. Max you get $3 rebate per calendar month. What part is not clear?,btohqsg
U can have 2 e-savers ac. The second ac doesn‚Äôt even need to be a joint account; it could be another single e-savers ac,btohqsg
i see  so at the start of the next promotional period i just open a new e-saver account under my own name and transfer from the old one (via another bank)? Is there any other requirement aside from the 1k minimum,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so but u can read the t&c carefully again,btohqsg
Should be safe. As long as under Lazada is fine. Just remembered insert OCBC Titanium card directly for payment. Don't use Amaze.,btohqsg
can you combine different credit card miles points together? like uob ladys and citi rewards pooled into one area,btohqsg
hi  is there any other card that offers cashback for nets app top up other than amex TCB?,btohqsg
Yea you combine it into your Krisflyer account,btohqsg
Did not realise youtrip can now be added onto iphone,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + citi rewards for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
Youcan  but... is that really what you're asking?,btohqsg
Haha just figuring out the best/efficient ways to benefit from public transport,btohqsg
Ok. what are you asking exactly? You can use it. But it doesn't earn you 4mpd  which I have a feeling is actually what you wanted to know about,btohqsg
I see. Yeah I was just wondering the most efficient/best way to earn from bus/mrt,btohqsg
Yup  but that will end EOY. Hopefully they continue with the benefits,btohqsg

From uob website it state phone bill for uob evol is 0.3% while from Chris video it mention 6.67%. Is it only when I pay starhub via recurring I will earn 0.3% while if I make one time payment via the starhub website I will earn 6.67% online spend?,btohqsg

Hi Champs  can u guys let me know how I can redeem HSBC Revo points to Krisflyer? I can‚Äôt find much feature on HSBC Sg app?,btohqsg
Should I do it on online banking?,btohqsg
Is it right to say the diff between HSBC advance credit card and HSBC revo is as follows?:Both at 2.5% cashback. But for HSBC advance  need to spend >2k to work.Then HSBC revo is capped at $1k/mth and has the versatility to convert points to either miles or cashback.So in summary  hsbc advance credit is better for bigger ticket item every mth.,btohqsg
Yeah basically your own spending habit dictated which card actually better for you ~,btohqsg
For uob lady card  the points only can convert to miles?,btohqsg
check tmrw app. can redeem rewards etc also i think!,btohqsg
Uni dollar can be use for miles  cashback or other merchant voucher. But miles will have most cp value if redeem for biz flight,btohqsg
Someone mentioned in the group before have to keyword search  takes awhile to find haha,btohqsg
For hdb season parking renewal  is using giro the best way? It will have a 2% discount,btohqsg
Try HSBC reward website. Not all functions are available on apps..See below.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/travel-and-leisure/,btohqsg
Because the bonus is based on transaction description and amaze changes that,btohqsg
Cuz it's transaction name specific. I tried before using amaze and no bonus given.,btohqsg
TR if it fits the whitelisted mcc,btohqsg
Need to subscribe for 1 year conversion and pay,btohqsg
Yes  amaze is useless in this case,btohqsg
Does anyone know when OCBC 360 grow and salary bonus requirements are captured? I want to move funds out to another account but want to maximize the interest earned.They usually credit the bonus interest into my account around the 10th every month,btohqsg
clear your points before cancelling the altitude card. 1 year later   then reapply for new signup gifts,btohqsg
Login to to your account using ocbc web to find out. Example can be found on ocbc 360 website.,btohqsg
Between these two  will be hsbc revo,btohqsg
Depend if u want to save on fcy fee or u can get 4mpd on uob visa signature for foreign currency spend when u spend at least 1k and cap at 2k spending,btohqsg

Idunno...its public housing... Gotta live by govt rules... Otherwise it's condo,btohqsg
its like the whole system is assuming a lot of things to go smoothly for a young couple‚Ä¶i.e. graduate at 22/24  after 5 years salary max out at 14k for the couple  just nice 27/29 can still have baby and thus a house is ready for u,btohqsg
Of coz mah  birth rate dropping so crazily  how can we incentivize singles,btohqsg
Looks like more than $14K income for resale can buy Standard and maybe Plus  no Prime.,btohqsg
Govt wants to be incentivising people to have kids  not singles who yolo,btohqsg
They are only limiting to those Prime HDB.. normal HDB no income ceiling restriction for resale,btohqsg
Previously singles are only limited to non-matured estate.. now no restrictions,btohqsg
Also hard to get those better location. Just bring hope only.,btohqsg
Guess they knew the single going to vote opposition party. Faster do it before 2025. üòÇ,btohqsg
At least they are building singles' flat there  last time only at ulu locations.. ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Now 30plus I guess about 40% is single. I think they knew it is serious losing vote.üòÇ,btohqsg
40%?!?!? Where got so much? Most people should be married by that age,btohqsg
We need to set up arranged marriages like in India  seems to work out for them  even though that is personal rather than govt sanctioned,btohqsg
Drastically Declining birth rate can mean the end of singapore,btohqsg
End of the world actually. universe 25 experiment,btohqsg
Eh for EGA Bonus interest do they pay it out in one shot?,btohqsg
So will reflect as multiple bonus interest? Okay then shall wait longer. They have till 31 Aug I guess...,btohqsg
