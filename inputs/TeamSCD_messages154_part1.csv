Hi what time do u want?,btohqsg
Hi guys. Anyone with a Mazda 3 3rd gen experienced doing tuning before? I need some advice,btohqsg
What do you all think about plug and play types like gan ga+,btohqsg
from reviews... you can consider hex performance,btohqsg
I'd say dont waste time tuning because it's NA,btohqsg
The amount of money spent wont get much in return,btohqsg
I was attracted to the 15% fuel economy. Lol,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s was what the ad on the gan ga+ said. Very optimistic,btohqsg
downside rims  change tyres width to 185,btohqsg
but dun show us the car,btohqsg
But with fuel economy  you will loose power,btohqsg
+ doing this u will feel more power,btohqsg
But thinner then width looks so easy to bully,btohqsg
ya cannot have best of both worlds,btohqsg
Drive slowly. Look sporty can alr,btohqsg
hex performance tuner's name similar to yours.. Ronny. u ask similar name gt discount bo ahahaha,btohqsg

Oh ya. Look good first haha,btohqsg

If tune my pick up faster then Iâ€™ll haha,btohqsg
no la cfm coming from hardware de,btohqsg
@Bungalaixyou need to drive up to here... Then have some burgers,btohqsg
Bro just tune ðŸ˜‚ no 15% ask them for refund,btohqsg
If not u can tune ur torque higher,btohqsg
Sorry. Ronnie says price fixed no similar name discount ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Not to show off but tuning won't increase your horsepower but can increase your torque and throttle responses.,btohqsg
As the saying goes  your car head infront of your opponent  you win abit liao. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
