The glass roof for rgs really wow sia... the interior very atas also especially the door closing sound. I wanted to get touran initially... but after my wife see cit.. touran kanna banish liao. Too old according to my wife,btohqsg
Actually Nissan x-trail have glass roof too,btohqsg
I think you more or less sold on xtrail already. Can go down for viewing / test drive,btohqsg
In fact I had viewed & test drive with other dealer.. Jz need more opinion from experience ppl like u all.. As this is my 1st time buy car  scare to make wrong decision,btohqsg
Same la. But if u keen in nissan can ask dealer if ok to send for inspection,btohqsg
Any misc charges like admin fees gst all the nonsense. What bank they offering n whats the rate etc,btohqsg
Must inspect. If not  anything else  you have to bear.,btohqsg
Ya.. Thanks for sharing  had done some research on pre-purchase inspection  think find my own a workshop/STA/vicomto do inspection,btohqsg
Find a workshop that you can trust. I think for first car owners  usually you won’t know where to go to coz you may not have connections.One way is to check with the specific car group on their frequent car workshop or friends recommendations.,btohqsg
If buy car after Oct 1 and vep tag need to collect in jb  can drive to jb without tag to collect it?,btohqsg
Register on-line and they will delivery the RFID tag to you via mail,btohqsg
No need to collect in JB,btohqsg
Don go sta or vicom. Find a good 1. I think someone here recommended AA. They are standalone and shld be able to give a more reliable review. Just don go to them if getting french cars. They r nt good at it,btohqsg
