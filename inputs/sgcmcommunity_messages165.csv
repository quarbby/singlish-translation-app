Wrong group chat lah....here only welcome car porn like this,btohqsg
this plate cost more than the car,btohqsg
What is a good buy to you,btohqsg
Fast charger damages batts over long term,btohqsg
Hdb dweller not convinent to charge currently,btohqsg
No. You don't get free servicing. Which means you cannot spend half a day sitting around drinking free coffee and eating free food in a longue,btohqsg
My friend ask me to go trade in my mini for a tesla,btohqsg
The charger is the biggest issue in my opinion,btohqsg
Many HDBs and condo don't have place to charge,btohqsg
And if have atmost like 1-3,btohqsg
If one block have 400 unit just say only 10% (40 family) have one car  still abit hard to charge when only have 1-3 lot,btohqsg
My neighbour now already complain when people hogging the washing bay  can't imagine if people hog the charger points lol,btohqsg
Have you spoken to EV drivers?,btohqsg
I am sure all of them are complaining about unable to charge,btohqsg
My side got 6 charging points,btohqsg
Nope of course not all of them have this issue  but these are some of the constraint prospective buyers are facing,btohqsg
My friends are always pop over to use the points . Damn funny lor,btohqsg
Like they will look at the place of their home and think where to charge,btohqsg
If it is not feasible they will not consider EV,btohqsg
If you are blessed with multiple place to charge in your place if residency or work then good lor,btohqsg
Interesting. Is this your opinion or those of actual EV drivers?,btohqsg
If not will be like many people who want to buy EV  but unable to do so due to the constraknt,btohqsg
I using petrol car ; friend just ask me to change,btohqsg
I believe I cited my opinion as I mentioned earlier on,btohqsg
My words are not gospel truth lol,btohqsg
I am just like you  one person with his own opinion,btohqsg
My opinion too  don't buy Tesla. They barely have margin  not earning much from cars sold. Which means they can survive with or without your purchase,btohqsg
Should support other dealers who have to charge high margin in order to give free servicing and such  and to keep their employees employed,btohqsg
Tesla batt in ur vezel can sir.?,btohqsg

Changi Airport to Tuas South Boulevard  3am. Full throttle.,btohqsg
Wa BM really want to chop me sia. One wheel bearing $440. Not even in a paid,btohqsg
The service person even told me I can check the price outside first and do myself outside,btohqsg
440 can do all 4 outside still got leftover,btohqsg
Cheapest I see outside is around 250++ but dunno the part come from where. If want OEM quoted around 300++,btohqsg
I just now listen to their agent talk to few people,btohqsg
The warranty like never cover anything,btohqsg
But if you under warrenty   later u go outside do   they say you void warrenty,btohqsg
Sometimes I got this problem also,btohqsg
Mine the agent says cam just change outside cause is typical wear and tear,btohqsg
If like those kind engine gear box issue  they very particular,btohqsg
If people.touch already  they might just void,btohqsg
Better ask them for black and white with their coy chop to cover yourself,btohqsg
Sales man always like to chut badminton 1,btohqsg
"Nvm la  my warranty is ""limited warranty"" cause is their 2nd hand car lol. Sound alike cover alot of thing  but when if you really see like never cover much",btohqsg
When I buy from the person says all got change,btohqsg
Same same . I also sales man,btohqsg
I always say nvm just change   hahaha,btohqsg
When I ask the service centre guy  say they always have this issue when the sales man over promise they can't do anything,btohqsg
Want to hit  target so anything also can .,btohqsg

Just now I see they like keep pushing people to continue sign up for their service package,btohqsg
Out of 5 I see like 3 continue with them,btohqsg
Foc de   better ask them write down . Usually I ask them for break down and write down for me . Later change of sales man . They say they dunnoe .,btohqsg
Same   but u ask them for a detail breakdown and ask them chop with coy chop in agreement . They won’t come and disturb you to sign till you ask them .,btohqsg

Just go find out what your paint code is  either get online or autobacs might have,btohqsg

Look like the guy lose control of the vehicle when over taking and scared of seeing you so keep accelerating,btohqsg
Abit crazy ah  drive estima still want to drive so recklessly. It must be a wild ride for the passengers,btohqsg
There's all sorts of crazies on the road these days,btohqsg
Yeah.. These kind of 'mini bus' car is not meant for this kind of manueve  if keep drive like that one day really lose control of the vehicle,btohqsg
Not my video by the way. I don’t condone what the cam car did,btohqsg
To be fair  while what the estima did was...well...questionable...the cam car also can't stay in his own lane and when he overtook the estima he starting inching back to the left from what I can tell...,btohqsg
Exactly. I believe that was what sparked this entire fiasco,btohqsg
A lot of drivers I noticed on the road also cannot drive on a bend and stay in their own lanes 🫢,btohqsg
The amount of times I nearly get side swiped on Nicoll highway not funny.,btohqsg
And it was not intentional  they just drift mid corner...some just cut it altogether 🙃,btohqsg
The fact that the audi couldn’t catch the estima,btohqsg
According to someone here...it's a grocery getter,btohqsg
My friend Audi look nice  dunno what model. But he told me the wear and tear like need to replace often,btohqsg
He use it to improve his dating game lol  it works quite well,btohqsg
It went brooom.. but never move,btohqsg

Unless his is the older one pre MQB,btohqsg
I also every morning brooom  but that’s because it’s actually my job. So that my boss warehouse is nice and clean.,btohqsg
My boss have bmw but didn’t help his dating game. Only attract attention from boys and car guys 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Wa  is it look old or smth?,btohqsg
Usually if it look modern and new will do the job,btohqsg
My friend dating picture literally have him posing with his car for all the pics,btohqsg
But sometimes will attract the wrong type la,btohqsg
Drivers on our roads here are funny.  You come up behind them on lane 1 / overtaking lane  or if you overtake someone  they take it very personally and get stirred and think you're trying to race them.,btohqsg
This kind of pics should attract the correct intended types leh,btohqsg
I think maybe boss car old junk. COE car lah what to do.,btohqsg
This Audi I know  you blink once and he is gone.,btohqsg
He still in the tiktok leh,btohqsg

I heard that Toyota hybrid all very similar one  their latest hybrid engine is almost the same with different tweaks,btohqsg
Haha yeah ok la I mean it's an engineering thing,btohqsg
Once a design is proven and effective  basically it's just improvements on it for later models,btohqsg
The initial part where the R&D is involved is expensive and takes a while to do  and most companies/people are not willing to spend time  money and effort one lol,btohqsg
Yeah  if I am not wrong by 2040 is it all ICE car will get phrase out? At that point will be forced to either get hybrid or electric car already,btohqsg
For commuting purposes yes. For industrial work I doubt it la,btohqsg
I don't think cement trucks will go hybrid that fast lol,btohqsg
Oh ya never think of this lol,btohqsg
I remember I was still in primary school back then 😂,btohqsg
Too long never take taxi already  now days all through the app,btohqsg
The only memory I have of flagging down is in primary school,btohqsg
I mean once the base is established  at tat point its just improvements,btohqsg
Same for phones n stuff. Washing machines..,btohqsg

Wanna ask about engine oil ah,btohqsg
What’s the “grade” of engine oil y’all having?5W -30 or 5W -40?,btohqsg
5W is the viscosity at low temp  40 is the viscosity at running temp,btohqsg
Newer cars tend to have lower viscosities since the engine parts tolerances are smaller  so need thinner oil to get in between the gaps to lubricate the engine,btohqsg
"Singapore weather usually 30 +-  so engine oil near this temp usually flows best  like x said also  new cars usually lower so that the oil can ""run"" to protect your engine the moment you start car",btohqsg
Y’all got like “this time 30  next time 40”? That sort of arrangement?,btohqsg
But older car engines e.g. 10yrs or more liao dun use too low e.g. 0w16 cos engine oil would tend to seep through  one ws boss told me. So a 2014 altis not advisable to use 0w16,btohqsg
My ws guy said sometimes 40 and then 30,btohqsg
Lol no ba  no harm mixing but stick to 0w30 or 20 not too low,btohqsg
Those 0w40 and up tend to for heavy vehicles,btohqsg
Cos his junior already topped in with 40,btohqsg
Hah if you make noise  they'll be in trouble ma  so he tell you OK one lo,btohqsg
6mths later change and remember to stick to 30,btohqsg
I use 0w16 cos hybrid engine,btohqsg
Ya…when I see how he talked to his junior  I know already,btohqsg
So he came up something like sometimes this  sometimes that,btohqsg
Once ok la our engines not tofu 😂,btohqsg
No point playing around with it… unless there is something you’re after.,btohqsg
Dig out the hyundai avante manual to read 🤭☺️🤭,btohqsg
Will u buy workshop or own engine oil?,btohqsg
Ic..your workshop engine oil change how much?,btohqsg
Not sure market now long time never drive,btohqsg
Sedan or hatchback. Need Cheap  low fc  reliable,btohqsg
Erm…I took a package and costs 200 odd,btohqsg
Wah what eo they use? Cos outside even with amsoil is about 150 to 180 but only 3.5ltr used,btohqsg
That's how they make money lol,btohqsg
Get it? Fits good? Cause it fits your criteria,btohqsg
They just dk how to appreciate it,btohqsg
Mazda 3 I believe they are one of the cheapest among the Nippon cars. Got mitsubishi attrage la  but I personally think is too small,btohqsg
I see FB put their new Demo unit price at 143 888,btohqsg
Mazda 3 is ok. No frills. Can go for it.,btohqsg
no frills but the interior feels premium compared to the other cars in the same category,btohqsg
Yup. Too bad. The Mazda 3 is associated w PHV,btohqsg
The new M Hybrid feels very premium,btohqsg
Lexus gg to be ur new premium taxi,btohqsg
Alot of the entry level sedan now people think PHV haha. Corolla  Elantra  Mazda 3 all PHV favourite. For crossover SUV the king is vezel then occasionally will see nissan qashqai,btohqsg
But got good think also la  for all those PHV favourite models  the parts are quite common and almost all workshop can repair if have any issue,btohqsg
Oh ya  Prius and chr also.,btohqsg
Cos its easy to get parts frm stockist,btohqsg
Basically as long as jap or kor cars  the parts r easy,btohqsg
Hyundai n Kia share same parts,btohqsg
Actually Korean car not bad also  but resale value is lower than Japanese car. Especially if compared to Toyota or honda. Sometimes even lower than Mazda cause dealer always say they very hard sell 2nd hand Korean car,btohqsg
My friend COE car for his Hyundai Elantra kena chop alot when he sell away.,btohqsg
If you don't care about others perception then it doesn't matter,btohqsg
But unfortunately it's all about face when buying car sets you back 100k before you even buy the car,btohqsg
Now K cars more lux thn J cars,btohqsg
K cars dare to slap luxury all over,btohqsg
J cars still plastic unless its camry n abv,btohqsg

How to report a unprofessional car salesman?,btohqsg
Becareful of this car company precision motorworks,btohqsg
I offered a few hundreds off his car asking price.,btohqsg
I think he angry or what don’t want sell me n say ppl viewing in 1 hour,btohqsg
I said I’m willing to pay full price now n can view earlier than his customer or I can even paynow now without viewing,btohqsg
He rejected. I think he wants to get even with me for offering a few hundreds off his asking price,btohqsg
After he sell the car  he says I’m low baller,btohqsg
Hate the game not the player,btohqsg
u got the SGCM ad on the car?,btohqsg
Paste here  we can still see the ad even if sold,btohqsg
He said the car body value is 6000,btohqsg
Why u want to buy left 8 months only,btohqsg
I calculated the depre is abt $20+ a day,btohqsg
$18k depre how to be $20,btohqsg
Few hundred won't call you low ball  if you straight away ask him down by 10k+ then they might be upset 😂,btohqsg
I cut his price by few hundreds then eventually relent n match his asking price. He still say I lowball,btohqsg
I think he’s trying to get back at me for cutting his price,btohqsg
I’m sure nothing personal lah. Why would he be enemy with his own commission. Times are hard leh,btohqsg
I don’t know. I alr matched his asking price he still don’t want to sell me. I offered to pay deposit immediately b4 his customer view the car but to no avail. Anyway just take note of this precision motorworks,btohqsg
Your maths a bit weak eh I think,btohqsg
The 20 a day math is not mathing,btohqsg
Best case scenario you get 6k also will end up at 30 a day,btohqsg
Sorry my maths fail how to count ah? I see the price is 39 980 for 8 month 19 days left (259 days?)So if we take away the body of 6k still need pay 33 980. Then if divide by 259 is still $131.19 per day?,btohqsg
Or is it I don't understand how it work haha,btohqsg
u did not include parf rebate when scrap,btohqsg
Athey’re quite the clique  so if you don’t know them  it’s not uncommon to feel that way. So…either he sells it to you or not but either way  just move on.You report also nothings going to happen to him,btohqsg
Bro gotta search up calculator when he has a calculator app,btohqsg
He want to show you chim math,btohqsg
I dumb. I just see bank account got money or not 😂,btohqsg
Sometimes reopen again thinking got money magically go in,btohqsg
🥹 I thought I was alone,btohqsg
Not a great car to drive yourself..,btohqsg
I see the depre less than 10k if nego,btohqsg
what does quite the clique mean?,btohqsg
Great car to be driven in,btohqsg
Eh what you know about lux car,btohqsg
Precision is nicer to you if you’re friends with them..? At least that’s how I feel lah,btohqsg
I always hear@anwo252talk whenever I take his rickshaw to work,btohqsg
But the road tax  high mileage n maintenance is very worrying,btohqsg
You think you buying A class ah 😅,btohqsg
Very worth! Free slammed look when the suspension fails (seems to be on its way out already),btohqsg
You're buying an s class? That comes as a part of s class ownership?,btohqsg
Then put AMG badge on sides,btohqsg
I think I will skip. But the depre is too enticing. Sometimes I will think abt it again,btohqsg
Car ownership is not just about depreciation,btohqsg
You must remember you will get barely nothing for this car when you do sell it  too used and not in the best shape for great body value,btohqsg
Add on your insurance and running costs,btohqsg
Not sure if you want to tahan those or not,btohqsg
Better get something that doesn't burden you,btohqsg
Like the heavy body on those bags,btohqsg
He’s willing to decrease another few k,btohqsg
But I more prone to skip although it’s v cheap,btohqsg
Aiya just buy don't think! You very rich sir,btohqsg
But car in sg very ex. Don’t buy better,btohqsg
Have u seen the ads link?,btohqsg
No one will want to take full cash. Be it AD or PI,btohqsg

Coz I like to talk about fwd Lux cars,btohqsg
Then I talk about it for what huh,btohqsg
Hello Bros  thinking to do a car wrap for peugeot 5008. How much will it roughly cost? Is it worth it?,btohqsg
Imagine the joy you get looking at it everyday.,btohqsg
Mercedes to roll out new global marketing campaignThe new campaign takes a new look at the brand's use of the term 'class'  and looks to bridge the gap between the firm's historic and future models.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
I have personally done wraps and spray on my cars before.A good wrap nowadays will cost about 2k and good spray upwards of 3k to 5kBoth wraps and spray provide a wide array of colors but for gloss wraps  they do not shine as brightly as a spray job. A matte wrap I think is cheaper than a matte spray.Wraps usually don’t cover the door sills  additional fees involved. So if u pick a color that is vastly different than your stock paint color. The door sills and may look out of place e.g. u have a blue car and want to wrap it red. A spray job will normally include the door sills.Wraps do offer some form of protection on your original paintwork against stone chips and stains etc etc. where as spray is just as it is. However when the wrap is damaged  I can’t just apply putty and do a small spray to cover it  u need to rewrap the entire panel. Depending on the severity of the damage  wrap can cost more than the spray or vice versa. But note that if u spray a non factory color  when u respray a panel  u might not be able to achieve the same shade.Wraps may cause discoloration to your factory paint if constantly under sun  and kept on for 4-5 yrs. especially if stock paint is of poorer quality and usually happens to white. May also cause paint peel off if not removed carefully. Wrap shops do charge extra for removal.Overall it boils down to personal choice and driving habits/routes. If u go nshw often  or off-road  the spray job will probably end up with many stone chips and if u spray red over blue  u might see blue spots underneath. A matte wrap can go weeks without wash and still look relatively ok.If mostly in sg  and under shelter  a spray may serve u better  unless touch wood  damages. But more maintenance if u want to keep it pristine.My 20 cents,btohqsg
Wrap using good 3M material can go upwards of 3k+ also. Using good material can mean longer durability and better finish,btohqsg
Ppf is about 3 times the price of wrap... and is for paint protection... but now got atas ppf with special effects,btohqsg
Wrap will have issue if always park outdoor? Hearsay the wrap might shrink due to frequent exposure from the sun,btohqsg
