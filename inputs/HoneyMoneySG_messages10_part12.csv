then withdraw to bank acc viacrypto.com?🙃,btohqsg
He is talking about the credit card. You are smart  but the system seems smarter I guess. There is no loop hole as far as I see.You have to understand the difference between credit and debit.,btohqsg
Used to be able to:AMEX UOB> GPMC > Buy USDC (CDC App had cc fee waiver) > Convert to XSGD > Send to bank accountYou would gain 1.7% (AMEX UOB) + 1.2%~2% (GPMC) cashbackBut now cc fee waiver doesn't apply to stablecoin purchases so.. 🤷,btohqsg
Has one gotten the revolut cashback on public transport by topping up $300 via GPMC? Previously we only can get the cash back when we top up via bank transfer. TIA!!!,btohqsg
used to be able to just AMEX-> GPMC -> BANK... earn 1.5% for nothing,btohqsg
Buy and sell USDC will lose money,btohqsg
Thats where the cashback come in,btohqsg
now no more already right 😅,btohqsg
I can’t seem to top up another grabpay mc using the same Amex tcb. Is it because I’ve max the daily/monthly limit on my another GP mc?,btohqsg

Such an online spend best to use citi smrt card?,btohqsg
Anyway I know the recommended card to tag to amaze for oversea spending is Citi rewards card. I saw that there is a cap of 1k for the 4 mpd per month. After that it is 0.4 mpd ? Considering if I am expected to spend between 10-20k oversea. Wouldn't that be alot of loss miles in my case,btohqsg
Did paid using grab pay before at hospital no points earns best use your credits cards,btohqsg
If you're not in a rush  can wait a couple more weeks - price of the 13 will drop soon since 14 is coming,btohqsg
does the price rly drop? I rmb last year when 13 came out  the price of 12 still same. they even stopped selling 12,btohqsg
Usually previous model willl drop but stock will be limited from Beng shop eventually no more sells unless u go authorize shop like challenger or apple,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check with you all for the GrabPay card accelerator..If let’s say I link grab to FavePay and pay for dining  does it consider?*Or instead link  I key the GPMC and add as CC?If let’s say I link grab to ShopBack and pay for dining  does it consider?*Or instead link  I key the GPMC and add as CC?Does the accelerator 0.8% on selected catalogues means you only can use GPMC and not GrabPay Wallet/Later?Anyone know?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check  if I first time apply American express true cashback card  do you all recommend me to apply this card or apply other American express with better sign-up deal first then apply true cashback card  since true cashback card sign up bonus is not as attractive as other card. Thank you.,btohqsg
Always get the better deals first like:AMEX Krisflyer Ascendhttps://hmsg.link/kfascendAMEX Krisflyer Bluehttps://hmsg.link/kfblueThen get True Cashback later,btohqsg
Will my revolut get frozen if amex>grab>revolut>oversea atm? Need some cash when traveling,btohqsg
I will be better off doing the conversion in revolut during weekday first if i need to widthdraw on weekend oversea  right?,btohqsg
Revolut can even do limit order  stop loss order  or market order for currency exchange,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply Chris. if I am not a heavy spender also just apply one of the two cards first then only apply true cashback card?,btohqsg
wow thanks bro. Buying the new iPhone 14 next month?,btohqsg
How long do I need to keep the krisflyer and when will u suggest i can apply the true cashback card then? Thank you.,btohqsg
They got Chris honey money promo code for iPhone? 😅,btohqsg
Yes if you like Miles. Otherwise  wait and see if 1 Sep will have better offers. Usually refresh monthly,btohqsg
Once you get the first AMEX card and spend it  can apply for the next already,btohqsg
Not for now  iPhone also not for my usage,btohqsg
Don't have  I think their margin very thin already,btohqsg
Ok I go support them next month,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I just saw your grabpay video. Care to explain how does the 1.2% cash back works?,btohqsg
1.2% is from Grab Platinium range rewards system. When I spent enough to reach this tier  ur spending will receive 1.2% worth of points.These points can offset for next purchases or change for things within the grab app vendors,btohqsg
You mean 1:6 points that one?,btohqsg
Yes.6 points earned per S$1500 pts = S$1 redemption6/500 = 1.2% Rewards,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG. If I am expected to spend 10-20k oversea shopping. What would be the best option bcos Citi rewards applicable to first 1k.OCBC titanium or UOB Privi ?,btohqsg
