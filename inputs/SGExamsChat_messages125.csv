Wat matters is how u defined success and satisfaction,btohqsg
Success can be as simple as I got a job I have most passion in. Satisfaction is the job that gives me not only sufficient earnings but flexibility in time.,btohqsg
Not always success is defined in terms of money and power only. But as people around we should encourage healthy definitions of success,btohqsg
Or success can be defined as I learnt a new skill and applying it in a job or initiative.,btohqsg
Yes. Or simply that me and my family are all healthy and get to eat together every day.,btohqsg

bubble tea has more sugar than coke,btohqsg
Im scared of u too daddy,btohqsg
i havent touched bubble tea for idk how long alr,btohqsg
Thts a major healtg issue in sg,btohqsg
And they alrdy ban high sugary drinks,btohqsg
Lets just leave it like that,btohqsg
Liho is too expensive for me. Like the cost you can buy a meal at mcd,btohqsg

Is it advisable to take BMAT when in IB Y5 cuz as far as I heard from my senior Y6 barely have time to prepare for BMAT.,btohqsg
And is the diagnostic BMAT a good guage where you stand?,btohqsg
What is the difference for UCAT and BMAT ?,btohqsg
U mean past papers? If so  yes,btohqsg
BMAT is basically o lvl physics chem  bio and math,btohqsg
But what if I don't have ns,btohqsg
Then advice is take it during the graduating year  y6,btohqsg
Cos bmat results are only valid for a year,btohqsg
So taking in y5 wont help  because ur results will be invalid during the year u apply for uni,btohqsg
Ironically i didnt do o lvl physics  but yet i got almost all the physics qns correct  compared to chem and bio,btohqsg
U just need to know all the formulas well  and apply,btohqsg
Same  i didnt touch since sec 2,btohqsg
I didn't even touch in sec 1,btohqsg
Na only got like bio n chem,btohqsg
Didn’t they let u take bio in sec 1 physics in sec 2,btohqsg
That's why I'm slowly falling behind,btohqsg
Well  fun fact is IB is easier than A levelsHaters can hate on it though.,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that I can get hold of the papers?,btohqsg
Cuz the project has high weightage,btohqsg
If u are aiming for local med sch  shldnt be that tough ba,btohqsg
Overseas wise u need to score quite well,btohqsg
But nevertheless my essay fked me so oh well,btohqsg
I tried 2019 paper n I did bad,btohqsg
Honestly I don't really see a difference in IB n a level,btohqsg
Other than IB having loads of project,btohqsg
The content is less in depth,btohqsg
U can compare between HL Chem and H2 Chem,btohqsg
I would say the difference is quite apparent,btohqsg
Any advice when taking the BMAT?,btohqsg
Dont be like me LOL  go in yolo and waste money,btohqsg
I low-key think that my parents applied for me this year,btohqsg
Ur results wont be valid  so u are wasting money,btohqsg
Rn all I know is the slots all full and they managed to squeeze me in,btohqsg
And I feel like attempting it HAHA,btohqsg
