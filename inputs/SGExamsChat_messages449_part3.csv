Those in jc/mi  can maybe advise me how to diy headstart econs + gps?,btohqsg
the only way to do well is to do alot of tys. Just do alot of it and learn the qn patterns and phrasing. in exam  u wont have time to think. u have to be on autopilot mode,btohqsg

Yes  but itâ€™s not what the education system rewards. Even in uni u donâ€™t get the time to do that  and u donâ€™t have a tys either,btohqsg
i disagree that uni doesnâ€™t let you do that,btohqsg
that ones very subjective to the prof and how they structure their course/exams,btohqsg
Ah yes. Agreed. Agreed. Unfortunately those are rare and few between,btohqsg
in a sense some uni courses was easier to just practice instead of understand and still score,btohqsg
but maybe iâ€™m lucky enough to feel i had the time to actually understand all of them,btohqsg
nah they just on the grindset,btohqsg
i donâ€™t practice even in uni,btohqsg
i went in with understanding and kinda did that. practice wouldâ€™ve helped but eh,btohqsg
ok i take it back. itâ€™s not that i had time. i just chose to use the limited time to understand over practice,btohqsg
It â€˜s somewhat true tho. A lot of ppl been doing home reno with a multitude of stuffs from Taobao tgt with some themes of their choice,btohqsg
Cuz u buy all ur stuff from Taobao?,btohqsg

I seen a lot of YT home reno vloggers does that for their BTO/resale,btohqsg
