"sometimes as much as it sounds invalidating or dismissive you gotta learn to ignore what that teacher said to you. i have had teachers telling me im not good enough in any aspect and that definitely affected me especially because my fam used to say the same thing. not sure if youre taking o lvls now or alr finished o lvls but your prelims does not determine your actual final grades  if you know you put in the effort  you definitely will improvein terms of mental health i can understand the struggles  i completely ignored my mental health in sec sch because i had to numb it just to get thru school because it was a daily basis  there isnt even time to relax. same with jc  i can understand that its frustrating because i wish that i took care of my mental state so i wouldnt still be depressed or have anxiety through these past 8 years  im in uni now with only 3 days of sch so i have the time to choose when to take a breakyour feelings are valid and if this helps  this is what one of my friend told me""its not about trying to get rid of your mental health problems  its about learning to live in harmony with it""jiayou  u can do it",btohqsg

i did ignore his words at the start of sec 1. my maths teacher has taught me frm the beginning of sec sch and sometimes he might be too insensitive w his words and have short tempered too. even if i make the slightest mistake in class / didnâ€™t fllw his method of doing the equation   he wld tore my ws / slam the table / broke my calculator / detect my marks during mock tests. it got so bad that it always gives me panic attack during his lessons so my mum eventually feedback to the year head and he did listen for a while. sec 1-2  i was doing well in my studies but in sec 3  due to demand in studies and emphasis on my health  he told me that i shld pay more attention to my studies than my health. i hv to do weekly medical appointments aft schâ€¦ thereâ€™s curriculum time even aft sch hours so i explain to him abt my situation and he said that it was all excuses and excuses. he also said that he managed to achieve 90% distinction in his previous sec 4 class so he def expect 100% distinction on us too. and yes he was also keaneâ€™s amaths teacher,btohqsg

itâ€™s like sometimes i feel worthless when all my other peers in class is achieving high  distinction,btohqsg
