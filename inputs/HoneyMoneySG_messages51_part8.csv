For those who uses UOB Evol card  can anyone share with me some examples of what qualifies as an online spend  I assume places like Shopee  Grab  Lazada etc does not qualify as online spend because I assume its payment of funds to payment service providers? Does only pure transactions made through a website online constitutes in the Online spend category?,btohqsg
shopee  grab and lazada are online. Payment via app/website/scan QR are usually online with some exceptions e.g. transactions via royal caribbean website are processed offline,btohqsg
Hi  does this mean if I only put $100 and already received the $20 ($2 cash coupon x 10 days)  i can already withdraw my money? Thanks a lot ☺️,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that mentions this? Their T&C not really helpful in explaining what constitutes as online spend.,btohqsg
this is practical explanation of the official definition in the TnC,btohqsg
(k) any top-ups or payment of funds to payment service providers or prepaid accountsHmm  this part of the T&C kinda confused me on this part. That's why. Have you used it before and it does qualify?,btohqsg
everything under clause 20 are excluded  even if they are online,btohqsg
Sorry gurus  how do i check when is my HSBC EGA promotion ending? I opened my account around end april 23,btohqsg
when u sent the sms to register for bonus interest?,btohqsg
then your bonus interest period is till 31 Jul,btohqsg
So... In August need to resms? Or...(Just double checking what's often the things to do),btohqsg
if there is substantial balance in Jul  then need to reset balance in Aug (withdraw everything except $2k on 1Aug)  then register in Sep,btohqsg
But if withdraw everything then leave $2k on 1 Aug  then in September they will take reference of $2k from Aug instead of $0 right?,btohqsg
May incur $5 fall under fee for ega personal account if did not keep $2k average daily balance. No need leave $2k if yours is ega premier account.,btohqsg
Does using Krispay to buy fairprice voucher qualify for ×4 points instarem promotion?,btohqsg
I don’t think they allow you to use Kris pay to buy anything in fairprice. Only for voucher redemption.,btohqsg
If u meant Amaze wallet instead of Krispay  then yes,btohqsg
I think he plans to use Amaze card link to ApplyPay/GPay. Then use Krispay+Amaze(ApplePay/Gpay) to pay at FairPrice.,btohqsg
Good day  does Uob one qualifies fast SAL transfer as salary credit for the higher interest? TIA,btohqsg
yea I think so but that will not be possible,btohqsg
hmm. KRIS+ with HSBC REVO = got 10 X? i know this question asked before.. 😂Just now i called hsbc  they say valid,btohqsg
Hi Dont know where to find this information but for credit card exclusions  is it those kinds of spending has no rewards at all  or just no additional rewards.,btohqsg
You can use the keyword “Kris HSBC 10x” to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Okay. I will do it thanks,btohqsg
I saw the TnC. Saw the exclusion list. Not sure the exclusion means totally no miles at all or just no bonus miles,btohqsg
Qualified transactions:Exclusion -> zero pointWhitelist -> 10 pointsnot in whitelist and not in exclusion list -> 1 point.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if grabmastercard is nerfed on Fairprice @ Kopitiam? I can pay using Fairprice app at ntuc using grabcard but it seems like it doesn’t allow transactions at the Kopitiam branded food courts that use the Fairprice app to pay.,btohqsg
generally can get extra miles if merchant allow payment via Krispay and get 4mpd if MCC is on whitelist for 10x points on HSBC Revo,btohqsg
I usually use another CC via Apple Pay to pay using fairprice app at kopitiam. Not sure about using grabpay MasterCard. If you manually key in the card details  does it allow you to do so?I know can’t add grab card to Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Have always been using it no issue. Only today I tried and it doesn’t work anymore. but I haven’t eaten out in a month.They also scrubbed grabpay option off the sgQR,btohqsg
KrisPay doesn't allow usage of cards for purchases at Fairpricr finest (only miles accepted),btohqsg
Thanks.. that what HSBC told me.. but i saw some earlier comments that Kris & HSBC dun get the 10X which is 4miles...i go read again later,btohqsg
if the post u reading is using Kris+ to pay cdg   think it is bugged  processed offline,btohqsg
Only allow to use Kris+ miles for FairPrice voucher redemption at customer service counter.,btohqsg
no promo now right?i have tens of Krispay miles stuck in account,btohqsg
May I check with you miles experts out there. If my wife and I each get a miles CC. Can we both transfer to one krisflyer account for the miles? Say maybe to just mine?,btohqsg
no u cannot.miles can only be moved into the same name frequent flyer accountbut you can appoint nominees in the frequent flyer account like Krisflyer and add your husband/wife and children (max 5 nominees) which will allow the main account holder to redeem tickets for the nominees using main account holder miles.,btohqsg
alternatively.. one person apply the miles card and give supp card to the second person.,btohqsg
Ah ok makes sense. Thanks a lot! So its actually better for me to do all the miles and maybe my wife something else.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  if want to redeem flight ticket for family members we need to add in the details in krisflyer account in advance right ?,btohqsg
yes got some cooldown period rule.. best to add at least one week in advance.,btohqsg
Ohh nice. Thanks  didn't know too,btohqsg
and cannot REMOVE nominees without a fee... so add nominees carefully,btohqsg
What’s the best credit card to attach to google pay ?,btohqsg
