üöÄPika World Update- Oct 28 2021üöÄüöñGeneral Motors: Poor Guidance ArrivedüõªShares of the company wobbled as the full-year outlook appeared conservative. Earnings per share were strong and stood at $1.52 compared to estimates of $0.98. Sales were weak  but it is not a surprise given a global semiconductor shortage affecting car production. The low inventories are also pushing car prices and improving profitability.Although the company had increased its full-year per share guidance  it is still smaller than the current quarter beat  affecting the stock's sentiments. The company used to be one of Pika World's favourites  but we have since pared off all positions. Nonetheless  the prospect of the company's future under the new CEO is on track to enable the company to rise out of its legacy tag.üí¥Here comes the Tax story Againüí∞Democrats in the Senate are now proposing a minimum 15% corporate income tax rate as they continue to hunt for new revenues to fund President Biden's social spending bill  including those plans to combat climate change.To fully implement the different bills will cost a hefty $2 trillion over the decade. The 15% tax rate is still much lower than the envisaged 25%. A complication arises as some party members have differing views since Democrats need nearly all members to be tightly aligned.Pika World continues to monitor the bill's passage as we expect an impact on the inflation rate and economic growth projection with the successful approval of the spending bills.üñ•AMD: Pika World's FavouriteüíªThe company had reported a good set of results  and shares had risen sharply in 2021 as they continue to capture market shares from Intel. In addition  the company saw strength in the premium PC market  which is a bright spot for AMD.Guidance was also healthy. The company is expecting up to $4.4 billion $4.6 billion in revenue  which is still above the consensus level of $4.24 billion. A more vital sign is its projection that it expects a healthy expansion in all of its business segments.Pika World has a position in AMD as we believe the stock price is rewarded by the firm revenue growth in server units and other high growth areas. As a result  we maintain a positive outlook on the company.‚öíPolitical tension continues to Brewüî≠One of China Telecom units is denied of its operation in the US on national security grounds. Political risk in a business environment is still operating in the background as the Federal Communications Commission (FC) is still eyeing the potential threats posed by the Chinese government.While Auntie Yellen and the Chinese Vice Premier had talked for the second time in four months  Pika World believes the ongoing hostile action between both countries will still be in investors' minds.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive The GDP data  which we expect a slower growth rate of 2.7% compared to 6.7% in the prior period.Initial Jobless Claims will also be released concurrently  and we expect the same level at 290K from the previous period.ECB Press Conference will also begin at 8.30pm.Pika World will be looking at the labour market and regional economies in Europe for clues of buoyancy in the market.It is Oct 28  Thursday  at 7.15 am in Singapore and 7.15 pm in New York. The earnings season appears strong  and we hope all Pika World's friends a splendid finish for Oct 2021.,btohqsg
ISOteam ($0.136/$0.137)- Above is weekly chart and there have been some volume built up quietly on this one.- Looks to be breaking out of downtrend line.Looking back  they invested $5mil into Sunseap - Solar renewal energy group back in 2017.(Note:- No idea how much their stake have been diluted along the way as fund raising definitely took place since then- Earlier this year  Sunseap reported that they are trying to push for an IPO to raise as much as $600 mil + by the end of 2021.If this IPO materialise  I do believe their $5m investment will likely quadruple based on the size of the amount raised.The recent play up could be due to Sunseap getting closer to the IPO since we are already at Q4 2021.Fingers crossed and good luck holders üí™üèºDYODD.Sources:1)https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/renewable-energy-firm-sunseap-weighing-ipo-sources2)http://isoteam.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20170502_192728_5WF_FNGS851VYTPGM2B8.2.pdf,btohqsg

how ah japfa yg tomolo ?,btohqsg
Asiatic ($0.008/$0.009)- MACD looking good- fresh new trend- counter have based out at $0.006-$0.007 (without much liquidity here)- with this ongoing upwards momentum  $0.008 should be pretty safe since Neo Garden boss became SSH start of 2021 at $0.008 too. (Owning more than 12%)Today CSC woke up and cleared a few levels. Seems like we are in a construction recovery play led by Tritech.Earlier I added $0.008 too.Good luck. DYODD at all times as market can change and we must always react in accordance.,btohqsg
Big Boss Neo Kah Kiat of Neo Garden also bought in $0.008 earlier this year in Jan 2021.For me  buying at $0.008 which is his same price level is relatively very safe as I don‚Äôt believe he is buying into this counter for the sake of buying. He should have some plans. Hopefully.Looking forward to more game on the micro pennies sector too.üôèüèª,btohqsg

So still earn ... not cut lose,btohqsg
Just read deeper and Asiatic is not just in the construction (fire protection industry).They are also in the energy business and with the recent focus by government in this segment  it does make this one a good candidate for some play.Furthermore with new SSH Neo Kah Kiat buying in at $0.008 earlier this year (194 mil shares which is equivalent to 12.46%).$0.008 is actually a strong psychological support considering this is a fresh uptrend.Can expect more game from this one.Hopefully some news catalyst to come too  with regards to the energy business would be most welcomed!DYODD and good luck to tomorrow market,btohqsg

"‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update- Oct 29 2021‚úàÔ∏èüöôFord: Truly an UnderdogüõªIn our daily update on 10 September  we have painted a bring spot for Ford. The company had delivered a robust quarter eating with beats in profit projection. Moreover  the raising of full-year profit guidance brings a smile to the investors.A piece of more delightful news is the return of quarterly dividends. Earnings per share rocket 51 cents compared to an estimate of 27 cents. The CEO also conveyed the successful company navigation in chip shortages and Covid-19 woes. There is the expectation for production to recover strongly as more parts become available. The idea is to replenish stocks in the dealer inventory.Nonetheless  the shift towards paying out dividends evokes confidence and strongly signals the enormous improving business sentiments and the ability to fund investment in its EV plan.Pika World maintains a positive outlook on the stock consistent with our prior feature of the company prospect.üì±Apple: Supply Issues Woes‚è≥The much-anticipated earnings result is here. Unfortunately  the company earnings result fell short of expectation as the CEO Tim Cook signals a more pronounced problem in supply constraints. However  earnings per share were in line with expectation  and revenue was lighter at $83.3.6 billion compared to estimates of $84.85 billion.The bright spot lies in services revenue which rose 25.6% compared to a year ago despite a less rosy revenue from iPhone. Since the onset of the pandemic  Apple has not provided earnings guidance. The company is still expecting a robust December quarter that is likely to hit a record.It is perhaps the first quarter Apple had missed estimates since April 2016  but Pika World remains hopeful that the company will register a firmer outlook ahead once supply constraints fade.üíéLucid: A Rare Gem being PolishedüíéDelivery is set to start on 30 October  and this provides good sentiments for the shares. It is expected to deliver around 520 vehicles. The price tag is a wow as the Air ""Dream Edition"" costs a whopping $170 000 for its base model.Lucid has shown remarkable progress in the execution of plans  and Pika World maintains optimism about the company's outlook.ü©∫Teladoc: A stock that Pains UsüíäThe company is Pika World's favourite. While it forms a tiny fraction of our portfolio  we believe its performance has been underappreciated. Third-quarter saw a net loss of $84.3 million which is smaller than expected.For the past three earnings reports  the stock had always fallen after the announcement of results. Paid membership had risen by 2% on a yearly growth rate which is consistent with estimates. In addition  the total visits hit 3.9 million  which smashed the target of 3.5 million.Pika World continues to monitor the company's progress as we are hopeful that its services will continue to be in demand even in a post-pandemic world.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive Personal Spending data  which we expect moderation to 0.5% from 0.8% in the prior period.It is Oct 29  Friday  at 7.02 am in Singapore and 7.02 pm in New York. It is the last trading of the month  and we hope all friends of Pika World a Moonatic day.",btohqsg
Yup üëç hope Asiatic is ready. They went from 10/11 to 6/7 where it based out with no liquidity and now back to 8The liquidity in this counter mainly is above $0.008 especially since Mr Neo came in as SSH this year at $0.008If BBs really want play this  they must push to above $0.009/$0.010   then more market participation comes,btohqsg
Since we are at the month‚Äôs end today  zoomed into Asiatics monthly chart.Analysis1) Big spike in volume in Jan 2021 which was when Neo Garden boss came in as SSH at $0.008. In that period  price went up to $0.0112) After the spike up in Jan21  the counter have some what went to limbo and bottomed out at $0.006/$0.007 where it was supported by the green uptrend Line still.3) Recently  counter started coming alive too and today being month end  I don‚Äôt see how it will close $0.007 at all. I believe today will be the 1st time where monthly will close above this year downtrend line.I would say $0.008 should be good to collect in case some flushing comes along to Shake off weak hands at here before their upcoming test of the resistance at $0.010.4) Recently seems to be gaining traction with QT moving and maintaining at $0.006/$0.007 and CSC moving up 3 pips too yesterday before closing at $0.013DYODD and OTOT. Market can turn and we have to react always,btohqsg
