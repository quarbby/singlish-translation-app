update: i'm out but is it normal for an agent to question my reason to resign,btohqsg
oo i see! i actually don't know how to mine rn bc i just told them my reasonbut they asked me to continue until end of contract,btohqsg
One possibility is the agent might have the fear of being penalized or getting the commission cut or void when someone doesn‚Äôt fulfill the full contract. That ‚Äòs why.,btohqsg
Or they might have to write report,btohqsg

Hi  I am currently in Secondary 4 and applying for EAE (I want to apply Information tech in SP and NP) . My question is could I include my side projects related to coding and would I be put at disadvantaged if my academic results is not good? Thank you for answering my questions,btohqsg
You shud put Ur certs and not your projects.,btohqsg
And results aren't really being seen during eae,btohqsg
It's more of talent n interest.,btohqsg
Projects you can show them when you get your interview:),btohqsg
I didnt take part in any competitions related to the course I want to apply unfortunately:(,btohqsg
and my cca is performing-art so,btohqsg
You can still put it down and write up what makes you stand out from others,btohqsg
Don't put projects there cuz it's mainly for your write up of interest:),btohqsg
put it down as in telling them I dont have any relevant experience üò¢. Do you have any tips for writing personal statement?,btohqsg
Im planning to write blockchain and stuff but not sure if this relevant or not tho,btohqsg
You can write on what makes you interested in the course,btohqsg
Cuz like I said it's for your interest and not what you know._.,btohqsg
I think everyone probably writes the same thing why they are interested in that course tbh. Plus  some of them even have participated in some competitions  which can include in their personal statement  so Im kinda cluesless about what to write to ‚Äúimpress‚Äù whoever reads my personal statement,btohqsg
Sorry to be a wet blanket but unless you have completed a mega project that really makes you stand out else interest alone means nothing,btohqsg
