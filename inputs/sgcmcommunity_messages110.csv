the FL or the pre fl,btohqsg
arteon is nice but soooooo ex,btohqsg
R32 and 36 are for peasants,btohqsg
sg get the fwd variants dk why hais,btohqsg
actually the price now ok leh  2 years ago was 18k depre  now 20k  not much more,btohqsg
the facelift one also had a power drop sia only 180hp ish iirc,btohqsg
old one got gti level power,btohqsg
that's not bad  if the car 3-4 years older i will buy le,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion but I kinda like the C160,btohqsg
Used to have a few  suddenly all sold within short span of each other,btohqsg
but for the price tag i‚Äôd get a mk7.5 gti instead sia haha,btohqsg
u had a GLB last time right,btohqsg
Yup. Was searching for a replacement for it,btohqsg
Lift back was the the top priority. At first. Lol,btohqsg
Too small for my fat fingers,btohqsg
how was the rear space for you haha,btohqsg
In 5 seat form  very good,btohqsg
7 seat form  not sure if can even call it a boot,btohqsg
The floor quite deep  gives better leg room that way,btohqsg
I think even the Jimny rear space is bigger,btohqsg
Also the people in the last 2 seats don't get legs,btohqsg
Ah the second row was awesome,btohqsg
How much do yall think the mk4 supra will be in singapore‚Äôs market,btohqsg
Actually ok  just need to shift the second row forward abit,btohqsg
I'm sure someone will go put it up at 488 888,btohqsg
Pretend you can get it in normal plate,btohqsg
Seeing that someone put up a million dollar r34,btohqsg
you posted on carousell? light blue one issit,btohqsg
slightly disappointing sia to say the least when i saw it today,btohqsg
i see. mistaken. cause that guy handle also imran,btohqsg
At least they give them cupholders,btohqsg
Buying a car right now  unless something that has the potential to go up in value  is a bad way to spend money in general,btohqsg
Globally prices coming down slowly  markets cooling off in the UK and Europe,btohqsg
no way u can justify spending 290k on a skoda or 260k on a subaru lol,btohqsg
The middle row can still be shifted forward enough for a small adult to shit,btohqsg
Mr Shane doesn't have any small adults around,btohqsg
i tested the configuration multiple times,btohqsg
Back then I had 2 child seats,btohqsg
Well what you said earlier could work,btohqsg
But not what you would want,btohqsg
they say the best way to sit is to squat,btohqsg
or rather i only saw the 180,btohqsg
now that is what u call anaemic,btohqsg
He would text to communicate with the driver,btohqsg
All variants from ad no rear aircon  even the glb35,btohqsg
Merc aircon is one of the worst,btohqsg
They don't believe kids in the back deserve air,btohqsg
porsche air con damn strong haha i miss having strong aircon,btohqsg
Are ambient lights the only thing they do well?,btohqsg
I love love love love ambient lights,btohqsg
But the infotainment is quite bad,btohqsg
I can't disagree  they do them pretty well,btohqsg
i hate the mousepad akso sia haha not very usable,btohqsg
Then vag decided to develop in-house,btohqsg
honestly the infotainment of some cars are cui until i rather use those pioneer head units,btohqsg
pioneer head units actually good stuff hahaha,btohqsg
i prefer old one sia actually haha,btohqsg
ehhh i miss having driving profile on bmw sia,btohqsg
now stupid subaru give me some terms and condition to agree with everytime i on car,btohqsg
Grab then you see driver profile,btohqsg
Good range  you top up only S$20.00 ah?,btohqsg
I came to the conclusion at any road hogging on lane 1  the hogger 80% of the time is either a taxi  Sienta or Freed üò≥,btohqsg
Cannot leh. Weekend is busiest for me. Max riders woohoo!!!!!,btohqsg
Ytd tpe got major accident i think,btohqsg
My friend drove past saw some coverups,btohqsg
Some? Not one blue tent? Oops,btohqsg
I think they no blue tent,btohqsg
No lah  this one after using half tank meaning approx 40 litres,btohqsg
A guy wanted to go n help,btohqsg
He saw the scene he run away,btohqsg
To the road shoulder n puked,btohqsg
Idw send vid here cus i think can see.,btohqsg
Fri the 13th alot accident sia,btohqsg
holy now then you mention it,btohqsg
and it got to be Yishun,btohqsg
WHERE IS CAR OF THE DAY,btohqsg
Wat u guys think of BMW series 2,btohqsg
2 series got coupe and mpv  which one you referring to,btohqsg
The coupe  Gran coupe or active/Gran tourer,btohqsg
This gen vert not out yet or else have that too,btohqsg
It looks basic but still nice,btohqsg
It doesn't really stand out tho,btohqsg
What's stopping me from getting X1 or X2 over 218,btohqsg
And if I wanted a good car for hauling people  just get sienta üòÇ,btohqsg
Engine sounds like a taxi. Get at least a 3,btohqsg
it looks like an entry level,btohqsg
the backend looks like avante. haha,btohqsg
the 2 series price quite attractive,btohqsg
I was inform that no stock till June   july  for Sienta by the SA,btohqsg
No sienta  then get freed lah,btohqsg
welp. that just shows how popular it is,btohqsg
Hi there considering merc a class sedan or cla  better than 2 Series and x3? Any promos for motorshow,btohqsg
no one went to the car show?,btohqsg
after seeing so many cars  suddenly feel that i'm driving crap,btohqsg
If you're getting it for features and the interior  the a class/CLA might be better,btohqsg
A class slightly more room than the CLA,btohqsg
The driving dynamics of the 2 are pretty good and it has some ambient lighting too which people usually look for in the segment,btohqsg
A3 is a a good platform as well and the 1.0 turbo is pretty punchy in a car that size,btohqsg
There is a promo on for Audi and Merc at the motorshow,btohqsg
Price not much changes compared to the car show in July 2022,btohqsg
only C180  A class  GLB  EVs there,btohqsg
Thanks arnav for the tips n price list very helpful to all. I'll look at the a class tml n new a3 looks good price of 161k is not bad,btohqsg
Yes they're not displaying too much  they did more roadshows for their  promos towards the end of last year,btohqsg
160k after COE for cat A is still a 80k car... for a 1.0 üòí,btohqsg
Yupp Audis have a pretty good deal on as of now for all segments  brings price closer to that during the lower COE prices,btohqsg
The times we live in sir,btohqsg
Cannot compare too much to back then,btohqsg
Just can look at the best deal you can get now if you die die want to buy a car right now,btohqsg
unless COE drop to 50K or lower. haha,btohqsg
these are not times to be buying new  cars too,btohqsg
Arguably the cheapest in that segment as well don't forget that,btohqsg
When looking at the a class and 2 series,btohqsg
Agree but some people don't mind and wish to,btohqsg
Let them pump some money into businesses,btohqsg
In 2020 was best time  I rem the old a3 was only 100k leong and A4 130k lol,btohqsg
quite ironically when you think audi being the premium VAG brand,btohqsg
All cars were getting a mild hybrid facelift,btohqsg
A4 was 130k  could get at 120 depending on your nego and car you trade in,btohqsg
Jus curious for merc n bm in 2020 wad was the cheapest price for a class n 2 Series Nd 218,btohqsg
If you're buying for looks and badge sure,btohqsg
Was 35k I rem cos my coe was in Oct 2020 haha,btohqsg
I personally prefer the previous gen coupe more,btohqsg
1 series looks great as well,btohqsg
Are you in an A4 now?,btohqsg
cannot too rash. it's not like shopping for bags üòÇ,btohqsg
so much cheaper than 3 series or C class. ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
Because the g20 3 series had just been launched,btohqsg
While Audi and Merc were clearing stocks for the c class and A4,btohqsg
dunno when can upgrade my car.. sianz,btohqsg
As the b9.5 mild hybrid was incoming with the slightly updated interior for Audi,btohqsg
Nah I got the octavia for 90k üòä good car but wanna change heh,btohqsg
And for the c class it was a whole new gen coming,btohqsg
I wouldn't recommend going from your Octavia to an A3/216/CLA,btohqsg
Power is lower or the same,btohqsg
Your Octavia is the 1.4 I suppose,btohqsg
And realistically you're not getting a much better interior in any of these also,btohqsg
All 3 have significant hard plastics,btohqsg
Octavia at 90k just stick with it. No point saddling yourself with a bigger financial burden on a whim,btohqsg
And the Merc side has had quality control issues with creaking plastics,btohqsg
oh ya..anyone managed to get subaru price list?,btohqsg
Hmm mine was 1.0 version haha  den with a budget of 170 to 180k wad good conti could u rec bro?,btohqsg
170 to 180k if you go used maybe can get a better upgrade leh,btohqsg
Unless you stretch for the A4 2.0,btohqsg
In that case you'd actually be upgrading,btohqsg
True but its about time I move start to move to the big 3 conti brands  only live one life jus try loh. I still make 10k profit so jus pump in next car,btohqsg
The b9.5 is pretty decent however it is down on power at 148hp compared to the b9 generation that was 190hp stock,btohqsg
realistically only Audi. c class and 3 are too much of a stretch,btohqsg
You sell high and buy high remember,btohqsg
some of The audi prices at the roadshow dun include servicing .. warranty changed from 5 years to 3 years.. hais,btohqsg
That is apparently up for negotiation,btohqsg
And an extended warranty pack can be included as part of the deal based on a friend who enquired on the A4,btohqsg
my fren gonna get the Q3 coupe tmr.. will see wats the final package with my audi sales agent,btohqsg
Also c&c's 10 year warranty is a scam to me because it only holds valid if you service at c&c,btohqsg
And it only covers engine and gearbox which don't usually go wrong with these cars if you're not modding,btohqsg
But you spend a lot more in the premium to service at c&c,btohqsg
true.. so far so gd for my A3 1.0,btohqsg
So to me it is a no benefit item that's pushed down your throat,btohqsg
aircon went dead at 2 days b4 my 5 years warranty ended. heng ah,btohqsg
This one the 10 year warranty from c&c also no cover,btohqsg
Thanks will look at A4  based on the omv seems its breakeven price. U know how much is the 3 series going at show?,btohqsg
250+  c class closer to 300,btohqsg
thats why the a4 is a steal,btohqsg
Do make sure to look at the spec though. 2.0s usually tend to be an ok spec but PA cheaps out at times,btohqsg
For the 3 series worth checking price independently with both dealers,btohqsg
As only one is representing the brand at the motorshow I heard,btohqsg
Remember bmw now sold by pml and eurokars,btohqsg
Thanks guys  A4 seems more value indeed. 250k for 3 series abit too much w the coe now. 2020 merc e class was at 240k  I tink ill wait for next cycle,btohqsg
I still don't recommend jumping out and buying a new car now  not the best market and interest rates quite high,btohqsg
And you sell high to buy high,btohqsg
But if you can push it and tank a higher dp  go for it,btohqsg
Cannot compare 2020 to now bah,btohqsg
In this case  would a 1 yr old used car c or e series make more sense for the same price,btohqsg
Both cars gen change  c class new gen and e class major facelift,btohqsg
I would say a 2.5 year old would be a good bet because they tank most of the depre by then and remain more stable till the 5 year mark,btohqsg
both E and C class new gen. thats why@river88rat,btohqsg
Yes my uncle bought e200 for 240k new in 2020  e180 for 220k I rem also,btohqsg
Plus you'll get a pre FL/older gen car so it has depreciated a bit more,btohqsg
But this is also a negative in case you like to drive the newest and greatest,btohqsg
Also the fit and finish of the older c class to me is not upto the mark for what you pay and the c160 and 180 variants really don't perform well,btohqsg
i noticed some cars depreciation getting higher towards COE end  sellers want to capitalise on COE renewal,btohqsg
That's because those cars tend to have a high body value at scrap time as well,btohqsg
And the ARF rebate is decently high too,btohqsg
There's cars on the market with 1 year left going for 80 to 100k as their arf rebates at the end are close to 70k,btohqsg
Plus body will fetch 20k+ at times,btohqsg
ya  and while 2 years left maybe 90-95k,btohqsg
Hmm how abt going for a 10 Yr  coe car like porcsche cayenne or S class. Find those low mileage n gd svc records,btohqsg
haha repair cost will be 2-3x an A4,btohqsg
Remember your FC and service cost will be much higher,btohqsg
As they do have bigger engines,btohqsg
However if you find a clean unit and don't mind the higher regular maintenance cost,btohqsg
cayenne s class easily 2-4k for medium complexity jobs,btohqsg
Ya I tot porsche n merc have extended warranties right are they good enough?,btohqsg
Well it depends on the condition of your car and you'd have to find an agent serviced unit for the agent to offer you an extended warranty,btohqsg
the parts even if the equivalent are 2-3x more expensive than the entry level ones,btohqsg
But yes it'll be higher than your average A4,btohqsg
I'd say the cost is usually more around 1.7x to 2.5x,btohqsg
If you go to agent for service it'll be different,btohqsg
Also avoid cars with air suspension for both of them if you look at them,btohqsg
what about middle aged E class 5 series?,btohqsg
Merc is under C&C so.. 10Y warranties are only realised if you service with them on the 5Y mark onwards.,btohqsg
At that age the air suspension tends to fail and that is a big job labour and parts wise,btohqsg
2017-18 5 series will do you well,btohqsg
Applies to KIA  Mit and the brands under C&C.,btohqsg
The g30 pre lci that is,btohqsg
any thoughts on F10? vs G30,btohqsg
But you'd have to find a clean unit that hasn't had any cheap tuning done to it,btohqsg
Much prefer the g30 if you look at the 2 litre engines as they're newer and a slightly better place to be in if you're going for comfort,btohqsg
However if you're looking at the 6 cyls  the 535 f10 is certainly cheaper than the 540 g30,btohqsg
ya would prefer the b48 vs the N20,btohqsg
But at the same time finding a clean 535 f10 is very hard,btohqsg
Similarly you can get a w213 mid FL (mbux and newer steering wheel) but now what they are selling now,btohqsg
You might have better luck finding a clean c&c serviced unit for one of those,btohqsg
And then you can choose to go independent or not,btohqsg
Thanks guys üôè lots of options to tink about. Will look at w213 used or the new A4. Btw saw the byd atto 3 today  looks very nice for 163k,btohqsg
I heard there are a few clean rides around but owners not selling leh,btohqsg
The owners are wise to keep them running  great cars,btohqsg
Soundz very exp for 163k. üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
All diesel cars sounds the same,btohqsg
I was looking at the Maybach Infinite the other day... this one not crappie,btohqsg

Chill .. i not doing anything,btohqsg
At least not for a year or so,btohqsg
Can is can. But warranty leh?,btohqsg
I jus wanna change rims and wiper. Current wiper is ridiculous,btohqsg
the piaa sitech wiper is pretty good  i used it on 2 cars alr,btohqsg
not cheap but the effect is real,btohqsg
Same. But I think the rubber gone case already can‚Äôt really see the swipe of the water droplets,btohqsg
The 2 road tax is cheaper leh‚Ä¶dunno why,btohqsg
Aiya‚Ä¶everyone like new stuffs and toys,btohqsg
Is it hardened?Got holes?If not just rub toothpaste.Apply rainXyou don't need to use wiper much.Now is hot season. Monsoon over.Next monsoon march/AprilQing Ming Festival,btohqsg
the idea that now not rainy season is laughable,btohqsg
sure it might not rain as much but when it rains it pours. having good wipers for good visibility  still important,btohqsg
I hate it when it rains at night. The reflection making me hard to see,btohqsg
Last night I drove without on headlights and din realised it,btohqsg
No wonder so many drivers tried to signal me,btohqsg
I put rainXAlot of layer.It's good for water splash from buses beside or vehicles frlm opposite direction,btohqsg
Lmao my friend de car last time auto then period of time cudnt on,btohqsg
Then realised got smth blocking sensor,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/VxTX-D_ddssRain XApply all windows and side mirro,btohqsg
god so many things to apply. just get a pair of new wipers la,btohqsg
or if your windscreen has chips or is dirty  go polish it,btohqsg
too many DIY products  where got time?,btohqsg
Normal. But I auntie age. It‚Äôs the lao hua,btohqsg
True. My back hurts after one round of washing,btohqsg
$40 for a pair of new wipers  change every 1-2 years  is nothing,btohqsg
compare that to the time  effort and money spent on coating and what have you not,btohqsg
She is on budget ma.I changed to Bosch. But still apply rainX.,btohqsg
change wiper and still use coating... is not budget,btohqsg
just... don't fall for the marketing ploys of all the car accessories,btohqsg
if you're trying to save money,btohqsg
When coe drops and you wanna sell. The number of people i seen that lose so much money and only sell the car for paper+export is so high.Now prolly the most reckless time to buy.,btohqsg
if the rain is a bit heavier  or travelling at 70+ on highway  you will still have to on wiper... then your coating is gone,btohqsg
Ain‚Äôt that the blunt truth sir. üëçüèº,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs a sign to change car,btohqsg
My side mirror and side windowDon't have wiper üòÇ,btohqsg

GOOD MORNING TO ALL AND ESPECIALLY TO ALL THE CHINESE NEW YEAR FLOWERS AND FRUITS!,btohqsg
COE so expensive some would say what a waste to buy a proton,btohqsg
But I want to ask who got selling proton,btohqsg
Ok what. Keeps the purchase price reasonable. COE is prorate so will suffer less depre on the car itself.,btohqsg
Wait does that make sense? Not sure if I‚Äôm math-ing correctly with my villager maths,btohqsg
Sad. Real case of So Close Yet So Far,btohqsg

Gotta hit the time when the fleet of PHV expires,btohqsg
2024 another 1% gst . If recesssion take place full blown . Ah gong also needs to hit the kpi .coe might stay put or continue to grow,btohqsg

Dont think they will risk the votes. They prolly will do smth. Unless YOLOü´°,btohqsg
They provide incentive again   people will follow them  opposition are weak too .,btohqsg
Is there a quota on how much cloth to wear? Auto salon much better,btohqsg
Seems like it's targeted more towards the upper tier class customers able to install a charger in the comfort of their own home,btohqsg
Can't imagine having to compete for chargers in a HDB with such a low range üò∞,btohqsg
I referring to the eye candy,btohqsg
Have seen ICE parked at EV charging station before and blatantly bochap!,btohqsg
how long does it take to fully charge Tesla Model 3,btohqsg
a full charge can last 4 to 5 days normal consumption ,btohqsg
Depends if you're using a fast charge. I think normal charge should be around 8 hours,btohqsg
Tesla may be faster  I may be wrong. But BYD normal charge would be around 8 hours thereabouts. Haven't tried fast charging on it,btohqsg
how u normally do ur 8 hour charge  trying to figure out the convenient way in practice,btohqsg
My in-laws have a private residence so charging is super convenient for them. Otherwise I guess the next convenient location would have to be HDB carparks!,btohqsg
last question  ur hdb carpark have 2 charging  can u book im advance,btohqsg
Wah  that I'm not sure already cause I havent tried it myself!,btohqsg
520 only. WHERE IS THE VTEC!,btohqsg

Oos all along. Super hard to get,btohqsg
so have to get from SG? those silver enhanced one?,btohqsg
fast sia.. last week my colleague got from the bt timah outlet,btohqsg
The new TnG cards are currently only available via the 'blackmarket' route (ie shopee / lazada). If you're desperate  can go there to buy.,btohqsg
Many have been trying hard to find in Malaysia...always OOS. So just patiently wait if you're not in a hurry.,btohqsg
Buy the ezlink-tng card if u wanna enter desperately. Btw anyone know where can top up tng card? Petrol stn can anot ah?,btohqsg
this kind also can use to pay toll and parking in msia right?,btohqsg
can top up using the app somemore don need go top up manually,btohqsg
Correct. Many parking places (ie shopping malls) are using the TnG card. If you don't have one...good luck getting out from the entrance.,btohqsg
mlysian will laugh at us for buying proton at sg price,btohqsg
I also wonder which champion when I see proton with Singapore plate here,btohqsg
Patriotism and nationalism has no monetary value to it de,btohqsg
when Coe 10k or 20k buy proton still make a bit sense. now aready 100k for 10 year leaseüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Dont mind me asking . What exactly is depreciation on a car,btohqsg
Is it through the specific car itself or the model,btohqsg
So its just which model priced at how much they all have identical depri,btohqsg
Depre = cost - scrap value / useful life,btohqsg
Cannot  only designated tng top up place  Singapore side only one at the checkpoint,btohqsg
You miss it and too late alr,btohqsg

Or buy on Carousell in SG on black market,btohqsg
Sold out cus of the friggin scalpers,btohqsg
Each person can buy 2 only,btohqsg
But people know locals in Malaysia,btohqsg
But not on the highway and near checkpoints,btohqsg
I rather sell it to you,btohqsg
Need to go inside city then can,btohqsg
Wait if NFC top up is via app issit,btohqsg
Then U just tap the card on ur phone?,btohqsg
Or petrol station on other side,btohqsg
Yes so you put money in your app wallet with credit card,btohqsg
Then you tap the card on the phone and top up,btohqsg
Can use to pay for snacks along the way,btohqsg
Then the eWallet app like grab pay for local stores,btohqsg
So easier to tap tap at tolls,btohqsg
This one if you got skill issue or arm short,btohqsg
Downloading it was the best decision ever,btohqsg
I see so many local cars,btohqsg
Park far far away from the reader,btohqsg
Then stretch here stretch there to tap,btohqsg
By local I mean SG cars,btohqsg
