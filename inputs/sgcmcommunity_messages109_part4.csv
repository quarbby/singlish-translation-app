A bit too late to remove stickers now,btohqsg
They seem to just get stuck,btohqsg
People trying to remove those protective films from their Merc screens now,btohqsg
Leaving glue resin in some cases,btohqsg
Because they didn't go put a proper screen protector just left the delivery film on,btohqsg
Those are the same people who don't remove the gloss surface protective films from their electronics at home,btohqsg
Heat gun.Those vinyl wrap shops use heat gun to remove vinyl wrap,btohqsg
Will be tedious and the sticker might crumble into the fabric but worth a shot,btohqsg
ü•∫ A BMW car allegedly hit a woman & 1 of her 2 dogs at Loyang Ave.The car dragged her pet Chow Chow for a distance before driving off.‚û°Ô∏èhttp://bit.ly/3Qx8D3YFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Messed up driver hit and run,btohqsg
At least this Rocco driver was stopped and advised.,btohqsg
He damn lucky his path was straight,btohqsg
If it was 5 seconds earlier or later,btohqsg
He bang the pedestrian or the taxi uncle alr,btohqsg
hanor. Just thank god no one was hurt,btohqsg
Apparently he had an epileptic episode/heart attack,btohqsg
The Camry saved him from going straight into the wall on the ramp,btohqsg
Who saved the camry driver sia  but honestly lucky camry pax side no passenger,btohqsg
I believe everyone came out safe,btohqsg
Camry driver can't even claim the roc right,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think can if it‚Äôs not the Roc‚Äôs fault  also maybe since it‚Äôs not within his control?,btohqsg
If only we had a button that says ‚Äúpostpone heart attack by 10 minutes‚Äù,btohqsg
No... If the report is true that he on drugs/alcohol,btohqsg
Then insurance will void the claim,btohqsg
Camry driver can only claim his own insurance and file civil suit,btohqsg
So if you DUI you‚Äôre liable v,btohqsg
If you get into accident while DUI then you're already committing a criminal act,btohqsg
Who proceeds to sue the DUI driver,btohqsg
If you're not at fault do you still lose your NCD?,btohqsg
Wah so much in a hurry ah..got zoom mtg is it?,btohqsg
or he need to pang sai,btohqsg

There is no levorg wagon coming is there?,btohqsg
Frankly matters little to me have or not lol.,btohqsg
Noted with thanks. Mr xipeng doesn't care for Subaru and therefore don't listen to what he says about Subaru,btohqsg
not a true wrx tho if u ask me hahaha even though i like it a lot,btohqsg
Sports wagon... But the CVT is disappointing,btohqsg
Why they can't put in a more sporty transmission is beyond me  other brands all doing it,btohqsg
at least it revs all the way now,btohqsg
performance + CVT is like truffle + fries,btohqsg
still a poor example of the real thing.... just like CVT,btohqsg
Actually Subaru‚Äôs car is one of the best already. Idk why it‚Äôs different from others,btohqsg
at 257k..... just give it a torque converter or DCT luh....,btohqsg
