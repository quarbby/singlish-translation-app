Sometimes not knowing about the future motivates you further,btohqsg
any advice for someone contemplating suicide  tldr; childhood trauma been through counselling since pri and sec sch but life js gets worse and worse  the pressure and toxic jc culture js makes me want to overdose. honestly the only thing keeping me going is the fact that i still have a gf whom i don't want to hurt. if you don't care to answer genuinely id rather u blue tick me thanks.,btohqsg
id say suicidal thoughts are usually passing in which case try to run from any high ledges  pills or super sharp things if you can,btohqsg
so your chance to be reckless is less,btohqsg
its better to stop immediate probability of attempting,btohqsg
"Thinking about ending your life is considered a thought that comes for a  spur of the moment or comes because of a trigger. Once that trigger is no longer present or over some time  you will no longer think of it until the next time you get triggered or experience this sudden spur of the moment thought.Like what josh say  just stay away from anything physically which would give you a easy way to end your life. ""sharp objects/ledges"" etc until you feel better or have something else preoccupied in your mind",btohqsg
everyone has different circumstances  background stories and factors to consider before being able to sort of pinpoint what we ( i say we because many of us are probably low-key going through this differently ) can do betterit's definitely going to be a struggle and it may seem rough but think of what you may want to do before actually off-ing yourself because you said you have a gf and i understand completely that you don't want to hurt her but have you considered that hurting yourself is like giving her twice the pain? if she were to ever find out because the guilt and emotions that slowly bite away at your mental health will slowly affect hers and back to your well-beingi just finished a sadomasochistic novel about letting go of your own expectations first  does a lot in building up confidence and self-lovethe trauma has happened  it's the past  we have to admit it but we don't deny it or cloud ourselves over it. maybe start contemplating or doing like reflections on simple things like what you want to be when you graduate  how can you live life up to the fullest because I know telling you who has suicidal thoughts is already akin to pouring salt on their woundsit's like  when you ask for advice or a listening ear from people in general and they just tend to vocalize on things that you've already thought about and tried to do but it just doesn't work out for you  i tend to just cry silently while venting to the SOS ( Samaritans of Singapore ) hotlines pretty much most of my mental breakdowns in this year but you should knowthis battle is never yours alone to fight :)- a stranger,btohqsg
what's the point in running away from it when you know if you continue to live it's just gonna be more suffering,btohqsg
honestly not much advice from my end but just wanted to say that I feel you  I gets how you're feeling  and that things will get betterdespite all the shit life throws at you  you have ppl around you who care  and ppl who will miss you,btohqsg
honestly it's not like i haven't tried to make myself better  i do lots of cardio  go to the gym   meditate  journal  all to just feel nothing. even after getting laid i still feel so miserable like what even lol,btohqsg
well good on you for trying  that's a start,btohqsg
i aso dk how i got out of my depression era,btohqsg
"sometimes I feel like trying too many things that's supposed to be ""good"" and ""positive"" has a negative effect lol",btohqsg
that's the thing about lifeit's mostly living with a purpose planned by yourself or a close loved oneotherwise it's just living aimlesslyit's just how we choose to take things into our own hands because taking the first step in initiating for support will be difficult  it will NEVER be something easyit's just that the way people describe their experiences with mental breakdowns and suicidal tendencies/thoughts tend to usually speak the lesser negative of their stories because they're usually to share positive changesif you feel like running away from stuff works for you  who is to say that you are wrong to do so? this is a very gray area and  since like what you've mentioned even if you do a lot of productivity stuff  you still happen to feel bleak and empty  right?why not try stepping out of that box? instead of just exercising  journalling  mediation and socializing-- maybe you can try to find a new interest  new social circle? who knowsmental health well-being is a very precarious matter as it's easily broken like feelings of trust but unlike feelings which can be earned back  most of the time mental health wellness just gets stagnated whenever you think you're improving  doing better and recovering? you just spiral downwardsit's a vicious cycle  i admit as I've gone through this since p4 and im already 18 as of this yeari would say it really depends on each individual because everyone has different coping mechanisms  styles or stress management. some handle it better  some don't  the others are just in between,btohqsg
i agree ! i have no planned purpose so it feels like im living aimlessly  i have been trying to find one to no success initialing for support is difficult  but i have done so  booking for counselling slots since p2 im j1 now  i have also tried looking for various ways of improving my mental health and doing them.i have tried stuff to improve my mental health  but im not sure why you call it productivity stuff? its just to keep my sanity together and distract me from my thoughtsi have tried to find new interests  i think i probably have the more interests than 99% of singaporeans but none of them helps me,btohqsg
The point is to give you a window of time to overcome it  it does not matter if you succceed in overcoming your trauma  the fact of the matter is that you still tried something. Eventually once you try enough times  you will succeed. Some people take months  take years or even decades to eventually overcome it.If you choose to end it  you basically decided to stop giving you that window of time to try  once you do that. You are shortchanging your potential to succeed. Why do you want to do that?,btohqsg
eh I mean you can have interests that are just that - interestsdoesn't need to help you in any way  as long as you enjoy it imo,btohqsg
great point  any suggestions on things to try or do ?,btohqsg
If you want to do something productive  play games.- Keeps your mind active and engagedIf you want to do something just for the sake of shifting your thought process  watch shows.- Keeps your mind hooked to a certain plotline,btohqsg
makes me wonder if most people are trying to avoid suicidal thoughts as that's what most people do in their free timeplay games and watch shows,btohqsg
"productivity stuff is just another term ( at least  according to me alone ) that is used to define interests  hobbies  things that you may or may not enjoy doing because they actually take up your time and energy more often than you think  if you don't actually realize it. that's why the term ""productivity"" because at the very least  you know you're doing something to advert your attention off your emotions or situation where the past seems to keep haunting youit may not seem much  but it always starts small with baby steps. you're already doing quite well but maybe you just need another outlet to let out your emotions instead of throwing them onto what you do ( study  work  interests  socialisation etc )i don't encourage this but if you have the money to buy boxing gloves or an extra pillow/bolster  you can just use it to thrash your emotions out on it like some punching bag silently instead of accumulating till you feel unbearably desolate with living any further morewhat i love doing is being selfish for myself and my own well-being before placing others' unless it's a national or concern big enough to alert the majority into them assuming im not okay just because i don't like the crowdwhat you must know is that im a scarily rational person to the point where even if my emotions are all over the places  i can logically and effectively point out the details  effects  causes etc to people and oftentimes  i'd just zip my mouth because i know deep inside  i may have been a disappointment but at least i know for the least that i get to live on despite breaking many's hearts",btohqsg
that's like the sad truthgamingwatching filmssocial mediasleepingeatingare the few main things many resort to doing to destress  lol,btohqsg
im so conscious of my thoughts and feelings that nothing i do can really distract me from them unlike other people who can be completely immersed in whatever their doingi used to punch my bed too   but i find railing my gf damn hard for like two hours straight more effective sorry if abit nsfw but after that instead of feeling better i just feel worse like ???like you   i would consider myself scarily rational too  im a science person  play chess  read up on rationalism  different schools of philosophy  used to paper trade and do technical analysis on stocks. and rn it feels rational to off myself lmao,btohqsg
"that is basically what happens most of the time  because both engages your brain away from any physical thoughts of harming yourself in real life.For games  if shifts it by reintroducing or concealing that sucidal or harmful thought as a virtual action.for movies  it shifts it by reintroducing or concealing suicidal and harmful thoughts as a script.For both instances it takes away the feelings which results in your thoughts and translates them into a virtual world or a virtual expectation.Where your mind now signals that ""I am feeling this way because of the game or because of the show"" and no longer have any ""i am feeling this way because of what my life""",btohqsg
well  they don't work for me at all bcz i already used to do them a lot so im very desensitised to them,btohqsg
to be fair  i still play games too hahaha not that i've quit  just like im so sick of life i dont even feel like playing anymore,btohqsg
They dont work because the games you play or shows you watch include triggers,btohqsg
if your trauma is childhood trauma and you play a game like Sims. That game wont help you one bit,btohqsg
if it does work for you  that's just it. period  end of the story. if you find engaging in intimate acts with your gf helps you feel better  you can try talking to her if she's up for it? see what you guys can work with because you're lost but definitely getting somewhere finding his way out of the foggy pathit may feel rational to off yourself but it's usually the emotions overriding your nationality because attempting suicide takes a lot of despair to be able to made that act  successfully donedont mind me replying to a single message but actually replying to both of your messages because my eyes are slowly giving way but i just want to stay with my pair of swollen eyes a little longer,btohqsg
uh miss  he alr said he got laid and still feel miserable,btohqsg
lol i just treat her like some punching bag bro   like i feel so bad and then after that i barely give two fucks ab her,btohqsg
This is why i said to avoid triggers,btohqsg
hmm actually im not really sure where you got the concept of triggers bcz its like a passive always there thing for me that's just gets stronger overtime,btohqsg
anyway it's late pls go to sleep yall,btohqsg
you want to play games  play games that dont include violence of any kind...your mind is alr mentally incapable of distinguishing virtual to reality  you need to stay far away from these type of games,btohqsg
i don't even have the guts to actl kms so it's fine,btohqsg
i just have one word for youhow does it feel for both you and your gf alike? it seems like a rebound relationship to me and you guys aren't willing to let go of the other firstmaybe it's the whole wrong time and right person thing all over again but yeah i mean it's just a thought,btohqsg
you dont have the guts...but its rubbing on the people around you,btohqsg
wednesday me literally looked like an idiot walking at 4am all the way from home to northshore plaza,btohqsg
hmm i usually just play chess so no violence there,btohqsg
is that a game you played since your childhood,btohqsg
damn i think she js treats me pretty much as a dildo ngl and sometimes when she's ovulating she does something nice so it's quite mutual ig lol,btohqsg
ryan you're also missing the fact that he doesn't have interest in things or people as stated in the above replies he's givenyou and i both  we have our illiteracy moments 🫡,btohqsg
started during circuit breaker after most of the trauma,btohqsg
if this wasn't an academic study related chat  i'd go more into this topic lol,btohqsg
