10x points = 4miles per dollar. Only get 0.4miles per dollar if u insist.,btohqsg

Try to explore if can use Kris+ to  pay travel agent eg. CTC  on or before 30 Apr to earn 4+3 = 7 mpd up to maximum $1k spend using HSBC revo.,btohqsg
For PayNowQR it will deduct from your bank account (not from credit card). You should still get the GooglePay (Pay UEN) promotion though,btohqsg
After 01 May  it will be reduced to 1+4 mpd = 5 mpd,btohqsg

https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/2515162-what-can-i-pay-with-ipaymy- it says Insurance (excluding NTUC Income),btohqsg
Does this mean whichever kind of QR I scan  it’s impossible to deduct from cc? i.e Mobile contactless is strictly Tap/PayWave kind of transaction?,btohqsg
AFAIK Payments for the purpose of GrabPay top-ups are not eligible purchases; no cashback will be awarded ->https://go.amex/sgexclusions,btohqsg

Does your insurer accept Amex? If yes  Amex TCB and UOB Absolute still gives cashback for it. Otherwise  Maybank platinum visa still gives cashback for insurance payments but you must hit the quarterly tier. On the miles side  Maybank VI gives 1.2 mpd. If you don't qualify for that  UOB KF debit card gives 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
I see thanks - will look into these...,btohqsg
if u dont mind paying a little extra  use citi payall. they are running a promo currently.,btohqsg

Hello  how long does it usually takes for the HSBC CC to be approved uh?,btohqsg
Yes after using the XNAP app to scan the 'appropriate' QR Code  the app would direct you to Google Pay or Apple Pay. You can use any of your 'digital' cards in e-wallet to pay merchants.For me  I use Google Pay (GPay) and my uob one inside my GPay e-wallet.,btohqsg
Question on Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze with payment via Gpay:I'm aware that Citi rewards card does not give the 10x mpd on Gpay transactions.Will I  get 10x mpd if I link it to my Instarem and pay with Instarem via Gpay?I watched the video on the Instarem single card strategy but didn't quite understand if this will work.,btohqsg

Long story short. It’s worth it .But worthiness it’s really up to you leh. Some people find a few hundred dollars meal at odette worth it.. some will never find it worth itYou need to ask yourself whether you willing to pay for miles.,btohqsg

so lets say today i deposit 2k tomorrow i withdraw the 2k  i will still get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Anyone got a quick hack to check mcc code before spending? 🥲,btohqsg
Can use. As long as you receive SMS from HSBC that states the Everyday+ validity period  you can use the cash deposit. Just wait for this SMS to be safe,btohqsg
Not everyone will get the sms  I am afraid. But it doesn’t mean one is not registered.,btohqsg
What is y and j class about ?,btohqsg
Hi all  good day. Could I get your opinion on the top few cashback credit cards. I have no requirements  except age of 18-21. I am able to deposit 30k or more into the account if that helps. thanks in advance,btohqsg

Hello  has anyone received Revolut $10 cashback? For the public transport promo in march,btohqsg
What the best card for tng top up?,btohqsg
Excellent question!I think YouTrip  Trust and Revolut cards are tailored to giving customers  (much) better exchange rate than brick and mortar banks (such as DBS  OCBC and UOB).For better rewards / CB  I think these 3 cards are not designed for that. Happy to hear from the guys here 😊I assume the question here is which of the 3 provides the best exchange rate. Any guys here has personal experience to share based on their usage scenarios ? 😊,btohqsg
Oh that’s fast. I guess we have to chase them,btohqsg
they have 30 business days to credit it,btohqsg
Yea I know but normally the cashback gets paid out together right. For previous promo,btohqsg
How much can you spend a month on credit cards? Also are you looking into savings accounts recommendarions as well? your last sentence seems to imply it,btohqsg
I used to use Youtrip but i realised Wise has better rates,btohqsg
The card should be spending about 350-650/month. I am able to put about 30k into the account since the card holder might not be earning more than 30k/annually,btohqsg
not so much into savings account  but if it comes as a package  it is possible too,btohqsg
Any idea what's supported and not supported?,btohqsg
Hmm  i dun have a Wise card but I read here that YouTrip and Trust fx rates are better than Wise.I assume Jasmine question is specific to the three cards she has and I think she does not want to consider another card.,btohqsg
I did not know or is it for march only,btohqsg
Oh nvm I saw the promotion is only in march,btohqsg
Sorry just to make sure I can still top up money even after 30/4 right ?let’s say I top up on 1st may and withdraw on 1st August Im eligible to earn that 4.35% right ? Since it counting ADB,btohqsg
I dunno abt trust coz i dont hv the card  but rates-wise for sure wise is better than youtrip by quite a bit,btohqsg
Hi  I’m planning to transfer UNI$50 000 to my KF account to book my flights.Since I can only redeem UNI$5000 each time with $25/transaction  I will have to pay $250 in total for admin fee. Is there any way around this? Or should I use the frequent flyer programmer? 😵‍💫,btohqsg
I believe redemption of points is in blocks (or multiples) of UNI$5000  not 5000 each time  so you can redeem all UNI$50k and pay the one time $25 fee,btohqsg
What’s the best miles card strategy now?,btohqsg
6 mpd as much as possible. If not  any card that’s 4 mpd and within as few FIs as possible.Usually if you’re a homebody and avoid hotels I’d say Citi Rewards with or without Amaze is good enough.,btohqsg
does citi smrt work with cardup to pay for school fees/condo rental? 5% minus the admin fee still seems like something,btohqsg
Hi gurus  im going overseas tmr  should i use revolut or amaze+crmc card there?,btohqsg
hi guys  does it earn any additional interest rate for DBS multiplier if i use DBS CPF Investment Account for Endowus?,btohqsg
If I am traveling more. HSBC revolution is better than the citi+amaze combo?,btohqsg
Yes.Do note the rewards cap for 10x HSBC points is 1 000 SGD per month.Also some merchants may not get 10x points on HSBC due to their MCCs not being on the HSBC “white list”,btohqsg
Unfortunately no. Only investments made using DBS InvestSaver qualify.,btohqsg
Only insurance company listed in the app for payall,btohqsg
For mastercard citi rewards linked to instarem amaze card  will it still get 10x rewards for dining spend? Anyone knows? I only know travel related spent is excluded,btohqsg
Yes.. Unless you dine at a hotel,btohqsg

HSBC revolution transfer partner include scoot?,btohqsg
Don't think scoot has points system! HSBC -> SIA and you use it to offset scoot flight $,btohqsg
Yes but be careful with MCC exclusion list imposed by Citi  better check. And yes be careful with travel categories,btohqsg
Do you have other cards  such as HSBC Revolution or UOB Visa Signature?,btohqsg
Only two programs: KrisFlyer and Asia Miles.Fun fact: SQ and CX used to be part of the same FFP: Passages.,btohqsg
If I apply using this link  would I still get the Luggage? I tried submitting with the normal HSBC link and they asked me to select Luggage or cashback. But when I used this link  they didn't ask...,btohqsg
Also SQ was once part of American Airlines' FFP - but only USA-based customers can get miles from their USA-Asia travelsI hope Chris will take some time to recharge in a Spontaneous Escape :D,btohqsg
Does payment of insurance premiums on UOB One count as monthly spending $500?,btohqsg

Hi guys. I applied HSBC EGA and send the sms to register for the extra interest promo. However I was told I am ineligible as I registered before. I am new to the bank. Any idea why is that so?,btohqsg

Hello  can I check if UOB EVOL gives 8% cash back for gym membership payments?,btohqsg
HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Apr EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of JAN23 to MAR23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
Received this SMS upon registration. Does this mean I am successfully registered for EGA extra interest promo?,btohqsg
I saw that and my 2 cents are - Nopes not worth.The fees that you pay are equal to the price of flight whichever sector you travel.So with Payall  one is not earning or saving anything.I would rather look for cards which gives me money back.My thought process is either you should be able to save money or earn money,btohqsg
Oh  how to offset? isit need to pay using trust card @ fairprice?,btohqsg
MorningDoes anyone what is the best card or method to pay for delivery in private hospital. Either to earn cash back or miles.Thank you,btohqsg
The link points are linked to your membership so if you are using the FairPrice app  just select the option to redeem when you are showing your QR code. If you are using the membership card  just tell the cashier that you wanna redeem the points. If you are using self checkout  can either select redemption of points on the terminal or select it via the mobile app,btohqsg
You can also offset your meal purchase at fp kopitam food court. Must use fp app to pay. There is a slider in the app.,btohqsg
For Harvey Norman  what's the best combo to earn miles:1. Kris+ & HSBC Revo up to $10002. Kris+ & Citibank RewardsRight?,btohqsg
Ocbc titanium rewards if your spending exceeds the monthly cap,btohqsg
For HSBA EGA interest promo  does it matter if i transfer money at the end of month VS start of month? I am alrdy registered to the promo in March,btohqsg
Dont use CitiBank Rewards alone with Kris+  use CRMC+Amaze to pay with Kris+,btohqsg
transfer money in ASAP to get bonus interest on the average daily balance,btohqsg
CRMC and amaze combo good for furniture installment purchase? Which cards do u all use? Tx,btohqsg
Anyone use the free lounge access with dbs altitude? Do i just flash the altitude card at entrance or i need to register anything?,btohqsg

My HDB home loan lock in period ends in Aug 2023. Do you think I should refinance now at around 3.7% for fixed or wait for another month or two to see if the rates trend downward,btohqsg
ordering a wise card  anyone knows the MCC code?,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone advise which is better for CRMC when doing online transaction for overseas purchase:1. Charge to the card in foreign currency2. Choose the option to be billed in SGD,btohqsg
Hi  anybody who is an existing hsbc cc holder applying for Ega promo via moneysmart. Have u guys made it?,btohqsg
Hi  the advice on this forum is Amaze pair with CRMC. If you follow  please doNOTchoose to be charged in SGD to avoid a Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) charge and Amaze rewards points.,btohqsg
if i pump petrol at esso using uob prvimiles card  i will still get 1.4 mpd right?,btohqsg
Hi if I were to purchase something online in foreign currency  is credit card advisable? Or the currency exchange rate is poor & costly? Haha,btohqsg
Sorry to clarify  your question is what credit card to use or whether u should use credit card for online purchase in foreign currency?,btohqsg
My bad - Whether to use credit card,btohqsg
better you pay by paynow/debit  don't use credit card... it will be considered as cash advance which is costly,btohqsg
Any particular transactions that should be avoided using the Citi Rewards + Amaze card combo?,btohqsg
If I try to put myself in your shoe. The short ans is yes. Using credit card instead of debit card means you can initiate a charge dispute process with the card issuer without  impacting your bank or e-wallet balance in the event of a non delivery of the online item.,btohqsg
Hello would like to ask  if I put my gym membership on my credit card eg DBS Women’s world  does it count as an online spend? And Netflix too?,btohqsg
Okay thanks for this! Which card would u recommend for overseas purchase?,btohqsg
I suggest u look through the videos Chris has produced for us. The answers to your Q is in one or more of the videos 😊,btohqsg
If you have specific questions after watching the videos  please feel free to post your Qs here. Nearly all  questions r answered here.,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installment also got uob 5%?,btohqsg
Would like to apply a Ctiti Reward card from Singsaver and spend $500 for sign up bonus  may I ask if top up $500 grab ewallet will be considered as an eligible spend for the sign up bonus? Thanks,btohqsg
Adding on to what I wrote 😊Despite the effort to inform the cashier  misunderstandings might happen due to language issues  distracted cashier or fat finger cashier resulting you paying the purchase in your home currency (I assume is SGD). If that unfortunately happens  I wouldnotsuggest for the charge in SGD to be reversed as that action might result u to incur FX loss on top of the DCC earlier charged.For me  I would wait for the amount to be displayed on the credit card terminal. I would make sure the charged amount is not in SGD before handing over or tapping my card.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  no. As far as I know   no card regards Grab top up as an eligible spend for rewards purposes.,btohqsg
I suggest you read through the T&Cs of the card(s) you're signing up for and look for the excluded list portion. That should answer questions like these for future!,btohqsg
Quite a handful.. Travel related are excluded. Clear cut egs I no need to say. I found that Uber rides  car rental  hotel breakfast are excluded.,btohqsg
Rates likely stay near where it is whole of 2023,btohqsg
Suggest you negotiate for shortest lock in so that you can refi when and if rates changes  whether it is fixed package or not,btohqsg
Yea looking at 3.7% for 2 years lock-in,btohqsg
Regarding the maybank platinum visa  if apr spend 300  may and june spend 1000  it will be treated as i spent 300 (lower tier) for the quarter right?,btohqsg
Question on RHB FD promotion. I understand can do this via RHB app. But need to first open a Savings account via app and fund it. Then use the fund to deposit into FDMY question is  can I leave the balance for the savings account zero after I transfer to FD  or will I be charged a fall below fee?,btohqsg
You can check if there is a min balance requirement for the saving account which u open,btohqsg
What if for the 1st month of receiving card i cant hit 1000 but month 2 and 3 i can hit 1000,btohqsg

gov things try to be careful,btohqsg
Anyone has NXT card knows if there's any issue paying the full amount instead of installment outstanding amount?I saw there's some clause for acceleration of payments where there will be fees,btohqsg
Got such thing? Didnt see early payment got penalty,btohqsg
https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-nxtcard.pdfSection 5  maybe its talking about the extended installment then,btohqsg
Just read into details on 5.6I believe there is a charge. But more of an administrative charge. Currently im holding on to the cashflo card (basically prev gen of NXT)Wondering if it applies more towards getting that amount cleared off,btohqsg
Looking for instarem referral. Anyone? TIA!,btohqsg
I think where the charge will come in is under this conditionBuy item a for 500 - split to 3 monthsYou call them to not split the charge and bill as a whole. Then that’s where the admin charge will kick inBut if I pay full some directly and just let the credit overflow meaning I see the bill come in but already deducted due to overflowing credit. That I’m not sure if there will be a charge.Can try with a $1 extra payment then if they charge just make noise,btohqsg
Haha yeah seems like this charge will apply only when you tell them to do full charge.Good idea actually!,btohqsg
You might want to delete the msg. You cannot show referral here,btohqsg

On weekday revoult will have the best fx (near google fx) follow by youtrip then amaze.Amaze have ard 2% -2.5% fx but will give 1% cashback up to $500 spend. You can also earn miles/ cashback on your linked credit card using amaze.,btohqsg
I assume you are referring to the CRMC rewards point. I took a quick look at one of the tour. It seems to be operated by a travel agency.

Anyone knows if we can use amaze card linked to citi rewards for gym membership recurring bull? Still can earn 10x rewards/ 4mpd? 🫢,btohqsg
Will it be beneficial to use this promo in 1 transaction online (ard S$3K) by using CRMC if max you can earn rewards is capped at S$1K per stmt month? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  is there a way to earn miles for car repair payments?,btohqsg
This promo is transactions charged to the card in foreign currency only would gain 3.25% until 30 Jun. So transactions in SGD is excluded.The short ans to your question is yes if your foreign currency spendings are one of the 10X categories.The Citi 10X rewards applies to qualifying types of spendings (note well that travel related spendings are excluded) regardless of currency of the spendings.E.g. If u spend ~USD 750 (foreign currency) in Apple USA online store and self-collect while u r there. The 3.25% cash rebate might not leave  you much benefits after factoring FX spread and admin fees. But u still can get 10X rewards point. The 10X rewards points to S$ ratio is about 2.27%.,btohqsg
its only worth to use dbs points from WWMC cards on miles for 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Depends if u got any other cardI only got one credit card so might as well,btohqsg
Ok. Yes the spending will be in foreign currency and not-travel related. If let’s say it’s shopping for a shoe and bag store so by right shd qualify for 10x rewards.My issue is if the spend is >$1K (in SGD equivalent). If the store allows  will it be better to charge the other amt to DBS altitude or DBS WWMC (linked to Amaze)? Thanks,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this By the way 👌,btohqsg

Are there any diff in terms of opening ega account or signing up revolution card first? Does the sequence matter?,btohqsg
Nope but i would recommend open the account first and start linking giro and doing fast transfer to start clocking the cashback first. Opening at the branch is instant (and you get the debit card on the same day to start making transactions if you need)  opening online will take a few days. but still shorter waiting period than applying for credit card,btohqsg

But the limit of $1K is per stmt month meaning even if i pay for the txn right away  i will still not be eligible to earn more rewards as long as it’s within the same stmt month,btohqsg
There is. You cannot apply for EGA online if you are currently a credit card holder. You'll need to go down to the branch. If you don't want the hassle  apply EGA first  then credit card,btohqsg

Arigatou gozaimashita. Just don't like too many cards,btohqsg

Gosh... how do we know if a purchase will have such fee? I'm using smrt card.,btohqsg
You won’t know  Citi can’t tell you either until after the transaction is completed. Just assume buying from any foreign site would likely attract that 1% fee.I’ve heard some Cruise bookings are processed overseas too. Apple iTunes/AppStore certainly does.,btohqsg
It is an sg website with .sg and charge in sgd. Really surprised,btohqsg

"When comes to fraudulent attempts  I honestly think the highest 2 likeliness is strip/RFID skimming (usually overseas) or storing of CC details on ""not as reputable"" online shopping sites (not saying that reputable sites are invulnerable  but it comes down to risk).To reduce the likelihood of skimming  would suggest to switch to contactless pay on smartphone/watch (if possible)  or use cards like YouTrip  etc to limit the amount of money they steal.For online shopping sites  don't save the CC details on the site and opt to key in every time. Additionally  use a password manager to fill the data  which also protects you against keyloggers. The likelihood of your data on a password manager being compromised is lower than on non reputable sites. If can  use more reputable sites  don't because cheaper on a certain site then risk getting your CC details stolen.Also some good cyber hygiene tips:1. Have different passwords on all sites2. Use a password manager instead of keying in passwords3. ALWAYS have 2FA. Most sites offer SMS OTP  but opt for TOTP if choice is given.4. Don't click on any links or open any attachments that you THINK is safe. Only open if you KNOW is safe.",btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn 👍👍 for explaining the Cyber Hygiene tips. The choice of  tools is essential. To achieve security benefits  the people who use the tools need to use them properly. Otherwise  it is as good as not using them or may be even worse than not having the tools :),btohqsg

Thanks for sharing. I would keep mine brief mindful that this topic seems to be different from this channel. I have a similar experience that my Frank card was used abroad for buying Europe train tixs.Long story short  the more we use our card the higher likelihood of fraudulent transactions because of the increased exposure. We can only do what we can.Tips shared by Melvyn are super useful. I practise them myself but we all make mistakes as human. All it takes is a threat actor to compromise from the weakest link.As self-care  our 'respond and recovery' when fraudulent transactions are detected by us or informed by us by FIs help us not to panic  stay cool and leveled as we deal with the aftermath.,btohqsg

theoretically yes  but the UOB Evol window is quite tight.Min spend $600  cap at $20 for contactless which is effectively $250 spend @ 8%.I assume your regular monthly spend probably already hits that since you are using that card.So if you use up the cashback cap on your trip  your regular contactless spend in SG on that month can't enjoy this cashback.Probably better off using youtrip/trust/etc.Lastly  remember that UOB Evol has a '8%' cashback  effectively its lower because OPTIMALLY  you spend exactly $600.With at least $250 in online and contactless respectively.That gives you $40.3 cashback with $600 spend  effectively ~6.717% cashback which drops the more you spend past it.,btohqsg
sorry to add context is also because I'll be away from sg for almost a year  and if I can't hit the min. spend then I guess I need to forgot the UOB account as well... hahaha,btohqsg
maybe any other savings account recommended?,btohqsg
Assuming you want no risk no frills HYSA maybe  like HSBC EGA. tho might need to SMS every 4 months to activate promo rates assuming it continues.Or t-bills/fixed deposit etc if you don't need to touch and don't want to bother with it.,btohqsg

4 mpd on foreign currency. If you use Amaze  it will be charged local currency. Also suggest you to read full TnC.,btohqsg
Take note of the minimum spend. I think it’s something like $3000 or $5000.,btohqsg
That's the reason I suggested him to read TnC. People rarely read full TnC 😂,btohqsg
For credit card  nope because the HDB transaction is classified as a Govt Service (MCC 9399). You might be able to use Giro and get 'rewards'. U can read through the messages in this channel.,btohqsg
Alright thanks ! It’s a waste that hdb doesn’t have Amex payment 😂,btohqsg

Yes :) that's considered an online transaction. Note you can only earn up to $20 for the 5% online transaction CB category.,btohqsg

Hi all; i have money in Tiger Vault  anyone know how can i withdraw out into my bank a/c?,btohqsg
CSPX does not pay dividends to begin with. It is a Accumulating ETF :),btohqsg
Your funds in Tiger Vault is invested with a MMF fund manager as units. U need to sell your units. U need to wait (a few trading days? ) for the sales proceed of the units to be available for withdrawal.If u enable 'auto invest'  things would  get a little 'interesting'. U need to find out what timedailyTiger would sweep your S$/US$ to the MMFs and raise the withdrawal request before the time. This is to ensure your monies would not get back to the Vault to BUY MMF units.,btohqsg
Sorry im getting confused. Meaning I have to click on redeem first to sell?,btohqsg
If all your cash has been invested into the MMF as units  u need to redeem to sell your units to get back S$/US$.,btohqsg
Mindful that (I suppose) this is not an investment channel  this a good article for background reading.https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/distributing-or-accumulating-etfs-how-to-handle-investment-income.html,btohqsg
From increase in nav of ur fund. Basically the fund manager will use the dividend (after div withholding tax) and buy more share of the underlying fund. The number of cspx share u hold wont increase  but the unit price of the share will. Thats y if u compare cspx vs other distributing etf like spy  cspx price move up more.,btohqsg
This is a theoretical explanation taking out market forces. With market forces  CSPX unit price would fluctuate like any other Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on the stock exchange.,btohqsg
Folks  please feel free to correct me if this is inaccurate :),btohqsg
sure  there are issues with tracking error and of cos day to day fluctuation  but the difference is very obvious over time (blue line is cspx),btohqsg
I did a capstone project on CSPX vs S&P500 index for a 10 year period up till April 2022. Data says it all. Always choose accumulating ETF or Unit Trust for your long-term investment. It is always more efficient as compared to distributing ETF or Unit Trust options. The compounding effect is always powerful.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing with the folks here. I agree with u. Unfortunately  limited MAS licensed low cost Brokers support London Stock Exchange (LSE).I guess the closest on these platforms is VOO but is still a distributing ETF 😂.This is another background well written reading article for folks for ETF.https://seedly.sg/opinions/the-best-s-p-500-etf-for-singaporeans/,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there a credit card that I can use to make recurring annual insurance premiums payment and also provide 12 mths interest free installment payments? Thanks,btohqsg

I did a 'swap'. 'Swap' SBJul22 for SBMay23. Simple process. You need  funds on hand because you need funds to buy the SBMay23 first.If no fund  then got to spread across two SSB series.,btohqsg

Cashflo card avoid GE products you'll charge additional 1%,btohqsg
If a subscriber have hit the 200k ceiling  I think he needs to complete the redemption before subscribing.,btohqsg

Cannot. It’s meant to be used physically,btohqsg
I have successfully added to Google pay and used it before the physical card arrived.,btohqsg

Thanks Bro. But what about LiquidPay  do I need to download the apps also for LiquidPay? Or can use XNAP to pay the stall with LiquidPay accepted? TIA 😊,btohqsg
Welcome  Kelvin. Sorry I can't provide a direct ans to your question. If I see the 'multiple lines of logos' SGQR  I would use my XNAP app to scan. So far it works for me :),btohqsg
It’s okay. I downloaded the 2 Apps 😊,btohqsg
In what cases will posted and transaction date differ?,btohqsg
In all cases it would differ :). Transaction date and posted day differ typically differ between 1 - 3 days. Personally  I take the median (2 days).,btohqsg
So if I make a transaction today  the transaction will be posted in May? Will the e-statement reflect 30 April or May?,btohqsg
"Hi all  like to check if anyone knows for DBS WWMC "". The additional 9X DBS Pointsor 7X DBS Points are only applicable for the first S$2 000 online spend per calendar month"". If my bill is from 16th of the current month to 15th of May  then my $2000 will only reset on 16th May? =(EDIT: Called DBS to verify. They said 1st of the month to end of the month. It doesn't follow statement date.",btohqsg
It will reflect transaction date in Apr  posting date in May. The key point is that hsbc revolution rewards go by calendar month of posted transaction  so will apply for May.,btohqsg
Okay thanks everyone for clarifying 🙏,btohqsg
Agree. Now is 6.10 pm. Tomorrow is public holiday. Most likely the posting date would be 2nd May.,btohqsg
Your answer was in your question: calendar month 😁,btohqsg
Am new  have a few silly questions to ask.1. Does UOB One's interest rate compound monthly?2. If I have $30 000 in my UOB One account and only qualify for the first interest bracket  will I receive the next bracket's interest rate for the amount past $30 000 next month?3. How does the 7.65% interest rate for the $25 000 past $75 000 apply to UOB One's maximum 5% per annum interest rate for $100 000?Cause from the website’s calculator  it seems like the max we can get is the fixed $5000 per annum and 0.05% on remaining.Also just curious if this form of calculation is similar for other savings accounts. (The way per annum works  to me seems like simple interest per year divided by 12 months),btohqsg
Hi all have a question about DBS WWMC linked to Krispay transaction.Does anyone know if DBS WWMC used to make Krispay payments is counted as “online payments” and under the 4 mod earn rate?,btohqsg

Hi All  What do you think is the best credit card to buy an expensive air ticket priced at 1.4k  *while maximising rewards/cashback,btohqsg
Hi  think you have to add some background to your question such as what platform are you buying (e.g. Expedia  Chan Brothers office  Airline website) =),btohqsg
I will either go with Expedia or Qatar Airways,btohqsg
Which date did u received it? I have yet to receive it till date,btohqsg
Revolut promo requires u have transport spend in many days of the month.Problem is if u use MasterCard version it lumps a few days into 1. Causes problems.U need to use visa if u want spend posted daily.,btohqsg
For cashback  use either uob one or scb Manhattan for the proposed $1.4K spend size.,btohqsg
That could explain. I only had 9 transactions for the month T.T,btohqsg
Usually holidays or sundays some apps will conduct maintenance. Best not to keep trying if first time already kenna error.,btohqsg
Personally  I would use HSBC Revolution Credit Card to get 2.5% cashback unless Expedia and Qatar Airways give promo for specific cards.,btohqsg
HSBC rev is capped at $1000/month for the 4Mile/$ mean i will miss out  on the remaining $400,btohqsg
You need to do comparison between few websites n consider what credit card you have.UOB lady can get 6mpd up to $1k if you are on right category). Max $1k.DBS Altitude(8 mpd thru Expedia special link  it may be more expensive  pls compare)DBS altitude 3mpd max $5kHSBC 4mpd up to max $1k onlyDBS WWMC 4mpd up to $2k.,btohqsg
If you have SC credit cards  check SC website if the promotion up to 10% for Qatar airways worth or not compare to other credit card rewards.https://www.sc.com/sg/promotions/the-good-life-privileges/#731500-sg,btohqsg
Citibank also has up to 10% discount but promo ends today at 1159pm.https://www.citiworldprivileges.com/sg-singapore/online/up_to_10_off-341082,btohqsg
Anyone used DBS balance transfer feature? They're running a promo currently and I'm considering using it for my reno. From what I understand:DBS Green Renovation Loan$30000 loaned amountInsurance and handling fee are 1% each  taken from disbursed funds  $29400 paid to ID Firm.Monthly installment: $2 563.83  so $30 765.96 paid for $29400Total $1 365.96 paid in fees+ interest (30765.96-29400)DBS Balance TransferUse $29400 loan amount to compare4.5% fee = $1323  added to 'total amount loaned' for calculation of monthly repaymentsInterest freeMonthly installment for first 11 months: $768.075 (2.5% monthly payments using cashline)Last month: $22 274.175So main difference is if I choose DBS Balance Transfer Much better cashflow for first 11 months but no insurance on the loanAny opinions on this?,btohqsg

You can call DBS to tell them to see if they can change to Visa.I didn't put in the promo code  then after that  they honoured the promo code for the extra miles.,btohqsg
Can always apply for the visa one as well  no worries one. I currently have both visa and amex versions,btohqsg

Uob dont do by calender month,btohqsg
I hold almost all their card. It is always by statement. But if cso told u that then u follow loh,btohqsg
Online transactions wont affect. But for transportation tapping depends if your card can earn any rewards/cashback from tapping the physical card. Eg UOB ONE can but UOB evol doesnt.Another benefit about supp card is you and your mum will be able to keep track of the transactions of the supp card on the bank’s app  so its easier to differentiate which are her spendings and which is yours if you need to.,btohqsg
