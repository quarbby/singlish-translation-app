i have one parent ask me to insisit to teach their child even though the kid clearly dont want to learn,btohqsg
But most either they hire a shit one,btohqsg
and not gouging ppl of their life savings,btohqsg
Or one that has good marekting,btohqsg
to me is i dont mind shitty students but if u got attitude problems den big no no,btohqsg
because most tuition teachers aren't that great,btohqsg
I remember my tuition teacher who sold MLM products during class,btohqsg
dun expect As from your kids if u paying $20/hr to the teacher,btohqsg
Parents will never care about the value tuitionâ€¦all they know is sending their kids to tuition makes them feel accomplishedâ€¦they donâ€™t care about how the kids feel at all,btohqsg
but yeah if its $100/hr better be something good lol,btohqsg
The awm fa leader used to be a tutor(he made alot of tuition also),btohqsg
tbh im sure ppl charge $100 and we don't hear about it because they deliver results,btohqsg
Most parents never cared and never will because everything about their child is irrevelant to them except their status in the world,btohqsg
like full time tutor or ex moe teachers can go up to there i guess,btohqsg
He made alot of sexual joke  in the class and sell ILP and retirement plan to the parents,btohqsg
He used tuition to recruit people for fa business,btohqsg
but they must be good ones la,btohqsg
Like alot of his agents from his tuition,btohqsg
for the first time today im entertained,btohqsg
@juicecogenscan you make Waiter! Waiter! Another yappacino please! Into a sticker,btohqsg
He flex fa earn alot more and brainwash the kids since olevel to join his FA agemcy,btohqsg
Hi guys Iâ€™m not sure if freshies are suppose to post intros as well but I decided to step out of my comfort zone this camp. Anyways hi everybody my name is john  and this is my favourite character  Kanna of my favourite anime  Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon. Sorry I donâ€™t have any pictures of myself as Iâ€™m really shy. Iâ€™m studying computer science. I also love programming  did u know u can create anime girls using artificial intelligence?(happy to have chose computing)Oh and one fun fact is that i was in boys school for 10 years so I am really shy when it comes to girls. It just seems as though I canâ€™t piece proper words when it comes to the other genderâ€¦.. so if u see me during the camp please donâ€™t be scared to say hi to me! Excited to meet everyone ðŸ¤— P.S not to be creepy or anything but I love young anime girls!!,btohqsg
but could totally imagine some ppl writing this,btohqsg
Who tf is future of kurt,btohqsg
a rip off of future of ryan?,btohqsg
Guys rn my dp is ganyu right,btohqsg
still can't wait to grad but,btohqsg
yea but doesnâ€™t matter whether iâ€™m bachelors or phd,btohqsg
i can see this being legit,btohqsg
idt phd means can teach better than a bachelors ngl,btohqsg
what iâ€™m offered for what iâ€™d do is not worth,btohqsg
Kurt is Kurt  nothing else has to be said.,btohqsg
which is why im fully prepared to be friendless in uni,btohqsg
profs teach a lot better in my experience with higher level mods (or those closer to their specific field),btohqsg
i mean atp idrc about making close friends anymore,btohqsg
i realise my 3k mods' profs are all better than the 1k mods,btohqsg
i get along well enough with ppl to not get into any conflicts which is enough alr,btohqsg
is it because they can speak in their language and dont need to dumb down their understanding to our lvl,btohqsg
imagine u have decades of experience in say marketing,btohqsg
and u have to teach some kids wtf is the 5 Ps of marketing,btohqsg
4 Ps is the most impt,btohqsg
Ngl imagine if I make it to a uni ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yâ€™all gonna say rp system is rigged to the max,btohqsg
less of a gap and they can just assume you know certain things alr,btohqsg
my phd level classes were the best bc the students also v passionate,btohqsg
in a sense abit like branding i guess?,btohqsg
how u want your employees to be perceived by your customers,btohqsg
like how uniqlo employees alw say welcome to uniqlo!,btohqsg
or like luxury brand employees they alw wear suit n tie,btohqsg
Like expensive shoe stores wearing suit and tie and polishing shoes,btohqsg
