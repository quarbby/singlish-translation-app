Anyone knows the confirmed date for MT Quater results?,btohqsg
Oh crap. Genie left the group? Then who did I post the kkj rocket to? ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Apologies to the other genie in this groupðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ,btohqsg
I mean he left the other group,btohqsg
Btw does MT will be same as TG after releasing result?,btohqsg
MT : I think the key takeaway as follows1. Q3 Net profit expectedly higher than Q2  so no unpleasant surprise.2. Coy indicates record revenue n profit in the Q4  so the amazing story will continue at least for the following Q. In fact  the USD60 million UK contract may indicate a good surprise going forward. Note Q2 and Q3 revenue is the region of 120 to 126 million. That's almost half already  excluding their usual sales channels.2. Long term orders.. I would take it at least the next 6 months... So meaning the next 2 quarters still got story to tell...,btohqsg
