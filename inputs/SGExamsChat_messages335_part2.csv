You’ll just need to fulfil the min MTL requirements and get <21 L1R5 to advance to JC unconditionally,btohqsg
So if you really cannot pass O level Chi  I’d suggest that you take both CLB and O levels,btohqsg

With 20 pts u can go YIJC mah,btohqsg

I read the conditional admission stuff  basically if I'm not wrong at J1 u need take again then if u still cannot pass then you're kicked out?,btohqsg

Hii  can anyone send me the recent O Level May/June paper (in pdf)? Want to take it look.,btohqsg
i was tryna find out if i can clear my absence with valid reason in honest ways,btohqsg
but since np doesnt allow parent letters,btohqsg

im too used to open book,btohqsg

plus if u actually study u do better than others,btohqsg
i feel terrible when i study but fail,btohqsg
if i dont study at least i can understand partly why i fail,btohqsg
if u never study u wont know if u can fail,btohqsg
u wont know if u can pass as well,btohqsg
YEAH! I have no excuses on why I failed - I put in the effort and I still flopped.,btohqsg
Don't blame others for your own failure,btohqsg
You are the reason of your own downfall,btohqsg
