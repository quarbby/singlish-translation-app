üòÆ A Ferrari driver was arrested on drug-related charges after a car accident in the Beach Road area.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3a36OuSFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
yah i read this also ü§£,btohqsg
i normally autostop then i stop alr,btohqsg
i first few times i pump to the max. after i read this i scared,btohqsg
auto stop i squeeze a bit more i stop liao lol but i see my friend like no fk given every time pump until want flow out,btohqsg
say can squeeze almost 10L extra,btohqsg
Auto stop 2 times OK alr,btohqsg
Then round off nearest dollar or cents,btohqsg
yah i normally try to round off nicr nice cuz i don‚Äôt like to keep coins,btohqsg
The theory is same as our stomach,btohqsg
plus no need go Q up ‚Äòdeposit‚Äô cash,btohqsg
Over fill  they say the petrol goes into the charcoal canister or something,btohqsg
Jb is it  need to deposit the card,btohqsg
"Some of my friends register for the ""youtrip""card",btohqsg
i stay yishun. go jb not say very far so i go in pump lor. plus supper,btohqsg
It's like a debit card for overseas use,btohqsg
but maybe need to stop. the other day step on weighing scale had a shock,btohqsg
So just top up sgd into the card via the app then pay using that,btohqsg
thanks bro i go explore later,btohqsg
I have but I don't use it  just straight go to cc  cuz mine is a travel card,btohqsg
No wonder why@ishengjiecome out like that... Yishun boy,btohqsg
I can say coz I also yishun,btohqsg
yishun have power car wash ü§™,btohqsg
wa i think here a lot bros n sis stay yishun one,btohqsg
Wa... Here alot of yishunites. Me included,btohqsg
Been a few years of legacy,btohqsg
Leg heavy on Malaysia highway = good mileage,btohqsg
U will see ur oil gauge very active,btohqsg
For you makes sense to go in,btohqsg
Yishun at least 17 to 20,btohqsg
I from petron  to custom already 6km,btohqsg
Should check the spark plugs see if it affects,btohqsg
Mine used to have lots of the rumble sound and some other issues. The spark plug look almost like it's rusty,btohqsg
After all settled  that same rusty spark plugs went back to normal,btohqsg
I want change my stock spark plugs to the iridium one,btohqsg
It was the kind workshop see also asking why like that,btohqsg
*Attention*SCD will have our own internal team to work on rescuing abandoned animals & pets  rehoming them after nursing them back to health.We are working towards being a car enthusiasm group with a good cause.Why animals?There are many groups & temple doing food donation drive weekly. Animals aren't able to voice out their pain & suffering.All kinds of help are greatly appreciated. Donations / volunteers / spreading awareness.Channel for news and update:https://t.me/scdanimalrescueLINKED Private Chat for discussion:https://t.me/+2WBvBCx-3yA2ZmI1,btohqsg
Is it good to change to the iridium one?,btohqsg
It would drop to 12 on acceleration. Then the car would have hesitation feeling,btohqsg
Main issue was my leaky exhaust and my iacv,btohqsg
Tps sensor calibration was also off,btohqsg
Drop in spoon ecu  basically a flashed ECU from spoon,btohqsg
Some ppl feel after tune save fuel,btohqsg
Yeah thought about it  but 2k plus just to do the ECU,btohqsg
For now it's running quite alright,btohqsg
Ya if Not why they spend million to r&d,btohqsg
Fc could be better but I can live with this,btohqsg
If ur engine is 95 tuned and u pump higher it doesnt mean better. Sometimes your ECU has to compensate if your engine temp or compression is not tuned for that ron. This will affect your FC,btohqsg
My car is ron 96. Between 95 and 97 i measure same fc so far.,btohqsg
The spoon ecu I doubt is tuned for 95... Previously on stock ecu  the car would feel like it lacked power when using 95,btohqsg
Also the ron100 I do feel like it's more responsive,btohqsg
you should be pumping nothing less than 98 haha,btohqsg
unless your tune has been adjusted for lower octane rating,btohqsg
Been using 98 or 100. The amount of times I pump 95 can count with 1 hand,btohqsg
great. no more 95/ 97 for you,btohqsg
The 97 I've yet to try,btohqsg
I think your worse fc may be due to: ‚Äúnow petrol cheap i can ENJOY MY VTEC‚Äù,btohqsg
Jb so far either petron100 or vpower racing,btohqsg
even for swift sport need minimum 98. specified on the fuel door,btohqsg
Never drove a swift sport before,btohqsg
The vtec I don't open so often la,btohqsg
yes should be high comp. 2.0NA but 200bhp.,btohqsg
Min 95 can but fun keep loot,btohqsg
No knocking sound should be ok,btohqsg
The low rpm sound quite nice,btohqsg
Bearing in mind ecu compensates to prevent literal knocking but this is already compromising performance,btohqsg
Whoever tuned the engine would be best to advise,btohqsg
My ecu can't be tuned.... Unless I install like a hondata,btohqsg
Then easy case  refer to manufacturers recommendations,btohqsg
Sometimes in the owner manual  sometimes on the petrol cap door,btohqsg
Some more after you upgrade  you get used to it then don't feel it anymore,btohqsg
Like when I went from stock to spoon  I could feel a difference. But now I don't remember what difference it was,btohqsg
Sg how fast we can go,btohqsg
Is not how fast  is how shiok the car makes you feel,btohqsg
Maybe I not into all this already haha,btohqsg
That means u are tired of it already,btohqsg
Need to one day own another car,btohqsg
buyers are making it possible too haha,btohqsg
Woah. You mean fd2r was 7k depre previously ? Holy. Im new to the car scene and looking at the pricing of 7k vs at least 18k for fd2r now. Woah.,btohqsg
jing tian de gui  shi ming tian de pian yi,btohqsg
I was still looking around at fn and fd. lol. Thinking about how long i need to save up to change to a fd. lol. But now then you mentioned it was 7k...,btohqsg
I totally didnt know it was 7k,btohqsg
When i bought my fit last year  it was at 7.8k depre. I already felt reasonable. My friend even said 7.8k depre still quite high. Now i look at the second hand market. Fit going on for 10k depre. dafug.,btohqsg
Come guys COE was not 104k previously,btohqsg
Its not hype its market forces,btohqsg
Altis is 140k new  its not hype,btohqsg
Same... The euro r I got at 10.8,btohqsg
But you sell  nothing to buy... All went higher,btohqsg
I won't say names of dealers,btohqsg
maybe some of you alr know,btohqsg
"Got a few dealers ""borrowed"" friend's cars",btohqsg
Nvm la they raise my car I don't mind,btohqsg
then list at higher depre price not intending to sell,btohqsg
How I know? My friend's evo 9 was borrowed,btohqsg
i saw the listing  i go shoot him asking i tot you say this kind of car wont sell? why is this dealer listing your car for sale?,btohqsg
Then he said they borrow to drive prices up,btohqsg
Puts a smile on your face? Priceless,btohqsg
Really heng. Kena poisoned at the right time. If I don‚Äôt buy back then  I think I will be carless now and till don‚Äôt know when,btohqsg
Mastercard cnt help me pay my debt üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But they can let you be in debt,btohqsg
"but you still ""paid"" your dept",btohqsg
Sorry still young to understand any of thisü§≠,btohqsg
Even if your car is 7/10 or 3/10 years left  when coe rockets and average depre increases your car value also increases. This really doesnt need me to justify ba.,btohqsg
Though you can say for rare models  there is some bubble supply and demand that runs separately,btohqsg
For example fd3s absolutely is doing its own crazy shit in the corner,btohqsg
Im pretending it doesnt exist now,btohqsg
Cars like S2K  Evos Type Rs,btohqsg
When u buy  just rmb when can you pay off your loan.,btohqsg
If the day where prices drop  and you lost your job,btohqsg
Im waiting for rx8 population to decrease more. Its happening faster than i thought sia,btohqsg
U sell your car cant even cover your loan,btohqsg
Depre has been 10k average for a while,btohqsg
Still a lot of market. Need more to be sold off and scrap üòõ,btohqsg
If I get  Rx8 I go daily drive  dowan drive in msia,btohqsg
Cb later half way b4 yong peng breakdown,btohqsg
I genting also up liao. Rx8 is not a scary car if u look after it properly,btohqsg
1.4 rocs are still below 10k renewed ones,btohqsg
This car stuck 1 year alr,btohqsg
but his price also stuck 10k depre,btohqsg
I shortlisted that car  but wasnt that keen as swif sport is as good as that,btohqsg
didnt regret getting mine as first car,btohqsg
my first car was a EG9,btohqsg
haylee read that she damp alr,btohqsg
EG to DC5 to WRX to Audi,btohqsg
LIFE WAS GOOD FOR U MAN,btohqsg
honda boy but the prices cannot tahan‚Ä¶ so take swift sport,btohqsg
hahaha okie layou also can de,btohqsg
eg and dc5 are all fun,btohqsg
really nice to drive and handle,btohqsg
So all the JDMs to Audi,btohqsg
really really fun to drive and the turbo boost was sick,btohqsg
I scrap my swift at 330k,btohqsg
Damn i'd love to own a wrx too,btohqsg
But if you can choose again  WRX or Audi?,btohqsg
Wrx I love the older generation,btohqsg
Not a big fan of the newer gen,btohqsg
hard to choose broMaybe more towards audi as the FC and comfort is so much better,btohqsg
but the newer ones have smarter electronics,btohqsg
Over the years all the jdm I tested n driven before,btohqsg
Is still one of the best,btohqsg
my FC for wrx was ard 7 - 7.6 km/l,btohqsg
Because they are the last Na build,btohqsg
I haven't had the chance to try the fk,btohqsg
So I can't give my thoughts on it,btohqsg
But stock fd2r suspension is a  killer,btohqsg
Esp when one wind down window n travel along tunnel,btohqsg
i miss the swift's VVT kick,btohqsg
i can definitely tell VTEC kick cfm more fun,btohqsg
if i'm already having so much fun from VVT,btohqsg
I mz3 to mz3 to rx8 guess my favorite brand,btohqsg
and i love how both of them still independant,btohqsg
I just wished rotaries got the development budget that could have made them more efficient or even hybridize,btohqsg
Would be so sad if it disappears,btohqsg
They kept saying about wanting to make the rotary a range extender or some sort,btohqsg
That one cant really count ba,btohqsg
My first car was a 3 tonner then Land Rover.,btohqsg
Drive two year I didn‚Äôt drive alr,btohqsg
If u want to count like that‚Ä¶ light strike vehicle then RHIB,btohqsg
Land Rover still a car Ma,btohqsg
I have never wished for anything so hard as the vision coupe or rx9,btohqsg
but new miata might be a hybrid or EV,btohqsg
sometimes i wished i was a little older  maybe i would have owned a WRX or STI,btohqsg
but I'm also glad that I have my miat,btohqsg
Maybe i wont want also la,btohqsg
i'd rather be seen rolling in a cherry QQ,btohqsg
MX5 reminds me of a frog,btohqsg
How does it even work sia,btohqsg
Toyota they trying to program the motor to behave like a petrol car,btohqsg
so instead of step all the way you get instant torque,btohqsg
They regulate the torque based on how a normal engine would,btohqsg
to simulate how a petrol car works,btohqsg
But TL:DR edition: Toyota limiting the power of an EV just to make it drive like a petrol car,btohqsg
it honestly sounds something like throttle controller or some sort,btohqsg
It's just ECU tuning only i assume,btohqsg
But cannot compare w@SolahxKikoula he professional,btohqsg
I try come at 10? But I new and shy,btohqsg
Chair  snacks  drinks all is bring yourself,btohqsg
no need shy..we all friendly and easy going,btohqsg
