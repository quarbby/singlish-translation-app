Then u have to keep in EGA,btohqsg
So they take into account of daily balance? The rates I gotten in ocbc 360 is higher than the HSBC EGA LoL,btohqsg
5%+ you will need 2 accounts as you need to move the funds from HSBC A > Outside Account > HSBC B every month.,btohqsg
the 4.x% is based on average daily balance on top of the Reference Month.,btohqsg
Needed 2 acc? I thought fresh fund into newly created EGA will be suffic. Of cuz hitting 2k monthly n 5 transactions,btohqsg
As Chris said  the $2k and 5 transactions is just for HSBC EGA Rewards (which is the 1%s),btohqsg
the 4.x% is your incremental ADB over the reference month ADB.,btohqsg
Ohhh understood. And this only last for 3months?,btohqsg
regardless  both the 1%s and the 4.x% still needs you to keep the cash in HSBC. No bank will pay you interest for all days in the month if you just move the money in one day  then take out one day later.,btohqsg
The 4.x% lasts 4 months. For myself:My reference month is February 2023.I will be paid 4.x% p.a. interest for March April May June 2023.,btohqsg
Then July 2023 I will have to SMS in again to start a new 4 month cycle.Of course the above is the 'basic method' which assumes you only have one human.If you have 2 humans then u have to alternate musical chairs. But you can achieve 5.x% p.a. if you have 2 humans.,btohqsg
The 4.x% only pays out in July right?,btohqsg
for MY case  my fulfilment date is 31st August 2023.All such details can be found in the PDF file. Make sure you save a copy of your own promo.,btohqsg
dont forget HSBC EGA have a min $2k to be kept in the account otherwise you will need to pay a fall below fee,btohqsg
Oh same case. Thus in July I just send in sms again to renew the cycle? Tho I didn't receive such PDF. I ask the customer service directly. They stated august 2023 is my fulfilment date,btohqsg
if only ONE human  then you can't.. because if you SMS in July  your reference month is June (and you had money inside).You have to cooldown one month and keep HSBC EGA empty ($2k) in July and only SMS in August (reference month July),btohqsg
u download the PDF terms and conditions from hsbc website,btohqsg
So basically they need another person. U said can from 1 ega to another EGA(brand new acc). After my completion that is. I will then empty my that account to recycle it:),btohqsg
no i didn't say that..i said:HSBC A to outside to HSBC B.,btohqsg
OPPS  alright. Shall follow this method n get another human ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
make sure the 'outside' is ideally a joint account of A/B... otherwise you going to trigger AML checks and questions.,btohqsg
around $50 of you put in around 100k,btohqsg
Wydm by joint acc of A/B. My outside have a joint acc  e.g me and my dad. My dad doesn't have a HSBC acc. The way to recycle requires a joint acc outside and then xfer to the newly created EGA?,btohqsg
HSBC account is probably the most complicated account with the most steps and the worst is you only know the result 6 months later.. ALL OR NOTHING!but it is rewarding since pays up to 5.x% with no salary or spending requirements.,btohqsg
the logic is if you do big amounts from a stranger account into HSBC account  it will trigger checks.If HSBC (you) to joint account (you/father) to hsbc (father).. it is fine.If HSBC (you) to joint account (you/father) to hsbc (wife).. it is not fine.,btohqsg
yes it is haha  most of my money is parked in UOB One  HSBC is just extra bonus,btohqsg
got bank call me and I just reply according,btohqsg
that was because I keep moving money around,btohqsg
For the last statement  as long the funds isn't a very huge amt is fine right?,btohqsg
Not sure isit wise to all in..,btohqsg
I think it's the money movement  not the amount. they want to make sure no money laundering or money mules activity,btohqsg
definitely not wisethere's no clear confirmation abt whether u are doing correctly or no,btohqsg
well if the fund is not large  why do you want the HSBC EGA hassle?,btohqsg
But the rates is darn high tho haha n yeah.. my ocbc 360 getting rates monthly,btohqsg
It's better than ocbc360 with just crediting n save category,btohqsg
I max out ocbc 365 and UOB one  then HSBC.,btohqsg
before I try HSBC I was throwing into GXS and Mira / Trust,btohqsg
uob tricky bit is the $100k is sort of locked in like semi fixed deposit.,btohqsg
but now finally decided to try the more complicated HSBC hope all goes well,btohqsg
What happened if fulfilment is completed and I withdraw 100% sum?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is higher than HSBC (without 1% bonus)  right?,btohqsg
Just 3.25% with credit n save,btohqsg
uob one equivalent to 5% if 100k,btohqsg
Can I close it lol. No interest anyway,btohqsg
OCBC 360 -> Credit  save n spend is 4.65%  correct ?,btohqsg
Haha I dun spend that much.  Unless it's essential,btohqsg
advisable to always keep your unused accounts and cards.you never know when a new promo comes and by the time you rush to open/apply for it:1. u waste time and miss out the promo2. the product no longer being offered,btohqsg
you can utilise it again with 2000 as the baseline,btohqsg
How to clock the minimum spend of $500 for the $228 cashback from OCBC credit card sign up promotion? It seems like many exclusions. Can share some tips? Thanks! üôè,btohqsg
pay singtel bill? not sure excluded or not.,btohqsg
