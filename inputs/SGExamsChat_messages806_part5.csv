1 month I think is the limit for most tourist visas,btohqsg
U start to get into issues liao cuz u aren't supposed to stay so long,btohqsg
And for holiday exchange  only hv canada  germany  i cant rmb the other europe countries  and korea,btohqsg
Neh my Japan visa was 4m,btohqsg
As in some of them hv breaks in between but they seem to he travelling alot,btohqsg
4m is like really pushing it and idk what u are supposed to do for 4 months as a tourist.,btohqsg
And some ppl kena caned for being an overstayerðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Also to maintain tax residency in SG u gotta stay at least 1 month in SG per year,btohqsg
Also months where u get the money lmao tourist visa cannot work one,btohqsg
Isn't japan just a visa waiver? I think its 90 days for sg passport in japan; many countries give 15-90 days for singaporeans,btohqsg
Ok my 4ever is not really 4everâ€¦but just ya for long periods of time,btohqsg
May - Aug is still 3 months lol not 4,btohqsg
Idk why but my passport rote May - Aug (which is 4m),btohqsg
May 10 - Aug 10 for example would be 3 months,btohqsg
Wait ya it is 3m  my brain has not waken up,btohqsg
Gotta have a lot of capital basically also looks suspicious for immigration,btohqsg
I think US will deny entry if you stay for max number of days too often...,btohqsg
No like they are overseas for ard 1/2m to 1m (like either 1 trip or separate trips add up),btohqsg
Isn't that quite normal for dec holidays,btohqsg
My family holidays usually only 10-15d,btohqsg
Anybody knows a daily pay job?,btohqsg
But erm it is May-June nowðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I think Banquet jobs are daily pay too,btohqsg
Uh... some ppl visit family too which might take up entire jun hols,btohqsg
Gude why u thumbs down me,btohqsg
Then maybe they're just loaded haha,btohqsg
I thought holiday usually got alot of job eh,btohqsg
But that means they also hv a lot of cash (either parents sponsor or somehow they hv a lot of cash),btohqsg
Daily pay is usually this kind one,btohqsg
I hv a friend whose parents rich  buy him sq business class tickets (at least $10k),btohqsg
Or they play the mileage run game and get 2 holidays for the price of 1,btohqsg
Neh theirs is free n easy not on tour,btohqsg
You buy cheap business class tickets and accrue more miles than you actually spend money,btohqsg
Then use said miles to go for another holiday,btohqsg
The opposite ngl holiday will flood with Students looking for gigs,btohqsg
Most ppl do not use hacks coz it is not supposed to be the case,btohqsg
Idk about the market now but a yr or two ago it was 500/$80,btohqsg
Idk why he so obsessed with flying atas,btohqsg
These are not hacks  they are made under normal ticket fares which are simply available only thru diy,btohqsg
Meanwhile i heard that if i work in clinical  they will prioritise those w family to take leave in decðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But they are published in the gds for all to see,btohqsg
Go make a family lor ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Neh if im a doctor i think leave not a problem  doctor has infinite power,btohqsg
Because its better than flying economy for the same price,btohqsg
Im obsessed w flying ANA and SQ,btohqsg
And its fun to see people who paid more than you trudge their way back into economy,btohqsg
Meanwhile did u read the article about tokyo govt creating the date apps to increase birthrates,btohqsg
Funnily enough Tokyo doesn't need that,btohqsg
It doesn't work. Singapore's government gave up long ago when they tore down sdu,btohqsg
It's other parts of Japan that need to increase birth rates as the migration to Tokyo increases the population,btohqsg
