Hi!  just want to know  i booked a flat last year september. It‚Äôs been 6months & i haven‚Äôt been called to sign the lease agreement. isit normal üòÖ,btohqsg
Why deduct 100k? Deduct 50k only la,btohqsg
Point 3 yes as it is payable only to HDB,btohqsg
Normal. Just chill haha the later it is  the better,btohqsg
Tell me about it. Mine close to 8 months and counting. üòè,btohqsg
Isn't it a good thing? Hahaha,btohqsg
Yep kinda is haha.. can save more CPF funds .. üòÅ,btohqsg
And your CPF earn interest monthly. So it's a good thing haha,btohqsg
These are the housing grants available if you're going for resale flats.,btohqsg
Hi  I have a few questions regarding BTO and grant. I am currently still in school  however my partner has been working for a while. She recently had a job change and would allow her to be able to pay for the house fully. We are currently looking to book for the May bto.1. When can we apply for the bto grant  preferably before her pay raise so we can maximise the grant amount.2. Since her salary allow for us to cover for the installment. Would it be possible for us to apply as co-occupier instead or co applicant. Doing so to prevent stamp duty tax.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
1. You cant choose when you apply for it. The application will be done when you go for your selection of flat appointment - one of the sets of documents required will be (her) income documents from the 12 months preceding the launch. i.e. income documents from May 2022 to Apr 2023 will be used to determine the grant amount2. Yes  you can apply as main applicant and co-occupier if you wish. To do this  you need to indicate so in the application form.,btohqsg
Thanks a lot this was very helpful. I assume we can't use my part of the grant if I apply as co-occupier,btohqsg
Np! Actually i would think that the full grant amount would reside in the CPF of your partner since they are the main applicant. But Im not sure of how grant disbursement and usage applies for your situation. Might be best to clarify with HDB on this!,btohqsg
Thanks this is really helpful ! Hope u have a great weekend ahead,btohqsg
Any HDB officers in e house here??,btohqsg
Doubt so and doubt they will reveal themselves haha but do free to post your questions.,btohqsg
When will they start calling appointments for Feb 2023 ballot,btohqsg
Depends... Each project different due to size of the launch.,btohqsg
Hi  i have checked the OBF unit have been all taken  but yet to receive to update from HDB to inform us that no longer required us to go down yet. Does it mean still will stand a chance?,btohqsg
U should receive some sms like this informing u not to go down.,btohqsg
Yes. If you provided your email add,btohqsg
Fernvale vines supposed to top tis year jan. But till now some units not top. Going to compensate ma?,btohqsg
hello. my BTO will be ready by 4th quarter 2024. I also just received my Appointment to Sign Agreement for Lease email letter (next month).my question is  will this affect me if I have been laid off this month?or will it affect the key collection appointment (next year)  considering that there's a gap in my monthly CPF contributions?,btohqsg
Dont think it will affect.But if you need to re-do your HLE  then it may affect.,btohqsg
If your ehg and loan approved  shouldn't be a issue otherwise it depend on the period of unemployment also.,btohqsg
Lucky for me  my EHG was approved days before my layoff. But I haven‚Äôt had any appointments regarding my HDB loan yet. Will that be during the key collection appointment?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if I need to redo my HLE‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt gone for the HDB loan appointment yet. I guess I‚Äôll have the ready the HLE before that appointment?,btohqsg
I think u can do ur HLE now,btohqsg
Cos u still have ur current income,btohqsg
The moment HLE short of income  then u may have some problem alr,btohqsg
HLE should last u about 1 year,btohqsg
So if ur house is coming year end  they will depend on ur HLE.,btohqsg
understood. but if I do now  HLE should be valid until May 2024 (if it lasts for 1 year). my house won't be ready until 4th quarter 2024. when should I expect the HDB Loan Appointment to come? a few months before house is ready?,btohqsg
I'm afraid the HLE won't be valid if the appointment comes after May 2024,btohqsg
If we go by a normal process  this is gamble u may need to take,btohqsg
1. Apply HLE now. Pray that the validity can last you till 2024 Q4,btohqsg
2. Apply HLE now. Even if the validity cannot last you till 2024 Q4  there are cases where i heard even when the HLE expires  HDB still uses the old HLE.,btohqsg
Actually just apply now  it wont do u any harm,btohqsg
true that. I'll go apply today. thanks Seb!,btohqsg
Even if they want u to reapply  it will be 1-2 months before u get keys. Which by then is about end of 2024 Q3.,btohqsg
But I do see a lot of cases whereby HLE no need to reapply even though it expire.,btohqsg
Cos i am one of them,btohqsg
But i still reapply because i need a higher amount due to CPF investment,btohqsg
Thats why i say its a bit of a gamble,btohqsg
Cos i dono when they will change the rules,btohqsg
But fret not  i think it would be safe to just apply and see how it goes :),btohqsg
Just to note  HLE is not the final amount they will loan u.U can always appeal and get higher loan amount.,btohqsg
another scenario... let's say I get a new job in May  there will be a gap in CPF contributions for April. I was planning to fill that gap with cash-into-CPF  just so that there will be a continuous flow of CPF contributions without any gaps. it should be fine right?,btohqsg
My HLE was 300k  but i needed 400k.They ask me to resubmit  which is the same as what i did the first time  and they just give me 400k.I dono whats the diff tbh.,btohqsg
Dont have to fill that gap with cash,btohqsg
