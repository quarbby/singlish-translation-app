More involving and also good too. Need to spend time learning a little bit but not too difficult too. Carista is simpler and more user friendly. Depends on what you need it to do for you I guess?,btohqsg

wondering when is next facelift for Mazda 3  6 and CX-5 coming here? 🤔 overdue liao (especially CX-5),btohqsg
Mazda 6 and cx-5 really overdue  the 3 still has the new interior and everything,btohqsg
Mazda is discontinuing the cx-3 and 6 in some markets already so 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
is it Mazda will replace CX-50 to CX-5? similary to CX-30 to CX-3?,btohqsg
bit confusing product line CX-30 and CX-3,btohqsg
Super hot like oven. Can’t test. Unbearable weather,btohqsg
Cx-3 is the size of a Mazda 2 hatch but crossover. Cx-30 is the crossover of a Mazda 3 hatch,btohqsg
Maybe I travel next week I go rent a Mazda and play,btohqsg
U all said till so good   like I missing out all the fun,btohqsg
I’m back to Mazda 6. Best 👍,btohqsg
So many now driving Mazda. Popular again .,btohqsg
Don’t worry your engine oil temp is still warming up 😁😁 almost there now,btohqsg
Engine oil is already warmed up. External ambient temperature outside is extreme.,btohqsg
Can I borrow your Tesla? I promised I won’t floor it,btohqsg
Hi all any mk7.5 golf 1.4 owner here? Want to ask if it is normal for abit of acceleration lag? Test drove one over the weekend but like not very responsive until i step hard then will shoot forward and start accelerating,btohqsg
Tested the audi 1.0 also  thought would be less powerful but was surprisingly more responsive than the golf haha,btohqsg
haha maybe the turbo lag abit more evident then other cars  its a common issue for many cars around the world:),btohqsg
Next time la when I back after 14 days maybe can kopi,btohqsg
But thought audi and vw share same engine  should behave the same except audi maybe less power since 1.0? Haha,btohqsg
Then u can try floor and vtec kick in yoz,btohqsg
maybe the vw whack too much... all loose liao...,btohqsg
Not all the time  also the 1.0 is a newer engine compared to the 1.4. they reduced to turbo lag so you get the power earlier but the 1.4 can hold for longer,btohqsg
The 1.0 in the older a3 and new a1 is the same as a VW polo,btohqsg
1 liter engine road tax how much ar,btohqsg
Can even show off to Honda Fit on the lower road tax,btohqsg
@vseh1also  make sure to pop the car in sport mode or the gearbox into sport mode especially if it's a used car as the previous drivers may not be stepping hard so the TCU has learnt their patterns and has a slower kickdown. In sport  the gearbox will be more responsive.,btohqsg
I’ve never owned VW or Audi. But I test the A4 old models. Non turbo. I feel the engine is kinda coarse. Sounds rough like diesel.,btohqsg
They have come a long way in terms of refinement! Also for the older engines really depends on how they are maintained and cannot compare to newer engines,btohqsg
The EA888 3B is arguably one of the smoothest engines with great tuning potential if desired,btohqsg
I met a female driver of A4 who turned to Lexus is250 I think. She said the Audi A4 is crap!,btohqsg
Another one who owned the Audi A6 bought it new faced so many problems he eventually dumped I to get a Mercedes Benz E200.,btohqsg
Of course i do not know now. Because companies can improve products,btohqsg
But many bad tales from owners who owned Audis,btohqsg
