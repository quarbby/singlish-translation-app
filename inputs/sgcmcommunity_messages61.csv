Video Review - Audi SQ7 4.0 TFSI qu Tip 7-Seater (A)With 500bp and seats for seven  the Audi SQ7 is one hunk of a machine to ferry your family around in.👉🏻 React with 😁 if you love the hunky Audi SQ7!👉🏻 React with 🤔 if you prefer other hunky SUVs! (Eg. BMW X5M  Mercedes-AMG GLE-Class)➡️Watch ithere!,btohqsg
Babe I know no Porsche and above no talk,btohqsg
u can go taobao buy lambo Ferrari key😂😂,btohqsg
I am just a average working guy,btohqsg
Hahaha not the 640i tho. But this unit looks nice,btohqsg
There was the c63 dr520 a while backhttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1068937,btohqsg
Ya definitely  shall changes by look so different,btohqsg
The car's rep has been tarnished,btohqsg
C180K actually nice without the fake quad exhaust,btohqsg
if want w204 c180 go cgi,btohqsg
Actually i think wider the the e series m3,btohqsg
Never driven the kompressor models  infact never driven anything with a supercharger. Dont know what it feels like,btohqsg
my family owned the w211 twice  very reliable and smooth actually,btohqsg
pity the c200s ruined the kompressor image  other wise it was a great car,btohqsg
Mercs tend to be quite light off the line. But lacks grunt. Of cos not including the amg models,btohqsg
for sure lacked grunt  181hp to rear wheels i think,btohqsg
the second one had coils and rims 🙈,btohqsg
that’s it  no performance mods for ahpehcar,btohqsg
but that one legit car for ahpeh one HAHAHA kinda dig it tho,btohqsg
Merc image is changing of late. Thanks to introduction of the a class and the 43s,btohqsg
Not sure if for the better or for worse,btohqsg
I feel zhnged merc looks more riced out than bmws,btohqsg
i actually prefer the 45s to 43s,btohqsg
there is no limit to how riced your car can look,btohqsg
and for sure haha  seldom u see modded e class but always see modded f10s 🌚,btohqsg
The w212 was a massive upgrade. Looks way sharper and still pretty modern now,btohqsg
F10 without pops and bangs is like pasta with no cheese,btohqsg
43s are likes the 35s  like a sub brand. More affordable means more boy racers i guess haha,btohqsg
f10 with pops and bangs is like wearing a tuxedo without pants,btohqsg
m5 is spared of course but cannot be the obnoxious machine gun artificial sound kind haha,btohqsg
BUT a civic without a wing is like pasta without cheese,btohqsg
eh did u remove ur wing,btohqsg
i saw a nice FD on my recommended,btohqsg
HAHA it didn’t make sense ah that wing,btohqsg
Not mine in case anyone gets the wrong idea hahaha,btohqsg
eh some bmw also fking bad,btohqsg
Countless. Its a sportier car and ride. And i think cheaper too,btohqsg
My fav quote of the day-R,btohqsg
He deserves the car mat tbh,btohqsg
but ah the AMG w213s look really good,btohqsg
my car alw in ws no need la i need oil pan not car mat,btohqsg
Lbwk feels hahahaha. And also had the glass see through bonnet,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminif we win  can we sell it,btohqsg
Ya i dont deny. But feels like different level of bad compared to mercs hahaha,btohqsg
okay la all brands got damn riced one,btohqsg
bmw for sure the more sporty brand,btohqsg
my mercedes forever in my heart hehe,btohqsg
i do love the w203 amg line,btohqsg
Has been in the market for so long,btohqsg
dosent this guy have a c200 also in ironman spec,btohqsg
WAIT i remembered the seats was different coolor,btohqsg
I remember seeing the orange one,btohqsg
But this one got legit brabus parts leh,btohqsg
this one is like bordering rice,btohqsg
My gripe is when they put the badge,btohqsg
THE C70 NO WAY BACK BRO,btohqsg
uhhh is this shaming or is this judging?,btohqsg
they do this kind of FLASHY design to let ppl see and judge,btohqsg
Also I just want to say do whatever you want to your car,btohqsg
We laugh nvm  you happy can liao,btohqsg
Haha not shaming  collecting public opnion haha,btohqsg
Okay la  pls continue ur discussion🤗,btohqsg
I  too  get comments for my wingless civic 🤪,btohqsg
From 90% of the people I met,btohqsg
Is RR really worth the money,btohqsg
Take away RR from the market,btohqsg
The most expensive car on SGCM is a hybrid car,btohqsg
My carpark has a few owners with  lets just say  questionable taste. 640i -> 650i  523i -> m5   e250 -> e63 amg with presumably maxhaust.,btohqsg
The looks on people's faces when u tell them u drive a hybrid...,btohqsg
How about wingless GTR? What do you think of it?🤔-R,btohqsg
Would love to see a sf90 parked in a hybrid lot and getting stomped,btohqsg
I always park at hybrid lot but no 1 stomp me,btohqsg
Ya before ev was cool haha,btohqsg
"I toyed with the idea of getting the activehybrid 5/3 to get such ""priority"" lots hahah",btohqsg
Slap on a full catless exhaust,btohqsg
Hahaha not sure if a good thing or not,btohqsg
Try parking family lot  higher chance haha,btohqsg
Did I win? Or did I 陪跑only? (Pacer) lol,btohqsg

Normal leh.You go Malaysia. Toyota Vios scissor door 😂👍,btohqsg
Last time Honda City also have scissor door. In Singapore.RIP 🙏,btohqsg
Their cars. They do what they one. Who are we to judge Lol.It's like body shaming 😔It's like saying fat or ugly ppl cannot go salon do hair treatment/ Korean perm?,btohqsg
okay la i think its fine,btohqsg
but it makes things damn inconvenient,btohqsg
the mechanism is to open the door horizontally  then the door go up vertically,btohqsg
Spend money mods carCreate job and helps economy if not life boring ma.Then they spend money on drugs worst 😱,btohqsg
okay time to zhng car again😋😋,btohqsg
only?🙄🙄 must straight pipe  underglow  99% tint,btohqsg
99% tint is outdated should use clear film then inside install led lights,btohqsg
That can change colour like disco,btohqsg
Drive such car always got chick beside you,btohqsg
Need clear film to show off   why tint so dark can’t show off at all,btohqsg
precisely got chick then must 99 % tint ma.. u dunno meh,btohqsg
u want show off wat u n yr chick do inside the car😂😂,btohqsg
Pretty chick is to show off,btohqsg
U wear expensive watch and branded clothes with chick with you in car is to show off ma   u tint so dark for what might as well wear like a coolie,btohqsg
take bus mrt best can show off to the whole bus n train 😂😂,btohqsg
i raise you a best watch,btohqsg
Will your model 3 given the option to change to BYD blade battery? Tesla is gonna use BYD's blade battery on model 3 and model Y,btohqsg
I think Chan chun sing fave watch,btohqsg
No and I think is for model y only,btohqsg
Battery technology advanced very fast maybe 2 years time I change car is 4680 liao,btohqsg
Totally late as usual but THiS 🥰🥰,btohqsg
Haha which one. Bmw or merc? Haha,btohqsg
Same  i wouldn't have it otherwise,btohqsg
Haha it actually looks quite plain vanilla. Unassuming to the regular people,btohqsg
The merc has a much better stance imo,btohqsg
But in reality it brings you more men instead. Hahahaha,btohqsg
the devil is in the details and i find that is what's quite cool about them personally. envy you man,btohqsg
100% love for his ride. 👍,btohqsg
both damn nice either way haha,btohqsg
Hahaha a bit too sleeper  especially at low revs. Cant tell at all haha,btohqsg
Get one soon before the govt decides to get rid of all ice cars,btohqsg
I always like to recommend the citroen c5 aircross. Good value and not overpriced in this market,btohqsg
Of cos not as powerful or desirable as a bmw  but i think its good for what it is worth. Also not a cvt,btohqsg
By the way both are 3 cyl engines  even though the bmw unit shld be a little more refined  but i think it should be negligible,btohqsg
Oh sorry only 1.6 4 cyl available for the c5 now. Which is a good deal considering depre is still below 14k,btohqsg
i do like french cars but their reliability idk also haha,btohqsg
like some say good some say bad,btohqsg
if not i do like the DS7 crossback,btohqsg
Actually i dont really know why their reputation is so bad. Along with british cars. But the newer models camt be that bad?,btohqsg
I owned an alfa recently and didnt really think it was unreliable at all contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
Popular belief is wrong. Because it’s based on hearsay.,btohqsg
Sleeper is good sir. I love those cars where people see or hear it and they go “wait a minute … is that a … “ vs those that try too hard with piercing raspy exhaust only. Personally Low rev E9x m3  merc V8s just make my day. Admittedly they attract fellow males mostly wahahaha so really depends on what one is looking for in his / her ride.  The (lifter+induction?) sound of the E9x S65 is just so unique and amazing at Low revs from the outside. I remember hearing it in real life in Germany when it was recently launched back then and I asked myself “wait what car was that!?”,btohqsg
What’s there not to love about the sound of a free breath  free rev NA V8?,btohqsg
Which is the mistake many buyers make sometimes. Best to do proper research,btohqsg
@fatty_peachI’d also like to recommend checking out the Korean suv or EVs too.they’re good value for what they can deliver whether performance  looks or functionality.,btohqsg
all conti are basically not much problem first 100k. their real real reliability test is after 100k,btohqsg
My take is cars are like relationships. It’s all about how you take care of them. If you don’t consider their needs and neglect them  they will likely give you trouble after the honeymoon period.,btohqsg
good morning! it doesn't represent actual wealth in any way contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
Contrary to popular belief that salary is not increasing ppl can still buy new cars,btohqsg
Property included. So u stay in condo u millionaire le,btohqsg
https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/13-spore-population-become-millionaires-2030-highest-proportion-among-asia-pacific-economies-hsbc-report-197163613% of S'pore population to become millionaires by 2030  highest proportion among Asia-Pacific economies: HSBC report,btohqsg
no surprise for the US. consumption driven economy,btohqsg
these 2 years stocks fly up like crazy and crypto beofre crash,btohqsg
13 pecent based on bank account alone??,btohqsg
i got read news one when i wait for my rickshaw customers to come,btohqsg
the report said primary residence is included,btohqsg
if not I think here aso alot millionaire😂😂,btohqsg
plus residence n bank account here almost all millionaire liao😛,btohqsg
Good morning everybody . Just join the community,btohqsg
Agreed  the induction noise is unreal. But from the outside only hahaha. In stock form  inside is not that fantastic below 3k rpm.,btohqsg
8.2k red line yo! Julian should have bought one to replace the fd2r lol,btohqsg
I mean generally most cars start to have minor issues after 100k. I think conti cars have more issues maybe due to the complexities  or over engineered? 1001 sensors here and there haha,btohqsg
It was new so i serviced at dealer,btohqsg
Window down or roof delete! 😁😁 or Eventuri time ☺️☺️,btohqsg
Haha yes in due course. Not due roof delete. The intake hahaha,btohqsg
Actually the e93 is the cheapest among all,btohqsg
what’s there not to love about a great sounding vert,btohqsg
Wah memories of US101 and Europe drives.,btohqsg
e93 m3 vert or the f83 are the best,btohqsg
if got bigger budget the SL500s and above and the conti GTs are the so niceeee,btohqsg
newer Alfa should be more reliable . their old ones plagued by their selespeed system,btohqsg
Makes sense too now that i think of it,btohqsg
If got even more budget will be a 458 speciale aperta hehe,btohqsg
Yup it is. they use a zf transmission now. And gone with the old electircal issues  but build quality is still lacking,btohqsg
ah yes but that one not as comfortable as a true gt car hehe,btohqsg
Does the Super variant (198hp) and Veloce variant (280hp) use the same engine?,btohqsg
some say Alfa Romeo use Ferrari engine😛😛,btohqsg
The masses who said likely haven't owned before,btohqsg
i got a feeling too haha,btohqsg
i really love the giulia though,btohqsg
Mercedes-Benz shows off the tech-laden interior of the upcoming EQE SUVItsinterior clearly draws inspiration from the flagship EQS with its massive MBUX Hyperscreen being the standout feature🤩👉🏻 React with 🤩 if you think the interior of the Mercedes-Benz EQE is GORGEOUS!👉🏻 React with 🤔 if the interior of the Mercedes-Benz EQE is not your cup of tea!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
So good looking the new designs. Alfa never grows wrong with their looks 👍🏼,btohqsg
Have leh have leh! Quadrifoglio woot woot!!!!!!!,btohqsg
AMG GT Roadster for me anytime if I have the unlimited money hack downloaded.,btohqsg
similar layout  bore  stroke etc...they really just did cut 2 cylinders,btohqsg
296gtb and giulia qv uses the F154 V6 engine,btohqsg
Thats true. 1st world problem haha.,btohqsg
Ya they ditched the dct. Zf is quick enough i guess and responsibility not on bmw,btohqsg
can develop the car more haha since zf is trusted,btohqsg
Ya a lot of people say its the same block just less 2 cyl. But cant confirm haha,btohqsg
but this sounds super heavenly mann,btohqsg
Ya definitely one one of the best sounding v6s,btohqsg
how was your stelvio ownership though?,btohqsg
It was fun  steering is super responsive and very on point. Body roll is evident but way way less. Sounds cliche but it doesnt behave like an suv.,btohqsg
The car is much lighter compared to its peers and its very obvious,btohqsg
Sad. The DCT was one of my favs. Just awesome listening to it so it’s thing. ZF is now too.. smooth and digital (sorry if that doesn’t make sense).,btohqsg
if what you crave is the downshift throttle blip  the alfa QVs do have that too in a racier setting,btohqsg
issit the zf cannot blip or smt haha,btohqsg
and is the auto rev match,btohqsg
or the opposite. can’t rmb someone told me smt abt it,btohqsg
Even the upshifts are nice to me. The shift aggression in setting 5 or 6 is just awesome on high revs,btohqsg
wah which rickshaw customer let u drive his qv hahaha,btohqsg
Then no 8 banger things leh,btohqsg
I only read about it and pirate stream old Top Gear episodes in between customers 😛,btohqsg
Ignore me. I crave many things I can’t afford.,btohqsg
hahaha for a period of time in my life i unsubscribed all the motoring channels and news and pages,btohqsg
take your time  enjoy what you have and work towards the dream,btohqsg
Just wondering what do you guys think of the Alfa Stelvio,btohqsg
Pre face lift bro. Thanks for the compliment! 👍,btohqsg
Yes  when I had my RS5 back then  it sounded great.,btohqsg
dct don't last in city driving,btohqsg
What’s an actual price that you’ll accept for an A3 2018 1.0?Good transacting price for seller,btohqsg
What should you do if someone steals your car overseas?Losing your car while overseas is a distressing thing  but it is important to know what to do next instead of panicking.👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 if you find this advice article useful!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
but as a seller  95-100 wld be good to me,btohqsg
I would suggest getting the 1.4 CoD though,btohqsg
Fuel efficiency is similar but drive is better,btohqsg
the other SUV thats great to me  is Seat Cupra Formentor. drives hard and handles well,btohqsg
Oil change done outside twice.Remaining repairs done at PA,btohqsg
Good car but my only worry is parts availability. Alfas have gotten better in terms of reliability but the issue is that if and when they do break  service centre and independents don't tend to have parts in stock and due to supply chain issues  parts can take a very long time to arrive,btohqsg
i think it wld be a good price,btohqsg
Therefore I would go with a macan S or higher based on which variant of the stelvio you compare with,btohqsg
Anyone wants to buy at 95k?,btohqsg
95k in the current market good,btohqsg
Sgcarmart sure want to buy  can sell through bidding or through the ads,btohqsg
Need to pay…pain and no guarantee will sell at 95k though…,btohqsg
I would suggest doing the bidding on sgcm and other platforms to get a gauge of the price dealers offer you,btohqsg
Usually can get 4 to 6k more,btohqsg
For most entry to mid tier contis,btohqsg
I shall not name the platform as I'm afraid of being banned but a competitor of sgcm does free evals and only makes you pay when you sell,btohqsg
good info.. many  thanks for sharing.. Alfas  reliability is much better now.. I use to remember it have Alfas having itsown idiosyncrasies,btohqsg
But sgcm bidding fetches higher price,btohqsg
Although you need to pay 68 dollars for the inspection,btohqsg
From my experience and a few other people I've talked to,btohqsg
They are like civic and Corolla,btohqsg
But both logo got colors of singapore,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminDo you think golf is a sport,btohqsg
u wan start another war isit,btohqsg
I am mr pete in disguise,btohqsg
You're trying to rile up Mr Xun,btohqsg
But remember  he is a trickster,btohqsg
He can get you banned like Mr Pete,btohqsg
Later sgcm say r&j complicit then we lose them how,btohqsg
Time for a new batch of admins I guess,btohqsg
If you are referring to a sporty golf  I would recommend you the GTI or R if you prefer AWD🙂-R,btohqsg
i heard a golf r do a pull today,btohqsg
so good and the exhaust didn’t sound artificial like some 1.4s,btohqsg
no decided to throw logic away,btohqsg
tmr’s used car post is a Golf R that I think is pretty nice-R,btohqsg
tbh golf r with the 3d gel plate damn nice haha,btohqsg
Gotta ask how many GB has he been thru already 😂,btohqsg
elon launch tesla into spacethis guy launching his pistons into space,btohqsg
"""eh bro why ur car got built in rocket""",btohqsg
honestly golf R is nice as it is,btohqsg
All golf GTi and R are nice. Period,btohqsg
mk5 was game changer in hot hatch game,btohqsg
last time where got such thing as 200 hp and fast gb,btohqsg
GTi invented by VW in the late 80s. The hot hatch era thus began,btohqsg
Yes. Now even MPV is 200hp.,btohqsg
The one good car then was the ford escort xr,btohqsg
there’s a stage 1.5 sharan on sale,btohqsg
Very fast car. The Peugeot 205 GTi. Beautiful,btohqsg
300hp sia haha that’s quite sick,btohqsg

Must enquire more to find out I guess-R,btohqsg
Some people when they list  they don't like to put the mileage. Probably because it's high - J,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA lta needs to wakeuptheiridea ah,btohqsg
I didn't win... congrats to the winners!!!,btohqsg
genuine question.. these days when people list  more and more i find they write all kind of stories like... female owner  use only for groceries  genuine seller  always drive slow etc etc.. why don't SGCM just remove all the unnecessary information since they are mostly LIES anyway?,btohqsg
150k 6 owners well taken care of,btohqsg
So fast for 330Bhp? Is it a light car? I doubt it,btohqsg
I feel the more they write the more they trying to cover up things😂😂,btohqsg
A Grand Tourer Injection (from Italian Gran Turismo Iniezione) - abbreviated to GTI or GTi - is a fuel-injection car model variant. Traditionally used for grand tourer cars  the term is now applied to various hot hatchbacks  even though they do not have the luxury traditionally associated with grand tourers.The 1961 Maserati 3500 GTi is the first car to use the GTI name[1] that was later made famous in 1976 with the Volkswagen Golf GTI and also by the Peugeot 205 GTi launched in 1984.,btohqsg
It a car is driven slow then it’s broken and bad,btohqsg
Unable to tell what is a lie or what isn't tho - J,btohqsg
Impossible 4.2 seconds for 330Bhp. Impossible,btohqsg
but 4.2 for stage 2 abit slow,btohqsg
seen sub 4 w stage 2 before,btohqsg
The bmw m3 is 420 bhp and can only do 4.4 seconds,btohqsg
it is really quite fast in a straight line,btohqsg
With COE that freaking high  don’t think it’s going to be cheap anytime soon. Sigh,btohqsg
quattro means their 4wd system la haha,btohqsg
like how xdrive and all4 is for bmw and mini and 4matic for merc,btohqsg
just that quattro more renown cos it’s launch and grip is really exceptional,btohqsg
5.2 seconds. To bs it by 1 second without substantial power increase is too much.,btohqsg
must use dragy they good haha,btohqsg
I was referring to price before COE. COE is standard for all cars  but since the hyundai evs will be made in singapore  there might be a lower ARF or lower price due to no import duties on the car,btohqsg
this quite nice though  but NA mileage and 6owners i abit scared,btohqsg
with a tune it’s possible laa give the ad benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
the car is not at 333hp anym,btohqsg
This is m3. 4.3 seconds approximately.,btohqsg
we talking abt a car w more horsepower and awd,btohqsg
the import duties is negligible with respect to the coe price. Anyway Hyundai aso not cheap these day .the price is same like japs,btohqsg
So if boosted power than it’s no longer 330bhp,btohqsg
where got stage 2 and no change to figures,btohqsg
when u beat everybody on kzkw,btohqsg
Sir  I'm not saying cheap in general. There is a term called relativity. Cheaper relatively  compared to other EVs that would come in as imports,btohqsg
A 2010 car is for all the coe is still quite new when taken good car,btohqsg
the definition of stage is endless,btohqsg
no we are not trying to define what stage. We are explaining the car isnt stock,btohqsg
If he’s done it why didn’t he mention new power output,btohqsg
sgcm ads use the car stats when new,btohqsg
I don’t  are what sgcm what not.,btohqsg
It isn't very wise to put it out in the ad,btohqsg
he never put 333 in his description laaa haha,btohqsg
And everyone doesn't Dyno their cars,btohqsg
dyno only useful if u do before and after,btohqsg
please  dont start  another fee for dyno for inspection. tonglong ah,btohqsg
can see the gains espc if the car has lost power due to age,btohqsg
Not just that. If his tune is not custom,btohqsg
He might have a benchmark given already from the tuner,btohqsg
tbh even if i racechip i’d dyno for fun,btohqsg
Everyone doesn't mention everything in their listing,btohqsg
got a lot of ads say mod list upon viewing,btohqsg
later some cocker go parliament  come out new policy every inspection cycle must dyno. i cry,btohqsg
The seller doesn't need to mention,btohqsg
Taken from LTA data that sgcm produces,btohqsg
u read his description he never mention haha,btohqsg
wait lemme read again in case i wrong,btohqsg
And as a seller  you cannot change this info,btohqsg
description never write on flywheel or on wheel,btohqsg
It is taken automatically basis the carplate,btohqsg
He could have described the new power after stage 2. Does the stock mentione 4.2 seconds?,btohqsg
It’s like saying his 330 bhp machine can do 4.2 🤣,btohqsg
sub 5s possible even with normal a4s4 should be nth tbh haha,btohqsg
He doesn't get to choose the power output displayed,btohqsg
How are you not able to understand a simple thing like this,btohqsg
that’s ur perception of it lo haha,btohqsg
4.2 second but never use proper equipment  maybe not accurate one,btohqsg
Sucks. Really you don’t see the finer points.,btohqsg
u see all the modded golf R adssgcm say 300 but u rly think those w meth and tunes pushing 300 still meh haha,btohqsg
Why’s he able to describe 4.2 seconds?,btohqsg
He has also listed some of his mods,btohqsg
u got dragy app can go see,btohqsg
If standard then use all standard measurements numbers,btohqsg
Description and features  both have limited characters,btohqsg
What is the 4.2 seconds mentioned. Is this part of standard info,btohqsg
i won’t mention my hp or all my mods when i sell my car tbh,btohqsg
Got authorities seeing this stuff too,btohqsg
sell car  mod has no value one,btohqsg
but if his car rly does 4.2 why not,btohqsg
the petrolheads will see and get interested,btohqsg
But it is something the owner believes is a point to mention to attract interest,btohqsg
You want to ask for more numbers,btohqsg
Then why not mentioned 500 bhp which is tuned,btohqsg
maybe he never dyno so don’t know,btohqsg
u ask me i ask who,btohqsg
i can go message the guy ah but i dw waste his time,btohqsg
Or he doesn't want to mention to the world,btohqsg
+ it’s a dealer car not direct owner,btohqsg
maybe owner never disclose all haha,btohqsg
just saying reasons why he MAY NOT have mentioned more stuff 😆,btohqsg
haha the listing is by a dealership,btohqsg
if direct owner i’ll text him js for u man mr winner,btohqsg
I think same as the price LOL😂,btohqsg
This is dejavu all over again,btohqsg
let ppl believe in what they want,btohqsg
smell alot of ego talking  prefer not to argue,btohqsg
i will just throw memes here,btohqsg
So slow 😉. M3 has launch control too.,btohqsg
Car features that are super useful in Singapore and (some that are just plain lame)Getting a new car that comes loaded with a bunch of features doesn't mean it's a good deal because car features are only worth the money if you use them often.#FACTS👉🏻 React with 👏🏻 if you agree!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
All wheel drive can be useful,btohqsg
Not for the purpose of off-roading (4WD better for that not AWD  2 different things),btohqsg
But for the purpose of power delivery  rain driving  etc.,btohqsg
Also Blindspot monitoring is something a lot of people here need sadly,btohqsg
Auto High beam on Lexus and Toyota is a pain,btohqsg
Have seen many drivers using the lights on auto which is fair,btohqsg
But they don't realize that the car has decided to use high beams on inner roads or coming out of dimly lit exits and blinding oncoming traffic,btohqsg
May I object to the use of the word “Lame” sir 🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻🙋🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
Strong leh.. hahahaa. Some features are indeed important for some drivers as we have seen,btohqsg
But need to buy the device,btohqsg

Looks like there is a new replacement here anyway,btohqsg
had to pull out my special powers of baiting,btohqsg
1.0 got slightly more power but lower spec,btohqsg
1.2 less power but spec better I think,btohqsg
Can go look at these around the same price too,btohqsg
Ah i see..ok i check out other,btohqsg

Full tank 300Litre 😂 road legal,btohqsg
Hahaha all the owners would be happy to even see 5km/L,btohqsg
And in total silent fashion. Anson Byun says it well regarding enjoying the overall driving experience as a petrol head 😊 (he is that E93 M3 6MT dude). He is one guy who legit is enjoying his ride and not doing it for anyone else  nor trying to prove anything to anyone on the road.,btohqsg
Yup that why I buy 5.5 k is really cheap in comparison,btohqsg
Better than me haven't heard anything eversince participating the 1st contest 😂,btohqsg
