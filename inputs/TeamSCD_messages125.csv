It is harder to spot a starlet on road than a lambo if u realised 😂,btohqsg
The rarity itself is well worth the price😂,btohqsg
but starlet dun hav the value of a Lambo,btohqsg
i personally have seen 2 others... a brown one always around siglap and a dark maroon one driven by an old aunty at upper changi,btohqsg
Sentimental value is priceless..esp passed down cars through the generations,btohqsg
