Hi Chris. Any reason for VOO  as compared to IVV?,btohqsg
Same  probably some other bank may start think to have 12 months consecutive üòÇ,btohqsg
https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison/IVV/VOOIVV and VOO are both exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  meaning they are traded on stock exchanges and can be bought and sold throughout the day. IVV is a passively managed fund by iShares that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. It was launched on May 15  2000. VOO is a passively managed fund by Vanguard that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. It was launched on Sep 7  2010. Both IVV and VOO are passive ETFs  meaning that they are not actively managed but aim to replicate the performance of the underlying index as closely as possible. IVV has a 0.04% expense ratio  which is higher than VOO's 0.03% expense ratio.,btohqsg

POSB Everyday also. But now I think also need to hit $800.,btohqsg
(About POSB Everyday Card)Does anyone know if i made the purchase on 28feb  is the cashback for feb or mar? because i was a few bucks short in feb to hit $800.because i called to check they day they follow post date and not transaction date. but when the bill came it didnt even show post date and only the date of transaction. when i called again they just tell me to see whats the cashback and it is what it is...,btohqsg
Think it's transaction date as they keep tracker till 11th of the following month.,btohqsg
Hi.... can i use maybank platinium and amaze card? Use the amaze card to pay at axs and the transaction still consider eligible for rebate?üò¨,btohqsg
maybank Platinum is a visa  can't link to amaze,btohqsg
also cannot use Amaze card on AXS,btohqsg
Income insurance does not allow credit card payment on their website,btohqsg
I think if it‚Äôstaobao.comit‚Äôs CNY if it‚Äôs taobao app then it‚Äôs all sgd,btohqsg
Is spending on shopee eligible for Citibank spent for gift promo?,btohqsg
"https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/90-degrees-travel-credit-card#popup-cardupAnyone tried this ""cardup"" option? Worth it?",btohqsg
https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etfThanks Chris  however IVV expense ratio is same as VOO at 0.03%?,btohqsg
Hi does uob evol app show how much you spend on online and contactless?,btohqsg
does anyone know if $300 DBS cashback promo occurs frequently? I‚Äôm thinking on whether to utilise the $150 cashback promo now or wait for a $300 promo in the future,btohqsg
Do you all think Maybank SG will fail/collapse üòÇ,btohqsg
Why Maybank SG will fail when they‚Äôre too big to fail in MY? RHB maybe  because their IT are like DBS‚Äôs  but Maybank?,btohqsg
Not sure leh  just someone told me even if covered under SDIC might not recd payout cos smaller commercial banks is not DSIB.,btohqsg
Maybank deposits are under SDIC. Under 75K confirm guaranteed sure can take money even if Maybank has Bank Run (Choy Choy),btohqsg
300 is abt the max I have seen. Last year also saw the flash deal arnd last quarter of the year,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs what I thought too but Just like any insurance fund  when it ran out of cash  there is nothing you can do,btohqsg
It is just a company Limited guarantee by Company Act,btohqsg
Except that if you have 75K or less in a bank  it will be guaranteed. You will definitely be paid if something happens.Yes company act applies but there‚Äôs a reason banks are regulated in Singapore.,btohqsg
Hear ppl say SDIC may not be full proof,btohqsg
Without knowing how big the fund size of SDIC  not sure whether every account will be insured fully up to $75k.Btw  as of 2021  the total commercial bank deposits was $1.5trillion.With the UBS-credit Suisse merger  and the SVB Signature banks collapse  a lot of funds are rushing into HK and Singapore.So  with a higher base  will the SDIC fund still be sufficient?,btohqsg
With bigger deposit during high arbitrage   when they able to buy bonds and make profit straight away. Chances to fail is more silm.,btohqsg
Hmm I‚Äôm now thinking twice that‚Äôs why asking around to see what you guys think üòÇ,btohqsg
Noob question are we able to pay for all Credit card by doing fast transfer to the card number? Or is this a only for some banks thing?,btohqsg
Another noon question. Can I double dip kris+ 4mpd with if i link my google pay with say dbs vantage and get 5.5 miles per dollar on top of the purchase counting towards my sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Kris+ right now is the double dipping goodness Now is can use Kris+ then go shopback then favepay,btohqsg
how to use kris+ then go shopback then favepay?,btohqsg
What I mean isIf can use Kris+ then if don‚Äôt have to shopback   if don‚Äôt have go favepay,btohqsg
So priority on Kris+ if can use and also some kris+ merchant got 10% discount like gong Cha,btohqsg
Does the coe loan allow early redemption without penalty? if it does  can always redeem if UOB or fixed deposit rate fell below the 2.88%.Seem like a good idea  just google and saw some car refinancing at 2.78% .. might want to explore that.,btohqsg
Nope. Would love to see the breakdown also,btohqsg
Hi all  if anyone of you intend to topup grabpay using Amex TCB before the nerf to pay Insurance or other things please take note Grab recently just quietly updated in their system to change some merchant to require transferable amount even to pay online transactions.As of now my Insurance from prudential is affected by this secret update and probably affects all other insurance companies as well.Please check first before top upSome screenshots for y‚Äôall to refer,btohqsg
Anyone here buys US municipal bonds?,btohqsg
Thank you for informing but luckily I  managed to pay for my insurance on 27 marchMy insurance is prudential and I paid via their iPay,btohqsg
Same I paid via ipay as well. It‚Äôs changed already,btohqsg
wah i also kena this in the afternoon...,btohqsg
any instarem users can enlighten me... i read that the 1% cashback that used to be upfront now becomes instapoints but still equates to 1% - but only gets awarded on foreign transactions?,btohqsg
