you MUST NOT argue this way. there will be outliers in its own stable. but you got to argue based on what many of the models it sells.,btohqsg
And did I say ALL their cars are drop dead gorgeous?,btohqsg
i am giving you an EXAMPLE to rebut what you said,btohqsg
I am rebutting you because you said this,btohqsg
bmw make cool awesome cars like M3 touring,btohqsg
it is just a reliable utility vehicle,btohqsg
but make cars that hmmm... cars like the dorito shaped 2 series,btohqsg
And all I said was their recent models are nice and give credit. There is no need to jump and rebutt and split hairs,btohqsg
every bmw is enjoyable to drive. thatis their hallmark,btohqsg
Hyundai has improved leaps and bounds i have to say,btohqsg
but in terms of looks i cannot say,btohqsg
thatis why i said it is an outlier. ioniqu,btohqsg
new Ioniq 5  avante  and many other new models are refreshing to see,btohqsg
Have u driven an x1? How is that enjoyable?,btohqsg
Avante is such a good car if u want ur first new car,btohqsg
I30 is pretty decent for a sporty hatch! I30n sounds damn good too,btohqsg
Someone will call it outlier and no count,btohqsg
correct. but one or two models dont change people's perception on thisd,btohqsg
Yes. I heard this one irl,btohqsg
they are becoming better i feel,btohqsg
lets be grateful they are moving in the right direction,btohqsg
Staria  Pallisade  Tucson all great cars,btohqsg
You’re the one who feel the need to lecture and rebutt.,btohqsg
The Hyundai starex is nice as well,btohqsg
Hyundai Kona Hybrid is one of the best EV i feel are out there,btohqsg
"light = efficient   i think it will be the new EV ""corolla""",btohqsg
And the ioniq 6 and 7 looks super nice,btohqsg
all in all  they are no where near german makes but they are moving in the right direction,btohqsg
Looks in one thing  material and build quality is another. Euro makes will triumph japanese and korean makes in the aspect  till u reach the more premium vehicles,btohqsg
I’m appreciating cars. Someone is jumping at throats.,btohqsg
Yes. Even in their mass market models  they have really come a long way in their “feel of the cabin”: NVH  buttons  dash etc,btohqsg
dont get me wrong tho  i will agree that the old Hyundai was abit outdated during its launch and was never so appealling  probably a decade ago. But ever since the new generation has came out  it has always been getting better and better,btohqsg
Yes they were very woody and boxy back then,btohqsg
Why dont SGCM have a meet at showrooms! where community members go to showrooms  experience the cars and interview community members on their thoughts!@SGCM_Admin,btohqsg
i saw a probably 15+yo avante in the morning,btohqsg
which cars are not woody n boxy long long ago. it's the trend then😂,btohqsg

many people think volvo are boring LOL  which i partially agree,btohqsg
I have been saying to folks.. the new Volvo design language has been very refreshing too across the range. It is no longer the erm.. erm.. boxy looks it used to be,btohqsg
but... but... i like boxy too HAHA,btohqsg
thats why i like 90s car,btohqsg
but i think mass market prefer flowing lines so i guess for the survival of the company  the new deisgn would suffice,btohqsg
plus its one of the best designs in my opinion,btohqsg
yes. cut lines  shoulder lines  flares  arches,btohqsg
Volvo under ford was never profitable... and many volvo employees were retrenched. that was when the swede gov made AB Volvo buy over Volvo cars and was eventually sold to Geely. Im sure the chinese are profit chasing which i feel is okay because im sure wldnt want the company to become bankrupt. Nevertheless  despite their subtle cost cutting methods  they willmake very good looking cars,btohqsg
the sensible would do what needs to be done to sell cars.,btohqsg
yet wearnes still cant sell volvos😂😂😂,btohqsg
Volvo should have its pricing advantage because the total basic cost is lower  but yet wearnes still choose to take a big chunk,btohqsg
My opinion is that wearnes is not risk taking.,btohqsg
Petestill waiting for your venti HUD picture sir,btohqsg
