Looking into getting lasik done at private clinic (eagle eye). what are your thoughts on the strategy of AMEX krisflyer for the welcome bonus to clock miles? Used to own one but cancelled 2 years ago should be considered as new-to-bank customer right? Interested in finding out other strategies as well to clock miles.amaze + cmrc doesnt work for me as I am still holding on to the VISA version of citi rewards.,btohqsg

hi  what's everyone opinion on first CC if i were to compare between UOB lady card vs citibank premier miles?using the card for daily spending (more on dining & food/online spending) and looking for miles/conversion of milesand whether i should pair with AMAZE?,btohqsg
Lady is specialist card. Premier miles is general card. Can't really compare. U can pair citi reward with Amaze for 4mpd.,btohqsg
specialist card in a sense that because of the preferred category?,btohqsg
Hi all  looking to confirm some queries on OCBC 360 account.1) Just opened OCBC 360 account yesterday. For the Save criteria  i‚Äôm assuming this will qualify as long as my MAB goes above $500 for the month as reference to ‚Äúprevious month‚Äù will be to $0 as account is newly opened is that correct?2) also on the Save criteria  is the MAB in comparison to balances following calendar month? (ie. 30 Apr  my MAB is $100 000  on 1 May if i top up to $100 500 and hold no lesser than that for the entire month of May  my MAB would have been said to increase by $500?3) on Spend criteria of spending $500 on 90n card  is the spending criteria counted based on posting date or transaction date? (eg. If i paid via paywave on 30 Apr  and the transaction is only posted on 4th May  does it count as Spend criteria for May or Apr?)4) on Salary criteria  does it matter on which date in the month salary is credited to your account? eg as long as salary is credited ($1800 and above) via a corporate bank account between 1st Apr and 30 Apr  it qualifies and fulfils salary criteria for Apr?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  Stash account March monthly ave bal has $1k  can just deposit 100k on 30 Apr to participate April slot promo to receive cash credit in May  and earmark end 16Aug? Must still keep Mar bal 1k throughout the 4 months? Thanks,btohqsg
ALTERNATIVE VIEW:If you have big foreign currency spending ($50k per year) you can consider using PRVI Amex... get free limo as well as 20 000 bonus miles as well as guaranteed annual fee waiver,btohqsg
2) Yes  u can track ur save balance on ocbc website ibanking  app cannot. if 1st of the month is PH or weekend it wont count so be careful on that  if u only top up 500 on the first of the month and the 1st is weekend  average increase wont be 500. will be less cos the first few days balance still using the previous month end balance which wasnt ph or weekend3) posting date. May4) doesnt matter. yesu can also double check with ocbc via hotline but this is how it works for me,btohqsg
How about uob krisflyer + amaze combo? Is it good?,btohqsg
this in my opinion only good if you happen to have a MASSIVE luxury goods spend that is within the white list MCC (better double check and triple checked with amaze+empty wallet before you do).e.g. branded watch or branded bag.,btohqsg
and of course you must spend $800 within SQ Group,btohqsg
