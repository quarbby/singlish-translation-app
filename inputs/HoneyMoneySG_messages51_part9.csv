hm  strange question. Depends more on what u paying and how much,btohqsg
hi does anyone know whether virgin active membership can qualify under UOB EVOL min spend,btohqsg
Hi. I am planning to further study. The course is estimated 28k and i can pay via Cash.Should i use credit cards to make payment then use cash to pay off the credit cards to score points?If yes  any suggestion what credit cards to take?At the moment i only have standard chartered credit card for my house reno loan.Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
My HSBC revolution card showsUsed -415.89 â€” what I owe to bankRewards points 416,btohqsg
Now what does this mean. Can i offset my 415.89 with the rewards points.,btohqsg
u spent $415.89 and earned 416 points? 9x points to be credited next month,btohqsg
9*416 = 3744 points in the month of August??,btohqsg
And how much 3744 would be if i convert them to cash?Is it 1 point = 1 cent,btohqsg
in Jul. 3744 points assuming all your spending eligible for bonus points,btohqsg
4 000 Reward Points for SGD10 and every incremental SGD1 at 400 rewards points thereafter.,btohqsg
Why ? Is there any new updates ?,btohqsg
Hi any links to the article for the nerf of Citi and Amaze?,btohqsg
I'm a bit late on this news.,btohqsg
This is very minor only le.,btohqsg
Main use still remains unaffected for mostThis seems newly added according to sethisfyAMAZE* AXSAMAZE* EZ-linkAMAZE* TRANSITBut overall majority users wont be affected I think,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the use of Amaze* AXS? Does any card give rewards for it?,btohqsg
No idea  just saw inside the link provided,btohqsg
no lah only nerfed for using Amaze+citi for ezlink  bus/mrt  AXS  transit,btohqsg
There are no major nerfs to the main usage of amaze e.g. citi rewards single card strategy (for now).The new exclusions are not the main usage of amaze.Don't false alarm.,btohqsg
Now cannot even use Amaze on AXS,btohqsg
Yeah minor nerf only exclude bus/mrt rides,btohqsg
Hello whatâ€™re the best cards for travel? amaze?,btohqsg
But for youtrip and trust lovers  stay tuned for tonight's video,btohqsg
Why keep on debateðŸ˜‚ already prove liao.,btohqsg
Lol I am one of those whom no matter what evidence u show me I will still conclude that trust card is the best card to use overseas,btohqsg
just curious  i notice those high salary / Privilege banking CC have some very meh reward/ cashback rate. Worst than normal everyday use cards.why do you guys think bank make it that way? Only decent 1 seems to be the Ladies Solitare Card,btohqsg
UOB Lady SolitaireCiti Prestige Master2 of the best cards now if you are into Miles.,btohqsg
my question is why are they so terrible. like Citi prestige only have 1.3 MPD. Why bother.,btohqsg
Trust card garantee reliable smooth transactions    no amaze frequent overseas transactions hiccups  trust card has good rates so itâ€™s the best card to use overseas haha,btohqsg
Actually itsUOB Lady SolitaireAmaze + UOB Krisflyer CC,btohqsg
But trust need spend Ntuc & other & min sum unless use this for overseas but don't care of point,btohqsg
I am referring to overseas usage,btohqsg
Overseas usage must refer to the current promo prevailing.like last month the best card to use overseas is UOB Krisflyer without Amaze.,btohqsg
Yes. I will say bring both. Just in case  any issue with amaze use trust,btohqsg
The attractiveness is no ceiling for the benefits. The rich can one shot pay $10K for a meal. No credit card can give high bonus for that kind of spend..,btohqsg
so high income / potentially high spenders get shit rewards?sounds about right ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
they even willing to pay annual fees,btohqsg
Because if u making a few Millions a year. You will not want to waste time on rewards.,btohqsg
Lol thatâ€™s true   as what Ramit Sethi says stop asking the $3 qn,btohqsg
Big earners donâ€™t wanna waste time managing CC with only 1k limit for 4mpd. $600 for cashback. 1 card settle all,btohqsg
of course if you're the 50+ mil networth kind of folk this kind of $3 wont matter.but if you're the 15k/mth- 25k you still care. You'll still want to take that first class suite & you probably wont want to be spending $20k cash to sit it,btohqsg
15-25k ppl  in current time frame is not hard to find,btohqsg
exactly and there is no CC that is that attractive to them  aside say 1.5 cards or those 1k spend CC.,btohqsg
is amaze or youtrip better for EURO spending in europe?,btohqsg
All the 120k -500k cards since they might be traveling abit more .,btohqsg
amaze wallet has best rates  amaze + crmc has best net cashback (after 30 June 12 noon),btohqsg
