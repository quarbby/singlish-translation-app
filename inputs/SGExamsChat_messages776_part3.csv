A more geographical determinist view in some sense.,btohqsg
i thought you talking about jc having 1-1 student teacher ratio,btohqsg
i think its not impossible in camb,btohqsg
The ratio itself isn't a determination more on what it entails tbh,btohqsg
If it's STEM even with higher ratio they all probably end up doing research u suck thumb also,btohqsg
ngl i kinda want to go camb but my parents def cant afford,btohqsg
and i think i dont really have a chance to for undergrad but i wanna go camb for grad studies,btohqsg
need worry abt Os first for me pein,btohqsg
idk i tbh also dont really want nus that much cause of the common core mods,btohqsg
but then idk where else i can go,btohqsg
i guess ill just focus on alvls lor,btohqsg
yimingso like for example your major in nus chs is biology but then you have to take mods (classes) that take up 1/3 of your curriculumaka you went uni to study biology but have to take subjects like design thinking and asian studies that you didnt sign up for,btohqsg
and the thing is its graded,btohqsg
so imagine ur PE  Art  music etc is all graded in O levels even though u didnt CHOOSE to take them,btohqsg
they even affect if u are able to get ur degree?,btohqsg
But u can SU for NUS,btohqsg
but to compete with students ard the world scary,btohqsg
polys are like this too I think,btohqsg
Theres a bunch of compulsory useless mods,btohqsg
every uni has the equivalent of these things,btohqsg
in some way shape or form,btohqsg
I have rose from the dead hahaha,btohqsg

This was exactly my feeling for chem prelims,btohqsg

So the feeling of getting A is foreign to him,btohqsg
Prof@kohsyan  can you explain to me why k=sqrt(2mE)/hand not k=sqrt(2m(E-V))/h?,btohqsg
