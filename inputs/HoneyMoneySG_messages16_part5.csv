Hi  long time lurker here planning to sign up for my first credit card (preferably cashback).Some background: have been working full time for more than a year  expenses are pretty low (~500 per month) and are mostly spent on food (mainly hawker food with payment by cash) and ez link top ups with the occasional online purchaseI  have some qns to ask:1) For stan chart credit card   which is more worth it   the stanchart unlimited cashback or the SMART card? I feel that while the unlimited cashback may suit my needs more  SMART card has higher cashback for categories that I use mainly and has no annual fees  which is quite a draw for me too2) Is it possible to link a bank account from a different bank to pay for credit card statements e.g using a dbs account to pay for bills charged to a stan chart credit card ?Appreciate any comments and suggestions on what type of cards to get !,btohqsg
1. Depends on what food you eat. If mostly fast food or coffee and toast  then get SC Smart. Otherwise SC Spree or SC Unlimited + Instarem Amaze may be better2. yes  should be available on ibanking,btohqsg
If this is your first SCB card  should just get SCB SMARThttps://hmsg.link/scbsmartfor the $300 offer. Spend $500  get $300 within 30 days. After that then decide again whether SimplyCash (Unlimited) or SPree or SMART is better for you,btohqsg
