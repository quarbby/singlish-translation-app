Honestly heres the facts u r not dafe anywhere so u dun have to avoid anywhere and they are sanitising the places where infected people have gone so u dun have to avoid the area (eg. today ri school break cause they are sanitising the school) and if u gna avoid ri student jus cause one kid has u might as well avoid all singaporean cause a singaporean got infected the logic dosen make sense right?? And like if u gna avoid might as well jus stay home. U cant do anyth about outside so just wash ur hands regularly practise personal hygeine and jus dun touch ur face and honestly.the fatality rate is so low and sg healthcare is so good honestly no need panic lol,btohqsg
I believe in our duty as citizens to prevent the further spread of meaningless hysteria.,btohqsg
its quite rude to keep saying avoid this kind of ppl that kind of ppl,btohqsg
In light of the current situation confronting us  we should be supporting each other as one Singapore family. Notwithstanding this disappointment  I am heartened that@fxliciaaand others have stepped up to offer your support and encouragement to fellow Singaporeans who need it.,btohqsg

It could jus be because hes in ite so like his frnds circle could be more of from ite and other similar schools so like he said elite cause its a part thats like not much of his social circle?? So yall dun have to be so picky abt it,btohqsg
I mean  elite school ppl are definitely different,btohqsg
The only thing me and elites got in common is ITE,btohqsg
