Hi all  need some opinions please. I recently chanced upon tbe Crypto cards fromcrypto.comwith the entry level cards already giving 2% cashback. Question is  is that a better cashback card than than the ones issued by banks?,btohqsg
uob amex absolute cashback. Or upgrade crypto card to jade green. Just if you willing to expose yrself with crypto.,btohqsg
On a side note. Huobi is exiting SG market. So for those with cryptos in Huobi  do transfer them out soon  either FTX  Gemini or Hodlnaut,btohqsg
not the most optimal :3best way is to useUOB Absolute or AMEX TCB to topup GrabPayGrabPay topup RevolutRevolut top-up CDC card (:so before you even start spending with the CDC card  you already have a 1.5% to 1.7% cashback at hand,btohqsg
but if you have specialised credit cards like a high Cashback card or high miles earning card then those might still be betterCDC CROback is only worthwhile when(1) the transaction doesn't earn anything on other cards(2) It's a big transaction that would exceed the bonus rates on other cards,btohqsg
U mean use credit card to buy crypto?,btohqsg
Use credit card to topup card?,btohqsg
The first question you should ask is if Gemini is safe. Because Earn is just a feature of it,btohqsg
crypto.comvisa card is a debit card. need to top up first,btohqsg
So it is actually use debit card. Hahaha,btohqsg

Thanks for your video on Miles Credit Card. Is getting miles in general more value per spending as compared to cash rebates?,btohqsg
it depends on your personal valuation of each mileand whether you aim to accumulate enough to redeem business or first class flightsif first class or business  each mile is worth 2 centsa 4 miles per dollar credit card would grant you 8 cents per dollar spending  that's a 8% rebate.in that context  it beats cash rebates,btohqsg
The thought process is:Do you want to fly first/business class flight?Yes: Do not use cash to buy  it's expensive. Accumulate miles using credit cards if your normal spending can achieve it (>$1000 monthly)No: don't touch miles card at all,btohqsg
And don't use miles to redeem economy flights. Most of the time it doesn't make sense (apart from some routes),btohqsg
Thanks! Miles cannot be used to get economy seats.?,btohqsg
miles can be used for any flight. more miles needed for higher cat of seats,btohqsg
what chris is saying is that the disparity in price based on cash terms between business and econ is so big that if you have accumulated miles to redeem a biz class ticket you should use miles instead of cash. correct me if im wrong  chris.,btohqsg
miles can be used to get Economy Class but the effort/reward ratio doesn't make sense there,btohqsg
and also ask per what Wil says above.,btohqsg
on a more reflective note while we can frown upon such generational wealth being made overnight  I think we need to give credit where credit is due:(1) younger folks have a much longer time horizon (Warren Buffett for example won't be big on BTC simply because the man doesn't have the time horizon to wait it out as someone aged 20 would)(2) younger folks have a different risk profile (they don't have the commitments that most working adults we do and that allows them to invest  whether we feel it's responsible or not is a separate question)- they grow up with different exposure- personally  I applaud that risk taking because even amongst their peers  they are the exception  not the norm.on a more balanced note(a) survivorship bias - for every young person that makes it  there are many others who got burnt(b) confirmation bias - these are exception  not the norm,btohqsg
