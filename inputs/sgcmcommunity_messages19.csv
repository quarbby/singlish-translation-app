today premium alm hit $4 leh,btohqsg
here i blast the e30 to 6000 regularly to decarbonize!,btohqsg
once a while must do Italian tuning to keep the Workshop away...,btohqsg
i only know change engine oils + filter. i never changed spark plugs though even after 140000km. NGK laser platinums  simply the best,btohqsg
and timing belts and associated pulleys tensioners  routinely.,btohqsg
oh i see. now i know.,btohqsg
unknowingly i have been doing this.,btohqsg
i just drive at high speed and high rpms. best,btohqsg
change oil and that is it,btohqsg
if conditions dont permit  i use low gear to use high engine rpm,btohqsg
your car condition must be good first of all  if not will create more problem,btohqsg
hahaha idiot sellin drugs here hahahahaha,btohqsg
not really. when i bought the 6-owners car with 152000km  i blasted at high speeds to make the engine better. it was sluggish at first. i dont care. under my care this is what i did. engine thrives when driven hard.,btohqsg
go spend in malaysia. just dont shout why so cheap,btohqsg
1st gear from Jurong to Changi ah,btohqsg
So just whack to make better ah,btohqsg
Blue is a very interesting colour actually,btohqsg
Is it matt wrap or gloss blue type?,btohqsg
Very deep meanings behind it as well,btohqsg
Tesla also  wack to keep battery pack hot,btohqsg
i made the engine better. unfortunately the timing belt broke a few months later because it is very sensitive to mileage interval where the ex owner did not keep a record when it's replaced. but the replacement of the belts and valves is so cheap you would not believe it. e30 parts. cheap.,btohqsg
🚨New sgCarMart Reviews video is out!!🚨Can You Road Trip An Electric Car? feat. BMW i4 M50 | sgCarMart Reviews➡️ Watch ithere!,btohqsg
So BMWs are reasonably priced when it comes to maintenance? Different from hearsay?,btohqsg
no no. that is valid only for old models like pre 1995 models,btohqsg
"where only one motronic is used.since 2000 when bmws becomes ""sophisticated"" with many sensors  things changed. they become more expensive to maintain.",btohqsg
like the e92  expensive to maintain,btohqsg
i know of wontonmee seller who sold his e46 after facing expensive gearbox repairs. costing many htousands. he got scared after two times.,btohqsg
how is it relative to other performance cars to maintain?,btohqsg
i hear stories of terrible VW expensive repairs too.,btohqsg
although i have never owned VW. but based on narratives and experiences from any VW owers. expenisve maintanence too,btohqsg
BMW Group Asia appoints Eurokars Auto Pte. Ltd. as second official BMW dealer in SingaporeThere are now two official BMW dealers here in Singapore!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you are a BMW fanboy/girl!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
maintainance is cheap for most conti. expensive is the repair,btohqsg
Performance motors so big and long serving also can’t 🛑 another competitor in this market,btohqsg
I will update you when BMW cars from Eurokars are listed on our website!😄,btohqsg
It will be intreasting   can now go each show room and ask for discount !!,btohqsg
Car got discount no use  COE still ex,btohqsg
Should be similar due to competition  their deals will have different structures probably with discounts  add ons included  etc.,btohqsg
TQ sir…. Officially should be same price,btohqsg
Eurokars has been dealing with BMW for a long time as the ADs for Rolls Royce and mini,btohqsg
We will find out soon enough😉,btohqsg
The key differences will probably be specs on units with different combinations and options specced or left unticked  structuring of package with free service packages or higher overtrades/discounts and the availability of stock,btohqsg
Must be right? If they can’t show they can take some volume….. BMW also can’t justify their decision to do this…..,btohqsg
Anyway from memory I dun tbink 2 official dealers hve ever happened here right?,btohqsg
my bet is eurkars will do better,btohqsg
So silly…. Go to showroom A and call SR B…. How ah? They offer this and that…..u can make it cheaper? Anyway lah:)),btohqsg
Consumers will rejoice unless the dealers collude and fix their margins up,btohqsg
the differences won't be too much after a while  only when they start of Eurokars will push a lot to get sales up because sales=service customers,btohqsg
Can’t avoid not talking about mazda,btohqsg
is Mazda the fave car brand here?😂,btohqsg
general consensus seems to be that,btohqsg
Mazda look really nice among the Jap brands.... no doubt,btohqsg
ERP rates will go up by $1 in stages from May 30 at 8 locations.More on the ones with rate rises only after the June school holidays:https://str.sg/wBHQ,btohqsg
Just saw a lot of less than a year tesla for sale. Not sure what this means... Car installment too ex to maintain or too fast to drive or got problem?,btohqsg
The PIs just buy and then put up for sale.,btohqsg
Most of them are from Car Choice SG if you noticed.,btohqsg
3 out of 10 are from sg car choice,btohqsg
rich man problem. they change cars like change gf,btohqsg
Wah  my gf of 8 years became my wife of 14 years,btohqsg
👍👍👍 Never thought of it this way 😂,btohqsg
What does that mean ? The listing is fake ?,btohqsg
I wouldn’t say fake but those are likely their 72 hours test drive cars.,btohqsg
So if they happen to sell them  then it’s a plus for them?,btohqsg
A few reasons1. As@mewmartsaid  PIs buy to keep ready stock and sell as compared to waiting for order from Tesla2. Some owners realise not practical for them and want to move back to ICE or prefer something else3. Due to the higher COE people are selling relatively lower mileage cars at a slightly higher price than they paid to earn a profit,btohqsg
Wah nothing escape your spy radar,btohqsg
Though I find it hard to feel that it’s not practical especially when Teslas will have SC access,btohqsg
The charging availability is much better than those random EVs,btohqsg
Agree  but to some they still prefer the usual ICE and can't adjust to EV lifestyle yet. Just personal preference that they might have,btohqsg
Fair enough. No right or wrong too,btohqsg
Ya sure got some ppl like such,btohqsg
or maybe they invest in luna,btohqsg
saw my neighbor look very stress smoking at carpark recently . holding on to a laptop. does not seem normal. hair also seem to grey overnite,btohqsg

LTA made the most profit from that piece of paper! Gahmen damn smart! Dr. M of Malaysia bang balls sia. He kick started Proton to have National car  we kick start COE back then. With high COE  it’s insane profit for LTA. Unbelievable jaw dropping! Fat Performance Bonus for LTA staff sia.,btohqsg
Some other car brands are also looking to do online sales and cut off the dealer   it should have saving back to consumers,btohqsg
U should change to an ev   as I think u really don’t bother about cars hehe,btohqsg

Government controls and of course makes profits. They decide policies how much you pay.,btohqsg
Be careful buying new cars. Economy going to tank big. Recessions next year.,btohqsg
Do not buy at the top. Coe is bound to come down,btohqsg
And sinkies always WhT this last just as in 2008.,btohqsg
I see my shares I thought already recession liao haha,btohqsg
Inflation rate is very high and they will fix this hard. So do not chase new cars.,btohqsg
Buy 5 year old cars if you must. No new cars,btohqsg
The equity markets now is a haven for traders.,btohqsg
7 consecutive weeks of falls has never been seen in modern days. Don’t play play.,btohqsg
Actually yes it is worth of money and don’t need take loan,btohqsg
Borrowing money to buy cars be careful. Do not get deep in debts,btohqsg
My wife always ask me buy a old car as don’t t need take loan,btohqsg
In 2018 when I accompanied my friend to test the Giulia  he immediately fell in love. But he needs to come up with 70k cash. It ain’t worth it. Today you. Can get a good used Giulia still with warranty for half that amount. The key is to control your urge.,btohqsg
I learned this hard lessons losing half of the value when I sold my car. I bought new.,btohqsg
After that I never bought new anymore,btohqsg
This sky high coe cannot sustain. It will fall.,btohqsg
Never lost la   when you sell cars you get back the money for the next purchase .Actually like you u said fianance wise best is to buy 5-6 years old car and don’t get loan,btohqsg
1995 coes also peaked. Then fell hard,btohqsg
I paid 144000 new and sold at 72000,btohqsg
Don’t get suckered into new cars,btohqsg
U put down 40% means u only loan 60% and the intreast is base on the 60% for the next 5 years if you loan for 5 years,btohqsg
Any bro advice on 08 WRX?,btohqsg
That is why ppl using the $0 drive away paying so much intreast,btohqsg
That’s not how you calculate you alway check how much you paid. And how much you got back,btohqsg
Thank .. due of service liao,btohqsg
If my loan is 5years I can depreciate among 5 heats   and car selling price is another thing,btohqsg
Yes cause car depreciation is very high for first 2 years,btohqsg
Calculate. How much you paid. And how much you get back. That’s it,btohqsg
There’s always a first time buying used. Be a man. Do it. You’ll appreciate how good this decision will turn out to be. After getting one used car I buy another and another,btohqsg
My previous car I down 80 k and loan 90 k   sell like 2 years plus and get back 90 k lol,btohqsg
My loan is 5 years   if I loan 3 years I get back more lol,btohqsg
Why so I loan 90 k does not mean I pay up 90 k,btohqsg
This ain’t worth it. Just my two cents. I’ve gone through this pain. So i shared with you all,btohqsg
That 90 k is on a full loan repayment schedule,btohqsg
How much is the car? How much did you sell. Simple,btohqsg
Have to go dig back liao I buy is 170 k,btohqsg
Banks won’t take losses. You take losses,btohqsg
Sell don’t really remember as I just trade in,btohqsg
I know ar that why I only loan 5 years,btohqsg
So you sold at 90k means you lost 80k,btohqsg
As ad said that the minimum,btohqsg
170 k is base on 5 years of loan plus down payment,btohqsg
I only drove 2 years plus and pay 2 years plus of down payment,btohqsg
So I buy the car at 170 k but I did not pay 170 k,btohqsg
Sure is lose money but not lose 80 k for 2 years la   if 80 k at 2 years my car depreciation is at 40 k liao,btohqsg
So how much you paid initially,btohqsg
And how much did you pay back bank to get back,btohqsg
That’s all I wanted to ask,btohqsg
I pay 132 k for like 2 years 10 month in total,btohqsg
Get back 90 k for my new car purchase and use it for down payment,btohqsg
And top up a little for current car,btohqsg
So my previous car depreciated 42 k for the 2 years 10 month lol,btohqsg
but will go up la. goodproduct.pluscapable founder with extraordinary track record,btohqsg
wonder if he will put space X for listing... this company burn money big time,btohqsg
My other 2 etf drop more then tesla,btohqsg
I am just a working middle class,btohqsg
In HWZ they call me bbfa,btohqsg
Dealers will always undercut by ~5k or more on market value when you trade in,btohqsg
they are not call dealer for nothing,btohqsg
Of course they got margin to worry about. But many car owners are lazy and refuse to look for options to sell higher,btohqsg
not easy to sell cars DIY. some ppl just come see see look look test yr car for fun,btohqsg
consignment u still need attend to buyers? cos I know u still get to use your car as normal,btohqsg
You just need to drive there at your convenience la,btohqsg
And usually no contact between the buyer and seller,btohqsg
Erm carro got selling thru consignment and selling thru dealer auction also haha... must choose the right one,btohqsg
So how much did you lose? Forget the trade in.,btohqsg
Say a buyer who wanted to buy a new car say bmw. He pays 300k new. And he sells it it is 200k 4 years later. He lost 100k right in 4 years?,btohqsg
Yes for 2 years 10 month as depreciation,btohqsg

Also determined by market demand. Alfa Romeo’s reputation is not very good in terms of reliability 🙏,btohqsg
Italian cars are usually not good with reliability  like Maserati,btohqsg
never own dont anyhow say italian no good! Alfa Romeo is reliable as heck. <- according to Mr X,btohqsg
Ar no just ppl speculating about it hehe sorry for that then,btohqsg
but fr  Maserati isnt the most reliable.. constant visits to the workshop etc.Also  Maserati old gearbox take years to go up to the next gear....the car just isnt suited for our climate IG,btohqsg
Ferrari n Lamborghini aso not reliable . but ppl love it😂,btohqsg
italians got a flair for style. which the Germans can't match...,btohqsg
u put a Porsche beside a Ferrari or Maserati. Porsche will look plain,btohqsg
sorry to Porsche owners here... u know who you are...😂😂. Porsche still look decent though😂😂,btohqsg
You put GT3RS beside Maserati GT  for sure the GT3RS will shine,btohqsg
but you ask a girl that knows nothing about cars  458 or 911 she cfm choose 458,btohqsg
I choose Porsche over Maserati in a heart beat,btohqsg
no hate to maserati owners hor  my father also used to own a maserati quat... which broke down alot,btohqsg
And Maserati is really slow compare to Porsche la oops,btohqsg
definitely . 😂😂. 911 some say look like frog in front,btohqsg

Recently I saw a 930 posted on a Singapore car spotting group on FB. Looks v good!,btohqsg

Need to be very careful with this gen  can be a steal or a money pit if it isn't well maintained  seen this unit  let's just say not on the top of recco list 🙃🙃,btohqsg
Can play  need to know your stuff and research well before buying,btohqsg

For me if I want to daily  Carrera S enough  no need 4S with AWD  can have some fun with the S and use the spare money for options :),btohqsg
Aiya you already EV man  taycan best for you. Later you go drive this car say the suspension gone feel vibration  is actually the engine 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Can sneak by also  depends on your spec,btohqsg
Even the base model is very loud liao,btohqsg
RS e-Tron GT gets more attention I feel,btohqsg
Taycan still looks like a panamera from afar to most,btohqsg
Not as loud as Taycan ba cause it a Porsche,btohqsg
Ppl respect the horse a lot 1,btohqsg
True  but in Singapore so many already  really feel like spotting Corolla sometimes. So many Porsche now,btohqsg
Because they are super reliable if maintained well  can renew COE very easily,btohqsg
If u compare to bba Porsche is the new standard,btohqsg
Bba is mass car with very low end model now,btohqsg
ya Porsche u won't see ppl stick phv label. Benz or BMW still have,btohqsg
but my wife see Porsche no feel. she dun feel anything special 😂,btohqsg
It's the chauffeur cars mostly from hotels or premium chauffeur co.s,btohqsg
Or the w212 e class like the comfort limo cab ones,btohqsg
This one really scam eh  actually just paying for the badge nothing else 😂😂😂,btohqsg
218 is still like c200 kind,btohqsg
Like base but can  still decent,btohqsg
sinkies are getting rich very fast... I remember last time when I student...see ppl driving a Benz is like some big shot car already,btohqsg
Porsche German  very focussed on the drive and tech. Not flamboyant as such like the Ferraris and lambos,btohqsg
That why now Porsche is the new standard,btohqsg
That's their market and they stick to it,btohqsg
btw@SGCM_Admini know got 216 cos i watch SGCM TT horrr,btohqsg
i know he is JJ also leh😂😂,btohqsg
nowadays u see ppl drive Benz... some might be poorer than you😂,btohqsg
These type of car can’t use for status la,btohqsg
I know a lot of rich ppl drive very normal car also haha,btohqsg
for the old uncle who wear Rolex . Benz is still a towkay car,btohqsg
If you use car for status no point  must buy car for what one likes and wants,btohqsg
Yeahh  gone are the days of flashy car meaning status or wealth,btohqsg
3 room HDB carpark aso alot flashy cars.,btohqsg
can see when u pass by,btohqsg
Which to me is something very nice  everyone across the board enjoying what they like rather than chasing public image. Still have people buying the badge also but to each their own,btohqsg
Yes only if u have a new Ferrari rolls Royce and such,btohqsg
If you trying impress ppl with like a old coe car or some basic modelForget it,btohqsg
Old COE car no problem  sometimes they are better buys than newer cars at the price  but must buy for the car not the flex,btohqsg
actly i get impressed by coe cars.. especially if they renewed 2-3 times already,btohqsg
Respect to those maintaining them well!,btohqsg
the older one pre 2000 still quite possible.. newer ones these days don't age well,btohqsg
too complicated too much things can go wrong,btohqsg
Why not? You like to floor in front of lights. It’s better for you.,btohqsg
i saying i like classic car haha,btohqsg
Those that are renewed multiple times,btohqsg
okay la some not too bad. was looking at a Crown Athlete GRS200. looked like a pretty solid car from 2008,btohqsg

No need go Monte Carlo liao,btohqsg
No lar it’s the brake discs that’s your whole year salary 😅,btohqsg
Morning All. Just need some advice here  to buy 2nd hand parf car  which year's car is more recommended? Thanks,btohqsg
I think more like two years for me sir,btohqsg
Good morning sir  even for wine I can’t answer that question. You might need to be more specific on brand  model or some general guideline for the community here sir.,btohqsg
I reckon 20k with installation here,btohqsg
And not meant for track so you need a spare iron for track days 🤣,btohqsg
"Hmm...usually it's ""which brand of car is recommended?"".You are different. 😁😁",btohqsg
You don't need need iron discs for track days  ceramics can handle the temps better on track for sure. But they recommend iron brakes because they'll degrade slower which means they'll last you for a few more track days than the ceramics and cheaper to replace,btohqsg
Just some A-B car like Honda Vezel (HR-V) or Shuttle.,btohqsg
These are a good choice but tough be sure to do the homework to not get a masked phv and tweaked mileage...,btohqsg
Byd cheaper depreciation around 11 k compare to vezel and save on petrol and bigger,btohqsg
BYD Seal With 517 HP And 650 KM Range For 43 000 USD Launched In Chinahttps://carnewschina.com/2022/05/20/byd-seal-with-517-hp-and-650-km-range-for-43000-usd-launched-in-china/,btohqsg
But maybe not the 517 power 1 haha,btohqsg
Wow but price oso definitely.... 😅,btohqsg
See how much the dealer mark up lol,btohqsg
Byd is really there to fight tesla,btohqsg
But so far byd price is really good,btohqsg
All the other ev and car markets sure got a long way to go to fight this marker,btohqsg
Japan cars got a lot to catch up,btohqsg
Not convinient to charge still right  for EV car,btohqsg
For me Is not hard at all   the benefit is way better,btohqsg
Most of the driver 1 week charge twice   if don’t have dedicated charger or not driving tesla   nowadays got alot of work place   shopping center got charger facility or even petrol kiosk   can just plan 1 week twice to do some errand and charge the car,btohqsg
I checked those 2019 car  the markup is so high though their COE is low.,btohqsg
Ya since this year hehe   cause new car price very high,btohqsg
That why buying like byd save a lot of money as the arf is very low due to ev subsidy compare to ice,btohqsg
Need twice a week? I dun drive but the mileage for a full charge like byd e6 is how long,btohqsg
40 minutes Depent on your state of charge and the charger speed   40 mins is base on dc like 100 kw,btohqsg
Go and test drive lol   most of ppl I know drive an ev liao don’t want go back to ice le,btohqsg
Don’t underestimate the low horse of the byd   acceleration is very smooth,btohqsg
Uh oh I fomo. I think I belong to the minority 😵‍💫😵‍💫,btohqsg
then again what  are you missing out on? enjoy ICE while it lasts,btohqsg
when everyone truly embrace EV then hop onto bandwagon also not too l ate,btohqsg
The chargers are not sufficient at all😅,btohqsg
Exactly.. infrastructure not there how to embrace,btohqsg
Actually now most of the time charge car always got lots cause ev still very little,btohqsg
Most of the malls also got dc charger already,btohqsg
Best cars for young adults in the early stages of their careerYou may drive many cars in your lifetime  but the first car that you paid with your hard-earned money will always hold a special place in your heart🥰💪🏻What was your first ever car?➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
What are your top 5 best first cars for young adults?,btohqsg
byd will fill sg road when Coe drop more for cat A,btohqsg

Only one SUV - Mazda CX-3 in the list? Hr-v or Vezel should be in  i think.,btohqsg
As long they don’t hog the road they are nice,btohqsg
Corolla Altis is not cheap anymore,btohqsg
To be honest  no cars are cheap anymore😪,btohqsg
some will say P-Plate ferrari is the best car,btohqsg
P-Plate ferrari  porsche and maserati all I see before😆,btohqsg
$93k for a brand new one,btohqsg
Alot of p plate are fake 1,btohqsg
My car also is with p plate when I got 12 years driving experience,btohqsg
Which AD cars is cheapest now? I think still jdm right?,btohqsg
With no points deduction for speeding,btohqsg
Attrage still the cheapest on the market,btohqsg
nowadays a lot of the high end cars real p-platers as well,btohqsg
Attrage and space star both $93k,btohqsg
you like people to cut you hor😂😂 ppl see p plate will definitely bully them😂😂,btohqsg
Yes   but a lot are fake 1 also   just put p plate for fun,btohqsg
then they lose money ah.. coe 95k then mitsubishi pay me to buy their car?,btohqsg
Space star looks smaller than attrage,btohqsg
make sense haha.. attrage damn small but decent if only 2 ppl in the car,btohqsg
just the boot missing  space inside is the same. Both quite small,btohqsg
i dont think they can fit tbh,btohqsg
So with a smaller boot  so make attrage more attractive then,btohqsg
but good economical car  thailand got alot😂😂,btohqsg
"depends on choice  some people prefer space star cause no boot poking out so ""easier to park""",btohqsg
If AD will be Seat Ibiza,btohqsg
I see… hatchback is nicer car esp suv evolve from there,btohqsg
No wonder i see some neighbors bought this. Make economical sense,btohqsg
😂No small CCLikeNissan Note 1.2QasQaiMitsubishi AttrageIn the past Picanto is favourite 😂Chevrolet aveo 1.4Hyundai getzCherry QQChevrolet spark👍,btohqsg
Very cheap in Thailand 😂 I think18 000 SGD can get 1,btohqsg

Oh swift. 👍You added honda jazz already,btohqsg
This reminds me of the past that nissan march 1.0 was also one of the younglings first car.,btohqsg
Right…I thought you were naming your own list of best first cars for young adults. My bad!,btohqsg
Back in those days. Got 600cc cars that are also good choice for the younglings starting to get their first cars,btohqsg
cannot . car too cheap Singaporean won't buy . no face.😂. car is a status symbol here😂,btohqsg
Nothing is too cheap. If you are an undergrad with any car also not bad.,btohqsg
"saw a"" Audi ""copen in Sg b4😂😂",btohqsg
Back then it wasnt cheap also?,btohqsg
This car very light.. less than 1 ton.Feel like driving filmsy Daytona Arcade's car😂 metal easy to bent,btohqsg
light good. add turbo can fly,btohqsg
Some copen do bodykit until look very swee,btohqsg
olden day sports cars are small n light,btohqsg
But daihatsu brand was also younglings choice,btohqsg
daihatsu is a subsidiary company of totoya,btohqsg
same same product just diffent brand,btohqsg
kinda . Camry is just a cheaper version of ES,btohqsg
Wah do until put the GTR badge also😆,btohqsg
l880k decent  can get at good price  most are well maintained,btohqsg
this one with the new gen copen in Japan,btohqsg
can tell what the owner like to smoke,btohqsg
It’s a men’s thingy to look at the headlights,btohqsg
the new copen is very different  not just the headlights,btohqsg
Some like to look at the tail lights,btohqsg
Tail lights can tell what car also,btohqsg
Interestingly we don’t get to see many k cars here in little red dot. Closest is toyota bb,btohqsg
We will get there soon😉 There are more articles to come!,btohqsg
Road tax chor sia this one 😂,btohqsg
Well if family can afford  maybe this is just one of the cars,btohqsg
Nothing is holding back the well-to-do to splurge on material things. 😂 i thank them to help contribute to gov coffins.,btohqsg
for me more important is residential areas lah… I don’t even go mall so often these days. But just me lah..,btohqsg
Electric car's road tax more Chor right?,btohqsg
Lol. I think to many is they want the public transport to be near at their door steps. And that all the public transport must be EV’d first.,btohqsg
back to my earlier question  2nd hand A-B parf car  between 3 years old car (i.e. 2019 - lowest COE mostly) and 7 years old (i.e. 2015 another year of high COE)  which one makes better sense?,btohqsg
please dont get these. you will regret. i hjave been in one many years ago. it is not safe. cramp inside and claustrophobic. and tiring to drive long. you will be stressed,btohqsg
u will feel like a dwarf even beside a mini😂,btohqsg
If you looking for a toy car,btohqsg
That's the perfect car to get,btohqsg
Actually not claustrophobic contrary to popular belief,btohqsg
i have. and immeditely i can size it up,btohqsg
Definitely not meant for comfort or long drives  just a fun little car,btohqsg
It feels like in a gokart? 😅,btohqsg
Yes  have driven them as well,btohqsg
there is no safety. in a collison you will get sandwiched,btohqsg
You're definitely low to the ground but you have enough power to go around the expressways and cruise in the middle lane  can make overtakes as well,btohqsg
in japan  they have small cars because they dont drive long distance and many to nearby only. besides  they have a tendency to change cars every 2 or 3 years,btohqsg
Depending on situations. But yes i concur with you,btohqsg
One doesn't buy kei cars for safety  more for the character and fun,btohqsg
And there's many other cars on the road with very poor safety standards  just about what one is comfortable with,btohqsg
if you drive this in small roads alleys type and not on highways yeah ok. but in singapore you will drive this on ECP PIE,btohqsg
Even normal cars doesn’t want to be in a situation of in between large trucks,btohqsg
dont have to be between trucks. in a typical collisons  you will lose,btohqsg
Can drive no problem  just need to make an effort to keep distance and stay out of blindspots. Similar to miatas,btohqsg
So many choose to slow down when approaching beside these big vehicles. Kind of having phobic moments. 😂,btohqsg
Actually to me more prefer to drive big cars. Probably due to this fear of collision,btohqsg
And the reality is many cars are getting larger in size too,btohqsg
No matter how unsafe  still safer than motorbike,btohqsg
Some people are just biased haha... biased towards unreliable conti cars like AR,btohqsg
it is not that. there are situations beyond your control. best is adequate protection. that is why mopads are not allowed on highways,btohqsg
correct! makes you practise defensive driving which is a very good habit,btohqsg
well that's just the risk you could be willing to take 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Defensive driving means always be prepared to stop,btohqsg
Until some like to play jam braking,btohqsg
there's a certain element of risk involved with every car you drive no matter what  just need to be in the right frame of mind and have the relevant skills to manage and get out as safely as possible,btohqsg
point A  to Point B loh  looking at Hr-v (or Vezel) or Shuttle for bigger space,btohqsg
best imo is take leopard tank.. bang ppl also wont die  see road hogger just fire missle lor,btohqsg
aso their highway speed on 90 or 100 like sg. they dun have to make their car heavy n stable like German on autobahn,btohqsg
The Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé Is Now The Most Expensive Car Ever Sold,btohqsg
Ok. Have fun sourcing. Many choices to pick from these models,btohqsg
Rich man’s game. This league is different. The mentality is ownerships or leaving behind a legacy.,btohqsg
And Thier speed limit is higher then us,btohqsg
I think is 100   I think is only sg express way limit is at 90 haha and the lowest of all,btohqsg
I know many sg friends like to chiong msia nsh.,btohqsg
Cause 110Ma and ppl will give way Singapore is 90 but ppl drive 80 and don’t give way,btohqsg
Give what way? Jam brake lah.,btohqsg
between 3 years old car (i.e. 2019 - lowest COEmostly) and 7 years old (i.e. 2015 another year of high COE)  which onemakes better sense?,btohqsg
From business sense  take whichever is the lowest quantum cost.,btohqsg
I enjoy driving in Malaysia too. Feels safer,btohqsg
Buy the7 yrs old one3 yr later scrap. Take parf value and scrap valueprobably COE drop.You can buy EV or many other face lift cars,btohqsg
