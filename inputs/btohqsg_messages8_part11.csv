HLE will expire in 6 months eh,btohqsg
Hi  definitely got chance! I just got called down for a flat selection eventho my ballot number is 83 out of 33 from NOV 2020 Sbf,btohqsg
C quota still 2x more than other races. Quite surprised I still got called down also,btohqsg

Unique layout  can't spot the door for common bedroom  it's linked to MBR,btohqsg
Thx for sharing  definitely positive hopeful vibes!,btohqsg
Got ballot results December last year & only got the message for hdb appointment last week,btohqsg
No urbanville flats for selection for Nov 2020 SBF exercise. Probably upcoming SBF exercise then have I think,btohqsg
Yeah! I even got a ballot number for last May‚Äôs BTO,btohqsg
Hello! I got a inquiry  anybody knows the answer for this ?Let say during 2001 I was a PR when I bought a resale flat   but 2005 I‚Äôm a singaporean alr. So let say if I applied the bto   am I consider first time using hdb loan or second hdb loan?,btohqsg
Limited flats left for selection but hopefully I get the flat that i‚Äôm eyeing onüôèüèº Anws  which estate did u applied for?,btohqsg
This year many bto completing meh?,btohqsg
quite abit. there were many projects delayed from last year,btohqsg
Yes... During your flat selection appointment,btohqsg
Indeed  and hope it goes higher when we going to sell.,btohqsg
Who would ever want it to be low? Surely someone close either self  aged relatives  children will be the one selling and hoping to get a good price.,btohqsg
Thats y for entry into the 'game'  BTO is the answer.,btohqsg
unless u need to house family of 10,btohqsg
Until maxed out benefits  then 'downgrade',btohqsg
Sorry  'right size' is the pc term.,btohqsg
Wait serious? I select the flat in feb 2021 and till now they havent call me to sign the lease. I thought its normal,btohqsg
Ok but now i will call them then,btohqsg
They got backlog ba. Today I saw someone commented that they came back from HDB saying morning the HDB staff rushing to hand over keys for those that suppose to get their keys during covid period.,btohqsg
True just relax ah for now. House also ready 2024.,btohqsg
Don't understand why so many people want to sign the lease ASAP,btohqsg
Once you started to downpayment your house  CPF starts to compute accrued interest,btohqsg
Btw is cpf accrued interest 2.5% or 3.5% if have less than 20k in OA?,btohqsg
I'm referring to cpf accrued interest,btohqsg
I agree. More time to save,btohqsg
oh lol different sites say different thing,btohqsg
Signed the lease in March 2018 till now 39 months passed,btohqsg
if got more than 20k in OA then confirm 2.5%. If less I'm not sure,btohqsg
Not more time to save but earn more interest given by CPF,btohqsg
Which accrued interest are y'all talking about  what's left of the OA  or what's left of the loan,btohqsg
I mean  it's the same amount as the interest accrued by the CPF loan,btohqsg
This is from HLE maCurrent interest rate for an HDB concessionary housing loan. The interest rate will be based on the interest rate for CPF OrdinaryAccount plus 0.1%.3Interest rate may increase  and the monthly contributions to the CPF Ordinary Account will change over time. To minimise interest cost please minimise the loan amount and opt for a shorter repayment period  if possible.,btohqsg
Interest Rate for Ordinary AccountInterest rate from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021: 2.5% per annumThe interest rate is computed based on the 3-month average of major local banks' interest rates1  subject to the legislated minimum interest of 2.5% per annum. The interest rate for OA is reviewed quarterly.,btohqsg
Coz interest for OA is 3.5% for first 20k right? So technically accrued interest should follow same rate,btohqsg
Accrued interest is not loan interest,btohqsg
It's the amt you have to pay back to your cpf when you sell the hse. Doesn't matter whether its bank loan or hdb loan,btohqsg
Wait  it's not running on the same interest rate?,btohqsg
Accumulated $1841 the past 39 months,btohqsg
Nvm I guess if you intend to sell house and by another one  the accrued interest doesn't really matter ba,btohqsg
Unless you want to buy BTO again to make use of the chance,btohqsg
Ya but if you buy another house straightaway. You pay back to OA then immediately take out lor,btohqsg
