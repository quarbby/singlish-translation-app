but they also cannot say it's easy. Because those who didn't do well will feel even more down,btohqsg
i feel like my understanding of h2 phy is solid. but even so i scared of ee1102 (phy for eee). first time that i will be dealing with calculus in phy when everyone in ph1011 would have been through that for an entire sem. plus ph1011 actually go through quite a lot of stuff that h2 phy never cover so i will be behind alr (anyway  didnt take ee1102 in y1s1 cause cannot overload + finals clash),btohqsg
my phd mod the prof say the midterm is quite simple but then half failed and a solid one third got below 25%,btohqsg
I remember my Phy for EE at NUS.Pretty straightforward.,btohqsg

hmm true but i think the content you missed from ph1011 isn‚Äôt too much. like its just building the intuition to translate physics to integrals (so understanding what integration does physically). if you have that idt you‚Äôll have issues,btohqsg
agree  it's the understanding of integration as a summation that will help greatly,btohqsg
