the entry salary is so low ü•π,btohqsg
ok it sounds a bit like how NTU has common engineering,btohqsg
engineering in general is low pay one,btohqsg
honestly i wanted try geological engineering but not a lot of uni have sia,btohqsg
but then again engineering is like solid rice bowl  cannot get full cannot get hungry,btohqsg
if u wan legit get rich den go for finance or computer science,btohqsg
the ntu one is you go in  then after a bit you decide what engineering you want,btohqsg
so sad.. can‚Äôt buy bbt everyday ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
although computer science now abit saturated,btohqsg
but it's subject to your grades and demand,btohqsg
ya la so many ppl want to go in,btohqsg
this one seems to be you go into the bachelor of science then you take credits that go into whatever path you want from the list,btohqsg
is like the biomed in early 2000s,btohqsg
i jus choose mec eng coz ik wont starve one,btohqsg
the Australia one is like a cross between that and the US,btohqsg
US is fr decide any major at all but this one is like you have options within the subgroup,btohqsg
for mine is about 14% girls,btohqsg
i think the only course in SIT eng with such high numbers lol,btohqsg
i mean if you know what engineering you wanna do it'd be better to go for it directly bc like i said  going from common engineering is dependent on your sem 1 grades,btohqsg
and the demand of the one you want,btohqsg
ukw atp if i get into any ntu course i‚Äôll just eat it up,btohqsg
go finance if u wan earn big bucks,btohqsg
but my grades might not be good,btohqsg
and i‚Äôm not sg a level,btohqsg
worry about that after getting your results,btohqsg
if they even look at my application i think ill be v happy alr,btohqsg
i mean i did sg a levels v badly so see how ba,btohqsg
my best results came from PSLE and then uni,btohqsg
what was ur results if udm me asking ü•π,btohqsg
Chem: DPhysics: AMath: EGP: BPW: AGeog: D,btohqsg
how tf is that bad üòî,btohqsg
oh no atp maybe no ntu fr me anm,btohqsg
need to start being ok w koalas and spiders ..,btohqsg
how is that not bad ...,btohqsg
my best subjects came from H1,btohqsg
my course in ntu is low cutoff that's why plus,btohqsg
p sure it's still luck that i made it looking at the IGP,btohqsg
i took a test to get in btw,btohqsg
like they called me to come in for it,btohqsg
omg i bet u studied ur ass off,btohqsg
how did u get resources to study for the tests?,btohqsg
not rlly like the test was mainly O level stuff + math capabilities,btohqsg
i also v naughty during a level,btohqsg
now i wake up alr too late üôÇ,btohqsg
i can't vibe with the jc structure,btohqsg
i look at like h2 chem now and if i had half the intuition i had now,btohqsg
maybe js need to bear w consequences and retake again,btohqsg
make sure this time all A,btohqsg
by that logic we r fked no?,btohqsg
bruh i regret ‚ò†Ô∏è why was i so naughty during jc,btohqsg
