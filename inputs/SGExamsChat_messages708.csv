if I say I’m Christian on Reddit I get downvoted,btohqsg
but if someone says hail Satan hooray,btohqsg
oo dhs is ur fav sch?,btohqsg
I told my teacher in p6 I wanted to go to NA,btohqsg
such a bias app for news as well,btohqsg
she asked everyone what is target score iirc,btohqsg
i used to think i must be the best at everything but rn i feel like getting what is enough to get me where i want to go is okay too,btohqsg
then I said enough for NA,btohqsg
"""reach for the celling  not the stars""",btohqsg
i mean i literally didn't study at all for psle,btohqsg
like for example i used to want 4.0 gpa in y4 (which i clearly didnt get) but later on i was okay that i did well enough to promote and do 4h2,btohqsg
Who wants 2 dollar worth of mutton,btohqsg
i didnt until the last minute,btohqsg
reach for the stars but not everyone can hit them so its okay even if you just hit the ceiling,btohqsg
my psle was spent watching TV,btohqsg
my parents were surprisingly ok with it,btohqsg
high 5 but i was watching twice and BTS videos,btohqsg
they knew i wouldn't get too bad of results,btohqsg
Cuz for me  getting to a better school than my classmates were,btohqsg
like they were estimating 220-240 range,btohqsg
my mom was scolding me for watching kpop stuff during psle period,btohqsg
Pretty damn impt at that time,btohqsg
I was watching Roblox or smth,btohqsg
All schs arts hv a higher pr equal cop,btohqsg
what matters is progress not results,btohqsg
i literally sat on my mom's bed and read some science book while watching tv with her,btohqsg
my parents made a deal where for every A I got I have money,btohqsg
my first time studying proper that's not just last min flip notes,btohqsg
Yes for 2024 admissions and most years,btohqsg
funny thing is my mom was disappointed after i got my results,btohqsg
I think the arts chers are better than the sci chers tho💀💀But it is harder to score well in arts during sch exam than sci for sure,btohqsg
Ok la maybe it's just a my pov thing💀,btohqsg
ur mom more elitist than my friends ah,btohqsg
Cuz nvr get A* for maths,btohqsg
1. i think she was expecting >2702. top scorer got 265 and i was the cohort topper for 5 years straight so his mom was cheering like siaolang after they announced he topped the sch for psle  but i literally dgaf lol,btohqsg
on PSLE day I was happy,btohqsg
My mom was so angry abt me crying that she scold me lol,btohqsg
wtf dude ur score can literally go nygh and rgs what is your mom on,btohqsg
end of the day progress can alr,btohqsg
then the other people parents were asking my mom ‘ eh how much your son get’,btohqsg
my mom was the reason i didn't go hci or ri lmao,btohqsg
I handled O lvl results way btr tho,btohqsg
what did she say abt those schools,btohqsg
you're still paying 100+ compared to government sch,btohqsg
ik someone in my class got like 230,btohqsg
wonder why indep schools are so expensive though,btohqsg
also did i tell yall the story of the tuition teacher principal convincing my mom to send me to cchm ? i think i mentioned before briefly but not in detail,btohqsg
no la just the price really when we could go dhs that's good also and cheaper,btohqsg
but i would've told me then to fight to go ri or hci,btohqsg
bc the opportunities they give you,btohqsg
it's worth the fees if you can take advantage of it,btohqsg
you wouldn't have met your first love fcp then :/,btohqsg
at least they don't announce the lowest score in the cohort anymore,btohqsg
not who but just the lowest score,btohqsg
it used to be literally printed on your result slip,btohqsg
but i heard other countries are way more elitist,btohqsg
and sg is actually already a lot better...,btohqsg
showed this before but this is my year,btohqsg
think they stopped after my year,btohqsg
not sure what the point of stating the lowest even was,btohqsg
is 257 considered high or low,btohqsg
anything above 230 is high imo,btohqsg
did bro just go into the exam and sleep,btohqsg
wah i didnt know they showed  my yr they got say but not on the cert...,btohqsg
mine was the last year they did,btohqsg
usually when is cca step down,btohqsg
late march/early april or late april?,btohqsg
sian of my cca liao lol,btohqsg
mine was july but my sch may be diff cause no o levels,btohqsg
usually is after wtv competition stuff your cca has,btohqsg
i still went for comp in august though,btohqsg
mine nsg ended in like feb,btohqsg
my cher said step down in april,btohqsg
it is usually end april - may (when syf / nsg end),btohqsg
not sure about the other ccas,btohqsg
step down is usually end april - may ish,btohqsg
My cca last day for j2 is 20 may,btohqsg
oh ps i tot she was referring to O lvls,btohqsg
JC my cca step down was in May,btohqsg
I don't even rmb my sec sch cca step down,btohqsg
i was lucky to step down earlier coz my cca syf was the earlier schools,btohqsg
so i think i stepped down 27April,btohqsg
Wiped memories of sec sch cca out sia,btohqsg
a continuation of an earlier topic,btohqsg
i looked at psle math and i realised it was a whole another world of difference,btohqsg
i watched this youtuber jordan chua do the math papers,btohqsg
n then i paused to look at some of the qns n tried to mental sum it in my brain,btohqsg
n then like i was like wow wait this is kinda hard,btohqsg
I do more mental gymnastics for psle math than nanhua prelim amath paper..,btohqsg
bro it has unknowingly gotten harder despite teachers saying it's getting easier,btohqsg
It's more like what psle test compared to,btohqsg
I feel like emath harder than a math,btohqsg
cause a math all the qns repeated one,btohqsg
But emath idk why cambridge suddenly become super creative with the qns,btohqsg
Iirc this year is 7 for sci 8 for arts,btohqsg
anyone know last year nus rc application acceptance rates?,btohqsg
my sch team chapalang one  first round out alrdy,btohqsg
tho i even more chapalang so i cant say much,btohqsg
Also 3 ppl called bunny cute today 😎,btohqsg
i rmb like 2-3 years ago they got put the stats on their web but cant seem to find anym i think they remove,btohqsg
curious  do yall read the news,btohqsg
also i see the memorials part,btohqsg
just in case someone ik died,btohqsg
Why would they necessarily put on newspaper,btohqsg
because some people may wanna attend people funeral,btohqsg
For mine is my family ask me cut out the pic and put on the wall,btohqsg
Newspapers are bought to lay out on the floor  so can do spray painting without dirtying the floor,btohqsg
i used to read during holiday then got lazy,btohqsg
straits times kinda ex if dont share,btohqsg
the paper size is so large,btohqsg
OMG when i was in pri sch i was like rejecting my parents telling me to read the news,btohqsg
now im like loving that shit lol,btohqsg
so ig i can tell that im getting mature mentally,btohqsg
guess sec sch still dh  need wait until jc maybe?,btohqsg
bobian ig  less and less ppl buying so need increase price,btohqsg
btw what school are you from? you seem to frequent this place but i dont know which school you are in. care to share?,btohqsg
I think I might be getting obsessed about some current affairs stuff and like I would keep on checking for updates on certain topics very often,btohqsg
But sometimes the news can be quite negative,btohqsg
idk i dont bother i just read the free version LOL,btohqsg
oo what course? if u dont want to share its alr,btohqsg
Yeah I try to force myself to read from sources I don’t like,btohqsg
I judge for myself what is bs and what are good points,btohqsg
I mean it may actually be a good thing so long as you remain discerning,btohqsg
Sometimes you need to see viewpoints that are not rly aligned with yours,btohqsg
I rmbr Manu Bhaskaran (some famous economist) during an ESS talk said he forces himself to do that,btohqsg
ive never heard of a course like that,btohqsg
Like he hates stuff published by NYT but still reads their stuff frequently,btohqsg
does ite have some very unique courses or something,btohqsg
i heard they have courses that poly and uni dont offer,btohqsg
hope ure finding ur course fun :),btohqsg
why yall keep talking about kurt tay ah,btohqsg
i heard ite has the hairdressing course that polys dont have?,btohqsg
so it would be so fun for people who love working at salons,btohqsg
sum of my past barbers need go thr fr,btohqsg
i also abit interested in haircare and hairstyling,btohqsg
r yall very into haircuts and stuff  like those 50$ haircuts or wtv,btohqsg
ngl i think itd be fun if uni have some mods like cooking mod  hairstyling mod then can learn fun stuff,btohqsg
eh i usually go to my moms friend for haircut cause my mom makes me go there,btohqsg
the only good thing yall have in ite is those cool asf courses,btohqsg
i find doing hairstyles therapeutic for me,btohqsg
what other unique courses do they have ah,btohqsg
i have no idea wat haircut suits me,btohqsg
"okay so for most ppl on reddit their main ""problem"" in j1 is adapting to academic rigour or like no friendsfor me  my ""main problem"" is a little different 😬😬",btohqsg
just get the usual cut shorter pretty much,btohqsg
i like the wolf haircut?? (what is it called again HAHA),btohqsg
i have a weirdly shapped skull so wld rather not,btohqsg
so for me my problem is someone i have a history with (not romantic rs) is in my class 💀💀,btohqsg
is econs essay like o level geog essay,btohqsg
dw elaborate too much but the thing is for some reason  the day i found out he was in my class i unblocked him and i felt like i wasnt as mad anymore,btohqsg
i will cross the bridge when it comes to it,btohqsg
he mustve done something bad to you to make you feel this way,btohqsg
or however the saying goes idfk,btohqsg
Not gonna go into details cause theres 2k ppl in this chat... But to kinda give you a rough idea  discipline master knows what happened between us,btohqsg
does he have the bank account of elon musk,btohqsg
did what he did to you cause ur grades to take a dip? since it sounds so bad that the discipline master knows about it,btohqsg
i feel very bad for you now 😭😭,btohqsg
Eh idw say too much  lets just keep it at what he did affected me very badly,btohqsg
it's ok i was quite famous in dhs back then,btohqsg
hows the school culture like? fun?,btohqsg
Is it because fcp had a crush on you?,btohqsg
Or the other way around 🤔🤔,btohqsg
i also dw say too much but,btohqsg
i've talked to dr foo in his office before,btohqsg
But yea you said here before fcp made your dhs life a bit 💀💀,btohqsg
It legit depends on who you are and the ppl you mix with,btohqsg
i hv no brain for this,btohqsg
luckily for me it was my parents dealing with the principal...BUT end up i was known to both vp and p lol,btohqsg
if you need help with understanding anything just lmk,btohqsg
in primary school i got scolded by the principal coz my stomach always pain then she always see me in the GO,btohqsg
no mine was coz my mum was having a long ass complaining session but end up they didnt do anything but i think my pw tutor was kick out of the pw com coz of me lol,btohqsg
My mini flex is that i shook hands with current dhs principal twice,btohqsg
and actually my mum insisted he made a report to MOE for us coz of the missing team member coz she said what if our team is marked a s ateam of 5,btohqsg
i shook hand with vp thrice and cac chairman once,btohqsg
oh i forgot about that one time where i shook hands with the principal,btohqsg
i oni shook hands with principal once,btohqsg
but luckily my award ceremonies mostly vp and not thatugly lookingprincipal,btohqsg
for like ApLm thing at RP lolll,btohqsg
im short alr but when i look at the past photos  i realised i ard same height as the vp lol,btohqsg
they are always out to whack,btohqsg
but tbh my dm was my physics tutor for 2 weeks and he damn nice to me,btohqsg
now my dms seem quite chill,btohqsg

"even the guy go ""shee shee"" in class no caning",btohqsg
OHHH ya r is from hc,btohqsg
Bruh no way someone shush a person in class,btohqsg
so i confuse why matcha from dhs ip say oso from hc,btohqsg
My tablemate did it to me before,btohqsg
Yes not only class  seen cohort as well,btohqsg
our class should do this with cyy/j,btohqsg
why i prefer the jh skirt,btohqsg
I can barely tell the diff,btohqsg
i havent took any full body pics of me in sh skirt so this is the best comparison i can find@eggvoki,btohqsg
Bruh  this is like telling someone that their sleeve is shorter than their elbow,btohqsg
wait nvm i should find other pics those are bad pics,btohqsg
Do y’all wear shirts that cover your elbows?,btohqsg
if the person in charge of making ur class tee fook up can got spelling error for all the shirts,btohqsg
shldnt that person pay up for new ones?,btohqsg
When was this?? My classmate in primary school pee in class also,btohqsg
Messes w family finance too much to make them redo,btohqsg
pic taken from online so am not doxxing anyone,btohqsg
our class is called 4 Responsibility he spell resposibility or smth,btohqsg
Also in the sh skirt when i sit down it doesnt fully cover my knees,btohqsg
Meh it's not even that obv,btohqsg
his in FAS but he got macbook iphone everything lol,btohqsg
also got 1 or 2 names lol,btohqsg
Ya coz she thinks i lying..,btohqsg
Not like school become “shoe” ok alr,btohqsg
ig  but i just dont like the guy anyways,btohqsg
My friends name got misspelt on class shirt also lol,btohqsg
Ffs I could not look at that class’s for the whole damn day  without laughing on cue,btohqsg
my sec sch didn't even allow us to wear class shirt unless it's grad bruh so,btohqsg
I altered it that way lol…no one has skirts that cover until the knee tho,btohqsg
Mine got cuz I nvr alter 💀,btohqsg
My sec sch is either uni or pe,btohqsg
But tbh once I learn how to use sewing machine gonna go and alter my skirts alrd💀,btohqsg
I see everyone else the skirt so short dw be exception,btohqsg
You know when schools always ask students to not wear knee length skirts or ankle length socks…but the skirts and socks they provide are knee and ankle length 💀,btohqsg
Ain’t that called a sewing machine,btohqsg
No my mum use the needle,btohqsg
I also know how to do but,btohqsg
This is my enemy…i back pain sia when i use it during fce,btohqsg
Eh those hand sewn pebbles in a bag tho,btohqsg
Felt like all the disc in my school just completely left after we came back from covid,btohqsg
You will see people wearing pe shirts+ school pants on a daily,btohqsg
since when the skirt so short,btohqsg
The worse one I’ve seen is school shirt with basketball pants…like what’s the point,btohqsg
it's a diff kind of skirt from ri lol,btohqsg
those would look damn weird if below the knee,btohqsg
I only wear for like Monday,btohqsg
Good until you see the uniform cover like a oversized tee,btohqsg
Each to their own I guess but from afar…looks like he is wearing nothing but a shirt,btohqsg
Is it he wear very short,btohqsg
idk why guys like to wear very short shorts nowadays,btohqsg
Butt perked up kind of short,btohqsg
the dhs jh one is more like ri one so it looks ok below the knee but the sh one is meant to be slightly above the knee,btohqsg
ohhh those type damn funny what no meh,btohqsg
Literally would think he was wearing boxers until you see the big ass school name,btohqsg
flexing the gyat I don’t hv,btohqsg
I deleted my pic cause it was a bad representation,btohqsg
Fun times man my sec school was fun,btohqsg
eh ill bring it up when sch reopens,btohqsg
Hey my school tho 3.9 GodAmn,btohqsg
the pleats are diff. you see the sh one the folds only goes halfway up the skirt,btohqsg
uh i would say  get the class to decide  i do agree it’s unfair but like class unity.. id feel bad for the person,btohqsg
My mom said the skirt was too short but then if i got a bigger size it would look v weird on me,btohqsg
partly bc of the folds  the sh one has a tighter cutting like if it's too long it can actually get q annoying to walk. and it just looks a lot more auntie if long compared to jh,btohqsg
a lot of jcs use this kind of skirt,btohqsg
oh i despise the person  most of the class oso dont rly like him anyways,btohqsg
ri is more like all the sec sch kind,btohqsg
ri is more the exception here,btohqsg
Then how did he become the one to get the shirt printed,btohqsg
he and his frens organise ig,btohqsg
aiya but still.. it’s money ah  whether rich or poor i think it’s only fair maybe the class pay half the amount for the second shirt instead of full?,btohqsg
1 person design  1 person contact the maunfactorer and he was the one to type into the template for the shirts,btohqsg
I feel it would had been gud,btohqsg
he himself say his fault ig,btohqsg
what’s been done is done so,btohqsg
im pretty sure he feels bad  maybe take my suggestion propose to your class?,btohqsg
Xinmin just missing another “m” to become xmm,btohqsg
ye they got send for the preliminary ones but idk why final submission like nameing and sizing nvr send to grp chat,btohqsg

I rock my class tee over cca shirt any day tho,btohqsg
My sis complaining similar things sia,btohqsg
the only good tees i've seen are the 20th anniversary and the festival shirt last year,btohqsg

only my cca shirt was free,btohqsg
Bruh ppl selling rp jackets for like $50+,btohqsg

So yes those ppl selling have a high demand market,btohqsg
my upper sec class had a class jacket,btohqsg

overtly sexual chem teacher for no reason,btohqsg
Isn’t that like punishable or smth?,btohqsg
Like who tf asks that  let alone a sch cher,btohqsg
the statements made were not targeted at individuals..that could be a reason it slid off the radar,btohqsg
yes  but what can you do..just go through lessons and tarhan all the cringy attempts lorh,btohqsg
we could not even get a teacher that literally did nothing..not even give us work to do...used his phone the whole 1hrs of lesson time..even one time  the principal walked in saw him using his phone and doing jackshit...to leave our class...whatmore you think that report will do anything to her,btohqsg
"then my class complained straight to principal..even sighted his own eyes as evidence that very instance he saw the lazy ass teacher...in the end what we got? a assembly breifing the next day on ""how to do self revision""",btohqsg
if you look up reviews of my school..almost every review mention teachers being the main problem,btohqsg
