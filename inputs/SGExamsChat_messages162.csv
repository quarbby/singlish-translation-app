It was the third time when i did the paper i felt fear,btohqsg
Meh difficulty but kind of o-level like,btohqsg
What about putting everyone's results up for everyone to see  in the entire school?,btohqsg
He prob referrin to the A lvl students,btohqsg
I thgt marklists were bad enough,btohqsg
The teacher must be a bastard,btohqsg
It's the entire school's for all subjects,btohqsg
At the time it was the thing to do. So it's not suprising. I'm probably older than you...,btohqsg
Fuhua real world context is standard reduction qn,btohqsg
Yes  finished a number of years back,btohqsg
Those people who scored lower would be marginalised ah,btohqsg
I don't dare to open the link,btohqsg
Later haunt me in my sleep,btohqsg
So what happened was that I lived overseas but was on a leave of absence scheme in a singapore primary school. My marks were recorded as 0 for all  hahahaha,btohqsg
Because I didn't take any exams,btohqsg
Anyway it is just not right to show people's result,btohqsg
No matter how smart the class is,btohqsg
I see the databased q i lazy read,btohqsg
I dont even need a ranking to know im among the lowest,btohqsg
And didn't do shit for like 4 days,btohqsg
Your em shld be quite good,btohqsg
I just want to get 80 and abv,btohqsg
Nah i got a borderline A2,btohqsg
Paper 1 56/80 was a fucking killjoy,btohqsg
So must aim like 80 more,btohqsg
I do tys get 80+ not a prob,btohqsg
Luckily you never get scolded in school in front of the class. That is pouring oil on the fire.Some teachers that I had a long time ago would take time to emphasise the best and the worst in the class. It's really sad.,btohqsg
She (head of am em poa) told me that their kids very zai in math and they finished their o lvl paper like 1 hr earlier for each p1 and p2. So like they would calculate and tell their mum which is my em teacher,btohqsg
My em teacher marked their work,btohqsg
One overall got 92 and another was 89,btohqsg
92 was A1 89 was A2,btohqsg
Wah that fucker shld legit die,btohqsg
There is a person like me 7 - 6 = 13,btohqsg
Calculate and write down the first 6 sf but wrote down the entire thing,btohqsg
Now back to practical revision HAHAHHA,btohqsg
I woke up at 12pm 😂,btohqsg
wtf HAHAHAHA i wake up at 7,btohqsg
I did it with 3 frens before,btohqsg
89 is legit A2>91 is A1,btohqsg
So is 90 and above is A1,btohqsg
I got 95 overall emMy fren got 89Another got 85,btohqsg
89 and 85 person were Aw,btohqsg
If A1 was 80 everyone get liao loh,btohqsg
How u know u got 95😂,btohqsg
By the time come out of exam hall answers online le,btohqsg
From 55 for em prelim to 95 o lvl em,btohqsg
I mean i also tot nonsense,btohqsg
But i rmb start of year sec 4,btohqsg
Some math subject head said >91 is A1,btohqsg
So we noted down our overall scores,btohqsg
For am A1 is abt 80,btohqsg
The moderation grade boundaries similar to uk o level maths,btohqsg
Pure chem ard 75 plus A1,btohqsg
More for english the next day tho lol,btohqsg
Thats why if u all dont get the grade u all want for o lvl,btohqsg
Usually borderline 70 to 75 got chance for A alr,btohqsg
But thing is i want to go to business,btohqsg
So i need to count it,btohqsg
Pls let passing marks be 40 or 45,btohqsg
I am a fking botak why tf am i not praying,btohqsg
Is usually abt 45 for C6,btohqsg
Idw take english course in poly,btohqsg
I mean i got a legit c5 in prelims but,btohqsg
I mean definitely for sure c6 is less than 50% of overall score one,btohqsg
Then u want china studies ah/s,btohqsg
Past present participle i now then understand,btohqsg
The passing grade cfm is also less than 50% overall,btohqsg
Like see is present tense saw is past tense seen is participle tense,btohqsg
Tbh what do we need that for,btohqsg
I spent time learning this and then threw it all away. As long as you can write proper sentences you'll be fine. Unless you want to do a degree in linguistics or something,btohqsg
Like had have has are verbs,btohqsg
Then need to have a tense,btohqsg
Bedok teach me how to be smart,btohqsg
I learnt sth in south china video in yt,btohqsg
There is this china boy 'scooping' information from the book and 'pouring' onto his head,btohqsg
I have a friend and former classmate who can tell you  a particular topic is found on which paragraph on which page of the textbook. Very clever. Graduated with first class honours in university.,btohqsg
No  O levels equivalent Biology textbook,btohqsg
Wah i actually damn curious abt your age,btohqsg
If i wanna enter NUS med  i need to have h2 Bio in jc right? Or is phy also ok?,btohqsg
I don't know about uni textbook  but I won't be suprised,btohqsg
Because my chem teacher is a bio nerd,btohqsg
And he same jc with desmond tan,btohqsg
Oh so h2 phy and h2 chem also can still go nus med ah,btohqsg
Thing is  I skipped a year overseas (entered primary school one year early) So I am actually almost one year younger than him.After JC I also dropped out of one university so I wasted a lot of time. Plus I had to wait almost six months to start JC as I finished my secondary 4 equivalent in the middle of the year. Then wait again for university,btohqsg
Oh ok. My bro in sec 2 now and he choosing subj tomorrow. He wanna enter NUS med .He say he can do both phy and bio. But his sch only offers double pure. So shld he take phy or bio. I personally took pure phy and i think is easier then bio as my friends tell me bio more content heavy. Which subj shld my brother take?,btohqsg
U need to do extremely well for A lvls  be multi-talented  or have looks comparable to angelina jolie/brad pitt,btohqsg
He need finish sec sch  go jc,btohqsg
Ask your bro take combi sci,btohqsg
see what subjects he need to enter lor,btohqsg
Pure sci half the thing fake,btohqsg
I was given the decision to serve or not to serve  subject to the board's approval. So even if I said I wanted to serve they can still reject and say exempted.,btohqsg
The bio knowledge in O level and A level will help him in med sch,btohqsg
u see what subs that's needed  take that  then the rest just take wtv is easiest,btohqsg
Wah that is damn good sia,btohqsg
I saw one of my friend's stuff in nus med,btohqsg
They say they dn u to take H2 bio to go med sch,btohqsg
Ohh so better to take bio,btohqsg
But trust me  the first year if u physics student they will force u learn all the o level and a level stuff,btohqsg
He is literally trying to memorise 100 different types of muscles in the hand alone,btohqsg
And that is not even the whole body yet,btohqsg
o/a level is just to bring you to next level. applicability of such knowledge doesn't matter,btohqsg
Well  I am still battling depression and a whole lot of other medical conditions  so it isn't ideal as well,btohqsg
When I did a research with my prof  he's a med sch teacher  the things he teach   only if u bio student den u can understand,btohqsg
I don't see how physics student can understand them,btohqsg
Unless they also learn bio themself,btohqsg
Like reaction wise it is true but pure sci and combi sci like only a little difference,btohqsg
Yea thats what i was wondering as well.,btohqsg
Ask ur bro to pick the subject he love  not which subject easier to score well,btohqsg
Also  I think it's way too early for him to decide Med sch now,btohqsg
Oh okk sure. Thanks for the advice.,btohqsg
He haven't expose himself to the other stuff out there,btohqsg
It's okay man  things gonna get better,btohqsg
ya lol sekali suddenly want be accountant,btohqsg
I thot jc can accept combi sci,btohqsg
I also wanted to go med sch in sec 3 cos my bio pretty good  but now when I'm in JC  I have some research internship and now not sure if research or med or veterinary medicine,btohqsg
depends on sch ah.usually combined science need like b3+pure science pass can liao,btohqsg
JC to take H2 science need minimum B3 for combine ecience,btohqsg
Ohh ok. I heard getting admission into nus med damn tough.,btohqsg
some require u to take bridging lesson,btohqsg
Yes  to enter NTU need take BMAT also,btohqsg
Is ur bro getting straight A1?,btohqsg
Den I think his study should be ok to survive o level   but a level I not sure,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm much better now  but of course life still isn't easy. But I contemplated suicide in the past and there were a lot of other things that happened. Not in MINDEF's interest to let me serve.,btohqsg
Med sch like popular choice ah,btohqsg
But the med sch doesn't just want good grades also,btohqsg
Oh ok. Maybe i ask him reconsider being fixated on med,btohqsg
Ask him to expose himself to more things  attend conference  workshops etc,btohqsg
Yep  don't lock himself on only one choice at such a young age,btohqsg
Just message in this grp we will be thr,btohqsg
because med school is for the very best,btohqsg
but also good to have something to fall back to,btohqsg
Also does he have strong reason to study meds  cos there's mandatory interview,btohqsg
Yea true. Most like something in the it field coz thats the other thing he occasionally brings up.,btohqsg
Bedok or me is ur better friend,btohqsg
it and med v different sia,btohqsg
Idk he just interested in bio and wants to become a doctor in the future haha,btohqsg
