Hi Honey Money community  question! I understand Grabpay has an option where your points can be converted to Krisflyer points.I just want to know  what is better here? Use Krisflyer credit card or Grab Pay? Which gives you most points for miles? Is the difference a lot?,btohqsg
Maybank Friends and Family 8% for all including subcription entertainment,btohqsg
The best miles card are not miles card  but rewards card like DBS WWMC  Citi Rewards and hsbc revo. Check my video on that,btohqsg
Power! But cause I am using UOB Absolute now  Grabpay seems like the only way for me to earn miles with SQ. Do you think itâ€™s comparable to those you showed on YouTube?,btohqsg
I think if you want to earn miles  need to have a good spending power consistently. To me that number is above $1000 to be meaningful miles accumulation. Because Krisflyer miles will expire in 3 years,btohqsg
Youâ€™ve got a point  but my GrabPay points doesnâ€™t expire. I can hold it in my card till I am ready to convert to miles as well right? ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Any referral codes for after Jan 1st?,btohqsg
Grabpay conversion to miles is just poor value  would not recommend,btohqsg
Hsbc revo has 3 year expiry for points then plus 3 years in krisflyer  should be good enough,btohqsg
Hello  are there any thoughts on whether to go for CitiPM or CitiRewards/HSBC Revolution? Understand that CitiPM miles never expire unlike Citi/HSBC Reward points (with expiry of 5 years/37 months respectively)  but also that the Citi Rewards/HSBC Revolution has a higher earn rate of 4mpd (compared to 1.2 for CitiPM).,btohqsg
always go for 4mpd when you have consistent spending. 1.2mpd will take you ages.,btohqsg
i see  thanks Chris! Would there be any situations where youâ€™d recommend using CitiPM? Also  wanted to know if itâ€™s possible to stack Amaze cash back with CitiPM or any other cards  to get cashback/rewards on both Amaze and the underlying credit card?,btohqsg
Dont think so  i havent touch the card for 3 years,btohqsg
Amaze can stack with any singapore mastercard credit card,btohqsg
Hahaha okay I see  thanks for this Chris ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Based on what I saw:125 KF miles = $1500 grabpoints = $1Grab points convert to KF miles20000 points -> 2000 milesItâ€™s like $40 -> $16Do correct me if Iâ€™m wrong,btohqsg
Anyone applied credit card through moneysmart before?,btohqsg
Long long time ago  but now I just apply with Singsaver via Honey Money SG's link,btohqsg
I did with it for my AMEX and Citi cards,btohqsg
This is just a discussion next us fed will rise interest rate and stop printing money and collecting back money. Should we withholding back the s &p 500 fund and invest again when the price is low. What's every one view on this?,btohqsg
You mean cash on advance from credit card?,btohqsg
How do u withdraw from cc,btohqsg
When you withdraw cash from a credit card  it is a cash advance,btohqsg
How do you deposit into cc?,btohqsg
Some cards offsets the cashback automatically in the next bill while some accumulates until you tell the bank to offset,btohqsg
Withdrawing from credit card will have a charge,btohqsg
Why dont you just spend and pay when bill comes? Instead of prepaying 50k (not sure if that is even possible),btohqsg
10k bill  you will only pay 9.7k to amex,btohqsg
you close the account amex will just absorb back the cashback,btohqsg
for TCB they offset the cashback in the same transection month,btohqsg
so it will disappear at the statement date,btohqsg
offsetting the bill is the same as getting the money in your pocket,btohqsg
there are no categories on TCB,btohqsg
its 1.5% on all eligible spends,btohqsg
no the cashback stays in the card,btohqsg
It will off set your bill at the end of the month so you pay lesser to AMEX,btohqsg
3% is only for a limited time,btohqsg
will revert back to 1.5% after,btohqsg
Unless you are already spending the 10k  go ahead.If not  dont bother. Not worth the $300,btohqsg
hi guys  anyone knows any credit card that counted funds transfer to other banks as spending. for eg monthly transfer of money to dbs and ocbc using credit card.,btohqsg
