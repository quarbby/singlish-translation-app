You can always tell which malls have a don don donki simply by its sound.. it echos off the walls seemingly transient of any laws of physics floating ethereally into one's ear akin to a new parasite whom has found its new host creating a symbiotic relationship in every new host it infects,btohqsg

Until you actually get deployed lol,btohqsg
It was a euphemism for the lack of freedom one surrenders in NS,btohqsg

I mean i was making a point on how citizenship also makes a difference in clearance level,btohqsg
But tbh singapore doesn't have much secrets to keep as well,btohqsg
Compared to the US where TS/SCI clearance is valuable in the private sector,btohqsg
If it was that important it would just be sent for disk recovery,btohqsg

This is RP's standard for mathematics..Our maths exams are online,btohqsg
For (ii) we use this special symbol ‚àö,btohqsg
So that's what rp stands for,btohqsg
but its done through a online platform,btohqsg
My as well the cher print for yall the quiz paper then yall do pen paper sia,btohqsg
no written notes allowed during exams  only online notes,btohqsg
whats the point of lockdown browser and the quiz in lms,btohqsg
nvm ah diff sch diff ways,btohqsg
open ended qns are always harder,btohqsg
yea...so notes dont help with anything unless your memory damn cui,btohqsg
the reason is because the lecturer dont mark,btohqsg
the marking is done automatically by a system,btohqsg
there is no method mark...most of the qns just wants the final answer  because of that its also mostly 1 mark each qns,btohqsg
like its all just a single boxed answer..even tells you dont need working,btohqsg
Is there like a national exam,btohqsg
Wow  so they are not tested on a universal standard?,btohqsg
poly is not a national exam,btohqsg
random thought  but is teenage racism increasing in sg,btohqsg
for me its targeting a person to give remarks on their background randomly,btohqsg
you thought he was saying ‚Äúranked points‚Äù  the jc grading system ah,btohqsg
tf they arethatlazy? oh my god,btohqsg
i mean like i feel like the will power of a youngster is being shown way more than lets say one who is a boomer,btohqsg
"In schools like ""oh you nt""",btohqsg
like the people who actually think before they act is dropping to new lows increasing or is it just the media,btohqsg
bro i had a programming lecturer who taught so fast and just said shit to the point most of my classmates were complaining about it  worst thing is he marks everybody present despite some students being latei had to complain to module chair for something to finally changeugh,btohqsg
everybody seem to just be trigger happy,btohqsg
don't even think he teaches properly,btohqsg
Btw how hard is it to get a1 for lit,btohqsg
actually the lecturers dont need to be there if im being honest,btohqsg
so i didn't even know what was going on until i read the slides,btohqsg
we got slides..that goes through step by step on every lesson's deliverables,btohqsg
ONE OF MY LECTURERS IS LIKE THAT,btohqsg
I got one lecturer that did that,btohqsg
‚Äúgo google got answers online bro‚Äù,btohqsg
Oh yea why does everyone hate lit,btohqsg
"then proceeded to boast saying ""Think about why i only work 2 days in a week""",btohqsg
And how hard is a1 for lit,btohqsg
i don't think everyone hates itjust that lots of people probably don't have interest in a subject that requires interpreting poetry,btohqsg
I'm taking pure lit rn 10/10 wouldn't do it in jc,btohqsg
the only good thing bout rp is most of the time once you find the right person...the change happens quick,btohqsg
and if you don'tcan go and commit suicide,btohqsg
my secondary school teachers actually teaches welland cares about our gradesthat's why I preferred my sec sch teachers,btohqsg
Why is she paid at this point,btohqsg
That momment you realise  alot of rp lecturers are part timers,btohqsg
Why do yall go to poly though,btohqsg
cause i rather have a diploma than end at a O levels cert,btohqsg
yeah my critical thinking lecturer did mention about the luggage bag thing,btohqsg
my parents dont even put expectation on me,btohqsg
like if the lecturer carries a luggage bag then is full timer,btohqsg
Isn't like poly lower standing than a level just pass,btohqsg
A levels cert wont bring you anywhere in most industries,btohqsg
If you finish JC and fail to get in a uni...you wasted 2 yrs,btohqsg
a level certificate can't give you a jobonly a diploma can,btohqsg
Can't imagine it sounds so impossible lol,btohqsg
the caveat here is the type of jobs...A levels cert put someone at a higher stance to get a govt job over poly diploma,btohqsg
And possible at the same time,btohqsg
the govt wants A levels peeps,btohqsg
people on reddit were saying that jc students have more priority than poly students when it comes to uni admissions,btohqsg
its very hard to work for the govt using a diploma,btohqsg
and how A level is a internationally recognized exam while poly isnt,btohqsg
yes..but if you are at the other end of the ladder  you are basically diw,btohqsg
need degree rightif you really wanted to,btohqsg
Wait but if yiu just pass a levels can go to a private uni right,btohqsg
you fail a levels also can,btohqsg
"private unis are called ""private"" for a reason",btohqsg
I can just become a lawyer after o level wow,btohqsg
i mean in your stance..it would be better to be in poly cause at least you wont be a loose goose during uni studies,btohqsg
I heard they're very expensive as well,btohqsg
private uni's teach very differently from govt uni's,btohqsg
that's what my classmate who refuses to study and got e8-f9 for most of his grades ended up goinghe said that he's going to australia for overseas study or some shit,btohqsg
Who recognises Malaysia India uni certs lol,btohqsg
"honestly the education system is not a doom or gloom...the issue is most of the students who feel that ""they will never be anything""...dont put in effort to change",btohqsg
If you are willing to change  you wont starve on the streets,btohqsg
Isnt the university of mumbai cert for cs bttr than MIT,btohqsg
I don't want to be stuck with some lazy person in jc to do pw,btohqsg
If u not in jc now,btohqsg
waitttt i heard that jc is removing pw for uni admissions requirement next yearthen the rp will drop from 90 to 70,btohqsg
Since pw wld b pass fail anyw,btohqsg
good luck for o's next year,btohqsg
Failed 3 subjects this term lol,btohqsg
Coz with lower rp cap means more full marks  means the grind turns frm acads to portfolio  which is arguably worse,btohqsg
The student triangle is playing out,btohqsg
If I want good sleep and good grades bye bye to social life,btohqsg
I take like 50 mins to go to sch lol,btohqsg
3 people were caught vaping in my sch,btohqsg
that's not true. You just don't need to use handphone,btohqsg
i never had a social life to begin with,btohqsg
At least u can see how far u are frm the top if its j acad  but portfolio sometimes u dont even know what kind of opportunities u can find,btohqsg
u want social life  can social life all the way,btohqsg
For me I think my sec sch is still quite shut,btohqsg
So of course not that well classmates,btohqsg
For me I'm aiming to be top student in my sch now,btohqsg
I only understood that and applied it extensively during uni studies,btohqsg
Fk my social life can have it in jc,btohqsg
Study with whatever time I have,btohqsg
Secondary school alot of it is memory work,btohqsg
Hell even jc is mostly memory work,btohqsg
uni  2 of my days I had lessons from 8am to 8pm  so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I mean at least you don't have to wake up at 5 45 am,btohqsg
nope  sleep at 545 am and wake at 7am,btohqsg
Damn what were you doing from 8 to 5 45,btohqsg
I mean  what for study hard in sec sch and jc just to flunk at uni,btohqsg
And were the lessons back to back,btohqsg
some of the days. Because of practical work,btohqsg
imagine ending lesson at 8pm and then your work need to submit by 12 next day,btohqsg
Uni alot of it is self directed,btohqsg
Is cca all that important in secondary school though,btohqsg
but lessons start at 8am next day with no break  that means need to submit by 8am,btohqsg
Imo just completing the syllabus is more than doable,btohqsg
only if your grades are good,btohqsg
Jc and sec school cca useless,btohqsg
I did not treat cca seriously this year and fooled around so tch say I can do whatever I want,btohqsg
sounds like my poly except -6hrs,btohqsg
Trying to chase that l1r5 6,btohqsg
instead of 12 the next day...its 12am the same day,btohqsg
As long as got >30% 90rp,btohqsg
Honestly as a RP student  i legit dont know what kind of knowlegde rp expect their students to leave with after 3 years,btohqsg
Yea my Mt shit like 55,btohqsg
Like ppl can submit half completed worksheets...submit late  miss submissions and still get a gpa above 3,btohqsg
As long as median 85 rp lol,btohqsg
Then I also got chance to go law in uni,btohqsg
No pt 90rp then go engi,btohqsg
Heard singapore uni of self studying,btohqsg
Law not necessarily sanity for money,btohqsg
Up side of investment banker is u save on rent since u sleeping under ur desk anyw,btohqsg

I limit myself to 1 a day,btohqsg
Wait in uni can take dmaa I see ppl go hyper,btohqsg
My sch is pasir ris crest sec,btohqsg
For legal reasons this is a joke,btohqsg
Also hor u wan do law coz money or coz passion,btohqsg
Guys brace for my investment banking pitch,btohqsg
For money the highest paying regular job is investment banking,btohqsg
I mean under the umbrella of IB,btohqsg
I've heard law is also like office job but better,btohqsg
But aiming for public prosecutor thi,btohqsg
I mean i classify VC M&A S&T all under IB,btohqsg
Any fin job that isnt PB/consulting is IB,btohqsg
HiFi shld be the bttr phrase,btohqsg

I've heard eunia jc have 3 days mental wellness leave,btohqsg
The mental issues come from catching up,btohqsg
i need mental wellness leave from life,btohqsg
In ns I can apply to uni right,btohqsg
Oh noes I've been extradited by the people's loony army,btohqsg
Despite what some eunoia HATERS say,btohqsg
I got no choice one u got bro,btohqsg
Also isn't the gp dept shit,btohqsg
i need mental wellness leave too,btohqsg
I still keep in contact with my gp profs,btohqsg
All sg sec students need mental illness leave,btohqsg
Also how do I experience jc subj before I apply,btohqsg
i did it last year alr,btohqsg
Just curious  asking for a friend  do they serve alcohol is ns,btohqsg
Bc I see like from some show they sneak it in,btohqsg

Imagine a few weeks without bedok,btohqsg
Got some ppl 19 20 la,btohqsg
i feel old just seeing people go ord lo,btohqsg
So that's what the bmt at lasir ris sign means,btohqsg
BTW how study for jc after o level on my own,btohqsg
At least in jc more competitive,btohqsg
Olevels a lot of strats dont work at all,btohqsg
Had someone who did subject spotting for Olvls say he does that in As,btohqsg
He's still in J1 tho at that time,btohqsg
at the end of the tunnel,btohqsg
Haven't got the content Amt set in,btohqsg
ngl im lowkey in reality alr,btohqsg
ording soon and using it to annoy newer nsfs,btohqsg

ive been saying ord since i entered,btohqsg
U wan me invite the rest of discock here,btohqsg
Oh yea how important is conduct grade in sec sch,btohqsg
my jc conduct grade was ‚Äúfair‚Äù all the way,btohqsg
Your RP most important maybe scholarship they look MAYBE,btohqsg
seeing as i have a degree,btohqsg
I heard as long as mo integrity issue is ok,btohqsg
Na bro as long as no criminal record can liao,btohqsg
Ppl have sex in other countries to get money and buy food/buy needs.This girl decide to give some to buy online currency,btohqsg
That one is the only thing u need to declare,btohqsg
For someone to do this either the education on sex in Singapore is not adequate or we really got a online addiction problem,btohqsg
i slept throughout my GP lessons üòÇ,btohqsg
i slept through all my classes‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I mean if there is a will there is a way lol,btohqsg
meanwhile my mentee in ri is keeping a count of how many times she‚Äôs fallen asleep in each subject,btohqsg
Wait does rp matter with igp,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen ppl sleep through their lessons but when it‚Äôs showtime  they give results,btohqsg
But with the 70RP system the difference is negligible,btohqsg
sleeping through gp lectures in the auditorium was damn nice,btohqsg
I never had any GP training,btohqsg
i‚Äôm so proficient at sleeping in lecture that i carried it over to uni too,btohqsg
Btw does portfolio matter when applying for law,btohqsg
Although I'm gonna take up debating in jc,btohqsg
Rn stuck with this shitty public speaking,btohqsg
portfolio is smth that supplements a good rp,btohqsg
Bc very relevant and make me standout?,btohqsg
so if it‚Äôs a very competitive course,btohqsg
RP over everything and u better spend time in gp,btohqsg
it might be the thing that gives you an edge,btohqsg
but rp needs to be good first la,btohqsg
Yea gotta remember not to overdo,btohqsg
And for law spend it in GP also,btohqsg
How to start studying gp straight after o levels,btohqsg
Use holy grail to see the questions first,btohqsg
I have eng tuition so shld be OK to send it for marking,btohqsg
Should be but it's different tho,btohqsg
I shld be able to neglect mt,btohqsg
I mean my eng tutor also teaches jc gp,btohqsg
Just focus on your Os bro,btohqsg
This term I did terribly so I shall put in more effort,btohqsg
Is redoing exm qns good tho?,btohqsg
Yeah u have more pressing issues than GP and As rn,btohqsg
Only if u are able to understand what u did wrong last time.,btohqsg
i think you should focus on your weaker subjectssince you're sec 3 you still have time,btohqsg
you‚Äôre getting way too ahead of yourself with As lmao,btohqsg
yeah just focus on your studies rn,btohqsg
I'm going to Malaysia later lol,btohqsg
don't need to be so worried about the future tbhworry about your grades now lol,btohqsg
Yeah focus on getting a good L5 for JC first,btohqsg
but it's good to have some time to relax also,btohqsg
Should I aim for like 8 hours of studying a week?,btohqsg
Mental willness leave should be a standard MOE thing in my opinion,btohqsg
On Saturday should be able to study like 4 hrs,btohqsg
How many do u current do?,btohqsg
it‚Äôs more practical in my experience to focus on covering certain things in the day,btohqsg
instead of a certain number of hours,btohqsg
Oh yea this week I clocked in abt 4 hrs of studying and hw,btohqsg
For bio rn I'm writing notes,btohqsg
Yeah but it's nice to start a habit but as usual la it's what u do with the time,btohqsg
To get the foundation for chapters right,btohqsg
For maths do prelim exams right?,btohqsg
i just mean to be more specific with what you do in that time,btohqsg
lol tbh i only suffered mental health issues because of bullyingnot really grades or studying relatedbut i do get tired from studying,btohqsg
oo you took bio? :osame for me when I was in sec sch,btohqsg
Same... same :( I deleted social media accounts for a reason,btohqsg
for me it was irl bullying,btohqsg
I can't score in physics so I took bio,btohqsg
ive always been a target of bullying in school,btohqsg
Like I don't want to answer electrical qn,btohqsg
but last time i used to actually care about the insultsnow I just dgaf anymore,btohqsg
Yea not only my classmates h8 bio,btohqsg
i took combined bio and chem,btohqsg
i also felt that physics is too difficult for mesince i realized that i had lots of issues understanding physics related stuff,btohqsg
I hate maths.. I never understood it beyond linear and quad,btohqsg
I can't score in physics...so i took up a major in physics,btohqsg
would have taken bio in a heartbeat if my sec school actually offered it,btohqsg
They are booing it cuz they don't understand it,btohqsg
but back then there was no such thing as comb bio+chem in my sch,btohqsg
Why do physics when u can just do it irl,btohqsg
same but i mostly hate math because it's just a boring subjectyoure just learning graphs solving equations and formulasnot much actual info to learnlike actual knowledge,btohqsg
I can sense a disturbance.. most ppl here all like maths one,btohqsg
fr we didn't even slander phy ü•±,btohqsg
The theory is in pure maths,btohqsg
Nabei u take FM for fun isit,btohqsg
Ikr what has bio gotta do it with,btohqsg
huhas in a math in o levelsor further math in jc,btohqsg
It's not the math you learn in sch,btohqsg
The real math is called pure math,btohqsg
I have no idea what the fuck that means,btohqsg
E.g. set theory  analysis  algebra  etc,btohqsg
I just nod whenever maths majors explain themselves,btohqsg
but the x power of 0 = 1 and divide by 0 has no answer is interesting though,btohqsg
like i went out of my way to search why it's like that,btohqsg
hi fellow singaporeans (except kuro ofc),btohqsg
What did kuro do sia hahah,btohqsg
ntg ah I js miss him,btohqsg
ryan u in xdd era ah,btohqsg
Just holding the wrong red passport,btohqsg
