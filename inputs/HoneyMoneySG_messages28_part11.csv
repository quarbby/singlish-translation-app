Same loh... just found AXS can pay IRAS with CC then happlily skipped my GIRO installment and paid a few thousand with Citi cash back+ and got no cash back at all. Never read TnC üò≠,btohqsg
I am using GIRO for my tax too‚Ä¶.üôÉ so it means AXS then use CC pay can get certain cashback / miles?,btohqsg
Is the UOB EVOL Card a good cashback card?,btohqsg
can pay but no rewards due to CC exclusion,btohqsg
GIRO is good for now due to high interest. +1% cashback from EGA better,btohqsg
maybe due to roaming? that SMS number could be local only,btohqsg
In the past hearsay no such exclusion,btohqsg
Car installment can use to earn miles? Hearsay CARDUP can buy overall you paying for the miles,btohqsg
How should I approach this? Use cpf or cash for hdb downpayment and mortgage? I'm buying a hdb  bto in 6 years key collection  if use cpf first can repay the amounts used and accused interest?,btohqsg
Use the money that is yielding the lowest return. In current high interest environment  use OA first. Grow your cash in fixed deposit/t bills. When interest rates drop below 2.5%  then refund to your OA.,btohqsg
The only card was Amex high flyer + GPMC but it lockout now,btohqsg
If really want earn miles with FCY then use amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
i got a shopee transaction which is still not posted in my UOBOne card since 20th Jan. End up I unable to hit the $500 min spend. The whole quarter cash rebate gone. ü•≤,btohqsg
Is it possible to refund OA specifically with cash?,btohqsg

Hi guys. If I activate my newly received credit card on 30 Jan. Does it mean my statement month will be on 30th every month?,btohqsg
Uob said it's shopee side that delay the posting. Nothing wrong on their end,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any card strategy for procedures like lasik?,btohqsg
Nope usually the banks have their own statement dates,btohqsg
Yes i know but u can try appeal for the quarter cashback,btohqsg
More details needed for us to suggest suitable cards  e.g. where do you do the lasik (hospital  optician  etc)  how much does it cost  how do you pay (online or contactless)  is it one shot payment or by installments?,btohqsg
Hi all  which card is good for hotel wedding banquet payment? dbs woman's card if hotel can allow us to pay 2k monthly? TIA,btohqsg

Under HSBC rewards programme  if I use the debit card linked to EGA to pay for public transport  would I get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong debit card spend doesn‚Äôt have a whitelist right,btohqsg
So you mean doesn't matter which day I activate my credit card. The statement date is sort of fixed by bank already?,btohqsg

Starhub is Telco MCC. No 10x rewards points on hsbc revolution as Telco MCC is not in the whitelist of MCC for 10x rewards points. Can get 10x points on dbs wwmc or citi rewards if paid monthly online via starhub app/website.SP is utilities MCC. No 10x points on any card.
