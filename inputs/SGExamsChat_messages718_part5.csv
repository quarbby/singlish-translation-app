i just shredded my brother's work to pieces,btohqsg
How do you usually deliver the shit to them,btohqsg
and helped him redo the whole thing,btohqsg
Do you straight up no sugarcoat tell them off,btohqsg
actually my comments q nice one,btohqsg
""" the shit U write is shit""- Walter rand",btohqsg
Speaking of sugarcoating  some people can be very mean when not sugarcoating,btohqsg
i just rewrite their work for them,btohqsg
I literally broke down and she said things that are really harsh and unreasonable,btohqsg
And putting words in my mouth,btohqsg
if im rly pissed off yes,btohqsg
I canâ€™t really remember what I said,btohqsg
"I will go through ur HCI DRQ at a later date as it is very badly done. You seem to have forgotten how to do DRQ entirely.1. You misinterpreted ALOT of the command words and you seem to provide very brief explanations without CLEAR use of the resources. Even for the part (e) qn  you only used one resource when the qn very explicitly wanted you to use more than one resource. For DRQ  Resources > Own information. You can get 9/9 without even using your own information. Some questions you also don't even answer the question (2b)2. I said this before  same for essay. You cannot just say ""over spatial dimensions"" or ""over temporal dimensions"". Stop force-fitting the evaluation into your essay for the sake of it. If it doesn't make sense  it also won't boost your score. You need to clearly explain what this means. Look at the sample essays in the Essay Bank for reference.3. Mark distribution. You wrote 4 sentences for a 6m question. a 6m question requires 3 WELL-EXPLAINED IDEAS. Because of this  you already basically said goodbye to 4 of the 6 marks possible. If you do this for your DRQ (which is where most students would score in) you are basically going to doom your A Level grade because most students can easily get 80 and above for DRQ.4. GI: You need to make clear references to what Accuracy and reliability means especially if the qn ask for it. for both part d and e  you seem to entirely throw away reliability and only talk about accuracy.",btohqsg
Oh ya I heard being a PT moe cher?  is an unstable income because usu the Cher would uk not say laid off but more of being allocated to another sch ( eg you're teaching at tertiary and all of a sudden when that sch doesn't need u anymore you're gonna be  allocated to somewhere else where sec sch is a possible choice tooðŸ’€ ),btohqsg
That's what my GP PT Cher said or smth,btohqsg
Hopefully my productivity will go back up after my interview,btohqsg
I really get very distracted nowadays,btohqsg

Did she do ok in the end,btohqsg
My teachers were never pissed at me,btohqsg
Er like I had this section leader who hated me for all sort of reason,btohqsg
"Eh idk man normally when there's no sugarcoating...it's usually ""harsher"" which is sort of mean in its own way",btohqsg
Then I canâ€™t really rmb but tension rose between us then someone helped us piece tgt and organise a meeting coz I was just complaining to her nonstop about this person,btohqsg
Like this kind of ppl is what I mean by making skills into a character issue,btohqsg
Ok let me now go back to force myself past this chapter coz tmr is a 100% interview day,btohqsg
i mean there's a line between being blunt and being an asshole,btohqsg
some people like to be assholes and say oh i'm just being blunt,btohqsg
Bruh even if I know my friends dun give a damn  I dun actually say these things,btohqsg
No it is not a point to say things out of nowhere,btohqsg
At least say things that are legit,btohqsg
She can claim Iâ€™m the weakest member and yet poor attitude,btohqsg
if they're attacking then it's not not sugarcoating alr,btohqsg
Bruh I was in exco and does she think I hv all the time in the world and must I tell her specifically when I going to practice,btohqsg
Is it lol I find it's a very thin line for some,btohqsg
It's prob subjective at this pt,btohqsg
She has given me enough troubles when I was doing my exco duties,btohqsg
it's very clear cut to me lol,btohqsg
I mean yea when u put it that way,btohqsg
She is really making skills issue into a character issue bruh,btohqsg
i mean some people can't take it when someone is being blunt,btohqsg
and be like wow you're an asshole,btohqsg
blunt vs asshole  taking criticism vs being a doormat for insults,btohqsg
see what side you wanna be on,btohqsg
Popular sells IP schools test papers?,btohqsg
Make a guess which course she is in,btohqsg
Why you being such a naughty boy boy,btohqsg
I know you love being in the limelight,btohqsg
If I know Iâ€™m wrong  there is nothing wrong about someone being bluntâ€¦if it is something I know it is not me and u are saying it as if I have poor attitude and what notâ€¦you are just throwing hate for the sake of it and deny things,btohqsg
then my question becomes why do you care yk,btohqsg
If only you'd act that wayðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®,btohqsg
