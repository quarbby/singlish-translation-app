Yes for other polys its like sec sch lor just that got lectures,btohqsg
everyone will be in the same class. Everyday is dedicated to 1 topic for the assigned module. eg: every Monday is Maths  Tuesday is Arts History etc.,btohqsg
the day will be split into 3 phases 1st phase the lecturer will go through the slides of what the lesson will be about and introduce the problem statement (Which you usually don't need to solve on your own)then you go for first break  45 mins - 1hr2nd phase is the part where you do some exercises related to the lesson to get a better sense at solving the problem statement. Most lessons will have you working on these in a group.You can also start working on creating the presentation slides for your solution to the day's problem statement.Then lunch break  1hr 30 mins - 2 hrs3rd phase is usually on completing your presentation slides with ur group. Usually the lecturer will be ready to help students when they have any questions  so it's very helpful to clarify on problems,btohqsg
finally each team takes turns to present their slides to the class to show what they've learnt for the lesson,btohqsg
He just let me die thr,btohqsg
which is your team's solution to the problem statement,btohqsg
but presentation is usually not scary  because it's only to ur own classmates and to ur lecturer,btohqsg
