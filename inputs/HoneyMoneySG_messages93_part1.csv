Hi  may i check which wifi broadband yall recommend for a 1 year plan? Cheap and reliable  500mbps/1gbps is fine  only for 2 ppl,btohqsg
Simba or Whizzcom. Maybe Whizzcom as it is powered by SingTel.,btohqsg
sorry   if I only have these 4 credit cards: UOB one  Citi rewards  DBS Yuu VISA  or UOB Absolute cashback card  which card is the best to book scoot flight tickets? thank you,btohqsg
Hi all any card to recommend as my 2nd credit card for purchases made physically (not online) that is 4MPD?I alr have the UOB PPV to max out $1k but for subsequent purchases after $1k  I would like another card. I will likely only spend $100-300 on this card monthly!Any card except HSBC Revolution bc I had some declined issues and have to wait 6 months  thanks!,btohqsg
I m not sure what is the difference between PPV n VS. but you can explore VS which has min $1k spend n max $2k spend to earn 4mpd. Not sure is it suit you? If can  consolidation all your spends in VS.,btohqsg
UOB VS is ideal for paywave between $1000-$2000. Main difference between PPV and VS: bonus points for PPV given per transaction  while for VS it is given per accumulated spend in that statement month.Another difference is UOB VS can tap physically too (not limited to mobile contactless).,btohqsg
Vs can be used on uob$ merchant and ppv can NOT be used on uob$ merchants  due to the difference on when the uni$ is rewarded,btohqsg
For this promo  cant earn krisflyer miles right?,btohqsg
i have an account with moo moo already   still dont know how to use   can anyone briefly mention how to avail the 6.8%,btohqsg
Not sure. Just book n enter your Krisflyer number on membership field. Use eligible miles credit card to purchase.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúOcbc salary transfer‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
has anyone not received their bonus uni$ at the start of the month?received as normal dec'23 and Jan'24 but the start of month credit was missing for Feb'24,btohqsg
I received mine on 1 Feb for VS and Lady‚Äôs no issue,btohqsg
thanks mate  let me drop them an email,btohqsg
im looking for a card that doesnt have min spend of $1k as i only plan to spend less than $1k on this second card unfortunately. let me know if theres any recco all  thank you! :),btohqsg
So people suggesting you  instead of maxing out UOB PPV and looking to spend excess on another card  spend everything on UOB VS (no need for UOB PPV).,btohqsg
but i cannot as i may not hit $1k on physical spending on some months thats why üòÖ,btohqsg
Then maybe go for Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Can also see if any of your spend can fit into UOB Lady‚Äôs categories  that one has no minimum to hit and pools the same points as PPV,btohqsg
Another option to work with a $1k minimum card is to have some frontload spending options (e.g. top up NTUC gift cards) to still be able to reach the min  if you end up falling slightly short for that month.But of course at the start of the month do your own forecast first and only start spending on the VS if you think there‚Äôs a reasonable chance of hitting the minimum that month,btohqsg
Can I know how do I earn points/miles from booking Scoot flights? Can I just go to scoot app and input kris membership No?,btohqsg
Can party A book flights for party B using uob krisflyer credit card and party A can get 3mpd? Party A wont be booking a ticket for himself,btohqsg
The card that is used for payment is the card that will get points or miles,btohqsg
Uob1 also adb  mab only for promo earmark,btohqsg
UserYHhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no referral links,btohqsg
If i want to achieve uob one and ocbc 350 card spend of 500 person then but my spending is sometimes 500-2000  is there a way I can able to even out and still eligible to the card spend evenly 1k per month for both saving account üôè please,btohqsg
Today I saw a tips people use dbs bank cc can pay their other credit card bills  although doesn't qualify for point but can pay 1 month later then you can keep the fund longer in high interest account.,btohqsg
but no accumulation of miles   not worth it after all,btohqsg
I'm sure it affects your credit score one way or another lol,btohqsg
But applying lots of card and not every card u really use  and not able spend that much  end up changing your behaviour to contact less spend   check mcc.... once u just use this card on card u put ur money another month 4% in ocbc 360 for example. Of course in extreme you can even do ocbc NXT card and extend everything into installment but that maybe have make the accounting more difficult,btohqsg
Any recommended expense tracking app that can sync to multiple banks (UOB and DBS)?Considering subscribing to spendee? Anyone have experience?,btohqsg
More trust card changes... For those who actually use it,btohqsg
As with many things in life  you pay (in one way or another) for convenience,btohqsg
Now my problem is cannot do so much card spend on every high interest account!,btohqsg
Option 1: Put in the effort to earn 5-8% back (on average) per transaction in miles or cashbackOption 2: Figure out a way to delay paying the statement for a month to earn 5% p.a. = ~0.42% from the bank.Doesn‚Äôt even seem like much of a comparison worth considering,btohqsg
You have a good point here. üëâ  option one!,btohqsg
Pay off timely with GIRO on HSBC EGA for 1% cashback also.,btohqsg
April this year many changes to many cards  min spent increased rebate reduced.,btohqsg
Reading up on it. I'm assuming none of the expense tracking app can categorize spending by mcc right?,btohqsg
I am doing excel to tracking for monthly expenses. Time consuming. I am also interested for easy way.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if Amaze transactions (not top-up Amaze wallet) qualify for the $800 minimum spend for DBS/POSB $388 welcome offer for new cardholders? I understand that Amaze transactions are excluded from DBS card rewards.,btohqsg
U answer your own question liao. If it is excluded from rewards then what does it tell u?,btohqsg
My advice is: Explore around the free trials  and see on a price level which one suits u best,btohqsg
Hi all   for uob one account  must card transaction be before 3 day from the end of the month to be considered as counted into the spending of 500$?,btohqsg
It have to be posted by the last day of the month,btohqsg
Hi. Wanna check whether shopee paylater is a qualifying spend for uob one credit card cash back? The tnc didn't specify shopee paylater under excluded transaction,btohqsg
Which means last transaction date to be safe would be 3 days before last month,btohqsg
I think u need to phrase 3 working day,btohqsg
Ah okey thank u appreciate it!,btohqsg
