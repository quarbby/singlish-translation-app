Sorry guys..am very new and blur here,btohqsg
Chat more jiu not blur liao,btohqsg
You are a dude with a chio bu pic?,btohqsg
The dms you received are at least more interesting than mine,btohqsg
But chio bus getting all the dm and calls very normal lah...thats how the world works..very practical,btohqsg
As long as we all make friends and get along and enjoy life a little...all is good and well,btohqsg
"If one is sending dm to a total stranger he should do better than saying ""hi"" repeatedly",btohqsg
And asking whats your name is practically asking to be shot down,btohqsg
Haha well then u have to sort out all the dm and see which ones you want to follow up one...who knows maybe one of them will turn out to be the proposal you were waiting for,btohqsg
No need to sort. One hammer fits all,btohqsg
Whether its guys or girls...these young ones dont have the skills to know people better..i mean..even if somd dude were to be interested in a chio bu..most local guys just dont have the tact or grey matter to initiate and follow thru,btohqsg
Thats not what i meant. Most of these are just bad at intiating a convo online. The age doesn't matter,btohqsg
Yes i do agree to a certain extent..age doesnt matter..but more and more locals just simply cannot hold a conversation or even string a few intelligent sentences,btohqsg
Its also upbringing..with all these young punks wannabe and shallow pursuits..they will just continue to be worker bees in future,btohqsg
I totally agreed on it. Especially the part on the ‘intelligent sentences’,btohqsg
This is 100% true so all you young ones have to forge your own paths and not believe 100% what cheng hu said,btohqsg
In a way..the 20something will have to work extra hard just to make it and prosper in 20 years time,btohqsg
Just like how the generation had it even better than my generation as those building their careers in the 70s and 80s have made it by now if they were hardworking,btohqsg
80s were considered the boom years for sg,btohqsg
We complained about the 1st gen leaders but they brought us to where we are now but the 4th gen leaders...they will ruin us,btohqsg
The scholar system is broken from us outside in private sector looking into the pampered public sector,btohqsg
In fact we outside here look down on scholars and we only make use of them if they are street smart enough and willing to be humble..else we will just tell them join the civil service,btohqsg
Thats why 1st gen leaders are way way better,btohqsg
Sound like you are a big boss 🙈,btohqsg
Small is good now..big companies and big bosses suffering so we many many small bosses combine strength and go out to hurt the big companies and big bosses because they cannot pivot fast enough due to the china virus,btohqsg
Haha ok lah..my apologies but its still a fact the communists want the whole world to kowtow to them..nothing against chinese yah...chinese are a beautiful people...its their ideology which we must guard against...communism....,btohqsg
Our beloved lao lee fought his whole life against communism so that we have this wonderful life now...in case the young ones here don't know sg history,btohqsg
Even the confucius institute in ntunis a nest of communists,btohqsg
