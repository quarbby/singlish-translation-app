Thanks Mr Anwo  i like making car sounds! tried making a subie exhaust notes but all that came out was silence,btohqsg

I don’t want to call it an “entry level mid engine sports car” because it would not be respectful but honestly this car has my vote for a solid mid engine 1.8L DCT performance car. Look at the engineering and the materials used on it 😍😍 the pricing really is relatively good.,btohqsg
This always reminds me of the BMW i8  they definitely beat Maxhaust at making a maxhaust in my opinion,btohqsg
I do agree that for tht price  it delivers alot! Great balance and amazing handling. Good acceleration with a proper gearbox. All together just packages such a nimble track ready yet road friendly sportscar.,btohqsg
Yep yep. Credit to them this round.,btohqsg
the styling is also great! they've been able to bring the old Alpine elements in really well,btohqsg
What I meant by them paying tribute to the original classic rally car,btohqsg
CANCELLED! MAZDASPEED MIATA IS THE BEST,btohqsg
