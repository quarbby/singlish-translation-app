Hey ya‚Äôll  curious question. Which fuel is better for day to day performance and reliability ah? Shell or Esso?,btohqsg
in the long run no difference,btohqsg
people that tell you got difference are just talking rubbish,btohqsg
Just use the recommended grade or above,btohqsg
Additives from each brand are different but they're only on the 98 fuels usually,btohqsg
no need to go above also  there's virtually no performance increase other than psychological,btohqsg
Actually this depends on how modern the car is. Old cars sure their ECUs are not advanced to understand and adjust their ignition timings to squeeze out the most of the fuel.Modern cars are more adaptive. Able to adapt to the minimum octane fuel it is rated to vs the high octane one. Of course it is not a huge difference but can see the timings all more advanced to get more power when it is demanded for,btohqsg
