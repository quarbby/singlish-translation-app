Good afternoon all  need advice about how to invest my SRS funds.I used to just invest in SSB and T Bills.,btohqsg
Hi can i know where is the best place to invest in S&P 500?,btohqsg
For longbridge new user promo.. in order to get the rewards  i need to do 5 trade‚Ä¶ can I use the 10k sgd that I deposited to do the trade? Or i need to top up more for the trade. üôè,btohqsg
do you mean platform or which etf,btohqsg
dont think anyone can give you an answer like this as no one knows your risk appetite/tolerance and many other things. many videos posted here to give many options  you can watch and decide which best suits you,btohqsg
yes  remember to not do any cash withdrawals until end of holding period,btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to investing so maybe can begin with which platform that allows SRS funds to be invested.,btohqsg
So i can use the 10k to do min 5 trades and the rest can go to mmf for higher yield? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Platform wise: there is POEMS and Endowus for the hotpicks,btohqsg

In case I didn‚Äôt mention this hack before. No need to choose retail category for Maybank fnf if u need popular.Just use ShopBack at popular linked to Maybank fnf. Mcc is 5311 under online shopping. I do it even safer.ShopBack > amaze > Maybank fnf online shopping category.,btohqsg

Heymax introduces in-store/online ntuc gift card. ü•∞Looks like HSBC Revo and ocbc rewards can live longer.,btohqsg
I'm surprised no one mentioned Changi Pay... There's current promotion till end of March where every $500 spent will earn $50 e-voucher in Changi Pay.,btohqsg
Anyone didn‚Äôt manage to get their UOB lady‚Äôs annual fee waived? I got rejected twice despite paying bills on time and spending at least $500 monthly on the cardü•≤,btohqsg
Yep! Anyway changi pay in China uses Alipay network  need to use liquid pay wallet so can't use amaze. So it has to be FX charges if you scan and pay in China.,btohqsg
I spent like 3k for that card  managed get it waived in app on Aug 24,btohqsg
My own DP is UOB is now tighter with annual fee waivers (hope not copying SCB)last time almost always see GREEN SCREENnow mostly is BLUE screen (officer to call you back),btohqsg
Hi  Can trust credit card be linked to Alipay? In this case  no need to incur FX loss ( not as much as other credit cards). Is this correct?,btohqsg
My Subway don‚Äôt accept favepay. Any idea which  merchant accept this mode of payment ? Thanks,btohqsg
It can be linked. If you not into miles or points game,btohqsg
Thanks. More for CN usage for holidays,btohqsg
If I purchase $100 vouchers  can I use it slowly over many purchases?,btohqsg
Setup WeChat pay as well. Have at least 2 credit cards linked. Sometimes banks in their overzealous may block the card when they start seeing lines of transactions done in china which they may tot is fraud. I got it one time and had to use the bank app to tell them to unblock,btohqsg
Can send me pineapple tart please ?,btohqsg
Oh  can use YOUTRIP for card 2,btohqsg
That works as well. Btw trust card was blocked for me the first night I was in Shanghai and in China ü§£,btohqsg
Bring some remibi currency just in case. I standby $100 worth of it. For the strangest reason  Alipay or WeChat couldn‚Äôt work in Shenzhou to purchase train tickets. Yet it works in other cases. So definitely not credit card issue.,btohqsg
UserPhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:google pal exchange is not for this chat,btohqsg
How long will the rewards take to come in? 6 months?,btohqsg
"For salary crediting of $1K into CIMB FastSaver account  does it work using personal DBS account choosing ""Salary Payment"" option?",btohqsg
Sorry to bother  wanted to ask abt IBKR to purchase VWRA if anyone knows.I have some amts (a few K) that I would like to buy units of VWRA which are currently priced roughly $143.XX. When I keep trying to purchase units  it will say insufficient and I have to lower the value  then end up I still have abt 1K USD spare as balance but just wondering why I couldn‚Äôt buy a few more units of VWRA. Using market price in the order if it‚Äôs relevant.Thank you if anyone knows :),btohqsg
Under preview  It‚Äôll show how much your funds would be left after the purchase (you can buy fractional shares  so just adjust accordingly),btohqsg
Okay got it thank youuuu  now all of a sudden when I have 1K USD left  I could buy more units. Previously when I keep trying to add a few units  they mentioned insufficient funds at preview.Thanks once agn!,btohqsg
Remember to change your pricing plan to tiered  if not you‚Äôll incur more cost. & if you‚Äôre using a cash account  you dont have to convert SGD manually  they‚Äôll auto convert when you‚Äôre buying in,btohqsg

Oh so you have tried and get 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
I tried and it didn‚Äôt  asked CS and they confirmed no 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Yup  received my $19.60 for last month ü§£,btohqsg
Yeah but this doesn‚Äôt say what transactions earned your cashback though. Under your cashback history  do you see bus/mrt?,btohqsg
Sorry  I think simplygo cannot  misunderstood thought the question was can we simply go and use the credit card and get 1.7% without other criteria üôè sorry. SPACE matters üòÇ,btohqsg
