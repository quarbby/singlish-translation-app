Go SG Car MartFind a car that you feel is underpriced. Buy it.List the car. Sell it for more than you paid.As said you need to know the market and if you do it right  you can make money.I am not an expert and I did not conduct the above before  but I heard before and I have friends who are doing the above.Even watches also can do such thing if you have the expertise.,btohqsg
Exactly... if the exact method is revealed.. and everyone does it.. no more money to make liao,btohqsg

IMO  No free lunch to make money in this world  There is also no one size fit all formula. Sheer hard work to get your first pot of gold  then roll it to bigger pieces. speed to get the pot depends on how hungry one is. Good luck üëçüèª,btohqsg
