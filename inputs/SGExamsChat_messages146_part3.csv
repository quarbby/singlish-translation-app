didnâ€™t apply the other sch cause couldnâ€™t afford at that time. Rn the application closed and too late alrd. But I might apply next year if I donâ€™t get into sit,btohqsg
Tbh I donâ€™t rlly understand I mean students can go nafa/ lasalle if they want go art sch,btohqsg
But mdis is a good prg la,btohqsg
Is there any short course math sci related that can be done,btohqsg
Sometimes its bc nafa/laselle too expensive or too difficult to get in. And also their curricular system is different from mdis. Mdis more relaxed n flexible (more like adult uni)  less stressful/strict too,btohqsg
Degree in diagnostic radiography is it the one u looking at?,btohqsg
What kind of design u studied in diploma?,btohqsg
Haha looks like don need to do a full alevels,btohqsg
Yup take specific papers will do (should be)ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Everyt I did web design magazine deign + videography and photography,btohqsg
Not the same as the digital design. RP media production and design,btohqsg
So technically I can just take bio and math a lvl?,btohqsg
The text in the pic says you need GP and MT as well,btohqsg
Dunno how it works for private candidate admissions  but most people take 3H2 1H1 with GP and MT  so you might want to email SIT to confirm if you need to do this too,btohqsg
What about PW? I know private candidates don't take it but I'm not sure if it would negatively affect the application,btohqsg
I jus got off the phone frm sit la they stated as long as itâ€™s a general hospital setting in terms of experience,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t ask bout a lvls,btohqsg
The uni canâ€™t reasonably ask you to take PW  and u donâ€™t really have a way to do it without a JC anyway,btohqsg
Iâ€™m trying to avoid a lvls if possible bc itâ€™s so content heavyðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I wonâ€™t be able to take h2 bc my o lvls subjects were combine and not strong enuf. I looked into MI as well but doesnâ€™t seem like thatâ€™s an option,btohqsg
But will email n cfm again!!,btohqsg
If ur combined science was good  like A1 good  H2 is not out of reach,btohqsg
It was kind of a c6,btohqsg
But of course if so idm taking h1 and h2,btohqsg
Thanks for all the advices guys ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Sheâ€™s trying to get a science course that requires 2H2 sciences,btohqsg
I guess hybrid is always an option though,btohqsg
Oh okay  I was confused since she mentioned the arts schools,btohqsg
Oh I was from an arts course :),btohqsg
But decided not to go forth with the path,btohqsg
I just saw the further Mathematics syllabus  they said they removed something this year  turns out they removed so little  hahaha,btohqsg
The last time I saw the further Mathematics syllabus  they said private candidates were not allowed to take it. Now they apparently can  but they have to register for H2 Mathematics first,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the most annoying thing in the syllabus,btohqsg
And I think it is only for this year. Next year  probably back to normal,btohqsg
U have to manually type in a bunch of stuff into a calculator and look up the wilcoxon table in MF26,btohqsg
Okay I guess Chi squared is more annoying in that sense,btohqsg
Yes! But double confirm with programme manager,btohqsg
Has anyone actually used the Wilcoxon test,btohqsg
Wow look  another b0t  posting while everyone is on,btohqsg
Well  I don't really know how to use the graphing calculator and I often just look up the formulae sheet. My mathematics and physics teachers complained that I don't know how to use it.I guess I was too reliant on my mental computations. Many teachers were concerned that the accuracy was compromised,btohqsg
@Flowers0103u still have a bit of foundation there  not that bad lei,btohqsg
How does x > y vs y > x help you,btohqsg
I can't imagine 1 day you walk into a business meeting,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t take any of this,btohqsg
To be honest  I can't remember what is the wilcoxon sign test,btohqsg
"And you say ""we did wilcoxon test so we know that product y has specification z greater than that of product a""But we don't know by how much",btohqsg
@Flowers0103i looked thru the modules  most HSC and DRGOkay lah  u r not too far off from what they need. Just top up with h2 bio and maths is really Good enuff,btohqsg
Ohh what did u take?? Why didnt take these?,btohqsg
Haha then do top up in coding ðŸ˜‚Oh ya suss offers biomedical engineering too u keen in that?,btohqsg
I did my intern overseas too,btohqsg
