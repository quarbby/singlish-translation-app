Just youtube  Google search b4 u ask.....,btohqsg
I did the creditcard method  there was a dynamic conversion fees etc.,btohqsg
Not sure if I did it wrongly,btohqsg
DO NOT buy using credit card. there's lot of fees charges by your bank. don't mislead by the app saying zero fees,btohqsg
Is best cpf strategy to max MA  then max to FRS (why not ERS?) and maintain 60k in OA (for the extra interests)? For those say 50 or older??,btohqsg
You cannot top up to ERS before 55  so only up till FRS. 60K OA is not required. I keep 20k just so I can invest the OA amount above 20k,btohqsg
Will your strategy after 55 be max MA  max ERS and maintain only 20k in OA 40k SA.  Since the first 60k in OA + SA attracts additional 1%?,btohqsg
Tapering not started panic selling occurred,btohqsg
Hello! If you have not transfer any money in  you can just ignore that portfolio and create the correct one  which is you'd eqty100,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  I just watched most of your Syfe  Endowus and credit card video. From what I understand  your cash back need to be higher than the credit fee in order to make ‚Äúprofit‚Äù.I‚Äôm a working adult  with below average spending. Other than the new credit card user bonus  is there a reason for me to get a credit card?,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs take cash back  every time we spend money credit card fee is 3%. So our cash back has to be higher than 3% for it to make sense?,btohqsg
I let the community answer this.But there's no 3% fee in normal merchants,btohqsg
Get one that matches your lifestyle.,btohqsg
I'm trying to understand my lifestyle also,btohqsg
My company sometime required me to take grab for work  spending is between $50 - $700 a month  very volatile so can't rely that to hit minimum spending amount. Initially I thought can use AMEX True saving to top up grab wallet and earn the unlimited 1.5% cashback. But AMEX transaction fee is between 2.5% to 3.5%. I'm still losing money.,btohqsg
You don't need to pay fees using AMEX top up grab,btohqsg
Is it? Sorry  I don't have CC yet. But a lot of my friends say they don't use any credit card to top up grab because of the fee.,btohqsg
That's the case for VISA cards,btohqsg
I know Visa need to pay $1 per top up if value is less than $400.,btohqsg
So when does the transaction fee really occur?,btohqsg
I concur with the first two  with the current policy now.Disregard the 20k oa 40k sa since once you reach 60k SA/MA  you will get that 1% capped,btohqsg
When you shop at merchants that prefer to take in cash and charge a premium 3% fee on credit card payments. E.g. IT Show  certain Mobile retailers,btohqsg
Only when you top up with a VISA card,btohqsg
Transaction fee?? I think u mistaken for fx fees. If u buy from overseas. Most credit card charge fx fees.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm here to seek some clarification with custom portfolio with Syfe Custom and Endowus Single Fund portfolio. With Syfe Custom  the platform fee is 0.65% if total invested value is less than $20K  followed by 0.5% from $20K to <$100K  0.40% above $100K and lastly 0.35% for above $500K. With Endowus  the fee is 0.6% for <$200K and 0.5% for $200k to $1M.,btohqsg
I know in the beginning of@ChrisHMSGrobo advisor journey video  He mentioned that Syfe is a better option to invest with cash. But now with Endowus Single Fund fee of 0.3%  is Syfe still the better option to for cash investment  or this is just happening to custom portfolio?,btohqsg
Transaction fees is not for us . It's merchant have to pay amex not us.,btohqsg
I should clarify that for Small amounts DCA  Syfe is a good option as no commission fee and no FX conversion fee  which can be a huge % if the DCA amount is small. Once portfolio size is larger  always better to go with brokers like Tiger/Moomoo/IB,btohqsg
investors and traders believe an action that will happen in the future so that they can buy or sell shares,btohqsg
Oh yes  i see the max MA is now 63k > 60k so we can ignore the 20 oa and 40 sa  so after 55  if the MA is say 63k in 2022  then transfer all OA and SA to achieve ERS? Or use cash to achieve ERS?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  Lets use a real case. Assuming at age 65 the MA is at max 63k in 2022  OA is 74k  and SA is 3k  and RA is only 177k (not at FRS of 192k)  step 1 would you use OA or cash or a combination (assuming still working and can get tax relieve RSTU and MA top up of total 8k a year now) to top up Cpf Life to FRS of 192k first‚Ä¶ then step 2 remaining OA towards ERS and thence 8k a year RSTU. Would you agree this is likely the best strategy? Now to determine whether to use all cash  or all OA or what combination of OA and cash to reach FRS of 192k (from 177k),btohqsg
Since you already have RA  make sense to just go for cash top up first to get tax relief,btohqsg

Is it much cheaper to buy ETF via moomoo/tiger than via Endowus/Syfe?,btohqsg
A basket of ETF. Broker you can buy specific ETF,btohqsg
you want cheap  IBKR is the best,btohqsg
but will take a bit of learning,btohqsg
coz setup account  convert currency  buy  all these you DIY,btohqsg
Endowus also can buy specific unit trust (e.g. tracking S&P500 index),btohqsg
the main selling point is convenience  you automate bank transfer then everything they do for you (FX exchange),btohqsg
Ya..heard ppl using IBKR to short shares..,btohqsg
Oh yeah Endowus can buy specific  Lionglobal. Syfe/Stashaway cannot.,btohqsg
Ok..seems like Stashaway n Endowus r the more popular ones,btohqsg
I believe this question only answered half. I just applied for the AMEX True Saver with the flash sales. So I can just transfer $5000 to grabpay and be eligible for the 3% cash back plus the reward of ipad 9th Gen?,btohqsg
I know $5000 3% is the AMEX side. But the singsaver promo need to spend $500 to redeem the gift. Does the $500 follows AMEX eligible spending list?,btohqsg
I simplified it. Cpf use endowus [monopoly] . Srs use fsmone [almost monopoly. Most etf and fund for it] Cash use ibkr. [most value for money for common investor],btohqsg
Generally  I guess so. But highly recommened that you spent several mintues reading their T&C,btohqsg
Does anybody know what will happen to your accrued interest resulted in using CPF OA to pay for your house loan when you reach the age of 55? If you hit FRS at age 55  can we withdraw our remaining money though the accrued interest is still outstanding?,btohqsg
