i actually had interview to prep for but chose to scroll through all my numerous jc chats,btohqsg
and actually in so doing  i read through my chem cher being so done about people in my class and then be like chasing for homework and asking people to buck up / seek consultation lmao,btohqsg
it is funny coz i think when i was in j2  i probably ignored those messages,btohqsg
'these are way overdue  please stay back tmr if you dont have cca. If you are struggling  I can stay back with you',btohqsg
For real at the very least we deserve student rates,btohqsg
I rmbr in south korea ppl in the military have like a separate door where they can enter the subway for free,btohqsg
They stay in for 2 years,btohqsg
But tbf i think we had it better,btohqsg
anyone enlist earlier than u can tekan u,btohqsg
How can they not be allowed to leave camp for 2 years at all though,btohqsg
I thought you meant they have to stay in camp for 2 years straight,btohqsg
But at least for the time theyâ€™re allowed to leave got free subway,btohqsg
Ok my bad its 18 months,btohqsg
Ya but my point is NSFs should have concession fares that are at least as low as student fares,btohqsg
The single fare trips are adult fares which is super expensive  and even the slightly discounted hybrid concession pass is more than 10% of my salary,btohqsg
Like at least our public transport is cheaper than most other developed countries around the world but like for NSFs given that our pay is measly we should have cheaper concession passes. Most working adults wonâ€™t be spending more than 10% of their salary on a monthly pass.,btohqsg
Maybe he can confirm if he had free public transport,btohqsg
lmao he actl can't catch a break ðŸ’€,btohqsg
