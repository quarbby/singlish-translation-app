Anyone know how apply vep to malaysia? I think the website is down :(,btohqsg
Took very long to register. Anyway u don't need it,btohqsg
Apply in April  baru received email last week,btohqsg
Best to try and apply and keep the confirmation of application ready to show to the police in case they stop you,btohqsg
I saw the signboard at ciq  they said vep not needed,btohqsg
Anyway they can change anytime. Bridge also jam everyday  lazy to go in,btohqsg
tuas until last month had boards saying apply for VEP now,btohqsg
but once you're in  you're at the mercy of the authorities on that end,btohqsg
Ok better confirm to collect then,btohqsg
by the time they email me  i changed car liao  i replied and ask do i need reapply or can just change the carplate in the application  for 1 month plus liao  still no response lol,btohqsg

I thought you pull rickshaw? Upgrade already ah?,btohqsg
Thing is  you can’t even really register for the VEP cause the portal for you to confirm and pay is not working LOL,btohqsg
Rickshaw cannot park at dorm sir. We keep our rickshaw in the warehouse,btohqsg
Yep yep. Passport can Liao for now but if you’re going in often do apply,btohqsg
