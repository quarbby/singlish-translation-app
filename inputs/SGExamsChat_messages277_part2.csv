if you have yearly TYS then you dont really need topical TYS tbh,btohqsg
HmmHow about ask your teacher to give you some practice papers topics by topics?My Chemistry and Math teachers gave us like that when I was in secondary school,btohqsg
If your teacher is unable to do so  then I would suggest you to continue with TYS  but do in a topical wayLike e.g. you want to do chapter 1  then find the questions related to chapter 1,btohqsg
