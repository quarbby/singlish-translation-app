Actually i see it as because of the scrap value at the end of 10yrs  if scrap value is half of the cost of the car then depreciation is lowerLoosely speaking  depreciation is the total loss (in paper value)  between how much you pay for on day 1 (either new car or the day you buy the used car) and what you will get back at the end of the car's 10th year  then divide by the in-between years.,btohqsg
