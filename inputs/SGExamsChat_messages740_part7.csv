Mine is the conditioner thats the issue tbh,btohqsg
my conditioner fucks up my hair somehow,btohqsg
then don't use conditioner try to use other hair products instead,btohqsg
there's always people like that  doesn't mean that's the majority,btohqsg
I mean in uni I was thinking everyone are in the same course alr it’s quite pointless to keep thinking about their jc days,btohqsg
The conditioner like drys everything out bruh idk how even,btohqsg
my hair be sleek then suddenly dry after conditioner,btohqsg
the ones that look down on others at that point are usually the insecure ones,btohqsg
I tried like 5 diff conditioners,btohqsg
can share with each other about pre u days lor thats like the maximum,btohqsg
sunsilk is out of the option,btohqsg
Especially if they’re alr in uni and all came in via their a level results. There’s rly no point of having a superiority complex. But if like a RI/HCI guy wants to comfort himself by thinking that he has a much better chance of doing better than someone from yi/mi  then sure lol,btohqsg
i mean bc my course cutoff is low  you get people from all sorts of places,btohqsg
my friend group had like people from JJC  diff poly  MJC all those,btohqsg
people who are genuinely interested and the ones that are here just to survive,btohqsg
now 3 of us doing phd  one going germany masters  one is NIE PGDE  one is SWE,btohqsg
Yea but I think musician was saying even past orientation there are still these ppl who must absolutely put others down in order to put themselves up,btohqsg
you're the only person in the other group that knows what a Hamiltonian is,btohqsg
its named after the f1 driver,btohqsg
then i think schrodinger was the name of some cat?,btohqsg
tbh my ori side was quite wholesome,btohqsg
Especially given that they all come in with similar a level results. As siyan illustrated  success is not final  failure is not fatal.,btohqsg
didn't really see much elitism in my batch itself,btohqsg
When musician grads with first class honours then they know,btohqsg
You be the next mi 90rp,btohqsg
but you know the idea of me doing a PhD and then people thinking wow i must have always been very smart,btohqsg
and then i whip out my a level results show them,btohqsg
i did not get A for econs liao,btohqsg
Ok at least try to aim for 3H2 A,btohqsg
also my first sem GPA was <4.0 in uni,btohqsg
i actually know of another TA who has done that also,btohqsg
his first sem gpa was like 3.6 or something,btohqsg
Btw for ppl taking 4H2 in MI  can they choose to take 1H2 in PU2?,btohqsg
no mi only offer 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
you're only allowed 3h2 in MI by default  idt there is an exception,btohqsg
Oh didn’t know he was from there too,btohqsg
I thought I saw on MI website 4H2 was offered,btohqsg
Hmm I guess I recalled wrongly,btohqsg
huh maybe that is for new batch?,btohqsg
it was like 3.9  4.6  3.9  4.8  4.6  5  5  5 for me,btohqsg
"idt so bah  MI's philosophy is since people who come in already ""cmi"" for jc  what for they take 4h2",btohqsg
but its 3h2 1h1 by default,btohqsg
you got 4.6 in y1s2? holy fk,btohqsg
Probably was thinking of one of the JCs,btohqsg
actually no what this year y1 also 3h2,btohqsg
Yeah so that’s why I said I saw the sch website wrongly. I just checked again,btohqsg
i supposed the 2nd 3.9 is when you got fked by CSA,btohqsg
i think i got A- for relativity  B+ for electricity  A for lab  A+ for calculus,btohqsg
i think linear algebra i took that them also for my batch,btohqsg
wait what batch are you whwn you grad from mi,btohqsg
