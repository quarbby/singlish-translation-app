Usually we change all tgt. If one dies means the other also lifespan shorten,btohqsg
I usually recommend change sparks and ignition coil tgt,btohqsg
I changed only when faulty  depends long left,btohqsg
That’s why i buy only short term cars n repeat. No need change so much. Just change the spoilt part with 2nd hand,btohqsg
But bro u think about it  when u get the car new  u have 4 coils when one dies  it means the other 3 went thru same mileage. If one give way means other 3 give way  if u replace 1 by 1  ur paying 4x the labour cost. Dont penny wise pound foolish,btohqsg
Ur ignition coil eg 45 bucks and u need 4. U replace 1 by 1  its 180 bucks with labour maybe 30 each time. Become 180+120=300 job.If u one shot do its only 180+30=210,btohqsg
Got some parts if interlinked might as well one shot  eg water pump and thermostat. Change one shunbian change the other. Save $$. Initial cost is higher but long runwise u save on labour.,btohqsg
Bro ur mentality more suitable to buy short term car,btohqsg
U may even get away with it by not changing n drive till scrap,btohqsg
Bro ur mentality more suitable to not own a car,btohqsg

i watched the sgcm review. seems quite lacking of features not gonna lie. no rear aircon nor sunroof,btohqsg

no clue. im not a mercedes boy sadly. maybe u should test drive haha,btohqsg
or u can check the mycarforum. probably got other people opinions too,btohqsg
100 your fault if u cross into others lane can cause accidents,btohqsg
Then if you cannot pay up how?,btohqsg
Sunroof is pretty useless in SG. I cannot tahan hot,btohqsg
Like you really have no money to pay up and have to declare to court you’re bankrupt.,btohqsg
That’s why police make you buy insurance. U know it’s illegal to drive without insurance. U can 100 claim but next year they can don’t insure u,btohqsg
If nobody willing to insure u. Sell car.,btohqsg
If you’re at fault and you don’t have money to pay claim. I tried finding online what to do liao,btohqsg
For a scenario like that GLA driver,btohqsg
Just ask the person to claim your insurance! I don’t understand simo pay claim? Pay excess u mean?,btohqsg
For my case  I cannot afford a claim,btohqsg
Omg how expensive? The most I saw is 2k,btohqsg
Declare bankruptcy for such matter is very silly.,btohqsg
Bankrupt liao u want to find job  buy house everything also tough,btohqsg

And above 15k then can bankrupt leh,btohqsg

Sorry la MG  I’m not that financially literate.,btohqsg
I just ask the person to claim my insurance if I cannot pay. I ever claim my headlamp and bumper 20k plus. Insurance full paid,btohqsg
Unless u tell me your insurance not comprehensive. Then up lorry liao,btohqsg
That means pay till I become penniless?,btohqsg
Sorry how old are u again? I think if not financially literate best is not drive. Driving is a money sucker in SG  only make you poorer that’s all.,btohqsg

Ahaha yeah I don’t really like the “jewel” box and v-shape door sides but I can understand the concept of creating a focus point,btohqsg
But I thought the M color only meant for X3 M50,btohqsg
totally my kind of look a d feel. hookedme immediately,btohqsg
not sure. when launch event come then go see. maybe avail on sports mode,btohqsg
Yeah that color is surely “M” colour,btohqsg
I got a M lite  so I know my “M”,btohqsg
was considering x1 m35 and this. decided to stick with zf8 and standard b48 layout,btohqsg
but based on this screenshot. the mirror not m style so we will find out again when launch event in nov or dec,btohqsg
maybe m sport trim have special this time,btohqsg
I didn’t get the 1x 35m because no iconic glow 😂 the iconic glow is a must if you getting the new generation of BMWs. It stands out at night,btohqsg
one of the reason also haha,btohqsg
guess u have the x2m35. too bad the rear headroom too low for my family. they mainly tall pple haha,btohqsg
This is the new standard Liao,btohqsg
U go check. I read a lot of reviews only x3 m50 get this interior color according to autogefuhl. But good to know if SG gets special,btohqsg
haha the m color thingy not a deal breaker,btohqsg
i like the interaction bar as a whole,btohqsg
And great if u like the dial. I now driving 3 series  I never use the dial at all.,btohqsg
Wonder when they will bring in the new 1 series,btohqsg
also around EOY  can preorder too liao also if im not wrong,btohqsg

If you're planning to have the VEP RFID delivered to your home to 'self-service' install. Their instructions are clear. It's on your headlight. Not windscreen of anywhere else. After installing it  you have to take photo to submit for approval before they activate it.Don't ask why at headlight  everyone is asking that same question every time.You might have option to install on windscreen if you make appoint to have them install it for you at the centre.,btohqsg
Alot ppl keep trying to game the system. See alr until sian,btohqsg
Normal. Cos they see tiktok of Malaysian putting the VEP RFID behind their front license plate. Malaysia Boleh mah  they can do what they want.When I did mine last year (self install)  I took photo and submitted but got rejected. I had to retake the photo and submit again.Some even suggested peeling it off and put it else where  bad idea cos you try to tamper with it  it will not work  the RFID circuit will break when you try to remove it. So don't be stupid and try to anyhow paste and think can relocated it.,btohqsg
Typical ma. Sgreans always like to act smart and don't follow instructions,btohqsg
Like tht 3 guy who challenge police at the cordon off area then now kana charge in court then now cry father crying mother,btohqsg
Now a lot Sgreans panic do last min registration cos they think Malaysia will uturn,btohqsg
Now Malaysia nvr uturn. All panic and start to make noise,btohqsg
Well  for the VEP case  you wait so long to get it delivered to you  do you want to risk relocating it after activating it? When it's broken  have to re-apply again.Personally  I find it stupid having the VEP RFID installed on the headlamp. If someone wants to sabotage you  just go up to it and peel it off. It's destroyed without you knowing.,btohqsg
Sg has VEP for the longest time for foreign vehicles,btohqsg
Cos ICA capture the plate and send to LTA,btohqsg
Malaysia just need to buy the VEP cash card,btohqsg
Even when ERP IU implemented  they also nvr force Malaysia car to install,btohqsg
Just tap ur VEP or buy Sg cash card and tap card at gantry,btohqsg
For Malaysians who work in SG  they will install the ERP IU for convenience and parking too.,btohqsg
They r given choices for convenience sake,btohqsg
Cos Sg know it will be chaos and create unnecessary problem,btohqsg
So they don't enforce installation of IU and make VEP a very simple process,btohqsg
Submit documents online  buy VEP cashcard,btohqsg
I would have loved it if Malaysia adopted the alternative  buy the RFID from petrol station  register it  self-install at windshield area (inside) to avoid it being tampered.,btohqsg
VEP tag to car and not person. Whoever drive in w tht car  responsible for that car,btohqsg
Smart tag  touch and go   now this rfid,btohqsg
TnG is ok. The RFID (non-VEP) version was also good for convenience when paying toll. Just drive thru.,btohqsg
RFID (non-VEP) was more flexible  but doesn't have tracking of vehicle should they require it. Cos it's just like TnG card  can 'pass to others' to use.,btohqsg
Actually if you look at it. You have to login your verified account to add your vehicle to the specific RFID Tag.So TnG RFID also got vehicle to owner tagging.,btohqsg
To that extend it's at TnG system side only. Same for the TnG card. But Gov will have to ask TnG system to pull out that system. Also  there is no strict regulations on the installation of the non-VEP RFID tag. Some plate it on a card and then put at windshield car-decal. Then later remove when not using or pass to someone who needs it. TnG system will show how much use and the other party just pay you back the amount.,btohqsg
Unfortunately got 2 sides. Do early stuck but no reply and like U said last min. But dont forget msia didnt had the capacity to handle the load in the first place,btohqsg
