I suddenly realise my viva in wk 14,btohqsg
at most all the % throw to finals only,btohqsg
samies i have 1 viva next monday,btohqsg
I get to put the weirdest photos in my lab report,btohqsg
and i think applied need to do lab in y3s1 sia,btohqsg
get it out of the way asap,btohqsg
I rather do in sem 2,btohqsg
not with 4 core mods next sem...,btohqsg
tbh the shit part about lab is just if you last min,btohqsg
bc actually doing the report is ok,btohqsg
im 4 out of 4 reports where i did it the day before till the next morning,btohqsg
6 hours non stop through the night HAHHA,btohqsg
for me i just do the instructions thingy gfirst,btohqsg
tbh that was me a lot too,btohqsg
i split into few nights tho towards the end,btohqsg
i think its a nice groove to just sit down and finish one shot la,btohqsg
but honestly idt its very healthy so,btohqsg
i skip intro and just jump to the procedures,btohqsg
first night map out all the points i wanna make like just sections and short points,btohqsg
second night the easy stuff like procedure intro etc,btohqsg
write the report while waiting for the exp to finish,btohqsg
last night results and discussion those,btohqsg
Refering to C1 and E5 cus they take so damn long,btohqsg
i even had to come back during cny lmao,btohqsg
i just went to eat lunch lmao,btohqsg
for me i rmb i was doing something,btohqsg
its time to cruise and await graduation alr,btohqsg
you still need to do physics electives,btohqsg
y3s1 is the last hardest sem we gotta ever do,btohqsg
idt they'll be as tough as our core mods,btohqsg
otherwise the seniors will look like dying,btohqsg
spms club ppl looked ok for the moment uh,btohqsg
but yea someone told me got someone stress uh so i pity them sometimes,btohqsg
lol i swear wk 13 is like hell week with like a lot of projects,btohqsg
this is my chillest week 13 ive ever had since matriculating lol,btohqsg
and lab report which was ok,btohqsg
i think cus i switch modes alr,btohqsg
i havent stay in hall for quite a while uh,btohqsg
but tbh i also dunno the point of staying in hall for y2s2,btohqsg
you have the more chill mods like computational physics,btohqsg
then you have the gu mile quantum info,btohqsg
i think the odds of me jumping down from spms rooftop is higher than me choosing gu mile's mod ever again,btohqsg
computational physics is no longer offered apparently,btohqsg
according to the ntu website now,btohqsg
a lot of phy mods being removed,btohqsg
computational physics is bc prof marco is leaving,btohqsg
but you know what they added?,btohqsg
"they added ""Geometric Methods in Mathematical Physics""",btohqsg
"omg i was so damn pissed when they removed ""Acoustics"" as a mod",btohqsg
oh yea also Fluid dynamics is removed also,btohqsg
