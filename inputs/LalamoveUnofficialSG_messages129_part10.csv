So between grab govan uparcel llm all these  which is best as a motorcycle rider?,btohqsg
Llm and uparcel good mix easier to stack cause both platforms you pick your own jobs. Grab assigns the job so harder to multi.,btohqsg
Govan very very very few orders for motorcycle. Can't be your main platform.,btohqsg
urpacel alone for van can earn $300 tommorrow ?,btohqsg
if i decide to drive a van. Can i just enter shopping mall loading bay easily for collection or delivery?,btohqsg
Just to avoid the hassle of the carpark,btohqsg
Yaâ€¦.but some malls have a differed charge for loading bay compared to carpark. Normally itâ€™s more.,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t you book for a car then?,btohqsg

Issit? But u ever do that?,btohqsg
Tried yesterday bt customer ask  me buy for him use my own money first because he choose cash payment..,btohqsg
This one not sure...mybe u can live chat with llm cs,btohqsg
No go bro. If customer never pay you will be huge cockup bro.,btohqsg
Ya that's why I ask him to  cancel the order,btohqsg
Call the number hp off...then ws me using +62 Indonesia number,btohqsg
Just now took one paid by creditðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Customer has to transfer the full amt u for the purchase  never unfront the payment  for them or top up whatever card.Llm did mentioned in the video training  do not proceed the order if customer refuse to pay before purchase. But some gundos still fall for it.,btohqsg
I let the cus know about this..bt he keep on saying that one if only cus on paynow mode,btohqsg
Tell cus u no money ask him/her to cancel the order. Don't waste time with these people,btohqsg
Think if got Xar Park chargez can ask but Depends if pax want pay?,btohqsg
Yap. AGREE. Cos if you buy and they DENY. You suck thumb and Waste your own moniez. Some are Loan Shark cases too. So Best NOT to take such Buy thingz job,btohqsg
Hi new bird here  may I know can we take 2 orange order at the same time?,btohqsg
Now or scheduled? If you wanna stack  at your own risk. If customer complains  you better have a solid answer. Donâ€™t give a peak period jam or traffic jam excuse. Expired excuses liao.,btohqsg
Customer are paying peanuts and donâ€™t want us to stack,btohqsg
Riders  this can take? About 5kg,btohqsg
Got once i tio really PIE accident massive jam  CS want me to stoo roadside take photo and as another driver come take,btohqsg
In the end donate half of fee to llm ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg

Yeah 1st time kena didnt notice the 40km/h. Always tell myself not to take sentosa LLM but today hand itchy,btohqsg
then dont worry will kena warning only. Just wait for letter and appeal online.,btohqsg
Luckily you exceed 11km/hr is within the ok range,btohqsg
above 20 is straight fine and demerit,btohqsg
Hahah i only notice the white small flashes aft i passed then i knew i kena already,btohqsg
Customer also choose to stay all the way inside need to cruise at 40 ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Normally u all do one by one or stack. Because feel that one by one safer than do stack.,btohqsg
So far i 1 by 1 still noob havenâ€™t do stack yet,btohqsg
Depends what item and how far,btohqsg
Because I not van is car and part time not full time so should be ok.,btohqsg
