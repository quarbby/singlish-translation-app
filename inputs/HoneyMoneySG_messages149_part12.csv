Very easy to hack. Either use computer to brute force or when you use it in shops  the staff takes a picture of it will do.You did lock the card when not using it or set it to empty wallet ?,btohqsg
first 6 digit is issuer and bank identification number  only the 7th - 15th is your actual 'random number'  16th is the checksumoh and the ccv is not required for some retailer  expiration doesn't proof anything  your card generally expire in 2-5 years at most  how many number is that,btohqsg
I use amaze card more sequence.,btohqsg
hi bro ..can we include incoming salary credit together with save as well?,btohqsg
Sorry I must ask a rude question. Do u do anything potentially suspicious for them to “ban” you?Like frequent refunds? Withdrawal? Or suspicious merchant types?,btohqsg
Yes but always best to keep it to as close as 500 increment MAB.,btohqsg
I also curious.. this case I won't even say rare  but one of a kind.Other suspicious activity I can think of is having physical transactions at different merchants within short period of time (5 mins?).,btohqsg
thinking of applying with my new company..ask them credit salary here ..alamak... then when salary comes in  a few K...u mean ...faster shift out the amount right?,btohqsg
sorry mel.. I'm still searchiing up history and reading up...as not to re-ask frequent question,btohqsg
If you are doing it yourself the salary transfer you properly know the exact date it is in. Why not just set a scheduled transfer out as well. That way the MAB is certain to be $500.,btohqsg
Doesn't matter how you do it as long MAB increment by $500. Best way is to withdraw all salary credit while deposit on 1st day.,btohqsg
eh? 360 can also self paynow sala like one account? i'm currently on 1 account,btohqsg
"What do you mean by ""doing it yourself""? Salary credit?",btohqsg
i always transfer out the salary on the day itself.,btohqsg
oh ...ok....then set transfer out same day as new company's payday lor...hehe...thanks thanks u!,btohqsg
Yes. He mentioned he creating a company to transfer himself the salary.,btohqsg
What's a good card after maxed out citi amaze card.,btohqsg
He did not mention that. He mentioned applying for the account and get salary credited from his new company.,btohqsg
who? me? ya...my new job AKA new company..lol..not DIY one..haha,btohqsg
Without do anything. No refunds  withdrawal and suspicious merchant before. Some more this unauthorized transaction also don't have to credit to my account  since when transaction is general automatically rejected  since i unable the remittance function.,btohqsg
Guys  if we were to pay via Atome 3 months 0%  only the first payment is considered eligible spend right?,btohqsg
This unauthorized transaction is remittance  not a in-store merchant,btohqsg
2nd and 3rd payments are eligible spend too.,btohqsg
This amaze card i just add to my GPay for transport like bus and train traveling use and go to supermarket for mobile contactless use. No more other.,btohqsg
I read and read but still cannot find out what you meant...Not sure your remittance is money in or money out  you stated no money in Amaze wallet  so I suppose it's money in.You originally stated Amaze card  now you say Amaze wallet...,btohqsg
what type of transactions are you going to charge to this 2nd cc card?,btohqsg
I read already blur blur also.,btohqsg
Dining. If can travel related good.but if cannot nvm,btohqsg
At least block it from oversea use.,btohqsg
I’m new to cardup and I have an insurance lumpsum urgent payment of $5k+  if I want to earn miles. Which card should I be using?On Heymax  it recommended UOB one card but then I’m in my 2nd month of a quarter and my previous month  I spent $800 so I won’t get effective 3.33% cashback…Should I use Citi Premier Miles  or Citi Rewards or DBS WW?—>How does cardup work  Is it if my insurance company need to receive $5k  I must use1 cardto pay $5k?—>Or card up breaks it down into $5k installment for me to pay via card?,btohqsg
If that's how OP also provided info to Amaze CSO  I really not surprised if Amaze permanently suspend the account. The story don't tally  makes it even more suspicious than any kind of fraudulent transaction...,btohqsg
CardUp transactions are not eligible for UOB One card.You can split to multiple transactions for insurance premiums  but some promo codes are limited to one or two usages. So plan well.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I mention is amaze card  no wallet,btohqsg
Hey all  can you use Amex True Cashback for travel insurance / normal insurance payments (and get cashback on it)? Thanks! :)EDIT: I saw the exclusion list and it seems like insurance is not excluded. But it does say the list is non-exhaustive,btohqsg
Can use and get cashback  but whether they accept Amex is another thing. Don’t know many providers (if any) that do accept,btohqsg
I also want to know  but they don't tell me just say they policy,btohqsg
That is very strange. Usually those fraudulent transactions are from oversea online transactions.,btohqsg
Good news - can topup TnG with IChange new card,btohqsg
So when the transaction is general immediate rejected.,btohqsg
The question is  does the insurance provider accept AMEX as payment provider? Are you going to hunt that 1 or 2 insurance provider for that miniscule cashback? What if other insurance companies offer you same/better coverage at the cheaper price (cheaper than the cashback given)?,btohqsg
yes  the transaction i show use my amaze to remittance.,btohqsg
so they asked me to apply thru their email and attach my relevant documents.wpndering if anyone applied thru email before and how long does it take for a reply?,btohqsg
If fast it's 1-3 business days  normal it's 3-5 business days and slow it's 5-7 business days. If you want the card just submit the documents  you'll receive the reply when you receive it.,btohqsg
Anyone else has any other suggestion,btohqsg
Hi  if I had sold a put option (expiring 17Jan in the money) on moomoo and would like to roll to a later period  do I buy back the put option (with the same strike price and expiry date) to close off the put option that I've sold - and then sell another one with later expiry date?,btohqsg
Close the one you own. Sell another one. U can also just treat it as 2 different trade.,btohqsg
"what u mean by ""Amaze to remittance"". Can do remittance using Amaze card?",btohqsg
Send money to overseas bank account from your Paynow bank account using Amaze service.,btohqsg
he mentioned fraudulent transactions on Amaze card though.,btohqsg
