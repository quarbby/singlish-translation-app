"May i know oversea spending in any area/retail is it under ""travel"" category from uob lady soli?",btohqsg

I have a specific query regarding CPF and taking out loansCurrently  I am self-employed and have already been making contributions to my CPF Medisave. I am contemplating a voluntary top-up to my CPF account  mainly because I'm looking into the possibility of taking out a personal/house/credit card loan in the near future.I wanted to ask:- Does having a higher balance in my CPF account  due to voluntary top-ups  have any positive impact on my eligibility or the terms I might receive for such loans?- Would you recommend a CPF top-up in my case as a strategic move before applying for these loans  or would it not make much of a difference?,btohqsg
1. Loan quantum is based on income and credit history  not much in CPF balance. Though more OA is useful to pay and reduce the loan required.2. Only do CPF top-up when you need the tax relief  not for loans,btohqsg
any cons for Citi Reward + amaze?spend 2.5k monthly can get 10k miles,btohqsg

I found this website is quite useful. Many people benefits from it. You can try to search usinghttps://heymax.ai,btohqsg
What is interest rate for 100k in uob one account? How much interest will be deposited into the one account monthly . Which I have completed the 2 requirements.,btohqsg
Ok. Isn't it said up to 7.8%. For 100k.,btohqsg
7.8% for the $75 001 to $100 000. eir is 5% for the 100k,btohqsg
Its like income tax. Not the mWhole 100k gets 7.8%,btohqsg
Hi Everyone  I have a sensitive question about CPF payments from employer to employee.any gurus well versed in cpf conflict resolutions?,btohqsg
can anyone advise how citipayall works? i have to pay for a rent online in foreign currency for 3 months. (arnd 2.2k sgd per month) should I use citipayall to earn miles?,btohqsg
Cimb for new customer also 6months 3.5% only. Wouldn't tbill be a better choice?,btohqsg
I remember Mouse Hunter remember someone asked this question before.,btohqsg
how do i search it up pls,btohqsg
T bill money is lock  CIMB money more flexible and liquid,btohqsg
Eh then if I'm earning more than 102k annually. The max amount that will attract CPF contribution is only 102k. And with the increment of the OW ceiling to 8k  means effectively I take home less each month as the 8k will be subjected to deductions and employer contribution is capped at 102k. Doesn't that make it essentially a pay cut? Can I think about it that way?,btohqsg
No difference actually. Because when u get your bonus  u will get more cash than previously (assuming bonus amount unchanged compared to the past).,btohqsg
I see thanks. They should really increase the annual ceiling. Increasing the OW to 8k makes no difference tbh,btohqsg
We actually had some analysis of this. There is actually one group that would benefit.Those earning between $6-8k with bonus under $30k to under $6k respectively.Because this group never hit the $102k annual wage ceiling  with the changes they actually get more cpf contributions from employer (net gain).,btohqsg
Hi useing citi payall for my rent I juz read about cardup  juz to check with u all which payment can earn more miles point?,btohqsg
For cardup  you can use this website to check.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculatorFor citi payall  login to Citi apps n choose Citi payall  it calculates and shows you the miles/points you will earn before your make final submission if it is non promo.,btohqsg
Isit more wroth it to use cardup than ciit payall?,btohqsg
Provided you use cardup promo code.,btohqsg
Unless you have no bonus at all,btohqsg
For unsecured loans the credit rating agency have no access to CPF  they only care about your source of income and existing debts if any.for housing loan the banks and HDB have access to CPF,btohqsg
Hi  just opened a UOB one account last month. Managed to spend the min 500sgd and credit salary. Believed that the bonus interest will be credited the first day of next month  which is yesterday but I don‚Äôt see the interest being credited. Is there anywhere to check?,btohqsg

Yeah.For my lazy household members  I usually get them to use amaze so I can switch the linked MasterCard for them in the background.Amaze does not change the mcc of the merchant although it makes all transactions online (only upside no downside in my opinion),btohqsg
Thanks for this! Was worried that there may be some downside restrictions  but based on your explanation I dont think there is any üëçüèª,btohqsg
Only cards like uob krisflyer which rely on merchant name (amaze messes that up) u need to be careful.,btohqsg

Comparison for qualification is based on last day of the month.Payment of interest is 3.5%pa of average monthly balance.,btohqsg
I think you will get 3.5% interest of the $95k for one day only. About $9.10.The rest of the day you will get 3.5% for $1k.Sorry mistake. Your month end balance is ($1k x 29 days + $95k)/30days= $4133.33 (less than $5k)You get base bonus only. üòÇ,btohqsg

Thanks. I think the worst thing that will happens is get 1.2 KrisFlyer miles per S$1 spend for other spend rather than 3,btohqsg
My dad is the same age as yours. His time is still under the MMS (i did not convert for him to CPF Life).So whatever he has inside in RA  CPF will try to disburse the monies inside upon him reaching 85.However  i am transferring to him via my OA at the end of each year so that i top back up to the same level he has started. (This way he can use it as a high yield ATM.machine which credits his bank acc for his use on monthly basis)I do it via OA  as i am making use of the int from OA to defray some of my cash outflow to him as a monthly pension for him.,btohqsg
Hello experts  I have a question. I'm 36yo with 23k in OA and 105k in SA. Should I move my OA to SA to capitalise on the 4% interest to grow the money? No interest in investing anywhere else at the moment.,btohqsg
Not really. 1.2 mpd is not the worst. If the oversea merchants have monkey mcc code  especially in Japan  they like to use Utilities mcc code  you will end up getting nothing. ie. zero mile.,btohqsg

The 1st 20k in OA will earn 3.5%.  Take note that once OA is transferred to SA  there is no way to reverse it. If you want to transfer  suggest to do for the 3k.,btohqsg
Wa.. Sounds like their processes not very efficient,btohqsg
So i should keep 20 k in the OA and then move anything over it to SA?,btohqsg
Im just trying to maximize growth for RA. I don't have any morgage so all my cpf contribution from now is purely for retirement,btohqsg
My OA and SA contributions on total are Bout 38k/yr.. Bit more now cause medisave hit max already,btohqsg
No need to keep 20k if you have no use for it. Since your combined balances are already over $60K  it will earn the max 1% additional interest. Do note of the irreversible nature.As Mouse Hunter has mentioned  you may watch this video to decidehttps://youtu.be/te9o1hJWDig?si=Nxr9Z2pQ4daEbEkO,btohqsg

If i use amaze card  are these fees still charged? Any better way to pay in restaurants in australia besides cash?,btohqsg
common in Australia. Charged on top of bill,btohqsg
This is actually a very good question.From my experience with DEBIT CARDS like Amaze in Australia:1. If the terminal is programmed properly (no staff intervention)  debit cards like Amaze will not attract any fee if the rule is CREDIT CARDS pay 2% for example.2. However if it is a staff intervention entry  they may still add on 2% charge manually for you whether you use Debit or Credit card (either they don't care or they don't know the difference).,btohqsg
Hi all  I booked a fully refundable booking in Airbnb using DBS CC  but the charges for the initial payment and the refund amount is off by a few dollars. Any idea whether I can ask DBS to pay the difference(likely due to currency) or just absorb the difference? Thanks!,btohqsg
So it got really stupid...If I use:1. Amaze + UOB krisflyer = I pay AUD50 for example2. UOB krisflyer = I pay AUD51 for example,btohqsg
Oh i see! Rarely itll be manually operated i suppose. Seems like bringing cash is the way to go? What about other places like malls or small vendors that have credit card terminals?,btohqsg
NO NO NO Australia never use cash unless there is CASH DISCOUNT.Even if there is credit card surcharge  by using the correct cashback/miles cards  you will still have a net positive gain compared to cash.Manually operated could be those mum and pop diners..Bill is AUD50.. you say you pay with EFTPOST.. you pay AUDyou pay with credit  cashier presses AUD51 for you to paywave,btohqsg

after saw the chris new best dca video  if want to switch to ibkr.should we keep our stocks in existing broker ? or sell itwhat is the best way ?,btohqsg
I have the same problem.If you monitor your portfolio as a whole  then switching is better  since your selling action (and gain/loss) is captured.If you monitor based on each stock/ETF  then you will see the gain/loss your new stock/ETF in IBKR starting from the date you transfer. Then the long term performance may be different. In addition  switching to different broker will incur additional fee.For my case  I'll maintain existing one  stop the existing RSP  and switch new RSP via IBKR. The downside is you got so many stocks/platform to monitor.My 5 cent. Wait for other's advice and insight.,btohqsg
thanks for the opinion  ya same concern to me,btohqsg

yes  no fall below fee. But u still need to fulfil the total relationship balance which I assume is transfer $15k as salary monthly (can transfer out),btohqsg
u mean the credit card? yes is on apple pay . i use it on a daily basis,btohqsg

Hi all  I intend to charge in-store purchase through Kris+ to Google Pay which is linked to UOB Evol. Is that considered online or contactless? ü§î,btohqsg
that card i'm absolutely not sure about it lol. i dun have that card lol,btohqsg
Good for insurance and transport I guess,btohqsg
transport i think UOB One CC better haha,btohqsg
Provided if insurance allow payment using AMEX,btohqsg
using apple pay on shopee counted as online or contactless ? or contactless just means paywave?,btohqsg
I see rebate for transport 1.7% for UOB Aboslute  but N/A for UOB ONE.,btohqsg
UOB One CC got extra cashback for simplygo and also for grab... so yeah,btohqsg
Contactless means you tap your card or phone against a terminal and it beep beep,btohqsg
Transport as PHV or bus/MRT? For bus/MRT cannot tap AMEX cards (UOB Absolute is AMEX),btohqsg
I think UOB One higher. 3.33% +5% if u hit min spend haha,btohqsg
Got diff cat for min spend? Very high le like that wow,btohqsg
min spend for UOB one is by tier de ... $500/1000/2000,btohqsg

Does anyone know what is trust bank and youtrip foreign currency spread?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have so no idea  maybe someone can answer,btohqsg
generally around 0.8% off spot  you can use the mc/visa currency converter pages to get an exact amount,btohqsg
But u still need to hit the monthly 800 spend requirement,btohqsg
I see. Does the Malaysia ringgit count towards the $800 minimum spending?,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm currently holding a EP in Singapore and planning to apply CIMB visa signature. According to the T&C of singsaver reward promotion  it stated all residents in Singapore includes citizen  PR  working pass holder are eligible to the sign up bonus. However when singsaver directed me into another link to CIMB website for the application of credit card  CIMB website shows the eligibility for CIMB visa signature is only Singaporean and PR.,btohqsg
if working pass holder is not eligible to the credit card application (according to CIMB website)  then how would the pass holder eligible for the singsaver sign up promoüòÖ,btohqsg
you dont need to set aside 20k if you want to transfer to sa,btohqsg
20k is required if you plan to get HDB loan.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/using-your-cpf-to-buy-a-home/retain-20000-in-your-oa-if-you-are-taking-a-housing-loan#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20to%20manage earn%20attractive%20risk%2Dfree%20interest.,btohqsg

If its top up to SA and MA for tax relief . go to CPF web ( not app) > my cpf > retirement > scroll down to tax relief,btohqsg
How to get free credit bureau report? When I access  it always direct me to HSBC free report.,btohqsg
Valid within your last CC application outcome + 1 month,btohqsg
All banks did not access my  report when they approved my CC application. I have to go thru HSBC route.,btohqsg
Citibank application will give u free report. Go prestige!,btohqsg
In the CB site  Click on ‚Äòbuy report‚Äô if it‚Äôs free it would churn you one if it s not you have to input payment details,btohqsg
I applied Citi prestige n got approved. Citi did not access my report too.,btohqsg
The report would be accessed when take a car loan or housing loan as well,btohqsg
CB website asks me to pay or contact HSBC for free report. HSBC gave me an invalid code to access my report. At the end  I can‚Äôt access.,btohqsg
Very strange. All my humans get free report after prestige.Only uob never get free.,btohqsg
Should not be a code. Cb website should auto give u free.,btohqsg
When I clicked proceed  it direct me to payment page  and eventually I need to enter my credit card details for payment.,btohqsg
