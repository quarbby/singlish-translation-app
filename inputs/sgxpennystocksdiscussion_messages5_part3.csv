I not going to commit too much to medical stocks,btohqsg
1.Its too easy to push down medical stocks recently.Just a simple vaccine news can easily see 10-20% drop on a single day2. Many retailers are skeptical of medical stocks BBs can apply full pressure and press down also3. Gone are the days when you see medical stocks fly,btohqsg
This is for short term play,btohqsg
Buy this  sure make money. Go go,btohqsg
But MT play is similar to the one time it was suppressed at 0.9x for a while with low volume also,btohqsg
Maybe just maybe got one last hurrah again,btohqsg
And to add on MT is proven with solid results,btohqsg
Else have to find exit plan,btohqsg
If compared to some of the more speculative plays,btohqsg
Which I won't name if not kena aimed,btohqsg
Not vested better don't say other counters,btohqsg
Oo .. hope we have a good MT day ahead tomorrow üòÅ,btohqsg
I hope found its bottom at 1.2 la,btohqsg
It was stuck at 1.6 for a while also,btohqsg
Buy and average down to keep for mid term .. should be good,btohqsg
He probably wan to squeeze out 1 for his reelection chances,btohqsg
If a real and effective vaccine is really produced and released worldwide I wonder how will market react,btohqsg
Best effect for his reelection is 2-3 weeks before the election date,btohqsg
Confirm got knee jerk reaction one,btohqsg
I am trying to see this from a neutral perspective,btohqsg
Not being overly bullish or bearish,btohqsg
All med stocks doesn't look promising...,btohqsg
I can't think of any news that can propel the stocks to new highs again,btohqsg
But the fact is medtech is earning way more... Why will still trigger drop?,btohqsg
Unless it's a spectacular results that cannot be predicted by the market,btohqsg
Maybe clement yang got something up his sleeve loh,btohqsg
Try not to chase this period,btohqsg
Death count reach 1 million ?,btohqsg
Too eager to reopen economy and get second and third waves,btohqsg
Actually everyone needs to calm down and take a good solid look at each of the glove or med counters they are vested in  how much they had multiplied since january. Some counters are grossly overinflated honestly. The growth isnt sustainable and everyone knows that. Maybe it could save u some money to take a hit and cut loss now instead of holding out for a miracle. Just shedding some light and opinion.,btohqsg
FYI I am vested in MT and VP but short term one la.So I not trying to create fear,btohqsg
Just looking at it in a neutral perspective,btohqsg
Got the feeling China will produce vaccine first. US has to go through many clearance before it can be marketed,btohqsg
But tomorrow MT goes up to 1.4 all talk differently le,btohqsg
Now market heavily swayed by sentiments lah  so nobody can really tell where it will go next,btohqsg
I cannot find the breaking news about trump and vaccine in weeks,btohqsg
The movement is not upwards it's always sell down rebound,btohqsg
Try saying that to Tesla.. But everyone need to set a SL point  live to fight another day...,btohqsg
Chill guys not the end of the world,btohqsg
Disruptive technologies usually justifies a more explosive growth  especially with tesla‚Äôs and specifically elon musk‚Äôs track record and reputation. If u wan to compare tesla‚Äôs growth  look at apple when they launch iphone,btohqsg
BB want goreng any stocks we can't expect it also one,btohqsg
Ya old news  but there is the link u wanted,btohqsg
My point is any vaccine related news all will be worried,btohqsg
But on the other side there's no other good news to spike up the price,btohqsg
Exactly! They will do anything to trap retailers to buy high sell low,btohqsg
Eh the picture not i share de  dunno why the person shared old news either,btohqsg
Anyway i‚Äôm not here to spread fear or what  but advising everyone to see the bigger picture to make more informed decisions. DYODD,btohqsg
U bought how many wat price?,btohqsg
Aspen factory piling works beginning 21/9,btohqsg
Today market consider ok ma.. Y so many argument lol,btohqsg
