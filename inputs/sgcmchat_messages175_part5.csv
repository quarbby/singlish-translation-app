Etiquette to car meets:1. Run after cars that are limited edition! You donâ€™t want to miss a shot2. Feel free to sit on the cars  and inside the cars! Just open the door  the owners have unlocked the car for you3. Be sure to feel free to touch the cars! These cars can be touched because they have all been detailed and ceramic coated. You can feel the difference!4. Donâ€™t forget to connect with others. See a girl you like? Flirt with her and exchange instagram! Later can make TikTok together!,btohqsg
