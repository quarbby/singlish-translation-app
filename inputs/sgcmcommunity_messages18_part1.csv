I love this statement; One does not simply cut a Subaru WRX STI!,btohqsg
Eh sia la. So many app notifications from our competitor.,btohqsg
corvette is under Chevrolet rite... damn rare here never saw b4,btohqsg
Chevy RHD market is quite small,btohqsg
Also their gearbox tech is very old and their forte is big engines and big cars as per the middle eastern and north American markets. These vehicles don't do too well in Asian markets usually. Sometimes a few models do decent like the Cruze but the company didn't update it enough so they died,btohqsg
big cc is a killer here... rd tax so exp. Europe aso.. that's y small cars are more common on the streets there.,btohqsg
Just watched the video  the Polestar 2 is driver seat is actually suppose be set abit closer and higher for it to be more comfortable. the seat mold would actually not made to be sat so far like in the video where the seat looked quite far away from the steering wheel.,btohqsg
the traditional american car makers all like that... ford tried to enter the european eco market but too late,btohqsg
despite the newer ford focus being quite good,btohqsg
in Europe smaller cars are common more because of the congestion charges and space constraints as most need to park by the road most of the time,btohqsg
Ford is actually doing quite well in Europe,btohqsg
with the focus  transit and fiesta,btohqsg
well is subjective  on the  road you still see mostly european  brands though,btohqsg
The Kia Sportage and Ford Puma are actually two of the top 3 selling cars in the UK,btohqsg
But I agree  VAG cars do rule the european markets  tend to see them more,btohqsg
many keep them for a longer time as maintenance is cheaper there,btohqsg
in italy and france their own brands also see more loyalty from their nationals,btohqsg
Ford Focus is actually a European product  not US lol,btohqsg
pretty sure some Kia and Hyundai models also being made in europe,btohqsg
but why huh. wouldn't it be cheaper to produce in Korea,btohqsg
or they produce in Eastern Europe. cheaper...,btohqsg
Hyundai also producing EV in Sg ... I aso duno why...,btohqsg
Cause our goverment tried hard to get them here to produce ev so got job for sinkie,btohqsg
Then sinkie will said down with foreigner,btohqsg
When they build the cars here there will be investment in R&D,btohqsg
