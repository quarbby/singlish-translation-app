But of course some people may decide on the spot  so it may delay next person(s) appointments,btohqsg
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄ got plans to use ikea. But still need to research more on it,btohqsg
Is there any way of knowing which units are akr selected prior to our window/selection so we can prepare ?,btohqsg
Yes  there's a live page on flat portal,btohqsg
They open it up about 2 weeks before I think,btohqsg
When this is released  you can also see unit prices,btohqsg
Yup! Thanks for sharing this image,btohqsg
Like  open it up for us only 2 weeks prior to our selection date?,btohqsg
Nope  before all selection starts. This timeline is just a gauge,btohqsg

Oh so no ballot number results de ah? For that email?,btohqsg
Base on my experience   2 weeks times result will release .,btohqsg
helloo does anyone know for hfe supporting documents  my gf and i are currently both ft students. Which documents should I be submitting? since theres the cbs report  bank statements etc.,btohqsg
In theory  no. If 80% chinese quota of 260 means 208 chinese quota only. If everyone before u is a chinese and everyone selects  then your 233 queue cannot selectbut in real life  yes. A lot of ppl will drop out and not everyone is a chinese too,btohqsg
hi how did you navigate to this page?,btohqsg
Priority scheme is for those with child or elderly?,btohqsg
hi all  need some advice here.anybody know about the 2 room flats for elderly. can just call hdb or check if there are available ones within a specific area?,btohqsg
Sms indicate Step 3 View Application Details.  Only see this,btohqsg
ok thanks! maybe i will check on the open booking. i saw the open booking but it seems hardly open for booking :/,btohqsg
obf is leftover from sbf  so u have to wait for ppl to finish selecting for sbf first then obf will openobf is not a 24/7 thing,btohqsg
Just wondering  for shortlease 2Rm  if the flat is returned to HDB for whatever reason (eg death) after being lived in for a few years  which category will such flats be classified under? Repossessed flats? And how will they be offered to the public again  SBF or OBF ?,btohqsg
Got a curious qn.If person A has an out of supply queue no. for oct 2023 but a within supply queue no for dec 2023  gets called up for Oct 2023  is he/she able to reject the Oct 2023?,btohqsg
Will it be considered a rejection and affect dec 2023 queue no.?,btohqsg
Is there still obf these days? Sbf also hard to get. Oversubscribed,btohqsg
Sbf limited supply thats why oversubscribe more compare to bto,btohqsg
You rejectYour second Q number will be cancel and become second timer for a yearOr you put it cold down period for a. Year can't select any BTO SBFOnly resale,btohqsg
Only when HDB inform you no need to come due to some reason then you are saved,btohqsg
I mean ive been trying to apply sbf since 2022 but never get. Obf also never get notificition of launch these days. Maybe its a thing prior 2022,btohqsg
Yeah. Sbf use to be 2 times a year. Then they screw up last year. No sbf in nov 2023. Damn,btohqsg
You can reject Oct 2023 bto only if total number of units left is 10 <When is your turn,btohqsg
Please go to correct group .,btohqsg

Want to know hdb loan eligibility is based on salary when signed lease or key collection. Its could be 5years apart and applicants salary can be folds up since signed lease.,btohqsg
As long as you can settle the unit price in full on the appointment before key collection  you‚Äôre good to go.,btohqsg
During HFE application will tell you how much HDB loanOn first appointment will tell you about how much is your loan and everything ( more or less confirm)3 months before key collection just to see if you can repay the loan than HDB will processElse HDB loan maybe cancel you have to come out with cashIf not cash you can't collect key,btohqsg
No increase of load at key collection,btohqsg
HFE is not existing in 2021 when the time i signed lease.,btohqsg
3 months before key collection got another check? Are u sure? Is it based on ur self experience?,btohqsg
What happen to your downpayment that u had paid?,btohqsg
Can only answer base on what I knowFor official answer best look for HDB,btohqsg
Thanks  i think better ask hdb too.,btohqsg
Some say they will reassess is still case by case  End of the day just choose the unit within your means dont over commit unless u got extra spare cash in place,btohqsg
My concern now is i may over qualified for hdb loan,btohqsg
As long during the application  u are not is fine,btohqsg
I think this answered me if valid,btohqsg
End of the day if u can't bto is a good problem also,btohqsg
Aiya 1 of the people will resign because they over 14K ceiling then apply and book a hdb firstMy couple friend example: he ask her wife resign first and apply BTO  once book already wife go back to find job. So once u secure the flat booking paid the options fees done.After your income over 14K also no issue liao,btohqsg
Try to contact the admin for Acres?,btohqsg
Based on what i heard around so far  few months prior to key collection  there will be a renewal or final review of sortTo find out if there have been adverse changes to incomeDoubt loan eligibility will be cancelled but the amount eligible will be decreased,btohqsg
Should be based on time of applicationNearing key collection  supposedly> if income decreased - loan amount will be lowered> if income increased - loan amount stays the same,btohqsg
You don't have to apply for HFE since you belong to the HLE batchIn fact  don't really have to do anythingHDB will contact you when nearing key collection,btohqsg
Hopefully I can save enough money in my cpf liddat I no need take loan lol,btohqsg
Is it possible to ballot for another bto if u get a que number from previous launch?,btohqsg
If que not within the supply. Can?,btohqsg
Does anyone know what will happen to parent hdb if they pass away? Can the chidren still stay and change ownership?,btohqsg
Both or any one parties ?,btohqsg
If child has own hdb  have to dispose either one. If don‚Äôt have then will inherit,btohqsg
Based on my understanding any 1 parties pass on the ownership will pass to thenext owner fully,btohqsg
If both pass on and there isnt any wills of inheritage HDB will interfer,btohqsg
They must inherit to u  meansnu become co owner  me too is like this but i get my own BTO then my MOM go law firm to put a will to sell the hdb and distribution the money equally to me and my 2 other slibings. If i die before my mom  my share will be to my son,btohqsg
When i get my own BTO I remove my name from my existing parents hdb as co owner,btohqsg
Ok tq. So if got 4 siblings  the hdb will be equally be put co-own by 4 names is it? What if 1 sibling waiting for a bto to complete?,btohqsg
If HDB take over they will put the house up for sales then share the amount equally to 4,btohqsg
But if there is wills  wills wills overright all decision,btohqsg
So better check previously did any one parties of your parent wrote a wills before,btohqsg
Or any siblings holding on to any wills,btohqsg
Ok. thank you for the answer. I will need to check. Islamic faraid is consider a will right?,btohqsg
I wouldnt know would it consider  as i am chinese my friend,btohqsg
And we only believe in law firm,btohqsg
Resign also no use cause its last 14mon income... Unless don't work for the last 14month then ur loan amt also go down,btohqsg
My concern not on the bto eligibility but more on hdb loan eligibility as my family gross income will slightly exceed $14k when in the key collection year. Hdb loan will give me more flexibility when want to pay off all remaining loan when i sold my existing flat. Not sure if hdb allow case by case consideration on this scenario.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine. Eligibility for HDB Loan is locked in already at the point of flat application,btohqsg
I was talking about loan eligibilityBased on time of applicationOnly if your income is lower when nearing key collection  as compared to when you signed your lease  there should be a concern,btohqsg
Wa u sure or not i mean the slibings don't get BTO meh ? Haha . I won't even want to be co own by my parents house because u are considered like u have a hdb and your chance of getting a Q number is slim.When i remove my name then i get a Q number. The first 3 tries all out of Q,btohqsg
Anyways just do a will la. Everyone's fair share . If never do will in the end fighting for the house for what  relationship spoiled,btohqsg
Unless your parents and your slibings already talked about whoever never get house go co own the current parents house. Then the other slibings is okay w that get their own house done,btohqsg
Ya. I think 2-3 sibling can co own. I already wait for bto. So no need to put my name. Just want to be clear about can inherit or not.,btohqsg
Yes correct. I did not mention this . Just out of job more then half a year and apply . Hdb will see u 6 months already out of job totally or just working part time can try to apply already  last time can now need 1 yr playlip not sure can or not,btohqsg
My mom have a hdb nowMy other 2 slibings and me already gotten BTO  last is me waiting for keys collectionAnd my mom already went to law firm with us 3 to the law firm the house sale proceed is spilt equally among the 3 of usHopes this help. But im not sure if no wills what will happen to the flat la,btohqsg
Can is can  but they still will see ur last 14mon income pattern...,btohqsg
Cue promotion for insurance agent with Will Management expertise üòÇ time to get new client,btohqsg
Im HLE batch not HFE. HLE era will reassess loan eligibility before key collection. Not sure if now in HFE era  our HLE batch will follow HLE or HFE practice.,btohqsg
Thanks  that why i doubt if HDB will case by case consider my case.,btohqsg
Seniors are not restricted from getting 99 years lease for their 2R unitSuch as  because they want to leave the flat for their child(ren),btohqsg
Just let HDB contact you first for the review or renewal before you try to appeal anything  perhaps?Loan eligibility should be based on the time of application / lease signingJust make sure that your income is not lower than before  as it would be perceived as a decreased ability to repay the loan and thus loan amount eligible will also be lowered,btohqsg
I had wrote enquiry to hdb. Thanks for the advise.,btohqsg
I didn't know that. Else I'd have asked for 99 years lease when I selected my unit few years ago.  The officer didn't give me the option  and I was under the impression that seniors can only opt for short lease.  Sheeze... üòí,btohqsg
Short lease is cheaper than 99 lease. But lower resale value,btohqsg
Your resale levy will be higher for 99y lease if applicable,btohqsg
What do u mean lower resale value? My understanding cant be sold in resale mkt.,btohqsg
I believe need more transparency from HDB. When my sis wanted to purchase a flat with a shorter lease  we were informed that the buyback price would be based on the purchase price  prorated for the unused lease period. However  we noticed whn the pty was made avail thru SBF  the purchase price for the next owner was based on the current mkt val.,btohqsg
Faraid is not a will. Muslim can only bequeath up to 1/3 (33.33%) of their total estate to non-heirs through their will (Wasiyat). Any attempt to bequeath > this limit is considered invalid. The remaining estate must be distributed to the heirs according to Faraid  ensuring immediate heirs receive their fixed shares (Share Certificate issued by Syariah Court).,btohqsg
Any idea how is the resale levy computed? Currently I have to pay $15k for a 30yr lease. Single occupancy.  Just curious as I don't think I can request for change after the agreement has been signed.,btohqsg
Hi. The age range to get a BTO for single is it 30 years old or 35 years old?,btohqsg
For 2 room is also age 35 too?,btohqsg
Okay. Thanks I have read the requirement.,btohqsg
Think there was a link on HDB website on resale levy but not sure if info is updatedThere was a senior folk who opted 99y lease for his 2R  resale levy was ~90kIf i don't remember wrongly,btohqsg
YeahPerson is in another group chatSaid 90k of resale levy according to his HLE for the 99y 2RI only know that he had the option of short lease but went for the 99yDon't know his exact age or moving from where to whereAnother person i know  over 55  40y lease  downgraded to 2R  levy ~18k,btohqsg
Maybe his previous flat is before 3 march 2006,btohqsg
90k resale levy for 2 room is just nonsense info. Not a fact.,btohqsg
Maybe the flat bought before 3 March 2006 is a 5 room.Now become millions  dollars resales,btohqsg
He was talking about 2room being 90k levy dude. Not 5room,btohqsg
Maybe he listen wrongly.Who knowsGive people some slack,btohqsg
Normal life already have alot of miscommunication  even online even more,btohqsg
Yes. Alot of fake news nowadays,btohqsg

Hello guys  I wanna ask if the hdb loan amount gotten through the HFE can be reassessed even after getting a number for BTO?,btohqsg
Hmm based on my understanding best not too,btohqsg
What your reason for reassessment ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if HFE needs to be reassessed if changed jobs? Either before the sales launch or before signing of agreement of lease,btohqsg
Nope. As long as no break in employment it‚Äôs okay,btohqsg
Any changes to HFE (high chance) could cause your Q number to be voidAs each Q number tie to HFEWas told by hdb personal when asked via phone (in the past)Get a new HFE don't mean will have more loanCould also cut down the load amountHFE loan amount are max you can getBut when everything settled you may not need that much of loan,btohqsg
But still i heard hdb going to do another check 3months before key collection? If not satisfied will they void our downpayment all together? Eg if our cpf not enough to pay the total cost and we change job to lower pay and unable to get high loan?,btohqsg
Won't be voided  but you need to pay the shortfall at key collection  or take loan from an FI,btohqsg
What happen if unable to get loan from fi and  pay the shortfall? Means void?,btohqsg
Payment is a condition to collecting the flat keys  so likely HDB will reclaim it,btohqsg
If you have an existing flat that you are trying to sell off at the same time  there are optionsOtherwise nohttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/key-collection,btohqsg
Or can opt for bridging loan for bank loan if not eligible for hdb loan.,btohqsg
Ok. Will our downpayment be return?,btohqsg
Doubt so‚Ä¶ but they do give extension to sell flat. Just need to justify to them that you‚Äôre unable to sell,btohqsg
How long the most extended period we ever heard?,btohqsg
Not everyone own a property to sell. I think most only looking to wait for the bto to complete. If they're not going to give our downpayment back then its only fair they dont reasses the hfe 2 month before key collection,btohqsg
Noted on your first point. The purpose of the re-assessment on HDB part is to ensure that you have the means to take up the loan and the financial ability to pay the mortgage.,btohqsg
Yes i understand ur point sir. What i mean is if they not satisfies with our ability to pay then they should fairly return our dp and all other associate cost,btohqsg
Because bto is a long wait. Dont know what unexpected event could happen while waiting üò¢,btohqsg
the reason is for example the bto i am looking at is about 500k. I have about <200k in my cpf OA and the hfe assessed to give me only 160k loan because my partner does not have a stable job i believe. The remaining is still a huge amount so if the loan doesnt increase  how would i pay off the hdb at the start because my cash wont be enough,btohqsg
If you fail to collect the flat or become ineligible after signing the lease  a forfeiture fee of 5% of the purchase price will be applied. Additionally  administrative and legal fees paid are non-refundable.,btohqsg
Ur partner cpf oa how much?,btohqsg
@160kloan i assume Nic househld income work out abt 2.7k for 25yrs @3.16%.  Tough to get higher bank loan due to stricter stress test criteria thus reducing loan quantum.,btohqsg
Hmmm maybe you can appeal and see how it goes‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes. Best is they give back our downpayment if not satisfy. Some project takes very long like the urbanville. Anything can happen. I think that one 6 years..launch in 2020,btohqsg
When signing a lease agreement  it's crucial to discuss the forfeiture clause with the Hdb officer in charge. Buyers have the choice to either proceed with the agreement or forfeit their booking fee; otherwise  they risk losing 5% of the transaction value.,btohqsg
Need to carefully read before signing anything,btohqsg
Its not Fake.  Possible as Im one of those affected.,btohqsg
very minimal as my partner barely worked and she is a freelance now,btohqsg
I am quite confused as alot of people say just get the number first and in the future when my partner salary increase or have stable income  just email in to appeal.,btohqsg
I mean.. an avg 500k hdb. shouldnt it be affordable?,btohqsg
For those on the Home Loan Eligibility (HLE) scheme  reassessment is available for either an increase or decrease in loan amount. However  for individuals on the Home Financing Eligibility (HFE) scheme  the option to apply for a higher loan fm Hdb is no longer available.,btohqsg
I think best is to buy one according to ur current budget. Not future budget. Buy the one u can afford. 500k is over budget in ur current situation..have u ballot for a flat?,btohqsg
People also ought to remember that applicants can appeal but appeal doesn't guarantee a successful outcomeCan try to appeal but should also have backup plansIf your BTO isn't ready until few years later  then do something these few yearsIncrease your income  increase your savings etc,btohqsg
Eh what happened in your case  if you don't mind sharing? Thanks,btohqsg
Are you downgrading or upgrading though?99y lease?,btohqsg
For 55 yo & above  maybe can try Silver Housing grant or bonus thing...,btohqsg
ill try to appeal then to see if it works to get a higher loan with a higher income in the near future before key collection,btohqsg
If the HFE scheme was implemented to close a loophole in the HLE scheme  be prepared for backup plan to address any potential challenges in the future.,btohqsg
High grant and high loan amount,btohqsg
How so though? Any source for this? ThanksSeems like whether for HLE or HFE  it would be -Income lower - higher grant  lower loanIncome higher - lower grant  higher loanBoth are tied to incomeHFE gives an overview of all the finances all at once whereas in HLE  components are broken upUnless the situation is  for the same assessed income  applicant is getting a lower loan amount under HFE  as compared to if they had applied through HLE,btohqsg
For HLE  if it was one working and one studying  they could get high grant when they applied.Subsequently nearer to key collection with both working and HDB reassessment of income  they could get high loan for their unit.,btohqsg
That was the loophole in the past which HFE is trying to correct.,btohqsg
Fiance / fiancee scheme or applies to all?When are grants disbursed under HFE under normal circumstances? Before lease signing?,btohqsg
How is that a loophole? If they have higher salary  than before when reasses why cant they get a higher loan?,btohqsg
For example when they first applied maybe they are just starting working. And maybe they waited for the bto to complete in 7 years  surely their income is higher when reasses,btohqsg
I think it was using the fiance fiancee scheme.This is for HLE time  not HFE,btohqsg
pre-covid and years before  build times were actually 3-4 years,btohqsg
Would like to check anyone know if bto completing end of this year  my kid can register his primary school this yr with the new address?,btohqsg
In any case  now they will just take the loan amount in your HFE. So better budget properly with the current eligible loan amount. Otherwise the shortfall have to pay with cash,btohqsg
yes though I agree with you on this  HDB doesn't see it that way currently.,btohqsg
i think there may be a way...best to call the school itself to check this...and also check MOE website....there r certain conditions..like proof of docs,btohqsg
Is it? I saw one at yishun aranda breeze. 7 years to complete by 2028. Launch in 2022.,btohqsg
2022 is still considered covid period,btohqsg
Even for HLE  doesn't sound like there is really reassessment unless applicant appeals for higher loan(again  appeal does not necessarily mean outcome must be successfulMore like renewal...If income is lower as compared to the past  loan amount eligible will be reviewed and probably be loweredIf income stays the same or is higher as compared to the past  no change to loan amount eligible,btohqsg
There is for HLE. They did not need to appeal back then.Currently what you're saying here is what HFE is doing: If income is lower as compared to the past  loan amount eligible will be reviewed and probably be loweredIf income stays the same or is higher as compared to the past  no change to loan amount eligible,btohqsg
U may read more here as i also have a child so i already study all this,btohqsg
Income stays the same or becomes higher and no change to loan amount eligible is also what i have been hearing about HLE though,btohqsg
Yes. This is the projects that take super duper long. Around 6-7years. Even the feb 2024 is faster. Woodgrove edge is projected to complete in 2027.,btohqsg
I see... But I have heard otherwise as well. Maybe in those cases I've heard  their original loan amount was unable to cover up previously  hence with the income reassessment  HDB increased it automatically.,btohqsg
Yes but that specific person also should understand the build time. It's not as if HDB hides it from them... The choice to bid for a certain project is up to the buyer and he/she should do their due diligence (make their bed and lay in it).,btohqsg
Yes. I understand ur point. My point is that while waiting for the bto surely their salary would increase,btohqsg
yes. But HDB does not seem to want to increase the loan quantum because they now show what you are eligible upfront BEFORE you select your flat. I think they assume that people will make decisions based on their current loan quantum  but it seems otherwise from the ground sentiment.,btohqsg
Hdb rules is quite confusing nowadays. üòÖ,btohqsg
And quite really  no review / reassessment / renewal for HFE when nearing key collection doesn't quite make sense tooSome things don't change whether it is HLE or HFE eraHFE is not some magic that guarantees an appliant's ability to repay loan stays the same throughoutThere will be some applicants whose income are somewhat adversely affected for various reasons  unexpectedly,btohqsg
Yeah. Anything can happen during the waiting period of waiting for the bto to complete,btohqsg
yes it is... and they don't put out official statements when they make subtle changes.,btohqsg
Yes it doesn't.. But there are alternatives like bank loan available  it's not a dead end I guess...,btohqsg
How is this different from HLE then?,btohqsg
Welcome. because of the 30months staying period is quite ridiculous la  no wonder no couples want to wait for BTO ready then have kids by the time age also catching up  no wonder fertility so lowMy child will be K1 almost K2 when my BTO is completed then waiting for Pri school is 12 months+ so the 30 Months not met also siao one,btohqsg
It's not supposed to be that much different. The difference should have only been for applicants to know how much loan and grant they are eligible for upfront instead of in stages like in HLE.,btohqsg
Worse... People would share on reddit or elsewhere that different HDB officers might give different answers for the same question because their understanding or interpretation of what HDB would do differs from person to person,btohqsg
btw  I don't work for HDB ah. Just thinking from their perspective based on their press releases.,btohqsg
Loan is the variable but under HLE  people are supposed to have a valid HLE at the point of application tooAs for grant  information is out in the publicApplicants can also estimate their grant amount beforehand,btohqsg
Estimate yes but it may differ. So now HDB frontload all the anxiety inducing details to you liao so that you can make a more informed financial decision on your purchase üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyways  there is nothing we can do individually to change their stance. You wanna send in petition?,btohqsg
To some extent  i feel like not that much difference between HLE and HFEAnd HFE might have came about due to internal changes within HDBInstead of 5 pax doing grant and 5 pax doing loan  now all 10 pax doing both tasksMAYBE,btohqsg
never try never know  maybe become like SimplyGo?üòè,btohqsg
idk... and I don't wanna presume how they work.,btohqsg
How they work is u just follow our rules. U like it or not just FOLLOW. lol,btohqsg
Eh  those note applicable for BTO project? How I gonna stay there for 30 mths if I am getting my key within 2 years? üòÇ,btohqsg
That is why MAYBEBecause can't see significant difference between how HLE and HFE really affects applicants so farOther than system crashing more badly than during HLE eraü´¢,btohqsg
It is lesser work for them overall  because they don't have to go through another round of reassessment unless the income of the buyers drop.E.g. Just before key collection they ask you to submit income docs:1) If current income docs > flat application income docs  do nothing.2) If current income docs < flat application income docs  reduce loan quantum.,btohqsg
I have no objection about anything much to wanna send petition  ha haWhat i find annoying is  the ambiguity from HDB,btohqsg
ya agreed... they should streamline their responses.,btohqsg
I think this change or no change in income part is or should be the same for both HLE and HFENeed BTO HFE people to confirm how it is like when nearing their key collectionAny idea when the first batch will be available? ü§≠Probably not much difference for the SBF HFE peeps,btohqsg
still long. HFE started in May 2023. But applicants needed valid HFE letters applied for a flat in the October 2023 BTO sales exercise. So it should be Oct 2023 BTO onwards.,btohqsg
Yes i think so just submit the docs that needed,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone have any speculation on when the Feb results will be out?,btohqsg
Anyone's profile picture missing already for feb 2024?,btohqsg
Iirc April but no specific date,btohqsg
Curious to know this as well,btohqsg
my grant is 25k and max loan is 250k. Is it normal?,btohqsg
Grant 25K  meaning household income is 6.5 - 7KNot sure about the loan part,btohqsg
ThanksAlthough i still think the change isn't that significant or drastic kind üòù,btohqsg
By the way  anyone knows if HFE preliminary is still a thing...?I mean  there were people who saw higher grant or loan amount during the prelim check until they received the final letter of sort,btohqsg
"Yes  just one applicationBut in terms of the grant  loan eligible etc  doesn't say will be more stringent or whatEsp for the loan part since grant still be more or less ""like that""",btohqsg
yea but the loan they offer me for maximum is only 250k,btohqsg
Usually when Feb bto results when out ?,btohqsg
Usually hdb say April u just take it as last day of the month.Just put your hopes as last day of the month,btohqsg
Only 250K...So  how much are you expecting??,btohqsg
Then what is this 160K loan here about?Is the 500K BTO something that you can afford comfortably or are you looking to finance the bulk of it through loan??,btohqsg
the 160/170k is the mid range loan from hdb and the 250k is the max loan from hdb,btohqsg
Have you selected your 500K BTO?,btohqsg
i am just asking if its normal for grant to be 25k and the loan amount to be 250k maximum / 170k mid as well,btohqsg
Calculate your MSR at 30%  with int rate 3.16%  chk the loan tenure against your approval. If the amt aligns with your max loan amt  it's considered normal. If there's a discrepancy  you may need to consult with HDB to understand how they derived the max loan amt.,btohqsg
Grant Is GrantLoan Is Loan2 different things ya,btohqsg
What do you mean whether it is normal for grant or loan amount to be those figures...These are based on assessment of your income + other applicant details and so onIf your salary is higher  chances are your loan amount eligible will also be higher but grant becomes lower,btohqsg
Grant amt usually incl Core Occupier income whereas loan base on Owner income,btohqsg
My Grant is 25K based on my applicationMy loan based on my application is $200KBut that time is my wife is not PR yet. (I apply with my wife and SC child)When my wife become PR and i included her in as co owner so hdb included her Salary contribution and loan amount increase to $400KSo this is it.Grant is Fixed when your application that time w your applicant's Salary contribution etc,btohqsg
But Grant is included all your Applicant's and yourself Salary to count the grant,btohqsg
Suggest you rethink your 500K BTO?Because it doesn't sound like something you are truly comfortable withAnd don't forget things like renovation and so onGetting your own place is supposed to be a happy thingThe last things you will want next time are to be burdened by the loan and to quarrel with your wife over money,btohqsg
For HFE  once you register and apply for BTO  cannot be reassessed for higher grant? example  loss of income,btohqsg
in short  if got pay increment over the years  better not tell the officers ?,btohqsg
You will still need to provide this before collection of keys.,btohqsg
Grant is less flexibleBased on 12 months income but like start from 14 months before the applicationLoan  i believe still can try to appeal when nearer key collection but (sigh  bluntly) don't pin hopes,btohqsg
Say  application is in February 2024Period of income to be assessed should be January - December 2023,btohqsg
And applicant should ensure continuous employment or income during those 12 monthsAt least during the HLE era  there were people who didn't work a few months and not eligible for EHG,btohqsg
Hi  where did you find this?,btohqsg
Thats why its best to secure bto/sbf asap. Before hdb change rule again. Bloody sian,btohqsg
Will it work for DIA? that if both applicants are students 12+2 months prior to HFE application  they can be eligible for Deferred Income Assessment?,btohqsg
High chance can go to SBF,btohqsg
What will be  will beMaybe rules change for the better next time leh,btohqsg
I doubt. Better for gov n hdb only,btohqsg
Imo global economy uncertainty could affect housing. Be cautious with spending. Pte homes often twice as costly as HDB for same size. Cycle: Sell HDB after MOP  upgrade to private. Risk: Housing bubble if income doesn't keep up. Financial trouble may force sales  not covering CPF refund.  Stay safe!,btohqsg
i enquired regarding my hle application and the reassessment nearing key collection / expressed concern abt current low loan quantum - and i was told that theyll reassess again and revise the loan if theres an improvement in income.hope this helps if anyone is concerned haha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the old one. HFE no reassess,btohqsg
For those signed lease before oct 2023 like me still will using the HLE during key collection  not HFE.,btohqsg
Around when will your reassessment be?,btohqsg
Will the improvement in income have to be substantial  not like increment of only few K over the years to make a difference?,btohqsg
personally  mine is still abt 3-4 years away.,btohqsg
yeah thats fine  they said they‚Äôll do a general reassessment again to help with loan quantum.,btohqsg
HDB said HLE reassessment will be around 3 months before key collection,btohqsg
I know it is few months before key collectionAnge understood my question  anyway,btohqsg

if your queue number exceed the no. of flats available  can you hold on to this queue number and apply for the next bto flats?,btohqsg

Normal Occupier no need to worry example u see :If i got my 2nd child while waiting for my BTO keys collection i also can add in the child name after getting the flat,btohqsg
Grant won't be eligible they are pretty straight forward abt this,btohqsg
Unless you qualify for deffered then diff story,btohqsg
Can try appealing  they review case by case,btohqsg
Grant only given after 12mon of payslip(-2 prior application) consideration they're pretty strict on this otherwise they ask you go for deffered assessment,btohqsg
I have a few residents who appealed as they didn‚Äôt have the full 12 months and they got the grant,btohqsg
Hmmmm guess I was the unlucky one,btohqsg
Yes. I heard its possible to get hfe with 6months payslip but no grant.,btohqsg
No more OBFOnly SBF (Feb only) and BTO (Feb June October),btohqsg
Is because now new rules kick in . Within Q never go select banned for a yrThis lead to BTO and SBF low dropped out rate also and no more flat to be Open Booking liao,btohqsg
Hi there. Anyone has link to Alkaff Breeze chatgrp please?,btohqsg
Hello does anyone knows October bto location or normally when is it announced?,btohqsg
hi adding on to this question for a friend! if q number is out of supply but with a high possibility that they may be called in to select a flat  if they reject it then - will they be considered as second-timers after that?,btohqsg
To my understanding if ur ballot number has 10 or fewer flat to choose from for BTO  non-selection count will be waived.,btohqsg
hi  when will hdb announce the dates of the june bto sales launch?,btohqsg
They won't announce the dates of launch before the launch; can just get HFE ready by before June  but expect the launch date to be end of June so you won't be disappointed if it's late Jun,btohqsg
Where can I check for all upcoming bto? Is the list for next year out already?,btohqsg
Unless you work for HDB nobody knows üåù only June‚Äôs locations are out.,btohqsg

Hello  can i check for those who has experience from booking a unit. How long does it take to reach yout turn if queue number is 20X?,btohqsg
The project i choose will start appt in may  so i am wondering how long will i need to wait before is my turn?,btohqsg
Also since my number is 203 and the supply of units is 229 for Chinese  do I stand a confirmed chance of getting a unit?,btohqsg
depends on hdb mood  usually will start slow around 2/3 per day for gro and mgps  then increase a bit to approx 8 for public queue,btohqsg
Wow so if they start in May  it may last till say June or July till my turn ah?,btohqsg
Thank u! Feel more at ease liao.,btohqsg
yeaa assuming start end may  shld be around end june/early july,btohqsg
End of may or start of June maybe2 weeks before your appointment will receive email sms on your package form and appointment scheduledCall call HDB at start of may to check on your appointment date,btohqsg
in theory  if 80% chinese quota means 183 chinese can book only. If everyone before you is a chinese and everyone books  means your queue at 203 cannot bookbut in real life  usually will have drop outs and also not everyone is a chinese  but i think u will need to monitor the ethnic quota closer to your date,btohqsg
Total unit is 229 for chinese,btohqsg
yea 0.8 x 229 = 183,btohqsg
u just need at least 20 non chinese then u can get to select hahaha,btohqsg
Will have drop out yours is within supplyJust the ethnic quota is an issue,btohqsg
Usually hdb will mix different ethic groups per appt?,btohqsg
U mean usually will have drop outd one ah?,btohqsg
yea  usually will have drop out,btohqsg
but with the new measures where if u drop out then u get second timer instantly  i think less ppl will drop out than usual,btohqsg
But usually if queue number is within supply  chances of getting a unit consider high?,btohqsg
You should have all the info total number of unitsNumber of ethnic for individual race,btohqsg
Total number of units allocated is 229,btohqsg
Total number of units for all race are > 229229 for ChineseCorrect?,btohqsg
100% confirmed have just which unit available and when it the appointment date,btohqsg
Did you waited long before your turn to select?,btohqsg
Hdb will have my appointment in systsm before they send me SMS?,btohqsg
Yes just depends on if they want to tell youIf they give you a date when you askMore or less confirm date just it's morning or afternoonCan plan base on the date,btohqsg
Thank you so much for helping!,btohqsg
I want earlyWaited around 30 mins maybe before my turn,btohqsg
I mean the waiting time before your queue number was allocated a appointment date to select a unit?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows when is the next sbf?,btohqsg
What was ur number back then?,btohqsg
My number was out of supply by a few numbers2xx,btohqsg
Your number was smaller than my,btohqsg
But u also got a unit?,btohqsg
Then i think mine maybe near to end June liao,btohqsg
Start to mid June more likely but not comfirm until you receive the package email,btohqsg
Sometimes hdb not consistent in allocating ah?,btohqsg
Usually what is included in the package email?,btohqsg
Need to bring a lot of documents on actual appointment day?,btohqsg
Just bring what is stated in the package letter you wouldn't go wrong,btohqsg
My package letter omitted some stuff they needed.But didn't need make another trip  just needed to upload softcopy after the appt,btohqsg

Anyone knows of any software to use with the floorplan to plan furniture placement all those? Like in The Sims...,btohqsg
will y'all consider doing this if there is an intention to engage an ID?,btohqsg
Still deciding if wanna hire ID or not. But wanna have some fun planning the layout with more accuracies.,btohqsg
Normally the ID is the PM right? Can hire just purely PM one?,btohqsg
"It depends on how detail and particular you are going into itFor example  the laying of tiles.You may want the odd size to ""hide"" in a corner where furniture partially blocks the view. Thus  the full size is laid from the door  and the odd size is left to the side.Some PMs may just want to get the job done without taking notes and start lying from the side. It ends up being an odd size on the side of the door. Thus  once you step in  you can see the odd size.",btohqsg
My friend house having multiple defects ask ID to settle but keep having issues and say those contactor used to be good don't have so much issues in the pastMaybe due to holiday season work very rush,btohqsg
Hire ID or not end of the day must be self inspection can't relie on others,btohqsg

Hi anyone have idea about OBF will be launch in this year ü•π,btohqsg
Unlikely in my opinion  considering the tighter rule of non selection. Most applicants now are more careful when applying for bto or sbf unlike b4 the rule implemented. Thus  lesser units non selected  which means unlikely theres OBF. Just my thought  i maybe wrong.,btohqsg
And SBF sales is once a yr now  the units sold like hotcake.,btohqsg
im looking for SBF too.. :(( but dont know which to believe when to hdb  they say have to wait for june and wasnt satisfied and so i sent e feedback and this is what they sent,btohqsg
If the upcoming BTO can complete likely 2 years time  how good  right?,btohqsg

Wonder ü§î if hfe letters expire on 23 June I wonder if I got time to apply for the June bto,btohqsg
Or need to redo the hfe again,btohqsg
If mine hfe letters not expire yet can I reapply?,btohqsg
HFE reapply one month before expiry,btohqsg
Your HFE only valid if the June BTO application start on or before 23 June,btohqsg
To be safe better to reapply and renew ur hfe,btohqsg
The launch might be 30th june. If before 23rd then ur safe,btohqsg

hi guys  just wanted to ask for Married Child Priority Scheme(MCPS) does anyone know if my parents have to sign anything before i head down go select unit? and now they say video call only right they dont need to be there physically? anyone can advise on this pls  thanks in advance üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº,btohqsg
They have to sign the undertaking of MCPS which is in your application form.They don‚Äôt need to be there physically as the HDB officer will video call them using your phone. Please ask them to standby with their NRIC during your selection period.,btohqsg
okay noted on that i think i found where they need to sign  also the document mentioned we need to bring birth cert and marriage cert did u experience this also?,btohqsg
Ya just bring. They need proof of child parent relationship as well as marriage of parents. If got any divorce judgement also bring that,btohqsg
okay thanks  so all in all they need to sign the application form  i need to prepare ic  birth cert and my parents marriage cert and ask them to standby with their ic‚Äôs for a video call during the time of my flat selection correct?,btohqsg
alright thank u so so much üôèüèºüôèüèº,btohqsg
They will video call both parents? Or just one?,btohqsg
i think should be just one cos like my mum doesnt have a phone hahahahha but both must be present to show their ic,btohqsg
hi! Just wanted to ask if I update my current hfe  will my loan and grant amount change as well? or do i need to cancel and reapply? thanks!,btohqsg

hey guys  my hfe expires in july  can i not resubmit a hfe application if i want to participate in the june bto?,btohqsg
When did you apply for your hfe?,btohqsg
HDB willextend the validity of all existing and new HFE letters to 9 months  from the current 6 monthsThis extension of the validity period of HFE letters will take effect from 7 November 2023.,btohqsg
hmm  not exactly sure when  but on hdb website  it says my hfe is ‚ÄúValid until 03 Jul 2024‚Äù. so was wondering whether i can skip the re-application if i wanna participate in june‚Äôs bto,btohqsg
As long as you apply before the expiry should be fine,btohqsg
Hi hi  anyone know for BTOs the standard main door and bedroom door measurements for both door and door frame?,btohqsg
Reapply if you want to get the grant depends on your combined income but if second applicant doesn‚Äôt have income I believe your loan will be different also,btohqsg
Anyone know how to check which priority scheme you are under? I am eligible for both mcps and parenthood one. Will it be stated in HFE letter or ballot results?,btohqsg
If your ballot is from MCPS your application form will have a form called Undertaking of MCPS.,btohqsg

No it was may 2022 bto,btohqsg
So sorry for your loss‚Ä¶ Is there anyone you can replace with to form the family nucleus?,btohqsg
Sorry for your lost . I had checked this beforeconsider as a cancellation of the flat. But because its due to a deceased case  the 5% or 10% cpf will be returned but stamp fees will still be confiscated. HPS will not kick in coz the loan have not started yet.So your only solution is either u form with another Singaporen family members ORGet Married amd ROM,btohqsg
Ok but things shld be fine if I get married before I collect the key?,btohqsg
I doubt so ‚Ä¶ they all move out,btohqsg
Must write into them to change the ownership,btohqsg
Ok so once married we will inform hdb   or I shld inform first ? Buy haven married le,btohqsg
I did not ask this. Maybe u call hdb check is better,btohqsg
I think best to consult your partner and also write into HDB first to appeal to see if you can change ownership. They are likely to accede as it is due to unfortunate circumstances.,btohqsg
I believe if u can produce the ROM certificate then no issue,btohqsg
Yes don't rush into married just to get the BTO hdb flat .If can't get now then give up the flat and wait till u 35 then ballot for 2rm flexi or u have another relatives sg can apply w u now to Change the name,btohqsg
Your situation is special. Since you were eligible to purchase and met the criteria when signing the lease agreement  you can keep the house even if you are under 35 years old. However you need to consider these1. Was the purchase made in Joint Tenancy or Tenancy in Common?2. Has the down payment been paid with the grant?3. Hdb will reassess your loan eligibility.  Can you afford to pay in cash for any shortfall and manage the monthly payments as a sole applicant?,btohqsg
Joint tenancy no down payment require as we‚Äôre still holding one house,btohqsg
Who owns the existing flat and the manner in which it is held (Jt Tenancy or Tenancy in Common). Was it acquired through a BTO or resale (with or without grant)?,btohqsg
Is this a dngrade? My understdg purchasers are required to pay 10% for HDB loan or 20% for a Bank loan upon signing the lease agreement.,btohqsg
I was told that my case is exceptional case  which only require to pay the down payment or remaining in cash when we collect the key,btohqsg
I think in your case  because u currently have a house  hdb understand that the value of ur current house is enough to support ur bto purchase,btohqsg
I see. So ur eligible. U can also create a family nucleus with one of ur sibling under orphan scheme,btohqsg
How many room is ur bto?,btohqsg
"Confirm if there is a down payment required as you previously mentioned ""no down payment required.""",btohqsg
Yes I didn‚Äôt make any payment except for the option fee,btohqsg
The officer says I just make the payment during key collection,btohqsg
The way you hold existing (manner of holding?) and new BTO flats (Jt tenancy) impacts your purchase affordability. With Tenancy in Common  you must distribute late dad's share to other beneficiaries  which could limit funds for the next purchase if you rely on dad's share. Bear in mind of potential levy.,btohqsg
Usually  rightsizing to 3rm and below does not require any down payment except for the option fee. However  if upgrading from 3rm to a larger size  a down payment is necessary.,btohqsg
Ya current is 3 room   bto also 3 room,btohqsg

when you go for key collection..? You can opt for a bank loan,btohqsg
I understand that if hdb loan not enough to cover  need to do cash top up but what if i dont have even cash on hand  what are the next course of steps i can take?,btohqsg
Will bank loan be lower then hdb‚Äôs?,btohqsg
they might extend you a larger loan quantum but of course the interest rate might be higher than HDB Loan,btohqsg
your reply is to my reply ah?,btohqsg
Best is hdb loan or fama loan,btohqsg
Not everyone has a mountain backing them. Anways case in point  my bank loan quantum higher than my HDB loan so I took bank loan.,btohqsg
theoretically HDB loans you 80%  but in reality  seems like HFE now gives lower,btohqsg
But none of the HFE loans have been disbursed yet. So hard to say...,btohqsg
Yeah. Good u can get bank loan. Not everyone eligible to apply for bank loan,btohqsg
ya and hence they have HDB loan. Maybe OP can appeal to HDB for higher loan quantum in the future. It should be possible...,btohqsg

Since you're under the HLE scheme  yes  your loan will be reassessed  closer to key collection,btohqsg
Meaning HDB will call us again to head down? So i dont have to call them?,btohqsg
Not head down  they should inform you via email / HDB portal to submit income documents,btohqsg
You can write in / call HDB if you wish to clarify specifics about this,btohqsg

I‚Äôve heard a few couples who need to forfeit their application due to not enough loan and there would not be any reassessment during key collection. This is based on HFE not HLE. Is it true?,btohqsg
I mean like from what I know last time is we can reassess the loan again upon the key collection,btohqsg
Some say can appeal but some say cannot,btohqsg
Hmm I see.. I just feel it‚Äôs unfair when couples are trying to plan to have a house on their own in the future but ended up being forfeited cause not enough loan now but having enough in the future,btohqsg
As i remember  u can always appeal to reassess.. the loan amount maybe reduced  but will not increase..,btohqsg
Hi future neighbors  putting here to share about HFE loan reassessment. HDB came to my school for a talk last week. Along with a staff  the CEO held a q&a.The staff clarified during the q&a that yes  there will be a review for loan assessment but it isnotfor higher loan amount. Is is only for lower amount  do not expect loan revision to be higher if it is reassessed. Their official stance is to make up the shortfall (if any) with cash or change to bank loan. The CEO then said that this is partly to close the loophole of high grant + high loan.(Edit: there also will not be an option to forgo the grant to get higher loan )I don‚Äôt have black and white  but that‚Äôs what was being said during the talk. I guess since he‚Äôs the highest ranking exec  this should be firm until further notice üòÖ,btohqsg
Its not easy for hdb to forfeited your bto. They will surely do what ever neccesary to secure u the bto. And give u the necessary alternative finance option like bank loan. For a higher hdb loan probably one need to go through an appeal process. Or else it will end up as balance flat which cause more work for them.,btohqsg
Sales of balance telegram group chat just disappear?,btohqsg
They can switch to bank loan or appeal to reassess or cough up the shortfall or cover it with their CPFOA or just not take such an expensive flat (certain ppl whack high floor thinking that they can afford when key collection comes)  but now HFE tells you upfront your loan amount by HDB so should plan with that in mind‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes. I agree. Always act based on current budget. Not future budget. Some people i know they whack on 5room. When they can only afford 3 room. Thinking in future they can get better salary or more cash in oa cpf,btohqsg
It changed to private group I can't access,btohqsg

Hi guys abit off topic anyone have any idea about the HDB Hfe loan as I'm self-employed for three years but haven't contributed to CPF. I'm planning to get my house this year.Will this lack of CPF contributions affect my loan eligibility? I file income tax and contribute to Medisave regularly. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!EDIT: My bto will likely TOP this coming q4,btohqsg
From my experience it should not affect. You just need to take a lot of care in prepping bank statements / rental statements / income statements of all sorts  to show continuity  most importantly it is to show that you‚Äôre working constantly without gaps and generating income monthly.Rental or housing statements help too to show that you‚Äôre paying things regularly,btohqsg
Hi  during key collection the loan amount eill be revised and be told on the spot is it,btohqsg
Depends if you are on HLE or HFE.,btohqsg
I am on HLE for the greencrest project at tampines,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ then yes 1-2 months before key collection HDB will contact you. Though I have friends who did not get any loan reassessment for their HLE. So just note that in mind‚Ä¶,btohqsg
