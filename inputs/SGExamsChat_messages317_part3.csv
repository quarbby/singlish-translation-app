any thoughts on school counsellors? I am thinking of seeing one in uni as Im feeling quite stressed with sch though i had a bad experience with a school counsellor back in sec sch,btohqsg
My current school counsellor is lit!,btohqsg
i do want to seek help as my uni journey has been quite tough  feeling quite stressed and down lately,btohqsg
i am pretty much an introvert so i dont have a lot of friends to talk to and i kinda like being by myself but that backfires when there are grp assignments and i have to be grped with not so good people,btohqsg
for one of the mods im taking  i joined a grp with 2 girls who are pretty close to each other and they dont really make the effort to talk to me or get to know me,btohqsg
i feel kinda invisible tbh and im kinda dreading going to sch,btohqsg
any advice on what shld i do?,btohqsg
"im not sure how much this will help out but i think this is something u need to speak up to get to know them because nothing can really come to you on a silver platter in every grp projthough  if they're shitty people then i think u j gotta bite through for the sem :"")",btohqsg
if it helps  i think there are tele channels that cater to people finding study buddies in their unis,btohqsg
thats true i did make the effort to speak to them but they just dont really care tbh,btohqsg
"hang in there yeah! im currently in uni dying too HAHAHAHA :"""")",btohqsg
AHAHAH my plan is to just contribute to the grp assignment and after that i'll just pretend i don't know them,btohqsg

Anyone knows if poly or jc is suitable for intp/infp,btohqsg
I don't think it really matters.,btohqsg
Mbti can know if you‚Äôre more hands on or theory,btohqsg
i dun judge by mbti. tell me ur good/evil alignment and i can tell u poly or jc more suitable,btohqsg
eg chaotic evil  chaotic good etc,btohqsg
MBTI means nothing. Don't get defined by a series of questions.,btohqsg
You can roughly know how you learn best,btohqsg
I'm a stereotype of my MBTI but it really is a pseudoscience  it doesn't really mean shit.,btohqsg
MBTI depends on how you answer the questions. If you take it twice  you may even get a different result.,btohqsg
"But anyway yeah  y'all are right  it's kind of astrology for people who are ""too good"" for astrology.",btohqsg
Last time I took MBTI  my result was ESTJ.But the I and E  the scores differed by 1 or 2 points I think. It's like somewhere in between.,btohqsg
direct translate not accurate. ask her to do the alignment test.,btohqsg
It was a joke  that's what I meant to say.,btohqsg
"I went to google ESTJ learning style:""ESTJs tend to do well in group discussion and learning situations. They like to think out loud with their peers and discuss facts and ideas in order to understand the concepts better.""I think I generally fare the worst in group discussions.",btohqsg
u claim to be a lawful evil. most lawful evils are just cowards who dont dare to be truly evil. üòÇ,btohqsg
I use the commonly-used interpretation of theDNDalignment chart,btohqsg
Evil just means I rather do things for myself,btohqsg
yes  but u dun dare to break the rules  hence u are a coward,btohqsg
Lawful means I have my own set of morals I follow.,btohqsg
The alignment chart is for a game anyway,btohqsg
Was a prank bro ü•∫ believe me bro was a prank,btohqsg
My irl alignment is non-existant btw  TLE is what I like to use because TheNecessaryEvil was taken,btohqsg
