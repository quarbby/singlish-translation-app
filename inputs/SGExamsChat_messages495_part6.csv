Yo that was uncalled for but i'll scan through that later,btohqsg
There will be ppl takung down bus arrivals,btohqsg
we were going from Salzburg Austria to Stuttgart  then had to stop in Munich to change. Train to Munich got delayed so much that we missed our next train so we waited for the next one. Then while waiting for the next one we ate lunch then happened to talk to some of the train station officers that told us casually that the train was leaving 30 mins earlier so if we didn't happen to talk to them we'd have missed that too,btohqsg
and frankly lots of people missed that train because many reserved seats were empty,btohqsg
1. I think the problem lies upon her environment. If she wasnt encouraged to do such things then like its nt rlly her fault but its concerning as she does not know current affairs... She doesnt take interest in it so it cant be forced but definitely it is general knowledge so either ways she must make herself interested.,btohqsg
