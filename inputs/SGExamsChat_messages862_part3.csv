But the issue with standardised test lies in,btohqsg
Your other relevant points are neglected   for example to enter med school,btohqsg
It will be preferable for schools to select a person who is experienced in medical activities before and that can count too,btohqsg
Get what I trying to say ?,btohqsg
I saw a video regarding China University admission vs US University admission....,btohqsg
😅 most importantly is we can convince the admission officer to let us in..the rest not important,btohqsg
Ppl will complain if usa University Standard of admission is used in China,btohqsg
And vice versa 😂😂 In China   the admission requirements is grades only you see.,btohqsg
In USA is cca + grades + standardised test + letter of recommendation,btohqsg
Letter of recommendation from teachers method of admissions won't work in China as they will think it is unfair for a student to get admissions into university just because a teacher wrote a better letter.,btohqsg

buy during uni promo usually june-sept will be cheaper,btohqsg
Poly promo not cheaper than uni promo?,btohqsg
That's why ppl should look out for unattended articles in public transport. 👍👍,btohqsg
If found notifying the staff would be the best option,btohqsg
It's harder(1) The average qualifying score for each subject has decreased from 3.33 (20÷6) to 3.2 (16÷5)(2) If any student has a particularly bad single subject within the L1R4  it's a larger percentage than before.Someone who consistently scores C6 for humanities for example  but A1 for science  will be more adversely affected than before.This system prioritises all rounders,btohqsg
Why can't we have both ? Standardise test which does not requires as many subjects and ECs as well. So technically its like what we are doing right now with AbA and 70RP,btohqsg
Poly promo for mac books are not as good as from the Apple store,btohqsg
if someone is bad at humanities but good at Art,btohqsg
Hmm.. I agree with your first point. Quantitatively speaking  its harder . However   on your 2nd point and example  if someone is already weak in Humanities then the L1R4 and R5 system does not matter as its a compulsory subject . In addition  students usually take more than 5 subjects in schools. Thus  let's say they are strong in sciences then they can take triple science and one combined Humanities.,btohqsg
Then  if they are weaker in Humanities  they can put more focus on thay combined subject.,btohqsg
So technically it's better in the sense that students can ditch some  subjects and focus on key subjects to score.,btohqsg
The quintessential portion of this new system is freeing up more time to focus on weaker areas and allowing students to ditch subjects that they can ignore. Personally I took double science and double math. So   I personally dislike sciences which allows me to ditch one of my sciences and instead ensure that my math and humanities can score.,btohqsg
i use myself as an example.I scored B3 for Eng and C6 for sole humans. The rest A1.this is 13 out of 20 for JC.New system makes it 12 out of 16. 😭,btohqsg
True but it means you can concentrate on your humans .,btohqsg
They still take humanities because jc requires at least 1 humanities subject,btohqsg
I mean GP is also humanities,btohqsg
Also side note Econs is not humanities,btohqsg
Econs is better than ss and Geo/lit/his,btohqsg
Is the most yee yee ass loophole ever,btohqsg
H2 econs > H1 econsH1 other humans > h1 econs,btohqsg
Yea so even if one hates humanities  they have no choice anyways,btohqsg
Because jc still requires a humans subject even for jc subject combi,btohqsg
Ye but JC humans is a different thing . Not everyone likes His/lit/geo,btohqsg
Also  despite econs being offered at the OLevels  many schools do not offernit,btohqsg
True yeah but it's more logical,btohqsg
No its not even logical is just structure,btohqsg
The theory behind it is logical,btohqsg
It is a generalisation of the current system which is far from logical,btohqsg
Its a bastardization of social sciences in the structure of pseudoscientific articles,btohqsg
much easier than lit. I got A. Lit was C6,btohqsg
I mean when you write it was legit you have to write in a structure rite?,btohqsg
me bruh i just did like half an hour of math the realise i don't have math tmr,btohqsg
Everything except PW > H2 Math,btohqsg
Well as Poly graduate found h1/2 Math particularly interesting since Poly Math is basically h1 Math with added stuff in,btohqsg
Especially on the engineering side of things but then we use normal calculator hence I need to train on gc use to ensure I can write good stuff for h1/2 Math,btohqsg
Actually tbh i think for engineering/science side  wld say poly math is arnd h2 math kind,btohqsg
Business/social sciences one maybe arnd h1 math,btohqsg
For tech   its not even h1 lmao,btohqsg
It's o level pure math and h2 stats,btohqsg
