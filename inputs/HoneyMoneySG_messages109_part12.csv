So youtrip to tng will be better to top up tng wallet?.1st june will incur the charges or all the long have the fees of 1%?,btohqsg
I read somewhere all foreign currency will be converted into USD before converting into sgd. But I'm not 100% sure about that.,btohqsg
I'm not sure... I guess using youtrip is the best according to@MelvynEzi. The amaze top up fee from mastercard credit cards are free  until they start charging 1% wef 1 June.,btohqsg
Able to use other credit cards to top up into tng wallet ?,btohqsg
Sg cc shld be have 1% incurring fees as Well?,btohqsg
TnG charges fee for top ups using credit card. That's why debit cards like YT or Amaze is preferred. Not forgetting the lousy FX rate by credit cards.,btohqsg
HSBC new nerf won't affect restaurant and bread shop right like four leave only ntuc affects and those kpitam,btohqsg

I see! That's probably where I read the fine prints many years ago! Tks for the clarifications. ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Actually best way to compare is to do a real time conversion comparison by toping up to tng,btohqsg
From now till 1 Jun  can always check the conversion rates on Amaze app and MasterCard's website then decide to use either Amaze Wallet or YouTrip. Afterwards no point because every top-up to Amaze Wallet has a fee.All SG CC will incur 1% fee for TnG reload  bad exchange rates by bank and 3.25% FX fee by bank.,btohqsg
Oh 5814 kana black liated then HSBC Revo kinda only can use on retail shopping,btohqsg
yes  to be safe just move dining expenses to other cards.,btohqsg
