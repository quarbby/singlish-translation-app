Those PE few K one I really don‚Äôt know how those company going to earn back,btohqsg
I think u got a lot of self reflection to do.I see u asking advice on a chain of stuckist counters. When happen too many times I think you are the issue not the counters,btohqsg
Yes broSorry about this but me no sure what to doLost really feel no goodMaybe you did not lost so you won't understand,btohqsg
Â§±Ë¥•ÊòØÊàêÂäü‰πãÊØçÔºålose is the mother of success.,btohqsg
Pls la I have lost multifold of what u have. Don‚Äôt come complain sob stories u hear mine u will be very glad u are in current position,btohqsg
younger support older  the later comer support the earlier comer in market   that''s healthy.,btohqsg
The point is money is lostHow to lose itLearn from it or repeat itIs own choice,btohqsg
I noticed the same too...U probably have to think why u bought these shares in the first place.... did u do the research before buying or just follow forum chat groups to buy thinking to make quick buck.... if so then it's just gambling... should stop this first,btohqsg
Those who came into market instantly made a lot and think is easyIs just waiting to be slaughtered for the ignorance and complacency,btohqsg
Most fall out. Some survive some licking wound some lurk around some learn and come back from it,btohqsg
No right or wrong. Some just aren‚Äôt suited to play the mental game in market.,btohqsg
Must learn to cut lost. I have lost $10k this month . If I never cut lost on MT and riverstone . I would have lose about 40k in total . Even sta I also cut loss at $1.50 series and lost about $4k.,btohqsg
But if u find yourself blaming whole world but ownselfU prob should just leave,btohqsg
if one lose from young to old in market  that can tell not suited. maybe one time gain back all lose.,btohqsg
Then do your own research about the stocks first to determine your own target price.. see if u wana hold or cut loss...What's important is u don't simply go around asking what's others target price... everyone has different positions that they buy into n different holding power,btohqsg
Nothing to sorry to me. U never lose my money. Is your own or maybe family or even kids education funds or what.Be sorry to themAfter the sorry  decide what‚Äôs next? Cut and get out of marketOr stay and become a better man in market?Own choice have to live with it,btohqsg
Only MT can ... the best performing stock I have seen... buy at lowest and sell at highest . $3000 investment return $198000,btohqsg
Not me. I wish is me . Haha,btohqsg
I think he meant option 3 is good too.,btohqsg
i small buy at 8C  unload all the way and only 3.5K to get the peak.,btohqsg
Ok your freedom of speech. Won‚Äôt reply u further.,btohqsg
Ok thanks for your advise.Will take note,btohqsg
Hi BroI did not do any research when buy them  I just follow forum chat to buyThis is my mistake now I realiseThank for your advise,btohqsg
Then just hold on...Last week mkt sentiment is so bad - not worth to cut now. CB price dropped slightly in tandem with overall medical counter.Sell when the sentiment is better and you can get a better price.Dont think it will get lower than what it is right now.,btohqsg
Me same same. I also learn from mistake .,btohqsg
I haven't learn to cut loss very strictly so far. also failed to get the profit quite well.,btohqsg
Groups have plenty of info going around. Some are facts some are views.Views will easily be biased. Someone vested will surely cheer for own stock regardless of movement. Nobody will curse own stock unless stop loss already.So a painful lesson but gonna learn from it. Price tag is slapped by market,btohqsg
"can you understand""Êó†ÊãõËÉúÊúâÊãõ‚ÄúÔºü maybe oneday you will have own stratigies for earn money.",btohqsg
Hi sisWow big profitCongratulationsYou really smartHappy for you.But MT now drop so much,btohqsg
Everyone here risking hard earned money. Nobody had it easy just got say or not.U aren‚Äôt the first nor the last and probably first time getting such shock so asking for help is natural. However no matter what help  no matter how bullish people are on your holdingsWhen they drop u are the one facing the losses not them,btohqsg
Humans are driven by greed...yours truly here included. Made a few rounds from CB...then decided to trade in one more time....of course  now stuck....,btohqsg
Every one here know lose is more people  earn is less people. has the preparations.,btohqsg
The prob is all think they are the minority,btohqsg
Of couse la  i also want to be the minortiy. otherwise  no play here le,btohqsg
Many peoples were laughing to the bank when a 20 cents share got fried to almost $2.00 by operators....,btohqsg
Thanks bro for your adviseWhat you say is correct,btohqsg
Ya surely. But easier get humbled by market then realise not so special afterall,btohqsg
I quote example ... not me la. Lol.,btohqsg
dn't play too big  play in the lose range can afford.,btohqsg
No worries . I also wish I have this foresight and luck. Lol.,btohqsg
Now the situation is  MT  VP  gloves  all want speculate once more to have a big bite. everybody know finally the price will go north.,btohqsg
Ok  sis you willYour time will come,btohqsg
Bro have you cut your aspen? Or you still holding?,btohqsg
Thanks for taking time to pen this well-thought and analytical post.üëç,btohqsg
I still holding my aspen as I hope it can go up abit before cut,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.üëçGood food for thought,btohqsg
A friend of my who is old time trader  he went in MT at 10 cents. He went out at 30 cents. He did not expect this counter to goreng so high. He said this counter start out as goreng only. Just that the earning really shoot off the roof  this goreng lasted so long. Still it went from few cents to current price is super impressive. But he never touch this counter Liow as he also don‚Äôt know when the goreng will end. His view is this still a few cents counter before Covid. I went in play at $1.60  he tell me to FIFO. Once the BB decide to draw out  the price may free fall. He told to remember to put stop lost if I play any penny. No one knows when BB draw out.,btohqsg
I play a bit only at 1.6,btohqsg
After hearing his warning I dare no play.,btohqsg
what are you thinking when you buy at 1.6?,btohqsg
