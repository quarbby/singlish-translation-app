Does anybody know if I can take h2 math without A math?,btohqsg
Most likely you have to be:â€¢ in science course;â€¢ Distinction in EMath;â€¢ Attend bridging,btohqsg
Yes I can study a math at home,btohqsg
But h1 donâ€™t need right ?,btohqsg
The differences between H1 math and H2 math isPure mathematics for H1 is easier than A math. I.e.   there is no quoient rule and product rule. Basically 20 to 30% of the A math syllabusButpure math for h2  is the extended verison of A math.,btohqsg
As for statiatics  they are more or less the same. Just there h1 math do not have cirucular permuation and drv,btohqsg
Although  if you have A Math knowledge (that is concrete) and better at pure Math  it's better for you to take H2 Math.,btohqsg
There are some struggling to ace H1 Math as they are horrible with statistics.,btohqsg
H1 Math is more statistics oriented  ace the stats portion and a pass is already guaranteed.,btohqsg
Yeah. Only 1- 3hours paperSection A is 40 marks which is pure math sectionSection B is 60 marks which is stat section.,btohqsg
