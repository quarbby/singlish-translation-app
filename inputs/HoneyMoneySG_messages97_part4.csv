Dbs woman card per month max spending cap at 1.5k?,btohqsg
dbs woman world mastercard 4mpd capped for $1.5k online spend monthly,btohqsg
Hi all   anyone has the UOB ladies solitare card?  the requirements is 120k annual salary.But my friend that got it did not even come close to that salary he said  roughly 60k. I am also around there but I failed to apply for it. Anyone successfully got it with pay < 60k?I think the difference is that I did not credit salary directly to uob one  but use bank transfer for the interests.,btohqsg
think ur friend applied last year when they are not strict on the requirement  nowadays even with $120k income may not get the card also,btohqsg
Ok thanks for info  you are right on the timings... my friend with over 100k applied last month and failed to get it too.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i purchase add-on baggage in JPY from scoot separately after buying the flight tickets  does this qualify for UOB lady's card (travel category) 6mpd (4 mpd after 31 march)?thinking of whether to using the UOB KF card or amaze + lady's card. I have already met the $800 SIA spending for UOB KF card. Thank you!!!,btohqsg
Hello guys  new to lady’s solitare. From your experience what is the 2 best categories to choose from? I chose dining and travel  but at the same time i dont travel all the time so i was thinking of changing travel to another cat.,btohqsg
It’s down to your own spending pattern and what other cards you have  there is no “best” that will apply to everyone. For each quarter  assess what you will need and what your other cards may not cover  and apply accordingly.,btohqsg
Your initial choice Travel/Dining is the best combi in my opinioneven after nerf to 4mpd in april  there remains no other card that can cater for Travel Bookings for 4mpd up to $2k per month (UOB VS maybe but needs to be contactless spending if in SGD).,btohqsg
Gotcha! Thanks for the input 😊,btohqsg
anyone can share which app or website can check and optimise credit card?,btohqsg
anyone received their $880 eCapitaVoucher from SNACK already?,btohqsg
SNACK eCapitaVouchers for recent promos:- $240 by 30th Apr 2024- $880 by 31st Mar 2024- $400 by 15th Feb 2024that being said.. Citi Prestige Limo due 31st March also not in yet,btohqsg
Yes.. 31st Mar is in 5 days only and 29 Mar is a public hol haha,btohqsg
Ya i kena this.. Two months 10k on the third month $486 because i was in hospital for three weeks and wasnt out spending,btohqsg
OMG u charged $10k each for 2 months to UOB One card? Why???,btohqsg
Didnt really keep track as my habit is all food on ocbc 365 all hospital bills and insurances on the amex trucashback 1.7% then all other entertainment expenses on uob one,btohqsg
Something like that.. I know dumb lol,btohqsg
Anyway this card is good for hospital bills too,btohqsg
yes it is good for those hospital payments which they don't allow you to push to Health Hub,btohqsg
This is 1.5% once that 1.7% card hit limit and dont allow u to do anymore temp increase,btohqsg
Only heartpain when they announce dont allow anymore grab top up,btohqsg
wah lau your hospital bill size... i hope everything is ok.. and more importantly can claim insurance!!,btohqsg
I am sort of forced to retire due to my medical condition.. So now almost everything rely on my passive income,btohqsg
eh... you got read the updates hor.. i cannot remember which Amex cards exclude insurance and hospitalisation from a certain date liaoi know UOB Amex Absolute still OK.. Amex Truecashback i am not 100% sure,btohqsg
Hence very into all these card rebates and high interest acct etc,btohqsg
So far i still got the rebates up to March for both cards. Will look out for any changes thanks bro,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea if they ask for income documents updates and i dont submit anything what will happen?,btohqsg
Will they stop the card or lower the limits? Frankly my income from 5digits drop to 4 digits alr because of my health but i dare not ask the banks dont want to alert them 打草惊蛇,btohqsg
depends on the wordingis it a friendly optional letter.. update your income with us and get $10 cash rebate..ORWE REQUIRE YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR LATEST INCOME DOCUMENTS,btohqsg
But on the whole  if your hosp bills are covered by insurance  and you still collect your salary  and you drop your spending significantly  it should cover for the $200 loss 😅🤪,btohqsg
Hello all   I would like to check whether using Suica Mobile on my iPhone and topping up with Amaze would classify as a local or overseas transaction?If not  do you have any suggestions on which card I should use to top up my Suica card?,btohqsg
A loss is still a loss haha,btohqsg
if you don't provide  they might suspend/terminate your account,btohqsg
suica is in JPY right? if so it will be topping up using JPY,btohqsg
how are you going to use Amaze to topup Suica?,btohqsg
Oh I thought I could link Amaze to Apple Pay and make payments from there.,btohqsg
applepay doesn't support Amaze for now,btohqsg
Thanks for the info MT! Do you happen to know if I can use YouTrip to top up my Mobile Suica card?,btohqsg
Hello guys  can anyone recommend a very gd stock screener/analyser or useful accurate app? Tku vm 🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg

Wonder if any experienced this before. I paid a restaurant in Taiwan shopping mall w UOB Lady + Amaze. MCC showed up as 5311 instead of dining. 🥲,btohqsg
Uob lady is a good start. Have Uob kf as a backup.,btohqsg
is 5311 under shopping? i just paid in korea lotte departmental store  dinner classified as shopping,btohqsg
For Japan. Korea. Taiwan.It is very common for all shops inside major malls to be coded as mcc 5311 (department store). Yes even their in house supermarket.If u want to be safe before making big purchase. Use amaze + empty wallet to check the mcc.,btohqsg
