no leh  Sargeant gonna win SG Gp ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö,btohqsg
Unless u able to identify any unique decal or something,btohqsg
probably some chao yp or fucktard uncle tbh,btohqsg
his car has no decals on it   all i know it was a middle aged man driving it,btohqsg
Not to me   but to my mum and sister . they aren‚Äôt used to fast pace driving   they had panic and anxiety attacks while i was being poked from woodlands sle to punggol,btohqsg
We will encounter such driver quite often  sometimes just have to suck it up and let it slide,btohqsg
i couldnt   he was pushing me to run 130/140 on busy traffic there‚Äôs cars everywhere . Occasionally i did changed from lane 1 and 2 he just continued to follow me,btohqsg
Some drivers think they big fuxk  always bully others otr,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think we can find the driver here  but do install a rear view cam if you think it‚Äôs needed,btohqsg
Try to note down plate number next time when u encounter similar incident,btohqsg
Tats the best way to locate Liao,btohqsg
i agree   i just don‚Äôt understand why poke ppl with family members inside üòÇ i mean if i were to be alone i would‚Äôve closed an eye . I dont think anyone understands what it feels like to drive with passengers having panic and anxiety attacks . quite stressful i must admit,btohqsg
I did   i woke up and i totally forgot it,btohqsg
Agree  but the driver might not be aware there were passengers inside,btohqsg
nope   i tried asking my sister and mum they didn‚Äôt really seem to remember . 4 digit number is what they recalled,btohqsg
But if he is a regular there  might bump into him again,btohqsg
We shall wait and see ba,btohqsg
Tf he bontot u all the way?? That‚Äôs just rude man,btohqsg
Feel sorry for ur fam bruh,btohqsg
Nvm you were with you family,btohqsg
I thought of it actually even did i once but all that did was cause more anxiety and panic attack to my  family hah so i just dealt with it . i let off throttle to alow him to pass didn‚Äôt work i accelerated it didn‚Äôt work i changed lane it didn‚Äôt work i did what i could possibly think of nothing worked,btohqsg
I know it‚Äôs annoying but try ignore him next time and drive at ur comfortable pace,btohqsg
See how long he can tahan,btohqsg
Family safety more important bro   not worth ur time playing with such driver,btohqsg
Tbh if I alone I would have done it,btohqsg
I forgot his family in the car,btohqsg
you should stay off the fucking roads,btohqsg
that is NOT a mentality anyone should have,btohqsg
you're taking 1.5 ton machines and slamming hard on the brakes on the fastest expressway in SG,btohqsg
Like I wouldn't brake like that la,btohqsg
if you don't cause an accident with the person behind  the chain reaction would.,btohqsg
But I would slow down drastically enough to tell him that I know what he's doing,btohqsg
i'm sure you're dense enough to not understand the whole point of this,btohqsg
and if there's a car behind?,btohqsg
get your class 3 then pipe in.,btohqsg
nothing hilarious about risking the safety of other road users,btohqsg
they have families and friends to return home to,btohqsg
if you can't be arsed to think about that for a second  please re-evaluate your morals and your standing in society.,btohqsg
Sorry for the bad lighting angle,btohqsg
yea i guess thats true said,btohqsg
If you are on lane 1  you better be overtaking cars on lane 2. Cause it is an overtaking lane on the expressway.If you are cruising the speed limit on lane 1  you are road hogging. Always give way to faster vehicles on lane 1 regardless of what speed you/they are going at.You can be doing 140km/hr  clear road ahead of you but if the vehicle behind is faster than you and you don't move aside  you are a road hogger.Yes road speed limit is 90km/h  by virtue that is the limit but the overtaking lane is suppose to facilitate overtaking even if speeding is required cause you will have bad road users who are on the wrong lane at the wrong speeds.If you are not overtaking anyone then don't use lane 1. If there is someone faster behind you  move off. Basic stuff and road etiquette.,btohqsg
7pm i was going at least 110 first lane   i find that reasonable . maybe I‚Äôm wrong   i dont know   whats ur opinion on the minimum speed required to be on the first lane ? and as per mentioned i did move over to lane 2 . he just continued to poke me instead of just overtaking me from lane 1 .,btohqsg
minimum speed would be overtaking speed,btohqsg
on other lanes 2 3 and 4 am i right   yes i was,btohqsg
Speed limit and higher for overtaking lane  as explained above. If you have to ask this again  means need to read the above again. There is no Minimum speeds. Only laws governing the type of lanes and max speed. If you are travelling slower than other traffic  you have to keep to the left side of the road as much as possible. It is an offence to road hog as well. That is why when you are a L plate driver. They always tell you keep leftIt is better to move off the overtaking lane and let him be. He just wasting his time. You were road hogging lane one  move off and go at speed limit at lane 2  you are fine and he is just being an r-tard if he is disturbing you.It is funny  if you were truly cautious on safety you would really use the overtaking lane with your family or passengers. Is not ideal to go over the speed limit.The other possible thing.. was your headlights on.,btohqsg
"Likewise don't understand why people respond to ""pokes"" by going for it at 130-140 with family members in the car if they aren't comfortable",btohqsg
I‚Äôve moved over   braked   don‚Äôt understand why he still tailed me,btohqsg
Why get so affected by him tailgating or poking  if you pay heed to it and react he will continue  can just ignore bah,btohqsg
drive faster till you drop him,btohqsg
Sure one person being an asshole,btohqsg
But you don't have to get affected by them and make your passenger uncomfortable and put their safety in jeopardy,btohqsg
Just wait until they pass and get on with life,btohqsg
It always takes 2 hands to clap,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just saying   you drive a white audi too,btohqsg
Also don't drive a white Audi anymore,btohqsg
about a year late to the news i suppose,btohqsg
it's now a white Audi Q3,btohqsg
It is a white golf with lifted suspension,btohqsg
If someone does that to you next time,btohqsg
Don't speed and try to drop them or lose them,btohqsg
They'll lose patience to poke at some point when they don't get a reaction and move,btohqsg
perhaps it was such a tense situation at that point of moment   i alr did what i could possibly think off,btohqsg
Also you're lucky you didn't get clocked,btohqsg
And the highway patrol 3 series on shoulders,btohqsg
Can someone help update in the other group,btohqsg
Jam brake  claim a shit ton of insurance,btohqsg
anybody wants a free photoshoot of their cars? here‚Äôs one i did of my mums vw sportsvan. i‚Äôm kinda bored atm lol,btohqsg
kinda got lost n walked into the dormsüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
we walk to the kranji dorm entrance,btohqsg
gmaps led us to the wrong way psps,btohqsg
whr uh im abit lost icl,btohqsg
Cant find the event where is it?,btohqsg
i looking for things to buy,btohqsg
what can i use it for,btohqsg
Who at timmac? Can take photo?,btohqsg

why does it look bent upwards on the rear,btohqsg
oh christian‚Äôs one was at the meet yest,btohqsg
Guys 918 car rental services can trust?,btohqsg
Guys don‚Äôt go nex mall and take pictures of car at the carpark there today,btohqsg
Fr we take pic there got 1 guy not happy,btohqsg
He the owner of the car,btohqsg
then that one if he dw then dw lo,btohqsg
He don‚Äôt want people take pic of his car and threaten to whack me and my friend face ask us enter his car also,btohqsg
he threaten to whack then ask u go in his car??,btohqsg
lol spot car also dunno what car,btohqsg
> goes to normal shopping mall to take pics of random cars> gets scolded for taking pics of random carsdeserved it ngl,btohqsg
if you owned a normal car you wouldn't want random kids taking pics of your car lol,btohqsg
just take shots at actual carspotting locations to avoid this in future lol,btohqsg
just because you are doesn't mean everyone else is,btohqsg
Tbh it not completely our fault because most of the owner will notGet mad,btohqsg
yes the driver shouldn't have threatened to whack you guys  but you indirectly incited it by taking pictures at a random ass carpark,btohqsg
not everyone gets mad  but there will be a high chance of displeasure.,btohqsg
Now I am starting to think he is mad because my friend took video of his car and his face,btohqsg
waheyy! you've connected the dots now  that's something you should've done long ago,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt take video but I kenna,btohqsg
need to be like AJ PHOTOS AJ PHOTOS,btohqsg
birds of a feather flock together.,btohqsg
bro. if u take ppl of non car enthu cars  they will think u taking pic to trend on social media or to report smt. and now that u say that your friend take vid of the guy's face also  cnfm not happy lor,btohqsg
There is nothing that prevents you from taking a photo of someone‚Äôs car in a public space. The car owner can politely ask you not to do it  but there is no legal obligation to not do it,btohqsg
yall tgt mah  and also Im guessing yall are pretty young? so he knows if he makes threats like this yall cnfm scared,btohqsg
ya sia heard he OPEN FOR SHOOTS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è,btohqsg
We even told him we can delete the photo we apologised nicely,btohqsg
He still said no no no you get in now I will whack your face,btohqsg
IMO this is the right thing to do if someone asks you not to take a photo of their car. But he should not be rude or aggressive,btohqsg
Probably one of those siao lang pple,btohqsg
he shouldnt have threatened yall  but j be cautious next time ah bro,btohqsg
Bro every 13 year old twitch streamer and her dog got tattoo now,btohqsg
or maybe he do something wrong  or running from someone/authority so when see ppl take photo then become paranoid and threaten to whack,btohqsg
"ending a sentence with ""cuh"" tells me all i need to know",btohqsg
Possible. But theres thousands of cctv on the roads and in car parks so he‚Äôs already nailed,btohqsg
"not exactly ""nice"" to randomly take videos of people's cars",btohqsg
especially at a random ass mall like Nex,btohqsg
yeah youre right but maybe he nv think and just running or sumn haha just a guess  could be completely off,btohqsg
Thats why i dont agree with this ‚Äòdont take pic of my car‚Äô bs. Like bro  out on the road a few thousand people already got me on cctv and dash cam,btohqsg
dw bro not that deep one@ArghMeinGottjust boomer,btohqsg
i think you're missing the point i mentioned before,btohqsg
just because it isn't your thing doesn't mean it isn't going to piss off others,btohqsg
the best solution to all conflicts is to avoid it in the first place,btohqsg
in this case  no cure  straight to the conflict.,btohqsg
I happen to think that a person taking a pic of someones car is most times nice,btohqsg
Unless he had an ulterior motive  why second guess something like that?,btohqsg
If you go on Instagram  YouTube  or other social media platforms you will realise that many people also do the same,btohqsg
just because they can do it doesn't mean it butters all the breads,btohqsg
just because someone can run into traffic and yell racial slurs on socmed doesn't mean you can either,btohqsg
if you want to have a platform,btohqsg
It not nice it not bad is just what the owner of the car think,btohqsg
Some will appreciate it  some wont. Its not illegal  i say do what you want  and be nice to each other  problem solved,btohqsg
don't walk inside random ass carparks to shoot,btohqsg
We just pass by and saw it,btohqsg
go to a proper meet and take pics,btohqsg
yes snapping videos in public and whatnot isn't illegal,btohqsg
but you aren't putting yourself into other's shoes,btohqsg
there will always be someone that doesn't like it  factor that in and don't act surprised when it does happen üëç,btohqsg
bro most of the time non car enthus wouldnt think that youre taking photos of their cars because you like the car  they would think that youre doing it with malicious intent,btohqsg
when someone takes photos of our cars  we would think its nice but not to (most) non car enthus man,btohqsg
Sorry but if your car is just parked there and some guy in a car park who obviously isnt a parking warden just stands there and takes a pic and walks away minding his own business im pretty sure what you are saying above is not true,btohqsg
i suppose you can put it this way,btohqsg
someone brings a dslr to your hdb block,btohqsg
starts taking photos of every unit,btohqsg
Taking photos in corridors is perfectly legal. But the moment it encroaches into private space this now becomes a legal issue. So your analogy doesnt work,btohqsg
i don't think you get the jist here,btohqsg
why wouldnt it be? nowadays so many vigilantes trending ppl car for the smallest reasons so maybe the person had their guard up?,btohqsg
The sitting on and leaning on and touching to me is flat out disgusting,btohqsg
I think if a person were to think this way by default when someone takes a pic of his car  issues lie more with him than the person taking the picture,btohqsg
but hes saying that he didnt really like the random ppl taking photos of his car. thats the point though  because maybe the person that took photos of his car liked the car or wtv but that wouldnt be the first thought that comes to mind if youre not a car enthusiast imo,btohqsg
once again  it's not about whether it's their issues or not. it's in general,btohqsg
nowadays ppl paranoid bro  what to do,btohqsg
i think you should look at it from a broader stance as opposed to just your own standpoint,btohqsg
we cannot change how ppl think  but we can change our actions,btohqsg
Like i said at the beginning  know whats legal and within your rights and just be polite  whether you are the car owner or the dude taking the pic. Then all problems are avoided and everyone is happy,btohqsg
as i said just now  the best solution  is to avoid it to begin with,btohqsg
it's not about whether it's legal or not  it's about how it is perceived by everyone,btohqsg
Just do bear in mind everything you said is also just your own viewpoint,btohqsg
just because it's legal to fuck a prostitute doesn't mean everyone wants to,btohqsg
Dont pass your opinion off as speaking for everyone. I definitely wont,btohqsg
i'm sorry but this isn't an opinion  it's a fact.,btohqsg
The fact is nothing the dude did is illegal so he can do it,btohqsg
i'm sure you're not trolling  but if you are then that's a good troll üëç,btohqsg

but there is a porsche 911 that lives nearby my place i saw it in the carpark multiple times,btohqsg
plate and the car goes hand in hand,btohqsg
That's why my main focus was more on the carplate,btohqsg
