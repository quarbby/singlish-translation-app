When I reverse  I can see through the touch screen . But the line just Mia,btohqsg
The general guide lines or the moving proximity warning lines.,btohqsg
Just now I was driving around playing PokÃ©mon,btohqsg
Then come back home   the sensor not working liao,btohqsg
But I was driving very slow just now,btohqsg
Do you think the sensor is dirty?,btohqsg
Maybe I drive in to ask the workshop to check tomorrow,btohqsg
If sensor is dirty it would be permanently detecting close proximity,btohqsg
All 4 sensors shouldnâ€™t fail at the same time,btohqsg
Let us know how it goes!,btohqsg
What are the chances of all 4 sensor stopped working at the same time,btohqsg
Maybe later I go and clean the sensor and see if it is functional,btohqsg
Good to do anyway coz it can sometimes be due to dirt,btohqsg
If not got to go down to the workshop tomorrow,btohqsg

Kinda like those joker from medieval times,btohqsg
okay let me give you a legit answerðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
basically u press brake cos in an unlikely event the engine starts and the cars starts to move  the brake being held will prevent the car from moving,btohqsg
Actually if you see what the P Gear looks like  its actually this very small catch,btohqsg
He has always been nice to me,btohqsg
in the very unlikely event the P Gear is broken lor,btohqsg
(In the event the P gear is faulty)some people brake to a halt on a level surface and turn off their car. When they start the car  the car will inch out cos the P Gear is faulty,btohqsg
come on la dont act like a gundu i know you are smarter than that,btohqsg
thats why people always say put the car into neutral  handbrake then put the car into P,btohqsg
Tie the car to the carpark,btohqsg
but personally i cldnt give 2 f*cks la ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
so no need care one la this is just a safety precaution,btohqsg
If everybody can understand and only you cannot  im starting to think its a YOU problem.,btohqsg

To ensure that the vehicle remains stationary and under control before the engine starts  reducing the risk of accidents.,btohqsg
