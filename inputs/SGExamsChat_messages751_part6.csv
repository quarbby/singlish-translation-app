this isnt a good conclusion even for gp essay standards,btohqsg
But i thought 3h2 and gp must be taken tgy,btohqsg
No  itâ€™s just that you canâ€™t use it to improve your rp,btohqsg
You can register for one subject only  no one is stopping you,btohqsg
Which is why I want to do it for Econs,btohqsg
Maybe i should take h1 h2 and h3 bio,btohqsg
the one i teach is normally1. Reiterate Stand + Thesis Statement (Short Summary distilling the main points out to overall answer the qn)2. Call for the future/Projection for the future (Attempt at problematising the question)3. Thematic coherence (Link to intro/body paragraph components --> But tbf this is normally cause i try to ensure thematic coherence throughout my essay),btohqsg
Then that one cannot in one sitting lol. And h3 can only be done in sch,btohqsg
Ik  take h2 and h3 in 2025. Then do h1 as priv,btohqsg
i dont like ks bull essays,btohqsg
memory can only get u so far,btohqsg
Idl how my RI friends say that if ur essay is not in KS bull ur essay is considered a failure in the eyes of the sch,btohqsg
Good luck  cos even if your bio is rly good canâ€™t afford to screw up other subjects during promos,btohqsg
huh so essentially what i said,btohqsg
i just nvr summarise my pts,btohqsg
My Econs tutor said he wanted to take Econs S paper (the equivalent of H3 now)  but couldnâ€™t even though he was the top in cohort cos he failed math,btohqsg
theres a call for the future and thematic coherence no?,btohqsg
thematic coherence is hard to judge,btohqsg
so what i mean for example is,btohqsg
Wah i didnt know mindfulness trg can help. The dr did show me some vid of itðŸ¤£I need to get out of feeling perpetually tired  i dun feel like how young i amðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
i wrote this essay before about how men more than women is hindered by tradition. Then i played on the chinese phrase of the phoenix vs dragon (wang zi cheng long  wang nv cheng feng) throughout the whole essay,btohqsg
so my every body para i would incorporate the phoenix and dragon motifs,btohqsg
then i ended with it in my conclusion,btohqsg
tahts what i mean by thematic coherence,btohqsg
For languages yesâ€¦i feel u want to memo aso need to know where can u apply it to and not like force it into everything,btohqsg
if not i read the essay is like theres nth that stands out,btohqsg
Is there anything in h1 bio thatâ€™s not in h2? Just like h2 hist,btohqsg
But wun there be a lot of overlap,btohqsg
Alot of the contents learn in h2 are suggest qns in h1,btohqsg
Just take the ppr for fun,btohqsg
Or do bFM + random contrasting,btohqsg
For me i think idh bandwithâ€¦BUT TBH h1 seem like easier than os,btohqsg

Oh btw my ct say bio and history together ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
My (1 half) ct only good subject is gpðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
My ct looks short next to the boy,btohqsg
I think mindfulness is a generally useful practice that is worth exploring. When I was first exposed to it  I was internally a rather fiery  arrogant and impatient person and I was not open to advice and help. Over the years  I mellowed as a person and grew more receptive to external voices. And it is then that mindfulness practices become something helpful â€” it is kinda a chicken-and-egg which-comes-first journey for me â€¦,btohqsg
a bad person from discord got banned,btohqsg
FR ah can't find ah rip,btohqsg

Can pm me the name of the cher you got,btohqsg

Brahm Centre aims to promote happier and healthier living through mindfulness practice  so it is inevitable for them to talk about mindfulness ah. Even though it provides counselling services  it is after all not a family service centre or a social services officeI hold the opinion that for a person to reap the benefit of mindfulness  one has to have a certain level of maturity. Then again  I can see how mindfulness can help one build self-awareness and mental resilience so introducing it to a young person is actually good â€” whether the person can reap the benefit is another thing altogetherLastly  how effective the session or sharing also depends on the facilitator. I donâ€™t assume that everyone is a good mindfulness coach or facilitator,btohqsg
our foolscaps are in foolscap heaven,btohqsg
Hmmmm I donâ€™t think it is BCâ€™s agenda to push for academic excellence. It is not a tuition centre  it is not even Sinda/Cdac/MendakiThen maybe it sounds like not up BCâ€™s alley to be running such a programme?,btohqsg
I think it is more like â€¦ stress and poor mental wellness in general can be alleviated with mindfulness practices; and stress from academics can be further reduced if there is academic help,btohqsg
