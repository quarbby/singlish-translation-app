Hi experts!Just wanna clarify. Can I stack my miles if I purchase an ip16 pro max from Kris shop & use either DBS WWC or Citi rewards? üòä,btohqsg
Yes but note on the card cap dbs woman 1.5k and citi reward 1k only. 4+2 mpd,btohqsg
Reaching end of month  suggest don't put any monies in first. But you can register for this month one in case next month's promo has a lower interest rate.,btohqsg
reference month is Sep with $0. Can deposit now and enjoy the 3.x% on the Oct/Nov/Dec ADB.,btohqsg
Oh I got in the same statement  3 months after card arrived,btohqsg
Hi any update on the HSBC EGA giro payment 1% cashback? So far not received anything üòî,btohqsg
For HSBC credit card   any promo/ cashback for the entertainer card ?,btohqsg
Is it usually recommended to double down on miles  or balance out cashback and miles?Case in point  I am looking to get a ocbc cc for my 360 account.Currently have (applied) for a crmc and planning ahead for either a ocbc infinity or ocbc 90N  mainly for 500min spend and when/if my crmc caps 1k. Also for big ticket items since its uncap.I also understand that 90N can choose miles or cashback  albeit at a lower rate of 1.2 vs infinity's 1.6.Also  if 90N  is it recommended for visa or master? Normally I'll auto pick master for cardup  but most of my current cards are master  wonder if I should pick visa to balance things out (e.g. For certain countries where master less accepted)Would love to hear some insights or perspectives to help me consider between the two  in case I missed anything. Ty!,btohqsg
Damn  long wall of text haha...,btohqsg
thought visa has better promo code for cardup?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Ah I could've read wrongly (was ipaymy)   ignore that point then!,btohqsg
Us Esta payment (mcc 9399) should work with Uob absolute Amex right?,btohqsg
But I guess don‚Äôt make sense to incur the 4% Cost.Might as well use YouTrip with zero rewards but small fx cost.,btohqsg
Is Klook considered as travel related?,btohqsg
Most of the time yes. Which card are you looking at?,btohqsg
Don't use it for klook haha,btohqsg
Buy Klook vouchers on heymax insteadüòÇ,btohqsg
Take note you have to load up the vouchers in your profile (usually by the site)  not directly in the Klook booking,btohqsg
Both interest and cashback also no come ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
üò∞ should be soon?Both me & wife account all get liao.,btohqsg
I only got EGA bonus for jul/Aug  still no cashback for giro since 11 oct,btohqsg
Weird the GIRO 1% I always get it the next working day.,btohqsg
You got the 1% cashback from recent giro after 10 Oct?  I just checked and still don‚Äôt have ü•≤,btohqsg
Yeah  still no 1% for me  but then again the 'wrong' amount credited earlier this month is still way more than what is owed to me... so still net positive ü§£,btohqsg
I just checked earlier. I was told that their cashback system is facing some issues,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in negative territory despite the ‚Äúaccidentals‚Äùcos many giro went through‚Ä¶lol not gd,btohqsg
My GIRO only deducts 24th/25th monthly  will know soon. üòÖ,btohqsg
I asked the HsBC cso why the 1% cashback is not in and s/he said usually it needs 14 business days. Obviously that‚Äôs a template answer coz i always got it a day after money is withdrawn! üòí,btohqsg
Yes. Last time I also kenna 1 time is almost 10 days then they credit.,btohqsg
When was this? Last month? Mine stopped on oct 10. If it is really their system having issue  now i start wondering if the bonus interest they give is actually calculated correctly or not.,btohqsg
Quite long ago. Maybe half a year ago.Yeah. I also feel like they never calculate correctly. üòÖAlso the RM last time told us to double check also  if not correct can tell them.That‚Äôs what made me scared lol.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just sian if they stop the giro 1% cash back. But they should announce on website if they intend to stop right?Could be technical issues,btohqsg
"Should be..If not ""enough""  then tell them",btohqsg
Frankly I tried tracking before and gave up. The amounts are not aligned by giro payments. Sometimes they lump sum etc,btohqsg
I also havent receive the interest üò≠nv receive giro cashback also since 8oct...,btohqsg
"Their ""everyday"" rewards not coming in everyday liao üòÇ",btohqsg
Interest got chance. I just received July August bonus.The giro cash back no sound since 10 October for me,btohqsg
Hi  may I know which credit card are the best to pay for MCC 7011  7012 and 3501 to 3999,btohqsg
Still eager to know whether enforcement of the new July clause of HSBC EGA is done...https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/215497,btohqsg
Just wondering if it was enforced... i also duno how to affirm,btohqsg
Remember there were huge discussion back in July when the clause was added? üòÖ,btohqsg
This is not about giro right?,btohqsg
Oh gosh  such a big bank but with lousy system. The 1% cashback from giro is still easy to calculate but not the ega interest üòì,btohqsg
my own experience thus far is NO..and that time i already pointed out it is impossible to enforce unless your account does NOTHING except just park money..no transaction no salary no payments,btohqsg
Nope  not giro. Its about the 30day fresh fund thingie.,btohqsg
singtel kiosk can pay what bill?,btohqsg
This month's bonus interest is supposedly the first time this clause is being tested,btohqsg
I tried before and gave up. Impossible lol.Last time they said can see from statement what is the MAB  but then later said only the RM can see. So if you want  must keep calling them to check what is your MAB for that month.,btohqsg
Means still a long wait‚Ä¶ üòÇ,btohqsg
