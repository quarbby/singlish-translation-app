must make it halal for you,btohqsg
meaning not carbonara that has pork,btohqsg
guys how much is an acceptable range for ur friend to treat u,btohqsg
i‚Äôve treated my friends hdl before,btohqsg
ok well my dear friend siyan treated me to a $47 meal,btohqsg
without occasion maybe 20ish quite ok,btohqsg
but not often  if the usual often kind then 10,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not particular so my treating is like,btohqsg
i just pay for us together,btohqsg
and don‚Äôt bother asking it back,btohqsg
so u don‚Äôt tell them like ‚Äòeh my treat‚Äô,btohqsg
u js do it after ah,btohqsg
then when they ask how much,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just like no need la,btohqsg
atp siyan can open his hall for a 10 course meal or smth la,btohqsg
how would u even heat up carbonara,btohqsg
store packed carbonara sauce fAKE as hell,btohqsg
that used to be a problem when i first tried making carbonara,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not store packed but ppl say I‚Äôm fake,btohqsg
then i figured out how to make carbonara without having the egg solidify,btohqsg
last i made i think my spaghetti was sitting in a pool of sauce,btohqsg
I came out of my moms vagina,btohqsg
last I made spaghetti was never,btohqsg
u sit in sauce  i sit in restaurant,btohqsg
still felt that it was too watery,btohqsg
the consistency of carbonara is rlly hard to get,btohqsg
my brain proceeded carbonara as bolognese,btohqsg
but its hard to nail the full flavours,btohqsg
a few more months then u get ur uni concession lo,btohqsg
whoever in ntu i treat meal,btohqsg
maybe if i lazy cook just go out eat,btohqsg

Need ask the 16 yr old kid,btohqsg
Certainly  here are some tips for talking to women:1 Approach with respect: Treat the woman with respect and approach her with a friendly and positive attitude.2 Listen actively: Listen attentively to what she says and respond thoughtfully. Avoid interrupting her or dominating the conversation.3 Show interest: Show genuine interest in her thoughts  opinions  and experiences. Ask open-ended questions that allow her to share more about herself.4 Be confident: Confidence is attractive  so be confident in yourself and your ability to hold a conversation. Avoid bragging or trying too hard to impress her.5 Avoid sensitive topics: Avoid topics that are potentially sensitive or controversial  such as politics  religion  or ex-partners.6 Pay attention to body language: Pay attention to her body language and respond accordingly. If she seems uncomfortable or disinterested  it may be best to end the conversation.7 Practice empathy: Try to see things from her perspective and be empathetic. This can help build trust and rapport.Remember  every person is unique and may have different preferences when it comes to conversation. The key is to be respectful  listen actively  and show genuine interest in what she has to say.,btohqsg
