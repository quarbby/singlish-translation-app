Your Morning Quick Read-  July 21 2021Rebound over FearInvestors appeared to shook off Monday's fear as they activated risk-on mode. It has been a classic buy the dip in the current bull market. The dark clouds that are gathering on the horizon should not be ignored. Yet  as of now  investors are satisfied with the music to the ears: the plenty stimulus and liquidity  confident consumers with enormous savings and the willingness to spend to support pent-up demand.Then  there is a factored-in blockbuster earnings growth that we can expect as the virus remains controlled. Against this backdrop  the bear has a challenging story to sell.Major indices had a good runWe saw Dow jumped by 1.6% after its worst loss for the year on Monday. The S&P added 1.5%  while Nasdaq climbed 1.6%. The Russell 2000 recovered part of its for the last week with a display of over 3% gain for the day.Will we continue to see the stability till the end of the week? It is something we are praying for.Earnings are thus far  goodThe latest earnings results appear to be on the rosy side  although the just-released Netflix earnings may have some disappointment. However  it seems that the company can still absorb the subscriber's growth with a focus on game streaming in the near term.Pika World's favorite Chipotle (due to its innovative Cauliflower rice offering) is rocketing. The burrito chain had delivered positive second-quarter results  and the CFO is said to be optimistic about the growth ahead as it looks forward to a post-pandemic world.The adjusted EPS was $7.46  well ahead of the $6.53 expectation. Remarkably  same-store sales rose by 31.2%  also above the 30% mark of expectation. In addition  the company had opened 56 new restaurants and with additional drive-through options.There are also signs of strength in its digital sales even when the restaurants are open for dine-in  an insight that we cannot miss. Simply put  consumers behaviour in the pandemic era might be stickier than we thought  and take-out options continue to be a popular choice.What's on the menu today?It is a light data day!At 10.30 pm  we will welcome the Crude Oil Inventories  which we expect a drawdown of 4.466m compared to 7.897m.While the rebound was intense  it only gets better if the music continues. So  stay light and nimble.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
