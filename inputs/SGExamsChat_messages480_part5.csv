i always slept for at least 6h everyday,btohqsg

Anyway I welcome all Malaysian who wanna be better in sg  youâ€™re all our brother and sister,btohqsg
Unless yâ€™all try to Siam NS or try cheat the system then go back Malaysia do that,btohqsg
Anyway you should consider if you donâ€™t get citizenship just apply for other country citizenship if you can make it,btohqsg
If you alr choose Singapore then I guess welcome,btohqsg
But if I were you maybe pick Australia lol,btohqsg
You didnâ€™t need to serve Mah,btohqsg
You can Siam and study in aus and get their Pr,btohqsg
If cannot then just renounce and hide in Malaysia,btohqsg
Come work here on Epass basis,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just saying that if you played your card right can Siam one,btohqsg
But you are those legit ppl,btohqsg
Lol your mum not the one doing NS,btohqsg
Why they apply pr for you in the first place,btohqsg
Not like very hard to get PR even after ns age,btohqsg
Either you do after ns age and become PR  or you citizen all the way,btohqsg
Idk why they do this half and half very weird,btohqsg
Anw you born here why you not citizen?,btohqsg
Your parents a bit dumb la,btohqsg
Now you got some headaches cos of this weird scenario,btohqsg
If you gonna born here study here do ns here,btohqsg
If you wanna Siam ns and be pr why not just not apply then Siam then apply PR when you after ns age,btohqsg
Donâ€™t do this oh I wanna be pr and do ns,btohqsg
Tell them you will bleed for the nation  but they keep deny your citizenship,btohqsg
A lot of non ns serving pr also become citizen,btohqsg
So for you I think no problem,btohqsg
Anyway Iâ€™m glad Ns now not so rabak,btohqsg
If I did ns in 2004 maybe im the ghost you will hear about,btohqsg
2014 I alr think Fd up,btohqsg
Canâ€™t imagine 1994 or 1984 ns,btohqsg
Is it? Wah sounds good sia,btohqsg
I think social media have a big part to play,btohqsg
Nowadays if you not happy just do some TikTok exposure,btohqsg
Whole nation will ask how come defense spend so high but food so shit,btohqsg
Before all this I think no unified voices,btohqsg
If itâ€™s up to me I will ask why defense spending higher than healthcare and nsf pay still so low,btohqsg
I will also ask why threaten ppl to rate good? If itâ€™s not good why have rating system,btohqsg
I mean I believe that defense important so thatâ€™s why treat people fairly lol,btohqsg
If not next time got war at most ppl will post thoughts and prayers after they run away,btohqsg
If you treat ppl fairly they will die for the nation,btohqsg
If you treat like shit ppl will chao keng and run,btohqsg
In unit I felt treated fairly (relative to BMT and training sch) so I quite happy to do sai kang,btohqsg
Eh I donâ€™t care la  not my job to fix saf. If war come and the population not loyal they only have themselves to blame,btohqsg
