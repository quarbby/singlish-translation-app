My side is the atas ntuc üòÇ,btohqsg
the best mint goes into a white mentol tobacco stick,btohqsg
Maybe they might like it? Different ppl different taste,btohqsg

Ok.. but need to wait coz I seldom go down the mountain,btohqsg
meaning you can only say 1 line per 15 mins,btohqsg
But that almost means they will be the safest HAHA,btohqsg
OH doesn‚Äôt matter just wanted to see what are they saying or like their line of thought haha,btohqsg
there are 2 kinds of unvaxed people,btohqsg
those who are not eligible to get vax because of medical allegy/condition  and those who refuse to get vax because of ideology,btohqsg
Pm me if got link haha thanks in advance guys,btohqsg
pak jiam buay? meh meh pak! lol,btohqsg
vaccinations are paid for by taxpayers (in particular the pioneer generation and merdeka generation contributed lots of GST taxes into our reserves),btohqsg
But out of stock MaA lot people cannot get,btohqsg
Many countries people kill to get vaccinated,btohqsg
Quite pitiful I see my friends cannot vac cuz of allergy,btohqsg
those kena ICU won't think its not serious. poor things,btohqsg
my own brother refuse to get vax and even deny his daughters to get vaxed. His wife gotten vaxed and this is a disagreement of ideology to them,btohqsg
They should sign their rights away for medical help,btohqsg
Hmmm. Sometimes the fear quite bad.. I ever got a patient.She saw me prep the vaccine. She ran out of the room üòÖ,btohqsg
lol  i saw a few hilarious tiktoks of scare kena poke,btohqsg
one is an old man  keep scolding vulgarity when drag to get vax,btohqsg

Tbh. The gov should officially make it mandatory la..They say not mandatory. But then their measures‚Ä¶ lol,btohqsg
"must give the people ""the illusion of choice""",btohqsg
That‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs just an illusion,btohqsg
IkrJust make mandatoryWhen we were babies got so many mandatory jabs leDunno why can‚Äôt just make this mandatory,btohqsg
the illusion of choice is also used as an artful sales tactic,btohqsg
The argument is tt cos it‚Äôs supposed to be new tech..But the rate they are going. Everyone is gonna be vaccinated anyway.,btohqsg
Thts why I feel those who dun want to vax should sign their rights to medical help away lor,btohqsg
i dont blame anti vax because so many deaths from vax alr,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not denying tt it is new.But just cos it‚Äôs new doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dangerous. Previously. Vaccines n medications take a lot of time to develop cos of red tape etc.this was developed fast due to the cooperation internationally.The only thing tt cannot be determined if there will be long term effects.But tt argument can be made for any medications ar‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Death from vac? Or death from covid? Very big diff wor,btohqsg
Hahah. If it‚Äôs covid related la.Cannot be other medical rights also dun give them Ma,btohqsg

Errr u do know tt..They include all deaths after vaccination within a time frame.It does not necessarily means it‚Äôs related to the vaccine,btohqsg
