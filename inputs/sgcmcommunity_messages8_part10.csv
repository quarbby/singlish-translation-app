LOW maintenance.. Not NO maintenance.Brake checks Battery checks Charging socket checks Tires Wiper blades and fluidsAir intake checksBattery coolant checks too,btohqsg
actually the main conern is direct selling,btohqsg
the dealers actually tried to stop tesla from selling directly in usa but failed. more states are now opening up,btohqsg
even the traditional old state texas with strong lobby cannot stop,btohqsg
and F and Gm are changing to selling this way. it is the only way to improve margins. tesla does all without advertising and dealers,btohqsg
Ya transparent  straight forward   nothing to alibaba,btohqsg
Oh Alibaba! (ﾉ°_o)ﾉ⌒┫ ┻ ┣ ┳┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) such a morass of words!,btohqsg
If a car requires a maintenance every 2 years then it’s as good as low or no maintenance,btohqsg
Yea and it is like a laser printer. Mothball for like 3 or 6 months it will still runs very well. iCE wise better check before running lol,btohqsg

The best engineer ceo is Elon musk. No modern auto ceos is like him,btohqsg
Double trouble somemore. But the clone account was deleted.Well  that's their SOP. If you waste their time  that gonna p*ss them to real good.,btohqsg
Yeah. Entertain at least to say no interest in whatever shit they offer.,btohqsg
You definitely know what happened next HAHAHA,btohqsg
Oh I got this kind another day and the person asked me to pm him. I told him chat here (group chat) so that everyone can see,btohqsg
Sadly they are still operating because people still fell for it.,btohqsg
But knowing my number won’t help them much so long as you don’t disclose secrets. I got tons of fake calls flaming them to be from health authorities singpost I cometax etx,btohqsg
They can’t go far. When I asked them“Who do you want to speak to”? This floored them scammers,btohqsg
When I feel bored I play with them to trap them.,btohqsg
I'm on the spf website... They don't report any WhatsApp stocks Scam...?,btohqsg
One got so angry call me that I’ve been wasting her time,btohqsg
Hilarious. Ask me buy a stock that’s been pumped up. I said ok. I’ll sell short then. Next few days stock crashed,btohqsg
I kenna before. I politely said no time  ask them to call another day… they really called me another day… then i said not interested  and the person scolded me,btohqsg
"Haha this is nice. What's ""her' reply?",btohqsg
She is hilarious. And well stupid. In an attempt to impress me she says she has a Maserati sports car. But chauffeured around. This is Hk china scam using hk as office,btohqsg
Maserati sports car but chaffeured around.. what bullshit,btohqsg
Mebbe her scam persona is a tai-tai.,btohqsg
I know but she’s clearly referring to non ghibli,btohqsg
Even if got four door  also won’t be for chauffeuring,btohqsg
This one I encountered in 2019. Scammer added me in their cryptos scam started by Charles Li. All actors inside. So fake. Everyone in agreement with the main scammer on how to invest to make money. I exposed them. And then I got booted out.,btohqsg
Great to troll them when bored.,btohqsg
One thing I don’t know why scammers like to use +852 number. Is it because it’s more credible as it’s financial center,btohqsg
I also have but when I clicked on the profile  got legit handle/telegram ID  not blank.,btohqsg
Tell him u want a kiao ka job,btohqsg
Got inspired since y're all playing around... So I decided to see what results.,btohqsg
Hahaha… the spammers must be thinking what is happening today,btohqsg
Wonder if they'll show up for a virtual interview. Make it accessible for them. Don't make it WebEx or Teams or Meet... Use Zoom.,btohqsg
Yeah. We deleted a whole bunch of spam accounts earlier. We try to minimise spam for our members to the best of our ability.,btohqsg
why a V8 with such huge cc,btohqsg
Because they can lah. Am sure they know their clientele or have done their research. Anyhow  enjoyed the YT link. Ta for posting! (Maybe someone has a more educated answer),btohqsg
乁ʕ •̀ ۝ •́ ʔㄏit does sound a tad excessive ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,btohqsg
bmw v8 is not that big cc. only 4 liter or less than 5 liter,btohqsg
a bmw v10 is not evem 6 liter\,btohqsg
I’ve been checking the Tesla site. Seems Macao is selling a lot cheaper than hongkong. Why?,btohqsg
No  Macau is only 118 sq km. Both Hong Kong & Macau have no VAT/GST.,btohqsg
Hk also alot of tesla maybe cheap also,btohqsg
Yes. Hk got a lot of Tesla… their petrol price is very high  carpark price also very high… u can even buy carpark lots and rent out,btohqsg
HK is more expensive than macao,btohqsg
then why NIO is stupid to do swapping of batteries? so expensive costs,btohqsg
