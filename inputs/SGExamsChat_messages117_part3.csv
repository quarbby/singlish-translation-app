Hello! Does anyone knows how do I take a minor in NUS?,btohqsg
Or just apply for a minor/second major during matriculation straight,btohqsg
Is there any CAP/ A lvls requirement?,btohqsg
Cap requirement is mostly for double degree,btohqsg
Hmm then why when we apply to NUS  Double Major is harder to get in ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Direct matriculation yes they need higher a level requirement,btohqsg
But when u want to do minor/second major during like ur 2nd year theres no requirement,btohqsg
So if u donâ€™t get accepted for a particular double major on application  you just have to declare the second major once you enter year 2?,btohqsg
U can declare it anytime before u graduate as long as u clear the required mods,btohqsg
So wats the point of applying for double major with A Levels results,btohqsg
Because there is no guarantee u can get the mods u want for ur second major,btohqsg
This applies to double degree too right?,btohqsg
U have less priority cause it is treated as a UE,btohqsg
