Cos is the fastest way to clear student debt,btohqsg
Actually what’s your policy for students who don’t pay attention,btohqsg
The thing is... they don't... they all pay attention,btohqsg
Like first lesson i will spend extra 30-45mins to talk a bit about my journey as a student,btohqsg
So you give a pep talk before every session,btohqsg
Rather than u just piss off after the end of 1st lesson,btohqsg
TIP training was valuable after all,btohqsg
The student will still see u as a stranger in 2nd lesson,btohqsg
I did it way before TIP,btohqsg
TIP workshop didnt teach much tbh,btohqsg
Cause they’re not interested in the work,btohqsg
sgeducator is a legit tutor grp or they trolling,btohqsg
Well i just told them if u are not keen in doing well in the subject  u shouldnt take tuition,btohqsg
I just tell them straight in the face,btohqsg
They’re trying to be legit but right now half the people there talking are the alts of one guy,btohqsg
Its prob legit  but i aint gonna talk in there,btohqsg
Yes  thats why students are dropped if they really dont give a fkIn my 2 yrs so far that only happened for 1 person,btohqsg
What does 'legit' mean to you,btohqsg
Who isnt interested to do well,btohqsg
Procrastination and interest are the 2 main obstacles tbh,btohqsg
Ya lor thats why need to set goals,btohqsg
Looks like too much effort to be fake,btohqsg
Not rly  but ye i do,btohqsg
Just spend some time to know them moreAnd talk more abt myself,btohqsg
What u thinking of ? 0.0,btohqsg
Most students who go tuition arent rly liddat,btohqsg
So i dont think thats a concern,btohqsg
But cfm will have such students,btohqsg
That’s why tuition is just school on easy mode for the teachers,btohqsg
Theres fine tuning done for work given,btohqsg
But workload ofc sch teachers have it harder cos of admin matters,btohqsg
To me not much diff ngl,btohqsg
Its actually the same  just more eyes staring at you,btohqsg
I mean  you have to handle different profiles of students,btohqsg
Some are easier to teach and some are not,btohqsg
I find that fun at times,btohqsg
Some respond to this some respond to that,btohqsg
It is part of the fun,btohqsg
"Thats why u introduce the ""one for all  all for one"" rule",btohqsg
I nearly made the class do something stupid cos of 1 uncooperative person,btohqsg
Yes  except that compromises are made initially,btohqsg
Until it reaches a point whereby its too much,btohqsg
for olevels organic chem is removed right,btohqsg
is it all 4 topics or js the intro to org chem part,btohqsg
According to the press release yes,btohqsg
The rest is supposedly still inside  but to be confirmed,btohqsg
Press release said ‘organic chem’ didn’t specify,btohqsg
I remember back when we were just JC kids,btohqsg
Its sad u see it that way,btohqsg
I was never a jc kid,btohqsg
