I mean calorie mate is a snack,btohqsg
Anyways  what do you do with your stuff after A Levels?,btohqsg
Do you throw them away or keep them?,btohqsg
Wouldn't they already have new stuff from their teachers?,btohqsg
Yeah  they'll get the new stuff then.,btohqsg
Wait  Calorie Mate was only in MGS3 if I recall correctly.,btohqsg
scan them and add to the holy grail google drive,btohqsg
I only have H1 Math stuff.,btohqsg
It's all school papers from the previous years which is already on the holy grail.,btohqsg
I was referring more to notes.If it is school papers  you could either give to a junior since it is printed  or bring to the nearby blue recycling bin for disposal  or give to a garang guni man to dispose it.,btohqsg
We use a lot of papers while teaching or studying  no choice  so try to reduce environmental impact after that where possible  however little.,btohqsg
Give personal stuff  not sch stuff,btohqsg
my trace tgt app abit rabz,btohqsg
like i cant scan my phone on the tap tap thingy,btohqsg
Here in the mall I at,btohqsg
I don't have any  I just do school stuff.,btohqsg
idk is it some new oipdate then got glitch,btohqsg
Thought all phone should have alr,btohqsg
btw tracetogether app doesn’t use nfc,btohqsg
Still doesnt work for mine suddenly,btohqsg
Yup  android is kinda on or off,btohqsg
Feels like doesn't work as well,btohqsg
I WAS STUCK GOING UP AND DOWN THE ENTRANCE,btohqsg
PPARENTLY CUZ MY PHONE AUTO CONNECT TO THE MALL WIFI ALSO,btohqsg
then i try to tap out IT WASNT WORKING,btohqsg
u cant be telling me my bluetooth spoilt right im literally wearing airpods,btohqsg
I placed the token somewhere deep in my bag,btohqsg
All i got to do is squat a little and the thingy will be scanned,btohqsg
no batt until the dust be settling all over it,btohqsg
what yall still doin at this time 😭,btohqsg
plsss post o’s is SO BORING,btohqsg
yes sir i'll go work now,btohqsg
I am self studying F math,btohqsg
Where are u planning to further studies after Os,btohqsg
If is JC i recommend u to get a headstart to prepare. I can tell u what topics to self-study (pm me later the admins here say i want to advertise again),btohqsg
but either way ur ct1 grade can use as toilet paper,btohqsg
It good to have a headstart. So u have more time to understand the hardest topic,btohqsg
And also u must get used to the tediousness of H2 math,btohqsg
I find A math ok ah,btohqsg
For A math is like what,btohqsg
But H2 math Paper 1 was like 20 page long,btohqsg
Sometimes is not about exam...students know how to solve exam qn but doesn't mean they understood the topics.,btohqsg
Bedok gonna fail his ippt lol,btohqsg
