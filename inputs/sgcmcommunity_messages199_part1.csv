Will b unveiled during next year sg motorshow.The new Accord might be introduced also. 2l Hybrid variant,btohqsg
Actually  the 360 VR Cars is just a front and has appeared in newspaper several time including the person name James Tan Heng Khoon. Think have to beware of the person as he can easily use other company names.,btohqsg
What are you on about. Toyota is the most reliable 🔥,btohqsg

Mid-2024 leaderboard: Is it Toyota or BYD that's on top?BYD's spike in popularity shouldn't be surprising - but just how massive has its growth been? Also  where does that leave the traditional heavyweights?➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Toyota or BYD?,btohqsg
Haven't physically tried 3. But there's still room after putting in 2.,btohqsg
My point is that its reliable if taken care of via svc. Less prone to problem coz lesser tech or using older matured tech. Ie their cars using analog meters and some first batches of cars have no blindspot monitoring lane keep assist etc...,btohqsg
Last time I drive Toyota until no engine oil still can endure another 60000km then I scrap,btohqsg
As long as oil change is done.. tbh nothing to fuss about for toyotas,btohqsg
I Never change oil or top up. Anyway scrapyard flooded with Toyota parts,btohqsg
Hahahs this is rich man want find reason to change car,btohqsg
My inlaw driving rav4 also needa pay quite abit for svc at BM. So just saying from experience. No offence to toyota lovers,btohqsg
low maintenence doesn't equal to no maintenence,btohqsg
I think u all don’t get it. If Toyota n other brands don’t do maintenance  which can last longer n by how much?,btohqsg
So u buy toyota to not do maintenance? Is that what u r saying?,btohqsg
U answer my question n u will know,btohqsg
Last time when I still hv Toyota The scrap yard owner every week msg me need Toyota parts or not,btohqsg
Tbh i have no idea as the ppl i noe and myself usually do svc so cant really ans ur questions. Just discussing things as it is. No offense to any fans of toyota,btohqsg

Why many good car workshops don’t expand to also become car dealers?,btohqsg
A friend of mine is looking at COE Altis or Parf Altis. Which one to suggest? Is COE falling soon?,btohqsg
Fully agreed  toyota is tank.. comparing apple to apple (following servicing for a Toyota and non toyota  chances of spending less for repair is on that toyota),btohqsg
I checked one toyota altis before  dipstick empty  poured 3L of EO into engine.. and it was running fine before i check and top up EO.. tok gong..,btohqsg
Drove Toyota before. Can go 1yr+ without servicing. Even when servicing  maintenance and parts dirt cheap. Drive Merc now. If I don't change oil on time I must empty wallet. Sometimes change oil on time still need to empty wallet anyway just because.,btohqsg
Hi guys. Do yall ceramic coat your vehicle?Usually they say free warranty 3 years etc. does this provide assurance to those who usually say coating only last for months?Where do yall send to?,btohqsg
