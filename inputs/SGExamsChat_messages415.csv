my parents are kind of the opposite?,btohqsg
they don't like to talk much about us because they don't like the comparison,btohqsg
they don't even tell people I'm doing a PhD until they start asking why I'm still studying at 25,btohqsg
"My parents don't do that or maybe it's coz I didn't enter a major that they don't like  but my mum used to say ""so and so is in st nic"" etc etc",btohqsg
and you know many of them are asking that because they think I'm taking extra years for my bachelors or smth,btohqsg
not that there's anything wrong with that but the condescension,btohqsg
I'm meeting my gf's extended family next CNY and,btohqsg
from what I hear  they like to brag about the cousin that makes a lot of money,btohqsg
EH TT TIME I GO MY BF HSE CUZ THEY WANTED GIVE ME FOOD,btohqsg
Let them brag  just sit one side enjoy the booze,btohqsg
he works in some finance thing,btohqsg
They will say no phD nevermind but got big money,btohqsg

They usually get the brunt of it from extended relatives,btohqsg
As long as loyal can alr,btohqsg
Idk my parents have big expectation for guys too,btohqsg
I mean I would say neither my girlfriend nor I are conventionally good looking by society's standards,btohqsg
Den ur parents leh  like do they think of education whatsoever,btohqsg
I think my family is very open minded,btohqsg
Gl to whoever boy that comes my way,btohqsg
My mum thinks my girlfriend is brought up better than me LOL,btohqsg
If you don't respect me as a human being then you don't deserve my respect  in fact I won't even see you as a fellow human,btohqsg
Different parents got different levels of tolerance,btohqsg
I think the bottomline is don't be rude,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ bro said single in 1000000000001 idk languages,btohqsg
If they ask me abt education   I say Idh a phd but a PhD person taught me,btohqsg

Iw to get a bto bfr 35 why's this,btohqsg
One of them is ur overnight shifts,btohqsg
Cos no ones looking for a gf/bf yet,btohqsg

Workout and have manners and you good bro,btohqsg

there are a ton of completely unreplied messages between me and my gf,btohqsg

Because you never know if you can trust them not to take advantage into your home since it happens at doorsteps most frequently,btohqsg
"i mean when me n my ex dating he finish outfield he misses me but i am just like ""oh welcomeback""",btohqsg
Yes  and like I said  a decent person would respect those boundaries and understand your reasons,btohqsg
but ok la i make up by going over with food accompany him,btohqsg

Unless like they‚Äôre good friends who know where you live  but even then  don‚Äôt follow me to my doorstep for at least the first ten dates please.,btohqsg

me n my 8 years fs got times we dont talk for months,btohqsg
Last time halo got CTF modeI used to be v good at capturing red flags for some reason,btohqsg
not all things r 1 perspective,btohqsg
Something happened  go over immediately and figure out what she left unspoken,btohqsg
omg we love open mindedness slay,btohqsg
when u find a rs you should be looking at traits u dont want in the person,btohqsg
It depends if that‚Äôs just them with everyone or just to you,btohqsg
so if youre saying its a fs how wouldnt you consider that thats what theyre gonna do in a rs,btohqsg
