If I recall most will earmark in the same day  and at most few days later.,btohqsg
I recall only 1 or 2 managed to earmark like few days later. But not like 2 weeks later kind,btohqsg
Got it  Okiee will monitor today and see if it is done. Else I reach out to them again :),btohqsg
Yeah must see the situation since we don‚Äôt know the full details like timing and amounts.But so far if done cleanly and timely with some buffer  I think Uob earmark process is quite well done.,btohqsg
Go to your PayLah app. Click the Rewards tab at the bottom of the app to see your list of 'Enrolled Promotions'. Look out for this promo. If u successfully enrolled  it would be in your list of 'Enrolled Promotions'.,btohqsg
Safest is if you didn't withdraw any amounts from Jul to Aug. But if you did then best to check again.,btohqsg
Would transaction at NTUC FairPrice today (30 Aug) be posted by (31 Aug)?,btohqsg
Most likely not. Fairprice transaction usually posts after 2 days.,btohqsg
The posting date after our spending is a gamble of cards. I have experienced anything from transaction posted on the same day (like what u mentioned) to 14 days (5 days car rental fees charged on the first day of the rental).,btohqsg
Engaging the advice of experts here  in preparing for these potential promos:- UOB One earmar- HSBC EGA for SepOne should be emptying the accounts by EOD tmr in preparation?However  with the 30 days clause  then it'll be better to  empty today  30 Aug?,btohqsg
From my understanding  tomorrow is still working day so we can do it tomorrow before the end of tracking time for each bank.,btohqsg
For such cases where 1st September is a Sunday  I would move all the liquid cash into a neutral bonus interest qualifying account like scb esaver (make sure the July benchmark adb is $1) whose bonus interest period is August and September.Then only start moving into the target HSBC EGA on a weekday.,btohqsg
Hi guys is it possible to get both heymax's miles and shopback's cashback from the same purchase?,btohqsg
So like Anthony  you'd move tomorrow before cut off from the accounts  is that correct?,btohqsg
My experience same as Jasmine when I use FairPrice app to pay for FairPrice and Kopitiam groceries and food respectively. To add  I found that using physical card  (contactless) increase the chance of getting transaction posted 2 business days after spent,btohqsg

Hi All  for uob one account  the $500 credit card spend in UOB one cc  does it count insurance payment and utility bill (sp group)?,btohqsg
For Card  Insurance no  SP yesFor Account  both yes,btohqsg
If cancel credit card. Will it affect credit score?,btohqsg
Generally no. Unless the card is cancelled due to credit related reasons (such as lapse in payment and perpetual late payment),btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know what‚Äôs the cheapest way to meet the investment requirement for DBS multiplier account? Hopefully risk free also üò¨,btohqsg
Can u help us understand what u mean by risk free in the context of investment pls?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs more like a hope  understand that investment is never risk free. I just want to meet the requirement for higher interest üò¨üò¨,btohqsg
I see.. There is a UT that cover MMF and Sovereign bond. Can't remember its name,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if HSBC EGA will extend their bonus interest promo for Sep?,btohqsg
From my view point  it is not worth to put in the effort to get the interest for DBS multiplier account. Other bank account interest rate requirement is much easier to attain. I given up on DBS.,btohqsg
hello  does anyone know if i use UOB visa under apple pay for shopback purchases  is that considered contactless?,btohqsg
In-app apple pay is considered online.,btohqsg
hi guys  i tried looking up in this chat but cant find the infodoes anyone know for singsaver shopee voucher welcome gift (say S$300)  how is it issued and what's the expiry date?,btohqsg
Yup. Gonna abandon wwmc during this period.,btohqsg
SG doesn't really have credit score per ce. So as long as u pay all on time  u r good,btohqsg
Correct! FIs in Singapore look into our Credit Report before granting loans and approving credit cardshttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/why-credit-report-is-important.html,btohqsg
Does Cardup qualify for credit card spend for OCBC360 additional interest?,btohqsg
Hi  sorry if this is a basic qn. If I have a uob ladys card with bonus category of dining  and I spend 5k paying for insurance (not bonus category)  after which I spend 1k on food  will I still get the 4 mpd for the 1k spend on food?Thanks!,btohqsg
Like to check Is it worth it to use cardup paired with DBS Altitude to pay my prudential insurance  income and property tax  mcst? Thanks.,btohqsg
If I move all my funds from UOB One account  there is a fall below charge if under $2000 MAB. If the account got $0  will that still be charged?I‚Äôm thinking to zero the account. Anybody got experience with this?Also I checked and now UOB allows daily transfer limit of up to $200k so if you‚Äôre maxing $150k  it can be done in a day.,btohqsg
Got dp you get negative balance üòÖ,btohqsg
Due to the transfer limit  if start the transfer from scb e-saver to hsbc ega on Sunday 01Sept (etc $200k) and Mon 02Sept (etc $160K)Then it will reflect $360K in HsBc EGa on 02Sept and at the same time i will still earn the interest on esaver till 01Sept correct?,btohqsg
If I didn‚Äôt recall wrongly  SCB and HSBC don‚Äôt record transactions on Sundays. They will be posted on Monday instead and accounted from there.,btohqsg
Hello Chris  there‚Äôs no IOS apps ver for this Long Bridge?,btohqsg
i signed up but cannot get otp sms to set the trade pwd in order to deposit‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes i understand that. So means i can get total of $360K into hsbc ega earlier on 02Sept if i start on 01Sept (which will not be posted)   comparing if i only do it on 02Sept  i will need another day on 03Sept due to the transfer limits  as transfer limit is by day regardless of weekend ?,btohqsg
Then the 2k transfer in + 5x transactions do on 2 Sep (Mon) for EGA ? Or 1 Sep (Sun) or doesn't matter ?,btohqsg
Just curious  You registered the promo for aug -sep or you waiting to register new promo for sep-oct?,btohqsg
Nice. I'm doing that as well. Hope the rates won't drop too much.,btohqsg
Yes your understanding is correct because SCB/HSBC won't debit/credit on Sundays.,btohqsg
UOB One has minimum balance requirement of $1000 ADB.Just keep $1000 inside at all times to be safe  even when waiting for next promo.,btohqsg
