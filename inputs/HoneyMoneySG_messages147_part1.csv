"Hi  may I ask which is the best ""no exclusions"" cashback card in singapore to get cashback on things like membership  organisations (MCC 8699) education and things the standard cards wont get cashback for",btohqsg
It’s better than the UOB Amex right? I see some ppl recommending that too,btohqsg
Amex true cashback has much lesser exclusions than Uob Amex absolute,btohqsg
does anyone know how to redeem uob one card cashback?,btohqsg
thank you! is there a way to see how much rebate ive gotten?,btohqsg
When you get it  you'll know. Unless you tracked it yourself using Excel.,btohqsg
Have to call in. I was in your position before.,btohqsg
I noticed a lot of times users just spam the same question to KLI and honey money forum. Let’s ask the right question in the appropriate forum.,btohqsg
Hello sifus. I newbie to funds.Like to ask for your advise on ntuc income Asia dynamic return fund (by Fullerton):https://www.income.com.sg/kcassets/fd7f3944-82b5-483b-b7b5-fc81dfef23c7/Asia%20Dynamic%20Return%20Fund_v1_Fullerton.pdfIs this fund stable/safe?The advisor introduced me  and inform that 4% yield hmmmThanks,btohqsg
Don't need to see. All ilps is bad.,btohqsg
I supposed that the advisor didn’t tell you the capital is not protected and the returns will vary.,btohqsg
Hi In this scenario:- reached BHS in MA- reached FRS in SAThere is no way to do cash top up for tax relief.Can one still get tax relief by contributing to SRS in the above scenario?,btohqsg
Yes. Provided not 80k tax relief cap,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  I though amaze will still deduct from Citi reward. Ok with check the T n C from singsaver,btohqsg
SRS is separate from CPF. But still limited by annual tax relief cap of $80k as stated by@jj000111.If you're new to SRS  please take some time to research before contributing.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice!Was a little confused if SRS could still give tax relief with full FRS and full BHS.One more question: with full BHS  the “extra” funds go into SA and both MA and SA still earn the interest.When SA reaches FRS  the “extra”funds go into OA.- MA earn 4% interest- SA earn 4% interest- OA earn 2.5% interestAm I understanding it right? 🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
i think its Kevin Learns Investing,btohqsg
Sorry. Shouldn’t assume all know. Imagine someone answer in this forum while it was already answered in the other forum. It is about respecting each other time especially you are the one asking for help. I could be too particular 😶,btohqsg
Dont worry. I am seeing those spamming questions all the time  up to 3-4 different groups 😂And even worse  spammed then never replied when ppl asked for more details.,btohqsg
Some even answered in several videos lo lol,btohqsg
You can check uob internet banking. It will show up under the credit card. There is a dedicated section which shows the cashback awarded,btohqsg
Maybe not read the reply because not in thread  so not mentioned to the Op,btohqsg
#dptrying to top up suica with dbs alt to make use of their 5mpd promo but was declined. Called up DBS and they said mobile suica is among high risk merchants so it was blocked. They will unblock for 24h but with the risk of no charge back for this period.,btohqsg
When you reach FRS and BHS  contributions and interest earned from your MA will flow to your OA.Contributions and interest on your SA will remain in your SA.,btohqsg

Thanks Anthony. Went I go to Lazada to purchase nutc fair price vouncher . They charge more expensive than the original price of the voucher. Is it normal?,btohqsg
Or make some effort to search the chat or for the videos by the creators first?,btohqsg
The seller can set any price he/she wants to sell at.It may be better for you to buy from ntuc directly to avoid getting scammed and have frustration/trouble/heartache,btohqsg
Better to buy off the counter,btohqsg
Normal as platform charge seller fee,btohqsg
Can we do RSP for Nikko am sti using SRS funds in poems please,btohqsg
