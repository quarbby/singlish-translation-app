the phrasing alone is annoying me,btohqsg
Person A: $30Person B: $0Person A: $12Person B : $18Person A: $52Person B: -$22?,btohqsg
Am I doing something wrong here,btohqsg
Congrats  you solved it 👏Person A profits $22,btohqsg
Person C : i have no money,btohqsg
У меня тоже нет денег! (Literally I also have no money ) 😂😂,btohqsg
needs more seafood. abit too watery imho.,btohqsg
Well I bought a levels math books and had to consider budget first 😅😅,btohqsg
where's your relative in between the 20 to 50 range?,btohqsg
ohhh. normal then. Unless your family reunion dinner was on last weekend.,btohqsg
then most of the people should technically make it.,btohqsg
I realise that can use a level Mathematics book to grind for Poly stats module uh   for those in Poly or contemplating Poly education   I gave you all a great hint on how to study for stats in certain cases,btohqsg
😂 what you study in Poly for your diploma? and What degree you aim in Uni?,btohqsg
Business stats in Poly under IT course,btohqsg
tbh  most of the Maths you learnt won't be reused.And typically Diploma Maths are really watered down lol,btohqsg
You planning to transition back to Computer Science in your Degree?,btohqsg
I study Probability   conditional Probability   Bnomial Distribution  Poisson  normal distribution and T,btohqsg
This would be easier if you just get a Free Cambridge International A-Level Mathematics 9709 Syllabus textbook lol.,btohqsg
Almost the same as a levels just with slightly reduced difficulties,btohqsg
pretty sure you can Google the eBook online.,btohqsg
"but it won't be written for ""Business"" examples.",btohqsg
Those going Poly   check your syllabus if similar to A levels stats syllabus  if yes   can grind already on A level books,btohqsg
I meant for the International Syllabus  since Physical Textbooks are bloody expensive lol,btohqsg
Well I imply if you can pass a level stats   definitely positive you can deal with Poly Business Stats or Biostatistics,btohqsg
ahh not sure do you really need it in your future work/degree.to me kinda like meh.I haven't seen a Bell curve Distribution graph for some time now.,btohqsg
Computer science I think need 🤔,btohqsg
My Poly GPA quite low so anything I would need job experience to make up for it to enter uni,btohqsg
The last time I saw it was my Graduate Trainee internship in Intel. Doing Testchip picking  where the fab screen through hundreds of chips.Sent use a sample of the batch.I just need to plot the data into a Bellcurve.,btohqsg
Then fab screen through the chip  the max frequency it can goes up to. *Then we just reclassify the chips for further functionality testing like is this a test chip performing below  nornmal  above speeds.,btohqsg
So you used it for chip engineering nice ...,btohqsg
"not really detailed stuff. but you kinda get the idea  if you want to classify your Chips speed by how many ""sigma"" standard deviations.",btohqsg
why say 2 $20 ? should just say $40 lol,btohqsg
Enjoy the cheap food and 🤣,btohqsg
Wait you intend to bring study materials?,btohqsg
I think you guys will be soon when I'm starting school soon 🤣,btohqsg
While I cried in tears 😮‍💨,btohqsg
BTW I think jc start school already right?,btohqsg
Ahh miss sec school days 😂😂,btohqsg
idr much of sec sch atp,btohqsg
But idk what you went through so,btohqsg
Can't comment  my sch back then lots of toxic ppl but at least my teacher isn't toxic,btohqsg
"Certain subjects in school never have ""gd friends""🤣",btohqsg
Yup graduated from Poly some time ago,btohqsg
