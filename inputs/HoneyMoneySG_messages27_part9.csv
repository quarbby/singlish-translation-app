mainly for oversea spending still can use mah,btohqsg
If use amaze den only 1.2 as charged in sgd,btohqsg
you will get FCY fess etc,btohqsg
not worth the extra 0.6 mpd i feel,btohqsg
I just received my cpm new card never noticed was visa or master. Later I check,btohqsg
It's 1.2 miles + 1% cashback from instarem for foreign currency spend dont forget,btohqsg
yeah exacty you paying so much for all the foreign currecy fee and bank shit spread for 2mpd really bo hua,btohqsg
But usually those is 3 payments. The 24mths instalment is tempting  just can't seem to find info on which card can be used for 4mpd using it.,btohqsg
24 months ones usually is either merchant side (no rewards) or bank side (Rewards with small fee),btohqsg
Looks like Bo Bian have to use amaze for 1.4mpd.. unless link to ocbc tiantitum? Overseas spend got extra perks? Overseas shopping at stores,btohqsg
Amaze really have so much problems?,btohqsg
Depends how you use bah  I put some recurring charges (like gym membership) on that so if i max my CRMC  can remotely switch card to my CitiPM,btohqsg
Is the Amex true cash back to grabpay idea still feasible?,btohqsg
Only if you're a low spender and you use Grab services often or make GrabPay online transactions often (e.g. FavePay/Shopback),btohqsg
Understood!The idea is that my company does pay for our grab trips.So I guess I can claim abit as well.Next is if I have a big ticket items. Which method should I go for?,btohqsg
There are better cashback cards for higher spenders lik UOB One/UOB Evol. But if you can't spend $400 per month then Amex TCB + GrabPay is a good choice,btohqsg
Ty so much i guess thatâ€™s the best,btohqsg
Close runner ups are Citi Rewards (2.27% cashback or 2.7-3% shopping vouchers) or HSBC Revolution (2.5% cashback). For cashback on big ticket purchases  first thing that comes to my mind is Citi SMRT and HSBC Advance,btohqsg
Wow shiok use cimb card on ShopBack voucher $5 five times and get 5 times 100 percent cashback,btohqsg
Just use yr cimb card on shop back apps and buy the Watson voucher $5 and get 100 percent cashback. Can do it 5 times,btohqsg
Before that link yr cimb card to ShopBack first,btohqsg

Hi! I just got my uob one cc approved. Haven't got my physical card yet. Want to ask if Jan is gonna be my first month of the quarter and I need to hit $500 by end of Jan otherwise next 2 months no cashback?,btohqsg
u can check with the chat assist bot  otherwise in the TnC they do speak abt the first 3 months for qualifying,btohqsg
Will be prorated for the next 2 months. If you fail to hit the min spend in Jan and you hit 500 for Feb and Mar  you get $33 instead of $50,btohqsg
"can I also ask  to hit the min card spend to qualify for interest for the uob one account  there's no restrictions right?website says ""All Visa and/or MastercardÂ® transactions successfully posted in the calendar month"". Things like paying for utility bills and topping up ewallet also counted?",btohqsg

Hi everyone. Now that grab no longer accepts axs payment  is there an alternative for payment of taxes and cc bills?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGyou mentioned getting the sc visa infinite to increase 360 rewards pts redemption for miles.. but the card comes with a strictly non-waivable $594 annual fee tho  how is that ever worth it ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
U mean u have cash? Or people transferring u? Unless u plan to hold usd then can hear his suggestion to fd usd. Or open a ibkr trading account and convert usd to sgd. Comm is fx rates.,btohqsg
Then I not very sure. See where allow deposit usd into multi currency. But I think shld have some charges involved,btohqsg
