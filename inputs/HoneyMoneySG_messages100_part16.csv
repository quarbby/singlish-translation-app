I like Youtrip now only for one reason:Can withdraw JPY44 400 cash per month TOTALLY FREE at 7/11 in Japan.,btohqsg
Lol  i go japan think 80-90 percent can use card. Nobody stopping one from holding multiple card ah. Can have both for different purpose,btohqsg
Usually ppl use amaze link citireward,btohqsg
Like i bring mulitple card for my trip  max out amaze plus citireward then move to ocbc frank  then uob vs or uob ppv or uob evol  amaze can link to uob lady if u have bonus cat for travel purpose like i pay for hotel when i arrive etc  or dining if the country take card for restaurant. Card acceptance highly depend on the country u are traveling to. So need to indicate where u are traveling to,btohqsg
Max out meaning? Thereâ€™s a cap to the points awarded on Citi?,btohqsg
Cap at 1k for bonus point of 4mpd. But i have 2 player for citirewards so mean i can spend 2k,btohqsg
10x points capped for $1k eligible spend in statement month,btohqsg
Yup  i think really need to use card..,btohqsg
If u know how to play the card game can accumulate miles very fast,btohqsg
Can share tips? I find keeping up with the changes to the card benefits very confusing ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The tips is to need constant keep up lol  bank keep changing,btohqsg
Can't split booking  Air Canada so can't use Krisflyer card,btohqsg
Then dbs wwmc is your best shot i think  cap at 1.5k spending,btohqsg
Which one u use for miles?,btohqsg
Nowadays is amaze plus citirewards  then lady then uob ppv,btohqsg
I think its hard to judge it can be different for different country,btohqsg
For travel that i forsee will use more then 1k foreign currency i will be uob vs,btohqsg
Yea thanks! Although idk if I will keep using it as I usually just use citi rewards with amaze for other spend  scared the points will just be there haha,btohqsg
Hi May i know for certain credit card which required min income like cimb visa infinite  if my NOA for year 2022 is  lower than min 120k   but years 2023 NOA is higher than 120k  will it get approved? because when i apply it trigger 2 years of NOA result,btohqsg
Currently UOB One  Citi rewards  UOB Ladys  Trust cc,btohqsg
Maybe uob lady if u are after miles  uob one if u can fulfil 2k each month for your quarter,btohqsg
Yea good point maybe for welcome gift sometimes then change,btohqsg
I cancelled my uob one credit card after realize need one whole quarter to fulfill before get cashback,btohqsg
Well clause 5.9 is there. Can try but no guarantees if it works,btohqsg
haha but i can't hit enough spending on one category,btohqsg
Haha I submitted anyway see how,btohqsg
2.5k on airticket can be clock on uob lady if it is travel cat since u dont have solitaire,btohqsg
Those cards that you hold give max $1k rewards.If you have UOB Krisflyer   can buy via OTAs that eligible for 3mpd if you have $800 spend on SQ related.If UOBKF is not suitable for you  have you explore buying 1 way ticket in near month end of month A and return flight in early part of 2nd month? Compare how much difference if using this method against buying full return ticket.,btohqsg
