Same place i found a Aston martin,btohqsg

Pics I took of Neo Tiew Rd quite some time back,btohqsg
I like how it looks like a road u will see a panda 86 drifting on it in the morning lol,btohqsg
Very fun road almost crashed and died once 8/10 üëç,btohqsg
This was recorded by me 9 years ago,btohqsg
Direction is northbound from Neo Tiew estate to the Kranji Reservoir,btohqsg
Neo tiew estate itself. You cannot go in now to take pics like this because it's now fenced up,btohqsg
But yes it is really spooky creepy üëª,btohqsg
Once upon a time  people lived here  worked here  kids played in the playground,btohqsg
The playground especially was fucking creepy at night,btohqsg
Like COD Modern Warfare the Pripyat mission,btohqsg
I once nearly crashed and died at Devils bend at the old Upper Thomson Road,btohqsg
There is a very good reason Old Upper Thomson Rd is now closed at night from 7pm to 7am,btohqsg
The Devil's bend killed 2 poly students in their Mitsubishi Lancer many many years ago,btohqsg

iron sight is abouve the scope,btohqsg
Aka the SG version of M16A1,btohqsg

SAF GPMG is so classic and old  but it just works,btohqsg
Last time back in 2017  one guy came to ICT in this,btohqsg
I checked the plates  it's still running around and registered,btohqsg
Based on road tax payable  it should be having the 1JZ-GTE in there,btohqsg
280ps  same engine as the Supra MK3 JZA70,btohqsg
i have a photo of it somewhere,btohqsg
The one I have is a 2 digit plate,btohqsg
Rims look the same  just different center caps on them,btohqsg

Those were the days when Toyota made one nice engine and put it in 101 models because why not,btohqsg
Go Japan  buy a half-cut Chaser with 1JZ-GTE. Swap it in a old Cressida and trash a Ford Falcon at the drag strip with it lol,btohqsg
