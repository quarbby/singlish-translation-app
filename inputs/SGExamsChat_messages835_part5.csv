Is Red Alpha Cybersecurity worth it to get some industry training?,btohqsg
It's run by some of the more prominent cybersecurity peeps in SG. But I wouldn't recommend if you are just starting out in cybersecurity  only if you already have some experience and want to dive further,btohqsg
Would it be good as a pseudo-honors/internship after a private university cybersec degree?,btohqsg
You honestly would need to look into the qualifications they provide you  and see if it adds value to your current set of skills. I've had a friend who graduated from a private uni and working full-time now in one of the Big 4 (with no other certification),btohqsg
I would say if you are still pursuing your degree  go for your internship first. If you like the company  see if you can talk to your supervisor or manager to see if you could transition to a full-time role when you graduate. Check the salary  employment benefits too before accepting the offer,btohqsg
Tl;Dr See if the training programmes Red Alpha gives you  would really benefit you,btohqsg
