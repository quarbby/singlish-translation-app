im so mad i got that almlst right,btohqsg
it's because you don't see the hard work behind,btohqsg
I know of 2 self made multi millionaires. They are quite slack and enjoying life now.But I know they worked real hard in their younger days,btohqsg
one of them retired at age 35.,btohqsg
not the literal blood sweat and tears,btohqsg
it's really about putting in the work,btohqsg
blood sweat and tears by bts,btohqsg
some get lucky and reach the goal faster,btohqsg
if academic route cannot  im gonna audit to be an idol in sk,btohqsg
Can slack and earn? Can. Born into rich family,btohqsg
can earn money and brand deals,btohqsg
as long as high salary can alr,btohqsg
no more maths and chem anymore ehhh,btohqsg
I feel like the only way to earn millions is either to deceive  cheat or scam people,btohqsg
You can never be a honest person if you want to be a millionaire,btohqsg
wait when ur passion is unable to sustain urself then u question,btohqsg
so ur relatives are all scammers,btohqsg
Nope I’m just saying  I mean theoretically advertisements are scamming…They advertise a product but the product in question does not appear the same way,btohqsg
don’t everyone has had that phrase,btohqsg
Is that not some form of scamming?,btohqsg
i think my friend went to apply for the nyc flim sch,btohqsg
im planming to audit ar hybe or sm,btohqsg
do you honestly think it’s also that easy,btohqsg
I could care less honestly…not like you can scam someone into buying a miracle pill,btohqsg
A million isn't a lot nowadays. You don't see it yet because you are still young,btohqsg
i think i need to find a billionaire or millionaire man to marry next time,btohqsg
That’s why I’m thinking if I’m sheltered,btohqsg
nth is easy in life if u don't work for it:),btohqsg
I worked 70h a week that time,btohqsg
Whatever the definition  I just think it’s someone with millions,btohqsg
a millionaire quite literally means having assets worth up to a million,btohqsg
student loans really dragged me down a lot,btohqsg
im literally just stating what I’ve seen in my life,btohqsg
There is no argument  I just want some thoughts on it. That is literally it,btohqsg
someone who is worth a million or more based on assets+money,btohqsg
I’m not purposely being dumb or retarded…I feel like I’ve just been too sheltered,btohqsg
is been almost 20years  my parents still haven't finish paying off our hse,btohqsg
imagine my loan is 1.5%but fixed d at 3%,btohqsg
but kpop idol might be to far if udh talent,btohqsg

a lot of these look nice on the surface,btohqsg
keep thinking that way i guess,btohqsg
My thinking have made me money lmao,btohqsg
I want to die for this sem,btohqsg
I see it differently. I see it as you need to work hard to learn how to manage the family assets in the future,btohqsg
It not a lot but it’s a start…don’t you all say that,btohqsg
bro manages to be dumber than woke leftists  at least their claim is Billionaires have to be unethical which is slightly more plausible than this idiot talking about multimillionaires,btohqsg
an insider from an ent told me pretty face can solve all this,btohqsg
but i mean u can try,btohqsg
