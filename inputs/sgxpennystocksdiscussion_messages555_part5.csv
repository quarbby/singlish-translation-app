I will press buy buttonI will screen shot to show,btohqsg
It’s true. HSO is likely the best micro Penny in SGX  FA. No doubt. But why the BBs don’t play it. No catalyst.,btohqsg
Okay man. We will be watching for your big buy in to HSO tomorrow bro!,btohqsg
If Sinjia can be this priceHSO really too much undervalued,btohqsg
sinjia 1hw3 hit 50w5 tgt 62px need to punch up w3 50,btohqsg

100k is market value  he blanko d cost 😛,btohqsg
i match in 500 lot support u tmr 😛 may it do a QT,btohqsg
as in i match in HSO,btohqsg
My cost I think should be approx $0.004. Last round spike up to $0.008 i took 1/3 profit. Should have take all then .,btohqsg
Bro  Sinjia too expensiveHSO  I all in,btohqsg
I feel hard to lose in this one. Undervalued Micro with no debts. Every pip $26k feels good when in play,btohqsg

Hey bro  how are you man. Still trading SGX or playing US mainly ?,btohqsg
Heavy debt . But behind got big mountain support them 😂,btohqsg
Last round I first called out HSO here was $0.003/$0.004 .Play undervalued micros need to position and cannot chase.We saw what happened with SY too.,btohqsg
I don’t like SY no FA but HSO true,btohqsg
ya i think that time i huat the blumont then thought ok la micropenny then whack  then tio stuck lolsy  lucky i bought early and zhao,btohqsg
That was before it went to $0.008/$0.009.But anyways  now I reckon BBs waiting to absorb Wong selling. Once Wong no longer selling   easy to run it.,btohqsg
You never ask me before you buy knn,btohqsg
I have not buy yet .. I see see only 😂,btohqsg
Still in play this one. Maybe minor flushing. Can find a good support to collect some perhaps,btohqsg
No worry we park money and let it growsToo cheap,btohqsg

Not trading much  mostly holding mid term blue chips. 🙌🏻Busy with my real estate biz 💪🏻,btohqsg
Back then when Brunei Prince came in they played to about $0.04x I think . Really power.For me  I hope Brunei Prince take control From the Wongs / HK family  then just inject some new business / catalyst then power already,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Update- 19 October 2021✈️🕯Slowing China's Growth as Expected🕯The latest GDP reading from China is less than expected on the backdrop of deleveraging as the government curbs debt growth in the property sector  and the power cuts have caused factories to shut down. Collectively  it took a toll on the economy.GDP had increased by 4.9% for the quarter  less than the expected 5.2%. Both domestic and abroad conditions remain challenging. The domestic recovery has been wobbling and uneven. The curb on property sector debt through a limit on mortgage lending had slowed the pedal on new construction projects as it had declined for the 6th straight month.⏳Triplets of Headwinds🔭Central to this dim outlook is the missing 3 bond payments by China Evergrande as it struggles to stay afloat with a whopping $305 billion debt load. Then came the power cut by the government to conserve energy which hit industrial production. In perspective  industrial production barely increased compared to its August level.The third barrier is the outburst of Covid-19 cases where zero tolerance on the virus results in multiple strict local regulations that further hampered business activity.Pika World expects that the Chinese economy will continue to slow down. The policy challenges will hit the market  and that the high base effects from last year are a hurdle to cross for investors.Nonetheless  Pika World is not too pessimistic about the Chinese economy  given that consumer spending proves resilient. Retail sales were up 4.4%  which beat expectations. Our outlook will be dependent on two broad factors: how the government and central bank work together to combat slowdown and the degree of monetary easing to alleviate short-term weak prospects.💎Bitcoin: Now you can join the Party💎Proshares will be launching the first US ETF on Tuesday (today)  which tracks Bitcoin prices. The new product will provide consumers who are too nervous about buying Bitcoin directly and wishing to add to their stocks and bond portfolio.Essentially  The Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) will invest in futures contracts  which is betting on the future movement of Bitcoin. However  it is essential to note that while the futures track Bitcoin prices very closely  they are not the same as the actual Bitcoin price.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will have the Building Permits for September  which we expect at 1.68M  down from 1.721M in the prior period.Key members of the FOMC continues to speak. We have Daly speaking at 11 pm  and Bowman speaks at 1.15 am. Bostic will be speaking at 2.50 am  and Fed Waller will speak at 3 am.It is 19 October  Tuesday  7.25 am in Singapore and 7.25 pm in New York. As we begin a new trading session  we wish all Pika World friends a profitable week ahead!,btohqsg
