Click the ! hahaha. It has explanation.,btohqsg
i heard of uob one   but which is btr as compared to ocbc 360,btohqsg
uob one account needs 500 credit card spend every month. With your requirement  i have a feeling UOB stash with current deposit promotion will be the best.,btohqsg
can be debit card spend also,btohqsg
Just applied two weeks ago. My credit limit is 0.5x my monthly salary. I just use it more for getting 10% cashback on my cc spending since the limit is so low.,btohqsg

I remember someone here said that use trust cashback is good for overseas usage  but assume that we need to use 3 months with minimum spend  correct?,btohqsg
Zero fcy and 1% cash is good by itself. I'm waiting for more info on how 1% works before getting one myselfm,btohqsg
But can‚Äôt use HSBC ega  which is the same 1% ‚Äúloss‚Äù,btohqsg
If trust support HSBC ega giro  it will be an easy win.,btohqsg

Hi all Anyone knows if you hold 2 citibank cards  the statement of calendar month will be on the same date?,btohqsg
if you apply the same time yes,btohqsg
what you can do is call the bank and request for same billing date   before they send you the card,btohqsg
how long does uob approve the apllication,btohqsg
restart of points will be start of the month,btohqsg
Anybody can enlighten why Mari Invests has $0.00 returns on last Friday and today?,btohqsg
Hi just wanted to ask a simple question. Currently I have paired my citi rewards card with Instarem. And have converting the points from citi rewards to kris flyer miles. Just curious  what will be the best way to convert the citipoints?I feel that normal cashback with rate of 2.27% might not be that great but Krisflyer seems like a good deal so far,btohqsg
yes convert the citi thankyou points to Krisflyer miles like you said. More value per point,btohqsg
Can the sifu's here confirm if the amaze x citi is nerfed? Last updated this month,btohqsg
Is there mmf in long bridge?The 8 buy trades can be for mmf?,btohqsg
Fullerton SGD Cash fund is available.buy trades apply to stock/etf only,btohqsg
Maam dont say that. Any more nerf amaze will go to the groundz,btohqsg
i would cash out all my amaze points by 1st october if anything.. LOL,btohqsg
ya i used to be able to get amaze pts easier. Like from booking flights and hotels in fcy with uob lady. Now all is gonna end soon.,btohqsg
and whether or not they are sustainable as a business if only Citibank  Maybank  and OCBC are left.I had a look at their Remittance rates not attractive too (Wise is better)... so i dunno what's Amaze use case after 1st October already... is there sufficient volume to support the business.Will VC funds dry up then GG?,btohqsg
if anything  i would also closely watch Amaze's FX spread from Interbank Spot Rate to see if they sneakily increase it again from the current 1.8% ish + 0.8% mastercard spread.... to make up for lost volumes..,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone experience bonus UNI$ for lady‚Äôs card not credited yet this month?,btohqsg
Does a supplementary citi smrt card spending count towards principal $500 min spending?,btohqsg
yes.. the most common reason is they changed card numbers (due to fraud or lost),btohqsg
yes. all spending and rewards earned by supp cards always go to main card holder,btohqsg
But there is no change in my card number though,btohqsg
#dpShopback vouchers purchased with Citi SMRT via Apple Pay and the transaction is consideredonline,btohqsg
Have you gotten lady bonus uni $ before?,btohqsg
Yup I do  every start of the month 2 WD will be credited already (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong),btohqsg
But this month I don‚Äôt see it in my transaction even though I‚Äôve spend for my selected category in Aug,btohqsg
If this is the case  check with UOB what is ur current category. I read in another chat one person got their category change without knowing.,btohqsg
"Finally opened my webull app and pleasantly surprised that the 3% special offer had been deposited to my account....HOWEVER as the USDsgd exchange is at an all time low (1.29)  inclusive of daily interest and 3% bonus  I'm still at at a principal loss! (~ -0.39% loss)And this is before converting usd to sgd which will result in commission fee and further negative losses aka lose more capital!Lesson learnt; don't be blinded by the ""generous"" offer  don't rely on a single source for info...It's esp heartbreaking as all my savings (6 figures) is in USD and I may need to redeem and exchange to SGD soon because of personal commitment (wedding housing etc)Sighhhh üò≠üò≠üò≠",btohqsg
Take it as lesson learnt. Fx fluctuation is always a risk.,btohqsg
