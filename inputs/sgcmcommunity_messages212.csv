If buying Opel or Astra new then it's less riskier as the condition of the car is up to you.

If things go south  it will be tougher to source parts and labour knowhow for these brands vs Honda or Toyota.,btohqsg

Hello - i wanted to check.I am in process of buying a 2nd hand Mercedes ev. Fairly young unit still under warranty with c&c.Wanna arrange a pre purchase inspection - any recommendations?,btohqsg
Just for my curiosity  What are you expecting to find? The car seems to be a fairly new EV with warranty remaining.I heard STA is the standard pre-purchase vehicle inspection option that many dealers agree to. I think this should be sufficient for a young EV.,btohqsg
You got check if the warranty follow car or follow owner?,btohqsg
And whether the servicing with c&c was followed thru by previous owner,btohqsg

Still not as expensive as ev road tax,btohqsg
Plus ev no parf or little parf at the end,btohqsg
all these parf and road tax are just one part of the equation. There is no point to analyze them individually. Prudent way is to just arrive at an all inclusive 10 year cost and then compare the pros and cons in terms of drivability features etc. 10 yr cost is fuel cost based on est mileage  road tax  insurance  price of car  estimated repair spare parts cost  repair and maintainrncr cost per year (lower for EV) and finally parf rebate at 10th year etc..,btohqsg
This is because new ev doesn't have arf  so what you dun pay in the beginning  you dun get back in the end,btohqsg
Isn’t that better? Drive to scrap without having to worry scrap value,btohqsg

The more you loan the happier they are,btohqsg
They will mark up the price on paper to secure higher loan,btohqsg
Therefore you monthly will be higher and interest will be more,btohqsg
Can la  just mark up the car price,btohqsg
