do yall know any quick remedies for food poisoning,btohqsg
such that i can at least fall asleep,btohqsg
Erm normally if my fd poisoning is so bad that i couldnt sleep  i jus go 24hr clinic,btohqsg
Another remedy is sleep with the pain after a few times in the toilet,btohqsg
Idk  nvr tried but i dont suggest la cos i took wrong medication and ended upvomiting foam,btohqsg
Idk lol my mom jus gave it to me out of panic but i was sick so didn't and couldn't think too much abt it xD,btohqsg
Usually that med works but i guess that time is a more severe fd poisoning or smthü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...but like you said might be allergy,btohqsg
do u rmb what u took,btohqsg
Yea a tiny yellow polka dot med  from prev  doc visits  for fd poisoning ba,btohqsg
Dun rmb the pill name alr but had to gokk then they gave me some purple fluid(glucose) to ingest then wait for awhile to see if i still vomit..and if i did vomit  which i kinda felt like but didnt after ingesting glucose 2nd time  i had to be hospitalised,btohqsg
Yee but it was years ago. Not that recent anymore haha,btohqsg
What happens to my points if I am from higher Chinese in secondary school means I don't take jc chinese,btohqsg
HCL D7 then don‚Äôt need alr,btohqsg
h1 Chinese is basically just HCL,btohqsg
not bad  A AB AB / AB,btohqsg
looks nicer than AUU / U,btohqsg
Then no bonus points lor. Anyway if you get 90rp if your mtl is A it would be useless since you can‚Äôt possibly increase your rp any further,btohqsg
Take activated charcoal pills. Don‚Äôt go chew on those normal charcoal for cooking hor.Also if too pain  pls go see doc. Get buscopan or similar meds that can help with stomach cramping.Most importantly  stay hydrated. Don‚Äôt be like that stupid sec sch boy who died of diarrhea cos he too lazy to drink water. True story. Sg,btohqsg
Hi guys! With the whole Russia-Ukraine situation  please take note that when speaking to your Russian and Ukrainian friends that WE ARE NOT OUR GOVERNMENT. You're not speaking to Putin or Zelensky  you're speaking to A PERSON YOU KNOW. A lot of Russians have family members in Ukraine  and a lot of Ukrainians have family members in Russia. Nobody wants war  especially not civilians. WE ARE HUMANS.,btohqsg
Real case. Boy in sg died from diarrhea. Think it was 1-2 yrs ago,btohqsg
They're basically telling u  be kind to Russians/Ukrainians because they don't want it any more than we do.,btohqsg
ig the rising tensions kinda   lead to xenophobia against russians/ukrainians,btohqsg
Kinda like how covid made Asians a target for hatecrimes and stuff,btohqsg
Guys does a math have error carried forward??,btohqsg
a maths is for big boys and girls,btohqsg
