OCBC will be more suitable assuming you have S$100K saved in 360. That's an effective 10% cashback  on $500 spend,btohqsg
Anyone check latest home loan interestIs 300k hdb home loan at 3.15% is good interest? Or it is going down even lower now?,btohqsg
Hey guysWhich card do you use for nets payment(vendors which only accept paynow and NETS debit card)I realised even if I pay using UoB One Debit card the transaction doesn‚Äôt count for 500 dollars spending,btohqsg
paynow uen QR can try Grab or Gpay  for small cashback,btohqsg
I assume it‚Äôs commercial bank rate that you‚Äôre quoting  General trend going forward  cheap money is over  loan rates should stay where they are for at least 1-2 years. Why not go for HDB loan?,btohqsg
if don't have 100k still suitableÔºüüòπü•π,btohqsg
Users of Citi PremierMiles  what transactions do you mainly use it for?,btohqsg
Do you think I should apply for DBS Altitude or SCB Smart card?,btohqsg
I spent my UOB one card  to hit 500 min spend. Posted date is 16 nov but i check my UOB account details on 19 nov  it is still not reflected in the details of my one account. When will it be reflected?,btohqsg
No posting on weekend. Wait for few more days.,btohqsg

Hi guys  i am buying SQ tickets (around $4k) but i only have HSBC revolution and citi rewards card now. Should i apply for Krisflyer UOB now or how can I maximize my miles/rewards?Many thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  wanna check if webull or interactive broker is better for options trading?,btohqsg
Yes you should .. UOB KF CC,btohqsg
CRC does not reward for travelling .. just go with UOB KFCC .. its 3MPD anyway,btohqsg
Does using UOB Evol for SP bill count toward minimum spend or not at all?,btohqsg
Does purchase in taobao count as eligible purchase?,btohqsg
Thanks DavidNot sure if i can apply now and get it in 2-3 days?,btohqsg
Customer service said can call to expedite,btohqsg
hmm as in count to min spend for rebate? It is excluded based on TnC,btohqsg
Get based point for travel mcc right just no bonus point?,btohqsg
This is reprice quote from DBS bank  I am paying 4% now . Not eligible to hdb loan ald üòÇ,btohqsg
How many years lock in? What is the interest rate of third year?,btohqsg
was talking about uob evol for sp bills,btohqsg
Oh  can use uob one for sp,btohqsg
4.75%  probably will reprice again after 2 years,btohqsg
When looking at mortgage interest  you need to look at the 3rd year interest too because you cant have free refinance  only have free reprice on third year. However  the bank knows you are still in crawl back periods  the reprice package offered to you during crawl back period 2 years later will be higher than market rate.,btohqsg
Agree  hence the banks‚Äô profits and dividends are safe. Good for shareholders  bad for mortgage holders,btohqsg
Hi is HSBC EGA still a good savings account? It seems to state the minimum requirements is 100k for the bonus rate?,btohqsg
If I used iChange virtual card  do I need to unfreeze physical card too?,btohqsg
Any know about term life policy?,btohqsg
What u need to know abt it,btohqsg
Yes it is. I have received these kind of messages mentioning JobsDB before. They were from foreign phone numbers. But this is still a scam even though it is a Singapore number. You should report the number and also anonymously report it toscamalert.sg,btohqsg
if you did applied for smth similar on jobsdb  its prob legitimate,btohqsg
How I can scam them back and get some income,btohqsg
lmao  i think theyre smarter thn you,btohqsg
Dont do it the money u receive might be from other victim  then your acct will be frozen and go into investigation,btohqsg
Yes this is true and you could possibly be considered as a money mule which is a criminal offence.,btohqsg
Hi all. Just to confirm. If I use the crmc for overseas shopping such as dept store. I dun earn 4 miles rite,btohqsg
If it fall under the mcc for offline shopping u get 4 mpd as well,btohqsg
u do get 4mpd if fall under department store/clothes/bags/shoes mcc regardless local/overseas.Should pair Amaze+crmc  to reduce the fx fees and get 4mpd for any mcc no long not in exclusion,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can pair the amaze card (linked to Citirewards) to Ali pay to earn 4mpd for spending in China,btohqsg
Firstly  check ACRA  there is no such company registered in Singapore.If have  check are the email address n tel number are legitimate.,btohqsg
Woo cos i have investments across multiple apps (tiger  ibkr  moomoo) wanted to collate in a single view,btohqsg
