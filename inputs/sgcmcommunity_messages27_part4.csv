the main thing with germans is the aircon modes,btohqsg
must set airflow to strong in the settings,btohqsg
? That's a proper electric car charger,btohqsg

But when go full trip can charge full,btohqsg
Standard battery like model3 and other brand can charge to 100%,btohqsg
yeah  some people charge to full and don't realise they're degrading their battery faster,btohqsg
must charge to 80 to 90% at max for optimum efficiency,btohqsg
Yes this is only for nca,btohqsg
and run down to as low as they can as it charges faster from a low percentage,btohqsg
tesla has nailed one thing and that's integrating the native supercharger network with nav and estimating range and charge level to pre heat and cool the battery accordingly for optimum charging,btohqsg
