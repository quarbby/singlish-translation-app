Using any card and gets 17.5% discount on my SingTel bill?,btohqsg
U already ask yuu card liao suddenly any card?,btohqsg
Not a suggestion.Maybe go learn from some trading courses. Then work part time or what to have more money to trade to test whether to see if u have the talent in trading. Maybe 1 out of 100 people maybe have. But have to burn your trading account many times. Of course if you super talented maybe can make a lot.Or you shld just concentrate on your studies more.Your money won't grow much either. For investing so shldnt put in too much effort. As investing is about % gain over a extended period of times.$1000  20% per annual even you super good value investor. For 5 years is just $2500 end of 5 years. So you see the effort is not really worth your time.Anyway just my 2 cent.The first part I mention is what I did in the past.,btohqsg
wow u are the 1 in 100 la MAKE BIG MONEY!,btohqsg
Anyway it your own life. You must find out yourself what you good at.,btohqsg
No lah. Normal only. If you can make money in stocks naturally already in the 10%. Most ppl lose money actually. üòÇ So actually I am just average only.,btohqsg
Hello Gurus! Can I pair Citi Rewards card with Atome to earn 4 mpd for the three months provided I make the payment myself instead of waiting for the auto deduction?,btohqsg
Hi any advice for CPF OA money to earn higher interest?,btohqsg
Is it worth purchasing air tickets with Trust card or citi premiermiles card?,btohqsg
If you have yet hit 40k combined balances in SA & MA  you can transfer to SA first. Especially if you have no use for OA yet (not buying house anytime soon).,btohqsg
Hi anyone has experienced with Maybank for not receiving credit card billing for more than 1 month. My last statement was 25 Aug till today still has not received any new bill. Check online also dun have. Is this normal?,btohqsg
Hi Friends  may i know how long the Maybank F&F card takes to approve? have an incoming big purhcase and will need to time it,btohqsg
hi guys  would like to seek advice on what's a good miles card to use for a big purchase (~10k)? TIA,btohqsg
Comparing ocbc 360  dbs live fresh  and uob one credit card for cashback  any inputs? Gonna be paying for renov and getting big items at like courts and shopee and TB,btohqsg
Not sure how Maybank fnf can use for big purchases.It‚Äôs capped at $312.50 per category.,btohqsg
More for the new signup bonus cause the purchase won‚Äôt get much miles nor cash back under my current cards,btohqsg
Even if approved  Maybank usually inform application status via snail mail instead of on app  so need a while.I applied 2 months ago and it took about 1.5 weeks +  maybe 11 days to be exact for card to come to me  ymmv haha,btohqsg
Haha np  on the flip side  the NTB reward come v fast. Once u rch the spend alrd  the reward redemption notice comes v fast (if you apply through bank)  abt 1 weekend for me,btohqsg
Seeing all the luggage‚Äôs being listed for sale for months on Carousell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leaning towards the  cash back instead,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone apply for hsbc live + in july and opt for $300 evoucher?Would like to check if anyone receive the email for redemption?During the selection time  are we asked to pick which vendor voucher to opt for?Thanks all,btohqsg
Just saying no is not really constructive. I'd love to hear the reason,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt received the 300 e voucher but saw that the $100 cash back from HSBC credited,btohqsg
1}May i know if i use the Maybank F&F spend in Jb   its all categories also getting 8% cashback or just my selected category? And also included the minimum spend?2) if i paired with amaze also consider with cashback and minimum spend?3) if i use the Maybank F&F pay the cardup also consider minimum spend? The cashback under with categories?,btohqsg
Hi for yuu card  is it only worth if we have to clock 600 on it? I thought it might come in handy for occasional purchase at their merchant.I didn't know must hit 600 for it to make sense.,btohqsg
Or any other cc that is good for cashback for the mentioned purpose. Anyone can advise?,btohqsg
Has anyone received from Singsaver cashback vs miles rewards yet?,btohqsg
Transferring from OA to SA is a one way trip. Yes  you don't need to buy house now.. But when you need to buy house..,btohqsg
I am also of the view that shouldn't transfer OA to SA if you are yet to buy a house.One should only transfer from OA to SA if they are either approaching 55. Or they already got a house and very very sure they will not upgrade.Of course risk free rate of 4% sounds good but this is a irreversible transaction.Any excess OA   I would recommend CPFIS-OA or T-Bill / SSB if yield above 2.5%. Alternatively  can also consider robo advisor such as endowuz for CPF OA investment . Invest your OA within the OA space as you can still liquidate your investment in the OA account if there is liquidity need for housing payment.,btohqsg
I have a differing view. You need every OA you need for housing even if you not buying house anytime soon. 4% SA returns not hard to beat if one invest their OA via CPFIS / Robo Advisor.One may think they don't need to buy a house. People mindset change occasionally and if you transferred your OA to SA/MA  irreversible if you suddenly need it for housing.,btohqsg
Then use cash lah. It is the same. I will say just ways of managing money. Ultimately see yourself.,btohqsg
Throwing 100k from CPF OA to buy house Vs throwing 100k cash to buy house. The choice is obvious,btohqsg
Transfering OA to SA  your return is capped at 4%.By keeping in OA  your returns could be potentially higher.,btohqsg
Both option though is 100k. But psychologically there is a difference. OA can only use for housing while cash on hand can be used for so many things. I would rather use my OA for my house then touch my cash on hand. Do not want to restrict myself .,btohqsg
Can use Amaze+maybank F&F for selected categories to earn 8% and save on fx fees.Use maybank F&F directly to earn 8% under MYR category by spending in MYR1) On other spend (not in selected categories) but not in exclusion OR2) If exceeded rebate cap (S$312.50 spend) in selected category  and continue spend in the category in MYRCardup clock to minimum spend but only get 0.3% rebate,btohqsg
Yes. But I disagreed maybe is my need. If already know will not use for housing any times soon. Then why wait. Just transfer to SA for more interest. Of course if u knew u will use OA for investment or what then u need the 20k anyway to be requirement. Or else just transfer all to SA.All the SA will consider safety buffer for old age. By the time u buy house. You shld already built a lot more cash already. Just use the cash can already.Anyway is one choice. His opinion and my opinion both works. Just see your preference. No right and wrong answer.,btohqsg
I top up my CPF to FRS and maybe to ERS in the future. I see it as my backup in the event all my investment is gone. At least I still have the means to pay for my child education and other expenses if needed.,btohqsg
Child education can use OA  cannot use SA,btohqsg
Yep agreed with transferring to SA if one is dam sure not buying house.Also need to see the age profile of the person. If I am intending to buy house in 5-10 years. I am not only gonna leave 20k in OA and transfer the rest to SA.,btohqsg
Only can transfer OA to SA before SA reaches FRS?,btohqsg
Yeap once SA reach FRS can't transfer alr,btohqsg
Likely young. Of course if going to plan to marry soon then just keep as OA.,btohqsg
