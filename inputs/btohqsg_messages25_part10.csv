that function reports to telegram moderators. not chat moderators,btohqsg
This means you need to upload the documents before the date given. Once you clicked you will see what are the documents needed by hdb.,btohqsg
"I had this during my 1st HFE. Only received sms to check status n when you login  you see this ""upload documents""  you need to upload before the given date  n make sure you have upload all documents you want before you click submit. Once submitted  you can't upload anymore. If you realised you forgotten to upload the documents required  hdb would not process. Then 2 weeks later you will receive another sns to ask you check status  a tally is to ask you to upload another documents which actually you forgotten to upload earlier.",btohqsg
Yes  you can go in here also.,btohqsg
So for my HFE that I renewed (Expire on 11 Sep)  I submitted all doc in 1 shot  n I got my HFE approved within a week.,btohqsg
Mine totally no SMS or email,btohqsg
Same for 1st HFE  time wascwasted on the submission of doc which i didnt do n didnt submit all requested  after I submitted all docs  HFE was approved within a week too..So you need to submit..,btohqsg
Ok  i suggest you just go in to see what docs you need to submit n to upload.,btohqsg
Thank you! Now then they start asking hahah,btohqsg
is chencharu hills brochure out yet?,btohqsg
Cos since 18 August always stuck at this page,btohqsg
I see. Better quickly upload all needed in 1 shot otherwise wait n wait is another sms ask you to upload instead of approval.Becos last time after I submitted I realised I didn't submit 1 of the doc  then waited another 2 weeks  cos no more button for me to click upload. So wsitef 2 weeks again then I could upload.,btohqsg
seems like chenharu hills like no updates for brochure and stuff,btohqsg
Mine was approved in about 2-3 working days  I think v subjective ðŸ¥¶,btohqsg
How is hfe loan amount calculated ?,btohqsg
By you and ur spouse income,btohqsg
hfe application  education level  can i put my ongoing uni? or must be completed certification?,btohqsg
should be highest level obtained. ongoing uni not counted,btohqsg
Can i ask  if hdb invite u to go down and select flat  but by your turn not much left,btohqsg
See u can ask for waiver,btohqsg
If it's less than 10 units  you can get a waiver of non selection penalty,btohqsg
If more than 10 unit normally drop out then consider 2nd timer for a year?,btohqsg
The final say still hdb ba,btohqsg
Like what Housing Bot said  you can write in to HDB to clarify  but they have laid out 10 units as their criteria  so will need to see what they say,btohqsg
All the best to your bto journey.,btohqsg
Imho if invited for flat selection  if u cant waive it  i would encourage u to just select a unit. Its not worth to be 2nd timer for a year unless ur going for a resale flat instead of bto. 2nd timer is hard to get a number.,btohqsg
Later after 5 years mop can always sell and buy another flat that u like,btohqsg
If plus or prime not so easy to sell.,btohqsg
I heard if want to sell the buyer who bought as resale also need 10yrs Mop,btohqsg
Email hdb cuz i apply for next bto previously when my q out of supply,btohqsg
Today my friend also same problem.1. She applied Bedok BTO on Feb2024 and got Q number which is exceed 2002. Then she go for tanjong rhu BTO June 2024 and got Q number 1xxx within 2xxx.But now she received email from HDB go for selection of the bedok BTO and it has 200units leftover.But she doesnâ€™t keen it anymore she want tanjong rhu de. Could she ignore the call for bedok selection? And it could become 2nd timer or not,btohqsg
her queue number exceeded the number of units by 200? and it still has 200 units leftover now when it's reaching her?,btohqsg
Sorry i get confused.The correct is her Q exceed the number of people by 200. And now is her turn and already received email by HDB for selectio.,btohqsg
How about She still in the queue for tanjong rhu oh.,btohqsg
Cannot  her June application will be CANCELLED,btohqsg
Unless less than 10units balance for Feb BTO then appeal,btohqsg
All your ongoing flat application will be cancelled,btohqsg
Anyone knows Whats the last appointment timing for the day?,btohqsg
It depends on each project but usually after 8pm should be safe,btohqsg
Can i ask  this thing press proceed alr  still at pending? Is it no need to care one  just bring document down on the day,btohqsg
Yup after selection they will move on to next step,btohqsg
Hi guys can I ask if one of the applicant is a student and another applicant is a working party (been working for more than a year)  are we still eligible for the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
No need to click priceed  this one is to proceed to get a new hfe  so now you are gicen a date n time to book unit even if your hfe expired on booking day  you dont need to click proceed to apply new hfe. Just bring doc down.,btohqsg
by technicality  not eligible because both has to be studying or worked less than 12 months. however  you can try to appeal for DIA,btohqsg
