not for everyone but that’s like a lot of expensive dining,btohqsg
ord i treated my unit sushi,btohqsg
werent u gonna give it to me,btohqsg
but 2 adults plus 2 kids about 80+,btohqsg
I missed the restaurant name he was referring to opps,btohqsg
That's the first time I heard it from,btohqsg
Yup  definitely not my current taste but the lyrics is cool,btohqsg
at least theyre actually investigating uk,btohqsg
i was busy preparing for o’s cl oral,btohqsg
hahah bro hall itself  we all paid $40 from edusave 😂😂 dream on ah $10/person,btohqsg
oi focus on n’s first laaa that one can plan later,btohqsg
yes or was it 40 or 20 forgot,btohqsg
U mean how rich and how much the student’s parent donate,btohqsg
My brother is doing the same thing  he is part of a community that is tasked to plan a prom,btohqsg
School hall  standard buffet system…decorations counted  each student pays <100,btohqsg
$10 per pax and a hotel?,btohqsg
This is the first prom in 8 years  the last prom from my alma mater and my brother’s school was at ritz Carlton,btohqsg
Yep. That’s why my brother has been answering prom related qns since they announced it,btohqsg
And had to deal with major bullies and trolling for the last 4months,btohqsg
It got so bad they started attacking Teachers thinking they had a say,btohqsg
But the idea of prom was mostly a student venture with maybe 1 or 2 Teachers involved only,btohqsg
Bruh sec school was far from being the cream of the crop  when I was there for the first two years…they would confiscate your phone for two weeks,btohqsg
Like literally take your phone or Simcard for 2 weeks…parents can’t do anything for these two weeks,btohqsg
My brother has resorted to using the red packer honour system,btohqsg
The same way students put money in a red packet to “donate”,btohqsg
I mean there is a reason why proms are not universally done across all schools,btohqsg
Apart from students generally not favouring one  there is also the backlash from the ministry of education,btohqsg
Actually for the school my brother and I was from. It’s actually ok to choose our school hall because it’s air conditioned.,btohqsg
js when they switch it on ryan..,btohqsg
Tbh did no even experience much of the hall’s aircorn because I was part of the audio visual team,btohqsg
People sing national athem  the lot of the avcrew playing phone games in the control room…fun times,btohqsg
I mean most of the cost went to food,btohqsg
Like I heard 70% of it,btohqsg
Tables and chairs were reused from storage  decorations are mostly surpass from past events,btohqsg
Heard it’s optional so I take prob less than 500,btohqsg
Idk man  not my prom just putting the figures,btohqsg
yeah bro tf is 35$ being spent on  cn genuinely get lunch at a hotel for 35,btohqsg
The part that sucks is my school is rich af,btohqsg
School don’t want to fund any part of it,btohqsg
That is the students  it’s rich but they don’t spend money,btohqsg
If they have to they will,btohqsg
Maybe I’m wrong but 1mil seems like a lot,btohqsg
Basically money used to keep the school functional,btohqsg
3 million as a closing fund is higher than most,btohqsg
You know in manjusri  every 3 months there will be a student exchange,btohqsg
mu sec school used events for donation towards my sch upgrading lol. i saw he qr code the min amt was $50,btohqsg
mayb also cuz my sch is gov aided sch,btohqsg
