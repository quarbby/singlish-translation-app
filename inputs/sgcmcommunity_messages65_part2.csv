i first time. very confused ü•∫,btohqsg
cannot la. but she just shove me those forms,btohqsg
Dealers do sometimes increase price of car when submitting loan application to trick bank into approving full loan,btohqsg
Anyway if loan cannot approve dealer supposed to return your deposit,btohqsg
Full loan for used car.. not new car,btohqsg
I check many  COE IR around 3.18 and parf car 2.48,btohqsg
maybe if u want early repayment or when u sell ur car  fees will be super high,btohqsg
can only sell back to the same pax meh?,btohqsg
I see... But likely internal financing right? Won't be bank loan.,btohqsg
i dont think bank can do full legally,btohqsg
possible they do bank but its not legal,btohqsg
sorry what do you mean by this question?,btohqsg
i mean if you get the car from company A with super low interests  and when wanna sell  can only sell back to company A and not other companies?,btohqsg
can sell to other company  but u must settle ur loans from company A.,btohqsg
Company A may require you to pay super high fees for early repayment too offset the low interest.,btohqsg
oh wow...i din know there are such rules,btohqsg
c180 the most popular Coe car,btohqsg
dealers got a lot of patterns one la,btohqsg
some of their shenanigans if end up making them have bad rep  they just close the company set up new one,btohqsg
that's y better to find bigger dealers whose in the industry for a longer period,btohqsg
sometimes if you want peace of mind on top of PPI also get from dealer that have been around for at least 5 years and have good reviews,btohqsg
ya man...i din do my homework well,btohqsg
Thanks@Xipeng. Deleted and banned that fella,btohqsg
When u take 100% or near 100% loan  it  usually a private credit firm or in house loan. And in order to bypass mas  they will list the car at a marked up price so that your loan will not be flagged.,btohqsg
E.g. the car is 100k. By default u can only take 60k loan (60%). So in order for u to get a 100k loan  they need to raise the price to 166k.,btohqsg
So in your cse  its probably like a 70k car  but jacked up to 110k. So that ur loan can get about 66k (60%),btohqsg
So means to said your are paying intreast base on 110 k instead of 70 k,btohqsg
This one i cannot confirm  but it shouldn't be,btohqsg
Ballon loan should be like this,btohqsg
Car is 100 k down payment is 30 k to 40 k Depent on omv,btohqsg
So they pump up to 140 k so u won‚Äôt need to fork up down payment,btohqsg
When u take full loan  interest is already high in the first place  but i believe when they submit they will calculate the lower interest rate to contra the difference,btohqsg
Ballon scheme is a different thing,btohqsg
Umm true also but isn‚Äôt car loan fix,btohqsg
Balloon scheme is where by they sell u the car witbout its parf value,btohqsg
So at the end of the day,btohqsg
Then mutiply by the number of years,btohqsg
If something bad happen  you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù sell your car,btohqsg
Haiz‚Ä¶this is so complicated then buying a house,btohqsg
Or buy a coe car using full cash,btohqsg
U count the intreast of full loan over 10 years not scare Meh,btohqsg
But will the finance facility be checking the TDRS,btohqsg
I heard full loan can bypass tdsr,btohqsg
But if income can‚Äôt even pass tdsr dont buy car better,btohqsg
Car a lot of hidden cost 1,btohqsg
Technically it should be fixed. But i think they have ways to fly under the radere.g. 66k car  dp 40%  interest 3% over 7 years. Total interest paid is $8 316They jack up price to 110k  but submit interest at 1.8%  total interest paid  also  $8 316Just my theory hahaha,btohqsg
only difference u pay is the GST iirc,btohqsg
i cannot rmbr how the lowered interest loan works,btohqsg
but i know how they alter for u to take a higher loan amount,btohqsg
Haha just dealer paperwork  i dont think there is any liability on your side,btohqsg
