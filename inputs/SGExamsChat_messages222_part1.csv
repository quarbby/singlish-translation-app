I mean u end up taking the As regardless where u go,btohqsg
will scoring a better l1r5 make u do better for a lvls?,btohqsg
"U may get into a ""better"" JC",btohqsg
Which may help u do better in As,btohqsg
i can give all students in the worst JC resources/teachers from the best JC and they can still do way lower than national average,btohqsg
if u want me to be strict,btohqsg
"I always tell my bro This ""all sch is a good sch""",btohqsg
In the end still a sch and y'all sit for same paper,btohqsg
Did u mean to take pure sci in jc or,btohqsg
When inside u know its not true,btohqsg
ok this sounds a bit extreme,btohqsg
my point is  its your attitude that matters,btohqsg
Nope  you will pick up again in jc just stay focused thru out the 1.5 years,btohqsg
My principal told me that when I was sec 1,btohqsg
even in my sch itself there are ups teachers but theres only so much they can do,btohqsg
Maybe it's a phrase all principals use,btohqsg
And I diedie wan go jc,btohqsg
Yeah so having to retake makes it even more difficult to take up extra commitments!,btohqsg
Unless u mean the research kind,btohqsg
Well based on my results now,btohqsg
@chemcerif u want H3  all jcs offer it,btohqsg
If it leads u to where u want faster?,btohqsg
Didn't get the score I wanted,btohqsg
Are u IB? I thot u Os,btohqsg
those niche ones then maybe some jcs dont have,btohqsg
And h3 selection is based on ur yesr 1 grades,btohqsg
I share acc w my broAron,btohqsg
Relative to the cohort (i think),btohqsg
siao on has limits also ah,btohqsg
Is H3 a must? It seems so tiring thou,btohqsg
u gonna fight with chem ppl from chem RA,btohqsg
and their chem is quite godly alr,btohqsg
the reason they are so godly is cos,btohqsg
they do extra reading on their own,btohqsg
my friend managed it coming from non chem ra background i think but he srsly trade away his life,btohqsg
Not sure if u want to follow la,btohqsg
they straight up pon almost half the lessons for everyth else,btohqsg
i nvr see my friend for like 2 terms in a row cuz he mugging chem like siao,btohqsg
but if they can cope in all other subjects its fine also,btohqsg
95% of jc ppl dont even take a h3?,btohqsg
Just go look in the mirror ask urself 1 qn,btohqsg
Unless u confident of getting all A,btohqsg
If udw then don't bother unless for fun,btohqsg
i mean now seeing o lvl results gives u a rough impression of the cohort's standard le,btohqsg
I went through j1 like that,btohqsg
like the subject grades u get for o lvl right,btohqsg
as long as its between A1-B3  u have a fair chance of getting A for that subject at A lvls (esp for A1/A2),btohqsg
with the right attitude  knowledge is easily acquired,btohqsg
b3 is more unlikely  but still possible.,btohqsg
J1 is for u to fk around have fun,btohqsg
