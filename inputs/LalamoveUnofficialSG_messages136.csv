Honestly  I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äòpooling‚Äô pricing model nowadays makes sense. It‚Äôs designed for clients who want lower fees and claim tat allows us as driver to take multiple jobs on the same route. But in my experience  supply exceeds demand right now  so it‚Äôs hard to find other jobs along the way. And I totally agree with some of you‚Äîsome clients choose pooling ald but still expect direct service  then some even question why the delivery is delayed  where they tot should be deliver within one hour  immediately after they place order. Where I feel really not fair for the rider/driver. Lalamove claiming that ‚Äúpooling‚Äù helps drivers plan their routes and save on fuel is misleading. It‚Äôs more like a scam.Who agree with me? üëá,btohqsg
Thats why if remarks stated direct/urgent  i will just ignore.,btohqsg
And then we ask ourselves why we still do lala lol,btohqsg
Then client sometimes want to teach us  but they the one who need lesson,btohqsg
But no choice  lala will forever take customers side,btohqsg
Nothing that llm does is for us. It's only for the vendors/customer cos without them they no make money. So to them customer is king. Low priced jobs  just don't take. Simple as that.,btohqsg
When llm says pooling job u can slowly do  it's just to trick drivers I to taking the low priced jobs. Then their customers can save money then will keep using llm. Simple as that. We r expendable  not impt to llm. Because 1 of us leave  many other new blur drivers or foreigners will take our place,btohqsg
If you all still harbour any hope of llm being good platform for drivers or will take your side  please just wake up your f***ing idea. Simple as that. Pardon me if I offend any of you. It's the harsh reality,btohqsg
10m toto on monday  good luck.,btohqsg
Hi guysAirport loading bay can we enter?Van driver here .Or need register,btohqsg
Looking for delivery driverÔºöTIMEÔºöanytime before 6pmPICK UP: 388393DROP OFFÔºö797478Item: Fresh FlowerTotal: $12,btohqsg
I reached place and user cancelled,btohqsg
CS say i not entitled to reimbursement cos user cancel within 9 mins. So next time get order  dont go first until 10 mins later,btohqsg
This CS‚Äôs England very Powderful! Lol üòú,btohqsg
This is SOP  for Priority 9mins for customers to cancel and u must remember to call them for proof (record of call log) if schedule order is 30mins before pickup time.,btohqsg
I just kena yesterday for not calling first before coming down  but it was for compensation for additional waiting time. I just resorted to taking matters on my own hands since the disclaimer is on the website already lol.,btohqsg
So at the end of the day  sometimes we just need to suck thumb and deal with it.,btohqsg
Actually  just operate like how their rules Sing. Go with the flow  a lot can be done.,btohqsg
Really the rates are getting worse today,btohqsg
Not just today everyday also jialat,btohqsg
Probably the Lalamove management guys don‚Äôt own a car‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt know such jialat prices!,btohqsg
Not just everyday it's been years,btohqsg
Why they nvr select door to door service,btohqsg
Shall we start rejecting them. And start asking them to select door to door. Our price is cheaper than grab. Driving a 2.4m van here,btohqsg
The company scare what? you guys dont do  stil got alot foreigner with fake account will do,btohqsg
that's why they dont implement face verfication,btohqsg
because they know if they implement  50% job  no one will take,btohqsg
Prices that are cheap  just ignore. Customer who really cant wait will eventually add additional sum of money till the price is right then take it.. that's how it should be since last 2-3 years ago.. but nowdays partners take the job never think of others. That's why the price became like this. Yes nowdays the price is cheaper then other platforms if compare distances. So  if all of us work together eventually the price will be back to normal as in higher prices. Remember all the price that came out in the job have not been deducted yet. Please be smart guys.. or else this thing will prolong and everyone will suffer in days to come.,btohqsg
As for foreigner do take part in report if u guys ever encounter with them personally.,btohqsg
Today they just started but on beta,btohqsg
So now its up to us..,btohqsg
If you see any foreigners taking job post it here I will try report to the authorities under government agencies and make sure related personal get it including llm  never get heavy fine beforehand never know what it take..,btohqsg
Telegram inside got its own delivery chat. Inside got how many malaysian,btohqsg
Simple Catch the main personal first LLM‚Ä¶ they have to answer for it or get heavily fine for accepting foreigners to do the dirty jobs,btohqsg
Get all the details and photos and make it right first so authorizes can question Llm and they have to answer for it  we have the right to question MOM if still unavailable go to see Lawrence Wong now is election period we are on advantage,btohqsg
MOM wont care. Have to go to NDCA,btohqsg
Get the proof with photos and details .. no details how to report without any proof,btohqsg
Get opposite party‚Äôs to bring it on to parliament section for discussion,btohqsg
See illegal bike hitch also got msian lol,btohqsg
Definitely they dont have work pass to do LLM. Maybe work pass in different sector. Cause work pass cant apply for lalamove. Only SG or PR able too. So it means they are breaking the law. Both owner of the app and the illegal rider will be fine $5000 & for the foreigner will be ban from entering SG. Same thing applied for other platforms. Call police on the spot  they will be cuff and lock up immediately. Law is law.,btohqsg
Dear Sifus  im doing lala for pt adhoc.. finding extra money for petrol n pay for own car.. may i ask  mon n tues usually low orders is it?,btohqsg
They just protect customer rather than protect driver   unlike grab   50/50,btohqsg
Nowadays alot of loan shark case using llm and grab (cod) on their problems   just be careful when you take your orders,btohqsg
Hope that llm customer must link singpass before signing up   same as driver signing up must link to have equality  no foreigner should be able to do llm in sg,btohqsg
Pooling customers like king. Want fast,btohqsg
The weather nowdays is so so bad. Terribly hot. Why want suffer for the pathetic llm price,btohqsg
Its ok. Don't forget to buy toto  good luck tmr. Hope can win so can leave group lol,btohqsg
Who won 13m? Share abit lah... 10k also can.,btohqsg
Haha now you also anti llm alr ah,btohqsg
And customer still don't care ah ordered pooling but still demanding. No stack lah  must direct lah  urgent lah.,btohqsg
The last thing those rich will do in Singapore is to give poor money to,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt even tips $1  in their entire life  still expect them to give $10k? HAHAHAHAAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHA,btohqsg
Just take the order and f them. I ever took a super cheapo order. I just swipe and give them up down left right. Want fast want cheap. Cos esp at certain hours  they know Grab is super ex so they resort to LLM.,btohqsg
Cos myself is a consumer. Want urgent  go choose grab. definitely more ex but delivery straight point A to point B. I always use this basis. cheapskate but want all urgent,btohqsg
Let go Llm go others application or create own delivery team  you think talk here they will improve or care  no way la,btohqsg
Today you discuss tomorrow someone talk same issues again there isn‚Äôt any ending,btohqsg
I'm not asking LLM to improve. We ask LLM to improve end up ownself heartpain . We as a driver must teach this consumer a lesson at times,btohqsg
It's a choice  either lan lan suck thumb just follow LLM rates. Dun like it  just go other platform.,btohqsg
Consumer also same la  is under BtoB they are all business man you think they are stupid or what?,btohqsg
Huh? What talking u consumer also business man üòÜ,btohqsg
You all discuss in public they come in here quietly see all the discussion and they will act accordingly,btohqsg
Do you know what is B and B.. you think consumer can afford everyday call for business and good rate for you to pickups ahhhh,btohqsg
All are under business related leh,btohqsg
You see this few years got so many logistics companies register for business all are related this is called business to business,btohqsg
U got see LLM rate anot? Urself as a driver can accept Sengkang go CCK $12 for car job?,btohqsg
LLM oso one of them  they are connected with logistics companies for business relationships,btohqsg
We use petrol ley not water. If u can accept so be it. Some has to sustain rental and all. Aiyohhh,btohqsg
I think no point talking to u lah hor. If u as a driver stand by LLM policies and rates  so be it. No one is forcing u,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt take lor if you feel uncomfortable  take already boil blood ü©∏ for what later something happens more worst,btohqsg
Isn't that what I said earlier? üòí,btohqsg
Aiya no happy don‚Äôt work lor people never put a gun on your head to force you do,btohqsg

Really from bad to worse. Nearly 100km the fare only $63. After comms maybe 50+,btohqsg
But somehow there's always people out there taking up these underpaid jobs and encourage llm to lower their price further,btohqsg
The only b2b I want is body2body,btohqsg
Always everyday see the same complaints here,btohqsg
Then expect  changes be it by llm or vendors,btohqsg
Won't happen lah. Shit price just don't do.,btohqsg
If will change would have changed already lah,btohqsg
If want do  just do. Of course I also got complain  always. But what to do. Sometimes we ease our mental burden by complaining lol,btohqsg

I checked the price info and saw price adjustment by CS -$7. I tell them to cancel they don‚Äôt want to cancel. Super shady Getz and llm,btohqsg
Last time they will put out a job with +$,btohqsg
Then even after u take it,btohqsg
As long as haven't pick up  they will put out the same job again at lower price. If pple bid the job then ur job will n cancelled üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
1 job after a couple of minutes maybe no more high demand surcharge then they will quickly cancel n change,btohqsg
I think GETZ & LLM under the same umbrella.,btohqsg
Getz just another delivery platform that use llm,btohqsg
But anyway all is like that 1,btohqsg
But the problem is after they cancelled the order I took  I didn‚Äôt accept their new order. They auto assigned to me,btohqsg
They can do anytg they wantüòÇ,btohqsg

they will just copy paste answer and fuck off,btohqsg
I quickly slide pick up order when i reached because I knew this client trying to cancel and dont pay anything,btohqsg
But customer still manage to cancel order after i pick up,btohqsg
What a fcking rubbish llm system,btohqsg
They allow customer to cancel after we pick up and deliver?,btohqsg

You know wat sometime client will cancel on rider when they wan save money if they need a sedan??,btohqsg
This happened to me 2 days back. Not duplicate order but this guy is a joke. I was riding on expressway saw this order n was along the way as I'm heading from toapayoh to town didn't mind to do a quicker order. In the end I communicated with the customer on chat saying I will reach in 15-20mins. When arrived the customer cancelled on me. And I was given $2.50 cancellation fee despite wasting my 20mins to travel down. And today CS contacted me and want me to contact them because I missed their call. So now I contacted helpline for this case and they said this fkn cheapo customer expect n wants a refund. Maybe i shdve jst ignored them,btohqsg
Toapayoh to orchard then back to toapayoh order. Pooling for just $11.50 he should be thankful I reached in 20mins to collect yet this fker cancelled on me and demand CS for cancellation fee back for just $2.50 after wasting my time to arrive at toapayoh for him  waste my time yet he is cheapo until now demands CS for this $2.50 cancellation fee back like WTF. And now CS siding him n agreed to pay him back the cancellation fee say I never call the customer when I was riding how I call. Damn cb,btohqsg
If only I clicked call or saved his number. I will call him back now or go down his location door and confront him this ridiculous cheapo. This is how I know I never ever want to take pooling orders anymore. Pooling order clearly stated pickup before 2hours and I did within 20mins and he cancelled on me instead after I arrived muddafker,btohqsg
Not that I want his filthy $2.50 and him being so cheapo n that CS has to harass me to claim back his 2.50 rly disgust me n waste my time,btohqsg
This kind of people really should deserve a big time whack or scolding,btohqsg
Fk all the pooling orders customer that expect immediate collection n always hurrying us rider. Like this guy  cheapo ask for pooling yet wants immediate pickup and I arrived within 20mins he cancelled on me like wtf,btohqsg
Wasted didn't catch his full address  and HP number if not cfm call or confront him for a big scolding,btohqsg
Was on the way 2 days back,btohqsg
That's why I learnt my lesson never ever take pooling orders anymore,btohqsg
Regardless on the way anot lol because all cheapo customers that set pooling yet demanding fast delivery frkn irritating,btohqsg
Yup2...just dont support cheapo customer. They want cheap  let them send the item themselves.,btohqsg
Yeaa we need to boycott ALL pooling orders honestly fk them,btohqsg
Regardless on the way for us anot,btohqsg
We need all lalamove riders or do Part time or full time to be in this group and know this message lol,btohqsg
Anyway guys.. just try to call customer b4 proceeding to collection point to confirm on the job & item descriptions. No point u text in the app. Atleast if u call u have the call log u will get 50% compensation. I learn my lesson last 2 years ago.. üòÖ they never answer call i wont go.. cause there's alot of scammer... take note so we wont waste our time... üëåüí™,btohqsg
Or can just take those that pay with credit,btohqsg
Truee but just sad I didn't because I was riding and I don't have Bluetooth headset in my helmet call already can't talk while riding,btohqsg
Or possible to just click call then end call? Just for the call log evidence lol,btohqsg
But nowadays lalamove money not a lot not worth doing hahaah and with all these kinda of cheapo customers n pooling order nonsense very annoying thankfully this is just a past time for me since I'm free now,btohqsg
Already done that long time ago... i wont even take cheap prices to be honest. If cheap prices i can get non stop doing grabfood or deliveroo... lalamove is a courier services. So courier services is totally different from food delivery. More better  last 10yrs ago... express delivery must complete in 1hr time  payment is $30-50. Last time cost of living also not bad.. now cost of living so bad... prices getting lower  if there's someone still took it cant blame anyone else cause the person itself is supporting/agreeing to that kind of fees. We need to work wisely. Remember  you are in the road. Risky job  accident may appear anytime. Stay safe.,btohqsg
Last time lalamove courier service can 1hour earn 30-50?!,btohqsg
Yup2... im in delivery line for 21yrs already. Last time earn so much and no one knows too.. never got viral.. nowdays they earn so much  post in socmed all want to do... then prices all getting lower.. might as well dont do... üòÖ,btohqsg
Now bike... bruh.. last time van earn sooo good.. hahha.. now i dk how ppl survive using van or car.... with traffic so bad and parking so troublesome...,btohqsg
Not adding fuel cost is crazyy!,btohqsg
Yes last time llm good money. Especially during covid time. At that period no1 want do cos scared covid. Prices were good. Even 1+ yr after lockdown gone also good,btohqsg
Then after that the prices start to cui. And more pple start to do. Saturated. Orders less drivers more. N llm go adjust the prices with all the shit stuff cos have to lower price to attract customers. N of cos more foreigners start to do.,btohqsg
Ironically price low then more n more pple come doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Last time 1 job can earn 30+ liao lor,btohqsg
Do a stack also can get 50+,btohqsg
For me I joined just b4 lockdown,btohqsg
Can stack n stack cos no traffic. 1 hr can do 3 4 jobs even if get the right stack,btohqsg
Now so pathetic each order barely 10dollars depends on distance,btohqsg
And now u're still doing with car?,btohqsg
I can't see van so I dunno,btohqsg
Car worth it? Pay fuel alr not worth hahaha,btohqsg
Last time very worth. Price very high,btohqsg
Right  car not worth to do Full time. Drive car just to be stuck in traffic n pay off fuel already nothing left hahaha,btohqsg
Do a wkend from Fri to Sun. Basically at least 200+ for each of the 3 days,btohqsg
Wkday also can at least 100-200,btohqsg
Now cannot lah. Last time no traffic n price high is huat 1,btohqsg
Hahaha cannot compare to covid times very diff,btohqsg
I didn't do lalamove until recently started to try since free,btohqsg
Customer ridiculous is everywhere for every platform 1 lah,btohqsg
One month ago I sent one order  the customer complain to lalamove say never received,btohqsg
I sent and once lift opened she open the door take and immediately go in,btohqsg
I didn't even hve time take pic,btohqsg
So I snap pic of her door instead  Chinese national,btohqsg
Frkn cheapskate and putting the blame on me,btohqsg
I still rmb the exact address if lalamove ended up fault me I'm gonna go knock on her door and confront. Crazy,btohqsg
I've been lucky ü§ûnvr kena any jialat customers so far. Worse was 1 time deliver branded stuff to a china customer at condo. She not at hm. Call her no answer. So left the item at the door after asking the vendor how. Vendor say leave at door,btohqsg
And lalamove CS frkn shit... Always siding the customers and fault us drivers n deduct on us every single time when thrs issue even tho we r not at fault,btohqsg
Then after that when I left 10-15 mins liao the customer call my hp kpkb me. Say how can I leave at the door. Later cleaner etc take how,btohqsg
Yaaa so scary imagine leave at door n disappear became our fault those rly scary,btohqsg
I took coach  Prada etc before always super scared n take pictures properly after seeing cheapskates customer,btohqsg
I just tell her u not at home. I call u u don't answer. I ask vendor they say leave at door. I've done what I need to do liao. Then I hang up,btohqsg
Then call vendor say the customer may call u cos they call me kpkb,btohqsg
End up the vendor add me as favourite üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Just make sure u got call log  and message the customer n vendor n keep the records. N of cos take photo. All these cover ur ass,btohqsg
Our job is deliver from a to b  that's it,btohqsg
The annoying part is CS has those records when we sent photo n chat records with customer and us,btohqsg
But they don't go read n put all allegations on us,btohqsg
So rly I'm saying all these for all to becareful,btohqsg
F them also no use 1,btohqsg
So don't waste time n energy,btohqsg
Don't need lah. Must let the drivers learn themselves. Ownself experience lesson then will learn n remember 1,btohqsg
Same for which vendor good  dirty  pattern many  parking how etc,btohqsg
Lalamove rly damn shitty in CS,btohqsg
Did u take the fuel card alr?,btohqsg
How it works  I've been wanting to take hahaha,btohqsg
Frm their admin office or smth I heard,btohqsg
The fuel card is for esso,btohqsg
Also is it worth buying that nonsense lalakit just to get order quicker and guaranteed?,btohqsg
For u to collect smile pts or something n discount,btohqsg
I go caltex get 22% using llm app,btohqsg
But cannot get link pts. But I don't bother with the pts,btohqsg
U bike issit. I don't believe in the get order quicker and guaranteed. I've tried various scenarios with my friends who have sticker/no sticker  based on distance  based on rating  etc,btohqsg
Sometimes want good orders always get snatched so I'm thinking those get lalakit is it rly once swipe don't need to wait n always get?,btohqsg
Last time I heard bike must get the bag then can. Now I dunno,btohqsg
Wow didn't knw haahah 22% off?,btohqsg
All can find in the app. Another example u must b nvr read upüòÇ,btohqsg
So even have lalakit  once swipe not straight get order? Must wait for the seconds countdown?,btohqsg
For car. It's a must last time for mpv n van etc. Not for car. But supposedly put the sticker can get the job easier etc,btohqsg
Sometimes it's good to read up everytg. Like got certain fees etc  for purchase services etc. Pple who don't read  will just blur blur buy stuff for customer when they nvr add in the purchase fee in the job,btohqsg
This I dunno cos I no lalakit,btohqsg
But I got win sticker driver when bidding b4 lahüòÇ,btohqsg
N got non sticker driver with worse rating and further away from pickup pt win a bid which I bidding for also. N the app showed the standard msg saying can win bid better if I put sticker. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I have even experienced b4. I waiting for a job to +$. I drove to the mall n park. Then the job disappear from my app. I went up to ask the resto if got pple take liao. They check n say haven't ask me want take borü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ I say my app no show liaoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Then I drive off  after awhile appear again. So the app system is shit 1üòÇ,btohqsg
I really miss doing covid time..thats the best.,btohqsg
Or before covid was even better,btohqsg
So long never do till today i try..i see the price i laugh sia..,btohqsg
That's what I mean by all in the past,btohqsg
So little jobs still want mission mehüòÇ,btohqsg
Plus the mission incentive so low  is insulting drivers lor,btohqsg
Works out to 1 job extra $1+ incentive. Kns drivers r beggars issit,btohqsg
Do grab food incentives better than do this lol,btohqsg
This order hoseh Bo? Pick up 4:20 and deliver by 4:30. Parking and walk don‚Äôt need time ?,btohqsg
Hi folks. Usually i go caltex pump cos no need special card but just applied and got shell card  just now use but no discount at all. Will it be reflected during monthly billing instead? The FAQ online says instant discount at pump  but wanted to check with shell fleet card users first.,btohqsg
if you just applied how you get so fast? they suppose to mail you the physical shell card,btohqsg
Just applied 2 weeks back. Got it in mail 2 days back.Used today.,btohqsg
I got mission after MIA from LLM for almost 3 months. See the mission incentives straight away close the app üòÇ,btohqsg
U nvr take all the oddle rescue jobs tdy ahüòÇ,btohqsg
SMLJ. Don‚Äôt take Oddle already. Time bomb for any driver. Take sure kena from receipient or kena poke backside from the shop after delivery.,btohqsg
I still see so many jobs  plus $1-$5 max without base fare.,btohqsg
And if you follow GPS link   +20min cos the location salah,btohqsg
U scam how much liao? Shld share with pple here,btohqsg
Ask admin to remove this bangau,btohqsg
All the oddle rescue orders panicking leow üòÇ stil no one take.,btohqsg
Anyway they dig their own grave soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg

How come i no mission one,btohqsg
Wat was ur mileage for that day,btohqsg
The mission incentive like shit. Works out to $1 odd per job. Wat for u want mission,btohqsg
I see on average it's only $14/job. For a car. That's damn little leh.,btohqsg
There r jobs with much better value,btohqsg
I didn't do on the wkend that just passed,btohqsg
But I saw jobs with much more decent price during last wkend,btohqsg
$14/job on average in long run is waste time n petrol 1,btohqsg
Wat was ur mileage for that sat,btohqsg
I think u do phv might make moreüòÇ,btohqsg
But that 1 timing to what time?,btohqsg
So this kind of order is good?,btohqsg
This is the new rates after Covid.,btohqsg
This cannot lah. What u make after  com is less than ur total mileage for the job leh,btohqsg
I do peak period only if do,btohqsg
Don't do llm alot liao nowdays,btohqsg
Only makes sense if you risk going into JB to refuel,btohqsg
More don't make sense. If kena caught the fine wipe put few days earningsüòÇ,btohqsg
UserGraceson ?has 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no chat links here!,btohqsg

They should put comment section for driver to write comment on this kind of job,btohqsg
Now I have truly seen it all. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Can i see for lalamove van 1.7m 8hrs job can get how much?,btohqsg
Pre Covid - $350 easilyPost Covid - $250 longer hours,btohqsg
PHV 8hrs from a fren of mine said $25012hrs is $300,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I say longer hours mahh? ü§£,btohqsg
Depends on the number of hours you commit lor?,btohqsg
Sure tired if want make decent amt,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA! Plus the jam and what not. Haven‚Äôt include passengers who have different kinda patterns. ü§£,btohqsg
If you got PHV  can always give it a try. But if you‚Äôre young ( less than 40 years old )  I suggest don‚Äôt do. Better build your CPF. Agreed money you don‚Äôt see  but in the long run. It‚Äôs for a roof over your head.,btohqsg
Only if your bike is fast...,btohqsg
Yes must be at least 50km so that it make sense can do more delivery within the time frame,btohqsg
Bike do llm can make decent money as costs from petrol n parking is way lower than car. But is tougher cos ride bike exposed to the weather conditions. But it's give and take lor. Car more comfortable but prices bad n costs high,btohqsg
Anyone got mission today and tmr,btohqsg
We can only take 2 order a time how to earn money like that. lol.,btohqsg
Sorry I‚Äôm new here hope to learn more.,btohqsg
Quit early before u face further disappointment,btohqsg
So lucky. Must be only to new drivers ba.,btohqsg
Best advice to u  if u drive car  just quit lalamove if u planning to do full time,btohqsg
last time when i new to lalamove i rent car and work lalamove at the end not even earn single cent plus loss money somemore.,btohqsg
now even difficult and tough because cannot take more than one job hahaha,btohqsg
Then only can do it part time lo.,btohqsg
Sad case. I tot lala move can make money. Haha.,btohqsg
Grab confirm better. No need load and unload. Find parking. Drive car summore need risk illegal parking sometimes,btohqsg
Ya lo. Cb lala think erp n parking free,btohqsg
Wah rent car even more jialat,btohqsg
No ah  they already write say the fees r included in the price liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
You driving car to do huh,btohqsg
Fare low still needs to pay parking. Stupid one never think for driver,btohqsg
Hi senior  can i know how long will it take to credit into my bank if I cash out today? Thanks bosses,btohqsg
Hi all just   just wanna check have anyone experience  customer claimreceiver received parcel but inside open empty item missing  assume rider open and wish to make a report,btohqsg
They claim against lalamove  have insurance up to few hundred$ only.U don‚Äôt need to interact with the customer directlyWait get scammedU just wait for lalamove deduct ur wallet only‚Ä¶ lolThen appeal if they even let uSadly this is the SOP  no other way,btohqsg
Understand‚Ä¶ thank you so much. Cuz they say want make police report   I say ok cuz I never take nothing to worry.. thanks for sharing the info ya,btohqsg
Tell them to email lalamove.Offical black and whiteThe way they put it feels like they are out to scam your money. Either the sender or receiver deceive sender pushing blame to u.,btohqsg
Is it just me or lately (this few days) the jobs and prices are getting more and more shitty,btohqsg
I do lalamove for 1 week using car and i quit hahaha price only cover petrol and cashcard but not rental üòÅ,btohqsg
Rent car do llm is worst thing to do,btohqsg
Nowadays only can do if you‚Äôre on the way or really need money,btohqsg
Planing to do PHV part time,btohqsg
I have full time job just that want to try  lalamove part time i did i rent out car weekly 455$ than do LLM weekly earning is $510 so to me is not worth it,btohqsg
I thought like can get $1k for weekly at least i can earn abit üòÇ,btohqsg
For LLM like 10pm the job slow already,btohqsg
Maybe ill try out Van see how soon,btohqsg
Just testing out which side hustle is can earn one,btohqsg
This is part time after full time job btw for those want to know roughly,btohqsg
And i did stack 2 at times,btohqsg
It doesnt make sense u rent a ‚Äúfull‚Äù time vehicle to work part time job  no side hustle can double the revenue and let u take home profitU were basically looking for min. $20 per drop which is not possible,btohqsg
37 X $20 = $740And even then after petrol u only take back $100 for all that effort  around 15 hours,btohqsg
My motive was try not to touch on my main income that‚Äôs all since i have to use my main income for petrol i find it cannot la,btohqsg
Tough lahh Bro. Maybe can do LLM when raining or peak. Other than that. Do full time  confirm not worth it.,btohqsg
Yea maybe LLM i will do on peak timing like what the other guys share me i will take note on that,btohqsg
Yea that of course but i part time only,btohqsg
Can cover abit rental i‚Äôm ok ar,btohqsg
But planning to change to van,btohqsg
Throw out the rental car üòÇ,btohqsg
But at least increase abit right?,btohqsg
Van rental is cheaper than car,btohqsg
Oh no i thought will be same like car,btohqsg
Wah lucky i check with u guys,btohqsg
Was planning to change to van,btohqsg
But if van parcel ok to do?,btohqsg
Why? The fuel consumption rabak is it?,btohqsg
No la thought of changing to van because thought can get more but actually info from the guys here not much,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to change. As long as your boot space big  can stack. But stack reasonably. Later no reason kena complain. üòî,btohqsg
The commission for van without sticker rabak sia,btohqsg
If u wan to do van u need to know which order can do and which cannot do. And your cancellation rate will be fucking high due to those ppl who misuse the app. Such as washing machine with no helper $$ added  and all kind of rubbish.,btohqsg
Even u get those van job with high price also dun be too happy.,btohqsg
They will tell u that I had a 2.4mtr sofa with no manpower added and no one to assist in moving,btohqsg
I had been a 2.4 driver for many yrs....last time the price is good and alot of order and less driver. And user will add on money if u are reasonable. Now diff .less order and many driver. And all the driver are bangala!! And because of them willing to do this shit price that's why lalamove keep on lowing down the price!! And user know if u dun do shit things at shit price other will do ! And now the stupid quality bar is the worst things! All kind of cancellation will drop the bar. Once the bar if empty 3 times . Good luck. Will cus permanently banned from lalla,btohqsg
Yes no sticker for shit price 1.7 after com is only $19,btohqsg
They drive 14ft also take 2.4 van  10ft lorry jobs,btohqsg
But I just converted my panda acc from bike to car,btohqsg
Try a shift with van and see if better,btohqsg
No need scared big panda mart order üòÇ,btohqsg
Lala only can do during holiday season or high demand price only now,btohqsg
So for that fren who wan use van do lala must think,btohqsg
Arh.. I dun know. In mine time is $5,btohqsg
Yeah llm think they are grab doing transport service. They dun understand for logistics there is no high or low demand. Ppl need van means they need. Dun need means they dun need,btohqsg
Yeah because of them llm dare to do shit price. They know if u dun do they will,btohqsg
You know Wats the best things for oddle??,btohqsg
You jus take any photo to live chat and tell them item is overload and need change to MPV,btohqsg
And they will not ask the client,btohqsg
But I must check the price b4 you ask to change,btohqsg
You can live chat and they will change to MPV price,btohqsg
Actually only courier can do lala,btohqsg
And oddly order if u see duplicate jus swipe on both,btohqsg
But oddle u must be alert,btohqsg
Oddle can only stack after 3 min after the first oddle u take,btohqsg
You can't even go in B4 3min it's lock,btohqsg
Cus they dun wan oddle to say driver stack order that's why delivery late,btohqsg
You u miss the stack and dun wan go jus call the restaurant and hang up 3 times and screen shot to live chat and say client no response,btohqsg
Or jus say restaurant est timming can't be out for the pick up timming,btohqsg
This price of convert to Bangala currency is big. That‚Äôs why LLM take advantage of this.,btohqsg
Nowadays I saw last got fix surcharge. SMLJ.,btohqsg

Yes they always problem.. I kena with them always.. you call also it‚Äôs the staff number.. their boss the one make payment and always delay and ignore,btohqsg
Next time haven‚Äôt receive payment don‚Äôt release the item. Tell receiver to pay you if they want the item but sender wanna run the payment,btohqsg
Coz they say will paynow after delivery complete..,btohqsg

Got once I kena customer like that. I withhold the item while infront of customer. I called the sender and open loudspeaker for the other party to hear.
