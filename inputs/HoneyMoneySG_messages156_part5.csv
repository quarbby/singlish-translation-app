Omg…. I checked my statement… in 2024 it’s call voluntary contribution.. in 2023 (I gotten the tax relief) it’s call RST contribution.. is it this is the reason I not entitled for the tax relief?,btohqsg
Different thing. Voluntary contribution is not RSTU. No tax relief.,btohqsg
Omg…. Do you think if I contact CPF they will fix for me?? There is no reason I contribute for fun… I only contribute for the tax relief…. 🥲🥲,btohqsg
They unlikely to fix but you can try. If your transaction code is CON then confirm wrong. It has to be RST.,btohqsg

Same. Mine uob one card. Use 2k+ every month for years. Suddenly dont want to approve annual fee waiver. Collect your rebates first b4 you cancel card,btohqsg
I have cash credit at both cards,btohqsg
I told UOB CS that I will close all my accounts with UOB if they did not waive my annual fees,btohqsg
UOB KF the only one worth to pay annual fee,btohqsg
Never pay any annual ever since I hold credit cards,btohqsg
Only OCBC offer credit card without annual fee,btohqsg
Use your cash credits first . Then cancel.,btohqsg
Almost $200 for 10k KF miles leh. OCBC credit card no annual fee if you hit min spend,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
Unless UOB changes that fact or not UOB KF is the only one really worth (if you after SQ miles  that is). Depends on your spending la. I dont hit OCBC min spend so I dont like OCBC.,btohqsg
almost 2 cents per mile worth it meh,btohqsg

For big ticket furniture  Instore tap  what is a good card to used since crmc is no longer viable?,btohqsg
Compared to only earning 4mpd or even 12mpd (3mpd from UOB KF Kris+ & 9mpd from selected Kris+ merchants themselves)  tell me a better way to earn it then. Yuu?,btohqsg
all these are free in a way. most ppl value miles 1.25-1.5 cents per mile  no where close to 2 cents per mile,btohqsg
One is reward for spending. While the other is PURCHASING the reward (not free).,btohqsg
To me  whether its spending or purchase  I am only interested in the earn rate and end-value.Coz whether its spending on the credit card or purchasing the miles  the money at the end still leaves your bank account.,btohqsg
all those 4mpd are rewards u get on top of whichever goods and service u paid for,btohqsg
I rather purchase 10k miles at $200 then to spend $2.5k extra (or for 12mpd case  $834,btohqsg
Take me as a penny pincher. Plus these miles are not expiring immediately (validity of 3 years  given how you spend) so why not? Plus you can reduce miles (but with some luck) on Spontaneous Escapes and maybe other airlines (use KF miles but for other airlines - might be cheaper  not always) so why not?,btohqsg
Ask for AF waiver and use UOB Key for the payment Facility only pay 1.8% instead of 2%,btohqsg
Only up to 30 Apr 2025... Other than the bank account as well... not a long term solution. Dont know how much UOB will approve and... 1mpd? I doubt the admin fee can earn miles (or earn that much) but its not stated. Abit dubious about this.,btohqsg
should use cpm not mpd here,btohqsg
"The air miles here refer to the UOB rewards or something iirc. Or the UNI$2.5 for their rewards.Not used to the rewards program. Besides  anything to go wrong  the airline cannot settle coz the booking is considered to be a ""3rd party booking"". Not wrong to go this route as well but not comfortable for me.",btohqsg
The Annual fee is one off and only up to 10k miles. Pay facility is dependent on your credit limit which for some people can be quite large definitely more than the 10k miles from the AF,btohqsg
Is UOB FX plus spending counted towards UOB one spend criteria?,btohqsg
Hi anyone on classpass charging subscription with cbmc  directly ? Does it still give 4 mpd ?,btohqsg
Lets see coz to transfer miles also a problem + admin fee + alot of stuff going on + quite sure its 2.3%. Just looking at sure ways that are more steady or well known as compared to this way (but thanks for letting me know... will consider next time coz Im keeping my spending low).,btohqsg
I think u are a bit confused between:1. Paying for miles with cash and not getting any productAnd2. Buying day to day products and earning miles for the purchase.,btohqsg
Overall  money still comes out of your pocket and depends on how you spend.,btohqsg
The end-product (whether buying miles this way or day-to-day) is to get the most value of a mile and redeem flight tickets (which obviously we are only paying tax).Unless you are telling me you are earning the miles and converting to use them on Kris+?,btohqsg
Your theory only works if u are spending day to day expenses at cash accepting only merchants that charge prices lower than merchants that accept credit cards.,btohqsg

"using miles card for day to day products can also be seen as ""buying miles"" in the sense that there is opportunity cost in not getting cashback from cashback cards.eg dcs flex 6% cashack vs 4mpd  you are buying miles at 1.5cpm with the cashback",btohqsg
Abit confused. Whichever the case  I try to keep my spending low  trying to squeeze every mile possible out (legally and within T&C). Even if I dont spend on the UOB KF card  the miles from annual fees are a booster and even if it is one-time only  at least I reduce the cost of a ticket. Sorry if my spending does not align to yours.,btohqsg
Very good point. Which is why I always advocate team value and not be stuck on the mindset thatCashback or miles is better.Go for the higher value option when faced with the merchant mcc.,btohqsg
I mean since on the topic of miles la... But good discussion.,btohqsg
If only MCCs are made well-known to the consumer... sometimes confusing,btohqsg
Can chocolate finance be used to pay for travel insurance and still earn miles?,btohqsg
UOB One vs DCS Flex card  which one is better as a main cashback card? (< 800 min spend),btohqsg
Depends on your spending behaviour and if you need to clock UOB One account spending.,btohqsg

Hi wana check for chocolate debit card if I use it as a giro payment for my insurance. Can I get the miles? Since axs has been banned,btohqsg

Did UOB one reduce the interest rate in Feb? Interested received in March dropped,btohqsg
