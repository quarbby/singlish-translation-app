Anyone happened to have camera footage of Gambas Ave at 1pm today? Someone met with a fatal accident there. The brother of the guy who passed looking for witnesses.,btohqsg
Eh dun say that lea. Wa lao eh.,btohqsg
no. m3 i dont do it myself i have the real old 1990 e30 m40 engine i do it myself. very easy and all manual,btohqsg
this one nobody wants to do outside because they think it is a waste of time. so unloved,btohqsg
but it is the most fun car to drive. feels like a small m3,btohqsg
i can repair this CAR MYSELF . simple things. brake pads change oil  oil bleeding  change etc,btohqsg
You can get a five litres of Motul for your bmw servicing at about 60sgd.,btohqsg
I guess this workshop will not allow u to bring ur own EO,btohqsg
yeah for my bmw i use my own oil castrol edge 0w30,btohqsg
i bought some tools i do this myself  brake,btohqsg
foir the old car  i do DIY  like changing master clutch cylinder.,btohqsg
back breaking work due to constrained space.  the old bmw parts are cheap to buy,btohqsg
You are really a hands-on !,btohqsg
i got no choice. because no workshops like to spend time on old cars.,btohqsg
fortunately it aint hard to do,btohqsg
I am looking for a good service workshop in Johor to service my brother F10.   Any recommendation you have will be good üëç,btohqsg
E30 is still a good car ...,btohqsg
you know many talk about changing brake fluid clutch fluid etc right after so many years etc. not true at all. i do not lose fluids at all nor efficiency. even after 5 years. it is that good dot 4,btohqsg
the master clutch cylinder failed as it is losing pressure not due to leaks but due to rubber seal inside giving way causing no pressure when  you press pedal.,btohqsg
that is why i am keeping. 3 years later becomes classic status,btohqsg
F10 mst be very expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
Yes .... but prepare for leaks ...,btohqsg
leaks is internal; piston seal leaks,btohqsg
and the slave cylinder cosst like $30 only,btohqsg
It get a lot of engine oil leak.... I change the gasket.... ATF.... etc .... endless...,btohqsg
need to get rid of this ride..... spending too much time to maintain it,btohqsg
that is a headache. can be cranksfat side rubber seal leaks there too,btohqsg
haha that is why i never like to drive bmw. expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
that's why the m3 i do it once a week to hear up engine oil and internals only. mistake,btohqsg
what good is a car if expenisve to run,btohqsg
bro  get rid of bmw. serious  get mazda,btohqsg
cheap to run. this should be the way,btohqsg
Define expensive.Why not  if owner is comfortable.Than get one that is suitable for you,btohqsg
i did buy a mazda 6 that i use daily and super happy with it,btohqsg
bmw demands too much of my time to take care,btohqsg
Was interesting in Mazda from the earlier debate.... Getting a car may not be a good idea since COE is too high,btohqsg
Depends on your spending power. Some higher than others so people's comfort level vary greatly.,btohqsg
not just money. with frequent things that need replacement.,btohqsg
on balance  it is not as reliable as japanese,btohqsg
People can afford more time than others too. To be honest there is just too many factors to say what is the best cause every owner  spending power and time to do things to the car  vary.,btohqsg
Which also in the end cost money..,btohqsg
simple repairs i watched youtube to follow,btohqsg
It's always ppl who didn't own a Conti that will make this comment.It's ok  I have ppl in the bike community saying this on Italian bikes too.Anyway  I mean it's good to know how much one can afford too.One thing to share is  there's only problematic owner  nvr the vehicle.,btohqsg
so vehicle is never the problem?,btohqsg
hello. i have alwasy owned continental cars. alfaromeo  bmws  and 2022 a mazda 6,btohqsg
i know more continental cars than many of you who may not own so long,btohqsg
and i can share all these expereinces more than anyone when compared with what i have gone through. every repair and service i have a journal to record eveything,btohqsg
I go your house do tyre rotation,btohqsg
So you spent a fair amount of time at workshop as compared to Jap car?All brand new cars?,btohqsg
3 years leak black oil liao,btohqsg
