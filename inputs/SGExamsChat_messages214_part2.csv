there are people who fly around the world,btohqsg
just to join marathons and runs,btohqsg
To qualify for the track team in NS,btohqsg
Back then I woke up early to run 4-5 times a week,btohqsg
there was this MeiJi run a few yars back  they give everyone 100 dollar if u run below 30,btohqsg
omg i also never i only started like this week,btohqsg
What‚Äôs difficult is actually just getting a fast timing,btohqsg
Because 2.4 is bloody painful to maintain,btohqsg
anyone who can train 2.4 with me,btohqsg
Plus there‚Äôs always the concern that you might get cardiac arrest,btohqsg
i didnt run for 2 years...,btohqsg
Wait but is there a track team in NS though,btohqsg
So they don‚Äôt have to partake in any of the other stuff?,btohqsg
whats this track thing in NS?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs basically like a CCA in NS,btohqsg
i do the frog style leh  very slow pace one,btohqsg
They focus on track and field training,btohqsg
really all dehydrate in like 1 lap,btohqsg
for what like that might as well go fast that way got effect,btohqsg
I only participated in an external race,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs been a very long time,btohqsg
what's your 5 and 10 pbs?,btohqsg
so you more mid distance runner ah?,btohqsg
if u want u can try train longer distances,btohqsg
then got higher chance for army,btohqsg
I mean u won't be in the running team forever,btohqsg
but if u r in  u get to do mostly run training only,btohqsg
but it's only during unit time only,btohqsg
so you still have to do bmt,btohqsg
I can skip the unit training,btohqsg
my teacher went for it after a session cannot even walk,btohqsg
all that leg will give way,btohqsg
a place to look for cats,btohqsg
Most need u to be at least 16  some 18,btohqsg

i will wait for 1-2 year for the market to be very competitive,btohqsg
now like a $10-$20 earpiece will work,btohqsg
when all the phone start going with no earpiece port price will drop^,btohqsg
Every ear piece is almost the same,btohqsg
The function is like wireless and noise cancelling,btohqsg
I would say get a wired one,btohqsg
Anybody know any good computing courses?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm attempting to learn computing over December,btohqsg
ah i got a python thing i got for free,btohqsg
The YouTube ones are all dang difficult to study,btohqsg
Really? I find them more useful than like reading,btohqsg
But I suppose it's all up to preference,btohqsg
Cos like when they actually give you some live examples you see how it's done,btohqsg
Idk I‚Äôbe been finding computing to be quite fascinating lately,btohqsg
But the books are so dry,btohqsg
