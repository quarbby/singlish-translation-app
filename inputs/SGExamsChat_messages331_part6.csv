I was going through with my students in 2020. After a few questions  we gave up on the paper as it was too easy to bother.,btohqsg
I wonder what u think about MI maths,btohqsg
Not sure whats the implication here,btohqsg
As in no point setting easier questions,btohqsg
do you say this because of their strong reputation haha,btohqsg
I cant be bothered by reputation,btohqsg
The scope of work u find in SG,btohqsg
Doesnt really rely on repu that much,btohqsg
Impression so far is ASR set too hard. EJ set too easy.,btohqsg
U grad SMU Nus or SIT in the end if u have decent experience and portfolio,btohqsg
ucla is not considered that impressive,btohqsg
anws the idea I think is,btohqsg
Local uni is more or less same for local CS jobs,btohqsg
But why i said NUS is because eaiser to build the abovementioned,btohqsg
If yall want oversea CS jobs there is where the inequality will come in,btohqsg
Esp if ure soemone who is getting into it,btohqsg
And something that is not necessarily ur passion,btohqsg
Unless ur one of those w github and medium articles on deep learning,btohqsg
Then i dont think ud be asking this ques,btohqsg
I think it really depends on your aims and your financial needs. I recommend you to talk to seniors and look at LinkedIn as well - while there's no CS graduating batch you can look at whether SMU IS ppl managed to snag the positions you're aiming for,btohqsg
cannot underestimate starting without 40k debt,btohqsg
Reminds me of an old friend,btohqsg
But yeah I think smu and nus are similar enough you need to decide by a) cost b) environment  not so much perceived pwesteege and recognition,btohqsg
Who went UCLA to study cs,btohqsg
I went for scholarship interview before with MNC  and actually asked the head of HR opinion on why not offer for overseas.They tell me if they are looking at overseas grad  they would likely open the company there and not SG.,btohqsg
this MNC only offer local scholarships for NUS and NTU back then,btohqsg
Yes those who r good enough will just go overseas for better opp,btohqsg
A lot of our foriegn nurses just opt to going US where there is higher demand pay and opp,btohqsg
costs. A friend when LSE on MAS scholarship. But London just too expensive  so still need to fork out some more,btohqsg
shag how can they not fully cover,btohqsg
they cover basic expenses. If want a bit more then not enough lor,btohqsg
many of these overseas scholarships are in the tune of quarter million,btohqsg
Ull have to compare costs of living and other things alsl,btohqsg
my us sch all in 500k,btohqsg
my info is already 20 years ago ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I not sure i havnt been in contact w her for 3 yrs now,btohqsg
I went to Google for it ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but I don't get what has that got to do with PSC scholarship,btohqsg
I (and a lot of ppl i guess) dw the bond,btohqsg
i thought fr psc scholarship you need to serve,btohqsg
but I grad in 2008 financial crisis.The bond ensured I got a job immediately,btohqsg
if someone good enough to get satki bonded scholarship,btohqsg
Maybe i should just take the sponsorship that i was offered,btohqsg
odds are they can secure an intern conversion,btohqsg
ya  but starting with no debt gives u peace of mind,btohqsg
If it comes at an expense of mental stressors from the bonds,btohqsg
U can get out of 40k perhaps,btohqsg
Any new company u start work with  likely u are staying for at least 3 years,btohqsg
jumping every year is generally frowned upon by HR.,btohqsg
better school with lower cop = you allow yourself to stretch further = allow yourself to do well / better?,btohqsg
