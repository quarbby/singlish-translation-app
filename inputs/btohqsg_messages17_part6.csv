Hi  I have applied for Sep 22 BTO  Nov 22 BTO and keen to apply with this upcoming May exercise. We thought that we stood no chance for our late queue  and am getting ready apply for the May exercise. Recently though  we got our flat selection appointment date for our Sep selection. I am wondering:1. Is it possible for me to reschedule our flat selection during the May application period  so we can reject the flat selection while we apply for May?2. Would rejecting the flat selection for Sep 22 effect my eligibility for Nov 22 queue?,btohqsg
1. if u reschedule your flat selection  other ppl will select before u even tho u have a better number. But seeing as how it‚Äôs already pretty late into the sept bto selection  i‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre left with lower floors? u can reject the sept bto instead if u don‚Äôt want the lower floors2. is it your first time rejecting? if yes  it not will affect your may bto. if no  it will affect your may bto. Nov bto is not affected,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply! May I know whats the procedure to reschedule the flat selection appointment?,btohqsg

Hi  I have a flat booking appointment for next week. However I am unable to go due to covid complications. I know there is an option to authorize someone else  but it isn't very convenient in my current case. Are there any options to reschedule the options? I couldn't see that as an options in my HDB portal. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
U have to authorize someone if u can't make it. Print the Authorizion letter from hdb and fill it up,btohqsg

https://mustsharenews.com/alexandra-post-office/?utm_source=telegramalexandra bto coming up if y‚Äôall are interested,btohqsg
SW  don‚Äôt think can check availability of units left from btohq website  only from hdb flat portal,btohqsg
HDB | Flat Supply & Applications Receivedhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/BP13J011SBFNov22.jsp,btohqsg
That's why it boggles me why the govt can't build ahead of demand instead of bto system now.They can even build in advance like 5k or 10k flats  very fast snapped up. Even for sbf there's like almost 20k applicants,btohqsg
