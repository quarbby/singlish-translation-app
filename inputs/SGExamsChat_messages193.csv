and luckily its a wired earpeice,btohqsg
also  i think he can use the argyment  if i want to cheat why will i go toliet with the earpeice in my pocket for u to find it 😂,btohqsg
Maybe he wanted to listen to it in the toilet,btohqsg
plug the earpiece into the toilet,btohqsg
Yoo one time i brought in earpiece too just forgot i had it in my pocket the whole time,btohqsg
later u get 0 point like the xavier ong,btohqsg
xavier ong is on another lvl,btohqsg
i think many would dream of being one,btohqsg
I once brought in a whole mcdonalds happy meal in my pocket,btohqsg
And then here's all of us bitching about our papers,btohqsg
We need to learn from Xavier Ong,btohqsg
xavier ong father is a famous actor mah,btohqsg
My friend brought his physics practice paper into the physics exam,btohqsg

It was left under the table and he forgot to bring it out,btohqsg
My friend brought a cambridge examiner into the exam,btohqsg
I brought in a cheat sheet into the exam and revised it and left the cheat sheet in my bag,btohqsg
so cambridge examiner did the paper for him,btohqsg
that time dono who brought the nerf gun into the exam venue  after that confiscated n kenna scolded,btohqsg
He's ready to shoot down the examiners haha,btohqsg
Bro if i was him i Wont accept this ah,btohqsg
wait who why the hell did he bring a  nerf guns into exam venue,btohqsg
No way my marks terminate bcos of earphone,btohqsg
If no device how to use lol,btohqsg
cambridge will be fair although its considered that he broke protocol,btohqsg
They rlly gotta change the rule for that,btohqsg
I once brought a computer into exam hall,btohqsg
but luckily i just played Agario with it,btohqsg
so I got a pass from cambridge,btohqsg
True story : i once brought my phone and Pc Set Up,btohqsg

At leastnever get heart attack xd,btohqsg
hello did yall dr s yin or j yin,btohqsg
but i know the credit became debit,btohqsg
What is ur discount allowed amount??,btohqsg
Then cash in hand is 1455,btohqsg
But it says incorrectly credited to J Yin. So in order to remove the wrong amt fr J Yin you must debit J yin to zerorise it,btohqsg
So dr J yin cr s yin,btohqsg
no idea how to do the explanation part for the errors i didn't study tat,btohqsg
TR xscuer add up should be 1500,btohqsg
but its a tr right no?,btohqsg
J yin if im not wrong have to debit,btohqsg
Cuz j yin didn't owe u anything so need add back TR,btohqsg
if its a tr then to zeroise j yin shdnt u credit j yin,btohqsg
Its a payment  so supposedly need minus TR from S yin,btohqsg
i write tr xavier as other receivable,btohqsg
wah i die for the income statement,btohqsg
Nvm whats 2 mark in 35 marks,btohqsg
u r not wrong. but it says incorrectly credited so u have to do the opposite,btohqsg
But they owe u lesser  so need minus,btohqsg
so u need to plus back the wrong amt in j yin's acc bcos they accidentally minus off,btohqsg
first qn can write TR - Xavier as OR - Xavier ? they nvr state what he bought,btohqsg
Idk  I anyhow explain then give examples,btohqsg
I tot all figures are given??,btohqsg
then how to calculate 2 unknowns,btohqsg
principle : wrong account of diff classcompensating : overstate or understatedcomplete reversal: posted to wrong nature (dr/cr),btohqsg
Can put diff group? Cuz I forgot the term “diff class”,btohqsg
But they give so many lines....,btohqsg
Which theory did y'all put for the last qn?,btohqsg
actually i anyhow write one cos i dont remember anything,btohqsg
HAHAH dh such thing thats an accounting role,btohqsg
ya bc it’s under professional ethics,btohqsg
Why monetary? I didn't understand the qn,btohqsg
Cuz reputation cannot be recorded in biz transactions,btohqsg
bcos only can use source document as evidence to prepare financial statements as it contains unbiased facts,btohqsg
shd be only recorded in terms of money value only,btohqsg
Reputation/loyalty etc all cannot be recorded,btohqsg
hi is reading prelim math solutions enough for h2 math,btohqsg
U also need to understand their thinking process too,btohqsg
For complete reversal I just put posted on the wrong side of the transaction in the journal entry,btohqsg
My school notes say wrong side of the transaction...,btohqsg
maybe got range of answera ba,btohqsg
Wrong side wrong nature same thing in the journal anyways,btohqsg
Do u have long - term borrowing? Cuz I transferred everything to current portion 😰,btohqsg
Literature and F and N still have even more papers next week,btohqsg
Gonna spend the whole weekend grinding again,btohqsg
no idea how to study chi lmao,btohqsg
btw did anyone who took pure history p1 realise that the 2b malaya qn was fundamentally wrong bc malaya's social impact doesn't talk about western education but education in general only,btohqsg
creation of western-educated elites is only in Indonesia,btohqsg
and somehow that became the reason for malaya?,btohqsg
But indo was colonised by Dutch,btohqsg
Sorry i grad like 5yrs ago,btohqsg
So my content a bit blurred,btohqsg
Im ancient  according to some people,btohqsg
for malaya only talks abt social divide due to limited access to education which includes chinese education &indian education  and does not relate to western education in anyway or rather not in specificity to that,btohqsg
According to some of my friend they wrote pangkor treaty,btohqsg
so im just v confused rn😔,btohqsg
Sorry i didn't know much abt bk 1,btohqsg
Out of the 9 chpts we are suppose to study,btohqsg
I gamble my way i studied 4 chpt,btohqsg
Out of the 4 chpt 2 of them came out which is stalin and hitler,btohqsg
man idk wth is seab tryna fo,btohqsg
Is time for you to find one :),btohqsg
Yo same bro i also got f&n paper,btohqsg
yea but there's more than one,btohqsg
Ye i wrote about chinese/indians too,btohqsg
like includes chinese education as well,btohqsg
This is my answer my teacher vetted it and said it looks good,btohqsg
bc that's the exact same phrasing for the impact in indo,btohqsg
Ya. Quite a few western think they are the best,btohqsg
My ans for 2a is political (maintain prestige over other european powers economic (need for ... and desire of businessmen - emphasis on larut wars and succession dispute  1865 1000 gheehins fled to penang which was british territory-affected economic interests  because 2a said 1874 so you need to link to pangkor treaty) + suez canal2b not the main factor. Plural society (factions  malay reservation system  jealousy  malays became minorities in some states) creation western ed elites (chi philantrophists  malay royal family receive ed from british  indian plantation owners did not care about education for their children  western ed elites segregated from masses) conclusion plural society> west ed elites because it affected the masses and created a more polarised society,btohqsg
oooo nice ur ans looks good,btohqsg
I scribbledit down on last 2 min instead of doing another para for sbq,btohqsg
the sbq was hard to understand when u first look at it man,btohqsg
1a my attitude was distrustful attitude eg ukraine great famine1b similar in terms of stalin's policy genuinely wanting to create social cohesion1c D prove E contentDoes not prove purposePurpose D: glorify stalin's positive treatment of ethnic minorities. Eg great terror he eliminated many ethnic minotirites ukrainians impact: gain support   increased political stabilitySource E was sent to Stalin because NKVD under stalin  no hidden agenda  probbably true that the ethnic minorities were treated badly. E more reliable than D hence d does not prove e lying1d. Not surprised: need to gain support to rise to powerSurprised: hindsight (events in 1930s) contradict1e. A&E support B&F do not support,btohqsg
my teacher said its okay too except 1b cause i only did 1 para so l2/3-4,btohqsg
ya tbh it was rly q confusing and everything and not sure if the same impacts will occur in both societies,btohqsg
btw for source f the ans was in a part of the tb that nobody read,btohqsg
f? my friends write abt how stalin actl didnt like the idea of communism,btohqsg
or u could also write about how revolution just happened afew years ago and therefore possible for the ppl to feel united as they supported communism,btohqsg
cool i thought it was only my sch,btohqsg
i think quite afew schools haha,btohqsg
You do 3 sbq alrd ah,btohqsg

Does anyone know if the ntuc share a textbook allow TYS? From what I know now they allow accept Textbook ? And I want to get rid of my tys and I got from 2002 tys till 2019 for N levels O levels and A levels ;-;,btohqsg
I believe there is a cap on how old a JC student can be,btohqsg
U mean like a maximum age requirement?,btohqsg
Cause you take As as private why go jc haha,btohqsg
Btw..is it possible to get A1 for pure chemistry?,btohqsg
Heard that those students who are very good in chem tends to only achieve A2.,btohqsg
Why go poly then take private a level,btohqsg
No one in singapore can get a1,btohqsg
Is there like a certain demand to get A1?,btohqsg
Just that it’s much harder than A2,btohqsg
I think the difference in score between A1 and A2 is like the difference in score between B4 and A2,btohqsg
how will it be impossible tho..,btohqsg
I got A1 for pure chem last year,btohqsg
my dear friend just wanted some validation man,btohqsg
I got like 87 for Average.In case u wanna know,btohqsg
when there's alot of uncertainties people tend to speculate and brood over whether they are able to do so,btohqsg
or just overall just doubting themselves,btohqsg
i mean im not going to get that lol 🥺,btohqsg
what sets aside the A1s from thr A2s is the juice in their blood,btohqsg
humour? Its just me saying juice,btohqsg
IIRC if it’s untouched we put them in last year :)But based on my two years experience they had diff standard cos diff ppl in charge so idk bout this yr,btohqsg
Could somebody please explain to my poor untalented brain,btohqsg
How this whole moderation system works?,btohqsg
if one yr students generally did badly for a qn,btohqsg
Moderation is based on difficulty of paper. If a particular question has a lot of ppl doing poorly for it. That ques will be marked leniently or the grade required to get a grade for that paper will be adjusted by a mark or two,btohqsg
Then it will hold lesser marks,btohqsg
i mean still v hard for me even with moderation,btohqsg
I’m hoping the moderation for humanities this year will be low,btohqsg
I still have MT next week,btohqsg
nooo i just wanted to say so that if the person sees this  he or she wont think i copy or wtv,btohqsg
same no idea how to study (can i don't haha),btohqsg
So they just told me to take it in nov,btohqsg
btw does anyone know how to do better for chinese compre so i think this qn q stupid but yea,btohqsg
I didn’t study for mother tongue at all in June,btohqsg
And still performed better at o levels,btohqsg
cher say standard good then can score well just dont crack under pressure,btohqsg
Than I ever did in school,btohqsg
I am an F9 student so,btohqsg
So you calculated and estimated the score after u were done with all chem papers?,btohqsg
i got a2 for chi in june and i think it's bc of my compre tbh,btohqsg
Lol then u get your answers from those tutors who sit for the paper?,btohqsg
Just find common words and just copy from passage only HAHA,btohqsg
That's what my friend did he got B3 for doing thsy,btohqsg
ya sometimes u write exactly they minus ur marks,btohqsg
Then don't over write I guess,btohqsg
theres five steps to tackle chinese compre,btohqsg
if the ans is in a certain para  u copy the whole para  they at most minus 1 mark oni if u got include all the points,btohqsg
"I see that there's people on reddit who has this blue ""valued contributor"" flair  what's the criteria to get it? I'm definitely not eligible since im just a lurker but im just wondering",btohqsg

I predict mcq gonna be very hard,btohqsg
Paper 2 was very hard already,btohqsg
A1 is humanely impossible after practical,btohqsg
Maybe cos i panicked and started doubting myself but its hard,btohqsg
When i did the paper i was super chill,btohqsg
I feel like I fail as a person,btohqsg
Which means bye i wont see u in np,btohqsg

Thanks for even bothering to reply me,btohqsg
