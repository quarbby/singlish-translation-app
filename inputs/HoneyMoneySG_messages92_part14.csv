Still within free-look period? If yes  suggest to cancel first.,btohqsg
If u are using endowus... Suggest u compare with amundi fund ... Compare the fund mgmt fees that u are paying,btohqsg
Ohh seems like they’re investing in the same funds but different holding %. Though the fees are a lot lower,btohqsg
Yea .... Fees eat into your profits,btohqsg
UOB EVOL reset based on calendar month?,btohqsg
Hi all  for CRMC  is it i sum up all my transactions for that statement month and x10? Need to round off the final value or anything? I am not able to tally the points,btohqsg
Any hacks to save on fees ?,btohqsg
Different way to calculate  for individual transactions  round down to nearest dollar & sum all up. Then X10,btohqsg
Anyone still not getting the uob fresh fund reward? Transfer out on the 30/12. And transfer in on 1/1. I have filled the form and maintain the required amount. Still not getting it? Anything i did wrong?,btohqsg
They still have 5 more days to do so..,btohqsg
Received a msg saying my account has not been funded with the participating amount. Called the hotline and mentioned i have properly done and just wait. Got really confused.,btohqsg
What time did you transfer out,btohqsg
If i failed. Can i redo it by transferring out on 28/2 and transfer in on 1/3?,btohqsg
What time. Or easier  what does it say on your app? Transferred on 2 Jan or 30 Dec?,btohqsg
What if my order is less than $1? Then no points😂,btohqsg
So how much % cash back would this promo rate be then?,btohqsg
10/280 = up to 3.57%  not including another 1% from hsbc ega everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Got it thank you. That is tempting given my primary miles pool is in UOB and HSBC has a chance of being orphaned. Thank you@trazora,btohqsg
Hi all. Trying to count my MAB. Not sure why ocbc bonus interest is not tally. Wondering is my MAB is wrong or?,btohqsg

Planning to buy gold bar in msia mcc 5944 around 2k sgd equivalent. Best way is amaze+ uob kf? I don't have uob kf yet but if Best way is this then I'll sign up for it (im aware of the 800 min spend in sq products) . And I try not to apply cards with risk of orphan miles,btohqsg
the bullion shop never charge credit card fee?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.aiCombination of PPV and VS work for you since both pool the miles?,btohqsg
Foreign spend. Visa card would need bank fcy fee. I'd prefer if can amazed it,btohqsg
?? Why buy gold at Malaysia,btohqsg
Assuming the difference is 1% between with n without amaze  you earn 2000 miles more by paying S$20.value of miles = $20/2000 = 1 cpm. From here you can make your own decision.,btohqsg
If we pay via Atome (3 mths instalment) for retail shopping  does the payment still counted towards credit card eligible spend and/or entitle cash back? E.g. Stanchart Simply Cash cc.,btohqsg

I have not looked at sc cards but i use it to pay with hsbc revo,btohqsg
Even if cheaper. At most 0.x% maybe. Cuz gold price is quite standard. Physical gold definitely have some form of mark up. Just buy from Singapore BullionStar or what shld be OK alr.,btohqsg
May I know which platform is good for investment for low trading fee?,btohqsg
u know how ocbc bonus interest is calculated? only 2% p.a. for salary  1.2% p.a. for save  0.6% p.a. for spend if balance is below $75k. E.g. for 2% p.a. interest in Jan is= 31/366×2%×7525.81= $12.75 only,btohqsg
Yeah. I forgot to divide 365 * total days of the month,btohqsg
