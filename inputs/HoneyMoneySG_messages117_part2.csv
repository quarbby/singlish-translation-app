So 3.2 MPD how that convert after to pool it to SIA ? maybe the conversion rate will be low ü§î anyone has used it before ?,btohqsg
I think you should do some reading up on the card,btohqsg
The rate is already as stated by mabybank lol. 3.2 mpd keep as maybank treat point. Minimum 10k krisflyer miles to convert,btohqsg

Asking for advice  Whts the best way to remit sgd to myr for large sums? Thanks.,btohqsg
I'm trying to think of a simple credit card strategy for my wife  who's not the type to maximize rewards.Her spend is a lot of Grab rides  and the rest a mixed bag - online shopping  physical store shopping  some meals  occassional manicure etc.Any advice on whether this would generally work (other than a general use card)a. Use UOB ONE for all Grab ridesb. UOB VS for contactless  between $1K to $2K (accept occasional UOB merchant and $5 block issue)c. CRMC for all online spend  up to $1K,btohqsg
Cimb sg to cimb my  or maybank sg to maybank my  same bank is faster and less fee,btohqsg
Can try dbs remit or wise,btohqsg
Thanks and agreed its faster but the rates not competitive at times. :),btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is any metapay fraud on CRMC happening? I just received a charge and reversal on metapay that I don‚Äôt recall using any metapay before.,btohqsg
Thanks  but fees quite high for wise...,btohqsg
Ongoing issue with all banks and cards.It‚Äôs kind of random so no matter what u do it‚Äôs unavoidable. Unless u prepared to lock your cards all the time.,btohqsg
U will get flag either way if u transfering big amt  so bank is a better option in such case,btohqsg
Feel like not much use  as many people kena fraud charges even tho locked,btohqsg
My citi rewards card totally never use at all but kena fraud,btohqsg
Sorry  when you say flag  in what sense? as the fees?,btohqsg
Very common  lost count how many time i replace citi card already,btohqsg
When u remit over a certain amount often u have to explain if to third party. Unless is own bank sg to own bank my,btohqsg
I see  Surely for an legit purpose. Trying to see if there are better established ways or better fx rates available other than banks such as Wise or Panda remit.,btohqsg
Wise also will get stop at time over a certain amt,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. There is an limit for each service which needs to take note as well.,btohqsg
Got 3 of such last night. From Japan and Brazil. Raise dispute and new card on the way.,btohqsg
What are the whitelist MCC for HSBC,btohqsg
And when is HSBC revolution changes start,btohqsg
Wow  credit card fraud is commonüò±. Thank you for sharing.,btohqsg
This may be the End for HSBC Revolutionhttps://youtu.be/GwQPxTQw8yU,btohqsg
Anybody tried ocbc Paynow from another bank ?,btohqsg
Is there a way to check if I met the conditions of sign-on bonuses? (standard chartered simply cash credit card),btohqsg
Banks apply offline. Will be permanently until you cancel GIRO arrangement (another hassle  it took me 3 CSOs to find out the full GIRO details before you can submit through their online signing document - which most CSOs will not provide the correct link on first try - thanks outsourced CSOs without proper training),btohqsg
That‚Äôs scary! I pray my DBS cards are safe! Each DBS is GIRO to each of my EGA. üò≠üò∞Cannot imagine having to re-do all that!,btohqsg
That's not Apple Pay  but direct CC payment,btohqsg
Based on experience  haven't gotten any instance of fraudulent transactions on my DBS cards.,btohqsg
Be careful what u wish for üòè,btohqsg
My mind is blown apart alr üòÇ,btohqsg
I got it on my DBS WWMC last year üòÇ9 million viet dong dong chiang üòµüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
I change my card due to fraud. Do I need to redo my giro to hsbc ega?,btohqsg
After setup successfully  would be also good to cancel the GIRO arrangement with UOB.As usual  it takes about 3 working weeks to setup  so unless you are sure it's already changed  don't cancel the old arrangement.,btohqsg
I saw the 19 000 000 pop up on my ApplePay notifications I chuat sai üí©,btohqsg
Or you can just add in and save it as default on fairprice app. Don't waste the free 1k local transaction.,btohqsg
Can just be a transfer from different name.,btohqsg
All the points cns be access through yuu app. Remember to scan your yuu QR first before making payment so you get all the yuu points.,btohqsg
Sounds ok. If card limits reached ($2K + $1K) can consider adding UOB PPV or DBS WWMC.,btohqsg
Depends on the t&c. Best to check before spending.,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of spend and how you pay (online/contactless)  there are some alternatee. Crmc with amaze is the most notable one.,btohqsg
Usually dont have to  bank will reset up giro on the replacement card but u might miss 1 statement and need to manual pay,btohqsg
Why this message like familiar ah? ü§£,btohqsg
Interbank GIRO will auto? They so nice inform the debiting bank on the changes? ü§£,btohqsg
If Amaze is linked to CRMCAnd if i add Amaze into google wallet/google pay  its gonna work the same as though i had the physical card right?,btohqsg
Yes. I added mine to google pay and used per normal.,btohqsg
