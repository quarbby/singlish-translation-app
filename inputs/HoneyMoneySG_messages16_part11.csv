hi! i just got my CRMC and set up instarem amaze on my iphone. do i have to wait for the physical card since im not able to add the virtual card to my wallet?,btohqsg
You can use for online purchases,btohqsg
for online purchases  since CRMC is already eligible  should i still use instarem or just use CRMC directly?,btohqsg
i mainly purchase from shopee as well since 11/11 is coming soon too haha,btohqsg
Better exchange rate for foreign currencies,btohqsg
i guess it's similar to what Haroon was saying  if i purchase from foreign merchants like taobao then it's better to use instarem card instead,btohqsg
If shop in Shopee MY  then Amaze card better then bank rate. But transferring from CIMB SG to CIMB MY gets better rate then Amaze if have account in both countries.,btohqsg

Anybody knows how did the latest TBill 6mth get allocated? Applied for 5k using cash  got allocated 2k only..,btohqsg
That mean it is oversubcribe so it is prorate allocated,btohqsg
Yea I know that  but how did 5k get u 2k? Another friend applied 1k using srs and got 0,btohqsg
I'm guessing you did non-competitive and got a prorated allotment owing to non-competitive bids being > 40% of issue size  while your friend either(1) did non-competitive also but got 0 because after proration  the amount is less than the minimum issuance amount / denomination or(2) the bid yield for competitive issuance was higher than 4.00%  resulting in no allotment,btohqsg
Thanks! I understand now. The minimum denomination of tbill is 1k.,btohqsg
