Boss. I havent gotten master degree yet. Im thinking more of language course ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
hi does anyone know which cc i shld use to get tax refunds for overseas purchases,btohqsg
i just know dont use anything with miles all that cos the refund will take away ur miles and cashback  maybe use debit card or something which have no rewards?,btohqsg
Did uob closed the self credit salary loophole? For UOB one account?,btohqsg
At least I haven't seen any reports of that yet. Got 1 case in another group but questionable.,btohqsg
Uob told me can't self credit,btohqsg
Not sure of your exact question. So far  I had not encountered any cards that do not qualify for tax refunds. If your concern is regarding which card processes the refunds fastest  then avoid using Amex. Otherwise  itâ€™s a balance of fcy  miles and Cashback  whichever suits you.,btohqsg
That may be some new development. As of sep  it still works.,btohqsg
Mine is self credit  alot have already advice dont go ask cso regarding such thing as it is obviously in their tnc. The more u ask the faster loop get closed. My screenshot already show u it move the tracker,btohqsg
"I have a feeling some people every month will ask cso if the ""hack"" still works. ðŸ˜…",btohqsg
Some ppl no common sense one. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It is a hack and you ask CSO. What do you expect them to say? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It will be better for them to ask the security guard where are the loop hole to access the bank vault instead of salary transfer. ðŸ™„,btohqsg
Just try it yourself and then see if it works using the app after 2 to 3 days? What is so difficult?,btohqsg
I think he/she got the idea. Anyway  if you feel uob one way isnt suitable/scared loophole being closed  there are other banks' saving account. Don't need to lose sleep over it.,btohqsg
Sometime people dont like to try  they like to be spoonfeed. That is why some lead the herd while some is in the herd. No right or wrong.,btohqsg
also have those call the wolf to come eat the sheep,btohqsg
That why people have to keep learning new thing to prevent becoming prey mah. Be the predator instead of the prey or at least be able to fend off predator,btohqsg
The mindset if i cant have it  so cant you.,btohqsg
In order to receive something u need to give something. Energy trade is always equal,btohqsg

Hi MtSorry to be asking you on another topicFor klook  I am paying about $400 total for USS SG Tickets  does anyone know any promo code I can use?I am going to use klook credits If using all credits  definitely can't apply any promo code?If using partial  it will let me apply discount code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Can I check anyone of you get a financial advisor to manage your finances on a holistic basis ? If yes why and if no  why not ? Thanks.,btohqsg
do you mean:1. insurance agent?2. bank RM?,btohqsg
USS Singapore is typically excluded from all specials discounts / codes. You should try to see if any credit card is running promos. Last time Maybank used to have special prices. Else you can consider buying Gift Cards (Heymax? Shopback) then buy the USS ticket (please check if USS tickets can be bought with Gift Cards),btohqsg
1. insurance agent should only be used for insurance  ideally only term insurance. Do not let insurance agents handle investments for which I feel they are not qualified or dedicated enough.2. Bank RM you can get some input/feedback from them but do your own further research / due diligence before doing the trade with Bank RM. Obviously a public chat like HERE would NOT be a good place for any investment advice  maybe just general.,btohqsg
I don't know your size but this is general ccomment.i would actually suggest a #3.Do a simple DCA approach yourself if you are still building up your size. It can be a simple purchase of Index ETF (e.g. S&P 500) or a few solid blue chip stocks. Once you have sufficient size  try to get yourself to at least Priority Banking and above so you have access to more investment products. Always keep to simple vanilla products and avoid complicated structures.,btohqsg
ThanksYes I've been searching but not applicable to USS.I'm going to buy with all klook gift card  so was thinking if any platform code I can apply before I go aheadThank you!,btohqsg
once you apply klook gift card  only the BALANCE amount can be entitled to promo code use.The entire purchase will not qualify for Heymax or Shopback anymore.,btohqsg

Is it just me or dbs using ai to approve cc applications? My experience  usually at least a day to get approved. On the other hand  dbs takes less than 5mins.,btohqsg
Does the YU card need to be contactless payment or can be physical ? Or both also OK ? Anybody knows ?,btohqsg
Hahha depends on what you count as AI. It's complicated decision making tree with lots of rules for these cc applications.,btohqsg
So where/when human comes into this process? Just for education purposes,btohqsg

At any point  the system can flag for anything suspicious and human banker will have to look into it.,btohqsg
Can put into some no frills saving bank account.,btohqsg

Tbh invest in yourself. Invest in extra skills. That I'll be doing if i were to start over. Cuz with all these skills  you can leverage for better income  hence moe moneeeyyyyy,btohqsg
