Hi all  need advise on which credit card(s) is best for big ticket purchases for wedding  renovation  home appliances  furniture.Notable MCCs: 5944  5262  5311  5732  5712  7399  1750  7273  5697  5699  5521  5812  7011,btohqsg
Hi all shifu  may I ask  I’m currently using uob one account. I’m going to switch over to ocbc 360.May I ask  if there’s any rewards for opening ocbc 360 account via singsaver etc?,btohqsg
Is there some issues with chocolate finance today?,btohqsg
No issue for me as well.,btohqsg
Have you try to find the answers fromhttps://heymax.ai/first before asking here?,btohqsg
Yes I did but I realised not very accurate. I entered the merchants and the top recommended credit cards are like ocbc frank  uob evol  hsbc revolution(nerfed to online spend only  but not updated in heymax). The cashback/miles on these cards are limited. So want to find out any better cards to use for big ticket purchases,btohqsg
Good to hear that. Another suggestion is try to search in the chat history. Hope that be someone who can advise you on this.,btohqsg

Hi. Does anyone experience an overcharge when paying using cc onbooking.com? Booking.cok quote $511.94 for my hotel stay but i was charged $517.05 as reflected on uob app.,btohqsg
1% DCC for SGD payment processed overseas,btohqsg
Ohh okay thanks for the info,btohqsg
Yes normal. They say charge due to foreign payment or something like that. Agoda also like that. For Agoda if you pay now then won’t have such issue. If you select pay later  they will have many pattern come out,btohqsg
hi gurus.. question  I am paying agoda hotel side  they havent charge me yet till the day i stay or I can pay before staying  not sure if is considered as a oversea spending if I ask the hotel side to charge me as the country's currency via my citi premier miles (after 12 sep)?,btohqsg
What does it say in ur Agoda app? Pay now or pay at hotel?,btohqsg
Payment collected by property at any time,btohqsg
Hi guys for those using citibank rewards with amaze  do you track your spending for the month via instarem app or the citibank app? To make sure the 1k is capped.,btohqsg
Can try emailing the hotel. Should be foreign currency but they want accommodate ur date anot  it's up to the hotel,btohqsg
For the cap  I tracked using city app. As long as the points earned less than 10k then Im good.,btohqsg
need to check your citi statement also.. mine charges every 20th of the mth and amaze reset their statement every 1st of the mth,btohqsg
So we follow citibank statement right? Which means we check the app how much was charged right?Also for those who uses Google play store  do we need to select amaze card when making payment to get the 10x or choosing the normal citi rewards also ok?,btohqsg
Hi want to confirm does groceries fall under shopping for the new hsbc live+ card? Like ntuc,btohqsg
Nope  groceries not counted under shopping,btohqsg
Ah dang. Ok probably not worth it to swap from uob one account and evol combo then.,btohqsg
Hi I just signed up the UOB lady card and choose fashion as the category.i spent some money at Adidas but did not receive 5x uni$. Just to check the bonus uni$ will come together or collate and credit on another date?,btohqsg
collate and credit at the start/end of the month,btohqsg
Why stick to Evol even after nerf?,btohqsg
Would anyone know if HSBC Live+ min monthly spend is based on posting date or transaction date?,btohqsg
I don’t do miles since don’t foresee myself travelling with v young kids.Cash back wise is there sth better? My spending is mostly grocery and online shopping,btohqsg
Even though it’s been nerfed but the one account interest rate still gives 3% with min spend met,btohqsg
Try using the Citi PremierMiles special Agoda landing page for 5mpd. Compare the prices with your current offer.https://www.agoda.com/en-gb/bonusmiles,btohqsg
I think you can still go ahead with Live+. Put your shopping and dining spend primarily on that card. UOB One you can then use to fully optimise on grocery spend (shopee  cold storage),btohqsg
Not confident to hit $600 for 3 consec months without groceries spend. I hardly dine outside,btohqsg
man. i didnt know got this.. already book and can't cancel,btohqsg
Oh so shopee falls under groceries? How do you guys see which code it falls under,btohqsg
Shopee codes under multiple mccs. Hence you might wanna put more Shopee spend under your UOB one card since it gives blanket cashback,btohqsg
I don’t have one card  using evol instead  once hit the min spend I switch to Citi cash back+,btohqsg
But thanks for explaining at least now I know live+ def won’t work for me,btohqsg
I tracked using Instarem to make sure I don’t hit over 1k lest they charge 1% for excess.,btohqsg
Suggest you get One to replace your Evol then to meet your UOB one account min spend and get cashback simultaneously,btohqsg
Why leh? Evol contributes to uob one account min spend as well? And cash back amt is still higher post nerf,btohqsg
If you've done the math and find it higher then go ahead and keep it  no worries,btohqsg
