I would say if u do ft,btohqsg
Ur not gg to get such good income most days,btohqsg
Unless festive season or heavy heavy rain,btohqsg
you can join my amazon flex group to ask the members there,btohqsg
not sure if i can post any links here  scared tio ban üôà,btohqsg
Now heavy rain also must see LLM mood. üòÇ End up only the vendors up tips or you risk taking rescue orders from Oddle,btohqsg
just in case anyone decides to join amazon flex... just to let you know first hor... amazon is a bigger bitch than LLM,btohqsg
(but earnings are usually better than LLM),btohqsg
40mins from jurong west to harbourfront then to whampoa?,btohqsg
Yah. As in he left jurong west at 7pm to drop at harbourfront then pickup the whampoa order at 740pm?,btohqsg
That is abit near impossible cos of traffic and time to park n drop etc,btohqsg
That will depend on price and time üòÇ,btohqsg
If it's very late and no other jobs n the job go towards my home and price very good then I'll takeüòÇ,btohqsg
But I doubt 40mins can do the above jw - harbourfront - whampoa,btohqsg

you just need an asshole of a customer to complain about you once and twice and YOU'RE OUT,btohqsg

Hi morning  my 1st time doing early morning. Question is the ERP we have to pay ourself or charge customer?,btohqsg
Pay yourself. Might want to communicate with the sender first. Otherwise try and take the non-ERP route.,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't like your flooding.Asiahas been temporarily muted for 1 hour.,btohqsg
Fren dun agure with him. Even if u could done this amount. Dun need to envy him.this kind of distance he is earning less than $10 per hrs after his petrol,btohqsg
If rental car more jialet. If own car than TC. High maintenance,btohqsg
Lol I think for those who really count the distance and hrs the earning after llm commission will make new driver wake up the idea,btohqsg
He is earning a 250 netts . Make it simple and easy. He top up $70 petrol every day and car park?? ERP?? I dun think he will go that fast during peak hrs without goin though any ERP,btohqsg
He is making $150 after everything's that is deducted fren,btohqsg
New drivers u all think it's worth the money and effort?,btohqsg
And driving on the road for long hrs is not worth it,btohqsg
Not only heath is that one accident only the whole month earning will be wasted,btohqsg
I used to drive 2.4 full time last time. And the most I do is 8 hrs per day,btohqsg
If I will to do 15hrs I rather wrk for a company that cover mine insurance,btohqsg
