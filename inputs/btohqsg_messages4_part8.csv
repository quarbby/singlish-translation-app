Yes I understand need to have at least 5% cash downpayment,btohqsg
Tried calling in today but keen cut my line due to nobody answer,btohqsg
Ok i try to call the officer again tomorrow then,btohqsg
Cash down payment is up to 20% right,btohqsg
I chose my unit in year 2017  decided on HDB loan then. My expected key collection is 3Q2021. I informed HDB that I‚Äôm going to change to bank loan in March 2021 but maybe can inform earlier so to avoid delay in collecting keys.,btohqsg
Yup over. But probably I should have done it maybe early jan or last year.,btohqsg
The switch causing delay in collecting keys?,btohqsg
Not sure. Some ppl said it will take months to settle a bank loan. Though mine seems to be accepted by bank within a month. But to be safe  maybe can do earlier.,btohqsg
Hi.. just a random question.. Any idea if let's say a divorcee below 35  can apply for bto or resales?,btohqsg
Then you have to pay 5% with cash. Then rest of 20% with cpf and cash. Cos bank only loan you up to 75%. If you do not wanna fork out cash then you can take hdb loan then change to bank loan. This will be call refinancing which total duration will take around 6months and you will be paying hdb loan interest rate for 6months before you refinance. In the long run is worth as banks are doing fixed interest rate at 1.4-1.5% for 5 years compare to HDB loan at 2.5%. By doing refinancing  you don‚Äôt have to fork out cash for those who doesn‚Äôt want to throw in cash,btohqsg
Oh I paid my 5% in cash when choosing unit so no difference to me if I change now. The remaining can be using Cpf. I‚Äôm getting 1.25% based on floating now but probably will change to 5 years fixed 1.4% upon key collection. Free conversion during key collection for the bank loan I took up.,btohqsg
Since you paid cash then just let HDB know you wanna change to bank loan before key collection instead,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôve informed them early March. But my key collection is 3Q so not sure if change to bank loan will delay key collection due to paper works etc,btohqsg
Haha erm just decided to save the Cpf first rather than having to ‚Äúincur‚Äù interest for few years even before getting house. But good thing I did that then cause converting to bank loan now.,btohqsg
Very wise  not many people are willing to do it this way,btohqsg
Thanks. Lucky bank loan interest still low.,btohqsg
May I know anyone have any update on May SBF -2021 ?,btohqsg
I dont think so got sbf eh,btohqsg
Should have but details only out during launch,btohqsg
How long does it takes to get a flat from pphs?,btohqsg
Tiagong the queue is very jialat,btohqsg
If find mp for help got use ??? üòÇ,btohqsg
MP might ask you to approach HDB first,btohqsg
If got use ah  those in long queue sure go find MP too,btohqsg
Unless you have a solid reason  strong valid reason,btohqsg
tiagong even if you have cleared the principle amount and the accrued interest of your CPFOA  the interest is still compounding  can anyone share is it true?,btohqsg
means say you opted for 20 years loan but clear it on the 10th year  the AI still running,btohqsg
AI nothing to do with loan right?,btohqsg
CPF is like a bank  the moment you used the OA  it starts to charge you interest,btohqsg
unless you're using cash entirely without touching your CPF just like@fishteeth,btohqsg
like I have used 22k three years ago for my down-payment  and the AI is already $1500,btohqsg
the difference is  the AI is rightfully ours  not gahmen's,btohqsg
I‚Äôll still use Cpf when I get the keys for my house for the remaining 20% that I cannot borrow from bank. Can only borrow 75% from bank.,btohqsg
Wah. Three years interest $1500 for 22k usage?,btohqsg
Ya i mean AI not related to housing loan. Meaning if someone doesn't take loan  but uses CPF to pay for the house  he will still incur AI,btohqsg
haha if you  are still using cash for full payment  you're really jskm,btohqsg
If use $220k  will be $15000 of interest in three years.,btohqsg
At least the AI can be used to pay for next property so still ok,btohqsg
my mum used $128k and her AI is already 55k 14 years later,btohqsg
it is good if your profit from selling the house is $100k after minus all the incurred charges,btohqsg
Quite hard I think. Renovation costs a bomb nowadays,btohqsg
reno for my 3r so far is at $16k incl GST,btohqsg
Ohh. Mines more. But think will stay longer than 5 years,btohqsg
How do u pay back the money u took from cpf?,btohqsg
Means like top up your cpf?,btohqsg
wait sorry  am i reading this correctly?principle 100interest 20U mean this 120 u full cleared?Or u only cleared the 100 principle?,btohqsg
but how does the AI being computed since the amount has already been cleared,btohqsg
full clear then supposed to stop rolling,btohqsg
don't understand this part - Note also that depending on the circumstances of the sale  you (as the seller) may also need to refund option monies. If the sales proceeds (after excluding the equivalent of option monies) is enough to make the full CPF refund  then you don‚Äôt need to refund the option monies.,btohqsg
don't think that's right. if full clear they charge u interest based on what sum?,btohqsg
