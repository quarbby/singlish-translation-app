Ngl idk if I should just do that,btohqsg
I’ll try to study as much as I can during my free time,btohqsg
No legit it's dumb u get all the downfalls and responsibilities of uni without the freedom and lax,btohqsg
I jumped to Molecular DNA biology and full on genetics before we even learnt like microbiology and advanced biology,btohqsg
If you think you can get 90rp do it lo if not you just wasting more time,btohqsg
Idk who the heck designed it that way,btohqsg
There were so many dropouts ngl,btohqsg
Oh ya your ord is one more year,btohqsg
Then I guess it’s just money,btohqsg
Just entering the class and be like oh were did she go one day there next day gone,btohqsg
at this point you're just smurfing in A levels,btohqsg
I still legit don’t know your real grades lol,btohqsg
But wtv la if you retake hopefully you hit it,btohqsg
i can harbor a pretty accurate guess,btohqsg
but i shall not do that,btohqsg
I’m guessing all are A to C,btohqsg
To P to E to R to M to A to N,btohqsg
If u made it to uni from poly,btohqsg
honestly if you can make it from poly to uni,btohqsg
nothing in uni should faze you anymore,btohqsg
The odds are stacked against your favour especially big 3,btohqsg
most people i know from poly are already the ones that are doing well from sem 1 onwards tbh (at least the ones that came from relevant poly dip to relevant uni major),btohqsg
Bruh I chose Alevel cuz getting a 3.5 is harder and more stressful,btohqsg
if i go to poly i aint getting a 3.5 lmao thats why i had to do A levels,btohqsg
Just go back to taking h1 geog if you retake,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorto get a 3.5 the work I have to do is write an analysis report and understand the image I sent u,btohqsg
Then maybe you need someone to mark your work,btohqsg
Bro not worth my sanity for that hell no,btohqsg
That one need to ask your old chers or get tuition,btohqsg
Might be sth to do with the new syllabus which is why I see more fluctuations between prelim grades to As,btohqsg
Bruh OK..  for h2 bio students just to give yall context,btohqsg
Besides me there’s quite a few others I expected to get A end up B/C for a levels,btohqsg
You know gel electrophoresis doing that in the lab,btohqsg
When u try to load the sample into the wells,btohqsg
It's like tryna do that but with no spillage + steadily and accurately + the Wells are less defined,btohqsg
I think new syllabus they also changed the way they mark but it’s not very clear,btohqsg
He retook everything cos other H2s screwed up?,btohqsg
My cher kept talking about the 2 requirements thing,btohqsg
Plus she said they care more about proper explanations,btohqsg
There's a joke bro. I spent 2 years learning how to use a micropipette,btohqsg
From what they heard during marking workshops,btohqsg
I know how to take up 1/1000th of a drop.,btohqsg
2nd case I heard of someone doing Econs in both 2022 and 2023 and getting a worse grade in 2023,btohqsg
Hais maybe the extra time is a curse in disguise,btohqsg
They probably became more picky in certain areas I’m not sure off,btohqsg
So he basically got 2h15min for the same paper,btohqsg
Lol yeah Cambridge was very lazy in 2023,btohqsg
I rmbr my Econs tutor was surprised,btohqsg
I think last time there was a syllabus change the papers weren’t the same,btohqsg
Yeah likely they adjust the grade boundaries to make up for it,btohqsg
