Hi all  was thinking of putting 20k into Chocolate Finance. Isit safe?,btohqsg

Hi  I'm using crmc + amaze to get 4mpd. Crmc excludes travel related spending but if I use amaze to pay for air ticket  is it still excluded or is this a way around it? üòÅ,btohqsg
seems this is favourite now beside the lady solitary card,btohqsg
Use another card for travel expenses. If you want a card that points does not expire  citi premier would be a good choice. If you want perks and willing to pay annual fees  citi prestige will be good. And I pair with amaze to reduce fx fees,btohqsg
Guys   pls recommend me the cheapest and stable fibre broadband?,btohqsg
Did anyone received hsbc sms for EGA eligibility for Nov?,btohqsg
Hi   For OCBC 360 account  does the monthly instalment payment for credit card counts towards the $500 minimum spend?,btohqsg
Using m1 2.5g. So far so good,btohqsg
simba $29.99 should be cheapest been using for few weeks  so far so good,btohqsg
Anyone know how long uob lady card takes the approve application?,btohqsg
Oh I meant duration to approval,btohqsg
Putting in since around mid or slightly later of this year  been okay so far,btohqsg
Same for me also. However  I can get max 3.3gbps only from the 10gbps plan. I‚Äôm using a 10g wired router to pull from the ONT so it is not a problem with setup.Wifi 7 is giving me good speeds though at around 800mbps for iPhones and 1.7gbps for iPad Pro M4.I consider this a win since it is so cheap.,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/important-information/changes-to-smart-cc-faqs/Incoming nerf to SC Smart card,btohqsg
I was told to wait 2-3 weeks‚Ä¶?,btohqsg
Aiyoh  nerfed to bits and now got annual fee ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶It will become a 4% card now due to how selective the categories are.,btohqsg
Worse than a 4%. Ain't no way I'm spending $800 on maccas and Simplygo. It's like Live+ but worse,btohqsg
If you spend $800  still got 8% but I see the categories  very hard.Live+ need to see if they extend the bonus 3%.Problem is where to spend on public transport now ‚Ä¶..Maybe Citi SMRT. Got 5% and wider categories for min $500 spend. For miles maybe UOB Ladies. I‚Äôll explore a bit.,btohqsg
Can check if simba can use lan to connect to desktop or only wifi?,btohqsg
Can use direct to LAN. Just need to make sure you have ports in your router to maximise it. Cost break point is 2.5gbps at the moment.,btohqsg
4% bonus is only valid til March 31 2025 ü§°,btohqsg
Anyone recently applied for maribank? How long did it take you? Cos I tot with singpass should be instant but looks like not approved yet,btohqsg
Yess instantly approve  but need to request for card through the app for them to send the card,btohqsg
Do I need to buy my own WiFi router?,btohqsg
Hi gurus Just sign up citi premier thru singsaver for the $400 cashIf use to pay for insurance   telco and Keppel bill - counted as spend $500 in order to get the $400 cash gift in 2-3 mths time ?And pair up with amaze  shall I use amaze to pay for online/dinning expense or to use citi to get the 4mpd ?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Citi premier no 4mpd thou. Did u mean citi rewards?,btohqsg
Sc Smart card changes their reward system.,btohqsg
What the next go to transport card then? I would use Uob KF.,btohqsg
Just read the breakdown. Which idiot would willingly pay $200 for public transport? Just get a monthly concession pass already at that juncture,btohqsg
It's a huge buff only to a specific group of people.,btohqsg
More nerf. shld be useless card liao. Cannot find use case.,btohqsg
I cannot fathom anyone who can realistically hit the 10% bonus spending category unless they can consistently pool the purchases with groups of people,btohqsg
