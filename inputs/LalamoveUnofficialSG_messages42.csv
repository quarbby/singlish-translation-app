Sender refund receiver $180+deliver fees full..nego for cake $100 with sender,btohqsg
No more complicated cake..send a few normal cake no issue ..,btohqsg
He could have easily charge u full cost,btohqsg
The cake shop all they have to do is to touch up and patch up the cake using cream,btohqsg

How to cancel order after I reached merchant?I clicked on cancel but the order is still there.,btohqsg
What time does live chat close? I am on live chat with them but no one is responding.,btohqsg
Best is call n confirm.. That's what i usually do before arriving at pick up point,btohqsg
So if its cash logo.. can be either vendor or customer pay?,btohqsg
If got purple logo confirm its customer pay right,btohqsg
So always call the requestor to confirm,btohqsg
The dollar note next to amt means collect cash.,btohqsg
As to who pay it depends.. Like my these two jobs  Tampines & tai seng are the ones who paid me,btohqsg
Tai seng was the requestor  Tampines was the requestor. I contacted both before i head over to pick up location.,btohqsg
I completed 7 orders but still 4 in llm,btohqsg
Oh if we collect cash payment.. we need to top up to account?,btohqsg

Cos even u travel at 80. The speed recorded by tp will be around 76 to 77,btohqsg
If clean record so far  first time chances r will give chance,btohqsg
I travel above 20 km limit daily on a stretch of road... So far many years Bo dai jiüòÖ,btohqsg
Furnish driver details is to update tp who is the driver.  if there is fine and demerit points they will do it accordingly.,btohqsg

Later evening shld b better. Holiday eve will have more orders. Hopefully ü§£,btohqsg
I dunno if anyone go thru cb period...no stacking..1 time slot within 55mjns 1 order..got what take what..,btohqsg
No stacking cos lack of orders/ too many couriers? Or mandated by llm?,btohqsg
I sent to pasir panjang outside the gate wont even think abt secure ..policd cantonment outside gate..,btohqsg
The TOS is pretty clear  PU or DO to these addresses have a secure zone fee  how the transaction is conducted is btw u and the sender/receiver. Doesnt matter if it is gate or 25 floors up.If the user is not the end receiver  there is no wrong in asking.,btohqsg
There are things no need to be so calculative..got order better than no orders..outside camp/police station/habour office..as long not mafan to changr pass no need secure zone fees...thats my opinion,btohqsg
Inidvidial ..cause if never go thru the cb period ..u dont know the pain of hanging ard to bid for jobs..waste more time LL than send orders,btohqsg
Now stack orders most sender dont complain if we abit late..quite hosay ..,btohqsg
Hope don't cb again  if nope die,btohqsg
This was my school of thought last time too. But after kenna wait 20mins for the fella to stroll to the guard house  despite me calling him 5 mins be4 ETA....i whack all secure zone,btohqsg
Sure die one..u camp for orders till dulan,btohqsg
Plus a lot of camps are in ulu places  it compensates for the one way drive back,btohqsg
Ya some camps quite anal  dont allow u to leave the food and go. Must wait for the person to pick up,btohqsg
Dun wAn pay   i go n eat n food,btohqsg
Our hourly consist of waiting and loading/unloading parking etc not just when petrol is burning so any risk of extended waiting time  better to get more than less. Imho,btohqsg
Yes i agree go thru CS is the better way  i got banned from Mcdonalds for asking for secure zone lol  and another fast food joint....they had to call manager then head office then to llm to add the fees,btohqsg
Better to just let CS do the work,btohqsg
I still 5 star for a reason LOL kidding (touch wood choy pui,btohqsg
If late over 1 hr how. I awaz late not I want but due to some unforeseen circumstances,btohqsg
Like just now go 1condo cannot go up liftüòÖ. Need to climb 16 floor. Can claim or not,btohqsg
Best to call receiver and explain ur situation. As long as they dont complain to llm or give u bad rating  nothing will happen,btohqsg
Yah  ytd I on a ms job. The GPS keep bringing me in circles  the do pt recipient nvr answer hp. I call the order person  I very pek chek liao  cos in rush  speak quite loud  he tell me don't speak so loud. üòÇ,btohqsg
Complete job call back tell him sorry  my voice is naturally loud üòÇ heng he ok,btohqsg
Those who put in the notes deliver asap  dont stack  best is to follow and deliver asap cos they are the ones that stalks ur route and will complain and rate bad,btohqsg
He say ok does not mean will not give bad ratinhüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
If rating drop to 2   what will happen ?,btohqsg
Nowadays tan jiak difficult just send food aso ratingüòÇüòÇüòç,btohqsg
U wont smell 2 lol  4.5 and below suspended liaoz,btohqsg
Its avg of 40 ratings  so if u kenna one 2 stars only it will drop to 4.8+/-,btohqsg
How many jobs u do liaoz,btohqsg
I email cs to explain n ask them to remove the bad rating as I didn't show any bad attitude to the user,btohqsg
Food send slow can aso bad rating,btohqsg
U will need to email asap to explain once u receive this type of sms,btohqsg
I dun dare stack too gao lut noeü§£,btohqsg
I email liao  now pending from them  sien  rushing for them to send still kana bad rating,btohqsg
It could be possible 16 orders customer nvr rate u at all then u kenna one sway 2* rating,btohqsg
Its a thankless jobs mostly i realised  only 1 in 10 appreciate,btohqsg
think they go by how many bad ratings you get. i was on 1-star for a few weeks  can take missions fine. it was my only rating.,btohqsg
Then Tuesday I receive sms then email liao,btohqsg

Match till sien end up do 2 only then go drive grab hitch,btohqsg
my 1star was before smart matching.,btohqsg
Many drops but one parcel only $7.....,btohqsg
Haiz  never fxxk n scold n show bad attitude also kana bad rating,btohqsg
Ya lo  how to increase? Do more jobs ?,btohqsg
this only works if rating is super low. most cx only rate to complain.,btohqsg
Its a mountain to climb  email them to remove the bad rating,btohqsg
Ya  I email them ady  still pending....,btohqsg
Otherwise chiong to do 40 jobs for it to laspes,btohqsg
Rating is based on last 40 orders,btohqsg
got to hustle to get 40 5-stars in a row.,btohqsg
Y all so free chat here. No need feed the hungry ppl?,btohqsg
A lot of restros do not bother to rate,btohqsg
Which is no issue if u have 5*  if less than 5* they wont bring your avg up,btohqsg
nope  the rating is just a complaint mechanism for them.,btohqsg
Bobian  life still goes on  can do then do lo,btohqsg
Bro  u kana before? Did the cs hell u remove the bad rating ?,btohqsg
If the lalamove user restaurant sibeh ccb  I will go back the restaurant makan....,btohqsg

A transaction is all needed btw...if she is working for ikea...ikea should fire her because she took advantage on her working hrs to get some side income which sadly falls under bribery which can be led to cpib case...CBT also can take into account on this case...company entrust her to deal with delivery service in a professional and right way...not choosing drivers and earn commission...this is illegal...if this were to be reported...all of her accounts will be freeze and the authority will dig out everything including the transaction made to her acc or someone related to her...soon she willl get caught u just wait and see,btohqsg
Need to whistle blow lah these type of small transactions will hardly get caught without someone whistleblowing,btohqsg
Small amount or big amount does not matter...the amount matters only when sentencing to see how severe the caseis...the crime is committed still will be punishable by law...,btohqsg

Need to inform llm. Claim 50%,btohqsg
normally wat is e rating we need to maintain to get missions??,btohqsg
This 1 is they have to cancel. If u call them n cfm the order b4 u go down  then they have another driver cos duplicate order  u must let llm know. Then can ask for 50% fee. If nvr call them  llm will say its ur fault for calling.,btohqsg
U can either try using the live chat or call in,btohqsg
Do not tell llm u want cancel order. Its not ur fault. If driver cancel too often will lead to suspension,btohqsg
Sometimes when the customer cancel  I see my jobs cancelled also write driver cancel. Once I see that I immediately contact llm to cfm its not meüòÇ,btohqsg
