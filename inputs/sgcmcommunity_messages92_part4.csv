CPF purpose was for house üè†To chase Kampung dweller into apartment,btohqsg

They don't own but they will rent ma...,btohqsg
lets be honest if i had money id also want more than 2 cars hahaha,btohqsg
So if they drive back also no point ma...,btohqsg

Since the purpose is same as taxi,btohqsg
Buying one normal car can get you something better in other countries sia some more they can keep it,btohqsg
