Anyway true storySomeone pm me ask for a tip. Knows him to play big positions profits could be in 10k regionTell me he can pick up and hold.I say ok. Send him world vision website donate 1k I tell uClearly he didn‚Äôt. And not happy about itMy point being: if u can trade and profit/ loss in region of 5 digit what is 1k?I don‚Äôt earn anything. It may not be genuine kindness as some friends pointed out. I‚Äôm not bothered  the underprivileged get food whether money is sincere or notHowever for someone who is used to getting something for free  $1 price is $1 too much.I have no intention to shame as I‚Äôm not naming anyone. My point is simplyThere is always a time to pass it on. Kindness don‚Äôt have to wait for a certain net worth to commence. The best time is now right now. If u decide to be a leech all your life you will wonder why no good things happen to u. It‚Äôs a cycle it‚Äôs never about what u get but what u give. Returns are always magnified when u don‚Äôt expect them,btohqsg
Bo. Holding very little counters in sgx,btohqsg

The pool of money then they split to help them,btohqsg
Choose child also don't know who more cham,btohqsg
They also dunno who more cham,btohqsg
Maybe is fate that u choose them,btohqsg
Ya lor.. Hoot one amount let them distribute better,btohqsg

Withdraw because contract not yet signed,btohqsg
Basically contract no sign. Deposit money received.,btohqsg
And they reported if upon receiving the money,btohqsg
I don't think Aspen received any money...only issue invoice to Honeywell,btohqsg
First hand info all run road alr,btohqsg
Don't know is Honeywell play punk or Aspen anyhow bomb....,btohqsg
This shows one thing.. aspen highly menupolated stock by insiders.. how come before good news stock start to move up and now bad news with ppe sentiment good aspen keep selling down,btohqsg
can say bye to 275 for now,btohqsg
Like that anyhow bomb can sue aspen not. LoL,btohqsg
Maybe coz Honeywell press them to take back their announcement.. so they no choice must announce on weekend,btohqsg
i seriously think cannot touch Aspen....,btohqsg
Like that Monday morning hong gan liao huh? üò©,btohqsg
Haha. Contract sign at later stage then bomb up again?,btohqsg
Like that really will go drink kopi,btohqsg
erm...seriously not nice to share people's photo and laugh at them,btohqsg
Really what retract means Honeywell dun wan to enter or buay song that they haven sign the contract.,btohqsg
GG Aspen....live up its name Ass pain,btohqsg
If latter sure will have another announcement say sign liao ma,btohqsg
if they deposit means still keen ma,btohqsg
No deposit la.. its invoice not receipt,btohqsg
Cfm heavy selling on monday since last few days ppl alr load off,btohqsg
Ya la they no need to pay anything now,btohqsg
Insider already sell last week.. now will be retailer panic sell,btohqsg
Not shareholder kana play backside meh,btohqsg
Ya lor.. but ill give it a try,btohqsg
you still decent enough to give people ample warning you going to short . At least the people in the chat got chance to get out first on monday =D,btohqsg
I short is not gonna make difference la.. I small fly,btohqsg
Monday sure super low liao la.,btohqsg
20 will hold.. I dont think will be so bad,btohqsg
Last time 3mil$ was pumped by retailer.. so I think decent amount is held by them.. maybe have small opportunity to make quick play,btohqsg
haha i think it doesn't take much to short Aspen on Monday since others will also have the same idea....,btohqsg
Based on the float 1mil share short is not gonna make dif,btohqsg
What a waste....now Glove Rally  Aspen reverse. Harder to convince retail investor to stick with them.,btohqsg
I never short before so if you all got short let me know...I see what is the effect like on Monday,btohqsg
Ya la. All waiting them start glove then give bomb,btohqsg
Never study contract law de meh,btohqsg
0.2 have to hold that‚Äôs for sure,btohqsg
0.2 is like the floodgate  break below that damage control very hard,btohqsg
I wonder why it took them 10 days to realize the deal is not confirm.. could it be that the deal is confirm to be a no go?,btohqsg
Remind me of CNMC  break below $0.20  lowest point it reach around $0.16,btohqsg
If we see another announcement that confirm the deal called off then 20 cannot hold..,btohqsg
Aspen actually didnt rally much from the honeywell news,btohqsg
Why would the deal being called off bring it lower,btohqsg
Its menupolated stock la.. before good announcement price already will start to move up.. 205 to 275 a few times.. then they release announcement and insider will sell,btohqsg
This time.. insider start to sell before the announcement,btohqsg
All stocks are manipulated... Just the degree of which it is .,btohqsg
Wonder who the aspen BBs are though. Really v dirty,btohqsg
maybe they kena played out too,btohqsg
On 12 April 2021  AGSB had completed all necessary internal formalities including obtaining itsBoard‚Äôs approval and formally executed the Agreement and delivered the Agreementelectronically to Honeywell together with the Invoice on the same day. AGSB believed thatHoneywell‚Äôs execution of the Agreement was imminent given that 12 April 2021 was noted as theeffective date in the unexecuted Agreement.,btohqsg
They send the document electronically...maybe it went into the junk mail so HW never get to see....,btohqsg
Contract sign halt  contract unsigned draggggggggggggggggggg and let insiders sell.Really no eye see.,btohqsg
""" unexecuted Agreement""....so they also know that it was not confirmed since HW haven't sign yet....but they dare to just announce like that?",btohqsg
I think this is very highly likely,btohqsg
cannot like wait 1 or 2 days for HW to respond to them first meh??? or the next 2 weeks also wont die,btohqsg
Think insiders dulan why hold so long,btohqsg
the more i read the withdrawal reason the more bullshit I think Aspen is giving.....,btohqsg
Never study contract law lo.No sign means not entered leh. I think everyone knows except him lo.,btohqsg
"They made news like ""Blockchain based logistic management""",btohqsg
How do you take them seriously after that,btohqsg
"lol....they very good at ""packaging"" I give them that",btohqsg
Because for Aspen..Good news drop..Bad news drop drop drop~üòÖü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Just cut if the relationship doesn‚Äôt work out to how you imagine it to be.,btohqsg
Monday morning look see look see bah~This counter ah really~Opportunity cost si bei high..ü§¨,btohqsg
shud call them Anyhow Goreng group,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like companies that always publish news for example Biolitic  Allset etcI like company that silently grows only financial reports eventually tell the whole story,btohqsg
The body language and expression tells a lot of story,btohqsg
maybe short more and collect cheap,btohqsg
Just hope don‚Äôt spoil mood for other counters,btohqsg
If it does then mon Sian liao lo,btohqsg
I dun think it affects too much...I look at Bursa  SGX: TG/RS/MT/UG as guidance to overall medical sentiment,btohqsg
Then maybe others gloves counter benefits ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
Bursa glove stock price is currently in the middle between 52w low and 52w high. If the RSS over at Bursa raise white flag  got chance to rally 25% more at current share price (personal opinion  DYODD) RSS= Regulated Short Sell  (Bursa cap at maximum 4%),btohqsg
Why would a counter which didnt even produce a single glove affect other glove counters?,btohqsg
I think is general sentiments ba.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt exactly have to be medical,btohqsg
Got to see how many bought into its glove vision,btohqsg
No la asspain dont have power to spoil sentiment for other medical ppe.. I dont think anyone will take Aspen serious after this,btohqsg
I nv had any problem leh...I think the platform very stable,btohqsg
Wah! Where you dig this screenshot sia!? ü§£,btohqsg
Just that I never had money nor energy in the first place,btohqsg
Sell to below 20  BBs collect enough then have the contact signed,btohqsg
May not  Aspen was range bound ard 22 b4 Honeywell 210 Mill contract announcement. If no such blunder  aspen may have move up together with other medical stocks. The sell down last few days was quite obvious of the doing of those in the know. Same like the price movement up b4 the honeywell contract announcement. This shows the lacking in Aspen way of keeping sensitive information.,btohqsg
Which means BBs of Apsen gets fist hand info leak while all other retail investors kept in the dark?,btohqsg
Yes agree  aspen was already trading around 23 to 25 range before release of Honeywell deal. At least what we know now is that this deal is in the pipeline  just that the agreement has not been officially signed. Rubber gloves are in strong demand worldwide  I'm sure they have no problem getting other buyers for them.,btohqsg
If this is any indication  the price was moving down cos the sellers know the deal was not confirmed. Any confirmation of the deal will propel the price beyond 27.,btohqsg
Maybe no fault of the mgt. I remember aspen halted a day or 2 for the announcement. It cud be the mgt realised the price movement up b4 that n thus halted to wait for honeywell confirmation. But cud not wait longer as halting more than 3 days may result in suspension. Thus made the blunder of announcing on 12 Apr. The price action after lifting of halt was very strange. Especially when all other medical stocks are in play. Think now looking back at the sequence of event it explain the drop last few days. But I'm betting going forward it may shoot up after initial shock this coming week,btohqsg
There is no change to their fundamental and glove production is on schedule. But there will definitely be panic sellers and shortists taking the opportunity tomorrow. Which one are u?,btohqsg
I personally think the mgt took considerable risk to jump into gloves. The risk assessment and due diligence done months ago was convincing enough for me that aspen wants growth and sustainability. I believe CMY will provide the network to the group. I'm more incline to think aspen has potential going forward. I'm holding  and will buy more if drop further. The key thing I'm looking at is the upfront payment by customers  otherwise may add pressure to aspen capex and ops expenses.,btohqsg
I think luckily other medical stocks are in a rally at the moment  and thus shortlists also cautious. Otherwise the short selling will be fierce,btohqsg
There was placement done some months ago at ard 23 cents I think. So I hope the BBs know what they are doing.,btohqsg

"Tradeview Commentaries - Retail Investors  Please Thread With Caution On Some Glove "" Goreng"" StocksFor retail investors who are looking to invest in glove stocks once again  I have a sincere view to share with all even though I may not be in the position to dish out advice as investments are very personal decisions. One should only invest in glove sector if you believe in the fundamentals. One should not invest in the glove sector just because you think the Covid-19 cases are rising again locally and domestically. Your investment shouldn' t be sentiment driven or short term in horizon. You should invest because you believe in the earnings visibility  yield  strong balance sheet  management and potential of the sector.I noticed past few weeks since the glove stocks rally restarted  there have been many ancillary stocks shooting up (especially goreng stocks) once again following the limelight of the major glove companies. As retail investors  you must protect yourself as no one will protect you. Make wise decision. Do not enter a stock just because you think a thematic rotation into Healthcare stocks are underway. One must separate wheat from chaff. Those so called "" glove related companies"" who failed to deliver earnings and execute MOUs / orders signed should be avoided at all cost. Those companies who suddenly announced in the past 2 weeks in the media that their company secured how many orders at what price and will commence production soon or venturing into glove sector  please ignore these companies. It is completely nonsensical that these companies can do better than the incumbent market leaders.We have very good fundamentally sound glove companies in Malaysia. I have written extensively on this before. But be selective. Please do not get caught up in the hype. If you do like glove stocks  only invest in those which are market leaders and delivering record earnings & yield. These companies will be able to sustain long into the future. Those new entrants and making fresh ventures / MOU / announcements are just lemon stocks being "" operated"" to trap retail investors. Do exercise caution.Source :www.tradeview.my",btohqsg
Yes unnamed could be due to confidentiality of buyer.,btohqsg
I think is not bb run.. is insider run.. maybe bb also kanna play,btohqsg
I wonder why they didn't announce if they received the 30% of the 100mil deal yet,btohqsg
Maybe tomorrow AGM will provide some answers,btohqsg
Don't think they are required to do so for every payment in a deal.,btohqsg
Either way I'm gonna short at open.. high chance will have some quick play down,btohqsg
Given the nature of Aspen.. they any small news also announce,btohqsg
may already gap down no meat,btohqsg
So I'm surprised they would announce 30% deposit,btohqsg
If open 22 can short to 20.. anything below may not be worth,btohqsg
I wouldn't risk shorting as the price has sell down prior to this retract announcement. However  I suspect this news will allow them to recover their shorts.,btohqsg
Isn't short need to recover same day?,btohqsg
The breakdown by age looks like this:Baby Boomers:‚ÄØBaby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. They're currently between 57-75 years old (71.6 million in the U.S.)Gen X:‚ÄØGen X was born between 1965 and 1979/80 and is currently between 41-56 years old (65.2 million people in the U.S.)Gen Y:‚ÄØGen Y  or Millennials  were born between 1981 and 1994/6. They are currently between 25 and 40 years old (72.1 million in the U.S.)Gen Y.1 = 25-29 years old (around 31 million people in the U.S.)Gen Y.2 = 29-39 (around 42 million people in the U.S.)Gen Z:‚ÄØGen Z is the newest generation  born between 1997 and 2012/15. They are currently between 6 and 24 years old (nearly 68 million in the U.S.)The term ‚ÄúMillennial‚Äù has become the popular way to reference both segments of Gen Y (more on Y.1 and Y.2 below).And as for ‚ÄúZillennials ‚Äù‚ÄØthose wedged at the tail end of Millennials and the start of Gen Z are sometimes labeled with this moniker ‚Äî a group made up of people born between 1994 and the year 2000.Realistically  the name‚ÄØGeneration Z‚ÄØis a placeholder for the youngest people on the planet. It‚Äôs likely to morph as they leave adolescence and mature into their adult identities.,btohqsg

Hong Kong-Singapore Air Travel Bubble to Start on May 261. Flights under the agreement -- which allows people to travel quarantine free between the financial hubs -- will begin from May 26  said the people  who asked not to be identified as they‚Äôre not authorized to speak publicly. The number of flights will be increased by June 26 if there aren‚Äôt further outbreaks in either city  one of the people said.2. Hong Kong and Singapore have been working on the creation of a travel corridor for months after plans for a November start were shelved due to a virus flareup in the Chinese territory. A plan to announce its revival last week was also canceled at the last minute by the Singapore side  people familiar with the matter said at the time.3. The Hong Kong government said a discussion with Singapore on the re-launch ‚Äúis at an advance stage and the government will make announcement as soon as practicable.‚Äù Singapore‚Äôs transport ministry referred Bloomberg News to its most recent press release on the matter. Singapore last week said the two cities had not fixed a date to announce the resumption of the bubble  but ‚Äúwill do so once we are ready  hopefully very soon.‚Äù4. The Hong Kong-Singapore agreement should unleash a torrent of pent-up demand from people eager to fly overseas and potentially do business in person after more than a year of the pandemic  though it is unclear yet the limited number of flights or seats that will be made available. The desire to travel in any way possible is reflected in the popularity of so-called cruises to nowhere in Singapore and tickets selling out for gimmicky dinners on parked aircraft.5. Under previous travel bubble plans  flights will be operated by Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The two airlines have been hammered by Covid-19 as they don‚Äôt have domestic markets to compensate for a near-total collapse in international travel. Latest data show Cathay flew just 598 passengers a day on average in March as it operated a skeleton schedule to only 18 destinations. Singapore Airlines‚Äô numbers are also just a tiny fraction of pre-pandemic levels.More here,btohqsg
