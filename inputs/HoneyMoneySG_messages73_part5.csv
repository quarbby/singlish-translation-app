Hsbc revol have whitelist merchant u need to see if it is included,btohqsg
If you have time to read the chat history  you will know how the nerf story unfold. Every time people call cso  few weeks later  bank announced the nerf.,btohqsg
It is because it cost too much to bank to sustain once alot know the hack but hsbc ega have been around quite long liao. Ega stop the bonus interest for a few month and regain in nov/dec,btohqsg
Bank got datapoint to show them what each promo and spending bring them. To attract customer they need to bring in competitive product. Costing and benefit and is point they consider.,btohqsg
Hi folks  currently my HSBC EGA balance is 0. To earn the latest 4.5%  do i just need to register SMS and make 5 FAST transfer to top up EGA ?,btohqsg
U need to go that to earn the 1 percent and then top up 100k incremental from sep adb to earn 3.5 so total 4.5,btohqsg
not excluded. Can get 4mpd if online  can use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard to convert to online but incur 1% Amaze fees,btohqsg
On 31 Oct  somebody mentioned about NTB for ocbc is 6 months in another chat group  OCBC quickly amend the NTB status to 12 months today. The response from OCBC is pretty fast. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Then there must be spy in the chat group,btohqsg
Ah okay So for any SGD transaction  we would avoid using Instarem correct?,btohqsg
Not really  normal retail still no fee but earn 4mp on citi rewards,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need to spy on the chat  he wrote it on his blog itself.,btohqsg
Besides Iâ€™m sure every credit card product manager reads ML    should be part of the jobâ€™s market research and monitoring component ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yeah u mean the milelion blog page right haha he put there only ocbc ntb 6 mth haha. Next day later nerf to 1 year haha,btohqsg
Alot of hack is frequently written on seth and milelions blog,btohqsg
After posted not long before it gets nerfed ...,btohqsg
Citi rewards plus amaze is a long hack liao  dont think citi dont know about it  just whether they want to nerf it or not,btohqsg
Local bank tend to be alot more stingy then international bank,btohqsg
The more the bank knows  the more the nerfs.,btohqsg
I know what you're trying to imply  but it's also funny coz it implies that the bank  who developed the product  know less than others.,btohqsg
that's not wrong  if you recall the 8mpd apple pay promotion by citibank,btohqsg
My friend got alot of miles from that promo until the bank bans him from spending on citibank card. Until now his card application with citibank keep getting rejected.,btohqsg
He got near 2 million miles from that promotion,btohqsg
that sounds hilarious. hope he at least managed to transfer all his miles out before they terminated his accounts ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This can happen especially my friend repay his card to regain limit during the promotion period. He got near 200k or more grocery voucher for his company during that promo,btohqsg
So citibank only see this crazy user buy 200k in supermarket during the promo period and thus he got ban,btohqsg
"I think my friend got contacted by citibank direct to inform they wont award him 8 mpd for any further spending due to the ""abnormal spending"" behaviour on his card",btohqsg
Do remember in bank tnc there is a clause that stated they have right to amend it anytime and if they suspect your spending is not for personal usage.,btohqsg
This is why i say bank have datapoint to see and amend the tnc along the way,btohqsg
lol  can spend finish the miles before they expire?,btohqsg
He convert it during the sia bonus 15 percent so get alot of bonus from conversion too during the covid period,btohqsg
Anyway not sure if anyone is spending regularly at nex,btohqsg
hi just wanna ask if i pay thru instalments via atome for agoda  does it still qualify as travel spending?,btohqsg
Pay via atome is not under travel mcc,btohqsg
Can the uob debit card also be used as part of the 500 to earn interest,btohqsg
Yes uob one debit card work as well,btohqsg
Anyone know for Citibank cash back card right  I spent $800 already but because got $80 cashback  the outstanding is $720. Will Citibank take it as never met min. of $800 like this?,btohqsg
For dbs can I from POSB saving acc bank transfer to my dbs mutilper by salary is it counted? Or must other bank,btohqsg
Existing hsbc need to spend how much to get another 50 voucher?,btohqsg

So must use other ppl de bank?,btohqsg
ur own account from other bank also can,btohqsg
