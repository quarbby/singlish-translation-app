There’s a evil maths paper made by someone from NYJC,btohqsg

hard to make worksheets from scratch,btohqsg
not impossible  but time consuming :(,btohqsg

U should feel good man HAHAHA,btohqsg
Is rly copy and paste from past yr prelim papers for o levels,btohqsg
But where do they come from,btohqsg
There must be a first question,btohqsg
A levels i heard is from a question bank from MOE,btohqsg
Just that I never seen it yet in a sec sch setting,btohqsg
From which all other papers are made,btohqsg
Meanwhile nyjc math papers have a PhD teacher to help set questions,btohqsg
"Suddenly got weird topics they ""guide"" you through",btohqsg

Gonna make someone potentially fail their test next week too :(,btohqsg
good luck im done with that shit long sg9,btohqsg
4 more yrs to go startin this aug,btohqsg
As long as nothing like Artinian rings come out  should be fine,btohqsg
No idea. They are rings I guess.,btohqsg
So my dad just told me if i go nus sci faculty and get straight As after first yr I can change course to cs can I verify if this is true?,btohqsg
He told me that's what his China students who grad from the private sch he's teaching at are doing but idw to blindly believe,btohqsg
Never heard of it but I assume by change course he means take up CS as a second major?,btohqsg
I think he meant change completely??idk,btohqsg
I do know that if you wanna declare a second major in CS in your uni life your grades must be good though,btohqsg
It’s not one of those second majors you can declare out of the blue,btohqsg
What's the difference between first and second major tho,btohqsg
Hmm first major is the one you can say you home faculty is I’d say,btohqsg
Double major is just sort of saying I’m going be studying these 2 fields,btohqsg
