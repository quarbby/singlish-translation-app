Not duplicate man. One‚Äôs for 2 drops and the other is just for 1 drop. See properly dude.,btohqsg
Not sure  but that‚Äôll put them off for sure.,btohqsg
And if they agree? Then what?,btohqsg
I saw 2 orders like these this morning  one with 1 drop more than the other  but first 2 addresses the same. So what happened is that the customer  instead of amending her order  she created a new one with the additional drop. But my customer remembered to delete the old one.Not sure if that's the case for your customer  of cos  so you may be right  for some reason,btohqsg
all they want faster faster delivery price like begger they even did not notice,btohqsg
It‚Äôs total disregard for riders safety! What a CheapO!,btohqsg
Ohhhh dear‚Ä¶..this dude must be rather new. And he definitely isn‚Äôt in this chat group. On a good note  this scamming issue has gone public  like finally!!,btohqsg

Location 1:1. Fried rice with egg (1)2. Roti prata (2)3. Egg prata (2)4. Mee goreng with egg (1)5. Teh O iced (1),btohqsg

Stay vigilant guys   we delivery drivers already having hard time and have to deal with this type of idiots,btohqsg
Actually just follow what is stated by llm. Ask the customer to pay u 1st for the purchase b4 buying. If they say no then cancel. Simple as that,btohqsg
