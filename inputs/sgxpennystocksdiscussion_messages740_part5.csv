Sia cannot make it then cham curry,btohqsg
Extracted from the writeup:-However  SIA might be forced to inject another S$880 million later if the Indian carrier decides to tap both its shareholders for additional funds for restructuring and expansion.This amount is payable only after the completion of the merger in March 2024. In October  Air India has already announced that it wants to triple its current fleet of 113 aircraft to 300 over the next five years.With the latest additional $360 million in Air India  SIA would have invested almost $1.3 billion in its India airline venture. This could rise to as much as $2.1 billion  should it have to provide funds for the enlarged Air India.However  he avoided mentioning that SIA‚Äôs participation in the Indian airline industry has been loss-making thus far. Analysts were also doubtful if SIA could get back its returns eventually.For example  investment houses like Credit Suisse believe it could take some time before SIA‚Äôs stake in the enlarged Air India generates a sustainable positive return on investment. How long a time it would take is anybody‚Äôs guess. One has to take note that many of the more than 10 000 staff inside Air India are still used to their old way of thinking while making losses for more than a decade.In any case  if SIA does not have enough funds to inject into its India airline venture at any time  it could always launch a new rights issue to raise more funds from its shareholders.https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2022/12/01/sia-injects-another-s360m-into-india-airline-venture-while-st-cheers-who-dares-wins/,btohqsg
