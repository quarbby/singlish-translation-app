Double yellow line $70Zig zag line $120,btohqsg
Walou@SGCM_adminwhy sensor F-K sia can't even write chassis code for latest current Civic Type R,btohqsg
Cause this is a Mazda chat 🤪,btohqsg
Cuz short form for vulgar mah…,btohqsg
Did you just offended all 2012 to 2020 Civic owners saying their car is vulgar? 🤭,btohqsg
New Civic chassis code is FE for sedan and FL for 5 door fastback,btohqsg
Hahaha ofc not. Just so happens the code coincides with a vulgarity,btohqsg
Finally found this diecast model after searching for so long!,btohqsg
Yea next time I pose it together with me. haha,btohqsg
wow ... once in a lifetime chance one will get to see this orichi,btohqsg
enjoy man  1302 quite rare nowadays haha,btohqsg
That diecast is also 1302  which makes it so hard to find this 2 model-year only beetle. 😅,btohqsg
I was saying in jest. You know what I mean. 🤭,btohqsg
Y’all are the top most engaging members that’s why y’all won urself a prize!,btohqsg

Cam car driver claims the role of the victim after cutting recklessly into a Subaru WRX’s lane and receiving 7 brake checks in responseOne does not simply cut a Subaru WRX STI. It is a rule😳➡️ React with 🤬 if you think the cam car deserved the brake checks from the WRX driver!➡️ React with 🤔 if you think both drivers should be ashamed of their actions!Read the full story👉🏻https://bit.ly/3Lk654V,btohqsg
I love this statement; One does not simply cut a Subaru WRX STI!,btohqsg
Eh sia la. So many app notifications from our competitor.,btohqsg
corvette is under Chevrolet rite... damn rare here never saw b4,btohqsg
Chevy RHD market is quite small,btohqsg
Also their gearbox tech is very old and their forte is big engines and big cars as per the middle eastern and north American markets. These vehicles don't do too well in Asian markets usually. Sometimes a few models do decent like the Cruze but the company didn't update it enough so they died,btohqsg
big cc is a killer here... rd tax so exp. Europe aso.. that's y small cars are more common on the streets there.,btohqsg
Just watched the video  the Polestar 2 is driver seat is actually suppose be set abit closer and higher for it to be more comfortable. the seat mold would actually not made to be sat so far like in the video where the seat looked quite far away from the steering wheel.,btohqsg
the traditional american car makers all like that... ford tried to enter the european eco market but too late,btohqsg
despite the newer ford focus being quite good,btohqsg
in Europe smaller cars are common more because of the congestion charges and space constraints as most need to park by the road most of the time,btohqsg
Ford is actually doing quite well in Europe,btohqsg
with the focus  transit and fiesta,btohqsg
well is subjective  on the  road you still see mostly european  brands though,btohqsg
The Kia Sportage and Ford Puma are actually two of the top 3 selling cars in the UK,btohqsg
But I agree  VAG cars do rule the european markets  tend to see them more,btohqsg
many keep them for a longer time as maintenance is cheaper there,btohqsg
in italy and france their own brands also see more loyalty from their nationals,btohqsg
Ford Focus is actually a European product  not US lol,btohqsg
pretty sure some Kia and Hyundai models also being made in europe,btohqsg
but why huh. wouldn't it be cheaper to produce in Korea,btohqsg
or they produce in Eastern Europe. cheaper...,btohqsg
Hyundai also producing EV in Sg ... I aso duno why...,btohqsg
Cause our goverment tried hard to get them here to produce ev so got job for sinkie,btohqsg
Then sinkie will said down with foreigner,btohqsg
When they build the cars here there will be investment in R&D,btohqsg
French drivers as defined by top gear 😂😂😂 the citroens and Peugeots,btohqsg
Produce in Korea and send to Europe hard cause of import taxes  because of the higher volumes  actually cheaper to produce in Europe,btohqsg
Like BMW  Mercedes  etc. have factories in the US and Mexico instead of sending over from Germany,btohqsg
some models of Hyundai in Sg are actually made in Europe,btohqsg
yuppp because they are primarily european market models,btohqsg
the tucson and i30 I believe,btohqsg
Most Audi models also made in Hungary,btohqsg
wah 2021 tucson is bestseller model for  hyundai worldwide haha,btohqsg
For the more mass market ones coming to Singapore  like the Q3  e-Tron in Belgium and Q5 SB in Mexico,btohqsg
the old one quite a bit! the new gen a bit harder to sell plus most go for the forester,btohqsg
yeah those people buying SUV tend to gravitate towards toyota rather than korean brands,btohqsg

passat never facelift for a number of years liao right,btohqsg
nevermind that's the new generation... the front didn't change much,btohqsg
Apparently got a facelift in Jan 2021...,btohqsg
Passat like a very cold car   rarely seen on the road   chances of seeing a Passat is like a Ferrari,btohqsg
too bad they stopped selling arteon,btohqsg
it looked much sportier than passat  and had like 280hp,btohqsg
normal ppl who buy bigger sedan normally go for the normal 3 brands or lexus toyota,btohqsg
but this looks like cherry logo,btohqsg
Because of the number of PHV?,btohqsg
no real creativity in logo design,btohqsg
I am looking at this chart   and Porsche outsold Nissanhttps://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/who_we_are/statistics_and_publications/statistics/pdf/M03-Car_Regn_by_make.pdf,btohqsg
Thank you! Where do I go to collect my prize? 🥶🥶🥶,btohqsg
Depends on who you ask here sir.,btohqsg
Others might say BYD  Tesla and Polestar 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
I based on what I see on road...😂😂. everywhere is Merc BMW Audi Audi maybe slightly lesser,btohqsg
That lone triumph is probably a classic car. Lol,btohqsg
To replace your blue e92 👀,btohqsg
Who knows what is the COE price today later. Thanks,btohqsg
Poor or even lack of low carbon strategy is exactly what quite a few of us here have been talking about. And again  I’m not necessarily saying Teslas or EV are bad. But to say go buy EVs if you want to do your part for the environment is not a great one to say the least because the carbon footprint that goes into making an EV or generating the electricity for it might not be better than an ICE vehicle as many studies have shown  including the ones which Mr@arnavgulianihas shared.,btohqsg
From a share investment perspective  coming down from a high of $1200 to about $700 today  it might not mean it is not a good stock to buy today,btohqsg
Especially on a long term perspective,btohqsg
if pierce thru 600.. all hell will break loose,btohqsg
Does your E92 M3 come with a beautiful GT wing too?,btohqsg
Won’t lah won’t lah. He will go twit or something to generate some hype,btohqsg
I just buy and accumulate hehe,btohqsg

The art of road hogging   even try to accelerate  but car too slowhttps://fb.watch/d5sV1Ee3xw/,btohqsg
The porsche could've just gone honestly. cam car probably didn't see him coming and he moved out of the way after completing his overtake,btohqsg
Porsche angry that the cam car don’t want give way and still want to accelerate by trying to block him,btohqsg
Cam car angry not able to block Porsche as Porsche is very fast   so post video,btohqsg
both in the wrong  but porsche could've let it go as a mistake,btohqsg
no need to rage so much  later the cam car brake check him and his car in the shop for months cause of parts availability,btohqsg
But the Porsche bully a little too much la   just bully him a few time in acceleration will do   and let the cam car know he is slow car will do   too over lol,btohqsg
I mean  if you still need to let him know you're a slow then quite sad  just move on after flashing your lights can already  have porsche lah  can be classy about it,btohqsg
Some time ppl with performance car   just want others to know Thier place   like your car so slow still try to accelerate and block me   u think too much bro,btohqsg
Or it like my car is better and faster   just get lost,btohqsg
sorry to say ah  that one very few people only  most drivers don't care  they are there to enjoy their own car not show off. Those who do that a bit Small .... energy,btohqsg
Ya la I just speculating ma,btohqsg
Usually just let go and continue la.,btohqsg
yeah  someone needs to be the bigger person always,btohqsg
The one time I got really annoyed is at traffic junction  on the lane you can go straight or turn right  those want to turn right ALWAYS dont wanna use indicator.,btohqsg
I always enjoy looking at ppl fight at lane 1,btohqsg
I will slow down at lane 2 for the tail gate car to cut,btohqsg
Battle of the road hogger vs ego car,btohqsg
Worst  the traffic junction is a dictated red->yellow->green turn right light.,btohqsg
this one I agree  very annoying but now that you're in the lane no choice  maybe just lower the window and signal them to use blinkers. People will never learn  can only try,btohqsg
This is common I bet they are laughing in the car  as managed to troll the guy behind,btohqsg
but no point raging also  waste your own energy only,btohqsg
Some horn they will turn on signal. The one I faced that time  a pickup  act blur somemore. Irritating AF,btohqsg
I thought you're the road hogger mah?,btohqsg
Yes but I like to disturb road hogger,btohqsg
I enjoy seeing them accelerate to block me,btohqsg
so you are the road hogger and like to disturb road hoggers as well?,btohqsg
then you kena stuck at the junction behind them max sian-ness,btohqsg
Or 3rd usually I am behind heavy vehicles,btohqsg
But I am not those hogger that will accelerate when ppl trying over take me   I will slow down for them,btohqsg
try not to do this. Esp if the vehicle carrying sand or small stones. Will crack your windshield,btohqsg
Then they will show the thumb up sign,btohqsg
I intend to keep a record of the videos of other motorist wind down Thier windows and show me thumbUp sign,btohqsg
No wonder my bonnet got so many stone chip,btohqsg
yuppp  windshield cracks are a pin,btohqsg
Actually u don’t underestimate the appreciation other will show when they know u give way to them,btohqsg
A lot of time u can see some car trying change lane but can’t   when they know u deliberately slow down for them some is really very appreciative and will show thumbUp to you,btohqsg
tried already  I usually use my hazard flick to show appreciation,btohqsg
But people get scared and slam their brakes at times,btohqsg
not everyone knows about this practice,btohqsg
Yeah  which is why hard to use it all the time  don't wanna cause a pile up behind,btohqsg
Guess you can do it if it's clear behind,btohqsg
Especially in merging lane so many driver like fighting for championship,btohqsg
I can never drive behind heavy vehicles. Especially for cabrios,btohqsg
Many people forgotten about alternate cars when merging.,btohqsg
It is basically see who floor on the accelerator first these days when merging,btohqsg
Where to find these kind of people will thumbs up when i give way sia  i also want...Would like some validation and appreciation for following the road rules too thx,btohqsg
I was sandwiched in between 3 of them at a junction recently  not something I'd like to experience again,btohqsg
That very rude actually like q cutting,btohqsg
Yea la  the more@SGCM_Adminshould share video of good deeds rather than keep sharing videos from SGRV. 😪,btohqsg
Last time SGRV shares videos meant for learning lesson. Now any stupid video also upload. Waste of time and data.,btohqsg
U try give way more time sure got some 1 will do that to you,btohqsg
SGRV attracts the wrong crowd 😂  now macham online vilifying platform,btohqsg
I drive a 90s shitbox that can barely maintain 80kmh.I give way all the time 😂,btohqsg
No choice but to give way for you,btohqsg
Yes! I proposed that once earlier too,btohqsg
Later they run over your car and don't realize,btohqsg
My car older than yours lolNext time I give way to you.,btohqsg
Thank you sir i will give you big thumbs up,btohqsg
That's actually an innate fear now  since my area alot of heavy vehicles 😂,btohqsg
Don’t know when our expressway will be 110 km like Malaysia,btohqsg
Yes unfortunately alot don't. They live in their own world where they are the only car on the road 😂,btohqsg
Won't happen la...already so many feel unsafe at 90 so hog lane 1 at 70+...Jin jialat,btohqsg
Ideally zipper system.Reality see who car have higher torque.,btohqsg
Might be the same for me soon 🙌,btohqsg
some drivers are really taking their own sweet time but logically once they hit the merge they should go ahead even if they are real slow,btohqsg
Ya la all are lorry driver,btohqsg
Forgive leh  sometimes uphill  not because going slow but vehicle not enough power.Then Taxi floor and zoom by lol,btohqsg
Plus the expressways quite bumpy because of the tree roots at times,btohqsg
Honda is awesome. I think the older S800 is super cool. A car with motorbike sound,btohqsg

Old car doesn't matter if you're looking for driving experience over having computers,btohqsg
Most cars new these days are already drive by wire,btohqsg
I was referring more to the infotainment  adaptive cruise control etc.,btohqsg
Just priorities  some people like those features more than the driving experience of the car so depends on personal preference,btohqsg
Actually many quite reliable if maintained well,btohqsg
As long as you do your preventive maintenance  I've heard of brand new Mercedes and Hondas being down in the workshop for a longer time than older cars a lot,btohqsg
Obviously nothing faster than your Tesla no need maintanence one,btohqsg
Depent ba   I believe a lot of new car owner is just what a transport and hassle free   first 5 years no problem1 at most battery got provlem,btohqsg
To each of it Ken need ba,btohqsg
Yeah really depends on how the person maintains it  that's why important to look at multiple units. Can compromise on a few things like interior colour  spec etc. But good unit with good maintanence most important,btohqsg
Like my friend family man buy a new sienta   reliable   comfortable and hassle free for first 5 year for sure   old cars can be cranky and not as comfortable as new la,btohqsg
He just want a car don’t give him problem so can fecth his kids,btohqsg
Old car is value for money   but knowledge in car   and effort to spent in maintenance is a must 1,btohqsg
Depends what kind of old car also  a lot of old Toyota no problem  can run for 100s of thousands,btohqsg
Hondas also  just need a decent workshop that knows what they're doing and don't scam you,btohqsg
what downtime repair? mine is 6 year old mazda. zero repair,btohqsg
get a good used car. people like to assume old is bad.,btohqsg
why pay exorbitant amount of money when a good used one is good. just dont get e30 that is too old.,btohqsg
U are different la   you know about cars   and can repair   a lot of ppl buy 2nd hand car very scare of lemon and such   for piece of mind some ppl buy a new car to fecth kid lol,btohqsg
get a 5 year old 6 year old check history and records. you will get a bargain.,btohqsg
as good as new like my mazda. why> the ex owner seldom drives. and comes with full service history,btohqsg
this one is over worrying.  if you start by buying a used one you will change your mind.,btohqsg
Ya  mine was 5 yrs old when I traded in… no issue,btohqsg
Heng suay lah. Nth is perfect u get good one u will praise until u get a bad one.,btohqsg
exactly. after i got my mazda  my friend asked me to sell to him. he loved it so much. and it is incredible bargain and savings. people always assume that people sell away their cars because car has problems. thatis not true at all. people have different needs and priorities. or financial needs. etc,btohqsg
Also Depent on your car knowledge   I know ppl don’t even go petrol kiosk pump tyre,btohqsg
U ask them maintain car   u kill them ba,btohqsg
I got friend drive yellow engine light for long till become red,btohqsg
And don’t know what is that,btohqsg
I really dk it can change colour LOL,btohqsg

No correlation. Tesla is now going downwards becoz of all the right wing tweets that Elon Musk mentioned. Better go read up first. It’s investor confidence issue alr.,btohqsg
nth wrong leh media and public being so soft and sensitive,btohqsg
they never see manual car before  so when they see someone shifting or noisy manual car they think it’s racing,btohqsg
Yea I wanna lash out this. The journalism and article is so bad. Even Stomp can have better articles.Tons of biasness and stereotyping on car enthusiast,btohqsg

Its fun that Audi e-tron and Poorsche Taycan is essentially the same platform,btohqsg
Think he wasn't really going fast,btohqsg
Just video driving a legendary car doesn't make him irresponsible,btohqsg
VW Porsche Audi Skoda Seat all share platform and certain parts... interchangeable...,btohqsg
Check out the brembo and rotors,btohqsg
I think he will sure win everyone on the 100-0,btohqsg
Pretty much how EVs will work in the future. Companies will develop one platform and the body  suspension and interior will be all that's different and power limits basis pricing. It'll be more of a coach building method over completely new development with a few key players who will develop platforms like Tesla  Rimac  Rivian  VAG and others,btohqsg
Certain models don’t .. so must do the homework and even if so  there is frequently some badging tax to be paid 😁😁,btohqsg
Rivian is already using their skateboard platform for the pickup truck and SUV,btohqsg
Yup  I noticed! Are the rims BBS?,btohqsg
Yes I talk with ppl like such before   they said can’t win You in acceleration   but can try to win you in braking distance,btohqsg
Like how I’m the most handsome man in my bedroom.,btohqsg
Actually this is the most important upgrade hahah,btohqsg
But to me just get a good tyre will do and maintain the tyre well,btohqsg
yeah not all. but hearsay Bentley n Porsche share parts too😂,btohqsg
Most important upgrade regardless of the car?🤔,btohqsg
Must have combo lah.. like Street Fighter. Tyre plus decent brakes mah,btohqsg
I have no idea what brand is that…😅,btohqsg
The design seems to be a bbs replica,btohqsg
now trend is to buy replica from china,btohqsg
You got Regen also to help  ice cars engine braking not so much for all of them,btohqsg
Might not only be about that I feel.,btohqsg
Driving pattern and habit also ba   for my Driving pattern just a good tyre will do as I don’t tail gate,btohqsg
Honestly very dangerous  a few potholes at higher speed and boom  rim bent or cracked,btohqsg
Which.. starts to beg the question.. what else could be a replica..,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just like the looks   u also know those sticker   replica and painted brakes caliber,btohqsg
I prefer to look at the tyre   if I see it like use ps4s I know he is serious guy,btohqsg
And that’s all good. As long as one doesn’t start to get into his head that he is now driving a performance ride and…,btohqsg
True! PS4 tyres no replicas right?😂,btohqsg
Yup actually is always is the driving method not about the car,btohqsg
I’ve seen China cf kits on 488s before. Or reps rims on RR  or K tyres on Bentleys,btohqsg
Tires hard to get replicas in Singapore  just need to keep in mind old tires with super old date of manufacture,btohqsg
Tyre got replica one meh? Wth,btohqsg
Replica this is really professional poser liao,btohqsg
ya tyre very exp meh need buy replica🤔,btohqsg
Got. Not really a replica but a copied design.The latest victim we are know is Russia when they used China copy of Michelin military tyres. It did not end well for the Russians.,btohqsg
Ya at most 175 per tyre.,btohqsg
Used to la before all the inflation nonsense.,btohqsg
i ask mine is around 600 plus for 1,btohqsg
Now I think is what  230?,btohqsg
Erm yes leh.. it’s all relative dude. Try making enquiry for a ps4s 23” on a Lux SUV,btohqsg
No la. Per tyre leh. 17”,btohqsg
I actually like Malaysian made Continental tyres,btohqsg
ya the price jump is so scary lol,btohqsg

Thanks Soon Ng! Shall read it later,btohqsg
Yellow Sea YS20  copy of Michelin XZL tyres haha,btohqsg
can afford a luxury SUV or sedan. tyre price should be the last thing on their mind😂,btohqsg
Depends on the size you are looking for actually,btohqsg
i trying to find this tyre  any 1 got any tips?https://press.pirelli.com/new-pirelli-p-zero-elect-tyres-for-the-all-electric-bmw-ix-bavarian-flagship/,btohqsg
Also depends on profile and the cross section you are looking for not just the rim size,btohqsg
Not very easily available yet  even outside Singapore very hard to find as they're very new on the market. Maybe wait a few months  can contact a few tire suppliers and check if they will bring them over in the near future,btohqsg
WA piang 600 per tyre is really super expensive.,btohqsg
Yup I ask a few liao all said don’t have   currently I am on these tyre   but one tyre shop tell me that it might cost over 800 for each tyre,btohqsg
I think the chopper is big this time,btohqsg
Yeah supply very low cause new tire that's why  PS5s also super expensive right now because demand is high,btohqsg
Plus for this tire  the initial supply all the manufacturers buy already so direct consumer really gets to pick from a much smaller lot,btohqsg
17 inches relatively cheaper across the board because smaller plus much higher demand so production is scaled accordingly as 17 to 18 inches are the most common stock wheel dimensions,btohqsg
Anyone here uses the tourador thingy tyres. I still wouldn't want to trust MIC tyres for now.,btohqsg
Now there's a few more like them  rydanz and one more I've seen recently,btohqsg
i am looking at this p zero tyre  i see the price i am like woo hoohttps://www.monotaro.sg/p/18636723.html?utm_id=google_pla_sg&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQJqF1013QuO_ovRPrOCN44KQxeU6L8XmQBcG0Fh8EyckpmtPoWi0UEaAtnhEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQJqF1013QuO_ovRPrOCN44KQxeU6L8XmQBcG0Fh8EyckpmtPoWi0UEaAtnhEALw_wcB,btohqsg
I am picky on tires. Cos for my car it is just literally me  my steering wheel and the tyres,btohqsg
Yeah makes complete sense no electronics at all. But I feel tires should be one thing that no one should cheap out on  because they're your only point of contact with the roads,btohqsg
15 incher is still very economical today. What a long sightedness that VW foresee when it was first designed way back in early 1940s,btohqsg
I am actually very happy with Malaysia continental made Dunlop SP Sports J5.,btohqsg
"even tho it was an ""economy sports"" tire lol",btohqsg
This size fits murcielagos  Corvette rears  vipers  etc.,btohqsg
I think for you  the stability and wet weather capabilities are the top priority! Economy sports segment tires tend to do really well with that,btohqsg
Considering the car isn't meant to be a performance car anyway,btohqsg
They usually don’t bring these special tyres to Singapore and even if have  will be $$$.,btohqsg
Ya how my tyre can last me 1 more year lol,btohqsg
Then these stock should arrive liao,btohqsg
Yup  designed for wet.They have a wet indicator. If that is worn  it is time to replace; while it will still perform good in dry,btohqsg
Try asking for a 295/40-22 ps4s,btohqsg
With the price hike and limited supply  I heard $1k+ each also can’t get even if you’re willing to pay for it.,btohqsg
Can consider group buy with other electric vehicle owners,btohqsg
Might bring the price down a bit,btohqsg
Kana side wall nail is really heart pain,btohqsg
15 inch is considered big in 1940s,btohqsg
I see those old RR from that era also use small wheels,btohqsg
Change ur rim to this to pair with the tyres,btohqsg
Not sure they provide at SEAT or Skoda pricing?,btohqsg
Well not all parts are interchangeable usually it's the platforms and a few things only,btohqsg
Part price from a stockist can be similar but the major difference you see is when you go to a dealer to do it and they charge you extra for the part and labour,btohqsg
same parts put in a Toyota box Vs one in a lexus box could be big difference,btohqsg

if you compare A3 to Scala  the most apple to apple comparision you can get on the market right now,btohqsg
A3 197k  Scala top variant at 151k,btohqsg
Golf in the middle at 169 to 179k,btohqsg
imagine a SEAT at 149  I used to drive the SEAT that cost less than 50K... of course times have changed  now the SEAT and my Golf almost on par except some features and the interior materials are better quality looking for the Golf,btohqsg
You are a wise man. We remember our painful experiences.,btohqsg
NIO is going big and they will have stations to replace your car's battery in less tha few minutes instead of having to wait for charging time with a minimum wait of 35mins,btohqsg
Exactly  times have changed  there is demand for each and every one of them. there are minute differences in the materials and features but the difference in price is a lot more  20k between the Golf and the Leon. You just have to pick and choose what you want to pay for and what you consider value for money,btohqsg
haha i think tesla market share too big for NIO to be popular here,btohqsg
unless NIO themselves can come in without any markup from AD  i think it wld be tough,btohqsg
Tesla hype train will still be around to give them tough competition,btohqsg
really depends on how they can price here too and what kind of market identity they can create,btohqsg
Or course la. You’re so slow surely braking distance you win,btohqsg
If this is fitted on beetle heads turn,btohqsg
imagine if you have these rims on a toyota century,btohqsg
Beetle needs to be in metallic gold colour first lol,btohqsg
i sold NIO last year warned others not to buy but sell,btohqsg
is this orderable in singapore? damn cool.,btohqsg
You can register interest but no deliveries,btohqsg
In general the new model X deliveries are delayed  especially the plaid,btohqsg
Yes but that's import used and still won't get the updated model with the landscape screen like model 3. Will be the older one plus no supercharging,btohqsg

i dont do if buts and maybes  i do absolutes. and subie slander are all based on facts😈😈,btohqsg
is this a good buy comparable with megane?,btohqsg
megane 1.8 so i personally feel is better haha,btohqsg
Yes simple thing like tyre rotation   change brake fluid and aircon can be done outside   scare is bms  battery or motor need claim warrently then alibaba liao,btohqsg
Cause they won’t give u any warrently and reject alll service   so u need to sent back to to the country that u purchase from,btohqsg
👍🏼 yes sir same here more reliable and easier to find parts too,btohqsg
well depends what the buyer wants if you ask me.You want a  good handling car to go to the track  for sure megane rs.You want a car that will comfortably sit a family of 5 that is pretty fast  than giulia veloce will be more suitable,btohqsg
It really depends on what the buyer wants,btohqsg
1.8 road tax low solid choice there,btohqsg
if you wanna sit workshop everyday  buy subie,btohqsg
And how deep is your pocket,btohqsg
oh light car  but not bad,btohqsg
now megane is no more. renault sports no more back to alpine,btohqsg
If you have a warranty claim cannot do here easily  or anything goes wrong with the screen or motors,btohqsg
erm... you mean the Alfa sir? wahahahahahaha,btohqsg
HAHA this gen alfa i think shld be btr... hopefully,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1076158i saw a yellow one in KL. gorgeous looks. unique and head turner,btohqsg
But the family can only sit for a few months a year?,btohqsg
Other times the car in workshop?,btohqsg
agreed man... if you got deep pockets  just buy both,btohqsg
Just haven't call the tow truck,btohqsg
renault megane rs reliable? what is running cost like,btohqsg
Joking joking  but I agree  the megane seems more value for money to me and more fun to run around in,btohqsg
TGIF  everybody is so free to talk cars,btohqsg
uhh it depends... you cant really compare to the giulia because it just doesnt serve the same function,btohqsg
notice all of us not even comparing brochure numbers.,btohqsg
who else but china that can design such fugly cars,btohqsg
if you track the megane RS alot  for sure your maint cost is gonna be much higher compared to a giulia!,btohqsg
Not too bad from what I've heard  of course if you go bonkers with tuning and hardware changes  will sacrifice reliability,btohqsg
But it is also possible that the Giulia never reaches the track right Mr Xun?,btohqsg
i also tracked alfa a few times and maintenance is nothing unusual.,btohqsg
Mr X  you have a blue e92 m3 right!,btohqsg
quality giulia is much much better  renault never has the lux feeling. it is like subaru or nissan kinda feel,btohqsg
I saw one the other day and wondered if it was you!,btohqsg
if you daily  its pretty reliable. parts are relatively cheap too.. but they are sometimes hard to source,btohqsg
no leh gna have to stop you there  the new renaults are pretty nice inside,btohqsg
Just depends on how you maintain the cars honestly  if you take care of them and don't abuse them. Stay on top of preventive maintenance  you'll probably be fine because very little room for error in Singapore apart from not following preventive maintenance and mods,btohqsg
ok. that is what i want to know. daily use.,btohqsg
the mk4 megane rs in the ad actually has a really solid interior with a good infotainment system too,btohqsg
your kids might be driving something like this in the near future,btohqsg
well megane rs are really track cars haha or weekend cars,btohqsg
i used to track alfa many times  and it is like nothing and use it daily. no repair,btohqsg
the mk4 for sure more refined then the rest though not as hard core,btohqsg
if you daily a megane rs at 45  high chance you will be without a tailbone by the age of 50,btohqsg
Base Renault's you might feel that like a base Clio or megane. But actually nowadays quite nice. I personally feel the new grand scenic and all very nice. Megane RS of course has a lot of alcantara and premium materials also,btohqsg
the mk3 very stiff i see the car on the road back pain alr,btohqsg
never. a/c worked year after year.,btohqsg
but my friends who seldom use the car developed more problems,btohqsg
nice! must be blessed by the italian gods,btohqsg
seems the more i use it the better,btohqsg
many ont know alfa well. they get jjudements based on hearsay,btohqsg
no. mine is never modded. no extra skirts etc,btohqsg
how different is yours from that one?,btohqsg
Is yours the LCI or Pre LCI@Cxspeed,btohqsg
okay to a certain extent you are right. i wouldnt say much much btr but marginally better. after all i dont think anybody will care about whether its made of plastic or leather when you are going 200 through eau rouge on spa francorchamp,btohqsg
Very true with Italian cars sometimes,btohqsg
eh how to disable this irritating slow mode?,btohqsg
exactly... slow is not our thing right,btohqsg
newer ones should be quite ok.  but older ones using selespeed need more tender loving care,btohqsg
you like it fast mr anwo?😋😋,btohqsg
"my car is so good and light that my friend swapped his car with mine for a week.  he asked me to ""thrash"" his to make it better! lol",btohqsg
such a dream.. can you share with us a pic minus license plate? how does it compare with that earlier pic?,btohqsg
actually since 2000  alfa cars under Fiat are better. really. i kid you no. mine is one of the few 5 with highest mileage and yet best fuel economy. long distance. very optimized and fuel saving. always well taken care for with nothing but just good synthetics oils,btohqsg
all your cars seem like mechanical nirvana for many of us. I will buy your car tomorrow if you want to sell man,btohqsg
i didnt tune anything special either. no mods. just good oils change and high speed drive. fastest to kl 1 hour 50 minutes sg  besi toll,btohqsg
you are spot on. when i sold my car  that car didnt test my car at all. he asked me to open the bonnet. took a look at it and checked the inside and out and offered me on the spot!,btohqsg
anybody who buys my car will have a good car. i am such a car lover!,btohqsg
which workshop do you go to for that m3?,btohqsg
this one is modifed with wie flared wheel arch. mine isnt,btohqsg
well  you pull up the e92 m3 competition pack car with the CSL wheels Y spoke that will be the one. i like the original look and stance and thus i dont other to modify anything. i am a driver  i aint showy with LEDs or wheels,btohqsg
Give us a hint give us a hint  we promise not to kaypoh and go see,btohqsg
for my Alfa  i also didnt modify  the only thing i did is lowered suspension with eibach and sachs,btohqsg
i love the megane rs look. it really looks special,btohqsg
what made you modify that one?,btohqsg
giulia also look v nice haha  it has always been on my radar after seeing a review where so many italian quirks are infused into the car,btohqsg
the holding of downshift paddle and the car will auto downshift to the lowest gear etc,btohqsg
or pulling both paddle and going into neutral,btohqsg
"i wont call it mod. i merely made it ""sports"" package offered by Alfa factory which the local dealer did not import. but it is the same as the one in Italy and Germany. i kept it to factory standards using eibach lowered springs and sachs dampers",btohqsg
reminds me of some of the arcade games Mr Xun,btohqsg
with a thicker sway bars  better on track.,btohqsg
however  the car still understeered. front is still heavy. this problem is finally solved with giulia.,btohqsg
so front drive cars i thin honda  megane do much much better than alfa. alfa the front overhang is too long. look at 159. the front is so long,btohqsg
156 is a GT car  not so much for track use,btohqsg
"IMO  the giulia veloce is a ""complete"" car. stylish  good interior  good power  good handling  good looks  good performance and can use on track too and daily",btohqsg
if veloce drops to 100K it is compelling to buy. because i know when i have this i wont change.,btohqsg
that's y it looks good till now.🤣,btohqsg
i akso had the 156 JTS. haha this one you'd better not buy. this is the first Alfa GDI engine car  not dont well. the engine burns oil. and every 3 weeks or so got to add oil otherwise the engine can stave oil and not careful will destroy engine,btohqsg
if i strike 8m toto maybe,btohqsg
aiya not expensive la the car,btohqsg
