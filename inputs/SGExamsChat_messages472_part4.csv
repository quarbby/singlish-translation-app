Moving from A lvl chat  replying toDeepLearningJamI don't source students from the telegram group. I'm here mainly for entertainment  and to help students when I'm free and is something I can help,btohqsg
I was thinking if I wanna get serious about a backup plan then I should try to get back in the flow,btohqsg
I used to help out for free at the now defunct sgforums,btohqsg
But you do tuition or you have a full time job,btohqsg
now I find another channel to help,btohqsg
Micron not worth the effort? Hahaha,btohqsg
But doesn't stop me from wanting to help students. I got my Physics knowledge from SG education system  including olympiad training.,btohqsg
It reached the stage where I was working 80 hours a week as engineer and tutor. So have to choose one,btohqsg
Very admirable  for me it‚Äôs more of wondering if I can keep doing my current job if big disruption happens,btohqsg
Plus I think three years of on call and weekend work idk if I wanna do it any more,btohqsg
I have a friend who was retrenched in 2020 due to covid  till now can't find job,btohqsg
It gets harder once past 40,btohqsg
How did you first start out  it‚Äôs quite gradual and natural for you right since you probably coach and give tuition / teach back all the while?,btohqsg
Then you have contacts and ask if they have anyone who needed to pay for tuition?,btohqsg
I started during NS in year 2002,btohqsg
my then gf and now wife passed 2 students to me that she didn't feel like teaching. Then they referred their cousin who referred here and there until now,btohqsg
Now im curious where to see ah,btohqsg
You have quite the pedigree  does tuition reward you (monetarily) better than if you kept working?,btohqsg
Very strong physics student all the way up to university,btohqsg
Wah bro u r engie god,btohqsg
I don't actually know after covid caused inflation of wages for tech sector.But previously  for the time spent  yes,btohqsg
anybody got grab or foodpanda voucher the subscription one,btohqsg
main difference is the freedom that comes with it. I get to send my kids to childcare every morning  slowly.I get to accompany my parents if they need to  to hospital check ups,btohqsg
Aspirational  thanks for sharing. For me im an SRE and I had too many late nights in the last 3 years  so I‚Äôm a bit worried this is going the career reality for a long time,btohqsg
Even if the job is good honestly after a while I don‚Äôt feel very good,btohqsg
it works when you are younger,btohqsg
I still have my sg foodpanda membership if you want  but i wont be using it for the next 2 years,btohqsg
Site reliability engineer. It‚Äôs the new buzzword they have for DevOps+ Operations It engineer + software engineer + infrastructure engineer,btohqsg
"Problem is I don't know how to sell it also. Many of my students who came to me didn't even know anything about me -.-""But I really just focus on helping who comes for help  so didn't matter alot",btohqsg
Oh and cloud engineer and incident manager all rolled into one,btohqsg
Depends on your workplace your flavor but yeah,btohqsg
It's called all the sai kang,btohqsg
Haha every damn IT job or tech job in Singapore except at tech MNC is like that,btohqsg
I literally have not ever seen any such job say ‚Äúno overtime‚Äù,btohqsg
work that hard  can only do it up to a breaking point,btohqsg
I realise there should be a market for uni universal modules for engineering,btohqsg
different uni different  so not possible,btohqsg
I would totally pay like 150 per hour for hni mods,btohqsg
How has the tuition landscape evolved with time,btohqsg
The last time I had tuition was in 2013 (a levels),btohqsg
nowadays  on top of using my own customised set of materials  I also record all lessons and send to students to follow up,btohqsg
I remember I used to go to Mr Pang or Phang tuition  it‚Äôs very close to Catholic high at the time in bishan,btohqsg
His trick is he has a assignment at the end of the lesson you must complete to leave,btohqsg
I didn't need to. Everything is easy enough,btohqsg
You have a center of your own?,btohqsg
