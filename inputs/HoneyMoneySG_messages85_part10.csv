When u are high income u might hit the $80k tax relief cap. Then u cannot benefit at all from cpf Topup.My alternative view is to Topup your cpf as early in life as possible to start earning 4% pa (transfer all from oa to sa).But that was my era days when interest rates were Low and it made sense to Topup with cash (bank paid 0.5-1% interest vs special account earning 4% pa.Considerations are:1. Do u need your cash2. Do u need your oaBefore u move all oa to sa.,btohqsg
