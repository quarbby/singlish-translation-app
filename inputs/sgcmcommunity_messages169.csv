Pffttt … I cannot get over it,btohqsg
That civic was what I wanted leh!,btohqsg
Loll…how the heck managed to do that,btohqsg
I in same situation. Tivoli looks like best option right now. Got Peugeot and Citroen options in similar price range but many people say dont buy French. Qashqai that 1.2l engine is not sufficient I think.,btohqsg
French cars not common in SG. Want go outside repair or buy parts expensive,btohqsg
Ya but parf car only like 5-8 years old. Got so many problems meh?,btohqsg
5th year onwards is when all the taiji come out one bro.,btohqsg
The extra money you pay for a honda,btohqsg
Oh? I didn’t know. I thought the dig-t engines rarely have issues. Gearbox should be a cvt  I don’t foresee any problems.Of course the 2.0 will run smoother than the 1.2. But cost will be slightly higher.,btohqsg
I heard some car clubs charges admin fees,btohqsg
but never heard of any different cost for Honda,btohqsg
Japanese car in singapore got JDM tax one,btohqsg
I doubt its just for jdm,btohqsg
It’s sg tax applies for all,btohqsg
You tell me which car more overpriced than japanese car,btohqsg
Sg buyers are willing also in some ways,btohqsg
I think porsches are “reasonably” priced,btohqsg
Everything is reasonably price if you put it like that,btohqsg
Got one time got one evo 9,btohqsg

Kia & Hyundai aren't they like sister company lol,btohqsg
The thing about Korean car is that because in the past they tend to have many problem  so many older generation buyer / mechanic still think they sucks,btohqsg
my coe Hyundai has been pretty solid,btohqsg
Recently I think Hyundai have 10 year warranty for their engine for their new car  but people end up thought is because their engine lousy that is why give 10 year warranty 🙃,btohqsg
My friend also say very solid,btohqsg
Shouldn’t it be viewed as Kia is confident that their engine won’t have issues so they dare to guarantee 10yrs. If got issues  they want to chop chop wash hands off it ma,btohqsg
even my korean colleague ask me to avoid Korean cars 🤷,btohqsg
I guess depend how we see it la. Malaysian driver also not too keen on Korean car. I heard the Korean distributor there need to lower the car price and add in more freebies to attract buyer away from Japanese or Malaysian car (myvi  perodua etc..),btohqsg
Their design is damn good though,btohqsg
The recent avante and the new Kona look damn good,btohqsg
Avante still have ? Thought no more,btohqsg
Their Myvi  perodua very cheap there.. JDM tax also exist in Msia.,btohqsg
See the civics also quite ex.,btohqsg
FC not so much though. Best I gotten was 16km/l but most instances is between 10-13km/l,btohqsg
Acceptable la  my 2016 altis now is like 11-12 km/l.,btohqsg

Hmm yea I tapped thru the qashqai 1.2 reviews in the sgcarmart listings... doesn't look good lol,btohqsg
too heavy/too much for the engine,btohqsg
That’s why so many glb200 in the market also,btohqsg
oh ya hor..hardly see any renault on the road nowadays,btohqsg
When problems come… it’s a big headache,btohqsg
Any opinions here on a COE e200? Quite solid cars I thought...or is maintenance/servicing a killer?,btohqsg
I see quite a lot on the road,btohqsg
Every car need see previous owners one,btohqsg
I got see someone need to overhaul their toyota at <150k mileage,btohqsg
You try search online for the parts which commonly need to be replace. Some workshop will put on their website on how much to change some item (wheel bearing  compressor replacement etc). If the price is something you can accept then is ok,btohqsg
If you are in good term with your mwchanic  can ask their opinion also,btohqsg
Don’t believe whatever he says ^,btohqsg
probably not worth it compared to parf tbh,btohqsg
yeah just looking at all options  dont need til Jan-Feb 24,btohqsg
oh is there any additional tax or fee on buying second car? i.e I buy new car Feb  my current car coe expire March,btohqsg
is not like house where you pay absd all that right?,btohqsg
hello   any recommendations on which suv to get for a used car for first timer ?,btohqsg
If budget is not an issue yes  if not get the smaller cross over (Yaris cross) or the in between which is corolla cross.,btohqsg
But those are limited to Toyota la  if want get other brand then got more options,btohqsg
If cross over cannot then only left with harrier or RAV4. I think still can find fortuner also,btohqsg
Ferry my family and friends / working colleagues and also we go shopping often,btohqsg
Sedan boot nicer to store groceries. Is deep enough to put the auntie trolley vertically,btohqsg

What's your budget? I see if got anything good - F,btohqsg
Got minimum coe left? - F,btohqsg
whats the difference? sorry idk haha,btohqsg
Hatchback? The boot space small though,btohqsg
With that kind of budget might as well buy new car  no need to deal with 2nd hand issues,btohqsg
Can go lexus if want premium?,btohqsg
Not the most premium line up la  but more atas than harrier,btohqsg
Every time I see premium car price at this high COE make me think my BTO like cheap,btohqsg
rlly? i always tot harrier was so premium than alot others haha,btohqsg
lol with that kind of budget... You want Cayenne also can sia,btohqsg
I saw tesla too model y haha nt bad bt but empty,btohqsg
Camry very nice  but unfortunately the sales keep going down cause people prefer SUV body than sedan body,btohqsg
SUV also cause tall so can see infront clearer than sedan hahaI always sceptical when turning when driving My mazda 3,btohqsg
Modern SUV still can flip when turning? I see on the road vezel turn damn fast one,btohqsg
Sienta the design is like super subjective sia,btohqsg
Some love it some hate it,btohqsg
cause if nt i every week go jb pump 🤣,btohqsg
Drive conti car don't think of FC,btohqsg
Why though? Isit cause by default most of them are fuel monsters? or,btohqsg
I was told that German manufacturer don't prioritise FC like the Japanese manufacturers. Germans priorities comfort  power and luxury over FC and reliability that the Japanese put above all else,btohqsg
But not all manufacturers like that la  abit stereotype,btohqsg
Your budget can get rs6 left 3 years,btohqsg
lol this is not true... The new VW engines can go 25+km/l on highways...,btohqsg
Ofc la who would nt worry abt that,btohqsg
I think it’s you who’s trolling,btohqsg
thats why they going into EV now due to EU climate change regulations,btohqsg
but i think in the race to EV dominance  chinese/jap brands will be faster than conti la,btohqsg
Toyota like slow when it come to EV  maybe Chinese brand will be the 1st,btohqsg
In china the adoption rate for EV very higg,btohqsg
"probably because EV cars are ""easier"" to maintain  though infra reliance is a big negative. but since China is China  infra can be easily built (or faked lol)",btohqsg

But all those are smaller SUV,btohqsg

Cannot repair first and reimburse later?,btohqsg
say got to wait for the third party insurance to admit liability and then after repair  wait for their surveyor to take pic,btohqsg

Yah THIS THE ISWARAN SAY IN PALIARMENT ONE,btohqsg
There are a LOT of issues with this motor insurance in Singapore,btohqsg

Then now ppl found Loophole dont report can liao,btohqsg
Then when civil suit cry father cry mother,btohqsg

How much u pay for insurance?,btohqsg
car can drive or in workshop,btohqsg
oh then claim loss of use gao gao,btohqsg
latest update is they are repairing,btohqsg
Insurer will keep denying payment mo,btohqsg
Maybe she nv use her insurance workshop that why so slow,btohqsg
i'm the middle one... i think a lot of workshops are hungry for third party claim ba,btohqsg
Actually if someone bang me i wonder how they gna repair my car,btohqsg
If not you can use your insurer to expedite fast fast,btohqsg
Cus my kit change n car is wrap,btohqsg
Must find a wrap ws somemore,btohqsg
I think your 1 can claim Gao Gao,btohqsg
If wrap   need to inform LTA?,btohqsg
Coz the information in one motoring will be different,btohqsg
Then if people hit and run can say different color car from one motoring,btohqsg
"Cause you are ""not changing to body color"" you are protecting it",btohqsg

So jialat sia  didn't know motor insurance like that. I thought will be the typical victim claim from their own insurance  then insurance will claim with one another,btohqsg
I’ve been like holing up at home ever since 🙄,btohqsg
Really no car damn difficult to survive,btohqsg
The gia said actually lol...claim own insurance first then have the insurance company file a claim against opposite party,btohqsg
The other approach is of course the above,btohqsg
Most important is you got submit report within 24hrs of the accident,btohqsg
Take grab...avoid car sharing cos not worth the risk,btohqsg
Should always go to your authorised ws unless opposite party pte settlement...,btohqsg
Claim daily expenses also cos owning a car dun use also incur expenses e.g. parking  loan etc,btohqsg
The only way is to when accident happens  demand a copy of insurance from the other party involved in the accident. In fairness you will share yours as well  so both of you will know each other have a valid insurance.Reason: You can never assumed the other party involved in accident have a valid insurance.,btohqsg

Protip: always have a good friend or family member who are more wellverse in this situation. When in accident  call him/her. A calm person will be able to give a detailed steps on how to deal with it since it is normal for a person met in accident (esp first time) to be fluttered.,btohqsg
i think i should just hang up my licence already,btohqsg
"the workshop telling me ""Hi  we will try our best to get the liability with our best ability. Usually digging the liability out from the claims handler will take awhile.""",btohqsg
Call your insurer  they will assign people to come down to access at the accident site,btohqsg
My previous car also like that . But the repair part takes a little longer . Coz need to fly in from oversea .,btohqsg
Or ask your insurer if they can take over from here since the Ws not doing much,btohqsg
I am sure all the documentation have already been taken down,btohqsg

Take photo show us the voucher,btohqsg
Experienced driver will say doesn't matter  but many new drivers will mind if the body count is too many.,btohqsg
If got service history I dont mind so much,btohqsg
Not many places offer that though. Sometimes people also skeptical if the seller falsify it or not,btohqsg
Best is if you can bring the vehicle for your mechanic to check,btohqsg

Which brand you use! Driveshaft just straight change to CF one!,btohqsg
Why thinner oil ah? Keep same grade change to high quality one more better sometimes they tell me,btohqsg
Oh interesting what sounds like a scam  that I gave an opinion saying people should be patient? Huh,btohqsg
You think is funny? Your behaviour is out of character,btohqsg
Maybe we should go about reporting everyone's text then  perhaps that will make you happy,btohqsg
What I said is simple and true and lots of people who can relate will understand that just because a trade is moving badly and they are at a loss at the moment doesn't mean it won't go back to bring profits,btohqsg
You're laughing  as long as an individual analysis is accurate and the trade should bring profits in little or no time which I said earlier that it takes patience to achieve that,btohqsg
So next time  read through a text before condemning and being all judgemental about it  do you understand,btohqsg
Higher grade? Can share the brand?,btohqsg
U think I give 2 shits about ur long texts? 0 so okay Bye ☺️,btohqsg
fat chance  but I hope some dealers will offer guaranteed COE at 10XXXX,btohqsg
Woah. My msg is in 3rd person,btohqsg
