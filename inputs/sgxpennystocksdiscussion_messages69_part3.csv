Really didn‚Äôt hope for this for today . But still the BBs did it nonetheless.,btohqsg
i understand....one bro posted what u wrote in the MT chat group so i just came here to let u know don‚Äôt take it too hard. BB also will have their own chartist to disiao one,btohqsg
This are some of the scenarios.  Being an observer and a player  lot of expectations.,btohqsg
Panic sets in ppl start selling cutting losses etc. Manipulated by the BB,btohqsg
Ya...when I saw the action just now...can imagine those who chased in the opening bell this morning....quite unexpected.,btohqsg
Ya...we shall remain guided by your charts. No worries....we also have to dyodd as well.,btohqsg
1st time experience...really eye opener to mean and a bad experience as well,btohqsg
Me too Aunty never seen such show before except in movies  numbers really run down drain so quickly before my eyes wow  I learnt something today! Anyway if Medtecs really think price is unjustified they may shares buyback upwards,btohqsg
Just take TG scenario when they resumed trading after recent results announcementBut TG climbed back up after BBs flushed the weak hands  caused panic selling etc and are trading higher from that pointI believe the same shall happen for Medtecs with time.Positive üôèüèª,btohqsg
Now I am afraid the same will happen to JT after result,btohqsg
BB sold a bit then trigger all the SL,btohqsg

Think tml better observe 1 more day before taking action...,btohqsg
Hope tomorrow market sentiment will be better.....since all the rest of the counters also dropped in sympathy with MT today.,btohqsg

Well just hope the BBs put their profits to good use for the society,btohqsg

Hope don‚Äôt do a double flush  but there‚Äôs also a possibility to wipe all hope,btohqsg
Market unstable   better monitor for new incoming wave before jumping in mt,btohqsg
