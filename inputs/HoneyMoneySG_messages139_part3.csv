Hi  if I missed the sc esaver promo  do you have recommendations for where to park around 50k? Would choc finance be an option (as they reduced their rates as of today),btohqsg
today still have marathon.. but 0.3% lower,btohqsg
hi guys  will citibank reduce my credit limit on my credit card when my EP gets cancelled?,btohqsg
im leaving singapore so want to carry on using it,btohqsg
ive always paid on time etc,btohqsg
chocolate finance decreased their rates to 3.6% for first 20k ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Hi ExpertRegarding dbs yuu amex card.Does paid telco bill like starhub consider under spending to hit300 sgd ?I did check the t&c and did not see it but I just want to confirm incase I miss it.,btohqsg
But the interest for choc finance  is still higher than the interest rates for sc e saver if for up to 50k right?,btohqsg
I dont think so unless you do credit limit review with them,btohqsg
will MOM notify them ive left the country?,btohqsg
No one here can advise you legally. Suggest you check with the bank on the proper procedures. They might let you keep the card  as long as you continue to pay the bills on time. But no guarantees.The moment you need to change address to non-local address  the banks will start questioning.,btohqsg
Deleting my comment as I think Melvin reply is more appropriate.,btohqsg
For standard chartered credit card bill I pay by bill scb and my card number they show need 2 day for the $$ to transfer there is it the same as every1? Cos I check is no update!,btohqsg
Din see leh  u mean for the card or saving acct lol,btohqsg
I think the normal bonus is in. I saw mine increased but not a lot cuz of spending more on dbs alt,btohqsg
i think highest is OCBC 360 for now,btohqsg
Shall wait for the update in app tomorrow,btohqsg
If you are leaving the country for goods  where do you expect the bank to send physical mail to? You donâ€™t want your bank letter n replacement card with PIN number send to stranger too  right?,btohqsg
From time to time they will send u physical letter if required. You are suppose to update bank your latest address  or else any loss you will be liable.,btohqsg
There will always be physical letters. And you can't stop the new tenant from doing anything malicious or reporting your non-residence to the bank.,btohqsg
Im registered at a friends house,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/244159Unless you are legally qualified to reply zk777  I suggest no further replies to his thread. PM him only if you are legally qualified to provide such advice.,btohqsg
I think its best to call them to find out the situation.  Im a good customer and want to use their services still so I dont get the issue  Just wondering if anyone else on here had a similar issue  thats all,btohqsg
The only advice that we can give is to read the t&cs  especially clause 18.4.,btohqsg
So mean is correct? Cos I 1st time use and cannot even try using $1.i use $5 to test,btohqsg
My dear friends  HSBC Everyday+ Cashback for GIRO IS IN!,btohqsg
Which date were yr giro deduction? Mine was 24 but havent gotten it yet.Maybe rolling by stages.,btohqsg
15 Oct  definitely by stages. The guy come back from MC liao. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

Tbf  they promised 10-17 Oct only hahaha,btohqsg
Yea. Still within the 14 biz time frame,btohqsg
Even for those after 17th Oct?,btohqsg
i think cut off is around 20 octi received 1% ega for 11 oct  until 17 oct transactions21 oct onwards not received,btohqsg
Mine is 18th Oct  also not received,btohqsg
Mine is for my giro made on 14 oct. 21 and 22 oct giro cashback no issued yet,btohqsg
Too much no need say haha. Too little faster ask  but provided it's between 10-17 Oct de.,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s not full. More should be coming maybe later tonight or tomorrow,btohqsg
Haha  we whine so much about EGA everyday+ cashback not coming in. But on arnd 8-10 Oct  Iâ€™m q sure many of us got some weird cashback indicated with Everyday+. although itâ€™s small amt but still donâ€™t know from where. But free money just accept lah,btohqsg
yes but not full yet  they already give cashback for transaction made in 11-14 oct but after that still no for me,btohqsg
For HSBC Everyday+ 1% Cashbackwat u guys use to pay. and how to do it.?i got few things to pay and not sure if they are eligible.1) car loan (tokyo century)2) HDB loan3) SP4) Credit card (DBS)5) prudential insurance premium.,btohqsg
"Credit card can search online with ""interbank GIRO"" + bank name.Prudential insurance premiums can setup eGIRO using iPay.",btohqsg
Sp can pay by card then giro the card to ega,btohqsg
For UOB one account salary credit. Can I use my own account to pay now the salary as my hr did not include the salary code.,btohqsg
Hi friends  can I confirm.I participated in EGA BONUS interest at October 2024 for premier segment.However if my balance fall below 200k or I downgraded back to normal banking before the fulfilment at 28 Feb 2025.Will I disqualified for the whole bonus interest or it will just reduce the rate to personal banking,btohqsg
Best u ask hsbc regarding this,btohqsg
Seriously I may not given that I don't lose like 1000 in interest between putting my money on HSBC or other lower interest banks.,btohqsg
I don't know how this marathon works but when I select the options online  I am only eligible for like 0.28% interest?,btohqsg
Will not downgrade so fastIf HSBC do that definitely alot of people affected  not just you,btohqsg
Do I open an account today  making sure that I have a MAB of 100k and leave it there till like 2nd Dec and withdraw to throw it back to my ocbc account? The way I interpret it is like I just need to ensure my balance on 30st Nov is 100k more than my balance on 31st October which is 0,btohqsg
Remember TnC say something abt fall below more than 12 month then drop. But below 200k deduct $50 per month. Probably just ask rm.,btohqsg
