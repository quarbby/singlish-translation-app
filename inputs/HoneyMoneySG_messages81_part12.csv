Sorry I meant that spending at UOB merchants will not be counted towards UOB evol cashback,btohqsg
actually spending at uob$ merchant does count to $600 min spend and get 0.3% cashback under others category,btohqsg
Hi all  about moomoo 5.8% promo. If I subscribed $40K in October 2023  when will I get the bonus Interest?I received a small amount  $70 last November. Is that it?,btohqsg
Took less than 2 working days for me. Did it last month.,btohqsg
No rush to do on 1st jan cos all top ups will only earn interest in feb. So might as well top up last day of jan,btohqsg
I missed out top-up srs tis year  passed cut off date...any alternative investment to invest srs money to have same return amt as tax relief ? For one year(short term) investment.,btohqsg
I would suggest tracking your spending daily to make sure you spend at least $600.1. Only posted transactions within statement month count to min spending  non posted transactions will count towards next month.2. UOB$ merchants will count towards min spending but will not be considered under online/mobile contactless if you receive UOB$. If you don't hit the minimum amount to get UOB$  you will clock online/mobile contactless. CONFIRMED by CSO.,btohqsg
No rush but MUST do it before cpf contributions. Once you miss it  you'll only end up having to RSTU more amount which will be reserved.,btohqsg
If I spend to hit the $500 spend today for the UOB one account  is it too late?,btohqsg
Yes cause it need be posted ~,btohqsg
Try again next month üòÖ I'm guessing you're using a UOB CC without min spending?,btohqsg
Well the best way is to track your transactions daily to prevent it from happening again,btohqsg
hi all  wanted to ask a question on CPF and the difference between SA vs MA top ups and  supercharging of OA/SA which i still do not really understand... if i top up my SA (RSTU)  what are the actual implications? what happens to the SA that is contributed by cash?I understand it as the SA amount topped up will go into my RA and cannot be shielded. but how does that work? once my SA hits 40k  i can put all of the amount above 40k into investments before 55 right? doesnt that shield the same way?,btohqsg
The topup amount tgt with the interest this amt earns until u r 55 will be marked as reserved. If the total reserved amt is less than 40k  then it dosnt matter  since u cant shield the first 40k in SA anyway. If the rserved amt is more than 40k  then u cant shield the reserved amt which is more than 40k.,btohqsg
Oh! on the statement it shows $628 spent but on the UOB one account spend meter only show $400+. Will I still be eligible for the bonus interest? üòÖ,btohqsg
I think can  go to cpf website Home>my cpf>Retirement and scroll down. I believe that amount is for both RSTU + VCMA (I did 8k VCMA) even though the retirement page is for SA. But ya  sad that they removed that feature from the singpass app,btohqsg
So just to confirm that i understand correctly. basically if my RSTU reserved amount goes >40k  (eg. i topped up 50k total). i cannot invest that 50k  but anything above that i can still invest for CPF shielding?,btohqsg
"Ahh thank you so much. I see it now!@ChrisHMSGcan take note too.To be clearer is Home -> mycpf -> My dashboard -> Retirement. After which  scroll all the way down to see ""Tax relief""",btohqsg
One account is based on calendar mth spending,btohqsg
HiAbit confuse when i open the page.Is this investment or Life Term Insurance?,btohqsg
no it wont. based on calendar spending. basically  you better spend $100 today to be eligible for ONE interest,btohqsg
Also  it took more than 1 working day for the numbers to update on that page for my case. So I guess don't expect it to reflect the updated amount immediately,btohqsg
Oh I‚Äôll still be eligible if I spend today? Probably won‚Äôt be posted yet tho,btohqsg
i click on the link provided. Its bring me to this page.https://www.snackbyincome.sg/products/invest?utm_source=user_invite&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=snack_invest&utm_content=invest_referral_msg&shortlink=9444579b&c=Investment%20Referral&pid=User_invite&source_caller=ui,btohqsg
My lady statement is changed to calendar month alr üò≤,btohqsg
based on my understanding... it is based on CALENDAR month  not POSTED/STATEMENT month. so even if you spend today (ie. calendar month DEC; posted month JAN)  it should be ok. but not an expert in this. take with grain of salt. just my understanding,btohqsg
Hi all  wondering Chris in YouTube video does mention invest interactive broker using RSP will have cost efficient and cost around 0.38usd per trade  wondering if self trade every month without fixed amount of investment  will still able to get cost invest around 0.38usd or how it should be calculated?,btohqsg
