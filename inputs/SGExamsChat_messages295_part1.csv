what led to the rise of hitler,btohqsg
yes anything else other than the govt? I'll say article 48,btohqsg
skilfulness at making deals with other politicians,btohqsg
i think thats pretty much it,btohqsg
there were a few events that happened,btohqsg
positive impact- unemployment reducednegative impact- no autarky- ppl lived in fear- minorities were discriminated and tortured,btohqsg
this is all i rmbr 😭,btohqsg
Me elect hist grad  does this count?,btohqsg
they were quite close to achieving it,btohqsg
the unemployment reduced issit bc of the union,btohqsg
I still rmb my school SBQ got the ernst rohm,btohqsg
so for the PEEL just say b4 vs after,btohqsg
Sry I only rmb Cold War hahaha 😝,btohqsg
so u say b4 it was like great depression,btohqsg
Sorry guys I'm spelling complicating  shit out,btohqsg
no worries I feel u I tried to rmb that for prelims,btohqsg
but then after hitler came into power  he provided jobs for Germans,btohqsg
and then after  ppl had jobs,btohqsg
he appealed to the rich upper class,btohqsg
another positive impact is actually rearmament maybe?,btohqsg
aft he got the support he eliminated the communists,btohqsg
because b4 that they didnt have much military strength,btohqsg
just KIV this one  because im thinking of this on the spot  my chers didnt actually teach me this,btohqsg
wait do we have to rmb stuff about the hitler youth and maiden stuff,btohqsg
he wanted women to stay home,btohqsg
