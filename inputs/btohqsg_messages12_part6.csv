meaning marital status as single and indicate NRIC of husband/wife at the bottom part ?,btohqsg
fiancee = not married =  not husband/wife,btohqsg
but yes need NRIC of male and female applicatant,btohqsg
If you are applying for the fianc√©e finance scheme  then there will be applicant 1 and 2. When you input  they will ask relationship of applicant 2 to 1. That is where you indicate fianc√©e/fianc√©,btohqsg
But marital status is still single. Because engaged isn‚Äôt a marital status.,btohqsg
