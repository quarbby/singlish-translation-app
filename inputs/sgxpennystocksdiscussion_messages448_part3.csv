Actually recently Hyphens Pharma came alive. I got in 305 lots $0.3125 average when shared here and out at $0.3525 at the recent run this round.Vicplas and Hyphens chart very similar I reckon. The break up out of the downtrend should come pretty soon based on my analysis and monitoring of the PA. Dotted lines are probable resistance where some can TP along the way.Hope I am right  risk reward is there.EP - $0.240-$0.250SL - $0.220 - $0.230TP - OTOT,btohqsg
Bro vicplas got to hold one right,btohqsg
Ya  vicplus see rested long enough,btohqsg
Depends  it’s almost there at the apex.If this week price still maintain and not much sellers 245  might attempt to trigger  see whether BBs come.,btohqsg
Yes Vicplas...holding at 0.25 for 2 wks already ...price range at 0.245 to 0.25 for very long ...Time to move like CFM,btohqsg
More than that liiao .. range bound so long,btohqsg
Dear Hustlepeople Happy Sunday to all.Just Some sharing on when you spot prior accumulation. This one is for Kim Heng Offshore which yesterday doubled to 100%. within 2 trading weeksThis conversation between me and another member was the weekend before the Monday where Kim Heng offshore Broke out. Kim Heng closed $0.038 that weekend. As you can see  we both spotted that prior accumulation and kind of knew it was coming due to the recent bullish sentiments. However  I wanted to collect more still but due to the matching action by someone  it probably startled the BBs and made them act sooner then later.I am sharing this to let all members know that it is really possible to spot BBs activity. Ultimately they will have to collect (prior accumulation) before they run the counter. If you spot right  u deserve the big win. Vamos! Let’s all work hard together to spot them 🙏🏻Join us to find out which counters might be next to make big move.https://t.me/sgxpennystockstradingplan,btohqsg
