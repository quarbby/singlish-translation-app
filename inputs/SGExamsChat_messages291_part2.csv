then why not go to poly after nitec ?,btohqsg
Gpa to go poly after nitec 3.5,btohqsg
I take NA math at Sec 3,btohqsg
And took A math at Sec 4.,btohqsg
It very rare for NT student to take A math,btohqsg
Bruh then u never promote to NA,btohqsg
Last time I NA I took combined science in O level syllabus,btohqsg
you got the opportunity to choose,btohqsg
Tbh i been self studying A math at sec 3,btohqsg
Then my E math teacher know that i been self studying A math,btohqsg
And he let the HOD know about it.,btohqsg
And HOD want to see my EOY for E math first.,btohqsg
That was how i take A math at NA,btohqsg
Causeâ€™ like time I died in AM so badly,btohqsg
my amath cher was pretty gd,btohqsg
I am the type can read solution,btohqsg
Anyone know that app where u can do like task for someone and get paid,btohqsg
Idk I seen in on tiktok,btohqsg
Oh I went the NA then O level route after the GCE NT exam,btohqsg
u plan to do that in future? Or was it like a course u chose randomly,btohqsg
I plan to be a math tutor ah bro,btohqsg
It works that way wtv u described,btohqsg
wah quite diff from what u study  lol,btohqsg
actually why didnâ€™t u continue the secondary path to O level?  Ur results q good what lol,btohqsg
where the heck u get fe2 HAHAHA,btohqsg
But then people said that Fe2 came aft the solution got oxidases which means it wasnâ€™t present bef in the sol right,btohqsg
Aaaa so frustrating. I wrote Fe2 as well but then everyone said itâ€™s wrong,btohqsg
My Cher was the one who did the experiment when we were doing,btohqsg
For English paper 1 compo rite  Is it advisable to write descriptive and narrative . ( ps   I am really trash at writing agrumentive ones  because I donâ€™t have global example to use ),btohqsg
I hardly read the news ;/,btohqsg
descriptive and narrative are good if you have a lot of content  but u need a lot of good descriptors and flow to the story,btohqsg
so ur lang need to be good,btohqsg
descriptive writing is easy to score in,btohqsg
argumentative dont have to use news per se  hypotheticals work as well (though ofc using news would be good)  also dont rly hae to use current affairs  i think relevant example are good enough,btohqsg
So   are you planning to write descriptive ones ?,btohqsg
Do you know the format for it ?,btohqsg
My school trains is argumentative  so I donâ€™t anything about descriptive,btohqsg
honestly none of them are easier than the other  best is to train n practice for all   in the case ur banking for descriptive essay but then they come up with some confusing ass thing to describe also difficult,btohqsg
uh i think the format is more flexible. for example  last year O level section C tested smth along the lines of  what youâ€™d do to de stress? i j wrote an intro and 3 different activities  then conclusion. actually a lot like argumentative except itâ€™s less dependent on hardcore longing :),btohqsg
it straight up said describe no?,btohqsg
i personally j go for the descriptive one regardless of if itâ€™s hybrid because i find it easiest to smoke HAHA,btohqsg
argumentative is a hit or miss,btohqsg
Last year the qnâ€˜ there is. I place like home ) DYA,btohqsg
Yea I am scared if Cambridge decides to give a hard qn on argumentative,btohqsg
So in this case I would write narrative for the first time ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
I am trying to be flexible,btohqsg
for narrative  your language doesnâ€™t have to be stellar. just try to pace yourself well  donâ€™t drag on the preamble or the conclusion.,btohqsg
more than the actual plot  make sure ur grammar is good,btohqsg
Does descriptive need really - atas descriptive words to write ?,btohqsg
