Scolding for spelling the teachers name wrongly hahaha,btohqsg
U know is all over when u are sitting beside 2 rows of RI students,btohqsg
i spelt a ntu lecturer name wrongly then he blasted me on email,btohqsg
i wrote an apology letter in a very formal tone,btohqsg
and worst thing is I wrote another letter with the same name but he ignored the correct one even though it's the first one,btohqsg
Dear Ms ——— I would like to sincerely apologise to you for my actions.  I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience caused due to my late submission. It is entirely my fault and I didn't mean to spell your name incorrectly.I will take necessary steps to ensure that this will never happen again. Thank you so much for sending in my application.  I am truly grateful and I really appreciate your time going through the data.Regards Mw,btohqsg
i had to go online to search how to type apology letter,btohqsg
wait i show you my one,btohqsg
but i manage to get the bursary tho hahaha,btohqsg
even tho i was late for 2 week,btohqsg
Sorry for the error made  I was sending two emails concurrently to you  Dr Kym Campbell and a representative of a demining organization. And I have sent the wrong email to you and was unable to undo the email when I had realised what had happened. So I sent a new email while deleting the old one thinking it would be able to remove the incorrect email such that only you would be able to see the correct one. I am once again really sorry for the error on my side and I hope that you would be able to forgive me and carry out the email interview.Have a great day ahead!,btohqsg
grammarly put a 5/5 for the formal tone i was so happy,btohqsg
MwFirst  it is very annoying when you can't even SPELL my name rightyou were all reminded to use your official  gclassroom email address by the HOD ITyou better be grateful that i had gone through all the data of  MOE FAS cases - very painful and time-consumingand had submitted your name to meet the deadline few weeks ago!!!in life there are many situations when once you missed the deadline  opportunities are lost,btohqsg
People that scolds you for spelling their name incorrectly is completely unreasonable. A lot of people spell my real name incorrectly and I don't scold them for it. Even if I don't like the 'new' spelling,btohqsg
she caps and bold it sia,btohqsg
but it was totally my fault,btohqsg
last time i have this teacher called Mrs Quek,btohqsg
but i spell it as Qwek,btohqsg
omg what did she say to you when you did that,btohqsg
den afterwards i ask my friend they say is Brian,btohqsg
den i typo and spell it as Brain,btohqsg
den i realise i called him Brain,btohqsg
you should be glad it's only 50 and not 100,btohqsg
but the name auto correct sia,btohqsg
Just tell the person off. And then  I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. Yours sincerely  xxxxxxx,btohqsg
