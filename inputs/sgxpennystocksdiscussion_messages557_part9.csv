"China coal prices plunge from record high as govt considers intervention1. China's coal futures fell 8% to their downward limit in night trading on Tuesday  steepest plunge since August  as the state planner said it was looking at ways to intervene and bring record high prices of the fuel back down to a ""reasonable range"".2. Chinese law allows the State Council  China's cabinet  and regional governments to limit profit rates and set price limits when prices for important goods or services rise sharply  the NDRC said  vowing to crack down on any irregularities and maintain market order.3. In a third statement  the NDRC said the Zhengzhou exchange should pay close attention to coal price fluctuations and said it would step up supervision of prices  while cracking down on speculation - something the Chinese authorities have repeatedly blamed for high commodity prices this year.",btohqsg
