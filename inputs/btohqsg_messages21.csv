Usually how long is the wait for the call to select? Let's say today ballot results released  my queue over the available unit (600 to 260),btohqsg
Hi  can I know when flat selection starts? Anyone knows the trend? cause it wrote start in Mar 2024,btohqsg
Hi. Can we apply for both SBF and BTO for Feb?,btohqsg
hi is getting a ballot queue means that it's confirmed?,btohqsg
can i check if let say i get queue no.1 for the woodlands BTO,btohqsg
Ur queue below flat supply yes  outside flat supply  50:50But if Choi break up  then confirm won‚Äôt get unit,btohqsg
2xx out of 720  good result?,btohqsg
Not sure why HDB mentioned will provide more information on our booking appointment. Our queue number is far behind the flats on offer,btohqsg
With the application rate not so hight for queenstown ulu pandan vista DEC'23 BTO  How come HDB mention that my balloted queue position has far exceeded the flat supply.                                                                I don‚Äôt know how HDB do the calculation.......ü§î,btohqsg
Cause they supply queue numbers up to 300% of the units available,btohqsg
If way above ya it's false hope but you can alrdy apply for the next...,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 5% quota for the entire project (correct me if wrong ),btohqsg
Mature n non mature have a bit different,btohqsg
If 133 above supplied flats  it‚Äôs better to apply for next already project right,btohqsg
My dec23 within queue but my may23 out of queue   i can ignore may23 selection ?,btohqsg
My queue is 771 for woodlands 4room (avail: 614). Do I have to cancel this application if I want to try Feb SBF?,btohqsg
No need to cancel in ur application they will specify u can apply for other projects,btohqsg
There's still a chance for u cause supply is 600+ but it's prolly the reject units,btohqsg
Meaning u still can have two applications?,btohqsg
Yes number out of supplyCan apply second bto SBF as backupSystem allowWhichever number called up first you don't go/ give upAll you application are cancelled automaticallyWith 2 second timer promotion üòÅ,btohqsg
When the feb opens am i allowed to apply for SBF & BTO?,btohqsg
If give up sbf house selection counted as penalty?,btohqsg
Waa.. sbf Danger sia. Very limited to choose,btohqsg
Bto and SBF are 2 different projectsThe area are their sub projectYou can have one application to one project under your name choose one only,btohqsg
Like u mention which one will be success we take it,btohqsg
You big family of 10 each can apply on it ownThan have 10 chance on 10 different projects,btohqsg
Depends on your statusFirst timer seconds timerBTO more slot limited area 99 years wait for 3-6 yearsLast 5% to second timer (maybe for both projects)SBF less slot more / limited area40- 99 years wait for 0-4 years,btohqsg
End of the day title first timer second timer very important,btohqsg
Want to ask  the married child scheme will boost chances of getting a flat right? Do I have to be married or can be fianc√©/fianc√©e when I apply?,btohqsg
Just for show only la   i have child and married already gets a number after 3 try,btohqsg
I don't see any advantage whatsoever,btohqsg
You applied for a project near your parents place?,btohqsg
My sister even get faster than me not married yet no childMy child already born still no number at that time 2022 when i applyingSo my conclusion is all just luck Only,btohqsg
Isn't the MCPS for those that stay within 4km of parents/married children?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how MCPS works?I applied for Dec 2023 BTO. My queue number is 1500+ for 627 units.Just wondering where is the priority happening? Cause both my partner and I are confused.,btohqsg
MCPS doesn‚Äôt give u priority. It just gives u an additional ballot chance if im not wrong. Depends on luck too.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been MCPS twice and i didn‚Äôt even get queue number for the first time. Now my queue number is 11XX for 614. üòÇ,btohqsg
Some ppl next project don't use whatever mcsp  and manage to get within Q number without mcsp,btohqsg
Try at your own risk la,btohqsg
To many factors affecting the chance of just getting a Q number1. People holding up to more than one Q number but give up when it's their turn keep waiting for best that never come2. Area to hot / cold (no one wants it),btohqsg
Maybe too many people apply using MCPS - until the allocated flats are gone üò•,btohqsg
Cannot apply sbf and bto if both release around same time???,btohqsg
From what I gathered is the only real priority is the unit allocated for MCPS. Which is 30% for first time applicants.,btohqsg
Now that my Dec 2023 queue number is out. I‚Äôm not sure whether to apply for Feb 2024 SBF.,btohqsg
HDB put them together don't think will release individually on different timing,btohqsg
Apply for backup projectIf this number called up you just waste $10Number didn't call up you didn't apply for backupWaste time,btohqsg
https://thesimplesum.com/the-married-child-priority-scheme-its-a-trap/I think the MCPS just increases your chance of getting a number  how good the number is  probably down to luck. At least according to this link  but it's written in 2020 so maybe mechanics changed,btohqsg
cuz it didn't stated in Dec 2023 bto application,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the clarification!!!,btohqsg
Have a group for Alexandra peak?,btohqsg
So if my queue number for May is out of supply like 1200/900 but my Dec is within supply. I got selected to choose unit for May and i dont select my Dec within supply will be revoked ?,btohqsg
New rules start for Oct 23 projectAnything earlier are saved from itBetter call HDB and askHDB answer better,btohqsg
If you plan to give up may 23 project,btohqsg
When go select for May and u pay options fee and signed that time  the hdb officer will tell u all others applications will be cancelled automatically,btohqsg
Or go select whatever once u signed and confirm. Your all other applications will be Auto cancelled,btohqsg
So if i dont select may23  im safe right ? I want to keep my dec23 queue,btohqsg
it shld have stated tho  now u can‚Äôt opt anymore,btohqsg
Anyone knows when‚Äôs the the exact date for Feb BTO launch?,btohqsg
Should be safe as the new rules kick in on October 2023,btohqsg
The chances of getting called to select is pretty non existence right  if my number is 600+/260,btohqsg
yes 600/260 can give up u know why? Now the project no one will give up easily because have q and give up drop to 2nd timer,btohqsg
So nowadays ppl have Q already never drop out one laYour number 600/260 try again on February. GoodLuck,btohqsg
Anyone got link for Jurong Arcadia tele group?,btohqsg
how about if I previously applied Oct'23 but out of supply  then I applied for Dec23 and get a que number  now Oct23 project call up for selection due to available units  at this case my Dec23 que will be cancel?,btohqsg
So the question is u want select the Oct 2023 ?I suggest u go hdb check on the appointment date and if u selected a flat means your dec application is auto cancel.If u don't select  ask the hdb officer directly if your Dec Q number still vaild or not,btohqsg
Hi may I know where we can get the flat booking materials?,btohqsg
HDB will only send it to you nearing your appointment date.,btohqsg
Does anyone have the link to ulu pandan vista Tele group? Thanks in advance üôÇ,btohqsg

After all it is a ballot scheme. It does give you a extra chance... Who Knows maybe ur 3rd try u ge ti's because of the scheme üòÇ,btohqsg
You want priority and best chances its the MGPS scheme hahaha tio single digit,btohqsg
It is  it's the 4km you have to input the address of parents then they will give a confirmation. There's only 2 scheme u apply solo Married child and the FPPS,btohqsg
To check  if I didn't get my BTO as 2nd timer  what are the chances for the next round if I applied either SBF or another BTO project? Will we have a better opportunity for the next pick or remain status quo?,btohqsg
No one can answer this question‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ballot for a reason.,btohqsg
Just keep trying and pray if the subsequent projects have the location you prefer. You never know since it is via computer balloting and your prayers may be answered. üôèüèº I‚Äôm a 2nd timer and got it after the 2nd attempt. PTL! üòá,btohqsg
Ur ballot always will be 1 chance only for 2nd timer... Unlike first timer u can snow ball ur chances,btohqsg
keep trying like me trying for 1 year finally got!,btohqsg
I keep trying....trying.... (9 times) & got queue for Queentown Oct'23 BTO (Slightly out of supply unit) & Queentown Dec'23 BTO unsuccessful  balloted queue far away.....from the flat supply. Will trying again for coming Feb'24 BTO.,btohqsg
Keep trying sure win. Try 5 years at last 2xx,btohqsg
Same try for 4x got number but out of supplyAt least got number for the first time ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Hi guys  for sbf application right  can I chose the project or I can only give preference for 4 room 5 room etc?,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  what are some reasons that homeowners would BTO for the second time?,btohqsg
Asking cos it seems quite tough for second timers to get a number and currently not sure how it‚Äôs like being a homeowner. Will there be certain changes to the apartment‚Äôs condition that would encourage a move to a brand new flat?,btohqsg
Or for some is it an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù?,btohqsg
Maybe bigger family size also with more kids,btohqsg
Choose the area and room type,btohqsg
to pay off fully no more financial obligations financial freedom‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Wow yea that‚Äôd be great!! All the best!! üçÄ,btohqsg

Hi guys  want to ask  for cpf housing grants  when do we receive it? Do we have to pay the flat price first and cpf will refund to us?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to BTO.Before your second appointment it will be credited in your OA.You pay the downpayment and can utilise the grant to pay for the unit price.,btohqsg
Uhm what if for Resale? Can I ask this here?,btohqsg
Hi  would like to find out for my cousin who is 56 this year and got a good queue number  Dec bto and a fully paid hdb flat. Is he eligible for deferred payment scheme? As told by hdb he could use his sales of existing hdb to pay for the bto. TIA!,btohqsg
Thanks Jordon  does my cousin qualifies for this deferred payment scheme for 4 bedroom. His existing is 5 bedrooms.,btohqsg

What priority scheme are you referring to? Most of them just give extra ballot chance  not necessarily will mean you definitely get to choose,btohqsg
I also think so. Cos clash‚Äôs w CNY mid feb. So most likely delay till end feb leThx for ur reply. Cos I keep checking hope I don‚Äôt miss out for the application dates haha üòÇ,btohqsg
You can also follow the HDB telegram channel  they will release news on new launches,btohqsg
Mine is staying near parents. Married child priority scheme MCPS& I am a first timer too,btohqsg
So I hope I can get to ballot in the VIP queue üôè,btohqsg
usually the news will announce and its same day or next day for feb bto applications,btohqsg
Wishing you all the best! But don't have your hopes too high  unless application rates are low (which could be  it seems to be going down for some of the previous launches),btohqsg
Yup  so it's for serious buyers only,btohqsg
since oct 23 and dec 23 launch theres new system whereby you can see the applicationreceived.youwan high chance to be selected not choosy and particular you can opt for the lowest application received.,btohqsg

He accidentally put 4rm but I wanted 5rm...,btohqsg
He's saying that we got very good number,btohqsg
the plane noise at arcadia might be a big problem,btohqsg
you are deemed as a 2nd timer. 2nd timer quota for launches is 5%. First  timers are allocated 95% of the launch,btohqsg
hahha ya maybe. but i stay near the area and the plane noises are rlly horrible... so yeah... hahah i suggest hanging out in the area for a whole day to survey how bad the noises can get,btohqsg
Thank you...In future can be sold easily ?,btohqsg
Hi all. Typically  how early do BTOs get completed? Like earlier than the Probable Completion Date?,btohqsg
Can see if there is any sms alert that you can sign up forhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/Index.jsp,btohqsg
Hi all  do 2nd timers have grants for bto flats? TIA,btohqsg
Please take note of the levy,btohqsg

This is for the ballot chances,btohqsg
Any group for Farrer Park Arena BTO ?,btohqsg
Is this website more or less accurate? Coz the estimated TOP date here and the date that HDB gave me is very different. Whats your experience for you guys who refer to this website for reference for your key collection Date?does the flat usually ready earlier than the date that HDB gives  or they are pretty accurate?,btohqsg
Usually in between ECD and EDPDECDis the latest date that the main contractor need to handover to HDB after completing the whole project. On paper  starting from 01/01/18 EDPDwill be the latest date HDB had to meet to issue all the units' key to the respective owners. Failing which they will have to compensate owners contractually,btohqsg
Do 2nd timer qualify for sbf?,btohqsg
Yes  SBF and BTO is same. Is just balance of BTO leftover.U 2nd timer can try for it,btohqsg
yes. my parents are 2nd timer applied for sbf may 2023. just that 2nd timer no longer entitled for grants :),btohqsg
For those who are not taking any loan for the bto. How much down payment do they need when signing agreement ? TIA,btohqsg
Where the flat supply is less than 20 units and it is unable to meet the demand from first-timer families  only first timer families will be shortlisted within 100% of the flat supply.,btohqsg
hi  any idea when is sbf febuary opening?,btohqsg
Kim keat ripple.On BTOHQ says target completion is 01 june 2024.But HDB say will be ready 1st quarter 2025,btohqsg
Considering the options  wonder if I could take a small hdb or bank loan 100k or less. Any advice? Tks.,btohqsg
They emailed you to inform you on the 2025 date?,btohqsg
Have you done your HFE? It will show you the amount of grant you‚Äôre eligible for,btohqsg
Its was inform to me when i sign come down to pick the flat. got this from SBF,btohqsg
My friend same proj as you,btohqsg
but hdb wont give if too low the amount,btohqsg
Thanks. Which bank at the moment got the best package in the market? Newbie on theseüôÇ,btohqsg
Not sure u can engage a loan broker they filter for u which is best.,btohqsg
Can try contacting those mortgage specialists  they may have better offers,btohqsg
Mortgage master or red brick etc. not advertising for them,btohqsg
I see. So usually HDB timing is quite accurate lah.,btohqsg
Any groupchat for kim keat ripple? Cant seem to find one,btohqsg
Should be? They can give good estimation cause they have the most data points to measure from and they track it very well as it‚Äôs their job.,btohqsg
i tried never give 25k only,btohqsg
they say in the hfe its too low,btohqsg

Anyone know where is the location of Kallang sbf ?,btohqsg
For heavily undersubscribed 1st timers btos  any news that the limit of 5% for 2nd timers be lifted or adjusted? If not  we‚Äôll see lots of balance of flats with 1st timers still hesitate to buy.,btohqsg
No news  also means they won‚Äôt adjust,btohqsg
Interesting to see a flood of SBF. As they still impose the limit for 2nd timers in these exercises.,btohqsg
Good for those who have more urgent housing needs then,btohqsg
From the look  2nd timers for plh btos are more genuine buyers as lots of restrictions. Younger 1st timers may prefer to bto with shorter mop and then upgrade.,btohqsg
But moving forward with the Plus and Prime flats might be difficult for them to do so,btohqsg
Hopefully hdb can balance the real buyers from flippers. The new ruling is encouraged but they need to analyse the figures to make a balance especially for genuine buyers.,btohqsg
Still waiting for Feb24 BTOs to be out & to applyNo news yet. Have to wait till CNY den ü•π,btohqsg

Anybody has idea abt Woodlands Urban Rise BTO?,btohqsg
Anyone knows at which stage do we have to decide whether we want to do a joint tenancy or tenancy in common? During HFE application  I think we put both parties as owners to get an estimated loan amount - but this does not confirm whether we want to proceed with a joint tenancy right?,btohqsg
Mine was during the appointment to sign the lease for the flat,btohqsg
So if during HFE application  we listed both as owners to get a rough estimated loan amount. How can we go about getting the assessment for one owner only? And do we need to prepare a HFE letter for a single owner ahead of the first appointment?,btohqsg
I'm not sure  we selected our flat before the HFE rules kicked in üòÖ,btohqsg
Cannot once HFE approved  it‚Äôs more or less final.  No reassessment,btohqsg
But u can try your luck to appeal  but base on your reason u give. I feel high chance will be rejected.,btohqsg
Why do you want assessment based on only one owner's income?,btohqsg

I saw the about delifrance hdb hub  the temporary tables & chairs are out. The Feb'24 BTO should be lauch anytime from now.,btohqsg
Delay what delay...Not uncommon for BTO exercises to start end of the month and overlap to first week of the following month even without CNY,btohqsg
What has the temporary tables and chairs to do with sales launch...?,btohqsg
You can just go & see delifrance hdb hub opposite (MayBank)about 2nd level  before lauch temporary tables & chairs will out. They will keep after launch over.,btohqsg
May be the table is for Q&A (BTO)......ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
Do they always put out extra tables and chairs when there is an upcoming launch?New showflat layout or models in the galleries?Or  are there staff assisting people who are less IT savvy with submitting an application?,btohqsg

Hello  can anyone help to advise where to click to print the HFE Letter? Is there supposed to be a downloadable PDF?,btohqsg
Why you need to print? HDB can access it when you go for flat selection,btohqsg
I was told need to print hardcopy for HDB to file,btohqsg
Control + P and save as PDF or print if using computer,btohqsg
That screen is considered the letter already? üò≥,btohqsg
It will save everything as what u see on the web,btohqsg
No need as they can access it themselves internally.,btohqsg
Hello   just to check   is it possible to have reassessment of income and loans after hfe is approved if me and my spouse income changes some months down the road ?,btohqsg
No cannot. But u can try appeal with HDB,btohqsg
cant have to cancel the existing hfe,btohqsg
case to case basis you can try to appeal,btohqsg
hello  can i check if we opt for Hdb loan how do we check if we qualify for full cpf payment or need to top up cash for the month repayment?,btohqsg
You have HFE which shows you your eligible grant and loan quantum.Unit price - Grants - downpayment - CPF OA - loan.If loan is insufficient  need to pay the shortfall via cash,btohqsg
So for the loan  they will show you how much you need to pay monthly. Use that to subtract from your monthly OA contributions,btohqsg
Anyone knows if residents of Alkaff Breeze have started key collection?,btohqsg
If I cannot make it to the HDB appointment and appoint a representative  what documents must i give him to submIt to HDB?,btohqsg
Selection appt  if your flat has 2 applicants  just need 1 applicant to go. If neither can go  need to appoint a representativeSigning of lease appt needs both applicants there iirc,btohqsg
The appointment after getting a queue number. I think to select the unit?Do I need to pass my photocopied IC to the representative?,btohqsg
Nope  upload the docs to MyDocs@HDB,btohqsg
Only need one applicant to select the unit. Only second appointment (signing of lease agreement) then need both parties,btohqsg

If my 50% cash sales proceeds that is compulsory for my next flat exceed the purchase price of the flat? Do I keep the balance? Or ‚Ä¶ ? Anyone can enlighten me?,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone happen to know when the group for Feb 2024 Punggol will be up? ü•π,btohqsg
Ya balance should go back to you via CPF/ cash proceeds,btohqsg
Sorry is it cash or cpf?,btohqsg
Any CPF OA used for housing + accrued interest will go back to your CPF OA first. Remainder will be cash to your bank account.,btohqsg
For anyone interested to know why there is a price difference between a BTO & SBF:‚ÄúNew HDB flats offered under the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises are priced using the same methodology  which takes into account the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity  as well as the specific attributes of the flats  such as storey height and design.However  the prices of SBF units may differ from that in the BTO exercise for several reasons. First  the SBF price may be slightly higher as the units are closer to completion. Second  the SBF prices may also be updated if there is a change in prevailing market conditions. For example  in cases where the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity have softened since the time of the BTO launch  the prices of balance flats may be lower than their original prices.‚Äùhttps://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/q-as/view/oral-answer-by-ministry-of-national-development-on-bto-flat-prices,btohqsg
If I submitted an application for 4room but want to change to 3room  can I just cancel and reapply? Anyone knows? Will anything happen to my hfe,btohqsg
Write into HDB and ask them to amend. Do not cancel on your own.,btohqsg
one question. When applying BTO  3gen and 5room is under same queue number?,btohqsg
hi guys. sorry to bother. do you guys know if the centralised chute is just out in the open or at least will be in a room/walled up?,btohqsg
Usually it‚Äôs exposed. Not covered up or walled up,btohqsg
Hi all neddd some adviceI'm now still staying in mine flat & paying mortgage to HDBIf I will to apply for SBF and succeed how is mine mortgage & after I sold mine existing flat & I plan to sell flat then pay SBFBut if the SBF keys can collect immediately how will I get the fund to pay new SBF or can delay Sbf payment until I sold mine existing flatPlease advice thx,btohqsg
U can ask some insurance agent friend,btohqsg
Just the timing of selling of existing flat,btohqsg
First u need to settle your downpayment first.,btohqsg
Ya if Csn get keys fast duno how the Payment,btohqsg
This i Ned to use mine own Cash,btohqsg
Just try first.If you can settle the downpayment  partWhen getting key collection  u need to to match the timing,btohqsg
The best person to advise is a property agent that sell your flat,btohqsg
See anyone here to share more information,btohqsg
This is general understanding  not just for sbf but for bto too,btohqsg
Guess down payment I need folk out cash then I can proceed to ask agent to sell existing house,btohqsg
You have 6 months to dispose the existing flat after key collection. But you still need to pay the downpayment first. Do consult property agents or mortgage companies on understanding your available options.,btohqsg
hi gurus  1st timer. just wondering about 2rm flexi. theres type 1 and 2 right? cant select during application. is it only offered when they invite you down for selection?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if HFE loan amount will be reassessed at the time of key collection if not under deferred income scheme. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if 2nd timers buying BTO/SBF will get any grants?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know when details of the june and nov bto n sbfs will be out?,btohqsg
This year is once only sbf,btohqsg
will we be able to apply for bto if the hfe is not ready?,btohqsg
This yr is only 1 SBF during feb& 3x BTOs during Feb  June & Oct24& the new HDB law ‚Äî (standard/prime/plus) kicks in from Oct24 onwardsSo feb & June got  2 more chances under the old law üôè,btohqsg
Hope all of us get what we want!,btohqsg
Hi  checking if anyone knows if I have a queue number that is way out of the available units for the previous BTO launch  am I able to apply for the current Feb BTO without incurring any 2nd timer penalty from the previous launch application?,btohqsg
As long as out of supply can apply SBF/BTO new launch,btohqsg
Yes that's is why Type 2 always snatch up faster than type 1,btohqsg
Please always read the news first before come here and ask Thanks,btohqsg
Then what will happen if let's say even though the number is out of supply but I still get invited to go for selection for the previous BTO and I reject becuase units are not favourable? Will I get penalised for this Feb BTO?,btohqsg
Based on my understanding: If more than 10 units left and you reject  then your first timer status will become 2nd timer for a yearIf less no impact.,btohqsg
I see.. So end of the day it still depends on how many unit is left for the initial BTO that you have applied for  thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Yeah. Maybe can give a call to HDB to verify my understanding! Better assurance for you,btohqsg
hello  how to know if you are under deferred income assessment ah? the HFE does not state anything,btohqsg
if my hfe got no income and states got no EHG  does that mean my income will be deferred,btohqsg
Probably? Idk haha never applied HFE üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I check is there a telegram group chat for Tampines Green Quartz?,btohqsg

Hi all I got a queue number for may SBF but it is out of flat supply.But we got invited to book the available flats on 1st march. ( currently 8/45).Wanna check if i apply feb bto2024  will it void my flat booking on 1st march?Or will i get an penalty?,btohqsg
You can only book for one flat as I know,btohqsg
Yes of course just one flat.My worries is by the time the leftover flat is less than 5 supply.I might just wanna try feb BTO.,btohqsg
They will forfeit the previous one,btohqsg
u can check how many flats is left on 28th feb.. if too low then just apply for feb BTO before the deadline close bah.. if there are still units left then risk it for 1st mar.. all the best,btohqsg
U won‚Äôt get void but you can try. I find it‚Äôs pointless to apply.   1st March is your SBF appt.  Feb launch result likely will only be release end of March or worse case in early april and by the time you won‚Äôt even know if u can get a Q number for Feb launch.You can forgo your SBF appt  but Feb result will not guarantee u a Q number unless the applicant rate is extremely low. Which is unlikely.   With that being said  you are back to square one again if you got no Q number in Feb launch plus u also given up your SBF appt.,btohqsg
As a guide  follow what Destan mentioned. On the last day see the rate to decide,btohqsg
I see. In that case  likely i would try apply febbto2024 since it wont void the sbf appointment. I know it wouldn‚Äôt guarantee the queue number.,btohqsg
Where do i see the rate ?,btohqsg
Most 4 rooms are above 1.0 for now  except rail garden.,btohqsg
Slowly think and decide. Good luck,btohqsg
1.0 means definitely get?Equals to 100%0.1 equals to 10percent if i understand correctly,btohqsg
Put it in simple term  1.0 means 1  couple to one unit.,btohqsg
The calculation how it‚Äôs done  I not very sure.,btohqsg
Like if hit 1.3 does it mean 1.3 couple. Ya something like that  so I‚Äôm not very sure  on this,btohqsg
Below 1.0 is like a guarantee u will get to select a unit.,btohqsg
Yeah no one couldnt understand the complex logic,btohqsg
Like Punggol 5room  second timer is 13.7.  My understanding is it‚Äôs an average of 13 couples consisting of second timer fighting for 1 unit.,btohqsg
Ya this seems like the logic.Median rate represent 0.5. The description is saying that look for lower than median.,btohqsg
Oh ya I just thought of your 1st March appt,btohqsg
Cos if u do and have selected. Then your Feb application if u really apply will be void.,btohqsg
Yes this one make sense. Of course if i get flat booking already. The bto will definitely forgo.,btohqsg
U are in a 5050 now haha,btohqsg
I will still be going if there is enough supply and within the budget.,btohqsg
Either SBF which is a guarantee in a way just unit nice or not VS Feb bto getting Q number or not,btohqsg
Right  i just dont want miss out the chance if i cant get any SBF. Its really slim. Thanks for understanding my question.ü´°,btohqsg
No worries. Your not the first I met with such issue.,btohqsg
There are some even more complicated than yours,btohqsg
Interesting  will look out and learn from this channel.  Cheers and good luck !,btohqsg
Based on my understand  not possible. They will treate it as forfeit and you will need to wait for a year under the new ruling,btohqsg
anyone feel feb24 bro not as enticing?,btohqsg
is rthere any telegram for Fernvale Vines,btohqsg
hihi  anyone kind enough to explain what the application rate means? Like the numbers for first timer fam and 2nd timer fam,btohqsg
Anybody know if after getting queue number and called down for selection  but didn‚Äôt select  what is the penalty for first timer ?,btohqsg
I thought you are able to reject the selection twice..?,btohqsg
I believed it‚Äôs once as a first timer  the next application as 2nd timer  and lucky enough to get queue number and called down  then will be banned for 1 year,btohqsg
May I know where can i get these official info from?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone having issues selecting 3 room option for feb 2024 punggol project?,btohqsg
Where u check this status info from?,btohqsg
I'm new to Bto. Last nite Tampines st 41   blk 414  5th floor got fire   thick and black smoke at abt 7:15pm. Fire engines arrived and quick access at right below the block open carpark space.Wonder how at bto high floors to have quick access especially the blocks surrounded by carpark roof top gardens.,btohqsg
Every building in SG has a fire escape plan I believe.. even the 70 storey swissotel Stamford.. scdf will have a way to reach u.. if u are stuck up there just take nearest stairs to run down,btohqsg
Not sure bto have quick access to water supply for fire extinguishing access at every floor level..,btohqsg
This is exactly true..at least a 1.5kg ABC extinguisher for mid to high floor. After seeing the real fire   at the spot where you heard people screaming  smell the thick harsh black smoke smell  glasses broken sounds   neighbour's voices  running and heavy feets stamping everywhere and black horror smoke coming out from windows   every seconds is so priceless..the feeling really sinking into the heart..Waiting fire engines is a norm   but what save lives is those early seconds before fire engines/ ambulance arrive or into action..,btohqsg
Can I ask  my friend asked me she just converted to Singapore citizenship  does she qualify to apply BTO? Or there's a term to wait few years of holding Sg citizenship only allowed to apply?,btohqsg
If her singpass already become Pick IC   or converted already gotten her ic then can,btohqsg
PR singpass is blueSC singpass is pinkThe digital ic,btohqsg
Talking about this. And it happen today,btohqsg
The unit is just on 3rd floor.. Imagine BTO now cramp and narrow space for fire engine to arrive   high floor waiting rescue will takes time..Better own household keep ABC 2kg tank and know how to use   especially high floor BTO,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say we got a fire extinguisher. How does it help if it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs house that got fire? U mean when escaping  can use to put out fire and clear the way? Haha,btohqsg
If own house   extinguish before too late for waiting the rescuers. If neighbourhood got fire   seeing no quick rescue can quickly offer life saving help.My concern is seeing BTO now and common older hdb   the access is different  especially high floor bto.,btohqsg
as someone who trained in SCDF b4  I can safely say a 2kg extinguisher would last less than a minute. So yeah a fire extinguisher is useless in most circumstances. A Emergency Escape hood would be more useful  although its efficacy is still debatable considering it last only for few minutes.,btohqsg
Hi anyone got grp chat link for the sin ming residences dec 2023 bto,btohqsg
Hi  anyone having issues applying for 3 room BTO despite HFE letter stating ‚Äúeligible for 3 room‚Äù? As in  the option to select 3 room flat doesnt appear on the drop down at all?,btohqsg
Yup  apparently can only call during office hours though. Shall try on monday. Meanwhile i‚Äôve already submitted an eform for issues.. just wondering if anyone is facing the same.,btohqsg
Yeah  tried on desktop Windows  and iphone interface on 3 different devices..,btohqsg
Tried selecting every project. The drop down still only shows 4rm/4rm and 5rm. No option for 2rm flexi either..,btohqsg
Right? üò≠ Maybe a glitch.. Hopefully they can resolve it by the deadline and still put in my application..,btohqsg
Definitely less than. And the HFE states eligible as well.,btohqsg
Fingers crossed ü§ûüèªü•≤ Thanks for the replies!,btohqsg
Hi  can anybody enlighten me y the 2nd timer median rate is NA for 5room Sengkang? No SBF flats set aside for 2nd timers?,btohqsg
Does ur hfe show u are eligible for any cpf grants for new flats? If u get grants it means u are below $7k ceiling. If u don't have grants it's means u are above $7k and it is not a glitch. The only 3 room that you can book is Tampines mature estate SBF 3 room..,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôve applied for four room this time  but after consideration we wish to apply for five room  can I just cancel my application and reapply and pay another $10? üò≠,btohqsg
Yes can cancel as much as you like,btohqsg
Wait for last day then decide,btohqsg
See the application rate to weight out the chances between 4 & 5 room,btohqsg
Yes good idea de! Thank you üòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Hi guy   can I ask my wife malaysian currently waiting for her PR to approve and she just renew her passport. Do I have to update to ICA for the new passport info ?,btohqsg

Anyways just for your info u need to update ICA .And fyi my wife is PR already last time is LTVP,btohqsg
Does anyone know how much it would cost to add each floor?,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask if after an application  I want to reassess income  how would it work? There are some changes. Will it even be allowed? If it is allowed and we get a lot  will it be going through the original HFE or the revised HFE?,btohqsg
Hm.. so weird.. but it‚Äôs also not possible that my income is >$7k..,btohqsg
It's household income. If ur occupiers are working their income will be counted together too,btohqsg
I‚Äôve only got my partner and i as co-owners and no other listed occupiers :‚Äù),btohqsg
Then it's the income ceiling issue and not glitch  that's is why cannot book 3 room,btohqsg
Hmmm  interesting. Thanks for the reply!!,btohqsg
not sure anymore man  got mixed replies when i saw someone ask about it. some people are saying that once the hfe is processed  there will be no reassessments even for the hdb loan aspect‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Depends on block and is there any unblocked views or even next time any plans of building any higher flats this will determine..It range from  few Ks to even $10-20K,btohqsg
Omg if 45 floor then is $450k,btohqsg
U can check the pricing on the launch ya,btohqsg
Is like example4rm flat up to level 20300K - $450KMeans level 2 is 300K level 20 is 450Kn,btohqsg
So u can estimate which level at which price,btohqsg
1kA blk on different floor the price will jump after witch it 1k each floorIf find different numbers means the unit could have come with OCS for SBF,btohqsg
Hello helloDo anyone know whether this time round   the Feb bto has any units with balcony ?,btohqsg
My BTO site i take level 8  level 9 difference is alot because of MCSP. And other blocks is difference,btohqsg
U can see my level 8  is $385K  level 9 is below is $396K is almost 9K difference. Why? Because level 8 is same height as the roof garden. Then level 9 is above so got 100% unblocked views,btohqsg
Usually the jump bigger for lower floorFor example  level 3 can + up to 20 kLevel 4 + $15 kLevel 5 + $10 kLevel 6 to level 10 $3 k per floorLevel 10-20 $2.5 k per flooorLevel 30 to 40 $1 k per floorSecond highest and highest floor same price,btohqsg
Just want to clarify  if I apply for this time round SBF. Would I still keep my number from last year nov BTO?,btohqsg
Yes. But if you select a unit in SBF or Nov BTO  any on hand ballot numbers will be forfeited,btohqsg
Yes but number with in supply system will block you from applying,btohqsg
My number is like 14xx  only 6xx units. But under MCPS.,btohqsg
High chance might not get the chance to pick. Just worried that HDB will force us to give up before we get the chance to even try.,btohqsg
Mine is 1110 out of 600 units for dec23. I asked HDB via my correspondence and they called me back. Basically told me I can apply for feb24 as my dec23 queue number was out of supply. They also told me I can appeal to waive off non selection count if I do get called to book flat for dec23 afterwards. So no worries and good luck!,btohqsg
Right  because it was outside the supply and more than 30% which is the usual rejection rate. Could appeal to waive off.,btohqsg
Is there really a need for HFE for flexi?,btohqsg
My parents will downsize from their 4rm to flexi which will easier be fully paid w/o any loan..,btohqsg
I think regardless whether ur taking a loan or not  u have to apply for HFE. Please correct me if I am wrong.,btohqsg
Regardless if taking loan or no loan hdb now requires u to do HFE and get approval letter before u can apply,btohqsg
If i apply feb 2024 BTO. and if march got OBF and i manage to secure a queue where i can select flat  how to go bout there on ah?,btohqsg
Hi yes I‚Äôm curious about this too. My HFE loan (expires in June 2024) is only $200k and I receive a queue number for a 4rm bto  appointment will be in April onwards. Understand that with the current HFE loan  I won‚Äôt be able to afford the 4 rm flat even after grants (still amounts to $300k++)? Wondering if i should reapply for HFE since there is a change in income for both my partner and I the past 3 months‚Ä¶ and if we don‚Äôt  does it mean that during our Bto appointment we will have to forgo the unit since we can‚Äôt technically afford it with the current loan?,btohqsg
Do let us know in this group if you manage to find the answer. My partner and I have been trying to get clarification for this as well..,btohqsg
i did receive this piece of info in early January. Not sure if it is a definite that there is no reassessment  as there is still that option to do so on the HDB website (a request for reassessment),btohqsg
Hi alls  I just got off a call with a HDB Relations Officer with regards to another income reassessment prior to key collection. (I‚Äôm also 1 student & 1 working but both will be working by 2026.)The officer said don‚Äôt have. The first assessment is the only assessment.I emphasised even with a significant increase in total income (from 2k+ to 9k  they will still say no).The officer also said HDB will not stop anyone from purchasing a flat even if its outside of your budget or if you have a low loan with your current HFE.Just need to be prepared to pay the shortfall in cash as one lumpsum during key collection.In the event you cannot save enough cash by key collection  they will refer you to their management and discuss the possible options to take from there.,btohqsg
Hello my aunty apply sbf but application scheme put her as first timer singleShe is over 70 applying mature estate 2 roomWill the application scheme course her to be NA?,btohqsg
all 4+ rooms application rate >1 for first-timer  seem like Feb24 more people applied compared to Dec23..,btohqsg
Punggol application also good even far from nearest MRT/LRT,btohqsg
What do you mean in your last paragraph?,btohqsg
I worry as single first timer my aunty can't apply mature estate 2 room as it states on the websiteFirst-Timer Singles is N.AManaged to call HDB their reply was senior over 55 years oldCan apply SBF in mature estate 2 room at short lease <99,btohqsg
Can leh I thought PM change stance already?,btohqsg
hdb just called me and told me if you have a loan amount as a student in your hfe bc you worked part time you will not be eligible for deferred income assessment,btohqsg
More of gov reduce the supply due to lower demand  so application rate will go up due to lesser units offered  like 175 units for Tanglin halt.Total only 4 k BTO flatsPast few launches easily 5-7 k units,btohqsg
Interesting to see u view it this way. I view it opposite of you.  I see it in a way is because gov stopping pple from anyhow bto. That‚Äôs why rates are low.,btohqsg
He is saying why rate for Feb 24 is higher than Dec 23So this is the explanationGov stopping people to BTO once has queue number already started from Oct 2023 already.3rd launch since Oct 2023Rate likely stabilised,btohqsg
this launch 5 714 in total..in term of total units not big different  but the spread quite big diff  last Dec23 a lot of projects <1,btohqsg
5714 units only 4K units for BTOThe rates refer to BTO only,btohqsg
perhaps BTO from 4 times > 3 times per year  n new plus model come in Jun?,btohqsg
Application rate is depends largely on number of units offerIf today hdb launch 10 units  it will 100% oversubLaunch 2 k units for one projectLess likely oversub,btohqsg
This Feb bto   any project has units with balcony?,btohqsg
If u free  go to each projects to click into the floorplan and see,btohqsg

Hello.I want to check/find out some stuff regarding the new HFE.I applied for a bto under Fianc√©/Fianc√©e scheme and have a HFE under both of our names.If I get a queue number and want to change to owner - essential occupier scheme during the process of choosing my unit  do I need to reapply for the HFE under 1 person's name before I go down for the flat selection?,btohqsg
Hello  just to check if married couple without kid  will get lesser Chance If apply for 5 room flat ?,btohqsg
Need to cancel and lose your flat/queue number  before you reapply for another HFE. Might be wrong though.,btohqsg
can you give a call to HDB or write in via MyFeedback? They may be able to change it internally.,btohqsg
Hi! Just want to check if I got a queue number for Oct 23 bto within 100% of the supply (large number) Can I still give up that queue number to apply for Feb sbf as first-timer?,btohqsg
Cannot  if you give up you will be downgraded to second timer for a year,btohqsg
Hello how do we contact hdb hub to expedite our hfe letter? Can it be done by going down to hdb hub to ask?,btohqsg
Just try calling them every single day  it‚Äôs usually quite fast,btohqsg
would going down personally to hdb hub be any use?,btohqsg
Tbh 3months of income won't change your loan much,btohqsg
Is the HDB portal down? Can‚Äôt seem to get in,btohqsg
Alright thanks bro will try again later,btohqsg
no  end of day the results are by ballot so its based on subscription rate/priority schemes if any(for that extra ballot),btohqsg
Why this time the Queenstown bto so many people apply,btohqsg
Usually how much % housing agents from era charge u when u sell HDB,btohqsg
Any one know one singaporean one pr buy bto need to pay 10k is when to have make this payment?,btohqsg
It is added onto your unit price so it affects your stamp duty as well,btohqsg
You mean is add to unit price -if 600k mean add 10k mean is $610k?it is ?,btohqsg
hello! can i check  for the staggered downpayment  is it 5% first then 5% when i get keys or has the percentage changed to 10% & 10%?,btohqsg
and for the HFE letter  i cant seem to apply for the HFE letter online (says im not eligible for HDB loan) cus my partner and i are both still students  so no income. do i contact hdb directly/submit feedback form?,btohqsg
Best you contact HDB to check on this,btohqsg
Hi  by when do i need to pay if I'm paying lump sum for the bto?,btohqsg
Just before key collection that appointment,btohqsg
Still have to wait le  now cant anyhow reject que,btohqsg
Hi what to select if both are full time students?,btohqsg
middle one should be No since both are still studying,btohqsg
so for full time students can only apply for deferred assessment during flat booking?,btohqsg
ya must bring student card and like some documents to show you are still in school according to what the officer told me,btohqsg
To improve the chances of success  applicants can look for flat application categories with application rates that are lower than the median.,btohqsg
If median is 10. If the rate is 8 will i get higher chance of success for that area?,btohqsg
Tq for the enlightenment. How about this? The median is 8.5. Will i get chance for que number if i apply at kallang. This is for the sbf unit,btohqsg
This means that you will have a higher than of getting this than if you applied for sth above the median (eg Tampines 4 or 5 rm). It's a comparison of your chances across all projects in this launch.You should still look at the number to understand your actual chances. 1st timer for kallang 3rm  is 3.2  so 3 applicants to 1 available flat,btohqsg
Yes. I used to understand if rate number is below 1 will get chance. But then this median info confuse me. Coz not many is below 1,btohqsg
The median would be useful to understand your chances for this projectcompared toother projects in the launch.,btohqsg
I heard that this year will have 3 launches only. Can I check if it is for this year launch only or future also 3 per year instead of 4?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if i cancel my application now  will i be able to re-apply?,btohqsg
Yes as long as before 2359 tonight.,btohqsg
Yes can. Hdb just earn another $10 application fee. Che Cheng $,btohqsg
So meaning the higher the median  the better it is or the lower the better?,btohqsg
Tbh lower is better (my opinion tho),btohqsg
actually no need think so complicated  just see 1 unit how many ppl bidding  example 3.0  simple means that your chance of getting is 33%,btohqsg
Lower. Number high means more people fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
Hi a question  if the units open is 499  applicant is 1200 and the rate is 2.0 for first timer  what are the chances to get it and how to calculate ? Median is 1.5,btohqsg
hi  MCPS where will you see it? is itwhen apply for bto there is a box to tick?,btohqsg
Can I ask the difference between first timer & third child scheme? Which is better,btohqsg
Both are separate schemes which can be applied concurrently if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
Morning guys. The final results of BTO is out. 4rm bedok area is 2.0x.So meaning 50% will be disappointed & another 50% will get to choose?,btohqsg
For hougang very crazy. 4.3x. Meaning more than 75% of the applicants will get nothingOnly 25% lucky one get to choose? üò±,btohqsg
Can only apply under one priority scheme only I rmbI apply under MCPS,btohqsg
In the middle of the form page. & they ask u to input ur parents address,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt final results out at 2pm?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt scare me leh. I apply BTO 3 years Liao. ü§£,btohqsg
Yup. But I saw the queue jump from 1366 to 1390 from 2359 to this morning for the project I choose. So relatively safe le ba. Within 2.0x ü•πLucky I got priority,btohqsg
All non mature üåùü§£ woodlands this time,btohqsg
I c. Actually for both non mature & mature  all first timers up to 95% üòä,btohqsg
The dec plot of land better haha,btohqsg

But out of supply by almost double ü§°,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why applied again this time üò¶,btohqsg
I c. So in the end u didn‚Äôt get to choose anything wrong üò¢,btohqsg
All the best to all of us. Good luck! üçÄ,btohqsg
selection for dec starts in March  I think nobody has any news yet. I have no hopes. üòÇ,btohqsg
always assume hdb waits till the last day then start. it‚Äôs quite normal,btohqsg
current 1 was dated 5pm yesterday,btohqsg
HDB/media cant wait to report the news..lol,btohqsg
Hougang one was crazy. Didn‚Äôt expected itLet‚Äôs wait 2pm & check 1 last time den üôè,btohqsg
I don't believe in priority.What's yours is yours. Just pray.I have a child and my sister do not  my sister still get within supply and im out of supplyNext BTO launch then i manage to get a Q within supply. That's 12 person fighting for 1 unit.Anyways depends on luck,btohqsg
And just for info im married with child and my sister is not eben married and applying with her bf,btohqsg
becoz very limited units but quite numbers of people interested,btohqsg
Hope u get the Feb24 BTO den,btohqsg
Yup even more crazy then the Queenstown one haha,btohqsg
QT under PLH  if not sure champion..haha,btohqsg
Yup 10 yrs MOP that‚Äôs yüòèIf not sure üî•,btohqsg
Which project u apply this time?,btohqsg
Thx bro. My first time applying for Feb24 BTOUnder MCPS & first timer üôè,btohqsg
Sorry i already have gone for 2nd appointment and waiting for keys now .Anyways hope u guys got your desired outcome results,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt see it. Single first timer is mcps applicable? I read somewhere on hdb site says it is but on another hdb page say only got ehg. edit: just called hdb. stay near parents not applicable for singles. thats a little disappointing. thanks.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if it‚Äôs possible to have a meeting with a hfe officer or something?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so. If can  everyone will do so.,btohqsg
Yup mcps = married child priority scheme so not applicable for singles,btohqsg
Hi all  I just spoke with an HDB officer. It seems that when the HFE expires and I resubmit the HFE (assuming I have a significant increment in salary)  the loan amount will still not increase; it will remain the same. However  if I have a poorer financial situation  it will decrease. Can anyone confirm? All along  I thought that when I resubmit my HFE before key collection  the amount would increase given my increased financial income.,btohqsg
This is really weird because by right it seems like the loan amount should be set in stone  which means regardless of increase or decrease it shouldn‚Äôt be affected. In any case I think we can just KIV as the HFE system is so new and policies may be refined after. Best to appeal on a case by case basis if needed  or seek MP for help if necessary.,btohqsg
I think the final application rate result will out at 2pm,btohqsg
At the 45 min mark  The HDB officer mentioned that they will review the income but it is to ensure that thebuyers have the financial means to finance the flat purchase and it is NOT for the purpose of giving a higher housing loan.,btohqsg
Lets say if got que number when will our income be assesed? Will it be reasses before key collection again?,btohqsg
Seems like no unless there is a drop in income. They will likely ask you for latest 3-12 months of payslips just before key collection to determine this.,btohqsg
If let say 1year before key collection we stop working and have no income..will they forfeit our booking?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so as long as you can pay up the full sum. Meaning if cannot get sufficient loan from HDB  probably need to approach bank. However is CPF OA or cash sufficient to cover all  then should be fine as well,btohqsg
Do check with them  try to email them to get it in writing,btohqsg
I hope they finalise the hdb loan and all during booking time based on our current income. Bcause along the way when the bto complted anything unforseen event can happen,btohqsg
I think my cpf is sufficent to cover the downpayment and monthly loan repayment,btohqsg
Do check w them when you go for flat selection.,btohqsg
I saw le just now. Online. Sad sad. Final updated results. 4rm BTO bedok from 2.0x up to 2.2xMeaning 1 unit. 2.2 ppl fighting for ü•≤,btohqsg
goodluck man  i also applied same project,btohqsg
Very good already as compared to last time when the rules haven't change,btohqsg
If u compared to last time rate is already now very good Liao. So just pray. This rate is from my time 2022 back,btohqsg
before key collection what type of documents do HDB typically ask for loan reassessment?,btohqsg
Good luck to the both of us. May the force be w u üëä,btohqsg
Wa didn‚Äôt know last time So crazy de üò±9.4x  close to 10x overly subscribed lei faint.Lucky mine is 2.2x now. God bless üôè,btohqsg
Pretty sure u will get a que number..2.2 is not too high,btohqsg
Hopefully get good ballot number. üôèI mean queue number is queue numberWhether get to choose anot and which floor lvl and stack facing is another qns üòÇ,btohqsg
I think they give out extra numbers incase others dropout,btohqsg
Yup they mention le. They will give queue numbers of up to 300% subscribe per projectSo is up to 3.0x ba,btohqsg
Haha. I wish u the best and goodluck. üôè,btohqsg
I pray ü§≤ hard leBoth SG & MY temples as well üòÇLet Fate & heaven do the rest üòå,btohqsg
last time can overlap application  meaning u apply for May BTO  then Aug one came out still can apply before u go for your May appointment,btohqsg
So many will try to apply both because the 1st launch if your number is at the back   u will likely to apply another one next,btohqsg
If i didnt get the feb bto  june bto can still apply again?,btohqsg
And next launch u gotten a better Q  then u can give up your 1st one.This is quite unfair system because those need a house is spoilt by all this ppl that plays the system this way ya,btohqsg
Like didnt get queue number ?,btohqsg
Means your Q is not within the supply then u can apply for June launch,btohqsg
Anyways just pray and also rememberAlways hope everyone can get their Q. Don't always hope dropout  don't always hope ppl will break up   divorce so u stands a chance.Just pray everyone is good and one day you will have a good karma and a good Q number. Your luck will come some day,btohqsg
Ya loLast time 8 k applicants fight for one projectNow 8 k applicants fight for 7 projects haha,btohqsg
7916 applicants for 1298 unitsMeans 6 k + people no chance to pick,btohqsg
Wa last time the rate was really crazy manNo wonder Govt change new law and the way to apply for BTOI guess it‚Äôs a good sign for all of us now üëç,btohqsg
After ballot successful  will we start receiving information of the BTO flat layout/site plan/flat availability once booking of flat starts? Cause our queue number is last 3 to choose a unit. Or we will only receive 1-2 weeks before our turn to book?,btohqsg
Thank you. I manage to find the pdf brochure,btohqsg
Meaning to say  as long as my queue number is out of supply  I can apply again for upcoming bto?,btohqsg
For SBF that is ready for key collection  if the queue number is called  is it an immediate down payment for the unit and key collection ?Meaning that the couple must provide a marriage certificate?Or is there a window period ?,btohqsg
You need to solemnise your marriage within 3 months from the completion of the flat purchase. HDB may request for a copy of your marriage certificate (where required) for verification.,btohqsg
@IgnChanJRfor more info do call HDB at 1800 866 3066,btohqsg
Hi hiMy HLE expired in July 24  so can I still take part in jun24 BTO?,btohqsg
Now is HFE you need it for all projects,btohqsg
Hiiianyone knows if married child priority scheme will apply for me and my partner if we are not married/engaged yet (but will be before keys collection) and the project we applying for is within 4km from our parents' place?,btohqsg
If u apply to live near parent should be eligible. But i suggest u apply first on next launch. Then the system will auto check if ur eligible or not.,btohqsg
Just want to ask u guys opinion..is it better to apply for sbf 2 room or apply for a 4room bto unit with 3 years waiting time?,btohqsg
Imo if money not issue  4 room. 2 room restrictions are too much. At least with 4 room can rent out. 2 room have to rent out whole unit.,btohqsg
I applied for Chai Chee Green.. this is my second time applying for house.. but I got this Chai Chee Green  i did applied for another 2 sales launch but nv get..,btohqsg

So I applied a few times.. then eventually get the Chai Chee green,btohqsg
I see. Great to hear u eventually get ur 2nd hdb flat..,btohqsg
Anyone here who has collected keys alrdy. And able to advise how much earlier on average does key collection take place from original PCD? is it like a few months before?,btohqsg

Is there a Hougang Feb 2024 group,btohqsg
Can kick and block those non related BTO contents user? üò≥,btohqsg
Hi everyone - just want to check if anyone tried to change the applicant(s) and occupier(s) after getting a unit (after 1st appointment)? Perhaps anything similar ?,btohqsg
My sis bookd her flat and incl my mum afterwards pre-lease signing (2nd appt). They're on the HLE scheme  where grants are evaluated post-booking. Unsure about appealing with the HFE scheme due to its upfront review of grants  loans  and income ceiling  excl those on deferment schemes.,btohqsg
Hi would like to seek advice that if we apply for feb2024 bto and would like to cancel the application  where and how to cancel?,btohqsg
You may submit online. Cancelling application may affect yr eligibility or priority for future application.https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain,btohqsg
HiAnyone know if there is any group for resales of HDB group?,btohqsg
I heard hdb wont reassesed ur income when key collection. They will finalise in regards to ur hdb loan  during the signing of lease agreement,btohqsg
Its the same thing. Now they call it hfe. Before it was called hle.,btohqsg
Hi all  my application does not have loan for the feb 2024 bto. Can I add in the loan later?,btohqsg
I beg to differ... I just experienced reassessment of income before first down payment from HDB,btohqsg
"Took about 5 months back and forth for them to ""reassess"" your income zzz",btohqsg
So really depends on your luck I supposed,btohqsg
hfe (hdb say) will not reassess  hle will reassessyours is under hle?,btohqsg
Hle and Hfe may look similar but diff.  Hfe considers income among other factors to give a more holistic view.  Applicant are required to cxl Hfe if wanted higher loan thus may affect yr qualification for purchasing certain HDB flats along with the related benefits and subsidies.,btohqsg
Yes. Hfe is abit different compare to hle. Hle is the old version. Hfe is the new one. Hdb just change its name from hle to hfe. Its the same thing in term of analysing ur financial capabilities  grant and etc,btohqsg
Yes can differ. No problem. Open to discussion anyway..i think what u mean is before the key collection stage,btohqsg
Recent Feb 24 webinar by Cpf and Hdb.https://youtu.be/gkEixjxvn3I?si=1nUgHmzj6eAW2SiIlisten to 40:00 onwards for those on HFE,btohqsg
During our booking appt on 1st Mar it was clarified by the HDB OIC: HDB financing eligibility (HFE) terms are fixed to ensure prudence. For higher loan amounts  applicants can consider bank loans.,btohqsg
I see. U applied for the dec 2023 launch?,btohqsg
Wah quite long ah the waiting time for booking of flat. I thought 1 month after result release,btohqsg
So u mean whatver hdb had stated in the hfe letter thats all we get? Cannot appeal or request for reassed again?,btohqsg
Hv to cxl current HFE if want reassessment,btohqsg
Since ours was within supply we recd q result in Dec and appt date was only given 2wks prior booking.,btohqsg
At the 45 min mark  The HDB officer mentioned that they will review the income but it is to ensure that thebuyers have the financial means to finance the flat purchase and it is NOT for the purpose of giving a higher housing loan.,btohqsg
eligible for those on deferment scheme,btohqsg
I see. So no point going for appeal to get higher loan. Because they are all fixed during the initial stage,btohqsg
May need to seek bank loan as alternative if want to get higher amount,btohqsg
Like u point out just now,btohqsg
Hi guys  how can I cancel my bto applications ? I have two - one I have queue number for but not yet selected flat (December 2023) and one from February 2024 (awaiting queue number). üòÉ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need cancel. Once you select  remaining ones will be forfeited,btohqsg
I‚Äôm cancelling both as im breaking up with my bf.,btohqsg
yes  just a little bit  definitely not to cover the whole floor again,btohqsg
You can always purchase tiles direct from the supplier   get the contact from bsc.,btohqsg
New tiles might have alight difference in terms of color tones so go for it if you don't mind,btohqsg
Hi guys let say that if I would to change company of employment do I n√©ed to inform hdb?,btohqsg
u need to inform HDB shld there be any changes in ur income,btohqsg
i think increase also need lei  cuz will affect ur loan + grants,btohqsg
Now grant and loan all upfront and won‚Äôt change liao cause of HFE,btohqsg
i think my case just suay  got increment  then just nice my HFE expire  apply new one got new loan + grant decreased,btohqsg
Hmm depends on the person. But from my understanding if you have a valid HFE with a ballot  you cannot amend the income already. If wanna amend HDB will ask you to withdraw and re-apply which will auto ban your first timer status for 1 year,btohqsg
I think the hfe is good. Its helps people who lost job or income before the flat is completed. For eg. 1 year before flat completion lost job. So its good they finalise the hfe and income early,btohqsg
Some people also want to take career break while waiting for bto. So its good for them as well..i heard one couple went to live in bali while waiting for their bto,btohqsg
How long on average does it for BTO ballot results to be released?,btohqsg
feb one will announce on apr,btohqsg

@King_Hezjoin the group  SM is tracking appointment dates in group,btohqsg
So far just started selection  you can see the estimates above^ on what date each queue number will be called if people have shared / if HDB has given an estimate,btohqsg
You can call HDB t check using your queue number. I called and they told me a rough gauge when my selection will be :),btohqsg
Sorry  how do I read this?Is it(Date) - (queue number)  time?,btohqsg
x is just a placeholder for the last digit,btohqsg
Ah I see. Okies thanks so much !,btohqsg
Does HDB let multiple ppl select within the same day?,btohqsg
Based on experience  could be a few to maybe 10,btohqsg
But each applicant has an appointment window  if the previous person hasn't chosen  the next person cannot choose,btohqsg
I see. How long is the window?,btohqsg
The window is for choosing  and also for all the documents,btohqsg
Selection days are on weekdays only? Or weekends too?,btohqsg
So if you already pre-decided your unit to select  it likely won't take more than 30-45 min,btohqsg
