my sch for girls only HAHAHA,btohqsg
Anyway pure sci is all wrong,btohqsg
U learn in chem today is all wrong,btohqsg
bio combined or pure nt much diff i think,btohqsg
ok if right u sure u want fo jc art stream take combi sci better,btohqsg
I have been self studying phys since last year because my phys cher is bad at explaining,btohqsg
I saw the tys i was like whr is chem standard,btohqsg
but physics pure and combined got more diff,btohqsg
combined science mcq is 2 tgt right,btohqsg
Just that their real world context not so jialat,btohqsg
q alot actually but they still learn the shitass hard parts like waves,btohqsg
u learn 75% of the pure sci content,btohqsg
is it gd to have more subjs or like,btohqsg
Wave is more or less straightforward,btohqsg
i do that and still failed wa1,btohqsg
ok but honestly  waves is basically a test on vectors,btohqsg
oh right i forgot not everyone exempted like me,btohqsg
i have 8 but i dont use the last at all,btohqsg
It's cuz O/A-levels don't see waves and their vector components,btohqsg
im alr kinda struggling as a socalled 7 subject student,btohqsg
But basically each wave you can associate a vector,btohqsg
My school doesn't offer trip sciences lit then some people take trip science + geo lit then they don't give a shit about geo,btohqsg
So they are in a way trip science lit,btohqsg
Our hillgrove sec 4 only got 1 class with pure chem and phys,btohqsg
i alr decided on which 6 subjs to use for l1r5,btohqsg
Lmao why even intro the lingo 'equation of state' not even used in A/Os,btohqsg
i need geog fr poly too,btohqsg
Double science double humans class leh. Innit 2?,btohqsg
I got double sci double humans,btohqsg
Shld be the other way round,btohqsg
@imindomieyour mom call me she ask me to tell you to study,btohqsg
Take bio only to learn physics in uni,btohqsg
ya ikr got ppl tell me poly dn humanities so i got a shock,btohqsg
Can become doctor find cure of corona liao,btohqsg
My junior you going pure sci ?,btohqsg
U dont need take bio for that,btohqsg
Bio isn't a requirement for med,btohqsg
I wanted to go find a thing u said about taking bio,btohqsg
Lots of $ on this btw,btohqsg
I think the latest news is that they don't want the vaccine to cause ADE,btohqsg
Not kidding u dont need bio bg to go research or med,btohqsg
U havnt seen membrane potential physics,btohqsg
My junior pls don't give up,btohqsg
how to get political science liao,btohqsg
When the velocity time graph got simultaneous eqn HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Why subject urself to torment over the S/U system,btohqsg
imagine not bringing calc for sci cam,btohqsg
Came out in my eoy before,btohqsg
oh ive been there but for math exam,btohqsg
Just work hard and it will be fine,btohqsg
