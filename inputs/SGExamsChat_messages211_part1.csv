Hello O/A Level students! Congratulations on completing your examinations (soon  for A level students :â€™â€™)Right now  you might be wondering what to do with all of the notes you have sitting at home. Before you toss them out  why not donate them to students in need?Jointly organised by REACH Academy and the Peopleâ€™s Association  Project renewABLE aims to collect used notes  scientific and graphic calculatorsÂ  from recently graduated students and donate them to financially needy students.Your notes will also be converted into a digital format and stored in SGExams' online repository for future batches to use! For students moving into Upper Secondary and JC  this could be a great opportunity to acquire valuable tools to aid you in your journey!All unused notes will be recycled  so as to reduce paper wastage. Donation of online notes is also welcome!,btohqsg
Give your notes a new lease of life  and pay it forward! Project renewABLE will be held on the 28th of November  from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Bishan Town Council Multipurpose Hall.For more information about who we are and what we do  visit our website (via our IG@reachacad3my) or drop us a text in the chat! We'd be happy to answer your queries.We hope to see you there :D,btohqsg
Preferably science books others also can,btohqsg
can explain how pocong come about,btohqsg
Pocong is the entity when a soul from a dead person is not freed from the body after 40 days  so it would find any human to release it. This is done by untying the strings from the shroud (kain kafan). I think it's a legend bc the way muslims are buried is that there is a board that securely shields the body from the soil in the grave.,btohqsg
so yall are supposed to untie the strings?,btohqsg
if i remember correctly they go around jumping at ppl and asking them to untie their strings right,btohqsg
or am i wrong lmao oop,btohqsg
sadly the MOE ppl i encountered think otherwise,btohqsg
they seem to give the vibes that better cop = better school,btohqsg
