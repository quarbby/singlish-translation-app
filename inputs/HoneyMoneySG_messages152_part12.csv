Hello guys which card is better citi premier miles card or Ocbc 90N card ?,btohqsg
Hi all  I want to try to use Citi pay all for the first time for my income tax. The tax amount is several times higher than my credit limit (I chose the limit myself). I am a bit confused because it seems like I canâ€™t pay the whole sum. Is it possible to pay this income tax with multiple transactions? Or should I temporarily increase my credit limit? Or whatâ€™s the best way to do it?,btohqsg
Hello guys  I believed this question has been asked before  but just wanna check again.To fulfil the UOB one account $500 spending  does insurance policy payment count?,btohqsg
If it's for income Tax you can schedule a few monthly transactions but each month is limited by your credit limit. If you want to take advantage of the payall promotions   you need to do it within the promotion months. Suggest it's easier to get your limit raised to an amount which better fits your tax bill,btohqsg

Helloâ€¦ itâ€™s for day to day spending grocery shopping etc..for overseas spendings itâ€™s not advisable ?Which has the higher chance to waive annual fee ?,btohqsg
Tbh either one is ok but neither is optimal for your use case. Citi seems to be more lenient with annual fee waiver.,btohqsg
Bill payment wise stack with Citi will be good too rite ?,btohqsg
Depends on what bills. Most bill payment won't get rewards.,btohqsg

Any suggestions on where I can earn some interest from 19k once my fixed deposit with dbs ends this month? For context  this is to pay for university. However  i am also working  so i'm trying to not tap into this money yet unless i don't have enough. So i guess i'll need some form of liquidity? Already using maribank for my other savings therefore i want to put this somewhere else with higher interest,btohqsg
You are working so ocbc 360?,btohqsg
A little short from 1.8k and im currently using dbs multiplier,btohqsg
