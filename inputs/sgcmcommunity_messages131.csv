Like I say   I will just clamp those car   let the enforcement come and settle,btohqsg
i ownself scrap their car for free,btohqsg
Mr Peg probably gonna tow your car away even if you're visiting a friend and parking there,btohqsg
Maybe everyone who wants to scrap car,btohqsg
Just go park outside Mr Peg house,btohqsg
would like to add  some estates have clear demarcated solid lines which doesnt allow ppl to park,btohqsg
Wei   I just provide my comment leh,btohqsg
I think up to individual to do,btohqsg
who he gonna find? i alr tow away his car to scrap yard good luck finding his car,btohqsg
yes its just a fyi…. relax mr arnav,btohqsg
Fyi if someone parked legally n u tow his car,btohqsg
You always par your car in those private estate is it ?,btohqsg
by the time he realise half his car in thailand scrap yard,btohqsg
But I have my own parking for regular use in my complex if you're referring to that,btohqsg
For me I just follow law ….,btohqsg
Cut 2 half take to JB alr,btohqsg
yeah sometimes they park side by side ah.. sibei zorteng,btohqsg
squeezing thru is a pain in the 4ss,btohqsg
You're not exactly following it by clamping a car that's appropriately parked for a short term sir,btohqsg
Later some itchy people will scratch the car   more heart pain if that happens   who to complain to sia,btohqsg
Best solution  all park inside house,btohqsg
How do you define by short term ?,btohqsg
I'd say anytime during the day hours is reasonable,btohqsg
Since night time is when most estates fill up completely,btohqsg
And parking further away to your house can be annoying at that point,btohqsg
I dunnoe   if I am the owner of the property I just clamp and call la or whoever lor .,btohqsg
u tell him call lta la 😂😂😂,btohqsg
u just make sure u legally park can liao,btohqsg
owner of my country sia  our singapore ❤️❤️,btohqsg

Bruh if u wheelclamp a car on a public property,btohqsg
Esp if its not obstructing any shit,btohqsg
If not get the owner to buy the excess of the road . Just like some hdb owners   they buy the excess of the corridors,btohqsg
The reasonings are very grey …. Therefore some one got to come out to speak out for this . If not no ending .,btohqsg
Im just curious what would LTA response be? Esp since now we have stories of ppl coming out say their car is vandalised,btohqsg
Maybe they just put more cctv in the area .or this sensitive period   they will not be doing anything ( presidential election coming ),btohqsg
Big hoohah over the prev one,btohqsg

i30 solid for you I think,btohqsg
golf you really need to see well and choose a good unit,btohqsg
but i30 also means i wont have spare cash lying around cus i30 all came out around 2018,btohqsg
if golf at least i can keep abit for major maintenance aka mu piang,btohqsg
i like hatchback now sia idk why,btohqsg
last time i used to hate it,btohqsg
but i guess small means easier to manovre in smol carparks,btohqsg
the ppl who buy i30 really earn,btohqsg
they buy the car for 90k,btohqsg
now the car selling for 70k ish ish,btohqsg

Hi I am new to SGcarmart  if I want to buy a car thru SG Carmart  Ican I still negotiate the price of the car with the dealer or is the stated price on the website the fixed price?,btohqsg
I see okok thank you  so if the car I'm looking at is about 110k  what could be a good starting price?,btohqsg
Must see what car and the condition lor,btohqsg
hmm okok cos it's a 2020 car  but yea I agree that need to see the condition in real life also,btohqsg
i30 also newer and is not yet m0lested on the market so you can find clean units,btohqsg
finding a clean well maintained one very hard,btohqsg
look at the condition  send in for a Pre Purchase Inspection at a specialist workshop or a workshop you trust and then basis the report negotiate,btohqsg
cause cheap when they buy then market shoot up and kdm did well cause they didn't start looking dated unlike the jap alternatives and some contis *ahem* merc c class and others *ahem*,btohqsg
wa dun lowball the dealer until like that lah,btohqsg
use COE then divide + ARF + Body value see how much  then u see dealer profit margin how much  then u see from there,btohqsg
always ask if price is negotiable cus some dealers dont negotiate,btohqsg
i saw one dealer their price really fixed  drop max 1k nia,btohqsg
but then their car condition good,btohqsg
I see... thank you for the advices!,btohqsg
sgcm can see dereg value as of today on the app dei,btohqsg
then just add body value to that,btohqsg
Must teach the math behind mag,btohqsg

HI guys  wanna know if PPI more reliable or STA Evaluation check?,btohqsg
many of us will not be able to own one as well.,btohqsg
Soon will not be able to own one,btohqsg
If u have a reliable workshop PPI,btohqsg
But not all dealers allow PPI by ur own workshop,btohqsg
so i requested for STA check instead,btohqsg
should i still request for this?after the STA Check?,btohqsg
But you went for STA check alr ah,btohqsg
u ask some of the honda bros here,btohqsg
sorry idk any  honda specialist workshops :),btohqsg
actually if u have doubts about the dealer  u shud just dont buy the car,btohqsg
dont let a $500 loss become a $50k loss,btohqsg
Yah recommended too. I driving a honda.,btohqsg
any idea how much does it roughly cost to do SKM PPI?,btohqsg
not sure if will too late anot  i sign agreement if STA check is graded B above  then everything will proceed as usual...if below B then they will cancel the deal and refund me,btohqsg
Dont ever rush into buying a car. Now outside so many car,btohqsg
my own ws cudnt fix my car. i had to go to a specialist. they fix it now no issue le,btohqsg
so i should bring to SKM for PPI on top of STA check better?,btohqsg
ok then i try askif dont allow i also bobian liao... i signed the agreement already 😢,btohqsg
Guys where can I buy this,btohqsg
Now that you've already signed this for sta  unlikely the dealer will let you ppi at specialist,btohqsg
No idea didn't pay attention to what model hahaha,btohqsg
Would be best if you can,btohqsg
Busy getting into the lot before the car in front,btohqsg
I think the charge for ppi is under 200,btohqsg

Unless the car has been crashed,btohqsg
Hard not to get a B grade for sta,btohqsg
Usually with you will only get tyres low on tread or battery low,btohqsg
Then get free battery and maybe used set of tyres from a dealer,btohqsg
That's the max you get from STA,btohqsg
Doesn't take a genius to infer from the rubbish he talking tho,btohqsg
U wudnt know if he dekitted bro,btohqsg
some ppl before they sell they dekit,btohqsg
cus dealer didnt pay extra for the kit they changed,btohqsg

But my favorite colour is white,btohqsg

Colour  body kit  steering wheel  shift knobs  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
Some colours just easier to sell,btohqsg
May not be ones favorite colour but they can make do,btohqsg
i think the usual ones are like grey white and black,btohqsg
Silver and black best for wrap,btohqsg
wrap alr means i dun need coat,btohqsg

Morning car enthusiasts   sgcatmart got this features - buysafe and Sgcarmart warranty. Is it worth buying used car with either 1 of these labels or just a marketing gimmick?,btohqsg

If you don't mind it's PI that is,btohqsg
just that i heard stories abt claiming warranty,btohqsg
Because of warranty issues at times and the resale value,btohqsg
Oh yeah recently some dealers ask me my car AD or PI,btohqsg
AD cars slightly easier to sell,btohqsg
And the ARF tends to be slightly higher,btohqsg
PI cars are under declared at times,btohqsg

If new card quota so low,btohqsg
Used car market naturally will flood,btohqsg
Cus some car owners will take the chance to cash out,btohqsg
Cash out but then COE continue rising,btohqsg
Plus some i think dealer really anyhow bid also,btohqsg
End of quarter need hit target so they just bid to register the car tooAlso have the PHV company still buying in carsTbh a lot of things contribute to the rise so I doubt it’ll go down,btohqsg
I dont need it go down. I just want it stop skyrocketing,btohqsg
I met a car dealer. He helped his client to do the bidding. Was a 6 bid 83k non guarantee. Guess what? The first bid and he successful gotten the COE under Cat A. The QP is 93k. The dealer company ate the balance of 10k. I wonder how they managed to get the COE so fast. Said low quota and high COE but they still manage to bid the COE for first try. By the way  the company is AD not PI.,btohqsg
I rmb open cat can hold fr awhile,btohqsg
Is everyone selling to owner? They cashing out?,btohqsg
out of 10 ppl who sell  u have maybe 20% cash out 40% upgrade 40% downgrade,btohqsg
What's considered high quota and what's considered low. Now I'm seeing cat As 400+,btohqsg
I think as referring like last time about 1k,btohqsg
eh wth march 2018 bad example,btohqsg
Cat A cost more than Cat B,btohqsg
Wow cat A quota 2000s vs quota 500s,btohqsg
maybe people go scrap their cars  the quota will increase. unless govt says scrap car  the quota remain same. then LL,btohqsg
also dun forget this company will surely going to push up the COE price further.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/comfortdelgro-to-buy-up-to-1000-new-hybrid-taxis-to-replace-diesel-cabs,btohqsg
I think now everyone enticipating 2028 (cause 2008  2018) to drop coe  they're buying cars that last till then. We should expect quotas to eventually ride a thinner band?,btohqsg
i thought taxi quota is separate from private \,btohqsg
is it? I am not sure. maybe any expert know about this?,btohqsg
bruh  imagine taxi and public buses need bid,btohqsg
Quota highs getting lower  quota lows getting higher,btohqsg
the fare also better decrease when COE low sia,btohqsg
Since 2012  taxi operators do not have to bid for a COE to register their taxis. Instead  they draw from the pool of Category E (Open) COEs and pay the Category A COE prevailing quota premium.,btohqsg
they still need approval from LTA though,btohqsg
don't think they can suka suka add 1000 new taxis just like that,btohqsg
the news article from 2012 says,btohqsg
they only can grow 2% per annum,btohqsg
