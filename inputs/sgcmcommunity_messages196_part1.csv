U know ah car computers that save your G force  save your top speed etc.I remembered driving a 911 with those features. God luck if police decides to fine for speedyou if they toggle that screen and found out no evidence of this car leaving Singapore. 😏,btohqsg
I think City Car Driving is a pretty decent game which mimics city traffic to a good extent & they have a driving test mode which is pretty good (tough). Euro Truck Sim is also very nice game  mostly driving European roads  more fun when you have right pc setup. Some mods include SG  MY  ID roads simulations.,btohqsg
Any one knows where to buy the wheel hub cap for toyota.  16 inch stock rims.,btohqsg
Anyone drive past the traffic light camera near orchid country club? I was driving usual speed like 60km/hr and I saw the light beeping  it beeped on other cars too...  Wondering if anyone has kena from this?,btohqsg
Even without OBD monitoring the speed  it is only matter of time before the advancement of technology is used to monitor speed and reckless driving.,btohqsg
The only matter is to see how determine the Gov want to do it,btohqsg
If they lenient like now  even if they can know every little thing we do  they also wont catch,btohqsg

Hi guys. Quick question for the seniors here. In your eyes  would it be worth getting a 5yr COE renewed Car? I'm looking at a 2014 CLA180.,btohqsg
Renew already won't get back rebate..,btohqsg
Renewed is just coe value when u de register + body value. So unless the price is okay  nope. given mkt conditions absolutely not,btohqsg
Better to get 2022 and before car,btohqsg
