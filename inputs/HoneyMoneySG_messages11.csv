Then when you scroll all the way down  there will be a figure in sgd as well as a service fee (also in sgd).,btohqsg
So i suppose it was in Chinese yuan first and the bank converts the amount to sgd and charge to my credit card.,btohqsg

Cos uob 1.7% citi need to redeem in terms of 50,btohqsg

Cash back from cc or revolut?,btohqsg
Topping up using CC doesn‚Äôt qualify you for the 20% cashback,btohqsg

Hi guys. I'm quite confused regarding the credit card minimum spend requirements. I've read different things on the subject so it's not very clear. Does the minimum spend required to be within specific categories or is it including all the expenses that are done with the credit cards? I read the citi bank cashback card document and I didn't really find it clear  not sure if the 800$ minimum spend have to fall under food  groceries and petrol categories. Any citi bank cashback card holder here who can help?Thank you!,btohqsg

As long within 30k annual limit,btohqsg

Only valid for 1 year.. If already past 1 year then it will be lower,btohqsg
Management fees of 0.65% would never make sense when one could get paid 2.18~2.5% by DBS/POSB to invest (would be even higher after factoring in the sign-up cashback).It might even make sense to double your current Invest-Saver despite maxing out the cashback cap of $30 every month.,btohqsg
Not much choices for invest saver though. My nikko sti is over 1 year. Not sure which to switch over to next,btohqsg
Can switch to Singlife. Oct will be 1.5%,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just get my revolut card  may i know link what credit card can get the benefits: DBSMWC  AmexTCB and UOB Absolute? Thanks,btohqsg

Morningg  anyone knows if paying for cruise port tax and gratuity are considered eligible spends for new signup creditcards?,btohqsg
Hmm interesting idea so if amex to grab to RevoWill grab earn points when top up revolut?,btohqsg
No points  only credit card cashback.,btohqsg
Until amex removed the cash back from grab top up I hope not,btohqsg
Btw anyone own 2 phones can revolt app install and run together?Like install bothA phone put at homeB phone for workCan b phone Login without asking for password?,btohqsg
Cannot. Revolut very strict one. You change phone they will ask you for selfie as verification. So best don‚Äôt log in 2 phones. Later they ban u,btohqsg
Maybe install but login when needed,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î ji pay accept grab top up I guess,btohqsg
if do amex>grab>revo>bank too much will kena ban?,btohqsg
Is it under unit trust? I cant find it,btohqsg
There's only 4 ETFs under Invest-Saver (not much choices like you said haha).,btohqsg
generally I feel it a better idea not to invest with banks...,btohqsg
Haha yup. Answered you last month as well.,btohqsg
Ah thank you. Cos the name doesnt have any C F or A. That us why Im clueless. üòÇ,btohqsg
Thank you and not much choice also,btohqsg
If a bank would pay me to buy a 'List A' ETF near/at its historical low  I think it's a no-brainer offer to take up.If there could be more choices  what would you recommend that's better or equal?,btohqsg
Sorry I dont have any recommendations. I only know STI,btohqsg
Whats the incentive to double the investment above posb cashback limit,btohqsg
Who got ji pay and big pay referfal code to share?,btohqsg
I want to be very transparent about this. Another reason for selling is because I'm no longer dca-ing into syfe wealth. My syfe trade is already much larger than syfe wealth + accumulating monthly. So i dont need Syfe wealth anymoreNot easy sharing such stuff online because people hate bears/selling outs  so definitely will expect hate comments from the publicAll in all  I'm just sharing what im doing and not telling anyone to follow like i always put in disclaimers. But ya  you can't please everyone,btohqsg
"Apart from the upfront gifts above  there might not be further incentives doubling STI  though it's still arguably a better investment than SYFE.If it's ""doubled"" by investing into the bond ETFs  the 0.5% sales charges still beat SYFE's 0.65%.If CFA  it's purely taking advantage of its current lows  and not missing out by limiting oneself to the $30 cashback cap.",btohqsg
Oh ji pay no free top up fee?,btohqsg
Big pay if u use grab pay top up got fee ?,btohqsg
got banned becauae they couldnt match my ID to my selfie  customer service didnt do anything to resolve also,btohqsg

Easy  as long as there is spending on other dbs cards,btohqsg
I only spend $1 to fulfill the Multiplier criteria though,btohqsg
Just cancel if they dont waive,btohqsg
don't think card cancellation affect credit ü§î (i might be wrong tho),btohqsg
IMHO the credit issue works as followsYou have an outstanding charge  billed. ( annual fee)You haggle with customer service and then cancel card without paying. The bank report a missed payment.The credit rating go low.,btohqsg

They are trash. The risk-free-rate products from the gov have been better for months and as usual the banks are slow to move. Why would I put in a 20k min for a 12 month lockup for a measly 2.x% when the T-bill for the same tenor has only a 1k min and yields over 3% pa?,btohqsg
+ AAA rating from the SG gov vs RHB's BBB+,btohqsg

I would use Citi Cashback+ 1.6% + amaze for this,btohqsg

Tonight i will talk about high interest saving accounts,btohqsg
T bills are similar to SSB?,btohqsg
T BILL the issue is liquidity. If you have to break due to some reson.  Very hard to sell.  In FD if you break yoi let go of the interest but the principal is back.But in TBill there is no market. As in you will struggle to find buyer and may be have to sell at discount,btohqsg

Have not tried so I cant advise but i would think that they would check your credit rating etc and they may not approve depending on how many cards you have applied in a short span of time as it may seem you are borrowing large sums of money,btohqsg
Anything less than 1000 SGD  can use citi rewards 4mpd with amaze,btohqsg
Yes but it depends on which signup bonus you preferE.g.Amex krisflyer $2k spend  27000 milesAmex krisflyer ascend $3k spend  40000 miles,btohqsg

Citi cashback 8% or maybank fnf*With amaze,btohqsg
Citibank cashback. I tried following the steps but the instructions seem outdated. I contacted the staff  they should reply me tmr.,btohqsg
Criteria to hit the 1.4% for the first $50k is to have 4/5 transactions spent using the card itself per month basis,btohqsg
Just the cashback card  not cashback+,btohqsg
As in anythingNot related to fairprice I bet,btohqsg
My Citi cashback dun need to sms,btohqsg
Citi Rewards card  better to take the gifts (singsaver - dyson hairdyer  everdesk or sony headphones; moneysmart - ipad  capitavouchers  nintendo switch) or the $350 cash?,btohqsg

WWMC but through Apple online store? It has a 2k cap if I don‚Äôt remember wrongly,btohqsg

If not have to manually count and tally üòÇ,btohqsg
You can chat the agent through the app,btohqsg
I asked if there‚Äôs a way for users to keep track on their own,btohqsg
They said no  just chat them whenever you want to check your remaining limit,btohqsg
I think 1 way is to keep all the amex card bill,btohqsg
yah after you hit 75% will show that,btohqsg
Thats genius omg. Never thought about that haha,btohqsg

Hello! Can I ask a quick question  RSTU cannot be withdrawn after age 55? Then what happens to the money? It goes into RA account?,btohqsg
Yes. This amount can be seen under the reserved wording link when I log into ur cpf acc,btohqsg
It only says part of your account as been reserved,btohqsg
So is the interest reserved as well? Does it go into my RA first?,btohqsg

Thanks for the reply... Oic.. why need SMS to redeem?,btohqsg
What is the best way to clear the dbs vantage 8k min spend for miles? possible to do with top up wallets etc?,btohqsg
hello  sorry I still dont get why we should use amaze card overseas when banks charge foreign currency fee. Would it be better to use YouTrip then?,btohqsg
Amaze converts your foreign currency for you at a low spread and charges your bank card in sgd. So you avoid that bank charge as amaze has already converted for you,btohqsg
oh nice  thanks for the reply. Can I pair the amaze card with UOB titanium card?,btohqsg
But whether rewards are optimised is a different thing,btohqsg
anyone have any ideas for this,btohqsg
Is there still incentive to use the Amaze card?  I.e. does linking MasterCards to it  still earn both the bank's benefits  on top of the Amaze's 1%?,btohqsg
Yes  it converts offline transactions to online transactions  so it helps u maximise cards like crmc and ocbc titanium mastercards. Amaze‚Äôs 1% is just the icing on top  not a big draw,btohqsg
Highly doubt topping up wallets would work cuz dbs is always the first to nerf too-good-to-be-true methods of earning miles. I could be wrong tho  u might need to comb thru the t&cs,btohqsg
I see. Just read that dbs cards nerfed for Amaze. Sorry what are examples of offline to online conversion,btohqsg
Oh understand now  some of the over the counter payments can now be deemed as online with Amaze,btohqsg
Hi all  i‚Äôve got a noob question:Is there any way a hsbc revo sup card holder can view their transactions in their hsbc app?Cuz at the moment it seems like only the primary card holder can view transactions of the sup card user  not sure if theres any way around it,btohqsg
So best card to buy overseas items online would be amaze cos of the additional 1% cashback,btohqsg
Hii! May I know which is the highest savings account (without needing to put your salary in or mininal monthly spend?),btohqsg
Do u have expectations on the % now Trust bank is 1%-1.2% for not doing much.,btohqsg

Thank you! ü§ó Have you tried putting money there too?,btohqsg

Is transfers counted in the 30k/year?,btohqsg
I have Syfe+ and am getting a decent return - but it‚Äôs not easy to say what the rate is as Syfe does not provide data granular enough to verify.,btohqsg

I think currently it's 1.9% which is quite high. Last year was 1%-1.2%,btohqsg

Hi! Is it worth the effort and fees to get a miles card for cardup payments? If so  which credit card would you all recommend ? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I am using  UOB Prvi @ 1.4mpd,btohqsg
I‚Äôm into cashback but thinking of getting a miles card just for cardup. Just don't know if worth it...,btohqsg
It's not a bad idea. Get a miles card where the miles don't expire  get their sign up bonus and just use it exclusively for bill payment miles.I'd pick a card with optional annual fees  like DBS Altitude,btohqsg
Will probably take a few years to get enough miles for travel though. Unless you've got some expensive bills,btohqsg

Hi I need some advice on my portfolio. Besides the srs dimensional on endowus  I am also currently on syfe custom (qqq  cspx  vwra) and syfe reit+. But I am thinking of moving from syfe to ibkr for the us stocks and to tiger trade for sg reits. Only have $1k per month for investment. Any advice on the allocation? Thanks!,btohqsg
your syfe custom same like mine and i am still lost +- 10% :(,btohqsg
Anyone knows how Tiger Vault works?How to get the advertised 9.9% and what is the optimal amount to put into it?,btohqsg
any recommendations for savings / debit account?,btohqsg
If you want to split between ETF and REITs  maybe you can only focus on one counter for IBKR/Syfe trade + a monthly REIT ETF for $1000,btohqsg
For someone new and who wants to dca using cash into s&p 500  the best way is to do via ibkr due to favourable exchange rates?,btohqsg
For new investors i would feel syfe trade is easier on auto invest feature. Ibkr have to do manual fx conversions and manual place order.,btohqsg
Or webull/moomoo is also good for zero$ trades,btohqsg
Get all the gifts first then decide later,btohqsg
From a cost perspective  ibkr would be cheaper but more hassle due to the manual fx conversion and placing of orders?,btohqsg
Yeaa haha and isit worth it to begin with?,btohqsg
Cheaper for large amounts.Small amounts doesnt matter,btohqsg
I mean if got gifts it's usually worth for the gifts only ü§£ but I dunno if anyone has experimented with it  like what is the optimal amt to put in,btohqsg
which is better for spending abroad? amex TCB + grabpay + youtrip OR citi CB+ w/ amaze,btohqsg

Hi guys  understand that 37 740 does not apply to RSTU and I will still get 8000 tax relief. How about topup through VCMA? Does 37 740 limit apply to VCMA topup? Can I still get 8000 tax relief if I VCMA 8000 after hitting 37 740 limit?,btohqsg
