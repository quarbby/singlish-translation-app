Desktop I’m not sure. I buy using app. The prices reflected are all in Chinese yuan. But when I confirm my purchase  the app bring me to a page where they first list the prices in yuan. Then when you scroll all the way down  there will be a figure in sgd as well as a service fee (also in sgd).,btohqsg
So i suppose it was in Chinese yuan first and the bank converts the amount to sgd and charge to my credit card.,btohqsg

For Revolut transport cashback of 20%Must you top up $300 and hold it for the entire month or just deposit (through debit card)  can withdraw immediately,btohqsg

Just dk whether it will lead to account banning if keep doing this,btohqsg
Cos uob 1.7% citi need to redeem in terms of 50,btohqsg

For Citi Cashback card as well,btohqsg
Think is $60 for cashback. But obtainable quite easily.1.6% u need spend 3k to get $50,btohqsg
Cash back from cc or revolut?,btohqsg
Topping up using CC doesn’t qualify you for the 20% cashback,btohqsg

Hi guys. I'm quite confused regarding the credit card minimum spend requirements. I've read different things on the subject so it's not very clear. Does the minimum spend required to be within specific categories or is it including all the expenses that are done with the credit cards? I read the citi bank cashback card document and I didn't really find it clear  not sure if the 800$ minimum spend have to fall under food  groceries and petrol categories. Any citi bank cashback card holder here who can help?Thank you!,btohqsg

Interesting poll result..if it's really based on interest rate  those who choose dbs over uob must hv spend over 30k per month. Or do I calculate it wrong?,btohqsg
most should be the 15-30k range... which is 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
UOB One is tiered..... anything below 60k not even 1%,btohqsg
"oh .. the new table not updated at their website yet... this works out to be 2+% on 100k... depends on your ""eligible spend""...",btohqsg
Everyone circumstances is different. Different loans  insurance  investment  and savings etc.Choose the account that best suits you,btohqsg

Stick to bank transfer or debit card. You prob can withdraw 300 immediately if its your first time but do enough times like this and you risk getting banned,btohqsg
Hm. In this case citibank master card also won't qualify for topup to revolut or youtrip also?,btohqsg
Or only grab pay is affected,btohqsg
i always maintain $50 balance only so after 300 top up but take out 250. seems like nothing happen so far,btohqsg
Oh revolut can get cashback topping up youtrip?,btohqsg

Guys  the fairprice evouchers can stack ? If using the self payment kiosk at fairprice store,btohqsg

Physical card  I always used that method. No problem 😂,btohqsg
A quick qn on revolut. I read they the account can't exceed 5k at the end of each day but within the day can go above 5k. Just want to be sure I interpret it correctly. Example I want to buy smt for 6k  I can top up revolut 10k and then pay 6k. Balance 4k at the end of day. Then ok ?,btohqsg
As long within 30k annual limit,btohqsg
ya  better bring this card next time...,btohqsg
but there is a extra fees if u convert or spend more then 5k a month for basic user,btohqsg
I was curious if can use via Apple Wallet. customer service officer says can but tried adding card to Apple Wallet  it failed 🤣,btohqsg

Only valid for 1 year.. If already past 1 year then it will be lower,btohqsg
Management fees of 0.65% would never make sense when one could get paid 2.18~2.5% by DBS/POSB to invest (would be even higher after factoring in the sign-up cashback).It might even make sense to double your current Invest-Saver despite maxing out the cashback cap of $30 every month.,btohqsg
Not much choices for invest saver though. My nikko sti is over 1 year. Not sure which to switch over to next,btohqsg
Can switch to Singlife. Oct will be 1.5%,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just get my revolut card  may i know link what credit card can get the benefits: DBSMWC  AmexTCB and UOB Absolute? Thanks,btohqsg
Just found out that Amex does not support in revolut card.,btohqsg
I usually Amex to Grab to Revolut,btohqsg
Morningg  anyone knows if paying for cruise port tax and gratuity are considered eligible spends for new signup creditcards?,btohqsg
Hmm interesting idea so if amex to grab to RevoWill grab earn points when top up revolut?,btohqsg
No points  only credit card cashback.,btohqsg
Until amex removed the cash back from grab top up I hope not,btohqsg
Btw anyone own 2 phones can revolt app install and run together?Like install bothA phone put at homeB phone for workCan b phone Login without asking for password?,btohqsg
Cannot. Revolut very strict one. You change phone they will ask you for selfie as verification. So best don’t log in 2 phones. Later they ban u,btohqsg
Maybe install but login when needed,btohqsg
Hmm 🤔 ji pay accept grab top up I guess,btohqsg
if do amex>grab>revo>bank too much will kena ban?,btohqsg
Is it under unit trust? I cant find it,btohqsg
There's only 4 ETFs under Invest-Saver (not much choices like you said haha).,btohqsg
generally I feel it a better idea not to invest with banks...,btohqsg
Haha yup. Answered you last month as well.,btohqsg
Ah thank you. Cos the name doesnt have any C F or A. That us why Im clueless. 😂,btohqsg
Thank you and not much choice also,btohqsg
If a bank would pay me to buy a 'List A' ETF near/at its historical low  I think it's a no-brainer offer to take up.If there could be more choices  what would you recommend that's better or equal?,btohqsg
Sorry I dont have any recommendations. I only know STI,btohqsg
Whats the incentive to double the investment above posb cashback limit,btohqsg
Who got ji pay and big pay referfal code to share?,btohqsg
I want to be very transparent about this. Another reason for selling is because I'm no longer dca-ing into syfe wealth. My syfe trade is already much larger than syfe wealth + accumulating monthly. So i dont need Syfe wealth anymoreNot easy sharing such stuff online because people hate bears/selling outs  so definitely will expect hate comments from the publicAll in all  I'm just sharing what im doing and not telling anyone to follow like i always put in disclaimers. But ya  you can't please everyone,btohqsg
"Apart from the upfront gifts above  there might not be further incentives doubling STI  though it's still arguably a better investment than SYFE.If it's ""doubled"" by investing into the bond ETFs  the 0.5% sales charges still beat SYFE's 0.65%.If CFA  it's purely taking advantage of its current lows  and not missing out by limiting oneself to the $30 cashback cap.",btohqsg
Oh ji pay no free top up fee?,btohqsg
Big pay if u use grab pay top up got fee ?,btohqsg
got banned becauae they couldnt match my ID to my selfie  customer service didnt do anything to resolve also,btohqsg
In case anyone is thinking of gaming Revolut.I've had funds of $4000 frozen inside for 5 months because they thought I was gaming the system trying to fund stock brokers. So  don't do it,btohqsg

I'm thinking of signing up for DBS Altitude credit card to get free airport lounge access. Wondering if it's easy to get the annual fees waived?,btohqsg
Apple express mode don't work in SG,btohqsg
U still need to unlock before tapOnly Samsung can tap without unlock,btohqsg
Ok sad and thanks for the answers ☺️,btohqsg
If u don't wanan tap and unlockGet apple watche,btohqsg
Easy  as long as there is spending on other dbs cards,btohqsg
I only spend $1 to fulfill the Multiplier criteria though,btohqsg
Just cancel if they dont waive,btohqsg
don't think card cancellation affect credit 🤔 (i might be wrong tho),btohqsg
IMHO the credit issue works as followsYou have an outstanding charge  billed. ( annual fee)You haggle with customer service and then cancel card without paying. The bank report a missed payment.The credit rating go low.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  what’s the best card to use for insurance premium payment? I saw that Maybank horizon visa has 0.4mpd,btohqsg

Which card should I use for transport in SG? Hope you can share? ☺️,btohqsg
I was trying to avoid getting a Apple Watch  not that is not good but trying to optimize all my spendings,btohqsg
Can try SC smart card for 6% cashback. Similar to hsbc there is no annual fee monitoring required. But just more cards to manage,btohqsg
https://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/publictransportpromo/Note the requirements to transfer 300 in *by Bank Transfer*  after using $50 I personally switch to ezlink (but I think there are probably better options),btohqsg
SSB rates for the 1st year already better ..,btohqsg

Hello guys   any kind word/beststrategy for foreign currency purchase (I.e. luxury bag in Paris)? Is it better to exchange EUR at Arcade and buy with cash better? Or use credit card better?,btohqsg
They are trash. The risk-free-rate products from the gov have been better for months and as usual the banks are slow to move. Why would I put in a 20k min for a 12 month lockup for a measly 2.x% when the T-bill for the same tenor has only a 1k min and yields over 3% pa?,btohqsg
+ AAA rating from the SG gov vs RHB's BBB+,btohqsg
And oso  any idea wads the effective tax refund rate for luxury goods in Germany?,btohqsg
I would use Citi Cashback+ 1.6% + amaze for this,btohqsg
Anyone know where is the best place to save money?,btohqsg
But not that kind of put in cannot take out ya. Just a place with higher interests and still can take out when needed.,btohqsg
Tonight i will talk about high interest saving accounts,btohqsg
T bills are similar to SSB?,btohqsg
T BILL the issue is liquidity. If you have to break due to some reson.  Very hard to sell.  In FD if you break yoi let go of the interest but the principal is back.But in TBill there is no market. As in you will struggle to find buyer and may be have to sell at discount,btohqsg
Is it wise to do citi cashback+ AND grabpay?,btohqsg

Quick question  what is the best card/app  for withdrawing ATM overseas during weekend?,btohqsg

Is it possible to apply for 3 Amex cards at once? I understand they work on a 1 annual fee basis,btohqsg
Have not tried so I cant advise but i would think that they would check your credit rating etc and they may not approve depending on how many cards you have applied in a short span of time as it may seem you are borrowing large sums of money,btohqsg
Anything less than 1000 SGD  can use citi rewards 4mpd with amaze,btohqsg
Yes but it depends on which signup bonus you preferE.g.Amex krisflyer $2k spend  27000 milesAmex krisflyer ascend $3k spend  40000 miles,btohqsg
Hi guys  I’m planning on getting a card for general spending but also buying honeymoon air tix soon and big ticket items next year. Generally a low spender 500-600/mth and don’t think it will go up significantly. Currently only have SCB Smart card. Interested in idea of miles/travelling yearly(w or wo using miles) but aside from air tickets/hotel spending does my expenditure make me more suited to cashback?Planning to buy tickets via skyscanner for 1) a bangkok trip ASAP and 2) honeymoon tickets earliest end of the month/next two months est 1.8k. I was thinking of applying for HSBC revo for a go-to card cuz of the versatility/sign up bonus and charge bangkok tix to it but noted from others that hsbc is slow with their approval. What are my options?Should I go for citi premiermiles first just to charge the bangkok trip and also use it for honeymoon following month or just cashback 😅,btohqsg
hm sorry for wall of text can remove if need be,btohqsg

Up to you. The 30k from citi includes 10k miles from paying $192 annual fee,btohqsg
Which card is this? Usually need send sms to redeem Cashback,btohqsg
Citi cashback 8% or maybank fnf*With amaze,btohqsg
Citibank cashback. I tried following the steps but the instructions seem outdated. I contacted the staff  they should reply me tmr.,btohqsg
Criteria to hit the 1.4% for the first $50k is to have 4/5 transactions spent using the card itself per month basis,btohqsg
Just the cashback card  not cashback+,btohqsg
As in anythingNot related to fairprice I bet,btohqsg
My Citi cashback dun need to sms,btohqsg
Citi Rewards card  better to take the gifts (singsaver - dyson hairdyer  everdesk or sony headphones; moneysmart - ipad  capitavouchers  nintendo switch) or the $350 cash?,btohqsg
You calculate the amount yrself. See whether selling at carousell justify the effort.,btohqsg
oof i see  okay thanks 👍,btohqsg
After sending back the redemption form to select your choice of reward upon cc signup.Is there anything we need to do upon hitting required spending  or just wait for reward to be sent over?,btohqsg

typically i pair it amaze +CRMC to get 4mpd for all spend less hotel and travel..,btohqsg
which card is the best for buying a iPhone 14 pro or similar? 😂,btohqsg
buy online with citi SMRT  5% cashback,btohqsg
Since >1k is above the cap for most 4mpd cards,btohqsg
WWMC but through Apple online store? It has a 2k cap if I don’t remember wrongly,btohqsg
Citi SMRT got no cap for 5% cashback?,btohqsg
annual limit of $600. so you have 12k of spending you can get 5% on.,btohqsg
can I claim the free rice and $10 referral voucher from trust without topping up anything? Like use coupon from trust but pay with another card?,btohqsg

Credit card interest rate is 24% p.a.  it is better to settle it,btohqsg

its been 2 weeks and i still havent received my amaze card sadly,btohqsg
on the app it should say  if not maybe can write in,btohqsg
Just add as gran payment method. U will at first get the notification for deduction of $1 but later shown as transaction cancelled. Don't worry. Check your trust app  the $25 will be there alr 👍,btohqsg
It will be a killer  better to pay off in full,btohqsg

Hello! Can I ask a quick question  RSTU cannot be withdrawn after age 55? Then what happens to the money? It goes into RA account?,btohqsg
Yes. This amount can be seen under the reserved wording link when I log into ur cpf acc,btohqsg
It only says part of your account as been reserved,btohqsg
So is the interest reserved as well? Does it go into my RA first?,btohqsg

Hi  is Citi SMRT cashback immediately credited or only given in the following bill?,btohqsg
Yes  like usual 5% cashback or 4 mpd cards will be better,btohqsg

Is 4mpd equivalent to 5% cashback? How to calculate?,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply... Oic.. why need SMS to redeem?,btohqsg
What is the best way to clear the dbs vantage 8k min spend for miles? possible to do with top up wallets etc?,btohqsg
hello  sorry I still dont get why we should use amaze card overseas when banks charge foreign currency fee. Would it be better to use YouTrip then?,btohqsg
Amaze converts your foreign currency for you at a low spread and charges your bank card in sgd. So you avoid that bank charge as amaze has already converted for you,btohqsg
oh nice  thanks for the reply. Can I pair the amaze card with UOB titanium card?,btohqsg
But whether rewards are optimised is a different thing,btohqsg
anyone have any ideas for this,btohqsg
Is there still incentive to use the Amaze card?  I.e. does linking MasterCards to it  still earn both the bank's benefits  on top of the Amaze's 1%?,btohqsg
Yes  it converts offline transactions to online transactions  so it helps u maximise cards like crmc and ocbc titanium mastercards. Amaze’s 1% is just the icing on top  not a big draw,btohqsg
Highly doubt topping up wallets would work cuz dbs is always the first to nerf too-good-to-be-true methods of earning miles. I could be wrong tho  u might need to comb thru the t&cs,btohqsg
I see. Just read that dbs cards nerfed for Amaze. Sorry what are examples of offline to online conversion,btohqsg
Oh understand now  some of the over the counter payments can now be deemed as online with Amaze,btohqsg
Hi all  i’ve got a noob question:Is there any way a hsbc revo sup card holder can view their transactions in their hsbc app?Cuz at the moment it seems like only the primary card holder can view transactions of the sup card user  not sure if theres any way around it,btohqsg
So best card to buy overseas items online would be amaze cos of the additional 1% cashback,btohqsg
Hii! May I know which is the highest savings account (without needing to put your salary in or mininal monthly spend?),btohqsg
Do u have expectations on the % now Trust bank is 1%-1.2% for not doing much.,btohqsg
Can request for free during application.Considering the number of ATMs though  might be better off transferring to DBS accounts then withdrawing.,btohqsg
Thank you! 🤗 Have you tried putting money there too?,btohqsg
How's the interface? And CS? Do they have a bank teller or its all online?,btohqsg
Is transfers counted in the 30k/year?,btohqsg
I have Syfe+ and am getting a decent return - but it’s not easy to say what the rate is as Syfe does not provide data granular enough to verify.,btohqsg
Syfe Cash+ does changes from time to time when they (SYFE) renew their portfolio.,btohqsg
I think currently it's 1.9% which is quite high. Last year was 1%-1.2%,btohqsg

anybody got hacks for paying fdw? haha,btohqsg
Ya UOB is always slow af. Even debit card also need 1 week to reach you,btohqsg
Horrible service. DBS is still the best 👍,btohqsg
They charge business more. Of course need to be best customer service to stay competitive.,btohqsg
Which savings accounts is the best to use?,btohqsg
UOB is out close company can't giro to UOB account,btohqsg
that sucks. hsbc is pretty good also tho! have been calling their hotline at midnight to ask some questions😂,btohqsg
Is better to cancel my syfe custom portfolio and transfer to syfe trade and buy voo and qqq manually? I seen chris do something similar in his vid,btohqsg

Hi! Is it worth the effort and fees to get a miles card for cardup payments? If so  which credit card would you all recommend ? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I am using  UOB Prvi @ 1.4mpd,btohqsg
I’m into cashback but thinking of getting a miles card just for cardup. Just don't know if worth it...,btohqsg
It's not a bad idea. Get a miles card where the miles don't expire  get their sign up bonus and just use it exclusively for bill payment miles.I'd pick a card with optional annual fees  like DBS Altitude,btohqsg
Will probably take a few years to get enough miles for travel though. Unless you've got some expensive bills,btohqsg
Is there other way to obtain free priority pass to airport lounge other than citibank premiermiles cc ?,btohqsg

Hi I need some advice on my portfolio. Besides the srs dimensional on endowus  I am also currently on syfe custom (qqq  cspx  vwra) and syfe reit+. But I am thinking of moving from syfe to ibkr for the us stocks and to tiger trade for sg reits. Only have $1k per month for investment. Any advice on the allocation? Thanks!,btohqsg
your syfe custom same like mine and i am still lost +- 10% :(,btohqsg
Anyone knows how Tiger Vault works?How to get the advertised 9.9% and what is the optimal amount to put into it?,btohqsg
any recommendations for savings / debit account?,btohqsg
If you want to split between ETF and REITs  maybe you can only focus on one counter for IBKR/Syfe trade + a monthly REIT ETF for $1000,btohqsg
For someone new and who wants to dca using cash into s&p 500  the best way is to do via ibkr due to favourable exchange rates?,btohqsg
For new investors i would feel syfe trade is easier on auto invest feature. Ibkr have to do manual fx conversions and manual place order.,btohqsg
Or webull/moomoo is also good for zero$ trades,btohqsg
Get all the gifts first then decide later,btohqsg
From a cost perspective  ibkr would be cheaper but more hassle due to the manual fx conversion and placing of orders?,btohqsg
Yeaa haha and isit worth it to begin with?,btohqsg
Cheaper for large amounts.Small amounts doesnt matter,btohqsg
I mean if got gifts it's usually worth for the gifts only 🤣 but I dunno if anyone has experimented with it  like what is the optimal amt to put in,btohqsg
which is better for spending abroad? amex TCB + grabpay + youtrip OR citi CB+ w/ amaze,btohqsg
Sorry guys to interrupt. Anyone know if in Revolut  if i have a limit exchange… where to i see that?,btohqsg

naise. i m going australia with it. thanks man. just want check for e-sim i just need to off my own data or remove my sim?,btohqsg
Don’t have to remove SIM. If you’re using iPhone it’s much simpler. Purchase and download the pack in SG. Activate before you board and when you arrive  switch off airplane mode and it will toggle. Make sure your primary SIM card “data roaming” is off,btohqsg

For VC3A cannot top up to SA only. It will be split into the 3 accounts.,btohqsg
Hi guys  understand that 37 740 does not apply to RSTU and I will still get 8000 tax relief. How about topup through VCMA? Does 37 740 limit apply to VCMA topup? Can I still get 8000 tax relief if I VCMA 8000 after hitting 37 740 limit?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  quick check for wwmc  online transactions get 4mpd regardless of the currency right?(assume trnx type is not excluded in t&c),btohqsg
