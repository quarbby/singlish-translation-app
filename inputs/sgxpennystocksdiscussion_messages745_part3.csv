üéâPika World Express Update: 16 December 2022üéâüí∏Equity markets spin downüî®There are many reasons for the decline  and investors are likely preoccupied with realising an actual recession looming. First  we have a hawkish Fed and hot inflation that is spicy. Then the retail numbers were atrocious  fanning hard landing for the economy and the labour market seemed firm with few jobless claims.Either of these reasons was sufficient to punish risk-on sentiment and sent major indices downward in both the pre-market and trading session.üí∞Retail sales show consumers' worryü©∫The significant drop of 0.6% in retail sales was the most worrying as it is far worse off than the drop of 0.3% we had expected. This market welcomes this news as the weakening demand help in combating inflation. However  on the flip side  it is likely to hurt corporate earnings.Yet  jobless claims falling isn't a warm touch for traders. The labour market is still robust  and we may not see inflation falling rapidly. This encourages the Fed to stay in the same tune as it always had since accelerating rate hikes.ü™úBond markets remain stableüíéEven as the equity market fell sharply  the bond market remained somewhat calm. Yields aren't roaring and are still below the multi-year peak of 4.7% for the 2-year Treasury bond. Yet  one may expect it to continue to climb  putting more pressure on the stocks  and investors will have to gauge the damage monetary tightening had on the earnings and economy.The bumpy ride is here to stay.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
