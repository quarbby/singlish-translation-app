i always check the tyre before i move off,btohqsg
Just make sure to do a Pre Purchase Inspection next time! With BMWs more things to check for that may not have been maintained!,btohqsg
Pressures can only check with an inflator,btohqsg
But just need to make sure the unit you get maintained well,btohqsg
one thing about elantra is that it will alert me if there's any issue,btohqsg
All the lights and symbols are common on all cars,btohqsg
Just the newer cars have a Multi Information Display (MID) that will give you a description of the issue as well,btohqsg
My kia never come out before sia,btohqsg
Maybe because I never whack the car before,btohqsg
Can also get something small like thisSerene,btohqsg
Tire Pressure monitoring system so that you can monitor,btohqsg
And also if you know how  canâ€™t go wrong with checking your dip stick once in a while,btohqsg
There's different ones on the market with different pricing,btohqsg
If you have a manual one that is  many cars now have electronic dipstick also,btohqsg
Have I been living under a rock,btohqsg
You have been living with VTEC,btohqsg
But I like to check manually,btohqsg

"Spotted a x6""m"" today. Member here?",btohqsg
Apparently you must kneel and beg to know it's him,btohqsg
"I thought with the ""m"" badge it must be him",btohqsg
The more i read the messages  the more i think he talks like someone i know,btohqsg
Oh! Maybe you know him then,btohqsg
Look around your friend group for people with BMW+Merc who would claim their have an x6m ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hahaha unfortunately i know no such person  but this guy clearly doesnt drive any of those,btohqsg
But there's definitely more people like Mr Se in this world,btohqsg
The other half as I like to describe them,btohqsg
LOL the other night u said the other half are iphone users  same half? HAHA,btohqsg
I would say there are many halves in the world,btohqsg
Possible  that's why ready to be back after getting banned on 2 accounts already,btohqsg

Could be the very same person for all we know,btohqsg
Ok but we do interact with him too,btohqsg
must see if the fella uses,btohqsg
Seems like it  but a lot more vulgar,btohqsg
But there is censor here anyway,btohqsg
Many times his messages get deleted,btohqsg
Plus he's more cautious after being banned the last few times,btohqsg
Anyway  I like the petrol head discussions here more,btohqsg
So don't mind putting up with Se,btohqsg
Anyway  early night for me today.,btohqsg
300msges with Mr Se  must be good entertainment,btohqsg
This termâ€¦ how do you know it? Unlessâ€¦ ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
"On second thought  i think i should erase the ""evidence""",btohqsg
