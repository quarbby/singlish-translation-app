so sometimes the fc not so good,btohqsg
like during my 3 second run down 99,btohqsg
This is true  i do feel the car is slow sometimes. But the earth takes priority over my need for speed,btohqsg
Look at this 2L gas guzzling hater,btohqsg
Treat your engine good so it doesn‚Äôt Trick you,btohqsg
Make it able to pop and bang and fast,btohqsg
Sounds like u should modify a vw,btohqsg
aiyo then dont buy car  walk!,btohqsg
Everytime step accelerator  can hear my wallet screaming,btohqsg
worse  more time to reach your destination = more emissions produced,btohqsg
Heard vw first thing to modify is gearbox,btohqsg
Cus the stock one is shit,btohqsg
I was told the golf r is good to go,btohqsg
Rx8 also fulfills your requirements since all u have to do is straight pipe it so the pops and bangs can be heard,btohqsg
Yea. The stock rx8 can pop and bang. Its very soft if the cat and muffler are still there,btohqsg
Anyone here still practises turning off aircon before shutting off engine and warming up engine before turning on aircon? ü§î,btohqsg
I feel like only old school drivers do that after reading some articles about 'modern' cars.. but i still do it haha..,btohqsg
Glad that im not the only old school mindset here haha ‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Only on older cars or cars with delicate ac compressors,btohqsg
But my main habit is to turn off the AC before revving out the engine tbh,btohqsg
The high rpm disengagement and re-engagement is worse on the compressors,btohqsg
I have a friend that used to drive an identical swift sport to mine. Except mine is 1 year older.He did the switch off aircon thing while i dont and he often scolds me for it.My AC compressor blew on the 8 year mark. Around 170k km mileage. And he kept making fun of me for not offing my AC before turning the car off and that his car's compressor is still fine.1 year later  at almost the same age (8 years) and almost the same mileage  180k km. His AC compressor blew.So morale of the story? It's not gonna make a damn difference.,btohqsg
Modern cars don't need to off ac for on and off cars.. but good to off aircon when whack.... cos can get more powerüò≥,btohqsg
honda fit or swift for first car is good,btohqsg
Haha ok.. it became like more of a habit rather than considering the outcome of turning off ü§£,btohqsg
taobao is your paradise if u took honda fit :x,btohqsg
i heard one extra vent can add 10hp,btohqsg
But hearsay if turn off aircon earlier before you park can prevent moulding ü´¢,btohqsg
tiagong their body kit can help u gain around 10 hp per piece...,btohqsg
if full body kit additional bonus 20% hp,btohqsg
Mine if I leave on when off engine  next time I turn key to on  aircon will on before start engine. Battery voltage less by 1v. So I off aircon when start engine  more voltage for the starter. Also off engine when VTEC or high rpm,btohqsg
Oh.. i thought the ECU will cut off a/c compressor during ignition even if u had it on previously.. then after that signal compressor to start.. ü§î,btohqsg
Waa then if u nv switch on engine u stil can get cold air üòØ,btohqsg
Off engine then it's just the blower,btohqsg
hi can someone help me find the owner‚Äôs ig? :),btohqsg
