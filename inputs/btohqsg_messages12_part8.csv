downpayment is 10% of the original flat price,btohqsg
oh is not count this way? hahaa everyone give me different info also ü•≤,btohqsg
just rmb to clarify w HDB in the end,btohqsg
oh so will be 400k - 40k (down payment) - ehg 40k = balance to loan from hdb?,btohqsg
you can use EHG to pay the downpayment,btohqsg
the grant will go to ur CPF ordinary account  just take it as it is ur CPF,btohqsg
then you can use it to pay off anything that can be paid using CPF,btohqsg
depends on how you wanna pay off your flat.you are required to pay the downpayment  you can use the grant  your own CPF or your own cash to pay it,btohqsg
How do they actually calculate the grant? Considering we change job in between with different salary,btohqsg
if work pt jobs  studying private school and working as Private hired drivers?,btohqsg
"though  precisely  what you indicated as ""hdb loan"" should be hdb loan + (your cpf oa - 20k)",btohqsg
^ and this also depends on the loan quantum you are granted at CPF. you may need to top up cash depending on your circumstances,btohqsg
Fyi  bank loan rate went up.. now for dbs is 1.36% fixed for 3 yrs,btohqsg
bank loan or hdb loan better now?,btohqsg
Not recommend floating as very likely 2022 n 2023 will go up further,btohqsg
that depends on your financial situation and plans  I guess,btohqsg
is it true if lesser cash on hand should take hdb loan?,btohqsg
if for any reason you cannot pay ur mortgage for a short while  HDB MIGHT be more lenient than banks.HDB as no early repayment penalty  banks probably have,btohqsg
banks require you to pay a chunk of the flat price in cash  i think,btohqsg
if you dont wanna touch cash at all for your house  then use HDB loan,btohqsg
provided you have sufficient money in ur CPF OA,btohqsg
25% down pay. up to 20% by cpf. at least 5% mandatory cash,btohqsg
Yup this is for 1st timer hdb loan might be better,btohqsg
For 2nd timer bank loan will be better choice,btohqsg
Due to hdb require 50% proceed to be paid before the loan u the balance,btohqsg
Hdb loan = 10% cpf + 50% proceeds from flat sold only den they will loan u the balance,btohqsg
Bank loan = 25% with 5% in cash and tat it,btohqsg
Also  rmb besides downpayment  there's also other miscellaneous fees such as stamp duty,btohqsg
Yup this one is regardless bank loan or hdb loan u got to pay,btohqsg
Grant eligibility requires continuous employment the 12 months prior to application.,btohqsg
As long got payslip  can show income  or got pay tax file IRAS should be ok for evidence as income.,btohqsg
"""The buyer or his/her spouse must also be in continuous employment for the 12 months prior and remain working at the point of flat application.""",btohqsg
So for a couple  minimum one pax must draw continuous salary for 12 months prior to application.,btohqsg

Yes. And the construction worker did say that this is the first block they started on but because of the multi storey carpark the block was put on hold and became the last to be completed. The worker mentioned it will take another 6 to 8 months.,btohqsg
