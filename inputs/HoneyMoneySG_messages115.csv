Time to find another card to replace HSBC revo. Any suggestion to combo with my Citi+amaze card ü§£,btohqsg
Bro. Hsbc revolution latest news came as a shock to me,btohqsg
HSBC Revolution nerf is shocking everyone!,btohqsg
Time to give up on a dead card I already stoped using it,btohqsg
Wah you got live update from mr Terry,btohqsg
Can just keep lor no need to cancel,btohqsg
Ya keep but no using it unless HSBC U-turn it haha,btohqsg
If we use HSBC revo card and insert into the machine to make payment  are we still awarded with 10x points?,btohqsg
Seem like OCBC mo sign up promotion,btohqsg
Now wee mostly Citibank's card got signups promotion,btohqsg
you were never awarded 10x pts for this before,btohqsg
I though insert card into the machine can transact as a payment?,btohqsg
1 year time can get SUB üòä,btohqsg
Any credit card that I can go for miles?,btohqsg
so basically its for online purchase only,btohqsg
Kelvin so nice to reply his every question,btohqsg
they're probably going to phase out this card soon as the rewards gets worse,btohqsg
Haha and ppl still think banks wouldn't do such a crazy nerf stunt,btohqsg
Exactly lol  that‚Äôs why my ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù question wasn‚Äôt without basis. It‚Äôs just a matter of when. I wonder who called CSO about the mcc that‚Äôs why they nerf contactless spending,btohqsg
hm  ppl also also mcc for online spending ah. Anyway dun think ask mcc has anything to do with the nerf,btohqsg
Someone mentioned calling CSO to check mcc causes nerf ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Is hsbc everyday account 1% bonus interest that need 5 minimum transactions including money transfer to my non hsbc account ?,btohqsg
Are there any SGQR apps that still work that can charge a CC?  Looking to pay at hawker stalls‚Ä¶ Fave and Shopback aren‚Äôt listed  so not sure what else is left ü§î,btohqsg
Amex pay. I'm having KF card so no transfer fee.,btohqsg
Revo contactless nerf but if I insist of asking the merchant to use the physical card through the terminal  do I get cb ? Sounds like a stupid qn but ya so how,btohqsg
contactless payment nerf is the most stupidest thing tho.,btohqsg
physical card never get to begin with,btohqsg
the illustration got put your example,btohqsg
It basically an online only card but without the option to link to amaze,btohqsg
Huh hadn‚Äôt considered Amex - UOB PRVI has an Amex version for 1.4mpd  and was thinking of getting PRVI anyway,btohqsg
I'm not sure amex pay can use with UOB amex. I think it's for amex cards only.,btohqsg
amex pay can only use amex card from amex,btohqsg
Uob priv can‚Äôt use Amex pay,btohqsg
Rmb that HSBC can transfer to krisflyer for free till Jan 2025. Collect rewards den zao!,btohqsg
Think now is 2.5 points to 1 krisflyer miles,btohqsg
No longer a min of 10k reward point?,btohqsg
Now got promo till end Jan 2025,btohqsg
Oh no. Oops. Haha u got till Jan to  earn. At least it‚Äôs not blocks of 25k right?,btohqsg
Min 25k i think  after that no need,btohqsg
For Citi payall when pay for town council  the name field is it suppose to be the owner name or other name also can ?,btohqsg
Min is 10k miles (25k pts)  not 10k points,btohqsg
Is there a reason my UOB UNI$ is zero? We've been spending on that monthly $500-1000 and hitting the min to get the rebates + One bonus interest but when I checked the app  there's no UNI$,btohqsg
Which card did u spend on? My uni$ seems more or less correct.,btohqsg
Yes I did. Is there a general min spend I need for uni$ merchants? I know some like giant require a min spend,btohqsg
UOB One card. Do the uni$ expire? Cos honestly I've only checked it recently though we've had it for 3 years,btohqsg
UOB One card earn cashback quarterly if you fulfill requirements. No UNI$.,btohqsg
Oh goodness üòÇ thank you for clarifying,btohqsg

If use shopback pay and use hsbc revo card to pay for restaurants  it should be considered online spend right?,btohqsg
So now travel 1 > hsbc revo ? ü§î even thought got annual fee need to manually waive,btohqsg
Neither. There are better options elsewhere.,btohqsg
Technically yes but where will you be shopback paying at? Kris+ technically should be counted as online too,btohqsg
Those outside that accepts like shopback pay n kris+ like u said,btohqsg
I think mcc still remains the same. So depends on what you‚Äôre spending on?,btohqsg
So i think revo still got little use... since more and more merchants getting that,btohqsg
But yes... mcc still matters at the end of the day,btohqsg
Isn't that considered as contactless ü§î,btohqsg
Nope... u are using online app which is considered online spending still... jus the mcc we cant avoid that,btohqsg
New business idea for fintech engineers  create something similar to amaze but for visa then y‚Äôall can earn big bucks le,btohqsg
Some people think no card present means contactless?,btohqsg
Well‚Ä¶ if heymax actually creates a card  not a bad idea for them too. Whenever someone spend on a merchant  the mcc code automatically updates their back end database  making their mcc search more accurate. This can even into details on different branch of merchant,btohqsg
You don't tap. How is that contactless?,btohqsg
don't think heymax needs any hinting for a card  making an auto MCC routing card was their initial goal,btohqsg
What does auto mcc routing card mean?,btohqsg
Pretty interesting concept but I think they still have to get MAS approval and license etc to have this launch.,btohqsg
With the card maximizer I think they are massively collecting all those mcc when we are spending on ü§î slowly fine tunning their backend,btohqsg
Yea I do hope so. It‚Äôs a great app just that the mcc data is not very huge  especially those lesser known. But the only visa supported seems like it will slow down the progress,btohqsg
Is the moneybull promo worth to put now? And if I were to put sgd and how much is needed to hit the 100k usd mark?,btohqsg
Gurus. If top up panda pay wallet is it considered as rewardable transaction?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  want to ask what‚Äôs the card that you guys will recommend for daily transport usage?- Don‚Äôt want to clock my UOB card cos I have enough spend on that- other banks card: Citi rewards  Citi premier miles,btohqsg
Just for public transport? SC smart,btohqsg
Hi gurus! I am new to HSBC EGA rotation method using 2 humans. May I ask for this month  when would be the best date to transfer our from acct A to elsewhere  and wich date to transfer in to acct B? Thank you for advice!üôèüôè,btohqsg
I am uncertain  becos if i transfer out too late  then will end up as balance for acct A for next month  and affect the incremental amount for next next month?And if transfer in to acct B too early  will affect the reference balance for next month.And somemore this month ends on weekends..Am i overthinking?üò±,btohqsg
U can do everything on 1st July. At 9am.,btohqsg
Hi  can hsbc revolution stack with amaze? Or no point?,btohqsg
visa card cannot stack with amaze,btohqsg
Uob count by single day balance for the promo.. so i tot it was same for the hsbc ega. üòÖ,btohqsg
Adb  Mab is same concept  just different way they name it,btohqsg
uob also count incremental wrt Mar MAB,btohqsg
Single day balance is used for qualification or referencing. But never used to calculate the amount of interest paid.That‚Äôs what a couple of jokers misinterpreted Cimb bonus interest calculations.,btohqsg
Not anymore. That's a last year thing ü§™,btohqsg
Thanks gurus for clarifying. So i shall do the transfer out elsewhere and transfer in on 1st july. Thanks for advicesüôè,btohqsg
Sorry one more query.. for a EGA account opened today  will a fall below fee be charged if its zero until end of the month? Shd i top up 2k asap and maintain it?,btohqsg
Hi all  like to ask the experts here. Is there a limit to how much maribank's mari invest account? Understand that there is sdic for 100k insured.,btohqsg
Mari invest not sdic  mari saving then is sdic,btohqsg
So not insured at all for mari invest?,btohqsg
Please note that no investment have sdic  mari invest and mari saving is 2 different product,btohqsg
U already said its invest... any word that relates to invest is not SDIC insured...,btohqsg
My qns is what's the limit to mari invest?,btohqsg
How much you have? That will answer your question,btohqsg
Is there any promotion for existing UOB card holder? I am looking at signing up for UOB PRVI MILES MC.,btohqsg

Hello can anyone here just help me clarify can i use my citi reward cards to pay atome payments and get the miles ?? Or should i link it with amaze and do payments to get those miles ? Thanks,btohqsg
Do manual payment with crmc instead of letting it auto trigger.,btohqsg
Anyone face this issue ?First I had key in the credit card A on the payment transaction page in Jetstar website  But when I type the card number   there got deduct sgd 1 and refund back the SGD 1But suddenly need add one more person for the air ticket  and I no proceed for the paymentAfter I purchase one more  person air ticket then at the end I use another credit card to purchase air ticket as the credit card can get the point to redeem some rewardThen three hour later   my credit card A suddenly have the transaction LOT INTERNET POLAND around sgd 700++I already dispute the transaction  is it able to get back this money?,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt sound related to Jetstar.More likely is you just unlucky get fraud transaction or your handphone got malware.Did u report to your bank already. If it is non OTP verified transaction likely can reverse.,btohqsg
I report to bank already but is it need to report police?,btohqsg
See what the bank says first. If bank requires police report they will tell u.So far if bank reverses there is no need to report police.,btohqsg
Hello gurus and shifus  anyone know the list of ‚ÄúEligible Transactions‚Äù for Maybank credit card NTB promo?https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/iwov-resources/sg/pdf/cards/applynow-tnc.pdftnc clause 4(b) say will define but nvr define. Drafting fail lol.For eg.  will membership signups (7997) usually be an eligible transaction? Many thanks in advance,btohqsg
Have you checked your card's t&c?,btohqsg
Imagine getting charged by LOT Poland airline for verifying cc on Jetstar airline website üò±,btohqsg
Confirm it's genuine Jetstar website right?,btohqsg
ya coz after buyGot the air ticket come out,btohqsg
"That's not how you check if it's genuine... Like is the air ticket is genuine too? Especially if the ticket ""come out"" on the same exact website.Make sure you verify your booking on their app or something. Stay safe üëçüèª",btohqsg
Report for fraud if u cant map the transaction to an invoice/receipt :),btohqsg
Booking Jetstar will have deduction and refund of 1$?,btohqsg
Jetstar apps can show the ticket,btohqsg
This when I type the credit card number (my phone auto put the information) then after that I check my sc there got show the deduction and refund la (2time ) as I fill up for 2 timeBut morning wake up the transaction is not show in apps ald,btohqsg
Hmmm okay  did consider this as well but just want to be sure  besides the ‚ÄúExcluded Transactions‚Äù in the card tnc refers to cashback or miles eligibility (versus for the purposes of NTB reward). Because for some cards like Maybank Visa Plat - insurance payments is not an ‚ÄúExcluded Transaction‚Äù for cashback but very typically  most NTB rewards exclude insurance payments as spending for the purposes of NTB rewards.Samsam and Melvyn shifu  apologies for my ineptitude - please may you perhaps lmk on what is ‚ÄúExcluded Transactions‚Äù for the purpose of NTB rewards if it is defined in that TnC  if you have read?Many Thanks,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to ask  if u use ocbc 360 to credit salary  do u find that the $ comes in later than usual..? Thank u,btohqsg
You meant salary coming in later?,btohqsg
Could be just suay that your card got unauthorised transaction. Even official website sometimes may be unsafe depending on the company‚Äôs security,btohqsg
Usually my salary comes in 14th  my pay day is 15th.,btohqsg
So i need to ask hr..?,btohqsg
Your company‚Äôs bank account might be with another bank other than ocbc  hence the time lag also,btohqsg
Any kind soul can enlighten me whether using Dbs altitude to pay for travel agency LGE travel entitles to 2.2 miles pls. Thx,btohqsg

When i use posb no lag,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your definition of ‚Äúno lag‚Äù,btohqsg
Maybe your company pay from POSB/DBS.,btohqsg
Thank u all for the kind replies. I receive pay on the day itself but typically earlier,btohqsg
My dbs altitude got auto annual fee reversal. Does this mean I don‚Äôt get 10k miles for annual fee payments? Is it worth it actually to pay 1.8cents per mile?,btohqsg
AF will also have gst so its 196. And no  not worth paying 1.9cpm.,btohqsg

No. That is under uob lady dining.,btohqsg
If you could suggest any good card to earn miles on public transport,btohqsg
Will you use this card for anything else? Spending on public transport alone will take a long time to get enough for miles redemption.,btohqsg
I was planning to spend on my subscriptions and fast food joints and get a supplementary card and ask my spouse to also use for public transports,btohqsg

Hi  I have a question.Will I earn 4mpd if I am using UOB lady (transport) for SPC petrol station?,btohqsg

For buying flight tickets on SQ which cC card earns the best miles,btohqsg
Hi  for Nex voucher promo  if buy 2 sets will get 2 x $5 bonus voucher? Cos the tnc put only can buy 1 set tho. But it seems like i can buy more than 1 set,btohqsg
Depends on amount and cards you have access to. UOB lady solitare can cover 2k or dbs wwmc can cover 1.5k amount. More than that  use uob kris flyer.,btohqsg
Thank youHow about UOB priv miles? Is this good?,btohqsg
Not as good as the other 3 options I suggested unless you are new to uob and want to hit signup bonus spend requirements.,btohqsg
Ahhh understood so UOB KrisFlyer is good :),btohqsg
Coz uob lady my cap at 1k spending per month,btohqsg
And what card is good for online spending like Shopee etcI was listening to the YouTube on pairing the Citireward to amaze card,btohqsg
Shopee Citi rewards or crmc is good. To oversimplify  online (key in card details) then use crmc directly. When offline  use amaze card linked with crmc.,btohqsg
Hi  is DBS vantage or UOB VISA signature or DBS woman's world card a better card to earn miles with cardup for rental with minimal admin fee? Thanks,btohqsg

Hey guys  am going to Japan soon and was wondering what the best card to use would be? My current understanding is that VISA is not as widely accepted in Japan compared to MC. Right now  I believe that Youtrip would be the best for card payments and also ATM withdrawals. Trust would then be a backup provided I find VISA supported ATMs. Is this true?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
but of course u may encounter banks that are not happy that you are just using them as a conduit to receive and immediately transfer out funds.. then u will get the account closure letter.,btohqsg
Not true that visa not wide accepted,btohqsg
Visa=Master. Amex is also almost equally well accepted.. just a FEW shops i saw accept visa/master but not amex,btohqsg

My Credit Card Strategy is SCREWED with UOB EVOL Nerfhttps://youtu.be/V7abk9f45BE,btohqsg
technically not a nerf since 2.88% is promotional interest üåö,btohqsg
Actually is buff. We know they ending promotion end of month  dropping back to 2.5%. Now they gave us light back to 2.7%.,btohqsg
Yeah well it seems very deliberate to be slightly above GXS 2.68%,btohqsg
No one will complain if got more money,btohqsg
Between GXS and Mari? I use neither lol,btohqsg
interesting you have an app that you dont use,btohqsg
Sometimes got shopee promos for maribank. But also can use shopee pay for most of them. Maybe you're right... Should delete the app,btohqsg
the promotion isnt even better than what you get on using credit cards,btohqsg
Gotta compare lah ofc. Anyway I used to get free delivery vouchers through Mari  but now I just deliver to pickup points or lockers (which is free),btohqsg
For every $100k  the difference is about $1.67/per monthEvery $10k  the difference is $0.167/per month.,btohqsg

Same sister. I don‚Äôt play ntb. By leaving a bank for months / year  you lose the monthly rewards that can be earned. As well as the risk you won‚Äôt get the same credit limit back.Cheap balance transfers are usually only offered to the long relationship customers.,btohqsg

Hello bro & Sis  I just gotten the earnmark bonus from UOB one Rising Phoenix promo. Basically my funds will be lock for the next 3 months?,btohqsg

Yep  exactly! I've only learnt about amaze and MB F&F like 2 months back from this group... Just in time for my short KL trip! I only brought 2 cards for this trip  and I will max out shopping category by end of the month in sg. Too bad all those genting theme park tickets aren't counted as entertainment else I could have gotten more cashback!,btohqsg
I don't even think I can complete 1 let alone 4 ü§™,btohqsg
Oh  I timed my car servicing to be in the same month as my trip  so I can hit more transportation spending... As for online fashion  amaze card is simply amazing... Converts all my premium outlet purchases into online fashion spends. Lol. Food  shopping and hotel (sadly no cashback) are my main expenses so after maxing the category  I charged some RM expenses to max the last category. üòÅ,btohqsg
Mean you spend almost $2k to get 5.3% cashback?,btohqsg

Hi all  would like to seek the experts' advice.  If i am booking hotel via agoda shld i use Amaze card (linked to Krisflyer uob) or use krisflyer directly ( have charged more than 800 this yr for sia ticket using the Krisflyer uob) . Will there be a difference if using amaze other than clocking the insta pts.,btohqsg
Are you booking in foreign currency? If not  then no instapoints,btohqsg
if you want the extra 1.8 mpd then you have to use UOBKF directly on agoda instead of via amaze,btohqsg
Sorry i dun understand. I know there is a 3mpd for krisflyer. U mean there is an additional of 1.8mpd ?,btohqsg
Can you earn 1.5% cashback on American Express¬Æ¬† True Cashback Card for utilities and insurance?I saw UOB absolute nerf the utilities recently,btohqsg
UOBKF has 3mpd for bookings from certain OTAs  agoda is one of them,btohqsg
hi all  i have 2 qn for uob krisflyer:(1) do i have to clock $800 spending before i can receive 3mpd for unlimited spending?(2) the annual $800 spending is for SQ/SCOOT  can i use 3rd party app like skyscanner and route through traveloka to fly with SQ/SCOOT  will this still be counted?,btohqsg
Any idea on how to clock the snack insurance portion when I at overseas. Utilities bills not yet up.,btohqsg
Ok what u mean is base 1.2mpd + 1.8mpd ( prefered merchant eg. Agoda). If i understand you correctly  i shld use KF directly even though foreign currency since agoda is prefered partner.,btohqsg
Hmm uob vS is it considered a blacklist mcc card? I cannot find those white list.,btohqsg
Did u managed to find out how to do step 4 of SNACK insurance? Try and try but idk how to issue $8 insurance,btohqsg
Yes for utilities and insurance  Amex TCB excludes wallet top ups (MCC 6540) and installments.,btohqsg
yes  additional 1.8 mpd only comes in after end of membership year if you fulfilled at least $800 on SQ/scoot spend within the year,btohqsg
Any idea on how to clock the snack insurance portion when I at overseas. Where to clock online. Utilities bills not yet up.,btohqsg
Only grab wallet bah.. I got the cashback topping up to Starbucks  nets motoring and coffeebean,btohqsg
yes  take note of the FCY/contactless spend requirement,btohqsg

Refers to prepaid wallets. Starbucks topups seems to code as Dining.,btohqsg

Meaning if i spent this month 800 on sia ticket. And next month i buy agoda hotel  i wont have the additional 1.8mpd ? I have to wait till i renew menbership by end of the year . Only then buying from agoda will then earn the additonal 1.8mpd ?,btohqsg
first  800$ then u get additional 1.8 right? there wont be backtracking of my previous card transaction before the fulfill of 800$?,btohqsg
officially the additional 1.8 mpd is only credited in one lump sum for all eligible txn  after end of membership yearthere are cases where people have gotten them 1-2 months before end of membership year,btohqsg
no  the $800 can be fulfilled anytime during the membership year. it will retroactively apply to all eligible txns made during the membership year,btohqsg
Ahhh ic. So it is clocked but it is not immediately reflected in our total mileage,btohqsg
nice  u are way clearer than any fine print or uob staffs,btohqsg
and the $800 can solely be from direct sq/scoot web purchase.got it.,btohqsg
can be krisshop also  if you have something to buy therekris+/pelagonot counted currently,btohqsg
just to note  if you're paying in FCY then you need to consider if additional 1.8mpd is worth the FCY fee of 3.25%,btohqsg
I just applied UOB privmile card. Worth it ? And how to maximise miles,btohqsg

If you have 1.5k worth of dining in June then UOB PRVI. 5mpd,btohqsg

Hi all  on tax matters  is there a rule for parent relief we cannot claim both side? I claim for mother in law cos we giving her allowances. For my mum who I giving allowance as well  I didn‚Äôt cos she has part time job. But for FY 25  the limit will increase to 8k which her annual pay is below. Thanks,btohqsg
It sounded like if we use amaze can‚Äôt get 1.8 mpd extra based on the thread earlier,btohqsg
I am happy if that is wrong,btohqsg
Sorry i missed out the earlier context. Uob kf 3mp for agoda is based on transaction description. Amaze with uob kf will change transaction to Amaze* so it wont give you additional 1.8mpd. For other cases of amaze + uob kf that uses mcc check  the combo should work.,btohqsg
You can use amaze + UOB KF for shopping  grab and dining overseas. In fact this is my default combination if my Citi reward is max out,btohqsg
That‚Äôs weird. So where would amaze and UOB KF won‚Äôt work? Just agoda?,btohqsg

Just received my latest HSBC revo bill. There is one 5812 transaction that wasn't even given the normal 1 point. What could went wrong?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs your first time buying REITs  are you sure you want to buy it yourself instead of going through robo advisors?,btohqsg
Can I check  therefore to optimise the $80k deposit  the steps are:1. Deposit $80k.2. Subscribe to say Fullerton SGD Liquidity Cash Fund (7 times of $1 and 1 time of $79993).3. Hold $80k for 30 days.4. On day 31  withdraw $70k5. Hold the remaining $10k for 90 days.6. On day 91  withdraw the remaining $10k.By completing the steps above  the total reward would be $20+$447+$70+$210=$747.,btohqsg
Into the account. You can then withdraw to your bank account  or sweep it into their SGD money market fund,btohqsg
Looks ok  but confirm with Moomoo CSO,btohqsg
Whichever is fine. Just thinking if it‚Äôs your first time  do you have the knowledge which to buy or sell.But it‚Äôs up to you,btohqsg

I assumed he has 2k as base balance before he transfer in 2k monthly.,btohqsg
Payment method? Still under 1k limit? Or is it even 5812 not 5814?,btohqsg
wah  how u track to know that is the transaction with issue and also the mcc.,btohqsg
Contactless. Under 1k. 5812 according to heymax. There was a grab ride transaction that was not awarded any points also. Regardless  there should be at least 1 point right?,btohqsg
I only had 4 transactions for that month. So easy to count/match the transaction to the points given.,btohqsg
Videos are all for entertainment  not financial advice.,btohqsg
Use the app to check  now they tell u the base point for every transaction,btohqsg
Sounds like that 5812 trx not posted in that calendar month  else would have gotten base points.,btohqsg
If not posted won't be part of his statement Liao..,btohqsg
"Ah didn't know got this function. I checked and confirm no base points rewarded for 2 of my transactions. But now that I do backwards calculation  it seems correct.I see alot of ""point aging base adjustment"" and ""miscellaneous - bonus"" on the app.",btohqsg
Also strange that the available points reflected in my app is more than the total points available in my latest statement. üòÄ,btohqsg

Is it typo? 1.8mpd not %.,btohqsg
get bonus 1.8mpd if whitelist mcc and fulfil min $800 SIA related spend in same card membership year  no 1.8mpd if whitelist merchant,btohqsg
I have a similar situation. Heymax when searched indicated as 5812. But when I paid it was flagged as 5814. I checked with heymax and they mentioned that some merchants may be using both codes depending on payment method (ie if you charge using paywave it may be 5814 while if you pay using ShopBack link to cc it may be 5812). So what u search in heymax may have a small chance be different if it wasn‚Äôt the payment method heymax tracked.,btohqsg
How you see it being flagged as 5814? Need to check with CSO? Even 5814 shld have the base points ma.,btohqsg
For anyone interested to try self initiated self transfer for OCBC 360 - salary crediting requirement,btohqsg
This was confirmed quite a while agohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/205582,btohqsg
Am using the ocbc infinity card to clock ocbc 360 account spending bonus qualification.¬† If I attach it into insta amaze  can it still qualify,btohqsg
Should qualify as part of your OCBC360 $500 min spend for 0.6% interest. MCC wont change when using Amaze  and OCBC Infinity's T&C does not exclude Amaze*.,btohqsg
any reason to use with Amaze? No benefit unless using for cross border/fcy spend,btohqsg
Maybe he feels good seeing the MCCs revealed in Amaze app (like me) ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Thanks a lot!  Thought there is some points system for amaze  or now no more and totally no motivation?,btohqsg
Seems Amaze can help add up the spending also easier to see total for the month,btohqsg
Points only for foreign currency spending iirc.,btohqsg
Oh got it... Forgot about that... Started amaze long ago but hardly use it. Will still keep Infinity linked to amaze  want to track the total card spent more convenient,btohqsg
for online fashion  since it's in MYR  does it count under fashion or MYR spend?,btohqsg
I linked my card into heymax which will show the transactions when charged. It was charged to 5814  but before when I searched it was showing 5812. My statement is not out yet though.,btohqsg
I should still expect base points. Then maybe my case was different from urs.,btohqsg
It depends on the order the transactions post date. The bonus for RM charges will only count towards the last category once you hit the limit cashback on any selected category. So if you RM charges were posted before that happens  it will count towards the respective category.Btw it doesn't necessary has to be RM. If you use amaze  sgd will be charged. I only use direct payment for RM just to clock the last category. All others I use amaze to avoid FCY charges.,btohqsg
For the SC smart credit card. Do i earn the 5.6mpd only if i use the card on simply go? Or do i still get the same mpd if i link it other digital wallet like Samsung and use it on transport like day to day bus and train rides,btohqsg
fyi  will start incur 1% amaze fee for local spending above 1k,btohqsg
So not die die must link to simplygo,btohqsg
Link the card to heymax can track the points and mcc liao,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a few questions.A bit of context  I'm looking for a credit card to get like UOB KF.This is because  I am new to work life and travel for work (One week a month on average) and have to book flights  hotels  transport and food. The expenses are all claimed back from the company.(Q1) Is there any other card i should look into?(Q2) Why is it good/bad?,btohqsg
Seems like still have many who don't know the understand the use of SimplyGo.All account based transactions card and Visa/MasterCard transactions when tapping on the reader are considered as SimplyGo transactions  whether you link to the app or not. The app is just used to track trips  check fares  claim fare issues  etc.,btohqsg
This is good info  thanks Trazora for usual good advice,btohqsg
Hi  do I earn 4mpd if I use my uob visa signature or dbs woman‚Äôs world card to book hotels in Singapore directly online? Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg
You might need to start reading up the updates on all the cards you own too,btohqsg

I tried looking for it online but is there a permanent way to link the DBS woman‚Äôs world card to the Kris+ up?,btohqsg
Bit of error in interpretation  for sign up promo  it's salary credit within first 2 months of opening  not salary credit for the first 2 months of opening. So if opened in Jun  latest by Jul must credit the salary.,btohqsg
Unless u only fly SIA  id say uob lady travel category or dbs wwmc is better. And if you are new to uob  consider their uob prvi for signup bonus.UOB KF is good if you only want to use 1 card. Thou multiple cards will get you more rewards.,btohqsg
Also if his able to hit the min $800 on SQ somehow  he could use agoda   Expediabooking.cometc too,btohqsg
One of the best 8% cashback cards now.,btohqsg
not sure what u mean  can choose from the cards u added to apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
No  Kris+ doesn‚Äôt save card details. It uses ApplePay/GooglePay for the payment,btohqsg
hi  i noted that for the save up level up campaign is only eligible for the first 1 500 accounts for each funding month. Is that anyway i can check this before funding the account? Does that mean there is a likelihood that i can fund the account and not get the $500 promo? Just thinking if it is more prudent to fund the account at the start of July given there is this clause,btohqsg
Never check TnC but I suspect the first 1500 probably based on registration. Since e amt not lock  will only know who fulfil e requirement after 3mths and then give to first 1500 registrants who fulfil the requirements,btohqsg
Definitely got chances of not getting e money. Don't really have a sensing how popular this stepup bonus is. If locking money not an issue  might as well do UOB promo in jul  if any.,btohqsg
Yes  I read again and you are right,btohqsg

Depends on your card t&c  promo fee and extra fee on ipaymy.,btohqsg
Hi  for ocbc 360 account  to get 4.05% pa  needs to include save criteria also. But if i max the account out to 100k this month  then on the next month  i wont be able to hit the save criteria? Cos save criteria needs to increase avg daily bal by $500. If i put beyond 100k then not worth already mah,btohqsg
No. It will be up to 50% of the tier you can hit.,btohqsg
I see that ipaymy mainly is visa which get lower recurring fee  how about if I hold Mastercard?,btohqsg
That's what I'm thinking as well ü§£ thanks!,btohqsg
Some cards block ipaymy instead of cardup. Remember that ipaymy charge flat fee as well. Calculate with excel to be sure.,btohqsg

7-bank ATMs do not have withdrawal fees for mastercard. I don't believe there are any atms with fee-free withdrawal for visa,btohqsg
Ah  I guess that checks out. If only there was a MC version of TrustüòÇ,btohqsg
correction: apparently there's some DP that AEON atms have fee free withdrawal for visa. worth a try,btohqsg
As in the unlimited atm withdrawal aspect of Trust,btohqsg
regardless still good to bring trust card since youtrip has only $400 limit (unless you multiplayer and have a few cards) and if you withdraw a big amount it's only 220yen fees max at 7-bank atms,btohqsg
What  how did you find that. Couldn't find that in google. But I'll take a look thanks man,btohqsg
You not planning to bring any cards or change money beforehand in sg before travelling?,btohqsg
Make sure is mobile contact less  apple pay/samsung pay/ google pay those,btohqsg
When u say visa widely not accept there was no mention of fee in the first place. The acceptance have nothing to do with fee from your comment isnt it,btohqsg
I'm bringing rev  youtrip  trust etc.,btohqsg
Yea  that's my bad then. Do you withdraw any cash in Japan?,btohqsg
you probably won't be using revolut much unless you need more cash than the youtrip limit since youtrip's JPY rates are hard to beat.consider bringing amaze too. you don't plan to use any credit cards?,btohqsg
So your main point is just for cash withdrawal and 0 fx fee? And not any credit card rewards?,btohqsg
I alr have plans for credit card payments. My only concern now is withdrawing cash since apparently you can only top up SUICA using cash?,btohqsg
physical suica  yep. if you have apple pay suica then you can top it up using apple pay,btohqsg
You guys don't withdraw cash in Japan?,btohqsg
They gonna introduce the SUICA on android in 2025 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
keep waiting üòÅ the tech is there but only activated on japanese androids,btohqsg
doubt it's a priority for google at this point,btohqsg

Hi  anybody know for higher foreign transactions spend (USD2 000 to USD5 000)Is an amaze + general spend card (Citi Prestige etc.) or Trust card/Youtrip will have more cost savings?,btohqsg
How much do u value ur mile?,btohqsg
I think about 1.10 to 1.90c/mile  üòÖ,btohqsg
Take 1000 sgd amount as example.With amaze (2% fee) hence 1020 total. 20$ fee for 1316 miles (valued at 14.5$ at 1.1cpm)Without amaze (bank 3.25% fee) hence 1032.5 total. 32.5$ fee for 2065 miles (valued at 22.75$ at 1.1cpm)Youtrip/trust is better in this case.,btohqsg
Ofc I ignore the amount will contribute to Citi prestige limo rides. You can plug 1.9cpm and redo the calc,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony  really really appreciate the response !,btohqsg
use citi rewards directly on health buddy app,btohqsg
If you are very sure about the spending  you can try to research iChange. They do offer you the option to exchange SGD to USD in advance (similar to Youtrip). The exchange rate can be better than Interbank rate,btohqsg

Whether I can add it to Google or Apple pay and use mobile contactless to pay for Bus/MRT?,btohqsg

When you setup on CardUp  they provide you with all the info you need. Ideally the previous month on 12th.,btohqsg
Yea probably they just don‚Äôt bother to search,btohqsg
Good deal. Spend $250 and get $250 cashback?Use it for daily bus and mrt transport.,btohqsg
Do you guys income tax with cardup split to many months or just pay in one short  I feel pay once is easier and not to think much in the future,btohqsg
Your cashback is for what transaction?,btohqsg
Those with DCS and Union QR can pay. But app discontinuing already.,btohqsg
I not using dinersSGpay lah .,btohqsg
looks like the dcs card app can do unionpay payments directly,btohqsg
Of course split lol. 0% interest  get to clock spending for certain cards. You have more breathing space for your cashflow.,btohqsg
Hi All.. Good afternoon...Yesterday I have a gathering with my ex colleagues.. We are arguing whether we should pay off our mortgage early or take our own time to pay off.,btohqsg
Yes. Usually if SGQr have xnap would have Amex pay and DCS as well,btohqsg
Ohh So only the unionpay version of dcs works,btohqsg
Nowadays I started use amex more cos I signed up with 3% CB. Seldom use DCS,btohqsg
https://dcscc.com/dcs-cards-app#QR-paymentWith the link explanation is better. Only UnionPay with UnionPay QR supported.,btohqsg
1st scenarioMy ex colleague have a 2nd home.. and the tenant is paying the mortgage.. He feel it is a must to pay off the mortgage asap as the interest rate interest.  But we argue that he will still have to pay income tax in the near future... Do you agree?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think any good card  i plan to use prvi  which is no different pay it monthly or annual  I know get free cash flow to put in bank for interest,btohqsg
Any card that net cashback/miles with CardUp is a good card.,btohqsg
Hi all masters here  i hv a doubt. I hv uob one account with uob lady spending with $500 now. I took part the uob big saving using uob one account.Could I apply another UOB lady account with $20k deposit to get uob big savings and also additional miles of 2 UNI$?So both UoB ONE accoutn and UOb lady accoutn will base on one same uob lady spendings of $500 only..Any prob?,btohqsg
2nd Senario..He should use the money or invest SRS for share then putting in the mortgage.. we told him but he feel that at age of 40..he shouldn't have too much commitment,btohqsg
Should not put 20k. 10k is enough. 0.05% p.a. is a very horrible rate. And no  if you already take part in the promo you cannot take part again.And to be net positive for the 2mpd on Lady's Card (not Solitaire)  you have to spend 1k not only 500.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no right or wrong in both scenarios. There‚Äôs nothing to agree or disagree about.If his investment yield a higher rate than his loan interest rate  then sure. But he can still pay it off early then any future cash flow he gets can still be put into investment. Don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs the conflict here. It‚Äôs just a chicken and egg issueWhats the link between income tax and paying off mortgage?,btohqsg
That's from 2 months ago. The next promo is in Jul  if there is.,btohqsg
Depends on the interest rate obtained,btohqsg
Does anyone know if uob krisflyer has a cap on spending for rewards? Tried looking at terms conditions but didn‚Äôt see it,btohqsg
does does shopback accept instarem ? so i can stack citi reward + instarem + shopback for additional cashback,btohqsg
Any datapoint on how often those upsized cashback (eg 6% becomes 15% for Klook) happens?,btohqsg
Mine is solitaire. So $500 per mth. In that case  perhaps i just put 10k to earn extra 2 miles. Thxxx,btohqsg
no instarem points for local spend  conversely may incur 1% fee if exceed 1k local spend in the month,btohqsg
You might need to calculate the breakeven point for the miles  depending on how you value miles too. I might be wrong but anything below 1k is not worth the opportunity cost. Ideally 2k.,btohqsg
"Reported as two seperate trips. VISA does report as two transactions (so two ""SimplyGO"" records for the same date)",btohqsg
As long verified against SimplyGo app it's fine. On the same day if you make 2 separate trips on the same card  it's still considered 1 transaction.,btohqsg
It consolidated to 2 trips. Which is correct üëçüèª,btohqsg
Ya if your consolidate means like that hahaha.,btohqsg
Yup if it's not consolidated it will be 4 trips with missing exits. So good news we know they actually take the virtual card number into consideration.,btohqsg
Ah.. ya ya is consolidate. They treat as unique trip,btohqsg
Technically 1 card can share across family,btohqsg

Quick check expertsFor utilities such as SP bills and telco like singtel/starhub/m1CRMC linked with amaze can earn 4mpd ?,btohqsg
Is there any other cards that gives high mpd?,btohqsg
Quick check on the Citi Rewards + Amaze card  let‚Äôs say if I make a purchase overseas with the the Citi Rewards card via Amaze  there are no foreign transaction fees and I will only get charged for the item I buy (converted to SGD)? Will this transaction be eligible for the 4mpd too?,btohqsg
No foreign transaction fee  but amaze spread is about 2%.Will get 4mpd if you aren't paying for travel/mobile wallets.,btohqsg
Yup. As the mobile wallets will generate a new virtual card number every time.,btohqsg
citibank cards exclude utilities  telco ok,btohqsg
Hi have questions  if I set my Citi rewards to pay for Telco such as Simba(auto payment) does it qualify for 10x points?,btohqsg
I remember it needed to be manual payment. If recurring cannot. I think ah. I forgot. I usually go down to singtel and pay using amaze,btohqsg
Never use amaze card overseas if a refund is possible...I paid my hotel and applied a refund on same day  but paid $560 got only $551. An exchange rate was applied.,btohqsg
different exchange rate between paying and refundingü•≤,btohqsg
Not sure abt others but singtel kiosk mcc is 5999. So amaze+crcm works,btohqsg
That will apply for all card. But do note do not use amaze card for hotel security deposit hold. Always use other bank cc,btohqsg
You mean I can never get a full refund as long as I paid overseas?Is there any ways to avoid it?,btohqsg
You may get more. It always depend on the exchange rate on the time of the refund.,btohqsg
If u choose to pay in foreign currency it will always be suject to currency change  buy/sell rate always have a spread,btohqsg
There is 2 exchange rate I think? One is for buying  another is for selling. Selling rate is always lower than buying rate  so if I pay and refund on same day  I will always get lower refund  right?,btohqsg
Yes correct even for same day,btohqsg
99.9% of the time is lower. But if you lucky enough for the fx spread to go crazy and work in your favour then congrats,btohqsg

Okay  so meaning can use CRMC directly on telcoDont need go through amaze  correct?,btohqsg
I think it also depends on how you pay also.I think there‚Äôs some data point referring that you need to key in the credit card details manually to trigger as a online payment in the appI think u can do a search  should have some answers ard,btohqsg
I have a question at the back of my mind pls if you‚Äôll can help answer. You see  many people are so disgruntled about the funds in RA (for Standard Plan) going into the pool; interest and all.But I understand that interest earned till 65 or until a member start draw down is our money from where we draw monthly payout correct?The interest that goes to the pool is only interest earned when we start our CPF LIFE correct. Wonder if anyone will be able to calculate how much interest will go to the pool taking an example of someone in Standard plan with FRS example.I think most people are not very clear on that. I also. Thanks,btohqsg
Most of the private clinic in general is 8099. From what I know. Hope it helps,btohqsg
No options yet. Planning to get another similar 4mpd,btohqsg
RA is RA  CPF LIFE is CPF LIFE. There's no Standard Plan in RA but you can opt to choose Standard Plan for CPF LIFE when you opt to start payouts.If you are automatically enrolled into CPF LIFE  you can opt to start payouts from ages from 65 to 70. When you opt to start payouts  you can choose one of the 3 plans available. Choosing Standard Plan (by default once reach 70) will result in 100% of your RA consumed for CPF LIFE.Interests earned with RA will be returned to RA while interests earned with CPF LIFE will go into CPF LIFE pool.All of the above info can be found onCPF website.P.S. there's no real benefits to take any plans outside of Standard Plan or after 65.,btohqsg

Hi guys  I'm new to this community  wanted to hear from gurus on advices. I'm reaching FRS soon and I'm planning to use excess balance from 20k in OA to buy t-bill. Is it wise to keep buying t-bill (if the interest rates are favourable) so that I can hit ERS? Or else  what should I do with the excess in OA?,btohqsg
no mentioned on insurance when i search through the TnC.,btohqsg
Insurance is not excluded but  the question is more of who accepts AMEX for recurring premiums?,btohqsg

I m new to citi rewards points  how do i check if my specific txn earn me the necessary 4mpd points? I know we can check MCCs and etc.. just want to verify that sometimes the txn garners me the necessary points as well. Anyone know where in the app i can check this? Or i have to memorise the total number of points i have?,btohqsg
There used to be a rewards portal to check  but I don‚Äôt think you can do so transaction by transaction anymore after the portal was removed,btohqsg
ic.. then can share whats the next best way to track or monitor the various txns? The idea is to do a simple check and not being short changed.. anyone knows?,btohqsg
I think it can only be done on an aggregated basis when you receive your statement each month,btohqsg
Manually add the pts urself. Else can ask the chat but that needs to wait a bit.,btohqsg

Hi guru  wanted to ask if it is very common for Citi card to have fraudulent transaction? Just opened CRMC 2 months ago and been using it with amaze.How long does the replacement card take to get mailed to you? Because CRMC is my main card with the other cc being HSBC revol and UOB Evol. If is worth it get a backup standby card in the event citi cards have fraudulent transactions again in the future?,btohqsg
just wanted to ask  is the moo moo cash plus still on going?,btohqsg
For this only meant for new to band customers where they dun have any saving account?  How long consider as new customers after previous cancellation? 12 months?,btohqsg
What is the amt u intend to spend,btohqsg
Did a search and went online but it wasn't clear so have to try my luck and ask here. If I were to open an HSBC ega account today and sign up for the latest offer I suppose for the additional 1% interest. May I ask how would the interest be calculated please? My May average balance would be 0 and I am hoping to withdraw it before the end of July assuming that uob has an offer for fresh funds for the next quarter on 1st July.2) Am I also right to say that I can fulfill the 1% additional interest by doing 5 fund transfer to say my posb account please?Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
My exp is that citi sent new card within 3 biz days. You already had other cc. Unless you have specific mile accumulation goal in mind  no need new backup cards.,btohqsg
Quite common along with UOB cards as well.,btohqsg
#DP#UOBKFCC#UOBKrisflyer CCI am glad to be able to be the confirmed DP that Amaze + UOB Krisflyer CC can indeed clock the $800 SIA Group spending requirements for UOB Krisflyer Credit Card.,btohqsg
yes. And need to sms register for 3.4%,btohqsg
So u pay in fcy or the 1 percent extra fee?,btohqsg
it was a JPY transaction  hence i tagged on Amaze.If it was in SGD  I would have use UOB Krisflyer CC naked,btohqsg
At least u add to the data point,btohqsg
"Thank you but could I check if I would get the ""full"" interest if I were to transfer what I have to my uob account say on the 29 or 30th July please?",btohqsg
Why not just wait for end of Jun to open and deposit for Jul? Then on the last day of Jul deposit to UOB for the promo  if there is one.Anyway if your money is still in UOB right now  the monies that's still in account would be invalid for incremental fresh funds already.,btohqsg
yeah honestly i was unsure myself..because CONFIRM Amaze + UOBKFCC at OTA won't work.and i had to 'try it' anyway since the $4k transaction cannot be handle by UOB Lady or any other card due to max capTO BE CLEAR  this works at SQ doesn't mean it will work at Scoot ah.. BE WARNED.,btohqsg
No. The moment you deposit late or withdraw early  your MAB will drop based on the number of days your monies is in or not in the account.And depositing early (before the start of the month) will also affect the incremental MAB calculations for Everyday+ Cashback reward.,btohqsg
For Jun get full 3.4%+1 on Jun Monthly Average Balance (MAB)For Jul get 3.4% on Jul MAB and 1% on the incremental MAB compared to Jun MAB.,btohqsg

no  visa card cannot link to Amaze,btohqsg
Citi smrt is visa  can‚Äôt link to amaze,btohqsg
Oh ok. So it only works with mastercard. Got it. Thanks a lot,btohqsg
Yes  just recently get uobkf and prvi too,btohqsg
Yeah  seems like it‚Äôs a risk and hassle to always check if Amex is accepted,btohqsg
Very fast approve if existing uob card user,btohqsg
Ya. My experience was 3-5 min for approval then 3 days to get the physical card.,btohqsg
Yes indeed  just cancel Evol  yes good idea to get VS,btohqsg
Even with nerf  evol is still a decent card haha  just that minimum spending catch up with frank and livefresh haha,btohqsg
Already not use evol for many months  so just cancel rather ask for annual fee waiver,btohqsg
I just keep card as long as got waiver  never know when the card will come in handy haha,btohqsg

Just signed up for EGA June bonus interest at 3.4% Wondering what‚Äôs the best way to optimise interest savings between OCBC 360 (3.2%) & HSBC EGA account (3.4+1%)?(Usually 360 is my main account  when isit best to trsf out considering both accounts follow daily avg balance?),btohqsg
Hmm even if my ocbc earn rate is only 3.2%?Or should I ‚Äúzero out‚Äù from OCBC and just earn 2% on DAB thenEarn 4.4% from HSBC?,btohqsg
Not 3.85%? You don't intend to meet spend? Then you should probably replace OCBC 360 account with SCB eSaver instead.,btohqsg
Nope haha have alway just been getting 3.2 because I don‚Äôt use ocbc cc üòÇ,btohqsg
Then you are better off putting somewhere else already,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is 3.6%-3.8%pa if you meet salary and save requirements. This includes reset month.,btohqsg
Thought the difference not alot plus esaver promo is only for 2 months so not worth the hassle to go create one,btohqsg
Less than 75k it's 3.25% p.a.,btohqsg
Holding only abt 10-20k in the account,btohqsg
So far they have constant promo monthly,btohqsg
"Hi gurus  may I check for ""reset month"" for ocbc 360  can I withdraw my funds at the start of the month or after the interest credit date so that I'm still eligible for last months interest?",btohqsg

Are you using a card that excludes SimplyGo MCC????????,btohqsg
