🎉Pika World Fed Review – 26 August 2022🎉🎙Uncle Powell: Reasons for Surprise💰As Uncle Powell speaks at Jackson Hole today  investors will be bracing for a rough ride. He will likely reiterate the commitment to fight inflation even as the latest CPI data showed the annual rate falling to 8.5% from a peak of 9.1% just a month ago. Inflation is still too high compared to the Fed’s target of 2%.He will likely reaffirm his stance that the FOMC has to see continuous cooling off in prices. Yet  there are possible reasons for Uncle Powell to sound a tiny bit dovish.🛎#1: The JH Symposium: Big Annoucement🔋There is no doubt that the event has always been a platform for a significant announcement. Two years ago  we saw the Fed's new inflation framework supports a potential overshoot of the inflation target after a long period of low inflation.💡#2: Consistent interpretation of message has been the key🧰While some economists had warned that the message was somewhat not conveyed in the right tone and predicted that the FOMC minutes would have a more aggressive hawkish tone  it turned out not to be the case.It is reasonable for us to assume that the since the Fed officials had not to tap on July’s minutes to re-align the market’s expectation  Uncle Powell may avoid pricking that nerve during his coming speech. Instead  he will likely reinforce the need to review incoming data  focusing on August CPI data and job reports before the next FOMC meeting.🍄#3: Markets should consider the Balance Sheet Reduction✂️Another possible reason for more dovish is that the Fed is about to go into full force for tightening its balance sheet. The effect is unpredictable and will become more potent in September as the tightening is heightened. This may be a strong force in reducing economic demand.With that  such a quiet giant movement may be sufficient for the Fed to be less aggressive on the rate hike to achieve the ultimate aim of reducing economic demand.Regardless of all predictions and analysis  the flip side could be true if Uncle Powell spoke about a more restrictive policy stance for extended periods. Unfortunately  the market isn’t ready for such a message.The last policy meeting was somewhat dovish. During the press conference  Uncle Powell spelt out a dovish tone despite raising the rate by 0.75% during its July meeting. He pointed that future rate hike could moderate as he saw a slowing economic demand given that recent aggresive rate increment has been out of a normal cycle.📪What's on the menu today?📖At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Core PCE Price Index  which we expect growth of 0.3%  down from 0.6% in the prior period.Jackson Hole Symposium will begin at 9 pm  and Uncle Powell will deliver his speech at 10 pm. It is likely to be a market mover.It is 26 Aug  Friday at 9.12 am in Singapore and 9.12 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a cooling and recharging weekend.,btohqsg
