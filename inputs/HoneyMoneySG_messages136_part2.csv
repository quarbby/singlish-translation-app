Will OCBC 360 Credit Card give cashback for Simplygo transactions and paynow transactions to hawker etc?,btohqsg
OCBC 360 is the worse credit card in Singapore. Change to other credit card,btohqsg
I'm looking for a credit card and savings account combo to maximize my savings and also earn cashback on my spendings.Would be great if the credit card can cover Simplygo and Paynow,btohqsg
PayNow and CC spend are 2 separate things. You need to give more info on your spending habits  unless you only spend on SimplyGo?,btohqsg
I usually spend around $600‚Äì$1000 per month. The amount fluctuates.Mainly simplygo  spotify subscription  shopee/lazada and paywave transactions on food.,btohqsg
For Uob one account with 100k saving  pair with credit card spending 500$ per month u will get higher interest  can read more for Uob one account,btohqsg
Yes around 20k.Was thinking either uob one or ocbc 360,btohqsg
Uob one better  OCBC 360 hard to hit criteria,btohqsg
20k then both bank accounts are not ideal choices already. You can always mix using UOB One card and HSBC EGA/SCB eSaver for bank account.,btohqsg
Is the max interest easy to hit?,btohqsg

Split the bill ... What other cards u have,btohqsg
Possibly to split cards? And what kind of service?,btohqsg
You have to ask the payment merchant if they allow.,btohqsg
Unlikely to be able to spilt the bill üòä,btohqsg
Hahaa can't see how this better than trust link or trust cashback cc.,btohqsg
Agreed.Currently using Trust Link for withdrawals and Trust Cashback for spendingsThat‚Äôs like the entire spectrum of things that one would basically need.,btohqsg

Hi  would like to ask for opinion on home loan. DBS is offering 5 yrs fixed rate at 2.5% vs UOB 2 yrs fixed rate 2.7% with free fire insurance for 3 years. I have a multiplier account with DBS   wonder if I should go with DBS and lock the rate for 5 yrs or go for a shorter term as interest rate is coming down.,btohqsg
How much loan amount qualified for 2.5%?,btohqsg
How much is your loan quantum,btohqsg
How does one open a basic citibank account online? Every button leads to citigold page...,btohqsg
Its 200k minimum for 2.5% locked in 5 years  i think its quite a decent package as it is still lower than CPF board rate,btohqsg
Icic. 2.5% with $200k  if its refinancing  I think will have to check if the bank cover your legal fee  cos the loan quantum is low. For now 2.5% looks good  at least for the next 6mth. But I think next 1 yr should have few more rate cuts. You have to weigh your risk for the 5 yrs lock. Maybe shorter term lock will be better  if the bank gives you choices. Just my personal opinion,btohqsg
in terms of overseas spending  Trust Link and Trust Cashback card has no difference right? only withdrawal at ATM will have difference,btohqsg
1 has cashback. 1 doesn't. Not the same bah. üòÅ,btohqsg
Hi. What's the best card to use for air tickets about 5k? Cannot split bill. Trust?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Both 0.7-0.8% total spread over fx spot,btohqsg
Anyone holding both the trust cash back and trust link card have tested it out? any FX spread difference?,btohqsg
Since both cards are visa  they will take the converted rate and sgd amount when the authorisation takes place. Trust simply receives the sgd amount equivalent from visa and process the transaction accordingly,btohqsg
same visa exchange rate  Trust cashback have 1%-15% cashback,btohqsg
So actually no strong reason to use the trust link card now that got the cash back card right?,btohqsg
Cashback ideally. I am not finding any card with such a high cap so I cannot be too picky  I guess? Flying Etihad.,btohqsg
trust link card for cash withdrawal overseas,btohqsg
