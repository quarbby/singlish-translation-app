Mine is the sale of balance,btohqsg
And they scheduled for mine to be 24May.So i believe so its not delayed because i didnt receive any email,btohqsg
if no maybe no delays. if got they sure email,btohqsg
can i ask which launch? November 2020? cause iâ€™m waiting for appt email too . for yishun,btohqsg
Yishun not yet. U can call and ask them but because of delay they may not be able to confirm the date,btohqsg
ahh isee. iâ€™m from november launch too,btohqsg
My friend is under yishun also havent received the email,btohqsg
isee! you just received the email today or?,btohqsg
They will email exactly 2 weeks before,btohqsg
Anyone knows whether there is a marsiling grove bto on tele?,btohqsg
ahhisee! thanks for the prompt reply babe! wish you good luck for your selection!,btohqsg
if can't find the BTO group chat  either it's in private mode or no one has created it yet,btohqsg
Hi friends  May I know if I get buy resale then after how many years we can apply for BTO  Like is it after 2-3 year or only after MOP ?,btohqsg
Yes  and only can after MOP then apply. Last time few years back  can apply for new flat as long the keys is only ready upon completion of existing flat 5 yr MOP. Now cannot liao.,btohqsg
Waiting for BTO open for May ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
maybe HDB might want to tarik... i duno,btohqsg
they too many back log liao,btohqsg
So those affected projects by covid 19   buyer got the option to change to re sale flat ?,btohqsg
Resales price shooting thru the roof. All owners greedy with hot demand.,btohqsg
So it's not a walk in the park either if cannot wait 6-7 yrs for BTO.,btohqsg
nope. it is still as good as giving up their current chance,btohqsg
still got 11 days to enter June..,btohqsg
guess which is the most sought after BTO of May,btohqsg
should be either macpherson or telok blangah,btohqsg
It probably be all  cause of the current situation,btohqsg
Im also waiting for sbf yishun nov 2020. For me Waiting is better than receiving delayed email i guess ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
yeah  the previous woodlands proj in aug 2020 was so oversubbed. well so was everything else  haha,btohqsg
thought mature estate projects are the most sought after upon every launch,btohqsg
May 2019 BTO was launched somewhere on 22-May-2019ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Mature estates vary by popularity too  depending on whether its central and close to mrt,btohqsg
The aug 2020 woodlands more oversubbed than bishan  tamp and pasir ris,btohqsg
OK maybe an exception for hougang BTO of Aug it is the best plot even though its non mature,btohqsg
That one is like fake non mature lol,btohqsg
but it might be good to many that it is non mature estate,btohqsg
Non mature means singles can apply for 2 room there is it?,btohqsg
omg kovan has the best plot lah,btohqsg
singles can apply 2r flexi at mature though,btohqsg
Wonder if the kovan bto will be similar price as the Bartley bto,btohqsg
I reckon it'd be pegged to non mature pricing,btohqsg
Nov 2020 tamp was around that price,btohqsg
i hope woodlands 4rm will start from 270k or somewhere there  haha,btohqsg
I also want to try woodland,btohqsg
isn't the best plot of Woodlands near MRT? last Aug BTO,btohqsg
speaking of convenience  so far BTO till August  best plot is kovan,btohqsg
most expensive plot should be queenstown though it faces AH and 15mins walk to the MRT,btohqsg
kovan  one stop to nex/circle/blue line. 2 or 3 mins walk to the mall/hawker/MRT  5 mins walk to the row of cafe opposite/to row of eateries,btohqsg
imo  better than bddr and macpherson,btohqsg
yes please. hahaha cuz this time round it is not beside the MRT  it is about a 10-15min walk to the MRT. So it's not like Urbanville which was like directly beside the MRT,btohqsg
Ya but idk if mature and non mature really play a part in pricing or its just purely based on location and amenities,btohqsg
Every 3 months. Feb  May  Aug  Nov,btohqsg
