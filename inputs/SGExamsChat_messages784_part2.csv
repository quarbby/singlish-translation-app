Splitting the ticket made Wilson the winner,btohqsg
RFK is an environmentalist but also anti vaccination,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs why I think he can steal votes from both,btohqsg
But also he appeals to those who hate Washington creatures or the chaos under trump,btohqsg
You can get a good sense based on that,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt really looked into it yet,btohqsg
But based on what u say most likely it would split the ticket for Rep,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt really clear at this point  since there are polls that suggest both scenarios. But one thing for sure is that the candidates from the 2 parties are desperately trying to paint RFK as more ideologically aligned to their opponents  in hopes that voters who are considering either of them and RFK won‚Äôt vote for RFK,btohqsg
Like trump keeps trying to paint RFK as some radical liberal lol,btohqsg
Yeah both know and are trying to offload the shift on the other part in an attempt to split the ticket. Even RFK himself is not sure,btohqsg
