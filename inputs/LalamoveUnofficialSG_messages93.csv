"Ppl aready dying still huan lo what economy.ü§£ There's a saying ""‰∫∫Âú®Â§©Â†ÇÈí±Âú®Èì∂Ë°å‚Äù",btohqsg
That true la. But dying percentage is still low. Anyway SG always like that nothing happen  no action taken.,btohqsg
Can see Sg Gov also shaking liao. When on TV their hair looks messy liao. Haha,btohqsg
No lah they purposely. Must look like they working. White hair aso dun dye liao. Must show stress lol. Every year earn few millions. Must act stressü§£,btohqsg
anyone notice that the order value is dropping ?,btohqsg
Sydney and Melbourne coming to 4 months full lockdown. Yesterday Sydney had 15 deaths.At the end of the day.. no system is 100% full-proof;Full lockdown  heightened Alert or open fully (Europe)..We have been living with this COVID for coming to 2 years and we are adults... i believe we can make our own decision regarding social distancing etc etc without having Govt come up with rules and regulations..Do what u think is right for your family and not when someone tell u to do it..,btohqsg
Got meh? Have to calculate the distance fare lor,btohqsg
It's something we have to live with,btohqsg
I don't think SG is ready to live with it leh  those ppl live as though Covid doesn't exists  which is more frightening.,btohqsg
I don't think it's abt living as though it doesn't exist. In the long run  pple have to still go out n work to make a living. Not everyone can wfh. We can only do our best to stay safe by wearing masks n cleaning hands etc. If when outside having meals in btw work also have to remove mask  if unlucky kena also not by choice. Eventually have to go back to normal day to day living outside.,btohqsg
Like for us delivery personnel  how can we stay hm? Just do whatever we can. This virus is not going to disappear,btohqsg
Its all about dining in. U dine in u need take off mask open mouth,btohqsg
In the long run  if ban dine in  restos also will buey tahan one. Even if let's say lockdown now  cases drop to zero  when reopen n dine in allowed again  who is to say cases won't go up again? When that happens  issit go back to same thing again. Its never ending cycle at this rate.,btohqsg
Close liao  economy jialat  pple buey tahan  also jialat,btohqsg
Any one got problem with app today,btohqsg
Cannot just look at fnb itself. Lots of linked sectors to fnb,btohqsg
Mine got no  pickup/upload pics/drop off option to click today,btohqsg
Big fnb employ alot of ft  the smaller ones don't. Then the smaller ones will likely close first cos they don't have the financial power. Also jialat cos alot r locals,btohqsg
The problem is ppl are not that disciplined and generally social animal  slowly spreading the virus all over the island when the healthcare doesn't have enough capacity and seeing daily death cases even for vaccinated seniors. The vulnerable one sacrifice for the economy good?,btohqsg
If they are vulnerable person.. then they shouldn't be out right..??When i say we are all adults means we have our own responsibility to decide how we need to social distance ourselves.. if restaurant too many ppl dun go if u are vulnerable.. ntuc packed  go shop midnight.. u have a choice.If u are vulnerable  get vaccinated stay at home.If u are risk taker.. then go out and have fun and accept whatever comes with the fun.The point is.. no system is full proof.. life has to move on.. it is just at what risk level each individual can live and accept..,btohqsg
some vulnerable person stay alone with no next to kin   they have difficulties in walking. when they went out to buy food  they rather eat outside first then go down and pack food home. they cant order food online cuz delivery fee to them is quite expensive or they dont know how to use the application.,btohqsg
a non vulnerable person also will get sick. death/virus dont choose people,btohqsg
The society/govt will have to find ways to reach out to then and help them.We cannot be a state of perpetual lockdown  or even a cyclical open and close. We need to ease back into normal life  gradually if need be.In wars  there would always be deaths and injuries  and have no doubt we are in a war  one not man made but given by nature.,btohqsg
Well if the pharma can't create a better vaccine or find a cure  this war likely never ends,btohqsg
As long as we have to wear mask  the war is ongoing,btohqsg
it not society/govt didnt find ways. some people dont like to burden others. if they can do by themself  they do.try to be in their shoes. not everyone is the sam not everyone is perfect.as long as wearing mask  trace together is still ongoing  there wont be easing back into normal life.if you say we need to ease back to normal life  do accept vulnerable person  out of their home cuz before covid vulnerable person also going everywhere.what is back to normal life/live with covid. it mean there wont be trace together and wearing mask. sick   see doctor   take medication   eat medicine.,btohqsg
Then it's up to them to make a choice  like someone just say above. Base on ur own situation  choose the option best suited for urself.You are going to get cases every year going forward  like with dengue and flu. The fatalities and injuries will likely happen when we open up  regardless of when  as infections increase. But when it sweeps through  the population 's body get used  the fatalities and injuries numbers come down  so is just something we have to get used to.And not see the numbers abit high and ask why govt nv go into lockdown modeMasks wearing and tray returns are good habits that this pandemic has put into us  so should be seem as a normal thing.As human  we want to evolve  keep the good from things we experienced and move on.Age  sickness and death is a cycle of life  and EVERYONE will go thru it,btohqsg
"have you been in their situation? we cant just pin point our fingers to them. one day u will grow old. one day u might be like them then younger generation will start to pin point to you saying u are vulnerable. stay home.do u know gov is slapping their own face? Case increase no lock down. but when hospital facilty is full   oh go heightening. then tell people they doing this is to improve their healthcare facility. this is totally bullshit. if u wan us to live with it. open up border. open up everything. dont control crowds. dont do only ""2 person dine in""so why i dont see even after SARs period. people wearing mask?so ya move on. everyone will go. so accept everything including vulnerable person outside. they are humans after all",btohqsg
"It's easy to say ""life moves on"" if you got no loved ones die from covid.  Last time I aso hack care yaya papaya till my 60 yo relative pass away last month due to covid.",btohqsg
most important is stay happy can liao. you dunno next min u kena covid not,btohqsg
"Gahmen is sacrificing the ""old ones "" now for greater prosperity of the rich elites",btohqsg
because old people say no go no come. so one must go another will come,btohqsg
my fam fell scam to a jnt cod delivery.,btohqsg
And we managed to get the money back.,btohqsg
You already rightly said not everyone is in the same situation.For 10% of vulnerable the 90% have to suffer some sort of restriction..??If no one to buy food.. go at 11am b4 lunch crowd.Fyi..every year the normal flu kills more than covid.. why are is covid different..?? Because covid is more transmissible compared to the normal flu...,btohqsg
Sacrficing for the rich elite...??I think the normal ppl like me also not much savings left.. üòÇüòÇüòÇAlot of Restaurants  tourist related businesses and event companies etc etc etc also cannot tahan anymore le..,btohqsg
then u be the good guy lor. find those vulnerable people. buy food for them. u telling people virus appear when there is full crowd? when theres no crowd there wont be virus?  is the same thing like 1m apart. virus still within 1m range. who says virus stay within 1m only?,btohqsg
If they can go out and buy lunch for themselves whether lockdown or no lockdown.. since they dunno how to use app.. why must ppl buy for them..??Whether go out at 11am or peak period is also them going out right??I dun get it.,btohqsg
I sry for the death of ur relative  I have no similar experience with my closed one  I had a bad bike accident in my 20s and was in coma for a few days  and could easily passed on then.What I saying is  even if I were to die then  i would want my family to move on with their life and not kp to govt to ban motorcycle or transport just because i die in a bike accident.,btohqsg
"Gahmen is subsidising them with millions pump in every month. ""Too big to fail "" like SIAü§£ü§£. My fren own a restaurant n he's still surviving thanks to Zheng hu",btohqsg
so virus appear   during peak period??????,btohqsg
Then if we shut down.. how does the old ppl buy food then..??,btohqsg
i never even say shut down. even lock down people still can go down and buy food what. dont tell me lock down u 2 mths 24/7 at home meh,btohqsg
My place kopitiam everyday still long q üëç,btohqsg
ya lor. lock down doesnt mean cnt go down and buy food,btohqsg
Infact their business now even better since alot wfh need dabao from neighborhood.,btohqsg
Hence.. there is still a chance of infection as u said.. coz virus dun appear peak period only ma..So.. whether it is 2 dine in  5 dine in  no dine in or fully open also the vulnerable will be at risk.. correct..??,btohqsg
so might as well open up everything. dont need go 2 dine in or 5 dine in.,btohqsg
ya. they huat like no tmr,btohqsg
The chup chye PNG damn huat. I never their queue so long pre covid,btohqsg
cuz ppl wfh. cfm go down their neighbourhood kopitiam buy food.,btohqsg
Yes.. they are going fwd eventually with that..But because of the vulnerable.. we are still not yet.. gahmen trying to push up the vaccination to higher level 1st to protect the vulnerable..There is a facebook posting by Ho Ching regarding this..,btohqsg
Mai la. Now dine in 5 Nia u see covid cases everywhere. My majong Kaki n his family  aso kena now.,btohqsg
I duno abt you guys . Ppl around me quite a few Kena cobid liao recently,btohqsg
I got old n young at home . So I must protect myself to protect them,btohqsg
Posting on by Ho Ching on why they are flipflopping on the restrictions,btohqsg
dont blame vulnerable. they are also humans. gov wan 5k case. so we see lor,btohqsg
Got 5k then they will say be prepared for 10k. Lol. Make it 5 million Sua . One short settle. ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Once one pap kena they cfm do something.,btohqsg
Just one week ago they say prepare for 1 to 2k . Up their quota very fast like up coe,btohqsg
Actually.. who is blaming the vulnerable..?? It is for the reason to protect the vulnerable that gahmen went back to 2 dine in..And the 5k cases are everybody of all ages.. as u mentioned goes to strengthen ur argument that the virus will attack anybody.. not only the vulnerable..,btohqsg
I had never seen F&B business so good last Sunday from non-peak period like 2 to 5pm still more than 50% people dining in. Saying living with it is giving ppl a wrong signal that it is okay to get infected becos you are vaccinated  just stay home to recover. It should be a highly preventive approach  not a reactive approach.,btohqsg
True lor. Like my majong Kaki. Boh kiasi. Everyday eat outside still bring small kids run here run there. Now whole family Dio.,btohqsg
Just for the sake of discussion.. how would u advocate for a highly preventive approach??Full lockdown..?? What would be ur opinion..??,btohqsg
The thing is gov is just not doing it right. Either close or open fully. Open close open close is a horrible thing to do. I for one advocate just open up. When I say living with the endemic doesn't mean don't need bother  just because vaccinated. I already said vaccinated doesn't mean u wouldnt get the virus. Living with it means just doing what you can to be safe. And whatever u can for ur family to be safe. I still have to go out work  does that mean I encourage pple go out? Just open up  cases will be there one way or another. Do what you can to protect urself,btohqsg
When you said  vulnerable person shouldn't go out. It shows you blaming them to be out in this kind of situatioGoing back to 2 dine in doesn't even helps.Ya so how would a vulnerable person affect the situation when virus is not choosy at all. Even a healthy person will get the virus.When you want live with it. Live with it totally. Don't halfway suka suka close. Suka suka do restrictions,btohqsg
Not everyone has the option to wfh I say again. So if lockdown  then does working in retail etc how? Who gg to feed them? Pple say then sacrifice those old pple who unfortunately pass on due to the virus  then who gg to help those who suffer from the financial difficulties? If want to compare everything  forever cannot compare finish,btohqsg
If I remember correctly China did it. They have a timing for retail to open and closing and for customer to buy things.,btohqsg
Well  kudos to China then. But can every country do it like them?,btohqsg
Cost of living in China n sg is it the same?,btohqsg
Like some old people say. They can why can't you. Is depend you want to do or don't want do. Is see which one stands in your heart more,btohqsg
You want control the situation faster or let it run wildly?,btohqsg
Well  there's 2 camps of thought,btohqsg
So let's say  if close n case drop,btohqsg
When open n up again how? Same thing again?,btohqsg
That time we close n case drop every1 happy. Open again case up,btohqsg
How long u want do this see saw thing,btohqsg
Y talk this issue here. Here is lalamove delivery,btohqsg
Chinese ppl especiall those from rural area like to cook. Even work aso can go bk home eat. And meituan very popular theteü§£,btohqsg
If u want air go other place,btohqsg
Now is different. Case still ongoing and is still open. When things get worse  facilty not enough space. Then do restrictions,btohqsg
You go see who start first. Don't come and say who start first. Get the facts right before pin pointing people,btohqsg
Firstly SG got no own resources. Not like China or nearer Malaysia,btohqsg
So any of my words say lockdown????????,btohqsg
Well  I only voice my opinion after others added theirs  same as u I guess,btohqsg
Ok.. wrong choice of words then.. vulnerable should choose when they go out or stay at home..,btohqsg
Yeah. We only voice out but someone wanted pin point me stating I started it,btohqsg
Ok wrong choice of words again..How would u advocate for a highly preventive approach...??The floor is yours...,btohqsg
I just take offence to the sentence see which one stands nearer to your heart,btohqsg
We cant control them actually. .,btohqsg
There is no one way for highly preventive approacg,btohqsg
i suggest   accept it   all go get inflected   weak will go   strong live one till become weak,btohqsg
Oh well. If I offended you. Just because of the sentence I can't help much. This is reality. One only care for themself before taking care of others,btohqsg
There's only 2 way. Follow your heart or follow your brain. I prefer follow my heartü§£,btohqsg
I have old pple at hm who I value as much. I do my precautionary measures n I go work. Work for income for family. Does that mean I care for myself only,btohqsg
Gahmen follow brain definitely cos they wan moneyyyyyüòú,btohqsg
Should swap the policy  now the unvaccinated one should have lesser restriction and be allowed to dine in at restaurants  while the vaccinated one can only dine in at coffeeshop. To minimise the spreading as vaccinated dose not show symptom easily.,btohqsg
If u think that way  then likewise I can't help much,btohqsg
Take turns for the unvax and vax people for equalities.,btohqsg

The person who got scammed didn't calculate the job payout? $152.70 cash on delivery + $100 tip  total = $252.70  but the recipient asked you to transfer $350  you lose out $350 - $252.70 = $97.3. The recipient only the cash order stated and $100 tips  still a losing business even if it is not a scammer.,btohqsg

Need to complete stage by stage.. After u complete the first order.. The next mission is to accomplished and so onüòÇ,btohqsg
I see  2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10 orders ($3 + $3 + $9 + $12) = $27,btohqsg
$27 / 10 jobs = $2.70 extra bonus on average for each job.$15 / 7 jobs = $2.14 extra bonus$6 / 4 jobs =  $1.50 extra bonusHmm  maybe I forgo the job to get activation bonus next time.,btohqsg
Any driver is free now and can pick up order,btohqsg
Cash out before Sunday 2359. Get on coming Wednesday. All other banks other than DBS and POSB will be later.,btohqsg

Realised the $4 was a tip in the original order. CS says will check on it. But till now no reply yet. Anyone can enlighten.  Thks,btohqsg

I saw someone here say they might sound if go out of route or something but alright then thanks,btohqsg
I rarely take food orders like Ooddle or GF because it seems like the customers and the shops are either impatient or take their own sweet time.,btohqsg
Same. Food always got such issues and also things like spillage etc. Better to just take other orders,btohqsg
Unless it's they order Lalamove directly. They are better because they have huge food order and requires car instead. They are usually nice. I think it's because it's a huge order  messing it up means all efforts wasted and more money lost. üòÑ,btohqsg
Dun do oddle practically can give up LLM le,btohqsg
There was once I took a 4 multiple stop order at Turf city. They prepare in advance so I can pick up right away. They even offer me a free ice milk tea. So nice. üòç,btohqsg

I kena one customer suspected it was illegal stuffs,btohqsg
clarify and show to u the items for safety purpose,btohqsg
Until make me feel like drugs,btohqsg
Yes kena before. Suspected  cos wanna meet at roadside. Small light box  send to condo. Condo occupant didnt want me to go up  met me in basement carpark. But then again  we're just delivery people and there's a docket to prove it,btohqsg
Can we informed the authority before we dropped off any suspicious items ?,btohqsg
Then if you drop off to the police and it's a false alarm how?,btohqsg
If suspicious don't take. Cos many hours will be wasted.,btohqsg
Wah  threaten riders and drivers ah. No wonder no one takes your job. üòÇ,btohqsg

Did 2 oddle delivery today. Both around $20 each. Both suppose to collect at 1pmCollected one at 1pm. The other at 1:15pm.One was send at 1:45pm while the other was at 2:05pmWill I be ban ?,btohqsg
U won't get ban  but love letter. If first job u collected at 1pm but delivered at 2.05pm  very high chance.,btohqsg
Really because of the stupid lift,btohqsg
Only 1 lift and there was like 3 differnt family queuing,btohqsg
Who is dumb enough to take this job? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Firstly if both supposed to collect at 1pm  if u collect at 1.15 is considered late liao. Advance jobs u only have 10mins grace. 2ndly if both is 1pm pickup  u supposed to deliver latest by 2pm. 2.05pm is aso considered late. So there is possibility u will get a late warning from llm,btohqsg
Have to put lalabag on top of car to win lucky draw,btohqsg
I also dw to get leh. Mandatory leh üòí,btohqsg
put at e top for show  this is waste of money,btohqsg
actually i think they should b providing this instead  cuz we helping them  plus we already given them deposit,btohqsg
I think sticker still optional.. coz own car not all want to put.  Rental car maybe..,btohqsg
They have a right to ask u to deliver hot/cold stuff in an insulated bag  but no right to say it must be a Lalamove branded 1,btohqsg
If they insist  I'm not doing LLM.,btohqsg
Knn  take 75 now still wanna take 19.90,btohqsg
Problematic app  slow customer service  hard so hard earn at most $100+ a day  get pestered to add their stickers. Now we must buy the bag.,btohqsg
If they deactivate u for not using their bags  u can go to court and sue for loss of earnings. In US  a group of deactivated delivery men can band together to file a class action suit. In spore it's harder as we normally act individually,btohqsg
Did Any1 collect popeye chai chee folded box to amk popeye?,btohqsg

Only take order with item description,btohqsg
Most did not put item description.,btohqsg
I think above pagiflorist is not the first time they do this to drivers. The worst is  their attitude was wrong if driver do not accept it they will scold u with vulgarity. I have to like every know this should not be doing a business like that .,btohqsg
And I not in the wrong and I saw that block me . Hope LLM with check with them but I doubt .,btohqsg

I need to use trolley  confirm MPV order type. Plus took up entire boot at the back,btohqsg
I told them they should book car not motorcycles and they told me if I drive car can take and scold me in vulgarity cos I said want to contact llm to cancel,btohqsg
U can tell them to cancel if u cannot take . For my case I tell them and they scold me in vulgarity and chase me away . Really holigan act . And worst said we Singaporean all like that,btohqsg
I contact live chat and llm said will cancel . And I check the app is cancel by driver ?,btohqsg
This above lady super rude scold loins at me and said if I do not go off she will call police . üò°,btohqsg
I told her I just want to contact llm to solve the problem.,btohqsg
I wish we can feedback to LLM and they can ban these goons,btohqsg
Llm would ban them la . Customer also right,btohqsg
We only can help each other here to boycott this shop . Pagiflorist 625 Aljunied Road,btohqsg
They came here to earn money no problem but they bully Singaporean is not ok,btohqsg

For car ok cos 4 item flower need car . And the slightly plump guy is the guy scold me vulgarity as I told him that 3 item exceed the limit and he told me I can take cos I drive car and told me if the drive car should not take motorcycles job .,btohqsg
When something happen then you will know how bad is the guy and the lady attitude towards u . Really holigan act,btohqsg
so far i do delivery jobs. i never encountered issues with sender or recipient.not only for lalamove. grabexpress also.,btohqsg
Ok  remember: Pagiflorist 625 Aljunied RoadDon't take. üòÇ,btohqsg
not really lucky.got once or twice. sender or recipient MIA.then have to return back items,btohqsg
when doing lalamove  especially if u using car  if bid for motor jobs  dun expect sender to not take advantage especially during this period.,btohqsg
for me  i only bid if i really want the job. if not  i wait for better job or locations i wanna go to.,btohqsg
I understand if he apologise that he do not know it exceed the limit for motorcycles I ok but instill he blame me and scold me vulgarity said I Singaporean all like that . Which I think is not right .,btohqsg
ya. if he scold and shout vulgarities  then not right. better u report to lalamove.,btohqsg
