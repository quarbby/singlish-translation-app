Low mileage can also be tampered with.,btohqsg
spore only crazy people will do that,btohqsg
I inspect 1 car the mileage was 70k+. But last battery registration was 220k. It’s a direct seller.,btohqsg
Hi  for ntuc orange force  I understand that they'll help you settle everything in the event of accident. How about nom accidental events like battery dead  flat tyre etc.? Do they also help? Thanks,btohqsg
Flat tyre call tow or mobile tyre,btohqsg
A different 2024 list: Toyota and BYD emerge on topWith parallel imports factored in  Toyota was still 2024's leader for new car registrations  even as BYD took the crown decisively among authorised dealers.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Here's who topped the chart ✨,btohqsg
I see. So  I need to find my own separate provider for non accident roadside assistance. After that  I can submit the claim to ntuc?,btohqsg
Depend on your package if there is any  free tow service,btohqsg
Read your insurance coverage and check with your insurance agent for procedures,btohqsg
Normal road side no need tow also ok,btohqsg
Like one year a limited time.,btohqsg
No all wrong. Prevention better than cure. Install tpms that can also read battery volts,btohqsg
Just called ntuc. Their roadside assistance and wellness cover  allows u to submit expenses incurred due to non accident event  up to 200 per year. Need to ownself find separate provider for the flat tyre  flat battery  towing service etc.,btohqsg
E.g. >2 owners >3 yrs old yet yearly mileage not even 10k is a big red flag,btohqsg
Depends on what is wrong.. if I not wrong  service change is 50 or 80,btohqsg
How much premium u want to pay,btohqsg
Usually your insurance have these options if you opt in  otherwise is AA,btohqsg
Civic their gearbox prone to issues,btohqsg
Come @kk any unfortunate encounters to these?,btohqsg
Kk a lot of encounters to share here 🤭🤭,btohqsg
He need to ask chatgpt first,btohqsg
Usually you can also tompang your family member or friend with AA membership to help you call if required  else you pay at least $50 more,btohqsg
This 1 is comprehensive insurance then have,btohqsg
Haha nothing to claim one. But if e.g. you buang wall and you claim your own insurance  your ncd affected  so dun anyhow claim 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Call emas but they tow to safe location only,btohqsg
Yah that's their gam force 😂  gam=> orange,btohqsg
They said the expenses incurred e.g. change tyre  battery etc.  can be reimbursed up to 200 per year. This one will also affect my ncd?,btohqsg
No la..gam force is only for accident,btohqsg
Usually no but best is read carefully if it will affect. If they say is reimburse then usually no.,btohqsg
"Lol sorry missed the ""non accident""",btohqsg
Usually roadside assistance in insurance only cover accident,btohqsg
No problem...now I need to find non accident service provider  just in case...,btohqsg
Anyways guys I plan to go to jb.Any good workshop for Volkswagen?,btohqsg
No. just buy third party insurance n tpms. The savings can tow 10 times+ n still have change for many Big Mac meals,btohqsg
yup  they are like a supplement to your car insurance. But in my experience with new car and old especially coe cars  AA is best if you buy coe cars lol cos higher chances of breakdown,btohqsg
@cy go read up (sgcarmart articles  not some chatgpt s) on differences between comprehensive  or is it standard and 3rd party insurance to understand what suits your car and your needs.,btohqsg
I’m using Deepseek. It’s more powerful than chatgpt,btohqsg
So far it can diagnose with 100% accuracy when I describe my car symptoms in detail,btohqsg
But both still way better than unreliable mechanics. Mostly they r lowly educated n hv low iq if not they won’t be mechanics also. They r only good at guessing n can’t give definitive answers. Some even compare themselves with doctors n say that doctors can be wrong also.,btohqsg
Knowing mechanics r not bright n they don’t hv the required tools  I will diagnose the problem by myself. I Buy my own specialised tools n get all the related info n procedures. Then I will find the cheapest n most obedient mechanic n instruct him to repair step by step. I want them to do it my way not their way.,btohqsg
Is there any article I can read up on how to use AI to diagnose car.,btohqsg
How did you get the deepseek model to work with this,btohqsg
Deepseek is different model. V good too.,btohqsg
Until you ask it about Tiananmen Square and Taiwan.,btohqsg
Yeah. I read about it. But you need some interface to send the prompts to it right. Chatgpt uses gpt model only right?,btohqsg
That's just click and bait news. The model itself doesn't sensor any results. It's the wrapper around it that sensors.,btohqsg
There are many other videos that shows deepseek model returning results about tiannanmen square.,btohqsg
