I did  It just doesn't work.,btohqsg
Happy for you. Interested to know if you read examples as well or just focus on reading the notes only,btohqsg
I have always emphasised doing instead of reading because that was how I aced my exams. It has helped in many of my exams in uni.But it doesn't work for me in the area of language and arts except for German.,btohqsg

I rather retake h2 Geog paper then doing Emath,btohqsg
I recovering from my 14h work marathon yesterday while my students taking the practical ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I recovered from all my h2 promos side by side last week and h1 geepee,btohqsg
my goal is for all my students to score A. So work super hard for them lor. No choice one.I expect equally hard work from them.,btohqsg
it's A level  you have to work real hard before the exams,btohqsg
A lvl dont have last min mugging,btohqsg
because the rest before exams is just as important and you won't want to be in a panic mode,btohqsg
Uw die then u do it,btohqsg
at 10pm+ last night  my brain almost stop functioning properly when I look at their questions. Can't process it properly.Overworked.It's something that can happen to students if they study and prepare up to the last min before exams. So never do that.,btohqsg
objective of the sharing is  must rest before exams.I've seen so many study till last minute. Doesn't work that way.,btohqsg
i thought the thing on the left is the candy,btohqsg

I set a lower standard already using 80%,btohqsg
but before my stronger subjects... i wld be grinding the other subjects actually ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg

I memorise tge colors of reagents,btohqsg
I train my students for physics practical planning  do in 15 mins,btohqsg

i train myself to do phys planning by giving up all 8 marks,btohqsg
I am thinking I should do bio now,btohqsg
u want see my prelims papee,btohqsg
because u don't know my method,btohqsg
also phys prac legit easy de,btohqsg
38 for ny and 46 for ej,btohqsg
They say a level prac harder,btohqsg
Physics is similar. Always copy from A level practical,btohqsg
Cos school prelim always titration and enthalpy change and qa,btohqsg
JPJC practical this year same as 2018 A level paper,btohqsg
but a level they may do gravimetry and organic planning,btohqsg
VJ practical same as 2021 practical,btohqsg
Gravimetry isÂ the measurement of the strength of a gravitational field.,btohqsg
I have no chemistry with chemistry,btohqsg
I meant the planning part scares,btohqsg
All the schools give different stuff,btohqsg

I got stumped by alot of stuff,btohqsg
Uhh A levels was 2015 for me,btohqsg
Now I look back feel abit dumb,btohqsg
cos all looks manageable and I was asking my friends simple stuff,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t study as hard as I should for A levels,btohqsg
2020 I took then they ask purification of nitrobenzene,btohqsg
I was lucky to have over studied for A level Physics,btohqsg
this is a normal strat for prac,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t study a ton partly cos I knew my Uni course cut off not very high,btohqsg
15 mins more for u to chat,btohqsg
I looked up transition metal prac,btohqsg
only thing there is calibration lime,btohqsg
it came out on oscillations  idk how to say rubber band tension thing and electricity,btohqsg
usually do very well first to come ask,btohqsg
not bad but i canâ€™t rly judge the difficulty,btohqsg
luckily i could finish collecting the data in time before the changeover lol,btohqsg
you have seen all the qns before right,btohqsg

A level Physics has more graph questions for theory paper,btohqsg
i had 3 graphs to draw jus saying,btohqsg
actually +1 because iâ€™m expected to plot 2 graphs for q3 ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Personally I didn't do any tys when I was A level. Because I was the over confident sort,btohqsg
graph easy to score no meh,btohqsg
but it's not the recommended thing to do,btohqsg
where like 1 mark for accuracy,btohqsg
I see so A levels stuff are tedious,btohqsg
and time seems to be impt,btohqsg
well that means 4 tables also :],btohqsg
The seab and cambrigde try to get as many weaknesses and hard qns,btohqsg
Memorising planning seems a bit tedious ngl,btohqsg
I am thinking of writing out,btohqsg
I did a bunch of papers now I have to memorise alot of corrections,btohqsg
General comments so far is not bad,btohqsg
I hope 68 can be A,btohqsg
Honestly I hope I get no silly mistakes,btohqsg
like if I lose like 3 marks out of 10 marks,btohqsg
