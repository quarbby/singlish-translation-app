but the height and shape different mah,btohqsg
got the EV version of vezel..,btohqsg
A Nissan qashqai should be a much better alternative at a slightly higher price at 12.5k depre. Definitely more reliable  similar cargo space.,btohqsg
The new vezel also nice leh,btohqsg
That time drove it from getgo,btohqsg
Qashqai is nice for a moving brick,btohqsg
Honda Fit interior is not as small as you think,btohqsg
I still like the old look like transformers,btohqsg

Qashqai the 1.2 engine like have alot of complaint  dunno about the new model but the older one like many people keep saying to get the 2.0 variant instead of the 1.2,btohqsg
I am sorry but I dun get what you mean,btohqsg
how do you feel a bigger car is smaller because the chassis is small?,btohqsg
Don't think Vezel interior feel small at all.,btohqsg
Okok. I rest my case. I delete my comment,btohqsg
Chassis is chassis.Car body and interior spaciousness is different from the chassis size.,btohqsg
The new vezel body is massive but interior is small for what you expect,btohqsg
I feel that way also  when sitting at honday city it feel bigger than vezel dunno why,btohqsg
But what do I know  I avoid buying honda like the plague,btohqsg
I sat in both new Vezel and old Vezel.they are designed differently.You can see that old Vezel is maximise interior space.new Vezel is designed to be cozy and more inclined towards comfort as compared to old model.,btohqsg
you are talking about car body size and interior spaciousness.so why has it got to do with chassis?,btohqsg
I never say anything about chasiss did I?,btohqsg
what i saw was Vezel same chassis as Fit.so Vezel feels small.and you said it's relative.,btohqsg
so suddenly chassis is not in question,btohqsg
FFS stop putting words in my mouth. All I'm saying is interior space relative to body size,btohqsg
Hi gurus  so in short for PARF a more affordable + reliable SUV  .. would be vezel/hrv only?A newbie trying to get SUV here üò´  tried getgo for older vezels  have feedbacks from wife and sis that the back indeed stiff  quite bad when going thru humps and bumps,btohqsg
huh that's me. i said share shame chassis. LOL dont fight.,btohqsg
anyway just saying we can't determine exterior size to say interior is spacious or small. not trying to fight with anyone.many people sit in Jazz and Fit and realised how spacious it is for a small hatchback.corolla hatchback is bigger  try sitting in 1 and will realise the rear leg space is really really bad.so it really boils down to how they design the interior.,btohqsg
Open vtec and noone will argue,btohqsg
Civic more ex than vezel and jazz üòÇ,btohqsg
Nowadays PARF car also like 14-16k depre already 19k for new car is like expected üòû,btohqsg
How about Citroen? Avoid at all cost?,btohqsg
Ah yes ... paiseh I wasn't clear.. I was meaning to ask what other options haha,btohqsg
Bruh.. this is used civic 1.5 turbo,btohqsg
Can I also ask a noob question sorry.. why are most parf hybrids having arf at 5k only?,btohqsg
So sad the subsidy for the hybrid next year less 10k üò≠,btohqsg
