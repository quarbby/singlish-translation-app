"Yup. They have no motivation in life.""The Lost Decade""New Supra just buy over BMW engine.üòÖShould put in their 3.5L V6 and twin turbo it to fight nissan r35üòÇüëçNew lotus using Toyota 3.5L V6 and super charge itüòÖ",btohqsg

LFA super nice! Just that it's very limited,btohqsg
Sadly one of them had fallen off a truck as well. It was the highest mile LFA in the world and a trucking company dropped it. Many lots because of sad reasons. But the LFA is a legendary car,btohqsg
I get it purists argue the supra is no longer a toyota. yes there are parts from other makers  but hasn't that been the case for many other cars as well? like mercedes or jaguar engines in Aston Martins  or toyota sourced engines in Lotus.  that does not make a Lotus a Toyota...,btohqsg
the best sounding car in  the world,btohqsg
Just because they sold only 500 because they limited them means it's a failed project?,btohqsg
it is a failed project because it is not successful,btohqsg
What would you define as successful for a car of that stature?,btohqsg
I wouldn't call it a failed project.  It was intended to be rare and bespoke sir.,btohqsg
But it's their most successful sport/race model. GT race.Just like GTR.Can you imagine they use other maker engine.üòÖ,btohqsg
Even the carerra GTs which the LFA is often compared to based on the engine sound had only 1270 units made,btohqsg
