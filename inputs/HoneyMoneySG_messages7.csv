tbh  I got into CDC because of the visa card. If CDC no longer attractive I might look into some where else,btohqsg
Going to redo my research about exchange and staking platform again.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows if I am eligible for Singsaver sign up gift if I link my Citi Cashback card to Amaze and make an oversea retail transaction of S$500?,btohqsg
I'm going to take a while to research. Still busy with other things in life,btohqsg
Crypto got everyone signed up happily staked and now reduced all the perks,btohqsg
the lesson learned: be careful with 'promotion periods'  they didn't promise you it would last forever 🤪,btohqsg
Anyone manage to get cash back by topping up Revolut with SC unlimited cash back cc??,btohqsg
I’m just wondering how long Revolut’s MRT cashback will last🤣,btohqsg
just realised i have never used my CPM card for prioritypass. can anyone confirm that if i have dbs altitude and CPM card  i need separate prioritypass logins?,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to know if anyone able to successfully use revoult virtual card with gojek?,btohqsg
at least revolut tells you the end date of their promotion. and anything beyond that is a nice bonus. CDC abruptly nerfed their rates and gave us no time to do anything.,btohqsg
Hi  may i know if the UOB absolute cashback card still giving cashback for grab topups?,btohqsg
Guys  anybody know this is the right account to transfer usd to FTX pro?,btohqsg
Can watch kelvin learn investing video. I think he got a updated episode on this,btohqsg
Hello! Anybody knows if previously is a supplementary card holder  whether now apply for credit card qualifies for the welcome gifts?,btohqsg
Hi  for cardup to pay for monthly insurance  can I confirm if I use UOB one credit card to pay  it will also consider eligible spend for my monthly 500/1000/2000tier spend?,btohqsg
but the cash back still a bit...,btohqsg
I have been thinking about this. if you use AMEX to top up grab wallet and use AXS to pay for insurance. you actually earn 1.5-1.7%. which is about the same as cardup and UOB One combo,btohqsg
Yeap I am thinking the same. Because I also have a UOB one bank account  to eligible for level 1  I need a monthly 500 spend (can be combined) on selective UOB credit/debit card.,btohqsg
So I would want to have my UOB fully utilise before I go for firm 1.5% cashback for my AMEX,btohqsg
"Like I mention over here  you need to hit just nice $500 or $1000. if not you are ""short changing"" yourself. The only benefit is the additional cashback like shopee  grab and etc.",btohqsg
Yeap I am calculating the 500 well spend on UOB One credit card.,btohqsg
Nice  if worse come to worse can buy FairPrice gift card.,btohqsg
Also wanted to share this  I top up revolut  then transfer out. I get this.,btohqsg
Yes  I learn all this good tips  from you all.How good it is if UOB one do have the extra cashback for FairPrice. Hardly go daily farm.,btohqsg
from where to where? I transfer from grab to revolut to CDC $4500 since Feb 2022. Excluding the AMEX TCB first $5000 from grab to revolut then back to bank,btohqsg
But I did bank deposit at least $100 every month and use it to take public transport and get 20% cashback.,btohqsg
My flow is  Amex > grabpay > revolut > bank.,btohqsg
A lot of us got revolut because we using it to top up CDC  using it for public transport or at least use it for oversea spending.Grab > revolut > bank is too obvious already.,btohqsg
Ok  Yeap I tested it small amount,btohqsg
Now I know I should avoid that,btohqsg
Another cardup service I saw it rental payment. Will find out more about it..,btohqsg
Avoid  after top up Revolut > bank. Initial thinking  get 1.5% off by paying my monthly rental using this method. The 1.5% is source from Amex TCB,btohqsg
Oh can actually just use Amex > gpmc then can stack the reward,btohqsg
I assume you are getting 1.5% by paying for monthly rental to your landlord bank account.,btohqsg
So now if we spend 500 1000 2000 all will be at 3.33% only?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGso for UOB  the spend category is not important ald? I.e. 500 1000 2000?,btohqsg
Seriously  I dun understand why they changed and still call it tier 1 2 3,btohqsg
Gosh now not many attractive credit cards in the market anymore,btohqsg
Very trouble to track the uob,btohqsg
Use Amex 1.7% with gpmc almost similar,btohqsg
yup  just use AMEX with gpmc  unless you can hit 30k a month on gpmc or you have specific high spending like shopee or grab for UOB One where you'll get additional 5%. That additional cashback is a separate cap at $100 a month,btohqsg
I guess cardup is the way to go for you.,btohqsg
Guys how to claim for the ipad after hitting the 500$ spend limit ?,btohqsg
Citi was running a promotion this month,btohqsg
Hi guys  what's the best way to withdraw usdc out from hodl now.,btohqsg
Which card have highest welcome gift?,btohqsg
Thank you. I heard before somesay go via ftx blokfolio and withdraw usdc to USD 1:1 into dbs multiplier,btohqsg
Does that still work now ? I vaguely recall smt changed .,btohqsg
Thank you  how long will the wait be like ?,btohqsg
depends on which promotion you sign up for lor.,btohqsg
For $500 spend  what is considered as eligible spend?,btohqsg
Applied this in April  and start using it 1 May.Top up revolut using OCBC debit to revolut 100SGD.Every time tap for MRT or public bus  however only got 2 transaction and each is just 0.10sgd.Is it because of long holiday since 1 May?,btohqsg
As of now  physical card will only arrive 13 May  so I haven’t activate the card. I added that to Apple Pay. Am I doing it right?,btohqsg
It's ok to use virtual cards before getting the physical one. Should be all good,btohqsg
As for the cashback  you should be charged as usual (so $0.10 is weird to me)  and the next month you will be paid back,btohqsg
$0.10 seems to be merely card validation  not the real fare,btohqsg
Ok  I wanted to get the virtual card clear ya. We are talking about the physical card added to Apple Pay as virtual card. Not the Revolut own virtual card as screenshot below? Correct ya?,btohqsg
wait a second  if you haven't got the physical card  how could you add it to ApplePay?,btohqsg
In fact it can. Haven’t leh~,btohqsg
i think it’s cos you topped up with debit card. for the 20% cashback you need to do bank transfer top up of 100 bucks,btohqsg
not sure mate  i just remember the bank top up part from chris’ videos,btohqsg
In fact event my card and my partner’s card haven’t arrive and activate  because I do refer invite my partner  I get my 60SGD referral rewards by just 3 x 10sgd transactions via Apple Pay at NTUC.,btohqsg
- $0.10 is a MasterCard consolidated posting thing when after few days or a certain dollar amount. VISA is consolidated per day- Digital card can be added to Apple/Google Pay before physical card even arrives.- Do make 3x $10 with your digital card for referrer to get rewards,btohqsg
And yes  do bank transfer before end of month to be eligible for 20% cashback,btohqsg
Ok thanks@ChrisHMSG  now understand is needed bank account direct add money into Revolut not via any bank card method.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  does it make a different if I top up beginning of the month? Thanks,btohqsg
Dont do too early on 1st day. Time difference may make it rollback to previous month,btohqsg
I just to ensure  I do bank transfer of 100 again just now to ensure not conflicting with my previous bank card top up.,btohqsg
Hi all  I tried to use the revolut to pay for a transaction in tokopedia Indonesia  but the tokopedia apps rejected. Not sure why. Is there any setting to enable overseas transaction in revolut?,btohqsg

Thanks! So I just link it in sg and use amaze card directly overseas like in sg right,btohqsg
Mine was all retail spend contactless + online grocery (fp/redmart ),btohqsg

Hi all  the best way to pay for insurance premiums is to top up grab card using Amex/uob then pay using grab card right?,btohqsg
You get grab points for paying insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Amex give rebates if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Yeap as per my understanding is first 5k get 3%,btohqsg
U get cash rebate from Amex. No points earn from grab for paying insurance via AXS,btohqsg
Welcome. Cashback from only Amex True Cashback card or UOB Amex Absolute card.,btohqsg
Hi Chris and everyone  looks like my best cashback pairing combo is coming to an end  at least till end 2022 as I’m reaching the annual spending limit of my Grab Mastercard-Amex/UOB Absolute combo.Is there anyone in the same situation and is the next best pairing the Citibank cashback (1.5%) and Instarem Amaze (1%)?Do share your options please. Thanks for reading my post.,btohqsg
I was about the ask the same question as Grab has ping me that i have used up 75% of my limit. :),btohqsg

Two ways:1) Another headcount for GPMC2) Citi Cashback+ MC (1.6%) with Amaze (0.5% local) is good enough for 2.1%,btohqsg
Before CDC nerf their card rewards  my plan is to use AMEX to GPMC to pay for insurance  which is 1.5-1.7% much simpler to do.Then apply for UOB One for cardup for all the monthly recurring bank transfers that not available on AXS mobile. Once I hit $500 or $1000 on UOB One then switch to CDC for 3%. Because UOB One capped their cashback for all their tiers.,btohqsg
I’m continuing to use CDC until end of my 180 days staking period. Then will see again whether to continue using CDC or use Citi caskback plus 1.6%.,btohqsg
Top up Grab card using Amex to pay insurance with Giro still works  right?,btohqsg
UOB one Cashback is $50  100 or 200 dollars and not a true percentage?,btohqsg
Hi folks  do you know what's the best way to switch from one broker to another? How can I transfer my portfolio with minimal costs?,btohqsg
Or more specifically  I'm considering switching from Tiger to Syfe Trade,btohqsg
Syfe doesn't allow transfer in shares so you would need to sell your stock and buy back.,btohqsg
I don't think you can transfer out from tiger too.,btohqsg
But there's not much benefit to consolidate them. You can hold them seperately,btohqsg
Oh..you can  but it's very expensive. Cheaper to sell and buy back for most case  but you might lose out on spread.,btohqsg
Just have 2 acc. Use different strategy and mentality for both account.,btohqsg
Hmm  I wonder do it means I can get my indigo card for free already? Last time I was in ruby  and I top up 500 CRO to 5K CRO then get to know if upgrade card need 50SGD so I decided not to get the card,btohqsg
I may check with cdc support team later,btohqsg
Base on a few very old YT videos  if you received your card before. Any upgrade replacement card is $50. Don’t rmb is USD or SGD.,btohqsg
You can still get the benefit  but probably won’t get the lounge access because it’s tag to the actual physical card. Unless you can the staff your card in the app.,btohqsg
Yes this one I know  from what just now the update tweet from Kris crypto .com“We will waive the card upgrade fee ($50) until further notice”Seems like something I can get card upgrade for free? 🤔,btohqsg
"ahhh. I think they just want more ""funding"" from the card community. I'm not a expert in crypto field. Only in for the visa card",btohqsg
Yes the $50 is waived now  I just requested for an upgrade,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just did a bit more research (calculations rather) on the Instarem Amaze card as I noticed the cashback portion as indicated in the picture was only 0.5%. More importantly  the cap on the cashback has been revised to $50 per quarter since 1 Apr 2022. In essence  it would mean a few things:(1) To achieve the cap of $50 cashback for the quarter on the Amaze card  one would need to spend $10k across the 3 months. Coupled with the Citi Cashback of 1.6% (this varies according to the types of purchases) that would reach a combined min cashback of $210 for the $10k spent for the Citi cashback and Instarem Amaze combo.(2) What the first point imply would be that the difference between the continued use of my Amex-UOB (without Grab MC) which carries an unlimited cashback of 1.7% (or $170)  would be a difference of $40 cashback across 3 months for $10k spent. A bit more tracking work for some meagre returns.(3) It does not  however  mean that the Instarem Amaze card is not useful. Just that the most substantial difference is a $40 across 3 months. Any additional spending would fall back on the Citi cashback card of 1.6%. It would also imply that any further expenditure above $10k for the quarter would diminish the difference in the cashback and one would be better off to continue using the pure Amex-UOB Absolute card thereafter  even if it is without the Grab MC pairing.(4) In that regard  as I am not a person who could keep close tabs such that I would remember to switch card at my $10 001 expenditure every quarter  I am willing to give up that additional $40 cashback per quarter and to keep my credit card collection to the minimum  least I get charged for the annual fee unknowingly. To that end  I would also probably not realise that I am reaching my Grab spending limit if not for the reminder prompted.Just a recap that the above situation is unique to individuals who had reached the Grab spending limits and are considering the Instarem Amaze as an alternative. The above are just my personal observation and calculations. Everyone’s spending habits and needs are different. I am merely sorting out the card usage from my expenditure habits. Yours would likely be different. Feel free to chime in especially if there are any disagreements with the calculations.Thanks for reading!,btohqsg
? Still upgrade after down cashback,btohqsg
With cro token potential drop further. The risk is definitely not worthwhile.,btohqsg
I think Instarem really nerfed their card to really beneficial only for FX fee  like online foreign currency spending and spending overseas.,btohqsg
I’m already holding jade green card. Not going to upgrade.Even with the updated 2% cashback. With 50USD ~ 68SGD cap  I need to spend $3400 to reach that cap. The cap wasn’t a big hit for SG because MAS limit annual transaction to 30k  which avg to $2500 a month.Of cause unless you have single or multiple big ticket item to buy in that one single month then too bad.,btohqsg
For my case  I already had that level of Cro inside  but didn’t opt for upgrade card. With currently free upgrade VISA card  then I can get the benefits like airport lounge and also overseas atm usage.,btohqsg
I see. Tot u stake more to upgrade. Does not really make sense since cro coin is going to perform badly.,btohqsg
I am wondering if anyone knows how the dondonki and sheng siong diners club work? Or is there better card benefits for those?I know the POSB everyday card works well for sheng siong.,btohqsg

Hi can check anyone knows what’s the minimum amount of coin like for Bitcoin and other coins for Hodlnaut to earn interest?,btohqsg
I want to write something to my followers regarding the recent stock market and crypto crash/correction.Money can always earn again  don't lose sleep and health over it. Easier said than done right? But...Let's bring it back to the teenage days where you had no money  and your favourite hobby is playing computer or video games after coming home from school. Life was simple and happy isn't it?We had no money back then or even the concept of money  but life will still go on. Your family and loved ones will continue turning old. Maybe to you this amount of realized/unrealized loss is a big amount to you right now. But if you zoom it out  maybe you have to delay retirement by a few months  or maybe a few years (based on your income).So take a break  conviction cannot be borrowed. If you feel stressed up and mentally unwell  then maybe de-risking a bit may help with your condition. If your finances are fundamentally solid (emergency funds  good cash flow  low debt)  then nothing much to worry about  hold on to good assets and companies  and reduce leverage.This too  shall pass. And you will recover too.- Chris@HoneyMoneySG,btohqsg
thanks Chris !!! this really relieve after lost several month salaries cost of investment within hours,btohqsg

With the UOB One nerf  all the new working adult will be very interested in OCBC Frank and ipaymy,btohqsg
"Just a question  is it possible to do ""normal"" bank transfer to another personal account and earn the cash back?",btohqsg
I just looked up OCBC Frank  it has $25 cap on Online Spending. So effectively you only get 4.16% if you spend $600 on the card via ipaymy  and minus the process fee the net cashback is only 1.91% instead of 4%. But still better than UOB One with net cashback of 1.08%.But overall ipaymy + OCBC is still better at 1.91% effective total cashback if you only spend $600 on ipaymy  But if you are spending more than $1000 on these kind of online payment services  I think it is better for you to use UOB One with Cardup. Example  $1000 UOB One + Cardup = $33.33 VS $1000 Frank + ipaymy = $25. But do take note that you need to make total of 5 eligible transaction monthly to be eligible for UOB cashback.,btohqsg

Would prefer cashback  heard that miles valuation will always change 🤔,btohqsg
Usually large spending is more worth it in miles but if you want cashback  you can look at:UOB ONEhttps://bit.ly/HM-UOB-ONEHSBC Advance Visahttps://bit.ly/sgadvance,btohqsg
Hi guys. Anyone can advice where we can still buy Luna now?,btohqsg

Wanted to know too  asked this question before but no answer yet,btohqsg
You max out 30K on your grab already?,btohqsg
No la still have just need different alternative...,btohqsg
For example  Stock X is 1000 USD per share  and I buy 100.1 USD of it  which is 0.1001 share  but actually what I will get is 0.100 share due to rounding on Syfe Trade. Am I correct? If so  then Syfe Trade is not really fee-free  🙁,btohqsg
Based on the fact that the minimum unit on Syfe Trade is 0.001 share  if you buy a stock that's N dollars per share  then at most you will lose N/1000 dollars just because of rounding,btohqsg
They don't round down.. just a most interfaces it's rounded,btohqsg
where do you get this qty?,btohqsg
I checked Syfe APP and the PDF statement they sent me  only 3 digits,btohqsg
you're right  seems that they only hide extra digits in the main interface 🤣,btohqsg
"if you sell  click sell all and not type the ""rounded"" full amount. You can click the question mark to confirm the amount",btohqsg
one more question  now I can see how many shares I own  but how can I check the precise shares I bought in a single order,btohqsg
in view order details page  it's rounded to 0.001 only,btohqsg
I believe you can do math yourself. Order value / price. Make sure it's both same currency.,btohqsg
May I know what syfe app best use for? Us stock sg stock or,btohqsg
You can only buy US stocks on Syfe,btohqsg

💨 Dash PET 1.3% interest:https://bit.ly/sgdashCODE DASH-RXQ45,btohqsg
For Dash PET it seems that for first 10k for 1st year  the best rate is 1.5% after selecting inclusion for some insurance  which has no penalty/downside upon account closure (just 0.70sgd for each paynow withdrawal)  although rates are not guaranteed (worst case is just take bac principle minus 70cents transaction fee right?)--For the first policy year  1.30% p.a. up to S$10 000 and 0.30% p.a. for subsequent amount in Account Value. Crediting rates are non-guaranteed. Additional 0.2% p.a. to the existing 1.3% p.a. returns for your first S$10 000 Dash PET savings during the first policy year while the complimentary protection is active.,btohqsg

I am interested with this too. Is it capital will guarantee safe? However the 1.5% is non guarantee?,btohqsg
For Dash Pet is the after the 1 year because it's no longer 1.5%.,btohqsg

Hi guys. Just want to check  how do I stake the $500 for my ruby steel card?,btohqsg
Do I need to use the uob abso -> gpmc -> revolut method?,btohqsg
Or just normal credit card is fine for the $500 stake,btohqsg
Is this better than the usual “high-interest” saving bank account like OCBC 360? Any recommendations for storage of cash?,btohqsg
You can buy $500 worth of crypto with fiat via fast transfer also,btohqsg
The UOB absolute > gpmc > ruby steel is to stack the Cashback. 1.7% + 2%,btohqsg
Topping up or buying crypto with normal credit card may have unwanted fees incurred,btohqsg
I thought revolut is to save on the DCC though?,btohqsg
There's no longer any fees via grab,btohqsg
Damn  my gpmc alr hit 75% limit for the year,btohqsg
So no DCC at all right via grab.,btohqsg
Okay can  I shall stake the $500 to get my ruby cdc. Thanks!,btohqsg
Do it before 30 may to get 2% Cashback instead of 1%.,btohqsg
There's double referral rewards now too if your new,btohqsg
30/5 they nerf to 1% again meh,btohqsg
I thought they reversed the nerf to 2%,btohqsg
Ya...ruby nerfed to 0.5% then to 1% then to 2% until 30 May (till 180 days stake up) then back to 1%,btohqsg
Wa like that not worth  if it's just 1% after 30 May.,btohqsg
1% is after your 180day stake,btohqsg
So you can still get 2% if you stake before 30 may. All stake starting after 30 may will take also start with 1%,btohqsg
Then the cro rewards from my spendings will also be 2% during the stake period?,btohqsg
Ruby = Spending 2% during your 180 days stake period + free Spotify. No rewards on the staked amount.,btohqsg
Okay I get it now  thanks. And no additional fees using gpmc to top up cdc card anymore right? So the revolut step can be skipped.,btohqsg
Fantastic  thanks for your help. 🙃🙃,btohqsg
For amaze card if u use the card to tap and using gpay does it make a difference ?,btohqsg
That means all the purchase will come as online payment..Will be eligible for rewards,btohqsg

I am trying to get some S&P 500. Which broker have lowest fee?Also read need to get from London exchange (15%) to avoid the 30% tax. Right?,btohqsg
Trillions in value erased: Only eight companies (of the 500 in the index) are responsible for nearly half of the weighted benchmark's year-to-date losses. Declines at Netflix (NFLX) have reached 70%  Meta (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA) are each down 43%  while Microsoft (MSFT)  Apple (AAPL)  Amazon (AMZN)  Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have fallen between 23% and 36% YTD. Under a theoretical model  if S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPGI) (CME) designed an equal weighting to the entire S&P 500  the index would only be down 13% in 2022 (but investors would also not have experienced the massive gains they notched in previous years).,btohqsg

https://youtu.be/kUK7EHd2c6E@ChrisHMSGI try to follow your step to send FTX > Hodlnaut for free. However in hodlnaut I didn’t see any ETH or USDT via SOL network already. Can help advice?,btohqsg
FTX to Hodlnaut is via ERC20,btohqsg
Make sure it's the FTX Blockfolio app  not Ftx Pro,btohqsg
Ok checking I may skip a step,btohqsg
Yeap I’m using Blockfolio not the pro,btohqsg
Wanted to transfer from Pro to Blockfolio. Currently inside is USD.,btohqsg
Is it the transfer much be either ETH or USDT from pro to blockfolio?,btohqsg
What is the final crypto you want at Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
You can just deposit USD into FTX(Blockfolio)  then withdraw as USDC to Hodlnaut,btohqsg
no need so many steps per that video,btohqsg
Ok understand didn’t know that initially as I follow the video step,btohqsg
I try to check how much is FTX to Hodlnaut via ETH,btohqsg
It will be 2.5 USDC from FTX pro (USDC) to Hodlnaut,btohqsg
I believe it should be higher as FTX mentioned: “FTX covers about half of blockchain fees on average”,btohqsg
Yeah 2.5 is quite low already  skip all the inconvenience and time,btohqsg
Yes and now every second counts in Hodlnaut and the 30 + 20 USDC rewards which I am planning to get 30 days later,btohqsg
2.5 USDC is considered low.or you can buy and stake 25 FTT as another optionelse the BlockFolio one which has been covered aplenty,btohqsg
hmm the countdown timer shouldn’t have started unless you’ve already done the first deposit,btohqsg
again  I’ll say don’t be too obsessed with fees - going for a 100% no-fee is sometimes not an efficient use of time.consider your personal optimum amount of hassle and whether the money you saved is worth the time you spent.perhaps  do it once for the science  to understand the flow.,btohqsg
I get where you’re coming from 🙂,btohqsg

not really  I would suggest you should read T&Cs about their sign-up programs  which might state that you need to keep that card for at least 12 months  or they might claw back the gift,btohqsg
that's the case of Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
Noob question. Bought S27 using poem  anyone know how to sell?,btohqsg

Hello  just curious which cards do you guys use for dining transactions?,btohqsg
I use OCBC 365 as it has cash back 6%,btohqsg
Citi cashback card  and amaze card 6.5% for dining,btohqsg
Is ur qn in relation to anything? 😅,btohqsg
Haha I used to do miles card vs cashback comparison. Miles outperforms. But after covid happens  not sure if it is still the same. See if anyone still looking at miles,btohqsg
I am actually. Just started plus I switched from cashback to miles recently,btohqsg
Folks  any content idea for cpf topics? Long time never talked about it,btohqsg
You Pretty much covered it all already.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the cards y’all use!,btohqsg
Hi! I'm curious to know if anyone used Hugo app before? How's your experience like?,btohqsg
Ok I just searched for 'Hugo' & saw some chatter above  thanks!,btohqsg
maybe can do one on how the recent messaging from govt seems to move away from the idea that CPF is a bank account from 55,btohqsg
don't take MAS regulation as blanket assurance for anything at all,btohqsg
Just read tru  saw that it is regulated as major payment institution by MAS.,btohqsg
must check specifically what they are being approved for,btohqsg
But if you dine in hotels be careful as the code will be under hotel code so i only use it for independent restaurants only.  I use MCO card (Chronos card 5% cashback) for dining eg at the Grand Hyatt  and other hotels.,btohqsg
good morning everyone. may i check  i realize my DBS World women cc n HSBC Revolution could not earn 10x point when make payment via Cardup n Ipaymy. is there any other method to earn the 10x reward when making rent payment?,btohqsg
please guide me along and Thank you all sifus🙇🏾‍♂️,btohqsg
both WWMC and HSBC Revo don't earn 10x on CardUp or ipaymy - it's been the case for some time now.in order words  specialized spending cards like WWMC and HSBC Revo won't earn 10x bonus w CardUp/ipaymyyour next best is general spending cards that generally earn 1.1 to 1.6 MPD (or 1.5% cashback)alternatively  you can consider Citi PayAll to earn 2.5MPD on Citi Premiermiles or Prestige at a 2% fee,btohqsg
😢yes. even amaze card will cease to earn by 1stJune2022 onwards,btohqsg
In this case which miles is best now?,btohqsg
the approach to miles should be earn to burn  not earn to keep/stakeso depending on which locations you wanna go  you can decide which miles programme you prefer- most Singaporeans like SQ so Krisflyer is preferred + Star Alliance (all miles credit card can earn Krisflyer miles)- there are other miles programme w/ other airlines worth looking into (Citibank has the most number of exchange partners)on which Miles Credit Cardthere's usually a two-pronged approach when it comes to miles card:(1) Specialized Spending cards- cards which give an upsized bonus on specific categories (10x points or 4miles per dollar (4MPD)- they usually don't have min. spending but a spending cap per month:- DBS WWMC (S$2K/month via online only)- UOB PPV (S$1K/month via mobile app paywave)- UOB VS (S$2K/month via mobile app paywave  min S$1K)- Citi Rewards MC/Visa (S$1K/month via online  exclude travel)- HSBC Revo (S$1K/month via Paywave + Online)(2) General Spending Card- all other spending fall into here (charity  education  healthcare  etc.)- or if you exceed your specialized spending  you can also use these- all major banks have their own general spending card- AMEX has Krisflyer Blue/Ascend- Citi has Premiermiles  Prestige- OCBC has 90°N  Voyage- DBS has Altitudeand morebut everyone has different needs  different spending patterns  etc.(1) examine your own spending habits and see if a specialised spending card can cover most of them(2) see if it's worth getting a general spending card from the same bank so your miles pool togetheredit: I learnt all the above from the Milelion and the Milelion community over the years 🙏🏻,btohqsg
yea..basically i spend a chunk of it 750 per month just for rent but seems like this amount will only earn me in the General Spending card now.,btohqsg
ima use either renthero for DBS Altitude or Citi Premier payall as both i check can get like 1.2,btohqsg
Hi  is this only for DBS? Or even citi REwards card?,btohqsg
this for DBS. i think Citi Reward still allow Amaze transaction 😃,btohqsg
Citi PayAll is now 2.5 MPD till 31 July 2022,btohqsg
Thanks! I thought so too.. amaze should change their prefix AMAZE* so that DBS cant track.. hahaNot sure if thats the way it works.,btohqsg
it's just a cat and mouse gamemust accept that change is the name of the game,btohqsg
take note that even for Amaze  the underlying MCC still needs to be valid for 10X bonus,btohqsg
"may i check  i have citi premiermiles card  and when i wan to apply for citi reward cc  and it states ""promotion applicable for New card holder""  means im not eligible?",btohqsg
Not anymore..New card holder means that dont have any citi card for the past 12 months as a principal cardholder.,btohqsg
not eligiblemost banks when they say NTB  they literally mean no previous credit card relationship in the last 12 months,btohqsg
Only AMEX runs promotions that are New to Card,btohqsg
"Have you done a ""Should we keep our money in CPF or are there better alternatives?""As someone who's self-employed  I personally would rather keep my money to myself  but there are those people who believe in contributing to CPF cos of the benefits.I never had the time to do extensive research on this topic.",btohqsg
might be a bad comparison but CPF is like having tuition - it’s getting someone to guide you along  or personal finance on training wheels.I think most people (including myself) often overestimate our own ability ot manage finances - so maybe CPF isn’t that bad (other than the withdrawal age that changes as life expectancy increases)—-alternatively  see it as diversification.- people who see it this way often see CPF funds as fungible as cash- so CPFOA/SA function as a bond component in overal investment portfolio (4% SA MA),btohqsg
may be can talk about whether to top up cash in SA or transfer from OA to SA,btohqsg
"Thank you for your input... How is it ""as fungible as cash""?",btohqsg
ah my bad - for certain spending - like housing  children education and healthcare,btohqsg
I think it all depends on the context  individual money personality  investor profile  etc.but if it’s done purely to lower taxes (i.e. you are just a small amount shy from lowering the tier/bracket)  maybe it’s worth considering.but if it’s purely to grow money then it goes back to how you see CPF or what kind of role in plays in your investment portfolio.—my personal realisation is that as a young adult - my priority is to increase my income as much as possible so that:- I reach BHS asap- then my MA contributions goes into my SA- only do topup to SA when it makes sense to cut tax- I invest my OA elsewhere through other mechanisms,btohqsg
not sure if u have talked about this before  but OA to SA transfer to fill up SA asap vs leaving some room in SA for RSTU tax relief may be useful?,btohqsg
can cover for young adult and also those that nearing retirement ..,btohqsg
Hi  can I clarify on this.If Amaze is paired with CRM  I would imagine all transactions made would appear as online spend  and that would have earned the 10x rewards?,btohqsg
yes provided the underlying MCC (merchant category code) is eligible for 10x bonustravel spending  even if online  doesn't earn 10x,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask If Amazed paired CRM  if the transaction below eligible for 10x?1. Top up on Grab pay2. Pay for grab transport or grab mart3. Pay on dining or grocery?,btohqsg
(1) no(2) yes(3) yesCitibank awards upon posting so it's pretty quick to check too,btohqsg

Is there any loop to shopee?,btohqsg
Just to share jipay also gives 1.5% cashback if we use it to top up EZ-Link which is quite good.,btohqsg
