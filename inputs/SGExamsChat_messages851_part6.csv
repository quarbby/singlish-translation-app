Oh simple reason:1. Heard of top down management for many gov sectors2. Personally  there's a very true stigma that scholars get preference for like promotions etc esp those like president scholars.3. I heard first hand from psc scholars that they quit because their superiors constantly take credit for their work .All of these can exist in private sectors (MNCs) but more evident in gov sectors .,btohqsg
