US crude inventories tumbled by 11.5 million barrels last week  far exceeding expectations for a 2.9 million barrel decline. A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico also stoked fears of supply disruptions  keeping investors on edge. Moreover  oil and other risk assets got a boost from a weakening dollar as signs that the US economy may be cooling raised hopes the Federal Reserve would lighten its policy stance.,btohqsg

HP Incfell the most in more than three years after cutting its profit outlook and acknowledging that a rebound in personal-computer demand isn’t coming as quickly as hoped. The Palo Alto  California-based computer supplier pared back its adjusted profit forecast to a range of US$3.23 to US$3.25 a share  down from US$3.30 to US$3.50. It also reduced its outlook for full-year cash flow. Shares plunged as much as 11 per cent as trading got underway in New York on Wednesday (Aug 30)  the most since May 2020. PC makers have been struggling to stage a comeback since sales fell off a cliff in a post-pandemic bust. HP had been hoping for a more robust recovery in the second half of 2023 with back-to-school and holiday seasons bolstering sales. Tuesday’s outlook cuts have instead thrown the timing of any significant rebound into question.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Breakfast Set Meal - 31 August 2023🎉Weaker economic data on both labor front and GDP helped to support the narrative for the Fed to be less aggressive on rate hike  as investors now cheer towards weak economic data that showed resiliency towards a soft landing.Major corporate earnings continued to roll in with Salesforce and Crowdstrike taking the lead.Here's what you need to know in 90 seconds :https://moneynmeaning.com/2023/08/weaker-economic-data-boost-lower-rate-hike/It is 31 August  Thursday  8.55 am in Singapore and 8.55 pm in New York. It was a swinging market but turned steady as investors digested a better outlook of a soft landing and a lower possibility of a rate hike.Have a splendid day at work and in school.As always  cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
