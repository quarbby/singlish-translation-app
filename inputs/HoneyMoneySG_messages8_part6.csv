Hi Chris. Personally I have tried using ezlink Mastercard via Google pay it went through.  Just FYI.,btohqsg
How long till Jipay's cashback get tracked? Transferred from jipay to ezlink mastercard  havent received any news yet,btohqsg
in my experience  the JiPay will show there is 1.5% cashback green color font indication immediately  but the real cash will be credited on the first day of the following month,btohqsg
Show 1.5% in recent transactions issit?,btohqsg
It shows the top ups  but didnt show the $500 that I used to top up my ezlink wallet  but the $500 is is alr in my ezlink,btohqsg
Did I top up my ezlink wrongly? Hahaha,btohqsg
"I think ""Top-up"" mentioned above is to add to your JiPay balance  not to the EzLink",btohqsg
Yea but my jipay balance $0 already because I transferred to ezlink,btohqsg
Is it correct to link the jipay card in this page and transfer the $ to ezlink here?,btohqsg
Any reason why the $500 + cashback not showing up on this page?,btohqsg
You shall be able to see the historical top up,btohqsg
not sure why. Have you reached the 30$ cashback cap?,btohqsg
Yes the $ is in my ezlink  I just got my card yesterday and tried out today  this is my first transaction using jipay,btohqsg
Just saw this at sheng siong and signed up. Posting here for people who are interested about it,btohqsg
Did lots of people use diner club card?,btohqsg
FYI  BOC Sheng Siong card is 6% rebate at Sheng Siong  1.5% for all other spend  no min spend. And its Visa aka way more accepted.,btohqsg
Dayum should have tot about that,btohqsg
But is it for all spending ?,btohqsg
Look like better deal. Just no sheng siong around my place.,btohqsg
1.5% for all other spending  but the usual exclusions apply  aka no ins premium etc.,btohqsg
6% is for all spending at Sheng Siong,btohqsg
BOC sheng siong card is it good base on your experience ?,btohqsg
I only really use it at Sheng Siong hahah cause now stacking on Jipay,btohqsg
But the application was a pain  the BOC website screwed up one  I ended up snail mailing in my card application,btohqsg
what are the benefits or cashback for ezlink pay?,btohqsg
The benefit is that ezlink is supposedly an eligble merchant for the 1.5% cashback from jipay as you can see from@nickyshscreenshots aboveMy question is  i did not get the 1.5% cashback and afaik  I did all the steps correctly  anyone knows why? Do I need to contact jipay support?,btohqsg
yup I went there to top up  sent all my screenshots above,btohqsg
no other cards linked to my ezlink wallet yet so I won't top up wrongly,btohqsg
