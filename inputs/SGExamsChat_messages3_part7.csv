Studying interests in school and picking up practical stuff on the side is for the High SESLow SES have to study practical stuff in school and pick up interests on the side,btohqsg
Philosophy was something that I was very interested in for a time,btohqsg
Did not observe that distinction to be valid ðŸ˜•,btohqsg

Official yet to be declared  leaning more towards political science.,btohqsg
Case in point: Folks I saw worked whenever they were off class  and that's where they picked up the technical practical skills. Motivation was that they were paid too  so class time was where they nerded out.,btohqsg

Being here has made me realize that I donâ€™t know a lot about uni education. Does anyone have advice for younger kids aspiring to get a uni education?,btohqsg

Ah to be a JC kid,btohqsg
i guess it helps to read up on each course and cancel out which you definitely don't want to go to to reduce the range,btohqsg
well  same goes for poly as well if you intend to go for poly,btohqsg
except you have to decide much sooner,btohqsg
Well do you have any career in mind,btohqsg
Iâ€™m in poly but I was forced by my parents to take a course that I absolutely despise but Iâ€™m still hoping to get into my desired uni course,btohqsg
Yeah I wanna do Psychology studies,btohqsg

Internships at startups  doing business development  or marketing. Some gathered together to start small businesses. Some folks here are probably already doing it too.,btohqsg
"The tricky thing is that the course you'll study  what the school is like  can be completely different from what the work and job is like at the end. Without a clear end goal for life direction in mind  it's easy to be led by the nose and always be ""hoodwinked"". That being said  research never hurts. And figuring your ""end goal"" takes years. But can be done as long as you start working on it.",btohqsg
yong siew toh conservatory of music,btohqsg
I wish I could've gone a music course,btohqsg
Mega tilted cuz I was good in neither math nor physics in my secondary school and they decided to kill me like this,btohqsg
Which is why I avoided engi like the plague,btohqsg

if you don't like the course you're in it's really hard to do well,btohqsg

More like my dad is kind of like a vindictive little (well  big) tyrant in mine and my siblingsâ€™ lives,btohqsg
