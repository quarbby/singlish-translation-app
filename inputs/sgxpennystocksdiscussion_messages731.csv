Today GEO Energy ($0.390) got pull down to $0.360 from the day opening $0.42 when GEAR crashed downHowever  it did recover well and closed $0.390. Judging from the long wick  it shows that buyers came back and took control. Also  I think the MMs took opportunity to stop hunt many stop losses below $0.390 today and collect cheap from those who cut.The quick price recovery highly likely related to the upcoming results (14/11/2022)Bearing in mind that GEO energy is somewhat debt free  cash rich and have done SBB as high as $0.37 in Oct21  I would say those who got in cheap in the flash drop was lucky 🍀 indeed .Results  I believe will be an improved one and might be record breaking as many countries prepare for winter  with the ongoing war in Russia etc.Tomorrow  I won’t be surprised they might recover to $0.40 as a first step. Somehow  if so  we will know that the upcoming results going to be very strong if that happens.DYODD,btohqsg
And gear go bk 90 😂,btohqsg
Here is GEO record results for 1H2022 on Aug22. Also COAL India just reported yesterday profit soaring due to shortages (2 Fold increase)Thus  the same should be expected of GEO energy too. It’s just supply and demand situation here.,btohqsg
will these affect Golden Energy too?,btohqsg
The last few times with long rejection wick. The next couple candles usually very bullish,btohqsg
Yup they both dealing with coal business and demand is still strong for coal actually.GEAR last announced they are in talks for possible deal  so hope that comes in soon and change their plight.Quite a sad plight to be shorted like that,btohqsg
i see the trend looking good. was holding till i got a shock today,btohqsg
thanks dude. hopefully  tide turns soon. :),btohqsg
Geo 2q results?I still recalled next day after results gap down and dump all the while to 0.345 after week.I cut loss  don’t touch,btohqsg

Based on last half yearly results of GEO.- GEO is at slightly over 2x PE wise- 6 months Net profit $106mil- CASH Holdings of $176mil- NAV $0.3758Also  to add . Their recent share-buyback on OCT 3rd  they spent $1 mil to clear 3 levels $0.355 to $0.370. They have plenty of available CASH on hand to protect themselves shareholders from short sellers.,btohqsg
anyway  I only can rem 2021 early last Qtr I'mkeeps complainingwhy my ep near 20c paid div. geo geo not moving and bo give div. gear⚙️ already fr. near 30c cheong to 50c on mid Oct '21.. 🤣,btohqsg
历史会不断的重演 但不是简单的重复.If we looks at past 03 wavebands of gear⚙️  it took approx 2-3wks to drop approx. -30% to -40% once hit ATH..but we're surprised today waveband4 just took one day fr. 92.5c to low 62.5c at fibo 61.8% was approx. -32%,btohqsg
From GEO half year statement  the top 3 customer by country are1) China2) Indonesia3) IndiaBased on the above extracts  we can somehow have a gauge of what to expect in next week results due to the mentioned shortages and increased demand the coal.It all point to the fact that coal demand is still very strong.Note that their NAV increased from $0.3339 to $0.3758 in the corresponding period too.This time round upon results   the NAV should easily go past $0.40 too  IMO.,btohqsg
At a glance  GEO dividends paid out have been consistent and given out on every quarterly since 2021.  Quite amazing  for 3 quarters 2022 they have given 23% yield.Being cash rich  they have no problem paying out dividends and as long as war is ongoing =coal demand still strong  GEO will continue to be a good investment for many.,btohqsg
so wat offer will give ?,btohqsg
Shareholders have 2 options in GEAR delist offerOption 1: illustrative consideration $1.045(1)GEMS Shares (IDX) and (2)Offer Exit offer)(1) Pro-Rata entitlement of 1.3936 GEMS shares per GEAR sharePLUS(2) $0.16 cash exit offerOption 2: illustrative consideration $0.846(1)discounted GEM cash consideration) and (2)Offer Exit offer)(1) $0.686 per sharePLUS(2) $0.16 cash exit offerSource:https://www.sgx.com/mobileapp?action=view&cat=company-announcements&id=B599T1IV2BCR696W,btohqsg
Today short sellsGEO energy$5 454 729.5014 068 100 sharesGEAR$3 222 303.004 437 300 shares,btohqsg
Based on delist offer presented  GEAR which closed $0.67 yesterday will open $0.84 to $1.04 later.Considering that short sellers came in yesterday. We might see some big cover happen at the start as they will scurry to cover especially if they are naked or CDP shorts and have not covered back yesterday.GEO will open minimum $0.405 to $0.410 today too based on GEAR offer and GEO will have short squeeze right from the get go .Those who got in yesterday really big bargain and got the nice durians,btohqsg
Illustration on those who opt to open IDX brokerage and accept GEM shares with CashWhich amounts to $1.045/share based on current GEM price.,btohqsg
Illustration of those who decide to accept discount cash consideration of GEM and exit offer (Full Cash amount) of $0.846/share,btohqsg
GEAR offer of $0.84(full cash offer) or $1.04 (GEM shares and cash) where their NAV is $0.4280 with a (trailing PE of 3.5x) puts this offer at more than double the NAV of GEARLet’s put it into context of their other coal buddyIf GEO (PE of 2x) and NAV of $0.37x does ever get an delist offer  the price should amount to $0.6x as a minimum.Therefore with GEAR offer as generous as it is  GEO is 1 to watch.I believe short sellers for GEAR and GEO got tricked today big time by the news (old IMO) Later will be a big squeeze. GEO results will be solid based on the year end strong demand for coal and I believe we should see $0.45 easily and soon for GEO.Keep GEO in watchlist and buy list as we approach the upcoming results (14th Nov 22),btohqsg
IMO this is the news yesterday that whoever in control used to throw down and scare out shareholders. (Note: Old news as such news have been out before) and if there is money to be earned  who would reject?Furthermore GEO is not affected by this as they as cash cash rich and don’t need bank funding.One thing the GEAR MMs did today  they flushed and scared out many retailers who could have benefited from this offer but yet cut losses. Unfortunate indeed and unlucky for those who watched todays market. It is not easy to hold the position I would say.Those who didn’t watch and had no auto SL in place were the winners,btohqsg
Saved by the offer bro. I think might open $0.84 to $0.90,btohqsg
GEAR news leaked  pressed down to accumulate more... GEAR should halt the trading yesterday morning if they are planning for the exit offer. i think they just want to show that their exit offer look nice compared to yesterday closing price,btohqsg
Yup precisely what they did   brutal I say   retailers died and SMART MONEY took over!,btohqsg
No choice   need to make the offer look better,btohqsg

GEAR offer options in a nutshell,btohqsg
Sure have one and CDP shorts I believe,btohqsg
Those who shorted GEO based on GEAR also going to kenna big,btohqsg
Sure scared now and panic to cover,btohqsg
Because they know they kenna bluff. They thought the business times news was catalyst but I believe MMs on offerer side managed to get the reporter to throw out the news for them to justify as catalyst to short it down,btohqsg
Seriously well played man I said,btohqsg
Smart money is smart money   different level,btohqsg
GEO to open 405 today . My predictions,btohqsg
I hope no one hurt bad from yesterday man,btohqsg
yesterday  BB using less bullet to short below 85  to attract more panic selling  then they can accumulate more around 60/70 plus. Dirty trick,btohqsg
Ownself short to 85 let market panic throw all e way to 625..big big earn earn,btohqsg
Yup .. total manipulation in play. GEO was forced down to look real in the process. Dirty as coal.,btohqsg
80-90% of retailers would have cut alot got stopped out . Now they in control,btohqsg
Coal is a dirty business  whoever is in needs or know how to get their hands dirty .,btohqsg
Coal price been shooting high yet so many companies can close shops,btohqsg
Suck ppl blood wait for karma,btohqsg
Will the dirty player deliberately make the offer failed after TP from the mkt?,btohqsg
They see gear keep stay 89-92..爱死不起。。anw good tactics 😂,btohqsg
if you are looking at the share price plunging   it will be auto-stoploss reaction,btohqsg
cant they just share profit amongst us  who actually make an effort to supported the price above 85 !!,btohqsg
Today trading range should be 78 to 90 cts,btohqsg
Probably above 80c ba since full cash offer is that,btohqsg
Not many small holders will be interested in GEMS shares. So 84 cts discounted back,btohqsg
Yeah i was looking at that only.,btohqsg
But maybe reporter also don’t know about the intentions behind,btohqsg
So tdy focus on geo/gear or bio/cb,btohqsg
Anw if open above 80 jiu fun lor,btohqsg
Ysday those cut loss bang wall,btohqsg
If GEO does gets offered  it will be in the end $0.6x range based on how GEAR offer went.IF...Anyways  GEAR offers shows light that coal business does have demand still. I believe bumper dividends and record results next week for GEO. Hold on tight. Based on some studies on the demand in their top 3 nations they supply their coal to  China  Indonesia  India.It is high probability that we will see record increase next week,btohqsg
Geo is net debt negative. No need to worry about interest rate movements.,btohqsg
exactly  they have $176milBank loans - $3mil,btohqsg
Today go along the Geo  ride with uptrend price movement and will be next be Potentially to consider delisting in near future,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 9 November 2022🎉💰Searching for direction🧮Equity markets rose with Americans marching towards the poll for midterm elections. There are two hopes: the rise of a red wave and for the Fed to pivot.With the expectation of a Republican sweep  possibly a split government  investors see the gridlock situation as positive on both policy and economic front. In addition  polls are reflecting an expectation for the Republicans to take over the House.As long as no single party has absolute control over both chambers  enacting policy would be difficult  and Democrats' aggressive fiscal spending could be tamed  a positive sign in an inflationary environment contrary to popular likes of government to spend more money.🎢The next big thing: CPI data🔫Beyond the midterm election is the CPI data that will be released on Thursday. We are seeing the 10-year Treasury yield moderating to 4.125%. The same goes for the two-year yield dropping to 4.672%.When CPI is released on Thursday  the expectation of an 8% gain on a y-o-y will be sufficient to provide relief. It will be a decline from September 8.2%. This will spur the narrative of a Fed pivot again and lift the pedal off toward an aggressive rate hike.🍟Disney – a mixed result🎲Fresh off the release is Disney. Investors were looking at three main ideas: stable visitorship and spending at theme parks  sound TV and movie businesses. Yet  there were some disappointments. First off  Disney+ posted a more comprehensive loss despite adding more subscribers. Theme parks see good revenue  but profit needs to catch up. Hence  there is a big miss on both revenue and earnings. Guidance was also poorer than investors' expectations.Pika World sees weakness as potential accumulation or long-term but cautioned on the weaker maco-environment.📱Affirm: Tough love❤️After the company also posted a weaker-than-expected earnings result  Shares of Affirm plunged an hour. The result was widely looked into as it is like a microscope towards identifying clues on the health of the consumers' wallets and how the challenging economic situation affects spending.🎤What's on the menu today?📖There aren't much key data today as investors braced for some clues on the midterm election result.It is 9 November  Wednesday  at 9.25 am in Singapore and 9.25 pm in New York. Pika World wishes you a cool and breezy day ahead!,btohqsg

Small bites on 405 GEO 104900 shares. so odd who buy,btohqsg
Don't know who will vote no 😅,btohqsg
First they issued a exit announcement to depress the price  then they issued a delisting announcement so the offer price doesn't need to be higher than the mkt price. This is against SGX delisting rules and SGX should not approve this offer.,btohqsg
Halcyon daily update  i think a bit over bgt  should hv some pullback to 280 or even 260?,btohqsg

after gg through the GEAR proposal     the offeror is very dirty     they will eat up the whole GEAR - which owned 64% of SMR(directly owned 100% of SMC). which meant that 16 cents is for the SMR/SMC and RW....,btohqsg
the offer got to make sense to offerror,btohqsg
All money go into his pocket,btohqsg
i think very fair offer actually,btohqsg
Gear should have at least halted and then let market decide.Management smelly,btohqsg
Current offer price is really low ball offer,btohqsg
cash offer should be more than $1.2,btohqsg
the early GEAR players i think buy $0.20 to $0.50,btohqsg
Geo better. Reward shareholder with generous dividend,btohqsg
If GEO get offered  what do you reckon the offer,btohqsg
Geo is better but price cannot push up,btohqsg
we always play GEO and GEAR. Best is GEM also take control of GEO.,btohqsg
Geo is worth much more. Good management.,btohqsg
like this they can control price,btohqsg
today GEO is trying to make weak hands throw 400,btohqsg
U see how they dish out dividend to shareholder u know liao,btohqsg
GEO SSH only want to collect fat dividend for the next many years .....,btohqsg
As long as GEAR price maintains  dont be hasty to throw GEO.,btohqsg

i expect GEO to hold over $220mil cash in new report based on the pattern  demand and growth.,btohqsg
