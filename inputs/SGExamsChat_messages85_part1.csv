guys how do u get a guy who obviously like you to stop texting you  ive set my boundaries very clearly and told him to stop  but he literally and i mean he literally texts me every waking hour  i dont want to make an enemy,btohqsg
or ignore because theres no way to not make an enemy out of him,btohqsg
Maybe when u set ur boundaries  he didn't know u were being serious so he continued on. But u can warn him again and tell him the to stop messaging u  and if he do it again  just block,btohqsg
he keeping using me as like a girlfriend therapist  he is obviously very lonely  ive literally told him im very busy and i feel burned out from him already  but he continues,btohqsg
and he is very nice so it's hard to reject,btohqsg
"Reply him only at night and say  ""sorry  busy day  got to go sleep""",btohqsg
He doesn't have ur phone number right?,btohqsg
he literally tells me that he notices that i am only awake from a certain time to a certain time  and that i seem to be sleeping a lot and he wonders how he can help me with it cuz it seems like im unwell,btohqsg
basically makes it so that he is really nice and im forced to talk to him,btohqsg
Yea  I guess he wants to make u feel guilty if u don't talk to him,btohqsg
Than just don't reply him and arhive his chat,btohqsg
Don't reply for a few days  he will find someone new eventually,btohqsg
If the harassment continue   just block and reportüëç,btohqsg
