Take into consideration that your car might not be sold because the price you want is not the price others want,btohqsg
All my consign car diao at my showroom 3 months all nobody buy,btohqsg
His thinking is  if sell to dealer  dealer can sell X amt  he himself sell also can see X amt,btohqsg
Yes. I just see listing price 150k. I auto deduct and give them discount 143k also worth lel since dealer taking in 130k. For example.,btohqsg
Margin really not big for dealers  still need to fight market price.,btohqsg
But now honestly market all so high 🤣🤣🤣🤣! And we see all dealer boss drive big car 🤣🤣 it just means all the profit eaten up alr 🤣,btohqsg

Are you sure now the used car price is increasing? Where got? Some parf car like Mazda 3 depre is around 9k. Mazda 5 around 10k.,btohqsg
Maybe you sold to dealer at super low price and they mark up too high to sell. They can sell if the depre is around with other similar cars.,btohqsg
You sold dealer at 130k and the market price for that car is around 140k  then they cannot be posting at 150k. Wait until cow comes nobody ring bell 😅😂,btohqsg
Consign definitely can fetch higher price than selling to dealer  but there are situations where you're better off selling to dealer. E.g. you're the 3rd owner  car used to be phv  mileage dubious,btohqsg

But they generally more cautious. Better driving style. Less aggressive wear. Prioritise regular servicing.,btohqsg
drive too cautious the carbon buuild up too much,btohqsg
Carbon buildup influenced more by poor maintenance n short trips. Female owned cars usually better maintained n less aggressive wear compared 2 male driven cars suffering from over-revving  harsh braking or higher RPMs,btohqsg
not true. female driver dont give way when u signal car they will step and speed up act blur,btohqsg
and they dont go servicing cause car still moving😂,btohqsg
engine oil every 5k or 6mths must change for best preventive maintenance,btohqsg
drive less agressive dont mean no need maintenance,btohqsg

Bro suv n sports car 2 different animal in performance.,btohqsg
U want big then sacrifice performance. The bigger the more scarification,btohqsg
I prefer small car since characteristics lean towards agility (in terms of reacting responsively) and ample clearance in tight areas such as MCSP,btohqsg
For me  the size of C-Segment SUVs is a good fit for me.,btohqsg
Have you bought your new car yet?,btohqsg
No  I rent. That’s why I did have some opinion on some cars,btohqsg
U mean which deal for the same car amongst dealers?,btohqsg
All these r small things As long as engine n gearbox ok,btohqsg
If engine or gb spoilt  ur life will be v miserable,btohqsg
lazy  don't want to do homework way: see depre  essentially tells you how much you pay per yearrecommended  do your homework: go and understand what the different prices/numbers mean. list price  depre  arf rebate  mileage etc,btohqsg
And after 20th year  it's just scrap metal,btohqsg
Even if u lucky enough to get special permission and a 3rd 10th yr COE to keep beyond 20th yr  U have to have deep pockets to revert  and inspection and all to ensure it's road worthy.,btohqsg
And at this time  makes no sense to spend $100k to renew a year 2000 car,btohqsg
I see. So should assume the value of the car after 20 years is almost negligible already.,btohqsg
Curious. Is there any way to find out or estimate what’s the percentage of PARF vs COR cars on the road?,btohqsg
Nowadays buy car so many considerations ah,btohqsg
My only consideration is loan can approve? Got money pay loan?,btohqsg
Everything else is waste time to find out,btohqsg

As in can i fix myself and if no  should i go to a seat workshop or general workshop will do? 😅,btohqsg
Anyway everything also can DIY if U have e tools and know how to,btohqsg

latest model should be more fuel efficient,btohqsg
but i think the previous generation one looks nicer,btohqsg
latest model expensive as well. Around 250K iirc,btohqsg
