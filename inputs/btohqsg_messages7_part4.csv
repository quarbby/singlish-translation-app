yes bro - take only also for me,btohqsg
Anyways  those who have numbers  can start to research on the project. Facing  west sun  which stick which unit.Do these earlier and list out preferred units. Makes your selection a lot easier. Those with shit numbers like me  don't waste time on research... Go there see what leftover and take the best of the rest.,btohqsg
yes thats right bro. its literally based on luck. if an applicant is asked to go to select a unit  and they didnt like the unit  they are deemed as rejecting this chance . then got to wait for 1 year bar,btohqsg
unless HDB tell u that the flats are all selected  if not  just take only,btohqsg
HDB has made the entire system based on luck  no strategy nor ways can get the unit you want,btohqsg
cant game the system. it has been created to prevent 1st timers to pick and choose the units they want unless luck is on their side. and for 2nd timer  it is designed to discourage them for bidding the BTO flats for the 2nd time,btohqsg
even houses  the lower units have balcony but not taller units. HDB have designed all flats not to have all the good attributes,btohqsg
the checklist of wants will never be all ticked. unless u buy private property,btohqsg
Just search woodlands may bto 2021 that one is active,btohqsg
Queenstown  some of the Dawson's projects are smaller in size,btohqsg
Yeap. Very true. Estates in the center regions mostly have this trait,btohqsg
Not really suitable for bigger families.,btohqsg
but how far is the walk to mrt,btohqsg
under the sun is no joke,btohqsg
plus if you're carrying bags of stuffs,btohqsg
which project is the nearest to MRT ah,btohqsg
Ok la. I find 8mins acceptable. Currently my parents place is close to 15,btohqsg
Soon the closest will be SkyResidences,btohqsg
But I recall seeing available units in the SBF exercise,btohqsg
Meaning it is possible to get those  albeit at a much higher price now with the current market conditions.,btohqsg
Cannot rmb. And I don't think the data is available now  since the exercise is over.,btohqsg
yes by luck  ST can get a very low number while FT can get number beyond supplies,btohqsg
Those houses are a thing tho,btohqsg
For selection unit appt   we need to print the cpf statements just in case or dont need ?,btohqsg
U can la. But I rmb for mine  it wasn't used. They basically logged in for me on their computers and printed whatever they needed.Doesn't hurt to be extra prepared.Congratulations btw.,btohqsg
U printed your transaction + contribution history or just one of it ?Thank you !! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Forgot liao hahaBut I was prepared la  whatever they asked ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Anything else for me to print except the ones stated on the appt letter ? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
it's ok if you never brought your statements along because they will ask you to produce it with the URL given to you  saves on carbon footprint,btohqsg
and payment must be by NETS,btohqsg
my mum went to select her's only brought an IC along was told to provide CPF statements and payslips within 2 weeks with a given URL,btohqsg
Ohh i see ! Ok good hahahah thank u!!,btohqsg
It's good to bring. But they will login your singpass app to link their computer as well,btohqsg
I bring all the relevant documents they asked.  But they din see it. Cos they log in my singpass to link whatever data they need for the booking.  Then they will deduct 10 or 15% of payment from your cpf and will rebate you back thr $500 deposit.,btohqsg
This I when after you booked your unit. Should be the 3rd appointment,btohqsg
$500 is for those who chosen 3r,btohqsg
Hello! Just asking if the package they will send to us will include the price for the unit?,btohqsg
it will all be inside your HDB portal under your registration number,btohqsg
speaking of which my reg no is non double digit,btohqsg
1st appt - selection exercise  2nd appt - signing of AFL  3rd appt - getting keys,btohqsg
if any of you or your SO is below 30 (from the date of application)  just need 5% payment,btohqsg
eh can I check for hitting basic retirement sum  is it just SA or OA+SA?,btohqsg
SA but I think pass 55/65 OA and SA gets combined,btohqsg
Alright noted . I printed whatever was asked on the appt letter. The rest of it if they need then i'll just email or use the url asxwmentioned ðŸ˜… thank u!,btohqsg
I still lesser thanhalf pill of water,btohqsg
noooooooooooo all of us are learning,btohqsg
Woodgrove ascent.. which BLK is bto 2 room? 3 rooms..n 4 rooms types?,btohqsg
May I ask for selection of unit do I need to get my HLE ready? And I just change a new job this payslip I only have the last month will it affect?,btohqsg
But there is no gap between the previous job and this job thus cpf contribution is constant,btohqsg
