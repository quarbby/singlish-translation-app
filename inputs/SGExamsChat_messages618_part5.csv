and how old is this guy,btohqsg
ok so legally allowed to fuck but cannot find toilet,btohqsg
you say this as though the PhD has ANYTHING to do with it,btohqsg
I thought ppl are q old when they take PhD,btohqsg
At least that's what I associated with it,btohqsg

ok understand  did you find the theory challenging ?,btohqsg
but since you're smart our standard of challenging may be different lol,btohqsg
