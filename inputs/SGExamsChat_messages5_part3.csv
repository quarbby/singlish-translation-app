i've only done bio but i think research can be veryyy taxing/dull at times but if you like it then you should definitely go for it because it teaches you a Lot beyond the classroom like application-wise etc also you make friends yay,btohqsg
3H2 people can take 2H3s without appeal I think,btohqsg
Well  you can always appeal for 2H3,btohqsg
If you get 4H2 A for promos they’ll even approve,btohqsg
Did u do nrp or astar,btohqsg
Ooooh same I want to take astar,btohqsg
It's once a week on normal school days rite,btohqsg
What do you hope to get out of H3,btohqsg
Independent work. Push button. Record data. Write skeleton of a scientific report. Present.,btohqsg
I hope to do research when I graduate,btohqsg
Nobody has any interests in the subjects  they have a lot of interest in repeating algorithms when presented with 'questions.' The 'questions' are but simple inputs to the hashmaps that make up the top scorers' brains - and the they simply just retrieve and execute the value that the inputs map to.,btohqsg
Research being not guaranteed to succeed does not mean anything  unless you desperately need a H3 Research DIST which is unlikely from negative results,btohqsg
Are you sure? Research in what? What level? How high do you hope to climb? AP in X years? Have you experienced research? Conferences?,btohqsg
That's why I want to do h3 research,btohqsg
Sounds good enough  so you want encouragement here or discouragement here?,btohqsg
Cos of the small number of ppl taking across the cohort  I have few feedbacks from seniors regarding research  would appreciate if anyone could share their experience,btohqsg
This is the general gist of what you need to do.As for experience  well  it depends on your mentor in the end. Generally you'll be extremely challenged as just about everything is out of syllabus and you might not even have the slightest requisite knowledge to even talk about what you are doing  much less 'research' and do something typically no one or little people have done before,btohqsg
You get at least a basic sense of what is research - a lot of weekends get burnt for H3  though normal research you'd just be doing on weekdays,btohqsg
I believe it's once a week and full time during holidays,btohqsg
Of the many reports I've seen  and the report I personally submitted  I'd say 95% are terrible (MERIT or lower) - with a magical few 5% who show extreme potential. I deduce this as my mentor showed me many examples of past project reports  much of which I can't remember but I can remember that there were a few who you just wonder how they can produce such quality work,btohqsg
That once a week you either squeeze after school or weekend.,btohqsg
I suppose this in itself is humbling and important - you need to accept that while you may use and build on e.g. Terence Tao's work  you likely won't even come close to what he has achieved and new breakthroughs he has made. This applies to all famous researchers (Einstein  a few multi-Nobel awardees  etc.),btohqsg
I’d spam 4 POIs every minute,btohqsg
The point is  you do research even if it gets slow and boring. You need to do good research perhaps exactly to make sure no one ever does what you did - they need only build upon it.,btohqsg
How do people know I block them on tele,btohqsg
