"Ehh I mean it's a sector that constantly lacks manpower so üíÄ  inpatient or outpatient is okie  lmao also wtv rand said and since I think the quote "" more u learn   the less u know "" applies very much to med uk lol mmm ye. Idk if it seems lofty",btohqsg
I think cos they let u explore diff fields in med sch too  that's why,btohqsg
Yea I mean it's not for money üíÄ,btohqsg
smth i tell people is to not choose careers based on what you're interested in learning,btohqsg
Starting pay not necessarily that high also,btohqsg
but what you can see yourself doing for years and years,btohqsg
Wanna see how far I can go and take it,btohqsg
my mindset comes from academia ba ig,btohqsg
but it bears similarities with med,btohqsg
if you wanna travel do a phd üëç,btohqsg
i mean it's def a pull factor of doing one,btohqsg
Naur prob end up in student debt but hey isn't life obstacles exciting,btohqsg
i'd rather my life obstacles not be financial ones,btohqsg
this is slowly treading into futureofryan territory,btohqsg
I was sane to retake Os twice just to make it such that I can barely take As HAHA,btohqsg
Between Atarax futureofryan and the true happiness person,btohqsg
Since when med sch ppl are sane to begin with,btohqsg
Ik someone who nepoed into med sch,btohqsg
Ehhh it's kinda bad but I manage to promo still uk to y2 and sincenow holi  gonna grind  ,btohqsg
Okay but ngl if u go med u need to1. Have the passion for studying med in the first place2. Want to do medicine for the future3. Know which area of medicine uw to go into like,btohqsg
Cuz alot of med students they alr know the fields rhey wanna specialise in before they go med sch,btohqsg
Uw to prove that u can do impossible shit which I get the mindset considering u are a o level retakee,btohqsg
Alot of med sch grads I meet nowadays dk what rhey wanna specialize in,btohqsg
So they sit arnd doing nth,btohqsg
If this is the doctor I get in the future,btohqsg
the people i know who went into med also liddat,btohqsg
Maybe it's just my friends then,btohqsg
They from like j1 alr knew which field they wanna go in,btohqsg
One of them wanted to do surgery he deadass brought a suturing kit to sch and just did suturing,btohqsg
i think point is you need to sit down and really think about what you wanna do and how you're gonna do it,btohqsg
but i also advise you to consider other options,btohqsg
