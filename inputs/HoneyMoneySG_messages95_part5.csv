Eh. Just from this chat we can see at least 3 people kenna Citi fraud yesterday?,btohqsg
Ok this is a genuine risk,btohqsg
Actually what‚Äôs the rationale for the scammers to run the cards through a 3DS merchant first  instead directly through a non-3DS merchant?,btohqsg
Ya la. Now I overseas also. Imagine even I call in now and incur expensive roaming. I get my card blocked how I spend.,btohqsg
Maybe to see if the number is valid?,btohqsg
But charging through non-3DS merchant achieves the same I think. If invalid number then it will error out?I‚Äôm just thinking there‚Äôs a good reason (from a scammer‚Äôs perspective) to incur extra effort going through a 2-step approach  and it bothers me a little bit not knowing why ü§î,btohqsg
What comforts me is that it is mass attack. Like the recent Uob absoluteU call in bank for fraud resolution they already know what to do.No questions asked.,btohqsg
If it charges through 3ds merchants higher chance of prompting 2fa,btohqsg
Any one has experience with this transfer in promo? Pls share üôèüôè,btohqsg
Thats why they like to test that n incur small charges first den mature the card to make it charge higher amounts but most of the time they get greedy and end up using a higher amount and you get notified of a high payment withdrawn but end of the day its a win win situation cause they get what they wanted you get your money back so nothing was ever lost even tho it may be a slow process of getting your money back,btohqsg
UserüÖ∞Ô∏èGEM HULKüÖ∞Ô∏èhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no ads,btohqsg
May be you need to chat with Webull CSO on this n share with us the result too.,btohqsg
it doesn't show up immediately   takes a few working days to update the tracker  if that was your concern,btohqsg
Funds lock up for 1 year to earn 2% !?,btohqsg
is Tiger Key having problem now? My app kept crashing,btohqsg

how about sell shares A  then didnt buy shares B  no withdrawal  $ keep in moneyBull ?,btohqsg
I got this for my Citi card last night too. Unfortunately Citi hotline cannot track which card it is and I've to replace all my cards,btohqsg
Wah Lau. No way I will replace all my cards. The pain.,btohqsg
Yup  i will just check for fraud transaction and report asap once i saw it,btohqsg
Hi what the promo of webull,btohqsg
On the fraud topic  someone just charged SGD 2340 on Apple SG with my DBS yuu VISA card. Blocked  Reported and replaced card in progress,btohqsg
Wow just to share. Charged $21.15 on my Uob one card at MacDonald for 10% cashback. Not only did the transaction take 9 calendar days to post  it actually disappeared halfway (I track my usage manually especially last week of statement cycle) and I went on to spend another $20 on another merchant just to be safe. The MacDonald transaction actually reappeared! And after my statement cutoff date. lol.,btohqsg
Yeah many people got it. But it‚Äôs the 3DS notification only. Not an actual charge,btohqsg
Mine was an actual charge despite me locking the card,btohqsg
Assuming you‚Äôre holding to retirement anyways  earning additional 2% on top of whatever capital gains and dividends you would have received anyway  not a bad deal. It‚Äôs not funds that are being locked up  it‚Äôs investments.,btohqsg
dunno is it UOB problem. i had a xnap transaction that took 7 days to post when it usually takes only 1 day. same thing  the pending transaction disappeared for days. never had this happen with other cards.,btohqsg
interest rate for SA/MA/RA reduced to 4.05% in Q2,btohqsg
Can I ask if anyone knows how to delink bank accounts from Dobin? Just in case I stop using this app,btohqsg
Mac is typically late to post the transaction I noticed  at least 5 days typically,btohqsg
Anyone knows if you link a standard chartered or any other credit card to Apple Pay or google pay to 2 different device and use for SimplyGo. The device was used in 2 different transport trip can both transaction earn card benefit ?,btohqsg
Snack scared we never read. Spam us again with Amex removed,btohqsg
Hmm just realised something similar happened to my Shopee transactions as well.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check what's the best strategy to earn interest for savings above 100k?,btohqsg
from what i realised   shopee and lazada post only when you press order received,btohqsg
split into multiple bank accounts ? like uob   ocbc etc or u already have 100k in each,btohqsg
Ohhh...but the other account only yield 0.05%?,btohqsg
Or is there any other ways? I have both accounts. But mainly in UOB cause of interest.,btohqsg
Uob lady's card if select dining but dining merchat on UOB$ programme. So no UNI$ will be qualify right?,btohqsg
Will not get base points but will get the delayed bonus.,btohqsg
i got this too on Citi,btohqsg
Hi experts  if I have $10k to invest in local bank stocks  should I go for dbs or OCBC or UOB? OCBC is lowest in price which means I can buy more shares but what do u all think ü§î,btohqsg
Can also consider investing into money market funds to earn rates similar to high-interest savings accounts. But will not be SDIC insured,btohqsg
no leh  i have shopee and lazada orders that are still on the way and transactions posted already,btohqsg
SA  RA  MA drop back to 4.05%,btohqsg
i would say DBS  cause DBS biggest in SG,btohqsg
It happens to me. I left $13 to hit $1000 tier by end of today. Don't know why cold storage is so slow to post.,btohqsg
Yup. Depends one... Maybe need to chase them to post it by today cos today is the end of my statement day,btohqsg
Anyone encountering random 10cts deposited into their uob account. I have reported uob and they advised me to make a police report. I make a online report with phyiscal statement from uob  however  the police said is not under their jurisdiction. This is the 5th time am getting 10cts deposited,btohqsg
If police say not their problem. Then ok Liao ah. I will just let the money come my bank account. In sg  if the police not catching u  who else can catch u? üòÇ,btohqsg
