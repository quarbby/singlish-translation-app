Iirc for restaurants NEA is for hygiene and what not AVA is only if you are importing food,btohqsg
"for most of sg's history  food hygiene is maintained by nea and ava.nea because they control most of the hawker establishments  and ava because they monitor food sourcesin 2018 sfa was set up to sort of aggregate the food functions for both but it is still relatively new.the first ""A"" in ava is agricultural  i.e. the cultivation of food source. so... yes i think you did not remember correctly xD",btohqsg

[25/11  5:49 pm] whotfisthis: Hello there  my name is Ethan from Lynx Analytics. My colleague referred me to you about the freelance job .😃[25/11  5:54 pm] whotfisthis: hey there  how do I address you ?[25/11  6:05 pm] whotfisthis: yeah sure I will send you to have a look first[25/11  6:05 pm] whotfisthis: Job description (JD)--Time- flexible hours  (45min – 1hour daily)-Location – Work from home (WFH)-Complete 40 missions per day = 1 set ( max 120 missions=3 sets)-Each mission ( products with different values)  you will get 1% commission-Average salary per day  >>>   $60-$120,btohqsg
Lol nth we can do about it unless the person is in the group,btohqsg
I got 5 dollar inside my bank,btohqsg
I got 5 dollar inside Sia,btohqsg
How does she know your bank account tho,btohqsg
can give me jia ling telegram ?,btohqsg
How did she get your phone number?,btohqsg
My guess is you accidentally added another scammer as a contact without realising it,btohqsg
Or ur friends kenna hack and ask for ur phone number,btohqsg
I found the tele chat for report,btohqsg
I’m waiting for my bank acc to go empty,btohqsg
Anyways in the future it's best if you report and block right away instead of playing around with the scammer,btohqsg
Just now I couldn’t at all,btohqsg
It also lets telegram admin restrict the account as soon as possible,btohqsg
The moment you reply back to the message the report button disappears,btohqsg
"Basically there will be this button ""block user""  and after clicking it you will see ""report spam""",btohqsg
"But if you reply back to the message  the ""report spam"" option doesn't appear for you  ie. you can block but not report",btohqsg
Hopefully this means they have a harder time messaging people,btohqsg
I mean normal people won't have burner numbers,btohqsg
It's safe to assume that the person behind this is some hikkimori hiding in his basement that you don't know about,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA tyty I think so to,btohqsg
For pro might as well get others,btohqsg
Idk but if you are getting it for the noise cancellation function you might as well get an actual headphone that can do that,btohqsg
If it's just for the wireless I guess an okay worth bah,btohqsg
the person isnt targetting you. the person is targetting ur friends,btohqsg
nothing to gain from u by impersonating you,btohqsg
e.g. u are my close friend and someone called huixin w a profile pic of huixin asks me for 100 dollars urgently for family issues,btohqsg
just give a heads up to your close friends who trust you enough,btohqsg
but all the info you have is... nothing,btohqsg
next time dont so suagu can le haha,btohqsg
I using android we gang gang,btohqsg
ancestor's hear mango's plea to drop out,btohqsg

"i just send whoever come with ads ""who is your boss i 10 years old why i need work so annoying"" 2 days later their account is deactivated",btohqsg
I believe it is quadratic eqn,btohqsg
Dhoby refers to Indian washerman that did laundry in the past  in present day dhoby ghaut.Laundy needs to dry in the sun. That's why it comes before Somerset. 😬,btohqsg
For jc  phy/chem or chem/bio open more doors?,btohqsg
