Yes. Actually they did decline in quality. Full of excuses now. Last time is no excuse work for people.,btohqsg
Didn't PAP's own Vivian say that WP is just like PAP just that WP is one step to the left during the debate?Hmmmm...,btohqsg
I believe the generation back then was the no excuse type,btohqsg
Thankful to LKY and his team then.  Not pap. Just because pap doesn‚Äôt mean standard same.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt mean standard same forever . I don‚Äôt understand why government must force us buy insurance now. Though we already have. $900 a year isn‚Äôt cheap.,btohqsg
And why if got hdb first can have Any amount of private property. A lot ppl have hdb then buy 4-5 private property also can. Then if got private property cannot buy hdb . The rules all v unfair I feel,btohqsg
Ya. Rules should be amended. If u already have hdb  and wants to buy private  should give up ur hdb,btohqsg
Maybe another revenue for the government?,btohqsg
Are there a lot of such pple? With HDB and have ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of Pte Pty?,btohqsg
Yes there are  collecting rentals as passive income for their retirement needs,btohqsg
Ok bro  of course there are but not ‚Äúso many‚Äù lah,btohqsg
Anyway the issue is about pple abusing the HDB scheme.... of everybody one is not an abuse,btohqsg
Yeah u dunno but there are a lot,btohqsg
They stay in hdb and rent out their private property . And get Govt Payout still.,btohqsg
Because it‚Äôs not like hundred thousands la  but already got quite a number. Maybe 1000? As in  I feel rules are unfair.,btohqsg
And one more thing  why is Govt giving 238 million of foreigner to study here every year?,btohqsg
Actually to be frank  I am very worried about my offsprings in future. Even I sent to a lot of enrichments  I feel they won‚Äôt be protected and would not even survive here. Life is really hard  too many bills. Even go Uni debts. Foreigners come here got free Uni education til phd leh  and bond to guarantee them a job. And they still have to compete w foreigners. Sorry just ranting :( nowhere to rant,btohqsg
