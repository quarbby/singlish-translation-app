Also  the hsbc officer told me the $5000 deposit is considered as per transaction (they must see 1 $5000 transaction) so she gave me a scenario  if you put in $5000  then withdraw $2000 after that it‚Äôs still counted for that month,btohqsg
No it‚Äôs not instant  need 1 week to open  and debit card another 2 weeks after,btohqsg
i see okay great thanks for the info,btohqsg
But as long as you apply physically they will manually tell singsaver to include you in promo,btohqsg
So even if account open in mid feb no prob,btohqsg
Any cards still give rewards for paying town council sc&c?,btohqsg
Just curious isnt hsbc advance credit card better? With EGA u are getting 1.5% + 1%   more than 2k spending 2.5% + 1% without the mcc whitelist that hsbc revolution has to adhere to?,btohqsg
Anyone applied for amex tc recently?,btohqsg
with $2k spend might as well go for 5%-10% cashback cards?,btohqsg
Below 2k spending   2.5% cashback is decent enough for most spending without following the mcc whitelist,btohqsg
whatcard.sgfor quick reference. but might not be accurate or comprehensive enough,btohqsg
Is dbs the only one can see via internet banking?,btohqsg

Here's an updateFirst officer  she was helping me on the matter and put me on hold. Unfortunately  the call was disconnected.When I called again  another 2 officers tried to convince me that the decision is final and they don't practice such thing as an appeal. There are so many people who appealed successfully leh,btohqsg
Ooo what did u put as the application nbr then? On the singsaver form. Since it wasnt done online,btohqsg

Did you find out your bonus points from dbs ibanking digibot? The statement points gives the sum of the bonus points for transactions in the calendar month of Dec plus the non-bonus points for the transactions in your Jan statement.,btohqsg
Take note bonus points for FCY online transactions are calculated differently from bonus points for SGD online transactions  but you will still get the same total points for online,btohqsg
Anyone can start the challenge? Don‚Äôt seem to load after starting it,btohqsg
Which would you use for paying Telco bills? (StarHub/SingTel/M1)1. DBS Woman‚Äôs World card2. UOB One Credit Card3. Standard Chartered Spree,btohqsg

Someone mentioned to buy and get the transaction posted then to call bank to check. I did that but my transaction is still pending and not posted so I won‚Äôt be able to know till then.,btohqsg
Hi all  was paying my M1 bill and realised maybe can 1 shot top up 1000 and still get 4mpd on it.. any idea if m1 will just deduct from there every month?,btohqsg
Is this a good example for the difference between online and offline spending?A credit card online is when you use the credit card in an online transaction such as paying for am Amazon transaction. To do this you also use the CVV number on the back of the card as well as quoting the card number and name on it.A credit card offline is when you go into a shop and pay for something using your credit card. The credit card can be used contactless if the transaction value is low enough. Neither name or CVV are checked since you are there with it.,btohqsg
Hmm why pay in advance when you can pay the outstanding bill amount every month? Leaving this money inside is a lost opportunity to invest this amount somewhere else,btohqsg
For UOB One  u can try Sheng Siong or SPC Petrol.,btohqsg
