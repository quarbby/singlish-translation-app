yes  should be only one working day,btohqsg
Anyone knows what‚Äôs the best card for overseas usage to accumulate points/miles?,btohqsg
Ooh! Okay. I sign up so long already I forgot.,btohqsg
Instarem amaze with dbs wwmc (till 31 may) and CRMC,btohqsg
Can let me know where is the payment tab  I can‚Äôt find at my side,btohqsg
As a student  should i use grab card for points or should i get a student credit card?,btohqsg
Or you just try to make a transfer to your own bank account and you will be promoted,btohqsg
I scroll all the way down cannot see payment LOL,btohqsg
To earn the revolut invite referral fee  it seems like in item 3 mentioned connecting another bank account or using bank account.Top up from grabpay will not be eligible since it is not a ‚Äúbank‚Äù?,btohqsg
Maybe you can make a transfer to your own bank account first,btohqsg
Take bus 20% off(Max 10$ only) and top up crypto app card,btohqsg
The yearly limit 30k does not seem enough too. So trying to find another e-wallet as a backup üò¨,btohqsg
Or other than UOB Absolute and Amex True CB card  are there any Visa or Master card that give Cashback for e-wallet top up?,btohqsg
Experienced this  but the transactions were the same transaction with different amounts. Just had to perform a transaction elsewhere then it worked already.,btohqsg
The limit is 5k daily  10k monthly and 30k yearly if I‚Äôm not wrong.,btohqsg
I think someone will only do this if you might hit the maximum spending of GPMC.If not the usual method is to use AMEX to top grab then to revolut.,btohqsg
Yes  most of time I use AMEX and GrabPay to top up Revolut  but for the public transportation cashback  I have to top up from bank account once per month. So this is just to save some troubles from opening bank apps and making manual transfers,btohqsg
Especially if your bank app is buggyü§£,btohqsg
Which card got public transport rebate?,btohqsg
Revolut card has temporary promo 20% capped at $10. SC smart card has 6%. CDC depends on your tier. All these card don‚Äôt have minimum spending.,btohqsg
Thanks! I shall go look at some student credit card,btohqsg
Is it possible to pay for HDB housing loan via SGQR with GrabPay card?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  saw your cardup video. Would like to ask. If my existing payments are alr on GIRO.. do I cancel those arrangements once the cardup arrangement is up?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  for cardup withcrypto.comcard  is the CDC card considered Singapore issued card for promotions under cardup?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if cdc card will work for promotion. If u click into the details of the promotion  it‚Äôs indicated they debit card is not applicable,btohqsg
If anybody tried. Appreciate ur contribution,btohqsg
Promo Code is not valid to be used:(a) with Mastercard  China Unionpay  American Express credit cards and credit cards issued outside of Singapore.(b) with debit/preloaded cards(c) on any additional fees incurred for Next Day payments.(d) in conjunction with any other promotions  offers or discounts.,btohqsg
Uses CDC card with card up for paying,btohqsg
It works. But note : CDC announce a nerf on cashback & limit effective 1st June 2022,btohqsg
Probably app haven't update. 1st jun is for those who stake finished and benefits will end 1 june,btohqsg
Any new stake after 1 may already don't have then10%,btohqsg
CDC is losing too much money,btohqsg
Hello everybody  jus wanna seek ur opinion on signing up credit card to get its freebies.Is it worth it to sign a CC to get a free standing table after spending $500 in 1 month using the CC?Or should I just buy an alternative cheaper standing table from taobao instead?,btohqsg
if you have an upcoming $500 ticket item then why not. but if you finding reason to spend $500 to get the free gift then probably no,btohqsg
What card to use with cArdup after the nerf?,btohqsg
Not only cdc nerf  uob one also nerf for $2000 spend tier lowered to 3.33%,btohqsg
Ya I saw for uob as well. :(,btohqsg
Still  no Better card for cardup.At least ipaymy has ocbc frank,btohqsg
Probably those pure cashback like Citi+ and uob absolute going nerf soon,btohqsg
I think they make quite decent profit. Just they want more profit,btohqsg
They are one of the widest spread around. And charges quite a lot for the fees,btohqsg
with all these nerf  everyone is feeling sad,btohqsg
going to wait for more global YTuber to explain the CDC situation,btohqsg
And guess I'm going to hold back on my UOB One card application,btohqsg
Confirmed unable to link ICBC Travel to Amaze instarem for the 4%. Pity.,btohqsg
If I use Citi+ and I system is 2.6% cb?,btohqsg
So no difference with 500 tier?,btohqsg
I think the one of the concerns about UOB one is that the CB is capped exactly at 3.33% for each tier. You spend $500 a month  your quarterly CB is $50  $1000 is $100  $2000 is $200.But you spend $500 you get $50 a quarter  you spend $999 also get $50. You really need to spend just the right amount to maximise.,btohqsg
But the advantages are no category capped  not like UOB Evol where you have online spending and contactless mobile payment. Good for those who not willing to track which categories.And also the additional CB like Shopee  Grab  Daily Farm & UOB travels. These CB are capped at $100 A MONTH  means you can spend up to $1500.,btohqsg
