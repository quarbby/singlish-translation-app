how tf r u this clueless,btohqsg
i learnt in gp lesson that too much pride and self love is not a good thinf,btohqsg
They jus wan people to say “wow u did a goodjob” coz he is surrounded by 90rp friends,btohqsg
Similar to those people on sgfi asking how to survive when they earn $20k per month,btohqsg
i give them benefit of doubt cause maybe all their friends >85rp,btohqsg
but then at most 83.75 would be mid but i dont think it would be bad by any standards,btohqsg
Is it my math or…how can y = sth hv any roots,btohqsg
hi i need help with this qn,btohqsg
if u cant answer it we cant either😬,btohqsg
from his/her score  an increase in like 1-2rp allows him/her to go into more courses,btohqsg
and not like 1 to 2 but like 5 more,btohqsg
Like f(x) = m basically y = sth (a horizontal line),btohqsg
Maybe my english standard can’t understand the qns,btohqsg
I think is when f(x) = wtv value,btohqsg
Im confused coz the qns say f(c) = m (which is a horizontal line),btohqsg
So im not even sure if im understanding things right,btohqsg
Tbh those ppl who say things abt cca (like my parents and how i cant cope in band)  dun they know cca step down is real early,btohqsg
But i mean u cant start fr 0 la,btohqsg
iinw its the no. of time the line y=m intersects the curve,btohqsg
I actually tbh think it is hard to fail,btohqsg
Unless u really really didnt put in effort,btohqsg
no. of intersections btwn line and the curve,btohqsg
I was thinking why f(x) = m  horizontal line how to freaking get roots,btohqsg
Isit nvr do math in a while,btohqsg
Actually i didn’t understand one of my A levels math stats qns,btohqsg
(i havent done math in years 💀💀,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorya yi is legit teaching us saqs in gp lolol,btohqsg
i was abt to say did u not listen in class,btohqsg
My english is real shit lmao,btohqsg
idw to retake as or retain j1,btohqsg
I can’t understand math english lmao,btohqsg
i know that coefficient is the number in front of the x,btohqsg
i just super lost at the vertical asymptote part.. what am i doing wrong pls help 😭😭,btohqsg
Vertical asymptote is when denominator = 0,btohqsg
He think its not enough coz prob his social circle is those bungalow kind,btohqsg
Denominator of fraction cannot be 0 becauseanything/0 is undefined. So in this case  ur vertical asymptote is -2  meaning that the graph you draw will never touch the line x=-2. If you sub x=-2 into ur graph  you also wont be able to get any answer.In order to find c you need to let x + c = 0. And you sub x=-2 into x + c = 0,btohqsg
why they put it up like its such a flex😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
maybe coz it is a norm,btohqsg
yi house logo name colour anf cheer is literally aids,btohqsg
