hey guys my mum wanna pump $ into an online start-up  like online tuition. do u think there is demand if the prices are really cheap like $20/hr? possible investment capital in the range of $50-100k - mostly for advertisements and software solutions,btohqsg
"""Cheap"" prices are an ambiguity to begin with",btohqsg
@chemcertwo timing with the phone numbers ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
One in the US one in SG,btohqsg
whats the ROI and projected breakeven date,btohqsg
Then do u know of any other companies which are in this field? Can just invest money into them?,btohqsg
Or this business model generally not promising?,btohqsg
depends how you structure it  but sounds very risky imo,btohqsg
i would help you do calcs but im too lazy,btohqsg
they got a few millions from VCs,btohqsg
What if investment amt is $10k? Higher ROI then,btohqsg
but their tech is quite fluff,btohqsg
Is it like valuation financial modelling kind of stuff,btohqsg
You investment banking or private equity ah,btohqsg
nope but i went for an intro course on it,btohqsg
anyway your mum is better off putting the money with her own private relationship manager,btohqsg
those guysâ€™ jobs are wealth management so they will help you invest it appropriately  dont even need to think much,btohqsg
and for the record  most startups fail. unicorns startups are rare as the name suggests  you probably will have more ROI in the casino unless you know what youâ€™re doing esp about the industry,btohqsg
what's wrong with the business model though?,btohqsg
and if the business model is bad  then why VC put millions into geniebook. and where did u get the figure from about geniebook? o.o,btohqsg
yes i know  within 10 yrs,btohqsg
nothing wrong with the business model,btohqsg
the tech is not that hard,btohqsg
but they use a lot of big words,btohqsg
oh then u said it is not very promising,btohqsg
referring to the online tuition thing u mentioned earlier,btohqsg
oh u mean it is not as promising as solutions like geniebook,btohqsg
no i just mean not as promising in general,btohqsg
so u think recorded + more tech-based lessons are more promising in terms of ROI,btohqsg
if its zoom tuitions  people are alr doing that  if its a software then a lot of courseware exist alrrady,btohqsg
recorded stuff is available everywhere  people even do it for free,btohqsg
so u are saying geniebook is over-valued and does not have a good model?,btohqsg
if what u say about the millions of $ is true.,btohqsg
