Is it better to buy own filter n oil for servicing? I heard workshop use cheap filter n the oil they use donno from where,btohqsg
Ya. They use coffee filter n olive oil,btohqsg
Isn’t it more expensive? I know u want to act Dao but ur examples kind of stupid. Lmao,btohqsg
up to u bro but since its SG context  service every 6 months using cheap oil and filter OK la  not like you service every 1 year,btohqsg
"unless u go up and down JB very often or clock many km per month (maybe u do sales or PHV for example)  no point servicing using the ""best"" oil + ""best"" filter",btohqsg
U don’t feel swindled if they use cheap filter n oil?,btohqsg

arbo u go ask the car workshop to rent you their space for $10 an hour see how long u service...,btohqsg
I saw the workshop use those cheap oem china filter 20 cent kind,btohqsg
OEM china filter can buy at 20 cents let me know sia  shopee selling $5,btohqsg
Then the oil they use don’t know from leftover from where 1,btohqsg

If I buy myself I know right,btohqsg
bulk EO is sold by the barrel  whether got markings or not is entirely up to the manufacturer,btohqsg
