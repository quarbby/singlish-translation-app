I am using tiger trade btw,btohqsg
not so fast can withdraw. takes about 1-3 working days before u can withdraw the money,btohqsg
Need 2 working days to be available for withdrawal.,btohqsg
Oh thank u!! I tot what happen my money gone,btohqsg
That’s a great feat!Happy lunar new year!!🧧U may wanna start on some long term investments  simple ETFThen use some to do short term high yield savings account then some u can continue to trade as u have been consistent,btohqsg
Does anyone know if private dental clinics (eg Q&M) is usually in credit card exclusion list?,btohqsg
usually not excluded. Uob absolute amex is one of the rare ones that exclude.,btohqsg
Thank you  happy new year to you too.I'm holding some STI ETF for now. I also have a very small amount of money in syfe for S&P500. For the short term high yield savings account you mentioned  is that with the bank?,btohqsg
The one I go to earns on Amaze+CRMC.,btohqsg
Actually we all want to learn from you how do achieve $380k saving at the age of 25 without diploma and no stable income. 😄.,btohqsg
If you already trade to 300k networth. Why you seek advice? You shld already know what to do yourself. Just trust your heart  continue what you doing.,btohqsg
I didnt make the full 300k from trading  i only made about 20k so far. Also friends have been saying timing the market is not a good way to trade. I need a more sustainable and long term approach.,btohqsg
70k is inheritance  saved up about 130k from working etc. And bulk of the rest is from 🎰💀,btohqsg
90% of the part time jobs i've worked is cash only no cpf also.,btohqsg
Oic. First thing you need to do is to preserve your saving. Look for stable investment/saving  such as high interest bank saving accounts(4%-4.65%. Req $500 spend on CC monthly and salary credit) n SG government bond eg. Tbill 3%. Look for a stable job that has CPF contributions.  Then consider only park small portion in trading.,btohqsg
So i'll probably need a full time job first since i can't get a CC without proper income then. I did put $100k in SSB previously but i feel the interest too less for 10 year period,btohqsg
See yourself lor. I will say don't need to seek advice from people. People advice can be wrong too. Just use it as a reference.It is your life. You decide yourself. Test out more things on what you suitable and like for.,btohqsg
The best non investment advice I can provide is to always apply for HDB BTO as early and as soon as you can.For investment advice it is probably not appropriate to give any in a public forum other than say everyone has different risk profile and investment needs. Seek a licenced professional advice but beware of hefty commissions. Many of us are doing own self directed cheap investments but you must know what u are doing.,btohqsg
Understood thank you  cant bto if i'm single tho 🥲 I've been doing everything myself because i don't wanna pay the comms also,btohqsg
Second non investment advice (in my humble opinion)  a great complimentary life partner is the other best “asset” you can have to each other.,btohqsg
This one q tough  still working on it. Not that i'm picky but most i've dated are too materialistic or not driven enough in life. Also don't match my life goals,btohqsg
Hi guys  need advise. Booking hotel via Agoda have an option to pay now or pay at later date. If we choose to pay at later date  does that consider clocking as Jan or March spending in this case?,btohqsg
A general investment technique which u are probably familiar with and many of us do is Dollar Cost Averaging.Pick an asset you like and have researched about  then buy a fixed amount of it every month without bothering about price movements.,btohqsg
I'm currently doing that for Syfe  not trading individual stock for US market because i don't know enough or volatility is too much for me. V slow so far because i only got about $2k in syfe,btohqsg
Counts towards the month when the transaction is charged.,btohqsg
Hi All  just to get confirmed  is Maybank Barcelona card gives treats points only for foreign currency spend? And the local payment will have 1.6% cashback? Also does the local spend for 1.6% is it necessary to be block of $5?,btohqsg
Take note the difference in the amount can be quite substantial from the price you see now. Read agoda’s T&C,btohqsg
That will be 4.90% interest per year?,btohqsg
4% plus (cash bonus / 150 000) / 2Since I treat it as 6 month lock in. This is a conservative calculation.,btohqsg
