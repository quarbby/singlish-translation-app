Hi üëã folks. New in this chat but watching HMSG from long time now. I switched to mile chasing last year with HSBC Revo and nerfed  just got Crmc+amaze and immediately neefed. I have started to think that mile chasing has become a high spenders game. Also  since new cashback cards coming in from everywhere  is it really a good idea to switch to cashback chasing?,btohqsg
Have u guys heard about the nerf news on amaze?,btohqsg
No haven‚Äôt heard. Just read everywhere.,btohqsg
Hi All just a noob question. For childcare if I tie account deduction to be in chocolate account. It wouldn't earn 2MM right? Must be from the card itself,btohqsg
DBS offers 25000 points to offset 350 SGD on credit card bill.Is this a good deal?ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
350/(2√ó25000) = 0.7 cents per mile value only  not worth,btohqsg
Hi  js to check Transport using cf also can get 2mpd right?,btohqsg
Hi all can I confirm on my UOB pot of gold registration:28Feb: sign up on PoG registration form28Feb: deposit 150K29Mar: funds will be earmarkedSo from 1Mar onwards  I can get the bonus interest  with $500 card spend + $1600 salary (edited) in March  correct?,btohqsg
You still need salary crediting in Mar for the bonus interest.How much was your MAB in Dec? Or simply put  is your account in Dec at $0 for the whole month?,btohqsg
Oh yes thanks  I‚Äôve edited my post to include salary. Actually I‚Äôm doing this for my mom. Just applied UOB one acct for her this morning online üòÖ she has about $3k+ sitting in UOB uniplus account . That counts into MAB ya?,btohqsg
Should I then deposit $155K instead? To take into account the 3k+ sitting in her uniplus account?,btohqsg
For uob ppv  to get 4mpd i just need to use mobile contactless for offline payment right? Means just use apple pay will allow me in getting the bonus point?,btohqsg
If scared then put 155k.. assuming she will touch the amounts in her UOB Uniplus account but not in the UOB One account.,btohqsg
Ok thanks alot for your help! So it‚Äôs safe to register today and start earning the bonus interest from 1March onwards with all criteria met.,btohqsg
