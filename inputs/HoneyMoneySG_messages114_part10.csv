Food with revo is dangerous and it doesn’t cover fast food under 5814 mcc anymore,btohqsg
Any card to suggest? As I was using hsbc before the nerf  so thinking of continuing cause I have existing points in the card. But happy to switch to another card if the benefits exceeds Revo.,btohqsg
If you want to utilise UOB Stash account for the next promo  you can opt to deposit and register fresh funds of 100k (not 150k). This will still yield you 3.51% p.a. if you do not take out the 1k you left in the account.Take note these numbers are based off the current promo and it may be reduced/increased at the mercy of UOB.,btohqsg
Think amaze + citi rewards should be better compare to revo based on your listed spendings,btohqsg
You mean hsbc and Citi also can remit out usd totally free. Or u meant scb can send to hsbc and Citi free?,btohqsg
Now with xnap not working  os grab wallet with amex cc top up the next best option if shops dont accept cc directly,btohqsg
It's one of the methods  but note that you'll have orphan money inside if you don't spend at least $10.,btohqsg
Noted that its one of the methods. Whats the best method for ppl in cashback camp,btohqsg
Hi all  will like to check: I got a Tbill (bought with OA) maturing this month. I also plan to continue to use this amount for this month's Tbill. Can I use the proceeds in the CPFIA for that? Or do i need to transfer back to OA? Thank you !!,btohqsg
no need to transfer back to OA  the CPFIA can be used right away to buy new t Bill,btohqsg
Hi  I am curious to know what bank/insituition converts USD-> SGD at  USD 2 spot rate. Was it HSBC or SCB or IBKR?,btohqsg
Can transfer money from bank n combine it with non-transferable money  use all the non transferable money n left with transferable money  then transfer the orphan money back to bank?,btohqsg
AMEX Pay with AMEX-issued cards works too.,btohqsg
Question is  will they use the transferable or non-transferable monies first? 🤪,btohqsg
For me  signed up AMEX TCB. 3% for 6mths for using AMEX pay,btohqsg
Nice will read up more on this,btohqsg
Last time I used Grabpay  Grab rules is using non-transferable first on your purchase. Not sure any change after that.,btohqsg
If you use GrabPay often  then orphan monies won't impact you. But if you don't use GrabPay often  you still need to find another use case for the orphan monies before topping up to spend and withdraw the transferable balance also. 🙃,btohqsg
If you’re topping up via Amex cc  you can just use Amex pay tho? Why risk yourself for orphan cash,btohqsg
Maybe he meant UOB Absolute cashback?,btohqsg
Morning  would anyone have any promo code for house cleaning services? Moving out and need a 1-2hr of the unit.,btohqsg

Is this for new to bank customer or new to card is applicable too? 🙂,btohqsg
New to bank only  revised my writing,btohqsg
Yes i am on uob absolute amex,btohqsg
OCBC360 changing policy again?Back in April.I got Saving Bonus  Salary Bonus  CC bonus.in May I withdrew money for investment.in June  I maintain May amount +$1000 addition.Now  i got only Salary bonus + CC Bonus.Any idea?,btohqsg
"What is the min period to be considered ""new to bank"". I cancelled citi cc abt 1yr ago",btohqsg
Prob ur average balance increase is less than 500,btohqsg
As per advice here  I withdraw and remain additional +$1000 from previous amount,btohqsg
You only put in June then you will get interest for save in july. This month interest is for may mab.,btohqsg
Today is only 11 Jun. Bonus for saving in Jun will be released in 8/9 July.,btohqsg
guys  if wanan pay school fee  which card to use is best?,btohqsg
June haven't pass ... Your may dropped below Apr ... So no save,btohqsg
Check the MAB online instead of using deposit as a guide.,btohqsg
Yup agreed my deposit and MAB has a large difference,btohqsg
Not the immediate one. Must buy the 2 week later one,btohqsg
U can rely 100% on amaze mcc but u cannot rely on amaze category classification.,btohqsg
I mean HSBC can send USD out free and Interactive Brokers USD uses Citi NA,btohqsg
Jun haven't end lol. And May you withdrew money so no Save.,btohqsg
Maybe you should read the website and its written in the message you replied to as well,btohqsg
Oh this one I didn’t know. Thanks for sharingI only knew scb and Dbs can send out usd free with certain conditions met.Ps. Is your ibkr sg or IBKR us. I’m pretty sure I didn’t send to Citibank na.,btohqsg
I send to citibank na on ibkr also. Dbs remit is free  i dont remember any conditions. Only when i receive they charge a fee. Given that the vast majority of my net worth is in USD  i transfer v often so it adds up.,btohqsg
"Habe you tried searching ""school fee card""?",btohqsg
Hmmm. Weird. But I’m very old customer. Over 10 years.,btohqsg
any tips where to exchange and top up rmb in wechat pay/alipay at singapore,btohqsg
My account was started at 2006 i think. JPm  isn’t that just the agent bank? I know when we do SG fast transfer to ibkr  i also transfer to Citi.,btohqsg
Sgd and usd different lehJp Morgan is the final custodian bank for my usd,btohqsg
I am saying whether i transfer usd or sgd  its still to citi.,btohqsg
what happens when you create a new deposit instruction?,btohqsg
Suspect they have different banks for different batch of customers.All of us are correct.,btohqsg
