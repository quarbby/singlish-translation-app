The m qn is d same as 2018,btohqsg
Thought the root 3 is somewhere on top or maybe I rmb wrongly,btohqsg
Did you sub your answer with a random value of x to see if itâ€™s the same as the given eqn,btohqsg
If so  u must throw  cannot keep.,btohqsg
I think I got a slightly different answer and when I sub back in got the exact same,btohqsg
were we supposed to find k,btohqsg
i left everyth in terms of k lmao dead,btohqsg
wlao that qn i fking dumb,btohqsg
U hv to use value of b,btohqsg
Wonder whatâ€™s the grade threshold for A1,btohqsg
why the 2nd part for q1 is emath?,btohqsg
LOL same I left the last 6 marks blank tho Iâ€™m confident of the rest of my ans,btohqsg
i was contemplating on e funct but the ans weird af,btohqsg
u also cld hv manually calculator,btohqsg
bruh i fcked up all my papers LMAO,btohqsg
HAHAHA AT FIRST I CALCULATE ONE BY ONE SIA,btohqsg
huh u alr took it issit,btohqsg
then like left 1 min i hurry cancel everyt then i do compound interest,btohqsg
i almost no time finish ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My kinematics I messed up on accident,btohqsg
how do get tanA = 1/3 sia dead,btohqsg
wlao last qn i sudd forgot how to do trigo,btohqsg
Plus I have 30min to Chelsea shit,btohqsg
I got some reason forgot how to do those sort of trigo questions cos never revise hais,btohqsg
I could do all trigo but i decided to fuck my alpha beta marks,btohqsg
Whats ur ans for part b,btohqsg
Is b greater than a or smaller,btohqsg
But I managed to guess cos(A-B) is 4/5,btohqsg
U need sub in everything they give u,btohqsg
Shit if I say quadraple root 4 is instead of root 2 would marks be minus,btohqsg
gg la i got like A = 2/5 or smth,btohqsg
Iâ€™m guessing they might minus 1 :/,btohqsg
For Q1 if I left it as one for coefficient x^2 instead of making everything whole number should be ok right,btohqsg
Paper 2 should have the clt question,btohqsg
So should be upon around 92-95,btohqsg
You said 1/4+something for the area so isnâ€™t ur that one wrong,btohqsg
I roughly rmb getting 1/2 plus something with the fraction and pi,btohqsg
I forgot to change it to surds pls send help,btohqsg
Wait that one need modulus? When I enter everything inside the calculator I got a positive number,btohqsg
for the kinematics qn part b  if i found k but my distance is wrong then how many marks?,btohqsg
last q last part i tot is find B,btohqsg
Yo dis paper is only 44% apparently,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure paper 2 will be harder,btohqsg
Cause the first paper not too tough,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s d invite link to dis grp btw,btohqsg
for me I was able to do everything (not sure about my m answer) plus part of the trigo qn so if harder I might not be able to do more,btohqsg
anyone have pdf version of paper?,btohqsg
Humanities is it true that the grade threshold for A1 is very Low since a lot people donâ€™t tend to do very well for it?,btohqsg
I heard itâ€™s only 70 plus,btohqsg
2020 4E5N 4047 A Math P1.pdf,btohqsg
