There was once in the middle of the paper I got giddy,btohqsg
And swear that u are just stupid not committing fraud,btohqsg
Luckily I had x oil on my table,btohqsg
Why is safekeeping ic so difficult,btohqsg
Usually I know it will come if I start feeling lightheaded,btohqsg
It has been in one place and I dun really take it out coz I usually use SingPass,btohqsg
Sometimes I can predict it so I put a bit of oil first,btohqsg
Not rlly la just some ppl forgetful lor,btohqsg
Coz have u heard of medication overuse headache,btohqsg
Ok la but I dun think I will even come close to that extreme coz I dun eat naproxen / Nurofen EOD basis,btohqsg
Use sparingly basically. But abortive medications don't work by reducing pain,btohqsg
In fact it doesn't do shit for that it just limits the extent,btohqsg
But I dun want to also be resistant to NSAIDs  my headache already resistant to Panadol,btohqsg
Then another one in 2h if dun help,btohqsg
Cuz its vasoconstriction for abortive medication,btohqsg
No la if u do a proper pain workup usually they will attempt to lower your BP,btohqsg
And then migraines are mainly cause by vasodilation of your brains bloodvessels so the abortive medication does the opposite lor,btohqsg
Bruh I can‚Äôt have any more lower bp,btohqsg
If still got pain then take painkillers if needed,btohqsg
Then they might put you on medication to increase it,btohqsg
I usually use x oil first,btohqsg
Too low is not good too high not good depends on which side u on either ways not good,btohqsg
If it is really bad then i take nurofen / naproxen,btohqsg
But idk if it is frequent i should go and visit a doctor and not be on painkillers all the time,btohqsg
U won't tho not ideal to do so anyways its more on managing the root cause.,btohqsg
Which most of the time is BP,btohqsg
Ah is it  coz headache has 10001 reasonsüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
That's the trigger reason but physically and structurally it's just blood flow,btohqsg
From a purely physicalist perspective its just oh not normal make it normal  that should make it ok,btohqsg
Anyone have a list of electives with open slots?,btohqsg
