cashback means credit into the credit card. in the statement you will see a positive +$228 transaction,btohqsg

hello all the master here  I have an upcoming 2k bill in a restaurant within the hotel. Which is the best miles card to make such a payment?Seems like all the 4mpd card has a 1k cap so doesnt really make sense.but if i make payment using those 1.1-1.2 mpd card  i will still be better over paying using the 4mpd card and wasting the extra 1k.eg:4 * 1000 = 4000 miles (with 1k not getting any miles)1.2 * 2000 = 2400 miles,btohqsg
Can ask the restaurant to allow you to make payment in two statement months? eg. $1k per month.,btohqsg
Use uob woman card or dbs woman,btohqsg
Any fees if transfer usd from tigr to dbs?,btohqsg
You do get miles after the 1000 mark... usually 0.4mpd üòÇIdeally you will want to split the transaction if possible,btohqsg
I don't think DBS Woman can earn 4mpd in the hotel.,btohqsg
DBS woman is not okay for physical restaurants payment  unless through Kris+,btohqsg
Is this in SG?I just did using Krispay tied to DBS Womans,btohqsg

Hi all  I would like to ask something about OCBC NXT card  since the card will automatically split your bill to either 3 or 6 months interest free installment  will the amount I paid for my monthly installment be considered as eligible card spend for OCBC 360 account? Thanks,btohqsg
Its weird but mine doesnt have the paywave logo,btohqsg
Have been observing this Anh kept giving false advise.. so many times. He/she has to stop giving advise if unsure,btohqsg
if you are referring to the installment based on the auto split from the card (eg $600 split into $200 per month) then that should qualify since its the nature of the cardif you meant paying installment on top of the installment  then no.,btohqsg
Any card best for pay tuition fees installment in Kaplan?,btohqsg

Visa/Mastercard/AMEX cards (including 0% interest instalment by DBS Bank/OCBC Bank/UOB/Maybank/Standard Chartered)If you are using instalments by bank  i think instalments will not have points/cashback.,btohqsg

Currently using dbs vantage which is 1.5mpd I think the highest on the market is 1.6 which but it belongs to premier banking or sort of,btohqsg
I see. how about for cashback credit card  is there any worthy to be used with cardup?,btohqsg
Not very good with cashback personally   but normally high cashback have a cap which doesn‚Äôt go well with big ticket purchases. And general cashback no cap have too low % ( Citibank cashback plus ),btohqsg
UOB VS just nice 2k cap for all contactless,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt have the arches by the side? Have you tried tapping it to pay before? Maybe it‚Äôs a printing error?,btohqsg
