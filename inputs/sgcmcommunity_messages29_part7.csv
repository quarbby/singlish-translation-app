Anyone using the TTC spring buffer? Is it worth it to get?,btohqsg
I'm using. If suspension healthy ok.If absorber spoil.And bouncy. Put also no use.Depend what you are looking for.The reduce of bouncy-ness is not big difference.Just that full pax loaded won't hit hump compare without it.,btohqsg
Big bore throttle body better ba😂,btohqsg
If you wanna reduce rocky boat experience when crossing hump. Or better cornering feels.Must Change absorber.,btohqsg
Is there any maintenance to the spring buffer,btohqsg
Nope.  Mine is about 4-5 yrs. Start to see 1 crack.  It's silicone.,btohqsg
