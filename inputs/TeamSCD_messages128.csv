If i have extra cash lying around i dont mind,btohqsg
Before i change car i can kart every week,btohqsg
Ur car can be ur kart liao,btohqsg
Got my car wrapped alr yay,btohqsg
that one need pay a first time membership fee or something right,btohqsg
I wonder how many ppl even notice the sign let alone respect it,btohqsg
hahahaha i think is ppl go there take photos so much until they put the sign,btohqsg
Unless ppl come in office hours disrupt normal usage,btohqsg
yeah i rmb something like that,btohqsg
ikr? and they are being paid with CP fees,btohqsg
So all the more they should monopolised it and let ppl take photos,btohqsg
niceee  i havent drive a race kart before,btohqsg
I have a race kart lying around in my office,btohqsg
i can take a photo when i go for lunch,btohqsg
but yeah always say wanna take it go run  also lazy,btohqsg
Got a few group went up for pics then left a lot of litter + skid marks,btohqsg
I not very keen tho. I find karting arena their tracks not so nice,btohqsg
Kranji's track is amazing cos it's herrman tilke,btohqsg
the current track by karting arena also bad,btohqsg
i havent try it at kranji yet,btohqsg
I wanna try do donuts somewhere too.,btohqsg
what i really hate about tracks is no run off area,btohqsg
it's as good as a street circuit,btohqsg
Doesnt that depend on which track,btohqsg
So karting arena likes to do this,btohqsg
the RUD in Johor also the same,btohqsg
they put tyres at the sides as barriers with no run offs.,btohqsg
I wanna do with my car,btohqsg
go try and share some gd reviews,btohqsg
But i recommend coming to racetech instead,btohqsg
bcv1 bcbr r.logic k-sport many many brands lol,btohqsg
I saw him he gave me a death stareüòÇ,btohqsg
Hahaha cause I doing delivery then I look at that car then just nice he come out üòÇ,btohqsg
He never whip his dingdong chase you away ah ?,btohqsg
But if u need just for daily driver can use ksport,btohqsg
u go Racing Technik Exhaust Specialist?,btohqsg
Hahahaha he busy see other ding-dong ley,btohqsg
This shop not bad exaust specialist,btohqsg
LOL when i flip the pages,btohqsg
Wtf i didnt even know lolss,btohqsg
Oh. Received the bonnet back already ah,btohqsg
"""Promised 1 week  got back after 4."" right@PilotAviator21",btohqsg
Ensures that the best quality is provided. LOL,btohqsg
Omg take careHow many months pregnant,btohqsg
This one go Genting sure lost,btohqsg
Lucky is a imported unit not registered on sg yet,btohqsg
Anyone know anyone do rim fix,btohqsg
Because got car hit it until very deep in,btohqsg
Just need to know go where and do,btohqsg
If anyone knows how to do it let me know,btohqsg
Any recommendations to do this ?,btohqsg
they will generally know how to fix rims,btohqsg
but the problem is the dent how deep,btohqsg
Or u can try ask Jackie from the tyre terminal,btohqsg
You won't want to compromise on safety,btohqsg
Whole rim need to respray  touch up colour uneven liao lo,btohqsg
Check for hairline cracks have anot,btohqsg
I recommend just change new rim,btohqsg
and they say original rim very strong one?,btohqsg
maybe if that is a replica will be broken already?,btohqsg
those that keep say original damn zai  like macham bulletproof liddat,btohqsg
Apparently is the alloy mixture more zai,btohqsg
Original forged rims dun mean they are impact proofüòÅ,btohqsg
but in this case  the 1 piece liddat = 1 set of replicas liao,btohqsg
no la  volk racing then that price,btohqsg
Rays gram lights not so ex,btohqsg
Depend on rim size I think,btohqsg
should be around 400-600 per piece,btohqsg
only Rays Volk Racing almost 1k per piece,btohqsg
advan also around 1k per piece,btohqsg
what size rims you running on now,btohqsg
Actually hor. How long can original forged rims last ah?,btohqsg
as long as it doesnt rust  or kena whack  can last forever,btohqsg
Haha okay I wonder my rims hw long ago alr,btohqsg
Our forged wheels average $7xx per wheel in 19' for any Monoblock design you want. Lead time is currently at 2 months.With our one-price-for-any-design approach  we also offer an unlimited wheel design recommendation   and vehicular visualization service   to help you see how different designs look on your car.,btohqsg
i found this..they custom made for 19 inch is 700 per piece,btohqsg
We offer high performance FORGED wheels custom-built from 6061-T6 aerospace-grade forged aluminum to any desired design and spec.,btohqsg
Esp when u see the tag,btohqsg
Lolx..I take my chances with established brandsüòÇ,btohqsg
i know just open to saw their advertisement so see see look look,btohqsg
Want customised forged rims  come find me la. RRT Forged. Made in SG,btohqsg
But respray Liao will have 1 rim different shade of colour with the 3 others,btohqsg
Outside spray work wun ever be the same shade as the original finishing from factory,btohqsg
My caliper hot also never change color or burn etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
