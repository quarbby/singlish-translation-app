anything over a stove i cannot make it lol,btohqsg
so if i attempt to cook  is don't need skill  just time and temperature,btohqsg
salt bake fish  cheap and easy to do,btohqsg
but the first fish is to test temperature  2nd one usually better,btohqsg

I havent tried the new one yet. Enjoying gunlance too much,btohqsg
Have a literal “let go everything” skill,btohqsg
i tried to like other weapons but always go back to the long sword,btohqsg
Long sword was OP in part 1,btohqsg
They gave other weapons a fighting chance now,btohqsg
the problem is finding a gunner,btohqsg
gunner's are essential but you can't really solo,btohqsg
Long sword easiest to solo but u have to focus up for 15 minutes,btohqsg
in the older version i loved the valstrax armour,btohqsg
haha the long sword is white all the way,btohqsg
Now got purple liao. The valstrax doesnt go purple i find it morally wrong,btohqsg
