When can a car driver stack 10 jobs???,btohqsg
I just dun see it possibe,btohqsg
In an ideal world i hope they give u all the jobs n u the first to choose wat job u want,btohqsg
Obviously the customer mostly cheapskate chose motorcycles as option then cars when their items r alot,btohqsg
Then all working want job so take  wat to do? But to say car stack 10 jobs is just damn knn,btohqsg
No wat im trying to say is dun push blame on others when u cant get the order  finger not fast enough then maybe should stop playing with urself so ur hand wont shake so much,btohqsg
Well played la. From 11:30 till now havent do any job. Open one then people take liao.,btohqsg

Reach pickup point if you think you can carry and deliver go ahead if not on the spot reject ask them cancel simple. Don't waste time,btohqsg
This one no see before üòÜ,btohqsg
If they didn't pick up you can call Cs and cancel it. But if you there liao dun wan waste fuel just do it. But up to individual la.,btohqsg
Yes usually I do only no matter what no complain one. But this up to individual. My mindset to get as many order as possible. Too many ding dong just waste my time.,btohqsg
They up the price to 18,btohqsg
Ok confirmed paid the amount they say,btohqsg

Lalamove is handling your delivery! You can track its real-time location here:https://share.lalamove.com/?SG100210317161914323310010081693764&lang=en_sg&version=2,btohqsg

That time more than 24hrs I file police record liao,btohqsg
Lala only can call and remind customer to pay nia,btohqsg
I wait until day 4 totally lost my patience this morning online report police . keep chasing Emma like I'm a ah long like that . At last can get back money heng ah,btohqsg
She stay private house leh still play this time of game,btohqsg
She stay private house thats why liddat ü§£She dont see whats the big deal to wait few days,btohqsg
"Exactly. They will make it sound like they have a specialised ""team"" to ""investigate""  cso even assure me can get money3 days later call me ask me make police report myself cos customer uncontactable üôÑ",btohqsg
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if contactable for what i need them to help me chase zzz,btohqsg

Sianz kanna accident on the job,btohqsg
Time wasted gg to idac n stuffs,btohqsg
Waa be safe hopefully all is ok,btohqsg
Customer charge this sofa as 1.7m job,btohqsg
Call CS they will unassigned job to other,btohqsg
I try before got car breakdown at little India then unassigned to me   some more cash order   but I can‚Äôt get cash then CS Transfer to my wallet,btohqsg
Pick up at little India road side,btohqsg
Seems to be the new strategy. Call CS for wrong address or logged waiting  they will cancel the job without compensation. Asking us to suck it up,btohqsg
I called the customer they verified not them who cancel,btohqsg
They cancel then send u again,btohqsg
Forget to tell u guysThe owner lives in sentosa cove,btohqsg
But want to rip us off,btohqsg
Waited 3 hours a few times dunt hav leh,btohqsg
they just reset my rating to 5.0.,btohqsg
I had proof of the wrong address in the receipt vs the one in the lalamove app that I followed resulting in delayed delivery n poor rating. No reset is rating üò¢,btohqsg
my poor rating was given exactly 3 weeks ago (25feb) so maybe 3 week reset cycle?,btohqsg
Based on last 40 orders  means your last 40 all perfect scoreAnd finally got that bad rating out of the system,btohqsg
except that between 25feb and today i only did 5 orders total. checked with balance details.,btohqsg
haha have $19.59 stuck in my balance cannot take out bcoz minimum is $20. trying out airasia this month so din do much llm.,btohqsg
AA uses Teleport  a courier service that is similar to lalamove. riders pick jobs instead of being assigned  like grabpandaroo. can say teleport n llm are direct competitors  except teleport is heavily supporting airasia food right now. Teleport is staffed from the logistics arm of Airasia.,btohqsg
Food small size but fare si beh jialat,btohqsg
they have a lot of new small vendors  probably attracted by the low commission (vs the big players). its prob their break-in strategy.,btohqsg
as a courier company  teleport can also pick up roo  panda n grab orders (like what llm is doing) which they might in the future.,btohqsg
Look üëÄ at the fare no mood unless very near or stack order with llm,btohqsg
6 cancellations in 6 months is a permanent ban? bit too strict.,btohqsg
When there‚Äôs a surge of orders. And the app goes into full retard spam mode. Very easy to swipe wrong order,btohqsg
Then need to cancel. Then tio ban. Nbcb. Way to go to retain driver loyalty.,btohqsg
This is base on no valid reason ba,btohqsg
1 hour for $40 not bad,btohqsg
Like that bo hua lo but 1hr $34 not bad,btohqsg
Will take this kind of order any day lol,btohqsg
Isn't 1 hour $30 considered good?,btohqsg
Lol hero I kanna so many times before,btohqsg
How u handle such cases?For that particular oneI canceled and left the sofa lobbyHaha,btohqsg
I usually tell customer to upgrade or I just take pictures send to support. Best is before you load you tell the customer that 1.7 van cannot pick up the load and ask them if they are ok to upgrade.,btohqsg
Yah failed to do thatThey disappeared after load up and refuse to pick my both my calls and cs,btohqsg
The customer will paiseh say ok üëå,btohqsg
But they offered to help me,btohqsg
Usually I got help so I always like to ask the sender if the item one person can carry or not. It‚Äôs a good way to get them to add helper,btohqsg
Waa pick up 1:15 at senoko. Ask me rush to bishan and reach by 1:30. Thought i fly sia,btohqsg
Idiot üòÇ . Because he rush you. You should be very slow . Teach him a lesson,btohqsg
I say u want fast add money,btohqsg
Then she like never mind. Try ur best. Lol,btohqsg
Monk driving audi.... so good life,btohqsg
I delivered stuff to customer location. Now they want add another location. How ah?,btohqsg
Pay cash if u wan privately do,btohqsg
"I notice some of my cancelled orders say ""driver cancelled""  even though customer is the one who call to cancelDont know if it will affect my record when they implement smart matching ü§î",btohqsg
Actually customer end cannot change the vehicle type right after the order is placed.Yesterday I tried to help a customer to change but can't find on the app,btohqsg
Not sure abt new interface  but usually they can do it in appBefore you swipe pick up,btohqsg
I tried very hard to find eh.. bo,btohqsg
Actually just ask the customer to top up in cash to you  you use user app to check price,btohqsg
Then act blur dont deduct 16% comms hee,btohqsg
Everyone is doing this way üòÜ,btohqsg
Round trip usually gt charges one right? Mine dont have sia,btohqsg
Huh? Can like that one meh,btohqsg
Customer say she will pay me tips. Ok la,btohqsg
Hi. Just to check. For those secure area charges  it's not auto insert? Customer need to manually add in?,btohqsg
This kind okThose I kena is like 5 carto ns 6 cartons.... those I sianz,btohqsg
Oh man. Me first time coming to airline road. The person didn't include. And the agent kept leaving the session.,btohqsg
They should add in secure zone $15,btohqsg
They no give then live chat to CS,btohqsg
Best day so far   6 trips $100+ from 10-4pm (1 hour lunch),btohqsg
Wah so fast $100 liao power,btohqsg
U need to stay on the chat cannot move other place,btohqsg
Every time i use live chat ok want leh no problem,btohqsg
Supposed to be auto insert leh,btohqsg
For round trip alsoHow come not auto included,btohqsg
Cos suppose to be 1 way trip. Then reach place  they say add location then add return trip,btohqsg
Then cs add location. But never add return trip money,btohqsg
Common  I had many such cases  cheapo customer. If u reject n complaint  they complaint to LL  best is nego with them for top up.,btohqsg
Drive slow Bro  pointless to rush our life for LL ,btohqsg
To us  we need to bear with all the repairs cost if we were at fault    inflated insurance if we claim against our own  time loss  endanger our life  affecting our own family's financial  etc etcTo LL  well. That is yr own fucking problem....,btohqsg
2 cartoons of raw chicken from Gek Poh KFC to NTU KFC. MPV $21. 1 cartoon alr 65.5kg lol,btohqsg
Tips: how to catch these smokers  always have a weighing scale üòÇ,btohqsg
luggage scale + tape measure. must have.,btohqsg
Based on experience  tape measure pretty useless. Cause according to lala  if it fits  and is within weight limit  no extra charge,btohqsg
I‚Äôve delivered many items that were over the dimensions limit (but still within weight limit) and never gotten upgrade before.,btohqsg
Always been taken advantage by cheapos,btohqsg
means u call up cs ?,btohqsg
I just  see today i purely car orders no tips,btohqsg

Customer offer to cancel the other driver cos he feel badI say if u cancel him he will feel worse üòÖ,btohqsg
Then u send half of the item then other driver send another half ah. Haha. Then split the cost,btohqsg
Idea ü§îBut then item is a tshirt cannot split ü§£,btohqsg
Green car very stylo  think her hubby or boyfriend car lol,btohqsg
In 2017  a man invited a 13-year-old girl to Kallang Riverside Park for a chat  and later forced her to drink vodka before raping and sodomising her.The man  who has previous convictions including of sexual assault  was sentenced today:https://cna.asia/38WdGq7,btohqsg
Bo pien le. User block my number liao.,btohqsg
Every day sure have this. Lalamove driver/riders become loanshark knock door.,btohqsg
Careful guys when picking job at night. U doesnt know that u are the lucky winner become loanshark collector. But worst still  do work for free.,btohqsg
I got say b4Yes its this guy ryan with this bedok addWhen i kena also west area  cck and bp,btohqsg
You block him back in the appWait accidentally accept his job again,btohqsg
Ya i block already. This week 2 times i kena this kind of job. But different user.,btohqsg
Cash. 1st pickup point is where they want u to knock the house.,btohqsg
Ya night time i dun take cash orders unless i know the place,btohqsg
Good morning  can I just check  does this exceed MPV requirements?,btohqsg
The wooden planks of a wardrobe,btohqsg
Wooden itself should be ok. But if add some more stuff should exceed,btohqsg
Car and MPV almost the same.,btohqsg
Knn all this FT want cheap,btohqsg
Knn report to LALAMOVE they say they will check. Scold them to get improve. Now at least pay me some fees go there also use petrol. They say have to investigate nbcb. Confirm never get anything.,btohqsg
Second time I kana FT like that. Last time one indian guy book MPV and ask me move dressing table with mirror all by myself,btohqsg
I could say not them also. Many I encounter also want cheap. LALAMOVE already give them cheap price yet they still want cheaper by going to the lowest vehicle.,btohqsg
Can we all like feedback to llm to change the system,btohqsg
Was thinking of this this morning,btohqsg
ya you can charge them 50% and reject the job,btohqsg
I also kena before  durian. Say motorbike job  when reached. 6 red plastic bag. Knn 6 red plastic bag can fit meh motorbike. CB lucky I drive car.,btohqsg
I will do so by today,btohqsg
Hope u guys do the same,btohqsg
There needs to be more protection for us drivers. Lalamove so interested in protecting the customer interest that they forget us,btohqsg
I everytime livechat with them. Tekan them on the chat after they cannot tahan  they end the chat.,btohqsg
Bloody hell can change new app. But never do anything about our feedback,btohqsg
Ya. I know. As they every told me. Livechat is outsource. That is why they only operate till 10pm. But apps 24hours.,btohqsg
Yes they give us a chance to feed our families by giving us jobs  but they dont seem to understand that without us  they are nothing. It is only because of our hardwork that they can enjoy the luxury of air con offices,btohqsg
Knn if anything happen  must wait till tomorrow. People die already by the time.,btohqsg
That's why do after 10pm job very risky. If anything happen  u solve yourself first. Tomorrow after 8am then LALAMOVE rescue,btohqsg
Ok  i will go down to ubi on monday,btohqsg
Hope u guys join the bandwagon,btohqsg
Nice one. Better to show what is inside this conversation. What people like us are facing.,btohqsg
Im not kidding i will take selfie n show u guys haha,btohqsg
U show this chatroom also. So they can understand. Or better still  ask them to join.,btohqsg
So they can know what we are facing. Although they are in office.,btohqsg
If it cant fit in a car  confirm exceedIf it cant fit on a trolley  confirm exceedFor MPV,btohqsg
We like mad dog work  they are smiling enjoying coffee eat commission. üòÇ But no improvement for us. Incentive 10am-2pm and 4pm-8pm. Knn how to reach till 25jobs for 3days.,btohqsg
Just to make more people do the job. But I could say is super hard to hit their incentive.,btohqsg
Oh... have you not met dailoualvin?ü§£ü§£ü§£Gold tier incentive (60t/week  10-2pm  4-8pm) with 20+ week streakalvineh...how many weeks exactly ah?,btohqsg
In that case he take nearby single trip. Usually I don't take. Wah! Power la he...,btohqsg
Car hard lei do their incentive. Example load item and push trolley already take time,btohqsg
Dont take from neighbourhoodDo food car jobs,btohqsg
There are some restaurants that book car jobs regularly due to the nature of their foodEg pizza  cake  chinese restaurant (always big orders),btohqsg
Ya I saw. But usually I take multiple stop. Rather than single stop. Maybe that's y can't hit,btohqsg
Oh ya laIncentive must short sweet and fast,btohqsg
Ya lor. Hahaha. Btw thanks for the tips too.,btohqsg
Multi stop better for off peakYou want to maximise taking jobs with priority fee during peak  quick short trips the more the betterPeak traffic not great for long dist also,btohqsg
Nobody ask u abt your oil lah üôÑ,btohqsg
U carry him  that's y he want to sell oil,btohqsg

Use car like hard to earn,btohqsg
I drive two days pump petrol one time ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Every 2 days i pump $50 abt 40% of tank,btohqsg
I maintain fuel at full tank,btohqsg
$50 with 20% discount = $40 per day need at least do $50 order,btohqsg
If exceed 50kg then it‚Äôs not MPV. However if it fits your MPV even if not exceed 50kg it‚Äôs acceptable,btohqsg
I seeI jus loaded a secret lab arm chair,btohqsg
But can fit in a car,btohqsg
Lucky i never demand for adjust earnings,btohqsg
hyundai avante  includes driving kids to sch etc la,btohqsg
I work mostly from 10am to 3-4pm,btohqsg
Only 1-2 days in a week will work till 8,btohqsg
Sometimes dun work go out n dating lol,btohqsg
But ya every 2 days i pump fuel $50 worth,btohqsg
For car how much earning per day is considered good,btohqsg
Single size bed frame need 1.7 or 2.4?,btohqsg

U need to read ur handouts lol,btohqsg
Basically as long as no one complains  u can send whatever timing u like,btohqsg
First 10 mins of waiting is free  after tt every 10mins u wait  u will be compensated,btohqsg
Where can i get e handouts?,btohqsg
Oodle orders r strict they will call n check on u if u seems to be late,btohqsg
Lala app under profile go help centre,btohqsg
Hi just to chk with u guys on this,btohqsg
When the restaurant says the order is late then u need to livechat,btohqsg
Wah what happened. Dinner hour so little jobs,btohqsg
Tell them the time u arrive,btohqsg
When you reach  do not press pick up. When you waited for 10 mins inform Cs what time u arrive. And when pick up the item infd then too. Then press pick up,btohqsg
I always take picture   picture of time at restaurant  picture of time (if late) of restaurant n food to prove,btohqsg
Sometime  I ask myself why their SOP is so wonderful,btohqsg
They need to fix their lousy live chat first,btohqsg
Actually live chat OK leh. I always can chat with them,btohqsg
This is nonsense laYour arrival is determined by gps and you only need to inform csNo such thing as must live chat the moment u arrive  thats so silly,btohqsg
C.Kyou can try asking same qn to different cso  they will prob tell u something different,btohqsg
Ok noted. Thanks for e advice,btohqsg
All the Cs will say different thing,btohqsg
Their gps koyak what. Sometimes deliver liao practically in front of the house swipe to complete job says I'm too far from destination üôÑ,btohqsg
This morning alrdy sense something wrong lol,btohqsg
Hmm... it‚Äôs best to contact support once the pick up is late .,btohqsg
Then if your driving MPV you will be upgraded . That‚Äôs the problem   only if you drive higher tier you can get upgraded . So if you drive a car you can only catch bike jobs and get upgraded to car .,btohqsg

And I called to make sure both orders r ok to collect together,btohqsg
Hello all i'm new to lalamove. Is lalamove 24 hours or at night no more orders?,btohqsg
They do send to nearby driversWhat they're saying is jobs in the east gets snapped up fast  thats why you keep seeing jobs that are left oversIt's far becos the ones u see alrdy went thru 1 round of drivers who are nearerAlso means you need to find better spot to camp,btohqsg
No container only super bike  üòÜ,btohqsg
See farNo need thinkGood 1 no so far 1üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya lor so must camp different place lor,btohqsg
Do you guys find it more difficult that now the orders come in and we cannot differentiate it by the direction??,btohqsg
Like last time can narrow down the orders by west  east  north and south,btohqsg
Ya. That why I don't do llm liao. I do gf,btohqsg

how are you getting so many $5 orders when the starting base is $10? my order revenue is already after commission  i get numbers like 10.52  not round numbers. information fee seems to be something else.,btohqsg
and i dont get information on all orders. in fact most orders dont have this fee.,btohqsg
cannot be the 16%... his info fee numbers are way too large. one of them ($9.38) is higher than the order revenue ($5). 16% of $5 is only 80c.,btohqsg
did u take a lot of cash orders?,btohqsg
could be the 16% deduction from the cash collected. but have to check against order history. cash collected not shown in balance details.,btohqsg

Hi. How is fare for round trip calculated?,btohqsg
Eg from Thomson to Tampines and Thomson again?,btohqsg
So it doesn‚Äôt calculated basis total mileage??,btohqsg
Means it‚Äôs just Point A to Point B. And then +4 or +8 depending on motorcycle or car??,btohqsg
Eg. Jurong West to Pasir Ris is approx 25 bucks by motorcycle. A round trip would be +4 total 29???!!!,btohqsg
No  because round trip is only meant for documents or small items (eg signed invoice)  you are to return it any time before day ends. Ie. Return at your convenienceIt is not meant to be a double trip,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs the case...then there‚Äôs something inherently skewed with the fare computation,btohqsg
But if my order is at 8pm. Anytime before the day ends is like 4hrs?,btohqsg
You need to understand the services better  all these should have been in the web training or your handouts,btohqsg
Shit. Should never take round trip jobs.,btohqsg
Short term memory. I forget stuff,btohqsg
Anyway thanks for replying me. Much appreciated,btohqsg
Update. I think they clicked round trip by mistake. Haha. Extra 4 bucks,btohqsg
