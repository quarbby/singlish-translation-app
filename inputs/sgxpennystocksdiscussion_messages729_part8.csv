Everyone to keep ä¸‰åŠ›in watchlist.(Earlier call out when price $0.087 to $0.090)I believe this is going to be one of my power calls come 2023 similar to the below gang- LHN call $0.099 (3-4x)- Hanwell call $0.198 (2x)- GKE call $0.067 (3x)- PanUnited call $0.280 (1.7x) etc and many more.This counter more for investment than trading at this point still. But I see it getting liquid soon and as we all know liquidity comes at a premium.Meantime  those who have holding power can consider hard. Do your own research too.The very least  put in your watchlist.Iâ€™ve scanned and did plenty of research and thereâ€™s plenty of catalyst coming for this IMO.Will share more soon.DYODDHave a nice weekend,btohqsg
Illiquid still and limited scrips for ä¸‰åŠ›.But can tell that itâ€™s time will come eventually and very soon based on my recent study,btohqsg

What's the dividend yield? if for investment.. while waiting capital gains..,btohqsg
Sanli Environmental paying dividends for the past 5 years even during Covid-19 period.Only Company with Strong FA can make profits and give dividends in covid-19 period.Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m convinced of stellar results this half year as work force get stronger  more work done = more progressive billing  better looking results,btohqsg
