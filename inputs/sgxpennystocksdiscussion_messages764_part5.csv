üéâPika World Daily Update- 22 Feb 2023üéâüß∏Markets retracement in motionüßÆStocks dropped sharply on Tuesday as investors realized a higher probability of a 0.5% rate hike in the March FOMC meeting. In addition  the latest earnings from retailers such as Walmart and Home Depot added disappointment with worries on weakening earnings forecast on the horizon.This is sufficient to wipe out all gains for Dow and put the index into the red territory for the year. The 10-year Treasury yield hit nearly 4%  adding pressure to Nasdaq.üí∞Economic data showed resilienceüçèThe latest S&P 500 Global Flash Composite Output Index that helps to track the manufacturing and service sectors saw it hit a high of 50.2  underpinning the strong demand for services even as manufacturing still shows signs of weakness. It should not be surprising given that we also saw a solid retail sales of 3% rise in January last week  exceeding the 1.7% expectation.This points to the Fed having more groundwork for dampening economic demand; thus  robust data might be bad news for the equity market.üìÆWhat's on the menu today?üìäThe key highlight for today will be the FOMC minutes which will be released at 3 am. This will shed light on FOMC members' inclination on the pace of rate hikes and assessment of the general economy.It is 22 Feb  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It has been a challenging trading day  and we hope all friends have a recharging week ahead!From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg
