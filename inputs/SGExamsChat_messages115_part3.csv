Being able to communicate with your fellow researchers is a different skillset from being able to communicate to your average student  wouldn't you say?,btohqsg
Somewhat yes and no? In either case you assume your audience to have some kind of common knowledge and build upon it.,btohqsg
Yeah  and the kind of common knowledge that a professor and a university student has  is vastly inferior to the common knowledge that fellow professors have,btohqsg
But if you knew your audience's common knowledge is it that ridiculous to expect you know how to teach for that given knowledge?Obviously IRL a professor doesn't exactly know what the audience's knowledge is.Most egregious examples of bad teaching come from weird assumptions of knowledge.E.g.  when asked 'what an example of a Banach Space ' a professor replied the dual space of a Banach space is an example of a Banach Space. (about as useful as saying that the dual cone of some set X is an example of a cone),btohqsg
This example is a great example of weird assumption of knowledge,btohqsg
