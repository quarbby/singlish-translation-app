Same range lel. If ure looking at this series. Take Toyota for reliability and fc.,btohqsg
Bro. How about just go test drive,btohqsg
Go test drive. Otherwise. Take Toyota for all time favourite,btohqsg
Then I go for Vios lor  I‚Äôm familiar with it and had been driving in CDC for past few months,btohqsg
Only thing is quite hard to find a community for this Vios,btohqsg
Shd be easy la. Go fb or what.,btohqsg
Soon to take TP test. Won‚Äôt be driving on roads so soon. But I know the Vios is decent for even a learner.,btohqsg
Anywya. I seldom see vios on the road now. City and jazz also lesser alr.,btohqsg
Now ure new so ure stuck with Vios üòÇ,btohqsg
There‚Äôs also one more car I had been interested lol,btohqsg
Kona 1st Gen Electric which CDC also have,btohqsg
After you got license just go walk around the automobile megamart in ubi and test drive a few,btohqsg
dont forget maintenance cost  insurance and road tax,btohqsg
Maintain your car well  don't screw it  the car cost be fine. The majority of the cost is how much u pay for it,btohqsg
What nonsense advice u need today,btohqsg
Ok. In tht case  please buy a driving school Vios,btohqsg
Anywya. Jason is very senior in this group. Try to read between his lines he is trying to convey something logical.,btohqsg
No la. I sprout rubbish only,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a believer of sticker really add bhp,btohqsg
Tbh His comments v sarcastic n condescending  reveal a troubling lack of empathy. Don‚Äôt know what he has been thru‚Ä¶,btohqsg
anyway.. do yall buy detailing equipment like vacuum  brush  those products to clean the interior of the car?,btohqsg
Or yall send to detailers to do for you and if so how much for interior detailing?,btohqsg
Use the $1 carpark vac and plastic shine,btohqsg
Buy car limit to driving school models? Thats new üòÜ,btohqsg
Give chance. Cos thts e only one of the few cars he touched,btohqsg
His choices all driving sch cars,btohqsg
My learning car in cdc was Honda City,btohqsg
I also ended up buying Honda City,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with driving sch carsss,btohqsg
But u explore first  keep other cars in mind also. See which suits u best,btohqsg
Got 1 colleague c I drive nice car  then say to me ‚Äúu show off what u lack.‚Äù  then I reply ‚ÄúI show off what u lack.‚Äù,btohqsg
Vios is a simple car that gets you from point A to B. Audio quality is good and ur average petrol run costs $65+ after SPC and card discounts,btohqsg
Can look for VOGS and get their opinion and lobang if you are considering,btohqsg
Vacuum u can use those small portable ones like Eluxgo.. Sometimes i bring it down to vacuum the car.,btohqsg
Interior i pay ppl to do,btohqsg
But my interior vacuum do in JB once a week so...,btohqsg
That time I go hydrowash detailing,btohqsg
neutral parking brake - shift to park,btohqsg
Wah I better practice this too,btohqsg
No hand brake  no gear shifter how,btohqsg
Dunno what is hand brake anymore,btohqsg
Electronics shifters with electronic parking brake,btohqsg
Jeez... u can only drive so many cars in a lifetime. Pls don waste it by driving vios,btohqsg
Same 13k depre can get vezel. Much better drive and interior. Definitely make up for the toyota reliability. Problem abt buying this type of cars are that the mileage might be tampered due to it being a common phv car,btohqsg
For press button do we still need to follow the neutral parking brake - shift to park,btohqsg
U ask those who invent the steps,btohqsg
Same ppl who ask u off aircon  before u shut down the car and ask u warm up engine for 10mins before driving,btohqsg
And rev it before moving off,btohqsg
no idea if actually NEED to  but i still do in my 2023 vezel,btohqsg
I think this is quite crucial for old cars. Actually when i spoke to the service ppl  they said newer vehicles less impt but is good to do,btohqsg
