Plus if u can pass AP test  may as well take the module for free A,btohqsg
when it comes to abstract proofs everyone gets wrecked,btohqsg
Also  if you are interested in UK unis  some require FM for a maths major,btohqsg
The new requirement was after his time,btohqsg
I think it’s the year I entered JC,btohqsg
It’s said to be the most intensive mathematics course in the country,btohqsg
how to even get in sia wt,btohqsg
Turns out they aren’t that selective with step,btohqsg
The average offer only needs to get avg of half the question right (Step 3),btohqsg
paper 3 is for ppl who do fmath only,btohqsg
I'll probably die if I apply for it,btohqsg
My H3 teachers stole Step II and III questions for our tutorials,btohqsg
I think John mentioned it to me befroe,btohqsg
Recently they introduced matrices to step,btohqsg
You will also be doing it during 1101R,btohqsg
sem 2 prof allow u to use gc,btohqsg
thank god im not taking pure maths,btohqsg
Linear algebra is a staple of science,btohqsg
your school did give you a talk on it right?,btohqsg
Yes but I forgot most of that already,btohqsg
Even with the GC right  the paper was quite tedious to the extent that the without GC papers were faster to do than this sem's paper,btohqsg
because this sem he allowed us to use matlab,btohqsg
It’s ok I’m pretty sure i know how to write,btohqsg
thats why the numbers are huge,btohqsg
But you also have to write rref steps right,btohqsg
I spent 3 days trying to do it right,btohqsg
he allow u to directly quote,btohqsg
Tbh your paper isn't super easy as well,btohqsg
at least only 1 proof qn though,btohqsg
Questions were in the wrong order,btohqsg
Somehow questions 1 and 2 were the hardest ones,btohqsg
As in questions were in the wrong order b/c q1 and q2 were the hardest,btohqsg
I love converting shit into row echelon form by hand,btohqsg
Gone  reduced to row echelon form,btohqsg
What the fish  that’s not 1 meter!,btohqsg
idk why will he allow matlab though,btohqsg
he should put more unknowns so ppl cant use matlab,btohqsg
Tbh it's not that bad also,btohqsg
Allowing the use of matlab lets the prof focus more on technical questions,btohqsg
Oh right but I was going to say that even with matlab  some of the questions are still very tedious,btohqsg
Like there isn't one nice operation in matlab to do all the steps at once,btohqsg
if u copy wrongly or type wrongly,btohqsg
and u nvr show steps no marks for working,btohqsg
But whatever the bell curve will make all things equal,btohqsg
If the paper is easy then the curve will shift to the right,btohqsg
So the prof shouldn't be worried about setting brutal papers,btohqsg
One of my math profs loves T/F questions because he says it will simulate a very nice bell curve,btohqsg
There was one year the midterm was nothing more than 100 T/F questions (I think  according to my senior),btohqsg
otherwise some joker just anyhow circle all True,btohqsg
If you can get all wrong on a T/F paper I'll give you 100%,btohqsg
