Hello newbie question  If someone does competitive tbill at 3.5% and cutoff is 4%. He gets 100%  but does he get 3.5% returns or 4% returns?,btohqsg
So for competitive bidders they either get 100% allotted or 0% based on their threshold? Does non competitive bidders get 100% allotted?,btohqsg
Yes to your first questionMaybe to your second question. Depends on total non competitive demand vs the non competitive allocation.,btohqsg
Ah ic. Based on tranche volume  so meaning that if there's more apply than 60% then will be proportioned...,btohqsg
What I don't understand is.. Why isn't there any downside to those who lowball,btohqsg
i'm not sure what is the comp vs non comp allocation but if non comp totals $500 million and total allocation to non comp is $300 million  then there will be a fixed amount given to all non comp buyers,btohqsg
there is.. the low ballers helped to drag the final cutoff yield lowerthink of it this way.. if 100% of competitive bidders put 1% yield  the cut off yield will be 1%,btohqsg
Wow.. One sink all sink. But it's even worse for those non competitive isn't it... Say for those who use cpf.. Why would they even want 1%,btohqsg
Just to check for the CIMB welcome offer of 20000 miles  are the qualifying spend restricted to hey max merchants only?,btohqsg

I just purchased T bills from my DBS iBanking 2 days ago. But cannot see any record of that transaction on my CDP account. (I've never used my CDP account before and opened it last year but it's been idle since) any idea when/how T-bill transactions show on my CDP account?,btohqsg
I think there is a mismatch between my CDP NRIC (am an EP holder) so it doesn't work with Singpass  but the number is correct,btohqsg
Hi  would you recommend those with Citi Premieremiles card who bought air tickets with it stick to the complimentary travel insurance from HL Assurance?,btohqsg
Did you check on the tbill issue date?It will be credited into your CDP only on the issue date,btohqsg
There won't be any record of the transaction in progress or acknowledgement from CDP after the money is taken from my DBS account?,btohqsg
It's the way this market works. The last successful bid sets the rate.,btohqsg
Hello! With UOB One Account  what happens if on a particial month I miss the $500 spending? Does it affect the internet rate for that month only  or the entire quarter? Thanks,btohqsg
