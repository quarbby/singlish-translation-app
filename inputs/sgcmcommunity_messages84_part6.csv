Why do some of the photos have very bad chromatic abberations?,btohqsg
OKAY mr i am a photographer,btohqsg
fun fact lewis sat in this car for the gp hahaha,btohqsg
Wasn't it the other unit with the other plate?,btohqsg
The other one was the maybach that Toto Wolff used,btohqsg
I don’t want a car Lewis sat in…,btohqsg
I’m not sure that’s necessarily linked… ?besides the group behind bluesg is very experienced in leasing business.,btohqsg
Means… for rentals  PLEASE DRIVE IT AS RESPONSIBLY AS YOU CAN  OTHERWISE DON’T GO CRYING WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR CHARGES BASED ON THE RENTAL AGREEMENT!,btohqsg
Huh? Should be able to dispute …? Time to go to.. CASE! Hahahaa,btohqsg
No lah  I just didn’t pay 🤣,btohqsg
Cancelled my card and moved on in life. They sent a letter of demand and I said see you in court 🤣Never heard from them since.,btohqsg
Yes. Don’t accept it next time pls whatever you do.,btohqsg
Not sure if you will find one in your living room but .. recommendation would be to download SG Carmart App and go from there!! Lots of beautiful units in there for you to choose from 🥰@SGCM_Admin,btohqsg
You are?? Didn’t know you’re a photographer sir. Wah so multi talented. 😉,btohqsg
Usually it's the user that is the problem... attitude and mentality. There are some who takes care of it for the next user  then there are those who dun give a F,btohqsg
Lol I dun think I like it when rear passenger can control the Aircon 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Not everyone has the budget to buy expensive lens like you mah!!!!!! RICH PEOPLE THINGS!!! hhahahah.,btohqsg
where got... IPHONE 4 IS CHEAPOOO,btohqsg
Ok but seriously … quite a fair bit.. scenes also not very high contrast also.. maybe@SGCM_Adminshould consider employing you to shoot for them or ask your team to help with the photo edits.,btohqsg
Why? But those controls are for the rear passengers to control their own rear zone aircon lehhhhhh.,btohqsg
Good feature to have although it is certainly not a new feature since they’ve been in cars before 2010,btohqsg
Means… your photo edit skill is top class,btohqsg
The car is afterall small mah 😂 I like 24 low they adjust 21 high I also affected 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Good morning folks  idk why I keep finding idiots who cannot turn properly,btohqsg
It's like he tried to follow the line which is for my lane when he supposed to go wide,btohqsg
Reliable or not? Rare breed on the road translates to high maintenance and spare part cost. Hahaha,btohqsg
It's very very very very common lol to the point that I'm wondering how they passed🤭🤭,btohqsg
What HUD you using? Can recommend?,btohqsg
Oooooo it’s nice. I love it when cool air blows on my b@tt,btohqsg
he was using his phone while driving...,btohqsg
Actually alot of people do that,btohqsg
I don't see much actually  but just these few days keep raining all the dumbasses come out,btohqsg
I experienced the left driver make a u turn,btohqsg
It is a sign that you will get the craftech front bumper soon..,btohqsg
Love it. It’s Friday. GOOD VIBES PEOPLE!!!!,btohqsg
I see this everyday I come off PIE to Paya Lebar..,btohqsg
No one knows how to take a corner..,btohqsg
Too busy catching us with ‘illegal exhausts’ and ‘extreme mods',btohqsg
Your Paya Lebar junction TOO WIDE lah.,btohqsg
But really  it’s a stock maser 😂,btohqsg
Ah? I own the road ah?,btohqsg
Exactly. Me too. Do nothing illegal  drive without looking over shoulder with fear of being stopped by men in white (who are simply doing their jobs by the way) 🤓,btohqsg
I don’t see TP stopping the taxis speeding or the vezels making illegal u turns or brake checking in the rain 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Was this in the last 5 years? 😂,btohqsg
WE NEED MORE TP ON THE ROAD!!,btohqsg
no no .. to be fair I think these boys are really working hard. Snipering more these days too,btohqsg
I love to see the TP on bikes,btohqsg
At least the drivers will behave,btohqsg
me too sir!!! I always wave good morning to them and take out my phone to take video of them to warn ma fellow Waze friends,btohqsg
I drive behind them slowly so that the cars behind me get impatient. Then I change lane to let them speed up,btohqsg
