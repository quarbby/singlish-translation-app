Then take the better deal. Read the t&c first and then make the informed decision on which is the better deal.,btohqsg
best deal  you have 1 ladies card  your wife have 1  your mother have 1  your father have 1  your sister have 1. then all share cover 5 category.LOLü§£,btohqsg
Anyway while we are on this topic of ladies card. Where do I go to switch categories ah?,btohqsg
Sorry guys  maybe I miss it. Can I check is there any ways to pay income tax using credit cards to get the rebate or miles? Thanks,btohqsg
You can use the keyword ‚ÄúIncome tax miles‚Äù to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Thanks a lot. I did do some research  there is a certain fee for using it. Like what I did previously Honey SG taught me paying using Axa by grab pay. But now showing Error.,btohqsg
My personal choice is use citi Payall for income tax and insurance during promo period.,btohqsg
You need to search recent months videos,btohqsg
Applied in App for UOB Lady's yesterday 4 July 9pm and received approval SMS today 8.37am 5 July. Card number without CVV viewable on desktop but not in App. Existing EVOL card holder with income well below $80K.,btohqsg
Error is because you are using the funds from your non-transferable balance (i.e. top-up from credit cards),btohqsg
sad  i still not yet receive approval SMS,btohqsg
uob chat assistant is a joke.. i was in queue twice and when got to position 1. suddenly they say chat ended because large volume,btohqsg

FAVE is good. Have cashback itself and count as credit card spend.,btohqsg
Depends on which card. Not all cards will count it towards spending.,btohqsg
Cashback is stuck in ur fave account haha cannot withdraw,btohqsg
I can use the cashback on next purchase of fruit & veg.,btohqsg
Yup. Make sure use before it expires.,btohqsg
Seem like a hype to switch between uob lady / crmc. Better think if u can spend on that category if not become orphans points later unless big soender,btohqsg
Sorry boss wasn't aware you already had this,btohqsg

It's equal to buying miles. If dont want spend anything then just use cc or paynow pay direct without any rewards,btohqsg
Not the right place to do this,btohqsg
Found out that:1) there some users including myself that haven‚Äôt had this promo updated in-app. Workaround is to contact moomoo and they will manually register for u2) at the start  u must decide if u want the 5.8% 30-day coupon for the 10k or 50k deposit tranche. U will only get 1 coupon.If u aim for the 10k deposit 1st then over the promo period u accumulated $50k deposit  that won‚Äôt trigger a 2nd voucher.3) depositing is just the 1st part  for each tier  u need to make 5trades or 7 trades  respectively.,btohqsg
üòäright now we have 58th National Day Special OfferÔºåyou can get up to $380 cash bonus starting July 5th~https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_728register here:https://invest.sg.moomoo.com/58nationaldayAbove the advertisement sms I got from MooMoo. I called them. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a scam. It‚Äôs legit. U can always arrange for a callback from them to verify,btohqsg
Besides the coupon  the 1 yr free commission on Singapore stocks seems like a good deal.U still have to pay platform fees but at least that‚Äôs a fixed amount.,btohqsg
Hi  I just opened OCBC 360 account.  Does it matter if I transfer 100k into it straight away or only at the end of the month? Does it affect the interest credited in next month?,btohqsg

yes  this is the current welcome offer for moomoohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/106244,btohqsg

giro to HSBC to get 1% cashback,btohqsg
if you want to transfer today  you should transfer a higher amount so that the daily average balance for the month will be 100k. but I'm not very sure whether new accounts have any pro-ration but I suspect no.,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt see anything yet in my EGA too,btohqsg
