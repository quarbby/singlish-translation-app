They usually give 1 month notice. So if nerf should be 1st Jun onward,btohqsg
I started with UOB cos I don’t want to monitor MAB.  Maybe if OCBC don’t revise then I consider changing to OCBC. Anyway any of 3 banks doing well  I will be happy cos I bought stocks for all 3 banks 😂,btohqsg
Sry dont know if this is a stupid qn regarding ocbc 360… transfer to my OCBC 360 account today(sat) will be reflected on saturday right?eg if my day end balance is 5k on friday  i top up 8k today  my day end balance for saturday will be 13k right? Or will the 13k be only reflected on monday and it assumes my balance is still 5k on saturday,btohqsg
Transfer from other banks? I don’t think so. Bank don’t work on weekends. You should do on working day to be safe,btohqsg
"hahaha banks dont ""work"" weekends  but the funds transferred are reflected. was just wondering how they account for it on the MAB standpoint for OCBC360. seems that there's conflicting...",btohqsg
That is the part. If they operate similar to UOB  the UOB one interest tracker will syn on weekdays and sometimes a-3 days later. It is best to do earlier  you don’t want to lose your interest just cos they syn a few days later,btohqsg
So MAB does it operate the same? We don’t know unless you call their customer service to ask,btohqsg
so if i change the context from above to 5k day end on sat  and i put in 8k on sun  will my day end balance for sun be 5k? or only on mon ?,btohqsg
thanks sir. so safe to assume that any funds added inbetween day ends will always settle and reflect in the day end balances except for funds added on sunday  where it will only be reflected on monday day end?,btohqsg
Are u prepared for not having the money back?,btohqsg
You want the interest. He want your principle😂,btohqsg
Under Moneylenders Act section 3  it says “Any person  other than an excluded moneylender  who lends a sum of money in consideration of alargersum being repaid shall be presumed  until the contrary is proved  to be a moneylender.” In other words  the lender is considered guilty of operating as an unlicensed moneylender unless proven otherwise (i.e. guilty by default).,btohqsg
MAB across the board is the same...,btohqsg
Morning all  OCBC Titanium Rewards no longer offer 4mpd for electronics  but if I get an ipad via lazada  then that transaction will still qualify for 4mpd yes?,btohqsg
Received Citi Cashback statement today. They adjusted bonus for Grocery to 5.8%  but none of my private commutes (CDG  Grab & TADA) received the bonus 7.8%. They must forgot to add it in their code 🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
You have to use for the month after the 2nd quarter statement to use the cashback. Maybe like use $50 then pay the rest with EVOL?,btohqsg
You might want to calculate again. It should still be 8% cashback from groceries and 0.25% cashback from private commutes.,btohqsg
No. My calculation is correct. Refer to TnC,btohqsg
So your statement date is today and your transactions for private commutes from 1 Apr till 5 Apr are not 8% but instead 0.2%/0.25% only? Are they posted already?,btohqsg
All private commutes before 1st April got 0.25% and after 1st 0.20%. My base cashback is correct. Bonus given only for Dining & Grocery at 5.8% (I have few transactions only). And read TnC: bonus is for entire statement  not 1 Apr till 5 Apr,btohqsg
Here’s the explanation of how to calculate according to Citi:https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/cashback/citi-cash-back-card/pdf/cashbackFAQs.pdf,btohqsg
Ah I missed out that portion on computing. Maybe you need to call CSO to check on the system already. Assuming you didn't do wallet top-ups.,btohqsg
Private commute  petrol  dining and groceries transactions will earn the revised bonus cash back rates if yourstatement date falls after 31 March 2024 as bonus cash back is computed on your statement end date based on yourtotal spend amount.,btohqsg
You didn't do wallet top-ups right?,btohqsg
I think the issue is because they implemented Transaction Description for Private Commute. But it’s not always same as they put in the TnC. These are the descriptions on my statement:Cabcharge Asia Pte Ltd SINGAPORE SGGrab* Awith some referenceTADA RIDEwith some reference,btohqsg
I’m not a newbie. And my calculations is exactly if I remove bonus for Private Commute. And it’s excel  not manual calculations.,btohqsg
I think as long MCC and partial description is the same  the transactions should be part of their calculations. Maybe ask CSO  maybe they will readjust and deposit on a later date?,btohqsg
They put it in their TnC. And since asterisk (*) is missing (e.g TADA*)  it looks like it requires exact match. Anyway  I’ll need to contact and appeal,btohqsg
"They put in TnC after the table  ""starting with description""  no need exact match. So definitely something is wrong with their system for the calculation on their end",btohqsg
Yup  there’s a bug in their code 😂,btohqsg
Their CSOs probably getting spammed for the last few days 🤣,btohqsg
Do I need to do anything for this Syfe enhance to get started ? It’s been 5 days and looks like it’s not moving,btohqsg
Morning all  just wanted to check if I use Kris+ with CRMC does it count as online transaction or need pair with amaze?,btohqsg
Yes coz lazada is in the whitelist specific out in ocbc titanium tnc,btohqsg
"You can tap on ""why do I see only cash here""",btohqsg
It tells me 3-4 days to get invested but my funds entered in 1th April and it’s been 4 days 😅,btohqsg
Maybe have to wait for Monday liao,btohqsg

Question. I used UOB Lady Solitaire card to pay for cruise. If I choose Travel as my bonus category  I should be 4 miles per dollar. Right? However  when I checked my statement  for a sum of $1921  UOB only rewarded me with 384 uni$. Something wrong?,btohqsg
That is the base rate  bonus come next month,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the clarification.,btohqsg
It is stated in tnc  anything not clear best to read the tnc,btohqsg
You don’t need to link UoB lady to amaze for local purchase,btohqsg
