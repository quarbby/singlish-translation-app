Scammers pattern more than badminton.-Take note guys. Also if your friend called you or your contractor doing some renovations or aircon servicing etc called you saying “ His no changed” “Alert Please”‼️ The next day he might called/ ask you to help paynow some money upfront to get some raw material etc or your friend wants to borrow money. Double confirmed call up your friend/contractor to verify 1st before paynow. Twice the story I heard was scam call  once money transferred or paynow  bye. So high alert when you received call  “bro I’m Derrick/Eddie or so and so  my phone no changed” ‼️ Scammers 😤,btohqsg
