"If you were in the Telegram groupchat  you would've most probably noticed that we pinned a link relating to something called ""99Drivers"". And now  we would like to announce that 99Drivers will be our new project mainly for Singapore car enthusiasts to gather and communicate in our Discord! Implementing this server also means that virtual meet announcements will now be announced there to keep this Telegram channel solely for Singapore Car Meets.99Drivers will also feature a ROBLOX Racing Team  as we plan to venture into racing leagues into games such as Midnight Racing: Tokyo or maybe even ION FORMULA 1! We hope you are as excited as we are  and thank you for supporting SCM!Discord:https://discord.gg/U6d5NRGshPInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/99drivers/",btohqsg
