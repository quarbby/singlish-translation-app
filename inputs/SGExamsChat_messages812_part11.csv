Goddam 1 week of holiday left and did jack shittt,btohqsg
Actually must see who is contesting the place,btohqsg
Like if you put Nicole  Pritam and some random dude in Tampines and they contest,btohqsg
Don't think I ever saw the hammer losing their deposit before,btohqsg
Well I feel Jamus Lim will be contesting for the Punggol/SK,btohqsg
Then Tampines I have no idea,btohqsg
They probably gonna keep Jamus and try to develop him as the anchor,btohqsg
Plus he's popular amongst the young voters,btohqsg
Yeah SK and Punggol is New Town,btohqsg
Nicole is no longer in wp coz of sth…pritam will permanently sit himself in aljunied + it is most certain wp will get aljunied nd pap gave up on aljunied alr coz they dun want risk losing an anchor,btohqsg
Like I don't recall her being in WP before,btohqsg
No she gone liao from politics,btohqsg
Cuz errr she got affair with Leon,btohqsg
I think she will stay in sk to make sk strong…jamus wun be able to solo tank,btohqsg
I don't really remember all these sorry,btohqsg
My impression of her is that she is in NSP,btohqsg
2020 first election she ran wp,btohqsg
That one is like GE 2015 then again 2020 I feel like was yesterday,btohqsg
My sense of time fucked up liao,btohqsg
I dun think they ever did,btohqsg
It is usually the independent ones that lose their deposit,btohqsg
