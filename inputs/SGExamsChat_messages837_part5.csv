YIJC even worse teachers definitely miss,btohqsg
so YI only wins on the change to a level grading system,btohqsg
Feel like teachers is hard to absolutely confirm thk,btohqsg
time to study for O Level üòâ,btohqsg
which is why the way to go is YI  then just self study,btohqsg
in the age of chatgpt you really can learn almost everything on your own,btohqsg
though if you cannot self study best advice to give people who cannot go anywhere else is to just retake,btohqsg
sure can at least make it to jp/tm,btohqsg
yi still bigger school and students have some semblance of a brain so still better culture,btohqsg
then no need to go YI just take the exam as private candidate,btohqsg
school still will give some sort of support,btohqsg
I feel school is more useful to help you feel less alone when studying,btohqsg
simply because it's a bigger school I think it's alot easier to find someone you can connect with,btohqsg
MI 2/3 of people who enter in y1 will leave before graduation,btohqsg
if being bullied principal and teacher do not care,btohqsg
but that's such a small part of school experience still,btohqsg
the thing about retaking o levels is you can take the papers individually unlike a levels,btohqsg
just that idk if 16 year olds will have the self discipline to study,btohqsg
significantly easier since don't have to juggle so many subjects,btohqsg
India driving test is just start engine and drive few meter only,btohqsg
there was a treasure hunt one 2 yrs ago in rp as well  it was found in rp at the spiral staircase i think,btohqsg
Is this the first clue? Wahaha good luck to all!!,btohqsg
nah that was where a coin was found 2 yrs ago,btohqsg
But media says do not go to private if you want high pay jobs,btohqsg
I no catch ball what the fuck u tryna say,btohqsg
so the only option is cry,btohqsg
MI got bad review  YI aso got bad review,btohqsg
You mean the whole y2 you only studying your h1 meh...,btohqsg
wherever u go and wtv u do is fully up to you,btohqsg
u follow the bad review ok lor u get a bad exp then u cry wolf,btohqsg
The entire premise of MI is that you get 3 years to do your A levels as a whole,btohqsg
when in fact many ppl go in and do decently to get into a decent course,btohqsg
Not just y2 h1 then y3 focus on h2,btohqsg
Ok not sure why im getting a tiny triggered even though my mi experience was subpar but i feel like thats just misrepresenting MI as a whole,btohqsg
Bro thinks MI bad review means no one gets into uni,btohqsg
I guess rachel you and me can just pack up and leave,btohqsg
those bad reviews about MI mostly from YI students that got nothing better to do,btohqsg
Both also got bad reviews then what you gonna do,btohqsg
Right? Then why so concerned about MI got bad reviews or YI got bad reviews,btohqsg
You go hci or rjc you dont study also 0 rp,btohqsg
those bad reviews dosen't mean anything,btohqsg

I'm telling you that the way the school has structured it basically makes your first year pointless,btohqsg
you are better off retaking o levels and going to a jc,btohqsg
"the ""many people"" are people who had tuition  or took commerce stream",btohqsg
I can tell you for sure that anybody who did well in the science stream got external help,btohqsg
I can tell u for a fact that most of the ppl who are in uni now from my batch didn't get tuition,btohqsg
majority of the top scorers every year are from commerce,btohqsg
I would rlly say it is a matter of choice,btohqsg
