What's inductor cooker? Only heard of induction cooker which uses those metal pans/pots. Didn't know air fryer got multiple types. Don't they just blow hot air? That's all mine does lol.,btohqsg
I'm impressed at the new lunch boxes instead. Comes with battery pack. You can press a button and it heats up the food maybe 30mins in advance. Then your kid can start eating at break time. No need microwave or hot water.,btohqsg
it's just another type of toaster... totally different from air fryer,btohqsg
Air fryers and convection ovens are similar in that they both use a fan to circulate hot air  but they have some key differences.Air fryers cook food via convection baking  while convection ovens use an oven's built-in heating mechanism to heat and blow air around with a fan that's often located on the back or side of the oven.While air frying is designed to be the most powerful  most convection ovens now even offer an air fry setting  which often uses a unique heating system with a larger and faster fan.The smaller size of the air fryer allows it to heat up faster and cook food quicker than a full-sized oven. Additionally  air fryers often include a drip tray to collect any excess oil or moisture  reducing the amount of fat and calories you end up consuming.,btohqsg
this is not an air fryer,btohqsg
"Ahh yes makes sense. That describes my air fryer accurately. Didn't know there were other ""types"". The oven part is true as well. Mine has 2 fans",btohqsg
