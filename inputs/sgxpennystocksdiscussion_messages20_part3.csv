It's a different story if SIA got a govt bailout in another form..But a rights issue is severely dilutive,btohqsg
Besides I personally am not very impressed with the management..for example..the amount of losses on fuel hedging is quite impressive..,btohqsg
SATS should have greater potential than SIA if you believe that Singapore would continue to remain an air hub,btohqsg
Besides they could venture into other businesses like local catering etc,btohqsg
Earning?I thought they losing money now,btohqsg
What I mean is..Even if they eventually start making$.. eps and dividend will remain v low due to dilution from rights,btohqsg
Maybe we should have blue chip stock discussion group ha2...,btohqsg
A few mths after rights n bonds issued  already half the money gone,btohqsg
They are really bad at spending,btohqsg
Let me steal 3mins from you,btohqsg
Who is fella sitting in the balcony of his condo and smoking a cigar?,btohqsg
Just that he talk very slow,btohqsg
Oh!  This stock has good potential as long as Covid-19 vaccine i still in progress. Good  base purely on fundamentals.,btohqsg
Hi  sis and bro  need ur advise. Are saxo also have contra t+2? Normally I use Dbsv. Thanks,btohqsg
Yes! If based purely on Fundamentally wise is good  but technical doesn’t reflect so... but now we know as said by donald trump  vaccine will be out only April  hope the share price will start to go up again,btohqsg
Bro Kit Whye Chan is good in FA. It's good to have him join the group. Newbies can learn from him.,btohqsg
Owned by Taiwanese and they are American citizens,btohqsg
Anyone use TD? Is it safe to deposit huge amount at 1 go? Like 200k?,btohqsg
Medtecs should achieve 15 cts USD EPS or 20 cts SGD for FY2020. At current share price (S$1.07)  I think it is cheap with PE at 5.4.  The uncertainty is whether the company is generous to increase its dividend payout next year.,btohqsg
MT possible give bonus issue and partly dividend instead of fully dividend ?,btohqsg
Anything is possible. Its free float is more than 90% and share outstanding close to 550 million. Its executive team don’t hold much of the shares.  In this case  higher dividend payout may also be possible.,btohqsg
Yes cheers. Good to have him here,btohqsg
Likely oppositeIf management don’t hold much shares then probably no incentive to give higher dividend. Clement is controlling but not much too,btohqsg
If I am management and have not much stake and hence no incentive to give back to shareholders (generally speaking not referring to Mt)I will keep as much cash as possible then do diversification etc.My remuneration is based on performance of company. I taking risk unnecessarily and if bets pay off I get rewarded. If not then too bad I don’t lose anything. Sad for shareholders,btohqsg
Depends on whether MT has a dividend policy,btohqsg
Agree...not in the best interests of mgmt if they do not own so many shares themselves. They are just working executives with some shares,btohqsg
Gambling with shareholder $ in a way,btohqsg
They are not heavily vested in MT and no need to sell off their meagre holdings. Quite surprised that the free float is 90%.,btohqsg
the purchase of shares by director’s wife is a positive indication of confidence,btohqsg
For a mere $23.5k or something? That is pittance  imo. She just have 1 less Hermes bag...lol,btohqsg
Could it be Taiwanese also manipulating so Low that the wife standby to buy ?,btohqsg
Buy...also must buy by the millions to show solid support mah.$23k thereabouts in whatever currency investment in a counter - am sure our investors here invest more than this amt!!,btohqsg
See TG - when price collapsed  coy pumped in funds to prop up the TG price 👍 Solid  man,btohqsg
I think she also dunno how to read market - got excess $$ just buy and declare. Now come out - blue black,btohqsg
think it is 10k at 1.50  10k at 1.35 so $28500 not $23500. can confirm?,btohqsg
Very true. It is a dilemma. Its NAV per share is so low. Without enticing shareholders with good dividend  very difficult for the shares to move higher unless big fund start to take notice  and more analysts come in with buy calls.,btohqsg
Exact details - not sure...but I know...not many zeros after the last digit  5,btohqsg
"The so-called ""disadvantage"" of a company with a large free float is that there is no strong major shareholders and is just run by highly paid executives. Correct me  if I am wrong...this is just my opinion.If I am an institutional investor  I also want to look at major shareholders commitment - like TG.",btohqsg
MT Projected sales for Q3 and Q4 based on max capacity and prices.,btohqsg
So FY EPS will be > 15 US cent.  Unfortunately MT is listed in Catalist. Should migrate to Main Board.,btohqsg
So the retailer must charge $us$2 per piece maybe,btohqsg
Almost $2 a piece1 box $100At peak here also $50-60,btohqsg
Now not peak Liao. I buy a box if face mask about $25.. and this is consider higher price range .,btohqsg
Pls check European/US/Phil price. Not SG. See where their major market.,btohqsg
Using this now. One box $22.50. My frens say very exp.,btohqsg
Like this china even cheaper right. Why so many mask co still collapse,btohqsg
Dunno who will pay for such price. China is literally world mask producer. Producing so much till newbie manufacturer closing,btohqsg
Someone just plagiarised what you said... he so low low. 😅,btohqsg
Yeap. To me comfort very important. So I use this brand.,btohqsg
Yes many new mask factory in china close shop,btohqsg
