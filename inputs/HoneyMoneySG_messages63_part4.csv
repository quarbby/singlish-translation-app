Hi any 1 to 2 year guaranteed endowment now?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if this is the confirmation of successful enrolment for National Day saving ? Or they will trigger sms ?,btohqsg
Recently  I just signed up for Citi Rewards Card via SingSaver  so I need to make a minimum spend of $500 to get the Welcome Gift.I’d need your clarification before I proceed to make these payments. Are the following online transactions eligible for 10x points?1. Telco Bills - Singtel2. Online Shopping - Shopee3. Food Delivery - FoodpandaI haven’t sign up Amaze Card yet. Since they’re already considered as online transactions  do I still need to pair CRMC + Amaze?By the way  are there any on-going promotions for new user sign up with Amaze? Thanks!,btohqsg
For telco bills only instant payment is considered online. Recurring can put through amaze.For latest amaze referral  refer to link herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/123885,btohqsg
I think TIQ by Etiqa has 3 year plan now 3.4% p.a.✈️ TIQ by Etiqa Code R56612https://hmsg.link/tiq,btohqsg
Just Topup your account asap n check your available balance every week.No further sms.Next step is just observe your available balance drop by earmark amount n get cash gift.,btohqsg
Make sure u keep strictly to tnc. I heard some chats have blame game after failure to qualify.I would strongly advise to interpret the tnc with 100% conservatism. Especially the part where u need to maintain total uob balances above your total 30th June total uob balances by earmark amount. At all times until earmark ends.,btohqsg

Can I ask.. miles transfer to krisflyer normally between $26~$27.. is it worth it?,btohqsg
I see uob or Amex krisflyer is directly don’t need transfer but the miles earned is lesser 😂,btohqsg
Ok jokes aside:1. Uob if u get the visa infinites  the pooled miles can be moved without paying transfer fee2. Citibank ultima also has transfer fee waiver but no miles poolingWorth it if u are able to extract value from those cards benefits vs the annual fee payable. Some say uob visa infinite fee might be Waivable especially the old plastic version.Disclaimer: I have none. All just hearsay.,btohqsg
Pool miles.. you mean get at least 2 of UOB miles card  then if let’s say visa infinite don’t need transfer fees and uob lady need transfer fees  I just transfer miles from uob lady to uob visa infinite?,btohqsg
ultima is $4 200 annual fee? transfer miles is $25 each time?,btohqsg
3.65% is guaranteed.. another 0.27% non-guaranteed,btohqsg
But I can’t apply for uob infinite as income not met 😅,btohqsg
Pooled means all in one uob container. U transfer using uob infinite will take from that one container.No need transfer anything,btohqsg
As said if u can find value in ultima  yes.We have been shown a whale “save” eur7k by booking 2nd night free hotel room.,btohqsg
To add. Such benefits are very good for business trip people.First night company pays. U self extend business trip.Your second night is free.They also have free companion airfare. Same trick works too.,btohqsg
