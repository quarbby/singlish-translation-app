"datz why lor..how i count also can't get their figure..hahahae-statement also not ready yet..but won't show their ""workings"" also i guesd",btohqsg
Minimally also should get 147.94 la.. üòÖ that's like 18 days if they don't count Nov 11..,btohqsg
How you count more? You counted 30 days? Another qn is  your account also freshly opened on Nov 11 right? Not before that.,btohqsg
oh shit..opened on 8..haha...so 3 days kosong,btohqsg
Okay calculated but what you got was still lower  so might need to check with CSO.23 days opened (8 to 30)  but only deposited 100k on 11 (so 20 days with 100k).MAB is about just a bit less than 87k.Your interest should be $148.26. So about $2.70 more than what you got.,btohqsg
Revolut rates are not as good during the weekends and MYR is not one of the currencies in the wallet so kinda cannot change money beforehand and keep it.YouTrip rates are great throughout but funds are stuck inside so I cannot empty out the wallet anytime I want to.Wise is the best out there with great rates but they impose a fee that lowers the overall exchange rate  in some cases making the rates worse than Revolut  YouTrip or iChange.I tend to go for Trust  mainly because the rates are  on average  acceptable with the flexibility of liquidity. These are just my opinions  no right  no wrong. üòÖ,btohqsg
To add on for Wise  certain balances can opt in for interest bearing‚Ä¶ so helps to offset fees too  which is amazing.,btohqsg
I consistently get excellent rates from Wise. Trust card being not a multi currency wallet is a mega disadvantage  because this means one cannot lock in the good exchange rates when they are available.,btohqsg
The key to using Wise  Revolut  Youtrip is not to treat them like bank accounts - so not advisable to keep large amts of funds inside,btohqsg
For my remaining funds in Youtrip  I simply use them to take public transport  go grocery shopping etc. its just like a loaded ezlink card,btohqsg
Hi  Did you receive the interest in two transactions? First transaction is the base interest 0.005% and 2nd transaction is the bonus interest?The $145.52 is for your bonus interest.,btohqsg
If you are setting up giro payment for your hsbc card to deduct from your EGA account  you can just contact them on chat in hsbc app and they will set up for you. For the rest  need to download the forms,btohqsg
True  being able to lock exchange rates when favourable is a massive advantage. Wise has almost every currency in the world as stored value  which is even better.While they charge a very small fee  in some cases  when including the fees as part of the cost  the overall exchange rate may not be good.,btohqsg
And must also keep track of large values  due to certain regulations and limits imposed by MAS. üòÖ,btohqsg
The main disadvantages are no perks  no points  no cashbacks etc‚Ä¶ for YouTrip and Wise  if I‚Äôm not wrong. Revolut gives cashbacks but they have a subscription fee model.,btohqsg
DBS Woman‚Äôs World Card^ Charge a minimum of S$15 000 or S$25 000 each year to DBS Woman‚Äôs Card or DBS Woman‚Äôs World Card respectively to receive the annual fee waiver for the following year. If the minimum spend criteria is not met or if the Card is cancelled within each year of the Principal Cardmember‚Äôs Card opening date  the annual fee will be imposed.Anyone knows does it mean that 1st yr fee will not be waived n i have to pay annual fee for this card if i dont charge $25k?,btohqsg
Anyone received iChange physical card already ? Waited very long Liao,btohqsg
Cso say need to wait for 1 month and above,btohqsg

How about UoB evol  easy to waive af?,btohqsg
Daily average balance for the month=100k√ó20/23=86956.52(30 000√ó0.0195+30 000√ó0.0295+16 956.52√ó0.0495)√ó23√∑365=$145.52you should have base interest $86956.52√ó0.0005√ó23√∑365=$2.74 also,btohqsg
Waiting for 3 weeks already. Msg their help center they just say wait. Cannot find out anything. So can only use the virtual card for now. I guess price to pay to endure through a new startup while wanting to enjoy very good rates.,btohqsg
Ya me too no News message and call in vain,btohqsg
oic..thanks for advise bro..u better than CSO..haha,btohqsg
so i excluded that 3 days..no wonder..really thanks for help!kk..now i know how to keep track liaothank for the workings too..doubt even CSO will advise me liddis..haha,btohqsg
Easy to waive even if few transactions. They state 3 transactions a month  any amount.,btohqsg
Seems like the update for HSBC doesn't affect buying plane tickets. Heymax shows that SIA has a MCC of 3075,btohqsg

Hi all  current have CRMC (Amaze) + CPM. But my monthly spendings are over $1k now.Looking to get another specialised card. Would you guys suggest HSBC Revolution or UOB Lady‚Äôs? Taking sign on bonus  annual fees  transfer fees  and travel-spend eligibility into account‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I got HSBC Revolution as my Secondary Card. Since it's very versatile and covers most everyday spending  you can use it for food  shopee  department stalls  grab and plane tickets. Plus  there is no annual fee.UOB Lady gives higher miles (6MPD) but is way too restrictive. You will need to spend time to make sure that the shop is the correct MCC.Furthermorr  the 6MPD is a promotion and will revert back to 4MDP next year. The only scenario I think is useful is that you spend a big bulk on Food or on Air Tickets regularly.,btohqsg
I guess the downside to HSBC revolution is the high transfer fee?,btohqsg
What about UOB Lady‚Äôs vs UOB Privimiles?,btohqsg
Oh yes that's a downside haha,btohqsg
General question - any way we can purchase apple App Store credits for in app purchases from physical store?,btohqsg
Yes and slightly shorter expiry. It still complements well crmc due to travel inclusion though due to support of travel MCCs (with some upcoming changes soon),btohqsg
Hi all! Anyone knows why hsbc revolution didn‚Äôt give me $1k tour travel booking points but uob lady card did? I‚Äôve checked on max for mcc and it‚Äôs 4722,btohqsg
iTunes gift card from iStudio(seems discontinued),btohqsg
Ah ok  that works too. Thanks Chris! (Want a nice MCC for my card) üòÜ,btohqsg
u waited till end of next calendar month for bonus points to be credited? did paywave/online?,btohqsg
Personally  I don't think it's worth looking at Privi Miles unless you have super high monthly spend consistently.Spend | Lady | Privi$1000 | 6000 m | 1400m$5000 | 7600 m | 7000m$6000 | 8000 m | 8400m,btohqsg
I would say only consider Privi Miles after you have max out CRMC + HSBC + UOB Lady,btohqsg
Thanks! Haha hoping to get the $350 sign on bonus,btohqsg
I see! Cause they gave me points for my other spendings but didn‚Äôt give for that  I thought it didn‚Äôt go through hahaha. Thanks will wait till end of calendar month,btohqsg
Userorifnhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:do not post referral clink,btohqsg
Just a update  whole sg no more itunes card for sales in store  think ban from sales like google play due to the prevelance of scam due to gift card,btohqsg
