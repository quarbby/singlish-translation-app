No la is just mainly you gotta form the links  to your personal experience... and make sure its logical.,btohqsg
It's hard for people to tell you how to do it  but perhaps you can write and ask people to read it... haha,btohqsg
E.g. if question is on say fast fashion  then you can bring in things you observe or you urself did what. Like E.g. you also have done it before    but then talk about what emotions/motivations behind you - and perhaps find some point in here that's worth discussing  doing so.,btohqsg
So it's not like personal experience ain't valid  just if there's societal trend it'll be stronger? But on that note I think if you are a good writer  a hybrid would be better... {but note i ain't a gp expert} so take everything i say with a bit of doubt thks HAHAHA,btohqsg
