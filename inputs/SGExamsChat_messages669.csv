I prefer 1 class 1 combi (but not that it helped in bonding),btohqsg
for dhs fmath is single digit ppl take so its PCM + PFM and i think that class alot of ppl not doing econs,btohqsg
My class literally 5 cliques dun cross-interact,btohqsg
isn't this usually the case for common combis?,btohqsg
mines basically 3 cliques don't rly cross interact,btohqsg
Except for trauma bonding over gp,btohqsg
thats if you take the vanilla ones lol,btohqsg
did your class also try to bond as a class and then eventually give up,btohqsg
my class i have one friend but we take diff contrasting subjects,btohqsg
Wait andrea which combi you took,btohqsg
Im not sure but i heard vj is alphabet or sth,btohqsg
my class got another bcmh but is BCmH,btohqsg

Yea for PCMe / BCMe it takes full classes  idk how my batch had 2 classes of CMEp and how did i ended up in the 1st class (but turned our L1R5 didn’t matter at all and tell nth),btohqsg
i think im the only 4h2 student in my class,btohqsg
vj split us according to l1r5 and ip gpa 💀,btohqsg
My class was full class of CMEp,btohqsg
for the 2x series most of the classes are pcme only,btohqsg
except for my class and 210,btohqsg
I heard my bro is S301/2,btohqsg
i recall you saying you were,btohqsg
my class was the lower few classes with l1r5 8-10 and gpa 3.8 and below,btohqsg
Cuz my batch is until 210 all Phys math,btohqsg
Did they Inc class size or smth,btohqsg
the 4x series classes are big,btohqsg
My batch hv until 415 and 502 also,btohqsg
so for assembly you will see the seating plan,btohqsg
My batch is 401-403 then 411-412,btohqsg
granted there are only 2 classes for the 4x series,btohqsg
My class hv 2 rows also,btohqsg
So only got 401 and 411?,btohqsg

my class has 26 about half ip half jae,btohqsg
My class 3 ppl came back to retake As,btohqsg

Is hybrid going down down down,btohqsg
my batchmate was in a class with only 2 JAEs,btohqsg

"Another kind of ppl i hate is those after things starting to fk up say ""ik it from the start  i just didnt say""",btohqsg
But RI ppl are smart  doesnt mean good character,btohqsg
My GP went from D to B,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg

"then that guy said ""im __ and im proud of promoting to y5""blud stole my line 😭😭",btohqsg
forgot the 9 in front of the 0,btohqsg
idk im not in any of his servers,btohqsg
i would nvr say this in the discord because no one would give genuine advice and luna would def say there was something romantic between us (which is one of the main reasons why we stopped being friends btw),btohqsg
My friend managed to get a similar distinction rate in his tuition as her with a $20/hr business,btohqsg
when blud cant differentiate between a shitpost and a genuine remark,btohqsg
Bro idk why it's in his headcannon that u failed a levels,btohqsg
does he really believe you got S U for ur alvls,btohqsg
Does retaking mean fail a levels,btohqsg
because it fits his narrative what,btohqsg
They clowned bedok for being Na,btohqsg
He just randomly brought bedok up,btohqsg
It says I haven't verify my number yet,btohqsg
the discord is so weird tho like,btohqsg
they somehow clown people for being NA but shit on people for being elitist,btohqsg
no because NA they clown. IP they also clown,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
Basically u cannot be too good u cannot be too shit,btohqsg
Cuz rhey say I didn't verify my number,btohqsg
it’s ok it’s probs better that you can’t,btohqsg
"no is legit very funny how josh is supposedly against elitism but then implies that NA is ""bad""",btohqsg
And make him realise he's contradicting himself,btohqsg
people who take psych usually the ones that need help the most,btohqsg
if he makes it in psychology,btohqsg
B for H2 Math can apply for CS / engineering at all or no chance?,btohqsg
people that enter to look for him gonna come out with more issues,btohqsg
depends what kind of engineering might be possible but CS seems really hard unless you got the portfolio to make up for it,btohqsg
"A lot of people in the discord and reddit seem to have elitist mindsets (fixated with ""top"" jcs) while simultaneously being against the IP stream",btohqsg
i sold my soul to pendulum counting course,btohqsg
where you selling your soul to,btohqsg
chem too good alr so wasted if don't pursue,btohqsg
Why don't people just admit their elitist,btohqsg
later josh make fun of you for being poor,btohqsg
Every school is a good school,btohqsg
being elitist is ok but is those elitist but can't back their shit up,btohqsg
usually those ppl who say elitist things online arent those with 90rp from Ip Jcs,btohqsg
ya bc that's why you can tell they're assholes,btohqsg
actl those 90rp/>85rp from IP jcs the ones i know they are quite nice and humble,btohqsg
and they are friendly to you also,btohqsg
i mean there's obviously outliers where they do well  are elitist but are assholes but,btohqsg
bro it smells like a fking bakery at the back of a bendy bus,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
Sometimes is a self fulfilling prophecy,btohqsg
bc i slowly crawl up from being shit one,btohqsg
"But if you are from a particular sch and say ""X school is so bad  im so shit thats why im here"" then it can become self fulfilling",btohqsg
i mean like hes a floater ah,btohqsg
ehh.. that was me in sec 1 LOL,btohqsg
i wasn't ready for uni when i entered tho,btohqsg
like he dont put in effort,btohqsg
like he think hes doing sth,btohqsg
but just never claimed to have been trying,btohqsg
Rather than deny that their behaviour is not elitist,btohqsg
honestly everyone is elitist in some way or another,btohqsg
but not alot of people would admit it cos its nt sth to be proud of. i mean i honestly wont admit so easily until i think back again,btohqsg
im here just hoping to stay at honors gpa,btohqsg

But ig critically viewing it leh did u think u  did do btr for 2023 GP than 2022 GP,btohqsg
Man I’m so worried I got all B for H2s even tho RP is 80+,btohqsg
cant tell is civil or comp,btohqsg
I’ll just have to retake or smth,btohqsg
I thought grades more impt than RP?,btohqsg
Like I don’t have A for any H2,btohqsg
unless the course itself say must get min grade in certain subjects,btohqsg

on the bright side the onyx house shirt nic,btohqsg
I just know that MI students have like,btohqsg
VERY bad commitment when it comes to track CCA,btohqsg
Though that doesn’t reflect on their personality but,btohqsg
Maybe it displays the overall attitude,btohqsg
im just at the library staring at people training under the sun during their cca,btohqsg
Like the coach was ranting to me about how,btohqsg
So he just standing there like some drunkard who got lost on the campus 😂,btohqsg
how you do anything is how you do everything,btohqsg
Like some people invest a ton of effort in studying,btohqsg
But do the bare minimum for CCA,btohqsg
Can’t say how they behave in CCA is how they behave in the classroom too,btohqsg
But I suppose in this case it really does,btohqsg
oh maybe rules have changed since 2021,btohqsg
lol cause last time MI admission is v cmi,btohqsg
