Anyone knows what is the average time to get your cr dit card approved? I applied for UOB krisflyer 2 months ago and no updates from them other than asking for some documents 1 month ago(1 month after I submitted application). I have booked about 10 flights in this 2 months mostly on scoot but sadly can't get the miles because the card application is taking so long. I had the UOB absolute and I don't remember the application being so long,btohqsg
I applied last nov 13  no update upto now..,btohqsg

any easy way to track your UOB Evol for online and contactless  whether already hit 250?,btohqsg
Uob app ?don't think they will sperate it mostly will show how much,btohqsg
it is able to breakdown into online and contactless?  Oh great!,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL? Donâ€™t think I see it,btohqsg
Most banks don't separate payment to show on statement either online or contactless it just show location date amount so user need to do own Homeworks to record down or use a app lorI record down when I use cards,btohqsg
I mean  there is no tracker for Uob EVOL,btohqsg
Not about the online and mobile,btohqsg
Why not call the bank and ask,btohqsg
