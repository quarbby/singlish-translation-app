do i still need to pay to enter airport lounges even if I have loungekey from cimb world mastercard?,btohqsg
In new to using CC and saw that we are able to access airport lounge if we pay our flight tix using that CC. Is it true?1) is it free?2) if I were to pay for my spouse and child tix using my credit card  are they able to access it also?,btohqsg
356 or amex or any that have airport lounge access.,btohqsg
If cards gives lounge access  its usually free for certain amount of entry. After which is payable.,btohqsg
1) dont remember which cards gives lounge access when paying for tickets. Only know of card giving certain amount of free lounge access everyyear. Example  Dbs altitude gives 2 free lounge access per year2) child can enter also but will also minus givrn quota. Not based on if used card to pay tickets,btohqsg
If you have total 3 pax  either you and your wife each holds on cc that comes with Priority pass  or you can get the DBS vantage card that gives I think 10 passes.,btohqsg
Wow. 10 passes per year? Nice.but have to charge the flight tix to the card?,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you for the explanation,btohqsg
No need. Free 10 entry per membership year from priority pass,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you for the advise guys,btohqsg

I see. I went to read the tnc on cimb world mastercard for lounge access and it says I need to pay to enter so I wasn't sure cause the tnc was from 2021.,btohqsg
Lounge pass doesn't work like that1) The credit card gives you a complimentary invitation code to create a lounge pass account e.g. Priority Pass OR they provide you lounge vouchers e.g. AMEX KFA2) You use the account/vouchers to access the loungeYou don't use the credit card DIRECTLY or get granted access at lounge just because you hit a certain spend or what,btohqsg
Ya.. all my added cards have been removed üò¢,btohqsg
Xnap but this is like a nerf to CRMC cause it via Apple Pay / Google pay,btohqsg
Any alternate way to add back the cards ?,btohqsg

Ah xnap is an app. Will take a look for that. Thanks üëç,btohqsg

It by liquid pay  so you can use xnap on liquid pay accepted merchant QR or xnap QR,btohqsg

Used LP for hawker food  via LP>amaze>CRMC...small way to accumulate miles which would otherwise go to naught..,btohqsg

It was the ICBC Zodiac / Global Travel MC. which offered 12 and 6 lounge passes respectively. But their website doesn't seem to mention it anymore,btohqsg

Cannot use CRMC directly via Xnap QR to earn 10x reward points?,btohqsg
No because CRMC only awards 0.4 mpd for mobile wallet payments,btohqsg
