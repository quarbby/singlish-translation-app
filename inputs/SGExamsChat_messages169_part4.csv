Keep in mind that over half of SG gets distinction for both maths subjects every year,btohqsg
Talk so much math wont improve also,btohqsg
And hence  a bell curve doesnt exist,btohqsg
A and E too I beleef,btohqsg
A bell curve minimises % of As  while increasing % passes,btohqsg
No bell curve but got grade threshold. Which can technically act like a bell curve since the grade threshold can be adjusted to determine the number of A1s,btohqsg
Yup but sadly it seems that bell curve wouldn’t be disclosed for local papers,btohqsg
Can only find those international paper grade threshold,btohqsg
they dw disclose because they'll know people will find pattern recognition and apply in papers that'll lead to misconduct,btohqsg
this one my hist cher that said so who set and marked the papers before said so,btohqsg
But anyway international paper GT for A1 is usually just below 90%,btohqsg
The teacher who scanned it has ginormous balls,btohqsg
I’m guessing it’s roughly the same case here so the A1 here should be in the Low 90s or high 80s,btohqsg
wait so e math easy to pass but hard to a1?,btohqsg
bro i alr did paper 1 and felt miserable,btohqsg
if cant get a1 then go for a2,btohqsg
I Guess you can say that but if no careless mistake A1 should be no problem,btohqsg
as of now i just want to pass lol,btohqsg
so is it easy to pass?,btohqsg
she say papers are made in such a way everyone can do one,btohqsg
It isn’t hard to get at least A2 too,btohqsg
Only A1 slightly difficult in my opinion,btohqsg
So it’s in fact less than half the marks,btohqsg
is this for e math or what,btohqsg
But o level osie econs in Sg uses the international paper,btohqsg
I’m guessing it shouldn’t be much different here the GT,btohqsg
okay so it'll be easy for me to pass e math but hard to get distinction am i rigjt?,btohqsg
i flunk my paper 1  like 45/73 only,btohqsg
It’s by moderation this year not bellcurve,btohqsg
Check Cambridge website ^^ also on straits time’s,btohqsg
dont talk about bellcurve it'll stress you out,btohqsg
i can't study next paper knowing i may not pass math,btohqsg
want to rp also cannot go,btohqsg
Why u dowan share money with pat and xin,btohqsg
"DAE and req for ""okay ill retake paper while in poly""",btohqsg
because i want buy hersheys mcflurry,btohqsg
how about grade boundary? like easier to pass by harder for a1?,btohqsg
Almost all qns must be correct,btohqsg
Those students from top schs will be laughing their ass off heh,btohqsg
They’re just as worried as all of you,btohqsg
Because all of you are overly kiasu,btohqsg
if i just want a c5? possible?,btohqsg
This kind of standard for paper 1  can pass,btohqsg
But idk how to say for paper 2,btohqsg
Paper 2 u can spot what questions already,btohqsg
what did y’all get after comparing d answers,btohqsg
im not even from a top school but im worried cos EVERYONE seems to get all correct too,btohqsg
Guys 17b What if i correct to 3s.f.?,btohqsg
If not my A math how get b3 instead of c6,btohqsg
theres moderation if theres too many a1,btohqsg
