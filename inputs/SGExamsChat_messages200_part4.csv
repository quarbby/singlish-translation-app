So either you can get used to it during PW or u can get culture shocked in the future,btohqsg
When I was doing an internship last year  all the adults have like weekly meeting to discuss plans and what to do and all  similar to PW,btohqsg
yeah  will always meet proj mates you dont like in work too,btohqsg
either you learn to get used to it now,btohqsg
or you suffer in the future,btohqsg
Time to calculate the probability of that happening,btohqsg
money can fall from sky and u dont need to study anymore,btohqsg
Needs to be a substantial amount for that to happen,btohqsg
The 8 is the cut off,btohqsg
Like eg 260 is the current cut off for a sch,btohqsg
So below 8 means can go anywhere,btohqsg
Guys could i ask a question its abt chem,btohqsg
Im just asking out of curiosity,btohqsg
What makes them so god damned stable,btohqsg
but most resonance structures arent as stable as benzene,btohqsg
the single bond adopts partial double-double bond character as a result,btohqsg
I heard the delocalised electrons like spread out the charges or smth,btohqsg
that stabilises the compound in terms of reducing the negative charge,btohqsg
but partially as a result of electron delocalisation the bond order of the bonding regions involved has an intermediate value,btohqsg
Wait so the lower the negative charge the more stable??,btohqsg
Oh yeah it's also why it makes nitrate ions and sulfate ions almost impossible to breakdown in electrolysis right,btohqsg
yes the more stable the compound if it is an anion,btohqsg
lol electrolysis can 'break' nitrate and sulfate meh,btohqsg
Cause nitrate has 2 resonance structures,btohqsg
for me non existence cuz my colleagues nice,btohqsg
but i heard from friends who kena damn bad ones,btohqsg
i dont think the correct word is breakdown,btohqsg
u mean reactive i guess  or oxidised haha,btohqsg
Bruh always confused me so fucking Much kqnfiwnfnebf,btohqsg
but ya tbh thats part of the reason  because their negative charges is extensively dispersed  so they aren't that reactive,btohqsg
but usually for most students they evaluate it in terms of the E knot values to determine reactivity,btohqsg
Ya I am definitely not taking H2 Chemistry,btohqsg
is not as intimidating as u think,btohqsg
tbh apart from physics  both h2 bio and h2 chem honestly don't need much pre-requisites,btohqsg
Ya it's just like any other subject like math,btohqsg
i think even then resonance wldnt rlly explain since electrolysis E nought vales arent fully dependent on stability of reactant / product,btohqsg
gibbs free energy by nernst eqn wld require you to take the other side into account,btohqsg
is impossible to explain all phenomenons,btohqsg
ya  better than staring at a calculator for the rest of my life,btohqsg
Wait ummm just one more question  im sorry im asking so much just interested,btohqsg
if only chem wasnt a central science,btohqsg
ok la but chem also have,btohqsg
i mean all sciences hv bio,btohqsg
Tf does gibbs free energy even fucking mean like okay there's the equation  delta G=delta H-(Temperature*Delta Entropy),btohqsg
defn is energy associated w a chem reaction to do work,btohqsg
Its the free enegy given out by a reaction,btohqsg
that can be used to do work*,btohqsg
Free energy is energy that can do useful work,btohqsg
Hi how do i do this,btohqsg
Which time do i take or do i find average of those timings,btohqsg
