funny story. Volvo gave NK 1000 V70 many years ago but they were never paid,btohqsg
volvo still sends them the bill every year,btohqsg
Volvo needs our debt collector service,btohqsg
Would have been a hit in sg if not for COE. Already pay so much for COE might as well pay another 5-10k to upgrade to japanese brand,btohqsg
Already has 30 000 prelaunch booking 😱,btohqsg
@awj_moodwill be very upset with you,btohqsg
Why are you “Mr Mood” instead of Imran,btohqsg
Yes  that is correct. A convoy of Singapore registered porsches are indeed eyesore to the person recording the video.But they forgotten  these people are going to spend in malaysia and boost their tourism revenue!,btohqsg
So you admit to being the 3rd walking encyclopedia,btohqsg
This place is super crowded in the mornings. If you haven't tried the horginal beef noodle at the same coffershop  can give a shot too. As well as the prawn noodles opposite at block 704,btohqsg
They should host one. Like a mini rally,btohqsg
Beef noodle is legit! I had it the other day when@SGCM_AdminType J wasn’t there,btohqsg
I come from JB to eat at your shop sir,btohqsg
But mounts increase nvh. I would say arbs  endlinks etc etc before going to mounts.And wearing parts of the suspension is the best excuse to upgrade them 😎,btohqsg
i think... you are infected with the zhng virus,btohqsg
confirm use the last excuse go poison everybody,btohqsg
I can neither confirm nor deny -R,btohqsg
Yeah its definitely better than the seremban beef noodles. I had this at their tampines branch  utter disappointment,btohqsg
Legit.Fuel pump spoil? Go stage 2Turbo spoil? Go biggerIntercooler leaking? Go biggerBushings worn? Go PU bushingsSuspension worn? Go coilovers.Except tyresTyres worn? Go drifting first,btohqsg
got a lot of great chefs too,btohqsg
Chef by day  racer by night,btohqsg
Jk my fd can barely overtake bluesg,btohqsg
I dont think it was done in properly manner based on the video. Especially base on safety of road users. I gotta agree with you on the blanking out plate numbers as its for safety for the drivers.I've followed convoys before. Indeed we are connected by walkies. But that doesnt mean safety is not priority and also behaving in their road also is priority to protect our sg image when in their country. Obviously it is a 2 way road  convoy and also watch the road limit. Anyway whats the rush. Unless convoy on the N.S. highway.,btohqsg
As long not double white line,btohqsg
"There's always eyesore between two countries. But the actions on their road just will make us singaporeans look bad. We dont need to use such superiority words like ""going over  good business for msia"" and for what ? We need them to cross bother to de-stress too.",btohqsg
i thought that was a phase,btohqsg
But my mazda 3 giving problem,btohqsg
gg too little subaru to measure,btohqsg

@Emily_WozniakHi there  pls refrain from making insensitive and rude racial remarks-R,btohqsg
The smell of gasoline after a cold start,btohqsg
I actually went to google ABCDEFG,btohqsg
That’s truly maturity thinking. Which is why I find it offensive and immature to say such thing that Malaysia needs Sinkies to go there for shipping. How about Malaysians saying what good is your flashy sports cars when you you can’t use it in singapore,btohqsg
A boy can do everything for a girl?,btohqsg
Dont mention it  I am still lost. LMAO,btohqsg
Psst don’t forget the 4.6L stroker … 😉😉,btohqsg
Don’t waste your brain cells over this. Urban dictionary is random one.,btohqsg
Thank you sir. Lucky my skin is thickish and don’t feel hurt so easily but 🫡 you!,btohqsg
So early you start your rickshaw,btohqsg
But the second mice gets the cheese,btohqsg
