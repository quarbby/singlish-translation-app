Hi   does anyone know how I can apply for the  schemes eg. Married child scheme  ftpmc scheme when I am ballotting for bto?,btohqsg
It should be automatically applied if you're eligible,btohqsg
Called hdb and they told me it's not auto. Needy apply :(,btohqsg
Oh sorry I misread your question!! 😱 when you apply for the BTO there will be a portion on this. So you need to fill it in,btohqsg
Does that tally with what the officer said?,btohqsg
MCPS need to apply. FT(PMC) don't need.in essence  schemes with strings attached will need applicants to explicitly indicate interest. because you shld not be forced to commit to sth you aren't willing to  e.g. parents cannot move out of 4km radius for MCPS.for FT(PMC)  your family nucleus is alr like that and there are no other strings  so you are auto enrolled in it.,btohqsg

Hello! Based on this restriction  if i have Q no within supply for May BTO  planning to skip Oct BTO. Will I be able to apply for Dec BTO?,btohqsg
yes  confirm* can apply for dec 2023 BTO. rule of thumb is the new regulations do not apply to any launches before oct 2023* the only scenarios which you won't be able to apply for dec 2023 BTO are (a) you're a second-timer now and you reject a chance to select between now and dec  and this is your second rejection  or (b) you purchase another property e.g. resale,btohqsg
