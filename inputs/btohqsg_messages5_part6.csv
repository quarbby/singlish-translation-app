the second timers one even more dramatic...,btohqsg
17 FT fights for every 4r unit of TB,btohqsg
aiya want best seaview  aim for GSWF instead,btohqsg
since the golf course plot would be demolished for GSWF right,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just wondering for Macpherson Weave  will the noise pollution from paya lebar airbase be very bad?,btohqsg
Thanks for all.that's difficult to be success,btohqsg
by the time you moved in MW  just lun for another 2 or 3 years of the sound of freedom,btohqsg
yeah but I find it ok,btohqsg
to me lah  unbearable to others,btohqsg
242 family  fight for 1 unit  so popular,btohqsg
but just wondering how bad it'll be hahaha,btohqsg
if i have to at least stay there for about 4 years before PLAB move out,btohqsg
I don't find it that bad actually  if you're answering a phone call while a fighter plane flew past  can just make full use of your bomb shelter  the sound will be much minimized,btohqsg
one flies past  a few others follow  so it's like a couple of minutes disruption,btohqsg
OK don't take tb please  if you want good seaview  skarli you only enjoy a couple of years of the view,btohqsg
because the golf course plot converted to high rise buildings,btohqsg
True  I go for mountain ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Mountain ah  tengah is nearer la,btohqsg
Really? I will go and check,btohqsg
nearer as in compare with other projects under this launch,btohqsg
you want mountain  then try apply for SBF at bukit batok,btohqsg
Does anyone have any idea roughly how much it is to hack down the wall. My kitchen is close concept because i took SBF but i am planning to make it open concept,btohqsg
No issue unless WFH. Been staying at Dakota all along and it has only bothered me recently. Past 20 plus years I didn't find it annoying ðŸ˜‚ but recently when I'm home it does bother me when it goes on continuously,btohqsg
my sister hacked her kitchen wall for 1k (idk why so ex),btohqsg
i see that place like abit dark and ulu leh lol,btohqsg
Can I ask if the woodgrove application allowed you to apply for the married child scheme?,btohqsg
have u been around the area? lol,btohqsg
I have go tat place  but look ok for us.,btohqsg
not only this  must seek approval from HDB,btohqsg
For elderly apply sbf never indicate first or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
1) For Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) a) do we have to call/write in to HDBorb) is there an option for us to choose during flat application processorc) do they already have automated system in place to do the check?2) Does it matter if the one is main or sub applicant?,btohqsg
are there any telegram group for the macpherson weave project? pls pm me  thanks!,btohqsg
If you have a child  automatically hdb system will consider. Only need to key in when you have a child on the way soon which you can enter delivery date...,btohqsg
it has actually the 2nd lowest ratio besides tengah 4r,btohqsg
maybe below my expectation for such ratio,btohqsg
I reckon kovan will fare with higher ratio,btohqsg
and with pricing pegged to non mature estate,btohqsg
Also coz fewer mature estate units this round compared to prev two rounds,btohqsg
hmm the ratio of MW is quite underwhelming,btohqsg
is it because it is so near to industrial estates,btohqsg
Still have many days to go,btohqsg
Why tengar 2 rooms no taker for sbf  application rate very low. 110 apply for  689 units  application rate only 0.2% only.I thru normally single applicants will grap the 2room 99 year unit.,btohqsg
One friend of mine apply 10 over time just to get a 2 room at sengkang as single applicant.,btohqsg
tengah is like west of paya lebar on the Singapore map,btohqsg
broke dakota one record of 14.8,btohqsg
potential ratio to be hit  35 for FT,btohqsg
yes yes definitely  normal units already strike toto lol,btohqsg
but I reckon the profit margin not as good as pinnacle duxton if the cooling measures kick in someday,btohqsg
so it's not good for home owners if they are not staying for good,btohqsg
700k  still can sell at a million  should be easy peasy,btohqsg
