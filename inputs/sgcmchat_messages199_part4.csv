no leh  probably within the past decade?,btohqsg
that's a surprise cause the diesel kangoo's K9K is extremely reliable,btohqsg
especially the one i have which is the 3rd gen engine on the gen 2 facelift kangoo,btohqsg
his was the 2nd gen one,btohqsg
same engine you get in an A180d,btohqsg
they're very sensitive to poor maintenance,btohqsg
bearings will shit the bed if you don't keep up with oil changes,btohqsg
bought brand new  2nd month in jibaboom,btohqsg
the other problem being  if you're the kind to use tap water in the expansion tank  the oil cooler will corrode internally and mix oil and water,btohqsg
he probably got the car built between friday and monday,btohqsg
i take care of over 20 kangoos,btohqsg
they're all gen 2 facelift LWBs,btohqsg
the QC is really bad especially when it comes to things like door alignment,btohqsg
the thing ships with barn doors that don't close properly,btohqsg
they rub on each other and there's a gap where water comes in when it rains,btohqsg
there's also weird ones where the door cards aren't mounted correctly then you get funny lumps in the plastic,btohqsg
tbf the french rub each other often too,btohqsg
the engines have been good though,btohqsg
so far none have required a motor replacement,btohqsg
although 3 have gone in for blowing the oil coolers but that's a maintenance problem,btohqsg
idiots putting water in the system instead of coolant,btohqsg
2  have blown their plastic charge pipes,btohqsg
and i need a clutch master cos there's a batch problem where the o rings disintegrate and you get a 1mm biting point,btohqsg
truly a french thing to do,btohqsg
there are truly a lot of quirks,btohqsg
for example the aircon that turns into a block of ice while you drive,btohqsg
so you suddenly get zero airflow,btohqsg
first car sure 3 series touring,btohqsg
