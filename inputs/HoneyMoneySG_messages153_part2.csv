Hello  any DCS card promo for new member ?,btohqsg
So far what I saw is it was announced by influencers? I visited Chocolate website today  it is updated with tie up info. No announcement from Heymax yet. Correct?,btohqsg
DCS got bad reputation imo  extremely difficult to get to their customer service. That time 1 year ago I want to cancel my donki DCS card  called more than 10 times to reach their customer service. The lady explain they were undergoing some reorganization hence no manpower. Imagine if ur card got fraud or wrong transactions can’t find ppl how,btohqsg
Yes it is announced on Chocolate Finance website  which to me is official enough.,btohqsg

Hi Jasmine  sry for digging up old post. Can I check whether it is only UOB that requires this enrollment step? How about other banks like Citi  DBS  HSBC  etc.?,btohqsg
As far as i rem  there's no enrollment forms for the 3 banks that you mentioned. You just key in your KF number when you do the transfer.,btohqsg
Around 6k for pc and maybe potential 2k for monitor.,btohqsg
The monitor might not be that soon but the PC is more or less confirmed. Just have to see how this month expenses are first. But would like to get some info beforehand,btohqsg
I just bought something using grab paylater. Is the purchase excluded from the spend count from uob one card?,btohqsg
Fingers crossed.. its almost 14 feb..,btohqsg
What cards do you already have? And where are you getting ur pc/monitor from?,btohqsg
Depends on how much you trust chocolate finance.,btohqsg
Where Grab paylater deduct the money from? Grab wallet or Credit card ?,btohqsg
Excluded. Grab PayLater is basically Grab Wallet top-up.,btohqsg

Just to check if anyone knows like if I still have giro arrangements for tax payment. Can I adhoc pay a particular month payment via axs using chocolate card without cancelling my giro plan?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82IHave a look. But then don't force spend,btohqsg
