if you think you won't live for long or 'dont trust gahmen' etc  you 'lost' the $8000 you topped up to save this hypothetical $1.2k from tax,btohqsg
"yeah  lets assume I am neutral towards all of those  and no blackswan events. I don't understand why chris talks about being unable to sheild  its not all ""lost"" right?",btohqsg
But if you are planning to live for long and fully use the expected CPF LIFE payouts as part of your retirement planning  then yup it may be still a good choice in that manner,btohqsg
like okay  he topped up 40k  lets assume 10%  means he has saved 4k over the years right? so this 4k he could have reinvested in other things (or even say ssb or t bills) and it just means that his 40k in cpf OA won't be eligible for 4% P.A because of the locked up funds in SA,btohqsg
uhmmm okay but still asking in the context of the video though,btohqsg
I may be wrong but  I think the video's assumption is that the viewers do not want money locked up in CPF LIFE but rather be able to withdraw as much as possible at 55yo,btohqsg
wait the RSTU goes into SA  not OA  so the 40k still gets 4% p.a.,btohqsg
hmm ok maybe i rewatch the video again later then  he didn't specifically talk about CPF life withdraw  just about CPF shielding,btohqsg
CPF Shielding is to prevent the SA/OA funds from being locked up in RA (aka CPF LIFE) at 55yo,btohqsg

Content of the month: What happens after you survived a layoff (TikTok)TikTok overtook Instagram to become my Rank #3 media platform. I have to thank their superior algorithm (& Chew Shou Zi) to recommend the content to viewers who haven‚Äôt discovered my content yet. I saw a slowdown in both YouTube views and subscribers. Perhaps more people are returning to work from office and less time to consume long form videos (as evidently seen in hawker centres where it is much more difficult to find seat during lunchtime than in 2022). Nevertheless  business revenue is not on downtrend (for now) so I am thankful for that.Upcoming: Instagram Reels does not seem as hyped as before. I will prefer to put more work on Images than Reels if I want to grow on Instagram. But for now  TikTok seems more promising on media growth. I am also aiming to complete my ACCM Course materials by May 2023  and I learnt so much back from the Private Circle as well.Statistics Update: Apr 2023Years Active: 2 years  3 monthsYou can also support me for $0 by clicking on my Interactive Brokers Referral Link athttps://hmsg.link/ibkr  which pays a few pennies to my business.üé¶ YouTube:https://youtube.com/c/HoneyMoneySGüì° Telegram:https://t.me/honeymoneysgüì∑ Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/honeymoneysgü§≥ TikTok:https://www.tiktok.com/@honeymoneysgüìô Advanced Credit Card Mastery Course:https://hmsg.link/accm,btohqsg
