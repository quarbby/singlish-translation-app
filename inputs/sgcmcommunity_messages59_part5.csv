eh give me the 4.2L and I'd be a very happy boy too,btohqsg
just get the 4.2L  then change the badge to read 5.0L on the car,btohqsg
normal people can't tell anyways kekekek,btohqsg
The 4.2 has rhe same bhp as an e9x m3,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA itâ€™s not illegal until police come,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why car meet must hush hush leave before the chaos,btohqsg
im quite sure M3 drives better round the corner,btohqsg
Okay lah never driven either but,btohqsg
The r8 looks lower and wider,btohqsg
or at least feels way too heavy,btohqsg
where is our mr x when we need him,btohqsg
hahahaha i should he careful about what i wish for,btohqsg
depends on weight balance and geometry of suspension,btohqsg
R8 likes to understeer and cannot take weight shift well,btohqsg
But I feel the v8 m3 sounds better ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
wah that day I heard a Merc SLS,btohqsg
Would love to try the cayman too,btohqsg
reminded me of one F1 years back when it was the safety car.,btohqsg
so happy to see and hear it go around when safety car out,btohqsg
i think starting to go down,btohqsg
i know someone that owns SLS,btohqsg
show stopper and damn it sounds amazing,btohqsg
Cs3 is the way to go now,btohqsg
Miss Mr X hor..... he would say it is a girl's car and how fugly it is.,btohqsg
911 is every petrolheads dream car,btohqsg

yes. good performance and very reasonably priced too.,btohqsg
you kidding? if it's on SGCM  it must be good!!!!,btohqsg
i am curious.. why back seats new when usually it's the front seats which take the most wear and tear,btohqsg
Sure can buy  ex or not only,btohqsg
Ya hor did not think of it,btohqsg
PPI carefully lor... $17K like a bit high to me.  this kind of car you want to buy and hopefully just drive till the end without further major maintenance events.  GB  water pump and tyres checked so it is good for sure.,btohqsg
If you want 2 years remaining coe car  personally won't recommend german makes,btohqsg
Get a reliable altis or mazda 3,btohqsg
Go with japanese workhorse can't go wrong one,btohqsg
Buy german be prepared to pay through the nose for wear and tear,btohqsg
not bad but gearbox change alr ah hahaha,btohqsg
even jap car will break down  what more conti haha,btohqsg
The more feature u have the higher the chance of break down,btohqsg
