CONCLUSIONUltimately  whether interest rates are rising or falling does not seem to be the key driver of REIT performance over medium- and long-term periods.  Rather  the more important dynamics to address are the underlying factors that drive rates higher.  If interest rates are rising due to strength in the underlying economy and inflationary activity  stronger REIT fundamentals may very well outweigh any negative impact caused by rising rates.,btohqsg
