The key issues AsiaOne really need to ask in its research is the concept of zero down/full loans (should not have been glossed over) and worse  practise of “over loans” (loans above asset values) and the impact of it. It should not be legal but so far I have not seen a single court case being brought up.,btohqsg
How can there be court cases when the people taking over loans were ‘informed’ when they did it. Not so much know what their doing. Don’t think there’s any laws surrounding over loans is there? Guess the question is  who’d sue them for it haha,btohqsg
Not familiar with local laws but thought full loan technically wasn’t. Haiyah but what would rickshaw pullers know,btohqsg
