If im seeing things right  the Agera S+ Medusa owner just got a Huayra BC in purple,btohqsg
So dk will be in SG annot.,btohqsg
No more medusa in sg 💔,btohqsg
no more marathons at future cnk n mw😀,btohqsg
no more zombies and tree climbing...,btohqsg
maybe he got fed up with spotters and left,btohqsg
More likely he just sold and export,btohqsg
Cars like these don't depreciate  they appreciate in value as time goes by and numbers get smaller (crashes  totaled etc),btohqsg
running for mid cars is insane,btohqsg
who wanna see me nutting over my 1:64 f40,btohqsg
yo lemme get ur ig u funny asl😭🙏,btohqsg
how old even r u bruh😭🙏,btohqsg
Tfw I can't afford a mid car 😭,btohqsg
but you have a great car,btohqsg
cos seeing he has his new huayra or zonda,btohqsg
pic with his other koenigsegg also,btohqsg

he alw park at the corner,btohqsg
I rmb last time at lengkok bahru there alw got like one green Lambo,btohqsg
the plate is so the 69,btohqsg
Nah i got a car I wanna share but it's from Japan  it's a friend's,btohqsg
So if we strictly keep it SG only I'll refrain to avoid confusion,btohqsg
I’m a jap car exporter and I post my adverts here also hahaha,btohqsg
I still got one of this but in red same spec 🤞,btohqsg
He's name is allen  u can find him on insta as@onbail,btohqsg
Singapore car scene really dying eh,btohqsg
passed by this in the morning :o,btohqsg
Its just the culture when overseas content creators actually do that method but they included printed images and shit and put on people's car but when sg people do they don't understand the culture before doing that,btohqsg
can i shameless plug your ass,btohqsg
I've seen him do that before,btohqsg
Some guys I've meet are super open to have their cars taken,btohqsg
Really depends on luck ah I guess,btohqsg
neil is the guy who made this paper lol,btohqsg
ya some others want hide car also 🤣,btohqsg
he deleted his tiktok account after being posted on cbdivision,btohqsg
Feel bad for the poor kid. He only 13 😭,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure he's in almost everyone's car zombie videos,btohqsg
like when a crowd of ppl follow behind a supercar,btohqsg
like the koenigsegg and pagani during cnk,btohqsg
just curious  what's with the negative connotations behind people running after vehicles at cnk,btohqsg
i see stuff like that happen daily,btohqsg
More like please don't do it because it's not safe,btohqsg
interesting  saw quite a number of aunties running after a bus today,btohqsg
wonder if they think about their personal safety too,btohqsg
guys I lwk crashed out from obs,btohqsg
I am not really into this type of scene. But what exactly did he do wrong here?,btohqsg
I understand where yall coming from about this but i feel so bad 😭😭,btohqsg
Dude was just tryna shoot his shot,btohqsg
Dn to go until this extent la,btohqsg
everytime i see your car i worry about my personal safety,btohqsg
I mean  it's kinda unsafe too cause there are other cars around,btohqsg
as someone that drives to cnk i can't state how irritating it is to see kids blocking the whole road ignorant to other cars lol,btohqsg
but observe your surroundings and be more self aware,btohqsg
I dunno the letter tone was respectful. If this was delivered in a public space and not mysteriously appearing at their home is there an issue,btohqsg
see who can run faster for their tiktoks,btohqsg
this kid nearly ran into my car while chasing some supercar once. really fucking stupid.,btohqsg
