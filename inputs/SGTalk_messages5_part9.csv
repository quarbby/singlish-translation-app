Hi guys. I lost my gold necklace 2 days ago. Rather short and thin necklace just nice for the neck. Last seen location was at greenridge 606 tampines st 61. Also been to sam leong rd  anchorvale and jalan kayu as i was doing some delivery. It was a gift from my late grandma so if anyone found it please return it to me and i will reward you for your efforts.,btohqsg
Wow. Is it valuable? Guess u can make a police report if u have the pic,btohqsg
I remember there is one case somebody dropped a iPhone. One fella took it and failed to return or make police report. Then law caught up on him.,btohqsg
