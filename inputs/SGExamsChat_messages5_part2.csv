not if they are MOE JCTIP quality,btohqsg
Quite unrecommended by MOE I believe they advise a ratio like 1:15-20,btohqsg
I have never attended tuition but I heard some tuition centre produce straight As,btohqsg
Have you actually considered giving tuition,btohqsg
its called 'riding on the coat-tails of other's hard efforts',btohqsg
Thatâ€™s impossible for any large number of students,btohqsg
i will nvr take credit for a student's result 100%  at most 30% of it.,btohqsg
I am helping out my friendâ€™s brother with homework,btohqsg
I believe pedagogy makes lots of diff,btohqsg
yes  but a ton of ppl do it also,btohqsg
But well  I donâ€™t get paid for it,btohqsg
Maybe I can aspire to become a good teacher,btohqsg
oh I thought is some MOE tip rule,btohqsg
worst part is when the whole unit calls you out,btohqsg
but they just accept what u do,btohqsg
unpaid help is not so your ok,btohqsg
Not that John Smith from moetip or anything,btohqsg
I know this really good tuition centre in Marymount,btohqsg
Sir I donâ€™t think you understand what I was trying to do but ok,btohqsg
Also have a lot of As,btohqsg
Hahaha I don't need tuition thx,btohqsg
Donâ€™t worry itâ€™s not up to you whether or not you can enrol,btohqsg
u realise if independent institutions are excluded  the cohort of sg actually didnt do that well for A lvls,btohqsg
Yes  ACSI is causing A Levels scores to inflate,btohqsg
how about we redistribute â€˜wealthâ€™ in schools,btohqsg
by wealth I mean Teachers ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
The top 1% of students get 99% of the teachers,btohqsg
I also heard another popular theory honestly,btohqsg
I heard theyâ€™re proud of getting many people scoring 45,btohqsg
That like people in that tuition centre do well because they already can do well like in terms of self study,btohqsg
and that Teachers have a minimal impact in some cases,btohqsg
Merely knowing does not equip u with skills to tackle questions,btohqsg
guys what are your views on japanese curry,btohqsg
i feel like its sweet sweet and sweet,btohqsg
Skills is also something you can self study from notes though,btohqsg
It helped me get my H3 merit,btohqsg
If u can study skills from notes u wouldn't need practice at all,btohqsg
Btw a question is H3 research worth it,btohqsg
Learn something you arenâ€™t really expert on,btohqsg
Anyone can help me here really would appreciate,btohqsg
and also because their attitude towards studying makes them A material also,btohqsg
"really up to you to decide whether it's ""worth it""",btohqsg
I mean how is the experience generally,btohqsg
I have not gone through the programme there must have been some feedbacks from seniors or smth right,btohqsg
i mean some people actually learn more from their tutors tho,btohqsg
What do u mean  the research institution?,btohqsg
some schools dont encourage it though cause you get marked based on your end product and research isnt guaranteed to succeed,btohqsg
Science specifically computing or material science,btohqsg
+ you wonâ€™t be able to take another H3 unless you appeal or sth :s,btohqsg
Yep I'm intending to cross my fingers,btohqsg
