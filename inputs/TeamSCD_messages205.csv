Hi all I‚Äôm selling van or 10ft lorry. Anybody interested can pm me.Full loan available,btohqsg
Again this person will keep quiet again.,btohqsg
Yeah I ain‚Äôt a honest individual who is trying to make a living to put rice on the table. How pathetic can I be got to go down to the dishonest route to put rice on the table.Didn‚Äôt know that keeping quiet is not honest at all.,btohqsg
dont worry la.. i dont think you need to reveal your commission leh,btohqsg
No one needs to know how much you earn üôèüèª keep fighting the good fight,btohqsg
just some misunderstanding..shouldnt have jump the gun to assumption,btohqsg
Ultimately  willing buyer  willing seller. Period,btohqsg
Exactly! I don‚Äôt force you. As long as you are happy with my price or my service than period.What nonsense is this?!? Keeping quiet means I not honest?,btohqsg
small small issue..all is good la... just small misunderstanding,btohqsg
No need argue already la ü§£,btohqsg

Nah no offence taken. Cheers mate,btohqsg
all good end of story..no harm done to anyone can le,btohqsg
There are many dubious people trying to sell cars  vans here. I just don't want people to get cheated,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt siphon them out by asking their earnings or commissions ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Everyone is trying to earn  a living.  Money not easy to earn   so I don't want you all to buy from dubious places,btohqsg

There is always a better way of approach bro,btohqsg
funny leh... u buy house gt ask developer cost price hw much meh..,btohqsg
maybe can ah i check with hdb,btohqsg
i dunno man.. i wont ask stranger for their bank amount number also ma,btohqsg
You guys obviously have not been cheated by PI,btohqsg
Always do your due diligence before getting anything as well,btohqsg
Basket give him chance man. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Scammers  cheaters. Many out there. You can never filter them out one. One can do is to do due diligence  if felt something is wrong. Start asking people,btohqsg
must ask car developer what is their costing and commission before i buy another car liao,btohqsg
u go ask petrol station hw much the ron98 first,btohqsg
How much it‚Äôs crude oil refined to 98 then don‚Äôt buy cos very expensive,btohqsg
Market is very open & transparent now. You can do all your research before you made a decision who to buy from. If you are afraid of getting cheated you can head to Borneo motor or Kah motor by all means.,btohqsg
add water in.. got more oil alr,btohqsg
i go maken i ask the noodle auntie to breakdown the cost for me before i buy their food,btohqsg
Better ask if not u kanna scam,btohqsg
Remember ask for profit margin first,btohqsg
