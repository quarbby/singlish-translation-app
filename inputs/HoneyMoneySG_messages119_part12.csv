What’s the best card to use for overseas spending in Europe? TIA,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
It seems hsbc EGA eligibility is 2 months now? My sms said till 31 aug.,btohqsg
It feels more like a Structured Product/Deposit now rather than Endowment because CIMB has (deliberately?) not made any mention of insurance element.That aside  whether it is Principal Protected Structured Product/Deposit or Endowment would have rather similar risk/liquidity features.Both are indeed 100% principal protected by the Issuer/Insurer if held till maturity. Both will pay guaranteed (and sometimes non guaranteed interest/benefit).,btohqsg
Isn’t that just mis selling tho,btohqsg
that is why they usually 'invite you to branch' where they then tell you the full info.i guess because there is a stigma of insurance.... people hear.. oh i don't want to buy insurance.. don't even want to go down branch.,btohqsg
It has also not made any mention of any linkages to investment elements (e.g. interest rates  FX rates) that is fairly typical of structured deposits. Still don’t see why the little info provided makes it more likely to be a structured deposit.,btohqsg
maybe the 3 periods of 'deposit placement'30 months24 months12 months,btohqsg
No leh  that’s also a variant of single premium endowments where the premium is split over a few periods,btohqsg
Insurance products aren’t actually bad tho haha,btohqsg
The products usually will only get better over time because the industry is so competitive haha.,btohqsg
yeah but that's when they upfront say.. Manulife... Singlife.. whatever..then people 'insurance light bulb' turns on.when you go DBS or OCBC or CIMB bank... the officer tell you.. eh put money now  6 months later  18 months later  it sounds more like a bank product right?this i guess is what we are trying to say  them camouflaging it as much as possible as a 'safer' bank product instead of the unpopular 'insurance' product where people switch off the moment they hear the trigger word insurance.,btohqsg
actually i think the core product/offering remains the same..it is just how they package or sell or camouflage it,btohqsg
Bancassurance also similar leh. They’ll try to sell single premium endowments as if they are fixed deposits,btohqsg
yeah interesting I THINKinsurance products with cash value (covered by SDIC/PPF).. actually have MORE regulatory protection than NON DEPOSIT bank products like structured products (SDIC won't cover),btohqsg
But common for people to be misled and buy from bank cause they think it’s safer to buy from a bank,btohqsg
Scb c.card application fail  becoz I have trust card? Yesterday they called me ask something related with trust's credit limit😌,btohqsg
Odd. What did you do with ur trust card?,btohqsg
they mentioned the credit limit is share among their banks,btohqsg
Yes the credit limit is shared but it shouldn't cause ur rejection.,btohqsg
But now with July promotion any withdrawal fund doesn't count as fresh funds anymore so if you get any giro outflow it won't earn 1% everyday bouns at all. Then what's the point to giro out at all?,btohqsg
Giro is giro as stated before  the cashback is seperate pool for giro and incremental fund.U can dont have incremental fund in hsbc ega and dont earn the incremental 1 percent for fresh fund. But u still earn 1 percent for whatever bill that is giro out from hdbc ega.,btohqsg
Yes so for me it's no point because it just take away my fresh fund loose the interest I am earning then u rather no giro out,btohqsg
I really dont get u  i not even sure if u are using the term giro in the way it is suppose to be. As long as any bill is giro from hsbc ega u get 1 percent. It does not mean u have to keep the fund for giro in there all the time. Just transfer in on deduction date,btohqsg
Giro is one time setup to pay your recurring bills. Once it's set up  you need to keep money in HSBC ega to pay no? Then just do ega 5 trnx thing to get 1%.,btohqsg
OK let me try to summarise. When u have incremental fund in the hsbc ega account  it will get 1% bouns to the everyday reward programme. But from July promotion  they have added a requirement that only fresh funds has no withdrawal within 30days will qualify.So if you have 100k in the account that earn 4.6% (1% +3.6%). Then when you have any giro out it will not qualify for the 1% interest. You maybe say you can input more money to pay this bill but on top do not withdraw another 30 days to keep it same.,btohqsg
we still do not know how they will enforce the stupid tnc.but you are right if they enforce it 100% as worded. You will lose interest on any funds withdrawn and put back again (even though it might be different money).This should be what Yammy is saying:1st July have $300k fresh funds (earn good interest)5th July  have GIRO out $10k to pay whatever bills.6th July  Yammy moves in $5k money. HSBC MAY enforce the 30 days fresh fund rule and still only pay good interest on $290k (300-10) fresh funds. The $5k is excluded.The above is how the TNC is  if strictly enforced. BUT i don't think they will do it so strict as it doesnt make sense.,btohqsg
I think we are talk about different thing. I am just saying just do 5 transaction so the giro bill keep getting 1 percent while u are so insistent on the fresh fund on saving acct,btohqsg
It should not even be a issue as hsbc ega is use as a rotating account,btohqsg
Yea exactly this makes me ask customer service about it and they only tell me I qualify already with a sms no need 5 transaction out. Very annoying thou,btohqsg
i can tell you.. the HSBC customer service also don't know how HSBC will do it.,btohqsg
i already make 5 fund transfer to non hsbc (fast) but i didnt get any sms. so in order to get 1% we need to get the sms?,btohqsg
I think this new rule of 30 days no withdrawal to qualify as fresh funds then I rather no giro to keep it clean. I just manual pay my bills first.,btohqsg
U have to do sms code to hsbc as per format,btohqsg
To me earning 1% on GIRO transaction >>>> any bonus interest. Let's say 3.55% p.a. bonus interest for 61 days  thats only 0.58%,btohqsg

Maybe she dont have bill as much as us.,btohqsg
OK This is PURELY MY GUESS (i will not take responsibility for my guess  use it with pinch of salt).HSBC is including this 30 days fresh fund treatment clause (which SCB all along has but never enforce) just to scare/discourage people from rotating money to maximise HSBC EGA rewards.HSBC will not have the system capability to differentiate between genuine fresh funds or recycled fresh funds if you move money in from outside HSBC (don't do stupid things like HSBC A to HSBC B  that is like DUH!).So I think we are just scaring ourselves and it will still all be ok. (Repeat: PURELY MY GUESS ONLY).,btohqsg
I mean I'd rather get 1% paying GIRO with HSBC  then 3.5% p.a. fuss free in CIMB  I defo get more $ overall,btohqsg
i already sent the sms on 14 June. received sms on register the jun ega promotion on the same day. but i only top up the ega funds and do the 5 transactions on July 2024. Please advise,btohqsg
This is not a fair comment  and i don't think we should be bashing anybody based on size. It is also a matter of theory.Anyway  if you put $360k fresh funds into HSBC EGA  and you have in/out for genuine investment needs and put back the money as fresh funds into HSBA EGA  the amount at risk is:360 000 x 0.036 / 12 = SGD1 080 of bonus interestThis is more than the max $500 GIRO benefit.,btohqsg
EGA acct needs 5 transactions thou. Unless all 5 are cc spends.,btohqsg
I gave alternative for 3.5% p.a. fuss free  CIMB accts,btohqsg
on the ega 1% interest as i dont get the sms,btohqsg
And I think the saga/arguments we have here.. is EXACTLY WHAT HSBC WANTS...cast doubt and fear in our minds to prevent us from recycling,btohqsg
As long as u do the transaction it is fine  hsbc know to either done send out the message or send it out late,btohqsg
well if you do HSBC EGA correctly  you get 4.6% troublesome interest + max $500 GIRO benefit.,btohqsg
Yea but given all the FUD I'm just presenting an alternative that is sure work one,btohqsg
Hsbc goes by adb for incremental fresh fund. The clause itself wont even make sense. Because let say u put 360k fresh fund on the last day of the promo month  doubt they gonna give u 360k interest in incremental,btohqsg
The sms can be sent as late as last week of the month.,btohqsg
