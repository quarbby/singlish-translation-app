"the guy who said ""STFU"" in the auditorium is gold",btohqsg
a level cert only good for uni...,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why kuro went from a levels to poly,btohqsg
u wanna dox ppl go to sgteens,btohqsg
He gonna have the smarts and skills,btohqsg
but unfortunately... this world is liddat,btohqsg
in most countries around the world vocational schools r very much frowned upon compared to pre u education,btohqsg
I think kurt tay is in here,btohqsg
in other countries prob more elitist  i hv a friend from germany and he said that hes automatically looked down on just because he didnt go to a pre u edu  even though he said he prefers hands on learning,btohqsg
And if i screw alvl is honggan for me alr,btohqsg
at least in sg  poly n ite students can still get a shot at uni. in other countries the moment u enter vocational schs ur chances of entering uni is close to 0 no matter how hard u work,btohqsg
Is it wrong to say that poly is basically just a better version of ite,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know much about this,btohqsg
Yeah  ofc for poly. Thatâ€™s why some ppl go to poly after completing higher Nitec  after they get their poly diploma can go to local U,btohqsg
But ite degree can enter uni directly?,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t heard of that happening,btohqsg
Oh ok then if want local u no choice but to go poly,btohqsg
from a straits times article i read  50% of students enrol in poly  30% ish to jc. in other countries its prob 90% to pre u education and 10% to vocational schs,btohqsg
Even NUS interview courses such as law and medicine accept ppl from poly,btohqsg
like after reading abt other countries edu system i realised that sgs is actually a lot better,btohqsg
bro was scolding me like 10 seconds ago,btohqsg
in other countries its way more elitist  voc schs r never even talked abt. but at least over here poly n ite students r recognised  although shunned,btohqsg
actl regarding education system i have smth to say,btohqsg
Ok I guess I got to Google it,btohqsg
memelinewhy this chat group has no doxxing rule istg,btohqsg
it's telegram so i think i can say   unlike discord. if i say this on discord confirm gonna get downvoted and flamed,btohqsg
this fucker got nothing better to do,btohqsg
Oh wait i read this wrongly,btohqsg
holy shit!! then YT ban liao,btohqsg
or how in sweden for ex  my swedish friend who never went to uni but only has a dip is earning literally nothing. diploma in europe is a fucking joke,btohqsg
this chat would have turned into a dating site featuring matcha and 2k other ppl,btohqsg
at least over here... poly grads can still earn and have a living...,btohqsg
u can only get downvoted on reddit,btohqsg
y u all have so much time to use discord and tele,btohqsg
pankeks is the biggest bully. shes horrible and i hate the way she treats people and just laughs at peoples problems,btohqsg
