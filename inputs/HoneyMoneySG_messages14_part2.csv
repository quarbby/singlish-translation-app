Like that have to use grab card liao,btohqsg
Does anyone know LatitudePay have to link to what credit card to use BNPL at Harvey Norman?,btohqsg
the 150 dollars is for dbs new cardholders? which participanting stall in capitamall is advisable?,btohqsg
shanelook for the card promotion banner under ongoing campaigns for more details. Itâ€™s for anyone who holds any DBS/POSB Credit and Debit cards thatâ€™s linked to ShopBack. Remember to enrol into the CapitaStar/ShopBack campaign. Just use ShopBack pay and you can stack the 2 campaigns.It has to be 10 different stores/shops/restaurants for the DBS $150,btohqsg
Hmm  personally I spend it mostly on food and snacks like famous Amos  eureka popcorns  bears  12 cupcakes  etc and meals in restaurants that I can get just nice $20 or slightly more. In that way  I can maximise the cashback ðŸ˜‚ so itâ€™s really up to you to plan and decide what do you like and get the max out of it ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
I have been using UOB one until now  but after seeing your citi miles reward strategy I am wondering if citi is the card to go with.  Also  will I get 4 MPD for the education bills?,btohqsg
Citi PremierMiles : telco bills will not earn miles right?,btohqsg
ok i see...thanks for the info. can i know the 10 different stores need to be those who accept shopback pay?,btohqsg
the 10 purchases need not to be fulfilled all in 1 days right?,btohqsg
Yes  you just have search in ShopBack app for the nearby shops in the area or malls that youâ€™re going to.,btohqsg
No  for the DBS campaign  you gave up to 31st Oct,btohqsg
I meant citi miles reward + amaze stratergy,btohqsg
At the 5th transaction  you will get $10 scratch card.At the 8th transaction  you will get $35 scratch card.At the 10th transaction  you will get $100 scratch card.So in total $150Remember to check your rewards tab for the scratch card and scratch it immediately. Otherwise  it goes away in 48 hours,btohqsg
If direct no. But if via payall yes,btohqsg
I see! The service fee for PayAll is 2% correct? 2% for each payment?,btohqsg
the 10 different stores / shops part... if i go different malls but same brand shop example Uniqlo.. will it be eligible or must all 10 shop brands be different,btohqsg
Just did f&b grab QR hmm  zero. Point,btohqsg
Has anyone here gotten anything good from Grab after the nerf lol?,btohqsg
Grab rrsdslly Nerf until cmi.But gtabb taxi's still got point,btohqsg
why direct no? telco not excluded right?,btohqsg
From amaze + citi rewards miles?,btohqsg
yes  mcc excluded even via Amaze. Amaze dun change the MCC.,btohqsg
Got it.Just a follow upOn an average I spend about 2-2.5 kOn mostly local spend.Is citi + amaze  better than uob one for me?,btohqsg
citi+amaze cap at $1000. depends what u spend on e.g. got bonus rebate from uob one? excluded mcc?,btohqsg
Nearly no exclusion on uob one,btohqsg
Is it? I pay my Gomo with citi premier miles card and i got no points,btohqsg
hm uob one quite a lot of exclusions  just a bit lax for some,btohqsg
Is it.... let me double check  which are the common ones?,btohqsg
long list. Not excluded utilities... think that's about it for more lax mcc.,btohqsg
Anyone tried m1 bill payment with Evol card through their app?,btohqsg
Must be different brand too according to the campaign conditions,btohqsg
Oh then will be slightly tougher,btohqsg
Yes  so it requires a bit of planning and calculations ðŸ˜‚ I did it once in September so this month itâ€™s easier. If the campaign is still running next month in November then the 10 unique brands requirement will reset.,btohqsg
if can same brand but must be different malls still not that bad lolif all must be totally unique 10 different brands irregardless malls then not so simple.. only left 2 weeks,btohqsg
but if stack with capita  total $200 spend can be essentially free liao considering capita side gives a total of $50+/- overall also at least hopefully lol,btohqsg
Zero for me paid $6.2 hahahaha,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s true also but still doable. Just that this month if want to stack with CapitaLand campaign then have to consider all within CapitaMallLast month I did it with Orchard Road campaign stack with DBS $150 and Capita Malls so mostly inPlaza Singapura12 cupcakesFufu PotAkimitsuBearsFamous Amosllao llaoThis month pretty much the same but I included belowJurong East WestGateMun ZukHaagen DazsGo with friends and family  can easily hit plus can spend time with good returns,btohqsg
Does dbs wwmc give 4mpd for m1 broadband payment?,btohqsg
only manual adhoc payments not recurring,btohqsg
Hi guys  I am using Citi Cashback+  want to check how can I pay for qr code payment at food stalls to be eligible for the 1.6% cashback ?2) if I sign dbs fresh live card  is there anyway to earn cashback for qr code payment ? As they only have contactless/mobile at 5% cb and 0.3% for other category,btohqsg
Usually I just top up to grab wallet and use grabpay   but since grabpay now nerfed  looking for an alternative,btohqsg
Other bank app need u have a bank acc with $$ inside,btohqsg
Example SCB got SGQr but need a bank account,btohqsg
Which app do u use for amex ?,btohqsg
Dotj see Citi on SGQr often,btohqsg
Amex pay inside amex app got a function,btohqsg
Not often I see Citi logo on SGQR,btohqsg
But does this means need Citibank acc or just their credit card will do?,btohqsg
U can try see if your Citi app got a way to scan QR,btohqsg
Got   but not sure if it will use my Citi Cashback+ card,btohqsg
