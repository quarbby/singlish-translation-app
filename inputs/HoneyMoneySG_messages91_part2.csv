I assume u are buying BTO and not alrdy bought.1. Take hdb loan for now. Can always go to bank loan if interest rates goes below 2.6%. Note that once u go bank loan  u cant go back to hdb loan.2. Depends on your financial goals  how much cash u have and age. If below 40  why keep so much cpf is OA and dont use. If possible use ur OA but leave 20k in there.3. Again  this is personal choice  no right or wrong  depends on your financial planning/goal and how much u earn and how much cash u have. If u have a long run way  i personally feel 15 to 25yrs is a good tenure. If u take hdb loan u can pay off early down the road,btohqsg

Anyone has 2 same grab rides charged twice and a different price ? The amt charged to my grab apps is 14.80 and not 28.70. Uob said the actual amt is 14.80 and 28.70 is the estimated amount and this will be reversed out from the their system?,btohqsg
1. At the current interest climate go HDB first and wait out. The benefit is also non-monetary. With hdb  loan is not disbursed until u collect keys. Bank loans are disbursed immediately so payments start.2. Think leave 20k if u are able to.3. Max out.. to lower the monthly instalment. That‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt plan to stay in that hdb forever and will sell.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs normal if you take metered taxi. The actual value will be posted and the initial estimate will disappear after some time. So no reason to worry,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know that using grab apps has metered rides,btohqsg
Just thought is odd.. cos I always choose fixed charge,btohqsg
No point to panic since it‚Äôs still pending (not posted),btohqsg
:) not panic. Am just very curious how this works. Thanks.,btohqsg

Sorry  I‚Äôm new to this‚Ä¶ just to check and clarify for point 3:Max out the loan tenure  won‚Äôt the interest that needs to be paid be more as compared to say 10 years loan or 20 years loan?,btohqsg
Ya  but if u going to sell say after MOP then max out can save cash,btohqsg
Kind of like using the bank‚Äôs money to make money from capital appreciation?,btohqsg
3. leverage is how people use property to get rich faster. you use less capital outlay to earn outsized returns based on ppty valuation.anw loan interest rates are higher than OA's 2.5% interest income rate. but there were 2 decades before covid where bank loan rates were consistently lower than OA's 2.5% earn rate  allowing people who used bank loan to arbitrage and make CPF earn that extra interest income (vs if one were to use OA to paydown in advance and then have accrue interest at 2.5% on said sum),btohqsg
bank loan also disbursed when collect key,btohqsg

UOB Christmas Earmark has been released for those in the first batch!However you will NOT be able to participate in the current Rising Dragon.Do be prepared for the next UOB promo  likely starts in April 2024.,btohqsg
Not exactly lah lol.if got extra money to rotate between stash and uob one haha,btohqsg
Stash has lower interest. Is it still worth to participate?,btohqsg
Has anyone's UOB cny funds has been earmarked? Or not yet,btohqsg
3 plus ard 1.7 if earmark  not a bad choice for total ard 4.7. Just dont touch for the whole period and do one time full withdraw and let it rest for one month to reset to zero. 3 is based on 100k mab and no withdrawal,btohqsg
Earmarked 2 days ago  registered in Jan,btohqsg
Calculated. In this interest dropping environment. It‚Äôs still worth it. Due to the extra $558 and short lock in period.,btohqsg

i am of the opinion stash + promo is not worth it.I rather only do UOB One + promo (which means can only participate twice a year)  but you rotate 2 humans.Quarter 1 = Human A with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 2 = Human B with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 3 = Human A with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 4 = Human B with UOB One + earmarkof course when a Human has no earmark  that human is still earning 5% p.a. on UOB One. Just no earmark extra cash reward.,btohqsg
yes rising dragon (first batch) all earmarked already.. many shouted here.,btohqsg
Only work if u got 2 human mah  cant expect everyone can control 2 human bank acct plus fulfill criteria,btohqsg
yeah also true... just sharing if can control multiple humans  what is the optimal (in my opinion) strategy loh..if only one human  i guess stash also ok  but i don't like the mechanics of stash (must increase ADB) style.. easy to mess up.,btohqsg
Depend on amt too  like if got 200k can do your way. Got 400k  or more different strategy. Too many financial intitution wanting fresh fund liao due to high interest environment so throw out alot of different promo,btohqsg

All these abt UOB dragon promotion  suppose if emptied out 100K on Dec 30  does it affect the Dec ONE bonus interest payout in Jan ?,btohqsg
SCB E saver credits interest on monthly basis? Eg early of the mth for previous mth?,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt  if you manage to plan it so that your average balance for Dec is still above 100k,btohqsg
How to compute average balance? I maintain minimum 100k throughout,btohqsg
hello  can check if citi premier miles can still be used for payment of hospital bills?,btohqsg
Yes. Your ADB will drop so the interest will be affected. You can compensate by putting extra from 1 -29 dec.,btohqsg
thanks! looks like not able to already,btohqsg
If gov hospital healthhub is not excluded,btohqsg
