"So did you read the definition of fresh fund? ""‚ÄúFresh Funds‚Äù means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account. Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier‚Äôs order(s) or demand draft(s) are not permitted. """,btohqsg
Sry I think I misunderstood year mark.If I have 150k inside UOB now and did not participate in the UOB nation savers can I register to participate?,btohqsg
Hi guys  is today the last day to move my funds out of HSBC EGA in preparation for the Oct/Nov promo?,btohqsg
üòµ‚Äçüí´ hi all  is there any card for 8062? For my wife delivery üòÇ,btohqsg
which hospital? most cards cant earn rewards leh,btohqsg
Search up down. Seems mostlyOut except utima,btohqsg
Mount A or E‚Ä¶ ya lo. I search whole night lol. Cannot find any,btohqsg
Does anyone know what time is HSBC EGA account balance snapshot?,btohqsg
yes today before 11am would have been good  but i guess now should still be ok,btohqsg
haha i was just doing up my excel and i realised 31st october thursday is a public holiday...troublesome again  whenever month end is a holiday or saturday/sunday,btohqsg
If that is the case  have to do the transfer 1 day before?,btohqsg
yeah i always like to have some buffer and finish all the necessary ideally 1 day in advance.sometimes website maintenance or transaction needs manual officer verification.,btohqsg
I see. The promo states that fresh funds must not be withdrawn and re-deposited within the last 30 days. Does it start counting today? Is it better to play safe and re-deposit on 2 October?,btohqsg
so far didn't seem to implement,btohqsg
but be smart and don't go and do exact amount.if you moved out $100 000 on 31st August  don't go and move back in $100 000 on 20th September for example.Move in $90 000 or $101 000 for example,btohqsg
and ideally from a different bank used on the 31st August.,btohqsg
If UOB were to have the same pattern then means we shld empty our bank balance in Sep right. maybe they launch a new Q4 promo using Sep MAB.....,btohqsg
yes that is the idea if you want to ANTICIPATE (with no guarantees) a Q4 UOB Savings Promo which would likely refer to September 2024's ADB (you need to keep as low as possible),btohqsg
Just curious  if u trf out fund today  you miss one day bonus interest? Why not on 1st Sep?,btohqsg
transfer in 1st Sep (Sunday) will be dated 2nd Sep,btohqsg
Is it just the Posting date or Effective date?,btohqsg
e.g. when a cheque is returned  the posting date of the reversal transaction is current date but the effective date is back-date to the original cheque deposit date.,btohqsg
and this will affect the HSBC EGA's ADB in September (needs to be as low as possible) for October's use.,btohqsg
your idea is there.In fact different Banks have different mechanics for recognising funds on non business days.However  I would encourage you NOT to play with such things to avoid love letters from banks.Suggest just do cleanly on actual working days during working hours.As long as you move out from a 4.x% account into a 3.x% holding account (like Esaver)  it is much safer and better on your mental health.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know which card is good to use to make the payment in agoda and overseas spending  ? I have UOB lady‚Äôs card but it is too late for me to change the category now.,btohqsg
Agoda is dbs wwmc. Overseas spend is citi rewards + amaze.,btohqsg
Anyone know Challenger use what card best now.In case you all don't know. Challenger has issues being recognised as Apple Pay due to their terminal issue. So no UOB PPV for 4mpd.I am not sure if I should Paywave UOB VS  later also mess up.,btohqsg
thanks... i will use Kris+ and UOB KF (total 1+3) for 4mpd,btohqsg
U could do kris+ amaze crmc total 4+1mpd,btohqsg
ya so transfer out by today,btohqsg
Oh wow it's been some time since they did 0% processing fee  even for the 3 months one. As usual  charge to card then apply.,btohqsg
Conversely  to restart OCBC360  should transfer into the account today or tomorrow?,btohqsg
How much are you transferring? 100k?,btohqsg
Should be fine. Assuming ur 360 is empty  ur Aug MAB will be 3096 and ur sep will be 96k. No issues.,btohqsg
Hey there ‚Ä¶ new to this group ‚Ä¶ I want advice for best credit for lounge access ‚Ä¶. I already have Citibank card which has unlimited lounge access for myself and 1 guest ‚Ä¶ but we are family of 4 ‚Ä¶ so need another one using which we 4 can access lounge atleast 4-6 times a year,btohqsg
That‚Äôs has 2 visits right ?,btohqsg
10 visits. Use prestige for u and ur wife and maybe 3 visits from vantage for u and 2 kids.,btohqsg
So vantage has primary and guest also ?,btohqsg
Also I wanted to check which credit cards still pay me for paying insurance premiums ?,btohqsg
No. Just 10 visits. Other than that  I can only think HSBC Visa infinite card. You can get supp cards for ur kids and they will get their own unlimited lounge access.,btohqsg
Kids are 10 and 14 and hence they r not given supplementary cards,btohqsg
so you recommend DBS vantage which has 10 visits ‚Ä¶ how much is the annual fee or is it possible to waive it off ?,btohqsg
599.5$ a year. 60k spend to waive.https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/dbs-vantage-visa-infinite-card,btohqsg
Cool ‚Ä¶ thanks for the details .. appreciate it,btohqsg
Also any idea which credit card still gives points or miles for insurance premiums ?,btohqsg
Most cars like Hsbc Citi have stopped giving miles or points when we pay insurance through them,btohqsg
AMEX Plat Charge. Main cardholder and spouse as a supp card holder. Each of you will be entitled unlimited visit + 1 guest.,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs like 1799 annual fee right ? That‚Äôs too high ..,btohqsg
I know plat comes with other advantages like golf etc but I don‚Äôt use any .. and my main purpose is lounge .. hence looking forward for the best option for that,btohqsg
How did you derive at 3096?If AUG ADB is 6427  (basically listed down daily bal/31) it is also OK to just trf 96k?is there an impact if I transferred the monies in today or tmr? trying to grapple with the Sat/Sun value date recognition by the banks.,btohqsg
Hello guys  new to this group.Would like some advice on my first credit card.I‚Äôm working overseas  so I don‚Äôt spend locally  I‚Äôm more towards accumulating miles.I‚Äôm considering DBS Altitude VS UOB Privy  does anyone knows  like for hotel and travel booking which is better? Seems like DBS Alt only can choose from like one website right?I do understand PRIVY have more miles but I feel the terms and conditions is more.Thank you guys!,btohqsg
As stated by Anthony  that's the assumption that your OCBC 360 is empty. More accurately is to check the exact OCBC 360 ADB (do not self calculate)  add 3096.Suggest you transfer asap as once passed today's cut-off timing  it'll be taken as Monday's (2 Sep) transfer.,btohqsg
What about uob lady/lady solitaire travel or dbs woman world master card for online booking of flights/hotels?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi everyone  quick question about the DBS Altitude 5mpd promo:Do I need to spend $1000 in both September and October to qualify for the 5mpd rate? I'm planning to book a hotel through Agoda in September  but I don't think I'll be able to hit the $1k mark in October.,btohqsg
Hi can check for moomoo new user promo the deposit of cumulative amount 3000  10000 and 100000 is it just need to deposit 100000 will get all the reward or need to deposit 113000?,btohqsg
If I pay UOB credit card bills using UOB Krisflyer debit card  can I earn the miles?,btohqsg
Thank you  can check what is the easiest way to clock the cumulative buy trade?,btohqsg
I saw the reward 2 is to complete 3 while reward 3 is to complete 8,btohqsg
hi hsbc got promo for next mth? do we need to register already ? I realise August is only for one mth (instead of 2),btohqsg
it has been 2 months recently,btohqsg
Questions on UOB Visa Signature1) For spends below the $5 block like $3 etc does it also contribute towards the min 1k spending?2) Does it make sense to clock transactions below $5 block since the 9X bonus UNI$ is a combination of all transaction before rounding the nearest $5?,btohqsg
"Hello all  now that UOB has ""banned"" amaze from earning miles from 1st Oct.My original plan was to use amaze with UOB KF but now that transaction with amaze tagged no longer earn miles.What is the next best cards for overseas shopping with no cap?",btohqsg
Always been 1 month. Just that you register for 2 months. They might only release Sep promo on Monday.,btohqsg
Based on the last nation of savers promo by UOB  do i need to move out my funds by today to prepare for the next possible promo on 1 Oct?Understand that it is based on the average daily balance of the previous month which is Sept.,btohqsg
it COULD be Trust Cashback... we are still observing and assessing this card.,btohqsg
ORAny UOB PRVI card at 2.4mpd2.4 miles x 1.5 cents - 4% FX = 0.4% net cost  but it could be positive if your miles valuation is above 1.5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Oh Maybank horizon card. 2.8mpd for fcy spend. UOB still has advantage cuz UOB uni$ pool.,btohqsg
this one i have bad experience so i won't use it unless no choicethey exclude SNACK by Income without any notification,btohqsg
i would stick to Amex PRVI because have free limo and potentially Loyalty Miles if exceed $50k,btohqsg
Should be per month. Each month has their own 1k spend requirement and 2k cap.,btohqsg
Maybank if 2.8mpd = 2.8 x 1.5 - 4 = Positive 0.2% benefit.Potentially same as Trust Cashback card if your miles valuation is 1.5 cents.,btohqsg
UOB Visa signature will award 0.4mpd when posted then add all your spends at the end of statement month  round down to 5 and award 3.6mpd. So not too bad with trnx under 5$.,btohqsg
My issue is that for shopping with UOB KF  it has to be online. Now that UOB no longer reward miles with amaze. I am lost.Planning to do lots of shopping on my trip in Dec,btohqsg
I have no issues with dinning and others with UOB KF  I can just use direct. but shopping is the problem.,btohqsg
Like how much. Under 2k above 1k can use UOB visa signature. Else consider UOB Prvi or Maybank horizon VS as above.,btohqsg
so can kinda consider the below $5 to be at 3.6mpd instead correct?,btohqsg
actually Amaze + UOB KF wasn't the commonly used shopping card UNLESS you aiming those high value luxury goods like Bags or Watches because those would most likely fall within the white listed MCC.For smaller value items  UOB VS with $2k cap should be sufficient and you get your miles faster.,btohqsg
Or any rounding. Like you spend 38 dollars. 35$ get 0.4mpd and 38 dollars get 3.6mpd. the diff is very minimal so I just tap. üòÖ,btohqsg
Trust cashback suddenly becomes good üòä.,btohqsg
Yea  was looking to purchase a bag for my wife  And a watch for my self,btohqsg
yes if tens of thousands:UOB PRVIsMaybank Horizon VSTrust Cashbackthese are the ones I can think of for now.,btohqsg
I have checked out those cards  but I think I will go with HSBC T1 as is it able to pool points and free transfer till end of year.2.4 mpd for foreign spending,btohqsg
From other dps so far  it's gonna be good for a year üòÉ. Better rounding logic too.,btohqsg
"I am highly disappointed with Maybank for now... so even if higher at 2.8mpd i tend to avoid.... even though i have Rewards Infinite with no expiry.being scammed due to invoking of the ""bank has the right to exclude transactions without notice"" leaves a very bad taste",btohqsg
Many HSBC t1 holders cannot waive their AF 2nd year onwards,btohqsg
i think if he whack tens of thousand ... can la,btohqsg
I think 20k can confirm waive for hsbc t1.,btohqsg
I think already over 20K.I didn't know that HSBC T1 doesn't earn miles using services like Ipaymy and cardup. So I paid my ID through Ipaymy. I panicked after that and tried to cancel the payment but could not.But for some reasons I did receive miles according to the amount I spent on Ipaymy.So win-win I guess,btohqsg
Is it correct to say that even if we cannot hit the 3-month consecutive spend  TrustCashback still wins TrustCC hands-down for overseas spend  because at least there is 1% rebate?,btohqsg
Oh   not compulsory to hit 2 months 1k? Then its fine for me,btohqsg
Ya it said so in tnc. Promo period is 1-30 sep so oct is another promo period. 1k only needs to be in sep.,btohqsg
Is Mari Invest limited by the $100k limit of the Mari Bank Account?Where is the interest from the Investment credited daily?Can I have $90k in Mari Invest and $20k in the savings account? How would that work?,btohqsg
Just curious for Singapore saving bonds  when I participate is 3%. Will the 3% be fixed or it will move according to mkt rates?,btohqsg
"I recalled i read up on this 4yrs ago. What i recalled from the tnc was that the ""essential occupier"" cannot buy any other private property. Supposed to declare to hdb and sign on it. Now sure whats the process now. So to me its like ""do but dont get caught"" kind of scenario",btohqsg
For each SSB  there is a table which shows the yearly rate for 10 years.,btohqsg
Now essential occupier is free to buy private after the MOP.,btohqsg
Fixed based on the table provided when u applied.Basically locked in (government promises to pay those rates for 10 years).,btohqsg
All along is like this.Only during mop period  essential occupier cannot buy another property.,btohqsg
Was referring toWSwho said cannot 4yrs ago. I also think all along is can. Just a matter of will kenna ABSD or not...,btohqsg

Hi! Can I confirm that hsbc rev  Dbs women world and uob lady‚Äôs card bonus points is capped by calendar month and not statement date?,btohqsg
I thought it was capped at statement month and realised the cap is by calendar month :x,btohqsg
If I had just opened my HSBC EGA today and just sent a sms to register for Aug promo  I can fund my account on 2 sep and still get 3.6% + 1% for Sep right?,btohqsg
And I should deposit $2k + 5 x FAST transactions out on 2 Sep morning before transferring the remaining funds on the same day  right? HSBC EGA is a bit confusing for me  so just want to make sure.,btohqsg

Im currently in a dilemma between applying for citi premiermiles or citi rewards. Im new to citibank.Is it worth to pay for annual fees for premiermiles just to receive the higher sign up benefit(miles)?,btohqsg
Hi all  what is the next best card beside amaze+citi rewards for use in japan?,btohqsg
Hi... Can I use Citi rewards or solitaire (transport and family) cards pairing with amaze to pump petrol and buy grocery in JB and still enjoy at least 4 miles/$?,btohqsg
For now yes.Starting 1 Oct UOB no longer rewards miles transaction paired with amaze.,btohqsg
Just registered the hsbc EGA bonus interest promo .. so I deposit up to 200k now or wait till Monday then deposit ?,btohqsg
Register and deposit after 9am on 2 sep monday,btohqsg
Depends on your value of miles  whether it ranks higher than value of gifts,btohqsg
Thanks for the updates! What cc would u suggest to use for travel related expenses from 1 Oct onwards  able to pair with amaze..,btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to amaze and I‚Äôm pairing with Uob krisflyer. Just want to check  if I spend on local dining  I will give my amaze card and not Uob krisflyer right? And I saw some video saying there‚Äôs a cap or something for local spend. Plus the 3 mpd uncapped and it says online travel  so if I book travel by Expedia  I will need to check out by amaze instead of krisflyer right?,btohqsg
what u mean by travel related? online/offline? local/overseas?,btohqsg
You don't have to use amaze for local dinning with UOB Krisflyer.Only shopping with UOB Krisflyer needs to be online.There is no cap for UOB Krisflyer.,btohqsg
I see. So I only use amaze for overseas dining. How about booking from Expedia  I use Uob krisflyer or amaze since it says needs to be ‚Äúonline‚Äù travel,btohqsg
1. uob excluding Amaze wef 1 Oct2. use uob krisflyer directly for dining and expedia,btohqsg
I just gotten my amaze and waiting for my Uob krisflyer. Seems this is bad news. Looks like amaze got no more use?,btohqsg
After 1 Oct  amaze is only useful for CRMC.That's my opinion.,btohqsg
Oh I see thank you for your help,btohqsg
Everything.. online  offline and overseas... Ya... Like quite limited,btohqsg
U register now. Your reference month is July 2024.,btohqsg
Thx all these while my balance inside ega is around 2k only so no diff‚Ä¶ I just wanna earn one mth interest from ega before putting it back to uob one in Oct hopefully with uob promo,btohqsg

Hello! Is there any credit card that can provide cashback/rewards/miles for buying SimplyGo adult concession. Because most credit cards exclude wallet top up including SimplyGo,btohqsg
the max interest for sep should be 4.4%  instead of 3.4% stated on the site right ü§î 3.35 + 0.05 + 1%,btohqsg
1% is a totally separate mechanic from this 3.x%,btohqsg
previous months always include the 1% though,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt matter whether they word it as 3.4 or 4.4.What‚Äôs in the individual component tnc is what matters,btohqsg
eg. august 4.70% = 3.65 + 0.05 + the other 1%,btohqsg
ya hopefully it‚Äôs just a typo,btohqsg
"Sorry.. i am bit confused on this term""For example  if the customer has already registered for the August Everyday GlobalAccount Bonus Interest Promotion then he/she will not be eligible to register for this Promotion."" Am worried becos my human2 has sent the sms for Aug promo..So far.. I have sent sms for both human every month. And alternate the fund (via 3rd party bank) and do the 5+1 transactions. Will my fund still eligible for the 3.3+1 this month?",btohqsg
If u sent SMS every month for human A. Human A will only qualify for the 2 months in that first registration.When u are in a cycle  any registration for a new cycle will be invalid.,btohqsg
So far i have been doing exact same steps on both humans  the difference is1. humanA acct is opened in May  humanB opened in June2. Funds is zero on one and max on other alternate months.What is implication?,btohqsg
Should be ok. Since when human A register again in June it‚Äôs invalid.,btohqsg
So.. to be correct  actually the sms for each human just need to be sent in alternate months. No need to send every month. Right?,btohqsg
I see.. phew.. thank you so much!!@mttelegrammt,btohqsg
This is the game play as HSBC EGA tnc is for 2 months now.It used to be for 3 months and it was a different play style then.,btohqsg
I feel so disappointed in myself  been 3months  yet i am still confused üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Seems u get it already. Have confidence!,btohqsg
Btw.. the 1% cashbacks only starts after the 2k in and 5x out transactions is done  or it doesnt matter? If it does  then shdnt we do it immediately now,btohqsg
As long as done same month it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
U will notice once done it lasts 2 months.,btohqsg
I notice cashback on giro payment comes in like 2-3 days after it posted.But lets say my humanB starts the new cycle this month  and has not done any transfer nor sms  and a giro payment kicks in  wont it not earn the cashback?Or will they realise after u send in the sms  and then look back to find what they havent cashbacked u. üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
If just started. Do as early as possible.Once engine starts running it‚Äôs fine to do anytime within the month because the first round will last 2 months and each subsequent round also lasts 2 months.,btohqsg
Ya true.. i tink just do it now. (I was wondering to do it before sms or after sms? But dang it! I will do both! üòÖ ),btohqsg
You are right. Just realise the event only count on 9am monday onwards  i will do sms and transfer that time..Haha thank you! (*goes hiding in shameüò≠*),btohqsg

Presumably if you have participated in a Lazada promo or compaign  u would be put through UOB cards application workflow which trigger Singpass MyInfo or data entry.I suggest u consider changing your UOB ibanking credential and Singpass Mobile app PIN if you have not done so recently.

Leaving me with only $13+ in total interest.Furthermore   I find the amount of interest very little considering I actually topped up beyond $20k.Don't understand how it's being calculated.Anyone else has tried Chocolate Finance?,btohqsg
Does anyone know for dbs altitude in hotel category  ACCOR included? Cuz they gave examples as i screenshot but they don't give much option of hotel groups,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to check the 1.6% cashback issued by ocbc infinity cc?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any ways to check whether you have been qualified in the EGA Aug bonus interest promo? Do HSBC sent you any confirmation msg?,btohqsg
Why top-up above 20k tho? There's a fee if they outperform the targeted return (currently 3.5% p.a.).,btohqsg
Best example of mcc change by ShopBack:Golden villageHSBC live+ = 7832ShopBack HSBC live+ = 5814,btohqsg
Only if the hotel mcc falls within the eligible mcc. Eg. Some hotels in Dubai are using 6513 which is excluded by Lady.,btohqsg
Hi All  need some advise ..I'm going to pay $15k deposit for a car...which card is good to use for miles?,btohqsg
There's 2 options for you to choose... Co-ownership or sole ownership with essential occupier. There's absolutely no need for any justification required. Lol,btohqsg
for choc finance make sure you don't put more than 20k,btohqsg
else you can get negative returns on the additional amount that exceed 20k,btohqsg
so for sept  with additional 1% will be 4.3% if below $2 000 000?,btohqsg
Hi all  if im applying for UOB One card  how do I know whether im within the first 200 new to UOB credit card customers? Is it only after applying?Checking this as im signing up only due to the 350$ cash credit.,btohqsg
Does the first 200 have a min spending as well?,btohqsg
for mine in Dec 23 previously the promotion was 1st 200 to spend $1k in 2 consecutive months.Checked with uob staff that they will count for both months  from first day of card approval date  how long you take to spend $1k in both months  then sum the days of both months together and rank accordinglyEg.my card approval date is 2nd Dec23- I hit $1k spending in 5th Dec23  that‚Äôs 3 days- come jan24  I hit $1k spending in 4th jan24  which is 2 daysSo total I took 5 days then they will rank accordinglyHope that helps  alternatively you can confirm with UOB live chat/ staffs as well,btohqsg
You know if you get the reward or not. Or like what Jeremy said  check with CSO  but no guarantees they will actually know.,btohqsg
I read ML article that cashback trust is not good  so how that will work? Some more  we still can‚Äôt pay Trust with dbs cc pay bill,btohqsg
Read that article too. In my opinion  it was ‚Äúnot good‚Äù for optics. The cashback was not 15% as advertised in headline but closer to 4.1% at max capped at $2k monthly spending  with the cashback credited quarterly.,btohqsg
Up to individual to gauge if 4+% cashback is good or not,btohqsg
Correct to say it is the only cash back card with no foreign currency fees even if don‚Äôt meet quarterly spending?,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Can I confirm all uob card points can consolidate altogether and redeem in 1 transaction? Like uob preferred  lady‚Äôs card and Prvi  all the point will consolidate in a pool,btohqsg

Hihi  if i add citi rewards to google pay and make payment  is it consider online payment? Thanks.,btohqsg

Hi i just finished utilising maybank‚Äôs isavvy high yield promo and scb‚Äôs yet to start. Why else can I place my excess cash?,btohqsg
this is exclusion from Instarem points (very hard to clock points to get $20  so can consider as neglible). Not excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi all  my friend wants to start collecting miles but doesn't want the hassle of tracking his expenditure. He is a UOB user and has the UOB one credit card  should I suggest him to swap to UOB preferred platinum as he mostly uses Applepay.In that case  does the UOB one card need to spend a minimum every month for him to keep the card?,btohqsg
If stick to Apple Pay only. Uob ppv is one of the easiest to earn 4mpdNo minimumMax $1110$5 blocks,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if buying the $128 adult concession will be considered a simplygo transaction & earn SCB smart card bonus points?,btohqsg
Apple Pay in-apps or Apple Pay paywave? Majority of transactions more than $5?,btohqsg
Sorry this is a silly question but do you ask the receptionist whats the mcc?,btohqsg
You need the Instarem app and the Instarem Amaze card. Set the payment source to Amaze Wallet with $0 inside  then pay with Amaze card. The transaction will fail  and you can check the MCC of the transaction in the Instarem Amaze app.,btohqsg
Hi all  my primary card is crmc+amazethinking of applying for a 2nd one incase it exceeds 1000 cap  should i go for uob lady‚Äôs or dbs womans world,btohqsg
Thanks for the information. I am going to US  hope it is included.,btohqsg
Are your spendings more online or offline? What do you usually spend on? Food/groceries/shopping etc.,btohqsg
food  grab  sometimes online shoppingand travelling like agoda/tickets but not often,btohqsg
If you can get UOB lady solitaire  I'd get that with dining and travel categories. If not  get dbs wwmc then put all online transactions on it and offline on crmc.,btohqsg
woman‚Äôs world points expire after 1 year. unless ur excess spending can hit $2500 spend within a year  lady‚Äôs/solitaire would be better,btohqsg
uob points also expires in 2 years am i right?,btohqsg
Yes. UOB has this AF mechanismhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/228701And uni$ pool so you can consider other UOB cards in the future.,btohqsg
Why need to hit $2500 within a year?,btohqsg
min 5000 dbs points for 10k miles,btohqsg
If expires and I convert to kfmiles  what is the validity afterwards?,btohqsg
so technically if i havent hit a decent amt of miles  i can transfer over to kf to accumulate it for 3 years before it expires right?,btohqsg
Anyone know if trust cashback card shopping category works for supermarkets?,btohqsg
sort of but should plan how to use the miles before it expires,btohqsg
This suckBut I might still keep it because they got free airport lounge and I do not have a general spending card,btohqsg
"That card used to be my ""go to"" I think I am switching to maybank family and friend card.",btohqsg
Before anything  check your MAB for Jun first. Once you check and confirm you're eligible  then register and deposit in Sep. To be safe  latest by 27 Sep. Just remember how OCBC digital services went down today ü§™Answering:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/229744,btohqsg
This additional clause on fresh funds definition is going to cause some headache. It's not clear what withdrawels mean. Worst case it can include giro deductions.,btohqsg

Is there any category to choose from for UOB lady's if I want to buy phone from Oppo/Singtel shop?,btohqsg
if can buy vouchers e.g. Amazon  lazada from heymax can choose the fashion category.,btohqsg
Register first and once receive acknowledgment  deposit fresh fund above the June balance.,btohqsg
With exclusion of Amaze  does it mean cannot pair Amaze + UOB lady‚Äôs card to pay overseas hotel (Fcy) to earn 4mpd?  Any alternative to reduce or eliminate foreign transaction fees?,btohqsg
No other card can replace amaze currently.Just go down the ranking order of your existing cards striking out all amaze + Uob cards combo.,btohqsg
Basically it just means the Uob cards u used to pair with amaze are now 4% - 2.5% = 1.5% lousier.Sad yes but not doomsday.Uob lady 5/6mpd still very viable naked overseas.,btohqsg
Yes I'm still using my UOB lady. Just amaze will see more failed transactions üòÇ,btohqsg
Alternative is to buy it before 27 Sep.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  would greatly appreciate some clarity on UOB$ merchant spends.For UOB One and UOB Evol credit cards  I recognize that spends at UOB$ merchants are not eligible for cashback (save for Dairy Farm group). However  do spends at UOB$ merchants nevertheless count towards the minimum spend requirements do these cards?The UOB CSOs were inconsistent in their responses to above question and unable to point to relevant clause in T&Cs to substantiate their responses.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Who told you that uob$ merchants cannot contribute or earn cashback for Uob one cards?,btohqsg
I would phrase it as suchUob one cards are immune to uob$ issues that miles card face.Uob miles cards that award miles based on the unaggregated spend entry will not earn miles at uob$ merchants,btohqsg
Did you mean UOB$ awarded transactions? If you're not awarded  you are eligible for the card's own cashback  if you're awarded  it's still counted as spending.,btohqsg
Potentially silly question so I hope you‚Äôll bear with me.Do you withdraw out the $2.30 daily earned interest in Chocolate Finance @$20k?,btohqsg

There is app and SMS notification as well üòÖ. And it ask me to do an app reset,btohqsg
But I just performed a inward transfer on Saturday üòê,btohqsg
This is most likely legit based on what u shared. To confirm  check the email headers to see the origin of the email. If u are not sure how to check or can't confirm  do not click on links presented in the email or open attachments attached (if any),btohqsg
Right now only UOB absolute cashback gives rewards for grab top up (0.3%),btohqsg
I got the email  app and sms notification too.,btohqsg

Hi guys  could I check if the bank balance in a normal uob bank account is also considered for the uob nation of savers please? I am not sure if that is considered as uniplus savings account,btohqsg
It is  but unwise to do so because the amount that is going to be earmark/stuck inside has very negligible base interest earnings. Imo  since its going to be earmark/stuck  why bother to utilise a low earnings account type? Better to go with uob one or stash acct  easily >3%,btohqsg
Oh yes I am planning to go for uob one account but I am thinking should I be opening an uob one account and putting 150k in or how do I calculate the amount.,btohqsg
Hi experts who uses endowus  currency is in HKD?,btohqsg
Just open and put money in  register for nation saver too.,btohqsg

Since Amaze + UOB krisflyer cannot be used  what should I use for large overseas spending? Trust  Youtrip?,btohqsg
Trust for me. the exchange rates are pretty close with Youtrip and I don't have to worry about loading the card. Another youtrip like solution (more convoluted though) is ichange  if you are lucky to get your stuff processed (notoriously slow),btohqsg
Just fast transfer 2k in can already. Not need put salary,btohqsg
Do you think is good to pair Amazon and Citi Premier Miles to get 1.2 Miles?,btohqsg
you mean for foreign spend? why not?,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi will make it to local spending instead of foreign. So it will be 1.2 miles instead of 2,btohqsg
Probably  is too low and not worth,btohqsg
True but I think there is some calculation of fcy spread Vs mile value or something,btohqsg
Userkchas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:do not pm others with your referral code unnecessarily. This is the last warning.,btohqsg
lemme do the math. Take 1k equivalent sgd spend.naked citi: 32.5 sgd charge. 2271 miles earned (2.2mpd from 12 sep 24) => 1.43 cpmciti + amaze: 20 sgd charge. 1224 miles earned (1.2mpd) => 1.63 cpmdisclaimer: didnt take into mastercard fee but the results wont be much different.,btohqsg
your disclaimer holds if you are only fighting among cards that have the same 0.8% visa/master/amex feeyou need to really break down into all the raw components if you want to fight against Cash or Youtrip  or Ichange for example.,btohqsg
I don't agree. Early Aug I went to US  the average Amaze rate is 0.7376 vs Trust rate 0.7515 for each SGD.,btohqsg
amaze+card has about 2% markup over Amaze wallet,btohqsg
Yeap.Any advantage to use Amaze wallet vs Youtrip (wallet) or Trust (credit card)?Guess most use Amaze + card for miles?,btohqsg
Wow. And it‚Äôs still better exchange rate than Trust?I wonder if the new Trust Cashback card has a different exchange rate compared to the old Trust link card.,btohqsg
so Trust is better? yea  I have found that to be case in most places compared to Amaze. I was comparing with Youtrip,btohqsg
I have been using trust heavily for overseas spend ..their rates are superb,btohqsg
wait I am confused now. 1 SGD giving you 0.7376 USD is worse than giving you 0.7515 USD right? üòê,btohqsg
amaze wallet has good rates and instapoints. But Trust cashback card is better now with the 1%,btohqsg
EGA is super confusing ..except their 1% Giro cash back,btohqsg
yes but get rewards on card linked to amaze,btohqsg
yea that is for the miles people for sure. especially with Citi rewards from what I understand,btohqsg
cashback also can  e.g  can get 8% on maybank family and friends if use for eligible mcc,btohqsg
Oh ya. U are correct. That means he was paying more when using his Amaze.,btohqsg
Has anyone here checked if the new Trust Cashback card has exchange rates as good as the old Trust link card?,btohqsg
the FX rates info for the cashback on their website leads to the same place as the old card,btohqsg
Yeah. I saw this. Just asking if really using the card is the same,btohqsg
But how you know you already qualify Everyday+ Rewards Programme,btohqsg
Nope  Amaze currency rate will be more than Trust  but less than bank.,btohqsg
In my survey  Trust on par with Youtrip.Amaze with mark up but you get mile points,btohqsg
I just fast transfer 5 time to my other bank and deposit 2000 to account . How long I will get the message ?,btohqsg
Yes  you are right.So with Amaze you need to pay more when settlement (in SGD),btohqsg
Hello! Was wondering if there's any card that can award 4mpd for a retail contactless transaction at Janpaul (ring company)  am considering these options:UOB preferred platinum visaUOB Lady's cardThank you!,btohqsg

Thanks! I saw that UOB also holds a minimum of $15k uni$ in your account  is there any other bank that doesn't have this restriction?,btohqsg
There will always be examples where payment method A win or payment method B win.Most important is majority of the time which one wins. And ideally before a big transaction u do the same check again before u do the transaction.Days where there had been a big fx spike up or down. Or weekends. Are usually when such instances occur.,btohqsg

Can you increase 500 balance a month? If yes  ocbc has better rate. if no  UOB .,btohqsg

This SMS is from Aug round. For Sep round you will be qualified till Oct.,btohqsg

Any idea if I were to port back to OCBC 360 from UOB on the 1st day of the month will I get the interest ? As I recall OCBC interest is credited after salary is credited,btohqsg
From what i understand  3.x% is referenced to a reference month (which is the month before your sms registered). If u registered in Aug  then Sep's MAB - July's MAB = amount that earns 3.x% this month.And for the 1% bonus interest  the incremental is referenced to previous month of each month. So Sep's MAB - Aug's MAB = amount that earns 1% this month.Please correct me if I'm wrong. I also learning. üòÖ,btohqsg
Is there a check box for this or something?,btohqsg
You have to opt in with form for auto convert.,btohqsg
Your interest will be credited next month anyway. As long as you fulfill all the req in that month.,btohqsg

Hi  I registered and qualified for August HSBC EGA promotion. Do I still need to do the $2000 transfer and 5 transactions for September to trigger the 1% giro cashback? If so  how long must I leave the $2000 in the account?,btohqsg

Hello guys  may i know what is the best way to pay for dining in China?Does crmc + amaze with amaze link to alipay works to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
By right u dont need to. But no harm just transferring in and immediately out. Dont need to keep inside.,btohqsg
Yes ur understanding is correct. But make sure its not under exclusion. (And yes  its the posting date that counts  not the date of transaction  mentioning just in case in future u decide to spend on the last day of the month  high chance it will end up posting on the next month),btohqsg
PSA: For those with OCBC 360 and who deposit exactly $500 at first day of month  it wont work this month. You should deposit >$517.24. To have MAB increase by exactly $500. (But still  please add more buffer and not live on edge),btohqsg

Which SC card gives rewards for insurance premiums?,btohqsg
4 miles per dollar on max $1-2k spend per monthhttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/ladys-card/index.page,btohqsg
If he has savings with UOB  only UOB One  EVOL & Lady‚Äôs can clock the $500 spend. So One would still be needed. He can get PPV for spendings after the $500 mark on UOB One.,btohqsg
For that amount  shop usually ok to split lah,btohqsg

Hello  I signed up for July EGA. Will i still be eligible for Sept EGA?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I used Maybank Platinum Visa to pay $1k insurance using cardup. So the eligible spending is $1k or $500?,btohqsg
Card up is consider normal spending loh,btohqsg
üëç so the criteria of half the spending tier for insurance don't apply as long as i pay via cardup. Right?,btohqsg
Would that depends on how much cash he wants to deposit as well please?,btohqsg

Hi sorry I have a silly math qn which I can't seem to solve. I have the UOB Ladys card with category Travel. The bonus caps at $1k travel spending and each $1 is 10 UNI$.So my bonus UNI$ should be$1000 / $5 x 10 = 2000 UNI$ correct?I hit the travel cap every month but the max they give me is 1800 UNI$ at the end of each monthDoes anybody know if my calculation is wrong? Or shld i reach out to UOB?,btohqsg
You got 1x when transaction was posted then 9x at the beginning of the month. Hence max at 1.8k uni$,btohqsg
You need to understand Lady rewards have two categories: base UNI$ and bonus UNI$.Base UNI$ is 1x or 0.4 miles.Bonus UNI$ is 9x or 3.6 miles.Your calculation is wrong because you use Bonus UNI$ 10x,btohqsg

Actually I always wondered what‚Äôs the actual percentage of HSBC EGA participants who actually end up getting the promised 3.x% + 1%.Clearly the tncs are not easy to navigate and spread out over more than 1 documents. Also it is intentionally (in my view) confusing and not easy to understand. Also I feel it is not easy to teach someone to follow exactly.Suspect the product manager team is smart to make it such that not everyone will get what‚Äôs promised due to ownself mess up. And this is why the program is still sustainable.Otherwise I am unsure how they can sustain the payout rate.Like Uob finally surrender and killed off amaze + Uob.,btohqsg

Kerry sorry  hoping on this toosay we deposit 2k for salary to 360. for the Save component  i'd like to confirm  we still have to add another 500 on top of the 2k to increase the monthly average balance by 500 from the previous month?,btohqsg
2k salary can contribute to 500 save component. I usually withdraw out and leave just enough for 500 increase.,btohqsg
thanks Anthony! a follow up question.. i used the calculator on the 360 page and set ADB to be 1 000 and checked off the Salary and Save components  it's roughly 3.28%. how does one get 4.05%?,btohqsg
Becos you get different interest rate at higher/different ADB tiers. Try keying in 100k for ADB. U will see the 4.05%,btohqsg
3.28% for first 75k. You put 100k the result will be different.,btohqsg
"Just to note  ur 2k is not ""deposit"" by yourself. Becos it wont work  unless its by corporate account deposited as salary.Individual days of incremental amount doesnt equate to the actual increase in the ADB. U need to calculate your ADB like thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/217619",btohqsg

The TnC mentioned 1 new version boost pocket at anytime. But this new boost pocket is not the same as the previous boost-savings pocket.Thus  I can have the previous boost-savings pocket created in July  and 1 new boost pocket based on my interpretation. I don't have money for the new boost pocket so cannot try yet.,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGJust to share that putting directly into h**c gif ultra short duration bond reaped higher return of 5.9867% / annum between 2 August to 3 Sep over 33 days for me.

You should be careful when you deposit money into Revolut as they are not a proper bank. Your fund will not be protected. I summarized what happened to me last night.https://x.com/JAKEGLH/status/1831185160458453446,btohqsg
I think you can use crmc citi rewards master card. And you can use it directly in these scenarios since these are all online and you can get 4 mpd for a monthly cap of 1000$. Additionally there are no minimum spend requirements and in the long term you can find additional usage with Instarem Amaze as well,btohqsg
I read through ur posts. Revolut can be clearer for sure. Buts it's also scary you 1 shot that much to revolut acct.,btohqsg
Any advice for the OCBC MyOwn Account?Is there able to set a limit for chid‚Äôs spending,btohqsg

I interested to know. But not interested to sign up to Xthread. Care to share the opinions here?,btohqsg
I reviewed your X thread. I didnt see anything wrong with Revolut. They could be clearer with their instructions. You kept everything in ur normal account so the transfer back to dbs account is per regulatory requirement.,btohqsg
In summary  revolut has normal and flexible accounts. Flexible account has some promo interest for USD amount. Bank transfer will go to normal acct. Normal acct cannot hold more than 20k sgd so remember transferring to flexible acct right away.DISCLAIMER: This is not endorsement for Revolut.,btohqsg

"Is cpf interest ""compounded"" this word ""compounded"" monthly w new total or 3 monthly?",btohqsg
Google answer is interest computed not compounded.,btohqsg
TLDR: very lugi method.CPF interest is calculated monthly based on the LOWEST balance of the month.CPF interest is only credited once a year.Thus  there is NO monthly compounding.Thus  there is only ANNUAL compounding of the interest credited.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/how-is-my-cpf-interest-computed-and-credited-into-my-accounts,btohqsg
Computed monthly based on lowest balance.Compounded annually,btohqsg
So 1k monthly into SA  4% is 12 months x 1k is 480. Then new total following yr is 12480 +(12k) *1.04% will get new capital 25 459.20 correct?,btohqsg
err no..better use excelJan = $0 (lowest balance)Feb = $1000etc...Dec = $11000each cell you x 0.04 / 12Total interest for the year is the total of the 12 cells.Sure will have some rounding errors.,btohqsg
Any tips for SQ waitlist?High peak to JapanOr just ignore pick confirm list?,btohqsg

for high peak  waitlist will be very unlikely to clear,btohqsg
waitlist usually needs the confirmed holder(s) to cancel their ticketit is unlikely (not impossible) for airline to release additional seats.,btohqsg
you gotta redeem way in advance for JP during peak.,btohqsg

Ya overseas not all places accept applepay,btohqsg
it was very painful in Japan when i ran out of relevant card limits and had to fall back on my second UOB Visa Signature which I only had in my apple pay..end up i had to rely on Maybank Horizon Visa Signature (2.8mpd) which I brought as my ultimate backup (lousier than UOB VS 4mpd),btohqsg

Now that UOB doesnt earn points when linked with amaze  what other mastercard do you use for general spending when overseas  excluding Citibank rewards?,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how UOB cc payment works? My prev statement is 2sept I have paid off all minimum due but have about 1k+ still owed  will my next due date be 2oct? And if I spend more now  will it be due 2oct statement or 2nov statement?,btohqsg
Minimum 7 days to hold.There was 6% fund coupon for August for those who buy bonds but I don't see any coupon to redeem now  promotion must be ended.,btohqsg
why are u paying the minimum due? u wanna rack up interest?,btohqsg
Oh doesn‚Äôt it only charge interest if I miss the due date?,btohqsg
Omg  I thought some jp shops only accept card not Apple Pay is because they let you place a card on the tray and they tap it for you. And it is kinda stupid to put phone on the tray.ü§°,btohqsg
u are supposed to pay off ur statement in full each month. this applies to all banks.if u only pay minimum due  u will still incur interest charges.if u don‚Äôt pay at all  u will incur interest charges and late payment fees,btohqsg

Mt already gave you a decent option.

Good morning all gurus  could I confirm that crmc rewards are based on statement month please? My apologies but could I also ask does statement month refers to the statement cycle please? Or is it still by month please? Thank you.,btohqsg
To add onto what the folks shared. If didn't pay a credit card bill in full  interest would also be charged onnew transactionsof the card that has not been billed as well.,btohqsg
My experience is by the next business day. If u r using DBS as the agent bank for your CPF OA Investment scheme  the interest rate is 0.05% (anyone know the interest for OCBC and UOB?). Given that the OA interest CPFB gives us is much higher than the agent bank  I wouldmanuallytransfer back to my CPF OA at the earliest opportunity rather than wait for 20 Sep or the end of the month,btohqsg
Then you just contradicted yourself. If DBS gives interest for keeping it in CPF-IA  it would be better to keep it till the end of month before transferring back to CPF-OA. At least you're getting some interest from DBS for keeping it in CPF-IS.,btohqsg
Sorry  can I check roughly how many days for it to get posted with crmc direct? Charged on 2 Sep. Still pending  today cut off for statement liao.,btohqsg
Thanks! I see where u r coming from. But I am a forgetful person so I won't want to risk missing out the 2.5% p.a interest to earn 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Giving advice to not risk is one thing  but telling people that transferring near end of month gets you lesser interest isfactually incorrect.P.S. UOB CPF-IA gives daily 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
I think u misunderstood. I'm not telling people what to do. If u refer back to my post  I said 'Given xxx  I would yyy'. I am sharing what I would do and laying out the reasoning.,btohqsg
If you have monthly premiums  then Maybank Platinum Visa  whether with CardUp or not.,btohqsg
Thanks what about HSBC revo/ Citi cashback with ega instead,btohqsg
Why HSBC Revo card/Citi Cashback card? I pay my Maybank Platinum Visa card through GIRO on HSBC EGA for additional 1% cashback as well.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution + EGA will get you 3.5% Cashback. No annual fees  no min spending. Cap 1k for insurance monthly/yearly premiums,btohqsg
I bought the 1 year T-Bill using my CPF OA fund earlier this year. Can i ask what do u mean by being notified? Wanna understand your expectations to better share my experience,btohqsg
I thought HSBC REVO is a miles saving card,btohqsg
Where's the 3.5% cashback from? Assuming 1% is from HSBC EGA  where's the other 2.5% from?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is a points saving card. Points can be converted either to miles or for shopping.,btohqsg
insurance excluded from earning any points/rebate,btohqsg

I recently bid for the 6-month tbill that had auction date on 29 Aug and issue date 3 Sep. Just wanted to find out if there is any way for me to see the status of my bidding  as I don‚Äôt see any change or update when I check my cpf-is account on ibanking and my cpf dashboard,btohqsg
Did u submit a Competitive or Non Competitive Bid?,btohqsg
If until now still haven‚Äôt deduct  something is wrong,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing I was unsuccessful then,btohqsg
Ohhh ok. Is your bid above or below cut off yield?,btohqsg
Hi  just like to ask if the McDonalds in-store n McDelivery are the same and would I get rebate if I used my uob one debit card.,btohqsg
Paisay.. Your competitive bid is unsuccessful. That's why you are not seeing anything,btohqsg
Yeah no worries. Thanks for your replies,btohqsg

Giro bill payments for cc need setup or can temporary manual pay other bank cc?,btohqsg
For insurance premium be it life  car  health  travel  etc‚Ä¶ there are plenty of exclusions on credit card getting cash rebates  miles etc. Anyone has any suggestion which card does not have exclusion or what do you all do to clear this obstacle?,btohqsg
You can read up on cards like Maybank Platinum Visa and services like CardUp.,btohqsg
hey guys wanted to check  the visa signature card when used together with: 1) kris+ 2) shopback (f&b merchants) does it still give you 4mpd?,btohqsg
No. Those are online so not eligible.,btohqsg
thanks! UOB preferred plat is more versatile in comparison to visa signature for this use 2 case,btohqsg
Hi wrt new moomoo accounts  I understand that it may take up to 3 days for account to be setup after registration.There is an option to transfers funds in now. However  should I wait for moomoo to confirm that account has been setup before funding? When does the 30 day 6.8% start?,btohqsg
Wait for the account is better,btohqsg

are we allowed to use cashback for mortgage,btohqsg
how do you justify paying the fee to cardup versus the miles received ? which has higher roi in monetary terms,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of mile then calculate from there. Short answer is that if yours is below 1.25c per mile  its usually not worth.,btohqsg
Is there any formula to calculate your valuation of miles?,btohqsg
old article but gives you an idea of how to calculate,btohqsg
With mortgage on CardUp  I charge more than $60k into the Vantage card annually so the annual fee waiver is guaranteed.I get free hotel stay plus 10 priority pass visits for my family when we fly together.The fees if using promo code till end of December is 1.75% HOME175 and will see if they offer something else upon expiry.I pay via giro on EGA so I get 1% cash back.Essentially I‚Äôm paying $0.0075 service fee per dollar for ~1.5miles.,btohqsg

Does Citi rewards award points for dinning?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGHi Chris  i am checking with Long Bridge on the exclusively rewards $18 cash coupon  but Long Bridge said need to check with event channel  they are not sure on this promo...may i know how should i get that rewards? i've depo in $2k & performed 3 Buy trades. Thanks.,btohqsg
No. Don't add Citi rewards to apple pay. Citi excludes that all together. Gotta use amaze to circumvent that.,btohqsg
Have you fulfilled the holding period of 30 days?,btohqsg
notyet.soafter 30days  it will auto depo in?,btohqsg
After 30 days if not rewarded then complain to online chat,btohqsg
Ya Kris+ is online. But it‚Äôs using applypay. Does it mean no bonus reward because hsbc revolution now no more 10x point for contactless payment no?,btohqsg
Apple pay via Kris+ is online. Apple pay to terminal is mobile contactless. Learn the different. So HSBC Revo with Kris+ will work assuming mcc is right.,btohqsg
Will amaze with Apple Pay give rewards? Or have to present physical card?,btohqsg
