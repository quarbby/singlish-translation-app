Good evening Mr Anwo  today was a rather cooling day relative to yesterday,btohqsg
this reminds me of Animal Farm somehow which was my literature textbook 2 years ago,btohqsg
I was out by Youngs at Oval today... too hot....,btohqsg
I got to feed you more volvo stuff otherwise I got attacked more often. Every time I utter Mazda I feel intimidated. I know this will elicit negative reactions.,btohqsg
mr X so clever.  soften the ground first before launching the artillery attack,btohqsg
I also like mazda  MX-5 is one of my dream cars too!,btohqsg
but we do love Mazda... legit. Just that I can only look and dream of my fav model---- RX7 FD,btohqsg
Or when I mention Tesla that resident Italian Giuliano will attack me,btohqsg
mmm fd3s is a work of art,btohqsg
Yeah  we dont enjoy having apex seal price as our favourites on our search bar,btohqsg
yes yes.. we need to feed him some pizza first perhaps.,btohqsg
you need to speak english sir... i don't know why but i read 's3x appeal' in your sentence,btohqsg

maybe coz I hungry from absorbing all the positive energy and knowledge from sgcm today,btohqsg

Although this was the best of the new era of BMWs,btohqsg
But alas  big grilles are a thing,btohqsg
the big nosetril dun look good aesthetically,btohqsg
I actually like the big nose,btohqsg
This is for Mazda users I want to ask if you use istop. I’ve come across many white scared to use for fear of failed starter. What’s  experience? I’ve been using it since day 1 and okay so far.,btohqsg
i dont use istop cos of beeing sked of a failed starter  but right  i dont like the feel of my car having to 'cough' everytime i remove my foot of the brakes HAAHA,btohqsg
As you use often it “coughs” less and becomes smoother. That’s my experience.,btohqsg
i am no fan for rotary,btohqsg
i think it is a mistake,btohqsg
For Racing ok.Unlimited potential 😝For street  many unburned petrol😅,btohqsg
i think mazda will give up quietly,btohqsg
these wheels look like the ones on e93 m3. csl wheels Y-spoke designs,btohqsg
