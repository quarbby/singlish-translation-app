No large grilles = no like,btohqsg
Why cars arenâ€™t using ipads as HUD,btohqsg
Oh i didn't know the f40 came in m135i guise. I thought all renamed to m140i,btohqsg
How do yall remember so much about cars,btohqsg
they downgrade M on the newer 1s to a 2.0L,btohqsg
Why did they sort of downgrade the f40 version,btohqsg
actually the old 230 coupe is damn cool,btohqsg
On video is faster then a35,btohqsg
is there even a new one?,btohqsg
M135i becomes the midrange b48  supersede the 130i.Then m140i gets the b58 and becomes the m150i hahahaha,btohqsg
but they wld probably still use B48,btohqsg
Yupp great car but very overpriced in Singapore,btohqsg
when u watch too many stage 1 2 3 videos and then realise you are looking at the wrong engine,btohqsg
If only pml brought in the 128ti,btohqsg
when you thought your N20 had the same potential as you B48,btohqsg
I mean  a base 1er is already 200k,btohqsg
how much you intend to down LOL,btohqsg
in this current coe climate  i think 50% down is most suitable,btohqsg
Must be nice buying a brand new car fresh from the oven,btohqsg
even if dont buy new car,btohqsg
if not you need to worry about selling at settlement price,btohqsg
LOL i think sg cannot even full loan legally,btohqsg
20k and below can down 30 for new,btohqsg
I always thought it was 30,btohqsg
20k and above must down 40,btohqsg
It was 20 when my family bought a brand new wish,btohqsg
Min down 30 for below 20k omvMin down 40 for above 20k omv,btohqsg
Just that dealers will increase the price on paper to make your loan go through,btohqsg
Wait so all the full loan and low down is,btohqsg
But if you down too much also not good. COE drop your resale also drop like siao,btohqsg
then the downpayment u cant even get back,btohqsg
i think 50 most suitable la for my appetite,btohqsg
You rich  ez for you to say,btohqsg
maybe... YOU ARE RICH!! then okay lor 70,btohqsg
Good enough equity in the car and the total interest you pay not the highest,btohqsg
but u down 70 your upfront even higher,btohqsg
really depends on your financial situation ba,btohqsg
Cannot down so much also because your opportunity cost in that money high,btohqsg
this one i cannot advice haha  i belong to#FULLLOANSQUADRON,btohqsg
Unless you really can throw away the 70 with a minor dent only,btohqsg
Down more loan then can approve,btohqsg
That one again based on your financial situation,btohqsg
you intend to down 70 loan 7 years ah,btohqsg
Loan approvals subjective to each person,btohqsg
Take max loan for low interest rate. Put your extra cash into a investment that has high returns than your car loan,btohqsg
40 to 50% down  low interest loan and use investments to cover your interest payments,btohqsg
That is the most idealistic way of running things,btohqsg
I think fixed d rates are about 2.5% now,btohqsg
i went out in the sun for awhile   can feel sunburnt,btohqsg
Car loan now could get 1.88% if you are lucky,btohqsg
