Some time I really feel that we are worse than Bangla here...,btohqsg
It is by law that companies have only until 14th of the month to pay cpf for last month‚Äôs salary. So technically Lalamove has until 14th feb which is v day coincidentally,btohqsg
If they are late they have to pay cpf interest which I doubt they will cos amount is big (so many drivers),btohqsg

I ever took one idiot customer from woodlands to tamp about $15 I mean okay since i have nothing to do . Guess what when I reached he don‚Äôt even dare to come out 7 ikea bag all packed with item smelly and heavy . End of the day do you think it‚Äôs even worth it ? He stated 7ikea bag only lol,btohqsg

Cancel already later kanna hold for 10-20mins plus rating down like it‚Äôs our fault,btohqsg
Live chat doesn‚Äôt give a shit about,btohqsg
Normally for myself  after i accepted the order  called customer for item description. If customer stated its just a small item and upon arrival its not as they mention. I will asked them to cancel and if cash i will asked them to pay me compensation of 50%. If credit no choice have to claim in live chat that is the worst waiting time ever.,btohqsg
Almost all my shit jobs  i got the compensation.,btohqsg
Ask and you shall be given haha,btohqsg
Tips of the day  called customer/sender before proceeding.,btohqsg
Do they really compensate u? I'm always skeptical abt cash order especially,btohqsg
I ever kena cash order. Few places. Only pay me after job done. Before I send the last job  call sender numerous times for payment but didn't pick up. Msg also never reply. Stuck for 30 mins dunno what to do. End up I fail the last job. (last job is a few bottles of wine delivery). Miraculously the sender suddenly call me ask my paynow no üòÅ. So what goods we send does matter.,btohqsg
Still say cannot fit can help dismantle,btohqsg
Yes but i dont have the tools ah,btohqsg
Drive car need bring trolley good enough still need bring tools along,btohqsg
Things are getting bigger for car now,btohqsg
Trolley already good enough. Tools a bit much lahh.,btohqsg
Ask me cannot fit help to dismantle the item,btohqsg
