How much harder is the math compared to h2 math,btohqsg
Now Iâ€™m questioning whether I should take Econs in uni,btohqsg
if youâ€™re comfortable with H2 math you should be fine for the math in econs,btohqsg
the concepts are either H2 level or not far off but itâ€™s more of understanding how theyâ€™re being used,btohqsg
I hated math but I can do h2 level math questions with a lot of practice. Itâ€™s like my aptitude is not very good but itâ€™s sufficient such that I was able to make up for it with attitude  but I kind of donâ€™t want to have to go through the suffering of spamming a lot of math qns again.,btohqsg
If I find that I hate other courses more then no choice but to just deal with the math in Econs I guess,btohqsg
Is it more of pure math calculus stuff than stats?,btohqsg

Is that how you normally ace your phy lab reports?!,btohqsg
imagine how many ppl alr know all her problems,btohqsg
and most of us cant rly do anyt other then reassuring her,btohqsg
i mean at a uni level you don't really have the luxury of spamming as many questions as you'd like. it's not like h2 where you basically have an endless supply. as a whole you gotta spend more time understanding the concept behind what you're doing bc there's the econs context to apply it to,btohqsg
eh now i wanna ask for practical advicehow do you forget someone you see every day ?,btohqsg
