Thats true then don't take at all hahaah,btohqsg
This job post very long Liao,btohqsg
Nobody is going to do that for 10 haha.,btohqsg
Correct just msg them since it's pooling we go with protocol withhin 4hours so they will change to regular or priority..let them learn if still on pooling then go by the protocol üòé,btohqsg
You should not feel bad. The user who book the order is the wan that should feel bad,btohqsg
The user ownself know breaking fast is important. Yet choose pooling order to save cost,btohqsg
Technically you‚Äôre not wrong if you follow the pooling protocol.,btohqsg
Don't take till they jack to regular,btohqsg
I only take pooling order when I stack 2 immediate order,btohqsg
If receiver asked  just let them know. I ever call out on the HBB and restaurant on the delivery type. After that they call me and feedback about why I do that. I said I do it to protect my own backside.,btohqsg
So 3 jobs at once? üò±,btohqsg
Which they won‚Äôt. Let them learn the hard way.,btohqsg
I take up to 4 but regular go 1st. Pooling can roller coaster,btohqsg
Technically bo salah mahh? But must follow protocol by the book.,btohqsg
Yes dun burst timing can already.,btohqsg
But some user really dun understand about pooling order. They chose the cheapest. That's why llm should not come out with so many options,btohqsg
This will only let user take advantage,btohqsg
Recommend jst don't take pooling at all boycott it,btohqsg
If U got other orders then you leave them inside your car when U go do your deliveries meh? Later come back your car gone üíÄ,btohqsg
2 regulars within 1 hour can finished?,btohqsg
Definitely possible  speaking from experience. Must know the postal code or at least pick up area must be nearby.,btohqsg
2picks n 2 drops. 4points quite tight@15mins/point. Unless all are nearby n same direction.,btohqsg
Just need to plan ur stack pickup pts near each other n drop off pts along same route/direction n not too far apart lor,btohqsg
Don't b like one drop east one drop west,btohqsg
One pick east one pick west,btohqsg
üòÇüëç I think now not much job can stack.üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Yes can for sure..as long as nearby..I usually aim for similar pick up points or similar drop off areas..,btohqsg
