The bill is already received . I dont want this card anymore . Thats why waive first or cancel first . I got no idea thats why,btohqsg
just cancel and the bank is obliged to zero off the fee  need to monitor to ensure they do that or ask for waiver then cancel,btohqsg
Request for waiver first. Request to cancel if waiver not approved,btohqsg
Ok thanks well ton & trazora,btohqsg

Hi! Late to the game but I have both OCBC and UOB accts. For tax payment via cardup  would you recommend ocbc 90n or uob prvi miles?Also  i read the ocbc 90n tnc that miles will not be earned for tax payments. Does it mean that cardup helps to convert it to another type of payment or smth?Apologies for the noob qn!,btohqsg

Hi all  just curious is DBS the only bank that charges DCC fee for refunded transactions?I always have issue with refunded transactions being charged DCC fee by DBS and in a way I was charged DCC fee twice.I know other banks like HSBC will automatically refund DCC fees for refunded transactions.Just curious if any other banks also charges DCC twice like DBS?,btohqsg
is it transaction in foreign currency or sgd?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in SGD but processed outside SG,btohqsg
Not the points conversion  more so on whether ive hit the 1k spending cap before my statement month ends,btohqsg
I always have issue with Mastercard payment on Agoda and it was processed in HK even though the currency is in SGDNo issue with Visa card thoughI have reached out to Agoda multiple times about this but they don‚Äôt see this as an issueAnd I will need to call DBS to refund the difference whenever there are refunded transactions from Agoda  and my recent request to refund DCC got denied by DBS and I have asked for them appeal again,btohqsg
If you are paying 1shot  i believe 90n has better earn rate for new to cardup (1.5% admin fee).Though  i think its better to pay income tax every month so you have better cash flow. Then uob prvi visa is better. Dont forget honey money sg has promo code for cardup.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I tried not to use Agoda as much as possible but their 18% rebate always has the best rate compare to other sites like trip or Expedia so I have no choice but to use AgodaAnd some times my plan change so I have to cancel rooms i booked on Agoda,btohqsg
Im paying monthly for tax. Ok will look for the promo code on cardup! Thank you!,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
If Excel is too inconvenient for day to day use I would suggest downloading a spend tracker app on ur phone  though that would require lots of manual input as well,btohqsg
Oh ya any reason why visa over mc for uob prvi?,btohqsg
For some categories  cardup has lower admin fee for sg issued visa cards. Less fee for the same (ish) miles earned.,btohqsg
Ok got it! Thank you so much!,btohqsg
Yeap pretty much still manual tracking  just looking out if anyone has a solution beyond that  lets say dobin? Not sure if u get to customise the statement month when it collates ur spendings,btohqsg
Maybe stupid question : since the JPY is at its lowest  what can I do to benefit from it? Just buy it and hold till it will come up ??,btohqsg

Hi! Can I ask for some reviews of the instarem amaze with citi rewards combo? Is it still considered as a 5% cashback card?,btohqsg
This is one of the rewards for signing HSBC live plus credit card.Does that means they will give me in a total of $600 in cash back?,btohqsg
Err no the last $500 they mean if you max out the cashback cap $250x2 quarters,btohqsg
Is 300 voucher from sjngsaver  100 cashback  the last one should be the max cashback from the card itself,btohqsg
Hmmm I will go study the tnc again‚Ä¶,btohqsg

This feature will be coming out soon! :),btohqsg
What's DCC? I also used Dbs recently on Agoda  later found out dbs charged an extra 1% as Agoda is based in HK. Other banks did not charge extra.,btohqsg
more accurately this is cross border fee. 1% fee for Payment in SGD but processed overseas,btohqsg

Hi  I'm currently only a HSBC card holder. If to apply for HSBC EGA  what would be the recommended way? I heard that I need to send a text for its promotional rate?,btohqsg
Hi can any gurus here please recommend a card that get good cashback/miles or any sort of benefit from spending in game purchases?because i can spend up to 1k monthly on average.,btohqsg
Citi rewards for miles/maybank plat visa for cashback,btohqsg
i been using citi rewards but i believe i called the citi hotline and they told me wont get 10x bonus.,btohqsg
Yes  all krisplus spending will earn 3mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
so i end up just using citi premier miles just to clock the normal miles. citi rewards doesnt work for google play store,btohqsg
Thats special feature of kris+. It will give 3mpd right away for any kris+ payment using uob kf,btohqsg
Have u try with citi reward before directly,btohqsg
Debit card can take up to 14 days to post transaction from merchant,btohqsg
"yeap. i applied for citi rewards just for this sake since it mentioned ""online spending""i called the citi hotline and ask them if my transactions for google play store  do i get 10x reward point. they say this merchant is not supported for the 10x",btohqsg
So u charge before to citi reward and it did not give 10x reward?,btohqsg
i used citi rewards for all inapp purchases i made and to make sure i get 10x i called citi hotline and ask them for all my google play store transactions  do i get 10x reward point  they say no.only the base amount because for the 10x reward point it must still be covered under the right merchant and google play is not under it,btohqsg
I understand what u are saying  what i am asking is did u check the bank app that it only give u base point after transaction is posted,btohqsg
hmm i didnt check the point how much it increase inside the app. i am not sure when is the right time to check as well  like immediately after a purchase was made?but if the citibank staff tell me it isnt  doesnt that mean it isnt?,btohqsg
Points will be rewarded when transaction is posted,btohqsg
really? then why would the citibank staff tell me i wont get it? i stopped using for months cause of that T_T,btohqsg
Because staff are human  they can make mistake too. Only u can monitor and test out system,btohqsg
To clarify  you paid for something from google store  didnt get points then you asked citi cso ans cso said no points rewarded?,btohqsg
citi cso said for google store transactions  they dont fall under the 10x reward point merchant,btohqsg
and i remember on my app  it wasnt pending status so it should be already charged. i cant remember was i asking for the month before or the month itself.,btohqsg
b4 looking into telegram  i tried to search online for any kind of card in sg that supports google play merchant but found nothing(i know of) so far.but i realize in countries like US  they do have credit cards that give bonus to google play transactions,btohqsg
It is just so damn that they stop google play card,btohqsg
Weird. I had 2 transactions on google play this month and both got 10x pts. Is yours 1 time payment or recurring?,btohqsg
I always do 1 time payment,btohqsg
@antonio191203could you mind telling me let's say you spend it now. At what point do you check if u got 10x? Maybe I shall try that,btohqsg
When the transaction is posted  i.e. no longer pending  in ur transaction history page.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know what purchases by Uob Debit card will enable you to get the fastest update in the Uob debit expenses?,btohqsg
Anyone know that the proper channel to lodge complaint against DBS for double charging DCC for refunded amount? Since I don‚Äôt think other banks are charging DCC fees for refunded amount,btohqsg
Have you talked to dbs cso? Uob did the same to my agoda refund üò¢,btohqsg
Yes I have contacted DBS multiple times to refund the difference previously and they never rejected my request until recentlyThe cso told me previously was all done out of good will hence I have asked the cso to file an appeal for this current case,btohqsg
Means total u lost 2% of transacted amount? 1% cross border fee when purchased hotel room via Agoda then another 1% cross border fee when u cancel this booking to get refund.,btohqsg
Only one way  open at branch. Setup signature also. Then submit GIRO arrangements. And register for bonus interest promo.,btohqsg
Imma try it again. Btw what was the rate again?,btohqsg
The rate? Just round down and x10. Like 5.25 transaction will give 50 pts.,btohqsg
You never pay through Google Pay right? Just using your card details to pay on Google Play?,btohqsg
Hi Sky  on Dobin you can enter your statement date manually and the spend will be automatically calculated and shown on a progress bar  see the screenshot,btohqsg
Hi. Any way to check if we have fulfilled the criteria for ocbc 360? Similar to what uob has for one account,btohqsg
Hi which is the best cash back card for ocbc 360 and which is the best cash back card overall in sg,btohqsg
Hi GurusI will be making several travel expenses over the next few months.  I am currently holding UOB Solitaire card with travel as one of my preferred categories.  I would like to check what other card would give me the best value either in miles or cashback for the excess expenses of $2 000 per month.  I have recently cancelled my DBS Woman‚Äôs card  so that would be out of question. TIA!,btohqsg
Oh sweet ill check it out! Thanks for reaching out,btohqsg
Crmc? As long you paired them both with amaze  you'll benefit from 4mpd and fairly ok exchange rates.,btohqsg
Thanks!  I will definitely look at CRMC + Amaze for overseas expenses.  I was referring to travel expenses mainly on hotel and air tickets.  Sorry I wasn't clear about it.,btohqsg
Dont seem to have those options üòß,btohqsg
Yes I was change 1% for original one transaction which I am aware and ok with this  but I can‚Äôt accept they charge me another 1% from the refunded amount. This DCC problem only happens with Mastercard payments on Agoda.Every time I have refunds from Agoda to my DBS MC I have to call DBS to refund the difference. It‚Äôs a hassle with Agoda + DBS that I have to go through. And last few times DBS just refunded the difference without saying anything. But the cso I contacted today told me they were done out of good will  so in a way they are telling me it is normal for them to charge DCC fee twice even for refunded transactions.And I cannot bypass the DCC fee using amaze since DBS excluded amaze transactionsSome times I have to cancel bookings due to plan change  some times due to better rates etc and Agoda don‚Äôt want to honour the best price guarantee since they told me I booked using the DBS CC promo,btohqsg
Probably can consider UOB KF  it‚Äôs lower at 3mpd but has no cap,btohqsg
Depends on what criteria you are looking at  salary and save bonus you are able to see from ocbc web. But ocbc doesn‚Äôt have a spend tracker to let you know which posted transactions actually counts but so long as it‚Äôs not under the exclusions it should be counted,btohqsg
The spend progress bar widget is only displayed for cards where there is min spend to reach for accelerated earn. So not on the Citi Rewards Card - We can add it in a future release though if useful? (Fyi  I am a co-founder at Dobin),btohqsg
Cool so the function is somewhat there  just need to enable it for crmc. Looking forward. üôèüèª (yea i dont think anyone would deliberately use a dobin logo dp ;) ),btohqsg
I'm on the same situation as you. Double charges on DCC.,btohqsg
hi gurus! if i paid my hsbc cc bill using uob account and it showed like this  means bill is paid right? just confirming thanks!! üôèüèª,btohqsg
Maybank platinum visa vs family & friend . Which card better ? thanks,btohqsg
Then don't use agoda or dbs  especially this exact combination! üòÖ,btohqsg
Its more of agoda in this case. Their payment gateway is outside of Singapore üòÖ. Or only book at agoda if you are sure you wont cancel.,btohqsg

Hi guys  any idea whether there is a waiting period before I can reinvest my cpfis monies again?,btohqsg
I tried as much as possible but most of the time the Agoda x DBS combo still have the best rate compare to others  which is about 10-15% better rateFor rates that are not too far off from DBS Agoda I‚Äôll use other platforms to avoid the DCC fee,btohqsg
I used DBS visa (livefresh card) and the payment gateway is in SG  then I now switched to miles with DWMC due to the nerf,btohqsg

I got the eliteplus status in HoteLux and titanium status in gha thanks to Citi prestige.However the hotel price + privilege is still not as good as if I booked fromtrip.comAm I missing something?,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm applying for my first CC and I am a little confused on the intarem amaze card strategy. Even Citi rewards is 1.2 miles per dollar and the Citi rewards points. How is it able to achieve 4mpd? Is it via purchasing of the miles using points later on in the rewards store ?,btohqsg
- Citi Premiermiles Mastercard is 1.2miles per $1- Citi Rewards MasterCard (CRMC) is 1 or 10 points per $1 (1 point is 0.4 miles)- Amaze ensures you get 10 points per $1 for CRMC,btohqsg
So in that case you get 10 points of Citi rewards points all the way. How is it 4 miles per dollar,btohqsg
citi allows you to convert citi points  let's say krisflyer  at 25 000 pts : 10 000 miles. 1$ earned 10 pts then can be converted to 4miles.,btohqsg
mainly benefits of status are room upgrade (subject to availability)  early check in - late check out (subject to availability) and earning more pts. If you dont see the diff  there isnt much else.,btohqsg

CIMB StarSaver good vs UOB one account for higher Saving interest? I want to hear üëÇ members view.,btohqsg
imo  cimb preferred does not offer much value for me. 250k in cimb starsaver to earn 3.5% pa. For the same amount  you can put 150k in uob one for 4% pa and 100k somewhere else to earn more.,btohqsg
But UOB one account must spend $500 per month  and giro $1600 to get higher than 4% interest$150K for $503 int per month (if all met).,btohqsg
personally i can fulfill the criteria for uob one acct. If you cant fulfill it  can look else where. Like ocbc 360 can get close to 4% pa with salary + save for about 100k. If you only have 250k  no salary and no cc spend  i guess can consider cimb starsaver.,btohqsg
Anyone here use cmc to buy lse stock? How compare to ibkr in term of exchange rate and commission?,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I‚Äôve selected transport as my UOB Lady‚Äôs Category. Will I get my 4mpd if I pump petrol at Shell? I searched up shell on heymax and it didn‚Äôt suggest my UOB Lady‚Äôs card. I know petrol is 5541 MCC  but I‚Äôm just wondering if Shell qualifies or would I have to pump petrol at other places. Cause Esso and Caltex suggests UOB Lady‚Äôs card when I search them on heymax.,btohqsg
Which benefit does courts give for citi smrt?,btohqsg
U get the 3.6 mpd coz shell is uob$ merchant thus no base point,btohqsg
So just to be clear  for Shell it will be 3.6mpd  but other petrol stations 4mpd?,btohqsg

Hi has anyone bought Gold elite secure from Tokio marine? According to the agent  if my policy is 100k  I can get $530 per month till I sold the policy. I can hold this policy as long as I like. The return will depend the market value that I sold. If I die  this policy can past down to my children.,btohqsg
Ask the agent is the $530 per monthguaranteed amounttill end of policy and start from which year u will get it. 1st year or 5th year or 10th year onwards.Is it the longer you get the monthly payout  the less you will get in the future.If the policy holder pass away how much valueof policy will past down to beneficiaries.I check the website  it is single premium (SP) whole lifeinvestment-linked plan.,btohqsg
1. I can get $530 the following Month i buy the policy2. I can get the money every month  till I want to sell the policy. How much I get the return will depend on the price that I sell. If the policy is higher than the purchase value  take the higher rate  if it is lower than it  take the original rate,btohqsg
Sounds a little too good to be true.,btohqsg
Rough check using the total points earned which is shown in the app then divide by the balance shown in app  should be 9.xx  close to 10x points then should be ok. If way less than 9x  then go to details and check.,btohqsg
Assuming you're only doing 100k single premium.1. It's an ILP with dividends. The monthly dividends depends on your policy value. Meaning if the fund value drops  the divendends drop as well.2. Policy value will 100% drop but not 100% increase. Because of fees disinvestment  see below.3. For the first 6 years  1.4% p.a. establishment charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly.4. As long policy is in-force  1% p.a. admin charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly.5. As there are death benefits (which is weird for a full-investment ILP  like AIA)  different % p.a. protection charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly  depending on your gender and age.6. You CANNOT surrender the funds without fees before the first 6 years.Assuming your policy value do not increase  and your agent's info of 6.3% p.a. of dividends  for the first 6 years  your dividends after fees are about $300 per month. Remaining years will be about $400 per month.Standard general views of ILP applies. You can search the chat for the general views of ILPs.,btohqsg

If it is investment linked plan  all figures shown are indicative only. You may get any amount as low as $100.Investment linked is not same as Fixed Deposit from bank.,btohqsg
yea desktop one is unstable  mobile works for me,btohqsg
The red flag of your agent is that the 2nd part applies only if life assured dies. Insurance companies are not so good to top-up the difference if your funds are losing monies.,btohqsg
Go ask your agent what if the fund crash like during Covid events. Who will bear the loss? My guess is they won‚Äôt know how to answer.,btohqsg

Hi Gurus. Does Amaze + Citi Rewards work for Groceries  e.g.  Fairprice  Cold Storage?,btohqsg

Hi guys. Anyone has any idea if travel is an exclusion for the 4mpd for UOB PPV? I've not been getting my 9x bonus,btohqsg
Hi everyone. I'm currently with UOB and have a UOB one card. I'm thinking to change to start accumulating miles.I have some huge expenses coming  due to house renovation and fittings.Appliances I'll likely be buying from Audiohouse in SG and furnitures will likely be in JB(foreign currency spend). Let's say for discussion sake  appliances will be $15k SGD and furniture 30k RM.I'm thinking of signing up the UOB Krisflyer card  pairing it with amaze card.Would this be the best strategy for me?Or would you have any recommendations for these bigger expenses?,btohqsg
Even the uob rep cannot answer my qns,btohqsg
online is Not mobile contactless. Travel is not whitelisted category for online 4mpd.,btohqsg
Serious? Then how should I pay via online website?,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt  since ppv doesn‚Äôt award 10x for online travel,btohqsg
Travel is not an excluded MCC as per T&C,btohqsg
online only give 4mpd for whitelisted MCCs,btohqsg
Travel is not an included online MCC as per T&C,btohqsg
Which tnc have you been reading lol,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see ppv in this list  and this is for promotion. Read up on ppv tnc before you start doubting,btohqsg
This is not UOB PPV's t&c. Did you try looking at their website?http://uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/preferred-platinum-visa-card.page,btohqsg
Then you should see online transactions are for specific mcc  if you don‚Äôt see your mcc of your travel tx inside  means no 10x,btohqsg
Depends on the travel agency. Only limited travel agencies are included. The rest are excluded from online.,btohqsg
So are you saying Excluded means 0 uni$?Not mentioned in excluded list  not mentioned in whitelist = 1x? Is that it?,btohqsg
Yes what you said is correct  but also is not what Mouse Hunter said.,btohqsg
Direct airlines mcc code is 3000 Series. Excluded from PPV online 4mpd.,btohqsg
So which cc is best for travel? I got WWMC  UOB ladys and UOB KF. Switching my UOB ladys to travel for July quarter,btohqsg

UOB ONE account base interest is in.UOB EVOL cashback too  for those who put statement date as end of month.,btohqsg
For EVOL  is the period by calendar month I.e. 1st to 31st?. I got a separate statement mid June after opening the account on 1st week of June and it doesn‚Äôt show me the period involved.,btohqsg
It's based on statement month. For those who put statement date as end of month like myself will receive cashback and statement for Jun today.Most people change the statement date so can synchronise with UOB One account calendar month period.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! So the rest will likely receive ours tomorrow? :),btohqsg
Depends what you put for your statement date.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt remember there being an option for me to select for the statement date when I applied at the start of June. Is there somewhere I can check or do I need to call UOB? Thank you!,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt Citi do something about all these fraudulent transactions?,btohqsg
Can. Block your card and give you new one. ü§™,btohqsg
Jialat. Always have to keep an eye on Citi card.,btohqsg
No need. Set alerts then you know already.,btohqsg
It chat bot is quite useless lol,btohqsg
Hmm‚Ä¶ ok  will explore where to set the alerts.,btohqsg
Ya you can set ur alert to 0.01$ for Citi card,btohqsg
You need to talk to agent,btohqsg
Can I pay hdb cash 5% down payment with credit card?,btohqsg
So I‚Äôve applied for EVOL on the 1st and got the card on the 9th. Spent $300+ on online bookings. And just found out that they have set my billing cycle on 12th monthly so my spending did not qualify for anything.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so weird that they set it on the 12th. So I should never start using the card immediately after receiving a new one?,btohqsg
Applied on 1st of June  got the card and activate it on the 9th. Stated using the card on 10th with SIA. Got the statement on the 12th which I was confused at first.,btohqsg
You need to meet the full min spending even if it is approved 1 day before your statement date. You still can receive 0.3% cashback on 11 Jul.,btohqsg
I am also not sure if the new EVOL change have already been implemented to my card because the change was only after my application but same day as my approval.,btohqsg
The chat assistant told me they only track ‚Äúone spending‚Äù for the first statement so it does not apply.,btohqsg
Depending when you were approved the card. Before 7 Jun  still old t&c.,btohqsg
Found how to do it alr. Set it to $2 . Thanks Bro &@MelvynEzitoo.,btohqsg
Checked t&c  even if your card is approved 1 day before the statement date  you will still need to meet the full minimum spend to qualify for the bonus cashback.,btohqsg
Why not 1 cent to cover all transactions? What if they spend $1.99 x 1000 times?,btohqsg
Yeah that sucks. Especially when they don‚Äôt tell you when your period is after you get your card. One would assume is started when you first activate the card.,btohqsg
Does this work on apps like shopee lazada too?I have been using amaze inside these apps and eating into my 1k monthly cap.Should i add crmc directly instead? Thanks,btohqsg
Heard that DBS excluded Atome transactions. UOB One card still eligible?,btohqsg
Yes  just use crmc direct on local websites/app. Don‚Äôt waste the 1k limit.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also new here so learning along.My personal take is why wanna charge overseas purchase onto credit card. Citi card and many others do charge a service fee for every overseas transaction.Other Bros/Sis here. Wu Hua meh to chase miles for overseas purchases esp big amounts? I‚Äôm not sure as usually for overseas  depending on where I am  I put them on Trust  youtrip or Revolut.,btohqsg
Hi  if I pay kopitiam with fair price  app  I should be using CRMC instead of amaze linked CRMC right? Fairprice app also considered online?,btohqsg
Because Amaze converts them to local spend with a small FX spread and can still net you 4mpd on many cards. Overall net positive with the rewards earned. Why bo hua?,btohqsg
Fairprice app is online but you need to input the card details  not paying via apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
Should never link CRMC to those anyway ü§™,btohqsg
Still not out.. when will it be announced,btohqsg
For existing Evo cardholder in July we can still enjoy normal cb right ? Think read somewhere the nerf will be from Aug ?,btohqsg
If use amzae overseas will this eat into 1k cap?,btohqsg
Wow! Time to look into it Liao. Thanks for the info.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is any merchant where the posting date is the same date as the transaction date?,btohqsg
Wow great. Have been using youtrip all the way overseas due to better rates n fx spread. Will change to amaze now.,btohqsg
amaze inflates their spread rate tho,btohqsg
Still a net positive if you can get 4mpd.,btohqsg
yup  just putting it out there,btohqsg
Always good to have YouTrip along to withdraw money from ATM and as a backup card in case Amaze linked card fails.,btohqsg
Agoda posted one of my transactions on the same date when I bought a ticket in Korea‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Pls try to be specifc when giving advice as there is a requirement to get 3mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Any news on UoB promo for Jul-Sep promo?,btohqsg
It just means you're not equipped to be using OCBC 360 account effectively. As long you have to take money out for spending (so cannot guarantee Save bonus)  and if you don't have at least 75k (very low interest rate)  the account is one of the worst you can have.Imagine having to put in twice the effort  but get worse then Maribank.,btohqsg
Wait for people to update at midnight or tomorrow haha,btohqsg
I reset to 100k every year  I think still okay for the rate,btohqsg
Did you read the whole message?,btohqsg
I tried to understand the calculation but I still can't understand when should I be doing the reset. I only fulfill salary and increase MAB of 500,btohqsg
Increase more than 500  maybe $505 or 510  to be safe,btohqsg
Yes  don‚Äôt use ocbc 360 for daily usage,btohqsg
Importantly is it have to do all 3 criterias to make it with it. Without spend criteria you'll need to reset twice a year just to be above 4% p.a.,btohqsg
I mean is it worth to do a reset if I hit 104k or can I wait till 106k etc. I understand I be losing interest on the 4 or 6k but ain't sure where can I be getting a better rewards on them,btohqsg
Because I am seeing I need to spend 500 to get 50 more per month thus I am spending it on my uob one account instead,btohqsg
None. Look at the excel I tagged you on.,btohqsg
Can spend with ocbc card too,btohqsg
I'm assuming because you have 150k and it's earmarked in UOB One for either 4.5% p.a. or 6% p.a.?,btohqsg
Did you see the excel table in#ocbc360eir? Why are you recommending someone to go below 4.5% p.a.?,btohqsg
And I can't hit 1k spending per month unfortunately,btohqsg
No  I use my own calculations üòÄ,btohqsg
Yup I did previously but too noob to understand it fully haha,btohqsg
Usually my monthly increase around 500.xx to 501.xx,btohqsg
I ran the number a few times and I dont see how reset at 106k will be optimal. And you reset every year?,btohqsg
Maybe you can look into other accounts with at least 4% p.a. without the spend category. Something like HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
My reset is simply withdraw to 100k,btohqsg
"That's why that number does not appear on the excel table. It's not even close to ""decent"".",btohqsg
Imagine having over 2k sitting in a bank earning 0.05% p.a.Put with Maribank also better rates.,btohqsg
When you reset  you should withdraw it below 100k. Anything above 100k is ocbc 360 only earns 0.05% pa. Like Melvyn said  that money can be put elsewhere for better interest.,btohqsg
4 or 5 items still 0.05%  what for?,btohqsg
Any comments on Endowus higher income portfolio? Div around 5.5 -6.5,btohqsg

Maybe you can use OCBC Rewards card and buy $500 worth of vouchers onHeymax.aito clock the spend. Then on alternate months  put the monies in HSBC EGA  and spend the vouchers.Would be great if your family members have spends that can use those vouchers as well  so that these vouchers don't accumulate.Bonus is you get to clock miles and max miles.,btohqsg
hello all  can double confirm if i cancel my citibank credit card  i have to wait another 12 months to be recognized as new customer?,btohqsg

Increase max cap from $2m to $3m (doesn't matter since HSBC Everyday+ Rewards caps bonus interest at $300  max $360k)3. Conflicting info of increment ADB in Jul and Aug but bonus interest earning period is only in Jul. Does it mean need to keep the incremental ADB in Jul and Aug  just to get 1 month of bonus interest?4. Any funds withdrawn within last 30 days will not count as fresh funds (i.e. entire month of Jun) - same as UOB earmark promoMust really reconsider to participate if you transferred funds out on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
does anyone know why the uob one cash rebate is only 133.33? and the additional rebate is only 200?,btohqsg
prorated rebate for 2months of first quarter,btohqsg
the prorated is based on calendar quarter?,btohqsg
If I visit gain city  make payment and require installment plan. Am I just able to gain the mile for the card?,btohqsg
Did you miss 1 statement month?,btohqsg
the thing is never missed statement month   but i did change my statement dates from 12 to last day of every month,btohqsg
Is the instalment plan by services like Atome  gain city or in conjunction with the bank? Instalment plan like Atome still possible  with bank then no.,btohqsg
i applied during 28 march received about 7 april. Then changed the date to last date of every month.So my statement dates are 1st apr - 30 apr   may 1 - may 31  then june 1 to june 30  by right today should be the end of my 3rd statement,btohqsg
Meaning they bill you instead of setting up the installment through bank,btohqsg
Okay understand. So if I using a uob card and apply for 0 percent interest thru the bank is no right,btohqsg
The first statement quarter is always messy. Last time got similar conversation.It might become 1 - 31 Mar  1 - 30 Apr and 1 - 31 May. Because you're only supposed to receive the cashback on the end of the next statement month  and because you received in Jun  it's likely you missed Mar.But already better than those who change the statement month after first statement quarter  because they don't get the prorated benefit.,btohqsg
so in this case june will be my 1st   july 2nd   august 3rd  then when reaching the end of sept then the cashback will show up in my statement right?,btohqsg
Yup. Not sure if you can check with CSO on your statement quarter period.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtsupposed you already pull funds out yesterday/friday to another bank?,btohqsg

Can't verify their MCC. But Heymax said its 8099 which is not whitelisted under UOB beauty category.,btohqsg
Go n make another $1 payment using Amaze empty wallet method to verify the mcc.,btohqsg
If I've withdrawn my EGA funds on 1 June  theoretically if I sign up and move the funds back in on 2 Jul  it should be considered as fresh funds right?,btohqsg
No. Promotion starts on 1 Jul.,btohqsg
But it was not withdrawn within the last 30 days what...,btohqsg
Hahaha need more data points to see if they really have system to do it.,btohqsg
T&Cs didn't state past 30 days within start of promotion period. It just says past 30 days.,btohqsg
Its veey hard to understand the wording,btohqsg
Can register  referral link can be found@sgpromocode,btohqsg
You can try and provide the dp in Oct üò¨,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ they can always claw back after Oct when they find a way to do it.,btohqsg
This is hsbc I don‚Äôt think they know how to clawback,btohqsg
Your faith in them is so low. ü§£,btohqsg
They do everything manually one. Even bonus interest is manually calculated with excel I heard,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why their bonus interest (last time) is credited over a few days. lol.Maybe now changed la.,btohqsg
Hi all  Would like to check something.. I have used my amaze+CRMC overseas  first 2 transactions were ok. But suddenly it got blocked. Is it because Citibank or Amaze? Anyone face the same issue before while overseas ?,btohqsg
HAHAHA. Maybe now different liao la. So many people how they calculate manually. I see their cashback quite fast and accurate  I'm sure they have invested in a new system.,btohqsg
Amaze. That's why you should always have backup card like YouTrip.,btohqsg
Oh I see.. what should I do if I‚Äôm back in sg? Email / Call Amaze or Citibank,btohqsg
Agree with this but YouTrip should be ultimate backup since no rewards.Usually it‚Äôs a 4-6 mpd card with amaze at the forefront for me.Then amaze + crmc as backupThen Uob vs as backupAll fail then YouTrip,btohqsg
I was thinking is it because I didn‚Äôt get to authorise the transaction in time from Citibank app that‚Äôs why Amaze block,btohqsg
Anyone knows if moomoo has already announced their new promotions for July ? 6.8% will continue ?,btohqsg
Oh? Got such thing? Citi sent u something,btohqsg
Ya got notification to authorise transaction,btohqsg
Then u have your answer Loh.Interesting though. I never got any in app approval request while using amaze.Only when linking with amaze first time.,btohqsg
Ya I didn‚Äôt get it before too and only this time.. just feeling helpless overseas but thanks   will call Citibank up,btohqsg
Since amaze crmc no longer works. U can try delinking and relinking crmc with amaze now ,btohqsg
Uob vs naked the fx fees high right,btohqsg
Still positive.4mpd - 4% fx fee = positive benefit.,btohqsg
HSBC drunk while drafting T&C...so many logic inconsistencies. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
How about 2.4mpd fcy? Will u take this or use youtrip,btohqsg
Anyway those looking to register for Jul24 EGA BI  take note to do it after 9am tomorrow.,btohqsg
2.4mpd at 3.25% bank fee will work out 1.35 cents per mile. See your own value of miles and decide if its worth it.,btohqsg
Will be funding only on/after 3rd July into Jul24 promo EGA account.Just to be safe. Since last month June only withdrawed by 3rd June due to weekends.,btohqsg
Putting into eSaver for 1st - 3rd July holding first. Will still earn interest.,btohqsg
I started my investing into US ETF (VOO) 3 months back using syfe. Currently my holdings are around 2k SGD.I just found out that there's a 30% witholding tax for my dividends. Should I change to a Ireland ETF like CYPX with IBKR early with 15% tax or I should just stick to VOO?Please advice üôè,btohqsg
2.4mpd x 1.5 cents value - 4% fee = negative 0.4% benefitYouTrip better.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can we transfer krisflyer miles from one person to another (example husband to wife)?,btohqsg
Ya. Cso sick of people asking why the SMS acknowledge last month,btohqsg
Remember last round the SMS also send wrong text,btohqsg
Not 3.25% bank fee only. It‚Äôs 4% total fx charge if fight with YouTrip,btohqsg
Sorry im trying to do the calculation. Do u have a sample with real numbers to look at?,btohqsg
Which is also why I rather hold in e saver last few days of the month instead of withdraw EGA on first few days of the month.,btohqsg
Just use a fake $100 transaction and u can see the logic,btohqsg
Hi noob question does the citireward card mpd applies for shopee transactions? :),btohqsg
Really ? No lock in period for 30 days? They ll give proper rated  I guess,btohqsg
It‚Äôs calculated based on Daily Average Balances. So you earn for each day.,btohqsg
I am in the same boat  opened esaver 4th June but emptied HSBC same day so I better continue all July with SC ( i got pro rated 26 days of June interest and the ampaign is for 2 months at 3.5 roughly) then use EGA for August,btohqsg
0.75% fx spread is very generous of UOB eh. I thought it'll be 1.75% fx spread.,btohqsg
Can I move 22 K now to DBS to earn the 1.9% out of 50 K there ( currently have 27 there) then move after midnight to SC Esaver   worst case todays average get lower,btohqsg
Usually it is 3.25% bank fee and 0.8% master/visa/amex spread.The actual master/visa/amex spread observed depends on how fast they adjust their spread and how fast spot rate is moving.,btohqsg
Sorry don‚Äôt understand your question. üòÇ maybe can ask others to help.,btohqsg
Trying to verify 4% difference between youtrip and bank cc. Most of the online articles results are closer to 3% difference than 4%.,btohqsg
no  transfer on Sunday will be dated on Monday,btohqsg
Wrong. If you keep 100k for only 3 days in Jul  your ADB for Jul is 9677. But you will still earn the daily interest  not the full bonus interest for 100k incremental ADB.,btohqsg
Actually mab and adb concept usually ends up with same interest amountExceptFor situations where they cap max adb or mab for interest calculations. Very rare I think only one bank did that.,btohqsg
Anyone able to set up giro on HSBC EGA for DBS car loan? I'm able to find the giro form for credit cards only.,btohqsg
Bank fee will be 3.25-3.5 generally liao so 4 percent difference not too far off,btohqsg
Yes  but OP said he will leave funds in from 1 to 3 Jul  then withdraw the funds from the account.,btohqsg
Yes he will still get the 3.xx% pa interest for the 3 days in e saver.Which works out to be the same as 3.xx% pa x the mab of the esaver.,btohqsg
How come won‚Äôt earn the bonus interest for incremental ADB?SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Because those articles use fx spread of 3.25%.There were lengthy arguments both ways in milelion chat and I hope we don‚Äôt have to repeat it here. lol.TLDR: both sides have their points. Up to u which view u wanna adopt.,btohqsg
His adb for the reference month for esaver could be $1,btohqsg
Yup. That was what happened with eSaver.Account was totally emptied since 6th Jun 2024.But gets bonus 3.xx% & base 0.05%?,btohqsg
Will earn  but not the full incremental ADB. Meaning only 9677 and not 100k as stated above.But like what Mt said  ADB/MAB calculations are similar. Divide by 365 lo.,btohqsg
3.25% is 1% visa/master fee and 2.25% bank admin fee though.,btohqsg
0.05% should be from previous month or reference month to be correct,btohqsg
July mab will be compared with June mab.And incremental gets paid 3.xx% Loh.Not entire mab(This is standard promo).If u got exclusive invite promo refer to that tnc. Might have difference reference month.,btohqsg
3.xx Increment compared to that reference,btohqsg
I'm checking some articles when they used youtrip vs bank cc and compared. And result is bank cc is 3% more than youtrip.,btohqsg
Not possible to have this. Which bank?,btohqsg
Why not the full incremental? Previous month is always $0,btohqsg
Really depend on bank and payment gateway,btohqsg
Usually is 3.25% bank fee + 1% fx spread no?,btohqsg
CSPX or SPYL is a better option especially with IBKRReferhttps://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=hEzFHsYsfyrnKUz8,btohqsg
They play with words.It is 3.25% total card charge and 0.8% visa master Amex markup.They just breaking the 3.25%Into 2.25 bank + 1% visa master Amex feeStill have the 0.8% fx markup.,btohqsg
Hi all  for first time credit card application to ocbc and just received first salary (fresh grad)  how to submit documents (pay slip) to ocbc? Ps applied through singsaver,btohqsg
Wah seems like SCB also have this? Then it means they can‚Äôt enforced this 30 days period at all?Brain fried already.,btohqsg
This is not related. Just that keeping 100k for 3 days in Jul is akin to only receiving 100k / 365 days √ó 3 days worth of bonus interest.,btohqsg
best is invitation  no need worry about incremental.,btohqsg
Got 4.6% for invite? ü§ØOh invite don‚Äôt care about incremental?,btohqsg
If only first salary might be tough. You can try to apply and they will likely reject and ask for more documents. Then you upload and send them.Alternatively get secured cc for the time being.,btohqsg
Yea lor I moving it to hsbc ega thanks,btohqsg
No. Best I heard is 3.6% pa. Until 31 August,btohqsg
don't have  i think only 3.55% or 3.6%,btohqsg
4.6 % = 3.55 % fresh + 0.05% prevailing +1% GIRO payment cashback,btohqsg
Very low. T-Bill still higher and at discount.,btohqsg
Got 4% already can laugh ü§£,btohqsg
Not really comparable because one is savings one is 6 months lock in,btohqsg
Using fixed deposit as collateral for your cc. With 80% of the fixed deposit value as credit limit.,btohqsg
I got rejected by OCBC even after I had all the premium cards.Stating I do not meet $30k p.a salary requirement.,btohqsg
That 1% GIRO die die MS out of thin air la.,btohqsg
UOB lo. 1h16mins to laugh. üòπ,btohqsg
Hahaha end up one by one your premium cards kena cut,btohqsg
cham  how come i havent gotten any interest for June,btohqsg
GG. I already transferred out the money liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
That 30 days fresh fund clause has been in eSaver since the beginning.,btohqsg
Eh‚Ä¶ really ah? Then it serves like no purpose at all? I have been doing in & out as frequently as i needed and the interest credited has always been ADB x their advertised interest rate.Confirmed I step on that clause multiple times leh. But nothing happened.,btohqsg
I got less faith in SCB than HSBC. Their app is so bad ü§™,btohqsg
Have you updated your salary with UOB?,btohqsg
Woo this no.3 is big problem. Only July can earn wah lau,btohqsg
May I ask July promotion based on which month abd incremental increase please thanks,btohqsg
I updated with amex. Amex called me that my limit from $180k now is only $12k. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµAnd they said by right I cannot be holding 5 amex credit cards with them including the charge card due to not enough credit limit. ü´†,btohqsg
Well  sometimes banks write things into their T&Cs without the intent nor means to enforce it...,btohqsg
Yeah max is 3 credit + 1 charge,btohqsg
They out to find you already,btohqsg
Are u the one who go and self declare to bank you are retired,btohqsg
I withdrew over first few days of June. Think I better not participate in July,btohqsg
Personally because I withdrawn from HSBC EGA on 1 Jun  I'm gonna keep my funds in SCB eSaver for the 2nd month ü§£,btohqsg
But my wife retired before I married her. And I retired when I married her.,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt need to tell whole world our story,btohqsg

Q2 promo amounts:20K: $80 (now: $100)50K: $250 (now: $300)100K: $550 (now: $700)150K: $1000 (now: $1100),btohqsg
So if I calculate correctly  at the 150K  the additional interest will be:$1100 / 4 months x 12 months / 150K = 2.2%?Plus UOB One normal interest about 4%. Total maybe 6.1%?,btohqsg
I know why they gave more  the earmark period seem longer now. Earmark in aug  release in dec is ard 5 month compare to last quarter of 4 month,btohqsg
150k tierBonus UOB one 4.0% p.a.Nation of savers 1.76% p.a.(1100/150000 * 12/5)Total 5.76% p.a. effective,btohqsg
5 months instead of 4 months now ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
All eir drop coz of the extra 1 month,btohqsg
5.6% pa for 5.5 months lock in.,btohqsg
Secretly drop the eir haha. But 5.6 quite good liao consider interest rate is dropping,btohqsg
And will affect subsequent promos since will take reference from mab of dec (funds still earmarked)?,btohqsg
Previously Uob one is 5% pa on $100k no lock in. Oh well.,btohqsg

Good luck. Pls provide dp. ü§£I‚Äôm doing on 2nd July lol.,btohqsg
What is the difference if doing on 2 July?,btohqsg
U kiasi then do 2nd July (31 days from 1st June),btohqsg

Y'all can try and provide dp. UOB one very specifically put 30 days beforepromotion period(1 Jul). Unlike HSBC.,btohqsg
Then promotion period is 1st July.Put 1st or 2nd no different liao leh.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt risk it. Especially if can be skirted by waiting one day n putting in $155k?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm even more chicken. I‚Äôm using a human that has $1k since May 2024.,btohqsg
Yah I think I do this,btohqsg
1.9 ‚ÄúPromotion Period‚Äù means the period from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024  both dates inclusive.1 July 2024  you put funds into UOB One which day will affect promotion period meh? ü´§,btohqsg
not sure what u asking but refer to 2.9,btohqsg
"1.6(iii). ""30 days before or during the Promotion Period"". Covers D-30.",btohqsg
I‚Äôm looking at eligible fresh funds.,btohqsg
Yes. This is what I‚Äôm looking at.So if promotion period is the period set out fixed by UOB. Then 1st of July willl forever be 1st of July this promo starts.And rewind by 30 days. 1st Jun is the date within 30 days.If you withdraw  means likely UOB can disqualify you liao.,btohqsg
As long as above mab of June 2024. Means fresh funds.But watch out for 1.6.iii which excludes amounts that left Uob from 30 days before promo period. Which technically is 1st June 2024.,btohqsg
"Not really disqualify  but any amounts withdrawn will be counted as ""ineligible"". We still have no dp on this.Would appreciate if someone update from previous promo. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",btohqsg
Yup. Hope UOB don‚Äôt chek ark ah‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hence me chicken:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214243Safer but not 100% assured. Since I mentioned this account also had salary in/out within May 2024. Hence I say the tnc is senseless.,btohqsg
Unless u want to use the highest watermark level of the account + $150 000,btohqsg
Need to find someone who not chicken and put on the dot ü§£,btohqsg
Means UOB can say you withdraw $150k in 1st Jun  now you need $300k in order to have $150k counted as fresh funds‚Ä¶ üò¨ü•πüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  is there any ways to check which category my uob ladies card is on right now?,btohqsg
Flip table. December empty everything wait for 2025 üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes. And watch out for the salary credit in December itself!,btohqsg
Cannot. You're still earmarked until mid December.,btohqsg
I thinking. Still got 23 hours to gamble that $1 100.,btohqsg
This actually causes each player to only take part once every 3 cycles,btohqsg
Oh ya. Theres still this $1600 salary credit thing hor.Damn dumb. Everything cluster together. Last time think EGA complicated  now UOB also like that.,btohqsg
If earmark mean successful liao. No need flip table already. üòÜ,btohqsg
But‚Ä¶. I feel they talk only. Won‚Äôt enforce.But if u can play chicken. Otherwise just try and see if earmark fails or not Loh. U still get 4% pa nevertheless,btohqsg
A question about SCB bonus saver account... My company salary account cut off date is 10th... So i didn't open it in late June as it requires salary credit.,btohqsg
I'm thinking to open the account now to get company prepared for salary credit. Meanwhile  i would like to check if i can deposit fresh fund into bonus saver at the end of July? Or must deposit within some time range to get the signup and save up level up cashback?,btohqsg
A bit turn off by the longer earmark. given the risk of UOB One getting further nerfed while stuck in earmark.,btohqsg
You have 2 calendar months to do so,btohqsg
That is great.I just read through again the tnc for both campaigns.The save up level up should be easy. Putting fund by end of July will consider july as finding month.The signup cashback tnc tells need to deposit 50K 'immediately when opening account'. I am  afraid of this one like how immediately it requires ü§£.,btohqsg
You are given 2 calendar months to clock the salary portion. Minimum deposit must be on the account opening day  maintained for 2 months.Best to do it on 1st of month so you can clock both at the same time.,btohqsg
For UOB new promo  if Jun MAB is 150k  how possible to join the new promo?,btohqsg

Hi All  I suddenly remembered someone said that their giro salary (self initiated) to uob one wasn't counted?There's this danger that once our funds are earmarked and if they stop this loophole  we will be royally screwed for the next 5 months with next to no interest! üò±,btohqsg
hi cardup experts! can anyone explain how the 2.25% cardup fee to pay insurance/taxes/mortgage loan would be worth it/not worth it? i‚Äôm planning to use dbs altitude visa for it but have no idea how cardup truly works in the miles game yet‚Ä¶ thanks! üôèüèª,btohqsg

Hi all  what is usually the best Citi signup offer? Should i wait?,btohqsg
Any citi cards that you are looking at?,btohqsg
anyon knows how to see the quarterly spending time frame of the uob one card ? or where i can find out,btohqsg
from the card statement  if statement not yet generated can ask via uob chat assist,btohqsg
https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculatorcardup has a calculator on their website. You can input the amount and find out fee and earned miles. In my screenshot  you will pay 1.83 cents per mile  which is a lot higher than avg reasonable cost of 1.1-1.3 cpm.,btohqsg
Most common use case is to use cardup to pay income tax pairing with visa card. at 1.75% admin fee  cost per mile is better. Honey Money SG has promo code for it so you can check it out.,btohqsg
Morning Yall! I need some advice as I‚Äôm going to spend around >$2k on Hotels  AirBnb and Air-tickets in Jul24 & Aug24. Planning to get 1 credit card for this. What credit cards do yall recommended?,btohqsg
can check amex cashback card  first 6 months & first 5k spend whichever comes first for unlimited 3% cashback,btohqsg
not unlimited  limit is 5k spend within first 6 months,btohqsg
uh yea for first 5k spend as said above  he need 2k+ only,btohqsg
i see thanks a lot! at least now i know it might not be worth it to use cardup for mortgage loan and insurance payments..,btohqsg
Just to check if any confirmation sms or email upon registration on scb save up level up?It just tells successfully submitted. Not sure if good to start deposit right now,btohqsg
I asked UOB CSO she said deposit today is fine but I think I may still be kiasi and transfer tmr,btohqsg
i think the intention is to avoid people after signup for earmark go and withdraw the money and only put back the money a few days before anticipated earmark...,btohqsg
Good morning all  I know I ask before but still do not really understand the mechanism. I would like to check on HSBC ega. If I open an account today and deposit my money inside and then I withdraw it and put in say uob one account on 31st July  would I get the interest from ega assuming I did the 5 transfers please? Thank you.,btohqsg

Oh now so low no more 4.x%,btohqsg
Yes  only notify the submission. I deposited right after for the previous campaign,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you so much,btohqsg
Has anyone SMS to register for HSBC EGA already? Is the SMS acknowledgement accurate?,btohqsg
I did the UOB Plunging Chicken website registration. All in order.,btohqsg
Ok I know what you mean.. hmm,btohqsg
From UOB one acct transfer to UOB stash acct is it considered fresh fund?,btohqsg
No. Cannot be from existing uob acct.,btohqsg
If transfer out to other bank and transfer in again  then ok  correct?,btohqsg
This time round  UOB also has the 30 days fresh funds clause.I don't think anybody here can 100% tell you how UOB is going to interpret and enforce this clause. So see how safe you wanna play.,btohqsg
I would just say I feel it would be close to impossible (but not impossible) for UOB/HSBC to enforce it 100% since everybody's account will have some form of inflows/outflows within 30 days for example:1. salary credit2. interest payment3. giro fundsThe above applies to both HSBC and UOB (since all having this stupid 30 days clause too),btohqsg
Of course  do a few hoops and variations before transferring the fund back to uob to avoid being too obvious.  Ex: use a different external account to transfer to back to UOB. We wont know how UOB check it  but they can reject it one day as fresh funds and we wont have much grounds to dispute it.,btohqsg
For SP bills using uob one card .. for recurring still get cb right ?,btohqsg
Remember UOB CSO have high rate of being wrong. She might not even know about the 30 days thing.,btohqsg
If you searched  you'll find dp that says yes,btohqsg
I just waiting to see more dp for fall below fee eating into negative. UOB and OCBC have dp already.,btohqsg
Yah I specifically asked about 30 days. Shall be kiasi,btohqsg
For webull deposit promo  is keeping 13.8k sgd till end of July fine? The tnc said usd 10k repeatedly  and somewhere mention currency exchnage rate that. confuses.,btohqsg
Check with Webull CSO on the app  specific T&Cs according to each month,btohqsg
everything is 'caught' under that stupid sentence so i really doubt they can/will enforce it,btohqsg
In the STRICTEST interpretation.. all cashflows RECEIVED in the 30 days before 1st July  needs to be excluded/added.for example uob savings promo  even if your MAB is $1000  but you have salary of $10k in  bonus interest $500 in..and you signed up $150k earmark.. by right you need to maintain:$1000 + $10 000 + $500 + $150 000 throughout the ENTIRE PROMO (which obviously is stupid).,btohqsg
Haiz I only 1 ega account  plus person 2 for merry go round  then giro with my account to earn bonus interest.. Now how liao,btohqsg
"Wondering if UOB do a summation of your funds across all your UOB accounts when considering whether it is fresh fund or the focus is just on One Account.  So if I transferred 100K out of STASH account today say 1 July to another bank  and signed up the promo to earmark 100K for One account and deposit on 31 July. The result is ""zero"" fresh fund and therefore probably don't qualify?",btohqsg
based on past months  they dun,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  are gym membership  Netflix  Telco  SP utilities and Electricity Bills all included under the UOB ONE card Cash Rebate Categories?,btohqsg
DBS WWMC for 4mpd. Calendar month cap of $1.5K  so $3K over 2 months.,btohqsg
Ya sia.Just imagine someone has $150k at start of July  enrol for $150k  then realised they need to spend $100k  now only left $50k  then now they enrol $50k.How? They withdraw during promo period leh. But then should still be eligible for their last register of $50k isn‚Äôt it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I‚Äôm think UOB really don‚Äôt want EXISTING customers to participate anymore.They want NEW customers la. ü§£,btohqsg
can consider usingheymax.aito check on this,btohqsg
I think in a stupid brain thinking.UOB means you have $100k  you withdraw $50k and then put back $50k. It is still $100k instead of $150k.Means you take out and in  will not keep on increasing the fresh fund counter.,btohqsg
hi guys  UOB Paynow Salary from others' own bank account still workable nowadays?,btohqsg
Ya. I think UOB don‚Äôt want people who register for 1st period of promo to take out in 1 August  then 1-2 days before the actual earmark date  put back in again.As customer has satisfied the 31 July funds in account  and have funds for earmark before the actual date  which is 30 August. (They put on 29th August).,btohqsg
Will have dp in a few days... So far no negative dp according to@MelvynEzi.,btohqsg
can FAST also  so long purpose chosen from dropdown list is salary crediting,btohqsg
As long as the amount got earmarked and cash credit received on 30th Aug. You can pull out the rest of your funds leaving the earmarked value alone there till December. Will not be penalized right?,btohqsg
"For the uob 30 days prior clause  it is not difficult to enforce as all uob needs to do is determine outflow of funds. So if you had 150k withdrawn any day in jun (leaving $0)  any funds between 0-150k deposited during promo period (1 jul to 30 sep) will not be considered as incremental fresh funds  REGARDLESS of the source of $$.E.g after taking 150k in 1st june. You put it in HSBC. Now u trf $150k from ur webull acc into uob. Uob likely may intepret as a ""redeposit"" even though ur 150k didnt come from UOB acc originally.Just my own intepretation. Only UOB executives will know the specific fine print",btohqsg
New and old tnc says cannot (whether enforced or not I don‚Äôt know).Must maintain mab + earmark amount throughout entire promo.,btohqsg
Yes you are right if they want to enforce it 100% as written.But whether they can or will. Is another story which nobody knows the answer now.,btohqsg
Yup. Glad to know you also intepret it in the same manner.Just wanted to help those that are planning to make complicated moves to meet the criteria  which they may possibly regret,btohqsg
But T&Cs explicitly stated FAST is excluded.,btohqsg
I'm trying to buy S27 using SRS on POEMS BUT keep getting rejected with an exceed client limit error. Anyone knows who to solve this?,btohqsg
Need to have the same amount deposited in cash as collateral before order,btohqsg
I also think 100% like yours. GG liao.Feel like UOB taking advantage now. Hope they go leniently. üòÅ,btohqsg
Haha that's why we always suspect UOB don't 100% enforce t&c.,btohqsg

Your statement have to be generate before 7 aug,btohqsg
Hmm this is up to UOB isit?,btohqsg
i checked with CS and they say July spend still count under existing T&C,btohqsg
Ur statement date is pretty fix,btohqsg
Phew is your statement period at the end of the month too?,btohqsg
Is there a place to check this? ü´°,btohqsg
U check your statement date history loh aiyo,btohqsg
The truth is out!At HSBC branch now.Your fresh funds has to be 30 days apart.So last month you transfer out 3 Jun This month you better only fresh fund in on 4th July.This is from our RM. Conincidentlaly met him at branch. üòÇ,btohqsg
So HSBC spent money on these petty checks,btohqsg
Unless your card is approved on 7 Jun onwards  where it takes effect immediately,btohqsg

Hi did anyone receive this coupon enhancement from Moomoo? Wonder how it works,btohqsg
Did he answer you confidently and immediately without doing any checks?If so  it's not a good sign that the staff are prepared and understand the new mechanics very wellIt means the bank may be serious about the new terms ü§£,btohqsg

how to find MAB for Jun?,btohqsg
Yes. He said it‚Äôs always been in place  just want to be more explicit now.,btohqsg
Yes lol -$5 service fee. Already asked for waiver.,btohqsg
You tell me if can. Cuz I also want to ask ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Wait a few days it will appear on your app ü§£Or call UOB to ask.,btohqsg
Need to wait and see. Subject to approval.,btohqsg
"Well  this signifies something else againWe been receiving bonus interests   without adhering to the 30 days ruleIf its ""always in place"" it means it's not enforced",btohqsg
Okay. UOB staff not confident  I asked if I withdraw on 1 Jun $150k  now 1st July I put in or 2nd July out in.Staff cannot confirm  said need 2-3 days to check with relevant department and get back to me.But staff also said the 1st July - 31 Sept (Promotion period) remains no matter which date I deposit my funds.Because 1 Jun also covered under the clause of 30 days before 1st July (Promotion period).WLWLWLBBQL,btohqsg
Yeah. But habc it‚Äôs hard to check.It‚Äôs not as simple as 30 days  but also MAB/DAB also considered in calculation. üßÆ,btohqsg

Why not transfer in $155k on 02 July to solve this problem if you withdrew on 01 June.,btohqsg

hi all  have anyone appeal for the fall below bal fee for uob before? has anyone succeed? thanks,btohqsg
Hi Mt Would like to seek clarification based on your understanding on the promo.In my case  I only have Human A to work with.I left min balance in my HSBC EGA account for month of June.I just registered for July's promo. I understand the registration is valid for months of July and AugustFor month of August - the bonus interest will be based on June as reference month for AB  yes?,btohqsg
June has $2000. Registered on 1st July for EGA promo.You will earn 3.x% interest onJuly and August incremental balances on top of $2000Also  you will earn 1% interest onJuly incremental balances on top of $2000August incremental balances on top of July's ADB.,btohqsg
Thanks very much for your definitive response. Really very appreciated,btohqsg
1st of Jun is still within 30 days of the promo period.30 days before and including whole period of promotion period from 1 July to 31 Sept. you cannot touch. Which is ridiculous.But yeah  I‚Äôm just gonna do tomorrow. ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Dear Members  wanted to ask what‚Äôs the best card for daily usage to earn miles ( example transport  restaurant  online purchases),btohqsg
Ya. By definition of the new T&C.Funds going out & in again  no matter the origin or destination UOB account.It will not be ‚Äúfresh fund‚Äù.You also will be calculated based on incremental MAB in the event you pass that 30 days criteria.Which is conflicting and ridiculous.So many facepalm moments at UOB.HSBC was very very straightforward on other hand.,btohqsg
Hi all  like to check with you guys.If you're going overseas and gonna purchase a large ticket item(eg watch)Which will be the best card to use?,btohqsg

Hi  can l check if l deposited $1800 via paynow under 'Sal' to the ocbc 360 account and no withdrawal for the whole mth  will that count as increase average daily balance of at least $500 ?,btohqsg
At the beginning of the month? If so yes.,btohqsg
When will the funds be earmarked usually? My first time participating... I have several intra day transfer in and out  but end of day balance is always at $1k. Hopefully can help to contribute positive dp!,btohqsg
Minimally the 1800 have to be in the account for 9 days. And Salary credit has to be from another name.,btohqsg
You can check the table on t&c.,btohqsg
Table only show when will it be released. But when will it be locked? That's not stated right?,btohqsg
No more +S$160 vouchee. Pls take note,btohqsg
The earmarked date is stated in the table,btohqsg
I thought 30 Aug refers to the date when they will credit the cash credit and funds will be earmarked in a few days time?! You mean we need to wait till 30 Aug earliest to know if our funds have been successfully earmarked?! üò±,btohqsg
Can I participate by moving my funds from my stash account to my one account?,btohqsg
Yes and if you break the criteria before end date  they will claw back rewards,btohqsg
So if we missed to start today means we waste an entire month?,btohqsg
by 30 Aug. Usually earmark earlier around 20+ of the month.,btohqsg
no  have till 31Jul to register and have sufficient funds,btohqsg
Can I participate with transferring my funds from stash account to one account?,btohqsg
Fresh funds cannot come from existing uob account,btohqsg
Ok. So I need to move out the money first then sign up  then move it back in?,btohqsg
And How badly will it affect my one account interest if I move money out and back? Is one day enough?,btohqsg
Please read the tncs carefully if you want to take part. I would say you are probably too late to participate for this round.,btohqsg
Hi all  I got one question.For priority pass  can I borrow my relatives to access the lounge without my presence?,btohqsg
Oh. So it‚Äôs 30 days. I thought I read people were going to empty the account right before July in anticipation of an earmark promo in July (I forgot about it!). So this means it doesn‚Äôt work that way  we can‚Äôt move out the money just for a couple days and move back in to take part  am I getting it?,btohqsg
