this dude driving all over singapore lately. Saw him twice on CTE in 2 days. Second time there was a GTR chasing him,btohqsg
the other time at the groc meet when the r35s were driving on the road there were ‚Äúpops and bangs‚Äù,btohqsg
you cant really expect anyone to rev louder cars singapore either,btohqsg
Fr I don't think you can even rev your lambo or later TP come invite you to drink kopi tgt,btohqsg
u obsessed w pops n bangs or wat,btohqsg
dempsey morning meets are meant for enjoying breakfast and meeting familiar faces.. not pops and bangs.. you want those go elsewhere. either way it's highly discouraged and i can safely tell you this p&b thing has fallen out of trend much long agothe only reasonable cars to have such features are basically track/rally cars (of which both are not legal) to keep boost.. i have not seen any car with pop and bang at a meet actually have it serve a proper purpose towards the driving of the car (other than just noise and annoyance),btohqsg
but full loan cs3 and rocco with pops and bangs attracts xmm!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
as mentioned here.. already threading on very very thin ice (even thinner with recent incidents),btohqsg
go zouk see which xmm want you,btohqsg
one with a body count as high as the rocco's transfer count üòÇ,btohqsg
ya no pop and bang ah,btohqsg
happy new year to all my chinese frn,btohqsg
understand ah but not everytime can have bah,btohqsg
I think i misunderstood what i asked.I asked where can i find cars with pops and bangs.Someone else mentioned dempsey hill which im uninterested in‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Understand dempsey hill should not have pops and bangs..,btohqsg
any car can pop and bang,btohqsg
I use my phone add pop pop one,btohqsg
Nice car  nice carplate shitty driver,btohqsg
He cut and cause people to jam brake for no reason sia,btohqsg
‚ÄúDrive it like you stole it‚Äùüëë,btohqsg
