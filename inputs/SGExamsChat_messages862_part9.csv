Sounds like time dilation effect ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I think by then my brain dilated also hahaha,btohqsg
But yea jc was a fun period for me,btohqsg
I want to ask if jc cca same as secondary school,btohqsg
Or are there others not found in secondary school,btohqsg
Mmm we have a jamband club uh,btohqsg
But majority of the ccas can be found in sec schools,btohqsg
Poly or university we have strange cca not found in secondary schools,btohqsg
The only diff i can pinpoint is they consider student council or leadership ccas as a cca,btohqsg
They dont rlly have uniform grp ccas in JC often  though for atas jc-sec schools ones  they do,btohqsg
Is mostly btw sports  arts or clubs,btohqsg
Needs field when football is more common,btohqsg
I nvr thought abt why but i wld normally assume by jc  it wld be quite unpopular  esp cus guys dont want to do early ns before enlisting to ns,btohqsg
no wonder everytime ndp ceremony the flat bearers are a bunch of random ppl,btohqsg
Yea I rather be in a container during ndp,btohqsg
I associate ndp and national day as 2 seperate things hahaha,btohqsg
iâ€™m pretty sure there are guys who think npcc ncc is gonna help them get a head start for ns ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Oh yea in jc you get to do ippt early too :D,btohqsg
yeah next february for me ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Only some poly has it ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
this one dh the monetary awards for ippt gold etc right,btohqsg
I'm pes e. I dont know this hahahahaha,btohqsg
Only thing i know is if you do well for ippt  you can reduce your ns to 1 yr 10 mnths (assumed combat fit uh),btohqsg
ya i think i read somewhere that ippt gold have like $700,btohqsg
Having covid pandemic during ns was peaceful.,btohqsg
Like train at home rather than at camp uh,btohqsg
They gave up after 1 mnth for us during lockdown,btohqsg
"They were like ""ok we dunno what to give u guys so yall wait until lockdown finishes""",btohqsg
Actually I want to ask about ns matters too,btohqsg
What constitute unfit for ns ?,btohqsg
Cus pes c and pes e are considered non combat fit,btohqsg
ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… like physical impairment I know,btohqsg
oh ya issit need luck to get assigned to spf,btohqsg
I believe this one is by luck,btohqsg
the class 3 license quite appealing,btohqsg
But what about mental impairment ?,btohqsg
But for pes  they base on this thing called PULHEEMS,btohqsg
"Each letter associating each like ""section""",btohqsg
So like U is upper body,btohqsg
E is left eye or right eye,btohqsg
The one you are refering to is M,btohqsg
They will put level 1 to level 9,btohqsg
Coz mental impairment very subjective uh,btohqsg
So a pes A person could have all level 1s,btohqsg
But once one of the categories is like at a sibei high level  that's it,btohqsg
So in a way  a person with minor scoliosis and minor depression is still at a higher level than someone who is entirely fit but autistic,btohqsg
Like what ppl consider as impairment in legal system may not be considered in ns military system,btohqsg
That's why if you notice right,btohqsg
And I heard gt ppl fake mental illness to get out toob,btohqsg
ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… but I can't prove it reliably so speculation,btohqsg
