why do u do the things u do,btohqsg
any input on why i would go crazy?,btohqsg
lmao it was the darkest time of my life amath during amath p2 ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Last year was fun. I'm gonna miss it,btohqsg
wasn't it just being held at home,btohqsg
because the subreddit is crazy99% ranting/whining posts,btohqsg
or at least those posts get upvoted the most,btohqsg
You know thrs something wrong when theres no jokes abt the papers contents,btohqsg
about the rants as someone who is going to take them,btohqsg
oh dont bother about those sad postsjust focus on yourself,btohqsg
i haven't looked at them so yea,btohqsg
I don't think u shd be too concerned since most of them are the really outliers. In any case  moderation will save u most of the time,btohqsg
Okay lah  i wont say jts that bad... But compared to almost all prelim papers  never seen one like that,btohqsg
i thought moderation would save me,btohqsg
nothing could have saved meother than myself ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
I remember when everyone here thot u needed 90+ to get A1 for emaths,btohqsg
You problably do need close... To 90,btohqsg
my friend thst lost abt 10 marks A2,btohqsg
Mm to be frank i feel a2...,btohqsg
But amaths the score for A1 was quite low imo,btohqsg
u see  as someone who is either ignorant or clueless (feel free to pick one)  i didn't know cut off grades are diff,btohqsg
Last yrs cohort i think emath was insane lol lose 5 marks and A2. But my friend didnt account working  presentation fault. So maybe minus from that as well.,btohqsg
bruh whati definitely lost way more than 5 marksgot A2 as well,btohqsg
I think i lost 5 marks I got A1 thou,btohqsg
what in the o level marking is this,btohqsg
Still ok. Working nvr account for  so...,btohqsg
Do u feel people did worse or better than expected?,btohqsg
thats why i  say dont care so much about the detailsmake you go mad,btohqsg
Yea just do the test and forget about it,btohqsg
Amath def worse than expected LOL,btohqsg
i can't rly say much since my seniors were a mess  and when i say  mess  â€” they did not know shit,btohqsg
I mean the result not the paper,btohqsg
Like after taking the paper and then seeing their results,btohqsg
Result... Eh i kinda expecred my result  so...,btohqsg
hm thanks for the warning but i kinda got myself in deep shit already,btohqsg
Still remember my friend was upset over raw 8 haha,btohqsg
At the end  i say english is what kills most people LOL. Experienced it first hand,btohqsg
Lmao first thing i saw eng b4,btohqsg
Blame it on the jackass penguins lol,btohqsg
uh on a completely diff topic  but  how can i secure a place in a poly if i'm going to study abroad for a year? (forced to),btohqsg
this is why i dont like the subredditthe people in the subreddit do too wellso many <10 l1r5i want to cry,btohqsg
what do you mean by study abroad though,btohqsg
no like  would they wait for the student to come back?,btohqsg
EAE is good if you want to chope a spot and bypass JAE,btohqsg
i'm supposedly going to a religious sch abroad for a year to ingrain somefoundationknowledge bt it's whatever,btohqsg
i think you gotta apply separately from JAE but im not too sure,btohqsg
which country? if you dont mind sharing,btohqsg
Ah Os is kinda scary haha. One bad mistake and ur score that reflects ur entire 4 years is screwed,btohqsg
emm i think u can apply for jae aft u come back?,btohqsg
