I got send the pic in this chat b4,btohqsg
idk but i'm assuming she's done with all the newtonian mechanics stuff,btohqsg
i mean schools don't always follow that order,btohqsg
Idk man last year we learn to some chap then skip and jump to other chap,btohqsg
Back then not alot of ppl from mi went uni,btohqsg
I quote them apparently the staff here  say not quite like b4 liao,btohqsg
measurements  kinematics  dynamics  wep  circular motion,btohqsg
I mean the Cher here said it's rlly self directed learning  if uw do well can't solely rely on the sch system or wtv,btohqsg
Idk how is mi is actly diff from JC but I thought both mi and JC are pre u,btohqsg
do a quick rinse and change,btohqsg
i kinda disagree with that sentiment,btohqsg
ok but my stance is more for uni,btohqsg
i mean you also dk what extent that one is,btohqsg
sounds like you're projecting a bit,btohqsg
from my experience some people that do this only do it bc they not sure,btohqsg
a lot of poly and uni aren't as familiar with the material as you'd want them to be,btohqsg
or it's way too trivial to them that they can't relate to the student's struggle,btohqsg
from uni onwards i just take the prof's lectures and notes as one resource then study myself with other things i find,btohqsg
idk about poly but uni need to submit proposal and all that,btohqsg
teaching prepped content takes diff skills from answering questions,btohqsg
I mean it's a pre u,btohqsg
uni for me is better but idk ntu physics profs are generally p good from what i've experienced,btohqsg
Like here in MI the teachers q good leh they even actually chase u for hw uk,btohqsg
but i've also only consulted prof for clarification once before,btohqsg
and that's during my final undergrad year,btohqsg
Like I feel bad for the Chers cause alot of students dl hand up hw,btohqsg
Altho u barely pay for sch fres,btohqsg
It's kinda stupid to not make full use of them,btohqsg
Like for me right   if you'd only just ask  the Cher confirm try to help one way or another,btohqsg
I'll really rip out Ur Einstein hair irl,btohqsg
I hope u end up balding,btohqsg
learning to find ways to study and learn even if the lecturer is bad is a v important skill,btohqsg
esp in uni where every prof has their own funny way of doing things,btohqsg
like word for word i asked one of my profs before,btohqsg
then he explained how uni isn't just teaching you content,btohqsg
the prof isn't going to give you every bit of info you need,btohqsg
Like when I was retaking  I also figured out my way of learning,btohqsg
Which I unfortunately didnt manage to during Os,btohqsg
(but if they suck at answering questions that's another thing),btohqsg
u have a pt lah  everybody's oughta be responsible for their own learning outcomes,btohqsg
Not blame the lecturer esp if he can't teach,btohqsg
It takes two hands to clap,btohqsg
poly onwards you're paying mainly for the qualification,btohqsg
but i think adapting to the way things work kinda evolves into how you'll have to handle things when working,btohqsg
Those who ask him qns typically learn beforehand alr,btohqsg
I rlly like my new Econs teacher tho,btohqsg
you want qualified people to teach but self directed learning is fr really important,btohqsg
ig aside from the qualification itself,btohqsg
self learning skills outside of an institute setting has long shown to be not that effective,btohqsg
Because he's so long winded   some of the stuff he mention is alr him teaching the content,btohqsg
