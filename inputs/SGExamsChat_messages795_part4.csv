It wouldn't be creepy if it was adults?,btohqsg
more of perception on what's an acceptable age difference changes as one gets older,btohqsg
but idk how the person approached you so can't comment on that la,btohqsg
"Honestly  I kena this before when I was in JC. Some random old ass guy arnd his 35s to 40s being like ""Do you know the elephant story""  ""Do you knoe the chicken rice story"".",btohqsg
Like stfu man I wan meet my sec sch friend ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
He just stopped me from behind and basically said I was cute then ask for telegram. I told him my age and we chatted for a bit. It was very random  he was telling me ab his job n stuff,btohqsg
Weird part is i recall it at an mrt station,btohqsg
Waiting for Si Yan to approach me,btohqsg
"i waiting for bus one time in sec school  this middle age women clad in like some sparkly outfit ask me ""where is this location""..i look up the location  its pinpoint is inside a garbage collection building",btohqsg
oh yea not talking about building like sembcorp headquarters ah,btohqsg
im talking about buildings like this,btohqsg
Oh that is for garbage collecting?,btohqsg
idk what tf she tryna do in these places,btohqsg
anyways i look at the map and just directed her onto a bus,btohqsg
*suddenly rmb one 2010s Channel 8 drama about a woman going to these places to find a handphone  it was the finale episode*,btohqsg
i got a sneaky feeling she taking a illicit package,btohqsg
Possibly finding scraps but other than that,btohqsg
yea ok then it's creepy. that age diff with how young you are and no context,btohqsg
The classic.Did you forget to eat your medicine?,btohqsg
nah it was that specific garbage collection building,btohqsg
but it was a pinpoint/waymarker to a very direct one,btohqsg
and it was nowhere near where we were,btohqsg
i was in ubi  the waymarker was in the vacinity of sengkang,btohqsg
That is very far off hahahaha,btohqsg
NAH..thats why i directed her onto a bus that basically stops at main road,btohqsg
Kinda glad that was the end of it,btohqsg
no shit any further you will be on the verge of certain assault or stalking,btohqsg
I'm not local so hopefully not,btohqsg
The whole time I was thinking u have such established job why can't find gf,btohqsg
i am going to say tho  its increasing prevalent of young people asking for numbers of strangers or socials in public,btohqsg
i mean individual things about the incident are ok just that when put them together it raises alarm bells,btohqsg
the sales people acosting people outside shops skills are coming out at full display,btohqsg
Yeah I even saw there was a community on tiktok to practice hitting on girls,btohqsg
yea no..thats just complete rage bait kind of post fr,btohqsg
nothing wrong with shooting his shot but if he dk you at all AND he's that much older then it'll obv creep people out,btohqsg
plus how he went on about his job screams bad vibes,btohqsg
"there is actually a well interesting technique from one of those ""how to date"" vids lmao i actually find it reasonably works cause you wont cause any girls any probs...basically just start a convo and end the convo by you giving your phone number or socials and walking away lolz",btohqsg
so if the other party indeed is interested..they will pursue..if not no harm no foul just forget the socials/phone number,btohqsg
Shit gotta sleep tmr gotta intern. Eh u doing internship rn also rite,btohqsg
The job thing was just part of the conversation though  not that he bragged about it or sth. But personally it didn't feel creepy at the moment  just when u think the situation all over again afterwards,btohqsg
that job portion was prob just so that he could talk to you about something,btohqsg
idk maybe he was just shooting his shot then  just that the age makes it extra off putting,btohqsg
I don't understand why people don't do this more instead of asking for their contact,btohqsg
because rejection is hard pill to swallow,btohqsg
i don't see an issue with asking for contact either in general,btohqsg
Sometimes when u ask instead of give ur contact we feel kinda obliged like what if he doesn't take rejection nicely  what if he stalks  etc,btohqsg
this how mis com happens...the girl is alr put in a place,btohqsg
thats the prob with asking for contacts or socials,btohqsg
the issue isn't about oh why can't one side do this,btohqsg
it's just one side expects a certain form of communication from the other,btohqsg
