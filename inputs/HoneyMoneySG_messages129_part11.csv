@TrazoraThanks!! Can coz I check from Heymax.. The UOB One card was at the bottom of the list.,btohqsg
What are the some cash back cards suitable for cardup  beside Maybank Platinum cc?,btohqsg
That's probably the only one. Other cashback card ain't attractive to use with cardup.,btohqsg
Bonus interest is only credited 7th business day.1 Sep is a Sunday.,btohqsg
Nil. Next best and only card available is BOC Family Card.,btohqsg
Good morning  may I know what's the merchant category code (MCC) advance certificate in learning and performance 2.0 (ACLP 2.0) offered by Institute of Adult Learning (IAL)?Wonder what is the optimal credit card to use for this? Thank youüòâ,btohqsg
I use the wallet. haha  because recently I shopped quite alot on pdd  and every single transaction  alipay would prompt me with opt. So i guess physcal scanning the qr would be the same. I find it mafan üòÖ  wallet has got no spread  then 3% never mindüòÇ i go for connivence on this matter.,btohqsg
hi! I'm trying to reconcile my yuu points using dbs yuu card. if I spent at toast box  I should get 5% cash rebate + 13% bonus. so if a drink costs $2.20  how many yuu Pts should I get ?,btohqsg
PSA: whoever using trust cashback card. Note that kfc themselves not familiar there is a $5 off $40 promo. Keep insisting only $2 off $20 (lousier). Please keep this screenshot to show them. Lehma I overseas also have to dig out send to household to settle this!,btohqsg
scan yuu qr 1x pointstoast box 9x pointsbonus 26x points2.2√ó36 = 79 yuu points,btohqsg
this simplifies the calculations. thank u !,btohqsg
Why you want to use UOB Onc cc for cardup? To let Cardup make more money ?,btohqsg
For UOB krisflyer card  is there any mthly or yearly cap to earning 3mpd when buying SQ tickets? Do i earn 3mpd if i buy from Expedia (referral link from Shopback) or die die must buy from SQ official website? Tqtq all.,btohqsg
Referral link should be fine. Expedia is eligible for delayed 1.8mpd so you are ok if you spend 800 on SIA group.,btohqsg
Uob one cc not eligible for cardup right? Dunno why heymax put it as one of the recommended card to use.,btohqsg
heymax recommends based on mcc. they do not reflect the exclusions as stated in t&cs,btohqsg
if not  u really think ocbc and uob will give u 8% cashback on cardup?,btohqsg
Heymax is least reliable. T&c always most reliable.,btohqsg
Hmmm I won‚Äôt be so sure.My (hotel + Ana air tickets) on Expedia got posted as Expedia and Ana 2 separate credit card transactions.No issue if buying sq tickets in fact better if split into Expedia and Singapore airlines.Problem is if non sq tickets.,btohqsg
That is why we have RonGPT  MtGPT over here.,btohqsg
Oh the Expedia quirk with airline,btohqsg
But it doesn't happen with all the airlines right?,btohqsg
Honestly I don‚Äôt know how it works,btohqsg
I bought Thai airways flights on Expedia and transaction showed Expedia correctly.,btohqsg
I have a question regarding the Esaver account and I hope someone can help :I opened the account June 4th to make use of promotion ( July-August). In July I put some money and emptied account in August to HSBSC EGA.Now for September I plan to move money back to Sc Esaver ( to use promo Aug / September St least for the remaining 27 days of Sep)  Do they compare the balance to my July account then ? If I deposit 140 K  will they only give interest for the difference? I attach my statement of July here :,btohqsg
July deposited only 5070 SGD but had a leftover from June  will I only earn interest of 3.30% of (140 K-5.070 K) or (140K-113K) ?,btohqsg
Sep monthly average balance-Jul monthly average balance,btohqsg

"May I check if anyone applied 2nd supplementary card for UOB ONE credit card? It says ""No annual fee on the first card"". How about 2nd ? Is it easy to ask to waive? Thanks.",btohqsg
I think you need to spend a certain amount.Can someone verify the amount. Is it 6k-10kpa?,btohqsg
I spent at least 500per month and it is easy to waive the annual fee for principle card. Not sure the requirements on 2nd supplementary card. Anyone has any idea? Thanks.,btohqsg
For the supplementary card(s)  just ask for waiver. Ask and u shall be given üôè,btohqsg
Any other cards? Like youtrip or revolut?,btohqsg
Trust cashback card. No fcy and 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Do you mean you get your moomoo 6.8% interest 1 day after it matured? Mine is already third day after it matured  still no news. üò°,btohqsg
Collected but the cash takes 3 working days to credit to the account,btohqsg
Should probably poke customer service via whatsapp,btohqsg
Ok. I saw it now credited as a coupon today. Thanks for the info. üëç,btohqsg
Hi gurus  may I ask how does payment to recurring insurance premiums work for uob one CC? The MCC appears in the credit card tnc as exclusion. But yet its in the eligible section of uobone acct.üòµ‚Äçüí´Is it mainly just to clock the UOB One savings account's spending?,btohqsg
Did you receive the moomoo 2% coupon for 15 days promo? Any idea how it works?,btohqsg
Are u on July-August or August-September promo.,btohqsg
Initially signed for July-Aug   I thought to use it for Sep toi given that August I use it HSBC,btohqsg
