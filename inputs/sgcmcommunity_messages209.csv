My dealer friend says very busy now. Lots of moving used car sales. Don’t know new cars also moving well. Let’s see.,btohqsg
ah chee will scoop all the monies. hit his performance target and going for future PM gong,btohqsg
But if used car prices move fast cus price go down also good,btohqsg
If used car move fast  I think new car sales also good. They are linked like chain,btohqsg
People afford buy new car and cannot afford much buy used car,btohqsg
Last time is coe high used car fast,btohqsg
Now is coe high or low,btohqsg
Used car sales faster also mean new car sales faster right? No matter coe high or lowThere is a demand,btohqsg

Can they import a new Kia picanto 2020?,btohqsg
No P Plate applies to alll ur license,btohqsg
Eh if u got 3 and 4,btohqsg
P plate display for that class but points drop to 12,btohqsg
So if u exceed > 12 pts for class 3,btohqsg
I mean  if you get endorsed for passing tp test on that class. Will the p-plate be for that class only?,btohqsg
Its to ALL license that u have explained,btohqsg
Class 2 P plate 12 pointsClass 3 Non P Plate 12 pointsClass 4 Non P plate 12 points,btohqsg
As long as u got 1 P plate  it affects ALL ur licenses.,btohqsg
So good luck to u if u exceed 12 points on class 3 thinking it wont affect ur class 2,btohqsg
Imagine they separate it out  means 1 year this person got 24 points x 2 + 12 points,btohqsg
No it doesnt work like that,btohqsg
Obviously lol. There is a reason why you put all the eligible vehicle class on 1 license,btohqsg

Hi  anyone with vezel or hr-v with this problem? Car cannot start and Battery is new and healthy. AAA came and check  battery ok. AAA did something   then he turn the steering wheel clockwise and anti clockwise. Then the car can start but the symbols still have  after drive for a while the symbols all disappeared. Was told to go “reset” at workshop. Reset what sia?,btohqsg
Vezel/HRV is famous for Christmas lights,btohqsg
Must go workshop to reset error codes?,btohqsg
If U have the thing lor,btohqsg
Steering Lock Issue: Many cars  including the Honda Vezel and HR-V  have an electronic steering lock system. If the system malfunctions or detects an error (e.g.  improper key signal)  the car won't start. Turning the steering wheel clockwise and anti-clockwise might have disengaged the lock  allowing the car to start again.,btohqsg
Ahhh I see thank you for your reply!,btohqsg
I have another question about Honda vezel/hr-v. sometimes when I don’t turn on the automatic engine idle button  when the car is idling  suddenly when I want to drive off  the car stops  and I have to restart the car. So I have been turning on the button to turn off the automatic engine idle function. Any idea what why the car fully stop during and won’t restart during automatic engine idle is happening?,btohqsg
Why don’t you bring to workshop for a proper check by the professional?,btohqsg
Check already  they said nothing wrong. Just wondering if anyone encounter similar issues  thank you,btohqsg
The idle-stop function relies on the starter motor to quickly restart the engine. A worn-out or dirty starter motor might fail to operate properly  resulting in the car stalling when u try to drive off.,btohqsg
Ahh I see  I will check this when I go workshop thank you!,btohqsg
Why you using my father picture,btohqsg
I like the NTUC link points,btohqsg
Sibeh annoying these bunch of scammers,btohqsg
How’s the Suzuki Swift (both 3rd and 4th gen). What are the common issues among them?,btohqsg
Cuz i’n also soon will drive a Honda Vezel/HRV my dad would buy,btohqsg
Need to look out for common issues,btohqsg
RU/RV is famous for Christmas light,btohqsg
Good2.. RV one rear passenger space like cramped,btohqsg
RU common issue is PHV unit with tuned mil,btohqsg
I find RV more spacious than RU,btohqsg
Rear if like me 1.68m tall  need slouch to sit..,btohqsg
I already sat on both versions,btohqsg
Come out always bang head against doorframe..,btohqsg
Don’t like the third gen because of the narrow field of vision,btohqsg
I think if my family had kept the RV Vezel  might need to consider wearing helmet..,btohqsg
I 176 no prob getting in out,btohqsg
I also do consider getting the Yaris’s Cross but there are also things I don’t like about it,btohqsg
50-50 or long leg  short torso?,btohqsg
The signal lights are super irritating  sounds like a child’s toy,btohqsg
Cus I short leg  big torso  so bang head against door frame 😅,btohqsg
Anyways  if I would buy a car. Definitely a simple car like a Swift,btohqsg
Since those are the only 2 generations available,btohqsg
This newest generation. Many say it looks uglier than the outgoing model,btohqsg
I think the A2L is slightly nicer,btohqsg
If you consider  got alvin if got things to ask,btohqsg
Handling of that car is nice too. I already driven several cars at this point liao,btohqsg
I tried his car one time  pretty shiok I feel,btohqsg
Ahhh  then probably easier for you to get out of the rear passenger cabin,btohqsg
Very rare sight. RHD C3 corvette,btohqsg
Who goes on a report war ah?,btohqsg
hello  i'm looking at 2nd hand around 5 years old  12k to 14k dep  specifically at civic  cerato  altis  avante. In terms of FC  how do you rank them? thanks.,btohqsg
Toyota Corolla AltisHonda CivicHyundai AvanteKia Cerato,btohqsg
Just rank ur feet. Your FC is proportionate to your right feet. Considering all is 1.6NA  u shud see their laden weight also. Avante and Cerato same engine(correct me if im wrong) so is the same. Internal features would be similar depending on spec. Drove both before. Pleasant to drive.,btohqsg
Sergeant Bed calling me to sleep,btohqsg
Get Avante CN7 instead  not Avante (Elantra AD facelift). FC should be the best for non hybrid 1.6NA.,btohqsg
Sexy car but the N version not in SG,btohqsg
Pui. Need 2.0 4 cylinder 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Hear the exhaust go POP POP POP,btohqsg
U want what sound also have,btohqsg
Speaker won’t even give that kind of sound la,btohqsg
A lot of things U dunno yet,btohqsg
Want to make cherry QQ sound like Aventador also can,btohqsg
Can Kia bring the new picanto 1.2a 2021?,btohqsg
What’s everyone thoughts about Kia? And comparing with Hyundai. Tia.,btohqsg
hyundai more premium feel to it... but everything else almost identical,btohqsg
just choose whichever looks nicer to you... or go test drive and pick whichever drivers nicer,btohqsg
Some say Kia unreliable. Thats what I heard. But I feel in general both brands give better interior and more luxury like venti seats etc if compared with Toyota.,btohqsg
Also with platform-sharing between Kia and Hyundai  quality and ride would've improved a lot after all these years. Like the Ioniq 5 and EV6  and Palisade and Telluride (which we don't get).,btohqsg
Maybe this is possible since Hyundai had already established the luxury brand  Genesis  in North America  allowing them to pass down some luxurious quality to their more affordable counterparts? Maybe?,btohqsg
Both r good budget grocery cars,btohqsg
No 1 pick altis: (good head room  very big boot space can put 2 golf bag in no issue  reliable in FC  low maintenance),btohqsg
Avante CN7 does all this but better,btohqsg
Hyundai and Kia has improved lots as compared to a decade ago.,btohqsg
Wah i really love the cn7,btohqsg
Me too  really value for money and yet a drivers car,btohqsg
Steering input is accurate  sequential gear also responsive. Only downside is 1.6L but it suits the car well,btohqsg
I feel like it’s already enough for your average singaporean,btohqsg
Same engines same drivetrain. Kia focuses on more sporty looks  hyundai is more on comfort,btohqsg
Changing bmw x5 3.0t to Porsche Macan 2.0t pdk is upgrade or downgrade? Same year.,btohqsg
Both just a normal grocery getter,btohqsg
Bro actually tbh right civic is rubbish,btohqsg
I think you’re the only one who thinks that 😅,btohqsg
I see RR go market also,btohqsg
ur logic got error. I suspect ur math not good also. Car go mkt does not mean it only can be a mkt car.,btohqsg
Who said anything about thinking 🤔,btohqsg
See which one pleases ur eye,btohqsg
Drove both before. Feels the same. 🤣🤣interior wise is the only difference,btohqsg
Both is good so is really up to u which one u prefer more,btohqsg
But hor given their price point,btohqsg
Ur arf is only 10k upon scrap,btohqsg
Oh no now cerato no more? Dont see it on sgcm listing,btohqsg
hope its a nice facelift or smth,btohqsg
New K4 coming to replace cerato,btohqsg
The front end looks pretty nice though,btohqsg
Ask them to bring K8 leh,btohqsg
But the rear end.. is a bit.. depends on the person I feel.,btohqsg
Looks good to me  same taillights as carnival hybrid,btohqsg
But definitely some people won't like,btohqsg
Lower half  I don't mind but the upper half looking like a fastback not really,btohqsg
Is this based on the Avante CN7 platform?,btohqsg
Online says it is diff platform  CL4,btohqsg
No turbo leh .. if have I will be good,btohqsg
ask sg get rid of coe,btohqsg
implement ERP 2.0 then remove COE,btohqsg
Remove COE .. is Sipeh idea bro,btohqsg
if not how lta add in 20k coe,btohqsg
Don’t worry Abang ..  he want be come Ho Chi Minh City 🤣,btohqsg
But w erp 2.0 and coe  it shud regulate,btohqsg
COE shld flat rate.Cat A 100kCat B 150kOpen $175Then ballot system,btohqsg
To secure a ballot  min 50% down,btohqsg
Then extend frm 10yrs to 15yrs and no renewal,btohqsg
If sell before 10yrs pay penalty. Then next car COE pay additional 10%,btohqsg
Must secure COE before going showroom,btohqsg
Wa bro with this price. Election gg alr,btohqsg
See all this scammers see until sian,btohqsg
Hi All  I see that Audi A3 is also around 14k depre. What do you all think of it? Higher fc and maintenance?,btohqsg
No point comparing FCs in normal petrol car. 10km/l vs 12km/l the difference is minimal. Unless you are vs hybrid.Conti always have much better drive feel vs jdm or kdm at the same level. They also have a more premium outlook and interior vs jdm2 main downsides:A3 will be squeezy if you need to fit a 5th passenger in the 2nd row.Maintenance cost will be slightly higher at 1-2k more per year.,btohqsg
For the 2nd row  A3 is the smallest among the few?,btohqsg
I test drive civic and A3  went for the civic T,btohqsg
A3 is just basic of the basics,btohqsg
Cant even compare to entry A Class Sedan and 2 Series,btohqsg
Even a Avante CN7 beats the A3,btohqsg
Audi A3 just riding on the ‘premium’ brand,btohqsg
Can't imagine there are locals conspiring with foreigners to scam locals,btohqsg
but civic is cvt. cvt is shit😂,btohqsg
116 A3 A160 all in the same cat,btohqsg
Comfort = A160. Drive = 116. A3 is mixed of both,btohqsg
116 is fwd platform wont get any better drive,btohqsg
if really need to choose between the BBA,btohqsg
Anyway just go test drive all and have a feel ba,btohqsg
If its old car. Jdm also plenty to repair. Suspension alone for jdm already 1k+ liao. So don think toyota or honda are worry free. Wear n tear parts are unavoidable. Only consolation is that they are cheaper,btohqsg
JDM kdm Vs conti....conti go hospital more often spare parts also more x,btohqsg
Ok la experience ma. Don own where got experience to tell,btohqsg
Want brand want satki  A3 lor,btohqsg
If want value for money and practicality and nicer than A3  go for Avante CN7,btohqsg
116 f20 still rwd. F40 fwd,btohqsg
But a3 such a shit car. Shit interior shit look,btohqsg
Audi wor some bro said Audi is a more atas VW version,btohqsg
If you have $$ test drive all the car you want and go for the one you like the most (comfort/looks etc)If you have budget then go for korea/jap car bcos end of the day is only point A to B.,btohqsg
Go hospital I also pay to drive....my baby,btohqsg
Golf is good choice for small families,btohqsg
Thanks all for ur inputs 🙏,btohqsg
Bro end of the day it’s your $$  you wanna spend on what you control. Other people opinion is not important bcos you are the one own the car and see the car everyday,btohqsg
My company also have a staff deal for kia Niro plus with dec 2023 reg  little mileage (drives from vessel to kia warehouse and routine lta inspection)  4 years warranty or 160k  1.5% interest. But I don't like the look leh,btohqsg
Don’t like then move on  go test drive everything you have in mind and get a feel,btohqsg
Life’s too short to drive a car that you don’t like 🤣,btohqsg
looks tbh most impt since u gonna spend so much already 🤣,btohqsg
Hello first time car buyer here  looking at getting a suv car with 3 coe years budget $30k below . Any suggestions nv??,btohqsg
Maybe looking at suv like Toyota rush,btohqsg
I mean the price of the car $30k with 2-3 year coe,btohqsg
30k still got plenty of options,btohqsg
I think ur first car u shld go with a jdm. Like a toyota. Any other car u get later is a upgrade,btohqsg
A3 is also 30k. Vezel also 30k. Even harrier also 30k,btohqsg
Show what? Cant u go sgcm and put in filter?,btohqsg
Bal 2yrs n below SUV are at 25-30,btohqsg
Bal 3yrs n abv r going for 30+k,btohqsg
U take 12-14k depre a year go count,btohqsg
Ya hes asking for bal 2-3 yrs isnt it?,btohqsg
Ya got a lot. But just not sure which model is the better option for suv,btohqsg
30k 3yrs... Thts abt 10k depre,btohqsg
Personal preference  I wldnt touch any cars thts 7yrs n older,btohqsg
7yrs older need prepare to fork out some cash for repair lo,btohqsg
No many of my pax complain,btohqsg
Say car high. Not used to it,btohqsg
Oh maybe ur side all used to sedan,btohqsg
But the general trend is going towards higher car like suv,btohqsg
I will say 99% Sinkies used to sedan. Already many female pax complain car high,btohqsg
higher car the view from uptop ma. Maybe clearer,btohqsg
Eh... i don think the statistic agrees with u though,btohqsg
Hi all  my car going scrap soon. Can i dekit my HKS Exhaust System before scrap so i can either install in new car/sell away?,btohqsg
I think I will switch back to sedan,btohqsg
Ur 99% from ur circle of friends?,btohqsg
Is legal exhaust  currently cert link to car number plater,btohqsg
If you can transfer it  why not,btohqsg
Kia showroom don even have a single sedan,btohqsg
The whole world is leaning towards suv though. Thats based on reports n survey worldwide,btohqsg
Still new to mods because when i bought the car  alrdy have the exhaust. Do i need to reinstall a stock exhaust kit?,btohqsg
New K Series debuting in 2025,btohqsg
If you want to dekit  then of course you need the stock exhaust. Or you intended to drive to scrapyard without any exhaust ?,btohqsg
Can i drive without exhaust? 😂,btohqsg
Usually SUV got higher view ma. In a way  it makes the driver feel ore assured and confident cos you see more and from a higher view,btohqsg
I see google say possible. But cos first car owner  dw anyhow,btohqsg
Can. But whether you will kena stop by authorities or not  that's another question.,btohqsg
Get a buyer who is willing to swap their stock exhaust with you loh if thats your concern,btohqsg
Might look for stock exhaust on the market. Might want to put the exhaust on my next car,btohqsg
The exhaust compatible with your next car ?,btohqsg
Ya bro  planning get exact same model haha,btohqsg
Well  its people's preference ma. Maybe they value the viewing angle more than COG and all.,btohqsg
"Plus Suv i suppose you dont need to ""bend"" to get into the car. So more comfortable in that sense",btohqsg
View angle might as well drive trailer truck. 3x higher,btohqsg
Bigger n more road presence. All scared siam away from u.,btohqsg
U compare A3 and A4 interior  a hell lot of difference. Audi A4 got 1.4  so if u really want badge and space  go A4. But underpowered as hell,btohqsg
In HERE FOR A GOOD TIME NOT A LONG TIME,btohqsg
Its more family friendly and a good choice with bootspace and easy to climb into.,btohqsg
Yes of cus lah bro🤣🤣 car no exhaust how drive,btohqsg
no too high some of the kids cried. Btw I fetch many pax a day,btohqsg
It’s not family friendly Becos same as sedan 5 seats but very high . Kids n females complain until I want change alr,btohqsg
Still can be done! Cabin size stroller light weight and durable!,btohqsg
I prefer suv or mpv over sedan as well,btohqsg
Getting into the car is so much easier,btohqsg
For now I single is golf  when got kids will be an SUV alr,btohqsg
Old alr ltr lug heavy stuff cannot bend down one😂,btohqsg
Sedan is the best. Lie down is always more comfortable than sit down,btohqsg
Ya I sat b4 it was amazing lol but expensive,btohqsg
Compared to Spada n the rest,btohqsg
Serena....I looking now most affordable suv,btohqsg
Noah I think damn good family car,btohqsg
But i dun like that series cus damn boxy,btohqsg
Walau the air resistance is like gao gao,btohqsg

Quality wise the latter is much better,btohqsg
Spada Voxy Serena at almost 200k range,btohqsg
Isnt noah higher class than voxy?,btohqsg
How to tell Noah is below Voxy?,btohqsg
Which mpv can only sit 6 ppl (2-2-2 layout)?,btohqsg

No such thing as break even. Even if Heng no major repair  drive to coe end still lose a lot $$,btohqsg
Sell half way lose more. Buy again lose even more,btohqsg

Bro we not the one complaining abt loss of $$. U are,btohqsg
I checked the chat history. U all complaining abt high coe more than anyone else,btohqsg
But i still buy my car?,btohqsg
High coe is not same as Loss of money when selling car. 5 yr most ppl break even. U say drive till end also lose $  but buy car is lose $,btohqsg
Repeat no such thing as break even. Buy car is cfm lose $$.,btohqsg
Unless u use it for doing business,btohqsg
Yes of cus  even if u use for business  motor expenses is still considered a loss. It only aids u in generating revenue.,btohqsg
not break even  but not lose extra money,btohqsg
Raining like this still want argue,btohqsg
Go chillax and enjoy the cold weather while we can,btohqsg
For those unfortunately stuck in SG,btohqsg
