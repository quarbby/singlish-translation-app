Hello does anyone have any clue on contrasting colors ?,btohqsg
This one is definitely more than sufficient,btohqsg
hmm okay thanks everyone who replied,btohqsg
Contrasting colours-There is a contrast in colour,btohqsg
Fr doe i need it for a project,btohqsg
So far i got 2 pairs,btohqsg
Yeah but i use wheel not really visually appealing,btohqsg
There are websites that can help u generate colour palettes based on base colours,btohqsg
Like the red and green im using isnt exactly oppositeRed:#Ff7273Green: 02c6b2,btohqsg
I just use this website for choosing colours,btohqsg
In terms of design u might want to pick a main colour and accent colour  have one dominate over the other and the accent colour is more of a balancing touch,btohqsg
I just wanted to try out stuff w colors,btohqsg
u can try how different colour synergise with each other,btohqsg
it's aimed for mobile devs  but the 5th placeholder is q good to help visualise i think,btohqsg
donate u 1 cent can bo,btohqsg
And I read before if your viral count low enough it won't transmit,btohqsg
