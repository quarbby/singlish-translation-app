If you‚Äôve activated the overseas ATM withdrawal function on the Trust App and you use your debit card overseas to withdraw cash: (1) The foreign currency withdrawal amount will be converted from US dollars into Singapore dollars at the foreign exchange rate provided by Visa with no fee from Trust (and if it‚Äôs not in US dollars  it will first be converted to US dollars). (2) We‚Äôll take the Singapore dollar amount out of your account. The overseas ATM operator may charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.,btohqsg
