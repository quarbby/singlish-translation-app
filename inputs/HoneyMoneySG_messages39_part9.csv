Guys  how do you manage 2 bank account? Can share some tips plsI am currently using Dbs multiplier and thinking to apply this,btohqsg
what do you mean manage? there's not much to manage usually. For accounts that you won't be using much (mostly parking money there) set all transaction limits to minimum via ibanking so at least if anything happens more likely you'll notice. Occasionally check account transactions  maybe 1-2 times a month  take a min or two to quickly login and browse thruFor important dates like when the EGA promo ends for your account  set something like a google calendar reminder,btohqsg
I just activated my new card replacement and realised i can't add into the amaze app .anyone with same issue ? For citibank reward card,btohqsg
Uob credit cards  tax  insurance giro are valid,btohqsg
So not useful to tie favepay with hsbc revolution cc,btohqsg
Hi guys  hsbc revolution card terms say excluded paying insurance for 10x points. Does that means that i still get points just not 10x when i use my cc for insurance?,btohqsg
no  totally 0. If u read the TnC  eligible transaction (10x point) and qualifying transaction (1x point)    qualifying transaction they alrd say specifically exclude insurance payment,btohqsg
oh thanks. I  misread that part,btohqsg
Hi folks  any convenient ways to clear the residual small amounts in Nestia and Grab wallet?,btohqsg
Hi for HSBC credit card  they write including but not limited to EZ-Link means if I use it as a EZ-Link card will not count into the qualifying spends ah?,btohqsg
it classifed under simplyGo as 4111 which it not been whitelisted by HSBC Revolution hence no 10x,btohqsg
But if I apply under Singsaver previously  does it counts as qualifying spends,btohqsg
it qualifying spend for Singsaver promo but you won‚Äôt earn the bonus reward  only base by the credit card,btohqsg
like HSBC Revolution you will only earn 1x Reward  compared to 10x on whitelisted MCC,btohqsg
Why $2k? Is that the minimum? The higher the deposit  the higher will be the interest we get right?,btohqsg
