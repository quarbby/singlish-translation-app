Isn‚Äôt moonlight like a second job,btohqsg
He have a second job at night?,btohqsg
He's such a nice guy minus the abuse part. He thinking of the future and work two job to satisfy the gf,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the deal breaking part of moonlight tho,btohqsg
True  maybe the abuse is just scolding  I mean all relationship have argument also,btohqsg
Even then if you construe minor arguments as abuse then it‚Äôs not abuse but it is incompatibility that is the deal breaker,btohqsg
"""EVEN moonlighted during his whole NS""   that seem like a pretty serious issue@Holdyourplace",btohqsg
Are u JC or poly or uni,btohqsg
U will be a good counsellor,btohqsg
Now uk why i say necessity,btohqsg
Tbh moonlighting i think is a grey thing,btohqsg
Because I get too attached to things  I‚Äôll bring my clients worries home and stress myself out,btohqsg
True  but it shows ure good at it and u truly care,btohqsg
U will make a good partner for whomever u choose to marry üëç,btohqsg
But I mean  not In serious occasion la,btohqsg
Whut? Moonlight = cheat your way through life??,btohqsg
Like some small class test u never do work  than u just ask ur friend haha,btohqsg
Latter and former are only used when there are two variables hahaha here got three it doesnt make sense,btohqsg
Tell me if you got my meaning,btohqsg
For me moon light is a small issue,btohqsg
All the time haha  like all those not serious one  but serious occasion I know ah,btohqsg
I dk if uni or poly,btohqsg
If u can carry out ur operational duties efficiently  i dont see whats wrong with it,btohqsg
Like during PE  they ask us run,btohqsg
Than I always cut and take short cut,btohqsg
But chao keng is just fked up,btohqsg
I mean when I slack and cheat it doesn't affect anyone ah,btohqsg
It just my life more easy,btohqsg
Not like slack and make someone else do the work,btohqsg
But the same qualities can also manifest in the person hackcaring institutionally entrenched inefficient practices to come up with a more efficient process,btohqsg
Imagine if 13 trillion cells in ur body.. ur heart cells decided to slack,btohqsg
But we don‚Äôt understand the bf as a whole thru that conf to comment,btohqsg
I can't understand this   can u explain in simpler terms,btohqsg
13 trillion cells working for u until they die never take break always pushing themseleves regardless of heat or what,btohqsg
Like when I walk to sch  I always take the shortest path and lift cos i lazy walk the longer path  is that something wrong also,btohqsg
I‚Äôm extrapolating qualities from the situation  just like how OP and we are (ignoring abuse),btohqsg
Yea  maybe efficiency is a better word,btohqsg
I always do things the most efficient way to save my energy,btohqsg
Chao keng is diff  I understand,btohqsg
I never support those slacking that cause burden on others. Just those that make our life's a tiny bit easier,btohqsg
If we‚Äôre talking about ethics in the context of NS  I‚Äôm out. Not my place to comment.,btohqsg
Not he she they but it,btohqsg
*‚ÄùI‚Äù Here refers to ‚ÄúPlace Holder‚Äù,btohqsg
632 new cases today  9 local,btohqsg
Keep us on lockdown is good,btohqsg
bold of you to assume I'm not fat to begin with,btohqsg
How much money did that cost,btohqsg
I thinking of getting an iPad or Microsoft surface book in my uni   but the price is like $2000+ dollar,btohqsg
If anyone got second hand iPad and want to sell  let me know  I'll consider,btohqsg
I mean actually not wrong ah,btohqsg
Nono  I saying him putting it   but it was meant as a joke,btohqsg
Executive member of the telegram department at SgExams,btohqsg
It‚Äôs probably the most meaningful out of all the compulsory VIAs that your Teachers plan and you‚Äôre just a replaceable cog in the Machinery,btohqsg
What VIA they expect us to do during circuit breaker,btohqsg
WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO THAT WE NEED VIA TO ENCOURAGE THAT,btohqsg
Like I help a blind man get an mrt seat on various ocassion  but just because it's not getting recorded in a VIA booklet doesn't mean we don't do it,btohqsg
There is like 10 adults sitting on the damn mrt sit with a blind man standing,btohqsg
And I had to ask the adults,btohqsg
To let the blind man sit,btohqsg
actually did this for a blind lady but my DM never k drama me and see me do it smh,btohqsg
How tf u want a blind man go to an empty seat,btohqsg
It might not occur to them,btohqsg
Life is just one big portfolio,btohqsg
I saw them staring at him as he use his pole to walk in,btohqsg
But they just put their head down afterwards,btohqsg
Esp the guy at the priority seat,btohqsg
The stillborn growls from its grave,btohqsg
Must keep body cam at all times so all your good deeds are recorded,btohqsg
H2 phy peeps how yall study physics ?,btohqsg
Clearly not meant for this subject,btohqsg
I didnt write that in my VIA,btohqsg
tbh sgexams got me really really far in terms of job apps and uni apps,btohqsg
like your sec sch and jc stuff is really irrelevant,btohqsg
its mostly the extra-curricular stuff that gets you places,btohqsg
U heard it from the expert@chemcer,btohqsg
Actually alot of place need volunteers,btohqsg
Cos covid everyone suddenly stop volunteering,btohqsg
It's a one off thing right,btohqsg
I remember I saw the opportunity last year also,btohqsg
But now pasir ris D resort use for covid patient haha,btohqsg
When I was in sec 2,btohqsg
If within 6hour of volunteering inside got less than a certain amount,btohqsg
Cos like it's obvious the student slacking,btohqsg
Cos i think inside only got like 20dollar from 6hour,btohqsg
Yeah alot of them doing it for the sake of VIA,btohqsg
Quite sad what our society have become,btohqsg
That's why doesn't mean elite sch means the student is good also,btohqsg
And doesn't mean neighbourhood sch means student is bad,btohqsg
U know what I hate the most,btohqsg
Those donation that have a minimum sum,btohqsg
They were like  I'm not here to sell u thing,btohqsg
But we need to help etc etc,btohqsg
They saying only 10dollar can help them  5 dollar cannot,btohqsg
Than everytime I tell them I'm a student,btohqsg
Than u know what he say,btohqsg
Than I say I rushing for sch,btohqsg
Than he say I can take mrt with u,btohqsg
I was 17 a few weeks ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
and u know they don't even have a tin?,btohqsg
They can just take the money out,btohqsg
You just need to loudly say your objective and beneficiary  ppl will come,btohqsg
They could have just take 10dollar out,btohqsg
They flash to me their QR code,btohqsg
U can scan this QR code now,btohqsg
Like it's some sort of scam sia,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  minimum is 10dollar,btohqsg
Like why would a guy need a hair salon voucher haha,btohqsg
And feel like u owe them,btohqsg
I‚Äôm those kind abit paiseh to talk to stranger one to one. Esp if Chinese  I need to determine based on looks if it is a Jiak kantang Chinese  or Chinese educated Chinese.Coz like paiseh to use the Lang they don‚Äôt speak  but since idh a proficient enough Malay or know any Indian Lang  I have no options for those 2 demographic anyway.So instead of approaching ppl 1 to 1  I proclaim to the crowd.,btohqsg
That's the first trick up their sleeve,btohqsg
Got this guy trying to sell us a cheap pen,btohqsg
With this and that health conditions,btohqsg
"I think is too many ""charities""",btohqsg
Bring a spare wallet  leave it empty. Take that out  shoe it to them.,btohqsg
U know when I say I no money,btohqsg
They ask me to take out my wallet,btohqsg
They are streamlining the VWO sector  but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre streamlining the charities.,btohqsg
Too bad I no have POSB|DBS,btohqsg
They say they can follow u and take mrt also,btohqsg
But he got the qr code,btohqsg
Let me speak to ur supervisor,btohqsg
Stand there like a rock obv difficult,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt expect ppl to ask you to determine whether they want to donate,btohqsg
If do tin can flag raising  you must behave like a popup ad,btohqsg
People didn‚Äôt know that they wanted to donate to this cause  but they happen to hear about it  some will ignore = closing the ad  some will click.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for a cause that I think is worthy and the organisation is reputable for the higher chances the money is spent well,btohqsg
But they need to popup ad me  I‚Äôm not going to walk to a statue  hello where are you from  for what cause?,btohqsg
I am not a philanthropist so free to do that,btohqsg
A few years ago I help for YMCA and YWCA,btohqsg
They both quite well known I tjink,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fun to stay at the,btohqsg
You know when I learnt what YMCA stands for  I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs legal to use that song in MOE‚Äôs supposedly secular schools,btohqsg
U can go and walk the dogs üòçüòç,btohqsg
Bring the dogs to walk walk,btohqsg
U can also volunteer as SpCa advocate,btohqsg
U should try   they need alot of help,btohqsg
And they have no choice but to put down some animals down cos no enough funds to feed them,btohqsg
And they are feeding animals to animals,btohqsg
Like the zebra they feed to the lion etc,btohqsg
Oh fuck owning a hotel is even more crazy than owning a shopping mall,btohqsg
Solving 2 problems at one go,btohqsg
John are you just memeing or did you actually stay there before,btohqsg
Other country their zoo very ead,btohqsg
Did u see the cage they are put in,btohqsg
Still remember last time Danga Bay got Zoo,btohqsg
Singapore Zoo is good because it simultaneously functions as an animal sanctuary,btohqsg
Most other countries sanctuary and zoos are separate,btohqsg
But I wonder how did our polar bear die tho,btohqsg
I thought with current medical advancemnt,btohqsg
But I mean the polar bear quite old already also,btohqsg
The polar bear exhibition was a sign that Singapore Zoo was straying away from sanctuary to a Zoo,btohqsg
Thankfully public backlash kept them on track,btohqsg
Did u see the recent news of the panda haha,btohqsg
Apparently they show the male panda p*rn,btohqsg
I send yall the news later,btohqsg
But if really successful tho  can tell Chuan Jin  this is why action movies are congruent with family values,btohqsg
Why need mods? This one can POFMA  aim higher. Unless you say cannot üòè,btohqsg
I swear I‚Äôm discovering new Pepe stickers eberidey,btohqsg
Seems like the SGExams administration needs a purge,btohqsg

The pigs have morph inyo humans,btohqsg
An entirely new administration please. Drain the swamp  not just the cover.,btohqsg
U need a new owner first,btohqsg
Who could u be talking about hmm,btohqsg
4 letters has 2 vowels in the middle,btohqsg

3months is enough to build a relationship,btohqsg
Surface Book a lot more expensive than iPad isn't it?,btohqsg

Haiz how to get fools‚Äô cap now,btohqsg
Petition for members of SGExams to be referred to as SGExaminees instead. Besides  it isn‚Äôt wrong.,btohqsg
There is no limit to the amount of demonyms I can come up with,btohqsg
I used examinees in the previous portal post,btohqsg
I want you to limit it to just SGExaminees  just because.,btohqsg
Anyway  here‚Äôs a legit petition that‚Äôs worth supporting:https://www.change.org/p/for-a-commission-of-inquiry-into-covid-19-spread-in-singapore-s-migrant-worker-community?recruiter=951749127&recruited_by_id=8197a510-5d1b-11e9-bcfc-3dde227e335c&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard,btohqsg
Where they complain about the food and all,btohqsg
are you not already familiar with it?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs only scary if you read about it,btohqsg
If u just ignore it then it‚Äôs perfectly fine,btohqsg
wasn't there something like how the covid can fuck alot of other things up too,btohqsg
or how it can be like hiv and stay in you forever,btohqsg
This petition not about the food but about the prevention of COVID19 in dorms,btohqsg
wow john by any chance are you heading the public health policy of the usa,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why USA is the #1 country in the world,btohqsg
Afaik no computing course requires u to learn ‚Äúweb development‚Äù,btohqsg
Why not css and js also since doing web development,btohqsg
i'm gonna learn html as my first programming language,btohqsg
Its technically more of an organiser than a language,btohqsg
someone told me html was a programming language!,btohqsg
Well u can say its a language that tells the screen how to organise what u wrote,btohqsg
nice ok html will be my first programming language,btohqsg
Actually query languages like sql also can skip,btohqsg
Idk what kind of development he doing,btohqsg
Totally not sgeducators‚Äô poorly optimised website,btohqsg
Ytd got ppl asking about seo optimisation,btohqsg
Seo online alot of resources eh,btohqsg
sql will be my 2nd programming language,btohqsg
Sql is not a programming language though,btohqsg
alright guys stop ruining my dreams,btohqsg
Literal flow of web development goesHtml css3 js (php/sql) python etc,btohqsg
Then after that u spend another 7 types of js modules,btohqsg
Ajax jquery angular node and so on,btohqsg
Then u realise u have wasted ur life,btohqsg
ok web dev sounds hard i'm out,btohqsg
U do software engineering mod alrdy right,btohqsg
Sorry im not good i never learn html and web development hahaha sorry,btohqsg
Only the IT course requires web programming,btohqsg
i think i can teach some html <h1> hello world </h1>,btohqsg
damn i think i got mocked,btohqsg
what's that i've never used that language before,btohqsg
Thanks am workin at googl now,btohqsg
yw sir. glad to be of some help,btohqsg
New member need to wait 1 day before they can send images in this group,btohqsg
This is data structure and algo arh,btohqsg
But things like minimum spanning tree is not hard to get it,btohqsg
U can google data structure tutorials and videos tbh. Thats how most ppl self learn .-.,btohqsg
U can download competitive programming book,btohqsg
Can learn data structure and algo there,btohqsg
Indians on youtube teach algo theory really well,btohqsg
I was trying to automate certain parts of my js using AI and pathfinder,btohqsg
I needed it to be specific to js,btohqsg
HAHAHA idw to install custom languages on my server,btohqsg
turns out u can do it in html5 and jquery,btohqsg
This one confirm plus chop in python,btohqsg
If i wanted to use python i would be using flask lib,btohqsg
Their project is to build a bot playing tetris,btohqsg
This one is deep learning mah,btohqsg
Yah these are industry relevant tools,btohqsg
Up till now I still dk the difference between deep learning and machine learning,btohqsg
I know one is supposed to be broader in scope,btohqsg
U learn simple python iteration based pathfinder,btohqsg
Which one more revevant in industires hahaha,btohqsg
Deep learning just a fanciful name of neural network,btohqsg
I dont think many jobs need to do deep learning,btohqsg
At least they dont need deep understanding of the theory,btohqsg
But iteration based one is becoming outdated alr,btohqsg
Machine learning comprises of other things other than neural network,btohqsg
If ur code is just looping over if else until exit clause it met,btohqsg
I saw some news online about worker asking for apology haha,btohqsg
Okay fr fellas where tf to get foolscap,btohqsg
Maybe we should start investing in ipad,btohqsg
Im literally writing on class photos back page,btohqsg
I dont have that kind of time luxury,btohqsg
Time to write on my body parts,btohqsg
How does it feel having a brain that big,btohqsg
wow thats a lot of roles,btohqsg
the roles arent really fixed so like anyone can take up the responsibility eh,btohqsg
My group only had one role,btohqsg
Partly because only one person was doing work,btohqsg
Anyone got use studocs before ?,btohqsg
Not sure about that but i wanna download files from it,btohqsg
But it wants me to upload uni files to download,btohqsg
Lol how do you know that,btohqsg
Gordon I promise I won‚Äôt ban you if you enter with your real account for once,btohqsg
Alright  we don't ban you if you don't do anything funny,btohqsg
Is just that we have had a lot of alts invade our chats,btohqsg
Delete me from this futile existence pls,btohqsg
P = phgP/p = hghg = 1,btohqsg
Idu how tf gravity works its way in that shizzle,btohqsg
Density = pressure x height x constant g?,btohqsg
Heyyy I still remember my physics,btohqsg
Pressure at a depth depends on the weight of the water above,btohqsg
Huh isnt pressure and density swap,btohqsg
Okay I dont know my physics at all,btohqsg
On mars pressure will be less than on earth,btohqsg
Weight of the water  W = mass √ó g. Mass = volume √ó density  so W = Vpg,btohqsg
W = PA  and V = hA,btohqsg
If you cancel out the terms,btohqsg
Cant wait until i reach fluid dynamics,btohqsg
The course was a childhood dream until i realised my inabilty to grasp physics,btohqsg
It is also a method to determine if roots are real,btohqsg
It‚Äôs because you said it in small letters  which denotes disrespect,btohqsg
excuse me so john more real than me,btohqsg
What course are you studying now,btohqsg
For professional internships how does it work,btohqsg
From what i was told first come first serve,btohqsg
Like you choose which company you wanna work for,btohqsg
70% phy 20% maths 5% lab 3% other stuff 2%bio,btohqsg
Theres only 2 pure bio mods,btohqsg
Then whats the diff from other eng subfields,btohqsg
Every other mod with bio name in it explains the physics behind it,btohqsg
But when i see the eqns,btohqsg
And wonder how am i gonna do that shit,btohqsg
Coz the bio part of said mods is fucjing easy. Even non bio kid can understand the concept,btohqsg
U tell me despite that u dont understand cell membrane potential due to charge ions,btohqsg
Only thing I rmb is 'partial permable membrane' from sec school days,btohqsg
To drive charged particles in the cell?,btohqsg
But instead of teaching u ionic flow,btohqsg
This is just 1 small subsection of one mod,btohqsg
The litmus test can vouch for my neutrality,btohqsg
Damn the temperature must be 25degree c and pressure must be 1 bar,btohqsg
I forgot all my JC chem,btohqsg
I'm the product of numerous acid base reactions,btohqsg
Must feel nice to be able to forget all these things,btohqsg
Solely based on acid base rxn,btohqsg
It wont add u to groups,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure the adder bot does nothing,btohqsg
K invited aron invites some other fella,btohqsg
All of them in the covid grp,btohqsg
Interesting they removed themselves as i just said this,btohqsg
Also the k guy is the ‚Äúweb development‚Äù guy,btohqsg
Arent u a study grp mod,btohqsg
