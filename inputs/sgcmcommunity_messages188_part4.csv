Users dun wan to pay more  yet wan to the dot maintenance  how can that be possible,btohqsg
That's why I kept saying car sharing too cheap liao  companies unable to keep up with the maintenance  users suffer in the end,btohqsg
Thats why I say no to rental cars now. Buy my own car.Even if my friend want to do grab  I will rather partner him to buy a COE or PARF car  I will do oil change and replace a set of good tyres.Dont let rental company give you subpar car and horrible insurance excess.,btohqsg
Really  Buy car looks expensive but actually cheaper in the sense that you can heck care any small damages lol,btohqsg
YES! If it is going to be scrap anyway  why bother lol,btohqsg
"unless you are driving ""Collector's"" car like me  small little details dont OCD abt it haha",btohqsg
Hard ah  cos to maintain well needs additional manpower and costs  car sharing is Charging so low,btohqsg
No cus PAYMENT GOES TO FINANCING THE DAMN CAR,btohqsg
Where do you get your brake pads from?,btohqsg
I be honest also  even it coe comes down  prices gna remain status quo,btohqsg
DOn't feel fast to me.But I believe driver applying brakes contributed to the issue.If brake balance is not there  throwing off the weight of the car to cause left rear tyre to loose traction,btohqsg
Mine will auto slowly brake if the car going too fast .,btohqsg
Well  just saying if the brakes aren't balance  tyres rabak  this could happen.sad thing is that the road don't even look wet.,btohqsg
Maybe the passengers or the driver is heavy 😁😁,btohqsg
Rented car very difficult to have brakes balance . Everyday used by different people . Driving habit also different,btohqsg
Too many new cars instead of parf or coe cars,btohqsg
Like to say if u dun own the thing  ur not gna treat it right,btohqsg
Just look at the bicycle sharing will do,btohqsg
Car sharing there are ppl who use it to worksites or transport seafood cos dun wan to dirty their own car also. Such users and green drivers adding on to the costs  how to regulate such aspects?,btohqsg
