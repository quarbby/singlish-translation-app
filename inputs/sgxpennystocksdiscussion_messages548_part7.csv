QUOTE...Pika World maintains that high energy prices are likely to continue their traction and can spell trouble. Historically  a swift upward movement in oil prices is often accompanied by recessions. Oil prices did shoot up before theDot.combust in 2000. Similarly  it rose sharply before the financial crisis and continued till the end of the recession.Energy shortage in US  Europe  Asia and SEA....keep cash first....,btohqsg
