Fun to own and fun to drive,btohqsg
If u have no pref choose lease,btohqsg
For me I like to buy,btohqsg
Precisely. A car is just a tool to bring me from point A to B.,btohqsg
Then leasing is the way for you,btohqsg
No need a lump sum to dp also,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your perspectives! Appreciate the time to share ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
Of course in an ideal world,btohqsg
Born in this country everything is pap,btohqsg
Ui walk pass c c only......straight turn to toilet,btohqsg
I will lease after my COE ends. Will have this new perspective thereafter. No need to have too much emotions tied to a car.,btohqsg
Had to park there for 3 days for work... Spent like 70 bucks,btohqsg
Ya lo that's y I say crazy,btohqsg
Even if u throw in hybrid I do not think it's worth,btohqsg
A few more years u wont see bnb cars alr. Only luxury,btohqsg
idm  no need house liao  can just stay in car,btohqsg
U got house liao lah broðŸ˜¶,btohqsg
seems like general sentiment is COE price is too high and insane.. means likely gonna see drop in demand? drop in demand means COE price will drop?,btohqsg
More maintenance if first owner is shit..,btohqsg
Also roads in sg are increasing (tengah new town  punggol expansion etc) but coe quota is not?,btohqsg
One bus stop so far away,btohqsg
Damn that's how they justify not increasing quota right ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³,btohqsg
That's my wedding car. Borrow one ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
And grab car and rental cars to go back and forth to new towns,btohqsg
Leasing now costs 2k or more a month.vby a few yrs time it may hit 3k or 4kc amonth to lease a car.,btohqsg
coe up = leasing up also. Cus they alr paying maintenance and road tax. Must cover somehow to maintain profit margin no,btohqsg
So those who Don have lum some cash to down pay 70k 90k for car and loan the balance. Then go leasing lor. Earn 6k pay 2k to lease.,btohqsg
Left 2k to eat and everything else,btohqsg
No ba  got 1k plus but is those coe cars,btohqsg
If u lease an altis 10 years  assume 2k per month is alr 240k. U buy a new one 170k  with interest on 30% dp and then road tax + maintenance  only about 220k (maintenance is 1k per year  w road tax assumption 600/year),btohqsg
For those who got no cash to downplay,btohqsg
But can fork out 1.5k 2k a mth for a car. Then lease is 1 way,btohqsg
This is true  cos when you buy your own  the profit part is out of the monthly expenses equation when compared to leasing,btohqsg
Our assumption is hold car all the way to the end lo,btohqsg
Own car benefit is u still can do lalamove or grab hitch part time,btohqsg
Still cost amount to the same lo,btohqsg
Unless suddenly change to diff car,btohqsg
Prior to buying my Stonic  I was looking to lease a Jimmy,btohqsg
The dealer quoted me no more than 2000km a mth,btohqsg
Ya. But thing is  lease u can every change car regularly,btohqsg
Owned  u hug car n die,btohqsg
But looking at the COE  leasing cld be the way to go for now,btohqsg
But leasing these days also getting out of hand,btohqsg
Everything in SG is out of hand,btohqsg
Own car also can change every 1-2 years,btohqsg
If u rich enough to keep paying down payment and early penalty,btohqsg
But i forgot u 100% loan,btohqsg
Most  if not all  the penalty is just before a year,btohqsg
My first installment etc etc also put inside the loan,btohqsg
Technically you just need to dp once,btohqsg
