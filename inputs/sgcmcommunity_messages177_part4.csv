They just need to seperate PHV frm Private Cars will do,btohqsg
Then limit the number of PHV cars,btohqsg
Then disallow the conversion of phv to private,btohqsg
And then private to phv can only be done once,btohqsg
PHv shud follow formula like taxi,btohqsg
Eg based on population then no bidding,btohqsg
Maybe 10 years scrap n sell haha,btohqsg
I think a lot of planning for PHV was done,btohqsg

They won't give up on carlite la  whoever or whichever party is governing will realise that it is impossible to remove COE without imposing new tax that will have the same effect to deter buyer from getting their own vehicle.,btohqsg
Now so many non car owner already accustomed to using PHV  removing those and give the COE to a handful of car owners will look damn ugly on the government,btohqsg
Like taking public resources and only giving to the elites that can afford,btohqsg
But i guess it'll have to do for now to ensure some form of price moderation,btohqsg
Kill of those 5yrs n 10yrs renewed coe,btohqsg
By thn more quota cos no more diesel car,btohqsg
But more coe means pi can buy more new cars n get rid of their older cars by exporting or convert to phv,btohqsg
