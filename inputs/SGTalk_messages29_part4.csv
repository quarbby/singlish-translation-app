David and his 4 frens went level 9 for a night of fun. It was full house  so the mummy advised the guys to book their girls. After looking at the situation David booked his girl  but he was paying only 300  thus the girl butterfly one extra room beside his.Now Lim Peh and his 4 former NS buddy just arrived at the ktv. Lim Peh had alrdy messaged his regular girl he would be coming. And by sure coincidence  this was the same girl booked by David. Lim Peh was a bit not song that his regular girl had to butterfly  so he followed her and sneak a peek at the room she was in. But because the light was so dark in the room  all he saw was his own reflection.David meanwhile was enjoying his girl as her tongue flicked vigorously on his nipples. He slowly pushed her head lower and lower  knowing what he wanted  a metallic zip sound was heard.Just at this moment  a waiter came in to pour the beer and it was at that moment....Lim Peh saw what was happening in the room with his regular girl and David. Their eyes met. And an unspoken spark of passion was ignited.1 hour later.. Lim Peh and his fens waited below for David and his frens to appear.And the rest you can see in the video [Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin][Grin],btohqsg
