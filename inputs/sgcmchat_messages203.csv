"hi guys! i've been visiting singapore since wednesday and i've used a getgo car twice since then (from airport to my hotel on wednesday and a longer drive around singapore today)now they have suspended my account and are demanding that i pay a combined 800 sgd of ""clean up fees"" cause i smoked in the cars.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è does anyone have any idea if i can end up in trouble if i just ignore it and don't pay?",btohqsg
You can definitely end up in trouble,btohqsg
idiot. but he‚Äôs not a bot,btohqsg
welp. that's on you  you didn't read the T&Cs. ALL rentals are non smoking.,btohqsg
and yes you are liable and can be sued,btohqsg
but like how? they weren't able to charge my card and i'm leaving in three weeks,btohqsg
legal troubles are still a thing,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not a lawyer so i can‚Äôt advise,btohqsg
but just so you know  it‚Äôs extremely hard to win a case against a rental company,btohqsg
many have tried and many have failed,btohqsg
yeah i know they are but i didn't think i could really end up in trouble for smoking,btohqsg
you're visiting the one country that's known for fines,btohqsg
for sure they can't get me to court in three weeks,btohqsg
GetGo is very particular about who‚Äôs in the driver seat,btohqsg
To be fair emma  no obligation to pay if u not returning,btohqsg
oh but they sure as hell can find ways to get you to pay up,btohqsg
yeahhhhh i've found out by now üòÖ,btohqsg
up to you if you wanna run,btohqsg
i've heard of a couple cases where overseas authorities were contacted,btohqsg
exactly what i thought.. and like even if i return one day it's just a clean up fee from a random car rental company,btohqsg
that aside it's a moral thing,btohqsg
i'm more than certain getgo's T&Cs denote no smoking,btohqsg
you fucked up  you face the music imo,btohqsg
yeah i thought so but it's just their own rules and not the law,btohqsg
those driving today  take note high TP/LTA activity in north side üôèüèª,btohqsg
when rules are broken  it still means you are liable,btohqsg
you can get out of SG but if they do choose to persue it  which is definitely the most likely case  you might be double-fucked,btohqsg
Damn common china kids come US take credit card debt and spend the limit afterwards fuck right back to china,btohqsg
i'm sure telegrams t&cs say don't be an idiot but still this thing is full of idiots who get away with it üòÇ,btohqsg
once again  tourists disrespecting the rules,btohqsg
i‚Äôm so confused what you‚Äôre talking about now,btohqsg
Eh don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre all holy when you go into JB,btohqsg
you broke a ruleyou‚Äôre liable for paymentthey can seek the law because it‚Äôs an official signed contractwhat does that have to do with being an idiot?,btohqsg
i praise allah when i check my waze reports,btohqsg
but i don't think they will cause i don't live here,btohqsg
that is up to your own discretion,btohqsg
in the case they do pursue this case,btohqsg
you will need to fork out more  and if they do contact your local authoritiesthere will be more hassle,btohqsg
there have been 2 cases that i know of where they have.,btohqsg
one thai tourist and one american.,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a private company,btohqsg
you‚Äôre in Singapore  don‚Äôt rent cars here unless you want to be faulted for no reason,btohqsg
this is how they earn money,btohqsg
thai tourist had a damage fee of 1.8k  they had to pay 3k++ in the end,btohqsg
but i haven't caused any damage,btohqsg
tbvf cleaning fees if you return the cars nicely is around 20-30 bucks,btohqsg
you don't do that here unless you own it or the rules allow it,btohqsg
rules are rules  suck it up,btohqsg
HAHAHA I THOUGHT 800 WAS FIRST TIME,btohqsg
it doesn't cost them 800 to roll up the windows for a while and spray some air freshener..,btohqsg
live with the consequences of your actions and stop being dense,btohqsg
it doesn‚Äôt cost them $10k to repair a car but they still charge $10k,btohqsg
i feel $800 okay la jus pay lor,btohqsg
you have read and gone through the terms & conditions  you have to work with it,btohqsg
i feel i need see your face later,btohqsg
tourist  angmoh  not unexpected la hor,btohqsg
i feed you halal pork then uk,btohqsg
benchod bloody bastard bloody fucking why you fuck me i fuck you bloody fucking bastard what the fuck man fucking fuck,btohqsg
love it how car rental companies can threaten ppl as if they are the police,btohqsg
that‚Äôs pretty tame compared to how other companies do debt collection?,btohqsg
i have no idea  i have no debts in singapore,btohqsg
please realise the world doesn't revolve around you,btohqsg
well you can get your credit fucked over in your country,btohqsg
for a policy that‚Äôs written  it‚Äôs pretty okayi‚Äôve seen worse,btohqsg
i mean rather than this i would rather say,btohqsg
AHEM rental company with TC initials,btohqsg
you need to understand Singapore is not what you think,btohqsg
you're not getting the point of WHY you're being charged and the fact that you can't skirt around it,btohqsg
singapore isn't malaysia or thailand where you can haggle and snuggle your way past laws,btohqsg
nobody here will agree with you over these common occurancesthen again  most will reccommend you to stay out of trouble,btohqsg
bro i swear the person is trolling,btohqsg
well you do owe $800 to GetGo,btohqsg
no i get it but 800 dollars.....,btohqsg
my car was $3.90 at toys r us,btohqsg
