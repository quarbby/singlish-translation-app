How does ITE General Education work ðŸ¤” ?,btohqsg
I know they gt o level courses of sorts,btohqsg
ite's converting to mostly higher nitec courses now ( only some courses & mostly school of engineerinh haven't convert yet )so usually it's a 3yr program  unless a student took O levels or they enrolled in a DPP ( direct poly programme ) course in ITE first,btohqsg
