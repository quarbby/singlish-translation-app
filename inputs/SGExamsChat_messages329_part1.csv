Examiner: Please have a seatMe: Don‚Äôt mind if I do*lifts chair and walks a metre away before coming back*I managed to get an A for english so I guess this somehow worked. I remember being nervous enough to think this was a great idea during the prep time. Had to get rid of that nervous energy somehow  and the examiner laughed after realising the crummy joke.Bottomline is‚Ä¶ forget the big picture and focus on just being in the room. Take the exam with a focus of just answering the questions well and remind your mind to stay in the room.Just do your best with what you have  know that you did your best at the time  then tackle the next problem when it comes :),btohqsg
