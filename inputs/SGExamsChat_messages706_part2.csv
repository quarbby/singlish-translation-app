The only arts subj with prereq are the Chinese related ones/MTLL and ELL  and maybe Art/Music (can take w/o taking at O level though),btohqsg
but they donâ€™t call it pw,btohqsg

H1 will only be counted if(3H2 + 1H1 + GP)/80x 70 more than 3H2 + GP,btohqsg
what happens if they score well for both h1 and mother tongue,btohqsg
Did a google search  apparently yes,btohqsg
I thought only rebased if your score improves the rp,btohqsg
Cuz the current one if h1 mt also improve the score it will be rebased fr 100 to 90,btohqsg
I mean yes itâ€™s calculated like that  but if all your subjects do relatively well  the rebased score will be lower than the 70rp 4 subj score,btohqsg
Is only rebase if it make ur score btr,btohqsg
I think if it only improves the rank points then rebase,btohqsg
Im not sure if it is just h1 sci or what but apparently ppl tend to do better in their h2s lol,btohqsg
