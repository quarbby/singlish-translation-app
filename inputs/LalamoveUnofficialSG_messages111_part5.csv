Fully agree. It is just a platform for people to earn extra income. Drivers come and go. Won’t waste time contacting CS unless it is necessary and if I do  it is basically used as evidence.,btohqsg
I remember last year Christmas period  I took a lot of jobs by Collins at Bedok Food City and all their jobs were so delayed as they could not cope with the orders. I didn’t want to wait further so livechat CS but there was no response at all. The jobs on my app were still showing in progress until the next day!,btohqsg
in out instant $2.90 or $4.90 alr,btohqsg
I also kena b4 the job still there nxt morning. Just wait until nxt morning cs open again then cancel,btohqsg
I don't mind taking paragon if can stack 2 jobs from there with +$. Cos can cover cp n more. But then again  it's the time wastage cos of traffic that makes me think twice😂,btohqsg
Besides car park rate  traffic is the main issue for Takashimaya. I try to avoid especially on Saturdays.,btohqsg
Yup  peak period go in n come out can take quite some time,btohqsg
