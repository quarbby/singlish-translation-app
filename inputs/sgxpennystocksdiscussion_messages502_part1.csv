good thing is counter is stacked after consolidation. It shows the bankers are around.,btohqsg
Target price is always set by somebody. If hit 8  how for those that buy at 8? Of course target price becomes 10,btohqsg
If based on nav  buy property counters better. See how much nav for Hong fok,btohqsg
Sadly... Singapore market can only play for dividend...,btohqsg
true but many want quick excitement so they play pennies ahha  myself included,btohqsg
For me  never see nav for loss making companies. Cash flow more important,btohqsg
Yup true. Amos must show improvement in their financials if they want game,btohqsg
This stock behaving like previously will hang on to top vol for sometime,btohqsg
Ultimately  the safest type of play is FA+TA+Volume + BBs commitment = HuatHuat.,btohqsg
But a Blumont stock will happen every year,btohqsg
This stock I donâ€™t like always one day wonder,btohqsg
many traders just see chart and never see FA. but it is sufficient because TA will usually win FA for SGX market.,btohqsg
Now you can sell  if you hold and hold and never sell  who can help ?,btohqsg
i think Chasen can be a GKE 2.0. There have been a lot of accumulation IMO. reminds me of GKE when it was ranging,btohqsg
Chasen always like to sell on news  very tricky.. more for those who understand its intrinsic FA and mid to longer term play I guess  contra unlikely to earn this counter,btohqsg
anyways  like to ask your view on the FA of CSE Global since you are the FA guy here bro. Results tomorrow evening. Would you bet this one,btohqsg
Yea  not easy to play this one. Those hard to play counters will always perform big when they finally break. But hard to time it,btohqsg
