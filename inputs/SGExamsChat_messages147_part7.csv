Nice  is it one of the top airlines? Or anything like 5-star?,btohqsg
But if it tastes very nice  who cares if it is coffee or tea or something else?,btohqsg
It only went bankrupt last year. So they sealed the engines and parked the planes at Manchester waiting to be sold,btohqsg
Don't use the star rating by Skytrax for airlines. It is known to be unreliable. Definitely not 5 star in my opinion but they have improved a lot since last time from what I heard.,btohqsg
For northern england it depends. But you must be willing to pay if you want better Chinese food  although not amazing. Don't bother about singaporean food. I am not a fan of Singaporean food so it doesn't really matter to me,btohqsg
Have you heard of the paternoster lift in Sheffield? I went to visit my friend there and it is so fun to ride,btohqsg
