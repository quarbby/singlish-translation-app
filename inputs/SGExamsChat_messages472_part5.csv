Are you familiar with ML AI mods btw,btohqsg
No. I only know OL and AL Physics,btohqsg
Me? Yeah I did all that in uni,btohqsg
Shit like simi sai a* algo,btohqsg
Its a raid boss module for me too,btohqsg
I mean all AI have but don‚Äôt do NLP,btohqsg
Uni stuff mainly never use one,btohqsg
because what you are training is your thinking processes,btohqsg
Yeah  I can feel that I changed psychologically after university,btohqsg
a level time I thought I know what stress is,btohqsg
it's actually the same for AL Physics  too many students focus on the worked solutions when they shouldn't.It should be the thinking approach to achieving it  and not just the solutions,btohqsg
This 100%. Until I went to uni I was very much a rote learner except for GP/Eng,btohqsg
Stress is  when you have kids to take care of and you realise the bank account doesn't have enough,btohqsg
I graduated into covid job market  thank god my degree is CS related,btohqsg
If not I might be like your friend jobless two years running,btohqsg
I told many students  when I was taking AL Physics  all I did as a summary and prep the day before the exam is to look through a 2 page formula sheet I created.,btohqsg
because the thinking has been trained before hand. I only needed to recap on the formulas.Skills take a long time to train. Concepts and formulas  half a day to a day will do.,btohqsg
the sooner students understand that  the sooner they will put in the effort at the correct spot to do the work.,btohqsg
You think those large language models will disrupt your ability to deliver lessons?,btohqsg
Like maybe you‚Äôd need to adapt your lessons to take advantage of these tools,btohqsg
two reasons1) I tried using ChatGPT to assist me in updating my notes for new syllabus for S3. It gave horribly wrong answers,btohqsg
it will still be a long time to be proper.Apart from that  even if it may be technically correct  it doesn't yet know how to hit the mark schemes that are needed,btohqsg
this i can relate... because still not google-able :P,btohqsg
it also doesn't have fixed systemised methods that can be used to solve questions. So it can lead to tons of confusion to the unguided,btohqsg
Fair enough  but if you have a resource like fully digitized papers and marking schemes  someone can train a variant of chatGPT which is very good at ‚ÄúA level Singapore physics‚Äù etc,btohqsg
2) Subjects like Physics are sometimes taught using demonstrations of real world stuff. Language models will never be able to achieve this.,btohqsg
I suppose it‚Äôs not complete elimination of the tutor but if you see potential for it to be a productivity enhancer or selling point,btohqsg
Language models are not able to bring in experiential learning. At best they can help to find videos that are publicly available and done by others  but not create any from scratch,btohqsg
so are u sayjng that im boring,btohqsg
Not at all lol  just that you‚Äôd either have to be signed on and bored,btohqsg
Or that‚Äôs your Gf who signed on,btohqsg
why do u text like a boomer,btohqsg
Getting the S4s to learn each A lvl topic within a 2 hr lesson is fun,btohqsg
Cause I have an old soul üòÇ,btohqsg
PUT THE PERSON FACE THE FLOOR AND DO CPR,btohqsg
@chemcergot one more medic like me in my bunk,btohqsg
Would you agree if I told you that specialized models or services which sell you the ability to create speciallized chat models (such as for answering A levels Physics questions in Singapore) will probably exist in 5 years  and help your existing tutors or yourself scale a business?From the educators standpoint  what‚Äôs the likelihood of this and what do you think the humans will specialize in?,btohqsg
Rly curious cause you‚Äôre a business owner and obviously good at math and physics,btohqsg
AI answering questions is definitely possible. Because if I can systemise my methods  computers will sure be able to.,btohqsg
The AI will also need the ability to comprehend and interpret graph questions as well.,btohqsg
This won‚Äôt be too big a challenge from my knowledge,btohqsg
So if it is solely language then no. Need to also have graphics.,btohqsg
yup that one not an issue.,btohqsg
I believe in that. But ChatGPT has no creativity moving forward. Anything that can digitise  ChatGPT can do it 100x better.,btohqsg
The conceptual and technical part sure can.But cannot motivate students.,btohqsg
There's enough materials available everywhere for conceptual and technical trainings  that even without AI  it is more than sufficient.,btohqsg
Soon we need tuition to teach those life skills like speaking in a motivational way  empathy  human connection  all the so called ‚Äúfluffier‚Äù skills  yeah,btohqsg
It will be more interesting if the AI can identify the weaknesses and hurdles to doing well  by analysing a student's exam paper,btohqsg
This actually was something I was considering doing before I found work in 2020,btohqsg
There‚Äôs already non AI analytics tools which need integration,btohqsg
