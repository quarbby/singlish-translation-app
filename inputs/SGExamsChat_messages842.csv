Heavy rain expected over many areas of Singapore from 14:40 hours to 15:40 hours. [Issued by NEA  14:15 hours],btohqsg
hiya  super sorry for the late reply - im looking at med and dentistry  psychology and sport science also looks really appealing to me,btohqsg
yeah  am aware that taking h1 math locks out quite a fair bit of options. but then again i don’t see myself working in sectors that require some of these courses,btohqsg
If you are looking at med and dentistry  then I assume your O lvl grades or Y4 grades would be good. And in that scenario  why even consider H1  and not start with 4 H2s?Yet if you do not have the confidence to start with 4 H2s  why would you have the confidence for med and dentistry? It doesn't make a lot of sense.For my 2011 student  it was because he didn't take A Maths  so he didn't qualify for H2 Maths. He had no choice. So unless you also didn't take A Maths... then maybe it makes sense.,btohqsg
Oh need amath for h2 dam,btohqsg
i see i see  then i think ill start off w 4h2 and see how from there,btohqsg
does anyone know anything ab IB,btohqsg
I chose nursing despite having options for low tier jc. Ended up regretting this decision. My friends told me poly was stress free and easier to enter med as nursing opens a door to doc ( this is untrue LOL ). Quite hard cos u have to score 3.7 to 4.0. Have to factor in bad teammates and getting your peer evaluation sabo by them. If I’m not wrong  fr a lvls  u need to have 85-90rp to enter nuts / ntu med. i think if u can manage the workload with h2  then u shld take h2 up.,btohqsg
I have heard some stuff about it,btohqsg
i wanna take it but like sm more resources ab jc a levels so im a bit lost man,btohqsg
I think if u hv the options  u shld take it,btohqsg
taught IB this yearpersonally find it more challenging overall for Physics  and also more challenging overall as a course compared to A level.,btohqsg
do you know if it would help for going overseas uni or something,btohqsg
no additional advantage vs A lvl,btohqsg
I think u can search the entry requirement of the course u r applying for in uni,btohqsg
nothing wrong. Each person has their own path.Then we look back 40 - 50 years later and laugh at our old self and act experienced to advise others 😂,btohqsg
but seriously no one will know where their paths bring them,btohqsg
I have met NUS engineering scholar quitting engineer after 1st yr and paying back the scholarship for not doing wellwent on to SMU under their scholarship instead (it was new that time  so gave out lots)Then doing very well in banking industry now,btohqsg
I would say H1 maths is ok. But just like what one of them said  H2 does give more options  esp for back up plans.Perhaps  you can try H2 Maths first  and then drop to H1 Maths as a plausible option? But if you rlly rlly struggle with Calculus or trigo portion  very badly to the extent A maths like barely passing(C5/C6)  I would recommend H1 Maths,btohqsg
Esp since H2 Maths assumes your A math knowledge is very good,btohqsg
But yea a plausible option wld be dealing h2 maths in first yr and then droppibg to 2nd yr,btohqsg
Or even 4 h2 but neglect the math one,btohqsg
Esp since they change the grading system,btohqsg
Oh btw some people in bcme stream also do struggle w econs as well,btohqsg
@LZW_1236th dead now2 Danish    1 American  1 Uk and 2 AustraliansAustralian parliament addressed the 4th death which was their first death from the methanol poisoning incident.The 6th death is another citizen,btohqsg
laos tourism bout go into the gutters,btohqsg
"before the myanmmar situation  it was the hub of illegal gambling and trafficking and was one core point in the infamous ""golden triangle of asia""",btohqsg
Imagine Macau  but less legal. That is LaosIt has as much tourist visitations as macau,btohqsg
yepyep  that’s the plan i’m going for so far  see how im doing by the end of y1 then decide accordingly,btohqsg
There are still 8 people in hospital  including a new zealander,btohqsg
not that we know ofIn aug  6 people also died in thailand for drinking tainted alcohol bought in diff placesorigin was traced to a supplier that did not know her product had its ethanol concentration replaced with methanol.,btohqsg
Not an IB Student  but this pretty sums up of it.ToK + EE is something like GP paper.So you will be having like 7 subjects that you need to cram through in 2 years?,btohqsg
But I guess there are less painful ways to get a Year 12/High School Diploma to enroll into University.,btohqsg
In Malaysia  nowadays SPM/O Level leavers opt. for Australian Year 12 syllabus (depending on which Australian Syllabus: HSC/WACE/SACE). Because of their easier assessments methods  and longer exam assessment time.Otherwise  Cambridge A-Level is more common  then EdExcel A-Level board.,btohqsg
IB Diploma is much of a rare  unless you get a sponsorship  and manage to cram through that much subjects within 2 years.,btohqsg
"Or if you a Malaysian Chinese Independent School folk  there is the UEC exams. Apparently that's a ""secret"" admission to NTU/NUS  if you did superbly well in CIS schools.",btohqsg
no  I taught cuz a friend asked for help.I saw a different world. And I saw many school prelims copied questions from IB papers into H2 Physics.,btohqsg
I see. Seems like 1-to-1 tutoring.,btohqsg
Different world  yes. It is easier to copy question from an Exam Board  rather than coming out questions yourself. 😂,btohqsg
I just find it annoying that IB Questions always have copyright issue and literally delete an entire question haha,btohqsg
yup. Physics up till A lvl is just too simple.,btohqsg
😂 well  to you. Not for every student. lol.,btohqsg
You will never say Physics is easy ever again 😈,btohqsg
first 2 semesters was ok. A+After that I never take liao.,btohqsg
Elec engineering that time has physics modules,btohqsg
The other day  saw my A-level Physics lecturer from my College (didn't taught me) posted on instagram  give himself anxiety marking his students answers. 🙈,btohqsg
as long it isn't Electromagnetism Module. 💀,btohqsg
My NUS tutor was asking me why choose elec engineering and not physics. I also don't know how to reply,btohqsg
"EEE - ""One Degree many Opportunities.""",btohqsg
ok leh. EE modules also A+Only died at Signals when Fourier Transform came in and I didn't study enough. So that one was B+ I think,btohqsg
He told me applied physics also a lot of jobs.But is he say  I also don't know what jobs there are.,btohqsg
🙈 pretty sure that was some Engineering Math Module.,btohqsg
Signals and Systems I guess still ok kot.,btohqsg
I wld say if Physics have EE module  technically skill ready,btohqsg
But honestly  it seemed more focused toward quantum,btohqsg
sadly all those Engineering Maths I learnt in Uni. I never applied in my semiconductor job 😢,btohqsg
tbh  if got a chance  I would just tell those planning to join EEE/EE to just go for CS lol,btohqsg
the most fun in uni wasn't studying elec engineering modules  but studying 3rd lang,btohqsg
Engineering doesn't seems lucrative in S.E.A.,btohqsg
"this is the so called ""tapao modules"" ?",btohqsg
well  most of my colleagues  eventually got tired with their slow salary growth. Eventually their side hustle is playing stocks lol,btohqsg
otherwise  is running some coffee beans roastery.,btohqsg
AI lucrative for the time being. But computer stuff goes in cycles.,btohqsg
I meant AI could reduce the amount of manpower needed,btohqsg
well  office desk work I guess.Those physical labour one hardly would reduce.,btohqsg
I not at the level yet to understand. Financially not the highest.,btohqsg
some ex classmates earning 30k to 60k monthly.,btohqsg
F&B I guess  hardest to tutup kedai. Unless their produce is crap. lol.,btohqsg
super minority btwbut these are smart people.studies still important regardless,btohqsg
In Malaysia  that would be either Insurance or Property Guru.,btohqsg
Least effort max results ig lol,btohqsg
Life starts with Lso does Lazythey go hand in hand 💪,btohqsg
My friend at age 26 owned a Mazda Miata  just by selling RM 900k houses... 🙈,btohqsg
could do more  but agreed  this kills.,btohqsg
I just bought new car  COE 103kafter that COE drops 😭,btohqsg
no choice  overall is still cheaper than grab for the num of people in the household,btohqsg
Can always buy a cheap house and car in Johor  and spend like a king there. 😂,btohqsg
your job should be flexible enough?,btohqsg
house need to me ≥1mRM  no?,btohqsg
car cannot drive into sg aso,btohqsg
that's cheap. Equal to 4rm BTO,btohqsg
more like build more traffic light to delay me,btohqsg
Foreigners tak tau current policy.But there are surplus of Johor houses for RM 300K I read recently.,btohqsg
tbf if I were to choose between a 4rm BTO and a Johor house  I wld choose the BTO just because it's in sg,btohqsg
I see my friend  that 60k monthly  post on FB his new Ferrarimachiam change car every 2 to 3 years,btohqsg
Nice chap who donates back to his alma mataamt he donated is really a lot,btohqsg
4 rm BTO can get govt rebates 😂,btohqsg
ah  depends on your needs lo. And your future jobs requires you to be where tbh.,btohqsg
if your job is remote  and flexible to be about  most of the time like those digital nomads  would be ended up in Bali. Working in a cafe  earning USD haha,btohqsg
or some low cost of living place.,btohqsg
happy that schools get funding lol.,btohqsg
if solo OK. Need to take care older family members then hard,btohqsg
malaysia  most of our high school is so run down 💀,btohqsg
pretty sure the desk I sat 10-20 years ago  still in use by some poor kiddo right now.,btohqsg
yeah. like this desk from 2004 lol,btohqsg
those plastic injected mold desks are wobbly  and the table surface is uneven  and literally breathing microplastics everyday... 💀,btohqsg
sadly Singapore BTO requirements are for married couples...?,btohqsg
Singles can apply for bto wat,btohqsg
2 rm onlyfor above 35 yrs old,btohqsg
singles have to rent or buy resale flats,btohqsg
my malaysian high school. just sad to see Malaysians hardly donate back to schools to refurb classrooms.,btohqsg
but then  I guess  because we also being taxed quite high also lol,btohqsg
but money doesn't seems to be properly spent on resources in the school,btohqsg
as long Singapore rooms doesn't skyrockets to $2k/room I'm totally ok,btohqsg
ah  Malaysians normally earning more than RM4k+/month  is being taxed like 1k-3k per year.,btohqsg
our tax brackets is also somewhat higher compared to Singapore's?,btohqsg
sg personal tax is rly low,btohqsg
food prices also $4-7 per meal is consider quite a big portion.,btohqsg
Malaysia I go order economy rice - so economical last time I ate from RM 5 (3 dishes) now RM 10+ (2 items) 💀,btohqsg
atleast Singapore's Hawker Centres I feel is properly ran lah .,btohqsg
hardly locals in Malaysia wanna do hawker centres,btohqsg
sg hawker scene propped up by the elderly,btohqsg
what do you meant by that?,btohqsg
Hello wyatt sir mr ex hall 7  what are the food options i can get outside of ntu now,btohqsg
Dont say extension im not going there,btohqsg
most sg hawkers are like older age group  and most of them either dh anyone to hand to  or don't recommend their kids to handover,btohqsg
means the elderly folks still in the F&B  no fresh blood want to do F&B?,btohqsg
The food court at pioneer mrt,btohqsg
might as well go Newton's ?,btohqsg
pay me enough money and I deliver ahlian for u,btohqsg
But legit pioneer mrt one food court 24 hrs,btohqsg
oh  thought you meant Singaporeans retirements folks normally loiter/kill time at Hawker centre talkok/blow water. haha,btohqsg
Why is google map telling me to take campus green to kimly coffeeshop,btohqsg
Green bus takes to pioneer mrt,btohqsg
quite convenient if you ask me for a 24 hour hawker cenre,btohqsg
Yeah thats if i have a car,btohqsg
need to walk 40 mins back to campus tho if Bus service ended haha,btohqsg
Which i technically could rent but i aint feeling like drivin,btohqsg
if you have an extra car at home  and a driving license. why not.,btohqsg
unless car rental parking is expensive in SG lol,btohqsg
The bus still operates after 12am?,btohqsg
nothing much went to food topic now.,btohqsg
Or i can download some shows,btohqsg
wait i was  ssupposed to finish watching that but like,btohqsg
The Netflix shows I see is always the plane accidents kind lol,btohqsg
Guy tries to save a restaurant basically,btohqsg
Sounds like a Gordon Ramsay plot,btohqsg
In a way  not reality show more of a actual drama?,btohqsg
My Netflix is yt  too many good vids on there,btohqsg
Next time you need show ask him for lobang,btohqsg
Peaky blinders too much space ugh,btohqsg
ladies and gentlemen...i present to you a runner for a smuggler,btohqsg

that's why don't smoke. once addicted  holiao  burn through all your savings,btohqsg
but damn the smugglers are getting brazen..put in such a obvious place lmfao,btohqsg

i think my original thought was how some mainstream news outlets are producing nothing much than what a hobbyist reporter will doidk why  but it feels so strange to be hearing anonymous reports through sources like sgfollowsall and other viral gossip social media paged,btohqsg

"i mean where are "" the states ... for their dirty linen"" ?",btohqsg
PUA is short for the term  pick-up artist which means being deceived  manipulated or brainwashed,btohqsg
there should be a comma or a period (full stop) between those two lines,btohqsg
...it's mainly the states. since europeans died down a lot after the monarchy reigns had been exposed for dirty linen,btohqsg
i mean  such stuff existed but wasn't publicized until social media's emergence,btohqsg

hallo im turning sec4 next yr and is there any tips / things i need to do before eae for poly next yr ? Im thinking of gg to game dev at tp / np,btohqsg
honestly i slacked throughout sec 3 & 4,btohqsg
did u get in thru eae? 😓,btohqsg
i feel like the only way i cn make it to the course iw is thru eae rn,btohqsg
Last min for o lvls is possible,btohqsg
i think there’s eae workshops held by np,btohqsg
u can ask during the open hse. we r having one soon,btohqsg
actually if you go through the eae process hor  it's much easier if you have a eae offer to youthe only downside is that you can't withdraw after the phase of accepting/rejecting the offer to you has ended  so you must be 100% sure that you're interestedespecially since the course you mentioned at both np + tp.. they have super limited slots available 😭😭,btohqsg
actually do u have past year P2s,btohqsg
Then elements of theme 1 in atmo,btohqsg
Maybe a flooding theme 1 actually,btohqsg
But drq is fr just data heavy,btohqsg
i saw ! its only 25 ppl so thats why im trying eae.. im not sure how the process will be like so that's why im asking 😓,btohqsg
if anyone got accept thru eae before pls help,btohqsg
2022 drq was just 100m of data analysis,btohqsg
3 schools  I got for cjc and jpjc but I went for ny interview,btohqsg
Ya u go see the paper again,btohqsg
All the chers said it's damn boring,btohqsg
cb why did I get nuked,btohqsg
why is it when I question whether is it fair,btohqsg
Mmm since it is the holidays  maybe you could try to buffen up the resume a little bit  maybe try like volunteering or doing some kind of coding project?(Idk how eae works....)But most important  your grades eventually has to be there for you to get the offer.,btohqsg
if u censorship is the way to go,btohqsg
I think this A not easy to get...,btohqsg

Your most recent messages weren't on-topic for the O-level chat  so they were removed,btohqsg
And as if ur response or either,btohqsg
So in this case if u count that as relevant,btohqsg
Then we go back to DBWB,btohqsg
Being smth that actl came out in the paper,btohqsg
What response are you talking about?,btohqsg
Or more so the said standards that admins opt to uphold,btohqsg
"from my experience  standardised questions for science can be inconsistent or unaligned with university level resources dethe student will need to check with his teachercase in point: Previously Moe school marked my nephew's probability answer as wrong when written in percentage. Researching into Cambridge pre uni they state Percentage is accepted  furthermore uni textbook probability answers have been written in percentages.Turns out it's a Sg MOE practise to disallow % in probability. No particular statement from textbooks too. I even spoke to the teacher and all they explain is ""its standardisation"". Their explanations had no link to math concepts lol",btohqsg
Set ur own pre conditions and now u can’t defend it ?,btohqsg
do I need to dig out ss from dbwb,btohqsg
Let me remind u it did come out for paper 1.,btohqsg
Then DBWB shud not have been nuked,btohqsg
And previously another admin did say,btohqsg
So why are admins differing in standards ?,btohqsg
Is this what sg exams chat upholds as admin ?,btohqsg
Lowkey the whole convo just wasn't relevant,btohqsg
Your conversation was not about the subject itself; it was a discussion about speculating what questions will come up in the exam,btohqsg
Ok and so how is marking standard relevant to the subject,btohqsg
Even this message isn't really relevant to any homework qn tbvh,btohqsg
That is irrelevant. The percentage in probability is a formatting issue while the question above is a factual question,btohqsg
Tell me how is this not relevant,btohqsg
Ok la u tell me I take fake a level Geog papers,btohqsg
The person who responded to V's message was also irrelevant,btohqsg
Marking is not the same as speculation  or is it?,btohqsg
Everything shud have just been nuked,btohqsg
Is it relevant to the subject given ur standards ?,btohqsg
How’s marking standards gonna solve ur question,btohqsg
What’s the relevance of marking to homework help,btohqsg
I don't get what your problem is  honestly,btohqsg
You're just trying to equate two completely different things,btohqsg
given V’s high and prestigious standards,btohqsg
u never offered a good explanation,btohqsg
On the topic and scale of relevance isn’t it the same,btohqsg
It’s not relevant to homework help,btohqsg
Tell me how is marking standards and whatever u stated in formatting issue relevant to homework help,btohqsg
I have never removed any messages on marking,btohqsg
yes and don’t u think that’s a problem in your double standards ?,btohqsg
Is it relevant in nature ?,btohqsg
I remove messages from other users too,btohqsg
You think I'm only targeting you and that is not the case,btohqsg
Tldr this chat only for answering practice qns that other ppl ask lol,btohqsg
I think the main thing is this tbf,btohqsg
Then what double standard are you talking about?,btohqsg
How does asking question this one from what jc,btohqsg
Do you expect me to be online 24/7?,btohqsg
it's more of a you problem in the sgexams study chatswhy do you only pick out a few handful messages from the same few people in those chats to nuke their messages? it's more of wanting to clarify what's your motive or thought process with rigidly handling moderation for community rules  because your so-called moderation isn't consistent all the time (when you're online and looking at the logs  chats etc),btohqsg
and are you not already 24/7 online nuking Geog,btohqsg
Why nuked mine immediately and this soon,btohqsg
u think what short term vs long term,btohqsg
There’s no criteria’s here for u to choose,btohqsg
If u can’t even make ur own standards balance,btohqsg
Then who tf r u to even nuke in the first place,btohqsg
I don't target specific users or messages.,btohqsg
right so we go back to DBWB ok,btohqsg
ok ah so personally as a moderator  stuff like this is okay  as long as it doesn't go off topic,btohqsg
but when it becomes stuff like this is when it's gets on the other side of the line,btohqsg
i wldnt call this relevant too,btohqsg
The original conversation was removed because it turned into an extended conversation about speculating exam questions. That's all that happened.,btohqsg
🤷🏻‍♀️ seems more like people made very inconsistent decisions and ended up salve the situation without trying to escalate or damage reputationbut it does an entirely opposite effect,btohqsg
it's not just a one-time thing alr ah,btohqsg
so what’s with the nuking when rand clarified what dbwb is,btohqsg
oh is today not another piece  of evidence ?,btohqsg
Like someone asked abt TMUA in the o level chat,btohqsg
@IcedMilois this the standards of sg exams admin?,btohqsg
Someone sends NON SG RELATED EXAM HELP,btohqsg
Even when other people like call them out for giving false info,btohqsg
the other admins have revealed chat moderation evidence and other members have made their stance either as victims or witnesses,btohqsg
PDF for u is it ?,btohqsg
we need to make this a,btohqsg
Whole pdf document issue is it,btohqsg
just a nicer way of saying things i guess,btohqsg
okay i think we can stop the argument here this really doesn't need to happen here,btohqsg
It just happened recently in the o level chat grp,btohqsg
i know we're handling this internally in the mod team,btohqsg
It’s never going to be settled,btohqsg
ok then V better come up with a,btohqsg
Well elaborated detailed answer w diagram if needed answer,btohqsg
And I refer you to this,btohqsg
todays o level and a level chat is an clear indication,btohqsg
ok uw play this game right,btohqsg
I will literally go through the whole chat and create a pdf,btohqsg
I never deleted anything in the A level chat today,btohqsg
I got all the time for this,btohqsg
Please just stop making vague accusations,btohqsg
"my favorite is still when mango got muted immediately for saying ""Haha"" once off but when other people were talking about olympiads and non a level related stuff they didnt get muted",btohqsg
My arguments are supported with clear evidence,btohqsg

Good Luck to those taking Principles Of Accounting Paper 2!,btohqsg
nvm my brain was not working 🥲🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
Hi guys I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this (admin can take down if it’s not😭)But did/is anyone taking ELL for A levels? Thinking of taking it next year but not much info out there!! If anyone can advice it’d be much appreciated 🙏,btohqsg
when she said HAHA once or smth,btohqsg
I already said  it's not once,btohqsg
while there was a whole ass argument going down between 5 people (me included) and none of us got muted,btohqsg

why tf did you delete it,btohqsg
could V be temporarily relieved of moderating in the O/N and A/IB/Poly chats for the time being or do something (like a time limited mute across sgexams platforms) about him for the time-being,btohqsg
"it's a question bank  just search for keywords ""integration"" ""differentiation"". And select the level you want to test yourself IGCSE/O-Level/A-Level(AS/A2).",btohqsg
"do know what international syllabus you want to test yourself  I am not aware the total differences between ""SG"" and ""international"" but mostly should be identical.",btohqsg
Then how come a few hours later other admins chimed in to say that your punishment was too strict,btohqsg
Cause it was a small deal,btohqsg
something to consider for the time being while yall discuss what actions to take about this@pen_guinii@memeline@IcedMilo@neildots@junghon3709@juuafterdark@caslynphang@Secrethaha,btohqsg
This happened multiple times too with this specific user,btohqsg
V needs to be reviewed by the owner,btohqsg
as i said earlier we'll discuss internally and we'll update again once we have come to a conclusion yea,btohqsg
So V if ur going by the book only for some occasions ur enforcement is very inconsistent,btohqsg
for now i think we can stop here  we hear you we'll look at it,btohqsg
A place to seek homework help for pre-U work and have serious studies-related discussions!,btohqsg
H2 Geography discussions should belong to serious studies-related discussions,btohqsg
hello friends  firstly I just want to apologise for all the frustrations that has been going on.I understand that the rules and guidelines that has been applied recently might not be consistent  and that has caused considerable unhappiness. since day 1  I have advocated for the telegram groups to be a conducive place to discuss anything that's on topic for the group  and I think the team have the same vision.when we moderate  we strive to be transparent  and as much as possible  consistent and objective. we're not perfect  but we'll try our best in the time that we're online. in view of this  the moderator team has been shuffled  and I hope that this will allow us to continue growing this group.additionally  I recognise that as the groups mature and evolve  it might be due time to properly review the rules and guidelines of our telegram groups  and I want to say that we will look at them soon once the team gets the chance to sit down together.in the meantime  good luck for the remaining examinations that you have  and please feel free to tag me or any of the other mods if there are any issues :),btohqsg
i mean the exciting portions were mostly just drama,btohqsg
Ngl  confused abt whatever just happened a few hrs ago but yes.,btohqsg
I feel like I missed a whole chapter cause I have not seen a major argument here for at least a month,btohqsg
This must be what doing finals exams feel like...,btohqsg
Hi Im wondering if there are any students from Temasek Polytechnic who have taken the Common ICT Program Also  Id like to know if there were any AutoCAD-related courses or learning materials included in the program My mom is pushing me to take AutoCAD courses before the semester starts so Im trying to find out more about whats available,btohqsg
common programmes typically don't dive too deep into industry specialized tools aside from stuff like adobe,btohqsg
Anyone here interested in participating in Microsoft Imagine Cup 25,btohqsg
I'm looking for another 2 members to join.Min age 18 or going to turn 18 next year,btohqsg
later i'll end up clogging the chat LOL,btohqsg
remind me to dm later because im having a rushed lunch and i have appt at 4pm ☠️,btohqsg
I wld be if I had any relevant skills LOL,btohqsg
be the backbone of the team and support the rest thru companionship⌗ jokes pls don't ever try to be an emotional counsellor for your friends  colleagues or teammates,btohqsg
I can only offer infra support :),btohqsg
actually  it feels more than enough,btohqsg
my sense of normalcy and logic isn't on the same wavelength as the majority,btohqsg
i take both pride and despair at that fact,btohqsg
an 18 year old girl fitting better with boomers instead,btohqsg
whenever i take the 16personality test every few years (because no way do i have the same patience to do more than 100+ questions every few months)this was the closest record of mine that i have managed to find but also quite old since it's 26th Nov 2024 but the report dated back on 18th Feb 2019,btohqsg
the lower deck seats are red & blue,btohqsg
i didn't snap a photo because there's a couple playfully bantering around at the last row seats,btohqsg
Nice  rarely take bus these days,btohqsg
im the opposite 😁i rarely take MRT,btohqsg
sry guys  MRT is usually a choice i avoid,btohqsg
even if the bus fare rates are burning more,btohqsg
i don't like mrt+ mrt station crowds as compared to bus,btohqsg
even during peak hours or holiday periods,btohqsg
istg even neighborhood bus routes are getting better treatment as compared to MRTs,btohqsg
I can't stand buses that have many stops,btohqsg
and also mrt that stops for longer time at every station like the East West Line,btohqsg
i prefer over that over mrts instead LOOLi usually just bring along a fully charged 60k mAh portable charger  wallet and phone for an entire day of bus rides (from punggol to yishun to bugis to sembawang/woodlands/jurong point back to home),btohqsg
if only buses do not stop at many and keeps moving,btohqsg
actually a lot of buses do that now,btohqsg
that's why there are people complaining more about buses not stopping to alight or pick-up passengers,btohqsg
there are many buses that stops at more than 30 bus stops,btohqsg
some public bus drivers might see something in the peripheral vision but they won't give a fuck  because they're already making a turn into the main road even if you flagged,btohqsg
if you take the off-peak buses or arrive at the bus stop late trying to rush for a bus that's about to drive away.. gg,btohqsg
there's always different scenarios  so nothing's definitely set in stone,btohqsg
"some of these same drivers blame in a lecturing tone to the passengers of not flagging ""noticeable"" enough",btohqsg
LOOOL i bought it off tiktok shop some time after my birthday because 10k & 20k mah power banks are not enough for me (one person) to get through an entire day,btohqsg
too lazy to find sockets now,btohqsg
i have never heard of any powerbanks over 30k LOL omg,btohqsg
i used to bring like 2-3 laptops  2 phones  two power banks  at least 3 pairs of earpieces both wired and wireless as well as some stationary  out during my sec 4 days for some reason,btohqsg
some ppl buy those during BMT,btohqsg
i wanted a 70k mah one but i either couldn't find that shit or it was out of my budget,btohqsg
most expensive backpack in the library,btohqsg
at one point  i carried one backpack and one handcarry,btohqsg
Imagine if your bag got searched for being suspicious last time,btohqsg
my parents always called me some rich woman for being so unnecessary,btohqsg
nah  didn't happen once at all,btohqsg
not even when i brought like scissors and sharp objects that would count as weapons,btohqsg
im more concerned how you carried all that weight,btohqsg
i suffer from back pain now,btohqsg
i used a tote bag for my stuff and after half a year it felt like my shoulders were not aligned,btohqsg
my parents used to complain about why my primary + secondary school backpacks (mostly pri) weighed like a bomb aka heavier than 5kg,btohqsg
LOL i think is quite normal thoo,btohqsg
that one chem tb already 2kg,btohqsg
i estimate it 5kg and asked my parents if my estimation was accurate and they said no,btohqsg
my face was like speechlessly crestfallen,btohqsg
I TOLD THEM I REMOVED SHIT ALREADY,btohqsg
tolerable  but my back screams either aching or outright pain like i stretched too much muscle,btohqsg
this happens even if i end up standing for far too long in one day  and multiple times a week,btohqsg
my parents said just to rub some ointment or paste salompas,btohqsg
i dont think salonpas does anything for that..,btohqsg
back in 2017:my posture was already this bad..,btohqsg
so i just sniff medication oil until my dad says i resemble some substance addict  and even worse than an elderly,btohqsg
medicated oil is a must have tbh 🔥🔥,btohqsg
fun fact: i carry at least one yu yee (old version) oil  war axe oil  or vix roller inhaler,btohqsg
LOOL honestly yeah  i shouldmy physical fitness and lifestyle habits make my life more miserable despite me wanting to be a normal living human,btohqsg
why i say normal living human is because im nearly a shut-in recluse hikikomori,btohqsg
there was one point (late october this year to middle november) where i barely talked to people and just drowned in romance novels/dramas,btohqsg
i tell myself it's okay but no  it's not okayim just deluding myself into getting my trululu,btohqsg
no  im on term break with MC,btohqsg
but those olden sam sui women probably carried more heavier stuff on their shoulders for construction,btohqsg
social studies and poa textbook + subject ring files,btohqsg
okay now that you've explained in detail  maybe not so impossible,btohqsg
i can't even lift my first younger brother's sec 4 bag anymore,btohqsg
thankfully he just needs to collect his results LOL,btohqsg
dates haven't related yet whatso  tentative dates for N(T) & N(A) results are 16-18 Dec roughly around there this year,btohqsg
should be about the same every year,btohqsg
no plans to go sec 5?,btohqsg
he says he die die refuses to go sec 5,btohqsg
he's not confident he can go poly,btohqsg
he flunked studying for N levels,btohqsg
iirc it was his girlfriend usually pushing (motivating) him to study together at somewhere at like a library or their school,btohqsg
his prelim ELMAB3 was like 17-18 raw,btohqsg
i calculated for him based on his report slip and said it was 17 points and he said after calculating himself that it was 18,btohqsg
Omg a level is finally over,btohqsg
since it's over we shall temporarily close the A level chat  no further discussion required,btohqsg
9744 and 9749 should be H2 others no idea,btohqsg
I thoight h1 econs over alr,btohqsg
has anyone ever responded or went down to check for any of these alerts,btohqsg
yeah  don’t go unless you’re trained to do so tbh (and confident to deal w the emergency),btohqsg
the only reason i downloaded was for the casual police report feature they have on their app,btohqsg
I have 1 bitcoin who wants half,btohqsg
no way am i going to spf website or some video tell machine (VTM) at a neighborhood police office just to make a police report,btohqsg
how do u even 0.5 of one bitcoin,btohqsg
man this is where my love-hate relationship with industry specialisations come in,btohqsg
i know  im just trying to entertain myself,btohqsg
i hope my fever cooling patch doesn't end up solid frozen in the freezer because i want to get it into *cold temperature through express mode,btohqsg
Sell the bitcoin n split the money,btohqsg
if you only have a single $1 coin  how do you split half of it ( im being logically dumb cause memeline already clarified ),btohqsg
go kopitiam ask for 2 50¢ coin,btohqsg
EH I TRIED THIS METHOD B4 (asking shops for a small money change)........they'll either1) shoo me away2) ask me to buy something first /3) ask for a bigger (or even more smaller) change money which i probably don't have4) call for their manager who will reject me 🤠😭☠️,btohqsg
the only reason why I kena reject before is cause they dw big coins/notes,btohqsg
otherwise they've alw been v willing to change,btohqsg
i heard shops in different down town areas have drastic services from what ppl might have personally experienced,btohqsg
i asked for a small change from $10  some stall asked if i had $50 instead otherwise they won't change,btohqsg
West side been good to me,btohqsg
i even went to a cinema (but that's on me ngl) and those lelong shops to exchange small money changes and they always had some weird requirement or excuse to reject me??,btohqsg
ok to be fair.. i usually frequent the opposite side,btohqsg
west side has pretty good retail service but you'll need to dig deeper,btohqsg
i frequent a lot of northeast  east and central (downtown city) areaslike punggol  sengkang  buangkok  hougang  kovan  serangoon  ang mo kio  tampines  pasir ris  paya lebar  bugis  orchard  marina etc,btohqsg
it's always a hit-or-miss situation  even with repeated patronization,btohqsg
rlly ? they gave me the change even tho i didn’t buy smthg,btohqsg
different town area / shops got different retail service,btohqsg
some shops are p nice but others.. not so much,btohqsg
Have you used Google pus before,btohqsg
i rmbr that service ceased operations,btohqsg
responded to a few cardiac cases  never really got one for fire tbh,btohqsg
did you do any training to respond to alert cases near you? idk if an individual-- die die needs the qualification before they can help but im pretty confident with basic first aid learnt from classes and UG,btohqsg
i think a certification is good to have  rather than a must have for this types of things,btohqsg
ohh  that's pretty useful to know! thanks 🙏,btohqsg
personally i have a standard first aid + cpraed cert from red cross but i don’t recall any instances where i had to show it while responding,btohqsg
with an interesting way to take a picture of questions,btohqsg
i would have never bothered to look carefully at profiles if no one says something AGGGHH,btohqsg
like who in the right minds puts sex related images (aside from memes and art) in their profiles,btohqsg
this snapshot exam paper of questions....,btohqsg
idk whether to laugh at the english formatting of the questions or cry at it,btohqsg
the horror of peeking into someone's profile because usually it's either thinking someone's profile is pretty rad with the aesthetics or that they're cool after talking with them-- so you wanna check them out right?flashed by a ( nehneh / t*t  kkj  cb or some weird fetish shit ) picture somewhere in their profile images that's set to public for some reason..,btohqsg
curse from the curiosity of the cat,btohqsg
it's time to become the next bedok,btohqsg
answer is B C B C ?,btohqsg
and they put all of them as options 🥲,btohqsg
the questions are too weirdly set and out-of-context,btohqsg
doesn't seem like a science or english test but some random generalised MCQ theory paper with poor english,btohqsg
i would rather shave my head bald than to believe that's actually a sg exam paper,btohqsg
I dont think it is even an sg a level exam paper,btohqsg
thankful that it's not my paranoia / over-imagination acting up,btohqsg
"imma wait for any tuition to release their physics mcq ans key tmr and see if I guess ""B"" for all qns  how many I'll get right",btohqsg
Sorry for the late tag but you are not catfishing right?,btohqsg
replying in business days be like,btohqsg
I don't even check this channel often just nice saw the unread messages on top lol,btohqsg
what was the number of unread messages you have here,btohqsg
my peak was not opening O/N Level study chat until i had over 10k messages unread from muting the gc,btohqsg
it's probably around 11 or 12k now,btohqsg
this is peak zero social life,btohqsg
Of course at ungodly hrs the most random message will catch your eye,btohqsg
Mine is peak zero social life,btohqsg
Were you here when I asked if fish had legs,btohqsg
i think so  but i was always a lurker,btohqsg
chinese mermaids be like : 美人鱼 !!even for males..,btohqsg
Maybe it was in another discord,btohqsg
Btw unity  that discord channel is so ded,btohqsg
sg discord hangout server communities are more or less dead,btohqsg
Oh wait no octopi are crustaceans 😂,btohqsg
True...everything back to their usual lives,btohqsg
so i have to rely on random ppl that dm me,btohqsg
i tend to ghost ppl im not very familiar with  who dm me,btohqsg
Oh yea btw did you delete my old DMS lol  that acc is gone,btohqsg
your old account was hacked and gone,btohqsg
Prob send like a dozen emails to retrieve that old accs,btohqsg
"Can imagine people with the DMS of someone whom acc is ""deleted account"" lmfao",btohqsg
i can't even see the profile of your deleted account,btohqsg
you won't be able to reply to the dms chat*,btohqsg
Well it's deleted..I guess  I self destroyed it after that kid hacked and spent $5 on my acc,btohqsg
unless i scroll down until my chats from july-aug,btohqsg
Hey had tele premium while it lasted..was fun I guess,btohqsg
i joined the dark side of tele premium,btohqsg
There's prob a keyword like ticket cause of the ndp thing,btohqsg
Didn't I dm you for that ndp ticket,btohqsg
i don't recall privately messaging you about ndp tickets,btohqsg
wasn't it only LP and some girl,btohqsg
Oh wait nvm I told my friend to dm you  I'm guessing he never did,btohqsg
or was it me that did so,btohqsg
cause we didn't have the dates we want,btohqsg
Prob the first cause idk if I even gave you his contacts,btohqsg
i think you just provided me his tele user,btohqsg
Yea or I provided him with yours,btohqsg
probably both scenarios  i think i was the one that messaged him though,btohqsg
Whatsapp is cooked cause wtf is that pic,btohqsg
I have my picture set to show me all pics people sent in WhatsApp...this feature is cooked,btohqsg
U a car guy? or bus guy,btohqsg
dont laugh ok i no friends,btohqsg
But not super indepth  I don't know much about engines or interiors...etc,btohqsg
Ahhh same here. Only interested in exterior shit,btohqsg
i have been reading too much BL fulfilling my motherly/auntie fujoshi heart,btohqsg
Tf why is that ur first response bruh,btohqsg
Yea and because of WhatsApp  I get to see pics like this in sg,btohqsg
There's a group of Car enthusiasts that also spots cars like these,btohqsg
Man I used to take random pics of exotic cars on the street I happen to pass by. Until I ran out of storage on my phone,btohqsg
normalize being wild in asking questions,btohqsg
How many exotics have you seen just walking on the street,btohqsg
I'm too lazy to actually go to all the cars meets,btohqsg
I was walking arnd after gg for a run then I walked into a car park and saw that,btohqsg
So I spot regular but unique cars like these regularly,btohqsg
Here's a not as rare one,btohqsg
I know there are also a few car enthusiast here but they lurking,btohqsg
Btw I need your help in identifying a car,btohqsg
That car looks like a lancia imo,btohqsg
Yea that's what others been saying cause of the tailights but wonder which model,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll look more into it after my exam tmr,btohqsg
