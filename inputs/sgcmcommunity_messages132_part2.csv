And u buy used car that left 6 months every 6 months?,btohqsg
Not everyone can do like u,btohqsg
Ur reason of buying cars to earn profit is for Grab. But not everyone here buy for Grab. Some buy for family or for other reason. So earlier on  it's not correct for u to say that car  in general  can earn u profit. Its quite misleading becos ur profit only applies to u only.,btohqsg
Where got everyday have $60 trip,btohqsg

But Sgcarmart must tied down with the car dealer then can benefit the interested buyers.,btohqsg
Actually you can just apply for the loan and bring it to your used car dealer - J,btohqsg
We helping dealers clear their inventory - J,btohqsg
no leh some dealers dont l et me take own loan,btohqsg
true! you can check out our used car listings from time to time. there are some dealers who are onboard with this new loan initiative already,btohqsg
Ya dealers insist we take their loan don't allow us take your loan leh,btohqsg
Who are the dealers so we can see their inventory,btohqsg
Probably doesn’t work for COE cars,btohqsg
i'm waiting for the reply - J,btohqsg
You ah don’t work for COE cars,btohqsg
nope cannot full loan must be min 30% down,btohqsg
correct. PARF cars only for now,btohqsg
there is no pro smart loan dealer  we will curate a list of cars inside sgcarmart to help the dealer to convert sales using our smart loan  for those who cannot find the CTA  they can contact our smart loan hotline directly and apply with our staff.,btohqsg
you will see this button on a used car listing,btohqsg

Not available for new car ?,btohqsg
haven sell my current car yet  next dealer unknown,btohqsg
Most dealer I spoke too said they don't partner or accept sgcarmart loan becos they don't receive commission. They prefer we consumer takes loan from banks or in house and some more longer loan terms. It seems that consumer isn't king when comes to buying car.,btohqsg
We have play by the dealer's book,btohqsg
Experience a recent case where I told a dealer I wasn't interested in taking a more than 50% loan amount and 5 years tenure  within 10 seconds he immediately said the car is sold.,btohqsg
lmao just let him rot with the car,btohqsg
Until today the car is still listed. I don't want to name the dealer but it has a local celebrity as their brand ambassador. U can figure yourself but I will definitely avoid such dealer,btohqsg
To be Frank  owning a car is already so expensive and stress  they still want to come up this kind of pattern.,btohqsg
that's why some ppl they take the loan,btohqsg
1 month ltr pay it off,btohqsg
pay extra 2k just so we cover ur loan commission when we wanna do full cash,btohqsg
He didn’t name Toh. He named San Hup Been,btohqsg
If i receive a complain  i'll have to delete this yeah? - J,btohqsg

I generally don't like to delete people's msgs (unless your name starts with P and rhymes with meet),btohqsg
J U TOLD ME DONT TOXIC,btohqsg
