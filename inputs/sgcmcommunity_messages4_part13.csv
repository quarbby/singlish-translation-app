Not all. Check with sc when they can deliver by,btohqsg
Some delay  as well as missing parts,btohqsg
ya you should. Highly recommend. They just launched their standard range version  but ya  i need more real life reviews to decide in future if the range is suitable. it’s about 340km actuallly.,btohqsg
For a big car like Polestar2 340km abit cui lea i feel,btohqsg
Nissan Leaf maybe a better choice,btohqsg
If you don’t have a dedicated charger   do take note of charging facilities for your car brand,btohqsg
That is around your work or home,btohqsg
I am wondering  do the chargers in our shopping malls compatible with all brands of EV?,btohqsg
so far the nearest i found near my home is a DC and AC but only 2 by SP Group,btohqsg
not too far  but too little.,btohqsg
yes it’s a bit low  they have the long range one with a bigger battery  but is 20k more expensive,btohqsg
Yes except for tesla charger that they have like in 5 malls for now,btohqsg
Range is important in ev like we can do a single charge drive to to kl,btohqsg
well ya a lot of things to consider in future. but i’m personally convinced that EV is the way to go.,btohqsg
Difference between ice and ev is that the bigger the engine the higher the fc is and that is your trade off   for ev is the smaller you it battery   the shorter the range and that is your trade off,btohqsg
I seen ppl trying to charge Thier ev at tesla charger before,btohqsg
Anyone Tried or drove Nissan Note E power? On  Full Tank can go how much Distance?,btohqsg
I agree too. But battery manufacturers have to be innovative and not rely on nickel  lithium and cobalt in the future. These minerals do not last forever.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend workshop to replace airbag ecu. Kanna airbag error.Car Model golf 1.4 mk7 (2014),btohqsg
CarCreed  if you’re staying in the east. Used to bring my ex-golf there,btohqsg
Of course no   they spent so much money building charging station is to monopolize market,btohqsg
Any workshop good and reasonable  for car oil servicing package,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend a good car servicing ard Pioneer or Soon Lee area?Thanks...,btohqsg
Yes but cannot drive in sg unless u get approval from LTA,btohqsg
you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR,btohqsg
but anyone can buy a malaysian car to driver in malaysia,btohqsg
Haha joke:) cos your nick is X and u showed a mark X … just a joke ok.. no offense,btohqsg
oh i see. haha what a coincidence,btohqsg
japan culture i hear that commands highest respect,btohqsg
Yes this true…. But I heard some pple have work permits in Malaysia and can get “approval” …. I got fined before for driving a Malaysia 🇲🇾 registered car 3 decades ago… $800,btohqsg
Yes very good car…. First cousin of IS250,btohqsg
Don't know whether anyone else caught on to that reference,btohqsg
nope this is incorrect. I personally know a singaporean living in msia (he has business there) who is approved via letter from LTA to drive a malaysian car in singapore,btohqsg
he is singapore citizen born and raised  and is not even malaysian PR,btohqsg
That’s special situation. Did you ask why he got LTA letter? Try getting one yourself and see if you get it,btohqsg
you said it was impossible. im just saying its not impossible. and he got the letter because he spends 99% of his time in msia and therefore does not need to buy a singapore car. he wrote a letter to LTA and with a few supporting documents  they approved him. anything else?,btohqsg
That’s special situation. He spends abs does business in Malaysia. And with written permission this is outlier.,btohqsg
what you just said is inconsistent with your earlier statement,btohqsg
i am pointing out your earlier statement is factually incorrect. There was no mention of special circumstances,btohqsg
I have friends who spend a lot of time in Malaysia  owning Malaysia car but cannot drive to singapore. He’s to park the car in malaysia and then take a bus to singapore,btohqsg
yes this applies to most people who own property in msia but work or spend significant time in singapore,btohqsg
Geez you’re pointing to technicality here. So my statement doesn’t not preclude special conditions like disabled car ownership which they may allow. You don’t have to be so exact. There are many Singaporeans who live in Malaysia and commute daily to singapore. They absolutely cannot use malaysian car to get in and out,btohqsg
er...i am just taking your words as they are. i think most people want to be taken literally. if i choose to interpret your words suka suka  undesirable outcomes can result,btohqsg
This sinkie friend spends 2 years or more in Malaysia. Yet he cannot drive his malaysian car in singapore.,btohqsg
He likes Malaysia. But doesn’t mind,btohqsg
so if you want to say singaporeans absolutely cannot drive msian cars in singapore  that is a clear statement with clear meaning. perhaps i can suggest being more clear in your wording next time. just saying,btohqsg
You’re being technical here. Outliers are special circumstances not counted. What counts is majority for people like you and me.,btohqsg
i think in future you should add this to your original statement then>>> you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR,btohqsg
I’ve lots of sinkies living in Jb. They buy malaysian cars. But can’t drive back.,btohqsg
i happily would agree with that,btohqsg
