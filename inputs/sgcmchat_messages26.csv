If theres nth wrong wif ite,btohqsg
Ok let‚Äôs say you have a poly graduate and an ITE graduate ppl wld most probably hire the poly guy,btohqsg
Now most ppl go for work experience,btohqsg

U need dog or not? I can bark for u,btohqsg
btw it wasnt meant to be a discrimination  i was saying team sp because i was js encouraging people to go to the same poly as me thats it. Sorry if it came off as stereotyping or offensive but it was never my intention maam,btohqsg
and yes i know many whom have grad from ite earning 6 figures a month. Mad respect,btohqsg
but im not mad because u said this because i understand u may have felt offended by what i had said,btohqsg
what im mad at was this because which part of the convo involved u bro? and who are u to comment on others appearance if ure so insecure to even put a photo of urself as ur pfp. Please lah  grow up,btohqsg
dont u understand that sometimes the things you say can rlly ruin peoples mood?,btohqsg
Im not even tryna square up or anyth with u  im js telling u nicely now to think before u send stuff,btohqsg
u realise im not even insulting u or anyth  im literally js saying it as a decent human being to another,btohqsg
but im not here to lecture u thru some chat. Choose ur own words tbh. im not gonna be ur mom or dad rn. Just learn how to at least have some manners in the things u type if ure unsure of what someone is even saying in the beginning,btohqsg
im not here to pick a fight or anyth. Im literally here to clarify what i said and to apologise if it sounded insulting to anyone but i left to cool down so i could pick my words out.,btohqsg
its not the first time things like this have been said in the chat. tbf its not healthy for anyone here. We literally all joined the chat because we have a similar passion. I dont see any fun in putting anyone down,btohqsg
soSoraim sorry if i was offensive can we put this behind us?,btohqsg
im not those type who want to pick fights and stuff over spilled milk i rather solve something and get on with life asap,btohqsg
Its aight yea was offended but i see where ure cmg from.,btohqsg

most car meets are open to everyone,btohqsg
Last time I went to the SgRetro when I was 17 I think. So should have no problems ah.,btohqsg
But as we get older we shift between bikes and cars. Like nowadays I tend to go motorcycle rides. Like the one Hari Raya Geylang ride thruüòÖ,btohqsg
I just have a bike but I can't wait to be 18 to be able to get a motorbike and a car,btohqsg

I notice totally different than motorcycle meets  S4 group we let Mark from tri333ple and his buddy join our grp in the charity ride the other time with DPM.,btohqsg
From a bike & car person pov. Bike meet up are generally more open to other kinds and genre of bikes.Whereas cars are more prone to 'categorising'. Eg  Honda day  Retro day etc.Bikes have things like motojambori  tons of charity ride. All kinda bikes just come tgt for the event.,btohqsg
Probably bcos cars take up much more space and can't accommodate that many vehicle at one venue. Or the people are just ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,btohqsg
alhamdulillah may Allah S.W.T bless the Prophet Peace Be Upon HIm,btohqsg
brooo bike events can see 2b kapcai all the way u till s1kr,btohqsg
no one cares about what bike u ride,btohqsg
u got bike means can join they very welcoming and friendly,btohqsg
