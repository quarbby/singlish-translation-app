Then dont put under motorcycle job.,btohqsg
Tampines mall where can park n run in get delivery???,btohqsg
We car and bike is the lala part lahVan and lorry is the moveðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Exactly. I think alot of them just abuse. Some car drivers jus take and do.,btohqsg
Stand for your own rights.  Don't let others take advantage. If you want to be abused go do gj or grab. They can abuse you with 5-10km pickup then client cancel.If you think and know what the client book is not in line with the job. Just walk/drive  away please. Humans must have dignity.,btohqsg
YupEspecially foodJust tell than will take 30min call cso to cancelThink they more gan jiong than us,btohqsg
Totally agree with you... So disgusted to see how these business owners try exploiting delivery personnel..,btohqsg
I drive a van coming to a year. They texted me today if I still have the sticker ( have removed the sticker somewhere November last year)  when I replied no  they straightaway suspend my account and ask me go paste. At the same time  the amount I withdrew yesterday was cancelled ...wtF!!! Seriously???,btohqsg
After a while I just can't be fucked. Say what cannot stack or whatsoever. If their food so important they would have it ready on time. Book bike but expect car.Ban or penalized $4 I don't care. Not like lala is the only food platform. Not like they are giving tips for it.,btohqsg
Oh dear  how can they force u to paste sticker? Too much..,btohqsg
Ya they are too much. Angry,btohqsg
Llm fuck up one. They want die dir want u to paste means its a must,btohqsg
But when I sign last year I rmb them saying must paste for a minimum 6 months ..no one says about must paste there for good,btohqsg
Yes 6mths is the contract. My neighbour just had his removed too,btohqsg
Aiyah they like to change their terms and conditions. Last year they ban me dunno how many times then perm ban me. I requested to return deposit. Called me back say will process etc after 10 days or so.  After a few days unban me and I still can take jobs.It's really not like they are the only unique ones. Ban me then I go other platform loh. I earn more on lala meh? Ban me I go drive gj. It's fine. Not like lala so good that I can't live without them.Now diesel so ex I got no trips nearby I go back home. Not going to wait a few hours till 5-6pm just so I can earn 10-20dollars. I rather rest.,btohqsg
Lalamove smart ask you paste sticker because once you have sticker you cannot join GOGOX,btohqsg
GOGOX policy is if your found with competitors logo immediately banned,btohqsg
Lalavan can really make money if you know how to drive.,btohqsg
