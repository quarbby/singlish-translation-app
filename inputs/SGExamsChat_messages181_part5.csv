Yea heard like it was 1/3 of the cohort last time,btohqsg
One of my GP Chers and one of my FM Chers took it,btohqsg
To go into pure mathematics  it is a different thing altogether. You can do terribly at school mathematics and end up excelling in pure abstract mathematics.,btohqsg
Meanwhile my other FM cher is 2006 J1 so he first batch of H1 H2 and H3,btohqsg
One of my maths teachers in the past was born in '88  so the 2006 graduating cohort,btohqsg
Funny thing is this FM cher he PW deputy head but got C for PW,btohqsg
But tbf first PW batch so the marking maybe quite whack,btohqsg
At the time the new system was quite messy and people didn't know what to expect,btohqsg
Yeah  I was already attending school at the time,btohqsg
Cant imagine how itâ€™s like to go research in 2006,btohqsg
Coz nowadays itâ€™s a lot of online research,btohqsg
Well  mostly from books. The internet was nonsense and most of my classmates did not have a computer at home,btohqsg
Then how did u write the WR lol,btohqsg
I mean I was in primary school at the time,btohqsg
Nowadays u have google drive for ur teachers to feedback fast,btohqsg
My family's desktop at home took 10 over minutes to start up,btohqsg
It came at a stupid timing,btohqsg
That will be in 2027  when MF26 runs out,btohqsg
But when I did PW we frequented the library to do work,btohqsg
Luckily now have google drive can do all at home,btohqsg
How are you so sure it would be exactly 2027?,btohqsg
There was google drive  but google docs is so lousy,btohqsg
Coz the old MF was MF15,btohqsg
26 stands for â€˜valid until 2026â€™,btohqsg
Oh MF15 was valid until 2016.,btohqsg
Coz the old MF which was MF15 was valid until 2016 exam,btohqsg
Just a theory but seems logical to me,btohqsg
Meanwhile the CIE one is MF19 which represents it start at 2019 Y1,btohqsg
Yea but u dun even use half the shit in MF26,btohqsg
Fucking funny sia half the pages are like for FM,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok just memorise/familiarise with MF26 I dun like to waste my time referring everytime,btohqsg
This is when it gets scary,btohqsg
We didnâ€™t even do partial derivative yet ahaha,btohqsg
This is my assignment in undergraduate mathematics.Partial derivatives are super easy. Just let all other variables be constants then differentiate. Complex analysis is not easy. Even with double and triple  integrals when you only consider the reals you often have to change your coordinates because the region you are considering is on a sphere or a cylinder,btohqsg
Implicit differentiation is actually harder than doing partial differentiation.When you evaluate a double or triple integrals you also treat everything else as constant then integrate,btohqsg
Well  as I said  not my cup of tea.,btohqsg
Maybe I gonna be calculus master,btohqsg
I prefer group and graph theory. The proofs for graph theory are a bit weird when you first look at it but once you get used to it  it's quite normal.The issue with calculus and analysis is that I find it is very arbitrary -- and they do use this exact word frequently.,btohqsg
One of the interesting theorems in graph theory:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratowski's_theorem,btohqsg
Analysis uses a lot of approximation,btohqsg
That's what makes it my worse nightmare,btohqsg
Shouldn't it be approximation uses a lot of analysis?,btohqsg
I guess it depends on what is meant by â€˜approximationâ€™,btohqsg
If itâ€™s approximation as in numerical methods  Iâ€™d agree,btohqsg
What I meant was approximation like  eg with some epsilon delta proofs for a given epsilon  we can choose a lot of deltas  as opposed to there being a single perfect delta,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” i guess i get what you mean (but ðŸ˜¬...),btohqsg
Sounds like taking a large samples of deltas,btohqsg
The epsilon Delta definition states that for all epsilon >0  THERE EXISTS delta such that...,btohqsg
Delta does not need to be unique,btohqsg
If you don't know  this is the definition of a limit,btohqsg
