anyone here appealed for ntu change of programme?,btohqsg
I'm still waiting for my appeal result,btohqsg
Exp outweighs academics in long run. U can gain more experience when ure younger. Uni anytime can go de,btohqsg
My suss application hasnt gotten back to me,btohqsg
Guys if a girl buys for you a $100+ office blouse (like g2k) as ur bday gift will u accept? ( ps. You only know the gift after you open),btohqsg
Cuz I'm rly scared my friend will turn down the gift,btohqsg
i feel like theres a lot of missing context,btohqsg
So we got an age gap of 8yrs,btohqsg
imo i think it’s okay? personally will accept but will probably “return the favour” with a meal or a good gift in the future also,btohqsg
but also if y’all are that close,btohqsg
ever considered spending less and maybe accompanying the gift w some handmade stuff or smth,btohqsg
okay idk what kind of gifts does he like,btohqsg
100+ was the lowest I got for someone as a bday gift tho,btohqsg
Shirt cuz his shirt was exploding HAHA,btohqsg
okay la then i think that’s good,btohqsg
maybe he like it that way🥴,btohqsg
That's why I tot he Hinting to get clothes :'),btohqsg
But IDK HIS SIZE SO HAHAHAH,btohqsg
All he said was Uniqlo size M,btohqsg
LATER END UP HELLA TIGHT AGN,btohqsg
Cuz I asked him why ur size shirt so tight,btohqsg
Then I ask Uniqlo staff size M is how big,btohqsg
He shorter than me by +1/-1,btohqsg
uniqlo M too short fr me,btohqsg
but depends on his build tho,btohqsg
later M also end up too tight,btohqsg
Uniqlo girls cutting too small for me,btohqsg
i think i need go get from toddlers section haiz,btohqsg
i thought he muscle fit eh,btohqsg
but i didn’t want to make any conclusion,btohqsg
I mean he dance and he is fit asf,btohqsg
Also I don't know what kind of packaging to give him??,btohqsg
I only got ntuc plastic rn,btohqsg
you buy a $100+ gift and put it in ntuc plastic,btohqsg
Ltr he will think it's a cheap gift,btohqsg
Then he won't kill me for the ex gift,btohqsg
I only do that if I know the person's age,btohqsg
I'll be that one basket friend that wrap around many times,btohqsg
I hope he doesn't kill me ltr when I meet him,btohqsg
Tho I will tell him slowly open,btohqsg
Cuz I wan the plastic bag,btohqsg
6 mins till I meet him LOL,btohqsg
you proposing to him or smth,btohqsg
eh but now covid yall take care pls,btohqsg
You're buying a guy a $100 office shirt? He's going to like it mostly,btohqsg
A little much imho but if hes your good friend then go for it,btohqsg
Keep the receipt in case it doesnt fit  he can get an exchange,btohqsg
guys.. any tips on how i can stop feeling tired/feverish in the morning to study?like i tend to feel feverish especially in the morning,btohqsg
Sleep early or just don’t study in the morning,btohqsg
is slp rly the only issue ;-;,btohqsg
cannot focus fr shit in the afternoon for some reason,btohqsg
unless right just sleep early wake up early get ur stuff done and you’re free the entire day,btohqsg
Just self psycho. If i dont this do now  i wont watch drama or sth else,btohqsg
Everyone is different. Just gotta find sth that works.,btohqsg
Maybe write out a to do list?,btohqsg
Sleep early  have something to eat before you start to study and take adequate breaks,btohqsg
Or you'll definitely burn yourself out,btohqsg
no point trying to force yourself,btohqsg
Does anyone know when the Chinese olevel start?,btohqsg
never worked for me at least,btohqsg
i think some tailors offer less than 100  why not get him a shirt from one of there so he can go thr get it fitted himself / pick colour deisgn wtv,btohqsg

it's ok bro just drop to clb if you fail,btohqsg
U put ur details in confirm get scam,btohqsg
Some of you asked me for tips for 综合填空!I don’t have a foolproof method but here are some pointers:1. Don’t spend more than 10-15 minutes here! Questions with heavier weightage are at the back2. Read through the whole passage first if possible - this is to ensure that you have a food understanding of where the passage is heading to which helps you to eliminate some words that are more context-specific!3. If point 2 is not possible  do at least read through the paragraph because some of the clues to the questions are not directly before or after the question!4. When you are unsure of the answer  do elimination method first before attempting to guess5. Good to go through past year papers to get a good 语感 for 词语配搭Do share this with your friends and all the best to you kiddos!! 🥰,btohqsg
When it’s the day before exam should I continue studying or just relax and read up,btohqsg
