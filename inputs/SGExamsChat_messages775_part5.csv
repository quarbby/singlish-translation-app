Might be too late to keep right later,btohqsg
I think almost all the fault is with the black car,btohqsg
Like even without the motorcycle and white car the accident would’ve stillHappened,btohqsg
That guy had no reason to speed and 5 business days to slow down after overtaking,btohqsg
Ok but I wonder at what speed was the Mercedes and motorcycle travelling at,btohqsg
I don't think anybody thinks the black car is not most at fault but many think had the white car not agitated intentionally or not towards the black car. The driver of Saab may not have ran through the intersection,btohqsg
If they’re alr near or slightly above the 60 speed limit they have no reason to keep left,btohqsg
Dude like if you’re travelling at the speed limit you can go to the fastest lane what. I think anyone who says otherwise likes to speed lol,btohqsg
maybe they like playing mario cart,btohqsg
need to swerve left and right and drift to go faster,btohqsg
then need to pick up the powerups,btohqsg
There is a rear pov of the Merc  y'all saw it?,btohqsg
Should always keep left but in this scenario the motorcycle is not in the wrong. Yes it would be better if the motorcycle kept left  but it is not wrong for him to be in the right lane since he was going at a decent speed and there was no one tailgating him. If it's a highway then yes the motorcycle should have kept to the left but it's not.,btohqsg
Oh there alr was a car behind the merc. I wonder what speed that car was travelling at though,btohqsg
The rear pov showed the Saab racing past a white Merc behind the motorcycle and swerving around the GLC. So the Saab intent was to speed on that road,btohqsg
Open up reddit yesterday saw the SGE post of a 16 year old getting pregnant and wanting a abortion,btohqsg
I’m more concerned about this car because behind the merc there’s this car on the right lane that’s travelling very slowly,btohqsg
Immediately was like yeah... that's enough reddit for today.,btohqsg
why u quote me i did not mention anything about saab/merc,btohqsg
Oh was just replying to you not that specific comment,btohqsg
There was a E class behind the motorcycle,btohqsg
If the E class is referring to the car  then it does seem like the E class was being too slow,btohqsg
The Saab sped up to cut infront of that e class,btohqsg
But I can’t tell what’s the exact speed,btohqsg
I can’t find any such post on sge,btohqsg
The e class is not seen in any angles except the rest pov,btohqsg
Yep I was like wtf bruh the person was like I have 1.5k is that enough for an abortion,btohqsg
No.. and I didn't have the Alacrity to ask,btohqsg
slow  maybe 40-50. exact speed does not matter... he's not in the wrong. only that he should keep left but given its a small road it doesn't matter that much,btohqsg
From the dashcam of the Facebook video I sent I thought it was taken in the e class,btohqsg
"Has a leadership position in a ""reputable school""",btohqsg
Oh I was thinking J1 but still 16,btohqsg
And went for overseas immersion before in sec3,btohqsg
Bruh reading is like.. if it's true i don't wanna live in this world anymore if it's false this is still a fucked up world we live in where that is considered entrainment,btohqsg
Not wrong but just not very considerate I guess  if the speed limit was 60,btohqsg
The TJC girl goes to the afterlife be like Eh why u here.. oh because some retard decided their time was more important than my life,btohqsg
And with the red light  not like speeding would’ve made a difference,btohqsg
You travel at 60 also still have to stop,btohqsg
The idea is that u speed up enough u cross the line at amber still can,btohqsg
But that's still a fucking stupid proposition,btohqsg
The dashcam videos showed that there were alr cars in front who stopped  so I think the red light was on for a while,btohqsg
Also if he did not speed he could’ve easily stopped,btohqsg
That white car is the e class I'm talking about  this dashcam is from the glc,btohqsg
Isn't it the black car that went thru the traffic,btohqsg
Ya idk why that white car stay on the right lane,btohqsg
u shud just let people do what they want to do,btohqsg
The car directly behind is the Saab speeding up to cut into the lane of that Merc,btohqsg
Motorcyclist was probably travelling at around 60 so it’s fine,btohqsg
The thing is they wanna do it without parental consent.,btohqsg
Think it is.. for like polyclinic need consent one,btohqsg
