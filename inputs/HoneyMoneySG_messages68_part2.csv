Thats why I tend to boycott hawkers with only paynow QR (unless their food is unbelievably good). keep up with the times...,btohqsg
You see the logos below  must use the same app to scan. If u dunno just scan  at most say invalid qr,btohqsg
cause if its online payment   can use to clock for credit card / debit card cashback,btohqsg
We don‚Äôt familiar with what  xxxPay. Be it favepay or Gpay. We more familiar with the logo under the QR code. üòÄ,btohqsg
I think it is because some payment methods have some charge when withdrawing money‚Ä¶ but no charge for paynow,btohqsg
Mean need to prepare a lot of app,btohqsg
Since we started this topic  can I ask highest cashback for QR code like this(so many payments options)? XNAP with uob evol can earn 6.66% cashback?,btohqsg
Less effort = less rewardsMore effort = more rewardsIf you havent realised this is a recurring theme within this telegroup,btohqsg
yes  xnap for hawker is considered online transaction under mcc 5814 (fast food),btohqsg
Depends where you usually visit n spend.,btohqsg
Can I ask what happened to the interest for CPF special account if u have max out 198 000... the interest flow to OA or stack on top of SA..?,btohqsg
Stack on top of SA... But ur salary crediting will all go to OA,btohqsg
Sadly this kind of thing. Even with police report  uob cannot believe u 100% that u are innocent and u didn‚Äôt try to scam people to pay into your bank account.Fact is there were scam activities related to your bank account which was used to receive scam proceeds. That alone is enough for the bank to ban u (whether too harsh or not is another story la).,btohqsg
Correct me if i m wrong...,btohqsg
My understanding is only interest earned from MA will flow to OA when interest credited to your account in Dec/Jan if your MA n SA have hit max. The rest stay in the same acct.,btohqsg
I wonder how to avoid this if its paynow,btohqsg
U cant to be honest. I kena 3 time now still resolving,btohqsg
Did u get any bank problems? Like close your accounts?,btohqsg
What if i just make them transfer to grab instead,btohqsg
Thats how i usually receive payment when selling things,btohqsg
Frozen now  1 time each year due to carousell selling. Third party scam is very hard to spot,btohqsg
Bcs i heard enough about card scams and all but is that a good alternative though,btohqsg
Not all your buyer have grab or willing to use grab to do payment. Best is paylah as it will show sender number. After all the issue  i will call back the paylah number to cross check incoming transfer. But not all buyer have paylah as well. The problem is that paynow u cant vet check,btohqsg
I have got maybank closed for carousell selling. Not due to scam. The compliance team just ask me submit proof for the incoming fund and after i show them they say that personal account cant use for biz usage ( carousell) then they just closed it,btohqsg
Wow hope next time u do business with Maybank won‚Äôt have issue.Maybank family and friend credit card very useful.,btohqsg
I have secured cc with them  it is not cancelled  i guess coz it is collateral against. I know when bank closed account  they closed the cc relationship as well,btohqsg
I spend alot monthly on maybank cc anyway  maybe thry took that into consideration as well.,btohqsg
Hello all!I will be travelling to china and will be using alipay or wepay. I dont have the citi rewards card but have amaze. What is the best combination for miles points? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know what‚Äôs the best credit card to make purchases for say 5-6k? Used to use Standchart Manhattan. Is that still the best card to use? Am ok with both miles and cash back cards.,btohqsg
A close competitor for such large size transactions would be amaze + uob KF credit card at 3 miles per dollar with no cap. Provided your merchant code falls within the online shopping list of merchant codes.,btohqsg
Hello  understand that the best combination for miles is currently the citi rewards + amaze.However I am require to make big ticket items  is there any ways to go around the 1k capped?,btohqsg
I read somewhere on the history saying installment won't net any miles though,btohqsg
Atome is not the same as bank‚Äôs installment plan,btohqsg
Sadly  apple store is not in the list üò≠,btohqsg
Hi all  is it asvisable to invest tbill using cpf oa if my total cpf is 40k  (oa 24k),btohqsg
Is this the way to buy vouchers in the NTUC app for myself? Send to myself? And the vouchers purchased by this method can be used like a FairPrice gift card right- which allows partial use of the value?,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea what‚Äôs the rough minimum annual expenditure for premier Miles fee waiver?,btohqsg
You'll be able to invest only 4k since the first 20k cannot be used,btohqsg
Super dumb question cause I have never set up paper giro before. If its rejected do I get an email or just a return mail or something?,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.aiThe website will also propose a list of best credit cards to use  then you can check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion listGood luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Any way to pay road tax and get some rebate? Or can I spend on my new SCB card to clock the $599 spending and get cash gift?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúRoad tax‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
No  you have an additional +1% on the first $60k,btohqsg
Road Tax should be under government. Use HSBC EGA to get 1% giro cashback. Same as income and property tax.,btohqsg
May i know what is current min spent on frank credit card?,btohqsg
sorry  new to this but citi rewards tag with amaze  the bank is saying that we can't use the amaze card for more that 9 successful transactions? is this true...,btohqsg
üò∞. You call bank on this?,btohqsg
ahh nvm  cs solved the issue alr,btohqsg
i think many credit cards.. you spam too many transactions within a short period (say 10 minutes) you will get soft blocked too,btohqsg
yaya that was what happened üòÇ went on a shopping spree this morning kena then blocked ü•≤,btohqsg
