Technically if more ppl do very well then the grade boundary will be adjusted up  so you are still fighting anyway,btohqsg
It's just not very practical to implement a strict bellcurve when there's (probably) little variation in scores and also potentially doubling people's L1R5 score over a 1 mark diff heh,btohqsg
If the paper is easy. The marks will get higher.,btohqsg
Fyi some question is set specically hard is to differentiate the A and the B,btohqsg

Could someone help meFor my olevel English compo section c. There is descriptive   narrative   argument and discursive writing rightMy school trains all of us to write argument and discursive writing which is never my strong suit . I tried writing an descriptive essay once and my eng cher just failed me without reading it   she advised on me to not write descriptive during olevel . Which I am not sure why ?Number two is I thought narrative and descriptive easier to write   can use the flowery language and I feel that Cambridge markers rather read up those than some boring argument essay .Idk what to do sial,btohqsg
Ok first thing first  ur teacher sucks,btohqsg
Its recommended to do discursive & argumentative cuz the strcuture is generally the same i.e. PEEL,btohqsg
Narrative & descriptive essays may be better since u dun need to come up with points like discursive  and can storytell wtv situation which can be easier,btohqsg
Cambridge markers mark hundreds of papers nonetheless  u may select wtv qns given in ur exam,btohqsg
This late in the year alr  would recc to stick to ur strengths and choose the qn that seems most comfortable to u,btohqsg
Choose narrative/descriptive since ur btr at those  just completely disregard what ur teacher says,btohqsg
Uncle think Niklas is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Haha   I loved howYou straight up dissed my teacher,btohqsg
Sure . I guess I shall write that since narrative is really my strong suit,btohqsg
Wtf go away it‚Äôs up to you what u wan write,btohqsg
I tried out almost all types before,btohqsg
Still can‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm strong at,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just basically based on more of what ur preference are,btohqsg
simi is this dun read then fail ether,btohqsg
Unreliable hence not useful in grading essays smh,btohqsg
tru better to give constructive feedback then just outright deject,btohqsg
for secondary school and jc  i‚Äôd say the academic workshop works pretty well,btohqsg
She even criticized me   called me a clown . Seriously i swear I am not joking .‚Äò .... unless you what to fail your prelim   clown your way there .‚Äô,btohqsg
I swear I lost all of my respect for my eng cher,btohqsg
