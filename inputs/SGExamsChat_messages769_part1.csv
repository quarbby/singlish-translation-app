"""arrests were illegal"" and ""tortured them and forced them to confess""...this is the late 80s not late 40s",btohqsg
Tbh if they were falsely charged  isn‚Äôt it understandable they want to sue the police lol. The prosecution and police basically did not do their due diligence,btohqsg

September to November is ‚Äúone possible window‚Äù for the GE to take place  but Assistant Professor Elvin Ong from the National University of Singapore said he would not rule out the possibility of the election taking place early next year.‚ÄúMaybe just after Budget  perhaps?‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs Budget seems to have mixed reviews  some say oh  it is like an election Budget  some say it is not. So it is kind of unclear.‚ÄùRelated:,btohqsg

Even if it‚Äôs 1Q2025  why would they put it on a Sunday lol,btohqsg
Citizens would be angry they not getting any PH,btohqsg
