OCS material bro  Chuck Norris prays to him every morning,btohqsg
Bedok doesn't dig shellscrape  he looks at the ground and it shrinks into a shellscrape out of fear,btohqsg
hi guys what are complicated ions?,btohqsg
A complex ion is just a metal atom with a bunch of other stuff bonded to it,btohqsg
The central atom is from the transition metals,btohqsg
Or so if I remember my A Levels Chem correctly,btohqsg
but I don't understand what it means,btohqsg
A lvl chem is not true chem,btohqsg
Since u have so much time y don’t u explain,btohqsg
just like how a lvl math is not true math,btohqsg
and i have 3 lessons aft this so im not free,btohqsg
Try asking in the A levels chat,btohqsg
just imagine 3 No3- ions forming a bond towards Fe3+,btohqsg
there are actually 3 more h2o molecules that also form a bond with Fe3+ in fe(no3)3  but for simplicity's sake we write fe(no3)3 instead of fe(no3)3 x 3h2o,btohqsg
no hahaha its in a sec 4 chem textbook,btohqsg
isnt air made of a mixture of elements and not a mixture and elements and compounds?,btohqsg
Got compound too  CO2 is a cpd,btohqsg
ur a geniuss thxx so mch,btohqsg
Actually do u consider N2 element or compound,btohqsg
Jokes on you I don't take chem... oh wait fuck I'm taking a chem mod this sem ahhhhh,btohqsg
"answer is ""either an element or a compound""  why is it not ""element"" it has fixed melt and boil",btohqsg
Is it really fixed though? 🤔,btohqsg
Pure element also have a fixed boiling and melting point,btohqsg
Pure Water is fixed bp and MP  but it's not an elemeny,btohqsg
It's made up of two elements H O,btohqsg
hi did any of yall get interview for Np poly yet for eae?,btohqsg
Sgexams is actually a think outside reddit?,btohqsg
ya but reddit is the best and most important part,btohqsg
she's amazing! but i think don't go dox. she'll say hi if she's comf to,btohqsg
Oh damn she became president scholar,btohqsg
When you become named in mainstream media I don't think you can say if you're doxxed or not,btohqsg
Is it because reddit has the largest Chinese ownership of all the social media platforms SGexams is involved in?/s,btohqsg
Wat do u think all these announcements like the current pinned message are about,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionthe holy grail paper collection thing dont have computing paper 2(theory) can help check if nvr upload or legit dont have,btohqsg
If don’t have means don’t have I guess,btohqsg
does anyone know any sg chat,btohqsg
actually got a channel for it,btohqsg
feels like if got group to discuss politics,btohqsg
your spelling of saizeriya triggers me so much,btohqsg
i dont really follow politics in singapore,btohqsg
u can follow r/politics on reddit ah,btohqsg
reddit has an obvious political bias,btohqsg
u can say the same for any other platform of news tbh,btohqsg
i think its up to how biased you want your news to be lol,btohqsg
go.exams.sg/discordhas channels for local issues and global issues,btohqsg
i am studying medicine in my alternate reality,btohqsg
hello anybody here goes to NEX often,btohqsg

anyone else suffering from shit internet from singtel,btohqsg
ive been experiencing that since april 2020,btohqsg
Also am starving in a way,btohqsg
Am I allowed to ironically put the shopee ad ?,btohqsg
Like I want to change course,btohqsg
honestly just make ur own kimbap yum yum,btohqsg
I think I’m going to change to biomed engineering,btohqsg
That’s what my gf would say to me,btohqsg
nothing much to cook when making a kimbap friend,btohqsg
And what’s the difference between sushi and Kimbap,btohqsg
hey.. we're all just some burritos fr,btohqsg
Speaking of sushi I wanna try the salmon noodles,btohqsg
And also taking Econ’s is disgusting,btohqsg
well if you're talking abt the sushi rolls then the difference is that sushi rice mix w vinegar and kimbap rice mix w sesame oil  and sushi has fish usually raw but kimbap u use other meats and even canned stuff,btohqsg
wow salmon noodles from orchard road,btohqsg
I heard it’s great I think,btohqsg
Anyone here tried using starwax before ?,btohqsg
Star wax like the shoe polish?,btohqsg
That’s such an army shoe polish,btohqsg
I am aware but is it better than kiwi ?,btohqsg
It took me hours to polish my NCC boots,btohqsg
Oh sounds like the perfect thing for me,btohqsg
No wonder my boots black af,btohqsg
I have saphir for mirror shine,btohqsg
I just wanted to protect the leather from dirt and mud for the week,btohqsg
And i dont want to waste saphir for that haahahah and the only other thing i have is the issued starwax,btohqsg
How do you protect the weather,btohqsg
You want free speech you go to free platform.,btohqsg
the heck does that even mean,btohqsg
Reddit also bans a lot of other things it does not like,btohqsg
Telegram isn't exactly a public communication platform  but I assume it has enough encryption for you to send beep boop to whoever who wants to receive it,btohqsg
oo oo aa aa hooga booga oo oo aa aa,btohqsg
oo oo aa aa hooga booga oo oo aa aa,btohqsg
anyone from SIT ICT IS/SE can share me lecture notes/past yr exam paper for any modules? thanks!,btohqsg
anyone has o level oral tips/format for the 3 questions 😭,btohqsg
U speak like a normal person and speak whats in ur head,btohqsg
Short yet succinct can be more impactful tjan long and unrelated,btohqsg
what were the last few oral topic ah,btohqsg
1. Skills vs studying2. Games/family3. Elderly4. Internet/studying in cafe,btohqsg
Is there anyone in SIT? Is it a difficult sch to get into?,btohqsg
From what i heard not that tough,btohqsg
Cause my diploma isn’t recognized. So not sure if they will be willing to accept. But don’t rlly have the money to go private,btohqsg
hi! is there anyone taking ELL? would like to ask if hwachong offers the ELL scholarship,btohqsg
i heard that they only provide the subject but not the scholarship?,btohqsg
ELL - english language and linguistics,btohqsg
If I remembered correctly  only ri and cj offers elep.,btohqsg
ohh ok  do you know if their programmes differ? like ri ELL vs acjc ELL,btohqsg
for example humanities scholarship differs in their way of teaching in each school,btohqsg
I'm not too sure about that  you might want to check out respective school's open house or email them for more info.,btohqsg
okay that’s a good idea  thank you!,btohqsg
how do examiners actually grade oral? talk more = more marks?,btohqsg
My oral quite chill and my topic was very relatable,btohqsg
But i still need to pray to get good marks,btohqsg
Fluency  tone  expressiveness  pronunciation  execution of SI...,btohqsg
Just be natural and just chat la,btohqsg
yea jus be confident and poised,btohqsg
is it actually impossible to fail oral as long you do reading aloud well and speak at least a little for spoken interaction?,btohqsg
I once had a ridiculous topic (at least for me). I spoke very little but still passed. Although my overall grade was affected. The rest of my class got an easier and orthodox question. Unfair but this is part and parcel of life,btohqsg
The new sports centre that replaced Singapore indoor stadium. I have never been there  don't know anything about it and I just spoke a sentence.I was so scared and the examiners asked me to drink some water,btohqsg
It was something along the lines of 我周末跟朋友去那里（the name of the place）打篮球。I have zero idea about it,btohqsg
As my name was at the top of the list for my class alphabetically  the rest of the class received a super easy question about text messages and mobile phones,btohqsg
After that the examiner asked  你有没有去过那里,btohqsg
she try make your day brighter ahaha,btohqsg
The first part about some reading was okay,btohqsg
Maybe I passed the first part and the second was a utter failure,btohqsg
I don't play sports  that's the thing,btohqsg
i like dancing although im a guy i feel that i'll enjoy dancing because very sexy,btohqsg
Anyways  the other parts helped me pull everything up,btohqsg
If not for this oral it would probably be an A.Whatever  A level H1 Chinese is pretty useless,btohqsg
is it possible for mother tongue moderation to be 45/100 for a C6? Given i heard this year's cohort did shit,btohqsg
i sit back  relax  close my eyes and never wake up anymore,btohqsg
help me collect paper  my maid will send u sch address,btohqsg
Just note that ur oral and LC marks are fixed. There will only be moderation for P1 and P2.,btohqsg
is moderation fixed before exam day or after they see cohort's result for example mother tongur,btohqsg
They base it more on the difficulty only not rly on the cohort,btohqsg
Dun make sense to adjust the A to damn Low if the cohort do damn bad,btohqsg
At that point the cohort dun deserve a lot of A,btohqsg
job so hard to find rn,btohqsg
2020 grads took one for the team,btohqsg
Can I report to a school if the students like keep hogging the place even when the staff tell them not to? Context : they just buy a drink and sit at there and study. Many ppl just want to find seats and to eat but they couldn't find any space because the students have their books scattered everywhere and even littered the floor with the foolscap papers. The staffs actually told them nicely twice and they just said 'We are still dining don't chase us away and not for us you don't have salary'.,btohqsg
The school will likely do an announcement to all students,btohqsg
you definitely can; my school occasionally has the principal call us all on ms teams to speak sadly at us whenever 'members of the public' complain about shit,btohqsg
Anywaydining don't chase us away and not for us you don't have salarydefinitely sounds rude,btohqsg
But if you can live and let live,btohqsg
i wanna know which school ;n;,btohqsg
ist studying at cafe normal unless they tell u away,btohqsg
or they told them away and they dont wanna leave,btohqsg
one time i rlly no choice cuz everywhere to study is choped  i chose a diner w nobody at all  asked if can study there  got permission  bought 3 drinks for just myself and to keep the business going  and studied there,btohqsg
but i guess this is a very diff case,btohqsg
that's fine; but in this case they were just hogging space lol,btohqsg
use ur best judgement and it'll be fine lol,btohqsg
Its kfc macs and burger king,btohqsg
i understand that now library close v hard to find place to study  but doing all those things like wtf sia,btohqsg
I mean like now jewel have like a study corner.....,btohqsg
I wrote to the company and they called back and said,btohqsg
have meh? can share where? i need,btohqsg
They will ban students from studying,btohqsg
Yes but what if they do it to other shops?,btohqsg
cant stop those assholes i guess,btohqsg
The other shop problem - also only fast food and some sbux have this problem massively,btohqsg
So yeah students are welcome to go into [insert not so popz place here],btohqsg
Then again  IDK where not popz liao,btohqsg
All the cafes I know have queue outside on weekend,btohqsg
'bringing back the slow food industry'- sg students,btohqsg
To those taking their Os mtl paper results tdy:ATB 😸,btohqsg
I can flex to my brother,btohqsg
I secured a position in NTU at the moment  if I re-apply for another position in NTU next year  will my position be forfeited?,btohqsg
No  usually NS holds it for you,btohqsg
pray to bell curve god now,btohqsg
wE dOnT hAvE bEll cUrve wE uSe mOdeRaTion,btohqsg
Moderation is better than bell curve anyway,btohqsg
It is a fact that u r compared to an absolute set of standards,btohqsg
MOE can tweak proportion of A/B grades with respect to how many philosophers  scientists they need etc,btohqsg
Thats why for language subjects  dist rates arent that high,btohqsg
it was meant as a joke,btohqsg
no need to get political 😔,btohqsg
Im just bored in my lecture,btohqsg
Cause I got a slot in Civil Engineering but I want to apply for Common Engineering,btohqsg
Why not do internal course change,btohqsg
And by faculty i mean NTU engie  and not the kpop band,btohqsg
Find their school principal's email and write in,btohqsg
Report  write email and send to principal  cc to Discipline master,btohqsg
If got photo or name is even better,btohqsg
Give time location   and tell the principal this issue is not just with the restaurant u're dining in  but also at other food places,btohqsg
Contact details can usually be found from the school website,btohqsg
Quite a standard solution method tho,btohqsg
Easiest way is to change to polar,btohqsg
why got hair on the paper,btohqsg
Because I shed a lot of hair.,btohqsg
You mean it is forbidden to have hair on a paper?,btohqsg
Doesn't mean every strand of hair I have is of equal length,btohqsg
yup got it alr thanks v much,btohqsg
any tips on dealing w friends who treat you like their therapist 😍,btohqsg
😭 they alr have a therapist but apparently said therapist is busy rn,btohqsg
i cannot take it alr it's so draining,btohqsg
they need to find a different therapist then,btohqsg
or pay the therapist more to get priority time,btohqsg
at this point i need the therapy,btohqsg
U can go to ong milo,btohqsg
Thats the only one that rhymes and doesnt sound werid,btohqsg
What u want me to say,btohqsg
He wrote many bed time stories,btohqsg
My head hurts from thinking about that book,btohqsg
Well a hijack is just another word for ‘not answering question’,btohqsg
Maybe u won’t get marked down but it won’t be marked well,btohqsg
My p1 pull down p2 pull up,btohqsg
Lc pull down oral pull up,btohqsg
My p1 compo 离题 too much LOL,btohqsg
I feel that i want to retake but i do not want to feel the rigour in chinese lesson  like instead of reteaching give us tips or spelling and i would definitely retake Chinese,btohqsg
And also when i see other people able to study for other subjects while i am stuck with chinese will sort of make me give up,btohqsg
Interested to know if people here have used these before. I'm assuming those born in the 90s and before should have used these quite a lot. Not sure about those born in the 2000s,btohqsg
hi all does anyone have any gud resource to learn chinese lit or history,btohqsg
I guess you’d first have to start learning how to read Classical Chinese,btohqsg
is this the right chat to ask,btohqsg
dude did u come back to mi recently,btohqsg
or maybe he did and idk,btohqsg
lol@imindomiehow tf u mistake hans for me,btohqsg
I SAW ONE OF THE COUNCILLORS,btohqsg

guys I need some advice 😫 so I’ve gotten B3 but wasn’t happy abt it cuz technically the school gave me a targetted score of A2 and even the Teachers were kinda disappointed cuz they think I can do betterHowever becuz I’m from NA so if I convert to N-Level I will still get A1  I have mixed feeling abt whether I shld rlly retake or just leave it becuz everyone is telling me I’m just wasting my time??,btohqsg
one year just to save one grade,btohqsg
I mean if u don’t plan on going to O levels,btohqsg
Are u intending to go JC? If not  no point taking Chinese also   use the time to study for the other subject for the L1R4,btohqsg
And trust me  if u don't retake  what happen in my sch was all the Chinese lessons became free period and those time can really be used for all other subjects,btohqsg
Not just JC  o levels in general,btohqsg
But anyway if the only reason to retake is pride  I don’t really recommend it  unless ur chinese that important to you,btohqsg
If you have confidence and/or is aiming to get A1 then retake. And/or if u feel this 2-point difference will matter  then yes retake. Every decision depends on your ultimate goal.,btohqsg
That time i got B4 and retook cos i knew chinese was a good chance to get A1 compared to some other subjects,btohqsg
Don't waste time. Look at what you wanna do in life,btohqsg
what does the economics subject teach in jc? trying to plan a subj combi right now,btohqsg
It teaches about markets and the economy of a country,btohqsg
If u want that A sure u can go retake but since u know it’s alr equivalent A in Ns then retaking to get A is kinda pointless if u are not moving on to O levels next year,btohqsg
Yes thisBut this stage is stepping stone for them lo,btohqsg
Well just depends on whether he’s going to take Os next year,btohqsg
And lots of essay writing right?,btohqsg
Coz for O level subjects B3 converts to A1 in Ns,btohqsg
Like H1 is purely case study qn,btohqsg
Oh h1! And no essay? So good??,btohqsg
The format is 2 sets of case studies 45 marks each,btohqsg
Well there’s no essay qn but like sometimes people would say the high marks qn works like an essay qn,btohqsg
But at least u have the extract as evidence,btohqsg
So is like o levels ss and history,btohqsg
But u write a lot more,btohqsg
H2 has essays+essay has higher weightage,btohqsg
And essay is a separate paper,btohqsg
Ya this one is the tedious one,btohqsg
Plus u have a more content than the H1 counterpart,btohqsg
But some people are weak at case study qn so rip,btohqsg
H1 econs essay carried my grade though because 'model answers' can be memorised ;(,btohqsg
Agreed. Essays are way easier than case studies.,btohqsg
just curious how is econs like in jc,btohqsg
im deciding if im taking econs,btohqsg
It's split between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is Demand and supply  market failure etc.Macroeconomics is  inflation  trade etc.,btohqsg
Personally  I enjoyed it. Although it was frustrating as a lot of things are watered down,btohqsg
So you don't get the full picture or things don't really make complete sense  as they cut things out,btohqsg
Maybe looking at past papers would help you come to a decision,btohqsg
You are expected to draw diagrams like this,btohqsg
They say lots of essay writing and is like very humans subject,btohqsg
Economics is a social science  not arts,btohqsg
It is very useful neverthelessJamus Lin is econs graduate 😂,btohqsg
But for A levels they classify it as arts,btohqsg
demand and supply as in higher demand but lower supply == higher cost,btohqsg
how do I start learning hakka,btohqsg
HAHAHA I’m honoured that you actually remember I’m Hakka lol,btohqsg
tried to speak to my grandaunt but i didn't know hakka at all,btohqsg
Ermz the only reason why I was able to pick up Hakka was because my grandma’s MT is Hakka  so it started by like asking my Mother what my grandma was saying  and I picked it up.After my grandma passed away  I maintained it by switching to Hakka rather than Mandarin to speak to my mother.,btohqsg
HAHA tbh language abit hard to pickup unless you will be using it,btohqsg
So are you going to pick it up or did you just give up ayyyy,btohqsg
What you can do is learn languages online. You can arrange for 1 to 1 sessions with a teacher who can teach you everything. I'm learning cantonese now through online lessons. Best if you can read Chinese characters well,btohqsg
I’d be surprise if there are Hakka courses available,btohqsg
I have to  for my grandaunt,btohqsg
I want to know what she's saying,btohqsg
Hakka is always one of the last thought of dialect,btohqsg
Personally  I find Singapore cantonese is not really what I want to learn. I prefer the guangzhou dialect,btohqsg
Let me see if the website i use has it,btohqsg
Ye  start one word by one word.,btohqsg
I can't find any on the website I use  but I found a malaysian on another website,btohqsg
My teacher for cantonese is amazing. Expect to spend some time though. They use 粤文 not normal chinese for example你近排點呀？In mandarin it is 你最近怎样啊？They also teach you how to translate.I want to learn Shanghainese next. I can only speak a few words of shanghainese so I want to learn more.,btohqsg
Translate as in  read a mandarin text in cantonese,btohqsg
Ye  they might politically be classified the same main language but there are vocabs that exists in some dialects but not others.,btohqsg
Very. The best way to learn is to talk to a native. And force yourself to talk. Books  online materials only get you so far.My cantonese teacher always corrects my pronunciation. And he also introduces the six tones with yutping which most cantonese speakers won't know.I can't find a suitable one from Guangzhou so I had to find one from Hong Kong.,btohqsg
The syntax is different and the vocabulary can be very similar but can be very different,btohqsg
If you know mandarin  it may be to your advantage  but it may be to your disadvantage.,btohqsg
Although I think it is an advantage overall,btohqsg
Ya i fully agree with the first point. I cant keep still n focus on books or materials for longer than 1 min anyway too,btohqsg
Okay then maybe learning from a family member in daily convo is effective i guess?,btohqsg
Yep  I figured out why I couldn’t find a Hakka translation for some Mandarin stuff after I took a Chinese Linguistics mod in Uni. I was looking for something that doesn’t exist. HAHA,btohqsg
Because your cantonese would be mandarin based which is bad. You will rely on mandarin vocabulary which is wrong.For example  in cantonese  菜单 is called 餐牌. Or change money is 唱钱. It is very different.The syntax is also different. The expressions are also different.For example  you cannot say 吗 in cantonese. It is 呀,btohqsg
For example  为什么doesn’t exist in Hakka  why in Hakka is 做什么  which is also What in Mandarin and Hakka. In Hakka  whether it is Why or What depends on how you phrase the question.,btohqsg
My family can't speak well. They would call a school 书馆 which is archaic. It is like mandarin  学校.,btohqsg
Or say malay words in between,btohqsg
Actually i find that interestingLike they actually have synonyms for chinese vocabs,btohqsg
No wonder many malaysians say something like that in mandarin. Thanks for the insight,btohqsg
I tot peranakans are majorly teochew,btohqsg
What do you mean by synonyms for chinese vocabs,btohqsg
Well  my great grandfather married a woman from Sanshui or Sam Sui  Foshan  Guangdong. That's where the term samsui women comes from,btohqsg
Not always. But I am still learning so I'm not amazing.Sometimes it is easier to explain in english. For example  想 in cantonese only covers 'want'. Not 'think'. Think is 諗,btohqsg
My father isn't. Only my mother is. Not sure if I count,btohqsg
But my parents don't speak much mandarin.,btohqsg
Not even malay  because they somehow chose chinese over malay for MTL,btohqsg
The whole pass down heritage on Father side is a social construct,btohqsg
I find it hard to communicate with hongkong ppl or cantonese,btohqsg
I don't identify as peranakanBut my family loves mee siam for Chinese New Year. And curry. Not really any chinese food,btohqsg
Okay lah They still can speak english so is fine,btohqsg
Because HK cantonese has it's own twist. And although there are some english loan words  suprisingly most are borrowed from mandarin. Some from the other chinese languages,btohqsg
HAHA funny thing is  if I were to follow the pass down heritage from Father social construct. I am a Hakka  but I learned my Hakka from my maternal side  and I speak better Hakka than my Father lmaoz,btohqsg
Min nan hua is very complex actually. My paternal grandfather is from Fukien. One character can have multiple pronunciations.I prefer cantonese as that is what my maternal side speaks. I don't spend much time with my paternal side,btohqsg
Their tongues like entangled when they speak chinese,btohqsg
They make me feel tongue tied too,btohqsg
But i really wanted to learn canto For so long alr,btohqsg
I think for singaporeans what is tough for cantonese is reading 想、張 etc as they have the -eung suffix which is harder to pronounce.,btohqsg
My family can't pronounce it properly,btohqsg
You want me to recommend you my teacher?It's about $20 for 50 minutes for a 1-1 session. Cheaper than 1-1 tuition in general  haha,btohqsg
There are also cheaper teachers out there,btohqsg
I just wanna learn it from my mom,btohqsg
I dun wanna incur extra expenditure,btohqsg
Okay. It's just that there's an issue I find with singaporean cantonese. Complex ideas is hard to put across. Sometimes I want to have a good and very complex discussion. Many singaporeans seem to noy understand when I start using complex vocabulary in Cantonese. Maybe it exists but the general populace don't really encounter such things,btohqsg
I wanna learn from mom cos i need real life,btohqsg
Maybe the singaporean cantonese is not that complex yet,btohqsg
Anyway not many canto speakers around i feel :/,btohqsg
Compared to hokkien and teochew ppl in sg,btohqsg
That's only one way. Not two ways. So your pronunciation and usage cannot be corrected,btohqsg
Two way convo learn super fast,btohqsg
My mom will correct me on the spot,btohqsg
Even with Singaporeans Min nan I find it limiting from what I hear people say. I can understand it but I can't speak it.I don't like the term hokkien as it means 福建. Foochownese don't speak the hokkien that you think,btohqsg
And even tell me how our tongue should slur,btohqsg
潮汕话 and 闽南话 is very similar,btohqsg
Actually it is called min nan yu right? Not hokkie right?,btohqsg
Yes  in 闽南话 it is read.Man Nam Wei,btohqsg
Mandarin has way more tongue twisters. For example 那儿 is read Na-r as one syllable.哈尔滨 is red Ha-r- bin as two syllables. By the way  the name harbin is actually manchu  not chineseYour tongue has to bend.,btohqsg
In the north of china  many people say zhei ge for 这个 and nei ge for 那个,btohqsg
Because it is next door to each other. Lingustically chaozhou/teochew and shantou/swatowis closer to the south of fujian than the rest of guangdong,btohqsg
No.. it is called 粤东地区. In this area there is 梅州/梅县 which is a very hakka place,btohqsg
I have been to chaozhou and shantou and xiamen myself,btohqsg
But chaozhou and shantou don't have many international tourists and it's not very modern.,btohqsg
Wuhan used to be three cities.  汉口、汉阳、武昌. Merged by the ROC government to become wuhan,btohqsg
I have poly friend from wuhan too,btohqsg
Which is the part of china closest to russia??,btohqsg
