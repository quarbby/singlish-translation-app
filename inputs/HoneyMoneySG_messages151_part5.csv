Sorry if anyone asked before but can i just ask  how does uob ladys card work with simplygo? If i select the transport cat  since it is $5 block and most of the rides will be <$5  can i just assume i wont get the 1x UOB$ but just the 9x UOB$ at the end of the month,btohqsg
Yes. You can still get 1x for some as it's how Mastercard works.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/245917,btohqsg
You must continuously use as SimplyGo for MasterCard accumulates before posting.,btohqsg
Visa one is wrong  transactions accumulate daily  and post few business days after.,btohqsg
Its specific to uob visa. Its posted every day but accumulated once a month for bonus.,btohqsg
Bonus points accumulated at the end of month. Transactions don't.,btohqsg

Hey everyone  seeking suggestions on what savings / checking account to achieve highest interest rate.Have to exclude those with salary crediting bonus (working in a bank  can't choose other competitors as to credit my salary),btohqsg
Where do you see this campaign? I don't see it on the HeyMax AI interface,btohqsg
Maybe uob one if you can hit credit card spend?Elsehttps://youtu.be/sMLJ6HqoeBEPlz double check interests as nerfs happened,btohqsg
Wow that’s bad  luckily I have redeemed it last month,btohqsg
I don’t have uob one card  looking for min $500/ mth tier,btohqsg
Yeah  saw this. But even if I would to hit the min. spend with UOB One card  the interest would only be 0.65%. Unless I do GIRO to 3 account (which is super mafan) in order to bring it to 2%,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I choose family for uob lady's card can I use it at NTUC or is it strictly online only,btohqsg
You may like to advise how much savings are you referring to as having 50k  100k or 150k would make a difference.,btohqsg
Search in chat uob one salary credit,btohqsg
You can still salary credit by your own.,btohqsg
not on Heymax app yet i think,btohqsg
Can recurring telco bills earn 10xpoints if I use amaze + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Hi all experts  eh can I ask  which credit card would b good to use for the nets flashpay auto topup and b able to earn miles? 😅,btohqsg
Nope  I checked with UOB staff. It doesn't allow it anymore,btohqsg
Please ignore UOB one. I sent u the link already. Check tat video and see which one is suitable.,btohqsg
Hi experts  is it better to put the savings into CIMB fast saver account or UOB one? Thanks,btohqsg
Nope  don't think it's great. Right now I just maintain min. balance in all banks  and put most of my savings in SA Simple & Simple +,btohqsg
Nani  what did you choose? Just PayNow and what did you input as?,btohqsg
"I tried multiple occasion to use PayNow with ""PayNow SAL""  ""SAL""  ""SALARY"". All not counted sia",btohqsg
Use dbs normal bank transfer and select salary as purpose,btohqsg
Don't have to. Just put the purpose.,btohqsg
Don't use FAST or PayNow and it should be OK.Remarks doesn't matter.,btohqsg
Oh  so FAST is OK for UOB?,btohqsg
Maybe I was confused with other banks to dbs. I remembered FAST doesn't work for either one.,btohqsg
So this only works with DBS / OCBC?,btohqsg
Basically you can use any banks which allows you to choose the purpose.I tried with Maybank and it worked too.,btohqsg
Tried doing so with Citi  not working,btohqsg
Maybe I shall try with DBS / POSB later. OCBC don't seem to have Salary as a purpose of transfer,btohqsg
Lol. You need to wait at least one day. Just be patient.,btohqsg
Oh LOL  opps. I saw Dy did it  I thought it was almost instantaneous hahahah,btohqsg
It says as of 24 Jan... Ur salary credit is dated 25 Jan... Wait for it to update bah.,btohqsg
Paynow also ok so long can choose purpose as salary payment,btohqsg
OK  thanks.... Then I will strike through my entire msg to avoid misleading others. My bad...,btohqsg
how much savings? what criteria u can meet?,btohqsg
