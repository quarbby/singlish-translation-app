Hi guys  if uob evol cycle begins on 1st August. Will the nerf already be affecting this month (august) statement? ie still worth to use evol?,btohqsg
yes nerfed already. See if there are better cards for your spending.,btohqsg
If you can meet $800 min spend  able to get around 3.75% cashback for local spend only.,btohqsg
Does self transfer salary for ocbc 360 counted towards the interest?,btohqsg
Is it $30 max rebate for local spend if hit $800?🙏,btohqsg
For china credit card spending  my view is to use trust card and put into Alipay and Wechat Pay,btohqsg
Cimb 3.5% fresh funds the best offer now?,btohqsg
Mine start 2 Aug  is it nerf now?,btohqsg
Amt pls and what card u have left,btohqsg
Hi am trying to understand: if I have 150k now and places it to UOB one acct does it automatically Enroll me in the building a nation of savers promo? And rip the maximum interest for this one account?(Will have sal credit and spend 500 monthly here) thank you,btohqsg
need to enroll on the website,btohqsg
Or do I need to apply the account  then participate in the savers promo then place in the funds. Much appreciated. Tq,btohqsg
do u already have uob one account or not?,btohqsg
Nope. Planning to do it right now 😅,btohqsg
(1) Open UOB one account(2) Register for the promo online(3) Deposit 150k2 and 3 can be done in any order. It's best to do in the same month.,btohqsg
Got it! Thanks Anthony & Trazora.,btohqsg
Hi all  do you know if it is able to waive the annual fee (10000 UNI$) for UOB lady's solitaire card?,btohqsg
"got a error when I click ""waive fees""",btohqsg
UNI$ is diducted yesterday  idk why,btohqsg
Omg we have ppl asking this everywhere,btohqsg
All the male Lady card holders. 🤣,btohqsg
Credit card giro payment thru hsbc EGA still get 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Hi all   got question regarding utility   I’m currently using SC journey   with the exclusion in sept . I’m looking for alternative   I’m trying to apply for Maybank VI but I doubt I’ll be able to get it with my current income . What is the best cashback card option   if my sp total bill is avg about 10k a month ? Thanks,btohqsg
2k on maybank platinum visa  the rest on uob absolute amexedit: 2k (min 5 transactions) on uob one  2k on maybank platinum visa  the rest uob absolute,btohqsg
Hi folks...used to be able to pay one time using cc on M1 app on my monthly bill  but it seems like it's not working anymore..anyone having the same problem?,btohqsg
Is Maybank platinum visa and UOB one similar ? If that’s the case can I 2k on Maybank 2k UOB one then rest on absolute Amex ?,btohqsg
yes  note the uob one need min 5 transactions in a statement month,btohqsg
Hi anyone has OCBC referral code? For some reason Chris one does not work :(,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For which? I tested some links  they are fine.,btohqsg
May I ask if Maybank Platinum Visa 2K spend requirements need any min transactions?,btohqsg
Need 2k spend that's all. If insurance only 50% of tier spend.,btohqsg
Oh I see . One last question   how to calculate the 3.33% + 1 % I search sp and UOB website but none of their calculations make sense to me . Does it means if I make min 5 transaction + 2k min to sp I get 4.33% per quarter ( $259.8),btohqsg
Additional 1% cashback for that SP transaction for that month.,btohqsg
So meaning to say 2000* 4.33% = $86.6 / per month,btohqsg
200 quarterly rebate+1%×2000=$20 monthly total 260 quarterly,btohqsg
Usually UNI$ will be deducted if request annual fee waiver?,btohqsg
Will deduct first then you request for waiver after,btohqsg
Then will credit back?Worth use UNI$ to deduct annual fees?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/07/16/how-do-uobs-automatic-uni-deductions-for-annual-fees-work/Will credit the uni$ back if waiver is granted. Which is good because it extends that sum of uni$.Waiver > cash annual fee > uni$ annual fee,btohqsg
I am also waiting.😱I was taking for granted that it would happen like every alternate month.May I ask what is next best option other than ocbc hsbc uob? Scb?,btohqsg
Hard to answer for your specific case.Easier if you prepare these:- fund amount- salary credit- spend on applicable cardsThen see for each bank what is the effective %p.a. you'll get,btohqsg
T bill result is out? What is the rate?,btohqsg
Right. My bad.I used have 350k reserved for EGA. Can do salary credit and spend on cards,btohqsg
