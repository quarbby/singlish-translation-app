Is tanking multiple projects a semester a good idea,btohqsg
I got trash groups for three of my mods,btohqsg
I remember tanking a project for one whole sem,btohqsg
They fucked up slides dk how to write script,btohqsg
Dk date of presentation and never attend call,btohqsg
I suggest to go soft and then hard on them,btohqsg
If you have a project given on mon and due on sun,btohqsg
You go soft on them first,btohqsg
Say like aiya when do you think you wanna complete this? Thursday? Friday? What you are doing here is allowing them to choose a appropriate date before finalising and submitting it,btohqsg
Let's just say friday 12 pm,btohqsg
If they still didn't do their work,btohqsg
Saying like by friday 9 pm i expect quality work to be done,btohqsg
And if they still don't give a fuck,btohqsg
Tank the rest yourself or split it equally among the rest,btohqsg
one of my groupmates ponnteng all of the calls,btohqsg
The other transferred to my class because all of his groupmates form his old class marked him down,btohqsg
But you really think attempting to motivate poor groupmates is a good idea,btohqsg
What if they do subpar work,btohqsg
If you tried your best motivating them and they are still an obstinate piece of shit,btohqsg
How tiring is tanking a project and getting A btw,btohqsg
For me i tank imp in sem 1,btohqsg
I need to tank 3 projects this semester,btohqsg
Hmm learn to have some trust,btohqsg
Even if they do their work it's probably gonna be trash,btohqsg
Instead of pushing everything to yourself,btohqsg
