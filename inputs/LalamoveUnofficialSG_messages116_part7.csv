For mission  they only give to the top 15 percent or 20 percent of driversHow they rate u is base on number of order  and rating and cancellation rateThe higher score u get  the better mission u getBronze  silver  gold etcGold mission reward highest etcJuz an example  i dun knw e exact reward,btohqsg

Hi guys  I'm new to food delivery... Can I ask  how do you carry drinks or soup without spilling,btohqsg
Everytime I put in the bag it spills,btohqsg
If you can put your divider near to either side of the bag,btohqsg
If not its extremely easy to spill the water/soup,btohqsg
Just adjust the item size accordingly so at least the items will not spill,btohqsg
How come the bag that I got from lalamove got no divider?,btohqsg
Huh? They suppose to provide de HAHAHA,btohqsg
Another method is buying a $8 cup holder le,btohqsg
