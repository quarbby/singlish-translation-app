https://www.nextinsight.net/story-archive-mainmenu-60/943-2020/13847-riverstone-now-trading-at-only-8-6x-fy21f-p-ethey need to revise the TARGET PRICE !!,btohqsg

AmWif u on cosco.. after 20c is 5 bids,btohqsg
6 dollars stock in the past,btohqsg
Wasted the chance to get out on oct 14....,btohqsg
but why MT still around 11x   do u know the reason?,btohqsg
Actually RS also up a lot,btohqsg
please study the MT result    QTR 2 to QTR 3 revenue ??  122 mil to 124 mil  just an increase of 2 mil. ? Investor not only look at profit but also the cost and revenue !! which meant ASP increase but production volume drop !! profit increased due to profit margin wider,btohqsg
What is fair value to you?,btohqsg
Yes it seems like bottleneck production somehowFor whatever reasonSince space and manpower are in abundance in phil,btohqsg
Huh...please lah q3 results is more than q1 +q2,btohqsg
mt very interesting.. everyday inch up abit and now cornered by trendlines,btohqsg
Up or down...my guess is up,btohqsg
Everyday creeping up with low vol,btohqsg
looks abit similar to riverstone chart few weeks back,btohqsg
Ya...breaking up time then volume will come in,btohqsg
look at the revenue  not the profit. investor look at future growth  and we know that face mask is not rising  maybe PPE will gain more profit,btohqsg
U talking about profits or revenue...u know they are different,btohqsg
He asking you to look at the revenue growth quarter to quarter,btohqsg
MT is poised for a big move upwards,btohqsg
Q2 is already quite high...unrealistic to expect explosive growth every q right,btohqsg
The fact q3 is higher shows a lot le,btohqsg
anyway MT 50-days moving is turning down since 2 weeks ago !! bearish sign  But if the price move up above 123 with good volume    then maybe MT can turn up,btohqsg
rest 90 days liao  ma100 also will turn down,btohqsg
MT - i will load up more if break 123 with good volume. BUT i will dump when it hit 140 to 150 !!,btohqsg
For glove I think value for $$ and future potential aspen is best bet,btohqsg
Yup set ur own tp...comfortable can liao,btohqsg
They only just started med gloves right? Got license from gov,btohqsg
Factory done next year q2 start producing,btohqsg
Not sure start liao ma....but got license liao,btohqsg
Cheers  if only everyday stock market is like today.,btohqsg
When production start price maybe 50 plus,btohqsg
