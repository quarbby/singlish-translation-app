As long as u as a director paying yourself a salary its not illegal. Proper documentation is important,btohqsg
If you have a genuine business  I don't see any issue then. üëç,btohqsg
Genuine business with brick and mortar with minimal staffs with revenue. Just never put much effort into it,btohqsg
Agree. Can even have multiple companies paying you multiple salaries  getting max cpf from multiple companies. It's all legal.,btohqsg
Exactly so i dunno what red flags,btohqsg
Its only when i close the company becauae i max out my cpf already i get jammed,btohqsg
Because cant justify to bank for holding that kind of credit limit without any income,btohqsg
Yes  can supplement my youtrip $400. But rates are slightly lousier than yt,btohqsg
For reference and benefit of others who are interested.,btohqsg

most CCs have a secured version with a 10k deposit - you can look at chris's videos on his CC strategy for some recommendations.credit limit is up to the amount you put down as deposit,btohqsg
Last time I have a credit card also for student. If I not wrong credit limit is 500 to 600 . Citi bank,btohqsg
Can be 90-100 percent of deposit put,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Do you all usually set credit limit for credit card you apply...,btohqsg
Curious on why need a Credit Card where Debit Card do the same thing. If you need a FD to secure it.,btohqsg
no  unless you specifically want a small credit limit,btohqsg
Haha.. I set up about 2500 for dbs woman card.. also no more set high l√†. Bonus point already cut to 1500,btohqsg
I dont think theres any harm in having a high credit limit?,btohqsg
a secured CC still comes with all the usual features of a CC. naturally if you don't need or want any of those features then a debit card works just fine,btohqsg
Maybe it's because credit card have better rewards? OP will have to see if needing a FD is worth it though,btohqsg
IMO. Got ways to cash out? If no  then no point having high limits. Cos i think overall limit is cap at MAS. Having higher limit (for my initial few cards) mean i could not apply for cards or get super low limits for subsequent application (for other banks).,btohqsg
Like some bros say high ticket expenses go for which no cap on spending . Eg uob kris flyer . That I feel set up 8 to 10k is ok,btohqsg
Thanks! Just changed mine to dbs wwmc for the following months,btohqsg
yup  looking into secured credit card as i am booking a trip to europe with my friends later this year.i already own a student credit card but the credit limit is a bit low and only offers up to 1% cashback for my card.,btohqsg

How much you pay monthly for the gym fee,btohqsg
No only base miles of 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
cardup only earns base  no bonusbest to use general spending card  re: uob prvi for myself,btohqsg
I want to fulfill the OCBC 360 account card spend. Would OCBC 90N CC works better in terms of miles with card up?,btohqsg
ah  but yeah u only earn base 0.4,btohqsg
Hey. Now u introduced another reasonNever update income documents when demanded by the bankOf course u kenna account closure.,btohqsg
89.25. It was 2023 8% 18 months,btohqsg
And I realised we had this discussion a while agohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/182811,btohqsg
Really is the case of play stupid games win stupid prizes le.,btohqsg
so he probably didnt update his income records and possibly causes the account to suspend?,btohqsg
That one is they ask regarding my credit card. But now my credit card still ongoing but uob one acct asked to close. I am expecting credit card will be affected next.,btohqsg
I have been transparent with this group all along.,btohqsg
I didn't. Weird. Any reason why?,btohqsg
Well wait till u r retired and has no more income documents to show r u going to tell all the banks that u have no more income and volunteer them to stop all your credit cards?,btohqsg
Obviously just keep quiet n continue to maximise for as long as possible,btohqsg
This is the end I guess,btohqsg
Young punks still earning salary obviously easy to provide income documents,btohqsg
Wait till u retire n u try to provide documents to justify 69k credit limit per card,btohqsg
