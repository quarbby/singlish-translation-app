"hi guys! i've been visiting singapore since wednesday and i've used a getgo car twice since then (from airport to my hotel on wednesday and a longer drive around singapore today)now they have suspended my account and are demanding that i pay a combined 800 sgd of ""clean up fees"" cause i smoked in the cars.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è does anyone have any idea if i can end up in trouble if i just ignore it and don't pay?",btohqsg
You can definitely end up in trouble,btohqsg
idiot. but he‚Äôs not a bot,btohqsg
welp. that's on you  you didn't read the T&Cs. ALL rentals are non smoking.,btohqsg
and yes you are liable and can be sued,btohqsg
but like how? they weren't able to charge my card and i'm leaving in three weeks,btohqsg
legal troubles are still a thing,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not a lawyer so i can‚Äôt advise,btohqsg
but just so you know  it‚Äôs extremely hard to win a case against a rental company,btohqsg
many have tried and many have failed,btohqsg
yeah i know they are but i didn't think i could really end up in trouble for smoking,btohqsg
you're visiting the one country that's known for fines,btohqsg
for sure they can't get me to court in three weeks,btohqsg
GetGo is very particular about who‚Äôs in the driver seat,btohqsg
To be fair emma  no obligation to pay if u not returning,btohqsg
oh but they sure as hell can find ways to get you to pay up,btohqsg
yeahhhhh i've found out by now üòÖ,btohqsg
up to you if you wanna run,btohqsg
i've heard of a couple cases where overseas authorities were contacted,btohqsg
exactly what i thought.. and like even if i return one day it's just a clean up fee from a random car rental company,btohqsg
that aside it's a moral thing,btohqsg
i'm more than certain getgo's T&Cs denote no smoking,btohqsg
you fucked up  you face the music imo,btohqsg
yeah i thought so but it's just their own rules and not the law,btohqsg
those driving today  take note high TP/LTA activity in north side üôèüèª,btohqsg
when rules are broken  it still means you are liable,btohqsg
you can get out of SG but if they do choose to persue it  which is definitely the most likely case  you might be double-fucked,btohqsg
Damn common china kids come US take credit card debt and spend the limit afterwards fuck right back to china,btohqsg
i'm sure telegrams t&cs say don't be an idiot but still this thing is full of idiots who get away with it üòÇ,btohqsg
once again  tourists disrespecting the rules,btohqsg
i‚Äôm so confused what you‚Äôre talking about now,btohqsg
Eh don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre all holy when you go into JB,btohqsg
you broke a ruleyou‚Äôre liable for paymentthey can seek the law because it‚Äôs an official signed contractwhat does that have to do with being an idiot?,btohqsg
i praise allah when i check my waze reports,btohqsg
but i don't think they will cause i don't live here,btohqsg
that is up to your own discretion,btohqsg
in the case they do pursue this case,btohqsg
you will need to fork out more  and if they do contact your local authoritiesthere will be more hassle,btohqsg
there have been 2 cases that i know of where they have.,btohqsg
one thai tourist and one american.,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a private company,btohqsg
you‚Äôre in Singapore  don‚Äôt rent cars here unless you want to be faulted for no reason,btohqsg
this is how they earn money,btohqsg
thai tourist had a damage fee of 1.8k  they had to pay 3k++ in the end,btohqsg
but i haven't caused any damage,btohqsg
tbvf cleaning fees if you return the cars nicely is around 20-30 bucks,btohqsg
you don't do that here unless you own it or the rules allow it,btohqsg
rules are rules  suck it up,btohqsg
HAHAHA I THOUGHT 800 WAS FIRST TIME,btohqsg
it doesn't cost them 800 to roll up the windows for a while and spray some air freshener..,btohqsg
