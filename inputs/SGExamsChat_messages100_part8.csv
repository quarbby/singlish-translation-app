My MIT Stanford huhvud friends ability rekt those in my school,btohqsg
HYPSM all should be first tier bah,btohqsg
I think largely influenced by their inadequacy in STEM ba,btohqsg
if you want talk about comp sci or engineering,btohqsg
Princeton more sciency but not CSy,btohqsg
berkeley can be considered first tier,btohqsg
Other than EECS they have nothing,btohqsg
yea their strengths are mainly in cs mah,btohqsg
That's why in CS the top school are mit Stanford cmu and ucb,btohqsg
But overall rep and ranking still only HSM,btohqsg
Oxbridge and the rest maybe second tier ba,btohqsg
But in terms of pure worth,btohqsg
I think nus ntu still best,btohqsg
the number of sg undergrads in HSM can probably be counted with both hands,btohqsg
While Oxbridge has 200 sgp a year,btohqsg
I almost ended up in Stanford,btohqsg
Tmr wait for ppl come flame me,btohqsg
anyone applied eae to Chinese study before ?,btohqsg
Did u do this when u were younger,btohqsg
Oh wait last seen 1 hr ago .-.,btohqsg
Oxford and Cambridge have a very long history together as rival unis  plus they are very similar  so people refer to them collectively,btohqsg
U can’t even apply to both unis at once,btohqsg
Because they’re so similar  one who applies to Cambridge would apply to Oxford too and vice versa  so each of them would have to deal with the admission workload of 2 unis,btohqsg
wait as in if you apply to one  youcan'tapply to the other?,btohqsg
So can just prevent people from selecting both unis as options,btohqsg
Probably need a lot of money to go this kind of uni lol,btohqsg
> imagine having such a strong rivalry that you don't even let students apply for the other school,btohqsg
imagine if u could only apply to NTU or NUS lol,btohqsg
It must be like hogwarts when you are a student in their campus lol,btohqsg
I believe the more practical reason is they don't want to double their workload,btohqsg
Cos their interviews are very intimate,btohqsg
Then if they want you and decide not to go,btohqsg
That's a damn waste of their time,btohqsg
That's why their yield rate is pretty high,btohqsg
Honestly if they allow ppl to apply for both,btohqsg
Their admission rate would half and that would make it as hard as Hahvud.,btohqsg
I thought the interview is purely academic,btohqsg
That would mean everyone from rj will get in wouldn't it,btohqsg
Still the rj admission rate is more like 1 in 4/5,btohqsg
For non stem 20k. Stem 30k,btohqsg
I want to smack myself for not choosing some easy humanities subject,btohqsg
JUST IN:Singapore reports 344 new COVID-19 cases  including 4 Singaporeans or permanent residents.The lower number is partly due to fewer tests being conducted  says the Ministry of Health.https://cna.asia/3gnYEf4,btohqsg

Altho i would want to go back tmr,btohqsg
