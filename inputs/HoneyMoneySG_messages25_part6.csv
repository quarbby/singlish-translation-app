I never realised that Trust Bank can withdraw with SoCash. Gonna be helpful üëç,btohqsg
I don't think can. But SCB can  and I suspect Trust bank just copy pasted the SCB exclusion list ü§£,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks for the info,btohqsg
Any credit card to recomend for wedding use?,btohqsg
Was considering between miles or cash back,btohqsg
Hahaha another payment scheme coming soon we already got so much fragmented payment,btohqsg
i got this too. I search tiger tele chat but cant find answer. Might need contact customer service,btohqsg
It's cbdc la. Not sure if it's a good thing. Can be made such that everything is extremely centralised and controlled,btohqsg
Not at the moment. I will steer clear from talking about individual stocks,btohqsg
I've also deleted messages related to the Kris+ referral. If you need a referral  please go tohttps://t.me/sgpromocode  this is my referral code page shared almost every other day.Please keep this main chat free from member's own referrals as this will degrade the quality of conversations and become a referral code exchange group.,btohqsg
i think it is better to use trust debit card withdraw fx money and paypass with amaze card.üòÅi heard trust debit card withdraw money oversea is very good rate.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any. Maybe there is minimum account maintenance amount,btohqsg
Hi gurus got a question  can amaze paired with citirewards be used for public transport to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
No for Revolution. Yes for the other 2  provided you pay on an ad-hoc basis and don't add the card for recurring payments,btohqsg
Is the OCBC 90N a good general spending miles card? Already have a crmc but have plans to get a couple of big ticket items that will exceed the 10x cap,btohqsg
no. nothing to do with krisflyer card.,btohqsg
But if apply krisflyer card also ok  can link,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone have any problem using Amaze linked to google pay for contactless? The card readers rejected my gpay multiple times  at different shops üò≠ P.S i did not make google pay my default app because I'm using samsung pay for as default  is it because of this?,btohqsg
Yeah happens a lot for me especially with the white POS machines in Malaysia. I just bring the physical card with me,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs amaze in general  I had to contact both the bank and amaze to get them to contact MC to allow my transactions to go through. Not sure which one did the trick  but gotta tell them which merchant.. so quite leh Cheh. Hard to do if you are in a physical store  it will take some time to clear,btohqsg
My physical card also declined at times,btohqsg
Okay  glad im not in the same boat haha! Yeah  i ended up using my physical card  but sometimes i kanchiong ah  then i use another credit card to pay üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
want to ask if for CRMC + Amaze for MCC 5814 ( Fast Food ) does it qualify for 4mpd ?,btohqsg
but this doesnt apply for 5812 ( Eating Place and Restuarnt right ) ?,btohqsg
it does. All mcc that is not excluded in TnC get 4mpd.,btohqsg
so basically the basic excluded ( insurance   hospital blah blah ) and TravelCIti TnC is not very well explained cause i keep looking at their provided MCC 10x Eligble Txn thinking only can use for those.thanks for the info,btohqsg
should look under the online portion of the TnC. Amaze converts all transactions to online  so all mcc eligible so long not excluded.,btohqsg
I'm keen to use Amaze  can I know if I can use amaze (link with CRMC) to input for payment of my recurring online subscription  which auto charged by merchant every month?,btohqsg
And would this then qualify as 10x point under CRMC?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Why not OCBC TR if the big ticket items are within the bonus category?,btohqsg
You ask me I ask who. T&Cs say so,btohqsg
Uob abs nerf grabpay. What will be next best option for ins prem without processing fees after Jan?,btohqsg
If Amex tcb got nerf then that is the last straw as now recently after start of 2023 even f&b zero points or no lucky draw too,btohqsg
Yeah could happen to tcb. What about ocbc get cashflo? Non ge product can ?,btohqsg
Why gst now 8%? Wah hahahaha,btohqsg
cos not online. must be online to get 4mpd for dbs wwmc or citi rewards for telco. Can use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard for recurring payment  will be converted to online,btohqsg
Hi guys  is the citybank cashback card able to get the 1.6% rebate by paying NUS school fee ?,btohqsg
Cannot  T&C excludes cashback for payment to educational institutions,btohqsg
Alright  think will just get UOB absolute cashback instead,btohqsg
Yep if Amex is accepted by NUS,btohqsg
Better check not all accept Amex,btohqsg
Feeek amex issued better overall vs uob amex,btohqsg
OIC. Myrepublic used to charge recurring as online  but they just changed payment vendor so dunno about now,btohqsg
Uob amex don't support mobile walletNo amex pay no amex app promotion & amex issued still can earn grab point,btohqsg
U mean the AMEX true cashback card better?,btohqsg
Got more perks over uob amex,btohqsg
for this does HSBC gives 4mpd for purchasing of gigabucks ?,btohqsg
May I know what's the amexpay promo now?,btohqsg
Amex Pay is a function in app it not a promo,btohqsg
