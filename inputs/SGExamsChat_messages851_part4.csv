semicon just feels like you pigeon hole yourself q a lot,btohqsg
like the starting pay is ok but the ceiling doesn't go super high either,btohqsg
I cant imagine a mundane job doing the same thing,btohqsg
i mean i have a few friends that went semicon,btohqsg
At least semicon R&D shldnt be that repetitive?,btohqsg
R&D side really depends bc a lot of companies leave that to higher degree holders,btohqsg

Depends what you want to do. Semiconductor is a giant pool of hot mess with niche fields,btohqsg

Overnight jobless.. ntuc also cannot step in,btohqsg

Basically is you need brain through and process what gibberish your colleagues say or other tech leads  and deliver the items to them ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
And 90 percent of the time is generate the files needed for execution ðŸ¥² if you not doing actual design work,btohqsg
Which takes up like half of your day.,btohqsg

I mean like day to day stuff,btohqsg
