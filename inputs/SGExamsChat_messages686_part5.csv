But mods r allowing her to literally get the attention of these creeps,btohqsg
But ofc if u put ur pic up there yall gonna get more creeps in ur dms,btohqsg
But shes a minor so she dont unds,btohqsg
Bro hes still in this gc ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Shes inviting creeps in her dms yes,btohqsg
But mods are allowing her to invite these creeps,btohqsg
why isn't there a doxxing rule here,btohqsg
Like dont do it here in sgexams gc bruv,btohqsg
bro it's encouraging the gc to expose peoples names,btohqsg
It's encouraging her to continue inviting creeps into her dms,btohqsg
You projecting your insecurities on someone?,btohqsg
Shes obv doing it for compliments,btohqsg
I thought it meant great Singapore sale,btohqsg
But this behaviour shdnt be allowed,btohqsg
honestly if matcha wants to send then send lah. got creeps on her dm. can js block and report and alert the admins here,btohqsg
end of the day if someone wants to send selfies of themselves  itâ€™s not against the rules and someone canâ€™t just assume intentions,btohqsg
plus sheâ€™s 16 and above which isnâ€™t a minor in sg,btohqsg
What else can her intention be by posing and talking a selfie,btohqsg
Displaying urself in a gc full of 20+ year olds,btohqsg
i mean iâ€™m not saying i agree with it but as far as moderation goes,btohqsg
u don't like her to send selfies u can honestly js leave the grp,btohqsg
Hi my name is bartholomew lll,btohqsg
ok lemme put it this way. for all intents and purposes sheâ€™s able to decide for herself. her selfies arenâ€™t rule breaking or an issue within itself but itâ€™s just not advised la. if people are straight up creeping here then itâ€™s separate matter. if people creep in dms then itâ€™s on her,btohqsg
sheâ€™s old enough to decide her own safety online,btohqsg
Bruh all this for a selfie,btohqsg
@IcedMilohi irwen if the selfies arent allowed lmk and i'll delete them,btohqsg
Bro how we gonna recognise you lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Unless youâ€™re like an influencer or smth I wonâ€™t be able to pick you out in public at all,btohqsg
omg i watched in pri sch,btohqsg
don't worry don't need selfie to get creeps in your DMs,btohqsg
most of the ppl who tell me got creep in their DM don't even have profile pic,btohqsg
im sure@aki923182appreciates your concern and I too appreciate your concern but as far as I'm concerned it doesn't break any rules,btohqsg
of course I do advice caution when sending anything that could expose your personal identity online but to each their own,btohqsg
my insta is damn public aso anw lel,btohqsg
thank youand yes i alr know the risks of sending selfies in a public gcbut as i have said  i treat this as any other social media - like instagram snapchat or tiktok. i understand that there is an inherent risk which comes with posting such selfies here,btohqsg
now what I don't understand is you choosing to make this assumption about my character. i feel like if you were truly concerned about my wellebing  you would dm me instead of making such comments in a public groupchat. did saying this make you feel morally superior?,btohqsg
i also watched  spirited away ponyo totoro,btohqsg
also as irwen said this   one can literally have default pic and creeps will still dm,btohqsg
Ik how kuro looks like but not me,btohqsg
I mean my pfp is anime girl also got creeps alrd,btohqsg
so you're implying that it's MY fault if i do get harassed ?,btohqsg
Me when someone asks me to hookup on instagram,btohqsg
my pfp is winnie the pooh someone asked me whether i wanted paid dates,btohqsg
my fren went to troll the person lol,btohqsg
"can i just say so many ""sugar mummy"" used to text me",btohqsg
u asking me if i want ah,btohqsg
but i want dual monitor arm,btohqsg
for single monitor abit meh honestly  for dual monitor or more makes more sense,btohqsg
depends on the space you have lor,btohqsg
i generally lean towards no if you have room,btohqsg
