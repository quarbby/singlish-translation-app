Coal futures dropped back below $170 per metric ton during the fourth week of August  but remained close to an all-time high of $173.4 hit earlier in the month  amid soaring electricity demand  infrastructure woes and a surge in global gas prices. A heat wave in Zhejiang  Jiangsu and Guangdong  China's biggest industrial provinces and a rebound in industrial output pushed demand higher despite governmentâ€™s pledge to cut carbon emissions. In the meantime  China authorized the restart of production for a year at 15 coal mines across northern provinces such as Shanxi and Xinjiang region as inventories declined to near historic lows since August due to peak summer electricity demand and transportation bottlenecks exacerbated by last month's severe floods and typhoon. Elsewhere  a trade spat with Australia has crimped imports while supplies remain limited by a closed mine in Colombia  flooding in Indonesia and Australia.,btohqsg
