Hi All  need some advise ..I'm going to pay $15k deposit for a car...which card is good to use for miles?,btohqsg
There's 2 options for you to choose... Co-ownership or sole ownership with essential occupier. There's absolutely no need for any justification required. Lol,btohqsg
for choc finance make sure you don't put more than 20k,btohqsg
else you can get negative returns on the additional amount that exceed 20k,btohqsg
so for sept  with additional 1% will be 4.3% if below $2 000 000?,btohqsg
Hi all  if im applying for UOB One card  how do I know whether im within the first 200 new to UOB credit card customers? Is it only after applying?Checking this as im signing up only due to the 350$ cash credit.,btohqsg
Does the first 200 have a min spending as well?,btohqsg
for mine in Dec 23 previously the promotion was 1st 200 to spend $1k in 2 consecutive months.Checked with uob staff that they will count for both months  from first day of card approval date  how long you take to spend $1k in both months  then sum the days of both months together and rank accordinglyEg.my card approval date is 2nd Dec23- I hit $1k spending in 5th Dec23  that’s 3 days- come jan24  I hit $1k spending in 4th jan24  which is 2 daysSo total I took 5 days then they will rank accordinglyHope that helps  alternatively you can confirm with UOB live chat/ staffs as well,btohqsg
You know if you get the reward or not. Or like what Jeremy said  check with CSO  but no guarantees they will actually know.,btohqsg
I read ML article that cashback trust is not good  so how that will work? Some more  we still can’t pay Trust with dbs cc pay bill,btohqsg
Read that article too. In my opinion  it was “not good” for optics. The cashback was not 15% as advertised in headline but closer to 4.1% at max capped at $2k monthly spending  with the cashback credited quarterly.,btohqsg
Up to individual to gauge if 4+% cashback is good or not,btohqsg
Correct to say it is the only cash back card with no foreign currency fees even if don’t meet quarterly spending?,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Can I confirm all uob card points can consolidate altogether and redeem in 1 transaction? Like uob preferred  lady’s card and Prvi  all the point will consolidate in a pool,btohqsg
Except UOB KF which go into KF directly.,btohqsg
Hi guys quick question  i want to apply for Standard Chartered Card to purely pay for my insurance premium  can i link through instarem amaze card  pay and get the cashback rewards?,btohqsg

hi  if i use POSB Everyday Card to pay for my telco bill  is it consider spending?,btohqsg

Hihi  if i add citi rewards to google pay and make payment  is it consider online payment? Thanks.,btohqsg
Oh...how about adding citi reward to shopback  also not consider online payment ya,btohqsg
Add to favepay is online payment,btohqsg
hi! any advice on which credit cards i should use to purchase flights? expecting to pay around 2500sgd,btohqsg
Think you should be fine if the total of ALL retail transactions on both cards exceed $500. Can correct me next month if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
I always thot dental is under MCC 5047 exclusion list,btohqsg
That works cuz i do that to pay.,btohqsg
does ocbc 365 card give cash rebates fortrip.comand SIA?,btohqsg
Medical  Dental  Opthalmic and Hospital *Equipment and Supplies*.You can always check the MCC before payment :),btohqsg
Hi i just finished utilising maybank’s isavvy high yield promo and scb’s yet to start. Why else can I place my excess cash?,btohqsg
this is exclusion from Instarem points (very hard to clock points to get $20  so can consider as neglible). Not excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi all  my friend wants to start collecting miles but doesn't want the hassle of tracking his expenditure. He is a UOB user and has the UOB one credit card  should I suggest him to swap to UOB preferred platinum as he mostly uses Applepay.In that case  does the UOB one card need to spend a minimum every month for him to keep the card?,btohqsg
If stick to Apple Pay only. Uob ppv is one of the easiest to earn 4mpdNo minimumMax $1110$5 blocks,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if buying the $128 adult concession will be considered a simplygo transaction & earn SCB smart card bonus points?,btohqsg
Apple Pay in-apps or Apple Pay paywave? Majority of transactions more than $5?,btohqsg
Sorry this is a silly question but do you ask the receptionist whats the mcc?,btohqsg
You need the Instarem app and the Instarem Amaze card. Set the payment source to Amaze Wallet with $0 inside  then pay with Amaze card. The transaction will fail  and you can check the MCC of the transaction in the Instarem Amaze app.,btohqsg
Hi all  my primary card is crmc+amazethinking of applying for a 2nd one incase it exceeds 1000 cap  should i go for uob lady’s or dbs womans world,btohqsg
Thanks for the information. I am going to US  hope it is included.,btohqsg
Are your spendings more online or offline? What do you usually spend on? Food/groceries/shopping etc.,btohqsg
food  grab  sometimes online shoppingand travelling like agoda/tickets but not often,btohqsg
If you can get UOB lady solitaire  I'd get that with dining and travel categories. If not  get dbs wwmc then put all online transactions on it and offline on crmc.,btohqsg
woman’s world points expire after 1 year. unless ur excess spending can hit $2500 spend within a year  lady’s/solitaire would be better,btohqsg
uob points also expires in 2 years am i right?,btohqsg
Yes. UOB has this AF mechanismhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/228701And uni$ pool so you can consider other UOB cards in the future.,btohqsg
Why need to hit $2500 within a year?,btohqsg
min 5000 dbs points for 10k miles,btohqsg
If expires and I convert to kfmiles  what is the validity afterwards?,btohqsg
so technically if i havent hit a decent amt of miles  i can transfer over to kf to accumulate it for 3 years before it expires right?,btohqsg
Anyone know if trust cashback card shopping category works for supermarkets?,btohqsg
sort of but should plan how to use the miles before it expires,btohqsg
