Hi everyone ive got a question regarding transferring usdr to a singapore bank account. Do pm me!,btohqsg
Once lock in  cannot top up more. Need create another portfolio. Cut off time should be 3pm,btohqsg
Recently  I got a few transactions on my credit card.The description isdcvsdt.com.I called uob and they advised the merchant is dating app.I don‚Äôt install dating apps. I‚Äôm an old auntie.Uob doesn‚Äôt seem to be helpful only offering stop the card and send me a new one.,btohqsg
Ask UOB if you can chargeback the transaction? Sounds like your card details got stolen by scammers,btohqsg
Sorry got a dumb questionLet's say I got UOB Evol  ppv  krisflyer card of 2k credit limit eachIs there an overarching credit limit for my UOB account? Let's say it's 3kThen I can't charge 2k per card  yes?,btohqsg
Context :I called uob hotline because I have more than 5 uob cc for different purposesSuddenly all cannot charge even though I haven't hit my 2k/card limitThe bank told me there's a credit limit shared by all cards,btohqsg
Yes for UOB it‚Äôs one limit that‚Äôs shared among their cards. Different policy per bank (Amex is independent limit per card for example),btohqsg
I see. Felt so dumb because I never had this issue with other banks hahaTo safeguard my cards  I tend to keep my credit limit low to prevent big fradulant chargesSo for uob  I can technically increase my account limit to a big figure  but keep the limit of individual cards low?,btohqsg
Because some cards like uob absolute cashback Amex I only use a few times a year  big amount  for donations. A bit Sian to keep changing the limit for both the card and account,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I am planning to set USD X amount monthly DCA into VWRA on IBKR. So I will need to set up recurring SGD Y amount bank transfers for funding. I would like to check on the following:1) Assuming my monthly DCA is 5th of every month  which recurring bank transfer date should I fix?2) How do i determine the amount of SGD to transfer  since the exact SGD Y amount required to convert to USD X is not known?Thanks!,btohqsg
This is because UOB pools all your miles together.,btohqsg
Not sure what you mean by ‚Äúaccount limit‚Äù  are you referring to how much you can cash transfer (like paynow  FAST)? If so then yes you can control that independently to credit limitIf you have large payment coming up you can always send an overpayment to the card then it‚Äôll increase the spending power temporarily just for that purchase,btohqsg
Oh no haha I meant overall credit limitBecause on the app & Ibanking I can see my individual card limitsBut not this 'overall limit'Ya noted on the overpaying. Used that long ago for student ccs with fixed credit limit of $500,btohqsg
Not necessarily true as a general rule  for example OCBC‚Äôs cards have different points currencies but the credit limit is pooled,btohqsg
The limit applied to my uob cashback cards too (my cashback cards also got declined on charging) so I think this pooling of miles has no relation to the credit limits,btohqsg
Haha I referring to the name ZYM not bank,btohqsg
Is this one? I am also curious to know if it‚Äôs safe. Those that signed up  pls share üòÄ,btohqsg
Haha.. the person name in this group too,btohqsg
Fraudulent transactions on credit card are easily refunded. The moment the transaction is made  just report to the bank. They will immediately freeze the card and provide replacement. The refund will then be processed in a few weeks after their investigation.,btohqsg
Basically what they do for this is they take up a bank FD for you.,btohqsg
But just that the bank give them a better rate so you get it too. So basically only bank risk?,btohqsg
I also kept my credit limit low also to prevent fraud tooAnd also doesn‚Äôt really make sense for me to have a high credit limit considering EVOL doesn‚Äôt have much use for a high credit limit.Anyway UOB shares credit limit among all the cards  for HSBC  it seems to be individual for me  at least for my advance and revolution card which I get 2k each separately,btohqsg
They will investigate it for you lol. Just report immediately when the transaction is made.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows which miles card to use for EV charging? Mainly SP and comfort delgro chargers TIA,btohqsg
I put in money 3 months ago  I get back the deposited sum + interest.Straight forward,btohqsg
Sounds good. I probably will keep a low limit on my Evol then haha additional security. The mile cards are for my spillovers,btohqsg
It‚Äôs immediate liao leh. The person I chatted with me didn‚Äôt mention about investigating and refund. Maybe I should ask again.,btohqsg
Yeah  I have abt 2-3 cards which I use  but mostly they are just really about 2-3k kinda credit limit.,btohqsg
I never see before cards in the same bank have individual credit limits tho.. would be nice to have such feature hahaha,btohqsg
Did you tell them it's fraudulent?,btohqsg
So far it‚Äôs ok. Got a couple of payouts and reinvested le,btohqsg
Oh have to be done on the website.. their website is just horrible to navigate lol I only used it to set alerts and never again open it. Anyway UOB TMRW can do temporary increase of credit limit so maybe if got any purchases in the near future can do that.,btohqsg
Jus tried. This is for increasing limit temporarily. Cant lower it.,btohqsg
Only for specific stuff. Not daily use haha,btohqsg
I don't think they actually limit right.. just putting reason only ü§î,btohqsg
What's the good platform and method to pay for JR regional pass? I have HSBC Revolution (travel exclusion from 2024)  UOB KF and UOB One card,btohqsg
If under 1k then I think u can buy with hsbc revo now. 4mpd right?Above 1k then maybe uob kf since uncapped. But lower at 3mpd,btohqsg
Hi All  i need some advices on what card to apply other than uob cards for travel spending like booking hotels and purchasing stuffs from klook for Japan‚Äôs trip. I‚Äôm currently holding citi rewards and i have applied amaze card ad well.,btohqsg
If not travelling often  probably go with new card with good sign up reward as new to bank customer. Temporarily charge any eligible spend on it.,btohqsg
I have Citi rewards + Amaze combo If I am at a restaurant and it allows me to key in credit card details through the online payment page in the phone  do I use my Amaze or Citi rewards cc to earn miles?,btohqsg
Yes. For 2 pax  less than 1k.Is Klook the best? Palego isnt any cheaper even with SIA booking reference number as promo code,btohqsg
pre pay via website  payment on app are considered online payments.If only option is to pay via contactless or card. Then must Amaze card. If dining place is located in hotel. Then likely don't have bonus point even if use Amaze card. Check on HeyMax for details,btohqsg
So if it‚Äôs PayWave  I use Amaze card  I earn Citi milesIf it‚Äôs restaurant (non travel related just normal restaurant) online payment enter credit card details  i use Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Btw I just saw there‚Äôs a cap of 9000 points being awarded to Citi rewards points  means if I spend more than $900  doesn‚Äôt make sense to use this card cos no miles earned  correct?,btohqsg
max $1k for 9x bonus points in a statement month,btohqsg
just make this mistake of crediting 2k to citi rewards üò≠Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è wasted,btohqsg
Can I check if u tried this promo code? Was the discount cash back to UOB card on the following month or the discount was presented in the payment stage during the booking?,btohqsg
If I have already converted to Rm  is there additional charge when I used it got touch and go wallet?,btohqsg
Any guru can advise on this? üòä,btohqsg
You must switch to the debit feature. If left in credit card feature  it will be cash advance at 27% EIR,btohqsg
