"I see  thanks@ChrisHMSG!Also  I saw under the eligible spending  there's the ""Insurance payments made on a recurring basis on selected credit or debit cards""Does anyone know what are the selected cards?",btohqsg
Will I switch to Trust/YouTrip after this Instarem Amaze Nerf?https://youtu.be/SD6tWW0euTg,btohqsg
Or any of these cards works?,btohqsg
Hbsc revolution or Citi rewards for no minimum spending,btohqsg
dbs wwmc and uob lady (dining category) also can,btohqsg
Best way to convert USD to SGD using Business Account?,btohqsg
Hi fellow masters  two quick questions:a) when does the citi rewards $1k cap on 10x points Renew itself? On 1st of each calendar month  or depends on when your card is activated?,btohqsg
b) do any of you use citi pay all? What are the costs involved? And still worth to use if for example I've already maxed out the $1k cap on 10k points?,btohqsg
so is it right to conclude for citi premiermiles linked with amaze  1.25cpm*1.2 miles per dollar = about 1.5% cashback  after accounting for fx spread ~2% and amaze nerf  won’t be really worth it vs youtrip/trust?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask if the internet for sat and sun for moo moo cash plus will be credit on Monday? I didn’t receive on weekend but I receive the interest on Monday but it seem like it was only Monday interest. Do the moomoo cash plus earn interest on weekend too?,btohqsg
hi  can I ask for instarem amaze  if I spend in the month of June  when will I receive my instarem amaze points,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering for uob lady's card  the t&c mentioned that it excludes AMAZE*TRANSIT. But your recent video mentioned that uob lady's card is able to use amaze. So wanna confirm whether we are able to use the uob lady's card on amaze.,btohqsg
Correct. Only use 4mpd / 5% cashback and above cards on amaze,btohqsg
2.2% on paid amount  separate cap,btohqsg
immediate. no receive = not qualified,btohqsg
So every weekend interest is only in on Tuesday?,btohqsg
"This question has been asked many times. Short answer is yes. long answer can search ""amaze transit""",btohqsg
What merchant did you spend it on? and how did you pay,btohqsg
I spend it through Google pay (linking Google pay to my amaze card),btohqsg
only Foreign currency merchants earn 0.5% instapoints (1 Aug onwards). watch my latest video today,btohqsg
Ok wait so for local spending I don't earn any instapoints?,btohqsg
What is the best card mile to use for geneco bill payment?,btohqsg
Only the 4 mile per dollar?,btohqsg
Hi  what do you mean by separate cap??? Meaning unlimited 10x points if using citi pay all + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Does it also mean  it won't be worth to use citi pay all + citi cash back as it only gives back 1.6%  whilst you pay 2.2%?,btohqsg
FCY spend only ~ local spending earn nothing on amaze,btohqsg
Yup  people pay to buy miles with citipayall,btohqsg
Thanks  so what cards would be good to pair with citi payall? Since citi rewards only gives 4mpd up to $1k  whilst things like rent / insurance / tax usually cost a lot more?,btohqsg
Can I use Google pay linked to amaze card with CRMC? Or do I need to use the physical amaze card?,btohqsg
can use googlepay also for merchants that allow payment via googlepay,btohqsg
citi payall does not give 4mpd. At most 2.2mpd now under the promo which needs min $8k payall payment by 20 Aug. Best to pair with citi prestige or citi premiermiles where miles dun expire,btohqsg
yup no instapoints but can get 4mpd on crmc for a wide range of mcc (less travel related and the common exclusions) regardless of payment mode.,btohqsg
imo btc and eth yes  but still prepare yourself for mad volatility,btohqsg
Citi rewards will cap at 1k?,btohqsg
Thanks a lot. Sadly just paid up a big chunk of my insurance already so won't hit the 8k :(,btohqsg
Anyone can invite me Giga 4th anniversary promotion?,btohqsg
May I kindly know after 20 Aug promo  what cards would be best paired with citi payall then? Thank you,btohqsg
Excess cash from UOB one account where can I park the cash in bank for more interest,btohqsg
if uob one account opened middle of the month after salary credited already means no interest for the month?,btohqsg
it takes the daily average balance,btohqsg
OCBC 360?  even though there is not spend or salary credit?,btohqsg
oh then GXS (5k)  UOB Stash (100k)  remaining in MariBank and Trustbank,btohqsg
as in to qualify for the bonus interest*,btohqsg
if your amount is high enough until the daily average balance meets the criteria,btohqsg
mid month still quite easy to meet. just need 200k,btohqsg
for salary credit  is there any oneself pay oneself hack for DBS / OCBC?,btohqsg
Is there a good cashback card to pair with xnap?,btohqsg
uob evol 6.67%  citi cashback 6%,btohqsg
Oh wow citi cashback is 6%?,btohqsg
yes need min $800 monthly spend though,btohqsg
