worst case scenerio what do do if fail emath ah :(,btohqsg
Hmmm how about Th Nth term,btohqsg
Remember the bell curve for e math is rly high need to get like 90% for A1,btohqsg
Last year schools a1 rate was 90%,btohqsg
So prelim unless the sch paper is damn hard distinction rate would almost certainly fall,btohqsg
i was hesistant about putting empty brackets or,btohqsg
U wont fail. If u know u Revised then u wont,btohqsg
can i put it as { },btohqsg
I put O with a slash,btohqsg
but i ended up putting this {},btohqsg
Anyone got the pdf file for emaths paper?,btohqsg
âˆ… or {} should be accepted,btohqsg
But sadly because I put {âˆ…} I will probably lose one mark,btohqsg
but i failed for prelims : ),btohqsg
So u die p1 p2 do well,btohqsg
For my school for o levels,btohqsg
I put o slash anyway tho LOL,btohqsg
Btw how you know the A1 rate is 90% I thought schools would normally disclose distinction rate only which includes A2,btohqsg
But wat if u combine lol,btohqsg
My Cher say in some lvl briefing,btohqsg
Ur cher maybe trying to scare u,btohqsg
The other subjects distinction rate not very good,btohqsg
Likely cannot I heard itâ€™s mathematically wrong,btohqsg
Even my sch Amath 95% A not 95% A1,btohqsg
Its eithr O with slash or Empty bracket,btohqsg
Is it 2 to the power of ten or 32 squared,btohqsg
A lot of ppl do 32^2,btohqsg
But they ask for 2 no?,btohqsg
They probably thought they wanted a power of 2 for the base,btohqsg
did yall get - 24.something for completing square,btohqsg
"they said "" as a power of 2""",btohqsg
Ye so as a power of 2,btohqsg
Thats as a power of 32,btohqsg
Yeah so that must have confused people itâ€™s actually 2^10,btohqsg
This will become an element alrd,btohqsg
i was hfrjjjs changing it soo many timesss,btohqsg
got ppl ans sheet on reddit,btohqsg

I hope for 13b they accept +_ square root 4-0.25y,btohqsg
I bet a fair bit of people didnâ€™t put plus minus,btohqsg

Iâ€™m pretty sure u need put percentage tbh,btohqsg
