balancing and alignment got any difference?,btohqsg
Balancing is put weights on the wheel to make the wheel CG balanced.,btohqsg
Alignment is the position of all 4 wheels relative to the chassis.,btohqsg
Do alignment if your tyre wear uneven or your steering wheel doesn't return center when driving straight,btohqsg
But always good to do alignment once in a while,btohqsg
Because if you hit potholes can make it run,btohqsg

By right dealers should do alignment before handover  but a lot of them just act blur if buyer never request,btohqsg
