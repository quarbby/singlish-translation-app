call your credit card bank CSO if you already have transaction from the instalment.,btohqsg
I'm thinking of applying for the Amex Highflyer card  is there a thread that discuss us this card? I curious if I can use it to pay income tax.,btohqsg
Income tax generally speaking are excluded across most / all cards. I don‚Äôt think highflyer will be any different.,btohqsg
Does IRAS accept payment using Amex?,btohqsg
The wedding planner provided the MCC 7011  so this is not considered as a monthly instalment right?,btohqsg
You mention instalment is because you are planning to pay the wedding in instalments or what? Because if so  no matter the MCC  it is considered an instalment. A bit confusing,btohqsg
I believe this is a private instalment arrangement between the hotel/restaurant and you. The transaction is considered a hotel expenses.Then you can check with the hotel/restaurant if you pay the bill in full using NETS  can they give you 8% or 10% discount  with that it can give you more saving compare to credit card cashback.If you can‚Äôt pay in full n need the private instalment arrangements   pls read this‚Ä¶.https://youtu.be/ZhpIF6v8K6UPls check the bank credit card website for latest update before making payment as some info may have outdated. Eg. DBS Altitude 3mpd.,btohqsg
I mention instalment because I asked if I can pay a monthly amount in advance prior to the wedding date  they said can and they can provide up to four links to make payments,btohqsg
Oh ok. So not a bank-partnered instalment plan  rather it‚Äôs a retailer instalment payment plan. Then it should be eligible,btohqsg
I believe it is a private instalment arrangement. I can try to ask if there is any benefits to pay in full using NETS. Thanks for the tip,btohqsg
Yes it is not a bank-partnered instalment plan  thanks for clearing that up for me,btohqsg
Hi  may I ask if the Moo Moo NDP promotion for the guaranteed 5.8% is paid out daily? For 80k does it mean that I will receive $12.71 on a daily basis or I will receive 3.8219% now and at the end of 30 days then Moo moo will top up the difference?,btohqsg
hi folks - how long does UOB require to process credit card application,btohqsg
in this era where credit card can be approved instantly with MyInfo - this is a big shame on UOB,btohqsg
Iras does not accept credit card payments but you can pay through AXS,btohqsg
As a fresh new UOB customer  this was my experience.New UOB One Account - Instant approvedNew UOB EVOL Card - Less than 12 hours approvedUOB EVOL Card delivered to address - Within 5 working days in letterbox,btohqsg
Uob evol card is best for?,btohqsg
U did it on a weekday?,btohqsg
My One account also instant but just applied my EVOL not sure when will approve...,btohqsg
UOB can approve credit card application instantly if the applicant meet the criteria. My  UOB credit card was approved instantly. If the applicant background cannot fully meet the requirements  they need backend office staff the review manually.,btohqsg
Yup. I did it on a Thursday evening after working hours,btohqsg
Does AXS accept payment using Amex card?,btohqsg
Alrights shall see tomorrow if there are any updates,btohqsg
Did they ask if you want delivery of self pick-up?,btohqsg
Credit cards don't have the option...,btohqsg
Oh I see  sorry haven't applied for any before... Thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
Then this might be the cause of delay like what Mouse Hunter said. If you meet criteria and have a proper credit score  it's pretty likely you will get it approved almost instantly.,btohqsg
I do have a sub card under uob though... Does that count to the credit score?,btohqsg
Agree  I think UOB does lag behind other banks in terms of credit cards. Not sure why  this is just my personal experience,btohqsg
Interesting. Personal experience is that my first credit card with upb was approved within 1 day. The 2nd one was automatic approval,btohqsg
I assume that 1st one took longer because new to bankBut I have heard from self employed friends with very good iras pay slips that have their applications rejected or take super long,btohqsg
For Shein vouchers  can we get 4mpd using CRMC ?,btohqsg
Hi community MCC 4812  have a large upcoming transaction of over 10k  can't seem to find a card on heymax that provide reasonable Cashback or miles for the entire amount.Hoping for 3%/3mpdand above for Cashback  milesMay I seek advice from the community here. Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi  how long does HSBC require to process credit card application,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hard to say the best  everyone are different,btohqsg
Mine was approved within a day. Apply via uob app,btohqsg
What is sub card? Supplement card?,btohqsg
But in term of volume of customer  probably they should be in top 3  along with Citi and dbs,btohqsg
Sc Manhattan  but not sure what is 4812  if they‚Äôre excluded,btohqsg
But Manhattan no longer available for new customer and max only 6600$,btohqsg
Sure I can use card up and other similar methods  but you need to pay for the miles that way right? I read that with Amex Highflyer you can pay for income tax without any cost. But they have stopped giving miles for grab pay top up  which I think effectively removed the method of payment of tax through AXS.,btohqsg
This card is best for nearly everything we spend online and contactless. Do note the definition of contactless for UOB Evol is Mobile Contactless which require customer to add the card to their phone e-wallet (i.e. ApplePay or GooglePay).,btohqsg
If your tax is 100k  maybe should just ask UOB RM to apply the Reserve card for you? I'm sure they can push through for your card application.,btohqsg
Hi morning  which credit card best to use to buy monthly concession pass on simply go app ?,btohqsg
If your $100k income come from full time employed or self employed  commission based  rental income or dividend or business ?,btohqsg
