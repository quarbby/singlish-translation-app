Certain people have immunity I tell you,btohqsg
Actually is sienta better or wish?,btohqsg
i prefer the wish but sienta has sliding doors,btohqsg
If you prefer a station wagon body style and the 3rd row is seldom used  go for the wish,btohqsg
Which is now the Prius plus,btohqsg
If you prefer a tall body style  sliding doors and would be using the 3rd row a fair bit  go for the sienta,btohqsg
Power figures are roughly the same but the previous sienta hybrid came with a 1.5 while the Prius+ (wish replacement) comes with the Prius 1.8 hybrid powertrain,btohqsg
Will u do a review soom,btohqsg
Oh frequent usage of 3rd row  the preferred choice is actually sienta ah? Okay,btohqsg
Yes as there's more knee room and leg room in the sienta's 3rd row and you still get some boot space,btohqsg
