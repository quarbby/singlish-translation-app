Hello. I tried paying with googlepay before and notice not all flight works for googlepay. Was trying to fly with SQ from SG to south Korea  return. It only works if you are flying out of singapore. Doesn't work for return. That was a year ago. But i might change. Perhaps you might want to check manual. You should be able to see in the payment option.,btohqsg
