"‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update- Oct 29 2021‚úàÔ∏èüöôFord: Truly an UnderdogüõªIn our daily update on 10 September  we have painted a bring spot for Ford. The company had delivered a robust quarter eating with beats in profit projection. Moreover  the raising of full-year profit guidance brings a smile to the investors.A piece of more delightful news is the return of quarterly dividends. Earnings per share rocket 51 cents compared to an estimate of 27 cents. The CEO also conveyed the successful company navigation in chip shortages and Covid-19 woes. There is the expectation for production to recover strongly as more parts become available. The idea is to replenish stocks in the dealer inventory.Nonetheless  the shift towards paying out dividends evokes confidence and strongly signals the enormous improving business sentiments and the ability to fund investment in its EV plan.Pika World maintains a positive outlook on the stock consistent with our prior feature of the company prospect.üì±Apple: Supply Issues Woes‚è≥The much-anticipated earnings result is here. Unfortunately  the company earnings result fell short of expectation as the CEO Tim Cook signals a more pronounced problem in supply constraints. However  earnings per share were in line with expectation  and revenue was lighter at $83.3.6 billion compared to estimates of $84.85 billion.The bright spot lies in services revenue which rose 25.6% compared to a year ago despite a less rosy revenue from iPhone. Since the onset of the pandemic  Apple has not provided earnings guidance. The company is still expecting a robust December quarter that is likely to hit a record.It is perhaps the first quarter Apple had missed estimates since April 2016  but Pika World remains hopeful that the company will register a firmer outlook ahead once supply constraints fade.üíéLucid: A Rare Gem being PolishedüíéDelivery is set to start on 30 October  and this provides good sentiments for the shares. It is expected to deliver around 520 vehicles. The price tag is a wow as the Air ""Dream Edition"" costs a whopping $170 000 for its base model.Lucid has shown remarkable progress in the execution of plans  and Pika World maintains optimism about the company's outlook.ü©∫Teladoc: A stock that Pains UsüíäThe company is Pika World's favourite. While it forms a tiny fraction of our portfolio  we believe its performance has been underappreciated. Third-quarter saw a net loss of $84.3 million which is smaller than expected.For the past three earnings reports  the stock had always fallen after the announcement of results. Paid membership had risen by 2% on a yearly growth rate which is consistent with estimates. In addition  the total visits hit 3.9 million  which smashed the target of 3.5 million.Pika World continues to monitor the company's progress as we are hopeful that its services will continue to be in demand even in a post-pandemic world.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive Personal Spending data  which we expect moderation to 0.5% from 0.8% in the prior period.It is Oct 29  Friday  at 7.02 am in Singapore and 7.02 pm in New York. It is the last trading of the month  and we hope all friends of Pika World a Moonatic day.",btohqsg
Yup üëç hope Asiatic is ready. They went from 10/11 to 6/7 where it based out with no liquidity and now back to 8The liquidity in this counter mainly is above $0.008 especially since Mr Neo came in as SSH this year at $0.008If BBs really want play this  they must push to above $0.009/$0.010   then more market participation comes,btohqsg
Since we are at the month‚Äôs end today  zoomed into Asiatics monthly chart.Analysis1) Big spike in volume in Jan 2021 which was when Neo Garden boss came in as SSH at $0.008. In that period  price went up to $0.0112) After the spike up in Jan21  the counter have some what went to limbo and bottomed out at $0.006/$0.007 where it was supported by the green uptrend Line still.3) Recently  counter started coming alive too and today being month end  I don‚Äôt see how it will close $0.007 at all. I believe today will be the 1st time where monthly will close above this year downtrend line.I would say $0.008 should be good to collect in case some flushing comes along to Shake off weak hands at here before their upcoming test of the resistance at $0.010.4) Recently seems to be gaining traction with QT moving and maintaining at $0.006/$0.007 and CSC moving up 3 pips too yesterday before closing at $0.013DYODD and OTOT. Market can turn and we have to react always,btohqsg
