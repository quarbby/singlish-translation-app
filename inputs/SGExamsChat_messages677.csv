oh yea i missed the phd app for nus (cqt),btohqsg
I still rmb how I am like omg I score 78 points and then all my bunkmates score 80-90 rps,btohqsg
see you in harvard for postdocs,btohqsg
bold of you to assume i'm staying in academia,btohqsg
dont compare  as long as you are happy with ur results,btohqsg
''how do you make something less special? By comparing it with something else'',btohqsg
meanwhile me: omg i didn't fail anything how sia,btohqsg
and funny actually i scored exactly what i had hoped for,btohqsg
im glad i didnt score what i expected 💀,btohqsg
in prelims i only passed GP and physics,btohqsg
so i'm glad i didn't get what i expected either,btohqsg
i expected lower but scored my target in the end (tbh after As i tot it was not gonna happen),btohqsg
btw so how did the interview thing go LOL,btohqsg
wow prelims i think i only passed h2 chem and h2 physics (?),btohqsg
Oh it was ok uh  i got in the astar internship,btohqsg
and y3s in MI only need to study gp + 3h2 so i dk what i was doing then,btohqsg
yes im a try hard crazy mugger in jc  suddenly got a loading dose of motivation,btohqsg
Actually i had to select btw 2 projecrs,btohqsg
mfw when i had a nyjc bunkmate who got 90rp + H3 physics distinction,btohqsg
wait is it under the ARIA thing,btohqsg
and im here like oh hey i passed A levels,btohqsg
at 1 point i legit just ''wait im trying so hard for what'',btohqsg
I almost thought you refering to wh 😂😂,btohqsg
i was really sad i fell below 80 in prelims actually (coz my practical pulled me down coz i got a D for it)  this was where my chem cher told me just focus on theory  coz my practical really cmi,btohqsg
im fine with full uniform also,btohqsg
yea it was just my crazy expectations,btohqsg
hmm imre i only know johnson goh,btohqsg
actually when i read my personal statement  the english a bit not right sia,btohqsg
i didnt know we have so many people suffering from success here,btohqsg
Oh I am suffering all right,btohqsg
only astar russian i sorta know is kuznetsov,btohqsg
i dont even mind wearing tie everyday,btohqsg
i wore sch uniform with tie everyday in sec sch,btohqsg
wait is your thing under aria,btohqsg
for poly medical check up which clinics have all the equipment does anybody know,btohqsg
lower sec tie and shorts damn funny lmao,btohqsg
then sec1s first time wearing tie  then some fella tie only half his shirt  like small tie HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
if your face handsome  anything can,btohqsg
mine full white then maroon tie,btohqsg
I mean  can wear make up,btohqsg
you got big eyes small face,btohqsg
lysosome fuse with phagocytic vesicles to release hydrolytic enzymes within vesicles,btohqsg
on monday during morning assembly only friday wear class tee,btohqsg
This looks like they are emphasising on those that get S And U instead of A and B,btohqsg
I have the one for the sciences uh,btohqsg
Some not allowed to use phone during results release,btohqsg
This one is for J1 MYE not the A level one,btohqsg
What kind of draconian school does this,btohqsg
Tbh I prefer Ms Neo over Mr de silva,btohqsg
Idk after he gave the speech on how he promoted schools to have lightning alerts  he give me very odd vibes,btohqsg
not during the whole results release only when they were showing statistics of the whole cohort 😁,btohqsg
Actually how were the results tho,btohqsg
Aww poor thing  but ntu accepted you cus we accept everybadi :D,btohqsg
percentage of those who pass for subject is not very high,btohqsg
Dang. No wonder they not showing.,btohqsg
Luckily i was in the era where I can do 2 ccas,btohqsg
Well if including tdp then maybe 3.,btohqsg
Jacob Baker  your message was deleted,btohqsg
Can’t really see some area cuz the door is locked,btohqsg
But I don’t see any benches sia,btohqsg
Then it’s not so bad I guess,btohqsg
Only thing is that it’s closed,btohqsg
Theg juz showed the sch this,btohqsg
Maybe even yi performance is better than this?,btohqsg
I would think yi median is at least 67.5  and given the MI slide which says “almost half the students scored UAS of 67.5 or above” MI median should be just below 67.5,btohqsg
I was absent when pw groups was released then i heard fr my friend that there is this girl who was initially in my grp but insisted to trf coz she has got sth against me (actually me too she is so LOUD even she kena on mj confession someone say she laugh like a horse). Then ended up my grp kena this girl who dun even turn up for sch apparently hv an illness then withdrew after promos and apparently came back a yr later lmao,btohqsg
My bro said he receiving pw groups sometime this week,btohqsg
My whole group is so quiet😢My clique split like 2-2-1 and i was the 1 who ended up in another grp:-(,btohqsg
How u know the rank point cut off? I tot all the UAS in grades form,btohqsg
I tot SMU known for biz and econs  and hv highest grad employment? Coz of the seminar teaching style and class part,btohqsg
Econs is a sci at smu?? LMAO,btohqsg
Wot??? Iirc biz is one of the courses that u can get in by rp and my 2 friends got in below 85 (idk low 80s or high 70s i ps ask ppl how they did coz I scored quite high),btohqsg
Same i just wanna stay afloat and graduate w honors,btohqsg
But 3y is it still hons or no,btohqsg
I only hv 9 non cores,btohqsg
I got C for 3 / 4 cores i think,btohqsg
Wah i think nbs’ selling point,btohqsg
I see some of my batch already grad,btohqsg
Oh right is it q bad,btohqsg
I was gonna rso for fever yesterday  but my fever suddenly gone 😔,btohqsg
I actually miss wearing sch uniform,btohqsg
Wow nice  better than yi which had no 90rp this year,btohqsg
How often does mi have 90rp tho,btohqsg
Should be more often than yi I suppose?,btohqsg
Congrats to that student I guess,btohqsg
Trying to see which sch has better results,btohqsg
But honestly no clue since don’t have a lot of stats,btohqsg
My friend fr yi said need luck to get 90rp there,btohqsg
Only know that yi only one 90rp since 2019,btohqsg
oh btw @ ppl who did pw,btohqsg
did you guys hear of the thing where you can write 1 person udw to work with on a paper and give to teacher,btohqsg
cause my friend said their jc have this but idk if all jc have or is just that particular jc,btohqsg
I think it varies between JCs but in general ppl should be able to complain,btohqsg
then the cher group all those people who no one wants to work with together,btohqsg
The Pw teacher will try mediate between the students but if cannot then will escalate further,btohqsg
Can go all the way up to the principal if very serious,btohqsg
i dont know how to do long division properly,btohqsg
Kinda rare ig but it still happens,btohqsg
Back then in 2019 we had one iirc,btohqsg
Seems that it happens a bit more frequently than in yi  because yall had at least 2 since 2019 whereas yi only had 1,btohqsg
I don’t rly have any hard evidence to back it up but then it would mean that mi results are better than yi,btohqsg
But i think hor now that i realise right,btohqsg
Well here is the thing  1/3 is possible for our era,btohqsg
They stated before during our promo results,btohqsg
I don’t get why not moe just make yi a 3 year course sch,btohqsg
(The half of the half is advanced),btohqsg
I think is skewed because it doesnt include those who retook,btohqsg
Advanced is like conditional promotion I guess,btohqsg
Promoted means your grades make it,btohqsg
Advanced means your grade cmi but they allow you to go j2,btohqsg
i joked w gf that i wanted broccoli instead if flowers,btohqsg
The yijc gym looks more emptier for some odd reason,btohqsg
They always say  a 西兰花 is still a 花.,btohqsg
What is the TV for?  😁,btohqsg
I think Acjc has the biggest gym among all the JCs but most of the equipment inside is outdated,btohqsg
A lot of them are from the mid 90s when the sports complex was built,btohqsg
Last he talked to me was Tuesday,btohqsg
Maybe when u fail PR can throw a plate onto the screen to vent out ur anger,btohqsg
now is chem lecture (i totally did not escape),btohqsg
you want ur chem to become like mine ah,btohqsg
Jc can js skip lesson ah,btohqsg
Js be lowkey in class isit,btohqsg
ite oso can pon poly oso can pon,btohqsg
also someone on telegram recognised me irl,btohqsg
"she legit asked me ""are you the person in the telegram chat""",btohqsg
i mean i wearing similar outfit today to my dp pic,btohqsg
but you still got A 🤡,btohqsg
I love ur dp sm its so cute 😭😭,btohqsg
I realised 3/4 of my h2s are yapping subjects,btohqsg
U made me believe that chem was gonna be 90 marks for A,btohqsg
yo u can't blame me man,btohqsg
I see ppl everything answer correctly,btohqsg
then I see my answer Idk wtf they saying,btohqsg
the teacher teach v slow for chem,btohqsg
i think early topics not that hard to self learn anyway,btohqsg
the topic jn ip learn alr,btohqsg
Fk u la u see my paper 2,btohqsg
my time all IP so idk the pace now,btohqsg
i filled in all the blanks myself,btohqsg
my friend thought he would rush but he ended up being so slow 😭,btohqsg
take this time to read up on the other topics then,btohqsg
oh I usually do the tutorials or qns at the back if the teacher is too slow,btohqsg
i've been doing this since y3 lol,btohqsg
walao you see ppl like me in Chem struggling to make ends meet,btohqsg
in jh if you sleep they call you out,btohqsg
my way is i read ahead 10 pages and if im satisfied that i get it,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
so low budget one this sch,btohqsg
tm gym looks way better yhan yi gym btw,btohqsg
how could you  yi has the best gym in the world!!,btohqsg
WAIT BMEH IS A LEGIT COMBO,btohqsg
u again with ur that one,btohqsg
why are yi ppl so quiet bruh,btohqsg
they allow weird ass combi one,btohqsg
Why wud u ever do that to urself,btohqsg
got a girl in my class taking h2 cll,btohqsg
and then my friend taking h2 cse,btohqsg
Ngl for all of its flaws,btohqsg
One of its smallest One is ej restricting subject combis,btohqsg
bro i dont even take a math n purw sci,btohqsg
Fml i dunno if i studying or fadai-ing si,btohqsg
im literally strugglinf with basic a math long division,btohqsg
brother what did u get for comb sci,btohqsg
I dun even know if anything is getting into my head,btohqsg
my vj friend laufh at me,btohqsg
There are lots of other things to worry about for h2 math than that lol,btohqsg
my friend got A1 for trip pure science,btohqsg
"""Ngl if ur concern of taking BCMG is because of Bio or Geog  you will soon relaise that the true threat of BCMG is Math and chem""",btohqsg
BRO HE WAS THE ONE THAT STOLE MY A1S,btohqsg
he has every right to make fun of me,btohqsg
any 4H2 combi that isn't BCME is cancerous,btohqsg
I thought bio more cancerous than math,btohqsg
But can’t rly speak since I never took bio,btohqsg
Also at least geog can smoke more compared to bio,btohqsg
Man how do ppl who sleep in class study,btohqsg
cannot be studied at home grind then go sch/institution  sleep,btohqsg
and i got another friend taking 4h2 bcme,btohqsg
TM don't offer b without c,btohqsg
all my jc friends take 4h2,btohqsg
No even if it's BCME it's also cancerous,btohqsg
she actually wished she took 4h2 pcme or pcmki or pcml,btohqsg
just take 3H2s and 2 H3s guys,btohqsg
Replace the E with G or H and it’s more cancerous,btohqsg
my 2 jx friends take 4h2,btohqsg
then my vj friens wants yo sign up for olympaid somemore,btohqsg
and my ri 4h2 friend wants to take h3 next year,btohqsg
wah seh i damn stupid sia,btohqsg
Also right I wonder if there’s any schs that allow students to take F math without math,btohqsg
I’m quite sure that even nyjc wouldn’t allow,btohqsg
- a wise man once said,btohqsg
But ny should still have the least restrictions among all jcs,btohqsg
thats why not many ppl take fmaths,btohqsg
wtf kinda graph is this bro,btohqsg
i am retarded i nvr take pure sci or amath so cannot take h2 double sci,btohqsg
unless you were in the time when a contrasting subject wasn't compulsory. then you can take PCFM,btohqsg
PBCM was so common last time,btohqsg
i would have taken that combi too,btohqsg
i honestly dk if i shld mug damn hard then in the coming future i sign up for olympiad with my vj friend,btohqsg
then 现场 he call me stupid,btohqsg
my friend rly wants me to go olympiad in the future sia,btohqsg
he say i can go for math n bio olympiad and win first place,btohqsg
wtf his expectations for me damn high sia,btohqsg
@ticktockisaclockwhat i meant by a math long division,btohqsg
in jc i didn’t study ah so it’s always last min look at notes but if you can’t focus when awake then it’s kinda pointless too,btohqsg
how to go math olympiad witj my vj friend,btohqsg
divide the denominator of the fraction using the numerator,btohqsg
for uni idk i try to learn but sometimes im a bit slow in processing what the lecturer says so i usually do it outside class,btohqsg
dayum i didn't know there was long division after pri sch lol,btohqsg
im doing this for bridging nc i nvr take a math,btohqsg
a random J2 came up to me and had a chat,btohqsg
the way u learn things so rabs,btohqsg
i havent seen atwy in so long ://,btohqsg
bro's just going up to every J1 he sees,btohqsg
i’m serious when i say jc i didn’t study LOL,btohqsg
every paper was the night before start one even during a levels,btohqsg
How u normally study one uh,btohqsg
hes the guy tht says he nvr study then gets full marks,btohqsg
For me I try not to study too early cause my info retention is shitty,btohqsg
guys i think siyan may be good at physics,btohqsg
did bro not take amaths 💀💀💀,btohqsg
physics mentioned??? wtf is being mentally sane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,btohqsg
I mean surely there's smth common like in your studying style all along,btohqsg
"""the only reason why I'm a treasurer for my class is because I'm the only person who took poa""- friend",btohqsg
no wonder my seniors told me to drop chem,btohqsg
why is ur U not for Ueconomics,btohqsg
i didn’t take econs so cannot use that,btohqsg
i feel like chem is either u get A or u fail,btohqsg
i havent eaten anything since 9am ama,btohqsg
@habibi5201@polarbearnextdoorhow am i gnna do for h10 meal skipping,btohqsg
I doing work at atrium so,btohqsg
yeah he just make small talk,btohqsg
hahahahhaa im so stupid dk how to do long division,btohqsg
i always try to understand everything so i can grind minimally lmao,btohqsg
how to go for olympiad aia,btohqsg
my vj friend later legit call me stupid,btohqsg
you either cook or be cooked,btohqsg

It's so nonsense the girls Infront of me turn ard,btohqsg
HE WANTS ME TO GO LOL,btohqsg
AYEE I TRYING OUT THAT METHOD too,btohqsg
Are you my GP paper? Because I really wanted to go for U (alvls rizz),btohqsg
cried in class bc i coukdnt do my hw,btohqsg
since idk how to do long division,btohqsg
This gonna be some self fulfilling properchy icl,btohqsg
imahine i take h2 double science,btohqsg
this chat is my 13th reason,btohqsg
go for it. if you start earlier it’ll work out way better than for me LOL,btohqsg
understanding is gonna help your info retention better than blind memory,btohqsg
No I try to review it consistently kinda,btohqsg
See see then orh ok can,btohqsg
My alvl subjs areH10 meal skippingH3 mirror selfie,btohqsg
you think more ahead than me,btohqsg
i havent rso since 2nd jan,btohqsg
Bio now is kinda dry but at least got more chemistry,btohqsg
later someone say I asking stupid qn,btohqsg
i mean even my current work there’s the qualitative concepts to understand but i also gotta sit down and grind out the math to make sure it’s right,btohqsg
H3 kai cenat  H10 grimace shake  H20 mewing  H1000 mcdonalds,btohqsg
i guess that applies for a levels,btohqsg
"""The Skibidi Toilet show is more interesting than Kai Cenat's debut to growing tall."" How far do you agree with the statement? (30m)",btohqsg
Shuddup  ill write an email to ur CO  later sign 7 extra,btohqsg

I make sure ur oc fuck u inside upside down also,btohqsg
Then i will fuck u understand?,btohqsg
Haiya i losing braincells talking to 0 rp people,btohqsg
how to do lomg division sia walao,btohqsg
my friend explain the shit idk what she saying,btohqsg
This I never do long division eh,btohqsg
guys pls dont be like me,btohqsg
I email my MP (member of parliament) and CHIEF OF ARMY AND DEFENCE MINISTER,btohqsg
It's a proper and rational fraction so there's no need to do long division..,btohqsg
if u nvr take a math dont go n do h2 math,btohqsg
I ask my father  civilian rank higher,btohqsg
See my careless mistakes you'd go wtf,btohqsg
but my tcher say if different deg dont do juggling method,btohqsg
idk how to do long division,btohqsg
I don’t like the juggling method bruh,btohqsg
yest i didnt even do 1 qn of hw,btohqsg
bc idk how to do long division,btohqsg
i sit at home stare at my. paper for 4 hours,btohqsg
Btw you'll see this shit again,btohqsg
then the teacher sounds like she calling ne stupid,btohqsg
I suggest u try question 1,btohqsg
no we need to do qn 6,btohqsg
i dw ask my mom help,btohqsg
later she fucking call me stuoid and slow learner,btohqsg
i want to learn the steps,btohqsg
But if udk where to start,btohqsg
Seeing how the ans come to be,btohqsg
U need help with sketching or something else?,btohqsg
Ya DW it abt it for now la,btohqsg
I thought the memorisation is cancerous for bio,btohqsg
So that’s why I didn’t take it for o levels,btohqsg
I don’t even know why that time I pick bio during sec 3,btohqsg
Should have just go with physics,btohqsg
I was very lucky my sec sch offered econs  I dun like the other humanities,btohqsg
What sch were you from if you don’t mind saying,btohqsg
Only 4 schs got o level Econs I think,btohqsg
I feel like take H2 bio then a lot of course in uni cannot take already,btohqsg
Yep  bell curve be my school competing with ourselves,btohqsg
I wanted to do some engineering course,btohqsg
aiya i go home ltr ask my mom since my mom excelled at matj during uni,btohqsg
I heard like in 2020 yall got 100% dist rate for Econs,btohqsg
We literally got consistently ab9e 90% distinction  like only 1 person didn’t,btohqsg
so what if she say i stupid and my brain cannot think deeper,btohqsg
Coz the other 3 schools are Temasek sec  Woodlands and I can’t rmb the last one,btohqsg
I think compete with intl students too but then again since the grades were awarded in Singapore moe could’ve just set their own grade boundaries separate from the UK o levels,btohqsg
Even though we use the same paper as them,btohqsg
Yea it has always been above 90% (my year only 1 person didn’t get distinction),btohqsg
But sadly we can’t tell since moe doesn’t release grade boundaries,btohqsg
At least since uk does I can see the grade boundaries for A* and A for the same paper,btohqsg
Then can have a rough idea,btohqsg
I actually forgot Cambridge exam we needa compete with international  but I mean Singapore always perform better internationally,btohqsg
Yeah  except that the o level Econs paper is the uk a levels version so it becomes a bit iffy,btohqsg
I don’t know whether moe just follows the uk grade boundaries or sets their own,btohqsg
But also uk o levels does not have grade numerical,btohqsg
I feel that doing econs in O level doesn’t necessary give an edge in Jc coz the qns style is also different  but content wise ya  can understand better,btohqsg
It’s just A* A B C,btohqsg
Oh wow I did not know that lmao,btohqsg
I’m surprised your Cher didn’t mention,btohqsg
But that’s the reason why the QP is quarantined,btohqsg
Idk does each country have its own bell curve or international bell curve,btohqsg
Don’t think so for the international paper,btohqsg
But o level Econs in Singapore is unique,btohqsg
Since as far as I know it’s the only paper where we don’t have a local version,btohqsg
And actually econs student population of o level in Singapore is very small,btohqsg
My class has 18 people  but 2 people drop,btohqsg
Yea my cher didn’t say anything about that,btohqsg
Every half a year there are 2 versions of the papers for students in different time zones. The papers are a bit different but since there are some similarities the QPs have to be quarantined to prevent leaks,btohqsg
But maybe that is why econs can only be counted as R2,btohqsg
That is one bad thing about doing econs I think,btohqsg
Coz got me i suffered coz my combine was ss + lit and I bad at both and ended up w a C5,btohqsg
If you search past year o level Econs paper and click the November/December version  you would realise one of the 2 is the one Singapore uses,btohqsg
I didn’t want take geog coz geog + econs is a content bomb,btohqsg
Tbh they should allow econs to be counted as compulsory humanities sia  coz it is really not easy,btohqsg
Unlike Singapore o/a levels the international/uk version isn’t copyrighted,btohqsg
And actually if I had econs as humans 1 instead  I would not be in TM  I would be in ASR lol,btohqsg
I think it won’t be until moe comes up with a harder version of their own lol,btohqsg
But seriously o level Econs is a free A1,btohqsg
Is it not hard already  the content is so much,btohqsg
The mark scheme is too lenient,btohqsg
For o levels? I thought no,btohqsg
Oh yea I got A1 consistently in 2y lol,btohqsg
Even if there is a fair bit of content the markers are so lenient,btohqsg
My book is actually quite thick,btohqsg
Econs had less stuff to memorise than elect geog,btohqsg
Even though elect geog is a half subject,btohqsg
I remembered I struggled with the central bank thing  and then before Os  I memo in my head  then the o level paper come out sia,btohqsg
That’s why I’m so glad I dropped bio for Econs,btohqsg
Only a superficial understanding of a lot of stuff is required lol,btohqsg
3 triple sci is w a elect what,btohqsg
Uk is like wider breadth but lower deprh,btohqsg
How did bio switch to econs,btohqsg
I rather the content be more than questions be hard,btohqsg
I love econs cos I wouldn’t have gotten A1 in history or geogeographygraphy,btohqsg
Took a gamble and won lmao,btohqsg
Ironically for my a levels i got B for Econs but A for geog even though my Econs has always been very good,btohqsg
Sry I dunno how geography became double…my auto,btohqsg
I thought Econs and geog are kind of similar,btohqsg
A levels was the 1st time I got an A for econs (I didn’t do well in j1  E —>  D)  but a good econs cher + I had tuition also  saved my ass and I got consistently a B,btohqsg
So I was quite glad finally an A,btohqsg
But sometimes shit happens I guess  I’m like one of those few ppl I know who always get 80-100 percentile for internal exams but a levels somehow B for Econs,btohqsg
Welp better to peak at a levels,btohqsg
But my teacher gave me hack  like A levels mark point form,btohqsg
In my class ppl where shocked I got b for Econs,btohqsg
So if u rushing  just whack point form  better than leaving blank,btohqsg
Many of them did much worse than me for prelims but got A,btohqsg
Actually I feel for my friend who ended up with a C and H3 game theory merit,btohqsg
Game theory seems more math than Econs,btohqsg
My class had no expression  and my friends all expected my grades,btohqsg
H3 moe syllabus is closer to my type,btohqsg
Ryaneh yk who our h2 math tchrt is,btohqsg
i want to book consult with her,btohqsg
Weird enough that my class seem to be doing well for econs but sucks at everything else,btohqsg
Is it like the teacher or like they only study for econs lmao,btohqsg
For me I did better than I expected for GP but worse than I expected for Econs and history,btohqsg
I was just hoping for C and I got it lmao,btohqsg
Coz I dun want do the academic writing mod,btohqsg
I hv been consistently getting E,btohqsg
At least your content all A,btohqsg
For GP I was expecting B/C but got A,btohqsg
No clue how it happened given that I fked up AQ very badly,btohqsg
Tbh I was lucky la  I got exactly what I hoped for (but not what I predicted),btohqsg
But I was thinking that my essay carried,btohqsg
You were expecting B for GP?,btohqsg
No I was hoping for a C lol,btohqsg
I dun think I m capable of anything highehigherr than,btohqsg
I expected lower than what I got,btohqsg
I think his name is Mr phang,btohqsg
But expected D or even E,btohqsg
Wait is it u different venue?,btohqsg
That one I no comments actually,btohqsg
Coz I dun even know how to study for GP,btohqsg
I remembered the first time I actually tried studying for GP for a day before the GP paper,btohqsg
I didn’t even touch GP before that,btohqsg
Then before the compre paper I was panicking like shit I forgot all the qn types,btohqsg
So I anyhow bullshit during the exam,btohqsg
But GP is very unpredictable I guess,btohqsg
Like 2 of my friends o level English A1 but GP B,btohqsg
I got B4 for o level but GP A,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure YT got >85rp after the retake,btohqsg
Honestly u can ask the study group,btohqsg
I was actually vvvvv bad at the compre,btohqsg
