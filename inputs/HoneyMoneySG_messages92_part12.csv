Transferred $1 from posb to HSBC ega. Amount not appearing in HSBC statement  transferred $1 2nd time got rejected and the 2nd transaction amount get refunded. But the first $1 went missing. Anyone tio before?,btohqsg
bro think u dun understand the question. do u know that u can set aside ERS at 55 and u can choose to withdraw up till BRS before 65 if u pledge ur property? that is y i am asking the brs amt that u withdraw is based on the brs amt at 55 year old or at age of withdrawal,btohqsg
Cohort BRS amount (i.e.  at 55 years old)  regardless of at what age u opt for BRS,btohqsg
Ok  got it. Thanks alot 😀,btohqsg
Maribank extends 2.88% interest to 30 June 2024.,btohqsg
BRS is always based on age of 55  not time of withdrawal,btohqsg
no strategy and not topup regularly to any OA/SA/MA  still < 5 years old,btohqsg
I don’t think (I may be wrong)  that if you already topped up RA to ERS at 55  you can then withdraw the difference in ERS vs BRS in full later.The principle of hitting ERS means you’ll need to manually transfer from FRS to ERS at RA. That transferred amount will be reserved and paid out via CPF Life. You can still pledge property to withdraw difference between FRS & BRS but the difference between ERS & FRS is reserved.,btohqsg

Hi guys  I need help with choosing which Citi Card to getfirst- PremierMiles or Rewards for the new customer sign up bonus.PremierMiles-30 960 milesRewards-19 200 milesLooking at purely this info  PM is the winner.But  my dilemma is this: Would the 30 960 miles still be worth it a year from now let's say  considering PM is 1.2mpd while Rewards is 4mpd local spend?Thanks guys! 😌,btohqsg
Get the Rewards card promotion as you would not need to pay the annual fee of $196.20. Factoring this cost in  the cost per mile for the PremierMiles promo is actually 1.66cents for the extra miles (up to u).Personally  I would find that abit expensive and get the Rewards card and it is an essential card to have anw,btohqsg
Hey everyoneHow do i get back overpaid amount in citi credit card?I have refunds from trip cancellation and its going into this card. Is it possible to withdraw them?,btohqsg
i did that before with Citibank need to call them  but .. they gave me cheque via mail,btohqsg
And he answered you. BRS and FRS is locked at 55. Even if you hit FRS  there's absolutely no way you can hit ERS through mandatory contributions with the existing CPF annual contributions limit.Read the related FAQs available:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/withdrawing-for-immediate-retirement-needs/withdrawal-of-cpf-savings-for-property-ownershttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/general-information-on-retirement/once-i-meet-my-full-retirement-sum--my-special-account-savings-w,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I opened SC bonus saver account last Nov. but I received my salary via paynow NRIC from cooperate. Is that possible to get salary interest?,btohqsg
Refunds will be counted on the statement month that you're currently on. If you don't spend in Feb  your refund in Feb for a Jan's transaction will be counted in Feb and brings the current spending to negative.,btohqsg

hi Melvyn..does the negative roll over to month of march? assuming end of feb.. still negative..,btohqsg
Hi  I have negative credit card balance in my OCBC account due to a refund. Can I withdraw that balance? Would it effect my credit score and be treated as cash advance? Would refund from another card lead to miles cashback? Thanks inadvance,btohqsg
Do you mean credit card  rather than account? (negative on bank account usually means you withdrew more money than you have  which is a bad sign),btohqsg
1. Refund would probably trigger a points clawback2. Negative on your card in this case means there’s money put into the card  not the other way around. So no concerns about being treated as cash advance or similar3. Personally I would just continue spending on that card as per normal to draw down on that surplus  might be more troublesome to try and transfer/withdraw it out,btohqsg
The refund was from another card via amaze.I booked a airbnb with Solitaire and subsequently it refunded back to amaze. I failed to took note that the refund went to OCBC. Would OCBC miles still be clawbacked if the source of the refund was from another card?,btohqsg
Can I check. Wat happens if the mcc code is not 1 of  the codes within the uob lady card categories? U simply don't get the 6pmd? Tis 5310.code doesn't fall in both Grocery or Family,btohqsg
If it doesnt fit the definition of the bonus categories  you don’t get the bonus. Simple as that,btohqsg
Get both at the same time. you will earn NTB for both which was what i did. For starters  always go with low lying fruit  easy to hit signing miles etc .. After which  plan according to specialised spending to continue the miles chasing journey ..,btohqsg
Submit as new application from website,btohqsg
that's interesting. how did you apply for both at the same time? Like was it you sat and applied for one then the other one immediately in one sitting?,btohqsg

Recently  I've been trying to build a miles CC stack but my application got rejected by Citibank and HSBC. I am wondering if there are any hacks/tips to go about that? Or any other miles card to recipe d or consider?I am self-employed  income is not an issue for me but I have only been working for ~ 11 months. My UOB credit cards only got approved because I have an account with them. Currently have UOB ladyAlso just kinda concerned if my credit score would be affected due to these rejections.,btohqsg
You already received sign up bonus for both?,btohqsg
I'm using UOB Lady which capped at 1k for 6mpd per month  the refund won't impact the miles I'm earning this month right? While the miles given last month will be clawed back due to refund  I will still get miles for the $500 spent this month right (even though the tracker no longer show $500 spent)?,btohqsg
