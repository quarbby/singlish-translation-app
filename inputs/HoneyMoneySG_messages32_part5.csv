How long uob cc application takes usually? They always say will arrange callback  but it's been a month and still pending. And of course no callback,btohqsg
Kris+ app free Famous Amos cookies.17-19 Feb,btohqsg
Nothing new on the call center. Best is every time I call  the person pick up will say he or she not trained in the area my query is on. My last try on cc application took me 3weeks,btohqsg
trust me they will NEVER callback. been there.,btohqsg
Now I called  cso said will connect directly with card specialist  after waiting 30 mins UOB just disconnected me lol,btohqsg
I applied through app. How did u apply?,btohqsg
Their promo is so stupid. 100 new to bank customers  how do u know? haha,btohqsg
Anyone know how long does it usually take to transfer miles from CC to Kris flyer,btohqsg
Uob u can forget welcome gift  ocbc most cc doesn't have. No wonder they don't have fees for atm withdrawal from each other üòÇ,btohqsg
can I ask when / where will this be reflected in my statement? I applied for the SC SMART card last Dec  no signs of the Cashback,btohqsg
Tried to apply again  says u applied recently and duplicate application,btohqsg
Same. What you should do is make big noise on their FB. After that all scrambling to reply.,btohqsg
Just opened one random post of uob on fb and read the comments. All about poor cs üòÇ,btohqsg
Hey guys  what is the admin fee if I want to withdraw cash in overseas using amaze than my regular cc. Or what other better option can I look at.,btohqsg
i seee  wont affect credit score? haha,btohqsg
I cancelled after 1-2 years  I applied again and still get. Especially if you have savings with the bank and never late payment  I don't see the reason.. üòÄ,btohqsg
Need to trial n error on overseas ATM machine  some ATM have additional fees. just cancel it unless emergency. If no fees  it will just dispense cash to you. The atm withdrawal above is done in Croatia  north Macedonia and Bulgaria. Hope it helps,btohqsg
how to tell whether theres fees or not during withdrawal? got prompt?,btohqsg
Yep it will prompt you whether you agree with the fees. Just press cancel when it pop out and try another bank ATM,btohqsg
Hello guys  does anyone have a rough estimate as to what is the value of 1 citimile,btohqsg
anyone knows if any card still earns rewards for town council bills?,btohqsg
trust bank card  it have zero withdrawal fee but still subjected to the local atm fee.hence basically 1 less fee compare to others,btohqsg
Hello! Does UOB EVOL give cashback for Whizcomms internet bill?I think it falls under Utilities - but not 100% sure. If it is really Utilities of course  no cashback.,btohqsg
I got it within 1 month of card approval. It should be reflected in your CC statement. It's only applicable to new SC credit card holders meaning you should not hold any SC credit cards in the last 12 months before your application date,btohqsg
Too underrated. Support this card more.,btohqsg
yes super underrated at it been 1 stop oversea card.- spot rate competitive to youtrip- balance is withdrawable- balance earn interest- able to switch to credit card or debit card- no oversea atm withdrawal feepeople using youtrip should switch over to trust for oversea spending,btohqsg
Definitely. I would rather spot rate than having to deal with top-up wallet... Especially fraudulent activity  good luck,btohqsg
All those who say they can lock their rates. How many actually do get better rates than spot üòÇ. Might as well play Forex,btohqsg
Hi guys  I apply KrisFlyer account together with KrisFlyer credit card  then email approved on krisflyer account. But no mention about credit card  is it mean my credit card no approved? No stated fail on credit card. Today only receive the debit card for krisflyer,btohqsg

Hi guysDoes anyone know if there's such short term (~5years) monthly investment/insurance plan?Been searching online & most of them are a minimum of 10 years where there's clause for early withdrawal,btohqsg
Maybe you can look at Fixed Deposits instead? Short term endowment plans are usually single and of higher premiums.,btohqsg
yea this is the first card I applied  checked the credit card statements no signs of the new sign up Cashback üòµ‚Äçüí´ tried calling SC hotline but there's no  option for this sort of query,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGIs there any Krisflyer promo code?,btohqsg
I didn't know Krisflyer account got expiry date  everything is gone....,btohqsg
No for now. Only have Kirs+ app,btohqsg
Kris+ app needs Krisflyer account right?,btohqsg
you can try contacting Krisflyer and see what they say.Krisflyer itself runs occasional referral promotions but the amount is nothing to shout about so you didn't miss anything,btohqsg
but moving on  remember each mile has a 3 year expiry upon earning,btohqsg
