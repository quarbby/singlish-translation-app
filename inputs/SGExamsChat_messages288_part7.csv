and i feel that such questions must be there,btohqsg
"is to weed out those that just ""memorise"" content",btohqsg
Feel like PSLE is at a way different stage of maturity thou,btohqsg
Actually  quite true ehMy lecturer told my classmates and me that Singapore is probably the only country that has such thing as Combined ScienceIn many countries  it's a must to take triple pure Science (I think),btohqsg
Their pure science is not as hard,btohqsg
Nah I donâ€™t think combined science should exist,btohqsg
like thats nt sarcastic btw LOL,btohqsg
It reallt doesnâ€™t enable you to appreciate how interesting science is,btohqsg
The only ones comparable to us are probably Japan  China  South Korea  etc imo,btohqsg
HAHAHAMy English is actually super badðŸ˜…,btohqsg
people might write classmate and I,btohqsg
Also I think its really just the naming and format,btohqsg
I mean you canâ€™t really compare us to other countries,btohqsg
Because other countries are huge so thereâ€™s tons of variation,btohqsg
Like from my experience I never really understood the breadth of chemistry,btohqsg
Until I began studying it for myself after Os,btohqsg
it depends on the mode of delivery oso,btohqsg
I mean yea China and India exams are difficult mostly becus of the number of students,btohqsg
LOL whats diff is u made the effort to search beyond,btohqsg
I mean the difference between pure and combined,btohqsg
I feel like cca shd not be made compulsory in src sch,btohqsg
since I heard of people that don't take,btohqsg
Just that they automatically default the 2 pts,btohqsg
Yea its a waste of time,btohqsg
Yea so shd be made optional,btohqsg
just that it comes at a cost,btohqsg
But the thing is ccas wont have enough people if optional,btohqsg
I mean u can drop without like consequences per se,btohqsg
And that cost can control ur future educstion choices,btohqsg
But is good because is passion,btohqsg
Really? It's not compulsory for my secondary school (although it's highly recommended for the students to join),btohqsg
I mean do u see alot of people joining ccas like band if optional lol,btohqsg
U dont lose the 2 pts?,btohqsg
I joined a CCA in secondary school and I got 2 points,btohqsg
U cant enter some schs without the  pts,btohqsg
Yea so u need a cca for the 2 pts no?,btohqsg
But u need 3 years for that shit,btohqsg
Minimum for 2 points is level 3 all no?,btohqsg
Actually  not reallyI joined Chinese Orchestra as I love musicBut thx to my 2 points  I got into polyðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Level 3 u already need 3 years,btohqsg
Also! all schools can get in,btohqsg
I mean the people who dont like cca are forced to join becus they are pretty much forced to if not their scores are lower,btohqsg
They can join cca thats most interest them ma,btohqsg
The problem is that u cant switch ccas,btohqsg
I wanted to play Liu Qin  but my instructor said my fingers were too weak to play Liu Qing  and there's lack of people playing Yang Qin  so he transferred me to play Yang Qin instead,btohqsg
If not u lose ur pts,btohqsg
or take two cca and drop,btohqsg
Q hard. In my experience the cca showcases in sec 1 are utter bullshit. They try to paint the cca as some holy piece of time well spent but it merely is an abyssal waste of time,btohqsg
If two people raw score are10 and 11 . But and person that got 11 points have two cca points while the other have none .Will poly or jc take the raw score of 10 or the one with,btohqsg
But that person have cca point,btohqsg
