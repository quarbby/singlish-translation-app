why is that? qv so bad?,btohqsg
e63 really nshw cruiser more comfortable in long run for my friend jing xun!,btohqsg
we actually went showroom together and the space in the back was really game changing  along with the reliability aspect,btohqsg
both are high quality tho i must agree,btohqsg
and that is why i said.  the alfa today is different from what you hear of the old alfa that has problems. i almost gave uo till i read up the new models with long term tests of users i decided to give it a shot and it's true i dont have many problems. just routine servicing and belts change,btohqsg
i thought they are same size?,btohqsg
look at the front door though  alfa abit hard to get in and out of,btohqsg
maybe the rear room is smaller,btohqsg
the rear of his e63 is unrivalled he drive me before,btohqsg
this is the desirable one but all sold out. limited edition GTAm,btohqsg
Share with us pics of your lovely Alfas before leh!,btohqsg
Some alfa aged really well in terms of design,btohqsg
how to rapidly select photos to delete? i am running out of space on my phone,btohqsg

They failed to learn their lesson from Nokia! That’s why! Defiant doesn’t mean you are right. Tesla has become such a profitable car manufacturer while most European make are trying to catch up,btohqsg
i cant stand their designs and styles. replace it with refreshing style,btohqsg

small car better be fropnt whee drive. less complex,btohqsg
Don’t think u are actually sorry,btohqsg
Actually I think it look sexy,btohqsg
think the recent bmw's actually not too bad,btohqsg
Like the repeated design which you say bmw has u keep repeating the same statements,btohqsg
i said sorry to mean sorry to disagree with many bmw lovers,btohqsg
each manufacturer has its fair share of ugly cars la not js bmw,btohqsg
To us  we respect that not everyone is the same. The diversity is what makes life less mundane,btohqsg
Not twin turbo. Only single turbo installed,btohqsg
My bad  twin scroll turbo not twin turbo,btohqsg
Twin turbo is 2x turbocharger of same size  twin scroll is 1 turbo with 2 scrolls  biturbo common on high end mercs have 2 turbos of different sizes,btohqsg
It's a keeper. I regret selling my giulietta after 3 years for the civic 1.5T. still can't get over it,btohqsg
buy a Giulia. buy a good used one. no regrets. 100%,btohqsg
There is no official definition adopted by manufacturers for this. Lol,btohqsg
I like the dashboard!!! So Sexy…,btohqsg
alfa styling. always so refreshing and original,btohqsg
no two models are the same in interior,btohqsg
If so why the OMv of Honda is higher?,btohqsg
Every model …. Acccord vs your 6,btohqsg
i dont track. by how much?,btohqsg
because of their pricing outside and where they are produced,btohqsg
Honda tends to have higher prices due to the reputation,btohqsg
maybe due to costs. selling price in japan is lower for mazda? i am guessing. but the interior quality is pretty good,btohqsg
this could be the reason. popularity,btohqsg
Mazda is lower SEs compared to 本田,btohqsg
oh definitely. small company family roots,btohqsg
Even then I can agree Mazda is good:),btohqsg
You put one VTEC immediately x1.5 the price,btohqsg
no doubt honda vtec is very good engine. but in terms of overall i prefer mazda,btohqsg
see all the old hondas increasing in value too frm S2k to NSX to even old accord,btohqsg
NSX is different. that is a sports car collection.,btohqsg
That's because of car enthusiasts pushing up price,btohqsg
If you want compare look at RX7 Effini price,btohqsg
