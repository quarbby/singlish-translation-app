Power become not relevant as all are too powerful and our speed limit is 70-90 that even my pmd can hit,btohqsg
i think won't lah. it's good for marketing but most won't pay for that coz not needed i am guessing,btohqsg
No no to me is the draw of power   like the coe grand t that is 350 horse or 400,btohqsg
Last time before ev u think it a poweful car,btohqsg
Now with ev they are just like cat a car,btohqsg
The way u look at power from cars is different,btohqsg
Like a Kia stinger   last time I will wah so powerful so fast   now is like why the car so loud but so slow,btohqsg
recently someone told me about some VERY fast Volvos,btohqsg
maybe our inhouse VS Angel can share,btohqsg
fast is really subjective  and depent on the driver mentality,btohqsg
but to me honda fit ftw!,btohqsg
fast or slow is too subjective,btohqsg
for me at least  sound fast can liao. scared with all the sgrv and tp cams around. later I lose my work permit.,btohqsg
fast acceleration within speed limit in other country is call exhibition of speed,btohqsg
nothing to exhibit when our speed limit is so low. I think you sneeze at your accelerator you already exceed speed limit liao,btohqsg
the cam capture nothing as 1 sec the car over take him already,btohqsg

Seems like the new implementation on the coe quota causes the quicker increase on the coe prices . Super shag .,btohqsg
can give GR a run for their money imo  just not as popular only,btohqsg
I have a better answer to the rise in price. I believe that due to Covid  most of the cars mileage is below 100k and in good condition. Hence most people will choose to renew for 5 or 10 years. As there is no deregistration  no growth means no extra quota,btohqsg
no new coe will mean less supply in turn lead to higher coe prices,btohqsg
i believe 100k for cat A is attainable and maintain for at least another year for high coe,btohqsg
jiayou homie work harder buy nice car😋😋,btohqsg

sorry but crossover design is the dumbest idea ever. either be a SUV or be a sedan/hatch/coupe. if you choose this means you cannot  make up your mind,btohqsg
my personal opinion though anyone is free to disagree,btohqsg
Generally now anything suv sell better then sedan and sports car   but to make up for the looks and handling they come out with cross over !!!,btohqsg
