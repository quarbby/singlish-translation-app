Not that i want to because im already dying with 17au,btohqsg
Oh I am almost guaranteed an overload to 24AUs for soon I can add a second major in Philosophy at the back of my degree,btohqsg
I maintened >4.2 tho so I get another 4 AU on top of that at least for the next STARs,btohqsg
It seems copable if you have the self discipline of a god,btohqsg
Na I am doing 28 soon.,btohqsg
i think my fren  told me he from RP 3.83 also cannot go ntu and nus,btohqsg
It would be 2.5 but FYP is forced if I wanna overload,btohqsg
Your ass would graduate faster than me,btohqsg
Yes it would be hilarious and I wanted that cuz it's funny af,btohqsg
Its ok im a survivor in ntu,btohqsg
Did u see the Aespa tickets selling rn,btohqsg
To buying cat 1 standing tickets from resellers,btohqsg
But it was an ok price,btohqsg
Probably not scalper per se bah,btohqsg
Person wanted to sell his tickets to upgrade to a better one,btohqsg
But +50 from og price is not terrible in my books,btohqsg
Just the price to pay to see aespa,btohqsg
I planning to try for the Macau one,btohqsg
Hell no ain't buying from resellers,btohqsg
If only they went to malaysia,btohqsg
Then at least can try that also,btohqsg
I only have 13 dollars to my name now sir,btohqsg
Also I haven't heard from RV for a long time.. since their last tour.,btohqsg
I heard they are having a comeback soon,btohqsg
I wanna listen to chill kill irl,btohqsg
Were there any talks about them renewing their contract,btohqsg
Yeah it's radio silence on that but I guarantee Irene is gonna renew,btohqsg
Dk about the rest I feel Wendy might also but Joy and Yeri... idk,btohqsg
If they renew  there could still be hope for another world tour but,btohqsg
Taeyeon is also radio silence too especially for tours.,btohqsg
Actually wtf is wrong with SM these days,btohqsg
SM is just putting all their money on aespa,btohqsg
And they aint even doing a good job at it either,btohqsg
^ exactly lmao ðŸ¤£  also their cash cow was never aespa,btohqsg
Gidle avoided SG this time tho with their 2024 tour.,btohqsg
LMAO i frankly dont like a lot of their new songs,btohqsg
Im glad i went for their 2023 concert but thats it,btohqsg
I'm just there for their classics,btohqsg
Tomboy was probably the last one that was a baller,btohqsg
Oh ok then I suppose itâ€™s not as bad,btohqsg
Yeah coupled with the fact that they took a long break because of the incident made tomboy better,btohqsg
Was the first concert I went to after the Covid melange,btohqsg
Few years back another dude tried to set it on fire and he fled to Korea after that  Japan demanded Korea to extradite this man which was then denied by Korean govt,btohqsg
Its the first concert any of us kpop fans went to after covid,btohqsg
Lucky i managed to score section B for that concert,btohqsg
Before all the bots and bypass shit ever existed,btohqsg
I miss those times I score one just logging in causally lmao,btohqsg
This Nazi leader grave was robbed,btohqsg
This japanese war general that led a team that was only formed 1 day after pearl harbour was attackedtook both Singapore and Malaya within 100 days from forming capturing Malaya on 31 January 1942 (55 days)and Singapore on 15 Feb 1942 (70 days)The irony is this guy graduated from a military academy in Hiroshima,btohqsg
