For the 2020 admissions exercise  the onlineappealportalwill openfrom 2 May - 16 July 2020. Only applicants whose outcome of their applications is known (successful or reject)cansubmit theirappealsonline. In your onlineappeal  you may state your reasons for reconsideration (not more than 1000 words).,btohqsg
If you wish to appeal against the admission decision of NUS  you are required to submit an online appeal during the online appeal exercise from 22 to 27 May 2020. You may submit multiple appeals but only the last online appeal received by the closing date of the online appeal exercise will be considered.A maximum of 1000 characters is allowed for the reasons of your appeal. You are strongly advised to exercise personal planning when submitting the appeal as applying only to NUS is not a valid reason for appeals.¬† The length of the written appeal does not enhance your chances  hence it is important for you to provide a concise summary.,btohqsg

More like they can‚Äôt even fly over there maybe,btohqsg
