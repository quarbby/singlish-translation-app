Is it consider travel if top-up TNG and maxis 5G SIM in Malaysia with Citi reward MC and amaze?,btohqsg
Top up to tng is excluded mcc,btohqsg
Utilities and season parking most likely are excluded. Check the exclusion list of the card you are holding. Excluded spends for the card will also be excluded from the 500 min spend.,btohqsg

Next statement or even the one after that. Wait for the notification from DBS or when it says that the deduction will be made via GIRO in the statement.,btohqsg
Ok  noted. So I shd still transfer manually this month. Thanks!,btohqsg
Snack investment is ridiculous. just 10 days and I am losing close to 1%.,btohqsg

Haiyo! That sucks leh. Then how i know my transport fare how much? Transfer dun even know. So mafan need do recheck. Damn sucks leh. Like downgrade,btohqsg
Tell u to check via the nets app üòÇ,btohqsg
Tell u to track via SimplyGo app or nets app lol  better off fully transition to bank card system,btohqsg
hi all  is there any CC sign up promotion by ICBC ?,btohqsg
simplygo is a bit of a shitshow. Makes mistakes and charges wrong fare etc. Have to look through and ask for refund manually. Dunno whose KPI was hit with this but this + the new in vehicle ERP unit is just a disaster,btohqsg
I am planning to get this one but there doesnt seem to be any promo going onhttps://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/icbc-global-travel-mastercard-credit-card?provider_slugs%5B%5D=icbc&category_slug=best-credit-cards&sort_by=recommended,btohqsg
https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_400If I want to transfer out 100 sg stock from moomoo to cdp  the charges is $10*100 or just $10?,btohqsg
What is your timeline for when you intend to start taking that investment out? Time horizon and risk appetite will determine what you can/should invest in,btohqsg
Why don't just use debit or credit card? Use SimplyGo to track your transactions  they even notify you the moment you're done with your trip.Y'all people complaining are the ones going backwards when the current options are simpler lol.Never went back to EZlink/NETS FP since 2017.,btohqsg
100 units of one stock (like DBS) or 100 different stocks? also  did you try asking their chat?,btohqsg
100 unit of DBS. Ok will ask their chat. I thought ask here will be faster,btohqsg
5-6 years from now  I do not mind taking a higher risk,btohqsg
Chat was faster than here üòÅ,btohqsg
Ah okay thanks I guess for smaller dca I can use moomoo then maybe do bulk transfer to cdp  will be cheaper than DBS bickers cash upfront,btohqsg
Any guru can advise on this üôè,btohqsg
Hi Chris  For the 3 gb roaming  if don‚Äôt use 1gb for Indonesia and Thailand  can it be interchange to Malaysia to become 3gb total?,btohqsg
As someone that use SimplyGo since TL-ABT days  I agree too. Plus it has come a long way  last time missing extrance / exit is pretty commonplace  now rarely have the issue alr imo.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know what is the next best card to use for travel booking with UOB besides the Lady's card once the promo ends on 29 Feb?,btohqsg
According to Heymax  MCC is 7996. i used Amaze+CRMC for Harry Potter Studios Tokyo also 7996  and was awarded 4mpd.,btohqsg
No. 2GB Malaysia strictly  so do 1GB Indo + Thai.,btohqsg
My exact thoughts. They never experienced the days where some readers were not upgraded (even on the same bus) and you have be the awkward one who exits in the front. Sometimes I just leave if it's inconvenient and claim on the app afterwards.Now the only time the reader don't even read is because of some software glitch on Samsung Pay app on my watch. I would just tap my phone (using Samsung Pay so don't need to unlock) that I'm already using while boarding and be on my way.Never had to top-up to take public transport for the past 7 years. If you have multiple devices and tap on the wrong one  just claim on the app. Till now my claims are 100% success rate.,btohqsg
good that they have made it better. I had bad experiences with them in 2019 ish. It was a hassle having to look through your records on the app and claim. I also wonder about non tech savvy people who are being forced to upgrade.I do love the credit card integration. So good that I tell all the tourists about it :D,btohqsg
Ya... I've even faced cases where cos I couldn't tap out from the previous bus  the subsequent buses cannot use that virtual card anymore. Luckily I've other cards  just tap those and claim later on.Most of the time random issues happen on the MasterCard  not VISA. The daily posting seems to work better in my experience.,btohqsg
The only thing is that non local cards have to pay a surcharge on top of their FX fees. Tho one can argue that it's unlikely the extra charges can roll to $5 or more (NETS Prepaid / SimplyGo Ezlink card cost).,btohqsg
