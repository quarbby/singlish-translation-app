First Singapore GP was 2008... Ownself do the math,btohqsg
2008 was the first year. Source: I was flag marshal at turn 9,btohqsg
Liddat ppl chiong LCK 40 tiang or 99 turns also count?,btohqsg
It was an actual grand prix LOL,btohqsg
formula 2 and motorcycles raced there,btohqsg
Any parts of this old circuit still remaining / driveable?,btohqsg
but a few years ago got speed cam,btohqsg
Cool. Would love to drive through,btohqsg
just pulling ur leg la haha,btohqsg
Actually Singapore could really use a race track that can be used by the public for a fee. Like in prettyMuch every other developed country. land is too scarce and valuable here,btohqsg
Drive normally can. Drive like racing driver cannot. Confirm crash.,btohqsg
Just don't get caught by tp,btohqsg
actually a very very good layout if u ask me,btohqsg
the plaza sing bit  is so good,btohqsg
I think it would be a great revenue driver for Singapore and be a nice tourist activity as well. Can operate like Nurburgring and rent out cars so that tourists can run the track as well,btohqsg
it was supposed to be at changi,btohqsg
