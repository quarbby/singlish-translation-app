hi all gurus. i'll have to commit to a spending of approx $800-900 this weekend and merchant accepts only Grabpay  paynow/paylah or bank transfer I believe.credit card payment can be chosen but there is an additional 5% surcharge for credit cards so i don' think that is the best idea.am thinking of using either Amex Cashback Card or UOB Amex to top up to GrabPay but would the gurus here have a better way to optimize this spending?,btohqsg
Bank transfer can give option to cardup or citipayall. Be good if u can time it but it abit late.,btohqsg
haven't explored the cardup option nor learnt about it before but i think its a good time to start now. haha. thanks for pointing that out boss,btohqsg
"Confirm got gostan. I found the old ""after 2nd may"" t&c.",btohqsg
Is using citi premiermiles via cardup for income tax payment good? Or do you guys only use uob prvi for it,btohqsg
Citi Premier miles give 1.2 mpd. UOB PRIV gives 1.4 mpd,btohqsg
