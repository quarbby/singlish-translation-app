Llm 65-70% oddle jobs. If he don't take. Then nthg much left to takeüòÇ,btohqsg
For those new or old but still no idea.. let me share some good tips cause some may overlooked.,btohqsg
After call customer and confirm job and what specific item to collect and customer mention small item but upon arrival is an oversized item. U may cancel and also ask for 50% compensation. Same thing for customer for double booked order.,btohqsg
how to claim  call llm? or ask from customer,btohqsg
Normally if credit job u have to report to lalamove. If cash jobs i normally will ask customer to pay the 50% cancellation fees. If customer disagreed  no choice have to go thru llm.,btohqsg

Sometimes the contact number not updatedIf u accept orders on lalamove normally no need to cancel. Just go.Is usually confirmed,btohqsg
LLM policy is call before you process  anything happen your call is helpful,btohqsg
Especially when claiming waiting fee  no call =  as LL suck thumb,btohqsg
Guys i cashout 19feb when i get? Not Thursday 22nd eh?,btohqsg
Ya. Kena a lot oddle orders I didn‚Äôt call to confirm so cannot claim waiting fee. So bullshit,btohqsg
You missed the Sunday cut off already  on 18 Feb,btohqsg
28th Feb. Best is cash out every Sunday.,btohqsg
Just have to follow protocol  even though their protocol is nonsensical.,btohqsg
I cash out everyday when I work ü§£ü§£ in case LLM wna play stunt and freeze my money,btohqsg
LLM can say goodbye already lah..,btohqsg
Pick up a job. Called customer on both sender & receiver number  both not answering. Go live chat with LLM and asked to cancel the job as customer not answering the calls. Job was cancelled and got suspend 30mins. Customer fault becoming partners fault. How to earn like this? Nonsense.,btohqsg
Even when they start to crash  you won‚Äôt receive your money until Wednesday morning of the following week. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
This one is really unfair in my opinion.,btohqsg
Do u call for every job that you do,btohqsg
Most of it.. sometimes cant call due to on the road on highway.,btohqsg
"Some jobs when u accept and cant call them  but leave a text in the app saying ""on my way"" and u really making your way there. Suddenly almost arrived at location they cancel u up.. damn shag.. dont know what to do. Hahhahah.. this Llm really useless... hahhaa",btohqsg
Im a llm customer too.. at times using the platform to booked a partners to send my items. But in this case i wont support llm anymore.. their system is totally not fair for partners only benefits customer and llm company. It should be Equity to all..,btohqsg
This just happen to me  customer answer but never said want to cancel order. I found out order cancel when I reached pu,btohqsg
Basically just waste of time for us,btohqsg
Ya. And I busy on the road and following GPS  can't see notification or check status. Reach pickup location then realise order cancelled wtf,btohqsg
There was once i reached pickup point  dial condo intercom (noone pick up)  then called the person (noone pick up).The person cancelled order. Fkin rude. Waste time. I sent SMS to her lol,btohqsg
