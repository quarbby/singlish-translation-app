This regulations are still quite new in the eyes of IRAS  thus is not yet implemented in the systems (rough guess based on my understanding). You will notice you will need to fill in fatca and crs self cert forms when u open accounts with the banks in more recent years.Anyways  if it is from an understanding perspective  is a regulation originated from US and then subsequently to other jurisdictions for the prevention of tax evasion. From a consumer perspective on how this will impact you as a client of a FI  no impact as long you still stays in SG only. Ie no impact ie also means ignore.,btohqsg

At the end of the month since CPF takes the last day closing for interest calculation.You might not want to only initiate the payment on the last day itself since I do not know the time cut off. Also take note of weekends. Do this on a working day or it might slip into next month.,btohqsg

Any difference between doing it in Jan vs Dec? Iâ€™ve been doing it in Jan but Iâ€™ve seen people doing it in Dec and not sure of the rationale,btohqsg
The tax deductible counts by calendar year. You can claim deductions for 2024 in 2025 only if the transaction happens this year. For transactions that happen in Jan 2025  you can only claim for those in 2026.These deductions are automatic so do not try to manually input it.,btohqsg
