Don't withdraw till end July. Just keep adding 2k every month and 5 txns to earn additional 1% on top of the promotion interest rate.,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong  the bonus 1% interest is only on the 2k (new funds added) per month = [2 000*(0.01/365)*30] = $1.64 ?,btohqsg

does hsbc revolution include recurring payments such as discord nitro  youtube premium and spotify premium as eligible for 10x rewards?,btohqsg
reference month will always be 1 month before you send the sms,btohqsg
if u send the SMS this month  reference month will be March,btohqsg
If I have a online transaction using uob Evo on 31 March but the post date is indicated on the app on 3 apr   do I get cashback for apr for this online transaction?,btohqsg
Unfortunately  unlike the DBS counterpart  you can't,btohqsg
"I think you meant ""don't withdraw until end of JUNE"" (not end of JULY lah). Timothy said he is eligible for March-April-May-June. By right he can withdraw on 1st July so that he can participate again for next promo (Aug) with July lowest ADB as reference month",btohqsg
Hey guysFor esaver account  once applied  how long does it take for scb to approve the application so that I can transfer the funds ?Also  understand that 3.8% is valid only till June.

Hey if I pay for food using Citi rewards + amaze  it‚Äôll clock under 4MPD as online spending right?,btohqsg
Hey jus curious  the 3.8% is not daily interest is it? Didn't seem to get any interest into my acc by midnight,btohqsg
I don't think scb will give you interest daily. Unlike GXS where it gives you interest daily. Scb will calculate the interest at the end of month,btohqsg
Ohh I see... So if I put money on 6th April  when does the interest come in? End of month or 1 month after I put the money in haha,btohqsg
I was at the branch. Thats why the account was created on the spot. And I transfer the money the next day via fast.,btohqsg
I believe its end of month. For Apr  it will be prorated.,btohqsg
If u want daily why no try gxs,btohqsg
I tried  but it put me on waiting list after I created acc haha  u know how to get accepted in?,btohqsg
I am also on waiting list,btohqsg
Use the same Mobile on grab to try gxs,btohqsg
Or just wait since u didn't have a invite on grab app,btohqsg
Yep we know hahaI mean that's why it's called a waiting list üòÖ,btohqsg
Maybe grab low spender on grab so they Deen u slower to get a head started,btohqsg
I was a big spender on grab but still dunno the reason how they pick snd send invite,btohqsg
Hi question regarding HSBC EGA!Thinking to put $x in to earn the bonus interest. Do I have to split the $x over 4 months and top up every month for 4 months to earn the bonus interest?Or just 1 time deposit of $x can alr?,btohqsg
This is assuming you have very little funds in your EGA account in Mar.,btohqsg
I have just opened it 5 min ago,btohqsg
So if I put in $xx now  I‚Äôll get the 4.35%? nothing else to do?,btohqsg
You need to send sms to sign up for the bonus interest promotion,btohqsg
There is another parallel promotion called Everyday+ that gives an additional 1% interest. If you want to earn maximum interest for HSBC EGA  you'll need to do some homework and look through the T&Cs,btohqsg
