😒 don't insult special sch kids leh.. u think they choose to be like that meh?,btohqsg
I never insult them but I think partly is parents fault,btohqsg
I've honestly seen special needs kids / adults.. who behave way better than self-entitled normal kids / adults...It's all in how they speak and behave... They have their quirks and they are aware.. they act out mostly because they're overloaded on their senses.,btohqsg
It's just because they don't express themselves as well or control themselves as well..,btohqsg
While on the flip side  we have perfectly functioning adults and children behaving in ways where they should deserve a good tight slap to wake up their ideas.. but aren't... Some because they have $$ or drive big / branded cars or stay in certain types of property or work certain types of industry or hold certain positions,btohqsg
I also duno why people like these have no shame to show their ugly face in society. 🙄,btohqsg
But I do hope parents can be more responsible la  want do baby can la,btohqsg

As Long they don’t touch me I’m fine,btohqsg
It's not a lot.It's just more people having kids later on in life...And less stigma on such so more are being integrated into society and workforce... Rather than just locked up at home by caregivers,btohqsg
U? Haven't seen your face yet .. doubt it's as bad as the one I really don't like... Don't worry.,btohqsg

But parents have to start to take note,btohqsg
U think they don't? They live with them 24/7 and have to worry about who is going to take care of said special needs kids after they're old and infirm or needing medical care themselves.. 😑😒🙄,btohqsg
