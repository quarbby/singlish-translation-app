cause it was wen they agreed to meet the 2Â°C limit,btohqsg
The golden rice shit is a classic,btohqsg
I think I'll pass the test tmr,btohqsg
i hope they test smth funny,btohqsg
"""we can never protect  we can only adapt""",btohqsg
I'll send U the qn when I'm done,btohqsg
"""It is easier to adapt to climate change than to mitigate it."" Do you agree?",btohqsg
im very good at scaring people,btohqsg
Tldr mainly feasible for DCs right,btohqsg
Do a CCS. What is the point of the question,btohqsg
Just do History ppl. It's better than Geo is all I can say,btohqsg
Do H2 don't do H1. Economic History is a great addition if u alr doing econs,btohqsg
I feel like most ppl taking h2 hist take econs,btohqsg
Because economic history u kinda need econs,btohqsg
If not it makes no sense especially at things like AFC and Import Substitution,btohqsg
idk i dont take econs and they removed afc from syllabus alr,btohqsg
my fav part of h2 history,btohqsg
u just blame thailand for everything,btohqsg
ur chocie is either u do RE or AF,btohqsg
we learn about it but its not,btohqsg
then AFC is always the easier qn,btohqsg
cuz RE u need to know too much,btohqsg
Depends lmao u gotta answer it correctly u dun just blame Thailand,btohqsg
like its basically NU and PolStab part 2,btohqsg
im not a history student btw,btohqsg
this is just what I gather from people teaching me h2 history,btohqsg
We write that as the intro,btohqsg
taking h2 hist as a sci stream student feels  weird,btohqsg
(same situation  im the only geog student in my friend grp so everytime they study history they end up just teaching me),btohqsg
Like Thailand is the first domino basically,btohqsg
But I can write bs and actually score for that,btohqsg
reasons why i cant be a history student,btohqsg
i blame the thai for everything bad in the world,btohqsg
U write the word blame u insta ded,btohqsg
I would care if it was literature,btohqsg
He made it worse for malaysia,btohqsg
To give a fuck or not to give a fuck that's the question.,btohqsg
i dont know much abt AFC apart from thailand started it,btohqsg
In Economic History AFC is easy because it's a classic example of capital flight and the hot money inflows and outflows,btohqsg
But the issue is that most don't recognise the underlying issue that it exposed and fail to mention the fixed exchange rates,btohqsg
Short term usually put in there for interest,btohqsg
The classic phrase for hot money is there are 3 ways to stay in this business be first be smarter or to cheat. Now I don't cheat and although I think we do have some really smart people in this room it is a hell alot better to just be first.,btohqsg
At least u aren't required to concentrate in there.,btohqsg
so the number of days u get is the exact one,btohqsg
and now we cant have more than 3 mc days a month,btohqsg
What happens if u get a specialist,btohqsg
if its more than 3 day need to be approved,btohqsg
all the way back to camp,btohqsg
they check for 70% of the people,btohqsg
but thats if u come at like after 7.30am,btohqsg
