However  when I press on PayNow to add in PayNow account. Only DBS PayLah  OCBC bank and SCB available,btohqsg
What needs to be done to add in my PayNow account using POSB?,btohqsg
So does PayLah! able to receive cash rewards earn from scratch cards in Google Pay?,btohqsg
in the first place does the merchant allow payment via paynow? or paylah only?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check what are you guys using to pay for annual insurance premiums at the moment?,btohqsg
Paylah and paynow are similar  right?No point having paylah,btohqsg
My objective is to receive the cash rewards from scratch card in google pay. I usually use google pay to transfer $$ to my friends and colleagues.,btohqsg
Paylah is a wallet that stores money. Paynow is a service that lets you transfer money from one wallet to another bank account.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how you can transfer the miles awarded for referrals in Kris+ to Krisflyer? I've managed to transfer those for purchases made  but somehow the miles awarded for referral cannot be transferred. Not sure if I'm somehow doing it wrongly. These miles I mentioned are still within 7 days.,btohqsg
Referral miles dont think is transferable,btohqsg
By disabling auto top up  PayLah limits your loss if you transferred wrong amount. Paynow transfers whatever wrong amount you entered n available amount in your account.,btohqsg
in that case u should get scratchcard if u transfer min $10 to friends on Gpay  doesn't matter funded by Paylah/ocbc/scb,btohqsg
"thanks that explains... does it mean the only way to utilise it is through the ""pay by miles"" option? Any other ways to utilize these miles? Sorry  new kris+ user here.",btohqsg
Yes  that is what I did but the google pay indicate that I need to link my PayNow account to get the cashback rewards,btohqsg
This is even though I had PayLah! already link in google pay,btohqsg
u need to link ur paynow account to receive the cashback,btohqsg
So how do I link my PayNow account when my PayNow is POSB? Google pay only have PayLah!  OCBC bank and SCB,btohqsg
Deactivate at posb bank account 1st,btohqsg
Lendlease promo still have as of now?,btohqsg
paylah/ocbc/scb is just for the source. When they send to you  your paynow will go wherever it's set up.For instance I right now have paynow set up to HSBC. When someone sent me $ on Google Pay it goes to my HSBC account.But for sending money I set it up as OCBC  when I send money through Google Pay it deducts from my OCBC account,btohqsg
How can i reach $4 per $1 dollar spend on Citi Premier Card.,btohqsg
Its a bit unclear in the T&Cs,btohqsg
generally it’s 1.2miles per $1 dollar for local spending.but during promotion may reach up to 4miles per $1 dollar (e.g.  Agoda linked bookings),btohqsg
2miles per $1 dollar if i recall correctly,btohqsg
yeh then on certain currencies its an additional $2,btohqsg
just trying to figure out reach ones,btohqsg
if u referring to the overseas promo  all foreign currencies ok. Need to register for the promo and fulfil $5000 spend in the month,btohqsg
whats the best miles card atm?,btohqsg
uob lady solitaire? but provided your spending fall under the 6mpd catrgories,btohqsg
You can try online chat with the agent under help center to find out the reason.,btohqsg
Can i use hsbc advance credit card to pay for travel related transactions which were excluded from hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
I found this with a simple Google search,btohqsg
Thanks for the insightful sharing Chris! Love it!,btohqsg
Is it still worth it getting the uob lady solitaire card? 6 miles/$ seems like will end by 29 Feb. And the $5 block earn rate also not so enticing,btohqsg
$3k quota for 4 mpd (if it reverts back) is still quite good,btohqsg
And the $5 block doesn't affect uob lady solitaire much since the bonus is going to be based on accumulated spending. Will still get 5.6 mpd / 3.6 mpd. With such high quota it's still a good option,btohqsg
No rush since it end of season. If it reverts to 4mpd is good already. Now subscribers have exploded. Hopefully no nerfed fingers crossed.,btohqsg
Anyone use Lady card w Amaze for oversea shopping?,btohqsg
A lot of people asked this question in the past. You may find the answers in chat history. Perhaps search using “Lady oversea amaze”,btohqsg
Am wondering is there alternate card for tour agency payment for miles?,btohqsg
Hi  is there anyway to check the miles earned for each transaction by UOB krisflyer cc? The statment only shows the total miles earned for the entire month.,btohqsg
If not wrong have to use excel to keep track,btohqsg
Hopefully will extend or i am back to DBS WWMC,btohqsg

To add on.. due to 2)  if I want monthly $1400 trades  I need $1400 maintained at Poems which earns no interest. At 4 percent a year  that’s $56 or $4.67 a month!!Hmm… so whatever savings from not paying the $5 min BCIP to Ocbc disappear  plus poems charge 1% net dividend (min $1) whenever I get dividend.Overall  still worth to change?,btohqsg
For spend on board of Royal Caribbean cruise  anyone know the MCC? I check heymax = 4411  which mean CRMC + Amaze  will not work?,btohqsg
Anyone considering between SCB Bonusaver and Citi Plus? The new promo for Citi Plus seems to be better than SCB Bonusaver  but my concern is need to maintain at least $15K and above in order to avoid the fall below fee. Which is better? Thks.,btohqsg
Should be under travel mcc so citi crmc wont get 4 mpd  consider using uob lady with travel cat,btohqsg
