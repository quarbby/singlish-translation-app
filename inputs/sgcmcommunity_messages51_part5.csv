Got air pump on every fuel pump slot,btohqsg
when pump tyres i heard some ppl like use premium air,btohqsg
they top up their indicator fluid at the same time,btohqsg
because the pressure control more accurate,btohqsg
I do this monthly  gotta be a responsible car owner to ensure my car in good proper order.,btohqsg
With the low RPM  you are likely to use nearly the full power. 107bhp on a torquey engine is enough,btohqsg
hp dont really matter much haha  more about torque and when the torque comes in,btohqsg
the car is meant for city driving as ling as torque comes in before 2k should be adequate to drive smoothly around town,btohqsg
if u go msia cfm kena smoked by myvi one,btohqsg
Can hear the fear of others as it approaches,btohqsg
I would too. Lambo impress women  gtr impress men lol,btohqsg
Agreed. Even the interior has been so modernized  it doesnt look racy anymore. Ecept the seats. The ctr supposed to be a boy race dream,btohqsg
It is a marvel  but i dont think reviewer managed to get the time under 5s,btohqsg
"real world is 5s tested in ""msia""",btohqsg
And im skeptical about the power delivery on the street. E.g. when u in eco mode and have the sudden need for harder acceleration  how smooth is the transition and power delivery?,btohqsg
only when u change from electric and turn on the engine,btohqsg
change from electric to engine  abit of j3rk,btohqsg
but thats negligeble when you are already rolling,btohqsg
its quite impressive to me la HAHA,btohqsg
Oh is that so. Then its not fair for the other cars  they could have been faster too. But then again  they wont be able to build the revs before launch.To 9k and to the moon! Hahaha,btohqsg
i mean  most cars are first feet of rollout,btohqsg
but yeah u will never get below 5s stock,btohqsg
but w tune... cant say the sameðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,btohqsg
Ya thats the transition that i feel cannot be perfect. Impressive but not perfect.,btohqsg
I never got to test drive. Apparantly they dont allow test for the t8s if u dont put deposit.,btohqsg
maybe i nvr sit enough cars to have a good bench mark,btohqsg
Haha must be level playing ground ma. With tune the m340i would have obilerated the t8 even more. Sorry bmw fan boy,btohqsg
I never driven hybrid  thats im skeptical lol,btohqsg
I sat in prius  but nobody launches them for me to feel the real transition,btohqsg
cos they have a system to auto burn fuel if the fuel stays in for too long,btohqsg
so my friend tried real world everyday charge and dont use petrol,btohqsg
Serious? Lol. Thats like a weird system,btohqsg
must ma  if not the petrol will spoil in the tank,btohqsg
plus the engine needs to run once in a while to be healthy,btohqsg
Yea i was thinking somewhere along the lines of that. Flushing the fuel lines and clearing the carbon and gases,btohqsg
I was watching ys khong doing the hull climb on the s60 t8. It did pretty well despite the weight. But didn't get to see the power transition,btohqsg
from one of the ex T8 owners that swapped to PS2,btohqsg
I know who he is. He is a beast when it comes to calculations lol,btohqsg
his second home is wearnes showroom... always updating the volvo guysðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶,btohqsg
Hahaha he could be. I kinda hate telegrams anynomity sometimes,btohqsg
He can be the official test driver man,btohqsg
haha  no la he is not here,btohqsg
he recently drove 1600km in malaysia with his polestar 2 a few weeks ago,btohqsg
I just saw an auntie driving a porsche,btohqsg
The way she drive like first driving,btohqsg
Freaking slow she go up and turn ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can see the face also lowkey scared,btohqsg
Sian to be stuck behind these drivers.,btohqsg
But no choice. If horn  they lagi nervous. Only makes things worse,btohqsg
in front then should be more scared,btohqsg
