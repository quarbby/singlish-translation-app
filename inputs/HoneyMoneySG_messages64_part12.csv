after saw the chris new best dca video  if want to switch to ibkr.should we keep our stocks in existing broker ? or sell itwhat is the best way ?,btohqsg
I have the same problem.If you monitor your portfolio as a whole  then switching is better  since your selling action (and gain/loss) is captured.If you monitor based on each stock/ETF  then you will see the gain/loss your new stock/ETF in IBKR starting from the date you transfer. Then the long term performance may be different. In addition  switching to different broker will incur additional fee.For my case  I'll maintain existing one  stop the existing RSP  and switch new RSP via IBKR. The downside is you got so many stocks/platform to monitor.My 5 cent. Wait for other's advice and insight.,btohqsg
thanks for the opinion  ya same concern to me,btohqsg

There are two Tbill every month. Maybe you want to use both to calculate how many months loss for each Tbill respectively. Perhaps one of it is 7 months and the other is 8 months?,btohqsg
