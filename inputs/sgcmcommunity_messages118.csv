Recommended Paint Protection Specialists in Singapore (2023 Edition) 👍Are you a car owner who likes a constantly glossy  shiny appearance?  ✨A visit to one of these paint protection specialists is all you need!➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
8 horrible roads and junctions in Singapore that always get your blood boiling 😡Over the years  LTA has reconfigured and simplified some roads in Singapore to help smoothen out traffic. 🚗However  there are still some other frustrating roads and/or junctions that always gets drivers bothered. Here's a list of some of them that you should take note of  especially if you're a newer driver.👉🏻 Comment and share other roads you have in mind after reading this article!➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
Can do a horrible drivers article? 🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
The pie to cte and pie at entrance to pie at sims Dr  always jam at peak hours cos most drivers try to merge at the beginning  when there is a few km of road stretch ahead  sufficient to merge or cross to cte towards amk/city...aiyoh,btohqsg
One good practice I think would be for drivers on highways to avoid last lane where there's entrance  so that there is no jam that leads from eway entrance to the main roads especially the moumein road,btohqsg
One good practise would be just change lane early and prepare to exit if one needs to. Not rush all the way to cut queue then cut in at last minute.,btohqsg
"I agrees.Many times  there are people cutting in the last minute. Causing alot of total stopping.. hence  the long traffic jam.They like to play ""🐔 chicken""Hit me if you dare 😜",btohqsg
That is so lame. Who doesn’t know how to cut to front and cut in at last minute? We just don’t because we have etiquette. It almost always causes the outer lane to get blocked because they can’t go in so block the entire lane.,btohqsg
i see some people on PIE to enter CTE/SLE,btohqsg
cannot cut in they just stop there and try to  force way in,btohqsg
i highbeam a few alr. just refuse to queue up  and they alr know need queue de,btohqsg
the jam is getting worse these days . think Coe too cheap . ERP too cheap,btohqsg
driving to town during peak hour easily 45 min to 1 HR  for me🥲,btohqsg
but if jam is 40 mins,btohqsg
stay near town so what  still need take mrt to office,btohqsg
yah my trip to town quite exp now leh,btohqsg
last time its about 2 dollars ish,btohqsg
Some very kiasu  looking for a pocket of opportunity to cut it. But that's other people's safe braking distance box🤦Some Blur  never see overhead signature  last minutes cut int 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
nowadays i dun care liao. just horn until they go straight. dont make ur problem into other ppl problem sia,btohqsg

So many empty lot no need to go the nearest 1 near the entrance,btohqsg
Or you could just move the chair and get on with your day,btohqsg
Dun want to get famous overnight also,btohqsg

Wanna talk about getting into those old building car parks,btohqsg
How do u gauge in order not to contribute your car paint to the wall,btohqsg
if turning right  if you feel that your right tyre is near the centre of the lane  you're good,btohqsg
if there is no barrier between up and down vehicles then make it ~1/3 of the lane from the wall,btohqsg
If u not confident install blind spot mirrors,btohqsg
the driver side is reversed but the theory is same... turn right = right tyre middle of ramp,btohqsg
rmb what your instructor teach you lol,btohqsg
Just crawl dont care driver behind,btohqsg
Just get high beam or horn only,btohqsg
can i get your opinions on 2 sgcm listinghttps://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1170119https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1166091criteria for my selection is the price and depre as i dont want to take a car loan for new car until my housing loan is confirmed  also hence looking at 1-2 years left until I’m ready to look to buy a new car,btohqsg
If want 4 door just get lancer EX  the 2L manual is pointless if not a evo,btohqsg
Unless you wanna race like the fella who crashed on CTE,btohqsg
The koup is pretty good for short term drive,btohqsg
Oh didn’t realise it’s manual  not really interested in racing and also want to avoid tuned cars if possible. Have been seeing quite a few koups in my price range but just wonder if the 2 door will pose a problem. I guess it’s fine if only short term,btohqsg
every time after i crawled up  i was shaking all over,btohqsg
"From driver position I look across the front passenger  I align till the left mirror (Blue arrow) is ""touching"" the left wall if left spiral  at the same time you'll be able to see that your rear (car's  not yours 😂) gap with the wall. If spiral is right  then I align till my right wing mirror is ""touching"" the wall from driver view. It takes practice and is very accurate.",btohqsg
You try the city sq mall one  going up 😂,btohqsg
Or if you in the east,btohqsg
i rather park at hdb car park and walk over,btohqsg
it's turning right after the gantry,btohqsg

the building so old  the ramp confirm rabak,btohqsg
It's lift type rite? You ride the lift in the car  quite OK leh,btohqsg
i dunno if it's the lift type,btohqsg
Usually I check the car park in YouTube then chose the easiest 1 to park,btohqsg
omg... i din think of that,btohqsg
The carpark so small sia   I give it a miss,btohqsg
And then fix your turning angle once,btohqsg
After that maintain it by checking your mirrors,btohqsg
This one if it's 2 lanes,btohqsg
I think she's asking for 1 lane,btohqsg
Go IMM and up down up down a few times to practice,btohqsg
park at the nearby hdb car park,btohqsg
Lift one easy got the mirror all to help,btohqsg
Tampines is physically impossible not even skill issue for me,btohqsg
this kind of car park should demolish,btohqsg
how about those ppl driving SUVs??,btohqsg
wat's the largest one right now,btohqsg
velfire and alphard can go in or not,btohqsg
I park at the hdb  spacious,btohqsg
This is super right  angle of entry and exit 😂 very very important aspect. Makes a hell of a difference between 1 shot in or multiple shots still out.,btohqsg
Go do the Orchard central or capitalgreen and see if you'll vomit or not 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Never go cars and kopi sir,btohqsg
Chilling with my overpriced teh  now 😂,btohqsg

What is ur car… Tampines mall and century sq  both quite bad… Tampines one still ok,btohqsg
Tamp mall the entrance near the traffic light the turn very tight,btohqsg
That one even normal height car need to angle at times,btohqsg
I scratched my car at tampines mall. Century square not so much tight turns,btohqsg
But the exit of century sq is weird,btohqsg
Yeah… but i scratched my rims at tampines mall then I refuse to go there le,btohqsg
If you're going Tampines one and there's a queue  go to the HDB opposite,btohqsg
I cheapo bro i dont go HDB cuz not per entry there after 5pm🫠,btohqsg
I think that one height limit 1.7,btohqsg
I either park Tampines one or Tampines plaza,btohqsg
Just don’t get too tall one lor,btohqsg
My worst fear is buy alr u forgot height. Drive in BYE BYE ROOF,btohqsg
ESP when reversing into a lot which the back has a sloping metal piece,btohqsg
Under 1.8 is the best height for SUV,btohqsg
My boot roof almost kenna once,btohqsg
More than 1.8 like the defender all a bit hard to live with,btohqsg
No… it’s the reversing part that almost kenna hit,btohqsg
Just buy sports car. Low life best life!,btohqsg
I have a feeling this isn't just about sports cars,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check how do I bid for auction vehicles ?,btohqsg
There is a form at sgcarmart… fill up and send to the seller:) get ready your money 💰,btohqsg
Only car dealers can bid for auction vehicles via Quotz - J,btohqsg
can it just be a private entity or car dealer only,btohqsg
Must be car dealer. Not sure whether they will open it up to the masses in the future. I got ask before - J,btohqsg
Cuz if they open up to everyone  there's the worry that there will be people who just bid for fun and raise the price of the car - J,btohqsg
if they bid  just make sure they buy,btohqsg
But there are dealers who are willing to bid for you,btohqsg
anyone has bid on Mercs auction?,btohqsg
Very easy to create another account  so no point,btohqsg
need to be 1 step ahead and plug all the loopholes then,btohqsg
cannot be few blacksheet cut off everything sia,btohqsg
Tiagong have to be full cash ah,btohqsg
i believe for some auctions you can get a license to bid but you need to pay for the registration,btohqsg
most of the mercedes financial services ones,btohqsg
i tried searching for vehicle listed in sgcm  couldnt find,btohqsg
would be nice if we cud buy a car full cash upfront..,btohqsg
can get loan. but bank approval needs to be fast,btohqsg
and idk man... choosing my own insurance company? instead of being limited by the dealer?,btohqsg
they don't have listings up all the time,btohqsg
you can if you have the cash?,btohqsg
the listings were up in sgcm which directed me there,btohqsg
yeah BY PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE,btohqsg
that one you must negotiate with the dealer,btohqsg
i go with my fren before to see car,btohqsg
they prefer using their own insurance and loan cause it gives them comms,btohqsg
but you need to see who the dealer is,btohqsg
try to secure own loan  they don't add in too much in terms of pricing,btohqsg
and pick one with low early settlement charges,btohqsg
Technically you’ll still be paying lesser than if you were to loan,btohqsg
if you really want that specific car,btohqsg
If bank  after 1 year don’t have,btohqsg
now i know. lesson learnt already sometimes,btohqsg
for bank loan if ownself source,btohqsg
u need to determine the loan amount urself?,btohqsg
or issit like based on ur income  the bank will loan u X amount,btohqsg
maximum then its up to u to play,btohqsg
it's similar to a dealer sourced loan?,btohqsg
you choose how much you want to down,btohqsg
bank will give you a loan based on your income etc of a maximum of 70%,btohqsg
then you choose how much you want to avail,btohqsg
so if bank loan max amount for me is 100k  but the car i buy i only need loan 50k,btohqsg
so bank will just issue 50k?,btohqsg
erm that's not how it works,btohqsg
But hearsay rich people full loan their car,btohqsg
when you apply for a loan,btohqsg
yah i know one person that does it..,btohqsg
you will give them the price you're buying at,btohqsg
and how much you will put down,btohqsg
they won't anyhow issue loan one,btohqsg
cause the tenure and interest rate based on car age is different,btohqsg
tiagong is the person who said this,btohqsg
Also this is how shady dealers get you full loan too,btohqsg
but if there's no demand  there's no supply,btohqsg
yeah by inflating the price so that it looks like you paid the downpayment,btohqsg
there's enough and more uneducated buyers out in the market who don't understand the risk of full loans,btohqsg
and they see a way to start driving a car without forking out a hefty sum one shot,btohqsg
i always like to say this statement,btohqsg
instead just pay monthly as if they're using atome to buy the car,btohqsg
are there many people who full loan cars? risky business,btohqsg
they can always afford a car  what they can't afford is on the maintenance,btohqsg
yeah bro.. more than u expect,btohqsg
It genuinely surprises on how much people are willing to full loan,btohqsg
i see many luxury cars with very young drivers,btohqsg
oh some prolly insurance agents or property agents,btohqsg
that's what they realize after going into it,btohqsg
and they realize the monthly hard to maintain,btohqsg
and then they go to sell,btohqsg
but cannot meet full settlement price,btohqsg
because their deal was a shitty one,btohqsg
My civic is on the market right now,btohqsg
they say always live within your means.. but the trend is changing to live BELOW your means liao,btohqsg
monthly installment too high that even after selling they have to pay interest?,btohqsg
Literally everyone asked for full loan,btohqsg
u consign or direct owner ah,btohqsg
until now haven sell ah? faster sell lah,btohqsg
no more like the total amount they owe  they are unable to sell the car for that amount,btohqsg
if direct owner  how can you help them with full loan?,btohqsg
I loan him with my money,btohqsg
u sell  abit below market lo,btohqsg
if u want a quick sale,btohqsg
All want full loan but not everyone wanna pay 1.2k for a civic,btohqsg
No lah  not urgent to sell,btohqsg
I just put in the market  if sell then sell,btohqsg
u just dw drive cus maintenance hiong nia,btohqsg
im not saying u cannot afford ah dont get me wrong,btohqsg
yes but a man can be bored of other cars,btohqsg

A man can hit a woman if the woman keeps hitting the man,btohqsg
If the female do not lodge a formal complaint to SPF  police can’t do anything.,btohqsg
This is the right time to name and shame,btohqsg
Not when shops only accept cash,btohqsg
Criminal case do not need victim make police report,btohqsg
The person who record can submit a report since got veh license plate date and time,btohqsg

I hope that women is not Kelly Kimberly or Angela Lee 😜,btohqsg

Hi! Does anyone have affordable and trusted recommendation of mechanic for repair of scratches like this?,btohqsg
Need to respray whole panel sia,btohqsg
I have never buy a car before  looking to buy a pre-owned  it is possible to buy 1 without taking loan? Thinking to pay in full  it is possible?,btohqsg
Money only what  parf also can.,btohqsg
can save interest keep your car cheaper,btohqsg
Depends on how you want to invest your money. I bought my cars mainly with cash payment without loans. However  most dealers want you to pay more because they don't get the usual commission when a buyer takes a loan. This can be negotiated. I know of few car dealers who don't collect admin fee and don't charge extra for those paying full amount for the car. Cannot name these dealers here as need their permission to do so.,btohqsg
if you buy from direct owners  all that you need to pay is insurance  car and $25 transfer fee,btohqsg
as simple as transfer  the contract you can just use the sgcarmart template,btohqsg
as good as it gets  sometimes better than the dealers,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing about admin fees and other extra charges  I don't know what I don't know,btohqsg

What's so affordable about 86k cat A huh,btohqsg
86k divide by 10 yrs   1 yr only 8.6k nia … or 7yrs only 12.2k / yr . Still ok la   not that high,btohqsg
Some people spend on toto or 4D   may spend more than this amount easily .,btohqsg
Car also has cost  you can't drive a COE,btohqsg
But buying a car is like buying a package …. Unless the government remove the COE package lor … which you think they will ?,btohqsg
Just saying your calculation is just for a piece of paper,btohqsg
Oh sorry now environmentally responsible  paperless liao,btohqsg
No COE? U seee the jam every morning is 10 times worse than now,btohqsg
I know the jam early in the morning and during evening time . That why coe is part of the package for owning a car .,btohqsg

if cat A 86k  and a car cost 140k  depre also 14k per year,btohqsg
and 8.6 is more than 50% alr,btohqsg
so does it make sense a piece of paper depre cost more than the actual car?,btohqsg
How to see depre of a car ?,btohqsg
if the purpose of COE is really to reduce the jam  i wouldnt be stuck at CTE at 0 km/h during PEAK hours alr.,btohqsg

They give $$ not immediate effect . They tax   all these are with immediate effect,btohqsg
Many dealers will probably have to take the hit if they haven't already secured COE,btohqsg
Customers might take the hit in some cases and just work on financing,btohqsg
The van can Floor the pedal and keep beating red lights.That road can lead all the way to Woodlands/Admiralty and 😅,btohqsg

Increasing taxes for luxury cars:Those with open market value of more than S$40 000 will incur a higher marginal additional registration fee.https://cna.asia/budget2023live,btohqsg
I think the main problem is if cap at 60k  what is their intention? Give back lesser taxes? I feel its unfair lah. Imagine ur high end car parf 80k  then suddenly rebate now 60k. Govt eat 20k. Multiply the number of cars LOL,btohqsg
If 1 year deregister 100 of such cars  2million liao,btohqsg
