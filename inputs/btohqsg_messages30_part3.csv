If seller didn‚Äôt submit the endorsed documents  in the final stage after getting the completion date on time & the application cancelled  anyone know what will happen?,btohqsg
Write into HDB to ask ba,btohqsg
Then it won't be exercised. Did you ask their agent? Either: They are stalling for time or they changed their minds.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs already at the last step  we already got the completion date from HDB also   after1.5 month from today.Waiting response from the agent now,btohqsg
I fully understand  yes. They can wait till the last day  it's not wrong. Or  they can change their minds (you can sue for this).,btohqsg
Did they tell you about extension? Or say they needed time? If yes  then they are stalling.,btohqsg
Yeah initially  but negotiated price without any extension So completion date should be handing over the keys.,btohqsg
I have experience to mgt this  PM me,btohqsg
