i saw the vid of a congressman talking about his wife's anniversary while the topic in congress was a ufo sighting  by a high ranking airforce personnel,btohqsg
i dont think i have ever seen a 220 irl tbh,btohqsg
For Sinema I doubt Arizona will elect a Republican. For Manchin that one is a very dicey,btohqsg
220 probly risk headbutting the ISS,btohqsg
But even still they just need to maintain 50 assuming they get the president they desire. Also it ain't like last time... McConnell is like worse that Joe with his Dementia,btohqsg
Yeah so they will need a Democratic gain elsewhere. Polls show that the Republican challenger will likely gain Machin’s seat. But tbh even if Democrats lose their majority  it’s possible that Democrats filibuster the Republican’s agenda to the point they’re so frustrated and agree to vote to abolish the filibuster with the democrats,btohqsg
Also right now some votes cannot be filibustered as in the 2010s the senate voted on some rule changes,btohqsg
? I said even with Sinema gone Arizona will probably still swing Democrat,btohqsg
I wonder who will replace McConell lol,btohqsg
U talking about the Nuclear Option?,btohqsg
Yes but then if Trump wins  and Manchin’s seat flips  it’s going to be 50-50 with republicans getting the tie breaking vote,btohqsg
shit would be a long distance relationship at 135,btohqsg
"btw ""average height"" is misleading since it includes ppl of all generations",btohqsg
When a filibuster is use. Technically it can be overwritten by the nuclear option they did it for all senate nominations,btohqsg
but cant rly find average height by age,btohqsg
u can try finding other countries and doing a rough comparison,btohqsg
Can it be used for all votes?,btohqsg
I thought that was only for confirmation votes,btohqsg
rundown of the portion of vid to look for,btohqsg
They gott be really desperate if they use that,btohqsg
More likely than not according to current polling  which is why Biden should step aside but I guess he doesn’t want to give up the presidency having spent more than half his life trying to work his way up,btohqsg
Polling is like never accurate ngl. Also not to mention Trump literally has jail time inching over his head,btohqsg
fr..thats the mentality you have after spending 50+ yrs as a politican,btohqsg
trump on the otherhand been a businessman,btohqsg
He can pardon himself if he gets in office yes. But some are state criminal indictments,btohqsg
Remember when Polling consistently showed Hillary over Trump for 2016,btohqsg
Yeah  I mean like even if Biden as a president is more productive than Trump the mere fact that he is seen as a Washington creature could deter some voters,btohqsg
Yeah true  but it’s cos of the electoral college. And also pollsters can constantly adjust their polling methods and weightage to account for past errors,btohqsg
The electoral college is really backward imo,btohqsg
It was almost gone and if it did history would’ve been changed,btohqsg
Possibly no George w bush or trump,btohqsg
Like with a 2 round voting system  Al Gore and Hillary Clinton may have emerged as winners in the runoff,btohqsg
U mean Bush v Gore? Haha the Hanging chads,btohqsg
Yeah thanks to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court,btohqsg
Incredibly Al Gore conceded like a gentleman after the court decision,btohqsg
There probably would’ve been no Iraq War if Al Gore was president,btohqsg
I can’t decipher some of the words lol,btohqsg
Anyway the scotus needs to implement term limits and presidents shouldn’t be allowed to nominate justices,btohqsg
Right now the best thing that could be done would be to stack the Supreme Court,btohqsg
Also remove citizens united. Just look at Clarence Thomas and all his lavish gifts lol  over here it would be considered bribery,btohqsg
In the US if you’re rich you can buy over people in government,btohqsg
I mean the whole reasoning for no term limits is so they won't have to beholden to anyone,btohqsg
How does that work though  I don’t get how having term limits makes one beholden to the person that nominated them,btohqsg
Well no not really it's just the one who nominates them will do so based on their past decisions,btohqsg
So someone like Amy Coney Barett used to be super Conservative in past decisions but now in the 6-3 court she's considered a swing vote sometimes for majority opinions lmao,btohqsg
But how does not having term limits do that,btohqsg
Just they can do whatever they want,btohqsg
We still have justices like Clarence Thomas,btohqsg
So whatever they want means beholden to no one so ig some form of independence there,btohqsg
But like I mean term limits can be like 10 years and after that they can never be reappointed again,btohqsg
