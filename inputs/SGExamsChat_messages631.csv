"My Son c TikTok c that eat....video so he ask My Wife y Papa eat....but what I don't understand is that day Police come my houseüè°handcuff me arrest me y My Son knows really puzzled me because I didn't Post on Telegram that time when Police came but yet after school My Son can suddenly ask My Father""Wo Shi Bu Shi Mei You Papa Le?""& He can says Police come My houseüè†üè°catch me when nobody tell My Son anything",btohqsg
from like a normal train reviewerx not bad  wide windows (useless due to noise barriers  quieter than other trains  brighter (but ofc it's new) and announcements are way too loud üíÄ (idk why),btohqsg
yes i love fking noise pollutionesp since the first 3 generations of trains on NSEWL are gonna retire soon üò≠,btohqsg
whats so interesting abt trains tho,btohqsg
im obsessed with my fair share of things,btohqsg
i just see the engineering behind it,btohqsg
fyi the 3003 train  003/004  is gone now ü•≤,btohqsg
dont be pedo can alr i guess,btohqsg
i heard there's one train/bus enthusiast that got very influenced by an actual pedo (already arrested and in prison),btohqsg
he once privately invited a sec 2 kid for lunch,btohqsg
and all of his dms really just look fking pedophilic,btohqsg
If you are going to stay outside for a long time then i suggest you shower or smth,btohqsg
that just reinforces the stereotype ah,btohqsg
just one guy is enough for the public to consider the whole train community as pedophilic,btohqsg
i thought ur msg would be about that one p6 train otaku who delayed a train using a metal water bottle,btohqsg
lol jan last year there was an actual pedo train enthu in the sgexams disc server,btohqsg

Then take it as a learning exp,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt wanna end up my teammates carrying instead,btohqsg
at least you won‚Äôt die if you end up taking H2 without A math,btohqsg
Don't be so harsh on yourself ah   just reminder,btohqsg
It's good if u can do well also,btohqsg
i already tired from cca still got tuition at 8:30pm ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg

Eh when yall poly peep holiday ah,btohqsg
Iirc after cny is EOY ah,btohqsg
I rmb studying through chu yi,btohqsg
I have Wa1 after cny week sia,btohqsg
btw kuro yknow i realised my scholarship terms for teaching quite messed up for international students,btohqsg
double the amount of hours required,btohqsg
pay is one thing which is quite big but,btohqsg
i have to TA 208 hours 6 months before i graduate,btohqsg
oh ya senpai one of ur kouhai she want pxmell (it is listed on the chart they gave) but sch dw offer her because lack of demand so im scared they also dont give me my bcmh,btohqsg
Jokes on u I‚Äôm grad in 2026 also,btohqsg
perspective is if you teach 1 hour per week of tutorial for a sem you get about 50 hours of TA counted (prep time included ig),btohqsg
and only can TA after passing QE,btohqsg
so that‚Äôs like 3-4 sems of teaching,btohqsg
can anyone help me cause im legit scared i eont get bcmh,btohqsg
Damn they really want to overload u ah,btohqsg
bcmh should be common enough tho,btohqsg
actually idk the demand for h,btohqsg
cause everyone and their mother taking econs,btohqsg
Mf I'll have it and shove it up you next yr,btohqsg
ok like lab TA can do before qe but only for one sem bc need do TA course,btohqsg
thats my friends desired combi not mine üíÄ,btohqsg
Your sub combi q special sia,btohqsg
lit is actl interesting to me,btohqsg
We're on the same wavelength ig,btohqsg
"wanted to take lit in sec 3 even tho wasnt a subject combi  asked the cher can help me check says ""will get back to u"" and never did",btohqsg
okay should i make gifts for kiddies now or do reflections,btohqsg
"now im stuck with a hist cher that ""i will not teach the content in class""",btohqsg
but do random grp work for pointless things,btohqsg
like doing sbq do as a grp,btohqsg
I gave to my kids in kidsread,btohqsg
I gave them those DIY plane kits,btohqsg
The ones older gen used to play,btohqsg
idk im probably gonna make little cards for them the thing is i forgot their names üíÄ,btohqsg
just say thank you (pri sch name),btohqsg
but idk what to make sia legit,btohqsg
Literally pri sch kids they dgaf,btohqsg
"like ""each grp make 1 factor for the essay qn""",btohqsg
The cards I've received from them are literally printed from their teachers one,btohqsg
my teacher used to do that a lot but is because the class dgaf about hist and treat her like shit,btohqsg
But they did write their name like From (student name),btohqsg
i only rmb my sec 2 form teacher actually wrote us letters,btohqsg
And send to our home address,btohqsg
ok im gonna make like 30 cards for kids as farewell gifts,btohqsg
Because she said smth like she know we wont be receiving letters during our era,btohqsg
if i make more than required i can give to my friends on first day of sch,btohqsg
so i make more is btr than making less,btohqsg
Omg uk u can give like goody bag,btohqsg
I think after that then no passion le,btohqsg
my cher seems to be very serious about the class doing well  but i just dont get her teaching style,btohqsg
im too broke but i can give like little sweets or smth,btohqsg
"a little too ""holistic"" or wtv the artsy fartsy term is lol",btohqsg
ngl idk if this is a bad move,btohqsg
i have a ton of kiddy pencils in my house idt ill use,btohqsg
theyre like pencils with cutesy designs,btohqsg
When u go uni is all self study le,btohqsg
Just cherish what u have now,btohqsg
like 1 person a card and a pencil,btohqsg
cause they primary one so they will use pencil,btohqsg
self study but the teacher doesnt really teach anything,btohqsg
Just u dont understand what the fk they saying,btohqsg
U need to read before lesson to know what‚Äôs up,btohqsg
This one is just she lazy I guess?,btohqsg
but idt what we are doing in class is worth over not teaching content,btohqsg
Sec sch level is need to teach in class,btohqsg
Coz no one is gonna pre read,btohqsg
This reminded of smth funny  like when y'all go for uni lectures  the lecturer uses alot of v formal yet atas terms to convey what they want u to understand,btohqsg
in the end everything sounds so chim such that udk wtf they're talking,btohqsg
My prof spend 30 mins going through how a formula is derived from integrations and differentiations,btohqsg
idk I came across a ig reel post? Complaining abt that,btohqsg
Fella actually put it in exam asking us to show how it is being derived,btohqsg
how many words was req to write,btohqsg
Or was it proving by writing formulas,btohqsg
What if your eng is like DAMN good,btohqsg
my sch math got entire chapters is self study,btohqsg
I take engineering so english not really necessary,btohqsg
i mean you dont need to know literary devices la,btohqsg
As in no need to be top notched,btohqsg
but then i think need to like understand,btohqsg
omg someone ik said  she was deciding between pcmg and pcme but decided on pcme cause she think shes gonna need tuition for the humans subj and might as well take econs cause h2 econs tuition is more easy to find,btohqsg
and she doesnt rly have a preference,btohqsg
thats the dumbest shit ive heard this year other than ‚Äúsave palestine‚Äù,btohqsg
The year still early my guy,btohqsg
youll change ur words soon enough,btohqsg
U missed the dude that wanted to go mi,btohqsg
I am going to apply to MI. I heard that MI is only $6/month and has higher chance of going local uni. You also have 3 years to think about questions at a scenic pace and the cost in MI is less than in university because the MOE tuition subsidy only supports 4 years. If you prefer to extend to optimise results it is therefore less costly to do so in MI. You could also do this in JC if you retained or failed GP at the A level (and hence repeated J2).,btohqsg
@twosevenoffthe mi guy said the above in discord if you were wondering who he is,btohqsg
read a history book for once,btohqsg
why wld u have any sympathy for a race like themüò≠,btohqsg
ian do you consider urself to be involved or interested on sg politics,btohqsg
i dont want to be bc its really toxic,btohqsg
but more often than not i see things that piss me off and i tilt,btohqsg
alot of ppl my age dgaf about current affairs and stuff,btohqsg
and so i study more politics and philosophy to prove the idiots wrong,btohqsg
no way bruh the younger generation is all left and woke as hell,btohqsg
some ppl my age dont even know diff between president and prime minister of sg until teacher give a lesson,btohqsg
i thought thats one of the worst,btohqsg
They thought sg president have the power to pass bill.,btohqsg
all the idiot leftists i know are younger generations eh,btohqsg
i am y5 (jc 1)this year,btohqsg
maybe there is hope for humanity after all,btohqsg
oh btw today the class i was attached to  the class monitor said n word,btohqsg
Controversial but i feel like alot of ppl my age dont actl think about their own stance on a certain issue they js follow what is the popular viewpoint because they are afraid having a different opinion will cause them to become outcasted,btohqsg
btw this is not referring to a particular issue or current affair but a general trend,btohqsg
As a joke or uh lol,btohqsg
idk i just heard him say it lol,btohqsg
idk politics just made me feel that the average iq among the younger generation is depressingly low,btohqsg
some of these takes r absolutely retarded,btohqsg
supporting palestine and a terror group,btohqsg
needing to say pronouns in bio just to make 1-2% of the population happy,btohqsg
‚Äúbut palestine isnt hamas‚Äù ok then why did 86% of them vote for hamas,btohqsg
and look at what the palestinians did themselves,btohqsg
‚Äúthey dont have a state bc israel stole their land‚Äù ok then why did they reject a two state solution 3 times throughout history,btohqsg
bc their values say israel cannot exist,btohqsg
so a two state solution implies israel still exists and they cannot accept that in their religion,btohqsg
i avoid ppl with pronouns in bio like the plague,btohqsg
idc if theyre nice people if ure woke dont fking talk to me,btohqsg
isnt that like that painter guy,btohqsg
i swear palestine supporters are the dumbest bunch,btohqsg
science of language  mostly the spoken side like speech patterns etc  vs lit that‚Äôs more of analysing how people use their words in their world,btohqsg
oh AND as a singaporean if u support palestine ure especially stupid bc if not for israel we might be fucked,btohqsg
they helped us develop saf when we first became independent,btohqsg
so if u support palestine u abit,btohqsg
Wow damn that sounds so sophisticated,btohqsg
cb ppl help u when u weak,btohqsg
no u strong u turn ur back on them,btohqsg
ok palestine rant over bye bye,btohqsg
ok to lighten up the mood,btohqsg
Rmb to bring umbrella to touch,btohqsg
No need take leave.Off Day or after work can watch‚åö,btohqsg
our matador is developed with them,btohqsg
the same weapon we use to kill opfor is the same weapon they use to kill palestiniansü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
Actually should hav wait 4 sentencing 1st if no need go jail means no need cancel‚úñÔ∏è‚ùåstorage space,btohqsg
Not only that My Son knows is not üö´ just 1 Police but a Few Police came my house üè†üè† arrest me,btohqsg
Someone should make a kurt tay gpt,btohqsg
i mean if i were israeli u bet ur ass id be gg around killing civilians,btohqsg

he use the money from his telegram chat to pay for meals,btohqsg
and got troller prank him that he gonna be acting,btohqsg
den ask him meet at mediacorp,btohqsg

I only buy the rice if sch ends at 4pm or later,btohqsg
hmm can I check  if my sim card not available rn  will calling my telegram or WhatsApp still work :O,btohqsg
i only eat equivalent 1 and a half meal for the whole day,btohqsg
Breh I eat 20 times of this,btohqsg
Yesterday i eat this for lunch and didnt even feel like dinnering,btohqsg
and is tasty for the price,btohqsg
üéÇüç∞Cake diet (half swiss roll + 3Ô∏è‚É£ pieces mom bday cake  total of 8Ô∏è‚É£ pieces. Consumed previous 3Ô∏è‚É£ on 15th Dec)üëßüèªKairi try to get his attention (attempt so sing happy birthday)üë∫kurt ignores  just smile at makes little to no interaction (using phone  take food pics)  Just let her sit across him at bestüëßüèªKairi  aged 3 not sleeping despite being  12:30am (night),btohqsg
on the contrary i eat a lot at buffets,btohqsg
i js dont eat that much in sch because lazy,btohqsg
bruh I can eat 40 sets of mutton when I go for hotpot buffet,btohqsg
A summary of why Kurt snapped yesterday night and this morning:- 6/1/2024 was Kurt's daughter  Kairi  birthday and the family celebrated with her- Kairi opened Ah Kim's present first after the celebration and went to sleep before opening Kurt's present- Ah Kim forced Kurt to go work and this caused him to miss out the chance for him to film Kairi's reaction when she opens his present-  Kurt is angry because he never spends any time with his daughter and this is a rare opportunity to film his daughter- This is also one of the very rare times he buys a gift for Kairi as he spends all his money on $20 fast food and BDSM sessions.,btohqsg
lol i eat alot at hotpots and buffets but i dont feel like eating alot in schmaybe i eat one rice per week then the rest is waffles onigiri or smth that can fit in the palm of ur hand,btohqsg
petition for kurt tay and his wife to get a divorce,btohqsg
definitely a very difficult decision coming from somebody who has divorced parents,btohqsg
but sometimes it‚Äôs for the best,btohqsg
Man I'd die eating like that,btohqsg
I rmb one time when I was working PT   my work colleague literally said screw carbo and replaced rice with stir fried veggie,btohqsg
LOL look at that ice cube in that shot glass,btohqsg
the wife definitely didn‚Äôt deserve a husband like that to raise their kids,btohqsg
kurt is the equivalent of a dad who doesn‚Äôt care about his family and spends all the money on alcohol and etc,btohqsg
quite normal back in those days,btohqsg
when the dad come home drunk,btohqsg
i mean defo not asking u to be like one,btohqsg
I wasnt planning to :P how about that,btohqsg
not saying he is right btw,btohqsg
i like alcohol but I‚Äôll never be an alcoholic,btohqsg
Dude I don't make full use of my camera,btohqsg
i will never go home drunk and expecting somebody to take care of me,btohqsg
why tf u wanna be drunk,btohqsg
they drink because they wan to forget the shit they are going through,btohqsg
Oh ya I've been sober for the past few months,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been sober my whole life,btohqsg
my relatives just offered me alcohol and have a cheers with them,btohqsg
coz u can say wtv u wan and blame on being drunk,btohqsg
because i don‚Äôt go back to china very often,btohqsg
Idk how ppl can end up being one,btohqsg
like I seldomly drink it but whenever I do  I end up being thirsty asf and drink  alot of water,btohqsg
i naturally drink a lot of water so i don‚Äôt get drunk easily,btohqsg
drink until addicted because they spiral in,btohqsg
Ohhh ig I'm lucky cause I usu do that,btohqsg
i got one time i accidentally drink too much to the point i ended up going to sleep so early,btohqsg
it was one hell of a sleep,btohqsg
then the next morning my hand swelled for like a week and it was hell,btohqsg
explains why the one time i got actually drunk,btohqsg
i woke up feeling more energised lol,btohqsg
bc i drank a lot of water,btohqsg
but I FR no self control,btohqsg
i mean i rmb making a fool of myself in front of my then crush,btohqsg
Huh aren't u those cmi one,btohqsg

or get him to shout to someone else,btohqsg
anyway i‚Äôm just the sleepy drunk,btohqsg
how do uk you're drunk drunk,btohqsg
I feel like it varies from person to person,btohqsg
alcohol is for hand sanitizers  not for drinking,btohqsg
coffee bean should still have the 50% off lattes,btohqsg
Coffee is a diuretic which makes you pee more üò¨,btohqsg
Iw see drunk kuro and laugh,btohqsg
surprisingly i dont really feel the mental effects of being drunk but more of the physical effects,btohqsg
i only got drunk a few times at best so im wondering is it normal that when u got drunk  then sleep  wake up  go shower  then when u go back to your room and your entire room reeked of alcohol lol,btohqsg
Eh throughout the whole of ns must shave hair ah,btohqsg
i think bmt is number 1 but after bmt no need liao but still must keep short,btohqsg
