Yah sia.This the dilemma I‚Äôm in now.If I top up GPMC $5k with Absolute  that‚Äôs just a temporary solution.Then apply Amex TCB and cancel UOB Absolute might be the next thing I‚Äôll do.But if Amex tcb nerf grab top ups  gg liao.Maybe just apply Citi Cashback+ 1.5% MasterCard . I think no min spend. But suck thumb coz can‚Äôt use this for grab top ups. Won‚Äôt matter already by then coz the rewards to top up grab nerfed so might as well just pay income tax  HDB  insurance as per normal,btohqsg
Somehow that reveals your age group lol,btohqsg
Hmm Citi Cashback plus Master can use pay insurance to earn points?,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
i just got this SMS from UOB,btohqsg
Aiya I too late. Yesterday got Capita star 15% on grab app redemption,btohqsg
This is the worst nerf ever... But I guess I have no choice when I want to top up grab pay...,btohqsg
üëç can't we report to get it closed - it's so blatant fake and still using your face to scam people,btohqsg
Yesterday there was a Kevin learns investing scam chat,btohqsg
haiz  you can probably consider BOC zodiac card as well  1.6% cashback just like citi cashback+,btohqsg
But hor ladies n gentlemen I rethink again.If I have $5k  I not sure if it‚Äôs wise to top up GPMC before the nerf or should I just keep that $5k in SSB/cash funds  higher yield savings accounts that easily earn 3-5% now which is way more rebates than that measly 1.7% from UOB Absolute to Grab.Another perspective.,btohqsg
Need more people to report. Kelvin's one more jialat he not on Telegram to defend himself,btohqsg
That's what happened to me. I applied uob absolute and got nerfed withing 2 weeks.,btohqsg
Haha üòÜüòÜ but it expected look at all the nerf recently it just matter if Time,btohqsg
That's why I apply other as backup,btohqsg
This deserved a video.Ie for those of us who already have a favourite card but want a backup credit card to mop up misc spending above quota and without minimum spend (and annual fees if possible).I only know CIMB cards no annual fees and trust Bank cards,btohqsg
I guess I shouldn't apply for tcb. If not amex will Nerf everyone again,btohqsg
Agreed. Grab goes down  and bring everyone along with it. All good things come to an end eventually.,btohqsg
I am just worried the amaze+ Citi combo get nerfed,btohqsg
I saw online that annual fee waiver for CRMC is 'N/A while other cards have a 'tick''  does it mean we cant call in to waive the fee after the first year?,btohqsg
Enjoy the double triple dip while last,btohqsg
Probably no annual fee evenSome banks like CIMB  Trust have cards that don‚Äôt have annual fee forever,btohqsg
just checking here first  because a lot of yall using this card for v long alr,btohqsg
Now I‚Äôm just wondering‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point of having UOB Absolute even since converting it to MasterCard using Grab only gets me 0.3%. No one will top up Grab le. Final nail in the coffin.,btohqsg
Amex TCB 1.5% + Grab is the only alternative. But we too don‚Äôt know how long this will last.,btohqsg
From my own research  seem like as long as one spends about $6k on UOB Absolute in a year  they will waive the annual fee of $192.60,btohqsg
It seems like the cashback game is getting tougher by the day,btohqsg
Don't worry about annual fees that have not been charged.,btohqsg
Lol. Same here. Just got my card yesterdayüò≠,btohqsg
The banks are showing us who‚Äôs boss and keeping all of us back in line. End of the day we end up just spending on their cards as they intend us to.,btohqsg
Cannot canceled within 6mths or else kena penalty fee right?,btohqsg
Uob absolute still have their advantage like hospital bills and i also use it for service or purchase of ecapitavoucher when there is promotion that is open for any catd,btohqsg
Not that I need hospital services at this moment.,btohqsg
But anyway uob will see usage drop after the nerf that is for sure,btohqsg
Education also count and other gov service,btohqsg
someone mentioned of citi casback plus do accept insurance payment to earn points ?,btohqsg
now capita star app got 10% bonus for every $100 bought with DBS/POSB credit/debit card. Min $100 per top up up to 5x. i.e. total $100 x 5 over 5 days earns u $50 bonus.,btohqsg
Ya i share that day ago,btohqsg
Sometime they dont limit what card so i use uob amex to get 1.7 percent. Dbs dont give rebate or point for evoucher purchase,btohqsg
right now i'm  tryign to find use case for UOB Absolute... it's purpose is to fund GPMC for payments that were otherwise non-eligible for credit card rewards. I mean we can still top up GPMC  and earn 0.3% vs not earning anything at all.,btohqsg
usually if u cancel after 6 mths  there's no penalty fee and technically shouldn't affect credit score.,btohqsg
to sign up as new customer  some banks typically require that u had not owned any cards for previous 1 yr also.,btohqsg
supplmentary card user dont count as a old user of bank i suppose,btohqsg
Looks like it‚Äôs time to get amex tcb card,btohqsg
dont cry later kanna nerf and say omg i just got the card and it got nerfed,btohqsg
i use UOB Absolute for CapitaStar eVoucher purchase during their promos. This card practically gets us 1.7% on most things that are normally excluded by other cards which is the pull of the card.,btohqsg
be mentally prepared AMEX don't nerf grab top-Ups,btohqsg
buy voucher most card dont earn points?,btohqsg
most cards dont count buying vouchers as eligible spending to meet their quota. It's coz the MCC code that the voucher is under is excluded. So u need to test if unsure.,btohqsg
Yup for other card  only amex capita card  uob amex and amex truecashback give rebate for ecapitavoucher purchase,btohqsg
