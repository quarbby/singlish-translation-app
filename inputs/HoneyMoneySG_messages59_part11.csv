Or does only apply to selected merchants if payments are made on the amaze card,btohqsg
Any trades to recommend for moomoo to fulfill 5 buy trades for sign up gift?,btohqsg
If i only have less than 10k savings isit recommended for ocbc 360 now that gxs is kinda useless,btohqsg
Their 3.5% is perm? Any other conditions?,btohqsg
You need to read this if you decide to use Citi reward.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
not permanent until Jan 2024  you can checkhttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.html#New%20Customers%20  not really that difficult,btohqsg
Gxs announced the drop in int rate for saving account to 2.68%. But main acc has an inc of int rate to 2.38%. How does it affect us?,btohqsg
actually I interpret that then as each day's end balance is compared against 31st July.. so if you add all the daily comparisons up in a mth  u actually get a avg mthly balance so I guess they are not really wrong in a way...,btohqsg
rate drop is the big difference  from 3.48% to 2.68%,btohqsg
If you have $75k in the GXS pocket  your daily interest will be drop from $7.15 to $5.50. About $49.50 per month or $600 per year.,btohqsg
Tks guys. I feel gxs dropped in the rate too quickly. Just offered the perks then now like u turn.,btohqsg
Can hear some advices if that's the case  is uob one or uob stash the best saving account with the best int rate now?,btohqsg
Uob one is best for 100k  5% if you hit the credit card spending and salary,btohqsg
If you don't want another card or you aren't drawing income  then stash is 3%.But uob one salary quite easy to hit. Cause can use fast from another bank,btohqsg
If I only can have 50k  shld I change from gxs to uob one? Or it won't matter much hence can remain at gxs?,btohqsg
Actually any risk in using this hack? Come tax filing time  will our income become more and get taxed more?,btohqsg
Tks xing xing. If 50k sav then only can fulfilled salary credit of 2k. No spending. Can I get 3% interest? Or can get more pls?,btohqsg
1) Are you able to spend $500 on credit card every month?2). How much saving we are looking at? UOB one 5% best for $100k saving.3). Are you able to lock in your cash for 4 months?4). Are you able to increase your saving by at least $500 every month?,btohqsg
Honestly no idea. Not iras  not sure what they count as income. But transferring your money between banks isn't taxable by right,btohqsg
Tks hunter. I'm looking at 50k sav  no spending. Salary credit at 2k.,btohqsg
Without 500 spending uob one is base interest. Would not recommend,btohqsg
Stash is better for your case I think.,btohqsg
Nice. But the page didnâ€™t state which mcc is excluded  dunno izzit same as the 1% promo?,btohqsg
"for CIMB do i need to open both current & savings? webpage use ""and"" but t&c use ""or""",btohqsg
If you're new to uobThere's a promotion.50k into uob stashYou get some cash,btohqsg
How many months you are willing to lock your fund without withdrawing?,btohqsg
Oh I have a uob sav account opened many years back. Hence dont think I'm considered new.,btohqsg
No need to be new to bank for the national savings promo. The earmarked amount aka 50k is incremental,btohqsg
If put less than 100k in UOB one can still get their high interest?,btohqsg
If I'm looking at no locked in and saving account  any other bank better than gxs?,btohqsg
I see. Tks. I'll check out at uob,btohqsg
Can but first 60k is 3.85-3.9,btohqsg
You can use the calculator on web to find out how much you will get.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
Have. Already enjoying the 1% on those spendings that other cards exclude but fsm did not exclude the mcc.,btohqsg
No locked in can consider CIMB Fastsaver and SIF Gosaver kinda,btohqsg
Hmm no lock in wise  uob stash is still OK but the higher interest is on incremental savings. So you can take money out but the balance drops and it will still be base interest which is... 0.05%?,btohqsg
If she new to cimb the interest of 3.5% is incremental amount also. Under tnc. If not its base interest of 1.5%,btohqsg
I will be new to cimb. No acc with cimb,btohqsg
The words are å‹‰å¼ºcorrect but the table is very very wrong.,btohqsg
UOB stash has lock in n cannot withdraw or else you loss all your interest earned on that month if monthly average balance is less than previous month.,btohqsg
I thought its just the bonus interest. Base interest is paid regardless of amount,btohqsg
How many percent is base interest?,btohqsg
So if you don't think your account balance will increase every mth don't use uob stash,btohqsg
So we are taking about either you get $125 per month without withdraw or you get $2.08 per month if you withdraw it on $50k saving on Stash.,btohqsg
is there any possible scenario where this doesn't work for hitting credit card min spendbasically have shopee store  purchase from yourself using another account/number.  use untracked shipping. after a few days just mark as complete.only downside i can think of is eat about 4-5% in commission to shopee,btohqsg
