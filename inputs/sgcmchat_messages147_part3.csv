Where do you go to find imports?,btohqsg
"they might have the ""rarity charge""",btohqsg
If I keep my current car,btohqsg
If I live like a peasant in all other aspects LOL,btohqsg
imo if you want a decent classic to keep  can look at Honda City Turbo II,btohqsg
think the price is not bad either,btohqsg
Uh I can send u a spreadsheet ah but it’s mostly1.YahooAuc2. USS Tokyo3. Respect Motors4. Goonet5. Bforward,btohqsg
the turbo ii is a baby baby nsx,btohqsg
There r a lot ah but these are the more reputable-ish ones,btohqsg
If uw cheaper u go Japan hunt,btohqsg
does the nsx come with a motocompo?,btohqsg
buy 1 vehicle get 1 free,btohqsg
If nsx dreams don’t come true then likely I’ll just play the daily driver,btohqsg
And enjoy a 987 or 718 or emira a decade later,btohqsg
what's the daily as of now?,btohqsg
SBS but sometimes I take the SMRT out for a spin,btohqsg
Need to figure out 1m rear fender conversions,btohqsg
Doesn’t seem like an easy job,btohqsg

with the power of alcohol anything is possible,btohqsg
Lye doesn’t even do custom kits now,btohqsg
Like they’ll install something for you and make it fit,btohqsg
But they won’t make it from scratch,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll go try lidar scanning an actual 1m,btohqsg
Then ask China if they’ll make it LOL,btohqsg
But the rear fenders are truly a huge job. Not just a swap job like front fenders,btohqsg
Then probably need a 1m bumper and trunk lid idk,btohqsg
im sure they might have some kits for the fenders,btohqsg
Replacing anything breaking with a better version of it,btohqsg
