Hi all I‚Äôm planning to apply Amex true cashback card. First time for Amex. Already have UOB ONE CC as main card and planning to use Amex cc for 50 to 100$ per month. Will Amex waive annual fees like other bank or any special ?,btohqsg
If u don't need the cash  u gain higher interest from RA.,btohqsg
As with most cards  depends on your annual spend. It‚Äôs an internal guideline which is not revealed.,btohqsg
I remember I read somewhere that part of the RA return are in shared pool n cannot be withdrawn because it does not belongs to yours anymore. Any idea how much from RA will be allocated to shared pool ?,btohqsg
Oops! Yeah  forgot abt that.So  I suppose it depends on how much monthly payout u want from RA.If u can manage well yr OA  then no issues lor. But if u feel u may anyhow use OA  then maybe good to have higher monthly payout from RA.,btohqsg
Hiii sorry i might be blind but I searched this and couldnt find anything related üôÅ Just to clarify  it would be repaying DBS bank a student loan and not actually paying school fees directly (just graduated) thank youuuu!,btohqsg
"Anyone had problem link UOB lady mastercard to amaze? It states ""unable to link your bank card""   card issuer has rejected the request. Wonder if i miss out any settings",btohqsg

From Mile Lion‚ö†Ô∏è PSA: Linking UOB cards to AmazeIf you've been trying to link a UOB card to Amaze over the past few days  you may have encountered an error message. It's not just you. There is currently a system-wide issue which prevents adding new UOB cards to Amaze.The issue does not affect already-linked cards  so you can continue to use your UOB Lady's Card etc. with Amaze as per normal.Amaze and UOB are currently pointing the finger at each other  so fingers crossed this gets resolved quickly and without further drama.,btohqsg
Answering my own question  seems possible. Checked using cardup calculator.,btohqsg
Says specifically in the terms and condition that CardUp isnt qualified spending for the 4000$  but says nothing about Wise,btohqsg
Anyone subscribed to HSBC Short duration bond 4.55% on moomoo? Is it similar as MMF can withdraw anytime without penalty?,btohqsg

Cant find anything about Wise specifically  might need to check with DBS.,btohqsg
Check TransferWise MCC onheymax.ai  then check against the t&c.,btohqsg
Yea just saw the MCC exclusion for cardup under vantage. Dint know that as i was using the cardup calculator.,btohqsg
