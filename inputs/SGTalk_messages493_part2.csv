not to bury your emotions of grief and sadness  maybe anger and bitterness  but to acknowledge and help redirect your brooding away from what is destructive and unhelpful to you as someone your family / relative loved.,btohqsg
So the best is to keep myself busy,btohqsg
a large part of it  but you also still need time to acknowledge and deal with the missing parts of your emotions / life / relations,btohqsg
Thank for the advice. I try my best to go through it,btohqsg
know that you're not alone in this world  seek close friends and other relatives who may be similarly hurting. no one will hurt like you do  but also  you will not hurt like they do. it is important not to deny the pain and grief.. but also to not deny others' sense of loss,btohqsg
find something that does not have any negative impact for you to focus on and dive deep into it  it will help better distract you üí™ can be a hobby  something you always wanna do but didn‚Äôt or dun have the push. Channel your sadness into it ü´°,btohqsg
