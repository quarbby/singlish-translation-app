Delete and join using 2 new accounts,btohqsg
Try joining a pre organized one instead of organizing yourself. If you try booking yourself quite ex and a lot of permits and things to take care of. Quite mafan. Plus no slots available until q3  maybe even q4 for the year because so many track days booked already,btohqsg
@adminI don't know what to say  I guess you can just take note,btohqsg
