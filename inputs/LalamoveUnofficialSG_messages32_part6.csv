But you can stack with grab hitch,btohqsg
Saw 2 order all say got people tag along,btohqsg
I am sure we can figure something out  so far the pick up time  destinations setting has been working correctly from the comments of other users.👌May i know did you encounter any other problems? We keep updating our app on a daily basis to meet your needs❤❤,btohqsg
Many users shared the same worry of you  but through out our 5 years operation in different countries  0 driver was banned!!!😊😊Actually we were thinking about simplfing the app for the sg users as some replys suggested that they were not familiar with the app (Of course you can find me to help😊)  but maybe adding more criteria would suit you better? If that is true please let us know so that we can change the app for you💪💪🙆   !!!,btohqsg
Masters can advise if this is doable??,btohqsg
I personally wouldntStacking best either pick up same shop or at most  side by side locationAnd destination going 2 opp directions even if 1st loc is nearby,btohqsg
