I can be better but still healthy in general!,btohqsg

Shud I get a dekitted b12 pro kit,btohqsg
a lot of people sell when got leak,btohqsg
He changing to coilovers thats why selling,btohqsg
Idw get new cus car listed. I just think my suspension wonky  cus it keep creak when full load or maybe just chs my friend big size. He 150kg,btohqsg
springs can buy but not absorbers la,btohqsg
FULL LOAN USE THE MONEY U HAVE TO INVEST,btohqsg
Oh you're thinking what I'm thinking too,btohqsg
This is correct and good advice 👍🏼,btohqsg
Coz it’s your Mama who gave birth to you who is the healthiest!!!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰,btohqsg
full load does not account for potholes,btohqsg
but i think just my frens cus they bigger in size. colleagues no problem,btohqsg
Creak I kinda don’t think it’s your absorber sir,btohqsg
Have your undercarriage checked out perhaps first before you go buy a set of new absorbers… and the moment you drive out of the workshop  CREAK!,btohqsg
i get it checked out next servicing,btohqsg
Cant wait. Better drive more so the mileage use up faster. Rounding time!!!,btohqsg
google says its mostly suspension joints wearing out ..,btohqsg
Wah! I actually said something that made sense!!,btohqsg
I have another solution to offer,btohqsg
Stop giving rides to your 150kg friend!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
But more to your skinny female colleagues in office,btohqsg
but fren mah many years alr leh,btohqsg
6 7 years of knowing each other,btohqsg
we always go eat good shit tgt one,btohqsg
How much you guys normally play?,btohqsg
3 6 half i can win over $100 dollars,btohqsg
Google also say i got covid if I got fever,btohqsg
Next you will say data expensive,btohqsg
Go National library download. Free wifi and best part is lots of car maintenance books there de,btohqsg
I spend my nights there learning how to maintain cars I can’t afford 😅,btohqsg
hahahaha apparently some apps claim can linking to it,btohqsg
And you did have COVID when you had fever,btohqsg
No need download  just put the webpage on your home screen as an app icon,btohqsg
Basically an app at that point,btohqsg
March 2023: COE supply projected to fall uniformly  even as Cat A  B and E premiums all stand at record highs 🚗📉It appears that the end of sky-high premiums may not yet be in sight  as slowing de-registrations suggest that the COE quota for May to July is set to fall. 🧐➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Comment and share (nicely) whether you agree with our editor and your thoughts on this issue!,btohqsg
wahahahaha the censored graph got me,btohqsg
Does a high COE price mean a higher car resale value? Let's find out!https://www.sgcarmart.com/news/writeup.php?AID=692&CT=a,btohqsg
Just means if coe shoots up  used car market cannot shoot high until it turns off buyers away,btohqsg
But I've seen it'll be somewhere same depre as used,btohqsg
Not entirely true. Higher loan interest rate  rising ERP and petrol cost will deter buyers from buying cars if dealer mark up the price too high. Consumer will go for grab or rent car for short term instead,btohqsg
Not sure ur explanation is logical but anyway it's ur opinion and i respect it.,btohqsg
The qn is if a coe car and a parf car same model diff gen but same depre why wud I get it,btohqsg
I seen some coe car depre insane,btohqsg
Exactly. Of course I'm not desperate to get car right now until price is stabilise a bit given singapore small size and convenient public transport. There's no financial lost to me if I don't buy a car. Only car dealers will lose money for each day their cars are parked in their garage.,btohqsg
Without car  I can still travel to anyway in SG. Got grab  got taxi  got mrt  etc. There's always alternative to every products,btohqsg
This statement a bit misleading. Not every car. And depends on many factors,btohqsg
Every business depends on market demand and supply. I'm not grab driver so I have no rights to says can make a lot of money or not,btohqsg
Shimano Singapore takes delivery of new Skoda Octavia Combi 🚗Skoda and cycling go back a long way since the company was founded as a bicycle manufacturer  before moving into making cars.Celebrating their 50th year of bicycle component manufacturing in Singapore  it is unsurprising that Shimano Singapore has continued its relationship with Skoda with the purchase of a new Octavia Combi.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
Is this profit after deducting your makan  petrol  car maintenance cost or whatever?,btohqsg
How many trips per day? Ur every trip always 139?,btohqsg
Can I report fake news anot,btohqsg
FzI think u r being arrogant.  U also nv answer me on average how many trip u do per day and what is ur operating costs etc,btohqsg
U just keep saying make profit,btohqsg
Not everyone here are grab driver,btohqsg
Quality like shit  the got the bottom right corner that one,btohqsg
honestly i starting to doubt this guys is pete liao... because he's even dumber,btohqsg
And u buy used car that left 6 months every 6 months?,btohqsg
Not everyone can do like u,btohqsg
Ur reason of buying cars to earn profit is for Grab. But not everyone here buy for Grab. Some buy for family or for other reason. So earlier on  it's not correct for u to say that car  in general  can earn u profit. Its quite misleading becos ur profit only applies to u only.,btohqsg
Where got everyday have $60 trip,btohqsg
too bad i dont like people to sit my car,btohqsg

But Sgcarmart must tied down with the car dealer then can benefit the interested buyers.,btohqsg
Actually you can just apply for the loan and bring it to your used car dealer - J,btohqsg
We helping dealers clear their inventory - J,btohqsg
no leh some dealers dont l et me take own loan,btohqsg
true! you can check out our used car listings from time to time. there are some dealers who are onboard with this new loan initiative already,btohqsg
Ya dealers insist we take their loan don't allow us take your loan leh,btohqsg
Who are the dealers so we can see their inventory,btohqsg
Probably doesn’t work for COE cars,btohqsg
i'm waiting for the reply - J,btohqsg
You ah don’t work for COE cars,btohqsg
nope cannot full loan must be min 30% down,btohqsg
correct. PARF cars only for now,btohqsg
there is no pro smart loan dealer  we will curate a list of cars inside sgcarmart to help the dealer to convert sales using our smart loan  for those who cannot find the CTA  they can contact our smart loan hotline directly and apply with our staff.,btohqsg
you will see this button on a used car listing,btohqsg
if you have any further enquiries regarding the smart loan  you can send them herewa.me/6591386924,btohqsg
Not available for new car ?,btohqsg
haven sell my current car yet  next dealer unknown,btohqsg
Most dealer I spoke too said they don't partner or accept sgcarmart loan becos they don't receive commission. They prefer we consumer takes loan from banks or in house and some more longer loan terms. It seems that consumer isn't king when comes to buying car.,btohqsg
We have play by the dealer's book,btohqsg
Experience a recent case where I told a dealer I wasn't interested in taking a more than 50% loan amount and 5 years tenure  within 10 seconds he immediately said the car is sold.,btohqsg
lmao just let him rot with the car,btohqsg
Until today the car is still listed. I don't want to name the dealer but it has a local celebrity as their brand ambassador. U can figure yourself but I will definitely avoid such dealer,btohqsg
To be Frank  owning a car is already so expensive and stress  they still want to come up this kind of pattern.,btohqsg
that's why some ppl they take the loan,btohqsg
1 month ltr pay it off,btohqsg
pay extra 2k just so we cover ur loan commission when we wanna do full cash,btohqsg
He didn’t name Toh. He named San Hup Been,btohqsg
If i receive a complain  i'll have to delete this yeah? - J,btohqsg
highly doubt u will ah HAHAH,btohqsg
I generally don't like to delete people's msgs (unless your name starts with P and rhymes with meet),btohqsg
J U TOLD ME DONT TOXIC,btohqsg
can i just complain abit of how my car needs to replace a $12 clip but the labour fee is 250 dollars,btohqsg
But anyway I have a bad experience with them so,btohqsg
Super inflexible on loan and insurance,btohqsg
did u end up buying the car from them tho,btohqsg
Luckily first thing I asked them was whether I could use my own bank and insurance,btohqsg
They said no so no deal lo,btohqsg
a dealer ask me top $200 when i wanted to use my own insurance,btohqsg
They need to earn somewhere I guess,btohqsg
"What i learned from the internet is that Car dealers earn the following comms:Bank loansInsuranceAdmin and other hidden feeCar salesSo u may think they often put their ads  ""drive away with 0 to few hundreds or thousands downpayment"" is a good deal for u. In reality  we have to pay for higher loan interest over 5 to 10 years. Not to mention Car maintenance cost  road tax  insurance  petrol  etc as well",btohqsg
Paisei mah   a bit busy so must stop at where I left 😂😂,btohqsg
Sales comm is for the salesman,btohqsg
And it comes out of the first 3 things you mentioned,btohqsg
The first 3 things go to the dealer,btohqsg
"As a consumer  we just need to be smart and not let our emotions give away. If I see a nice car I want  I will just say ""not bad  let me compare with other dealers first "". I will take it slowly. I don't show them my desperation. That's how ppl make wrong financial decisions",btohqsg
Dealer will then disburse a part of it to salesman as his comm for selling the car,btohqsg
The rest is covering their costs and profits,btohqsg
Also cannot  ADs ask you to get at least one out of two from them,btohqsg
No need to worry too much,btohqsg
if their loan int rate is low,btohqsg
insurance is really see which one u prefer,btohqsg
"Or if you don't take loan from them  your promo price will disappear because ""the car is only for *brand name* financial services""",btohqsg
So it cannot be put under other finance schemes,btohqsg
Usually I get insurance . The current car   the insurance is tied down with. Bundle of 3 yrs,btohqsg
Cause if they can offer you lower insurance and lower interest rate,btohqsg
Easier for them to convince you to buy also,btohqsg
They quoted me 1st yr 2.2 k,btohqsg
Erm full loan very different (0 DRIVEAWAY) that one is in house finance only so cannot compare,btohqsg
Then I say if you can quote me 3 yrs with 3k insurance I take from you .,btohqsg
You cannot secure own loan for that unless you ask loan shark,btohqsg
They give it to me .,btohqsg
But   the 2nd driver needs to be 40 and abv then can drive,btohqsg
i no NCD also not so expensive sia,btohqsg
So need to work out something for them to learn the comms,btohqsg
pls tell us the workshop that provide $33 engine oil if not its fake news,btohqsg
Got so many combinations that you can run for all to be happy in the deal,btohqsg

that's why sometimes we dun reply HAHHA,btohqsg

I don't know if there's any nice way to say this but,btohqsg
Most people with nice cars don't necessarily do grab in general.....,btohqsg
All this while I’ve been driving grab to cover cost,btohqsg
I don’t wanna pay for a car out of my salary,btohqsg
So I can still have my salary while paying $0 for a car (technically la),btohqsg
huh then need stick that stupid sticker,btohqsg
i lost my PHV license woops cant drive grab anymore,btohqsg
i just work an additional job to cover the instalment actually,btohqsg

How much time do you spend on grab a day?,btohqsg
I working 3 jobs and 7 days a week🫠,btohqsg
Pet dad is not a job sir,btohqsg
Plus whenever I get off work or go to work  I’ll set My destination which works for me. Higher fare than hitch also,btohqsg
Shut up. You don’t know what it’s like.,btohqsg
But then again because I only work 3 days a week  I use my off days to drive.I can’t sit still at home anyway,btohqsg

Maybe is either car or driver problem liao LOL  you’re talking to someone who used COE A5 cabrio last time to do lalamove leh,btohqsg

You can drive a stock conti and be happy,btohqsg

Drive jap/korea car is the best,btohqsg

Reliable or not doesn’t matter  I want a car that I like  and I’m doing grab to cover abit of cost,btohqsg
Get ready for everything to piang,btohqsg

so dont want it to affect our way or standard of living,btohqsg
just means we need find some other means to sustain,btohqsg
You wanna suan people who have PHV decal on their conti go ahead,btohqsg
But nothing wrong with driving a jap/korea car bro,btohqsg
I said it basing on the price to what you’re getting out of it,btohqsg
i just dun wanna do grab cus insurance cost go up  then that sticker also means subjected to more rules..,btohqsg
if sky is happy with what he is doing,btohqsg
Lmao I’ve seen people driving 7 series for grab and limo service I still look up to them.They can do whatever they want with that car  if they can afford the 7 series thu whatever means then good for them,btohqsg
i think he just meant with the pricing they are at now  its just not value for money as compared to getting a BMW,btohqsg
But better to drive jap/korea cars for grab,btohqsg
which i agree in term of maintenance cost wise,btohqsg
last time i use jap car rent ah  really better. FC wise cus not hybrid  but the car solid..,btohqsg
like overweight ppl come in full load,btohqsg

BMW M4 driver involved in fatal Tanjong Pagar crash requests to leave Singapore  gets called a 'flight risk'She may have hit 181km/hr on a 50km/hr road 😱➡️ Read the full storyHERE!,btohqsg
Why are we still talking about this sia,btohqsg
Cause got A5 B9.5 pop pop,btohqsg
Apparently she drove before the other driver took over snd crashed,btohqsg
she drunk drive before they crash also,btohqsg
Let the poor lady go on with her life,btohqsg
She already got her fine and conviction sir,btohqsg
She's not subject to jail time,btohqsg
And that's not a flight risk,btohqsg
Actually don't quote me on this one I don't remember what the ST article said about how long the driving ban was but this article mentions 3 months,btohqsg
Isn’t flight risk mean she will be risky to take flights,btohqsg
she was on flight risk previously before she was convicted mah,btohqsg
If you're not allowed to leave the country that's a no fly list put out by CAAS and ICA in the case of Singapore,btohqsg
Why she risky to take planes,btohqsg
You don't know the difference between the two I suppose,btohqsg
er no flight risk just means the probability that they run and never come back/attend court. like the covid china couple  they considered flight risk. but No Fly List - means the person got banned by an airline  usually common in US,btohqsg
flight risk in this case just refers to the chance they will take flight --> Not necessarily mean evading via air mah. technically when the court considers her a flight risk  she can't take plane or travel out via our land  sea and air checkpoints le,btohqsg
