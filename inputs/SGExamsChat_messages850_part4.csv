I’ll send my working let me just write out on paper properly,btohqsg
I equated x² + y² + z² = x + y + z = 1,btohqsg
we need some g(x) = 0,btohqsg
Oh I just used two Multivariate constraint functions,btohqsg
I can only find two pts ,btohqsg
I got the constraint y = z,btohqsg
But at the end I could only find 2 pts that fulfilled the conditions,btohqsg
I found my Lagrange multiplier to be λ = -1,btohqsg
Do we have to find it tho,btohqsg
but i just found it somehow,btohqsg
Yeah I just used one to simplify my work,btohqsg
You’re taking fmath or are u in uni?,btohqsg
Just got my O Level results,btohqsg
Brother why are u doing Multivariate calc in sec sch,btohqsg
I want to maximize the area of my Minecraft farm,btohqsg
We need more people like you in math degrees,btohqsg
why would you need lagrange multipliers for that lol,btohqsg
surely there are easier ways to do it,btohqsg
yeah i could AM-GM or somethingbut where's the fun in that?,btohqsg
Maybe he wants to maximise it with the constraint of the amount of wood he has to build fences,btohqsg
Sounds a bit overkill but no judgement here,btohqsg
@aitkentangdoes your module cover stuff like gauss' theorem,btohqsg
That gave me ptsd i didnt need to see,btohqsg
so bro goes in ns  come out go private ..does well goes to a normal poly. all before he turns 20,btohqsg
are the laws regarding vehicles in army diff?,btohqsg
if not he could have learnt how to drive a truck before turning 19,btohqsg
Yes but not so early on,btohqsg
I doubt he can ride one... but to be far,btohqsg
Possible but probably like driving mrt train,btohqsg
By the time he ord  he would be 18 anyways haha,btohqsg
Like license only valid for driving train in certain area,btohqsg
all i know is if you serve ns  you dont need to wait 1yr between car to truck like normal civs do,btohqsg
Just like pilot license has limits too,btohqsg
I’m doing a stats degree and i thought u meant the Gaussian,btohqsg
Asking if you cover stuff like vector fields  rotor and divergence etc,btohqsg
No I decided against that cause I wanna be employed in the future,btohqsg
I get the appeal tho  I’m taking some pure mods and it’s fun,btohqsg
I just don’t wanna do topology and shit,btohqsg
is one of them group theory,btohqsg
i could go on for hours about algebra,btohqsg
No im doing analysis this year,btohqsg
Planning to do real and complex analysis next year,btohqsg
U know in uni they have analysis 1 and 2 before u start a dedicated real analysis mod,btohqsg
Yeah but as a stats major u kinda gotta be Goated at real so u can do measure theory in y3 or 4,btohqsg
Planning to do mathematical stats as a masters cause I wanna get behind the theory and proofs,btohqsg
I have a bookStatistical Inferenceby Casella and Berger,btohqsg
Oh yes I heard that this one is really good,btohqsg
Gives a decently rigorous treatment  introducing Komolgorov's Axioms,btohqsg
It is one of the best out there,btohqsg
Are u planning on doing pure?,btohqsg
