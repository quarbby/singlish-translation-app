I can study at home  in sch  outside library  even a noisy cafe...I'm rather flexible,btohqsg

The best public transport to study on is dt line train tbh,btohqsg

Ya so I won't write anything I'll just read my notes and then maybe memorise lorh,btohqsg
Esp when i see elite sch ppl,btohqsg

You can learn at your own pace,btohqsg
home based lectures are ok for me but tutorials hmmm,btohqsg
And go home early for self-revision,btohqsg
The best would be to start school at nine-ish and end tutorials around 1-2pm,btohqsg
3 days of school to be home based  2 days of tutorial @ school,btohqsg
OKAY this is a good idea,btohqsg
It's is damn ideal for me SOMEHOW HAHA,btohqsg
My school had that for 2 weeks,btohqsg
More HBL also means each student takes up less space in the school,btohqsg
Just in time for covid baby boom,btohqsg
