German cars build quality is definitely solid. Just that reliability and cost of upcoming are major concern for most.,btohqsg
Not sure why got such ‚Äújacky Loh‚Äù,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ueGoScRwCp8Here‚Äôs a good German. Driving over 300 is like cruising. Damn.,btohqsg
They are like Covid-19  evolved to become new variant and start to infect others. Our@SGCM_Adminis like our antibodies or vaccines.,btohqsg
It need more care and love,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it applies to all cars in Singapore? Car is so expensive here. Hee Hee,btohqsg
Actually I'm driving a Hyundai Elantra S. I prefer to let the Quiet Achiever speak for itself. Never brag or put down other owners who are singing praises about theirs. I have owned several brands of cars both continental  Japanese and now Korean in my 38 years of driving. My 2 cents worth is that Hyundai has both worlds combined into their models. Also not a petrol guzzler either. Have a Good Sunday All. üëç,btohqsg
How about the reliability of Hyundai or Kia? Looks like they have their fair shares of reliability issues and value for money,btohqsg
Well I guess No cars are without problems along the way. So in terms of reliability I have had not had any problems what's so ever till now. Touch wood. In fact it's such a joy and reasonably cheaper parts than Japanese and the more costly continental cars.,btohqsg
Is it cheaper than the Japs? I was told Korean parts quite ex,btohqsg
Sometimes the owner makes a difference as well. Some don‚Äôt maintain the car or rough handles it,btohqsg
Anyway Koreans have improved a lot,btohqsg
If its a mazda  even if its grossly mishandled  its fine.,btohqsg
I do have a question about hatchbacks  does anyone have any recommendations on how you can increase the safety aspects for the rear passenger area in the event that the car is rear ended.,btohqsg
Get sedan version lor. HB design already fixed shaped. How you want to cushion more perhaps put more foams in the boot. üòÇ,btohqsg
Prefer hatchbacks safety of rear passengers is the only drawback,btohqsg
On a serious note  if you are so concern with safety for rear passengers  perhaps don‚Äôt carry them,btohqsg
Use the rear space for cargo better,btohqsg
Same thing for those mpv having to occupy the last row for passengers.,btohqsg
Not at all. Depending on the part you change though.,btohqsg
I concur. In the eye of the beholder. Got 4-wheels can go anywhere is good enough.,btohqsg
When young  got 4-wheels can fetch babes. When grow older can fetch family. When grow old  can travel on 4-wheels is a blessing.,btohqsg
Aiya just enjoy when we get old we will be on the either manual two hand push or the 2hp motorized wheelchair,btohqsg
Agreed that Korean cars improved a lot but their prices also increase quite a fair bit,btohqsg
I'm glad there are other brands such as Mazda besides Toyota,btohqsg
Heard Hyundai AD is better. Don‚Äôt have so many conditions to get promo price.,btohqsg
They've improved leaps and bounds since Hyundai Pony era. That was their first model in SG if I remember back in the 80s,btohqsg
KIA cars are very identical to Hyundai in fact they almost share parts cause well they are from the same parent company.,btohqsg
Yes they are the same parent company. So are some of their parts. Besides the performance  they are getting more sleeker and sexier in their appearance and futuristic technologies as well. üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
I think the VW group is even worst than Peugeot‚Ä¶ talking about 7 to 10 years üöó,btohqsg
Yup.i totally agree. Not acclimatised for Singapore use  as most continental cars including the popular models here have chronic parts failure time and time again. Never ending.,btohqsg
cause got more parts and performance,btohqsg
Good morning sir. We have deleted and banned that user,btohqsg
At least i don‚Äôt see vw having more problems of small small things like console screen blackout  console screen freeze  door frame cracking due to misalignment.. to be specific.. renault,btohqsg
Any idea about Seat and Skoda?,btohqsg
Same‚Ä¶.their hatch locks always spoil‚Ä¶and little little things lah‚Ä¶. Ok not so little when it comes to repairing‚Ä¶ like buttons etc,btohqsg
Things that u never imagine will spoil in Japanese will spoil in the VW,btohqsg
My 308 had a spoilt power window motor‚Ä¶ and I understand that the Japanese ones seems to be interchangeable (like exchange the rear ones to the front) but the French are distinct so must repair,btohqsg
My Golf central lock spoil   hatch lock and hazard light button spoil‚Ä¶..the VRS (2010) also similar problems,btohqsg
As long as engine and transmission no problem is really ok lah‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I had the same problem with chevrolet. Got into trouble at Singapore customs last time when I arrived from JB. Customes officer thought i was trying to be funny. Finally managed to umlock after being pulled over and waited 30mins. So frustrated and then waited over 1 month for parts to arrive. Notced the boot loblck malfunction on hot and sunny weather when parked outdoors and not a problem indoors.,btohqsg
Oh yah at least the old golf  front headlights‚Äô wires casing seems to be melted by the heat so in the last couple of years may be dangerous‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Hahah ya lor‚Ä¶ it happens‚Ä¶.I mean it‚Äôs not a big thing but sianz lor,btohqsg
euro cars have these kinds of annoying problems.,btohqsg
they do not test things thoroughly,btohqsg
simple things like wheel studs design is just not as thoughtful as the japanese. euro cars tend to use wheel bolts  instead of wheel nuts like japanese do. i have endured years of wheel bolts on the bmws. terrible thing when mounting tires  often needing assistence. on the japanese design  tires can be easily mounted. all you need to do is to tighten the nuts.,btohqsg
this is better. easier to work on when mounting tires,btohqsg
this is typical euro style like bmw. hard to mount wheel without support,btohqsg
Err‚Ä¶ jap car change branded jap rims also need to use centrebore ring adapter leh..,btohqsg
Yes yes. We will take care because it‚Äôs that exp. ü§≠,btohqsg
