I heard that Toyota hybrid all very similar one  their latest hybrid engine is almost the same with different tweaks,btohqsg
Haha yeah ok la I mean it's an engineering thing,btohqsg
Once a design is proven and effective  basically it's just improvements on it for later models,btohqsg
The initial part where the R&D is involved is expensive and takes a while to do  and most companies/people are not willing to spend time  money and effort one lol,btohqsg
Yeah  if I am not wrong by 2040 is it all ICE car will get phrase out? At that point will be forced to either get hybrid or electric car already,btohqsg
For commuting purposes yes. For industrial work I doubt it la,btohqsg

Wanna ask about engine oil ah,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the ‚Äúgrade‚Äù of engine oil y‚Äôall having?5W -30 or 5W -40?,btohqsg
5W is the viscosity at low temp  40 is the viscosity at running temp,btohqsg
Newer cars tend to have lower viscosities since the engine parts tolerances are smaller  so need thinner oil to get in between the gaps to lubricate the engine,btohqsg
"Singapore weather usually 30 +-  so engine oil near this temp usually flows best  like x said also  new cars usually lower so that the oil can ""run"" to protect your engine the moment you start car",btohqsg
Y‚Äôall got like ‚Äúthis time 30  next time 40‚Äù? That sort of arrangement?,btohqsg
