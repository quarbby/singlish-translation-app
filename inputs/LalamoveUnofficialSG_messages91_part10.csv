Hi guys  thinking of joining lalamove using car. May I know around how much can u earn daily on average using car?,btohqsg
Depends on the fare and earn up $30,btohqsg
One day can do around how many ?,btohqsg
3 order lunch and 3 order at dinner,btohqsg
One day u can earn $120,btohqsg
Me too tbh  imma a student but now is the holiday.. i've been skeptical of joining llm bc i've never work this kind of job before. What if i send the orders late  then i heard in llm if didnt stack order it not worth it?,btohqsg
I think u guys shld just try out. Everyone earns different amount. Its just how much u want to do per day. Some drivers choose jobs  some drivers take any jobs. Some do whole day  some do few hours. How can we tell u on average how much u can earn a day? Also nowdays orders also not that much. And alot depends on whether u can bid n get the job. No harm just trying it out urself  if you find it not worth it then just stop and take back the deposit.,btohqsg
Good answer to those keep asking. Haha,btohqsg
All I can say is u have to try and error to get the momentum of your orders  cos fastest finger first to secure your orders.,btohqsg
That's y have to just go try  ask too much also no use 😂,btohqsg
$4 per drop nt worth leh,btohqsg
See how many u can do lo . But With car can stack more. Better use hybrid car.,btohqsg
Whao  for me once i reach $70-$80 order  i will stop,btohqsg
Keep telling me i not at the location for drop off,btohqsg
And yesterday i at Serangoon garden got a 4 order nearby all i didt get it dont know is it due to gps,btohqsg
Yah. Need to stack. Haiz. If only LLM ca,btohqsg
Not the LLM GPS got problem  it is the end user that got problem  anyhow PIN the GPS location,btohqsg
You didn't get it means  got drivers stationed even nearer to Serangoon garden than you.,btohqsg
Can be other reasons. Either nearer or higher rating or they have ang kong,btohqsg
wow  now Advance job can take more then 10. so good,btohqsg
AJ can stack more then 2.,btohqsg
ya this i know. try my best to stack. 😍,btohqsg
My skills not good in stacking  still learning.,btohqsg
Here's my guidance for youI took a big risk yesterday  I am reaping the benefits from it today. All it takes is something that you would not even think of.Want to know more? Let me report spam first.,btohqsg
Even I try to stack or without stacking   earnings per hour still $20/hour hai..,btohqsg
After you do too fast always end up no jobs,btohqsg
Grab car food still can 27$ per hr,btohqsg
I think I need to close my GrabCar account the. Can open GrabCar account,btohqsg
Cos I don’t have phvl anymore,btohqsg
If don’t have phvl don’t know they still gives $27 or not not sure can register bo,btohqsg
No needJust registered grab foodGo discover find,btohqsg
Need to be PDvl then can reg grabfood,btohqsg
I also heard end of September LTA want to take away grabfood service from driver,btohqsg
Hi everyone! New to LLM here. Need some tips and advice from any one of you using cars. I understand that car parking sometimes is very hard. I took an order once from Little India on a Sunday and merchant told me to just park by the road side and collect the food. I felt too paisey to park coz it was a busy street and there wasnt any space in front of the shop to squeeze a car in. It was literally the pavement and then the road. Had to do multiple turns to find a spot. In such a case  how would you go about parking your car?,btohqsg
Like this die die must rent van Liao,btohqsg
Normally yr food will be ready most of the time just park and collect without delay  for shopping mall I wouldn’t even want to accept cos very risky . Honestly little Indra is much more easier then some shopping mall,btohqsg
"Yeah. that particular shop  food was ready for collection. but I guess I was too paisey to do that since I once used to think ""Why lah these drivers cause convenience and park here""",btohqsg
I never took any malls and especially CBD area orders before. the hassle of finding parking and all.,btohqsg
Most of the time is illegal parking for me but if you collect fast shouldn’t be a problem,btohqsg
I see. So I just have to be thick skin for that 2mins and quickly grab food and chao. Thank you :),btohqsg
Does LLM also keep track on our timing? Coz I remember theres a grace period or smth like that once we take an order right? I dont remember the training.,btohqsg
Of cos try not to park in the middle of the road 😆 that Wan your have to train your skin to super thick lol… just find a place nearby not blocking others can already,btohqsg
1 order 30mins for PU and 30mins for DO,btohqsg
YES they do especially when you’re doing stack they know and they will send msg for you to appeal if you’re late,btohqsg
A lot of things training never tell you,btohqsg
After you did something wrong and they don’t like when they start to question you,btohqsg
I bet training never tell you if you reach customer place and they want to cancel booking you will get half of the amount stated in your job card,btohqsg
