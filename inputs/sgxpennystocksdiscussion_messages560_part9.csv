CLSA downgrade. We turn more cautious on Raffles Medical (RFMD) following a policy change regarding PCR testing for passengers arriving to Changi Airport. From 27 Oct  passengers from a number of countries (Category 2 to 4) will no longer need to undergo PCR tests upon arrival. Although the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) still requires PCR tests and could drive 2022 earnings  its share is unlikely to enjoy a further rerating  in our view. Risk of further policy changes regarding PCR tests/prices  coupled with its earnings reliance on PCR tests could weigh on the stock. We cut our2022-2023estimates by 4%-8%  downgrade our recommendation from BUY to Underperform and lower our target price from S$1.87 to S$1.60 based on a c.18x 22CL EV/Ebitd,btohqsg

There seems to be steady accumulation in OKH. 4 reasons that we may see a strong run here:1. Neurology play - property micro cap like The Place and Sinjia have gone up multiple times and those BBs who make money there may rotate their profits to OKH which only has a tiny market cap at $24m.2. OKH managed to turn into profit of $3.8m for FY2021 (End Jun) after 2 years of loss. Mgt also guided that it's looking into new biz.3. Gordan Tang took a major stake at 10c and his wife  Celine is now the non-executive chairman. I'm sure the Tang couple will find ways to beef up FA of OKH so that price can be above of their purchase price in due time.4. Slow but steady accumulation seem going on from the TAShall we expect a run if Sinjia Land clear 10c??,btohqsg
