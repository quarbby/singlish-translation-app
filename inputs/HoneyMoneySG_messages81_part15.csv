Long time ago. Citi maxi saver or what had such stupid mechanics too. I hated it,btohqsg
if i top up my cpf now is still count toward 2023 or 2024 tax relief ?,btohqsg
What year are u in now?,btohqsg
ah i thought still got chance :o,btohqsg
Lol.. can top-up now also for 2024,btohqsg
Is either too early and too late lol,btohqsg
take note if you're paying via paypal it'll be 4121 - transport cat,btohqsg
so i transferred out 100k at 10pm on 31 dec 2023  dunno if can still be eligible for the UOB rising dragon if i deposit 100k on 2 Jan 2024,btohqsg
Nope. You have to minimally have 120k for the $88 tier. Your transfer on 31 Dec is only processed on 2 Jan,btohqsg
If you transferred on 30 Dec 10pm still ok,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG..  Strange.. seems like CPF MA interest went into MA? Looks like unable to topup 3K into MA.,btohqsg
Same here! Was gonna ask this too,btohqsg
Ya..the yearly interest has automatically gone into the BHS...only can top up a couple of hundred vs the whole 3k..sian liao..,btohqsg
Anyone use xnap here? Whats the best credit card to use? Not sure if citibank rewards card award point for this kind of mobile transaction,btohqsg
If your bhs is 68.5k and received int  wait a while  the interest will either flow to OA or SA. When it is back to 68.5k  you can top up the 3k to reach the new BhS.,btohqsg
Just realized the same this morning. Sad,btohqsg
Amaze link to citi reward card,btohqsg
Why would it flow to OA and SA??,btohqsg
MA interest is transferred out to either:1. SA (if SA < FRS)2. OA (if SA >= FRS),btohqsg
"Bec ur MA cannot be more than the stipulated BHS. So in 2023 the BhS is 68.5k. anything more  will need to ""splurge out"" to either OA or SA",btohqsg
Watch from 05:20 i explained  every year this question will pop out one. Just wait awhilehttps://youtu.be/cSC7CXZwHwc?si=-heTBTwQi98G8azw,btohqsg
Didn't pay attention in class (as usual üôà,btohqsg
xxxx new clicks on Chris' video üòÑ,btohqsg
But every month still need to increase the balance,btohqsg
I withdraw my uob one account cash last night. Would anyone be able to advise if it is still counted please? I would still try it out nevertheless.,btohqsg
Stash is maintain or increase leh. So no withdraw plus interest every month should work,btohqsg
Hihi  newbie here on UOB earmarked promo.If my UOB One has a balance of 1k on 29 Dec 2023  I register to participate in theRising Dragon Savings Promotion& deposit 100k on 2 Jan. Is it that I will get the $588?,btohqsg
Nope  withdraw on 31dec is process on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Oh I see too bad. Thank you Queenie.,btohqsg
Yes provide u maintain the 100k till the amt is earmark on 29 feb after u register for the promo,btohqsg
Hi. I am not able to top up 3k to Medisave  as interest got credited in my MA account. Earlier in 2023  my MA was already reached to 68.5k and I wanted to top up 3k today.,btohqsg
So even if exceed 100k  just keep inside?,btohqsg
Pardon me for asking. 30 Dec is Saturday  would it still be processed if it is at 10pm please?,btohqsg
If it was me i would just keep inside from jan to may loh so it dont lose the bonus interest due to withdrawal that cause mab to fall,btohqsg
U can check your acct transaction to be sure,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I will go open stash account first üòÅ,btohqsg
U can always open on 30 jan then pump in the money required for earmark on 1 feb to maximize the return,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie for the enlightening comment. Haha too bad for me,btohqsg
I believe need to wait for the interest in MA to be transferred to SA. usually CPF does it on 1 Jan so probably it will be reflected tmr,btohqsg
I did rstu 8k 1 week ago. But the money is still showing ‚Äòreserved amounts‚ÄôWhen will it go into my sa/ra?,btohqsg
Anyone still keep the TnC for the previous (around Oct 2023) WeBull's moneybull US$120 / US$$1500 promo?                                                Is it from today (1 Jan) onwards can safely withdraw/redeem out the Fullerton Cash fund ?  I remember them saying on 5 Jan 2024 will receive the bonus USD 120 or USD 1500 or USD 3000.,btohqsg
Thank you. I checked transaction history for previous  year. 31st Dec 2022  interest was credited about 2.6k and on 1st Jan they moved partially 2.2k to other accounts.,btohqsg
How does the rotation between 2 accounts work? I have 100k earmarked in UOB Stash till 15 Jan 2024. If balance in UOB One is 0  does it mean I can join the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion by transferring the 100k from Stash to One account after 15 Jan? Or it has to be fresh funds from other bank?,btohqsg
My earmarked funds from UOB one account will only be back in mid March. So actually still have to wait,btohqsg
Finally the uob one cny promo only ask 20k. Haiz wasted,btohqsg
Fresh fund from other bank. But u can always transfer out from stash and transfer in from other bank under family name that u trust,btohqsg
Good morning all. Time to top up CPF. But CPF website high traffic üòÇ,btohqsg
Rotation only work well for people with 200k. As uob one base plus bonus is 5 percent  better then stash which is 3 plus ard 1.7 with earmark,btohqsg
I see. So I can transfer the 100k from UOB Stash to my other bank account  then transfer back into UOB One. Even if my Stash drops by 100k  it will not affect my UOB One joining the promotion since it is not a direct transfer of fund from Stash to One  is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Yes by left  by right is cant but if u use a third party name to transfer in is consider fresh fund,btohqsg
