Depositors pull nearly $60bn from three US banks as Apple raises pressure:Source1. Big US financial groups Charles Schwab  State Street and M&T suffered almost $60bn in combined bank deposit outflows in the first quarter as customers continued to move their money in search of higher returns.2. The deposit flight has been turbocharged by the collapse last month of Silicon Valley Bank and two other US lenders  with cash moving out of bank accounts at a pace not seen since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.3. US savers have been yanking cash out of low-yielding bank accounts and ploughing it into alternative products such as money market funds or Treasury bills that pay better returns  allowing them to take advantage of the sharp interest rate rises implemented by the Federal Reserve. The average US bank account savings rate is just 0.37 per cent  according to government data  versus the Fed’s benchmark rate of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent.More here,btohqsg
