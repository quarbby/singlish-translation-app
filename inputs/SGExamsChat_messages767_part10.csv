u should make a sticker pack,btohqsg
till i pass the test first,btohqsg
lol I had this feeling that in ac the boys teams are generally better than girls teams,btohqsg
Like whenever got the sports results announced I see the boys teams for most CCAs getting a higher position,btohqsg
acjc girls squash team also quite mediocre,btohqsg
it's like telling a bodybuilder to arm wrestle with a scrawny girl,btohqsg
curious  wld yall guys try to do more competitions n stuff or focus on WAs  at sec 4,btohqsg
Normally people that focus more on competitions fall into two cats. The ones that know they can't improve much anymore or the ones that are not booksmart.The first thing Poly Jc and even Ite look at is your results not your participations in competitions,btohqsg
see your capacity. if you've got a handle on your regular acads stuff then sure. if not your ability to focus on both simultaneously must be there lol,btohqsg
i mean pretty much all of the competition cover o lvl syllabus so i see why not that kind,btohqsg
i want that experience to compare outside of my sch environment,btohqsg
but it's not limited to o level?,btohqsg
Sorry man I was spring cleaning the house,btohqsg

So seems like there won't be a huge change,btohqsg
Cca only really used in tiebreakers,btohqsg
The good news is I can abandon my jackets and all,btohqsg
ideally i get at least above participation for the 2 junior olympiads,btohqsg
And finally the weather is getting warmer since it is like 10 degrees last week,btohqsg
The other ite telegram group that calista told the owner whom created off for creating one,btohqsg
The bad news? Well summer is coming,btohqsg
Like what did the Santa guy say,btohqsg
like those Harvard dudes with a 3.5,btohqsg
Aka I am not looking forward to go to the office,btohqsg
How long have you been living in Japan?,btohqsg
Because apparently my office aircon not cold enough,btohqsg
im not completely throwing my others,btohqsg
Actually I'm turning my fan on now so...,btohqsg

He just casually mentioned he goes jc in the ite channel of the grp,btohqsg
It was too cold this March,btohqsg

The temperature in Japan rise and fall pretty fast,btohqsg
One week it is super cold,btohqsg
One week later it is like 20 degrees,btohqsg
Then next week becomes 10 degrees again,btohqsg
Do you find it hard to adapt to the culture and lifestyle there,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve been binging lots of Japan videos,btohqsg
I think that's why I'm getting migraines,btohqsg
Lifestyle some of it can be very frustrating,btohqsg
Do you feel like some locals can be xenophobic,btohqsg
Or most of them are very nice,btohqsg
My friend had to buy a singlet,btohqsg
Cuz she didn't pack enough warm weather clothes,btohqsg
Actually quite a lot of the locals are more of the polite nice,btohqsg
So they seem nice because they sound polite,btohqsg
Xenophobic? I only encountered like a super small handful of them,btohqsg
