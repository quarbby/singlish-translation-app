so somerimes i ask my mum to do it for me,btohqsg
The doctor squeeze the pus out and my ear was full of blood,btohqsg
But the good thing is that I feel that my quality of life improves because of that,btohqsg
Oh I went to Google and search for a earwax removal clinic,btohqsg
I Google search in the morning,btohqsg
Then they tell me to go for appointment in the afternoon,btohqsg
Nah I dont want to go polyclinic because I am very scared of them referring me to some other clinics,btohqsg
In sg if u call as emergency  u go down probably need wait at least 30min,btohqsg
Because I am flying off to Japan two days later,btohqsg
I know very well that mine is not an emergency,btohqsg
Well in the end they really have an appointment,btohqsg
Apparently the doctor is very good,btohqsg
I see the place and it feels like some atas rich people will go if they want to see a doctor,btohqsg
Either way its an one off thing,btohqsg
In singapore they will anyhow assign if u dun pay private rate,btohqsg
So my dad keep telling me ‘moral of the story is need to work hard and earn money’,btohqsg
And thus this is why I go to a private clinic,btohqsg
Funnily enough I still remember how the healthcare system in SG works,btohqsg
And I know that yes I shouldn't go to a polyclinic,btohqsg
Even in a real emergency  u can spend 2h waiting at AnE,btohqsg
Tbh idk what is the real problem but Govt hosp seem to forever run out of bed,btohqsg
So another moral of the story is stay healthy yourself,btohqsg
Also get insurance before it is too late,btohqsg
If no insurance  even u rich i think also cant bear to spend so much on the hospital and treatment bills,btohqsg
That's why just be your own doctor,btohqsg
Yea and dun take for granted early years,btohqsg
Maybe planning to buy another one as well,btohqsg
Funnily enough this is what I do sometimes,btohqsg
If the illness is not that bad,btohqsg
I dun usually visit the doctor coz i stock up medicines at home,btohqsg
If very bad till the point that I need a specialist  then I will see a specialist,btohqsg
I just stockpile medications for most common ailments,btohqsg
Ngl this is what I do,btohqsg
Oni thing I need a doctor for really is antibiotics,btohqsg
Funnily enough my temperature always spikes when i visit the clinic,btohqsg
So I know what medicine is for what,btohqsg
There was once i visited the clinic coz i needed an MC…reached the clinic and i felt my body heating up,btohqsg
U can solve the problem by going jb,btohqsg
Nothing that some ibuprofen won't solve,btohqsg
Btw does eae projects have deadline?,btohqsg
The clinic gave me 2 panadol tablets,btohqsg
wah where u want to eae,btohqsg
I immune to those alr tbh also I find em weak,btohqsg
And wanted to send me to ttsh AnE and when my dad came  he scolded the nurse and say he wanted to speak to the doctor,btohqsg
Sadly speaking there's no concept of sick leave in Japan,btohqsg
He still working on arduino stuff,btohqsg
To my understanding is if u rlly sick u go hospital,btohqsg
He say can bring his projects with him for interview,btohqsg
Im immune to it for headache  but fever it still does help but some generic brands of paracetamol are useless,btohqsg
I kenna covid that time also have no paid leave,btohqsg
