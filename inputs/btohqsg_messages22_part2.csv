Priority scheme is for those with child or elderly?,btohqsg
hi all  need some advice here.anybody know about the 2 room flats for elderly. can just call hdb or check if there are available ones within a specific area?,btohqsg
Sms indicate Step 3 View Application Details.  Only see this,btohqsg
ok thanks! maybe i will check on the open booking. i saw the open booking but it seems hardly open for booking :/,btohqsg
obf is leftover from sbf  so u have to wait for ppl to finish selecting for sbf first then obf will openobf is not a 24/7 thing,btohqsg
Just wondering  for shortlease 2Rm  if the flat is returned to HDB for whatever reason (eg death) after being lived in for a few years  which category will such flats be classified under? Repossessed flats? And how will they be offered to the public again  SBF or OBF ?,btohqsg
Got a curious qn.If person A has an out of supply queue no. for oct 2023 but a within supply queue no for dec 2023  gets called up for Oct 2023  is he/she able to reject the Oct 2023?,btohqsg
Will it be considered a rejection and affect dec 2023 queue no.?,btohqsg
Is there still obf these days? Sbf also hard to get. Oversubscribed,btohqsg
Sbf limited supply thats why oversubscribe more compare to bto,btohqsg
You rejectYour second Q number will be cancel and become second timer for a yearOr you put it cold down period for a. Year can't select any BTO SBFOnly resale,btohqsg
Only when HDB inform you no need to come due to some reason then you are saved,btohqsg
I mean ive been trying to apply sbf since 2022 but never get. Obf also never get notificition of launch these days. Maybe its a thing prior 2022,btohqsg
Yeah. Sbf use to be 2 times a year. Then they screw up last year. No sbf in nov 2023. Damn,btohqsg
You can reject Oct 2023 bto only if total number of units left is 10 <When is your turn,btohqsg
Please go to correct group .,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone can advise if my projected key collect for Brickland Weave is Dec 2027 till June 2029.* If i am called upon by HDB to collect key in Mar 2028  how long may i delay collection my hse key?* Can i ask to delay key till June 2029?,btohqsg
Hmm should be possible to delay. I think you can write into HDB to ask,btohqsg
Weird uh. Usually by now OBF details shld come out alr.,btohqsg
Last year second OBF totally never came around.,btohqsg
I suspected all units booked during SBF so no leftover for OBF,btohqsg
📕PDF brochures of SOME FEB 2024 BTO projects are now accessible!Find floor plans here  as well as OCS details.»Bedok North Springs (Bedok)» Bedok South Bloom (Bedok)»Matilda Riverside (Punggol)»Rail Garden @ CCK (Choa Chu Kang)» Tanglin Halt Courtyard (Queenstown)»Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang (Hougang)»Woodgrove Edge (Woodlands)HDB has not uploaded the PDF brochures of the 'unclickable' projects. This post will be updated accordingly when they are made available. Do check back.__In case you were wondering...1. The link(s) to your respective project brochure(s) is/are accessible via the HDB portal when you receive your appointment officially. This was how a past applicant managed to derive the URLs of all other brochures  as we can engineer them as long as we have the project names (that is  unless HDB decides to change the URL formats... again).2. Up until Feb 2023  there was a common page for all BTO brochures for that exercise  but this has been discontinued since May 2023.__⚠️ This announcement message will be deleted and combined with themain Feb 2024 BTO postof this channel in 3 days.#feb2024,btohqsg
FYI  some appointment brochures for Feb 2024 are out!,btohqsg

hi! does anyone know if jurong dec 2023 bto 2-room started flat selection already?,btohqsg
Jurong Arcadia hasn't started selectionCan join the grp chat@jurongwestdecbto2023,btohqsg
Actually none of the Dec 2023 projects have started selection per SM's info :)https://t.me/btoapptdates/165,btohqsg
have! chai chee green (bedok) has  albeit community care apartments only -tracker here. with this  the theory expoundedhereis correct  i.e. that only one dec 2023 project started selection in march itself.,btohqsg
for everyone's info  seehttps://t.me/btoapptdates/3for a bird's eye view of the selection statuses of all BTO projects since aug 2020,btohqsg
Apologies  do see SMs message herehttps://t.me/btohqsg/78586,btohqsg
I'm actually quite worried about my upcoming house 😅 Worried HDB dont want to borrow that much because me and my wife combined income only $5000. Key collection is in June  HDB didn't advice me on what to do next,btohqsg
Only discuss about BTO relate thanks here. No others ads or post,btohqsg
Hello is this Tengah resident community chat?,btohqsg
Which tengah project are you looking for?,btohqsg
I like to know if anyone has spare wall tiles which they don’t want can give to me?,btohqsg
The residents had gotten the keys already,btohqsg
Want to know hdb loan eligibility is based on salary when signed lease or key collection. Its could be 5years apart and applicants salary can be folds up since signed lease.,btohqsg
As long as you can settle the unit price in full on the appointment before key collection  you’re good to go.,btohqsg
During HFE application will tell you how much HDB loanOn first appointment will tell you about how much is your loan and everything ( more or less confirm)3 months before key collection just to see if you can repay the loan than HDB will processElse HDB loan maybe cancel you have to come out with cashIf not cash you can't collect key,btohqsg
No increase of load at key collection,btohqsg
HFE is not existing in 2021 when the time i signed lease.,btohqsg
3 months before key collection got another check? Are u sure? Is it based on ur self experience?,btohqsg
What happen to your downpayment that u had paid?,btohqsg
Can only answer base on what I knowFor official answer best look for HDB,btohqsg
Thanks  i think better ask hdb too.,btohqsg
Some say they will reassess is still case by case  End of the day just choose the unit within your means dont over commit unless u got extra spare cash in place,btohqsg
My concern now is i may over qualified for hdb loan,btohqsg
