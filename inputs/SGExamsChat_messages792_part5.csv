Idk when will my next sq flight be sia,btohqsg
Bro mine exchange it ain't cheap to buy 4 months of travel insurance,btohqsg
My last sq flight was in 2021 / 2022 i think,btohqsg
Lol imagine gg somewhere near just to get a cheap sq flight,btohqsg
esp if it's a shitty plane,btohqsg
It's like flying to Bangkok DMK cuz the tickets are cheap,btohqsg
pray to dear god you don't get the plane that killed a few hundred ppl,btohqsg
Oh yea near areas usually is the small planes,btohqsg
or the plane that got grandfathered in from silkair,btohqsg
My friend got a free teddy bear fr sq stewardess,btohqsg
The classic A320 for the short flights,btohqsg
And idk he more crazy then me la  go take a pic w the stewardess,btohqsg
not necessasrily sia KL gets A350s,btohqsg
I tot i was crazy enough to be their fan,btohqsg
u see penang get like 738,btohqsg
But i shy ask them for a photo,btohqsg
I will never fly scoot ever again,btohqsg
I took scoot just coz my dad ask me to pay myself if i want to take sq,btohqsg
As long as it's dirt cheap idc tbh scoot is like the Ryanair of Asia,btohqsg
The plane took off despite it being faulty,btohqsg
Never even provide details of the fault,btohqsg
Actually I prefer boeing ones cuz the flyby wire is better than the Airbus system for control,btohqsg
One moment said the plane delay coz there is a fault,btohqsg
ya but u don't even get IFE or wifi,btohqsg
do yall know any printing shops in singapore that can print posters,btohqsg
How does a freaking plane fault get sorted in 5min,btohqsg
Just unplug and sleep on flights,btohqsg
So mid flight my ear suddenly hurts + i cant hear anything,btohqsg
It lasted for a few hours actually,btohqsg
like just a square poster to put in your room,btohqsg
i cant remember the material name,btohqsg
Anyway in my opinion nth can beat sq,btohqsg
My worst experience was with airasia,btohqsg
I dun even dare to step my foot into 1,btohqsg
Budget airline is not worth it,btohqsg
Plane plummeted suddenly and my buttocks lifted from the seat,btohqsg
Nd i heard japan gonna hv another budget airline just started operation,btohqsg
The vomit bag suddenly became a hot commodity,btohqsg
Imagine u went to the toilet,btohqsg
most of the flight is on autopilot,btohqsg
ya fly up to like 2 500ft,btohqsg
there's always one pilot keeping a watch but they don't actively steer,btohqsg
I actually miss flying Singapore airlines,btohqsg
But my parents said it is too expensive,btohqsg
But i cant imagine sq to europe is cheaper than a flight to japan,btohqsg
every time i go longer distance i fly SQ or Emirates,btohqsg
I told myself I will not step my foot into a budget airline again,btohqsg
But now a lot is going on in the middle east,btohqsg
i meant in general like even from last time,btohqsg
anyway when i get on a plane  if it goes down  i just accept my fate,btohqsg
