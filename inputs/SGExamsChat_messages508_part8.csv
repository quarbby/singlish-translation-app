whoever is the main admin of this chat,btohqsg
nah. is not abt extremely affordable. it shouldn't rip off ppl in the first place,btohqsg
pls rename this chat to SGExams GP chat grp,btohqsg
there should be controlled quota not thru coe,btohqsg
govt linked renters have been buying a lot of new vehicles,btohqsg
so u tell me if this is not rigged?,btohqsg
if its extremely costly in the first place  lesser people wld be able to afford let alone think of buying one  so less people buy cars and hence less cars on the road,btohqsg
OMF my eczema coming back holy shit fuck the heat,btohqsg
brother if you do a controlled quota on no. of cars in SG i can tell you they will become worse,btohqsg
no eh the stadium got on abit of aircon,btohqsg
but coe & all the useless taxes doesn't help. still gt jams & all,btohqsg
ya bro felt damn cool inside,btohqsg
controlled quota will just make prices for them to skyrocket  making affordability worse,btohqsg
controlled quota as in penalize those who wna keep cars more than 10 yrs,btohqsg
the price oso not an issue,btohqsg
the cars will be comparatively new,btohqsg
the point of COE is not for Govt to make more money,btohqsg
tbh sg shld rethink the way of doing public transport. make public transport faster than driving,btohqsg
but COE is literaily there to limit the no. of cars so more people take public transport rather than cars,btohqsg
u see how many will drive alr,btohqsg
for TEL they tried to drive the trains at 90km/h  just only 10km/h above the usual maximum trains run at  80km/h ,btohqsg
but just that small increase in speeds caused many people to report extremely loud noise at speed  some reports even going as loud as 100dB,btohqsg
is they are not willing to invest,btohqsg
travelling to and fro work  and you're slowly losing your hearing,btohqsg
eh. oso depend on the kind of train u use,btohqsg
no need to rch that lvl,btohqsg
because of that i think they alr reduced the speed to 80km/h,btohqsg
ah you think SG trains got no timetable ah?,btohqsg
the train they buy oso that kind of quality,btohqsg
u pay what u get ig,btohqsg
u use literaily any other train,btohqsg
is whether you 're willing to invest in it or not,btohqsg
wah u say that to sg train enthus i tell you they gonna laugh right in your face,btohqsg
like that those 130km/h ones will be noisy af,btohqsg
cuz even 90km/h ppl alr complain v noisy?,btohqsg
SG trains actually do have a timetable they follow  like this train service arrive at this station at this time,btohqsg
no offense but sg trains sucks,btohqsg
sg shld look on ways to improve and evolve it,btohqsg
now the standard is like stagnated,btohqsg
I had trainspotted for more than a year and I've seen the exact same train service arrive at the exact same time at that particular station,btohqsg
the timing on the RATIS display where u see all the ads and train timings use the distance of train from station not how long its gonna take  with temporary speed restrictions on the tracks definitely will take v long even tho timing say like 3min only,btohqsg
have u rode on oversea ones? those faster ones have no issues with noise isolation,btohqsg
only sg have so much issues,btohqsg
you say that but in many ways we are literaily world class in terms of rail transport,btohqsg
you go anywhere in SG there is no train that is driver operated,btohqsg
all trains in SG are operated Automatically,btohqsg
how come can't be banned permanently,btohqsg
u wanna know whats the diff?,btohqsg
overseas got plenty of land-can choose the best possible places to build rail,btohqsg
thats why ever since the north south and east west line no other line is over ground,btohqsg
