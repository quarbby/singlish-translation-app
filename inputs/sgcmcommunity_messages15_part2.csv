I am offered car insurance policies from both DirectAsia and Etiqa at NCD30. Eqtiqa is about $100 more expensive than DirectAsia  so I’m wondering if anyone could advise which I should go for. Thanks!,btohqsg
if both coverage same   i will pick the cheaper.,btohqsg
or if the cheaper one covers my needs.. i will still pick the cheaper.,btohqsg
Coverage more or less the same. Normally i just take the lowest quote by agent,btohqsg

Directasia quoted me 910 vs income 802,btohqsg
DA usually don't cover personal accident  medical expenses  24/7 road assistance  authorised driver and overseas emergency unless u opt in.check if DA quote is opt in those above and on par with TIQ.if so  take DA.,btohqsg
Or u wish give SGDriver Pte Ltd a try. They give me very good quote but too bad they revert abit slow so i renew with regular agent.,btohqsg
moneysmart or singsaver also can.otherwise  diy research... i have compared like 15 companies myself so my memory is still fresh. 😅,btohqsg

That's very expensive for a very underwhelming ev... 😟,btohqsg
all british things are expensive and underwhelming,btohqsg
These cheaper insurance generally no agent to help you if need to claim. If you can find one with agent then it's ok,btohqsg
British pedigree  German technology. This two add up  doesn’t sound cheap.,btohqsg

So no longer need vax record to proof alr?,btohqsg
no reason why they will ask cause they not only remove the app  the restriction to go places for unvax also removed.,btohqsg
sg removed tracetogether but if im not wrong.. by right stll need vax status to go restaurants blah blah,btohqsg
lol summon and demerit points.Only drivers with clean records can participate in contests/promo/giveaways,btohqsg
Ok so it’s much more easier alr.,btohqsg
Still have restaurants ask to show vax status,btohqsg
Just TNG + Passport ans We are good.,btohqsg
Can show our TT or MySehjetara?,btohqsg
Just in case just do la,btohqsg
Thanks. Now I just need to slowly wait for my PP approval....🥲,btohqsg
Later they demand kopi money or something... no need to give them any excuse to create trouble,btohqsg
Ya I think I’ll get to it during this weekend.,btohqsg
Msia is the one which might demand kopi money lol,btohqsg
Previously  unvaccinated individuals could not dine out or enter shopping malls  but from May 1  they will be allowed to do so.Premises will no longer require the public to check in using the MySejahtera app  which is an app similar to Singapore’s TraceTogether  and its use will be optional.- Vaccination status not required. Mysejahtera is optional for them.. i didnt see any during hari raya weekend but yeah they CAN ask for app if they wan to. nobody will lah haha -,btohqsg
Ya but not sure if we can use TT in Malaysia?,btohqsg
