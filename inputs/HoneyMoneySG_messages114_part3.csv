Getting scammed by SCB ðŸ˜¡ ask them return you your 1 point ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

Hi for this month 30Jun is on a sunday. If i were to empty the hsbc ega account for next promotion  i will to do so by 29Jun? Anything i transfer out on 30Jun will only register it as on 01Jul ?,btohqsg

Late to the party. Wanna ask about my Citi rewards card already added to the amaze card   and the amaze card is added to my Google wallet . If I use Google pay (amaze card ) to tap for transaction. Do I get the 10x points ? Or I must use the physical amaze card in order to get 10x points ?,btohqsg
either method is fine  as long as not blacklisted mcc e.g. hotels,btohqsg
How about shopback pay ? Also can get 10x points?,btohqsg
For the moomoo 6.8%. The count down to return is 3 days time. For the withdrawal to bank is it immediate or is it advisable to do it earlier?,btohqsg
If it's not blacklisted in t&c  then yes. If it is then no.,btohqsg
Cause tot will be like snack and will take few days to sell away the fund n receive the amount to bank,btohqsg
Means empty out before end of jun  put back on 1st jul   i will b eligible for both jun and jul incremental $ bonus interest?,btohqsg
No. Why put back in Jul?,btohqsg
But have you even receive the payout?,btohqsg
Ega promo is for jun-jul. jul needs incremental balance for bonus interest?,btohqsg
EGA is based on May for Jun-Jul cycle unless you are talking bout everyday rewards always compared to previous month,btohqsg
Everyday+ Rewards in Jul will reference Jun. You'll not get that 1%.,btohqsg
Hey experts I have an weird question to askI went polyclinic for dental and paid their using  uob one cc which I believe shoukd be excluded I their tnc....But somehow the interest tracker  increased (which means included in the 500 min spend for uob Savings account)Can I take it as since INtERst tracker moved its count towards uob one credit card spending as well?,btohqsg
UOB One CC exclusion and UOB One account exclusion are 2 different lists.,btohqsg
This one anyone use before? 5 Buy trades of stocks/etf what is the minimum price of stock?,btohqsg
I paid there physically not via healthhub (stupid mistake)I checked heymax polyclinic(I check jurong polyclinic on heymax but I didn't go that one) is mcc  8062 which should be excluded by uob Savings and cardWhich made me confuse so I asked,btohqsg
So based on the app  the transaction is already posted?,btohqsg
Are you sure the tracker has increased based on that transaction and not other transactions that have been posted?,btohqsg
100% positive becusse I was confuse and went to calculate myself hahah,btohqsg
Well maybe the tracker for UOB One account could still be valid but the card is risky. It determines whether you meet the tier or not. No harm to spend the amount again to cover.,btohqsg
What I can only think of is that maybe that polyclinic is not coded as hospital mcc,btohqsg
Thanks for the  advise (uob one bonus  account paid out already)But couple of days  left for rhe uob card one,btohqsg
Last month's transaction? You ask now also a bit late.,btohqsg
And just because it counts as interest tracker doesnâ€™t mean it counts for uob credit card,btohqsg
It got posted on 31st so it's calculated towards last month on uob accountOne card dates are out of sync with the accountmy one  card is not up so double confirming it,btohqsg
There is a digital counter. I paid there,btohqsg
Maybe the digital kiosk different MCC ðŸ¤” like healthhub?,btohqsg
Likely it is a Healthub version in kiosk setup.,btohqsg
to conserve your amaze 1k cap you can just use crmc directly on shopback pay,btohqsg
Hello  I have fresh funds of 140k to park  Right now im considering HSBC EGA  I read that some banks allow self crediting of salary as part of the Salary requirement? Could anyone recommend or share details on the verified banks that allows for self-crediting? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Sounds about a correct guessNext time would just use healthhub app to pay for 100% ease of mind.Thanks guys for the help,btohqsg
HSBC EGA do not have salary crediting criteria.,btohqsg
Yup but the bonus interest isn't as high as other banks with Salary Crediting requirement thus im wondering if I could make use of those bank and self credit salary if that works.,btohqsg
4.65% p.a. in Jun is pretty much the highest.,btohqsg
Just with salary crediting your interest wonâ€™t be high as well. Thereâ€™s other criteriaâ€™s to fulfill. All the main banks allow self credit of salary,btohqsg
Iâ€™m a new DBS card holder and thinking of opening a bank account too. Would anyone know how the best order for the posb cashback bonus and the DBS multiplier account promo? Iâ€™m a bit confused by it being a new DBS credit card customer,btohqsg
