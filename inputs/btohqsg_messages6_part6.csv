Hi All  what are your chances of getting a sbf for FT with priority?,btohqsg
as long as don't get married üòâ,btohqsg
you have applied for priority under the Parenthood Priority Scheme(PPS) and the Married Child Priority Scheme(MCPS). Your flat application will be balloted with the other PPS applications for 50% of the flat supply set aside for this scheme. If the application is not successful under the PPS  it will be balloted a second time with the other MCPS applicants for the 30% of the flat supply set aside for this scheme. If the application is also not successful under the MCPS  it will be balloted a third time in the first-timer group under the Public Scheme.,btohqsg
Example:UNITSBTO distribution for non-elderly in mature estatesFlat type: 2-room Flexi to 5-roomAssume there are 100 units available.First timers: 95% of the flats are set aside. This case 95 units.Within the 95%  the break down is:Families (PPS) = 30% (30 units)Families (MCPS) = 30% (30 units)Other families = 35% (35 units) (total add up to 95%)Second timers: 5% (This case only 5 units for you.)APPLICANTSAssuming total 400 families applied.300 are first timers  100 second timers.out of the first timers there arePPS family: 90MCPS family : 90 (and 30 PPS families also applied for MCPS  yes you can apply more than one scheme)just first timer family: 120TOTAL 300 first timers families,btohqsg
Second timer family: 100There are pps and mcps too  but to simplify I just ignore it  assume no one applied priority scheme.BALLOTFirst  hdb will ballot for top 100%  in this case is 100 units.HDB will first shortlist 100 families  then assign random number to these 100 families.FIRST TIMER DRAW95 units for first timerPPS DRAWS FIRST30 units for PPS: 90 families will lucky draw for the 30 chance. (take note  each family has 2 lucky draw ticket  but if you have failed twice  you will have extra tickets)Total 90 families ballot for 30 units.MCPS DRAWS SECOND30 units for MCPS: 90 families + the 30 PPS and MCPS families who failed ballot (To simplify  I just assume they unlucky and all 30 are unsuccessful in PPS draw).,btohqsg
ALL OTHER FIRST TIMER DRAWS35 units for Other families: 120 first timer families + 120 unsuccessful PPS & MCPS familiesTotal 240 families ballot for 35 units.End of first timer for now.95 families have now been shortlisted  205 first timer families are now out of the top 100%. (But they still have chance  just not with queue number smaller than 100)SECOND TIMER DRAWS5 units for second timer: 100 second timer families(no first timer involved)Total 100 second time families ballot for 5 units.100% SHORTLISTEDNow these 100 lucky families will be given random queue number from 1 to 100. If you are a damn lucky second timer you still can get number 1!!!!!!FINAL BALLOTNow  the rest of the 300 families  regardless first or second time  will all ballot to get a queue number from 101 onward  in this case up to 400.,btohqsg
(Note  first timer gets two lucky draw tickets  second timer only one  so in this case  205 first timer families = 410 tickets  95 second timer families = 95 tickets   total 505 tickets)HDB will shortlist applicants for up to 300% of the total flat supply.In this case those families with number 301 and above are out of the game. If you are a lucky second timer  you can get number 101 from this ballot.,btohqsg
