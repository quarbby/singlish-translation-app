Hi experts  may I know payment using Uob evol for sp bill falls under online or other spend?,btohqsg
If they reduce to 2k  maybe have more,btohqsg
So any hacks for topping up this card?,btohqsg
Now to figure out if got any lobangs.Seems like overseas FX rate is marketed as competitive and can get 1% Tesla shares. But if the Min fee is more than the amount bought  it‚Äôs kinda stupid to use this card coz Tiger will earn from fees.,btohqsg
For now I will use this as a paper weight,btohqsg
Too light for a paperweight! Lol... üòÇ,btohqsg

https://tigr.link/6xnpQwEh wait this card doesn‚Äôt charge foreign dynamic exchange rate fee and has ‚Äòcompetitive‚Äô exchange rate but charges $5 for ATM withdrawal and 2% fee.This is stupid.YouTrip can withdraw 1st $400 free  like wise for revolut also similar and trust bank card is free to withdraw.Looks like this card is not useful for overseas withdrawal of cash.Also  no can only top up using bank account and the balance on the card cannot withdraw back to back account but must transfer/clear back to the Tiger account which adds 1 more layer coz it might delay withdrawing cash.,btohqsg
I starting to wonder what‚Äôs the use case of this card.Didn‚Äôt Tiger do some market research before releasing a card into an already crowded card market. There isn‚Äôt a clear use case for this card.,btohqsg
Isn't it clear? It's to get more people onto their trading platform.,btohqsg
They would if there‚Äôs a strong use case but they released a subpar debit card so there won‚Äôt be traction,btohqsg
Hi  in order to apply for credit card the minimum age is 21 yrs right? So If I‚Äôm under 21 yrs and is it possible to apply for? I saw some videos and they said you can apply for credit card under your parents name if you‚Äôre under 21 yrs and don‚Äôt have income.,btohqsg
So the card is not under my name right?,btohqsg
So whatever rewards comes from the card is credited to my parents account right? But in order to obtain good credit score for myself at early age  the credit card should be under my name right?,btohqsg
You have no credit card record until you are a principal cardholder,btohqsg
cant seems to tally... any expert can help?,btohqsg
Guys  is there any best savings account to get interest for $10000 amount?,btohqsg
yes  spending from supplementary card gets accumulated to your parent's prinipal card account and rewards go to ur parent card account. Actually credit score is not important at all,btohqsg
what u mean? looks tallied to me,btohqsg
Opening Balance for SA is 426.82 sitting from 1st Jan until 31st Dec.. cal at 4% = $17.07Interest allocated is $34.65need to find the missing $17.58Cal $3.33 sitting from Feb to 31st Dec. 334days/365 = $0.12Cal $45.06 sitting from Aug to 31st Dec 153days/365 = $0.76Cal $51.06 sitting from Sep to 31st Dec 122days/365 = $0.68Cal $7.13 sitting from Oct to 1st Dec 92days/365 = $0.07Int sum = $1.63,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt seem attractive enough to apply for this card,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  use month or day  the ratio is same. I already calculated from the beginning of a new month.Even the $3.33 credited in Jan. I calculated it for the month of Feb up till 31 Dec.How did it tally from your calculation?,btohqsg
Maribank (2.88pc till 31 Mar)  gxs (2.68pc in saving pocket) are some of the fuss free options now,btohqsg
So if I apply now means I get only one month interest right? After that what will be the interest rate?,btohqsg
Maribank will revert to 2.5pc after march  unless they extend,btohqsg
Are we able to use the lounge upon arrival in changi airport?,btohqsg
Seems to get more leh. I counted below $30 for SA but you get more.,btohqsg
How is the calculation? care to elaborate?,btohqsg
I added all and got 23.35 but they gave you 34.65  but I did divide 12 instead. I already counted 5% because first 60k gets 1% additional.,btohqsg
Wait.. the first 60k get 1% additional dont need to satisfy the minimum of 60k first?so any balance on first 60k = add 1%?means SA = 5% instead of 4%?,btohqsg
I counted 1.78 for Jan  1.79 for Feb  1.98 for Aug  2.19 for Sep  2.22 for Oct,btohqsg
ok thanks for sharing  i rounded to 5%  and got similar numbers to your value. but still not understand how CPF get their numbers üß† by right the logic and math should add up  regardless :X,btohqsg
It's because the extra 1% for OA is actually credited to SA,btohqsg
OMG so the interest from OA 2.5% + extra 1% from OA principal goes to SA?,btohqsg
2.5% from OA stays in OA  extra 1% from OA goes to SA.,btohqsg
I just tried and finally managed to log in,btohqsg
Yes now can. Earlier today can‚Äôt see anything.,btohqsg
I had an app update during the day. Not sure if that helped.,btohqsg
u can delete and reinstall again..it happen to me but after i reinstall it work..,btohqsg
Thanks so much for clearing! the sums add up although minor decimal point.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/175380,btohqsg
First 60k compounded gets 1% more,btohqsg
Chris  for the ending question you had  I think hypothetically  if one were to transfer their OA to SA accumulated sum to FRS throughout their lifetime  then the remaining SA from mandatory contribution and interest will be ‚Äòtransferred‚Äô to OA instead of RA (since RA hits FRS made up of OA to SA transfer).However  if the OA to SA transfer (or RSTU) happens to exceed FRS  then all of which will go to RA as they are reserved sums. But it still means all the mandatory contributions in SA will be transferred back to OA.So in a sense yes SA can go back to OA  but if each dollar is non-fungible then that OA transfer/RSTU is not the dollar that gets reversed to OA  but it will come from the mandatory portion instead.,btohqsg
This is my understanding. It‚Äôs not a clear cut ‚ÄúSA can be reversed back to OA‚Äù but it depends.,btohqsg
Let's say I did not hit frs at 55. My OA has 20k minimum. My SA has 40k minimum and reserved. I invested the rest of my SA lets say 50k in short maturity assets. At 55 20k from OA + 40k from SA goes into RA. SA is then closed. I liquidate the 50k which goes into OA. Can i withdraw the 50k in cash?,btohqsg
"Incorrect assumption in the last part ""I liquidate the 50k which goes into OA.""Seehttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/what-happens-to-my-cpfis-sa-after-my-special-account-is-closed",btohqsg
I see  so hitting frs is non negotiable,btohqsg
"Not sure what exactly you mean by ""non negotiable""  there's nothing that forces you to hit the FRS if you cannot make it with OA+RA",btohqsg
I think his plan is to keep money in OA after liquidation of investment.. he do not want to transfer to RA. Unfortunately   that will not work...,btohqsg
I just transferred OA to SA in Jan so to hit FRS.. But now with this cpf changes  is my move a bad move already? I am below 55,btohqsg
Isn't frs a combination of OA and SA? So you need to manually transfer to SA to officially hit the frs?,btohqsg
