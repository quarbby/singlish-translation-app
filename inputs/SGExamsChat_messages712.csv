U intro them into the discord lore,btohqsg
I am a mere small part of that lore,btohqsg
how much did bedok get for A lvls,btohqsg
U wanna do theexplain? in my opinion i feel thats a neutral statement  just a reminder to be familiar with vector formulas  this is totally unrelated to having rights or power? i know this is off topic in this channel  you can dm reply me or in <#566986598265126912>   i dont see how any loaded language is used? i dont see how any offensive or harmful language is used? i dont see me being very agitated when typing that  and i used “please”  not even a command  which jus shows it is a little nudge  so how does “right” interfere with that statement which i said? did i command him/her? did i force him/her to memorise? did i scream at him/her when i reply (aka using caps)? and i dont see the point in this message too  i dont see what is the argument or point youre trying to drive at? many people in this server also tell me to familiarise myself with vector formulas to use  and i am just merely and simply just doing what i have been constantly reminded of  anyway you are the one taking the exam  if you cant memorise and/or understand vector formulas or you get confuse with it  it isnt the fault of anyone’s in this server cuz we have been simply reminding you things to take note  my reminder is just that extra nudge to be careful and take note. if the message pisses you off  noone forces you to view this message or pop into this channel  and noone forced or coerced you to reply. i dont see why i am controlled of what i can say and what i cannot say even though the material in that message is just a reminder  a nudge  or whatever synonyms of a similar value and tone you wish to replace with. and tbh what is your argument? such vague comments and opinions yet drive negligible value. you can reply me in dms or in a’s. i wish to not flood this channel with anything unrelated or stir anything in this channel or server.,btohqsg
Good enough to go his UK uni but not good enough for scholarship,btohqsg

1) Why do you want to be the CCA President?2) I have 5 candidates for this position  what is unique about you that makes you most suited to this position?3) What are your strengths with respect to this position? How can you contribute to it?4) What are your weaknesses that may make you not able to contribute well?,btohqsg
When replying to any interview  be it CCA or scholarship or any job interview  the general two things you must be aware of are1) Why you  not them? Or... you X factor that makes you stand out2) What can you do for them,btohqsg
inb4 the interviewer has personal beef with ur friend group and rejects u then drops out in the next 2 months,btohqsg
I just ran for exco in poly cca  they asked which animal I wanted to be  as well as how I would react when working with different types of people (in separate questions) on dominating people or people who don't do work.Ultimately I got the VP post.,btohqsg
Back in poly I was an exco for a cca and basically we had to interview our replacements. Legit we just made up questions as we went along I remember asking before what is their favourite at Mcdonalds and if they preferred the toliet paper outwards or inwards,btohqsg
cuz not experienced in it mah,btohqsg
But like legit tho it's just better to let your personality shine through and be light-hearted about it.. we hated those overly robotic and polished answers,btohqsg
Lol the people interviewing me had all their papers with questions on it and giving points for each question. Then they added up together.,btohqsg
We auto removed those who said they like Filet-O-Fish.,btohqsg
I didn't know the role included the job of vetting minutes  submitting proposals 1 month before events and so troublesome stuff,btohqsg
Totally shock me about the effort to put in before running any event,btohqsg
