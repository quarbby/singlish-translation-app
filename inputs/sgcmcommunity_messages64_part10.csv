50k depre is slightly more understandable for this car,btohqsg
Not really rhe worse thing in the world leh,btohqsg
But still if i wanna buy a 50k depre car its gonna be a ferrari or 911/caym,btohqsg
Usually the ones that come with the car  maybe because I buy used cars that's why always damn disgusting,btohqsg
You can store in the boot. But its better for you to keep in storeroom etc. because its additional weight for your car-R,btohqsg
Maggie ones also trap a lot of dirt,btohqsg
That's why those trapo kind all easy to clean,btohqsg
