Wth  this is a point to Point Service leh  the insurance should cover,btohqsg
Yeah the collision not really his fault I think,btohqsg
Admin E must be still young  < 30  years old  if not all the back pain head pain leg pain all can blame on grab,btohqsg
Wa bro  doesnt matter whoâ€™s fault. Injured is injured. Not all injuries are visible.,btohqsg
Cause he ebrake and never hit the front car alrd. Is the car behind hit us then he hit the front one.,btohqsg
I Singaporean bro  what U want me do sia? Change my nationality meh?,btohqsg
Not fair leh if not his fault but you claim from him,btohqsg
Then his insurance need to claim from the guy behind lo,btohqsg
Cus he also never get whacked,btohqsg
In this case idk if insurance will help leh. Cause he also got hit front car after the car behind hit him.,btohqsg
That time I kena accident  the guy who hit the bike  cause the bike to hit me  I also claim the bike. Then the Bike insurance claim the guy,btohqsg
Ultimately  its based on point of contact. Eh yall dont say I bad. Its the current insurance that doesnâ€™t protect us endusers. We just have to adapt to their system till it changes,btohqsg
No one will protect u  u must always protect urself,btohqsg
