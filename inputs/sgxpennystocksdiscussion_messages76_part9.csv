I think you know your counters better than your broker.If bad call  just blame yourself.,btohqsg
Isdn Cup with Handle pattern still valid. I hold on to my belief that this pattern will help break 410 resistance.,btohqsg
Chartist very good. How do u see all the different patterns..I dunno a thing about chart...last night u sent a head n shoulder...this morning sent a cup with handle...The way u able to differentiate them is damn good...Both look same to me.this cup looks like a H&S to me too...Â±±...Maybe Chinese will call it a mountain formation...got such thing or not,btohqsg
It was on head & shoulder (black) but resisted up trendline (blue). Black neckline still crucial for cut off.,btohqsg
This has new higher lows  all Moving Averages are above the lower timeframe. The uptrend has not been broken yet,btohqsg
Look at the recent PA  the probability to break up is quite good. üôèüèª,btohqsg
