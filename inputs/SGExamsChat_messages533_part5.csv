You want big  only one place‚Ä¶Good old USA,btohqsg

hannor thx for protecting pocoyo cng xoxo,btohqsg
nahh bro just didn't say that,btohqsg
looking at the positive side of things,btohqsg
pretty sure this is a dumb question,btohqsg
if the q is in joules rite then need the temperature to be in K but then when i change the temperature to K i get the wrong ans,btohqsg
isit because the specific heat capacity thing its for 1K/ 1 degree c,btohqsg
then it can be 0.129j/kg.k or 0.129j/kg degree c,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs physics related you can probs just pm me tbh,btohqsg
ok next time i just pm u lorl,btohqsg
i confirm will have a lot of q,btohqsg
Yes  because specific heat capacity is the quantity of heat needed (J or kJ) to raise the temperature of a unit mass (1 g or 1 kg) of a substance by 1 degC or 1 KA change in 1 degC is the same as a change in 1 KConsider a change of 25 degC to 26 degC  it is also a change of (25 + 273.15) K to (26 + 273.15) K,btohqsg
So for your case deltaT is (100 - 50) or [(100 + 273.15) - (50 + 273.15)],btohqsg
um yea you gotta change the actual temperatures to kelvin and not the change of temperature,btohqsg
You learning thermal dynamics in J1??,btohqsg
Yeah its time to man up and do meth instead,btohqsg
Add some rat poison while you‚Äôre at it,btohqsg
hi guys for those that jus took chinese lc jn the answers are d c c a b d b d b a rightü•π,btohqsg
