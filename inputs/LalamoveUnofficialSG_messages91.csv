Oh ya must be at lease 30yrs old ....,btohqsg
Need 2 years of driving experience,btohqsg
Ya too bad must wait 2years,btohqsg
Better then me have to wait for 10 years ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
This is gojek? Work 20hrs ah?,btohqsg
After 10 yrs maybe phv will be driverless lo  then I eat grass lo ...,btohqsg
How many hours u work bro?,btohqsg
On average 3 rides per hr,btohqsg
No cancel no choose job vaccum cleaner,btohqsg
You see the $$ you earn so fast you don‚Äôt feel like stopping,btohqsg
I only Chiong Friday sat and sun week days relax driver also can earn around $300-$400,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt tell you FC how everyone has diff cars,btohqsg
No matter what you choose don‚Äôt drive grab their earnings is only $20-$25 an hour,btohqsg
Only weekends they ‚ÄúMIGHT‚Äù give you $30per hr,btohqsg
They go by hourly rate or how??,btohqsg
Wah gojek only 1 year lucky for u,btohqsg
If you collect some data for a week you will know the truth,btohqsg
How long do you drive per day ?,btohqsg
Write down the number of hrs you work and the earnings you get,btohqsg
Ohh like own  log book uh,btohqsg
Exp: you work 10hrs and earnings $300 so 300/10 which gives you $30/hr,btohqsg
Do this the whole week or month you will see the avg earnings you will get,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like grab will cap your earnings they wouldn‚Äôt let you earn too much and also wouldn‚Äôt let you earn less,btohqsg
Oic but is before deduct expenses rite ?,btohqsg
I wonder if i use own car worth or nt haha,btohqsg

Prob with llm is you have to park  go restaurant  pick up (wait)  send  enter condo == a lot of time burnt. As compared to phv  ppl already waiting for you  send to condo also just wave in etc,btohqsg
Yes agree especially what happen to me today  pick up 2 flowers 1 send to SGH end up I can‚Äôt enter and the nurse can‚Äôt help me deliver to the receiver and the recipient can‚Äôt help me hold on the flower till the sender arrives no other way but to use live chat and burnt another 20 mins to amend the order and bring back to the sender  total burnt 1hr  1 hr parking fee gone üò°,btohqsg
So take note if send item to any hospital make sure the receiver is able to come down to collect the order if not you‚Äôre just wasting your time there,btohqsg
Actually depends on what u want n how much u can put in,btohqsg
Ur gojek earnings is very good  but for pple like me  I prob cannot tahan 18hrsüòÇ,btohqsg

I dunno abt ur gojek  but if u tell me almost the whole 18hrs u r drivg  wah thats very shag,btohqsg
But like what I said  depends on what ur looking for. Def more effort  hrs put in = more $. Its exchange health for wealth üòä,btohqsg

Not sure anyone taken order from this 3 Indian restaurantNovenaJalan besarEast Coast RoadTheir order if I not mistaken all sub out from grab foodBut almost always 2hrs lateAsk me pick up 230pmTime for delivery 12-12.30pmSomemore  they stack a few ordersOnce take food onlyGrab food customer call meCustomer call meReached already  always customer black face or kpkp u  need explain to themLate abit understandable2-4hrs lateDunno why llm still continue to allow this operator at LLM..,btohqsg
Next day kena ban lo üòÜ,btohqsg
You didn't know LLM is a last resort for restaurants sometimes not able to have their own food delivery riders?,btohqsg
Whao  i never encounter beforeBut if like this then i jus do other delivery first n go back late,btohqsg
Tmr you better ask for compensation before sending the item over wor,btohqsg
Need to safekeep one night somemore. This kind of job really make angry,btohqsg
No wonder sometime we get grab food order... But usually only these 3 Indian restaurant very late and I mean very very late.. Deliver food to customer  see the delivery time.. I also very Paiseh pass to customer.. Minimum 2hrs late..,btohqsg
Ask already  just now discuss lo  she even pay me,btohqsg
I wanted to just leave the item outside the condo cos I worry later she say she lose her item,btohqsg
So I make her write and sign agreement letter and pay the deal first,btohqsg
Anyway I don‚Äôt think I break any rules cos she beg me to keep for her and agree in my terms,btohqsg
Next time if u kena this 3 restaurants  maybe u see the grab receipt attached to it.. Hahaha...,btohqsg
Wah how much compensation you got for the trouble?,btohqsg
More then that but better not disclose üòÜ,btohqsg
Novena - 159 Thomson RoadJln Besar - 227 Jalan BesarEast Coast i never take  so i dont know addressI see the GF receipt timing i also scared  must chiong and deliver cos it happened twice in one night it became my dinner cos customer refused to accept it and it doesnt make sense to return to sender (not as if they will pay me to send back).if receipt timing is about 45-60 min before current time  still ok. if above 90min  good luck.,btohqsg
Cos I told her if I keep for her means I have to stop working now,btohqsg
for order amendments CS will cancel and reissue you the order. That usually happens after customer or yourself contact CS,btohqsg
lol the one next to katong laksa? never take before. ok will KIV and dont take,btohqsg
I nv notice when takeOnly when I takeSo weirdGrab call meCustomer call meI only work on Weekends2 weekend kena themTotal 5 customer4 customer kaopei me(I have to spent time explain to agitated customers)1 customer reject and the restaurant say u throw away den,btohqsg
I hate those 2 places jalan besar and east coast Royal bryani,btohqsg
So long waiting time that i already block them. üòÖ,btohqsg
Ytd night I also kena the same thing but I‚Äôm quite happy  got an order from royal Indian rest at Jalan baser at 12am 2 drops first drop ok second drop customer call me and fk me say I late I ask him who give you my number he say the restaurant give and I told him I‚Äôm from lalamove he don‚Äôt believe and say I lie  he also told me that the order have been completed according to his app and ask me to cancel the order  I reach his condo he don‚Äôt let me in so no way to get to his unit end up bring the meal home to my family and payment already paid by the restaurant üòÜ,btohqsg
Royal (227 Jln besar) I waited 30mins last time..Llm and panda driver kaopei them,btohqsg
Looks like Jln Besar Royal very smelly but good thing is you might have free meals lol,btohqsg
I once took at 1amThe person the eyes closed (awaken by me) when I deliver at 2amI look at receiptDelivered time by grab 12 midnightMeans when I deliver at 2amI am 2hrs late,btohqsg
I also round 2.5hrs late accord to the gf receipt,btohqsg
I mean late is okCustomer understandBut grab food delivered time 12 noonU ask me collect at 2.30pm den give me 2 placesI reach the customer place 345pmLucky this customer after listen to me and see concrete evidence of my booking call and f the restaurant.He say he nv blame me,btohqsg
Learn my lesson next time get order from customer cal me don‚Äôt ans  reach already don‚Äôt wanna open door or gate just bring home the order üòÜ,btohqsg
Follow llm Sop first drop pick and drop off 1hr second drop add 30mins don‚Äôt care don‚Äôt rush for them,btohqsg
Llm or grab shud know abt all this super late restaurantsHopefully they take abit action against themI mean late abitUnderstandableWe all have to stack hopefully 2 orders..But 2.5hrs later den ask u deliverDen grab callCustomer call and screaming sometimes..Wah lan eh..,btohqsg
Next time tell them every 10mins $2,btohqsg
Or else cancel later book again,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt wait for 2 hrs,btohqsg
Just now I heard Customer talk to restaurant got say they tried to cancel  but can't thru the app and also money have been paid..I think as what u say earlier on  the restaurant might have pressed order completedTat why customer can't cancel,btohqsg
The rest did it on purpose,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt let the customer cancel cos they know it‚Äôs late and gf customer can cancel themselves if the order never reach them within 1 hour,btohqsg
So next time just do our part can already  don‚Äôt care if the order is 2hrs or 10hrs late  or from which platforms don‚Äôt even bother to explain to them as long as we follow llm sop can already. Ask customer to call gf and complain lo üòÜ grab also lppl cos we already done our part ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
And we‚Äôre NOT from grabs platform,btohqsg
Means the cancel option will only appear after 1 hr of waiting time same goes to panda,btohqsg
While drivingKeep call meWah lan eh  kan du lanBut I understand grab or customer feelings alsoThe customer sure kan frustratedWait food 3hr plus 4hrsI talk and explain to them nicely what happenNearly all listen to my explanation and don't blame the driverOnly got 1 auntie keep screaming niaTat wan suay  but epic experience... Haha,btohqsg
Next time don‚Äôt call and their call,btohqsg
The restaurant purposely give the number to them,btohqsg
And they also give grab your number they put the responsibly to you,btohqsg
The app clearly shows the person who book is the restaurant,btohqsg
Reach already if they scold you just ignore and ask them you want the food  if you want please take if not I bring back üòÜ,btohqsg
Next time I won't take any more booking from these 3 restaurants liao...Anyway just to checkLalamove is usually1hr to deliverAdditional 30mins for next stop?,btohqsg
I also used to do Deliveroo panda and gf I always do this,btohqsg
But there is a catch many ppl don‚Äôt know,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say if you pick and drop of the first drop it only take you 30mins then it only courted as 30mins,btohqsg
Got itSo Additional stop is still 30mins,btohqsg
My friend kena better llm told my friend the first drop you took 30mins to complete so the second drop you‚Äôre left with 30mins,btohqsg
If no complain  llm wouldn‚Äôt bother,btohqsg
But if ur first drop tampines for exampleNext stop jurongMight not be able to reach,btohqsg
But as u saidNo complaintNo problem,btohqsg
Llm got a lot of dark areas üòÜ,btohqsg
Heard from my friends they also do until dulan,btohqsg
This I haven‚Äôt kena yet idk also,btohqsg
If you do stack orders better take notes if you‚Äôre late too much and customer complaints they will call you and if you give non-acceptable reason they might take action first they will blame you for taking stack orders  be prepared to get a good reason,btohqsg
Tat my worry at times as I know llm cs side Alot with customerBut till now still okMust plan well lor if want take 2nd order anot,btohqsg
But if don't stackEarn peanuts especially car rate now peanutsMotorbike rate got peak and district surchargeCar don't have,btohqsg

Hi guys  thinking of joining lalamove using car. May I know around how much can u earn daily on average using car?,btohqsg
Depends on the fare and earn up $30,btohqsg
One day can do around how many ?,btohqsg
3 order lunch and 3 order at dinner,btohqsg
One day u can earn $120,btohqsg
Me too tbh  imma a student but now is the holiday.. i've been skeptical of joining llm bc i've never work this kind of job before. What if i send the orders late  then i heard in llm if didnt stack order it not worth it?,btohqsg
I think u guys shld just try out. Everyone earns different amount. Its just how much u want to do per day. Some drivers choose jobs  some drivers take any jobs. Some do whole day  some do few hours. How can we tell u on average how much u can earn a day? Also nowdays orders also not that much. And alot depends on whether u can bid n get the job. No harm just trying it out urself  if you find it not worth it then just stop and take back the deposit.,btohqsg
Good answer to those keep asking. Haha,btohqsg
All I can say is u have to try and error to get the momentum of your orders  cos fastest finger first to secure your orders.,btohqsg
That's y have to just go try  ask too much also no use üòÇ,btohqsg
$4 per drop nt worth leh,btohqsg
See how many u can do lo . But With car can stack more. Better use hybrid car.,btohqsg
Whao  for me once i reach $70-$80 order  i will stop,btohqsg
Keep telling me i not at the location for drop off,btohqsg
And yesterday i at Serangoon garden got a 4 order nearby all i didt get it dont know is it due to gps,btohqsg
Yah. Need to stack. Haiz. If only LLM ca,btohqsg
Not the LLM GPS got problem  it is the end user that got problem  anyhow PIN the GPS location,btohqsg
You didn't get it means  got drivers stationed even nearer to Serangoon garden than you.,btohqsg
Can be other reasons. Either nearer or higher rating or they have ang kong,btohqsg
wow  now Advance job can take more then 10. so good,btohqsg
AJ can stack more then 2.,btohqsg
ya this i know. try my best to stack. üòç,btohqsg
My skills not good in stacking  still learning.,btohqsg
Here's my guidance for youI took a big risk yesterday  I am reaping the benefits from it today. All it takes is something that you would not even think of.Want to know more? Let me report spam first.,btohqsg
Even I try to stack or without stacking   earnings per hour still $20/hour hai..,btohqsg
After you do too fast always end up no jobs,btohqsg
Grab car food still can 27$ per hr,btohqsg
I think I need to close my GrabCar account the. Can open GrabCar account,btohqsg
Cos I don‚Äôt have phvl anymore,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt have phvl don‚Äôt know they still gives $27 or not not sure can register bo,btohqsg
No needJust registered grab foodGo discover find,btohqsg
Need to be PDvl then can reg grabfood,btohqsg
I also heard end of September LTA want to take away grabfood service from driver,btohqsg
Hi everyone! New to LLM here. Need some tips and advice from any one of you using cars. I understand that car parking sometimes is very hard. I took an order once from Little India on a Sunday and merchant told me to just park by the road side and collect the food. I felt too paisey to park coz it was a busy street and there wasnt any space in front of the shop to squeeze a car in. It was literally the pavement and then the road. Had to do multiple turns to find a spot. In such a case  how would you go about parking your car?,btohqsg
Like this die die must rent van Liao,btohqsg
Normally yr food will be ready most of the time just park and collect without delay  for shopping mall I wouldn‚Äôt even want to accept cos very risky . Honestly little Indra is much more easier then some shopping mall,btohqsg
"Yeah. that particular shop  food was ready for collection. but I guess I was too paisey to do that since I once used to think ""Why lah these drivers cause convenience and park here""",btohqsg
I never took any malls and especially CBD area orders before. the hassle of finding parking and all.,btohqsg
Most of the time is illegal parking for me but if you collect fast shouldn‚Äôt be a problem,btohqsg
I see. So I just have to be thick skin for that 2mins and quickly grab food and chao. Thank you :),btohqsg
Does LLM also keep track on our timing? Coz I remember theres a grace period or smth like that once we take an order right? I dont remember the training.,btohqsg
Of cos try not to park in the middle of the road üòÜ that Wan your have to train your skin to super thick lol‚Ä¶ just find a place nearby not blocking others can already,btohqsg
1 order 30mins for PU and 30mins for DO,btohqsg
YES they do especially when you‚Äôre doing stack they know and they will send msg for you to appeal if you‚Äôre late,btohqsg
A lot of things training never tell you,btohqsg
After you did something wrong and they don‚Äôt like when they start to question you,btohqsg
I bet training never tell you if you reach customer place and they want to cancel booking you will get half of the amount stated in your job card,btohqsg
They also never tell you you can ask them to amend orders if the customer item is way more heavy and bulky but your car can still able to squeeze in,btohqsg
hahaha this one  really got no space. so i had to borrow the hotel next door space to park awhile. luckily the hotel was being used as QO  so no cars were going in and out,btohqsg
I think I saw this somewhere or maybe I read this for another delivery company üòÖ,btohqsg
I think my time  they might have amended the trainings. Feels like Ive seen these few things in the training but I could be wrong.,btohqsg
Idk how to stack orders coz Im not sure if I can do it on time or not,btohqsg
My advise don‚Äôt stack better lol,btohqsg
I try a few times last week everytime I stack orders  and I finish it too fast after that you will end up in that area with either no job around your area  you jobs all very far away  once there is job around but no matter how fast you swipe you can‚Äôt get it üòÜ  even you‚Äôre the only 1 queuing for that order also can‚Äôt get  job come and disappear very fast,btohqsg
sometimes I feel like the commission is such a rip off.,btohqsg
Today I don‚Äôt even stack any order not even 1 and I manage to get more mpv jobs,btohqsg
missed plenty of good orders before coz i was too late,btohqsg
üòÜ happens to me all the time,btohqsg
Not ready is you late bro,btohqsg
but sometimes is coz I'll search map first see convenient for cars or not. haha,btohqsg
I collected last week data to know  it‚Äôs just $20 per hour,btohqsg
my first order  I think I was scammed by the merchant... he said he forgot to added in 2 more locations and he said he will call Lala. I just nod and said ok. hais.,btohqsg
Guess how many hours for this,btohqsg
are you doing this full time? how do you manage to get so much in a day?,btohqsg
Next time just collect cash from him lo,btohqsg
idk the rates at that pt of time. my first order. still nervous and all,btohqsg
so sometimes  you dont really see how much you earn but rather  you just take whatever there is?Sorry. I just need some tips on how to increase the income.,btohqsg
See extra drop how much just charge accordingly lo,btohqsg
then if its a motorcycle order  but I use car. Can I charge him using car rate?,btohqsg
I take bike car mpv which ever comes first and must be near me,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt take muti order,btohqsg
wait. whats the diff btwn stack and multi order? stack is like those multiple drops is it?,btohqsg
Muti order see $$ shiok but waste a lot of time,btohqsg
Stack is 2 different order number,btohqsg
oh multi is the multiple drops,btohqsg
Muti only 1 order number 1 pick up only,btohqsg
I see. Thanks bro. Really appreciate all your help man.,btohqsg
I always thought multi order  more $ is shiok but this might change my mind. Maybe I'll try your way instead.,btohqsg
Anything close and convenient just eat  it waste too much time choosing orders your earnings will drop,btohqsg
First few days of my llm life I keep taking cars and mpv orders only end up earnings damn bad,btohqsg
Sometimes wait 30mins to 1 hour no car and mpv order‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Depends if it convenient and near and don‚Äôt waste too much time I take,btohqsg
so basically  dont be choosy üòä,btohqsg
