The ones multi stops do we have to follow the routes given by llm or we can plan ourselves?,btohqsg

Any drivers here want to do private charter for 3hrs? Price can DM me to discuss. 6pm-9pm,btohqsg
Abit too much ask motorbike deliver 7kg Whole Durians..,btohqsg
7kg durian.. Max 4 med size durian,btohqsg
bike limit is 8kg  40x25x25cm. 7kg is under weight but maybe oversize.,btohqsg
Ya right! Either you get Covid-19 or GTFO you scammer!,btohqsg
Ya i m concerned abt the size.. Quite uncomfortable for the biker too right & risky if dont secure properly.. I was just thinking if requestor trying to pull a fast one n hoping to get car driver instead. I was 1km away but didnt want to take cos dont want to condone such ppl. So sad that ppl actually want to exploit under rainy weather conditions... Hope whoever took the job completed it safely.,btohqsg
Do u all have the high demand surcharge now?,btohqsg
Seems like user can have the option to have high demand surcharge or not,btohqsg
I saw 1 order with high demand surcharge then user cancel and rebook with no high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Demand supply one of the factors  so as more riders login the surcharge drops.,btohqsg
Yesterday raining evening also no high demand,btohqsg
Go mall carpark also heavy traffic,btohqsg
Anyway with Omicron  v soon will be back to 2 dine-in,btohqsg
So guys juz hang in there  take a short break,btohqsg
With 5 unrelated dine-in  it will spread like fug again,btohqsg

Customer ask me swipe complete then top up money for me to go there,btohqsg
How come so little orders today?,btohqsg
Think because all went out by themselves... everywhere crowded.. road also crowded,btohqsg
So far the orders with the surcharge worth it?,btohqsg
This place damn suay laa.. the traffic light often times confuses drivers/riders..,btohqsg
it's a car order  minimum should be $12.,btohqsg
So many time I reach there then they cancel.. appeal submit but no reply from lala til now,btohqsg
the agents are juggling many open issues simultaneously. Give all the information needed to take action in one posting - order numbers  issue  etc. You post a few words at a time like a casual chat will never get to your turn.,btohqsg
btw they do the same to everyone. just keep rotating their attention  they wont wait around for replies.,btohqsg
