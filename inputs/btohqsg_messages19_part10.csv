Your HFE amount doesn't actually matter until it comes to key collection. Nearing key collection HDB will request a reassessment of your loan amount  at that point the loan amount will be what's actually loaned. Now the amount is just an indicator,btohqsg
During flat selection  you pay only option fee  ranging from $500 to $2000  depending on the flat type but you should have a valid HFEPayment for the flat will be something like -Grant(s) + CPF + loan before / during key collectionIf all these are insufficient to cover the cost of the flat  person pays the balance in cash(not sure before or during key collection since no personal experience on this part yet üòù),btohqsg
Anyway horIs there anywhere that i can view samples of prelim HFE and actual HFE?Curious how they look likeüê±üê±,btohqsg
sample? no leh as each HFE is tailored individually and only accessible via one's own SingPass login.,btohqsg
Unless ppl are willing to reveal  it's not possible...,btohqsg
In case HDB has samples or specimens somewhere or maybe some blogger shared baMy google skills fail me at timesNo need to see the figures baMore of  what type of details there are in the letter unless these are also not standardized? ü§îHLE quite straightforward - loanBut like not so for HFE,btohqsg
Hello bern   thanks for the info .So what u are saying is that eg my current hfe amount can be $400k  during unit selection I can select something that costs $600k.Only when key collection time my hfe amount must be able to cover the $600k loan ?,btohqsg
Yep  you can select something that costs 600k even if your HFE is currently 400kDuring key collection  either your loan + grant must cover the full amount remaining (ie price minus downpayment) OR if it's not enough  then you need to pay the remainder in full at the point of key collection through cash (I think CPF also can),btohqsg
Ok now I understand. Thanks üòä,btohqsg
As long your cash and cpf can cover I don't think is there any issue,btohqsg
But still do not over budget if you really think  u can make itDon't over stretch  your finances,btohqsg
Do note no advertisements thank you!,btohqsg
Admin  must do work or promote more admin,btohqsg

Hi  is there a bukit merah ridge Bto group,btohqsg
Pls PM@danpatlooor@verlynhuien  they are the admins for the residents chat for Bukit Merah ridge,btohqsg
Good Morning Please advise Tengah Plantation Grove Chat Group?Thank you,btohqsg
Vincentdo message the listed admins to join their resident chat!,btohqsg
For a moment I thought which list is this üòÖ,btohqsg
Any downpayment required before key collection? I thought we have to pay 20% some time after 2k fee?,btohqsg
Yep you must pay 1st part of downpayment at the signing of lease agreement appointment - which is 10% (or 5% if you are under the staggered downpayment scheme)2nd part of downpayment is at the point of key collection  it'll be the remainder of the 20% downpayment,btohqsg
Sounds good: plenty of time to prepare,btohqsg
For some reason I thought they changed again and we need to pay 20% at the lease agreement,btohqsg
Thank God))) really hoping for CCK good Q number,btohqsg
"Anyway the appt for signing of lease agreement might be about 6-9 months* after selection appointment  so you have some time to prepare.*6-9 months was what the HDB officer told me  but do note that 6-9 months may be inaccurate now  I've heard for some people it's maybe 5-6 months. And also note if there are any ""complications""  it may also take longer  like mine was 1 year. This is because they will need to disburse EHG (if any) before the signing of lease agreement",btohqsg
Hello does anyone know when will the next sales of balance be?,btohqsg
Ya pushed to early next year. Usually is May/Nov,btohqsg
Oct launch results they say will be BY December. In means in November or in December?,btohqsg
Based on HDB's history  it will be Dec  maybe near the end of Dec haha,btohqsg
"Bleh) I wonder why ""computer balloting"" takes so long",btohqsg
bec got so many priority schemes in place,btohqsg
Could be! But no  usually when HDB gives a timeframe  best to assume it will be at the end of the timeframe. Eg if they say April  assume it'll be near the end of April,btohqsg
May I know where to see/check what is queue number now to select the flat,btohqsg
If you haveofficially received your appointment date  you can view the last queue number of the day from 12:00 AM onwards everyday  throughthis link. Help provide information by sending this toyour project's group chat  PM'ing me@smchua  or filling up thisGoogle Form. You will help the community determine the number of appointments for the day  and the dropout rate for your flat type.Updated as at 10 May 2023,btohqsg
^ you can view last queue number for the day if youve received your appt date,btohqsg
Otherwise you will need to rely on others who are able to view and share such information. Usually that's in each BTO project's chat,btohqsg
Anyone knows which other BTO has same layout? Prefer completed BTO. This one belongs to canberra vista,btohqsg
You can check mynicehome road shows  they showcase almost completed or already completed projects layout and 360 virtual tour. Not sure how far back they go back thoughhttps://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/roadshows/,btohqsg
Oh is it? Was under the impression this is a common layout,btohqsg
there are a lot of different layouts haha  some with bomb shelter in the kitchen  or at the entrance of the house  or further out into the living room  door aligned to kitchen etc,btohqsg
Or try looking at other projects launched around the same time or after,btohqsg
Hi wise ones  if for example my Q number for Oct launch is bad (like above number of flats offered in the project or close to it)  can I apply in the next launch?,btohqsg
You can still apply for next launch but will be considered as 2nd timer for a year.,btohqsg
Even if I'm unable to select a flat because of bad Q number?,btohqsg
Hello! Anyone applied HDB rental flats before? How does it work? I received appointment to go down does it mean we will choose there at TPY? or?,btohqsg
Oct launch applicants are not a lot  hence very high chance will be within supply for first timer. Those outside the total number will be given a chance too as some may drop out. As long as u have a number  cannot really participate in another exercise. Hence with this  I don't think you are eligible for the next bto unless selection cleared by then.,btohqsg
