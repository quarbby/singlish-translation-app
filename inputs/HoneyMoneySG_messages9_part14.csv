i took out my deposits immediately after i got my free shares. will probably sell my free shares soon too and cash them out. dont think moo moo  tiger and the likes will collapse like the crypto platform as they work differently  but i still dont trust these chinese companies.,btohqsg
I tried topping up $50 Grabpay with UOB absolute Amex 1.7%  then topping up JiPay $50 with Grabpay to earn Grabpoints  then topping up Grabpay $50 with JiPay card and the $50 is able to be withdrawn back to bank! Probably a glitch haha,btohqsg
Don't concentrate too much on ibkr as well. When market volatility sometimes individuals broker fail to work. You can still hedge it with other broker,btohqsg
It better to have multiple broker.,btohqsg
Well but given it's Jipay....Better to empty lol,btohqsg

Isit wrong to overpay loan amount ?Will I be charged for early payment.Currently I have this loan 4 months left but I have the cash .But if I closed the loans have to pay $150..Or shall I just over pay the full amount and wait 4 monthsAny advice in the this ?,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs better to check with your bank. Am aware some bank don‚Äôt have pre payment penalty but some have. Also it depends on the kind of loan T & Cs applicable to you.,btohqsg
If there is pre penalty  then you have to compare the interest savings vs the 150. If interest savings is more than 150 then paying off in advance makes sense.,btohqsg
