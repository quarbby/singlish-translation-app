i think it's more like blaming the learning system rather than elitism atp,btohqsg
Yeah tbh it's the separate but equal system,btohqsg
My dad knows a pe teacher there and he said students were measuring the projectile angle they need to kick the football,btohqsg
i started doing calculations with my bowling,btohqsg
Reminds me of that TYS qn,btohqsg
yes that's why i agree with that part,btohqsg
Gp i dunno coz i dunno who fr where lol,btohqsg
I mean my first lesson and I summarised the events of WW1 and got told to sit down so there's that,btohqsg
She took another 6 lessons to cover the same shit,btohqsg
It is not a â€˜lessonâ€™  it is studentâ€™s own thing,btohqsg
what's the next merger of jcs,btohqsg
I wait and see if it will be NJ and HCI  RJ and EJ  or will it be a JPJC + YIJC,btohqsg
That would probably involve merging IP JCs,btohqsg
imagine if they merge cjc and sajc tgt cos gvt ran out of options ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
vjc and njc merger would be interesting,btohqsg
Anderson serangoon tampines meridian junior college,btohqsg
I propose a SG Open University,btohqsg
lol imagine the number of government non IP JCs go down to one. Cos all 4 left merge together,btohqsg
The SC must be v stressed during morning assembly,btohqsg
Jurong pioneer yishun innova junior college,btohqsg
just make an anglo chinese university which prevents gangsters from entering cos they aren't acs boys,btohqsg
Not rlly what I mean along the lines of UKs Open University,btohqsg
They wonâ€™t retain the names of the individual JCs at that point,btohqsg
Just come up with an entirely new name,btohqsg
Na just have 1 SG JC,btohqsg
sg will run out of jcs after the mergers ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
They will say â€˜need to cherish every schâ€™s identityâ€™,btohqsg
imagine they merge acsi and sji ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Then u have like 200 classes with balloting,btohqsg
I mean for sec schs they normally donâ€™t do that during mergers so moe would just find some other way to appease ppl who are angry about the merger,btohqsg
I mean it's bad but eh. Means u can just go in and out no questions asked.,btohqsg
interesting  but the east will run out of jcs,btohqsg
Ok right people say they merge these 8 is coz they are â€˜newerâ€™ and â€˜less historyâ€™,btohqsg
imagine tmjc merging with another jc like cjc ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Should just merge YIJC with MI or create a 2nd 3 year a level course sch,btohqsg
Education should be fluid and not so fucking rigid haizz,btohqsg
atp just make one jc for every part of sg,btohqsg
Poly can only LOA for like 1 sem,btohqsg
Like that moe can lower the JC entry score to less than 20 raw,btohqsg
east  west  north  south and central,btohqsg
If not they kick u out,btohqsg
they are definitely not beating the allegations,btohqsg
But CJC is really far away fr tmjc tho,btohqsg
They can slowly lower it to 17 first then maybe later 15 raw,btohqsg
atp i am interested in seeing a yijc revival,btohqsg
I was told I wasted 2 years at RP as if I just was doing it for the cert,btohqsg
or convert yijc into a poly,btohqsg
Well they should tbh  my history cher also think 3 years for a levels should be a bit more common than it is now,btohqsg
Most of the yi students canâ€™t cope in 2 years  the entry requirements are just a bit too lax,btohqsg
Yeah but it should be more common,btohqsg
