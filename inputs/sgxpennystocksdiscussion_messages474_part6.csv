The director sold the shares a day before XD....till now don't know why.,btohqsg
But it should be personal reason  and he is not a substantial shareholder,btohqsg
Shows that they been testing this downtrend resistance and recently tried more than usual.The more a resistance is tested  the weaker it gets.Moya has been tough to play. If break this time  then we can expect big game.Now depends on BBs.,btohqsg

#Rex(Weekly)Ascending triangle by its nature is a bullish formation.Everytime it touch the upward sloping support line is already helping to reduce the existing supply.Just a matter of time to breakout i feel.Maybe 1 more touch at support is all it need.,btohqsg
