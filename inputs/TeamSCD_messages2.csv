My house nearby got a skyline gtt,btohqsg
All the car so nice  I park one corner. Don't want to park beside üòÇ,btohqsg
Since everyone is in such a good mood  let's remind the patrol prices,btohqsg
I was in my dad car and following him heh,btohqsg
Skyline. Classic. Best of all gtrs,btohqsg
But we drive pass there everyday i think,btohqsg
But i alrdy veli happy liao,btohqsg
As long as doesn't fall in nismo  is good,btohqsg
Can lay hands on a skyline,btohqsg
But well  in sg. You got a car you are good already,btohqsg
I was thinking of getting a Honda Fit as my first car leh,btohqsg
Then I install the coloured sticker over the headlight,btohqsg
Nismo is literally for aesthetic only. Performance  parts all lose skyline badly,btohqsg
Actually what you can do  fog light change to yellow led. So when you want to have the look  on the fog light,btohqsg
Then when want to drive normal off fog light can already,btohqsg
Of cuz when go inspection you either blackout or change bulb,btohqsg
Must play the Tokyo drift song,btohqsg
DO SHARE TO UR FRIENDSSSSS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
True yolo ah some ppl tint also until damn dark ok oni,btohqsg
Saw some question regarding Kia Forte. Ima ex owner  can share insights. Am i too late?,btohqsg
I think that feller installed already the bcbr right,btohqsg
Do yll prefer spray or wrap,btohqsg
i went for wrap  but i feel both got their own pros & cons,btohqsg
Interior is it same as the 09 cerato?,btohqsg
U still havent change ur colour ah,btohqsg
Never got to ride in a koup before,btohqsg
I tot u alr did sia,btohqsg
I will choose spray unless you want matte finish,btohqsg
I like white but now im looking at pearl pink white,btohqsg
ermmm‚Ä¶. HAHAH i think abit different but mainly the same,btohqsg
Er. I feel if u like to keep change one  wrap.,btohqsg
mine got the cute little outdated map above the clock,btohqsg
Personally a nice paint job makes the car look more luxurious but ya if u keep changing ah might as well wrap cheaper plus loads of cool options,btohqsg
Sometimes feel like wrap can try to diy...,btohqsg
See them do also just heat gun and pen knife,btohqsg
Coilover BCBR if you're going for slight stanceBCv1 if you want performance (conering)D2  Gekko for lowering and short term use.ECU wise  generally Forte's ECU & A/C tend to break down after the 8year mark. It a common thing. Get them replaced and you're good to go for another 10years.,btohqsg
For repair of ECU  dont need any fancy shop. Most shop can take the job  since majority would send them to a 'centralise' shop that repair these ECU. Its the price mark up that makes the difference. The 'central' shop charges $600-$700. I paid $800 for mine thru my shop.,btohqsg
Harmony preventive bla bla bla is techincally useful yet useless. I believe in 'dont repair what's not broken'. Harmony is replacing what's not broken incase it breaks. If you get what im saying.,btohqsg
Probably cheaper to buy a used ECU,btohqsg
Technically they're the exact same car. Except the 2 doors and some trims on the inside.Koup has a halo around the door speaker  forte dont.Forte might come with GPS (sx unit) koup dont.,btohqsg
For a recon  refurb used ECU  yes.,btohqsg
Harmony the ppl are nice la  but they couldn't fix why my car wouldn't go straight. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Unfortunately they're not the alignment specialist. Have you checked your camber  caster and toe?,btohqsg
In the end bc v1 solved it,btohqsg
Probably its a worn out suspension in this case.,btohqsg
Well  forte is a nice car to drive. But the 1.6 is just too cute. Doing 200 on NSHW is too taxing.,btohqsg
Very nice for a first car,btohqsg
First car usually quite shitty üòÇ,btohqsg
But sg price for that mode,btohqsg
I almost bought the hatch back sti,btohqsg
I wanted the 2.5 wrx sti,btohqsg
Rx 7 and 8 is rotary engine,btohqsg
my koup has that gps thing sx unit also haha,btohqsg
The rx8 my friend arranged the deal already. But in the end I sit inside  had to tell him I can't do it. Something don't feel right when sit inside,btohqsg
Pretty sure that dont come stock. And it has a super outdated version of map. Lol,btohqsg
ya super outdated one  should be stock leh‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt rly touch it one  bought with it there already,btohqsg
previous owner mentioned to me it‚Äôs stock haha,btohqsg
android i replace the entertainment  the gps is above the clock,btohqsg
haven‚Äôt found smt to replace that haha,btohqsg
Like another forte that going to scrap can dekit,btohqsg
Can replace it with a clock unit. The stock park for EX trim.,btohqsg
I remember the Kia fb group still got some people there. Can always post and ask if got the part,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt know how explain what that is ü§£,btohqsg
later i take 1 pic share w y‚Äôall,btohqsg
Mention the clock/gps. Most owner sld understand.,btohqsg
as in the gps  replace to clock?,btohqsg
It's a pluck and play thing. I used to do group buy for the clock unit. Bcos many ppl complain the gps is not working and very redundant.,btohqsg
oh now i get it haha paiseh my brain lagging today,btohqsg
Excuse you hello???? Got kill anot? Got ma got ma??? ü§™,btohqsg
Sorry boss.. that emoji scarred me,btohqsg
