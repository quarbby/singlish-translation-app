So far you're the first and only person that highlighted this transaction here.. so maybe you can just call fraud hotline and try to refund if the card is untouched one,btohqsg
It‚Äôs your preference. Some investors would rather go accumulating for ease of mind but some investors prefer some sort of cash flow. Do take into consideration applicable costs such as bank charges  taxes and commissions.,btohqsg

amaze link transaction excluded for dcs,btohqsg

OCBC titanium still worth to get?They nerf $1k per moth,btohqsg
I called moomoo CS üòÇ he ask me to top up my cash by redeem the sgd Fullerton fund that I have will do. I think I accidentally buy in margin because I have cash in the Fullerton cash fund.. luckily only -146,btohqsg
Yes.Just topup the negative value will do‚Ä¶ I think margin accounts must opt in separately and must do through a round of KYC. You can‚Äôt remember going through the process? Also  isn‚Äôt your cash balance known to you clearly and then buying above your cash value surely will lead to a loan‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg
"<OCBC 365 Credit Card> Anyone else requested for annual fee waiver and got rejected? üòí¬†Tried to request for waiver on app and hotline but to no avail. It says ""We regret that we will not review the matter again."" ü§®",btohqsg

Ocbc quite infamous for not waiving Annual fees and being inflexible.,btohqsg
Are u on 360 acc? If not any reason y u need this card?,btohqsg
"I thought Moomoo has the auto redemption under Smart Save to settle trades?I did a trial in Moo Moo.One will only incur margin when one buys more than what auto redemption can handle.A small ""Using margin to buy"" msg will appear above the amount due.There are also two columns indicating:1. Max Qty to Buy (Cash) and2. Max Qty to Buy (Margin)",btohqsg
yup  using 360 account. overall credit card spend for year 2023 is about $6k. thought that was ok  not exceedingly low.,btohqsg

Planning to get a luxury bag (>1000euros) during my upcoming europe trip  are there still any best credit cards that I can pair up with amaze for the best rates fx rates and credit card rewards?,btohqsg
If you don't spend 800 per month seems pointless to use that card lol.Suggest UOB One account + UOB EVOL card combination,btohqsg
I think min is $12k  so it is miss by 50%.,btohqsg
Because if you clock their cashback is 9600 only  they want you to spend 400 more lol,btohqsg
Hi all  isit worth to use Amaze + Citi Rewards overseas if I'm not going overseas yearly? Cuz amaze points expire in a year,btohqsg
Evol Ned min spend Right too ?,btohqsg
600  which is more reasonable for a 6k spending,btohqsg
Whats your intended use case?people using this don't really look to use it for amaze points  but rather the citirewards points. citirewards points last up to 60 months,btohqsg
Ya I‚Äôm not sure what I did but definitely careless at my end  but at least a lesson learnt üòÖ,btohqsg
