Aspen is all hype as they are new to glove industry and factory only up next year. And then  they will need time to build economies of scale  not to mention solving production hiccups along the way.Just personal opinion.,btohqsg
they only need 6 months to build the facility. while TG boss says normal new companies need 1 year+++ to build and even stabilize. That should mean something liao.,btohqsg
Realized profit is always better than paper profkt,btohqsg
And now the CMCO in msia  any adverse effect on the progress?,btohqsg
1. previously also got mention  Aspen has MOU with Malaysian govt linked companies that does investment. Will be easy for them to have access to govt n overseas market.2. recently Malaysia CPF invested in glove counters. Now Aspen has a few phases  next phase 1b or phase 2 they will be seeking capital funding. Guess who likely will fund them now?,btohqsg

aspen not specialist in doing healthcare product  i wont use my money invest on something on high risk. i rather use my money to invest on counter that are experience or specialist. bear in mind aspen still need money to cover their loss on construction sector,btohqsg
Got wall then got people wont buy mah  they will think ai ya no profit hard to go up. Then those who chiong later will see wall removed. Then all set sail.,btohqsg

"im saying look at overall company prospect. they have buildings. just base on Q2 u said they are ""loss making"" dont make sense.. if really loss making  u think ppl will invest in them to diversify into glove?",btohqsg
