Any idea which is the best card for hospital bill?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have several questions regarding UOB One CC. FYI I got my UOB One CC from July this year1. If I receive UOB ONE CASH REBATE BILL REDEMPTION & ONE CARD ADDITIONAL REBATE  does it mean I qualify for the quarterly cashback?2. Not so sure why but the cash rebate that I receive is $33.33  instead of $50. Is this expected?,btohqsg
1. yes2. for first quarter  if fulfilled $500 spending in 2nd and 3rd statement months will get $33.33,btohqsg
Okay thank you!So the $33.33 cashback is only valid for the 1st quarter? If I fulfilled the $500 spending for the next quarter  I‚Äôll get $50?,btohqsg
But if you don't meet $500 for the consecutive months  it's $0. No more $33.33 or $16.67.,btohqsg
Oh okay noted on that! I noticed that after I received the rebates  my statement for this month is less than $500  will UOB consider the $500 spend after the rebate/before the rebate?,btohqsg
Okay noted on that! Thank you for the help üôè,btohqsg
