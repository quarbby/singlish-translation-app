March 2023: COE supply projected to fall uniformly  even as Cat A  B and E premiums all stand at record highs üöóüìâIt appears that the end of sky-high premiums may not yet be in sight  as slowing de-registrations suggest that the COE quota for May to July is set to fall. üßê‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª Comment and share (nicely) whether you agree with our editor and your thoughts on this issue!,btohqsg
wahahahaha the censored graph got me,btohqsg
Does a high COE price mean a higher car resale value? Let's find out!https://www.sgcarmart.com/news/writeup.php?AID=692&CT=a,btohqsg
Just means if coe shoots up  used car market cannot shoot high until it turns off buyers away,btohqsg
But I've seen it'll be somewhere same depre as used,btohqsg
Not entirely true. Higher loan interest rate  rising ERP and petrol cost will deter buyers from buying cars if dealer mark up the price too high. Consumer will go for grab or rent car for short term instead,btohqsg
Not sure ur explanation is logical but anyway it's ur opinion and i respect it.,btohqsg
The qn is if a coe car and a parf car same model diff gen but same depre why wud I get it,btohqsg
I seen some coe car depre insane,btohqsg
Exactly. Of course I'm not desperate to get car right now until price is stabilise a bit given singapore small size and convenient public transport. There's no financial lost to me if I don't buy a car. Only car dealers will lose money for each day their cars are parked in their garage.,btohqsg
Without car  I can still travel to anyway in SG. Got grab  got taxi  got mrt  etc. There's always alternative to every products,btohqsg
This statement a bit misleading. Not every car. And depends on many factors,btohqsg
Every business depends on market demand and supply. I'm not grab driver so I have no rights to says can make a lot of money or not,btohqsg
