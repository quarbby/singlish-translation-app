Gg im getting canceled matcha is a minor and i said all this in the chat,btohqsg
I was referring to below 18 as minor,btohqsg
but 16-18 only has issues for exploitative rs,btohqsg
Pretty sure age of majority is like 21,btohqsg
so technically we all minors until 21 hm,btohqsg
Don't worry after I've seen the chats from rp tele grp...you are the least of anybody worries,btohqsg
Ite trollers did it's damage on there,btohqsg
how would that get you cancelled tho,btohqsg
if age of consent is 16,btohqsg
Age of consent is usually for those of same age in that case,btohqsg
16 and above can consent to anything,btohqsg
if below 18 it's only not ok for exploitative rs,btohqsg
Btw i js realised i haven't deleted space contact,btohqsg
BRO WHO TF IS THIS LURKER,btohqsg
typically the extent of control and influence one has on the other  position of authority etc,btohqsg

also for legal reasons this is just a discussion on the law LOL,btohqsg
Yeah but like who is dat,btohqsg
bro's another active member who lurks the chats,btohqsg
then is dat even considered active,btohqsg
i mean it's iffy but technically if both parties are ok  there's nothing illegal la,btohqsg
morality and ethics is a separate thing,btohqsg
Hard to prove otherwise tho that its not manipulative,btohqsg
i didn't wanna tag him but ok sure whatever floats your boat,btohqsg
Fuck this sht im gonna sleep,btohqsg

just like how you have the freedom to say weird stuff in the sge discordyt also has the freedom to post the screenshot of the stuff you said in public spaces,btohqsg
theres probably gangsters there for all you know,btohqsg
Bro you don't want me to get In discord I was known as the discord detective on there,btohqsg
I literally went through thousands of logs to get ppl who casually mentioned their age/or less people to believe they are underaged ban from discord servers,btohqsg
I was practically doing what the mods were too lazy to do because I had too much free time,btohqsg
if any1 wants to know tht rp admin tea,btohqsg
i went to dig for it,btohqsg
‚Äúim from the prestigious ite north‚Äù,btohqsg
I don't have discord on my phone now,btohqsg
"https://t.me/RPAY23/91881when i went inside the rp chat to ""rage"" on her",btohqsg

I'm always the one making others tilt,btohqsg
basically sgexams discord destroys your rep,btohqsg
Oh  it‚Äôs not possible ah? I thought degree and dip any age can study,btohqsg
this yr ntg yet except CynthiaüíÄüíÄüíÄ. we don't talk abt tht,btohqsg
I think I am? For this part but idk and I don't really care if they think I'm.on the spectrum,btohqsg

they started spamming. i was actly having troubleb trying to ban them cuz to many messages at once,btohqsg
idk lah. he on the spectrum,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ the hell,btohqsg
Guys supposing someone who make you sad alot gets scolded by the teacher will you be happy or ÂøÉÁñº,btohqsg
Aiyo should have made it a parallel circuit,btohqsg
why cant people just act normally... talk normally. behave normally... just be a decent person. it doesnt even cost any money to be a well-mannered person but... sigh,btohqsg
But most of them don‚Äôt even carry over to the real world lol,btohqsg
I've studied this in depth and I've come to one conclusion. It's not that they can't  they don't want because acting the way they do yields them more attention and they crave it.It does not matter if it's bad  it's still attention on them,btohqsg
if u wanna get hate comments then sure,btohqsg
actually thank god this yr onwards is non graded,btohqsg
i can tell you that i have ip friends in raffles who are constantly babbling to me about some crazy tea and gossip that happened at their school,btohqsg
Imagine I go that discord server and I see familiar faces,btohqsg
Oh btw habibi5201 last time you said there was this girl in your ori that went on stage?,btohqsg

People who do this stuff just want attention,btohqsg

im planning to get my group to do some research during the weekendss,btohqsg
2 of the girls came to our grp then complain abt their pw mate,btohqsg
i know im j1 and we are all in the pass fail pw era,btohqsg
Generally the temp groups r the real groups,btohqsg
bro you know it was so bad that the teachers gave up and let us choose our own group,btohqsg
there's no way this is temproary,btohqsg
imagine if seab raises the pass standard to a pw A in previous cohorts,btohqsg
I'm now nearing 20  I went to imh at 12 for anger issues. I left my yield for anger there when I went  it never went back with me,btohqsg
ya bro bc literally nobody cooperating,btohqsg
the teachers are supposed to choose it????,btohqsg
what jc are you in wtf,btohqsg
but everyone went back to their clique after 10 secs,btohqsg
habibi5201 say during ori got 1 girl run on the stage and he wanted to be friends with her cause she seems friendlyThen josh said.that he want habibi5201 and the fmaths girl to get tgt,btohqsg
But from what ik generally shld be what,btohqsg
ya  idt sg will have a 100% pw pass rate until skibidi toilet gets deleted from YouTube,btohqsg
Ppl who got shitty o lvl eng grades,btohqsg

Srly hope things get btr man,btohqsg
My year  the o levels English paper  70-80%of the qns tested on sec 2 comprehension,btohqsg
That year   my batch did not do well for o levels english,btohqsg
Wait@habibi5201did i tell you about door girl,btohqsg
Everybody was studying the heck out of all the upper sec English qns but very few remembered how they tested us in lower sec,btohqsg
Fyi  my English o level Compre had no cause and effect,btohqsg
ok ill just paste it here for the benefit of all,btohqsg
@phxrqi wanted to go ny and take advantage of their loophole to do sci  but during jae i heard hints of the loophole getting patched so i went to ej (nearer to my house than vj thats why),btohqsg
One of my classmates was angry and slammed the door on a girl whose arm was reaching through the door to grab her. She ended up fracturing her arm and spent the next 6 months in the hospital,btohqsg
not certain jae students making us jae kids look bad üò¢,btohqsg
Some ppl just like that sia,btohqsg
I do the combi but geog h1,btohqsg
if you want to do 4h2 at least do pcm or bcm,btohqsg
It's normal  bad vibes sometime occur and you feel it,btohqsg
dont do a combi where it limits your uni choices,btohqsg
I see the content for H2 geog iw to shit myself,btohqsg
i thought some science courses need h2 double science?,btohqsg
or else you need to take bridging in uni,btohqsg
it only cock block med and dentistry iirc,btohqsg
But that one is like for me,btohqsg
and i heard pharm science as well?,btohqsg
I literally can't qualify cuz I no o lvl bio bg alrd,btohqsg
uhhhh but it's high risk high reward,btohqsg
you can do phys and chem and still go for med and dentistry apparently,btohqsg
H2 maths + 1 H2 sci,btohqsg
i didn't plan on gg ny although my friend wanted me to consider,btohqsg
But honestly the cock block of uni,btohqsg
no both pharm and pharm sci is H2 chem + H2 math / bio/phy,btohqsg
that was only when i realised i couldn't make the cop for acsi,btohqsg
i got 8-2 instead of 6-2 üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
because no bonus points for prelims,btohqsg
oh you're the first person i heard outside sch that did worse than prelims,btohqsg
i think i was high during exams,btohqsg
but is it like 1-2 points or worse,btohqsg
brother i 11-2 how to go acjc sci,btohqsg
7-4/6-4 easy entry to raffles science,btohqsg
Anyway im thinking of smth fun,btohqsg

Get A for GP or wtv,btohqsg
he say some weird ass shit,btohqsg
because chem is more useful than standalone bio/phys,btohqsg
what's the gender ratio of your pw group,btohqsg
Assuming the groups are chosen using a random neutral AI with no biasProbability of boy in my pw group = 1/5Probability of girl in my pw group =1/20,btohqsg
cos my class is the bio class with 18 girls,btohqsg
praying ill get a 1:1 ratio,btohqsg

Depends on how well UK the person also,btohqsg
just now i told my cca pres abt exco,btohqsg
"the girls keep on saying ""foul""",btohqsg
You notice that if you tease someone  the statement made is not targeted it's directed,btohqsg
If it was actually hate  it would be targeted not directed,btohqsg
also i think ppl want to nominate her for class chair :/,btohqsg
Sorry I wanted to say keep it pg,btohqsg
Wow the drama here is real,btohqsg
