nus mod bidding is very fair,btohqsg

dang government rly too much money,btohqsg
is more of selling why u want the course or selling urself as in ur achievements,btohqsg
i nvr wrote anything in my ps I think . don't think they rly care unless u have some insane achievements (I might be wrong),btohqsg
my cringiest moment was my lecturer asking me to write a recommendation letter myself and then showing him ...,btohqsg
they linked the aba framework lul,btohqsg
personal statement generally got 2 diff kinds,btohqsg
so emphasis for that one is on the achievements and how your abilities align with the course,btohqsg
the only parts of why you want it should be on the alignment with your goals,btohqsg
i had to do this for my postgrad applications lol,btohqsg

uh no they will ask u declare major before matriculation  then u can change ur declaration every sem up to end of y2s2,btohqsg
for choice of majors can change to any as long as its the non restricted ones  if you don't meet the prereqs then just take the bridging mod first,btohqsg
