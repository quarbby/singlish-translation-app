Cause their welfare and stuff gets protected,btohqsg
Whats the diversity of opinions in that,btohqsg
This is so complicated to explain,btohqsg
Like so raise awareness on the welfare of sexual violence survivors,btohqsg
Uh huh but no link to diverse opinions,btohqsg
The diversity of opinion will allow more to voice out and what they think are someone some of the welfare of this survivors,btohqsg
so that this opinions can be added and really being ensured to become a welfare,btohqsg
Thats just having a voice on a platform sis .-.,btohqsg
a lot of people wrote the Same things,btohqsg
diversity here means having a spectrum of opinions,btohqsg
Eg allowing anti abortionists to have an opinion on abortion rights,btohqsg
To the same degree as pro abortionists,btohqsg

Or allowing flat earthers to propogate their theory etc,btohqsg

maybe all jcs have been playing this ball game wrongly sia,btohqsg
its 500-800 but i‚Äôve been taught to write 3 As and 1 CA+R,btohqsg
but if language is good then why not ngl,btohqsg
prob btr to certain extent cos its more concise for readers,btohqsg
i was taught 3As and 3CAs sia,btohqsg
wont that look like ur sitting on a fence,btohqsg
they said 3As 1 CA is bare minimum,btohqsg

We can do it!!hopefully it is easy,btohqsg
Maybe average? If it is difficult  the bell curve will save us but if it is easy  the bell curve tp get A1 will be higher,btohqsg
