hello can ask if accept a order. is it max must be there in 30min?,btohqsg
Ya I think so. Unless scheduled arrangement,btohqsg
same. just activated yesterday and did 1 order only ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
"Unless is advance job  have to be there within ""10min grace period"" from pickup time",btohqsg
Anything past 10min  u likely will get late notice.,btohqsg
Maybe that's why bot rose don't react to cashout or cash out anymore,btohqsg
For oddle  think these days as long as u deliver within the timing indicated in the comment  they wont bother u,btohqsg
Oddle customers v funny one. Deliver early they will ask why come so early blablabla,btohqsg
Can say so... But for oddle  tricky hor. They notice you got late  they don't give u late notice liao  they just ban you from seeing their orders. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
They only ban if u late deliver ba,btohqsg
Then u have to bug CS many times before they MIGHT review for you,btohqsg
And u wont be able to see order for the rest of the day if they cancels any of ur existing order from oddle,btohqsg
Aka only can see the next day,btohqsg
Yup. Some ppl cannot see for few days,btohqsg
Not worth to do LLM if no oddle  cuz lesser + I feel  higher chance you kena track by non-oddle customers and good luck getting orders along the way. Hahaha,btohqsg
Imagine they lost oddle as client,btohqsg
Which also mean  higher chance your rating can drop,btohqsg
Lol ðŸ¤£ then GrabExpress will take over ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Lol  u can try lor. Go collect late few times then u know,btohqsg
N u mostly late ah? By how many mins,btohqsg
Hahaha. They won't bother you  oddle just ban with no warning de,btohqsg
Llm will call u sometimes if ur late for pickup,btohqsg
The thing is if everyone starts being late for pickup  later llm start imposing more rules for stacking  then that makes it harder to make money,btohqsg
It's not just abt oddle  it's also abt llm. So choose ur words wiselyðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Don't late la. Best is on time.,btohqsg
Recently llm nvr sms pple for lateness. Still remember couple mths back so many pple kena  n kena suspend,btohqsg
And don't take orders stack liao  end up cannot do and MIA.,btohqsg
Feew minutes late for pickup also kena sms,btohqsg
Advance job 10mins grace. Immediate job 30mins,btohqsg
U still got do llm ah,btohqsg
We miss your iconic market trolleyðŸ¤£,btohqsg

U just build up ur momentum first,btohqsg
Or same location 2 different parcels send to 2 nearby location?,btohqsg
I no chan smell blue moon. Too tough to achieve,btohqsg
I 1 day intend to do 1 to 2 maybe 3 trips only.,btohqsg
