Hi everyone  thinking of switching from OCBC 360 to UOB One account  to get the higher 3.85% (salary + spend). I can‚Äôt get 3.85% on OCBC (salary + save + spend) coz they rejected my CC application. Since UOB accepts spend via debit card  I‚Äôll just use the UOB One debit card. My question is  for the min spend of $500  are there any specific categories to take note of? Like for EVOL  certain categories give more cashback. Does the $500 include paynow/paylah spend too? Thanks!,btohqsg
UOB evol is a credit card though. and no paynow / paylah spending,btohqsg
Hi everyone   for the 200k earmarked for uob Oct promo . can I split 100k into uob one and another 100k for stash account to get the S$1 458Cash Credit Amount?,btohqsg
I found this too. Just wanted to confirm if there‚Äôs any special category that will earn more cashback. I guess there‚Äôs none then. Thank you!,btohqsg
Wait for UOB to release the updated TnC if there is new promo.,btohqsg
Usually can only choose one account number to participate.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  just to check if UOB Lady‚Äôs card when selected fashion can qualify for miles when spending in overseas premium outlets like those in USA and Malaysia?,btohqsg
Must depend on the individual shops mccs. But mostly can.,btohqsg
Kinda curious also cos i participate on 30 aug,btohqsg
Depends on the merchant mcc code. Some merchants are under family. Eg. Animation worldSome merchants are not in any category. Eg. Anta  G-Shock,btohqsg
Hi all Latest UOB national savings promotion is out.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.htmlI had emptied my balance from UOB ONE for this promo and hoping to top the account back as fresh funds for this promotion... Not sure if im reading and understanding this correctly  but in the link where it says in footnote 3...3‚Äôearmarked‚Äô means that the Incremental Fresh Funds deposited will not be reflected in the Eligible Account statements and cannot be withdrawn. ‚Äî> does this mean that if i were to top up the amount into my UOB ONE account  the amount does not show up in the account statement (and as such not allow me to get UOB ONE interest?). Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob earmark 5%‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
where s the participation form ah? i keep finding on the web nothing,btohqsg
oh i see it sorry !,btohqsg
Have 18k in uob one now  if I were to deposit 100k to earmarked it in now. Can I just withdraw out the 18k afterwards?Or can I withdraw out now before I deposit? Sry for the noob question.,btohqsg
It is stated in the TnC. Read the link posted above. See Clause 2.2.,btohqsg
So you mean  this apply to new customer don‚Äôt have UoB account and open a stash account before end of the year?,btohqsg
Unless they change it from previous promo,btohqsg
Hello guys  I‚Äôm not sure where or who to ask so I hope this isn‚Äôt the wrong place.Basically I have a lump sum of money  north of 150k  which I won‚Äôt be using for the next few years. I‚Äôm currently 22 and have zero idea of what can be done with it. The information online is overwhelming too and I don‚Äôt want to make a wrong choice because of my lack of expertise.Can anyone recommend high interest accounts I can consider? I‚Äôm studying in the UK at the moment so can consider UK accounts as well.,btohqsg
Happy to see that we have 10 000 members in this Community now!,btohqsg
9 999 the bot don‚Äôt count üòÇ,btohqsg
Congratulations on your strong balance sheet at 22! You deserve a pat on your back for being prudent and hardworking to accumulate this üëçüèª my view is that you can invest in SSBs if you are risk averse and at your age  able to withdraw anytime without losses as and when you need the money for your next phases of life,btohqsg
The uob promo can register now and transfer 100k back ?,btohqsg

Hi all  correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  UOB Christmas funds earmarked 4 months promo on incremental funds  at max 200k  $1 500 credit is only 2.25% per annum?,btohqsg
Same  I calculated 2.25% p.a. too. Is it because this Christmas promotion is on top of the bonus interest from UOB one account? 2.25% p.a. for 200k locked up for 4 months ü§î,btohqsg
Actually if that‚Äôs the case  CIMB SG promo of 3.5% flat with full flexibility of a normal savings account wins hands down. No upper limit some more,btohqsg
Actually it doesn't matter if personal or corporate account  changes can be made instantly. The issue with corporate account is you need maker checker approval process. In the case of SME or large companies  besides having HR to process the crediting account request  it also needs internal approval in the banking system.If your employer is a small SME and you are closed to the boss or HR  can be done very fast,btohqsg
Sorry guys  can I ask if I can use uob evol card for public transport to hit 600 min spend for Cashback and 500 for the higher interest,btohqsg
Agree. But I think some folks already having the UOB one so 2.25 is on top of their existing upto 7.8 from UOB one,btohqsg
For POSB everyday card if I pay spc petrol via googlepay will I still enjoy 20.1% saving? Or must use physical card?,btohqsg
I just enrolled in the uob savings promo so can I transfer funds now or wait for confirmation,btohqsg
Have you tried using Google pay?,btohqsg
think no need transfer funds today. Any transfer today will only be reflected tomorrow anyway.,btohqsg
But transfer tomorrow will only be effective day after  ie 3 Oct?,btohqsg
why u say so? FAST should be immediate if on a workday.,btohqsg

You can consider DCA-ing into index funds of maybe 7k* a month for a year* (84k total) and continue to DCA into the index fund less aggressively while putting enough monies in a HYSA for a 1* year emergency fund.The index funds are there to growlong termso we're maybe looking at 15 year time horizon!* refers to numbers which you can tweak according to your preference.,btohqsg
No I have not  but I'm thinking about it. Tnc was not clear,btohqsg
Can I know if there is some saving promo from uob? I want to transfer my money from ocbc to uob ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
