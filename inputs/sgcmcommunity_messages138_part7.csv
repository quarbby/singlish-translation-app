Coe is bid by the dealer ?,btohqsg
No we put deposit then dealer wait for us to get our coes,btohqsg
Is it ? I not sure how they bid,btohqsg
Very rare in sg the person ownself bid then go buy car,btohqsg
Cus dealers also earn from ur coe,btohqsg
Within the car price eg car 120k coe maybe they budget inside 40k for coe,btohqsg
But maybe when bid bid 30k,btohqsg
They lucky they get then earn 10k liao,btohqsg
So the increase also cost by the bidder,btohqsg
Uk how coe is calcated also right the price?,btohqsg
Eg 100th person bid amt from 50k to 100k,btohqsg
Im pretty sure today coe 103k confirm got someone go throw in bid 120k de,btohqsg
U wait ah i ltr explain i driving,btohqsg
Or some other expert ltr reply u,btohqsg
They will take the 101th bid and plus One dollar,btohqsg
Then 1 to 100th bids is ranging from 75k to 150k,btohqsg
But they all only pay 50k COE,btohqsg
I think no need understand also can,btohqsg
I dare say 90% of us donâ€™t buy brand new car fresh from the oven,btohqsg
