hi guys  anyone knows if uob mighty fx account is able to get the 7.8%* interest too with one account‚Äôs consolidated balance?,btohqsg
(3) and (4) has min spend to unlock the max cashback but they only cover 2 out of the 3 things each that you mentioned. (2) does not have any min spending but it needs to be within the spend type and merchant to earn the bonus points. (1) earns points only for yuu merchants  no min spend unless you want the bonus points,btohqsg
do u have 360 account? ocbc 365 has good cashback at diner. the catagories you mentioned are not so rewarding for this card i think,btohqsg
I do  but my cash backFor 365 card has been very bad last couple months since I dined out lesser since Covid,btohqsg
you can keep this card if you want to earn for the bonus interestüòÇ,btohqsg
Icic. So maybe I should cancel my dbs yuu and ocbc364 then?. Then just apply for OCBC NXT or any other OCBC card to hit the $500 spend?,btohqsg

Is 90N card the best alternative for general spendings (pairing with ocbc 360 for additional interest) if i cannot hit $800 monthly on 365 card and i don't buy stuff online enough for titanium card?,btohqsg
General spending use 1 miles card Is better . Eg. Citi Premier or dbs attitude card,btohqsg
Are duty-free stores at airports considered eligible purchases for OCBC titanium card?,btohqsg
You can claim from both but need to claim one at a time. Reason being  you will be asked by the 2nd insurer the settlement letter as proof from 1st insurer that they have paid and how much they paid.,btohqsg
Thanks Nairo.. but if decided to buy from same insurer? Or this is not advisable?,btohqsg
