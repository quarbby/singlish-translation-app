Unpopular Controversial Opinion or Conspiracy Theory : Banks are purposely holding back on Credit Card Applications Outcomes.In the youtube video shared by HMSG about Credit Card Fee Waiver 2 days ago - he shared the avg cost of acquisition of a customer can be around $250-500. Hearing everyone‚Äôs experience on how they are delaying CC Appln Processing - I feel like maybe it‚Äôs not overloaded  but rather they may be doing it on purpose. Let‚Äôs take an example of UOB. Personal experience : I opened a UOB ONE Account and applied for EVOL together. ONE Account opened in 3 days. EVOL pending for 1 month. Think about it - most of the processes are automated  we all apply online  no forms that need to be manually filled etc. They can open the ONE account so quickly but keep the CC Appln pending forever. Is it a strategy to reduce their cost of acquisition maybe? For ex : If you hold $100k in UOB ONE  spend on CC  add salary : you get about $200 per month cashback/rebate. If they dont give you a CC  you dont have this CC spend obviously  you only get $4 cashback. That‚Äôs a great way to ‚Äòclaim back‚Äô their cost of acquisition by $196 every month of delay.So maybe a good strategy would be to first get credit card with a bank  before opening a savings account - so they can‚Äôt do this kind of thing. Thoughts?,btohqsg
Or they already hit their monthly kpi and are perhaps pending new applications to roll over for next months kpi üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Can pay through instarem to fufill the $500 for citi rewards card?,btohqsg
If you are new to SG  you might have some issues getting credit cards. As a singaporean  I just returned to SG after working overseas for 6 years and had no credit history in Singapore  had quite a few rejections despite high income. So you should think about getting a debit card / e wallet to use first for the first few months  grab wallet and revolut are the best bet for now  and wait until at least 3-6 months of payslips  at least from what I understand,btohqsg
