Then the marquie report came out in tandem,btohqsg

I never take profit then become loss,btohqsg
No one knows. Did MT release rumors they have 100x profit for the price to climb 3 cents to 90 cents?,btohqsg
100x propel it's share price from 1 to 198,btohqsg
Vicplas only 60 cents. And it didn't start so low from 3 cents,btohqsg
I mean VP isnt a pure medical business & no one can actually predict how well Forefront does,btohqsg
So imo vp results is a gamble,btohqsg
Ryan vested in VP is it,btohqsg
Not like TG everyone knows is either 1bn profits or it's not,btohqsg
Of cuz we wont know how high vicplas can go up to. But neither will it definitely drop aftwe result announced,btohqsg
