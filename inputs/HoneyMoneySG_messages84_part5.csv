Hi  can I check if this is correct way? I have deposited $1600 into UOB One saving account but have not see the stage fulfilled for salary crediting,btohqsg
Nope as basically they selling their bandwidth to them like open door let you use also ~ Can just think of it as you signing up for SingTel but from third party vendor like they basically just resale SingTel services and slap their name on it,btohqsg
paynow from where? chose purpose as 'salary payment'?,btohqsg
I used fast transfer and was fulfilled the next day.,btohqsg
I used DBS Ibanking app and chose Paynow Transfer  but there isnt a place that I can select Salary so I input “PAYNOW SALA” under the comment,btohqsg
use the web browser if cant find the selection in app,btohqsg
then not counted  use FAST and chose purpose as 'salary payment',btohqsg
Ok thanks 🙏🏻 will try when I’m home using my laptop browser. As I used phone safari browser I’m not able to do it,btohqsg
Just to check  if still possible to transfer from OCBC to UOB using web browser ?,btohqsg
I read it’s no longer possible,btohqsg
Use “Transfer money” in DBS apps  not Paynow transfer.,btohqsg
Sorry 1 more question  for the spending $500 with eligible cards + salary crediting cut off date is when? Is it as long as within 1st day of the month and last day of the month?,btohqsg
It is based on transaction posted date. Some merchants take 1 day to post n some merchants take 3-4 days to post. No definite answer to your question.,btohqsg
OCBC website only via PayNow. DBS via digibank app fast transfer.,btohqsg
Spending is by transaction posted date withincalendar month. Not to be confused with cc spending statement date.Salary credit also bycalendar month. Remember FAST transfer has cut-off times for immediate transfers as well.,btohqsg
I’m using Digibank and click on “Transfer Money” which one should I select? There is no Fast Transfer selection though,btohqsg
If you're doing this monthly  suggest you add your UOB bank account as a local recipient to make things easier. But one time transfers can be done by clicking on local button.,btohqsg
Like this correct ? I can ignore the comment right,btohqsg
AMEX True CB CC- 3%CB in the first 6 months.,btohqsg
Just curious.. Does this work for OCBC 360 accounts?,btohqsg
I see  Thanks for the prompt reply,btohqsg
Thanks everyone 🙏🏻 this is what shown on my UOB Account now. will monitor to see if I have unlocked the salary crediting part . But I have not unlock the spending so wondering when is the cut off,btohqsg
Card transaction must bePOSTEDby end of month as shared by others.,btohqsg
I haven’t try using OCBC to UOB yet but someone above told me can only do so on OCBC website via PayNow,btohqsg
think he asking about salary crediting to ocbc,btohqsg
Oh I was asking if I could bank transfer to an ocbc 360 account with the salary payment  so that it's treated as I've fulfilled the salary credit criteria,btohqsg
I can reach $500 .. but now my main cards are not uob lol I have uob one card which is redundant I don’t use much and just applied uob lady which I chose Fashion (should have chosen dining lol),btohqsg
Since it’s fashion  can see if there’s any vouchers on Heymax that you will use. Like Amazon  Grab  Foodpanda etc. Vouchers purchase on Heymax falls under 5311.,btohqsg
So your 500 spending on dining? Is it eligible?,btohqsg
Ok.. thanks 🙏🏻 I have heard about heymax but not really sure how to use it yet  will explore this option,btohqsg
I suppose if I use the uob lady on other categories still counted into $500 bah? Just that I can’t earn 6mpd since it’s not fashion category,btohqsg
Don’t waste the 6mpd please haha.,btohqsg
I’m sure you can find something on Heymax! There’s even Sephora and NTUC vouchers,btohqsg
Oh you were the one who wanted to buy pet food? I saw Pet Lovers Centre Gift Cards too 😅,btohqsg
Just download the app can explore it,btohqsg
Yes I’m the one haha but Pet Lover like more exp 😂 but if no choice I will get that,btohqsg
Hi  is it worth it to sign up as krisflyer member ?,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone know if Road tax payment for ocbc count as 500 min spending?,btohqsg
Hello  can i clarify with you guys whether the Maybank card signup for new to bank can get me 10k kris miles and also $60?The 10k miles seems to be from Maybank promo itself  while $60 is from Singsaver cause i can only select $60 reward from Singsaver form.,btohqsg
Usually welcome bonus is one or the other,btohqsg

But if i sign up through singsaver and theres 10k miles advertised  those rewards arent reflected in singsaver form,btohqsg
10k miles reward is by MayBank not SingSaver. SingSaver got no promo for that card now.,btohqsg
Yup i signed up last month for $60 from Singsaver. But does picking Singsaver reward mean i wont get Maybank promo?,btohqsg
@Dpgg94this promo right? Then you should get both if you're a new Maybank cardholder based on Chris' message.,btohqsg
