Then just use Citi cashback + with instarem amaze,btohqsg
üëå ok  thanks. I will try it,btohqsg
My Citi cashback is a VISA card and unable to pair with Instarem amaze. Do you know if Citi allow me to change to MasterCard ? Thanks,btohqsg
Just apply for a new one using my linksüçØ,btohqsg
And keep the visa one since it is discontinued. Then u have two cards to choose from if you need to max it out one day,btohqsg
seems that MasterCard is gaining some edge over VISA  especially for GrabPay top-up feesü§î,btohqsg
Buy 100 Qcoin then have 2%,btohqsg
Now that I just checked  they seem to have removed that 100 Qcoin option,btohqsg

Kenna losing faith in investing. I see the whole portfoilio red  also no feelings. Cos I'm numb already,btohqsg
Need keep some spare cash if not no money buy in hahah,btohqsg

But brokers like tiger and moomoo hard to DCA ? isn't syfe easier to DCA monthly,btohqsg
By the way anyone knows when uob absolute credit cashback  I have been topping up grab pay wallet but haven't received any cashback since sept,btohqsg
"Hi guys  I know in times like this it is really tough and I'm not going to sugarcoat things here. The stock market has been correcting/crashing hard the past few weeks and is at ultimate Fear  Uncertainty & Doubt. In times like this when you don't have spare cash it is pointless to say things like ""buy more into the dip""  so I will just share some things you could do.1) Cut loser stocks which you have low conviction in  and add to your high conviction stocks which may have fallen too. Consider it a portfolio slimming diet2) Do nothing and diamond hands all the way. Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing.3) Sell a portion of portfolio that enable you to sleep well enough. Nothing matters more than your own health.But whatever you do  just don't sell your winners and add to your losers  things rarely work out that way.#NOTFINANCIALADVICE",btohqsg
Bonus: Have some crypto as diversification  though they have pretty run up these two weeks as well,btohqsg
I think the cashback will automatically be credited in the following month‚Äôs statement. ie cashback of sep‚Äôs spendings will be credited in oct‚Äôs statement,btohqsg
@yumsushiis right. Usually 2 months after spend,btohqsg
It's abit unfortunate that when I start investing this happens. But before that  market had a bull run since mar 2020,btohqsg
I would say it's fortunate to see the market crash as a beginner ü§£ cuz now I'm young and not rich  so the impact of market crash will be very limited,btohqsg
the market is doomed to crash at some time  so the sooner the better,btohqsg
i think etfs still quite ok now,btohqsg
Can we enjoy the cashback benefits when using the instarem card be used to pay bills and insurance. Then link to a cashback card,btohqsg
Bills no  insurance unknown for 1% amaze cashback.For the linked card  if your card doesn't award rewards then linking it to amaze woudnt change anything too,btohqsg
So what are the compactable credit cards with amaze cashback?,btohqsg
You can use the following cards for the best cashback/rewards with Amaze:Citi Cashbackhttps://bit.ly/HM-CitiCBCiti Cashback Plushttps://bit.ly/HM-CBPlusCiti PremierMileshttps://bit.ly/HM-CitiPMCiti Prestigehttps://bit.ly/HM-CitiPrestigeCiti Rewardshttps://bit.ly/HM-CitiRewardsDBS Woman‚Äôs Gold World Mastercardhttps://bit.ly/DBS-Woman-WORLDMCPOSB Everydayhttps://bit.ly/POSB-EverydayUOB Ladyhttps://bit.ly/UOB-Lady,btohqsg
What are the reccomend best cash back credit cards for students Vs new working adults?Uob one?,btohqsg
Student: maybank evibes/cimb awsm > grabpayNew adults: uob absolute amex > grabpay,btohqsg
This qn might be subjective or depends on own perspective but i just would some opinions. Does the normal cashback from say Evol or Frank card better or absolute amex > grabpay better?,btohqsg
Since Evol & Frank cards has cashback from online aka grab transactions  i can get cashback right? üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
as long as you can hit their spending minimum..,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Alright thanks guys ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Saw@ChrisHMSGYouTube poll about syfe's explaination email for their poor performance  anyone convinced by that ?,btohqsg
Anyways the market lately is not doing well so definitely will be hit  I am curious why they need to have an email explanation to justify their poor performance? Like they feel guilty or something üòÖüòÇ hahaha,btohqsg
Is the email to all customer?,btohqsg
Yes  sent around 11am.I'm also suprised why they need to explain. It's not an active fund like ARKK,btohqsg
Perhaps because 100% of their portfoilios are negative returns? (for ordinary people without referral bonus).Be it core growth  equity 100  retis  custom  thematic  you name it  all negative returns regardless of DCA or lump sum.,btohqsg
Market in general not doing well.. probably money creeping towards crypto,btohqsg
if arkk explain i get it,btohqsg
Most popular but 100% portfoilios slumped into bear market? Strange !,btohqsg
Not surprising since they have the most outreach in social media,btohqsg
Just look at IG posts tagged with Syfe,btohqsg
Yahoo Singapore News: 3 REITs Falling Close to Their 52-Week Lows.https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-falling-close-52-040000793.html,btohqsg
"I remember that there was a sg youtuber who said ""it is the best time to invest in syfe retis when inflation rises"". Bet he misled alot of people to lose their hard earned savings",btohqsg
Maybe that's why I'd probably not get a sponsor there,btohqsg
"Speaking of which  the community poll now has more ""Yes  acceptable"" for Syfe explanation now",btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if@ChrisHMSGwill allow me to share other youtube channel videos here or not lol. But is one of the channels mentioned in the polls recently,btohqsg
anyways syfe say until like it is sept that is pulling the performance down  but i just saw Chris's review  since July also negative returns,btohqsg
Yup. Really really awful and depressing performance from syfe,btohqsg
No need to share the video of other youtuber here. But those who kaypo can ask them pm you,btohqsg
Since syfe's ongoing poor performance  should be continue to DCA or  wait for things to settle down,btohqsg
Thanks for the video  really on point. Think lots of seniors still reluctant to retire because of the points mentioned in your video. And I like this format! Dont know why feels very peaceful haha,btohqsg
Feels you are doing self reflection,btohqsg
I believe that there are people doing DCA consistently for quite a period of time even before September and yet very poor performance,btohqsg
Been DCA-Ing for 5months ale üòÇ now negative üòÇ do I continue DCA-ong & what‚Äôs the time weight return % thing ?,btohqsg
Yeah this series need less effort to film since i dont need to script it or set up the studio setting  so I could share my thoughts more naturally,btohqsg
Okay la  negative $14 hahaha but if core growth portfolio negative a bit weird leh. Thought US and tech doing quite well past few months until sept.,btohqsg
For me everything negative. And i had way more than that guy core growth. My REITs  core  custom all negative. Even if custom using solid ETFs like QQQ everything also negative. Really depressing performance,btohqsg
REITs negative i think i can understand haha  now dont think industrial and retails REITs doing well,btohqsg
Sfye is v red  endowus also red though abit lesser degree... hai.....,btohqsg
It's okay  we all same boat. Tough year (or two),btohqsg
I only have syfe and tiger broker. Syfe 100% portfoilios all negative. And tiger 95% all negative.Can't believe select large cap growth stocks also all red. Syfe etf like QQQ  VTI  RSP also all deep in the red bear market. Unable to recover,btohqsg
I am a beginner in robo investment. Put 70k plus and in 2 mths lost 1k Liao.....,btohqsg
For Endowus.. Capital not guarantee huh?,btohqsg
Oh no... That's hurt. But don't give up hope,btohqsg
The lost is from more from sfye and lesser from endowus...,btohqsg
Hope? Lost faith? Lost trust also. Are these bad stock picks; apple  Microsoft  tsmc  Nvidia  Facebook  amd  Berkshire  MacDonald  home depot.With Such solid stocks still can red? Then im speechless. Is not like I bought meme stocks like amc. Really disappointed,btohqsg
"According to syfe they said need long term to ""ride out voality"". This is what they said to me when I told them about their disastrous portfoilios:HI XXX Investing is a patience game corrections are pack and parcel. Typically investing is a 3-5 year process (at least). History time and again has shown its time in the market and not timing the market that wins. So stay focused with a long run perspective.",btohqsg
If those investing accounts not guarantee  but for those cash smart account is guaranteed with various interest rate if i am not wrong. Better to do research first though!,btohqsg
I keep hearing all this; time in market and diversification. Soundslogical.myportfolio is fully diversified globally and in all sector.. however  100 percent red.... I hope what these guys  say is truthful and not Bec they want the fees ...,btohqsg
Thks XY! Ya.. Better find out first before pump in big,btohqsg
Nothing is guaranteed. My cash smart also lost....,btohqsg
thought cash smart is like bank acc with higher interest rates,btohqsg
Oh.. Then confirm no guarantee lor,btohqsg
Fully 101% agree withLCM. He may just be a stranger to me but that's exactly what happened to my portfolio alsoIn fact I got 12 portfoilios. 2 retis  2 core growth + equity and the rest custom with ETFs with track record. Yet all negative. Diverisifed so much yet still negative. For those who didn't diverisfy  I can't imagine your pain...,btohqsg
sad right  heard some people around my friends bought meme stocks and dogecoin also profit from it. zzz hahaha,btohqsg
Well  at least crypto is green. Like massive green,btohqsg
For me I don't do crypto or meme. I'm a rather risk conscious person. Yet with all these research still entire portfolio red  really depressing. Not sure if it's bad luck or I bought at a high,btohqsg
why need 2 of the portfolios? different risk/weightage?,btohqsg
Wow. I tot because I was too US big tech equity heavy or lacked bonds or other sector . Can't beleive u diverisfy so much more than me yet syfe 100% negative like the bear enclosure in the zoo. Jialat ...,btohqsg
I am kiasu  bought most portfolio and All red..... But will just hang on..... The lesson I learn is diversification does not guaranteed anything too.,btohqsg
Diverisification for the sake of it. But all still negative. Oh well. Not my fault. I may withdraw 100% from syfe and shift to tiger after 6 month free trial. Cos tiger doesn't charge holding fees of 0.65% amonth,btohqsg
If not wait green then buy meh,btohqsg
If its a good biz  it's great discount,btohqsg
hahaha yeah! so continue to DCA ba,btohqsg
"""diversification is a protection against ignorance""~ Warren buffet..Good to have some etf? Or just DCA into a index fund that tracks S&P500 like VOO or SPY? What can possibly go wrong I guess? Or maybe not ..",btohqsg
Haha when green regret red didn't buy more.. red regret green the time buy too much?,btohqsg
Anyway  more experience doesn't mean will be a winner. If u invest just starting in 2020  u will be a super big winner,btohqsg
I don't dare to open my tiger brokers cause I'm just going to assume everything is red everyday. Just let it bleed lo,btohqsg
Hahahh is okayyy there's blood everywhere in the streets,btohqsg
May I ask  what is a good platform to do crypto?,btohqsg
I guess up to personal investing style  i know some people like to jus do ETFs cause dont need to think. Some like to pick individual stocks  some only buy REITs for the dividends,btohqsg
Ya so it's the timing and partly luck. Now the market is over valued. Will have correction downwards. + All the fed nonsense  debt ceiling nonsense  don't drop worse than 2008 happy ale,btohqsg
I have sfye growth  balance  fullreit  reit with bond equity 100 and ALL the new custom portfolio. Non is green.,btohqsg
I do a mix of tried and tested ETF and a mix of individual stock pick. But all negative. Lost faith and trust in investing,btohqsg
LCMwhoaa same as me. I feel both of us can start a YouTube channel to show the truth. We aren't sponsored nor receive massive sponsorship or refferal bonus.,btohqsg
Gemini Singapore is good for major coins. Their fees quite low and they have 10 free withdrawal monthly,btohqsg
But that was last i heard  not sure now got changes or not,btohqsg
Is there a min. capital required for both platform?,btohqsg
Just don't use Binance SG  high fees and cannot trade limit price,btohqsg
Need to trigger active trader first at gemini,btohqsg
nope  no min  both accounts i created with zero dollar,btohqsg
No need. No min comm too,btohqsg

Tell me who wanna invest like that?,btohqsg
show dark side of investing is it hahaha since all the youtubes and media only show positive side,btohqsg
For now I still don't trust crypto. Cos idk how it works. But large cap stocks/etfis so disappointing that makes me tempted to do crypto,btohqsg
Oh my god  you buy more portfolio than me....... So sfye cash plus also negative like endowus....,btohqsg
Well guys  if you cant handle stock market fluctuation  please don't go YOLO crypto. That's even larger,btohqsg
With such diverisification still can all red? Impressive isn't it? Amazing....,btohqsg
Make sure you at least understand the basics of what you are buying first,btohqsg
Ah don't worry I'll withdraw soon so I don't get charged 0.65% a month,btohqsg
cannot handle the up and down,btohqsg
With syfe time doesn't matter one. It's always negative. U can put 1 year 5 year 10 years or until become Skelton  100% still negative.,btohqsg
I diamond hands in tiger for now. Won't sell. Cos I beleive in the fundamentals of my stock pick,btohqsg
Hahah yea I thinking sell syfe buy into stocks,btohqsg
Once you withdraw  you confirm lost... I will stay on since I don't need the fund now though a little disappointed...,btohqsg
"The facts and evidence is 100% red eh. Not about my emotions. Is just not true that what ""15% growth a year equity 100%"".U can see Chris video also.",btohqsg
Once it break even then will shift over to tiger lor. I won't paper loss sell,btohqsg
Unless u have better thing to buy,btohqsg
Yup. Pessimistic outlook. They said September most volalite I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But now october also? Then what's next? Nov  Dec.. Jan  Feb all also most voalite?Not sure how many more apology email letter I'll recieve from syfe,btohqsg
Well  I am not sure if I am right. I will only sell when I need the money or I make profit.. else I will not sell... Any comments??,btohqsg
I only Sell when biz fundamental change or have better investment opportunities else wherre,btohqsg
I think Kelvin learns investing mentioned in his latest videos about not selling your winners and let it roll. Maybe u wanna take a look,btohqsg
Yeaa probably also shld sell some positions get some profits before it falls down again... haizzz,btohqsg
Yeah for me yes  or like Kenny mention  if i dont see it going up and i have other better choices,btohqsg
But I feel currently is just a normal market correction  although it does hurt.. hahah you are not alone,btohqsg
Thank u toLCMfor making me feel less lonely. At least now I know I'm not the only one suffering in depression in syfe. Perhaps we shld think about other platforms to reach out financial goals,btohqsg
Time to bring out this message again,btohqsg

ü§£ It's a good time to cultivate patience and courage :),btohqsg
Nowadays I don't open my syfe or tiger app. Refuse to check. Because I know  go in will see 100% all red... Really impacted mental health very badly,btohqsg
To be fair to Syfe  i think recent few months of also hard to analyse since market is under correction. Maybe if got anyone have longer time with Syfe can share? Or other platforms like Stashaway and Moneyowl?,btohqsg
Not sure how SA and MO is doing,btohqsg
Same case for me... but I will keep DCA monthly into stocksü§£,btohqsg
Maybe only open my tiger APP several times a month,btohqsg
You are not alone...... Hang on...,btohqsg
Yea.. I shldnt have entered the thematic portfolio so quickly haizz,btohqsg
"Stashaway even worse üòÇüòÇüòÇ that's the reason I went with syfe. + I avoided China exposure which is greater exposure in stashway general investing portfoilios.But even with my custom ETFs mainly US equities. Still drop. So I guess China or US don't matter bah. US ""debt ceiling"" = evergrande edition",btohqsg
I also did the same. Run away from SA. But who knows.. Luck is not on my side.Anyway.. Lets be patient and hope the market go back to moon. Hahaha...,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think will recover anytime soon. Just sink further and further in Nov  Dec  2022 and so on,btohqsg
Wow  this thread is becoming a support group for robo investments. üëç,btohqsg
I know it's a tough time for all of us investors but please do not turn this into a self pity support group. Whatever grieve you have with a particular robo  it applies throughout the market and it's not just you. As they say  misery loves company and I don't want to turn this into a negative atmosphere group. So would appreciate if you all cooperate  thanks.,btohqsg
Lucky only my cash+ still positive,btohqsg

Hi@ChrisHMSG  may i ask for Ocbc frank cerdit card  if i were to pay for bus/mrt fare via apple pay  does it consider as mobile transaction? üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
What apps/platform are you all using to track sg stocks/reits?,btohqsg

Does anyone know how to DCA into tiger broker individual stock or ETF? How is that possible when u need to buy 1 unit of that stock at that price?,btohqsg
Every week or month 1 unit,btohqsg
But what if u don't want to buy 1 unit? For example Tesla stock at 780. Maybe I only want 0.5 units a month for example,btohqsg
Then no choice Habe to use syfe through ETF? cos syfe u can control exactly how much to DCA a month,btohqsg
Yea then can't use tiger   I think someone mentioned before interactive broker can buy fraction,btohqsg
u can buy 0.1 share also,btohqsg
Chris  saw your latest video. I must say  very impressive.,btohqsg
You are the man. Or should I say boy. Lol,btohqsg

I never checked as I just executed 2-3 days after applying for permissions. But u can take a look athttps://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/am3/am/settings/tradingpermissions.htm,btohqsg
You will not get anything if you dont hit min $500 x3 months,btohqsg

QQQ vs ARKK what do you all think? which is the better one to invest in?,btohqsg
QQQ for stability and ARK if u wanna risk it,btohqsg
Other good ETFs are SPY  VTI  VOO  also can consider,btohqsg
i think QQQ is quite high risk already no,btohqsg
But it's not as voalite as ARK,btohqsg
im holding vwra as my main err,btohqsg
ARK is actively managed ETF so u need to consider higher expense ratio fees also,btohqsg
Thinking of getting actively managed one now,btohqsg
I'm alr holding vwra  not sure if I wanna dip my hand into vti.,btohqsg
I would be holding 2 etfs from the same manager,btohqsg
What do you guys think of this?,btohqsg
If you want a few etfs haha might as well robo   customise a few etfs in one portfolio,btohqsg
I can choose myself on ibkr eh,btohqsg
Thinking of only getting 2 etfs. Vwra + 1 more like qqq  arkk etc,btohqsg
I'm investing in my joint account with my partner  so going for etfs and not single stocks.,btohqsg
As in I'm using money in my joint account to invest. So I don't wanna go too risky.,btohqsg
For my personal account  I investing in single stocks.,btohqsg
If  i already have VWRA i will go for ARKK for my 2nd one,btohqsg
VWRA and QQQ got a lot overlap holdings,btohqsg
Yup thinking of 90-10 split. Arkk 10% of my etf portfolio,btohqsg
I think 10% I'm willing to invest in such risky etfs haha,btohqsg

Anyone knows if the CPF contribution annual limit of $37 740 inclusive of employer's contributions?,btohqsg
Should be 6 000√ó17√ó (0.2 +0.17),btohqsg
The more detailed calculation should be:Ordinary wage = 12*6000 = $72 000Additional wage = $30 000 (edit)Then 37% of it,btohqsg
Should be 30k if not wrong,btohqsg
Soooo I guess now every month also evergrande?,btohqsg

Is it normal to see deduction of just $0.10 on Amaze card when we use for public transport? Is that how it is supposed to show?,btohqsg
The market already expected it not to pay.,btohqsg
Yes normal for simplygo. But the bigger question is  why are you not using revolut for 20% cashback!,btohqsg
Noted. Will take a look at revolut. Didn't want to have too many diff accounts initiallyüòÇ,btohqsg
Seems like axs don't allow grab mc again?,btohqsg
I never used on AXS though  what were you paying@Kennytkw94,btohqsg
I manage to pay last month,btohqsg
Try asking on the grabpay chat and see if others alsp have the same.problem,btohqsg
Able to use grabpay mc to pay for income tax via axs,btohqsg
Choose credit card  not debit card,btohqsg
Instinctively... I chose debit card for grabmc,btohqsg
Currently I'm paying via giro. If I just cancel the giro   will iras send me a letter to inform me that I have outstanding payments to be made?,btohqsg
You are paying monthly via giro?,btohqsg
If you use axs to pay instead  ahead of the monthly giro deductions  the remaining outstanding will be updated automatically,btohqsg
Haha at first I just set as giro so I don't have to track it,btohqsg
Anyway no grabrewards points if you pay for income tax with grab card,btohqsg
Then after that know of uob absolute topup to grab,btohqsg
So yea haha its still like 1.7% discount?,btohqsg
You pay for insurance also no grabrewards points right?,btohqsg
Anyone heard of the crypto pet game?,btohqsg
At least describe what's the game about instead of just throwing the registration/referral link?,btohqsg
Its a p2p game using usdt on the trc20 network. You will buy pets using usdt and do 5 actions this will increase in the value of your pet increasing 5%. You will be able to sell the pet after 12 hours. You will earn 3% while 2% is taken bu the company. You will only get the proceeds after buying another pet.,btohqsg
To me this is kinda high risk and not alot of information is out there,btohqsg
This^ üòÖ hopefully the slide help,btohqsg
The slides literally states what i summarized.,btohqsg
More in-depth brief on how it works and how to play,btohqsg
If u have any questionson on how to play or get started feel free to drop me a pm. Will help to guide u,btohqsg
If you guys are comfortable in using USDT  can go ahead but im staying out. Also just a heads up to those interested  only put in what you can afford to lose.,btohqsg
The only DD you guys can do on this game is the slides he just shared. Information is not really available online.,btohqsg
Quite suprised by my YouTube community results so want to see if any difference here,btohqsg
Hi im curious and new to REITS investments. What are the better platforms to use to invest in reits? Thank you!!,btohqsg
You can refer to this video. I use interactive brokers personallyhttps://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg
Since the limiting factor for withdrawing early is the tax  if you can earn more than the 5% tax penalty while invested in SRS  would you cash out and invest outside maybe in 5-10 years?So you benefit from tax relief and don‚Äôt lose the cash flow you invested in earlier which you can then use for other purposes,btohqsg
Not for me beause the purpose is to defer till age 62  for 50% tax charged. And also at that age when u have almost no income the tax bracket will favor you.Secondly  you would want your investments to grow over time instead of taking them out pre maturely. Unless you have exhausted your cash and cash equivalents   I don't see a major need to withdraw SRS,btohqsg
Okay icic thanksBtw how did you determine the amount to be invested? Based on percentage on your portfolio or just the maximum limit allowable? What were some considerations if you don‚Äôt mind sharing haha,btohqsg
I started everything from a tax saving perspective  because I hate paying tax.So with CPF VCMA and RSTU SA  those formed my foundation first to reduce my tax assessable income. Since it has 4% interest too.Once my CPF is near max and cannot top up anymore  then I look at SRS to save tax  which Endowus and MoneyOwl come just in time with their low cost options.Ultimately  you may want to reduce your tax assessable income to a level that you don't mind paying tax to IRAS.,btohqsg

anyone here affected by ohm / iswitch closure? what's your plan?,btohqsg
im bummed that ohm exited. their customer service was super.,btohqsg
are you guys affected by the closures moving to SP to monitor first? singtel-tuas power seems aggressive. offering 22.18c for 12 month fixed  compared to the current SP tariff of 25.8c for Q4 2021.,btohqsg
Yeah this energy market thing  just go for the most cost effective plan  better if they own their power plants. Tuas power is one,btohqsg
And look out for credit card promo discounts,btohqsg
Hello  just wondering if there are other ways of paying insurance with credit cards? I used the UOB absolute > grab card one. But there‚Äôs the cap of 10k monthly.,btohqsg
Like Senoko power has $100 off Maybank/hsbc card too#notaffiliated,btohqsg
How much is your bill that $10k is not enough? Or you can get your partner or family member to get a grabpay card too,btohqsg
yup im just thinking how long will it go  the tariff rise. if i get the 36 mth plan at 22.5c  that's 12 quarters of hoping the tariff dont drop too far below 22.5c..,btohqsg
everyone else now is around 25c  some even higher than the SP tariff.,btohqsg
This is beyond my spend capability.,btohqsg
It's always a gamble isn't it. But if you look at absolute terms. How much savings/cost are we talking about.For every 200 kwh monthly usage  a difference of 2c per kwh is only $4 monthly,btohqsg
Just drink 1 less bubble tea,btohqsg
was speaking to my dad about this,btohqsg
he said let it automatically move to SP,btohqsg
amt of savings is not that great,btohqsg
did we not see this comign tho? iswitch and ohm exiting last week  union taking away some of its heavy usage clients and focussing on residential.,btohqsg
the perks they gave was really too good to be true,btohqsg
for us  obviously  we just enjoy lol.,btohqsg
i was on 18.6c. compared to 25.8c now at SP. before ohm collapsed.,btohqsg

Hi all  do you know what are the benefits when you get to Grab Platinum with the UOB Absolute card? I remember seeing 1% rebate or something from Grab?,btohqsg
You will get to Platinum tier by spending in Grab  regardless of whether you use Uob Absolute. The reward value is 1.2%,btohqsg
So how will they rebate me with 1.2% by giving me cash? Or everything that I spend will have a 1.2% deduction?,btohqsg
Use grabpoints to redeem stuff$1 spent = 6 Grab points500 pts = $1 reward,btohqsg
so that is what it means by 1.2%? ü§£,btohqsg
Ya  u just use 6/500 thats 1.2% for every $1 u spent,btohqsg
6/500 meaning? Don't know what to redeem leh. Only like can redeem food or what,btohqsg
Btw you look very handsome on YouTube,btohqsg
Thanks but don't idolize me yet  I'm not an influencer üòÇ,btohqsg
Just realise GrabPay can be linked to my Qatar member portal. Shiok!,btohqsg
In my opinion for UOB absolute to Grabpay method  it really depends on how much u value the grab points u will earn and use. For me personally  grab points rewards are not attractive for me hence i went for cashback from my card itself. Just my opinion üôèüèΩ,btohqsg

Syfe: 1.5% cash+ portfolio!!!Rest: really lying all the way...Not to mention extremely dismal and poor performance in retis and core ü§¢,btohqsg
Hi Christopher  may I know why don't you buy the ETF through IBKR instead of through Sfye?,btohqsg
For DCA $500  the transaction cost on IBKR is not worth it  especially LSE,btohqsg
Hi Chris  can I ask if you transfer the funds between syfe portfolio or withdraw out then deposit the funds in?,btohqsg
It's just a personal preference  no good reason behind it,btohqsg
I think if transfer between portfolio will not go through currency changes,btohqsg
Good point but too late anyway haha,btohqsg
Like I mentioned before  Syfe is good for the small amount investors who may want to DCA weekly to manage risk. You can do like $50 weekly instead of $200 monthly so the DCA is more smoothened out. Nothing right or wrong  just different strategy based on your own preference,btohqsg
How about for lump sum investors? Not suitable. I've put for a few months alr all negative portfoilio everything negative not a single positive return on core and retis,btohqsg
I think everyone agrees their core and retis abit questionable of their so called claims,btohqsg
Lump sum is always better to go via IBKR. One time cheap fee only,btohqsg
How much is their fees ?,btohqsg
It's Kenna ridiculous to be paying 0.65% on top of expense ratio for holding specific etf in syfe  that's why I went with tiger in the end,btohqsg
I'm still on contemplating whether to fully withdrawn by core and retis portfoilio,btohqsg
Idk. I don't use Ikbr as the app is terrible to use and the UI is ü§¢,btohqsg
Ibkr tiered is $0.35 per ticker,btohqsg
Robos are merely tuned to those that are lazy to do research or have no time on hand to invest. Some people are willing to pay that 0.65% for that.,btohqsg
I did my research and my portfolio still dismal performance. Perhaps my portfolio sucks real bad consisting of poor companies like apple  Microsoft  N really lousy etf like VOO  SPY  VTI. bad research perhaps,btohqsg
In fact my returns from syfe was the same as what they claimed,btohqsg
We had a small correction in this 2 months so decrease in portfolio is not surprising,btohqsg
if you buy the same etfs in syfe in other brokers  your returns will be the same,btohqsg
It's essentially the same instrument. Just bad timing,btohqsg
Really? 15% a year for equity 100?,btohqsg
My portfolio is more like -5%. Is not even true,btohqsg
Yup. Only corrected after I started investing. But before I started bull run all the way,btohqsg
yep so bad timing for you dont blame the platform for bad returns üòâ,btohqsg
Yup so for those who started in sep 2021 can never match and never catch up with the rest right ?,btohqsg
Then is btr to withdraw the entire portfolio since everytime such bad timing then,btohqsg
Ah don't worry  I'm hoarding cash now. More than 50K. Next year will wait till end of September 2022 then I'll lump sum in after the market corrected,btohqsg
Stay invested   time in the market. Wins timing the market,btohqsg
So what if after 3 years still entire portfolio red? Proven time in market doesn't win timing the market ?,btohqsg
doing this might lead you to miss out some of the best days in the market,btohqsg
you might even potentially lose a chance at a 20% gain in the next year,btohqsg
But u said timing mah  so since September is always the worst month  I'll just hoard and lump sum in October 2022  after all the crashing like this year,btohqsg
to each his own but you will be buying at a much higher price if you want till then,btohqsg
Nope. The price in end September 2022 will crash so so low till it's even lower than now. So it's bte to lump sum in then,btohqsg
Taking into account all the inflation and tapering nonsense.,btohqsg
you have a crystal ball? how will you know Sep 2022 will be lower then current prices,btohqsg
Not me. Motley Fool themselves Stated. It's proven by facts that September is the worst month. So just hoard cash and dump in 100% everything in 1 Oct 2022. Problem settled,btohqsg
No point to talk about this. No one has crystal ball. Who is right  no one knows. Just take responsibility of your own actions and be accountable for it. Moat importantly  don't blame someone else for your own shortcomings,btohqsg
So why not just invest in october and cash it out in August 2022? that way you avoid september,btohqsg
When investing  there's always risk. Before investing need to accept the potential of losing money. If you withdraw when 5 percent negative.. if afterwards it increases 10 percent back.. how ? Syfe doesn't control the market. It is also proven that one who dca always wins . Isn't it?,btohqsg
Syfe doesn't control the market but it controls the components within the portfoilio . I.e. retis  core  custom. So it has been dismal performance even for those who DCA,btohqsg
If market on the whole went down. It might have been worse of for those who bought individual stocks. Hence syfe may have alrdy done it best to minimise loss,btohqsg
Just curious  anyone of you use my AMEX BTC link for sign up? And got the BTC gift in Gemini?,btohqsg

how does this works? don't quite understand,btohqsg
Your credit cards that earn miles or reward points for miles conversion  then go through bank rewards portal to redeem miles,btohqsg
Like DBS WWMC  Altitude  UOB PPV  HSBC Revolution  OCBC 90N  Citi Rewards  PremierMiles,btohqsg
oh ok so if I spend enough for 50k miles then I get 15 percent bonus miles?,btohqsg
E.g. you earn 10x points (4 mpd) on Citi rewards.You will need $2500 eligible spend to hit the 10 000 miles redemption.Then SIA gives you another 15% bonus during this promo period,btohqsg

Is Gemini rate ok for trading or which exchange is better?,btohqsg
can consider kucoin exchange. but if u want to buy usdt from sg seller then have to set up huobi.,btohqsg
Trading FeesKuCoin has extremely low trading fees starting at just 0.1%  and you can receive a 20% discount if you pay fees with KCS coin (Kucoin's token). This reduces the trade fee to only 0.08% per trade,btohqsg

Usd75 fees if withdrawal less than usd10k?,btohqsg
Yeah  either withdraw more than $10k  or transfer to Gemini then use their withdrawal,btohqsg
the 5 % off will last for how long,btohqsg
So withdraw more than usd 10k  no fees?,btohqsg
So transfer sgd or usd to ftx ?,btohqsg
Always USD for crypto. The spreads for SGD are ridiculous,btohqsg
Dbs remit USD is free but around 0.6% spread from spot rate doing SGD to USD conversion,btohqsg
To work around that I use IBKR transfer USD into DBS MCA  $10 Sgd fee still worth it due to the better ratea,btohqsg
10 sgd is fixed regardless the amount?,btohqsg
USD inbound transfers to DBS MCA,btohqsg
the 5% off fee is forever? Is there a fixed period for new users?,btohqsg
Sgd10 charged by ibkr or dbs?,btohqsg
I think i just do video on this better  answer all the questions,btohqsg
Hmmm  but futu transfer to dbs no fees correct,btohqsg
Yes but futu has 0.3% fx spread,btohqsg
So up to you compare between the spread vs $10 sgd which damage is higher,btohqsg
Chris  your new BTO videos can highlight this...,btohqsg

Hello  everyone. Nice to meet you.,btohqsg
Have anyone watched the Cafe money ep34 on cash flow on YouTube.There are a few key takeaway from the video.Benny [one of the host] mention that there is this tactics known as 2 percent interest apr balance transfer. Want to know how does it work?he mentioned that open a private limited company to get loans. I understood it need to be operational. But how do make it less effort while able to maximise the loan. And does this work with property as well? He only mention briefly without on how to do it.Hopefully someone can chat more about this and we learn together.,btohqsg
I can talk about the first one. Many ways about it woth financial institutions. But I talk about using IBKR to borrow margin.Ibkr us charges 1.56% interest on margin. So if you withdraw cash on margin against your investment portfolio collateral  you dont have to sell your stocks and they can still grow  while you withdraw at 1.56% rate,btohqsg
For IBKR SG  the rate is 2.56% pa so less attractive. But in the grand scheme of things  a 2.56% interest rate is not too shabby either when using for non housing loans,btohqsg
Anyway i hope everyone is doing well in your portfolios especially this week! Big tech are leading the gains (less FB),btohqsg
Thanks Marc  let me digest this news abit and gather some opinions online while i script it,btohqsg
The method is saying is using the balance of margin account. Didn't think of that. Thank you very much. Anyone else have the idea on credit card balance transfer?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone using the Revolut app or card? May I know how to use it and for what purpose or how to maximize it? Appreciate it!,btohqsg
Currently I think the instarem have the best deal. Same with zero foreign transaction fee,btohqsg
Good for public transport 20% cashback,btohqsg
revolut card 3 x $10 transaction need to be within how many days ah?,btohqsg
Within the promotion period  usually 20 days,btohqsg
Hey chris  do you have a video on best miles card? Been researching and no conclusion yet,btohqsg
I am filming one this weekend  but will release few weeks later.Meanwhile  look at my Citi and DBS card video for these two strong miles cardDBS WWMCCITI Rewards,btohqsg
Can Gemini use xfers for deposit?,btohqsg
Not sure  i just remit USD via dbs remit,btohqsg
U mean use fast transfer from dbs to Gemini?,btohqsg
It's a US bank account  FAST only works for local banks,btohqsg
What will you do to your moneyowl dimensional fund after 31 Dec? Their first 10k free mgmt fee will end by then right?,btohqsg
I have a feeling MoneyOwl will extend the promo. Because once they stop this there is no competitive advantage over Endowus anymoee,btohqsg
But if they don't  then i have content to make again,btohqsg
Hi just to check if u invest your srs account do u create a different goal in Endowus or u add the srs fund to your core investment?,btohqsg
I created a different goal  since I am buying different funds as well,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGhow do we differentiate between ""advice"" and fear mongering",btohqsg
The media does not earn money from their stock picks. They earn money from attention  from clicks  from ad revenue  from scandals  from contraversy. Therefore  their interest is always to create content and titles that make you click,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGI remembered that these are some ""top wall Street analysis"" that said October will crash cos of ""black swan"" event. End up October was one of the best rebounds. I held through and paid off big time",btohqsg
Do your own homework  read the financial statements  read what bears say about the company/stock  do they make sense,btohqsg
Always consume from opposite viewpoints and then make your stand,btohqsg
Yup I did. The stuff and etf and I invest in is fundamentally good basics. Ex: FAANG  big tech  well established ETFs like SPY  VOO  VTI. can't possibly go wrong mah,btohqsg
Yeah i hope u didnt sell off your stockpicks despite Sep being a really bearish month,btohqsg
I didn't. It paid off big time in October  portfoilio has multiple real green day's. I guess being a new investor  this taught me how to increase my diamond hands and beleive that my portfolio is well diverisifed and well researched,btohqsg
It is ok to sell off losers and add to winner  but not the other way round,btohqsg
I didn't really sell but I ** rebalanced. Less syfe and more specific stock and etf on tiger that's all. I'm still thinking whether to let go of my syfe core and retis once and for all,btohqsg
Treat those loser stocks with low conviction like your cash pile. Everytime you feel like adding a winner stock during correction but no cash  just sell your loser stocks. Give u more peace of mind also,btohqsg
The only loser stock I have in my portfolio is Meta platforms (aka Facebook) which it got destoryed and never recovered since September... Other than that portfoilio is actually quite green :),btohqsg
FB or MVRS is still fundamentally a good business though I don't like to use their product,btohqsg
Other than that... My stocks like Nvidia  Microsoft  VOO  QQQ  VUG  VGT  all rallied strong in October.. portfolio PnL in good green now,btohqsg
I'll hold MVRS for a while more and when I break even I'll think whether to get an S&P500 ETF or continue to risk and hold it if there are more investigations again . This MVRS very noisy stock,btohqsg
Hi. Ive a newbie qn. If i editor cancel the stocks bought on moomoo will there be another trade fee incurred on top of it?,btohqsg
If the trade was not executed  then no fees will be charged,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGis this noise or real news again? Tax on captial gains in liquid assets. This guy says the whole world will crash this week,btohqsg
This is unrealized capital gains tax. To administer it is a great headache  Don't even mention the execution,btohqsg
Hi ChrisWhat is your thoughts on Fullerton MoneyOwl WiseIncome?,btohqsg
I repost the msg.Have anyone watched the Cafe money ep34 on cash flow on YouTube.There are a few key takeaway from the video.Benny [one of the host] mention that there is this tactics known as 2 percent interest apr balance transfer.

Hey guys  the 1% cashback from Instarem,btohqsg
Where does it go to and how can we use it,btohqsg
Can we use it to offset future card transactions?,btohqsg
Or is it just to use for overseas fund transfer?,btohqsg
Will go to Amaze wallet (under Link card for payment),btohqsg
Use it to top up Grab then wothdraw,btohqsg
So have to link grab mc?,btohqsg
Or just use it to top up grab directly,btohqsg
Change your card linkage in amaze to amaze wallet  then use amaze card to top up grab,btohqsg
I'm waiting till tomorrow to see what November promo instarem comes out with  if any.,btohqsg
U mean when using amaze card. Use the amaze app to change the linkage to amaze wallet. Don't quite get it.,btohqsg
I think you just explained it in the first sentence,btohqsg
Do you mean using the cashback amount to topup grab?,btohqsg
OK. Think I confused earlier on. Now get it,btohqsg

Of course I didn't. I'm diamond hands not paper hands.,btohqsg
Those who said the fed tapering will cause massive crash  how come last night so green ah? Wonder why,btohqsg
He not very good at managing finance. Bankrupted before Probably good at invading taxes and lying about the stories.,btohqsg
No one knew when it will crash.,btohqsg
I thought you almost wanted to paper,btohqsg
No ah Zuckerberg meta platform tested My diamond hands drop 15% but I still didn't paper. I beleive my portfolio is well diverisifed with good foundations. These few days up like printing money,btohqsg

But ftx need to stake ftt correct?,btohqsg
No need. But if you stake then it's free trade,btohqsg
How much u need to stake before u can get free trade?,btohqsg

Hi Chris  have you done a vlog on FTX? Is there one you could recommend. I‚Äôm abit unclear on depositing and withdrawing fiat and other Cypto in FTX Wallet for purchasing/selling  crypto on the FTX platform (eg.  Are there any withdrawal fees for S$ back to my bank account?) TIA,btohqsg
Will have a video on this coming up on the best way to fund ftx/gemini,btohqsg
But if you mean step by step process  can check out Kelvi learns investing. I think he did a video on this already,btohqsg
This message needs to be spread,btohqsg
let's set the record straight hereFTX Pro appis the mobile version of FTX Exchange (FTX.com)- this is good for trading due to the ability to do limit buy/sell amidst other features- you get to do free withdrawals for BTC and should you stake FTT  free withdrawals for ERC tooFTX app (formerly BlockFolio)is a mobile-only app- it's good for free withdrawalsYou can transfer between the two platforms without feesBoth apps require separate registration but same KYCThink of it as One Country  Two Systems,btohqsg
My crypto guru@wilflareis here. Please direct your questions to him,btohqsg
Hi Wil For new investors into crypto and who prefer to buy and hold eg. USDC  and deposit into Hodlnaut to earn interest Which crypto exchange platform would you recommend?,btohqsg
FTX is the way forward for now (:,btohqsg
I think@ChrisHMSGprobably has a ref forFTX.comcan use his!,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply.What is the recommended min. Amount to try out the platform considering the fees involve?,btohqsg
Ftx has no min commission unlike stock brokers. They charge a small 0.02% fees per trade,btohqsg
So don't worry about the min amount,btohqsg
Thanks Chris.I read from FTX:There are also no blockchain withdrawal fees except for ETH  ERC-20 tokens  or small BTC withdrawals.  FTX users will pay the blockchain fees for all ETH  ERC20 tokens unless they have FTT stakedI realized Holdnaut uses ERC20 Network  any idea what's the charges by FTX?,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGChris what do u think of syfe keep posting sponsored content on their Instagram to promote untruths about how ""great"" their platform is? Their syfe core with China exposure tanked big time and retis performance has been dismal ü§¢",btohqsg

Hi  i try to withdraw usdt from FTX pro (using chris ref)  but stop at the 10usdt fee,btohqsg

Yes  this method works as well. Must ask Wil to forward his step by step template message again,btohqsg
is i never read and follow his steps carefully. Really thanks for sharing üôè,btohqsg
I thought there's diff networks to choose for the transfer of usdt? As long as not using the erc20 is free for ftx  if I'm not wrong,btohqsg

Morning Chris  regards Hodlnaut  would like to know more and hope you could give some guidance  like how much and how long to stay invested with them  also which are the better ways to avoid extra fees for withdrawing from exchanges and Hodlnaut  thanks a lot. BK,btohqsg
How much is very subjective to how comfortable you are putting crypto in an unsecured lending platform. For me the number is around $10K USD.How long to stay invested  i hope they last forever since it's a HODL platform.For avoiding fees  Btc transfer from FTX is free. For other coins  use the FTX Pro -> FTX Blockfolio -> Hodlnaut for no fees transfer.Can look at what was discussed here yesterday. And our in-house crypto guru Wil will be here to assist,btohqsg

i tink it depends on your goals and objectives. Crypto can be for passive income  trading  growth   or just preserve money (against inflation)   etc .,btohqsg
Thanks. Not sure which exchanges is the easiest to start with for newbie.,btohqsg
I feel  easy exchange usually comes with higher fees.,btohqsg
Will be releasing a crypto exchange video tonight 8pm,btohqsg
That is true. Likewise for stock brokers,btohqsg
the difficult part is the fiat to cryptos,btohqsg
the SGD pairings limited for most exchange,btohqsg
each exchange has their pros and cons  so i use quite a few  make use of the pros and avoid the cons .,btohqsg
coinhako is the easiest to buy with SGD   but fee highest. and not all coins able to allow u to transfer to other exchange platforms,btohqsg
Removed your referral code. You can pmH Tdirectly,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the best broker platform to do options? Is it tiger or IKBR?,btohqsg
What's TDA? means tiger not ideal to do options?,btohqsg
Tiger not ideal especially when you are trading spread options,btohqsg
something to do with the margin calculation which I also don't really understand,btohqsg
How about for newbie just starting to learn options ?,btohqsg
should be TDA/IBKR  these two more common I think,btohqsg
Sit through the 3 hour long Options training for beginner video on youtube. I know it's really long but  really it's worth your time and you don't need to find high and low for other information,btohqsg
haha can do a video on ibkr,btohqsg
I've been watching Kevin learns investing but I really don't even understand 10% of what he says. What covered call cash covered put hear already going to collaspe,btohqsg
Thats why i say watch the 3 hr video. It will be crystal clear,btohqsg
remember to do paper trade first.,btohqsg
is cgs using the same options methods?,btohqsg
Lacking motivation and no incentive lolll,btohqsg
Is doing options really a must? How about just longing the stock for capital gains? More simplier that way and don't have to monitor the options until go mentally insane,btohqsg
Take a look at another youtuber Ziet invests. He does a lot of videos on Ibkr  nice guy too,btohqsg
haha whats the current promo ah?,btohqsg
Every $100 u put in Ibkr  u get $1 worth of IBKR shares,btohqsg
wow   haah up to how much,btohqsg
But need 100 shares to do options right,btohqsg
Isn't options = like shorting or day trading alr???,btohqsg
No and no. Trust me I watched CGS and Kelvins video i still dont understand options fully until i watch the 3 hour video,btohqsg
are they using same type of options strategy?,btohqsg
I've seen those wall Street bets YOLO ppl do what naked option or very close to expiration date then what 150K become 4M. Got so easy?,btohqsg
can share the 3 hrs video? or do a 20 mins video to summarise hahahah,btohqsg
This is the 3 hour option video@Kennytkw94,btohqsg
Just block 3 hour of your time. Throw away your mobile phone and focus. You will save more time instead of searching for other sources,btohqsg
haha what he covers is all the types of options already ah?,btohqsg
Is there a less risky way to do options first? Like with 1 share. Why need 100 ah. Feels like a bomb that going to Xplode,btohqsg
Yes  it's called paper trading. Just try out,btohqsg
Yes all the basics sell put  sell call  buy put  buy call,btohqsg
For those who missed the poll,btohqsg
it has gotten a lot better to be honest. compared to 2017,btohqsg
and it's really not advisable to do SGD for crypto for two main reasons:(1) SGD trade pairs are limited(2) even if available  SGD trade pair trading volume is comparatively lower so you may or may not suffer a poor spread (though Coinhako is decent),btohqsg
"on Coinhakopersonally  I'm not a fan of the Coinhako platform for multiple reasons:(1) High trading fees: at 0.75%  they are pretty much the highest fee exchange. arguably high fees can be mitigated by other ""features"" but that's not the case here because:(2) High crypto withdrawal fees: I can't remember offhand how Coinhako charges withdrawal fees but it's not the best(3) Fees for fiat deposit + withdrawals: They charge a percentage - which simply doesn't make sense when users have so many other options these days(4) Limited withdrawal network support: You may see a lot of SGD trade pairs on Coinhako but you need to consider whether you get the coins off the exchange for staking  DeFi  etc. (where the fun is at)- Unfortunately  Coinhako support in this regard is super limited and left wanting---Coinhako must be acknowledged for their pioneering efforts in the Singapore scene (they've been around since 2014) but given the abundance of options  I see little reason to stay with Coinhako and many more reasons to explore other platformsBut then again  every thing boils down to one's personal optimum amount of hassle. If Coinhako meets that for you  then perhaps it's fine too",btohqsg
Maybe you want to change your title of the video. Shld be best way to change your currency,btohqsg
1. The title is fine2. It is about which exchange is preferred first. The funding is almost the same for other platforms,btohqsg
Unable to pay via credit card  is it only for us credit cards?,btohqsg
Depends on exchange. If they only accept USD  then yes only US credit cards,btohqsg
Has anybody compared Gemini Earn Vs Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
hmm if you're comparing the supported coins on Hodlnaut vs Gemini Earn- then Hodlnaut rates are definitely higher----but comparing risks  how they do it  etc.: different thingswhat are you looking at?,btohqsg
no specific topic actually  just general overview,btohqsg
I tried to sign up for options trading in IBKR but failed.,btohqsg
So no pt watching what 3hr option trading video since access denied,btohqsg
Or u can watch the video  then complete the options teaching exam,btohqsg
the point of watching the video is to get some basic knowledge on options,btohqsg
"I've promoted@boontee86to Stocks guru of this group. Check out his YouTube channel ""Invest with Boon Tee"" as well. He creates content around stock market investing and have really good insights",btohqsg
So@wilflarewhen are you creating your blog or youtube channel?,btohqsg
Can just take the options exam  i think the exams can redo multiple times,btohqsg
agreed! ü•≤  i blindly gotten some alt coins previously from coinhako only when try to withdraw for staking then realize that withdrawal is not supported,btohqsg
been thinking about it - got most things set -up but no time,btohqsg
hello Christopher  have you heard of CardUp before?,btohqsg
CardUp is pretty useful to earn miles and cashback on insurance  rental  etc. and more,btohqsg
Yes  but im not using (yet),btohqsg
incur 2.25% processing fee for expenses that usually cannot earn miles,btohqsg
i started to trade options 4 months agoOnce got the concept right  it is quite interesting (but gotta to proper risk management).happy to learn from the community here .,btohqsg
Awesome  which ticker do you look at?,btohqsg
For those who feel IBKR Pro app is too complicated  they launched a simpler app called IBKR Impact  much less features but UI is more friendly,btohqsg
Hopefully one day will have a tutorial on ikbr hahahh,btohqsg
I think folks usually wait for promo codes that will bring the overall fee down to 1.5 to 1.7%,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhat‚Äôs with all these overbought over heating news. They said the same thing 6 months and 9 months ago and S&P500 still continue to raise what,btohqsg
Don't have to keep asking me. I don't know and have no crystal ball,btohqsg
It rly depends on his mood .,btohqsg
Hi all  need some opinions please. I recently chanced upon tbe Crypto cards fromcrypto.comwith the entry level cards already giving 2% cashback. Question is  is that a better cashback card than than the ones issued by banks?,btohqsg
uob amex absolute cashback. Or upgrade crypto card to jade green. Just if you willing to expose yrself with crypto.,btohqsg
On a side note. Huobi is exiting SG market. So for those with cryptos in Huobi  do transfer them out soon  either FTX  Gemini or Hodlnaut,btohqsg
not the most optimal :3best way is to useUOB Absolute or AMEX TCB to topup GrabPayGrabPay topup RevolutRevolut top-up CDC card (:so before you even start spending with the CDC card  you already have a 1.5% to 1.7% cashback at hand,btohqsg
but if you have specialised credit cards like a high Cashback card or high miles earning card then those might still be betterCDC CROback is only worthwhile when(1) the transaction doesn't earn anything on other cards(2) It's a big transaction that would exceed the bonus rates on other cards,btohqsg
U mean use credit card to buy crypto?,btohqsg
Use credit card to topup card?,btohqsg
The first question you should ask is if Gemini is safe. Because Earn is just a feature of it,btohqsg
crypto.comvisa card is a debit card. need to top up first,btohqsg
So it is actually use debit card. Hahaha,btohqsg
Why market crashed last night ? Entire portfolio got sunk,btohqsg
Market crashed? S&P500 only dropped 0.82%,btohqsg
Last night considered okay for me already. Previous night was worse. Give the market a break from the Oct rally,btohqsg
Usually the poll results from our TG group is a good sample of what we will see in the YouTube community poll. It will be interesting to see how results turn out over there in YouTube community page when I publish it after,btohqsg

Yes  will have a video on this,btohqsg
Oh ok. How to get the 0.25% fees? As for my trade  it is 0.35%.,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows if you'll still be eligible for Citi Card's Welcome Promo if you sign up via SingSaver or MoneySmart?,btohqsg
Had use activetrader limit buy order but fees is 0.35%.,btohqsg
Ya. Maybe is time to review yr portfolio. Tank a bit also cannot endure. Look what happened on real crash 2000. 2008. 2020. That is crash.....,btohqsg
Hi anyone transferred to FTX‚Äôs routing number instead of bank account number,btohqsg
Is it because you followed Kelvin's FTX video?,btohqsg
Don't worry about it  he posted that he got his money back,btohqsg

so many rich ppl in SG,btohqsg
Well your question is about whether it is so easy to be millionaire. my answer is yes if you have the luck.,btohqsg
Thanks for your video on Miles Credit Card. Is getting miles in general more value per spending as compared to cash rebates?,btohqsg
it depends on your personal valuation of each mileand whether you aim to accumulate enough to redeem business or first class flightsif first class or business  each mile is worth 2 centsa 4 miles per dollar credit card would grant you 8 cents per dollar spending  that's a 8% rebate.in that context  it beats cash rebates,btohqsg
The thought process is:Do you want to fly first/business class flight?Yes: Do not use cash to buy  it's expensive. Accumulate miles using credit cards if your normal spending can achieve it (>$1000 monthly)No: don't touch miles card at all,btohqsg
And don't use miles to redeem economy flights. Most of the time it doesn't make sense (apart from some routes),btohqsg
Thanks! Miles cannot be used to get economy seats.?,btohqsg
miles can be used for any flight. more miles needed for higher cat of seats,btohqsg
what chris is saying is that the disparity in price based on cash terms between business and econ is so big that if you have accumulated miles to redeem a biz class ticket you should use miles instead of cash. correct me if im wrong  chris.,btohqsg
miles can be used to get Economy Class but the effort/reward ratio doesn't make sense there,btohqsg
and also ask per what Wil says above.,btohqsg
on a more reflective note while we can frown upon such generational wealth being made overnight  I think we need to give credit where credit is due:(1) younger folks have a much longer time horizon (Warren Buffett for example won't be big on BTC simply because the man doesn't have the time horizon to wait it out as someone aged 20 would)(2) younger folks have a different risk profile (they don't have the commitments that most working adults we do and that allows them to invest  whether we feel it's responsible or not is a separate question)- they grow up with different exposure- personally  I applaud that risk taking because even amongst their peers  they are the exception  not the norm.on a more balanced note(a) survivorship bias - for every young person that makes it  there are many others who got burnt(b) confirmation bias - these are exception  not the norm,btohqsg
we may say that money that comes easy is lost easyI think one of the smartlocal stories shared that perspective too- but that is a phase  a part of the journey that most of us go thru too (getting our first 4 digit paycheque  we feel rich  we spend)but I think there's a silver lining. precisely because they are exposed to wealth early and how easily it is lost- they start the process of proper financial planning  financial literacy much much earlier,btohqsg
Yup  rather than saying they are lucky  I would say they have the guts to take risk and are now rewarded. Given the same situation  I may not have takent the risk at all.,btohqsg
"Haha can add one more option. ""I can't top up SA anymore""",btohqsg
Sir  you have done well ‚úÖI will reach there next year!,btohqsg
Removed due to out of topic,btohqsg
Does anyone know if a employee can topup their CPF to Max $17740 for the year to enjoy the max income tax relief? Or this topup is only for self employed person?,btohqsg
You can voluntary contribute to your MA up to $37 740 CPF contribution limit for 2021. VCMA is eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
So lets say you earned total $50 000 annual income. 37% of it will be $18 500. You have a gap of $19 240 to contribute MA for tax relief  assuming your MA has not reached BHS,btohqsg
Next year will be different though  I will talk about it tonight,btohqsg
So can only contribute to MA  not OA?,btohqsg
You can't specifically contribute OA only. Can only VC to all 3 Accounts and that has no tax relief,btohqsg
Thanks. That was the key point I wanted to find out. No benefit for employee to topup if no tax relief.,btohqsg
Another question and this is on SRS. What will happen to stocks purchased using SRS after age 62?,btohqsg
Is it worth topping up kids Medisave account? If yes  what‚Äôs the max amount one should top-up?,btohqsg
U can continue to contribute and invest after 62 as long as you haven't started your withdrawal cycle. Once you start withdrawing then you cant invest/contribute anymore,btohqsg
This is highly subjective to individual but I won't do it. Rather top up your parents CPF for tax relief,btohqsg
That's not what I am asking. Let's say you have 10 000 DBS shares purchased over the years before age 62. Would you need to withdraw the shares? What happen if you sell off the shares before or after the 10 year withdrawal period?,btohqsg
This was answered in my SRS video,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks! I will view it. üòÅ,btohqsg
Couldnt find the answer...:-( I think I didn't make myself clear. Do I have to sell my shares and withdraw the cash I liquidated from shares? Yes right? :-),btohqsg
Short answer  is no need to sell can transfer outThanks@boontee86,btohqsg
Anyway you have a unique situation as most people can't wait to take it out at 62,btohqsg
We're sharing same thing üëçüèªYou're welcomeStanleyüôèüèª,btohqsg
Not unique lah. Just trying to see how to plan how to make full use of the tax free withdrawals after 62. I probably would sell and withdrawal those non-dividend stocks instead of transferring out.,btohqsg
Yes  more important to plan your own strategy that works well for you towards retirement planning!,btohqsg
But hor  I suspect there would be a fee for transferring SRS stocks to CDP. Anybody know?,btohqsg
This guy said in Jan 2021 that crash is impeding. Sell all now. So we are at November 2021 and...?,btohqsg
I think just watching Bloomberg is not enough,btohqsg
try this one  1 hour podcast then you will better understand his perspective,btohqsg
I might not recall correctly  but I remember his bubble comment is not to the general market. He was commenting on pocket of bubbles especially on the SPAC. One company he mentioned was QuantumScape (which he invested since pre-IPO)  but the valuation was just crazy early of the year,btohqsg
QS dropped since beginning of this year,btohqsg
Bloomberg/CNBC like to pick small part of interview and make their own stories. It will much more sensational by referring to entire market,btohqsg
So usually they like to write sensational headlines like what will crash next week pls sell all now cos they want ppl to lose out or so they can buy the dip?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/HNBqS4yaRVMEven ppl like him trying to hoard cash to buy the dip in anticipation of market crash,btohqsg
"in general all news that describe ""market may crash soon"" will attract views  so news agency has tendency to show these",btohqsg
but the interview video that you shared is quite long also  so this one also worth watching  thanks for sharing,btohqsg
i will be more cautious on those 3-5 minutes video (especially coming from CNBC) because they tend to pick the most sensational part to show,btohqsg
time in the market is better than timing the market,btohqsg
Everyone diff strategy.. his may not be the same anymore. He isn't that young now .,btohqsg
Buffett's cash pile question was raised during annual shareholder meeting- Cash on hand 15% of values of BRK businesses- Back the insurance liabilities including catastrophic event- Market valuation is high  so Buffett hesitant to deploy- He is okay to buyback BRK shares  but if price too high then he will not do it,btohqsg
I hope Chris can talk more about reitüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Passive income and low risk better put the money in Fixed deposit,btohqsg
Thanks for the idea  will draft something about it,btohqsg
I finally withdraw from syfe retis cos their returns has been dismal. Even if I put into value stocks and JnJ or P&G still can earn more lol ü§¢,btohqsg
The last portfolio I've left in syfe in the core. Still thinking whether to withdraw  cos I don't want exposure to China kraneshares and I've specific ETFs in mind alr,btohqsg
Like semiconductor ETFs like SOXX  SMH. Bascually take inspiration by browsing through syfe custom. But I won't do it on syfe cos why must I pay syfe 0.65% monthly comission on top of the fees for etf,btohqsg
I'm agreed with you  I also left in syfe  now I put in moomoo mapletree industrial and logistics and j69U  because at sfye we cannot see price at how much we putüòÇ,btohqsg
For syfe I use the customise one haha bc I will be price sensitive if I were to buy myself via the brokers. So just select a portfolio of etfs   and dca each month   it will help me buy fractional shares as well,btohqsg
Ya. Plus got time delay. Mapletree and Ascendas are quite solid. May consider them on tiger. the issue with syfe reits is got alot of funny retis inside  drag down the whole portfoilio,btohqsg
Yaya time delay 2working day  I personal felt tiger and moomoo more convenient we also can know that what price we buy in and sell outüòÇ,btohqsg
thats true also... dk what price the syfe use,btohqsg
when market down  transfer in ... it take few days,btohqsg
Syfe designed it to balance market representation with diversified exposure consisting of 20 REITs from retail  industrial  data centre  office  hospitality  and healthcare sectors.  Instead of maximizing the return.,btohqsg
Ya. So if u Have 10K in there it works out to 5$+/Month. Like a spotify subscription,btohqsg
Which etf? Per annum got 0.65%?,btohqsg
THE 0.65 is the platform fee for syfe. It is on top and over the expense ratio of your ETF. For example if u choose ARKK in syfe custom  u pay 0.75% for ARKK and 0.65 for syfe. This works out to be extremely expensive and not cost efficent over time,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI saw you have Syfe and Endowus. What about Stashaway? Which one is the best?,btohqsg
No i dont have stashaway haha,btohqsg
Before i start on it i already heard many bad stuff about it e.g. overweight on china exposure and gold,btohqsg
I saw my friend‚Äôs StashAway portfolio and i also vomited by lunch from 5 weeks ago,btohqsg
Does endowus need minimum 10K to buy the mutual funds?,btohqsg
Min $1000 for endowus to start,btohqsg
I felt moomoo and tiger more better,btohqsg
How come the cash plus can lose capital one lol,btohqsg
Syfe has too many IG influencers promoting  check out#syfe,btohqsg
Haven't earn 1.5 % alrdy lose more than that loll üòÜ,btohqsg
"Syfe IG usually will make wild claims of how syfe alone can help the influencer achieve financial ""independence"" not only for themselves  but their spouse  kid  unborn kids. Really? Show me your returns on core and reits especially",btohqsg
Their cash + more like cash minus. Suck u 1.5% pa. Even u put in POSB bank can earn more than cash + lol!,btohqsg
What bad investment they put in loll,btohqsg
That cash plus also lose capital,btohqsg
When they state 1.5 guaranteed isn't it,btohqsg
Some terrible lousy bonds  on top of that  they also love their kraneshares china exposure. Wanna lose more money,btohqsg
Not really. They said 1.5% projected. So it can be 0.000015 also can :-P. Not guaranteed,btohqsg
Oooo haha I only can say low risk is actually riskier,btohqsg
Stashaway got one like cash plus  it won't loss capital,btohqsg
When there's correction..  those small increase will be wiped out easily,btohqsg
Then that makes more sense haha,btohqsg
If can't even guarantee 1.5%   it's rly reflects v badly.,btohqsg
Stahsway one is 1.2% projected. For me I wouldn't bother with such low returns. Time to YOLO and put 100% stocks and equities + add in crypto,btohqsg
Yolo doesn't sounds like a good word to use,btohqsg
Last I put 2k at syfe reit 100%  after 3 month capital became $1929üòÇ,btohqsg
One of their syfe IG influencers put 13K in syfe retis to get 120$ in dividend after 6 months Really? ü§¢ My tiger portfolio can get more than that in a day,btohqsg
No lah. As long don't yolo by doing risky options like wall Street bets ppl can alr,btohqsg
Jialat... That's why I withdraw from syfe Liao. Ya see  I'm not the only one where the capital drop below the AMT of dividend payout,btohqsg
Paper gains or u cashed out haha,btohqsg
Paper gains. I not cashing out anytime soon hahaha. I'm a longer. Not speculative shorter,btohqsg
Hahaha that's why I withdraw it too  put in moomoo  at least I know why I loss the capital  and know the market reit markets prices at where,btohqsg
I personally gave up on sg market / retis. Cos too low returns. Tho it's Kenna risky to be doing 100% us market. But that's where it's booming soooo. STI has been stagnant for years already,btohqsg
Sg market reit is quite stable just only return around4~6%üòÇ,btohqsg
I withdraw my retis alr. Left syfe core thinking whether to withdraw and put somewhere else to make it work harder for me,btohqsg
4-6% too low alr... üòÇ I aim for 15-20%. Or beat s&p500,btohqsg
Us market need patient and strategic  up and down are very fast,btohqsg
How to make it 15-20%? üòÇ,btohqsg
It's ok. I got diamond hands. Won't sell so easily. Not paper hands,btohqsg
Large cap index funds + high growth stocks lo,btohqsg
Analysts said it was also all time high in December 2020 and now it is....? Hopefully don't explode like a bubble,btohqsg
Hahah now I only aim dividend stock and reit,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone here is good with REITs?,btohqsg
Just ask away  and we'll see how we can help,btohqsg
Basically I bought Keppel DC REIT at 2.350. Wanted to know if that‚Äôs a god buy üòÖ,btohqsg
Is that your first buy or adding on to positions?,btohqsg
2.35 is a good support level,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  not sure if im asking a qn u already addressed before. May i check why you still hold onto the Syfe Reits portfolio despite its poor performance?I totally agree with your take on Syfe so im also considering pulling funds fr Cash+ and Reits to channel to a custom portfolio instead.ü§î,btohqsg
To show the comparsion to the Diamond Hands portfolio,btohqsg
Haha that's also why I keep the capital growth one .  Haha to see if I can make a custom port to win it,btohqsg
Equity100 is also a medium as well as I dont intend to add more funds into it,btohqsg
Trying to beat Syfe to their own game,btohqsg
I see...but such a sacrifice u making...Thanks for clarifying @ChrisHMSGMuch appreciate your videos and sharing üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
It's okay lah  small money but can generate content so it will still be beneficial for the vieweers,btohqsg
As long as you have conviction in the company all is good for DCA. DCs are out of favor now due to COVID recovery play on Aviation  Tourism & hospitality sector.But with Tech going forward (Metaverse)  DCs would be key for the future,btohqsg
This is so funny idk whether to laugh or cry üòÇüò≠ but yeah syfe reits is miserable af. Cui until your head can bury into the soil down to basement 5 level,btohqsg
For me beating syfe at their own game means full withdrawal so that they don't earn any platform fees for their miserable performance,btohqsg
Beating Syfe to their own game is easier then not. We can choose what price to enter.,btohqsg
Would be a big plot twist if Syfe ever wanted to sponsor my video,btohqsg
But i guess they prefer their good looking IG influencers writing cringy captions,btohqsg
Syfe should target female customers as well,btohqsg
"Guys  when the day i start the video with ""This video is proudly sponsored by Syfe""  it means we've made it",btohqsg
Only you shifu  unless you share earnings,btohqsg
Hahah they might be shooting themselves in their foot,btohqsg
Maybe they can hire u to be fund manager,btohqsg
They would only sponsor those who are willing to say that syfe reits and core can help them achieve total finance independence for their wife  kids  unborn kids  future great grandson and how syfe beats out tiger  ikbr  JPMorgan  Warren buffet. Then will be sponsored,btohqsg
