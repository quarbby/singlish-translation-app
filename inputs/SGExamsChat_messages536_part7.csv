most of it was used for our post psle learning journeys,btohqsg
we went sentosa 3 times in a week,btohqsg
i got movie for childrens day. we go cinema,btohqsg
I mean I did find a venue but since the school didnt give us an opportunity to learn how to book a place I have no idea how much it costs altogether,btohqsg
plus when we went sentosa..its not the beach...its places like the trick eye museum  maddam tussauds and sea aquairum,btohqsg
@ilikemoneyandcatshave you tried finding places that are not hotels nor ur school hall yet?,btohqsg

"But worst case scenario is that yall jst tell the sec 4s ""blame ur school for no budget and beggars cannot be choosers"" and hold it in the school hall",btohqsg

i mean like i talk here and there on ig but thats it,btohqsg
untill u go tertiary education and gey thrown into diff jcs/poly ite courses and schs,btohqsg
Cause its either too busy  nothing to talk abt anymore  or yall secretly hate each other all the time but had to hold it in for the sake of not causing drama,btohqsg
