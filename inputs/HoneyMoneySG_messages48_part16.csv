Hi shifus  finally received my HSBC Revo card... if I wanna buy air tickets usingtrip.com  should I charge it in sgd or foreign currency (RM)? Will RM incur extra charge? Will both scenario give me 10x bonus points? TIA!,btohqsg
No. Still waiting. Kept following up with Singsaver and HSBC but nothing concrete,btohqsg
Only if it is posted amount then it will update. If it is pending then u have to wait for it to clear first before it will show up in the tracker,btohqsg
Hi anyone used prepaid Visa card fromprepaiddigitalsolutions.combefore?  Have a gift Visa card from it with some USD inside. But finding it hard to cash out. It doesn't implement 3D secure  so most of SG online shopping platform won't accept it. Any idea other than top up Amazon US account?,btohqsg
Hi gurus does anyone know if I can get cashback when I purchase something through apple's 0% interest instalment plans? It says the instalment plan is only for certain banks' credit cards. If so  will it be good to go for the 0% interest instalment to get cashback and earn additional interest by putting the money I would've spent on apple in something like t-bills?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve used it for quite a few merchants. Usually u can opt for physical one  that was its easier to use. But if u already opted for the digital one  try it on FairPrice online. I think they used to accept it,btohqsg
Thank you. Hmm  do you know any way to zero it?,btohqsg
Money manager (red colour widget) is really nice,btohqsg
I‚Äôve managed to come close to zero by spending on Amazon  or in store with physical card. Purely digital is a bit difficult,btohqsg
is the $120+$30 fund cash coupon from subscribing $10k to funds a new addition to sign up promotion?,btohqsg
Oh this one looks interesting. Will check it out  thanks!,btohqsg
Can I ask if I open GXS savings account? Currently I am saving my money at UOB One.,btohqsg
Hi sifus  anyone know if paying utilities using AXS on Ocbc 365 credit card entitled for cashback? Or i need to pay directly in the utilities App ?,btohqsg
Better read OCBC 365 TnC. I recalled must be recurring charges set on the credit card directly on the singtel portal.,btohqsg
I like to suggest something else for your consideration.OCBC 360 is essentially a salary crediting and everyday use account. I suggest setting aside your  $500 monthly savings in another high interest account.,btohqsg
Can I check how much is the service fee? Can't find it on their website,btohqsg
I also thought this  never knew can book cdg taxi from airport via app. Will still have airport surcharge right?,btohqsg
If compare to grab. It's more expensive tho,btohqsg

UOB One saving account calculate internet based on calendar month likewise for the S500/$600 spent on UOB One / EVOL credit card ?,btohqsg
Anyone know that spending on apps like fave/shopback/xnap is a mobile contactless or online spending?,btohqsg
$500 card spend for UOB ONE Account bonus interest is based on spending posted in calendar month. The interest is calculate on the monthly average daily balance in the account.The rebate on uob one/evol card is based on spending posted in statement month.,btohqsg
Anyone one know if spending with fairprice app at kopitiam is consider dinning or is it considered groceries?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I saw this morning that there is 4% interest on Coinbase and 0 fee to move in/out our money. It was 2% ish before that. 4% seems new,btohqsg
Dining. I spent via app in Fairprice Xpress  and ended up as Cheers (not a grocery) and lost cashback.,btohqsg
Coinbase come under fire from the dubious SEC then they suddenly increase their USDC interest? Seems great üôà,btohqsg
The SEC is not MAS. US and all their shitshow to promote Fednow . I let that to them üòÇ,btohqsg
SingSaver replied that they are still verifying with the bank and should be within 6 months from the date ofcompletion of all criteria. So it means earliest September assuming you completed in March ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
And the thing is in the terms they say if application date exceeded a certain date they void the claim if you didn't chase or ask about it.,btohqsg
Not sure how the two dates intersect now,btohqsg
You know it's bad when it's HSBC üòÇ,btohqsg
Need to write them every month üòÇMoneysmart is way better in this. They have a tracker  they are prompt in redemption,btohqsg
Nah  SingSaver issue. Still didn't get my Tiger welcome bonus too.I am more than happy to have HSBC since I received $600+ in GIRO cashback from CC bills in 3 months,btohqsg
Tiger welcome benefit very fast leh  like 2 days I got mine (but direct). Maybe singsaver issue.,btohqsg
