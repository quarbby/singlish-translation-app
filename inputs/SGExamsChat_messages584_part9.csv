Or 30 yr old getting $10k per month,btohqsg
And why‚Äôs a 20 yr old managing 1 mil? New Sam Bankman,btohqsg
Then what you gonna RSI index to ‚Äúspeculate‚Äù price of crypto ah üòÇ,btohqsg
I believe that the Market is not efficient,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all just betting and guessing,btohqsg
Bro think about it  quant firms are hiring math PhDs to come up with strats which only work a short term  and even then their profit margin is so little  what makes you think some shitty set of lines is gonna be able to predict price movements,btohqsg
There is a legit strategy to build a optical fibre connection from NYSE to hedge funds for high frequency trading,btohqsg
Just for that few milliseconds and its earning money,btohqsg
Technical analysis does help to a certain extend but u need to know what u are doing,btohqsg
Drawing a few lines dont help if udk what u are doing,btohqsg
Yes for established firms who have a high market cap  but the average hobbyist trader is not going to be able to do this  so why even bother with technical analysis / prediction models,btohqsg
Its up to your own trading outcome leh. If u wanna get 10x in the shortest time allowable  are u gonna buy into dividends stocks and let it grow?,btohqsg
But that is gonna be gambling rdy,btohqsg
My opinion is  its up to individual to spend their money,btohqsg
Exactly  if this is your goal  don‚Äôt go to the stock market  make a trip to MBS casino or 4D / TOTO,btohqsg
But the younger you are  the more u should be more adventurous,btohqsg
‚ÄúAdventurous‚Äù with money? That just sounds like an excuse for not having financial discipline,btohqsg
Not saying you should be 100% risk averse  but keep it low,btohqsg
Again ah why u wanna throw 1k in divided stock collecting $10+ per year,btohqsg
If u are a student den again no point,btohqsg
When u go out to work u can easily gain back,btohqsg
But again im no financial advisor,btohqsg
If u scared just put inside singlife,btohqsg
Dont lose away your student loan on options,btohqsg
so why can we only invest when we are 18 and above,btohqsg
i did and i don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
Because the law says so i guess,btohqsg
we can learn frm accounting books ???,btohqsg
On paper tesla no one should be buying tesla due to its high p/e ratio,btohqsg
But look at where it is now,btohqsg
And part of being adult is that u are old enough to take responsibility of your own doings,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think this has much to do with accounting,btohqsg
Cannot complain to mommy that u lose your money in stocks,btohqsg
I think is more abt ability to make wise choices (theoretically),btohqsg
Similar idea to like drinking age etc,btohqsg
And the ability to take ownership of your own doings,btohqsg
But it has good business prospects so it‚Äôs a good investment  and that‚Äôs why the stock price is inching up,btohqsg
If you below 18  whatever contract given to u is useless,btohqsg
The main reason i see from investopedia is you either dont have enough money or u dont truely understand what u are doing yet,btohqsg
main thing is still dont have enough money,btohqsg
It‚Äôs because the average person  let alone a kid  doesn‚Äôt have enough financial literacy to do it  and scammers capitalise on this real well by selling people bogus advice or ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù schemes,btohqsg
Got some is due to work cannot invest one,btohqsg
Thats why brokerage will ask beforehand,btohqsg
Anyone ever had a stye before ?,btohqsg
If you earn $15k or more a month  can,btohqsg
how long does hair stay curly for,btohqsg
Why retire late when you can retire early,btohqsg
Their time is u work for a company for 30 years den retire,btohqsg
Just curious  anyone working part time rn during the holis  what's Ur pay per hour,btohqsg
I working while studyingRate is $14/hr,btohqsg
