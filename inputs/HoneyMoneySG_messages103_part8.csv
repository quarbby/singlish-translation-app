So my intention is to take loans and then find a better way to grow it..  definitely not a good idea but I don't can't think of a better solution...,btohqsg
What u are doing is abitrage  if your finance is stable  this is what the rich is doing  but with high interest rate and rocky market  u are walking on the cliff edge,btohqsg
Reducing your accrued interest is definitely important. I hold a different view  accrued interest matters with or without selling the house.Without accrued interest  the govt is paying you interest  which is used in various forms (CPF life etc). With accrued interest  you are paying it yourself. Accrued interest is still a real cost  and as with any balance sheets  itâ€™s good to reduce debts/interest  esp when loan expense is 2.6% vs interest income of 2.5%.If you decide to stay in this forever home  then youâ€™ll have more CPF for retirement. If you decide to sell it and opt for second BTO  then youâ€™ll get more profits in lieu of interests paid back by yourself.,btohqsg
In the past when home loan rates from banks are <1.5%  thereâ€™s an arbitrage by using more loan and keeping OA in CPF to earn 2.5% interest. Thatâ€™s not the case now,btohqsg
Are you able to pay bulk and not the full payment? Taking loans and investing in instruments that does garner better returns to cover the rates is definitely not the way.Seeing your portfolio is only banks and mmf where thereâ€™s no saying of when they will lower their rates againPlus you said you are unemployed so what you have now should be your rainy funds,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. I was actually really okay in terms with my finances  unfortunately my family got scammed la.. so I lost 75k.. the 75k loss is not the big concern but because of the lack of capital  the intangible opportunity for interest or investment gains are strongly affected,btohqsg
I agree. Now I'm thinking of terminating my term insurance. The coverage is minimal and returns will take another 9 years to break even.,btohqsg
Term insurance got returns? Insurance should be the last thing to consider I feel. If you were to get it back a later age  will be too expensive and subjected to health as well,btohqsg
Gg xnap ðŸ¥² need to bring cash liao,btohqsg
Coverage only 50k. In event of death before 65  it will be 150k..I have paid 10 year of $120.. I need to pay another 10 years to break even.,btohqsg
How do u earn money from term plan that only covers until 65???,btohqsg
Go and get a job and then Go into DRS,btohqsg
But the monthly premium is something I want to cut.. I'm also paying for my spouse  hers cost more than mine.. with 100k coverage.,btohqsg
I think is those term plan that will return the premium if he dont manage to claim from the insurance when the term end,btohqsg
It covers until I die or I make a claim... I don't have to pay after 20 years.,btohqsg
Sorry..  what's DRS? And why should I declare bankrupt...,btohqsg
Now it sound like whole life limited pay insurance,btohqsg
Your interest payment will snowball and have no income to service  it's very hard to recover,btohqsg
Oh. I can clear my debt.. I mean I do have emergency cash stash away.. but it still hurts to know that 75k gone just like that from a scam.,btohqsg
For $41k get drs and blackmark?,btohqsg
Money gone can earn back  but stress from creditors is very damaging for mental health,btohqsg
My credit rating is AA. Even not working  the banks didn't remove my credit cards.. cos I never once default before,btohqsg
Bank din remove coz u din update employment status lol,btohqsg
Take a break and rethink your plan  if you can clear your debt so be it. Just look at it as an expensive lesson learnt..,btohqsg
My question to the community is that.. despite the loans that I have.. I still have cash which I want to maximize the growth in the fastest way possible .,btohqsg
What if it is not growth?,btohqsg
The issue is you have no job and yet not enough liquid assets to generate a steady income. Kind of stuck.U should go back to workingâ€¦,btohqsg
Hahaha. yea I guess so. Lol,btohqsg
I think it also depends on your risk level and how much liquidity you have that can risk,btohqsg
I have to find one that fits me.. I still have 2 children.. both with ADHD and ASD,btohqsg
No returns will beat the interest eir of 5.5% and above,btohqsg
So yea.. my background is complicated. Very different from the norm.,btohqsg
Usually this kind have to do free lance.,btohqsg
200k as liquid if I don't go back to UOB,btohqsg
Maybe you need to calculate if repaying early will be more cost saving than paying per month,btohqsg
If you got cash to repay the loan  nego with the bank for a discount,btohqsg
All the more u need to keep your term insurance,btohqsg
I know 200k cannot do much la. But at least can tank for awhile.. until I find something do-able.,btohqsg
Can I know if buy foodpanda voucher from ShopBack app is considered what mcc?,btohqsg
Tell them you got no job then want to repay early before you got no money pay  then bank scared will let you pay early liao haha,btohqsg
Ohh. Ok... Actually my coverage was also 100k. But something happened to me so it dropped to 50k coverage after I claim 50k,btohqsg
U arenâ€™t related to this guy called domo hor?,btohqsg
200k to a person who spend 1k a month or to a family that spend a few k a month is totally different story leh,btohqsg
Usually in this mental state you will make bad decisions and lead to further loss.,btohqsg
No I don't know anyone with that name.,btohqsg
This is a very good advice. I'll remember it.,btohqsg
Did u file a police report? Any possibility to get the money back through legal avenues?,btohqsg
Yea I know.. now is just trying to make as much as possible with what I have...,btohqsg
Can't get back alr. It's really dumb of my father-in-law la... Those stupid Nigeria scam,btohqsg
Given your situation I would caution u on falling for another scamSometimes too anxious will easily fall prey.,btohqsg
