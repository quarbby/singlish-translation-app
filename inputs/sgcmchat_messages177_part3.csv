you think this one covered under fire theft,btohqsg
I think this one covered under medical insurance,btohqsg
Who agrees with me on pop and bang are nice but when u over do it just becomes damn annoying,btohqsg
@k4gesyr new vid u good ah üíÄ,btohqsg
you out of pocket man üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
just tuck it in your pocket,btohqsg
double it and give to the next person,btohqsg
Hm rly? Damn I always thought it until dec,btohqsg
i mean it depends on what kinda pop and bang,btohqsg
if it has flares and shit rev however u want,btohqsg
but if its like normal just bang then uhm,btohqsg
after 4 times shuddup unless ppl ask u to rev more,btohqsg
i think pops and bangs are mostly fucking disgusting  esp on turbo cars where they are just fart cannons. There are some small exceptions here and there (some mclarens maybe?) but 99% of the nice sounding pops/bangs are on NA cars and the car is not intentionally tuned to produce them,btohqsg
Don't do it in a residential neighbourhood,btohqsg
Pop and bangs at car meet near residential area is basically the same as calling LTA and TP to the car meet.,btohqsg
i think we just gotta enjoy wat we have lah,btohqsg
its btr than having none at all,btohqsg
When ppl 2 step and disperse the meet 10 minutes after u drove 40 min to arrive  its hard to enjoy bruh,btohqsg
ye thats the shitty part lah,btohqsg
welp just gotta learn how to control,btohqsg
so that LTA dont harass us,btohqsg
LTA not harassing us fr. They are responding to residents being harassed in their homes by pops and bangs,btohqsg
light overruns from lifting off the throttle is still fine,btohqsg
Cooper S  M cars tend to do that.,btohqsg
but actual pop and bangs aren't good sounding imo,btohqsg
unless they serve a performance purpose. i.e anti-lag on WRC cars,btohqsg
There are some light pops that is fine. Not those loud and disturbing bangs.,btohqsg
i concur. if the car has it stock and isn't obnoxious  it's fine.,btohqsg
Most bmw burble is subtle and nice,btohqsg
the light overrun is quite pleasant in sport mode actually,btohqsg
Also y r u up. I tot u sleeping in,btohqsg
not too beng  not too obnoxious. subtle enough to remind you that you're in sports mode,btohqsg
fixed my sleep schedule  i think.,btohqsg
no more check engine light ah,btohqsg
yesterday all the warning lights pinging,btohqsg
they can pop on upshifts from ignition interruption and resumption,btohqsg
and fuel can can dumped into the exhaust from aggressive cam overlap,btohqsg
not from turbo fart cannon style tunes from dumping fuel into the exhaust yes,btohqsg
what rubbish. you tune cams to pop?,btohqsg
cam timing and overlap to pop?,btohqsg
I think the difference here is intentional and functional (anti lag) and unintentional / aesthetic (crackle map),btohqsg
hey man if you dont like my opinion  dont listen to it,btohqsg
a golf gti is a very good example,btohqsg
Im pretty fucking sure though that any given car doesnt pop and bang while stationary in a carpark,btohqsg
i already told you what causes pop. dont give me this tuned to pop and 'by right na cars should not pop' nonsense. the same logic applies to all cars,btohqsg
our friend thinks turbo cars are 'meant to pop' unlike NA cars. lmao,btohqsg
i think you're missing the ENTIRE point here,btohqsg
i drive a turbo family car,btohqsg
yes it pops and bangs like an aventador üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
bro. dont you know. aventador got na engine. not meant to pop. you are imagining things,btohqsg
