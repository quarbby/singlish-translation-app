long long time ago in a galaxy far away.. people used to mock me for saying UOB One is a 10% cashback card because they say it is a 8.3% cashback card.. $500 / $6000 = 8.33% cashback.but my point is the non specific merchants are non discretionary spend in the first place.. and if i fill it up with $600 SP Power (which nobody else in the market can give 4.3% cashback).. isn't the $1400 spend at say shopee PURE 10% cashback?,btohqsg
