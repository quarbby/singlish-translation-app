If anyone matched their amaze card with ocbc infinity Mastercard for travel? Does it give good cashback? And how long to apply? Thanks!,btohqsg
ocbc infinity Mastercard only 1.6%  still lower than amaze charge 2+%  but if you use for fcy  still cheaper than 3.25% charge,btohqsg
Oh yea got charges one... then forget it... thank you,btohqsg
unless you topup to wallet  but will not earn 1.6% from ocbc,btohqsg
Wah like that... chey..... thank you,btohqsg
Can I check if this is 1st 500 to register and get approve?Or 1st 500 to complete spending?J to make sure that it‚Äôs 1st 500 to get approved,btohqsg
get approved to be within 500.those who didnt complete spend then get disqualified,btohqsg
Thanks! Currently is there any promo for amaze?,btohqsg
the usual instaponts if you use this link and add the referral codeüí¥ Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze,btohqsg
This one is for new Citi CC only?,btohqsg
yeah that was what my dad told me as well when last time the interest rates were almost 0 all the time,btohqsg
With UOB One account nerfed  those who have less than 75k (probably started work/put most of their money elsewhere)  but are able to meet the spend  save and salary criteria would prefer OCBC 360 account's 3.85% p.a. but if they only spend less than $800 on the OCBC 365 card  they'll lose the bonus cashback (which isn't that good in the first place).You can always forgo the tiny 0.6% p.a. for the monthly $40 cashback on the UOB EVOL card. To match $40 cashback with 0.6% p.a. interest  you'll need to have at least 81k in the account  which then you'll probably wouldn't mind not getting the bonus cashback on OCBC 365 card.,btohqsg
Tbill / FD whichever gives you higher than OA just go üòù,btohqsg
You mean it is better to stick with UOB EVOL and UOB One Account instead of switching over to OCBC 360 and OCBC 365?,btohqsg
Assuming OCBC don‚Äôt adjust their rates.,btohqsg
Got my first ocbc 360 interest today! But smaller then what j expected .. I am expecting 4.65% but maybe my funding not high enough... to max the tier I need how much to be in please? I thought 75k above?,btohqsg
I thought the earn bouns interest is only 500sgd and u can pair with ocbc infinity for 1.6% cashback without minimum spend,btohqsg
Tnc says so  but no harm trying,btohqsg
Based on 75k  salary  save n spend EIR is 3.85%.If U looking at 4.65%  then 100k  salary  save n spend,btohqsg
Yes. Infinity spending 500$ is eligible for bonus interest.Take note the 500$ spend must be eligible spend.,btohqsg

Hi all  does UOB provide any virtual cards like Citi does? I just applied UOB Lady's and gotten approval  but I'm currently not in SG so can't retrieve the physical card. But would like to use the card.,btohqsg
Thank you! Gotcha! Then it's very easy to get over 100k if keep growing 500sgd per month,btohqsg
When the amount exceed Ur comfy level  then U rotate out n find somewhere to park for 1mth to reset back to 100k,btohqsg
Yea I got the calculator but to figure out the lumpsum need keep trial and error to find the perfect number,btohqsg
Usually is best from what 99000 then 500 2 times then reset 1 time?,btohqsg
you still need $500 minimum spend for acct 360 if want to get extra interest,btohqsg
No fee ah  what u see for the rate is what u get,btohqsg
what not buy t bills get a bit higher?,btohqsg
I start with 100K and adding $501 every month  will reset after 12 mths which is 106K,btohqsg
who say t bill is higher?,btohqsg
Depend on ur own comfort level. For me I max 100k  after tat keep adding 500 monthly till I feel like rotating out,btohqsg
Can I confirm.. I use a credit card to top up amaze ewallet SGD first. Then inside Amaze ewallet I convert SGD to MYR. Then in TNG ewallet app  I top up using my Amaze card (which set to amaze ewallet) then for example amaze I got 350MYR then I transfer 350MYR to TNG ewallet so my TNG ewallet will have exact 350MYR without any fees right? Is there a cap for transfer?,btohqsg
May 30 US t bill yields 5.35%,btohqsg
And rem to add 500 on the 1st of every month.For me I add 520. Cause of PH n credit date etc.... lazy to count the ADB for the particular month,btohqsg
No fee but cap is subject to amaze/tng if they let u deduct large amt,btohqsg
Yup. But I mean for May that would be the case.,btohqsg
I normally use amaze+CRMC in malaysia with little cash.. I brought a youtrip card incase need to withdraw cash in malaysia. I am just thinking if it will be better if I use tng ewallet then don't need youtrip already.,btohqsg
Tng wallet acceptance is so much more then card acceptance  even small town or pasar malan can take it,btohqsg
Wondering if this moomoo is safe  why do they keep doing 6.8% promo and when you try to withdraw  they offer $20 to keep for 30 days,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why.. I face issue with not so much merchant accept cc then why I am using cash. But instead cash  I thought about if I should give a try to tng.. but I saw their got 1% fees for top up via credit card that‚Äôs why I wanna clarify it here hahaa.,btohqsg
Amaze card is consider debit card,btohqsg
Is it possible to cardup + miles credit card  then stack HSBC EGA GIRO to get the 1% cashback so that we reduce the overall cardup processing fee?,btohqsg
Yes  but as usual subject to hsbc changes in tnc,btohqsg
Find out if what happens if moo moo goes down while u are invested in cash plus.It‚Äôs china origin company.,btohqsg
Alright! Thanks Queenie! I was headache about whether I should adopt TNG ewallet app haha. I never use before  have been using cash instead.. for those merchant cannot use amaze card de.,btohqsg
