Anyway I do a collective reply to those stuck in medtecs (regardless of price)Ask what to do is clearly futile. Down 30% these few days which advice will u follow?Cut and bounceDon‚Äôt cut and dropU are asking for the impossible. One to tell u the future.There are multiple warning signs over past months but hope is a strong motivation on not doing the rational thingYour money your choice. Nobody where it is going tomorrow if anyone can tell u where it‚Äôs going in future  your guess is as good as hisEveryone financial status and risk threshold is different. No one fits all way of trading or investing.Since the damage is done  telling you what u should have done is ultimately talking bird language.Can only wish u the best and try to stay alive. Staying safe is quite out of picture already,btohqsg

But the support 0.086 is not strong,btohqsg
Another round of sell down can cripple our confidence lol,btohqsg
End of the day is see how confident you are in the company and their future prospectsIf it's for trading or short term don't need think so much lol,btohqsg
If you just blindly follow calls here and when it dropped you are lostThen better do your own homework because when the caller cut he's not obliged to inform you first,btohqsg

Just wondering what's the progress with Aspen Glove Production line AND is there any chances they might cancel their production??Announcing they want to do gloves then shareprice gets pumped up  get share placement to raise funds and then mentioned interest in getting listed on SGX main board also pumped up the share price..So happened Oh Kim Sun Sold 22 million Aspen shares worth 6 million SGD right on 9th November which is the day Aspen unhaltHmmmmm Suspicious ü§î,btohqsg
Imagine if I don‚Äôt sell. Even at today closing price I can make $180k,btohqsg
If sold at $1.50 can make $400k,btohqsg
If only one can know the future,btohqsg

MT road to 1.98 was not smooth sailing also,btohqsg
A lot of bumps in between,btohqsg

If I had known early I would have spent the money on ifast,btohqsg
One JT selloff all like that Liao,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I ask can tahan anot,btohqsg
I think the bb kana aspen. Cause they push up the px.,btohqsg
MT also sell off many times,btohqsg
How many can see their paper profits from 100% go to 0,btohqsg
When I first bought ifast   it moved much slower than MT   I cleared,btohqsg
If dmf price remain high and oil Low,btohqsg
We already know sure will make money,btohqsg
Actually if you are long term holder best not to come this chat,btohqsg
But also panick sell when it drop from $0.21 to $0.058,btohqsg
After 1 year then check the price,btohqsg
Sometimes I lazy to read notices,btohqsg
This chat more for swing trades to short term,btohqsg
Unless you can filter out all the noises,btohqsg
Now JT . We also know at 44 % utilisation rate and dmf price $6150 they make $10 million a quarter . So if 88 % utilisation rate and price higher . How much they make a quarter. ?,btohqsg
Perhaps can make $100 million per year ? Assume price remain at $6150 and oil price at us $42. And utilisation rate 88%,btohqsg
The ball in BB hands now,btohqsg
Btw Rex got news . Uob Kay hian projected they will make us $20 million for second half 2020.,btohqsg

I will carry MT with you all,btohqsg
You die  i die  we die tgt,btohqsg
Share price dont tally with company's performance de,btohqsg
When MT sold down from $0.21 and stagnant at $0.185.. also same ..,btohqsg
See how u look at it,btohqsg
If the co can produce profits and price sold down I think still got hope,btohqsg
I will hold MT for 10 yeara,btohqsg
Maybe 3 months later you say different thing,btohqsg
If no profits and share price sold down then no hope,btohqsg
Waiting for heegul to bring it up,btohqsg

Those who tell u they make from every trade is a lie,btohqsg
My fren ask me whether I got make money . My answer is always got win got lose,btohqsg
Greed can lead to winning or losing,btohqsg
If no buy will not win or lose,btohqsg
For those holding MT JT or whatever stocksJust ask yourself why you buy in the first place loh then you will know to cut or to holdIf you buy based on people calls then good luck to you,btohqsg
Maybe you can consult the person you follow for advice haha,btohqsg

But just a word of advice sometimes fund house buy and sell is based on sentiment..Also when a fund house sell they might be doing short-selling together with suppression of share price with fake sell orders push retailers down and they secretly collect at bottom..Those trading using UOBKH  MBKE  POEMS  SCB etc can go learn how to read Counter Party table.. It will come in handy,btohqsg
SIA. Buy lor. Got bonus share?,btohqsg
Why do you think I am friends with Thomas Lam?,btohqsg
He from there. Wondering if you are from there,btohqsg
I suggest if you guys want to do trading then go with the flow  market sentiment is how then you all follow.. Don't try go against it..Traders take note,btohqsg
This one you guys monitor the volume  volume will give you hint..,btohqsg
üëçjust don't go against the wave üëç,btohqsg

It‚Äôs weird that we are being redirect to aviation when it‚Äôs going to take another 1-2 years to fully recovered,btohqsg
So medtecs got chance ? lol,btohqsg
For which counter? Good or bad?,btohqsg
JT? Does this mean retailers sell off and BBs pick up?,btohqsg
Ya and it means still got bb on jt!,btohqsg
Buy volume so high meaning got hope to push up?,btohqsg
I think is BB short first  then drop liao they buy back! ü§î,btohqsg
So retailers sell because they know based on mt experience that good results will mean selldown. But if bb still hang around  that‚Äôs good!,btohqsg
Yes...that is what happened yesterday...classic BB push to 12,btohqsg
I doubt anyone of us here sold when results came out,btohqsg
I mean I sold on Tuesday la,btohqsg
They work hand in hand. Party A sell 10 million to party B . Then they collect back 20 million shares .,btohqsg
Since work hand in hand . Party A to party B no loss,btohqsg
Sounds right...Bb just need to trigger a bit  then retailers panic and then sell down....possible?,btohqsg
There are many who buy cheap,btohqsg
Even at today closing price still profit,btohqsg
They want force retailer to sell,btohqsg
They also triggered to sell down mah,btohqsg
Will bb repeat same trick tmr?,btohqsg
They triggered 10 million . Buy back 20 or 30 millions,btohqsg
I remembered someone said that uob bought at 11x...,btohqsg
Think of different scenarios and how to react accordingly,btohqsg
Yes and no . JT got good results ... if they repeat will retailers scare off,btohqsg
Tomorrow 9am all will know the answer,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt sleep.. counting down to 9am tmr,btohqsg
Now autopsy is good. Set plan but stillUnverifiable.Best guessAlways good to start from something but be open to different perspective. Repeating same thing to ownself long enough will become truth,btohqsg
He say short selling together to suppress price,btohqsg
Haha... we are trying to outsmart Bbs üòÅ,btohqsg
Fake sell order and secretly collect at bottom,btohqsg
MT is most classic examples . How it was pushed down and then push up,btohqsg
And buy in at 88 for jt.. so 88 is kinda support then?,btohqsg
Julius is legit bo? Sound dubious. Lol,btohqsg
MT I think got at least 3 major push downs . $0.21 to $0.14. Then $0.89 to $0.57. Then $1.98 to $1.60. JT experience one today,btohqsg
Read with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
But wat he say make sense,btohqsg
Short sell together to suppress price,btohqsg
I am only asking because many people call for him,btohqsg
This is 2nd time for JT,btohqsg
If not I won't bother asking lol,btohqsg
Go for facts. Verifiable or sensible ones,btohqsg
First time never push down so many pips,btohqsg
Not because some angmoh buy this price means won‚Äôt drop below,btohqsg
Jt recovered very well and fast after the crash,btohqsg
First round from $0.048 to $0.039,btohqsg

So make sense to push down la,btohqsg
They sell then buy back we tot is accumulation lol,btohqsg
