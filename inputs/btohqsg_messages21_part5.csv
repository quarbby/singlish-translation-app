Hi. May I know do Rajah residents have any tele group?,btohqsg
Anybody has idea abt Woodlands Urban Rise BTO?,btohqsg
Anyone knows at which stage do we have to decide whether we want to do a joint tenancy or tenancy in common? During HFE application  I think we put both parties as owners to get an estimated loan amount - but this does not confirm whether we want to proceed with a joint tenancy right?,btohqsg
Mine was during the appointment to sign the lease for the flat,btohqsg
So if during HFE application  we listed both as owners to get a rough estimated loan amount. How can we go about getting the assessment for one owner only? And do we need to prepare a HFE letter for a single owner ahead of the first appointment?,btohqsg
I'm not sure  we selected our flat before the HFE rules kicked in ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Cannot once HFE approved  itâ€™s more or less final.  No reassessment,btohqsg
But u can try your luck to appeal  but base on your reason u give. I feel high chance will be rejected.,btohqsg
Why do you want assessment based on only one owner's income?,btohqsg
Has anyone popped in to check on West Hill recently ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Shld be either next week mon or next next week monNo news yet lei ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Feb24 de delay for quite long due to CNY,btohqsg
I saw the about delifrance hdb hub  the temporary tables & chairs are out. The Feb'24 BTO should be lauch anytime from now.,btohqsg
Delay what delay...Not uncommon for BTO exercises to start end of the month and overlap to first week of the following month even without CNY,btohqsg
What has the temporary tables and chairs to do with sales launch...?,btohqsg
You can just go & see delifrance hdb hub opposite (MayBank)about 2nd level  before lauch temporary tables & chairs will out. They will keep after launch over.,btohqsg
May be the table is for Q&A (BTO)......ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Do they always put out extra tables and chairs when there is an upcoming launch?New showflat layout or models in the galleries?Or  are there staff assisting people who are less IT savvy with submitting an application?,btohqsg

Single owner so won't incur ABSD on second property,btohqsg
Hello  can anyone help to advise where to click to print the HFE Letter? Is there supposed to be a downloadable PDF?,btohqsg
Why you need to print? HDB can access it when you go for flat selection,btohqsg
I was told need to print hardcopy for HDB to file,btohqsg
Control + P and save as PDF or print if using computer,btohqsg
That screen is considered the letter already? ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
It will save everything as what u see on the web,btohqsg
No need as they can access it themselves internally.,btohqsg
Hello   just to check   is it possible to have reassessment of income and loans after hfe is approved if me and my spouse income changes some months down the road ?,btohqsg
No cannot. But u can try appeal with HDB,btohqsg
cant have to cancel the existing hfe,btohqsg
case to case basis you can try to appeal,btohqsg
hello  can i check if we opt for Hdb loan how do we check if we qualify for full cpf payment or need to top up cash for the month repayment?,btohqsg
You have HFE which shows you your eligible grant and loan quantum.Unit price - Grants - downpayment - CPF OA - loan.If loan is insufficient  need to pay the shortfall via cash,btohqsg
So for the loan  they will show you how much you need to pay monthly. Use that to subtract from your monthly OA contributions,btohqsg
Anyone knows if residents of Alkaff Breeze have started key collection?,btohqsg
If I cannot make it to the HDB appointment and appoint a representative  what documents must i give him to submIt to HDB?,btohqsg
Selection appt  if your flat has 2 applicants  just need 1 applicant to go. If neither can go  need to appoint a representativeSigning of lease appt needs both applicants there iirc,btohqsg
