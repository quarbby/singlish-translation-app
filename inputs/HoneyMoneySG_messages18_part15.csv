Does anyone know if SCB unlimited cashback credit card or ICBC zodiac credit card considers topping up of Revolut wallet eligible for cash back?,btohqsg
All no. Don't need to ask,btohqsg
So far I haven got any $ deducted,btohqsg
Best to call in to check  afaik mine doesn't have fall below fee deductions but I can't rmb the circumstance in under which the account was created. If you applied it the conventional way  then likely yes.,btohqsg
you have all 3 saving accs from uob  ocbc and dbs?,btohqsg
Yes  unless you fufill any of the following conditions:1. You are under 29 years old2. Your DBS Multiplier account is your first account with POSB/DBS,btohqsg
I remember seeing post that DBS will not charge the fall below fee as long as you are below 29 years old. Implemented during COVID. Moved to OCBC360 and just keep the DBS Multiplier alive for GIRO payment,btohqsg
See when will DBS revise the Multiplier interest rate,btohqsg
