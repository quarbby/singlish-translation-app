Yes.Do note Citi Cashback has a peculiar way of crediting cashback  and it is credited in blocks of $10 with a minimum of $50 each time. This means that if you spent S$800 within a single month on groceries  you would get S$64 of cashback  but only S$60 would offset your bill  leaving S$4 stuck.If you want it to be ‚Äúneat‚Äù  spend S$875 or S$1 000 instead for a nice and round S$70 or S$80 to be credited towards your statement.,btohqsg
Thanks for the heads up. V much appreciated,btohqsg
Does anyone know for the UOB Evol card  what are the dates of each statement month?,btohqsg
I think HSBC EGA giro payment for tax is ending in April 2023?,btohqsg
Tink may be different for each individual  may need to call. For my one card  it's 8th. But one account starts from 1st,btohqsg
Any request after 16 Jan 2023 will not be accepted  that‚Äôs what the website says. Or am I looking at the wrong thing,btohqsg
I see  thank you to both for answering. I will check with uob cso on it.,btohqsg
no ah  no end date for everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Related to evol  anyone knows how to covert online spending to contactless? Aka proxy like Amaze? Cos most of my spending is contactless  but half of evol needs to be online,btohqsg
Does this apply for payment of tax still?,btohqsg
what u spend on? can use say shopback pay/fave pay/fairprice app/kris+?,btohqsg
yes for giro bill payment including tax,btohqsg
Ok I go check again thanks!,btohqsg
Icic.. Evol need 50% contactless spending like Google pay  and 50% online spending like shopee  Amazon shopping.Got it. Means using favepay  Shopback pay etc  will convert spending to online spend?Tks tks,btohqsg
Makes sense. I applied EGA in Feb  the hsbc staff told me that are eGiro no longer eligible for 1% rebatw,btohqsg
everyday+ rewards still working  1% cashback for GIRO bill payments,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wanted to ask is the liquid pay still useful to make payment? As xnap is replacing it right?,btohqsg
Xnap has already replaced LiquidPay so the LiquidPay app is useless now,btohqsg
Good thing about Xnap for iPhone users is that iPhone users can pay at hawker stalls with Maybank cards  while Android users can't,btohqsg
Does instarem amaze + CRMC work for private clinics as well? Since it works for public hospitals & specialist clinics,btohqsg
just use and hope it is mcc 5814 not 6012,btohqsg
Hi  to confirm  does CRMC linked to XNAP give you 4 miles per dollar for payment?,btohqsg
haha okay  was trying to find out but can't seem to check,btohqsg
no  cos online via googlepay/applepay get at most 0.4mpd. for android can use amaze+crmc via googlepay on xnap,btohqsg
Didn't notice how I maximized bonus 9000 points in 4 days after my statement. I need to find an alternative for my crmc till the next statement haha,btohqsg
Hey gurus  quick question: can I still get 10x points for HSBC revolution if I pay using installments? As long as spends within 1k. Thanks,btohqsg
To add on example you made purchase of $1000 with installment. Qualifying during the month is $1000. Subsequent monthly installment not qualifying.,btohqsg
Hihi all  could anyone advise on best corporate credit card?,btohqsg
Minimum of $50 each time.May I know what it means? You can't case out if your Cashback amount is less than $50?Does it apply for other Citi cards too?,btohqsg
For citi cashback. Doesn't apply for citi cashback+,btohqsg
Best website to buy flight tickets? Anyone used before cheaptickets?,btohqsg
Fyi. OCBC 360 interest have been credited,btohqsg
Anyone knows when OCBC allows online purchase of Tbills using CPF OA,btohqsg
Back to my earlier example  it does not quite matter if you are going to continually use the card since the S$4 will add to your future earned cashback to be credited towards future statements (i.e. in another block of S$50).However  I use a Citibank cashback card only for grocery purposes and it will take me many months to consume my vouchers. I prefer to get all my cash back in one go.For Fairprice vouchers  it is better to get their gift card than the physical vouchers; as it is more convenient to use.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGis there any referral for XNAP??,btohqsg
Can use OCBC titanium or HSBC revo cards for XNAP? Which is better?,btohqsg
"Generally is there a ""better"" option  moneysmart vs singsaver?",btohqsg
Singsaver generally gives better gifts  while moneysmart is more consistent at automatically giving gifts once conditions are fufilled without chasing their customer service,btohqsg
I see. Odd to hear that about moneysmart when I didn‚Äôt get my reward when I applied for my UOB One through them üòÖBut thanks for explaining!,btohqsg
For EGA  the montly $2k has to stay in the account?,btohqsg
can withdraw  but must make sure the ADB is min $2k else there will be fall-below fees charged,btohqsg
Hi guys. For those who open EGA in hsbc branch. What's the waiting time? üôèAny branch recommendation?,btohqsg
For the EGA account promo   can I slowly top up every month for the high interest or i can only do it in 1 lump sum ?,btohqsg
Can anyone please point me to where I can see the eligible spend categories for Citi Cash Back+ Card? Thank you,btohqsg

Hi! Any thoughts regarding FWD Invest first plus policy? Thanks!,btohqsg
waiting now they tell me 1hrüòÇ,btohqsg
mine failed. so went to bank to do lo,btohqsg
To add on  can consider using BNPL apps such as Atome. Used it to pay for staycation with Agoda and confirmed with CSO from HSBC that atome transaction still earns 10x points under travel mcc code.,btohqsg
I was at Holland v br  on a Fri  waited 3hrs all the ppl there were complaining. Including premier members. üòÇ,btohqsg
