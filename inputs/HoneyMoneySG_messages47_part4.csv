Bidencash (yes real name) recently leaked the information for 2.1 milllion Visa cards. They are a platform for illegally acquired credit card numbers. Literally anybody could look up those leaked numbers and then use it to purchase anything.The fraudsters are creating fake ‚Äúchatgpt subscriptions‚Äù that have nothing to do with the OpenAI company. They‚Äôre just tricking banks into handing over the cash and then probably money laundering it through some shell companies.That‚Äôs why you need to always check your Credit card statements  even if you never used your card. Someone could have stolen the number and then charged random things to your account.,btohqsg
There are other possibilities. Mindful of the name/intent of the channel  would not elaborate  haha.Agree - let's be vigilant. I suggest lower our transaction threshold to be alerted. While we cannot prevent fraudulent transactions (just like we cannot prevent computer virus)  we can detect and respond when fraudulent transactions occur.,btohqsg

Hi all  when we booked online for a Royal Caribbean cruise using the DBS wwmc  we were not awarded 4mpd as dbs said that Royal Carribean registered it as a phone transaction.
