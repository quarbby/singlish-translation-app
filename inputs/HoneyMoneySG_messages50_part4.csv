May i know which is the best card to use in bangkok ? Dbs muticurrency card exchange rate is ok too.,btohqsg
I think if you are a mile chaser for redeeming air ticket  it is not worth. Is the UNI$ to SP bill value your mile at 0.006 cents per mile?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone using UOB one credit card here? ‚ÄòYour UOB ONE CARD cash rebate of S$ 76.86 has been credited on 15-Jun-23. Pls continue to use your UOB ONE CARD for more savings.‚Äô Where will this cash rebate be reflected at?,btohqsg
The first statement of each quarter,btohqsg
Just found this. UOB values your miles at $0.005 per mile that is a horrible rate. If you used it to redeem economy class ticket  I believe you can easily get $0.015 per mile.,btohqsg
Hi  new to this miles thing. May I know if it is worth using 25 000 ocbc$ to redeem 10 000 krisflyer miles. Need to pay $25 to redeem. Saw some of my ocbc$ exiring in aug  so wondering if it is worthwhile doing that. Thanks.,btohqsg
Uob app then click acct and click ur credit card to view ur statement  its reflected there,btohqsg
are u using miles to redeem flight? If so need to redeem miles anyway,btohqsg
Hi  for citi rewards  anyway to check if i have hit the 9k bonus points for the month?,btohqsg
Actually the earliest that I intend to travel might be around end this year. I have miles from citi premier miles too. So maybe this one can also redeem for cash vouchers since it is the ocbc titanium card.,btohqsg
Need to see how much points your are changing. Otherwise redeem as vouchers might be another option.,btohqsg
can add up the bonus points from citi rewards websitecitirewards.com/welcome.htm,btohqsg
Is your miles in citi premier enough to redeem ticket? Perhaps can combine both in Kris account since miles in premier does not expire. So you can keep the rest in premier till u need it in the future. Miles convert  to Kris account will have another 3 years of expiry date.,btohqsg
Can also check your credit card statement  last page to see points earned for the month,btohqsg
Thanks. It is only sufficient for 1 ticket. But if I am travelling with my friend  then miles not enough. Let's say if I am helping my friend to book her ticket  and I buy two tickets together  the other ticket can pay cash or partially offset with my miles?,btohqsg
Hi guys  any recommendation for credit cards preferably without minimum spend and used solely for petrol usage?,btohqsg
That's true. Have to do the calculations.,btohqsg
If you are traveling with friends  then you need to check if the ticket for redemption is still available. Depends on the destination  most of the time the tickets are fully redeemed many months before departure date n only left ticket for purchase. You need to book very much earlier.About partial cash  I have no answer on this.,btohqsg
Ok I see  thanks. Very much earlier meaning at least 6 to 9 months ahead?,btohqsg
My thoughts on redeeming miles. Not worth to mix cash and miles to get a ticket  does not give you optimal value. Better off either buying the ticket entirely in cash (charge to your miles card) or redeeming all the tickets in miles  but this should be done a few months in advance and chances of getting redemptions to popular destinations during peak travel periods is hard,btohqsg
Depends on destination. You need to login to SIA website to check. If more people book  the tickets may fully redeemed any time.,btohqsg
The earliest SQ allows redemption is 355 days in advance :)) for me I choose to travel off peak periods and to less popular destinations in the region  so 4-5 months in advance is ok  if your dates are flexi,btohqsg
Any hsbc premier account holders can advice on how you avoid the TRB requirements? Or do you just pay the service fee? Breakeven seems to be at around $300k deposits.,btohqsg
I heard some use the $15K per month deposit for the premier requirements,btohqsg
Thanks. That's helpful üòä I will need to do some planning.,btohqsg
Indeed  some planning is needed when redeeming miles  due to various airlines having different redemption quota per cabin per flight. But first need to convert your credit card points into miles  ready them points on standby when you need them to book. Once you see a good date just go for it  Mai tu liao üòÅüëç,btohqsg
Haha yes indeed wise words! üëçThanks Jon!,btohqsg
Hello!! Lazada department stores  is this referring to LazMall?,btohqsg
If miles only enough for 1 person  then login to SIA n check is the ticket on date of travel still available for redemption. If yes  get your friend to login n standby to buy too.Once you click n redeem successfully  your friend can then click to purchase.Is this method feasible? üòÇ,btohqsg
If use Smart scb card use on other things like NTUC will get any point?,btohqsg
No bonuses but got some point?,btohqsg
Is it check under redeem miles? Haha  seems like a joint ops with friend. Good idea  I will try it üòä thanks for suggesting.,btohqsg
1.6 pt per dollar or about 0.5% per dollar,btohqsg
Yes. Need to login to your Kris account then you can search the flight with ticket that is redeemable.,btohqsg
I'm in Seoul and everywhere  including hotel  they ask me to insert card. Which is best card to use other than the lady's card for shopping and dining ? Is it only general spending card ?,btohqsg
Careful of card skimmers. Usually I will have a specific card for overseas spending. Not worth risking your main credit debit card for this.,btohqsg
Lol guys i know im a noob but how do i transfer krispay miles to krisflyer account?,btohqsg
transaction history. only can transfer krispay miles earned from transactions in the last 7 days or redeemed from bank points,btohqsg
Is tapping safer than inserting card for beating the skimmer?,btohqsg
I think inserting higher risk because can lead to higher limits. If contactless  lower risk cos lower limits.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB evol credit card  I know max spend for 8% cashback for online and mobile contactless is $250 each.However to get the cashback  need to spend min$600  so for this  can I just spend like $350 on online  $250 on mobile contactless?I know the online only $250 spend will have 8% cashback.,btohqsg

Hello experts  i have received my UOB evol card early June  and 2 weeks later i have already received my e-statement. I didn't manage to clock-in the 600sgd  spending for the cash back. Does it means i won't be eligible for the cash back in June ? Or do i still have until end of the month to reach it ? Thank you !,btohqsg
Where have I seen this question before?,btohqsg
the tnc says need meet $600 in even if first statement period is less than a month  nevertheless can try call uob to appeal ,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong  only 2 years the points valid,btohqsg
It is a top tier card. Uob miles can pool among uob cards.,btohqsg
How much money do you need to Retire?https://youtu.be/lnI5hSC8jhE,btohqsg
U can read milelion review on another card VS card. It is not exactly 0 as they looked at the whole month how much u spent then award the bonus points together.,btohqsg
May i know if i pay sp group bill with uob amex  is it counted as 1.7%?,btohqsg
