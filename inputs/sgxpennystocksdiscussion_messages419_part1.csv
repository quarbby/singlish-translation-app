Knowing SG pattern  they will do whatever it takes to keep the economy afloat.That in mind  they wont annouce CB2.They will just do things that is simliar to CB2 but in a way can save some money such as1) dont close retail stores ( let them ownself die )2) F & B  close their seating but allow take away  give them some supports3) constructions let it continue but implement more measures ( cause if they close  they end up need pay alot of money to the sectors )4) Manufacturing  ask them Zone A/B/C  whatever shit but dont give them a dime.is a upgraded CB2 that cost govt lesser money.,btohqsg
