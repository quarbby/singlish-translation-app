I just checked NTU need physics,btohqsg
anyone in ang mo kio rn,btohqsg
I want to know if the fire rabak,btohqsg
ðŸš¨ For those going JC -Here's some help on choosing your subject combination!When choosing between H1 and H2 JC subjects  one of your considerations will be:If I take H1 for a certain subject  will it restrict my options? ðŸ¤¯The answer is YES for certain uni courses. In the above  I've compiled the popular courses from NUS and NTU  so check the courses you might be interested in before choosing subject combi :),btohqsg
But may not be accurate ah,btohqsg
Since I don't even have that,btohqsg
That means in order for me to go I must take physics as private candidate ah,btohqsg
but if U triple sci or smth,btohqsg
Then take combined science as private candidate lor,btohqsg
Yes  thousands of people have done so,btohqsg
Specifically civil/mechanical engineering in NTU tho,btohqsg
Yes  my jc friend was bcme and did civil eng,btohqsg
No o level  she was IP  RJ,btohqsg
For now I just grind bio first ah,btohqsg
Since thereâ€™s nothing much I can do,btohqsg
It's been almost 10 years. But I think they will give chance. Don't quote me though ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Eh NF when did fire trucks have spoilers ah,btohqsg
I just saw a civil defence engine pass by with a roof spoiler,btohqsg
U can combine Science (Chem  Physics),btohqsg
Idk which one he score better at so just take combine if u fuck up the physics your other one can pull u up,btohqsg
Oh man combined science give me nightmares especially chem/physics,btohqsg
The formulars in itself alr kills memory,btohqsg
Ya I also took combined sci,btohqsg
I literally went all the way to mid way through sec 4 to realise what 1/2mgh means,btohqsg
isn't combined science already technically watered down?,btohqsg
It is but I had no gauge of what real science is mah,btohqsg
Combined physics is literally just vomiting formulas without understanding it,btohqsg
For physics it was the whole energy lifecycle pretty much,btohqsg
For chemistry  bulk of my year was actually common last topic,btohqsg
So the whole year  my chem teacher was the chillest teacher in the whole school,btohqsg
I mean if he wants he can take H1 Physics too lmao,btohqsg
Fyi common last topic taken out of o levels was organic chem,btohqsg
I took pure bio and chem in Os,btohqsg
Chem paper want from 80+ to 60+,btohqsg
This meant physics had a higher weightage  topic for physics taken out was magnets,btohqsg
If he plans on moving on to actual ntu engineering,btohqsg
Might as whack h2 phy alr,btohqsg
Get him ready for the pain,btohqsg
Because if you do h1 and you move onto engineering physics,btohqsg
He's guaranteed tears either ways cuz he has no foundation in Physics but suddenly wake up and want physics,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t matter what you do  itâ€™s always guaranteed tears,btohqsg
I woke up and realised I love maths and hate Biology,btohqsg
Ok ya h2 phy is really much more desirable,btohqsg
You get practical expt practice and more content,btohqsg
Youre a male right i assume?,btohqsg
But idrk whatâ€™s the career prospects if I do maths in uni,btohqsg
Need to do something thatâ€™s practical and maths related,btohqsg
Just do well for your As first then study for physics in NS,btohqsg
Math has so much more career prospects...,btohqsg
Like that I do maths lmao,btohqsg
