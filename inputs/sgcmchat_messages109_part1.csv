sorry but civic and vios doesn‚Äôt cut it,btohqsg
Ok but like u tell me,btohqsg
Nah not rlly but it‚Äôs kinda like once  you‚Äôve seen all your standards auto go higher,btohqsg
But Like everybody have nice cars  I respect all builds,btohqsg
No leh. I think nowadays the standards are lower,btohqsg
I like his choice of SSR wheels,btohqsg
I respect all builds but some people need to chill  2 kids take picture of their car does not mean they own the scene. That's more of the problem nowadays,btohqsg
I rmb one guy kena trash talk for calling ppl regular traffic,btohqsg
Also why I like Dempsey cnks more because it's pure respect for engineering  cars and maintaining the cars and enjoying them rather than oh I am stage this stage that  this kit etc.,btohqsg
Then when someone wif a non regular traffic car poke him. His ego come out,btohqsg
Static a bit difficult unless can get jt dialed in perfectly for street use also.,btohqsg
Then still wan talk big HAHAHA and anyhow shoot the guy ask him show his car,btohqsg
The cla is static I think and he scrapes everywhere,btohqsg
DUDE THATS SICK AF NGL i love how low it goes,btohqsg
most of them on bags but got some static,btohqsg
pretty sure the red bimmer is static,btohqsg
Personally not a fan of slammed cars but that‚Äôs personal,btohqsg
Someday he's gonna be fast enough to rip his sideskirt off and cause damage to another,btohqsg
The cla is not irfanian_ eh?,btohqsg
Issit? Then why I see him driving at the same height and park at the same height everywhere while scraping on humps and road undulations?,btohqsg
Well at least the guy didn‚Äôt bother showing up ah coz mr ‚Äúregular traffic‚Äù would have gotten his face thrown away,btohqsg
Ok i think one way to look at it isTraffic car or not  they spend money to make their car look how they want so like ü§∑As long as you dont shit talk thier build in front of thier face or sum like datAlso regarding standards and taste Personal Opinion,btohqsg
Ok video but he drive low is danger to the roads so I cba,btohqsg
I think the standard is set it‚Äôs just ur own opinion if that car is above or beyond the standard,btohqsg
Once you see a flying sideskirt coming at you then you know,btohqsg
Air up or road just bumpy? Lmao,btohqsg
his 3 series was lower and he was running more camber,btohqsg
but this car give alot problem compared to 3er,btohqsg
Opine in front of their face but respect them better than shit talk behind and suck up in front of them,btohqsg
Everyone is entitled to an opinion  there's just a way of putting it out there with due respect,btohqsg
I swear the minervas are like over 10k plus like the rebarrel i think idk,btohqsg
Even Honda Grom have aftermarket for air suspension üòã,btohqsg
If the other person is mature  they would understand as well,btohqsg
