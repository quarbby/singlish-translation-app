I mean buy just to sell for profit bro. Must sinkie pwn sinkie,btohqsg
The idea is the not working yields more return than working lel,btohqsg
topup on first of month such that the balance is $600 more than the average daily balance of last month. (Not fixed $600 as your last month end balance may be higher or lower than the average daily balance),btohqsg
Ok..what abt my pay credited and withdrawn on same day.. does it affect the average balance as transaction is done same day. What alternatives i can take,btohqsg
pay credited and withdrawn on same day (before 9.30pm) will not affect average daily balance. If with later only increase in average daily balance which is good towards the $500 increment. Should learn to use the balance tracker on ocbc website and if possible the exact computation of average daily balance (e.g. transactions on Sunday/public holidays are dated next business day),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt look at dollar amount. Look at percentage.U spend small at $500 naturally the dollar gain is small.If u can hit $2k tier u get $200 cashback after 3 months. $67 per month. This is just the base cashback. If u spend on the specific merchants u can potentially get 6.7% more cashback there.,btohqsg
Thanks for the info.. Appreciated.. üòÑ,btohqsg

You can still use ocbc local fund transfer via internet banking (not mobile banking) and the purpose selection is still there,btohqsg

Hi all  i have my uob one account   the S$ 500 min spend criteria   can i combine the spending on my debit card + credit card to meet?Eg spend 250 on debit card and spend 250 on credit card? To hit 500,btohqsg
Can I confirm one thing though  if I buy my flight tickets using my citi rewards card  I still get 1point per $1 right? Eventhough I don't get the bonus. Because I use all my expenditures on that card. So I rather at least get the 1point per dollar rather than having to be limited by the max cap on the other cards.,btohqsg
Is there any ongoing promo to sign up hsbc ega?,btohqsg
For example I buy like 3 flight tickets at 1.2k each on my citi rewards card. At least I get 3k points. But on uob lady's card it's only capped at 1k?,btohqsg
Citirewards (no bonus for travel) 1200*0.4 = 480milesLadys = 1000 * 6 + 200 * 0.4 = 6080 miles,btohqsg
Wah I never realised that. Thank you so much!,btohqsg
If i were you  i will get UOB KF card. 3miles per dollar on travel (if you buying from SQ u can hit the $800 spend.So 3 X 3600 = 10800 miles. miles pool with UOB ladies but comes in end of membership year.,btohqsg
But uob KF only can buy from sq is it? No other airlines?,btohqsg
if you manage to spend 800 on SQ  3mpd on travel  dining and online shopping.Do you have a general spend card? e.g. UOB PRVI?,btohqsg
My general spend card is citi rewards. I use it for everything. Even if excluded. I'm starting to reanalyze my credit card usage strategy. Hahahha,btohqsg
Get UOB PRVI.1.2k on UOB Ladys = 6080 miles2.4k on UOB PRVI = 3360 milesIf u use UOB PRVI on expedia / agoda can get up to 8 mpd. But price might be inflatedTotal miles = 9440 miles pooled together.,btohqsg
