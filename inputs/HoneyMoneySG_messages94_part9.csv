Hello everyone  can I check with you all. When I pair my Citi Reward Card with the Amaze Card  should I use the Citi Reward Card or the Amaze Card for payments?,btohqsg
Got it  appreciate you sharing that with me.One more question  if I intend to make local or overseas transactions  can I simply use the Amaze Card they provide for payment?,btohqsg
as long as it accepts paywave just go ahead and tap as much as u want,btohqsg
Haha thank you both for sharing! Much appreciated!,btohqsg
can  check that you have chosen the right default card linked to Amaze card before the transaction  enabled the right payment settings of the Amaze card in instarem app.,btohqsg
Ah  understood. So  it means I need to switch between the card that I pair with Amaze. Great insight ! Thanks Trazora,btohqsg

Don’t ask too much. The more you ask the more they nerf(past experience from community has shown this). Just check your account month end. If you got it  you got it. If you don’t get it  nothing much u can do other than skip it next time.,btohqsg
Yea should've been more cautious speaking about these tricks. Many nerfs coming 🥲,btohqsg

Hey guys !Is it me or the DBS yuu card is underrated?I mean getting around 73$ for spending 600$ a month on Guardian  cold storage  giant ..sounds pretty good dealI am using UOB one card and i was thinking that DBS yuu kind of offers better cashbackAny thoughts?,btohqsg
If your only spending is yuu merchants and you can hit $600  yuu is better.But UOB one cc meets the UOB one account requirements and high cashback on DFI/ public transport. For most general spend also 3.33%. Depends on your spending patterns,btohqsg
