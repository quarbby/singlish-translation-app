Yes. People who emptied end of May should be safe.,btohqsg
Can I use lady’s card to earn 4 miles/dollar for travel catogery to book under gha discovery app?,btohqsg
I see! So means those people would have forsaken the one account bonus interest for June.,btohqsg
Have you tried parking cash here before??,btohqsg
Read the definition of fresh fund,btohqsg
Have to find somewhere to park to get interest lorh,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks so much! I am so confused by this earmark thing,btohqsg
ThanksTrazora! I should have been more explicit in my qns to avoid people referring me to T&Cs... I was asking for people's experience in previous rounds  how many days after deposit will the funds be usually earmarked... Cos that's an indication that the amount is correct. For context  I chose 150k  have maintained 1k balance since May. But in June  I have ~30k in and out within the same day. So I wanted to use the earmark as an early indication if my 150k today is counted... Going by the T&Cs strictly  my 150k-30k only results in 120k fresh fund  so since I've selected 150k  if it isn't sufficient  the entire fund wouldn't be earmarked at all.,btohqsg
Dbs yuu SingTel bill payment via Kisok- when I am selecting Amex option at the kiosk  it’s showing an error (100 deny). Anyone know how to fix?,btohqsg
"Get 4.2% p.a. with Chocolate Finance: Real or Not?https://youtube.com/shorts/3bM2tUUkBhASign up athttps://hmsg.link/chocolateor comment ""CHOCOLATE"" to get the link",btohqsg
what is your monthly average balance for Jun? You can probably check the June MAB on uob app tomorrow,btohqsg
Wa finally they opened up again,btohqsg
I'm not so much concerned about the MAB. I emptied my account in May... And my deposits in June was transferred out immediately before day end so end of day balance isn't increased. But my main concern is if those intra day deposit will be counted against the fresh fund requirement...,btohqsg
EXACTLY.. this is what i am also UNSURE..salary credit say $10k come in on 15th June... then I move out immediately... will be caught by the stupid clause?,btohqsg
I know there has been lengthy discussions on this topic above.But I would like to summarise:Nobody is really sure how UOB will calculate/enforce.BUT  in the worse case situation  we still get 4% p.a. if earmark fails. About 6% p.a. if earmark is successful and no clawback/penalty nonsense. So I would say it is still worth a try.,btohqsg
should be $0 then other than the base interest for May,btohqsg
UOB one card pay ZYM online also get cb ?,btohqsg
Thx u for always being kind to clear the doubts 🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi all  I plan to move all my money from OCBC 360 to HSBC EGA. Is it safe to do it today? Since OCBC 360 will credit salary and save bonus between 7-9 July only,btohqsg
Just move your other bonus interests when they are deposited,btohqsg
Amex TC also can giro via HSBC EGA right?,btohqsg
Can I leave it blank? I understand OCBC 360 need to maintain 3K,btohqsg
If you don't mind ending up with negative values,btohqsg
I see then to avoid any deduction. Better to keep 3K as per the account regulation to maintain 3’,btohqsg
"Checking regarding the singsaver june promo for citi cards. It says bill payment will be ""non-qualifying"" payment. Is TMC 24hr clinic considered bill payment?",btohqsg
Ocbc 360 first year waive fall below fee so I can keep zero ?,btohqsg
I have same plan. Waiting to cancel ocbc maybe after 6 months,btohqsg
Oh why cancel? OCBC still give a good interest for 4.05%HSBC EGA got many steps need to perform 😂. As what I know is trsf 2000 every month + 5 transactions.,btohqsg
I plan to credit back to OCBC after few months,btohqsg
Hi Chris   what do you think of chocolate finance? Any thoughts anyone?,btohqsg
Just talked about Chocolate Finance herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214552,btohqsg
That is under Managed account in Other,btohqsg
What does preferred really means?Favourite. Or where most money is?,btohqsg
Uob one + saver promo confirmed highest eir approx 5.6% pa. But max $150k.HSBC EGA max $360k but 4.x%.Both good kind of hard to choose one only. But I voted for HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
T-Bill 12 x $1mil infinity roll.,btohqsg
Chocolate finance states that if make more than 4.2% then they will charge a fee betweeen 0-2%. Does anyone know if this fee is on anything above 4.2% earnings only?,btohqsg
any idea if we can activate shopback + heymax together?,btohqsg
No. Only the last activated one will work.,btohqsg
for UOB Savings promo  only can qualify if account is zeroed out at/before 31 May right?coz TnC say 30 days before or during the promotion period. So if you had zeroed out 1 June it will be within the 30 days already?,btohqsg
Don't zero out also can. Just add on top of it. Of course EIR will be lowered,btohqsg
Thank you. Just checking. Have a friend who zeroed out on 1st or 2nd June. I think cannot qualify for the savings promo already ...,btohqsg
Anyone used interactive broker? Is this better then moomoo? 🤔,btohqsg
How can you compare ibkr to moomoo? Ibkr is one of the largest brokers in the world,btohqsg
Not asking to compare coverage. More on fees and usage.,btohqsg
I use Interactive Brokers. I prefer it just cus its not from a china company,btohqsg
I will never trust a China company to hold my assets even if in trust.,btohqsg
IBKR risk mgmt is also considered to be quite good one leh due to Thomas petterfy’s options background,btohqsg
So many racism at play. 😅,btohqsg
