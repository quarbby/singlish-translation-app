Plan to force more ppl switch to EV,btohqsg
not every carpark can charge n is still not very convenient,btohqsg
Most important is the price of ev still expensive. If cheaper than petrol car..I wun mind the inconvenienceðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Road tax v high  no difference paying petrol,btohqsg
EV are all Cat B Coe,btohqsg
Go for hybrid first before switching to full EV. My Honda Freed is about $68+ top up for 95 petrol  after LLM discount.,btohqsg
Every where in the world  fuel prices went up. Problem is over here  the price almost never come down.,btohqsg
That's y EV as a alternative is good for consumers. It's possible for electricity to have sustainable production  like solar or wind  whereas fossil fuel is a finite source that's not easily replenished.,btohqsg
The price differenceCan let u pump 3 month free patrol,btohqsg
Crazy lah sg gahmen. Other countries  buy these low carbon emission vehicle all got subsidy.  Sg gahmen cannot earn yr petrol earn yr car price first,btohqsg
EV aso like that. So exp,btohqsg
Yalor.By right cars are only meant for the top 10percent richest ppl in Sg. But they forgot abt the taxi driver phv n couriers delivery ppl ...,btohqsg
Only 1 in 10 in Sg can own car,btohqsg

Hi all. New member here. Hope to learn from u all. Thank you,btohqsg
Vezel hybrid disadvantage is the car weight. Hybrid don't really work on heavy weight vehicle.,btohqsg
Last time I rented one and do PHV. Best is around 700km. Prius has high tech hybrid among all Toyota vehicles. The weight  design and aerodynamic all go as one. Full tank I can go around 900km.,btohqsg
Can consider. Honda's hybris not as mature as Toyota hybrid.,btohqsg
daily covid numbers coming down slowly.,btohqsg

Yah  10 year warranty at Borneo. PI don't have wor.,btohqsg
Sorry  5 years only. I thought is 10 years..?,btohqsg
Got see BMW n Merc b4 ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
The battery warranty is only for total failure... Not degeneration of battery due to wear n tear... FC become lousy they wun change batt aso,btohqsg
So got warranty or no.. after few years still must spend a few k change batt if want good fc,btohqsg
Wadever savings from petrol wiped with battery change cost.. really is LPPL,btohqsg
Might as well get a 1.0L turbo car,btohqsg
Unless clock few hundred k every day then use hybrid woo hua,btohqsg
