tbh  you are so focused on building your body is because subconsciously you want the attention,btohqsg
hmm...in a way you are definitely not an introvert,btohqsg
nah I want to die looking nice,btohqsg
my PT said...he want to die BIG,btohqsg
Go big or go home ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Ok la this one abit more sadge  cause I see so many old people  single people like they old liao canâ€™t move properly  need rely on people and such  I dun wanna become like that,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I wanna train until even at 80 year old I can do what I want without relying on anyone,btohqsg
Huh? I always hear my frds use this phrase,btohqsg
i always hear it on radio,btohqsg
very sad to be at the mercy of others ~~,btohqsg
So no ~~ I refused !,btohqsg
I will die a fit old man wahahahHH,btohqsg
not at the mercy but everything have to rely on someone else to do it for u,btohqsg
yea cause not all children are filial also,btohqsg
Some you old liao they dun bother,btohqsg
Or like you have to beg them for help and such,btohqsg
Iâ€™m like eww no way I be like that,btohqsg
Honestly now you cannot have children thinking that they will feed you till old age,btohqsg
that kind of mentality is not feasible nowadays,btohqsg
yea but thereâ€™s a certain cycle I feel is like when you young and helpless they give you and lead you to being independent but when you old liao you requires the same care some time as well so itâ€™s a give and take thingy,btohqsg
You gave birth to me itâ€™s your choice and responsibility,btohqsg
but it's sad to think that your own children not able to take care of you when you are old...unlike parents take care of them when they were just born...,btohqsg
Just train for healthier body and lifestyle,btohqsg
And old n can go travel ~~,btohqsg
Singles like us who are not married and do not have kids...have to rely on ourselves more,btohqsg
I never ask you to give birth to me,btohqsg
So now I grow up liao itâ€™s my life to live,btohqsg
