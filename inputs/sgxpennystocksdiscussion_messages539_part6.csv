Pri school usually the diff bet prelim and PSLE not as much as compared to O and A levels. For O levels  getting L1R5 half of prelim is not uncommon. For A levels  all red in prelim is common  esp for those top JCs. Wonder how they are going to use prelim results for O and A.,btohqsg
Furthermore  parents may pump in lots in tuitions already  so 1 more year of tuition expenses can be a big sum,btohqsg
Just when CCS thought he got an easy time being the Education Minister,btohqsg
For PSLE  no matter what likely to have a place in sec sch  so I see lesser of an issue. For O levels  results is needed to fight for limited places in JC and poly courses. Worst is A levels  with the limited vacancies in our local U,btohqsg
Hope that those P6 kids affected will be allowed to sit for a 'promotion' exam either early in Sec 1 or at the end of Sec 1  to transfer streams or schools or otherwise.,btohqsg
NowadaysIf NA- results get below 12 Ponit.. the kid able to apply the sit foundation poly.. so the won‚Äôt flight got sit to other after take O level.Won‚Äôt fight with smart students. Very comparative..They call PFP.. I mean all the kid still have chance..,btohqsg

Oh  I don't know the details  just a general view,btohqsg
Don't think the group will collapse. But shareholders will get back nothing or almost nothing  and the bond/bank will need to take a big cut for the rescue. Priority will go to the public who bought their unfinished properties.,btohqsg
