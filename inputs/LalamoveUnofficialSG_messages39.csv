Tell them the reason you accept wrong pick n very far,btohqsg

First time I drive into bus lane. But other offence will it affect,btohqsg

Ya my after job is like 2 hours ago,btohqsg
lucky so far mine was fine.,btohqsg
Just now i called her after dropoff say i cannot complete order until i receive payment. She say ok.. Then i wait 10mins check bank still haven't transfer. Then i called her again twice never pick up the call.,btohqsg
How to move on to other jobs if current job not completed m?,btohqsg
Wasted 30mins waiting for the fking $11.40.,btohqsg
Lalamove say just complete order first and continue find orders,btohqsg
Lalamove ask me to give her mayb 1 hour say she sounded rush go to the bank all what shit,btohqsg

I told him i cant do it  please find another driver,btohqsg
I have a joker took a photo of me while i deliver to him,btohqsg
Nowadays damn stress give u these type of timeline to complete jobs,btohqsg
I had this worry too last week. Seems like as long as u start the job and complete within the mission hrs it is considered x1. So if mission time is 10am to 2pm make sure u dont load before 10am and dont drop after 2pm. It shld count as x1,btohqsg
I cheated a bit last week by those near end mission timing 8pm jobs 7.59pm i swipe complete drop off although i am still like 5 mins out. Those were counted in.,btohqsg
I was near enough not to have app prompt that i am not near location.,btohqsg
Must be customer kena cheated by the delivery guy before,btohqsg
Take photos is normal I encountered before for food & non food products. I completed & ask the sender for payment until next day than transfer lol,btohqsg
Give 1 star & block this joker. Who the hell he think he is?! What I observe not all but most people look down on people doing delivery job for some reason.,btohqsg

Exactly. I think alot of them just abuse. Some car drivers jus take and do.,btohqsg
Stand for your own rights.  Don't let others take advantage. If you want to be abused go do gj or grab. They can abuse you with 5-10km pickup then client cancel.If you think and know what the client book is not in line with the job. Just walk/drive  away please. Humans must have dignity.,btohqsg
YupEspecially foodJust tell than will take 30min call cso to cancelThink they more gan jiong than us,btohqsg
Totally agree with you... So disgusted to see how these business owners try exploiting delivery personnel..,btohqsg
I drive a van coming to a year. They texted me today if I still have the sticker ( have removed the sticker somewhere November last year)  when I replied no  they straightaway suspend my account and ask me go paste. At the same time  the amount I withdrew yesterday was cancelled ...wtF!!! Seriously???,btohqsg
After a while I just can't be fucked. Say what cannot stack or whatsoever. If their food so important they would have it ready on time. Book bike but expect car.Ban or penalized $4 I don't care. Not like lala is the only food platform. Not like they are giving tips for it.,btohqsg
Oh dear  how can they force u to paste sticker? Too much..,btohqsg
Ya they are too much. Angry,btohqsg
Llm fuck up one. They want die dir want u to paste means its a must,btohqsg
But when I sign last year I rmb them saying must paste for a minimum 6 months ..no one says about must paste there for good,btohqsg
Yes 6mths is the contract. My neighbour just had his removed too,btohqsg
Aiyah they like to change their terms and conditions. Last year they ban me dunno how many times then perm ban me. I requested to return deposit. Called me back say will process etc after 10 days or so.  After a few days unban me and I still can take jobs.It's really not like they are the only unique ones. Ban me then I go other platform loh. I earn more on lala meh? Ban me I go drive gj. It's fine. Not like lala so good that I can't live without them.Now diesel so ex I got no trips nearby I go back home. Not going to wait a few hours till 5-6pm just so I can earn 10-20dollars. I rather rest.,btohqsg
Lalamove smart ask you paste sticker because once you have sticker you cannot join GOGOX,btohqsg
GOGOX policy is if your found with competitors logo immediately banned,btohqsg
Lalavan can really make money if you know how to drive.,btohqsg
Did you do a lot of bike jobs ?,btohqsg
Wake up early find a hot spot and camp. Only accept jobs that make sense,btohqsg
When I was doing car I did one job Mandai to Changi bike job . Instant regret,btohqsg

But I tried.. Only can hit close to 200 with sibei lots of efforts.,btohqsg
That's why he is the idol here,btohqsg
You work what time to what time,btohqsg

You start and end work what time?,btohqsg
Sibei hungry car.. Drink petrol like buffet,btohqsg

So much for doing the right thing lol,btohqsg
Anyone can share what determines peak surcharge & district surcharge?,btohqsg
Got 2 orders 15mins apart only  both from raffles city.. 1 has peak & district surcharge.. while the other got none,btohqsg
the video is üí™üèº. People don‚Äôt think much of us delivery drivers. Just take the parcels from us and close door in our faces. Very rarely will the recipient appreciate the delivery driver. Rain or shine we are always there. Just to send them their creature comforts. Relegated to being second- or third-class citizens. Salute to all delivery drivers.,btohqsg
Doing a thankless job. Braving the weather,btohqsg
I have this same question too. Any seniors here can clarify. Hahaha,btohqsg
Am looking for parcel delivery contract with van providedPls pm me if anyone has it. Thanks,btohqsg
"look under ""special location charges"" under profile-settings-pricing details. car/motor got different charges for different times and different days and also vary depending on which part of cbd.",btohqsg
What about the people who thank you.,btohqsg
Customers leave a tray of sweets and some packet drink at door,btohqsg
So need how many to thank then is enough?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not so much the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. It‚Äôs more about the attitude that people have towards delivery providers,btohqsg
Technically they pay for the service. They can dont say thank you. Saying thank you is just being polite. Clearly you are not very long in this line.,btohqsg
They dont even say to say anything,btohqsg
Perhaps. But manners maketh man. Nothing wrong with please and thank you,btohqsg
I have a very different experience ...  my customers almost always say thank you (sincerely)  some will say repeatedly with gratitude esp if it's after dinner hours or if item is heavyI think the social climate is very different now  esp after covid. Ppl are a lot more appreciative and respectfulOf cos i still hear horror stories of delivery guys getting verbally abused by customers - but i think that's the individual customer's problem. That kind of ppl will be rude to anyone and everyone,btohqsg
Any lorry drivers here? I have a client that needs lorry.,btohqsg
just take and go. dont talk so much,btohqsg
Deliver what items? If i may ask üòâ,btohqsg

Yes very good already.. U r awesome üëç,btohqsg
Guys..please beware of this order..customer uncontactable and last min cancel where i already waited here for 20mins,btohqsg

Hi is it ok if i double stack order and able to deliver it within 1 hour?,btohqsg
*Delicate Deliveries and Claims* üßÅüç∞We've introduced a new process to ensure delicate items such as cakes and pastries reach your customers picture perfect.To all driver partners  we would like to reiterate that you need to check what is the food item and should it be delicate items like cupcakes or a whole cake  politely request to take a photo of the food condition and packaging at the pick-up location. üì∏Should you not receive the items in good condition  ensure you highlight this to the merchant immediately. ‚ùóRemember to upload the photo of the cake in your Loading page in the driver app before leaving the pick-up location and take extra care while handling the delicate items. Compensation will apply should damages occur during the delivery process.Read more on the new T&C here:bit.ly/llmcake,btohqsg
emphasize more on the  cake. how abt black package seal looks illegal can request to open and see what item.... üòÇ,btohqsg
Later need security license to do delivery!,btohqsg
That one doesnt matter  llm alrdy cover in t&c that we are not liable for any illegal items that user includes in package,btohqsg

Am i the only one here whom always getting suspended?,btohqsg
I already give very legit ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù,btohqsg
Yea sometimes I stack too much until run out of time,btohqsg
Soon I realise not worth the suspension in long run,btohqsg
Same location stacking is gd strategy,btohqsg
refresh  here are some valid order cancellation reasons:1. Driver is unwell - MC required2. Vehicle breakdown - Repair receipt with the relevant date and vehicle plate number3. Customer cancellation - Screenshot of call log or message to be provided as proof4. Customer unreachable - Screenshot of call log to be provided as proof5. Previous order delay - Must be informed to CS team 40mins before order6. Family emergencies - Supported by black and white documentation7. Delay by customer for more than 30mins (No cancellation and waiting fee will be awarded)8. Wrong specification from customer upon arriving at pick-up location - Screenshot of call log or message to be provided as proof,btohqsg
Careful cos few more times will lead to termination,btohqsg
Fucking hell. 8am got surge in calls for llm hotline?,btohqsg
It's forever one  at least I've tried to call so many times I always get the same msg. Gave up on the hotline already,btohqsg
Yeah don‚Äôt waste your time trying next time.,btohqsg
lalamove CS is the worst of all delivery apps. that is why we dont bother contacting CS.,btohqsg
apps is 24hours  CS work only 8am-10pm. anything happen after that  lan lan suck thumb. solve your own shit. üòÇ u become your own CS to answer your problem.,btohqsg
