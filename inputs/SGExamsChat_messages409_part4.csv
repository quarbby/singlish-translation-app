By ur therapist in general ah,btohqsg
I use to think therapist is jobs for empaths,btohqsg
people who commit suicide are optimists,btohqsg
And you need to take care of your own mental health. Don’t take on your patients’ emotional burdens onto your own to solve  either.,btohqsg
enjoy the simple things in life,btohqsg
Maybe  that’s the point of life. The purpose of living. Having a lot to lose when you fall makes your life even more emotionally vibrant and worth living.,btohqsg
Wlao I can't type tdy ist,btohqsg
Because its just life. Its going to be over before you know it. And at the end? If you experience truly enough  you’ll have good stories to tell at the end of how you actually lived.,btohqsg
I feel like shit experiences make us rly appreciate the good ones even more,btohqsg
Cuz that's this basis of comparison,btohqsg
Don't focus on the tangible. And easy come  easy go.,btohqsg
Not to minimise that the shit was bad ah,btohqsg
And also make for interesting stories,btohqsg
Altho usu it's not exactly funny more just jaw dropping,btohqsg
I was thinking how dna polymerase and the stupid end replication problem is the reason why our lifes are much shorter,btohqsg
If there was a way around it,btohqsg
but cant change it cos it would mess up everything,btohqsg
What about thinking about solutions to issues within your examinable syllabus first?,btohqsg
hey hey curiosity is in the 21st century learning outcomes,btohqsg
Spend sometime figure out  what do you want your eulogy to be. =),btohqsg

argentina had a whole 40 minutes to catch,btohqsg
Messi did an interview pre game saying they will confm win,btohqsg
saudi only had 2 on target,btohqsg
i feel vv sad for the vast majority of the fans who support argentina,btohqsg
The two goals were very good though,btohqsg
bro iw to see the match,btohqsg
i rly wonder what really went wrong,btohqsg
can he change course if he does well,btohqsg
subject to approval  but generally much higher chance if he does well,btohqsg
cos the program he wants may be competitive,btohqsg
he's going to get way better answers by emailing the faculty office,btohqsg
if uni GPA 3.5 can change anot,btohqsg
Only way is to do common engineering courses then switch over  if he has not entered uni and has accepted the offer. Else  reapply next year.,btohqsg
If he does well in like EE,btohqsg
If uni  then of course  smart is based on the exam scores  higher the better and mind you  the competition.,btohqsg
then can do well and transfer,btohqsg
Not my problem if he don't score and cannot switch course.,btohqsg
I'm trying to say  smart not equal to high cap.,btohqsg
just tell him to study his ass off if he wants a chance,btohqsg
at least now NTU got the annoying general education curriculum in first sems,btohqsg
I think he last minute burnout,btohqsg
just some mods you'd have to make up and stuff,btohqsg
