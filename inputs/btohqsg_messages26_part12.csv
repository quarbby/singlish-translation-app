Yishun beacon was oversubscribed then they still cancelled it.,btohqsg
so sad.. 33 is good number,btohqsg
hope u get a decent number this time.. many projects should have higher chance,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there a specific application or process to apply for this additional ballot chance  or is it automatically granted to eligible applicants? (For staying nearing parents),btohqsg
Haven't mop cannot apply new. Example if ur current flat MOP 1 more yrs and this Launch project need to wait 3 yrs u can't take it as still have 3 yrs wait means after my MOP already.,btohqsg
so just to clarify  you‚Äôre currently staying in a BTO  and before your MOP period was up  you applied for a 2nd BTO  intending to sell your 1st BTO   hoping the construction time would overlap with your remaining MOP?,btohqsg
You have to complete MOP first regardless if current flat is BTO or resale. After hit MOP then can apply BTO.,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say the system is working as intended. if you‚Äôve already benefited from subsidies through public housing whether BTO or resale you should rightly be prevented from trying to do so as easily again. this sort of behaviour is exactly what HDB is trying to prevent  so first timers get priority. not sure what ground you‚Äôre standing on to feel any sort of anger against HDB.,btohqsg
need to chose the MCPS scheme during application. not auto. some ppl may not want to use it if parents planning to move out,btohqsg
Current house is resale so we didn't get subsidies back then. So we need a bigger house now due to more children. So I don't see why I can't be angry when my application was cancelled last time. Now fulfilling what they required finally.,btohqsg
You can apply. Only after MOP üòå,btohqsg
And just advising the person who asked earlier on why they can't apply bto when current flat haven mop. Not here to debate what kind of behaviour can apply bto or not.,btohqsg
Hi  which area? Your application rejected? Pm me . I suggest you see your MP for appeal if is rejected,btohqsg
Thanks  we went it didn't help too. Anw it was over for so long. Back in 2022. No more units left for us to choose anymore. Haaha.,btohqsg
How many times u apply Yr bto?,btohqsg
Just curious  are u considered first timer when applying for bto since u say the current unit no grant.,btohqsg
The maximum amount of HDB resale grants you can get is S$230 000. With the three main grants ‚Äî Family Grant  EHG and PHG ‚Äî available for resale flats  you may be eligible to receive a total of S$230 000.I check tru Google,btohqsg
You‚Äôre considered first timer if you‚Äôve never bought a flat before. If you buy resale  den will be considered 2nd timer,btohqsg
Back then resale got no subsidies or u choose not to take subsidies? Just curious,btohqsg
Fyi  By not using the grant for resale   even if you are entitled to it  you retain your first-time home buyer eligibility status for the future,btohqsg
Ok  were u not aware that your resale flat need to stay 5 yrs before balloting for new bto? Hence you were angry later that hdb cancelled your number,btohqsg
Hi  have they released the application for October BTO ?,btohqsg
Agree  just dont understand how hdb allowed it to happen  considered major lapse,btohqsg
So u bought ur resale without grant is it?,btohqsg
True. Its hdb fault. Back then maybe the system wasnt that advance. Now u cant even ballot if ur still under mop or receive que number within supply,btohqsg
Divorced senior wanna buy 2 room flexi  previous 3 room not sold and owned by ex spouse. Need to pay resale levy?,btohqsg
If the flat still under mop   means mop hasn't over yet   is the law u can't buy another flat. Is not hdb fault.,btohqsg
Two room studio like no need pay levy for previous flat  but I heard hmm need pay about 10k+- on top new flat price. Heard other seniors said  I not sure.,btohqsg
Hmm  I heard no need leh. Agent also say no need  but if the studio is 3rd attempt new flat  many senior say need pay about 10+k on top of the new flat cost. In this case  I not sure  best to check with hdb,btohqsg
I said its the system fault. The system not made by hdb meh? Lol,btohqsg
Anyone know how to see the next week bto is prime or prime plus location? Or have to wait for next week then know? Thanks.,btohqsg

hi i was shocked hdb cancel my June 24 bto for no reason. I went to HDB website under my profile and I saw. Was shocked to see. Can they just cancel without notifying me?,btohqsg
Nope  I gotten queue number but haven't been called up to choose unit,btohqsg
I don't understand why they cancel my application since already got queue number (within supply),btohqsg
I tried calling mainline but automated voice msg. Only open Mon-Fri during office hrs,btohqsg
I fulfilled MOP of 5yrs for my bto.  Jun 24 bto public queue starting 14 Oct,btohqsg
So not due to units all taken up,btohqsg
Does HDB have the right to just cancel my bto application without informing me even i have queue number (within supply)?,btohqsg
Hdb can check your history into their system. Hdb have the right. U can go down to check with the officer inchargd of Yr case. Call that officer if the letter got state their direct number,btohqsg
Ic  but not informing me of the reason is not acceptable. At the very least let me know why,btohqsg
What do you see in the hdb portal now?,btohqsg
If u click the red button on the right   no additional details?sorry I am not sure about your situation but  I believe HDB should be transparent about the cancellation,btohqsg
That's what i feel too. Hopefully it's technical or human error.,btohqsg
Yeah hope u get clarity on monday,btohqsg
Will try to log in again to see if there's any changes,btohqsg
Check your email or junk box,btohqsg
Checked. So far no email from HDB,btohqsg
Yea will keep checking. Maybe will send during weekdays?,btohqsg
