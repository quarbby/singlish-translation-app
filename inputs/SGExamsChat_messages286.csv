Yea the reddit thread for this was q fun,btohqsg
So ihave no time for tys,btohqsg
They still forcing u to do hw?,btohqsg
Like honestly self study is just way better,btohqsg
I focus more on tys . To be fair   I didn‚Äôt  focus on my science as much,btohqsg
Oh after June I stop doing the science papers they gave me,btohqsg
I rather pon school . Self studying is way more efficient,btohqsg
They said like the school would give 2 weeks to self study,btohqsg
But currently my school gave schedule for the last 2 weeks,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to sound insensitive but is your prelim score decent,btohqsg
All of em are 40+ and all failed except gor math,btohqsg
I am in the exact same boat as you . Floating to nowhere on a broken boat,btohqsg
Lol we just focus on tys,btohqsg
So if u ask me  doing tys may work last time. But now no. You should at least do one prelim paper1 to expose yourself.,btohqsg
I jait want to pass my science . Amath I might or not take the exam,btohqsg
I did total of 4 prelim papers practice before the prelim,btohqsg
Before 1 day i mainly do tys and got 60 overall,btohqsg
Prelim papers are to prepare for tricky questions i get it,btohqsg
Like to hit the higher band,btohqsg
About two weeks to o‚Äôs ...,btohqsg
Idk whether yr teacher show u this before for A math,btohqsg
If not i just stay home and study alr,btohqsg
The teachers say consultation open after 12,btohqsg
The moment i transfered here covid struck until now,btohqsg
Literally spent most of the time on zoom,btohqsg
I mean you can go for consult but no the 'classes' what,btohqsg
my form teacher damn strict if I don‚Äôt go surely call parents,btohqsg
I mean you just explain to your parents ah,btohqsg
My parents the type of parents to trust the teachers and I can‚Äôt skip 1 day of school,btohqsg
I guess you just weigh if its worth it ah like the consult.,btohqsg
Aight aight I‚Äôll see how it goes,btohqsg
There ‚Äòs a Meow on the left,btohqsg

Thats not how it works  but theres a strong correlation,btohqsg
Some dont even have tuition and could perform still,btohqsg
PLEASE IVE SEEN SOME SUPER SMART NEIGHBOUHOOD SCH PEOPLE,btohqsg
a lot of them are very motivated one,btohqsg
Sometimes cos of this I want to go back to communism,btohqsg
My sec sch friend went to HCI & RJ  from neighbourhood sch lmao,btohqsg
I mean idt communism is that bad,btohqsg
Is it all part of China,btohqsg
Meritocracy is a communism feature. Enjoy it,btohqsg
Ya look at china  ban kids from playing games and gg to tuition,btohqsg
communism all depends on the leader imo,btohqsg
xi jinping is maybe not so good but im sure we can come up w a better one maybe??,btohqsg

Technically u are giving tuition if u become a teacher,btohqsg
I do better in some subject than my frens who have tuition,btohqsg
But at the same they also do well,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just if u wan work for it anot,btohqsg
Why get tuition when you can just use intuition,btohqsg
thats when the real bell curves come,btohqsg
Why tuition when u can whack,btohqsg
if one is not diligent enough  its becomes a necessity to compete with those who dont need it,btohqsg
I mean idt its a necessity still.. because you identified the problem. So the solution can be being more diligent,btohqsg
But all schs are lousy schs,btohqsg
If all schools are lousy schools then all exam papers will be lousy papers init? haha,btohqsg
diligent is a skill liao. some oso are late bloomers (like me) so having tuition is to like compensate ur lag in growth liddat,btohqsg
My dnt Cher was talking about RI,btohqsg
Honestly idk how anyone can do tuition and jc at the same time,btohqsg
all schools are lousy  all schools are good. whats the benchmark? thats up to u,btohqsg
huh no LMAO  i just got lucky my breakthrough happened in sec 3,btohqsg
Ig they trying to say that a levels is shit and ib is superior,btohqsg
thats biased against those who is good in MT and PW,btohqsg
All schools are lousy  some are lousier than others,btohqsg
not like PW actually gives proper learning experience LMAO. what did i went thru sia,btohqsg
Madarin is not my mt my mt is hokkien,btohqsg
to me it did so to each their own,btohqsg
i think a lvl pw less toxic than uni,btohqsg
PW is teacher diff so if ur teacher is good then u will have learnt something,btohqsg
uni one is a whole new level,btohqsg
all the useless people start appearing,btohqsg
It taught me to bullshit words thou,btohqsg
my one literally throws work  nvr see our progress till the end,btohqsg
a lvl pw is alr structured in a sense that even the lazy ppl have to do something,btohqsg
and how to cope with it,btohqsg
why doesnt pw give C D E S U?,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they give C,btohqsg

hi does anybody know for h2 math how much we need to get in tys to get an A in a levels?,btohqsg
There's no definite mark? cause the difficulty of the paper differs from year to year .-. and therefore the grade boundaries.,btohqsg
Instead  grading takes into consideration various factors such as the paper difficulty and the quality of candidates‚Äô work so as to maintain standards.‚Äù,btohqsg
plus i private candidate and this year is my first year i take H2 math,btohqsg
Yes but I'd say 75-79 for H2 Math?,btohqsg
Ye it acts on a normal distribution still against paper diffiuclty,btohqsg
It kinda is if u think abt it,btohqsg
But % of grades will be dependent on their side ah,btohqsg
There should be a benchmark on the paper,btohqsg
If still insecure  aim 80 boom ez clap,btohqsg
What are ur trying to do?,btohqsg
Can you guys do this with Java code?,btohqsg

Play with something. A ball  a pen  or walk walk around,btohqsg
i find screaming into a pillow helps too,btohqsg
go for a walk  drink water  take deep breaths,btohqsg
Actually I am the one who is panicking,btohqsg
You drink water daily. Water is H2O. You need oxygen. It‚Äôs O2,btohqsg
Chemistry die. You die  I die  everybody die,btohqsg

How much content can I do within the span of 19 days,btohqsg
there's always resits for O-Levels next year.,btohqsg
Erm  do you planning to do STEM?,btohqsg
Then I'm sure that O Level Chem wouldn't effect that much.,btohqsg
Erm  have you tried doing IGCSE/O-Level past year papers from 2018 to 2021?,btohqsg
after mugging finished your own TYS.,btohqsg
have you read the examiner report on the poorly answered questions?,btohqsg
International O-Levels / IGCSE papers. Not your local Singapore's O Level variant papers.,btohqsg
those papers are generally much easier to score.,btohqsg
Is it possible to cover content within 19 days,btohqsg
Cause it been stressing me out,btohqsg
if you have done revising for all topics  I think doing Actual Cambridge Papers would help.,btohqsg
Afterall it is not some hard arse weird prelim paper.,btohqsg
I think prelim papers should suffice,btohqsg
I am not willing to go the extra mile,btohqsg
but not up to Cambridge's standards.,btohqsg
just time yourself when you solve each question,btohqsg
I hope to pass chemistry. I got a whopping e8 ...,btohqsg
Could I jump to an b3? Hahahaha,btohqsg
