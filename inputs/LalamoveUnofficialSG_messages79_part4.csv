One angry new F&B ownerFrom Dr. Chee Soon Juan Facebook:I‚Äôve said it before  and I‚Äôll say it again. The PAP‚Äôs incompetence and one-step-behind-the-curve reaction in the on-going pandemic is making life a misery for Singaporeans.In the latest round of surge in infections  how on earth did KTVs ‚Äì with all their attendant illicit services ‚Äì mask themselves as legitimate F&B outlets? And apparently  it‚Äôs not just one or two rogue outlets but scores of them.And when the no. of infections explode  the government reacts by placing onerous and  frankly  quite silly restrictions on legitimate eateries and restaurants.The latest restrictions defy common sense. You can have up to 5 diners but‚Ä¶ Parents can dine in with their children but‚Ä¶ Diners must be fully vaccinated but‚Ä¶Seriously?Then they relax rules allowing up to 5 diners  then the no. of cases go up  then they say that they are unlike to revert to more stringent rules  then one week later  they do a U-turn and tighten the rules again. How do you run a business when the rules keep changing?This is what happens when you have generals and scholars sitting in their air-conditioned offices and putting pen to paper with nary any experience on the ground  making rules on the fly.At one point  they decreed that mum and dad with infant cannot sit together at one table because the limit is two and two only. We‚Äôve had to seat such ‚Äúgroups‚Äù of three separately where mum and baby sat at one end of the caf√© and dad at the other. At the end  of the meal they get up and go home together.Make rules that make sense  is all people ask.In the meantime  legitimate F&B outlets are reeling  real businesses are destroyed  real jobs are lost and real Singaporeans are hurting.My friends  don‚Äôt let the silliness of our young ministers deter you from supporting our local restaurants. Now more than ever  they need your support. Follow the rules (bizarre as they are)  but go out and have a meal.Have a good week ahead  everyone.,btohqsg
Chee soon Juan aso suay now open cafe,btohqsg
follow malaisia mah buka tutup buka then tutup again,btohqsg
