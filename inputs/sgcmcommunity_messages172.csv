my friend bought his A5 2 years ago at 150k...,btohqsg
Need to start saving for downpayment,btohqsg
I wanted to trade in for 2nd hand Hyundai Hybrid,btohqsg
Guai guai drive till COE up better,btohqsg
I can drive till 2033 at least,btohqsg
I wonder who is the leader,btohqsg
Just wanna ask the drivers here on this issue about road hogging‚Ä¶Scenario:Car A is traveling on PIE lane 1 within speed limit of 90kph while lane 2 is relatively empty. Car B appears behind Car A with the intention to overtake. Car A refuses to budge and continues cruising on lane 1  preventing Car B from overtaking  with the mentality that he is not breaking any traffic rules and Car B should not be speeding above the speed limit.,btohqsg
Why can't Car B overtake via lane 2 then?,btohqsg
That would be undertaking  which means breaking traffic rules,btohqsg
I know this has been debated since the beginning of time,btohqsg
Scenario will be different if lane 2 is Occupied,btohqsg
Right most lane is for over taking  meaning after over taking  should go back to middle lane. Many drivers just plain ignorant or inconsiderate,btohqsg
Yes but still Car A can proceed further till there is an opening to filter,btohqsg
Precisely. Many assume they can travel at speed limit on lane 1 all the way from Changi to Tuas,btohqsg
So speeding or not or under 90 or not is not the issue here  its whether the fella is done overtaking  if yes should f off the right lane ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
If I am Car B  I will just use Lane 2 to overtake,btohqsg
I know Car A has not broken any traffic rules but it is more of common road courtesy,btohqsg
Since Car A is so called road hogging....hahaha,btohqsg
I do that sometimes when the ignorant driver in front refuses to budge,btohqsg
So why must tailgate Car A then,btohqsg
Car B will never be at fault as long as car A is road hogging,btohqsg
We see many of such scenarios daily.,btohqsg
U can always use lane 2 to drive all the way further up......hahahahaha...then once far enough  use lane 1 lahhhhh,btohqsg
If u are slow let other faster drivers go,btohqsg
Some drivers believe at 90kph they are not road hogging lane 1,btohqsg
These ppl deserve the high beam,btohqsg
I was on cte at 2am and a taxi was on the first lane doing 90,btohqsg
I can be driving at 120kph on lane 1 and another car comes behind me at 150kph. I will still be road hogging,btohqsg
I flash him he still dare to on his rear fog lights,btohqsg
So moral of the story: go and install those HID lights and make sure u beam those road hoggers at lane 1! Hahaha...just joking,btohqsg
Yes. Must make sure they know got ppl behind them,btohqsg
They can try this on the north south highway and see what happens when a msia car tailgates u for road hogging,btohqsg
I smell more money for me ah hehehe,btohqsg
‚ÄúOops sorry got car jam brake infront of me so I no choice oso have to brake‚Äù,btohqsg
Sometimes those lane 4 or 5 are of much better cleared lanes,btohqsg
Problem is not with how fast or slow u are occupying lane 1. Is whether u giveway to cars coming from behind at a higher speed,btohqsg
Cause some car better at faster speeds. Usually faster lanes smoother less speed changing which consumes more petrol to keep let go gas and step again,btohqsg
Many drivers are too self entitled to think this way,btohqsg
I will sometimes cruise on lane 1 at speed limit but when i see another car behind almost tailgating. I will filter left to allow him to pass,btohqsg
If want to overtake so much ....then use road shoulder .....hahahahaha,btohqsg
Many assume that since it is not breaking any traffic rules. They continue to hog lane 1 at 90kph,btohqsg
In e eyes of law  no wrong. But its damn wrong in the eyes of a human being,btohqsg
Cannot la unless u ambulance or TP. Lane 1 is supposedly overtaking lane,btohqsg
Ya la legally no wrong that is why many still hog mah,btohqsg
Thta y i dont bother signal right,btohqsg
Why bother to beam  signal n tail,btohqsg
Same as when come to merging lanes,btohqsg
Sometimes dont even need to wait till behind,btohqsg
Aiyoh dont anyhow teach wrong thing leh,btohqsg
Frm far U aga aga knw tht lane 1 fella is slow,btohqsg
Undertaking by right cannot but by left no choice at times,btohqsg
But it's the fact....u still want to tailgate at lane 1 mehh??????,btohqsg
So frm far just go lane 2 3 or even 4 to overtake lor,btohqsg
I wont. But many do as can be seen in multiple online videos,btohqsg
No one say u cannot drive 90 on lane 2 3 4,btohqsg
U drive 90 on lane 4 u cry,btohqsg
Cos lane 4 most only max 50,btohqsg
U knw on CTE lane 4 is the fastest lane during peak hour?,btohqsg
I mean those cars traveling on lane 4 going v slow la,btohqsg
That's why I said earlier....sometimes lane 4 or 5 us much of better clearance ...hahaha,btohqsg
Lane 4 on CTE towrds town after the PIE exit is the fastest,btohqsg
U can easily gain 400-800m ahead of Lane 1 n 2,btohqsg
Haha ya fast until u reach balestier,btohqsg
By then u alrdy miles ahead of cars in Lane 1,btohqsg
By then u shld cut into lane 2 n 3 alrdy,btohqsg
I remembered i saw one fella emailed lta or what,btohqsg
U want many many Mike's ahead  u use road shoulder....hahaha,btohqsg
Go lane 1 on peak is suicide,btohqsg
Ya la LTA say not breaking traffic rules even if u going 90kph on lane 1. Unless u going 60 and below,btohqsg
Ya and high chance of chain collision also,btohqsg
Cannot imagine 60km and below...wah piang!,btohqsg
Entire PIE n CTE is 80 n 90,btohqsg
Thats why its called road hogging mah,btohqsg
Even if you drive speed limit,btohqsg
Road hogging is still road hogging,btohqsg
If you see cars overtake you while in you‚Äôre in lane 1,btohqsg
But road hogging mostly on lane 1. If u travel 60 on the other lanes is not hogging leh,btohqsg
This will be best if driver has common sense,btohqsg
Entire lane 1 overtake him  he still slowly drove,btohqsg
The outer (right-hand) lane is for overtaking only; do not stay in it longer than necessary after overtaking vehicles in the centre lane. --> Singapore Statues alr say 1ST LANE FOR OVERTAKING ONLY. OVERTAKE ALR GO BACK 2ND. ITS NOT THAT DIFFICULT.,btohqsg
Cause lane 1 considered ‚Äúfast lane‚Äù mah,btohqsg
Yea  i drive lane 1 to overtake people on lane 2,btohqsg
So just overtake lane 2 or 3 lor,btohqsg
But many dont think so. They believe if they travel at speed limit. They are not wrong,btohqsg
I drive lane 2 to overtake lane 1,btohqsg
They will only give way if u are ambulance or TP,btohqsg
Lol got 1 video this vezel dont give way for TP,btohqsg
So this is more about common road courtesy than traffic rules,btohqsg
TP on blinker also never move,btohqsg
Conclusion: if I am car B  I will just use Lane 2 and whacked further then use Lane 1....by then  Car A can smell my exhaust liaooo,btohqsg
Exactly but do so without TP catching,btohqsg
yeap msia they see u faster they just give way,btohqsg
not like SG  taxi uncle driving 70 on a 90 lane 1,btohqsg
Yes they practise this very well,btohqsg
After i filter the msia car show me his finger,btohqsg
Cos it is unwritten rule to them that u giveway to faster cars coming from behind,btohqsg
But very different here in sg,btohqsg
I think i will also show u finger,btohqsg
dun show finger in SG lah,btohqsg
will kena charged for road rage one,btohqsg
usually i just turn my head stare at them and drive off,btohqsg
Show thumb can or not??? Hahaha,btohqsg
All die die must be infront,btohqsg
Even if car behind u die die must squeeze in the narrow gap,btohqsg
I saw one taxi speed past me nearly strike the kerb jus to merge into my lane,btohqsg
I just dont understand why. Can save how many minutes or seconds?,btohqsg
U risk it just to save a few seconds but if you fail. U end up losing money,btohqsg
U let the car further infront of u proceed first,btohqsg
Is not cannot. Is they don‚Äôt wan to,btohqsg
Maybe cos our sg cars too expensive,btohqsg
I ever even kena horn by taxi behind for allowing a car beside to filter infront of me,btohqsg
It‚Äôs always the taxis hor I realize,btohqsg
Haha now pte hire cars also sharing the prize liao,btohqsg
All sohai hog first lane and still cannot keep to lane,btohqsg
Will anyhow in and out de,btohqsg
They wanna get ahead to the front like Hamilton,btohqsg
But sian can‚Äôt do anything. I p plate. They more senior I must let them go,btohqsg

Safe to say p plate can be removed in Dec of this year,btohqsg
Whats worst thn lane 1 hogger,btohqsg
ppl who dont signal and merge into ur lane/ people who cannot keep in lane,btohqsg
Stuck in lane 2 and lane 3 4 n 1 faster thn u,btohqsg
People who slam on their brakes on a full throttle corner.,btohqsg
This one biggest clown on the road,btohqsg
Or roundabout drive at 30km/hr lol,btohqsg
But u got the energy to?,btohqsg

Dealing w nonsensical customers is another,btohqsg
Think can take corner then jam brake when cornering,btohqsg
Ppl who do dis.. god bless SKIDDING,btohqsg
Not so easy skid ah  some part of our road like really rough,btohqsg
Key is  just drive n swallow pride,btohqsg
Yes sir yes sir 3 bags full,btohqsg

I need $700k loan to buy a m3 Touring,btohqsg
can i get big loan for genshin,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise given the current market condition  is it worth it to sell current car and get a bigger car? I‚Äôm on a Yaris cross xb 2021,btohqsg
Short answer is yes. U could potentially get a bigger car and still pay the same depre/monthly loans. I assume your coe is about 60k? Compared to 100 now. U already have quite a bit of buffer,btohqsg
Really need the car? If no  just sell it and profit! üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Extra money u earned will n thrown back into the car,btohqsg
And with the insane increase in car prices  ur loan to debt ratio might change if ur salary nvr increase. Might have trouble getting bank loan,btohqsg
2021 XB 2nd selling at 110-120k,btohqsg
I believe u bought at ard 90-100k?,btohqsg
More like taking back the mthly loan he paid,btohqsg
I just sold my yaris cross XB 2021 and bought a used nissan qashqai left with 3y6m. My strategy is to wait for coe to drop. Now is the best time to sell your current car at high price and take back cash. My installment only increase by $180 yet I enjoy a bigger car with more comfort than yaris cross. No regret at all.,btohqsg
Sell earn 28k no point lah,btohqsg
I got 8 years left. Any advice which car can I get for more space and don‚Äôt need top up monthly too much?,btohqsg
But my loan % is only 1.68% now like 2.5+  still make sense?,btohqsg
COE is a 10 years cycle thingy. It will likely drop but not down to 40-50k. I guess the range will be between 60k - 70k. Think are getting expensive with high inflation likewise for vehicle.,btohqsg
We r no longer in the olden days.,btohqsg
New diesel cars will b gone in 2025 iirc. There will be another wave of ppl rushing to buy cars.Electric cars r slowly being replaced. Another wave.VES rebates will be removed. Another wave to buy before no more rebates,btohqsg
Wa  I didn't know Yaris cross is smaller than Nishant QQ (2.0L?). I thought they same size,btohqsg
When the time comes for no more petrol  that last few years before tht  will be another wave to buy a last batch of petrol cars,btohqsg
Dealers now r offering guranteed COE w no top up,btohqsg
My whole area only have 3 charger to service like 10+ HDB blocks. The pick up rate is still CMI üíÄ,btohqsg
PHVs will keep COEs above 100Ks for CAT A,btohqsg
I really don‚Äôt like EVs‚Ä¶ üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Guranteed coe will push it sky high,btohqsg
Now u cant find salesman offering 3 biddings liao,btohqsg
Now straight up frnt tell u gurantee coe,btohqsg
So‚Ä¶ change or don‚Äôt change? Haha jin confusing,btohqsg
Ya much more smaller in term of cabin size. Yaris cross is not suitable for family though it saves fuel and reliability.,btohqsg
Decent engh for a small family of 3,btohqsg
Want to full load  forget it,btohqsg
Is not a safe vehicle too. Try press the car door and you will know the reason. Lol.,btohqsg
Damn. I was thinking to change my Altis to a cross over SUV when Coe drop next time. I thought Yaris cross is a good alternative to the corolla cross,btohqsg
Dun change if you are comfortable with the car. For me  the car has too many shortcoming,btohqsg
Is it for new driver  the car insurance will be more expensive since prior no track records to prove safety and no claim?,btohqsg
Wife say cabin very squeezy with baby chair. Then asking if good opportunity to change,btohqsg
For CAT A cross over Vezel is popular  but the size different when I see online like not much different. Unless you willing to change to a cat B suv with a lesser lease then I think got worth. If change to another cat A cross over like not much changes in the space,btohqsg
You changing to new or used car?,btohqsg
I wld choose a Mazda6 over Camry,btohqsg
Space wise when I sit in at the back of cross,btohqsg
Current market  better buy used car. Next time coe drop  you will loss alot.,btohqsg
Or new vezel it's definitely feel shorter n smaller,btohqsg
To me car is cheap expensive is that paper or right to use,btohqsg
If really want space  Honda Shuttle,btohqsg
I feel its a super underrated car,btohqsg
Cost 20k more compared to a Mazda 6,btohqsg
I think toyota is just overpriced now,btohqsg
Can cut cost for something similar w size n boot,btohqsg
I think you meant COE. (lol),btohqsg
Okay lah same same but even before coe hike i feel its abit overpriced,btohqsg
But Mazda 6 has no hybrid....I think...,btohqsg
With ur current car interest rate so low  now abt 2.98% ur paying more,btohqsg
U earn 20k to pay more interest over the same period,btohqsg
Just stick with ur current car until one more baby comes out,btohqsg
I assume now is only one child based on what u say ah,btohqsg
Felt it look better thn current Camry,btohqsg
Hybrid is gonna hurt your wallet,btohqsg
I mean when u drive until u need replace the hybrid battery,btohqsg
Feels like its gna cost more than ur,btohqsg
Imagine you need to change battery and overhaul,btohqsg
Batteries they dont change the entire thing,btohqsg
Now they scan n replace or repair the affected cell,btohqsg
Full petrol is the way to go,btohqsg
Yes correct. Wife say if 1 more baby the car seat put where if stick with Yaris cross ü§£,btohqsg
So we shld beat them to assert dominance,btohqsg
5 reacts and I‚Äôll beat my wife to assert dominance,btohqsg
I want u to suk my kok,btohqsg
yesterday pump petrol then today price drop lol,btohqsg
ReportedImh neuro specialist (deputy director)[6013751794] to admins.,btohqsg
are Peugeot's really that bad reliability wise?,btohqsg
Google said can use for 15 years,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt like to drive car leh. I prefer to ride my bike. The car really is for chauffeuring the wife and kid around only,btohqsg
which model? I'm looking at 3008,btohqsg
Click on the button to see the chat rules!,btohqsg
deep pocket or not now got many better choices also,btohqsg
korean/chinese best CP.... even though the C right now is atrocious,btohqsg
I saw receipts from servicing and they were rather expensive. Lots of small things to fix. Not just the usual oil change.,btohqsg
So the sceptic in me is thinking if I buy this car I will also end up forking out $$$$ to maintain,btohqsg
Service history usually good  but I've never seen such a long list of fixes on a parf car before,btohqsg
The signs all there. Usually first few years warranty when they do servicing  got errors will fix for you the parts that are faulty.,btohqsg
The only anomaly is BMW. First 5 years keep claiming warranty but people still keep buying,btohqsg
How abt 2009 c180? Can buy? üòÅ,btohqsg
Because sheer driving pleasure. Amongst the 3 Germans  bmw offers the best driving feel. Reliability is Heng suay.,btohqsg
90% of singaporeans who buy bmw don't care about driving pleasure... brand more important,btohqsg
If brand  merc is more prestigious.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why so many glb and glc on the road,btohqsg
No need. 116 or a180 both have the badge can liao already better than Camry or Mazda 6 etc,btohqsg
Ya but ride quality is like crap,btohqsg
I think 2 years ago there was Peugeot 508 fastback,btohqsg
Can buy any car you want,btohqsg
Just that some require more maintenance than other cars,btohqsg
You find someone willing to sell you,btohqsg
Sir.. I want GT3rs.. wissach pack .. can ?,btohqsg
can. you order and pay the downpayment i will pay the rest,btohqsg
wow amazing! Not only did you score an ultra rare car  you even managed to get it approved in singapore despite it being left hand drive!!! You guys are amazing!!!,btohqsg
do share your secrets with us!! Is lee hsien loong your friend? Did you bribe someone at LTA? Do tell,btohqsg
Might be seeing aggressive bidding alr,btohqsg
But car sharing also increases probability and risks of accidents considering the fact that the occasional driver would have access to car more easily and probably would care less too ü§î,btohqsg
I mean  consider the amount of accidents involving a getgo,btohqsg
Seeing how most getgos are so banged up,btohqsg
Maybe need ruling of only those who live in property costing 5 million and above can own car. The rest of cars all convert to car sharing.,btohqsg
Some ppl like seeing a revolution,btohqsg
The article is from getgo perspective...car sharing boss won't say its better to own a car üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Car owning is not only costs factor  other factors also e.g. independence  privacy etc. If cost is the only factor  the person won't even buy car in the first place. So there's nothing new in such article,btohqsg
So glad you're not the policymaker,btohqsg
Renters not seasoned driver  car type is always different and requires different estimation and judgement  rookies where got the skill?? The only skills they have is blaming others,btohqsg
Maybe if masses move to mopeds,btohqsg
Cars don't make much sense liao,btohqsg
Some ulu places really more accessible with cars,btohqsg
Cuzco u don't stay in a property with more then 5mill,btohqsg
About this scenario  if you overtake at 120kmh at lane 1 cause all the lane 2 vehicles maintaining at 90. And you continue all the way for a long stretch at 110 120 kmh cause...for u to slot back into lane 2 u have to slow down to 90. Are you illegally speeding?,btohqsg
Or high speeds are excusable cause you are in theory overtaking from say whiteley road to tampines exit,btohqsg
So u shld b doing 90 at lane 2 also,btohqsg
But pple think they driving to overtake so can go 100 110 on lane 1,btohqsg
So if TP at lane 2 on 90  u gg to speed up to overtake?,btohqsg
Or tp on 90 at lane 1  u gg to high beam n tail him?,btohqsg
If you're going at 100 to overtake I think tp will just close one eye,btohqsg
They will on blinker n pull u over,btohqsg
Means ideally lane 1 shld be empty. Lane 2 shld be 80 to 90. Lane 1 shld only use for overtake at max 90kmh speed. Then form back up in lane 2 at 80kmh.,btohqsg
But I challenge you to try to high beam and tailgate tp,btohqsg
Remember to share your dashcam footage,btohqsg
1sr qn they asked me was what's the speed limit,btohqsg
Some of those foreign Sohai will do this. Proud ego,btohqsg
Then he asked me  and then?,btohqsg
Wah they sia lan ask and then....,btohqsg
U do wrong u still yaya meh,btohqsg
Hehe only they got power to yaya,btohqsg
Show me radar reading. Kana at 96,btohqsg
Thts a demerit pt + fine,btohqsg
U kana overhead bridge sniper also will receive love letter,btohqsg
Basically all these pple driving  when no tp very fast all will get caught if scanned n caught,btohqsg
Do no if erp 2.0 will monitor ur speed. Less speeding driver less accidents safer roads,btohqsg
U speed straight away ur cash card minus,btohqsg
If nt why u think all hum ji in frnt of speed cam,btohqsg
Since its 'ok' to drive faster to overtake,btohqsg
I better go calibrate my speedo with my GPS,btohqsg
U try over take in frnt of speed cam abv 90,btohqsg
Running size 55 instead of 50 profile,btohqsg
No allowance on the speed? Like speed limits 90 even go 91-92 will kena letter by overhead speed camera?,btohqsg
Saying we cud have fined but not,btohqsg
Erp  2.0 if catch speeding will be ultimate.ccan save so much manpower on patrolling highway. Just send out letters automatically.,btohqsg
Usually... just saying  if sniper catch u means u gg over ur speedo,btohqsg
My K3  speedo is abt -8,btohqsg
Do 100  actual speed is abt 92 93,btohqsg
So to get caught  means 100% speeding,btohqsg
How to tell if my car speedo is + or - lol.,btohqsg
Use GPS. Go on straight rd. Set cruise control at 90,btohqsg
Then u see speedo vs gps,btohqsg
What's the shop in sin ming that duplicates key fob? I'm considering duplicating a 2014 altis keyless entry/start stop type,btohqsg
Iirc  u buy frm them  installation is free,btohqsg
Cam wise see what brand u buy lor,btohqsg
Singtrade i think they have korean brands  iroad,btohqsg
If u want blackvue  go their AD at batok,btohqsg
Carousel got seller sell the 70 mai. They can do home installation also,btohqsg
I bet this clown got his own car,btohqsg
parf vs coe car  does parf work out cheaper when you consider fuel economy and insurance? or not such a big deal?,btohqsg
I'm realizing a lot of coe cars v poor fuel economy,btohqsg
Fuel economy is dependent on how heavy ur foot is,btohqsg
Of cus lah  ur engine how old alr,btohqsg
Got do overhaul or walnut blasting boh,btohqsg
insurance naturally more exp lo bopian,btohqsg
Getgo is also owned by a car dealer,btohqsg
Getgo is motoreast son‚Äôs idea iirc,btohqsg
all these car sharing seems like a success cause of the high coe,btohqsg
waiting for coe to drop is like waiting for sg to snow,btohqsg
Will reach saturation level one la  eventually it will plateau to a certain level and be consistent there,btohqsg
U want to do bo ?,btohqsg
I want to top overhaul and change crankshaft.,btohqsg
Huh ur car got problem meh,btohqsg
Some v good some v bad,btohqsg
I previously drove a 2008 toyota allion from2020-2023  always averaged 15KM/L,btohqsg
Lancer cs3 in comparison more like 10-11km/l,btohqsg
Hope to get some advice. I sold my car a few months back. Am I able to cancel the car insurance and get a refund?,btohqsg
You get the money back on the months you never use,btohqsg
A few months ago abit hard,btohqsg
Usually they give like 1 month buffer,btohqsg
You go contact your insurance asap,btohqsg
If like 8 months left  maybe give u back rebate 6 months that kind,btohqsg
No ah  they give you 8,btohqsg
Depends case by case for company,btohqsg
Just give them a call  they‚Äôll try to settle it for you,btohqsg
Need to submit a form. Iirc  its the LTA transfer cert,btohqsg
Thank for all the info and advice :),btohqsg
Yah just claw back whatever amt u get,btohqsg
I remember they will give u abit penalty if u end early,btohqsg
80% of the total amt  so wont be full 8 months if u sell at the 4th month,btohqsg
When ntuc gimme back wasnt full 8 months de,btohqsg
Lemme see if I can find the letter,btohqsg
where's a good place to do matt for the car?,btohqsg
no i mean instead of paint  do matt over,btohqsg
but which one is most recommended,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the after care that‚Äôs important,btohqsg
Wrapping a car can never always be 100% one,btohqsg
After a week or two confirm can see imperfections,btohqsg
Then see the shop want to rectify anot,btohqsg
so in other words  non lasting,btohqsg
i wanted to save all my polishing costs and transferred that to wrap instead,btohqsg
thanks a lot bros for the various tips,btohqsg
Wrap alr still must wax or ceramic coat one,btohqsg
the problem w wrap if its damaged  must rewrap  cannot like paint job putty back n spray over,btohqsg
but wrap good thing is keep original paint,btohqsg
If u wanna change color without removing original color,btohqsg
at the same time it is easier to change a panel of wrap compared to painting a whole panel,btohqsg
Also don't have to worry about bad jobs on maintaining lines of the body panels and workmanship with filler,btohqsg
Good morning! What is make  model and age of your car?,btohqsg
go to your usual workshop should be ok,btohqsg
likely a faulty o2 sensor  cat con issue or exhaust manifold leak,btohqsg
I read somewhere  once u wrap  u wrap for life cos when u remove the wrap  the original paintwork comes off with it...üòÅ,btohqsg
it depends on what kind of wrap you're getting,btohqsg
get something good like Avery Denison  Inozetek  etc. and it'll come off easy and likely leave no residual glue,btohqsg
Wrap is one of those things that you can‚Äôt cheap out,btohqsg
Yupp  I'm sure Mr Eric with his love for chemical guys would know too!,btohqsg
I like chemical guys cause they got washing stuffs for matte wraps,btohqsg
And depends on e skill of the person removing the wrap,btohqsg
Really heat gun all e way or spot heating then pull,btohqsg
If applied right and good quality wrap,btohqsg
If wrap with colour / pattern need to let LTA know?,btohqsg
Likely causes given the age! But if younger hor‚Ä¶ maybe should just put back the cat converters ü§™,btohqsg
They earn alot by scamming people like you,btohqsg
"Cos some would recommend expensive options when regular would do  or ""keep a stroke"" and have you keep coming back",btohqsg
Before the rental and PHV stuff  those who have cars tend to be more well to do. These people will just agree to whatever AD charge as long the car keep running smoothly. Some of the workshop follow this trend and can earn quite well.,btohqsg
Hi guys. Just to ask. Is there any shop i can place my car for leasing? Where they will undertake the instalment and repair?,btohqsg

I have claim one with in this year   so if I change to another insurer the ncd will reduced even I have ncd protector,btohqsg
U need to ask the other insurer of they accept,btohqsg
I try to do online those forms.,btohqsg
So better to stay with current inusrer,btohqsg
actually just see premium cost with another?,btohqsg
I was not sure how the ncd protector works. I check with direct Asia   they say if u have a claim   the ncd will be different,btohqsg
If you have 50% it‚Äôll only drop to 20%,btohqsg
Some might take ur full protected ncd. But charge u higher premium,btohqsg
Its w insurer A. Insurer B might not honor,btohqsg
Thts if u renew w your original insurer. Then ur 50% is protected,btohqsg
If I change insurance company  means the ncd will drop,btohqsg
If u renew with them  u check how much is ur prem vs taking a new one,btohqsg
All higher than current one. Cos of the ncd not 50%,btohqsg
Cfm change of insurer will be 20% ncd,btohqsg

Is signing AA singapore good? Under what circumstances would joining AA be good?,btohqsg
