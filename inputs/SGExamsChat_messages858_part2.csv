Looks like nus for eg tries to maintain 50:50 males and females,btohqsg
So as a guy it's tough ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Isn't it roughly there based on their published stats,btohqsg
I'll quote the word  roughly there,btohqsg
because published stats are just for personal reference,btohqsg
Yea but afaik most guys already applied,btohqsg
So I wonder if they keep any slots open for people who apply towards end of ns or not,btohqsg
iirc from word of mout  unis will mostly prioritise male applicants who have finished serving 2-Yrs of mandated NS,btohqsg
the 50:50 gender ratio is honestly a misconception tho,btohqsg
a misconception that existed many years ago,btohqsg
It also depends on how well applicants portray themselves in applications,btohqsg
Also a question for how would students craft their portfolios,btohqsg
not just those currently in studiesalso applies to those adult learners who are wanting to upskill,btohqsg
How can one make their application and portfolio better,btohqsg
As far as I've seen there's a few short answer questions only and can fill up academic grades and achievements,btohqsg
i think i wrote carousel seller on my linkedln. learnt communicating with buyers and marketing skills LMAO,btohqsg
at this stage  it's quite hard,btohqsg
In terms of like writing and crafting it?,btohqsg
imo  the section on academic grades & achievements isn't always about school,btohqsg
it could be skill-relared  course-related or smth,btohqsg
"its mostly just categorised under ""academic"" because you're applying for potential further studies",btohqsg
types of academic grades are specified.,btohqsg
Is it realistic to get mech e with low rp ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Yes  it's undeniable that you need to meet certain criteria/requirements for specified subjects,btohqsg
just check the cut-off RP points listed lor,btohqsg
"Tbh it rlly depends on your definition of ""low"" rp",btohqsg
i mean we got ntu aero falling 11.25 rp in one year bef,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will change it tho,btohqsg
Tbh i expected it to be much more competitive,btohqsg
Cus now the H1 contrasting subject doesnt have to be part of the rp,btohqsg
Which tbh among those who took the most non hybrid combis  they wld usually say is the subject they dont like/cmi at,btohqsg
So the only determining factor left would most likely be general paper,btohqsg
Mmm wld say probably  but unis tend to look at results first,btohqsg
But then now more ppl wld have max rp,btohqsg
if there are many 70rp ... hmm,btohqsg
i mean it's hard to say anything rn,btohqsg
They set the h2 syllabus harder,btohqsg
first batch is always the guinea pig,btohqsg
H2 Physics syllabus now got capacitence  quantum particle in a box  wavefunctions,btohqsg
I also wonder if they might instead make it harder to score an A,btohqsg
h2 phy now also got excel or smth,btohqsg
H2 Chem got nanomaterials and idk that is the only one i observed so far.,btohqsg
But wld say i prefer excel over drawing a stupid table.,btohqsg
This yrs A lvl first batch right?,btohqsg
eh the excel thing is genuinely good,btohqsg
More following the trends of current times,btohqsg
For those that did it with no excel  i.e. previous batches  they are only required to do 6 plot pointd,btohqsg
Idk if the excel one wld make them do like.,btohqsg
oh wait do we actually use laptops/etc.?,btohqsg
Idk what is their new conditiins,btohqsg
