If someone were to  made a mistake once  will you just have a bad impression on him/her and stop talking to him/her?,btohqsg
It would depend on the mistake and how they act after knowing that they have committed the mistake.,btohqsg

Mistake : scamming people money and the act is : learn from their mistake.,btohqsg
If they repent upon their mistake  it's only merciful if we give them a second chance.Yet if they repeat all the time  you can choose to be by their side to help them or you can choose to wish the best for them and bid them farewell without any animosity towards them.,btohqsg
