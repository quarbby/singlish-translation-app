Because of this mindset  he will definitely advertise here,btohqsg
"Fun can be defined in many ways. I like to say fun always depends on the driver  the car can only elevate the experience. Have you ever felt slow while in some form of another racing other cars? That feeling of being underpowered relative to your friends.. if you have? The urge to prove that you can catch up in a slow car is fun.Do you think my suzuki swift can go beat everybody on the roads? Do you think the swift is actly faster than my volvo? It isnt  the volvo is actly 2 times faster in terms of horsepower and 3+ times in terms of torque. But each time i get into the swift it just feels fun to ""take the apex"" and link the flowing corners.",btohqsg
Wah suddenly come out one paragraph,btohqsg
Also waste time typing all that for him,btohqsg
You write for me better ü§≠,btohqsg
i dont ever think its a waste of time. If he is so close minded  its a good time for me to be nice and explain rationally in hopes that he will learn to look at things from a multi perspective point of view. If he is intentionally annoying people  then up to him lor  i still live happily ever after... w my shitbox swiftüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

I feel like y'all trolling at this point switching names,btohqsg
Please don't go sepang and roll it,btohqsg
U mean small cars more manoeuvrable issit? That‚Äôs y fun?,btohqsg
nope  it just feels lighter and have better steering feedback,btohqsg
idk how to explain better due to my lack of vocabulary  maybe i can bring you on a joyride soon?,btohqsg
We also hv 911 made of cf super light n hv great steering,btohqsg
But how can u compare 911 with small cars?,btohqsg
911 is made for it with so much engineering and tech in mind. You think the swift has this much tech instilled into the car,btohqsg
the car has rear drum brakes man,btohqsg
exactly look at the diff price point,btohqsg
In the first place  it‚Äôs already very malu to even drive swift,btohqsg
cheap is not a good indicator of how good a car is lor,btohqsg
but i agree swift as a family car very small,btohqsg
luckily it primarily fetches 2 ppl only,btohqsg
still have the XC40 if need to fetch the whole family,btohqsg
OK for humans if you don't need to carry a lot of stuff tho. Took a grab in the new swift mild hybrid. Completely surprised by the rear leg space...,btohqsg
The shape  size n engine. Almost everything sia,btohqsg
but imagne carryinf a family of 4+ grocceries,btohqsg
Haha thankfully ntuc is nearer to my house than my carpark so almost never happens to me,btohqsg
yep so space constraits will defo be present lor,btohqsg
that one is your taiji lor  its depends on whether you are comfortable enough with your self esteem,btohqsg
personally i feel quite secure w my manhood so this kind of thing no need scared paiseh,btohqsg
I see the swift already pai seh,btohqsg

A bit too early. Until motorsporta embraces EV in the future  making an electric M car feels like a cash grab,btohqsg
I think that Thier dilemma also but your point is very true haha what is ev to do with m,btohqsg
But the m badge also too misuse liao,btohqsg
Now even i140 can have a m badge,btohqsg
It still isn't a full M car,btohqsg
It is along the lines of an m340i  X3 m40i  X6 m50d  etc.,btohqsg
It is a m sport model not a purebred M model,btohqsg
Like the m240i and m2 are different,btohqsg

Just that it allows for more devices to be pinged as it is not apple only,btohqsg

They do have a clutch paddle actually,btohqsg
On the back of the steering wheel,btohqsg
They need to use it at lower speeds only though  higher speeds can do clutchless shifts,btohqsg
I pick the Megane RS too! I indicated my choice in the Telegram post tooüòä-R,btohqsg
too much fun packed in one small hatch,btohqsg
they still require the clutch paddle to pull away,btohqsg
and its actually very hard to module the clutch paddle,btohqsg
sequential gearbox are also much faster shifting  much more efficient and much lighter,btohqsg
It‚Äôs semi auto la. Still auto,btohqsg
auto is the computer change gear for you leh,btohqsg
woah sir i think you got it wrong leh,btohqsg
its not like a auto car with paddle shifter,btohqsg
its a manual car that uses hydraulic to change gear upon input by the driver,btohqsg
Which is still classified as auto,btohqsg
it still require the driver to use the clutch,btohqsg
does your auto car require you to depress the clutch?,btohqsg
okay so motorbikes with autoblipper and quickshifter is auto,btohqsg
All f1 cars r auto. They just have paddles shifters,btohqsg
no bro... Cars do not have sequential gears,btohqsg
sequential gearbox is alm impossible to get leh,btohqsg
okay so are rally cars automatic too?,btohqsg
1st time got ppl tell me f1 car is manual,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ i have no idea which part is auto,btohqsg
F1 driver must move the paddle shift? Right?,btohqsg
auto cars can do it too,btohqsg
but they have completely different style of gearbox,btohqsg
Why are F1 Cars Automatic?The simplest answer as to why F1 cars are automatic is due to efficiency. It is easier to shift gears via the steering wheel only  not having to move your hand off the wheel to grab the shifter or use your foot to operate a clutch pedal.,btohqsg
they have no clutch to shift gears...,btohqsg
If dun use hand  cannot move   must be a manualRight?,btohqsg
"Along with using paddles for gear up and down. They do have to use a clutch paddle as well when moving off. Hence the launch speeds are different. Alongside that  if it was ""conventional auto""  there would be no way to stall it during a race as the computer would take over. Yet  many drivers have stalled their cars during races before  albeit they do have a clever anti stall system built in",btohqsg
then their fingers move for tiktok dance ah,btohqsg
No point explaining sequential and dog boxes to Mr Pete @Jingxunn,btohqsg
Have F1 Cars Always Been Automatic?F1 cars used to employ manual transmissions in their vehicles. However  they have been using automatics since 1989.,btohqsg

"u can try out the ""f1 style gb""",btohqsg

they are set upto explain in a simplistic manner,btohqsg
you can go to their media team and ask them to explain how it works i bet they dont even know,btohqsg
F1 website say already f1 cars r auto u still want to say manual,btohqsg
Speechless but titi gong titi gong,btohqsg
Kp ppl buy manual for what?,btohqsg
I buy semi detached is what?,btohqsg
Y u so happy sia ? U proven wrong,btohqsg
But still didi insist u right,btohqsg
do you know how the sequential gearbox work?,btohqsg
Not happy can sue f1 for lying,btohqsg
its okay  maybe when you decide to grow up then u will understand,btohqsg
Wrong already still insist u right,btohqsg
Lol f1 shd hve typed semi manual,btohqsg
Den it will be a manual,btohqsg
Relax. No point explaining to boomers üòÇ it's like trying to explain to a kid what they were taught was wrong.,btohqsg
Mr pete u watch this vid,btohqsg
U should go back driving sch n learn again,btohqsg
aiyo when so many people correct you still so ignorant,btohqsg
Idt boomers will watch the video.  He will say semi manual is still auto,btohqsg
Auto n manual oso can be confused,btohqsg
u enjoy ur sunday klkking okay,btohqsg
Are F1 cars automatic? Yes  but not fully automatic. Instead they employ semi-automatic transmissions. These transmissions have a total of 8 gears and the driver shifts up and down via paddle shifters- J,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not ok. We must explain fully,btohqsg
Brunch is breakfast or lunch? Debate forever,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. Semi auto is also auto,btohqsg
So based on Pete logic. When I buy my  semi detached my house is considered attached even tho the title is semi detached ?,btohqsg
its synchronus manual that matches the speed of the both gear cogs that are beside the current engaged gear. It doesnt require a clutch cos its alr rev matched. Cluth is still require to move of the line because... IT ISNT AUTOMATIC.,btohqsg
Ya la u ask ur agent la.,btohqsg
I shd tell the boomer in my company. Semi retired is retired,btohqsg
Wah u still insist it‚Äôs manual ah,btohqsg
This logic has taught me well. Love it,btohqsg
Need to do smth of cuz manual la,btohqsg
It isnt automatic because the automatic gearbox cannot handle the power and it is far more ineffecient,btohqsg
It is more terminology then anything,btohqsg
the automotive mechanical name is sequential MANUAL gearbox,btohqsg
We go ask f1 boss la. We bet all our assets. Ok ?,btohqsg
Because f1 car is so fast u need 2 hand to be on the steering wheel as the g force is too big   if youUse 1 hand on the steering wheel   and just to change gear u sure buang the car,btohqsg
I also dare to showhand my ‚Äúassets‚Äù,btohqsg
Pedal shift allow you u change gear when both of your hand are on the steering wheel,btohqsg
U explain he also wont listen,btohqsg
He here to prove his point nia,btohqsg
its okay la mr pete if i say auto u can sleep well tonight anot,btohqsg
my mother tell me dont fight,btohqsg
Auto car has paddle shift Ma,btohqsg
Type r using Manuel is for can enthusiasts,btohqsg
yeah but autocar use clutch to shift  sequential gearbox dont,btohqsg
explain in mechanical terms and show its automatic,btohqsg
How dare u ask him explain,btohqsg
Like I said u can sue every1 in f1 for saying it‚Äôs auto,btohqsg
make alot of money one leh,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt agree with f1 ppl then must sue them to prove u right ma,btohqsg
maybe can buy Aventador w HUD like mr pete,btohqsg
clutch oni used at race start and pit stops,btohqsg
No wonder the chef dun understand me when i keep asking for semi cooked steak and eggs,btohqsg
Must be listened to mr pete too much,btohqsg
they still need the clutch to start the race,btohqsg
Semi cooked is still cooked leh,btohqsg
they use synchromesh to change gear,btohqsg
Sue this website leh. Pete say wrong,btohqsg
F1 car don‚Äôt use sequential manual transmission. Formula One cars use highly automatedsemi-automaticsequentialgearboxeswith paddle-shifters ,btohqsg
It isn't an auto clutch though,btohqsg
they are not just automatics  as the drivers are able to select gears using the paddles mounted on the steering wheel. Plus  there is an internal clutch mechanism  making this technically a sequential automatic transmission  rather than a standard automatic.,btohqsg
F1 say they use sequential auto,btohqsg
sequential auto can use dct and torque converter,btohqsg
sequential manual cannot be used in normal cars,btohqsg
Mr Peter must be a vtec kick in hater,btohqsg
Somewhere in the middle I guess guys. Hahaha why are we having this debate again? - J,btohqsg
F1 cars r auto since 1989,btohqsg
Scroll up arnd 12pm+. Someone buay song why stupid ppl use manual trans üôÉ,btohqsg
i think i wont explain anymore,btohqsg
i hope you dont get embarrassed when you explain to people,btohqsg
F1 history already stated they abandoned manual cars b4 1989 u still want to argue,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admini suggest you watch this video,btohqsg
Which stinger do you prefer? 2.0 or 3.3,btohqsg
2.0 is already enough for singapore roads!,btohqsg
The functions of sequential gearbox in a F1 sequential manual and Road legal sequential auto is analogous. The mechanical method of switching gear between a F1 sequential manual and Road legal sequential auto is not homologous,btohqsg
its 2 completely different method of changing gears,btohqsg
@Jingxunnf1 cars only have 2 pedals n don‚Äôt hv stick shift. So pls don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs manual already,btohqsg
but i rest my case. I do dislike the fact fake news and false information is being spread here. As this can confuse many people.@SGCM_AdminMany personal attacks are being made. There are some intentionally causing disputes between certain users and i hope action will be taken should any of this attacks continue to occur.,btohqsg
Maybe I should get a stinger for my next car ü§î,btohqsg
2 only n no stick shift,btohqsg
Wait just curious is my car dct the same as dsg ?,btohqsg
the clutch is on the steering wheel,btohqsg
I think this debate should end before things gets out of hand,btohqsg
I need to go pull rickshaw,btohqsg
And you need to cook food to buy stinger next,btohqsg
But straits times said it was going to be a rainy week,btohqsg
that was initially what i compromised on. But i do not agree with false information being spread around coupled with people using personal insults to prove their point,btohqsg
I carried 2 big containers to collect rain water,btohqsg
As a wise man said before,btohqsg
It definitely diminishes the reputation and authenticity of the contents in this chat.,btohqsg
Never argue with a *beep*. They will bring down to their level and beat you with experience.,btohqsg
sorry admin as much as i love yall but i gotta say some facts need to checked too haha,btohqsg
Yeah I went to Google it and watch the video that@Jingxunnshared. I declare that I'm thoroughly confused now and shall just take a step back from this debate LOL,btohqsg
It is a whole different gearbox altogether. Technology improves and we have more efficient substitutes of using the clutch,btohqsg
i have raced in sequential gearbox karts and single seater cars i hope i know what im talking about,btohqsg
Yes. Although I like iOS and all the way iOS phones Apple Maps is terrible. Took me to wrong places many many times,btohqsg
What I learned from this group is that if you wanna debate with mr pete  you can‚Äôt let emotions get the best of you,btohqsg
I learn better things leh. Half is full. V positive mindset,btohqsg

Chill Mr Volvo! I guess we can all agree to disagree on this matter  so that this debate can end.I know you are the bigger man  so please don‚Äôt be offended by the blunt comments of a certain member. Hope all is well eh?ü§ôüèª-R,btohqsg

Oh he only knows ‚Äúnew‚Äùcars is better than old cars tall. Nothing more,btohqsg

i use apple maps cos it has the same risk of me not getting to my destination as my car,btohqsg
i think i got unreliable fetish,btohqsg
I meaaan  in a certain pov  newer carsarebetter than older cars,btohqsg
Are you unreliable as well Mr Shane?,btohqsg
LOL me too. When I first started using GPS  I was using Apple maps and it sucks so badly. Those newly constructed routes/routes that are removed in SG won‚Äôt be reflected in Apple Maps.-R,btohqsg
It depends on how you look at it,btohqsg
wait but apple maps now really not bad hahaha,btohqsg
But one should be open minded,btohqsg
This is rubbish if you know what he is talking about,btohqsg
How much did apple paid you to say this,btohqsg
Does anyone really know what is he talking about anyways?,btohqsg
He doesn‚Äôt care to offer rebuttal. He only cares to say new is better than old. Even for the same model same generation.,btohqsg
Waze is the best because you can customise yourself,btohqsg
iOS uses Tom Tom maps. Sucks,btohqsg
nice to come back to 300+ messages,btohqsg
So what‚Äôs going on! Who‚Äôs arguing with Pete and what,btohqsg
reminds me of our old friend mr nissan,btohqsg
why ah i thought you will never win arguments with a block of wood,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a skill right!! Serious should be on wanbao team. Sure sell like hotcakes.,btohqsg
Damn‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always slow too these,btohqsg
