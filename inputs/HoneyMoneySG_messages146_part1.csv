Hi all  for SEP is it better to do VC3A or VCMA for tax relief? Little monies in CPF now so no issues on anything being maxed out ðŸ˜…,btohqsg

Guarantor is tricky haha  750k also bravo. 15k annual income still still subject to bank approval.My dad is 74 have dbs live fresh  that day report loss dbs dont even send replacement card,btohqsg

Any Revolut users here can advise how can I withdraw funds from Revolut? If possible  any fees involved?,btohqsg

Talking about thisâ€¦I was unable to collect my NTB bonus because I never activate my physical card.I link the card to my Apple Pay and just swipe the required amount and keep the card cold storage.In the end  I never get the bonus because the cso tell me I never activate the physical card lol.Please donâ€™t commit the same mistake as me ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
So thatâ€™s why I felt it became more dangerous@MelvynEzi,btohqsg
The problem is there's no OTP on first login. Financial related apps should always have OTP on first login.,btohqsg
Probably they dk how to handle logins that go through a SSO like google,btohqsg
Someone said it prompts for OTP when login on new device but I cannot confirm as I didnâ€™t try.,btohqsg
Go under payments > bank recipientNo fee for me for SGD  own name ac,btohqsg
I suggested 12 hour cool down when change new device to amaze customer support team.,btohqsg
That's unfortunate  additionally you are not NTB anymore also.Usually they got put a clause if need to activate physical card or not. If they didn't can appeal  if they did  then is your fault for not following terms.,btohqsg
Thanks. And first top up using card wonâ€™t incur fees right? Do you know the limit for that top up?,btohqsg
Cannot be just on new device  must be on new install  whether same device or not. And best if double OTP  one from SMS (very insecure) and one from email.If they want to go single OTP  then must force to use TOTP authenticator kind. But Singaporeans being Singaporeans  unlikely to want such change.,btohqsg
"There are some related discussions you can find by searching ""Taiwan card"" here.",btohqsg
Think safer to read thru based on Ur tierhttps://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/standard-fees/Seems like there was a change in July n free transfer are now limited to 5 per mth,btohqsg

I don't think above 65 can apply new credit card. They only can maintain their card. Meaning if they already cancelled their card. They will be no longer able to apply new one.,btohqsg
Yes. 55 still can apply but 65 no longer able to do so even if secured credit card. Previously try to do a secured cc for my parents. But dbs cso stated above,btohqsg
Upper limit of DBS secured credit card is 75  as stipulated on DBS website. So clearly someone gave you wrong info.DBS unsecured credit card with MAS stipulated criteria met is 70.,btohqsg
Because 70 is upper limit for unsecured CC and 75 is upper limit for secured CC. For DBS  others may vary.,btohqsg
