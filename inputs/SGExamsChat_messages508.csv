if cannot then idt can come back poly,btohqsg
exactly i heard after hs in america they get diploma,btohqsg
if they offer like top students to like take additional a level subjects,btohqsg
But aiya I tired of comparison with other countries already,btohqsg
I have just accepted my Singaporean fate,btohqsg
not bad if the students are up for it,btohqsg
But yea I feel that I don't really like poly as much as I think I would have,btohqsg
same i was so excited now i hate poly,btohqsg
I love hate la but I go sch I just don't interact with others as much as possible,btohqsg
i still dont have friends andi still dont know half of the peoples names in my class lol,btohqsg
For me is classmates only  people out of class idm interacting,btohqsg
ehh somedays i rather just put my earpiece on,btohqsg
and be away from other ppl,btohqsg
Yk the watics guy from nyp gc ? He my senior and we getting close in a way,btohqsg
Lol I just say I social batt drained,btohqsg
Idw talk to my classmates üò≠,btohqsg
u got a lot of project work?,btohqsg
tbh in year 1 sem 1,btohqsg
but in rp must talk or else your daily grades get dropped down to shit,btohqsg
Right now only 1 module need,btohqsg
my poly every module have teamwork,btohqsg
thats when ppl where trying different ppl for group orj,btohqsg
sem 2 we all fix group alr,btohqsg
sem 1 sieve out the slackers,btohqsg
there was this one time my math lecturer said my collaborative learning is shit because im not talkingits fucking math module bro im just studying sec sch a math how do I talk in that class,btohqsg
Now that's weird but oh well,btohqsg
Tp 3-4 less modules than what I have rn,btohqsg
my classmates talk so much nonsense because they claim its for teamworkto the point i cant even study and focus in class,btohqsg
and thats the main reason i hate this poly,btohqsg
i have a lot of sec sch classmates who went there,btohqsg
And I'm here suffering with useless modules,btohqsg
and when i complain to my lecturer he doesnt even give a fuck,btohqsg
Lol i feel this might be universal,btohqsg
im learning stupid coding broi hate this course that im taking,btohqsg
and im already failing it because im so horrible at it,btohqsg
I have coding fro html and python,btohqsg
i have no interest in that,btohqsg
I'm p sure u also have,btohqsg
how u end up in there then,btohqsg
Anyone here can help me with computing math pls help,btohqsg
its called financial technologyi assumed there would be economics stuff but there isnt anyi shouldve appealed to business course,btohqsg
and not assumed that it would be a decent course,btohqsg
aiyoh should have check the modules first,btohqsg
the jae book dont even have,btohqsg
Now I sad to has lesser modules,btohqsg
i made that same mistake when i was picking my subject combi in sec 3,btohqsg
What is hexa octa oh my dags,btohqsg
u can check relevant diplomas for uni course also,btohqsg
see where ur diploma brings u,btohqsg
but i dont even like my course i have very different interests from thati was just wondering if i can go to a uni that has a diff course from the one im doing rn,btohqsg
bruh tbh its honestly your fault then if you like chose this course,btohqsg
i like philosophy political science and historyi wanted bio course but i have color deficiency so confirm cannot alr,btohqsg
Ik bro I just started on fri,btohqsg
Oh lol I love journalism on sports and technology,btohqsg
So something journalism related I would like but I'm fine with it related,btohqsg
try to do well in y1 and try get a transfer,btohqsg
my teammates pulling me down bro,btohqsg
they are slackers and even though I carried the whole team i still got a shit grade,btohqsg
did all the powerpoint slides myself,btohqsg
even put disagree for peer evaluation,btohqsg
a fucking C for that module,btohqsg
if i fail my modules its not even because im not studying,btohqsg
I got test 2 weeks later with number systems and err set theory and logic stst,btohqsg
is because of the ite north mentality idiots,btohqsg
my teammates for that module all didnt do anything,btohqsg
despite me messaging them that we should do the slides,btohqsg
so i did every single thing myself,btohqsg
how many of them from ite,btohqsg
def half of my teammates from ite,btohqsg
my y2 classmate recently posted on insta abt his teammates miscommunicating with him,btohqsg
ite north for a reason bro,btohqsg
even in tp one of my team members is a absolute dumbass,btohqsg
Bro I think in my class I will be most likely the closest to a slacker,btohqsg
"so basically the group leader called for a meeting..but when my teamate asked him whether he has to stay back ""Twice""...the team leader said no. Then later that night  the team leader messaged my friend asking him why he never stayed back",btohqsg
Just that they all are yruhsrds,btohqsg
if i fail modules its because of my shit teammates,btohqsg
and told my friend  tmr he stayback so he can run through the project with him..my friend was fed up  especially because this team leader also beforehand struck a nerve with him,btohqsg
That is bad by right peer evaluation should reflect your carrying,btohqsg
i put disagree for all of them bro,btohqsg
rp cannot report slackers other than peer evaluation?,btohqsg
some lecturers dont give a shit about anything,btohqsg
to think one of the lecturers in rp   the daughter was in ite,btohqsg
But maybe jc would have suited you better ? Not sure I think really poly is very discussion based and usually the extroverted people will thrive,btohqsg
and just ask cher if u have doubts,btohqsg
and i cannot focus in polybecause my classmates talk and laugh so loud to the point i cant even study,btohqsg
my extroverted classmates are so noisy,btohqsg
but my shit teammates gonna bring me down again,btohqsg
im also not in a course im interested in,btohqsg
But i really think extroverted people willing to put in the hard hours vs introverts putting in the hard hours will be diff in diff environments,btohqsg
i studied so hard for a modulemy self directed learning was level 4 (highest) yet i still got a C just because my teammates didnt do the slides and all of the slides were done by me and another person,btohqsg
but too bad i just have to suck it up and study,btohqsg
but tbh im like starting to maybe like it,btohqsg
i rmb in my sem2..there was a presentation  4 boys 1 girl,btohqsg
idk if i cos i force myself study or i genuinely like it,btohqsg
"all 4 of the boys including me did up the slides etc...add int he info  then the girl suddenly texted day before presentation asking ""So what do i do""",btohqsg
"i told her  ok you can ""read from the slide"" and just told her to present for the class",btohqsg
at least its just 1 person whos slackingmy one right for critical thinking my 4 teammates didnt do anything,btohqsg
That's what I do also so especially grp projects I go above 100% because I don't want to be reliant on others  my parents taught me to be self reliant since young alr,btohqsg
spoiler alert....She presented 1 slide out of 10,btohqsg
because what happens when you dont partake in creating slides?....you dont know wtf is on the slides,btohqsg
Wiki not even that accurate anymore,btohqsg
too bad u need to breathe the same air as them,btohqsg
It's difficult but can't do much,btohqsg
Lol I give up allot of things in my life already so stuff like putting in more shifts for project idgaf alr,btohqsg
I think it's about being realistic alr lor,btohqsg
A might not be possible but A mark is,btohqsg
i want B but so far the only module ive gotten a B for is a module with heavy memory workand im better at memorizing stuff because thats independent learning,btohqsg
because every other grp didn't give a shiet,btohqsg
hey guys what did i do to my gc,btohqsg
how do i get out of this,btohqsg
yeah i was about to say that,btohqsg
any jc ppl in here can help ty,btohqsg
I‚Äôll shall start the day by posting this,btohqsg
Bio course I know RP allow semi colour deficiency,btohqsg
Why would you want to do bio when you're interested in Philo  PS and History?,btohqsg
but i didnt mention that because ive color deficiency,btohqsg
so confirm cannot do bio course,btohqsg
my one is red green colorblindbut idk sia because honestly right i heard people got rejected just because they have color deficiency,btohqsg
and i failed all of my red green color blindness test so,btohqsg
I have seen some lenses that can correct colour blindness. have u seen those?,btohqsg
Fail means cannot do the course ah,btohqsg
Yes. in the JAE booklet  can see some courses are marked with a number. refer to the back of that poly u looking at and the number will explain what it means. some courses must require full colour senses,btohqsg
my parents told me that theres no cure for colorblindness,btohqsg
got lenses when you wear can reverse it,btohqsg
just like how they say cannot cure myopia but theres lazic (idk how to spell) eye surgery,btohqsg
cos if I'm not wrong  certain colour blindness is when red and green colour sensors in your eyes are merged. imagine a venn diagram of green and red circle merging. and because they merge you cannot tell the difference between red/green,btohqsg
the lenses help separate the sensors again,btohqsg
ok I found it  it's called EnChroma glasses,btohqsg
have to see whether your colour blind condition is suitable. some arent,btohqsg
lol i thought that was clickbait,btohqsg
there are entire compilations of colour blind using enchroma for the first time,btohqsg
sian i need wait 2 yr time then i can laugh,btohqsg
then wait another 10year laugh at those reservist one haha,btohqsg
Wait isit an Instagram ad üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg

A lot happened at Blackpink‚Äôs S‚Äôpore concert on May 13:üñ§ Jennie told the audience to put their phones down & partyüñ§ One guy played Angry Birds instead of watching the showüíñ Some fans had the time of their lives outside the stadium‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3pE1RQEFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
if i was there i wld have gone to the nearest MRT station and vibe to the train sounds,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs some low grade news reporting,btohqsg
reads in a jeremy clarkson accent: Tonight's recap of the concert:-Jennie told the audience to put their phones down-Someone plays angry birds on their phone-Some fans had the time of their lives outside of the stadium,btohqsg
id even bother looking at the substandard reporting,btohqsg
why'd you even sign up to a concert that you dont wanna go to in the first place,btohqsg
yea bro i just find the funny shit to laugh at,btohqsg
ryan's articles are the funniest ngl,btohqsg
that guy's search engine is something else,btohqsg
hear say they filming new special agn,btohqsg
but looking forward to it üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ,btohqsg

oh shit imagine a big fat wave comes,btohqsg
BS. No such thing as fast money in crypto,btohqsg
might be a stupid question ah,btohqsg
but I'm wondering whether poly got internship also or only for certain courses,btohqsg
Both nitec n higher nitec got intern aso,btohqsg
ahh I see. normally starts which year and I'm pretty sure intern pay averages around 1k right? seen some NITEC interns getting 300-500 only and had to work past public transport closing time. Intern pay doesn't even cover transportation which is hella sad,btohqsg
Even poly intern pay isn't 1k unless u go prestigious company,btohqsg
My friend's pay in ite was higher than those in poly,btohqsg
If u wan know abt IT/Engineering/business/healthcare pay I can say,btohqsg
NSF are essentially doing slave labour,btohqsg
have a brother who just enlisted. he thinks $600 a month is alot because he's never had a job before,btohqsg
he went JC so he doesn't know,btohqsg
But even uni intern don't even have 1k,btohqsg
I got liquidated by all the fast ways to earn in crypto. Futures  shitcoins u name it.,btohqsg
I gt heard of law interns in firms not getting paid at all,btohqsg
companies have to acknowledge this. see so many of my intern friends get treated as FT workers.,btohqsg
The thing is intern is no diff from ft job scope.,btohqsg
But they shudnt be treated like one,btohqsg
Here am I askin for experience over money,btohqsg
only safe ways in crypto are long term holding and mining. even then it's not a small investment if you want to see good returns,btohqsg
I don't rly care abt pay,btohqsg
My first intern pay was $500+?,btohqsg
but if they treat u like..,btohqsg
And it is the outside working world,btohqsg
Can I say I intern somewhere prestige and I ask for only cert + testimonials?,btohqsg
did u manage to get it tho?,btohqsg
I wonder what kind of place,btohqsg
just hold btc and eth la.. consider SNP500 as another safe investment but not a good time now as chance of recessiob,btohqsg
uni intern shld be at least 1k,btohqsg
u can consider taking up finance course,btohqsg
uncommon to see sgreans who don't care much about money. especially in a overcompetitive job market,btohqsg
I mean I'm in IT sect,btohqsg
cuz u will learn a lot abt such things,btohqsg
Dun wan random ppl come disturb,btohqsg
sign up for JP Morgan ‚Äòs apprenticeship,btohqsg
may not be my interest sjnce I did these kinds of trading and market analysis to earn cash. I hated the studying required for it back then lol so I dropped most of the shit and went to focus on my other ventures,btohqsg
i put myself as childhood asthma,btohqsg
to be honest I don't really know myself. perhaps EVs,btohqsg
ah i see. tbh the topics r q dry. so not for everyone,btohqsg
but risky ah. if your performance like shit they can choose not to sign you. then u sign on and full time 10 years already. When 30 years old and have degree  considered as 0 working experience and really have to drop pay alot,btohqsg
yeah I went front and back the JAE booklet and still can't make much of a decision. I know I'll suffer in engineering courses simply because my knowledge in mathematics isn't very deep.,btohqsg
ev is gd but now they are pushing for hydrogen cars since ev have more disadv than adv,btohqsg
yea makes sense. join smth u love/have Interest one,btohqsg
if have a degree in business management  considered 0 working experience. depends on your vocation also if you are an engineer/maintenance officer.when I'm talking about working experience  im referring to in the relevant specialisations of your studies,btohqsg
if only got sleeping courses üôè,btohqsg
Why do y'all ppl all care so much abt pay when experience is clearly btr,btohqsg
she gt influenced by who alr,btohqsg
SG overcompetitive and expensive. can't really deny the fact that we need money to survive. If you say 2-3k/month is okay then good for you la.But if let's say want to buy house  get married and have kids  2-3k is NOT enough to live as a middle income family which most people do not want to acceptIf you are okay with living below 80%  that's good for you.End of the day  everybody is trying to live happy and unfortunately for many of us  money is just such a huge factor to happiness,btohqsg
Jesus was hated because he was telling the truth,btohqsg
not a Christian but using as analogy,btohqsg
for swiss cost of living   nah,btohqsg
I love the swiss cost of living with no standards ü§°,btohqsg
PAP ministers are all elites. they earn so much ofcourse won't empathize with common folks.,btohqsg
then pap increasing gst to 10%,btohqsg
the following yr   shld be 10% alr,btohqsg
fucking crazy lei. 10% to them on groceries and necessity is nothing lei but for us is such a big difference,btohqsg
then cb give back $500 voucher,btohqsg
over my lifetime  gst will eat up tens of thousands. Knn give back $500,btohqsg
take my whole chicken give me back feathers,btohqsg
for imported goods   uk the tax is stacked on top of the overseas sales tax from the respective countries,btohqsg
the thing is there are problems with statistics and the way they are calculated especially with income. the top 1% of sgreans earning 6-7 figures will jack the average up significantly. and I still see many people using average sgrean income to show that living confortably in SG is not that hard,btohqsg
gdp is not an accurate measure of comfortable living,btohqsg
the lky son is useless running a damn circus. only know how to suck money from citizens to fund their 6/7 figure salary.next time they Increase tax  better see them cut their own salary,btohqsg
and stressful. imagine living paycheck to paycheck. if suay suay kena accident 3 months no income I see how they survive,btohqsg
if u see Scandinavian countries  their tax rates 30-60% but they give so much more benefits. They willing to pay those taxes simply because their tax system works.a stark contrast can be seen with US one. Sg not as jialat as that but we shouldn't act like our tax system works damn well,btohqsg
I spend $5 on one meal also heart break,btohqsg
I just comparing US system to Scandinavian systems,btohqsg
both have high tax rates but citizen benefits wise very different,btohqsg
but I also understand la. US need to play power game. their government have to spend on more stuff compared to small powers like SG,btohqsg
always had a love for history,btohqsg
same. it's kinda weird too because we the Ukraine war  we are literally seeing future content in our kids history text books,btohqsg
one of the MP say its possiblr to save 140k in 2 yearsüòÇ,btohqsg
please find this fella name and when he said it,btohqsg
if it's true ah  I have no words alr.,btohqsg
PAP over complacent. citizens need to put them in their place because end of the day  government supposed to work for citizens. Not the other way round,btohqsg
off topic abit ah but if sg goes to war  I can see  many people desert . who would want to sacrifice their lives for our out of touch ministers,btohqsg
oh the one i send haha,btohqsg
115k after few year of working still possible,btohqsg
better give her go jiak sai,btohqsg
ask her to fk off from parliment better hahahaha,btohqsg
2 years go eat lampa sia,btohqsg
i still rmb one ministet say food very affordable...,btohqsg
bro she thinks everyone is doing her job,btohqsg
yes. pay themselve too much everything is affordable to them,btohqsg
$5 for one plate of rice I also heart break. let alone mcd or restaurant kind.,btohqsg
no wonder amos yee also dulan,btohqsg
and mostly is due to rental knn,btohqsg
I feel like Amos isn't really the bad guy. ( Ignoring his paedophilia cases ) what he say about LKY and the SG government actually makes sense. And then persecuting Amos for the things he said really proves his point,btohqsg
not just bro  my downstairs house all 3 kopishop and the local foodfare used to be cheap,btohqsg
yes i think he is able to speak quite well also if cut out his colorful language,btohqsg
affordable if u wanna die of starvation in 6 days or get bankrupt in 2,btohqsg
I patronize the shops my entire life alr. I see the price change over the years is just fked up,btohqsg
nvm la  can always eat grass. grass is free,btohqsg
my hse econ bee hoon nasi lemak increase from 2.10 to 2.60,btohqsg
pap will find a way to make u pay,btohqsg
idk why but r they just purposefully raising prices for rent and food only to give 'subsidies' to SG/local by not raising rent that much for them to give a forced advantage for SG foods,btohqsg
nvm lah just sign up for army  free food free accommodation@Voidchords,btohqsg
I know got one place sell nasi lemak with egg and fish/chicken $3.50 at marsling. In SG considered very cheap liao because the portion size also not bad,btohqsg
brother ah u need to phrase that a little better. I don't want to make wrong conclusion from this,btohqsg
feels like they pushed all the inflation for past few decades to this few years,btohqsg
tbh if i don't get airbus or SIA or ST eng for aerospace eng idm signing on as ME for air force,btohqsg
fk la. I take mrt to and fro will make up the price difference alr,btohqsg
u go matured estate 1.50  my here consider ex le hahaha,btohqsg
You in aerospace engineering or mechanical?,btohqsg
more then that haha. 1 trip alr 1 dollar plus,btohqsg
ever since sec 1 I paying adult fare cos I lost my ezlink and lazy remake,btohqsg
thx for contributing to nation building,btohqsg
ahh no wonder. if you are in mechanical  navy is a good option as well because when deployed at sea got $$$ increase,btohqsg
at the expense of my wallet being burned dry. speaking of which I lost it 5 days ago with 90% of my cash,btohqsg
I only realized just how crazy expensive sg is when I was Sec 3,btohqsg
in sec 3 or 4 i lost my ez link card i immediately paid the $50 fine to make it again in like a week,btohqsg
by then I skipped sch frequently alr and didn't take public transport as much,btohqsg
and the best part is i didn't even use my card during sec sch,btohqsg
I was naive. sec 3 den I wake up because I started earning my own money,btohqsg
oh primary sch I rarely take mrt also,btohqsg
I life next to my primary sch,btohqsg
fked up right. I didn't even know whether to cry or kms,btohqsg
bro pri sch and sec sch both beside my house,btohqsg
only JC then i decided to go ASR which is q far,btohqsg
lucky last time pri sch my father drive me everyday,btohqsg
yk my JC cld have also been near my house also?,btohqsg
then sec sch i everyday walk liao,btohqsg
YCK is quite geographically centered in SG lei,btohqsg
Are u from like jurong or yishun,btohqsg
dei i live in BBT i always have to go north then back south just to go YCK,btohqsg
but idm that travel tho LOL,btohqsg

brother JPJC at Cho Chu kang simi JPJC at batok,btohqsg

i signed up to see how is the response rate,btohqsg

collect from the bank of ur choice if u get it,btohqsg
tbf yes but i can see whoever came up with this idea also had the thought of this being a 'propaganda' coin lol.,btohqsg
I'd rather follow his values that he has imparted in us for life rather than to keep a $10 coin in a showcase and completely forget abt it 2 days later,btohqsg
someone losing steam alr so trying to build up patriotism,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs why the coin is released,btohqsg

govt linked renters have been buying a lot of new vehicles,btohqsg
so u tell me if this is not rigged?,btohqsg
if its extremely costly in the first place  lesser people wld be able to afford let alone think of buying one  so less people buy cars and hence less cars on the road,btohqsg
OMF my eczema coming back holy shit fuck the heat,btohqsg
brother if you do a controlled quota on no. of cars in SG i can tell you they will become worse,btohqsg
no eh the stadium got on abit of aircon,btohqsg
but coe & all the useless taxes doesn't help. still gt jams & all,btohqsg
ya bro felt damn cool inside,btohqsg
controlled quota will just make prices for them to skyrocket  making affordability worse,btohqsg
controlled quota as in penalize those who wna keep cars more than 10 yrs,btohqsg
the price oso not an issue,btohqsg
the cars will be comparatively new,btohqsg
the point of COE is not for Govt to make more money,btohqsg
tbh sg shld rethink the way of doing public transport. make public transport faster than driving,btohqsg
but COE is literaily there to limit the no. of cars so more people take public transport rather than cars,btohqsg
u see how many will drive alr,btohqsg
for TEL they tried to drive the trains at 90km/h  just only 10km/h above the usual maximum trains run at  80km/h ,btohqsg
but just that small increase in speeds caused many people to report extremely loud noise at speed  some reports even going as loud as 100dB,btohqsg
is they are not willing to invest,btohqsg
travelling to and fro work  and you're slowly losing your hearing,btohqsg
eh. oso depend on the kind of train u use,btohqsg
no need to rch that lvl,btohqsg
because of that i think they alr reduced the speed to 80km/h,btohqsg
ah you think SG trains got no timetable ah?,btohqsg
the train they buy oso that kind of quality,btohqsg
u pay what u get ig,btohqsg
u use literaily any other train,btohqsg
is whether you 're willing to invest in it or not,btohqsg
wah u say that to sg train enthus i tell you they gonna laugh right in your face,btohqsg
like that those 130km/h ones will be noisy af,btohqsg
cuz even 90km/h ppl alr complain v noisy?,btohqsg
SG trains actually do have a timetable they follow  like this train service arrive at this station at this time,btohqsg
no offense but sg trains sucks,btohqsg
sg shld look on ways to improve and evolve it,btohqsg
now the standard is like stagnated,btohqsg
I had trainspotted for more than a year and I've seen the exact same train service arrive at the exact same time at that particular station,btohqsg
the timing on the RATIS display where u see all the ads and train timings use the distance of train from station not how long its gonna take  with temporary speed restrictions on the tracks definitely will take v long even tho timing say like 3min only,btohqsg
have u rode on oversea ones? those faster ones have no issues with noise isolation,btohqsg
only sg have so much issues,btohqsg
you say that but in many ways we are literaily world class in terms of rail transport,btohqsg
you go anywhere in SG there is no train that is driver operated,btohqsg
all trains in SG are operated Automatically,btohqsg
how come can't be banned permanently,btohqsg
u wanna know whats the diff?,btohqsg
overseas got plenty of land-can choose the best possible places to build rail,btohqsg
thats why ever since the north south and east west line no other line is over ground,btohqsg
but uk as the system matures   u can definitely built a faster alternative. u will def have the exp to do it,btohqsg
thats how scarce we are with land,btohqsg
is only whether they want or not,btohqsg
yea. they scrapped the cross island express svc,btohqsg
only now we got Cross island line and Jurong regional line that are over ground (which actually compliment the north south and east west line in in some ways),btohqsg
as in whoever is i/c of it,btohqsg
also because we live in such cramped places we have noise barriers almost anywhere which makes train rides louder,btohqsg
tf i don't even remember that even existing,btohqsg
"they say not ""worth"" building extra tracks underground",btohqsg
