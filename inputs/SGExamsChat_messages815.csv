text,group
Eh u v funny hor expose urself,btohqsg
No idea what u talking about,btohqsg
Was just referring to the text in isolation,btohqsg
i can literally see the ladybug,btohqsg
I did not have anything to do with the text. These allegations are false and I will be vindicated,btohqsg
u admitted that it was u right,btohqsg
There is no evidence to support your theories,btohqsg
but by the time i opened,btohqsg
congrats  you officially become a phamtom,btohqsg
hmm  idk leh  but if the person is here then,btohqsg
No the person is not here so against the rules,btohqsg
I am not lying what is with this relentless crusade,btohqsg
Admit what I didn't do shit,btohqsg
This is a erroneous inquisition against a member in good standing,btohqsg
'Member in good standing' my feet,btohqsg
Actually true we all know who 💀💀 but the person is acting blur,btohqsg
Hmmm but the message is in SGE tho🤔,btohqsg
fk  the wifi is so weak that my phone switched back to roaming,btohqsg
Sometimes my phone stuck w the weak wifi and i cant do anything  got fedup and then just turn off wifi,btohqsg
But ik u hv limited roaming,btohqsg
Per day or for the entire week,btohqsg
Shld be fine if u dun watch video etc,btohqsg
If the wifi is a goner,btohqsg
if not i js pay $4 for an additional gb,btohqsg
I dunno who u referring to so it's false that we all know,btohqsg
I dunno can you prove to the level beyond a reasonable doubt?,btohqsg
I can prove it by removing the name censor,btohqsg
Well by doctoring the proof that piece of evidence had broken the chain of custody and I move to have it striken as an inadmissible piece of evidence,btohqsg
Furthermore under Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence  the defense contends that the probative value of the material is heavily outweighed by the potential prejudicial value for the referenced material.,btohqsg
Hmmm ur own rule🤪And also that is exposing urself🤣,btohqsg
Wdf exposing myself I am merely making a defense against my client  a John Doe.,btohqsg
Also it is a legit rule under the Federal Rules of Evidence,btohqsg
Maybe the weather in Singapore   is why you feel chronically sick,btohqsg
Just move somewhere overseas as soon as you can,btohqsg
actually i think so  my headache and weakness magically disappear overseas,btohqsg
then flee back to sg during summer😊,btohqsg
tbh im in between lah  but i also dunno how im gonna survive being chronically not well...,btohqsg
Can also flee to a country in the other hemisphere or move to another town which is perpetually cold/dry lol,btohqsg
go to russia  -25 degrees celcius,btohqsg
Lol even for me now hor,btohqsg
In Japan weather getting warmer and suffering from migraines more,btohqsg
Weather forecast says it’s still mostly 20+ degrees Celsius in Tokyo tho,btohqsg
Most probably you will die to their paper mache cars or drivers hitting you from driving too fast,btohqsg
But what happen is that the temperature suddenly spikes,btohqsg
musician  u went to japan at the wrong time,btohqsg
Its like today's 20 degrees and tomorrow's 30 degrees,btohqsg
u wun face this problem in hokkaido,btohqsg
it apparently seldom rain also (but i kena 2d of rain during my trip),btohqsg
Either way last week its like 30+,btohqsg
during summer do people wear singlet to office,btohqsg
But it is like suddenly increase temperature,btohqsg
yes i also heard they sleep during office hours,btohqsg
Because they want to absorb the sweat,btohqsg
the sch has 4 season uni right? i cant imagine them wearing the blazer during summer,btohqsg
schs in japan has almost identical uniform  but here in sg the schools are forced to hv distinct uniform,btohqsg
and are much nicer than the uniforms here,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the 4 seasons though,btohqsg
But different seasons different uniform yes,btohqsg
i seen someone sleep during a haircut before,btohqsg
and then the barber has to keep pausing coz the guy keep nodding his head,btohqsg

eh girls dunnid cut hair ah,btohqsg
Idk what he is talking about,btohqsg
No but u looking like a snack,btohqsg
Thanks Minh I will do so,btohqsg
Are the migraines caused by the humidity,btohqsg
Weather says humidity would be over 90% for most of today,btohqsg
But the weather does have an effect on the headaches,btohqsg
Heard a ding on my fan and i guess this bug got KO lmaoo,btohqsg
Yes i think more of humidity than the heat,btohqsg
So if u sleep with aircon at 16 will cause migraine?,btohqsg
I saw a dead bee before in my hse  also ko-ed hit the standing fan…luckily didnt see it when it was flying,btohqsg
Heat + humidity is a disaster combi…if it is chilly + humid  sometimes still ok,btohqsg
Well Singapore humidity is above 60% almost all the time,btohqsg
If you move to Japan can just come back to sg during summer I guess if you still want to see your hometown,btohqsg
If not zhao to the other hemisphere,btohqsg
why the fk is sg's humidity 82%?,btohqsg
It is because it is sg,btohqsg
fml i used 61 mb alr,btohqsg
Not really a real plan as of now  but i can only convince my parents w australia,btohqsg
Didn't know THW accepted CDC vouchers,btohqsg
But yea not a real plan as of now  it is just a possible option to avoid being chronically sick,btohqsg
At minimum wage that's a few hours,btohqsg
I only have time to go out during the holidays anyways so my mom wan go out eat lol,btohqsg
Australia is more dry at least  maybe only Sydney area can get more wet during La Niña (geog stuff again lol),btohqsg
If in Australia you feel fine even when it’s hot then it’s probably the humidity here that’s making you feel ill,btohqsg

Instead of wasting time feeling scared  spend the time to prepare well to be immune to the anxiety of job interviews and assessments.,btohqsg
It is a different situation. One is a hard skill and one is a soft skill,btohqsg
No one can prepare 100% for a soft skill assessment,btohqsg
Wdf is even the distinction between a hard and soft skill,btohqsg
I can attest to that fr,btohqsg
i just didn't care about a levels,btohqsg
I wonder if this will be a hot 4D number for this week haha,btohqsg

Explain? In my opinion i feel thats a neutral statement  just a reminder to be familiar with vector formulas  this is totally unrelated to having rights or power? i know this is off topic in this channel  you can dm reply me or in ⁠a-levels-and-ib   i dont see how any loaded language is used? i dont see how any offensive or harmful language is used? i dont see me being very agitated when typing that  and i used “please”  not even a command  which jus shows it is a little nudge  so how does “right” interfere with that statement which i said? did i command him/her? did i force him/her to memorise? did i scream at him/her when i reply (aka using caps)? and i dont see the point in this message too  i dont see what is the argument or point youre trying to drive at? many people in this server also tell me to familiarise myself with vector formulas to use  and i am just merely and simply just doing what i have been constantly reminded of  anyway you are the one taking the exam  if you cant memorise and/or understand vector formulas or you get confuse with it  it isnt the fault of anyone’s in this server cuz we have been simply reminding you things to take note  my reminder is just that extra nudge to be careful and take note. if the message pisses you off  noone forces you to view this message or pop into this channel  and noone forced or coerced you to reply. i dont see why i am controlled of what i can say and what i cannot say even though the material in that message is just a reminder  a nudge  or whatever synonyms of a similar value and tone you wish to replace with. and tbh what is your argument? such vague comments and opinions yet drive negligible value. you can reply me in dms or in a’s. i wish to not flood this channel with anything unrelated or stir anything in this channel or server.,btohqsg

Mindef will send you a letter if deferment is required.Once you do that and successfully granted one  the next time you have to do anything is 2 years later,btohqsg
??? U will hv to defer what since u are gonna spend another yr taking Os.,btohqsg
Does this mean that all poly / MI students will receive deferment letter,btohqsg
Why cant they even make it auto💀💀💀,btohqsg
its not a deferment letter  its a letter to notify you that you have to defe through the portal,btohqsg
Oh but why cant they make it auto deferment💀💀💀,btohqsg
Why cant they make your world tour auto,btohqsg
because before you apply to defer  the govt or ns dont know anything about you except you have reached 16.5 yrs old,btohqsg
What if someone act blur or genuinely forgot to apply for deferment,btohqsg
they will check with moe to see if you are enrolled in any schools or private institutions,btohqsg
Being a man seems like such a headache lol,btohqsg
And that is why guys starting pay is higher than females,btohqsg

So idk what the fuck he's on,btohqsg
But I was so amused by it I'm gonna drag him to the arcade again aft As lol,btohqsg
I RLY WANNA SEE HOW THE FUCK HE PLAY SIA,btohqsg

it was super hot  then it started raining,btohqsg
Gonna have an outing with my chinese class/with cher but rain apparently,btohqsg
Hopefully dont cancel cus i alrdy otw lmaoo,btohqsg
Convectional rain- When the earth’s surface is heated by conduction  moisture-laden vapour rises because heated air always expands and becomes lighter. Air rises in a convection current after a prolonged period of intense heating. In ascending  its water vapour condenses into cumulonimbus clouds with a great vertical extent. This probably reaches its maximum in the afternoon when the convectional system is well developed. Hot  rising air has a great capacity for holding moisture  which is abundant in regions of high relative humidity. As the air rises  it cools and when saturation point is reached  torrential downpours occur  often accompanied by thunder and lightning.,btohqsg
Na just reminded me of my prof who cancelled an outing 1 hour before the scheduled time.. and the outing wasn't even in NTU,btohqsg
She cancelled and was like come to NTU for lessons instead,btohqsg
