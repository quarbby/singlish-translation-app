How do you take them seriously after that,btohqsg
"lol....they very good at ""packaging"" I give them that",btohqsg
Because for Aspen..Good news drop..Bad news drop drop drop~üòÖü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Just cut if the relationship doesn‚Äôt work out to how you imagine it to be.,btohqsg
Monday morning look see look see bah~This counter ah really~Opportunity cost si bei high..ü§¨,btohqsg
shud call them Anyhow Goreng group,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like companies that always publish news for example Biolitic  Allset etcI like company that silently grows only financial reports eventually tell the whole story,btohqsg
The body language and expression tells a lot of story,btohqsg
maybe short more and collect cheap,btohqsg
Just hope don‚Äôt spoil mood for other counters,btohqsg
If it does then mon Sian liao lo,btohqsg
I dun think it affects too much...I look at Bursa  SGX: TG/RS/MT/UG as guidance to overall medical sentiment,btohqsg
Then maybe others gloves counter benefits ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
Bursa glove stock price is currently in the middle between 52w low and 52w high. If the RSS over at Bursa raise white flag  got chance to rally 25% more at current share price (personal opinion  DYODD) RSS= Regulated Short Sell  (Bursa cap at maximum 4%),btohqsg
Why would a counter which didnt even produce a single glove affect other glove counters?,btohqsg
I think is general sentiments ba.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt exactly have to be medical,btohqsg
Got to see how many bought into its glove vision,btohqsg
No la asspain dont have power to spoil sentiment for other medical ppe.. I dont think anyone will take Aspen serious after this,btohqsg
I nv had any problem leh...I think the platform very stable,btohqsg
Wah! Where you dig this screenshot sia!? ü§£,btohqsg
Just that I never had money nor energy in the first place,btohqsg
Sell to below 20  BBs collect enough then have the contact signed,btohqsg
May not  Aspen was range bound ard 22 b4 Honeywell 210 Mill contract announcement. If no such blunder  aspen may have move up together with other medical stocks. The sell down last few days was quite obvious of the doing of those in the know. Same like the price movement up b4 the honeywell contract announcement. This shows the lacking in Aspen way of keeping sensitive information.,btohqsg
Which means BBs of Apsen gets fist hand info leak while all other retail investors kept in the dark?,btohqsg
Yes agree  aspen was already trading around 23 to 25 range before release of Honeywell deal. At least what we know now is that this deal is in the pipeline  just that the agreement has not been officially signed. Rubber gloves are in strong demand worldwide  I'm sure they have no problem getting other buyers for them.,btohqsg
If this is any indication  the price was moving down cos the sellers know the deal was not confirmed. Any confirmation of the deal will propel the price beyond 27.,btohqsg
Maybe no fault of the mgt. I remember aspen halted a day or 2 for the announcement. It cud be the mgt realised the price movement up b4 that n thus halted to wait for honeywell confirmation. But cud not wait longer as halting more than 3 days may result in suspension. Thus made the blunder of announcing on 12 Apr. The price action after lifting of halt was very strange. Especially when all other medical stocks are in play. Think now looking back at the sequence of event it explain the drop last few days. But I'm betting going forward it may shoot up after initial shock this coming week,btohqsg
There is no change to their fundamental and glove production is on schedule. But there will definitely be panic sellers and shortists taking the opportunity tomorrow. Which one are u?,btohqsg
I personally think the mgt took considerable risk to jump into gloves. The risk assessment and due diligence done months ago was convincing enough for me that aspen wants growth and sustainability. I believe CMY will provide the network to the group. I'm more incline to think aspen has potential going forward. I'm holding  and will buy more if drop further. The key thing I'm looking at is the upfront payment by customers  otherwise may add pressure to aspen capex and ops expenses.,btohqsg
I think luckily other medical stocks are in a rally at the moment  and thus shortlists also cautious. Otherwise the short selling will be fierce,btohqsg
There was placement done some months ago at ard 23 cents I think. So I hope the BBs know what they are doing.,btohqsg

Also they suppose to receive 30% down-payment 2 months before shipment.. no news on that.. given they plan first shipment end of May..  means production also delay?,btohqsg

"Tradeview Commentaries - Retail Investors  Please Thread With Caution On Some Glove "" Goreng"" StocksFor retail investors who are looking to invest in glove stocks once again  I have a sincere view to share with all even though I may not be in the position to dish out advice as investments are very personal decisions. One should only invest in glove sector if you believe in the fundamentals. One should not invest in the glove sector just because you think the Covid-19 cases are rising again locally and domestically. Your investment shouldn' t be sentiment driven or short term in horizon. You should invest because you believe in the earnings visibility  yield  strong balance sheet  management and potential of the sector.I noticed past few weeks since the glove stocks rally restarted  there have been many ancillary stocks shooting up (especially goreng stocks) once again following the limelight of the major glove companies. As retail investors  you must protect yourself as no one will protect you. Make wise decision. Do not enter a stock just because you think a thematic rotation into Healthcare stocks are underway. One must separate wheat from chaff. Those so called "" glove related companies"" who failed to deliver earnings and execute MOUs / orders signed should be avoided at all cost. Those companies who suddenly announced in the past 2 weeks in the media that their company secured how many orders at what price and will commence production soon or venturing into glove sector  please ignore these companies. It is completely nonsensical that these companies can do better than the incumbent market leaders.We have very good fundamentally sound glove companies in Malaysia. I have written extensively on this before. But be selective. Please do not get caught up in the hype. If you do like glove stocks  only invest in those which are market leaders and delivering record earnings & yield. These companies will be able to sustain long into the future. Those new entrants and making fresh ventures / MOU / announcements are just lemon stocks being "" operated"" to trap retail investors. Do exercise caution.Source :www.tradeview.my",btohqsg
