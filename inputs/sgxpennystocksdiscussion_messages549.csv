i see increasing vaccination deaths. no doubts can see this way too.we got 2 weeks to confirm,btohqsg
just curious what the response will be when unvac deaths dropvacc deaths and occurence increase furtherwhether they can still open eye wide wide and lie through their teeths to divide the nationfact is that this govt have undemocratically choose to inconvenienced its shitzens which is over and beyond the boundary of human rights.but singapore no rights la.remember it starts from small thingssoon it will develop to dictatorshipwhich is why biden approval is dipping crazily,btohqsg
soonif these work sam may have to pay more taxes,btohqsg
