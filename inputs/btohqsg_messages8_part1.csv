U can just change ur router,btohqsg
Ok. I'm so sorry to hear that.,btohqsg
Try and look at other Telco.,btohqsg
Circles life cheaper for network only bah,btohqsg
See what they offer.So far for me I'm using myrepublic and it's pretty smooth for me so far.,btohqsg
Ya sorry I mean myrepublic üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
How much for monthly u pay?,btohqsg
49.90My mesh I bought separately.So the price don't include mesh.,btohqsg
Singtel put mesh $10/month1gbps $39.90/monthAlso $49.90,btohqsg
Maybe I try ask them can $39.90 only without mesh üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
What i would suggest is ..Since u dont need the mesh  look at plans w/o mesh.,btohqsg
I just did a simple search  MyRepublic have 41.99/mth with a TP Link router (Maybe u need).,btohqsg
Or if u feel confident with ur router  MR got 38.99 without any router.Or even better  some people rarely use the connection  u can consider 200mbps @ 27.99/mth,btohqsg
Which saves u a lot of money,btohqsg
Same I havent got sms or email too.,btohqsg
I think u select the wrong package with bundle.,btohqsg
Dun dare to try. Coz work from home lols,btohqsg
I choose the one without bundle  it's still put $49.90 . Feel cheated,btohqsg
@SebasSebSebasSebthanks for the help. If not I tot every household must have the mesh ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ,btohqsg
Should be able to skip bah.,btohqsg
Skip lo.. payment cart there shows $49.90 not $39.90 .,btohqsg
Haiyaaaa if hdb email say exceeded the flat supply and not successful means no chance already right?,btohqsg
Normally Within few days. All depends on slot availability for Terminal point installation and ONT installation...,btohqsg
If u got chance... They will indicate so,btohqsg
I applied for sengkang 4 room sbf,btohqsg
On to the next round I guess,btohqsg
Not a good news on my birthday üò≠üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya now waiting for august zzzzzz donate $20 already,btohqsg
Not successful. Waiting for NOV sbf liao,btohqsg
Anybody got queue number but exceeded?,btohqsg
got 108 out of 38. now hoping they wont call us down to pick :( Confirm leftovers rabak one hahah if not the one chance forfeited...,btohqsg
Haahha better not call us down,btohqsg
leftovers sure not nice one haha,btohqsg
Hot areas will be snapped up regardless of level of facing,btohqsg
Tengah is like punggol  but slightly better,btohqsg
Due to location  I think hard to convince people to take up lower floors and bad facing,btohqsg
How to see the queue number? üò¨,btohqsg
That time we can agar agar based on which unit was still available,btohqsg
But I heard that is no longer an available information.,btohqsg
Also  it doesnt forfeit my chance for first timer right?,btohqsg
When no more units left  they will inform you by email,btohqsg
You didn't have a chance to select,btohqsg
38? 4 room or 5 room?,btohqsg
4room. 38 is the units available,btohqsg
Never receive any sms or email for the results,btohqsg
U mean current number? If you alr have appointment date  you'll be able to see the last queue number of the day by logging in to the hdb site,btohqsg
Right..need to wait my mum back. I applied for her.,btohqsg
Ohh so like ppl who exceeded the queue  cannot see what‚Äôs left to gauge our possibilities ah?,btohqsg
You mean see which units have not been selected?,btohqsg
I think once selections starts can see,btohqsg
