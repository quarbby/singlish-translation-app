is like how we feel about pw and our h1 content lor\,btohqsg
I always thought standard English is always spoken in local Universities?,btohqsg
back in the days where i had to do pw and h1 math,btohqsg
U have to get the ability to code switch,btohqsg
even mi can have like 30% 70rp,btohqsg
cant use words like “this one” in your report,btohqsg
Angmoh no go uni also can make a living,btohqsg
We no go uni auto sign on,btohqsg
Eh but now fr u sign on also see cert one,btohqsg
U uni but no high gpa go in become farmer only,btohqsg
Because on top alot yes man,btohqsg
Easy to say coz they are not the ones executing,btohqsg
They dont see how things work on the ground,btohqsg
Sorry but now the band is like what ah,btohqsg
I know now dont have a1 a2 grade,btohqsg
wah and they removed the 4th subject,btohqsg
meaning dunnid study for econs anymore,btohqsg
“4th subject is no longer important”,btohqsg
do yall think uni admissions will get even tougher,btohqsg
Cause a lot of competitions from many schools,btohqsg
more ppl gonna fight for a place in uni,btohqsg
Could you explain what's liquidifed haha thx,btohqsg
next thing yk ur children go to sec sch sit next to a minah and a#mavistuitionkid,btohqsg
half the team gon go “do for what pass can liao”,btohqsg
the other half gonna stress out,btohqsg
suddenly its hard to pass and easy to fail pw,btohqsg
thats what my schmates did when gp wasnt a promotional subject,btohqsg
the question is.... does even passing PW matter? if say you get AAA,btohqsg
i mean new system of course,btohqsg
and now they’re gonna make them not care abt h1s,btohqsg
u do well enough for ur h2s mean math cbb lor,btohqsg
ki is gonna be a cntrasiting,btohqsg
Guys is it me or is mt getting tougher in schools,btohqsg
What did you get for MT?,btohqsg
O levels prelims f9  o levels C5,btohqsg
But when it comes to o levels,btohqsg
"actually no... old (older?) a level don't even need to bother about PW and H1 (because there is no such thing)... just 3 or 4 A level subjects and GP... (and MT for ""fun"")",btohqsg
Somehow we get a decent score,btohqsg
Owh  I got A for N level,btohqsg
The qns they are testing are getting more further and further away from the normal vocab you see in the text book,btohqsg
Btw I rmb my o levels was a story about dolphin love,btohqsg
but the older system is better... can really do 4 A's or (4 H2 in current context) without much trouble,btohqsg
Like a fishermen fell in Love with a dolphin,btohqsg
"since they are ""killing off"" h1  might as well revert back to old system",btohqsg
What do you guys think of the new Singapore-Cambridge Exam?,btohqsg
Y’all should see the new class branding system,btohqsg
Everybody mandatory 4 yrs in sec school  sec 5 is gone,btohqsg
it was already announced like 4 years ago..  just formally made it again,btohqsg
This can only mean  there will be a lot of students that barely makes it to jc but decide to choose that route then die during y1,btohqsg
Dw I know  but what about retaining? They never said anything about it,btohqsg
"moe need to ""study"" and tweat... have 3-4 years for them",btohqsg
I feel like this arrangement will just further increase competition honestly,btohqsg
Shut up I’m the last batch in my school to do PW SERIOUSLY,btohqsg
oh shit why’s there a peach,btohqsg
The people going up to sec 5 is higher for the last batch,btohqsg
Intake of sec 5 higher means more competition for those in poly and jc,btohqsg
yes... the new system is just the old a level lite,btohqsg
Bruh literally half my sec 5 clsss went into nursing,btohqsg
They probably js want to see more perfect scorers,btohqsg
But we are short on this industry so they accept literally anyone,btohqsg
I think acceptance is 400 ppl per poly,btohqsg
No drop out retake a lvl Jae to school that offers,btohqsg
they probably still retain h1 (constrating?) for the idealistic goal of widening knowledge (but like people still care)PW for people to learn how to work (leech) together... social-emotional competencies...,btohqsg
But then the career prospect of this course is less than ideal tbh,btohqsg
If I know I can do well in arts,btohqsg
You basically sealed your career to the hospital,btohqsg
Is just if I retain one year in MU,btohqsg
Best is go for those courses like mechanical eng,btohqsg
Does not take a Einstein to know why,btohqsg
My cai png store sells shredded carrots,btohqsg
But your potential time you have to climb is subdued cause You still are a nurse,btohqsg
But then again u dont need a computing degree to work in google,btohqsg
Mine sell whole eggs  they crack in front of your eyes for you,btohqsg
Some jobs don’t even have interviews,btohqsg
Easy if ur papa is ceo,btohqsg
Some more they cutting manpower alr,btohqsg
I think the best thing a singaporean can do right now  is try to apply for a good job in Africa or a country that have very little educated,btohqsg
Actually I see a very intresting loophole,btohqsg
As a student   go and apply those shitty course in uni,btohqsg
What happens if you migrate to a less wealthier country  but get a job that post you overseas,btohqsg
My poly lecturer teach me one,btohqsg
Provided you can get into Uni,btohqsg
Actually u start doing it since sec sch hor,btohqsg

legends can be good can be bad,btohqsg
I'm taking a lot of Ls,btohqsg
In poly your lecturers don't care if you go lectures or hand in assignments or score badly in tests. Stay disciplined. You will be treated like a young adult who can take charge of their own learning and decision-making.,btohqsg
My poly lecturer don’t even do Google meets,btohqsg
He just takes it they everybody attends class nd marks everybody as present,btohqsg
Based on your personal experience  how did your poly lecturer treated you?,btohqsg
Follow the ghost  they know da war,btohqsg
Got a lot of lecturers leh  overall they are ok as long as you do your due dilligence like trying out to answer stuff  then when hit a wall  consult them. I know some lecturers ghost emails which is honestly fked up  be ready to find them f2f lol,btohqsg
Actually every year the place got some stupid new construction so it's easy to get lost,btohqsg
Workshop/maritime area used to be almost entirely barricaded for me coz construction,btohqsg
Then suddenly once its done it's a hugeass empty walking path with garden,btohqsg
As mentioned  as long as you do your due dilligence  things should be ok. Mostly if you do wrong it's due to inexperience and that's ok.,btohqsg
Were there any messed up experiences with your lecturers?,btohqsg
Not really  mostly it's students that's the drama one,btohqsg
not really  mostly its just ego boosting on both sides,btohqsg
either the students are super high to the point they know everything...or lecturers who think they are high to the point...they are like a dictator,btohqsg
other than not  mostly normal people,btohqsg
sec school teachers are def worse,btohqsg
i feel A lvl shldnt be easier,btohqsg
The contrasting pass fail one is strange hahahaha,btohqsg
Ig whole point is that it doesn't affect your score lor,btohqsg
But ig yea if the bar for passing is so low,btohqsg
It's a guaranteed pass even if you don't do shit,btohqsg
Does that mean that everyone gets an A,btohqsg
So does that mean if the whole sch come tgt and don't do,btohqsg

“Parents and educators may be concerned that our pre-tertiary students will no longer take their fourth content-based subject or PW work seriously ” said Mr Chan.“We believe that our students will still apply themselves.”,btohqsg

they literally do a story on everything lmao,btohqsg
the first time i used this,btohqsg
i dont even know how mothership gets their funding,btohqsg
Cuz I js saw the post of a lecturer in gorilla costume,btohqsg
oh...once in a while  students will be asked to dressup for some coedy skit,btohqsg
Its more of a lifestyle news page than a conventional business and serious paper,btohqsg
either that if not its events,btohqsg
More like the typical Kaypo auntie/uncle news,btohqsg
you will ocassionally see cosplayers dress up for a regular rp day tho,btohqsg
We can agree to disagree hahaha,btohqsg
there is a reason  because mothership was never suppose to be a actual news site,btohqsg
Lien We King is a Co-founder for Mothership,btohqsg
What do you guys think of SGAG?,btohqsg
Satire site for both sg and malaysia,btohqsg
mothership was never meant to replace straits times or todayonline,btohqsg
Most of their articules are favoured towards the younger generation..,btohqsg
ngl ill be having nightmares by the time I get home,btohqsg
Sometimes I don't get why they posted memes,btohqsg
