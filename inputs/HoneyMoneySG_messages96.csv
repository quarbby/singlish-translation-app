But like what Mt said  you're still paying for interest on the $100k instead of how much you actual owe at any point of given time.,btohqsg
Hi all  i participated in the christmas promo for UOB ONE account. The opening of my account got approved on 1 Dec 2023 but i didnt have 100k for the first few days. Only made it to 100k in around the mid of Dec. So how does the earmark thing apply in my scenario? Do i still need to zero out my account near the end of this month? Please advise,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/153123If your earmark still hadn’t happened u didn’t make it for Christmas promo. .,btohqsg
So is it correct if i zero out my account on the 29 of this month. Then i participate in their new promo and put 100k back?,btohqsg
Have your $100k earmarked in Jan? Do you still see the $100k in your account today?,btohqsg
I have the full 100k from jan till today. But i didnt participate in the Rising Dragon promo,btohqsg
If u are not in any promo. Why not take part in rising dragon?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Because your 31 Dec balance is $100k,btohqsg
I’ll choose 28th March to zero.And wait for the details for April promo  if any  to be released.,btohqsg
So i no need to participate in rising dragon right?,btohqsg
U cannot. If you had $100k on 31 Dec.,btohqsg
Empty it either on 28 or 30 Marbefore 6pm  then credit it back on 01 April. Then pray there is a uob promo in 2nd quarter.,btohqsg
Hi I’m applying for my first credit card and I’m wondering what CC should I get if you guys can advise! I’m contemplating between SC Smart credit card / UOB Evol card / Citi rewards card / HSBC revol card. Is there a card you would recommend?I’m not a huge spender and don’t do much online shopping,btohqsg
Remember ALWAYS pay the credit card bill in full every month! Don't pay min and roll over!,btohqsg
May I check empty it to $0 or still need to maintain $1k minimum amount to avoid paying the fall below fee?  Thks,btohqsg
If you already have fund and then make it empty then this already considered daily average minimum balance so not necessary to keep $1000,btohqsg
You need to calculate your MAB from 01-27 Mar/01-29 Mar is above $1k. If you have put $100k inany 1 dayin account  your MAB is already either $100k/27 days = $3.7k or $100k/29 = $3.4kBoth are above minimum balance.,btohqsg
That’s correct  but the fee is higher than moomoo or tiger.And the user interface is confusing,btohqsg
Hi guys do you think Saxo is a safe platform to invest?,btohqsg
Saxo has been in market for very long time,btohqsg
Is there a need to wait n enter promo to participate the event first before putting back the funds on 1st April?,btohqsg
Thanks.  Which means if there is no upcoming promotion  need to remember to top up $1K if already emptied.  Hopefully have.  🤞,btohqsg
Wait for new TnC from bank. Nobody know is there new promo or any change in TnC. Once it is announced  read the TnC.,btohqsg

Is there an app that helps to keep track average daily balance?,btohqsg
Orh Icic. Do you track it on a daily basis?,btohqsg
No because I don't have a need to do it. But there are others who do.,btohqsg
No. Because we try not to have unnecessary transactions on the account. The daily average balance remain constant throughout the month. No need to track. Any amount credited in will be transferred out by 6pm on the same day.,btohqsg
don't confuse solvency with profitability. ie possibility that these companies will survive doesn't mean profitability will maintain (or increase) and you won't survive dividend disruptions or capital losses.Singtel  SPH  Singpost survived  but not sure we can say the same about stock total shareholder return. SPH is still around  but in another form and what was the delisted price.....?Also  airline industry is infamously high capital intensive and cut throat in margins....,btohqsg
so you mean that you check your bank account everyday?,btohqsg
If nothing in and out then no need to check what.. only the 1 2 days like interest crediting,btohqsg
but you may forget/dont know if someone transfer to you,btohqsg
Set calendar alerts? Why would anyone transfer to these accounts that should be untouched?,btohqsg
Means that will need to change the usage of the account. Btw  I am referring to OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
Your friends are so good to transfer money to you with no purpose? Shall inform them to transfer to other account  eg. Posb saving account.,btohqsg
Any account that you need to track the MAB shall have as less transactions as possible.,btohqsg
U can set paynow nric n tel different bank. most people paynow via phone no.,btohqsg
For UOB One  Stash & OCBC 360 similar accounts  we should use them for the purpose of earning the high interest only so as not to disturb the MAB. If we need an account for performing daily transactions and still earn reasonable interest  I suggest using Trust account.  If you are NTUC member  you are getting 3% regardless and have a high cap limit of 500k  I will use that account to transfer in/out to other accounts to take advantage of promotions.,btohqsg
My funds have been deposited successfully in my long bridge security account.,btohqsg

In UOB stash Account  first 15 days have 50k and then next 15days have 150k  still is this consider MAB is 100k and full interest credited?,btohqsg
Provided that month has only 30 days and first day of the month you credited your $50k is not Sunday or public holiday. Also your current month MAB must equal or higher than previous month MAB.If your previous month MAB is $100 000.01  you won’t get your interest this month.,btohqsg

Oh I deposit on 5th Mar  probably have to wait till 5th April?,btohqsg
I’d say yes  because no cap and 3mpd. Pretty much all higher mpd card have a 1k-2k$ cap  and 0.4mpd beyond cap. Need to do the math to be 100% sure  but i’m pretty convinced that Krisflyer UOB will give you the most miles due to no cap and 3mpd,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer have capped tho based on your 5% MAB,btohqsg
If you are aiming for 3mpd  no cap.If you are aiming 5-6 mpd  there is cap.,btohqsg
I think that's for UOB Krisflyer *account*,btohqsg
KF debit card has cap cc no cap,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice guys  appreciate it! 🙏,btohqsg
hi i’m confused - is citibank cashback or rewards better for food delivery like foodpanda?,btohqsg
Anyone on OCBC’s BCIP? I assume it’s a monthly recurring right? I noted funds usually debited from account on 17th of every month  but if 17th is NBD  then will deduct on the preceding business day. So far this month haven’t deducted yet (should be 15 March)? Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
Oh soo only payment made either on1) SIA related purchases2) Kris+ app transactionhave uncapped 3mpd?,btohqsg
Category 2 is also uncap 3mpd.,btohqsg
Most 4mpd card are capped at $1k tho.. so that makes uob kris cc with kris+ app the best way of obtaining miles?,btohqsg
Yeapp. But card like HSBC revolution earn 4mpd only any online and contactless paymentCapped only at 1kIf uob kris cc can earn uncapped 3mpd on any transaction made via the kris+ app  that would be good for really big purchases tho,btohqsg

But after 1k on local healthcare will still incur charge,btohqsg

im wondering if they also removing charges for 5999? email is not being specific,btohqsg

Gold prices retreat from historical highs  but analysts remain bullish on near-term outlookThe pullback came as investors braced themselves for a slew of policy decisions from major global central banks including the US Federal Reserve this week.But  on a year-on-year basis  gold spot and futures prices are up 8.4% and 4.2%  respectively.https://bt.sg/SGAN,btohqsg
So does this means amaze with uob rewards get affected with the 1% charges?,btohqsg
[BREAKING] From 1 Apr 2024  Instarem amaze will implement changes in 1% fees charged additionally for certain transactions💴 Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze1. Removal of 1% MCC Fee on Specific Domestic Payments:- Amaze is eliminating the 1% MCC fee on domestic payments for services such as security brokers  insurance  healthcare  education  car dealers  government  and business services.- However  note that certain payments like E-wallet top-ups and EZ-Link wallet top-ups will continue to incur a 1% MCC fee.- Users can check the Merchant Category Code (MCC) of their transactions on the app.2. Introduction of New 1% Domestic Fee on SGD Transactions:- Amaze will apply a 1% fee (minimum 0.50 SGD) on monthly domestic spending exceeding 1 000 SGD when linked to a card.- Alerts will be sent via email and push notifications as users approach the fee-free cap of 1 000 SGD for domestic spending.- The fee applies to all monthly domestic spending  including refunded amounts and temporary holds by merchants.- Domestic spending below 1 000 SGD and spending when linked to a wallet will remain fee-free.3. No Changes to International Spending:- International spending in foreign currencies remains unaffected by these changes and will not count towards the 1 000 SGD fee-free cap.Follow the story in the Telegram group👉 Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysg🗣️👉 More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode📢,btohqsg
So if spending in Malaysia over 1000sgd  no 1% additional charge   right,btohqsg
So how is about if I book hotel/airbnb at oversea ? Should I change sgd to oversea currency during booking?,btohqsg
Only natural  there has to be some profit-taking after 9 straight days of gains too,btohqsg
seems like not good to spend more than 1k domestically alr 🥲,btohqsg
Those using citi rewards+amaze for mobile wallet payments like xnap and Kris+ also affected if (above $1000),btohqsg
The 1000SGD fee-free cap is applied per Amaze card right?Example:Amaze card 1 is linked to credit card 1Amaze card 2 is also linked to credit card 1Domestic spending for Amaze card 1 = $1000Domestic spending for Amaze card 2 = $200Question: will I be charged $2 (1% of $200) or I won't be charged anything?,btohqsg
I would think it is by per amaze acct,btohqsg
Jus a thought.... their monthly spending is based on calendar mth right?,btohqsg
"seems to be the case for now... though i wonder how will they ""bill the charge""",btohqsg
yes... so it is anticipated if your CRMC cycle is different.. might kenna,btohqsg
Should be since it start 1 apr then the 1k should restart 1 may,btohqsg
just like the 1% currently... the moment u spend.. you see one more line.. FEE,btohqsg
cannot be la... then every txn one charge above if accumulated over 1k meh  dam pain wor,btohqsg

Hi bosses. I topped up VCMA $8k  reflected in filing  but income tax NOA doesnt include it.Called IRAS hotline  they say VCMA tax relief only applicable to self-employed individuals.Can anyone confirm..?,btohqsg
When did you top-up? Did you top-up before 31 Dec?,btohqsg
for tax relief on personal  should be under RSTU to SA provided u have not yet reached prevailing FRS,btohqsg
It should reflect under Total CPF Cash Top-up  CPF Cash Top-up for Self and/or by Employer,btohqsg
VCMA also qualifies for tax relief.,btohqsg
i think you should censor off your NRIC,btohqsg
Lesson learnt.. next time top-up correctly..,btohqsg
It should be eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
"It is. Just that I didnt' select the ""Member"" option when topping up. It was the pre-selected ""Self-employed"" option instead.",btohqsg
Ah. Ouch. Well on the bright side u will reach BHS earlier to supercharged your SA,btohqsg
Anyone know if HSBC Revo on kris+ tour agency provides us with 4mpd?,btohqsg
No. HSBC revo excludes hotel and travel agency,btohqsg
So if paying for meals with Kris+ and UOB KF    is it 3mpd on Kris+ and 3mpd on Krisflyer?I have lady’s card on dining as well,btohqsg
I don’t see it In the exclusion tho,btohqsg
But then revo says 4mpd on all online purchases… doesn’t that include kris+ (any shop),btohqsg
Since when they give 4mpd for all online purchases? There’s a whitelist and your transaction MCC must fall within that whitelist.,btohqsg
Do you happen to know the mcc for tour agency on kris+?,btohqsg
Very dangerous. I think almost all the tour agencies using kris+ are not Uob lady travel Mcc.They are tour attraction Mcc,btohqsg
Mcc for tour agencies shd be under 4722 which was taken out from hsbc revo whitelist wef 1 jan.. to be safe  use another card instead to get bonus rewards bcos its likely that hsbc is just going to award only 1x pt (0.4 mpd) instead of 10x pt (4 mpd) if the tour agencies fall under 4722,btohqsg
So best is UOB Krisflyer as mention by someone above.? Cause all kris+ payment awards 3mpd uncappedAmirite?,btohqsg
Question on this webull referral reward… for the first friend  if they subscribe to 100k usd moneybull and fulfill all the holding requirements… does that mean first friend referral reward is 800usd nvda?,btohqsg
Hmm might be.. i think it feels safer to use uob krisflyer bcos you know you'll get 3mpd uncapped which will make a huge difference in the rewards earned,btohqsg
I thought UOB lady travel mcc is for non kris+ transaction tho,btohqsg
Can u rephrase. Don’t get u.If the merchant under Kris+ has Uob lady travel accepted Mcc it will get 6mpd.But so far most reports from people using Kris+ to pay travel agent don’t seem to get 6mpd unless they appeal,btohqsg
From my understanding  UOB lady card is one of the card which allow travel agency to award 6mpd assuming we don’t pay via kris +But it’s a different story if paying via kris +,btohqsg
Without Kris+  MCC is most likely 4722. With Kris+  MCC most likely changed to 7991. Both MCCs will not get 4mpd with HSBC Revo. To make your life easier  just use UOB KF with Kris+.,btohqsg
I think big travel agencies will all be 4722 if without Kris+But the smaller ones at China town. Not too sure… haha,btohqsg
That’s sounds like an easy uncapped 4(3+1) mpd,btohqsg
Yeah after 1st April. Uob lady can move aside for Kris+ plus Uob kf for travel agencies.,btohqsg

Opss... Then have to find alternative. Thanks.,btohqsg
This OCBC360 guide is so golden. Really grateful for your gracious share.👍Can we discuss the strategy more?I understand that we shd clear out salary bank in asap so we wont unecesarrily blow up the ADB for the month (anything above 100k is not profitable). But how do we account for the bonus bank in from ocbc every month? It easily adds up to $300+  shdnt we clear it as well as soon as its in.. again  this means there will be more and more observation/intervention days to keep track of..Any one have a effective one off single day action to set the ADB accurately to be slightly >$500 at month end?,btohqsg
No  it is AMEX True Cashback Card,btohqsg
You will get their cashback on the statement,btohqsg
U mean utilities payment is qualified for the cashback?,btohqsg
1). Point 2. Transfer out the bonus(monthly interest) on the same day. Preferably before 6pm or 9pm.2). You need to understand how MAB works n how soon it reflected on the web portal. Once you master this skill  you will be able to do incremental $500 at month end using one big lump sum.The simple guide is for newbie. Once you are master on this  you can use whatever strategy that benefits you.,btohqsg
Yes  for amex... only government services are not qualified i think.,btohqsg
Wow  that's good. Thanks for pointing out. Someone just replied said it's not qualified just now. Lol.,btohqsg
Hmm i just thought it through also.. a single large incremental at last day of month also meant at start of next month need to withdraw that.. 😵‍💫I am still trying to think through the strategy.. hope i can solve this math problem,btohqsg

Recently been a bit choppy but my friend who uses Gomo also said the same so I suspect is SingTel problem rather than zym,btohqsg
No lte is fine ig just wonder what provider has great speeds,btohqsg
Volte.. not lte. Speed also depends on coverage and congestion. If you're in a place very packed with people on the same MNO  then you'll be impacted.But also depends on the MNO's equipment... If it's cui like S....A then even if you're the only one there with the best coverage  you may still end up with a horrible experience.,btohqsg

Hi  for the EGA 1% cashback on giro  the capped of $300 is it counted by the cashback credited within a calendar month or the giro debited in a calendar month?,btohqsg
cashback. so basically capped at 30k of spend spread across GIRO and HSBC credit cards,btohqsg
problem is we won't know when they will actually credit the cb back to us. TnC says within 14 days which is kinda big window period. Say i have a 50k bill to earn 1%  split across 2 weeks which is last week of this mth and 1st week of next mth  if cb for the first split got delayed to next month  then $200 worth of cb will be gone.,btohqsg
The cashback usually credit within the next week or next few day. Only 1 delay encounter to be a week plus,btohqsg
It’s based on transaction date. I happen to transact at the end of the month and cashback was credited in the beginning of the next month. So I got cashback partially only. I added all cashbacks received in transaction month and found out that hit the limit already (transaction month cashbacks + partially received in the next month = $300),btohqsg
from JB? do the specs company provide it if we pay a sum -- why so its cause of progressive lens need takes weeks,btohqsg
your transaction date means is the GIRO deduction/debited date?,btohqsg

Hi would like to seek opinions.I have a ILP which is not doing great  but will incur surrender penalty if I terminate it <10 years  I still have 2.5 years to go. I am placing $200per mth and have invested $18k to date. Surrender value is $14k.My previous FA had recommended me to “cut my losses” and reinvest it to a new product   but I was less savvy back then + cannot afford the $600pm for the product she was recommending.Still not great now - but I am working on building my 100K for Uob one   and going to start to look at other areas such as ETFsTIA,btohqsg
You're working towards 100k the 18k to date is to reach what terminal value? Seem like a small savings ac of 200pm. Recommend don't dump it,btohqsg
Thank you for the sharing of resetting. May i know how often shd we do the reset and the rationale?,btohqsg
My thought is no matter what  interest earned from ILP is still typically better than what you earned from a bank account.   Considering you have only 2.5yrs left  that is not very far off. I surprised your previous FA will recommend something that is not sustainable for you. That is not in the best interest for you from my viewpoint.,btohqsg
Why need to pump more money? Can always just switch fund and status quo on premium.,btohqsg
I’ve similar ILP condition. But I believe it is the insurance cost that ate up. Maybe just leave it (for protection purpose only) iso switching,btohqsg
Once you have your 100k in UOB one account  suggest not to touch that account at all. Leave the money there to earn the 5% annually. Have another account that you can use to deposit and deploy your money easily. There are such accounts that allow that and you can still earn reasonable interest. Ex: 3%,btohqsg
what is the surrender penalty ?,btohqsg
Typically ILPs have large fees that will eat into your premiums+gains  to the point where it’ll take years for the investment gains to offset the fees and you get to a breakeven point.But some details required to be able to make a better informed decision are:1. How much is the surrender penalty?2. What has been the historical performance of the invested fund?3. What fund types are available to invest?,btohqsg
The 100k uob one account only exists while the fed rate remain High. Given possible rate cuts and sora to follow its good to look into other investments and do take note of duration risk! If you're not buying any big ticket items like renovation or car or house  it's perfectly fine to park them in a non bank account/ fixed deposits for a longer term,btohqsg
Current accounts or savings account have an effective duration of zero! Recommend some medium term savings investments meanwhile. 3 to 5 years etc etc,btohqsg
She inherited my ILP  could be partly want me to earn better % and also want to earn comms too. Haha,btohqsg
Thanks all for your inputs 🙏,btohqsg

Ya i could have done it. But my ticker already moved for this month. I have to wait till next month to find out myself😅,btohqsg
I believe for ocbc  they recognise the immediate withdrawal on the day. Because from previous post  some members are doing so to prevent the MAB from being disturbed. So I thought UOB might be the same😅,btohqsg
My guess it wont based on the fact credit card payments take a while to count into the $500 spending requirement under the interest tracker  so if we apply the same behavior for the salary transfer  then we can expect the interest tracker will also take a while to recognize it.,btohqsg

Hi gurus of ocbc360  anyone knows how would OCBC compute this month's MAB  since 30th and 31st March is Saturday and Sunday?Will they use the 29th March MAB as the final MAB?Or will they update the MAB calculation one last time to account for all 31 days of March even though it is a sunday?,btohqsg
All 31 days. 29 is PH so the EOD balance is likely to be same as 28 EOD balance. Similar to 31 as Sunday with 30.,btohqsg
I see! I missed out 29th PH.Hmm and I just realised ocbc updates balances on Saturdays. I referred back to my Dec 2023 consolidated report  they do updates balances on Saturdays  as a result the last update was 30th Dec (31st being Sunday)And u are right  they do include the last day of the month even when it is a sunday.This means ledger balances doesn't change in their point of view on Sundays and ph  but MAB has a possibility of changing. Important to understand this for those gaming ocbc 360,btohqsg

Try to explore if you can benefit from this.,btohqsg
Not too good to be true. Sometime even free. Happen at times. They just treat it as customer accquire cost. If you forget to cancel next year. Charge you full price.,btohqsg
True true. Is on a renewal basis  also a way to expand customer base.,btohqsg
so they charge $102.96 but cashback 90%+? makes me wanna sign up,btohqsg
May I ask for rising dragon promotion after earmarked the fund says 100k  afterwards the balance in the account does it still get the 5% interest? Thanks,btohqsg
Oh means I get 5% on total 200k on the account now? As 100k already earmarked frozen away,btohqsg
No. You can check the table for the bonus interest tiers.,btohqsg
Yea then it's not a yes then. Thanks,btohqsg
You get bonus interest. But check the table to see how much will get the bonus interest.,btohqsg
OK I think means after the 100k earmark the balance in the bank shd be zero to max interest return. Let that locked amount saving to earn interest,btohqsg
I don't see the extra balance above get any bonus interest,btohqsg

Why u have $200k in the account? If u did not empty the account by 30 Dec  and had $100k in it  then not worth to do the rising dragon promo on the account already. Can do it on another UOB account like Stash or wait for the next promo (if any),btohqsg

Just a shout out again  buying in capitaland evoucher from keen seller for my friend  not at face value. Dm me your discount and amt you are selling  dont ask me what i offer. Just tell me your offer.,btohqsg
Same here. Buying capitalaland evoucher.Pls quote me too,btohqsg
I think it’s better if u mention what is the price u are offering for CapitaStar e vouchers.If it’s a fair deal  I’m sure many will be willing to sell.Otherwise it seems like the aim is to attract unknowing sellers to sell at lousy prices because they don’t have enough info (and the buyer knows the seller got the vouchers free from snack promo).,btohqsg
if you're looking to do the 6.8% as a new user  you can deposit up to 60k for the 6.8%. but if you're also looking to optimize sign up rewards  you can deposit up to 100k to get $880 in terms of stock rewards. if im not wrong  putting 100k should still allow you to get 6.8% returns on 60k and remaining 40k will get Fullerton SGD returns (last i checked was ~3.7-3.8%),btohqsg

Also does ShopBack counts towards HSBC 10x points? (I believe it does not - can someone help to confirm this ?) thanks!,btohqsg
ShopBack uses multiple MCCs. You need to check what is the mcc of the items you plan to buy. If it fall within the HSBC Revo whitelist  you get  otherwise  you won’t get 10x.,btohqsg
Yup I understand  but does the platform itself have its own mcc? I check on heymax that it’s mcc is 5712 which is not on HSBC revo whitelist,btohqsg
Sign up for ♾️ Heymaxhttps://hmsg.link/heymaxand get 1000 Max Miles,btohqsg
Also what kind of spend qualify for Sing save $500 requirement?I’m not too sure if 1x points also qualify,btohqsg
i think youre confused here - singsaver is independent of the points system by the credit card  so to qualify singsaver reward you just need to spend $500 with that credit card,btohqsg
Oh so basically any transaction qualifies? Even utilities bills and school fees?,btohqsg

Thanks all for the advise. Regards.,btohqsg
Haha I'm not sure if they are fake that's why I'm asking,btohqsg
Because when I tried to add my account for amex payment... on dbs digibank it shows dbs credit card as an option,btohqsg
But I'm not sure if that would show up as an cash advance or something weird. And 80 bucks seems quite little reward for the risk hm. So wondering if anyone else try before.,btohqsg
Ipaymy > uob prvi/ocbc voyage gold,btohqsg
Based on research  DBS CC can be used to pay for other CC. And it's not considered as cash advance as well.,btohqsg
I tried for Stan chart credit card but there's only option from dbs account to pay for that. So is it only amex that can be paid by dbs credit card?,btohqsg
I think some cards can some cannot. What's your SCB card?,btohqsg
Any ongoing promo outside of the ipaymy website?,btohqsg
Should check out cardup. Ipaymy has a $1 flat fee.,btohqsg

Insurance premium? They may reject early payments if too many months ahead,btohqsg
That campaign I think exclude ipaymy/cardup. U can see the tnc,btohqsg
Yes insurance. I did something like this last year end for mid of this year. They accepted it i think cause within 1 year to the actual due date,btohqsg

Only above 3.5% makes sense haha,btohqsg
If buying with 10k. The profit seems to be only 11+$ if bidding at 3.7.,btohqsg
It is ok if you have been using CPF to invest and this is just to replace a maturing Tbill  but you are right  not worth if FIRST investment  although it can be argued if you plan to do CPF Tbills long term  doesn't really matter.,btohqsg

Hi all  i did a flight booking on third party website (trip app). I didnt add any baggage allowance cos i tot buying from scoot website would be cheaper. Now that i go to manage my booking in scoot website for my return flight home back to singapore  the baggage alloowance pricing is charged in foreign currency (not in SGD). Is this correct?,btohqsg
If fly from foreign then charge is in foreign  u see if got option for scoot to convert it into sgd.,btohqsg
I dont see an option for it,btohqsg
If have a UOb credit (evol) card but applying for different one (absolute) does promo apply?,btohqsg
Then just have to pay in fcy,btohqsg
You can get 1% cashback if you pay insurance premium through giro from EGA account. Cannot charge the premium to credit card,btohqsg
Understood! Thank you for the advice 😁,btohqsg
You can use this for a start but I suggest you do your own research as the data might be a little old.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163614,btohqsg
It should be if it's clocked on/before 29 Feb. It needs to be posted before the computation of cashback (no dp). To be safe  take it as posted latest by 29 Feb  or to take the risk  posted latest 5 business days after 29 Feb  i.e. 6 Mar.Anyway it's not as good of a card anymore if you can't hit $800  or do not spend on Shopping or Transport.,btohqsg

"I suddenly thought of a ""hack"" not sure if its possible..I noted that ocbc (not sure abt other banks) dont recognise a withdrawal of funds from the accounts on a non working day  so the MAB for those days will be referenced to the previous working day's MAB.Doesnt it mean that if we transfer the fund out to somewhere during these non-working days  and put back the funds before the end of the next working day  the MAB for the month wont be affected?I was thinking if I pull out funds from ocbc this 31st March (sunday) the MAB wont be affected for the calculation of this month's interest? Correct?",btohqsg
Are you able to track which transaction is 10x?,btohqsg
I assumed payment of f&b through shopback should be straightforward 10x since it’s contactlessBut now I have to verify if the mcc is 5712 which is excluded ?,btohqsg
Then what's the point of transferring out lol,btohqsg
Move the fund to somewhere which earns something over the weekend?,btohqsg
So you transfer out on Sunday then put back on Monday?,btohqsg
Or for my case  it allows me to move the funds earlier on 31st (without affecting the MAB) instead of having to rush on 1st of april to complete the transfer.,btohqsg
As you mentioned it is a “hack” which means you never know when they will close this loophole as well.,btohqsg
Technically yes. But you still need to transfer back in by 1 Apr to maintain the MAB for Apr..And if you're talking about earning 1 day of base 0.05% interest in other banks  it's the same  they only will see it on Monday  1 Apr.,btohqsg
I honestly am also new to this so I’m not really sure how it works out.Maybe the HSBC app it self can see how many points?Sorry if there is any confusion,btohqsg
Do moomoo cash funds rewards daily interest even on weekends?,btohqsg
You can try this Sunday to deposit $1 to moomoo. Then you see if it will reflect the deposit on Sunday or Monday.,btohqsg
Yup it will be credited on Tuesday for the weekend,btohqsg
Melvyn made a good point. For this to work  whichever FI receiving the fund over the weekend  would have to recognise the transfer on the weekend  for it to be accounted as an earning to be rebated to the customer,btohqsg
How to unsubscribe to UOB rising dragon promo  money haven deduct  dont want to participate anymore.,btohqsg

"You're right. Deposit to moomoo can happen on sunday  subscribe can be done on sunday  but the interest only start counting from tuesday onwards.ie. Regarding the ""hack"" i suggest  the use case could be that we could pull funds out on sunday from ocbc  without reducing MAB of sunday. The fund would be used to initiate the subscribe in moomoo on sundayInstead of doing everything one day later as compared to above for fear of affecting MAB of sunday.Anyway  doing this or not will only means a difference of around 3% of the MAB. Only significant if the amount moved is large",btohqsg
I will try on 31st march and confirm how it affects ocbc MAB. 👍,btohqsg

Has anyone encounter this problem before?Paid for comfort via kris+Trip cost $20Kris+ charge $8 extra surchargeUsing Apple Pay- CC was charge $28But in the app it was $20 and convert 20 points to Krisflyer milesBut the $8 surcharge was never return back to my credit cardMy credit card statement is still process as $28. Am I missing out on something over here?,btohqsg
Max 8% cashback with online $250 spend assuming you spend $600 or more on that statement month. This means max $20 cashback if your Airbnb booking exceeds $250.,btohqsg
Is it posted as $28 or still pending?,btohqsg
Pending.. but shouldn’t there be another statement indicating +$8 on the statement?,btohqsg
No. It's not separate charge. But posted alr will be removed.,btohqsg
In fact  the transaction name will also change.,btohqsg
So the $28 will automatically change to $20 once posted?,btohqsg
Now with this example  i can see why@MouseHunter88mentioned the possibility of getting banned on playing the mab system if do it too many times  in that guy's case  he outrageously game the system  and duplicate his balances over several FI  over extended periods.Well for my case  i am doing it to clear out my balances at end of this month to zero out for the whole of next month  and riding on the stagnant MAB for the weekend in my advantage.I believe the disadvantage opposite case could happen to me or any other customer if i deposit my balance at a start of a month which is a sunday. Ledger balance for that sunday in ocbc's eyes would be considered a zero i suppose.,btohqsg
As long as no surcharge is imposed  should be the case.,btohqsg
Hmm ok will check in a few days again,btohqsg

Trust owned by SCB and NTUC Fairprice and insured under SDIC up to $75K,btohqsg
Is it worth to transfer shares from moomoo to webull to get the rewards?,btohqsg
Mmf rate now 3.7% +/-Share price volatile.Where else to park $?🤔,btohqsg
Also your bank deposit is SDIC insured until 75k,btohqsg
Oh yeah I was curious why 20th haven't come in. The final round they really postpone until I got it today,btohqsg
I put 100k and joined the exclusive Trust+ Gold Club.,btohqsg
what’s the perks for gold club beside getting the 3% interest?,btohqsg
nothing much. eg.special hotel rates and 1for1 GV gold clas.,btohqsg
most important is the 3% and to show off the heavy gold card to waiter  waitress and cashier lor.,btohqsg
but the heavy metal gold card not released yet.,btohqsg
You could also consider getting UOB VS to one-shot the 2k,btohqsg
oops i read wrong yeah if working money contribution  still go to sa even if frs already,btohqsg
Hi Guys  what is the best high interest bank acc in the market except moomoo? Bonus saver?,btohqsg
Just to be clear  make sure you’re not confusing bank accounts and money market funds. Moomoo is the latter,btohqsg
Sorry  noted. I need instant withdrawal that's why I am looking for bank acc. Any bank accs?,btohqsg
Honey money has plenty of youtube videos on this  should go there first if you haven’t,btohqsg
You want instant withdrawal and still see daily interest  then only Mari 2.88% and GXS 2.68%,btohqsg
Mari with Mari Invest. Up to 10K for instant redemption and withdrawal.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know for the GV gold class 1 for 1  is there any conditions? E.g. One time use one? Only can be used for weekend? I tried to ask Trust CSO  they said I will know when I qualify for the account..,btohqsg
one time use per month and first 100 redemption only.,btohqsg
anyway if want better interest make sure you use trust only if have spare funds and already put in 100k in UOB and 100k in ocbc and already also diversified to other instruments like t-bills which can get more than 3%.,btohqsg
For uob one account  if I withdraw my 100k away by end of the month to wait for the quarterly bonus campaign  would it means that this month there wouldn't be any interest? Or the interest is calculated daily?,btohqsg
interest is based on monthly average balance in the month  can topup your balance earlier in the month to make up to still get $100k monthly average balance. Btw need to withdraw by 30 Mar before 10.30pm since 31 Mar is Sunday and any transfer will be dated next business day on 1 Apr.,btohqsg
I think some mentioned to transfer before 29th to be safer  as PH followed by sat and sun  your money may not transfer out in time,btohqsg
Keep take note that this quarterly promotion from UOB is not guaranteed. So if it doesn’t happen  you lose about 4 days of interest 29-31th. Know the potential gains and losses.,btohqsg
High level method is to bump 1-27th March balance to about $114k. Then withdraw on 28th to $10. Adb should be $100 0xx. Do your own calculations. I’m stating off back of my head.This method whether uob had new promo or no. U get max interest for March still.,btohqsg

Wdym max amount in SA? Did you mean limit for top-up?,btohqsg
Yes. I saw this too. But this doesnt answer my qn on specifically SA or am i missing smthg?,btohqsg
if u 1 year old u can top up max $205 800 and let the balance roll till 55,btohqsg
Possibly a glitch in system. Maybe check for updates or check again another day?,btohqsg
What do you actually want to know or plan to do?,btohqsg

Dbs credit card $388 sign up gift has anyone received the cashback already? April already.,btohqsg
You can probably check the MCC on WeChat?,btohqsg
I think there’s no mcc on WeChat transaction..,btohqsg
🤔 it's likely they follow the MCC of the merchant,btohqsg
8 is additional charge which will be reversed unless got extra charges like ERP,btohqsg
Do u have any excel that I can refer to? I did saw many ppl use excel but no idea how to calculate the ADB,btohqsg
Found out that mcc of WeChat pay is 4816 🤔 looked thru Ocbc’s TnC and it’s not excluded  probably considered as FX category. Will proceed to make another same txn to fulfill $800 n hopefully the callback from cs on Monday confirmation is a yes,btohqsg

Hi dear all.Urgent inquiry:Did anyone use Amaze card  but have duplicated transaction?I am using amaze card for overseas physical payment in  Japan. But the 1st time payment by insert card  the machine says did not go through. Then the says did the 2nd time - which at the 2nd time I sign.However later I found out there are 2 pending payment at my UOB card.I called UOB  CSV ppl say both are approved by the UOB. But informing me to ask the merchant  to only conclude one transaction and then the other will disappear in up to 2 weeks time.I returned to the merchant  informing so  and the merchant sales person says they will inform the finance accordingly as well.Now i would like ask and consult dear ppl here  will the Amaze Card as the medium add complications for such situation.  pls let me know your experience as i am leaving Japan for SG the day after tmr. i dont have much time left here,btohqsg
As the name says  Average  Daily Balance. Average of all the end of day balances in the month. To make it even more accurate  follow the transaction date of your transactions and manually calculate for each day.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/77752Hope the merchant refunds the error charge.,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. Seems from your pinned message - so long as I contact the merchant to only claim once  not twice  it could be sorted out in this manner. Hope it all goes well.,btohqsg
I had the same issue with family mart.Eventually after 7 days. The first charge disappeared.Best for u to live chat with amaze now to log your concern.Yes amaze is the right party. Not Uob.,btohqsg

HSBC Revo is ok if directly use in Zig,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Given the S&P500's recent run  is this a bad time to start? Or does it not matter as long as you start and focus on time in the market? Have been trying to figure the most cost effective way e.g. Endowus vs IBKR,btohqsg
Depends wat ru investing with first  Cash? SRS? CPF?,btohqsg
You choices are much narrower if you are using CPF or SRS  you have the most options with Cash.,btohqsg
I agree with u  the past year has been a bull market. But I think it is personally hard to recommend against DCA as the market is ultimately going upwards. Also depends on ur risk appetite and investment timeline  T-bills and high-interest saving accounts are not bad choice either. But assuming ur young and u don't have any upcoming high commitment spending like car or house  I would still recommend SP500 for the long run.,btohqsg
What’s a good website for comparing credit cards (besides heymax)?,btohqsg
Hello masters  i have applied uob evol via singsaver and application was succesful. But why do i not see the card in my uob tmr app? Any ideas?,btohqsg
Anything I put in is cash I can set aside for at least 10 to 20 years. Will be using cash. I read that some things to consider when looking at IBKR vs Endowus (apart from performance and expense ratio) is that some funds do not incur withholding tax. Would that be a prime criteria?,btohqsg
I think the prime criteria is actually dividend tax.,btohqsg
👀 will read up on this  thanks!,btohqsg
CSPX is recommended for IBKR  however it is still subjected to the 15 percent Ireland dividend tax.,btohqsg

My PremierMiles didn’t. And I’m not the only one in the boat,btohqsg
Please elaborate. Ezlink is a local thing.,btohqsg

4miles per dollar u mean? there is no 4miles per dollar for cardup,btohqsg
the base rewards for ladys card is 0.4mpd  the bonus amt is 3.6mpd,btohqsg

Noted with thanks. I am still trying to understand which is better. If I am making a single payment for insurance 100k within next 2 weeks  my qns is:1. At 2.25% for Cardup  wld it be better to pair up DBS altitude card or UOB Privi?Any expiry to above?,btohqsg
Hi experts  am I still in time to participate in the rising dragon promo ending 30 March? Thanks,btohqsg
So is this UOB lady card better to pair up with Instarem Amaze for overseas spending? Thank you for helping  A bit confused :),btohqsg
short answer is yes but depending on which category u have chosen for the quarter,btohqsg
Yes. Just remember to calculate your aggregated funds based on 30 Dec  1030pm.,btohqsg
a better option wld be to get 2 diff cards and link it to amaze if u are projecting your spending to exceed the cap on the ladys card,btohqsg
Ok noted   good idea to link to 2 cards. Amaze instarem is good to link up mainly for overseas spending   correct?,btohqsg
yes or locally if u need to convert your expenditure to online spending to fufill the criteria,btohqsg
Ok well noted  Robinn. Thank you very much!,btohqsg
Anyone has answer for below?If I am making a single payment for insurance 100k within next 2 weeks:1. At 2.25% for Cardup  wld it be better to pair up DBS altitude card or UOB Privi?2. Any expiry to above card to convert the miles?,btohqsg
Hi Mervyn  my mthly avg balance for Dec 23 show 99k on the website. Does it mean only amount beyond 99k will qualify for the dragon promo? Thank you for your advice!,btohqsg
Should I just empty my account end of this month and hope for another rising dragon promo in April?,btohqsg
Not monthly average balance. Your end of day balance on 30 Dec 23  1030pm.,btohqsg
In order to still get interest for March  when is the earliest I can empty the account please?,btohqsg
if 30 Dec you have 100k in account then the promotion does not really helps unless you have another 100k to spare.,btohqsg
I would say UOB Privi is better as it earns u 1.4mpd compared with Altitude's 1.3mpd. May be significant to u so not sure abt thatUOB UNI$ expiry is 2years while DBS i believe has no expiry. UOB cost $25 to transfer points to your KF membership while DBS costs $27. So they are quite similar depending on how u look at it,btohqsg
I run in Indian Stock Market Looking forward to invest in HK market as wellI will be in HK in AprilAnyone want exchange knowledge? 🤝♥️,btohqsg
They look at end balance on 30-Dec 10pm for this promotion. If you didnt empty out on 30-Dec then it may not benefit in participating now.,btohqsg
Interest is calculated based on MAB  Not last day of withdrawal.To maximize the interest  your Mar MAB shall be $100k. I.e. total end day balance on Mar = $3.1milIf you plan to withdraw on 28 Mar  6pm  your total end day balance from 01-27 Mar shall be $3.1milIf you plan to withdraw on 30 Mar  6pm  your total end day balance from 01-29 Mar shall be $3.1mil,btohqsg

for me i prefer UOB cards as they are generally better than what the other banks have to offer hence i prefer pool my points across with UOB,btohqsg
