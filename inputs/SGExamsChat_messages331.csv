Cause they want us to wing it,btohqsg
When u throw them at ppl,btohqsg
I genuinely dk why its called wings,btohqsg
They shouldve just called it the conquering the mountain badge,btohqsg
And it would make more sense given the rock tjeme,btohqsg
Must be hard given there is only one type of mountain,btohqsg
I think ure thinking about minecraft,btohqsg

Anyone know the differences between the Diploma Food Science of SP  NYP & TP?,btohqsg
This one worth to do DSA?,btohqsg
i mean if u really like it and want then go ahead ah  if you have doubts dont,btohqsg
Because in the end all the diplomas are weighed the same ü§∑,btohqsg
This chanric lore is so deep,btohqsg
he who shall not be named,btohqsg
it matters if u have smt specific you wish to pursue in uni,btohqsg
Oh my god this goes back to 4-5 years ago,btohqsg
Haha üòÇ Ive been reading about this chan Ric dude,btohqsg
yeah aren't you in the group too,btohqsg
There's lore about him from like 2018-9ish,btohqsg
yall drag convo from so long a go a bit boliao leh,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZPw7gRc-VU(This will be really useful to have here),btohqsg
Watch Geog on TV is so much better.,btohqsg
I watch my bank acc drop,btohqsg
spend my last 3 dollars on popular stuff,btohqsg
Your productivity confirm go up at this cafe.,btohqsg
They serve unlimited coffee and tea.,btohqsg
So you can drink until song.,btohqsg
drink until heartbeat become like magnitude of eq,btohqsg
The only difference the coffee makes for my work is that,btohqsg
It 's good to move about.,btohqsg
Thats what my dad said 21 yrs ago,btohqsg
I see 6m qn I wan bye bye,btohqsg
You drink coffee can sleep uh?,btohqsg
idk Sia got once I slept,btohqsg
Then I fell asleep on the mrt,btohqsg
Is it cuz you sleep very late?,btohqsg
Maybe next time you try strong coffee,btohqsg
I think some people spend so much on their coffee.,btohqsg
Like my friend told me Bacha is good.,btohqsg
You drip your own is like $2+ each.,btohqsg
hiwas wondering what would an optimal route for psych passionate students / students pursuing psych be like ^^,btohqsg
Which education stage are you at,btohqsg
Do you have any univerities in mind?,btohqsg
i used to look at suss but i haven't rly looked into unis,btohqsg
can consider NUS Psych as well,btohqsg
isn't it first look at jc/poly first?,btohqsg
maybe u can get alternate opinions on the ECG Text channel on discord,btohqsg
wai y'all jump so fast into uni,btohqsg
yeah HAHAHA i didn't expect to hear abt uni straight away,btohqsg
Personally I'll recommend by shortlisting the poly w psych pathway ah,btohqsg
Bcos u said optimal route ma so we need to unds your end goal before we can share our opinions about the various routes,btohqsg
Clinical psych need masters I've heard,btohqsg
So someone should minimise the time they spend at each so called stage of education system,btohqsg
Ok not should but that is definitely a school of thought,btohqsg
How to prepare for EAE? Need to do portfolio?,btohqsg
Especially the course only sch portfolio,btohqsg
But sch portfolio everyone also hv how to standout,btohqsg
if yall looking to apply to uni,btohqsg
as a boomer im interested in seeing what yall think,btohqsg
how old do you have to be,btohqsg
anot jc tho but still yes,btohqsg
but in seriousness  there's two ways1. the slow way - rewatch lecture recording  read notes  redo tutorial qns.2. the quicker way - try doing math qns  then ask your cher for consultation  then go back practice more qns,btohqsg
i speak as someone with straight Us from JC1 to JC2 mid years,btohqsg
No point trying to whack tutorial questions,btohqsg
Until u somewhat know how it works,btohqsg
Until that point that is when u spam co sutls,btohqsg
Only can said keen in the courae,btohqsg
u try to fix ur write upLor,btohqsg
Not going DSA as JC not suitable,btohqsg
Wait get bad results in A Levels no way go NUS/NTU,btohqsg
Need portfolio of awards and achievements and a good write up,btohqsg
Maybe will google see how do portfolio,btohqsg
if you don't know how to solve the qn  no point if you keep staring at it uh. If you can figure out how to do the qns from the solutions and the notes  then kudos to you. otherwise  go seek out consult,btohqsg
i can find out from the solutions,btohqsg
I only improved after my cher forced me to attend weekly remedial consults with her LOL,btohqsg
No awards only show Sports get top 3 position,btohqsg
just work hard for it lmao,btohqsg
if got money go Australia then,btohqsg
The course COP is 11 pts,btohqsg
If u got nothing to show them then ur just wasting ur time,btohqsg
The course eg like Food Tech,btohqsg
most of the math questions apply the same concepts in the same way so once you figure it out  it becomes just a matter of practice to get faster at them,btohqsg
A portfolio needs strong leadership   awards and stuff like ur sgc is strong,btohqsg
Ur sch easiest to gather portfolio,btohqsg
Its 82748291919x easier to build portfolio there,btohqsg
My school I also not very strong portfolio I got 2 DSA offers,btohqsg
Like fr my portfolio is damn weak compared to my friends,btohqsg
Oh idk how sec sch works,btohqsg
I know here very easy have portfolio,btohqsg
hm I feel like most people just whack portfolio for the sake of it,btohqsg
Not much i went for quality over quantitiy,btohqsg
i had like 20 volunteer commitment in jc,btohqsg
when it come to apply for uni,btohqsg
once you've already demonstrated that you're someone who is willing to give back to the community,btohqsg
doesn't matter if you did 20 or 5,btohqsg
If not ur sgc also can one la,btohqsg
but the best things to have on your portfolio would be things directly related or relevant to what you're applying for,btohqsg
Btw do u take clep? Is clep hard?,btohqsg
But I see their essay is just elit but in Chinese,btohqsg
if you're doing like food tech  would be best to have taken part in competitions or have done projects related to food tech,btohqsg
The new syllabus is similar to H2 Elit,btohqsg
This kiddo takes h2 Malay lit,btohqsg
i might want to do the humanities prog  anyone who took it?,btohqsg
I heard most ppl get clepped hard,btohqsg
omg istg my grades are so tilted,btohqsg
yeah i'm aiming for ejc  they have humans prog there,btohqsg
But if everyone die won't it have bellcurve to pull u up? For clep,btohqsg
When i apply for uni I will getting cuck by humans prog ppl,btohqsg
Can forget H3 liao if H1 is F,btohqsg
Nvm GP n math I go study,btohqsg
im #1 ej fan i love ej so much,btohqsg
cannot turn back and suddenly say you want h3 middle of j2,btohqsg
U have until EOY to get ur overall high but no wings u can legit forget it HAHAH,btohqsg
but tbf I feel like I do better for my h2 cause I got more passion,btohqsg
Die die trying to understand life,btohqsg
Theyll let u promote but y2 ull die,btohqsg
Plus theyll focus on h1 and pw so ur h2 will suffer,btohqsg
Yea I see how my wa2 and Eoy,btohqsg
So if u dont push now u gonna have it rough,btohqsg
Cause next year is math first,btohqsg
Again  sadly cant if ur goal is H3,btohqsg
Take my June holiday to grind,btohqsg
if i want to go to medical field,btohqsg
need to show that you can cope with all your current subjects first,btohqsg
what subject combi should i take,btohqsg
before they let you take on H3,btohqsg
anything else is up to you,btohqsg
BCME is easier go med but if u dont enter med u r kind of stuck,btohqsg
I took pcme. Heading into neuroscience,btohqsg
like u take Chem everything can do alr,btohqsg
Coz u cant go any other decent field,btohqsg
yeah  but if you know you're going to do med  why not do Bio?,btohqsg
i don't take physics currently so im a little scared AHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
but i take combined sci üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±,btohqsg
If ur passion is into med u have to die die get in if not ull be stuck in post grad med sch path,btohqsg
Just that u need to study urself,btohqsg
If ur school don‚Äôt offer bridging,btohqsg
Ive had friends legit tell me they gonna kts if they dont get in,btohqsg
i thought combined sci must a1 or something :(,btohqsg
LOL I was offered sci stream in my school wif a D7 sci e8 math,btohqsg
depends on the JC  I think,btohqsg
eh sorry jc diff yea some  got requirement,btohqsg
i want to go ej SO BADLY,btohqsg
but their cop can k word me,btohqsg
honestly right    they say only sci subs need pre requisite,btohqsg
going for it but i have weak portfolio  the last time i played sports professionally was sec 2,btohqsg
tbh rlly tbh let‚Äôs say geog or history,btohqsg
u don‚Äôt have its abit sian cause,btohqsg
An old classmate xfer from arts to sci coz i ask her try condi,btohqsg
Even tho appeal date was over,btohqsg
heard it's a 9999999:1 chance üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
oh woah ej is alr in the third most popular place for science stream,btohqsg
how many dsa domain i can apply for?,btohqsg
i rmb when it was like 5th or 6th,btohqsg
any of you know ej seniors üò•,btohqsg
Ej sci was fking good back in2018-2019also,btohqsg
I learned more by just by doing their papers than spamming my sch stuff,btohqsg
I was the cohort meme for chem,btohqsg
Omg back the days where NY was 16,btohqsg
This one only the OG sgexams peeps and my batchmates would know one,btohqsg
My chem was bad like legit brain turn off bad. Couldnt even do mol concepts until y3 until fuzzie teach me everything from scratch one,btohqsg
3 yrs straight single digit U for chem,btohqsg
Yes all thanks to fuzzy i got B hahaha,btohqsg
That too coz the practical was scuffed,btohqsg
i was contemplating so much if I shud go glem or mob or Smth,btohqsg
i feel like EJ gonna supplant NY soon,btohqsg
Then have a good write up,btohqsg
Depends what is your meaning of bad?,btohqsg
Pcm still sane coz 3 of the subjects are math heavy,btohqsg
Bcmg is legit scuffed if ur brain cant process,btohqsg
here are some sub combi from my batch,btohqsg
I would choose geog over lit any day,btohqsg
can i dont take math in jc,btohqsg
Shud have taken ac01 instead of A02,btohqsg
eng p1 and chi p1 done üí™,btohqsg
i think i did better for chi then eng tho üò∂,btohqsg
My el also better than my cl,btohqsg
My cl better than my el,btohqsg
Partly because i use google translate for cl and not for el,btohqsg
hi lads  I need some advice on points to consider between SMU and NUS cswhat I'm considering now:points to NUS:+more renowned CS degree  generally considered best in SG+deeper theoretical  technical knowledge+hall/RC+wider range of specialisations/tracks to choose+wider selection/variety of ppl to meet/connect  especially in dorm+has an alumni network-87.5 RP - little chance of scholarshippoints to SMU:+(anecdotally) curriculum comparable to NUS/NTU+seminar based teaching and small classes = development of soft skills and more focus on each student+smaller batch = closer batch+closer to home  no need for dorm+emphasis on internships and projects+global opportunities guaranteed for every student+offered LKCSP scholarship-no SMU CS student has graduated yet  risky(?) - required second major in business - ambivalent at the momentmay I know if there are any misconceptions / other good points I should consider before making my decision HAHAany help is greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Smaller = closer not necessarily good,btohqsg
Idt smu cs is risky honestly. All cs courses locally are good but NUS one is renowned for insane rigour... but whether you can apply that knowledge to the real world is another,btohqsg
Actually real world doesnt firms dont really hire CS major for their advanced applicatioms,btohqsg
Its always the Maths  Bio Chem etc major that specialise in that field they r working in,btohqsg
That get paid > CS but there arent many,btohqsg
EJ math papers were way too easy,btohqsg
If u can solve complex problem with maths modelling  learning to translate it into code isnt very difficult,btohqsg
I was going through with my students in 2020. After a few questions  we gave up on the paper as it was too easy to bother.,btohqsg
I wonder what u think about MI maths,btohqsg
Not sure whats the implication here,btohqsg
As in no point setting easier questions,btohqsg
do you say this because of their strong reputation haha,btohqsg
I cant be bothered by reputation,btohqsg
The scope of work u find in SG,btohqsg
Doesnt really rely on repu that much,btohqsg
Impression so far is ASR set too hard. EJ set too easy.,btohqsg
U grad SMU Nus or SIT in the end if u have decent experience and portfolio,btohqsg
ucla is not considered that impressive,btohqsg
anws the idea I think is,btohqsg
Local uni is more or less same for local CS jobs,btohqsg
But why i said NUS is because eaiser to build the abovementioned,btohqsg
If yall want oversea CS jobs there is where the inequality will come in,btohqsg
Esp if ure soemone who is getting into it,btohqsg
And something that is not necessarily ur passion,btohqsg
Unless ur one of those w github and medium articles on deep learning,btohqsg
Then i dont think ud be asking this ques,btohqsg
I think it really depends on your aims and your financial needs. I recommend you to talk to seniors and look at LinkedIn as well - while there's no CS graduating batch you can look at whether SMU IS ppl managed to snag the positions you're aiming for,btohqsg
cannot underestimate starting without 40k debt,btohqsg
Reminds me of an old friend,btohqsg
But yeah I think smu and nus are similar enough you need to decide by a) cost b) environment  not so much perceived pwesteege and recognition,btohqsg
Who went UCLA to study cs,btohqsg
I went for scholarship interview before with MNC  and actually asked the head of HR opinion on why not offer for overseas.They tell me if they are looking at overseas grad  they would likely open the company there and not SG.,btohqsg
this MNC only offer local scholarships for NUS and NTU back then,btohqsg
Yes those who r good enough will just go overseas for better opp,btohqsg
A lot of our foriegn nurses just opt to going US where there is higher demand pay and opp,btohqsg
costs. A friend when LSE on MAS scholarship. But London just too expensive  so still need to fork out some more,btohqsg
shag how can they not fully cover,btohqsg
they cover basic expenses. If want a bit more then not enough lor,btohqsg
many of these overseas scholarships are in the tune of quarter million,btohqsg
Ull have to compare costs of living and other things alsl,btohqsg
my us sch all in 500k,btohqsg
my info is already 20 years ago üòÇ,btohqsg
I not sure i havnt been in contact w her for 3 yrs now,btohqsg
I went to Google for it üòÇ,btohqsg
but I don't get what has that got to do with PSC scholarship,btohqsg
I (and a lot of ppl i guess) dw the bond,btohqsg
i thought fr psc scholarship you need to serve,btohqsg
but I grad in 2008 financial crisis.The bond ensured I got a job immediately,btohqsg
if someone good enough to get satki bonded scholarship,btohqsg
Maybe i should just take the sponsorship that i was offered,btohqsg
odds are they can secure an intern conversion,btohqsg
ya  but starting with no debt gives u peace of mind,btohqsg
If it comes at an expense of mental stressors from the bonds,btohqsg
U can get out of 40k perhaps,btohqsg
Any new company u start work with  likely u are staying for at least 3 years,btohqsg
jumping every year is generally frowned upon by HR.,btohqsg
better school with lower cop = you allow yourself to stretch further = allow yourself to do well / better?,btohqsg
HAHAH everyone here is so old wth,btohqsg
can see it as 1 extra year for 40k more. Worth?,btohqsg
Those 2 schs also very well represented,btohqsg
Hmm public sector u have to pos scope every year/months,btohqsg
my 1% ambitious self wanted to go for hci with my poor results ü§ïü§ïü§ï,btohqsg
Rinse and repeat or new stuff everytime,btohqsg
just lose one pocket is all,btohqsg
yeah i just sent in my dsa form for nyjc,btohqsg
@jangyuriimsif you think you're an avg student and can be an average student in ___ jc go for lowest COP one,btohqsg
Community there preps you very well,btohqsg
tbh  im the kind who lazes a lot and causes my results to faaaaaaallll like jumping off the cliff but if i work my butt off i can give some decent results,btohqsg
honestly i wld say try to push a bit but not too much,btohqsg
I only know one person from there who didn't make it into med,btohqsg
maybe cop 1 above your o level grade can,btohqsg
The term med sch always gives me ptsd,btohqsg
ultimately regardless of school its up to you haha,btohqsg
The RI ppl know how to make a bootleg portfolio and efficiently gun for med for example,btohqsg
"you can be a scholar in a ""lesser"" school or a horrible student in a ""good"" school  orvice versa",btohqsg
i can imagine their portfolios overflowing,btohqsg
most are motivated enough to work hard to score A for PW,btohqsg
Most ri med ppl ik quite normal,btohqsg
But ull see one or two siao siao,btohqsg
thankfully no need to be stack portfolio to get in haha,btohqsg
People overrate the intellect of RI peeps or anyone from elite schools. Academics don't determine what you can do,btohqsg
o low cop schs can get q elitist btw,btohqsg
But I guess comes w the territory,btohqsg
uni can take minor or not,btohqsg
RI students are super hardworking.Not because they are much smarter. Generally much more motivated and hardworking.,btohqsg
what will uni look out for in applications,btohqsg
Academic results come as a result of the hard work.,btohqsg
You can't ignore how much of a role information plays,btohqsg
I think it's also important to make a distinction that you can be hardworking but still create bad results,btohqsg
If they know a b c leads to the outcome they want,btohqsg
i got into one uni cuz my friend message me and was like HI THIS EXISTS GO FOR IT,btohqsg
Because school genuinely upvotes those who know how to study as effectively as possible and memorize well,btohqsg
I have coached quite a num of students from nyjc who hit 90 rp too. All because they work real hard,btohqsg
hard work is always the key,btohqsg
in my j1 some of the retainees were the hardest working,btohqsg
u don't see them all the time,btohqsg
Some people sacrifice how much they sleep which can be a double-edged sword because they end up not being at their 100% during exam period,btohqsg
ya ppl shouldn't get into that toxic mentality,btohqsg
plus they may also be working wrongly,btohqsg
hmm does uni have anything is like dsa,btohqsg
That's exactly why you can work hard but still not get what you would expect,btohqsg
There are a whole lot of factors to account for the results,btohqsg
i was just trying to emphasise that its hard workandworking well,btohqsg
You can be from a poor family,btohqsg
And due to being from a poor family  it leads to the child having an unresourceful  unoptimized start,btohqsg
It's just unfortunate the world works like that,btohqsg
it's not just poor a not. It's also whether parents are supportive a not,btohqsg
I'm a full time tutor who has nothing better to do but to stick myself into students chat group,btohqsg
in my pri sch  the simple act of my dad sitting beside to struggle together with the maths questions helped greatly,btohqsg
and my mum coaching me in Chinese with a cane üòÇ,btohqsg
I could see how it is too,btohqsg
Though  this kind of method to teach people isn't truly effectively,btohqsg
Well when parents of that time are mostly O lvl grads at most...,btohqsg
It could backfire and even for the child  it is likely placing detrimental impacts,btohqsg
i waiting to enter uni same same,btohqsg
that like Yr 2004 for me,btohqsg
hi anyone knows if mi can dsa? if yes has it opened for registration?,btohqsg
at least not that I know of,btohqsg
cause mi is looking at ur r4,btohqsg
yea thats what i thought too then my teacher said can before my exams,btohqsg
for English n math if u don‚Äôt meet the requirements u can do conditional admission,btohqsg
then retake the subject in ur pu1 year,btohqsg
Hmm idts cause none of my classmates know,btohqsg
oki then ill just wait until eae then,btohqsg
yea mi doesn‚Äôt offer DSA iirc,btohqsg
U can always wait till Jae to come mi :),btohqsg
i dunno bro but why would u wanna come here üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
There are many products with the logo MI,btohqsg
Uk what‚Äôs the diff between mi and ri,btohqsg
They start wif r we start wif M,btohqsg
more of a like theres commerce stream,btohqsg
i can try for sajc but my sec 3 l1r5 abit... why cannot take sec 4üò≠,btohqsg
I arts stream so cannot speak,btohqsg
My sec 4 r5 wif e8 math 14,btohqsg
do you think they would even call me for interview if my sec 3 l1r5 is 26üò≠,btohqsg
My r5 28 I still got cjc nyjc and jpjc interview,btohqsg
my main objective is still poly eae but just a back up only,btohqsg
but sec 4 is 15 cuz i failed chineseüíî,btohqsg
omg then same cuz 8 is raw,btohqsg
no too many senior here n join yds <3,btohqsg
does that only apply to poly HAHAHA,btohqsg
Looking for friends :) pm me haha I can share my jc/poly/experience too,btohqsg
