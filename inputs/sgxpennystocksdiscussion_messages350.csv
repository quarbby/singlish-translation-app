Dear all I have added David Pan Qi as another admin in the group. He is formerly a proprietary trader and currently trades full time on his own.He‚Äôs been trading for at least 10 years and specialise in SGX market.He‚Äôs probably one of the best traders in SG I‚Äôve seen and I believe he will help make a difference with his trading plans as I too  have learnt a great deal from him.There‚Äôs a lot we can learn from him. This for sure.His trading plans will be shared through the below channel too  from time to time when he spots potential tradeshttps://t.me/sgxpennystockstradingplanWelcome@davidpan888Thanks for joining us  in our trading/investment journey.Aside to all  please note that market can change quickly and everyone needs to manage your own EP  SL  TP etc. Any potential target üéØ stated is a just a reference and it does not mean that one cannot cash out lower or higher than it. (It‚Äôs all up to market sentiments which we all have to watch closely) Also  after a counter is triggered but the counter face heavy hidden selling pressure  this could also mean that the counter is not ready to run and it is always best to exit early so as this can amount to opportunity costs.Good luck and hope everyone can learn and improve in our trading game. üôèüèª,btohqsg
