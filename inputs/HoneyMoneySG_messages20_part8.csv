Question for the experts - what would you do if you are 24 yo  SEP and trying to increase tax savings? I was taking opinions from different sources and this should be the method that I am taking.1. Top up to MA (tax savings and hit BHS ASAP)2. Top up to SRS (tax savings and invest)3. Top up to OA (housing in the future and invest)4. Only top up to SA in the futureWould love to hear the community's suggestions.,btohqsg
What’s the best credit card for high purchases?,btohqsg
Will never sign up starhub again... Cancel their plan. Still have fibre service disconnection fee.,btohqsg
No. Finish. It is not early termination. No contract still charge extra.,btohqsg
Are you already registered as SEP with CPF & IRAS? This will then determine your tax relief eligibility as a SEPFor myself I will prioritise VCMA first to hit BHS. Some prefer to do VC3A as a SEP to bump up OA  or  RSTU-SA as well,btohqsg
Yup! I’ve registered as SEP a year ago,btohqsg
Also  can I check my relief eligibility via IRAS  account?,btohqsg
Look like they having this issue quite some time. You can Google search fibre service disconnection fees. Forum and fb posts.,btohqsg
You can check under CPF  then Self emoloyed section. If you're registered then you can access it,btohqsg
OCBC 360 holders  can I check  if the interest credited for Salary is based on current month or previous month?Current month I have more pay coming in but I have lesser interestLast month I have lesser pay but more interest.,btohqsg
Depends on your tax bracket though  if it’s not very high  SRS doesn’t quite make sense,btohqsg
Top up Medisave Account is cool  go for it,btohqsg
Mm.. how much then it will make sense to do SRS?,btohqsg
The higher your tax bracket  the more you should feel incentivised to part your money that long ya,btohqsg
If it’s me  i will just take 8k tax relief by topping up MA,btohqsg
I might consider topping up May parent or spouse cpf,btohqsg
SRS when you’re older (nearer to retirement age and salary higher) then use ba,btohqsg
So young.. take some course (invest in yourself) get certified in whatever field you’re in  got tax relief for courses also leh,btohqsg
that really depends on your tax payable. SRS max tax relief is 15 300,btohqsg
You may try to contact their customer care to waive. Couple of years back I managed to get it waived ~30S$,btohqsg

CC statements do not show MCC codes... U will need to ask the retailer about it,btohqsg
Would you guys rather Top up to MA or top up to srs and invest it ? (assuming 7% returns on s&P 500),btohqsg

You can consider implications on your tax as well to determine your risk of missing out. As in if you top up within this year  you may potenyiay gain more tax relief.,btohqsg
Well I can still get the tax relief as long as I top up before Dec 2023.,btohqsg
