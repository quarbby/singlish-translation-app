If it‚Äôs not urgent  you can consider uob payment facility. They charge fee + principal to eligible uob miles card   and transfer the principal $$ to your bank account.I‚Äôll leave you to read the details,btohqsg
"nope thats ""average""the rates i have gotten are slightly better than money changer",btohqsg

$1  can use Amaze+Citi rewards mastercard to get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded. Why u using Citi premiermiles that only give 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
Can I use existing USD funds in my account?,btohqsg
So what are the local spend means? Online or physical card also can? If I want to pay via citipm,btohqsg
Yes  as long as the transactions are not found in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Yes okay  but where should it be spent? online or physical chip card usage?,btohqsg
Huh how can we tell you where to spend? It depends on what you want to buy or need to buy right? What if I tell you to spend 800 at 7-11?,btohqsg
as long ( as many ppl have mentioned) not in the exclusion list,btohqsg
sorry msg sent out of order.,btohqsg
idk why the previous msg didn't send but it doesn;t matter for premiermiles,btohqsg
For premiere miles you will get the points for ANY KIND of method of payments: in store  online  apple pay Google pay as long as NOT in exclusion list,btohqsg
Hi  may I check that the snack by income payment is charge to which mcc code? Anybody knows?,btohqsg
Where can I find the exclusion list?,btohqsg
to add on transation need to be minimally 5 SGD,btohqsg
Citi PM don‚Äôt have $5 block,btohqsg
So no point to link it with AMAZE if your are using it in SG. To link with AMAZE is for foreign transaction. But there are other alternative cards with better MPD.,btohqsg
i need to redig the link but im almost certain it does. in fact  thsi should apply for most of the citicards,btohqsg
No this is incorrect. Citibank cards get miles for every dollar spent. You might have mixed up Citi Premier miles with UOB Prvi miles.,btohqsg
Is this the exclusion list for citi premiermiles card?,btohqsg
Okay  I should not be using the citi pm card here  right?does it apply for citi rewards as well?,btohqsg
I mainly use citi premiermiles just for citi payall promo.This exclusion list applies to all the citibank cards listed. There is a separate TnC for citi rewards also,btohqsg
Paiseh  but where do i find the icon ?,btohqsg
Uob one acc has been ard for quite some time  but u can be sure they will be quick to adjust their interest rate down fast once global interest goes down. So it depends if u wan to lock in ur interest rate in ssb for 9 years or bet the interest rate will stay high for the years to come.,btohqsg
I an't seem to find the T&C  so maybe i did rmb wrongly. I've been not using my citi cards for any purchase below 5 SGD  TTATT but no matter. will be using them more now.,btohqsg
Hi does this group allow discussion about home loan interest rates?,btohqsg
I think UOB cards are the only one which uses $5 blocks?,btohqsg
no i rmb it as min transaction as 5 SGD but thereafter its not in blocks but rounded down to the nearest 1 SGD,btohqsg
How do you get the the voucher on mobile app?,btohqsg
I can't seem to find the pdf/t&c so maybe its an old one or i rmb wrong,btohqsg
For the uob rising dragon promo  how do I know if I‚Äôm eligible?,btohqsg
You signed up for investment right ? Can go down.can go down. If very sensitive pls put in FD. Don‚Äôt even come near ilp,btohqsg
Hihi  would simplygo (bus and mrt) transactions qualify to meet minimum spend for the CIMB credit card promo ?,btohqsg
Hi for those who redeemed HSBC revo points to krisflyer miles before  is it necessary to subscribe to their mileage programme? It‚Äôs my first time and i have issues redeeming krisflyer miles one-off. The customer service told me we now have to subscribe to the $40/year milage programme to redeem miles,btohqsg
Just want to confirm if thats the case,btohqsg
Have to and has always been this way. They don‚Äôt do one off redemption.,btohqsg
Have use meh  food so so only and sometimes crowded. I have like 5 entry a year and barely even use it at all for any of the years,btohqsg
