but I doubt that would happened. Then Singapore would be flooded with Cigarettes and illegal shit from Malaysia.,btohqsg
As the saying goes as long as it dun break down,btohqsg
iâ€™d be happy if itâ€™s just better than the german train line,btohqsg
just donâ€™t wanna get fucked by DB,btohqsg
Wait how reliable is German railway ?,btohqsg
you donâ€™t take the train if you want to be on time,btohqsg
Coz Japanese trains are punctual and reliable I heard,btohqsg
Like even if there is delay  is usually caused by acts of god like earthquake   storms and typhoons,btohqsg
There has been delays in Japan railway caused by factors well beyond the control of rail company,btohqsg
ahhh Trains in Europe aren't reliable...,btohqsg
Went to Amsterdam. It either always breakdown,btohqsg
Like vandalism of infrastructure or passenger fell on tracks either accidentally or intentionally,btohqsg
i only had issues with germany personally,btohqsg
Otherwise  you read the wrong Train  and it really brings you to Holland,btohqsg
Happy Chinese New Year and Holidays to everyone!,btohqsg

If not reputable might as well study in sg with higher salary,btohqsg
i mean iâ€™m beyond it alr,btohqsg
Mit sats need high score ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
There's no absolute SAT requirement at MIT  but they really want to see at least a 1520 to have a chance at being considered.ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
Mark Zuckerberg graduated from Exeter in 2002. And he scored perfect 1600 in SA,btohqsg
i got a 1520 the first time i took it haha,btohqsg
ah did your parents put you on fast track or prodigy track or something lol.,btohqsg
isn't 1520+ avg for sg student,btohqsg
if I recalled correctly the max score for SAT is 1600.,btohqsg
you need a flawless paper bruh,btohqsg
your score sounds like 95% percentile already. lol,btohqsg
i'm in the bottom 25% of MIT applicants,btohqsg
"ah might be discounted if you aren't from a Chinese descent.If they want to accept students because of ""diversity"" background lol",btohqsg
