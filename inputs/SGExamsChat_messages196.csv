shhhhh   later he tell on us,btohqsg
its more complicated than past yr papers too,btohqsg
Why worry? Tell back on him,btohqsg
im not ok with sbcs case studies in ss,btohqsg
i saw Josephine teo and i knew smth wrong was gonna happen in this source,btohqsg
My mum nag at me to study ss,btohqsg
I lied that i studied 2 hr for ss,btohqsg
but she was indeed wrong to a certain extent,btohqsg
But i studied chem and phys instead,btohqsg
‚Äúi .. have spoken the facts‚Äù,btohqsg
i only studied theme 1 and sbcs,btohqsg
I rly hate ss to the extend that i have to lie,btohqsg
she stutter in the parliament speech tho,btohqsg
sources in combi hist was really short   made me sweat,btohqsg
No one ask for an apology?,btohqsg
she said increasing minimum wage was bad,btohqsg
lmao i nearly worked for ntuc who pays 8 bucks per hour,btohqsg
then u can use ur historical knowledge to literally unpack the sources,btohqsg
ur reading it in a vacuum,btohqsg
Does anyone have pure chem last year practical paper? Can dm me?,btohqsg
esp if you're interested in history,btohqsg
Idt i can dig and find,btohqsg
My history teacher never fail to pronounce,btohqsg
Pretty sure below the chair got 1 cockroach hiding,btohqsg
My stuff plus my brother one,btohqsg
My stuff r still on the shelves LOL,btohqsg
amath tb damn good to sell,btohqsg
i rlly jealous of the all rounders who are super duper good at humanities,btohqsg
my humans is shit because of my source based,btohqsg
In the midst of process discarding my lower sec stuff to make way for more recent stuff,btohqsg
and are super duper good at everyt else too,btohqsg
Tbh i wld j give if its sch notes,btohqsg
i bought history for 20 bucks entire sec 4,btohqsg
nvm only the easy one gone,btohqsg
Particularly from those who score well,btohqsg
Do ur teachers use the slides frm the publisher as geog notes,btohqsg
Some people pronounce as nick xon,btohqsg
pls stop i have chem ptsd,btohqsg
isok its the hardwork that matters,btohqsg
Like not nixon but nick xon,btohqsg
i hope my mcq full marks,btohqsg
Tbh i didnt touch my physics tys at all,btohqsg
Chem at a higher level is basically applied physics + math,btohqsg
I tore out and did all as hw,btohqsg
i did the other schs one,btohqsg
The chem u tellin me is not even chem!!,btohqsg
but he isn't as bad as the current one soooo99,btohqsg
He made friends with China  so...,btohqsg
he pay taxes in china   but don't pay taxes in America,btohqsg
i see the spirit of the trees,btohqsg
My brother bought it but never play,btohqsg
Cuz he in camp all the time,btohqsg
I pray that I will never meet you,btohqsg
But he dw to play with his bunk mates,btohqsg
Not that the other Kranji camp people use the sch v facilities though,btohqsg
He told me he anyhow march the sergeant also dc,btohqsg
And sometimes his platoon need to do 60 pushup but the sergeant reduce to 20,btohqsg
Probably varies from sgt to sgt,btohqsg
And ntu uni also somewhr thr,btohqsg
Time to be occifer in 1GDS,btohqsg
Yeah  because linear algebra is more abstract  H2 mathematics vectors is so computational. And wordy.,btohqsg
But H2 vectors is easier to und no?,btohqsg
Theres a reason why abstract maths is a field of its own,btohqsg
The way I was taught H2 vectors impeded my broader understanding,btohqsg
Took a lot of effort to undo the learning and learn the correct way,btohqsg
It's the real mathematics. But very art not science,btohqsg
No  it is just these are the formulas  take it for it is  this is how you compute it.I hate it and I have no understanding of it,btohqsg
Also if you introduced covectors to high school students they'd be very confused,btohqsg
I was taught this in Year 1 university mathematics:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_basis,btohqsg
Cartesian coordinates are so overused that a lot of texts don't bother to differentiate between the two,btohqsg
There are also the spherical and cylindrical coordinates  among others.,btohqsg
Yeah but Cartesian is where vectors and covectors are indistinguishable,btohqsg
I had to search it  as we didn't use the term,btohqsg
I dont think is comparable to NUS,btohqsg
NUS is rly on a whole new level,btohqsg
Is that a good or bad level,btohqsg
Doesn't matter what you learn in NUS. What matters is if you are able to become an outstanding mathematician,btohqsg
Good if u like mathBad if u think u are good in math but actually not,btohqsg
Simply put  linear maps from vectors to real numbers,btohqsg
I know a mathematician that didn't like NUS. Sorry. Said it was lousy,btohqsg
No  to scalars which are elements of the field,btohqsg
Remember that in uni  we don't just assume real,btohqsg
It has to be a generic field,btohqsg
Most people  even in maths  aren't in maths to become mathematicians  let alone outstanding ones,btohqsg
Okay... But it isn't correct when people assume real  in general,btohqsg
Or do data analysis or something. I don't really know because I don't really care. Sorry,btohqsg
dancing man in the dancing world,btohqsg
what does üÖ±Ô∏èinance have to do with F1,btohqsg
It's an F1 running joke that has to do with Ferrari. The üÖ±Ô∏è to me at least is synanomous with that joke.,btohqsg
It will scare anyone not in RI,btohqsg
If you don't get 90RP  it's not the end...,btohqsg
They had 6 people who did 2H3s and got distinctions in all 9 subjects,btohqsg
There are 6 with 9 distinction and 72 with 8 distinction,btohqsg
Means double H3 and single H3,btohqsg
If they were all that good  we would see a 95+% distinction rate  with everyone else B,btohqsg
But I worry for the 2percent tho,btohqsg
But people that can do that aren't exceedingly well in one area. There is always a trade off,btohqsg
Kumar aiming for the 8 distinction,btohqsg
Like distinction in all 9 with having to cope with 2 H3s,btohqsg
Idt anyone in my sch can get 9 distinction,btohqsg
Firstly they need to take 2 H3s,btohqsg
Why u exposing me like that...,btohqsg
Or do MTL and get A,btohqsg
I actually completed 4 subject alr üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
There's movie screening on discord sia,btohqsg
i cant fucking stand them spending thousands of dollars of their parents money alone every month,btohqsg
when their only intention is to party and get laid with white people,btohqsg
I dont have the same personal experience but i think all of us can relate,btohqsg
Hmmm... So you don't like our PM Lee Hsien Loong?,btohqsg
Haizz we always see ppl flouting safe distancing laws and shit,btohqsg
Some overseas unis charge less than NUS/NTU,btohqsg
Have to count in the living expenses thou,btohqsg
Well  living in Singapore is pretty expensive...,btohqsg
The only thing you might not have to care about is accomodation I guess,btohqsg
i know like 3 people doing that alr,btohqsg
That's 3 people. Out of the thousands that go overseas and study.Some people don't go to countries where 'white people' are the majority of the populace.And even if they do  there are so many universities out there that are very good. How can you say those who go there are disgusting? When they come back to Singapore finding a job shouldn't be a problem.,btohqsg
these people literally talk about how they wanna get laid and party hard with that very race of people,btohqsg
i just didnt expect they'd stoop so low,btohqsg
to doing it while covid is still rampant,btohqsg
THREE people would change your opinion about a group consisting of thousands. Are you even serious?,btohqsg
you literally side tracked the convo,btohqsg
Because their university forces them to go back,btohqsg
being disgusting and being employable is a whole different thing,btohqsg
im referring to those people SPECIFICALLY,btohqsg
you added the generalisation for me,btohqsg
forces them to go make out with drunk fucks?,btohqsg
Did you mention these three people when you said 'them'?,btohqsg
i cant fucking stand them spending thousands of dollars of their parents money alone every month,btohqsg
and where did i generalise them,btohqsg
It seems to apply to everyone studying overseas,btohqsg
hello ! it‚Äôs abit weird to join the convo rn but um i think ur view of ppl who study overseas is very fixated,btohqsg
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT,btohqsg
not everyone goes overseas to party,btohqsg
people go overseas during this period of time cause that‚Äôs usually when the sch yr starts,btohqsg
im only referring to those who do,btohqsg
yah clearly referring to only those who do ^ ?,btohqsg
just cuz i dont specify the shit out of everything u say,btohqsg
get ur facts right before u talk so much tbh,btohqsg
i am gonna get nitpicked to death now?,btohqsg
why u even talking abt overseas kids,btohqsg
like i gotta spoonfeed the shit out of you?,btohqsg
u literally in an sg sch why give a bullshit abt others who study overseas,btohqsg
cuz i thought good of them,btohqsg
Stop being verbally abusive. Not appreciated at all.,btohqsg
and you can be a cunt to me but i cant retaliate?,btohqsg
maybe just so happen the ppl u know that study overseas go over there to party,btohqsg
but not all ppl are liddat,btohqsg
Because I don't want to talk to someone as narrow minded as you,btohqsg
and i already repeated myself 500x that i wasnt referring to all of them,btohqsg
What a waste of my time and energy,btohqsg
some ppl actually have no choice to go back overseas during this time cause it‚Äôs a requirement,btohqsg
Yes  the government has changed the policy to allow students to go back under the advisory,btohqsg
don‚Äôt blame us for talking shit when u started this convo,btohqsg
from the start u were obviously referring to most students who study overseas anyways,btohqsg
so you admit  you have 0 social skills and nitpick the shit out of what your friends say in real life as well?,btohqsg
even though they keep repeating to you that thats not what they meant,btohqsg
Hahahaha. Because your arguements are so flawed!,btohqsg
hoho i think i have pretty good social skills but i don‚Äôt think i need to show any of them to u when u aren‚Äôt even talking nice to us,btohqsg
the fuck is an argument i was just casually talking and you started berating the heck out of me,btohqsg
why the fuck will i be nice to a bunch of imbeciles,btohqsg
it ain‚Äôt fking casual when from the start u say u can‚Äôt fucking stand kids that study overseas,btohqsg
just cause they use their parents money ?,btohqsg
it ain‚Äôt ur issue in the first place so why care so much,btohqsg
if they keep using their parents money they gonna realise their in the wrong eventually so why do u need to care,btohqsg
Anyone here in applied chem at SP can dm?,btohqsg
Discussions are nice  but keep it civil  don‚Äôt be an asshole,btohqsg
lol read through the previous convos  you really seem like a very hatable person ngl,btohqsg
Okay  let‚Äôs not continue the shit,btohqsg
How you wake up so early,btohqsg

a lot of points for environment are interchangeable but theres one yr they ask ‚Äú given the difficulties  we should stop trying to save the environment‚Äù like what,btohqsg
Political difficultiesEconomical difficultiesEnvironmental difficulties (like the size of land  etc.),btohqsg
Haha environment is easy but not easy to stand out in terms of examples,btohqsg
Mainstream ones like copenhagen conference wont go far,btohqsg
Can it be written as recorded on the wrong side of the transaction,btohqsg

I put like over 10 example sia,btohqsg
Yea got plan but plan wasnt enough to beat the clock,btohqsg
I did qn11 so its like freedom of speech,btohqsg
At least u planned so got a flow in writing man,btohqsg

Point 1 social cohesion  I wrote about french muslimsPoint 2 immorality  amos yee and paedophiliaCounterargument I wrote political freedom  thai protest and HK protestRebuttal fake news damaging the same institution of democracy it claims to represent  I managed to write trump biden and tried to link it to fake news but then times up,btohqsg

The technology democracy qn was fucked,btohqsg
ya i studied a fk ton for technology,btohqsg
"Cos if u read wrong and u thought is ""society""",btohqsg
then i write until equality and equal opportunities for all,btohqsg
But did u link to democracy,btohqsg
Did you think your arguments were valid for the qs? Did u answer the qs requirements? For GP  got no right or wrong answer   just that ensure all your arguments can hold water :),btohqsg
i tot democracy = equality and equal opportunities to all,btohqsg
I think can lah  like I got structure just never finish,btohqsg
For now  can‚Äôt change anything  just focus on P2! Plan your timing well and spend at most 10 mins for AQ planning.,btohqsg
Democracy = freedom of speech  citizen right to select form of governance,btohqsg
Didn't expect enviromemtal never come out sia,btohqsg
I 100% expected a broad arts question,btohqsg
Never expect they be like music education,btohqsg
Like I tried my best to define I cry,btohqsg
I defined free society as a country which supports democracy,btohqsg
I was like trying so hard to define define define,btohqsg
I actually forgot what I wrote but like hopefully I'm still on the right track ü§ßü§ßü§ß,btohqsg
Where freedom of speech is a fundamental right afforded to every individual  but to what extent,btohqsg
Q12 is a geog student-centric qn tho,btohqsg
I just feel like dying cos never finish essay haiz,btohqsg

The phone rang in the middle of the exam,btohqsg
But how far off topic are u,btohqsg
my essay about democracy completely irrelevant,btohqsg
I am sorry for utterly messing up the GP paper. I deeply regret everything at I have done including my non-existent paraphrasing and my utterly hopeless attempt at the AQ which I unreservedly shoulder the blame for. In order to make amends  I will retake A level paper next year. Please forgive me. Once again  I am very sorry.,btohqsg
My fren wrote his essay with barely any news examples,btohqsg
He still got B for A lvls,btohqsg

Guys I just wanna know  science stream students  if your score can go FASS but not higher  will you choose FASS?,btohqsg
Non a sci stream student here but I‚Äôd consider going FASS,btohqsg
I have science friend who go art stream in uni,btohqsg
In fact one of my econs teacher is PCME + H3,btohqsg
But he end up studying econs,btohqsg
I am arts stream and I definitely want FASS haha,btohqsg
But econs is v quantitative in uni,btohqsg
But he took Game Theory I think,btohqsg
Hybrid combi here but fass is quite good I think. Depends on the courses,btohqsg
Lowkey feel that FASS shouldn't group all their majors in one single place tbh,btohqsg
It disadvantages those of us that actually want to do arts that's not Econs/Pysch/Politics,btohqsg
Anyone thinking of going the same course as me? Haha,btohqsg
If I eat KFC after every a level,btohqsg
I will gain like 10kg üòÇ,btohqsg
