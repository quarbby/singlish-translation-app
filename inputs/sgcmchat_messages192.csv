Anyone have a snap grip? Is it useful for taking photos with iPhone?,btohqsg
2 new attractions are set to open in Singapore ‚Äì a wellness attraction in the Marina Bay precinct by 2030 and a Porsche Experience Centre in Changi by 2027.https://str.sg/eHJ6,btohqsg
PEC coming to SG  atop the old unbuilt unfinished Changi Motorsports Hub,btohqsg
yay good use of tax money,btohqsg
Porsche is really invested into SG,btohqsg
especially with the launch of the Macan recently and taking over Eurokars Porsche,btohqsg
bro i see more porsche in singapore than taxi or PHV. they must be freaking printing money thanks to our market,btohqsg
diluted european version type r but type r nonetheless,btohqsg
different body  not made in japan  and not 100% sure on this one  but i believe it also made less power than the JDM 4 door body one,btohqsg
maybe they used the same one,btohqsg
oh damn so the eu one had two doors but japan had 4,btohqsg
the japan one was a totally different chassis they were totally unrelated...this european version was universally disliked and i think it was a commercial failure in all markets where you could buy the JDM vs euro. but i think in the UK market it did ok,btohqsg
the FN2R cannot be compared to the FD2R,btohqsg
ah yes the FD2R was the JDM one,btohqsg
like totally no comparison except in name only,btohqsg
diff chassis but parts like the headlights shld be same same right?,btohqsg
The FD2R is like gigachad  the FN2R is like his younger incel bro who watches andrew tate videos,btohqsg
no its totally different  body wise nothing is shared,btohqsg
since young I thought these two were different gens lol,btohqsg
yeah understandable. but they were sold at the same time  side by side depending on markets. In SG we were one of the few where you could buy both. if i remember right Kah Motor sold one (i believe the FN2) and the FD2 were parallel imports. Or it might have been the other way around,btohqsg
someone has to buy the 4 cyl shitbox macans,btohqsg
both are K20s. none of them have much similarities.,btohqsg
Kah sold the UKDM FN2s. PIs brought in the JDM spec FD2Rs,btohqsg
much like how Borneo sold the UKDM GR Yaris  and the PIs with the JDM Yaris,btohqsg
yeah thats what i remember too. I think honda forced the ADs from non japan markets to sell the FN2,btohqsg
looked awful  the Mugen kit looks okay-ish but still looks very un-Type R,btohqsg
i dunno what honda was thinking honestly. there is literally no reason to buy that 2 door shitbox where the FD2 exists,btohqsg
i suppose they wanted some exclusivity,btohqsg
i'd be fucking embarassed to drive a type r that wasnt even fucking made in japan,btohqsg
TLDR everything but the NSX DC2  DB8  EK9  FD2R and FL5,btohqsg
the FK8 and all were from the Swindon plant,btohqsg
LMAO it even weighed more and made less power,btohqsg
FL5 is now assembled back in japan,btohqsg
this is good but i wish they never went turbo,btohqsg
tbf that's to keep up with the times,btohqsg
big disappointment to me but whatever  can always buy used FD,btohqsg
euro BS regs more like it,btohqsg
but then again the K20C1 is potent as hell,btohqsg
2:25 from a light-tuned FL5 at Sepang,btohqsg
there's no better substitute for the FD2R imo,btohqsg
"CL7R doesn't have that same ""point and shoot"" handling characteristics",btohqsg
its one of the few 4 cyl cars i will not call a shitbox,btohqsg
unlike a certain other member in this group that despises the FD2R,btohqsg
lucky me  i dont know who it is,btohqsg
the FD is the only FF car that handles as well  or even better than alot of FR cars imo,btohqsg
the Honda engineers were smoking good shit.,btohqsg
you need to watch more initial d cartoons son,btohqsg
ahaha only watched the movie w jaychou ehh,btohqsg
ew the fake one  sounds like something an FN2R driver would do,btohqsg
any cars at milinia walk tdy?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm actually quite surprised that majority voted for I6/V8.i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a E90 M3 vs F80 M3 debate üëÄ@usernameusernameusernameusername,btohqsg
what i love about V8s is how many unique variants you can get with very distinct characters. You have boosty turbo v8s like koenigseggs  mclarens. Then you have thumping hemi v8s which sounds so damn sick when cammed  on idle. Then you have regular crossplane  flat crank (both turbo and NA). and each of them have their unique powerband  character and sound,btohqsg
in turn which i love Rotaries for the sake of sound & smaller displacement,btohqsg
not to mention the supercharged ones like the dodge demon and the jaguar f type which make freaking awesome V8 + supercharger whine sounds,btohqsg
13B‚Äôs are amazing  keep it stock with a twin/sequential turbo and it‚Äôs amazing. do a streetport & stick on a big turbo? worth it,btohqsg
very cool engine  too bad found in so few cars,btohqsg
the whining sound is something super underrated locally,btohqsg
i‚Äôve only ever heard it once on a RS6.,btohqsg
not enough of them on our roads for people to appreciate,btohqsg
those who install aftermarket are constantly running away üòÇ,btohqsg
especially whoever this was  i respect that build a lot especially when it caught me off guard,btohqsg
22-28 actually  but with a few touch ups 32psi,btohqsg
used to sit on the back of the bus for turbo/supercharger noises,btohqsg
back to this  i am team F80. I6 Turbo makes me feel all kinda ways,btohqsg
next poll is probably gonna be european,btohqsg
also those who vote twincharge cfm drive scirocco/jetta/golf,btohqsg
Then those who vote na drive civic? ü§£,btohqsg
