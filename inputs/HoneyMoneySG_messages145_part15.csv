If you don't mind the lack of SDIC  can try choc finance,btohqsg
u talking about uob lady? it is by posted date in calendar month  not statement month,btohqsg
they want to save money on SMS mah,btohqsg
Ok that's mean even if I spend after my statement mth   I still won't get the bonus for the 2nd $1000  that is spend right ? since both $1000 is on the same mth,btohqsg
Yup. Calender month posted transaction over 1k will only earn 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Unless I spend on the 31st Dec    hoping that the posted date is 02 Jan and after den I will get the bonus for it,btohqsg
This is such a ridiculous move for a FI,btohqsg
Paying Caltexgo with ocbc365 still eligible for petrol Cashback?,btohqsg
This is really dumb. The first login needs to have 2FA for any financial/payment related apps.,btohqsg
Probably means that you miscount and you're setting up to pay extra month(s). Check your loan dates and re-setup again.,btohqsg

HI guys  I got a Q on cardup paying for Insurance Premium via CC. On my payment notice the amt is quoted in USD. So when I am making payment rhru card up  do I need to a different account for AIA as a recipient? I could see there are 2 different accounts,btohqsg
Lousy. By right 10 000 Citi points = 4000 miles and 4000 Citi miles = 4000 miles.,btohqsg
conversion needs to pay admin fee. so have to really assess yourself whether the 'haircut' is cheaper than the admin fee paid,btohqsg
it's good for those orphan points,btohqsg
Citi should not end up with orphan points,btohqsg
Its only worth if u need to convert less than 10k miles,btohqsg
Agent paid the stamp duty of my Condo renewal and i ll pay him the 177 SGD  i am thinking to pay him via CardupI already have the Landlord registered for the rent Category with Tenancy agreement but which category to use to register the agent ( as person not business) and pay him via cardup ?,btohqsg
Any one had any idea If we sign up CRMC via singsaver.Are we still entitled for the Citi ThankYouSM Points ?,btohqsg
CardUp cannot make a personal payment to an individual unless it‚Äôs to a landlord.I asked their CS as I make monthly payments to my parents and this cannot be processed as a valid payment.,btohqsg
Quick question. I have already VCMA 8K. Do I get tax relief if I top up 8k to my SA or my parents RA?,btohqsg
No for RSTU to self. VCMA and RSTU is 1 limit.If your parents' RA haven't hit FRS  yes.,btohqsg
If I link amaze into DBS Altitude and pay using cardup  do I still earn miles?,btohqsg
There's no MasterCard version of DBS Altitude. You can charge directly to the card and earn rewards in the first place.,btohqsg
Anyway  since 2022 DBS does not award points for amaze transactions,btohqsg
Just curious does Citi Rewards still offer complimentary travel insurance?,btohqsg
you got me curious. apparently yeshttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/complimentary-travel-insurancei wouldnt use this thou,btohqsg
Hahaha you faster than me by a second.,btohqsg
Hi  for telcos bill online payment using CRMC  do we earn 10x points?,btohqsg
yes provided paid directly on telco app/website which is not via AXS,btohqsg
Any one have experience in booking flight via Skyscanner and the 3rd party booking party is Jettzy?,btohqsg
from skyscannersafter u select the travel time.u r able to see a few of the agents who sell the tickets.i will normally choose the cheapest and higher reviews,btohqsg
You know if there is any issues with flight  you have to go through the third party and not the airline company. Choose the one that has a good reputation,btohqsg
just be careful of hidden charges not stated in the Skyscanner number,btohqsg
My experience with Gotogate via Skyscanner is I did not earn Krisflyer miles after taking Scoot.,btohqsg
yea  no miles point if we book thru a third party.,btohqsg
is it? I thought you can just attach ur KF no with ur booking and it will work.,btohqsg
Kena reject. CSO replied the tickets booked via third parties  no KF miles.,btohqsg
From my experience trip.comnowadays does let you key in your FFP number  but am not 100% sure whether the miles are credited,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just wanted to check to top up touch and go in Malaysia if I use amaze + CRMC do I earn 4mpd? It been quite long I been to JB. Will need some advice from frequent traveller üò≠,btohqsg
I tot wallet top up excluded from bonus point for CRMC,btohqsg
Tng wallet recently changed its MCC from transport to ewallet. So don't use amaze + credit card as you will not earn points.,btohqsg
Okkk  I use trust card in that case,btohqsg
I got recent dp that TnG not charging 1% fee on CC top-ups  maybe can test and confirm? Haha,btohqsg

Can I check  for RM4k  would a bare UOB Visa signature be a decent choice compared to youtrip at your cpm?‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Are you also valuing 1.25 cents per mile? If so  the maths said yes.,btohqsg
Yep! Thank you! Sorry I‚Äôm not very good at math-ing üòÖ,btohqsg
"Best to look for your ""current provider""  which I guess it's M1 now  considering your email reply is from SIMBA.Not the right place for this discussion.",btohqsg
Can I check if Mari card award Cashback for telcom bill thru giro? Thk,btohqsg
