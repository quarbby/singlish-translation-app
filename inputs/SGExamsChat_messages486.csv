Hello  did anyone who applied to ntu's MATH/MAFI/MADA/MACS have to undergo a Math Qualifying Test? If so  i would like to know more abt it as I've been called to take the test but im not sure what syllabus it covers. It just says it covers O lvl A/E math and logical thinking qns,btohqsg
one of the stalls had a 18k rent,btohqsg
i mean if all they say is o level a/e math  thatâ€™s all u needa know.. like the qns may be difficult to identify concept and apply the steps but itâ€™s actually just wtv u learn in sch if u take o level  but then agn I no experience so depending on someone else to answer,btohqsg
yup itâ€™s one of them above,btohqsg
insane right.. and u think about it.. cost for the wholesale food and all.. then staff  shop display  food license,btohqsg
jae is joint admission exercise. similar to psle  upon receiving ur results  you go to the portal and select ur sch based on ur results,btohqsg
any qns abt eae and dsa ? I can answe for eae,btohqsg
IM GNNA SLEEO AND SEE UR REPLY TMR GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY,btohqsg
yea.. but itâ€™s fully aptitude based  donâ€™t look at your results  as long as u get L1R4 equal to or less than 26 nett (meaning minus off ur cca points alr) then ure admitted. 26 net is the last mark u can get for poly  any higher  youâ€™re in ite or u choose to repeat   so scoring wise itâ€™s simple,btohqsg
idk but I found out a lot of the stalls alr having existing business pre Covid so they managed to flourish before Covid and open a shop  hence being able to afford.. but for small businesses..,btohqsg
for small buisnesses...bazaars cant give profit,btohqsg
yup.. at most go to heartland bazaars,btohqsg
I feel like this yearâ€™s bazaar space was abit wasted in terms of like weird claw machine and furniture stalls and insurance and car and house,btohqsg
and the fact people r consulting for resale flats at a bazaar ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
like I see people actually sitting down and ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg

"i realise after 7pm  your use of the word ""fuck"" goes up by alot",btohqsg
girl got a bag of curse words,btohqsg
Iâ€™m kinda regretting my decision now of going to np instead of nyp,btohqsg
definitely not aptitude based if you got in,btohqsg
ok stfu siyan i got great skills,btohqsg
It was a sign for me to go to nyp,btohqsg
the poly page followed me before i even entered the first day of orientation,btohqsg
I js realised I didnâ€™t follow my own poly,btohqsg
I wanted to go to nyp when I was preparing for Os,btohqsg
I still rmb when the poly's came to my school,btohqsg
they were giving our free phone charging cables,btohqsg
but I was like I cannot lah the school look like hospital,btohqsg
Nyp also gave me a portable charger,btohqsg
mine was the poly visisted my school lol,btohqsg
then if you showed them that you followed  you will get one phone charging cable,btohqsg
my brother I have 0 posts,btohqsg

I know poly last time was looked down,btohqsg
Like poly was a second choice,btohqsg
And jc was the first choice,btohqsg
My mom wanted me to go to jcðŸ’€,btohqsg
yeah but I saw cop in 2015.. lowest cop was 17 eh.. thatâ€™s very high compared to now 20..,btohqsg
my parents wanted me go poly but i aimed for jc score,btohqsg
so i surprised them for results,btohqsg
The reason why rp is so looked down upon is due to many factors that unfortunately allign to form this imageâ€¦,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not only because of the Rjâ€™s and ungraded internshipsâ€¦but when it was first formed as a polytechnicâ€¦there was no campus,btohqsg
The pioneering batch of rp students from 2002 studied at a former government building,btohqsg
I wanna see the Jae booklet in 2000,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t go bvz of location and rj,btohqsg
Apparently the students were using the campus of moeâ€™s own headquarters,btohqsg
Rp operated out of the former moeâ€™s headquarters from2003-2005,btohqsg
Then officially moved to its current campus in 2005,btohqsg
dang u know ur sch history,btohqsg
I only know i have a fountain,btohqsg
As such you can see why people would not think very highly of rp considering it was like some prank the government pulled,btohqsg
Damn I feel bad for her,btohqsg
Like if you were to tell the public that there is a new polytechnicâ€¦but the students had no campusâ€¦.did not even have a management communityâ€¦do you think it would have went well with the public?,btohqsg
ok so that wasnâ€™t normal in 2010s..,btohqsg
That is so long ago lmao dang,btohqsg
