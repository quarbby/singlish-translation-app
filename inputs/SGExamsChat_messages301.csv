Idw say Infront of 2k ppl,btohqsg
okay inawhile wait im going relax first just eaten,btohqsg
I feel so old.... Just got mistaken as a 22 year old kid,btohqsg
im looking for place to rent urgently. if hv please dm :D,btohqsg
in a few years time  getting mistaken for a 22 year old will make you feel young,btohqsg
only worth it during lunch time to drink unlimited coffee,btohqsg
Yes and let's not go there before someone starts preaching abt it again,btohqsg
Meanwhile i look like a primary school kid cuz of my height😭😭,btohqsg
Being a physics person  my thinking is units are missing.,btohqsg
Yo I'm like 124 cm and is like...16 yrs old likeeeee yooo nth compares to this 😭😭😭,btohqsg
Wait a min you're 16 and you're 124cm?,btohqsg
can i jz say he/she haven't gave up🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
It's ok we can be short tgt hahaha  like I've always said we're not short  just more down to earth xD,btohqsg
meanwhile being tall has disadv too,btohqsg
Damn what have u been up to,btohqsg
Yall can pick up dropped money faster,btohqsg
2. ppl will ask how is the weather up there,btohqsg
Hey but people look down on us,btohqsg
If a boy has a gf taller than him  it would hurt his pride LOL,btohqsg
Is that still the case nowadays,btohqsg
Btw kinda remind me of an anime,btohqsg
whose short here ? i'm short👍,btohqsg
Its less tho the stigma remains,btohqsg
but I feel short bc most of my friends r tall :'),btohqsg
Honestly asians are short on average LOL,btohqsg
Is the shortest friend always the oldest,btohqsg
my younger sis is 170++ too,btohqsg
Wth ur sis taller than me,btohqsg
my sis tall for a girl her age,btohqsg
basically my whole fam abv average height,btohqsg
eh wait I rmb someone sent some height chart into my class chat b4 lemme find,btohqsg
disadvantage of being short: have to tiptoe just to get water from the mini pantry in hostel,btohqsg
cant use the other two shelves of the cupboard in my room cause its too high up,btohqsg
Use ur height to command others,btohqsg
my shelves rn is 185 and I find them short,btohqsg
I'M NOT EVEN IN THE 5TH PERCENTILE,btohqsg
Just curious  anybody play papa pizzeria,btohqsg
isit true that running makes u taller tho,btohqsg
Height mainly depends on ur skeletal structure,btohqsg
am I still at ur spec level@chemcer?,btohqsg
Tho usaim bolt can say otherwise,btohqsg
fasterr when climbin mountain w others,btohqsg
the black spot wasnt there before microwaving,btohqsg
just cut off black part and eat :D,btohqsg
U can run under the table  dun need duck,btohqsg
oh guess wat I ate for dinz,btohqsg
Eh only if the person is sporty HAHAHA,btohqsg
That's the driest veggie I have ever seen,btohqsg
Yeah and there are rotten spots,btohqsg
it was in the microwave for 3 mins,btohqsg
but why u microwave veggie for 3 min,btohqsg
how long should it be then,btohqsg
Or u put 1 min firdt,btohqsg
3 mins can get very hot. Vege contains a lot of water,btohqsg
but yes i was planning to have just veggies for dinner,btohqsg
Uhhhhhh do u have anything else?,btohqsg
Where can I find free jc notes,btohqsg
but if u ask my honest opinion  it's probably good to start with,btohqsg
Thanks for all of ur input,btohqsg
Thank god i dont take physicd,btohqsg
Lmao i thought ur course need rush evrything,btohqsg
Google for Resnick and Halliday for physics textbook,btohqsg
University level. It's what brought me my A,btohqsg
do half tday half tmr HAHAH,btohqsg
Btw alvls starting next week alr,btohqsg
And i havemt rly revised physics,btohqsg
really depends on your confidence level,btohqsg
Ye can do well  im still looking for summary notes,btohqsg
when I was A level  I didn't really revise for maths and physics too,btohqsg
I don't rmb asking this but does it matter what sub combi do students take if they're aiming to get into med. If I take phy/chem do I need to self study bio,btohqsg
both have equal chances. Bio may give u a smaller advantage but physics open more doors in case u dont get into medicine,btohqsg
A lvl subject is at least 5X as much as O lvl subject,btohqsg
Erm the jump for physics is like...double to triple,btohqsg
A lvl Phy is so much easier nowadays compared to 20 yrs ago,btohqsg
i regret taking f math instead of physics im dying very hard in freshmore physics now lol,btohqsg
ok la. Different paths for different people,btohqsg
Should have taken F maths and Physics both,btohqsg
wasnt expecting to go engineering tho only because only sutd accepted me while i got rejected by the other unis,btohqsg
Uni Physics - go youtube search Walter Lewin and watch his lectures,btohqsg
general currently learning gauss law ampere law and biot savart law,btohqsg
Uni level Physics or if u join JC Physics Olympiad,btohqsg
Used to train some JCs for that,btohqsg
I learned this in JC for competition. Wasn't that tough for a JC kid,btohqsg
For Gauss and Ampere law  questions are generally related to symmetry  so it's not that bad,btohqsg
Gauss and Ampere law are shortcuts for special situations instead of applying Coulomb and Biot-Savart law,btohqsg
Uncle think Elliot Anderson is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
But 20years ago didnt have pw and opposing subject,btohqsg

I actually almost gave up while in J1 cuz I went in JC via appeal route,btohqsg
that's why heck care just join the CCAs I like,btohqsg
i like math but like i cant even-,btohqsg
L1R5 13 points. Around me were GEP with 6 points,btohqsg
I only liked maths  so that's why took F Maths,btohqsg
Did u take a math major?,btohqsg
cuz I like physics after that  especially circuits,btohqsg

lol this is going to be kinda awk but i’m so confused with the scoring system for o levels 😭 also idk why reddit is down for me that’s why i’m asking this qn here HAHAHA. so basically i changed cca so i’ll probably only be able to -1 point but im planning on going poly. some of my friends say that only jc can minus -2 or -1 while poly cannot minus anything while some people say the opposite so now i also damn confused. someone help LMAO,btohqsg
more cap den anyt i hv ever seen !,btohqsg
poly can use cca point la,btohqsg
come to tp u don’t have eae guys,btohqsg
My ss Cher taught me that this source has an ulterior motive and is biased,btohqsg
She must be so proud hehe,btohqsg
the purpose of my text was to persuade students with no EAE to come to TP because base on personal experience TP has the best experience for students compared to any other poly.,btohqsg
furthermore i am a sec5 student and not a TP student. thus no bias !,btohqsg
*the woman was too stunned to speak*,btohqsg
meanwhile me who lives 1h 20 min away from tp 🤡,btohqsg
she was too surprised based on its purpose and provenance,btohqsg

Im pretty sure cjc has the shittiest facilities so pls dont come....,btohqsg

jc maybe if you are very smart haha,btohqsg
like no need to study kind of smart,btohqsg
I mean for me it was a manageable level of stress so I don't rly feel it?,btohqsg
like I feel the pressure but it's pushing me on instead of like affecting me negatively ykwim,btohqsg
It's the opposite somehow for me,btohqsg
yea idt being able to positively manage stress is the easiest thing in the world to do bah,btohqsg
it gets to a lot of ppl's head,btohqsg
yea if you can turn it into positive motivational energy good for you but its also normal to feel weighed down by stress,btohqsg

Stress is not necessarily bad per se. There's good and bad stress. If you can use the stress to help you do whatever better then it's good stress. But if it's causing negative effects then it's bad stress.,btohqsg
