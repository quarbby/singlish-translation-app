Lol reward almost equal to none,btohqsg
Can always get secured cc if the student have >10k equivalent to place in FD,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the main difference between them,btohqsg
We have shared some info here with you. The rest of info you can google n start your research.,btohqsg
Also for these credit card for tertiary students  if you missed payments  it will affect your credit card report which will affect if you what to apply bank loans and other credit cards in the future. Having a credit card doesn‚Äôt bring much as benefits to them as compared to working adults,btohqsg
Singlife Account up to $10k earns 3% / annum. Instant withdrawal via FAST,btohqsg
Anybody use Evol before and manage to receive more than $40 cashback before the nerf in Aug?,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to check for zym mobile. Can go kiosk pay with DBS Yuu and earn 10mpd? Since is a subsidiaries of Singtel,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I applied the Standard Chartered Simply Cash Credit Card using your promo code (Spend $1000 to get $500 cash rebate). Just want to check what was the Promo Code? I want to check with SC customer service if I am entitled to the promo above..,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi Chris  thanks for your reply! Is this Promo still available? I didn't manage to find this SC Credit Card promo page in your YouTube Channel..,btohqsg
Hi shifus  can i check for UOB lady card bonus UNI$ points is based on posting date or transaction date ah?,btohqsg
Yes. You can check by searching chat history ‚ÄúLady posting transaction‚Äù or read the TnC.,btohqsg
Ah got it  its posting date... i think i might be too late to secure the bound points because i just did a booking via scoot like 30mins ago hahaha,btohqsg
Will be counted Next month if missed this month.,btohqsg
Yeah i also think so  now kinda regretted not using vantage card hahaha,btohqsg
Oh why? Are you expecting to burst UOB lady cap in Oct?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to get miles/cash back for interior design fees? My id only accepts bank transfer/paynow,btohqsg
Planned a pretty last minute trip in December and from what i understand is DBS cards used transaction date to quantity for the bouns points  i thought i was slick in using the UOB lady card as well hahahah,btohqsg
I mean getting a 1.5mpd is still better than 0.4mpd on UOB lady :(,btohqsg
You still earn 4mpd with UOB for Oct what. Unless u expect to exceed UOB lady cap.,btohqsg
Oh because i am also planning to do some more bookings in October as well hahaha,btohqsg
I only managed to settle my flight but hotel accommodations isnt ready yet so i think bursting the 1k cap is pretty easy if the posting date is in October rather than September,btohqsg
I have 50k worth of renovation to pay. Can I explore using cardup + uob krisflyer?,btohqsg
Cardup yes but why uob KF?,btohqsg
Well you have time for dbs wwmc and dbs altitude (Oct promo). üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh both maxed le hahaha the total flights is around 5k for 5pax  which I've used different cards to maximise the miles game,btohqsg
Maxed for Oct? You are telling me your hotel booking will be more than 1.5k and 2k?,btohqsg
Yeah hotel i predicted it'll cost me around 4.5k total because im flying for 12 days and minimum need 2 rooms  if per night its 200 bucks it'll be $200 x 2 rooms x 11 nights,btohqsg
Coz no cap. What card would u recommend ?,btohqsg
You can split hotel bookings to prepayment and pay at hotel. Then you will have 3.5k in Oct and 2k in December to play with. Throw in UOB VS for 2k spend in Dec for a good measure.,btohqsg
"Wait this is new to me  what do u mean by doing the ""prepayment and pay at hotel"" ?",btohqsg
Assuming if i were to charge 2k for hotel booking  do i spilt the charge after the posting is done in my card or do i opt in to pay at hotel?,btohqsg
Some hotels/travel site will charge you right away when you book. Alternatively  some will also allow you to pay when you are there.,btohqsg
Or are you staying 11 days in 1 hotel? üòÖ,btohqsg
I'm making a few assumptions about your trip  such as you will have more than 2 hotels to book.,btohqsg
If u have access to that  yes. 1.5mpd is way better than 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Yeah we've planned for a total of 4 different hotels to stay at  but i think we prolly be using agoda orbooking.com,btohqsg
"Ya Agoda orbooking.comyou can filter by ""Pay Now"" or ""Pay At Hotel"".",btohqsg
If u can get dbs vantage  maybe it's time to upgrade to uob lady sol too. üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh nice okay  i also realised that DBS Altitude is running a promotion where you'll get 5mpd for overseas spending in decemeber  do u still get 5mpd if i were to pay at the hotel in sgd or must it be via their currency (yen) for it to quantity for the promotion ah,btohqsg
"Yeah i was thinking of upgrading also hahahah but because previously i dont see a need for it  but now i think its always better to upgrade for the ""just in case"" scenario hahahah",btohqsg
There are 2 periods for dbs Altitude 5mpd.Oct online booking (via Agoda booking.com) or flight tix will get 5mpd. This can be any currency. Min 1k  max 2k.Nov - Dec: need to be foreign currency charged to the card. Min 1k  max 2k.,btohqsg
Oh needs to be foreign currency for December promotion hmmm  cuz i am thinking whether is it worth it to pay the fees/poor fx conversion for those miles or is it better to just use a card like youtrip/trustbank,btohqsg
3.25% for 5mpd is worth it for my own value of miles. You gotta do your own calc and see if it's worth for you. Alternatively  you can get another human to apply for 2nd dbs Altitude to maximize Oct 5mpd promo.,btohqsg
Ah okay  lucky still got some time for me to do some calculations for my miles accumulation journey  thanks for ur help Anthony!! Really appreciate ur advice!!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check and have some opinions if this promo is worth? The maintenance period I think is 3 months  how to calculate if it‚Äôs better to get 25k miles vs investing the 100k in money market fund. Thank you üôè,btohqsg
