Hello everyone  wanted to ask if FRS is met in SA( which means no more tax relief of 8k for rstu)  do we then channel this tax relief over to SRS?,btohqsg
Do note that a personal income tax relief cap of $80 000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs& SRS yearly limit is $15 300,btohqsg
You can try topping up your MA to meet the BHS.,btohqsg
The same apply if scan QR code on cdg cab?,btohqsg
How about scan QR code on cdg cabs?,btohqsg
I recall Scan QR is for PayLah or PayNow ü§î.. I stand corrected by the folks here.,btohqsg
must know that to maximise returns  its not just contributing but using it to invest as well. so its not risk free gains like rtsu. plus eventually you will get taxed on it at 50%,btohqsg
Do NTUC vouchers count towards the $350 spend required for the DBS Yuu amex offer?,btohqsg
assuming u already retired  and u withdraw $120k per year  u only pay $4k tax on the amount,btohqsg
if withdraw 80k is $1.7k tax,btohqsg
so don't be too scared about paying tax on SRS withdrawals,btohqsg
Does that mean after retired  if we withdraw SRS amount that is equal to tax relief amount  we won‚Äôt get tax at all ?,btohqsg
yes  but can only withdraw in max 10 years,btohqsg
How about after 10 years we continue to withdraw the amount that equal to tax relief amount  are they going to tax us? At what rate?,btohqsg
only 10 years  start from 1st withdrawal,btohqsg
means u will withdraw $40k x 10 years  = $400k,btohqsg
Yeap! 20k and below (50% of withdrawal Amt) per year is not taxable.,btohqsg
not scared  but need to be informed then you know what is the optimal plan for yourself as everyone has different circumstance,btohqsg
If on 11th year and no income after retired  I withdraw $2k from SRS  $1k (50%) is taxable? Then at what rate?,btohqsg
you have to withdraw all in 10 years. 10th year everything left is withdrawn and taxed at 50%,btohqsg
first 20k of each year is non-taxable,btohqsg

Anyone used StanChart bonus saver? Is it better than UOB one?,btohqsg
I believe it‚Äôs 22k. I asked IRAS before,btohqsg
Is that mean we should put max of 400k of srs?,btohqsg
Oh so that‚Äôs mean 22k x 2 x 10 years = 440k max will no pay tax,btohqsg
