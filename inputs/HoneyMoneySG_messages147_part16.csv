Where can i find this information?,btohqsg
Have anyone try to transfer from own OCBC acc to own UOB acc in large amount (e.g. 150k) recently? Will bank block / hold the transaction?Looking to transfer lump sum on 31/1 for UOB Lunar New Year Pot of Gold.,btohqsg
Shall you transfer today? Interest earned for $150k in ocbc is less than $150k in UOB One? Correct?,btohqsg
This is a good example of why I say Uob earmark promo is effectively a 6 month lock in.1. You have fears of such incidents if u only transfer in on last day2. The amount u move in on last day  even if successful  will not earn 4% pa.3. If I was participating in the Uob earmark promo which requires me to bring in the money by 31st January 2025  I would have funded by account on 2nd January 2025 with $155 000 so my adb for January 2025 is $150k.,btohqsg
make sense too...OCBC will give 4.6% (salary  save  spent) for $100k,btohqsg
"boosting it to 150k by ""borrowing"" from my spouse üòÖ",btohqsg
That means you will transfer $100k from ocbc to uob only.,btohqsg
Yeah  sort of. Recently MAS has regulation for bank to block transaction >25k / drain down to 50% of the account. So wonder anyone experience before.,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-framework-holds-financial-institutions-telcos-accountable-to-scam-victims-kicks-in-on-dec-16Means to transfer >25k  will need a few days to do so,btohqsg
So far I only encountered it for cimb transfer to own scb. Locked until phone officer call for verification.Other banks not yet but it‚Äôs implied it can take place anytime from 16 December.Thus would never recommend Just in Time Warrior behaviour.,btohqsg
Yours lowest so far ü§£ got 2k and 3k ones  harder to hit.,btohqsg

Someone sleeping on the job? I can't recall there was any of such late update in the past... Tho I remembered once or twice  we should only send the sms after 10am? So hopeful the update will be out soon!,btohqsg
