Auction: You pay $98.24 per unitNow: You sell at $98.31 per unit  you made only $0.07 per unit = 0.07% in 15 days = 1.7% p.a.And that's even assuming you can sell exactly at $98.31  without any fees/spread/slippage,btohqsg
Oops... Sorry I was confused. The face value is $100Upon maturity  I will receive $100/unit  hence it only makes sense to sell if the price goes above $100.Thanks  this is my first TBills.,btohqsg
There is no interest received upfront for Tbills. Wrong concept.You merely bought a Tbills at a discount from 100.So in your case. You paid $98.24.,btohqsg

it will never be above $100 lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs very true. Because there is no coupon.,btohqsg
Is topping up CPF still an option now?,btohqsg
Assuming a CPF member can do own investment using CPF money n can achieve return more than 6% per year  if the member prefers to keep minimum CPF in RA  ie BRS  what shall the member needs to do now on the extra CPF money in OA n SA before reaching 55 to avoid the money to be locked in RA to meet FRS?,btohqsg
No action needed now.Pledge property and Withdraw excess above BRS when 55 Loh.,btohqsg
I just request to credit krisflyer miles from Citibank on wed. Today like 3rd day already credited. Like so fast I thought they say 2 weeks,btohqsg
If selling the property in the future  part of the sell proceeds will go back to RA to meet FRS?,btohqsg
Uob and DBS also same ?,btohqsg
Cuz UOB need to enrol frequent flyer conversion. I go redeem already then sign up for the frequent flyer,btohqsg
Ok somebody asked this about SA investments too.I‚Äôm not sure of the answer but I doubt it will be auto ‚Äúlocked‚Äù into RA.My guess is you will be given one chance to either route it into locked RA or into 2.5% OA.,btohqsg
I have UOB  DBS  HSBC and Citibank. Idk why I have so many cards then my miles all scattered üòÖ want my miles all faster credit then can book plane le. ‚úàÔ∏è,btohqsg
Less one thing to worry about. After that need to research on the things to do ü§£ and how to travel in Japan,btohqsg
Should focus on 2Uob and Citibank best in my view.,btohqsg
Uob lady card. Only specific category üòÖ,btohqsg
Uob got so many cards. And their miles pool. Nobody can beat this,btohqsg
Basically I had so many cards cuz I tend to burst my 1k limit. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Uob and Citibank can‚Äôt use for travel. Like plane tickets or travel agency . Actually my uob only 1 category & it‚Äôs not travel . üòÇ,btohqsg
Uob can ah  citi u mean reward and smrt?,btohqsg
I use Citi reward card. Then uob lady  did not select travel. Too troublesome to keep changing.,btohqsg
It is very easy to change cat for uob lady to be honest  finding it too troublesome then u dont earn miles that fast then.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt travel frequently. When I need to travel then need to buy immediately that kind. Not like I want change can immediately change. Need wait next quarter which I have no patience üòÇ,btohqsg
So I save my anxiety just stick to 1.,btohqsg
How long will it take for the points to be granted after buying an air tickets using dbs cards? immediately or after the air ticket used up? sayi bought in jan 25  when will the point reflected in my rewards?,btohqsg
Base point when transaction posted  bonus point depend on card tnc,btohqsg
you would have used your OA to pay the flat you're selling. so that amount + accrued interest goes back to OA. Assuming you'll buy another flat to live in  then you can pledge that flat and keep RA at BRS level,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am looking to invest my spare change every end of the week and was wondering if there are any apps out there to help with that? Ideally to invest in S&P 500 if possible and that it allows fractional shares investment.I was introduced to SYFE and CMC invest  but CMC doesn‚Äôt allow fractional share investing and SYFE I am using it for other purpose. Any other recommendation  please?,btohqsg
Hi guys  i‚Äôll be moving to Singapore at the end of the month and was wondering what would be your recommendation for the best welcome offer/credit card at the moment? I‚Äôve been looking around and was leaning towards UOB one account + ladys card(for travel)+ krisflyer CC (for day to day spend other than travel). Looking for a good mile strategy here.Thanks a lot! üôèüèª,btohqsg
Why is this? What difference does it make,btohqsg
Can I confirm that I can charge my insurance premiums from Prudential to UOB One cc to contribute to the $500 spend? Because heard from another friend only insurance bought from UOB eligible,btohqsg
Top up MA first if it is almost full  don't need to set aside for rstu,btohqsg
Hi all i have some very important questions hope someone has the answer.1) Once i reach 55 and chose FRS  the 4% earn in my RA will be kept in my RA or put in CPF common pool?2) Once i reach 65  and i chose FRS at 55  can i upgrade to ERS or downgrade to BRS?3) If i upgrade to ERS at 65  the amount i need to top up will be the prevailing sum at that point of time when i was 65 or the ERS when i was at 55 back then?4) I understand the interest earn from cpf life will go into common pool. if i chose ERS and set aside 419k at 55 in RA  the amount will become 586k when i reach 65. if i die at 65 before i started collected my cpf life  will my beneficiary get 586k or 419k?5) If i continue to work beyond 55  my cpf contribution will all go to OA since there is no more SA?These are some burning questions hope someone can help to answer. Thank you.,btohqsg

I think the new rules is after 55 SA+OA FRS will go to RA ( the rest above for SA will go to OA),btohqsg
1. Once you hit 55  RA will be formed using your SA (first) and OA monies  until FRS. For now (till the CPF changes take effect)  you can withdraw any amounts from OA/SA after RA is reached FRS. You can withdraw amounts in RA (less top-ups to SA/RA  interest earned in RA) till BRS if you decide to pledge your HDB  else your RA will be purely used for CPF life from 65. Scroll and up read on previous conversations on what will happen after CPF changes take effect. Interests earned in the respective accounts will always be deposited into the respective accounts (i.e. interest earned in CPF LIFE premiums will deposited to your CPF LIFE premiums at the floor rate of 4% once you start the CPF LIFE payouts).2. After 55  you can top-up RA to hit ERS. But once you top-up RA  you cannot reverse it. Withdrawal to BRS as stated in point 1.3. ERS will be 3x (4x after CPF changes) of your BRS. Withdrawal to BRS as stated in point 1.4. You can read about nomination of CPF on how the monies are distributed to your nominees here:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/account-services/providing-for-your-loved-ones/making-a-cpf-nomination5. Once the CPF changes take effect  your contributions will be split amongst OA  RA and MA.,btohqsg
1) I hear from my colleagues said ( he 60) 4% will go to RA   till 65 or you redraw month payment (70 you must redraw) .Than the 4% will go to the pool,btohqsg
$500 spend for UOB One bonus interest  yes. $500 minimum spending for UOB One card  no.,btohqsg
I would suggest to change UOB lady category to travel. For your other spends use UOB PPV and UOB visa signature. These give you 4 mpd up to $3K. Then use Citi rewards w Amaze for another $1k earn 4 mpd,btohqsg
5) will go OA if you hit FRS    if not goto RA . I think this is the new change.Not very sure,btohqsg
üëç true yeah this way cut down on my dbs bah üòÇ the 6x points also end on March  I swop now to travel also same üòÖüòÖ 4x. Hopefully will extend again üòÜ,btohqsg
For the funds earmarked in the uob rising dragon promo   this is my current balance above . Not sure why my  available balance is 670.35. Means I can still spend anything within this 670.35?,btohqsg
Because the cash credit of 588 has been credited.,btohqsg
Yes correct sawed it  but how do I know how much of $ can use from the uob 1 debit card ? As have insurance payments to make,btohqsg
Hi which credit card (master/Vis) can earn point / rebate for education payment?,btohqsg
Yes  if didn't hit FRS  u only can draw 5k one time out. Rest of oa and SA go into Ra.Problem is for those already hit FRS  SA cannot continue earn 4% interests after 55. All go to OA which earn 2.5%,btohqsg
Can transfer to RA if still want to get the 4%,btohqsg
But u don't have flexibility anymore to withdraw anytime,btohqsg
