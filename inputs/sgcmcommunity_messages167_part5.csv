Chee hong tat alr say he not gna do anything,btohqsg
Correct  so without any intervention  the COE pricing will just naturally rise. It's just a matter of time before it (owning a car) becomes as expensive as owning a HDB flat.,btohqsg

Actually what can they do though  there is close to 1m vehicle in Singapore. Traffic also more or less revert back to pre-covid. If Singaporean can stomach 6 figure COE  government might even try to reduce the car population and restrict COE for the next few years 😞,btohqsg
Actually  SG is the only country that stops drivers from owning the cars indefinitely.  Most SG cars are in general below 20 years old. Other countries have the option to drive their cars until it can no longer be repaired.,btohqsg
PHV cars also separate out like taxi  pay PQP,btohqsg

PHV cars  whether COE high or low  they still win. COE UP  rental go up.,btohqsg

then u see now PHV population went up  but my grab fare got cheaper meh? still higher leh  supposedly demand vs supply,btohqsg
now supply of cars so high  demand still high cus ppl cannot afford,btohqsg
"I doubt they stop PHV from growing  Grab is establishing itself as one of the big ""local"" company that employ numerous Singaporean. Many people also get used to the convenient of grabbing around. Most likely they will be here to stay",btohqsg
