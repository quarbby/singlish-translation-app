I mean calorie mate is a snack,btohqsg
Anyways  what do you do with your stuff after A Levels?,btohqsg
Do you throw them away or keep them?,btohqsg
Wouldn't they already have new stuff from their teachers?,btohqsg
Yeah  they'll get the new stuff then.,btohqsg
Wait  Calorie Mate was only in MGS3 if I recall correctly.,btohqsg
scan them and add to the holy grail google drive,btohqsg
I only have H1 Math stuff.,btohqsg
It's all school papers from the previous years which is already on the holy grail.,btohqsg
I was referring more to notes.If it is school papers  you could either give to a junior since it is printed  or bring to the nearby blue recycling bin for disposal  or give to a garang guni man to dispose it.,btohqsg
We use a lot of papers while teaching or studying  no choice  so try to reduce environmental impact after that where possible  however little.,btohqsg
Give personal stuff  not sch stuff,btohqsg
my trace tgt app abit rabz,btohqsg
like i cant scan my phone on the tap tap thingy,btohqsg
Here in the mall I at,btohqsg
I don't have any  I just do school stuff.,btohqsg
idk is it some new oipdate then got glitch,btohqsg
Thought all phone should have alr,btohqsg
btw tracetogether app doesn‚Äôt use nfc,btohqsg
Still doesnt work for mine suddenly,btohqsg
Yup  android is kinda on or off,btohqsg
Feels like doesn't work as well,btohqsg
I WAS STUCK GOING UP AND DOWN THE ENTRANCE,btohqsg
PPARENTLY CUZ MY PHONE AUTO CONNECT TO THE MALL WIFI ALSO,btohqsg
then i try to tap out IT WASNT WORKING,btohqsg
u cant be telling me my bluetooth spoilt right im literally wearing airpods,btohqsg
I placed the token somewhere deep in my bag,btohqsg
All i got to do is squat a little and the thingy will be scanned,btohqsg
no batt until the dust be settling all over it,btohqsg
what yall still doin at this time üò≠,btohqsg
plsss post o‚Äôs is SO BORING,btohqsg
yes sir i'll go work now,btohqsg
I am self studying F math,btohqsg
Where are u planning to further studies after Os,btohqsg
If is JC i recommend u to get a headstart to prepare. I can tell u what topics to self-study (pm me later the admins here say i want to advertise again),btohqsg
but either way ur ct1 grade can use as toilet paper,btohqsg
It good to have a headstart. So u have more time to understand the hardest topic,btohqsg
And also u must get used to the tediousness of H2 math,btohqsg
I find A math ok ah,btohqsg
For A math is like what,btohqsg
But H2 math Paper 1 was like 20 page long,btohqsg
Sometimes is not about exam...students know how to solve exam qn but doesn't mean they understood the topics.,btohqsg
Bedok gonna fail his ippt lol,btohqsg
Not if he climbs mountain w cat,btohqsg
Nah he cannot be fast as cat,btohqsg
Train for SOC (standard obstacle course),btohqsg
Bedok aint gonna climb over the wall  he gonna lift the wall and crawl under,btohqsg
Ppl go into jc with no knowledge of it at all and get destroyed in ct1,btohqsg
But at the end of the day by a levels it's just another subject lor,btohqsg
So it's more impt to after the post o/ip Yr 4 period to explore what you wanna do,btohqsg
I proudly got 9/25 in my first test lol,btohqsg
^then when u go jc ull be in better shape to study and face the bs in jc,btohqsg
Good also. What u plan to work after uni  the planning actually starts from sec 3 imo,btohqsg
HAHAH no leh I think planning so for ahead only rly applies for overseas,btohqsg
E.g. no add math means go JC will die at h2 math,btohqsg
No h2 math u are out for some courses,btohqsg
if so then take sats lo,btohqsg
Eg I 90 pointer but cuz I didn't go the specialised programs from jc I'm disadvantaged for us unis,btohqsg
if so js take sats for fun if u want,btohqsg
But if you not looking for that kind then tTBH don't need stress so much abt outcome j take things one day at a time lor,btohqsg
some say go ox must have 4 h2s and 1 h3 or wtv but shrugs,btohqsg
my friend takes further math and h3 and hes aiming for mitt,btohqsg
I know 4h2 and 2 h3,btohqsg
4h2 and 1 h3 is not that uncommon,btohqsg
Go read on uni course prerequisite,btohqsg
cuz i only take h1 math,btohqsg
ik amath is kinda useless for h1 math,btohqsg
I shared yearly with parents on uni info,btohqsg
H1 u can go social sci,btohqsg
okay not useless bah but sometimes the skills arent transferable,btohqsg
Even business analytics u need h2,btohqsg
Many are unaware and then regret when go jc,btohqsg
I feel jc shld just take 4h2,btohqsg
That they are not offered the subjecy combi at jc,btohqsg
Can always drop in the future,btohqsg
But a lot harder to take up 4h2 from 3h2 imo,btohqsg
U are from the top jc?,btohqsg
But not for middle tier and below,btohqsg
Whats the h2 policy for the other jcs ah,btohqsg
E.g. raw L1R5 single digit  or for foreign students on scholarships,btohqsg
I come across student no add math no pure sci go jc,btohqsg
Cannot cope and withdraw after 1 year,btohqsg
They couldn't change subject combi ah,btohqsg
Difficult. No pure sci unless go arts but they may not have experience in those sub also die,btohqsg
So sec 3 is crucial tbh but many say wait after Os then decide...abit too late,btohqsg
Subject combi choose early but portfolio no need rush so much?,btohqsg
To me grades first then portfolio,btohqsg
Not say portfolio not impt but no pt being president of something and buang all exams,btohqsg
Back when I in jc everyone stressing over portfolio for med,btohqsg
TO the point where it harm their results,btohqsg
I think the overemphasis on portfolio in all jcs leh HAHAH,btohqsg
Not for the middle or lower tier ones,btohqsg
To let my friend teach her H2 math,btohqsg
And she cannot cope with the rigour of H2 math,btohqsg
Too bad no ads...if not i can do a second rd of sharing on what JC life is like...before u guys choose jc or poly,btohqsg
I taught full time in both paths so i kinda know the differences,btohqsg
Admin later say i am doing ads again,btohqsg
1 doing quite well. She take A level this year.,btohqsg
Then another one just drop out from JC to go poly.,btohqsg
But i think i recorded the webinar i conducted just last sun...any one who just ended Os can pm me...i can share the link (after i find it),btohqsg
I cannot post here later i get banned,btohqsg
If really want to do well for H2 math without A math. Should think twice.even for me H2 math is a huge jump from A math.,btohqsg
Shld read up a bit on the topics but like don't mug for it outright before jc starts,btohqsg
Those interested can pm me...i can suggest what topics to begin first...anyhow pick a topic also wun work well esp if self studying,btohqsg
just follow the order of topics that the jc is gonna follow,btohqsg
cjc njc starts w vectors iirc,btohqsg
Not true...there is a gap between new add math and h2 math,btohqsg
o i think vectors shld read up on the others not as necessary,btohqsg
Some topics not in add math jc may not teach and treat as assumed knowledge,btohqsg
Share with me  then I share for you.I share is not ad because I gain nothing from it. üôàüòÅ,btohqsg
Anyone need help O A level pm me,btohqsg
Or if they just wanna prep for jc/O level/ As,btohqsg
true but not that true. i was in comb sci and i still graduated jc. sure it was tough and i din get to top tier uni but i got into comp sci which is what i wanted and now im getting straight Asbut i can understand what youre gettin at cuz i didnt like sci  but i took H2 computing so i didn't really suffer as much,btohqsg
But good that you are doing well üëç,btohqsg
Anyone need ss or geog help pm pm,btohqsg
I mean if u work for it,btohqsg
Should ask in the homework channel,btohqsg
I v long never open disc alr,btohqsg
U pro u take H2 math lah KEKW.  See whether easy a not.,btohqsg
If u suck at amath don't take h2 math,btohqsg
I mean if u mug not that hard,btohqsg
Maybe I just suck at math hehe,btohqsg
I rmb 1 day before my h2 math exam,btohqsg
I was playing game all the way,btohqsg
I was doing 1 paper. Then i was like fk it lah. Dun do lah.,btohqsg
In my heart. I was not very confident.,btohqsg
Cos i did not practice enough u get what i mean?,btohqsg
I redo everything for you leh,btohqsg
Including the CLT i also do,btohqsg
If you get A1 thank me ah,btohqsg
