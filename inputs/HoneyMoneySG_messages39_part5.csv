Hi all. I've enrolled on a Singsaver EGA promotion that ended 31 Jan and lo / behold  I just got set up. So  I'm assuming the promotion is off right? Cos it's not clear promotion ends = for application or for actual opening. Cos I will only receive email 120 to 150 days...,btohqsg
if you enrolled this month with March 0  then you are entitled 4.35% x 4 months  if you topped up 2K and do 5 FAST  additional 1% for everyday+ promo,btohqsg
suggest may check with CSR which promo you are in first..,btohqsg
To be eligible for this Promotion (‚ÄúEligible Customer‚Äù)  both New and Existing HSBCcustomers who hold an Eligible Account must successfully register by sending an SMS with therelevant info in the following format to 74722 within the Promotional Period:EGA<space>First 9-digit of their Everyday Global Account number (e.g. EGA 123456789),btohqsg

My IC linked to my POSB bank alrd tho :(,btohqsg
Posted date. It depends on when the merchant or org posted the transaction. Posting date is outside the bank and our control.,btohqsg
One reason is because of bad credit rating as what is said. The other could be we have already many credit facilities. There might be other reasons. Cimb or any bank are not obligated to disclose rejection reasons to customers. Guess the only way is for us to review the below.https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.html,btohqsg
