If you die die want go poly  would recommend pfp  esp since heard a lot of good things from it,btohqsg
It's up to you but I would really recommend getting the result first and making the decision then,btohqsg
I do rlly want to go pfp,btohqsg

This is the reason why alot of people of this generation said life was hard.. it puts into a perspective that is unlike anything you will ever get to experience,btohqsg
literally for 40+ yrs of their life   they were always in a world wide struggle of some sort not like the personal struggles so many of us experience today,btohqsg
I rather go to war and do trough great depression than study,btohqsg
By the way what is your opinion on business engineering?,btohqsg
Like is it a good job?,btohqsg
Yes both their generation  our parents generation and even our generation face struggles..But their generation faced worldwide struggles  something our parents and our generation will hardly ever get to experience again.the struggles our parents and now us faced are personal struggles where one if they wanted to could change their future  the people of those times could not..Its so poignant because it puts into perspective that this portion of the human experience is unlikely ever to get experienced by us,btohqsg
True especially since there is a human right law,btohqsg
This impression is also why you find the people that fought in ww1/ww2 are so reluctant to talk about their experiences,btohqsg

But tbh those born after 2008 is all gone case,btohqsg
when you look at the accomplishments of this gen of ppl born in the 1900s..its literally remarkleble what they have done in 100 years,btohqsg
