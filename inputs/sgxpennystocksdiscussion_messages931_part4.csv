🚀It's Roaring Time.🚀🎯The Nasdaq rose sharply after remaining pretty flat through the early trading hours. This marks the seventh record close of the year for the index. The S&P 500 almost achieved a record close. It was a risk on the day with bond yields falling. With tons of cash on the sideline  investors seem ready to buy the dip with any pullback.🎯The Producer Price Index came in hotter than expected. This initially caused jitters  but they faded as revisions to March's figure allayed some fear. Traders are now focusing on today's CPI data  which is expected to come in hotter yet again  although traders are warming to the idea of a possible September rate cut.🎯Due to their sizeable short pool  meme stocks are also back in the game  with Gamestop and AMC Entertainment rising sharply. There is a clear trend that Robinhood could benefit from the frenzy retail repurchasing craze should this meme phenomenon persist  just like in 2021.🎯Given the rise in stock prices yesterday  it seems to have been a tricky day. As often  a green day prior to the CPI release does not bode well for the actual data day. So  it is to be seen this time round. As for traders  the summer rally dream is here to stay unless we get really sizzling inflation data.Till then  make love with the new reality.Jordan.,btohqsg
