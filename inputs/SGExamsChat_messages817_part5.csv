I prob do internship all the way till i graduate,btohqsg
Ofc do expect finding it harder to apply for internships in y1/2,btohqsg
Now almost all majors require at least 1 intern stint,btohqsg
Real estate agent like getting hard ever since the HDB portal comes out,btohqsg
You still can sell condos and private properties though,btohqsg
maybe you can see from your first sem if you're interested in the engineering side of things lol,btohqsg
Dk eh feel like applying to IEM,btohqsg
But i think y1 not really good gauge,btohqsg
which is a good thing imo,btohqsg
Coz it is mostly foundation stuff,btohqsg
go for it if it's smth you're into,btohqsg
I mean even you want to do internships,btohqsg
Also must do something that you feel that you want to go there in the future,btohqsg
A bit pointless if you chiong internship all the way but ended up just doing it for fomo,btohqsg
If u want to change course  do so early  there is a limit on how many modules u can map over as electives so u wun hv to grad later,btohqsg
Some do it for the money too especially those high paying ones,btohqsg
If only my time has those high paying ones,btohqsg
Still doing fine despite no internship,btohqsg
If got decent GPA and not some no name uni should be fine also,btohqsg
I feel now like getting tougher and tougher in terms of job market ngl,btohqsg
My time CS is like starting to get popular,btohqsg
Ben Leong also starting to get more traction,btohqsg
But not so popular until like everyone wants to do CS,btohqsg
True but I feel there are some industries ppl just dw one,btohqsg
If down turn just retreat back to those lor,btohqsg
Imo once it starts to get main stream it loses steam liao,btohqsg
Needs to be a niche degree so the supply is constraint at its infancy,btohqsg
Like NUS Confessions/NUSWhispers have been there for like 8 years liao,btohqsg
Its there when I'm like a Y2/Y3 student,btohqsg
But losing steam for CS at least the job vacancies drying up,btohqsg
Makes sense when u pump out thousands of CS grads all wanting high pay,btohqsg
i'll go be corporate slave then retire as some poly lecturer,btohqsg
I thought you mean the prof/NUSWhispers,btohqsg
But I feel that people will still do CS la ngl,btohqsg
Probably become some paper pusher and then retire as a tution teacher or smth,btohqsg
Si Yan for Prof.. Assoc Prof Si Yan sounds cool,btohqsg
U mean as a paper pusher? Doesn't rlly have to be. Can be private sector too as executive lor,btohqsg
But I feel government is more paper pusher than private,btohqsg
Yeah but those type usually ain't in high demand one.,btohqsg
Private most of them are thinking about making profits,btohqsg
Pays decently and keeps my lights on,btohqsg
Depends Singapore has many Government-Private Enterprise,btohqsg
An example is the commercial part of SMRT,btohqsg
for now i'll write papers. next time then push them,btohqsg
That... Probably makes me think twice about working at Fairprice in the future,btohqsg
I thought of working for them if I am back in SG,btohqsg
Nah I will probably reconsider that decision,btohqsg
Their culture quite toxic. But then again it's SG,btohqsg
Then probably even if I push my ideas to improve their operations,btohqsg
Its going to go through bureaucracy,btohqsg
