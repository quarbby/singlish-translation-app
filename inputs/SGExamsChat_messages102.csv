I'd guess Fireman with Risk pay (I don't think they take Rota commanders in SCDF NS)  if not then Commando Officer,btohqsg
few makes it to command sch,btohqsg
So they do send some in NS hmmmmm,btohqsg
few in mono intake makes it to command sch tbh,btohqsg
you have a higher chance if ure in tekong,btohqsg
Those that get posted overseas.I see corporal medics based in thailand earning $2k allowance a month,btohqsg
All cut now  since nothing overseas.If TH is 2k then other countries even higher hahaahhahahaha,btohqsg
being posted overseas sounds not bad,btohqsg
yes portugal only colonized certain cities/parts in those countries. for example  in india they colonized Goa even though the British had control over majority of the country.,btohqsg
i need to report to sch at 12.45 weEWOO,btohqsg
i was using my phine and it dropped on my mouth and my mouth swollened,btohqsg
wtf risk pay got another bunch of pay?,btohqsg
since only a small portion of the country was colonized by portugal  it wasn’t really considered a ‘full on’ colonization’ and may not be mentioned in some places.,btohqsg
policeman also put their life on line no risk pay meh,btohqsg
nani no wonder malaya macam portugese never touch,btohqsg
hey swollen lips = kylie jenner lips,btohqsg
dont need to use my lip plumpers,btohqsg
Base pay i think abt 800?,btohqsg
i feeling like they be underpaid,btohqsg
Its an allowance. Not a salary,btohqsg
no wonder gov pay quite stable,btohqsg
NSF take allowance. Regulars take pay,btohqsg
Wait are we talking about the money we gonna get in june,btohqsg
are y'all even eligible for the $600 in june,btohqsg
shush u have no right u have no say,btohqsg
Lol then pay you fkton to be an SCDF clerk meh,btohqsg
Maam my bank only got 47 dollars left,btohqsg

I have 2 weeks more to payday,btohqsg
I cant give you any more money,btohqsg
spent too much on food is it,btohqsg
How about you be my sugar mama,btohqsg
Dude grab food is killing my wallet,btohqsg
Because I'm too lazy to walk downstairs to buy food,btohqsg
i bought kfc and they had the AUDACITY to charge $5 for service fee,btohqsg
Hey at least getting paid right,btohqsg
once u post out as firefighter shld be around there?,btohqsg
wtf during my time my recr00t pay only $550,btohqsg
5km and above and service fee is like 10 bucks,btohqsg
That can feed me for a god damn day,btohqsg
Luckily army is throwing me back to stay in because my wallet can take it mo.more,btohqsg
u still get paid even during HBL anyway,btohqsg
Is KC2 or KC3 still the best food lmao,btohqsg
Oh shit soz I armeee n00b not chadchairforce,btohqsg
Kc2 food is cool too but less cool than aftc,btohqsg
sign on SCDF get that sweet risk pay,btohqsg
I have to go sembawang camp next anyway,btohqsg
RIP means downgrade in food quality,btohqsg
Thing about SCDF is real risk tho,btohqsg
Like the chemical explosionz IDK if they send NSFs,btohqsg
Ya but eventually you pass the course rite,btohqsg
Armee high risk stuff typically you know it's high risk,btohqsg
like the tuas stuff and all,btohqsg
just pray it's not during your shiftunless they call u back during your standby hours then u suay af,btohqsg
My section universally agrees that the food allergy food is not very good,btohqsg
I survived on 560 for a year,btohqsg
Pretty sure during high workload they call people even not on standby,btohqsg
well it's either you're on shift or on standby,btohqsg
I haven't heard of them calling back ppl who are on approved leave,btohqsg
o wao  must be cuz they can manage then,btohqsg
Anyway they do use a lot of automated stuf,btohqsg
Must be super big fire if they call ppl back,btohqsg
They just plomp down a few,btohqsg
Assuming no rescue I think manpower not extremely necessary,btohqsg
Dun see they happy happy suka suka play water only...,btohqsg
What's so nice about playing water,btohqsg
It's like the force of rhinos pushing you back,btohqsg
You can kinda-control it with the valve tho,btohqsg
But goddam it's stronk when the valve is full blast,btohqsg
But anyway a lot of water comes out and you get to control how/where it goes,btohqsg
but the big boi pumpers still do most of the work now luh,btohqsg
When it repeats it gets very boring but,btohqsg
Actl IDK if you going NS  but if your COMD/Manpower goes to a fire station for a visit (tag it under National Education)  they will let you use the hose.,btohqsg
And yes you need to do National Education in NS pepega,btohqsg
Fire station visit can organise yourself,btohqsg
Well the alternative is museum visit or some really lame shit typically so when it came up it was a good option,btohqsg
imagine getting posted to fire station to teach SAF bois how to not kill themselves while using a hose,btohqsg
During our visit they even they had some activation  so we saw them rolling out  real readiness right there,btohqsg
yea smth smth 1 min activation time,btohqsg
Anyway this kind of thing is a cohesion-ish activity  SAF side would be quite relaxed,btohqsg
Only sad duty bois can't go,btohqsg
yea y'all saf just come station see see look look,btohqsg
nice wad  actl SAF camps should host national education for SPF NSFs/s,btohqsg
I think they actl do but only for the already-public-outreach stuff hais,btohqsg
I still haven't gone onto the Vivo City navy ship before,btohqsg
Can't beat visiting a ship tbh,btohqsg
Ezier go Airshow even tho COVID hit this year Airshow hard,btohqsg
That reminds me of when they sent ad for that thing through mail,btohqsg
And they had a message attached written by a senior of yours from your school,btohqsg
Or am I thinking of another navy thing,btohqsg
I might have even gone for it,btohqsg
Are u ready to fight tiongs in csc,btohqsg
Omg the only time I've been on a ship is during my sister's navy open house thingy,btohqsg
Can you write code in chinese?,btohqsg
Govt wanted bilingualism and tech saviness,btohqsg
Did u just copy paste C++ to gtranslate,btohqsg
I think the result is practically that,btohqsg
too long nvr see chinese alr,btohqsg
How come u never see chinese for so long,btohqsg
Bro i grad sec sch 5yrs ago,btohqsg
i mean i use mandarin at home too la,btohqsg
but we seldom type in mandarin,btohqsg
I hate this but I love it,btohqsg
I wrote it in code blocks,btohqsg
better than periodic table in chinese still,btohqsg
Spend 👏 less 👏 time 👏 commenting 👏 spend 👏 more 👏 time 👏 failing 👏 students,btohqsg
Python can support variables in chinese,btohqsg
this gives off big ho ching energy,btohqsg
I will write illegible and unnecessarily long code that will burn processors anytime*** FTFY,btohqsg
Just wanna ask  but if one's degree cap in NUS is 4.1 upon graduation  you will be classified as second upper (Honours (distinction))?,btohqsg
You’ve planned ahead so far that you’ve predicted your future GPA,btohqsg
Hello anyone here looking for a portfolio layout ? Simple and modular,btohqsg

Tats what i did months ago  but still improving on it 🤔,btohqsg

Oh no dont doxx my ip@localhost,btohqsg
What if I can see your ip,btohqsg
Tbh what can you do with someone's IP address?,btohqsg
Are you ready for a visit?,btohqsg
That means we are technically not supposed to be popped,btohqsg
But we did kinda fulfill our 9 weeks already did we not,btohqsg
Welp either way the pop happened so 😏,btohqsg
U dont see ppl advertising 'enrichment lessons' here right?,btohqsg
Y does that keep showing up for everyone,btohqsg
Quizarium has been not here for years,btohqsg
That gathering is disgusting  even without Covid,btohqsg
help me post a petition link,btohqsg
Is this some kind of poly joke that I'm too elitist to understand,btohqsg
The petition didn’t talked about ITE,btohqsg
Maybe its a secret elite chat,btohqsg
Hi everyone!Have you ever felt really demoralized and unmotivated  and yet can’t explain why? Or  do you see any of your close friends being more pessimistic than usual  but you have no idea how to comfort them?Learn the vocabulary to unpack and communicate why it seems that clouds are always looming overhead.Coming this Saturday  we will be partnering with Acceset and Boys’ Town to hold a mental health event via Zoom!

u hv to be kidding me who so free create this petition,btohqsg
I shall now abandon this platform,btohqsg
i'll like to get a refund  please,btohqsg
First kueh then bedok and now john...,btohqsg
fun fact: bedok and john have won the giveaway,btohqsg
kueh have never won it once LMAO,btohqsg
is it a must to use real name,btohqsg
No one can tell it’s not your real name anyway,btohqsg
Hi sorry anyone can humour me with a question I have? Any possibility for an SIT graduate to make it to MOE to teach?,btohqsg
Garmen is good grades = go in,btohqsg
Anyway you'll need a PGDE to teach,btohqsg
So after SIT you'll need go NIE,btohqsg
Yeah as in get into NIE,btohqsg
I don't see why not as long as your grades make it,btohqsg
But just because you get pdge doesn't mean you'll get into MOE,btohqsg
then what do people do if they don't get into moe teaching then,btohqsg
i heard of first class honours who failed the interview stage,btohqsg
u can consider private tutoring as an alternative if u are rly keen in teaching,btohqsg
That's why ppl go for education scholarship,btohqsg
Cause that means accepted by moe alr,btohqsg
but ofc entering MOE solidifies ur stand in the education industry,btohqsg
Or it just allows you to say Ex MOE teacher,btohqsg
You can always become private tutor,btohqsg
ahhh right okay that makes sense,btohqsg
hmm okay alright thanks guys for humouring my question,btohqsg
Anyway education isn't really the best place to go,btohqsg
If u got no passion yea,btohqsg
My jc teacher told me that many students want to be teachers cause that's the only job they've seen,btohqsg
I do suppose there's a bit of truth in this,btohqsg
Dealing with primary school children sucks,btohqsg
And dealing with primary school children in the form of adults also suck,btohqsg
i was trying to think of a pun with your misspelling of principle but i just want sleep now,btohqsg
I mean for him to ascend into a concept,btohqsg
education is one of the best once u see the world,btohqsg
Actually  I rather be those people who collaborate to write textbooks compared to teaching lol,btohqsg
It’s not a very interesting job I would think,btohqsg
You’re just writing the same things everyone has been writing for the past 30 years,btohqsg
as compared to most research assistant/scientist jobs for science grads  being a teacher is actually relatively decent,btohqsg
But every student is learning something for the first time,btohqsg
And it’s cool when they get it,btohqsg
That's why MOE tries to attract people from private sector,btohqsg
But it's not enough to make a change,btohqsg
If you're doing well in private,btohqsg
Why do you want to jump over to public,btohqsg
unless u get those higher positions  then it superscales,btohqsg
i know the exact pay ranges,btohqsg
In the end MOE is only attracting those on the lower end,btohqsg
but i dont think is allowed to be said?,btohqsg
is actually quite good la tbh,btohqsg
usually ppl who jump to private are those who can exceed what MOE gives them on a monthly basis,btohqsg
and not all make it out there  about half fail,btohqsg
or they make less than the monthly salary,btohqsg
Yup  used to want to be a teacher but then I realise my best Teachers are those that have life experience outside the classroom. So relegated it to a retirement job instead lol.,btohqsg
ah thought so for the last statement,btohqsg
i wanted to find another career before going teaching eventually,btohqsg
but if i did that tbh  everythin will go back to point 1,btohqsg
U can be a teacher and also have a life outside skool,btohqsg
i think is possible to have life experience while having a career as a teacher,btohqsg
which i intend to do probs,btohqsg
U need to take a huge pay cut though,btohqsg
If u join moe from private,btohqsg
Eg my maths teacher is a national floorball player,btohqsg
yep  unless u retired from moe before,btohqsg
My other maths teacher is a diver,btohqsg
My other other maths teacher is an actor,btohqsg
They still do all those things,btohqsg
Many phy teachers were engineering grads anyway. Not surprised if their first career was engineer,btohqsg
logically speaking can a bus be 100m?,btohqsg
i was imaging how long usian bolt was running,btohqsg
100m seems pretty long for a bus,btohqsg
actl isnt the pay dependent on ur civil service position,btohqsg
like if u earning 5 digits in the army,btohqsg
they cannot downgrade ur pay etc,btohqsg
A bus is probably about 20 people standing shoulder to shoulder,btohqsg
Average is about 50cm for shoulder width?,btohqsg
no road will be able to accommodate for its turning radius without taking up an unreasonable amount of space,btohqsg
The bus can be like the double buses operated by SMRT,btohqsg
It’s cool  we can just set down some rails so that only the buses can use it,btohqsg
Then they can take their time to curve,btohqsg
Isn't a train just a 100 long bus,btohqsg
Does increase in income affect cross elasticity?,btohqsg
None of them have ever worked so far,btohqsg
and i rmb there were alot of people that sign,btohqsg
Even the 377a one worked coz lawyers actually went to fight the case,btohqsg
Get naz out of sg lmfao what about that,btohqsg
Uhhh got a few pertaining sch before also,btohqsg
There was one on spca ?¿ or some other animals related shit,btohqsg
Unless localised this will never work,btohqsg
Petitions by non-powerful people* don't work,btohqsg
Have you tried being more powerful?,btohqsg
is there a way to unsupport it,btohqsg
inb4 sgexams becoming a student union and getting shut down by the government for unlawful assembly,btohqsg
wait i mixed it up with the national service riots in the same year of 1954,btohqsg
Who back to school next week?,btohqsg
unpopular opinion  but they've already contributed to the economy by studying here. they chose to study here  and they're to a certain extent also competing with local students in school. the govt doesn't have any incentive to help them. if their own govt dw to help them  why shld we,btohqsg
I can't tell if Kueh raging,btohqsg
Why the caps on Dir Vecs,btohqsg
Why is this unpopular lol  this is popular,btohqsg
it's unpopular amongst the foreign students i guess,btohqsg
they come here by choice to get a better education  so idk why they expect the govt to help them,btohqsg
they're kind of in a tight spot tbh,btohqsg
cause they're overseas their own government wont help them,btohqsg
cause they're foreign the local government wont help them,btohqsg
Seems like education not very good if they can't think so far/s,btohqsg
(if you're a foreigner who migrated here and intend to get citizen status but have yet to get it  that's a diff story),btohqsg
Eh but it's always been like this for foreign students. If you go to US/UK/whatever top-Uni you will have to break through a lot of stuff,btohqsg
its a very shit position btw,btohqsg
But I think government should help them a little bit,btohqsg
"something something ""basically a citizen in every way except on paper""",btohqsg
I more surprised that apparently people commented in support of it on LinkedIn,btohqsg
How? It's going to be politically unpopular,btohqsg
Scholarships  we given them already but now is COVID  different crisis,btohqsg
I'd rather the govt spend $ on migrant workers than foreign students,btohqsg
If they are keen to be part of us  we should help them a little at least,btohqsg
Their political budget not as infinite as their financial budget,btohqsg
coming here for an education isn't wanting to be part of us imoagain  if they intend to get citizen status then it's a diff story,btohqsg
You need to be a tax-paying resident,btohqsg
Once you are a tax-payer WEW citizenship quite easy,btohqsg
Maybe reciprocity? See how Singaporeans are treated overseas. If given help also  then we should help them,btohqsg
BTW SG's non-0% income tax bracket is like 25k  and it's not always trivial for people to get >2k in pay so yeah,btohqsg
i doubt govts are helping singaporeans overseas tbh,btohqsg
literally no incentive for any govt to help a foreign student,btohqsg
lots of people my family know would beg to differ,btohqsg
Then the principle of reciprocity applies and we dont have to help them :D,btohqsg
Wait did they grow up here or elsewhere,btohqsg
I guess my social group only grew up here,btohqsg
"spouting shit like ""citizenship quotas"" to explain why they didnt get citizenship",btohqsg
even so  national interests is still more important than principle of reciprocity,btohqsg
and then the whole family doesnt get,btohqsg
eventually  they give up and run back to india,btohqsg
Liddat the children can get citizenship if they are a tax-resident  parents are judged separately,btohqsg
We're a very rich country and so we can afford to help them like how we help the migrant workers,btohqsg
I think it has been commented it's sometimes quite heartless but honestly I can see the National Policy idea on it,btohqsg
After all the ruling party is pro-foreigners  why not push it a little more?,btohqsg
Yeah actually I wonder if they should put more emphasis on whole family units being judged together  but feel like need a fking scholar to make the proposal,btohqsg
pro-foreigners who can contribute to the society in the long termalso political budget,btohqsg
The ethics behind a decision is always separate from political considerations I suppose 😁,btohqsg
Tbh i agree they need some help  but right now locals need the most help.,btohqsg
unfortunate but is the reality of things,btohqsg
But foreign workers/students to a certain degree shld also get some help :/,btohqsg
Many of them are very nice to Singaporeans,btohqsg
And contribute a lot to our economy and research output,btohqsg
Some people would say the Govt rank asForeign Talent > Locals > ElseBut I am not here to spice shit up,btohqsg
Well actl I mean  reading HWZ it's easy to see lots of people have the mindset,btohqsg
I won't agree with this haha,btohqsg
HWZ is full of sad lyfe people leh  idk why they keep complaining about shit,btohqsg
You don't agree with the ranking or you don't agree that there are some ppl who believe the ranking? Different thing btw,btohqsg
I don't agree that it should be the right ranking and don't believe that people actually buy that shit,btohqsg
Is it due to opposition party falsehoods?,btohqsg
O I can agree with it shouldn't be  but honestly you should open your world into what kind of ppl are out there cuz.....,btohqsg
Well i thought this was obvious HAHA,btohqsg
"im just like ""orh  they're retarded  too bad then""",btohqsg
Uhh  not really OP but OP supporters always stirring shit up,btohqsg
How can Earth be flat? The universe is likely to be flat  not Earth,btohqsg
people spend tens of thousands of dollars to prove their theory,btohqsg
and hold literal conventions for them to gather,btohqsg
welcome to the world  where people believe ridiculous shit,btohqsg
Haha can just make a foucault pendulum,btohqsg
yea they'll give u some bullshit reason as to why it's fake,btohqsg
