This is still not stopping us from using the card tho.... just that no rewardsüòÖ,btohqsg
Ya true thanks for sharing f,btohqsg
Those have master and visa might not have Amex,btohqsg
Somehow there are still people who thinks that Amex cards are only for people who have high incomes. I wonder where did they get the perspective from.,btohqsg
Amex charge card is for high income their CC is normal 30k,btohqsg
Didn't find charge cards attractive üòÅ,btohqsg
Previously the card traditional Amex cards don‚Äôt waive first year annual fees. Maybe that‚Äôs the reason? And also marketing,btohqsg
That means you not their target audience. Like some people don‚Äôt do miles  some people don‚Äôt do cashbacks,btohqsg
When i told people there are 30k cards they were shocked ü•≤,btohqsg
Means i can earn 1x reward if i use CRMC directly right? No 10x?,btohqsg
You can waive or choose to pay and get miles. The latter option more attractive provided the carrier don't devalue the miles value,btohqsg
Kris+ app only can be used at FairPrice customer service counter to redeem FairPrice voucher if you have enough Kris miles in Kris pay wallet.,btohqsg
get 10x if paid online via starhub app,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know leh. I thought it would be excluded as bills payment is an exclusion,btohqsg
How do we set up giro payments to pay for eg. UOB credit card bill to get the 1% ega cashback?,btohqsg

need print and mail interbank giro form,btohqsg
GPMC can't be added to Google pay wallet right?,btohqsg
No  tap and pay directly using Grab app,btohqsg
Just want to check  is this applicable to all other credit cards too?,btohqsg
Gpmc + uob amex 0.3% cb ok la. U buy cai png $10 get 3c back.,btohqsg
might as well use Amex Pay or XNAP,btohqsg
Amex cb is still 1.5% rightWith gpmc,btohqsg
Cai png store got Amex pay?,btohqsg
Unless the aunty only accepts PayNow QR then bopian just try to earn 0.3% lor,btohqsg
A lot of SGQR have XNAP and Amex Pay,btohqsg
I guess so. Will explore thanks,btohqsg
XNAP is this app that you can link with your Google/Apple Pay and pay using your cc,btohqsg
Can we earn miles when topping up cpf?,btohqsg
Damn good for residents. Hawkers need to make tasty budget meals in order to stay in business.https://youtu.be/k9z-s-89C0c,btohqsg
Use amex TCB get 1.5 using amex pay beat the crap of uob amex,btohqsg
All those kids meal portion.Fries & nuggets or tahu goreng inclusive.,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL  is payment thru apps like fairprice considered online and/or paywave? (Counter scans QR code from app)Checking if it falls under the higher CB tier,btohqsg
btw only some uen Paynow QR can use Grab to scan and pay,btohqsg
So technically can use 250 by paywave and 250 by in-app payment for grocery and $100 elsewhere to earch cashback?,btohqsg
Amex TCB 1.5% gone after April 4 right ?,btohqsg
