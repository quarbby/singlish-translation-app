‚Äúhi my child is looking for chem tuition  currently J1. do u have the recent chem paper with the answers‚Äù,btohqsg
zero why u type so long,btohqsg
"how old is your child? ""17""how old are you? ""18""",btohqsg
greetings from somewhere near changi airport,btohqsg
Got clt like clt also no diff,btohqsg
but if w CLT is way worse uh imo,btohqsg
If we didn't have covid this year,btohqsg
idk how people can finish paper,btohqsg
There's no way anyone can finish üòÇ,btohqsg
imo the qns for paper 3 is all req long ans but 2-3m only,btohqsg
bless the wanker who ate bats a year ago,btohqsg
sAME I skipped my 5m elucidation for q5 bc I only hv 15 mins left,btohqsg
Who did the CLT also üòÇ,btohqsg
i see all the organic in q4,btohqsg
and decided to go for it,btohqsg
My friend thought need do 4 and 5,btohqsg
sounds like something my class would do,btohqsg
I saw buffer and went: nope. I cnnt do buffer to save myself,btohqsg
I saw qn 1 abundance I skip lmao,btohqsg
idk leh i felt like that definition was one of the easier ones,btohqsg
Also did anyone else account for small dissociation of acid for HA,btohqsg
I think I forgot to account haha,btohqsg
But does it make big diff to ans,btohqsg
My pH is 6 . Soemthing,btohqsg
With accounting is 85.7 i think and without is 88.2,btohqsg
It's ok  we are in this tgt,btohqsg
I put HBr for HA lol,btohqsg
Time to destroy bell curve again tmr,btohqsg
Ya lah that's why i wrg,btohqsg
how did yall explain the bond energy diff?,btohqsg
Forced to conform  to 60 degree,btohqsg
She say the bond strain come from the bpbp repulsion,btohqsg
So how much out of 67,btohqsg
Kumar is a GOD  god of destructionHakai,btohqsg
Oh is it bc there was a qn in the prev a level paper and bc the qn stated ring strain so we can't use that for answer in my sch's marker's report... but for this qn they didn't mention anything so I only wrote ring strain HAHA,btohqsg
Hi anyone got clb lc answers?,btohqsg
Finally O levels is over lmao,btohqsg
How do u activate ns concession card ah,btohqsg
Time to sell Yooperlites as a part time job soon,btohqsg
Not sure about the Ns one  but for other concession cards  you can go to any ticketing office and do it. There's a minimum top up.Ticketing office is not the information counter near the faregates. They are only at certain MRT stations,btohqsg
NS cards has no concession neil,btohqsg
Well at least I wont be more depressed than I already am lmao,btohqsg
Could an r/sgexams mod make a clb lc a level thread,btohqsg
Honestly I was stuck at the 1st qn lmao,btohqsg
wooden splint (lighted/unlighted) is used for hydrogen and oxygen. Ammonia is tested using red litmus paper  since it is basic. Chlorine  an acidic gas  requires blue litmus paper.,btohqsg
what makes u so sure the last unidentified gas is cl2?,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt need gas syringe to tell all carbonate has reacted,btohqsg
u only need measure temp change when all carbonate reacts,btohqsg
but he has 3 wrong ans,btohqsg
what yall put for the surgical instruments one,btohqsg
I find phy easier lmao ü§£,btohqsg
wait isnt stainless steel for cutlery,btohqsg
But seems that many people think it‚Äôs B,btohqsg
For graphical method u need stopwatch,btohqsg
3 marks lost can A2 or B3 right,btohqsg
i rmb my p1 o lvl i lost 13 mark,btohqsg
There is an errata in MCQ today?,btohqsg
What's the point of the stopwatch,btohqsg
my prac and paper shit one,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why that first question have to cancel beaker and write cup,btohqsg
But no need stop watch what,btohqsg
Stop watch is to find how fast reaction fo,btohqsg
i havent check in detail yet as im having a graded presentation soon,btohqsg
and ya he got q3 wrong,btohqsg
How many CLT qn in paper 1?,btohqsg
Now each qn all damn high %,btohqsg
I tot more CLT the better?,btohqsg
Seems that ur student made some careless mistakes,btohqsg
One error means a higher percentage gone,btohqsg
Yeah 1 qn almost 1% of entire grade,btohqsg
u can tell me some examples,btohqsg
Than how many CLT for physics?,btohqsg
Like for Q10 he forgot to deduct the carbon and oxygen mass,btohqsg
Had to do emaths during the paper,btohqsg
that seemed to be the 3rd one,btohqsg
Oh then it must be just a spf thing,btohqsg
Bahaha they issued us free concession cards,btohqsg
i wont blame ppl for puttin A tho,btohqsg
I put D cos 78% nitrogen in the air,btohqsg
The Y2O3 qn i accidentally memorised the ans,btohqsg
i gave that qn to him several times,btohqsg
I did the exact same qn before and is D,btohqsg
I think at least 1/3 of us here have seen it at least once,btohqsg
is not wrong to assume 2,btohqsg
but what makes u so sure the last unidentified gas is chlorine,btohqsg
u need to perform another identification test,btohqsg
Bleach can mean more thn clorine,btohqsg
With that logic then how do you know Ammonia is the one turning red litmus blue,btohqsg
Shit I saw it says l,btohqsg
qn 26 shld be A also,btohqsg
Should‚Äôve seen the state symbol earlier,btohqsg
wa i see ur tutor teaches PANC,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs my sch lol,btohqsg
applies for all electrolytic cells. Reverse the order for electrochemical cells,btohqsg
A bit risky for the non cell,btohqsg
Seems that it‚Äôs group 1 metal so that‚Äôs why I think 1 and 4 cannot,btohqsg
But at the same time I thought cannot reduce by carbon,btohqsg
D has 4  it says XCl with no other possible chloride formula. So X got +1 only,btohqsg
Issok the ans will come out in 1 year,btohqsg
hmm after thinking about it  prob C,btohqsg
I finish like 15 minutes earlier,btohqsg
Hmm but if it‚Äôs +1 charge has to be group 1 which is more reactive than iron,btohqsg
Lol then I 2 wrong for the paper,btohqsg
its not even grp 1 lol,btohqsg
But didn‚Äôt it say XCl with no other chloride of X exist,btohqsg

the fact that its found as an element uncombined implies that it is very close to the bottom of the reactivity series,btohqsg
Oh nvm so I realise it could be Simple molecular structure,btohqsg
grp 1 metals are very reactive  so is impossible to find them uncombined in their elemental state in nature,btohqsg
just that is not very reactive,btohqsg
Eh then what kind of metal u think it is?,btohqsg
Hi can I check does anyone know where to donate used TYS?,btohqsg
Oh so it‚Äôs those sort of transition metal with so called no transition metal properties?,btohqsg
Like doesn‚Äôt have variable oxidation state or coloured compound,btohqsg
That qn answer is D right?,btohqsg
the unknown metal X is probably silver,btohqsg
based on the unknown molecular formula given,btohqsg
so that means to say  statement 1 should be correct too,btohqsg
Lol if like that I got 3 wrong,btohqsg
3 is considered very good alr,btohqsg
the avg student prob gets 6-7 wrong,btohqsg
But I guess I‚Äôll probably drop to A2,btohqsg
i disagree with their answer on that,btohqsg
its alr proven some tuition centres dont give 100% correct ans,btohqsg
wah the first qn i put d at first then change to c,btohqsg
and the rationale was explained why,btohqsg
if u all take a lvl chem next time  you all will know why,btohqsg
u all will hear the same thing from your teachers,btohqsg
for next 2 yrs in prac,btohqsg
How come tuition centre got the qn paper?,btohqsg
My classmate threw the qn paper in the dustbin on his way out üíÄ,btohqsg
If u think of it  like the written papers or and listening comprehension  I tot after the exam the invigilators will collect the papers and how to remb the papers?,btohqsg
Some teachers secretly scan and leak,btohqsg
My geog teacher said by right they‚Äôre not allowed to do that,btohqsg
So must be the invigilator or CPE leak,btohqsg
aiyo no need so scared one la,btohqsg
So far I haven‚Äôt found a leake copy of the pure physics paper,btohqsg
%A is ard 45-50% As for pure chem,btohqsg
I estimate I only got like 80% (or maybe 78% if they mark strict) overall tho,btohqsg
Ohh do you mind sending here,btohqsg
But I'll pm if u want,btohqsg
If I get A2 for both physics and chem I‚Äôll hate myself a lot,btohqsg
u can redeem urself at a levels,btohqsg
i got 13 o lvl chem mcq qns wrong,btohqsg
i redeemed myself at a lvl chem mcq paper,btohqsg
I would‚Äôve dropped to combined scuence and guarantee A1,btohqsg
Cos it‚Äôll be useless in L1R5,btohqsg
i screwed my humans so most prob cant get to jc,btohqsg
Yeah some people flunk their Os then A level get straight As,btohqsg
and just focused on pure geog,btohqsg
moderation aims to help as many ppl pass and attain as good a grade as possible  don't worry too much,btohqsg
Like I‚Äôm pretty sure of the 7 subjects (other than Chinese which I got C6) I‚Äôm going to get B3 and a mixture of A1 and A2  so my fifth subject other than language to use would be an A2 if i use either pure chem or physics  whereas if I combine pure chem or physics and can get A1 and use as my fifth subject my L1R5 would be one point lower,btohqsg
a bell curve is much worse than moderation,btohqsg
lmao first time seeing a Telegram scam,btohqsg
i got 1 from a russian 2 months ago,btohqsg
I‚Äôll probably say something as harsh to a scammer lol,btohqsg
But u would have to take another subject and gauruntee A2,btohqsg
I mean English I have to confirm use it for language  then for the remaining 6  what if I get all A2? Then if I were to drop to combined science and get A1  wouldnt I have a lower L1R5 lol  because my R5 total would be 9 instead of 10,btohqsg
Ye that's what I'm saying but then you would have to be confident that u would definitely get A2 for the subject you would swap for pure science,btohqsg
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty confident that would happen tho lol,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt possibly get all A1 for the 6 subjects remaining I take besides chinese and English,btohqsg
Same I'm confident about getting my expectations,btohqsg
That's not what he meant lol,btohqsg
To be fair  mine are ridiculously low,btohqsg
He's talking about the hypothetical subject he wanted to take instead of pure science,btohqsg
I think getting A2 for both Pure chem and physics is just as hard or if not harder than getting A1 for combined science  I heard there was a student in my sch F9 for prelims both pure sciences  then he last minute dropped to combined and got A1 for Os,btohqsg
So moe should have some policy where if one gets A2 for 2 pure sciences  they can allow them to combine it into one A1,btohqsg
Seems that it rly is A for Q3,btohqsg
So I guess he‚Äôs saying for red litmus gets bleached for chlorine and then blue for ammonia,btohqsg
Welp then I get 4 wrong if it‚Äôs A,btohqsg
2005 o level answer key say it‚Äôs A,btohqsg
U ask him give some examples,btohqsg
So if o level markers say red litmus is affected by both chlorine and ammonia  then I Guess answer rly has to be A,btohqsg
But tbh i think is B,btohqsg
So can u give me reasons to think why it‚Äôs B,btohqsg
But how u differentiate between the 2 gas?,btohqsg
If I get 4 wrong there‚Äôs a good chance I drop to A2,btohqsg
Bruh If you think 80% is A2  I'll probably get D7,btohqsg
80% is a little on the lenient side,btohqsg
I feel so comforted thank you,btohqsg
So let ur cher know this,btohqsg
Seriously 79% is very unlikely for A1,btohqsg
Or maybe if I'm optimistic C6,btohqsg
Err I guess one bleaches then one blue?  Just like how hydrogen and oxygen uses lighted splint but gets different outcomes,btohqsg
U can use unlighted for oxygenLighted for hydrogen,btohqsg
I dont blame ppl who get tricked by this,btohqsg
But ur tutor's understanding is incorrect,btohqsg
Well this year‚Äôs papers weren‚Äôt particularly hard and had a lot of qns removed  so if 78 accounts for the marks removed and everything then fair enough,btohqsg
Is unfair for cambridge to inflate it a lot also,btohqsg
Yeah I don‚Äôt think it can be lower than 78,btohqsg
International paper which is easier usually around 84,btohqsg
According to some people it‚Äôs A,btohqsg
I guess I‚Äôll still have to keep it open to both options,btohqsg
i feel like asking my cher lmao,btohqsg
Is just a1 and a2 that changes,btohqsg
B3 also sometimes but other grades more or less same as ur usual grading system,btohqsg
Oh no dont tell me A pls,btohqsg
Red litmus paper is sufficient for chlorine because it‚Äôs the only gas that bleaches,btohqsg
But is the qn asking for out of the 4 gases or in general?,btohqsg
Wooden splint for H2 and O2  red litmus paper for ammonia and chlorine,btohqsg
But i guess we have our own thoughts,btohqsg
If there are then blue litmus paper needed,btohqsg
I have a live presentation now,btohqsg
I interpreted it as in general. They said when testing,btohqsg
I mean if u follow textbook,btohqsg
I dont disagree that red litmus cant react with chlorine  but oh well,btohqsg
Usin blue is like an additional confirmation  since usually when we use litmus we see colour changes and then bleaching (if possible),btohqsg
Is 68 enough for B3 in pure chem?,btohqsg
When there are other acidic gases,btohqsg
What percentage is mcq for chem,btohqsg
Ya and watch as you get A1 on results day,btohqsg
I activated it and it doesn‚Äôt reduce any cost,btohqsg
Why take train when u can fly,btohqsg
anyone have the paper 3 for chem,btohqsg
Random question but does anyone know whether you need to sort coins into the different denominators for OCBC atm,btohqsg
they only allow random for 1st 100 coins,btohqsg
POSB and DBS dont need. Dont know why OCBC must do this,btohqsg
How heavy were the coins that you deposited,btohqsg
How many subjects do u hv in total?,btohqsg
he want get the extra mark,btohqsg
OI YOU DON'T QUESTION A GOD LA,btohqsg
Did u sort old coins from new too?,btohqsg
What the hell is gg on?!?,btohqsg
wanna speed run MCQ paper after tomorrow together,btohqsg
sorry mr kumar  do u wish to speed run papers with me,btohqsg
we can target 2paper in 1hour  and eveutally 3,btohqsg
Tml who has combined science paper,btohqsg
Can take A level bio as private candidate then enter medicine? Haha,btohqsg
U need H2 Chem and Bio/Phy for med,btohqsg
Not sure u can use results from diff years,btohqsg
Can use uni chem also mah?,btohqsg
I just need one Air Level Bio,btohqsg
Oh you didn‚Äôt take A level bio,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs so content heavy,btohqsg
anybody has advice for my real shitty promo results?SED/DC,btohqsg
Commit more time and focus to study. Sacrifice some distractions.,btohqsg
Hi is anyone giving away their H2 physics material after alevels ?,btohqsg
How about JC bio? Anyone giving away textbook?,btohqsg
Online have Bio Notes for free,btohqsg
Anyone took combined science last year?,btohqsg
Trade war csq today be like,btohqsg
next year CNY is12022021. Read backwards also same,btohqsg
Hi anyone take Principles of Account? Any comment on the subject?,btohqsg
tedious af  practice alot and u shld get decent grades,btohqsg
yea need a lot of practice,btohqsg
Base on the new syb it's gonna be like a English paper,btohqsg
shld i be glad that i took the old syllabus lmao üëÄ,btohqsg
hey  does anyone know of any good audio to transcript platform,btohqsg
Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrongWrong wrong wrong wrong wrongWrong wrong wrong wrong wrongWrong wrong wrong wrong,btohqsg
i read this as crap dab dab lmaoo,btohqsg
i have so many wrong alr,btohqsg
THE EACH A CUP AUNTIE CHEAT MY FEELING,btohqsg
I ORDERED ONE HOT MILK GREEN TEA,btohqsg
THEN WHEN I REACH BACK CLASS,btohqsg
I WANT SLAP HER I TELL U,btohqsg
Can explain why 10 is A and 13 is C?,btohqsg
Qn 10 my answer is D and 13 is A,btohqsg
Qn 10 is D or A?,btohqsg
So qn 10 is something like a trick qn?,btohqsg
Dk leh qn 10 a lot of my friends say it‚Äôs D,btohqsg
Hehe how did u come to this realization,btohqsg
I invest in myself.. is it a good idea??,btohqsg
I got 6 wrong only woohoo,btohqsg
But is this all confirmed correct?,btohqsg
Haha none of us noticed too rightüòÖ,btohqsg
For those who took combined sci just now did y‚Äôall inform ur cher that the date is wrong on the PMACS sheet?,btohqsg
Anyone got combined chem/bio ans ?,btohqsg
Real qn is why r u joining only aft olevels,btohqsg
Lol so many debate about physics question 13.,btohqsg
My teacher said that but my friend's teacher said A.,btohqsg
Last reflected ray is parallel to the first incident ray but travelled in the opposite direction,btohqsg
180 degrees bah.. if 2 mirrors are perpendicular to each other,btohqsg
time to do so for h2 chem!!!,btohqsg
if theres greater surface area the radiation emitted per 1m^2 will be evenly spread out,btohqsg
It does. Rough surfaces emit heat faster than smooth surfaces,btohqsg
for question 10 why is D wrong,btohqsg
Temperature difference. The greater the difference  the faster the rate of heat emitted,btohqsg
more radiant heat emitted to the surroundings lor,btohqsg
in case anyone still has doubts ^,btohqsg
Did y‚Äôall spot the mistake on the periodic table? Hehe,btohqsg
Can I check if this is 100 accurate?,btohqsg
Cuz alot of ppl still debating abt it (even my brother's teacher),btohqsg
Like can be 2 ans if read both ways,btohqsg
prob not but the tuition centre ans shld be more reliable then any ramdom ans so far,btohqsg
take the ans with a pinch of salt ig u can never be 100% sure,btohqsg
"They said ""nucleus of a body cell"" not total chromosome",btohqsg
bruh u dont ask me i put B   honestly i domt trust the centres ans 100% as well,btohqsg
Change in angle is 180 degrees after reflecting off 2 mirrors perpendicular to each other,btohqsg
alot of qns quite debatable also,btohqsg
Bedok  can explain why C? I don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
I know that‚Äôs not ur real name btw^,btohqsg
I take 180 minus 72 tho:(,btohqsg
Am I the only one who uses my real name,btohqsg
This world is full of deceivers,btohqsg
my chem quiz just now no full marks,btohqsg
Is it true that A1 for comb sci must be above 85?,btohqsg
I mean like 85 as a benchmark,btohqsg
the seat space is notoriously small,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that at ang mo Kio?,btohqsg
some idiot decided to name two different malls with the same name,btohqsg
at least tampines was smart  tampines mall  tampines one  century square,btohqsg
Haha farrer Park not in farrer Road,btohqsg
So if they name ‚ÄúTampines Mall‚Äù at Jurong  ppl will question,btohqsg
Pasir ris sec is in tampines,btohqsg
Pasir ris is in west coast. Jurong is in hougang,btohqsg
Dun anyhow ah i will confusedüòÇ,btohqsg
Girl is boy boy is gir,btohqsg
Dun mess up the world ah u,btohqsg
Just count if the formula neutralizes the charges can liao,btohqsg
The jae booklet is out in case anyone want to take a look,btohqsg
well i got the book at home ü§£,btohqsg
Do promo results mean anything if youre safe from demotion and they dont show percentiles,btohqsg
They really should show percentiles but one of my teacher said they removed it cause moe,btohqsg
U know they removed precentiles for our results on our portal too,btohqsg
But someone hacked into our portal and got a link to show the percentiles,btohqsg
Cos its promo result so it is decided by the sch,btohqsg
Then now u say safe from demotion,btohqsg
I mean like i dont really feel anything for tmr cause i dont actually know how well i did IN COMPARISON to my peers,btohqsg
I just want to know how well i actually did,btohqsg
Ok... just dun get zero.. shd be fine,btohqsg
Sorry i finally got ur question,btohqsg
Okay then approach teacher n ask?,btohqsg
Lol you waiting for a reply?,btohqsg
Cause like if i get 70 for smtg but i do not know how many people got above 70,btohqsg
Or just ask ard ur friends,btohqsg
But usually schools will show right?,btohqsg
I tot at the end of every exam they will show the stats,btohqsg
Apparently new moe statement told schools not to show,btohqsg
In every sch every level every exam,btohqsg
Only a lvls they show i think,btohqsg
