Well I would expect them to be the cream of the crop,btohqsg
cuz they keep saying they the best,btohqsg
english is just something we learn at a basic level and only bother with the rules and shit,btohqsg
but prose is left out of the syllabus,btohqsg
"idk some RI/HCI students i meet them and im like""So tell me what you have done successfully and impressively"" cuz idk man",btohqsg
we're taught how to make arguments but end up sounding rigid bc we dk how to convey them otherwise,btohqsg
PEEL is a general structure but it's not like a step by step process,btohqsg
teachers teach PEEL as if ur supposed to follow it methodologically,btohqsg
no because i think its a sample size problem but then i dont agree when ppl say all ri/hci jc students have the best grades,btohqsg
i write gp essays like how I text my friends,btohqsg
because i know ppl from those schs who barely promoted,btohqsg
you have the insanely high flyers and the people left behind,btohqsg
Its just extrapolated based on the fact that they have the highest median in Singapore so generally at least 50% of them do better than most of SG,btohqsg
people also will retain in those schs,btohqsg
oh today ur kouhais got scolded by teacher for inappropriate behaviours,btohqsg
ok there was this group of guys,btohqsg
they kept being disruptive in h2 hist lecture,btohqsg
why everyone looking for female tutors,btohqsg
then the teacher raised her voice multiple times,btohqsg
anyway when i tried talking to my mentee about GP i'm like always conflicted bc i perceive it a certain way but A levels mark it a diff way,btohqsg
so i end up just telling her to listen to her teacher,btohqsg
wat wld be considered crazy tho,btohqsg
i mean representing in olympiad nationally is pretty craxy,btohqsg
I had a friend who rejected Imperial and Cambridge,btohqsg
representing anything at a national level is a feat,btohqsg
cuz he had commitments in SG,btohqsg
i think those are like the extreme opposite of josh,btohqsg
that is not keeping the status quo,btohqsg
need to be more intune with local politics lol,btohqsg
okay idk man i feel like lawrence wong unironically has no plan for the future,btohqsg
hes just reacting in real time,btohqsg
i feel like his main idea is to maintain status quo,btohqsg
yes we maintain status quo when world dying,btohqsg
not to be a hater on pap but the logic isnt logicking,btohqsg
thats why PAP is still up there  *i think*,btohqsg
I think Singapore will be one of the last few countries to die,btohqsg
ur not wrong in a sense,btohqsg
i will retain faith in SG government when they finally stop eliding shit and actually tell people wtf is happening,btohqsg
i hope to die once i get my phd,btohqsg
we always make fun of tiananmen square in china,btohqsg
but never acknowledge Singapore's version of it,btohqsg
finish one goal and clock out of life,btohqsg
idt majority of the population thinks like josh,btohqsg
So backlash > doing the right thing,btohqsg
but ALOT of genz think like josh,btohqsg
josh was the 1 thinking more or less about money,btohqsg
I just think that they need to be honest abt their shit,btohqsg
if everyone was 10 times more direct and honest with each other the world will be a bette rplae,btohqsg
but if we want to unfuck ourselves,btohqsg
need to get fucked to be unfucked,btohqsg
