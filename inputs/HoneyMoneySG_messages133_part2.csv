Anyone participating in Tiger Brokers' 60 days 6.8% / annum promotion for new users?Any idea when will we get credited for the additional returns earn from 6.8%?So far I only see the returns made from  Philips MMF which is more like 2.8% / annum. It is far from 6.8%.Also it seems 6.8% rate is based on trading days (Monday to Friday) out of the 60 days. On weekends will not earn 6.8% am I correct?,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt know if I should apply DBS yuu.. I worried can‚Äôt meet the $600 monthly because most of the merchants there I didn‚Äôt spend except SingTel bills.,btohqsg
You have answered your own question.üòÜ,btohqsg
The card is not for you if you have to worry about this. Don‚Äôt get yourself trapped.,btohqsg
then don't apply.Unless u willing to change your spending habit. To shop at giant/ cold storage and foodpanda.,btohqsg
plus there is no guarantee that nerfing doesn't happen soon/in the future,btohqsg
Haha.. Okok. I hold off for now.,btohqsg
Hi all can i ask regarding the DBS yuu card..some say can use it to make payment for singtel bill?but in the exclusion say cannot..so was wondering can or cannot?,btohqsg
So technically if you on Singtel Kiosk you can count it as part of it..,btohqsg
Hi sorry for late reply. U need to download Liquid Pay app and login to withdraw the funds through a PayNow transaction to yourself or transfer to a supported e-wallet (Singtel Dash or GrabPay) that is owned by you,btohqsg
For everyone's information. I just double checked with Tiger Brokers online support. It seems tiger brokers effective rate is not 6.8% for 60 days but for 60 trading days. So weekends and public holidays do not get the boost  only get Philips MMF return which is currently about 2.8% / annum only.,btohqsg
42 trading days 6.8% (with boost)18 non trading days 2.8%Effective rate around 5.6% / annumBut it is still better than moomoo's 6.8%,btohqsg
4.8% is only if there are no returns earn on non trading days . You need to add the returns made from Philips MMF on weekends roughly 2.8% to calculate effective rate.,btohqsg
Do you have tag of 6mpd for hotel?,btohqsg
It's been a long time so I lost the confirmation page üòî,btohqsg

Has anyone received the rewards yet? When will we receive it ah?,btohqsg
They are very slow  last year I participated in their 5.8% NDP promotion  despite chasing repeatedly  their time frame to credit only around 35 days after your 30 days ends. Not 14 business days,btohqsg
Okok thanks so much. Did u withdraw and place the funds elsewhere?,btohqsg
Any guru know when GXS boost pocket promotion of 3.48% will be expiring?,btohqsg

May I ask which card give any benefits for insurance premium? Buying an income policy and first payment ($22k) can use credit card.,btohqsg
