He should hv accepted it and then i dun think ntu can turn back lol,btohqsg
But i would not expect such an established university to make a big mistake,btohqsg
funny thing is literally overheard our higherups talk about how they did not need extra people and have no idea who gave the greenlight to hire us interns..so end up we get hired literally become sitting ducks ðŸ¤¡To the point my colleague who is also a intern was given the task to remove squares on a map...ctrl+delete for 4 hrs straight,btohqsg
Wonder how u managed to hear itðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"not only  me all the interns+supervisors...then end up 1 month in  tell us can't do wfh cause ""they think interns got nothing to work from home for""",btohqsg
no shit..you dont give us anything..thats like pretty obvious lol,btohqsg
ok lah credit wheres credit due..its great for me mentally but def not in terms of experience,btohqsg
How is that a credit tho,btohqsg
its still a working experience in some sense,btohqsg

should I join more than 2 CCAs as a Year 1 poly student? I joined 2 event based CCAs  one of which I'm having second thoughts about nowbut mainly I want to enjoy my youth while I still can  but I'm worried about overwhelming myself because I'm an introvert with social anxiety and need time alone to recharge,btohqsg
and don't join for the sake of portfolio if you're not going to enjoy yourself,btohqsg
(unless u know and you're ok w grinding),btohqsg
dont tell me either one of those cca are clubs,btohqsg
(because honestly if u can work through the grind of creating a good portfolio  it'll be worth it),btohqsg
depends on what you want la in the end,btohqsg
I was thinking about joining a sports CCA but in TP most of them need tryouts,btohqsg
story of how im not in any sports in uni,btohqsg
im in my school's club for 2 years now  never attended a single event but still have the badge to say im part of the club,btohqsg
might as well 2 maincomm 2 subcomm,btohqsg
damn man TP cca fair ended today idk how to join,btohqsg
u get points doesn't necessarily mean u do anything,btohqsg
i wld much rather give a spot to someone w a 5 point subcomm rather than 2 3 point subcomm,btohqsg
well there's only so much you can look at with how oversubscribed reclists always are,btohqsg
u were given 3 instead of 5 for wtv reason lor,btohqsg
it's quite literally school policy to give council subcomm up to 5,btohqsg
but jcrc has liberty to give 3  1  or even 0,btohqsg
