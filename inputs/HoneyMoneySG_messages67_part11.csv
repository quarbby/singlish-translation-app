Dear HSBC EGA gurus Sorry this question has been asked many times but I still haven’t found a clear answer when I search the chat. 🥲Does eGIRO earn the 1% cashback or I must mail in physical GIRO form?Their TnCs say no self-initiated internet payment but that sounds like a one-time giro payment leh..Anybody recently setup eGIRO for credit cards/bills and received the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
OK  so amaze wallet is actually the best for FX fees now if I'm not interested in the miles game?,btohqsg
need dropdown  need to transfer from other bank,btohqsg

My uob evol card have clock 300 online. Any good idea how to clock the other $300? Sp power app does not allow me to pay in advance,btohqsg
Other $300 has to be applepay $300If all fails Topup $300 into your ntuc gift card at manual cashiers.,btohqsg
Moomoo 5.8% expiring soon  any other high interest alternative? Alr have tiger acct so not eligible for the newest promo,btohqsg
Pls check Evol credit card TnC what is in exclusion list.,btohqsg
do mobile contactless to maximise the cashback.SP is excluded anyway,btohqsg
May i ask. If i have less than 75k in my 360 ocbc account... I would earn 3.2%pa on my saving? Am i right?,btohqsg
Only if you have increased at least $500 average daily saving comparing to previous month n your company have credited at least $1800 salary into your account by end of the month with posting date falls in the current month.,btohqsg

Hello gurus! If i have an upcoming purchase of $2.6k of ntuc vouchers and I'm a miles chaser  which card should I use?,btohqsg
Thanks! Meaning ocbc has higher interest rate than maribank. I found my answer. Thank you. 😊,btohqsg
If you are looking for higher interest rate  can also explore CIMB 3.5%.,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to clarify if insurance/investment is counted for the uob one min spend recurring payment?,btohqsg
I remember the answer of this query is stated in the UOB One TnC.You may google “uob one bonus tnc” to have a look. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
If you talking about the 3x GIRO bill payment for uob one account bonus interest  need to submit interbank GIRO form and successful auto GIRO deduction. Must easier to just do salary crediting as discussed above.insurance charged to uob one/evol/lady/debit count to min spend for uob one account $500 card spend for bonus interest but dun count to card rebate. Investment not counted to card spend,btohqsg
It’s a bit of spillover. But uob visa signature for 4mpd on $2k. Balance $600 wasted but if u can  use uob ppv for the $600.Else uob lady family category to take all $2.6k but u might be wasting a precious category in my view.,btohqsg
Be careful. Make sure u observe which payment terminal they use. Make sure not a dedicated terminal for vouchers where possible. If can  pay at a normal grocery checkout although $2.6k likely a manager will serve u.,btohqsg
Oh if it's at the customer service counter  it will be different?,btohqsg
Heard of rumours / possibilities and I won’t risk it so I always Topup my ntuc gift card while paying for groceries at normal groceries checkout cashiers.,btohqsg
I think someone somewhere mentioned before he/she bought gift cards from customer service and it was excluded. (Unconfirmed rumours) but I play safe since no downside for me to believe.,btohqsg
Sorry so it means I can't pay at service counter. But cashier counter ok?,btohqsg
Don’t ask me. I m theonlyunlucky guy. 😤No matter which counters I went  be it service counters or cashier counters  all kena mcc 6540.,btohqsg
