I was referring to using ur cpf  e.g u got 150k  to pay off lump sum. The loan  is you take outside with bank somewhere,btohqsg
Btw  is it common to take 'cpf loan' this way? Does this scheme has a name or something,btohqsg
I would agree with your point on this,btohqsg
Then how to borrow from cpf board  as u said?,btohqsg

cannot imagine.putting money in bank is like an investment.. low risk  low return.unlike the money in cpf its more like buying a long savings plan that is mandatory to take up once you start contributing to society.,btohqsg
cpf to protect lower end of the spectrum. worse case scenario. like ppl getting scammed or making the wrong investment choice or career failures  heavy medical bills etc..it benefit ppl in that area with something to fall back on.to well to do and financially educated ppl of cos it wont make sense because they are able to do so much more with it.,btohqsg
CPF is different things to different people.To the rich people  cpf is very good  it is an investment tool. They can either take out the cpf to invest  or alternatively the cpf becomes a long term high yield bond investment portion of their portfolio. Since they comfortably exceed the minimum sum  at 55 they are delighted that they can draw out a hugh sum of money.To the poor people  cpf is very bad  it is a nightmare because it becomes almost like a tax. With hardly enough money even for day to day expenses  every cent counts and it is a nightmare that such a heavy cut is taken away from their salary. At 55 they also cannot take out the money that is supposed to be theirs (except 5k) which they desperately need for their survival. To these people cpf is not their money  it is like a tax.  The rich will never understand this and thats why we see so much controversy and disagreements over cpf.,btohqsg
Having said that  the policy is that poorer pple are less capable to take care of themselves financially BUT beg steal borrow buy  everyone needs to survive and besides food  shelter is essential and retirement income hence the CPF scheme,btohqsg
But of course the CPF is a constant steam of funds for Govt to use/invest,btohqsg
Should have made CPF simpler. Take everything at certain age. How u spend your money is up to individuals. We don't need govt to advise us how we should use or plan our money.,btohqsg
Later no money for old age becomes a social problem,btohqsg
Help one must help 1 000,btohqsg
They dun want papers to report we have social problems or let international circles look down on us right?,btohqsg
To say that people will anyhow spend their own money and create social problem is kind of nonsensical excuse  it seems their objective is to lock up people's money for their own use,btohqsg
Ok then there is ONLY one way to change it :)))) and yes many pple have spoken up,btohqsg
If you are in power  don't abuse it. Making new policies to beautify your portfolio is selfish. You should walk the ground  feel the lives of citizens and attend to their needs. Then you will earn our respect.,btohqsg
Then all companies must do this,btohqsg
Which yes they can if they want to  create a company provident fund etc...,btohqsg
It’s just like the 10% service charge right???,btohqsg
If I eat a 20 steak Vs a 80 steak at the same restaurant  why do I pay more? It’s just the convention,btohqsg
Ie if companies behave this way  hopefully we hve a choice to select other companies,btohqsg
This happens everywhere..... isn’t it? Some people just like to invent jobs,btohqsg
I dun have much more to say ..... CPF is here to stay.... no one is asking us,btohqsg
Either we deal with it or the door is there,btohqsg
There are people who dun need CPF  it’s true but many do need it though allOf us prefer not to have the system,btohqsg
But if dun have this system   we also can’t get our employers will pay us the 17% extra,btohqsg
I always believe that we shouldn't make things difficult for others  be it you're in power or not. You want to make new policy  can. But don't make life harder. This is especially so for our pioneer generation. With so much changes in CPF  I don't think many are enjoying their retirement years.,btohqsg
I think the Pioneer Gen not affected,btohqsg
Where else can you get guaranteed 4% interest rates these days? Dump in SA also good. Can get the money back if confirm emigrating permanently also.,btohqsg
Hahah see  this is very true,btohqsg
But pple will say it’s one way traffic  can go in but can’t get out,btohqsg
Ok lah for a forced scheme in SGD  it’s the best Liao,btohqsg
I rather believe it should be call Corrupted Party Fund as we don't know how much left behind and the actual figure invested and also don't know actual balance of the national reserved annually! Very sad sad sad!,btohqsg
I think that cpf is a good idea tbh... BUUUUTTTTTT......  I think setting a minimum sum is a killer for most ppl like what some ppl had said on this thread  if u r able to hit the minimum sum it’s all rainbows n sunshine but if u r not aniwae near it it’s the other end of the spectrum of doom n gloom,btohqsg
My parents are 1 very good example of this as my dad has been working for 40 years n still does to this day he has hit the minimum sum when he was 55 n now at 62 he’s able to take out a large portion comfortably to renovate the house n to tide us over this period as long as we spend prudently,btohqsg
My mum on the other hand has been a housewife since she was 33 n has not work since then so her cpf is stuck at that amt + yearly interest now she’s 58 but she’s not able to take out a single cent due to the minimum sum limit of coz not saying that she’s needs the $$$ but I think it would be good if she is able to take at least a small portion whenever she wants to ( not talking bout the 5k) instead of struggling to hit even the basic sum,btohqsg
My dad n I used to joke with her that since we r the only 1s currently working that when either of us are dead   she will be rich ahahaha but do we really want to come. To this point ?,btohqsg
Hello all! My company is distributing seafood and frozen food (e.g. smoked duck  scallops and prawns) via Shopee. It's at affordable prices and you can easily place an order viahttps://shopee.sg/m.bekIt would be great if you can like and follow the page  and support if you can/want to! 😊,btohqsg
The only way for get from ur cpf is to through the demise of a family member ? Sorry for sounding a bit morbid in the convo but that’s juz how I feel.......,btohqsg
Even when your family member die  u can’t use ur CPF account also,btohqsg
From what I read u have the option of nominations either through cpf or through cash so when u pass on all the proceeds from cpf will go to the nominated person,btohqsg
N it takes a bloody Long time to get the cpf $$$$,btohqsg
