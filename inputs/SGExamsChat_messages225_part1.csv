You nvr cross out ah ?,btohqsg
like they just gave a pic of people scavenging for food,btohqsg
then lorms is supp to be abt excessive food consumption,btohqsg
honestly other than them scavenging and picking food i rlly dk what else to write,btohqsg
would have described the people in the pic to get the other 2 points,btohqsg
Technically your TYS is no longer your saviour  your bible  your quran or whatever shit u believe in. I only say for math  every year they will always throw u question u think will nvr exist in the paper. But the question they asked will still be under the syllabus,btohqsg
