Will be tough n lengthy process,btohqsg
May I check how much is PPI cost at kaizen?,btohqsg
According to them  $80 for jap/korean cars,btohqsg
But mazda not much issue 1 la... just prep some cost for wear n tear,btohqsg
Hey all  asking the opinions here. Now that I compare ice and ev  seems the arf is greatly reduced with the initial ves rebates  hence resulting in lesser depreciation versus ice cars. Seems like a good deal isn't it? Maybe some ev owners could offer some advice on this. Contemplating the switch. Btw these are all 2021 cars,btohqsg
But when U sell no value to EV,btohqsg
Cos U alrdy 'taken' ur arf,btohqsg
Essentially EV - Less upfront. 10 yrs ltr nth gainedICE - Pay ARF  get it back at end of 10 yrs,btohqsg
Yea buy car always lose money for sure  just between lose more and lose less. Of course lose less better. In this comparison  just based on depreciation the ev seems a better deal lo...,btohqsg
The example 20k less upfront paymeng,btohqsg
U put it into an investment,btohqsg
10 yrs ltr assumption 5% per annum,btohqsg
So dp for next car lo,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why must always FULL LOAN!!!,btohqsg
Why waste money on downpayment when you can use it to invest,btohqsg
EV have to fight over charging points due to lack of infrastructure and parking lots as some EV owners will just park indiscriminately,btohqsg
Had been thinking about trying the Honda freed and Honda vezel,btohqsg
Both outgoing generations (RU and GB),btohqsg
Cuz my dad planning to buy one in coming months and ask me for which car good to use for PHV for long term,btohqsg
Quite difficult since both are different categories.,btohqsg
The sales agent told me some treat it as pay down 3 years deprec,btohqsg
That's why most ppl change car after 3yrs,btohqsg
If change within 3 yrs lugi the deprec paid,btohqsg
Full loan is a debt trap cos cannot get out of it unless you pay the diff if you decide to change car,btohqsg
Now still need to fight meh?,btohqsg
2025 just started  so fast say people stuck?,btohqsg
More fighting for charging ports expected since the infrastructure is lagging behind the EV take rate in Singapore.,btohqsg
So far all places I go quite empty,btohqsg
Do you mean in MSCP/Open HDB CP  or in general?,btohqsg
Just generally comparing the infrastructure vs the number of EVs on the road,btohqsg
Or just based on what U see online,btohqsg
Based on what I see online and on the road,btohqsg
Actually u can just open your SP Services app and check ev charging  u will realise a lot of charging points underutilised. I was surprised,btohqsg
If you're saying in some shopping mall carparks I get it (like Funan  Changi City Point) but in housing estate carparks these days  not as much cus unless EV PHV which Isometimessee them parked opp CDC where there are charging stations in certain building parking lots made available to public. Other times  they're empty.,btohqsg
This overstaying fee is a deterrent for people hogging the charge points. A very good example for those thinking of overnight charging ðŸ¤­https://mustsharenews.com/idle-fee-charging/,btohqsg
I agree that it is a good deterrent but I wonâ€™t want to be in that situation where I come home and start charging at 10pm and have to go down to unplug at 12am when charging is completed.,btohqsg
Sp chargers no idling from 10pm-9am,btohqsg
But hor imagine someone return hlme at 3am fr wtv reasons  then cannot charge,btohqsg
Idling is a good idea. So ppl must plan their time accordingly,btohqsg
Then reach home charge  before sleep come down move car,btohqsg
There are tons more charger in SG really.. Many operators to choose from that is why,btohqsg
This is bad for those who come home at 3am and cannot find chargers. The infrastructure has to increase fast enough to eliminate all these teething issues,btohqsg
Depends where you stay  my area the mscp charger always empty,btohqsg
Why risk it when sure fall asleep  why not go to hdb charging point? These are ways to mitigate risks.,btohqsg
Reach home. Charge 30mins. Enough to hit 90%. Watch a few YouTube vids n U r donr,btohqsg
If u do dc even better really 30 min,btohqsg
Not like U GG to drive till 0%,btohqsg
U just need engh juice travel e next day,btohqsg
Anything with 200km n abv is more than engh,btohqsg
Yah same and there are 12 chargers,btohqsg
