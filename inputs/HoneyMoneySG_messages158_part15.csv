Hi  for mortgage payment using cardup  if the actual monthly mortgage is $3000  is it possible to only set up to pay $2000 through cardup (ie partial payment through cardup)?,btohqsg
for prudential can use credit card pay directly via prudential ipay (or set up recurring payment via pru access) no need set up cardup,btohqsg
Does anyone know what‚Äôs the MCC for in-app purchases on Apple App Store/Google Play Store?,btohqsg
HeyMax and Dobin don‚Äôt seem to have App Store‚Äôs MCC and Google interprets it as ‚ÄúApple Store‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúApp store‚Äù,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check if we hold both DBS altitude visa and citi premiermiles which allows 2 visits each to priority pass lounges  does it mean we have up to 4 visits a year or do they overlap?,btohqsg
I was thinking if it only counts as 2 even if we have both cards because both are under priority pass,btohqsg
5816 for game apps in google play. could be other mcc if non-games.btw if you charge to phone bill it becomes telco mcc (obviously),btohqsg
They do  worst case no change,btohqsg
You have to create 2 diff accounts so u hv 4 visits,btohqsg
do you think CPF annual limit will increase next year ? based on next year 8k cap  only 6k of bonus will attract cpf which is quite damn little. last time based on 6k cap  up to 5month bonus got contribution. for next year will be less than 1 month üòÆ,btohqsg
You need to get 2 priority pass cards. One tagged to dbs  other tagged to citi. Both prioritypass cards will have different serial numbers. When using  rmb to tag the right prioritypass to the right credit card.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can help to confirm my understanding?How Kris+ reads transaction:1) Kris+ payment are all in-app I.e ApplePay Google Pay2) Kris+ payment are consider online transaction3) Kris+ payment retains the same  original MCC of the inherent merchant.Question:I can use Kris+ for Dinning (9mpd) and stack with my UOB lady (dinning 6mpd) category to earn 15mpd yaOr I can use Kris+ for retail  online spend with UOB visa signature up to $2kOr PPV up to $1 110. (Consider with Kris+) ?,btohqsg
1. Yes2. Yes3. Mostly yes but some cases mcc are different (like travel companies)Uob lady doesnt care payment method  only mcc so can use with kris+. Beware of mcc.Uob vs doesnt give bonus miles for online sgd transactions so no.Uob ppv only gives bonus miles to selected whitelist for online transactions. Check tnc.,btohqsg
uob lady is 4mpd+ 2 mpd only of keep 10k in lady account,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs intentional.It‚Äôs currently just left pocket right pocket now with no significant increase to employers.If they raise the CPF annual limit  employers will have to fork out significantly more for the employer contribution portion. Sure make noise.,btohqsg
Thanks ya both guys; yes I have activated the 2k mpd.Ok will take note for VS and PPV So generally dinning and hotel for UOB lady generally ok.Btw the travel MCC will change to other MCC ah? How was your experience,btohqsg
Recently got dp at Natas fair‚Ä¶Kris+ chan brother is 4722.No guarantees it won‚Äôt change again!! Always test if big amount.,btohqsg
Ya for mcc sensitive card  always test mcc,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys. Btw side question; like how do you find the chat so fast; I‚Äôm trying to learn this telegram.Like some question and answers I see before  but when I wanna search üëÄ long time  any tips to searching or archive better,btohqsg
I guess just be creative with ur search keywords. Usually short ones are better. Like i search ‚Äúkris mcc‚Äù,btohqsg
My search function is also bugged / not working well. I don‚Äôt know how to fix.,btohqsg
hey guys do you think i should let my child start investing?,btohqsg

Hi all  just to clear up some confusion regarding overseas spending fx conversion and markup  correct me if mistaken:If using chocolate finance debit card : fx conversion is ~3.25% charged by VISA + fx markup is ~0% charged by chocolateIf using citi rewards + amaze : fx conversion is ~3.25% charged by MASTERCARD + fx markup is ~0.3% charged by citibank - ~1% discount on fx conversion by amaze,btohqsg
Hi gurus (including@ChrisHMSG)  would like to check  for online payment in THB (> than SGD 1K) for Thailand hotel stay  which is the best lobang?1) Amaze wallet2) Amaze + CRMC (I'm am a miles chaser)3) Chocolate debit card (0 FX spread iirc?)4) Any others that I may missed out.,btohqsg
chocolate finance debit card using visa fx rate  markup about 0.3%-0.8%  no fx feesamaze+citi rewards  about 2.1% markup on top of mastercard fx rate (about 0.3% to 0.6%)  no further fees/discount,btohqsg
citi rewards exclude travel mcc e.g. hotel. For miles  consider using uob visa signature or uob lady/solitaire or dbs wwmc or chocolate debit card,btohqsg
Thanks  so you mean use uob lady / dbs wwmc directly and pay for the fx charged by cc and earn miles?,btohqsg
okthanks.  will do calculations based on $0.015 per mile to see if worth to pay the fx,btohqsg
note uob lady 4mpd capped for 1k spend  uob lady solitaire 2k.,btohqsg
should be $0.015 per mile not $0.15,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGboss your HSBC contact got tell u if the 8% cashback for HSBC live+ will be extended? Good to highlight in your msg too if it will be extended?,btohqsg
No news on that so far,btohqsg
Ok because if apply now. Then cannot hit min spend before 31 mar is gg,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
For Granny level  this should not be a problem,btohqsg
Can i sum it up as such?Chocolate finance debit card : visa fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + chocolate fx markup 0.3%-0.8% = 0.6%-1.4% total feesCiti rewards + amaze : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx markup 2.1% = 2.4%-2.7% total feesCiti rewards only : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx markup 3.1% = 3.4%-3.7% total fees,btohqsg
She got the whole village to support her spending,btohqsg
Chocolate card no markup. So it's 0%.Naked Citi card is 3.25% fcy fee on top of Mastercard rate.,btohqsg
Chocolate finance debit card : visa fx rate 0.3%-0.8% (no further fees)Citi rewards + amaze : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + amaze fx markup 2.1% = 2.4%-2.7% total feesCiti rewards only : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx fees 3.25% = 3.55%-3.85% total fees,btohqsg
Thank you  that is very helpful,btohqsg
Hello  after watching videos and checking with my expenses. I intend to sign up for UOB visa signature and UOB PPV for offline purchases. It would make sense to use UOB visa signature first then UOB PPV right?Any sign up/ referral link for win-win situation?,btohqsg
Always use UOB visa signature first until you hit 2k.,btohqsg
Thank you for assuring me. Very worried I get it wrong and waste more opportunities üôè,btohqsg
