Yoma surprised many yesterday. Noticed yesterday it’s bottom wick where the BBs threw down first  likely to trigger stop losses or lure shortlist in before the sudden rocket when went up more for than 40% gain within the day before closing lower.For now  Yoma have emerged as the new penny king 🤴. As long as the counter does not break down the current trend structure  our pennies does have chance to be in play. Good to gauge market sentiments always by watching the main leader/character of the momentHands ready on the trigger. Our pennies market should be coming back anytime now. Last time round  our penny market also awoken by Yoma big candle on the 29th May 24.Can watch our market more closely,btohqsg
🎉Pika World Breakfast Update 12 June 2024🎉Stocks rose ahead of a mega day for traders. We will receive both the CPI data and the FOMC rate decisions today. We have yet another record close for the S&P 500 as Apple shares jumped on optimism of an iPhone supercycle  given that only around 5% of the current users have iPhones capable of running AI functions. The upgrade cycle should propel Apple to a new growth engine.💰Inflation reading in focus.🔦With CPI running hot during the first quarter and showing signs of tapering last month  traders expect relatively flat and sticky inflation given the still resilient economy and conflicting labour data thus far. The main highlights will be Owner-Equivalent Rent (OER) and Auto Insurance figures  which have been the key drivers of the CPI data.Any softness in these two figures can help slow down inflation figures and give equity a further upside lift.⏳FOMC rate decision- A tricky balance for Uncle Powell💵This FOMC meeting is critically important for two reasons. First  we will have the Summary of Economic Projection (SEP). We might see an uptick in inflation forecast to factor in recent warm figures. The dot plot could also see a drop in rate cut expectation from three times to possibly two. It will be a bearish signal.Nevertheless  as recent economic data have shown signs of cooling  Uncle Powell may have a dovish bias in the press conference or a more centralist to keep all options open for the Fed. The risk of a rate hike has decreased  and there have been numerous undertones of the Fed being more skewed towards rate cuts  especially when major central banks globally are on the easing cycle.📪What's on the menu today?📠1) First of all is the CPI reading at 8.30 pm.2) FOMC rate decision at 2 am and press conference at 2.30 am.It is Wednesday  June 12  at 7:25 a.m. in Singapore and 7:25 p.m. in New York. We hope everyone has a smooth journey to work and a joyous holiday break for those studying.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
Honestly  our overall penny market still lagging now.Seems retailers hit by the recent flush. Flush does looks to be at tail end and recently seems plenty of consolidation and collection at the pivots.Yoma sudden BO should spur some others and BBs to kick start some of the sleepers.Let’s see. Good luck to us all🫡,btohqsg
