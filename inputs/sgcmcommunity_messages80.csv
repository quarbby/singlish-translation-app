I hope you guys had a good day today,btohqsg
Why does it sound like you're going to give us bad news,btohqsg
Giveaway planned for this Friday! Good news! - J,btohqsg
Does it always have to be like that,btohqsg
Is genuinely just hoping you guys had a wonderful day,btohqsg
i honestly js excited for sgcm car meet,btohqsg
I hope you had a nice day too sir,btohqsg
Oh  hope you had a great day too!!!,btohqsg
That’s the best way to end a day. Sleep early,btohqsg
Early to bed  early to rise  makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise,btohqsg
Could it be a passat wagon with a arteon front?,btohqsg
Apparently there's an actual Arteon shooting brake,btohqsg
And an Arteon R shooting brake as well,btohqsg
Are you awake early or did you join#TeamNoSleep?,btohqsg
Laughter is the best way to start the day!!!,btohqsg
Bro  did you hit your own funny bone?,btohqsg
It’s called a funny bone because the part where you hit it is called humerus,btohqsg
What did one wall say to the other?,btohqsg
I’ll meet you at the corner.,btohqsg
Cheat the system with these powerful Cat A COE cars! 😉Prior to 2013  Cat A COE did not have a power limit. These are the cars that make well over 130bhp and are still eligible for a Cat A COE.👉🏻 Comment and share with us if you know any cars that will fit into this cheat sheet as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
this is like a coe mini cooper s that i drove like 10 yeats ago,btohqsg
Oh nos  looks like J and R owes someone a nasi padang 🥺- E,btohqsg
Ngl  csi skills on point. HAHAHA- E,btohqsg
J only hor. I don’t make bets anyhow-R,btohqsg
I think people got this list a bit too early and now there's barely any good units of the cars on this list left,btohqsg
Twisted reveals 16 classic Defender 110s 😍Twisted Automotive has lifted the covers off 16 vehicles that have been barn stored since coming off the production line six years ago.My gosh  what absolute beauties - but only available for sale in the UK. 🥺👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you would love to own one of these classic Land Rovers!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
sadly there are only 3 of this generation without lifespan,btohqsg
So does this mean you could import it to SG?,btohqsg
I assumed it’s not rego-ed and therefore ‘new’,btohqsg
Depends if it registered as a land rover or a car under twisted automotive,btohqsg
would have to undergo homologation if its reg under twisted automotive,btohqsg
Well if it’s rolled off the factory and not registered  wouldn’t that mean it’s a new car? Just not sold. Like inventory at a dealer..,btohqsg
but you do realise they have plates right,btohqsg
Also  diesel ones might not be able to reg in SG since emission laws have changed,btohqsg
I didn’t stare at the photo long enough 🤣 was in a meeting haha,btohqsg
I would say that's a good thing,btohqsg
But you're not going to win the giveaway like this :(,btohqsg
Side profile looks like a mazda 6 wagon,btohqsg
The front end is damn good looking,btohqsg
I also want 1 packet thanks,btohqsg
Who's the first one to get it ah? - J,btohqsg
He gets the packet of nasi padang from me then! - J,btohqsg
We'll arrange@awj_mood. This month a little tough but I will definitely keep my promise! - J,btohqsg
Please leak the planned date  thanks,btohqsg
Can i get one if i can guess your name lol,btohqsg
This month’s tough but you’re tougher 🤭🤭,btohqsg
But its an open secret. Most people know already. - J,btohqsg
Oh damn im late to the party haha,btohqsg
Why u dont appear in the reviews anymore,btohqsg
Don't worry  you'll get your chance to win another nasi padang soon-ish (hopefully) - J,btohqsg
I just want the $20 hahahaha,btohqsg
You are currently within the top 10 most engaged members,btohqsg
If we get a new intern you can go CSI him/her - J 😏,btohqsg
Now you’re just exploiting the future interns,btohqsg
Can i be intern? I want a career change hahaha,btohqsg
It's really call shooting brake too? Mercedes never sue?😂,btohqsg
Well Mercedes wasn't the first to use the word shooting brake,btohqsg
I just saw a car with number plate,btohqsg
Sausage fingers means slower typing speed,btohqsg
They had a lot of Ford vehicles,btohqsg
Hearsay the Everests were supposed to be manual and someone messed up paperwork so they got all auto Everests,btohqsg
There's a few scdf ones that get put on sale after being decommissioned,btohqsg
Oh? But they hardly use for jungle ops,btohqsg
Auto is good  leave the manuals for the defenders,btohqsg
That one gets you a free bed and 3 meals a day in changi,btohqsg
And he doesn't stage 9 cars,btohqsg
You're not tuning and modding that hard are you Mr Shane?,btohqsg

What’s with the fitment on the rear,btohqsg
Because of workshop visits in your subie,btohqsg
We have very similar taste in cars haha,btohqsg
Friend has a tuned unit  600nm  so far no issue,btohqsg
Yeah but cant stay off vag cars forever,btohqsg
How does he not have shrapnels in his heart?,btohqsg
Either a Golf  A3  Arteon or….Passat,btohqsg
but the unit on sale now has an extremely stupid markup sure won’t get,btohqsg
brand new was 180k frm AD but the listing trying sell 2020 unit for 210,btohqsg
Well everyone is trying to make money in the bull market,btohqsg
So i wouldn't blame them. Try luck with lowballing haha,btohqsg
yeah   let the stupid fishes bite the bait la haha,btohqsg
Nope thats the code for the dsg  for the cupra ateca,btohqsg
I thought the fl was a clear winner,btohqsg
i very weird one  i hate how the tormentor looks hahahaha,btohqsg
Omg i thought we could be friends,btohqsg
So you’re a FL fan kind of person?,btohqsg
The short overhangs of the ateca gives it a rather weird proportion,btohqsg
the rear of ateca is like skoda,btohqsg
the whole car is basically a skoda,btohqsg
Doesnt matter what i like or u like. Ownself happy can already,btohqsg
ur anniversary today i don’t spoil ur mood ❤️,btohqsg
Not all FL are good man,btohqsg
I don’t like the A4 B9.5 😂 looks like a kid’s toy,btohqsg
Same like not all dsg is bad also,btohqsg
ateca can do sch run and leave roccos in the dusssst,btohqsg
agreed  but formentor looks very good to me,btohqsg
You look like the lady on tiktok that eats alot,btohqsg
even the sugar mommy scammer choose ateca sia LOL,btohqsg
actually for most cars  i prefer the pre facelift. But the formentor realy look better,btohqsg
U will be disappointed with the facelift then,btohqsg
Actually the formentor doesnt lose out much in terms of space. Boot still very usable,btohqsg
but the height of suv really works wonders haha,btohqsg
The VRS is a lot of fun.,btohqsg
i am talking abt the pre fl one,btohqsg
coe will drop i hope 🥲,btohqsg
cannot later need beg chat for people to buy my car,btohqsg
It’s like buying TSLA  never know when its going to go up or down  might as well just buy,btohqsg
later strangers will sweet talk me into not borrowing money,btohqsg
It is definitely more family friendly  but a crossover is good enough for me,btohqsg
today can fit road bike in,btohqsg
And i'd be dead before i get a sliding door mpv,btohqsg
apparently according to sgcm the new odyssey got 300hp,btohqsg
hahaha same 😛 estima also i like,btohqsg
Anyone want to buy my car? No dekit. Amount: 988kI didn’t take a full loan  but my dream was to always own an Aston Martin. So priced to allow me to buy new Aston Martin. Please I very despo,btohqsg
one careful owner always parked under shelter?,btohqsg
You know you reached funky uncle level when you buy an Alphard.,btohqsg
Haven tried a wagon yet. Not sure about the weight distribution,btohqsg
two. I was poor it’s pre-owned,btohqsg
Its ok i use foldies haha,btohqsg
I like when I see an Estima road bully,btohqsg
It could have 1000bhp and i still wouldn't get one haha,btohqsg
i’d think it’s cos of the petrol engine + battery,btohqsg
A car is either an EV or an ICE. I hate anything in between.,btohqsg
estima is such a warrior though,btohqsg
a family member has a 2011 model  zero issues,btohqsg
renewed for 50k only  the good old days,btohqsg
Crazy how this has more power than my car though,btohqsg
What is this? Boy we live in a new reality.,btohqsg
🙄 do u know how much road bikes cost?,btohqsg
Very. many people say it’s rare.,btohqsg
but not as handsome as ur car,btohqsg
Yes. I also know how much my wife’s bike cost LOL,btohqsg
But the weight transfer in corners  not confidence inspiring,btohqsg

i wonder if the guy was actually legit need help or trolling,btohqsg

i think he stopped cos we actually helped him,btohqsg
Mr se asked the same question,btohqsg

Next probably a koenig or pagani,btohqsg
Love for Pete is real eh,btohqsg
he don’t like kum gong people,btohqsg
He lives in our head rent free,btohqsg
Not sure if u seen the movie,btohqsg
That’s where it came from lol,btohqsg
maybe he soften and zao after the chevrolet thing,btohqsg
but maybe his data and wifi bill cannot pay,btohqsg
And in rare moments  void deck also,btohqsg
Not even enough for a blip on the aventador,btohqsg
vtec is the way the truth the light,btohqsg
Eh at least it's something! - J,btohqsg
did y’all transfer to an actual number or did he MIA,btohqsg
i think cat b will be 115,btohqsg
Lol if 60k i meet you at vertex euro tomorrow,btohqsg
Back then when coe was suspended  last coe price was 30k  i lowballed at 15k LOL,btohqsg
The interior is just sad  they really took Mr imran's style and stuck an ipad on,btohqsg
Yes bids probably jump by thousands now,btohqsg
MMI is now like a finger flicking art form for me,btohqsg
Prefer the older one with the 4 corner buttons,btohqsg

Mbux is the worst of them all though,btohqsg
they wish me happy cny with fancy graphics before,btohqsg
Looks good until u try to use it,btohqsg
I haven't gotten my hands on a Volvo infotainment system,btohqsg
On side note  the cupra infotainment is also not superb,btohqsg
The same as the new Audi MMI,btohqsg
huh have you seen the new andriod one,btohqsg
Looks like a some 10 year old found Star Trek and designed it...,btohqsg
A lot of menu diving iir,btohqsg
anything at this point is an upgrade from my subaru head unit now,btohqsg
not the best la but still very good imo,btohqsg
They've recently started doing the infotainment in-house and it seems to be backfiring,btohqsg
but i think everyone can agree carplay is a revolutionary life saver,btohqsg
LATEST COE RESULTS (September 2nd Bidding)What goes up  must come down. All categories down except CAT C!

my current one is damn good to me la haha,btohqsg
i’ll take wireless also la hahaha,btohqsg
I….don’t…but I’m a sour sally cause I don’t have a touchscreen and carplay with a knob is a knobhead,btohqsg
Which is also why some cars ditch their navigation systems,btohqsg
But must use to find out more,btohqsg
Haha why? Isn't it the same?,btohqsg
I have a touch wheel  but CarPLay has no cursor….,btohqsg
Carplay with touchscreen also not that fantastic. U cant press and change song / playlist etc on the screen when driving,btohqsg
Why use carplay when you can have all the routes in your head and just need Bluetooth for calling and music :),btohqsg
Native nav on Audi is good too if you update it,btohqsg
thats why... you have buttons on your steering wheel,btohqsg
I’m addicted to my native nav,btohqsg
i think the volvo one is the best for me  only complain is the aircon,btohqsg
should have been a knob instead of being on the touch screen,btohqsg
So you like holes and ditches.,btohqsg
regardless of holes and ditches subaru will find a way to go ws anyway,btohqsg
For next song prev songs its ok. For playlist if u wan change etc u cant use e buttons,btohqsg
Anyone thinks COE will drop even further for the next round of bidding? - J,btohqsg
u can change play list without touch screen?,btohqsg
orrrrr can use ur phone control the spotify,btohqsg
Yeah cause android based with eSim right,btohqsg
Well you can't exactly do that without carplay on the move either on native infotainment,btohqsg
my now one also update the moment u connect to a phone with wifi,btohqsg
Mine needs me to press 8 to 10 times to connect my phone with Bluetooth,btohqsg
Oh? I always assumed its identical,btohqsg
Yeah what exactly do you mean?,btohqsg
Similar functionality but layout is different,btohqsg
I haven't used android auto as extensively though,btohqsg
My vehicle doesn't have android auto,btohqsg
Like pressing up down enter cancel button,btohqsg
I've used carplay with others  seems pretty good,btohqsg
U cant toggle thru to the playlist  then choose the playlist via the buttons on steering wheel and then enter and play,btohqsg
You can do that if you have the Merc toggles as it has the blackberry scroll pads on the wheel,btohqsg
But that's just a way additional to touchscreen,btohqsg
Bmw has the scroll wheel and pad apart from touchscreen for the same,btohqsg
Yep.. so far only merz n bmw can. Other cars i seen/tried all cant. Have to do it on touchscreen and cant do on the go,btohqsg
He’s got a 370Z  M3 anddon’t know what else to buy,btohqsg
Sometimes the song sian alrdy need change playlist hahaha,btohqsg
Yes but for max 2 months before it takes another giant leap,btohqsg
Oh  that's based on interaction methods for the infotainment systems. But for other cars the screen is closer to the driver and/or angled to them so you can use that,btohqsg
Or just hey Siri on carplay,btohqsg
But touch is not that much harder either,btohqsg
give you an inch... you want a yard,btohqsg
If you do it a few times  become muscle memory already,btohqsg
Like my 9 taps go connect Bluetooth,btohqsg
Aim for the moon so atleast you’ll fall on the clouds,btohqsg
Not really for my potato car. Always a scretch to reach and press it,btohqsg
It's gonna stick around like this for a while :(,btohqsg
No need to skip or worry 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Ah i see. I haven't used apple for 10 years  no chance to try,btohqsg
But generally i feel android auto is not stable. But i use an aftermarket headunit,btohqsg
Yes this is the best  attention should be on the roads,btohqsg
yes voice control is the best,btohqsg
volvo voice control damn good imo,btohqsg
when you wanna call someone they can pick up the name of the person,btohqsg
Does it adapt to the singaporean slang,btohqsg
which is damn cool to me haha,btohqsg
thats why i think its damn good,btohqsg
Now my aftermarket headunit its worse,btohqsg
aiya you no need one la,btohqsg
Depends on the head unit and connection,btohqsg
Is there still.m135i offered? I thought all became 140i,btohqsg
u make an exhaust exit through the bonnet can liao,btohqsg
If the exhaust exit is in the front,btohqsg
Is it still called a backfire,btohqsg
No large grilles = no like,btohqsg
Why cars aren’t using ipads as HUD,btohqsg
Oh i didn't know the f40 came in m135i guise. I thought all renamed to m140i,btohqsg
How do yall remember so much about cars,btohqsg
they downgrade M on the newer 1s to a 2.0L,btohqsg
Why did they sort of downgrade the f40 version,btohqsg
actually the old 230 coupe is damn cool,btohqsg
On video is faster then a35,btohqsg
is there even a new one?,btohqsg
M135i becomes the midrange b48  supersede the 130i.Then m140i gets the b58 and becomes the m150i hahahaha,btohqsg
but they wld probably still use B48,btohqsg
Yupp great car but very overpriced in Singapore,btohqsg
when u watch too many stage 1 2 3 videos and then realise you are looking at the wrong engine,btohqsg
If only pml brought in the 128ti,btohqsg
when you thought your N20 had the same potential as you B48,btohqsg
I mean  a base 1er is already 200k,btohqsg
how much you intend to down LOL,btohqsg
in this current coe climate  i think 50% down is most suitable,btohqsg
Must be nice buying a brand new car fresh from the oven,btohqsg
even if dont buy new car,btohqsg
if not you need to worry about selling at settlement price,btohqsg
LOL i think sg cannot even full loan legally,btohqsg
20k and below can down 30 for new,btohqsg
I always thought it was 30,btohqsg
20k and above must down 40,btohqsg
It was 20 when my family bought a brand new wish,btohqsg
Min down 30 for below 20k omvMin down 40 for above 20k omv,btohqsg
Just that dealers will increase the price on paper to make your loan go through,btohqsg
Wait so all the full loan and low down is,btohqsg
But if you down too much also not good. COE drop your resale also drop like siao,btohqsg
then the downpayment u cant even get back,btohqsg
i think 50 most suitable la for my appetite,btohqsg
You rich  ez for you to say,btohqsg
maybe... YOU ARE RICH!! then okay lor 70,btohqsg
Good enough equity in the car and the total interest you pay not the highest,btohqsg
but u down 70 your upfront even higher,btohqsg
really depends on your financial situation ba,btohqsg
Cannot down so much also because your opportunity cost in that money high,btohqsg
this one i cannot advice haha  i belong to#FULLLOANSQUADRON,btohqsg
Unless you really can throw away the 70 with a minor dent only,btohqsg
Down more loan then can approve,btohqsg
That one again based on your financial situation,btohqsg
you intend to down 70 loan 7 years ah,btohqsg
Loan approvals subjective to each person,btohqsg
Take max loan for low interest rate. Put your extra cash into a investment that has high returns than your car loan,btohqsg
40 to 50% down  low interest loan and use investments to cover your interest payments,btohqsg
That is the most idealistic way of running things,btohqsg
I think fixed d rates are about 2.5% now,btohqsg
i went out in the sun for awhile   can feel sunburnt,btohqsg
Car loan now could get 1.88% if you are lucky,btohqsg
or 5% if u 10% down,btohqsg
So thats almost 0.5% nett gain,btohqsg
Please get yourself some sunscreen 👍🏼,btohqsg
Usually new cannot now. Used with good standing easier to get 1.88,btohqsg
For new  lowest I've seen being offered is 1.98 or 2.18,btohqsg
But not sire if rates changed,btohqsg
The issue now because of waiting times on new cars is that you will get a faster delivery if you sign up with the in-house financing at the AD,btohqsg
Like BMW financial services  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
Because obviously they have more to gain,btohqsg
Is there still waiting time? There should be plenty of stock now,btohqsg
Ready stock you must really compromise on paint  spec  etc.,btohqsg
Wah I would want to buy a brand new car just so I can pick and choose,btohqsg
For example for c&c if you go to buy an a class or CLA  they will push you to get into a glb180 or glb200 instead as they have ready stocks of those,btohqsg
Speccing the car is quite fun  until u see the option prices,btohqsg
A decent spec on a 992 c2s can buy you an fd2r just in option prices,btohqsg
One of the se offered my friend to trade in his for the exact same car,btohqsg
dude... i know of somebody who did that,btohqsg
full cash 800k for his 992,btohqsg
then recently full cash 930k for his portofino,btohqsg
he say i take loans  just not car loans,btohqsg
he daily drive a sharan... with EA888. time to stage 3++,btohqsg
Speaking of options  u could technically save some interest fees if u pick a low spec car with max loan  then use the extra cash to retrofit,btohqsg
Definitely save some  but idk how much haha,btohqsg
Depends on what the car is and the options though,btohqsg
or  just PI the car. AD tend to take in more premium when u option more,btohqsg
Car loans are so much cheaper leh lol,btohqsg
Can I choose the seat colors on a brand new kia sorento,btohqsg
And if the car is from a bigger brand  usually can get adopted for warranty,btohqsg
too lazy to settle the paperwork LOL,btohqsg
Ok leh  just need the contacts,btohqsg
yeah  but some cars cannot even self import,btohqsg
Sure there is a way to redirect,btohqsg
haha i was actually shading one very stupid company..uhm swedish,btohqsg
Use a neighbouring country et  etc,btohqsg
At times they'll bring in units with different colours and sell as special units but for c&c kia  cannot indent interior colour,btohqsg
thanks me too  looking at their cars right now ready to full loan,btohqsg
Unless you take no deals and wait long long,btohqsg
u hvnt heard of special spec cerato?,btohqsg
I like the pre fl look  but with the b58 engine,btohqsg
i know it does but it’s a hybrid 😬,btohqsg
Oh  next time we tell you the story,btohqsg
PI tried to import. Wearnes make noise. Volvo APAC stand by wearnes decision  cant even import one into singapore.,btohqsg
dont ask him this kind of question,btohqsg
don’t put me at a spot 🥲,btohqsg
But private/self import could be a different story,btohqsg
just know that an experience in the m140i made me love b58,btohqsg
very hard  vida is country specific. i cant tune a Singapore Registered Vida by wearnes in malaysia unless i swap the whole ECU,btohqsg
nobody has managed to do a full ecu tune,btohqsg
alot of things cannot be done one haha,btohqsg
like u cant reset the service warning etc etc,btohqsg
Eventually it can be done. Just enough enthusiasts who are also hackers,btohqsg
u buy and import from malaysia  wearnes cfm kp the malaysia dealer to volvo apac,btohqsg
Gtr used to be protected also,btohqsg
Ya i heard speed limiter got removed,btohqsg
managed to crack the 2017 cars and take away the speed limit,btohqsg
so how to break the 180 limiter,btohqsg
But i think more important is the boost mamagement,btohqsg
air fuel mixture everyth only 2017 car can,btohqsg
Could turn it into a different animal,btohqsg
czech boys managed to get it done,btohqsg
But it could also be for the worst  its probably very fragile,btohqsg
i have a friend running the same engine in the prev gen,btohqsg
super super torquey from the 2.0L turbo,btohqsg
the turbo and super charged car is low 400whp and 600nm iirc,btohqsg
Agree engine is solid but afraid the engine management may screw up if tuned,btohqsg
we shall see lor  so far still at early stages,btohqsg
It takes 2 sheets of tissues to know that you need 3But it also takes 3 sheets of tissues to know you needed 2,btohqsg
cos they have piston ring failure v easily,btohqsg
WHY EVERYONE KNOW BUT I DONT KNOW,btohqsg
I WANNA BE IN THE CIRCLE TOO,btohqsg
That reminds me of a toilet situation I had,btohqsg
Cant be  if 400whp then it would be at least 460bhp,btohqsg
That would be quite a monster,btohqsg
haha that car is v famous in sg and malaysia,btohqsg
Just saying options in sg might be more costly vs overseas cos of extra arf and the fact that now high end car arf is much more money.,btohqsg
No wonder lol. The level of miscomm is unreal,btohqsg
his is 2.0L turbo + super charged,btohqsg
HAHA its good  seen it irl many times,btohqsg
now he is working on cooling,btohqsg
