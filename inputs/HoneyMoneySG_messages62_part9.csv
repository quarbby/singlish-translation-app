If HSBC EGA has less than $5  would any fall below fees be charged and resulting to the account balance falling to negative? Does it automatically lead to an overdraft/loan?,btohqsg
I can't post message in that group  not even the arithmetic msg that the bot sent.,btohqsg
"It says ""Admin limits your ability to send message""",btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Ega fall below” to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
mine also. did you redeem the subscribed funds and cash out?,btohqsg
It takes a while for the cash bonus to appear in your cash account. After that can subscribe to the funds,btohqsg
huh I not going to subscribe anymore,btohqsg
Then you can withdraw after that,btohqsg
as HSBC EGA no longer have promo  do you guys withdraw all to $0 or still keep $2K for personal account?,btohqsg
I can withdraw even when the bonus has not come in right?,btohqsg
you not planning to use for giro?,btohqsg
I have another account under family name,btohqsg
any idea if can close online or by phone?,btohqsg
personal account I think got fall below fee. not sure can use online or not.,btohqsg
I do not withdraw as the rate 3.7% is still not bad,btohqsg
if I not wrong is $5  but if $0 how they deduct,btohqsg
You can't withdraw until bonus arrives. Few hours after i received that message then bonus arrived,btohqsg
yes  just monitor it. withdraw when it become lower,btohqsg
you better check. depends on bank. some bank auto close your account when zero for some time. some bank will still charge you.,btohqsg
for Citibank I think can just make the balance 0 and after some time auto close,btohqsg
my Citi and SCB still there after many years of $0,btohqsg
I think Citi can close online by send inbox msg,btohqsg
anyway that time I didn't know and ended up waiting very long at the branch,btohqsg
SCB email me to go to branch to close it  but lazy wasting time,btohqsg
I did close a few Citi account in the past using inbox msg  and left only one,btohqsg
