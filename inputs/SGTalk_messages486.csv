Something,btohqsg
first time I see a noodle place give you one piece of vegetable  like literally one piece lol,btohqsg
K dramas have similar plot lines among each other making it predictable or boring down the line and kinda unrealistic in real life situations I mean ya it can be nice but saying that it ‚Äúcan help people reconnect with their own emotions or process trauma giving the shows a healing power‚Äù is a lil excessive,btohqsg
To me I just feel it‚Äôs bias cause every country also got drama ! So specifically picking out kdrama is kinda ü§£,btohqsg
whether got healing power or what ever I leave it to the viewers ba,btohqsg
She‚Äôs American Born Korean so could be why also,btohqsg
but to be fair  kdramas is still the current trend I guess,btohqsg
Wonder who will take over next !,btohqsg
I rarely watch it and didn‚Äôt watch squid gamesüòÖ,btohqsg
I love Thai movies especially their horrors,btohqsg
china probably not so soon ba although they have quite some good shows nowadays  but some of their actors ideal of beauty is too cringed for my liking lol like the guys skinny till the wind blow will fly de lol,btohqsg
Thai actually all along is there one but just not main stream I guess,btohqsg
I like their comedies kind hahahaha,btohqsg
wonder if one day singapore will ever rise up ~~~,btohqsg
But we have too few people Liao I guess,btohqsg
I think possible but I think we won‚Äôt watch our own people‚Äôs movies unless it‚Äôs good,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the issue  honestly I dunno lei I tried watching but just feels so meh lol,btohqsg
And the competition is big but small market,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a big fan of some local shows like sunny side up,btohqsg
yea  I dunno but I just feel local show something is missing,btohqsg
good looking people? Good actors with good acting skills? Good story or plot ? I dunno  I just cannot resonate with singapore shows lol,btohqsg

I force myself do at least 20-30 mins a day,btohqsg
I do 10 minz nia .. or count to 60...,btohqsg
3 sets as per physio say de,btohqsg
Cause I realized if never stretch,btohqsg
Will slowly become stiff and harden de,btohqsg
Yes! Like after surgery.. those fractured arm or leg de.. need do physio too,btohqsg
The more flexible you are the easier to prevent injuries !,btohqsg
Cos 1st 3 mths is critical. If no do well  u cant even twist ur leg/arm,btohqsg
wa ‚Ä¶. That would be annoying üò¢,btohqsg
have to really push yourself to do it I guess,btohqsg
That time i fractured arm    twice a wk go physio zz,btohqsg
For my leg   physio ask me sit on the chair.. get up without using arm to push myself up.. use leg strength,btohqsg
Arm de i cant remIs like 20 yrs back ü§£,btohqsg
trying to strengthen the leg muscles I guess,btohqsg

Aiya  I think I hurt my leg again  which physio you go huh ?,btohqsg

Then I tell her you tell me which I should go la lol you doc not me what,btohqsg
I think she sent me to physio instead cause she paiseh dunno what to write to the specialist to refer also,btohqsg
Depends what ur issue. Last time i got tennis elbow  they refer me to ttsh sports injury dept,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs the problem  the doctor dunno how to see so she also of course dunno where to refer lo lol,btohqsg
I think mine probably should go hospital for scans and such ba,btohqsg
Cause if not it‚Äôs hard for them also,btohqsg
Unless they specialize in these injuries,btohqsg
Aiyo.. actually a few polyclinic doctors they dunno de.. my experience,btohqsg
I mean some doctors probably new ba so they still learning as well I guess,btohqsg
U should.. maybe u go A&E.Since polyclinic dunno where to refer u,btohqsg
Ur issue also quite long le,btohqsg
But ok la since it is slowly slowly recovering so I dun bother for now le I guess,btohqsg
At least mine now they direct me to proper dept,btohqsg

U can.. cos is scam u not us,btohqsg
now i am very scared of seeing this,btohqsg
I got some packages coming. Not sure is it real,btohqsg
See the number u knw liao,btohqsg
usually you will list down very clear your address,btohqsg
if they put like that  i will go investigate first,btohqsg
Download truecaller. The app will identify is it scammer,btohqsg
but then i only shop mostly at shopee and lazada,btohqsg
oh good idea...i also go download,btohqsg
the countdown to 2025 schedule is out,btohqsg
Recently I bought something at Lazada. They sent me a packet of tissue paper. Till now I still can't get back my $120.,btohqsg

Reminds me of angpao but inside is tissue,btohqsg
Already did twice. But they didn't do anything. I kind of gave up,btohqsg
ehhhh...i dunno liao...eh so far my bf bought fish tank stuff...nv hear him complain...shhhh,btohqsg
check reviews  check across other sellers etc...too cheap i will be suspicious...,btohqsg
Case will help u go after lazada üòÅ,btohqsg
if too cheap  complain will waste your time also,btohqsg
Is just an air pump. But big type. There was no review.,btohqsg
If not u go down to bencoolen and help lazada renovate their office lor,btohqsg
Like the foodpanda misleading ads.. case got informed wor cos ppl complained,btohqsg
you see how...if can just report online  why not try,btohqsg
$4.99 fee also got ppl complained liao,btohqsg
Ya I just started online shopping this year. The whole thing is still new to me,btohqsg
if it doesn't take up too much effort  just complain la,btohqsg
U ask lazada if they need free renovation or not,btohqsg
we all also started from newbies ah,btohqsg
You forgot. I don't have social media,btohqsg
This one also my friends forced me to use 2 years ago. Otherwise I would only have whatsapp,btohqsg
But after I got TG  keep have weird people message me on TG.,btohqsg
Last time citibank keep want me pay $190 annual fee ..siao! I wrote in their facebkThe manager call me,btohqsg
they are scared of social media,btohqsg
Ask me use my pts offset.. even dumber,btohqsg

what? crazy...usually i tell them if you don't cancel  then cancel my card...,btohqsg
Block user on top  report spam,btohqsg
I told my pal  they say has to keep contact Lazada everyday. I felt tired after hearing that,btohqsg
Many times these scammer msg me  i always realised like wks later cos too many groups liao ü§£,btohqsg
I oredi tell u go CASE enough liao. If case can report online,btohqsg
Ok will give it a try. Hope it works,btohqsg
If u think $120 is nth to u  then dont do anything lo. its ur money    i have no say,btohqsg
I rather donate to charity than scammer,btohqsg
A few times i saw scammer become deleted account then i realised oh they pm me üòÅ,btohqsg
