had this happen to me multiple times. certain words are censored and if your post contains a banned word it just auto deletes your post,btohqsg
Hmm... my this message also disappeared lol,btohqsg
Yeah we have certain words that are banned,btohqsg
s q u a s h b a l l s,btohqsg
LMAO solli... :D Now I get it! ^_^,btohqsg
i think the vast majority of the time  the word is used innocently,btohqsg
Anyway  my pp expired (looks around dubiously) and I live in Upp Bukit Timah near to Beauty World. If anyone passes by a sports shop and could help me buy them  I'll pay you back.,btohqsg
You might be on to something. We'll tweak it when we reach the office,btohqsg
But I don't shake my car when I went JB,btohqsg
There is a profanity filter enable  any message with keywords will be automatically deleted by the channel. Not admin's fault on deleting.(Although they set the rules so u still can blame them Lol),btohqsg
Coz those SquashBs only last 2 years,btohqsg
there ya go... can always find ways around those filter words like B-lls,btohqsg
lol i found another banned word that has innocent use,btohqsg
though most of the time  its not innocently used,btohqsg
trump once said  grab em by the ______,btohqsg
Haha short form for circuit breaker cannot LMAO,btohqsg
I think that one can remain on the filter list lah,btohqsg
i think the profanity filter could really use a little tweaking,btohqsg
Grab em by the meow meow,btohqsg
We try our best to keep things clean here ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
gg you gonna see people spam bad words all day trying to test the filter,btohqsg
Check this triple white beetle cabrio. (White body  white interior  white top).This is super white. ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
super white needs to be censored lol,btohqsg
The classic beetle are lovely cars for those who cannot afford Porsche 356 or 911  which the porsche tax will make you poor-schey.Recently there is a listing at SGCarmart for Beetle Carbio at 150K (black plate). Like wow....,btohqsg
i think with the beetle you do get a lot of cool factor but 911s have quite a striking driving experience and the tech in the moderns ones are super impressive,btohqsg
having said that  they are very different in price tier of course,btohqsg
We have unfiltered this word  but please refrain from abusive use of the word!ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
i like balls. they are round and bouncy,btohqsg

But if you yourself cycling  would you?,btohqsg
I am talking about Cyclist who want to ride across no issue but ride like they cfm win case if kena bang. So Yea. For me i will slow down wait for car to stop then cross. Not just dash across like the junction is his law ?,btohqsg
No lahâ€¦ no cyclist will push,btohqsg

The cyber truck is so phallic! ðŸ˜‚ Waiting if the hammer comes out!,btohqsg
Is this what we see everyday in singapore roadsâ€¦,btohqsg
yes every day see road hogger  the more u want them to move  the slower they get  some time i drive at middle lane see exciting show,btohqsg
I met a lot of such drivers on weekday rush hours. Not a good experience as they tend to bully slow cars like mine. I wasn't intentionally going turtle  I just give a longer distance with the car in front cos my brakes aren't as efficient as their big disc brakes with ABS.Sunday drive tends to me much better.,btohqsg
u are the smart type  i see lot of bread and butter car  tail gate those car with big brakes and tyre haha,btohqsg
