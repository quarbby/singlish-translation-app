Those who bought very Low will say can ... Eg below $0.30... they have nothing to lose . They will keep their buy calls . Every day same vision . But I doubt they will buy at current price .,btohqsg

Hmm.. Can't advise u but maybe u can read through the company profile and financial report over the years before making your decision.. I am still quite bullish..,btohqsg
Also with MT - I feel there is more incentive for some to spread false news first (vaccine  no reqt of PPE etc.)  so that more can sell and then ultimately will have the good news of bumper results after Q3.  Think of management - they have already said H2 is better than H1.  Without waiting for Q3 to end - how can they give guidance.   So patience is a virtue... DYOD,btohqsg
Just need a profit guidance MT will go up,btohqsg
Actually I think more people stuck with avarga than aspen,btohqsg
