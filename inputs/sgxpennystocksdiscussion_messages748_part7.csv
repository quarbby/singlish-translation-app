🎉Pika World Daily Review – 30 December 2022🎉🎢Equity market rose with job data📊Finally  a relief rally happened as more Americans filed for unemployment. The Initial Jobless Claims also rose to 225K  which is in line with most estimates or slightly higher. The weaker job report is good news for the Fed as it tries very hard to tame inflation. Essentially  weaker labour markets translate to lesser demand for goods.Nonetheless  gains are capped as investors further digest that the numbers are still healthy as they are very close to the pre-pandemic levels  reflecting a strong underlying strength that has not broken despite massive news.📮What’s on the menu today?📖There isn’t any significant economic data today  and we hope for a blissful end to the year of trading.It is 30 Dec  Friday  9 am in Singapore and 8 am in New York.Pika World wishes everyone a Moonatic week ahead!🗽🎲,btohqsg
