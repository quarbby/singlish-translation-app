🎉Pika World Daily Review – 29 November 2022🎉💣Cracks in the market🧸Equity markets were broader lower on Monday as investors returned from the long holidays only to grapple with protests in China as the zero-covid policy continued to hammer risk-on sentiments.Likewise  we are seeing comments on Fed research speakers. Pika World expects the Fed to return to a tone-down rate hike of 50 basis points but will remain hawkish given that it was only a one-month softer inflation data.As the Fed requires more data to assess its forecasts  economic data will need to portray more evidence that the inflation threat is easing before any possible pivot in tone or narrative. The market is likely also to breathe in from the impacts of a recent rate hike  and this will likely hit on another correction if the earnings start to show a materially lower forecast.📱Apple: Feeling the pain of production disruption🔫As protests hit on its production capacity  Apple is seeing a possible 5% reduction in production this quarter. It is estimated to reach a potential of 10%  depending on how the situation unfolds.Indeed  news has reported that workers are protesting due to their overdue salaries and the stringent Covid-19 restrictions. There are reports that Foxconn offered a bonus of up to 9600 yuan for 60 days starting in December to entice former workers to return to work. A higher bonus could be available for those who can stay longer too.It is an exciting story as investors could explore possible entry points if the stock corrects further for long-term accumulation  bearing in mind a possible impending recession.📮What's on the menu today?📖We will receive the CB Consumer Confidence reading  expected to moderate slightly to 100.0 from 102.5 in the prior period at 11 pm.It is 29 November  Tuesday  at 8.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. We had a rough start for the week with the weakening of our Russell position  but hopeful for better days. Pika World wishes you a splendid trading week ahead!,btohqsg
Yes Newcastle Coal 380USD/T +8.76%moved towards the $400 per tonne mark  more than 150% above last year's level again  on prospects of continued robust demand and tight supplies. And above-average demand from Europe on fears of a shortage of natural gas for power generation coupled with skyrocketing imports of thermal coal from India  as electricity demand increased because of a heatwave and a pickup in economic activity  have been pushing prices higher. On top of that  a seasonal upturn in coal-fired generation during the winter reinforced this view of solid global demand.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 30 November 2022🎉🎯Equity market is in LaLa land📊Stocks generally fell on Tuesday as traders took a break and consolidated past gains. This is  even so  when we see weaker economic data from Europe with the hope that the Fed will be gentle on future rate hikes.In perspective  Germany's CPI hits 10% yearly but is still lower than the 10.4% expectation. The same applies to Spain  which saw CPI rising 6.8%  far lower than the 7.4% expectation.Pika World will still be eyeing the job data on Friday  where it could be a market mover as the last straw lies on whether the hot labour market is starting to cool. A less robust labour market data coupled with the recent softening of CPI will be the right recipe for better equity performance.🧸The bond market is screaming recession🔫As investors look into the US Treasury yield for insights on recession  the inverted yield curve is getting steeper and is hinting that recession is indeed on the way. Recall that yields on shorter-term bonds tend to be lower than on long-term bonds. As a result  investors will demand higher interest rates for long-term bonds to consider the risk of holding the debt over an extended period.🍄Historical perspective towards the bond market and economy🧮On Tuesday  we saw the 2-year Treasury yield hovering around 4.46% compared to the 10-year  which was about 3.7%  a 0.76% gap. The gap was about 0.778% on Friday  the largest one since 1981. It was a time when the interest rate was in double digits as the Fed aggressively fought the stagflation seen in the 1970s  ushering the roar of a recession.Indeed  Pika World is seeing the yield curve solidifying the market's consensus that the economy is now in trouble water and the Fed could ignite a time bomb.📮What's on the menu today?🔭There's plenty on the plate today.At 9.15 pm  we will have the ADP Nonfarm employment data  which we expect to moderate from 239K to 200K. This will be one right direction for the market.Next  9.30 pm brings us to the GDP figure  which is expected to remain firm at 2.7% based on the QoQ comparison for the 3rd quarter.The JOLTs Job Opening data is set to release at 11 pm. We are looking at a fall from 10.7M to 10.3M.Finally  the most crucial highlight will be Uncle Powell speaking at 2.30 am  which will stir the market once again as markets seek more clarity and insight into his perspective of recent economic data and hints on the interest rate hike trajectory.It is 30 November  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It has been a challenging trading week  and we finally arrived at the month's final trading day. Pika World wishes all friends a delightful day ahead.,btohqsg
