Anyway technically I free for 2 months ah  2 months AL,btohqsg
So if anything happens you pandai pandai,btohqsg
Quattro baby done alr bo ? 🤣,btohqsg
Hope not la  my own car still okay  but whack some expensive car I gg,btohqsg

Do for 3 days ah.. Wah so fierce sia,btohqsg
My old car 116d go there xia suay,btohqsg
My A4 go also xia suay,btohqsg
That’s why wan go ulu track,btohqsg
It doesn’t matter what car bro,btohqsg
But Hor  MY kena snap or TP can pay kopi?,btohqsg
Just come back sg change carplate,btohqsg
U take photo with them lo,btohqsg
Usually the group that organise chsrge you one shot,btohqsg
Just rmb if you crash  cannot claim,btohqsg
So careful on your first time,btohqsg
You may be able to drive fast in a straight line,btohqsg
Cus they charging u with insurance right,btohqsg
But turns on a track is a different ball game,btohqsg
Policy got say coverage not for track use mah,btohqsg
How much control U can do while gng fast is another qn altogether,btohqsg
Talking about policy  gotta check what’s my Malaysia coverage,btohqsg
Depends on car and driver balls of steel also,btohqsg
I got see people track honda stream,btohqsg
Aiya all wanna haolian but there is a reason why not every1 can be f1 driver de,btohqsg
You go slow also very fun don’t worry,btohqsg
Maybe SGCM need do track day,btohqsg
You don't need but your road insurance doesn't cover you so upto you,btohqsg
Yupp you can't just enter pay 1 ticket go,btohqsg
Must look out of track days,btohqsg
But the past year almost every other week have different ones,btohqsg
Please join one that matches your skill level or they will kick you out,btohqsg
No shame in joining a beginner one,btohqsg
Simi skill level  that one is base on car speed?,btohqsg
I think need to join expert level wkwkwk,btohqsg
Jkjk but see how first since need group organise,btohqsg
I thought can just go in and whack,btohqsg
Nope  you got 720s also can be useless with track driving,btohqsg
So it's based on your driving skill,btohqsg
And if you've never been on track,btohqsg
No shame in starting at the basic level,btohqsg
Remember  anyone can drive fast in a straight line,btohqsg
Ppl call me goddess of Sepang,btohqsg
Delete and join using 2 new accounts,btohqsg
Try joining a pre organized one instead of organizing yourself. If you try booking yourself quite ex and a lot of permits and things to take care of. Quite mafan. Plus no slots available until q3  maybe even q4 for the year because so many track days booked already,btohqsg
@adminI don't know what to say  I guess you can just take note,btohqsg
if only there's a way to hardware ban,btohqsg
Honestly right i think the mute button works better,btohqsg

For ppl who scold mother father,btohqsg
well let the man child have his moment,btohqsg
Honestly public tpt fare gna increase soon,btohqsg
Too free  nothing to do hahaha,btohqsg
Now all trying to pad it and make it look nice,btohqsg
Ehh I’m covered till Thailand ah?,btohqsg
The 80km Thailand border is so that you don't have to rely on the insurance you buy at the border,btohqsg
In case you breakdown close to the border,btohqsg
Or is there another part of Malaysia LOL,btohqsg
But you can't drive there unless you ship over,btohqsg
That's why not covered in most policies,btohqsg
unless your car is a boat,btohqsg
I did not know it existed,btohqsg
Ok la after MY  maybe can consider driving to Bangkok,btohqsg
Oh wait nevermind still gotta buy insurance if go bkk,btohqsg
But Bkk still possible mah  a lot of people do it,btohqsg
Plus that one should be able to cover within 1-2 weeks mah,btohqsg
What in the lj is that reason,btohqsg
Finding new reasons to earn kopi monry,btohqsg
What happen next? Just drive off?,btohqsg
If they cuff you how or put drugs in your car and accuse you,btohqsg
Like got heard of all this story but not sure how true is that la,btohqsg
Waa 300rm might as well give 150rm kopi money,btohqsg
Even if you're covered for 80km  Thai border won't allow you to pass before you have Thai insurance,btohqsg
Hmm that one another time liao bah,btohqsg
150 is on the high side,btohqsg
Anyway kopi money market price now again? The police will ask more upfront or hint hint you,btohqsg
And must wait for them to offer,btohqsg
Because got some honest ones also,btohqsg
100 more for very high speed kind,btohqsg
Means actual break law also can kopi?,btohqsg
But at times cam picture will not receive anything because plate never identified,btohqsg
Fixed cams all on Waze and got a pattern,btohqsg
Ah MY also got mobile / sniper ah?,btohqsg
I thought not so high tech yet,btohqsg
Sir sniper was invited since the 90’s,btohqsg
But okay la at least MY speed limit 110,btohqsg
Have... the summon report also can give you picture. Very good photo shoot,btohqsg
Crystal clear one somemore.. See see can frame,btohqsg
But I also heard of picture right  at checkpoint also can give kopi $ to clear off?,btohqsg
Have sniper but also can see on Waze  other than that is if police see you and pull you over,btohqsg
The best they hide quite good one.. Not like SG cause they must be seen clearly for safety.,btohqsg
Erm  usually cannot at checkpoint because more honest officers,btohqsg
But anyway they take time to process,btohqsg
Wait my coilover next month laaa,btohqsg
They will actually sit in the median on the expressway all,btohqsg
Need make car look nice first before spending more $$ on mods that can’t be seen or rarely will use,btohqsg
Yes  extreme ricer  mod car for looks only,btohqsg
But what’s the penalty if I clock 200 ah?,btohqsg
And if kena those that cannot siam,btohqsg
Money at least still okay la,btohqsg
But serious what  if you whack 200 and kena caught in SG is jail  MY if you whack 200-300 and kena caught  you can probably afford to do it a couple of time and pay the fee mah,btohqsg
Idw kena ban with my nice car plate number leh,btohqsg
Jail really depends where you do it,btohqsg
Anyway if you're not stupid you will know how to avoid police,btohqsg
But I'm a bit concerned about the first part,btohqsg
HAHAHA you see this guy teach all the bad things,btohqsg
Also you're not hitting 200-300 on the highways,btohqsg
Maybe on the Penang like bridges can,btohqsg
Can try but not worth going over 200  monkey/cow/dog risk,btohqsg
I agree with the first part  still a virgin driving to MY after all,btohqsg
Somemore sometimes malaysian cars their tail light like no tail light,btohqsg
Don't whack anyhow first time then. Get used to the driving etiquette and ways first,btohqsg
Always got bigger fish on the road,btohqsg
No leh  the nice number came together with the dealership,btohqsg
You can easily check by trying to register vep,btohqsg
Other than that still got any other way?,btohqsg
I can just show proof that I recently purchased this car right,btohqsg
You're better off giving kopi money,btohqsg
Use Waze and keep a lookout,btohqsg
Honestly if they don’t like you  they’ll find a million reasons to stop you too,btohqsg
Even military vehicles will stop you at times if they think you're going to speed,btohqsg
Even though they have no jurisdiction,btohqsg
The first I went to JB,btohqsg
Siak I got shocked when I saw security holding shotgun,btohqsg
Most SG drivers have very poor driving and lane etiquette,btohqsg
They will actually give way one,btohqsg
You signal right at lane 1 they give way one,btohqsg
So need to flash once or tail a bit,btohqsg
Me do this in SG also,btohqsg
Flipping the bird is actually a way to say thanks,btohqsg
Don't teach him the wrong thing lah  later he kena whack come find you,btohqsg
Your address also so public on this chat,btohqsg
You're expected to move when something faster approaches as well,btohqsg

Ok safe  he thinks you run briyani store,btohqsg
But I shall pee on all,btohqsg
Ehh is go at like 2-3am,btohqsg
Aiya anyway take it as a travel expense,btohqsg
Travel le don’t think too much on money else will just stress yourself out and not enjoy it,btohqsg
I haven’t travel for past 3 years  think it’s time to just let loose anyway,btohqsg
Wah then why never go europe,btohqsg
Actually we were planning to go 12 days cruise to Japan then stay and fly back,btohqsg

Water will not fly on you also,btohqsg
Not a lot  a few drops,btohqsg
I was thinking fruit picking + quad bike  but since we there for a couple of days  also not like can do that the entire time,btohqsg
That one you must see skill and adjust speed,btohqsg
Got high risk of going overboard,btohqsg
Can do spa all in the hotel if you're into that,btohqsg

If you leave expensive things on your seats all out in the open to steal,btohqsg
Of course will get robbed one,btohqsg
Or stop in very shady places,btohqsg
Guys. A bit late to the track discussion. It doesn’t matter if slow but please watch your track etiquette especially if first time. Everyone starts somewhere. Remember if you see someone coming up fast  just pull to the side and let them overtake. Especially if you see a car going for that hot lap (going for timing). Let them pass early since you’re a slower car. Don’t go and block people. All enjoy and be safe!@SkyAudiA4,btohqsg
Ooo thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
So isit if I were to try and overtake  people will give way?,btohqsg
Be prepared to repair your own damages. Insurance doesn’t cover track drives. You get more respect from other drivers if you have etiquette.,btohqsg
If you’re clearly faster  usually yes. It’s not like in race  I block you block me one,btohqsg
First few times there focus on track interaction and getting used to the lines safely (and your car) before trying to push,btohqsg
I half wanted to but major deterrent is kena so many stone chips,btohqsg
Sly if u go track shud do coilovers,btohqsg
Also  pls prep your car a bit before even heading up. Basic routine ws checks,btohqsg
I hear some ppl got the drop n release bodykits,btohqsg
One for track one for normal use LOL,btohqsg
wa yes i saw one do all the fluid change,btohqsg
Likely get more stone chips driving too closely to people on nsh sir hahahaah,btohqsg
on NSHW either you're too slow to drive closely to someone or you're too fast everyone give way,btohqsg
You so lucky drive behind a truck they can also kick up stones,btohqsg
truck going 100-120 don't tell me cannot overtake bruh,btohqsg
Overtake of course lah but sometimes have to wait mah,btohqsg
worst is the lorries that try to overtake,btohqsg
Malaysians are actually very good drivers with etiquette on highway,btohqsg
They see you coming fast they will just give way without missing a heart beat,btohqsg
SG people always try try and block you LOL,btohqsg
the alphard/vellfire just highbeam from 50m away,btohqsg
Singapore hor…. They either don’t care coz they already at legal speed limit  or they give you fingers all  turn blue in face and extreme one go sgrv submit,btohqsg
Better that than 5cm behind flash you,btohqsg
i tried the right blinker to ask road hogger to move in sg before,btohqsg
I tell you sg drivers different,btohqsg
ya man they gave me the bombastic side eye question me like what i want,btohqsg
I think basic theory got teach: question - if you see car on lane 1 approaching from behind  do you1. Brake check2. Give way3. Signal back right and wave4. Slow down,btohqsg
BOMBASTIC SIDE EYE!  Wkwkwkwk I just learnt that the other day only,btohqsg
Sg got good drivers too lah but just saying there seem to be more ego trips and SDE from drivers here,btohqsg
HUH YOU THINK YOU DRIVE CONTI CAR VERY BIG?? YOU THINK YOU OVERTOOK ME WITH YOUR FASTER  LOUDER BMW YOU VERY GOOD? MY CAR ALSO CAN ONE. I TUNE TUNE ALL. NB I COME TAILGATE YOU ONE TIME,btohqsg
You should see the PHV group where they just pwn each other never ending one,btohqsg
Own people trying to cannibalise each other,btohqsg
EVEN THE MALAYSIAN PHV DRIVERS HELP EACH OTHER,btohqsg

you ever wonder why some Malaysian Alphards carrying Singaporeans to go JB can cross faster than us?,btohqsg
I PAY MORE TAXES SO I AM BETTER THAN YOU,btohqsg

Lane 3 overtaking can be dangerous so really make sure you have clear visibility and speed differential from lane 2 not too much. Cyclists  breakdowns  road works etc,btohqsg
In europe  inner lane overtaking can be illegal too in some places,btohqsg
