Guys  illegal mods to vehicles will get demerit points if caught?,btohqsg
I heard from a mechanic this morning  quite shocked,btohqsg
Demerit points considered mild Liao...if too extensive illegal mods..whole car get impounded,btohqsg
Dun think will get points get deducted laaa,btohqsg
Is the composite fines nia so far,btohqsg
Impounded I heard before  but usually swap engines mah right?,btohqsg
And more regular intervals for inspection annually,btohqsg
Not really....turbo...supercharged of NA engines oso kana,btohqsg
Pls go LTA website for more detailsüòÇ,btohqsg
I heard the mechanic said this lancer has extreme loud exhaust  tinted films on windows and lights  got escorted to inspection centre after that awarded 8 demerit points,btohqsg
Sekali one of the members here haha,btohqsg
nice. and the new IS300 too. good looking car,btohqsg
No points deduced for mods laaa,btohqsg
I think he otw to go swap then just nice spotted by LTA,btohqsg
they also know where you going to swap,btohqsg
Kana caught mean kana caught la....wad reasons cited not important,btohqsg
I just got back license if give me demerit points I will be very sad,btohqsg
Just bite bullet n pay fines when kana caught,btohqsg
Or else just dun do unapproved mods luh,btohqsg
don't do stupid things then nothing to catch,btohqsg
Here Singapore leh...so just follow the laws..easier to survive and less painful,btohqsg
Wan high performance..just get the performance type luh,btohqsg
Or else stick to the LTA approved mods,btohqsg
either change more powerful car  or do legal mods,btohqsg
U wan go dark side nowadays at Singapore.....extremely fast kana caught one,btohqsg
Is whether the LTA wan or  not nia,btohqsg
no money to do either  then play ps4,btohqsg
Turbo is count as exhaust mod,btohqsg
They will ask you remove and inspect as always,btohqsg
even if count as exhaust mod  exhaust not legal you also kena what,btohqsg
Turbo is consider engine mod..not exhaust mod I think,btohqsg
you know how turbos work right,btohqsg
turbo i think is exhaust  super charger count as engine,btohqsg
Exhaust consist of headers..midpipe and end muffler,btohqsg
Stock have turbo or NA add turbo.?,btohqsg
engine > turbo > exhaust ma,btohqsg
Turbo is spool from exhaust gas  then feed in clean air into engine,btohqsg
it's part of the exhaust system,btohqsg
For me .always been a NA man,btohqsg
Never into turbo engines..not sure how it work....,btohqsg
I have a friend he play quite hiong last time,btohqsg
anything illegal he can do he will do,btohqsg
So anything he kena before already,btohqsg
anyway  just saying  if you gonna play illegal exhaust already  just go all out. Turbo also lup inside.,btohqsg
Lolx....best luck to that level üòÅ,btohqsg
Be friendly to LTA and TP,btohqsg
most of the time they wont disturb you,btohqsg
Usually the sound and fumes attract the attention,btohqsg
I know of alot of people that run turbo for awhile,btohqsg
Nobody ask you to rev so hard and change your blow off valve to PSSSHHHHH so loud,btohqsg
you see TP just drive slowly  they wont even hear your turbo,btohqsg
Idling will do Liao if u go all out to mod,btohqsg
drive beside those do pops and bangs can already,btohqsg
your car full livery but stock,btohqsg
higher chance to get stop compared to stock looking car with turbo inside,btohqsg
this one penalty higher. Just saying,btohqsg
Kena caught change engine back ü§™,btohqsg
Driving one with full livery for 4yrs..never get stoppedüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Turbo is the most bang for buck,btohqsg
and you get so much power,btohqsg
For Na not turbo put turbo,btohqsg
My old car i drive 3 years nv kena stop  change owner 1st day kena alr,btohqsg
