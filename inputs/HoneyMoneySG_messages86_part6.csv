The miles earn rate need to be 4 mpd and above to make sense for me,btohqsg
There are many factors to consider. Example interest rates  your age  what do you want to use the cash / Cpf if you continue to pay the loan   are you leveraging  etc‚Ä¶so it‚Äôs not a simple answer but rather it varies across different spectrum of ppl,btohqsg
I figure it is about 3mpd to be significantly beneficial. If I value at 1.5 cents per mile.Using uob krisflyer as example3mpd x 1.5 cents - 2.5% amaze spread = 2% net benefit still. And still have amaze points too.,btohqsg
hi guys if i sign up for card A  make the minimum spend to get whatever welcome rewards they have  then cancel the card subsequently (maybe after 12 months or so)  will this affect credit score or affect me negatively whatsoever?,btohqsg
Not that im aware of =),btohqsg
Bc theres quite a few attractive welcome rewards which essentially subsidizes your spending for that month  and to my knowledge cancelling after 12 months does not affect users negatively?,btohqsg
Technically theres nth wrong if you are strictly out for their sign up rewards,btohqsg
Then after you cancel and you wait 12 mths den u can sign up again as a new to bank customer,btohqsg

Also if uob one account and ocbc 360 account both 100k already   then where else is good for next high interest ?,btohqsg
PayNow through FAST (standard PayNow) and PayNow through GIRO are 2 separate systems so no,btohqsg
So my choices are limited to UOB one for now  am i correct?,btohqsg
And DBS multiplier. Even OCBC 360 requires PayNow through GIRO at the minimum.,btohqsg
Why not? Just go on the app and do temporary block lor. When need to use just unblock.,btohqsg

Hi all! Any recommendations for credit cards? Currently using ocbc360 account  was thinking if I should just apply one of these cards 365  infinity  nxt  90¬∞n or rewards to stack on the ocbc360 interest?,btohqsg
spending habits? what do you prefer  cashback or miles?,btohqsg
Prefer cashback. Depending but spend about 500-1000 a month,btohqsg
maybe infinity but 1.6% cashback is a bit low. but for the extra interest worth it lah,btohqsg
