"Qm ChargesOn 1 November 2023  Tay was charged in the State Courts of Singapore for allegedly distributing an intimate photo and video of a woman performing a sex act without the woman's consent  sending them to users in Telegram and in two chat groups.[7][8] He returned to court on 16 November to face the charges.[9]On 11 December  it was announced that Tay would be facing more charges. However  as the prosecution was not ready  the case was adjourned for four weeks to January 2024. Tay also hired a lawyer  Rohit Kumar Singh from Regal Law.[1] On 10 January  his additional charges were read out. This included a harassment-related charge for Tay purportedly asking for help with hiring a killer and saying he wanted someone to die ""ASAP""  also using vulgarities in his message.[8]On multiple occasions  Tay was heckled when he emerged from the State Courts' front doors.[10][1][9] Through his lawyer  Tay mentioned that the harassing and heckling had caused grief to his family  and he would be making police reports.[8]Cases of harassment against TayKurt Tay had been a victim of harassment by the members of the public on multiple occasions.In 2015 and early 2016  a group of three men  Singaporeans Aaron James Ang Jian Hian  Royston Chua Wei Kwang  and Malaysian Patrick Chong distributed flyers containing nude photos of Tay at Tay's HDB block in Yishun as well as Northpoint City where Tay worked. Ang and Chua were later charged and sentenced to six months and five months' imprisonment respectively.[11][12]In 2019  a person impersonating a Mediacorp staff invited Tay for an interview  as well as to film an episode of a comedy series  at the Mediacorp TV station. However when Tay showed up at the TV station  he was denied entry. Tay filed a police report.[13]Personal lifeIn 2013  Tay married Kim Ngan  a mail-order bride from Vietnam. They had a son in 2018 and a daughter in 2021.[14]",btohqsg
