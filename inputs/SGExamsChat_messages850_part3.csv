Ppl say chemistry is actually very complicated physics   true to some extent,btohqsg
why did i sign myself up for this,btohqsg
I heard the China version of a level (they also got sciences and arts stream too) their chemistry is as tough too,btohqsg
hot take: i personally would prefer having something like gaokao in sg,btohqsg
Think Chinese students who experience gaokao see a levels as similar difficulty,btohqsg
Provided the papers are translated properly 😅😅,btohqsg
One thing I probably won't like about Gaokao and Korean CSAT is the fact that you have to finish whole set in 8 to 9 hours,btohqsg
gaokao is 100× harder than the a levels,btohqsg
My o levels was suppose to test organic chem  covid took that topic out,btohqsg
Paper went from 80 marks to 60 marks after the common last topic was taken out,btohqsg
Oh the last common topics thingymabob,btohqsg
Yes for physics it was magnetism,btohqsg
Yea o level organic was easier to memorise,btohqsg
For maths it was probability I think,btohqsg
No because what is the pt,btohqsg
Because of this some jc students didn't study vector in o level e Math,btohqsg
And had to study basics at a levels instead,btohqsg
Yea imagine me being a n level student whom alr had common last topic taken out then go onto o levels and same thing happens,btohqsg
He would've done better in gaokao than o level,btohqsg
Thanks for enlightening me randkmdkd  I couldnt have arrived at that conclusion without you 💚,btohqsg
No problem I hope that u getting nett 6 for o levels made u happy,btohqsg
But I didnt take o levels  😡 this is erasure and you are not Holding Space for me 😭,btohqsg
Omg are u a RI IP STUDENT,btohqsg
No  I signed on after PSLE to serve our nation 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬,btohqsg
Well I have friends who are home schooled 😅😅,btohqsg
No surprises as I know all kinds of family dynamics 👍 seen enough,btohqsg
I thought the minimum age to serve military is 16.5 right?,btohqsg
So if sec school students drop out they serve at 16 ?,btohqsg
I never seen this before tough,btohqsg
But at 16  not much guys would like to do that,btohqsg
Some countries laws are strange like US   you are allowed to serve military at 18 but only allowed intoxicants like alcohol at 21 if not wrong,btohqsg
Is like saying ppl can sacrifice their life for country at 18 but drinking they set at 21,btohqsg
Singapore you are allowed to serve military at 18 but only allowed to vote at 21,btohqsg
Is like saying ppl can sacrifice their life for country at 18 but voting they set at 21,btohqsg
Which I would argue military is more dangerous than alcohol yeah,btohqsg
True but also not the youngest age possible tbh,btohqsg
16.5 is apparently the legal age to enter NS,btohqsg
We cant even smoke ciggs at 18,btohqsg
Wyatt What happened to your profile photo? 😁,btohqsg
Can we ask home work questions here or no,btohqsg
See the relevant O Level and A Level chats,btohqsg
Is there a uni chat group?,btohqsg
Think can join a level chat group .... some universities topic overlap with a levels and Poly Math,btohqsg
A levels doesn’t have Multivariate calc,btohqsg
What MV calc are you talking about anywayd,btohqsg
Oh okay does anyone have the a level group,btohqsg
Can I send the pic here,btohqsg
I have to find 4 stationary points but I can only find 2,btohqsg
Lowkey I think the teacher assumed a symmetrical case but didnt realised y=z so they’re equivalent points,btohqsg
did you get up to here,btohqsg
