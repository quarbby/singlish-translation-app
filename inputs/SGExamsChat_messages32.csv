I thought he was a girl,btohqsg
Why girl cannot be called by sergeant?,btohqsg
He might identify as one  I wouldn't know unless I ask him  let me try it later,btohqsg
unless someday they want to reclaim land and tear my house down for hdb,btohqsg
Jermaine i think ur the only girl here,btohqsg

Idk  I know a 30 year old who hooked up with a 16 year old,btohqsg
I think never too old ba  it‚Äôs just what type of life you are enjoying,btohqsg
here for a good time not a long time,btohqsg
Old ppl have rheumatism and shit,btohqsg
More proof that everything you think about is relationships,btohqsg
‚ÄúIf I get corona  I get corona‚Äù,btohqsg
Yep  and I was pretty disgusted cuz it's also against the law,btohqsg
if get $10k fine and go to jail just get $10k fine and go to jail,btohqsg
Dog got buns lonely date man baby,btohqsg
It's legal if the guy is within 3 years age range,btohqsg
looking for someone to eat lettuce with together on a rainy day,btohqsg
16 and above is fair game LOL,btohqsg
But idk why u would fk a 16 yr old girl LOL,btohqsg
Damn  I had this friend who told me it was 3 years,btohqsg
have you seen those Sginstababes xmm,btohqsg
Was she by any chance more than 3 years younger than you,btohqsg
Bc I was asked to join,btohqsg
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have Instagram so I don‚Äôt have access to the fruits of sginstababes,btohqsg
I assume this means some people think you are attractive,btohqsg
WTF THATS APPROPRIATION OF THE WORD EWWW,btohqsg
obscene kind or just normal ig photos,btohqsg
So I don't know what's the difference,btohqsg
No  bc ppl show me screenshots,btohqsg
Your photo with some pretty fucked up captions right? A lot of my friends are up there,btohqsg
Huh  wonder what you‚Äôre doing over there,btohqsg
if its the former pls do smtg,btohqsg
if its the latter jz ignore,btohqsg
I made a youtube video and probably got like $1 from adsense,btohqsg
Always remember  what goes on internet stays on internet,btohqsg
Technically they don't own the personality rights AFAIK though,btohqsg
And stumbled into the xmm section did you,btohqsg
why yall all looking for xmm,btohqsg
yeah but too much effort to go tell them take it down etcc right,btohqsg
Also remember  everyone on the internet is male until proven otherwise,btohqsg
normal la  obscene I die liao,btohqsg
Because eXtra Mathematical Mathematics DESERVES MORE,btohqsg
Ur life will return to normal in like,btohqsg
It's funny how things like that happen,btohqsg
so ur into getting fucked by xmm,btohqsg
it has become a point where any women who looks thin is called the word 'xmm',btohqsg
Someone has been impersonating me for like a year,btohqsg
then if they're a bit obese then tell them to lose weight,btohqsg
No la got behaviour traits one,btohqsg
then if too skinny u ask them if they got eat,btohqsg
Thats the problem with having big instagram follower lists,btohqsg
Its a lot easier just to have a small instagram,btohqsg
This is prolly the most loaded question ever asked here lmao,btohqsg
Whats ur definition of many followers,btohqsg
one of your followers think u chio then take ur pic share,btohqsg
Message from d deleted. Reason: @-link to channel(?),btohqsg
I think i probably just pissed someone off,btohqsg
a few boys looking for xmms here,btohqsg
But yes and no are just two choices of answers. The joy of English is to express and communicate one's will that allows the reader or listener to truly understand what is being meant.,btohqsg
I think more than 150 is a lot already,btohqsg
i here to look for john smith,btohqsg
Why the fuck does anyone need a large IG following,btohqsg
Can somebody create a No Tinder crossover sticker pack? Thanks,btohqsg
I only let those who i know personally follow,btohqsg
post one story with a product,btohqsg
Even if it switches to Ohana,btohqsg
What did the xmms do to you,btohqsg
Okay it‚Äôs no easy from personal experience,btohqsg
Den u incur the risk lor,btohqsg
That someone gnna take ue photo,btohqsg
no la it's the owner himself,btohqsg
Why u say u r a commando LOL,btohqsg
what is the definition of xmm sia,btohqsg
never know who is in this group,btohqsg
hahaha btw they did nth LMAOO,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
I meant girls can be commando elsewhere,btohqsg
maybe im just uncomfortable at how the owner kinda sexualizes those girls,btohqsg
So you‚Äôre against sexuality in general or,btohqsg
The definition is that.Let (S  <=) be a directed set. Let T be a set. Let f:S->T be a mapping.Then S is a xmm in T.,btohqsg
Like innocent so they can groom them,btohqsg
What version of xmm is in your minds,btohqsg
@FiskalPolicihow u change from discord to tele so fast,btohqsg
They knew what they were getting into,btohqsg
Not xiao mei mei as in Â∞èÂ¶πÂ¶π,btohqsg
"Are you also ""young and innocent""",btohqsg
Some may argue that society forced them to sexualise themselves,btohqsg
Xmm as in yp  ah lian  dye hair xmm,btohqsg
Idt anyone in my cohort fits ur definition of xmm,btohqsg
Thats like taking autonomy away from women,btohqsg
Like they are incapable of making decisions for themselves,btohqsg
Ya ik but the owner himself took advantage of that??,btohqsg
Sign up to be a service dog,btohqsg
Are you capable of making the decision of serving NS for yourself?,btohqsg
u more degen on discord than here,btohqsg
Is it taking advantage or is it just a deal between 2 rational humans,btohqsg
Making me think more THANK U,btohqsg
Apparently there were cases he molested the girls,btohqsg
What does it mean to be an irrational human? Is it that a human cannot divide by another human,btohqsg
Anyone got good sources to recommend,btohqsg
bruh you know the whole saga of *redacted*,btohqsg
Sure I recommend OpenMathNotes by AMS.,btohqsg
Thats why u dont see the wild people,btohqsg
I hate condiments except Chili sauce,btohqsg
you know who's the most wild? the 2 NUS students that breached their SHN,btohqsg
Unless you've the intelligence  time management and hardwork,btohqsg
every school have xmm ba haha,btohqsg
Come find one at my jc,btohqsg
one of the underlying mysteries in sgexams is that john smith is a state of a mind,btohqsg
"TBH I feel like they will get suspended for sure. Expulsion IDK. ""bright future"" after all",btohqsg
2 or 3 yrs ur senior,btohqsg
Hm we dont know until they say,btohqsg
As dangerously close as danger close?,btohqsg
Are u from a chinese Sec school in the west,btohqsg
looking to get average 90 rp,btohqsg

Sgexams can we have Minecraft server pls,btohqsg

@cauchycriterionu do know u and the peeps from school 5 are kind of the reason why my stay in is late lol,btohqsg

Ask govt close school so we can organise this,btohqsg
Sgexams got brawl stars clan or not,btohqsg
i didnt know sgexams became grindr,btohqsg
uhc is university health centre to me hahaha,btohqsg
Real question is whether they can find the other 1 tho,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like hunger games in minecraft,btohqsg
none of you in sgexams would survive in The Hunger Games,btohqsg
maybe its a 1v1 video game,btohqsg
but tbh whats wrong with him,btohqsg
Wait so can I join the discord,btohqsg
no the discord is closed down,btohqsg
And putting first choice hci second choice early childhood care,btohqsg
You can but you‚Äôd have to leave this grp,btohqsg
first of all  you're a fish,btohqsg
but you might want to swim away frm the players lest they catch u for food,btohqsg
you have to sell away your soul and sanity if you wanna join the discord server,btohqsg
Who here actually plays mine craft on the sgexams server,btohqsg
no leh  getting better these few days IMO,btohqsg
econs teachers are crackheads but every other department is alrigalright,btohqsg
why minecraft when you can play roblox,btohqsg
bvss was a sch i was considering during psle,btohqsg
where is your bedok viewian pride,btohqsg
"last time the parents ard my neighborhood be like ""üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ bedok schs""",btohqsg
Someone answer me on discord leh,btohqsg
Not the location of the sch itseld,btohqsg
bedok south i think ok leh,btohqsg
But I'll take down the image later,btohqsg
I mean I went to tms so,btohqsg
they prob ran out of ideas,btohqsg
i went tms after psle release,btohqsg
Why are there no jcs near sengkang,btohqsg
Find what? It's inside the discord,btohqsg
i dont recall having a lake,btohqsg
but now got lift and aircon,btohqsg
What does modded mc server mean,btohqsg
the students are mostly chill la  but got a few muggers lor,btohqsg

@andrewomeWhat mods did you install on the server,btohqsg
When ur R5 all A1 but L1 D7,btohqsg
ok ni lai liao  got MC ppls,btohqsg
i think the worst guy i knew in my batch still went poly,btohqsg
I never set up the software,btohqsg
idk if this is worse or getting straight A2s,btohqsg
worse cos u cant even graduate,btohqsg
A2 = A level A grade equivalent,btohqsg
You do realise YIJC didn‚Äôt exist during her time,btohqsg
english get D7 still can go poly,btohqsg
it didnt rly end up that way,btohqsg
my pure sciences were both 2s,btohqsg
i legit thought YIJC was always there,btohqsg
and my a math was a 3,btohqsg
pure chem and pure bio both 2,btohqsg
but my math rly cmi so h1 math kek,btohqsg
icic  mine was emath 1  amath 3,btohqsg
Mines a math and pure bio 2 pure chem 4,btohqsg
i rmb my sch year the fkin MSG for emath siao lang,btohqsg
i got my C6 higher chinese,btohqsg
ikr  for a cohort to hit such an msg is amazeballs,btohqsg
same  i not hci so i cmi also,btohqsg
I tot u said u my senior,btohqsg
as in i had friends that mostly went hci,btohqsg
my friends mostly went Ri or nanyang,btohqsg
lol no point seeing 2.5  3.3   4.1,btohqsg
cut off for hci was 3/4,btohqsg
Now the cutoff is lower cos of eunoia,btohqsg
It‚Äôs cause of merger of JCs,btohqsg
just study hard enough to hit a decently high A for every subject can alr,btohqsg
ya easier to go ri hci now,btohqsg
no need study so hard until brain sot  no point,btohqsg
but maybe bc of bigger batch or more schs,btohqsg
Wat if I want to go to Baffles,btohqsg
oh my is this flex time,btohqsg
And get stumped by the math qns,btohqsg
RI have one  VJ have one,btohqsg
We have assigned seating in canteens now,btohqsg
Go to MI to escape covid,btohqsg
whats the 50th percentile for psle,btohqsg
We're very safe  excepts complaints frm the public that the students are too close to each despite the 1m thing,btohqsg
3 students spanked me for GP,btohqsg
RI and HCI are not Oxbridge,btohqsg
my tutor was talking about that during GP lmao,btohqsg
Would have been top in cohort for GP,btohqsg
GP only matters if u want law,btohqsg
Thats why its an easy subject to do well,btohqsg
the ppl who complaint are probably the ones also doing the same thing too,btohqsg
My debate coach got B for GP,btohqsg
U wanna see my tragic math percentiles in sec sch,btohqsg
my gp tutor masters degree in law,btohqsg
And maybe the person met up w his grp of friends aft he sent a complaint letter,btohqsg
What happened to being a lawyer,btohqsg
My GP teacher in J1 studied law before becoming a teacher,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt want to become a lawyer,btohqsg
Then why is he/she teaching GP,btohqsg
job security is her main reason,btohqsg
*gasps* were they at least 1m apart??,btohqsg
At least we don‚Äôt have to score A*,btohqsg
And then followed by passion of teaching,btohqsg
Did u take this pic upside down on purpose,btohqsg
I can relate to your a math score,btohqsg
but other than that your grades quite good sia,btohqsg
Must have really been a terrible student,btohqsg
I slept in every single math class,btohqsg
when everyone be flexing their report book,btohqsg
And the math teacher was my form teacher,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the chat‚Äôs most active day in a long while,btohqsg
I am proud of everyone here,btohqsg
I never did any math tutorial in JC after maybe the first few,btohqsg
My study habit for math in jc,btohqsg
Still can get all correct in exam,btohqsg
Read through revision package but dont do,btohqsg
Just think abt the method u would use,btohqsg
Game all day and jio ppl out but then u go home and mug till 4 am,btohqsg
When I was j1 I had to practice j2 math qns just to jump to a C frm U and you DONT NEED TO?!?!?!,btohqsg
Tbh some people study better mugging at home,btohqsg
I didnt practice and was hardstuck E,btohqsg
He has had a much faster education than you did,btohqsg
how do even people concentrate at sbux or cbtl,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bit like me bragging that I can do O Level paper without any prep,btohqsg
Lmao i rmb sec 4 prelims,btohqsg
My emath B3 only 43 percentile wtf,btohqsg
the year i graduated two of the sec 3s were filmed doing bad things in the toilet,btohqsg
we didnt have percentiles in sec sch,btohqsg
Lmao i constantly failed amath amd got A2 for Os,btohqsg
the only way u knew ur percentile is if u kenna called on stage,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think I can for pure chemistry,btohqsg
and ppl tell u ur 1st 2nd or 3rd,btohqsg
If you suck at math  there are people that suck worse than you,btohqsg
I rmb jc during our time they removed level position,btohqsg
But i knew my level position during j2 prelims,btohqsg
Ah  those are good things then,btohqsg
and then my friend sent the video to the principap,btohqsg
But in all  fk jc tbh,btohqsg
Class and level position made things more toxic tbh,btohqsg
They also stopped releasing percentiles for my sch,btohqsg
Its the easy route to some uni courses,btohqsg
jc prelims was btr than actual avlsl,btohqsg
Probably an across the board move,btohqsg
Idk eh i found a lvls harder but more fun,btohqsg
Good thing is that only my primary school and half of my secondary school life had this,btohqsg
Only subject that was a fkin joke was chem,btohqsg
I‚Äôm 80+ percentile... in the worst jc in sg,btohqsg
U are equivalent to the 30th percentile in RI,btohqsg
Lets just say thos was the only jc i stood a chance of getting into,btohqsg
they dont give us a total percentile,btohqsg
Was everyone smart af or sth,btohqsg
Its not abt smarts or what,btohqsg
Percentile is as good as level position tbh,btohqsg
Back then i can game all day,btohqsg
y the discord become computer sci channel ah,btohqsg
And of course  knowing how to use it appropriately,btohqsg
If positioning is toxic  why r we endorsing percentiles,btohqsg
Just spam papers a month before the exams,btohqsg
u can try for A levels  goodluck,btohqsg
I know i‚Äôm screwed if i did,btohqsg
I intend to do prelim papers for every subject from every 15+ point jc before As,btohqsg
have to see how smart the person in question is,btohqsg
well  u cant use it if u dont have any knoweldge of amath  like me,btohqsg
if they can absorb info like mad,btohqsg
I‚Äôd do the elite sch ones,btohqsg
elite sch papers not necessarily the best,btohqsg
nah our papers are generally more difficult than actual A levels,btohqsg
i got teach elite students who struggle at JJC prelim papers,btohqsg
My school chem prelims too easy,btohqsg
is it true that elite jcs hv one set of answers for internal circulation,btohqsg
You‚Äôd be abit not smart if you judge the quality of Teachers based on academic achievements of students in the school,btohqsg
bio just burn and memorise the RJ H2 Bio summary,btohqsg
The hard ones are not from the supposed elite ones,btohqsg
Do NYJC paper for Maths  FM  Chem,btohqsg
the guy who sets these papers,btohqsg
the chem guy will tell u to drop,btohqsg
So rj for bio  ny for chem and math,btohqsg
The arts have a world of their own,btohqsg
HCI maths I recall set some good papers,btohqsg
imo hc chem harder than ny chem,btohqsg
Another one to take note of,btohqsg
but hc chem papers recently becoming more and more like a joke,btohqsg
featured prominently at our college reception,btohqsg
