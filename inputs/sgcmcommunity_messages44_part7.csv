Not sure because I'm thinking of installing some lights for my car roof interior but if too bright  it may distract other drivers so I guess that would be considered illegal😂,btohqsg
TP can’t stop you if they can’t chase you,btohqsg
They can get good pictures of the driver since lighting is so good in the car 🤭,btohqsg
I think don’t blind you can already,btohqsg
I put led strips in my car,btohqsg
Yours look like what from outside😂,btohqsg
Rmb to submit your dashcam footage to us if you do that LOL,btohqsg
Front cam nothing captured coz he is too fast,btohqsg
Interior okay  exterior dont on while driving. I assume you are having underglow  only on while stationary,btohqsg
technically its a grey area but play safe dont on while driving,btohqsg
I see if I can find pictures,btohqsg
Finish my build then I put,btohqsg
ahaha which one u planning on buying,btohqsg
Personal car not sure will check thoroughly. Standard is Stars 🌟 LED roof. Or two long bar LED like the Alphard/Vellfire. Or console LED strip. During inspection don't on la😂Only Commercial van they check thoroughly,btohqsg
@JCVAGwatching the COE closely to make a decision on your car?,btohqsg
Interior lights can be as bright as you want I believe,btohqsg
A good model I've seen on a few people's cars is the Cardi k3,btohqsg
You can try looking for that one as it is more consistent across the panel and not brighter at the end,btohqsg
Waiting for the price to drop back down,btohqsg
i’m looking at the vrs estate,btohqsg
So I guess next year minimally,btohqsg
yup! more worth that way for sure,btohqsg
I think stock will have one. Maybe just waiting time longer.,btohqsg
For me  I rather not overpay and gold more cash now,btohqsg
but sometimes waiting time can be quite ridiculous,btohqsg
Gues it rlly depends on luck,btohqsg
in that case can start looking for other options alr,btohqsg
But if you have the capital  you can always go ahead first.,btohqsg
Hmm another option for me is avante,btohqsg
but that capital can be used better if coe drops hehe,btohqsg
Disco light and smoke machine cannot 😂,btohqsg
smoke machine would be quite sick tbh hahaha,btohqsg
Ya don't on it during inspection 😂,btohqsg
