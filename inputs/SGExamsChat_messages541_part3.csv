i did say before you can dm me for anyth,btohqsg
Better than my ndp period where our singer could not even sing the national anthem correctly,btohqsg
Anyway that band major is a major fuckwad irl so,btohqsg
Then the next verse …totally slaughtered it with “kembagan”,btohqsg
Don’t ask me how dengan semangat yang baru can become “kembagan yang baru”,btohqsg
But by the end  we gave that guy the most embarrassing applause I’ve ever heard,btohqsg
Was it the slow clap one,btohqsg
Trust me  the only thing clapping was not hands,btohqsg
Lmao welcome to new age maths,btohqsg
non 2x2 matrix and the methods aren’t just used for inverse,btohqsg
also for solving system of equations,btohqsg
3x3 also not that hard what,btohqsg
4x4 uw hand solve also can but ull die,btohqsg
gaussian elimination is also a name,btohqsg
idk but it seems p common sense,btohqsg
crammers rule is js the 1/determinant times the adjoint of the matrix,btohqsg
if qn ask u doing one method then yeah y need the name what,btohqsg
their question literally says to use the specific method with the name so ya,btohqsg
your 2x2 formula for inverse is based on crammers rule,btohqsg
adj A which is the transpose of your cofactor matrix,btohqsg
turns out conventionally gauss jordan specifically is used to refer to eliminating all the way to reduced row echelon,btohqsg
then gaussian elimination is js the row reduction,btohqsg
so ig if the question specifies the former then need to go all the way,btohqsg
