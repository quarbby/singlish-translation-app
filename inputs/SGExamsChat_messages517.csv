If u can save sch fee jus go asap,btohqsg
Most Mp happy to help u one,btohqsg
Eh actually how u get the 6k in cash to pay em arh?,btohqsg
Did u get a loan or smth?,btohqsg
Anyway best to get the status confirmed cos future other things like BTO Uni Job all got impacted,btohqsg
I mean at least your family can afford it I guess.. means uni fees they might complain less once u become Singaporean,btohqsg
Plug and a crossed out sign,btohqsg
im wondering if i shld RSO now,btohqsg

Now 42 years old me 2-2,btohqsg
Anyone knows if O lvls Chem Pract  can bring in QA notes  cations  anions etc,btohqsg
Thats why now come sign on mah,btohqsg
But tbf he tell me last time technician bohua one,btohqsg
Nt rlly hentak from what i heard  coz he sign on late,btohqsg
Normally is 33 years old promote to 3-1,btohqsg
But now i heard st engineering better,btohqsg
Coz my vocation deal w them quite frequently,btohqsg
Got one guy i heard  uni come out deal with coding and stuff earning 8k,btohqsg
If only yall seen the saf‚Äôs next gen Hunter Afv,btohqsg

they saying got something still need settle,btohqsg
so wing com say 1st June we get,btohqsg
At least it isn't like hospitals that one still on XP,btohqsg
Bruh which hospital u go to sia all the gahmen hospitals the tech is old af,btohqsg
Both are relatively new hospitals lol,btohqsg
Go SGH  TTSH then u will find the way,btohqsg
Yeah bro that's why I say SKGH and KTPH didn't even exist when XP was the main OS,btohqsg
ur test this week or next week,btohqsg
i got a bad asf headache üíÄ,btohqsg
It's mainly run on stuff that like it will not be worth it to update like the ultrasound machine interface and MRI interface,btohqsg
also last temp check i did 38.3 üíÄ,btohqsg
i hope tmrw i get MC cuz,btohqsg
Take Ibuprofen rn to lower it first,btohqsg
i see first if its there tho,btohqsg
ye ik thats why i go tmrw,btohqsg
at least skip tmrw can alr,btohqsg
U take Blanket as many as possible then cover your entire body,btohqsg
What he want it to stay what,btohqsg
SBB ggwp üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
But if he do that I cannot guarantee it won't go away when u want it to la,btohqsg
i got 37.5 once  report to PTMC,btohqsg
Rookie u need to get 38 and above for the maximum payoff,btohqsg
actually 2D but i say is bookout day the day after so MO extend,btohqsg
üóø nahh 3D was enough  book out alr,btohqsg
time to get excuse RMJ permanent LOL,btohqsg
Do anyone actually volunteer for those things or are most just forced to?,btohqsg
i rather RSI for gay to pes f than go NDP,btohqsg
Just say u JV can liao üôÉ idk if that reason still valid tho,btohqsg
I mean when u gather thousands of people what u expect sia,btohqsg
Now NDP won't have such a problem liao,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone here with o level pure bio notes cuz the one in the library is kinda long and not apt for current syllabus. Thanks!,btohqsg
I didn't read up on the followup but I think all of them survived right? Like was anything even broken?,btohqsg
Wonder if any of those down pes or not,btohqsg
i feel so bad to the point i wanna die,btohqsg
ok body keep up this standard,btohqsg
later i get shit MO give LD lanjiao,btohqsg
U take hot water then make a hot pack,btohqsg
Eh NS covered under the Work Injury Compensation Act or not,btohqsg
No like it ain't even covered as it's NS for the WICA act.,btohqsg
There's probably some SAF equivalent for workplace injury compensation probably la but it sucks that WICA cannot cover,btohqsg
imagine ur ck RSI goes so bad üíÄ,btohqsg
But they have to be declared or found only in NS rite?,btohqsg
As i said la this method has the unintended side effec of working too well which when u hit 39C then it starts to be a problem,btohqsg
got something in my eye i cannot remove,btohqsg
and its the good eye üíÄ,btohqsg
gonna make it worse for RSI tmrw,btohqsg
i have an eye problem where my left eye cant move left and right at all,btohqsg
Bruh I ain't a lawyer but I am pretty sure that won't stand up in court in terms of liability :/,btohqsg
i went to specialist and he said by right i not supposed to be combat fit in the first place,btohqsg
now my NS is 1y10m so,btohqsg
Yeah I was gonna say that's not something that makes u combat fit,btohqsg
suppsoed to go for 2y but,btohqsg
The context of this clip makes your statement even better,btohqsg
Cuz 5 mins later the controls broke and he had to get Richard and James to make the RV stop,btohqsg
Cuz it ain't a law I suspect its probably just a SAF internal policy to be able to say that they protect against such injuries.,btohqsg
Basically you cannot even sue SAF in court cuz the law provides them immunity,btohqsg
Pray it ain't a slipped disc or smth,btohqsg
But either ways by your description if it's true it would be a chronic condition alr nonetheless,btohqsg
eh i need ask u sth,btohqsg
Classic reasoning the other is cuz u keep looking at your phone,btohqsg
Ok I don't mean to go on a tangent here but a stocks price has no indication as to the size of a company or its value,btohqsg
The more accurate measure would be market cap,btohqsg
Until u zoom out on the 5 year time frame,btohqsg
No my point was that ppl that bought in 2021 NVDA now only see a breakeven,btohqsg
2022 was a horrible year for stocks,btohqsg
Rn we don't even have the YTD performance yet and the year hasn't end yet,btohqsg
I am heavily weighted in banks and even then I am pretty much untouched tbh,btohqsg
The biggest burn I had was Credit Suisse,btohqsg
But at least I bought shares and not the idiots who bought the CET1 bonds,btohqsg
30 cents on the dollar cuz if not the Swiss executives are gonna have a fun time when the Saudi Arabians invite them for some fun.,btohqsg
But the most volatile stocks are a different sector.. makes me sick when ever I look at it,btohqsg
But one thing i learn abt stocks is dont expose your position until u sold,btohqsg
Or just keep your mouth shut,btohqsg
Coz cfm people gonna say shit one,btohqsg
It's the nature of Biotech stocks cuz of the phases of drug approval,btohqsg
So a stock can shoot up 1000% on a single press release that kind,btohqsg
I mean u can if its blue chips,btohqsg
Having Options and Futures approval for me was a death sentence,btohqsg
Temasek holdings is not a company one can just buy stocks in..,btohqsg
Na bro just go for the too big to fail banks..,btohqsg
Any bank in the bulge bracket is fair game,btohqsg
Exactly why it was part of my investment thesis,btohqsg
Wah everytime i come online i always see E120 and kuro,btohqsg

Bro has higher authority than the medical board,btohqsg
I aiming for Pes E originally but I am always an overachiever,btohqsg
Ya sial I wanted pes E but kena Pes A lmao,btohqsg

@chemcer@Voidchordsmy fever and headache almost gone üíÄ,btohqsg
this time gonna use the forbidden wild card,btohqsg
based on the trees and roads  not familiar with the scenery but is it the section btwn bukit gombak and Choa Chu Kang?,btohqsg
should be leaving bukit gombak and heading to CCK üëÄ,btohqsg
yea i think im wrong :/,btohqsg
Anyone knows if O lvls Chem Pract  can bring in QA notes  tests for cations  anions etc,btohqsg
What kind of qn is that HAHAHA,btohqsg
if u talking Abt QA table it's given on the last page,btohqsg
Hw the QA table looks like ah,btohqsg
Ain‚Äôt  the whole QA shit behind the exam booklet,btohqsg
She / he probs private candi,btohqsg
Cuz my students aso ask me HAha,btohqsg
open book doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy,btohqsg
i liked it bcz can play with chemical,btohqsg
yes it is  the QA sheet is behind your paper,btohqsg
however  teachers generally advise students to sort of ‚Äòmemorise‚Äô bcz trust me you won‚Äôt have enuf time flipping back and forth,btohqsg
you can actually practise practical without doing it,btohqsg
bruh if only I didn‚Äôt throw my practical book,btohqsg
Don't need memorize the cations & anions with Naoh etc? The observations results?,btohqsg
wait ah I do smt first,btohqsg
Just memorize in case paper 3 comes out XD,btohqsg
fml time to dig out my chem brain,btohqsg
wah brain lag alr shouldn‚Äôt have thrown away my notes ü•≤ü•≤ i want to teach comb chem freelance js 1/2 students but,btohqsg
do you have the practical book?,btohqsg
okay let‚Äôs just say  you must memorise your acid and basesso let‚Äôs say they sayadd hcl to calcium carbonateso u identify  hcl is the acid   calcium carbonate is a base (a metal carbonate to be specific)hence when acid + metal carbonate reacts what do you get ?the salt itself  co2 and water.so your product will be calcium chloride  co2 and water.but in practical  you can just identify what you observe. eg. effervescence observed which is the bubbles you see when it produces gas which would be co2 in this case (I think  send help neko ),btohqsg
and you see i did all these without even adding the substances itself. so it is possible,btohqsg
r u doing pure or combined?,btohqsg
not sure if this is the one in line with your syllabus but should be ba,btohqsg
if uw  you can purchase an extra book in case ur sch uses it in class,btohqsg
in my case  my sch barely touched on it so i just self practised with this,btohqsg
however i don‚Äôt suggest practising it until prolly 1 month before the real exam,btohqsg
@Voidchordsy‚Äôall have to agree this one of those times pocoyo is actually helpful and not spouting nonsense ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
where are all the jc kids at? valerie hui ting y‚Äôall alive still?,btohqsg
oh no.. that didn‚Äôt happen i still F üòÖ,btohqsg
bcz i studied a little too late ba,btohqsg
U either live long enough to be a J2 or dropout at J1,btohqsg
saw a bird kill a small baby lizard then swallow it whole,btohqsg
The circle of life. Now kill that bird to show them that humans are the top of the pyramid,btohqsg
shld be the other way round cuz you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain,btohqsg
There's no need to be hero in the JC system all of them are losers no matter what,btohqsg
Bonus points if you kill that Uwu Uwu Bird,btohqsg
I fear no man. But that thing  it scares me.,btohqsg
Bruh as usual RP is the forgotten child,btohqsg

U think NYP is any better meh?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in lib cca but yet I hardly go to the lib,btohqsg
The heck is a library cca,btohqsg
y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have meh. even np oso have,btohqsg

RPs library barely even has books persay,btohqsg
Atp I‚Äôve been to the lib more than u ys,btohqsg

U transfer me 100 dollars and I will give you 200,btohqsg
Bro u looking at what time frame arh? If u zoom out u will find only pain for PLTR,btohqsg
I am surprised RP even has uses for lecture theatres,btohqsg
i wonder what they are used for most of the time,btohqsg
since lessons are conducted in classrooms,btohqsg
Yeah they aren't used for anything it's mainly just events and that only.. that's why I said I am surprised it was even remembered to exist,btohqsg
Eh this one is the W2 one rite?,btohqsg
they should use it more oftenbut judging from rp's learning method of teamwork for every module its unlikely they'll use it often.,btohqsg
For what tho? The whole point of RP defeats the purpose of a lecture theatre,btohqsg
You attend for what? LOA not even granted for those,btohqsg
Fruitful day so far? I presume,btohqsg
U got join IG or not?,btohqsg
Eh can spare me your Netflix password?,btohqsg

@chemcerI still waiting for you to pick up my parcel :(,btohqsg
im waiting for you to pick up mine :(,btohqsg
Ikr bedok flaked on both of us :(,btohqsg
it is 4min after the start of our death but,btohqsg
well maybe because we have power outtage so we spared üóø,btohqsg
@chemcerI still waiting for you to ord,btohqsg
Now even the disabled get to experience a roller coaster,btohqsg
Wait till you see the useless escalators,btohqsg
BRO PC LAST TIME DURING SBA TOOK 20MIN TO CHECK EACH BUNK,btohqsg
HE ONLY TOOK LIKE A MINUTE TO CHECK OUR BUNK FOR SBB,btohqsg
other than a speck of dust,btohqsg
bro i thought last week somehow major fk up but,btohqsg
can't wait to see MRF on the screen,btohqsg
i still have all my duffel bag and field pack and all,btohqsg
i didn't go for chemical defence,btohqsg
ok then i see plt medic or,btohqsg
Who's gonna stop me? You? I tot u still in camp?,btohqsg
Limpeh just go down to macdonalds to order whatever I Want instead,btohqsg
Who needs it to be free if u earn a decent amount,btohqsg
Watching Bedok get mad is like watching a Midget trying to attack someone,btohqsg
I have no idea what the fuck are u saying,btohqsg
Did she design this in a small space?,btohqsg
Type back: I am not getting paid for this shit I do it at whatever speed I want,btohqsg
Walao u remember the number as if it's your parents number like that,btohqsg
they make us say everyday for 3 months,btohqsg
i got fked damn badly by some fking spec bc i forgot the medic pledge,btohqsg
then he make me say in front of the entire batch (i still didnt rmb),btohqsg
forget liao sth sth save sth sth serve,btohqsg
‚Äúhi im a medic from the saf‚Äù ur lanjiao la,btohqsg
ppl heat injury how to d spine,btohqsg
nono must ‚Äúhello im a medic from the saf im here to help‚Äù first,btohqsg
if not according to the specs,btohqsg
they will be alarmed and refuse help,btohqsg
but then again i cosplay medic only what do i know,btohqsg
Bro u know from personal experience isit,btohqsg
when real code blue i stand back and let the 12 doctors at krhh handle i go watch my show,btohqsg
Hear the sick crunches of the ribs,btohqsg
550-12 ain't gonna make a difference,btohqsg
im p sure id be in their way either way,btohqsg
U still got 550 more days what,btohqsg
no wonder our SBA was lenient as fk,btohqsg
bro lucky i LD for today and tmrw,btohqsg
Cuz CPR as a human is tiring af especially after 5 mins,btohqsg
on second thought i kinda want to join the marching contingent,btohqsg
They do but why don't u just use the machine .,btohqsg
Frees up extra manpower to do an iv or smth,btohqsg
Cuz its the same saf that spend millions on the F-35,btohqsg
And the same one that uses 4-5% of our Budget,btohqsg
If so tho why would u have 12 ppl on standby,btohqsg
Exactly after 3-4 mins I wanna die liao,btohqsg
damn smo rly more approachable now,btohqsg
If u were every hospitalised you would know that's true.. on morning rounds be like eh doctor my head pain..I received the panadol at 6pm,btohqsg
That's not the worse bro.. the worse is when a med student wakes you up at 4am to read your vitals,btohqsg
Ah yes the homeless should just live in houses,btohqsg
Yes I know.. I also know to give them the wrong info so they would look like an idiot when their attending comes for morning rounds,btohqsg
Na bro if they weren't scolded for that they would be scolded for just another thing instead,btohqsg
One attending was going into a tirade on a House Officer about how the tendon hammer was a separate instrument and how the use of a stethoscope would be unable to test deep tendon reflexes on it,btohqsg
i don't get the joke eh,btohqsg
Humless.. blood cockles are added into char kuay teow.. its also a play on words cuz Humless and Harmless,btohqsg
I could tell the latter but i didn't understand what it has anything to do with the food...,btohqsg
ah makes sense. no wonder i couldnt tell,btohqsg
Hum is a colloquial term for Blood Cockles,btohqsg
yeah ive no idea what blood cockles mean,btohqsg
It's a type of shell fish similar to clams,btohqsg
OHHHHbut i didnt know why they were all saying hum and all of that stuffso probably had something to do with the post,btohqsg
wow  my bad for asking so much questionsi really don't know lots of stuff :'),btohqsg
Na the comments section is just NSFs making a joke about their own situation,btohqsg
Or themselves it's kinda the same thing,btohqsg
lol typical comment section on social media thatsnottwitter,btohqsg
Na it's fine I just find it incumbent upon me to ascertain as to what your background is whereby you didn't understand common parlance in regards to Singaporean food in general.,btohqsg
I am unable to even read the comments section as I do not possess a Instagram account,btohqsg
i mean singaporean food is goodand no im not a foreigner im actually a singaporeanmaybe im not aware of the sg related memes/jokes here  thats why...,btohqsg
Ngl ah i feel my friends are not as extroverted or as close as other friend groups,btohqsg
They dont want to go overseas or clubbing or anything like that. At most is movie or eat outside,btohqsg
or it feels like they have closer friend groups,btohqsg
maybe lazy to go out? or their schedule is busy,btohqsg
while all I have is them,btohqsg
Perhaps my sentence might seem sesquipedalian in nature but I merely am simply expressing my inquisitive nature due to the ubiquitous use of a large variety of such words in our everyday life's whereby a normal Singaporean with a decent aptitude for interaction would be exposed to such vocabulary,btohqsg
sesquipedalianA1 for o level english üíØim willing to bet my life,btohqsg
oh damnwell my english is awfulso clearly im not that exposed,btohqsg
I got a C6 for my English  hang on just a moment while I reset my language and typing style to something a little more layman,btohqsg
looks like i need to diesince i said im betting my life,btohqsg
Ah OK this one just means u everyday walk around u order kopi c gao kosong also need to get such vocab one what,btohqsg
How do you have so much energy,btohqsg
I go to the auntie ask to Cook me char kuay teow without Hum the auntie immediately understand one,btohqsg
Huh? What u mean by so much energy typing require a lot of energy meh?,btohqsg
yup they ask me if I want that thing in laksa,btohqsg
damn you found me on discord,btohqsg
Ya la Laksa also use Hum for flavour limpeh prefer to eat it blanch and serve as is with lime cuz its that delicious,btohqsg
But hearsay can kena Hepatitis from such things one so limpeh a bit scared la if u see the auntie the food hygiene macam cmi then don't order,btohqsg
maybe i should start using google,btohqsg
holy shit why did i take so long to realize what that was,btohqsg
It's liver got tachi so Inflame lor cuz trying to tell u got problem,btohqsg
my mess hall laksa during bmt sedap,btohqsg
yea i heard my parents say eating that too much is awful for your health,btohqsg
I tried to order with extra Hum before its a 50/50 coin flip one depending on if the auntie happy then u can get it if not you get told to fuck off,btohqsg
so if i were to buy laksa again ill probably not ask for that,btohqsg
or extra then they give only 1...,btohqsg
Not really it's merely a reflect of what blood cockles is.. a shellfish which by naturally harbours a large array of parasites and bacteria,btohqsg
the time i bought char siew rice  extra $2 for roasted chicken  auntie only gave 4 small piecesüò´,btohqsg
Some is if u ask extra they minus from you arh anyways I suspects its a reflection of current market price,btohqsg
Cuz the price of Hum increasing more than game stop in 2021,btohqsg
ohh does it live in mud or somethingbecause why would it be so infested,btohqsg
All shell fishes live in the mud.. they are filter feeders.. picture where would one get a clam,btohqsg
no wonder i remember my parents mentioning that,btohqsg
But like sushi it always depends on where u get it from.,btohqsg
oh yeah that toosince it's raw seafood,btohqsg
like fast foodcan eat but don't eat too much,btohqsg
Well then you would have to define what is a right amount especially for relatively innoculous and ubiquitous consumables,btohqsg
Btw I can go back to formal English rite?,btohqsg
Great just indulge me while i engaged in the floccinaucinihilipilificacious use of the English Language for it is iniquitous to deny a person with such a fundamental right of speech and as an extent one of a right of passage.,btohqsg
potassium cyanide that a lot of people used to suicide,btohqsg
For example one would have to consume a rather large amount of water for it to be lethal to the biology of a human body,btohqsg
common knowledge that apple seeds are poisonous  although only if you bite and swallow it then it would be an issueif you don't bite it but just swallow it it'll just be passed as waste,btohqsg
man my moms always saying that i drink wayyyy too much water for my bodylike i literally chucked 700ml of water after jogging when i reach home every weekend,btohqsg
Actually there is a cool trick one could do. If u actually open up apple seeds and smell the core of said seed  it would smell similar to almonds similar to the smell of almond paste or the concoction used in Almond desserts,btohqsg
‚Äúwater bucket‚Äù new nickname for me,btohqsg
oh nois it laced with cyanide,btohqsg
Well pure hydrogen cyanide doesn't its mainly cuz of the benzyldehye that provides such a smell,btohqsg
Na I recently attended a concert and like all Singaporeans do  I had to queue for a very wide array of events  but basically I bought a 1.5L bottle of water afterwards and took it down in one glup,btohqsg
now almonds all of a sudden sounds so dangerouseven though my parents told me that they were beneficial for health if i ate them,btohqsg
wonder what he‚Äôs typing ü§îwhy so long,btohqsg
You have to be very careful as to telling people that cyanide smells like almonds. As mostly could also only associate it with sweet almonds which have little to no cyanide content  hence I only gave an indicative product which I think closely mimics that smell.. it is honestly a very chemical smell either ways,btohqsg
because i literally remember that eva braun killed herself by biting on potassium cyanideand when people went to the room where she and hitler died they said her body spelled of almonds,btohqsg
bitter almonds like what you said,btohqsg
It is similar to how when you where told as a Secondary 1 kid how Aqeous Ammonia would smell like hear rotten eggs etc but then when one actually inhales it it very much is a chemically smell that overpowers everything,btohqsg
Well Hitler didn't have that distinction because he was so paranoid as to getting captured that he bit on the ampoule and shot himself in the head simultaneously,btohqsg
oh and also apparently he didn't trust the cyanide capsule so he literally tested it on blondi,btohqsg
Yes he did.. to be fair I don't understand why he wanted to test if cyanide works after all he already tried it on 7 million jews,btohqsg
after killing so many people he's still not sure if it works,btohqsg

Vodka is the most neutral sprit one can get so u won't really taste anything other than coke,btohqsg
