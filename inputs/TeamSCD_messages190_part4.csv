List price does not equal transacted price- Confucius,btohqsg
soft top is lighter! no need worry about motors and gears also,btohqsg
the 17k depre one also soft top but auto,btohqsg
I sold c200 at 21k depre,btohqsg
I think u forgotten that the market for auto is much larger than manualâ€¦.,btohqsg
But left 1 year only. So easy sell,btohqsg
Unless manual mx5 is super rare,btohqsg
Wsit till my car left 1 year you guys help me sell,btohqsg
Ok then probs can higher. But has an auto mx5 transacted at 17k before,btohqsg
That roi has up his sleeve,btohqsg
Or is that just a bs,btohqsg
I think highest recorded is 14k,btohqsg
1 manual one in market 13.9k depre mx5,btohqsg
Then that price is about as useful as 488k for ae86,btohqsg
I think that one listed for quite awhile,btohqsg
Idk  I never check mx5 market,btohqsg
Then i think in reality u are looking at 12-13k,btohqsg
