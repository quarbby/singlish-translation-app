What do you mean by this?Add citi rewards to amaze and use amaze however way you want.,btohqsg
You won't know what MAS will dictate as financial advice.,btohqsg
Yeah correct via tap on physical card or use apple pay for payment using amaze card.I am waiting for citi reward card as I just got amaze card today,btohqsg
Must be representing an regulated entity. Basically FA.,btohqsg
Meaning financial influencers have to select one of the many regulated entities and take the papers to be licensed?,btohqsg
Hihi  I have a DBS Women's world card. Does anyone know how I can convert my points to miles in the app?,btohqsg
But every video Chris got say this not financial advise but take it as financial entertainment. Like that still need to be regulated?,btohqsg
anyone knows how is gxs 0.9% calculated? need to hold for 3 months then get 0.9% on top of daily 2.38% right?,btohqsg
UserAbigailhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:irrelavent link,btohqsg
Amaze +citireward or krisflyerCan earn miles by taking bus?,btohqsg
Have anyone tried this and it works??,btohqsg
just tried 10mins ago immediate transfer,btohqsg
Hi all  just to confirm I will get 4mpd/ 5mpd for using uob VS/ dbs altitude to pay for rental vehicles in NZ? I have 2 vehicle rental for 2 different legs of the trip so will use two different cards to pay for each,btohqsg
It should work. Make sure you hit 1k for both.,btohqsg
Yes thanks! One is close to $2k and the other is a motorhome and exceed $2k in fact so I will use dbs altitude for that,btohqsg
#dpticketmaster seems to support atome now. Good way to stretch your money for more. üòÜHsbc revo lives on for another 3 months.,btohqsg
Have 10 K USD in my DBS USD account that I wanna deposit into SYFE USD Cash management account  how shall I proceed ( Syfe uses HSBC   I also have HSBC ACCOUNT)DBS USD- MY HSBC USD- Syfe HSBCDBS USD- DBS SGD- SYFE HSBCSeems very hard to transfer USD to USD   I even transfered my SEK from Sweden to USD Via Revolut then to DBS USD to avoid DBS bad remittance rate of the multicurrwncy account,btohqsg
My turn to kenna scam transaction. Luckily I‚Äôm always on amaze empty wallet ready to test mcc!,btohqsg
Amaze sometimes send otp via sms and email to proceed transaction. Do you receive it?,btohqsg
Does it mean u can transfer usd from dbs to HSBC via sfye withouy incur any fee?,btohqsg
is it now the SCB smart can cancel already??,btohqsg
Still can use till next year march. Then cancel. üòÅ,btohqsg
4% till March 2025 for under 800$ spend. Not 6% but not too bad. After that no more 4% then cancel.https://t.me/HMSGHive/2081,btohqsg
Total useless card after dec. Where got not bad. It is bonus cat 4% under 800. Might as well go for other card like maybank fnf. Or the new dcs flex card.,btohqsg
I think you are a bit harsh. It's still 4% (drop from 6%) no min spend from Dec to march. Maybank fnf 8% still needs 800$ spend.But yes  after that  it's useless.,btohqsg
DCS Flex can use CardUp to fulfill $416.67 of online spending. CB 6%-1.85%Then contactless transaction for entire month just need a modest $183.33 to fulfil min $600 spend. Still get 6% CB. Imo even better than 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
No. Scammers using the add to Uber trick. (No OTP required). Then upon successfully added they will make a transport / food purchase,btohqsg
4% for such transactions which other cards can get higher‚Ä¶ a bit sad I feel. üòì,btohqsg
its main selling point is no min spend. When SC axes that  to the bin it goes.,btohqsg
Call me cynical or snarky.But if u are unable to hit min spend. How can u hit the minimum block within a reasonable time frame.,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
I m stuck in the first step lol,btohqsg
I have the same thoughts that the person‚Äôs credentials were compromised  and perhaps credential reuse too across all his accounts  which suggests allowing the hackers to access his bank accounts.One thing giga could have done better was to only allow installation on new device after the old eSIM is removed from old device  like how GOMO and MyRepublic does it. The current way seems to deactivate the old eSIM upon activation of new eSIM.,btohqsg
Hi guys . Just to check if book agoda and use atome . Can I still earn the 4mpd for hsbc revo or citi rewards ?,btohqsg
Hi  may i know if there is a way to check MCC for places in JB/MY?,btohqsg
Thank u . I checked heymax. It's say can. Mcc 5999 . So I think is can use n earn 4mpd right,btohqsg
Amaze + empty wallet (+a bit thick skin) works wonder.,btohqsg
That one was insane so didnt manage to get. This is m2m concert hahaha.,btohqsg
Oh m2m ah  yesterday already have liao. I got m2m for presale haha,btohqsg
Not all concert have atome option,btohqsg
Ya. I guess depends on concert organizer to choose.,btohqsg
