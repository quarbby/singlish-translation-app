For the UOB One AccountNeeds to spend $500 on credit card monthly  recurring insurance payments are excluded  what about recurring payment for utilities? As I can’t find it under the exclusion list.If don’t meet the $500 card spending monthly seems no point opening the account,btohqsg
Is there any way to bypass the 10k salary for the Citi prestige card ?,btohqsg
Insurance is eligible spend for One savings account bonus interest (via One debit card). Just not eligible for cashback minimum spend,btohqsg
UOB Lady set to Family category  can earn 6 miles per dollar on FairPrice app payment via credit card and/or Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Hey guys  super new to this.If there are minimum eg: (UOB Evol  $600)  does it mean i have to spend 600 every single month? or how does it actually work,btohqsg
Yes every month need spend $600 to get the cashback else $0,btohqsg
Right  if i dont  no penalty or any sorts?,btohqsg
You need to spend minimum of $600 each month to get the *bonus* cashback.What he said was totally false. You'll still get 0.3% base cashback if you don't hit the minimum spending.Unless you're using UOB One card  where the minimum monthly spent is based on tiers and if you don't hit the minimum cashback tier  you'll get $0 for the quarter.,btohqsg
Thanks gotchu  meaning i'll have to plan months where i'd most likely hit the 600 in that specific month ( online + contactless ),btohqsg
I might have overlooked the 0.3% but it quite negligible in some sense 😅 ~,btohqsg
Suggest to look at cards like HSBC revo if you are struggling to constantly hit the min spending,btohqsg
Already have it! Looking to upgrade my CC game,btohqsg
This is a fake account right?,btohqsg
Yes  very clear. No premium  not in this group  username wrong.,btohqsg
HSBC Revo exclude dental or medical,btohqsg
yup yup. you are right. previously I mistaken that any contactless payment will get 4mpd. Now i realised only contactless of certain MCCs (inclusion model) will get 4mpd.,btohqsg
It operates on a whitelist model. Need to check tnc,btohqsg
yup. i am using instarem and heymax to check MCC now,btohqsg
realised Swee Heng is 5814 and not 5642(Bakery),btohqsg
5814 still have hsbc revolution rebate.,btohqsg
heymax shows mcc 5462. how u realise 5814?,btohqsg
I charged to my Instarem card and see the MCC. this is accurateHeymax is community contribution. some data might not be accurate,btohqsg
oic. btw heymax is based on mcc from visa api. Guess mcc for mastercard is different from visa,btohqsg
oh visa api. my apologies. it is possible that visa and master have different MCC,btohqsg
maybe heymax should factor that in since they will recommend the best cc to use,btohqsg
Anyone tried withdrawing cash using Youtrip in Japan? Any transaction fees?,btohqsg
Hi gurus does online groceries shopping counts as family category in uob lady card,btohqsg

Do you guys still purchased NTUC gift card use Citi cash back $800 as Link points have been nerf ?As I’m NTUC member  I usually get 4% + 0.5% + 0.83% and now all gone,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone know how to convert Krispay miles to Krisflyer miles from the Kris+ app?I only saw the option converting the other way round. Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm thinking of getting an IPad Pro. Any ideas to get the most cashback and discounts? So far I can only think of getting a new credit card,btohqsg
Anyone got uob stash acct. I m wondering why i m not getting the bonus interest for oct n sep. Where can i check with? Tks for info.,btohqsg
Did you maintain monthly average balance (MAB) in Sep and Oct? You can check the on how much to deposit to maintain MAB if you did withdrawals on UOB TMRW.If you think you have maintained MAB  you can check with UOB CSO to check.Safest strategy for UOB Stash account is deposit and don't withdraw anything.,btohqsg
