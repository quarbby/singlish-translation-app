so stingy  choose a car to send for u,btohqsg
or take walker  ask to take trolley. help to push to your location,btohqsg
Should I choose 10 ft Lorry instead?,btohqsg
If u ask me  i say lorryNo way any llm car will send for uWeight is also another issue,btohqsg
Can i send washing machine via llm car?I think the driver saw my washing machineHe will chao kan me,btohqsg
Why LLM didn't ask the delivery man to compensate the lost package? Deduct money from the wallet.,btohqsg
This guy will be released in 12 months. Customers know the name of their lalamove deliveryman right?,btohqsg
Take picture n let us know the dimensions lo,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also lala driver  never intended to be stingy on which vehicle mode as I assume the 1.7m or 2.4m would have suffice,btohqsg
How can a washing machine fit in a car?,btohqsg
Fit this dryer in my car with seats folded down,btohqsg
Can fit is one thing.U order llm ask sedan car driver take and send to another place.Will the llm driver chao kan u not? So big and heavy,btohqsg
U willing to hurt ur back for a low car price...??Customers can be cheap but that doesn't mean we sacrifice our health for their cheapness...,btohqsg
This one I never go thru LLM. Ex LLM customer contacted me for alacart job,btohqsg
Can lift one person ah washing machine..?? U must be quite strong... üí™üí™üëçüëç,btohqsg
Dryer okay la‚Ä¶ washing machine never try before üòÖ,btohqsg
looks like will break my back if move alone haha,btohqsg
Did ur encounter complaints from LLM where u receive SMS saying the recipient complain of missing item 2 MTHS later ? I delivered successfully and the recipient received the item from me personally and now complain of missing item .,btohqsg
And LLM reserves the right to deduct my $. Wa biang  the recipient ate the cake already and now wants $ back,btohqsg
Tis kind no standard one. Trash,btohqsg
Very angry. How much did I make only? One delivery doesn't pay that much. And I have to pay so much for that cake,btohqsg
Always take photo of the goods with the door unit number for evidence and keep it for at least a year.,btohqsg
There should be a time limit for claims by customers,btohqsg
does anyone know if llm has insurance for lost or damaged packages  and what  if any  is the rider's liability?,btohqsg
Treat it as driver has to pay‚Ä¶ LLM never cover drivers,btohqsg
A year is a long time.LLM should set some limits on how long after a customer get his stuff  he can complain about issue. Cannot be 10 days after u make an order for delivery for a cake  den u realise u nv received the cake  or the cake is spoilt..After receiving any complain  it's reasonable to expect llm to approach the delivery guy  within 5 working days  to address the complain  like show picture as proof of delivery.To just deduct the $$ from the deliveryman's wallet is already wrong  as they are a middleman who should hear both side of the story.,btohqsg
So must be careful and take pics for evidence. Previously  kenna scammed. They never compensate nevermind. The trip $20. Only tell me can reimburse 25% after deducting LLM comm üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Treat it as pay school fees‚Ä¶ what to doü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
