We can get you the numbers. But let me say this. What is the point behind the question? First  has local unemployment increased with all these efforts? The answer is a resounding 'no'. Our people are getting good jobs. Are our wages going up? Yes  and it's faster than many other countries. Those are proof points to show that we are doing right by Singaporeans.,btohqsg

Nvm this is what I saw onlineDo you always lose muscle mass when you lose weight?For the most part  yes ‚Äì weight loss is comprised of the loss of¬†both¬†fat and muscle  says Melissa  so this research shouldn‚Äôt deter you from continuing or trying to fast. It‚Äôs a matter of minimizing muscle loss  rather than avoiding it.space-lineWhat causes people to lose more muscle than fat?Food:¬†It‚Äôs not just about fasting. It‚Äôs about the quality and quantity of what we eat  says Melissa. ‚ÄúLack of protein is a huge culprit when it comes to muscle loss. The body doesn‚Äôt store protein the same way it stores other nutrients  so  we have to eat it regularly. We can‚Äôt expect fasting to do all the work  if what we do consume isn‚Äôt well-balanced.‚ÄùSome may struggle to fit in a healthy amount of protein if their fasting window is too strict; a more lenient  longer window to space your protein out may be helpful  explains Melissa. ‚ÄúAdditionally  how much protein you need is key to keep in mind. Protein is notoriously overdone. It should only account for around 15-25 percent of our daily caloric intake.‚ÄùExercise (or lack thereof):¬†A sedentary lifestyle can also lead to muscle loss  adds Melissa. Strength-training  in addition to aerobic activity  is key to maintaining and building muscle.,btohqsg

It is too long for me to read,btohqsg
i mean generally weight loss affects both fat and muscle so it comes down to body composition and diet. reshaping your body to keep or grow muscle while losing fat means you gotta also exercise/train and eat enough protein,btohqsg
but you also need carbs to keep metabolism up,btohqsg
