I know some go and withdraw the bonus interest until account has exactly $100 000.00. So earmark will fail. Since you donâ€™t have 31 Dec + 100 000.00,btohqsg
Why would putting extactly $100k fail the earmark ?,btohqsg
Because 31 Dec day end would be $10 + base interest say $4.You need to have at least $100 014 at all times until earmark happens.Also do not forget. Earmark happens 1 month and 3 weeks+ after you register.Register on 1st jan. earmark is about 20th Feb. (Plus minus),btohqsg
Simple rule is to check dec statement  check the 31st dec end balance  lets say $x  ensure after u register that time  until your amount get earmarked and until after earmark period ends  never ever allow the balance to fall below $x + $100k.,btohqsg
Abit late to say this now though..  but anyway will serve as a lesson learnt for the next 1st April's promo  if there is one,btohqsg
I always have buffer for everything I do. Time and amount.,btohqsg
Then when can remove the base interest and one account interest?,btohqsg
After u see your balance  magically dropped 100k.,btohqsg
Actually it should be safe to withdraw exactly the bonus interest right?,btohqsg
Suppose if 31 Dec balance is already base 100k  can add 100k (for earmarking) now and come mid Apr then withdraw the 100k base ?.,btohqsg
Depends on how confident u are and how closely u track your account.If prone to make mistakes I would recommend only touch it when u see earmark already completed.Why risk the earmark process just because of $400 not earning any interest.For me personally I remove till $100 100.00. But later someone is going ask me why $100 100 and not $100 050.,btohqsg
Last call for transferring out. As of 10:15pm  FAST transfer still cleared today.,btohqsg
Base interest I suggest don't touch  bonus interest comes in after they take the amount  can use it as part of the 100k.,btohqsg
But even so  after withdraw already  u still need to make sure the earmark amount is above the 31st dec end balance + 100k,btohqsg
