Hmm what about considering skipping some stops during off peak hours? Like on the ccl some stops basically have no passengers going in or out during off peak hours,btohqsg
He also gave an interview in 2000 after he retired where he talked about being stonewalled,btohqsg
The harder part would be to request access la which is why I say u go national archives,btohqsg
still the same problem with trains that actually do stop at those stops  bunching and ultimately it wont be an express svc,btohqsg
the problem with this is as polka mentioned..bunching will easily occur,btohqsg
so in the end you got a whole mrt system full of jams,btohqsg
saved you to go to tmjc,btohqsg
I hate dsa players too  even though they are gd  but they just keep winning,btohqsg
Also Tony Tan made some very elitist comments to former senior minister of state Tay Eng Soon before he passed away. When Tay was seeking more funding for vocational institutes (ITE/poly) Tan reportedly told Tay “why throw money after bad rubbish?”. Tay Eng Soon did not tell anyone about this except his wife  and Tay’s wife then told his brother (Tay Kheng soon) about his remarks after Tay Eng Soon passed away.Side note  Tay Kheng soon is quite a renowned architect and was involved in designing some well known brutalist architecture structures in the 70s such as Golden Mile complex,btohqsg
It’s an understatement that they did not like him LOLAfter he passed away  when LKY was asked what he thought was OTC’s biggest contribution  he said that “His biggest accomplishment was being the NTUC secretary general”  LKY didn’t mention his presidency at all,btohqsg
This is why the pap still gave him a certain respect,btohqsg
OTC also wasn’t accorded a state funeral unlike other past presidents,btohqsg
He was given only a state assisted funeral and this was questioned by quite a few back then,btohqsg
At least he wasn't Devan Nair away,btohqsg
OTC spent 30-40 years as a city planner building up portion of singapore,btohqsg
U weren't surprised when I did it what is with this favouritism,btohqsg
Ya and ppl here will tell u to KNOCK IT DOWN and LIGHTS OUT,btohqsg
He was also involved in the conceptualization of changi airport..one of PAP's most amicable accomplishments in its whole history,btohqsg
Unfortunately history in jc doesn’t rly cover much about Singapore’s political side. H1 history talked a bit about Singapore but not much,btohqsg
But tbh if Tay Kheng soon had dropped the bombshell of those elitist remarks he made earlier before the 2011 presidential election  I think that Tony Tan would’ve lost to Dr Tan Cheng Bock,btohqsg
So? What is with this discrimination maybe I change major how tsk tsk tsk,btohqsg
cant forget this guy that served 1 yr between death of yusof ishak and appointment of benjamin sheares,btohqsg
Tbh I wonder what history would’ve been like TCB became president. Would have run for re election again? Or would he just step down and remain low key,btohqsg
Woah. I wish I could’ve seen T1 before the upgrade,btohqsg
I’m passionate about the past so I’m kind of sad I never got to live through the 80s,btohqsg
That era looked like such a fun time,btohqsg
It would have been funny for LKY to witness that,btohqsg
same ive been saying that for a long time here..for those that known me..they know i used to post old pics of sg,btohqsg
here..like great pics of sg in the 1970s-1980s or even 1990s in my opinion,btohqsg
Changi Airport T1 underwent major refurbishment works from2008-2012  and most of the old look was wiped out then,btohqsg
Ya it’s like 2 blows one after another. Losing the first grc  then the first govt endorsed candidate to lose the presidency,btohqsg
He’s much more likeable than TT,btohqsg
Too bad he told LHL he rather not run unless rly no one else wanted to,btohqsg
It was a shame thing tbh,btohqsg
idk why time passes so fast and im now y5 i swear i was y2 3 months ago and i swear that the end of y3 was yesterday,btohqsg
He’s too humble  I think with his stature he would’ve made a much better president and representing Singapore on the global stage,btohqsg
ngl if i can go back to a time in the past  it would be February 2023,btohqsg
gardens by the bay was 10 years old last year,btohqsg
At least you're still in the same sch after y4,btohqsg
Something that express stream students never get,btohqsg
I had a thinking in the last few days..Had LKY ever looked over the singapore he built? like from a high point,btohqsg
yea i found this pic of him,btohqsg
Imagine seeing the country you spent more than half your life building,btohqsg
Wah DBS building back then  and also that Malaysia Singapore airlines building (sadly demolished in the 90s),btohqsg
DBS building was sold to OUE and now looks unrecognisable after being heavily refurbished,btohqsg
Also I think Everton park is in the right background (top right) of the pic,btohqsg
view from a apt of the tearing down of pearl bank apartments,btohqsg
There’s some now demolished blocks along cantonment (near Everton park) that could be seen. Pinnacle Duxton now stands there,btohqsg
Actually indirectly…i would not hv qualified for jc if i did not dsa to my sec sch,btohqsg
I remembered how the conductor was 1m behind me..q scary,btohqsg
