Gold prices surged to $2 020 an ounce on Tuesday  the highest level since March of 2022  after fresh data for US job openings pointed to a slowdown in the labour market  suggesting the Fed may not need to raise rates much further and could even pause the tightening cycle. On Monday  the ISM Manufacturing PMI already pointed to a fifth straight month of contraction in factory activity  in a sign that tighter credit conditions are already hurting the economy. Investors now see a 56.9% probability the Fed will leave the fed funds rate steady next month. At the same time  the recent banking crises have led to a surge in demand for safe-haven assets.,btohqsg
