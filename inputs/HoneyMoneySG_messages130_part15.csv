Hi all  I have been using Citi Cash Back + Amaze overseas. Have no issue hitting the min. spend but I noticed that sometimes MCC for dining most especially is not eligible for bonus cashback (only know until after it is posted on Amaze). So I don‚Äôt know if I should keep using this card since not üíØ sure on the MCC overseasI am considering to switch to UOB Visa Signature but can‚Äôt pair with Amaze (is it worth the higher Fx?) or Maybank FnF + Amaze‚Ä¶Any advice? Thanks,btohqsg
You can always use empty amaze wallet to check MCC before you commit to the transaction.,btohqsg
For earning air miles which is better? UOB Krisflyer or UOB Prvi card for travel - hotel  flights & overseas meals. I use this for business travel expenses,btohqsg
Hello guys just starting out  would you all recommend trading with like OCBC / poems / DBS vickers (cdp account link) or brokerages like Tiger / moomoo / webull (custodian based)? (Trading both us and sg securities)Just curious what are your practices.Also  if custodian link brokerages  would you all go with moomoo / webull / tiger? (Am leaning to tiger since the custodian is more ‚Äúreliable‚Äù - DBS bank),btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows if I am able to bring myself + 3 other travellers to Priority Pass lounge  assuming I have 4 different cards that grant lounge access?,btohqsg
As long as they are regulated  just go with the one that you are most comfortable with the UI/UX. Remember to get the welcome gifts with referral links first,btohqsg
UOB KrisFlyer for higher earn rate if you meet the requirements,btohqsg
1 main + 1 guest per visit  unless it is under DBS Vantage PP,btohqsg
Oh  so must first access must always be the main cardholder? Or in another perspective  can I scan my PP app and let my relative in?,btohqsg
Yes and you will use 2 passes in this case,btohqsg
I see  as I was thinking if I have HSBC T1  HSBC Premier and Citi Prestige.. whether can bring more family members to lounge,btohqsg
Btw HSBC t1 uses dragonpass so u can't share w ur family members.,btohqsg
Yes u can. But u need to be physically present to sign your loved one in because the staff would verify your passport against your profile in PP app,btohqsg
Does my fellow traveller in this case clock as the guest or she can clock as the main?Example I use HSBC T1 to sign myself in  then I use Maybank VI to sign my spouse in?,btohqsg
Hey guys  I'm aware SCB Smart can earn Bonus points for YouTube Premium subscription. But I don't wish to sign just because of that. If I charge subscription to CRMC  does it constitute as online transaction?,btohqsg
