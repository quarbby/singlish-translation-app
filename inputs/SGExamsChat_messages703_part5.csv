would you say your As Econs is superb cause of prior Econs background like during Os,btohqsg
No mention of MP centred on exchange rate,btohqsg
It only gives a slight advantage,btohqsg
Like to you on a scale of 1-10 how slight is that advantage,btohqsg
Not as much as like a math student taking h2 math vs a student who took only e math but took h2 math,btohqsg
Actually some ppl will say barely too,btohqsg
So it's not insignificant but it's somewhat there ah,btohqsg
The 8 mark ‚Äúessay‚Äù qns for o level Econs if you write concisely it‚Äôs possible to get full credit with like 30-40 words in some cases,btohqsg
Even some of the answers which are not really using Econs technical terms correctly they accept,btohqsg
Wah I wonder if the writing style is diff from SS and hist,btohqsg
Cause from what I've heard there's some overlaps btw SS and hist in terms of the format? But not rlly,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so much easier than SS/history/geog,btohqsg
No wonder they dw offer it as part of a sub combi,btohqsg
Like geography LORMs they expect so much for 8 marks,btohqsg
like I rmb for my sch   neighbourhood sch ah idk is it cause of that that's why they don't offer or not enof manpower,btohqsg
I can find the mark scheme and send later,btohqsg
Uk a levels they don‚Äôt rly care about copyright so past year papers and answers can all be found online,btohqsg
it's my time to shine üòàüòà,btohqsg
I haven't seen actual As h1 Econ qns yet but i feel like the qns phrasing are at most weird and tricky,btohqsg
but once figured out it's all g?,btohqsg
Some h1 Econs qns can be very hard,btohqsg
Imma prob sound dumb but it can't be harder than H2 rite,btohqsg
as in harder than some of the H2 qns,btohqsg
I mean I‚Äôm talking about qns wise for csq,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just that the content is less so it may be easier in that respect,btohqsg
But less breadth doesn‚Äôt mean lower difficulty for each of the qns,btohqsg
Like some of the h1 Econs csq qns are harder than h2,btohqsg
Singapore women earned 14.3% less than men in 2023  according to MOM data.The gap has narrowed over last 5 years.https://str.sg/G6dN,btohqsg
does anyone here listen to ariana grande,btohqsg
Take a look at this 8 mark econs question lol. Legit just writing ‚ÄúHigh wages may increase cost of production  leading to inflation and lowering international competitiveness  decreasing exports. But workers may feel appreciated  motivating them to work harder  increasing demand for labour‚Äù can alr get full credit,btohqsg
It‚Äôs definitely not the best though,btohqsg
I just wanted to make fun of kuro,btohqsg
But I heard something like with the syllabus revision in 2020 where they changed it from 6 choose 3 qns to 4 choose 3 in paper 2  they added an evaluation component to make it harder to get full credit but it‚Äôs still very easy,btohqsg
Ok I just wasn‚Äôt sure if you heard of the bad stuff there also,btohqsg
I‚Äôve never been there before so whatever I‚Äôm typing is hearsay  but I‚Äôm quite sure most of them are true. Ever since they expanded they‚Äôve lowered the quality of the teachers who got in and some of them can‚Äôt teach properly. It also seems that students go there to socialise than to learn properly  like they offer a lot of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù to the point I think students are going there to get benefits from their parents money rather than to study lol. I‚Äôve heard a lot of mixed reviews.,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs what i thought too,btohqsg
Reddit also has ppl which talk badly about their experience in zenith,btohqsg
I think they focus highly on student welfare then students like wah 10% off this and that,btohqsg
Yeah lol. But I heard for Econs they managed to spot some of the essay qns last year,btohqsg
My Econs Cher was saying those tuition centres which spend a lot on welfare is some kind of moral hazard,btohqsg
I couldn‚Äôt draw the link based on what was taught in the Econs syllabus though,btohqsg
But anyway yeah it does sound wrong,btohqsg
Low key throwing shade on zenith,btohqsg
those are more of like socialising places as compared to actl tuition centres,btohqsg
they legit said they willing to give free airpods for students who join 1 class,btohqsg
not sure if i want to go tuition or not,btohqsg
cos idek which tuitions r reliable,btohqsg
later they teach wrong thing or the tcher not good,btohqsg
aiya better to ask school teachers la hor,btohqsg
Nah. They just call it paper 2. Like structured qns without extracts or preamble,btohqsg
