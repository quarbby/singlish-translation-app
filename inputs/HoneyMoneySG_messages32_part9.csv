Hi  if my insurance recurring credit payment only accept Mastercard.Â  So means I need to arrange to charge to Grab Master Card and setup Auto Top Up to Grab Master Card from Amex TCB if want to get Cashback and automate the process.Â  Any other suggestions?Â  I don't quite like this arrangement but guess with all the constraint  this is the only way?Â  Thanks.,btohqsg

Ok thanks.  I got mthly and annual.  Do you happened to know if applied with Singpass and they indicated no further doc required  how long they take to issue the card?  Or I can download their apps and know the card details straight away?  I got dued payment so wonder how to get the details asap. ðŸ˜….  Also  does Amex waive annual fees? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
18 months can consider BOC for 3.7% if not 24 months can consider RHB for 3.9%,btohqsg
Quite fast. I got approval and received the card around the same time  about 8 days after application. Don't think you can make payments before that because the card needs to be activated first. Yes annual fee can be waived.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI rewatched your cpf video. May I ask for vc3A  if MA maxed  FRS reached in SA  is the amount for vc3A will all go to OA earning the poor 2.5% in today's interest rate context?,btohqsg
Maybe you can break your amount into two 12mths or shorter tenure FD with 2 banks instead bec the 18mths or 24mth FD rates are lower than 12mths FD as some banks are of the view of falling interest rate.Like ocbc there is the 3.88% for 8mths or 4.08% for 8mths for 360acc.Unless ur intentions is don't mind the smaller int rate and wan to lock it in first with the view of falling rates.,btohqsg
