I mean if all 3 options are within poly then just focus on doing well first,btohqsg
You might feel differently after the sem,btohqsg
I can't focus on doing well if it's alr been done,btohqsg
yeah that's wat my papa said,btohqsg
I mean what are your factors swaying you from those choices,btohqsg

Biomed tough I scored 7 points of na n levels to sp biomed couldn't get in,btohqsg
if you not sure means got pull and push factors right,btohqsg
Then I go sec5 see this time can anot if cannot I going jc lor anyways I took SBB Chinese and English in 4n,btohqsg
uh 1 - staying : don't feel very much interested  like i wouldn't do it for a lifetime la tbh   and it's very media  I usually take media as a hobby rather than serious  although there's some biz aspects to it.. because und biz sch  I feel like I don't see myself sitting in office working a 9-5 job and also degree.. idt I wld pursue a degree is biz,btohqsg
what’s the poly course for eae,btohqsg
I mean o level and n level diff pts ah but like aerospace is max 18,btohqsg
For na right all poly courses have no cut off point,btohqsg
yea that’s the thing like a hobby is very different from what you see yourself doing for a career  esp when you sit down and start learning all the details. It kinda turns a lot of people off,btohqsg
Ok for na n level to poly right I have a rough estimate5 to 6 points (biomed)7 to 9 points (popular courses)Tp psy law etc etcBizness all polys10 to 13 pointsEngineeringOther non popular coursesFor your reference,btohqsg
I tot only below 8 LAWLS,btohqsg
feel like 1 is not a good option just cos of what you said,btohqsg
💀💀 trying my best to get out of eae exercise rn,btohqsg
I tot must complete one year,btohqsg
but is it sure that I can appeal out of my course after 1 sem,btohqsg
which poly kids can i askrawr but 🐯,btohqsg
my friend went from business in poly to physics uni,btohqsg
no la just my own thing,btohqsg
you alr more wise than like so many people,btohqsg
Is jc pain worth it tho 💀,btohqsg
I dk why but I feel damn offended by this,btohqsg
Cuz man....you don't have to be from the top tier na sec school to do well for sec5-,btohqsg
I have a psle of 150+++,btohqsg
But I made it to na to JC,btohqsg
ya u then meme la kuro,btohqsg
It is more of the effort you put in,btohqsg
psle is a horrible measure of how far you’ll go,btohqsg
After all  all sch are good sch,btohqsg
I just got this on YouTube shorts. Feel like it’s for Bedok,btohqsg
"Worst thing is that people during that stage like p6 chers all always say ""most important exam ever""",btohqsg
wrong reco page give it to bedok,btohqsg
They aren’t wrong in that at psle you are immediately thrown into these streams,btohqsg
when a lot of people are still developing their learning capability,btohqsg
mine was everyone self motivated rich for tuition so teachers q chill,btohqsg
How does the new system work anyway,btohqsg
"Mhmm then O level people also say ""most important""Then a level also most important",btohqsg
No RP is 6 can cfm,btohqsg
I got a 263 for psle but based on how I worked then I had no business going express,btohqsg
psle: 1. u do well go ip go jc  but if u wanna go poly because you know you're not someone who can consistently put it crazy smt of work for 6 years  then  gg your left w no certyou do badly; you're put into your respective streams and then get categorised  the 'worse' you are  the harder to proceed on to better tertiary education. it makes sense it a sense that they want to level out the ability of all students  but does this give all students a chance to pursue what they actually want? if not what? private. Not everyone has money,btohqsg
Yes cuz one of my friends got 6 and he got rp,btohqsg
ya fr but whh u never go ip,btohqsg
Den ?? u say express semo,btohqsg
my point is that I shouldn’t have even qualified,btohqsg
I remembered working hard for psle.. (copying answer sheet),btohqsg
also  I might not have even made it to JC if it wasn’t for IP,btohqsg
was damn tough you know  always had to hide from my mother,btohqsg
my mum describes her three kids like this,btohqsg
btw what's the min to cont ip ..,btohqsg
My brother: steal answer sheetMy sister: do the work properly and mark herselfMe: too lazy to even bother stealing answers,btohqsg
I js feel like as much there is ITE and all.. some fields are not as accepting of students with certain certs,btohqsg
idk how my mum was so chill with it tho,btohqsg
like she let me watch tv during psle period,btohqsg
and I rmb only reading the science book out of pure interest,btohqsg
my friend went for MOE scholarship interview got asked what changes he’d make to the PSLE system,btohqsg
Idk I just applied to the sch and it auto puts you in IP unless you choose to go o levels after sec 2 or your grades cmi like below 3 I think,btohqsg
Oh that was a while ago. He contracting at a sch now,btohqsg
Continue? Mine was average gpa 3.0 (60%) for 6 subs with minimum 2.5 (55%) for math and English,btohqsg
I mean sure there is ITE and all  idt the problem lies in the education system  but it's the people who interview fresh grads.. imagine they get a 50 year old to interview a fresh grad who has great skills but let's just say prolly js a dip or ite cert  they wouldn't understand how skills are valued    and like as much as our edu system is improving  it's companies how are at fault not being able to accept the newer gen way of learning,btohqsg
so it's js 3.0 ah basically,btohqsg
oh then my brother is fine why is he stressed DAFUQ,btohqsg
It varies from school to school   e..g some school 3.0 is higher or lower %Then some school 4.0 also higher or lower %It variesAnd some school varies GPA like 3.0 3.5 4.0Some 3.0 3.2 3.4Blah blahDepends,btohqsg
yk my grammar doesn't make sense but the idea is being put across and that's all that matters rn bcz I am not ok iw to slp,btohqsg
I used to get GPA 0 for chem lol   verge of retaining 💀,btohqsg
Public perception is that Anything that isn’t express -> JC -> Uni (in STEM or like business) is inferior,btohqsg
At least people more accepting of poly now,btohqsg
end of day  also lies on the human and our ever changing world  diploma used to be q hireable  sure there's internship but wld they choose a dip kid or degree. who knows as I study in uni  Bach is needed for basic application 😀😀😀 i wil literalky kms,btohqsg
anything that isn’t SMU NTU or NUS also will look down,btohqsg
so far I've only heard of dorector list kids only which is like 10-15,btohqsg
the reality is that in many cases to employers  Uni cert is more about demonstrating higher capability of learning,btohqsg
You know my concern about career is directly opposite,btohqsg
being overqualified is a real thing,btohqsg
But like lowkey...sign on... not bad 💀,btohqsg
we have si Yan n kuro talking to each other the complete opposites,btohqsg
Spf sign on no need tekong right,btohqsg
wat happen to burette mindset bruh,btohqsg
I meannn the odds of landing the job I want as a professor is like <<10% but most jobs don’t require a PhD,btohqsg
And there’s quite a few stigmas surrounding a PhD,btohqsg
fr fr 🙏 one like one prayer,btohqsg
well  over qualified is better than under qualified no??,btohqsg
wait can u not apply a normal job as a PhD,btohqsg
u better be kidding there were tears alr,btohqsg
no I'm only 4 go in,btohqsg
but is it not better than ntg,btohqsg
Too specialised for the industry/company sth sth right? I heard a bit,btohqsg
never my life I wanna get a PhD so like this is fresh ya,btohqsg
ok good pt but I only care for myself so 🙏 HAHAH JK,btohqsg
Yea a few things like 1) only know your field dk anything else that’s industry relevant or no skills 2) only know books cannot work in a company 3) problems given to you are “too easy” and you’ll quit soon,btohqsg
even if you willing to settle,btohqsg
they think you’re just there for a short while until you find a good deal,btohqsg
my father was telling me abt it   this guy go Cambridge and all now he's only manager,btohqsg
who wants an employee that’s there for a short time,btohqsg
so the best move for me is simultaneously pursue my PhD will getting industry experience and skills on the side,btohqsg
ykw just go be like junwei make ur own book,btohqsg
I know some of my seniors that grad alr right,btohqsg
they get immediately rejected for many bachelors level jobs,btohqsg
above or lower has its own issues,btohqsg
masters still ok actually is like a bachelors++,btohqsg
