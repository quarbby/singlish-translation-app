Good morning. Today super hot pls stay hydrated! ❤️  Chloe,btohqsg
Hi Chloe dont mind my wheel gap🤭,btohqsg
Its okay you can post your bike,btohqsg
Thats not a wheel gap thats a wheel canyon,btohqsg
But we still love u sweetie,btohqsg
@roincecgot free time to go put the gap line?🤣,btohqsg
U ownself asking for it sia hahaha,btohqsg
Thats the spare tyre storage space. When tyre punctures he will have the last laugh,btohqsg
U r supposed to help us bully him what u doing,btohqsg
Even my stock suspension still lower then ur 🤣😂,btohqsg
I think its just honda stock things,btohqsg
What happens if u do both,btohqsg
Springs go over your stock damper,btohqsg
Coil is a full set by itself,btohqsg
Ahh so that means it will not have any issue within themselves?,btohqsg
Coilovers are already a full assembly that is adjustable,btohqsg
Lowering springs replace your stock springs but u keep your damper,btohqsg
It depends on what u want ultimately,btohqsg
Lowering springs are cost effective aesthetic change but directly translates to a harsher ride,btohqsg
Because u just effectively used back a stock damper and now your travel is shorter,btohqsg
The damper is not optimized for that set up,btohqsg
Hence it will damage ur damper,btohqsg
Coils are the so called “proper” way to do it,btohqsg
Since it comes with mounts and dampers that were meant for it,btohqsg
Or u can do the opposite of what ppl do,btohqsg
And change the damper and roll like a conti,btohqsg
guys  the IU only can do at vicom right?,btohqsg
sad they all no open today. my iu suddenly just died,btohqsg
Nt sure but carousell can find ws doing if u urgent,btohqsg
thanks bro  will go check. cuz tmr like a bit no time to go do then cannot enter carpark sibei mafan hahahah,btohqsg
Just press the help button and explain. 1x they sure open ba,btohqsg
I tried before cashcard no $$ hahah they let me out 😂,btohqsg

press the intercom 3x then got people talk to me stuck there 10mins,btohqsg
Lol.Mine died too about 3 months back. During the a long weekend holiday somemore.,btohqsg
Hope just fuse blow. If not you gotta spend money for replacement,btohqsg
fuse/wiring is either free or low cost to repair hor? replacement $155. shag,btohqsg
Yup. Mine was fuse blown. $5 plus iirc.,btohqsg
Replacement of entire iu $155 excluding gst,btohqsg
when fuse blown the thing is totally non responsive right?,btohqsg
That’s what I encountered. Totally no detection. As if it was not connected at all.,btohqsg
I went down to vicom quite early when it opens. I clearly remember. Once first in line. Lol,btohqsg
i see bro  same as mine now lor.,btohqsg
Buy a used one install then go inspection centre register save you more money,btohqsg
lucky i stay near yishun vicom. maybe tmr try 8am reach then rush to work liao. the process of repair/replacement will take how long ah?,btohqsg
Just prepare cash card put at the side door. And be prepared to go very close to the cashcard machine because Will need to call intercom for hdb season Parkers,btohqsg
buy from carousell ah? jn i saw some listings $38 only hahahha. need bring to inspection center to install n register right?,btohqsg
Yeah  say they open at 8am  be there at 745am. I kiasu haha,btohqsg
just hope when i exit carpark at 7:30am no people behind me 🤣,btohqsg
Make sure they give you the excuse sheet!,btohqsg
Hahahah. No issue lah. Iu down understandable. I also don’t know why I happened to me that time. Go out for dinner  come home spoil already,btohqsg
Oo if any ws can.. used ones quite cheap,btohqsg
Never add any funny electronics somemore,btohqsg
yah man  exact same thing happened to me. just suddenly died,btohqsg
ooh ok thanks man  cuz my car left 1+ year nia don't think got a point to get a new iu also,btohqsg

Morning all..Have a wonderful day n week ahead😊,btohqsg
Hi frens if ERP never deduct cos card error  how do I go pay it? Or wait for letter first?,btohqsg
Check axs app after 3 days,btohqsg
Then pay thru the app or machine,btohqsg
Erp error can appeal... I remember my cousin did before.,btohqsg
But I remember him telling me something about erp reader not working properly then could appeal. But after that had to get replacement,btohqsg
It depends on what the letter say. My company lorry they bochap,btohqsg
They just say they detected an error,btohqsg
Time to wrap it with something they hate,btohqsg
Maybe I wait letter? Won’t penalty right?,btohqsg
Cos AXS also got admin fee,btohqsg
At most just pay 8 dollar fine on top of what the erp was,btohqsg
Hope is just 1 fine cos I tio 2 erp in a row,btohqsg
The most is pay late fee,btohqsg
$10 admin fee + erp fee,btohqsg
10 is if u go down pay at axs  if pay online 8,btohqsg
I did use roof cover last time,btohqsg
But the cat still sleeps on it,btohqsg
I got lazy to out the cover on after awhile,btohqsg
Use this app to prevent cashcard no money or error. Gt cashcard will deduct card. Dont have will deduct from ur app.,btohqsg
But ur IU spoil will still deduct meh,btohqsg
