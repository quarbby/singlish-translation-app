On 29 Sept 2023  I went onvisa.com.sgto enquired S$1 = how much Yen.The exchange rate calculator displayed S$1 = Yen 109.721188Immediately  I withdrawn Yen6000 wz TRUST card in JAPAN wz S$55.28 deducted from my savings account.This conversion rate came up to S$1 = Yen 108.53835  a difference of 1% less.TRUST CSO subsequently highlighted I should have enquired ‚ÄúYen to SGD‚Äù onvisa.com.sgsince withdrawing in Japan  instead of ‚ÄúSGD to Yen‚Äù.I cannot wrap my head around the order of the enquiry:‚ÄúYen to SGD‚Äù vs ‚ÄúSGD to Yen‚Äù.Does the TRUST CSO make sense??,btohqsg
yes. there is a difference.YEN to SGD means you are selling YEN and buying SGD.SGD to yean means the reverse.Trust / visa/  any entity will have different rates  because in one case they are buying yen from you and in another they are selling yen to you.the difference in the rate is their spread or margin or how-they-make-money,btohqsg
"the visa and mc currency converter sites are used to answer the question:I spent this amount in X currency (JPY)  how much will it cost me in Y currency (SGD)so the first currency you enter always needs to be the currency you're spending.the visa converter page also has a tooltip that says ""Select the currency of the transaction and then the currency for conversion."" which clarifies the order",btohqsg

may i know which crypto exchange u gurus used,btohqsg
points on each citibank card is separate,btohqsg
Do u know when will I see cashbacj,btohqsg
your quarter should be Aug to Oct  will get rebate end of Nov statement,btohqsg

yes  i have a payment for 2k  can be made via favepay QR  but visa signature only accepts contactless and not online  so verifying if favepay QR considers online or contactless üòÖ,btohqsg
not too sure  maybe u want to wait for other to confirm.,btohqsg

If it is education mcc it will stay as it even if u use amaze and now amaze charge u 1 percent for education mcc. End result is u dont get any rebate from sc simply cash and u get charge 1 percent by amaze.,btohqsg
Will UoB lady exclude amaze from 6mpd? Mcc fit to the selected category,btohqsg
If your education can pay amex then go for uob absolute amex for 1.7 percent or amex true cashback for 1.5 percent,btohqsg
Nope  uob have not excluded amaze* retail transaction yet,btohqsg
Another way is use any credit card ( dont get any rebate)  giro spending to hsbc ega to get 1 percent if u fulfill criteria,btohqsg
If grab mastercard can by use  then uob absolute amex to grab (0.3 percent)  giro uob amex to hsbc ega (1 percent). Total 1.3 percent back,btohqsg
But does UOB Lady gives any benefits in Online transactions?,btohqsg
Nope it is mcc specific for the bonus cat u choose. Online or offline doesnt matter,btohqsg

What done cant be undone. Dont know what you mean by trying to smoke with them.,btohqsg
Lol I also told you yesterday that amaze will retain original mcc. Too bad lor  next year/ whenever your next bill is  use the methods Queenie suggested,btohqsg
Dec 23  1st will get another 1% from Everyday+,btohqsg
yeah  dats my understanding too. Therefore I see little benefit for pairing UOB Lady with Amaze  except for the 0.5% to 1% rebates via Amaze point which I consider immaterial.,btohqsg
It is useful when using for foreign transaction as amaze link to card exchange rate is slightly cheaper plus get 0.5 percent point,btohqsg
Strategy is alway changing  what work now might not work later,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it 4 mpd?Also if the spend falls outside the category selected  then it‚Äôs 1 mpd?,btohqsg
Now till 29 feb 2024  it is 6mpd on bonus cat. Outside bonus cat is 0.4mpd,btohqsg

It's not because you own credit card that you can't apply EGA. It's because you applied credit card online and they don't have record of your signature that's why you can't apply for the EGA account online. Just go branch,btohqsg

Just sharing. I have a Trust credit card with credit limit of $1000. I made a mistake of requesting for a credit limit increase to $5000 and declaring I'm not working. They rejected my request  and terminated my credit card instead. Dumb move on my part. :(,btohqsg
HI  I have a payment of over SGD3 000 to make for school fees. May I check if there's any cards that would accumulate miles for such payment?Unsure if it falls within a certain category.,btohqsg
Education mcc usually is excluded for rewards unless u use ipaymy and cardup  pay a processing fee to get miles,btohqsg
Hi all  can I transfer back my sgd from iChange to bank?,btohqsg
Quick check  regarding Miles is this valid?Apple Pay for transport 6mpd - UOB Lady's (selected transport cat)Apple Pay for contactless¬†4mpd -¬†UOB¬†PPV,btohqsg
Usual uob stuff like 5 dollar blocks  uni merchant etc would apply more for the ppv,btohqsg
For ppv transaction amount is rounded down to nearest 5,btohqsg
Then points are awarded based on that rounded down amount,btohqsg
if public transport never hit $5 bucks  how ah?,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but only the base point for ladies calculated like that right ? 0.4 mpdThe bonus point is end of month / 5 right ?,btohqsg
If lady card yes. It's a mastercard so simplygo will batch the transactions of 5 days or $15 whichever is earlier. So if u use like 5 days in a row shd get base points for >$5 la.If ppv card the bonus is per transaction so it's near impossible to get base/bonus points coz public transport usually doesn't get to $5 per transaction,btohqsg
No no I meant ladies their bonus points tally up and sum up at the end of the month then wrong to nearest $5 and divide by 5 üòÖ so at worst his earning 5.6 mpd on below $5 transaction,btohqsg
Ya i was just referring to the base point. 2 things can be true at the same time,btohqsg
ok like that Lady's card will still able to hit,btohqsg
contactless and mobile payment same same or different?,btohqsg
different  mobile payment is through samsung pay  android pay  google pay  apple pay etc  contactless is tap card or paywave. mobile payment is contactless while contactless not nescessary mobile payment,btohqsg

Any best way? So use paynow only ?,btohqsg
Is there any perks we can earn by topping youtrip,btohqsg
Use Paynow or top-up from MC. No perks but at least better than paynow and you keep your MC active  easier to get membership waiver,btohqsg
Hi Pros here. Will you be able to help me with the below questions:1. Does CitiRewards cars award 4MPD for all online transactions on Shopee? Or it depends on what the MCC code is?2.

I think it's good to think about orphan points rather than just chasing the best miles cardwhere's your main stash of points? HSBC or UOB?if UOB  you've been using UOBKF which is 3MPD at best for select categories and fulfilling requirement,btohqsg
yes choose travel as categorythen charge up to 1K per month to the cardif you are using UOB Lady's Solitairethen it's 3K on 2 categories,btohqsg

"Looks like for your case  HSBC can fulfil pretty much everythingI will say lodging wise if paying direct use HSBC Revo. If going via third party like agoda then UOB KF for 3mpd (""travel"" does not count by MCC)The rest is pretty much up to you  tho i will recommend tying UOB KF w Amaze for eligible Online MCCs",btohqsg
Thanks Mindy. I will get uob one visa,btohqsg
so to able to convert at least 10K KF points  need to clock $1667?,btohqsg
Lady for Miles   One for CashbackNote that 6mpd ends somewhere early next year however.,btohqsg
Yes (assume all are 6mpd txns),btohqsg
UOB Lady's Solitaire approval strict (need 120K)? I only around 40 to 50K,btohqsg
Yes. 40 i think too low alr if 100 plus mayb have chance. You Can just apply normal ladies card for 1k cap,btohqsg
the normal card (1 cat only) is 30k,btohqsg
the hearsay is you can keep spending on the UOBLC and try to upgrade via SMS in a few months down for the UOBLSCanyway can just apply for both  UOBLSC first and then UOBLClet UOB decide which to approve,btohqsg
UOB$ pool across cards so since you already have a nice sum via UOBKF  you should have bit more leewayedit: UOBKF credits directly so the above doesn't really apply in your case anymore,btohqsg
UOB KF auto convert spending and top-up KF points. Is there UOB$ for both One Visa and KF?,btohqsg
Uob kf no uob$ . Direct to krisflyer,btohqsg

Thats why i say  pair with Amaze... problem solved üòÇ,btohqsg
For UOB Lady's however  if spending is made at an eligible MCC  and if it's a UOB$ merchants the headache is minimal  since u only lose out on 0.4mpd[ You earn 5.6mpd ],btohqsg
you're now asking about the UOB One bank account interest?or the UOB Credit Card cashback?in both cases  SP and M1 bills both apply,btohqsg

maybe some amex cards   i remember someone said that some amex cards give cashback for stuff like topup,btohqsg

I bought 4 economy tickets from SIN to Siem Reap during the Krisflyer 25% promotion for 81 000 miles and $407 SGD.I am regretting not using it for business class purchases instead.Was this a bad deal that I should avoid in the future?,btohqsg
One person can only have one uob acct  if u already have one then the joint account need to be under the joint person name,btohqsg
All depend on your value of miles. I got 3 return to taipei during the sales. To me is a good deal as my miles per cent is around 2 cent per miles compare to the ticket price,btohqsg
The bonus miles come next month,btohqsg
$49 round to the nearest block ($45)  divide by 5. You get 9 uni$ now  9x and additional 5x next month. So total 15x UNI$. You can learn more about ithere,btohqsg

Is there a point to get youtrip card when you already have the amaze card,btohqsg

hi all  i am trying to top u money into ichange. jus curious  if anybody knows topup via 7-11 into ichange app  is it considered 7-11 spending? or financial sth top up ?,btohqsg
I see the points I'm hardly hitting 2k point for the 20sgd in amaze card. Is the rate for youtrip far better then amaze though,btohqsg
yes youtrip rate is better than amaze,btohqsg
i believe trust card is better than youtrip as they have cashback as linkpoints like 0.22% or smth,btohqsg
so the benefits are just tied to the personal account? Or will the other joint party account also enjoy it e.g things like the salary and cc spend,btohqsg
I think need to see what payment mode. But most prob i think only can use cash to top up at 7-11,btohqsg
The benefit tied to the main holder of the joint account ( assuming this is their only uob one account) so the spend need to be under this pax card as a principle card holder and salary credit etc,btohqsg
It is not just instarem point u getting  more of benefit from the credit card ( best been amaze+citi reward for 4 miles per dollar),btohqsg
Not all stuff can use credit card at 7-11. Some service can only use cash or nets.,btohqsg
U want and can do or not is 2 different thing. 7-11 not stupid to bear credit card cost for customer for top up services,btohqsg
if u dont draw any salary   aka jobless  can u still apply credit cards? any loop holes? gurus pls advise thanksüôèüèª,btohqsg

I just came back from Taiwan. I paid the hotel fees with amaze. Exchange rate was 23.0344I tied it to SC simply cash. I should get 1.5% rightAfter the cashback  I see the rate is slightly better than those money exchangers.,btohqsg
I used amaze with Citi rewards   it gave me 3.41,btohqsg
If you include cashback  effective rate is 3.462165,btohqsg
if i rmb correctly the spot rate for amaze is 1.75% and scb is 1.5%. So technically u losing 0.25%,btohqsg
For any cards less than 2.3% rewards  you may be better off with amaze wallet instead.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM?si=x2kdGafu9P2vBh2d,btohqsg
youtrip is 3.48 but of course  you have the stored value issue,btohqsg
Dumb ques but if ure spending $600 monthly  would it be bttr to go for uob evol instead of uob one because uob one needs consistent of 3months $500 to even get the cashback and is not as much as evol..am i right to assume that for uob one is best if we‚Äôre spending 1-2k that range,btohqsg
Hmm. Like not worth to use amaze card overseas liao. Haha. Anyone's can rebut otherwise.  Cos if small spending  youtrip more worth,btohqsg

Hi all! Chris has advised that I ask about my investment question here. Can somebody advise please? Thank you I‚Äôm advance. I was supposed to collect keys to my SBF flat today  but was told I cannot take a HDB loan because I have sufficient funds in OA to pay for the flat. I couldn‚Äôt decide if I should pay with CPF in full or not. Hence I postponed my key collection. Should I invest the funds in OA in t bills and take a HDB loan or should I just pay in full? Would the accrued interest be the same if I pay the HDB loan with CPF versus paying off the flat in full?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt because I have sufficient funds in OA to pay for flat in full,btohqsg
But if I invest my CPF before my next key collection appointment  I will be allowed to take the HDB loan,btohqsg
What you're try to do is OA shielding with T-bills which can be done.,btohqsg
Whether you should or not it is up to you. Some people like home loans (like me) to leverage on other stuff with better returns  some people like debt free.,btohqsg
Shift of OA to another platform e.g. T-bills  or Investment so HDB/CPF cannot deduct from OA,btohqsg
How about the accrued interest part? Would the accrued interest be lesser if I take the HDB loan and pay off instalments with CPF than paying for flat in full with CPF?,btohqsg
Focus on reaching FRS then you don‚Äôt need to worry accrued interest too much.,btohqsg
maybe his FRS also reached. otherwise quite unlikely his OA. can pay off a SBF in full?,btohqsg
Oh no. Far from FRS. SBF is only 2room,btohqsg
then u might want to do OA - SA trf to hit FRS. and then ubcan take the loan from HDB,btohqsg

For Maybank F&F  how is the cashback calculated? I made a transation on 28 Oct using NTUC fairprice app but the transaction hasnt been posted or pending. Will this amount be counted towards my cashback for this month?,btohqsg
need to be posted within the month to be counted if not goes to next month,btohqsg
must be posted within the month to count,btohqsg
can I ask  if i'm planning to sign up for UOB EVOL  will using my fairprice app (with my card tagged to it) to pay for Kopitiam and groceries  are those transactions counted as online spending?,btohqsg
anyone who signed up with HSBC EGA in May received your interest yet? how does it show up on transaction history?,btohqsg
Yes  July & August bonus interest just in today  30 Oct Monday .May & June bonus interest credited on 27 Oct Friday,btohqsg
Is the card in ichange free?,btohqsg
Yes  but cash withdrawals are not free  $5,btohqsg
oh dang i don't see any crediting... any chance you got the T&Cs?,btohqsg
how many days does it takes for a transaction to be posted ? this is for calendar month 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi! For the Ocbc titanium rewards  am I eligible for bonus reward points / 4mpd for online purchases at gain city and other electronic retailer websites?,btohqsg
nope. from 1 nov onwards these retailer is excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks! In this case  which miles earn card is best for big ticket purchases from electronics retailers?,btohqsg
need to spread out payment on different card,btohqsg
uob krisflyer only on online shopping and need to fulfill the minimum spend on sia/scoot related before u get additional miles.,btohqsg
if pay via kris+ u get the 3mpd,btohqsg
can use UOB KF while paying via Kris+. For example harvey norman has kris+ option (I think Audio House is another one).But must be via Kris+. If not  u need to fulfill Singapore Airlines group minimum spend as has been pointed out above.,btohqsg
I have DBS woman‚Äôs card and Citi rewards but bonus earn only applies for online. For offline purchases  recommended to use UOB KF via Kris+?,btohqsg
kris+ seem to be consider as online transaction according to milelions  citireward with amaze will make the transaction online on kris +.,btohqsg
the value of kris+ miles is higher devalued compare to those in krisflyer account so have to transfer miles earn within 7 days on app to the krisflyer account after trandaction,btohqsg
but cards like dbs womans card  citi rewards  hsbc revo all have a max spend limit.UOB KF do not have a max spending limit to earn,btohqsg
while that is true but the point earn start it 3 year expiry as the point earn will be credit to krisflyer account directly. other card can be pool as bank point and wait for conversion bonus. so depend on what individual want out of their spend.,btohqsg
with black friday coming  if can wait then best to wait for the deals. just window shop and make shopping list for the item wanted.,btohqsg
Yup looking out for 11.11 deals :),btohqsg
Hi  today is the 31 Oct  I also encounter the same 1 tick instead of 2 tick issue. I really hope that we will receive the bonus interest otherwise I am going to be pissed üò°!,btohqsg
Hi just wondering if there's any cashback card that gives cashback on air tickets?,btohqsg
where to access the no of ticks?,btohqsg
This is wat im considering too  but i realise harvey norman prices can be much more expensive than shopee or amazon  so need to do some calculation to see if it is worth it.,btohqsg
How to access this page in your UOB phone apps?,btohqsg
Yea I also prefer cashback than miles. I planning to buy sq ticket on nov3 sale,btohqsg
accounts bottom tab > select one account > details top tab > scroll down to view activities,btohqsg
Think there's a visual bug for Android version,btohqsg
Actually harvey Norman can do price matching. You can show them the price on lazada or shopee - but must be using shop voucher only not platform voucher.And all the prices can be negotiable  just ask the sales person. Either they can give discount (especially when you buy many in one go) or can throw in some freebies.,btohqsg
Oh  any publication on sale 3 Nov?,btohqsg
Does HSBC advance or citi reward card exclusion include education services?,btohqsg
Hi guys !

Oh I see.. so if I make my big ticket purchase first  before hitting min spend on sia group  the big ticket purchase won‚Äôt qualify for accelerated miles?,btohqsg
The big ticket purchase mcc need to fall under online shopping too to qualify. We are talking about kris + app payment at selected merchant  2 different issue,btohqsg
hi all  was wondering if monthly youtube subscription count as online spending for UOB Evol card,btohqsg
Actl  just a side question if you don‚Äôt mind. Wanted to ask if going to a physical store with correct MCC  if I use UOB KF + Amaze it should qualify for accelerated miles right? The Amaze card will convert it to online spend?,btohqsg
Dont need  uob kris get 3mpd for kris + transaction,btohqsg
For the prosperus promo  as long as deposit 10k by 31st dec and hold for 60 days  that will be qualified right?,btohqsg
anything not sure can refer to here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/145564,btohqsg
can use smrt citi for online purchase if you are buying more then 500 online and it is annual cap of 12k at 5 percent cashback,btohqsg
hsbc advance  maybank prefer plat(need to hit every month for every quarter)  uob one (need to hit every month for every quarter)  citi cashback plus and alot of base 1.5-1.7 percent card. dcs master also give 2 percent,btohqsg
if u are doing online shopping can consider smrt citi  they give 5 percent cashback after u filfill the 500 spend in a statement up to 12k annual spend within the same statement. effective can get 600 cashback for 1 month and keep the card for next year spend liao,btohqsg
Hi for UOB one credit card  I saw my transaction still indicate pending even though the transaction was on 28 Oct and today is the last day of the month. Will I still be eligible for the cashback or do I wait till tomorrow?,btohqsg

thanks for sharing  will ask if they can do price matching when i shop for electronics for my new hse. Anyway  if u r okay with certain brands like LG or electrolux  it seems like u can earn up to 6.5 mpd if u r buying from KrisShop. 3mpd from UOB KF card  3.5 mpd from KrisShopper Insider member (free member tier upgrade using KF card) if i understand the terms correctly.,btohqsg
Krisshop pricing not cheap  always go for better price then consider the miles earn. If not you are just buying the miles loh,btohqsg
that doesnt seem like a referral. its like a support page,btohqsg
yea  have to do some research to compare. for example the elextrolux vaccum cleaner on KrisShop is cheaper than harvey and shopee. One of the LG fridge is the same price as those from shopee or harvey. Apple watch price is standard across. LG washing machine is jus a couple of dollar more expensve. but there are also those where the price difference is bigger.,btohqsg
i am those personally who like mall voucher more then miles haha  usually get 9 percent discount for mall voucher to use for big ticket item,btohqsg

Hello gurus  may I ask if Instarem amaze pair with Citi reward earn rewards at dentist visits? Thank you,btohqsg
Honestly for me I don't have a lot of time to research and compare. So I just went to Harvey Norman and get a salesperson and tell them all appliances I need. Then look around test and feel  and get them to get me bundle price for all.I was time starved as I had a new place that is totally empty and needed filling up fast so it's livable.So for me - Harvey Norman  pay using kris+ with uob kf 3 mpd uncapped. Saves time and effort.Time is expensive,btohqsg
should be but u might incur instarem 1 percent charge,btohqsg
u know hor electronics store does help new home owner to store the item they buy before key is available.,btohqsg

Hi just to check for ocbc titanium blue card for the bonus ocbc$  here it indicated applicable for Amazon. What i can see from my amaze card from past transaction from amazon it is showing different MCC  eg. 5999   5942  So does all MCC applies for amazon.The ocbc terms and conditions indicated on top of the listed MCC  below merchants applies for the bonus ocbc$   so i assume all mcc code from amazon will applies?,btohqsg
amazon mcc under 5411 aka amazon fresh will not be included. rest is fine. but must use titanium card directly on amazaon,btohqsg
got fee for credit card  u can download comfort app and use the pay hired ride to avoid fee,btohqsg
Anyone face delay in GIRO deduction for HSBC this month?,btohqsg
But use amaze card is ok right,btohqsg
no  have to be direct card on amazon. why do u need to use amaze on amazon? unless u are saying amazon overseas. if u use it via amaze  the amaze*amazon tag might not earn 4mpd,btohqsg
I meant use with oversea amazon   therefore use with amaze,btohqsg
i would not play the chance cause ocbc can reject to award 4mpd with the amaze tag in front. if u want to save on foreign plus 4mpd  try citireward with amaze,btohqsg
Citiward with amaze is capped at $1000 per month. Ocbc will only have this cap starting tmr.,btohqsg
if your transaction not posted by today  it is also toward tomorrow,btohqsg
Understand. But citibank is just 1 card. So want to confirm anyone have use ocbc to tag with amaze on amazon and still get the bonus,btohqsg
Just checking if anyone else here have try to use the ocbc titanium with amaze on amazon and still get the reward ocbc$,btohqsg

Hi Hi  I recently joined the workforce and tried to read up on the CPF top-up but could not find the answer that I wanted or just wanted to double-check some stuff.I just saw your video on the CPF top-up for SA or MA  and I have some questions.1. In the video  it mentions something like if topping up directly to SA is towards the RSTU  which cannot be CPF shielding  then there is also the VC way to three accounts. Is that top-up going into RSTU also  or is it just normal SA? So that I can do CPF shielding.2. If my BHS is max and I do any VC or direct top-up to the MA  does it flow to SA or continue stacking MA?3. OA transfer to SA is normal SA and not RSTU  right?,btohqsg
