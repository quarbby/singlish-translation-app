You sit on a ü™ë then they will spin you,btohqsg
The evo and euro r exp,btohqsg
My car soft la  it was once loud. But those days over already,btohqsg
Need to vtec then got experience,btohqsg
I want feel your bcbr coils,btohqsg
How many rpm then kick in?,btohqsg
I rarely hit 5rpm sia hahahaa,btohqsg
I mean mine also fakr vtec,btohqsg
I never sat in yours at high rev,btohqsg
But I hear ppl say the k20a vtec is different,btohqsg
Mine since got throttle controller able to bring it fast to 4rpm if i put 0 normal it will take forver,btohqsg
Not as fast as your car,btohqsg
But this car is pretty interesting la... I got friend ride in it many times from no interest in car to like cars,btohqsg
@ishengjiegot approval also for euro r,btohqsg
Your steering wheel is the only thing i managed to see cool about itü§£ maybe sit in one go for ride differemt,btohqsg
Cause u keep it very clean not too much mods so nicee,btohqsg
Even kena stop only problem could be the steering,btohqsg
You see the red you know he special,btohqsg
I mean i nvr really saw his car only for like 3 seconds and then i left,btohqsg
But they say old cars having airbag more dangerous,btohqsg
Don't know what will fly out when it blows,btohqsg
Maybe put harness  but I got no idea where it bolts to,btohqsg
Also no idea where... One day must ask you,btohqsg
normally is under the rear seat's back rest,btohqsg
older cars might need dig. if not is don't have a t all,btohqsg
Never notice then at the back,btohqsg
the harness the drill to the floor,btohqsg
can try takata 6 point harness,btohqsg
harness cannot tie down 90deg liddat,btohqsg
You either install a harness bar if you want to keep your rear seats  or you tie to isofix,btohqsg
Then is not a fake vtec la,btohqsg
Then it doesn't sound very good for a 4 door car,btohqsg
Cos it's called a racing harness after all,btohqsg
If you mount in directly downwards  in an accident  you causing more stress on your spine,btohqsg
My friend's swift is he anchor to somewhere in the boot in his swift,btohqsg
‚Ä¶. Why anyone want to do this,btohqsg
then when need to wear at sepang must knock down rear seats,btohqsg
Like that back seat passengers no chance to sit,btohqsg
This one is want look dont want life sia,btohqsg
prob should be pin behind ba,btohqsg
when got passenegrs cannot wear lor  keep the harness in the boot,btohqsg
So only install when go to track,btohqsg
but ppl wan harness and convenience too? haha,btohqsg
But you got harness is another issue,btohqsg
you need a helmet with HANs,btohqsg
Harness but not anchored properly will die leh,btohqsg
if not in an accident  your neck will break,btohqsg
So at the end of the day  you got 1 thing means need another thing,btohqsg
then end up become full race car,btohqsg
Like the example of the swift,btohqsg
If the car get t bone at rear fender,btohqsg
conventional seatbelt you realised you cann pull just a bit out before it locks,btohqsg
The harness gets pulled 20 cm backward,btohqsg
So end of the day  safety equipment actually not that safe,btohqsg
Steering wheel no airbags = Need helmetHarness = Need harness bar and HANS,btohqsg
Steering with airbag could also kill you,btohqsg
if you make it a claymore la,btohqsg
I rmb something about their airbags kena recalled,btohqsg
It just shows up in motorist app,btohqsg
Go for meet also all the camera point away when see euro r,btohqsg
Anyway daily harness is not a good idea also la. You cannot lean in take cashcard  or check blindspot,btohqsg
after awhile it becomes a pain,btohqsg
Was just thinking what can do to improve,btohqsg
There's a swift in SG with a fully gutted car,btohqsg
idk if you all know him,btohqsg
Don't actually have any swift friends,btohqsg
Oh wait i thought u asking me about my camera got dual camera whats that dual cam thenü§≠ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Now i go office  i park opposite side,btohqsg
He daily drive a track car,btohqsg
Because you seldom go they don't give you space,btohqsg
idk how he mange to siam LTA all the way till now,btohqsg
They say none turbo park far away,btohqsg
they go his workplace camp him one,btohqsg
he tried selling but no one buy anyway,btohqsg
In initial d  takumi 86 is a dohc  but the itsuki 85 was a sohc,btohqsg
macham asking what is rotary and piston engine,btohqsg
That time i do your intake,btohqsg
i think i saw is SOHC,btohqsg
but i dont dare to confirm cos i don't believe why a new car still have SOHC,btohqsg
The civic 1.8l is also sohc,btohqsg
your valve cover knn small and skinny,btohqsg
but i dont dare say it out,btohqsg
Cos SOHC is really fking old,btohqsg
but i guess it's a honda thing,btohqsg
SOHC is a 70s or 80s thing,btohqsg
in 90s ppl start to put in DOHC cos it makes more power and efficiency,btohqsg
Should i do 169 for decarboning?,btohqsg
I am a vintage car then,btohqsg
Need to ask honda pros why,btohqsg
Because I was pretty sure the FD were running sohc,btohqsg
Issit cos of Vtec or what,btohqsg
Basically vtec means at 5 500 rpm or whichever for your model or map  your engine switches cam profiles,btohqsg
Turns out it's the same engine,btohqsg
Vtec got for performance and for economy,btohqsg
So your air and fuel more can go in and u get higher compression,btohqsg
Ohh like Gerard one is 5+,btohqsg
Why is a rotary driver teaching u vtec u paiseh or not,btohqsg
Because they put k20s into rx7 overseas üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
What in the war is going on,btohqsg
Vtec is like having 2 displacements in one engine  1 for groceries and 1 for poking,btohqsg
Nah bro  who waste time with vtec for engine swap. Straight to 2jz for 1k bhp,btohqsg
So when your engine goes into vtec  it's not the same as a k20 going into vtec,btohqsg
Those no money one use k20,btohqsg
But put into rx7? From twin turbo to NA ah,btohqsg
But i also believe it's largely due to space too,btohqsg
6 cyl and 4 cyl's block very big diff in space,btohqsg
That time the hoonigan build and battle they took the vq out from the 370 and put a k24 into it,btohqsg
K series engine very reliable to boost it,btohqsg
Overseas they swap engine like change underwear sia,btohqsg
Toyota engine is really can anyhow one,btohqsg
Jz I think must see the engine bay,btohqsg
1jz anyhow also can 700 bhp,btohqsg
Msia got one rx8 did 1jz swap,btohqsg
Yesterday I saw the engine in the 240z... Damn long,btohqsg
wah wait till you see the GR yaris's 1.6L engine,btohqsg
looks like no matter what boost you run it wont piang one,btohqsg
Toyota engine have to give it to them,btohqsg
ang mors they pushing 400hp soon alr,btohqsg
Must see how long will last,btohqsg
For them cars easy to change,btohqsg
but like i've said the block really knn thick,btohqsg
I prefer the look of the Corolla,btohqsg
Looks wise i still rx8 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Same la 4 door family car,btohqsg
Rx8 put body kit add wing damn nice,btohqsg
you see how thick that is?,btohqsg
how you wanna piang this shit,btohqsg
Thats why i said k20 i thought is NA,btohqsg
K20 to mod is put k24,btohqsg
K20 and B16 very popular to boost in angmor country,btohqsg
cos it can tank the boost,btohqsg
B16 also need to sleeve ba‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
for those crazy turbo probably ba,btohqsg
i see in USA they throw the turbo bigger than the block one,btohqsg
But imo‚Ä¶. If want to boost  just buy a boosted car,btohqsg
the lag never ending like time stops hahaha,btohqsg
Boosting a stock NA engine is like putting roller skates onto a nice pair of sneakers it just looks weird,btohqsg
See the turbo? Bigger than the D16 head,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21you see how small the valvecover is? That is how you see SOHC or DOHC,btohqsg
like the hamster eat banana photo,btohqsg
the blue thing on top of the engine,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21the head you see is a big red rectangle  normally that is DOHC,btohqsg
the head is one small skinny dildo liddat,btohqsg
that is why i see your engine I'm like is that SOHC? Or did Honda make something weird,btohqsg
You ask he also won't know,btohqsg
ltr become he ask me more questions,btohqsg
But I heard it's a very hardy engine,btohqsg
There are some things you must know one la,btohqsg
But first must know which is the engine,btohqsg
if not ppl scam you say this car is turboed,btohqsg
Legit ppl always think my alternator is my engine,btohqsg
that's how you know an STI is twin turbo,btohqsg
No idea... Actually I don't remember number plates,btohqsg
Teach this new car ownership boy,btohqsg
Actually google your own car model u can find out if u are sohc or dohc already,btohqsg
Or  bring it to 6k rpm and listen for the vtec,btohqsg
sometimes good to know how to see also,btohqsg
I once go viewed a kia coupe 2.0,btohqsg
the dealer say stage 2 tune 0 to 100 5s,btohqsg
Singapore agents bring in some weird specs though,btohqsg
Nvr been there once good boi,btohqsg
i asked him wah 5s you boost sibo,btohqsg
WRX and EVO 5s i believe,btohqsg
I think kia coupe boost will piang,btohqsg
0 - 30 maybe yes 5 sec,btohqsg
Idk how thin their engine is,btohqsg
A couple in S‚Äôpore became uncontactable after 200 people allegedly gave them S$32 million to help buy luxury goods.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3c6RiiiFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg

For a moment I question myself sia,btohqsg
Just drive down to the workshop ask,btohqsg

@PilotAviator21nv ask us  he just do down,btohqsg

Surprise they got a lot of customer,btohqsg
They use to call other name. Then change,btohqsg
I asked them about xxx they always reply  pls book appt and come down,btohqsg
singapore got near 7 million people. 1 person go down 1 time they enough alr,btohqsg
Knn travel to their ws and what. Hope what j want is there ?,btohqsg

Yeah. Hope he get the bonnet back,btohqsg
When he take back then we whack,btohqsg
If not now his bubble havent form we at there bursting,btohqsg
All band together close down thr shop ü§£ spam bad reviews,btohqsg
They know their drivers don't go at 90,btohqsg
actually idk why SG picked such a weird number at 90,btohqsg
but 60mph is almost 100 ma,btohqsg
Yea their country is slightly bigger,btohqsg
so they decided hmm  maybe we just drop 10kmh enough,btohqsg
Shld be like Germany...autobahn..certain stretches no speed limits,btohqsg
I find that as our cars get safer  with all the tech and shit,btohqsg
That alone will boost the sales of supercars and cull the population of idiots,btohqsg
self driving and anti collision warning,btohqsg
our gahment should consider raising speed limit,btohqsg
they set at 90kmh  then got idiots hog at 80kmh,btohqsg
they set 100 maybe idiots start driving at 90kmh,btohqsg
Lolx...then the driving skills of the general public be raised to a higher level too,btohqsg
Certain drivers really kopi licenses style,btohqsg
honestly i find singaporeans driving too damn slowly nowadays,btohqsg
Dunno how to keep to their own lane...filter out press brake,btohqsg
on expressway during peak hour is constant 60kmh,btohqsg
Cut out to faster lane then slow down to slower than lane 3,btohqsg
Alot of idiots on the roads actually if u drive frequently enuff,btohqsg
I also dont understand why straight road ppl need to keep press brake,btohqsg
on PIE nobody infront of them suddenly break,btohqsg
needle at 81kmh brake back to 80,btohqsg
dk what is lift and coast meh,btohqsg
