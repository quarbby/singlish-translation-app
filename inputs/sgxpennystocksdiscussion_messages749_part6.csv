🎉Pika World Daily Review – 4 Jan 2023🎉🥃Old worries into 2023🔦The equity market reversed early gains and closed in the red as the persistent worries of inflation and rate hikes haunted the market. Recession fear is mounting  and one can expect big moves for the week when critical economic data is announced.📊Manufacturing PMI data signal contraction  but firm🎯While the Manufacturing PMI data reflect contraction  it is still within expectation and thus shows the economy is still threading well. Nevertheless  it is a dizzy market as indices tried to go green but turned sour in the trading session. Policy responses to the aftereffects of Covid -19 remain a deep concern for traders.Moreover  IMF is still predicting that part of the global economy will enter into a recession  prompting fear that the Fed may have over-tightened. After all  a delicate balance is almost impossible.💣S&P 500 is in a dangerous zone🎲We should see tremendous support above the 3700 level. While plenty of bad news had baked into the market  it is a partial set. Buyers were significantly seen at a crucial level when S&P 500 dipped to the 3800 level. Nonetheless  on Tuesday  we are hovering on that level. Hence  it is possible to tilt to the downside risk.Some bright sparks helped support the market. For one  the dip in bond yields had provided a cushion on declining equity prices but whether that can last is still to be seen.📮What are the dishes for the day?📖At 11 pm  we will welcome the ISM Manufacturing data. We expect it to drop to 42.6 from 43.0  further evidence of a weakening economy.Most importantly  at the same time   the JOLTs Job Openings are expected to decline to 10M from 10.334M. A fall will help the market since the Fed is determined to see the job market losing some steam.Next  at 3 am  we will have the FOMC minutes released. We are keen to know two things  whether the Fed is discussing intensively to moderate rate hikes and the possible path ahead.It is 4 Jan  Wednesday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. While the first trading day has been red  the Hong Kong market has displayed remarkable strength  and we hope it remains a pillar of light among the gathering of dark clouds.,btohqsg

The bb then can get excess rights. After that will pump,btohqsg
So better sell away the right,btohqsg
If right to tally w mother share  right shld be below 10 ba,btohqsg
nope  if tally with mother share  rights will be $0.016/$0.017. But rights always trade at slight discount so some will try to buy rights for Arbitrade opportunity.,btohqsg
why citydevt drop so much today/ any bad news?,btohqsg
like some people might buy rights at $0.014. now. say 100 lots.Then convert it at $0.020.Total cost of Acrometa $0.034. which is cheaper than current mothershare,btohqsg
if mothershare price maintain  they earn the difference and can sell mother share later,btohqsg
the place looking stronger today. lets hope and pray,btohqsg
Now is like right down mother share oso down,btohqsg

Recap on this AcroMeta last week's $6.1mil award projectSeems like this news came in very timely indeed at a point where Acrometa is heading into the rights trading today (4th Jan to 12th Jan 2023) and at rights exercise of 1:1 at $0.020 conversion.Coincidence or well planned fund raising exercise by the company? I guess we will find out soon enough because in order for retailers to subscribe  there must be certain incentives e.g (1) rights trading at discount in market. (2) Mothershare rally/rights rally so there might be buying frenziesAnyways  Fingers crossed  hope holders be rewardedSoruce:https://t.co/7UcmijRNNK,btohqsg
