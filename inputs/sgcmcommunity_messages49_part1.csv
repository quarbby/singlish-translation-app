I think F1 cars use CVT.,btohqsg
Actually they are stand alone now. Tom Tom is no longer in use. For sure they got a fair bit more to catch but it will get there eventually,btohqsg
Mr Pete is irreplaceable don’t bother trying 😉,btohqsg
Which map supplier does apple use,btohqsg
No one. Their latest maps are all self done by Apple.,btohqsg
I see. Is it accurate  I got to try them,btohqsg
Apple used to work with Google map  but dropped Google map long time ago and now their map is managed by themselves,btohqsg
So it is not as detailed as Google Map.,btohqsg
It does have some weekness esp in looking up places for reviews. And some places are still missing.,btohqsg
But it is perhaps the BEST looking map. For driving it recently got lane assisted directions too for Singapore. So it has gotten a lot better,btohqsg
Oh and Look around is perhaps more updated than Google street view. And it is 3D,btohqsg
Out of this world. Literally!! 😅😅,btohqsg
Still prefer to swop gears yourself? Here are some manual cars you can still buy in Singapore todayWhich manual car would you pick from this list?Mine is the Honda Civic Type R! 🚗💨👉🏻 React with ❤️ for the Honda Civic Type R!👉🏻 React with 🥰 for the Hyundai i30N!👉🏻 React with 😁 for the Mazda MX-5!👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 for the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution!👉🏻 React with 👏🏻 for the Subaru WRX!👉🏻 React with 🔥 for the Subaru WRX STI!👉🏻 React with 🤩 for the Suzuki Swift Sport!👉🏻 React with 🎉 for the Toyota 86!👉🏻 React with 🙏🏻 for the Toyota GR Yaris!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg

You will be surprised at the benefits of  paddle shifters-R,btohqsg
