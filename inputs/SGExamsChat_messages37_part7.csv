Cause they brought some of the stuff to fm now mah,btohqsg
When they abolish fm they will change the syllabus for h2 math again,btohqsg
I see some trend for the syllabus thing,btohqsg
Moving the things into FM doesn’t mean they have to move it back,btohqsg
And the last J1s to take the old H2 math was 2015 batch,btohqsg
Then now our formula sheet is MF26,btohqsg
I mean thats like the old h2 math,btohqsg
Will it change a lot for the 2026,btohqsg
Like it matches with the formula sheet number lol,btohqsg
FM to be cancelled in 2026 confirmed,btohqsg
According to the mathematical formula 15 theory,btohqsg
J1s in 2026 will be the last for the current H2 math syllabus,btohqsg
So they update every 9 years,btohqsg
They should remove contrasting sub policy,btohqsg
They can’t just put the MF number for no reason,btohqsg
It was popular last time coz no contrasting,btohqsg
Yeah and aircraft manufacturers can’t just name their aircrafts KC 135 for no reason,btohqsg
Basically those who dun want triple science,btohqsg
And the Air Force can’t just name their squadrons 123 124 for no reason,btohqsg
Time to low key fail the safety exam,btohqsg
Yea lol at least the 12 part has a reason,btohqsg
1 is like just the group of planes in general,btohqsg
The last number I dun know lol,btohqsg
It would’ve been way easier if they just told us that,btohqsg
But we know the AELG squadrons have number pattern,btohqsg
8 is just engineers in general,btohqsg
So 807 squadron is the AELG squadron in PLAB,btohqsg
So it does have a pattern,btohqsg
Some of us can become participation command,btohqsg
I hope I dun be one of them,btohqsg
Then dun even have a cockpit to check,btohqsg
while students and employees stay homearmy personnel isolate in camp ah fml,btohqsg
Can’t afford for the military to get sick,btohqsg
yikes they just announced a 6th death,btohqsg
u choosing to stay or go home,btohqsg
I think might as well go home. Sooner or later Govt will force NUS to evict us.,btohqsg
Any1 knows how to fix windows stuck at attempting repair?,btohqsg
I tried undervolting -100mv and it went to a blue screen,btohqsg
If it is eternally stuck most likely it’s broken beyond use without manual repair,btohqsg
It was fine until i tried undervolting,btohqsg
NUS is giving the option of move out by Tuesday or don’t go home for the entirety of circuit breaker if you decide to stay (advisory but incentivised by no refund for early checkout beyond Tuesday),btohqsg
But it’s all online now right,btohqsg
bruh the streets are so lively now,btohqsg
So there’s no benefit for living close to school now,btohqsg
imagine being chased out of your campus,btohqsg
people clearly aren't taking circuit breaker seriously,btohqsg
orchard road is a ghost town  no meh,btohqsg
We’re being chased out of our bunks,btohqsg
as in  your average bedok town,btohqsg
actually SAF loves to keep you in camp,btohqsg
