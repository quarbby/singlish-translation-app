i mean just do it at home pls,btohqsg
my friend say he at sk also got hear ppl cheering,btohqsg
just hope that we arent screwed over tho,btohqsg
Wait u were under sk west or,btohqsg
5 years for SK to repent,btohqsg
Lol my dad was screaming when wp win,btohqsg
"""sengkang has young adults and young children""",btohqsg
Eh I think it's better that wp win,btohqsg
Cuz ah we can have more voices in parliament,btohqsg
Jamus will pose a huge threat,btohqsg
The more opp wins  the more pressured PAP gets,btohqsg
aka better policies for us right,btohqsg
Then we donâ€™t get stuff like pofma and selected presidency,btohqsg
U could tell even vivian was somewhat aftaid of him,btohqsg
Fuck her man why is she a ministerðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
actly whats the hype abt him idgi,btohqsg
my mom said he's v eloquent but other than that?,btohqsg
Top credentials + pretty relatable guy,btohqsg
hopefully he can do shit la,btohqsg
Ah yes those 2 things pretty much shot pap in the foot even though they weren't the main focus of the election,btohqsg
And the debate was very good for him,btohqsg
It showed Singapore that he was worthy,btohqsg
He was a post doc in harvard though,btohqsg
The thing is he was an economist at the world bank,btohqsg
PAP said that they were â€˜willing to pay the political priceâ€™ for those controversial decisions,btohqsg
And nearly losing West and East Coast,btohqsg
If only wp won east coast,btohqsg
I honestly think west coast shld go to psp,btohqsg
If they did I wonder whether hsk would retire or crawl back to tampines,btohqsg
He only have lhl to blame if he lost,btohqsg
Whatever happens to hsk I pray to god buddha allah every single big fuck in the sky that ccs doesn't become pm,btohqsg
Yes which is why lhl's plans to hand over the pm role would be fucked if hsk lost,btohqsg
Tcb lost closely twice. First time in presidential elections to tony tan and now west coast,btohqsg
In this case not just TCB is wasted  PSP too. Leadership renewal wouldâ€™ve been easier if they had West Coast.,btohqsg
I guess yall wont get my nudes heh,btohqsg
The livestream link for the panel is out! Find ithere!Rules and guidlines,btohqsg
Welp yup  not sure who calculated the price for them,btohqsg
Did he add u on Instagram or something,btohqsg
i spent 2h making a meme instead of studying,btohqsg
i dont know how to feel about this,btohqsg
U can start a company making memes,btohqsg
Why not just start app haha,btohqsg
Things would've been so much better back then if we had heard each other's voices,btohqsg
@KopiGaDaiapparently someone from the unit ask him to take temp on a like weekend by 1500 i think but he not even awake until after 1500 LOL then say do temp or cancel posting idk what's wif that guy's deal lol,btohqsg
not really my own experience! (since i didnt ite>poly)but i do have a couple of  close friends (about 4 of them  whom i went thru poly with)all of them went thru the higher nitec > poly route.1-2 of them went to nitec succeed in promoting to higher nitec and subsequntly entered poly :)in a nutshell  it's definitely difficult (i mean  studying per se is inherently difficult. unless you're a genius then hats off to u)however  with hardwork and asking for help etc frm lecturers and friends  3 of them managed to clear poly with a decent gpa(engineering course)one proceeded to SIT while 2 signed on. (both air force as an AFEM) they couldve made it to a local U if they wanted to tho.the other one barelypassed. he's one who has a 'pass can alr' attitude. didnt want help from anyone and everyone.1.0 is the min. to clear poly right? yes he just that 1.xpersonally i felt that he could've done alot more better but to each his own i guess.poly is a place that allows you to be more independent in a sense you have quite alot of free time (def depends on your course too! )so i belive with proper planning and time management  its not all doom and gloom :),btohqsg
hope this helps u in whatever decision you're trying to make! ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
the stupid thing is its a saturday,btohqsg
my unit dun give a shit,btohqsg
have meeting with so many people in a room,btohqsg
