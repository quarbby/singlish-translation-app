Anyone try to use another account by someone else to FAST  transfer SALARY to yourself in SC BonusSaver? To count as salary for the additional interest?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I am considering to buy fridge  washing machine and bed either with Courts or with Best Denki using OCBC titanium.Why Best Denki? Per OCBC website  it stats extra 2% cash rebate on electronics at Best Denki.Does this mean 10x (4mpd) + 2%  thereby making Beat Denki a better choice than Courts (since no +2% extra). Any confirmation from pros here will be appreciated  thanks.,btohqsg
Guaranteed 3.4% only. Look at the fine print,btohqsg

Besides the travel cat exclusion on Citi rewards  the point expiry is abit different. Citi rewards points expire 5 years upon your card sign up date  whereas HSBC rev points expires 3 years from when the point was earned.Points transfer fees is higher for HSBC rev as well vs Citi rewards  think it's about ~$10 more. But for HSBC it's a transfer fee for the whole year whereas Citi is per points transfer. Honestly I think most people will do a bulk 1 time transfer so it doesn't really matter.But one thing to note is that it's annoying to pay for your HSBC credit card bills if you do not have a HSBC savings account as their credit card doesn't support FAST  making it difficult to pay from another bank.(Correct me if I'm wrong),btohqsg
I use GIRO to pay HSBC Revolution credit card bill monthly from another bank.,btohqsg
Hi all. Time to renew work permit for my aunt's domestic helper. Any recommendation which insurance package and insurer I should go for and what cc strategy to use to pay for it?,btohqsg

do u by any chance know when will the first ever statement come in ? 30 days after activating ?,btohqsg
What account is the best for salary crediting?,btohqsg
Depends on the amount of your salary  amount spending on credit card n saving. Basically you can look into UOB one n OCBC 360 to earn higher interest on your saving. If you can‚Äôt achieve minimum spending or salary requirement  CIMB 3.5% is another high interest account.,btohqsg
Worth putting ur spare cash there ? My interest is the 5.8% for one month and not the cash fund. Maybe withdraw after one month. Is it worth the effort ?,btohqsg
In Jul 2023  the max subscription of moomoo is $80k. Compare CIMB 3.5% vs Moomoo 5.8%  the difference is S$156 per month. It depends on individual if want to grab the additional $156 of interest.,btohqsg
Thanks. Opening moomoo solely for the 5.8% seems a tad too much work  but can use it too to dabble in sg shares. Webull is 5.18% but it pertains to only usd  which comes with uncertainty.,btohqsg
Depending on the criterions you can easily fulfill. For me is credit card spend of min 500 monthly and mthly salary credit of at least 1.6K. And the interest overall is better than OCBC  last I recalled. But  I might be wrong,btohqsg
"Hi  for the UOB one account calculator  there is the ""cash rebate"" and ""interest"" calculated out. The ""cash rebate"" is it referring to credit card rebate or no?",btohqsg
Can‚Äôt rmb whether there is a cash rebate. There is the cash bonus i.e. the additional interest one gets due to fulfilling the criterion which is typically credited on the 2nd or 3rd business day,btohqsg
Are u referring to the additional cashback which is also per quarter if you make a minimum of five transactions in a month a quarter on eligible merchants such as Grab  Shopee  and Dairy Farm merchants?,btohqsg
Im not sure whats the cash rebate referring to,btohqsg
Cashback from your UOB One credit card spend $500 per month.cashback $50 x 4 quarters   = $200,btohqsg
