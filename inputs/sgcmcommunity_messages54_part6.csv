I do think that ERP was somewhat effective in the context of kpe and CTE during peak hours of the evening. Post pandemic  there's no ERP at kpe at those times and it has been very congested,btohqsg
Wonder how effective the next gen ERP will be which will be based on distance run on expressways,btohqsg
Doubt it'll discourage people as much as the fixed gantries in place right now,btohqsg
Because it isn't something you go past and can try to avoid  it just exists,btohqsg
Maybe it should give you a loud BEEP for each km travelled to remind you how much you have spent. I think everyone will be afraid to even turn on their cars after that.,btohqsg

Yes for certain timing  so some driver will go earlier like before 7.30 am to not pay erp,btohqsg
So the peak timing from 8-8.45 is less congested,btohqsg
I got colleague come work at around 7.30 am even with no kids to sent to school,btohqsg
They just want to avoid erp,btohqsg
