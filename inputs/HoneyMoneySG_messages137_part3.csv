Hi guys  if I use Favepay or Shopback pay tagged to UOB Preferred Platinum Visa  do I get 4 mpd on dining? Thinking if it is whitelisted as online dining,btohqsg
Any use case to use Ocbc Premier Visa Infinite?,btohqsg
Yeah only 2 PPI mean what to charge to use the card,btohqsg
Cardup w ocbc specific promo code,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Is there anyone who can get DBS vantage card even though min requirement of 120k is not met??,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there's penalty for canceling Amex Ascend card after successfully using Krisgold accelerator?,btohqsg
How u able to do that? I tried to apply thru the app but there is no option for me,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure. It was an option for me in the app so I just applied and it went through.,btohqsg
Do you have an existing credit card with DBS? Did you update your income with them?,btohqsg
Yes i have existing card with them... i last few months just requested for credit limit increase.. so i did update my income with them i suppose..,btohqsg
From my understanding  as long as you can see option to apply for dbs vantage  you can get it. If not  still probably need higher income.,btohqsg
Maybe you didn't hit their income requirements buffer?What I know is the strictly block anyone below $120k income from seeing the card  but if there are people who can apply with lesser  then there might be a buffer that they give (which they will still approve case by case).,btohqsg
A quick question about KrisPay:Amaze card linked Citi Rewards by apply pay in KrisPay  will I earn 4 or 0.4 miles per sgd??,btohqsg
I see... oh well then... thanks!!,btohqsg
Thanks for the prompt answer  Anthony! üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
I think as long never hit at least $100k  I doubt they will approve also.,btohqsg
Some say amaze wallet some say wise.,btohqsg
Some say iChange if you exchange RM most,btohqsg
Only for new cardup user  right? And I‚Äôm not new,btohqsg
Hi just to check one thing. With uob now exclude from amaze  if i will to use uob lady card for oversea dining  i will still entitled to the 4miles/$ under dining category mcc  or only travel category is entitled since its oversea?,btohqsg
Both dining and travel mcc should get bonus uni$. Doenst matter sgd or fcy,btohqsg
Hi  XNAP has been down & removed from App Store. Are there any apps available to replace the unique feature for XNAP? To earn miles/cashback with credit cards from Paynow QR at coffee shops,btohqsg
Amex pay by amexNot amex from uob,btohqsg
Yes. Add your AMEX issued credit card and you can pay through the app. Only at merchants that accepts AMEX pay.,btohqsg
Oh so this method only alllows original AMEX cards? Cannot use UOB One or UOB Absolute Cashback (AMEX),btohqsg
I see. Thanks. Seems there is no other options for coffee shop paynow,btohqsg
Anthony u want to reread the question. Only dining mcc will work if is dining bonus cat. Spending overseas doesnt make it travel mcc,btohqsg
DCS Cards App with UnionPay cards also can.,btohqsg
Is ur lady card base version or lady solitaire with dining and travel bonus categoriesm,btohqsg
I think the main thing to clear up is spending overseas does not make it travel mcc lol,btohqsg
Solitaire  but i only have dining and fashion category selected now  so travel cannot be selected until next Q,btohqsg
hi does mcc 5995 falls under 10x for crmc,btohqsg
Use with Amaze and everything is under 10x ü§£ So since i use Amaze  i dont really mind the MCC's anymore  except hotels/travel/restaurants in hotel,btohqsg
oh really? except travel and hotels right haha,btohqsg
And also careful of restaurants located in hotels,btohqsg
For the HSBC Live+ can waive lifetime annual waiver fee?,btohqsg
Can you hold both the visa & mastercard versions of citi rewards card? So 2*$1000 can be utilised?,btohqsg
I realised I have the citi rewards visa card that I never activated for years probably,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks  I wonder if they would be able to send a replacement card for the visa version if I request for it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs precious  you can‚Äôt apply for it now even if you want to.,btohqsg
Oh I see  I probably need to dig around to see if the card is in a drawer somewhere,btohqsg
As long as the mcc is dining,btohqsg
Most of the time  we be using amaze + crmc. For selective spending on travel expense like hotel  airline etc then we need to remind ourselves to switch cards like citi premiers.  For this combination  it may not earn the most points but it is more the most convenient and I don‚Äôt worry points expiring. I not a high spender so I can take my time to accumulate points and miles.,btohqsg
Guys if I use BOC family card in popular bookstore Malaysia  do I get 5% cashback?,btohqsg
It comes as a set you can order. I also haven‚Äôt tried it yet so not sure if comes with drinks.,btohqsg
was reading the priority pass tnc  seems like each pass deducts $33+ from restaurant bill,btohqsg
Still don‚Äôt seem too bad a deal as lounge food sometimes quite jialat. If want alcohol though still better to head to lounge.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if HSBC travelone cc now allows card holder and the guests to share the 4 lounge access? any restriction on how many guests can bring in everytime?,btohqsg
I think can use all in 1 go,btohqsg
