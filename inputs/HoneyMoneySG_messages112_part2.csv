I tried FAST recently from my personal account - didn't work  so you are right.,btohqsg
"Maybank Platinum Visa is one of them. Can search ""insurance cards"" for more info.",btohqsg
Sometimes can same day get for UOB. I transfer every few months as I got points expire incrementally,btohqsg
You transfer uob which card to kris flyer?,btohqsg
Every few months transfer means you must have spend a lot on the card.,btohqsg
anyone signed up for uob lazada card ?,btohqsg
Every transfer you pay $27 or $25 admin fee?,btohqsg
UOB VI can transfer for free. So just use only,btohqsg
I have a few cards but because UOB miles can pool. So I just use the VI card to transfer for free,btohqsg
Tested with a different bank account name it works,btohqsg
Maybe has to be different account name. ü§î,btohqsg
Yea I doubt same name like uob works  at least not what I seen,btohqsg
Maybe try what samsam said  transfer from another person's account.,btohqsg
For insurance payment   to use Maybank platinum visa or pair with cardup better ?,btohqsg
Depends if you can clock the other 50% spend on Maybank Platinum Visa or not.,btohqsg
So the uob apps unable to check eg uob preferred platinum visa has how many points compare to hsbc apps can see each individual cardsÔºü,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to find it on UOB. But my Citibank does show different cards with different amount of miles. I don‚Äôt have HSBC account so I‚Äôm not sure,btohqsg
Yes. Citi bank you can see it,btohqsg
I think UOB classifies everything as UNI$,btohqsg
Uob miles card are all pool bro. This one discuss before.,btohqsg
But if you go the rewards page can see some info. But not helpful,btohqsg
Yes. I don't want to claim all that is supposed to be under my uob ladies card,btohqsg
Means only claim what is belong to uob preferred visa,btohqsg
It doesnt matter  it is like a rojak and what you are trying to do is pick out the individual ingredient and try to categorise it .,btohqsg
Hi  I need some advice.1) If i spent $1k intrip.comand I cancel and rebook at $900 intrip.comusing amaze card. Will i be charge with 1% fees?2) If I spend $1k link uob lady with amaze card and I cancel and rebook with Uob lady card direct  do I still earn bonus points?,btohqsg
Nice that you managed to redeem on a saver rate. I only managed to redeem my first class flight at an advantage rate  although I redeemed 355 days in advance,btohqsg
Why are you using Amaze? Change currency to SGD and check the amount  sometimes it‚Äôs better than bank conversion,btohqsg
If u exceed the 1k limit for local transaction then yes u will incur fee but why u using uob lady with amaze if is local currency U still earn bonus point on the uob lady for the 900 after the 1k is refunded and deduct accordingly,btohqsg
Bro. I believe if you book on black out dates means spontaneous escape. Maybe cheaper on the miles,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtprobably need to call them again lol. Keep saying mobile key not setup when they already authenticated me via mobile key. Kinda fucked up their system. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èEdit: Apparently Mobile Key can get bugged locally on the device. Wonder what they actually store on the device now.,btohqsg
When does HSBC credit the interest ? What date,btohqsg
Why never receive ah? Me too didn't receive,btohqsg
You already got banned in so many group because you like to give advise and always give wrong advise. Why not you just learn and not try to answer or give any advice? Better that way than to mislead people who may be new to collecting miles,btohqsg
Ok . You can help answer my question. How to check uob preferred visa total how many points balance in uob apps,btohqsg
Bro. I don't want to see total pool points. Just want to see uob preferred visa.,btohqsg
Honestly why does it matter which cards is the points from? When the miles are all pooledAnd I believe on the UOB app you are able to see the points is credited for which card and transaction.,btohqsg
Have you tried using Excel to track your points?,btohqsg
UOB UNI$ are pooled together. Why would you even bother with knowing just the PPV card ? lol,btohqsg
Please don't torture us with this kind of question. You can call UOB Hotline or chat and torture the CSO .. ü§£,btohqsg
Maybe the CSO alrd told him the same thing but he still want to try his luck if it‚Äôs possible.,btohqsg
Because I want to redeem just the points for uob preferred visa. Points belong to uob ladies. I do not want to transfer to kris flyer,btohqsg
wtf  if it‚Äôs pooled tgt  does it even matter?,btohqsg
Can see individual transaction for PPV  cannot PPV total as all cards are pooled. 1 base and 9 bonus per $5 spent.,btohqsg
Of course. He don't want to transfer to kris flyer,btohqsg
No.. I not sure.. and I google also can't find answer,btohqsg
Bro. I only keen to transfer only all the points from uob preferred visa.... before I cancel it,btohqsg
