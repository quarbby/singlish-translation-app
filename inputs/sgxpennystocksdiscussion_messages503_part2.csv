Pika World Daily Update: 11 August 2021A Glowing Prospect In Uncertain TimeThe recent weeks have seen economically  and interest rate sensitive stocks decline. This is expected when the economy is at risk with the Delta variant rooming in the backdrop. It appears to be logical on the surface given more Covid cases in the US and worldwide  with particularly worrying signs in China too.Likewise  recent data points to growing weakness in the economy  and the outlook appears gloomier than before. Moreover  given the frequent change in market leadership  investors find it harder to predict the next trend.In this episode  we will like to provide further updates on our outlook of the US equity market and the economy's underlying momentum.Let's get to the details.We May Expect Green ShootsPika World has several reasons to be optimistic despite a general weaker season for stocks in the Aug-Oct period.1)  Indeed  Covid cases are rising  so is the vaccination pace that helps to reduce the likelihood of hospitalization. Thus  we are hopeful that the US Covid cases could peak by early September  and the decline aftermath may improve the prospect of growth sentiment and increased optimism on the coming school year.2)  Pika World continues to stay constructively optimistic that the infrastructure bill will pass. The ultimate collective fiscal stimulus could be significant when we included the budget reconciliation package discussed in our weekend edition. Consistent with our updates  this will be a 2 part process. First  the Democrats must gather the collective political will to draft the resolution proposal with consensus. After which  this can be iron out into a reconciliation bill to be passed.3)  The weakness of the recent economic data is acknowledged at Pika World finding. The US economy growth and PMI data  vital barometers of financial health  are weaker than expected. However  when we zoom into the underlying details of these surveys  there are bright spots.For example  the US GDP is partly weaker because many businesses are drawing down on their inventories. However  Pika World believes this trend is not sustainable  and heighten production is needed to fill out demands for the later part of the year.Moreover  the labour market remains robust and seems to be on track after an ambiguous reading for the past months.To conclude  while the Covid data and market data back up the weaker growth narrative  we believe that sparkles are possible. Pika World expects more optimism to gain traction that can help push the interest rate higher. Thus  we continue to recommend reducing exposure to government bonds and shift our gear towards defensive counters  including healthcare and financial as part of our base case.What's on the Menu Today?We have come to one of the most important days of the week.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Core CPI data  and we expect it to moderate to 0.4% from the prior high of 0.9%.Likewise  Crude Oil Inventories is likely to see a reduction of 1.05M.Then  FOMC Member Bostic  slightly less dovish in his recent sentiments  may push the case for tapering and provide further grounding for US Treasury Yield to react.It is 11 August  Tuesday  8.10 am in Singapore and 8.10 pm in New York. We hope you have a prosperous week ahead!If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
