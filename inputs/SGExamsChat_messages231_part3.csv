text,group
but sometimes the words you want to expose them to is not inside the story books though,btohqsg
Hmm I donâ€™t tutor English but I would edit the text if I had the energy?,btohqsg
slow ah  now idk  i dont tutor her anymore,btohqsg
maybe u can read some compre passages and compile words for them to learn,btohqsg
this one u go write textbooks alr HAHAHAH,btohqsg
My current job is settling olevel pure physics paper ok ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
But then again donâ€™t compile fully to spoon feed him yea,btohqsg
mhm  honestly a lot of ppl do that no matter what their age. it's just like reading a book and googling a word you don't understand so that you can learn it and remember it in the future,btohqsg
And this is too commonly said but itâ€™s true  when youâ€™re that young rly just spam all the story books u can,btohqsg
Try to encourage that and itâ€™ll go an extremely long way,btohqsg
but so many ppl hate reading,btohqsg
I donâ€™t love reading Iâ€™m dyslexic,btohqsg
My mother force me one LOL,btohqsg
so yea it think u shld do that! cuz yknow they will definitely come across those words in the future,btohqsg
but... you are not their parents,btohqsg
used to read novels all the time as a kid  dont know why i stopped ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
just keep an exercise book  and make them write all of the words they learn,btohqsg
i read like 10 books a week in p1-p4,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t read a book since Sec 2 lit,btohqsg
ooo yea even my sec sch teachers made us do this. both eng and MT,btohqsg
my p4-p6 sci teacher make us do it for sci...,btohqsg
oh like to remember the keywords?,btohqsg
if we get a question wrong  we have to write what we understood wrongly and what is the correct concept,btohqsg
oh that's actually pretty good in theory,btohqsg
i... didnt study in primary sch,btohqsg
Some primary schs are extra shiong one,btohqsg
oh bahahaha i see i see,btohqsg
seeing pri school kids grinding day and night makes me kinda sad,btohqsg
pri sch supposed to be fun,btohqsg
like at that age... that's the last thing you should be worried about,btohqsg
I think now is worse also,btohqsg
just listen in class... and do your homework,btohqsg
not unless is enrichment classes u willingly go for,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think primary sch was super bad for me,btohqsg
because u interested in what u learning,btohqsg
But it looks v sian for my cousins,btohqsg
As in I donâ€™t think I was given as much work and responsibility as them,btohqsg
no i continuing my statement HAHHHHA,btohqsg
yep. i think progressive learning would be better for kids. rather than making them go through exams twice a year for everh subject  make their gears turn by having hands on work  projects  discussions  etc,btohqsg
at some point they start memorising instead of understanding,btohqsg
should not be the point of education,btohqsg
all exams should be open book exams...,btohqsg
and all exam questions should be applied questions instead of recall questions,btohqsg
open book as in able to have a common resource you are allowed to bring in  not your own notes,btohqsg
even if open book I think no time to check the textbook and finish the whole exam one,btohqsg
Sg exams esp O and a levels emphasise super heavily on speed,btohqsg
i rmb i did my psle math in 45 minutes or something,btohqsg
yea i cldnt agree more. life is open book. no one is going to know everything. we r searching on yhe internet constantly  there is no doubt even doctors or PhD holders will google shit. not everyone can understand a concept in 6 months,btohqsg
our brains r all different  why are they trying to wire us to be the same ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
i had an MO... literally google in front of me to find out what my condition is  cos he couldnt recall the exact name,btohqsg
