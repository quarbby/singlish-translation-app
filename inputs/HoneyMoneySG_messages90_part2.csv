5% after 10 ? 15 years ?that's a lie,btohqsg
That's why need to hear from more pplüòÇ,btohqsg
surrendered my ILP during my 2nd year term  lost 8k   i take it as a lesson.... coz after calculating the full 10years commitment  i wont be even get a capital guaranteed the base sum i put in aka 4k per year over 10 years = 40kshort pain rather long pain,btohqsg
at most i can get back is about 35kafter all the admin fees  manager fee  etc etc..,btohqsg
But they alws advise that these products r for long terms,btohqsg
Rule of thumb: investing thru banks and insurers is almost always a terrible idea due to the excessive fees. There is also extremely high moral hazard of them recommending funds that offer the bank/insurers the higest trailer fees. U can always find the exact same or a similar fund thru other diy platform that charges a lower fee.,btohqsg
but they never will say how much you will get capital back after the full term matured  ,btohqsg
Most ilp are using in house funds so the returns are pretty piss poor plus the exorbitant fees charged on top of it.,btohqsg
5% bonus but take 3% back in charges lor,btohqsg
not only that  there is a final maturing fee too  so more then 5%,btohqsg
Hahaha most of them are a joke,btohqsg
ILP maybe for those who don't know how to invest themselves,btohqsg
i learned my lesson  my 8k will never get back but i am smarter now  i rather put the 8k on example moomoo's Fullerton cash fund  which you will see daily(weekday) increment  and surrender anytime,btohqsg
Better off putting in roboadvisors. Have fees  but not as disgusting as most ILPs,btohqsg
yep  robo advisors are also good option...ILP just benefits your FA aka Finance advisorthey earn the most selling ILPs btw,btohqsg
anyone knows how long does singsaver send the rewards collection details after making the qualifying spend for HSBC cards?,btohqsg
UOB invest have direct fund option. But we will need to read up and review all the UOB funds and their performance til date to decide which ones we want to go for. There are a few funds that offer monthly dividends,btohqsg
Yes  melvyn. I'm already having the uob one n ocbc 360 accounts. Beside shopee purchase to clock the min spending for uob n ocbc. I'm thinking if worth to open mari bank to get their vouchers for shopee purchases. But don't see much comment here hence  maybe not worth to open mari. Asking for comment üòä,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to ask those who got the Shopee vouchers from Maribank to show you what those vouchers are n is it useful for you.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone open mari bank and using their vouchers for shopee purchases? Is mari giving out daily vouchers at shopee pls?,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  that time when you made payment via Healthhub  what did the transaction appear as on credit card? For NSC  I just made payment via healthhub using evol and dbs livefresh. Not sure if still qualifies for 6.66% and 5% respectively.,btohqsg
I think not daily vouchers but weekly vouchers. And you get free shipping with selected merchants,btohqsg
You can see what's being offered on the shopee. The only thing that comes close to an actual cashback is their weekly 5% cashback voucher (spend 60 off 8).The rest are coins cashback vouchers which imo are quite trash lol. But it maybe good for someone like yourself who buys stuff off shopee frequently.The vouchers also have a limit to usage...,btohqsg
Buy Term Invest RestIs the way to go.,btohqsg
Hi all  blessed long weekend to all.Just got my long overdue UOB lady's solitaire and wondered if there's a way I can double check my category selection again before I start spending on the card? Thank you!,btohqsg

Does anyone know if I change my mind on a purchase on travel package using Trust credit card  would I be able to request for stop payment?,btohqsg
Hi can my citibank rewards card earn any points by using it for simplygo/transitlink transactions ie taking bus and mrt? Is it better by pairing it with amaze card for this spending?,btohqsg
Simply go is excluded for citi rewards. If im not mistaken,btohqsg
Same here yesterday. Wanted to try just now but long queue  use my Samsung phone with GooglePay  it works. If this thing is permanent  I will just pay with my Samsung 2nd phone ü§£,btohqsg
Thank you. Will bus and mrt fares via simplygo with ocbc 90n mastercard cc will be considered as qualifying spend of min monthly $500 for ocbc 360 account? It will not earn miles or ocbc travel$ cos less than $5 dollar block. I read thru the tnc. I am not sure on point 1.6 for ocbc 90n. Does it mean bus and mrt fares excluded?,btohqsg
Geez. I need to get 2nd phone then.,btohqsg

Anyone has any experience with DBS digiportfolio? Worth investing through that?,btohqsg
Just tried. Can‚Äôt XNAP can‚Äôt work with Apple Pay. Tried it on 2 phone,btohqsg
My impression is 21 days from clicking participate now  but check with cso to confirm. Still have ample time to transfer from now,btohqsg
Invested for 2 accounts since 2019  15-20% loss till date,btohqsg
