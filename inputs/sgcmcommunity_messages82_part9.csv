I just dropped off a rickshaw passenger. I should be the one to win the solar film actually!,btohqsg
Hope everything gets resolved well sir.,btohqsg
Still waiting for insurer surveyor to assess the car,btohqsg
Claim own damage first… to speed up process,btohqsg
There's always one who needs it more than the other,btohqsg
I remember reading an article from GIA Singapore  in an accident  claim from own insurance for repairs first. Thereafter dunno is it insurer or owner then file to claim the other party's. But then I thought usually drivers would claim opposite's for fear of penalty,btohqsg
But for chain collision  from what I gather,btohqsg
Front car will claim middle car,btohqsg
And middle car will claim last car,btohqsg
Ncd of middle car will be reduced even though not his fault,btohqsg
Why is it middle car not at fault?,btohqsg
And impact push middle car to knock front car,btohqsg
Actually is at fault  failure to keep safety distance,btohqsg
If you kept a safe distance and manage to NOT hit the front of the car in the event of sudden braking but then got rear ended and then hit the car in front  how?,btohqsg
And you can prove you kept a safe distance just that the front slammed on their brakes for whatever  cat run across the road..or rickshaw suddenly crash,btohqsg
i put then the screen crack,btohqsg
You put wrong side. If put outside  then it will protect the windscreen at the same time 😂😂,btohqsg
Put on roof so roof not too hot,btohqsg
Then would it be 50:50? 🤔,btohqsg
