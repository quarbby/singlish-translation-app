Anyone uses IBKR? I use Tiger and Momo mostly  and recently my friend introduced me to IBKR  not sure if its as reliable as the ones I use now? Hope to hear some opinions!,btohqsg
the best broker ever. lots of people use it,btohqsg
in what sense? as compared to the other trading apps.,btohqsg
Best exchange rate  good fills and quite reliable,btohqsg
for moomoo  they will only charge commission if you do trade? if say you buy into reit and receive dividends wont need to pay commission?,btohqsg
ty  helpful to know i’m not alone haha,btohqsg
poems takes a few working day to deposit/withdraw. But for me no issue buying stocks/ut then transferring them the money 2 days later,btohqsg
Did you remember to put your 7 digit a/c number,btohqsg
3-6days withdrawn is a prem feature 🙄Card also restricted to 250 per transaction,btohqsg
So they are doubling down on this hur. I thought their CEO said will restore instant withdrawal.,btohqsg
I dun understand the part where $250 limit per transaction,btohqsg
Err actl where does it say permanently 3-6 days?,btohqsg
Meaning instead of calling $1000 now it's at $250,btohqsg
I'll practice the same. Keep sufficient amount like 10$ for day to day spend amd only top up when needing to pay.,btohqsg
Its not perm in the sense that instant will never return hahah just inhale copium for the future I guess,btohqsg
Send in email  which I reckon to all account holder,btohqsg
Up to you if you want to trust this promise. 😁Gentle reminder: chocolate finance is investment account  not mobile wallet.,btohqsg
The 250 do limit my options to pay my prudential bills 😢,btohqsg
I rather have trust card than Choco lol,btohqsg
Can pay multiple times I guess. I can't remember if ipay allows that.,btohqsg
Chocolates financeI'm wondering whether I should withdraw my $20 000 or just leave it as is,btohqsg
U see the change history from them then decide from there. Ownself money don’t follow others,btohqsg
What you means by change history?,btohqsg
If not hard on cash and want to continue earn the daily credit  can continue with CF,btohqsg
So now we no longer earn 2mpd for AXS (housing bills  insurance  education) payment?,btohqsg
I'm worried that if I don't act now  I might not be able to recover my money. However  I'm still undecided since I don't urgently need the $20 000 at this time.,btohqsg
Have yet to try SAM from SingPost … maybe that’s another possible options…Any guru tried ?,btohqsg
No. You CANNOT perform any transactions on AXS using Choc finance card.,btohqsg
lol you have answered your own question,btohqsg
If want a piece of mind  just withdraw and park the money in with banks first.,btohqsg
$250 limit means no more big ticket items purchase,btohqsg
Anyone withdraw on Sunday and successful? Or all is pending?,btohqsg
I wonder if they process first come first serve  or smaller amounts first,btohqsg
"Hi  may i know for UOB Preferred Platinum VISA card  does ""online shopping"" include Grab  Gojek  TADA & Shopback  Fairprice  Favepay?",btohqsg
Since they're counted as online for Citi Rewards. Does it apply to UOB PPV as well?,btohqsg
Do we receive interest for the 3-10 days processing time for CF withdrawal?,btohqsg
No. They already write when u withdraw. No interest,btohqsg
Wow and for recently deposited it will be even longer,btohqsg
Doesn't matter if recently deposited or not. They need to sell the fund holdings first only after then transfer you the cash.,btohqsg
Assuming it PayNow  hope it’s resolved. Do note time period excluding 15 mins timeframe. At least you can call CSO  they quick to take your phone calls unlike CF.,btohqsg
Still can split into multiple payments,btohqsg
eligible for 4mpd if the online spend fall under these MCC,btohqsg
I have a question on the date of application of cc. If my current three credit card approve on the same date around 25 October last year. And how if now I apply for the uob lady card and ppv  will it high chance reject my application?,btohqsg
Does anyone receive the HSBC everyday Feb global bonus interest promotion SMS today? When you didn’t register for it.,btohqsg
Do I still get 4 mpd if I use Citi rewards card on Agoda/booking.com?,btohqsg
CRMC never did reward 4mpd travel related transactions,btohqsg
guys  how to ensure its +500. i fear if i take out my extra income too late my MAB for next month will be lower,btohqsg
