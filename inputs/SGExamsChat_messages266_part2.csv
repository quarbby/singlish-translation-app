Why should we hire youWhat do you know about usWhat are your strengths and/or weaknessesHow will you handle conflict in your workplaceAre you a meticulous or big-picture personOther questions specific to the job role eg have you done this and that before,btohqsg

Usually they won't ask unless they asked during application process,btohqsg

I have one more question regarding the interviewWould they ever ask about my O level results  especially English language?,btohqsg
nah not really. Actually is also about the way you structure your reply back  if your english is not good  why not just tell them honestly and say that you are doing xxx to improve it and hope to improve further by xxxx,btohqsg
Not really if you've done some English language-related thing for poly,btohqsg
For some reason  only governmental roles tend to look into your past results even if you have something that is of higher qualification,btohqsg
So far I don't think I've submitted O level results for most of my applications and no one asked,btohqsg
