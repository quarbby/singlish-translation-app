he should just bring his girl to singapore registry of marraiges and see how his girl argue her case,btohqsg
The whole building is gonna come down and watch them,btohqsg
"""eh  come and watch this girl trying to get married to her secondary school boyfriend""",btohqsg
Either he's truly desperate or that's just some fantasy,btohqsg
this one related to exams meh,btohqsg
Weekends can post non exams stuff,btohqsg
I mean honestly the article not wrong la,btohqsg
is 1month n 15 days enough to lock in for Os 💀,btohqsg
I started studying for o levels 3 weeks before actual o levels  while in prelims.My combined science was 35/100,btohqsg
I just did a bunch of Tys  then passed with a combined C6 for combined science,btohqsg
What's your score? If it is just 1 or 2 subjects  sufficient to push to a minimum B3.,btohqsg
1 or 2? Hopefully neither are languages,btohqsg
enough or not ... have to lock in anyway,btohqsg
if it is  then should be ok to join a common course then pivot to the indiv diploma of your choice. just keep improving tho,btohqsg
idk sia i scared cannot pass now 💀,btohqsg
languagues just watch more tv shows or news relating to the languagesScience and maths just do tys or assesment books  more exposure to qns the better,btohqsg
normal if the level of prelims is difficult than O Level,btohqsg
WHEN YOU WAKE UP NEXT TO HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,btohqsg
WITH YOUR HEAD IN YOUR HEADS YOU'RE NOTHING MORE THAN HIS WIFE,btohqsg
my actual score for o is 25,btohqsg
I studied for 2-3 mths so,btohqsg
i want back the old one,btohqsg
I nvr get anything new hahahahaha,btohqsg
my pc immediately switch to the new one after june,btohqsg
maybe I am running new teams and I didn't realise,btohqsg
too used to changes to the point of not noticing any,btohqsg
hi guys asking on behalf of my brother who claims his wa1 results isn't accurate for prelims & national exams predictions,btohqsg
if his rough aggregate for N(A) is like about 19-21 points right now but his best was semester 1 in sec 3 where he scored below 17 points.. do you think it's possible for him to end up in poly,btohqsg
my prelims was 40+ my o level was <70% of that I'm sure he can make it,btohqsg
should i talk to his girlfriend and encourage (more likeforce or scold) him to study since he gave up 75% of studying after mobile guardian wiped students' notes??,btohqsg
bro's playing mobile legends bang bang & roblox with his friends(?) like they don't give any flying fucks about N or O lvls anymore 😭,btohqsg
LOL tbh if that happened to me I wld give up too,btohqsg
All f9s quite unusual for Os/Ns,btohqsg
I went to poly with 26 as a NA student  he def can go poly..but only prob is his course and school,btohqsg
Nyp nursing is filled with 28 people,btohqsg
Usually common courses have the highest cutoff of any courses in poly excluding nursing,btohqsg
then how did u get in,btohqsg
If he have no clue what specific diploma go to a common course,btohqsg
O level results 😂 just put it as a 2nd choice and got in,btohqsg
if u aim 28 pmts or less  highest cop is nsg followed by engineering courses  early childhood care. can try dae if u get 26 or better but based on availability of courses,btohqsg
Wait a second I just realised it's N levels,btohqsg
My school Na to Poly was 6% of the Na cohort,btohqsg
All had below 11 for n levels,btohqsg
If he wants go poly  go sec 5 only way.If he ends up going ite  he may not touch maths/science for 2 yrs as he learns his technical skills.He may end up going poly through ite. The prob is he may not be able to keep up with the subjects taught in said poly course.Like my friend higher nitec aerospace eng  4.0 gpa to nyp aerospace as well.He did not touch maths for 2 years  he go through first sem. Can't understand anything.,btohqsg
hi can i ask u how yall score well for bio ? my exams are tmr @3pm. i legit study crazily mad the pst week and i am scared like i actually cant remember most of it. for me  i try to understand the process of it and read thru the notes like thousands of times. do u like memorise the word for word or rmbr the keywords ?,btohqsg
Why memorising instead of understanding concepts,btohqsg
my lecturer said so bt i watched videos on yt to understand the topics and reasons behind them,btohqsg
1. memorise keywords2. do tys3. dun panic,btohqsg
if it's tomorrow then tbh most realistic thing is to pray to wtv religion/deity/supernatural liao,btohqsg
bio needs consistency  no need word 4 word but need to understand the concepts,btohqsg
also need to do more practice qns  idk if you doing A levels or poly  but you need to ATQ and cannot js blindly regurgitate whatever,btohqsg
26 is min for general courses,btohqsg
RP got. It's in the library repository,btohqsg
Usually have one is just need to ask and find,btohqsg
does it comes with ans key ?,btohqsg
Should be? Depends on mod but most come with answer key,btohqsg
I know of some module chair asshat and dw to give the ans key and u have to get it from em personally but that's the exception,btohqsg
hello!! does anyone here have any issue using the nlb app? i've been trying to go in for weeks to book a study spot but it always stays at the loading screen😭😭 a few of my friends have the same problem,btohqsg

u can scan the qr code using the website,btohqsg
A quarter of Gen Zs in Singapore do not have enough rainy day savings  life insurance coverage or investments  according to a bank poll.The study also found that Gen Zs are the most financially unprepared out of all the age groups surveyed.https://str.sg/5AVXGet the scoop on ST's most-read articles with our Telegram bot:str.sg/newsie,btohqsg
my uncle used citibank and was charged 1000usd w/o buying anything ( fraudulent charges ),btohqsg
idk how hackers manage to know dr card and cr card details without having the physical card,btohqsg
i think most of us are also scared to lose money due to high risk investments. the thing abt investments is either u earn more money or lose some. most of us choose reliable sources of investments which are banks but the interest rate aren’t high. also for uob  you need to spent at least $500 on average for debit / credit card and many students can’t afford that on a daily basis,btohqsg
lol gen Zs are financially illiterate,btohqsg
true and many don’t bother trying to understand more,btohqsg
thanks all for helping prop up the economy,btohqsg
u don't need to be employed to be financially literate?,btohqsg
huh i thought the article referred to gen z aged 18 and above,btohqsg
Gen Zs in Singapore do not have enough rainy day savings  life insurance coverage or investments  according to a bank poll.,btohqsg
ya cause y'all all spend it on dumb shit and not save it,btohqsg
gen z delude themselves into having literacy when we ( other gen z including me ) don't,btohqsg
I thought they are not working,btohqsg
if gen z ppl open bank/savings  obviously they have some source of funds,btohqsg
and anw... having some basic investments or at least understanding is useful mah...,btohqsg
the article mentioned gen z ppl do invest among the other age groups surveyed iirc,btohqsg
or at least how to get the most out of the bank accounts or cards that u can get,btohqsg
ya this one is the problem with gen z,btohqsg
Article Suggestion 1 It is good practice to have three to six months’ worth of expenses as emergency funds.,btohqsg
Article Suggestion 2 consumers get insurance coverage for death  total permanent disability and critical illness Article Suggestion 3 invest at least 10 per cent of their take-home pay Article Suggestion 4 make wills and CPF (Central Provident Fund) nominations.,btohqsg
article aso unreasonable 18 year old how to get,btohqsg
60 per cent of those polled have at least three months’ worth of expenses saved  with the Baby Boomers (aged 58 to 65) most prepared and Gen X (aged 42 to 57) the least prepared.,btohqsg
Article Suggestion 2 consumers get insurance coverage for death  total permanent disability and critical illness  nominations.                                        Gen Zs had the least insurance coverage compared with other groups.,btohqsg
Article Suggestion 3 invest at least 10 per cent of their take-home pay.           In terms of investing  those aged 18 to 41 were the most diligent.,btohqsg
Article Suggestion 4 make wills and CPF (Central Provident Fund) nominations. As for legacy planning  half of those polled said they have made a CPF nomination  while 19 per cent said they made wills.,btohqsg
Of course most will not meet suggestion 2 and 4,btohqsg
The poll also found that the greatest increase in expenditure from the year-ago period for consumers in Singapore was utility bills  followed by daily commutes and children’s education  as well as household groceries. Singapore consumers were also outspending their regional peers on experiential categories such as travelling for holidays  fine dining  concerts  events and festivals.,btohqsg
thank u for breaking it down,btohqsg
that thing is made out of plastic and sold from $60-$300,btohqsg
entertainment  leisure  food  merchandise  subscriptions excluding everyday life essentials,btohqsg
I thought Secondary Schools and Polytechnics have financial literacy lessons but they did not want to attend?,btohqsg
it’s hard to get a sense of scale when it comes to money at sec sch age,btohqsg
I thought money earned is to spend one?/s,btohqsg
secondary school: some people chose poa as a subject and they js learn terms and bank statements like cash at bank  trade payable.polytechnics: do not offer this anymore,btohqsg
oh we didn’t have that in sec sch last year,btohqsg
ya during sec sch it's either during FT time or CCE lessons,btohqsg
FT = form teacherCCE = character & citizenship education,btohqsg
Ngl but POA is pretty useful,btohqsg
Back then my POA teacher actually organises a financial literacy talk during like assembly,btohqsg
FT Time is called HR here,btohqsg

10 weeks not enough. In UK  maternity leave is 52 weeks (1 full year),btohqsg
it happened to me for HSBC and Stan Chart  and for my wife on OCBC and DBS.Any bank can happen. As users  we need to look through everything on the bill to try to match what was spent  and not let such stuff slip past us.,btohqsg
In between the lines:Gen Zs are the best people to approach to sell insurance or investments  because they don't have much yet.Which is a duh because that's like between 12 to 27 yrs old  though article did say 18 to 25,btohqsg
Pretty sure 12-21 cannot even buy investments.. or insurance,btohqsg
Can meh? When I try usually I cannot buy as below 21,btohqsg
Need a parent to cosign or smth,btohqsg
I remember NS time don't need lehBut my BMT was year 2002  so...,btohqsg
For me since I below 21 usually when I say that it repels most insurance agents,btohqsg
For now I am legit below 21,btohqsg
Not soon. But I am still telling the truth now,btohqsg
what if sgexams did a financial literacy workshop,btohqsg
STOP BUYING STOCKS! I WAS SHOCK WHEN MY MENTOR MARY BUFFET TOLD ME DIS,btohqsg
they get large commissions from selling ILPs which you don't qualify,btohqsg
Ya basically lor that's why rn no need for insurance anyways,btohqsg
Cuz NTU provides us with coverage too,btohqsg
"my reply to you is ""?""",btohqsg
That gawd damn ad. Shown so many times I can remember the first 5 seconds,btohqsg
I genuinely don't know what ad you're talking about,btohqsg
I heard the words when I read this 😭,btohqsg
U must have not spend much time on yt,btohqsg
I remember 5 seconds because u need to watch 5 seconds to skip the ad,btohqsg
My finger typically hovers above the skip button,btohqsg
Idk if I am imagining things  but it feels like that 5s is more like 6 or 6.5s,btohqsg
idh so much money to give YouTube,btohqsg
Tip  before starting a video. fast forward to the end and replay the vid. No more ads,btohqsg
I must do the “one thousand … two thousand …” counting next time,btohqsg
If u spam it it will be cuz u press wrongly they show u the landing page of the ad and pause the vid,btohqsg
I just close out the tab and reopen,btohqsg
But it is only worth if it's the 15 second ones,btohqsg
"what do you mean by ""what if""?",btohqsg
Is 7k a high starting pay? I'm not sure if it's only 75th percentile,btohqsg
7k is the pay of a crane operator that has worked for 20 years,btohqsg
the coverage is only within school.,btohqsg
depends on industrybut generally among peers  it's sufficiently high.,btohqsg
traders I think do earn that much starting. It's very good if you are consistently winning in the trades.But if your trading strategy is frequently unsuccessful  out is also very fast.,btohqsg
I mean on school sponser trips la.,btohqsg
insurance is also limited onebut hor generally students don't need because in terms of finance  students are generally not breadwinners and hence not an important financial pillar of the family,btohqsg
is it because younger ppl like 12-17 is new to banks and didn’t know theres hidden tncs like minimum $500 to spend per month for uob,btohqsg
no  article ignored them as irrelevant,btohqsg
do u call the bank up fr this and will they give 100% back the money ?,btohqsg
yes. If it's very clear it's not your purchase  sure refund.Usually for the scammers type  it's very obvious,btohqsg
then how do we grow our money,btohqsg

What's the maturity on that investment vehicle?,btohqsg
Alternatively  if u cannot finish spending your savings  you can donate to the state or give to your nieces and nephews if u like,btohqsg
which uob card are you talking about here? stuff like min spend isn't a hidden tnc. it's just a p normal tnc that's more for getting some sort of monthly/quarterly cashback,btohqsg
Why would I donate to Ah Gong?,btohqsg
I bought a life insurance plan for each kid. It should ideally reach about 60k by the time they are 60 yrs old.Not a lot  but enough for them to go for a nice holiday around the year 2080,btohqsg

I am not sure if Singapore would even be Singapore 55 years from now,btohqsg
55 years from now would be a good age for me to die,btohqsg

If it's a Si Yan mod u can tell the TA right here,btohqsg
hell nah i actually need to attend lmao,btohqsg
im actually too dumb to understand the content my own,btohqsg
he actually dmed me questions about the mod,btohqsg
Would u give him addition bonus points,btohqsg
minus marks for taking up extra time off Si Yan,btohqsg
I wonder if he has the authority to do that,btohqsg
0 - more is still 0...,btohqsg
are you going for lecture tmr,btohqsg
0 divide by 0 is indeterminate,btohqsg
like if im gonna attend your tutorial i might as well attend lecture,btohqsg
i saw he started using pen and paper with projector,btohqsg
dude im really pissed off about it,btohqsg
i cant see clearly at all,btohqsg
yea i'm kinda planning out how i'll cover things tmr,btohqsg
Does the TA attend lectures for Physics?,btohqsg
bc i'm guessing a lot of yall couldn't rlly absorb from lecture,btohqsg
why dont he get on the times and write it on an ipad or something like most professors,btohqsg
he used to do that when teaching me like his entire lecture was writing on powerpoint,btohqsg
Is probably just empty by Week 3 assuming Prerecorded,btohqsg
then people complained he didn't have proper slides,btohqsg
even tho he already gave like a damn nice set of pdf notes,btohqsg
but idk why he don't just annotate further on the current slides,btohqsg
but yeah im really quite certain im not gonna be absorbing much,btohqsg
half the time im gonna be figuring out what he is writing,btohqsg
i'll try to go slowly and review a bit but not all tutorials i'll have the time i think,btohqsg
between tutorial questions  wooclap and sometimes quizzes,btohqsg
youll have to do your best but just know you're not obligated,btohqsg
but we as a cohort will be thankful,btohqsg
Walao so good u have direct access to your TA 24/7,btohqsg
if you do manage to slot in reviewing,btohqsg
Maybe I transfer to Physics just for that,btohqsg
im pretty sure he advertises his tele,btohqsg
My TA after class runs off to narnia,btohqsg

ntu is too big to not have some insane people,btohqsg
Thats what you did to my brain,btohqsg
Si yan : do you have any questions?Me : yes what the fk am i looking at,btohqsg
then again i wonder if its gender reverse,btohqsg
if its guy stalk i feel like gna jail,btohqsg
or is it cos its more of email harassment than actl stalking him irl,btohqsg
depends on the terms of the protection order,btohqsg
I knocked out in chew lock yue lecture today rips,btohqsg
Thank god he havent ask for wooclap,btohqsg
while stalking and harassment can cause psychological harm 69 years is not a realistic sentence,btohqsg
Jokes on me i overslept for today's lecture,btohqsg
i completely restructured my tutorial methods after monday lol,btohqsg
When i woke up it was 1350 already,btohqsg
Yeah i think you did well today,btohqsg
and also sort of bc part of it is probs how much of a threat or issue they are,btohqsg
i made slides to review the main concepts,btohqsg
then they ask if i can send but need to check with prof first lol,btohqsg
ya like as much as idl to say this kind of things  she mostly caused him mental distress but prob did not pose a physical threat to his personal safety,btohqsg
I can guarantee w you they would have taken pictures,btohqsg
that's why the fine and not jail time  as some male stalkers may actl attempt to get physical with the people they stalk,btohqsg
iestin said he’d point out the cute girls but didn’t,btohqsg
Ok lurh  now hopefully you can help iestin friend also,btohqsg

manadr has long lost its credibility after it came under fire for ppl abusing the teleconsultation so if you're wanting to get an medical certificate through such a service  you might want to confirm with your superiors/lecturers/teachers whether they accept MCs with such origins,btohqsg
anyways this is according to their FAQ,btohqsg
ppl would say who cares because teleconsultation services are cheap & fastjust like the situation with getting free money from the luckysg bot despite knowing it's sussy,btohqsg
tbf teleconsult is quick n dirty way to get mc,btohqsg
they have the incentive to drag the consult on lol,btohqsg
not done yet ... next is to remove cycling paths and turn it to footpath,btohqsg
But even 2 minutes for $11 also can?,btohqsg
Omg I actly didn't bother reading into it,btohqsg
Ig they don't care as long as MOH certified,btohqsg
Wait you legit get free money?,btohqsg
I'm just scared if it's a scam and isn't certified,btohqsg
there been many other simillar bots  yes you get money but majority will like get cents,btohqsg
Idk but I don't really trust free money  especially cus the stats for scams are extremely high,btohqsg
you just need to understand what information you’re giving out,btohqsg
and i doubt they'll let a participant with potential bias join even if im within range lol,btohqsg
If I am over 18 but mentally 16  can I join hahaha,btohqsg
Anyone who's awake at 3am is eligible,btohqsg
Thats an 18 year old sleep schedule,btohqsg

promo codes are either1. time limited2. usage restricted3. expired (usually a lot of ppl claim then the promo code's gone)and going to customer service will end up having a few hiccups here and there almost 99.9% of the time,btohqsg

im nt sure… i heard frm my cousin the name was really sick / rallysick ???,btohqsg
Udemy + Coursera sucks for Engineering Professionals :/if only they could make NUS/NTU Masters Micro Courses there.,btohqsg
help me tell your cousin thank you ah 🙏🏻,btohqsg

I think i went here for camp,btohqsg
bad case of nasi lemak with bad sambal?,btohqsg
why the school sign board screams military camp already,btohqsg
nope. gastroenteritis - i assume this mean food poisoning haha,btohqsg
you say Nasi Lemak with bad Sambal ?,btohqsg
just an assumption on what they ate. Typically in Malaysia  food poisoning cases are from nasi lemak gone rancid.,btohqsg
hi guys  anyone knows where i can sign up for industry attachment during the dec hols. for context i am j1 and i couldnt go from my school and thats why i am asking,btohqsg
which industry are you looking at,btohqsg
like something related to engineering/science research,btohqsg
Not much point for engineering generally  from ex-engineer POV.Your level of knowledge is insufficient at the moment.,btohqsg
What you planning to do in your degree?,btohqsg
I thought singapore have those A**Star program things,btohqsg
yea but the deadline over alr and im not singaporean,btohqsg
for 1 month  you don't really benefit,btohqsg
but i really need it for my portfolio🫠,btohqsg
2 weeks is onboarding and offboarding,btohqsg
you don't really need that for engineering or research,btohqsg
u can't do anything in 2 weeks,btohqsg
I mean if you want to do astar maybe can uh if it is like a jc attachement thing but that is if it is a jc kind of thing,btohqsg
If your grades are there  you are better off polishing interview skills.,btohqsg
ahhh you Malaysian  or what? I'm not sure about Singapore Internship things as a foreigner.,btohqsg
that's the best portfolio u can have,btohqsg
Actually if you dont mind me asking,btohqsg
If you like Programming  I believe 42 Singapore / 42 KL / 42 Johor* exists.,btohqsg
like how? can give example irdk,btohqsg
42KL been blowing up strongly in Sunway Malaysia.,btohqsg
I'm sorry but if u ownself what u wna do in the future  hard for me to give example,btohqsg
What are you aiming to study in university. It's all about grades if you are looking at local uni,btohqsg
easiest example to give is if u want go computer engineering  then do coding project,btohqsg
not sure tho but maybe design engineering or chemical engineering,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrm77GCfjXk- Apparently it is conducting in SUTD.,btohqsg
that one JC too early for portfolio la,btohqsg
join volunteering or outside leadership stuff,btohqsg
not sure my friend was Malaysian  he gotten into the A**Star program doing AI stuff as a studying as a Mechanical Engineer at NUS.,btohqsg
Grades AND portfolio is equally impt,btohqsg
but my friends all did jc industry attachement,btohqsg
so i abit scared idh enough,btohqsg
engineering not much on any portfolio during JC.Knowledge is grossly insufficient  and this is known. HR will just ignore your JC stuff.,btohqsg
but this time 70 rp leh,btohqsg
go to IC design field. Also not much knowledge  if the job is data collection.Atmost everyday compiled test reports into nice looking charts.,btohqsg
Some internship is do nothing  learn nothing. End up waste time only.,btohqsg
u can read up more into the field lor  get your own knowledge into the industry,btohqsg
yall got any other tips for portfolio?,btohqsg
for engineering  there really isn't that much at your level,btohqsg
Actually since you are aiming for a STEM related industry,btohqsg
u mean tutoring as in via hours,btohqsg
btw  you studying Chemical Engineering for learning chemical reactions. Or just want to help company handling Plant Operations? 😂,btohqsg
at a jc level  there's genuinely nothing you can do apart froma) having rly good grades (including science Olympiads and wtv other similar things)b) volunteering  having a leadership position (be it in school or outside),btohqsg
if you are not scoring >80% for any subject yet  you might as well work on them,btohqsg
for local uni  if you have the grades it's really not an issue for most engineering fields,btohqsg
Tbh I think she can still tutor mostly those doing O levels at max.,btohqsg
and imo tutoring doesn't do much either,btohqsg
you can tutor after you settle a levels,btohqsg
what is your purpose of wanting to tutor,btohqsg
tutoring doesn't do anything for portfolio,btohqsg
unless you want to be a teacher,btohqsg
Tutoring also doesn't help in being teacher,btohqsg
for engineering  not much will add value to your portfolio outside of just grinding for those As,btohqsg
ok tutor knows more than me I kowtow,btohqsg
My wife sch teacher some more,btohqsg
if you wanna join MOE you typically want v good grades too,btohqsg
i see from both sides of the industry,btohqsg
so tldr is just grind for A levels,btohqsg
lol I was having a discussion about how much time a teacher spends per week creating his own teaching materials,btohqsg
even for jc tutor  I used to spend hours. Only recent years I taper down cuz mostly created.Now I thinking to create more books to sell.,btohqsg
i'm a TA and still make some of my own materials,btohqsg
My first 6 chapters of H2 Physics  over 200 pages of materials already 😭,btohqsg
I am a lab demonstrator and have to show a student what is a log log graph,btohqsg
lol half the time i'm an engineer as a lab TA,btohqsg
replacing a lot of fuses bc people fry the machine,btohqsg
opening the oscilloscope to see what's going on,btohqsg
when finishing uni  time to read up on financial management liao.,btohqsg
Trust me when i say my role as a lab demonstrator is to exist,btohqsg
I came for a session not mine  I saw the other lab demonstrator just sitting there,btohqsg
now that there's 3 TAs per session,btohqsg
the business of a lab demo is kinda low,btohqsg
finish uni then understand financial management for yourself I can say good luck to you,btohqsg
cool. You work in Uni Engineering Lab?,btohqsg
but I only understand a bit after I finish unino wonder I gg 😭,btohqsg
unless you're earning so much money you don't need good financial management la then... I nothing to say,btohqsg
schools do a non existent job of financial literacy,btohqsg
get paid to goyang kaki in air cond lab. dream job.,btohqsg
Nah. My role is to ask students to sign attendance,btohqsg
sch is to burn students time so thay parents can work for Singapore Inc,btohqsg
But like. They also not coming for their own slot....,btohqsg
i'm a teaching assistant in an undergrad physics lab among my other roles lol,btohqsg
I would argue tuition does that equally well but I shall stop myself and go to sleep LOL,btohqsg
find a partner  settle down with a BTO early. Property prices still increasing,btohqsg
What's the median salary of Singaporean  and and how long to wait and price of a BTO?,btohqsg
I think 5k+? Forgot. Household income 10k+ to nearing 11k,btohqsg
1 student asked question till 1040pm. Then I settle my other student questions and some basic admin stuff till now,btohqsg
A level time. So many questions,btohqsg
"I still rmb someone ask me ""how to operate a multimeter""",btohqsg
Singaporeans still earn so low? Heard NTU/NUS Fresh Grads at MNCs already $5k.,btohqsg
uni grads are not the majorityb,btohqsg
"I did work as a ""curriculum development assistant"" at a private sch/tution before lol",btohqsg
I rmb one of the students just spilled like chemicals onto the paper,btohqsg
It was a sad moment 😪,btohqsg
I remember I dripped a drop of HCl or KMnO4 on my lab manual before  it literally crumble and chew through a hole.,btohqsg
Hopefully it isn't an actual exam paper for your student lol,btohqsg
The saddest moment was knowing from the other tutors that that same student attempted to cut before,btohqsg
It was more of a sample worksheet uh,btohqsg
Like you know those science practical lab intensive sessions,btohqsg
Anyone want si yan handwriting reveal,btohqsg
I have current SG Chief of Navy JC handwriting,btohqsg
"""to cut"" means inflict self harm / suicidal acts?",btohqsg
I remember staring at this and i completely have no idea whats going on,btohqsg
Cant show it in my face though,btohqsg
Si yan might just kill me,btohqsg
And i cant get over the fact he writes 》《 as X,btohqsg
that's a lot of people tho,btohqsg
there's only so much i can do tbh bc time is tight,btohqsg
