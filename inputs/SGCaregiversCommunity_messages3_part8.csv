Patient— shower at least once a day and use a gentle shampoo that does not sting the eyes  moisturize body with lotion  brush teeth twice a day  keep an eye for hair trimming and nail clipping (always trim nails straight across and not round like a semi circle to prevent breakage; trim after a shower when the nails are softer  if not  soak them in water for a few minutes and dry them first).Environment— change clothes and undergarments every day; if patient is on diaper  change diaper whenever necessary. Wash bedsheets once a week or more frequently if patient is bed bound and there are food crumbs  perspiration  hair strands on it.,btohqsg
Please have a look at this poster here  they offer help with personal hygiene,btohqsg
As best as possible  you should always as a caregiver encourage independence and routine in looking after their own personal care and hygiene. This can include printing out a clear routine of steps they need to take each day  as well as labeling their toiletries for them and keeping them in clear and accessible places where they know where to find them and reach for them easily.,btohqsg

Hi everyone! I have just discovered this group. I am e main caregiver of both elderly parents who have chronic illnesses.My helper is going back for a short break at e end of her contract. I am wondering if anyone has any recommendations on where I can find a temporary helper while she is away. Please advise. Thank you 🙏🏻,btohqsg
hi Norliza  not sure whats the level of care needs that your parents need  but if they are still mobile u can bring them to nearby Active Ageing Centres during the day time. if they needed more care support  hourly rated caregivers can be an option but they are extremely costly ($22sgd / hour and above).https://www.aic.sg/care-services/home-personal-care/,btohqsg
