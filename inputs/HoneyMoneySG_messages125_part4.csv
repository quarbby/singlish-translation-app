Anyway just do it while stocks last.From the looks of it the high savings accounts won’t last very much longer once us start cutting rates.,btohqsg
Hi what is maybank and friends card good for? I received it because I had to open a mortgage acc with maybank,btohqsg
One of the best cards in the market for 8% cashback on 5 selected categories + ringgit spend.,btohqsg
"Agreed. Enjoy while it last. Cant worry too much about things we cant control. Just keep a lookout for the next ""best deal"" every month.",btohqsg
Ok I shall look into it,btohqsg
Does anyone encounter problem whereby UOB Prvimiles Amex can't be store in Google pay wallet? It says this card can't be use for contacless. Is it true?,btohqsg
Does anyone still got to VICOM to pay for road tax using AMEX to get rewards?,btohqsg
I know Uob absolute Amex now excludes government.But any reason why u can’t use PayPal + Amex true cashback at one motoring ?,btohqsg
Oh that being said. Which card are u all having forparking.sgnow.Amex true cashback right?,btohqsg
Do you have UOB lady saving acct? If yes  it's auto linked so don't need to do anything. You can use any other method to pay for ur UOB lady cc bills  just do NOT touch UOB lady account.,btohqsg
Will it deduct from the savings or change as credit if it link?,btohqsg
Ur uob lady cc won't auto deduct from uob lady saving acct.,btohqsg
So if credit card linked to a savings account it won't deduct from savings  the link cc to savings is for ATM withdrawals convenience able to select on the screen is it correct?,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone has any ideas how to convert miles for Etihad Emirates and Qatar? Or which credit card to use to get miles for the big 3?,btohqsg
Hey is it weird to apply both the amex version and visa version of uob privmiles? So can get the benefit of both? I just read that Google pay wallet don't allow amex with uob so I must carry the card with me at all times if I ever need to use it,btohqsg
For SG issued cards  Citibank and HSBC for Qatar and Etihad  Amex for Emirates.,btohqsg
I see heymax listparking.sgas mcc 7523 though. Not excluded by Uob absolute Amex. Accurate?,btohqsg
Dobin also says UOB Absolute is eligible for 1.7%,btohqsg
Can share how do you maximise the benefits at 3.6% + 1% if you are using 2 human EGA accounts at the same time? Isn't it better to rotate every month to benefit from the 1% on incremental ADB?,btohqsg
If you do merry go round once every 2 months? Dont tell me like this will also kanna?,btohqsg
Hi just want to check my understandingFor bonus point that have spending cap like crmc 1k example if I spend 12.99  it will based on 12 not 12.99 right ? Since that award the points for every 1$If dbs wmcc 1.5k cap and 10dbs point for every 5$ spend means if I spend $12 it will take $10 instead of $12 right ?,btohqsg
Still waiting... maybe by Monday will be settled,btohqsg
What u are saying in your latter is what I’m doing.,btohqsg
What's this from OCBC ? Can't find anything on it.,btohqsg
Do you see the $0 transaction for fee waiver?,btohqsg
Hi what r some of the best cards for big ticket purchase for courts. >$10k etc. they allow spilt payment. Checked dobin  most are the 1.xx miles card except maybe krisfly uob (3miles   spend $800 at SIA),btohqsg
Oh I just checked  they refunded liao.  Happy happy happy 😊,btohqsg
Yes. Uni$ have been added back to the pool but u cannot see any adjustment entry in the app. Heard statement will have. But it’s all good.,btohqsg
Anyone managed to get the cashback,btohqsg
The cashback appears immediately? What time did you buy?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i pair my Krisflyer uob with Amaze card  i will be able to use it at courts merchant and qualify its use as online shopping?,btohqsg
Hmm. I used at a few of the participating merchants but nothing appeared,btohqsg
ForUOB Lady's Solitaire Card  is the $2000 spending cap for calendar month or for statement month?,btohqsg
First question to ask is what mcc does the online shopping cover? Does courts merchant mcc fit into the whitelist? Use heymax to check the mcc. You probably won’t get the fittingmcc.nextalternative to buy voucher from heymax to fit into 5311,btohqsg
Fraud dept just called after 37 hrs of wait. It's not the due diligence dept. They just want to make sure I am not being tricked/cheated into making payment to 3rd parties. I told them to call quicker in future n to whitelist moomoo Singapore. I also feedback I tried many time to setup egiro for hsbc but don't work.,btohqsg

I need some advice! my insurance policy is due on 29 each month and its usually take about two days for the transaction to get posted. For this month; 29 falls on a Thursday and 30th is a Friday and also Teacher day. Do you think the transaction will get posted by 31 Aug? I thinking whether I should spend extra on UOB cards to quality the $500 spending requirements 🧐,btohqsg

Sorry if this is a noob question.I am thinking of getting Citi rewards card + Instarem.Since Citi rewards exclude mobile wallet transaction for 10x points. What about mobile wallet transactions using instarem that link to Citi reward? Will it get 10x point?,btohqsg
Amaze helps by-pass that by turning the transaction into an online one so you will get the 4mpd.,btohqsg
"may I check what is the ""creditable account"" mean in Maybank card application?",btohqsg
