That‚Äôs rational reasoning  changed my vote to Save üòÖ,btohqsg
Many property contractors anyhow set price 1,btohqsg
Example 5 room porcelain flooring tiles cost price only $800 but set at $10000,btohqsg
I don't do tiling works for hdb. Usually for cost price is set according to how many m2 the dimensions of the floor plan. They have other materials to be included and workmanship prices.,btohqsg
They use bangala lo. $20 a Day. Equipment already have,btohqsg
And maybe only earn up to 50cents profits per square feet.,btohqsg
Maybe u wanna try join e bto chat to promote ur services instead?,btohqsg
Or go join e reno chat,btohqsg
I bought the tiles from taobao at $500 n DIY,btohqsg
Actually to be honest India or bangala they do have extra cost like work permit and dormitory. Extra expenses which consumers don't add in.,btohqsg
True also but you see a point that you're doing and hand on yourself??,btohqsg
Wah Lao can save 10k why not,btohqsg
Yes Jim you are saving a cost for that but actually this prices are all mark up by ID firms.,btohqsg
Actually we do differentiate the skills and non skills worker.,btohqsg
I don't want contactors to leech so much from me,btohqsg
My workers after add on per day roughly 80-100dollars.,btohqsg
From light to floor all can DIY,btohqsg
I have 72 workers working for me. Actually doing job like construction line not enough.,btohqsg
If I really donno how  I will look for a bangala do. Skip the middleman contractor,btohqsg
Alot consumers compare price between few contractors actually and goes for the most reasonable one,btohqsg
They either stupid or lazy. Can save so much if diy,btohqsg
Worse case is just find a bangala do directly,btohqsg
U know why tiles usually laid by Chinese workers and not bangla unskilled workers. It‚Äôs because tiles laying not simple. For aesthetic  u need to keep the gap small and thin. Definitely not doable for new guysAnd worse is poppingIf you don‚Äôt do it properly  after one year or so  the tiles will just pop up suddenly and breakTo repair that one tile  u may have to damage surrounding tiles,btohqsg
Bathroom renovation most expensive coz of waterproofing2nd should be carpentry work because skilled workers more expensive3rd I think is tiles ba,btohqsg
Usually for waterproofing we look at the conditions first.,btohqsg
Actually for me I still think local and Malaysian workers are more skillful on laid tiles.,btohqsg
Some are good some with poor workmanship.,btohqsg
Certainly have revision de  unhappy within 2 weeks normally can rectify,btohqsg
Actually is see their workmanship. Good or bad only.,btohqsg
Cause for bto HDB had materials criteria like last time we use Sands and cement now hdb want all to use premix cement and it is very hard and easily dry therefore alot ID firm prices goes up to $14.50-$15.50/psf due to materials cost went up.,btohqsg
this is costly to homeowners and no guarantee will be good worksmanship like you mentioned,btohqsg
Hdb change the criteria and I know it is costly to homeowners and consumers plus the gst really cost you a bomb,btohqsg
Good workmanship also hard to find,btohqsg
Alot customer choosing vinyl flooring nowadays,btohqsg
Actually this premix cement had changed few years back.,btohqsg
Yeah really depend to homeowners what they want theirs house to be like,btohqsg
Cheaper than lay tiles. If it fit your house design but for long run usually for me personally I will choose homogeneous tiles more easily to maintain and lasting.,btohqsg
Lasting depends on personal maintenance  vinyl looks nice just needed more careful attention to details,btohqsg
Just a advise don't use vinyl at kitchen,btohqsg
For me I am specialise in getting leads for my customers,btohqsg
What kind of produces? Veggies? Fruits?,btohqsg
üòÇ You want what kind also will receive,btohqsg
Is not produces is products okay!,btohqsg
