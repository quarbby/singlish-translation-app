STA isn't the best pre purchase inspection anyway  it's just a judge of road worthiness not actual condition of the car,btohqsg
But they do have pre purchase inspection n will grade the car,btohqsg
Those looking for these stickers can look for@rocketbunnyneohere!,btohqsg
They don't have the skillset or experience to check for specific issues with specific cars that a specialist might have,btohqsg
There is literally no best one  every ws inspecting will have flaws of their own.,btohqsg
I didn't say there's no flaws with the others,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just saying in general bro,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a AMG iirc hahahah,btohqsg
9119 change few cars already. Used to be a Gallardo  Swiss pork and E class,btohqsg

Anyone got car wanna sell üëçhttps://telegra.ph/Instincts-Motoring-04-02,btohqsg
Hello  thanks Im looking for pic,btohqsg
Sell to this type of people we sure get low prices,btohqsg
You have experiences with their service?,btohqsg
Then which type of people give high price?,btohqsg
I will pretty much agree if you were to sell your car directly to any dealer including us‚Ä¶ the price will be much lower as there is risk involved if the car don‚Äôt sellWe normally will advise to consign instead and we charge a transparent fee to help facilitate the sale of your vehicle‚Ä¢ photoshoot (will send it to you for keepsake)‚Ä¢ Marketing your car‚Ä¢ administrative work‚Ä¢ handling interested buyerAlternatively you can take your time to try and sell yourself‚Ä¶. It will be a good and fun experience to learn.Have fun üòä,btohqsg
Still waiting to know which type of ppl give high price üòÇ,btohqsg
When u buy at low COE and sell at High COE that is when u get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù priceOr your car is unique like maybe u can fetch a nice price which I do know such cases#hewhoshallnotbenamed,btohqsg
Is actually waiting for that feller to say la,btohqsg
His concern is valid‚Ä¶ there is some methods out there that causes such concern,btohqsg
Or he could also be a dealer,btohqsg
Sell direct to dealer high chance get low price. Sometimes rental company also.,btohqsg
And then they fake the mileage n sell to others,btohqsg
U got a serious bad experience bro haha,btohqsg
So u bought a fake mileage car?,btohqsg
Maybe someone just change the speedo with a different mileage and then sell the car??,btohqsg
That's why there's this thing call PPI,btohqsg

@rng123456I also share your concern. This car  for instance  got 2 owners but 36k mileage. Dealer will definitely say they don't drive much. We cannot always take their word for it unless we ask the owners directly,btohqsg
Bro this one anyone can do... Don't need to be dealer üòÇ,btohqsg
Whats the link 2 owners but 36k mileage,btohqsg
My mom's car 1st gen vezel so Abt 6 years plus less then 50k. But because the car only goes from geylang east to ubi and back,btohqsg
I see where u get ur habits,btohqsg
But my car sadly going to 300k üòÇ,btohqsg
All the wfh underutilized cars hahah,btohqsg
That's why i said  nobody knows unless we ask the owner directly how they use the car or send for PPI. Salesman  whether car or any products  will always paint a positive picture to customer.,btohqsg
