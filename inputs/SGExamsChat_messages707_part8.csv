Because some students want to take poa/mob,btohqsg
then why other jcs dont have sia,btohqsg
But then moe really shouldn’t have removed it from all Jcs,btohqsg
Iinw all JCs used to have  but around 2003 removed,btohqsg
The way JCs been afaik alw been sci arts,btohqsg
Then only the 3 year institutes would have,btohqsg
Ngl I would prefer MOB over geog,btohqsg
i havent even developed into an embryo yet,btohqsg
The syllabus doc seems more similar to econs,btohqsg
Wait U took As what year ah,btohqsg
It could be earlier  I just estimating from what my sec sch Econs Cher told me,btohqsg
She said sth like she was the last batch to have commerce in jc,btohqsg
for chicha its always a fixed order of green milk tea + sakura konjac jelly 0% sugarfor other shops its prob either matcha (if they have) or green tea no milk + brown sugar pearlsbut i dont even drink other bbt that much anymore,btohqsg
I took too much of a nap alrd,btohqsg
I think if moe lets at least 2 JCs have a commerce stream there would be sufficient demand,btohqsg
Hypothetically if they made at least 2 JCs offer commerce stream,btohqsg
I really wish I could’ve done MOB,btohqsg
Like if Moe let at least 2 JCs,btohqsg
It’s an a level commerce stream subject,btohqsg
Poa is the one commonly offered to combi sci or Na students,btohqsg

On 26 July 2003  decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity.[2] This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes  and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities  thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result  Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004.,btohqsg
I nvr rly think wah shit if only can go >240 sch,btohqsg
Realised it doesn't rly matter anym kinda fast,btohqsg

the only reason im quote on quote venting about this is because im very done with my friends elitism lol,btohqsg
Wth. The past is the past. Not like IP students have some massive advantage and only they can get 90rp,btohqsg
They unironically got an advantage in the sense of,btohqsg
They deal w practical skills more,btohqsg
not a jc because of the 3 year programme,btohqsg
no offence but is it like he salty he cant make friends with the ip ppl,btohqsg
cause i honestly feel like most ppl dont wanna befriend ppl with this kind of attitudes,btohqsg
its not even an ip or not thing,btohqsg
wah thats a good pov sia,btohqsg
Have you made any jae friends tho,btohqsg
cause i feel like the fact that he says such things you mentioned  it shows that he generally looks down on others,btohqsg
no point trying to psychoanalyse someone like that,btohqsg
in fact it is called CI (centralised institute),btohqsg
and then ppl dont really wanna befriend this kind of ppl,btohqsg
I thought the jaeip divide is bigger in dhs since it only accepted jae students more recently,btohqsg
u think i was joking the whole time ah,btohqsg
