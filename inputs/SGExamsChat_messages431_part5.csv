I see you on the street i purposely go ask you for your ic,btohqsg
They gonna make friends with u first,btohqsg
Bruh. I went there 2 times. Old & new compound.,btohqsg
What did I ever do to you pocoyo,btohqsg
That â€˜s true. They still on my Insta tho.,btohqsg
But the ones Iâ€™ve met never forced me into joining.,btohqsg
I guess the later batches do things diff,btohqsg
Everyone gonna do their own way,btohqsg
Cuz I met them while working pt. U know they are more than jst a church.,btohqsg
Ya. The pastor is the owner. Is a legitimate fam Biz. If you â€˜ve heard of Marshall   Klipsch & Sonos   that â€˜s them.,btohqsg
I was guesing which brand and i actually guess it,btohqsg
No wonder those brands always have young people working for them and those thay go to that church,btohqsg
Their part timer also join their meeting,btohqsg
I mean their products are not bad.,btohqsg
Honestly why part timer need to join sia,btohqsg
Only followers can join them for part/full-time.,btohqsg
actuallyâ€¦I see the way I talk to you sometimes,btohqsg
ya Iâ€™m boring as fuck lmao,btohqsg
Is like one of the perks. ig.,btohqsg
But when a job is related to religion,btohqsg
Erm i find it not a nice thing,btohqsg
To us   that â€˜s how we feel. But to them   it may be otherwise.,btohqsg
That is true. As in they are not the owner of those brands but more of distributing.,btohqsg
Correct. They canâ€™t offer the same kind of service that Sonos themselves offer like try risk free for few days that type.,btohqsg
Hmmm.. I donâ€™t think Sonos is 400% markup tho from the local distri. Shld be abt 20%.,btohqsg
quite a lot of people feel it's a cult  they attract alot of teenagers  was checking out their google and saw this comparison,btohqsg
That â€˜s true. But why is theMap in Russian tho?,btohqsg
But the rating is 4.8. So good huh?,btohqsg
they probably ask their members to leave reviews or something,btohqsg
Same for this. Where else can you find a shop with full of 5 star reviews here.,btohqsg
could be they delete those? I've heard of it,btohqsg
or the whole 2.9k is they oneself give review,btohqsg
or those schemes where they pay ppl to give fake review,btohqsg
i dont think you can remove reviews,btohqsg
was a article on mothership/cna about this,btohqsg
if not everyone would remove negative reviews for their own benefit,btohqsg
Hmmmm. No one knows for sure.,btohqsg
You can only request Google to delete a review if it violates their policy,btohqsg
