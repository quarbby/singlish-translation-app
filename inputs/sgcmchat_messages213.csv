Saw one just now... Malaysia plate,btohqsg

Stopped to check my dad car,btohqsg
Got one sirroco damn loud just now I think come here to catch,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt come out if car illegal haha,btohqsg
The real W124 500E was only available in LHD,btohqsg
well yes  but not entirely true,btohqsg
there were a very small handful of rhd units,btohqsg
And it has wider wheel arches,btohqsg
i believe colour matched trim pieces too.,btohqsg
For your info there were rhd e500 and 500e that has been converted which require complex change in converting left-hand drive W124 to right-hand drive would involve major changes to the steering column  dashboard  pedals  wiring loom  and potentially even the body panels  making it a very costly and complex. There were few units in Malaysia bought from uk...,btohqsg
Anyway that example just now didn't look like a real 500E,btohqsg
They look like normal W124 wheel arches,btohqsg
300e m103 ((the hammer) 500e  (the wolf) and e420 and e36 - 24v will have wider front(build by daimler mercedes)E500 by porsche will have wider front and rear.,btohqsg
It's a base model with a kit and poorly sized badges,btohqsg
