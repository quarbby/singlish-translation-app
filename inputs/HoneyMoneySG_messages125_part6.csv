Use credit cards I guess. Or can buy klook vouchers from heymax for even more miles.,btohqsg
Tried using HSBC Live+ to buy vouchers but it comes out with this error‚Ä¶ anyone know what‚Äôs wrong? I did not even get an OTP notif on my HSBC app,btohqsg
Can use a credit card that rewards for MCC 5311 and buy klook gift cards onhttps://hmsg.link/heymax  then utilise the gift cards on klook,btohqsg

Hi 5812 can use for food delivery,btohqsg

Usually mcc really depends on how the entity registered their business. Deliveroo is 5812 while foodpand 5499 and grab food 5814. :),btohqsg
Yeah but hsbc live + 5812 can use for grap food that‚Äôs why,btohqsg
Hi  to register for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme  I recently did this:1. Transferred $2000 to my HSBC account from my OCBC 360 account - Must this be GIRO?2. Completed 5 transactions (I did 5 x $2 FAST transfers to my OCBC 360 account) - Can this be PayNow transaction and is any amount fine?I did not register for July promotion and have yet to receive the August promotion qualifying SMS. When should I receive the qualifying SMS after sending registration SMS?,btohqsg
Hi  for Maybank Platinum Visa  if I received cashback this July is this deducted from my eligible spend for July? Ex. I want to hit $300 min spend but got $33 cashback  does that mean I have to spend $300 or $300+33? Thanks!,btohqsg

Does paying for great eastern insurance via ocbc credit counts towards the $500  spending criteria? (Idc about getting any cashback from the card itself),btohqsg
Just buy the giftcard from lazada and use them as credits,btohqsg
You can just tell OP what it is  without linking to them.,btohqsg

How does everyone go about redeeming miles? Do you have an aggregator to search for flights redeemable by miles across the different airlines or just use SingaporeAirlines? TIA,btohqsg
Beginner level like me will use krisflyer first Loh.Familiar Liao then move out to other ffp,btohqsg
For UOB Krisflyer card with Kris+ purchase cards  miles are credited every 4th of the months am I right? Todays miles still not in yet tho,btohqsg

If you guys were in your 20s with savings of 5 digits on the lower side  have very little knowledge regarding finances and are keen to maximise your savings and wealth  what would the steps you guys taktakee to,btohqsg
Set aside money for housing and education  the rest wait for crash then all in into nasdaq,btohqsg
1) set up an account with ocbc 360 or uob one account if you‚Äôre working  rack up side gains from the interest as a long term ongoing thing and save as much as you can for the first couple of years2) after 2-3 years  start dca-ing monthly just few hundred into an s&p 500 or nasdaq etf.. and then really hope that both indexes can really maintain 10-12% cagr growth,btohqsg
I am new to all this. I've been working ft for the past year and so. Just accumulated low 5 digits savings. I thought it was time for me to upgrade my finances. Thank you for the advice. Anything else i should read up on or anything else to take note of?,btohqsg
This playlist of Chris' videos might be helpful.https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY9HGoedVpsOOAkRZ4lOOPlsm6TVpJ2OGDon't need to watch everything  do pick those that are relevant for you right now.,btohqsg
I have to admit  i am also not the most in the know of the fundamentals that may / may not drive each individual company and such and their respective stocks.But that is why a broader market index etf can help newer and even intermediate investors get exposure in the market.. the longer term growth of these two highlighted indices are also aligned with the long term of us economyAnd then down the road you can look at how your spending / credit card strategy can help support your lifestyle‚Ä¶ but i guess one step at a time!,btohqsg
If i have canceled citipayall instruction  understand this will still consumed my citipayall monthly limit. Will this limit be 'returned' and reset after few days? Anyone know? Thanks!,btohqsg
