What's the difference between webull  moomoo trading compared to Philip  DBS  Stanchartered  Lim and tan? When we buy stocks from webull and moomoo  will our sg stocks be showed inside the cdp? If our stocks are showed in cdp  can we sell them via webull and moomoo? I called cdp and I was told that the sg stocks that are seen inside cdp has to transfer out. I was told that cdp is just a holding place so need to transfer out if want to sell via webull or moomoo? But no need if sell through Philip  DBS  stanchart or lim and tan?? What is the logic?,btohqsg
