the amount tat was involved for mine  can place a new car deposit liao leh,btohqsg
Ya this also  so many times see commercial vehicle hogging expressway lane 1 the TP ride past never care,btohqsg

Comfort nt gg to help uncle chase for injury comp,btohqsg
Not sure about that. Taxi companies very aggressive,btohqsg
Too many foreign drivers for commercial vehicles that drive like back in their country,btohqsg
They have a good legal team to do the claims. I personally know taxi drivers that the other party refuse to report also in the end the taxi driver still get paid holiday,btohqsg

True also but they tend to rear end you cos their brakes cannot make it  at least not at that speed with load.,btohqsg

Actually the lane 2 hoggers would normally be on lane 3 but the lorries move from 4 to 3 so push them to 2,btohqsg
Don't know why SAF have no move timing yet these commercial vehicles that are the same size don't,btohqsg
End up return taxi. And we didnt bother to pay excess,btohqsg

You lucky you know the company's No1 then,btohqsg
Can lorries with those speed limit labels travel on lane 2?,btohqsg
Law not clear except keep left unless overtaking  and slow vehicles keep left  so lorries all go lane 2 and cruise there. Many join expressway already chiong to lane 2 and hog,btohqsg
