text,group
and went with it into exams,btohqsg
like eg to help mark papers,btohqsg
i think one of the lecturer actually initiated a school wide stats,btohqsg
Ohh but ngl doesn't it have to do w the way it's being taught too?,btohqsg
p sure they'll want people that get at least A- but realistically it's gonna be A since they don't need that many people for it,btohqsg
the module it literally called stats for engineering,btohqsg
oh so the people all marking my assignments and all that,btohqsg
at least got A for the particular mods,btohqsg
U guys have helpers? Mines just part time Assistants gotta either be student research assistant.. TA is left to grad students,btohqsg
but then again BME is diff from ME,btohqsg
den its a NP thing i guess,btohqsg
i know eee club has a subcomm that deals with this. they want ppl with min A,btohqsg
ya fr at most class part 0 only,btohqsg
within your assessment criteria  they can only touch class part for that or if they specify attendance as part of it,btohqsg
Like ngl the Prof has almost dictator power on the mod,btohqsg
they can't touch anything objective like quizes and tests,btohqsg
i mean it's a fair system,btohqsg
the prof gives 10% to class part. if you don't want then ok lor,btohqsg
wtf nobody turning up for that shit,btohqsg
den year 3 used to have another stats module called six sigma,btohqsg
that's what time i gotta be on campus this friday lol for invigilation,btohqsg
wait what am i invigilating shit,btohqsg
Bruh also speaking about South spine is the lines for food getting longer,btohqsg
nah i use it to clear some TA hours,btohqsg
do you get moolah from invigilating,btohqsg
Idk there's nothing else to eat and I got classes in 30 mins,btohqsg
I take their chilli oil mian,btohqsg
Ikr I liked the subway cuz rarely got queue,btohqsg
I can go in go out,btohqsg
TA and invigilating is part of my scholarship terms,btohqsg
no like genuinely it gets damn gelat after a few bites,btohqsg
need to clear 200 hours or smth by end of my phd,btohqsg
i p much never eat on campus nowadays,btohqsg
show up for meeting then fuck off,btohqsg
They closed down the KFC tho,btohqsg
and idk my friend keeps wanting to eat there,btohqsg
i just get the mashed potatoes from popeyes tbh,btohqsg

oh yeah i forgot kfc price is 15% lower in schools but i think outside kfc 2 pc is around $10 liao,btohqsg
god damn popeyes no student discount,btohqsg
I wish there was a student price for uni students,btohqsg
The one student which has the highest fees they don't give any leeway,btohqsg
it's ok get used to the adult life,btohqsg
i have to first get used to the fact im already an adult,btohqsg
except for the job and the bills part yet lmao,btohqsg
walao let me earn my first actual paycheck first then charge me adult fares lol,btohqsg
adult prices is the start of the things you'll have to pay for,btohqsg
Can at least allow me to get a decent CPF balance first pls,btohqsg
ik people who alr 30+ still flashing uni student card lol,btohqsg
shhh dont expose my future plans,btohqsg
i look the same whether when i was 18 or now anyway  30 probably still look the same,btohqsg
i use my postgrad matric card and will keep doing it till i grad at 29,btohqsg
oh yeah actually i think last fare revision they cut the undergrad monthly hybrid concession fare and it's now $81,btohqsg
Haven't even gotten my first stimulus cash from government yet,btohqsg
man can't even get those concession fares now :(,btohqsg
I still using my poly card for bus and movies,btohqsg
oh yeah i alr started to get since 2022 lol,btohqsg
I think my bus concession pass is,btohqsg

Remember 90 RP shave head arh,btohqsg
I don't even plan to discuss or wtv,btohqsg
With the bald head or the Admission first?,btohqsg
then be the top 1% la,btohqsg
val you want kuro treat you food right,btohqsg
85 I alrd gonna go bald,btohqsg
i alr promise a lot of people to treat them if they get 90 rp sia,btohqsg
Skill issue tbh.OP you deserved it since you had TWO YEARS to prepare for A LEVELS and yet you decided to not do anything about it.You didn't study hard enough. You didn't evaluate and improve upon your study methods. You didn't seek help early and go tuition if needed. You didn't attempt to fix your mental health issues (READ: Mental health issues don't exist  it's just in your head and you're simply weak minded). You didn't do many things you could've done. Now just bear the consequences of shitty results.After all  not many people get 85+ RP.To all future JC students:Pls fucking study as hard as you can don't fucking have any fuckshit excuses like mental health (the only time to ever pull that card is in the SAF) and all that friendship problems. Just fucking study smart and hard and ignore everything else you will get 85+ RP trust me.so u don't end up one week before prelims questioning what the fuck have u done for the past year,btohqsg
ok val see your pw first,btohqsg
I wouldn't be that surprised if I kena PW B eh.,btohqsg
But must hope for the best,btohqsg
oh no then your treat gone,btohqsg
thing is like your courses of interest don't really need a super high rp right,btohqsg
Eh she say one siol OK we should wait for her head to become a beacon of light for passing ships,btohqsg
I don't think my geog will be an issue.,btohqsg
meanwhile my mentee want go nus cs so 💀,btohqsg
Bro u had to stoop that low,btohqsg
i mean she say either cs or life science,btohqsg
life science not as high but still q high,btohqsg
Need ard how many RP ah,btohqsg
Should be under CHS isn't it?,btohqsg
i mean there's always ntu still,btohqsg
Bro FR said I'm doing it for the plot,btohqsg
i might have gone nus for phd but,btohqsg
i missed the app deadline for the scholarship LOL,btohqsg
my year dn but now need,btohqsg
it's like SAT but for postgrad admissions,btohqsg
my prof and his nus collaborator were complaining about how the gre req was stupid,btohqsg
when even us unis are moving away from it,btohqsg
nus decides to make it compulsory,btohqsg
A decent chunk of the grad students in NTU is cuz they lazy do GRE,btohqsg
i mean end of the day where you get the phd from isn't that important,btohqsg
Yeah then again tho for SOH ideally if you want a job in academia need to have overseas experience tho,btohqsg
All my Profs at least have 1 if not all qualifications from overseas,btohqsg
first time im coming to this sub for genuine help,btohqsg
anyone in 4NA THIS YEAR OR LAST YEAR,btohqsg
Urr my sis is this yr does it count,btohqsg
the big sister can become the alarm clock you know,btohqsg
She's so annoyed by the ring tone,btohqsg
next time set your ringtone to her fav song,btohqsg
I have PTSD from Samsung over the horizon tone,btohqsg
back in sec school  one of my friends thought it would be to troll with a teacher during a class exam,btohqsg
"he played one of those vids where its a min+ of silence followed by one single ""beep""..and its a loop",btohqsg
this is like an unwritten rule within sg unis,btohqsg
unless your publication record is insanely good,btohqsg
when the teacher heard it..and continue to hear it  you could see the teacher was getting more flustered every beep he heard,btohqsg
Yeah but I mean at that extent it just a path of least resistance to just do like a postgrad diploma or some professional qualification overseas to just fulfil that rule,btohqsg
most just do a stint of postdoc but yea,btohqsg
Yeah either MA or PhD at a foreign institution,btohqsg
I had a old woman use this as a ring tone in the bus and when that played I just frozed,btohqsg
Something instinctively told me to just not move,btohqsg
nice sia but they came from a generation of military people that is diff from today..whole career dedicate to military  also quite impressive,btohqsg
no resources for what i need tho,btohqsg
tbh prof is like stressful but also nice life,btohqsg
their era is u find a company  work to u retire,btohqsg
Google Drive  Microsoft  Whatsapp  Gmail  Outlook  Zoom and Dropbox,btohqsg
their pay is onpar with their last draw salary iirc,btohqsg
yea my uncle was one of the last batches where he could sign on their whole career,btohqsg
unless they specifically find and teach here  den the sch can lowball them,btohqsg
i think just being attached to saf is a minus for me alr,btohqsg
i know one lecturer earning 13k per month  teach a few module  no stress type,btohqsg
airforce mechanic i believe for the last 40+ yrs  his wife also airforce retiree,btohqsg
make sense la coz got work exp,btohqsg
u can try search their names in linkedin,btohqsg
i saw one of my lecturer in poly  man is doing research and publishing papers like free,btohqsg
assistant profs are paid about 8-10k a month,btohqsg
without whatever add ons depending on experience or other appointments held,btohqsg
assoc prof: 10 to 15kfull prof: up to more than 20k,btohqsg
Tbh once u get tenure the job security from that just means its on autopilot lmao,btohqsg
This one got called fake tho,btohqsg
yea and the numbers i give can vary a lot by uni and faculty,btohqsg
and if you're very well accomplished you could get more than 15k a month right off the bat,btohqsg
actually what would be the minimum requirement for tenure,btohqsg
number of research published? Number of years worked?,btohqsg
I asked a few Profs it depends tbh mainly on vacancies lmao,btohqsg
U gotta wait until enough profs retire die or resign and be an assistant Prof then,btohqsg
And then u can apply in which those would be important,btohqsg
In short: having he right connection and being good in your field,btohqsg
Somtimes luck also  just nice got prof gonna retire and the dude below him got promoted and u take his position,btohqsg
there's a reason why so few phd holders actually become faculty,btohqsg
most of them start their phds wanting to be one,btohqsg
best to start a phd with the understanding that one will have to do smth else afterwards,btohqsg
that's why it comes down to networking both within and outside academia,btohqsg
Age and wisdom shines through everywhere,btohqsg
Ah yes that's when you know either a old uncle or auntie is nearby,btohqsg
I set this to my first sim  then second sim I set to baby waltz,btohqsg
who are you and why are you in my dms lmao 🤡🤡,btohqsg
What about Stalford and those self owned tuition centre that teaches only one subject ?,btohqsg
and idek if stalford is good or not,btohqsg
when you attract students by saying youll give freebies and discounts or something,btohqsg
Like Former MOE Economics Teacher Opens Center to teach only Economics,btohqsg
when i went for one of zeniths trials at the end the teacher was just saying that sign up for 1 subject  get free airpods or something,btohqsg
seems like those not welfare loses out,btohqsg
Back to School Day 1 🎉,btohqsg
Im using telegram in class AMA,btohqsg
NUS CS is ~ > 87.5rp safestNUS life science: i dun really know chs works,btohqsg
I hv a friend who freaking got her 5th choice in nus fled to ntu lmao,btohqsg
What were her choices and rp?,btohqsg
I think her choices were mainly in FASS tho but she got english lmao,btohqsg
I didnt really dare ask my friends how much i did after my friend just took my results slip and announced to the whole class omo,btohqsg
If pharmacy ppl can enter w 82 (i really dk how)  life science wun exceed pharmacy cut off,btohqsg
nus deadline for phd app is two months before ntu,btohqsg
wait you said you nvr finished a tutorial while in jc right,btohqsg
today the math teacher scolded him for not doing tutorials 💀,btohqsg
i used to just do a bit or “refer” to others to not get scolded lol,btohqsg
Oh that’s rough I didn’t think FASS was that competitive,btohqsg
i did the tutorial while she yapping cause she usually yap for like 10min before going through,btohqsg
Bro go back to studying lol,btohqsg
What class is it for you right neow,btohqsg
in the app for CHS you’ve got two categories for majors: either “direct entry” ones where you immediately indicate what you want like pharm/food science etc or “common entry” where you just indicate humanities and sciences,btohqsg
so it doesn’t matter what major you’re going for if it’s under humanities and sciences,btohqsg
Wait was chs around during yr time,btohqsg
I’m thinking of buying a swastika red and white colour to represent SG flag,btohqsg
if you want nus physics you’re fighting with people also trying for chem bio english history wtv,btohqsg
And wear on my right hand cuz I use that to say SG pledge,btohqsg
then if you get into humanities and sciences under chs you can choose any major under chs for the first two years (as long as you meet the prereqs),btohqsg
nope it started when i started uni so after my ns,btohqsg
bros aren’t you in Sec 3,btohqsg
i’m doing a phd my guy,btohqsg
Wait was lee siew choo around in ur time,btohqsg
Everyone ik has smth bad to say about her,btohqsg
Are u doing phd in quantum physics,btohqsg
If she treat you like npc ur ok,btohqsg
quantum physics isn’t a branch for research. it’s a fundamental area,btohqsg
you have no clue what you’re talking about lol,btohqsg
your trolling is obnoxious and annoying,btohqsg
and not even a good one,btohqsg
What u think I learn here at sparkle tots,btohqsg
at least try to be funny bro,btohqsg
nothing considering the stuff you say here,btohqsg
I like trolls who are funny,btohqsg
Ya that’s why I k1 bah,btohqsg
But actually what branch of physics do you do,btohqsg
Even if dont meet can do bridging alr i think,btohqsg
So art stream can technically do the stem majors,btohqsg
So if someone takes full arts with h1 math they can do stem majors?,btohqsg
But if you wanna do a stem major,btohqsg
A glitch in the matrix I say,btohqsg
Why tf did u do arts stream,btohqsg
I’m asking a hypothetical question bro,btohqsg
Wait bro so how long is the bridging? Let’s say I do arts in JC with h1 math for 2 years. If I wanna do computer science in Uni as major how long is the bridging and actual course?,btohqsg
chs is a bit like the US system where you enter the uni first then declare major later,btohqsg
what bridging you need depends on the course you want la,btohqsg
Ohh but total how long would u need to spend in NUS,btohqsg
comp sci is under sch of computing,btohqsg
10th percentile IGP is 78.75rp and ABB/B,btohqsg
how about you look it up yourself,btohqsg
and even if it was under chs,btohqsg
with so many 90rp ppl with the subj prereqs applying for nus cs,btohqsg
why tf would they choose someone from arts stream,btohqsg
tbh i think chs just fucks up a lot of humans side that usually had a lower cutoff,btohqsg
If I get 83.75 I wonder what are my chances,btohqsg
Also I still don’t know whether business admin is better than chs,btohqsg
I think the pay is but idk if I’ll enjoy it as much,btohqsg
too many variables to know tbh,btohqsg
Bro my pay is 1 million dollars per hour 😎😎😎,btohqsg
i DONT work for Kim Jong Un,btohqsg
Oh well if I fail to get in I can retake my H1,btohqsg

When I try to @ others I can’t but I thought I saw others able to @,btohqsg
Oh so just have to manually type it out,btohqsg
One of my classmate got scolded today 😋😋,btohqsg
I thought as long as it does not appear in the search result means no tag,btohqsg
So ig all of us can lol,btohqsg
yeah but it doesn’t appear in the list anymore lol  that’s what he was referring to,btohqsg
Well now we know we can tag anyone here,btohqsg
ya la drop out to where,btohqsg
yeah but won’t appear in the list if you put @,btohqsg
I thought this was the case previously,btohqsg
Didn’t know manually typing out works,btohqsg
then why i type ur name it doesnt appear,btohqsg
yeah lor so type manually lor,btohqsg

"""i suffer before so u should suffer with me""",btohqsg

@habibi5201should i eat japanese stall or not,btohqsg
when was the last time u eat jap food,btohqsg
I mean i can eat the same thing everyday and not get sick of it,btohqsg

i feel like throwing up alot for no specific reasons,btohqsg
I alrd alm eat finish LMAO,btohqsg
its not bad but i prefer japanese,btohqsg
Then like that how is the igp gonna determine,btohqsg
igp only shows the grades entered for “humanities and sciences” for example,btohqsg
??? It started the year after me tho,btohqsg
oh misremembered but yea too late for me,btohqsg
but yea you see there’s “humanities and sciences” which is multiple diff courses while the specific ones like data science and econs are the direct entry ones,btohqsg
So there are 2 igp  like those who are direct entry and those common entry?,btohqsg
each direct entry has their own igp bc if you’re successful you’re just in that major,btohqsg
common entry is like a basket of diff majors that you decide later on,btohqsg
so you don’t get admission into the specific major yet,btohqsg
i think philosophy  politics  and economics is a different basket,btohqsg
while common entry dont need interview ?,btohqsg
ok yea humanities and sciences is the only common entry basket,btohqsg
knn cygnus shirt out of stock,btohqsg
Wait val you want ppe ?,btohqsg
anyway i just looked all this up like last night,btohqsg
to finally understand how this shit works,btohqsg
then now even got what first choice bonus,btohqsg
I went to look up chs,btohqsg
Heard that chs y1 is all fluff mods,btohqsg
All current Secondary Three students as well as students who will be Secondary Three in 2025 and studying in MOE institutions  will be invited to the 2024 and 2025 National Day Parade (NDP) National Education (NE) Shows respectively.These students were the Primary Five cohorts who were unable to attend the NE Shows in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions at the time.Between 20 and 21 Mar  parents of current Secondary Three MOE students will receive an invitation from the NDP 2024 Executive Committee via MOE’s Parents Gateway portal. Parents of students who will be Secondary Three in 2025 will receive their letters next year.- MINDEF,btohqsg
i mean every uni has a common curriculum,btohqsg
Ok it has 2 sides of the story…if u can enter humanities and sciences w a lower igp  if u do well enough u can opt for a major that u couldnt qualify for,btohqsg
once you’re in that humanities and sciences basket you can take any major within it at all if you’re willing to take bridging mods,btohqsg
Ppl in chs complaining abt stupid mods they are forced to take in y1,btohqsg
why do u think i wanna go government sector,btohqsg
nah sike there goes my saturdays :(,btohqsg
oh yea pharm is the exception for this lol even tho the app states pharm under chs,btohqsg
i didnt turn up for my ntu interview,btohqsg
"cuz i was like ""ukw im not gonna go thr anyways go the interview for what""",btohqsg
Govt hospitals are privatised already actually…they are now under MOHH,btohqsg
also cuz i got my uni placing BEFORE my a level results,btohqsg
wait senpai does ntu have the fluff mods,btohqsg
Actually it aint under chs  but phrm sci is,btohqsg
I heard pharmacy is its own thing,btohqsg
but pharm sci is a 90RP course filled with monkeys,btohqsg
wait i tot u say u havent choose yet,btohqsg
Not true but it can be competitive coz intake only 70,btohqsg
wait Andrea you in pharmacy not pharmsci right,btohqsg
oh as in between uas and nus,btohqsg
I actually am confused where did pharmacy go after CHS coz it is not under CHS,btohqsg
i only applied to nus geog,btohqsg
I want to go to hustlers university 🔥,btohqsg
cuz its like what if i didnt get in,btohqsg
I think pharmacy is a separate thing from CHS it ain't even in it,btohqsg
If I somehow can make it,btohqsg
no like the chs application sometimes puts pharm under it even tho it’s not,btohqsg
Yeah and food sci or wtv they’re separate,btohqsg
but in all the marketing materials it’s listed separately,btohqsg
FST is under CHS but separate course,btohqsg
The other CHS majors are all same rp  are they?,btohqsg
i'm gna steal my sis funpack when she gets hers,btohqsg
Precisely  like both were tgt under nus department of pharmacy (in FOS)  now 1/2 of it went to chs  the other 1/2 idk where it go,btohqsg
But like Pharm Sci is CHS tho just under a restricted major la,btohqsg
CHS is either- Humanities or sciences- Environmental Sciences- Pharmaceutical Sciences- DSA/DSE? I think- FST,btohqsg
Yeah this is what I meant I didn’t know the exact term,btohqsg
the humanities or sciences one is where theyre all same RP,btohqsg
Wb engineering with undeclared major are they all same rp also? Excluding the restricted ones ofc,btohqsg
archi and comp E not even in the same sch i think,btohqsg
Pharmacy is 95% clinical  pharm sci is a v broad course focusing of drug development  science behind the drugs etc  more for research i guess? And u hv flexibility to specialise in different areas etc. and only BPharm can get u the practicing license. (And i think pharm sci is bachelor of science),btohqsg
imagine if comp sci is under CHS,btohqsg
Tldr is probably pharm sci is finding and making the drugPharmacy is selling and dispensing the drugs,btohqsg
But pharm sci first cohort graduated in 2022  it is a very new course,btohqsg
So i hv coursemates into research but choose pharmacy over pharmaceutical science coz not trusting it as it is still relatively new,btohqsg
I said this as a joke before but who knows maybe in 2030 NUS makes all admissions a common one u just apply and choose majors later,btohqsg
This is a freaking huge misconception amongst the general public in singapore,btohqsg
I think reasonable that it is direct entry,btohqsg
My friend went to comp eng coz  she didnt make it to comp sci due to A level screw up,btohqsg
But im p sure trf u apply through ur a lvl score,btohqsg
I thought good CAP in y1 for the related CS mods means transfer?,btohqsg
did bedok leave or sum 💀,btohqsg
No transfer either ways u need to qualify using the original Alevel score,btohqsg
If your Y1 CAP is high its a plus and helps your standing when u bid for mods,btohqsg
transferring isn’t as clear cut as you think,btohqsg
communication between different faculties and schools is horrible LOL,btohqsg
The prof made me think it was ez,btohqsg
I used to think NTU was just one cohesive system and unit.. I don't think that anymore,btohqsg
NTU CS if I get in,btohqsg
Lmao even within CoHASS communication is terrible and there's no standardised system.,btohqsg
That one quite easy as it's under CoE,btohqsg
Actually atp not sure if I’ll even get into any comp courses so no point worrying,btohqsg
They might just put me in CHS for all I know XD,btohqsg
If u never declare major in your application for CHS it would be disadvantageous,btohqsg
So he can’t dox more stuff about you here,btohqsg
Yeah I didn’t why’s that tho,btohqsg
comp eng is under both college of engineering and sch of computing btw,btohqsg
got new college of computing and data sci,btohqsg
banking on a transfer in general is v iffy,btohqsg
gives me nyjc arts to sci stream vibes LOL,btohqsg
I mean comp eng isn’t horrible,btohqsg
But too generic that’s the issue,btohqsg
Like EE is better with hardware and CS better with software,btohqsg
You’re in the middle of that,btohqsg
comp eng is more flexible but it means you're competing with both ends,btohqsg
That one we don't know the competition yet tho,btohqsg
yea but knowing the landscape of cs  i'm assuming it's v high,btohqsg
Then again I look at the structure they doubled the ICC Requirements for those,btohqsg
Wb SMU’a cs is it any good,btohqsg
Yeah they have a crap ton of ICCs for those like 30+ almost 40 AUs worth of ICCs,btohqsg
i don’t think you’re shortchanged regardless of which CS course you go,btohqsg
Yeah that’s true  but I need the cert to work as a dev,btohqsg
just that the latter two have diff ways of teaching,btohqsg
Yeah^ tbh CS isn't so limited to just CS course.,btohqsg
i mean throughout the uni days you’re expected to have some github of projects,btohqsg
To some extent yeah  but now like everybody is hopping onto dev jobs so you’ll really need a computing cert to stand out  like pretty sure the top 75%ile EE grads are also doing dev roles or smth,btohqsg
i think their ICC here includes those non CC mods that are considered foundation core,btohqsg
