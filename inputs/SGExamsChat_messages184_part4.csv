The ones that make it to university,btohqsg
i heard so too before joinin uni,btohqsg
but from what i see so far  its not rly true,btohqsg
im genuinely not interested in most jc topics thou,btohqsg
Maybe that’s because your in an early year?,btohqsg
but dont let this discourage u from going uni,btohqsg
So you have yet to learn the deeper topics,btohqsg
cos poly students also havent learn the deeper topics yet,btohqsg
Frankly I’ll only go to a really good JC,btohqsg
any third tier ones are out of the question,btohqsg
basically bottom line is imo there's a bias towards jc students faring better overall,btohqsg
Because you’ll have to defeat the odds there,btohqsg
i was technically from a third-tier jc,btohqsg
That’s why I’ll probably go to polytechnic,btohqsg
Im gonna do much worse for os than prelims lol,btohqsg
I want to get 80+ RP if I go JC,btohqsg
Which is not gonna be feasible in third tier,btohqsg
so i dont get what u are saying,btohqsg
Why didn’t you go overseas to study?,btohqsg
plus local unis are paying me to study,btohqsg
90RP shouldn’t be too difficult to get one right,btohqsg
should be an instant get if u apply local,btohqsg
Does it affect my a level RP?,btohqsg
Ok then I actually have a chance,btohqsg
Huh then take chinese in jc for what?,btohqsg
it does if u are going for a MT related course and ur chinese is better than the next best subject,btohqsg
oh yeah shit have to take chinese in as,btohqsg
And his stupid belief that all should learn a second language,btohqsg
Mfw i looking for internships but not many available for BME,btohqsg
i dont think it should be abolished,btohqsg
Don’t tell me you fan boy LKY,btohqsg
Ye but I think students should be given an option,btohqsg
i think ive come to the wrong chat at wrong time,btohqsg
but i feel that certain things are in place for a reason,btohqsg
To decide which second language they take,btohqsg
We alr been bilingual for 10 to 11 years,btohqsg
but nobody will take it then,btohqsg
u will know why certain things are as such,btohqsg
You can choose  but you must have one,btohqsg
ahh right right and not just mother tongue,btohqsg
mother tongue is still impt tbh,btohqsg
does anyone know a thing or two abt alcohol bitters?,btohqsg
the funny thing is i have malay friends who take chinese  so i think u can actually choose ur mother tongue? to a certain extent,btohqsg
like what? theres orange bitters blah blah blah,btohqsg
I not even sure if i gg w bme anymor looking at 0 internships abailable,btohqsg
Were you the top scorer in your JC?,btohqsg
Its for diff kind of drinks,btohqsg
How is it possible to get higher than 90RP?,btohqsg
But gets toned down to 90,btohqsg
oh if i wanna make a drink i must get ___ bitter,btohqsg
