For those who are not taking any loan for the bto. How much down payment do they need when signing agreement ? TIA,btohqsg
Where the flat supply is less than 20 units and it is unable to meet the demand from first-timer families  only first timer families will be shortlisted within 100% of the flat supply.,btohqsg

Kim keat ripple.On BTOHQ says target completion is 01 june 2024.But HDB say will be ready 1st quarter 2025,btohqsg
Considering the options  wonder if I could take a small hdb or bank loan 100k or less. Any advice? Tks.,btohqsg
They emailed you to inform you on the 2025 date?,btohqsg
Have you done your HFE? It will show you the amount of grant you‚Äôre eligible for,btohqsg
Its was inform to me when i sign come down to pick the flat. got this from SBF,btohqsg
My friend same proj as you,btohqsg
but hdb wont give if too low the amount,btohqsg
Thanks. Which bank at the moment got the best package in the market? Newbie on theseüôÇ,btohqsg
Not sure u can engage a loan broker they filter for u which is best.,btohqsg
Can try contacting those mortgage specialists  they may have better offers,btohqsg
Mortgage master or red brick etc. not advertising for them,btohqsg
I see. So usually HDB timing is quite accurate lah.,btohqsg
Any groupchat for kim keat ripple? Cant seem to find one,btohqsg
Should be? They can give good estimation cause they have the most data points to measure from and they track it very well as it‚Äôs their job.,btohqsg
i tried never give 25k only,btohqsg
they say in the hfe its too low,btohqsg
@tpybtobraddellcaldecottfor the open groupseehttps://t.me/tpybtobraddellcaldecott/21765for details on how to get into the confirmed residents' group,btohqsg

Just to know more about PLH  is there MOP requirement for resale buyers in future?,btohqsg
any group for Farrer Park Fields BTO? TIA,btohqsg
Hi guys! If during HFE application  I didn't indicate proximity housing with child but indicated in the HDB application (and system validated it)  will I still be entitled for the grant? Hfe approved letter didn't indicate I am entitled to the grant as I didn't indicate in HFE application.,btohqsg

For heavily undersubscribed 1st timers btos  any news that the limit of 5% for 2nd timers be lifted or adjusted? If not  we‚Äôll see lots of balance of flats with 1st timers still hesitate to buy.,btohqsg
No news  also means they won‚Äôt adjust,btohqsg
Interesting to see a flood of SBF. As they still impose the limit for 2nd timers in these exercises.,btohqsg
Good for those who have more urgent housing needs then,btohqsg
From the look  2nd timers for plh btos are more genuine buyers as lots of restrictions. Younger 1st timers may prefer to bto with shorter mop and then upgrade.,btohqsg
But moving forward with the Plus and Prime flats might be difficult for them to do so,btohqsg
Hopefully hdb can balance the real buyers from flippers. The new ruling is encouraged but they need to analyse the figures to make a balance especially for genuine buyers.,btohqsg
Still waiting for Feb24 BTOs to be out & to applyNo news yet. Have to wait till CNY den ü•π,btohqsg
