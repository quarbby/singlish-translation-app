Should be 30k if not wrong,btohqsg
Soooo I guess now every month also evergrande?,btohqsg
Means market crash in oct  Nov  2022  2023 etc and so on?,btohqsg
Is it normal to see deduction of just $0.10 on Amaze card when we use for public transport? Is that how it is supposed to show?,btohqsg
The market already expected it not to pay.,btohqsg
Yes normal for simplygo. But the bigger question is  why are you not using revolut for 20% cashback!,btohqsg
Noted. Will take a look at revolut. Didn't want to have too many diff accounts initiallyðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Seems like axs don't allow grab mc again?,btohqsg
I never used on AXS though  what were you paying@Kennytkw94,btohqsg
I manage to pay last month,btohqsg
Try asking on the grabpay chat and see if others alsp have the same.problem,btohqsg
Able to use grabpay mc to pay for income tax via axs,btohqsg
Choose credit card  not debit card,btohqsg
Instinctively... I chose debit card for grabmc,btohqsg
Currently I'm paying via giro. If I just cancel the giro   will iras send me a letter to inform me that I have outstanding payments to be made?,btohqsg
You are paying monthly via giro?,btohqsg
If you use axs to pay instead  ahead of the monthly giro deductions  the remaining outstanding will be updated automatically,btohqsg
Haha at first I just set as giro so I don't have to track it,btohqsg
Anyway no grabrewards points if you pay for income tax with grab card,btohqsg
Then after that know of uob absolute topup to grab,btohqsg
So yea haha its still like 1.7% discount?,btohqsg
You pay for insurance also no grabrewards points right?,btohqsg
Anyone heard of the crypto pet game?,btohqsg
At least describe what's the game about instead of just throwing the registration/referral link?,btohqsg
Its a p2p game using usdt on the trc20 network. You will buy pets using usdt and do 5 actions this will increase in the value of your pet increasing 5%. You will be able to sell the pet after 12 hours. You will earn 3% while 2% is taken bu the company. You will only get the proceeds after buying another pet.,btohqsg
To me this is kinda high risk and not alot of information is out there,btohqsg
This^ ðŸ˜… hopefully the slide help,btohqsg
The slides literally states what i summarized.,btohqsg
More in-depth brief on how it works and how to play,btohqsg
If u have any questionson on how to play or get started feel free to drop me a pm. Will help to guide u,btohqsg
If you guys are comfortable in using USDT  can go ahead but im staying out. Also just a heads up to those interested  only put in what you can afford to lose.,btohqsg
The only DD you guys can do on this game is the slides he just shared. Information is not really available online.,btohqsg
Quite suprised by my YouTube community results so want to see if any difference here,btohqsg
Hi im curious and new to REITS investments. What are the better platforms to use to invest in reits? Thank you!!,btohqsg
You can refer to this video. I use interactive brokers personallyhttps://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg
Since the limiting factor for withdrawing early is the tax  if you can earn more than the 5% tax penalty while invested in SRS  would you cash out and invest outside maybe in 5-10 years?So you benefit from tax relief and donâ€™t lose the cash flow you invested in earlier which you can then use for other purposes,btohqsg
Not for me beause the purpose is to defer till age 62  for 50% tax charged. And also at that age when u have almost no income the tax bracket will favor you.Secondly  you would want your investments to grow over time instead of taking them out pre maturely. Unless you have exhausted your cash and cash equivalents   I don't see a major need to withdraw SRS,btohqsg
Okay icic thanksBtw how did you determine the amount to be invested? Based on percentage on your portfolio or just the maximum limit allowable? What were some considerations if you donâ€™t mind sharing haha,btohqsg
I started everything from a tax saving perspective  because I hate paying tax.So with CPF VCMA and RSTU SA  those formed my foundation first to reduce my tax assessable income. Since it has 4% interest too.Once my CPF is near max and cannot top up anymore  then I look at SRS to save tax  which Endowus and MoneyOwl come just in time with their low cost options.Ultimately  you may want to reduce your tax assessable income to a level that you don't mind paying tax to IRAS.,btohqsg
"Always start with a ""Why"" for a long term plan or strategy  then your ""How"" and ""What"" will just fit in place",btohqsg
Icic thanks for the advice! Hope I can max out my CPF too ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
