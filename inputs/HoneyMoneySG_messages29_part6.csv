Anyone here use HSBC Revolution as default card on FairPrice app to pay?Any issues so far?Coz I just linked my HSBC Revolution and made it the default payment card on my FairPrice app but for some reason  it keeps getting declined when I want to pay via the app.,btohqsg
I think would be coz it’s a retail spend. U can test spending at the bowling alley for a small amount then once the transaction is posted  call the bank to ask if the MCC code is eligible.,btohqsg
I recently used hsbc Revo few days ago via the fairprice app  no issues,btohqsg
Try paying via contactless next round to see if it's the card problem?,btohqsg
Ok thank u. I’ll check in with FairPrice. Coz I can spend on the card as usual so that means that there’s no issue with the card side,btohqsg
Okay I’ll ask them on the app tmr :),btohqsg

I linked Revolut and Ezlink cards to Amaze card. I think I cashed out the Ezlink balance this way as an iPhone user,btohqsg
uh  u understand what he asking?,btohqsg
Have you activated your physical card? Just guessing  may be all along you are using it on apple pay without activating the physical card. Happen to my friend before.,btohqsg
Oops sorry! I thought only one user one Amaze card link to 5 Mastercards? What same credit card? Even Prepaid Debit or Digital Debit also ok as long as it's MasterCard and not GrabPay MasterCard,btohqsg
Hi  yes u r right. I am using the virtual card and have not activated the physical card since I had not received it.Your friend faced the same issues using the virtual card?Ie when the virtual card is linked to apps like FairPrice and ShopBack  the transaction would be declined. But apps like Kris+ and FavePay works with the HSBC Revolution virtual card.,btohqsg
Yes.. Linking to apps only possible after phywcard is activated. Apple pay use a separate card no.,btohqsg
Thank u. The bank say the virtual card and physical card details is the same so once linked to apps/phone  don’t need to re-link again once the physical card arrives.I will activate the physical card when it arrives and I hope this will resolve the “transaction-decline-using-virtual-card” issue,btohqsg
Weird wwmc helpline said end of the following month to me. And also they said posted date not transaction date.,btohqsg
