Crypto continue to led by ETH and BTC.Vividthree getting harder to ignore.That last session with 10mil shares traded mainly at approx $0.040.Seems like players who collected then after the acquisition news and they might have make their move soon.DYODD. Safe price to get $0.035-$0.037 IMP which I feel is the base they should bounce off,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 13 Jan 2023🎉🎲Shinning starts on Nasdaq💎The latest CPI data showing inflation weakening boosts high hopes for the Fed to moderate its interest rate hikes. This is sufficient to send the Nasdaq to its 5th day of green. The CPI's latest reading of 6.5% on a yearly basis is a drop from its peak of 9% during the middle of 2022.Despite the welcoming data  Pika World continued to be cautious as many Fed members have articulated that the current inflation rate remained uncomfortably high  and investors may have pinned too much optimism on the pace at which such elevated inflation will fall off.📊Bond markets signalling a possible end to rate hike🎯On the flip side  we are seeing the bond market signalling the possible end to the rate hike cycle. For example  the 2-year Treasury yield  often seen as a guide of the Federal Funds Rate  dropped to around 4.12% from 4.2% after the data release. Likewise  the 10-year yield fell to 3.425% from 3.55%.There is a growing expectation that the Feb FOMC meeting will see Uncle Powell raising the interest rate by 0.25% instead of 0.5% and possibly pausing rate hikes further.Nonetheless  Fed President Bullard  contrary to his name  voiced hawkishness and raised the idea of the fund rate hitting 5%  which is an uncomfortable level. His comments were sufficient to send the Nasdaq at one point  evaporating all gains before the index swang back into green territory.📮What are our dishes today?📖At 11 pm  we will have the Michigan Consumer Sentiment for Jan. Usually; this data is not of great significance. However  recently  there has been growing attention given to it due to the worry about a hard economic landing. After all  a significant component of the US economy depends on consumer spending.It is 13 Jan  Friday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. A roller coaster but a green week thus far  Pika World wishes everyone a splendid and safe trading day ahead.,btohqsg
