Other than P  MOE has decided that from 2027  HODs  SSDs  Year Heads  Lead Teachers that have served 8 or more years in the same school to be rotated tooThe there will be shake-up to the overall leadership team in any given school,btohqsg
Tbh some students decide to appeal for advancement‚Ä¶then screwd in j2,btohqsg
It is even doing btr than YI,btohqsg
I mean what u expect tbvh without any change in perspective they are gonna still get the same grades,btohqsg
Everything is doing better than YI u hit rock bottom when u are below JP,btohqsg
But I am curious if there is any comparative study done against countries with 3-year secondary system,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if my knowledge is dated but these are the places I remember with 3-year secondary,btohqsg
If that person is 55 yo by then  he/she has an option not to be rotated,btohqsg
But otherwise  teacher cannot choose to not be rotated if moe choses to rotate them?,btohqsg
Will that mean they will be forced to go all ard singapore coz for instance jcs  are so scattered,btohqsg
imagine living in boon lay and being rotated to tmjc,btohqsg
The plan on how the rotation is to be done isn‚Äôt fixed yetThere are suggestions that rotation to be done within a clusterIn any case  I know of school leaders who stay all over Sg and are posted all over Sg too,btohqsg
Icic. she has to decide for herself lor,btohqsg
They assign teachers the same district in which they live in,btohqsg
Won't be east to West but can be east to North east that kind,btohqsg
My stupid bus‚Ä¶i either each at 7.15 or just just on the dot nd risk being late,btohqsg
But there are only that many Jcs,btohqsg
Even with 4-5 that's enough tbh they just rotate based on that,btohqsg
wah in this case i think she gonna stay till she retires,btohqsg
Maybe he just rlly likes TM. Maybe he wants to be in a school bedok once went to,btohqsg
this one would actually follow china‚Äôs school system because they have 3 years of Âàù‰∏≠ and 3 years of È´ò‰∏≠,btohqsg
don‚Äôt be surprised when a sec 4 kid learns jc2 stuff in china,btohqsg
they alr graduate in jc1 and finish learning all the a level stuff at that point of time,btohqsg
and they have a year at least left to prepare for the gaokao,btohqsg
"Have you heard of the ""grey rock"" method? There's a theory that if you adopt the qualities of a stone  becoming impassive and bland  you will repel the argumentative  antagonistic people in your life who are itching for conflict.Here's how it works:https://cna.asia/4cnSxUb",btohqsg
Sec 4 in china is È´ò‰∏Äalrd,btohqsg
ip is more advanced than Sec school  iirc,btohqsg
I saw some RGS bio paper,btohqsg
I feel ip is much smoother in terms of the transition from secondary to JC,btohqsg
Sec 4 to J1 then is a big jump,btohqsg
Sec 5 to J1 is even bigger,btohqsg
Sec 5 iirc no pure sci right,btohqsg
My school quite a few people from Sec 5,btohqsg
Cuz for them sec 5 is already a big jump from sec 4,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what my friend told me ah,btohqsg
got like a lot of topics to learn+ revise old ones,btohqsg
Ohya ik someone who did this,btohqsg
if I were Sec 5 rn I would be prob going to RP/ITE üíÄ,btohqsg
My sis hear me thinking out loud for my,btohqsg
Then I'm like oh alpha sq or smth,btohqsg
O levels or a level vectors?,btohqsg
If want to go healthcare related courses + wanna to come back singapore  think twice about gg overseas,btohqsg
But other courses  if the overseas one is btr  then go for it!,btohqsg
This was me once during an exam  the examiner ask me shhh,btohqsg
A level vectors is like the one part of H2 math that i haven't touched since JC,btohqsg
there was a oil spill? damn,btohqsg
I was whispering stuff to myself so i dunno how would other candidates be able to hear,btohqsg
Yea and it is damn bad,btohqsg
yea i can see literally turned the coastal sands to black,btohqsg
I think i hv not touched everything except differentiation and algebraüíÄ,btohqsg
Not only that  it spread v wildly,btohqsg
The east coast plan finally came into fruition,btohqsg
yeah but considering my major  where vectors are literally everywhere  that type of vector geometry is still useless,btohqsg
For some reason i cant do math in silence,btohqsg
I need to talk to myself,btohqsg
I now know how it feels to be an American waking up to the smell of petroleum,btohqsg
It has been long since i touched math but i think sometimes reading out my working and ans to see if i made a careless mistake,btohqsg
So what x¬≤- ‚Öîx +5 smthing like that?,btohqsg
Sometimes i read out the qns to process,btohqsg
But luckily i got AA so there were only that many people in the rm,btohqsg
I did not get AA because of me talking to myself tho  it is sth else,btohqsg
Yay means u got the + sign on your cert too,btohqsg
The mark of a distinguished person,btohqsg
In pri sch  i had AA after one exam where i missed out a pg  then my dad requested for A3 paper  and a few times they accidentally also give me extra time,btohqsg
Yes which is practically useless nd waste of ink,btohqsg
Hey in their defence the certificate paper is print on is very soft and nice,btohqsg
Great for wiping ones ass with,btohqsg
My classmate used to have AA but he say will have the + sign so he not getting AA anymore,btohqsg
Unis won‚Äôt look at that right,btohqsg
No lah not just the environment,btohqsg
Isnt that also in O levels ?,btohqsg
It has not affected me in any way,btohqsg
Besides getting stigmatised by ur own peers,btohqsg
First few topics of h2 math alr taught in ip for alot of the ip jcs,btohqsg
Things is most of my exams I have a #+ notation,btohqsg
I only got AA fr end of sec 1,btohqsg
Graphing and Tranformation is applied in Trigo graphs (except use of GC),btohqsg
Apart from the parts that need a GCSome of the qns that dont need gc    i think a y4 can solve,btohqsg
Tbh it was a stupid decision to not apply for AA in uni,btohqsg
Ite does if I remember correctly,btohqsg
Just that we need to learn some algebra to find asymptotes,btohqsg
My dad be like ‚Äòwho ask u care about what others think  then never apply‚Äô,btohqsg
Wait i tot different institutions need to reapply?,btohqsg
Thing tho is Uni doesn't put,btohqsg
When i whine about not finishing the paper,btohqsg
Also all I did was submit my SEAB prior arrangements,btohqsg
I did not not apply because of the notation,btohqsg
Ur parents say what is like,btohqsg
It is because of it is highly stigmatised,btohqsg
I check my transcript don't have,btohqsg
Oh ya i did not declare itüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Bruh I always jealous of those who get AA,btohqsg
Ya i mean i did not apply is not because of the notation,btohqsg
It is because of the stigma,btohqsg
Everywhere is AC in my jc,btohqsg
Most of my friends dk one especially uni,btohqsg
Cuz the exam venues so many they cannot distinguish,btohqsg
It is because my course i see everyone in every exam,btohqsg
people who have AA probably rely on it heavily... i dont think thats something you should be very jealous of,btohqsg
Also cuz u don't get exams,btohqsg
Not like others who can choose their own stuff  and hence dunno most of their coursemate,btohqsg
it's not even like an advantage it's a genuine necessity,btohqsg
Everyone knows everyone in the course,btohqsg
Thanks for this coz most people thinks of it as an adv,btohqsg
But we just keep SEN needs an issue to avoid,btohqsg
My classmate who has ADHD said it has not benefited him in any way,btohqsg
Im prolly not finishing any papers w/o AA,btohqsg
You know u need like a documented reason rite?,btohqsg
My course doesn't rlly do exams,btohqsg
i wouldve failed psle without AA,btohqsg
So then again I haven't rlly seen a lot of advantage apparent from the occasional test and exam,btohqsg
Can i pose back a qns to uWhy would MOE readily give AA as an advantage?,btohqsg
Also how is aircon an advantage,btohqsg
And it's bold of em to assume that aircon is auto granted,btohqsg
Even in alevels got times I not granted aircon,btohqsg
My classmate openly said i can finish my econs paper because i get 30min extra,btohqsg
No some centres don't have aircon,btohqsg
TM has aircon in all exam rms  so it aint an adv,btohqsg
Newton Doesn't have aircon for example,btohqsg
And + i would rather not hv aircon,btohqsg
i had a friend that spend his AA time to doodle on the foolscap,btohqsg
Coz my hand freeze i cannot write,btohqsg
i would sit on my hand during papers to warm it up,btohqsg
U waste extra time off coz u dunno how to do the paperüíÄ,btohqsg
I always write until the last second,btohqsg
The please put your pens down,btohqsg
Sometimes i must admit is because i write 4 liner for a chem 1m qns,btohqsg
nah worse is write so much kenna carpal tunnel,btohqsg
Sometimes it's just me staring at the question thinking of how I structure it,btohqsg
Tbh i shld hv just asked for extra time in uni,btohqsg
Everytime i get v stressed when people start typing and i still hv 10 mcq,btohqsg
Yes i mean i would hv,btohqsg
Because logically speaking  AA = A(n) A(dvantage),btohqsg
In hindsight u could also applied mid sem or during your studies too,btohqsg
Just u didn't because of the perceived adversity,btohqsg
Which I mean I get. But still,btohqsg
But the stigma part of it kills me off,btohqsg
But now i feel i should not be disadvantaged because of what others think,btohqsg
And tbh i think i may hv done btr if i do my exams away fr others‚Ä¶at least i dun get stressed out by people who starts typing when i still hv 10 mcqs left,btohqsg
I know NUS has like an incomplete grade rite or like a special consideration grade?,btohqsg
Tbh i nearly not applied for it at As,btohqsg
NTU just says deal with it,btohqsg
Got into a debate w my parents before finally applying for it,btohqsg
But then again ok my dr did tell me most people dun apply for AA in uni / dunnid coz it is computerised exams,btohqsg
Either ways the separate room is just a conducive environment,btohqsg
It is v isolated but more conducive,btohqsg
U mean ur course dun hv exams?,btohqsg
Then what is ur AA for?,btohqsg
I hated AA sometimes especially for Poly and secondary school cuz our paper ended later but those idiots release come out talk like damn loud,btohqsg
Huh u staying for 1 week+,btohqsg
is usual for my fam lol,btohqsg
My AA rm is far fr the classrooms where others take their exams,btohqsg
from kl to penang not so far,btohqsg
No i mean if no exams  then AA for what?,btohqsg
Occasional tests and like 1 exam that over liao,btohqsg
Which is why AA ain't rlly impt for my course tbh,btohqsg
and the latest is the soviet union fr,btohqsg
U dox yourself also I mean it ain't your exact location,btohqsg
Been a long time since my clock synced to the ITE calendar,btohqsg
but my sis start next mon,btohqsg
Nice means u gonna intern soon rite if July..,btohqsg
i'll be in sch  no pay but got holiday,btohqsg
Waa that one damn shag üíÄ,btohqsg
Oh there are 2 types of internship depending on ur luck?,btohqsg
luck  is whether the company call u down for internship and whether u pass the interview,btohqsg
but got some company the look at grades,btohqsg
Ngl I feel the ones that look at grades are usually the government,btohqsg
They even want to see your PSLE ass well,btohqsg
and they are also the ones that take the longest in terms of application reviewing,btohqsg
Private usually they have their own unique assessment,btohqsg
they always ask for it bc that's like the standard application but whether the specific organisation looks at it is up to them,btohqsg
The line between government and private is kinda blur in SG,btohqsg
i think it somewhat depends on demand also,btohqsg
Like they vary a lot for private,btohqsg
we will never know companies process...just go in with an open mind,btohqsg
ITE intern matching kinda diff tho,btohqsg
Government they are usually standardized like what Si Yan says,btohqsg
It's more of a employer initiated process,btohqsg
But at the end of the day it really depends on the department,btohqsg
even their portal is shared among all government agencies,btohqsg
Then again the amt they pay is like 400-600,btohqsg
u mean employer finds u? not the other way?,btohqsg
If you are invited to the interview  it means you pass the screening of resume round,btohqsg
Then after that it is more of like behavioral assessment,btohqsg
Basically they submit the names into the system then it matches you if I remember correctly,btohqsg
I saw my friends intern matching and it was a wheel,btohqsg
my father told me that his old boss while choosing a employee would always look at their status of education. their thinking is knowing how rigourous or challenging it is to get a degree and would be thinking if said worker was to be put in something as challenging  would he/she be able to overcome this event.A degree gave confidence to the boss that is at least signifies that this person has accomplished it before  whether anot he is able to replicate that accomplishment is another thing. But in hindsight for someone that dont have a degree  the confidence is not even there to began with that he/she could overcome this event,btohqsg
Honestly speaking it depends on people to people,btohqsg
For those that want results spanning across different points of your life..its to gauge the cosistency of the person they are hiring,btohqsg
there are people who can talk well and smoke their way into a job but cannot work in the end,btohqsg
You submit it into the system,btohqsg
again it's just part of the standardised application but they usually won't care,btohqsg
I feel that the era now is they look at degree + intern/PT/project experience etc,btohqsg
I feel that one is legit not as important,btohqsg
you have to rmb as a boss...its either you hire a good employee that brings in more money for your company or hire a bad one that looses money for your company.,btohqsg
depends on the nature of the job,btohqsg
Leadership is usually more of a behavioral thing,btohqsg
Internship + FYP project relevance is more important tbh,btohqsg
And fresh grads won't usually be in the leadership roles,btohqsg
when applying for a*star stuff i got to final rounds of interview so that one only cared about undergrad level,btohqsg
I won't really trust fresh grads to lead a team though,btohqsg
if they cared about my a levels i'd have been out v fast lol,btohqsg
They mainly care about your penultimate qualifications,btohqsg
The rest actually is just good to know ig,btohqsg
i think uni automatically cancels out the past..but if u screw up uni highly unlikely they will look at A level and reconsider,btohqsg
once you're decently far into uni  anything before that doesn't matter,btohqsg
just like once you start having work experience  your degree matters less and less,btohqsg
But if you have two equally applicants who have meet the skillset round,btohqsg
jc/poly and sec sch can be lumped together tho for pre uni things,btohqsg
They will end up looking at who they can work well best,btohqsg
Personally you don't have to be too extraordinary in terms of skill sets,btohqsg
then the bosses will have to see..which varies from company to company  which person is better to fit into the company,btohqsg
hearing my mum interview someone...after the interview she is always v certain who is better,btohqsg
Like you can hit the skills and some employers believe that skill sets can be trained,btohqsg
Some people have the potential one and this type of thing need experience to see,btohqsg
There's always a preference one. I highly doubt it comes to a point whereby 2 candidates are the same,btohqsg
So people are also looking at that,btohqsg
Either one has more relevant internship with a specific company,btohqsg
this one depends...coz if employer believe the skill set can be trained  but someone hits it 100%  he / she will get the job,btohqsg
I had a nightmare a scholarship rejected me cause my ip4 was too shit,btohqsg
You confirm won't have two identical applicants,btohqsg
but honestly once you secured a degree in this day and age..most of your past results should not redefine your placement,btohqsg
What you usually have is two or more applicants who actually hit the requirements,btohqsg
identical twins: I beg to differ,btohqsg
Then out of like say the 5 people,btohqsg
i have dreams about my gpa every sem in uni lol,btohqsg
But ig y5 promos should override y4 promos,btohqsg
they say if theres a significant improvement from ip 4 to 5 then its also a plus,btohqsg
I had dreams whereby it fell so much I got kicked out unemployed,btohqsg
i dont think private companies will take the risk to train..then for the employee to leave for another company. This is more or so what govt companies have,btohqsg
At that stage  it usually boils down to potential  likeable etc,btohqsg
i had a dream my promos too bad and cannot take h3,btohqsg
i had a dream that i got no As and BBCB for my As,btohqsg
And then i broke down crying,btohqsg
the fact that i didn't dream about As shows how little i cared,btohqsg
Umm what I mean is not that the private companies training the guy,btohqsg
I don't have dreams about As,btohqsg
But more of like the idea that skills can be developed because you are exposed to it,btohqsg
No but the paper works well as pangsai zua,btohqsg
Like as a fresh grad  you confirm won't have the chance to deal with like production system,btohqsg
I dreamed that i was collecting a level results and he was there,btohqsg
Like you probably know what cloud is but then never actually really exposed to it,btohqsg
might as well use the blank paper,btohqsg
So these are probably one of the ways the company sort of is able to train you and hence you developed the skills,btohqsg
But ig if the person in my class who pon promos  promoted,btohqsg
if i could promote  anyone can,btohqsg
Because sometimes people lack that exposure,btohqsg
Y6 senior is the peak of zen,btohqsg
Are there people who y7 in ip,btohqsg
i didnt even know i did not collect my O lvl cert,btohqsg
Well...there are Y4 people in my jc....so...,btohqsg
until the sch called my mum few years ltr,btohqsg
Next year I will finally get my 90RP.But senior u stay so long the system now changed to 70RPAh shit.,btohqsg
Anyway does anyone study for gp,btohqsg
maybe after siyan's experience  now A level cert is like collect same day as result release,btohqsg
"the sentiment is alot of bosses feel like spending any amt of resource on any employee to help them advance their career is already very offputting.So usually the ""sort of is able"" generally always lies in the jobscope of things you have alr been scheduled to do as the employee under your role. Unless external factors  you will remain doing the same thing for quite a few years before you actually get introduced to new ideas and concepts",btohqsg
i study  but one day before As,btohqsg
"Me..... I had to study ""examples"" to use for my argumenrs",btohqsg
Its orange blue green yellow and then pain,btohqsg
Oh and also like the similar words things,btohqsg
i dun study coz i dunno how to study,btohqsg
i was just hoping for a C which i got,btohqsg
Like for paper 2 gp I always study all the synonyms and antonyms,btohqsg
wah damn should hv known u earlier so that i can learn how to study GP,btohqsg
But honestly speaking I this one is the boss mentality liao,btohqsg
Till this day I have no idea what a vocab or verb is,btohqsg
"Cus they always want ""in your own words"" kind of qns",btohqsg
It is a concept  thing or idea basically,btohqsg
coz i always end up cannot fit all points into the given word limit,btohqsg
"This is why the fresh grads now are trying to intern or at least work a yr or two at govt companies..gain skills and use the better ""work life balance"" to further their studies..then once they fill like they are confident enough then pivot to a startup or private companies",btohqsg
coz sometimes my word paraphrasing becomes more than 1 word,btohqsg
i mean summary isn't a one for one replacement,btohqsg
"But for me my teacher was like ""I want yall to create a notebook whereby yall compile all your synonyms  antonyms and words that you shld not use  etc etc""'",btohqsg
GP is just yapplogy as a subject,btohqsg
Like whenever wr come across a paper and need to do corrections,btohqsg
prob is generally most boss mentality is they will cut cost where possible..and if cost is spend on training employees...that they feel like is a short term benefit. they will cut it,btohqsg
Idk what I wrote for GP I just write what I felt like.,btohqsg
i only got better with language after i became an editor for some articles online,btohqsg
they forced me to be mentored in grammar and prose,btohqsg
my english is completely based on american rules now,btohqsg
at the end of the day  i did get what i hoped for,btohqsg
One of the days I am gonna write an email to my admin with justDear admin Help stars working not error,btohqsg
for most people they can identify what type of english you speak,btohqsg
"Anyways its very evident majority of companies with ""work/life balance"" are govt companies excluding those in defense.They are most likely always the company to always give their employees a chance of upskilling etc..they are the ones that dont mind if you jump ship  infact alot of the seniors that work 20-40 yrs  all look to those younger ones that decided to jump ship after working for 1-2 yrs at a govt corp or job with admiration",btohqsg
It guessed that I was black,btohqsg
Tho thought i was vietnamese as well,btohqsg
it guessed American for me then Sg which checks out,btohqsg
Ye bit of the hood in me as well üö¨,btohqsg
Btw curious  wat chair do u use,btohqsg
Oh Lord! Sowwy Sir didn't mean to intrude.,btohqsg
tbh ppl get damn surprised when I tell them English isn't my first language,btohqsg
But my chinese is üí© and they detected that,btohqsg
Cld ur ip address also change the result,btohqsg
Can the p5 do differentiation? Think not,btohqsg
the slide here looks so nice,btohqsg
not the arabic Portuguese and spanishüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Wait training to be a teacher?,btohqsg
Pisang Berangan is my go to,btohqsg
Either that or the Pisang Merah is actually pretty good,btohqsg
Herman Miller Aeron. it's really expensive but really good,btohqsg
i can justify it bc i spend like 12 hours at my desk per day,btohqsg
Ye i m tempted to get that usdd,btohqsg
Like i can find for 500 maybe 400,btohqsg
a used aeron is better than most new chairs,btohqsg
but pls go test it first,btohqsg
But my mom dont like used chair,btohqsg
make sure it can fit what you want,btohqsg
if you want legit good chairs it's usually herman miller or steelcase,btohqsg
I come and break your chair,btohqsg
I just sit down on your chair can liao,btohqsg
This actually took me 45 sec to read ngl,btohqsg
Idk looks like hieroglyphics to me,btohqsg
I stopped learning Chinese at P5,btohqsg
i don't rmb slides ever being used for me in pri sch,btohqsg
In a diff universe i can chinese,btohqsg
I only remember being whacked in the head by a file by a substitute teacher,btohqsg
i dropped to foundation in p5,btohqsg
Took 1 year for that process,btohqsg
I rmb my chinese cher in like p3 threw a marker at me for sleepingüíÄ,btohqsg
5-min only had to skip one of the passage,btohqsg
ik someone used models to present a physics lesson,btohqsg
"I vividly rmb one of my chinese cher say like ""you in p3 like lazy bug  this year like lion"" direct chinese translations",btohqsg
Was i arguing with the cher or smth?,btohqsg
this one is moe teaching scholarship ah,btohqsg
maybe shes saying u went from lazy to hardworking,btohqsg
She was scolding me for being lazy to rebelious i thinj,btohqsg
My class was the resignation class,btohqsg
How to say lazy bug in chinese again,btohqsg
We had 3 Chinese teachers all resigned after they met our class,btohqsg
2 like 1 week in ran out of the room crying,btohqsg
Idt ive ever seen a cher cry,btohqsg
I have seen like 10 cry,btohqsg
I provided the tissue for some of em,btohqsg
you were lucky i saw 4 teachers cry throughout pri/sec,btohqsg
Like cry so much until eyes red,btohqsg
Still pissed tho she used up my entire pack of tissue,btohqsg
if i rmb correctly  most of mine were cry+anger,btohqsg
oh damn what did y'all even do,btohqsg
any of yall saw the dc teachers cry b4,btohqsg
i too innocent  its always my classmates,btohqsg
u mean dun care or sth else,btohqsg
Had a substitute teacher come in try to be the tough one we had to leave the class early cuz half way one of my classmates threaten him with scissors,btohqsg
Like actually pointing it against his neck,btohqsg
the teachers from that group cry before? anybody saw any b4,btohqsg
I remember once I applied a government agency job and she says that her department is like very wlb,btohqsg
oh neh  2 of the dc teachers were my teachers in jc and they are strict  they fedup they shout  they dun cry,btohqsg
govt jobs for most part are wlb,btohqsg
Like it is suited if you want to retire there,btohqsg
Though it is part of the defense industry,btohqsg
Does this mean I getthe N word pass,btohqsg
cause alot of govt projects spanning years or even decades..and knowing how the people who start may not always end..they always have the wlb approach,btohqsg
Oh yeah our class like throwing stuff they throw a table into the teacher before,btohqsg
yea  one of my friend's friend from a few yrs ago said she intern pub for 1 yr...literally the majority of her time was going to the cafe to drink kopi,btohqsg
does anyone want my referral code,btohqsg
Got so bad they disbanded our class,btohqsg
i still remembered scene in pri 3...the teacher angry with this prefect and bang the table and took away his badge,btohqsg
P5 and P5 they split the entire class into 6 units,btohqsg
thats normal  out of the 4 teachers i saw cry  one was a dc teacher,btohqsg
i know people throw temper tantrums during primary school but your case is probably the worst,btohqsg
2 in pri  2 in sec. for dc teacher it was sec 2,btohqsg
or idk what r they even called for your class,btohqsg
Hey our class was calledinnovationfor a reason,btohqsg
cried infront of the whole class during a bag check with the other dc teachers standing by,btohqsg
innovate to make teachers leave when u dun want them,btohqsg
why is there a bag check,btohqsg
Is not even dun wan em,btohqsg
Either way I'm not really interested in the public sectors now so...,btohqsg
they got intel some of my classmates got illegal things in their bag,btohqsg
Legit half of em couldn't even speak in the class,btohqsg
not really disband the class but more of split the students into different classesi thought you meant the Innovation class got scrapped or something,btohqsg
It was so loud we drown out the noise of the cher,btohqsg
after the bag check  the dc teacher in charge  (not dc master) cried infront of the whole class and came out with some poetic statements,btohqsg
So it was just a incessant mishmash of noise drowned out and end up no lesson rlly occurs,btohqsg
"like one of those talks where the presumed idea was to ""Set the mind"" straight kind of talks",btohqsg
Like in front of the school cohort,btohqsg
wait there is this in primary school?,btohqsg
bruh they guess all wrong siala,btohqsg
Above P4 and with parents approval,btohqsg
speaking of which i know someone who got caught vaping but only 2w suspension,btohqsg
Back then vaping didn't rlly exist,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt piss off any teachers so I guess he‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
I assume is the thought process,btohqsg
I know of someone in uni who tried to sell vape,btohqsg
But tbh vaping that one quite minor,btohqsg
sometimes 'parents approval' is a for show on paper,btohqsg
Like everyday classmates wld mention ppl vaping but still no suspension lpl,btohqsg
If they caught every1 that vaped at least a whole class in my level is outüíÄ,btohqsg
u need to do sth stupid to be caught,btohqsg
like vaping in the toilet  vaping before sch etc,btohqsg
In Secondary got ppl piak piak also never got caught,btohqsg
The ones who do legit go out of their way,btohqsg
coz i think the fruity smell is quite obvios,btohqsg
"Our toilets always got ""air fresheners""",btohqsg
it's the very obvious fake or pungent smell like someone sprayed too much perfume or cologne,btohqsg
Had a few vapers say. After they do vape they tried smoking and the nicotine load was fucking non-existent,btohqsg
wasn't it said that vape has more chemicals ( i forgot if it's nicotine specifically or what ) inside them,btohqsg
that's why ppl who smoke say vape > cigarettes maybe,btohqsg
The main reason for the ban was cuz it was too varied or some shit but retarded la imo cuz by banning means u dun rlly regulate it,btohqsg
U cannot set limits on the nicotine load if u outright make it illegal,btohqsg
my sec sch class always had ‚Äúair freshener‚Äù during recess time,btohqsg
"i think in my school it was harder to find a place without the smell of ""air fresherners""",btohqsg
"I swear even that time i went into the teacher room to grab something i smell ""air fresheners"" üíÄ",btohqsg
I wish ITE toliets have that,btohqsg
But then again they would get vandalised immediately,btohqsg
The toliet in RP always have a fruity smell,btohqsg
i was about to suggest something but realized the boys' toilet might get destroyed seeing as there were fire breaking out a few times in ite east,btohqsg
if ite does implement air fresheners,btohqsg
Are the black shirts still as active in RP?,btohqsg
they only catch for gambling and vapes..everything else ignore alr,btohqsg
Yala so they still catch for the toliets,btohqsg
yea they still scout toilets and conduct pocket check,btohqsg
And the nice design fault of the side corner in all RP rooms,btohqsg
i dont think i will ever find the purpose of those benches at the end of the hallways,btohqsg
For a nice corner to make out with your strictly platonic friend..hypothetically,btohqsg
i dun understand people who bring vapes to school,btohqsg
they are like waiting for a ticket to caning / detention sort of thing,btohqsg
Usually u never bring it to school grounds,btohqsg
The smart ones keep it just outside,btohqsg
Not gonna elaborate more on that.,btohqsg
then how do people vape in the toilet,btohqsg
if they dun bring it to school grounds,btohqsg
it is still in my head,btohqsg
They bring it on campus. That's why I said the not smart ones do it in the toliet,btohqsg
cuz ur family always say this sort of things,btohqsg
speaking of which  i wun name schools  but JCs are less strict on vaping,btohqsg
just in case u think wild  it is not my sch,btohqsg
Then its tmjc before the merger,btohqsg
but not going to say anything further,btohqsg
