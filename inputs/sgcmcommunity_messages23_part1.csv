that's why i refer to purists or realists.   have you looked into who are the mclaren engine suppliers?,btohqsg
Bcos it was so long ago.Ppl like us were still young üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç,btohqsg
then lotus is never for purists. it formerly has toyota engine and now mercedes engine,btohqsg
Just because 500 units were sold? To put it into context  Bugatti only sold 450 veyrons as well and like Bugatti Toyota themselves said that they are not selling the car for profit  they developed the engine for F1 and endurance races but decided to build a road going car out of it and they did not attempt to take more orders for it than those they received before the launch itself. Similar to the carerra GT that was the result of an engine developed for F1 which couldn't be used there so used for LeMans and CGTs were made for the purpose of homologation,btohqsg
sigh. i dont know how to tell you. it has nothing with 500 or 1000 or whatever #. they built a car nobody bought.,btohqsg
What about the outgoing Aston Martin vantage V8? It uses the same powertrain as the AMG GT  still referred to as an Aston Martin,btohqsg
that in itself is a failure,btohqsg
Nobody bought? But all 500 were sold before the launch?,btohqsg
I am sure there would be many who would confirm with you that Lotus is a purist car in the erm.. purest sense. 100% driver focused.,btohqsg
if you argue this way then nothing failed! right? every model built by car makers made the cut,btohqsg
appreciate the car for what it is. it is still one of the best engines ever made.,btohqsg
aha  see you answered it. so it has nothing to do with what engine brand they choose to use. lotus is a car maker not engine maker . much like mclaren coach builder,btohqsg
only honda ferarri mercedes do everyting themselves,btohqsg
lotus is like mclaren. gets engines from ford renault honda however they want,btohqsg
therein my point. do you hear people say Mclaren is actually toyota?,btohqsg
go back to what you said sir,btohqsg
you said not for purists. but this has nothing to do with ourists or not purists.,btohqsg
With all due respect  I don't think you understand the difference between a rare enthusiast car and a regular Corolla if production numbers is all your measure of success is based on sir ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è failure is measured on many parameters!,btohqsg
so toyota can get engines from however they want too.,btohqsg
afterall toyota is not that great a sport car maker. they are mostly mass produced car maker,btohqsg
well  you can argue whatever way you want and you will still justify it.,btohqsg
if you built a car that people want to buy or you managed to sell to  then it is a success.,btohqsg
no matter how great the engineering is you wanted to skew that wayu,btohqsg
And Lexus didn't do that by selling all 500 units they planned to make?,btohqsg
so if almost everyone says it is a flop  it is a flop,btohqsg
why do you think so many say it is a flop?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  nice to meet you üëã,btohqsg
anyway  if you think otherwise  you are entitled to your views/,btohqsg
https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a34773460/lexus-lfa-technical-deep-dive-video/oh oh.. here is another website saying something else,btohqsg
why is everyone saying it is such a great and legendary?,btohqsg
Sadly people look at it with different eyes as compared to how they look at a Veyron which sold lower units  took around the same time to develop  had the company is loss as the money made was far less than the r&d costs and the production run was also around a decade long just like the LFA,btohqsg
point is just appreciate it for what it is. we are not experts here and no one is making statements about fails or otherwise.  Different perspectives help to open up our minds.,btohqsg
I guess badge respect is something that one can never get rid of ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
They're doing really well with the Yaris in the rally stages as well!,btohqsg
this has been a glaringly neglected space in their portfolio!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm looking forward to the 2023 Corolla GR,btohqsg
The Toyota and Corolla names just shows their confidence! üëçüèº,btohqsg
F1 MonacoRedbull no.1 no.3Honda Engine üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyway the best thing about the LFA is done by Yamaha not Toyota even,btohqsg
The best thing about the Supra is done by BMW üòè,btohqsg
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hotcars.com/lexus-lfa-facts/amp/Some other parts of the LFA that people overlook at times!,btohqsg
Yamaha only came in with the exhaust tune sound leh‚Ä¶ and well if a car is such a technical marvel  and technically it is superior to many cars out there‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I'm not saying the other features not good what,btohqsg
Just the most surprising thing on that car  and the one thing that makes it one of the best in the world,btohqsg
That NA V10 is just‚Ä¶ amazing.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/RJJ2Rf92kGsDrift King is impressive by the GR Yaris. He did a Gutter TurnüòÖüëç,btohqsg
sir... its not meant to be emotive. The V8 is tuned to be smooth and relaxing for a beautiful sunset cruise with the top down. For some angry grunty V8 from lexus  please go search up the RCF. Its like saying u want a rolls royce ghost V12 to scream like a murcielago.,btohqsg
"initially  i had the same sentiments as you why dont just put a VR38 into the supra since its tuneable etc.. But when you think of it  the B58 and 2JZ share many similarities. Both Turbo Inline 6 while VR38 is a V6. B58 is equally tuneable to VR38 and 2JZ so in some way the heritage is still ""preserved"". The VR38 is also from Nissan and Nissan supplying them an engine makes 0 sense.Hence  B58 from BMW is probably the best engine to be fitted in the MK5 Supra",btohqsg
LFA is completely a flop when you think of it as a production car. When you think of it as a car to elevate the Lexus brand  it work wonders. Lexus didnt create the LFA to sell thousands of units. When i ask you about lexus  do you think of the woman that told you the IS250 is much better than her A4 or the legendary screaming V10 LFA?,btohqsg
to a certain extent you are right  but there are very much different ways to look at it. This will be a circular arguement because we all have different definition of successful hence to each their own!,btohqsg
