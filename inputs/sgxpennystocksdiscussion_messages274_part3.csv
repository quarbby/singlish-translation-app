Bookmark this page where you can do a search of the company to find out the announcement — halt  unhalt  why etc :https://www.sgx.com/securities/company-announcements?pagesize=100Otherwise  go download the SGX app where you can set notification for such announcements too.,btohqsg

use common sense when asking la,btohqsg
hope it wont affect avarga    got power plant operation,btohqsg
junta cant operate themselves. they grab land easier,btohqsg
Won't affect as this is a neccessity. But commercialisation may take a backseat.,btohqsg
Anyway  this is the smallest sector for avarga,btohqsg

So Low already still they throw. 3 million shares bought up at 27 🙏🙏,btohqsg
I guess they want out totally . No more emotional attachment,btohqsg
Top glove (mother stock) Seems like the retailer able to hold the price. 😂,btohqsg
"seems like able to ""hold"" but unable to ""pump up"" further anymore.",btohqsg
But also hard to say lar  haha,btohqsg
another thing to note is that many retail investors who bought at Top Glove penthouse will be reluctant to sell. In fact  many retail investors become shareHOLDERS if the share price stays below their entry price. They will keep HOLDing one,btohqsg
I read somewhere that unless lender requested jpm to return the script. Then jpm got to buy back to return.,btohqsg
