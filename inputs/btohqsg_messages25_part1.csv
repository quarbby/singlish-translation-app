Exactly. So like I mentioned above  all first timer in this project high chance will have a Q number  itâ€™s only whether within supply or not.  Even out of supply but within the 300% also will get a Q number.Cos if u do the math there. First timer only is 2.1 for 4 room. The rest are all second timer which makes up the biggest number of applicants in the 4 and 5 room.So 2.1 it means around average 2 couples fighting to one unit. Thatâ€™s why I say itâ€™s 50/50 chance in getting a Q within supply,btohqsg
Actually the last sbf (Rivervale) . There are ppl whos profile missing but still got Q number.I was at that group that time.,btohqsg
Thanks! Do you remember if the Q numbers they got were within supply?,btohqsg
Not sure about that. It depends on individual luck too,btohqsg
Actually now I think I understand what is queue number within supply n queue number outside supply.Example  if there are 300 units  hdb will definitely issue  more than 300 queue numbers  say total 500 queue numbers are issued.So among 500 queue numbers  300 are within supply and 200 are outside supply. So these 200 are actually holding queue number but may not get a unit if the queue number is far behind and also assuming all queue no.1-300 did select the unit.In this example  Hdb cannot just issue 300 numbers  if so  all these 300 applicants will definitely 100% get the unit.,btohqsg
Yes. HDB issues queue number for 3x the number of available flats,btohqsg
So 100 units = 300 queue numbers,btohqsg
Ah I see. So always 3x?,btohqsg
If 300 unit x 3 = 900 que number issue.,btohqsg
The tips is to ballot for a project that has an application rate of 1 and below. You will definitely receive a que number within supply ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
"""No la  it's really subjective. HDB doesnâ€™t just issue 300 queue numbers for 300 units. They definitely buffer to account for those who might not select a unit. So even if you're outside the initial queue number  you still have a chance  especially if you're okay with choosing a lower floor or one of the less popular units.",btohqsg
Ya lor  this is why I said hdb cannot issue queue numbers based on exact number of units of the flat type.  Understand queue nimbers are issued 3x of the units of  the flat type.,btohqsg
So i guess  actually when you receive your queue number you will know whether your number is within the supply or outside the flat type supply.If there are 300 units of the flat type n your queue number is 310  then I believe it is known outside the supply so in this case you will have to hope that those queue number from 1-300 some dropped out or withdraw  in order to push your number into the selection chance. This is what I thought.Not sure it is correct & logical?,btohqsg
this is based on the assumption that ethnic quota has been accounted for. there were instances where applicants within the supply were unable to select due to insufficient ethnic quota,btohqsg
Thanks for reminding of the ethic quota.,btohqsg
Hi  any specific telegram group for the feb bto @ woodlands edge?,btohqsg

How to go for bayshore or other project if can't get HV? Need to submit again or actually given a chance by hdb for you to choose from another project if your turn to select unit at HV but HV run out of ethnic?,btohqsg
E.gJune ur bto no. out of supply say 300/100 unitsthen Apply for Oct  ur queue no. say 50/100 within supply and decent numberbut if HDB ask u to go June selection  u have to select,btohqsg
Else june and oct both queue no. cancelled,btohqsg
Can I have group for perc clover,btohqsg
Oh so even given queue number but out if supply and haven't call for selection  I still can submit for Oct bto. Is that what you mean?  But after my submission then hdb call me for Jun selection  I MUST select otherwise both my jun & Oct submission will be canceled? Worst is that  I might became 2nd timer  is my understabding correct?,btohqsg
and yes as long out of supply can apply next launch,btohqsg

Hi i have a selection appt w HDB this 19th but not able to make it. Does anyone of u able to change ur appt to different date?,btohqsg
Did you apply as single or with a partner/family member?,btohqsg
With my child. 2 of us,btohqsg
Can someone else help you to select? You can complete this authorisation form for someone to help you select on your behalfRecommend this over giving up your appointment  as there's no way to reschedule  I think you have to walk in after a certain time and you will lose your original queue positionhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/EAPG-CSC/Authorisation-To-Select-a-Flat.ashx,btohqsg
Oh hmmm you can authorise someone to select on your behalf  that would be better than selecting at a later date as people behind your queue will go first and select,btohqsg
Hi  I'm asking for someone I know. Her bto is projected to be up in 2026 but unfortunately she is currently going through divorce. Is there anyway she can still get the house or she will have to give up the house and pay penalty? She has a kid.,btohqsg
If im not wrong  she can change the flat name to be under her and her kid,btohqsg
Still can get w her kids if both is Singaporean. But she alone must also can afford the loan,btohqsg
I heard its not advisable to put kids name for the flat right?,btohqsg
Is there any documents to submit/ any declaration to be made before receiving the keys?,btohqsg
Would you rather a roof over head or no roof over head for both you and child? If itâ€™s a single parent (widowed/divorced)  youâ€™d see they have only one choice,btohqsg
This was the best answer i found online for ur question..last time i was also curious about it,btohqsg
But i strongly recommend u to confirm with hdb or a lawyer first beforehand,btohqsg
If the kids is small can la. After MOP he is free already,btohqsg
When i get my BTO  my wife is long term pass and my son Singaporean  so im the only owner  my son and wife is essential Occupier,btohqsg
If the child is under your share and control  u can but case by case. Just get a lawyer to draft and appeal  best is you check with the lawyer during a consult what are the chances. They would know best,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need lawyer to draft laâ€¦ so chor siaâ€¦ Just write into HDB should suffice. Not their first time encountering such situations,btohqsg
Ya lor. Additionally lawyer = $$$$ ðŸ«¢,btohqsg
I think what he meant was if u going thru divorce surely u would have to use a divorce lawyer. So just ask the divorce lawyer to help draft,btohqsg
