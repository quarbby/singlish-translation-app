Acrometa notice of record date for its 1-1 rights ($0.020) will be 27th Dec 2022.Some Background:1) Acrometa‚Äôs Price was hovering mainly approx $0.066 to $0.073 in the period leading up to this rights issue announcement on the 28th Nov 2022.2) Acrometa recent FY showed profit turnaround with top line and bottom line growth3) This rights issue was priced very low at $0.020 and hence IMO meant to- not dilute existing shareholders- give existing shareholders chance to participate4) IMO they are raising funds and position themselves better to undertake their projects with sufficient cash flow due to their growing order book.5) Acrometa IPO was $0.220 in April 2016 and in their all time high in 2016 was $0.885.6) NAV : $0.0531. Market cap approx $6m. Based on recent EPS of $0.0115 per share in FY21   the PE is only about 4x. Current market float is only about 138.5 mil shares.7)Their business are clean room infrastructure solutions   waste to energy  co working labs  facility management,btohqsg
Economists place 70% chance for US recession in 2023December 20  2022 8:15 PMWASHINGTON ‚Äì Economists say there is a 7-in-10 likelihood that the US economy will sink into a recession next year  slashing demand forecasts and trimming inflation projections in the wake of massive interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Read more:https://bit.ly/3G7BtV2,btohqsg
Then u finally see things become cheaperüòÇüòÜ,btohqsg
Acrometa monthly chart view shows an initial interests in first 5 months in 2016  going all the way to $0.885 and now trading at $0.046 with rights issue at $0.020.Judging from the small float of 138.5 mil shares  there would not be much sellers at current price range.In fact  this rights issues IMO is good for existing Shareholders to subscribe and we would likely see some buy ups as we head closer to 27th Dec 22 Cum Rights record date.IMO  I believe that we might see a pump soon  similar to that of Biolidics play on their rights.Reason being  there will not be much sellers for the mother shares at current price range as the cost price of most shareholders would be $0.07 and above and most retailer stuckists would actually be in the $0.35 and above based on 2016 big pump which would have trapped many.Therefore  this rights issue is good for earlier stuckists as to average in their position. We would expect this rights to be very well taken by most with many going for excess application.,btohqsg
Acrometa market depth for reference. Due to the small float and how illiquid they are at current price  we believe that BBs will jump into this one because of how easy they could be pumped.Let‚Äôs compare this to a recent rights pump etc . In Biolidics where they have been bleeding money and yet still they were pumped big during the period leading to the rights.Acrometa on the other hand has just turned around their business and have big order book to fulfil  which makes this a safer and easy play for any MMs as there will not be much sellers at current price because very few will see any incentive to sell at this price rangeTherefore  watch closely as I believe a pump could be near since cum rights is 27th Dec 22(Which means anyone still holding these shares will be given the rights to buy the shares at $0.020)Should get interesting soon. Hope we are right but DYODD too.,btohqsg
Based on the recent FY21  Acrometa still have $6 025 000 cash and bank balances. Hence  this proposed rights issue exercise which could potentially raise $2.73 mil which will further strengthen their balance sheet and working capital for their order book.Extract from earlier announcement üì£‚ÄòThe Board had considered alternative means of fundraising  including but not limited to raising capital through third-party placements to meet the Group‚Äôs working capital needs but decided against doing so as such placement would represent a significant dilution to existing Shareholders. Instead  the Board believes that undertaking the Rights Issue would strengthen the financial position and capital base of the Group and also reward Shareholders who have supported the Group over the COVID-19 pandemic period  providing existing Shareholders who are confident in the future prospects of the Company with an opportunity to maintain their equity participation in the Group and participate in the future growth of the Group.‚Äô,btohqsg
Recap on the earlier post shows Acrometa actually FA wise  doing pretty good but and this rights issue merely a pro active effort by management to improve their working capital to position themselves better for the growth they are expecting and the projects they have to fund etc.Hence  do keep this one close in view as current price is cheap and high chance we should see a rights pump play happen üôèüèªhttps://t.me/sgxpennystockstradingplan/3872,btohqsg
Acrometa daily chart.- big gap down right after proposed rights issue announcement üì£- MaCD turned up.- cum rights date 27/12/22 (if you have the mother shares after this date  you will have the rights to get the chance to buy acrometa at $0.020)This should be an easy pump and I believe BBs will be interested.The projection is a possibility due to- buying Frenzy to try get rights to buy acrometa at a durian price of 0.020- possible pump up to entice most to convert the rights to raise the funds required- light counter and not much sellers will be found at this gap down level IMOFingers crossed ü§ûüèΩDYODD. Keep in view,btohqsg

Yup you are right  we can never trust too easily . But for me this is a very good money making opportunity due to the risk reward here actually. RRR is good at their current prices considering almost no strong sellers at this price as no one see incentive to sell.Would some one who is stucked $0.35 above or $0.22 (IPO price) sell at $0.045? Or those who got mainly before rights issue announce ($0.069 to $0.072) if holding sell now if already bought up shares? Highly likely no  therefore I believe game on for this counter,btohqsg
Acrometa with this low price rights at never ever been here price region  makes this one a strong candidate for any pump games . I believe BBs would think the same,btohqsg
acrometa wait till XR only buy. current price too high. close to right price i will enter,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok. Dax and I think it‚Äôs cheap to collect,btohqsg
This was Biolidics rights play pre-rights and during rights from my re-collection . (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)Do note Biolidics even had Clearbridge dumping open market and were bleeding money. (Otherwise  I believe they would have ran much further on this rights play)Acrometa on the other hand  balance sheet decent with $6mil cash on hand  recent showed turnaround profit with higher top line and at current price the market cap is just over $6 mil . Their recent EPS in FY statement is $0.0115 too.Order book growing with investment in waste to energy  co-working labs business is good potential theme plays too.DYODD as I am giving my opinion and now price wise I see value as I do not like to chase.For me i believe if have some holding power  can take some and try to get rights too as I believe it will be played  whether now or future.,btohqsg
