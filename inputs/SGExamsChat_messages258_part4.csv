during my FYP we followed this SCRUM methodology that our school taught us,btohqsg
"but the most important part were the daily ""SCRUM Meetings""",btohqsg
where we would simplify to writing on our tele group1. What I completed yesterday2. What I intend to do today3. What difficulties I'm facing and who can help me,btohqsg
cus no one wants to look bad being the only slacker on the team,btohqsg
It sounds like a rly good plan.,btohqsg
it takes only a few minutes  but it's daily,btohqsg
so no going MIA unless u inform everyone first,btohqsg
Yeah  during practical experiment and during lessonsBut then I'm not sure why they did not reply any single message to usMy team leader and I kept asking them something in Telegram group  they didn't reply back anythingðŸ˜’,btohqsg
if you know for sure they're slacking  then start sounding pagro,btohqsg
"""[name] can you reply? Do we need to ask our supervisor to help u reply?""",btohqsg
but the other case might be that they have a geniune issue that they're not too comfortable with sharing publicly atm,btohqsg
Typical grp work be like that,btohqsg
in that case  try pmming them to check if everything is fine and if there's anything u can help with,btohqsg
Do you mean like private message? I had tried sending messages to them privately  but they did not reply back tooðŸ˜­,btohqsg
you might wanna discuss this issue with ur supervisor then,btohqsg
Haizz okayI hope they actually do something ahIf they really don't do anything  we will never get the information that we need,btohqsg
prior to going MIA  what were they like?,btohqsg
were they participating in group discussions?,btohqsg
Our practical experiments were on every WednesdayOne of them was not able to come on some of Wednesdays because he's retaking a module  which also clashed on WednesdayBut when he was able to attend the meeting for the practical experiments  he was helping us a lot  which same goes to my another teammateI had reminded both of them to actively see my team leader's and my messages in Telegram group as we would be sharing a lot of important information for us to write on our logbook and reportThey at first participated in Telegram group. However  they gradually went MIA  especially after the government announced that gathering had to be reduced to 2 people.,btohqsg
Then no more participated in group discussions,btohqsg
