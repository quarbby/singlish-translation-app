Gen x is 15 yrs (1965-1980)Gen y is 15 yrs (1981-1996)Gen z is 15 yrs  (1997-2012)I thought,btohqsg
Lmao what happen to 4 yrs of gen alphaüíÄ,btohqsg
Anyways all I know is alpha has a term called Glass generation,btohqsg
Because they grew up with digital devices since they were born,btohqsg
Some experts suggest that due to recent rapid changes in how children are raised  develop  and grow up  the time spans used to define recent generations such as Gen Alpha and later  should be shortened. They believe that  as a result of rapid technological development and its quick integration into modern society such as social media (being present for the entire lives of Gen Alpha members unlike the majority of Gen Z) as well as AI ¬†psychological development of these generation(s) is vastly different from any previous generation and would benefit from the definition of new generations (or re-definition of Gen Alpha) into shorter  more specific chunks.,btohqsg
what is the difference between Gen Z and Gen Alpha?,btohqsg
gen z kids do not have the liberty of touching a smart screen device the moment they could walk is the reasoning online,btohqsg

Bro gonna pay extra for roller coasters,btohqsg
when i book seats on the airplane i get the whole aisle for free,btohqsg
"Imagine if roller coasters impose a ""The more you weigh  the more expensive you pay""Reason: heavier weight causes more wear and tear on the roller coaster",btohqsg
When I book seats the pilot has to recalculate the center of gravity to offset the seat(s) i am in,btohqsg
Or even more closer to home  buses and trains impose the same system,btohqsg
If you weight more  you pay more,btohqsg
Because it cause more wear and tear on the modes of transport you are taking,btohqsg
sounds like a plan  we gotta save the environment right,btohqsg
let them fat people take private transport and cause more gas emission,btohqsg

I have a 6.0/5.0 in my PhD in Yappology from National Unversity of Sexual harassment,btohqsg

It's more on a social life level. Studying ACCA feels way too isolating at times,btohqsg
Also once u go out u learn that u are alone at the end of the day.,btohqsg
Only you are the best advocate for yourself :D,btohqsg

Shared by a follower :On July 4th at around 8:40 AM  I was on bus 161 and noticed a man filming me for a full minute straight. I managed to confront him and recorded our interaction (just me  forcing him to delete the video. PS I was scared (literal shaking) & tried to remain calm). I‚Äôve already reported this to the police  though I‚Äôm not sure if they can do anything. I just want to raise awareness and caution others about him who are taking bus161.Imagine how many girls he might have recorded  who didn‚Äôt dare/notice to confront him.

As a girl myself  i hated this type of ‚ÄúËá™ÊÅãÁãÇ‚Äù,btohqsg
"another of ""Âº†Ëñá""case happened in singapore",btohqsg
there's a girl who self-righteously claimed that a guy filmed her for 1 minute straight on bus 161 and posted a warning message online to warn other people ( mainly girls ) about him but we are thinking that she's too extreme in her behaviour because she's the one that ended up posting a clip of him while attacking him verbally as he used his phone,btohqsg
same as the Âº†Ëñácase in China,btohqsg
explains a lot  thought the guy was taking upskirt video of her,btohqsg
Next time I aim to take a photo of anything and a girl is infront of the frame  I must say excuse me,btohqsg

Wah idw do aptitude test anymore ngl,btohqsg
They gave me some stupid ass questions,btohqsg

And they never give speed of the water or wind speed,btohqsg
idk how to explain but its not meant to be seen as hard or easy,btohqsg
wait i think they did for water and wind,btohqsg
but like holy shit i wanted to kms,btohqsg
"I was like ""wait i didn't learn this shit""",btohqsg
ryan u can do that question?,btohqsg
these kind of qns there is no one answer,btohqsg
usually its a range of accepted answers,btohqsg
so they want you to get the closest ans you think is possible,btohqsg
I mean that's one question only,btohqsg
mcq  so what are the options,btohqsg
calculate distance of the boat moved if the water speed is insert (random number) and the wind resistance is (insert random number) in 10 sevonds,btohqsg
They didn't used like speed or anything,btohqsg
they said if wind speed is 1 or 3 then resistance is 2 and the boat SA,btohqsg
If u get a similar question do u think u can solve,btohqsg
no kidding i would take the bigger- the smaller number,btohqsg
and give that as the speed,btohqsg
Cross out the MCQ and write out the steps,btohqsg
who likes japan ah  is it musician?,btohqsg
I passed he aplitude test anyways,btohqsg
btw what course do u think i was applying for based on that question,btohqsg

idk why i use both interchangeably lol,btohqsg
Iq test no need stress one,btohqsg
its either u dumb or u dumb,btohqsg
aptitude test just need know the basics,btohqsg
#stpotd: 16 species of insects have been approved for consumption in Singapore. Here are some bugs which could appear on restaurant menus:https://str.sg/j6oVWould you want to try these?,btohqsg
Meal worm and cricket is yes from me,btohqsg
How tf u eat honey bees,btohqsg
i want to see someone eat locust cause they are hig af,btohqsg
even i wont eat crickets if they are adults,btohqsg
How does someone eat that please...,btohqsg
its not good if it is an replacement for chicken  pork and beef,btohqsg
to add on to nutritional value of foods,btohqsg
like u wont be able to tell diff one,btohqsg
btw have they mentioned how they will be sold?,btohqsg
can you imagine going to a pasar malam,btohqsg
its high in all essential minerals and vitamins,btohqsg
i cant imagine going to a mall and have to walk pass displays of dead insects,btohqsg
if they sold it this way  confirm backlash,btohqsg
and Politicians and Bill Gates will still be taking meat,btohqsg
Crickets quite literally have a higher nutritional value compared to beef and chicken,btohqsg
later it may be replacing meat entirely,btohqsg
Wont ah if ppl want meat there will still be meat,btohqsg
Lab grown is a thing now,btohqsg
u cant rlly argue that once we past that pt,btohqsg
Here are the 16 species of insects approved as food in Singapore. Would you try them?https://cna.asia/3zAJilq,btohqsg
crickets arent that bad if u reduce to powder,btohqsg
but they say meat causes climate change,btohqsg
they make for very good addition to flour for baked goods,btohqsg
They will only remove farming if right the labs are able to keep up with human consumption of meat,btohqsg
Those fuckers are the minority so,btohqsg
they are not pushing not stopping to eat meat,btohqsg
if they push for eating insects,btohqsg
it cld only mean one thing right,btohqsg
they find it to be a untapped market with a lot of money to make,btohqsg
Prime example being ppl like me that will spend money on it if its available LOL,btohqsg
Hey guys for those who went for NP IT EAE aptitude test can you guys tell me some of the questions they asked you lol,btohqsg
Applied to and interviewed for a job at Hands on Film. I kinda hope I get it,btohqsg
guys in jc can you just pon cca all the the way,btohqsg
will your cca call your parents or will anything bad happen if you pon,btohqsg
might as well not join if youre gonna pon all the way ?,btohqsg
but eh if your jc has compulsory cca then :(,btohqsg
Probably not but you need to give mcs ig,btohqsg
i would not join cca if it was optional fam,btohqsg
Don't you just not attend and they will eventually kick you out,btohqsg
2. Ask teacher whether can dont join a cca cus results is shit,btohqsg
3. Take MC every week (Least effective cus waste money plus very obvious and affect portfolio),btohqsg
But why do you not wanna join cca?,btohqsg
I think those are quite slacker in sec school  idk about jc,btohqsg
No offense but for my jc have  we have interact club and library club,btohqsg
Ok library club now got do more stuff,btohqsg
But i guess it depends the type of slack you want the slack to be,btohqsg
jc got those cca which appears barely any activity or people inside but it's still considered active?ik poly and ite have those kind but jc culture? im not too familiar,btohqsg
I mean for my jc  interact club was the only slack cca. The rest had some form of activity. Though tbh some people view strategy club slack while others view strategy club as intellectually strenuous.,btohqsg
my cca is own time own target,btohqsg
basically you write/design an article of your choice,btohqsg
Wyatt let's open a CCA to just slack,btohqsg
then us excos compile into a magazine,btohqsg
if you're not exco it's as slack as can get alr,btohqsg
Nah  I alr have a non slack cca üòÇ,btohqsg
That sounds like the shit I did in eng class  told me to cut out a news article then write a whole reflection on it,btohqsg
Why would u subject yourself to that?,btohqsg
except for handover and like orientation parties,btohqsg
I see it as a hobby....,btohqsg
always wanted to join since jh but jh didn't have that cca,btohqsg
but tbh i really love my jh cca too,btohqsg
But yea if you go ask arnd right  confirm there is a cca that is the most slack,btohqsg
my cca still need to put in a bit of work,btohqsg
but then alot of ppl have it as a second cca along another cca w more commitment,btohqsg
i skipped all my cca in jc,btohqsg
Oh chey the most slack is probably those clubs,btohqsg
i had 2 cca in jh and nah im not doing that again in sh,btohqsg
I joined 2 ccas...drama and student council,btohqsg
Isn't that mutually exclusive in Student Council?,btohqsg
And... they nvr even ask me to come back to my jc lol,btohqsg
No no this drama and sc drama is different,btohqsg
i thought you were in choir,btohqsg
For drama club  you have a choice to be IN the drama,btohqsg
only singing i do is breaking people‚Äôs eardrums,btohqsg
One is applied drama the other is theoretical,btohqsg
For sc  you have no choice,btohqsg

Let's hope the undergrads actually come for tutorials,btohqsg
U are already doing so. With stellar performance I might add.,btohqsg
at most i give you a one on one session,btohqsg
If consult can u treat kopi?,btohqsg
Yayyy lemme go search up his schedule on STARs,btohqsg

Ya but holy shit I swear the breaks in btw are horrendous,btohqsg
The holes bigger than my - nvm,btohqsg
You wanna see a more disgusting one,btohqsg

why would you do that to yourself,btohqsg
That was the only slot for condensed matterrrr,btohqsg

And then the ph2104 one is legit he ownself put in the morning,btohqsg

Does anyone have a 2024 eae list?,btohqsg
"The ""work"" is the teacher working hrs I'm guessing",btohqsg
cuz i didnt get external company,btohqsg
Ye then basically teacher telling you that although MC's are not going to affect your internship results/outcome  you still have to send to them and your work supervisor,btohqsg
Rn u are basically an intern of ITE entitled and governed fully by the employment act  follow MOM law in regards to MCs and Vaild Absences.,btohqsg
MOM doesn't specify exactly leave entitlement for interns but in this case this would be granting based on compassionate reasons at the employers discretion which is ITE. That's why your CA say like that,btohqsg
is the tele chill corner in any relation to chill corner on discord,btohqsg
