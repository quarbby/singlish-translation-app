any honda civic (2016+) owner here,btohqsg
me total noob first time driving civic today. when I want to reverse into carpark lot  the car only let me reverse for abit only because fully stopping.  if want to reverse must use accelator but this one not my car so I scared later hit the back,btohqsg
"Most rear kerbs are under the rear bumper height so if your sides are clear  u can just slowly reverse till it ""locks""",btohqsg
not sure leh  is there a button to release?,btohqsg
If there are people in the rear then have to be a bit more cautious. I cringe every time I drive off w rear passengers and the underside scrapes,btohqsg
Does it engage normally? When you're driving?,btohqsg
err i not really sure because I came from vios,btohqsg
and I never drive honda cars before,btohqsg
Most ICE cars will creep when not stepping on brakes  while in gear,btohqsg
does the auto brake turn on whenever engine start,btohqsg
Depends on model and make  and can even be aftermarket flashed.If you brake to a stop like a traffic light  does the civic hold thebrake? Do you need to tap the accelerator to move off?,btohqsg
oh actually yeah I reversed until it lock. (if by locking you mean like releasing the brake and the car isnt moving)but then the car is still abit infront of the lot,btohqsg
that one I don't really notice because I always put my leg on the brake pedal,btohqsg
Carpark lots are like that. No real rule to how long it must be. A vios will usually fit with space  but a civic slightly longer. If u notice mb s class or higher end cars etc will usually not fit fully. Just take a look next time you are in a carpark  most cars are not fully inside the lot. In fact most drivers will back up all the way to the rear kerb  then go in neutral/drive to move forward a bit  1 of 2 cm  so the rear tyres aren't pressed up to relieve the pressure.,btohqsg
ohhh I see   because the car is the only one sticking out and this isn't my car so I don't want anything to happen 😂,btohqsg
Look at the Mazda 6 vs jazz length for example. Np.,btohqsg
actually isit possible for companies to modify the reverse safety collision system? because the car has a body kit so is that a plausible reason why my car didn't went all the way in to damage the bumper?,btohqsg
That why stock is best haha,btohqsg
every time when u are changing new car  you will apperciate how much money you had save  if the car is stock hehe,btohqsg
Stock and also cheaper than other similar range LOL,btohqsg
sometime the more u mod  the slower then car get hehe,btohqsg
Depends what u mod? If u keep on putting weight LOL then yeah lo,btohqsg

Forget liao 3 month ago wife go get   but is only name driver   so valet also can’t,btohqsg
good reminder to always check the insurance policy wording,btohqsg
Sob the road tax is xiong,btohqsg
anyway for insurance  many factors will influence the premium. driver stats aside  power output aside  i think the biggest one is the actual market value of the car  which of course depreciates over time. so you could get a relatively 'high risk' car having decent premiums if its aged a bit  since it will have a lower market value as an insurance payout,btohqsg
If owner can afford the car  🙃,btohqsg
I go back to Tamiya or Tomica ><,btohqsg
best  not affected by fuel prices 🤣,btohqsg
Young and experience is the top factor..,btohqsg
