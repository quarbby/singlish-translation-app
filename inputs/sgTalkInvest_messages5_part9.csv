Hello  anyone knows if we can take loan in Singapore to purchase property overseas eg. South Korea? And what the rates are like?,btohqsg
I am exploring to upgrade from Hdb to condo  any one can advise the pros and cons? Or should I keep Hdb and buy new condo?  Open for discussion,btohqsg
how much spare cash you got to downpay?,btohqsg
If you keep your first property  2nd property is got TDSR   and LTV loan to valuethe amount of bank LTV for 2nd property is only 50%Means a $1m property u can only borrow $500k,btohqsg
Plus U need to fork out 12% ABSD for 2nd property$50k is not enough to even pay for the taxes.,btohqsg
OK   then should I sell off my Hdb and upgrade to condo?,btohqsg
ltv is still 75% if hdb has no more loans. absd still apply at 12%,btohqsg
50k spare cash not sufficient  probably have to sell your hdb first and upgrade after,btohqsg
its up to u i guess?but u are not increasing your income or wealthbut u are increasing the quality of life i guess?,btohqsg
personally your first property can't build wealth for u. coz even if ur first property appreciate  u also cannot take money out without buying a new property to live inonly 2nd property make money.but ABSD means toughmy suggestion is REITS though. but u need to read up more on REITs and google a lot,btohqsg
OK.  Thanks all. Guess those property ads saying buy condo without touching savings are all bull shit.,btohqsg
I will continue to live in my humble Hdb üòä,btohqsg
Hi I just sold my HDB and looking for a place to invest/stay. Currently renting a flat paying $1800 every month. Have 100k cash for downpayment. Bank loan up to 1.7m,btohqsg
Hi  I'm currently looking for loan for my business. I'm in the food industry  and currently doing well but suddenly I have more orders to fulfil. Which is good but dun have the funds to fulfil the orders. Contract is with government/semi-government . I have every supporting documents and contracts. We are open to any repayment schemes.Etc:‚Ä¢loan amount + interest- I'll settle the loan amount with interest.‚Ä¢loan amount + percentage of business- ill give a few percentage of the business  till the loan is fully paid.We can meet up  I can provide you all documents. You can verify everything first.Urgently in need of help..Pls PM me thxüôèüôè,btohqsg
Not bullshit  u read the advert it says no or little money downIt‚Äôs coz u sell ur HDB then get the sales proceed to fund your condoBuying a condo is not difficult. A nice one at Sengkang or Punggol is abt $800k  if you have a HDB now at $300k plus  u can sell and fund the downpayment for the condoJust not a good way to build wealth,btohqsg
For those sell one HDB to buy twoIt‚Äôs referring to couples who decouple  meaning one buy one condo each. So hubby one condo  wife buy one condo.This is to avoid absd and Low LtV for 2nd property.This is doeable only if both person individual income are high and both don‚Äôt mind high bank leverage,btohqsg
The easiest is to go99.coorPropertyGuru.com.sgand search for properties that you are keen in the area u want to liveThen go through the listing and visit those properties that you are keen in,btohqsg
Instead of 2nd property  consider buying reits as your ‚Äú2nd property‚Äù for rental income ba,btohqsg
Talk to the bank you are having a bank account for a TBL temporary bridging loan or a SME working loan or SME capital loanMy Loans just got approved by DBS 2 mths ago and by UOB ydayIt‚Äôs easier to get business loan nowAnd the interest is very Low,btohqsg
Letting go of BTC at slightly lower than market rate! If keen pls PM! :),btohqsg
Have credit card can just call the credit card company for balance transfer.1% processing fee for 6 mths  0% interestUsually takes only 2 working days to reach,btohqsg
