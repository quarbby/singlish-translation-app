Chill bro. Dont so agitated. U can give free or u can give cheap price. Maybe they dont understand ur ‚Äúceramic coating‚Äù initially is the spray one. If urs is the small bottle legit ceramic application with polish @ 20$ spoil market nobody like. One ceramic coating plus polishing can goes 300 plus. U put $20 ppl also like sus. Since u said ‚Äúspray‚Äù ok lor understand why $20.,btohqsg
Morning guys have a great day ahead it‚Äôs Friday !,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not abt the price high or Low  is abt worth it or not. People willing to spend more for the car  our car all is easily more than 80k. So in some thinking is that I apply free or cheap product on my car body paint later spoil or wad then fcking not worth it. I rather go for more expensive and big Brand‚Äôs that I know then at least I have the reassurance of the thing won‚Äôt harm my car,btohqsg
Before u buy any cheap or like u felt too good to be true products  always remember  is it worth or not.,btohqsg
I keep telling myself keep it cheap possible whenever but once comes to payment and I see the mechanic go their way out do my car swee swee I always feel bad for them and charge me so cheap and I tell myself cnt pay cheap alr  this must give tips alr.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt because some cheap cheap item then spoil the car. Exterior still okay. Anything touch the engines  the brakes etc. don‚Äôt play,btohqsg
Ytd they supposed to charge me 5 guages 150 labour fee  but I they say 4 guages so 125  so I ownself volunteer tell them I feel bad making you guys work so hard and long for my car  now you charge me cheap cheap can  I will give you guys tips,btohqsg
To me  friend is friend  support is support. To support a friend  don‚Äôt ask for discount; if he give it  don‚Äôt question or ask for more. That‚Äôs a basic. People open business also need to earn money one  let them earn what they deserve. Even if u think it‚Äôs cheap  if he‚Äôs the one giving the price of the cost  then just pay it. Can maintain the rs by giving gifts during the festival seasons or etc,btohqsg
But tony case I can say he's also going all out to give cheap ceramic coating  I myself will feel bad to pay him such price.,btohqsg
I know sonax is expensive and doing the coating isn't easy job for everyone. So I don't mind paying more for that,btohqsg
I never tell the price I want  I just tell them what I want and what I request. The price u decide. U want to give me cheap because I‚Äôm a friend I‚Äôm good. U want to charge me normal cause u running a business I‚Äôm also ok.,btohqsg
Hahha if cheap and do good  I give tips,btohqsg
At the end of the day  I dw the person to have that mindset that Wah cb  do this waste so much time and never profit much and my side is like Wah  so expensive or like not worth it sia u know,btohqsg
We pay so much for the car alr  might as well pay more to make ourself feel reassured that our car are done properly and professionally,btohqsg
If every car owners have this kind of mindset  I think the world can be in a better place,btohqsg
Some got cars alr still ‰∏çË¶ÅËÑ∏ keep asking for discount,btohqsg
That one I don't like  if me as mechanic cfm will do the much minimum and bare basic for the car,btohqsg
Must tell them  will pay what u should earn  but u also need to deliver what u had earn,btohqsg
Hahaha like what you said lo ‰∏ÄÂàÜÈí±‰∏ÄÂàÜË¥ß,btohqsg
I learned the hard way. I trusted a workshop to things i requested  bodykits  car spray. I even experience engine fault and also brakes never eat. Paid an amount of 4k for bodykit installation and spray paint  they still can fucked it up. Check on brakes ‚Äúall ok bro‚Äù.Sometimes is not about the price  its the workmanship and attitude.Went to KGC to fix my bumper and alignt etc cost me $500 plus per bumper and spray. While i went to a another place offer me $300+ for the same service  and it turns out better than i expected.Sometimes is not just about the money  is about the attitude. So if u wanna spray ur car  fix ur bumper  tinting  wrapping  do contact@JasonCai. No regrets going to him.,btohqsg
eh ya... i think i want to respray my car. lol,btohqsg
Find@JasonCaireally worth ur money  ur time  and he takes care of ur car like his own,btohqsg
No obligation  you do can ring me up or pm me ü§ó,btohqsg
thank you sir. will pm u when ready. i resolve my engine oil burning issue first loll,btohqsg
I close eye pretend no see. Hahagaga,btohqsg
Sure bro . Settle those important stuff first,btohqsg
To me for car  performance more important then anything,btohqsg
This is what the workshop did. Improper job for a 4k,btohqsg
haha yea inside done liao then do outside. every now and then need to top up eo very painful.,btohqsg
Not scaring you but better check it first . The only thing worried might need overhaul engine,btohqsg
This was after jason did it,btohqsg
no worries  already intend to overhaul actually.,btohqsg
Replica bodykits can never be perfect  but jason did it his best to give as perfect ss possible,btohqsg
So is not about the amount. Any amount u paid but u can never beat someone who put it effort in it.,btohqsg
Previous was 1 week 3 days  just to fix their shit which they didnt,btohqsg
Allergy or just random sinus attack?,btohqsg
For random sinus attack  i would just do plank to divert the blood away from the nasal area,btohqsg
Maybe sleeping will solve my issue,btohqsg
Ohh. That one I dunno how to help  but I got a sinus spray. I always use that whenever I have serious sinus in the morning,btohqsg
take some multi vits. since i take i got lesser already,btohqsg
U NEVER SEE I ONLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT. üò≠ day time i got work so i lanlan stay alive. But i omly stay indoors. Ask me stand in sun is wan my life.,btohqsg

Not fun. Need mind and cash,btohqsg
wa pour no need to see,btohqsg
what kind of PPE she wearing,btohqsg
actually the crz is also a nice looking car,btohqsg
Not a fan of crz...it is a hybrid if I recall correctly,btohqsg
Crx much more appeal to OG old school incle üòÇ,btohqsg
Wait until it leak and need 3D print,btohqsg
No need beetec la .crx just slow cruise can liao,btohqsg
"even if they got vtec is not the ""Vtec""",btohqsg
now vtec not same as last time liao,btohqsg
what you want is VTEC... not vtec,btohqsg
it uses same L15 engine as fit,btohqsg
Actually a very capable car. Just got hated a lot on when it released  cos back then hybrid still new,btohqsg
Lolx ..still not a fan of hybridüòÇ,btohqsg
Lolx .....mild or not...dun make a difference to meüòÇ,btohqsg
Still got engine sound and exos sound,btohqsg
and with motor assistance means more torque,btohqsg
Idk also. Alot of cars now with mild hybrid ma,btohqsg
tiny bit nia  since engine is always running,btohqsg
If wan save fuel..I ride bicycle liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
u will oso use more fuel (food),btohqsg
Everyone wants a nice sporty car  but dowan to pay high fuel prices,btohqsg
If idw save fuel  i'd be driving a rotary liao,btohqsg
Rotary ..the least of the concern be fuel actuallyüòÇ,btohqsg
to me get the crz is just to have something different,btohqsg
actually no sia. The fuel is a big concern,btohqsg
i almost bought a CRZ  but it was CVT,btohqsg
went to view  ended up didn't wanna buy,btohqsg
Lolx..wait til u own one u uds why I said fuel be the least of ur concerns,btohqsg
I know of many people that have a rotary,btohqsg
Have to rebuild ard every 70k,btohqsg
70k you take how long to reach,btohqsg
Apex seal ain't the sturdiest thing ard,btohqsg
and the rebuild is easier compared to piston engine,btohqsg
then your car 10 years coe 700k KM ah,btohqsg
but 5 or 6 years 1 time,btohqsg
Try shipping in from states n Japan..1 week.nowadays,btohqsg
it's not that big of a problem,btohqsg
your problem is 5km/l fuel consumption,btohqsg
people 1 week pump 1 tank,btohqsg
My problem is never abt fuelüòÅ,btohqsg
how is that not a problem,btohqsg
It is how durable is the engine...n downtime to repair..n cost of parts,btohqsg
I average abt 250km a day..u go count..üòÅ,btohqsg
this kind of every few years 1 time thing not a big concern,btohqsg
you clock so much mileage but dowan hybrid,btohqsg
To u maybe..hahaham.i merely seeing things in my point of viewüòÅ,btohqsg
As mentioned..fuel is the least of my concernüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Got frens who own one and actual ownership is gonna be 2 very different experiences üòÅ,btohqsg
So your main concern is need a car can run 24/7 365 days a year forever,btohqsg
ReliabilityAvailable parts in ex stock in SingaporeDown time to repair if got issuesReliable workshop who does things with care n expertise,btohqsg
Any FD owners if u want   pls PM me. BNIB. letting go  cheap.,btohqsg
Really bread and butter car lor,btohqsg
that's why fit a good choice,btohqsg
I can understand from your POV.,btohqsg
Maybe cos you old and retired from tiong chia life liao. Idk. But every car surely will appeal to some people one la,btohqsg
Lolx..u know when u own oneüòÅ,btohqsg
For me is if I got money I cfm will get a rotary  but i just dont,btohqsg
Time and parts availability not an issue for me,btohqsg
even mx5 alr sit in workshop 2 weeks before liao,btohqsg
I also just take MRT nia,btohqsg
I still young  want to play car,btohqsg
I got the money but I refused to get one..hahahahaha.. opposite...time to me is important..I buy car to use..not as museum relicüòÅ or display purposes üòÅ,btohqsg
So my concern very different from you,btohqsg
Boost the local economy is good for every oneüòÅ,btohqsg
that's why our mindset different lor,btohqsg
some people only want A to B,btohqsg
I did not mention it is the same..üòÅ,btohqsg
some people like hot exotic model girlfriends with high maintenance,btohqsg
I prefer not to be have any,btohqsg
Ok gib u see real one,btohqsg
Seen a silver one ard tooüòÇ,btohqsg
Seem like alot of swift lovers üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya. He just change the rim,btohqsg
oh really! haha. yea he went Wei's for alignment last month.,btohqsg
exterior la. haha i didnt go n kpo the interior.,btohqsg
I know him from group chat. I didn‚Äôt meet them. Cause I driving fit ahha,btohqsg
Good to drive before. But don‚Äôt feel like owning one,btohqsg
change to something not that old,btohqsg
those that still drive old cars are really more for the passion.,btohqsg
And need a lot of cash haha,btohqsg
if dont talk about money  why some people rather fd2r to fk8 when fk8 is clearly a more capable car.,btohqsg
He also friends with philip they all one ma,btohqsg
The workshop they frequent also end up a few FC RX7 maintain there one. Cos their people in their clique owns the RX7,btohqsg
I hanged out with them once. HAHAHAHA behsai. All too rich alr,btohqsg
they are a group of young guys who love old cars haha,btohqsg
i can appreciate but totally wont own one again,btohqsg
6mth of eg6 ownership enough liao.,btohqsg
old man also like young car leh..,btohqsg
That's why i didn't wanna go so old.,btohqsg
i think 2000s still relatively ok,btohqsg
90s and 80s too old alr,btohqsg
even getting a zc31 after the eg6 felt so much better overall,btohqsg
but 90s is golden era for JDM.. many classic good car in this era,btohqsg
swift is a good next gen replacement for EGs,btohqsg
it was golden when it was golden.,btohqsg
actually ah. I think if you really think carefully,btohqsg
Supra  GTR34  Evo9 all these in 2000s one lehh,btohqsg
toyota leading in the new era now. supra  86  corolla  yaris,btohqsg
I wish i can afford one,btohqsg
Actually all these cars are overrated,btohqsg
Only the supra is something to love but that‚Äôs thanks to b58,btohqsg
I think they are popular for a reason one ba. Hahaha,btohqsg
But i kinda want a GR Copen more,btohqsg
The GR copen situation in singapore pissed me off,btohqsg
And I'm so happy Elementz motor stuck with so many unsold unit,btohqsg
i think the GR yaris was overhyped. and sold at a ridiculous price locally,btohqsg
i'd pick the gr corolla over it.,btohqsg
all cars are price ridiculously here,btohqsg
a couple on sgcarmart within a month or 2,btohqsg
People who buy gr yaris mostly have super cars lol,btohqsg
And they know they can profit off COE as it climbs,btohqsg
car prices abit crazy within this 2 years,btohqsg
It‚Äôs meant to be an affordable mass market car that‚Äôs fun,btohqsg
And gives you a rally like handling,btohqsg
Toyota only made it in limited quantities,btohqsg
So they had to cover back their R&D prices with just a few thousands unit sold,btohqsg
and if you think about performance vs price.,btohqsg
FK8R and STI are at the same prices as the Yaris,btohqsg
So i dont think it's overpriced,btohqsg
I think it's fair  but yeah I can't afford it  so I'm not hating it,btohqsg
in terms of price  for sure could be expensive. but i believe the gr cars that came out are all very capable cars,btohqsg
Now what i believe the corolla will be cheaper than a yaris  because it's a mass produced unit,btohqsg
I just think it doesn‚Äôt justify the price tag   (although I can afford it),btohqsg
i see it as like the normal civic and the civic typer,btohqsg
or the lancer and the evo,btohqsg
yaris will be overshadowed by corolla. for sure,btohqsg
now gr yaris also like forgotten already,btohqsg
the corolla is a nice looking car,btohqsg
Do you see anyone talking about it,btohqsg
Even the owners who own it,btohqsg
cheap japanese performance cars is no longer a thing anymore,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt hate on it because they paid for it  but they won‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs worth every $ paid,btohqsg
it went quiet real quick. maybe become garage queen?,btohqsg
swift sport fills in this gap,btohqsg
They mostly bought to drive the problem is,btohqsg
but it doesn't match a 300hp turbo car,btohqsg
new 2.5L very good but too bad road tax is based on cc here,btohqsg
the swift will be forgotten also. They will be like the starlets and colts of yesteryears,btohqsg
but cars like GC8 and Evo 3 from same era still being worshipped,btohqsg
among new hot hatches  swift sport still considered to be affordable.,btohqsg
and about the GR Yaris being quiet  also doesn't help that there's less than 30 units in singapore,btohqsg
and no tuning potential due to singapore laws,btohqsg
it's still very much talked about in Europe,btohqsg
as people are still chasing horse powers,btohqsg
400hp from a 3cyl 1.6T is a very crazy thing to think about,btohqsg
and it's being achieved reliably in europe now,btohqsg
we'll wait and see if any turn up at the upcoming trackdays,btohqsg
Most of them buy as garage queens,btohqsg
