My quick car wash method is about 15mins.Prepare 3 cloths (2 cheap 1 premium)Prep: car soap water mixture in a water pump spray (those that can be used to water plants)$2.$1 HDB spray gun wet car bodySpray soap all aroundUse the first cheap cloth to wipe stubborn dirt's that can be removed with soapThen $1 spray gun again.Then use the 2nd cheap cloth to dry the car. Squeeze the towel to dry.Then use the expensive towel to wipe dry for spotless clean.These is my procedure before I cover my car.,btohqsg
