compared to AC or even GT,btohqsg
ohhhâ€¦ i see i see so AC is still a better choice. and basically if we want to sim for sepang then PC is the only option to go?,btohqsg
that would be the best way to go,btohqsg
howâ€™s the sepang track for AC? been updated or still running the file from 2017?,btohqsg
not too bad  but it's not the latest,btohqsg
ahhâ€¦ wonder if anyone would actually update it,btohqsg
there have been superficial attempts to get it visually up to date,btohqsg
