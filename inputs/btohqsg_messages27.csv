Hi everyone quick qns. I am a second timer and used MCPS to buy my 1st BTO.Now that I MOP redy  when I apply in Oct launch as second timer  the HDB portal is asking again if I want to apply under MCPS.What should I do?,btohqsg
You still qualify for MCPS for the current BTO you wanna select?,btohqsg
hi I applied for June bto! August I got my ballot number September end I got an appointment date  my booking was just recently on 14 Oct:),btohqsg
Confirm huat. Price also not bad. Waiting time 38months only,btohqsg
How much do you think the future price would be?,btohqsg
Btw  the seaview havnt include the view of msia and pulau ubin,btohqsg
Depends how long after results that HDB starts selection (they will stagger diff projects start month) + how good your queue number is,btohqsg
Hi all..this should answer yes or no ...own a bto and applying as 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi owner! I'm one of the admins you added. Could you pls PM me so I could ask about adding some filters to Rose to minimize spam? Thank you!!,btohqsg
Can check when u apply HFE  if 9 months ltr ur financial situation changed such that ur household income isn't below $14k  can u still bto/resale for govt flats?,btohqsg
Hi just wanna ask if now I apply for October bto   but if I also want apply for sbf for the Feb 25 bto is it possible but will it still be consider as first timer or second ?,btohqsg
IF your q no for Oct is out of supply  you can apply for SBF/BTO for Feb and you will be 1st timerIF your q no for Oct is within supply  cannot apply,btohqsg
Ooh okay thanks . But is only after the ballot then get queue number right ?,btohqsg
Yep roughly almost 2 months after application,btohqsg
Hi if deferred income  roughly when will they start assessing the income?,btohqsg
Taman jurong skyline so low rate üòÖ,btohqsg
This one best to ask HDB directly!,btohqsg
Ya la. But roughly can predict it‚Äôs one of the unpopular projects. I think biggest reason is 4+yrs waiting time.,btohqsg
Hi may I ask  is there any difference between the 1st and 2nd Applicants stated in the HFE?,btohqsg
not much diff - 1st applicant usually will be the correspondence in terms of providing address for hdb to send letters and all,btohqsg
But can those details be changed anywhere or anytime during application process?,btohqsg
not sure  didnt change till i signed,btohqsg
Hello all  can check? So ethnic group is to choose during application period like now? But my friend just applied  no option on this part when they're applying (but they're both indian)  where's mine is chinese malay.,btohqsg
The marsiling site used to be a primary school  already demolished.,btohqsg
I am already waiting for UV to be ready  already got a flat in that project.,btohqsg
does anyone know when the bto will start to register?,btohqsg
Most probably near the end of Oct,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I apply wrongly  can cancel and apply again ?,btohqsg
Best to apply on last day so u can think carefully before submit,btohqsg
Hi anyone have the floor plan or layout plan of the today BTO Oct 2024 launch especiallyBayshore PalmKembanganCrawford height,btohqsg
Anyone know beside Bayshore Vista there is a Medical health care centre is it Polyclinic or Elderly Home ?,btohqsg
If you go to project page  scroll down past the pictures til you can select the room type  then choose the room type  it will show the room layoutExample of room layout shown below (from Pasir Ris Oct 2024),btohqsg
4 rm (394 units)Internal floor area 90sqm$481k - $595k,btohqsg
anyone knows if can we locate each storey unit plan ?,btohqsg
Not sure why a medical facility is there but curious is it for Elderly home ...and then there is Rental Units ..are they for Low income family can rent from HDB ?,btohqsg
Not out yet  it'll be released sometime after results,btohqsg
Not sure why the Architect place the Multi storey Carpark and the BiN  right in front of Sea View together with a Proposed Health & Medical Care ..with the 3 block behind .. much to the anticipated East Coast View with 20 Rental Units and 21 storey high only,btohqsg
Acts as a buffer from expressway,btohqsg
Can be quite noisy at ecp,btohqsg
Ok .... maybe I go for Crawford,btohqsg

In the end rly down to luck still. Extra ballot chances help in the sense that you have more chances for your name to be drawn  but imagine 1:1000 people applying vs 2:1000 people applying  the % increase in probability is not much. Of course if application rate is low eg 200 ppl apply  1:200 vs 2:200  more ballot chances will affect more greatly,btohqsg
Does anyone have 121e Tengah floor plan ?,btohqsg
Perhaps you wanna ask in your project grp chat?,btohqsg
Asking the same too  if applying as first timer for bto but already have old hdb?,btohqsg
If application for project is less than 70% of the units  will they cancel the project?,btohqsg
hihi  can i check in the bto application  you can only select the estate  and not the specific project within the estate?if thats the case then does that mean you can only get 1 queue number for only 1 project within the estate?,btohqsg
U will only get 1 queue number and u can choose the project u wanna apply for if ur number is good,btohqsg
Dont think they will cancell  still build and rest for SBF maybe,btohqsg
Only day 1  the numbers will rise soon,btohqsg
Yep  the current flat was resale. Oh  i thought first timer means nvr took grant from hdb before eh,btohqsg
I think better call hdb if any doubt,btohqsg
The jurong area seems like not very popular üòÅ,btohqsg
Is there any fernvale groups yet for Oct 24 bro?,btohqsg
Low subs not good? I hope the project I apply only have me one person applicant then can get queue 1 ü§£,btohqsg
Low subs is great but too low scared cancel project HAHA,btohqsg
Skyline shiok honestly 40 stories 5 room also cheap,btohqsg
Government say they won‚Äôt cancel project the project  all BTO already started tender/building before they launched. Cause BTO no one take SBF will still fully taken.$290 k jurong 4R BTO who don‚Äôt want? Now resale min $600 k in jurong area.,btohqsg
Jurong is not bad. 290k for 4room. Minus grant 100k. 190k,btohqsg
That's if u can get the full grant?,btohqsg
Do u need to return the grant?,btohqsg
How come i cant find FPPS priority scheme in the application? Anyone know?,btohqsg
Need to return to ur own cpf when u sell the bto.,btohqsg
Its so far from any MRT tho.,btohqsg
Like within 1/2km got pcn to it,btohqsg
Its completed a few years within bto completion,btohqsg
Crl? Which station do u mean?,btohqsg
No lah! That one is far from the project,btohqsg
Do you have the link to bayshore group chat?,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone aware if EHG can be used as part of CPF savings to pay for initial 10% downpayment? üòÖAssuming the intention is to take HDB loan,btohqsg
Yes that's the intention of EHG - to offset down payment,btohqsg
I just looked on the map. Hes actually right  its about 500-600 m walk away but thete is no footpath across Jurong river,btohqsg
So its likely a very short bus ride across the river,btohqsg
oct bto open already? any idea when the exercise closes?,btohqsg
has anyone's HFE not come through if they applied before the 15 sept deadline?,btohqsg
Aye brooooo luckily tail of Jurong lake,btohqsg
Best to call HDB to check,btohqsg
May I ask if paying cash for bto  do we still need hfe? Hfe is to determine your affordability level  am I wrong? Your input is much appreciated.,btohqsg
Yes.You still need to apply for HFE even if you are paying cash.The HFE letter will state that you will not be taking any HBD loan.,btohqsg

U still need apply HFE .,btohqsg
u will have 2 queues or smth i believe?,btohqsg
one for mcps one for public,btohqsg
ABOUT GRO/MGPS/PUBLIC QUEUESüè† Grassroots Organisation (GRO) Scheme queueThis is a priority scheme reserved for grassroots leaders who have served for at least 3 years. There is not much information from a government source that is publicly available (other thanthis)  but the GRO queue always goes first in a selection. It's not all dandy though - they only can select from a list of preselected units.Additional info:¬ª The GRO queue always starts fromQ0001.üè† Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) queue(s)Applicants of this scheme select a 2-room flat or larger  together with their parents who select a 2-room or 3-room flat. The MGPS queue starts after the GRO queue ends  with 2+x going first  followed by 3+x. Similar to GRO scheme applicants  MGPS applicants are also limited by a preselected list of units. You may read more about the MGPShere.Additional info:¬ª The parents' flat type determines which queue an MGPS application is under  e.g. if parents chose 3-room  the application will be under the 3+x queue.¬ª The 2+x queue comprises (2+2)  2+3  2+4  and 2+5  while the 3+x queue comprises (3+2)  3+3  3+4  3+5.¬ª The configurations in brackets are technically possible  though rare.About MGPS queue numbers:¬ª Each queue (2+x and 3+x) isindependent of each other  i.e. the first of each queue can be Q0001  though not necessarily.¬ª To be more precise  the MGPS queue numbers follow from the last GRO queue number of theparent flat type. For example  if there are 5 3R GRO  then the MGPS 3+x queue will start from Q0006.üè† Public QueueThis is everything else! After the GRO and MGPS selections are over  all untaken units are now 'free for all'. You usually can tell when public queue has started when the units taken start to make 'more sense' (e.g. top floors of a 'better' stack going first).Alternatively  for those who have already gotten your appointment dates  you can also 'confirm' this by logging into the HDB portal  clicking on your application registration number  and seeing if you can view thelast queue number of the day. If you can  public queue has started.Additional info:¬ªAll priority schemesother than GRO or MGPS will fall under the public queue  e.g. PPS  MCPS.¬ª If there are 10 4R GRO applicants  and potentially 20 4R flats that may be selected during the MGPS queues  the first number in the 4R public queue will beQ0031.Last Updated: 20 Apr 2024  7:45 PM‚ÑπÔ∏èThe above is information that I (SM Chua a.k.a.@btoapptdateson Telegram) have put together from having been watching BTO selections for a while.

Divorce never apply bto before  77 yrs old  choose bto near married son,btohqsg
Thanks. But do you know usually like what kind of docs they require?,btohqsg
Went to dig out mine from 2022. It was1. Income documents from past 3 months & 12 months2. IC3.  EHG form4. Undertaking to not withdraw essential members of the flat formSince 2022 was still under HLE (where loan and grant are not done before application)  I believe 1 and 3 will no longer be applicable  since they would have been covered by HFE.So I think best if someone else who has an updated (after HFE started) invitation package can share the documents required,btohqsg

Price excluding grants and including grants is referring to first timers and second timersÔºåright?Cos I realised the grants difference is 80k for 2 to 4rmAnd 55k difference for 5rm,btohqsg
The difference between including and excluding grants is the (max) 120k EHG grant that's for 1st timers  yup,btohqsg
For everyone (1st timers) it's safer to look at excluding grants  as including grants price assumes you get a max of 120k  whereas most wont get that,btohqsg
120k is for couples earning less than 1.5k/mth,btohqsg

Hi  can i check;1) if we apply for BTO and got balloted  can we still apply for SOB at the same time?,btohqsg
Can provided that your BTO queue number is out of supply. If it is out of supply  whichever queue number comes first  you have to pick.,btohqsg
Unless your BTO Q is out of Q then u can apply for next launch,btohqsg
Everything can find online please go check.,btohqsg
Note that you can be included in multiple priority schemes should you fulfil the eligibility criteria across the schemes. For instance  for a first timer married couple balloting for a flat within 4km to their parent's place  you will be eligible for the FPPS and MCPS priority schemes which sets aside a total of 70% of the flat supply for you. In this case:1. You will first ballot for a queue number within the flat supply under the FPPS scheme where 40% of supply is set aside for FPPS applicants.2. If you fail in the FPPS ballot  you will move on to participate in the MCPS ballot where 30% of supply is set aside for MCPS applicants.3. Failing to ballot under the FPPS and MCPS  you will then ballot for around 20% of the remaining supply  together with the general public with no priority and those who failed in the priority ballots üòä,btohqsg
For MCPS  you will only qualify for this if you have opt-in when submitting your application and also have either of your/your partner's parents residing within 4km distance to any of the 3 bedok BTO projects. This will entitle you to participate in an additional ballot where 30% of the flats are set aside  giving you a higher chance of securing a queue number within the flat supply. Unlike MGPS  MCPS ballots are part of the public scheme and there are no restrictions on the flats you can choose. üòÄ,btohqsg
A quick summary on flats set aside under the common priority schemes for first timers  where 95% of flat supply is set aside:MGPS Scheme - Flats reserved for this is computed as 15% of number of 2 and 3 room flats  subject to a minimum of 20 flatsTCPS Scheme - 5%FPPS Scheme - 40% (FT(PMC) applicants will qualify for this)MCPS Scheme - 30% (Around 20% for PLH flat)More information on priority schemes are availablehere.,btohqsg
All the information u need is actually on HDB‚Äôs website  if u read thoroughly,btohqsg
With All  the Priority scheme and with The Additional Lucky Draw chance ..some given 2 chance or 3 chance in the ballot boxIs Still a Lucky Draw by chance regarding how many we have for our extra  tickets in the box ?Sometimes a Single ticket can strike the lottery ...is this how it is going to beOr it will be unfair advantage set aside for certain Priority more priority than other priorities scheme ?I am curious how the Ballot would be and the Q number ..who is the first Q1 to 10  to choose ...,btohqsg
95% is set aside for those with Priority scheme...?5% left for those with No Priority Scheme ?,btohqsg
The meant game over for me..I belong to the 5%Whoever that 5% got it is strike the lottery...Good luck to all,btohqsg
Btw  chance of getting your name drawn =/= how good your queue number will be,btohqsg
So could be that you're a lucky 2nd timer who gets a very good queue number,btohqsg
Thank you so much ..I hope you GOT it@berningbrightly,btohqsg

They say it is warmer for top level units - I am not sure if this is still true,btohqsg

Hi   may I ask if I used up this year for my current flat  assume next year I got my BTO key collection  can I claim it again?,btohqsg
Looking at the rate. Jurong west not very popular. Potentially can get for 1st timer that applied 3-5rooms,btohqsg
If first timer allocations not filled up  will that give second timers higher chances?,btohqsg
ya heard will end up as SBF,btohqsg
It will end up in SBF then OBF.,btohqsg
yes it will. see ulu pandan vista and Alexandra peaks from dec 2023,btohqsg
Must be willing to pay high cost bah if u want to engage engineer and Bca specialists all these.,btohqsg
Yeah  our government got regulate one. It‚Äôs just high cost.,btohqsg
Any other certs is just HDB DRC  and only specialised in demolition only. Masonry works got no governing body one haha. Have to be patient,btohqsg

Wah I thought as long only 300 applicant but 400 flat all will likely get the flat. Didn't know it will flow to sbf. For geylang meaning there is 14.5 for 2nd timer mean 14pax fighting for 1 unit?,btohqsg
Bedok 4 rooms.. sigh.. high demand..,btohqsg
Jurong West is like sure get,btohqsg
True. If any 1st timer that really want bto without relying on luck better choose jurong west,btohqsg
Yes. Limited allocation of unit for 2nd timer. 5-15% only.For example:4/5room allocation is 5% only.300 x 5% = 15 unit only for 2nd timer3room allocation is 15% only(standard bto).300 x 15% = 45 unit only for 2nd timer,btohqsg
üò≠looks like my chance is very lowww.,btohqsg
All along I thought 500 units than 400 applicant all will get it.,btohqsg

Just apply Jurong West. Highest chance to get any,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt be a first timer if you have taken HDB grant for your resale. But you should be under seniors. Have to call HDB to understand better however. Your situation is very unique for most of the people here to know how to advice  hope u get what u want,btohqsg
Refer to yr HFE letter. Go to ‚ÄúNew‚Äù tab instead of Resale. It state type of flat eligible to buy. If you are eligible for 2rm short lease or upto 99 years  refer to senior column and opt for senior priority scheme during application.,btohqsg
hey guys! came across something interesting  I noticed that the flat prices will increase from the lowest level to the highest  so far normal rightbut except for both the highest and second highest level flats  they are priced the sameanyone knows why?,btohqsg
Normally people prefer the second highest unit over the top floor,btohqsg
second highest unit is better if can choose?,btohqsg
That means HDB values them / feels that ppl value them equally highly,btohqsg
Up to individual  people feel that top floor can have issues like being hotter + leakage issues if roof draining is bad,btohqsg
not really.Same price but higher 1 floor and 1 less neighbor to deal with.From what I see  people who live top floor say it's better.,btohqsg
Maybe both but you only apply as singles or under senior,btohqsg
are yr parents applying within 4km of Bedok fm current residence?,btohqsg

hihi! would like to check if i‚Äôm applying for this BTO under the MCPS scheme to stay near my parents but they‚Äôre moving to a new BTO (key collection should be around dec this year to early jan next year) but both of the flats are within the 4km range. which flat do i indicate in my application?thanks in advance! üôèüèº,btohqsg

Why ? Is better u get or u don't have any Q numbers u know why ?

So 1236 Units of Q number + about 2000 more Q Number in case some give up the 4 years?@berningbrightlythank you for your reply,btohqsg

Hi  my seller had already claimed it  but NEA had a very detailedforms.govfor you to fill up. Took 2.5 weeks for mine to be approved,btohqsg
Can I ask for Senior like our parents who bought our childhood flat in the early 80'sBut did NOT loanAre they still consider 2nd Timer or is it still 1st Timer because never loan from HDB ?,btohqsg
They will give a max of 1236 x 3 = 3708 queue numbers. Could also be fewerWhen selection starts  they will call from #1  #2 etc. If everyone selects  then after #1236  there will be no more units. But if some people don't select  eg if #100 doesn't want to select  then #1237 will get to select.If you don't get to select at this point  and HDB closes the selection  the only way to get this flat is to apply through SBF / OBF if they release it then. These flats could be leftover (units ppl didn't want) or given-up (eg break up)I hope I interpreted your question correctly...,btohqsg
Yes exactly good answers to my questions...thank you@berningbrightly,btohqsg
no dont add up to 100% as 5% is for 2nd timer,btohqsg
without mcps for 2nd timer the quota is actually 2%,btohqsg
Strange tcps not in the table,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ Provides an additional ballot chance to secure a flat,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ Up to 5% of Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) flats allocated for families with at least 3 childrenProvides an additional ballot chance to secure a flat,btohqsg
2nd timer for BTO but 1st timer for loan which is subject to income and age eligibility,btohqsg
Ok good Q number  to All,btohqsg
Thank youDory...2% to that Very lucky 2nd Timer here ..come December please share your Good News !,btohqsg
"It's not additional ballot  it's like your name will be put into 2 ""bowls"" (MCPS and ""normal"" bowl)So you have 2 tries for them to draw a number for you from the bowls. Maybe balloting with the MCPS will end up giving you a better queue number?",btohqsg

Hi all  please help. I called HDB and was unable to get an answer from the officer.I'm newly self employed this year and don't have NOA yet  possible to apply for HFE to go for sales of balance next year Feb? My partner is only recently employed with only 1 month cpf credited  so by Jan only 4 months cpf credited.,btohqsg
U can apply for hfe. But u wont get the ehg grant as u or ur partner need to be working for 1 year to get the grant.If u dont mind the getting the grant then i suggest u just apply for the hfe at hdb website before the feb launch. If hdb needs any additional documents they will ask it from u,btohqsg
If self employed is it self declared income or need to show proof of earnings?,btohqsg
One more thing can i ask for home insurance can we get from other quotes instead of hdb recommendation ?,btohqsg
Ya can you mean from private insurance companies right?,btohqsg
Can apply for exemption from HPS if suitableIf taking HDB loan  still need apply HPS first though. Then apply exemption from HPS afterwards,btohqsg

Hi can I ask? For the OCS Scheme (flooring and internal components) do we have to pay when we book our flat or together with the final payment?,btohqsg
At the booking of flat only pay Option Fee depending on flat type. But you need to let them know by then if you want OCS. Den they will let you know how much your down payment (to pay at next appt within 9months),btohqsg
Ohh I see  thank you for the info! Appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
No payment when you select your unit. Just need to tell them yes OCS or no OCSOCS will be added to purchase price. Purchase price = unit price + OCS (if you opt in).fees + down payment will be tagged to the purchase price,btohqsg
Individual preference honestly. Some things to considerPros of OCS:- less Reno to think about when the time comes- faster to do Reno- should be cheaper (since it's priced at 2024 prices and not ECD pricesCons of OCS:- you have to go with the choice they give- more cost if you end up wanting to remove and re-do when flat is ready,btohqsg
Depends if u 5yrs wan sell kind to flip/upgradeOr u intend to stay for long kindSo u can factor ur reno cost üí≤ into it  & if it‚Äôs worth it anot,btohqsg

To those who've gotten their keys.. Does hdb often allow key collection earlier than the officially stated dates?,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs possible. In the past it was around one year before the estimated completion date. Nowadays idk,btohqsg
hello  does anyone know when the flat selection will start if we successfully get a queue number for the oct 2024 bto launch?,btohqsg
You can go through the past launches here and estimate:https://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
Hmm maybe can check with the stone companies themselves  who makes the biggest order,btohqsg
Stones usually can go for Polybuilding  Futar  Kstone  Hafary Group,btohqsg

Hi  I have a question. If I choose to reject my application for my OCT sales launch during balloting. When I apply again fr the nxt launch  will I be regarded as a second timer? And will there be a 1yr hold fr me before I apply?,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question. If I choose to reject my application for my OCT sales launch during balloting. When I apply again fr the nxt launch  will I be regarded as a second timer? And will there be a 1yr hold fr me before I apply?,btohqsg
Yes second timer. One year you will be classified as a second timer,btohqsg
U don't get to apply the next Launch when :1) u have a Q number within!So your question is if u have a Q number within and u give up never go for unit selection u banned for 1yr,btohqsg
2) When u are out of Q !Yes u can apply for next launchBUT IF U GET CALLED FOR SELECTION:  If u never go = your ongoing application all is cancelled automatically unless u can appeal if the balance unit is less then 10,btohqsg
Noted so the nxt time I apply  after the 1yr  I‚Äôll still be regarded as a first timer right,btohqsg
vin:https://vinfin1409.wixsite.com/website-1Photo from Vincent GooPhoto from Vincent Goo,btohqsg
Just FYI that this might be mid 2026 onwards (if that matters)  since the 1 year is counted from when you reject at the point of selection.Selection for Oct 2024 launch is likely to start in Feb/Mar 2025 earliest.,btohqsg

Hi..is it correct must pay 10% downpayment after 9 months from the day when selecting a unit for 2nd timer ...,btohqsg
Within 9 months. Could be earlier. Applies to both first and second timer.,btohqsg
Haiya..I thought can deferred til key collection..any advise whether can be done after selling my house when got key selection,btohqsg
Erm don‚Äôt think so. 10% is must unless you qualified for deferred scheme which officer will advise during flat booking. But since you‚Äôre second timer  don‚Äôt think you qualified.See how much in CPF can deduct for your down payment. Not enough den top up with cash.If you‚Äôre going for bank loan  den is 20%.,btohqsg
Thanks for the info..cpf only got 20k,btohqsg
Have not reach 55..thanks for the info,btohqsg

Hi all  question - say if my queue number is 480  and the total number of units is 481. Assuming nobody else forfeits their option and I‚Äôm left with the worst possible unit in a development.As a result of the above  I choose to not pick said unit. Will I be considered 2nd timer the next time I ballot?,btohqsg
No  cuz less than 10units available for you to choose.,btohqsg
Thank you for the info. So it's :1) Option Fee2) Down Payment3) Balance upon receiving keyCorrect?,btohqsg

Thinking if should try applying for the first time,btohqsg
Usually if HDB indicate proposed integrated hub bus interchange or food center all this. Will it actually happen by the time bto has been build finish?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in the pipeline. But hard to say,btohqsg
If one of the projects catch your eye  den just go for it.,btohqsg
Hmmm what does it mean by in the pipeline?,btohqsg
I think the location is abit ulu,btohqsg
Plan to have it. Dunno when will be built.,btohqsg

Hi hi can i ask which other banks (other than DBS) still provides reno loan?,btohqsg

Hello. Can I confirm that this also applies to Single? Single can apply and buy 2nd BTO from HDB after selling the 1st BTO?,btohqsg
This was in 2023 but it should still apply:https://blog.seedly.sg/renovation-loan-interest-rate-singapore/,btohqsg

Looking for thoughts  Is it ok to buy bto near a temple?,btohqsg
If looking for id can look for me ya,btohqsg
If looking for bank reno loan can look for me üëç,btohqsg
Ahh ok. No wonder I can‚Äôt find the confirmation on HDB website for single BTO  2nd timer. Ok thank you,btohqsg
Well it depends on your beliefs  tolerance and/or superstition? But to me  no matter what religion  be it temple  mosque  church  or any place of worship  it brings prosperity and tranquility..,btohqsg
for those who applied  anyone encounter missing profile pic already?,btohqsg
Temple or place of worship is okay . Dont think too much . Coz some flats were built on previous cemeteries and still no issues .My coming BTO in front will be a church and Malay cemetery no issues for me,btohqsg
Why? It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not indicative whether you get a ballot or don‚Äôt get a ballot. This has been debunked previously.,btohqsg
just curious... can share where or which project?,btohqsg
Gd evening all..Can a parent (already applied for HFE) apply under MGPS scheme  but the child has yet to sell her current house?,btohqsg
River peaks  at rochor / weld,btohqsg
After collecting the keys to your new flat  the parents or married child who has helped you to qualify for the MCPS must continue to live with you or within 4km of your new flat throughout the minimum occupation period of the new flat. In addition  they must not:Submit any application or be included as occupiers in any application to buy a flat directly from the HDB  a resale flat or an Executive Condominium unit  located more than 4 km from the new flatTake over the lease or tenancy of a flat (including DBSS flat) or an Executive Condominium unit located more than 4 km from the new flatIf the parent managed to get a flat under this scheme  the child cannot move away until MoP,btohqsg
That time got people told me got Chuch in front I say okay what I respect all religion and Xmas will be nice .Then other day got a Malay cemetery nearby ect,btohqsg
Oops Sorry!I think can apply first. No need to sell until then.,btohqsg
wow thats hot property right in the city and no PLH restrictions. u got a good buy,btohqsg
Great location but it‚Äôs PLH . 10 mop   can‚Äôt rent out whole unit   got 6 % penalty ect,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs okay lah . I going to stay there long . It‚Äôs only now need to wait till 2028 . My amk flat don‚Äôt know the sale price will drop or not,btohqsg

Dear all  any ideas if majority bto will complete before estimate TOP or after TOP?,btohqsg
How accurate the date? As I am choosing school for my kid,btohqsg
Hi it means after estimate TOP?,btohqsg
Every project is different and also depends on blks. Not all blks will TOP together as a whole.,btohqsg
Since your choosing the school  it‚Äôs best to only select closer to the date when you have gotten the confirm actual PCD month,btohqsg
I maybe wrong  but this is what I am going through  on newly launch project it‚Äôs called ECD(estimated completion date) closer to completion date the name will be change to PCD also known as probable completion date.,btohqsg

You have to follow the steps in the email exactly,btohqsg
You can only see it if you‚Äôre in ‚Äúmy flat dashboard‚Äù,btohqsg
followed already but what am i supposed to see as their update? üòÖ doesn't seem like there are any,btohqsg
You have to press on step 3,btohqsg
They will show you number of ballot chances and any priority schemes,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ i didn't know  keep finding for the said update lol,btohqsg
thank you so much! have a good weekend :),btohqsg
Hello can I ask usually if my ballot chances 2 what are my odds for getting the flat ?,btohqsg
Really hard to say‚Ä¶ depends how many applications also.And what your queue no would be.,btohqsg
Mine never show number of ballot chances only show elderly single priority scheme  mean good or no good?,btohqsg
What elderly priority Scheme mean? üôè,btohqsg
U applied for 2rm flexi? If yes  then that's your priority scheme,btohqsg
hihi  me & my partner have previously applied for the 2 prev launches earlier this year and didn‚Äôt get a queue number  but our ballot chances only shows 2 for the oct launch. is it supposed to be 4?,btohqsg
Were the launches in non-mature estates? And your current application is it standard?HDB gives extra ballot chances if those 2 criteria are met,btohqsg
And if you met the criteria  it would only have been 1 extra ballot chance. Cause HDB says this applies after 2 unsuccessful launches,btohqsg
oh! so the non-mature estates also matters? bcos i got from the HDB website that it only counts Standard Flats applications,btohqsg
previously we applied for both mature estates  but first one was under Prime scheme & the latter was under Standard scheme.,btohqsg
This is the part that's a bit unclear from the website.Im not sure if it'll reset,btohqsg
But even if it doesn't reset  then it should follow the old wording  which means must be non-mature,btohqsg
If someone else has experienced this situation - 2 times unsuccessful non-mature and currently standard  but still have no extra ballot chances for it  that would clear things up! (On whether it reset or continues on),btohqsg
no worries  i‚Äôll call HDB again to clarify as well. thank you for ur help!,btohqsg
Yes that would be good :),btohqsg
Hi  if I didn't reach step 4 mean I did not get BTO? Thank in advance.,btohqsg
Good morning Jo  have u find any updates? I manage to view application detail  but not sure what update being done,btohqsg
Hi I just wanted to check if I‚Äôm a second timer because I didn‚Äôt select a flat previously  do I still get the EHG grant? Or does it affect my grant amount?,btohqsg
Hi I just wanted to check if I‚Äôm a second timer because I didn‚Äôt select a flat previously  do I still get the EHG grant? Or does it affect my grant amount?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it affect the grant amount. Second timer penalty is on the balloting for queue,btohqsg
Hi  you will still get your grants. Just that your queue priority shifts to become like a second timer.,btohqsg
as mentioned by gera it's the ballot chance and scheme!,btohqsg
Thank you for the information üôèüèΩ,btohqsg

Thanks for deleting. Coz i scare people go message that guy and get scammed,btohqsg
2-Room Flexi for Bukit batok west brickville has 130 units  priced around $49 000 to $217 000,btohqsg
Toilet wooden door easily get damaged and rusty due to moisture and water. Does anyone has reliable contractor to make gd @ reasonable price with warranty on workmanship,btohqsg
Is there discussion group for rental flat after selection of BTO?,btohqsg
To add on for brickville there are 91 units type 2,btohqsg
Not much as compared to taman jurong 390 units type 2,btohqsg
Yes   this 16 Dec   going down HDB,btohqsg
First choice was woodland ( rejected)Second now is bukit batok,btohqsg
you got an appointment to select flat?,btohqsg
I thought the Q no results are not yet released?,btohqsg
I received on 01dec2024 already asked me to go down on 16dec to HDB,btohqsg
this is for october 2024 bto?,btohqsg
I choose June @ woodland ( rejected )So again Oct reselect @ bukit batok ( date 16dec to HDB),btohqsg
Q results are not out yet. No updates from the brickville chat either. Doubt it,btohqsg
even if results out the appointment wont be so soon,btohqsg
I always find the single applicants for bb brickville interesting. With the allocation  50/130 for 2r flexi  you have to be really really lucky to secure a unit when the application rate is 36.2. The faster waiting time of 24 months could be a trap. On the other hand this group of applicants didn't cancel still and change to jurong skyline on the last day. Thus resulting in higher chances for the skyline applicants,btohqsg
If hdb gives que numbers of up to 300% of supply  I think singles could have better chances than 1.7 rate. But whether the unapplied slots for the other categories go to singles or sbf I think we‚Äôll only know when results out,btohqsg
Gonna be interesting to see a block with majority singles lol,btohqsg
Wah the application results for Oct launch is out??,btohqsg
Yes I received  their ask me go on 16 Dec,btohqsg
Means you got a queue to select flat unit?,btohqsg
Is this correct of what we are talking about ???,btohqsg
This is the date to put $500 and select,btohqsg
Did u also receive any email to inform u your queue number?,btohqsg
Thank you   wish your all the best asap receive good result and progress,btohqsg
Ohhh tis is June.. cos I saw it state ‚Äúpublic scheme‚Äù so I tot is the latest one cos e name abit different,btohqsg
On the 1st one at wld is 625/606 after Oct state failed after state again not eligibleThen Oct ask to rebookSo I Oct rebook and ask to wait for result on DecSo I received 02 Dec asked me go on 16dec to HDB,btohqsg
Oh so is for the same flat right,btohqsg
I am thinking if they put public scheme means there are other scheme available   not sure the differences. Cos previously they dun put public scheme.. Mayb changed layout or something,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your queue no for the appt for 16th?,btohqsg
Oh BB is not e same launch as the prime and plus all that right,btohqsg
Never put   but ask me go on 16dec,btohqsg
I would think it‚Äôs for your woodlands,btohqsg
Should have queue no also if for BB,btohqsg
Really meh ?If is wld it will be more  better,btohqsg
Scare me sia thot results out le.. zzz,btohqsg

Show us that the appointment is for bukit batok brickville,btohqsg
Oct rebook for BBThen Dec say 16dec to hdb,btohqsg
Show us that your appointment is for brickville,btohqsg
Because the Q results not even released,btohqsg
Your woodlands queue was slightly out of supply. Could be letting you also apply for the Oct‚Äôs also.But due to drop outs  so you are able to go for woodlands booking instead,btohqsg
After wld was rejected Ôºå on Oct I choose this,btohqsg
Show us that your 16 Dec appointment is for BB brickville,btohqsg
How can it be when Q results not even released yet??,btohqsg
Not rejected since got queue no. Just out of supply.Go find out how many left for woodlands then you see if you still get to choose on 16th,btohqsg
I also feel so.. cannot b no queue number den ask u go down,btohqsg
This don't mention anything abt BB brickville,btohqsg
Meaning I still can take wld ??,btohqsg
If by 16 still got left,btohqsg
Show us that your 16 Dec appt is for BB brickville ???,btohqsg
I see already never put any thinkBut I very sure this is Oct booking for BB,btohqsg

FCS (Joint Balloting)  to be introduced in end-2025  will replace the MGPS and allow parents and their children to apply for two units in the same BTO project  where there are 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats.,btohqsg
But doesn‚Äôt really say singles can apply for what kind of flats,btohqsg
Ya still 2room. But I think no limit on the location unlike previously?,btohqsg
resale is more expensive.. traditionally bto is reserved for families and govt has been relaxing the rules more and more for singles. it started with singles being able to buy resale hdb to bto in non-matured estates and now singles can even apply bto in all locations.,btohqsg
true la.. hope you get your 2room as i understand its quite competitive for singles.. luckily i bought in 2018 and its a 6 figure jump for current context,btohqsg
so u got it already ah? whats the 2nd one?,btohqsg
Beside it is temple. And nearby is all old flats. Is a street road jurong west,btohqsg
Seems no amenities also. More ulu than taman.,btohqsg
hello! just hoping for some input - we were just given an appointment date on 18 Dec for June 2024 BTO  but we also applied for Oct 2024 BTO under MCPS. Does HDB give allowance and give non-selection waiver if we get a better queue number under the Oct 2024 sales exercise?ü•≤,btohqsg
Non selection waiver is only if there are 10 units and less when it comes to your appt to select flat,btohqsg
OCT‚Äôs Ballot results maybe not out yet by your appt date‚Ä¶,btohqsg
whats ur queue for june and which project did you apply in oct? did u use mcps for june?,btohqsg
This is tricky question. 18 December the Oct ballot result may or may not be released yet,btohqsg
If it is released and like what she said she got a good queue number,btohqsg
Then I am not sure hdb handle it,btohqsg
If by your selection  you still have more than 10 units to select from  you have to select a unit.If less than 10  you can forfeit without penalty.Penalty is: All ballots on hand immediately cancelled and become 2nd timer status in ballot for one year.,btohqsg
Means there no such thing as waiver for better queue no. As long the appt you can ballot   you have to,btohqsg
The only way you can waive for non selection is if your Appt on 18 Dec   there are only 10 or less units left to select,btohqsg
right  guess it's just wait and see if Oct results are already released by the appointment date. if yes then can at least write in and appeal to HDB if MCPS gives us a better queue. Otherwise it's select unit (if >10 units left for ethnic quota) or reject and become 2nd timer with the Oct 2024 application cancelled also. Thanks everyone!,btohqsg
feels like we're a little stuck cause the drop out rate for June project is starting to climb already hahaha. left with undesirable units in front of rubbish chute ü•≤,btohqsg
Your appt is 2 weeks time. There is still a chance for the remaining units to get taken up. In that case then you don't even have to go for the appt,btohqsg
You should check the units available prior to your appt and the ethnic quota as well,btohqsg
looks like no chance although they might back more appointments subsequently,btohqsg
still got chance >10 units in 2 weeks' time... that's why feel quite stuck haha,btohqsg
can check last queue of the day by logging in,btohqsg
which project is that.. you are lucky to get an in supply queue.. it is also in line with hdb's policy of dont anyhow apply if not ready to commit to it,btohqsg
about 300+ haha. hopefully racial quota run out first,btohqsg
Don't worry so much. My queue number was 569/297 for Teban project June BTO. HDB contacted me to go appt for this Friday as well. There were 20 units left. However  within the next 3 working days  all 20 units were sold. No need to go appt .,btohqsg
true  we are lucky to even be invited! the Oct project we applied for is at least close to one set of parents so if can get better queue for that project then we'd prefer that honestly  parents getting older also,btohqsg
June project is better for us location wise if we just focus on our nuclear family,btohqsg
If your queue number is far away  like my situation  all units could be sold before your appt. You should check the units and quota prior to your appt,btohqsg
Hi  is the HLE valid only for 9months?If we apply by 15 Dec  the validity period would not cover until 2025 Oct BTO application.Am i Right?,btohqsg
Ya. But can reapply one week before it expires. Btw it‚Äôs called HFE now,btohqsg
There's an admin fee?So we pay twice for 1 year's try.Also pay for BTO application.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs admin fee. Only when apply BTO den got application fee,btohqsg
Hiii  my hfe is expiring on 20 Dec. Can I renew it or I have to reapply HFE?,btohqsg
Only one week before it expires  then there will be renew button? As I currently can't find any renew button.,btohqsg
Currently I login  it says1. View hfe letter2. Reapply HFE,btohqsg
You have to re apply a new HFE. Enter all information again. There is no renew,btohqsg
Just like how you do it the first time,btohqsg
Anyone knows for single   the price for that unit in the website is included 15k or not? I read somewhere that it is already included?,btohqsg
I read thru the whole discussion. I suggest that u join or check Marsiling Peak telegram group  then u will know that 16 Dec is for it  as there's a queue number tracker there which will show that people around your q number of 625 get the similar appointment date.,btohqsg
"No offense but I think the term you used  such as ""rejected""  ""rebook"" etc may not the best term as they caused the confusion. I guess the whole scenario is like this: u applied June woodlands Bto  got queue number of 625 out of 606 (out of supply  but this is not ""rejected"" or ""failed"" )  then u applied for Oct BTO  applicants with in-supply queue of 606 or less is not allowed to apply for Oct BTO. Somehow for unknown reason  HDB rejected your Oct BTO application or it simply stated that you not eligible. Maybe you asked HDB to check n thereafter HDB asked you to ""reapply"" Oct BTO (not ""rebook"") and you reapplied successfully.",btohqsg
You have two BTO applications currently right? Maybe you can share with us how your HDB dashboard looks like? How one can proceed/click correctly to view the status/ballot results/appts for each BTO application? So not to confuse the result/appt of one application with the other application,btohqsg
No  the June application my Q was 569/297. HDB later sent me invitation to select flat for the last 20 units   but they were all taken up. So the application in the dashboard shows Cancelled,btohqsg
Oh... But before HDB cancelled your June Bto application  could you see the two applications simultaneously?,btohqsg
You can see all your applications,btohqsg
Even the SBF application in Feb   it is still in my dashboadd,btohqsg
That's whereTeleshould correctly click to proceed to view result of his/her individual application right? I,btohqsg
Yes. Basically you click Proceed for that particular application to see,btohqsg
Every application you did will appear in your dashboard,btohqsg
