a lot of my friends did in my hall. and it was really a who want play then go play thing,btohqsg
it's super popular tho so not easy to get enough play time,btohqsg
you can always just book the court on your own time and play with friends,btohqsg
you'll make friends in uni too so,btohqsg
Personally I would say if you wanna try varsity badminton  you can try your own school's badminton team.If not  you can just try hall badminton. More towards the recreational side but yea  equally as ok.,btohqsg
Or if your sch has  you can try the inter school games if your uni has it,btohqsg
Wait this is abt uni badminton right?,btohqsg
"I deleted the msg about ""which uni you went to?""",btohqsg
"And then was like ""oh wait""",btohqsg
But i heard uni sports cca in hall can be intense,btohqsg
I think it depends on which hall you go to,btohqsg
If u choose the right course💀,btohqsg
Like there are the chill halls,btohqsg
Yea each hall apparently has different niche,btohqsg
Chill one need find RC / residence,btohqsg
But my favs are chill halls but still come for cca,btohqsg
I dun stay in hall but I joined a cca (not those part of residence one),btohqsg
But i assume he meant as in joining 2 ccas,btohqsg
Torturous. (Ok not rlly but the jc changed the schedule when new principal came in),btohqsg
Some of the student councillors in my school hv 2nd cca…i cant imagine,btohqsg
I was amugger toadin jc…but i didnt really care about that label my classmates gave me,btohqsg
Tbh i was mentally q strong in jc so idk what did uni do to me,btohqsg
I hope u can at least get along w a few people,btohqsg
Like u just need that few friends  then if the rest are idiots  dun really need to care,btohqsg
I think my classes in school were fine…,btohqsg
That is ok too  some people likes to be alone,btohqsg
I most fear of pe coz i think the only sports i can play is tennis and tchoukball,btohqsg
Speaking of badminton…i know y’all know my idol is who lah but i suck at it…i keep hitting the feather instead of the hard part (funnily the only stroke i can play is serve and smash🤣),btohqsg
As a strictly optional and a if I got time thing,btohqsg
Ya you dont wanna know how many ccas are chill but end up no one shows up,btohqsg
I mean.. I gotta do my assignments and I am a hall ghost,btohqsg
28 June: Panama 2-1 United States Of America Uruguay 5-0 Bolivia,btohqsg
Eh this username abit familiar ah,btohqsg
he's the guy boasting about jc and complaining about his psle points,btohqsg
I've said this once and imma say it again,btohqsg
By bros logic I'm a serial cheater 💀💀💀,btohqsg

Not all men ah like memes aside but,btohqsg

Calling those aged 16 to 25. You can do your part by donating blood to help the Singapore Red Cross increase the youth donor pool.https://str.sg/bTN3,btohqsg
depends on how far along is the woman into her pregnancy because some abortions if done later than a time frame period recommended it isn't safe for either fetus and even the mother,btohqsg
how to know if you are eligible to donate? i remember that there are some rules in order to donate blood de,btohqsg
if you dunno  dun worry they will do some health check before proceeding,btohqsg
a few days ago i had a matcha latte for $0.99,btohqsg
@aforaceI would donate if it was just plasma donation tbh they should offer those as well,btohqsg
but i dun think it is that feasible...how to just draw plasma,btohqsg
im more tired after a 1h nap:-(,btohqsg
wtf  nice ornot? worth the price?,btohqsg
I made my own in office/home before. Just have Matcha powder can liao,btohqsg
i tried this before but the one i bought not really nice...,btohqsg
To make things nice I found out a trick. Just add a fuck ton more sugar into it,btohqsg
Oh dam my sch perf at ndp rehearsal,btohqsg
Nah i just didnt get tixs,btohqsg
Oh i meant my schs concert band,btohqsg

Thank god i hv not showered,btohqsg
As someone who learnt a lil japanese  i cannot stand her kudasai accent in the first place💀💀,btohqsg
But surprisingly she has a lot of fans,btohqsg
Yes frfr  not stomach fluid but blood,btohqsg

Nothing like the taste of iron in ones mouth,btohqsg
Hey guys  I’m coming to singapore late july as international student. Do you think i should get and apartment and sign lease while overseas or should i wait until i get there?,btohqsg
hi guys  i just wanted to ask  if my gpa is terrible but i have a shit ton of achievements to back me up for the degree i wanna go for  will i still be able to in any way apply for uni,btohqsg
if you can secure accommodation before getting there  that'd be ideal bc it can be unpredictable otherwise. do your research on location and stuff tho,btohqsg
"""yes"" but your info isn't enough to say much more",btohqsg
I see your point and agree but at the same time i think it would be better if i see the room in person and sign the documents in person to avoid getting scammed,btohqsg
i’ll most likely end up with a low three! i have multiple certs  a year’s worth of work experience and have written a couple of papers in relation to the degree i plan on pursuing  will these be enough?,btohqsg
yea definitely. if you're able to secure it and only sign after seeing it in person  that'd be ideal of course. definitely speak to some agents/landlords about it first though,btohqsg
what degree are you trying to enter in ntu,btohqsg
Wtf im listening to Spotify on random,btohqsg
and suddenly it became all ndp songs,btohqsg
"The song was ""girls like you"" then after that ""one united people"" started playing",btohqsg
my spotify alr escaping from reality,btohqsg
My spotify fr escaping reality alr,btohqsg
My Spotify is on patriotic mode fr,btohqsg
PPGA can be competitive but the chance is def there. are all the certs  work experience related to the field as well? and ig just to be clear are the papers published in journals or smth?,btohqsg
Yeah its a normal song after the ndp song,btohqsg
All related. the papers aren’t published unfortunately  they’re more literature reviews than articles,btohqsg
ok  personally i think your odds are decent but not great since PPGA has a relatively small batch size,btohqsg
honestly  i’m not too particular on whether or not i could get in  i read up on the stuff i could get out of from taking up the course and it most definitely got me interested   i could probably look at other options  was just wondering how i’d fair in the application with the decent amount of stuff i’ve got on me,btohqsg
PPGA is hard to predict because it's small cohort  competitive and most people I feel would be applying based on a high GPA / RP,btohqsg
I have had enough of tiktok for the day,btohqsg
what did u last watch on tiktok..,btohqsg
Some guy in sg posted abt French ppl being rude in sg,btohqsg
Cause he was at a local restaurant,btohqsg
some family came in after the staff seated them and the fam ask the op for the chair they used to put bags,btohqsg
are these memes you make yourself,btohqsg
op said no because they were being rude,btohqsg
i think i heard of it before,btohqsg
then the whole comment is js the guy getting flamed by Westerners,btohqsg
saying its rude to put bags on chairs,btohqsg
the floors arent as clean as u think,btohqsg
and restaurants provide u chairs for the bag,btohqsg
they have their points reasonably explained,btohqsg
Btw this is like proper restaurant,btohqsg
like u need be seated by staff,btohqsg
and if not enough chairs at table the staff will bring,btohqsg
walao this one obviously sg guy has the advantage,btohqsg
since it is a zi char,btohqsg
90% of his comments are against him,btohqsg
I REMEMBER THIS SPECIFIC TIKTOK NOW,btohqsg
He never say zi char but its kinda implied from the way the restaurant worked,btohqsg
All ppl defending him are sg while all against are foreigners,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the comment section legit make me wanna drop braindead,btohqsg
If its an actual restaurant they will offer a basket for bags one,btohqsg
they all applying their european logic,btohqsg
If local rest its usually js chair,btohqsg
Legit all SEA country all offer chair,btohqsg
no matter how shit the place is,btohqsg
unless u rlly enter someplace damn rabak with no wait staff,btohqsg
But still claim to be restaurant,btohqsg
that one either lacking manpower or facilities lor,btohqsg
went to a thai coffee shop when in thailand multiple times,btohqsg
and all of the time the owner usually offer chair for bag,btohqsg
Anyways im gon go turn off my brain for rest of the day,btohqsg
im too tired for this bullshit,btohqsg
Lmao theres fraud protection insurance when paying for singtel bill  ironic,btohqsg
Workers' Party leaders Pritam Singh and Sylvia Lim retained their posts at the party's biennial conference  paving the way for them to lead the party into the next general election.There was a new addition to the party's central executive committee - former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian  who had stepped down in 2020.https://str.sg/JRqFL,btohqsg
Why watch 22 men kick 1 ball for 90 mins,btohqsg
and cuz i play football so can watch n learn :),btohqsg
If we just give them each 1 ball would be better what no need to fight for 90 mins,btohqsg
Let them kick till they happy,btohqsg
bruh I haven't done any work today,btohqsg
I ate but vomited it all out,btohqsg
Im in trouble coz1) i couldnt reach a bag in time so vomited on myself2) i reached home and felt nauseous again after attempting to wash the stain off my clothes…and vomited in the sink and im too scared to tell my parents3) i hv no way out coz my maid is still outside:-(,btohqsg
Because my mum jn alr scolded me for eating despite still feeling not completely alright and created trouble for my grandma’s helper,btohqsg
The thing is i feel giddy when looking at it:-(,btohqsg
Tbh been so long and i still hv not figured out the cause of my nausea episodes,btohqsg
It is like almost every time i get a headache  i will start vomiting 1h later,btohqsg
Sometimes this happens to me as well when I have a serious bad headache and my stomach is bloated from my dinner,btohqsg
After I vomitted out  usually will feel slightly better but still feel super awful,btohqsg
I personally have migraine episodes in case you are wondering,btohqsg
Actually that is same as me  recently like almost every week at least once,btohqsg
I don't have it that often tbh,btohqsg
Before that step  i need find cause first,btohqsg
isit right to be chanting amitufo at this late at night,btohqsg
Because only my relative (who is a few yrs older than me) understands me,btohqsg
The older people dun understand at all  either that or just cant be bothered to,btohqsg
Well I understand what you are going through,btohqsg
I really dun get it  like my mum clearly shows more concern towards my sibling’s wellbeing…i mean im the oldest child but not being there for me even when im just becoming weaker,btohqsg
Sadly speaking I think there are some people who think having headache = chao keng,btohqsg
This is why we need bedok in here,btohqsg
Then again my family has a history of bad headaches so we kind of understand what having headaches are like,btohqsg
Im the only one hving headaches in my fam:-(,btohqsg
Then again I think this is why I kind of like my colleagues here in my company bah,btohqsg
Because when I told them that I actually went to a headache clinic to check up on my migraines,btohqsg
They are all very empathetic to my situation,btohqsg
Idk am i throwing too high expectations on my parents or what…tbh i would hv gone to seek counselling help earlier if my mum was not brushing me telling her abt my issues away,btohqsg
I think normal bah to think of it that way,btohqsg
But more of like wishing your parents could actually understand your point of view,btohqsg
Like a time off sort of thing? There was once i suddenly felt giddy at work but idk if i shld sound out so i just try to last the day with it,btohqsg
They tell me don't work too hard,btohqsg
Take a break when you have to,btohqsg
I am actually a workaholic when it comes to work,btohqsg
Wah that is nice! There is a clinic near ur office?,btohqsg
The headache clinic is a place I found online,btohqsg
Because back then my girlfriend feels my frequent headache is abnormal,btohqsg
Like is it really called headache clinic?,btohqsg
So he pesters me to see a doctor for my headache,btohqsg
I searched online and there is a headache specialist in Tokyo,btohqsg
My friend actually did MRI but found nth,btohqsg
I see it and it turns out I have migraines,btohqsg
Oh there's nothing as well which is good,btohqsg
I know I have a water bed treatment to relax my muscles,btohqsg
Idk if it is me being dumb but my symptoms feels more like a migraine but then it is not really unilateral,btohqsg
Oh like if u hv chronic migraines  u can take meds regularly to sort of prevent it,btohqsg
Either way to answer your question  yes there is a clinic near my office,btohqsg
My office is like 49th floor  the clinic is 6th floor,btohqsg
For me  one of the main problems is the fact of lacking serotonin,btohqsg
Maybe i shld visit the doctor,btohqsg
wait but arent u in jpn?,btohqsg
I am quite surprised at the fee for my medical treatment,btohqsg
Im a farm graduate but these migraine medicine requires a doctor’s prescription:-(,btohqsg
I am prepared to pay like $1000 for my initial visit to the doctor,btohqsg
Like for consultation only or with treatment,btohqsg
Consultation + treatment + MRI + xray,btohqsg
Wait is that in yen or sgd?,btohqsg
Oh ok that is considered cheap,btohqsg
costs like at least $700 dollars here,btohqsg
Meanwhile when I have earblock during CNY this year,btohqsg
I went to a ear clinic for my earblock because wax accumulation,btohqsg
do u have like cotton buds,btohqsg
And that was like at least 10y ago so imagine the cost now,btohqsg
or u just cannot do it,btohqsg
I wanted to do it in Japan because I know its cheaper,btohqsg
But the earblock is really that bad such that I cannot wait,btohqsg
I saw the picture  the blockage is really that bad,btohqsg
I also can't hear very well,btohqsg
Er if it is impacted  best to not do it urself,btohqsg
I was like walao eh... My angpow money gone,btohqsg
so somerimes i ask my mum to do it for me,btohqsg
The doctor squeeze the pus out and my ear was full of blood,btohqsg
But the good thing is that I feel that my quality of life improves because of that,btohqsg
Oh I went to Google and search for a earwax removal clinic,btohqsg
I Google search in the morning,btohqsg
Then they tell me to go for appointment in the afternoon,btohqsg
Nah I dont want to go polyclinic because I am very scared of them referring me to some other clinics,btohqsg
In sg if u call as emergency  u go down probably need wait at least 30min,btohqsg
Because I am flying off to Japan two days later,btohqsg
I know very well that mine is not an emergency,btohqsg
Well in the end they really have an appointment,btohqsg
Apparently the doctor is very good,btohqsg
I see the place and it feels like some atas rich people will go if they want to see a doctor,btohqsg
Either way its an one off thing,btohqsg
In singapore they will anyhow assign if u dun pay private rate,btohqsg
So my dad keep telling me ‘moral of the story is need to work hard and earn money’,btohqsg
And thus this is why I go to a private clinic,btohqsg
Funnily enough I still remember how the healthcare system in SG works,btohqsg
And I know that yes I shouldn't go to a polyclinic,btohqsg
Even in a real emergency  u can spend 2h waiting at AnE,btohqsg
Tbh idk what is the real problem but Govt hosp seem to forever run out of bed,btohqsg
So another moral of the story is stay healthy yourself,btohqsg
Also get insurance before it is too late,btohqsg
If no insurance  even u rich i think also cant bear to spend so much on the hospital and treatment bills,btohqsg
That's why just be your own doctor,btohqsg
Yea and dun take for granted early years,btohqsg
Maybe planning to buy another one as well,btohqsg
Funnily enough this is what I do sometimes,btohqsg
If the illness is not that bad,btohqsg
I dun usually visit the doctor coz i stock up medicines at home,btohqsg
If very bad till the point that I need a specialist  then I will see a specialist,btohqsg
I just stockpile medications for most common ailments,btohqsg
Ngl this is what I do,btohqsg
Oni thing I need a doctor for really is antibiotics,btohqsg
Funnily enough my temperature always spikes when i visit the clinic,btohqsg
So I know what medicine is for what,btohqsg
There was once i visited the clinic coz i needed an MC…reached the clinic and i felt my body heating up,btohqsg
U can solve the problem by going jb,btohqsg
Nothing that some ibuprofen won't solve,btohqsg
Btw does eae projects have deadline?,btohqsg
The clinic gave me 2 panadol tablets,btohqsg
wah where u want to eae,btohqsg
I immune to those alr tbh also I find em weak,btohqsg
And wanted to send me to ttsh AnE and when my dad came  he scolded the nurse and say he wanted to speak to the doctor,btohqsg
Sadly speaking there's no concept of sick leave in Japan,btohqsg
He still working on arduino stuff,btohqsg
To my understanding is if u rlly sick u go hospital,btohqsg
He say can bring his projects with him for interview,btohqsg
Im immune to it for headache  but fever it still does help but some generic brands of paracetamol are useless,btohqsg
I kenna covid that time also have no paid leave,btohqsg
My boss asked me why I didn't take leave that time,btohqsg
Yea so u hv the answer to the qns  before the interview,btohqsg
I tell him I don't even have leave at that time to even take that,btohqsg
Oh so sick leave and normal leave is counted tgt?,btohqsg
In Japan  if you sick and want to rest at home  then its normal leave liao,btohqsg
The good thing is that my company can WFH,btohqsg
So if I suffer from headache that day  I just find time to rest,btohqsg
Reminds me of Poly sometimes ngl,btohqsg
Depends on how many years you are in the company,btohqsg
Especially RP some days u just can't be sick,btohqsg
Iirc average here is 14 MC 14 AL (initially) 90 hospitalization,btohqsg
While you might think Japan has not a lot of leave compared to SG,btohqsg
Japan has way more public holidays than SG,btohqsg
Is it true the work-life balance there is q bad,btohqsg
Anything can also become public holidays de in Japan,btohqsg
I always get that questions asked,btohqsg
I feel SG worse than Japan,btohqsg
I think mc and hospitalisation leave is more or less standard,btohqsg
Ig u can just offset using that for minor stuff,btohqsg
If you mean PTO by no pay leave,btohqsg
But I feel that Singapore's working culture a bit like Japan,btohqsg
I think I remember watching a video on SG working culture,btohqsg
Where people don't dare to leave the office if their heads don't leave the office,btohqsg
When I see this... I was like hmm that seems like a Japan work culture,btohqsg
And i heard my mum complaining abt this person who leaves on the dot everyday,btohqsg
If their heads dun leave until 10pm…gg.com,btohqsg
See the existence of your mum's thinking is an example of such behavior happening in Singapores work culture,btohqsg
But most will leave around 5-6pm anyways tbh,btohqsg
That one by 6pm u can slip out liao,btohqsg
Idk can just pull up with new projects it seems?,btohqsg
If I were back in SG,btohqsg
Some ppl just dun like bringing work home,btohqsg
Honestly I would just leave on the dot,btohqsg
U can. Also depends on office some is still a closed office concept,btohqsg
I mean no one is stopping u if u get work done,btohqsg
Not like the boss can actually see you,btohqsg
Some people just spend quite a lot of time taking breaks,btohqsg
But for me i probably would not stay too late coz if i eat my meals too late  i will feel nauseous,btohqsg
Also 12pm-2pm office is a ghost town,btohqsg
Actually hor why such thing happens because people scared that there will be someone complaining,btohqsg
Scared of backstabbing so they smokescreen it,btohqsg
No is just if u dun complete your work is one more thing to say they very uptight or smth,btohqsg
I mean ofc need to ensure work is completed…,btohqsg
Then that one is either the company's not very good in their management skills,btohqsg
Or skills issue on your side,btohqsg
Tbh sometimes that's why I hate open office concepts,btohqsg
I do hv some corporate skill issue im in the process of trying to fix it,btohqsg
That is why im q scared of entering the corporate world,btohqsg
Well I mean if you keep on OT just because you can't finish your work on time,btohqsg
Then its either you have a lot of workload which is actually a management issue,btohqsg
Usually is cuz u look too free..,btohqsg
Yea…it shows poor time management  but sometimes also due to workload,btohqsg
Or you probably have that habit which is something to look at,btohqsg
Oh my issue is on another matter but i hope i can get out of it,btohqsg
First thing is learn to protect yourself,btohqsg
Second thing is learn to read the air like what the Japanese calls it,btohqsg
Second is keep a record of everything,btohqsg
Thirdly is know who are the important people,btohqsg
That's a subset of the first,btohqsg
Not just important people  but colleagues in general,btohqsg
Know who is who so that when you need something in the office  they can help you,btohqsg
Usually it's a coworker from your department or smth of that sort.,btohqsg
Like for example  in my company there is this admin staff who probably is the go to person when people needs anything,btohqsg
So while I don't approach her a lot,btohqsg
There are a lot of cross functional teamwork required in the work place,btohqsg
I know that she is the go to person if I need to settle administration stuff,btohqsg
Funnily speaking I don't really approach my HR person a lot,btohqsg
Though I know who to go to,btohqsg
Lmao funnily enough that sounds more like my Uni than workplace ngl,btohqsg
Thing is. From my experience in Uni  sometimes they have Overlapping jurisdictions,btohqsg
Learn the importance of when to BCC vs CC,btohqsg
Luckily I don't really send emails in my workplace,btohqsg
But yes this one quite important,btohqsg
Funnily enough I got ppl say my emails too formal,btohqsg
I can take up to 30-60min crafting emails💀,btohqsg
yes you do take that long,btohqsg
I will need that diagnosis in August,btohqsg

Yeah i need to think of a chill one,btohqsg
I am taking condensed matter physics as my bde lmaoss,btohqsg
Need to use the p/f thing,btohqsg
For some reason i asked them and they said CMP is a BDE,btohqsg
P/F is for exchange and MOOC,btohqsg
bad for your sanity but good for getting more complete knowledge,btohqsg
Esp since i am taking ph3103,btohqsg
Ya if next sem is bad i will SU my bde,btohqsg
Gotta take a mod that gives u feedback before the SU option closes at sem end,btohqsg
Great time to su ph3102 LOL,btohqsg
anyway for the lectures  i'd suggest attending first few weeks then see if the recording can pass a not lmao,btohqsg
I wish we can SU that,btohqsg
too bad ph3101 cannot su hehe,btohqsg
Tbh SU is the most useless shit ever,btohqsg
I was told actually 7 aus can for su,btohqsg
Since when they do tht lmao,btohqsg
If like minor is 20 and then if it hits 21 right,btohqsg
Gotta check with the school.. depends on admin ah.,btohqsg
Then can use as 7 au,btohqsg
Some mods do.. like if got mid sem maybe they will get the results in by Week 10,btohqsg
i also need to remember to do course registration in a week,btohqsg
I was supposed to do Course Reg in June,btohqsg
it's a bunch of extra courses i gotta take,btohqsg
my graded physics mods done alr,btohqsg
Tbh PhD yall the Stars competitive meh?,btohqsg
How does the allocation work for mods?,btohqsg
the only annoying ones are those courses that every grad student has to take,btohqsg
like there's one that by right must take within first 2 years but i never manage to get a slot and idk if it's they never open enough or they give later year students priority first,btohqsg
so gonna try again this time,btohqsg
if still cmi i need email them alr,btohqsg
Ahh so it is admin preregistered,btohqsg
This just sounds like ICC with more steps,btohqsg
all the comm courses are pass/fail tho,btohqsg
the transferable skills programme are just one-time workshops and seminars,btohqsg
so it's really just TA course and the research comm one  which is the one i haven't cleared,btohqsg
Maybe I should follow Si Yan and get Permanent Head Damage as well,btohqsg
then other grad requirements: attend 5 seminars every sem lol  TAing enough hours  passing Qualifying exam and submitting thesis,btohqsg
oh yea apparently from the incoming batch onwards you need 1 paper publication to grad  which is like expected anyway,btohqsg
but surprised they made it a hard rule,btohqsg
Isn't there like a diff between PhD candidate and Student,btohqsg
Idk I heard from someone that it indicates their progress in the Qualifying criteria or smth,btohqsg
you are confirmed as a PhD candidate after passing qualifying exam that is about 1.5 years into the program,btohqsg
that's when i got a pay bump,btohqsg
in NTU there's like 2 phases ba,btohqsg
first 1.5 - 2 years  you do research but you also gotta clear grad mods  TA course etc,btohqsg
after that it's mainly research  publishing  conferences + TAing,btohqsg
uh I'm under scholarship so it's just straight per month,btohqsg
I remember once u hit the hours basically can dun give a shit liao,btohqsg
yea part of my scholarship terms but idm,btohqsg
yea that's why i'm taking 2 tutorial slots for the same mod lol,btohqsg
Usually by Y2 once u hit the hours basically is ORD lo,btohqsg
My 2nd qual exams soonMaking slides very pepega,btohqsg
twice the hours for basically same amount of work,btohqsg
Tbh do yall have to attend the lectures,btohqsg
It's just whenever I go to lectures the TA is almost always there,btohqsg
if the prof makes me i'm gonna be p sian lol,btohqsg

I read till cts functions then I just stopped LOL,btohqsg
Yeah I tryna do that for AI lmao,btohqsg
i just ignore math idk until i need it in my research,btohqsg
Or if you want to  you can try the computing minor,btohqsg
Computing dun have CoHASS mods in the basket,btohqsg
But it's damn new like so new I cannot even declare it as a minor,btohqsg
Mmm you can actually take the mods first then declare later,btohqsg
Declaring is not rlly the important part,btohqsg
Thing is.. I ran out of BDEs.,btohqsg
I claim MOOC to max liao and everything basically my last sem was 27 AUs,btohqsg
That's how I gonna grad in 3 years,btohqsg

I got bored in Winter Break last year.. so I just do 12 AUs in coursera,btohqsg
My admin say not possible... I say I am that one person in 10 thousand,btohqsg
Tbh also it ain't that hard. GEM has many loopholes and makes it damn easy to earn AUs in addition u could also take up a Minor in Entrepreneurship that is also offered in special term,btohqsg
Suah maybe i try neural networks idk LOL,btohqsg
do it-Si Yan 1 July 2024,btohqsg
How do you know what's inside you unless you test yourself? Don't do one push-up  do 100. Don't run one mile  run a marathon. Don't have one family  have a second family all the way across the country. Don't just have a second family  have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle. Don't spend any time with the first two families  make a commitment to family number three  and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party. Don't go to the funeral  'cause  remember  you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for. Don't just let Kenneth walk out of your life  take his life from him. Don't just go to jail  go to death row by killing the other two families. Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing  send a message that you're not afraid of hell. Nike.

... Holiday. I've given up all chance for a holiday. I've made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts. I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which there's only one conclusion  I'm damned for what I do. My anger  my ego  my unwillingness to yield  my eagerness to fight  they've set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet. What is my sacrifice? I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I'll never see. And the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or the light of gratitude. So what do I sacrifice? Everything!,btohqsg
