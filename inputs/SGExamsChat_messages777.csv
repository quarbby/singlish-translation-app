she just misinterpreted fluvial processes as fluvial flooding,btohqsg
so she wrote her whole essay abt flooding,btohqsg
when it was about the processes,btohqsg
Time to yap abt Kyoto protocol,btohqsg
Smth smth Canada withdraw in 2011,btohqsg
the RP consistent just the absolute grade change,btohqsg
Some details R damn unnecessary I feel,btohqsg
Eg UK outsource to china right,btohqsg
i rmbr my cher suan me,btohqsg
why ur chem drop from 90 to 79,btohqsg
then i was like bro i got P@,btohqsg
Is it just me for even for Os geog it's kinda easy to write out of pt,btohqsg
it's either u get it or u don't,btohqsg
My chem was a downward spiral,btohqsg
went from 90 to 79 to 74 to 71 to 70,btohqsg
U either get it or dont,btohqsg
THATS WHAT I HAD IN MINDDD,btohqsg
Literally all my subjects dropped except geog and gp,btohqsg
ur net amount of CO2 doesnt decrease,btohqsg
ur just shifting the power to who can produce to other countries,btohqsg
I dont consider it a very gd strategy,btohqsg
Smth smth EU reduce by 11.7%,btohqsg
I rmb my sec sch geog cherr,btohqsg
I would have done so much better for chem,btohqsg
in a levels i couldnt even name the stupid organic compounds,btohqsg
thats how bad my organic is,btohqsg
Pls la even those who signed can't follow,btohqsg
I think my a levels i unironically got 0 for all the organic qns except elucidation,btohqsg
USA producing 25% of global emissions be like,btohqsg
Why does this sound like multiple countries I think UN ones signed an agreement for the carbon emissions thing,btohqsg
but my year had very very little organic,btohqsg
like the whole P2 was physical chem,btohqsg
My egeog knowledge came in handy when I don't need it,btohqsg
yeah it was mostly in P3,btohqsg
Then now also got Paris agreement,btohqsg
But honestly I don't rmb jack abt this,btohqsg
I only rmb USA pull out,btohqsg
then the org qns they interlace with phys chem,btohqsg
it was when the concept of tipping point was like established,btohqsg
Ohya this is the idea that once the temp increase at some point it's actually Jo over for the earth,btohqsg
The 2 most significant conferenes that you should know,btohqsg
are rio 2002 and rio 1992,btohqsg
these are the 4 most important climate conferences,btohqsg
Sorry this is basically geog consult now,btohqsg
RIO 2002 was because it established the idea of a green economy and the shift from MDGs to SDGs,btohqsg
why sry it's giving me egeog nostalgic,btohqsg
From what to sustainable development goals,btohqsg
Aw fk I gotta revise LRAS SRAS,btohqsg
Then also got Thailand promoting gmo rice seeds or smth,btohqsg
Offsets or just cap and trade?,btohqsg
cause it was wen they agreed to meet the 2°C limit,btohqsg
The golden rice shit is a classic,btohqsg
I think I'll pass the test tmr,btohqsg
i hope they test smth funny,btohqsg
"""we can never protect  we can only adapt""",btohqsg
I'll send U the qn when I'm done,btohqsg
"""It is easier to adapt to climate change than to mitigate it."" Do you agree?",btohqsg
im very good at scaring people,btohqsg
Tldr mainly feasible for DCs right,btohqsg
Do a CCS. What is the point of the question,btohqsg
Just do History ppl. It's better than Geo is all I can say,btohqsg
Do H2 don't do H1. Economic History is a great addition if u alr doing econs,btohqsg
I feel like most ppl taking h2 hist take econs,btohqsg
Because economic history u kinda need econs,btohqsg
If not it makes no sense especially at things like AFC and Import Substitution,btohqsg
idk i dont take econs and they removed afc from syllabus alr,btohqsg
my fav part of h2 history,btohqsg
u just blame thailand for everything,btohqsg
ur chocie is either u do RE or AF,btohqsg
we learn about it but its not,btohqsg
then AFC is always the easier qn,btohqsg
cuz RE u need to know too much,btohqsg
Depends lmao u gotta answer it correctly u dun just blame Thailand,btohqsg
like its basically NU and PolStab part 2,btohqsg
im not a history student btw,btohqsg
this is just what I gather from people teaching me h2 history,btohqsg
We write that as the intro,btohqsg
taking h2 hist as a sci stream student feels  weird,btohqsg
(same situation  im the only geog student in my friend grp so everytime they study history they end up just teaching me),btohqsg
Like Thailand is the first domino basically,btohqsg
But I can write bs and actually score for that,btohqsg
reasons why i cant be a history student,btohqsg
i blame the thai for everything bad in the world,btohqsg
U write the word blame u insta ded,btohqsg
I would care if it was literature,btohqsg
He made it worse for malaysia,btohqsg
To give a fuck or not to give a fuck that's the question.,btohqsg
i dont know much abt AFC apart from thailand started it,btohqsg
In Economic History AFC is easy because it's a classic example of capital flight and the hot money inflows and outflows,btohqsg
But the issue is that most don't recognise the underlying issue that it exposed and fail to mention the fixed exchange rates,btohqsg
Short term usually put in there for interest,btohqsg
The classic phrase for hot money is there are 3 ways to stay in this business be first be smarter or to cheat. Now I don't cheat and although I think we do have some really smart people in this room it is a hell alot better to just be first.,btohqsg
At least u aren't required to concentrate in there.,btohqsg
so the number of days u get is the exact one,btohqsg
and now we cant have more than 3 mc days a month,btohqsg
What happens if u get a specialist,btohqsg
if its more than 3 day need to be approved,btohqsg
all the way back to camp,btohqsg
they check for 70% of the people,btohqsg
but thats if u come at like after 7.30am,btohqsg
like they mnaually open ur bag,btohqsg
They dont use the xray cuz the xray jam,btohqsg
i hope election is 3 months,btohqsg
Oh ya uk apparently GP chers have to go thru a power pt slide on gaza palenstine stuff,btohqsg
Opens up slide u see this.. mess... yeah... OK moving on.. Terrorism. Anyone heard of 911?,btohqsg
Tbh i hv some sensing it will be this yr,btohqsg
And likely a school holiday period,btohqsg
Coz they need to use the schools as polling centres,btohqsg
It is fun voting twice this yr,btohqsg
Most analysts think it will be sometime between September to December this year,btohqsg
Oh ya how do y'all censor a photo like y'all censor838473,btohqsg
wah@whatisgrassI just read the notes for the part i was asking for,btohqsg
fr confusing for the sake of being confusing,btohqsg
conceptually whats the difference between this and,btohqsg
my suspicion is correct u need to study these 2 parts in tandem for it to remotely make any sense because the way the syllabus document is structured treats Sustainable Development and Sustainable Urban Development as two completely mutually exclusive concepts,btohqsg
cant send later ej kill me,btohqsg
cuz they gave me the teachers copy,btohqsg
SUD is the city scale of SD,btohqsg
so to do what they did and treat them as two separate concepts,btohqsg
warranting two separate sets of notes,btohqsg
on the same idea of EF and CUM,btohqsg
No cause thats literally always been the case,btohqsg
SUD was always unpacked as a subset of SD,btohqsg
Which is why its fking confusing,btohqsg
why ur syllabus also doesnt have a portion that tests on SUD,btohqsg
Its just SD then it jumps STRAIGHT to SUD,btohqsg
Eh wait PE was last yr,btohqsg
Fml im still living in 2023,btohqsg
without an unpacking of SUD at all (stuff like Pacione's model  and what urban sustainability is),btohqsg
So some schs which dont even bother unpacking SUD and SD separately it just ends up confusing the students,btohqsg
Yall never learn dimensions of SUD meh,btohqsg
I just don't rmb the name,btohqsg
its the circle and square one,btohqsg
why i cant find the picture,btohqsg
its not in the syllabus document anymore,btohqsg
Like it is for H2 but its not for H1,btohqsg
But its kinda funny cuz i think all schs would still end up teaching this,btohqsg
cuz theres literally no way u can explain the further chapters on SUD without talking abt this,btohqsg
what happend to marking GP essays,btohqsg
EJ making me mentor one h1 geog student for free,btohqsg
I saw a diagram that's similar,btohqsg
3 gp essays and 2 aqs to mark,btohqsg
Lol man u sound kinda idk,btohqsg
I like how it's still unpaid,btohqsg
"Oh speaking of GP  here's the qn I chose to write for essay(WA2)""The ease of access to information creates more harm than benefits"". Discuss",btohqsg
My guess of what u did,btohqsg
u discussed harms and benefits separately without considering them together,btohqsg
what are the chances of me passing,btohqsg
Wait but I forgot what I wrote tho,btohqsg
It felt like you hit right on the nail,btohqsg
Anw I discussed 3 BP of neg and 1 positive AND I ran out of time so no evaluation,btohqsg
Oh wait this time it's not AQ mbad it's full essau,btohqsg
1. How reliable are statistics as a guide for planning the future?7. Given greater levels of international cooperation  how necessary is it for countries to engage in the arms trade?8. Should politicians pursue the popular viewpoint or their own convictions  if they conflict?11. ‘In a free society  there should be no restrictions on freedom of speech.’ Discuss.,btohqsg
none  i will choose arts and literature topic cus more familiar  rips,btohqsg
"actually how do you define a ""free country"" in this case?",btohqsg
4. ‘We shape our buildings  but then our buildings shape us.’ To what extent is this true of your society?10. ‘An appreciation of music is vital for a fully rounded education.’ How true is this of your society?11. ‘In a free society  there should be no restrictions on freedom of speech.’ Discuss.,btohqsg
"uk after I wrote diff shit separately   I went "" wait a min  smth doesn't sit right w me""",btohqsg
something dosen't feel right and change question,btohqsg
cuz idk i find the comparison very simple,btohqsg
i just marked one rly bad essay,btohqsg
i can confirm its not ur esasy,btohqsg

tell her just go to poly without sleep for one day 😞,btohqsg
I think her sleep schedule is gone alr if there is any  her boyfriend spammed her phone but can't get through and told us to spam her phone lol,btohqsg
Idk if she even has a sleep schedule cause lessons at 8 and sleeping at 4 is not very viable,btohqsg
she should not sleep for one day and sleep early the next day,btohqsg
Wakeupsingapore has actually been asking for it,btohqsg
