No need for words just give money to bless uss,btohqsg
guys how safe isit to lie on resume for internship? for past work experience. like i work 1 day b4 i quit but i say i work 5 days.,btohqsg
What if ur prospective employer is bff with ur past work place,btohqsg
Should I pursue passion or money?ðŸ˜”having alot of sleepless nights on the pros and cons...,btohqsg
but yea what are you looking at,btohqsg
unless your passion can alr make you money,btohqsg
I'm  in finance degree but parentz want to pay to get cs masters for me,btohqsg
like do you have your bachelors yet,btohqsg
i mean i like to teach ppl stuff and help them,btohqsg
what do you wanna do career wise,btohqsg
Cos rn doing consulting intern which is my passion,btohqsg
I feel I like it more than finance or cs,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the rationale of your parents wanting you to do a cs masters,btohqsg
like itâ€™s not like what youâ€™re doing now canâ€™t earn much,btohqsg
so iâ€™m trying to understand lol,btohqsg
OK only ah not MBB or Big4.,btohqsg
i think doctor and teacher pay decently well,btohqsg
But my consulting more of analyst type,btohqsg
but the amount of effort you have to put in is not proportional to the amount of pay you receive,btohqsg
They want me get Fch at a lower rank oversea uni for masters cos my local undergrad only 2nd upper,btohqsg
Then they say paiseh cos my cousin all fch or zai uni,btohqsg
They ask me prep all the coding languages a year+ in advance,btohqsg
if letâ€™s say you went and didnâ€™t get fch then what,btohqsg
They also say how come I 88.75rp cannot get fch,btohqsg
Say I never work hard enough etc,btohqsg
Go hang out with friends too much,btohqsg
Keep saying last time they Do Engi no Internet or tuition even still get fch,btohqsg
Now got so much help also cannot etc,btohqsg
And how stem>finance etc finance so easy also not fch..hear every week liaoðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Wah rly feel like just converting to ft consulting and heck care them,btohqsg
I respond last time condo amd hdb how much only....then they got mad lol,btohqsg
Last time how many % uni grad also,btohqsg
it is your future...not your parents' future,btohqsg
like fr why not just do your own thing at this point,btohqsg
even if letâ€™s say your parents were right  you make your choices and be prepared for whatever outcome,btohqsg
my parents also tried to kinda dissuade me from pursuing eee but i dont really care haha,btohqsg
if you listen to them and hate it youâ€™re gonna kick yourself for not doing your own thing,btohqsg
Cos they threaten not to give me inheritance or see me again etc or not meet me if I don't listen,btohqsg
but of course pursue smth that u can make a comfortable living la. no need to be very high income,btohqsg
there was a time where i was deciding between civil and eee and went for eee instead partly cause the prospects for eee are better,btohqsg
maybe iâ€™m jaded la but this kind of threat will snowball if you listen to them bc of it,btohqsg
like whatâ€™s stopping them from always using this lol,btohqsg
5 days might as well don't put,btohqsg
nah i work 1 day oni lmao,btohqsg
don't plan to put my work experience,btohqsg
yeah 1 or 5 also don't put in no point,btohqsg
resume is tough early on lol,btohqsg
i think less than a month no point tho,btohqsg
is it a part time job resume or full time,btohqsg
if part time resume u can smoke,btohqsg
