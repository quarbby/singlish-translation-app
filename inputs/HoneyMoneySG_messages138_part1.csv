Hi all  seeking your advise. I have click on 3 times the links for Singsaver when apply for Citibank CC due to unable to click proceed button. it trigger 3 emails from singsaver to fill up the reward. Which one should I click for the email? Tq,btohqsg
why need to change statement date? Rebate is based on calendar month and there is tracker on Maybank treats app.,btohqsg
So everyone the card holder alsosame.date?,btohqsg
Easy to monitor the expanse for every month,btohqsg
use the tracker on treats app to monitor?,btohqsg
Rebate i think is also following by the statement month,btohqsg
not true. it is by calendar month,btohqsg
O. Meaning is if the statement date is 20th  the rebate also counting from 1st to 31th every month?,btohqsg
Then if the minimum spend if base on the statement date or celender month.,btohqsg
No following by the statement date?,btohqsg
If the statement date is from 20th to 19th  should between the date spend more then $800  right?,btohqsg
Maybank fnf dont work like this  each bank tnc is different,btohqsg
So meaning is if my statement date is 20th  but the minimum spending should count form 1th to 31th   right?,btohqsg
Posted transaction from 1st to 31th,btohqsg
What do you mean with whales? No max cap?,btohqsg
Quick check - HSBC revolution gets 4 mpd when used on Shopee  right?,btohqsg
I think Anthony was joking at 3:29am today haha.The cap is still at $1k for 10x rewards points but it is no longer that easy to earn just by using contactless.There are far easier cards to get 4mpd and the ‚Äúwhale‚Äù must have maxed out all those and have to use the HSBC Revolution.According to him OCBC Premier Voyage best üòÇüòÇ (Also joking),btohqsg
Hi folks  anyone know where to use hpb Kopitiam e-vouchers? I‚Äôve tried to use it at few Kopitiam outlets at Sengkang but all stalls rejected because they do not have the scanner to redeem the e-voucher.,btohqsg

Did you try Compass One Kopitiam?,btohqsg
Not yet. But I tried Rivervale Plaza and Anchorvale Village Kopitiam outlet! Get rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

Hi all  I signed up for the HSBC travelone card a couple months ago. I‚Äôve fulfilled the the spending requirement alr.Do I have to make payment for the annual fees within 2 months too? And if so  how do I do it. I do not have a HSBC account and I can‚Äôt seem to find anything on the HSBC app to pay for annual fees,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know whether the min spend of S$600 on DBS yuu card to qualify for the additional 26 yuu points refers to transaction date or posted date? I found the t&c here to be conflicting,btohqsg
I see  so still okay to get some last minute vouchers if I can‚Äôt hit the 600. Thanks!,btohqsg
What is the disadvantage if synthetic?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt cspx cheaper from your calculation?,btohqsg
Like if they have the scanner to scan Fairprice app they should be using the same scanner.,btohqsg
I first thought so but they said can‚Äôt do that.,btohqsg
Probably need to complain so they get educated? Tried other stalls? Or every stall said the same thing?,btohqsg
USD is 1.7 + gst = $1.86  is the fee the same if I buy more like $10k?,btohqsg
Tried all stalls at 2 Kopitiam outlets still rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è perhaps only selected Kopitiam outlets can accept but no ideas which outlets! Check with Hpb and FairPrice seems they have no ideas too.,btohqsg
You should have just redeemed ntuc vouchers  easier to use,btohqsg
"Suay. I also encountered similar things with HPB credits. Some stalls put ""accepts HPB credits""  but they removed their business PayNow QR with their personal PayNow QR  so ended up unusable.",btohqsg
Yeah üëç I thought Kopitiam easy to use too but now regretted,btohqsg
"Noticed annual fee got charged to my DBS WWMC but still in 'unbilled' status. Can I only request a fee waiver after it gets moved to ""current"" status? I tried requesting but got rejected for some reason even though it's my first year.",btohqsg
Hi gurus  I currently own the UOB one ac and UOB one card  my spending for the past two month were $500.If I were to apply the UOB lady card and spend abt $600 using it  & $500 using UOB one card this month  does it mean that I will not enjoy the bonus interest of 3.33% as my total spending for this mth is more than $1000.This does not meet the quarterly spending tier of $500 right?Thanks.,btohqsg
Yes you can. If system rejects  call in and speak to a CSO. If you have been using the card or have a relationship with DBS or POSB  you will not have any issues with AF waiver.,btohqsg
You will qualify if you spend at least $500 on UOB One. You will not get into a higher tier since it will need a quarter spending of $1 000 posted each statement month to qualify for that tier.,btohqsg
If i statement date is 20th  so the 1st dollar in minimum spend $800 is posted transactions in 21th or 1th?,btohqsg
