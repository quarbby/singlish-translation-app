I like doing things by myself,btohqsg
Its okay to do things alone,btohqsg
i mean u wanna spend time with people to talk or sth haha,btohqsg
Well i do want to spend time with my friends but sometimes you need time for yourself,btohqsg
And I dont really have a lot of friends so I'm comfortable with doing things alone,btohqsg
I guess its our own personal choices and preferences. Not everyone likes doing things alone like myself,btohqsg
If it makes you feel better going out with friends why not? :),btohqsg
I know but it's just that i spend a lot of my time with my grandparents alone like almost every single day and it's a bit hard to convo with them when they dont really wanna talk,btohqsg
Im sure you have some friends who like cats :)),btohqsg
and ya i do have friends it's just that i dont see them that often,btohqsg
Its okay. Im kinda jealous you get to spend time with your grandparents. I didn't have the chance at all as they passed away before I was born,btohqsg

and the physio has told grandpa to walk as much as possible to improve his strength and stability so he can independently go back to work,btohqsg
so aunt told me to get him to get his newspapers and letters independently but with me near so i can help to catch him if he falls,btohqsg
nope he still wants to sleep all day,btohqsg
I guess he probably has this mindset that since he's old he shld not waste so much of his energy,btohqsg
But its actually the opposite. Young or old we still need to do some form of physical activity,btohqsg
