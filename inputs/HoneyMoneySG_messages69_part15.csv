Hi guys  anyone familiar with how ocbc 360 account interacts with repayment of ocbc credit card expenditure? Looks like the expense got deducted off my account balance and messed with my ADB. Is there a way to change the setting such that the expense do not tamper with the ocbc bank balance and we get to repay it after X days like other credit cards?,btohqsg
i don't use instagram  üòêcan I still win a ticket? would love to give it to my husband who just recently moved to SG. This would be a great start for him to learn about endowus and start investing  using SG roboadvisor.,btohqsg
Is this cash voucher also for existing users?,btohqsg
To qualify for the current Moneybull promo  must both USD and SGD be active?,btohqsg
For bank  most of them provide personal loan.If you need to conveniently withdraw cash  DBS/OCBC has the most ATM machines.  For high interest  each bank has their own rates and t&c so do your own research.if you just need the bank account to just hold money and do Wire transfer  most banks in Singapore can do that.You can apply for miles card that is from different bank than your savings account. You can watch honey money videos to decide on the miles card for your needs  or milelion website to research on miles card (https://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/),btohqsg
Hi Bro. Citi bank / SCB bank / HSBC bank CC are goodBalance transfer is good option,btohqsg
SCB card design looks nicer for me,btohqsg
The HSBC mobile app is horrible!,btohqsg
Where got loan so low one? 5 yrs somemore.,btohqsg
Most likely fake. Just anyhow one.,btohqsg
Mayb borrow from friend 3% eir hahaha,btohqsg
3% interests  even my Mum would not lend me,btohqsg
Hey guys  would like to do a quick check whether anyone knows which banks' ATM inJB city squaredoes not impose fees on cash withdrawal usingTrust Bank Card? Thanks alot! :),btohqsg
Will say see your investment records and strategy. No right and wrong. Just need to ensure if let say u entirely wrong in direction of market. Then any contingency plan to repay the loan.,btohqsg
If get sack during this 5 yrs period....,btohqsg
Of course if u have assets well above many times. Then borrow 75k is not big deal.,btohqsg
Not a financial advice. But shld have no issue. If u plan worst case scenerio etc.  I also sometimes have margin in my trading account.,btohqsg
Personally don't encourage leverage. Unless u are already seasoned investor/traderthan maybe OK.,btohqsg
EIR is everything  not the marketed rate. Not even 5 - 6% profit can be guaranteed over just 5 years in the stock market.,btohqsg
if the interest from loan is lower than t bills or for example uob one first 100k deposit ingerest yield   there will be an infinite money glitch,btohqsg
quite sure 3% is not EIR,btohqsg
Might even be negative return if market down,btohqsg
5.5% actually lower rate than what IBKR  moomoo  Tiger margin is offering,btohqsg
not sure if u can repay back early,btohqsg
if u can outperform 5.5%  i guess it's not bad? but u able to find anything that can outperform?,btohqsg
The key is not just outperforming 5.5% p.a. for 2-3 months..It is being able to outperform 5.5% p.a. CONSISTENTLY for the next 5 years,btohqsg
1 thing that comes to mind is the promo chris shared  but that's only 2.5 months,btohqsg
only 5.4% not including forex risk,btohqsg
"There is a risk that the Money market fund (either SGD or USD  depending on what currency you put in for the promotion) drops in value right?And from what I search online  you cant seem to check the ""price"" of this Money market fund that easily to track historical performance.",btohqsg
nothing else comes to mind for now,btohqsg
Soon Moomoo etc will come up with a better promo to beat Webull üòÇ,btohqsg
Just trying to look at it from another point of view. Am not trying to make this promo look bad.,btohqsg
Can consider- USD MMF (5.4% with forex risk)- US t bills (forex risk)- chiong all the broker sign up rewards,btohqsg
So he can move from one promo to another,btohqsg
May i ask why is the USD MMF guaranteed?,btohqsg
Experts here can advise how to hedge the Forex risk,btohqsg
not guaranteed  but the rates are stable now,btohqsg
No such thing for retail investor. The hedging cost more than the interest.,btohqsg
how much of that 75k u can afford to lose first?,btohqsg
dang  i shd ask u for advice instead,btohqsg
Example if u have networth like maybe 5x. The loan amount. Then not issue.It is not financial advise. I talking to myself,btohqsg
AK every night talking to himself ü§£,btohqsg
AK post YouTube every night  talking to himself,btohqsg
Don't know what u talking about. Suddenly jump subject,btohqsg
Do your own research. No one will give this type of advice.,btohqsg
