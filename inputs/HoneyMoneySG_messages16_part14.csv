Yes  they are quite smart the MCC are different from bars/restaurant some can be quite grey. The bars and restaurants are of different category. So we have to choose wisely,btohqsg
can use other 4mpd uob cards (e.g. mobile contactless using uob ppv) for these grey ones,btohqsg
Will I get 4mpd using hsbc revolution via kris+? Thanks,btohqsg
