Haha your question hard to ans leh depends short mid or long term.If short wait for retracement back to the range support buy n wait then sell at range resistance play safe üëçIf long wait for 200ma come down gradually turning up then go inIf long also can buy now eventually it will go back to pre covid lvl at least 1 to 2 yrs (uncertain if another black swan event happens gg),btohqsg

Sri Trang Agro results is out. If before it was undervalued  now is dirt cheap. The net profit jump 214% and if not for ocean freight jam  the results would be even stunning. Further there are net realisable value on inventory amounting to almost 33% of net profit which couldn‚Äôt be reflected in this financial statement otherwise the earnings would be even higher. Sri Trang Agro is really the King of Rubber Gloves of Thailand. Spectacular results. Hands down.,btohqsg
which is why monday the MT boss better do a good show and help Mt price up,btohqsg
if MT cannot even up sri trang how good also same fate,btohqsg
somemore sri teang managed to largely escape the slide,btohqsg
and even UG which dropped lesser recovered more than MT,btohqsg

despite increased testing and serious case count increasing,btohqsg
the tests are 3 days late and is a fraction of true infection cases,btohqsg

JB  what is your take on MT  will still go up higher?,btohqsg
What do you think of Cement?,btohqsg
I think Medtecs fundamental is still good  being heavily sold-down now RSI is 26.53 (Oversold region on Daily chart)  price is currently trading below MA20  MA50 & MA100.. 100MA is currently at $0.625Can also buy and keep should go back to at minimally $1.40-$1.50 range by next year 1st quarter..You go and see my last time Medtecs chart on Medtecs support groupWait ah later I share my technical chart here~,btohqsg
Medtecs Daily EW ChartW1 Start 0.020W1 End 1.97W2 Currently at 0.760W3 if 161.8% of W1 = 3.93W4 target down 38.2% of W3 = 2.72,btohqsg
What price level negates this wave,btohqsg
I like your chart.But sometimes certain news such as vaccine news derail the climb. Out of our control.....which is unfortunate,btohqsg
For this Medtecs Elliott Wave  for Wave 3 to be confirmed price has to break above $1.98Rules of Elliott Wave is Wave 2 cannot go below Wave 1.Because this is a Mega Wave so very hard to say the Wave 2 will retrace to what level BUT EW rules > Wave 2 retrace minimum 20% of W1  Wave 2 is typically 50%  61.8% and sometimes even 76.4% or 85.4% of Wave 1.So we can use the Fibonacci levels and Moving Averages as a guide currently Wave 2 already went below 61.8% of W1 (0.770) and after hitting 0.760 it rebounded back and closed at 0.885So most likely it should test the next Fib level at 1.00 and if it's supported well  next Fib level will be at 1.23If W2 retrace 76.4% of W1 = 0.485 (I think this is very unlikely to happen as 200MA is 0.620 (Yellow line),btohqsg
Yes  chart is dead unless we update it..It will be affected by news and earnings report etc  so need to update themHowever 5min & 15min charts are more sensitive to change compared to 30min & 1hr chart..And daily chart are even more insensitive..All this are used as a guide  ultimately you need to understand and make sure the Fundamentals of the company is good  at least you know looking ahead it's gonna go up,btohqsg
So as long price don‚Äôt go back 2 cent means still valid,btohqsg
Just sharing the Technical Side of the Share price..üôèüèª,btohqsg
You can check with Master Yuan also  as he is an Expert in EW,btohqsg
So between 2 cent and 1.98 is just noise. Go 2 cent negate wave.Break 1.98 then start wave 3,btohqsg
For those who interested in Elliott Waves.. (How to calculate estimated minimum/maximum time taken for each wave)Most likely range in time for Wave 3 is between 1 and 4 times the time taken by Wave 1.Although there is no minimum time constraint for Wave 3  its absolute maximum time limit is 7 times Wave 1.Although Wave 4 has no minimum time constraint  the maximum time for Wave 4 is twice the time taken by Wave 3.,btohqsg
Lol ok. Pretty noisy thoughBut between your mega waves anything smaller for reference.Since is like an all-in type. Either see u at the peak $3.90 or pig $0.02Cut loss also no pointBy its balance sheet no way to see 2 cent but nothing saying cannot range between 2 cent to $1.98 for next 2 decades right...Must have mega long life to ride the wave,btohqsg
Got time projection involved? Possible to incorporate fibo time projection at least expiry by price or by time.,btohqsg
I know shit about this so just thinking aloud,btohqsg
If you assume MT Mega Purple Wave 2 ended at 0.760 (near W2 down 61.8% of Purple W1)Then using the Wave 2 down typically 50% of W1 EW guidelines  and W3 up typically 161.8% of W1  and W4 down 38.2% of W3  and W5 up 100%/123.6% of W1 guidelinesYour projected mini Pink Elliott Wave will look something like this,btohqsg
Within your Pink Wave 1  there will be another smaller 5 Wave EW..Red EW projection,btohqsg
Thx for effort. Dunno how to see and appreciate.Surely a lot will be hoping u are rightI not so sure. To go such a price I also dunno how many more people gonna die.Of course I don‚Äôt mean shareholders are devils. Just saying out loud to go such price means must be damn catastrophicSleep Liao so depressing.,btohqsg
For those interested  can use this Rules and Guidelines for Elliott Waves üôèüèª,btohqsg
By Jan we should know if the projection is true or the downtrend continues,btohqsg
