Taiji everywhere whose fault become air fault. 😂,btohqsg
No more grab or tada available I think,btohqsg
It’s cheaper and there will be someone picking up as usual,btohqsg
Never kena that’s why dare to take,btohqsg
I also get this 60cents cpf return wtf. Jan earned 4xxx. I before 1995 so mandatory to opt in. Emailed them but no replies wtf.,btohqsg
How to opt in or opt out ? Don't see an option for that,btohqsg
Wow hw u guys earn 4k plus a month with such shitty llm order earnings,btohqsg
Esp with those nonsense pooling orders,btohqsg
maybe they higher tier vehicles or full time llm lor,btohqsg
No la. Jan CNY a lot good price. So I just whacked everyday. Sedan not van or lorry,btohqsg
Bro we born before 1995 means we old men already   for us not mandatory   so how come they pandai pandai opt in for us ..that is the question   if my phv friend say is true he say he and some friends also kena mostly age 40 above  auto opt in .. siow,btohqsg

Haha... Mati liao.. they make LLM like grab car...🤣🤦,btohqsg
Go down to Lalamove office when you’re on the way.Demand them to trace this monkey.Tell them to be accountable to other drivers or will escalate this to the relevant authorities (LTA)!!!,btohqsg
Lta will just fine the driver 😂,btohqsg
What you expect? Caning & jail sentence?A fine & a record will deter that monkey to commit again.,btohqsg

By Monday night your wallet should not be a negative Bro.,btohqsg
Myself. So now if I cash out all for the week  the following week I won't take cash order as a start. It's always the cash order that can make ur wallet negative without u realising,btohqsg
Yeah cash order all got platform fee,btohqsg
Funny they charge user platform fee but driver pay,btohqsg
LLM take driver comm to pay to customer making their delivery platform more attractive,btohqsg
Wtf how come gst also must deduct from driver,btohqsg
Wa the LLM really no joke raining the price never change haha,btohqsg
Aiya nothing new for this LLM. All issues also outdated one.. just dont do.. so many platform outside with better payout. Have a gd night everyone.,btohqsg
Not doing at all I just want to check if there is different haha,btohqsg
Seriously??? Pooling and driver swipe kinda quick too,btohqsg
Saw this too hahaha maybe driver stay in jurong ?🤣🤣,btohqsg
Understand the home destination part. But it just gives off the wrong ideas to consumers. Now these a-holes will spread the word….,btohqsg
Can start to look out for next week onwards for better rates coz people starting to order in to break-fast.,btohqsg
In SG started liao  Lala-ride. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Even so  it’s illegal. As good as SGHitch. Kena stop by TP or LTA  car can be impounded.,btohqsg
Raining period ppl like to take pooling arh. 🤣,btohqsg
Esp to CBD cos CBD got extra surcharge,btohqsg
Be careful of this order. Suspect ah long case,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA! Not so much. With the amount of drivers on the road  where got enough? 😅,btohqsg
Break fast nvr have extra better rates jobs one lah,btohqsg
Then they will understand what we went through,btohqsg
