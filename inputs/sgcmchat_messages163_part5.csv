much much more road feel as opposed to the previous ones,btohqsg
builds up quite well on the Dirt 2.0 foundations  more pronounced under and oversteer,btohqsg
drawback is that it isn't that well optimised yet. with a 3090 it still has abit of lag at max graphics.,btohqsg
also the controls are a pain to bind,btohqsg
actually ngl the 4.0 looks like a monster truck compared to the Cup,btohqsg
is that an RSR or Cup,btohqsg
i think the RSR cup got yellow headlights,btohqsg
