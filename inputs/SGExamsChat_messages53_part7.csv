I'm a Samsung fanboy  but it disappointed me a lot recently,btohqsg
And the camera and wireless charging and upgraded connection speeds,btohqsg
For $649 some more  I just get without question (and I hate apple btw),btohqsg
I'm waiting for Note 20 to see if it's good  then trade in,btohqsg
Cuz it might use SD 865+,btohqsg
but apple all 12 mega pixel tho,btohqsg
Note 10 like $1.3k on Samsung website,btohqsg
Their camera is actually reliable unlike S20,btohqsg
I heard s20 pro got focus issues,btohqsg
All the S20 variants got autofocus and heating issues,btohqsg
How much do you get paid per month?,btohqsg
You know they say  if you can't buy it twice  you can't afford it,btohqsg
You could always go for the NS internship  ez $630 per month,btohqsg
Don't buy Note if you don't have at least $2k  cuz you'll need the remainder as fallback money,btohqsg
my internship company pushed back by 2.5 weeks  then they up the pay from 800 to 1k to compensate  but since i'm staying until dec i actually gain more $$ kek,btohqsg
nah i saving for grad trip,btohqsg
ahh yeah i don't know what's the arrangement for mine also  sigh but since i'm staying for such a long time maybe it'll blow over and i can get a proper internship lol,btohqsg
Erm why no one mentioned oneplus 8,btohqsg
Cheaper than samsung  comparable in quality,btohqsg
I think he said itâ€™s the best android phone up till now,btohqsg
Then u need wait for note 11 or something ba,btohqsg
Which is likely going to be 1.5k,btohqsg
Plus a lot of sociology  philosophy,btohqsg
