Knew him since Secondary school  used to be straight A students.Chosen Mech. Engineering wasn't the best choice for him I guess.Electrical/Electronics Engineering in Uni mostly just substitute numbers into equations or programming with logic.,btohqsg
so I believe this is the reason I faired well compared to him lol,btohqsg
also in my university  literally 90% of the EEE students from my batch a first class honours recipients. üòÇ,btohqsg
"the only Singapore entertainment  I believe last time I remember is some longwindy drama singing ""Wa Meng Ti"" something2.Otherwise is Jack Neo's films.",btohqsg
im also confused with that regards,btohqsg
Honestly  for a supposedly First World country  it really feels ‰∏çÂ∫îËØ• to be outperformed on cultural exports by almost all of our supposedly poorer neighbours,btohqsg
We are still in the decade,btohqsg
but honestly the conversation these last two hours has been a little confusing because of how many mini subtopics are being dicussed,btohqsg
it's only a matter of perspective..,btohqsg
But not all first world countries are culturally rich as well?If first world countries are taken to be DEVELOPED countries (im guessing this is what u mean and anyways singapore isn't even considered a developed country nor really a first world country by some standards)Most third world countries have far more cultural vibrancy,btohqsg
^ refer back to this reply@gunslinger_nick,btohqsg
and also consider how much support sg citizens and even permanent residents in sg can also claim in subsidies from the gov if they meet the target criteria,btohqsg
I counted 40+ active submarines with live locations still available out of the 85 showed lol,btohqsg
weren't we on discussing on the number of active US aircraft carriers...?,btohqsg
since when are submarines considered aircraft carriers,btohqsg
Idk I just referenced it from the pic of all the shops you replied to  I mean aircraft carriers wise the Us still dominates like mad crazily. China is nowhere close,btohqsg
i never mentioned that the site you referred to for cross-checking isn't totally inaccurate  might have been a little incoherently on my ends as well but you need to double check where you're sourcing information from,btohqsg
But it's the fact less than 10-20 people worldwide know where the submarine attack fleets are at  at any one time if we talking about us naval supremacy,btohqsg
While all the aircraft carrier fleets are tracked  the submarines are not,btohqsg
while  yes i agree US aircraft carriers still dominate the global army ranking in terms of combatants capability but their main force is the destructive aspects...,btohqsg
why the hell do you keep repeating about submarines when it's about aircraft carriers,btohqsg
I mean you also have to see which aircraft carriers tho  not all 12 are good and in working order,btohqsg
that's why i mentioned the word ACTIVE,btohqsg
There are broken active aircraft carriers as well üòî,btohqsg
i never mentioned how capable or function-able it still is as of present day,btohqsg
i really want to ask you to politely kay-why-ass,btohqsg
We're also in an easy win region. We could have easily solidified the lead over our neighbours by doing what China's doing right now and just making MASSIVE investments in media that ËÆ≤Â•ΩÔºàÊñ∞Âä†Âù°ÔºâÊïÖ‰∫ã,btohqsg
A C T I V E  includes those aircraft carriers that have yet to be;i. scrappedii. out-of-service ??? decommissioningiii. yet to be completed or put to serviceiv. conceptual projects on tentative schedule,btohqsg
you're talking about a hypothetical scenario which you know will NEVER exist,btohqsg
because of how mother tongue has faded into almost an all-time low obscurity,btohqsg
likewise with collective language dialects these days,btohqsg
Actually what is the point you getting at ah  I Abit confuse lol,btohqsg
singapore dramas stop after the 1990s,btohqsg
refer to the pie chart graphs i showed you,btohqsg
I can see that but what you trying to tell me?,btohqsg
look at the percentage of destructive destroyers* that how the top 3 global-wide countries (are) known for their navy forces,btohqsg
im sleepy* but my jello is decaying in the air,btohqsg
Ye and what about the percentages?,btohqsg
ya kah? then besides Jack Neo's films I don't think Singapore has much cultural films.,btohqsg
and his films also low budget üòÇ,btohqsg
Wasn't there like 4 local films that won the acclaimed french Cannes festival,btohqsg
Considered good for SEA  but only because our neighbours are even WORSE at movies than us,btohqsg
compare the percentage of china & russia's destroyers ( china's percentage of destroyers 11.5% + an estimation of  russia's 15% percentage of destroyers  total sum is still a bit behind US' percentage of destroyers at a staggering high of motherfucking 28.8%  bro,btohqsg
Singapore broadcast korean  chinese  hong kong dramas on weekdays. taiwanese and thai dramas on weekends,btohqsg
why tf are you even comparing,btohqsg
do you not realize that our cultural roots and entertainment culture is not even BROAD or very big of a stage for those celebs?,btohqsg
Singapore writers wrote bad plots better to ask AI to write,btohqsg
4/5 local singers that made out of singapore also all going to be age 50 and above,btohqsg
there's like almost zero to none paparazzi's in Singapore as compared to larger countries with much BIGGER entertainment industry circles from music  art  filmography  cinematography  gaming  espots  acting  idols and the most of many more creative arts goes onin places like south korea and china  its a hellhole for these celebs,btohqsg
yeah but i hate that even abysmal hellhole,btohqsg
