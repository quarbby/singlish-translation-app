2JZ fast in straight line speeds,btohqsg
retarded for most circuit racing unless u want ur car to be heavier than it needs to w power output,btohqsg
because it isn‚Äôt a piece of shit,btohqsg
Just because it uses bmw parts doesn‚Äôt mean it sucks bruh,btohqsg

hi guys  anyone knows if the meet at giant tamp is still on?,btohqsg
What time people start going home,btohqsg
sian all the hiace come make so much noise,btohqsg
wait till you can afford a car before saying it sucks,btohqsg
the A80 is fucked in itself,btohqsg
"not a proper ""sports car"" in comparison to the R32 and all",btohqsg
that's why it's a fucking boat,btohqsg
the A90 is *the* best Supra,btohqsg
and yet gt car variants dont even use the damn 2jz,btohqsg
the B58 has the most aftermarket support out there for practically any modern car,btohqsg
having been in a few stock and modded B58s,btohqsg
isn't the GR86 just another Subaru then?,btohqsg
considering the power output they make too on a stock block,btohqsg
"or the ""best car ever made"" McLaren F1 just another BMW?",btohqsg
and yet they perfected the fact its for balance and drivability,btohqsg
the tunability on stock internals is beyond what other manufacturers can offer,btohqsg
it doesn't blow up when you turn,btohqsg
DOMINIC TORETTO IS THE MAN OF THE SMART PEOPLE,btohqsg
a friend of mine has an A80 in malaysia,btohqsg
sold it  bought an A91 after his first test drive,btohqsg
A80  hardtop  2JZGTE Manual might i add,btohqsg
*the* most desirable option  had period correct TRD and HKS parts,btohqsg
iinw chassis code for A91 is for manual ones,btohqsg
A91 is only for promotional what,btohqsg
must rmb  he owned the A80 since 2006  said he would never sell even if offered blank cheque,btohqsg
but the A90 was such a huge step and alot better to drive than his A80 Supra,btohqsg
in case you're 13 and you can't read or googlehttps://topgear.com.sg/supra-trooper-a80-owner-talks-about-the-a90-toyota-supra,btohqsg
"""Times were different in the 90s and you can‚Äôt build a new car today that only appeals to an audience still'bogged down‚Äô by the 90s.You need a modern car that is worthy of being the current flagship sportscar of Toyota‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs exactly what the A90 is today.""",btohqsg
You guys know he said he was 13 right?,btohqsg
why tf u gaming on a laptop,btohqsg
no such thing as harsh in the sgcm chat,btohqsg
at 13 i had a brain capable of understanding the A80 is a shit box,btohqsg
cannot wank off to bald men driving cars,btohqsg
i only wank to you driving mercedes,btohqsg
i liked the A80 because it was a GT cruiser LOL,btohqsg
i liked it because of fast and furious,btohqsg
but the eclipse looks better LOL,btohqsg
they chose targa simply because they needed someone to hang off the car,btohqsg
else it could've been a different car all together,btohqsg
Anyways what is a affordable car to drive in sg if ur a student,btohqsg
Looking to drive to sch after I get my license,btohqsg
I using my daddy's money ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
How much do they go for,btohqsg
just dont buy a car at this age,btohqsg
sg car mart is a thing bro,btohqsg
insurance just put under dad's name,btohqsg
Or shld I just use getgo to get arnd,btohqsg
might as well stable job buy a better car then,btohqsg
brother u old enough to use getgo then u sort out ur financials first,btohqsg
getgo 25 and up for p plate,btohqsg
u can always go for tribecar bro,btohqsg
later u kena charged 2000 for nothing,btohqsg
u sort out financials and buy a good car later on,btohqsg
u buy a car now using ur money u are basically not allowing urself to buy a better car in the future imo,btohqsg
is common sense to singaporeans who are financially literate,btohqsg
u worry about ur downpayment first,btohqsg
u finish school first then think about car,btohqsg
i know people buy car in school end up buy vios and scirocco only,btohqsg
That's why I said I'm using daddy's money,btohqsg
end up car in workshop  no money all. do telehitch cannot cover petrol,btohqsg
daddy‚Äôs money then go all the way la bro,btohqsg
u care more about downpayment first,btohqsg
cfm easily more than 30k if u get a decent car,btohqsg
shut the fuck up la shane,btohqsg
Not a fan of the bumper,btohqsg
u buy car first then talk about other ppl car later,btohqsg
fk u i know u 17-20,btohqsg
lai pm i want tell u smtg,btohqsg
Like every question I ask is like starting a war,btohqsg
if you want to wrap yourself around a tree,btohqsg
but ideally as a p plater,btohqsg
if you don't want to rent,btohqsg
is the way i talk bro,btohqsg
u think what i loan money splash paint ah,btohqsg
if u diedie want a car now  yes vios is the answer,btohqsg
How to be racist if I also chinese,btohqsg
I thought chinese is osps one,btohqsg
indian say malay but work as chinese,btohqsg
bro i am actually marina bay sands bro,btohqsg
i thought you malay and not chinese?,btohqsg
according to malay people like@a_junni not malay enough,btohqsg
cos u dun put something like this indeed2,btohqsg
im not racist if i'm racist to everyone,btohqsg
isn't that what people want nowadays,btohqsg
i actually believe in being the top 1%,btohqsg
jem was technically the top 1% of bald pedos when he went to prison,btohqsg
but he might has well have been,btohqsg
if you want to watch a proper racing show,btohqsg
cos they have a specific goal out of it,btohqsg
Michael Fassbender has done a docu with Porsche and Le Mans,btohqsg
but tbf idu how they measure it,btohqsg
tbf the only reason i watched was because i drove Hakone,btohqsg
u either get grip or power,btohqsg
so it balances out q well,btohqsg
but maybe IRL application not so?,btohqsg
my bro there were WINGS ON A COROLLA IN INITIAL D,btohqsg
RE71RS on a NA MX5 vs 992RS on Michelin Primacy,btohqsg
irl application idt there is even a way to measure grip well enough to have a balanced enough,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs not based on tyre compound or threading,btohqsg
ppl put sg flags on their mirror,btohqsg
it was a challenge based  on initial d‚Äôs plot,btohqsg
so if u didnt watch initial d it doesnt make much,btohqsg
i dont rmb i think smtg along those lines,btohqsg
so nsx also was at big disadvantage,btohqsg
the fastest car is the cayman non-gt4 and the A110,btohqsg
if u watch initial d ull freak out,btohqsg
Can't wait for a season 2,btohqsg
i wannn goooo but i at churchhhh üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
so sad gonna miss this meet,btohqsg
Caught this awhile back in Paris but idk what isit,btohqsg

didnt have to show his dick üò≠,btohqsg

I GO RECENT ACTIONS TO SEE,btohqsg

what are your thoughts on people who race for a living,btohqsg
as long as they‚Äôre not chinese he‚Äôs okay,btohqsg
yeah youre acting like a victim,btohqsg
and you‚Äôre accusing and blaming me for bullying,btohqsg
you can hide behind your screen and accuse me all you want but at the end of the day you‚Äôll know that you‚Äôre gaining nothing from it,btohqsg
yeah that‚Äôs what your  people always do,btohqsg
all of my chinese classmates always make bs up,btohqsg
its beginning to look alot like christmas‚Ä¶,btohqsg
is no one gonna talk bout this,btohqsg
Wow! Where did U see it?,btohqsg
this is sexsince its not trademarked imma steal this,btohqsg
eh jn u at fullerton ah@k4ges,btohqsg

oh wow is the cafe nice,btohqsg
130 Beach Rd  #01-11 Gucco Midtown  Singapore 189774,btohqsg
Porsche cafe is not bad  smth like a starbucks but porsche sprinkled,btohqsg
i wanna see that gt4rs on display,btohqsg
+ cars to fuck ard in LOL,btohqsg
isok bro thx for location tho,btohqsg
you can drink the orange juice or water or coffee ah,btohqsg
tapi the food all idt halal,btohqsg
sorry to let yall down guys  no more trolling from me and no more ahbeng matrep moments,btohqsg
is that a RX7? sorry am new to cars.,btohqsg
isn't the FD1 the one that Roysinke Takasheeshee one?,btohqsg
ok guys as my first step as admin,btohqsg
i want to ask a VERY important question,btohqsg
Ah shit I voted the wrong thing üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
dont worry everyone has their own taste,btohqsg
but not everyone can do doughy,btohqsg
doughy with that perfect sour fish curry,btohqsg
it‚Äôs almost as perfect as a how good the Zonda could‚Äôve been,btohqsg
i feel like raisuke tashika is better,btohqsg
the let down being the handling,btohqsg
or a lack of skill from the driver's part,btohqsg
i trust hamiltons word on it being hard to handle,btohqsg
the moment he touch the throttle in the tunnel,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why lewis sold it anyways,btohqsg
he said it in an interview if im rigjt,btohqsg
but tbf he has 2 AMG Ones coming,btohqsg
so maybe need to make space,btohqsg
he said it doesnt handle that well,btohqsg
not cos he crashed it like twiceüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
so he sold it off for a mclarry or smtg,btohqsg
but i cldve sworn i saw somewhere he said he doesnt like how it handles,btohqsg
he owned it until very recently,btohqsg
i just did a quick search,btohqsg
the codalunga is a well handling car despite its length,btohqsg
was talking to a friend of mine who reviewed it on TopGear Singapore's blog,btohqsg
the fear factor is the cost of the car  that aside it handles amazingly,btohqsg
the huarya is a really good car for it‚Äôs form factor,btohqsg
the car is a decade old,btohqsg
what do u do for a living,btohqsg
and yet it looks like it was born yesterday,btohqsg
these cars have aged very well,btohqsg
one car that i think honestly aged q bad,btohqsg
i think by the time the gt86 came out the design cues looked really similar,btohqsg
and it‚Äôs starting not to look as new now,btohqsg
i think it's slightly showing its age,btohqsg
ignoring the fact that it sold like shit,btohqsg
it‚Äôs that one hot aunty some families have,btohqsg
i blame yamaha for not selling it in VR46 colours,btohqsg
sorry i was thinking slightly old and good looking,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNorruob/hi guys whoever support gets 1 cent paynow frm me while stock lasts,btohqsg
there will for sure age well,btohqsg
compare the early 2010 e classes,btohqsg
the screen and buttons aged like shit,btohqsg
though the car has aged well,btohqsg
sorry mercedes electronics always age badly at this rate because of how fast we get improvements every year,btohqsg
the pre facelift W212 E63 looks very modern still,btohqsg
bugatti going with more buttons was a good note too,btohqsg
if the best or nothing why my friends mercedes air intake break in half,btohqsg
not air intake i forgot what it‚Äôs called,btohqsg
he got the latter part of the slogan,btohqsg
i cant even report you anymore,btohqsg
an slk might be on the list of cars i might buy but unlikely,btohqsg
