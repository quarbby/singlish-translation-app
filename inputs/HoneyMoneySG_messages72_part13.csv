1  u have $0 end balance in uob one on 30 Sep?2. What are the months of your uob one card qualifying quarter?,btohqsg
What is the best card to get most miles for fuel expense?,btohqsg
UOb Visa signature has a cap of $2000 only for overseas  spend per mth  correct ? Any card with bigger cap ? Say can absorb $10k overseas spend?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan help to clarify this with HSBC? If past participants invited before 25 Oct 2023 aren't eligible  suggest to update your YouTube video 3 weeks ago to notify your community so they won't mistakenly put money in this EGA when there is no hope of getting any bonus interest.,btohqsg
nope for 4mpd cards. if the MCC is right you can pair uobkf with amaze for uncapped 3mpd and lower FCY  else maybank horizon visa uncapped 2.8mpd,btohqsg
1) Yes  $0 end balance on uob one on 30 sep2) every month will spend $500 on uob one credit card,btohqsg
1. The promo didn't exist before 25 Oct. Which means after 25 oct then you may register and be successful2. The hsbc video 3 weeks ago didn't talk about this since it didn't exist yet,btohqsg
ok. note that uob one card goes by statement one while uob one account go by calendar month,btohqsg
personally i have multiple principle card under my family so i just spilt the amount under different card but if u have only one card it depend on merchant if they can deduct 2k on one and the rest on another card to maximise the miles benefit,btohqsg
I asked HSBC and they said I’m eligible,btohqsg
I have changed uob one credit card to go by calendar month. So if confirm the $100k in uob one acc can get 5% interest + the $550 Christmas promo  then the effective interest will be 6+% for the 3 months. Not sure if can double dib. Sounds too good to be true. Anyone got experience and can comment?,btohqsg
of cos true lah  if not nobody will do the earmark,btohqsg
Hi there  for Instarem  I am trying to download the statement/ transaction history. It is not appearing in the web version. Does anyone know how to get the statement in a PDF format? Thanks.,btohqsg

Anytime before tax season is good. Tax only filed once a year  but if you considering the interest in MA also  then do it ASAP.,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC is good for 10x for hospital payment?,btohqsg
still good for private hospital with mcc 8062  4mpd for max $1k monthly  although now have 1% Amaze chargeif public hospital can pay on healthhub  use dbs wwmc  citi rewards card directly instead,btohqsg
Does the 1% Amaze charge show up on the 3DS OTP screen? Or applied after the amount shown on that screen,btohqsg
separately additional charge after the transaction  reflected on instarem app,btohqsg
I see  so no prior warning before 1% charge at all. Thanks,btohqsg
SGH is not 8062? If the patient is not local  can still use healthub?,btohqsg
sgh is mcc 8062  but if can pay through health hub can save the 1% fee.,btohqsg
All these freebies subject to annual fee payment ?,btohqsg
The patient is family members  but not residents  so don’t think can pay with HealthHub,btohqsg
Then just pay with base citicard for 1.2mpd or uob absolute for 1.7 cashback,btohqsg
I think still okay to pay with Crmc + amaze with 1% fee for max 1k to get 10x,btohqsg
Quick question! UOB Lady's good for travel but does it also cover local hotels? Doesn't  right?If so what is good for local hotels.. between uob ladys & crmc + amaze,btohqsg

its based on daily average balance   if day 1 you have 1$ and day 30 u have 10000$ . it will take (10000$ + 1$ x 29days) * 3.85% * 30/365 days,btohqsg
