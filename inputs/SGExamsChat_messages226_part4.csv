Hello! Can I ask whatâ€™s the benefit of joining a CCA in polytechnic? Iâ€™m aware that itâ€™s optional. But if someone decided not to join any CCA  will it affect uni admission/ GPA etc?,btohqsg
No impact on your academics  but if you end up having to apply to uni through ABA or applying for scholarships  lack of a CCA is not exactly an attractive thing,btohqsg
Unless you have something else behind the scenes also,btohqsg
Like you secretly run ten volunteer organisations,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s for the tangible effects  I mean,btohqsg
Joining a CCA will let you have more fun in poly also and learn cool things,btohqsg
If u join exco itâ€™s a good chance to learn leadership stuff,btohqsg
Itâ€™s potentially enriching to you as a person  provided you pick a CCA suitable for you,btohqsg
