Why is his identity not out sia. He high profile?,btohqsg
they scared victims take to vigilante justice,btohqsg
So much conspiracy theory for what,btohqsg
Just let it come as it comes,btohqsg
He is not the main cause but oh well,btohqsg
Wah the auntie one is sad sia,btohqsg
he already ownself pwn ownself. he admit speeding up to prevent saab from overtaking,btohqsg
That's why I say not main cause,btohqsg
Cos defensive driving wise it wouldn't have happened,btohqsg
Ya. not main cause but indirectly causes the accident,btohqsg
he admit tailgating the saab also. and blame the motorcyclist for hogging the road,btohqsg
Yeah but I not sure he gonna be held accountable for anything,btohqsg
i hope tt motorcyclist is a makcik.. then can stir racial sentiments. ü§£,btohqsg
Come out tonight play  one day have to return one,btohqsg
he wont be held accountable la. only hated by SJWs,btohqsg
More likely hated by all regular law abiding drivers who don't drive like assholes who own the road.. üòÇü§£üòè,btohqsg
mebbe.. and tt saab driver would probably walk free... üòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Yea esp now I still trying to get my license,btohqsg
"im stilling waiting for his ""medical condition""  or brain tumor or brake faulty or accelerator jammed or kkj itchy",btohqsg
Thought the Saab is the one that ran the red light?,btohqsg
"he is ah.  even get charged also wont get death penalty. 8 year max mebbe? + license kantong  then appeal for lesser sentence due to ""depression"" or health condition etc  + holidays.. mebbe less than 5 years come out.. still can continue to langgar ppl.. nice right.. sg law",btohqsg
Driving langa won't death penalty la. Unless he has intent of murder,btohqsg
Sounds like eventually a lot of pple wishing that driver also kena langgar in china or states.,btohqsg
u watch tv or movies? bad guys dont die early or easily oneü§£,btohqsg
really self pwn. wanna come out act innocent  end up ppl posting all discriminating videos/testimony on himü§£,btohqsg
ya.. i think merc go jit that saab one. but saab suay.. Ê≤â‰∏ç‰ΩèÊ∞î,btohqsg
What I don‚Äôt get it is why he need to speed up,btohqsg
Coz he langga the white merc?,btohqsg
So he sped up to avoid?,btohqsg
Something we girls will never understand,btohqsg
Somewhere else I hear is the Merc speed up den Saab ego drive faster to overtake den cannot control,btohqsg
Theory already say  overtaking other car increase speed den don't overtake,btohqsg
The auntie is in a van,btohqsg
17yr old was in another car,btohqsg
The flowers are still there at the traffic light,btohqsg
Those that died not in the troublesome cars,btohqsg
Still under investigation so no point to jump to accusations,btohqsg
It's best to let the victims' families mourn in peace,btohqsg
Which is rubbish  cos if U know a vehicle is overtaking U should slow down (CFM not speed up) to let it overtake,btohqsg
Diabetic also eat lor. Better to die happy than hungry,btohqsg
Merc said he sped up to tell the Saab driver to slow down. Then Saab bua tio merc when avoiding the bike when he tried to overtake merc,btohqsg
People dun let u overtakeJust dun overtakeWhy need to ngeh ngeh,btohqsg
We all can like dis say but what is going on in those ppl minds,btohqsg
I thot by now someone should have found out the Saab driver,btohqsg
None of the vids manage to capture the license plate meh?,btohqsg
Probably u go read Reddit or what la,btohqsg
I don't support vigilante justice of course,btohqsg
Well if there is info by now should have trickled to my side,btohqsg
Reporting the licence plate is fine,btohqsg
My thoughts isSaab not discontinued liao meh??,btohqsg
