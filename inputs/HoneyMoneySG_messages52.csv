Hi can ask for UOB one  for the $500 spending on credit card  I understand if I spend $400 on insurance premium (not eligible for Cashback). But if I spend more than 600 on the credit card  will the $200 be eligible for cashback? Thanks,btohqsg
anyone purposely make giro payment fail so that the money will be deducted only on the next try? objective is to keep the money in your bank longer.,btohqsg
Perhaps you need to provide more details on your question.1a). Is it your spending is $600 qualified transaction excluded insurance + $400 insurance(non qualified)?Or1b). $400 insurance(non qualified) + $200 qualified transactions?,btohqsg
1b only has $200 qualified transactions n it is less than $500 to qualify for credit card cashback.,btohqsg
So even though I spend more than 500,btohqsg
To get UOB one credit card cashback  you need to spend $500 or more on qualified transactions each month for 3 months.,btohqsg
But I will still able to qualify for the 3.85% bank interest rate right,btohqsg
if men can apply uob lady card is there a need for hsbc revo anymore,btohqsg
Provided you meet all the requirements. Salary or Giro  + $500 spend requirements.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs good replacement for EGA? My promo ended  for july,btohqsg
I considering this and park 100k to maximise.if you create new stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
"then not worth to ""lock in"" the incremental funds.",btohqsg
I happen to have a newly created Stash so I think just nice can double dip.,btohqsg
Or best fd rates for July,btohqsg
Or the rates only come in on Monday?,btohqsg
Any other way to apply for Citi prestige without having to put 10000 monthly income on the application page? Eg. secured credit version etc,btohqsg
Provided if the day end balance on 30 Jun is zero. Right?,btohqsg
UOB lady only cover 2 categories which definitely something will be missed and hsbc revo can be the back up (somemore 4mpd + 1% cash back isnt that bad afterall),btohqsg
already have citi rewards w amaze so am thinking between hsbc revo or uob lady as the backup,btohqsg
to maximise 0 or a low amount will be the best  since anything beyond $100000 don't get much interest.,btohqsg
no harm keeping revo as no annual fee,btohqsg
but if you worried about orphan point  perhaps need to considered again then,btohqsg
I did pay my bill 2days late  which incurred a $100 late charge and subsequently waived. Dont seem like this interest is something on top of the late charge tho,btohqsg
you can try to call in and appeal! i almost didn‚Äôt make it last month  the customer service officer told me can try to appeal,btohqsg
actually  the current hsbc rate is 3.85% right? + 1% extra if u meet the criteria? pardon me if i got it wrong. i just opened an account üòÖ,btohqsg
What is the rate after promo is over?,btohqsg
I haven't check the current rate. this month is my zero balance reset month. üòë,btohqsg
did u send the sms last month ? this month so far no EGA BI promo,btohqsg
Is this the 1% giro  cc  and save  or the 4.x% saving?,btohqsg
My cycle is May to Aug for 4.30%,btohqsg
basic interest for EGA is 0.05%,btohqsg
EGA BI is the 4% one  everyday+ is the 1% one,btohqsg
So which one is stop? Or both?,btohqsg
EGA BI no more  everyday+ still on website,btohqsg
Okay  my cycle is may-Aug  assume it will be Aug as my last month,btohqsg
Axs is excluded from almost all credit card for reward. You cant use credit card to pay cc bill also on axs,btohqsg
That is the interest incur for 2 day late payment. Late charge is late charge  interest is interest. Call to appeal,btohqsg
Interest from Late Payment usually only reflected after your cycle cut off date. Can call in for waiver,btohqsg

Should work as long as not blacklisted by Citi Rewards,btohqsg
There are some effort needed for CC world.,btohqsg
Understand ur lifestyle  and find the credit card that suits ur lifestyle and expenses...,btohqsg
I am just asking how to pay at hawker centre. Can I just use XNAP  or  need to apply for other credit cards?,btohqsg
For online transactions or mobile countless I can use UOB EVOL. How about hawker Center SGQR code? Which method is enough?,btohqsg
Is the uob online banking down? I key in otp so many times and it says its invalid,btohqsg
I can download google pay. My question is if I use google pay to scan the SGQR code  can I get the 1.7% rebate from UOB Absolute because google pay bind to UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
I have been using XNAP with UOB Evol for Hawker,btohqsg
Press the blue button ‚ÄòOTP‚Äô and key in,btohqsg
I just applied UOB Absolute. Want to know worth or not or need to change other credit card  like AMEX?,btohqsg
I did...it says invalid..i generate a new otp and key again..again it says invalid.. my mobile app has this same issue today also,btohqsg
Do most hawker have XNAP QR?,btohqsg
I want to choose one  but not keep so many. I applied for UOB Absolute is because can get rebate from school/gov/hospital fees.,btohqsg
UOB Prvi Card have a 50 000 miles sign up bonus if you spend 1k per month for 2 months consecutive. Anyone tried using cardup to qualify for this?,btohqsg
From my personal experience I would say roughly half. Those with the SGQR will usually include XNAP or Liquidpay (former version of XNAP),btohqsg
Seems that I got the answer. I use XNAP first at hawker centre  if cannot use I then use google pay  but not sure google pay can get rebate or not. My google pay will bind UOB Absolute.,btohqsg
Google pay can use as PayNow. But PayNow doesn‚Äôt give rebate. However google pay can bind credit card.,btohqsg
You need to use paylah if you plan to pay to paynow on gpay for UOB cards.,btohqsg
PayLah and PayNow are different. Why need to use gpay? What rebate can get from PayLah? Not convenient for me to topup PayLah. PayLah only allow DBS to topup  no other method  like credit cards.,btohqsg
regarding the topup thingy  you can auto debit and set wallet balance limit to be $0.So effectively its directly debiting from/crediting to ur linked bank account.Don't have to deal with wallet balance,btohqsg
Possible to earn any rewards for paying private driving instructor lesson fee via paynow?,btohqsg
I usually don‚Äôt put money in DBS. PayLah can only link to DBS.,btohqsg
scan QR for google pay cannot be funded by credit card  can only be funded by linked DBS paylah (ocbc and scb also listed but may be buggy),btohqsg
Google pay can add credit card. And can add PayNow (any bank  not necessarily DBS  OCBC  SCB),btohqsg
iPhone can also download google pay. Use scan QR only  not for mobile contactless.,btohqsg
can add but cannot use lah,btohqsg
Credit card may not workable. But PayNow should be ok since google pay can catch my phone number.,btohqsg
Then how to scan paynow QR to get rebate?,btohqsg
scan paynow QR using google pay is funded by dbs paylah,btohqsg
paynow u added in googlepay is for receiving fund,btohqsg
If receiving fund can go to PayNow  spending fund cannot go out from PayNow?,btohqsg
DBS  OCBC  SBC are more convenient to send fund to people. Now we are talking about to scan PayNow QR at hawker centre.,btohqsg
I will try to pay a UEN by google pay. Don‚Äôt know it is an online transaction or PayNow transaction.,btohqsg
uh  paynow is has always been receiving account  bank/paylah etc. is funding account,btohqsg
What you mean by cycle?? If I top up on  10 July  I will earn 4%+++ interest on the top up for how long ?,btohqsg
I will try first. If really cannot I then use PayLah (I have to put in DBS some $).,btohqsg
I opened DBS is to withdraw USD from moomoo.,btohqsg
he sent sms to register for bonus interest in May  get bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in May to Aug as compared to Apr,btohqsg
If I send on may 30 ? I wil only get on 1st June to end of August?,btohqsg
If belong to online transaction  UOB absolute may give me some reward to pay some commercial invoice by keying in UEN.,btohqsg
cannot use credit card for this,btohqsg
technically 1 May to 31 August  but of cos only get the interest if there is incremental average daily balance in the account,btohqsg
Transfer from UOB via FAST transfer  will be top-up to paylah  ready to use with gpay.,btohqsg
btw cannot add uob absolute in any mobile wallet,btohqsg
If using DBS WWMC  ill still incur some form of FCY to earn the miles right?Cos the hotel is charging in their local currency,btohqsg
I have OCBC. So no need PayLah anymore. Thanks,btohqsg
Can add UOB absolute to google pay for online payment,btohqsg
This quarter cat didnt choose travel,btohqsg
ok  but what use case for uob absolute on googlepay online?,btohqsg
So  If I Sign-up and top up on any of the following days from 1 May to 31 August  I will receive the interest on the amount I top up from 1 May to 31 August only ?If Yes  then why not 1 May to 31 December?,btohqsg
How to know my UOB EVOL spend exceeds $600 or not? I can only see all eligible card spend exceed $500 or not.,btohqsg
Need to manually calculate by myself? Then too tedious.,btohqsg
What is the cutoff date of UOB EVOL for counting the $600 spend? Last day of the month? If not  how to change?,btohqsg
Can I use UOB Mighty FX debit card to withdraw cash like normal ATM card? If yes  then I don‚Äôt need other UOB debit card anymore  isn‚Äôt it?,btohqsg
Must I add DBS/OCBC/SCB to google pay in order to use paynow from google pay? Can I add my UOB Mighty FX debit card instead? Debit card is equivalent to bank account  isn‚Äôt it?,btohqsg
Here says if paying for goods/services by scanning QR  no need to connect bank account. Only when sending money to someone (not for goods/services)  need to add bank account.,btohqsg
More debit cards may incur annual fees if forgetting to use in future.,btohqsg
I'll do it ELI5 style.1. Send money/pay via QR/phone number/UEN -supportedbank account (DBS PayLah!/OCBC/SCB)2. Receive money via QR/phone number - linked PayNow3. Contactless/in-app goods and services purchase (currently ONLY movie tickets) -supportedcredit/debit card (most VISA/Master cards  AMEX cards issued by AMEX)4. PayLah! can be topped up using a non-DBS bank account via FAST transfer,btohqsg
If calculating cashback is too tedious for you  use unlimited cashback with no minimum spending cards. Pay and redeem the cashback. Don't have to think so much.,btohqsg
This morning I bought Âç§Èù¢  pork  and fish. All can use XNAP. So the target of $600 spend will be easier to achieve.,btohqsg
Tried google pay PayNow. Must connect to a bank.,btohqsg
Because I also want the higher interest by UOB One Account.,btohqsg
Then just spend a bit more than $600.,btohqsg
As per my previous ELI5 message  send money/payment via QR/phone number/UEN only via supported bank account. Linked PayNow is for receiving money only.,btohqsg
I have a US chase bank and would like to transfer it's balance (USD) to Singapore bank account or brokers. What would be the cheapest way to do so? Thank you,btohqsg
If convert to SGD  can try IBKR,btohqsg
If u are planning to keep it in usd  cimb has free incoming remittance,btohqsg
Is there a minimum balance required by CIMB?,btohqsg
Thanks. Would Chase USA charge a fee if I deposit USD into ibkr ?,btohqsg
Point 3  none. But u need $1k to open account,btohqsg
Ach transfer no fee from ibkr,btohqsg
Thanks kel. But the major fee comes from that chase USA would charge $USD40 for international transfer this is what I want to avoid,btohqsg
In that case definitely use ibkr,btohqsg
Free incoming transfer  then u can convert and withdraw sgd if u want,btohqsg
It might be better for me to use it to withdraw USD fromcapital.com. Wire transfer is their only withdraw method  and no TT incoming fund charge.,btohqsg
"But chase might still charge a fee ""to"" the ibkr?",btohqsg
Can I use CIMB to withdraw USD from IBKR without TT charge?,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks. Let me try next week.,btohqsg
I wire from JP Morgan chase USD account to DBS multiplier USD account. Chase side charge me USD25 upfront (deduct from amt transferred). Upon receipt in DBS  they charge me another 0.05%,btohqsg
Anyone knows HSBC EGA minimum balance and fall below fees like ?,btohqsg
If no charge to withdraw USD from IBKR to CIMB SG  I can open a CIMB bank account.,btohqsg
I also want to know any method to withdraw USD from IBKR without TT charge,btohqsg
It only store sgd for cimb.,btohqsg
IBKR SG uses DBS to receive fund  but use Citibank to pay fund,btohqsg
CIMB cannot store USD? Then no need to open CIMB. I open it is to transfer USD.,btohqsg
Yes. Unless u are preferred customer. Aum few hundred k that kind,btohqsg
Ibkr to sg banks no fee,btohqsg
If anyone is using Shopback  please don‚Äôt. They just robbed me of my cash back,btohqsg
SGD no fee. USD is considered remittance  there is TT charge. If I convert to SGD  later need USD need to convert again  normally will have some conversion loss.,btohqsg
I am abt to start using shopback pay. Wat happened?,btohqsg
I just received an email saying that my cash back expired,btohqsg
How did they rob  you ?,btohqsg
Apparently it‚Äôs not. Now all my cash back gone because it ‚Äúexpired‚Äù. Is this actionable? Can I sue them?,btohqsg
You can reach to them by clicking the link provided,btohqsg
Suggest you email them first and appeal. Going thru legal for a small sum does not seem a sensible move yet,btohqsg
Shopback has more rebate than XNAP? If bind UOB EVOL  can get 8% rebate.,btohqsg
Unless your UOB EVOL reaches $600  then might need to use other payment methods.,btohqsg
But I am lazy to calculate whether reached $600 or not. I am blur blur.,btohqsg
The extra rebate comes from shopback and not your card. Means it will not offset your bill. To keep it simple just treat both as a method to convert the spending to online spending,btohqsg
Use the UOB app to track overall spending at least. If you want to ensure you get both the rewards from online and contactless then you need to find a way to keep track yourself. We all find some way here.If you are not familiar/confident with spending on UOB Evol suggest you change to no min spending cards to keep it simple for yourself,btohqsg
Can uob lady card points convert to cashback ? If yes what‚Äôs the rate,btohqsg
I will try to reach $600 spend per month. I applied UOB Absolute (no min spending) to pay school/Govt/hospital expenses,btohqsg
I just downloaded shopback app and linked to my UOB EVOL. But not sure where to use in hawker centre. I think maybe in shopping mall  but not for daily expenses.,btohqsg
Hawker use XNAP and pay by Apple pay,btohqsg
I hope you didn't accidentally keyed your OTP into a malicious site that looks like UOB.,btohqsg
Ok  thanks. I did it this morning. Very good!,btohqsg
Nope was the real website..this morning i tried and it was all good.. thank god,btohqsg
It's written quite clearly in their t&c that credits expire the moment your account is marked inactive (no successful transactions for 1 year). You can try appealing but might not get back since you're not the first and there's plenty of coverage on this. You can still try.,btohqsg
luckily it's real. I thinking of the scenario where you are wondering why your OTP not working  but behind your back hackers are using the OTP to log into your real account.,btohqsg
May I ask  perhaps already asked many times by others -sorry in advance. But what's the site to check the merchant code associated with a particular business/company/shop?,btohqsg
Hi  which is a better move? Using CPF OA for early hdb mortgage repayment to reduce total loan interest incurred but lateron accumulating more AI or transferring OA to SA to meet FRS first?,btohqsg
Thats scary...and ya in this day and age..better to be careful .. scammers are getting too creative...,btohqsg
Google pay scan FAVE QR is still considered as PayNow  not FAVE,btohqsg
Hi   any DBS Vantage card users here?  Wanted to check if insurance premium payment also gives 1.6mpd or is that in exclusion list?,btohqsg
Surprisingly  I couldn't find any YouTube reviews of Vantage card from Chris.,btohqsg
Exclusion list  and it won't count towards spend to qualify for bonus miles too.,btohqsg
You can still get rebates if the vendor support rebates. And as previously mentioned  any payment via QR only via supported bank account.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA open in Apr  can i confirm i will get 4.35% interest on average incremental balance for Apr  May  Jun  and July (compared to Mar balance which is 0) ... And i can empty the account on 1st Aug?,btohqsg
David  Does Rent payment using CardUp qualify for bonus miles payment?,btohqsg
If I use google pay to scan FAVE QR  my bank account will be deducted. No record in FAVE APP. If I use FAVE APP directly  my credit card will be deducted and I will see the history. So I think using FAVE APP directly should be better.,btohqsg
If your 3 months average exceed $500  u can call in appeal. I called in for appeal and successful for multiple times,btohqsg
If you read the T&Cs for the promo bonus miles  they exclude cardup payments  though you'll still get the 1.5mpd.,btohqsg
Very hard to track for three months,btohqsg
Average  not every month must exceed $500?,btohqsg
Fave App and Gpay are 2 separate apps and thus using 2 different accounts. If you intend to use credit card to make payment via faveQR then use fave app.,btohqsg
yes if u sent sms in Apr,btohqsg
maybe only one time appeal subjected to approval,btohqsg
Average will be easier. If this month spend $480  EVOL no chance. UOB One still can spend $20 next month. I think multiple appeals don‚Äôt work.,btohqsg
"for the hsbc ega cashback on GIRO payments  do you guys know what does this ""excluding self-initiated GIRO payments madefrom the online/mobile banking platform"" means? can i GIRO my credit card payment to get the 1% cashback?",btohqsg
need to fill up and submit interbank giro payment form,btohqsg
example if i want to GIRO my UOB/maybank credit card bills  i need to submit the form from the respective banks?,btohqsg
Means during bank transfer you select giro instead of fast  that dont qualify for 1% cashback.,btohqsg
You pay yourself  which I think belong to self-initiated. You should use Giro to pay other parties.,btohqsg
ahh icic.. okok i understand now. Thanks everyone for the reply! :),btohqsg
can pay your own other bank credit card lah. Giro transfer to pay other parties (not billing organisation) no rebate,btohqsg
You can pay yourself  but I don‚Äôt think HSBC will give you cashback for this transaction.,btohqsg
üòÖ i think many gurus here have tried and tested.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt apply for HSBC purely for paying my own credit cards. UOB is enough for me.,btohqsg
Xnap is eligible spend 500 for uobone?,btohqsg
I am using UOB EVOL  not UOB One,btohqsg
Would use OA to clear the outstanding loan.,btohqsg
Oh I remember. You need to deposit certain $ to HSBC every month. Still no free lunch.,btohqsg
just a few minutes to trf in and out,btohqsg
2k right and 5 spend transaction on cc? quite simple compared to other banks!,btohqsg
Those who are willing to get the 1% rebate will do it. Those who are not can just stick to what they are doing now,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt even need 5 transactions on the CC actually. Just do 5 fast transaction out also can. (Eg HSBC transfer to your dbs account),btohqsg
Yes. It's quite straightforward. And the cashback is also credited one day after the giro deduction. All automated and no exclusion/ inclusion.,btohqsg
Sir is UOB Stash considering the fresh funds to provide the 3% existing interest rate + the additional cash reward as well for 4 months?I ask this because Stash account has a limit of 100K for giving out max 3K interest pa.,btohqsg
yes so to maximise this  it is better for those that can start with zero balance.,btohqsg
anything beyond 100k don't earn good interest,btohqsg
If UOB one account is not zero balance on 30 Jun  n open new Stash account in Jul  is it considered zero balance n can earn 3% + cash rewards on Stash account after putting $100k into Stash?,btohqsg
Whatever you do should be meaningful  not to find loopholes,btohqsg
I think 3% + cash reward applies only for the first 100KAny fresh funds above it are eligible only for the cash reward not the 3%.,btohqsg
Uob one connect to kpitam app and xnap will earn points?,btohqsg
Meaningful means you really need to deposit. Not today deposit tomorrow withdrawal just to get the 1% rebate. Why does HSBC operates a bank and give you 1% like that?,btohqsg

Then no need to open CIMB. Thanks,btohqsg
Currently I pay USD to IBKR from DBS. No charges because of same bank.,btohqsg
If I want to withdraw from IBKR  just convert to SGD by paying some conversion fees. Unavoidable.,btohqsg
You should stick to your current method.,btohqsg
I broker USD to CIMB auto convert SGD.,btohqsg
Maybe I still need CIMB account. Receive in USD auto convert to SGD. so maybe I just need a SGD account not USD account.,btohqsg
So far I think only CIMB inward remittance free. Other banks charge inward remittance fee,btohqsg
Wasted steps and waste time.... Just convert at ibkr. It is fx rates  comm fixed at $2 or $2.50 usd forget actual price.....,btohqsg
No.Capital.comwill remit USD to me by TT/wire after card fully refunded.,btohqsg
Just now earlier u say ibkr. So tot u asking ibkr.,btohqsg
If I make profit fromcapital.com  I will withdraw $ and deposit to IBKR.,btohqsg
This is good. IBKR USD to SGD charge $2. Then withdraw to any local bank.,btohqsg
Capital.comis for trading. IBKR is for investment.,btohqsg
Without CIMB  whencapital.comremit USD200 to me  I need to pay TT/wire charge $30.,btohqsg
Could you please confirm whether it is accurate that the YouTrip vertical card will be compatible with Apple Pay? Additionally  when can users anticipate the integration of this functionality within the app?,btohqsg

So this 2088 points is bonus points from my previous month spend?,btohqsg

Ya i buying usd. I was shocked all the money changer quote me around 1.35 in china town. Got one quote me 1.33 i scold him why so low. Then i think again that seems to be the best offer. But his stall no people,btohqsg
What did he say when u scolded him?,btohqsg
Weird qn but any credit card to use forparking.sgapp to pay for parking? üòÖ,btohqsg
SGD1.33 to USD1 is better than SGD1.355.You only pay SGD1330 for USD1k.,btohqsg
I just raise my voice and say how come so low and i walk away angrily. üòÇ lucky i went there again i talk to the lady. When i checking my cash the old man came back üòÇ,btohqsg
give good deal also get scolded,btohqsg
May I know what is the current credit cards promotion in Singapore?,btohqsg

Would like to seek all Shifu advise. If there a way to pay for your monthly insurance premium and earn Cashback or miles?,btohqsg
Don't think is real. Most likely is scam. Later got commission etc. üòÇ Do u think their profession is money changer don't know how to check fx rates. üòÇ Even u know is 1.35....,btohqsg
Just wrote an email to CIMB. Let the CIMB officer advise me which bank account or debit card I need in case I am wrong.,btohqsg
Too good to be true to buy @1.33 now  share the places so we can sapu if it‚Äôs ever real ü§£,btohqsg
If you buy USD  the lower price the better. If you sell USD  the higher price the better. Money Changer has two prices. You need to tell them buy or sell. They need to make a living from the difference.,btohqsg
U shld bring along a calculator and do the sums....,btohqsg
But kana scold some more üòÖ,btohqsg
if it really work  can use evol or other better cards to pay SP via 7-11?,btohqsg
I think SP does not belong to retail. But telecom belongs to retail.,btohqsg
Well you can see  bill payments via Cash and Nets only,btohqsg
Try to pay online or by credit card. I think is better than NETS.,btohqsg
I am also not very sure. If cannot pay by credit card  I will try Giro by HSBC since there is salary credit at UOB.,btohqsg
For me  1st choice is online transaction or mobile contactless via EVOL  can get 8%. 2nd choice is UOB Absolute  can get 1.7%. 3rd choice is HSBC giro  can get 1%. Am I right?,btohqsg
UOB EVOL must exceed $600 monthly,btohqsg
Omg u are right. I ask them 2 times they say 1.33. I use the calculator they give me to key in the rate. At first i didnt get her figure then i ask her and key in. The calculator figure matched with her figure. Then i check the note‚Äôs quality i think ok.Then i go change my Cambodia riel in another money changer  he ask me if i still want to change USD anot. Then i told him i changed at 1.33  he ask me check the receipt. Then only i realised i changed at 1.355 üò≠I use their calculator key in twice. Lesson learn better to use my own calculator or pay extra attention to the rates when key in. Lucky my exchange rate loss is about $13 sgd. I think it is a good lesson i learn.,btohqsg
"They like to play like that one.. and don't forget the ""admin charge""  charging you for them using the money counter ü§™",btohqsg
Usually prefer to change less cash  and use cards like YouTrip  Trust  etc. and pay in their local currency,btohqsg
I also got ask them if got any fees or commission they say not. I think i was too excited about having a good rate that why i didnt check the receipt,btohqsg
Hahaha rarely have no fees one.,btohqsg
I took photo of the receipt and notes. Cause i scared they give me fake notes by telling me 1.33,btohqsg
Uob one connect to kpitam app and xnap will earn points?No one knows?,btohqsg
Hi anyone know whether citi rewards works for all online payment? Including tech stuff?,btohqsg
Except travel related and the normal cc exclusions.,btohqsg
Hi all  for dbs multiplier ac  can I self credit the salary portion using SCB or other banks?,btohqsg
The 4.75 is not fees. She ask 745.25 i give $750. Its the lose change she give back to me,btohqsg
Oh yeah it's sell. Hmm weird way to put it haha,btohqsg
No  only salary via GIRO with PAY and SAL transaction code is considered,btohqsg
Hi I read before for UOB  we can earn the 2% interest for salary if we do transfer at least $2k from other bank. For the transfer we must do giro? What are the comments we need to put in?,btohqsg
You can use SCB or dbs to transfer‚Ä¶ UOB not very strict,btohqsg
You can still earn 0.4% if you do PayLah! retail spending if you're under 29  or 0.55% if you connect SGFinDex and do PayLah! retail spending >=$500 (no age limitation).,btohqsg
Hi  I understand UOB is not very strict. what i mean is that for the $2k transfer from other bank. We must key in something like Sala credit? I want to know what is the exact comments we need to key in and also must it be giro or fast is acceptable.,btohqsg
I did it from dbs choose salary and fast. It works,btohqsg
If u read the link  payment is by cash‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Select FAST payment follow by Salary and under comments key in PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
Errr you only change 550 how they cheat you?550x1.33=731.5,btohqsg
The uob card anyone managed to get the blue one straight without having to use the pink one first? Wonder what's the eligibility and criteria for the invitation.,btohqsg
He changed 750 sgd  if it was 1.33  he would have gotten 563 usd instead.Or if they go by tens  560 USD with 5.20 sgd change at 1.33Compared to 550 USD with 4.75 change at 1.355That's a difference of 10 usd + 0.45 sgd.,btohqsg
1.33 was probably the usd sell price. Probably miscomm somewhere,btohqsg
Ya probably 1.33 is USD back to SGD.Always calculator. Even if calculator very hard to rig the calculator.,btohqsg
should high net worth customer who spend big on uob card.,btohqsg
He became the sucker because never pay attention haha,btohqsg
:( I really want it it looks so good ...,btohqsg
Work hard to be high net worth loh haha,btohqsg
Can annual income below 100k but above 80k apply for uob lady solitaire  card,btohqsg
Can try. There are people who claimed that they managed to get the card even with a lower income than the required 120k. 100k maybe  80k pushing it a little.,btohqsg
Hi all  do I have to keep 2k minimum to prevent incurring fall below fee before I receive the BI from EGA? My cycle just ended.,btohqsg
Haha what's high net worth? Need put money in uob or high income or high spending? Any one of those can? It's so secretive,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows when is the UOB one card cashback credited at the end of the quarter,btohqsg
Shopback hawker with uob lady card get 6miles per SGD?,btohqsg
If I don't activate a credit card 1) would I still be liable to pay the annual fee or an early termination fee?2) would it affect my credit score?Thanks!,btohqsg
yes. please call and cancel asap.,btohqsg
go get this instead. looks much better.https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/benefits-of-the-amex-centurion-black-card,btohqsg
wouldn't that lead to an early termination fee? or should I activate the card  hold it for 6 months then cancel it?,btohqsg
just received the card in the mail  but now that im eligible for UOB lady's card  it makes better sense for me,btohqsg
then you should just activate it since it's free first year anyway.,btohqsg
Got the plat charge but black card cannot lah my income too low. That one need 1mil per year right lol and I wouldn't spend so much annual fee for the benefits. Only the concierge is worth it. And worse thing is no 6mpd only 0.8mpd or sth,btohqsg
Almost all High salary cards are pretty bad. Only 1 worth is ladies solitaire.If not just go for uob Kris Cc for no limit.Or DBS altitude for 5k / mth travel limit.,btohqsg
But got 4nf and unlimited priority pass,btohqsg
annual fee for lady solitaire can be waived?,btohqsg
There are 7.8mpd ü§£ü§£ü§£ if you know what to buy,btohqsg
I'm wondering if it's worth keeping the lady credit card once it returns to earning 4mpd  especially if you already own the PPV?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm still wondering how to spend $15k on the plat card to maximise the welcome benefits ü•≤ that has stopped me from applying haha,btohqsg
If you can get the AF waived  you can continue using it. Just select travel. Uob ppv doesn't cover it,btohqsg
Hmm  did u mean Citi rewards? I thought Uob ppv should cover travel?,btohqsg
Nope. I believe PPV covers travel if you use contactless but if you book air tickets online or make hotel bookings online  ppv doesn't cover them,btohqsg
I have been getting the hour glass but nth else seems appealing atm. Not very flexible. And up to 16k or sth,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know about that. Thanks for highlighting.,btohqsg

Is Fullerton USD cash fund good buy?üëç,btohqsg
IMO exchange rate is not favourable now,btohqsg
If u enter on a high now and usd drop in the future.... Ur earnings could be affected significantly,btohqsg
People speculate that FED might increase rates again this year. If they do USD likely will strengthen. But If they sudden decide not to  it will devalue against SGD alittle.,btohqsg
Yes theres another 2 small hike coming as per jerome powell said in the congress.... But SGD usually reacts accordingly to maintain the balance,btohqsg
But i have to say ever since i entered into the cash fund since april  the 7 days yield has been mostly above 5%,btohqsg
The only deterrant frm my putting in more money is the forex.... Somemore webull's forex spread quite lousy,btohqsg
No lah. Someone help to explain to me that my fx rate loss is only 0.005*550 by changing money with them. They earn my business but they lose my trust,btohqsg
I only change money with moneychangers who show the forex board publicly,btohqsg
Not until end of this year,btohqsg

Can we get cash back if we spend the hospital/medical bill using Citi cash back plus?,btohqsg
Just wanna share with you on Amaze/Youtrip/UOB ladies cardWent to JB on a Sunday yesterday these are the rates I got from spending using various cards:Youtrip: 3.423Amaze:  3.363UOB:      3.428JB Money Changer: 3.42Amaze rate sucks but if you spend sgd2k worth you get 2000 points which you can change to SGD20 in cash in the wallet.But the difference between Amaze and UOB in SGD2k of spending is RM130 or   SGD38 if you use money changer rate.Conclusion is you are better off using UOB than Amaze cos you save more (SGD38) than what Amaze can reward you (SGD20) for using their card on a SGD2k spend.I‚Äôm truly surprised by how good UOB ex rate is and in this case it‚Äôs even better than Youtrip.What are your FX rates experience using other bank credit cards?NB: need to clarify now that after the UOB transaction is posted with the FX fee  the rate is 3.321. It‚Äôs worse off than Amaze. So conclusion should be that Amaze is still the card to go to stack on your MC for overseas transactions.,btohqsg
you didn't add in the reward received from the linked Mastercard to Amaze.,btohqsg
UOB as in SG UOB credit card ? There is no additional FX fees?,btohqsg
There will be a 3.5% FX fees not?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure about that. I‚Äôm just using actual conversion rates that was charged to compare.,btohqsg
need to include all fees and rewards for a fair comparison,btohqsg
should use Amaze+uob ladies instead. uob credit card incur 3.25% fx fee  higher than Amaze (mark up of about 1.8% less the 1% instarem rebate),btohqsg
With the FX fees on UOB  YouTrip's rate would be much better. If done comparison for 1:1.,btohqsg
Any good FC deals for july?,btohqsg
So is it better now to pair uob lady card with amaze now ?Compare to Citi reward master card,btohqsg
Why is it a choice? Amaze can pair with up to 5 Mastercards,btohqsg
yes if mcc is under the selected category for 6mpd  amaze+crmc still good for other mcc (except travel and other exclusions),btohqsg
next time try use trust card and compare!,btohqsg
Then how come my actual rates show Amaze is much worse?,btohqsg
Nice experiment  but have you watched this?https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM,btohqsg
uob transaction not yet posted? can see if the 3.25% is included after posted,btohqsg
I can see the transaction. Status is pending. I spend RM18. The Sgd charged is $5.25. So the rate is 3.428.,btohqsg
For UOB  you have to wait for the txn to be posted after a few days to factor in the actual fx fees. U can take a screenshot and compare a few days later after it‚Äôs posted; usually +3.25% fees,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see any yet. Ok I will monitor when it is posted. Thanks.,btohqsg
Are your data points at the exact same time? Or different times throughout the day?,btohqsg
The rates you see on Amaze alr includes the 2.5% fx fee. Your UOB transaction will either include the fx fees later  or the fx fees will appear as a separate charge.,btohqsg
the UOB lady card  if take bus/mrt does it award the 6mpd?,btohqsg
You can use trust card. The FX rate will be better.,btohqsg
"https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:001812:160223-evergreen:bau&vid=MindshareSGYes  pg 9  SimplyGo under Transport category 4111But you need to enrol in ""Transport"" for that quarter",btohqsg
Uob lady is depend on what cat u enrol for the quarter  only selected catergory have 6mpd,btohqsg
Yea. Transport is one of those that is hard to earn rewards..,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt the interest be 416 if you maxed out everything at 100k,btohqsg
Mastercard will accumulate the transactions for simplygo. Something like $10 or 5 days whichever comes first,btohqsg
Do anybody know Legoland is under travel?,btohqsg
Correct  ok bah  cos Master card under simply Go  they consolidate and charge per week. visa is charged daily,btohqsg
actually uob lady bonus 3.6mpd and 2mpd is based on cumulated spend in the month rounded down to nearest $5  not $5 block per transaction,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs different from other UOB card,btohqsg
different from ppv and prvi  similar to visa signature,btohqsg
Yolo is the old name of Evol.,btohqsg
EVOL is used to be called YOLO.,btohqsg
"hmmm sifu.if i have UOB 1 and everyday. Which card is better for simplygo and Geneco.I check  it seems everyday got rebate for POSB for recurring leh.. but i dun want to do recurring..  see until @_@"".. i just wanna pay Geneco  SP and Simplygo",btohqsg

What did you do? Toggle off and on everything?,btohqsg
This one no one can answer you  only Apple know. But normal credit card seems to work on iPhone,btohqsg
oh..amaze + citi rewards mc also can if offline in sg ?? i thought only overseas üòÇüòù,btohqsg
You can use the keyword ‚ÄúAmaze applepay‚Äù to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Once you have both cards then can try..likely it is pool together.,btohqsg
it is pooled to hit the $500 for One account but you need $600 spend per month to hit any cashback on the EVOL anyway,btohqsg
i will use evol to make insurance payment to hit 600 instantly  then online payment can start getting cashback first dollar up. the rest like dining and grocery use ladys cardüòÅ,btohqsg
works right? assuming my categories for ladys card is dining and grocery la,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think insurance is considered eligible spending for uob evol,btohqsg
unfortunately i believe recurring insurance payment does not count towards the minimum $600 spend for cashback  but it does count for the $500 minimum spend for UOB One account,btohqsg
Thank you! And thanks Mouse Hunter too üòÑ,btohqsg
It does not work for Evol cashback but work for UOB one account interest. Insurance is excluded from Evol $600 requirements.,btohqsg
One more thing you need to focus on is UOB interest $500 requirements is based on calendar month while Evol $600 requirements is based on statements month.,btohqsg
oh i thought the insurance payment wont qualify for cashback but will still go towards the 600 spending. oh well need to do slight tweaks then,btohqsg
Nope. For UOB EVOL exclusions for both qualifying spend and cashback are the same. So insurance etc won't go towards the $600.,btohqsg
Tldr: those excluded from cashback is also excluded from clock spending for most cards  including EVOL.,btohqsg
Not really. It depends on what they put on T&C. DBS Live Fresh has a separate exclusion list for qualifying spend and cashback. Like insurance and wallet top-up will still go towards the $600 for DBS Live Fresh card. Same for most DBS cards.,btohqsg
That's why I said most cards  not all cards.,btohqsg
Most would be wrong. OCBC cards are all following the same principles as DBS. Most cards have different exclusion list from spending. UOB cards are the ones which have the same list.Tl;Dr just see the exclusion list on your card's cashback t&c. See if it's just for cashback exclusion only or includes spending as well.,btohqsg

Probably none as it's under EZ-Link and all EZ-Link transactions are excluded from most if not all CCs.If you know how much you spend each month on public transport  you might be able to count if monthly concession is worth taking instead of the 10% cashback on DBS Live Fresh  8% UOB EVOL  etc.,btohqsg

But why does their CEO have a pay raise?,btohqsg
If your flight is below $1000 hsbc revo is okay ~ but if more than DBS altitude could be a option,btohqsg
Must lost a lot in the coin value.,btohqsg
but do agreed on the point of that it based on your daily expenses and get the card that would suit your needs.,btohqsg
just to be clear... Amaze is just like another YouTrip right? If i just get Citi Rewards and not paired with Amaze  i just lose out on the foreign spending benefits right? trying to avoid having so many cards üòÖ,btohqsg
Amaze converts everything to online  so using Amaze+citi rewards mc earns 10x points on anything so long mcc not excluded. Without Amaze  using citi rewards overseas in-store only gets 10x points for fashion mccs and incur 3.25% fees.,btohqsg
i see  so i cannot use citi rewards in store when im overseas. thats all right??actually use youtrip card will incur fees? i always thought theres no additional fees if i convert to the respective currency,btohqsg

Honestly I don't know what's the draw with EGA 1% cashback for HSBC revo card. Given you'd definitely not spend beyond $1K on the revo card every month  you'll earn at most $10 cashback from the EGA every month. But the amount of work you'd have to do to earn the $10 is just not worth it IMO,btohqsg
transferring 2k and paynow/use credit card to make payment for 5 times only,btohqsg
the draw is 1% on giro bill payment,btohqsg
That is also not really worth it because it excluded a lot of categories of bills like utilities which would be the ones I'd normally pay on giro. Other bills I think you get more paying using the appropriate credit cards compared to giro. But I admit I could be wrong here as I didn't study the EGA T&Cs in details.,btohqsg
1% Cashback + 4mpd that is quite a good earn rate for 5 min of trouble monthlyTransfer $2k and immediately transfer out 5x,btohqsg
but paying the other banks credit card bill using HSBC giro itself already earn you 1% cash back. I might be wrong  but AFAIK giro on everything will earn u 1% cash back aside repaying HSBC credit card,btohqsg
yes when u tap on your profile in app  it shows premier,btohqsg
4mpd you get regardless of EGA. 1% max you'll get is $10. Not worth it in my view. But that's my view lah.,btohqsg
Thanks. I can see how this is worth it. But I don't like to put my credit card bills in giro. But once again that's me üòÜ I get paranoid with paying my credit bills like that.,btohqsg

The best benefit is pay IRAS bill using GIRO. Esp if your tax bill is high. 1% cashback is substantial,btohqsg
Cashback easily few hundred$ a month,btohqsg
Adding on: Insurances should qualify too (I personally use it),btohqsg
I think they got this free membership online called Wildpass that let's you buy at a discounted rate  not 100% sure tho,btohqsg
I think my IRAS bill is considered high. I pay for it using citipayall. In exchange I get about 200K air miles  which can redeem a return flight to the US on business class costing $6K. If I had paid using EGA  1% cashback cannot even buy me a single trip ticket to the US on economy class.,btohqsg
Once again I want to stress the above opinion is my own only. Not forcing anyone to subscribe to it.,btohqsg
Why not both? Citipayall for payment then EGA giro to pay off the cc üòä,btohqsg

I am not seeing any interest for my deposits in statement so far and it July now. Am I doing it correctly? If I didn‚Äôt do correctly then my interest gone case.

If you already have a fixed D and would like to used the current one with a promotional rate say 3.55% then the rate will drop to 2.3% once u use it as collateral for a secured credit card. This was what happen to me and I decided to put a separate 10k at 2.3% and keep the current FD at 3.55% that was placed sometime last year. Not sure if it varies per the knowledge of the counter staff but good to clarify when you are there,btohqsg
Currently have SDD FD with Citibank  completes next month  thinking of placing that in a USD FB (The UOB rates look even better),btohqsg
Thanks. So the welcome gift as indicated in the photo I sent just now is not from singsaver.,btohqsg
you converting to USD to place?,btohqsg
Yes was considering to convert the entire amount from SGD to USD once matured and place it into the FD,btohqsg
oh so if i choose singsaver means no more welcome bonus from citi le ah?,btohqsg
other than the obvious risk(fx which can go either way  you lose sdic protection as well. so in the (unlikely) event uob somehow dies  you wont get your money back because sdic dont cover foreign deposits,btohqsg
this applies to all banks in singapore  so you can look at all the other banks you are comfortable with and compare rates,btohqsg
UOB Stash at 3% (must maintain at or above),btohqsg
You can workaround the salary crediting requirement for UOB One account,btohqsg
Are you able to hit $500 minimum spend?,btohqsg
How? Asking for a friend as he will be working in DBS and his salary have to be credited there,btohqsg

$90.50 for concession  more expensive than you tap daily,btohqsg
What are the requirements to have your credit card annual fee waived normally?,btohqsg
Depends on where you stay and how much you want to travel la. If you stay at clementi and study at NUS then maybe dont need concession pass. Plus $90.50 is for both train and bus and some students travel mainly by one mode of transport only.let ppl do their own calculations and decide whether its worth it or not.,btohqsg
Is Altitude AMEX and Altitude VISA $5 000 cap separate?,btohqsg
Depends. Some banks state in their tnc if you spend a certain amount it will be auto waived. Generally if you spend on the card regularly the appeal to waive should be successful also,btohqsg
Does crmc with amaze get cashback on movies at cinema?,btohqsg
90.50 is lesser than what I spend on bus/mrt in a month. Lol. Everyone got different public transport spending.,btohqsg
Every bank and card has different behaviour. Why not state the card so people with ample experience will shareFirst condition. Spend a bit on the card. If the card is just gonna sleep in the drawer preemptively cancel it,btohqsg
The usual criteria is to spend. The more you spend  the easier to ask for waiver. For some cards  if you hit a minimal spend every year they'll auto waive it for you.Otherwise it's up to discretion of the bank already.,btohqsg
hi can I check which bank has the highest interest rate if i only crediting salary. no card spend and bank value no more than 20k at any moment,btohqsg
Ocbc if can meet save criteria too,btohqsg

Anyone else applied for ocbc 360 account online with Singpass but took quite long for the account to be opened?,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Can I check is non rewards qualifying spend contributed to the card monthly minimum spend. Eg. Insurance premium $300 can contribute to the ocbc 365 card minimum spend of $800,btohqsg
Depends on your card's t&c  some do some don't,btohqsg

Eg. Singtel shop at jurong point. M1 shop at tampines?,btohqsg
