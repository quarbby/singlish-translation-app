Cannot pair amaze with trust card because trust is visa. For pairing with posb passion debit card it should work since its a mastercard  but I don't see any benefits of using posb passion debit card for foreign currency transactions,btohqsg
POSB Passion + Amaze gives better rates than DBS Visa debit  can be useful for people who can't hit min spend of $400,btohqsg

I forgot that POSB Passion is now a Yuu card as well. Just wondering does the card give any rewards for non-Yuu merchant spending?,btohqsg
I'm also participating in Paylah shop dine travel challenge  spend goal is $160 so I'm just trying to clock spend then ditch the card,btohqsg
1% Taka rebate and that's about it for now,btohqsg
I currently only have Visa debit and POSB Passion debit cards from POSB/DBS,btohqsg
Actually we need more coverage on debit cards. For small spenders who shop at Yuu merchants  I think POSB PAssion Card is not too bad.,btohqsg
POSB Passion only got 0.5% rebate at Yuu merchants I thought,btohqsg
