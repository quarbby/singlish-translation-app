Yes  u can do 1 way biz  one way economy. Whether it’s worth it or not depends on your valuation of a mile & how much you value the business class leg. If it’s a long flight and u manage to redeem J savers (assuming SQ)  it’s actually a decent option,btohqsg
Do search for “easy money had been made already”  you should get my views on your question. Good luck,btohqsg

Hi  if I top up my Starbucks card at the store itself and use PayWave like credit card  how does the bank know I’m not paying for coffee? They can only see the MCC right?,btohqsg
Yes  the cc terminal used is the same as transactions used to buy coffee  mcc no diff,btohqsg
Thanks  cos the credit card T&C say wallet top ups don’t count. But I just thought it was weird cos I don’t see how they can differentiate,btohqsg
They probably referring to grab wallet  shopee pay etc,btohqsg
Because Starbucks card credit  you can only spend in Starbucks and no where else ~ hence you are just prepaying your purchase from Starbucks ~But for grab wallet   shopee wallet   YouTrip etcThe money top up can be use to spend anyway so there isn’t data to be captured by the bank side so it isn’t worth giving points to there ~If you top up to Starbucks card  the bank can know this person love Starbucks maybe we can push Starbucks promo to this person,btohqsg
