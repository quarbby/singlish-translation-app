currently dealer are seeing around 10% of customer looking at ev  and it will be about time soon we see a major revamp in car industry,btohqsg
I have seen some dealer nearby selling off quite some EVs. Especially Honda E. Looks like demand quite significant. But Chargers wise still slow in installing somehow,btohqsg
actually that isnt good also?? if MG EV is pushed to cat A  wouldnt cat A COE increase alot as well? i really doubt that the cat B COE went so high because of MG though,btohqsg
Singapore is a funny market   tesla like in China is number 1 selling car across all segment and increase price monthly,btohqsg
I see Tesla ma. Got demand Hahaha. Soon Model Y coming in and Kia EV6 see their fight soon. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Yes but other ice model can‚Äôt compete due to mg got 40 k rebate,btohqsg
Ev6 no match for model y in Chan and such   maybe in sg yes   as model y omv is at 82 k,btohqsg
must see they set at what price also ba. if they set 135k before COE den it might not be seen as an attractive deal,btohqsg
That is like a 7 series,btohqsg
i think we all go back to i3s liao HAHAHA. hoping they bring in citron ami in!,btohqsg
Tesla sure 130k Before COE. Model Y maybe. But EV6 i dk lea,btohqsg
u can try google model y news  basically is dominance in most part of the world,btohqsg
ev6 and ioniq 5 should be higher ba,btohqsg
Thats why my China friends all driving Model Y sibeh rich HAHAHA,btohqsg
model y   s and x is so top selling that singapore got no stock at all,btohqsg
can anyone here comment on byd interior quality? is it similar to their japs/korean counterpart?,btohqsg
Even model s we need wait for 2 years plus,btohqsg
Currently model 3 is also a 3 month wait,btohqsg
forget it ba  model s the pricing should be quite insane in sg. previously hong seh sold it at 400k++,btohqsg
i think even if tesla sell direct to us  will still be around high 300k due to new tech and coe,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt he as omv is 130 k,btohqsg
this is for the base model ba ,btohqsg
Omv is 130 k   arf around 200 plus k after discount then coe 90 k is at least 400 plus k,btohqsg
U can count the basic cost from omv then throw in dealer margin,btohqsg
as in when u say omv is 130k is for the plad version?,btohqsg
My Friend say Model Y selling in China 317800 CNY Equivilent to 68K SGD,btohqsg
Can use it to gauge the omv,btohqsg
Singapore omv for standard range model 3 is at 59 k,btohqsg
yups 140k no opts though. i think by the time add in the options can overshot 150k omv,btohqsg
Tesla will be the new badge brand for modern car buyers .. BMW and Merc too 2000s liao üòÇü§£,btohqsg
hahaha surprise not byd. they did try to do well in sg market though,btohqsg
Think for EV we should like omit this ARF thing so when we scrap we get back $0 but that'll also help offset the purchase price,btohqsg
Arf cost more then coe for luxury car   and this is where the main tax is,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just look at coe but not arf   sometime Depent on car model the arf is way more then coe,btohqsg
ARF will determine PARFBuying price minus PARF divided by 10   will give you depri per yearPeople buy car based on depri right?,btohqsg
Ya what I mean is generally ppl complaint above coe make the car so expensive,btohqsg
Can we dun have COE? the car already puapeh expensive HAHA,btohqsg
Cannot dun have COE la hahaha. If dunwan COE our roads really will be like India liao,btohqsg
4 lanes but got 7 cars on the road side by side,btohqsg
COE should Reduce to 5yrs LOL,btohqsg
Now at least 1 lane 1 car. Hahaha,btohqsg
HAHAHA I dk about those driving home 5-6pm and go work 8-9am kind the road so congested u wanna save fuel also no chance. HAHA.,btohqsg
