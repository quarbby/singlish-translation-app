no eh i nvr got lost in ikea,btohqsg
so i walk straight line can ahh,btohqsg
they should change the densest material on earth from osmium to you,btohqsg
As someone who drives the car as much as you,btohqsg
Sometimes need to show at traffic stops,btohqsg
go police station say u lost and stay at dempsey,btohqsg
idk it just comes with the app,btohqsg
and why wld u ask me that here,btohqsg
But he‚Äôs not hazel. He‚Äôs not that extra,btohqsg
As many times as she wants to blame her haters for her eating disorder instead of going to the gym to stay fit,btohqsg
Issokay. It‚Äôs the thought that counts,btohqsg
This is how you identify a 13 year old boy  anything a girl says they just ask this question,btohqsg
CB at least spread good songs,btohqsg
U mean u dont track yr stuff either bro,btohqsg

Does that mean you're accepting that you're a ladyboy?,btohqsg
fucking spinners in whichever MV that was,btohqsg
Cause my feeling is just so right?,btohqsg
as we dance by the moonlight?,btohqsg
i hope your aussie chicken rice doubles in price,btohqsg
I learn how to make already,btohqsg
i hope australia has a chicken shortage,btohqsg
No I just use ready to eat rice  roasted chicken and soy sauce,btohqsg
You do realize that Singapore gets chickens from Malaysia and Australia,btohqsg
i will bank on the hopes that our neighbours up north can tahan,btohqsg
the soy sauce wouldn't hit the same,btohqsg
i think they add sesame sauce? the thinner consistency type,btohqsg
actually can try substituting for dark soya sauce,btohqsg
The best you'll get here is machetes,btohqsg
So if you hear a Mazda 3 with pops and bangs,btohqsg
that doesn't work well with chicken,btohqsg
You don't have to run to find shelter,btohqsg
You can be sure it's a car,btohqsg
the dark sauce works well with rice though,btohqsg
The tools I have are a kettle and microwave,btohqsg
I'm not sure if it'll survive,btohqsg
smuggle them in and we'll do a shady deal at the back of dempsey,btohqsg
imagine not having the newjeans meal,btohqsg
how else can the tradies survive a 12 hour day driving around in a white hilux with a bed rack,btohqsg
they are praying on my downfall,btohqsg
if you aren't drinking and driving then you aren't driving,btohqsg
Hi TP please fail him in the next test,btohqsg
He is planning to drink and drive,btohqsg
i hope your australian car gets pulled over for illegal mods,btohqsg
i've heard alot of stories of people with stock pipes getting fucked over,btohqsg
It depends on the bogan's mood,btohqsg
see? just proving to the system that i'm a safe driver!,btohqsg
ya man do u still drive this,btohqsg
Anyone heading down the bsmt meet tmr?,btohqsg
yes you can lock a car in a chamber,btohqsg
also wtf im in halal land,btohqsg
What do you expect to do with this?,btohqsg
idk if rare anot but i usually see this car,btohqsg
Why tommrow car meet so far sia,btohqsg
quite? we have about 15-20 units,btohqsg
this is the worst take on a Morgan i've seen to date,btohqsg
would people buy Supras because they're BMWs underneath? or McLaren F1s?,btohqsg
ppl that buy morgan‚Äôs don‚Äôt care much abt the underpinnings,btohqsg
it‚Äôs the coachwork and design broo haha,btohqsg
Or should I say it like you talk to other people,btohqsg
that‚Äôs like saying lotus is toyota wish substitute,btohqsg
Eh stop it ah@SuicideS4enough of you alr,btohqsg
"""i don't buy a bugatti because it's a VW underneath""",btohqsg
@ArghMeinGottyou might've found someone even more dense,btohqsg
"""a Maybach is just an A Class""",btohqsg
Y'all like to feed the trolls uh,btohqsg
Lotus used to be owned by msia if u know didn't know but was bought over,btohqsg
Not the type of 911 we chatting about,btohqsg
I need to change its blinker fluid,btohqsg
ntuc have  check the seafood section  near the sotong,btohqsg
Right thanks bro  brb washing my car with this.,btohqsg
Think 97 cause like the higher the number  the cleaner ur car i think,btohqsg
Not particularly  it's just more stable and suited for higher performance cars,btohqsg
Usually just pump 95 can alr,btohqsg
they were trying to wash a car,btohqsg
I genuinely prefer petronas 97 to petron 100,btohqsg
so he meant cleaner in that sense,btohqsg
LET THE PLACEBO EFFECT STILL AFFECT ME THANK,btohqsg
so I could only do petron 100 or v power racing,btohqsg
fuck it just pour in vodka,btohqsg
v power racing was definitely better,btohqsg
Come i tell you the holy trinity of malaysia fuelShell V Power  Caltex Techron  and Petronas 97,btohqsg
pour vodka into my mouth instead,btohqsg
Imagine having a high performance car,btohqsg
does it make you increase HP,btohqsg
imagine having an elephant on the b roads,btohqsg
i always thought it was more 40/60 F/R,btohqsg
bias changes if put into off road mode,btohqsg
until i slid in my carpark,btohqsg
when are you entering formula drift sir,btohqsg
Wgt change bias FR all the way,btohqsg
Front load brake bias for maximum kek,btohqsg
wgt shit yourself beside a large lorry,btohqsg
i think the lorry can outdrag a miot,btohqsg
especially ones that have J plates,btohqsg
Depends on how much load they have and how much will to live i have tbh,btohqsg
@shitboxenjoyerhow much sleep did you get,btohqsg
Exactly FR where got power bias,btohqsg
eh wait did the NA come with open diff stock,btohqsg
Well  the base model ones did,btohqsg
94 onwards had the lsd option,btohqsg
Too late I'm on an lsd now,btohqsg
good luck driving on the roads,btohqsg
Funny thing about the lsd is no one knows what the hell it is,btohqsg
cause when you turn  your inside wheel will turn at the same speed even though it doesn't need to,btohqsg
and your will fuck up your tyres,btohqsg
and also can't power in a corner,btohqsg
locked diffs in a fwd cla,btohqsg
It was a diff he bought from a workshop  workshop say lsd  but they dk which brand.Then he take home try install cmi cuz his 1.8 auto.So he sold it on buyee,btohqsg
So long story short i have the sussiest fking diff rn,btohqsg
i guarantee 90% of the people here dk,btohqsg
but u install lsd means less slidey üòî,btohqsg
can bring me test anot i offer $1 for sit in carcar,btohqsg
$1 i go from carpark lot to the adjacent lot,btohqsg
do you have any vague idea,btohqsg
Yeah it's one of three basically,btohqsg
or is it just throw caution to the damn wind,btohqsg
people here cnfm think lsd is some turbo or what +200hp cock,btohqsg
I've narrowed it down to two brands now,btohqsg
can. u do one round of sg back to adjacent lot.,btohqsg
There's not much 1.6 lsd options  like 5. Two of them lock aggressively  so that's definitely not what i have.The remaining three brands are  OS Giken  Viscous or Mazdaspeed.It's definitely not a viscous because it locked once.So i either have an os giken or a mazdaspeed,btohqsg
$1 good deal bro i don't have much money ü•πü•πüôèüôè,btohqsg
if it's a mazdaspeed it would fit quite well with your car,btohqsg
Inb4 cusco 1.6 but iirc they lock aggressively,btohqsg
have you compared the two visually?,btohqsg
like stock images on google HAHA,btohqsg
When i sell the car it's gonna have the description,btohqsg
best offer 1.50 and a can of redbull,btohqsg
I haven't even cracked the diff open yey,btohqsg
because no one knows the fuck it is,btohqsg
Or you could put this in,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a vert so I‚Äôll let it slide,btohqsg
Eh guys does this look like GTR or GTST R33,btohqsg
Anyone heading to the meet haha?,btohqsg

wat does it mean to be a true gtr tho,btohqsg
What is a definition of a true GTR,btohqsg
so... the original Hakosuka isn't one?,btohqsg
that's like saying the E30 M3 isn't a true M3  neither is a 166MM a true Ferrari,btohqsg
R31 is the best non gtr skyline,btohqsg
