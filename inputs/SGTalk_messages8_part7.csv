We have just assisted a old lady that fell at the side of the road going tpe to jln Kay at the middle of sk and pgl area. We have called the police to assist her  i just posted so the family can be outreached earlier if found missing as she may have dementia.I would imagine the family will be worried sick.Kindly share so her family can see this earlier as she said she has 4kids then she said she's alone. So we are not very sure.,btohqsg
