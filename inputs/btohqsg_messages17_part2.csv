Keep cash with u  cash is king.,btohqsg
If they ask u why that date no work etc. say layoff lo,btohqsg
Now everywhere is layoff  its common,btohqsg
They will make adjustments for u.,btohqsg
From my understanding of how it runs  im guessing they dont want people to buy beyond their means  so thats why they give a lower loan amount.But if u are legit case  they will up the loan for u.,btohqsg
Cos their calculator says i can loan up to 700kBut when i apply  they give me 300k -.-!,btohqsg
Then when i appeal  they ask me how much im short.I say 100k  then they say ok grant u 400k.,btohqsg
"It is their way of going ""prudent"" loaning",btohqsg
Cos previously the HLE goes this way ...both couple apply for 1 HLE  base on the HLE amouunt  look for the flat u want to buy,btohqsg
So in my case if HLE say 700k  people are gonna look for a 700k flat.which will take donkey years to pay back,btohqsg
So there's a bit of basis behind their decision,btohqsg
hahaha! yeah  $700 000 loan would've been insane. anyway  thanks for sharing! I hope all goes well for me,btohqsg
Hi  mind sharing how long you waited for this bto...?? 4-5 years? Which bto (name)?,btohqsg
Garden Vale at Tengah. I got it under the SBF exercise  so the wait wasnâ€™t so long. I applied in 2021. At that time  they said the delay was going to be 1 yearâ€¦ but it turned out to be 2 years,btohqsg
Sorry just curious ah  what if you touchwood rejected for second HLE? Am planning to move funds from OA to SA so abit concerned if future HLE gets rejected when nearing to collect keys,btohqsg
U wont get rejected for HLE.HLE is just loan eligibility.HLE just tells u how much u can loan from HDB.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check with you on this. U mentioned u appeal and resubmit to get this amount. Was there a big difference in ur salary increment or just the same? Was it very complicated for them to give a higher loan?,btohqsg
I have just appealed for mine,btohqsg
Not for a huge increment in loan but an approx about additional $50k-70k.,btohqsg
No incrementAnd not complicated. Just submit the same exact thing.,btohqsg
I have been waiting for 1 year and still counting lol,btohqsg
Can we cancel HLE after we get our keys? Because we calculated that after 5yrs  old CPF is enough to fully pay the BTO.,btohqsg
Just tell them you wanna pay up fully using CPF during your key collection can liao,btohqsg

Hi Group  I currently got a number from August last year  however have yet to go for appointment. Is it still possible for me to book for the upcoming May project? Would I lose my chances for May if I didn't go for my appointment?,btohqsg
Yes possible to book as long as you haven't selected a unit. Once you select  all other ballots will be forfeited,btohqsg
Noted  however if I didn't select I would be subsequently penalized. And that penalty would not effect my q for may?,btohqsg
It won't affect the ballots you have on hand,btohqsg
Hello all! Wanted to check if anyone has dropped out of the MCPS scheme and has any repercussion to it? Our queue number is pretty far but our parents changed their minds not wanting to be tied down by the MOP,btohqsg
After lease signing  if my combined income exceeds the 14k for BTO  what happens? Or it wonâ€™t matter by then?,btohqsg
Need to wait till you received the appointment letter/application package to know if you are under MCPS first.Chances are if your queue number is far out  your ballot is likely not from MCPS already.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter as you have already locked in your HLE liao. HDB won't fault you for earning more income.,btohqsg
HDB will only headache if we unable to pay e mthly installment....,btohqsg
