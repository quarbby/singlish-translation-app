Asiaphos sudden awakening and run from $0.008 to $0.024 on Friday (200% gain) have woken up some micros as top20 volume had several micros in them.The micros have not been played for some time and with a leader finally emerging  the stage is set and thus focus should be on this segment.They have rested far too long and power is stored.One micro that have seen prior accumulation during the last spike up to $0.020 in 8 Dec 21 is Sitra and since then they have went to limbo with liquidity removed as they flushed out most.$0.014-Buy call ☎️ should be the start of the bounce up. Friday looks like some player have started to accumulate more too.,btohqsg
ICP weekly chart for reference. We can tell the the volume have picked up in recent weeks.Friday  we seen hidden buyers at $0.010 although sellers came to throw too.Hence  this should indicate some player accumulating the chips at $0.010.(As mentioned I have noticed someone been collecting this one for some time and therefore I termed this one the dark horse)Previous spike up seller throw down and outright block $0.010 after $0.010 was cleared but then recent Friday  each time thrown down   it got flipped up back. Don’t think retailers got so many bullets ?Anyways  firm buy call at $0.010 since- hidden buyers here and- the fact that they let a 100 shares close it at $0.011 on a day where sellers came to throw $0.010 signifies that it should be ready.- $0.009 was too hard to collect recentlyHence  watch closely and for now  $0.010 is a buy and there might be some final throw down to shake off some before the push up comesAnyways  DYODD as we must react accordingly to market sentiments.,btohqsg

Where’s our Big Boys at. Paging all BBs for this week micros party 🎉,btohqsg
New wave ($0.009/$0.010)🌊- $0.009 hidden buyers seen on Friday.- Nice volume on Friday and hope to see more buying interest.Asiaphos 200% run will be the key catalyst to wake up all the sleeping micros as those who missed this will be looking out for the next possible runner .All should keep a micro watchlist this period.I like the micros because if right on  the wins can be real big.PS: $0.011 main Resistance for this one. If break clean then might see a power move.Let’s see how whether BBs favour this.,btohqsg
Ultra Micros ($0.001 to $0.005) not yet. The play now seems to be micros $0.006 to $0.01x.,btohqsg
After this then focus on the ultra micros,btohqsg
