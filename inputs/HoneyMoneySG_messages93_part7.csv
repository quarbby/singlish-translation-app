Hi hi.Anyone know how to appeal with OCBC cc for late fee waiver? Call in and rejected.Also  they didn't send gift (applied early last year)  besides appealing with ocbc  can threaten to complain to who ya? üôà,btohqsg
it depends on the reason why you were late.if it was due to carelessness  many banks are not waiving it anymore as they see that as their rightful source of fee income.,btohqsg
Just cancel your card.  SC is also very strict on late payment  minimum $100 fee. I immediately cancelled,btohqsg
i also had same issue. die die say want to charge after seeking waiver like 3x. in the end i say ok i pay  just cancel my card. in the end after many months of no action they finally waived,btohqsg

if you have an unresolved late fee and you cancel the card  legally you are still required to pay the late fee and any associated interest charges the late fee had incurred.annual fee is the one that you are no longer obligated for if you cancel.,btohqsg
what if it's annual fee and that is late and you didn't pay that fee,btohqsg
if you had cancelled the card before Due Date  you are not legally obliged for all of it.,btohqsg
Ocbc? No action means? Haha so did you really cancel your card and pay the fees?,btohqsg
Haha cancel still need to pay right?,btohqsg
Anyone has try Syfe cash + flexi usd?,btohqsg
Hi. Just wanna confirm that UOB one credit card will look that the qualifying spend for quarterly cashback based on 3 statement months instead of 3 calendar months?,btohqsg
Also they will start from Jan-Mar  Apr-Jun  Jul-Aug  Sep-Dec yeah? Mean you cannot choose when you want to start like Feb-Apr  May-Jul etc?,btohqsg
mine is stanchart. i paid the fees then keep asking them to cancel but dunno why wasnt cancelled. few months later i go in app to see its already waived,btohqsg
do you still pay the late payment fee even you cancel?,btohqsg
Anything even come close to the 6mpd from the UOB Lady‚Äôs card? Sad to see the promo end on March 31,btohqsg
nope.. it is/was the best 6mpd card for Travel/Dining/Fashion spend.,btohqsg
yup that is why i didn't state groceries..because all along UOB Lady wasn't worth it to use on Groceries.,btohqsg
Cannot choose the quarter. The first quarter starts from the date of application. For mine  application was in August  so the first quarter is August to October.,btohqsg
I see. Cso told me it is always Jan-Mar as first quarter first. Mine application is on 21 Feb. Billing cycle starts on 13th of the month. Cso said my first quarter is 13 Jan - 12 Apr and so on. Cso said they will waive off the 13 Jan - 12 Feb first month cycle cos my approval date is 21 Feb. Means they count cashback 2 out of 3 months exceptionally,btohqsg
Strange. They told me it's based on application date of the card. Anyone else can chime in?,btohqsg
Yup. Makes more sense if starts on application month,btohqsg
Tnc stated first statement month is the approval month.,btohqsg
I see. I will ask them again based on tnc. First month should start from approval month,btohqsg
is StanChart Smart worth to take?5.6 mpdi have spotify and youtube suscription,btohqsg
5.6mpd is not bad  but risk of orphan miles if you only charge spotify and youtube subscription to this card,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if I scan the Kris+ QR code and pay using DBS wmmc  is it considered an online transaction?,btohqsg
Which card is best to replace UOB lady for buying plane ticket after the april nerf?,btohqsg

Any tips on how to get first 200 new-to-UOB credit card promo?Need something that posts to UOB as quick as possible,btohqsg
You need to make sure they reverse the late charges because annual fees are no longer payable. Otherwise it‚Äôll affect your credit score,btohqsg
Need to be quick when it releases lor,btohqsg
UOB promo rewards first 200 to spend 1k on credit card for 2 monthsPurchase needs to be posted to UOB system  so need something that posts quickly for my purchase on 1st March,btohqsg
Does anyone know what time does Endowus invest my deposit? I received an email saying it will be invested but didn‚Äôt state the time,btohqsg
"but i wouldnt try for UOB promo ba  1st 200 is so ""scammy""",btohqsg
U means that dragon $1288 promo?,btohqsg
For uob stash / uob one?,btohqsg
i think they meant the CC sign up rewards for 1st 200 to spend 1k,btohqsg
Agree  most bank the same I think  skip it rather than regret,btohqsg
How much can U get with 12.5k for those saving account like SCB and uob?,btohqsg

I guess 3.8% at least right? Hmm sorry I am not financial literate that‚Äôs why seeking for best advice from you all,btohqsg
There are many hurdles to clear for the high interest saving account. And with 12.5k actually u don't get much per month. SSB is good for long term. And 3+% for 10 years I personally think it's a decent one for 10 years.,btohqsg
Yes  just pay and never ever deal with Standard chartered again,btohqsg
Want a better interested saving rate...for acct.   Any recommendations apart  from cimb?,btohqsg
