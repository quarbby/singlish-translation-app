Maybe on aircon for a few hours then fan blow ?,btohqsg
air-con. then off. then on fan,btohqsg
Just imagine on aircon and fan the same time,btohqsg
I always do that actually lol.,btohqsg
only when i am going to sleep i usually off air-con then just leave the fan on,btohqsg
that would be one heck of a repair,btohqsg
I usually on 25  quite cooling ler,btohqsg
at that point  more worth to just buy new one ?,btohqsg
probably better in the long run,btohqsg
relay the pipes so in future easier,btohqsg
hmmm i cannot sia... need 22 and below with fan,btohqsg
when they install the air-con they never put properly,btohqsg
so the drainage always backflow a lot,btohqsg
when even there is a little bit of build up,btohqsg
cause the hole they drill is higher then the aircon itself,btohqsg
so a bit of build up(normal) will result in back flow then leak,btohqsg
I'm sleeping with either 20 or 19 degrees.,btohqsg
punggol. hmmm i think first batch too,btohqsg
so now even i replace new air-con no difference,btohqsg
