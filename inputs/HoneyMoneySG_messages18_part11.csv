What credit card can I use to top up revo. I don't need any cash back or miles. Just need 0 fees for cash advance purposes,btohqsg
for now visa still canin future only MC will get zero feees when toppping upoffcourse no cashback whatso ever when topping up revo,btohqsg
Agree... Amaza spread is too high  not able to justify the cashback,btohqsg
Topup for prepaid card usually have no cashback,btohqsg
Mastercard is good  bank topup is great [if you have DBS],btohqsg

Had been using Amex-GrabPay to top up revolut.Is there any other eWallet that accepts Amex topups?,btohqsg
Wouldn't instarem give u back 1% too (in the form of points),btohqsg
eh? What's the nerf?I also hold metal now but was considering if to stick with instarem till the $20 mark for my upcoming trip before hopping over to revolut,btohqsg
Yes. I do know that.Thus have to move on from that direction.My question was  is there any eWallet that accepts Amex topups,btohqsg
Do note that if u treat revolut as cash advance too often it might trigger their system,btohqsg
Unless your cash advance refer to oversea atm withdrawal,btohqsg
ahha unless if not revolut will black mark him and u know its what next gonna happen,btohqsg
Overseas withdrawal is acceptable use of credit card funds,btohqsg
My bad  I believe you should complete the 20$ mark and switch over,btohqsg
Once banned banned forever by revolut. My friend kena,btohqsg
That's true. Don't milk the cow till it dies.Bring it out to pasture and feed some grass to it. Add some other transaction which adds value to Revolut.,btohqsg

ah didn't know  thanks for sharing,btohqsg
Lol. If you need to top up to build your credit score then do as you please. But canâ€™t get miles or Cashback  so I guess the only good thing is pay later Lor,btohqsg
