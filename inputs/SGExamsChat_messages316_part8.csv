For advanced u can promote but have to sit for tests at the start of J1 I think,btohqsg
Or u can also choose to retain without appealing,btohqsg
Alright thank you so much for the info  hope you get your desired outcome üòÅ,btohqsg
My friend got 10 raw 8 nett,btohqsg
He went to np and paid 50 dollars for last minute revoking,btohqsg
That‚Äôs for from poly to jc,btohqsg
Appeals within the own jc to switch stream if you meet the COP will be higher ofc,btohqsg
As in he revoke eae last min,btohqsg
Ya but ur friend wasn‚Äôt appealing outside of Acjc to switch stream,btohqsg
And he didn't rly give much info during the interview,btohqsg
He kinda sad that he didn't get into ac,btohqsg
But he living his life in jp,btohqsg
Crushing everyone in his class lol,btohqsg
He got like 77.5 rp in y1,btohqsg
If he did stay on with NP he could have just JAE into AC the next batch,btohqsg
But if he got 10-2 might be rejected from science this year,btohqsg
He wasn't too happy because he compares jp standard to other jc standard,btohqsg
Like one of my friend got 75 rp in ac y1,btohqsg
He did well for his prelim during sec sch,btohqsg
One of the toughest course to get in via eae,btohqsg
He didn't want to waste any time,btohqsg
He isn't willing to pay 1.4k per sem,btohqsg
If ur friend had put Acjc sci last years confirm would have been accepted,btohqsg
Since there were ppl with 12-4 getting inside,btohqsg
This year even ppl with 10-2 are getting rejected,btohqsg
He couldn't even do his jae,btohqsg
So end up this year AC rejects quite a number of them going RV lol,btohqsg
So RV becomes the sch for AC rejects,btohqsg
By default once u get your eae your jae cannot do,btohqsg
Those which got 10-2 and put AC science first then RV sci second,btohqsg
You eae into poly you can jae into jc,btohqsg
Ur friend didn‚Äôt know that so that‚Äôs why didn‚Äôt try?,btohqsg
But cannot Jae into another poly course,btohqsg
The o level cert said sth like no jae or sth,btohqsg
Was told that for JC can still apply using Jae even if a spot has been reserved in a poly,btohqsg
Your friend should rly have logged inside the Jae system to check,btohqsg
Cos even if he thinks cannot no harm checking,btohqsg
