Yeah I guess 4.65% is worth the effort,btohqsg
This intense MAB tracking/gaming effort effectively is for the 1.5% save criteria only... üòÖThe salary and spending is another set of effort,btohqsg
Can someone advice me about whats the issue of depositing money on a non working day? Does bank only recognise the deposits on working days and hence the MAB wont be moving on non working days?,btohqsg
Transfers only get cleared on next business day.,btohqsg

"Hi gurus of ocbc360 acct..Can i ask how do you guys reconcile with the ""save"" criteria exceeding above the 100k?1. Doesnt the extras above 100k lose the interests? How many months then shd we do a reset so that the loss is justified? (I read 5mth  but dont understand the rationale..)2. What is the reset strategy? Zero out the account and deposit to somewhere else for one month? Or just reset to 100k?",btohqsg

Is zym sim only plan worth it? Offer looks tempting but just wondering if anyone here uses  are the data speeds great? Any issues with zym?,btohqsg
Been using since August 2023 and no issues so far,btohqsg
Is the data speeds good? Any issues on the train?,btohqsg
Recently been a bit choppy but my friend who uses Gomo also said the same so I suspect is SingTel problem rather than zym,btohqsg
No lte is fine ig just wonder what provider has great speeds,btohqsg
Volte.. not lte. Speed also depends on coverage and congestion. If you're in a place very packed with people on the same MNO  then you'll be impacted.But also depends on the MNO's equipment... If it's cui like S....A then even if you're the only one there with the best coverage  you may still end up with a horrible experience.,btohqsg
When does the 20/ 40/ 60 days begin?The 20/ 40/ 60 days term will begin upon your first subscription into USD/ SGD Cash Plus.

And  if you top up another S$40 000 (total S$50 000) to Cash Plus  your 40-day term will begin from the first day of subscription.,btohqsg

anyone make specs from JB and ask them to courier bac k to singapore adddress?,btohqsg
Trf out the excess  and lose the save bonus don‚Äôt seem like a good trade off,btohqsg
Most specs only require 30 mins to 1hr in jb. So I doubt. But I got courier contact lens before,btohqsg
ya just go get your prescription and choose your frames  go makan  come back finished liao,btohqsg
Hi  for the EGA 1% cashback on giro  the capped of $300 is it counted by the cashback credited within a calendar month or the giro debited in a calendar month?,btohqsg
cashback. so basically capped at 30k of spend spread across GIRO and HSBC credit cards,btohqsg
problem is we won't know when they will actually credit the cb back to us. TnC says within 14 days which is kinda big window period. Say i have a 50k bill to earn 1%  split across 2 weeks which is last week of this mth and 1st week of next mth  if cb for the first split got delayed to next month  then $200 worth of cb will be gone.,btohqsg
The cashback usually credit within the next week or next few day. Only 1 delay encounter to be a week plus,btohqsg
It‚Äôs based on transaction date. I happen to transact at the end of the month and cashback was credited in the beginning of the next month. So I got cashback partially only. I added all cashbacks received in transaction month and found out that hit the limit already (transaction month cashbacks + partially received in the next month = $300),btohqsg
from JB? do the specs company provide it if we pay a sum -- why so its cause of progressive lens need takes weeks,btohqsg
your transaction date means is the GIRO deduction/debited date?,btohqsg
CC transaction posted date was at the end of the month  cashback received in the beginning of the next month (1% of it).,btohqsg
So if my giro is $30k and my hsbc card is $50k  i still get only $300 cashback??,btohqsg
U can upgrade to premium for monthly 500 cashback,btohqsg
