Hope annoying telegram groups won't be the next pandemic,btohqsg
If that dude whose message I forwarded and deleted (coz I feel might be dox) is legit  I really facepalm.,btohqsg
I mean youâ€™re free to be in any group you want as Long as you donâ€™t harm people  but common sense would tell you not to reveal your profession in those spammy grp,btohqsg
Admins should check the recent actions  I think we found the culprit bahaha,btohqsg
People whoâ€™ve been spotted adding members here to their spam group,btohqsg
Not courteous to just add people indiscriminately into their group,btohqsg
They are probably a group of uni students who feel that it would be fun to start a project like these,btohqsg
Anyways if you can change your privacy settings to only be added into groups by your friends,btohqsg
People making covid 19 free tuition initiatives and shit,btohqsg
A pandemic and all you think about is resume,btohqsg
Heâ€™s known for doing that probably,btohqsg
Some group that added a bunch of people here in,btohqsg
Probably just didnâ€™t want him to say anything,btohqsg
I think our education system wired the students to be too opportunistic,btohqsg
I donâ€™t mind people saying theyâ€™d give tuition for free,btohqsg
They mute instead of ban because they want the numbers lol,btohqsg
Even if they might be motivated by their resumes,btohqsg
I wonâ€™t deny  I been through a phase of wanting to do something becauseðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘MY RESUMEðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘But then after awhile Iâ€™m just like  while people praise me for what I have on paper  it just highlights how I feel I have nothing substantial.,btohqsg
Provided they actually put in the effort to tutor and not just lip service for resume,btohqsg
They are actually sliencing speech in that group,btohqsg
Messages about joining the group are deleted,btohqsg
Such a sneaky game they play,btohqsg
Maybe just for this group I should just record all their messages,btohqsg
Can I put Valued Contributor on my resume and not be laughed at by 198% of the hiring population?,btohqsg
VC is one of the most highly valued roles nowadays,btohqsg
i was added to that grp,btohqsg
Nothing you can do except leave,btohqsg
Their admin added a bunch of people from this group to theirs,btohqsg
Wonder why telegram still doesnâ€™t have the ability to hide group memberships,btohqsg
Maybe it means they are gonna continue adding more people if they put slow mode,btohqsg
Post something then edit it after a while,btohqsg
Maybe your messages will last longer,btohqsg
I see my clone has arrived,btohqsg
plenty of fishes in the sea,btohqsg
That is the month of June,btohqsg
Lol i was added to that group also,btohqsg
For us hehehe  not for them  not for them,btohqsg
Can you write a script to screenshot all their messages,btohqsg
Oh well June is holidays for us also,btohqsg
Though wait a minute  having a 13 week term with a mid-term break is legit them having a taste of a Uni Sem hahaha,btohqsg
Screenshots would be annoying but i could probably write a script to get all messages sent in the group,btohqsg
Anyway i left already and reported as spam,btohqsg
For 25 weeks only have 1 week holiday for them,btohqsg
Iâ€™m calling it Recess Week coz itâ€™s literally a Uni Sem alr LAWL,btohqsg
