I tell u ah. SATS food is gd cuz they catered for planes is a lie.,btohqsg
Their catering sucks even for airport lounges.,btohqsg
best if the west side one leh imo,btohqsg
I went to a lounge operated by them in T4. The food sucks.,btohqsg
But somehow the camps in west side under sats nt bad leh,btohqsg
So after this exp   I have no expectations for their catering lo.,btohqsg
Like 3/5 of the days is edible,btohqsg
Maybe coz all the high rank eat there,btohqsg
Maybe cuz no choice. Such a depressing place. Food is the source of motivation.,btohqsg
I feel that both also substandard.,btohqsg
$2 for a big ass lemonade,btohqsg
Prob they came from same central kitchen,btohqsg
Ya i got see their kitchen,btohqsg

But tekong one is just snacks ah coz night time le,btohqsg
Mine served Hor Fun for $3,btohqsg
Oc allow us to go two times  last two weeks before pop,btohqsg
cookhouse food i only can trust noodles,btohqsg
Like howu fk up a plate of hokkien mee,btohqsg
Noodles is always the safe choice leh imo,btohqsg
I think for SATS food ah.. Any $3-$5 meals can beat their taste.,btohqsg
Tbh my taste buds like damn diff from when im still in tekong,btohqsg
just diff feels ah after u pop,btohqsg
Is js the way it is.,btohqsg
Js donâ€™t order anything when u fly with scoot.,btohqsg
This is what they served on my recent trip.,btohqsg
I think the catering is not from SG. Seems to be airlifted from overseas.,btohqsg
But the taste is not bad.,btohqsg
Muffin   shortbread   sandwich with fruit cup,btohqsg
I think is the pate if uk what that is?,btohqsg
Aiya. Is not Biz. Canâ€™t expect too much. At least not bad ah.,btohqsg
and sq wldnt serve such small,btohqsg
did it come with a tray?,btohqsg
I agree. It was quite nice.,btohqsg
At least it wasnâ€™t tuna spread.,btohqsg
like a paste made out of meat like chicken  pork etc.,btohqsg
why haven't I eaten such a thing,btohqsg
I was abt to say out of all my holidays I only fly sq but it's not exactly true,btohqsg
I tried Japan airlines and as expected the Japanese food was cold on another level,btohqsg
i find Qatar worse than sq tho,btohqsg
idk for all ik jap airlines had to be the worst experience for me,btohqsg
i been flying with...budget airlines my whole life,btohqsg
bloody hell my mother never take for me,btohqsg
Issok   I tried Scoot & Tâ€™way.,btohqsg
u take sampan to Tekong also hor,btohqsg
Ah. Do u prefer that or Haagen Dazs?,btohqsg
the one for emperor to sit inside,btohqsg
wtv as long as got ice cream,btohqsg
eh but W for Muslim meal get the food first bcz I bloody hungry sia,btohqsg
it is also the 1 thing that people always throw,btohqsg
I had white pear whays that ah,btohqsg
Ya. I think the fruits are ok for planes.,btohqsg
Except now for some airlines   they serve it in a cup.,btohqsg
If non-halal   can book in adv.,btohqsg
idk my father book one hor,btohqsg
as someone who loves to travel  m upset my mother only lets me travel w friends after 21,btohqsg
eh not too bad now tho,btohqsg
but I JS wanna go on a day trip to jb,btohqsg
my first time going overseas with friends was uni,btohqsg
then again i also had no friends to go overseas with,btohqsg
when i was 18 you were 9,btohqsg
i've been overseas with friends twice now,btohqsg
once for a few days to Bintan after year 1 of uni,btohqsg
second after graduating for grad trip  2 weeks+ in europe,btohqsg
grad trip man. went all out,btohqsg
it's also extremely not cost efficient to get macs there,btohqsg
Or even supermarket groceries. I got mine from Germany & Austria.,btohqsg
supermarket still ok la i felt,btohqsg
like ok compared to sg yes but i just stopped trying to compare,btohqsg
and just knew it wouldn't be super cheap,btohqsg
True. Js there to have fun & all.,btohqsg
oh yea Austria was so cheap though,btohqsg
cos we went Switzerland -> Austria -> Germany,btohqsg
but then ended in Amsterdam soooo,btohqsg
u go to Austria   sure sudden dip in spendings.,btohqsg
I was there when I was a kid. Maybe things chnged a lot.,btohqsg
yea it was. like top 10 in Europe,btohqsg
unsurprisingly the other top are in Switzerland,btohqsg
i'm sure you can guess Zurich is at the top,btohqsg
I thought St. Moritz is the one?,btohqsg
might be. i saw that  Zurich  Geneva,btohqsg
yea so the Matterhorn at Zermatt,btohqsg
i got that iconic picture with the toblerone bar,btohqsg
Did u buy the bar in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ or buy from overseas?,btohqsg
i just bought it from the Zermatt shop,btohqsg
nah it was literally last year May to June lol,btohqsg
uhh my entire 17 day trip cost 5k,btohqsg
I can rmb the ride up to Matterhorn costs $80+,btohqsg
we booked our flights early so return trip SQ was only 1k,btohqsg
but ya for me i think I took the train up the Gornegrat,btohqsg
u got a good deal tho for direct,btohqsg
but in the future if go KL I wld rather take the train,btohqsg
ok my accommodation in total was about 750 SGD,btohqsg
$80+ train ride. Sure must keep.,btohqsg
the rest is just food and whatever we want to buy,btohqsg
I nvr buy the Swiss pass,btohqsg
we didn't find the swiss paass worth for us,btohqsg
like we wouldn't use it properly,btohqsg
Now they keep promoting it. I find Eurail + the discount card a better deal than Swiss pass alone.,btohqsg
god the last time I went europe was 7 years ago,btohqsg
Ya  but i mean the only places we went that needed transport outside of train was Geneva and Zurich and we just get day pass,btohqsg
we also went Brienz so just walk,btohqsg
I only took ktm to jb I think,btohqsg
can I just say that my trip made me love the Swiss trains SBB,btohqsg
For Brienz   I only got off the train to took a photo.,btohqsg
I love how we're having two convos again,btohqsg
ohh  yea stayed there for 2 nights in like a nice cottage airbnb  right next to the lake,btohqsg
one of my German friends alr warned me,btohqsg
uk that day I took one ICE that was delayed by 50 min. That â€˜s how suck it is.,btohqsg
I wanna try bvz forgot that experience,btohqsg
oh man if only you could see my friend gc,btohqsg
we had one day where we just went separately to do whatever we want,btohqsg
my friend wanted to visit Heidelberg and Tubingen,btohqsg
but he got stuck in Heidelberg because the train kept being delayed,btohqsg
My friend â€˜s friend also. Supposed to go to Paris from Frankfurt? End up got cancelled. Took the very long route to Paris.,btohqsg
oh we've had two more disasters,btohqsg
anyone know what happen to RP's cheerleading cca?,btohqsg
first one  we supposed to go from Salzburg to Stuttgart  and change at Munich for that. End up it got to Munich late so we missed the Stuttgart train  wait for next one. We happened to ask the station people whether we can still reserve seats for the next train  and they told us the train is leaving early  so we ran there and got free seats cos many people missed it,btohqsg
or is cheerleading not a sg thing,btohqsg
I heard that ETS seats are selling q well.,btohqsg
Damn. That â€˜s a bit disastrous. But turn out better in the end.,btohqsg
since I was in pri sch,btohqsg
He owes me a mountain trip,btohqsg
Second one is that my friend left Stuttgart for Amsterdam 3 hours earlier and had to stop at Frankfurt  while the rest of us went to Cologne. She missed her Amsterdam train and we passed Frankfurt before she left,btohqsg
I make sure I go find the chat,btohqsg
Messed up. Not to mention their only station in Switzerland was incredibly dirty. The name fits the station condition quite well: Bad,btohqsg
ðŸ’¯ yup my grades painted red 100% thx,btohqsg
gude  scared me I was like whos this,btohqsg
thx for giving me l1r5 6 kuro,btohqsg
I think Singapore js likes Ed,btohqsg
Tanah Merah got bedok view secondary school HOHOHO,btohqsg
Bro bedok.exe crashed at the main gate bfr he open house after climbing that mountain,btohqsg
I nvr heard of such thing b4.,btohqsg
äººå±±äººæµ· bro idek where that came from,btohqsg
But theirs are mostly the full-size ones.,btohqsg
Now got electric ones. Prob can brake better.,btohqsg
Depends how often u use such services.,btohqsg
Lol. The campus bus is not worth that much.,btohqsg
So I wonder what they want.,btohqsg
That one diff.. The food & cultural exp hits diff.,btohqsg
Somemore now the full fleet is China made electric bus. Cut costs.,btohqsg
there's always something to complain about,btohqsg
The other thing is leftover commission into the pocket. Who knows. ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I thought they own the land since they are after all owned by the govt.,btohqsg
They waste a lot of electricity in some places.,btohqsg
No wonder one of the camps I went to took so long to fix up an air-con in the office.,btohqsg
I read this nights chat and it's such an old fuck conversation,btohqsg
that's if I even go uni zzzz,btohqsg
Next time you will get excited about buying home appliances.,btohqsg
That â€˜s when you are the old fuck.,btohqsg
Imagine u bump into siyan and den u see a kid beside him which turns out to be me,btohqsg
Well. I was at the Tamp branch and saw the ad.,btohqsg
Bedok sees me w my bf too,btohqsg
