Cause I brought her to sasa in JB. I sign up membership. She bought like worth sgd660++ worth of products (only 1 box of skincare) n my jaws dropped cause I sign credit card help her pay as she didn't bring enough cash 🤣 then the staff also happy lah less than 10mins do 1 big sale.. so she goes around telling us can get what free gifts.. naturally since my empress got her sgd660+ worth of skincare  she dont care about dr wu  so i took them 😅,btohqsg

Shopee not necessarily cheap. Honestly it's getting ex nowadays. I heard they got high admin fees imposed on sellers. So end day the sellers will reflect onto the products,btohqsg
But try to use vouchers seems cheaper. Then use shopback,btohqsg
Taobao n Lazada also can use shopback it seems.,btohqsg
My sis frd went hooga. Now good sales. I think rm200 can deduct some cash? Like rm50?,btohqsg
Like the app u open  search Lazada before payment  then click to continue. Once u receive the stuffs wait like 2weeks  u get the cashback %,btohqsg
They got nice room diffusers  my frd bought those too. I got mine from TB,btohqsg
So the cashback here. I can transfer that money to my bank or to buy at shops that use shopback,btohqsg
My shopback referral code if anyone dl 🤣🤣🤣🤣....  5T9mJa,btohqsg
Now seems a lot of app got link to it,btohqsg
Ok shopback already more than 1yr,btohqsg
Who knows when will toh. But now can use just make use,btohqsg
I like go supermarket  buy spices  herbs  Himalayan salt. Some of those interesting kewpie sauce. Cheap n good,btohqsg
