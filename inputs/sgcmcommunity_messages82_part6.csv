If she wants something cute  you want something reliable  get a swift,btohqsg
Look it’s not a bad car  and honestly  regardless of brands  you can find problem free cars. It’s all in the previous owner and preventative maintenance.,btohqsg
Only difference is cost of parts 😂,btohqsg
And the car you buy. Some cars maybe need a bushing replaced  others the entire car,btohqsg
so good...my insurance is so freaking exp 😭,btohqsg
Small hatch turboSwift sport 1.4Hyundai i30Small hatch fun and reliable1.5 honda jazz manual😜,btohqsg

But car insurance damn unfair. I converted and they don’t see my foreign license🤣,btohqsg
Continental car / sport cars / PHVs,btohqsg
Fail to keep safety distance.... Cos got video of another incident  the cam car kept a safety distance and did not rear end the car in front in a chain collision,btohqsg

Hi i am new member here,btohqsg
Want to chk with experienced membersBetween mazda 6 and camry hybrid  which one great value for money,btohqsg
Oh yeah  looking at the swift as well!,btohqsg
yeah man  it's always a hit or miss. I dont think its going to be a problem free car but if I'm only getting 1-2years left and half the time its in the workshop... hahaha,btohqsg
I did consider a V40 myself in the past but they run a little over my budget back then! Volvos are gorgeous,btohqsg
If maintenance cost is bore by someone else  than Cheong for conti lo. If not  better be kind to your pocket. Uncertainties are high in the near future  better have some cash on hand. I owned VW before  maintenance is higher than Japs and Korean. So stick with Japanese if you want reliability.,btohqsg
Thank you! Don’t want to fuss with too high of maintenance so that is definitely a factory we need to seriously consider.,btohqsg
VW not too bad tbh  it's the golfs specifically that have issues thanks to certain owners and the way they keep their cars. *cough* doctor gearbox *cough*,btohqsg
You're a newer p plate driver so,btohqsg
