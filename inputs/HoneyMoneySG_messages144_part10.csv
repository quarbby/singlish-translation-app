No FX fees but you pay a markup on the Mastercard rates  still worth it if you get 4 miles,btohqsg
I am in the same situation and have wrote to SingSaver. They are asking me to wait for 3 months. Am seeking clarification with them.,btohqsg

Hi  try to look for the samsonite luggage as a gift  which cc should I apply ?,btohqsg
Tiger 6.8% . How come never received my boosted interest on 9 Dec 2024 ??,btohqsg
If without the membership  may i know the difference?,btohqsg
Some cheaper rooms are available with membership tiers with different earn rates (bonus).It is still not a bad deal if you just sign up for ALL and convert.I got confirmation that it only works for room rates and not dining. So not so exciting now. Was thinking of the various buffets using MaxMiles at $0.028 to change for it ðŸ˜£,btohqsg
You do mean the paid membership? Sorry not too familiar,btohqsg
DBS Vantage is quite a common card for CardUp and a lot of us have it and it comes with Accor Plus membership,btohqsg
Hi  I have rental payment of around 9k a month  thinking to utilise the CardUp/ipaymy/renthero  is there any card for Cashback for this amount? Or not  what is the current best miles card for now?,btohqsg
Maybe split payment? At least use maybank visa for the higher cashback? Then DBS Vantage   do the signup bonus and pay continuously. U should be able to get 2nd year free,btohqsg
1. So 2k on the Maybank visa platinum then every quarter $200 received right?2. DBS vantage as in miles? See that cashback is only 1.5%,btohqsg
Yes for both. DBS vantage for miles,btohqsg

Have a look at singsaver and see which banks offer luggage. On top of my head  hsbc does.,btohqsg
No specific use gg fwd after fulfilling the promo criteria,btohqsg
Is this the best travel card so far overseas?,btohqsg
ah ok  then do what Anthony is suggesting and look for any card that might not have annual fee or is known for being pretty lenient with forgiving fee,btohqsg
for convenience and some cashback (with their cashback card) with near about best exchange rates  yes. if you really care about exchange rates  you might get slightly better rates from ichange or something but not very convenient,btohqsg
MCC for Alipay in China is so screwed up. ðŸ˜…3rd and 4th are F&B food stall and restaurant respectively.,btohqsg

sister you got use the UOB Visa Signature card?,btohqsg
any1 got experience using the UOB Visa Signature card can recommend? thinking to get this cuz 4mpd include petrol and cap at $2k,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a good card if you can spend min 1k every statement month.,btohqsg
ok  the UNI$ will be shown like PPV?eg  if spend $10 contactless  PPV will show1) 2 UNI$2) bonus 18 UNI$or it will consolidate follow like lady card?,btohqsg
Consolidate. 1x when transaction posts  9x comes in next statement month,btohqsg
