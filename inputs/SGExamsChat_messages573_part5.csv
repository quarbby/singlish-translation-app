Just give him a random subject,btohqsg
now you and your 14 yo brain can choose,btohqsg
if not let your mama choose,btohqsg
I got an idea  put everything into a random generator since every subject is just that easy,btohqsg
The chosen one shall be the easy one,btohqsg
since you are being so retarded,btohqsg
i feel that dropping out of school is better,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume ik,btohqsg
but fr  each subject got their own pros and cons  choose the one that you think you can put the effort in and do well without getting bored of it lol,btohqsg
it's funny how every ryan i know of always got something unusual,btohqsg
someone stop that retard  he is getting too smart,btohqsg
So smart until the real world can't handle them omg !,btohqsg
Do you know what is the easier subject now ?,btohqsg
ya ask her put random generator,btohqsg
Go find ECG counsellor at this point,btohqsg
put bio  phys and sign on,btohqsg
you got 1/3 chances of getting sign on bro,btohqsg
sign on easier  no math  no sci,btohqsg
U sure developing or galaxy brain,btohqsg
Galaxy until can totally not decide which is the ez way out,btohqsg
I'll be sure to ask u again in the near future,btohqsg
the trick to doing well for gp is to not go for gp lectures,btohqsg
Consider it a social experiment at this point,btohqsg
source: The top 3 performing classes for GP for my batch were the 3 classes with 0% attendance for all GP lectures,btohqsg
I'm more amazed than pissed off,btohqsg
Gp lectures are teachers attempts at complicating simple things so they have things to fulfill the curriculum with,btohqsg
My class 90% distinction rate for GP 100% AB,btohqsg
Cuz our cher told us don't go for gp lectures u gg waste ur time thr,btohqsg
or is it yall already good/ better than the rest to begin with,btohqsg
to clarify  lectures  not tutorials right?,btohqsg
Tutorials was held by my gp cher,btohqsg
orh no wonder okay then i agree lol,btohqsg
Who also told us to skip lectures,btohqsg
Everh 1h 30min tutorial is write one paper 1/paper 2,btohqsg
Wait isn't it bad if there's barely any attendance,btohqsg
Won't the teacher like snitch or smth,btohqsg
+ at least in my school  there are more people that attend lectures than those that pon,btohqsg
U see rite my cher would pull the move of,btohqsg
"""OH I'm taking them to do my own lessons""",btohqsg
Or that period becomes a free period,btohqsg
they not so free unless you suay,btohqsg
The cher is the one telling us not to go,btohqsg
He also released a bunch of shit we weren't supposed to get apparantly,btohqsg
"""Technically yall can't bring it home but I can show it to yall""",btohqsg
Which wad how I got access to the principles of marking for gp paper 1 and 2,btohqsg
Which is why ik how cambridge marks gp essays which is why all the more gp lectures are useless,btohqsg
And why ik that doing science and tech is a death sentence,btohqsg
Rly no one care if pon lecture,btohqsg
Is it diff for new GP syllabus now like p2,btohqsg
Connection qn is easy so like no change,btohqsg
