i mean the metal ring one,btohqsg
its like a shiny at that point,btohqsg
It's been a long time since I eventhoughtabout it,btohqsg
found it when i move hse etc,btohqsg
I wish we knew we were in the good old days before we left them,btohqsg
had this one china guy in my class,btohqsg
hes like darnn good at yoyo tricks,btohqsg
but at the same time crazy smart lul,btohqsg
Also some weird ass show named RobotBoy which I watch to this day?,btohqsg
"lmfao hci can have esports tournament but nyjc don't have cos some cher complain that its ""irresponsible""",btohqsg
shouldnt have said yes to ny,btohqsg
I think that is jumping to conclusions on their part,btohqsg
Why not tell the teacher to fuck off,btohqsg
lol the person not big enough balls to reveal themselves,btohqsg
why yall wan a esports tournament tho,btohqsg
i mean if yall can self org then go ahead ah,btohqsg
but some cher caught wind if it ig,btohqsg
they org then dont use the ny name,btohqsg
if they use the ny name  then need teachers approval,btohqsg
bruh if thats the case means some cher in hci approved it,btohqsg
ny basically jz dw to associate with like esports,btohqsg
tbh theyd rather focus on making sure yall get high rp,btohqsg
Ik they had it 2 years ago for the IP kids in hci,btohqsg
i know like one guy above the age of 25 who wants to be an esports player,btohqsg
once ur pass a certain age these kind of things is rlly uncool,btohqsg
ask your elder siblings / parents,btohqsg
why would the school waste money on something like this,btohqsg
Schools not even gnna waste money on it lol,btohqsg
What kind of thing is really uncool?,btohqsg
I think living after the age of 1 is really uncool,btohqsg
You get to make uncool remarks about other people's livelihoods as being uncool,btohqsg
why is it that every time i'm on here there's people arguing,btohqsg
Irresponsible young adults are the ones who can't see esports is more or less like any other sport.If you can respect an athlete  you can respect an actual esports player.,btohqsg
Since there's a really pointless view that thinks that 'esports is bad lol muh taxes' - I thought it be appropriate to categorically state that is not the case,btohqsg
"imo it's not that esports is a problem. it's bc so many people unknowingly become addicted  it becomes a stereotype. and in the eyes of many adults  esports is therefore a ""bad influence"" simply because they don't game",btohqsg
nevermind u all wont get it,btohqsg
There are a lot of things which are 'bad influences' - you don't see them disappearing from Singapore,btohqsg
There's no point in ad homs,btohqsg
"there are certain things ""disappearing""  and in the case of esports it's really bc there's not enough exposure bc ppl keep shutting it down lol",btohqsg
my uni has an esports club tho,btohqsg
FWIW  I'm not very hyped over esports in SG,btohqsg
There isn't anything like FakeR or the like,btohqsg
How do they know if ur going out with another person u live with or not? And live with means  u cant be less than 1 m apart from even the neighbour staying opposite urs?,btohqsg
can understand why the gov want to place laws and fines,btohqsg
after all thats the only thing that works in sg,btohqsg
but i think its all placed in a rush then its also quite confusing and sometimes dont exactly make sense,btohqsg
Do anyone know where else can print stuff since library and printing shops are closed,btohqsg
U have a month to finger it out,btohqsg
./configuremakemake installCheck theconfig.logto debug further. Also check what your compiler tells you.,btohqsg
do you mean figure it out....,btohqsg
i’m pretty sure you meant figure it out,btohqsg
bold of you to assume that a make file exists!!,btohqsg

every individual must stay at or in  and not leave  his or her ordinary place of residence in Singapore,btohqsg
What does ordinary place of residence mean,btohqsg
U just unqualified the entire term,btohqsg
sorry too chim dk what you’re saying,btohqsg
Means originally they say ORDINARY place of residence,btohqsg
U then explain that it means place of residence,btohqsg
ordinary means where you usually live lor,btohqsg
I just come back from UK,btohqsg
can write so atas but cannot understand english meh,btohqsg
Where got place I usually live,btohqsg
Please la the term has different interpretation,btohqsg
knn only want to find people to argue definition,btohqsg
Please la I got problem with this that's why I ask,btohqsg
U think I here to argue meh,btohqsg
Does it specifically mean the place of residence on my IC?,btohqsg
Cos I have been living on a rented place prior leaving Singapore,btohqsg
And I am not a legal tenant of that rented place anymore,btohqsg
U never even bother understand where I coming from then label me as such le,btohqsg
then the 'ordinary place of residence' in question would be the new place of residence you take up,btohqsg
to confirm your situation  you can call up ICA iirc,btohqsg
So u assume that ordinary place of residence means the one on IC?,btohqsg
Ok then changing ic address is leycheh as shit,btohqsg
but if you want confirmation  call ICA,btohqsg
maybe you can call them and confirm the procedure,btohqsg
I want rent my friend house now,btohqsg
this kinda situation need call them to ask,btohqsg
Ya la they never define the damn term properly,btohqsg
we unqualified af to give a certain answet,btohqsg
anyone know a android app that can run python code my dad is using my laptop,btohqsg
Otherwise just run an apk with python,btohqsg
I usually use jupyter notebook but I can't seem to find that on playstore,btohqsg
Android on notebook? Hmmm you can try just a regular python install,btohqsg
Still got some printing services that deliver,btohqsg
Im v confused and if it may last for 6 months if needed thats crazy,btohqsg
6 months of not meeting ppl  not even fam thats not living wif u eh,btohqsg
Doubt it will last 6 months,btohqsg
Best care scenario 4 May  or extended till early June,btohqsg
If CB works as intended then virus transmission should be extremely low again or zero  then measures can be lifted,btohqsg
If thats so  why are most internships getting postponed/wfh/cancelled?,btohqsg
Most internships in the summer start on 4th may or later,btohqsg
In case CB doesn't work as intended,btohqsg
my internship kena push back to 27th may liao,btohqsg
you should visit your gynaecologist if your CB doesn’t work as intended,btohqsg
internships are more valuable than studying cmon,btohqsg
Well if everyone stays at home and plays their part,btohqsg
It should subside by 4th may,btohqsg
but i can understand that some people have to go out to run their errands and whatnot,btohqsg
Ok obviously you can go out to do essential things,btohqsg
Ya im just saying that im going out for that,btohqsg
Govt puts it on the list of exceptions,btohqsg
Since gyms and swimming pools out of bounds now,btohqsg
what about running away from responsibilities.....,btohqsg
running towards groups of 9 people to make them 10....,btohqsg
who let kevin out of his mancave,btohqsg
Its now all gatherings/meetings of all sizes of ppl u dont live with as prohibited  not just 10 peeps,btohqsg
Wanted to just go grocery shopping with 1 neighbour friend but nopes  I think i can't do that too,btohqsg
the entire park is cordoned off,btohqsg
Even if the friend is so close,btohqsg
I thought 'public parks' are on the list of places u can go to,btohqsg
And idg the shared facilities of condos,btohqsg
Like gyms and pools also not open,btohqsg
was at JP just now and it's so empty inside,btohqsg
Pull up bar is the entire park,btohqsg
do you think we will have 0 cases at the end of cb,btohqsg
community spread is still quite serious,btohqsg
Time to order some pull bar to just fix at ur door there,btohqsg
I think cb will end when the rise in cases is not so high,btohqsg
but theoretically 1 month of staying at home should kill the virus spread right,btohqsg
Hopefully if we all abide that should be super few cases,btohqsg
1 month means beyond the 14 days incubation,btohqsg
actually general onset of symptoms appear mostly on day 5,btohqsg
So can tell who has and not and resolve most of it,btohqsg
Theoretically all virus carriers should be detected or healed,btohqsg
lets hope 0 cases end apr,btohqsg
will take a while for the economy to get back up once we tide through this period,btohqsg
i want to go out this home thing is making me depressed,btohqsg
T h e o r e t i c a l l y,btohqsg
Me too as a fellow extrovert,btohqsg
i can feel my back being screwed over from all the sitting,btohqsg
i work 1 day off 1 day,btohqsg
but on off day still sian,btohqsg
U need someone to call to complain,btohqsg
staying at home I became it support lmao,btohqsg
probably have quite a lot QRF in army rn,btohqsg
waiting for the button to be pressed,btohqsg
worst is those working in govt sectors,btohqsg
Idk whats worse  being extra busy or being extra slack,btohqsg
Tbh now is a good period to be a student or in NS,btohqsg
Sporeans are a bit workaholic in general  to suddenly put a pause in that,btohqsg
Student I don't think so  cause live teaching is better to learn than HBL,btohqsg
work life balance in Singapore? error 404,btohqsg
At least i had things to do when im studying for finals,btohqsg
Now all finals cancelled  its this eerie chillness,btohqsg
And cant go out which is what peeps normally do after finals,btohqsg
NS is using Zoom to teach us lessons,btohqsg
My course commander says that we can't use recording software because they're teaching restricted info,btohqsg
I rather be one of the 2,btohqsg
I'm sure they have some secret communication software,btohqsg
i just find out my old ns unit,btohqsg
Just use your phone to record it,btohqsg
now is the best time to enlist/s,btohqsg
i hope this extends into may so my bmt is canceled also 🤧🤧,btohqsg
L sia should have enlisted in april,btohqsg
faster enlist  stay home + won't delay ORD,btohqsg
ends at like 6 may or sth mine starts 12,btohqsg
I wonder if they're postponing enlistment,btohqsg
That would mean that your ORD date would get shifted,btohqsg
Be like someone and enlist last Thu/Fri,btohqsg
what's ORD when you can MR,btohqsg
Eh if BMT is postponed  POP postponed,btohqsg
We get trainee pay for a longer period of time,btohqsg
I hope your ORD dates are shifted back,btohqsg
In exchange for getting to stay home,btohqsg
I made $2000 staying at home with this one simple trick!,btohqsg
i just transfered 200$ to someone but it failed,btohqsg
and my bank acc minus 200$,btohqsg
and also cant call the bank,btohqsg
thats all i need to knw=ow,btohqsg
This happened a lot of times when i got northhill minimart,btohqsg
how long does it take uh,btohqsg
But urs is way bigger amount,btohqsg
So idk if it will take longer,btohqsg
ikr 😭I hope everything goes back to normal asap,btohqsg
meanwhile we should make good use of hbl to do smth meaningful :/,btohqsg
im just gonna chill with komm susser tod in the background,btohqsg

Permission to use this pic 🤡,btohqsg
Can’t hurt to have more smileys,btohqsg
how do I add these stickers to wa,btohqsg
You’d need the original pictures and then make your own WhatsApp sticker pack,btohqsg
Can u send me the sticker pack file if u make one,btohqsg
I’m still quite optimistic we will see the numbers go down after 2 weeks after the circuit breaker takes effect,btohqsg
Apparently the mrts and such are quite empty,btohqsg
Anyone who still havnt recieved any offer from NTU ?,btohqsg
I’m just worried about cramped spaces like foreign worker dormitories,btohqsg
It’s the perfect place for community spread,btohqsg
Ur rp above the course requirement ?,btohqsg
dk my rp a bit low like 72,btohqsg
Can uh 72 is above requirement isnt it,btohqsg
prob but ntu is my second choice uni so I don't rlly care too much bout it,btohqsg
feeling cute  shall ignore this msg,btohqsg
feeling cute  shall ignore this msg,btohqsg
HOLY SHIT WHEN DID I SAY THIS,btohqsg
Feeling cute shall path my road to hell,btohqsg
Bro u say a lot of things,btohqsg
Im pretty sure i didnt say that,btohqsg
Maybe isolation is doing things to u,btohqsg
How did I get that message then,btohqsg
Maybe u never realised u were brain fked,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwould you do a tik tok with me on zoom,btohqsg
if john smith had a tik tok acc,btohqsg

Working in a job that involves human interactionOnly to stay at home now,btohqsg
Really hits you to the bone,btohqsg
Day 2 and im alr 15% kms mode,btohqsg

Welcome back to another episode of maths with John Smith,btohqsg
Today we will be defining the 10 axioms of vectors,btohqsg
U can be his partner in crime,btohqsg
How to be chemeddy at the same time,btohqsg
U mean doing his full time career thru HBL,btohqsg
You don’t have a full time job,btohqsg
I wish for a day when jay would talk sense/coherently,btohqsg
U only make sense to urself,btohqsg
No wonder u dont have chemistry with chemistry,btohqsg
Its the practical not the theory,btohqsg
I think ur brain is more fried now,btohqsg
Ur extra finger got telekinetic abilities to make that call ?,btohqsg
Wow the streets really are empty,btohqsg
I feel like I'm walking through a ghost town,btohqsg
People are actually following the rools,btohqsg
Law lessons are making me lose braincels,btohqsg
He might be out for an essential activity,btohqsg
I ain't gonna go out in that case,btohqsg
Make sure you get clearance to fly a UAV from CAAS,btohqsg
If it was 71 it would be half!,btohqsg
Thats only if u arent planning to finish a months work in 1 day,btohqsg
I thought clearance is only needed if you fly close to state property or above a certain height?,btohqsg
Don't have to rub it in,btohqsg
You might be doing the latter,btohqsg
Today was easy tbh (for now),btohqsg
I'm not allowed to sit XD,btohqsg
Eh they close book law exams sia,btohqsg
Yeah thats why u start now,btohqsg
The wound is still slightly open HAHAHA,btohqsg
Slightly open or did you tear it,btohqsg
you could be spreading math on tik tok,btohqsg
yea plus for ntu my grades not good enough to go for the course I want to go for but for sit it's good enough I managed to get into interview stage,btohqsg
sutd is for engineering didn't want study that so I turned down the offer,btohqsg
Mainly interest  but I don't speak for everyone,btohqsg
Some people really are interested in stats,btohqsg
yea first year need study h2 bio h2 chem h2 physics though so that's another minus point for me,btohqsg
they view each of these sciences as fundamental to engineering I think then also after first year choose specialisation in one of the five pillars,btohqsg
ye apparently it's also to make sure the poly and jc students are on the same level,btohqsg
Why spread maths when can spread covid,btohqsg
they think the QE will keep the stock mkts afloat even tho the economy is screwed,btohqsg
i have a portion of my money on the side waiting,btohqsg
if it dips to 2.4 i buy,btohqsg
i oni know got opec meeting tml,btohqsg
nono its the free money ^,btohqsg
You need to be 21+ to get it,btohqsg
I gng vote not pap this election,btohqsg
Need vote out this shit gov,btohqsg

they now putting out all the stops tho,btohqsg
I get free $2100 to stay home,btohqsg
Cos they not proactive in the beginning what,btohqsg
SG waited for WHO to sound the alarm,btohqsg
That's why we were so late,btohqsg
feeling cute  shall ignore this msg,btohqsg
Get a scholarship for JC also,btohqsg
i think i had a fren who was in bv  then went ny,btohqsg

Good luck with their exam papers,btohqsg

My report book also very shit,btohqsg
My teachers in jc look down on me,btohqsg
watch yang gang launch a coup d’etat,btohqsg
With Bernie withdrawn  do they even still need to do the primary anymore? Ok i know its suspended so technically theoretically candidates can say sike I'm back  <The pedantic person  trying to guard against a pedantic attack LOL>,btohqsg
tfw people vote based on how inspiring the candidate and not based on the policies that the candidate advocate for,btohqsg
It's poetic representation of the US,btohqsg
US is in the dementic phase right now  forgot what is real freedom and democracy,btohqsg
turning into the very figure they fought against,btohqsg
we live in a society indeed,btohqsg
omg i swear the club penguin nostalgia,btohqsg
bunch of too old for club penguins ppl playing club penguin exactly like how early teens would have played it :'),btohqsg
Hi y’all  did anybody receive an SMS from NTU for NBS interview previously?,btohqsg
I saw people have been sent NBS smses alr,btohqsg
Ooooo I see. Not sure if anyone else has went for the interview yet... Cos I’m curious to know what the interviewers will ask HAHAHHA,btohqsg
My fren received admission offer from ntu today,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionhaha they may allow laptops in camp,btohqsg
Like it’s legit to play games and watch movie,btohqsg
Even green zone doesn’t allow any personal device but phone,btohqsg
Like they had a legit discussion about it,btohqsg
They alr like consider allowing FaceTime/Skype,btohqsg
Mainly that one also coz interviews probably need those,btohqsg
Yea they are discouraging people to take leave for interviews,btohqsg
They also want to remove 5BX,btohqsg
But I think everything sathia also dun like lol,btohqsg
Sathia’s rationale for not removing is coz he wants us to be awake for flag raising,btohqsg
Which is dumb coz we can’t even see the flag,btohqsg
Yea remove 5BX to decrease spread of virus,btohqsg
He’s the stereotypical tough encik who makes ur chao recroot boy into a man,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionI think ask u bring laptop is to decrease the number of gatherings due to how bored we are,btohqsg
So that u won’t pop into your friend’s room,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionoh yea last time ur breakfast when it was strictly outration did it have like 2 types?,btohqsg
Coz our breakfast dk why they pack like 2 types,btohqsg
Yesterday breakfast my bunk 2 people have noodles+pie while the other 2 had like glutinous rice+pie+custard pau,btohqsg
Then today 3 guys have pasta+small chicken+fish patty while 1 guy get croissant+cereal+fish patty lol,btohqsg
Breakfast before the social distance measures was always 2 types,btohqsg
Now it’s like u distribute also u can’t even see until u open,btohqsg
I keep getting the worse ones,btohqsg
But the croissant is very nice,btohqsg
Yea fuck BMTC one so much noodles,btohqsg

If Trump gets elected again  I'm leaving planet Earth,btohqsg

And the competition is Biden vs Trump,btohqsg
Sanders never had a chance tbh,btohqsg
Guys do you y'all know the Thanksgiving meme where the grandmother accidentally texted the wrong guy  and then invited him for food?,btohqsg
I’d take anyone who has brains over Trump,btohqsg
The smart people won't  because they'll exploit a Trump administration as hard as possible lol,btohqsg
His approval fking high now LOO,btohqsg
Not really the virus is killing a lot of the other side too LOL,btohqsg
But more elderly are going to suffer,btohqsg
Damn good job for the economy,btohqsg
So i expect he will be reelected,btohqsg
He also managed to direct the blame for the virus to china,btohqsg
I guess we will have to wait for November to find out,btohqsg
Assuming they are allowed to have an election,btohqsg
Cos biden is not a strong candidate,btohqsg
Imagine 4 more years of Trump,btohqsg
Us has like so many cases of covid now,btohqsg
Almost like Trump wants people to get infected,btohqsg
And people still wanna elect him,btohqsg
