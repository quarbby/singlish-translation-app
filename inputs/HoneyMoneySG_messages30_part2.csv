Will amaze + Crmc give 10x for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
yes  the HSBC Revolution  DBS woman‚Äôs world card  and Amaze + CRMC are few examples that will give 4mpd.,btohqsg
Why not do a master file for the 4mpd cards or we can request u to do 1 for the list of cards we have,btohqsg
Yes that is the end goal if the response is good,btohqsg
amaze + crmc or hsbc revolution? anyone tried both and have thoughts to share?,btohqsg
yeah beside these card  other cards such as OCBC Titanium card for e.g won't earn any miles/points if use to purchase air tickets?,btohqsg
a very simple theory 1 card solution would be amaze plus crmc But if u want to be more into the game and your spending is about 2k or more U can just put all your dinings in HSBC revo card The rest then chuck it in crmc IF u still have other expenses then proceed with UOB PPV For big purchases like best denki  shopee  taobao  all this throw it in OCBC Titanium card It should be more then enuff,btohqsg
hoping for one Chris. a table,btohqsg
I don't think amaze crmc apply for air tickets,btohqsg
"A video on Citi Rewards + Amaze exclusions will be published tomorrow.Hopefully this will answer all your ""what card to use"" and ""will i get 4mpd"" questions",btohqsg
Hi  noobie question  how to convert Citibank points to miles? Will Kanna any extra fee?,btohqsg
Yes. Each transfer has a fee to pay for the transfer to any airline.,btohqsg
So its best one shot transfer,btohqsg
Just curious.sdic covers up to 75k. Would you put more than 75k in foreign banks such as RHB  SC  HSBC etc...?I read somewhere not recommended,btohqsg
Ic thanks  the fee is charge to the card or deduct from the points?,btohqsg
HiA question on CPF MA.Understand that the Interest from MA will flow to OA in 2023 if we hit FRS and BHA in 2022.Does that mean that we need to build it up monthly via our job again 2023 since now we have only 66k,btohqsg
If not wrong 25$ per tranfer,btohqsg
But im not sure if transfer to kris+ and from kris+ to krisflyer is free or not,btohqsg
hi all can confirm ? For additional 1% for HSBC Revolution card  do I have to increase my EGA account balance by 2k every month ? or can just transfer in 2k and transfer out 2k immediately every month ?,btohqsg
Can go in and go out no problem,btohqsg
Your MA‚Äôs interest at the end of the year will help you grow your MA balance to new limit.,btohqsg
What you said is correct. But if you are receiving AWS or bonus in Dec ... the Jan contribution will likely top up your MA until it hits the new limit straightaway. That is why we try to do VCMA before the Jan contribution.,btohqsg
anyone here have invested in this? looking for true review after being talked to by bank consultant,btohqsg
Will they prompt you once you have met the requirements for the additional 1%?,btohqsg
Hi there! Anyone know amex card able to pay Manulife premium?,btohqsg
My interest didnt go back to MA after being moved to OA. So it kind of resetted to 66k.,btohqsg
My contribution was done in dec so now i got to slowly build up again.  my initial understanding was the interest will moved back to MA so that i do not need to worry about the BHS increase. So im wrong until i check recently that my MA is below BHS,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a prudential senior agent. My advise is if you can invest in yourself. Do it yourself.,btohqsg
2ndly. If u really want to go for it. U better find an agent. And don‚Äôt go with bank. Because u won‚Äôt get the after service if you want to switch portfolios,btohqsg
The problem with insurance agent also the same. They don't service the client after 3 years becos no more commission. So  everything still have to do ourself,btohqsg
When call the agent  they will say busy when they heard that no potential income.,btohqsg
So  whether bank or insurance agent. Is the same,btohqsg
You must really have a bad one bro ..,btohqsg
That agent that I know. Have been with him for 20+ years,btohqsg
Well. That‚Äôs another story to tell. Anyway @jsn you have your answers ya,btohqsg
Hi yup  thanks alot for all these infos,btohqsg
Will think about it and find a way to work it out,btohqsg
