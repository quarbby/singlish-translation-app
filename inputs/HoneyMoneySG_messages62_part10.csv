CIMB savings account promo for me,btohqsg
I applied UOB Preferred Platinum visa and get rejected. Kind of surprised because I already have other cards UOB one and Lady's Solitaire. These cards share the same credit limit  so no legible reason to get rejected. I have UOB ONE acct. My credit rating AA. I am trying to decipher the reason. Anyone have same experience?,btohqsg
UOB work in unknown ways. I also got rejected for Ladys Card for awhile when i already have UOB PPV VS and PRVI,btohqsg
We shouldn't apply so many credit cards. It'll damage our credit scores,btohqsg
Has anyone lost access to your POSB cashback bonus ‚Äúbank & earn summary‚Äù page? I keep getting an error message that the service is not available,btohqsg
Hello you do your own business?,btohqsg
Hmm I don't think so.. Depends how and when you applied. As long you paid on time. I usually even paid in full before my credit statement is out.,btohqsg
Ah okay. I always pay on time. Just to check  by full so you mean the due amount for that month or the total amount?,btohqsg
For the credit score purpose and avoid interest  Full for that statement month. But for my own practice  if the total amount is not a lot of difference  I paid all.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt full for the statement month just the due amount?,btohqsg
This comment is true if you apply too many consecutively.e.g. apply UOB  CIMB  DBS  SCB all in one month. Deemed as desperate borrower.However  if you applyJanuary UOBMarch CIMBMay DBSJuly SCBno issue one.,btohqsg
Ah okay. Didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Full statement month  not min DUE. You will be charged with interest if you only pay min due.,btohqsg
Oh okay. SC can be quite confusing. Their ‚Äúdue amount‚Äù is actually their full statement month,btohqsg
Anyone here work in bank mortgage departments? Does it matter if the credit rating is bad  but with perfect payment history? This is my concern.,btohqsg
For UOB lady‚Äôs  6mpd for every $5  does it mean that I only get 6 miles for $9.95 purchase? Whereas for HSBC Revo I get 9X4= 36 miles for the same purchase?,btohqsg
0.4mpd (1x point) based on $5 blocks per transaction3.6mpd (9x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5√ó9)2mpd (5x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5√ó5),btohqsg
As found in a previous message sent here,btohqsg
If i use 100x $4.99 transactions  no points?,btohqsg
$5 x 6 miles = 30 miles,btohqsg
So actually for low purchase not worthwhile using uob,btohqsg
assuming all your 4.99 txns belong to your selected bonus category for uob lady's  you'll get 5.6mpd*495,btohqsg
For SimplyGo  bus and mrt  it is calculated per trip or per month?,btohqsg
Uob lady's is $5 block rite?,btohqsg
the example was 100x transactions  so total would be $499,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 5 block but milelion state that they will add everything together at the end of every statement. ( I think )So if u spend 999 it would be rounded down to 995 and u get the miles for 995,btohqsg
Hi all  I have DBS altitude and yuu card. Will my DBS point gone if I cancel DBS altitude card?Tried applying for fee waiver but always got rejected...,btohqsg
"Managed to get the CSO  she mentioned ""internal credit requirement"" without further detail when I pressed further. With your experience and mine  I can infer that UOB allows us only max get 2 credit cards.",btohqsg
they approved my solitare afterawhile. Now i have 5 UOB cards,btohqsg
Ah OK.. In that case  may be need to wait a bit. My lady's only close to 2 months,btohqsg
Yes you are right.. The bonus 9X is calculated at the end as total.. But we don't get the base point 1 X,btohqsg
To put it simply for uob lady's  below $5 transactions1x points: don't have (0.4 mpd)9x points: have  3.6 mpd5x points: have  till 29 feb 2024  2.0 mpdNet 5.6 mpd,btohqsg

Most credit cards need have a minimum income requirement,btohqsg
Earn your income first. Use debit card for online transaction.,btohqsg

Hi.. How do I use amex pay to pay at hawker. The finger print always got rejected after I scanned the QR. What is the pin number to unlock it?,btohqsg
Did you try calling the dbs credit card Hotline to speak to cso? If really have to cancel then spend all your dbs points first before cancelling.,btohqsg
What people usually buy things with a credit card?,btohqsg
That debit card cannot? And why use credit card,btohqsg

Other apps are ok wit finger print,btohqsg
AMEX pay not using your card pin?,btohqsg
I dun remember I set any card pin.. Is it the front of the card. Or the unlock phone pin?,btohqsg
They just wanna verify if u're the actual owner of the phone,btohqsg
