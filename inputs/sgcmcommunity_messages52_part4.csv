That's cool  but it will be flawed cos it refers to the rules,btohqsg
Lol KWs..not surprised if most are not drivers,btohqsg
Ya seriously. i unfollowed sgrv for a long time. I had to take blood pressure mediciation for it.,btohqsg
Kidding but also not kidding lol.,btohqsg
all driver cfm road hog the right lane 10kmh below speed limit,btohqsg
Lol dun get yourself angry over these comments,btohqsg
"then ppl overtake on the left then ""WOI FASTER GET CAN FOOTAGE POST ONROAD.SG!!""",btohqsg
"By right C because in the highway code ""slow down when approaching a roundabout  and give way to traffic on your right.""",btohqsg
Hahaha sometimes just to get my heart pumping at the start of the day,btohqsg
idk u see ppl get injured and shit... when cyclist get into accidents and see ppl cheering even if they unfortunately pass away... still got ppl cheering,btohqsg
But again.. hard to say.. Maybe b never signal? *Shrug*,btohqsg
No  this cannot apply here. Give way to the right is to give way to those inside the roundabout  before u enter the roundbout.,btohqsg
If that applies  C must stop to let B exit? It will be mayhe.,btohqsg
Ah cos there's a ongoing flow and slowing down suddenly or brake would risk an accident,btohqsg
Yes  and its confusing. If im driving on the outer lane  i need to check whether car on my right is exiting or not  or which entrance he came in from  and make a calculated guess which exit he exiting,btohqsg
Yeah still roundabout need not have to be fast. In-fact suntec round about makes it worst cause there is even more tower pickup and drop off point turning in,btohqsg
Sg nt alot roundabout. Alot driver nt familiar on how to navigate one,btohqsg
Even this is not correct. In my opinion,btohqsg
Strangely enough  UK has tons of them and they do it quite well. Their highway code very detailed and really you have to give way to vehicles on your right one.In the end  cars  should give way to  vehicles on the right one even on round abouts.,btohqsg
Car C can go straight and bang B,btohqsg
Must give way  this is as good as a right turn,btohqsg
The whole important principle here is give way.,btohqsg
You must stop for cars joining the roundabout,btohqsg
Rather than the other way around,btohqsg
To put it simply  its organised chaos,btohqsg
Yes must give way  but before u enter roundabout,btohqsg
But i know what u mean  if C saw B coming  he should not enter and go straight,btohqsg
Or just close eyes and pray,btohqsg
roundabout is all about common sense... need to give way just give way...,btohqsg
Ok i have given it more indepth thought about this.For the 2 lane roundabout  A and B can exit at 12 o'clock because it is somewhat like a go straight lane. A must exit by 12 o'clock.And while C can enter from 9 o'clock and exit at 3 o'clock  there shouldn't be a point in time that he is beside B or collide with B  because C should wait for B to pass before entering or enter earlier before B approaches  which allows C to exit at 3 o'clock without any danger.Technically everyone one should be driving at the same low speed.Perhaps im not as good at driving as i thought i am. Now i got to eat my own words. Sorry for the long post!,btohqsg
the inside circle only for you to go around for 5 mins while you brush your teeth and  wear your socks,btohqsg
Hiya guys has anyone used tourador tyres before haha been seeing alot of cars with the decal,btohqsg
What do u expect frm a 50-60$ tyre bro. If u use for short mileage just point a and b e everyday kind and change on regular interval i think ok lah.,btohqsg
If you value your life  dont use it.,btohqsg
Nowadays the weather is dogshit  rain a shit ton. This kinda tyres tend to aqua plane alot.,btohqsg
only use tourador if you wanna go gymkhana,btohqsg
I've seen a maserati and a mustang 2.3 with tourador tyres lol,btohqsg
that's a pretty savage way of sending your message acrossðŸ˜³-R,btohqsg
Tyres are one of the most important things on your car. Would not recommend them. Might save you a quick buck but can cost you your life  wet grip very poor and grip in general sub par. Can be a major issue in the wet or emergency braking,btohqsg
sounds way better in an australian accent,btohqsg
But unfortunately  the blocked words on this chat won't allow you to use it,btohqsg
Must not be happy with life if we follow@Jingxunn's advice,btohqsg
aiya legit damn funny esp cos they rwd,btohqsg
spent too much paying loan for car everymonth. not much left for tyres...,btohqsg
What so bad about the tourandor tyre,btohqsg
I see a lot of ppl pasting the sticker and it does look nice,btohqsg
Your Tesla become mustang leaving car meet if you try,btohqsg
Yeah was just thinking whats the grip and all that  not tyre expert at all but seen quite a lot with them,btohqsg
Smart marketing. I think $10 off per tyre if u have the sticker. So that quite a lot of discount on a tyre that is already very affordable,btohqsg
Yeah  i mean i dont really speed or anything  so was thinking like dun rly need performance tyre like michelin/conti etc  but if tourador cant get a basic safe grip in most ppl experience then thats definitely a problem imo haha,btohqsg
