Rev limiters exist for a reason,btohqsg
Once in awhile for feels ok  but everday is just asking for it,btohqsg
Then still okay  unless it‚Äôs cold.,btohqsg

Sky Not peteüòÇüòÇ if advice good he listen one,btohqsg
Better be upfront now than I spoil my GB and fork out 9k,btohqsg
You whack into neutral in 4th gear  you‚Äôre putting yourself in danger.Being in neutral at speed means your engine has no load and you can‚Äôt just expect your DSG to pick a gear and go where you left off. That few seconds where you have no engine power  if something goes wrong  you‚Äôre mega foxed.Also  that would be bad for the GB.,btohqsg
Please don‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôve had knob heads do that on highways and end up killing themselves because they have no engine power when they need it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Now sports car very common on the road sia,btohqsg
I say this not to call you irresponsible or stupid  but it‚Äôs a stupid thing to do. Your life is worth more than that,btohqsg
I shall take care of my GB now,btohqsg
Although I think it‚Äôs at the end of lifespan soon anyway,btohqsg
I tot Pete usually this hr very active 1,btohqsg
Revving with the limiter also fun mah,btohqsg
Heard Audi GB MU last only 45k-60k,btohqsg
Yes  but ehh might be voided,btohqsg
I read the warranty clause  if I drive for PHV it might be voided,btohqsg
