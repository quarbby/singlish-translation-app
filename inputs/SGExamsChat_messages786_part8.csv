by right Thinkpad should give error sound  if not is mother board totally gone,btohqsg
but it was ok just now right? So you might be right water is in,btohqsg
if u know how to open the laptop  open it  dry the water inside  use a fan and blow on it for 8 hours at least,btohqsg
opening it a bit harder  nowadays they don't use screws. So it's like sliding a card at the sides to open it. You might break some parts in the process but no choice.,btohqsg
can search youtube for your model,btohqsg
this one is irreparable liao right ðŸ’€,btohqsg
even better  just open  likely a drop of water or two that is causing shorts on some circuitry.,btohqsg
but don't on it again for today,btohqsg
use a fan blow on it,btohqsg
highest likelihood is water went from bottom of laptop. The keyboard at the top is anti-water,btohqsg
