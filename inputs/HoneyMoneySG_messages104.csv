Any ideaSyfe Income+is safe? Does it affect my capital?,btohqsg
Uob absolute cannot amex pay right? 😭,btohqsg
Weird haha. Because both GOMO and ZYM also using the same Singtel's network. If you say difference between Singtel and GOMO/ZYM still possible since only they only allow their main clients to run on their 5G SA networks  while subsidiaries and MVNO is only 5G NSA. Either way the coverage are pretty similar also.,btohqsg
Any guys applied for lady’s saving acc today? Must we select lady’s card to come with it? Because I already had solitaire so don’t really want another card,btohqsg
I doubt they will decommission but I foresee fees like 1% per transaction  with minimum fee. Then alternative is AMEX Pay already.,btohqsg
Common for a lot of cards. It's bin dumping  so those systems will repeatedly try to perform fraudulent transactions.,btohqsg
Correct. You still get instarem points.,btohqsg
Lady’s credit or debit card? Credit you cannot get since you already have Lady’s Solitaire. Debit card I doubt you can unselect,btohqsg
Thanks  so no choice have to take a new debit card that’s comes with the saving acc,btohqsg
Just take and go UOB chat assist to tell them to not deliver the card. It worked for UOB One debit card  so I guess it'll work for UOB Lady's debit card.,btohqsg
The only safe place is in saving accounts where it is SDIC insured.,btohqsg
Can use shopback pay for hawker food. No many out there though...,btohqsg
"Hi guys. I am trying to use citi payall for insurance payment. However the policy number got alphabets in it. But the citi app only allows numbers to be input in the ""Policy number"". Anyone know of a workaround for this?",btohqsg
I think insurance company can still track with just the number,btohqsg
Those want to sign up to UOB new user promo. Think again.,btohqsg
Spoke to UOB few week back. They also said they have issue with Mastercard causing new card user unable to link card to online vendors or even make online purchases (example  amazon  shopee  nike  amaze  atome  etc). Stupid for such a big company to have such issue going on for weeks. Till today I return from Business Trip but still cannot use Amaze+UOB or even pay my bills online. Think can forget about triggering the $1k spend per month to get the cashback already.Update 29 April: Just spoke to their cs and UOB is becoming really thrash. Basically still have some online vendors have ongoing issues. Long story short. Ownself settle with vendors for alternative payment. Those chasing new to card rewards. Their responds  just too bad. I am going to cancelled my lady’s card with UOB immediately.,btohqsg
Ya been having issue with uob and atome. Their loss lor. I’ll just use different card.,btohqsg
how come new cards not working?,btohqsg
Not new cards  even existing cards as well. Especially when trying to link to amaze or other services.,btohqsg
"yeah agree. so it doesnt make much sense. and i purposely choose Gomo to ""back test""",btohqsg
i just used it yesterday though  no issues for me,btohqsg
Any card give reward for road tax payment?,btohqsg
You can unlink and try relink.. 🤪,btohqsg
"You can try searching ""road tax card""",btohqsg
Thanks  search already  can’t find any credit card that come with rewards,btohqsg
It have been ask and reply quite a number of time already and there is card that give reward for road tax,btohqsg
Hi everyone  if i am moving all my funds from UOB One to OCBC 360 from the start of May (leaving only enough in UOB to avoid fall below fee)  what day/time is best to transfer my funds to ensure best interest based on MAB (Do i transfer on 30 apr 10pm)?Or no difference and i will miss 1 day of interest no matter what since 1 May is PH.,btohqsg
If u plan to shift entire just do on 30 apr,btohqsg
If my average daily balance is 105k in March  do I need to maintain an average balance of 155k for duration of May for the UOB savings promo or can stick with just 150k average after 1 May?,btohqsg
thanks! so 155k for the month of May only right? 😊,btohqsg
Accordingly to other yes  according to uob is must maintain throughout,btohqsg
Even if use FAST deposit on 1 May will still reflect as 2 May ah?,btohqsg
Any mastercard that has unlimited cash rebate regardless of type of spending? Doesnt matter if it is a low %.,btohqsg
Citi cashback plus 1.6 percent (of course have exclusion list),btohqsg
standard exclusions will apply - e.g. Insurance,btohqsg
So only amex have unlimited cashback with no exclusion? Not a single mastercard have that? Have been finding for years alone.. Now finally have such a group to confirm and concur 😂,btohqsg
Last card standing would be amex true cashback  anymore nerf would be none liao,btohqsg
They signed a tie up with parkway hospital group for 5years starting 2021. Short term wise shouldnt have any nerf for this. Am exploring more options. Seems dont have.,btohqsg
amex also exclude insurance unless buy amex chubb insurance,btohqsg
Oh.. Thought true cashback has no exclusion.. Seems i am wrong then..,btohqsg
no such exclusion for Amex True cashback,btohqsg
I think only exclude grab and spc haha,btohqsg
Thats what i thought and previously confirmed. Thought there was a new update that i was unaware of..,btohqsg
Dont underestimate cc churner if there is indeed a 100 percent non exclusion card,btohqsg
may I ask  for the current Webull promo to deposit USD500 and complete 1 buy trade  is it possible to subscribe to cash fund and be eligible?,btohqsg
They exclude still got 0.3% cashback also not bad liao haha,btohqsg

TCB includes insurance  SPC and Grab charged direct to card. Wallet top ups and balance transfer excluded.,btohqsg
Hi  I'm trying to hit UOB minimum spending of $500. Does buying ecapita voucher from the app work?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I just watched the timely video from Chris for 120k annual req. cc but still don’t have a conclusion yet…I’m looking to sign one up in May for overflowing expenses that cannot be covered by crmc and UOB Lady solitaires (upcoming BTO need new electrical/appliances/furnitures). Which CC should I get? Considering between DBS vantage  Citi prestige and UOB VI. If perks is a lesser consideration  my choices should just be based on annual fee  sign on bonus and local spend MPD?,btohqsg
Anyone has suggestions for miles card to use for petrol? My citi rewards is capped for other stuff hence require an alternative,btohqsg
is it true that standard chartered journey card cannot get miles for hospital payment?,btohqsg
Use Wogi as in app considered as wallet top up.,btohqsg
Private hospitals can  not too sure about public,btohqsg
can get miles for hospital mcc,btohqsg
Ya I thought so for public hosp too  but the live chat CSO say no SC cards can get points cuz hospital mcc excluded .,btohqsg
Looks like XNAP office is shut down.,btohqsg
Wow then if xnap is up lorryWhat's else app to use for hawker,btohqsg
In general  How long does it take  to receive the promotion gifts for credit cards ?,btohqsg
Is Anytime Fitness considered as an Online Spend? Would like to use DBS Woman's Credit Card for it.,btohqsg
Recurring giro ? I dare not risk 😂😂😂I pay at counter every month for my Fitness First,btohqsg
U sure they give reward lol? Spc only if u join the spc offer no base 1.5  neither is grab top up,btohqsg
I don't think there is anymore,btohqsg
Anyone knows the interest checker for UOB. I’ve spent over >$500 in both my evol and one card (some charges are still pending)   but the interest checker is still not updated yet and it’s almost end month. Does the 500min spend only counts if it’s processed and reflected in the interest checker?,btohqsg
Is your transaction all eligible spend,btohqsg
All is paywave/apple wave. Never used the physical card. Should be eligible?,btohqsg
provided mcc/merchant not excluded. The tracker updates 1 day after transactions are posted. Only eligible transactions posted by 30 Apr count to the $500,btohqsg
All right  will check once it’s updated later since the last update was on 27th. Thank you! Checked the exclusions and my transactions and looks all fine.,btohqsg
was trying to search the chat for 120k CC suggestions  must have mis clicked,btohqsg
Yea i watched that video. Seems like best mpd is DBS Vantage atm  and i read elsewhere on reddit. to just rotate between these cards for sign on bonuses,btohqsg
Hi  my uob ONE account is earmarked $100k for the rising dragon promo. I still can top up another 50k to get the 4% right?,btohqsg
u need to register ur interest.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
If it's still earmarked  you might not be able to do it on the same account. You can still try to register.,btohqsg
hi all   hope to have  some advise.  is it good to invest in US bonds Funds as i m a passive investor ?,btohqsg
For the usual 4% still can get right? Cos i dont want to earmark the 50k.,btohqsg
Whats the benefit of using Amex pay? Can you link other bank cards to earn miles/points from hawker centre/coffee shops?,btohqsg
Anyone here close their HSBC EGA account? Need to go down to branch or can do over the chat?,btohqsg
hello! does anybody happen to know if buying giant grocery vouchers still count towards the $600 qualified spending under yuu?,btohqsg
You need to also consider a) do u use another miles card currently b) your travel habits are 2 pax or more c) do u foresee using the 4th night perks from your travel.,btohqsg
The app tells you how to do it in their support tab,btohqsg
A) using crmc+ amaze  and UOB solitaires for my miles spendingB) travelling with spouse most of the timeC) doubt it… haven’t experienced or see the need of this upside as of yet,btohqsg
next month HSBC is the highest interest?,btohqsg
No idea yet  no new from hsbc yet,btohqsg
hi  for existing uob customer. Do you open UOB lady account for the extra mpd? is account opening instant or need to wait?,btohqsg
If you have the lady's solitaire card and you know you will spend 2k that month  then it's worth to put in 10k for the extra 2 mpd. Summarised version.,btohqsg
I just chat with UOB CSO  she said we can still participate thisUOB Big Savings Payout Promotionalthough we hv participated the Rising Dragon Promo..Because the additional 50k top up on top of the existing earmarked 100k is  fresh fund.. so we can participate the 50k to get $250,btohqsg
I would trust the t&c more than UOB's CSO but go ahead and try. At most don't get the $250  still can get 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Let me read the t&c again,btohqsg
Hi  if I use my cc to pay for shopback qr in restaurants  can i stack both cashback and cc cashback?,btohqsg
Hey guys...anyone know whats the minimum spend for the citi rewards card?,btohqsg
There is no min spend card to be reward ~You are rewarded 4mpdAnd it rounded down to nearest $,btohqsg
And if i use the card frequently paired with instarem amaze- do i need to pay the annual fee?,btohqsg
To me  I prefer one card not just before of the shopee and grab etc. But I don't need to headache to be particular of what type of transaction you spending in view of the max cap. For one card  if you exceeded 500  you can always go for higher tier. I am much happier with the flexibility after changing from dbs live fresh to one card. One card if you can bear with interest rate qualifying criteria is to make eligible spend of min 500 for 3 months,btohqsg
You have to go higher tier for the whole quarter though. So it’s not really very flexible,btohqsg
Only TCB gives 1.5% rebate for SPC after 7.1% promo as tested  other Amex cards excluded.Input and save Amex card number to Grab directly earns rewards  all top ups excluded.,btohqsg
Yes agree. I also been using the one card but tempted to switch to EVOL as the cash rebates are much higher. I usually just clock 500ish on one card only though. Once i hit 500ish  i use another card to clock.,btohqsg
Hi  guys. I saw there is a dcs logo on some sgqr code  can I ask if I can pay with dcs app from dcs credit card? I would like to apply one dcs card if so😂,btohqsg
Hello  may I ask if I were to withdraw all my funds from UOB now.. will I still get my bonus interest on the 2nd?,btohqsg
Oh great. So I can withdraw everything now ya?,btohqsg
No qualification? Later he expect full 5% pa woh.,btohqsg
Depends on how much interest you want to get based on your MAB in Apr. If you withdraw now  you will lose interest $21.37 calculated based on 7.8% pa if you have $100k between 1-29 April.,btohqsg
When should I withdraw to get the full 5%? Is it before 10.30pm or after 10.30pm on 30/4/24?Currently I have 3 UOB one account under different family member each $100k. 1 of UOB one need to withdraw to top up 50k to the other 2 UOB one. Please advise. Thanks,btohqsg
Too late Liao.The right way is to make it such that account A withdraw till $1000 on 30th April will still have $100 000 mab.,btohqsg
Lol you should have asked this a month ago.If you don't intend to register for earmark for the other 2 accounts then transfer after 1030pm for all 3 to get 5% p.a. You'll also won't get full 4% p.a. unless you keep it at 151.7k until end of May.If you don't mind losing some interest for that 1 account  then transfer before 1030pm. You can make it up with the full 4% p.a. for the 2 accounts and cash credits from earmark promo.,btohqsg
Oh no  too late. So what should i do now 😭😭,btohqsg
Yes i am ok losing some interest for 1 of the account to get full 4% for the 2 accounts  but the cash credits promo only base on 50k top up which is $250 😭  right?,btohqsg
Yes. I just realised there is at cash credit promo. Too late now to get the $1k right?Or can i try to join in may end withdraw all n put back $150k?,btohqsg
Can i open new uob one account under another person name n put  my 150k in that new acc n join this cash credit tomorrow to get 1k?,btohqsg
how to reach out to standard chartered credit card support? is there any chat option?,btohqsg
"""Tomorrow"" refers to today right? It's 30 Apr",btohqsg
Yes i mean 30/4. Can i do that?,btohqsg
If the account opens by today and the promo registration goes through then sure. But remember to reoptimise the rest of the money,btohqsg
Ok thanks for all the useful info.I will try to go to UOB tomorrow then 👍🏻,btohqsg
Hi all! Would like to ask if we should sign up OCBC 360 account for the high interest rate?,btohqsg

Wah lao xnap down for so long,btohqsg
Hi  for the UOB one 4% interest rate at the 150k tier - do I top up the additional 50k (from the current 100k MAB) today or tomorrow? Since it is a PH tomorrow?,btohqsg
It has been delisted from Google app store already. Hope still can use after they have resolved the issues,btohqsg
The Big savings payout promo until 29 june  I am not sure if I can make it to open new account by another family member n join the Big savings promo by today.If cannot make it just put the $150k in a new account  before end of may can I transfer all back to my account as new fresh fund n join the promo?,btohqsg
UOB Big saving promo  anyone knows whether the earmarked funds can be withdraw in times of emergency ? or is it locked up like fixed deposit?,btohqsg
new fund is incremental balance above Mar MAB deposited from another bank,btohqsg
can request UOB to unlock but then the cashback will be forfeited,btohqsg
If from different account name  how do they check?,btohqsg
OCBC Rewards vs OCBC 90N | Best Miles Credit Card for OCBC 360https://youtu.be/oKi0RHeeMO4,btohqsg

Are u certain that they don’t count during PH? Doesn’t seem like need human intervention on the bank side.,btohqsg
transaction on 1 May will be dated 2 May,btohqsg
yes but FAST transfer on 1 May is dated 2 May although receive funds immediately,btohqsg
unable to see chat option in this screen  can anyone else see? i want to reach out to standchart... unable to do so,btohqsg
anyone ? I can top it up to the amount such that the mab in may is 150K but I can still partake and earmarked the 50K in May right ?,btohqsg

to get $150k mab in may either have $150k on 30 Apr or $155k from 1may/2May  might as well register for the promo now and deposit today by 10.30pm,btohqsg
I did…. So far so good,btohqsg
If you cannot open the new account by today  you can always register the new account for the promo in May for earmarking in Jun with 150k.Are you referring to the account with 100k already? If you can register with the new account  no point to register with your account for less.,btohqsg
If you don't mind returning the cash credit  you can call in the request withdrawal.,btohqsg
Yes immediate  on the business day. Else the following business day  with the funds available immediately.,btohqsg
Good day gurus  just saw this criteria in cpf life basic plan  but no clear indication under what conditions will deduct 10%? Or under what conditions will deduct 20%?Please advise if you have more insights to this aspects  thanks2,btohqsg
Oh look there's a number on the website available to call,btohqsg
So far … yesThough i put in for 2 weeks only 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Yep but from my side  funds will be in early may for top up. So as long as i am able to attain 150K for the MAB in May  i can earmarked once my funds are in early may and still get 4.5% ?,btohqsg
Considering your MAB in Mar is 97k  register for 50ktoday  and top-up till 150ktoday. By today I mean ASAP. Don't be JIT warrior.,btohqsg
But my funds 50K+ will only be available in 8 May …,btohqsg
Is not a deliberate attempt to time..,btohqsg
Hahaha.. which fund u subscribe yea? Sgd fund? Can I also check if I can deposit and subscribe 60k of fund on the same day?,btohqsg
You can still register in May for Jun earmarking.If you cannot meet MAB of 150k  then you will lose out on the bonus interest  unless you can top-up enough funds to bring up 150k from 8 May.,btohqsg
Yes… sgd fund… fullertonBut my promo looks different from yours 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Hi all  if my funds are already earmarked under the rising dragon promo and will be released in mid-May  can I still register for the big savings promo today and fund in extra 50k for earmark in mid May? Or do i have to wait till my earmarked funds are released under rising dragon before i can take part in big savings payout? Thank you!,btohqsg
You can try register and fund today. At most you register again in end May if they never earmark.,btohqsg
I am asking that if transfer from UOB one acc A to another UOB one acc B (UOB one account under different name) the 150k consider fresh fund?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for scb acct  do I need to wait till interest credited then only transfer out the money? Or I can do the transfer on 1/5 w/o having impact on apr’s interest?,btohqsg
The B account is going to be new account which i will open todayMeaning zero MAB.So the new acc entitle to this Big Promo right?,btohqsg
By letter of T&C  is not considered fresh funds. In practice  possibly a different story,btohqsg
That is why i ask how do they check if i withdraw from A acc to put into new UOB one under B name,btohqsg
How would we know here 😂 if you feel okay to take the risk go ahead,btohqsg
If you want to hit the 150k MAB  you need to have 165.5k from 8 May onwards,btohqsg
As if we are UOB CSO 😂,btohqsg
I thought you said transfer back to own account? And no guarantees if they count even if different names 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
why risk it if can easily transfer to another bank before transfer to uob?,btohqsg
He isn’t asking UOB CSO via call or UOB chat  he is asking product managers in this group 😂,btohqsg
Sadly their CSO less accurate than this group chat 🤣,btohqsg
Thanks. Yep I did my calculations on the side 💜,btohqsg
Anyway if the transaction is UOB account on both ends it’s super easy for them to track if they wanted to. Cos they can easily verify on the transaction request info that both sending and receiving account is under themselves.,btohqsg
One will say can  one will say cannot because same bank  another will say cannot even if different bank but same name 🤡Jussajoke,btohqsg
Good morning   webull January moneybull 100k usd promo  anyone received the $3000 usd cash voucher alr ?,btohqsg

I’m mean use which physical card better,btohqsg
Is the top up for train fare using UOB evol card counted for the 600 spending?,btohqsg
Yes if u trust the person enough,btohqsg
Use computer. All they need is just 1 second of computer times to auto check if you are qualified. You don’t expect they use eyeball to read thru hundreds thousands of customer’s accounts  right?,btohqsg
The definition of fresh fund is the tnc very clearly. So if you attempt to transfer from another UOB account and it doesn’t work. Please do not ask us why it doesn’t work. You want rewards  you need to work for it.,btohqsg
Rewards $2920 USD will credited by 7th May if fulfill TnC.,btohqsg
Uob a to uob b not fresh fund  u must go thru external channel,btohqsg
Hi all  if I plan to use amaze X Citi rewards overseas. Do I need to enable both cards for overseas use or just the amaze alone will do?,btohqsg
I transfer from my UOB one to my DBS than to UOB new account under different name  can?Or withdraw cash from A uob one  deposit to B uob one,btohqsg
Any name also can as long as external channel. U want to deposit cash also can,btohqsg
Amaze alone   on Citi side it will be seen as local company charged in SGD,btohqsg
I mean if someone has done it before here  may be can share their experience. I am newbie here 😀,btohqsg
Because the t&c stated very clearly what is considered and what is not considered fresh funds. Most will assume you have read and understand the basic info presented in the t&c before clarifying on the strategy.,btohqsg
Hello allMay I see guidance on 2 topics1. which card most suitable to pay for schoolfee   govt tax   insurance  etcWith services like cardup to gain maximum benefit of miles ?2. Citi rewards + Instarem Amaze still good for primary card (local spending ) excluding travels ?,btohqsg

Beside spc petrol using physical card will post immediate  any other purchase for same day posting for the UOB One?.,btohqsg
For your use card ocbc titanium or uob ppv is better,btohqsg
ppv = privmiles? i have this card already. im trying to see if my habit. does lady card 4mpd give me any benefit.. i dun mind the 1k :),btohqsg
the card only give bonus points if the MCC is under ur selected category. Doesn't matter online or not. As MCC of lazada/shopee varies  it is not the best card to use.,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
no ppv is preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
If you read a few post earlier  their office also closed. Doesn't sounds encouraging..,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for those calculating the UOB One account daily average balance  any excel gurus has worked out the excel formula? Do share here or if inconvenient  can pm me please.I’m currently at $100k and would take some time before I accumulate to $150k. The EIR for my DAB would likely be 3.xx% for the current account balance. Checking if alternative investments are better in the mean time. Thanks!,btohqsg
Formula is simple  I know you can work it out  Little champ!,btohqsg
The best excel formula is to maintain the daily account balance the same throughout the whole month. Any transaction credited in shall be transferred out within same day before 6pm.1).No Giro  no Paynow link   no other petty amount transaction.2). Salary n interest credited in shall be transferred out within same day before 6pm.Hassle free “excel formula”. Enjoy.,btohqsg

Why will you want to transfer OA to SRS even if it is allowed? Interest rate for SRS is so low compared to OA.,btohqsg
Okay because I want to try Saving bond which only accept Cash or SRS. So wonder if can use OA to SRS.,btohqsg

They sent me an SMS to verify a transaction. When they didn't receive a reply  they automatically decline the transaction and suspend my card. All these happened at around 4am. So not bad...expect for the fact that somehow their cards are particularly vulnerable to scams?,btohqsg
You can use 100k for Maribank and 100k for GXS bank,btohqsg
Touch wood but my Citi cc didn't kenna,btohqsg
Hopefully...this is my 2nd time. The 1st merchant requires a OTP/verification so it did not go through and the CSO just told me ignore it and that they will report it to their relevant department.,btohqsg
I replace alot of time liao till i lost count,btohqsg
If people do search first they would have found the answer before they asked,btohqsg
👍But I see repeated questions :)So am thinking save ur time,btohqsg
🤔 So where is the source of the leak? Citi themselves?,btohqsg
Yeah if they searched first there wouldn't be repeated questions,btohqsg
Some ppl say brute force the bin number,btohqsg
Put on pinnedFAQ - refer to FAQCopy and paste,btohqsg
Looks likely xnap done deal Liao up lorry,btohqsg
Unfortunately not everyone has GXS Bank account.. so alternatively if@nil_sgpcan find a trusted person to open maribank can put 100k each for 2.88% p.a.,btohqsg
I guess you can say they have xnapped out,btohqsg
You need to be Malaysian in order to apply,btohqsg
Ya amex pay the last bastion last stand,btohqsg
At least amex wont fold up haha,btohqsg
Hi all  will it be better to tsf 55k to UOB ONE account on 2 May instead? Cos if tsf tonight then i will be losing interest in other banks and earning a low interest rate on 30 April for the 50k that i topped up. Please advise,btohqsg
can if the numbers work out for u,btohqsg
If you not registering for promo in Apr it'll work out for MAB in May.,btohqsg
I decided to register for the big savings payout promo. If top up 55k on 2 May still okay?,btohqsg
Register in apr fund have to be in apr  if u want to bring in may then register again in may,btohqsg
I think Apr registration  but funds in is up to end May,btohqsg
Need to be in same month as u register,btohqsg
U dont believe u reg apr then pump in may loh,btohqsg
I did today. I'm just referring to the image from UOB,btohqsg
You show this but you say up to end May. Contradicting,btohqsg
Cos still think the 4% is worthwhile,btohqsg
Isn't the centre column says end May?,btohqsg
The column say earmark by may not deposit by may,btohqsg
That’s the earmark and cash credit date   depositing date is 30th April,btohqsg
I think people really need to read carefully and fully comprehend the tnc,btohqsg
I think they need English tuition,btohqsg
U cant fix brain with tution  it is habit  my friend fast read or dont read all the time,btohqsg
You can fix the comprehension of their english,btohqsg
Understanding is a process that can be sharpen but it cant be done if people dont think it need to be improve lol,btohqsg
I opt for cash + portfolio still show pending approval since Saturday,btohqsg
You just contradicted yourself here when you sent the picture of the t&c,btohqsg
I did too  started on Saturday deposit on Saturday  alrd invested,btohqsg
Wow that’s so weird how come,btohqsg
Cash credit is from UOB  not our deposit,btohqsg
"I submitted the form ystd. But i want to pump in in May. So the second form will over ride?There is an illustration example in the tnc but im still confused. It states ""last participation form submitted within the earliest qualifying period""",btohqsg
if Average balance mar is 100900 can top up 50k? or must more?,btohqsg
Yes. Your first registration earmarking will fail already so you have to submit again.,btohqsg
Yes  unfortunately I don’t have GXS bank account and not sure how complex is to open one. Tnx for the suggestion,btohqsg
do you know what is the criteria ?,btohqsg
Last time grab platinum user used to get the invite faster,btohqsg
Once I press top up  it does not allow me to- says pending approval,btohqsg
Maybe it’s missing information or just take some time to,btohqsg
GXS is by invite all along? Or is it a recent thing?,btohqsg
Ohhh don’t rmb I had an invite,btohqsg
They notified through email and grab app.,btohqsg
Ohhh probably back then when the card was good,btohqsg
@kelvintaninvestwah look this guy trying to impersonate you sia HAHA,btohqsg
I went down to the branch personally and i was told the same,btohqsg
Any cashback cards recommendation for big ticket purchase. Probably below 5-6k,btohqsg
I went down to branch personally to do interbank transfer of CPFIA investments from DBS to UOB. UOB CSO told me I need to sell off everything and cancel the account with DBS (physically at DBS) then can open an account with UOB. 🙂🙂🙂I went to DBS physically and they referred me back to UOB to open account and initiate the interbank transfer. 🙂🙂🙂🙂Don't think because they are physically in branch they are magically better.,btohqsg
Anyone know what is Tokopedia MCC? Its not on Heymaxx,btohqsg
Is True Cashback Amex the best card to input and save under Grab for highest cash rebate?,btohqsg
What do you mean input and save? Top-up Grab Wallet?,btohqsg
I understand what u mean but keep a picture of the queue ticket record the person name that is tending to u then if u dont get what u r promised write a formal email with all the evidences attached n appeal. It worked for me previously when i wasnt given the right info. But call in wrong info didnt work when i appeal,btohqsg
"I quoted what he said ""input and save for 1.5%"" hence i am clarifying. For top up it will only be 0.3% if i am not wrong",btohqsg
In any dispute  CSO verbal words against tnc black and white words. Which will carry weight? Have to keep a record of the conversation.,btohqsg
UOB big savings payout- hi gurus  if I registered for 150k fresh funds on 1st May.. can I split the deposit of 150k into 3 times at different dates within May itself? It will still count towards as the incremental  fresh funds rite?,btohqsg
Yes my former appeal was based on i needed clarification for the interpretation of the tnc hence i went down to the branch. The officer tending to me went to check with the manager n i have both person name. At the end they gave me the reward.,btohqsg
Yes but your own MAB will be affected,btohqsg
Not the highest. There is UOB EVOL (8% of $250 online)  also UOB One.,btohqsg
Thx then i stick to uob one,btohqsg
Oki.. since I’ll only have my money back at different dates on May no choice,btohqsg
Hi all  when does ocbc 360 take snapshot of bank balance to calculate MAB? Have 97k MAB now and was thinking to increase it to closer to 100k  but nor sure when to take out  also am concerned on the labour day holiday next day if thats any issue,btohqsg
End of day  check statement to be accurate,btohqsg
Any1 received this email? I only received notification but no email,btohqsg
Just to confirm  if i top up today and withdraw tomorrow… PH wouldnt have effect on the MAB right i would assume? ie. 1 May day end balance wouldnt take 30 Apr day end balance because of the PH right?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGif is freelancer  how to get the salary interest for OCBC 360 account?,btohqsg
1 May balance will take 30 Apr balance because of PH.,btohqsg
What i did was open my own company to pay myself,btohqsg
Open own company  get corporate bank account  pay yourself,btohqsg
The amount u play with must be big enough to be worth since there is cost involved with acra etc,btohqsg
What's the min to open corporate bank account?,btohqsg
I can only share old info since what i did was in the past,btohqsg
1k to open but no min balance. Cost invoked is more like paying acra bizfile etc and also annual filing depending on whether u setting up pte ltd or LLP or the other solo one i forgot the term,btohqsg
Im semi retired now so pardon my old info,btohqsg
Anyway heard now pte ltd can be solo also.. Last time cannot solo for pte ltd,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I hv participate in this promo 100K for uob stash instead coz my adb is 1k for Mar. For Uob one acc  can I check whether I should pump in 50K today (100k alr earmark for earlier promo) or on 2 May to get full eir 4% for 150K? Thanks!,btohqsg
If you put in 2-May wont that be 1 day short in May. You dont expect MAB to be 150k for May right? So you should put today since tomm is PH,btohqsg
Just curious if stashaway simple plus is also a good option as they don’t require to keep the fund for a fixed period. Although from past experience  they are very slow in returning the fund back to the bank account.,btohqsg
I wont able to put in today so for some of us in the similar situation  I will register again in May and put the 50k end of May. You will still get the bonus but later.,btohqsg
stashaway is different from GXS account.  One is an investment with risk and the other is bank account which is SDIC insured. So what are you comparing?,btohqsg
Thanks  but my funds in EGA so thinking whether worthwhile to do it  EGA promo is for Apr n May,btohqsg

Hi  can I just check  is there a way to “convert” insurance spending into other kind of spending?Like for example  sometimes credit card run promotions for retail spending. And they specifically exclude insurance spending. So I want to convert insurance spending into eligible retail spending,btohqsg
CardUp. But still depends on the promo/card exclusions.,btohqsg
"What is ""this promo"" referring to?",btohqsg
the base was 1.5% previously right?,btohqsg
The uob acc promotion  you can check it out,btohqsg
So you already registered 100k for UOB Stash underTHISpromo? And you want to register 50k for UOB One account underTHISpromo?,btohqsg
Nope  just want to get eir rate of 4% as Uob change their interest rate rules from May onwards,btohqsg

HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo for May is out.,btohqsg
If tnc say any amount  10 cents also can,btohqsg
Where did u see this ?,btohqsg
Hi Sorry to ask againIf new account open today  fund of $151k in the new account then i registered the big promo today or tomorrow?,btohqsg
Today in then today u register,btohqsg
Ok Thank you 👍🏻🙏🏻When i asked the UOB person told me to register in May  another one said still plenty of time bcos the promo until 29 June.,btohqsg
New account no need 151k. Just 150k.,btohqsg
Ok thank you 👍🏻So i can register for the big savings promo by today,btohqsg
Once you got the account details  just register with it and transfer 150k in liao. Don't wait already  now 6pm.,btohqsg
Oh okayI tot money should be in first then apply,btohqsg
Either way is fine  but both must be done today,btohqsg
Would like to check for those transfer $100K from one bank to another bank  is it must do it at the bank counter? Since online transfer is limited to $5k per day.,btohqsg
You can up transfer limit for online. Then set it back to 5k afterwards.,btohqsg
Anyone know the daily statement for moomoo what this number 6 means,btohqsg
Hahaha talking to UOB CSO is like Russian roulette.,btohqsg
Hi  any promo code for CardUp?,btohqsg
I meant for first time user,btohqsg
No more additional 1% on top of 3.45%?,btohqsg
That one is part of Everyday+ Rewards programme.,btohqsg
I think the up to 3.45 mean 1 percent is counted already (base interest rate for incremental might have been drop?),btohqsg
Yeah. It's the same. 3.55% p.a. from promo.,btohqsg
For uob big savings payout promotion is til 29 jun. So if I have already participated uob dragon promotion in Jan and currently the 100k is earmarked til 17may.So If I withdraw out on last day of May. And registered interest for big savings payout on 1st jun and put in 150k can work anot?Since I withdraw out 100k on last day of May Wil I still get the uob one interest for the month of may?,btohqsg
Wont work  it is based on mar mab  so the most u can only go for 50k fresh fund if u want to have 150 k inside uob one,btohqsg
I have 100k in UOB One right now  should i just transfer it into Mari invest which should net higher yield? Not intending to increase this cash position and in fact will likely be reducing it each month,btohqsg
But mari invest is a investment account to a fund  return and capital are not guaranteed,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether we can use our UOB krisflyer card for other people's ticket? Like I wont be flying with them. Just want to get the miles hahaha,btohqsg
So i can use my card to pay for their booking? Alrhough im not flying with them?Would the airline or the bank ask about the transaction since the name of the card and the person in the booking diff hahaha,btohqsg
Thts good. I havent applied yet. But mynparents keep flying scoot. So want to get some miles from it xD,btohqsg
By capital not guaranteed  you mean in the sense that the fund can theoretically collapse and monies all lost because it's not SDIC insured?,btohqsg
Maribank saving account is saving account  mari invest is like u go to a bank and buy hedge fund from them as an investment,btohqsg
Though the funds are generally quite safe but I wouldn’t suggest you to put everything inside as all investments have the possibility of going down.,btohqsg
Anyone can advise what is this aby and discover mode? Does it work like Xnap tat can pay using credit card?,btohqsg
You need to find out if they still can enjoy the Krisflyer-scoot benefit if you don’t fly with them. Eg. Additional 5kg  priority check in  free first time flight change benefit.You need to book thru dedicated Scoot landing page. Not thru OTA.,btohqsg
The card holder need to fly to enjoy the benefit. But u dont need to fly to get the miles,btohqsg
Then your uob MAB not 150k. Maybe you can put your fund at somewhere which better interest  end May then fund in together for May register.,btohqsg
Read the T&Cs instead of just looking at the info graphics. There's no changes to the requirements.,btohqsg
What is the interest like if we fullfilled the requirements,btohqsg
That's the condition to enjoy the 1% cashback on HSBC Debit card and GIRO Bill and bonus interest on top up amount,btohqsg
Seems the 2 human account method can still get 4.45%,btohqsg
Discover is a card issuer  similar to Amex  Diners.,btohqsg
Yes  but only if your incremental amt is more than 500k. For amount lesser than 500k  I think it is only 3.35% + 1%. I can't recall who posted the image of the May promo...,btohqsg
Oh  they updated their website already.,btohqsg
Yes melvyn posted may is 3.45%  on top u get 1% for up yo 300sgd payout so it's kinda max out at 360k. Why need more then 500k???,btohqsg
That is again info graphics from emailer. Lol. They say up to so they aren't wrong tho... Need to look at the T&Cs for the details such as the tiered interest rates.,btohqsg
Yea aren't wrong so below 500k but over 360k is 3.35% plus 300sgd. If over 500k u get 3.45% plus 300sgd. Lol,btohqsg
4.35% for 360k still quite worth it lah. Better then placing more then 500k for only 0.1% more,btohqsg
hi guys  if i use UOB debit card to make a transactions  does the transactions can approved instantly? need to hit the $500 spending,btohqsg
no  need merchant to post the transaction,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if the yuu 18% ends after this month? Thanks!,btohqsg
Does this transaction count for this calender mth or have to wait for it to be posted,btohqsg
Just checked Uob is not reflecting any interest paid yet. They are likely going to sneak in the interest payment at 11pm+ and u will not be able to react.,btohqsg
I don’t think Klook does same day posting.,btohqsg
too late already will count towards next month,btohqsg
The word “pending” means not yet posted.,btohqsg
The promo seems getting worse? From 3K USD for 100K USD deposit to 2950 Nvidia shares to 1050 USD cash? Even with the additional 3% moneybull boost still can't match with 3K cash? Or is my calculation wrong?,btohqsg
Hi guys  what's your experience in waiving the yearly fee for DBS Woman's World card?Mentions need to at least spend 15k per yr to be waived.My calculated expenses for this card is about 4k/yr only (travel specific spend) will there be a chance to get a waive?,btohqsg
which card is the best for first time credit card applier?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if use CIMB visa signature credit card pay for health hub payment does it consider approve spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
A query  if anyone had deposited long enough with the digital banks  since MariBank and GXS credits the interest daily  would there be a compounding effect?,btohqsg
Like for Mari  the current 2.88% would include the balance and interest of previous days,btohqsg
surely have compounding effect since its daily calculated,btohqsg
just try no matter what  i spent way below and still got it waived,btohqsg
I actually checked every 5 minutes. And as of now. No Uob interest has been credited for value date 30th April. But I suspect we will see some back dated posting.Which means no way to escape the MAB distortion if you were trying to keep it to $10 for example.,btohqsg
Confirm will based on the past. Just I never paid so much attention to when it was posted.If posted at 10pm region still can move out. But if they back date to 30th April when it never appeared on 30th April means no way to escape.,btohqsg
I did noticed for Mar they did backdate.. after their maintenance hours,btohqsg
Anyone know if i can move all cash out from ocbc 360 or i need wait until 7th working day for interest to credit in before moving,btohqsg
Cause i no more salary credit into ocbc this month so not using anymore,btohqsg
Want move 50k into uob to fulfill the 150k,btohqsg
If you’re not using anymore  doesn’t matter when you move it out. You can move before 7th since interest is based on your April mab,btohqsg
Hi   I have open my account in mid may to participate in the welcome bonus and subscribe to money bull.Am I still eligible to participate as an existing user and get 8.4% if I deposit more fund this month ?,btohqsg

Uob AM invest need how many days to approved .. mine still pending approval after 3 days,btohqsg
Someone reported even their office has been shuttered down. Just take it as its gone case. Don't keep your hopes too high.,btohqsg
You do know that investment means there is a possible loss of value for your money compared with putting in saving account?,btohqsg
Anyone use dollardex here? Appreciate can the experience  thanks,btohqsg
i set up hsbc giro to pay dbs credit bill last month. I got dbs cc statement today. how long does it take for hsbc to pay dbs? my hsbc has sufficient account.,btohqsg

Uob AM invest need how many days to approve.. mine still pending approval after 3 days,btohqsg

Otherwise the temporary suspend will become permanent suspend  probably the owner looking for buyer,btohqsg
Oh  sorry  were you the one who said their office has been shut down? If it is  there's still some hope although even their staff could be kept in the blind by their management.,btohqsg
Trust doesn't have atm withrawal fee I think. I only tried with 1 atm from Cathay United Bank (green color) and there was no bank fee charge.,btohqsg
Find a bank ATM. Not those inside 7-11 or at train station as these have charges. We withdrew at several bank ATMs with no additional charges and the rates are better than money changers,btohqsg
What do y’all use to pay at foodcourts and hawkers then? I’m using Grabpay and ShopBack  not sure is that’s the best alternative..,btohqsg

https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.pageEffective interest rate of UOB ONE revised?Seems to be 4.5% for 1st $150k instead of 4%. Or is it I see wrong?,btohqsg
Hi current I got 50k in UOB stash acc and 50k in UOB one.If I transfer 50k out from UOB stash today to other bankTomorrow transfer back 50k to UOB one acc  does it consider fresh fund and qualify UOB big savings payout?,btohqsg
4.5% only for mid tier from 75K-125K but EIR is 4%,btohqsg
Sry noob qn; how u get 4.5% EIR?,btohqsg
Not all banks will let you see the card details online. If not available  you can only wait for your physical card.,btohqsg
Huh really ah  I thought it’s compared against MAB in March.,btohqsg
What’s the next best telco plan besides ZYM $10 plan,btohqsg
Irritating. And u cannot take out the $4.24 today also,btohqsg
Oh wait must be blind. Paiseh,btohqsg
Yes but read the tnc. Money deposit or form submission  whichever is later. Your form submission is in May so only May deposit will count.,btohqsg
YupIt’s always backdated.Actually in system  I think it would only be withdrawable next morning. Coz I checked at 1am  3am  still doesn’t show interest but next morning 8am  it’s there liao and can transfer,btohqsg
based on the TnC  form submitted in May and he already have fresh fund by 31 May (in Apr)  so technically the earmark should occur in Jun. But then I think better to withdraw and redeposit in May to be extra safe.,btohqsg
https://sg.shp.ee/WkJwyxGSo I top up $200 via PayNow equivalent then get 200 Shopee Coins.

Means I earned $2 worth of coins without spending anything ah?Has anyone tried?Oh ya  can only have 1 free withdrawal per month  so pls check 1st before u try.,btohqsg
no way to get EIR 4.5% for UOB One now  but u can get more if coupled with UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion,btohqsg
EIR 4% as per website >> Maximum effective interest rate (EIR) on the One Account is 4.00% p.a. for deposits of S$150 000  provided customers meet both criteria of S$500 eligible card spend AND a min. S$1 600 salary credit via GIRO/PAYNOW (with the transaction reference “SALA” / “PAYNOW SALA”) in each calendar month.,btohqsg
Yes. Sry I wasn’t paying attention to mid tier interest of 4.5%. Thanks for pointing it out.,btohqsg

then u need to see what is your Mar MAB and Apr MAB,btohqsg
Later tommorrow call bank.I never withdraw from this account so automatically average balance should increase month on month basis. If incoming funds are on same date everymonth.,btohqsg
Do you mean multiple 200 coins?,btohqsg
Means top up $200 cash  Shopee credits 200 coins.Then u withdraw back the $200.Can only do once as per TnC,btohqsg
Hi  any idea how does SC Smart Card calculates its point? i.e is there any rounding involved per transaction or per statement month. The TnC illustrative seems to show points are calculated per statement month but there’s no clear wordings on it,btohqsg
hi..happy labour day....my march MAB $101 717.79..i must put 50k + $1717.79 right?for the big savings promo 50k tier,btohqsg
Got my answer from live chat  this promo is only eligible for new user and not existing users regardless whether they've participated in Moneybull or not,btohqsg
Seems that uob has the best promo for cash = $150k,btohqsg
Is it worth to use cardup?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check is it only me or did Foodpanda just removed most of the self pick up discounts??,btohqsg
How do i check via ocbc apps that i have met 500 mthly increment and payroll and that I meet the requirements to get the bonus interest ?,btohqsg
Nope.3.45% p.a. is just 3.4% p.a. from promo (above 500k) + 0.05% p.a. from base interest. 3.3% p.a. from promo if below 500k (total 3.35% p.a.).1% p.a. (max of $300) has always been under HSBC Everyday+ Rewards programme separate from the promo.Basically it's 4.1% (for 500k) or 4.35% p.a. (below 360k) for HSBC EGA now  including promo.,btohqsg
Have to check on website  app doesn't show,btohqsg
Weird. My wife account still have the discounts...,btohqsg
I think is the Dine In discount that has ended. Self pick up depends on merchant.,btohqsg
Now it’s time to bank run UOB bank since the interest rate has reduced,btohqsg
"if just approved (within few min/hours)- and online - activate (without received physical card yet) you can get in the SC App find your card there is ""Get CVV"" click and you will find it.",btohqsg
Hi gurus  i cancelled my cc last year April  if I apply today for cimb cc am I qualify for this promotion?,btohqsg
Should be  but I will cfm my doubt with their CS first before applying,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I got about $60k sitting in UOB One and understand that they are changing their interest rates from May onwards. I have OCBC 360 account too so not sure if it’s best to switch it back to OCBC or any other acc that is better? Thanks in advance 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Does anyone know if use CIMB visa signature credit card pay for health hub payment does it consider approve spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
Just give a quick call/message to CS to confirm before applying,btohqsg
My self pick up discounts are all missing. My wife's account still present. Anyone else faced similar issue as me?,btohqsg
As Mt mentioned previously  above $360K in HSBC EGA will not get the max effective additional 1% from Everyday+ rewards  may not be worth to pursue 500K tier (edit: law of diminishing returns since it is maxed out at 360K),btohqsg
OCBC may be the highest for now at 4.65% p.a. (edit: for $100K tier) if you fulfill the criterias  but how long will it last  nobody knows,btohqsg
For uob one acct  any min balance reqd to get the bonus interest for April if i transfer all out today and leave it zero balance?,btohqsg
For 60k it's actually only 3.8% p.a. if got salary  spend and save. Without save (following UOB requirements) it's 2.6% p.a.  so 3% from UOB One account is better if we don't include save criteria.If all criteria it's 6.2% p.a. but getting insurance or investing with them? 🤮Highest for under 75k would be HSBC EGA incremental funds promo and everyday+ rewards at 4.35% p.a.,btohqsg
Right  i missed the $60k. Was assuming $100K tier in my head,btohqsg
Anyone like me emptied uob one for this month? I will move my funds to ega for 4.35% and ocbc for 4.6%,btohqsg
I'm moving to HSBC EGA for the next 2 months as I won't be eligible for 4.6% p.a. on OCBC 360.I also suspect that they will announce the nerf of OCBC 360 this month.,btohqsg
Only worth to do it for 1 month... For the 2nd month.. Ur 1% bonus is based on increment from May ADB,btohqsg
EGA interest is slow .... its around 3 months late ? good things are worth the wait ba ....,btohqsg
If you read the t&c  earning period is for May and Jun  referencing to Mar ADB.,btohqsg
Aug  so technically only 2 months late for May  1 month late for Jun.Higher interest would still be better. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Unless they compound daily then it depends on how close the rates are.,btohqsg
3.3% EGA bonus is based on mar adb for 2 months  1% from everyday rewards program is based on month-on-month.... Very sneaky on hsbc if u r not careful.,btohqsg
For me  3.35% p.a. is still better than 3% p.a. 🤪,btohqsg
HSBC EGA need $2k incremental ADB?,btohqsg
2k deposit* and 5 transactions out,btohqsg
This is the 1% from Everyday+ Cashback rewards. Like I said  my next best alternative is 3% p.a.  which HSBC EGA promo gives more at 3.35% p.a.,btohqsg
Thanks! Time to look into it too 🤣🤣 previously I was looking at Bonus$aver because the criterias were very easy to hit. But then nerfed 💀,btohqsg
As of 30 April the average daily balance increase vs last mth is nil  though I have fufilled the salary requirement right but I am not qualified for the bonus right ?Cos i open ocbc 360 in Mar but I only deposit cash on 1 Apr and my salary is credited in Apr.,btohqsg
If you're asking for Apr's bonus interest  I think you will clock the Save criteria with that.,btohqsg
Would think ur increase will be ur full April average daily balance,btohqsg
$2k must be fresh funds or can withdraw and deposit again?,btohqsg
But is reflected as 0 as of 30 April in website. Which is strange- cos i open the acct in Mar and first deposit money on 2 Apr. meaning mar is 0 and apr is x amount. So yep  shld be the full increment,btohqsg
But is showing 0 via ocbc website,btohqsg
If I registered near end April. Now I transfer 100k from UOB. What is the effective interest rate for HSBC EGA?100k in UOB account meeting all criteria will not meet 4% right.So I assume EGA should be better off. Please kindly advise. Thanks,btohqsg
Maybe can check with CSO. They should be able to provide the data from backend?,btohqsg
So if I register for an account now  I’m thinking I can only make it for 1 month which is June right? Cos they need to see the increment from prev month?Actually quite confused with how HSBC EGA work 😅 their calculator not helpful also,btohqsg
Mine also showing 0 as of April 30. Very strange. Yesterday when I checked it was 5xx+,btohqsg
T&c states reference month is Apr. Additional 1% comes from Everyday+ Rewards programme  which effective for 1 month only.The next account you can look at is SC eSaver account.I'm in a similar issue where don't have 75k  a lot of accounts give the basic bonus interest of 3% or less. 🤪,btohqsg
If you registered in April  then you have to look at April's t&c.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if I currently have earmark with uob. Can I apply another one and qualified for the bonus cash credit?,btohqsg
Yup agree. HSBC EGA is complicated,btohqsg
Hahah HSBC EGA too confusing for me maybe I stick with OCBC 360 for now 🤣,btohqsg
If yes  will the new earmark drag the 1st earmark date further as the 2nd earmark date?,btohqsg
Just to check do I need to keep my funds in UOB One acc till I get the interest or can I withdraw it today to shift it to OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Calculated for future reference  4.15% p.a. if 500k  including Everyday+ Rewards programme.,btohqsg
I saw the T&C  if I registered in April for the promotion. They will compare to the flash funds deposited in May minus off the what was held in April.I had to keep the money inside for May and June. I just want to check as the interest paid in Aug. can I draw out the money in 1st July?Any thanks for any good advise.,btohqsg
You did not read April's t&c. Check out April's t&c first.,btohqsg

Assuming your current earmark was from Jan's promo and the earmark ends mid May.Your earmark registration in May for earmarking in Jun under Apr's promo don't even overlap anymore.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this! Essentially only the 1st month is 4+%. The 2nd month is only 3+%,btohqsg
April average daily balance mot match lah,btohqsg
Hi where to apply this CIMB cc to get this offer? I could not find from their website,btohqsg
HSBCSG: Thank you for your interest in the April EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. We acknowledge your registration based on xxxxxx that you have keyed in earlier.

I just sent the EGA SMS  I realised that the SMS still reflects Apr EGA and not May EGA.,btohqsg
🤣 maybe they never work today to change the sms template,btohqsg
Yup same! They didn't update. So lousy,btohqsg
Where did you find this message? The info is all wrong lol. You should refer to the t&c document provided by HSBC - forApril's promo.,btohqsg
Oh. From Google. Haiz  can’t find the article 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
They don't bother to update the SMS. Really minus points for HSBC,btohqsg
"https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185057Don't bother opening the pdf link as they lazily replace the document (notice ""lny"" for Lunar New Year). I assume is the same person/team updating the SMSes. Someone should fire this guy at HSBC. 🤡Ref to Mar ADB  promo's bonus interest applies to Apr and May  credits in Jul.The 2nd month don't get the 1% from Everyday+ Rewards fyi.",btohqsg
Must be the same guy who upload the EGA bonus interest promo pdf document.,btohqsg
CardUp provids a very useful calculator on their website. Maybe you should check it out.,btohqsg
Yes  the interest base on April MAB.,btohqsg
I'm sure Chris did indicate which promo is for New  Existing or both customers.,btohqsg
If you don't plan to get May's interest then transfer today.,btohqsg
It should not matter for you anyway since you left Mar empty.,btohqsg
Got this msg when trying to login,btohqsg
I logged in 3 times for the past 5 mins no issues. In fact I'm using it now lol,btohqsg
Hi! Wanted to check if I sign up big savings promo for May  should I input money now (1-May) or 31st May?,btohqsg
Ok so its not just me 😪,btohqsg
Same I tried many times 10 mins ago,btohqsg
My turn already 🤡 the app just keep trying to authenticate,btohqsg
Ya  will wait awhile and try again later,btohqsg
Nvm I already logged in again lol. Just took about 1 min of authentication,btohqsg
Can try again ba  I managed to login within a second liao..,btohqsg
No issues logging in for me.,btohqsg
Thinking of taking out cash from one account and OCBC 360.What are the best places to put the cash in now? Other than moomoo and syfe / stash way guarantee ?,btohqsg
Depends on your salary  depends on your spending. You can check out Chris' YouTube video on the best cashback/miles card.,btohqsg
Did you manage to login to their app?Either there's an add to Apple Pay or Google Pay or see CVV button.,btohqsg
I'm suspecting that an authority-level entity made them suspend their services to either scam/abuse-proof their services  especially with the recent rise on those scummy people asking for businesses' QRs.I doubt it's a financial issue since they managed to operate SG  SK and PH  and expanding to JP  VN and KH.Don't quote my words  just thinking out loud 🤣,btohqsg
Hi  I have a policy (not under UOB) that is maturing and proceeds will be paynowed to my UOB. Will this be considered as fresh funds to qualify for the UOB savings promo?,btohqsg
Y not u PayNow to other account and transfer Into UOB to be more certain of it,btohqsg
Yes as its source is not from UOB & your Acct balance increased,btohqsg
Cause I alr set instructions for great eastern to paynow to the account before this promo came up. Hope can change the instructions in time.,btohqsg
Is it still possible to create an ibkr LLC account for SG users?,btohqsg
Now that XNAP is unavailable  what are other options we can use at hawkers?,btohqsg
Hi guys.. can I check if dbs women world Mastercard can earn 4mpd if use on Shopee(Apple Pay) or other Apple Pay payment online?,btohqsg
Sad. You could have gotten earmarked and out of earmark a month earlier since you already have the funds on 30 Apr.Unless.. you have existing earmarked funds in Jan and it only ends in May. 😩 But seems unlikely.,btohqsg
Should be fine.. GE belongs to OCBC and uses OCBC bank account anyway.,btohqsg
"""Best"" depends on what you're looking for. I wouldn't say ZYM $10 plan is the best. I'm sure@kelvintaninvestkeeps a pretty updated spreadsheet on all the SIM only plans. You can find it on his YouTube video.",btohqsg
LiquidPay is topped up using PayNow. People are paying with XNAP for the CC spend/rewards. So no.,btohqsg
If you don't intend to use UOB One for interest in May then just transfer out all today. Then withdraw the Apr bonus interest when it gets credited.,btohqsg

UOB to keep 150k to get $500 a month. But with OCBC I don’t have salary crediting.,btohqsg
Why don't salary credit to OCBC then transfer in and out of UOB?,btohqsg
Because initially I don’t have a salary crediting. With UOB it does not have to be a company that credit a salary. For OCBC it must be made from corporate account,btohqsg
Oh not new account  trf back to original old acc. So uob may final 5% interest today can trf out or need to wait interest come liao then can trf out?,btohqsg
Oh. I'm assuming you still don't have salary credit  you can keep 150k in UOB One account (I'm assuming you also registered for earmarking promo for the 50k fresh funds).The rest you might want to check out HSBC EGA? You can register for the bonus interest promo (additionally with Everyday+ Rewards) and get 4.35% p.a. on fresh funds too.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/194175,btohqsg

Firstly  use Heymax check what is the mcc code of healthhub.Secondly  read the TnC of the credit card  search the mcc code of the eligible category using description in Heymax.Compare the two.,btohqsg
I got a question for UOB Big Savings Promo:I submitted the form on 30 Apr 2024 for 50k earmark.I deposited 50k on 30 Apr 2024 also.My MAB for Mar 2024 is 100 084.79.With 50k deposited yesterday  my 30th April 2024 Balance is only 150050.Is it I will not qualify for the earmark in May 2024 since my balance is 150 050  not 150 084.79?,btohqsg
Are you the actor Lin Ming Lun?,btohqsg
hahahaha..the real one wouldn't care for $250 UOB payout,btohqsg
I think it may work although nobody try before. UOB may ignore 01 May(PH) n calculate from 02 May onwards. Let us know if it work once it is earmarked. At least got 1 dp as reference.Edited: I mean top up another $35 today or tomorrow.,btohqsg
Meaning yesterday  I must hv 150084.79 in the Bank?,btohqsg
I mean top up another $35 today or tomorrow.,btohqsg
yes. can register in May and have this amount by 31 May,btohqsg
Will update u all.. I just topup 100,btohqsg
the extra $150 in the bank only earn 0.05%,btohqsg
Yup.. just have that and register this month. Earmark next month.,btohqsg
Yeah.. bobian.. hope will still qualify and earmarked in this May,btohqsg
Preferred to get earmarked this May,btohqsg
by right will not earmark in May. Up to u if u want to try your luck,btohqsg
how come need top-up .. they won't deduct from the existing amount inside?,btohqsg
Meaning it will get earmarked in Jun?,btohqsg
if register in May and have the earmark amount+mar mab by 31 May,btohqsg
Feel bad for my mistake 😞,btohqsg
You register again in May to overwrite for april. End May balance >$150084..79.,btohqsg
he just trying his luck. Anyway can withdraw if not earmarked in May and topup back to the required amount by 31 May such that May MAB is $15000,btohqsg
not sure if it helps. I was short of a few dollars for min salary requirements. after calling the customer service  it was managed to appeal after a week.,btohqsg
Thx.. Maybe I should call tomorrow to appeal,btohqsg
ya. i think u get my point. i wasn't confident at first  but i just made a call and managed to get it. good luck.,btohqsg

not excluded for uob one account card spend. For evol  uob$ merchants excluded from 8% but count to min spend. Esso not uob$ merchant,btohqsg
Weird. Uob one bonus interest not in yet,btohqsg

Hi all  for the Moomoo 6.8% promo  do yall choose to subscribe to the Fullerton SGD cash fund or liquidity fund? Why?,btohqsg

Can you rephrase your question? A bit hard to understand.,btohqsg
there is nothing like that on the app..,btohqsg
I'm using sc mobile Singapore app... i can only see card number and expiry date,btohqsg
where do I find get cvv.. there is no such option,btohqsg
Hi  If I just signed up for (new) UOB one account this month.Sign up for the UOB Big savings promo for this month  do I deposit the amount in today or end of the month?,btohqsg
Do you intend to get 4% p.a. interest for May?,btohqsg
anytime so long you have earmark amount+Mar MAB by 31 May 10.30pm,btohqsg
Yes  intend to earn 4% int.Apologies. Edited to add in more details.,btohqsg
To ride on when will the amount be earmarked ? I’m doing the April month .,btohqsg
Today put in the posted date should be tomorrow right since its public holiday..,btohqsg
Is there like a formula to calculate cashback. Cause I rmb Chris mentioned it once in his video,btohqsg
I just top up 50k also...,btohqsg
May i understand why several of u mentioned 155k instead of 150k ah?,btohqsg
I only top up to 150k...,btohqsg
Card gives 3% cashback = transaction amount × 3%Card gives 5% cashback = transaction amount × 5%Card gives 8% cashback = transaction amount × 8%Not sure what you're asking for  but this is the math,btohqsg
To maintain MAB at 150k. Transactions today do not count. You have to keep it at 155k unless you already have 150k on 30 Apr.Or if he not interested to get the full 4% p.a.  then he can just ignore.,btohqsg
MAB in march is 100k so now make it 150k,btohqsg
I see. Because of the public holiday so today bank in will be counted as tomorrow,btohqsg
Pls correct my maths if i am wrong.1st May 100k2nd May till 31st May 151666.67Then MAB for May is 150k,btohqsg
Isnt cashback just eligible spent amount  multiplying cashback %? Or do you mean miles vs cashback equivalent calc?,btohqsg
For those with 100k already on 30 Apr then sure. But OP is new account.,btohqsg
U r right. I was counting how much i need to top up. Cash is tight balance three 100k accounts,btohqsg
There's a lot new account openings even though nerf. Because people start to realise it's easier and higher overall interest with fresh fund of 150k.,btohqsg
Didnt treasure the last one year,btohqsg
"Search ""UOB amaze"". Unless it's not a UOB card then maybe new but also similar issue.",btohqsg
I found the answer. Thank you! Apparently ongoing issue between amaze and UOB,btohqsg
Better double check the actual MAB for Mar in the app. It's pretty impossible to be 100000 on the dot.,btohqsg
If can't find then wait for physical card ba,btohqsg
Thank you. I did. Its 100000.01,btohqsg
I did my maths for the previous month in Feb to hit nicely for March.,btohqsg
That 1 cent steps between whether you get earmarked or not.,btohqsg
Yea so instead of 151666.66 i make it 151666.67 to make up for it,btohqsg
If u value 1 mile as 1.5 cents  4 mpd is equals to 6% cashback. If can get higher than 6%  then use cashback card.,btohqsg
Samsung online store  which card to use? HSBC revo or citi-rewards with amaze?,btohqsg
Not sure about Samsung storeBut I use shopback to earn myself 2 percent cashback,btohqsg
Ooo... I was chatting with Samsung chat earlier  was told using the Samsung store app  first time got 10% off.  Comparing the cost via the app and online  there a good 80$ different..,btohqsg
So just thinking with card now is better to earn the miles...,btohqsg
Hello Gurus may I ask on UOB's　Big Savings Promotion？If march month average of my UOB one account was was 50K and currently as of May 1 I have 100K in the UOB One account. By placing incremental 100K the total will be 200K.Since I apply to have only 100K as incremental  to maintain max 150K WHEN CAN I WITHDRAW THE 50K?,btohqsg
If March MAB is 50k and Apr EMB is 100k  then make sure it's 152k tomorrow (top-up 52k) to earmark 100k fresh funds and maintain 150k MAB for 4% p.a. interest. How did you get 200k?,btohqsg
Is there any miles card to use for town council payment,btohqsg
"Have you searched ""town council card"" or ""town council miles""?",btohqsg
Considering campaign return I thought maybe more efficient to put in incremental 100K. Since only 100K will get earmarked (so current 100K + incremental 100K = 200K)  I assumed I can at some point take out 50K since in March I only had 50K in my account,btohqsg
you need to topup $50k to get $150k ($100k earmark amount+Mar MAB of $50k),btohqsg
Still don't get why 100k + 100k... Your Mar MAB is 50k  your registered fresh funds is 100k.. 50k + 100k = 150k..,btohqsg
So the 50K I currently already have in is counted towards my 100K!!,btohqsg
understood now!! thank you so much@MelvynEzi@Trazora! You guys saved me from putting random excess cash. Much apprecaited!,btohqsg
Also better to check Mar MAB from the app. Make sure you top-up at least 100k above the Mar MAB shown on the app.,btohqsg
He means Mar $50k  add Apr $50k  add May $100k,btohqsg
I know but why. But he also explained after 🤣,btohqsg
Thank you for this tip will go online and make sure I fulfill the full 50K topup,btohqsg
He want $100k above Mar MAB (around $50k),btohqsg
Even 1 cent can determine whether you get earmarked or not. For maintaining 150k MAB in May to get 4% p.a.  assuming it's currently 100k  do make sure it's 152k tomorrow till end of month.,btohqsg
Can I ask why 152K and not 150?,btohqsg
Your MAB will only be 148k. If you don't mind losing $10 interest can ignore.,btohqsg
I see...Does the amount already earmarked for rising dragon still count as part of the incremental fund?,btohqsg
You still have earmarked fund? When does it get released? I assume it's the 50k that you clocked MAB in Mar.,btohqsg
It is earmarked earlier than the promotion period then it may not be counted as fresh fund,btohqsg
Anyone know how to maximise the UOB one account interest? I have spend 500 and salary credit… but the month end interest does not seems to show,btohqsg
Earmarked funds will never be fresh funds since it never left your account.Also you can try to register this month but your 100k incremental funds may not get earmarked. At most try registering again in Jun or wait for Jul promo (if have).,btohqsg
Bonus interest only comes in on 2nd business day of the month.,btohqsg
oh! I had no idea that earmarked fund will not be part of incremental - thank you for the info. will keep in mind,btohqsg
Hopefully you can get the 100k earmarked  then it'll be a new data point.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! I try and see :),btohqsg
Today is public holiday. Bank staffs are not working. You have a good rest. Please check again tomorrow.,btohqsg
Anyone can see this promo on Webull for existing clients? Because I can’t see it  not sure why not,btohqsg
I don't see it as well 😔,btohqsg
I’m checking with Webull now  talking to them,btohqsg
They say it’s a user target promotion,btohqsg
This one shows up to $7 500 cash vouchers,btohqsg
Hihi anybody knows those registration for marathon or spartan race is what MCC code ?,btohqsg

#dpUsed ShopBack Pay at Gain City transaction classified as 5814 Fast Food,btohqsg
I split the payment between WWMC and Revo  and used ShopBack Pay. Both classified as 5814. Mind blown 🤯,btohqsg
Shopback can be quite crazy with mcc at time,btohqsg
At least got data point that allocate fastfood to gain city now haha,btohqsg
I thought so too until I saw these,btohqsg
guess need to check mcc if charge direct  lol,btohqsg
No. ShopBack. Fave. Kris+. Changipay.All can change mcc albeit ShopBack is rare to change mcc.,btohqsg
Shopback + Citi Cashback = 6% at Gain City 😂,btohqsg
Need to factor in Fcy risk n Fcy conversion loss of about 3.26%. Actual return may be lower after the Fcy loss.,btohqsg
Try to bite into your electronics.. maybe it's cake 🤣,btohqsg
Haha… my teeth might be falling off after that,btohqsg
Lower or higher I guess.Still all in all I can’t see anything else more attractive than this  can you ?,btohqsg
I don’t see it attractive because of 3.26% loss. I personally will prefer moomoo 6.8% if want to choose between the two.,btohqsg
Question for Stash doing the promo.Since Stash is only 3%.And the promo likely end somewhere say Mid May when UOB release the earmark $100k back to you.Still have to tahan the $100k at 3% all the way until end of month right? 3% is lower than many other such as EGA/eSaver.So Stash is a very bad account to do the UOB Promo IMO.,btohqsg
3 percent to hold till the end for earmark promo is not that bad as u percieve since i am only going to all out for hsbc ega in jun,btohqsg
“get cvv” is just below your total outstanding of credit card (Home page)try check in next day/after 12 hours. because activate the sc app need 12hours cold down.i manage to saw it next day.please note if you activate the physical card you cannot view the cvv any more.i cannot show mine anymore as i just activated my physical card yesterday   .,btohqsg
Disappointed  they clearly written for existing user . Must as well switch to moomoo for 6.8%,btohqsg
Hello is there any promotion to sign up for UOB credit cards now?,btohqsg
If u are new to uob credit card sign up   u can refer to singsaver,btohqsg
Did you participate Webull promo before n withdraw money when promo ended?,btohqsg
I only participate in the welcome bonus in April,btohqsg
I’m even going so far as to skip the Uob one account until I have a $1000 account to do Plunging Chicken on.$100k existing + $50k earmark is not worth it to me for 4.5 months lock-in. Only approx 4.4% pa.I rather put in HSBC EGA and play musical chairs. Also about 4.5% pa and no lock in.,btohqsg
Hi   can I check does using cardup to pay for my car insurance premiums counts as the qualifying reward for first time Amex krisflyer credit card? Minimum spend $500 to get 27000 krisflyer points.Thanks,btohqsg
Yep  exactly what I've done. Will empty my account for May and June  and divert all spendings from uob one card to ocbc 365 instead.,btohqsg
U hero ah.I keep $1 001 still.,btohqsg
Any reason why empty out for both May and June when June (assuming used as base month) should be sufficient for the upcoming earmark promo (if any)?,btohqsg
"Hahaha I also emptied to $0 🌚 I still have 1 or 2 months left on the ""first 6 months"" 🤪Now all in HSBC EGA.",btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone knows if citirewards carries any exclusions for klook spending? (Ie much like hsbc revolution)?,btohqsg
Yes. There are exclusion clause in TnC.,btohqsg
Because Uob one at 4% pa for $150k isn’t really that great,btohqsg
Withdraw all out at the end of May and transfer it somewhere else. Only paired with the promo then worth it,btohqsg
But musical chairs very troublesome. Have to find alternative after one month,btohqsg
Hi guys  I signed up for 2 credit cards with priority pass access. How can I ensure that I am able to use the visits separately in order to maximise the number of visits?,btohqsg
each card has their own login  so its 2x per account,btohqsg
I see  the priority pass (PP) account is tagged to my email address too right? Is it of any concern if 2 PP accounts is tagged to a single email,btohqsg
Or do I need a separate email for each PP account/app?,btohqsg
perfectly fine but the usernames need to be diff,btohqsg
not sure if mine is also to the same email but i think so  no issues,btohqsg
Few years ago  I got it around Aug  until I keep chasing Iras 🥹,btohqsg
You forget... 100k stuck on 1st May  1 day alone equates to 3k+ MAB. How I wish I can go into negative balance. Lol,btohqsg
"Likely June MAB will be used for the next round of ""dropping pheonix"" promotion. 😉",btohqsg
Nope. I withdrew on 30th April already to $1 001 because I kept $103 500 in April for 29 days.,btohqsg
Anybody withdraw from ibkr before? Usually how long it takes for money to bank in? Its been 4-5 days and no money come in yet after my withdrawal request,btohqsg
Same day for IBKR llcT+1 for IBKR sgThis refers to sgd.,btohqsg
Then its been so long sia. I contact them and ask,btohqsg
Thanks for this. Just checked my dbs cc bill and got giro line. They will deduct on due date  not when statement is generated.,btohqsg
Was hoping someone have a sample of this and just nice you sent 🤣Because DBS send me email say HSBC rejected my GIRO form  but HSBC side say they approved my GIRO already,btohqsg
Anyone encountered this? Has been like that since yesterday...,btohqsg
No issue for me  just logged in,btohqsg
Hey guys  I'm still using a basic POSB account and thinking of upgrading now that I'm working.Any suggestions on which savings account to use to maximise interest fuss free? I have CRMC and HSBC Revo credit cards now.,btohqsg
