Eh boss ah  wanna check if your editorial still features cars from the community?,btohqsg
can i join the queue dont waste the car COE alr paid,btohqsg
well  M3 still definitely more worth than AE86 at that price point ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
a lot of contis IMO are overprice in the name of being conti when at the country of origin they are cars made for the mass. VAGs are fine examples,btohqsg
but they are not performing at the price that they are being sold,btohqsg
Later just before ending perhaps last half hr or so  will shoot skywards,btohqsg
Hi@skylar313  I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s us leh. We have only featured cars from the community in 2 Youtube videos:1.Tesla Model 3 feat. @Tesla Astronaut2.Honda Civic Type R EK9 (Featuring Speed Kaki Reviews)Are these the features that you are referring to?,btohqsg
He driving a classic scheme plate VW Beetle. Maybe can collaborate for a feature@skylar313,btohqsg
Of course that buyer of Toyota is insane. Itâ€™s a Corolla quality. Is he nuts,btohqsg
Interesting. What kind of collaboration do you have in mind? We can always bring it up to the relevant departments and see if they want to pick it up!,btohqsg
This is the last of bmw v8 non turbo high revv engine. Itâ€™s simply magnificent engine. Redlines at 8400,btohqsg
Great sound. Thatâ€™s why bought. ðŸ˜‚ but donâ€™t think it appreciates in value,btohqsg
U have a m3  I got a mz3,btohqsg
Mazda 3? Daily I use Mazda 6. Lovely,btohqsg
This is the real sound   while I am trying to install fake sound hope lta approve,btohqsg
My modest e30 feels just like the more powerful m3. Balance braking handling. Same.,btohqsg
He is notâ€¦ he is rich beyond xx,btohqsg
Turbo engines canâ€™t make sound like that.,btohqsg
V8 sound best   turbo is like pop pop pop,btohqsg
I blast it on NS easily 220 to 260,btohqsg
Lexus lc500 and Ferrari also sound great in Thier v8,btohqsg
I am trying to install it in my car but Singapore no boom box feature for us,btohqsg
Often I see Mercedesâ€™ challenging me,btohqsg
But came across a yellow Urus. Super fast,btohqsg
These 2 are the trouble maker usually,btohqsg
What can you try to install to,btohqsg
The main difference between German cars and Japanese  lie in touring. Euro cars great at touring.,btohqsg
You got to use it longer to make you smile,btohqsg
Yup a45 is fast Maserati is surprisingly very slow   a lot of noise but car not moving,btohqsg
