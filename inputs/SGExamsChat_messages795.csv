Either that or can just buy one from the general office,btohqsg
HiI wanna know if sec 5 is worth taking cos if next year I can't pfp and fo sec 5 is it good?,btohqsg
or you can just screen shot the entry proof,btohqsg
Tbh it rlly depends in my opinion,btohqsg
If you die die want go poly  would recommend pfp  esp since heard a lot of good things from it,btohqsg
It's up to you but I would really recommend getting the result first and making the decision then,btohqsg
I do rlly want to go pfp,btohqsg
Have any tips to improve my El?,btohqsg
Yeah either ways it's better to focus on your N levels for now as there is no action required,btohqsg
whats ur current emb3  ur latest results,btohqsg

also English got bell curve so that‚Äôs an advantage,btohqsg
I did go for mun and they said it is not bad for a 1st timer,btohqsg
I would prob recommend Sec 5 if you have a good foundation in your current subjects,btohqsg
Wait if I take o lvl subject now in sec 5 will I be excused?,btohqsg
I think this is v subjective + depends on the school,btohqsg
My school na lvl standard is like neighborhood express school,btohqsg
This is the reason why alot of people of this generation said life was hard.. it puts into a perspective that is unlike anything you will ever get to experience,btohqsg
literally for 40+ yrs of their life   they were always in a world wide struggle of some sort not like the personal struggles so many of us experience today,btohqsg
I rather go to war and do trough great depression than study,btohqsg
By the way what is your opinion on business engineering?,btohqsg
Like is it a good job?,btohqsg
Yes both their generation  our parents generation and even our generation face struggles..But their generation faced worldwide struggles  something our parents and our generation will hardly ever get to experience again.the struggles our parents and now us faced are personal struggles where one if they wanted to could change their future  the people of those times could not..Its so poignant because it puts into perspective that this portion of the human experience is unlikely ever to get experienced by us,btohqsg
True especially since there is a human right law,btohqsg
This impression is also why you find the people that fought in ww1/ww2 are so reluctant to talk about their experiences,btohqsg
Wish rand was still here want to hear his opinion on this,btohqsg
this generation had a nickname actually,btohqsg
"they were called the ""Greatest generation""",btohqsg
Like u mean the 2000 to 2008 gen?,btohqsg

But tbh those born after 2008 is all gone case,btohqsg
when you look at the accomplishments of this gen of ppl born in the 1900s..its literally remarkleble what they have done in 100 years,btohqsg

goddam my classmate on insta alrdy did 7 yrs of tysüíÄ,btohqsg
but did they do it correctly,btohqsg
half of them are off syllabus üíÄ,btohqsg
when you buy tys..its more like 6 yrs instead of 10,btohqsg
cause moe refreshes subjects every 6 yrs,btohqsg
i can also go on insta and say im a millionaire,btohqsg
dont believe wtv ppl say online,btohqsg
In fact im not a 16 yo girl im actually  40yo man,btohqsg
WAH..were you laid off during the financial crisis?,btohqsg
Because I never had a job in the first place,btohqsg
but you dont sound like a 40 yo man,btohqsg
Can't be laid off if you were never employed to begin with,btohqsg
I use chatgpt to help me type like a 16yo girl,btohqsg
chatgpt doesnt sound like that too,btohqsg
what did you use it for? checking for long lost family members?,btohqsg
lowkey wanna get a webcam to use gpt 4o with hw,btohqsg
I bought physics tys in tm,btohqsg
idk y it sometimes makes my throat otch,btohqsg

but idk y a few times it made ny throat itch,btohqsg
so i rather just order w/o it,btohqsg
now i just prefer duck egg,btohqsg
I have not even bought them yet,btohqsg
Got approached by 36m  I'm 18. He thought I was in uni (20+). Is this normal in sg? üíÄ,btohqsg
I mean even if I was 20+ isn't it still weird for someone his age to approach,btohqsg
once you're adults it's a very diff context,btohqsg
like that specific approach creepy or not is debatable but if it's adults to adults,btohqsg
Did the bot delete its banned messages,btohqsg
oh yea apparently in yishun got one uncle approached a girl standing outside of a tuition centre pretending to ask for directions n proceed reach his hand for her chest...,btohqsg
Go To JailGo directly to Jail. Do not pass GO  do not collect $200,btohqsg
"Apparently someone told him that they'll call the police lol he responded ""never mind lah  its okay lah""",btohqsg
its the uncle promotion for changi prison,btohqsg
The uncle is looking for the just say no card,btohqsg
It wouldn't be creepy if it was adults?,btohqsg
more of perception on what's an acceptable age difference changes as one gets older,btohqsg
but idk how the person approached you so can't comment on that la,btohqsg
"Honestly  I kena this before when I was in JC. Some random old ass guy arnd his 35s to 40s being like ""Do you know the elephant story""  ""Do you knoe the chicken rice story"".",btohqsg
Like stfu man I wan meet my sec sch friend üòÇ,btohqsg
He just stopped me from behind and basically said I was cute then ask for telegram. I told him my age and we chatted for a bit. It was very random  he was telling me ab his job n stuff,btohqsg
Weird part is i recall it at an mrt station,btohqsg
Waiting for Si Yan to approach me,btohqsg
"i waiting for bus one time in sec school  this middle age women clad in like some sparkly outfit ask me ""where is this location""..i look up the location  its pinpoint is inside a garbage collection building",btohqsg
oh yea not talking about building like sembcorp headquarters ah,btohqsg
im talking about buildings like this,btohqsg
Oh that is for garbage collecting?,btohqsg
idk what tf she tryna do in these places,btohqsg
anyways i look at the map and just directed her onto a bus,btohqsg
*suddenly rmb one 2010s Channel 8 drama about a woman going to these places to find a handphone  it was the finale episode*,btohqsg
i got a sneaky feeling she taking a illicit package,btohqsg
Possibly finding scraps but other than that,btohqsg
yea ok then it's creepy. that age diff with how young you are and no context,btohqsg
The classic.Did you forget to eat your medicine?,btohqsg
nah it was that specific garbage collection building,btohqsg
but it was a pinpoint/waymarker to a very direct one,btohqsg
and it was nowhere near where we were,btohqsg
i was in ubi  the waymarker was in the vacinity of sengkang,btohqsg
That is very far off hahahaha,btohqsg
NAH..thats why i directed her onto a bus that basically stops at main road,btohqsg
Kinda glad that was the end of it,btohqsg
no shit any further you will be on the verge of certain assault or stalking,btohqsg
I'm not local so hopefully not,btohqsg
The whole time I was thinking u have such established job why can't find gf,btohqsg
i am going to say tho  its increasing prevalent of young people asking for numbers of strangers or socials in public,btohqsg
i mean individual things about the incident are ok just that when put them together it raises alarm bells,btohqsg
the sales people acosting people outside shops skills are coming out at full display,btohqsg
Yeah I even saw there was a community on tiktok to practice hitting on girls,btohqsg
yea no..thats just complete rage bait kind of post fr,btohqsg
nothing wrong with shooting his shot but if he dk you at all AND he's that much older then it'll obv creep people out,btohqsg
plus how he went on about his job screams bad vibes,btohqsg
"there is actually a well interesting technique from one of those ""how to date"" vids lmao i actually find it reasonably works cause you wont cause any girls any probs...basically just start a convo and end the convo by you giving your phone number or socials and walking away lolz",btohqsg
so if the other party indeed is interested..they will pursue..if not no harm no foul just forget the socials/phone number,btohqsg
Shit gotta sleep tmr gotta intern. Eh u doing internship rn also rite,btohqsg
The job thing was just part of the conversation though  not that he bragged about it or sth. But personally it didn't feel creepy at the moment  just when u think the situation all over again afterwards,btohqsg
that job portion was prob just so that he could talk to you about something,btohqsg
idk maybe he was just shooting his shot then  just that the age makes it extra off putting,btohqsg
I don't understand why people don't do this more instead of asking for their contact,btohqsg
because rejection is hard pill to swallow,btohqsg
i don't see an issue with asking for contact either in general,btohqsg
Sometimes when u ask instead of give ur contact we feel kinda obliged like what if he doesn't take rejection nicely  what if he stalks  etc,btohqsg
this how mis com happens...the girl is alr put in a place,btohqsg
thats the prob with asking for contacts or socials,btohqsg
the issue isn't about oh why can't one side do this,btohqsg
it's just one side expects a certain form of communication from the other,btohqsg
expecting the other person to just drop their handle is the same thing,btohqsg
asking for a request is literally how alot of miscoms happen in sales for example,btohqsg
no but its the way of communication,btohqsg
you cant just randomly ask someone on the spot to answer something they dont expect,btohqsg
that's only bc of the kind of society we are in,btohqsg
it's not a matter of the question,btohqsg
by the kind of society  i mean like sg,btohqsg
yes the question itself is not the prob but its the way how communication is established is the issue,btohqsg
you can literally ask anything but as long as the way you first establish communication creates tension..you alr ended the convo,btohqsg
my issue is that one side can be more careful to not put the person on the spot  while the other has to respond properly as well,btohqsg
you can't expect someone to start it a certain way and not know how to deal with it otherwise,btohqsg
how can someone not know how to react when they are given information...they literally either follow through or ignore. there is no basis that will give them any other choices,btohqsg
In sg I think random conversations with strangers aren't common and so it raises alarm instead of receiving it nicely,btohqsg
that's part of my point lol,btohqsg
you can't make blanket statements about the entire thing,btohqsg
they are common  just not for youths,btohqsg
Either ways u are also emphasising contextual discretion when it comes to such occurrences. There is and would be no fully correct action and what he did per say wasn't illegal or rise to the standard of a reportable action,btohqsg
the elderly have no prob doing that..thats why they can easily interact with other elderlies no issues,btohqsg
i think it's foolish to just assume there's always a specific way one should act,btohqsg
and a specific way you should start this sort of convo,btohqsg
so its not sg context..its a generational context,btohqsg
that is basically what im saying,btohqsg
Some places have it worse imo. The US has a culture of random cat calling of woman which I personally find deplorable,btohqsg
Does it rise to an illegal action,btohqsg
because if you realise..verbal threats in the US are mostly not followed through at all,btohqsg
that is the byproduct of free speech,btohqsg
it does not matter the threats are aimed at who...they are almost never follow through by authorities..you can have a guy threatening verbally a women  a employee threatening a boss  a kid threatening a teacher..etc  nothing happens,btohqsg
Yeah.. I won't trust that especially with a place that had access to guns like candy in a toy store.,btohqsg
yea idk i heard up until recently they sold shotguns at walmarts,btohqsg
i think the concept of shooting one's shot is just lost when you make blanket statements comparing it to sales lol,btohqsg
it really depends on how you approach the stranger and what tone/intention you have though,btohqsg
ive had strangers talk to me just cos of my shirt,btohqsg
Yeah sales has a clear economic motive to it,btohqsg
It is not an apples to apples comparison for that.,btohqsg
I have had ppl walk up to me and just commented on my height very common tbh,btohqsg
i alr mentioned its not about what is talked about..its how its conversed. sales  marketing..customer/employee. you can apply the same method of communication anywhere and it wont fly.elderlies cant bring the same communication from other elderlies to a sales person for example. my example of sales was just to show that its all the same kinds of communication starter,btohqsg
how you deliver + the content of what you say,btohqsg
so you are saying that a elderly acting aggressive and pushy towards another elderly will receive the same reaction as them acting aggressive and pushy towards a sales person,btohqsg
if you approached a girl nicely to compliment her and be cute about it i'm sure she'll be happy but if you do it with a weird inflection and language she'll pickup on that,btohqsg
Sales is an entirely different context and reason for conversation that makes it incompatible as a comparison.,btohqsg
casual conversation is not the same as sales dawg,btohqsg
why do i need a context or reason...when i can literally replace sales with anything else,btohqsg
from your ig i can't tell if you're surviving well,btohqsg
how many people trying to sell you something on the street do you ignore,btohqsg
If I am not doing intern with other styff,btohqsg
how many strangers that approach you do you ignore,btohqsg
Sales is not a boogeyman u can attribute everything to. That's literally what Si Yan was trying to say too u can't just blanket something,btohqsg
But sadly I did too many stuff,btohqsg
and what im saying is..im not blanketing that to a context. im using that as a example that could just be replaced with any other context,btohqsg
when a salesperson approaches you you already have a perception of them and that turns you awaya stranger approaching you in friendly mannerisms wouldnt provide that perception and you'd be far more open,btohqsg
lmao nvm..ill never articulate my point enough,btohqsg
yall keep pushing it like its supposedly the main point which i alr said its not,btohqsg
I mean is technically lab work  is not rlly stressful,btohqsg
The stressful part comes from doing too many other things on the side,btohqsg
Half half  depends on who you working with,btohqsg
yea the perception is them selling me something..but what the sales im talking about is you as a customer going up to them,btohqsg
Waa not bad leh. U did your first journal yet?,btohqsg
thats not fucking sales dawg thats called customer service...,btohqsg
Honestly  I saw the journal.I have no idea what to write,btohqsg
so you go to fairprice..you want to ask where is the rice. you call customer service,btohqsg
Is the same shit rite what did u notice in your company culture that shit,btohqsg
I don't get it at all tbh,btohqsg
Who do i ask for this haahahhaah,btohqsg
Ya but like  business model stump me tho,btohqsg
They are the ones who is gonna mark it,btohqsg
yes...? you as a customer literally ask the person working there a question and they provide you assistance,btohqsg
Oh fun fact  we dont know our faculty supervisor,btohqsg
I just got assigned on Friday-Sat,btohqsg
That one is u send to your boss,btohqsg
Uh but i laze sia hahahaha,btohqsg
They should send u an email depends on faculty,btohqsg
ok what im basically saying is thatcustomer is giving information to a salespersoncivillian is giving information to another civiliian.the salesperson or civillian can ignore,btohqsg
Bro that one I think is due next week or smth,btohqsg
so there is no context..that has to be met for my argument to be used,btohqsg
why would a customer give information to a salesperson,btohqsg
isnt it supposed to be in reverse,btohqsg
my brother in christ that is called a request not a provision of information,btohqsg
They can't ignore tho  it's their job,btohqsg
or even more simply a questiob,btohqsg
If only sales was that easy I sell car just can filter out by their salary immediately by asking em,btohqsg
ngl this sales analogy got even worse after seeing it's customer going up to salesperson,btohqsg
I can sense the frustration lol,btohqsg
i mean its up to you to decide ah..but for me i dont see any difference..cause ive seen sales people ignore customers b4,btohqsg
Yeah it's not an example because the roles are flipped,btohqsg
They say the faculty thing they will send arnd week 3 tho,btohqsg
i was gonna use this chat to procrastinate mt assignment and i regret it,btohqsg
welcome to my life...cant articulate for shit,btohqsg
Rn they consolidating all the faculty and assigning you ideally is 10 students to 1 faculty,btohqsg
in what parallel universe is a request (asking for information) the same as giving someone information,btohqsg
yea maybe i should not use sales,btohqsg
how did u pass english olevel,btohqsg
Ok i saw my faculty supervisor,btohqsg
Cuz U need them to mark Journal 1 which is DUE week 3,btohqsg
hha funny i did not actually,btohqsg
fkin useless english o levels use sec 2 comprehension techniques that nobody expected,btohqsg
Somehow I think u might have missed that lesson entirely,btohqsg
who tf does tys and expect o levels to come out a whole comprehension question targeted at what you learnt in sec 2,btohqsg
not too familiar but p chill biophysics guy,btohqsg
if you as a sec 4 cant apply sec 2 techniques should you really be blaming the paper,btohqsg
you dont go into o levels expecting the whole comprehension to test you on sec 2,btohqsg
Lol....when you project abt magnetism but he deals with bio,btohqsg
because they have never done that in tys,btohqsg
literally my year was the year they did not even have a cause and effect question for o levels,btohqsg
Later he be bringing his children to the presentation hahahahha,btohqsg
if your knowledge of english is strictly from TYS i think you need to read more,btohqsg
anyway tldr there's no one right way to shoot your shot with someone but there's a fuck ton of wrong ways,btohqsg
"Sounds like a ""you"" problem to me",btohqsg
HOW DID IT GO INTO SALES,btohqsg
every 6 yrs moe changes their topics..idk if its still the same now  thats the only scam of tys,btohqsg
but then they also recycle questions which is the good part of tys,btohqsg
uh it started from someone asking if this one occurrence was creepy lol,btohqsg
bro comprehension is one fucking paper,btohqsg
dont use it as an excuse,btohqsg
you wouldve at least gotten a B/C,btohqsg
Precisely why we said the example doesn't fucking work,btohqsg
i was uninformed of the promot,btohqsg
lmao..yea i know it aint only that paper..but i would have least past,btohqsg
aiya o lvl gonna be gone üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,btohqsg
im curious as to how itll work,btohqsg
i used the wrong example ok,btohqsg
WTF RHEYRE USING GPA FOR SEC SCHOOL,btohqsg

maybe idk..i think ive said before. i did not care about my studies in sec school,btohqsg
reddit actually..at least you dont see nsfw shit on discord as often as reddit,btohqsg
