In any dispute  CSO verbal words against tnc black and white words. Which will carry weight? Have to keep a record of the conversation.,btohqsg
UOB big savings payout- hi gurus  if I registered for 150k fresh funds on 1st May.. can I split the deposit of 150k into 3 times at different dates within May itself? It will still count towards as the incremental  fresh funds rite?,btohqsg
Yes my former appeal was based on i needed clarification for the interpretation of the tnc hence i went down to the branch. The officer tending to me went to check with the manager n i have both person name. At the end they gave me the reward.,btohqsg
Yes but your own MAB will be affected,btohqsg
Not the highest. There is UOB EVOL (8% of $250 online)  also UOB One.,btohqsg
Thx then i stick to uob one,btohqsg
Oki.. since I’ll only have my money back at different dates on May no choice,btohqsg
Hi all  when does ocbc 360 take snapshot of bank balance to calculate MAB? Have 97k MAB now and was thinking to increase it to closer to 100k  but nor sure when to take out  also am concerned on the labour day holiday next day if thats any issue,btohqsg
End of day  check statement to be accurate,btohqsg
Any1 received this email? I only received notification but no email,btohqsg
Just to confirm  if i top up today and withdraw tomorrow… PH wouldnt have effect on the MAB right i would assume? ie. 1 May day end balance wouldnt take 30 Apr day end balance because of the PH right?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGif is freelancer  how to get the salary interest for OCBC 360 account?,btohqsg
1 May balance will take 30 Apr balance because of PH.,btohqsg
What i did was open my own company to pay myself,btohqsg
Open own company  get corporate bank account  pay yourself,btohqsg
The amount u play with must be big enough to be worth since there is cost involved with acra etc,btohqsg
What's the min to open corporate bank account?,btohqsg
I can only share old info since what i did was in the past,btohqsg
1k to open but no min balance. Cost invoked is more like paying acra bizfile etc and also annual filing depending on whether u setting up pte ltd or LLP or the other solo one i forgot the term,btohqsg
Im semi retired now so pardon my old info,btohqsg
Anyway heard now pte ltd can be solo also.. Last time cannot solo for pte ltd,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I hv participate in this promo 100K for uob stash instead coz my adb is 1k for Mar. For Uob one acc  can I check whether I should pump in 50K today (100k alr earmark for earlier promo) or on 2 May to get full eir 4% for 150K? Thanks!,btohqsg
If you put in 2-May wont that be 1 day short in May. You dont expect MAB to be 150k for May right? So you should put today since tomm is PH,btohqsg
Just curious if stashaway simple plus is also a good option as they don’t require to keep the fund for a fixed period. Although from past experience  they are very slow in returning the fund back to the bank account.,btohqsg
I wont able to put in today so for some of us in the similar situation  I will register again in May and put the 50k end of May. You will still get the bonus but later.,btohqsg
stashaway is different from GXS account.  One is an investment with risk and the other is bank account which is SDIC insured. So what are you comparing?,btohqsg
Thanks  but my funds in EGA so thinking whether worthwhile to do it  EGA promo is for Apr n May,btohqsg

Hi  can I just check  is there a way to “convert” insurance spending into other kind of spending?Like for example  sometimes credit card run promotions for retail spending. And they specifically exclude insurance spending. So I want to convert insurance spending into eligible retail spending,btohqsg
CardUp. But still depends on the promo/card exclusions.,btohqsg
"What is ""this promo"" referring to?",btohqsg
the base was 1.5% previously right?,btohqsg
The uob acc promotion  you can check it out,btohqsg
So you already registered 100k for UOB Stash underTHISpromo? And you want to register 50k for UOB One account underTHISpromo?,btohqsg
Nope  just want to get eir rate of 4% as Uob change their interest rate rules from May onwards,btohqsg
Oh. Your original message not clear. Just make sure it's 150k today or 155k on 2 May.,btohqsg
