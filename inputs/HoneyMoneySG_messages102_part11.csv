Probably new to cardup with some promo?,btohqsg
Last time got use. So got research a bit. You can go hardwarezone or what to search. Quite technical I don't know how to explain.,btohqsg
You might be confusing their 2Gbps plans with the 10 Gbps one.,btohqsg
No. Didn't confuse. Their are not 10gbps upload. Remember have some limit with upload,btohqsg
For uob promo  do u register first or deposit amount first?,btohqsg
Mostly Groceries and grab food - a bit of transport.,btohqsg
I am more familiar with miles earning cards.Your spending patterns should yield you most miles through UOB lady's card  pick categories 'transport' and 'family'.Earns 4MPD  (up to $2 000 per month)For cashback  will need other experts' advice,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone has experience with using syfe cash+ flexi usd with projected interested up to 5.3%? Wonder if i can use my sgd n if capital is guaranteed just like a fix deposit?,btohqsg
This is an investment and therefore capital is not guaranteed,btohqsg
Tks. Do u know we can use sgd?,btohqsg
My HSBC EGA was just opened on 17 April. Can you help to answer my 2 queries below:1. Based on HSBC T&C  do you know if my reference month will be April 2024 and the incremental ADB will only be applicable on 1 May 2024?2. Am I right to say the bonus interest will be applied to the incremental ADB monthly until we move the money? Meaning the incremental ADB on the month of May will earn bonus interest in May  June  July onwards until we move the money or HSBC changed their T&C again.Thanks for your help.,btohqsg
1. Firstly  I assume you have sms to register for the Apr bonus interest promo.2. For Apr promo  reference month is March  and your March ADB balance is $0 (Bec acct not open yet)3. Your account balance will earn bonus interest (3.5%) for Apr and May.To get another +1%  u need to fulfill and qualify for the everyday reward plus programme.,btohqsg
1. reference month Mar $0 if register for promo in Apr2. This promo only give bonus interest for April and May ADB. Thereafter need to see the terms of any new promo.,btohqsg
Yes  I did registered by SMS to qualify for the promo.To qualify for the additional bonus interest of 1% basically I just need to do fast transfer from my HSBC account to my DBS account 5 times right? Based on the T&C above,btohqsg
yes  assuming u transferred in $5k/$2k. Note that the 1% is on the incremental ADB wrt previous month,btohqsg

Right now with hsbc pooling their points  is it good to get hsbc travelone for lounge access and bonus miles? I already had hsbc revo card.,btohqsg
LOL confirm confused liao.The limit is only applicable to their 2Gbps (2Gbps down  1Gbps up) due to equipment limitation (they're using the same ont as 1Gbps)10 Gbps by all accounts seem to be symmetrical (did your research for youhttps://www.singtel.com/personal/products-services/broadband/singtel-symmetrical-broadband),btohqsg
anyone tried heya phoneline? is it good?,btohqsg
But to answer this question. 10GBps is gonna be as reliable as 1Gbps. They all use the same back end stuff if  a Telco internet go down it won't care 10Gbps or 1Gbps.Reliability also would be determined by locale sometimes so you can maybe ask your neighbor if they have Singtel what's their exp been like.If youre changing for gaming reasons  recently Singtel gives me almost 200ms ping to my game SG server with a wired lan connection which is ridiculous. But for most other browsing it's okay. Do note if you using wifi that might be another source of your woes,btohqsg
1. Reference month March ($0)2. Earn full 3.x% interest for April and may. Depend on your tier.3. Earn full 1% on your April because incremental against March is full.4. May 1% is only on may against April incremental balance.,btohqsg

What is the heymax card maxisier,btohqsg
An auto sync feature to track your card spend. More details later,btohqsg
True  but 10gbps I heard there is a special infrastructure that is being used that’s why netlink trust need to come down change cable all these for older buildings,btohqsg

For IRAS property and personal income payments  should I put them under GIRO or card recurring payment?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I know how strict is it to apply UOB lady solitaire with less than 120k min income?,btohqsg
This year is very strict. Even with more than 100k you can't.,btohqsg
Either is fine. It depends on what card you're using and if you prefer miles or cashback.,btohqsg

No. Maybe there is changes. Anyway last time I go with superinternet cuz of after research. Of course don't really recommend unless you have some usage at work or what. Normal plan shld be sufficient for most use case,btohqsg
No ah... Fibre can handle 10gbps no issue de. The only thing to change likely is ont.,btohqsg
