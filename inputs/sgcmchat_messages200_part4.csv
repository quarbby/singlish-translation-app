E63 bodykitted are the worst offenders,btohqsg
"i've seen at least 4 ""E63s""",btohqsg
and holy shit the upbadging is unreal,btohqsg
i've seen a ton of these lately with the quad tip exhausts and all. but its quite easy to tell most of them from the rear tire width,btohqsg
"imo the quad tips are ""fine"" bah",btohqsg
but the bodykit is really overkill liao,btohqsg
problem is they have the badges too,btohqsg
most have 255 all round tyres from factory,btohqsg
and the rear tires look like 235s to me. dead fucking giveaway,btohqsg
iinw alot chose 245s because cheep,btohqsg
275s on a low spec merc would be pretty damn overkill tho,btohqsg
did you say it was an e250?,btohqsg
even then i think its a bit much but acceptable i guess,btohqsg
wide tires on the rear do look good though,btohqsg
"22R18"" LT ALLOY WHEEL 5 DOUBLE-SPOKE DES. MIXED TIRES",btohqsg
would be cool if the bot can check road tax paid or not. a lot of clowns running around with road tax unpaid. i think the onemotoring site can tell you this without being the owner,btohqsg
worst offender i've seen didn't pay road tax for about a year,btohqsg
imagine a lancerlution or fake f2dr with expired road tax. send straight to the firing squad,btohqsg
Yeah can  I omitted it since the main goal is to check the model. The data is on the same page,btohqsg
bro  add that feature in. lol,btohqsg
Go easy guys before lta ban my IP ðŸ’€,btohqsg

there was a massive flood on SLE twd BKE aft upp thomson entrance,btohqsg
i blew through it and saw my covers floating away,btohqsg

bro i thought u were gonna say dj vendetta,btohqsg
Spotted the new M5 in Simei,btohqsg
Tbh looks much better in person,btohqsg
mattheusdo u know how legends are made,btohqsg
wow didn't know so fast sia!,btohqsg
holy shit someone was actually dumb enough to buy one,btohqsg
overweight  horrible efficiency  looks terrible  and a lotus basically built by geely,btohqsg
geely knows their brand is shit so they basically bought lotus and stuck the lotus badge on what is basically a shit tier chinese EV. i'm grateful at least they let lotus build the emira but make no mistake this is basically a fancier BYD with a lotus badge on it for a lot more money,btohqsg
is that a requirement to post an opinion on a car?,btohqsg
because if so then 95% do not have the right to comment on any car,btohqsg
u shouldâ€¦.  its actually a decent carâ€¦,btohqsg
well all i can say is you're entitled to your opinion,btohqsg
overweight  ugly  owned by geely and the absolutely terrible efficiency are all objective by the way  and not opinions,btohqsg
i just asked if u drive it before,btohqsg
and you countered facts with your own little opinion? ok,btohqsg
it is when the majority of people feel that way,btohqsg
omg the two overlords are fighting,btohqsg
hello haha no boss just worker,btohqsg
sounds like someone recently bought an eletre and is feeling a little butthurt,btohqsg
but hey as long as you like it  why get triggered over what i say right,btohqsg
i wish i had an eletreâ€¦ i only take bmw,btohqsg
which part am i triggered do lmk,btohqsg
the part where you say its a decent car when i gave you factual reasons why its crap,btohqsg
