@its_shxnhow did u score so high in Getaway?,btohqsg
Your take home should be 20% of the 10/h,btohqsg
Employer 17% is on top of the 10/h that you're getting,btohqsg
for 10/h  8/h but ur CPF should be getting 3.7/h,btohqsg
HahaMy technique is that you should do turn (recommend do a sharp turn) only when the police car is about 60m away from youYou should keep doing sharp turn only in one direction as much as possibleE.g. First time turn is right side  then subsequent turn should also be right sideUnless there's one police car suddenly in front of you  then you can turn in another directionSo  yeahIt's not so easyThis one need more practiceEnjoy playing the game :),btohqsg

Tower Transit - The Transcab of buses.,btohqsg
the bus involved was ex-SMRT btw,btohqsg
Yes. They haven’t paint it over.,btohqsg
it operated on many buses when it was on SMRT,btohqsg
svc 169 965 969 and many more,btohqsg
then when that bus was shifted to TTS  it operated on svc 853 for quite some time and now svc 969,btohqsg
I see.. That ‘s a demo bus. The seating is better than similar units that ‘s roaming on the road.,btohqsg
it's actually sg's 1st SMRT double decker  which had to crash tdy,btohqsg

all double decker buses are <4.5m,btohqsg
maybe the driver think he driving a single decker into the taxi stand,btohqsg
Or maybe he doesn't know that the bus that he's driving is taller than the height of the ceiling,btohqsg
he's 63 years old maybe he's half awake while driving?,btohqsg
What kind of math is this,btohqsg
its stats but in a different notation,btohqsg
