They will chopped only at whenever the fairprice you redeemed voucher at. So where u redeem will be where you have to use.,btohqsg
Imagine if dbs is mentioned it because chris mentioned him thinking dbs really watches the video (which i think they are) 😂,btohqsg
They know the hack themselves. Just whether they want to keep it to maintain more customer acquisition,btohqsg
Cardup requires you to pay  fees in return of miles  is it worth? Can someone send the link to check the amt paid versus the miles received?,btohqsg
😁 The government will be disbursing 600 000 S$30 public transport vouchers to help lower- to lower-middle income households cope with the fare adjustment.➡️https://bit.ly/3EDT0DZFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
I don't think so can withdraw one lump sum. If not  it paves the way for people treating CPF like a fixed deposit.,btohqsg
I think here mostly above the household income. Don't really benefit at all,btohqsg
Sigh of all things i missed out that detail,btohqsg
thank you  will read it up in detail,btohqsg
Dear credit card experts  if you have to leave Singapore and stay overseas for a minimum of 2-3 years. which credit card will you choose and how will you maximize the benefits of either the mileage or cashback programs?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!,btohqsg
use Amaze... CC depends on your usage patterns... i think Maybank F&F is good for cashback.. miles should be the standard just get 4x miles for online spend,btohqsg
Hi all  I saw some messages to use Amex > grab for insurance premiums. Is this only for 1st installment payment? Coz my insurance agent all told me that I cant use grabpay or credit cards for recurring insurance premiums payment. Seek some clarity and advise pls.,btohqsg
Need to pay manually. I pay for 2 mths at 1 go. for prudential.,btohqsg
If me I might apply the overseas CC and focus on cashback.,btohqsg
Hey  can I know how to maximize miles to have the equivalent to 5-6% cashback?,btohqsg
I thought about this before. My plan is to use miles card so that I can redeem ticket home whenever possible.,btohqsg
Grab card can be use at axs,btohqsg
Accumulate and then sell to other by booking flight for them,btohqsg
Sia give bonus miles at time for redemption,btohqsg
Oh so its to pay thru AXS using grabpay,btohqsg
Ok tks  will go and try it out,btohqsg
agreeed those beneifts is those very very low income,btohqsg
eh... for HDB BTO this one no hack right 😂,btohqsg
You can ask the HDB officer if they let you tap NETS Flashpay $500 per card,btohqsg
What card do you use to top up the flashpay?,btohqsg
Oh...but how do you top FP via CC?,btohqsg
Hey guys does instarem amaze + Citi rewards work with Kris+?Meaning we can earn up to 4 + 9 miles per dollar,btohqsg
hi  i have an online purchase of about USD 1k (overseas website)  is the citibank cashback+ 1.6% & amaze bonus 1% the best way to transact this?,btohqsg
maybe  unless it is under a mcc that get higher rewards on specialised cards,btohqsg
i see. Also realised that the amaze with fx spread of 0.3%  and if instapoints capped at 500 points/transaction (i cant split my USD 1.1k/roughly SGD 1.5k so effectively bonus cashback is only about 0.33%)  basically my bonus cashback is nullified  correct? 😅,btohqsg
Check out the Kris+ app  basically u pay with Google Pay on it so u earn miles on ur card AND on the Kris+ app itself,btohqsg
I don't think its 4MPD.. Other chats have recommended using HSBC revolution on it tho,btohqsg
Can explain more why it will not earn 4mpd? I've read very differing views on this also,btohqsg
I don't think there's a definite answer out there for amaze since there's mixed answers from what I've been observing  but at least using CRMC directly  won't provide u w 4mpdhttps://milelion.com/2022/10/09/krisshop-10-10-deal-earn-up-to-14-5-mpd-on-all-purchases/,btohqsg
think kris data base got hacked ?https://www.marketing-interactive.com/krisshop-phishing-data-breachafter u google seem like happen quitte often,btohqsg
because you will not earn anything on CRMC if you make payments through Google/ApplePay. using amaze does not bypass that fact.Since Kris+ only accepts payment through Google/ApplePay.... hence it won't get the 4mpd,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to use youtrip or revolut on axs payment before?,btohqsg
Any suggestions for retail transaction to hit min spend of $500 on citibank cashback + card  i have to spend a few hundred before the time limit is up in a few days.,btohqsg
What are some types of vouchers i can get?,btohqsg
Amaze bypass that and can get 4mpd,btohqsg
at least u save on fx fees and still get 1.6%,btohqsg
Really? I was told that I can't put amaze+crmc on Google pay becuz it won't bypass. Have been avoiding it cuz ive see multiple advices on this,btohqsg
Hi gurus  quite new to this credit card stacking thing. Anyone uses the ezlink Mastercard? Is it good? I’m currently using Citibank cashback+ cos I’m a low spender and don’t always hit the $500 in monthly spending.,btohqsg
CRMC need to avoid in-app apple/google payAmaze on google pay is ok because the google pay is outside of the Amaze App.CRMC on Kris+ is not ok because the google pay is in Kris+ app.Does that make it clearer?,btohqsg
Right ok thanks all... Cuz I've always been told amaze doesn't bypass Google pay issue for crmc,btohqsg
https://blog.seedly.sg/grabrewards-grab-points-changes/Today last day Liao grab game over,btohqsg
I'm going to sign up uob absolute CC  does anyone know the sign up bonus of $1200 spend include grab wallet top up as well?,btohqsg

Do take note tomorrow on wards grab point got nerf,btohqsg
