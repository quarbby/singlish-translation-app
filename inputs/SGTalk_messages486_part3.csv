I’ve waited for this day since 7 years ago,btohqsg
I prefer those crowded subway or lonely housewives plot de,btohqsg
The place they always complain or gossip,btohqsg
Ehh sia la I read wrong,btohqsg
I not sure  if the actors are right and story is good I will watch  iykwim  like sometime the actor and the character ta match,btohqsg
but dunno lei sometime I watch those romance ones I feel too sad to watch till the end hahahaha,btohqsg
I think he meant different plots,btohqsg
Although I should be sleeping 🤣,btohqsg
I think she’s paid to said this 😂😂,btohqsg
must be a kpop fan 🤣,btohqsg
Yea I dun trust that reviews anymore 😢,btohqsg
See the place they share then I go check google review myself,btohqsg
but google reviews nowadays also sus 🙈 I went to a place few weeks ago  it was so bad I had to give bad review then realized a lot of people also bad experience 🤣 their rating 2.6 only BUTJust 2 weeks later suddenly a lot of foreign account all give 5 stars lol bumped them to 4. Something,btohqsg
first time I see a noodle place give you one piece of vegetable  like literally one piece lol,btohqsg
K dramas have similar plot lines among each other making it predictable or boring down the line and kinda unrealistic in real life situations I mean ya it can be nice but saying that it “can help people reconnect with their own emotions or process trauma giving the shows a healing power” is a lil excessive,btohqsg
To me I just feel it’s bias cause every country also got drama ! So specifically picking out kdrama is kinda 🤣,btohqsg
whether got healing power or what ever I leave it to the viewers ba,btohqsg
She’s American Born Korean so could be why also,btohqsg
but to be fair  kdramas is still the current trend I guess,btohqsg
Wonder who will take over next !,btohqsg
I rarely watch it and didn’t watch squid games😅,btohqsg
I love Thai movies especially their horrors,btohqsg
china probably not so soon ba although they have quite some good shows nowadays  but some of their actors ideal of beauty is too cringed for my liking lol like the guys skinny till the wind blow will fly de lol,btohqsg
Thai actually all along is there one but just not main stream I guess,btohqsg
I like their comedies kind hahahaha,btohqsg
wonder if one day singapore will ever rise up ~~~,btohqsg
But we have too few people Liao I guess,btohqsg
I think possible but I think we won’t watch our own people’s movies unless it’s good,btohqsg
that’s the issue  honestly I dunno lei I tried watching but just feels so meh lol,btohqsg
And the competition is big but small market,btohqsg
I’m not a big fan of some local shows like sunny side up,btohqsg
yea  I dunno but I just feel local show something is missing,btohqsg
good looking people? Good actors with good acting skills? Good story or plot ? I dunno  I just cannot resonate with singapore shows lol,btohqsg
See Liao sometime will feel cringed even 🤣,btohqsg
The acting skills and story plot mehhhhh,btohqsg
But some peoples acting skills zhat zhat,btohqsg
yea like when you see their crying scene  your tears will auto activate de,btohqsg

How to make millions before grandma dies got me crying,btohqsg

True but the Nyonya show is good,btohqsg
