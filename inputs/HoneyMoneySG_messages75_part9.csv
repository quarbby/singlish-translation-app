Im keen to do RSP and Iâ€™m using moomoo platform. How do I RSP for S&P 500? All I see is funds like Allianz Income   Fidelity Funds etc,btohqsg
HL Bank 3.6% for 12 months,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s always VOO or SPY which replicates S&P 500,btohqsg
Ohhh  I thought you meant stashaway EIR is 3%.,btohqsg
My bad. I thought it's uob stash,btohqsg
Ok but what I mean is.. I wanna do DCA after watching Chrisâ€™s video ðŸ˜‚ but Iâ€™m using moomoo instead of webull.. so I try to look for RSP plan but all are about funds not allowing me to pick my own stock or ETF ðŸ˜… not sure if I make any sense,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think moomoo has rsp options. Only webull,btohqsg
