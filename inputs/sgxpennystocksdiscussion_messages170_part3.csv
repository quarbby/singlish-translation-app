For Renasisance United (formerly IPCO)   believe once they flush out the sellers 0.002 and 0.003 . this one might get interesting. If BBs decide to take out 0.003 (big stack) this one can run. Has been in my freezer for the longest time. Hope can,btohqsg

Addvaltech $0.023 is a good entry level given its placement at $0.02385. Addvaltech has manage to bring in Alan Wang or known as Wang Yu Huei or Asdew. Management has signal in its 14 Nov announcement that it is positive going forward for its IDRS business. Bid Ask Price Action happen to see 2 big queue 12m at 24 and 10m 25  so I supported some 23.,btohqsg
