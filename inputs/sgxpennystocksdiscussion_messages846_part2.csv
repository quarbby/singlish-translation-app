Other possible signs of the end times would include a rebuilding of a Jewish temple in Jerusalem  increased hostility toward Israel  and advances toward a one-world government. The most prominent sign of the end times  however  is the nation of Israel itself. In 1948  Israel was recognized as a sovereign state  essentially for the first time since AD 70. God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8)  and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37). Having Israel as a nation in its own land is important in light of end-times prophecy because of Israel’s prominence in eschatology (Daniel 10:14; 11:41; Revelation 11:8).,btohqsg
