Being a fabulous human is expensive,btohqsg

Dont need to deal with Singaporeans as much,btohqsg
True la needa have a level of calibre also if not its gonna be a struggle even with money,btohqsg
Yeah  they're teachers are good (mostly) and don't need to spend so much money,btohqsg
"So you're telling me your friend wants to part with 50k per year just so he can ""deal with Singaporeans less""?",btohqsg
Not only is he stupid but also hes going to what hea trying to run away from,btohqsg
There’s nothing in an international school worth 50k a year,btohqsg
People who r willing to pay don’t really see 50k as a lot,btohqsg
If he's Singaporean  he's running towards NS in the end too,btohqsg
U are talking abt tanglin int trust sch,btohqsg
Money makes money i guess. But if u dont have a character ull actually end up getting bullied,btohqsg
Their other 20k is for international trips and miscellaneous,btohqsg

What if youre the heir to some big company,btohqsg
Ur friends will be as shallow as wealthy u r then,btohqsg
