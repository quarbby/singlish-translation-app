Later evening shld b better. Holiday eve will have more orders. Hopefully ü§£,btohqsg
I dunno if anyone go thru cb period...no stacking..1 time slot within 55mjns 1 order..got what take what..,btohqsg
No stacking cos lack of orders/ too many couriers? Or mandated by llm?,btohqsg
I sent to pasir panjang outside the gate wont even think abt secure ..policd cantonment outside gate..,btohqsg
The TOS is pretty clear  PU or DO to these addresses have a secure zone fee  how the transaction is conducted is btw u and the sender/receiver. Doesnt matter if it is gate or 25 floors up.If the user is not the end receiver  there is no wrong in asking.,btohqsg
There are things no need to be so calculative..got order better than no orders..outside camp/police station/habour office..as long not mafan to changr pass no need secure zone fees...thats my opinion,btohqsg
Inidvidial ..cause if never go thru the cb period ..u dont know the pain of hanging ard to bid for jobs..waste more time LL than send orders,btohqsg
Now stack orders most sender dont complain if we abit late..quite hosay ..,btohqsg
Hope don't cb again  if nope die,btohqsg
