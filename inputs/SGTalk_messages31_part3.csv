I use the wordbasicallyto suggest that it will be reduced to the level of a seasonal flu shot,btohqsg
I remember hearing about a S'pore travel bubble with Australia and Hong Kong. Is that discussed at all with other ASEAN nations?,btohqsg
Anyone here know how to unlock Grab suspended account?,btohqsg
When is the bubble policy expected to end  or to expand to other countries,btohqsg
I don’t think other asean nations can reach the level of vaccination small cities like SG and HK can achieve  to be honest,btohqsg
So maybe australia gov won’t be so readily granting travel bubbles with other nationsThey are very strict  even forbidding their own citizens from flying back to Australia if they were in India,btohqsg
That's fair  most of ASEAN may have to wait on India,btohqsg
Since the US/Japan/Aus/India Quad arranged to send 1 billion doses to ASEAN  but that was interrupted by India's spike,btohqsg
I assume China and COVAX are helping provide shots too  but that 1 billion from the Quad would have made things go much faster,btohqsg
Interrupted because India was supposed to be the producer  but aren't shipping shots out now,btohqsg
Is India's spike winding down? I haven't kept track,btohqsg

"WHO approves SINOVAC but here are 3 things you should think about🤔1️⃣ WHO has approved vaccines with lower efficacy rates such as Sinovac  Johnson & Johnson  AstraZeneca/Oxford through COVAX emergency use listing  the global programme to provide vaccines to countries  which currently faces major supply problems. 💀💀For a start  countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating 💉 their health workers and populations at risk  contributing to the COVAX Facility's goal of equitable vaccine distribution "" said Dr Mariângela Simão  WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. 🌍🌍This actually means that the approval for a vaccine to be listed for emergency use is not actually a stamp of quality.😅🤯WHO is approving these vaccines to also allow them to be included in COVAX so that countries who have no access to vaccines (i.e. poor countries) can have them. For the WHO  it is better for these countries to have a vaccine than to have no protection at all.🆘🆘👉https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/who-approves-sinovacs-covid-19-vaccine2️⃣ Singapore 🇸🇬(and many other countries) have set a high 📊 which is currently more stringent than WHO's.SinoVac's efficacy rate is 51%.Some Singaporeans already choose Pfizer over Moderna because Pfizer is 1% better. Why do you want to settle for less and take something that's over 40% worse than our current options? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️HSA has already shared that it cannot approve Sinovac yet as its safety and efficacy data was incomplete.👉https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sinovac-vaccine-will-not-be-used-without-hsas-approval3️⃣Despite all this  Singapore still gives you the choice to take Sinovac if you die die still insist on it la. 🔆❣️If individuals wish to take it  they can do so via a private provider under the Special Access Route. (i. e. go private la)",btohqsg

🙋🏻Would you:🙋🏻‍♂️(1) Drive a car whose manufacturer has not submitted full details of the safety of its airbags? 🚗🚕🚙(2) Use an electrical appliance that has yet to achieve its electrical safety certification? ⚡🔌💡(3) Wear a condom whose maker has not revealed the full details of the clinical study behind its supposed effectiveness percentage? 😉💋💄If your answer isNO  then you should also understand why the Singapore government has yet to deploy Sinovac under our national vaccination programme. 💉😷💊Let's be clear.Singapore is not against any country  and we will use any vaccine as long as it is proven to be safe and effective.All vaccines  regardless of their country of origin  are subject to the same standards and degree of scrutiny.Big fan of Sinovac and want Sinovac to be deployed?🐼Well how about you lobby Sinovac to submit its outstanding data for HSA to complete its evaluation instead for inclusion into Singapore's national vaccination programme? After all  nothing to fear if there's nothing to hide. Them doing so would give you  the consumer  the ease of mind too. 😌🕊️✌️Tio bo?✅✅✅,btohqsg
