Sing saver vs money smart ?I don‚Äôt understand the claiming part esp money smart on how it works and also has anyone chosen the 300 cash reward from sing saver plus 150 Shopee vouchers(and Tnc for the Shopee vouchers ?)Is there any other better place to apply this card (Citi rewards) from ?,btohqsg
Anyone know I can find the card details for Citi platinum Mastercard?,btohqsg
Anyone have issue checking OCBC$ in internet banking?,btohqsg
Not familiar with this card. Is it Citi rewards master card?,btohqsg
Fine print is  need to hold funds for 60days  so if choosing SGD cash fund  then return may be is only:Assume sgd mmf is 3.3%pa 1.68%pa top up for 30days is like 0.84%pa for 60 days 3.3% + 0.84% = 4.14%pa for whole of 60daysOk this is a much lower promo compared to previous üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,btohqsg
Maybe my web browser issue  all other functions are okay  let me try other browsersThanks üôè,btohqsg
For OCBC360 credit card spending bonuses does paying insurance via AXS earn bonus interest?,btohqsg
Will I get 3mpd if I pair amaze with UOB KF for hertz or budget car rental?,btohqsg
I'm making payment at the car rental counter,btohqsg
Don't think the MCC is on UOB KF whitelist for 3mpd.,btohqsg
Any other good alternatives that can get higher interest than 4.14%?,btohqsg
Hsbc ega is one of them,btohqsg
Hi all  just wondering other than uob one  which other salary crediting account/bank supports self transfer? I read above ocbc360 requires salary crediting from a corporate account. Thank you.,btohqsg
Yeah all I can think of is hsbc and UOBAM cash +,btohqsg
UOB no need to do real salary crediting. You just transfer from another account into UOB account and put 'salary payment' as reason . Will be considered salary credit for the higher interest,btohqsg
Thank you! Yup indeed. Was wondering if there were any others that are similar to UOB in that regard and would not require corporate crediting.,btohqsg
Hi All  anybody use esim in Australia? I am doing comparison between klook and I find airalo is cheaper but unsure they will block certain app as online said it block tiktok. Thanks!,btohqsg
Sing saver vs money smart ?1. Has anyone used money smart on how it works2. has anyone chosen the 300 cash reward from sing saver plus 150 Shopee vouchers(any Tnc for the Shopee vouchers ?)Is there any other better place to apply this card (Citi rewards) from ?,btohqsg
Nope. I think it‚Äôs an old card that my parent is still using,btohqsg
Tough to help without a specific name for it. Does your parent have the Citi mobile app to check  or are you able to contact CSO about this?,btohqsg
I recall some old Citi card they removed from their website.,btohqsg
Still new to Amaze. Can any guru confirm that 25k points equates to 10k miles ? Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Correct. 10 points = 4 miles. But ya it's Citi Rewards you are referring to  not Amaze,btohqsg
Oops! Yes Citi. Paired with Amaze. Sorry  I wasn‚Äôt clear.,btohqsg
Seems like it was replaced with Citi Rewards Mastercard  but no idea if the rewards system is inherited or invalidated.Best to check with CSO.https://www1.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/manage-your-card/card-upgrade,btohqsg
Is ocbc revising the interest? Can't access the 360 account calculator,btohqsg
Just watched it  i saw he uses moomoo but i read comments saying that chris has advocated other apps too like IBKR. i'm just still unsure which is the best app to use thats all,btohqsg
Easy but costlier or cheaper but advanced  choose 1 of 2,btohqsg
So if I'm a existing moomoo user and want to join this promo  I should do this?-I should withdraw my money-Register the promo-Transfer back the money-Keep the money for 2months,btohqsg
Hi if i pair my amaze with my citi cc. Can i use my amaze card to do paynow transaction to collect miles point?,btohqsg
How u using amaze to do paynow?,btohqsg
oh sorry typo  i mean paywave payment. could i use amaze for paywave payment?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so cause there‚Äôs a monthly and quarterly min spend criteria,btohqsg
Citi Cash Back MC seems to be the closest equivalent(?) to this in that case,btohqsg
1). Have you read the TnC?2). Do you know what is the effective interest rate? (Not the advertised rate).3). Have you calculated your incremental fund based on closing balance on 05 Aug  10pm?,btohqsg
I just check its not a cashback cardIt‚Äôs legit a Citi platinum Mastercard,btohqsg
Just test with other browser have same issue,btohqsg
Only Rewards tab not loading  all others are okay,btohqsg
Oh i was checking stack rewards,btohqsg
Hi  i want to ask if I apply citi rewards CC through SingSavers as new citi CC member and get the rewards from singsavers  will it forfeit the 40 000miles rewards from Citibank? Thanks,btohqsg
is it normal that it is till 30SEP2024 instead of end-Aug?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows when you pay via atome does it based on the merchant mcc or atome mcc?,btohqsg
