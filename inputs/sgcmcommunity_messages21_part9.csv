Owner age or profile doesn't matter. Their attention towards the car and love/budget for it does. That's why proper knowledge and PPI is more important than just reading  meticulous owner  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
depends what model... Subaru is reliable...generally,btohqsg
more reliable than a jetta as Mr X mentioned,btohqsg

yeah. that is why i dont count rotary as a good car. i just compare pstons engined cars. major japanese brands are more or less reliable. actually i have water pump and fan motor replaced in the 4 years of having vios. other than that  the car starts on first crank. never failed!,btohqsg
Point being  all brands have their own share of reliability issues,btohqsg

pre 2000 alfa romeo is terrible. clutch failure multiple times  radiator failure  air conditioning failure  pipes failure  speeedo failure  door handles failure.... too many.many heard of horrible stories. But companies can change for the better and improved. just as hyundai improved without you knowing when the earlier sonata  matrix are craps. but why do many have different opinions about them? because they bother to check. for Alfa  no? not many users give them a second look. own it drive it and find out,btohqsg
