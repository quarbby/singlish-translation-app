I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a very good use of time to think about such things,btohqsg
So I donâ€™t count my marks and I donâ€™t try to figure out what the cut off mark for A is any year,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not a productive line of thought,btohqsg

I always overthink or become anxious,btohqsg
Like just last year for o lvls i had a dream or two about my results,btohqsg
Scoring decent as well as badly,btohqsg
Sadly i think knowing a rough cut off is helpful,btohqsg
I would  but i think about it  and rationally I know thereâ€™s nothing to be done any more  so I just let it go,btohqsg
I just ignore it all the way until results day,btohqsg
It is irrational to worry  so I do the rational thing,btohqsg

I know. Thats why i said Work for your future children  house  and lifestyle,btohqsg
You work now to pursue an endgoal. Do not work for the sake of working,btohqsg
Work and study is equally important i suggest you put that as priority,btohqsg
It is not a question of priorities. It is a question of purpose,btohqsg
