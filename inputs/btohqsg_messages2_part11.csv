Hihi! Just wondering if owning a resale flat means that we would be given a lower priority (balloting etc) for BTO?My BF and I are first time buyers and are looking to apply for a BTO unit but given the current projected waiting times (5 years!)  we’re wondering if we should get a resale flat while we wait.,btohqsg
you'll be first timer next time upon balloting for BTO  that is if you are not taking the grant upon getting resale,btohqsg
got grant for resale means you're giving up your first timer chance as well  for future BTO,btohqsg
even if you're second timer  there won't be guarantee you get crap ballot number for BTO,btohqsg
ever considered SBF? shorter time frame but it costs more,btohqsg
difference can be up to $30k increase from the pricing upon BTO launch,btohqsg
Why is sbf price hiked up?,btohqsg
maybe due to shorter waiting time?,btohqsg
Hi how long does it takes for the bto to be ready?,btohqsg
currently shld be 5 to 7 yrs,btohqsg
This is for the new launch?,btohqsg
Mine is from the 2018 launch. I heard there will be 9 months delay. Is that true?,btohqsg
So if market dips  sbf price dips?,btohqsg
think cheapest & fastest to get an unit is via Open Booking,btohqsg
We checked! But the units are also quite limited 😅Keeping our fingers crossed for the May launch next year 🤞,btohqsg

Hi all  just joined this group. Does anyone know if I am midway thru my resale MOP  can I apply for BTO?And if so I must apply for those that expected TOP on or after my current MOP right?How much time do I have to sell the current flat after taking BTO keys?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Also  would my situation affect my ballot chances,btohqsg
there were many trying their luck in BTO despite MOP not met,btohqsg
HDB gives you 6 months to dispose your flat after key collection,btohqsg
2nd timer has much lower chance in getting a number,btohqsg
