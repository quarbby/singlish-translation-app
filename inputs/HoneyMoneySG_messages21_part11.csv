Morning all  I'm new to revolut Card. Planning to go holiday in Malaysia soon but don't want to carry cash Ard over there.Can those experienced advice if it be better for me to transfer the money that I were to spend/ pay ie: hotel stay and dining be safe and easy transact if I were to transfer them to revolut Card here before going Malaysia then just pay using the revolut Card rather than cash there?,btohqsg
I received an email/sms saying UOB Absolute AMEX now only has 0.3% cashback for Grab top ups ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Yep  old news and has been discussed extensively for the past few days.,btohqsg
The card itself is 1.6% cash back  similar to other 1.5% ones. Major diff is the Cashback need to be redeemed manually (only via sms) in blocks of 10/20/50 dollars.Most other cards do auto Cashback for any odd amount,btohqsg
Since Grabpay+UOB combi has been nerfed  I am switching my strategy to using Citi Cashback+ with Samsung pay. So that I can earn 1.6% cashback and gain samsung reward pts.,btohqsg
Yea thats what I thought as well. I can't even see when the billing cycle date,btohqsg
I know AMEX TCB 3%promo canâ€™t use for Grab but how about 1.5% normal cashback? Is it still working?,btohqsg
Wah.... I only hold the card for less than 1 year then this happens with grab pay... Not worth it... Need to apply other cards that benefits.,btohqsg
Btw  how many cc can 1 person have max?,btohqsg
Not sure but can be a lot. Guess Chris have more than 10 card.  Just need to apply separately every month.,btohqsg
Maybe can ask Chris to show us his cards collection album.,btohqsg
I'm intending to get 1 card which is good for miles and point. But now sure which card and how to build the point cos I'm new to this miles thingy,btohqsg
Read up & check Chris reviews,btohqsg
Hi  does this method work to pay CC bills.?Use Amex TCB or UOB Absolute top-up Grab.Use Grab to pay CC bills via AXS.Any info?Thank you,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t matter. U can have a lot of card as long as your cbr is healthy,btohqsg
Is a matter of the total unsecured loan that ur entitled to,btohqsg
I did this using absolute. But didn't see the cashback,btohqsg
Even if you top up with grab to get the 1.5/1.7%. THen use Grab to pay CC bills?,btohqsg
Now I'm thinking if I should cancel my absolute card and get another diff card. But not sure if it will hurt my credit score cos absolute card is less than 1 year.,btohqsg
Anyone heard of or involved in preferred financing ? Tks,btohqsg
not possible cashback was not credited since it was grab top ups and its eligible. For UOB Abs  CB is posted in the following month's statements,btohqsg
Recalled some say UOB amex Cash back delayed usually More like 3 mth,btohqsg
Anex issued don't have this issue is issued same months state ment,btohqsg
3 months? Have not experienced that myself as of late. All my CB are posted timely in the following monthâ€™s statements,btohqsg
To clarify 3 months meaning 3rd statement?,btohqsg
Correct me if im wrong   but from what I understand  it's never possible to earn cashback through paying off credit card bills..,btohqsg
Yep  but if its possible to do it via grab  you can earn cashback  as the cashback is from topping up,btohqsg
Morning guys  just wanna to check if anyone have purchased ziptracks from Legate  which MCC code would it under(trying to see if I can use my OCBC titanium card to earn 4 mpd here),btohqsg
I just tested.. not possible to use grab card for credit card payment it seems..,btohqsg
By right bank worn allow u to use another method to pay your cc card BillOnly banks transfer to pay cc bill woek,btohqsg
Hi  I'm going on a trip to HK soon  just wondering which is the best credit card to use there,btohqsg
Would recommend instarem amaze paired with citi rewards,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend a good savings account just for savings without much requirement like salary credit.. spend etc?,btohqsg
Are you able to make at least 3 GIRO debit transactions a month?,btohqsg
Thanks everyone who updated about ipaymy already nerfed with Uob one!  Meant that as a question instead of a statement.,btohqsg
Yes  to earn EIR 3% interest per month,btohqsg
That one I'm not sure  have to check with UOB,btohqsg
If you're willing to do money transfers every month  you can watch this video for some recommendationshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETTE16S8VLw,btohqsg
if not  some accounts I can recommend are SIF GoSavers  SC Jumpstart  Trust Bank and Singlife,btohqsg
Hi. Can check is the Maybank f&f card 8% rebate eligible with the amaze card?,btohqsg
Only on the eligible MCCs. Merchant-specific 8% rate not eligible,btohqsg
Oic. Hard to know the MCCs... What abt the Citi cash back?  Same?,btohqsg
Same but Citi Cash Back only has MCC bonuses. No merchant-specific bonuses,btohqsg
Yes it's hard to know the exact MCCs but you can agak agak. Example: NTUC will always be supermarket,btohqsg
I use the f&f for dining. I check the transaction on valid for the 8%,btohqsg
Maybe it's classified fast food which is ineligible for 8%. These things happen.,btohqsg
