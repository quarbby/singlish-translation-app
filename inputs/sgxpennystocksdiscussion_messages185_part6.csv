Oceanus so weird..been holding well the whole day at 26/27...and almost 4mil was throw out after 5pm. Can anyone enlighten me on this ?,btohqsg
@StockchamI follow you and buy oceanus before closing...cos selling at T+4 well absorbed and look good on chart,btohqsg
Contra T+4 due today and force selling.,btohqsg
I see...I think same for HS and clearbridge,btohqsg
Gender specific - yes...a bro üòÖ,btohqsg
TA no comments  as the sp will still hold for a while longer due to the status as micro pennies leader. FA wise  overvalued taken into account the shares outstanding. But short term  TA sometimes overshadowed FA.,btohqsg
Welcome...for oceanus  you can work backwards T+4 ... which would have been the previous high in this case...so today  all the contra players will have to sell off if they dont pick up....so most will wait last minute for buyers  if not  have to sell off which leads to sell-down at closing.,btohqsg
