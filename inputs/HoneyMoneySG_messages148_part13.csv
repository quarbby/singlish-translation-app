If I recall correctly in the IVR  it already states that ‚Äòthe agents will not be able to assist you‚Äô for fee waivers. They expect customer to use the SC mobile app or online banking for such request.,btohqsg
Yes. It stated.But unable to proceed further after step 2.,btohqsg
I was just at SCB saw 2 customers asking for waiver at the branch.,btohqsg
You did not manage to input your card number?,btohqsg
So they expect us to terminate the card via phone or app too?,btohqsg
No idea. Can‚Äôt speak for them.But the industry is going towards accepting waiver request via automated channels of IVR/chat bot/mobile app/ online banking.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the direction for a lot of things in our live now  ain‚Äôt it?The bot is taking over,btohqsg
