I was in your situation a few days ago...selected a flat even though i was waiting for Aug results.,btohqsg
Lol hopefully result out tmr then,btohqsg
An option is to push your appt date back  but im not sure about the process for that (eg when your next appt date would be). Plus in the meantime  more flats would be selected by queue numbers after you,btohqsg
If you do this  you risk not getting a flat (of my choice) for May 2022 by delaying the selection appt  as its not even certain that you could get a queue number  let alone a good queue number. And you will also get non-selection count of 1.But this is up to your risk tolerance (are you willing to wait for another launch if you dont get aug?); how much you want a flat for this 28 Sep appt's project vs Aug project; how will the non-selection count affect you etc. Some things to consider that i thought of when i was in that situation,btohqsg
Thank you everyone for the input!,btohqsg
I will convey all these input to my parents‚Äô,btohqsg
Hopefully the Aug BTO results will come out tmr too,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to check. I applied for a sbf flat but am considering to withdraw due to the upcoming kallang bto.  Will I be considered as a first timer or 2nd?,btohqsg
Withdraw as in you got a queue number but not yet selected a flat?If its your first time doing so you'll still be considered a 1st timer for kallang nov bto  as you only have a non-selection count of 1. If this is your 2nd time then for kallang you'll be considered 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Gotten my letter today and my queue for the sbf. Appt for selection is next month. Is my first attempt in applying for a flat as a first timer? Apologies for the broken English.,btohqsg
Also  say I've selected a flat and it's completed? Whats the duration between the signing and move in? Cos don't want to rush myself and hoping to get at least a gap of at least 6 months before moving in to new flat.,btohqsg
No dont worry  i understood you well! Since youve never rejected hdb before  if you reject this sbf selection  no penalty ie youre still considered 1st timer.Feel free to pm to clarify if i didnt explain well üòÖ,btohqsg
Anybody knows link to tampines greencourt telegram?,btohqsg
Hi curious to know if anyone knows if there are consequences of people ghosting during the appointment yo book flat ? Will you lose your first timer chance?,btohqsg
If you accumulate up to 2 times of non selection  you will be placed under second timer for 1 yr,btohqsg

Pros of Sale of Balance Flats (SBF):2 New flats with fresh lease: As with new BTO flats  HDB SBF flats come with a fresh 99-year lease. Since it‚Äôs new  you don‚Äôt have to worry about any damage done by the previous owner.,btohqsg
May I know the meaning of this? Does that mean if I buy from SBF a unit that‚Äôs not 99 years remaining e.g. 65 years when I buy it the lease will be renewed?,btohqsg
I saw this on propertyguru page,btohqsg
Some of SBF is brand new which nobody stay before. As for the 99 yr lease  not sure how it was computed. Is it start based on 1st occupier of the flat or?,btohqsg
SBF is a mix of unsold BTOs and repurchased HDB flats (inherited but ineligible etc)You can check the lease remaining on the SBF listing,btohqsg
If SBF flat happens to be BTO in progress  yes 99 year lease.,btohqsg
But the line HDB flats with a fresh lease?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to worry about the damage done by previous owner tho,btohqsg
Whole block same lease  hdb won't extend lease for single flat,btohqsg
Unless when the time comes they find a way to suspend your flat midair and demolish the others ü§≠,btohqsg
Can i check.. if Lets say my grandparent old place was enbloc-ed. then moved to a new BTO (Currently living in the BTO). during the MOP period  grandparent passes away... can the children sell the BTO in the open market?,btohqsg
Definitely can. If HDB say cannot  someone should go there and slap them üòÇ,btohqsg
So that means the line from propertyguru was incorrect?,btohqsg

The thing is  the children definitely have their own house. At the same time  they cannot have two HDB at the same time. So HDB will definitely force you to sell,btohqsg
yup understand. so can sell into open market right? not sell back to HDB,btohqsg
Though unsure if you need to surrender back to HDB and get the remaining lease money from HDB  or can sell in open market,btohqsg
Doubt so  do check with hdb,btohqsg
Sorry  selective reading  I just saw the ‚Äúopen market‚Äù,btohqsg
Lease commencement date can't change bro,btohqsg
"SBF is like buying a ""Resale"" from HDB.",btohqsg
Lease of the block will not change...,btohqsg
if left 50years.. your lease is 50 years,btohqsg
I understand that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm puzzled why fresh lease was written? Because it‚Äôs a mix of BTO   SERS and flats repurchased by HDB. Not just from previous BTO exercises units,btohqsg
Either out of context or inaccurate lor. If not from HDB  take with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Anyone have progress of BTO on Bukit Batok west hill   many thanks üôè,btohqsg
