The workshop they frequent also end up a few FC RX7 maintain there one. Cos their people in their clique owns the RX7,btohqsg
I hanged out with them once. HAHAHAHA behsai. All too rich alr,btohqsg
they are a group of young guys who love old cars haha,btohqsg
i can appreciate but totally wont own one again,btohqsg
6mth of eg6 ownership enough liao.,btohqsg
old man also like young car leh..,btohqsg
That's why i didn't wanna go so old.,btohqsg
i think 2000s still relatively ok,btohqsg
90s and 80s too old alr,btohqsg
even getting a zc31 after the eg6 felt so much better overall,btohqsg
but 90s is golden era for JDM.. many classic good car in this era,btohqsg
swift is a good next gen replacement for EGs,btohqsg
it was golden when it was golden.,btohqsg
actually ah. I think if you really think carefully,btohqsg
Supra  GTR34  Evo9 all these in 2000s one lehh,btohqsg
toyota leading in the new era now. supra  86  corolla  yaris,btohqsg
I wish i can afford one,btohqsg
Actually all these cars are overrated,btohqsg
Only the supra is something to love but that’s thanks to b58,btohqsg
I think they are popular for a reason one ba. Hahaha,btohqsg
But i kinda want a GR Copen more,btohqsg
The GR copen situation in singapore pissed me off,btohqsg
And I'm so happy Elementz motor stuck with so many unsold unit,btohqsg
i think the GR yaris was overhyped. and sold at a ridiculous price locally,btohqsg
i'd pick the gr corolla over it.,btohqsg
all cars are price ridiculously here,btohqsg
a couple on sgcarmart within a month or 2,btohqsg
People who buy gr yaris mostly have super cars lol,btohqsg
And they know they can profit off COE as it climbs,btohqsg
car prices abit crazy within this 2 years,btohqsg
It’s meant to be an affordable mass market car that’s fun,btohqsg
And gives you a rally like handling,btohqsg
Toyota only made it in limited quantities,btohqsg
So they had to cover back their R&D prices with just a few thousands unit sold,btohqsg
and if you think about performance vs price.,btohqsg
FK8R and STI are at the same prices as the Yaris,btohqsg
So i dont think it's overpriced,btohqsg
I think it's fair  but yeah I can't afford it  so I'm not hating it,btohqsg
in terms of price  for sure could be expensive. but i believe the gr cars that came out are all very capable cars,btohqsg
Now what i believe the corolla will be cheaper than a yaris  because it's a mass produced unit,btohqsg
I just think it doesn’t justify the price tag   (although I can afford it),btohqsg
i see it as like the normal civic and the civic typer,btohqsg
or the lancer and the evo,btohqsg
yaris will be overshadowed by corolla. for sure,btohqsg
now gr yaris also like forgotten already,btohqsg
the corolla is a nice looking car,btohqsg
Do you see anyone talking about it,btohqsg
Even the owners who own it,btohqsg
cheap japanese performance cars is no longer a thing anymore,btohqsg
They won’t hate on it because they paid for it  but they won’t tell you it’s worth every $ paid,btohqsg
