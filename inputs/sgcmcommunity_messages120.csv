I think ppl see us buy attrage at 100k they laughing at us alr,btohqsg
Those who diy ; do u coat 9H first then wax ?,btohqsg
Sgcarmart warranty only last 6 months after purchase?,btohqsg
If we look at it  honestly  none of us owns a car🤣everyone is just long term leasing,btohqsg
Yes Tks bought the polisher   9H   wax   claybar  iron remover try to diy,btohqsg
Take your time! Better to be slow and thorough than rush and botch it,btohqsg
Question: if you had the option to buy a COE that’s transferrable to ANY car and would have no expiration to it  but would cost you a kidney  liver  half a lung  and your partner’s half a pancreas  would you?,btohqsg
Normally after polish and wax ist let it cure for 24 hrs then Coat 9H ?,btohqsg
I’ve never cured between a wax and a coat  but I cure between coating  but not 24 hours,btohqsg
Coating just takes a long time generally. Then again  I’m OCD.,btohqsg
Oh pls do it slow. Coating cannot rush,btohqsg
Nope. Now the new cars be like :o,btohqsg
But then you only pay ARF and OMV etc.,btohqsg
Actually we are the only country with ARF and OMV no?,btohqsg
Our cars here are taxed like 3 4 times more,btohqsg
Eg gst applied aft arf and omv,btohqsg
Coe is a luxury tax on a majority non-luxury good. But in the flip side our income tax is low for a developed country  while our public services are among the best world wide,btohqsg
Yes direct taxes we are considered very very low. Pls consider indirect taxes too,btohqsg
Yeah that's fair. Like our cpf,btohqsg
So if CPF Gets deducted  but we are still taxed on our gross not nett income. Essentially  lesser amount of cash ON Hand,btohqsg
Indo has 200-400% on luxury cars,btohqsg
Bro u alr said luxury cars,btohqsg
Isn't cpf tax deductible? At least that's what I see in my iras statement. I think not full relief though,btohqsg
Yes tax deductible for Compulsory contributions,btohqsg
Ours no matter what still whack. Altho our ARF is staggered so luxury cars get taxed more. Similar to indonesia ah based on what u say,btohqsg
I mean Indo tax still cheap,btohqsg
There's an 80k relief cap on personal income. So no more than 80k cpf eligible for relief which I think 99% should qualify for!,btohqsg
It’s relief on contribution right? So income tax only on your take home,btohqsg
Yes my bad. I forgot abt that relief,btohqsg
So compulsory contributions are not taxable,btohqsg
But we pay tax everyday   where got low ?,btohqsg
The accumulation of tax you pay all add up is consider massive amount,btohqsg
Add up is what u said,btohqsg
5 room resales HDB want to sell 1.5m   omg,btohqsg
Every thing in sg all expensive,btohqsg
When grants increment went the opposite way of what you intended,btohqsg
I tot xin is a female,btohqsg
Our hDB is similar to car,btohqsg
Public buses and Taxis also pay PQP?,btohqsg
or xin is just pete trying to parody xun,btohqsg
No because they actually make sense,btohqsg
That's why I go with they,btohqsg
They're not luxury goods  the government doesn't classify vehicles as luxury. It's more of a non necessity I suppose,btohqsg
Also if taxis and buses didn't pay pqp,btohqsg
Wah your gahmen supported company no need pay tax one,btohqsg
Like everyone yell about COE right now,btohqsg
who knows he learnt after getting banned 4 times,btohqsg
And yell about people being able to buy multiple cars,btohqsg
He came back as S and didn't,btohqsg
S got banned already ah ahahaha,btohqsg
Also Sir/Ma'am Xin has multiple profile pictures,btohqsg
Because these non thinkers dont understand the term PUBLIC TRANSPORT,btohqsg
If PQP wasnt required for them  our public tpt wud actually be cheaper.,btohqsg
if pqp wasn't required for them everybody and their grandmother will become grab drivers,btohqsg
I think taxi and phv difference quite clear,btohqsg
I believe Mr History was talking about the SH plates,btohqsg
Oh yes I only referring to SH,btohqsg
Taxi and PHV are quite different,btohqsg
If mrt got pqp riot alr sial,btohqsg
I think the pricing not bad,btohqsg
Just need to find concession card that suits you,btohqsg
For the type of transport we get,btohqsg
All stations got big fan or aircon,btohqsg
Trains and buses clean on the inside,btohqsg
Shelters around mrts to nearby buildings,btohqsg
You go outside see the prices for public transport and the quality,btohqsg
Tax payers pay for all these,btohqsg
U need compare first world countries ah,btohqsg
Bro isnt this like the bare minimum,btohqsg
Go outside of Singapore and see,btohqsg
Yeap japan and s.korea also similar to ours,btohqsg
US train you need biohazard wash after going in compared to SG,btohqsg
Australia the public transport like 2x-3x more ex than SG,btohqsg
And the connectivity isn't the best,btohqsg
You go UK tube during peak times,btohqsg
No aircon one and more packed than ewl during peak hours,btohqsg
Their healthcare payment is way lesser than ours shud they fall sick,btohqsg
They pay a 2% levy for that on their income as Medicare levy,btohqsg
Whereas in SG if you're pr/citizen you got subsides already if you go public hospital or polyclinic,btohqsg
You see right  if one looks,btohqsg
Can find things to complain about,btohqsg
Can find things to appreciate also,btohqsg
U dun see me complaining our security here 🙈,btohqsg
45% for top end. Realistically about 24-27%. 30% for the average person usually,btohqsg
I just realised that aaron michael and arnav guliani r 2 diff persons. 😱😱😱,btohqsg
But you get the point  also put in upto for that reason,btohqsg
It's been over 3 months already,btohqsg
And you never notice we different,btohqsg
Need spend lesser time on telegram,btohqsg
We alternate months win pls thanks,btohqsg
I win once I okay liao,btohqsg
You win how many times already?,btohqsg
So I don’t have to top up my cashcard,btohqsg
You got your pokemon card folder full already?,btohqsg

I also new in this group,btohqsg
He new member each time he changed car,btohqsg
U might be winnin dis month,btohqsg
I working at office these few weeks,btohqsg
Then you really need sgcm detox,btohqsg
I call cars luxury because we pay duties like they're optional goods  when in reality there's a sizeable population who need cars. For eg I've 2 kids to ferry  who is the govt to tell me public transport is good enough?,btohqsg
No leh I didn't I was asking,btohqsg
Because not everyone just wants to be living bread and butter,btohqsg
Who doesn’t want a better quality of life,btohqsg
I think our govt policy is so focused on bread and butter such that they forgot that the citizens too have a life outside of work,btohqsg
1 million resale. 700 800k BTO,btohqsg
I considering there alr and its not cheap alr,btohqsg
My sister got hers for 290k at yishun,btohqsg
I got mine for 360k @ Tengah,btohqsg
My friend got his 5rm 500k,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion but 5rm bto is a scam,btohqsg
You don’t even get an extra room,btohqsg
But he was telling me abt it,btohqsg
500k is cheap for 5 rm,btohqsg
It’s going around for that price,btohqsg
And now gahmen give more grant also,btohqsg
You want be picky  don’t complain. You wanna complain  don’t be picky.,btohqsg
Oh so it's gonna be 520k now,btohqsg
I tried one time and i didnt even get a queue number,btohqsg
Because people get extra 30k grant,btohqsg
My friend tried 11 times and failed,btohqsg
Isn't that what they're supposed to be focused on?,btohqsg
This is turning into a propertyguru community,btohqsg
Then people work on obtaining the rest of the things by working harder,btohqsg
But a van and live in it,btohqsg
Its not feasible in SG leh,btohqsg
Wa BRO U DONT COME ASK ME FOR DK WHAT CAR U WANT WHEN I STRIKE TOTO ALR,btohqsg
U ALR USED UP UR LUCK IN FIRST TIME BTO ALR,btohqsg
Got different generations coming into the workforce?,btohqsg
Wa this no job i damn triggered. There is always jobs available,btohqsg
Been there done that. Sometimes just need to work extra harder,btohqsg
You will always be able to find a job,btohqsg
Even if you no money and no education,btohqsg
As long as you're from here,btohqsg
That’s why when I hear YOUNG singaporeans complain about not having a job,btohqsg
Ask them wash dishes they don’t want,btohqsg
Govt. give out jobs like pamphlet,btohqsg
Wa bro when I say Job ah  i dunmean UNDEREMPLOYMENT LEH,btohqsg
See SIA people work as the red shirt people,btohqsg
Bro not all courses worth that much,btohqsg
Problem with most people is that they want money but they don’t wanna work for it,btohqsg
Good convo but let me uturn to cars. Anyone bought 2nd hand from wearnes? Ok or better off buying new,btohqsg
How early u need wake up sia,btohqsg
You study so hard but end up working outside of what you studied,btohqsg
AD selling traded in cars is same as any other dealership. They probably check thoroughly to ensure the car is good condition tho,btohqsg
Is how many hrs sleep he getting sia,btohqsg
Except if the car is from their own brand,btohqsg
And I nap in the afternoon,btohqsg
After work I can catch up on my sleep,btohqsg
Cheap leh   I got mine resale for 500 plus k for 4 rm,btohqsg
Peace of mind for when you buy  then can choose to go to independents for maintenance yourself,btohqsg
I tot Xin just bought a car,btohqsg
Or did I remember wrong X,btohqsg
Volvo xc40 or similar conti. Thinking with 1st year depre  more worth it to buy 2nd hand new-ish car,btohqsg
Oh right someone told u get tesla right,btohqsg

Dont let the depre kill u,btohqsg
Resale value will be insane after MOP,btohqsg

What did u guys call bmw mercs and ahdi again?,btohqsg
Just that luxury cars get the brunt of it,btohqsg
Coz they think they own the road,btohqsg
Ask sgcarvigilant do up a stats,btohqsg

I saw one car they making abt 15k profit,btohqsg
Consign is a banned word ah,btohqsg
As long as you're not in a rush to sell  no point selling to dealers,btohqsg
actually idk how consignment process works,btohqsg
so i need to pay off loan prior to selling?,btohqsg
The shop will settle for you,btohqsg
Have you ever seen sgrv use captions like HONDA DRIVER DO THIS,btohqsg
They do it purely out of the want for clicks and views as they are a monetized platform,btohqsg
And portraying cars most aspire to have as bad or stupid is an easy way to get hits,btohqsg
Posting stupid videos that make no sense also gets hits,btohqsg
But can get better selling price if the loan settle by yourself than the shop right .,btohqsg
No la settle loan is just take what you get for your car and pay off your outstanding,btohqsg
You can do it yourself also but consignment makes it easier,btohqsg

Guys  I got a dilemma in choosing between mazda 3 hb vs octavia 1.5. Both current gen,btohqsg
But personally I would buy the mazda 3,btohqsg
better interior according to me and the hatchback just looks stunning,btohqsg
performance then need to go 2.0,btohqsg
stock car won't be an issue sir,btohqsg
Stock car will have problems too sir,btohqsg
it's the golfs and octavias that are modded and go through multiple owners who don't do repairs,btohqsg
if you decide to not maintain it ever,btohqsg
Turbocharged Vs NA quite obvious which one will be less reliable also,btohqsg
but warranty only 3 to 5 years anyway,btohqsg
after that need to see yourself,btohqsg
so I don't see how the warranty will help,btohqsg
Anyway I got friend who has the 2.0 Octavia the plastic bits in the cabin feel super cheap,btohqsg
In comparison Mazda interior feels more solid,btohqsg
Agree  the mazda interior to me is better,btohqsg
they haven't updated the rest for some reason,btohqsg
by the cx-30 and the 3 is very nice,btohqsg
turbo is the best for the first 5 years😛,btohqsg
that's y u see the old BMW n Benz can last very long,btohqsg
all about how you maintain as well,btohqsg
but yes N.A. relatively longer lasting if maintained properly,btohqsg
of course both sides have their bad apples with unreliable engines,btohqsg
Both are 2021 car. I am surprised octavia ride is not as comfortable as what people praised online,btohqsg
My mind is thinking of the octavia in terms of money sense because similar depre but cat b coe with more power,btohqsg
But my heart is with m3. So sexy and pretty interior,btohqsg
is the suspension in good shape?,btohqsg
what are your priorities? a nice place to be in or a slightly more powerful engine?,btohqsg
Havent. I thought they are just 1 year plus with less than 20k km  should be safe?,btohqsg
Buy with your ❤️... Mantra by alfisti,btohqsg
can is can but better do basic inspection anyway,btohqsg
in case any wear and tear to be done up  can negotiate based on that,btohqsg
120% full loan with ❤️ also,btohqsg
Haha hb with red interior damn nice but too bad exterior is machine grey and not soul red,btohqsg
20k km driven by a F1 wanabee will be worse condition than a 200k car driven by a slow retiree.😂,btohqsg
Eye opener...I'll consider mazda if I change car lol,btohqsg
The retiree cannot feel the spongy brakes  dying absorbers and spoilt aircon,btohqsg
as long as the retiree's workshop or AD good,btohqsg
and he just pays the bill,btohqsg
these are small prob compared to engine n gearbox😛,btohqsg
As long as retiree doesn't skip alll the repairs,btohqsg
Brake failure when coming down from genting,btohqsg

How does mild hybrid compare against honda's hybrid? Or they are similar?,btohqsg
Wah I see the fc between the 2  cannot compare,btohqsg
hearsay Prius is the best if FC is your thang,btohqsg
prius full tank 1000km  only if ur battery health good leh,btohqsg
the battery health will degrade over time,btohqsg
My current D2D ride is around 900km per tank,btohqsg
Drive to Malaysia I can get 550km 😂,btohqsg
In Singapore can get 450 I very happy,btohqsg
drove the cupra formentor  nice ride and handling. 190hp but feels higher. Anyone else tried it and considered it?,btohqsg
Yes buy m3. It’s a very good car.,btohqsg
M3.....mazda 3? Or bmw m3? 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
"Don't get turbo cars  that 1 Sec when you floor and it ""doesnt"" move is scary 😐",btohqsg
hi all  any one saw this on SGCM Website before?can share your thoughts with me on this? 😅,btohqsg
Oh. No m3 that Deutsche legend muscle car ah,btohqsg
Where is the brake kit? Photo only got rotors and pads,btohqsg
The actual calipers impossible to be that cheap,btohqsg
Don’t floor. Just gentle poke. Like treat your gf or bf lidat,btohqsg
Then the ad is misleading lo,btohqsg
Brake kit is the whole shebang,btohqsg
Rotor and pad just say rotor and pad,btohqsg
elantra can get 500 - 600km full tank,btohqsg
is turbo really that unreliable? never own one before,btohqsg
the octavia suspension doesnt seems to be able to soaked up those humps and etc as well as I imagined. Didnt get to try mazda 3 on bumpy roads or those speed humps,btohqsg
It's just in comparison a few more parts so your maintenance regime slightly different,btohqsg
Then just buy another set of pads,btohqsg
Got one ws owner say turbo if not familiar driver can get into trouble cos will miss the rush  end up timing haywire and crash,btohqsg
If you can crash because of turbo lag on a day to 2 day turbo,btohqsg
I think you need to give up your license,btohqsg
It’s not about turbo or not,btohqsg
It’s about how you take care of it,btohqsg
Maybe the bumps then not the cars,btohqsg
Try taking the Mazda over carpark humps in the building,btohqsg
Turbo lag ain't great... You step accelerator now tomorrow then feel the boost,btohqsg
Then the same with the octavia,btohqsg
That’s why NA is the best,btohqsg
Mazda 3.Comfort 👍Gearbox change smooth👍Go and test drive 👍👍,btohqsg
Sports suspension mah! For more sporty ride one needs to feel the road 🥰,btohqsg
NA any sh|7 is best to me,btohqsg
Main issue for Mazda is mainly just the motor for folding side mirrors and capacitor that has issues. Other than that no major faults or complaints. Not sure if the '21 model has improvements on those parts but I know they upgraded their air intake flow for the new models so that's nice,btohqsg
What is life without taking a little a risk?,btohqsg
The design interior and exterior is amazing,btohqsg
The window motors also sometimes kaput,btohqsg
Any window motor will with time lah,btohqsg
If folding side mirror is the only major issue with the car  where do I sign up?,btohqsg
yeah... i just realised the Brake kit isnt included...,btohqsg
Im sure there are other faults  it cant be bulletproof but that's one of the common issues most Mazda cars face,btohqsg
wonder will have any issue if use back old one,btohqsg
Forget to unfold pax side before driving off how?,btohqsg
On hazard light  exit and close,btohqsg
I've heard some had to change the motors for the mirrors every year  some every few years,btohqsg

Oh didnt know they improved the air intake for the ‘21. The SE said only the rearlight. Maybe thats where the additional 2bhp came from,btohqsg
Previously listed as 118bhp. Newest spec list listed as 120bhp,btohqsg
If u got auto start stop  just code off permanently. Bad for SG road,btohqsg

that's just an excuse... to suck more money. I understand Coe part to make cars exp. but why 10 years? to keep the money rolling in baby😛😛😂😂,btohqsg
They need to let the dealer make profit too,btohqsg
