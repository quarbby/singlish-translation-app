Think we everyday share how much we do here,btohqsg
I create one spreadsheet to calculate,btohqsg
Do 1 trip 12km is 1litres. So must minus $1.99 liao,btohqsg
But nvr incli maintenance all those,btohqsg
I think it unnecessary. Because it's based on many factors and we don't only do llm. So it's not a fair comparison,btohqsg
Worked about 6 hrs a day,btohqsg
No bro just wanted to see if rly earn ah,btohqsg
About $10/hr i also est ard there,btohqsg
But I share only llm trips here. It makes sense that way lor,btohqsg

These marinated thawed chicken is a risk as some may lick and your car will stink for the next few days,btohqsg
Please spread the message around. Some customer just think we drive big car.. lucky mine is shuttle  easy to slide in and out. Imagine those Mazda 2 or Suzuki swift.. need to reach into the rear of boot to put it into the boot,btohqsg

Your account has been suspended for 2 days for accumulating 5 penalty notices. Despite reminders  you were still late for pick-up and for several orders  you clicked on Picked Up and Completed at the end of the order. Your account will be reactivated fully on 4 June 2020.In the meantime  you may still proceed for your ongoing orders that you have accepted in advance.Please take this time to review the Lalamove training materials on the proper order taking process -bit.ly/lalamoveedumeNeed Advise from the ol bird here.. wat the hell is phone coaching..,btohqsg
If got car order prepare for van size üòÇ,btohqsg
Seriously like only once the rest like bikes?? ü§£,btohqsg
I think they will call u and advice u?,btohqsg
No idea how to use it though,btohqsg
Because customers smart Liao  they know we will LL move so all select bike rate lor,btohqsg
Unless is oddle they got some algorithm,btohqsg
Yah this is what i think so too. But really too much i felt. I met one guy today and we spoke awhile. I got 2 items (2 location) for driving and he got 3 items (3location) for riding. The rider kp until his box cannot fit. I say u should just feed back rather then u smash inside. But some how he manage to keep all those stuff inside lol,btohqsg
This is crazy lorry will pick aeroplane cargo üòÇ,btohqsg
Feedback no use one lah... once order completed   good luck. U see yesterday discussion some oldbirds got share how to claim,btohqsg
Yeah i read up. Is kind of like the whole thing is in a mass but nobody can do anything about it since is for a living,btohqsg
Got 12k drivers bro. Maybe if 12 rider they will bother lah.,btohqsg
Haha correct  now everyone is just doing for a living only. The rest not so much,btohqsg
Bring a measuring tape and a luggage weighing scale,btohqsg
If item oversized or overweight  tell customer have to upgrade to car or else they will be billed 50 percent of the delivery fee as cancellation fee,btohqsg
For me  I bring along a sling bag which carry the following1) notes2) coins3) 5m measuring tape4) luggage weighing scale,btohqsg
Coins and notes i do. Tape and scale i will do it too. Thanks for advice,btohqsg
I got once took a order for raw satay delivery. 13 pkt of 50 satays. Total about 11kg. customer smoke me less than 8kg.. said other rider got do his job before.  I took Liao  take measuring scale. Took photo and tell him change to car  he agreeFor cash order  do a check in lalamove customer app to see the difference  ask customer top up the difference directly to you in cash then call or email lalamove CS to amend order. Customer can;1) choose to pay you bike fare first  once CS confirm on the price difference  customer have to paynow you back. DO NOT OFFER THE OPTION TO GO BACK COLLECT2)customer can directly top up the difference in cash first then call CS or email them with screenshot to tell them change to carFor credit order  check price difference and inform customer then call or email lalamove CS,btohqsg
For wrong address  either postal code  blk no  unit no  please SMS customer to confirm even after calling him/her. Use your conversation and email to lalamove to claim multinoted surcharge. $3 for bike and $5 for car,btohqsg
Guys  please don't be stupid. A lot of customer and business owner is trying their luck. They know item is oversized or overweight but they just want to offer lowball,btohqsg
üëç thanks for nice advice üòÅ,btohqsg
While I sympathize business owner or customer dealing with thinning margin  I'm concerned my take home money too. So don't be stupid,btohqsg
For late orders  take car park receipt to justifyIf it's HDB and you park along road side  take photo evidence,btohqsg
Lalamove price already like shit especially multiple stops,btohqsg
Even order completed  CS can amend order too. Ask customer to paynow youGive a reasonable time to transfer you. If customer failed to paynow you  lodge a police report then email to lalamove. Lalamove will compensate you,btohqsg
If there is car order  and item require trolley but failed to include in remarks  we driver reserve the rights to cancel,btohqsg
If bike order put trolley required  just go customer place. Take photo evidence on oversized item and ask for cancellations fees,btohqsg
But if lala don't compensate  what can we do...,btohqsg
Most customer will. I met a case where customer Don't want to pay the difference. I lodge a police report as per lalamove CS. They then compensate me. The investigation took a while though,btohqsg
Hopefully that customer account got banned,btohqsg
The lalamove CS nowadays don't even advise. They just say we will call u,btohqsg
Calling them is useless. Some can even argue with you. Fucking no manners,btohqsg
Chase. Just type  hi lalamove team  any updates?,btohqsg
I sometime don‚Äôt even understand what they talking lol than give up calling liao anymore unless really bo bian,btohqsg
You Heng u tio local agent  still ok. You tio tagalore CS  you can jump down,btohqsg
I will cup the phone lol,btohqsg
Bottom line.. be polite to customer even when it's oversized  overweight  late pick up for food. Just smile and go,btohqsg
Always ask if receipent on the other end will be expecting the delivery now.Ever tio surprised delivery from customer to receipent and receipent not home.,btohqsg
If customer act blur or genuinely don't know about lalamove policy on overweight  bring up the consumer lalamove app and show them,btohqsg
Hello everyone. I am a new Lalamove driver. Any advices would be greatly appreciated :),btohqsg
Read all the  message from this group chat,btohqsg

Yeah i was reading some of the chats. About auto click for jobs etc plus recent ones,btohqsg
yeah. lucky me. i saw some good tips lol. i need to buy a luggage weighing scale :S,btohqsg
Don't bother.. lalamove is sweeping users using autoclick,btohqsg
You want short gain while risking a criminal record  you can go ahead,btohqsg
Isnt auto click bad? I mean  can auto click differentiate the type of orders for vans and trucks?,btohqsg
I car driver.. no privilege to preview van orders,btohqsg
Oh. so there is no way for a car diver to see van orders? which is good lol. no mistakes can be done. only need to see the colour code for the type of orders :S,btohqsg
Use screen split instead... U minimise your window size so your finger movement will be shorter,btohqsg
oh okay. hmm.. usually the job ping will be sent to all drivers in the area and its first come first serve rite?,btohqsg
Priority given to favourites drivers and lalamove stickers for car or lalabag for bike,btohqsg

Actually just start to be curious  mostly biker here or driver here,btohqsg
About to ask the same Q,btohqsg
I'm a driver. 98% of my orders are bike orders.,btohqsg
Actually to me doesn't matter much bro.. all of us is on the same ship..,btohqsg
All of us here are making a living,btohqsg
No hate between drivers and riders here. üëç,btohqsg
Driver bro  yeah just try to get a living out of it only. Hahaha.,btohqsg
And I can relate when riders feedback that order sizing is too big for bikes. Some of them are ridiculous. One particular restaurant at Cathay yestetday had hot tray of pasta and 2 full bags of food.,btohqsg
Nah no hater bro  just that sometime driver abit mad because no car order. Which make us lugi more on petrol.,btohqsg
Actually gojek also same la. Drive around here and there just to get ping. Lol,btohqsg
What to do. Now everything also very bad. Llm cs also one kind only. Side thier customer and we all suffer one,btohqsg
Customer are the one bring in their dough,btohqsg
Yes not wrong  but bring down the market to everyone. Llm currently is the biggest. So if they show this way the rest will follow the same way too. Not as easy to earn a living too üòÇ,btohqsg
For bike llm rates r better?,btohqsg

Hi new rider here need some help how to activate account ? Appreciate if someone can help.,btohqsg
Have u done the quizzes and paid the $75 deposit?,btohqsg
I have make a schedule that day  but unable to attend course,btohqsg
Actually the course can be done online,btohqsg
The quiz can be done online too. so you can do them at home,btohqsg
I dont think any of us has the link here,btohqsg
Cos the quiz will be given after the online training. Its like a zoom training,btohqsg
If you missed the session  you can call to rebook.,btohqsg
And if i remembered correctly  the booking of the session was done during the registration. Not sure if you can access it to change the date,btohqsg
They'll send u invite mail and join meeting?,btohqsg
So I have to call centre and reschedule,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already done the quiz but still not verified yet   may I know why?,btohqsg
That one  you need to chase them. So of the members here had to wait awhile. I think due to covid  it takes longer for your acc to be activated. Some waited for a week. So best is to chase them and enquire bout the progress,btohqsg
Bro thanks   but I already wait 2week ago still no answer try to call also no answer,btohqsg
Bro did u Kenna? Today same thing happen to me üòî,btohqsg
Anyone able to assist one booking @ 1230 pm from Yishun to  Serangoon Garden?,btohqsg
After deposit  i waited 2 weeks and that 2 weeks i kept on chasing them thru CS hotline and live chat daily. Only then they gv me a call back saying to come down and paste sticker  on the spot while pasting sticker the CS who pasted the sticker  told me i can try to on and see the orders coming in and its activated.,btohqsg
Good luck bro. I throw my keys for lalamove,btohqsg
