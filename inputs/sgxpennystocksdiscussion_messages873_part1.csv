The Maui fires destroyed many homes and businesses . Oprah Winfrey who owns 1000 acres of land there and is worth Billions later launched a recovery fund together with the Rock (born in Hawaii  has property there and worth estimated $800mil) asked people to donate. They each donated like 5mil then launched appeals for ppl to donate to their fund help save Maui. Lots of people got really pissed with them with inflation so bad and many just trying to survive and the 2 stars can do more themselves since their own properties were not affected by fire. There's still a lot of conspiracy theories around the cause of the fires even today and residents have been waiting very long for aid from the government.,btohqsg
Btw  there one thing he's scared of,btohqsg

I read and listen to the survivors report too. Too many suspicious point to nitpick that it’s not a natural fire cause incident. Anyway Dwayne Johnson apologize for trying to raise money for the victim with Oprah because of public backlash against two super rich individuals raising money from public instead of them donating to the victims. US govt compensate each fire victims family US$750 for the incident.,btohqsg
The rock's image is also very carefully curated. His movie contracts specify he cannot lose fights and limits the extent he can get injured in fight scenes. While this is completely his right to do so  it shows you how much of a front he has to keep up. Makes you wonder about other parts of his persona.,btohqsg
“They” are preparing and making a path for him to join into politics once he retire from acting at Hollywood.,btohqsg
I read that rumor yes. 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
My general consensus from the X platform is that US is moving into a very turbulent and violent period whether Biden or Trump win the next 2024 election so highly advise everyone to keep in mind on this.,btohqsg

Pretty much. Now retiring happily smoking his cigar. He didn’t make much impact in improving the states of California when he’s governor,btohqsg
