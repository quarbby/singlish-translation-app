What happens if we waive MCPS ? Will they disqualify us or would we get a worst queue number?,btohqsg
Best to call hdb to understand the implications for your exact situation :),btohqsg
they will video call parents during the appointment?,btohqsg
what if parents not free? at work or something haha,btohqsg
Ermmm that im not sure sorry,btohqsg
Hi can I check if both of the parents are required to be present in the call?,btohqsg
just one of them is okay,btohqsg
hi all  can I clarify can essential occupier be one of the buyer for the BTO?,btohqsg
Normally is try not to use too many name(Owner). This is consider one property count and the next property will be 17% ABSD.,btohqsg
Also for the HLE  if the applicant is still in NS but his partner is already been working but not local  still can get HLE?,btohqsg
Is HLE letter required during booking date or signing of agreement lease date?,btohqsg
Hello If already booked flat selected unit and first HLE approved  and waiting for EGH and 2nd appt. If at this time I facing the possibility of a job change  will it affect anything with my application,btohqsg
Not like buy bto cannot change job like that,btohqsg
Just that u need the ehg access date pay slip,btohqsg
Means your current job pay slips make sure u have all those before u go,btohqsg
Later u left they don't want give u gg,btohqsg
In case they ask for more document for ehg,btohqsg
Need both of them to be present at the call.,btohqsg
During the 1st appointment  you can inform the officer that your parents are not available to take the call today. In my case  they were out of the country for vacation. HDB will follow up  via email  to arrange for a video call via whatsapp with parents  on another date.,btohqsg
Much appreciated  is it possible to waive the scheme. We weren't fully aware of the mop. My parents do prefer the flexibility to sell their current house within 10 years. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
No idea  you may need someone from HDB to answer this question.,btohqsg
Hi  can I just with everyone here.Is there anyone who works as food delivery rider(using bicycle) got rejected for the HLE...?,btohqsg
If working delivery rider or driver No CPF contribution HDB will nit approve the HLE.Is like do u dare to lend a stranger money $200K if he/she no full time job ?My brother is working as a food delivery rider which he every month just contribute some cash to his own CPF to at least show HDB have a constant $ in the CPF  the keys is *Constant*.What i suggest is if wants the HLE to get approved  then put Money in CPF now till the next HDB appointment.,btohqsg
Hi@Ahhow1990Having said that  do I not do a reapplication for the HLE  and just wait for the 1st appointment?At the same time  do a CPF contribution constantly.,btohqsg
Ya from now on u put Cash to CPF then show at 1st appointment now u have cpf. Then 2nd appointment come should be able to be approved,btohqsg
Self employed do have other kind of document to submit for hle,btohqsg
I believe  u can google online,btohqsg
I will inform him to do so. Thank you so much for this alternative.üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
I did try google  maybe i did not search enoughüòÖ,btohqsg
Hi..Sorry disturb..Any one have Woodlands Champion Bliss group chat?Thanks..,btohqsg
Hdb exempted student and NSF army guy from HLE,btohqsg
Till your 2nd or 3 appt will ask to apply HLE again based on the current jobs,btohqsg
U can find every info inhdhDB website,btohqsg
U mean options fee ? Is cash,btohqsg
Down payment is CPF if not enough top up cashBut down payment sure can one la  EHG all cover,btohqsg
If 1 not working and only 1 working sure can get almost max EHG to use for down payment of flat .Below 30 years old 5% of flat30 above 10% need to pay,btohqsg
Just wait for your grant to minus the down payment of cpf not enough lor,btohqsg
That's what happen to my friends that both do not have CPF lagi worse,btohqsg
hi everyone  can i check if downpayment is the full price  or is it minus EHG already?also is it 15% or 20%?,btohqsg
What u mean the full price ?,btohqsg
U can use ehg as part of your downpayment.If u go for hleBank loan downpayment  amount is different and need cash too,btohqsg
can i clarify then -if we are going for HLE  ehg will be disbursed first?and then ehg can be used as downpayment?,btohqsg
Down payment is 10% of the houseStaggered Downpayment is 5% of the houseEHG is EHG. Thats the grant you getThe number shown in the Downpayment is what you need to payYou can use EHG to pay for the Downpayment. It usually approves before the agreement for lease so that you can pay with your EHG for your Downpayment,btohqsg
i think coz of the cooling measures,btohqsg
staggered downpayment is 5% at first appt  15% at collection of keysnormal downpayment is 10% at first appt and 10% at collection of keys,btohqsg
so if i take hle  there is a chance that my cpf would not be affected as well as it's just deducted from ehg?,btohqsg
EHG will be credited to your CPF,btohqsg
And that gets priority to house payment,btohqsg
depends on how much your ehg is  it is credited to your CPF,btohqsg
yeah thats what i am confused!,btohqsg
