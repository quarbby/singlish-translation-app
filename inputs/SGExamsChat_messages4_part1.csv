which is when 'normal BMT' begins,btohqsg
Yeah you gotta know people and they gotta trust you. Also  internship shorter than 3 months is waste time.,btohqsg
Consider doing the intern after NS,btohqsg
You'll have time before uni starts anyway,btohqsg
smart  i wasted my 2 yrs :(,btohqsg
t u i t i o n,btohqsg
For me I voluntarily joined organising committee for an event and I'm trying to complete cs50,btohqsg
NS time is quite difficult for internships,btohqsg
So if you want to do something that helps you might want to consider something more adhoc,btohqsg
Something you can complete on your own time,btohqsg
if u tryin cs50 to prepare for comp sci,btohqsg
my fren did that and she dropped out of comp sci after the first sem,btohqsg
i would say is impt in seeing whether u like comp sci or not  but the rigour isnt similar,btohqsg
I'm doing a DDP anyway so if I do drop comp Sci I'll still have another major,btohqsg
And if I find out I hate my other major then lol I guess I'll die,btohqsg
I dont need to imagine  alrd there,btohqsg
Tbh one of the weeks it just went,btohqsg
Oh you know how to program C,btohqsg
ah seems like its almost same as mine  except that I'm DEFINITELY dropping the 2nd degree,btohqsg
u gonna go with the bond free scholarship,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t know you were in a DDP,btohqsg
oh wow toxic john strikes again,btohqsg
The scholarship doesn't go with the ddp?,btohqsg
I thought you were just in cs,btohqsg
@XenonShawnif you are awarded with it,btohqsg
The part I didn't know was,btohqsg
By right nus has the right to take away the scholarship,btohqsg
So I have no idea whether if I drop one of my degrees they'll let me continue,btohqsg
And my home degree is math rn so apparently I can only drop CS?,btohqsg
they said  highly likely its transferable,btohqsg
nah i think is possible to jump to cs,btohqsg
but is best to enquire to confirm,btohqsg
Idk which to pick between Cs and math anyway,btohqsg
so u are tryin to say its bad,btohqsg
If you're not officer  need waste more time with OCS,btohqsg
well at least we are debt free,btohqsg
Chances of me being an officer is practically zero,btohqsg
That doesn't answer whether you are in OFFR,btohqsg
Up to yall but all I can say is bond free scholarships are massively overrated by A-level equiv peeps,btohqsg
so is not that good la,btohqsg
which i agree to some extent,btohqsg
A bond scholarship would probably suit me more,btohqsg
But eh for now it'll do,btohqsg
are u entering uni this yr?,btohqsg
ah then u still have time,btohqsg
Then I realise I hate children,btohqsg
most ppl on bond free scholarship offers last yr didn't get interviewed right,btohqsg
ye man take MOE TS and go to private tuition industry once bond ends :),btohqsg
my chemistry teacher inspired me to do that,btohqsg
cos he was an irl example,btohqsg
