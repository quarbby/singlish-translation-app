Agree bro. To add on  98.9% of the FY20 revenue is from the Singapore operations but that is maybe like 10 months of actual revenue due to the CB. They recently started their Malaysia operation in Dec 2020 and I think that will alleviate some of the concentration risk in Singapore. I am vested so my views might be biased so dyodd,btohqsg
If it still exist in long term,btohqsg
Don’t see much alleviation since MCO after MCO lol,btohqsg
hmmm which period are you referring to? Malaysia too many MCO liao,btohqsg
U referring fy2020 bulk is sg revenue but they starting their biz in msia to alleviate concentration risk. Also no visibility how to start. Just waiting boss do something don’t slack,btohqsg
Grateful if any kind soul can tell me which brokerage charges zero comms for local share transactions listed here; I small trader  the high comms I have been paying eats into any gain  or increases my losses,btohqsg
Zero comm can turn u profitable?,btohqsg
I believe that eventually it will because 98.9% extremely high,btohqsg
It increase your lossMeans u are loss makingGive u zero comm let u die faster onlySelf reflect.,btohqsg
Well it’s a sg company. Not surprisedChange msia bossI just want a msia bb,btohqsg
Painful but he got his point right,btohqsg
I just want it to fly hahahaha,btohqsg
If U can be profitable with zero comm go sign up as prop trader with cimb,btohqsg

Everyone who plans to huat a lot should also have the worst case scenario in mind. Nothing is confirmed. Play micros   if Stucked need to wait very long.,btohqsg

Lol think he/she might cursing furion now,btohqsg
Want to play   play those micros I highlighted. The prices in bracket safe to collect   for now. Collect already need to hold and be patient. Don’t complain why never move . Lol. It’s a waiting game . I only know the safe price to collect. Spotted those accumulation by BBs already.,btohqsg
But I don’t think furion is bad. Just that he seem new to here and he might cannot take it since he did not respond after.,btohqsg
Ya furion is not bad la...he is actually not bad la...err...what?,btohqsg
Lol Furion bad meh? Furion tells you the truth and the truth hurts lor 🙈,btohqsg
For me I will just take it with a pinch of salt. Can’t expect everyone to treat you or to be what you expect to be..,btohqsg
