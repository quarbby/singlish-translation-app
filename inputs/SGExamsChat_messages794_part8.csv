"On a daily basis I consume enough drugs to sedate Manhattan  Long Island  and Queens for a month. I take Quaaludes 10-15 times a day for my ""back pain""  Adderall to stay focused  Xanax to take the edge off  pot to mellow me out  cocaine to wake me back up again  and morphine... Well  because it's awesome. But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven  here is one that is my absolute favorite. See  enough of this shit will make you invincible - able to conquer the world. And eviscerate your enemies.",btohqsg
