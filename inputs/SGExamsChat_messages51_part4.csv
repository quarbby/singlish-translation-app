i flying overseas within these 2-3 years,btohqsg
so desktop will be a waste,btohqsg
no one will use when i leave,btohqsg
U know that you can move the desktop over,btohqsg
A gaming laptop is only practical if you move around often,btohqsg
Is long enough to warrant a pc imo,btohqsg
Its probably too bulky to be practical,btohqsg
I mean you‚Äôd just have to move it once,btohqsg
no such thing as thin and can run intensive?,btohqsg
Assuming it‚Äôs a long term stay,btohqsg
gaming laptopsnevercome thin  as far as i know,btohqsg
if you want sleek and thin  you could go imac but they're bad for intensive gaming,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too,btohqsg
If you are gonna spend 4k on a laptop,btohqsg
If they are  they can't cool components well,btohqsg
U might as well just buy a desktop,btohqsg
And more cost effective in the long term,btohqsg
You could even buy a decent laptop w the money leftover,btohqsg
Why? For laptops  you have to replace the whole machine to keep up with modern titles,btohqsg
maybe wait a few years then got thin but stronk gaming lappy alr,btohqsg
For desktops  at least you can change the GPU only,btohqsg
i think your best option is to cryofreeze yourself and tell the operator to unfreeze u when we invent better cooling mechanisms üëçüëç,btohqsg
if you didn't want lightweight i would've recommended Lenovo Legion Y7000,btohqsg
it's my computer and it's good for gaminc but its heavy,btohqsg
I'm just fooling around  not tryna be passive aggressive or anything üòÇ,btohqsg
wait I think they use a similar chassis,btohqsg
i saw a razer blade 17 with gtx 1080 but its out of stock üòÇ,btohqsg
Unless you rly want that raytracing tech,btohqsg
Most AAA tittles can b handled,btohqsg
Idt they sell laptops with gtx 1080 anymore,btohqsg
Meanwhile me with my gtx 740,btohqsg
Honestly ive never seen laptops sold w 1080,btohqsg
razer blade 17 acer predator helios 500 i think,btohqsg
Oh no  I have combat circuit tmr,btohqsg
eh anyone know how to ask nus to,btohqsg
cuz now I'm offered DDP + USP and idw to die in uni,btohqsg
Tbh if DDP+USP is doable in 5 years,btohqsg
But if plan to rush in 4 years you should drop USP,btohqsg
Yeah probs email them  but when the offical semsester starts you will have another chance to drop it,btohqsg
tbh I'm confused at how it works lol  can u use ur UEs on USP and stuff?,btohqsg
UEs are basically mods which you take to fill up the space of 160mcs,btohqsg
Basically they are mods that take up any extra space you need to fill,btohqsg
If your double degree has enough mods and you already hit your graduation requirements then technically there‚Äôs no need for you to take any UEs,btohqsg
Ah  so the double degree and USP mods will contribute to the 160mc?,btohqsg
then technically it's the same workload with or without USP what hahaha why ppl say it's insane,btohqsg
@adminscan i see the rules message,btohqsg
they do  just that it's hard to find them,btohqsg
Why not try all at once and then drop one degree later on if you can't handle,btohqsg
Then you default to your primary degree anyway,btohqsg
Tbh I'm thinking of joining one RC,btohqsg
