Wear makeup not to impress ppl... most of the time is for yourself one la,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think people wear makeup to impress others though,btohqsg
yes mr smith! ill do anything for that A!,btohqsg
at home i dont impress myself go out impress myself for wad,btohqsg
thats my line of thinking at least,btohqsg
some ppl dont think liddat a,btohqsg
makeup is more like to look good and feel good lah,btohqsg
but not necessarily to  ‚Äúimpress‚Äù others,btohqsg
its either a wgt argument or a 'i wanna look presentable' argument,btohqsg
what are the impacts of a partial lockdown for students,btohqsg
i just stay at home and watch lectures/ tutorials that‚Äôs all right,btohqsg
singapore lockdown = businesses affected = money loss = economy recession,btohqsg
H3 econs ppl pls... big brain energy,btohqsg
No but i know from my senior lol,btohqsg
and once we get through this period  it will take quite a while for businesses to pick up again,btohqsg
If u are good at self studying yes,btohqsg
Why so many SPF here sia,btohqsg

But then the workload a bit high tier tho,btohqsg
Hmmm. We start work at 9  sometimes there's training in the afternoon. But we sleep overnight. Then end work around 11/12,btohqsg
I'd rather do that than FI,btohqsg
Shop for essentials yes  anything else no,btohqsg
When we go law they can just sleep,btohqsg
Anyone knows if can go library study anot?,btohqsg
Not essential service just stay at home LOL,btohqsg
Wtf is it so hard to stay at home,btohqsg
At home I always end up getting distracted so I prefer to study in the library.... but now just stay home,btohqsg
Thats your problem  don't turn your lack of discipline into society's problem tyvm pls just stay at home,btohqsg
Oh really? Damn that sounds lepak,btohqsg

Tbh I'd go for it  but my FI says he regrets it,btohqsg

You can leave your house unless you have Stay-At-Home notice,btohqsg
If you think it'll help you focus  then just take sufficient precautionary measures,btohqsg
Chill bruh can just say normally,btohqsg
Shn now want to go out also can't,btohqsg
Can't even step out of room,btohqsg
It's not a good line of reasoning though,btohqsg
"""Oh you have no discipline  it's your own problem""",btohqsg
He never link premise to conclusion,btohqsg
I should go to wet markets and berate all the aunties for crowding there,btohqsg
He just in isolation say study at home harder,btohqsg
when they can opt for online delivery,btohqsg
"""Don't make their problem my problem or society problem  they don't understand how to use apps not my problem""  sounds pretty dick-ish",btohqsg
Eh actually can do the equivalent of berating no?,btohqsg
ya... true.... but desperate times call for desperate measures... as long as don't kenna covid then happy already üò∑,btohqsg
yeah i think they just haven't done that because we're not DORSCON red,btohqsg

Hope won't go to that extent,btohqsg
But if need be then so be it,btohqsg

Invest in the company that makes sanitizers tbh,btohqsg
past pandemics were living evidence what,btohqsg
since when u invest equities one,btohqsg

no money buy shares then play options lor,btohqsg
probably gonna wait till it hits 2.2k,btohqsg
I actually wanna invest  I just dk how and where,btohqsg
i suggest not if u dunno what u doing,btohqsg
the animal crossing grind never stops sia,btohqsg
i‚Äôm going to sneak my switch into camp and play animal crossing daily,btohqsg
Then you only left with the gov one?,btohqsg
What's ur field for internship har,btohqsg
animal crossing will charge me with wholesome energy so i can manoeuvre the tiresome world of national service,btohqsg
Then the gov one is what kind,btohqsg
also i can make an ocs singlet inside animal crossing if i don‚Äôt get one irl,btohqsg
You can make it even if you do get in,btohqsg
then i‚Äôll do a double flex...,btohqsg
how is being pes c a flex...,btohqsg
Does it require a lot of human interaction,btohqsg
I would think it does but not sure,btohqsg
we all playing tgt idt anyone gna sell,btohqsg
considering one of their employees got infected with COVID  no surprise,btohqsg
then how is that a bad choice? 0.0,btohqsg
anyone know if private tuition is still legal next week,btohqsg
Should not be fine  the tutor can be a potential vector  a transient being,btohqsg
Ask the tutor take temp first lorh,btohqsg
Govt already admit asymptomatic theory alr,btohqsg
aiya just spray disinfectant on the tutor can alr/s,btohqsg
as the tutor I am 19,btohqsg
Liddat might as well circuit breaker for 2 months,btohqsg
Large group then no choice need zoom,btohqsg
a bit hard leh my wifi at home so jialut I am on mobile data all the time,btohqsg
Who use insta live for tuition,btohqsg
I mean if you don‚Äôt mind the possibility of you being the person that spreads the virus from your family to the tutee  or the tutee to your family or tutee A to tutee B then go ahead lor,btohqsg
Wat if the issue is not you,btohqsg
Then through you the student spread to the other students,btohqsg
not sure if it's enough for 1.5X6 hours video calls a week plus everything,btohqsg
John Smith's wisdom is always eternal and all seeing,btohqsg
I suggest u discuss with both student and parents,btohqsg
Anyone here has tried atkins or dukans diet before?,btohqsg
But it needs meat  and you're vegetarian,btohqsg
Cb i get more protein than the steroid chicken they give sia,btohqsg
It'll help recompose your body from fats to muscle,btohqsg
Plus i dont have limitstions on how much i can take,btohqsg
High protein low carbs high fibre low fats,btohqsg
I haven't heard of Atkins before  su can't say much on it,btohqsg
Is the same just that got a bit fats,btohqsg
This would be perfect for your situation,btohqsg
You can get that on your cheat day lmao,btohqsg
There's another one called paleo if I'm not mistaken which helps with weight loss,btohqsg
But you need a fuck ton of eggs for that,btohqsg
I need to see whats possible w incamp food,btohqsg
Dukan's  you just eat the proteins and limit the rest,btohqsg
Eh yeah  so much swimming and pt,btohqsg
But as much as possible dont travel unless needed,btohqsg
U can technically still do anything you want,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs HBL and WFH,btohqsg
So that the traffic will be much much reduced,btohqsg
So the people who really need to go to work can safely take PT,btohqsg
The only good thing from lockdown,btohqsg
Is we are saving the environment,btohqsg
People with cars aren‚Äôt really affected,btohqsg
Reminds me of how some cities in China saw clear skies for the first time this pandemic,btohqsg
Guess it will be cloudy in 3 weeks time,btohqsg
Haven't figured out what to do with it yet,btohqsg
I assembled 2 lego sets i got for Christmas,btohqsg
I do nonograms on my phone now,btohqsg
In SAF the exams don‚Äôt get cancelled,btohqsg
They tell u how many squares r black in a row n u must figure out which of the squares are the black ones,btohqsg
They gave us like 10 topics in 4 days,btohqsg
Study doesn‚Äôt mean you will pass,btohqsg
In my course  1 fail = confine 1 day in camp and retake,btohqsg
2 fail = out of course,btohqsg
Spf u fail means u go shit vocation,btohqsg
2 fail you get one last chance  after that you out of course,btohqsg
I dont rmb passing a single exam in SAF,btohqsg
Anyway I think we must stop now,btohqsg
I had an aircraft recognition exam,btohqsg
I had to get 36 out of 40 planes correct,btohqsg
No shit am i passing that,btohqsg
Damn saf exams r so much harder relative to spf,btohqsg
Which species do u belong to,btohqsg
He prob belongs to natural selection,btohqsg
Do 10 push ups every hour,btohqsg
Its essential for my detrimental lifestyle,btohqsg
He is actually visibly old now,btohqsg
That was my first reaction when i saw the broadcast today,btohqsg
The soon to be MM Lee,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the title LKY took after retiring,btohqsg
My soon is another 100 yrs,btohqsg
Your soon is in Kranji camp,btohqsg
Reason why i said 100 years,btohqsg
Message from Jokerlayou888 deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
I had a mozzie bite me,btohqsg
Is the only reason why I‚Äôm up so early,btohqsg
Breaking the circuit of my sleep,btohqsg
Everyone seems to be saying that for some reason,btohqsg
Circuit breaker is basically code red with extra steps,btohqsg
What if social media sites like Telegram spread coronavirus too,btohqsg
What if someone is playing Plague Inc. irl and he's waiting to upgrade all the means of infection,btohqsg
nope his clearing investing all his assets into not being able to find a cure for the virusü•¥,btohqsg
should make a COVID good morning starter pack,btohqsg
Tfw we in dorscon red but orange cos 1 criteria wasn't fulfilled,btohqsg
Remember it's circuit breaker  not lockdown,btohqsg
Gotta package it well to prevent the uneducated masses from panicking,btohqsg
Just like those people going house to house for nonessential trips,btohqsg
"yea i think should be okay for me since currently i only got 2 ""active"" students",btohqsg
i try not to do online cause one my laptop is crashy two it will be too costly in terms of mobile data,btohqsg
That doesn‚Äôt make it ok to do so,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs not ok then you shouldn‚Äôt do it  end of discussion,btohqsg
i think just take precautionary measures ah wear mask and bring hand sanitiser,btohqsg
The risk isn‚Äôt just to you and the student,btohqsg
If we want others to stay home and avoid nonessential things,btohqsg
It only makes sense that we do so ourselves too,btohqsg
I thought you had 4 phDs,btohqsg
So you‚Äôre fine with people coming out to visit their friends within their neighbourhood then,btohqsg
"idk lah i cannot just make it ""online or we cancel"" if i do that i can eat grass",btohqsg
Essential workers have to go to work,btohqsg
Essential = goNonessential = don‚Äôt go out,btohqsg
Some say buy lottery essential... üòÇ,btohqsg
Government's definition of essential is different from every individual's definition,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to have a common one,btohqsg
To your average 50 year old mother  shopping groceries at the wet market isabsolutely essential,btohqsg
Then govt stay home is different from individual stay home definition,btohqsg
Some say their Fren house is also home. Haha,btohqsg
Anyone has any nice smartphone games to recommend?,btohqsg
Is condo pool and gym banned?,btohqsg
condo not sure  but prob closed too,btohqsg
its the size of pulau semakau,btohqsg
I don't want full HBL üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Does from 8 April mean there's school on Wednesday or no sch on Wednesday itself,btohqsg
I think no sch on wed,btohqsg
So 4th is the last day,btohqsg
Basically dorscon red but without the colour,btohqsg
Prelims the only time u get real exam format,btohqsg
If hbl continues beyond 4 May I can‚Äôt imagine what they can do after syllabus ends,btohqsg
Plus u have to get hardcopy noes for hbl,btohqsg
Imagine the amount of notes u have to bring home,btohqsg
Basically have to bring one big lump sum of money,btohqsg
My FM junior‚Äôs teacher gave them the notes for the rest of the year before HBL was even announced,btohqsg
Give them pre-read time if they bored,btohqsg
notes this week gonna rip me a new one,btohqsg
Ye my batch one quite big tho,btohqsg
I think sooner or later moe will abolish the sub again,btohqsg
Then why tf they make H2 math more ez to study lol,btohqsg
Might as well add back haha,btohqsg
Cause they brought some of the stuff to fm now mah,btohqsg
When they abolish fm they will change the syllabus for h2 math again,btohqsg
I see some trend for the syllabus thing,btohqsg
Moving the things into FM doesn‚Äôt mean they have to move it back,btohqsg
And the last J1s to take the old H2 math was 2015 batch,btohqsg
Then now our formula sheet is MF26,btohqsg
I mean thats like the old h2 math,btohqsg
Will it change a lot for the 2026,btohqsg
Like it matches with the formula sheet number lol,btohqsg
FM to be cancelled in 2026 confirmed,btohqsg
According to the mathematical formula 15 theory,btohqsg
J1s in 2026 will be the last for the current H2 math syllabus,btohqsg
So they update every 9 years,btohqsg
They should remove contrasting sub policy,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt just put the MF number for no reason,btohqsg
It was popular last time coz no contrasting,btohqsg
Yeah and aircraft manufacturers can‚Äôt just name their aircrafts KC 135 for no reason,btohqsg
Basically those who dun want triple science,btohqsg
And the Air Force can‚Äôt just name their squadrons 123 124 for no reason,btohqsg
Time to low key fail the safety exam,btohqsg
Yea lol at least the 12 part has a reason,btohqsg
1 is like just the group of planes in general,btohqsg
The last number I dun know lol,btohqsg
It would‚Äôve been way easier if they just told us that,btohqsg
But we know the AELG squadrons have number pattern,btohqsg
8 is just engineers in general,btohqsg
So 807 squadron is the AELG squadron in PLAB,btohqsg
So it does have a pattern,btohqsg
Some of us can become participation command,btohqsg
I hope I dun be one of them,btohqsg
Then dun even have a cockpit to check,btohqsg
while students and employees stay homearmy personnel isolate in camp ah fml,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt afford for the military to get sick,btohqsg
yikes they just announced a 6th death,btohqsg
u choosing to stay or go home,btohqsg
I think might as well go home. Sooner or later Govt will force NUS to evict us.,btohqsg
Any1 knows how to fix windows stuck at attempting repair?,btohqsg
I tried undervolting -100mv and it went to a blue screen,btohqsg
If it is eternally stuck most likely it‚Äôs broken beyond use without manual repair,btohqsg
It was fine until i tried undervolting,btohqsg
NUS is giving the option of move out by Tuesday or don‚Äôt go home for the entirety of circuit breaker if you decide to stay (advisory but incentivised by no refund for early checkout beyond Tuesday),btohqsg
But it‚Äôs all online now right,btohqsg
bruh the streets are so lively now,btohqsg
So there‚Äôs no benefit for living close to school now,btohqsg
imagine being chased out of your campus,btohqsg
people clearly aren't taking circuit breaker seriously,btohqsg
orchard road is a ghost town  no meh,btohqsg
We‚Äôre being chased out of our bunks,btohqsg
as in  your average bedok town,btohqsg
actually SAF loves to keep you in camp,btohqsg
But then this is assuming Govt won‚Äôt later say: ‚ÄúNo NUS  you can‚Äôt give them a choice  kick‚Äôem out‚Äù,btohqsg
Its more emptier than usual in my neighbourhood,btohqsg
idk ah  maybe bedok is just stupid,btohqsg
The toto queue longer than the ntuc queue LOOOOOOOOOOL,btohqsg
I can see that its more lifeless than usual  at least around where I stay,btohqsg
I had to be physically there,btohqsg
Should i stock up on foolscap paper,btohqsg
Like im left w 1pad at home,btohqsg
Buy a month‚Äôs worth at least,btohqsg
If it runs out then i have no where todo my work.. and like they‚Äôre gonna be closing down alotta stuff,btohqsg
Nothing to write on  he means,btohqsg
