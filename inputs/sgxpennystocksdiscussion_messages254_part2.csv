Company transferred the company domicile from Bermuda to Singapore & diversified into fund management & investment business. I believe SG domicile company will be able to comply with MAS regulations. So hope this investment business can bring in profit for Shen Yao. What I don't like is too many share outstanding (32.71bn) for the company. However 70% shares r belong to Yaoo Capital (55.06%) Sheng Investment (15.29%) so I would think that this share may move one day...,btohqsg
Company domicile in Bermuda should have a lot of restrictions   so when the domicile transferred to SG  should be easier for the company to do business especially in fund management business. This is jz my views....,btohqsg
Firstly is whether for MAS licenseSecondly a lot of companies registered Bermuda bvi for ease of business.,btohqsg
Maybe u are the one eating his stake. Still have 30m to go.,btohqsg

Ah chan offload 1st thing in new year! 7.6mil shares,btohqsg
Ah Chan is one of the BB I feel... My own view,btohqsg
Ya  suppose to be good news.... Drop 40% this week  including pre open,btohqsg
Gd news meh? U buy things...cash flow will reduce,btohqsg
Usually acquisition will make share price fall.....disposal at profiy will make price go up...,btohqsg
