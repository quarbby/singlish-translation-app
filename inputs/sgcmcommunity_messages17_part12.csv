Have u tested the RFID and EzlinkTNG?,btohqsg
U mean nfc tng? I never buy rfid sticker,btohqsg
Tiagong that one deducts from ur E wallet not physical card. For Physical card if go watson then will deduct.,btohqsg
Hello king  i think we have communication issues. I only have new tng card (nfc) and ezlink/tng card. New tng card is top up ewallet via cc then transfer to card (done). Paydirect in stores never try before.,btohqsg
Exchange rate good? Pay direct tiagong is watson only for now.,btohqsg
Pls check with your credit card issuing bank for forex rates üôè,btohqsg
i got the rfid sticker but i could not activate it. it says rejected and customer service sucks. no replies noboyd helped,btohqsg
i am dreaming of this one. like a theater,btohqsg
GG sia. why like that people get activate fast,btohqsg
I know is too late to ask about this but where is the results release at? I scroll but can‚Äôt findüòÖ,btohqsg
have you been talking? the idea is to chat a lot here  short of spamming.,btohqsg
you can talk cars  performance mazda and sort,btohqsg
I just join recently and not very active since was occupied with work,btohqsg
alright welcome. start talking. then you get prizes. some say dash cams next to come,btohqsg
you can irritate many here by talking mazda only. unknowingly you will talk more as you defend,btohqsg
that is how i got my prize. i blast all things mazda. they got angry... haha,btohqsg
oh you are mazda 6 owner like me. the car is simply fabulos. best japanese car i have had,btohqsg
Yuppp hahaha  did optional Machine Grey paint and equip with BOSE speaker as entertainmentüòúBut i‚Äôm more towards driving Alphard now  prefer the safety features  comfortable and height,btohqsg
is yours a 2.5? what year,btohqsg
mine is dec 2015 face lift model.,btohqsg
"what is ""optional machine grey paint""?",btohqsg
wow yours is a gvc skyactiv,btohqsg
You know the Soul Red Crystal and Machine Grey that need add additional $2K for it?,btohqsg
no i didnt know. i bought a used car,btohqsg
in january 2022. only 4 months plus old i had,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt have gvc for mine,btohqsg
what fuel consumption did you get,btohqsg
i got 750 km for 56 liters of fuel average,btohqsg
GVC should be those after 2019 model,btohqsg
i use istop all the time,btohqsg
so you have another car alphard? it is huge,btohqsg
Ya i drive Alphard as my main for now2019 SC,btohqsg
Shd measure by cities  not countries,btohqsg
Theyll rip you off. Especially Amex,btohqsg
Use you trip   no bank commission and exchange rate is market rate,btohqsg
So far yes.Revolut is another one. Got quite a lot of cash back on that card too,btohqsg
So it can be used to top up E wallet?,btohqsg
Ya revolut best for withdrawing cash overseas. Best rates so far,btohqsg
Using Revolut more than Youtrip these days. Cause iPhone can use Apple pay to top up the account quickly.,btohqsg
Haven't heard of them for a long time,btohqsg
I think mostly cause YouTrip was made by EZ-Link and well EZ-link is struggling to focus their EZ-Link efforts now. No time for YouTrip,btohqsg
Youtrip money can go in but cannot come out,btohqsg
I use Wise for that reason,btohqsg
Citi bank instant top up for me,btohqsg
Actually youtrip was collaborated with ezlink.. then ezlink left.,btohqsg
New youtrip cards iirc does not have ezlink logo on it,btohqsg
I have checked. Sometimes dbs remit is better,btohqsg
Actually it‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt acknowledge that different ppl like different things and not to put others choice down that didn‚Äôt go well not because you like Mazda ‚Ä¶.ü´¢,btohqsg
Just to clear things up  you were chosen to win the prize because you were the most engaging member (not because you blasted all things Mazda)üòÑHope this clarifies!,btohqsg
Admin no deals from Honda so far ?,btohqsg
