"ya  after I put bc everytime I take a slow sharp turn I tot my wheel gonna ""dislocate"" anytime ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
but okay la depends what youâ€™re really looking for i guess ?,btohqsg
too stiff for street also not forgiving,btohqsg
imagine driving on cte towards sle at 90,btohqsg
hahahahaha my friend had track setup on his type r and my butt leaves the seat everytime I drive over uneven road,btohqsg
Can try ksport sport itâ€™s quite comfortable,btohqsg
your 17kg spring rate can make my spine break,btohqsg
I don't find mine to be that harsh leh... Maybe the car heavy,btohqsg
Or my butt got more meat to absorb,btohqsg
My bro mazda 6  i find super hard,btohqsg
I also don't know whether their adjusted to soft or stiff. Just drove the car as it was when I bought it,btohqsg
But tyre pressure also can play a part,btohqsg
For me 33 to 35psi it nice. Anything more it becomes bouncy,btohqsg
no it's not mine it's a friend's one ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I saw it at takashimaya carpark last year taking photos,btohqsg
ahhh I wanted to change to 004 howâ€™s the review of that tyre ?,btohqsg
I actually don't know what to compare it to,btohqsg
I using 004. Raining cannot corner or drive fast,btohqsg
My previous car I just use normal tyres,btohqsg
I'll need to try those on the car first,btohqsg
AD08 in wet also scared the shit out of me,btohqsg
But I never had any problems with the re004,btohqsg
Maybe just my driving style no issues,btohqsg
cuz I head supposed to be not bad though RE004,btohqsg
Rain I don't corner fast la,btohqsg
Nice. I bought mine when got discount,btohqsg
ofcourse ah .. but like aquaplanning all ok?,btohqsg
I try China type before. Not bad at first. After that cmi.,btohqsg
Other then enter puddles whole car slows down,btohqsg
Corners  I think the LSD will kick in to help,btohqsg
okay la usually push when dry,btohqsg
Wet weather potenza sport is better than re004 and ps4,btohqsg
I will try the endurance then I let u guys know,btohqsg
Anyone try PS5? Heard itâ€™s out Liao,btohqsg
But dry weather re004 is better for cornering in my opinion,btohqsg
Re004 is only one direction if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
So can only rotate wheels once,btohqsg
I thought sport is supposed to be uuhp,btohqsg
Together w csc6 ps4s and f1ss,btohqsg
While re004 is uhp tgt w ps4 f1a5 etc,btohqsg
PS4S when reach to a point of heat will start to lose grip alr though,btohqsg
Yup they are of same category,btohqsg
Just find re004 more aggressive in dry compared to potenza sport,btohqsg
I might continue with re004 in future cuz to me it looks good on the car ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
try RE71R next ah . Dry sibeh solid,btohqsg
okay ah not as bad as AD08,btohqsg
keep it under 100 lo in rain,btohqsg
Went from ps4 to re004 to potenza sport,btohqsg
AD08 technology very old Liao â€¦ so canâ€™t be compared to newer tyres,btohqsg
I think 71R now have the 71RS version  maybe can try that,btohqsg
