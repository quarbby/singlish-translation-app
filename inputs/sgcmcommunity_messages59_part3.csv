Backfires and afterfires are worth paying attention to since they can cause engine damage  power loss  and decreased fuel efficiency. There's a variety of factors that can cause your car to backfire  but the most common ones are having a poor air to fuel ratio  a misfiring spark plug  or good old-fashioned bad timing.12 Feb 2020https://www.firestonecompleteautocare.com› ...Why Do Cars Backfire? | Firestone Complete Auto Care,btohqsg
insert a spark plug just before the tip,btohqsg
Rich refers to the mixture of fuel and air not the octane itself,btohqsg
for fire to come out need stagger timing,btohqsg
up the fuel per cm cube of air,btohqsg
Rich would mean that you your fuel to air ratio is high,btohqsg
i.e.  more fuel for amount of air,btohqsg
rich also means you got too much money to spend on petrol,btohqsg
Everytime I start car  there’s always a burst of gasoline smell,btohqsg
just programme to spark when let of the throttle,btohqsg
no means u nvr put cats,btohqsg
To run rich  you must be rich,btohqsg
