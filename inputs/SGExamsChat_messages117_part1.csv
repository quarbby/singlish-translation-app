Eng no more than D7Math (e/a) no more than C62 more subject both no more than C6,btohqsg
Unless someone really aims for ite,btohqsg
But i highly doubt people in o level will aim that,btohqsg
Rmb my friend who got 21 whom his place got revoked  ? He went ITE to pursue biotechnology,btohqsg
He said alot of ppl got 15-18 l1b2,btohqsg
Cuz of English / Math being a fail they go there,btohqsg
15-18 but fail english/math go ite,btohqsg
Yeah i think math and english damn important,btohqsg
I mean ite provide tution for Os,btohqsg
Hi everyone!

Mark the event on your calendar and follow this thread/our Instagram (@sgexams) for the livestream link closer to the event!Rules and Guidelines,btohqsg
oh that actually looks pretty cool,btohqsg
I have admin powers once again,btohqsg
hey don't unpin the panel stuff :(,btohqsg
idk why im still here on the tele group,btohqsg
How do you have power to pin,btohqsg
Wait since when are you admin,btohqsg
I gave you so many useful suggestions,btohqsg
To clarify  it's 5 pax for live interactions where we won't restrict you from chatting with them. It's also to maximize the sense of intimacy for viewers. It's gonna be livestreamed via YouTube too  so you can also use that platform to ask qns  which will be conveyed to panelists via moderator.,btohqsg
U have to do python then Arduino.-.,btohqsg
you should just send the qn here actl,btohqsg
But but tis not qns grp,btohqsg
i wanna try fenty but SOOO EX,btohqsg
But I use that nth really happened,btohqsg
i saw on yt this girl used the bourgoui or smth xiao cheap she say damn good,btohqsg
dude innis free stuff are like,btohqsg
but the other products like xiao urmst,btohqsg
maybe try writing some pseudo code first?,btohqsg
it's code  but write in english,btohqsg
get the high level logic down in paper first,btohqsg
As in...logically break down the steps you think is required to achieve that objective,btohqsg
This is the pseudocode for Sieve of Eratosthenesalgorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes isinput: an integer n > 1.output: all prime numbers from 2 through n.let A be an array of Boolean values  indexed by integers 2 to n initially all set to true.for i = 2  3  4  ...  not exceeding √n doif A[i] is truefor j = i2  i2+i  i2+2i  i2+3i  ...  not exceeding n doA[j] := falsereturn all i such that A[i] is true.,btohqsg
So even though it's not like in Python or whatever  you should be able to decipher what it is saying,btohqsg
Is that even taught in computing,btohqsg
Cause its just writing code in eng,btohqsg
It’s like slang for coding languages,btohqsg
Cuz I went to do this tho,btohqsg
Can just say if intResult is even lol,btohqsg
I was confused at first HAHAHHAA,btohqsg
I vvv use to it alr,btohqsg
I only know abit of js,btohqsg
Not used to short forms HAHA,btohqsg
Paiseh I tend to type in short,btohqsg
take in inputif input is evendo thiselsedo that,btohqsg
then go figure how to implement the code inside the is even part and the is odd part,btohqsg
Var result = Console.ReadLine();int intResult = int.Parse(result);,btohqsg
no idea what lang you using ,btohqsg
Btw I delete the qns cuz I scared my classmate report to cher HAHAHA,btohqsg
as long as it takes in the input then yeah can,btohqsg
