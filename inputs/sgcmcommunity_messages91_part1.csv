the owner bought the car when the COE was at 80k. so does that mean he can recoup a bit by selling it now since the coe is high?,btohqsg
but if you buying a new car then no diff since coe also high,btohqsg
yea... so maybe he is thinking of getting a more affordable one....,btohqsg
Fluctuations in COE don't change much to him,btohqsg
Very small part of his total price,btohqsg
still have to count in depreciation road tax servicing fuel,btohqsg
recoup is recoup la  but marginal compared to what he spend over the past year not including the car price,btohqsg
