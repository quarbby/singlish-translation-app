Also un recognised Israel palestine as a genocide today,btohqsg
But not the 1st half coz i no translation,btohqsg
I cant even read chinese anymoreüò¢,btohqsg
Oh wow I only heard about the UNSC ceasefire vote but not thisFrom an online articleA UN human rights expert will deliver a report on Tuesday saying thatIsraelhas carried out acts of genocide in Gaza and should be placed under an arms embargo.Francesca Albanese the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories said in her report there were ‚Äúreasonable grounds‚Äù to believe that Israel was carrying out three of the five acts defined as genocide: killing Palestinians  causing them serious bodily or mental harm  and ‚Äúdeliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction‚Äù of the population in whole or in part.,btohqsg
Yeah it's factually a genocide tbf,btohqsg
"By all objective standards of what a ""genocide"" is",btohqsg
Yeah even if Israel was not the aggressor,btohqsg
But im on my period so,btohqsg
Rand what did you wanna post,btohqsg
Eh but legit why I‚Äôm curious to know your views,btohqsg
We can have a civil discussion without Josh,btohqsg
My opinion isJust like all other conflicts happening over the same fucking reasonAll of this is stupid,btohqsg
It's just a waste of like everything,btohqsg
I feel like our generation will be part of ww3,btohqsg
But it is a genocide cuz there is proven intent to harm a minority group protected under the convention based on the 5 criterion of destruction,btohqsg
Too much instability around the world,btohqsg
"U unironically can't rly dispute thatMaybe you can like say that there is no ""deliberate targeting"" but thats abt it",btohqsg
"Rn the only reason why its disputed as a ""genocide"" is cause you cant actually prove that israel is choosing to deliberately hunt down palestinians LOL",btohqsg
china plans to invade taiwan by 2047,btohqsg
And China keeps saying that they wanna invade Taiwan cuz US is putting their forces in Japan and Australia to protect taiwanSo now we just playing brinkmanship and security dilemma until someone CRACKS,btohqsg
Oh so it‚Äôs just the only technicality that could prevent it from being officially classified as one,btohqsg
in all genocides the hardest thing to prove is intent,btohqsg
Might have a change of plan since Xi won‚Äôt last forever I guess  perhaps the next leader won‚Äôt be as nationalist,btohqsg
Im basing it off what Xi said,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt get enough of it in my office since I‚Äôm a light sleeper,btohqsg
Meh just get it done and over with. But I suppose now that the pw syllabus is watered down the curriculum time allocated has been reduced?,btohqsg
I stand by the fact that PW can be finshed in a week,btohqsg
"1) Hamas hides bombs under a pile of vegetables in baskets  then they try to get children to carry from one place to another; into people's houses  then kena bombed  and thhey do hide bombs in the UN facilities as well2) do you ever wonder why they wear civilian clothes to fight  and not let the ppl leave the country? It is to accuse israel of genocide  so this is essentially the human shields  if they care about the palestinians so much won't they bring the palestinians hide inside the tunnels?3) they prioritise the tunnel ventilations  not the hospitals4) Majority of the aid goes to hamas  not the civilians5) the education system in palestine is so rigged  always training children to hate the israelis  and getting the guys to be maytyred to commit jihad6) The funds thhat hamas gets is called ""financial jihad""7) From 1948 all the way israel is being attacked from the arab israeli war to yom kippur to 1st and 2nd intafada  why no protest at that time  why only now on 7 october?I know i am gonna get hated for this but these are my views",btohqsg
but i am gonna keep it like that for now,btohqsg
I wish I was born a bit later,btohqsg
Nah the last one you‚Äôre fine so long as Josh isn‚Äôt here. But from my POV ah  I was just looking up the definition of what a genocide was,btohqsg
Just cause its a genocide doesnt mean its wrong,btohqsg
:/ idk why people keep assigning value judgements on things which dont actually need value judements,btohqsg
"objective standpoint technically if we go by international borders standards  whatever is happening you can kinda argue that palestine isnt fighting for the wrong cause. Their methods of fighting are just fucked upPeople just choose to associate the ""death and killing"" as like a way of passing blame to someone? Which tbf is kind of a stupid thing but understandable in most contexts (because we all grow up with the mindset that so long as you display physical violence you will always be in the wrong)",btohqsg
which is kinda dumb la the notion,btohqsg
"what makes things worse is that people refuse to acknowledge this as an overall humanitarian crisis as a result tbf because theyre like""ohh technically hamas caused everything therefore its not a humanitarian crisis cause they deserve it""Which is like okay but we can separate the state powers from the people from the morality of the issue? but idk why no one does that lol",btohqsg
I feel like I need to talk to the school counsellor but Idk,btohqsg
I dont know what to say,btohqsg
Should I write down what I feel on a paper and give her?,btohqsg
eh but rlly thank you for giving me the space for this type of contentious discussion,btohqsg
ive been getting sick way more often than usual,btohqsg
you can always take gap years,btohqsg
Yeah tbh it‚Äôs hard to draw a fine line between what is right and wrong. If someone does something as an act of retaliation  how do we tell whether that act is justified in the name of self defence or it went overboard?A former US VP who visited Palestine after the partition plan in 1947 said ‚ÄúI saw evidence on the village level that the Jew and the Arab get along very well  provided hatred and discord are not incited from the outside.‚ÄùPerhaps the reason why polls show that even more Palestinians support the October 7 events right now compared to at the start of the war  is because Hamas managed to frame the war as a struggle against imperialists instead of an idealistic one  and by doing so they managed to capture the hearts and minds of civilians. So instead of the mounting civilian death toll decreasing support for the war  Hamas used it as a rallying call against Israel and to strengthen their resolve in fighting against them. Palestinians could‚Äôve just bought into that narrative  even if Hamas does not necessarily have their best interests at heart.Sometimes it‚Äôs the state that‚Äôs the problem  not the hoi polloi.But also I don‚Äôt know a lot about this topic  and my views may be flawed. I‚Äôm just putting it the way I see it.,btohqsg
No I mean my PW is alr done and dusted  there‚Äôs no point now,btohqsg
I'm generally of the opinion that all opinions are good so long as you can justify it (which you did)Even if I disagree it doesn't mean ur opinion is wrong (unless ur back it up badly then uh idk lol),btohqsg
Fundamentally tbf this is just cuz I taught gp for like a year + and this is technically what gp is supposed to teach,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said you should see a doctor. It‚Äôs been going on for so long  you likely need to go for further tests and get a diagnosis. Avoid delaying the visit for too long,btohqsg
You can just walk into a polyclinic and say you want to see a doctor for a chronic condition at registration,btohqsg
