Because SIA announced bad newsAnnounce good news will dropAnnounce bad news will rise,btohqsg

When MT first release stellar results  plunge down then chiong all the way up. Wah that one good memory  sadly its the past üòÇ,btohqsg
Up 5 pip only then go down back to red,btohqsg
Why nobody mention that before release of results already ran up so much,btohqsg

If BBs want to play  they flush first make people panic  rest a few days then restart engine,btohqsg
