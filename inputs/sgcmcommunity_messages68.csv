Last updated on 1 sept and can plus 1 owner? ü§£ damn fast.,btohqsg
Why the price and depre don‚Äôt match in the ad,btohqsg
Michelin ps4 consider premium Tyre ?,btohqsg
Could be the seller changed the price after we post - J,btohqsg
Of course premium la compare to tourandor,btohqsg
Even they were surprised by their own results. Judging by the title of their own post.,btohqsg
"Keywords here are ""among 5 Chinese brands""",btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Jus trust the asians,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminLike I said  there are advertisers whose ads are dubious,btohqsg
There is a brand of tire called Triangle,btohqsg

question! how do you fix shallow scratch?,btohqsg
go to a detailing shop/good car wash and can buff out usually,btohqsg
can try using one of those tv ad pens,btohqsg
@xunxunxunxunyou got any other diy tips,btohqsg
i got anxious and nervous while parking,btohqsg
let me see if i got anything similar,btohqsg
no need  just take photo of ur car,btohqsg
it's a small line and the nail scratch din catch the pain,btohqsg
Lol what did you bua against?,btohqsg
suntec city car park lot barrier,btohqsg
Go to professional la.>$80 ? You WhatsApp them the scratch and he will quote you.Autobay OKShttps://g.co/kgs/niwVti,btohqsg
Time to change he tires soon. Wanted to change 2 only. What the cheapest and best out there,btohqsg
But bad in the wet.  Hydroplaning,btohqsg
Window haven fix and now got scratch,btohqsg
and why beemer drivers always dun give way one ah?,btohqsg
Just go and fix the window lor..300 plus minus,btohqsg
the window is under dealer's responsibility,btohqsg
so waiting for them to give me an update,btohqsg
The rolls Royce Even move when it‚Äôs red light,btohqsg
They are not not keen lah,btohqsg
i harassed the gal almost everyday,btohqsg
the workshop already ordered the part,btohqsg
I think your harassment not enough,btohqsg
These pple are not embarrassed one,btohqsg
but the sales still wants to get more quotes,btohqsg
so i wait till next wed and see how,btohqsg
2nd hand car salesman and Reno Contractors are the worse to deal with,btohqsg
i fixed an appt with STA to run an inspection with them,btohqsg
If engine parts‚Ä¶ u have to wait next year Liao,btohqsg
ahh...when the car was at the workshop  i actually asked the mech to have a good look at the car while fixing the window,btohqsg
i gave a pitiful look and told them i dunno anything,btohqsg
battery health  brake pads  engine oil....,btohqsg
STA inspection will not point out things like this,btohqsg
STA refers more to road worthiness,btohqsg
my kid told me i get to see strange driving everyday...and true leh,btohqsg
ya.... i want to know if there is anything major,btohqsg
That one must do before purchase,btohqsg
But I would suggest if you want to do an inspection,btohqsg
Might as well do at a specialist or proper workshop that will check everything,btohqsg
Now a bit late also to get wear and tear parts fixed,btohqsg
The windows also they do is good,btohqsg
And you pointed out before purchase,btohqsg
Engine-gearbox health  suspension components  interior switches  etc. And common issues with your car,btohqsg
hiyo! i screened from head to toe nails,btohqsg
You screen but first time buyer not used to looking for issues,btohqsg
side mirror rim got scratch and the sales can tell me wear n tear -_-,btohqsg
Mechanic sure no where to look,btohqsg
i can only see what's visible,btohqsg
Ok bah small scratches all a bit part of nego,btohqsg
Can ask them to touch up,btohqsg
Visible also got a lot of things can see one,btohqsg
i spoke to the mech already. once the parts are here  they will touch up for me,btohqsg
But workshop can hoist up car and they got experience to look for common issues with various cars,btohqsg
got check..the  kiddo got teach me wat to look at and where,btohqsg
Most wear and tear is part of your negotiation skills only  need to try and get them to do what you want or ask for a discount and do yourself because dealer jobs not always top quality one,btohqsg
If the negotiations not favourable to you and there's many other units in the market,btohqsg
Aiyo‚Ä¶ pple ‚Äú help‚Äù u‚Ä¶ u say he kiddo,btohqsg
Thought you meant your own kid all along,btohqsg
But you learn now after buying car,btohqsg
Next time all this must check before purchase,btohqsg
i dun even know why she's so upset of me getting a car,btohqsg
And remember to keep 5 to 10% of car price ready for such issues,btohqsg
No matter how clean the unit is,btohqsg
Wear and tear will always happen and you don't know which point of the maintenance cycle the previous owner sold their car,btohqsg
learning so much things over here,btohqsg
No worries! Don't stress too much about small scratches,btohqsg
Part and parcel of first car ownership,btohqsg
Scratch or paint transfer? You can try rubbing compound and see if it can be removed  else like the guys said  touch up with paint (p.s. and pls stay away from white Hondas) ü§£ü§£ just kidding la,btohqsg
Do send in a picture of the scratch later,btohqsg
Will be easier to judge the severity,btohqsg
Expensive cars and PHVs usually dun too,btohqsg
Go seek opinion from other workshop ba..your agent's workshop usually would recommend the most expensive items on their menu,btohqsg
I think it's more on drivers not the kind of car they are driving,btohqsg
Some drivers no matter what car got huge ego issues,btohqsg
Some in jap cars don't want to give way to contis,btohqsg
Some contis don't want to give way to erratic japs,btohqsg
All comes down to driver ego,btohqsg
The dealer paying for the window job,btohqsg
Not too bad  should be able to buff out,btohqsg
Cannot use those pen things I think,btohqsg
if drive vintage LL must give wayüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall har..dun give way  wait till I indent M113 on the road then y‚Äôall know,btohqsg
Find if there's a chat group for your car model in Singapore too  you'll learn more about your car and it's ailments lol and workshops recommendations,btohqsg
Specific issues  recommended shops to go to  etc.,btohqsg
Before they fix  must white paper black ink confirm all expenses paid  dun trust by word of mouth,btohqsg
Touch up some black ink  then remind yourself not to see too close upüòÇ,btohqsg
That's what I'm doing with my white ride üòÇ,btohqsg
Ask them send paid invoice for parts and labour,btohqsg
Lol i sit in that during my ns!,btohqsg
Infantry tank lol those used in WWII,btohqsg
You armour or combat engineer unit,btohqsg
Lol poisons that are suitable for avante,btohqsg
No la‚Ä¶that one can‚Äôt even crank up now,btohqsg
"Giti loFrom $73 15"" A rating for Rain üåßÔ∏è",btohqsg
Combat signaller for arti but ord lo! ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
Oops yeah got my watch and pok zhui kak üòÇ,btohqsg
You book Pre Purchase Inspection.More thorough check on wear and tear parts.STA only check road worthiness.,btohqsg
I almost picked giti but end up with kumho,btohqsg
Before that I din do enuff homework. To be honest  the sales were quite pushy and sort of like ‚Äújus buy‚Äù attitude‚Äù,btohqsg
Can still do now.Show them what's are the parts need to replace lo.,btohqsg
Amongst a few actually...cos it's a local brand rite? Iirc,btohqsg
Overall still alright except for that damn window,btohqsg
And the tires are all brand new,btohqsg
I know how to see the tyre health. So it‚Äôs not becos they polished or wat,btohqsg
Really new. Still got rubber smell (I love the smell),btohqsg
Very good already.My is Dual Clutch Problem. Pluck into OBD no fault code. No red light.So no repair. Cannot lemon üçã Law. No fault code üòÖIf I repair myself  $3 500üòÖ  so drive until blink light. Then overhaul on my own cost üòÖI just drive untill blink light,btohqsg
Tbh‚Ä¶I jus got my licence one month back,btohqsg
So my driving is like shit,btohqsg
is that why y look for new car,btohqsg
Old cars coe cars advisable to get?,btohqsg
new as in u just got it,btohqsg
nvm next time u buy car u will know better,btohqsg
And still have a clearer picture,btohqsg
Depends on what you're looking for and if you're ready for unexpected maintenance bills at times,btohqsg
Other than that  many cars out there that are great even after more than 10 years on the roads,btohqsg
That's the only way you'll get better!,btohqsg
Make sure to not hog lane 1,btohqsg
buyers part to play also la,btohqsg
i like cars that that are on their 3rd coe,btohqsg
at the end of the day the salesmen can be pushy but if the buyer knows his stuff and is firm  nothing they can do,btohqsg
if the buyer damn blur that‚Äôs their problem,btohqsg
Oh. This one I know the rule well. I will travel 100plus,btohqsg
Can take many months based on how much you drive,btohqsg
And the types of routes you take,btohqsg
Every new route is a learning experience,btohqsg
Cyclist and pmd food delivery on the road also must be careful of them,btohqsg
When I just passed  i got into a minor accident every year for the first few years lol and forced myself to drive again right after the last accident cos if I dun  I'll lose it forever,btohqsg
Yah Siam them or give them a wide berth as much as you can... delivery guys not having it easy. pmd riders looking for stairs to heaven  dun give it to them,btohqsg
1.5 metres min. by law now,btohqsg
Some motorbikes very entitled nowadays too so must be aware,btohqsg
Basically the killers are the food delivery and the errant yps pmd riders.,btohqsg
Look at phone or the other way  cross over stop like completely at t junction at speed then honk at you when it's your right of way and you honk to warn them,btohqsg
Oh increased Liao ah üòÇ when I learn I think was 1m lol in the 90s,btohqsg
Yupp increased over the past year,btohqsg
Because of recent accidents involving bicycles and lorries and cars,btohqsg
I signal right and siam to the right,btohqsg
There was once a panda rider cut from lane 1 all the way to lane 3‚Ä¶.scary,btohqsg
And then yesterday a group of cyclists did the same also,btohqsg
Eh! I thot they can only ride in a single file???,btohqsg
You think they care about u?,btohqsg
Yes and they never pay road tax,btohqsg
Many drivers and other road users don't follow road rules,btohqsg
So it's all about adjusting yourself to the situation and being safe,btohqsg
Can. If you get from Hew Motor. See his tiktok video.,btohqsg
Anyway it‚Äôs their biz lah‚Ä¶ they like to take such risk‚Ä¶ riding on the roads,btohqsg
Meet one ego driver   will send him to meet his ancestors,btohqsg
They can ride 2 by 2 and take up the whole left lane by law if it is a 2 lane road.,btohqsg
Which i think is fair  for the safety of all road users.,btohqsg
depends on which car you are getting,btohqsg
Never pay tax and want to use the roads ah?? Better apologise Lah,btohqsg
At least I cause accident I dun say sorry Is because I dun want to have insurance problems,btohqsg
Sorry ah but just cause we as drivers pay road tax and cyclists don't  doesn't mean we should be super entitled,btohqsg
Yes u r right.. it‚Äôs they should feel grateful,btohqsg
Everyone entitled to use the roads  public property,btohqsg
Just share and be safe and nice to all road users :),btohqsg
Dun really like the ‚Äúprofessional ‚Äú cyclists,btohqsg
Yeah. Looking at options. By end of the year should be getting one,btohqsg
End of the year ah?  ‚Ä¶.next time next time then say lh,btohqsg
"pls as much as i disagree w what some cyclist do  road tax doesnt give u more ""right"" to use the road",btohqsg
Road Tax is highly dependent on ur emissions...,btohqsg
Only emission i see from a cyclist is methane,btohqsg
If they polite   we should share the road,btohqsg
so u rather they cycle on the pavement and knock down young and even more reckless small kids and oblivious adults?,btohqsg
Let's be real  take out all the cyclists and two wheelers also,btohqsg
Still have 4 wheelers with drivers who are not polite,btohqsg
If they do it  at least it‚Äôs between them and the pedestrians,btohqsg
Some people dont even look where they are going when they are walking  even more dangerous,btohqsg
Human tendency for people to have ego and different personality,btohqsg
Like you also feel more entitled to be using the road compared to cyclists,btohqsg
They feel they have the right to use also,btohqsg
On the road  you will be the most safe. You have the upper hand  lets all be abit more courteous and forgiving. You dont want to get into the mess where a cyclist get knocks down.,btohqsg
so what is the best solution?,btohqsg
Govt to build PCNs and those cyclist tracks,btohqsg
And calmer drivers with no sense of entitlement and riders too,btohqsg
the pcn 25kmh  plus singaporeans cant even keep left on escalators.,btohqsg
They cant even observe basic etiquette,btohqsg
how do you expect the PCN to work efficiently,btohqsg
If have PCN and cyclist dun use  fine them,btohqsg
have u cycled on a pcn before?,btohqsg
pcn also will have dickheads one,btohqsg
have u seen stupid kids running in the middle?,btohqsg
okay so if i would like to cycle at 25kmh or higher leh,btohqsg
Knock into the kids ? And u get beaten up by their parents lor‚Ä¶ better than being on the road and being sent to meet their maker plus cause trouble to the car,btohqsg
Do what u want‚Ä¶. 100km/h also can,btohqsg
its more of problem mitigation rather than damage limitation.,btohqsg
If u win gold medal for the country then u can do many things,btohqsg
Why dont road users all be more courteous and no accidents happen on the road because we are all responsible road users,btohqsg
i in no way cycle on the road or anything  but i find the arguements against cyclist very unfair sometimes,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite hard cos cars are dater than bicycles,btohqsg
And the bikes want to be very action,btohqsg
And dun want give face to the cars,btohqsg
Always want to challenge the cars,btohqsg
can u let the adults talk,btohqsg
for once just stay out of it,btohqsg
The cars sure give the Hwee Teck to them mah,btohqsg
I am not saying cyclist arent wrong ah  or they arent annoying  but i am sure we can always Á§ºËÆ© to prevent major accidents,btohqsg
two hands to clap both parties can make life better,btohqsg
Why dun they pay tax and lobby for Govt to build a buffer lane for them,btohqsg
i completely agree w u some cyclist are really stupid  and some are just plain annoying but we should also drive defensively lor,btohqsg
so who do you want to tax?,btohqsg
Even though they never now  but the Govt still very good toCoy I,btohqsg
cyclist lane is a public good sir,btohqsg
Like dedicated lanes on the NS expressway,btohqsg
there will be a free rider problem  no one will be willing to pay,btohqsg
Dun bring the Air leve economics terms here lei,btohqsg
I believe  a new system has been implemented today leh,btohqsg
they close one lane along seletar airport for cyclist,btohqsg
yep  dont you think its a great start,btohqsg
Bro cannot suggest something then forget about practicality of it,btohqsg
Guys I think I figure out on how to get an easy fix for new noises on your car,btohqsg
haha i understand lor but i see alot of singaporeans like to say ram this cyclist down and everyth  they are still a life la hor. Be the bigger person and we our lives will go on smoothly,btohqsg
Go and eat your own things lah,btohqsg
Yes my Google translate also cannot,btohqsg
This is how a proper comversation go on okay,btohqsg
Sorry i dont have a x6m  so got to work even on Sundays.,btohqsg
disagree  explain  understand each other and agree to disagree,btohqsg
Only night time got time to read the chat,btohqsg
Have right? The new expressway‚Ä¶Have bus lanes and bicycle lanes‚Ä¶road surcharge and underground‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Or agree to the other at times,btohqsg
but ppl like u might not understand la,btohqsg
Not sure on this one  maybe new plan. Will research and get back,btohqsg
But would be a good plan for sure,btohqsg
missing 2 halves of an underdeveloped brains,btohqsg

0.5 seconds behind alonso for 10 laps but cannot overtake... siann,btohqsg
Yes ‚Ä¶. One can feel gbis way but pls calm down and THINK before u do it‚Ä¶ the cyclist die Liao is ok‚Ä¶ but you will suffer for the rest of your life,btohqsg
You must collect as much as you can,btohqsg
That's why better to step off at times and be the bigger person,btohqsg
Any good lady car to recommend?,btohqsg
my eyes have unfortunately witness someone get killed on the opposite side of the road before... can still remember the scenes,btohqsg
All cars can be man car and lady car,btohqsg
I see ladies drive hiace  civic  estima  lambo,btohqsg
I don't know... My lady haven't drive since she got her license 15years ago,btohqsg
You focus on sending document can or not,btohqsg
ik some girl drive vellfire sia,btohqsg
Get her a brand new car,btohqsg
Maybe try renting out some cars first,btohqsg
Im on the other side of the fence,btohqsg
Get her to start off and get used to them,btohqsg
Then see what she would prefer,btohqsg
The private banker that got brain damage in Bukit Batok received around 16MioIn famages,btohqsg
small car  good turning radius  not too powerful so wont get a shock + if scratch  easy fix,btohqsg
Since we‚Äôre both mature adults unlike someone,btohqsg
Something small bah for her and 2 kids,btohqsg
The less safety features the better. Im referring to thise lane keep assists bsm etc etc,btohqsg
Both also can  all upto preference,btohqsg
So if u are the driver  u can forget about driving anymore,btohqsg
only assist they need is ABS and city safety braking,btohqsg
Can consider some nice hatches; swift  fit  polo  golf,btohqsg
I ask you so many times,btohqsg
F KING PETE  BACK IT AGAIN AHHAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
Merc has lane change assist. Signal and car will decide when its safe for you  and chaneg the lane for you. I think somewhat like tesla's,btohqsg
Explain to us why swift is lj,btohqsg
sell in maybe 9 months haha,btohqsg
You say this then run away mah,btohqsg
new one or quite long alr,btohqsg
haha i waiting for 1 year  keep the insurance ukkkk,btohqsg
Its like to the point that lane change also need assist. Then isnt it the driver getting more and more not proficient,btohqsg
9 months later you need more space ah,btohqsg
might buy new one before sell swift ah,btohqsg
I think in a way quite cool leh,btohqsg
self park quite long alr right,btohqsg
Cool features but no thank you,btohqsg
yeah dude i think 2010 have alr,btohqsg
Its cool but thats why drives standard getting worse,btohqsg
The max I want is adaptive cruise control for highway drives,btohqsg
Okay lah 10 years ago idk about cars,btohqsg
Anything above that don't want already,btohqsg

This car thing is very complicated,btohqsg

But not entirely RWD tho. Sometimes can still see his car got a bit of AWD action-R,btohqsg
Got understeer  AWD good for launch but for track rwd cam be better,btohqsg

Wait so awd or rwd better for drifting,btohqsg
How come making hollandaise easier than this,btohqsg
AWD drifting implies you got bigger issues to worry about than your drift technique,btohqsg

Opel launches the Mokka-e here in SingaporeIt comes with a 130bhp output and a 363km range  perfect for those looking to go electric in a compact crossover!üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you think the Opel Mokka-e makes a pretty good electric compact crossover!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
but only 360 .range . for ppl always do highway need keep waste time charge,btohqsg
Yes. They generally all do. You can even tow a tesla and recharge the battery,btohqsg
So the limited range is actually not an issue unless one keeps the foot on the accelerator all the time?,btohqsg
is to maintain alow speed like 110km an hour,btohqsg
if u chiong like 200 and above it will flat fast just like a gas car,btohqsg
and not to use the brake  just use regeneration braking will do,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thanks guys üëçüëç,btohqsg
Download this app abrp if u going Malaysia,btohqsg
It will help u plan the route with charging,btohqsg
U just have to use current position then key inside place u want to go,btohqsg
Actually it'll Regen more when you step off,btohqsg
There are many chargers available on the way now from shell  Porsche destination charging and other providers,btohqsg
Speed might not be the best,btohqsg
But decent network as not many cars using them,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt release the acceleration pedal no regeneration,btohqsg
For highway users  better to buy Tesla with higher range or a taycan,btohqsg
Electric hatchbacks and crossovers more for city use,btohqsg
actually u will never need to use the brake   if you are driving casually  unless the car infront jam the brake  or some 1 cut you,btohqsg
Can adjust the level of Regen as well on the screen or with paddles in some cars,btohqsg

Yupp  step on step off traffic is where Regen will help,btohqsg
they pull the handbrake to slow down,btohqsg
But you don't need to use,btohqsg

Unless you want to use for emergency braking,btohqsg
But can set the level of it up,btohqsg
