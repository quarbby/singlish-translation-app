Rotational play. Today Pennies 1st day bounce recovery,btohqsg
Hope not a 1 day thing,btohqsg
Tomorrow should be a better day . Pennies looking to close well.,btohqsg
feels like v2y keep pressing hard to make us throw back or wait til contra due. $0.022 seems pivot for this round. DYODD,btohqsg
Today added some $0.022 V2Y. Accidentally sold some $0.022 too. I think there should be final throw down no rush.,btohqsg
even old penny leader parkson up 8 pips today.  and we are reachiing closing.,btohqsg
thought💭🤔 pAp is a package📦  why only parKsonRetailers run while pOllux & Acesian still koon💤😴.. 😪,btohqsg
V2Y trend still intact. $0.022 does looks like have other hidden buyers too.Feels like they want to rid more retailers out first. Just my view.There should be significant move coming within few days based on the chart . I reckon the probability to break up will be higher IMO.If so  good to scalp along the wave up.. Hopefully overall sentiments don’t turn down so soon. Our penny market today looks like an overall first day bounce.Anyways DYODD/OSOD  react accordingly,btohqsg
Net Pacific Finance did well on a big T4 day and closed day high where T was almost 14 mil volume transacted where it gapped and ran to $0.027 before retracing . It went to flush after and gap covered. Can almost feel that there is an ongoing collection  IMODYODD.,btohqsg

Prime is trading at PB x0.3 and hence the manager said its distressed. Think shorter term should be PB x 0.4  I.e. 24c.Out of the 3  Prime takes the most care of unit holders...1 for 10 bonus share in Mar 24 plus a DPU. The other two...Nil.,btohqsg
I am looking at the catch up potential - so looking keenly at the others.,btohqsg
"KORE is trading at PB x 0.37 as probably because of the brand ""Keppel"". Prime and MUD are lagging at about x 0.3.Prime has bought its gearing down to 46% while MUD's is still high at 56%. Prime will see improvement for 2H24 as one  asset is completing AEI.I see Prime ought to move faster as it is much more proactive in handling the operations and taking care of unit holders.",btohqsg
Any more factors to add since you're studying the potential?,btohqsg
Possible 50bp interest rate cut this month,btohqsg

Watching Daiwa House Logistic Trust closely for breaking out resistance band 61.5-62.5c. Bought this for high yield and stable DPU over the years  as well as positioning for higher Japan Asset Value as BOJ is likely to increase rate while US is cutting rate.
