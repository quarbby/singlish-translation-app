Assume same model same condition same specs everything,btohqsg
Only difference is  the newer cars seem to have lower depreciation than the older cars,btohqsg
So I'm wondering what the catch is,btohqsg
I'm seeing 2017 cars have lower depre than 2016,btohqsg
Might as well get the cheaper one,btohqsg
Cheaper as in lower depre and newer yes?,btohqsg
But ya  usually cars towards the end of coe  their depre is higher,btohqsg
I would have thought older cars are lower depre,btohqsg
But itâ€™s cheaper lor to get the 16k depre one,btohqsg
Yeah thought so. I think not so much cheaper or not  but more logical to pay lower depre for new car with lower mileage,btohqsg
If you can fork out to pay an extra year then so be it,btohqsg
OK la price not really an issue,btohqsg
depreciation is just indicating the useful life of the asset  how much value it drops. but cus SG car change hand a few times  hence it won't be linear. cus if its linear  no one making loss or profit alr.,btohqsg
Seller targeting buyers who planned to renew COE after 10 years,btohqsg
What about number of ownership transfer?,btohqsg
Number of ownership doesnâ€™t really matter THAT much for me,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ depends ah.. if a car keep changing owner so frequently within 2 to 3 yrs i also worried :),btohqsg
The lower depre ones have fewer owners,btohqsg
I guess the no. of ownership also gives you a peace of mind because we donâ€™t know how the previous owners treat and use the cars. The lesser owners  the higher chance it isnâ€™t really abused but also case by case  you can have 1 previous owner that abuse and miss all servicing schedules and youâ€™re still screwed hahaha,btohqsg
I just try to look for a combination of moderate mileage (around 13k a year)  lesser owners and low depre and go for a test drive. Ultimately you need to feel for yourself if the car feels good for its age,btohqsg
Coz too simple for him. He bored by it again,btohqsg
I always wonder whats his purpose of laughing at us who pump in SG,btohqsg
Want to pump just cross to pump lor. Nobody also laugh at him who waste time cross here cross there just to pump cheaper petrol. Itâ€™s not as if SG cars canâ€™t cross border now,btohqsg
Honestly i owned many cars. And i can tell you that owner count is more of a placebo effect. I have had 7 owner car in way better condition then a 1 or 2 owner car.Most importantly the owner before you must have taken care of the car   done the correct servicing & preventative maintenance.Having a good PPI also help find out the issues as well as finding any accident damage that wasnt repaired well/properly.At the end of the day. If a super model is infront of you. Does it matter how many exs she had? ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Which kind of reminds me of this,btohqsg
Hahaha totally agree. But unfortunately I think alot of the cars on the 2ndhand market don't have a proper servicing record and most of us dont even know what to look out for. We just drive  got problem look for mechanic hahaha,btohqsg
i rather have 7 enthusiast owners own the car before me,btohqsg
then two drivers who thrash the car everyday,btohqsg
Honestly have a good trustworthy workshop.,btohqsg
Dont get those shady kind one,btohqsg
Ppi done correctly will tell the next owner alot,btohqsg
we need more members like you.,btohqsg
Interesting. But really rightâ€¦ What has this lady got to do with a kitchen sceneâ€¦ plus I shudder to think what my mother would do to me if I wear wear shoes into the kitchen,btohqsg
oh hello there.  I've not seen that 'animal thing' in a while!!,btohqsg
Must see if they got leave servicing records. My prev owner did  then a year of servicing went missing then Ik alrðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hahaha so tough to trace back  hard to find one where the owner kept everything from the first servicing until sold,btohqsg
Just keep in glove compartment lo,btohqsg
Keep a file sir. More better,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ it is in a file,btohqsg
The file is inside my glove compartment,btohqsg
How big is your glove compartment?! Wow richpeoplethings. Mine is Pinocchio size ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«,btohqsg
Don't think it's applicable for Peugeot,btohqsg
Normal sized? How small is urs,btohqsg
Sounds like there is normal .. and there is normal ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi  is it possible to ask from agent for the car invoice sales agreement after 5 years,btohqsg
Oooo! Me like! Like catching PokÃ©mon,btohqsg
Why ah? What do I need to do when I see it? Put my sock on it?,btohqsg
First few years of the car price tends to drop more  especially at the 3rd and 5th year mark,btohqsg
Covid has changed this a bit,btohqsg
Oh weâ€™re doing languages  sorry Iâ€™m slow.,btohqsg
