Honestly Idm getting a old C or E class and just running it until it dies,btohqsg
I‚Äôm js scared it will actually kill me,btohqsg
if u get a W124 or W201 it will never die,btohqsg
Tbh the R33 was a negative brain cell thing,btohqsg
I could‚Äôve saved so much money on another car,btohqsg
It just wasn‚Äôt worth how long I used it for,btohqsg
Plus I think any other drift car wldve surfed,btohqsg
The R33 was me being a clout chaser and wanting a popular car,btohqsg
And that was an idiot desicion,btohqsg
remind me not to talk to car guys anym,btohqsg
It has its good and bads but I didn‚Äôt push it enough to feel the diff,btohqsg
It‚Äôs heavy but u can feel the power,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs a very good beginner car cos u can actually feel the weight shift,btohqsg
But after awhile the high torque and power takes a toll on ur tires,btohqsg
And the real cost is the tires,btohqsg
$100 per set ah so ok,btohqsg
thought you would use the falkens,btohqsg
Most garages don‚Äôt have falkens lying arnd for cheap oso,btohqsg
And they only order if there‚Äôs a demand,btohqsg
was it MCM that did it,btohqsg
But like the more ‚Äúlocal‚Äù tires are just cheap asf,btohqsg
On a Kei car or smth,btohqsg
I have a Mark 2 waiting,btohqsg
But dk if I wanna go thru w it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs either commit now and if smithing fucks up I just die,btohqsg
Or actually wait until I‚Äôm financially sure that I can handle the whole build even if shit gals,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs no ‚Äúgood‚Äù car for good price out there anymore it‚Äôs always gna be a trade off somewhere,btohqsg
There never really was but it was just less obvious cos cars used to cost a lot less,btohqsg
i think waiting out the covid prices i s good ah,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs the demand of it,btohqsg
Like there‚Äôs only so many more S14s out there,btohqsg
but RWD  drift car? CROWN COMFORT üî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
And like the AE86 has been hyped up so much,btohqsg
i heard its cause they import in,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not saying the AE86 is a bad car but it‚Äôs just not ‚Äúall that‚Äù,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs really just a Corolla with a fictional story,btohqsg
The only thing good about it is the 50-50 ratio thing but honestly it also doesn‚Äôt make the price right,btohqsg
like is it 200k USD worthy?,btohqsg
The R34 was just hyped up by FnF also,btohqsg
"i get that it's a ""supercar killer"" but still",btohqsg
I guess if u really like the car but it‚Äôs really not all that,btohqsg
pls dun hype FD2R up thank,btohqsg
im okay w them  but max 50k imo,btohqsg
All the JDM car kids think a stock R34 can do shit,btohqsg
Like a 2015 cayenne s can outrun a GTR34,btohqsg
Yeah i mean no hate to GTR fans ah ofc but I personally dun understand,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs cool n all but it‚Äôs not for me igs,btohqsg
Can a GTR fit 7 people,btohqsg
The important thing is that it can reach,btohqsg
Idk my taste in cars is described as rats ass,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a big fan of supercars,btohqsg
dont be a STANCE STATICNATION type can alr,btohqsg
Except that one merc the AMG smth,btohqsg
Bro I‚Äôll take that over any supercar u give me,btohqsg
How tf am I supposed to go grocery shopping,btohqsg
Like that is an actual concern,btohqsg
The Gemera is an engineering masterpiece,btohqsg
Bro offer me an SF90 vs a Vellfire,btohqsg
I would take thre vellfire any day,btohqsg
Like explain how I‚Äôm supposed to live with an SF90,btohqsg
Like damn I can‚Äôt fit shit,btohqsg
i was suppose to get a sf90 the other day but i saw that it didnt have much space so i just stick with my mom's swift üôÑ,btohqsg
ignoing his uh 20 cars or smt,btohqsg
N I have to constantly worry abt some idiot touching my car,btohqsg

Idw drive fast cars on the track,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt like straight up dislike supercars but I just don‚Äôt like them,btohqsg
Like u like pagani? Good for u,btohqsg
There is something unsettling about driving really fast towards a really tight corner,btohqsg
No bro I don‚Äôt trust my own driving,btohqsg
I would panic and shift from 5 into 4,btohqsg
I wld sim but I wld never go to track w an actual sports car,btohqsg
im planning to do that likely in oct sia,btohqsg
Even if u give me a gemera I would go like max and 100km/h,btohqsg
I mean like you drive grip for a long time alr so I think u can judge how the breaking point will be all day,btohqsg
No if I die it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
I‚Äôll probably be somewhat disabled and have a debt of a supercars,btohqsg
I was planning on using controller,btohqsg
Ur right later it disconnect halfway,btohqsg
Idk I never really push cars before irl so idk how to handle on a track,btohqsg
It comes w experience but I got no money for dat oso,btohqsg
Like sim u can just reset,btohqsg
I can track my car I just dw to die üíÄ,btohqsg

They have made their gearbox a lot better over the years,btohqsg
Went from an AMT for abarths,btohqsg
But the single clutch is great,btohqsg
For the kind of car it is,btohqsg
i recall seeing some with factory stripped interiors,btohqsg
And they had different manuals as well,btohqsg
They came with an option to have a dog legged gearbox,btohqsg
mental that they offered one from factory,btohqsg
actually quite punchy for the 1.4 TJ,btohqsg
that is a hotter hatchback than a Golf R imo,btohqsg
shit ton of torque steer + ultra lightweight,btohqsg
Used in a lot of other brands,btohqsg
yes that engine was utter garbage,btohqsg
Jeep still uses it in the renegade and compass,btohqsg
Quite a few brands using worldwide,btohqsg
adding lipstick to a pig only does so much,btohqsg
It was more the gearbox than the engine,btohqsg
i still do not trust fiat,btohqsg
