"thinking about an alternate timeline where Creative is a major player in the console business:some ideas for what their entries were:3rd generation: CubicCreative entered the gaming market in 1984 with an MSX-compatible console/""learning computer"" called the Cubic. It was a success in Southeast Asia and a niche success in  Australia and Taiwan but never saw release elsewhere except for a rare production run for America based on the MSX2+ standard as a test market release that now fetches high prices on the collector market. In 1986  a mid-cycle upgrade based on the MSX2 called the Cubic 99 came out. Many games for the Cubic were ports of British ZX Spectrum games.Notable games:- Metal Gear (separate localisation of the game  considered the best localisation)- Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (the last game ever released for the system)- The Legend of the Condor Heroes4th generation: Cubic 16In 1990  the Cubic 16 was released  and Creative entered the North American and European market. This system had a niche as a host for smaller developers who couldn't afford the high licensing fees of Nintendo or Sega  especially in Europe and Southeast Asia. This kept it moderately successful  though definitely a distant third place to Nintendo and Sega outside Southeast Asia.Notable games:- The Return of the Condor Heroes- The Legendary Swordsman5th generation: 3DO/Creative HyperCubic/Panasonic REALFor the 5th generation  Creative bought out The 3DO Company in the hopes of getting a bigger foothold in the American market  changing its direction from being an open standard to a single console produced by Panasonic for NTSC regions and Creative for PAL regions. It was a bigger success than in OTL as a result outside of Japan and South Korea  where its high price made it a commercial failure. It sold for 199 USD right out the gate  making it cheaper  albeit less powerful  than its competitors. For this generation  there notably were no wuxia RPGs due both to technical limitations and a bit of received wisdom that overly ""cheena"" games did not sell well in the West.Notable games:The Need for SpeedMetal Gear 3PolicenautsGexVR Man6th generation: 3DO M2/HyperCubic M2Shortly before the start of this generation  Panasonic and Creative ended their 15-year partnership  with Panasonic selling their entire console division to Creative. The console was released in 1999 to some success  though barely so outside of Southeast Asia.Notable games:Mr MidnightPower CrystalEscape from LATop GunIMSA RacingThe Heaven Sword and Dragon SaberAny other ideas?",btohqsg
I know there is but the line is blurry hence the discretion I mentioned. factors like what constitute a pursuit and what kind of crimes allows a pursuit are both at the discretion of the officers chasing.If a officer decides that the car he wants does not see him despite lights or sirens and let him exist to the nearest offramp to the nearest gas station..there is no pursuit. But other officers may see that the moment the car leaves for the off ramp and not stop. They call that a pursuit.So It varies from sit to sit  the blanket statement I'm basically stating is that the moment a driver knows they are being actively chased Danger will inevitably increase for all parties involved. This generalisation I make is literally factual by pure road statistics,btohqsg
Does not take a rocket scientist to know that a driver is unlikely to check every decision behind the wheel he makes against the backdrop of safety...because now every decision they make is on the backdrop of escape. Hence why danger increases,btohqsg
Pleasure? No. But I say cause why not,btohqsg
We have gone full circle a forwarded message of a forwarded message,btohqsg
Forwarded messageFrom YTI do not wish to engage in this conversation,btohqsg
Whatever man y'all do you  not my place to influenced y'all. I just say what I know to be as factual as possible. Y'all misinterpret it also whatever,btohqsg
Can we bring back bedok? He would provide an excellent response to dis,btohqsg
Tf he going to do  I literally taunted him to mute me like 6000 times,btohqsg
