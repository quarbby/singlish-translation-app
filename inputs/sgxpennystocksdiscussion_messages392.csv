If only I buy medtecs at 0.1 la,btohqsg
i believe pick stocks must pick the name satki kind haha,btohqsg
If I can share my view.Both MT and UG both carry equal weight at this point of time. If welling to invest 100K  you will get more UG lots.As for movement  both nearly same.Dyodd.,btohqsg
So now go on WSB see what's those underrated ones first,btohqsg
see SY company logo so satki,btohqsg
Shen yao is meme stock liao,btohqsg
I am in UG. But not MT,btohqsg
I don't like UG because they only do this one product. Not diversified. At least for MT if no one buy their gowns  may have ppl buy their mask or hospital services or whatever,btohqsg
I buy STA also. Even more diversified,btohqsg
MT seems more... Well rounded? Idk if that's the right word to use,btohqsg
Hope MT can run like STA la,btohqsg
I rmb this grp very sian STA stagnant,btohqsg
Soon bah. The results coming soon,btohqsg
And the listing of STGT in SGX,btohqsg
UG result should be next week,btohqsg
I think glove will really move,btohqsg

No glove production also can move one,btohqsg
Heng only I self high JT,btohqsg
But will you enter at this price point tho? Just curious. Nice cup and handle but not very hopeful movement follows through in such market also,btohqsg
They got philippine contract but announced only in Chinese media I think. With such info asymmetry  how to make SGX stock price move...,btohqsg
Only after reading Q&A on SGX net and SJ then found out...,btohqsg
I think we can don‚Äôt dream of med counters going back to their ATH. If got profits better to secure some along the way.,btohqsg
I still holding until FY21 end,btohqsg
Then after that shld have enough results from the med counters to see if their supernormal profits are relatively sustainable or not,btohqsg
At most just hold and wait for Disease X lor,btohqsg
I enter last week.  I view her 2021 scenario as no different from 2020. I willing to hold for a good profit.,btohqsg
Kejsi Musajhas been banned! Reason:CAS ban.,btohqsg

Visitors  caregivers or accompanying persons who have been admitted to or visited TTSH wards from 18 Apr 2021 will not be allowed into these hospitals:-Alexandra Hospital-Changi General Hospital (CGH)-Ng Teng Fong General Hospital-Jurong Community Hospital-National University Hospital (NUH)-KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH)-Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH)-Singapore General Hospital (SGH)-Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital-St Andrew's Community Hospital-Yishun Community Hospital,btohqsg
Where can they go if need medical attention,btohqsg
Wah look serious‚Ä¶I think the idea is to prevent more hospital lockdown,btohqsg
Can eat something else other than cai pmg,btohqsg
Visit ttsh cannot visit these hospitalsVisit IndiaVip to NCID,btohqsg
Texas don't have alot of branches,btohqsg
Wow.. That's almost all ?? Left what.. sengkang hospital ah,btohqsg
Only been to rws and changi city point,btohqsg
Confirm a lot of auntie uncle complain,btohqsg
Got error meh sounds about right to me,btohqsg
We do not turn away anyone who seek medical treatmentWe turn away ttsh peopleSo if these people seek medical treatmentWhich of the above statement is true,btohqsg
The visitors and caregivers cannot be sickSgh will reject them?,btohqsg
Goodness. What sort of clarification is that.,btohqsg
Mean patient can only go aloneü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Like confirmation of what everyone is sayingAdd some denialWeak,btohqsg
They play with words until they confuse themselves. This only make sense if they classify those from TTSH not as human.,btohqsg
A visitor  caregiver  accompanying person seeking treatment then? Lmao,btohqsg
Haha‚Ä¶. Like that nobody can enter SGH at all‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Still haven‚Äôt the part that‚Äôs incorrect,btohqsg
Then blood vessel kena blockage !,btohqsg
Well if the individual seeking treatment happen to be a visitor  caregivers or accompanying persons from TTSH at appointed date  can he enter or not?,btohqsg
They should go back school learn about sets,btohqsg
Think it‚Äôs more of language skill. The way they phrase it sound like all from TTSH will be rejected. But they actually mean only visitors  caregivers or accompanying person visiting SGH who happen to be in TTSH at appointed time will be rejected‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I think I am getting what they meant. Correct me if I am wrong.Although one has visited TTSH  SGH has no rights to deny him/her entry for treatment.However visitors / caregivers / accompanying persons who have been to TTSH  bringing the patient to seek treatment at SGH  are not allowed in. A nurse will bring the patient in for you.,btohqsg
Yeap.. but on first glance everyone will think they reject all from TTSH due to the way they phrase it. Think they should recruit new spokesperson.,btohqsg
They have every right to do soOnly sinkies no rights.,btohqsg
Thinking maybe it‚Äôs time to re enter Sheng shiong knowing the kiasee mentality of the public. DYODD‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Now can telework. Why need fly into SG. Okay fly into SG never mind. Why bring whole village,btohqsg
All these scholar generals cfm think their simi mathematical models bla bla bla show the risk-reward trade off as worth taking,btohqsg
The first thing I learnt in econometrics? Models do not reflect the real world. Especially if your model has many Random variables and uncertainties. That's why there's an error term in every regression eqn,btohqsg
With an unknown virus  your error term sure high what. When the variants all start appearing  no one ever bothered to question? All yes men?,btohqsg
They not paid to say I don't know mah,btohqsg
It's better to say 'I don't know' then to lead us into death,btohqsg
CCS also said what. His job as leader is to bring out answers in ppl,btohqsg
If he don't know  ask the citizens for answers la. Then we work tgt towards a soln. Otherwise have Our Singapore Conversation for what? Kaki gong kaki song? All participants are grassroots?,btohqsg
Their use of the term people..,btohqsg
Ya we are cash machine I forgot,btohqsg

CSJ alr trap Vivian w the 10m thing,btohqsg
Sure they will find a way to circumvent,btohqsg
But he trap in such an unfavourable way,btohqsg
When you trap someone  must give back road to escape,btohqsg
Or else they will turn and bite,btohqsg
So they turn back and hit ah,btohqsg
They shld get off their high horses for once,btohqsg
I tell you. Nus scholars all same pattern also,btohqsg
