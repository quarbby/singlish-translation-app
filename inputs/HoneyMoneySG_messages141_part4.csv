Hi all! I have been using citi rewards card.I just notice that citi premier miles card have lounge access  should i take citi premier miles card just for its lounge access?Advisable to cancel after one year?,btohqsg
If you only plan to use it for 1y for lounge access  maybe HSBC travel one is a better card?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve signed up for travelone. But to maximise the lounge access  is it wise to get citi premiermiles card since i have citi rewards card?,btohqsg
"No. Citi rewards and Citi premier miles don't pool pts so you can treat them as separate ""banks"".",btohqsg
What if i solely use citi premier miles for lounge access purposes? Is it advisable?Since i am existing citibank user and will keep using citi rewards card  i will not be able to get sign up bonus,btohqsg

You add Citi rewards  not amaze. Amaze just helps to convert transactions to online and reduce foreign currency fee.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs so much better. Can just utilise this card for loungeOnce again  thank you for your help üôèüèª,btohqsg
