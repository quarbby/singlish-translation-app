Hi guys another question I have a purchase that is ~$3600. I have the citi rewards card with amaze but I understand that the 4mpd is capped at first $1000.Can I just check whatâ€™s the best way to maximise this $3600 spend?,btohqsg
are you using the SingPass automated application?(1) can try using the manual submission of documents(2) or apply as secured card (means you put a fixed deposit amount with them amounting to your spending limit),btohqsg
I will try to do manually,btohqsg
(1) check with the vendor whether you can split the purchasefor example  if youâ€™re buying fromAmazon.sgfirst 1K can be done withAmazon.sggiftcards. Subsequent 2.6K use a general spending card.(2) check if the purchase is eligible for bonus 10X under OCBC TR(3) use a general spending card. Citi Premiermiles  UOB PRVI  etc.(4) apply a new credit card and use this $3.6K to hit the spending requirement for welcome bonus,btohqsg
