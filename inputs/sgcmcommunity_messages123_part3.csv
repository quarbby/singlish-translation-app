from C63 - C43 = C20!,btohqsg
Didn’t have the privilege for V6 or Inline 6  but their V8 sounded like American muscle,btohqsg
The best sounding Benz 4 banger got to be the 2.3L. Only one in Singapore.,btohqsg
I can guarantee there is someone out there with this badge on their car because it matches their plate,btohqsg
