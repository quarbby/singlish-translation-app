Hi there. I am living with my grandparents  aged between 80-85. And I have some challenges in communicating with my grandfather. He would very often insists in us bringing him to the bank to check his finances and to draw or deposit money. He would shout or get aggressive if we don’t abide to his requests or when things are either not at the actual place or the things are missing.What should I do?,btohqsg
Hi@ZztxchzZis your grandfather diagnosed with dementia?,btohqsg
I am not sure. But he’s a stroke patient. But he’s better now. Moreover he’s quite alert and good in remembering numbers. But there are times where he’ll keep asking the same question like every 30 mins or an hour,btohqsg
@ZztxchzZi would suggest you bring your father to go for dementia assessment. He is showing some sign of dementia… thereafter  you will be able to make better decision how to deal with the issues you mentioned in the first message.You can bring your father to do the assessment from any of the institution listed here:https://www.aic.sg/body-mind/get-dementia-diagnosis,btohqsg
Hi just wanted also to share with the member of public who mentioned abt her grand dad and his behaviour . As her grand dad is also a stroke patient   just wanted to share that my husband  a stroke survivor ( he’s 69) also has some of the behavioural aspects mentioned . However  he will forget the things that he mentioned and cool down after a while. Would also agreed with the advice given earlier to have him assessed to ensure that it is not dementia 😊,btohqsg
👍🏻 if it’s not dementia  then you can consider approaching Stroke Support Station  Singapore National Stroke Association and other stroke support group,btohqsg
Hello  I live with my grandparent too and while she doesn't display aggressive behaviour  she does get quite upset when things are not in the right place and when we don't follow her requests. She will mumble and go on and onIt can be quite frustrating especially if you're in the middle of something and can't attend to them.What I've learned is that sometimes behaviours are ways of communication. May want to observe what are the antecedents or triggers before the observed behaviour and see if you can see a pattern and react better  might even understand why numbers are so important to him. It also helps when I practise empathy and when he reacts  always let him cool down so long he doesnt hurt himself or others.Services  diagnosis are also great options to consider.,btohqsg
Thank you 🙏🏼geejay222 JaneReally means a lot to get some advise and hear some similar experiences to able to learn through this journey and also hopefully I’ll get a better understanding in the near future. Thank you once again!!,btohqsg

Hi good evening I would like to seek guidance and Advice.I have a closed friend who is having great challenges caring for a elderly mum. The problem comes usually at night where the mum keep waking up 5-7 times in the morning wee hours  there is 2 maids to care for the elderly. Elderly is communicative on wheelchair  and require assistance.The frequent daily wake up in the morning disrupts the maids and the primary caregiver night rest.Numerous means have been done seeing doctor  prescribing with sleeping pills  doesn’t work.I seek your advice on how such can be better manage in order not to add mental pressure to the care giver and 2 maids. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
I try not to let her sleep so much during the day.,btohqsg
Tried this. Spoken to doctor   prescribed with sleeping pills but no improvement . Care giver and maids have to wake up several times through the night,btohqsg
Oh ... But since got 2 maid .one morning shift one night shift?,btohqsg
Specifically  What time of the Day does she wake up? E.g. 5-7 Am. Based on the sleeping timing  it is possible to deduce a certain part of associated system. At the same time  insomnia is becoming more frequents due to the weather changes. Given the fact that she is wheelchair  that also imply that she may not have sufficent exercise. A possible recommendation to explore is to use acupressure/massage tenderly and softly on certain point to soothe the body-mind.,btohqsg

P.S as someone that went through insomina  sleeping pills dont work. The label is just a marketing terms. So it might be better to understand what is the root of the problem? If the elderly is communicative then one should practise active listening in their language to facillate healthy communication. Elderly sleeping less is normal in their old age above 70s.,btohqsg
For more information  do read up on this to provide insight on their lifestage development.,btohqsg
You may approach wish to approach Tzu Chi to see if they are able to assist if there is communication or generational difference. Just drop them an email. They are a well-respected charitable agency,btohqsg
So during the day and afternoon how is she engaged ?,btohqsg
Elederly wake up odd timing from 1-5am often to switch positioning when sleeping / up to go toilet.1 maid maid to assist elderly to toilet at night can be challenging due to the body weight of elderly.,btohqsg
Elder does no major activities . Sometimes when sitting also can doze off,btohqsg
Hi my hubby  a stroke survivor has quite similar problems as he is often up during the nights and does not usually sleep right through the night . We have two caregivers who will each take two nights to attend to him and this help to enable the one who takes charge of my husband a good night sleep while the other who looks after hubby at night will do housekeeping chores .,btohqsg
Each time she wake up got go urine ar?,btohqsg
Hi Jane  for the caregivers do they both rotate and take turns? Eg 1 rest 1 up to care or both will get up to attend to?,btohqsg
Not really. More of like need help of changing different sleeping position in short intervals,btohqsg
One caregiver will take charge of my hubby for two nights but she will not do caregiving duties due to looking after hubby at night. She does housekeeping and assist the other caregiver in transfer of hubby to wheelchair / bed/ commode. After two days  the role will be reversed to the other caregiver doing the night duty,btohqsg
Alright I try this method thank u,btohqsg
Let me know if you require more help😊,btohqsg
Would like to take this opportunity to wish all fathers Happy Father’s Day♥️🌺,btohqsg

Hi everyone! We are a group of students currently studying Digital Communications & Integrated Media (DCIM) at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). As part of our Student Innovation Programme (SIP) module  we are looking to find deeper insights into caregivers that are currently providing for the elderly and hopefully create a prototype that best fulfils their needs. We would greatly appreciate it if you could give us 5 to 10 minutes of your time to fill up a simple survey!https://forms.gle/NGiBNFPXBdC9r71i9,btohqsg
Thank u and will be happy to participate 😊,btohqsg
thank you so much Jane! 😊,btohqsg
I have a query with the Google form as it did not allow me to submit based on one of the questions. How do I get it fixed with the organiser as I am not able to submit the form .,btohqsg
Hello Jane! Can I check which question in particular is it?,btohqsg
Hi All! My team and I have created this padlet platform  a virtual caregiver space:https://padlet.com/mfcglab/wknxrdaxrzhn4nioYou may feel free to share your experience or ask any caregiving related questions.,btohqsg
Hi The question in the survey” Which aspect of the help …”,btohqsg
Hi Jane! For that question you have to select only one option within a single row  so each aspect is given only one rating (either 1/2/3/4),btohqsg
it will look something like this! hope this clarifies,btohqsg
Actually  there are many online spaces including Option B group on facebook. Market analysis wise  the question is what is the differentiation value and value proposition from A to B. So  one must develop a niche or complementary needs,btohqsg
P.S linkedin. If one uses well  provide access to international experts and contacts.,btohqsg
