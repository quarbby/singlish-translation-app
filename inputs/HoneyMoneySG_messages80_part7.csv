Hi all! Can i ask if citibank rewards card do not cover in-app mobile wallet transactions  are there any way I can work around with? Is it through using amaze card?,btohqsg

I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Giro hsbc pay credit card” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Different airlines different miles required. You can google. Should be easy to find. For SIA  Google “Kris chart”.,btohqsg
"Anyone know if the Eagle Eye Centre at Parkway East hospital is considered ""Hospital""?Heymax says it's MCC 8042 (Optometrists and Ophthalmologists)?",btohqsg
Did heymax suggest to you which credit cards to use?,btohqsg
In app transactions made via Apple/Google Pay do not give 10X points  but you can use amaze on Google Pay to get the 10X points. If you're using iPhone and the app doesn't support paying by card directly then good luck to you,btohqsg
Does someone here has Excel or formula how to calculate ADB ?,btohqsg
Need some help on the ADB as I didn't manage to get the OCBC bonus for last month,btohqsg
Do you know why you did not get? Which one you did not get? Salary   spend or save bonus?,btohqsg
OCBC save bonus criteria saying must have 500 ADB more than last month  I just check mine is showing 2 digit ADB now. Wondering how to increase to 500 to get the Dec save bonus,btohqsg
My small tips for you and everybody on ocbc 360 ：1). Transfer in $600 on 1st of every month.2). When salary and monthly interest are credited into the account  transfer it out by 6pm on same day. So ADB will remain as $600 increase throughout whole month.Just these 3 types of transactions every month on your account. You shallavoidusing this account for other transactions  so not to disturb your planned MAB.Most important step:Login to ocbc 360 account via web on every week n last week of the month to check the tracker to see have you fulfil the criteria (salary  spend and average daily balance vs last month).Remember to spend at least $500 on OCBC eligible card monthly to meet 4.65% criteria  Or else 4.05%.,btohqsg

How about salary credit? Need to be giro?,btohqsg
Assuming your current month ADB vs last month is only $40 more as of 19 Dec and also you don’t have any other credit/debit transactions between now and 31 Dec.To increase it to hit min $500 ($500-$40) x 31 / 12 = $1188.34Need to deposit $1188.34 before 9pm today(20 Dec).｛it is zero safety buffer}But usually I will use min $600 to have more safety buffer or in case any miscalculation. With this  I will prefer to deposit $1446.67 today.,btohqsg
