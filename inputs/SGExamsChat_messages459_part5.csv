I’m quite curious on how their learning system and ungraded internship works,btohqsg
it was my initial plan ah  chem,btohqsg
From what I can gather  you use rp to try and secure s future job through internship,btohqsg
The best route as a rp student is to try and secure a job through intern,btohqsg
Secure a job offer through the ungraded internship,btohqsg
That is gonna be the best route you possibly can go via rp,btohqsg
Yea  cause that is more likely than not gonna be your peak,btohqsg
Because I see their track team,btohqsg
Rp is not very well recognised poly in the corporate world,btohqsg
Having so much time to commit to training,btohqsg
Yea  the issue is cause our exams are open book,btohqsg
Or at least most of the students I see,btohqsg
Y1 is open bookY2 is one piece of paper,btohqsg
But again it's harder to score,btohqsg
So the best prospect for RP is securing a job through the ungraded internship,btohqsg
Since the % of people going to local uni is single digit,btohqsg
Could possibly because their threshold is like 26,btohqsg
Or do Ur own external intern xd,btohqsg

I quit gaming a long long time ago,btohqsg
Nowadays when ppl talk abt gaming   it ‘s all abt the refresh rates on the screen,btohqsg
