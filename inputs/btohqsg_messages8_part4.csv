Yea. I register yesterday at HDB already. Bto & SBF,btohqsg
This plot is vacant now  not sure is it for BTO  anyway good seaview of 1.8km away,btohqsg
The Tampines BTO in Aug... not seaview but bedok reservoir view  close enough? üòÇ,btohqsg

Yea i saw it . Not interest,btohqsg
Cheap resale at this old block  1.5km away to Seaview  can see from the bedroom and kitchen,btohqsg
How far away the sea from your house?,btohqsg

Such determination. Kena poisoned by your friend gaogao  haha..Ask your friend to sell you as resale when it MOPs,btohqsg
Aww very near like just waterfront I & waterfront II,btohqsg
Does the calculation of monthly gross income for EHG include bonuses? Not to confuse w HLE,btohqsg
From HDB:The EHG amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over for the months worked during the assessment period  i.e. a 12-month period prior^ to the date of your flat application,btohqsg
so it is like base salary + any bonuses ?,btohqsg
From MOM:Gross monthly income from work refers to income earned from employment. For employees  it refers to the gross monthly wages or salaries before deduction of employee CPF contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages  overtime pay  commissions  tips  other allowances and one-twelfth of annual bonuses.,btohqsg
Okay I remove my own words  so both statement copy paste from .gov.sg =),btohqsg
Hmmm  really MUST seafront  MUST east side  MUST affordable  MUST ready to move in  seems like only option is P. Ubin.,btohqsg
Changi Village also got some rare HDB.,btohqsg
But if MUST NEW or relatively NEW oso  then bo liao.,btohqsg
talking about this  I think it‚Äôs a wasted opportunity for the upcoming Cross Island Line not to pass through Changi Village. could be complications underground in that area but oh well,btohqsg
its really really rustic  i love the area,btohqsg
I'm also eastie.... but if forced i dont mind living anywhere in SG   woodlands  Tengah  Yishun all ok for me,btohqsg
It's easy to get anywhere in SG afterall  besides if WFH becomes default most of the time living anywhere is the same in sg.,btohqsg

Can anyone who waiting for Tengah share the expected TOP? Is it gonna be 2026 or 2027 ish?,btohqsg
If I'm targeting 2024 for SBF TOP around then  do I look at the2018/2019projects? Or even earlier/later?,btohqsg
HDB resale prices rise 5.9% in first half of 2021  with new high expected in second half of yearContinued delays to BTO projects and demand for resale flats in attractive locations are behind the increase  say analysts.üè†https://tdy.sg/3jx54MQ@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
