Confessing Mental Health Struggles With FamilyWith more conversations about mental health being encouraged today  many youth find it easier to open up about their struggles. Despite that  confessing mental health struggles to your family  in particular your parents  still remains a great difficulty. After all  how do you tell someone who has seen you grow up your whole life that you’re not okay?We spoke to five Singaporeans who shared with us their journey of confessing their mental health struggles with their family and what their parents did to help.https://zula.sg/confessing-mental-health-struggles/?fbclid=IwAR1Nu_bpC_kswlmv3ZICzfPh9SxbMG33-a_6ufA7WnabtuthvP23PO0Cukw,btohqsg

Hi I have a friend with this situation now. If you can help in any ways  please do reach out to me please. Thanks!======================================My mom recently was diagnosed with a Haemorrhagic Stroke which resulted in partial paralysis of her body and now requires a permanent tracheostomy breathing tube to assist her in breathing.Could I ask for advice or any recommendations for items / 2nd hand items required for homecare like :-medical bed-pressure relief mattress-suction equipments-geriatic chair,btohqsg
We are in a similar situation. Read our Quora for what we have done:https://caregivinginsingapore.quora.com/?ch=17&oid=3054126&share=396067ef&srid=pi7H2&target_type=tribe,btohqsg
Best to ask the occupational therapist attached to your mum’s case for advice before buying anything. If you don’t mind second hand items  always go look for cheaper options on carousell first. Then try shopee. Last option actual retailer.,btohqsg

LET’S START A CROWD-SOURCED RESOURCE COMPILATION! :>Background:At the beginning of 2022  our mum suffered a post operative complication (a brain stem stroke) which left her incapacitated among several other neurological deficits. Since then  my sister (Brenda) and myself have been scouring the internet for resources/subsidies/cheaper consumables/etc - anything that would be helpful for our situation as we don’t qualify for any subsidies. We only found this FB group a few weeks ago  and we were really encouraged by the active sharing and replies from everyone in this group.Objective:We want to start a crowd-sourced googlesheet compilation to share all the resources that we have found so that it would benefit anyone who is going through a similar journey as ours.Current status:The first thing I started was to compile all the freebies/lobangs that would be useful for us. The next thing I did was to compile all of the govt schemes/subsidies that I am aware of! I intend to continue adding a lot more info  such as consumables  transport  medical help etc  and I will update whenever I have completed my consolidation on this shared googlesheet!How to contribute:I have made the link public so basically anyone can view and comment  as well as download it to customise for your personal use! I am still wondering if I should make it public so that everyone can just go add stuff to it but I am afraid that info might get accidentally deleted so I kept the editing rights for my sister and myself! I fully intend to maintain and keep this googlesheet updated as our situation is likely to be chronic and lifelong anyway. However  we would love to have contributions/suggestions on how we can improve this  and also if we have missed out anything  please feel free to either comment on google sheets directly  email me atcarolboeyql@gmail.comor reply to this post! Thank you! :>HERE IS THE SHARED GOOGLESHEET AND I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL FIND IT HELPFUL:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J4LsUhhfkMOfOeDnm77ngc4fyt9Da9qaIIyEsUFyT7A/edit#gid=688707439,btohqsg
