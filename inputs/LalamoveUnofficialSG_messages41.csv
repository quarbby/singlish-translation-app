U can't cancel  anywayJob canceled confirm not your problem,btohqsg
"But the problem they put a note ""driver cancelled"". How can User happy happy cancel n make us take the blame",btohqsg

Don’t have but talked to 2 drivers there before every night once she end shift she will ask drivers to transfer the commission sometime driver delay not enough money she will blacklist the driver then can’t take anymore,btohqsg
Problem is I didn’t exchange contact with driver and can’t spot them at ikea anymore,btohqsg
What she is doing is highly illegal,btohqsg
Yes you’re right honest and truthful drivers can’t get jobs because of her,btohqsg
Feedback to Lalamove many many times already but no action taken...because their main concern is as long no complaints from customer and the job is done they don’t care.,btohqsg
Yeah we were next to each other and both of us are motorcycle account,btohqsg
Email and cc: to spf cpib email,btohqsg
Then send letter direct to cpib and spf and cc: llm,btohqsg
Best is if u have the Head of CPIB direct email direct to him and cc: to the rest,btohqsg
U will see hand leg move quite fast,btohqsg
U got to have concrete proof lah of course  otherwise it is purely conjecture,btohqsg
I go dinner liao super stack both done,btohqsg
Guys if it’s a credit order but it states tips $2 payable by customer  meaning do we still collect $2 cash from customer?,btohqsg
"no need. When u finished the delivery  there is an option on the lalamove customer web that will force the customer to click ""pay"" for the $2.",btohqsg

If tips shown in receipt (say payable by customer). Restaurant staff told me they will pay me once I drop the 2 orders.Is it correct?,btohqsg
Once u complete  don't swipe cash collected,btohqsg
By right when u cfm order n bill  they will pay the tips over St their end when they see order completed,btohqsg
Wah power sio car or bike?,btohqsg
So I don’t press cash collected ??,btohqsg
how do we get the missions arz,btohqsg
Anyone near concourse / golden mile wanna meet dinner?,btohqsg
Restaurants mostly will pay via credit. Once u complete the job they can see on their side then will pay tips. Leave the cash collected unswiped. When they credit the tips  u will see the cash collected disappear and the tip will be shown in ur wallet.,btohqsg
U can press cash collected if u collect the cash tips,btohqsg
I will always call the customer after I complete if there's tips to be collected  to remind them. Although llm say now don't need call liao,btohqsg

Dun read the notes   ask and confirm,btohqsg
sometimes very confusing cause they say already pay by credit,btohqsg
but they say need collect from customer the notes,btohqsg

there is nothing illegal about cancelling a LLM order or having preferred drivers. unfair maybe  but legal. as far as i can see only the kickback is illegal  but as long as there is no concrete proof (bank statements  etc)  there's no chargeable offence here.,btohqsg
Hope to see you break 4xx today bro👍,btohqsg

Aready peanuts. So cannot let them tax anymo😜,btohqsg
What's the min. Amount to leave inside the account?,btohqsg
you can leave $0 inside the account  but will be asked to top up $20 to take cash jobs. If you avoid cash jobs can leave it at $0. (but during peak hour spam everytime you hit a cash job you get the nag.),btohqsg
Anyone here used the Shell lalamove fleet card?Any idea if can use the card straight after receiving the pin? Or like need wait for bank to send giro confirmation then can use 😂😂,btohqsg

A woman in India called off her wedding after her groom failed to recite the multiplication table of two.🤔https://tdy.sg/3nZKTHp@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
Actually the woman gave her husband chanceNo education should oso know 2 times table,btohqsg
And the bride did not take umbrage....,btohqsg
Thanks Jace. But it's those $2 tips and priority fees confusing me. Which party suppose to pay?,btohqsg
It means yesterday I got one order the restaurant said already pay by credit  but bill indicated cash tips. $2 fly..haha,btohqsg
I think if u check ur wallet balance,btohqsg
Hi guys  can check if the drop off pt is restricted area  n price nvr include  do we contact Cs or tell the customer to include?,btohqsg
That's y even though llm say now don't need to call the customer after completing the job  I still call them everytime if there's tips involved. N i always check with them when I do the pickup. If they not sure  I will get them to cfm if its pay cash or credit b4 I pickup n go😂,btohqsg
Maybe not foolproof  but so far touch wood nvr kena non payment yet,btohqsg
Most impt don't swipe cash collected. Swipe liao inform cs they will say can't do anytg🙄,btohqsg
I kena b4  b4 take job it's listed as priority fee. Normally priority fee is instant credited. So I carry on do the job. Completed the job n cfm bill  showed up as tips to be collected. I blur,btohqsg
End up I nvr get the extra money,btohqsg
So now I always double check,btohqsg
Msg Cs after that they say cannot do anytg🙄,btohqsg
This i not sure  wouldn't rule out system problem considering it's llm😂,btohqsg
Making it that we have to settle any issues ourselves  then their back end just shake leg😕,btohqsg
the issue i encountered was when llm amending my order for waiting fee,btohqsg
Order with llm tips   after amending for waiting fee  they nv put back the tips they give,btohqsg
Ah yes. This 1 also must be careful,btohqsg
I accepted order   payout $21 bucks   after amending for waiting fees   payout still $21,btohqsg
3 different cs before it got sorted out,btohqsg
Lucky i screen shot the payout when i accepted,btohqsg
I kena b4  regarding the tips,btohqsg
Got 1 order  tips to be credited. Not cash. Customer use his llm coupons,btohqsg
Call him he double cfm he paid liao using e-wallet. Then I told the Cs. Then they say they will amend order. By right the tips is not to be deducted any commission. Ended up the amended order I get less  cos they included everything inside the main price.,btohqsg
From then on  I try to settle with customer instead of llm. Sometimes settle with llm  after everytg will kena charge a customer service renegotiation fee or something 🙄,btohqsg
Llm cs is cb like tt,btohqsg
Please ask for purchasing fees   I just learnt yesterday,btohqsg
If customer or Cs doesn't want to include special fees  is it grounds for us to cancel the order without any penalty,btohqsg
Anyone took order from waacow before??,btohqsg
Yea the one at marina one,btohqsg
Their payment is alright  no issues,btohqsg
Did you received tips from them.,btohqsg
So far they use priority fee  not tips,btohqsg
As for me yesterday trip cost $29 but a shortfall of $6,btohqsg
Have u asked for restricted area fee b4? Do we go thru Cs or call customer direct?,btohqsg
Ah ok. I dunno whether can call customer😂,btohqsg
Cos now go thru Cs must wait an eternity😂😂,btohqsg
Thinkg whether to take an advance order,btohqsg
Later if cannot get the restricted charge I will want to cancel😂,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the advice bro👍,btohqsg
Reason y I nvr take b4 such jobs,btohqsg
But I realise I see jobs with the restricted fees very little,btohqsg
N still can get the $15??😂,btohqsg
So I not sure whether it's restricted area  I Google n it seems to be😂,btohqsg
Somebody here said hospitals oso restricted zone lol,btohqsg
Now covid  if i kenna ttsh i will CS ask for secure zone too,btohqsg
I sent food to workers dorm before  that fella put his dorm address and unit number  i also asked for secure zone fee,btohqsg
I sent many times to cgh.. can't go in anyway.. the staff always come drop off lobby to collect,btohqsg
Sometimes I even left the package with security post  take pic n they collect themselves otot,btohqsg
Normally those that mentioned meet at lobby etc i dont whack  it is those that expect us to send door to door with unit number type,btohqsg
These days  bodaiji they dun allow enter,btohqsg
If end receiver is not llm user  after getting secure zone fee  i will liase with receiver how to drop off,btohqsg
Hardest to do one is Mount E at orchard... Zzz,btohqsg
End of the day  how u complete your job is your problem. Dealing with extra fees is theirs.,btohqsg

Hi guys  do you know how llm calculate the commission? I know is deduct 16%...but most orders sure got diff like 2-5 cents,btohqsg
The cut is not accurately  16%,btohqsg
I realised llm subsidy no deduct commission  some order in driver service tax deduct $0.20 or $0.30...dn based on what 😂,btohqsg
about $30-$40 a day  which is average. you can try tribecar  they rent out by hourly rate. if theres a pickup/dropoff near your house its a lot cheaper  just pay for working hours.,btohqsg
Motor?Rent out motor more ho tan than rent car,btohqsg
If the system show me pay ale by customer no matter priority fee or what  I die die collect from customer even cash or pay now  I will show them the screen   end up of they pay more is llm problem ady,btohqsg
