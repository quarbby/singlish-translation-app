🚀Pika World Inflation Outlook In Focus - January 12 2024🚀The journey towards softening inflation took a snag as the pace of price level gains achieved momentum in December compared to the prior month.This is a setback to traders who are pricing in aggressive rate cuts for 2024  starting in March. On a yearly basis  the CPI had jumped 3.4%  above the consensus estimate of 3.2%. On a monthly basis  the headline level rose 0.3%  which aligns with estimates.💸Sticky inflation remains a hurdle.💸The main culprit  which we have mentioned numerous times  without surprise  is the shelter cost. It rose by 0.5% in December and is responsible for more than half of the monthly increase in inflation. It has proven to be highly stubborn  although many economists are projecting that figure to cool down in the coming months  hopefully helping to reach the Fed's 2% target.💡Positive signs on the data.💡Still  there are some glimmers in the data. If we are to exclude the more volatile components  such as the food and energy component  we are seeing a general decline in price pressure. Core CPI had cooled off to 3.9% growth on a yearly basis  which is a further drop from December 4%. Core CPI rose 0.3%  which was steady in November.The CPI data points to nothing worrying for the Fed to step onto the pedal for a rate hike again while strengthening the probability of a soft landing.🥁What are some drivers of inflation?🥁Zooming into the fine details  motor vehicle insurance  used car and truck prices  and the gasoline index had climbed in December  which helped to keep inflation above expectation.🎲What are the cool points?🎲A welcome note is that food costs are increasing  and grocery costs remain steady. For example  the cost of food at home had only risen by 1.3% every year  and dining in restaurant costs had seen a slower growth of 0.3% in December compared to 0/4% in November.Household furnishings saw a decline of 0.4% in December  which is in line with the fall seen in other categories such as appliances and durable goods.📪What's on the menu today?🖨At 9.30 pm  we will receive another side of inflation data: the PPI data. It is also expected to climb; thus  it could prove challenging for the market to break new highs.On a positive note  at 11 pm  we have FOMC member Kashkari speaking. He is among the most dovish members of the Fed  and if he maintains that  some relief in the market could be a factor in.It is January 12  Friday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. It has been a wild trading ride  and we hope all friends have a safe trading day to wrap up the week.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
