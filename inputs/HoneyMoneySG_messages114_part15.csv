Either search or just learn to read the T&Cs.. it ain't rocket science,btohqsg
Can I still keep UOB lady card if I gotten their UOB solitaire card ?,btohqsg
I still having both for now & I change the category to 3 different one,btohqsg
they may or may not automatically cancel your old lady's card but both the cards share the same cap and categories so there's no actual benefit,btohqsg
i would take shorter since the interest rate now is very high and high interest rate will not last forever,btohqsg
Hi Gurus. Would like to seek and clarify regarding the Maybank Platinum Visa Card I understand that you need to spend consistently every quarter to get the tiered earnings. Could I check e.g. if I spent on 1 transaction for each month at $1000  does it still qualify? or is there a minimum number of transactions required?,btohqsg
2.65% p.a with salary + 500 spend.2.88% p.a. with bill payment + above.,btohqsg
As long it's not excluded. What are you spending on?,btohqsg
Probably people shifting from hsbc Revo,btohqsg
mortgage loan using cardup.What I meant is there a criteria whereby I have to spend e.g. minimum 5 transactions a month to qualify for the tiered cashback?,btohqsg
No. For me I only have 2 transactions per month. üëçüèªIf in the future you plan to use the card to pay insurance directly  it can only make up 50% of your monthly spend.,btohqsg
any cardup code for recurring payment for home loan ?,btohqsg
Anyone received invite for opening GXS account? Is it worth the effort?,btohqsg
Last heard they have closed invitations. Have they recently opened again?,btohqsg
You can check their website. They put all promo codes there.,btohqsg
Effort to create the pocket and deposit in ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Haha can just open first if receive invite   digital bank still mari giving more than gxs,btohqsg
Hi just checking can we still use Nestia or liquid pay app for Sgqr payment or we can only use Amex pay for now only ?,btohqsg
Hahaha until this month. But I think they might extend,btohqsg
As in is it worth moving funds there?Let's say I have a uob stash acc right now there is below the 2% mark,btohqsg
LiquidPay should be can  but basically same as PayNow.. so no point to use it,btohqsg
Maribank and GXS also better. No have any special criteria also.,btohqsg
Have you max out all your other savings account? Or is this cash for your emergency fund,btohqsg
Yes my uob One is maxed,btohqsg
Just excess funds I guess lol ü§£,btohqsg
You can just open the account first  no fall below fee anyways,btohqsg
Max as in 150k? Then how about Ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Yes and no ocbc acc. Recommend maxing ocbc also? Before moving excess to elsewhere?,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs criteria. If no fuss  then gxs or maribank loh,btohqsg
Yeaaa the criteria abit off putting since I'm already doing the uob One... Hence why I have some excess in UOB Stash,btohqsg
But just received the invite for GXS so wonder ü§î,btohqsg
Can also rotate between HSBC EGA or SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Even if you salary credit and save  it‚Äôs alrd 3.2% below 75k. Much better than digital banks,btohqsg
So totally no more points to earn  only left is Amex pay for now right ?,btohqsg
AMEX Pay  Grab Pay depending on what card you have,btohqsg
Ocbc is not bad. Can hit salary + save criteria for almost 4% pa.   Low effort. Then self transfer to hit requirements for uob one.,btohqsg
Wow sounds like its only online payment within white list merchant that gets 4mpd,btohqsg
I see theirs sales staff kept having booth in MRT pushing passer by to sign up,btohqsg
Mari better than gxs mehMari bo pay now I think only can use in shoppee app I recall,btohqsg
