apparently new s class damn easy to turn too,btohqsg
the 4 wheel steering is crazy,btohqsg
I think better then model y,btohqsg
Mode y is like 12 m,btohqsg
Still selling now  started orders for many already but delivery times are long  6 to 8 months unless you buy ready stock if any and some options are limited or if you tick  your delivery time increases by quite a bit,btohqsg
volvo is a nice car. at least i turn my head when i see one. stylish exterior,btohqsg
time for you to head down to volvo showroom try an S90,btohqsg
alot of car reviewers say volvo make the best seats on the market,btohqsg
He joining me as a tesla fan boy liao,btohqsg
Mr X very rich leh  buy tesla can buy more car one no need worry,btohqsg
I tell you best turning radius coming soon,btohqsg
It's damn good in fact.. I drove a few times. Only going up those multi storey carpark like Clark quay central a bit irritating. Sensors keep beeping even when I have plenty of space.,btohqsg
When u trade in for other brand cars  your wallet won't be as stylish liao.,btohqsg
haha yep agreed. I have sat in my friend's grandmother S-Class while she maneuver around tight carparks haha... not an issue at all,btohqsg
S90 is a stylish car. i turn my head when i see one,btohqsg
May the day be better for all of you tomorrow!,btohqsg
Only the head stick out at those hdb car park lots.,btohqsg
Sensors will always be sensors  just need to ignore sometimes and use them as a guideline and drive. When we learnt how to drive  no sensors at all. Now the new Nissan leaf epower and Hyundai Kona coming in as learner vehicle already  and they can't dekit the sensors or camera,btohqsg
but i just dont like this. this is the one that irks me the a/c controls,btohqsg
agreed haha just head down and see la,btohqsg
see see look look for fun when u r free lor  my favourite past time,btohqsg
Can freak u out when it beeps mah.. S500 not cheap ley..,btohqsg
checking out cars used to be my weekend past time. lengkee every weekend. i would park my car far away and go each and every showroom to check out. because if sales see my car they very wellk know i aint serious buyer,btohqsg
Own xc40 but driven XC90 S60 S90,btohqsg
Agreed  can be scary but just about getting used to the sound and remember what intensity level is the point for you to stop,btohqsg
XC90 was courtesy car  used to drive an S60 and S90 was a friends car,btohqsg
all volvo? you volvo die hard,btohqsg
there were 242 850 V70 XC70 in the family!,btohqsg
Mr Xun is a big Volvo fan!,btohqsg
XC70 was short live because my mum cldnt stand the looks of it😂😂,btohqsg
i rented one v70 wagon. terrible. i rented this thinking it's great but what a gas guzzler,btohqsg
Haha it is indeed exquisite taste,btohqsg
but i like the volvo deep \set instrument cluster. unique. saab also has similar style. just very swedish,btohqsg
exactly! i love the quirky scandinavian design!,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/Dq3oEQv5950someone says singapore has one. csar belongs to the dealer right? he usualy has the # plate 66,btohqsg
this is my desirable play car. a collector,btohqsg
Recently brought in by the dealer,btohqsg
There might be some on order,btohqsg
i think it is HIS cvar,btohqsg
all sold. how many allocated to singapore?,btohqsg
No idea  but I'm assuming there will definitely be a few units spread around that will get put into collectors' storage at wearnes,btohqsg
you will have to buy a special torque wrench if you want to opne the special wheels,btohqsg
alfa is brought in by euromobiles right?:,btohqsg
Similar to Lamborghini center locks and the Porsche magnesium wheels,btohqsg
what car do you drive mr. arnav,btohqsg
your name sounds italian mr. guliani,btohqsg
I pull rickshaw like Mr Anwo,btohqsg
Hahaha yess very similar  I've heard this a lot,btohqsg
i have an affinity to amny things italian. washing machines indesit  cars  bikes ducati for instance  shoes bags etc,btohqsg
Sad to disappoint you but I'm not Italian 🙃🙃,btohqsg
but you tried to be italian?,btohqsg
a friend of mine has 2,btohqsg
plagiarims is not what they are good at,btohqsg
so how  did you get class 2?,btohqsg
I personally really like the diavel and scrambler 1100,btohqsg
I would love a Panigale 899!,btohqsg
yeah i have. but expired and so i didnt bother,btohqsg
oh it expires? didnt know that,btohqsg
since i dont ride bikes anymore i dont bother to renew this,btohqsg
too bad wasnt able to get a bike license because parents dont allow :/,btohqsg
i have people to take care of and have responsibilities to uphold :),btohqsg
but bike riding is dangerous. i have a friend who absolutely must ride bike. he says best. he has mercedes benz prius kupcai but he loves riding bike and not cars,btohqsg
nowadays u see so many clueless drivers on the road  being on the losing end  u dare to risk it all for the fun of it?,btohqsg
my father got into bike accident. it's indeed dangerous. i got scared,btohqsg
just kidding  bikes are truly dangerous  we can always apreciate from afar :),btohqsg
so when is it your turn to own an italian supercar,btohqsg
no wonder you are in volvos,btohqsg
Many buy bikes to store as art pieces in their houses as well!,btohqsg
What do you think about the new 296 GTB?,btohqsg
that is what my friend did. special memories he says,btohqsg
i like volvos not cause its safe hor  its just good looking to me😂😂,btohqsg
i want to own an aprilia too  but lane splitting is a dangerous game nowadays,btohqsg
aftewr geely tookover  volvo did fantastic with their makeover of styles. good job,btohqsg
italian machines are special  has character and uniqueness,btohqsg
i remember i have indesit washing machine. lol,btohqsg
but their cars are not suited for our climate,btohqsg
or at least they dont thrive in our humid environment,btohqsg
many years ago when i was sent to germany for training and i met 2 italians students in class. they asked me what i drive and i say alfa romeo  immediately they say i have great taste and they see me differently. they are passionate people,btohqsg
people who drive italians have diserning taste. they do not care about resale or what others say,btohqsg
That sounds similar to Volvo fans,btohqsg
Mr Xun and you will get along very well!,btohqsg
that too. because they are uncommon,btohqsg
Yupp  and they do not care for resale value and what others might say  love Volvo for what it is,btohqsg
i agree haha slow like mr road hogger said boring like most journalist said and oh the markup on those swedish tanks  terrible,btohqsg
lets not forget the poor aftersale service and lousy resale,btohqsg
i take so many photos of giulias haha,btohqsg
HAHA they are amazing AMAZING cars,btohqsg
Veloce 280 hp 0-100 5.2 secondsSuper 200hp 0-100 in 6.4 seconds,btohqsg
when i buy a car i also never asked what my friend feel about the brand.,btohqsg
the amazing steering wheel and huge supercar like paddleshifters,btohqsg
but veloce doesnt fit my family needs if not i wld gotten it long ago haha,btohqsg
ok when i see tesla 3@bbfasingaporenext at traffic lights  we will floor to see who goes first,btohqsg
who doesnt love a good looking sedan with italian DNA,btohqsg
i need to fit 2 huge dogs :/,btohqsg
i would say it is much prefered over my m3. 2 door not practical,btohqsg
if they come up with a giulia wagon might consider but even then it might be too short,btohqsg
My dogs cant fit in the Volvo V60 thats why we got an XC40,btohqsg
Aiyo but nothing beats ur S65 with that screaming roar,btohqsg
What dogs do you have? 😍,btohqsg
a golden retriever and malamute! 2 big chonky and tall boys,btohqsg
aiyo admin time to sleep alr ba  you have worked hard today :),btohqsg
mazda 6 has wagon. styulish and van fit your two dogs well. give it a thought,btohqsg
you warned a few guys today using your power?,btohqsg
haha i would love to have it too! mazda is honestly one of my favourite brands too. But the Mazda 6 is not tall enough thats why CX8 was the consideration.,btohqsg
i am about to stir the already heated chamber,btohqsg
but CX8 vs XC40  i'd prefer to stick to my scandinavian blood😋😋,btohqsg
now is which EV can fit,btohqsg
I like CX8 haha rented one in japan,btohqsg
wow did admin lift me out of slow mode?,btohqsg
you guys been to germany motorshows like essen show?,btohqsg
lots of stuff to see for mods,btohqsg
You sleep?! Aren’t you a chatbot!?,btohqsg
of course frankfurt. biggest. but new cars only,btohqsg
i have been to geneva show too.,btohqsg
That one I’ve been to their watch shows,btohqsg
frasnkfurt show i cant even finish. too big,btohqsg
Sadly the era of motor shows is slowly going away,btohqsg
More and more car makers are spending the money that they would spend on motor show stands to rent studios and invite influencers and media outlets to make content on cars and host lavish media drives or lend cars to the same content creators,btohqsg
Where are you going on Monday afternoon?,btohqsg
i went to sleep. heat is unbearable,btohqsg
after watching heated debate here. i dont want to feel hot anymore,btohqsg
tesla is going to build cars using special machines that make casting. i wonder if others would follow,btohqsg
Spend same amount  make an anime and have 1000x the exposure on youtube,btohqsg
Exactly  and you can present the car in various use cases,btohqsg
Some are moving away from the set media drives to studio shoots for launches and then lending the cars to content creators to drive and be creative in their own spaces to avoid the monotonous nature of set routes and locations,btohqsg
As the world evolves  carmakers are evolving and embracing the importance of the internet and social media,btohqsg
i believe i can fly. nice looking car,btohqsg
And also what you think of the XC40 recharge,btohqsg
This one I not sure leh  I didn’t reserdch too much into the model codes,btohqsg
Actually not alot of issues la but u have to know both are on different platforms. XC40 runs on a CMA platform which is meant to be a compact car while XC60 runs on a larger SPA platform which makes the car abit more luxurious. Both dont have any issues that i know of except maybe the aircon cooling coil which may (30% chance) of spoil. Other than that its a volvo.,btohqsg
Normal things like sensor maybe if reaching 10 year period need to change but i would count all this as wear and tear ba,btohqsg
XC40 T4 R was 180k back in april 2021  i heard they selling the XC40 recharge for upwards of 250k now😂😂,btohqsg
It has to be because of Wearnes diverting all the EEAI and VES to subsidise the ICE cars.,btohqsg
Damn smart but also at the same time quite f up also.,btohqsg
thats whydont buy  let them realise that nobody wants to pay for it😂😂,btohqsg
That’s why that article by SGCM about D2C resonates very strongly with me personally,btohqsg
No dealers = no such BS,btohqsg
Aft I found that out I was like wth. If Wearnes can do this  so will other dealers.,btohqsg
their XC90 markup is very close to 100k  but at one point when they were trying to clear the previous gen S60  that was when i bought it because they lose abit of money on every car they sold,btohqsg
Like a sucker punch to them,btohqsg
But ya the data from OneMotoring that is refreshed every month also shows the difference between basic cost and actual alr.,btohqsg
exactly haha  now tht the XC40 recharge so expensive  used car prices for the ICE XC40 also went up🤭🤭,btohqsg
so good to be rich. can keep changing toy,btohqsg
Think he may be testing various type of suspensions!!!,btohqsg
You mean the ride quality right hahahahahaah,btohqsg
I think it is mutual benefit 🙈,btohqsg
But a lot of ppl love dealers services,btohqsg
They enjoy the “haggling” process maybe,btohqsg
But it can be repetitive and very tiring aft visiting many showrooms,btohqsg
Yes and enjoy the ad giving them discount,btohqsg
When it’s not actually a discount,btohqsg
The hard truths that nobody wants to say,btohqsg
They will tell you they fight with manufacturers,btohqsg
And give u the discount as u are vip,btohqsg
The margin is not for them 1,btohqsg
Walk in like a boss   pay like a boss,btohqsg
I don’t feel like a boss when I’m 90k poorer for example,btohqsg
wonder if you drive an econobox n dress shabby to an atas dealership .will one be treated differently🤔,btohqsg
some boss dun look like boss😂😂,btohqsg
Actually alot of boss don’t wear like a boss also ma haha,btohqsg
It is normal that you are judged at your first impression.,btohqsg
It happens even with my car. But I was wearing singlet + RSAF running shorts so...lolI saw they jaw drop when I hop into my car  at first they though I am jumping queue for takeaway haha,btohqsg
they jaw drop cos your car is older than you😂,btohqsg
but saw quite a lot youngsters these days driving vintage cars...,btohqsg
Ok I try like this walk to Rolex shop,btohqsg
Actually is really feel better when u pay more   so u can tell pplI pay like 300 k for a car,btohqsg
try wear a old t shirt . preferably with some holes. n a Jap slipper those white with blue kind... see who entertain you firsr😂,btohqsg
This is not neat liao hard to have respect,btohqsg
I did this before… to a condo showroom,btohqsg
if got any sales guy or gal still entertain you with respect...he or she deserve the comission,btohqsg

lai lai  share what’s your favourite ///M car!,btohqsg
i saw one in germany essen motor show. with roll cage used by polezei,btohqsg
yeah probably the e92 m3 or the e60 m5,btohqsg
The advancements in engine technology have been incredible  the g80 M3 with a 3.0 inline 6 also has 650nm of torque,btohqsg
germans lagging behind honda engine tech in the 90s 2000s,btohqsg
for sure but they have one of the best engines now,btohqsg
b58 inline 6 win worlds best engine twice alrand is the probably one of the most tunable engine in the world,btohqsg
We have no data on honda vtec turbo reliability because those cars still relatively new right,btohqsg
Maybe will kaboom or soemthing down the road nobody knows,btohqsg
but the bmw in me just dont agree with long inline 6 engine. i dont buy it. because the engine is pushed inward to passenger cell to balance the car. and servicing working on it becomes harde,btohqsg
ehhh hondas generally quite reliable ah even the type Rs,btohqsg
so bmw resists making V engines.,btohqsg
yes generaly reliable.  you can trust it,btohqsg

No need shame.just fine/summon/charge in court,btohqsg
CosThe shame is the one that causes the damage,btohqsg
it is not a big deal. if he see the news  it woud be a reminder for him not to do next time. that is if he feels ashamed.,btohqsg
Maybe he is working for someone else  and the boss sees it and he gets sacked… how the poster feels??,btohqsg
Post if u need  comment if u want. There is a legal system to deal with all these.,btohqsg
that;s good. he should not be acting this way in the first place,btohqsg
Might as well say if@Cxspeedmazada god got fined for vip parking along dbl yellow line  it doesnt hurt him cause he drives M3 and has 2 cars,btohqsg
that is not a wise comment and inappropriate. if i do such act like blocking ambulance car  then post it. i am okay. but i know i wont do such  thing,btohqsg
Yea if u are caught blocking and if there's a law and you get charged for it. So be it you paid your dues,btohqsg
if you see a driver using lane 8  that is inconsiderate right. post it  show # plate. i dont see anything wrong with such selfish behavior,btohqsg
There's no need for excessive shame,btohqsg
haha to me that is not excessive,btohqsg
then dont do it next time,btohqsg
let that be a reminder for punishment,btohqsg

My XC40 is made in china but it still has very good build quality,btohqsg
Mr Arnav  I spot a certain decal on your white car👀,btohqsg
Made in China has a bad conotation of poor build quality or quality control of a car. eg. Tesla. I have seen Teslas that are made in US and made in China and i dare say those made in China's Gigafactory have far superior quality control over those made in US. Panel gaps are much better etc,btohqsg

heavy up to a point  too heavy is counter productive. i'd say up to 1.6 ton,btohqsg
we can always try a head on between a Mazda 6 and S90 and see who is more well protected,btohqsg
This was the same 924 decades ago,btohqsg
U all don’t fight my car is heavier so heavy need use extra load tyre muhahhaahhahaah,btohqsg
