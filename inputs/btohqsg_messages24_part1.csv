Yea the chencharu hills physical 3d plan,btohqsg
Riley & I have said it. The 3D model for June 2024 BTO won't be out that soon.,btohqsg
Hi all  I'd like to ask for clarification on my question. sorry and big thanks in advance as I am new to this.We are first timer and have a BTO queue number for Dec 23  but it's outside of supply. we had applied for Feb 24 BTO  and I'm in the same situation of having a queue number but outside of supply. My partner and I are considering applying for Jun 24 BTO  but if we have a change of mind and decide to go for resale in the future  are we able to? Will there be any penalty? such as the grant for resale as first timer?,btohqsg
You will be able to forgo the ballots and go for resale. You will still get grants.,btohqsg
No. Queue 2 will have to wait for queue 1 before they can select,btohqsg
In the meantime queue 2 can process documents  but the act of HDB officer selecting the unit on their system will have to wait until queue 1 has selected their unit,btohqsg
That's why sometimes appts get delayed,btohqsg
Don't be late you will cost all behind you to delay,btohqsg
Think there is a cut off time  after that considered missed queue,btohqsg
Understand this is hypothetical but pls try to be early or on time to be considerate to HDB staff and those behind you,btohqsg
All miss their Q will be put to 4pm on the same dayAfter which are counted as forfeit,btohqsg
Where did you get this information from?,btohqsg
I asked the HDB officer when I was selecting my flat,btohqsg
Is that on the assumption that only one officer is handling all the flat selection on the same day for the one project though?Otherwise like hard to control whether queue 1 gets to select before queue 2,btohqsg
Can. It's a centralised selection system,btohqsg
So basically no one gets to jump the queue number.& it will be very fair. One number by one number rite?,btohqsg
UI looked v old sch ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yea  unless beyond some certain point  then considered missed queue number,btohqsg
Doesn't sound very efficient if queue 2 officer can't do anything because must wait for queue 1 to select firstðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Can  they can do everything else except the selection,btohqsg
So they can ask for your documents first,btohqsg
Unless queue 1 didn't authorize a third party to attend the appointment and change their appointment to a later date  then queue 2 will go first,btohqsg
Wa then hope for more of such cases & ppl who forfeit tooSo our number moves forward automatically ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But ask for documents also won't take that super longOr might not know how late queue 1 will beHa ha  officer and applicant stare at each other while waiting for queue 1,btohqsg
Last time when thereâ€™s no penalty. The forfeit rate was up to 40% per projectNow got penalty. Forfeit rate at most 5-10% ba I guess,btohqsg
Yah  dropout rate supposedly much lower now,btohqsg
Yeah correct. But not sure what the threshold is cause heard someone's selection delayed like 45 min. Which seems like a waste of time on both parties parts,btohqsg
Yah lor... Can be quite a waste of time  esp when it comes to flat selection because competing for the units,btohqsg
Thought this one not just singles only,btohqsg
Right..if pre covid I can afford 3br resale..now I can afford 2rm bto flat..insane,btohqsg
Actually i find that even if the single is well to do  2R resale are not really worth the price tagIf resale  can just go for 3R  regardless if renting out or not,btohqsg
I LOL at the upper price range of 2R Type 2 at Tanjong Rhu in the current launchCrazy  378k + 15k for singles on 99y leaseIf OCS  maybe another 2k?,btohqsg
Oh yah  i forgot this one is mature estateBut that price for 2R ðŸ˜±Think ~47 sqm? Not that it is bigger than other 2R BTO?,btohqsg
Tanjong Rhu prices are crazy  4 room 568k to 779k,btohqsg
Imagine the resale price 5 years later...,btohqsg
I think highly unlikely  thats what the government is trying to prevent from happening. But we should expect a much larger clawback % upon sale due to the higher expected subsidy to make  it affordable,btohqsg
If i rejected once in the past  if i reject again will i still be allowed to apply?,btohqsg
Oh by the way  i wanna ask -So  does Standard / Plus / Prime apply to only BTO?Should have nothing to do with resale  right?I mean  even Standard in a ulu place can be sold for high price after its 5y MOP,btohqsg
Plus and PLH restrictions will be applied to their resale counterparts as well.,btohqsg
PLH resale still maintains the 10y MOP. not too sure about PLUS,btohqsg
Can't rent out full flat  income cap  etc,btohqsg
You have yet to see SBF mature areas like Queenstown that's about the same price as this. 2 room type 2 is bigger.,btohqsg
But yeah the higher the floor the expensive it is ðŸ«¢,btohqsg
Housing loan can loan so much? What if my hfe states 400k only,btohqsg
Is it for prime area they will loan higher,btohqsg
Yeah I never understood this. Cos when I look at my own HFE letter it doesnâ€™t make sense haha,btohqsg
Like the household income is lower there compared to mine but theyâ€™re saying this household can afford a higher price at a mortgage rate much lower than what was given to me,btohqsg
But i think they increased grant amount right,btohqsg
Hi  I am currently applying for Hfe for next round If I have been working for 2 month and my partner worked for 12 months 1) would both of our salary be counted for grant? Or only the one hitting 12 months?2) would both of our salary be counted for loan?3) what if the hdb loan amount is too low and cannot cover the property price in prime area  can I find a bank loan on top of hdb loan? Or can I re-assess loan closer to key collection (in this case would they take back my grant)?Thank you for help!! :)),btohqsg
1. No grant  both must hit 12 months(Edit: people below have corrected that only 1 person needs to hit 12 months for EHG. Total household income needs to be $9K and below)2. Yes (they'll divide the salaries accordingly). Cut off 2 months before HFE application.3. Choose either HDB or bank loan. No reassessment.Income decrease  loan decrease.Income increase  loan remains unchanged.,btohqsg
