Service is available in hk only,btohqsg
Means not much job for van in SG?,btohqsg
You can request for cancel after 30min wait. But u wont be able to claim waiting fee,btohqsg
May oso mean logistic market is too small in sg,btohqsg
But i heard logistics market will be expanding in sgRental rates will increase by aprilSo watch out for it,btohqsg
Rentals rates for commercial vehicle going up bcos of the diesel tax maybe,btohqsg
When there is growth in the economy the Govt definitely wants a piece of the pie,btohqsg
Last month i went to abs leasing they say in April  NV200 got rebate $20k bcos it's using petrol. Only for those using diesel must pay extra $10k for the diesel tax.,btohqsg
B4 implementing that  they raise up the petrol price already. So clever,btohqsg
Jus like playing dai deeThey tend to lay out 2 spade first b4 the final card,btohqsg
Just wait till all erp gantry turn back on.. price will surely go up.,btohqsg

Problem is u can handle or not,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see a problem with that üòÇ I doing lalamove with my partner so I‚Äôm tempted by this suggestion,btohqsg
But how to register 2 acc to one car,btohqsg
Cannot  u need another veh no.,btohqsg
makes more sense if u get one car and one motor account... two car accounts parked at the same spot just going to see the same available jobs... its no different from just one account  since u only have the one car.,btohqsg
Where can ask abt whyq application? I applied and no sound no picture from them,btohqsg
You do more their orders from llm  and wait for their invitation.,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if Nissan NV200 isit counted as 1.7m Van?,btohqsg
Hi guys can any experienced driver share with me isit easy to earn $200 a day with car on lalamove?,btohqsg
Change new app become lesser job,btohqsg
Can but you‚Äôll be driving 10-12hours a day,btohqsg
On average for me per 5 jobs i take i earn abt $70+   i work from 1030 to 5pm including abt one hour rest for lunch,btohqsg
Average i aim > $15 per trip,btohqsg
I think if u take one week as a guide per day 150-200 for car is possible,btohqsg
Cuz i mainly do Meal hours n Weekend full day minus off 3 rest day i average out $162/day. And feb still have 3 more days to go haha,btohqsg
But i only started last year Oct so i am pretty new too. Mayb the more experienced user have tips to earn more üòÇ u never know,btohqsg
I have reduced my driving days only for Thurs to Sat 11 to 9pm. Weekdays prices and car orders are just too low to justify for the car cost. Other days I work with F&B or Home-biz for route deliveries. Less dramatic than LLM and save petrol. I dont do LLM MPV jobs anymore - too heavy and too much time needed.,btohqsg
True that. After deduct fuel don't really earn $200 unless super lucky,btohqsg
Mpv job mainly take wat item?,btohqsg
If driving car you need to be a grab driver to do grabexpress,btohqsg
A lot of saikang  basically van job but customer dowan pay for vanEg. Delivery between fastfood outlets - frozen chicken  stacks of cold pizza dough  need manpower and timePersonal deliveries could be bicycle or small furniture,btohqsg
I suppose 2.4 requires helper1.7 can solo,btohqsg
I do foodpanda then LLM during weekend lunch time.,btohqsg
Do u guys know where i can source for delivery helper or walker,btohqsg
If using car.. outside of llm will you all suggest to do panda or grab?,btohqsg
Haha I got grab drivers tell me if not full time  don‚Äôt commit grab cause grabfood run a lot on incentive.,btohqsg
I use 1.7 but orders come in super slow,btohqsg
Even if have very fast taken by others,btohqsg
I am doing panda because per job its higher.,btohqsg
I heard gogo last time have,btohqsg
But didnt know current lala have,btohqsg
And i oso guess llm will be reluctant to ban them,btohqsg
I sit under hot sun wait order,btohqsg
Wah. How much is it per job for panda? :O,btohqsg
But anytime cock up pick up order they cant do they also LL,btohqsg
Without mod whats ur daily income,btohqsg
I only do PT after school,btohqsg
Only do to cover van monthly installment and extra cash,btohqsg
Buy small van for transport and earn extra cash cause of the flexibility,btohqsg
Old app i can hit $100 daily easy,btohqsg
Nnow these nee app alot problem,btohqsg
Order lesser  even if have  others pick up faster,btohqsg
I have taken trays of Indian food which the curry stained my seats and my car still smells. 43 cartons of peaches  a TV console  an electric drum set  8 big boxes of clothes  all exceeded weight and dimensions. Suck thumb just do it cos not as painful as trying to get in-touch with CS. Others include Tai Cheong egg tarts (14 crates to their outlet)  frozen food  b2b deliveries in boxes.,btohqsg
Orders are consistent  in a fixed area  range between $5 to $10.5 ( depends non peak or peak hours ).I do 3 hours per hour to a maximum of 4 jobs an hour.Since i do in downtown  my petrol consumption is much lower.,btohqsg
Wahhhh is like abuse the system lol,btohqsg
Just like bikers kenna asked to bring trolley  or deliver jelly cakes or van jobs got to deliver furniture up stairs. I feedback in the LLM training to make it mandatory for user to state what needs to be delivered  so we have a choice to accept it or not. But they said too difficult.,btohqsg
Hey everyoneüòÄ anyone doing lalamove car also? I'm doing as PT before uni starts! I realised that ever since CNY the jobs like damn little  especially ystd and tdy,btohqsg
Sat Morning Grain Food project all popping out now can online take guys,btohqsg

Mine always lag  i did 4 jobs today but as of now reflect only 3,btohqsg
Pull till i drop my pants liao,btohqsg
Let me see your complete timing,btohqsg
Pick job after 8pm not counted,btohqsg
And now must complete within time frame also,btohqsg
Thats why jus now i miss 1 count  i swipe complete it was already 20:00,btohqsg
Hah nor becos of masters like him now must complete within time frameHe suck too much money from llm liao üòù,btohqsg
You damn È∏°Â©Ü everytime jus waiting for chance to suan ppl oni ü§£,btohqsg
Eh. After refresh - they counted that job for me yeeheehee,btohqsg
U just wan to catch attention ist,btohqsg
Test see whether u still alive not,btohqsg
This is the special project?? All from enterprise place,btohqsg
Bro u ss like that how we see haha,btohqsg
All the orders got tt comments,btohqsg
i dont see it  guess the parcels are too big for bikes.,btohqsg
Its not abt the amount la,btohqsg
The jobs just keep popping out,btohqsg
I itchy hand go take one,btohqsg
they book motor also. cut cost.,btohqsg
So many q to get order,btohqsg
For bike is $0.40/km now ?,btohqsg
In the first place didnt notice they changed bike price to this:,btohqsg
But if u calculate the jobs its even higher @$0.40/km,btohqsg
nice. maybe coz airasia coming in at 70c/km on tuesday 2march.,btohqsg
Eh but then... Their distance always like short of 2km lol,btohqsg
If u compare it against your own map,btohqsg
or maybe just need more bikers. its the cheapest option on the lalamove menu.,btohqsg
Last time was $10 under 3km  now become $10  under 1km  good news!,btohqsg
Ya no more short change 3kmIt was always $10 under 1km with the old app,btohqsg
Ok the jump-scrolling in the app or whatever u call it is seriously damn irritating,btohqsg
Ya laCant even see 1 job properly üôÑ,btohqsg
No job complainToo many job also complainü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
they really should have a filter vehicle option,btohqsg
Filter everything...vehicle  day  time  locationEvery other app has it except llm zzz,btohqsg
ya lo I got feedback to them before.. Guess they really scared bike order even lesser ppl take,btohqsg
Well ..... not having filter doesnt make ppl more likely to take bike order  if they dont intend toLol,btohqsg
ya lo... hopefully they start listening to their drivers loüòÇ,btohqsg
"They jus need to try the app themselves one time and they will immediately realise ""omg how can we design the app liddat""",btohqsg
i think they removed the filter coz nobody wanted the town/central jobs and filtered those out.,btohqsg
give the central jobs more exposure.,btohqsg
coz on my app about 8 out of 10 jobs are town based.,btohqsg
But even without filter u will still self-filter mahIf a person doesnt want town jobs its also likely he/she is not near town  not filtering the jobs wont make the driver want to take town jobs,btohqsg
but if town-job are the only jobs visible then no choice.,btohqsg
coz thats what my options are on some days.,btohqsg
Then they cannot half past 6 liddat la... Let ppl pick but want to tell u what to pick,btohqsg
theres a limit to the number of jobs displayed  so when the immediate town jobs fill up the list  cannot see the evening or next days jobs anymore.,btohqsg
must wait until like 10pm at night then can browse next day.,btohqsg
Hmm then maybe the issue is ppl taking more advanced than immediate,btohqsg
^ thats a good thing. if you were a customer booking in advance you would want early confirmation.,btohqsg
is there a way to feedback to LLM about putting the filters back?,btohqsg
But i think not so in realityMany issues with drivers come from advanced orders  and many get pban becos of itLate  no show  last min cancellations etc,btohqsg
You are the best when it‚Äôs comes to scamming,btohqsg
Yah in the midst of delivery,btohqsg
Half way broken chat and prompts user cancelled?,btohqsg
I was there 10am they gave me cash I accepted. Never inform me they r still preparing n late. I waited..,btohqsg
