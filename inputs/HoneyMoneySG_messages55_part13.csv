"google mcc for ""grocery stores  supermarket""",btohqsg
Means if you top-up $5k  only that $5k will enjoy fee waiver and not the whole portfolio?,btohqsg
yes  but need to use android phone in order to use Amaze via googlepay for Xnap. Amaze cannot be added to applepay fir Xnap.,btohqsg
Is uob evol a good first credit card for me as a young adult that just started working fulltime for about a year?,btohqsg
yes if your monthly spending fits online spend $250+mobile contactless $250+ $100 any payment mode,btohqsg
Can one category be more than the other? Like $100 online and $500 mobile contactless? Or must i hit both categories the min $250’each,btohqsg
Each category caps out at $250 ($20),btohqsg
8% online capped at $20 i.e. $250 spend8% mobile contactless capped at $20 i.e. $250 spendtotal min $600 in statement monthyou can spend more in one category but get less rebate. Anyway nowadays some offline spend can become online spend e.g. shopback pay  favepay  fairprice app  xnap etc,btohqsg
Total must be at least 600. But rebate is based on each category.,btohqsg
Ahh understand  thanks guys 🤙🏼 appreciate it,btohqsg
Does ordering food on grab considered as online spending?,btohqsg
You use credit card in grab to pay  don’t use grab wallet to pay. Then count as credit card spending.,btohqsg
to add on. Can consider say foodpanda instead  grabfood tend to be more expensive,btohqsg
Do subscriptions count as online spending? Like netflix  spotify  icloud storage etc. And does personal insurance and motorbike instalment falls under others category?,btohqsg
Installation don’t count. You may count insurance in other category  but nobody cares about 0.3% rebate.,btohqsg
so anyone doing the moomoo 5.8% thing?,btohqsg
can temporarily park for one month,btohqsg
this is so fake  it is an auto reply  then they even sent email,btohqsg
hi guys  does different bank activate their giro deduction at different times?,btohqsg
if you mean when deduction occur relative to due date  yes,btohqsg
okay...just feel insecure when they dont deduct in the morning especially for CC bills,btohqsg
why not both ?after clock for the $500 spend in uob oneremaining spend can use on citi reward + amaze,btohqsg
How can you calculate so accurately? If miss $1  you will miss all the rebate.,btohqsg
Is crmc + amaze still good? I saw the latest video  it says amaze fx spread is 2%  while crmc cashback is also about 2%. Now that they nerf the instapoints the net gain is less than 1%?,btohqsg
if keep track on uob one spend is troublesomecan just use uob one alone  easieror if you are able to get uob lady solitaire card thats even betterin my opinion,btohqsg
can refer to chris new video  he got explain the new amaze nerf,btohqsg
The calculations he used is based on mpd  which means if i use the citipoints for cashback (2%)  net gain is less than 1%?,btohqsg
Hi  I have tiger stock voucher(hkd88) expiring soon... May I know which safest stock to buy to encash it? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi everyone  how long did it took you to receive the UOB lady card after it was approved ? It has been more than 2 weeks now  i have only receive the lettre with the code 🥲,btohqsg
Call UOB CSO  it might be sent to wrong address?,btohqsg
My card and the letter of code came together  or one day apart cause I didn’t check my mailbox daily.Maybe someone else wrongly took your card or mailman wrongly sent to other address…Usually the letter of code comes after your card delivery.. so I guess you need to call UOB to resend your card…,btohqsg
What is the best card to buy on Fair Price Online?,btohqsg
need some advice here with Amaze. i will be paying my monthly recurring Giga bill using Amaze+crmc  however I also want to pay my dining using Amaze+Lady when i'm travelling overseas  etc. Does it mean that I need to know the schedule of payments and toggle between the cards in Instarem accordingly before the recurring payment is due? is there a better way to manage these payments?,btohqsg
just toggle to ladies card when you are gg to pay for your diningand toggle back after the payment is logged on your app (usually immediate),btohqsg
Are you getting 4mpd for the recurring giga bill?,btohqsg
Hey guys just wanted to check I just received HSBC revolution cc. I have did paywave for $400 worth of transactions and they only gave me 400 points which is 1x reward. Any idea if I’m doing something wrong here that I’m not getting the 10x reward?,btohqsg
Isn't gxs up to 75k now for 3.48%?,btohqsg
based on earlier convo above crmc+amaze is 4mpd. i used crmc alone and didn’t get 4mpd,btohqsg
i used crmc for fairprice app when paying at the counter and got 10x so i’m sure online would get u 10x,btohqsg
think i might forget since dining is part of everyday  and if i have to toggle to meet the recurring payment schedule of a few bills might not be worth the effort :/,btohqsg
hi guys  if i cancel my dbs altitude card  but still holding a DBS debit card.does that mean im not new to bank?,btohqsg

Where do u find this out?,btohqsg
Yes seems like it  great find!,btohqsg
yeah  its fine. been holding the card > 1 year,btohqsg
