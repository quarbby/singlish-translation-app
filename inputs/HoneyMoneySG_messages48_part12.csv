Hi all. A question on UOB Lady card. I'm thinking of getting one to use on following transactions:1) pay for hotel booking on their website in FCY.2) pay for hotel charges in a foreign hotel onsite in FCYSince Lady's card is Mastercard  can I pair it with Amaze to reduce FX spread? I haven't looked at the T&C so not sure if UOB excludes Amaze like DBS.If this card can't pair with Amaze  then I'll just use it as is since the mpd benefits will offset the FX spread and fee. Thanks!,btohqsg
Can i pair citi SMRT card with Amaze?,btohqsg
then can citi SMRT card earn points for paypal transaction?,btohqsg
As long as not excluded mcc,btohqsg
