Anyone know whr in jb sell the nfc tng card,btohqsg
in cold countries still ok ... but come to sg tsk tsk tsk,btohqsg
there's a reason why hotter climate countries favour Jap or kor cars.,btohqsg
i dont think this is the reason. because it is really hot in germany during summer. hotter than here. i think it has to do with their culture.,btohqsg
i think ah.. I THINK... its because its plastic...,btohqsg
for example: they like to use hard plastics or hard materials for many things. seats  plastics. the texture chosen is hard. look at the train or bus seatings.  hard also,btohqsg
naturally will disintegrate or decolour after a whileðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
many years ago  I sat inside a mercedes C class. the armrest door holder comes off so easily with finger nail scratch,btohqsg
how can this be so easily off.,btohqsg
ppl will still buy la even if whole car disintegrate . branding is everything,btohqsg
car is the easiest way to show your status,btohqsg
if the car is cheap enough  i wont mind rebuilding the whole car redo all the plastics,btohqsg

"""idiots... who wait for 5 mins for engine to ""warm"" up""",btohqsg
But I donâ€™t need heated seats,btohqsg
Good for those who don't want the option but don't want to lose out on the resale value because hardware will be installed,btohqsg
And heated seats are something that are seasonal  so if you keep the car for 1 to 3 years at max  can save some money instead of paying one shot,btohqsg
But who will want heated seats in sg?,btohqsg
If got cold seats I donâ€™t mind,btohqsg
Not everything for Singapore ah sir,btohqsg

Just because we have the most ex cars in the world doesn't mean we have the biggest market... we don't mean a thing in the grand scheme of things,btohqsg
