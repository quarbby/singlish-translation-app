I just checked the T&C. Looks like Geneco not allowed as the MCC is 4900. But looks like SP Group is ok because MCC is 7299? Can anyone confirm this? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
cash definition is very straight forward right  dont think need further explanation,btohqsg
you parent give u 50 cash is cash then if they give u nets card is what,btohqsg
"Well  It's like AXS  certain bills particularly loans you can't pay with CC  DC but accepts paynow and NETS. NETS to me in a way represents ""direct cash"".",btohqsg
maybe u can try your nets at hawker etc that take cash only loh. cash will always be cash no matter how u think.,btohqsg
even paynow is not cash  money come in alot of form  cash is one of those.,btohqsg
7-11 have a bunch of payment terminals though. Anyway I am not here to argue. Thank you for helping out. Maybe I will give this ichange 7-11 a try...see what happens.,btohqsg
the rational behind why nets and card payment not allow for top up is that there is fee involve in all these payment processing terminal  7 eleven will not be willing to fork out all these fee just for you to top up which ever account. so only cash is allowed,btohqsg
I don't use their service often if not at all.,btohqsg
Let's just say that top up services in 7-eleven has existed since I was a kid and even back then EZ-link top up costs like $0.50 per service. So 7-Eleven definitely knows better,btohqsg
now still 50 cent per top up,btohqsg
alot of kid still do ezlink top up at 7 eleven because they can top up 5  the top up machine at mrt and bus interchange required 10 minimum,btohqsg
anyway i think the focus is more on what cash versus other mode of payment is rather then 7 eleven payment system. the recent breakdown of dbs network is a good reminder that cash and contactless payment (paynow  paylah  net qr) are not the same.,btohqsg
12F Gerald crescent? That is landed residential area near Seletar hill. 😁,btohqsg
i think alot of member have comment that sp and geneco does not qualify for evol  sp and geneco does work for uob one,btohqsg

Hi Guys Currently the Maybank Amex Premier 2 card in Malaysia recently underwent a revision  transitioning from a 5x TP = RM1 rate to 2x TP = RM1. Given this adjustment  I am exploring alternative strategies to enhance my airmiles accumulation.Is it better to use SG credit cards such as UOB Lady  DBS Lady  or Citi Rewards  in conjunction with the Amaze card in Malaysia? How is the charge fee and conversion rate?,btohqsg
I think not many of us are familiar with MYR credit cards but that seems like a huge nerf. An equivalent rate for 4 mpd to RM will be 1.15 miles per RM1 and 6 mpd to RM will be 1.7 miles per RM1. based on exchange rate of 3.45,btohqsg
But my frd just check the amaze card convert rate record is 3.35 only if spending at Malaysia,btohqsg
That sounds like a separate topic but You may ask your friend to watch this video first.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM?si=u6VQvJBBL4v3Sm24,btohqsg
what kind of experience u referring to  my dad got this but i told him to cancel coz earn rate is very normal compare to other uob card,btohqsg
Anyway  now the best MY credit card convert to Krisflyer mile is only RM2.5 per miles. I will work out if using amaze + citi reward/UOB is better in MY,btohqsg
I like this definition of kiss the terminal. Shall use it next time,btohqsg
but it really depend if your lifestyle fit the benefit given with the card  if those benefit dont suit you then it is not useful loh like in my dad case.,btohqsg

Do banks cancel our credit cards when they find out we have stopped working?,btohqsg

Hi all just to check. I kinda need to use my UOB KF card today but it hasn't arrived. Does adding it to google pay mean that it is considered as online spend (coz to earn 3mpd should be online spend)  or is it considered as mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Tap machine using card is contactless.Tap machine using phone is mobile contactless.Paid using gpay is online.Mobile contactless won't show as gpay  it will show up as how you do it using card to tap on machine.,btohqsg
No idea. Like that means retirees will loose their cc,btohqsg
The annual fees still there when check online,btohqsg

Do they keep have access to our cpf and iras?,btohqsg
Well Trust and Stan Chart are related but not related so congrats you literally picked the only 2 banks that have some form of link,btohqsg
Bcos you inform trust bank and stanchart are related with trust bank. That why.,btohqsg
Only communicated with Trust. Have not contacted Stanchart for few years,btohqsg
Then bank have breach customer data in a certain sense coz they share data between different entity,btohqsg
Maybe there's fineprint that allows Trust to share customer data with Stanchart,btohqsg
FYI  Trust bank is powered by SCB.,btohqsg
when i apply for SCB card  they are asking me how much credit limit do i want to transfer over  or split accordingly.,btohqsg
https://trustbank.sg/legal/general-terms-and-conditions/Seems big enough  lots of SCB mention here and there,btohqsg
Does topup Grab Wallet using UOB One Credit Card counts towards UOB $500 CC spending?,btohqsg
So did U do something to let trust or scb know u are unemployed.Granting them access to SingPass data which contains employer / cpf contribution / Noa is a sure way to sabotage yourself.Always read what they are pulling from SingPass before u say yes.,btohqsg
Had used new Trust function to request for credit limit increase and selected Not working option,btohqsg
One last hope / chance for uDo u have investment income be it SSBs or tbills or rental or fixed deposit.At least show something. They can still give u a minimal credit limit.,btohqsg
Oh wah legendary granny here also,btohqsg
If you ain't working  chances are you will get lesser credit or no credit limit  think of it as a loan. Banks need some form of record to show that you have a way of paying them back (or rather  a proof that you can pay your CC bills),btohqsg
That will be a secured credit card  if I really need one from them.,btohqsg
Yes because that's the only type of credit card you are eligible for,btohqsg
There are banks flexible enough to deem investment income as regular income. Provided u can meet $30k per year consistently.,btohqsg
So@malemanX  do you fit this criteria instead?,btohqsg
Hi guys  quick check compared to SYFE Guaranteed 3.8% why would anyone opt for UOB’s previous National Day and new Christmas ProMotion where pledging $50 - 200k is necessary but only getting 1-2% monthly return over 4 months?,btohqsg
I paired my Citi rewards to Amaze  paywaved using physical Amaze card but I don’t see the points reflected on Citi bank app  does it take a while or it will only reflect only per transaction statement?,btohqsg
wait 1-2 business day after transaction posted,btohqsg
cos this cashback is in addition to the 5% interest on uob one account for $100k balance  3% on uob stash,btohqsg
In other words  it would not make any sense for someone to put in or pledge more than $100 000 in either account technically is that right? 😅,btohqsg
Nope. I'm invested but not enough high returns,btohqsg
Yes  unless you don't mind 0.05% above 100k lol,btohqsg
So sad  I just applied the previous promo,btohqsg

us risk free govt debt is paying 5.3%pa  for very short lockup of 3mths. anyone can explain why should we park money in sg where us govt bonds u get to enjoy higher interest rates  shorter lockup and lower risk!?😬,btohqsg
How do you determine US govt bonds are lower risk than SG govt bonds?1) Currency risk2) There's either commission paid to the brokerages if buying indirectly  else conversion fees plus a couple of hoops to jump through to buy directly3) 3 months sucks if you view it as a very low risk + high interest  more people would rather lock up for longer term with those two factorsIts not clear cut,btohqsg

I see cardup if I pay 4200 insurance I get charge 117$  fee.... Is it consider worth to use cardup?,btohqsg
Have you searched chat history using the keywords “Cardup worth”?  Other people also asked the same question before. 😀,btohqsg
Trying to search coz new to telegram,btohqsg
Clicking on the 400 plus list... Paisay,btohqsg
To briefly answer  you must see what card you're using to pair with CardUp  their website has a calculator for that. You are usually buying the miles when paying these fees so it comes down to how much every mile is worth to you.,btohqsg
For UOB Krisflyer card… Anyone know if Pelago is considered online travel? Pelago is SQ’s own online travel,btohqsg
You may want to read its TnC. UOB Krisflyer awards miles bydescriptionof online travel agency. Not by online travel.,btohqsg
Yea I was just going through… there’s specific online travel agents but Pelago not included.I just find it weird coz it’s SQ’s own business but not included. Also not sure if the TnC is updated.,btohqsg
Directly interact via Kris+ I think won’t have to worry right ?,btohqsg
Alright…  to play safe  shall use other card,btohqsg
U mean via the kris+ app? I may need to try a small purchase to test it out,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer is from UOBPelago is from SQ.Two different companies.,btohqsg
This just means that Kris+ transactions don't count to the $800 required to unlock the accelerated miles rate for other categories. Kris+ will still earn 3 mpd.,btohqsg

To link foreign visa master card to wechat pay for payment.You can search the news.,btohqsg

Hello gurus. I have alrd fulfilled UOB prvimiles spend requirement. They just charged me the annual fee  I’m not sure is the annual fee worth the additional 20000 miles. Furthermore the annual fee is $259.2,btohqsg
depends on your valuation of miles,btohqsg
What would you wanna pay then say unsure? Just transfer the miles and use it after 1 year you will find out if it is your cup of tea.,btohqsg
It was charged automatically. There is an option to waive it.,btohqsg
You shall do the calculation before applying the card but not get the card n spend to meet minimum  then ask.,btohqsg
I have specifically covered the UOB PRVI New customer offer here. Ultimately  if you're not chasing miles  then it wont make sense for youhttps://youtu.be/Tvd_QsHIp-I?si=dWGhyJbNGBLYT29Z,btohqsg

Hi  i hv just purchased a Agoda booking through the dedicated link for UOB Privimiles card. Supposed to receive base miles of 6mpd  but after it got posted on my statement it reflects only 1.2mpd.May i know is this an error or something else?,btohqsg
Hi all  for uob one interests  the first 30k savings  is 3.15% or 3.85% if I spent $500 every month + salary credit?,btohqsg
So far I gotten is 3.15% but how to get 3.85%?,btohqsg
Which day n what time did you transfer the money $30k into the account in Oct? Did you withdraw any amount from the account in Oct 2023?,btohqsg
I mean.. I have salary crediting every month normally last day of the month  then I have fulfilled $500 spending. So it hit level 2. With the monthly average I calculated to be 3.15%.. I thought should be 3.85%. I haven’t hit 30k yet.,btohqsg
Interest calculation is based on daily balance. If you did not put the money into the account on 30 September  you won’t get full interest in October because 01 October is Sunday.,btohqsg
If your salary was credited on last day of the month  likely it will be posted on next month. Then the salary will be counted as next month transaction.Check the posting date of your salary.,btohqsg
Will it affect the bonus interest if salary credited in and withdraw out on the next day?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Uob salary withdraw” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
If I pair my UOB ladies solitare (travel & shopping/retail) with amaze  and use amaze for all local transactions  will i get 6 mpd?,btohqsg

Is my understanding correct that amaze does not change the mcc  but it does a pass through of mcc to the linked card?,btohqsg

Hi all  is hsbc revolution cashback eligible on health buddy app (medical)   fwd travel insurance   Gomo auto payment ? Or should I just pay with Citi cashback + ? Thanks! 🙇🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
It’s Amaze*Transit  aka pairing your CC and use it for public transport.Not a blanket exclusion (eg DBS have a blanket exclusion on Amaze),btohqsg
What is the best way to perform the 7 trades required by MooMoo promotion?,btohqsg
It's refering to topping up those ezlink cards. BUS/MRT* (Tap bank card directly) for public transit isn't excluded.,btohqsg
What is the purpose of link to amaze? To see the mcc?,btohqsg
apparent he thought Amaze will change the mcc  which he later clarified to be not true,btohqsg
To use the linked card overseas,btohqsg
And it converts transactions to online  hence the reason why cr mc linked to amaze will earn 4mpd on non excluded spend.,btohqsg
Hi all  new to credit cards. Which credit card is suggested for cashback and miles ya? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all  how to setup hsbc giro with Everyday account ?Checkout through HSBC apps   didn’t found any option 😢,btohqsg
use physical interbank giro form from the billing organisation  or setup egiro from billing organisations that allow that,btohqsg
On converting transactions to online  do you have the online reference? I cant seem to find this,btohqsg
Wow ... annual fee so high !!!,btohqsg
it is trial and tested that all transactions via Amaze is online  lots of reviews on this,btohqsg
So does it mean its best if all the cr mc linked to amaze should reward for online txns?,btohqsg
yes  should get 10x points on Amaze+crmc so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Hi  may I know for Standard Chartered Smart card  how does the 6% cashback work? Is it based off each transaction or the final billing statement? 😅,btohqsg
I don't have this card but just by reading the T&Cs  it looks like they add up your transactions,btohqsg
If you happen to need to recontract your open electricity market provider  will you recontract now or wait till Jan 2024 to make the decision? The lowest i see so far is 29.52¢/kWhvs Q4 2023 SP Tariff 31.00¢/kWh,btohqsg
I see cos I didn’t receive any cashback thus far so I was just wondering but thanks alot for your opinion 😊,btohqsg
Need to redeem the points for cash back  refer to videohttps://youtu.be/4P65pCuddXE?si=dSpsOGKPsQTLdRB0,btohqsg

hmm should remain around the same,btohqsg
Ohh thank you so much! 🙏,btohqsg

Why does my due says 226.40 when I’ve already paid my credit card bills?,btohqsg
This is very confusing. Unlike UOB One which clears the statement balance once you pay it,btohqsg
This is Standard chartered bank. I pay via bank transfer. I transfer money from UOB to SC and clicked pay credit card bills,btohqsg
That's how SC app works. You have to manually account for how much you've paid vs statement balance.,btohqsg
That’s so dumb. They should fire their UI/UX designer LOL,btohqsg
They've changed their UI at least 4 times in the past year. It's a joke how much they make things worse each update.,btohqsg
Exactly. Their designers are trash and their product team is worst for allowing this to happen,btohqsg
did you managed to try it?,btohqsg
Click on View Outstanding. Actually it should show outstanding on the home page,btohqsg
They should already have tons of ux ui designers 🤔,btohqsg
Btw when did you pay? It takes a few working days for SC to receive the money,btohqsg
Outstanding and due amount should be separated. If I paid off my due amount  there’s no reason for it to still show up,btohqsg
Last week. Already more than 4 days liao,btohqsg
This view is statement view. Just dun click it loh,btohqsg
U can check your transactions to see if they received the money. Sometimes it takes longer to reflect  but as long as you pay before due date should be ok,btohqsg
"tap on the ""view oustanding"". You can toggle to see outstanding and due amounts",btohqsg
I know. Outstanding and due amounts are separate things. Shouldn’t due amount be $0 the moment they confirmed your payment?,btohqsg
And yet they can’t do a good job. They’re clearly very bad at what they’re doing,btohqsg
It’ll show unbilled (but posted) outstanding + outstanding balance from previous statement (if any),btohqsg
I tried mcc is 5812. using alipay,btohqsg
I can't. I need to cancel my wechat pay to re setup a new wechat pay. But because I have a 0.57 yuan in my wallet  I can't cancel account  and can't withdraw cos I don't have China cc card. Facepalm,btohqsg
Average daily balance will affect bonus interest?,btohqsg
hmmm weird. mine did not require any.,btohqsg
Hi all experts  my 100K for uob one account has been marked as Earnmarked for National Day promotion and I still can earn 420 interest for spending 500 ?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  it show account balance no longer 100K in my one account and since this 100K can’t be withdraw,btohqsg
Hi   I saw u have similar question with me.. do you earn the interest ?,btohqsg
It's not exactly 420 every month it's based on the number of days in the month so it fluctuates. Nothing to be of concern about,btohqsg
Ok 👍 how about giro to pay hsbc credit card with everyday AccI should expect stg easy to setup through apps,btohqsg

Not for plat chargeIf they waive for you why give you all the credits and vouchers?,btohqsg
True... What about the amex krisflyer ascend card? These also got free hotel stay 😅 also difficult to waive?,btohqsg

For the lady card under travel  oversea spend is it consider?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc under travel. can also pair with amaze to reduce fx fees,btohqsg
I see.. cos I currently got citi reward pair with amaze.. I think citi flight and hotel excluded right?,btohqsg
That why want to get uob lady card and that is for travel.,btohqsg
yup travel explicitly excluded on citi rewards,btohqsg

If online  go for Citi SMRT,btohqsg
cap 1k same like citi reward.. make no different to go apply it,btohqsg
yea and only get 4mpd for a limited whitelist of mcc and merchants  electronics mcc removed. Amaze+Citi rewards mc better as can get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
haha i was so outdated until you guys mentioned.. guess maybe need to waif for honey money to come out which card good for big purchase,btohqsg
you can also consider UOB KF due to its uncapped 3mpd,btohqsg

hi anyone shopped atishopchangi.combefore ?what is the verified mcc code ?,btohqsg
How does 7.8%/annualwork for uob one saving?Corrrct me if im wrong  shouldn't i get $214/month?,btohqsg
First 30k - 3.85%Next30k - 3.95%,btohqsg
Oh..so it is like this?First 30k - 3.85%2nd 30k - 3.85% + 3.95%,btohqsg
(3.85%/365*31*30 000) + (3.95%/365*31*3113.78) in your case,btohqsg
I believe UOB advertises it as up to 7.8%. You will get 7.8% on the 25k after 75k. So it means even if you deposit 100k  your EIR is 5% (which is already fairly high),btohqsg
Ah totally got it.5% is still pretty good. Not gonna lie 😂So ideally  if i have 100k cash  just dump it in uob for maximum interest right,btohqsg
Any more than 100k is not worth it.,btohqsg
For the $500 min spend  can we use the digital card first? Or have to wait to activate the physical card?,btohqsg
Hi experts! If im looking to make a 2.5k euros purchase on a luxury brand's website (foreign domain)  is citi SMRT card the best card to use? Would be NTB too. Grateful for any input  thank you!,btohqsg
Smrt good for cashback  depend if u are cashback priority or miles priority,btohqsg
Is amaze + DCS Ultimate the best combi for overseas spending with no min. spend?,btohqsg
Why dcs ultimate? I think that one give you 2%  then amaze take 2%  then no benefit right haha,btohqsg
wow new to citibank 😲 if you're looking on the miles side  can consider either uob lady solitaire (6mpd cap at 3k) or uob kf (3mpd). Can pair with amaze  do check mcc whitelist,btohqsg
UOB KF 3mpd for selected mccs and need to be online (can use Amaze)Do check MCC with Heymax first,btohqsg
Whats the best method to fund ibkr with usd? Fund with sgd then convert usd in the platform or fund usd directly from bank muti currency acc?,btohqsg
If i already have citi reward which change to krisflyer mile then this UOB KF also can add in to my krisflyer mile?,btohqsg
Any idea if UOB ladies solitare can earn 6mpd on all Agoda/booking.com/airbnbtxns?,btohqsg
Sure  I believe every card in Singapore can transfer to krisflyeredit: uob kf would go direct to kf,btohqsg
Not really sure what you mean but- UOB KF and CRMC both supports point accumulation with Instarem Amaze- Points in UOB KF adds your miles directly to your krisflyer programme- Citirewards Thank you points require yourself to transfer points to your frequent flyer programme (e.g. KrisFlyer),btohqsg
so the krisflyer point can stack on each other right,btohqsg
just wanna check how long must i hold a SC card before i can cancel to prevent claw back of rewards? Try to read the T&C but they didnt state (or maybe i couldnt see),btohqsg
Sure if your category is travel,btohqsg
If can't meet minimum spend of other cards (for higher cash rebates)  I suppose amaze + dcs ultimate is the best?,btohqsg
Yup one of it is travel,btohqsg
Don't have this card but don't think it works out  amaze 2% is also not fixed and sometimes could be higher or lower. So if you have no better cards  I would use amaze directly or revolut/youtrip etc,btohqsg
Joseph explained it quite well  not quite sure what you mean by stacking in this case,btohqsg
If want to use a credit card instead? For general spending with no. min spend,btohqsg
Frequent Flyer Program (AirAsia miles la... Krisflyer points la..) is one thing  CC points is another  just make sure the cards and your FFP's name matches and there shouldn't be an issue,btohqsg
Co-brand cards go directly straight to FFPPoints card (like CRMC) u need to manually convert to FFP (which may incur a transfer fee)  hopefully that clarifies,btohqsg
what cards u have and what r u spending on?,btohqsg
Same as Syfe and StashAway guaranteed return  does endowus have similar product as well?,btohqsg
Hi Guys. I will buy $1 000 SGD ticket with Singapore Airlines soon and I'm exploring suitable UOB credit card options.I'm considering the UOB Lady's  UOB KrisFlyer  and UOB PRVI Miles credit cards.

Just general spending.... no specific kind,btohqsg
I would say go withUOB Krisflyerhttps://hmsg.link/uobkrisflyersince it is alreaady SQ spending,btohqsg

Hard to say if dunno what card u have. If u feel amaze+dcs ultimate works for u then go for it lor.But to me it doesn't make sense because card gives u 2%  amaze takes 2% (variable)  no net return + the uncertainty over amaze's rateEdit: As mentioned by Trazora DCS does not give cashback for amaze txns  so it definitely doesn't make sense,btohqsg
read the TnC for the mc version.....,btohqsg

If I not wrong  yes you can use digital card.,btohqsg
SRS you can still take out the money if required (taxable)  so it really depends on what is important to you.,btohqsg
To maximise your income tax rebate. Do the below.1. Throw 8k to your own CPF SA.2. Throw another 8k into spouse CPF SA.3. Throw another 15 300 into SRS. Can be use to buys shares  SSB  T bills.8k + 8k + 15 300 = 31 300 deductable from your income tax. Big difference if your deductable income tax is between 11% and 7%.,btohqsg
If spouse is working then no point throw 8K for spouse SA/MA.,btohqsg

I am planning to get a miles cc for other soendings (travel/retail etc) and came across hsbc revol. So here is the qn  if i plan to get the hsbc revol cc  is it worth to open an EGA aswell to try and qualify the 1% cashback (simply by xfering 2k monthly from my uob one acc) ?TLDR  if i have a UOB One acc alrdy and i want a HSBC REVOLUTION CC  is it worth opening an EGA acc and xfer 2k monthly inside to qualify for 1% cashback,btohqsg

Not worth to scatter around .. focus on UOB one till you have more savings beyond 100k ..my 2 cents.If you need a miles card suggest Citi PM or UOB KF for starters,btohqsg
try to link your daily expenses online. like grab or ntuc app all these in app payments are considered online. or use xnapp app instead of usualy paylah.,btohqsg

Hi does Amaze usually meet their delivery date? Mine seems to be a few days late so far.,btohqsg
Depends if you can stomach the 2k balance staying and sitting in  HSBC EGA.  (unless u can qualify for premier banking)1% isn't really much   are you planning to use this card often outside of Dining covered by your UOB Lady's ?,btohqsg
"Avoid UOB$ merchants (unlike UOB ladies  u get nth if using UOB KF at UOB$ merch)Also cause ""whitelisted MCCs"" outside of dining or SIA-group txns requires to be ""online"" for 3mpd",btohqsg
basically  i am looking to get a general spending card to pair with my UOB Lady’s. Whether its cashback/miles. My main criteria is 0 min spending and if possible no annual fee. Unsure if you have any other opinions but the HSBC Revolution seem to be the “best” to me. (Open to opinions) Altho i did consider Krisflyer UOB CC (since i have a UOB Kris Savings i opened a while back  but most of my eggs are in UOB One)  but it doesnt fit my abv criteria.I looked at SC Smart but HSBC seems to be more flexible to me. I m not v good w calculating this so i am just curious if there is anyone who made some calculation on whether if opening the HSBC EGA just to put 2k in monthly + the 1% cashback is more optimal than just holding the HSBC Revol alone,btohqsg
General spending then uob prvi lor.And uob kf (why not both).Points pool in UOB,btohqsg
1 thing which is keeping me hesistant is the $5 earn block. So i am looking at other $1 earn block options,btohqsg
UOB KF requires spending of $800 on SIA group so do consider that as part of your requirement but for your case why not get CRMC w Amaze  then transform your lady’s to travel,btohqsg
im not sure if it is updated  but for apple users  does Amaze work?,btohqsg
Problem I foresee with this is you might lose out on two months of interest so  see see ah.. (also need to consider your travelling merchants  UOB KF travel don’t count by MCCs  but look at specific merchants ),btohqsg

ya  but that one got UOB Lady's assuming want to retain current setup,btohqsg
else bobian i guess  really need HSBC revo liao (assuming most of these txns are below $5 😅),btohqsg
Why not WWMC though? Revo also can but a lot of ppl are wary about HSBC rn especially with the T1 card conversion fee,btohqsg
1. I forget tbh2. WWMC u need to work out first if u can hit minimum block in time (their points have only 1 year expiry)To me conversion fee is more or less need to soak one (Update: *only if cash* )  unless you are fine with a co-branded card which credits points directly which means expiry ticker counts immediately[Also in the case of UOB  $5 blocks..],btohqsg
Conversion is one thing but when you need to pay 4k miles just to convert a bit too much,btohqsg
oh u mean the HSBC T1  ya i don't understand the logic either 😂,btohqsg
Gonna cash it out in Xmas lolol,btohqsg
Right now Revo still under the old system but people are wary if HSBC will suddenly spring the new system onto them,btohqsg
That... has never been something i thought of but now you mentioned it  it's a possibility (esp. since points pooling was highlighted before as part of the roadmap),btohqsg
Definitely will have ppl complain. especially if they have paid the annual conversion fee just before,btohqsg
T1 card currently waives conversion fee but from January onwards  HSBC will charge 10k HSBC points (= 4k KF miles) per conversion for T1 card. Other HSBC cards eg Revo are still under the regular fee structure ($43 for unlimited conversions per year) but some people are scared HSBC will change to the new system.,btohqsg
Even 43 per year unlimited conversion turn me away from the card. Who can spend so much to keep do conversion in a year,btohqsg
Some hardcore people transfer twice a year... Like that already $50 under other banks,btohqsg
There is one such call conversion bonus lol  waiting for that before i convert large amt  i only convert near expiry if not conversion bonus,btohqsg
Noted tomorrow 359pm last day to sign up for webull.,btohqsg
So this also mean  sg EZ-Link card is a complete failure to capture market as they have been in the wallet market for many years,btohqsg
Yes Revo is a good card,btohqsg
Hope will not impact the Revo 🙏,btohqsg

Hi gurus  can i ask if i am using instarem amaze + citirewards combo to spend locally dining in  will the rewards be 1x or not at all?,btohqsg
oooooo but i was seeing citi website  it says 10X Rewards ^ (4 Miles) on online and shopping purchases.,btohqsg
When you link citirewards to amaze  all transactions are considered online,btohqsg
ohhh nice nice  so its more beneficial to use this combo than a posb everyday card(in the case  if u dont hit the min 800 sgd spend)?,btohqsg
yes as no minimum spending required and round to nearest 1 dollar to earn miles,btohqsg
but posb everyday can be quite useful for sheng siong and other good cash back cat,btohqsg
oh yes  esp the big sales on lazada  shopee  amazon  depends on tht month also...bc if i dont spend a few hundreds on those platforms mentioned..abit pointless to tap the posb onto dining,btohqsg
also can I ask is it better to top up onto amaze wallet or use the linked bank to do transactions in foreign countries for dining and shopping?,btohqsg
depend if u want better exchange rate or dont mind the fcy and get card rewards,btohqsg
better exchange rate would be to use the amaze wallet ya?,btohqsg
yes  but ichange have better rate then amaze at the moment but might varies against difference currency,btohqsg
What about for transactions like ClassPass or gym memberships? Since it’s alr an online transaction. Would it be wiser to transact it via citi rewards straight or thru the amaze card?,btohqsg
U mean local spending? U can transact with citi reward directly unless u want to see mcc code,btohqsg
Can someone explain to me why my standard charter outstanding balance is showing +$226? Why is there a + there? Does this mean I overpaid my bills?,btohqsg
Guys  any idea if CIMB’s Balance Transfer admin charge are negotiable if I were to take a higher amount.I know UOB is negotiable but not sure CIMB.,btohqsg
First reason is over payment of bill. Second reason is there are refunds from your purchases/spendings to you via your card. Third reason is cashback from SCB.,btohqsg
Second and third is not possible. So it’s over payment la? WTF is wrong with standard chartered designers? Am I the only one who is confused with their UI? How is it that someone can over pay their bills until it becomes positive? LOL,btohqsg
Hi guys  I just got the CIMB card to enjoy the promotion. I can’t add this card to my Apple wallet. Is there a workaround?The best part is XNAP! only supports Apple Pay!,btohqsg

i am not sure about ichange. can u draw physical cash out from ichange? vietnam is a cash based society  most places dont accept credit cards especially if u go markets,btohqsg
I installed Google Pay…I’ll try use Google Pay instead of XNAP! for QR code payment and link it to my CIMB card…,btohqsg
Android is so vulnerable to scammer attacks,btohqsg
Yes can withdraw cash using ichange debit card via Maestro ATM but dont know whether the overseas ATM charge a fee or no.Hope someone tries out and let us know,btohqsg
Wondering if say ichange wallet  have VND and SGDIf we use the ichange mastercard for payment in vietnamIt will automatically deduct VND right?,btohqsg
QR scanning on Google Pay can only be used for paynow  cannot scan xnap,btohqsg
To be fair  Android phones will give you multiple warnings if a malicious app askes for dangerous permissions before that happens. If you blur blur give app those permissions only then can the scammers do anything,btohqsg

Morning everyone.. first time trying XNAP.. aft installed  it straights linked to my GPay.. May I know if I scan QR code to pay  I know it will pay with GPay  but in GPay  it will pay using the linked Contactless Credit Card or our PayLah Account? sorry that i am pretty new in these..,btohqsg
yeah i know.. when it pay  it uses Gpay in XNAP.. what i mean is in the process of payment  it charges to our credit card or paylah?,btohqsg
U can choose the credit card u added in gpay,btohqsg
Thx Queenie.. U are always helpful and informative.. 😊👍,btohqsg
Meaning XNAP is the only QR Code Payment App that can straight scan to pay using our credit card.. unlike GrabPay  still need to topup their wallet and then pay from the wallet... correct me if i am wrong..,btohqsg
shopback  favepay also can pay using credit card,btohqsg
Hello! :) anyone knows if there is a cap on the number of times we can get new-to-banks CC rewards for Citi  CIMB  SCB or DBS? If there is a cap  where in the T&C is this stated? Or so long as cancelled/never hold in the past 6/12mths depending on the T&C is okay alrd?Also  if anyone has experience getting NTB rewards more than once either from bank/moneysmart/singsaver  grateful if you can share too hahas. thank u!!,btohqsg
single way or return trip ?,btohqsg
I think only bank know  they have data to see if user is just playing the ntb game to get reward or genuine customer. U can get blacklist by bank if do ntb too much,btohqsg
Then u will see alwaya rejected for ntb cc application and the bank wont tell u the reason,btohqsg
SCB has a cap as stated in their tncs.,btohqsg
May I please ask if you can refer me to it? Read through the moneysmart/singsaver and bank T&Cs but couldn’t locate it.Thank you!!,btohqsg
Standard Chartered Credit Card Sign-Up Promotion Terms and Conditions - Standard Chartered Singaporehttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/credit-card-sign-up-promotion/,btohqsg
Clause 5a. Not too sure if this cap applies if you apply through singsaver.,btohqsg
Seem like more of a reward cap then the numbe of time u can ntb,btohqsg
Oooo yea  I read that part too and didn’t think it applies as a cap on rewards since my NTB reward was an item from Singsaver (falls under 5b. so there is no cap actly).This is opposed to a reward directly from the bank which is usually in the form of cashback on the next statement month  in which case clause 5a. would apply as a cashback capIn essence  seems like there is no cap on NTB for SCB tho if you don’t get the direct cashback reward from SCB. Thank u for the thoughts ^^ :),btohqsg

Hello  does anyone know if there will be any admin fees and charges if I use my UOB evol card in Australia?Is this recommended?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
3.25% fee. But you're getting 8% cashback (6.67% effective cashback) from the card,btohqsg
For online and mobile contactless payment only.,btohqsg
I am sure in australia can use mobile contactless as they start paywave earlier then sg,btohqsg
But evol need to fulfill 600 minimum spending,btohqsg
3.25% fx fees and visa exchange rateNote that u get 8% for only $250 on mobile contactless  $250 for online  can do local spend for the remaining $100 needed to meet $600 monthly spend,btohqsg
Hmm everyone plays this game la  don’t think banks will mind :),btohqsg
