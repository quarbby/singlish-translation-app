Normally it's fine  I've done it multiple times but haven't gone there in a while so things may be different now,btohqsg
I mean at the end of the day they are running a business,btohqsg
If they let u take pictures of the cars  very nice of them,btohqsg
But if they don't they probably have a reason for it since it's private property,btohqsg
yeah. usually it's fine but I guess they switched up now,btohqsg
