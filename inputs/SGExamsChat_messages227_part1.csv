says the one who suggested the group in the first place ðŸ™„,btohqsg
The commoners suggest a lot of things   but it's the king who takes charge !,btohqsg
I banned a lot of people,btohqsg
But those were like people who advertise la,btohqsg
Woops  let's change that  jung hon is our king   all hail jung hon,btohqsg
tbh I think our discord has something like this,btohqsg
In a study group? Wow   that's bold of them,btohqsg
Yes I know discord has many study groups   just that my phone hangs so much on discord,btohqsg
There are people who do that,btohqsg
And I don't have a laptop,btohqsg
Discord is like the dark Web,btohqsg
discord is great and all but yea could get pretty laggy on my side too,btohqsg
It's dark and it's the Web,btohqsg
im in so many servers that i'll probably get distracted like shet,btohqsg
But for people with laptops discord is great for study groups though   I know one study group where there are like 10000 members,btohqsg
There are 1000 people studying always on cam,btohqsg
They have duo groups where two people can study together,btohqsg
like i said  any smaller grps tht i cn jusidkbe at v least chill with first,btohqsg
Look at all these people Studying,btohqsg
sure i send no. to u or my man jam,btohqsg
They also have like stats   and there are a few persons who study for like 400 hours a month,btohqsg
then again ik a guy who thinks 12h of studying isn't enough,btohqsg
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ how do people even do that,btohqsg
bruh i kinda wish i hv tht much discipline,btohqsg
Or maybe they just sit infront of the book and make up stories in their mind for 12 hours,btohqsg
but he did train himself ig,btohqsg
nah i know him q wellhe's sibei guai ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Glad to see SGExams discord isnâ€™t only the bunch of weirdos sitting deafened in a discord voice channel,btohqsg
how does studying in discord study groups even work tho,btohqsg
like other than using bots to remind or wtv,btohqsg
A lot of talk from the admin of a dying tele group chat!!,btohqsg
Die faster then I can run away,btohqsg
They just sit in a voice channel muted,btohqsg
I guess itâ€™s nice to know that someone on the other side of the screen is studying too,btohqsg
some dedication and discipline they have,btohqsg
Why you Asians are so obbssed with studying,btohqsg
if you're not asian or sporean or pr  then why are you judging,btohqsg
if you are  why are you still judging,btohqsg
I am an American  Anglo by blood,btohqsg
i mean  most of us are conservative and traditional when it comes to studying so,btohqsg
