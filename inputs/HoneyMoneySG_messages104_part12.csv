Thinking of taking out cash from one account and OCBC 360.What are the best places to put the cash in now? Other than moomoo and syfe / stash way guarantee ?,btohqsg
Depends on your salary  depends on your spending. You can check out Chris' YouTube video on the best cashback/miles card.,btohqsg
Did you manage to login to their app?Either there's an add to Apple Pay or Google Pay or see CVV button.,btohqsg
I'm suspecting that an authority-level entity made them suspend their services to either scam/abuse-proof their services  especially with the recent rise on those scummy people asking for businesses' QRs.I doubt it's a financial issue since they managed to operate SG  SK and PH  and expanding to JP  VN and KH.Don't quote my words  just thinking out loud 🤣,btohqsg
Hi  I have a policy (not under UOB) that is maturing and proceeds will be paynowed to my UOB. Will this be considered as fresh funds to qualify for the UOB savings promo?,btohqsg
Y not u PayNow to other account and transfer Into UOB to be more certain of it,btohqsg
Yes as its source is not from UOB & your Acct balance increased,btohqsg
Cause I alr set instructions for great eastern to paynow to the account before this promo came up. Hope can change the instructions in time.,btohqsg
Is it still possible to create an ibkr LLC account for SG users?,btohqsg
Now that XNAP is unavailable  what are other options we can use at hawkers?,btohqsg
Hi guys.. can I check if dbs women world Mastercard can earn 4mpd if use on Shopee(Apple Pay) or other Apple Pay payment online?,btohqsg
Sad. You could have gotten earmarked and out of earmark a month earlier since you already have the funds on 30 Apr.Unless.. you have existing earmarked funds in Jan and it only ends in May. 😩 But seems unlikely.,btohqsg
Should be fine.. GE belongs to OCBC and uses OCBC bank account anyway.,btohqsg
"""Best"" depends on what you're looking for. I wouldn't say ZYM $10 plan is the best. I'm sure@kelvintaninvestkeeps a pretty updated spreadsheet on all the SIM only plans. You can find it on his YouTube video.",btohqsg
LiquidPay is topped up using PayNow. People are paying with XNAP for the CC spend/rewards. So no.,btohqsg
If you don't intend to use UOB One for interest in May then just transfer out all today. Then withdraw the Apr bonus interest when it gets credited.,btohqsg

Your suggestions are not better than UOB or OCBC tho. It also depends how much money you have and what criteria you meet,btohqsg
The funds can shift now already? Cos the interest only coming tmr or day after,btohqsg
You planning to go for May's interest? If not then transfer today and transfer the bonus interest out when it deposits.,btohqsg
I want to trf out. Originally I wanted to trf to webull. But never expect their rewards nerf so badly . Now exploring hsbc,btohqsg
After month of May can trf back to uob to sign for the sign up rewards again?,btohqsg
hi all  understand that citi rewards points expire 5 years after card open. how can i find out when my card was first started?,btohqsg
No I mean new account? UOB's sign up promos don't need to be NTB if I recall.,btohqsg
UOB to keep 150k to get $500 a month. But with OCBC I don’t have salary crediting.,btohqsg
Why don't salary credit to OCBC then transfer in and out of UOB?,btohqsg
Because initially I don’t have a salary crediting. With UOB it does not have to be a company that credit a salary. For OCBC it must be made from corporate account,btohqsg
Oh not new account  trf back to original old acc. So uob may final 5% interest today can trf out or need to wait interest come liao then can trf out?,btohqsg
Oh. I'm assuming you still don't have salary credit  you can keep 150k in UOB One account (I'm assuming you also registered for earmarking promo for the 50k fresh funds).The rest you might want to check out HSBC EGA? You can register for the bonus interest promo (additionally with Everyday+ Rewards) and get 4.35% p.a. on fresh funds too.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/194175,btohqsg
Hi  is Xnap working on andriod?,btohqsg
Just transfer ba. No point storing inside,btohqsg

Cos the interest only coming tmr or day after I can trf out alrdy?,btohqsg
They already settled the interest already. Today is the start for the new month.,btohqsg
Your bonus interest is for Apr not May. Unless you also plan to close the account?,btohqsg
Understood. Paiseh me nv trf out of uob before.. want to do it carefully with clear understanding,btohqsg
If you don't mind keeping it in for a month then can look at HSBC EGA.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/194175,btohqsg
Hsbc sign up acc got any promo?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to see the breakdown of citi rewards point? I can only see total. Cannot see each transaction earn how many points.,btohqsg
Is it worth to sign up for an amex card so that i can use amex pay for hawker?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if use CIMB visa signature credit card pay for health hub payment does it consider approve spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
That's what you should be asking yourself.. do you think it's worth it lol. You gonna just use it for hawker? Without the hawker payments  your other card that you initially use can still hit the minimum spending?,btohqsg
Firstly  use Heymax check what is the mcc code of healthhub.Secondly  read the TnC of the credit card  search the mcc code of the eligible category using description in Heymax.Compare the two.,btohqsg
I got a question for UOB Big Savings Promo:I submitted the form on 30 Apr 2024 for 50k earmark.I deposited 50k on 30 Apr 2024 also.My MAB for Mar 2024 is 100 084.79.With 50k deposited yesterday  my 30th April 2024 Balance is only 150050.Is it I will not qualify for the earmark in May 2024 since my balance is 150 050  not 150 084.79?,btohqsg
Are you the actor Lin Ming Lun?,btohqsg
