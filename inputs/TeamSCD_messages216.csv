I think this year I no Paddock club chance,btohqsg
But ask me pay i won't go,btohqsg
is it okay if i ask for your opinions for a good first car   maybe yall can recommend,btohqsg
What car you have in mind?,btohqsg
Was looking at an audi s3 for months now,btohqsg
but most likely i wont spend so much money for a first so probably getting a manual,btohqsg
Wah s3 out of the question for first car siol,btohqsg
Get a swift or a fit for a start,btohqsg
Repair not gonna Burn a big hole,btohqsg
Once you know your budget then you can pick a car. But for manual it limits the choice.,btohqsg
But then again manual is a solid choice,btohqsg
Dun pick manual lah.. pick alr say real men use 3 pedals,btohqsg
But dun travel out of geylang,btohqsg
Dun breakdown if Not kachng also pain,btohqsg
I only worry the car not fierce than him,btohqsg
I buy this one need find AE86 owner's girlfriend to steal already,btohqsg
Need to be more uncle first,btohqsg
Hi anyone from bmw f3x chat group? I wish to join,btohqsg
Haha my dad js reco me sporty conti,btohqsg
Old dont go  new wont come,btohqsg
what ever your changing to also gold,btohqsg
the way i see is  if change to same year still ok  but change to more years bad for wallet,btohqsg
don't use up all your budget....,btohqsg
bt must see what car also,btohqsg
that budget you got evo  fd2r  euro r  ford focus  renault megan rs  etc,btohqsg
Why u forget wrx so fast,btohqsg
just not on my mind lol,btohqsg
or buy a 2 seater convertible while you still can,btohqsg
300k he can buy the 2 seater and a 5 seater,btohqsg
but with that kind of freedom to pick  i probably will go with a Mini Cooper S manual if you can find one,btohqsg
he need something that will spoil  bring to work shop all that,btohqsg
Do a 1 time good 1,btohqsg
Cerato forte also ok for first car :),btohqsg
got 1 red one selling cheap cheap,btohqsg
that price range swift sport probably a better bet,btohqsg
If pricing wise then as of now the depre abit high for a cerato forte i agree cus that kind of depre might as well conti,btohqsg
300k  bang liao total loss also nvm,btohqsg
Wah long time never tok here,btohqsg
yeah i feel mini is at a nice price range about there,btohqsg
thought you become some important person already then left,btohqsg
If only 2-3 years ago forte then worth to get,btohqsg
Jokes jokes but i q bz oso,btohqsg
Forte price nubbad as first car,btohqsg
but the car is average at best,btohqsg
My forte i got ard that time my depre 5.8,btohqsg
i had mine at under 4k depre,btohqsg
Honestly right if u dun care abt performance n js want first car the Jazz/Fit best choice,btohqsg
drove 2 years then sold off,btohqsg
If u want problem car  can get rocco (dont flame me  experience only),btohqsg
this one price reasonable  you just need friends with workshops,btohqsg
Now fit/jazz depre also one kind lei i see ü§£,btohqsg
I prefer jazz but jazz manual hard to find,btohqsg
GK even more rare edi but a lot of ppl Coe renew the older generations,btohqsg
Conti not suitable for first car. Unless you loaded.,btohqsg
Comparing rocco and golf i rather go golf,btohqsg
Now see 9k depre car thats at max from 2009 like find until treasure liddat,btohqsg
the amount he save up can full cash,btohqsg
I dun like Rocco cos it oni got 2 doors HAHA,btohqsg
But if  want aisin door stabilizer  save money hhaha,btohqsg
see if you always have passengers,btohqsg
yeah but also see what kind of image he wants to portray la,btohqsg
No ah cos roc I heard the FC q bad oso,btohqsg
maybe he is like some banker need a more executive looking car,btohqsg
My dream car in SG is Toyota wish eh,btohqsg
If tune  forged eng  stage 3,btohqsg
or he loan shark then need a tiong car,btohqsg
