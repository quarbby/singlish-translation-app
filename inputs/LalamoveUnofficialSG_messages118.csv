Hi guys  may I ask for those round trip logo seen in the app  but destination only shown from point A to B example Jurong to pasir ris. So how is it considered as round trip? The fare also doesn't looks like its paid for a round trip more like a single trip instead. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Round trip there's a extra charge actually..,btohqsg
I see but if distance far not worth that extra charge. Just wondering because I see the logo it says round trip but the address details only Point A to B instead of Point A to B and then back to A. Thought there's some error/glitch. Thanks for sharing.,btohqsg
Well mostly is courier ma.. car all those idk,btohqsg
"Some customer really try their very best to save up on the fees though by booking courier services but expect us to take up huge amount of items and some even stated in the notes ""Prefer car"" This morning I saw 1 ""Cake is very fragile have to be held upright at all times""",btohqsg
I ownself also carry more then 8kg items,btohqsg
The weight is 1 thing but sometimes the items are way oversized. When I was doing grabexpress some ask to deliver baby stroller and even fan and all that.,btohqsg
So now I have a habit of contacting the customer to double confirm on the items before I even proceed to the pick up location,btohqsg
Or else waste of time and petrol to travel to pick up point end up get surprise,btohqsg
For LLM can we cancel the order if let's say upon accepting order we try to contact customer to confirm order before going over but customer is uncontactable?,btohqsg
Unless you saying oddle  startaster all those Don need call actually,btohqsg
Ya I know for all these restaurant and those clinic kind no need to call. But other than that normally I see if no details I prefer to call and double check but if uncontactable can we cancel?,btohqsg
Yea you can.. but service quality will be affected..,btohqsg
Today i kena again   unit 06-25 but building dont have . Called them n being fussy . Atleast   give proper address n unit on notes .,btohqsg
Okay la  from 3 improve to 3.6,btohqsg
What's the service quality for actually?,btohqsg
For you to kup order easier,btohqsg
All i can see is 2 only,btohqsg
That's all I can see on my end,btohqsg
My reviews is pls improve behavior .,btohqsg
The 5 stars all those is customer,btohqsg
Treat the customer like vip can alr,btohqsg
Why each time called customers   they record our convo ?,btohqsg
Today they speak to me in malay .,btohqsg
I record it for safety tbh,btohqsg
It's okay.. traffic all those have to explain nicely,btohqsg
No i called them   they are the one recording .,btohqsg
Firstly   i apologised to them for being late .,btohqsg
Eventhough they speak to me in malay .,btohqsg
Cause im from bedok going to mdis .,btohqsg

When they send you the late message just explain to them,btohqsg
Almost all the one i called when taking order is   recorded .,btohqsg
I called bro not msges .,btohqsg
The system will give you a message to write a form explaining why you late,btohqsg

It's just too small for bulky items,btohqsg

It's ok I'm not looking for a big one. Already have a big bag mounted at my bike.,btohqsg
Just want to have a rough idea on how big it looks like,btohqsg
Ah... but it's kinda pointless.. is like 36L ish,btohqsg
A bit smaller than the standard 43L size,btohqsg
Because if buy the lalabag will get priority in getting orders and more filters option. Since I got alot of big bags I'm thinking of getting the small one. But I don't know if the small one Is small enough for me to slot in my bike.,btohqsg
How to let them know I have the bag ah,btohqsg
Actually ok leh not really that big just that the height is tall,btohqsg
Can meh I think they want us to buy from them direct?,btohqsg
I know the deliveroo small thermal bag can slot in my bike but not too sure if this small llm bag will fit. Thanks for sharing,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check anyone has not received the government payout yet?,btohqsg
How to tell collect from who?,btohqsg
Have to ask the sender.. that's how I know who's paying,btohqsg
Even if the system indicates who pays just double confirm first.. in case they put wrong,btohqsg

Thanks. I got it now after accepting the jobs,btohqsg
I’m on a walker account ($15) but I’m actually driving. Issit worth to change to car and pay the deposit? Any different?,btohqsg
Yes. I don't think you can accept car orders on a walker account. Car orders pay more,btohqsg
I see. the items will be heavier and bulkier too. Got it. Thanks!,btohqsg
Wow I’m impressed with west side drivers. Order disappeared almost immediately after it showed up 😆,btohqsg
Do we need to really call the customers after we take the order?,btohqsg
