tbh if I don't get into any of the unis I applied to I have no idea where to go liao,btohqsg
my choices would pretty much come down to SIM or grind moon runes to go to Japan,btohqsg
my grades and portfolio aren't good enough for uk/us and I have no talent for German,btohqsg
tbf uk/us probs can but then won't be like your v big name unis,btohqsg
too ex  and besides I'm going to overseas uni to live overseas,btohqsg
but anw regardless of whr u go for uni,btohqsg
u can still migrate to another country afterwards,btohqsg
i wld suggest u just apply for unis in the countries u want to go to,btohqsg
what's your definition of not good enough such that you don't even want to try applying,btohqsg
(also JP companies tend to prefer people who grad from JP unis),btohqsg
UK/US is mostly a cost thing  tbh,btohqsg
US uni costs are insane  UK COL has gone mad,btohqsg
also getting US residency is literally a lottery,btohqsg
u hv japanese language certification alr?,btohqsg
JLPT? not yet  wonder if I should go all-in on doing exam prep for JLPT N3 if I don't get in,btohqsg
i mean if you're dead set on japan only and not even considering countries then might as well start prepping for that and also start applying to their unis whenever they open,btohqsg
eh i wld ask what course and what score but,btohqsg
i wld say just apply regardless,btohqsg
unless you don't have the money for application fee,btohqsg
want to compete in valorant is it?,btohqsg

NUS High 2.8/5 CAP  roughly equivalent to 3.2-3.5 Poly GPA,btohqsg
sorry to say but i think u can start preparing to apply for your japan unis and SIM liao,btohqsg
based on your application choices esp,btohqsg
not even NTU EE will accept me?,btohqsg
EEE 90th percentile is 3.44 for poly  and also your 4th choice,btohqsg
i won't tell u how u shldve done your rankings,btohqsg
and i hope they offer u smth,btohqsg
tbf my college counsellor might have been overoptimistic  typical American college counsellors,btohqsg
if english/EEE/engineering was your first 3 choices u muight have more hope,btohqsg
if u have the freedom of 3 chances to apply,btohqsg
but unless u take a gap year,btohqsg
this is your one and only chance,btohqsg
tbf my college counsellors seem to hold the NUSH diploma in much higher regard,btohqsg
eh u grad from jc last Yr?,btohqsg
applied last november  still haven't gotten my results,btohqsg
ik COL n u want japan and stuff but,btohqsg
what if JP unis/SIM aso dw u,btohqsg
which would you rec besides AUS/UK/US?,btohqsg
anything else other than aus uk us is purely because u want to go thr so for u it's like  jp lor,btohqsg
been using PRC uni advice as a rough substitute (similar  if not harder  difficulty over there)  most PRC advisors suggest Japan  UK  US  AUS and Germany,btohqsg
as in the uni advisors are from china and the advice is made for china students,btohqsg
China unis are generally easier to get into I think,btohqsg
ok but regardless as a general advice to anyone here  do not go to a china uni,btohqsg
PRC ppl are flooding SG unis for a reason,btohqsg
unless u wna be stuck in china for the rest of your life  china uni degrees not v good,btohqsg
they're designed to keep u in china,btohqsg
no  but SG-based uni advice sucks for poor performers,btohqsg
practically nothing for overseas unis for poor performers beyond AUS,btohqsg
US/europe seems to basically be your only choices ig,btohqsg
