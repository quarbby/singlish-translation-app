It will count towards the 1k min spend.,btohqsg
maybe i should have asked them to void the transaction when i realised it was a mistake ü§° i suspected something was off when there was no tapping/paywave but i only confirmed it later after leaving the shop(first time using kris+. for some reason i thought pay via gpay means there'd be tapping/paywave involved),btohqsg
Anyone knows why Webull keeps indicating that I have no buy power when I have sufficient amount ?,btohqsg
The sufficient amount you mentioned is in cash or assets(stock/funs/etc‚Ä¶)?Is the currency of the sufficient amount same as currency of the products you plan to buy?,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say if I have $100 . Even if the stock was worth 0.07 per share . It still mentioned the same,btohqsg
I will try converting to US. Thanks,btohqsg
Anyone tried booking Expedia usingwww.expedia.com.sg/prvimilesbefore? Wondering how long it will take for the Uni$ to be reimbursed,btohqsg
If you book correctly  6mpd for expedia will get credited when transaction posted,btohqsg
What is a good UOB credit card to pair with UOB One Account my preference is to accumulate krisflyer miles,btohqsg
Man can apply for UOB Lady card?,btohqsg
Yes I am holding 1 myself.,btohqsg
hi guys quick question (havent done any research on this yet) -- does any card give more than 1.6% cashback for hotel booking on agoda?,btohqsg
Does anyone has any recommendation for insurance that just covers outpatient visits and dental? Asking cos company does not provide.. Admin .please delete if such question is not allowed? Thank you,btohqsg
These are typically offered under group medical plans. There are premium providers that cover for individuals but you‚Äôll need to pay a bomb which defeats the purpose.,btohqsg
"Do I need to take note of anything? I understand for Agoda need to take note of ""Earn 6 miles per $1 spend"" tag",btohqsg
Warning bout Agoda + Prvi 6mpd  I didn't get 6mpd for 2 of my bookings so you should be careful.For Expedia  use UOB landing page for Expedia and check tnc. I think only some airlines/airlines + hotel combinations are qualified for 6mpd.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. Group medical plans are those undertaken by companies?,btohqsg
Ya  I read the T&C  Agoda is very strict.Meanwhile Expedia is very clear-cut  there is a list of airline and hotel that is blacklisted,btohqsg
You got me dug up their tnc. üòÖFor airlines  there is a list of eligible airlines for expedia  not blacklist. Hotel then it follows blacklist approach.I know it's confusing.,btohqsg
Oh yes  thanks thanks! Appreciate it ü•∞,btohqsg
By the way  do you know how long do I have to wait before the additional miles will be credited?,btohqsg
For Expedia  additional miles are credited when posted. Don't need to wait very long.,btohqsg
Is there any way to appeal for this? Also any idea roughly when would the miles would be credited?I booked through the agoda+privi UOB too  with the particular room booking stating that it has 6mpd.,btohqsg
You can try fighting with UOB cso but I gave up on mine.,btohqsg
Ohh  for agoda  iirc they stated that the miles would only be credited after the stay  so perhaps I'll have to wait,btohqsg
ill take a look! thanks! why did Anthony react like that HAHA,btohqsg
Ya by right  after ur stay. Lemme if you get the miles btw. Mine didn't get credited after my stay.,btohqsg
"My reaction was when he replied with just ""Yes""  which is a valid reply for your question. üòÅ",btohqsg
Hi gurus  its just a few more days left. I am starting to plan for my next month's plan.May I know whats the take on the next UOB quaterly promo?,btohqsg
Ahh  will update you again  my stay is in oct,btohqsg
You are 24 days late for next quarter promo. Usually people emptied UOB one acct start of this month to prepare for that.,btohqsg

Oh its already empty since start of month. Now just gathering info to do a better informed planning,btohqsg
Then just wait for Oct 1 announcement and deposit it. I hope u keep that balance somewhere with good interest  eg EGA.,btohqsg
Is there a cashback for telco for citibank cashback? Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Not sure if falls under exclusion,btohqsg
citi cashback card 0.2%citi cashback plus card 1.6%,btohqsg
yes  usually for employees as benefits. the ones where individuals do take up for themselves can cover outpatient as part of the inpatient coverage but this is really costly. one such provider is cigna.,btohqsg
Yup  they are happily in EGA for nowüòÅ,btohqsg
I am just wondering given the recent fed cuts  the earmarking in the next UOB quarterly promo might be risky. Not sure if my concerns are valid. Or if there is any other school of thought. For discussionüëç,btohqsg
Ur fund is still in ega and earning interest anyway. If UOB promo is not as good  we gotta find new strategies lor.,btohqsg
Can i use uob credit card to buy iphone 16 under installments and get miles ??,btohqsg
Can buy under instalment but won't get miles,btohqsg
Anyone knows why Malaysian ringgit spend appear as 'Others' category instead of 'malaysian ringgit' category for maybank fnf? Does it take time to update?,btohqsg
Between UOB Lady Card and HSBC which is better for krisflyer miles spending,btohqsg
Same same till Jan 2025. How much is ur SQ tix?,btohqsg
Sir tat will burst the cap of either card. Better use UOB KF instead.,btohqsg
actually with all this 'risk' is it even worth it using special landing pages?i rather stick to the credit cards that give bonuses based on the MCC..instead of special tieups where the Bank has to rely on the merchant to give the green light before awarding the special bonuses?,btohqsg
So far I used UOB prvi on Expedia for eligible flights when I bursted the cap for UOB lady for the month. I find airfare isn't much different from official airlines site.Ofc booking via OTA will have problem with changing or canceling tix but it's a choice one has to make.Hotel on the other hand  I find dedicated landing page is more ex  for both exodia and agoda,btohqsg
very difficult to make use of these airlines!!! i think for me  CASH ticket  i will only use Korean Air.,btohqsg
