Same boat here :(Moved funds out to EGA on 1 Jun.Think calling CSO will help clarify on this?,btohqsg
For?? Value date will still be 1 Jul since yday is Sunday.,btohqsg
Hi All  I suddenly remembered someone said that their giro salary (self initiated) to uob one wasn't counted?There's this danger that once our funds are earmarked and if they stop this loophole  we will be royally screwed for the next 5 months with next to no interest! üò±,btohqsg
hi cardup experts! can anyone explain how the 2.25% cardup fee to pay insurance/taxes/mortgage loan would be worth it/not worth it? i‚Äôm planning to use dbs altitude visa for it but have no idea how cardup truly works in the miles game yet‚Ä¶ thanks! üôèüèª,btohqsg
100k in UOB Stash or second person's account,btohqsg
What for tho? Moving funds to another account?,btohqsg
Hi all  what is usually the best Citi signup offer? Should i wait?,btohqsg
Any citi cards that you are looking at?,btohqsg
anyon knows how to see the quarterly spending time frame of the uob one card ? or where i can find out,btohqsg
from the card statement  if statement not yet generated can ask via uob chat assist,btohqsg
https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculatorcardup has a calculator on their website. You can input the amount and find out fee and earned miles. In my screenshot  you will pay 1.83 cents per mile  which is a lot higher than avg reasonable cost of 1.1-1.3 cpm.,btohqsg
Most common use case is to use cardup to pay income tax pairing with visa card. at 1.75% admin fee  cost per mile is better. Honey Money SG has promo code for it so you can check it out.,btohqsg
Morning Yall! I need some advice as I‚Äôm going to spend around >$2k on Hotels  AirBnb and Air-tickets in Jul24 & Aug24. Planning to get 1 credit card for this. What credit cards do yall recommended?,btohqsg
can check amex cashback card  first 6 months & first 5k spend whichever comes first for unlimited 3% cashback,btohqsg
not unlimited  limit is 5k spend within first 6 months,btohqsg
uh yea for first 5k spend as said above  he need 2k+ only,btohqsg
i see thanks a lot! at least now i know it might not be worth it to use cardup for mortgage loan and insurance payments..,btohqsg
Just to check if any confirmation sms or email upon registration on scb save up level up?It just tells successfully submitted. Not sure if good to start deposit right now,btohqsg
I asked UOB CSO she said deposit today is fine but I think I may still be kiasi and transfer tmr,btohqsg
i think the intention is to avoid people after signup for earmark go and withdraw the money and only put back the money a few days before anticipated earmark...,btohqsg
Good morning all  I know I ask before but still do not really understand the mechanism. I would like to check on HSBC ega. If I open an account today and deposit my money inside and then I withdraw it and put in say uob one account on 31st July  would I get the interest from ega assuming I did the 5 transfers please? Thank you.,btohqsg
yes  need to sms register for the 3.x% bonus interest,btohqsg

Oh now so low no more 4.x%,btohqsg
Yes  only notify the submission. I deposited right after for the previous campaign,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you so much,btohqsg
Has anyone SMS to register for HSBC EGA already? Is the SMS acknowledgement accurate?,btohqsg
I did the UOB Plunging Chicken website registration. All in order.,btohqsg
Ok I know what you mean.. hmm,btohqsg
From UOB one acct transfer to UOB stash acct is it considered fresh fund?,btohqsg
No. Cannot be from existing uob acct.,btohqsg
If transfer out to other bank and transfer in again  then ok  correct?,btohqsg
This time round  UOB also has the 30 days fresh funds clause.I don't think anybody here can 100% tell you how UOB is going to interpret and enforce this clause. So see how safe you wanna play.,btohqsg
I would just say I feel it would be close to impossible (but not impossible) for UOB/HSBC to enforce it 100% since everybody's account will have some form of inflows/outflows within 30 days for example:1. salary credit2. interest payment3. giro fundsThe above applies to both HSBC and UOB (since all having this stupid 30 days clause too),btohqsg
Of course  do a few hoops and variations before transferring the fund back to uob to avoid being too obvious.  Ex: use a different external account to transfer to back to UOB. We wont know how UOB check it  but they can reject it one day as fresh funds and we wont have much grounds to dispute it.,btohqsg
For SP bills using uob one card .. for recurring still get cb right ?,btohqsg
Remember UOB CSO have high rate of being wrong. She might not even know about the 30 days thing.,btohqsg
If you searched  you'll find dp that says yes,btohqsg
I just waiting to see more dp for fall below fee eating into negative. UOB and OCBC have dp already.,btohqsg
Yah I specifically asked about 30 days. Shall be kiasi,btohqsg
For webull deposit promo  is keeping 13.8k sgd till end of July fine? The tnc said usd 10k repeatedly  and somewhere mention currency exchnage rate that. confuses.,btohqsg
Check with Webull CSO on the app  specific T&Cs according to each month,btohqsg
everything is 'caught' under that stupid sentence so i really doubt they can/will enforce it,btohqsg
In the STRICTEST interpretation.. all cashflows RECEIVED in the 30 days before 1st July  needs to be excluded/added.for example uob savings promo  even if your MAB is $1000  but you have salary of $10k in  bonus interest $500 in..and you signed up $150k earmark.. by right you need to maintain:$1000 + $10 000 + $500 + $150 000 throughout the ENTIRE PROMO (which obviously is stupid).,btohqsg
Haiz I only 1 ega account  plus person 2 for merry go round  then giro with my account to earn bonus interest.. Now how liao,btohqsg
"Wondering if UOB do a summation of your funds across all your UOB accounts when considering whether it is fresh fund or the focus is just on One Account.  So if I transferred 100K out of STASH account today say 1 July to another bank  and signed up the promo to earmark 100K for One account and deposit on 31 July. The result is ""zero"" fresh fund and therefore probably don't qualify?",btohqsg
based on past months  they dun,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  are gym membership  Netflix  Telco  SP utilities and Electricity Bills all included under the UOB ONE card Cash Rebate Categories?,btohqsg
DBS WWMC for 4mpd. Calendar month cap of $1.5K  so $3K over 2 months.,btohqsg
Ya sia.Just imagine someone has $150k at start of July  enrol for $150k  then realised they need to spend $100k  now only left $50k  then now they enrol $50k.How? They withdraw during promo period leh. But then should still be eligible for their last register of $50k isn‚Äôt it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
