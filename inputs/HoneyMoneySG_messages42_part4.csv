If I try to put myself in your shoe. The short ans is yes. Using credit card instead of debit card means you can initiate a charge dispute process with the card issuer without  impacting your bank or e-wallet balance in the event of a non delivery of the online item.,btohqsg

Adding on to what I wrote ðŸ˜ŠDespite the effort to inform the cashier  misunderstandings might happen due to language issues  distracted cashier or fat finger cashier resulting you paying the purchase in your home currency (I assume is SGD). If that unfortunately happens  I wouldnotsuggest for the charge in SGD to be reversed as that action might result u to incur FX loss on top of the DCC earlier charged.For me  I would wait for the amount to be displayed on the credit card terminal. I would make sure the charged amount is not in SGD before handing over or tapping my card.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  no. As far as I know   no card regards Grab top up as an eligible spend for rewards purposes.,btohqsg

https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-nxtcard.pdfSection 5  maybe its talking about the extended installment then,btohqsg
Just read into details on 5.6I believe there is a charge. But more of an administrative charge. Currently im holding on to the cashflo card (basically prev gen of NXT)Wondering if it applies more towards getting that amount cleared off,btohqsg
Looking for instarem referral. Anyone? TIA!,btohqsg
I think where the charge will come in is under this conditionBuy item a for 500 - split to 3 monthsYou call them to not split the charge and bill as a whole. Then thatâ€™s where the admin charge will kick inBut if I pay full some directly and just let the credit overflow meaning I see the bill come in but already deducted due to overflowing credit. That Iâ€™m not sure if there will be a charge.Can try with a $1 extra payment then if they charge just make noise,btohqsg
