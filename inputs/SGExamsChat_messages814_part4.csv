is usual for my fam lol,btohqsg
My AA rm is far fr the classrooms where others take their exams,btohqsg
from kl to penang not so far,btohqsg
No i mean if no exams  then AA for what?,btohqsg
Occasional tests and like 1 exam that over liao,btohqsg
Which is why AA ain't rlly impt for my course tbh,btohqsg
and the latest is the soviet union fr,btohqsg
U dox yourself also I mean it ain't your exact location,btohqsg
Been a long time since my clock synced to the ITE calendar,btohqsg
but my sis start next mon,btohqsg
Nice means u gonna intern soon rite if July..,btohqsg
i'll be in sch  no pay but got holiday,btohqsg
Waa that one damn shag ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Oh there are 2 types of internship depending on ur luck?,btohqsg
luck  is whether the company call u down for internship and whether u pass the interview,btohqsg
but got some company the look at grades,btohqsg
Ngl I feel the ones that look at grades are usually the government,btohqsg
They even want to see your PSLE ass well,btohqsg
and they are also the ones that take the longest in terms of application reviewing,btohqsg
Private usually they have their own unique assessment,btohqsg
they always ask for it bc that's like the standard application but whether the specific organisation looks at it is up to them,btohqsg
The line between government and private is kinda blur in SG,btohqsg
i think it somewhat depends on demand also,btohqsg
Like they vary a lot for private,btohqsg
we will never know companies process...just go in with an open mind,btohqsg
ITE intern matching kinda diff tho,btohqsg
Government they are usually standardized like what Si Yan says,btohqsg
It's more of a employer initiated process,btohqsg
But at the end of the day it really depends on the department,btohqsg
even their portal is shared among all government agencies,btohqsg
Then again the amt they pay is like 400-600,btohqsg
u mean employer finds u? not the other way?,btohqsg
If you are invited to the interview  it means you pass the screening of resume round,btohqsg
Then after that it is more of like behavioral assessment,btohqsg
Basically they submit the names into the system then it matches you if I remember correctly,btohqsg
I saw my friends intern matching and it was a wheel,btohqsg
my father told me that his old boss while choosing a employee would always look at their status of education. their thinking is knowing how rigourous or challenging it is to get a degree and would be thinking if said worker was to be put in something as challenging  would he/she be able to overcome this event.A degree gave confidence to the boss that is at least signifies that this person has accomplished it before  whether anot he is able to replicate that accomplishment is another thing. But in hindsight for someone that dont have a degree  the confidence is not even there to began with that he/she could overcome this event,btohqsg
Honestly speaking it depends on people to people,btohqsg
For those that want results spanning across different points of your life..its to gauge the cosistency of the person they are hiring,btohqsg
there are people who can talk well and smoke their way into a job but cannot work in the end,btohqsg
You submit it into the system,btohqsg
again it's just part of the standardised application but they usually won't care,btohqsg
I feel that the era now is they look at degree + intern/PT/project experience etc,btohqsg
I feel that one is legit not as important,btohqsg
you have to rmb as a boss...its either you hire a good employee that brings in more money for your company or hire a bad one that looses money for your company.,btohqsg
depends on the nature of the job,btohqsg
Leadership is usually more of a behavioral thing,btohqsg
Internship + FYP project relevance is more important tbh,btohqsg
And fresh grads won't usually be in the leadership roles,btohqsg
when applying for a*star stuff i got to final rounds of interview so that one only cared about undergrad level,btohqsg
