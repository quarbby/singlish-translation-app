I think the restaurants are using multi platforms  they will choose the cheapest platform first  follow by expensive one  that why we are just waiting and waiting for order  right?,btohqsg
Market too small or just too many competitors? lol,btohqsg

Hi. Im new to lala. Any part time driver doing this. May i know a rough income for part timers,btohqsg
From my experience as I‚Äôm part time it‚Äôs hard to hit 100 dollars a day unless you drive 8 hours and or camp in town area fighting for jobs  just treat this platform as a form of pocket money to tide you through a season  definitely not a career option in my opinion,btohqsg
Probably 50-70 dollars a day part time,btohqsg
Cash on delivery means need to collect money from customer?,btohqsg
Just now got customer want scam. Put the address in the building column. üòÇ,btohqsg
