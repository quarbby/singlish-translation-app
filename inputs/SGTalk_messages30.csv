#AsiaOne#SingaporeSingapore Poly and NIE students  NSF among 11 new unlinked Covid-19 community casesMay 18  2021 at 08:46AMSINGAPORE - Two more students at Singapore Polytechnic (SP) have tested positive for Covid-19. The first is a 16-year-old boy who has tested positive for the B1617 variant of the virus first identified in India  while the second is a 32-year-old IT engineer enrolled as a part-time adult learner. This has prompted the polytechnic to move all lessons online for the next two weeks from Tuesday (May 18) to May 28  it said in a statement on Monday. The two cases  currently not connected  were among 11 unlinked ones reported on Monday. The others included a student at the National Institute of Education (NIE) who is also a part-time tutor  and a full-time national serviceman (NSF)  said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The NSF was last at Sungei Gedong Camp on May 14  and is currently warded at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital  said the Ministry of Defence in a statement on Monday night. He had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The two SP students' positive tests come after an 18-year-old from SP's Media  Arts and Design School tested positive last Saturday.https://ift.tt/3bwTGvsMore athttps://t.me/NewsRoomSG,btohqsg
