Any cards that will have points?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  would like to seek some advice on opening up a new savings account. I‚Äôm intending to credit my salary and place funds of $50k + getting a miles card. What would be the most ideal account to open currently? Also would it matter when I open the bank account e.g start/mid/end month to reap the benefits of the promo?,btohqsg
I'd think ocbc 360 saving acct and any miles card of your choice.,btohqsg
I tried and apparently it doesn't work for uob if payment was made for insurance via axs payment,btohqsg
Axs may be excluded all tgt,btohqsg
Hmm means I need to pay directly ?,btohqsg
Yeshttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/tnc-cts.pdf40.11 and 40.12.d for your reference,btohqsg
Yea please don't use axs if you want to qualify for any bonuses. Use your card directly to pay the insurance.,btohqsg
Hello  can I check if I use Amaze+Citi Rewards Card in Malaysia (purchase at a physical store)  still can get the 10X points?,btohqsg
Yes subject to same MCC rules,btohqsg
UOB One with min. spend $500.,btohqsg
I think it also depends if you are linking it to any savings account like uob one or ocbc 360.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone experience issues paying for hotels thru Marriott app with dbs wwmc ? Cant make payment. Any advice ?,btohqsg
If I use Apple Pay for online shopping on shopee does it counted as online shopping/offline? I‚Äôm referring Maybank fnf card,btohqsg
It says processed by internet and processed by respective merchant as online txn,btohqsg
Oh because of some restrictions my wechat pay got blocked. Wanted to ask how's the experience like using the card directly. I've asked the merchants and they accept so trying to anticipate beforehand.,btohqsg
Is it for the first 15k users who sign up in-app or complete the $300 spend?,btohqsg
Hi experts  does UOB PPV give 4 mpd on SIA flight tickets? I‚Äôm choosing between DWWMC or UOB PPV  and it seems UOB PPV covers more such as mobile contactless payment,btohqsg
The last line is very clear,btohqsg

Hey guys  for bank-side credit card sign up rewards  need to apply/do anything (like for singsaver etc) before spending the specified amount to be eligible?For context  I got approved maybank fnf late Nov  and have plans to spend the minimum 1.3k by Dec. Wondering if need do anything else to be eligible  or they will just contact me,btohqsg
Hi  is citi rewards + amaze still a good combination to use in SG give that the 1% domestic fee on SGD transactions,btohqsg
I actually have dbs yuu and is it better that I use that to accumulate miles?,btohqsg
Hello! May I ask for OCBC365 card  do we need to spend min.$800 to clock the cashback or any amount will do?,btohqsg
To enjoy the above cashback  you need to spend a minimum of S$800 based on posted transactions in a calendar month. If you spend less than S$800  a flat 0.25% cashback is awarded.,btohqsg
no 1% fee if clock below 1k in calendar month,btohqsg
Yes need spend 800$ eligible spend to get the cashback,btohqsg
yes if u have close to 600 spending on yuu merchants,btohqsg
I use dbs yuu sometime ago then cancel after one year,btohqsg
If you normally shop in yuu merchants then ok  my house area doesn't has giant  only fair price so trust card better for me,btohqsg
That sucks. Same situation was for me too and i find cs quite overpriced and giant quality isnt good enough for my groceries. Luckily my fp and gojek clock over $600 per month. Sadly it isnt over 1.2k either  so i couldnt get 2 yuu cards.,btohqsg
