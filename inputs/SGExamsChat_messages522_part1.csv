Half the things you expect would safe you don‚Äôt work,btohqsg
there used to be a bar within my faculty building,btohqsg
then some drunk ass pulled the emergency shower in the middle of the night,btohqsg
Bruh some guy went in there before eoy practical and swapped out a acid solution for water,btohqsg
Luckily my friend was smart enough to realise he got water and not acid,btohqsg
I only ever had idiots trigger the emergency eye wash :/,btohqsg
Looks like a sink with 2 holes u put your eye there for 5 mins If exposed to chemicals,btohqsg
bro i remember during combined biology practical class i accidentally turned on the bunsen burner with the test tube having ethanol inside üíÄ,btohqsg
I rmb back in my school  the locks of doors were never working,btohqsg
So when everyone was waiting for ‚ÄúCCA‚Äù‚Ä¶ppl be chilling in the presumably ‚Äúlocked‚Äù classrooms,btohqsg
and then there's someone chilling in the science labs,btohqsg
or if the d&t workshop doors werent locked then maybe in that place too,btohqsg
Yea  cause they don‚Äôt want students to do hanky panky,btohqsg
That is the most common occurrence for a empty classroom,btohqsg
Chairs and tables can be used to cause damage injured someone,btohqsg
yes like throwing it on someone,btohqsg
It's mainly cuz no supervision and 16 year old don't go well,btohqsg
Because the windows of classrooms are tall af,btohqsg
And the only visuals of most classrooms are only through a small open window,btohqsg
my sec sch classroom windows were like really tall lol,btohqsg
A lot of shit can be hidden and done in classrooms,btohqsg
especially in my schools computer labs,btohqsg
Once wanted to go to an empty classroom to study went into one and saw 2 students doing some heavy petting and just noped out,btohqsg
Bruh even my school Did not allow a teacher to stay in. The classroom to mark papers,btohqsg
In poly the youngest is 16 what that's why,btohqsg
I saw with my own eyes the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù walked in and told the teacher to leave,btohqsg
yep if you haven't passed 17 birthday yet,btohqsg
Oh yea you know rp‚Äôs got those corner seats right?,btohqsg
At the end of the corridors,btohqsg

I used to have lunch there,btohqsg
Last yr a couple was caught there,btohqsg
But I also saw some shit there before,btohqsg
like pda as in just kiss or legit do that shit,btohqsg
‚ÄúLegit‚Äù from what I heard then everybody rushed out from the classes on the level to see,btohqsg
There's a 5-6pm curfew when the cleaners start chasing ppl out of the classrooms,btohqsg
They were caught by the ‚Äúblack shirts‚Äù,btohqsg

They were doing the deed from what I heard,btohqsg

Amateur.. lemme give them a hint the handicap toliet is always empty,btohqsg

Then 5 mins later the other leave,btohqsg
i went to sports complex handicapped toilet before,btohqsg

Nah I know  but the ones I‚Äôve seen always got a bodyguard,btohqsg
Outside the handicap toilet so most likely not doing the deed inside,btohqsg
