No... sad to say most CC do not give cashback for Insurance payment  same go to all taxes payment except UOB Amex..  yet insurance merchants do not accept payment from Amex ðŸ˜‘ no luck at all.,btohqsg
Should I put all my saving in Fullerton fund ?,btohqsg
Never put all your savings Into one fund,btohqsg
dont put all your eggs in one basket,btohqsg
"Gotta wait for the next ""grabpay""",btohqsg
Never put your savings outside of savings in the first place lol. Savings is savings  investment is investment. Split the pie when you budget  keep what's needed as your emergency fund as an emergency fund  the remaining for your investment or whatever.,btohqsg
I thought Singapore Fullerton fund 0% risk ?,btohqsg
And only for card  not account service,btohqsg
Dbs inbox also better  ocbc worse  uob not exist ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Donâ€™t see any taker yet ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
You missed the point. Cannot find a video by@ChrisHMSGon emergency funds but here's one from@kelvintaninvest.https://youtu.be/58snhRtmi8g,btohqsg
Do you know if the 1% cashback still applies after my 4.38 % promo ?,btohqsg
I know the 1% is for ega rewards +,btohqsg
@kelvintaninvest@ChrisHMSG  if my hsbc ega promo ends in Jul 2023  will the reward+ still continue? I mean the giro 1% cashback ?,btohqsg

curious can anyone walk in to RP - republic poly and go to the food court and buy food? even if im not a student there,btohqsg
nearly risk free doesn't mean 0% risk  on rare occasions the value of the fund may dip slightly,btohqsg
Meaning that there is possibility you will receive negative profits?,btohqsg
where got such thing as 0 risk and guaranteed returns higher than deposit rates,btohqsg
T bills risk free rate already 4%  why bother with banks?,btohqsg
There is no such thing as risk free in this world. Even banks need the SDIC insurance. If 0 risk why need deposit insurance?,btohqsg
I mean is the risk same as deposit money as saving in account?,btohqsg
Can I check does buying ShopBack e-vouchers or Favepay e-cards count as Dining Category spend under UOB Ladyâ€™s card ?,btohqsg
Can I check if nfp will enjoy 1.7% with uob absolute?,btohqsg
U should ask the person who gave you your broker's referral link ðŸ˜‚but FYI even diff banks in singapore have different risk for amounts above the SDIC.,btohqsg
Giro 1 percent still on hsbc website,btohqsg
hi can i check if the categories still need to be within when using citirewards + amaze? example: I just paid for school fees about which is about 600+ with amaze  but i dont think I got 10x points  is it because the school fee isnâ€™t within the 10x spend category?,btohqsg
education mcc is excluded in citi rewards TnC,btohqsg
ahh ok  so the transactions have to be within the spend category + online to get 10x points?,btohqsg
about the same  the risk for MMF is if everyone sells the fund all at once  it will collapse.,btohqsg
happened twice in 50 years of history,btohqsg
"bank run  there's a SDIC insurance to protect u.fund ""bank run""  nothing to save u",btohqsg
Sounds like the oil crisis or the Pound devaluation.,btohqsg
U need to check exclusion list,btohqsg
sdic can cover up to 75k for each bank if bank run,btohqsg
Just need to be not in exclusion list. Amaze already converted to online.,btohqsg
Sgd mmf fund never happen right? ðŸ˜‚ Only usd,btohqsg
How about Fullerton SGD Cash Fund? Crashed before?,btohqsg
Hello  Is anyone using DCS ultimate platinum cards?,btohqsg
So  for Singapore   Fullerton fund is the safest fund to buy ?,btohqsg
the risk is equal for all SG mmf,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the best platform to buy MMF?,btohqsg
Endowus? They got that Amundi USD MMF  not bad also,btohqsg
Anyone got use ADDX or Funding Societies ?,btohqsg
Go see the sharpe ratio of various MMF,btohqsg
Looks like amaze is going the way of grab soon.,btohqsg
true .. but i still prefer using linked credit card instead of putting money into wallet,btohqsg
I'm building an automation platform for fixed income management.  Looking to integrate to a broker API.Anyone have good suggestions for a broker with low fees on T-Bills  Gov bonds and Corporate bonds?  Prefer to support minimum SGD & USD market  even better if other markets too.,btohqsg
OK I give you the sharpe ratios. first one is Fullerton SGD Cash Fund. Second one is United SGD MMF,btohqsg
So far Fullerton always positive since incorporated?,btohqsg
