Mediazone is a anti-putinist Russian media organisationMediazone confirmed in Feb 2024  49k russian soldiers have diedZelensky confirmed in Feb 2024  31k Ukraine soldiers have died,btohqsg
My exam is in 11 hours,btohqsg
How do I find the range and domain of a function ?!,btohqsg
I believe both numbers are understated,btohqsg
Draw the graph of the functionDomain is the set of values x can takeRange is the set of values y can take,btohqsg
I mean by the numbers right now  it's alr the largest conflict with the most death toll since the Korean war,btohqsg
sometimes they are reported as civilians death to deflate the numbers,btohqsg
Either way as the number stands now  it's the largest death toll from any war in the last 40 yrs,btohqsg
both do not care as long as they emerge victorious to satisfy their ego,btohqsg
Washington times not reliable at all,btohqsg
At the end of day to both it's just statistics,btohqsg
Both intelligence organization in the US and UK came to the same conclusion,btohqsg
US and UK estimate Russia deaths is like Russia estimates Ukraine deaths,btohqsg
Sounds like US intelligence is UK,btohqsg
They took parts of what Putin have said and did maths,btohqsg
Why the fuck is there 34 pre-readings for one lesson,btohqsg
So they basically did maths to derive at the 300k mark previously  now they redid maths and has actually gotten to a number closer to half a million,btohqsg
Add up it's nearly half a million,btohqsg
Which is exactly what the maths derived,btohqsg
So actually the 100k figure was accurate,btohqsg
When I meant half a million I meant casualties not death,btohqsg
Cause this what the maths means,btohqsg
Personell I don't think it means military deaths solely,btohqsg
But the conclusions derived at casualties not death,btohqsg
WW2 Soviet Union 8 668 000 to 11 400 000,btohqsg
Cause if 500k soldiers actually died,btohqsg
WW2 Germany 4 440 000 to 5 318 000,btohqsg
But you forgot that is soviet union  that is 15 countries. Now it's just russia,btohqsg
most of the troops still from Russia part,btohqsg
The soviet.union had a population of 290 million before it broke off in Dec 1991Russia's population in 1992 was 147-148 million,btohqsg
Anyways tldr  50k+ Russian soldiers have officially died  30k+ ukraine soldiers have officially died.Most military deaths occurred between these two countries in 4 years than the US/UK/New Zealand/China/India military deaths combined in the last 40 years,btohqsg
The majority of the losses  excluding POWs  were ethnicRussians(5 756 000)  followed by ethnicUkrainians(1 377 400).,btohqsg
China and India and UK and New Zealand do not have war in last 40 years? Only USA ?,btohqsg
Yea so the safe bet would be to say just over 2/4 of the military deaths came from Russia not 3/4 adamant,btohqsg
still more than the amount of Germany,btohqsg
This military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been brutal,btohqsg
Who does New Zealand conflict with ? Australia?,btohqsg
Tbh nothing but just brings to scale of how major the Russia Ukraine war is,btohqsg
Most wars start because of unresolved differences but gets prolonged because of undiscovered benefits,btohqsg
Yea...invading parties tend to discover things in countries they invade which will more than likely prolong war  america went to the middle east for terrorism but stayed for resourcesThats why they remained after killing Osama and remained after killing baghdadi,btohqsg
went for terrorism? american military contractors are third parties?,btohqsg
"I mean look at almost every country then sent their soldier to the middle east  it's always under the guise of ""safekeeping"" if it's not safe keeping from terrorism or harm  then what they conducting safekeeping on?",btohqsg
Btw the person that started the whole fiasco in Russia Ukraine since 2014 is a guy that started off liking Putin but in the end hated him.He was jailed then arrested in russia,btohqsg
A A-Wol Russian commander that invaded Ukraine with his team without permission or order from Putin. He went in and was trapped  Putin then sent in soldiers to bail him and his team out.Later on he rallied against Putin and was arrested by Putin for extremism,btohqsg
The cause  the purpose and actually the whole war is stupid in itself.,btohqsg
Probably the dream of every alcoholic,btohqsg
Can get drunk without having to buy alcohol,btohqsg
u dun like me being online isit,btohqsg
@Iamsuperfedupwithyoulater I find your Dopplerdanger then you know,btohqsg
