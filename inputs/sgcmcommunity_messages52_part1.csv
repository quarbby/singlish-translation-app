Honda makes everything. Engine to chassis to body. All,btohqsg
When is the next carplate bidding?,btohqsg
Anyone knows roughly 245/45/R18 tyre price,btohqsg
Wah  swee.. I saw like all above 200 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Depending on which tyre you go for,btohqsg
For the carousell listings  the prices are usually generalized not specific to size,btohqsg
Can try this shop  have used them before  very reliable,btohqsg
Another way to check on sgcarmart between vendors but for offers and current price based on supply  best to call them,btohqsg
But dun do wheel alignment there. Waste money.,btohqsg
They do for free if you buy tires,btohqsg
aiya i think if they provide free then do free lor,btohqsg
if not got cheaper ones but must make sure they do properly,btohqsg
i see drivers drive straight w their steering wheel at 90° then ask me whats wrong,btohqsg
Must make sure that it's done properly,btohqsg
Not sure  never had so big tyre before. Now is p zero and drive feels okay  so something similar,btohqsg
u can go for PS4 SUV alternatively for a similar feel to P Zero,btohqsg
can try PS4 or Bridgestone Potenza Sport or F1A5 or the Continental smtg dmtg,btohqsg
all v ex la if u ask me,btohqsg
cos this guys are performance tyres,btohqsg
My friend currently running on PS4 on XF,btohqsg
alot of people say no but i feel that there is a slight drone,btohqsg
PS4 nevertheless is still a great tyre,btohqsg
if you want comfort dont go for bridgestone LOL,btohqsg
their tyre wall are notoriously stiff so the car will not be quiet and it will be very bumpy,btohqsg
P zero feels okay to me  quiet and grippy,btohqsg
PS4 quite good  if you want all season and a bit cheaper can try primacy 4  my personal experience quite good with them on saloon as well,btohqsg
Ya I had primacy 4 before  good,btohqsg
I heard alot of ppl complain P zero harden v fast and wet grip not so good,btohqsg

Even Huracan STO uses potenza sport,btohqsg
Giti tyre Singapore brand . Support local 😂👍,btohqsg
wet grip is v good which is a huge + for me,btohqsg

The wet grip decent but yeah it does harden quicker,btohqsg
Yes my customers love them but really I find they don’t last on my rickshaw too,btohqsg
Are there any W124 300E Hammers in Singapore?,btohqsg
Old brand. They may have made a new Brand called Giti,btohqsg
