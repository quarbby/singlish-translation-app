cos no one to give thanks to,btohqsg
Got an angmoh writer  she said  “every day may not be good  but there is something good in every day” no need wait for thanksgiving to give thanks,btohqsg
i have a case of the late night delulus,btohqsg
isn’t it kinda late for you anyway,btohqsg
i had to submit ms forms,btohqsg
so i loaded myself with coffee,btohqsg
and by coffee i mean koi,btohqsg
late night koi sounds good ngl,btohqsg
no one to give thanks to,btohqsg
i think i need smth to put me to sleep more than keep me up,btohqsg
"the only appropriate way to use ""ur mom""",btohqsg
Monday night: stay up do report and only sleep on train to ntuTues: sleep 8pm to noonWed: sleep 1.5 hour to finish report,btohqsg
and i’ll never use pills unless i need to,btohqsg
uhhh hard to say but writing one as a second author rn,btohqsg
im either at self doubt lake or rabbit holes meadows,btohqsg
everything someone trying to write and publish a research paper goes through,btohqsg
or someone trying to go into academia,btohqsg
si yan you got any tips for me my h2 physics is tmr,btohqsg
you can take the man away from SAF but you shall never take SAF away from the man,btohqsg
ya thats what i thought also,btohqsg
maybe i uppes to sign on,btohqsg
but real i know 1 guy who did that,btohqsg
he kena posted to CDO  down pes to get out of it then he wanna sign with SPF to become some specialist IO,btohqsg
he went NYP then NS then SIM then up pes then sign,btohqsg
i mean if you know your definitions and understand your concepts and how they relate to the equations (or just what do the equations mean physically),btohqsg
A level physics isn’t that deep,btohqsg
and i think i won't get 70/80,btohqsg
i think i'm gonna get B,btohqsg
also I heard it is because the h2 math syllabus cannot catch up if they make H2 physics tougher,btohqsg
yea i mean H2 physics is massively simple bc the math they can use is limited,btohqsg
i love it when the math has no numbers 🌚,btohqsg
my prelims phys p3 i diffrentiated 2 times for 1 mark,btohqsg
and i love it even more when the letters are not even english letters,btohqsg
but fr like if you feel lost  just step back and see what they’re asking you to find  what you need in order to find it  and how to get there from what they’ve given you,btohqsg
or explore what the info given to you can be used for,btohqsg
im more scared of bell curve honestly,btohqsg
like this is all just general exam conditions things la bc content wise you’re fine i’m sure,btohqsg
you get 80/80 for p2 also means you should target full marks for others,btohqsg
