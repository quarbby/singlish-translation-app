Yi XianIt's possible that that is how they gerrymander  as we have no way to determine that is not the case. However  the traditional method of deciding which blocks to include based on demographics like average family size  property value  family income  age of family members  and potentially race is perfectly fine.You can say that we are lying  but personally my conscience is clearJust like we cannot comfirm if yours is clear  along with the gerrymandersThis is my real name. I don't say anything in public using my real name that I cannot stand behind.@nixnay,btohqsg
WP say and prove that you are a liar.,btohqsg
@nixnayYour conscience is not clear at all. Yi Xian is also not your real name.,btohqsg
