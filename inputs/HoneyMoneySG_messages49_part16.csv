Hi i first time buying T bills. Eh this competitive bid the yield i put 10%. How does it work?,btohqsg
competitive bid is the rate you are willing to accept. say if t-bill interest rate is less than 10% as what you indicated here  you won't get the t-bill application,btohqsg
Oh. Why they want to seperate competitive and non competitive bid?,btohqsg
some people prefer to set the rate they want. if non-competitive bid means whatever rate that t-bill allocate  will be what you get,btohqsg
if say the rate is 2.5% (just a possibility)  some people might not want to get that. so they rather set the rate so if it's lower than their preferred rate  they will not bid for the t-bill,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I think i understand. Because now interest rate high  most likely people dont use competitive rate. It is when interest rate low plus people using CPF  then they want to use competitive rate.,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to check  HSBC Revolution is not supported by Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
Hi experts  just have a question here about the HSBC EGA account. Currently I have monthly deductables to be billed to the account.I understand that the month after the 4 months bonus interest rates end  the best thing to do is to take out everything and put everything back the subsequent month.But since I still have my monthly deductables  what should I do to maximise my next 4 months of bonus interests?,btohqsg
If the cut off rate is more than 10%  then you will be alloted. If not  you will not get any.,btohqsg
just deposit the deductable amounts on the day of deduction?,btohqsg
but there will be a fee if we don't keep a minimum daily balance every month right? how can I avoid that?,btohqsg
Since I am depositing money for the deductibles.,btohqsg
If u depositing on the 5th month  there will not be fall under fee assuming 4th month avg daily balance is higher than $2000Either keep $2k average daily end-of-day balance for the monthor upgrade to Premier EGA,btohqsg
Hi krisflyer members  do they have bonus month for conversion from citi credit card to krismiles. Just like Qatar avios points,btohqsg
Premier EGA does not require average daily end-of-day balance?,btohqsg
is there a site or pdf that provided this info?,btohqsg
Hi  I assume u r referring to credit card sign up promotion with a spending requirement as one of the criteria.If the customer's spending hit the promotion's eligibility criterion and subsequently the spending is converted to installment plan  the customer would be disqualified because the term and conditions generally exclude spending for installment payment plan.The customer may call and check with the bank whether he/she is  disqualifed and put up the needful appeal. Outcome subject to bank approval.,btohqsg
strange I never got charged the service fee,btohqsg
If you transfer in $15k monthly to meet the total relationship balance requirement for Premier EGA account then no Service Fee,btohqsg
