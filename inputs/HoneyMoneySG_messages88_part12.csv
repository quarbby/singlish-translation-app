In case you didn't know how Visa / MasterCard business works  they pay or offer very attractive deals to the banks to use their branding and network.So obviously Citi will recommend MasterCard now. But not that this will really impact you as much. Other than Amaze pairing,btohqsg

Hi is there other ways to close uob account other than going down to the branch?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
i think only 30K will be entitle (if the fund is transfer in from non-uob bank) for the promo since 20K is existing,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/common/terms-and-conditions-savings-promotion.pdfFunds that qualify for promotion is measured to your account's day-end balance on 31 Dec 2023,btohqsg
Only $20k will be entitled because first two tiers are $20k n $50k respectively. No $30k tier.,btohqsg
Hihi  those who got fraud transactions on their uob abs card recently  whats the status now? I got 2 fraud transactions. One is 5k. And both got posted to the card. Previously when they were pending status  already informed uob and they blocked and issue new card number. Now the 2 fraud trans are posted to the new card number. Very worried that uob will ask me to pay...,btohqsg
Similar situation. They will transfer the fraudulent transaction to the new card. And within a week or 2  they will temporarily refund the amount back to the card while they carry out their investigation.,btohqsg
Is this fraudulent transaction a recent issue for most people or just specific?,btohqsg
