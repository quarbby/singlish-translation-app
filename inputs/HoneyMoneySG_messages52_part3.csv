I can download google pay. My question is if I use google pay to scan the SGQR code  can I get the 1.7% rebate from UOB Absolute because google pay bind to UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
I have been using XNAP with UOB Evol for Hawker,btohqsg
Press the blue button ‘OTP’ and key in,btohqsg
I just applied UOB Absolute. Want to know worth or not or need to change other credit card  like AMEX?,btohqsg
I did...it says invalid..i generate a new otp and key again..again it says invalid.. my mobile app has this same issue today also,btohqsg
Do most hawker have XNAP QR?,btohqsg
I want to choose one  but not keep so many. I applied for UOB Absolute is because can get rebate from school/gov/hospital fees.,btohqsg
UOB Prvi Card have a 50 000 miles sign up bonus if you spend 1k per month for 2 months consecutive. Anyone tried using cardup to qualify for this?,btohqsg
From my personal experience I would say roughly half. Those with the SGQR will usually include XNAP or Liquidpay (former version of XNAP),btohqsg
Seems that I got the answer. I use XNAP first at hawker centre  if cannot use I then use google pay  but not sure google pay can get rebate or not. My google pay will bind UOB Absolute.,btohqsg
Google pay can use as PayNow. But PayNow doesn’t give rebate. However google pay can bind credit card.,btohqsg
You need to use paylah if you plan to pay to paynow on gpay for UOB cards.,btohqsg
PayLah and PayNow are different. Why need to use gpay? What rebate can get from PayLah? Not convenient for me to topup PayLah. PayLah only allow DBS to topup  no other method  like credit cards.,btohqsg
regarding the topup thingy  you can auto debit and set wallet balance limit to be $0.So effectively its directly debiting from/crediting to ur linked bank account.Don't have to deal with wallet balance,btohqsg
Possible to earn any rewards for paying private driving instructor lesson fee via paynow?,btohqsg
I usually don’t put money in DBS. PayLah can only link to DBS.,btohqsg
scan QR for google pay cannot be funded by credit card  can only be funded by linked DBS paylah (ocbc and scb also listed but may be buggy),btohqsg
Google pay can add credit card. And can add PayNow (any bank  not necessarily DBS  OCBC  SCB),btohqsg
iPhone can also download google pay. Use scan QR only  not for mobile contactless.,btohqsg
can add but cannot use lah,btohqsg
Credit card may not workable. But PayNow should be ok since google pay can catch my phone number.,btohqsg
Then how to scan paynow QR to get rebate?,btohqsg
scan paynow QR using google pay is funded by dbs paylah,btohqsg
paynow u added in googlepay is for receiving fund,btohqsg
If receiving fund can go to PayNow  spending fund cannot go out from PayNow?,btohqsg
DBS  OCBC  SBC are more convenient to send fund to people. Now we are talking about to scan PayNow QR at hawker centre.,btohqsg
I will try to pay a UEN by google pay. Don’t know it is an online transaction or PayNow transaction.,btohqsg
uh  paynow is has always been receiving account  bank/paylah etc. is funding account,btohqsg
What you mean by cycle?? If I top up on  10 July  I will earn 4%+++ interest on the top up for how long ?,btohqsg
I will try first. If really cannot I then use PayLah (I have to put in DBS some $).,btohqsg
I opened DBS is to withdraw USD from moomoo.,btohqsg
he sent sms to register for bonus interest in May  get bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in May to Aug as compared to Apr,btohqsg
If I send on may 30 ? I wil only get on 1st June to end of August?,btohqsg
If belong to online transaction  UOB absolute may give me some reward to pay some commercial invoice by keying in UEN.,btohqsg
cannot use credit card for this,btohqsg
technically 1 May to 31 August  but of cos only get the interest if there is incremental average daily balance in the account,btohqsg
Transfer from UOB via FAST transfer  will be top-up to paylah  ready to use with gpay.,btohqsg
btw cannot add uob absolute in any mobile wallet,btohqsg
If using DBS WWMC  ill still incur some form of FCY to earn the miles right?Cos the hotel is charging in their local currency,btohqsg
I have OCBC. So no need PayLah anymore. Thanks,btohqsg
Can add UOB absolute to google pay for online payment,btohqsg
This quarter cat didnt choose travel,btohqsg
ok  but what use case for uob absolute on googlepay online?,btohqsg
So  If I Sign-up and top up on any of the following days from 1 May to 31 August  I will receive the interest on the amount I top up from 1 May to 31 August only ?If Yes  then why not 1 May to 31 December?,btohqsg
How to know my UOB EVOL spend exceeds $600 or not? I can only see all eligible card spend exceed $500 or not.,btohqsg
Need to manually calculate by myself? Then too tedious.,btohqsg
What is the cutoff date of UOB EVOL for counting the $600 spend? Last day of the month? If not  how to change?,btohqsg
Can I use UOB Mighty FX debit card to withdraw cash like normal ATM card? If yes  then I don’t need other UOB debit card anymore  isn’t it?,btohqsg
Must I add DBS/OCBC/SCB to google pay in order to use paynow from google pay? Can I add my UOB Mighty FX debit card instead? Debit card is equivalent to bank account  isn’t it?,btohqsg
Here says if paying for goods/services by scanning QR  no need to connect bank account. Only when sending money to someone (not for goods/services)  need to add bank account.,btohqsg
