ü•≤everytime I go back my supervisor try to persuade me and my friend to work again,btohqsg
so I siam all the time,btohqsg
My friend works at a jap restaurant  12/hr  4 days per week,btohqsg
My driving lessons all start next month so dw to go look for job,btohqsg
Is important to have lessons consecutively in a week.,btohqsg
March hols end so fast tho,btohqsg
So long already I still see workers riding at the back of the pickup.,btohqsg
Yeah i feel that only a few companies bother to care abt the wellbeing of migrant workers,btohqsg
Therein lies alot of other factors at play than just leaving them there,btohqsg
Yeah but still kinda feel that safety is number 1 priority,btohqsg
They dont necessarily have a reason to,btohqsg
Have u seen the video where one of the migrant worker helped a lady take her airpods,btohqsg
some fnb usually pay more on weekends(+Fridays),btohqsg

I don't have habit to study after lecture or before lecture,btohqsg
But near test or exam on average will take 2 to 3 days to study,btohqsg
3 days is a better range  2 days kinda packed,btohqsg
very common to find above $10 also somehow,btohqsg
i feel last time q difficult to find pt jobs but now q common,btohqsg
Food delivery also technically above $10 per hour.,btohqsg
but it‚Äôs still quite decent tbh,btohqsg
depends on what you do also,btohqsg
some jobs pay less for the amount of work u do,btohqsg
but $6 is sufficient if all u do is to lepak,btohqsg
Would u wish that there is minimum wage,btohqsg
last time in year 2006  I count num of cars passing through a junction as part of statistics collection by LTA$10/hr,btohqsg
But then if have min wage,btohqsg
Everyone will just pay min wage,btohqsg
when counting at the expressway  it wasn't that easy,btohqsg
tbh if u shop around and is willing to travel somewhat $6 is still trash pay,btohqsg
that time i worked retail $7/hr it was trash,btohqsg
tbh idk if i shd be giving advice but generally try not to work jobs paying below $15/h cuz its rly rly not worth the time  like there are other better ways to make money,btohqsg
i worked starbucks for 7.50 an hour and that sucked hard,btohqsg
most pt jobs don't pay past 10-12 for base hourly rate thoo,btohqsg
however most of the higher paying jobs requires some form of certification thats easily obtainable in 2-3 days  like some examples include EMT  phlebotomy  lifeguard  kayak one star coach  or even music teaching/ academic tutoring,btohqsg
there are other options like event crews that pays 30-40/h that I did after O levels,btohqsg
it depends on whether they hiring + whether u can commit too,btohqsg
i worked $16/hr no contract but q long hours,btohqsg
Same but a Japanese buffet... It's scarring lol,btohqsg
i'm never drinking starbucks again üíÄ,btohqsg
retail and f&b really not advisable,btohqsg
daddys money very nice to spend right,btohqsg
