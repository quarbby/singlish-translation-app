Speaking of DCT  I realised that there is a Honda Fit Hybrid variant that uses a 7-speed DCT transmission. Pretty cool!,btohqsg
honda is famous for engine. that 2 liter engine already has 400 NM like my m3. m3 torque is low,btohqsg
The BMW M story  50 years onFor more than 50 years  the BMW M division has been responsible for some of the most widely celebrated cars on the road.🏆What is your favourite ///M car? Mine is the BMW E92 M3🤩➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg

b58 inline 6 win worlds best engine twice alrand is the probably one of the most tunable engine in the world,btohqsg
We have no data on honda vtec turbo reliability because those cars still relatively new right,btohqsg
Maybe will kaboom or soemthing down the road nobody knows,btohqsg
but the bmw in me just dont agree with long inline 6 engine. i dont buy it. because the engine is pushed inward to passenger cell to balance the car. and servicing working on it becomes harde,btohqsg
ehhh hondas generally quite reliable ah even the type Rs,btohqsg
so bmw resists making V engines.,btohqsg
yes generaly reliable.  you can trust it,btohqsg
