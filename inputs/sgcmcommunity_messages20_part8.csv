Autobac has promotion for 4 pcs Dunlop tyre right now till 31 May.They quoted $276/4pcs 185/65r15Dunlop SP Touring R1,btohqsg
I wonder how many cars these days still uses 15‚Äù rims. Most are 16‚Äù and above.,btohqsg
Cars like the old Honda stream  Toyota kijang Innova  etc. are using 15 inch wheels,btohqsg
Looking through sgCaramart  wondering why some available pre-owned car already has STA grade (A  B)  isn't it required by buyer normally?,btohqsg
I see. Newer cars like honda jazz already 16‚Äù üòÇ,btohqsg
15inch + tyres give much better comfort and fuel economy. No need to go BIG Wheels and low profile tyres for econoboxes.,btohqsg
But it‚Äôll not pick up most faults. Better to send to mechanic still for a detailed inspection,btohqsg
Because nowadays the fuel economy differentials between the two sizes are very minimal so only cars that are meant to be very affordable have downsized wheels for cost cutting,btohqsg
Many uses 15inchPriusNoah/voxyHyundai ionicAlot of phv and taxi on the road,btohqsg
I see  so buyer don't have to pay the fee.,btohqsg
Its done as an indicator for car condition  kind of like a Mechanic's inspection or PPI but done through STA to show that they are independent and not influenced by the seller or buyer,btohqsg
"15"" steelies are still available. 16"" sports rims are usually dealer's upgrade",btohqsg
I guess depends on the profiles too. Suv uses more rubber even if 15‚Äù,btohqsg
If listed on sgcm with the grade already you don't but with most dealers  they are open to sta inspections at buyer's cost as long as they don't have anything to hide,btohqsg
True. What is it recommended to do after the transaction or before?,btohqsg
"SUV is minimum 17"". Unless you refer to the fake SUV ""Crossovers"" lol",btohqsg
Yuppp depends on profiles too  if you have 15 inchers with 30 profile (very hard to find  but let's say you do) your comfort will be pretty horrible,btohqsg
Usuallt before the deal is closed  some dealers will allow you to send to your own mechanic for a fee you pay. If they require a deposit from you before allowing  walk away.,btohqsg
Then if everything is good  proceed to pay for the car. If negotiable  ask them to replace any wear and tear identified out of goodwill or co-pay,btohqsg
Before  since after the transaction the car is yours already. Dealer only liable to 6 month engine and gearbox warranty but you don't know how they will react to issues and if they will solve them amicably or not,btohqsg
Omg. 30 is already very harsh on 19‚Äù üòÖ,btohqsg
Some dealers also offer a short term wear and tear warranty for a week or so  within this warranty you can do a more detailed inspection and look for any issues that can be rectified and discuss with them to do so,btohqsg
Just a matter of what one wants ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Jimmy's use 15/16! But I think he was referring to full size SUVs,btohqsg
I saw somewhere they require some deposit with black and white written (mainly for STA or AAS kind of inspection since there is a grade given). Not sure how private workshop do it.,btohqsg
Ya for one case recently a friend bought a used 2017 Lexus IS. The dealer only allowed him to send to his preferred workshop aft paying a deposit of 2k,btohqsg
For those who cares Low priced performance tyres..https://www.tyrereviews.com/Tyre/Habilead/SportMax-S2000.htm,btohqsg
But some like Eurokars allowed the buyer to send to own mechanic with no deposit,btohqsg
So to me it differs from person to person,btohqsg
It really depends on the dealer. Some require deposit  some don't and will handle the inspection for you as long as you pay for it. For a private workshop  the dealer must agree to send to your workshop  usually if they agree to this  it's a good sign already,btohqsg
I thought i saw a s2k car in a glance. üòÖ,btohqsg
Will they send someone their own together for the check?,btohqsg
Depends on the dealer confidence in the unit and also how big they are. A smaller dealer will always be more apprehensive as they usually have only a few units available and wouldn't want anything to go wrong,btohqsg
Yes  you cannot take the car yourself. They will bring it around usually since it is registered under their name and their company insurance,btohqsg
I never bought 2nd hand before but these are some of the tips that I‚Äôve gathered from experienced friends who did,btohqsg
So as long know what to expect and you can score yourself a good deal,btohqsg
some is for comfort reason. thick tyre wall always give smoother ride,btohqsg
Thick tyre wall very goodI kena pothole at SLE before yishun.Never burst.7 other cars burst. At roadshoulder.I report to LTA immediately.The next day contractor called me and thanks me.Said pothole very big.,btohqsg
High profile tyres adds comfort too!,btohqsg
Yup low profile is pain !!,btohqsg
and it may not necessary be less grip.,btohqsg
My tyre profile too low when I go at higher speed very bumpy,btohqsg
F1 tyre very high profile previously on 13inch rim.Now 18inch rimüòÇ,btohqsg
Good luck to them on street circuits üòÇ,btohqsg
Tyres actually played quite a big role on grip and comfort.,btohqsg
Jeddah Corniche Circuit  Saudi Arabia.Albert Park Circuit  Australia.Miami International Autodrome  USA.Circuit de Monaco  Monaco.Baku City Circuit  Azerbaijan.Circuit Gilles Villeneuve  Canada.Marina Bay Circuit  Singapore.,btohqsg
and the controversial Las Vegas strip circuit in 2023 lol,btohqsg
WahYou're a fan?Did u bought the tickets for Singapore,btohqsg
Not a fan of F1 surprisingly. lol,btohqsg
the ticket this year is too expensive imo. Will give it a miss even though i have been to previous edition,btohqsg
