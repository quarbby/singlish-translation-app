No wife  no kids  easy to retire. Don’t service any loans and stay with parents.Only the portfolio fat  continue to grind and collect dividends every year,btohqsg
yah true.....he divorce before  give a bro a chance  maybe he can still turn his life around,btohqsg
Basically married and have kids extremely harsh in SG.  Got to keep slogging.,btohqsg
Hmmm.....this type of people will save and save n no life expecting to save enough for retirement. But  万事难料  he may not be able to spend the money save.,btohqsg
Haha . True enough . It’s okay to have that lifestyle but don’t make a sweeping statement like can retire easily .,btohqsg
And people wonder why our TFR is 1.1,btohqsg
I finally understand why ppl choose single route after I married and have kid,btohqsg
different kind of satisfaction I guess. Some like to see the smile on the children  some like to see their 7 digits portfolio,btohqsg
I opt for balance because I follow my parent foodchain type. My perspective is to get married and have kids see them grow up get married.  Complete food chain.,btohqsg
According to his calculations  he spent only $8 on food in 2017. And in 2018  he one-upped this feat by shelling out just $5.50 for the year  and only because he went on a date (he paid for his own cup of tea).,btohqsg
To see whether my eyes are playing a trick,btohqsg
means his parents sponsor his food for the rest of the year ah..,btohqsg
7 digits is the 1m kind  not say the upper tier one. Farmers in SG  can farm until 1m by mid 30s consider not bad already. Assuming just your average farmer  not those big shot kind,btohqsg
How sia..I don't see how to farm 1 million by 30,btohqsg
80k a year.. assuming start work at 24 .. also 900k,btohqsg
Everything smooth is fine. But hor. Last few yrs my partner is down with illness.  Can't work.  Problem comes Liao.,btohqsg

Harsh.  The illness is similar to. Chou. Chu ming type.,btohqsg
Pay raise  bonus etc maybe can hit 100+ PA in your 30sBut I see their lifestyle really Is saving type  go home eat home cooked meals  lunch time no buy drink eat caipng. Holidays also seldom go  if go also nearby countries,btohqsg
So must Dare Dare eat Liao. Dun save on CAI png,btohqsg
I see my cousin's 30+ also don't have 80k after bonus,btohqsg
