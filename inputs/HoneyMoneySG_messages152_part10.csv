Advice for chocolate finance.Never put 50k into chocolate finance cos they will deduct interest claiming its performing lower leading to negative return. So if you put 50k  anything higher than that will deduct negative return so overall return can reduce to 2.2 percent. Advise is put less than 49k as max and leave the 1k gap to cover the interest rate so that there is no negative returns. Remember to draw out the interest ensuring that the total deposit must not exceed 50k in order not to have negative returns. Now returns is 3.3 percent for 20k and 3 percent for 30k now.  With T bills at 3.04 percent  the money is better locked into T bills versus negative returns.  Note the 3.3 percent principal is also not protected. As such with 0.3 percent premium  this risk is not worth it. That‚Äôs my view.,btohqsg
I'd say putting max 19.9k so you have the flexibility to withdraw anytime,btohqsg
Max you can withdraw is 20k per day.,btohqsg

Is chocolate finance debit card giving 2 miles for AXS payment?,btohqsg
Don't kanchiong leh the 2 mpd only starts next week,btohqsg
If I use Citi SMRT Card to buy NTUC gift card or voucher  Does it count as minimum spanding? and get 4.7% cash back?,btohqsg
Any thought on this? Worth it?,btohqsg
There are already cases of people paying and asking why they didn‚Äôt get the 2 mpd now ü§£,btohqsg
8% haircut but not 27$ conversion fee. Worth it if you want to top a very small amount. Else  not good deal.,btohqsg
Saw there isn‚Äôt any conversion fee,btohqsg
Transfer via kris+ is free but 8% loss of miles vs transfer via citi is with 27$ fee but no loss of miles.,btohqsg
Thought by transferring you got an additional 8% more miles into Kris+,btohqsg
No. By default  transferring via kris+ incurs 15% loss of miles. This promo makes it 8% loss instead. You can check in the app urself.,btohqsg
very common misconception since nobody would except a loss of 15% by transferring miles into Kris+typical GOTCHA!,btohqsg
Hello May I check if using Atome as payment for Citi Rewards Card via instarem card. Does this qualify the 4mpd?,btohqsg
actually groceries mcc also can  need not online,btohqsg
Paying for Atome using Amaze+CRMC = yes  4mpd,btohqsg
Hi All  have anyone use CRMC to pay for atome installment before? Will bonus point applicable from here?,btohqsg
Direct CRMC abit risky  use with Amaze safer,btohqsg
What about recurring bill like spaylater   netflix  spotify? Will i still need to use amaze or direct crmc is still subject to the bonus point?,btohqsg
