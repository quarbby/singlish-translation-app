I've not posted into the 1M65 telegram channel 1st coz i want to get some feedback 1st,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  also  your youtube video about Gemini now charging nothing for USD/Stablecoin trades...While it's good  but we still cant fiat off-ramp sgd as there is only BTC/ETH -SGD pairs,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  can you review my CPF strategy? It's in response to your recent video where u clarified about RSTU-SA reserved vs unreserved funds. Thanks,btohqsg
@Matcha_Green_T  I already responded. you can start from here,btohqsg
slight mismatch in your strategy - you intend to work and invest your oa from 55-65  which means you wont get to withdraw your srs tax free from 62-65 as you will be having income,btohqsg
at least not up to 40k  depending on your income then,btohqsg
Oh ya u are right.Thanks so much.Meaning to say that my strategy works only if I don‚Äôt get income from salary from 62-65. But since I am working  then if I withdraw from SRS  that would put me in a much higher income tax bracket and I sure will kena more income tax.üôè,btohqsg
Another thing to consider. There is a risk of we will be in era of high inflation period for the next 5 years. Like what it does in 1970s. So think your strategy as well. Of course this is my views. Not necessary will happen,btohqsg
just my two-cents  we are all aiming for financial independence. my strategy is to stop working for money as early as i can as we can never finish amassing money. im sure we dont want to work till 65 if we can. retire early and we can all enjoy life,btohqsg
i feel that 65 is too late an age for me  by then not sure how healthy. i think 55 would be a good age  still can travel and enjoyüòÅ,btohqsg
^ purely my thoughts  no hate,btohqsg
Depends on Yr age and spending level. Actually if u spend minimum  only basic needs like food etc. Spend like 1k the most. And earns income above 3. 5k per month. With normal increment. One only need to work 15 years to reach financial freedom if invest properly.,btohqsg
my projected age is assuming my investments do well also haha,btohqsg
of course everyone earnings and spending is different. but all of our goal is the same. can only achieve through good planning,btohqsg
if no planning  every month earn 20k also not enough,btohqsg
But at least he ‰∫´Âèóa lot.  I kind of Ëã¶Ë°åÂÉß„ÄÇ,btohqsg
my plan is to make use of the gradual increase in cpf contribution till age 55 then retire after thatüòÖ,btohqsg

cpf pays out at 65 bro  not 55. From 55-65 how?,btohqsg
Y u HSBC!!... How u know i don't have foldable bike  apple watch and money?? !!,btohqsg
if everything goes well  i should be able to survive from 55-65üòÅ,btohqsg
investments is the plan  then withdrawals above frs/brs with property is my back up plan,btohqsg
i am late to the investment game... only started in my early 30s so have to set aside more monthly just to keep up. wasted many valuable years of compounding,btohqsg
If early 30s is consider late then I super late liao.,btohqsg
haha as usual my belief is dont compare cos always someone better than you. im earlier than you but alot of people earlier than me. as long as everyone reaches finish line good already,btohqsg
anyway because of this new policy  we will get a huge boost to our sa from 50-55. hopefully by then the frs amount not too ridiculous so that the excess will be meaningful,btohqsg
if got 600k in ra which is good by today's standard but if frs is 500k when 55 then headache,btohqsg
but then again the boost will most likely be channeled to oa for bros/sis that hit frs,btohqsg

Hi  i applied DBS woman‚Äôs card (blue) and got approved  (first time CC holder for DBS)  any idea when is the best time to apply for the woman‚Äôs gold color card?,btohqsg

if u are eligible for gold  no need use the blue. the point only half,btohqsg
Any Airbnb promo for first time user/hacks for Airbnb spending?,btohqsg
45-50 will be better if you can - then you can still tahan some form of budget travel and experience more countries. In 60s you will start to feel like staying in luxury hotels with club lounges travelling on business class if you can afford it.  Best to plan retirement and financials based on this luxurious style of travel in 60s but if you can tahan then travel budget or a combination of both,btohqsg
Thanks guys and@ChrisHMSG!! I just applied even the blue card is not arrived yet  and the approval is so instant.. now i can use the gold color woman‚Äôs card..,btohqsg
need the index to continue with the 10+% annualised growth for next 20 years then can 50 yearsüòÅ,btohqsg
Hi- which credit card was mentioned as secret card for lounge access pls  at the end of the video ?,btohqsg
Not sure abt other credit card.crypto.comcro prepaid visa card is good for lounge access but must stake $5000 in their cro crypto coin,btohqsg
iirc  its the boc zodiac card but the offer has ended 2021,btohqsg
i agree that thecrypto.comcard is good  offers unlimited lounge access but comes with 5k commitment/investment in CRO which has to be staked for 6 months consistently,btohqsg
realistically  2x miles card like altitude and citi miles offering a total of 4x entry should be more than enough for commoners like myself... cant even travel that many times,btohqsg
but after getting slightly into the miles game  really inefficient for clocking miles,btohqsg
Guys how to book non Sq flights with krisflyer miles ?,btohqsg
Just go to star alliance website,btohqsg
U can use SQ website to redeem the ticket for star alliance ticket,btohqsg
