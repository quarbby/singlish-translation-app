"""exploring something new"" more like propaganda for ss",btohqsg
The issue is that the second SEQ question in history requires you to actually understand the topic,btohqsg
Like unless if you can whack all the possible essays memorizing alone wonâ€™t really work,btohqsg
Memorize in a strategic manner not word for word,btohqsg
Like link up the different events n interrelation between the characters,btohqsg
And memorize the underlying factors beneath them,btohqsg
U can draw out these interrelation of events n characters in diagram form to internalize,btohqsg
So when u reurgitate during exam it would not be like u rewriting the whole text book,btohqsg
It will expedite u to a higher level mark range too,btohqsg
So in a way preparation work is required during revision. Linking up these is essentially preparatory work,btohqsg
Reminding me of last year not taking o levels,btohqsg
Singpass can tell you your exam grades?,btohqsg
Luckily I don't have the singpass app,btohqsg
By the way  anyone has experience with or know how to close your singpass account? I don't want to use it anymore,btohqsg
wow you can check your grades,btohqsg
That's unfortunate. I don't even have online banking and still survive. I regret singing up...,btohqsg
Hmm but singpass allows u to check other things as well,btohqsg
Such as ur cpf savings  workskill future credit... etc,btohqsg
Otherwise u have to go down to respective counters physically when u need them,btohqsg
U need these documents that can be retrieved online when u apply for jobs  or apply for bank loans  housing loans... and etc occasions,btohqsg
Thanks for the explanationI have $0 CPF and don't intend to ever work or live in Singapore...I don't mind going down physically,btohqsg
Partially it's also because I currently use the token and they will discontinue it... I can't use the sms option as I live overseas and they insist on a singapore number. I'm concerned about the app as I could lose my phone...,btohqsg
Ya i can see.. that u preparing to detach urself from these.. hahaAnyway which country do u have in mind?,btohqsg
In the future? Probably UK for my PhD.,btohqsg
I do get stuff done  suprisingly without an online bank account...,btohqsg
Oh dear. U have a few fears. Hmmm. Why dont u sign a contractless line? Like zero1 charges you $9.90 per month for 1st 6 months  unlimted data,btohqsg
I am using a prepaid sim. I only have a smartphone because my JC forced me to...,btohqsg
Thats nice. So u go to bank branch? Meanwhile i am curious  what sort of transaction do u do? Without online bank account,btohqsg
Mathematics. I am super lousy at everything else. So so at mathematics,btohqsg
Wow thats interesting. During my time jc dun encourage us to have phone,btohqsg
Oh. Then ure specialized in that alr. All the best man! Very few ppl around us specialize in maths but for that few who do  they are very passionate about it,btohqsg
Yes. I don't have an ATM card also so I only have passbook. Need to withdraw at counter...,btohqsg
Because they have whatsapp group chat and what not and I hate it but what can I do? I used to have a nokia phone,btohqsg
Why not US? I heard US is a much better place to do PhD compared to UK.,btohqsg
Oh ok so u do withdrawal lah. Not like checking of fx rates or telegraphic transfers.,btohqsg
Thank you very much Tiffany! What do you do usually?,btohqsg
Oh. Omg how i wish it existed during my time,btohqsg
My interest is very broad and general. I read up on everything every industry and get my hands on everythign,btohqsg
I just like the UK. I interact much better with British people. I can't really talk to Americans easily,btohqsg
Thats kind of true. Uk ppl r a bit more traditional is it,btohqsg
Hahaha. All the best in your future endeavours too!,btohqsg
Not really. Americans joke and party and laugh a lot,btohqsg
Probably in terms of overall quality,btohqsg
Thx so much !! Well if u ever reside in uk do let me know. Cos if i go there i can pop by ur city haha,btohqsg
In terms of mathematics  maybe Princeton? I'm not sure what the top US unis are in terms of mathematics,btohqsg
Oh. Well then their CDMs are not common ðŸ™ƒ so u have to deposit cash over counter. But their app is good. UOB app always lag but UOB has many CDMs around the place ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Bro really sounded like a boomer ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yes yes thisAmericans r way more liberal n wildUk r systematic n traditional.,btohqsg
Ya. China suddenly advance so fast. Like suddenly really,btohqsg
But i look up to them,btohqsg
