honestly if u can do well in ur SBQ,btohqsg
ur sbq is quite saved alr,btohqsg
Only tip for SS last minute is that during the exam u write notes beside the question and jot down all sorts of possible interpretations u can have and then pick the best.,btohqsg
I would say tackle the paper with common sense but I realised what I think make sense may not to the marker,btohqsg
Should have but not everyone would,btohqsg
Sec sch with covid is disturbing,btohqsg
Stating a personal experience so I can assure others that it works. I got C6 for chinese and failed H1 CL. Are you happy that I said that now?,btohqsg
Bottom line is  itâ€™s more important to be pragmatic and work smart especially if there are constraints like time because you want to maximise your marks. Maybe my method of studying wonâ€™t work but the message is the same  focus on areas which would likely benefit you more for each unit of time you study as it really helped for me. For my case spending the same amount of time memorising elect geog as compared to SS would help improve my combined humans results more more since imo geog requires more memorisation,btohqsg
Some stuff required practice like math and chem,btohqsg
Some need understanding or memorisation like bio,btohqsg
Yes like math u wonâ€™t memorise and blindly memorising Chem wonâ€™t get u much,btohqsg
Some need you to learn a skill,btohqsg
Once you know how to argue and get L3 you got it,btohqsg
Yeah not forgetting to mention thereâ€™s 16 marks of essays for geog. SS sbq doesnâ€™t need memo besides the format which is pretty easy,btohqsg
And the 4 marks part in section B no resource as well,btohqsg
But regardless I think this applies for all subjects. study smart so you can maximise your marks in exams,btohqsg
I am at the last stretch and procrastinating alot,btohqsg
get out of telegram you don't make a difference here so you are completely useless here,btohqsg
If you not gonna study  others will  they'll do btr than u and u'll be lost u want that ah,btohqsg
Also I shld @ myself tbh.,btohqsg
U see if u dun study ur useless. U need to study otherwise next time you'll be working for me and I'll be mean to h,btohqsg
u want more choices in courses in JAE?,btohqsg
U gotta have good results man,btohqsg
if u @ urself everyone will follow suit meaning that ur arguement is invalid,btohqsg
mans went straight for the kill,btohqsg
U happy with ur prelims result meh,btohqsg
Not happy then must study to improve right,btohqsg
Don't be a lazy fucker on your chair staring at your phone. Ur parents out there fucking working for u to rant on telegram,btohqsg
cmon bro i don't even know you well  stop being a dick to everyone here and get the f outta here no one cares about you here so just leave,btohqsg
Don't be all talk no action,btohqsg
btw sorry for asking this weird question  since im a train fetish nerd but  have any of yall had that time where the exact same train is stalking you?,btohqsg
Fcking masochist asking for personal attacks,btohqsg

Bullet train is good cuz penetratoon is smooth,btohqsg

China making a train with wings,btohqsg
