Whos ready to say bye to their A1,btohqsg
k value 1/8 for the integration of x(something)^5/3 anyone?,btohqsg
ok no i put 121 LOL,btohqsg
Your answer is probably still closer than mine,btohqsg
gg for the paper alr lol,btohqsg
Still have no idea what I did wrong,btohqsg
bruh i changed 8 million to 8 000 000,btohqsg
Omg no wonder why I got like 2500+ for the year LMFAO,btohqsg
Hopefully I can still get one method mark,btohqsg
I can say goodbye to A1,btohqsg
Say hi to c5 for me,btohqsg
BOO TO PAP! *Slams desk*thank you fellow singaporeans!,btohqsg
Which question did you find it hard?,btohqsg
i cldnt do the x-coordinate of D at all lol f but i cld derive its 1 frm the eqn la üò≠,btohqsg
Is there qns paper out or not yet?,btohqsg
Well we should be able to get 1 method mark,btohqsg
anyone have the soft copy of the paper?,btohqsg
2 if the markers are nice,btohqsg
Yeah he got his wish fulfilled,btohqsg
isnt it 25k at the denominator,btohqsg
I guess the easiest question by far for paper 2 was the simultaneous eqn,btohqsg
It felt out of place for this rly hard paper,btohqsg
the last part abit confused tho,btohqsg
Ok I guess that one is easy as well but simultaneous eqn is probably still easier,btohqsg
Like even a P5 student should be able to do it,btohqsg
11 marks for area of region???,btohqsg
Need to find equation of line,btohqsg
I got f'(x) = 0 lol,btohqsg
No but the question said the normal = 1/2 or something,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even have In2 in my answer at all,btohqsg
Gradient should be f'(x) = 0 no?,btohqsg
Tbh  can sense a lot of frustration in the exam room jn,btohqsg
Same I only got ln 1/2,btohqsg
But still can't get higher that a b3,btohqsg
How was the paper u all?,btohqsg
i did exactly the same but i got 0.065,btohqsg
Easy game for u right  Yao Teck,btohqsg
How on earth did u get this though?,btohqsg
i find the c aft that,btohqsg
isnt itx = 0 when its full,btohqsg
then wont - 9pix/25k be 0,btohqsg
isnt x the height of the space,btohqsg
I put the explanation for integration,btohqsg
25 - 25 = 0 no??,btohqsg
That the graph is above the y axis,btohqsg
x = 0 that means its still full what,btohqsg
not worse than me can liao,btohqsg
Got people only do 2 questions in the entire paper,btohqsg
Don't need to call bedok alrd,btohqsg
so i lost 20 marks gg for me üòê,btohqsg
