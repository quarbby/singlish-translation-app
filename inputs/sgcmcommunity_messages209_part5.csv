Looks good to me  same taillights as carnival hybrid,btohqsg
But definitely some people won't like,btohqsg
Lower half  I don't mind but the upper half looking like a fastback not really,btohqsg
Is this based on the Avante CN7 platform?,btohqsg
Online says it is diff platform  CL4,btohqsg
No turbo leh .. if have I will be good,btohqsg

implement ERP 2.0 then remove COE,btohqsg
Remove COE .. is Sipeh idea bro,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt worry Abang ..  he want be come Ho Chi Minh City ü§£,btohqsg
But w erp 2.0 and coe  it shud regulate,btohqsg
COE shld flat rate.Cat A 100kCat B 150kOpen $175Then ballot system,btohqsg
To secure a ballot  min 50% down,btohqsg
Then extend frm 10yrs to 15yrs and no renewal,btohqsg
If sell before 10yrs pay penalty. Then next car COE pay additional 10%,btohqsg
Must secure COE before going showroom,btohqsg

See all this scammers see until sian,btohqsg
Hi All  I see that Audi A3 is also around 14k depre. What do you all think of it? Higher fc and maintenance?,btohqsg
No point comparing FCs in normal petrol car. 10km/l vs 12km/l the difference is minimal. Unless you are vs hybrid.Conti always have much better drive feel vs jdm or kdm at the same level. They also have a more premium outlook and interior vs jdm2 main downsides:A3 will be squeezy if you need to fit a 5th passenger in the 2nd row.Maintenance cost will be slightly higher at 1-2k more per year.,btohqsg
For the 2nd row  A3 is the smallest among the few?,btohqsg
I test drive civic and A3  went for the civic T,btohqsg
A3 is just basic of the basics,btohqsg
Cant even compare to entry A Class Sedan and 2 Series,btohqsg
Even a Avante CN7 beats the A3,btohqsg
Audi A3 just riding on the ‚Äòpremium‚Äô brand,btohqsg
Can't imagine there are locals conspiring with foreigners to scam locals,btohqsg
but civic is cvt. cvt is shitüòÇ,btohqsg
116 A3 A160 all in the same cat,btohqsg
Comfort = A160. Drive = 116. A3 is mixed of both,btohqsg
116 is fwd platform wont get any better drive,btohqsg
if really need to choose between the BBA,btohqsg
Anyway just go test drive all and have a feel ba,btohqsg
If its old car. Jdm also plenty to repair. Suspension alone for jdm already 1k+ liao. So don think toyota or honda are worry free. Wear n tear parts are unavoidable. Only consolation is that they are cheaper,btohqsg
JDM kdm Vs conti....conti go hospital more often spare parts also more x,btohqsg
Ok la experience ma. Don own where got experience to tell,btohqsg
Want brand want satki  A3 lor,btohqsg
If want value for money and practicality and nicer than A3  go for Avante CN7,btohqsg
116 f20 still rwd. F40 fwd,btohqsg
But a3 such a shit car. Shit interior shit look,btohqsg
Audi wor some bro said Audi is a more atas VW version,btohqsg
If you have $$ test drive all the car you want and go for the one you like the most (comfort/looks etc)If you have budget then go for korea/jap car bcos end of the day is only point A to B.,btohqsg
Go hospital I also pay to drive....my baby,btohqsg
Golf is good choice for small families,btohqsg
Thanks all for ur inputs üôè,btohqsg
Bro end of the day it‚Äôs your $$  you wanna spend on what you control. Other people opinion is not important bcos you are the one own the car and see the car everyday,btohqsg
My company also have a staff deal for kia Niro plus with dec 2023 reg  little mileage (drives from vessel to kia warehouse and routine lta inspection)  4 years warranty or 160k  1.5% interest. But I don't like the look leh,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt like then move on  go test drive everything you have in mind and get a feel,btohqsg
Life‚Äôs too short to drive a car that you don‚Äôt like ü§£,btohqsg
