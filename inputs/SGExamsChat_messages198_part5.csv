florida got a lot of electoral votes,btohqsg
WI is turning from red to blue,btohqsg
There are a lot of mail-ins not counted yet,btohqsg
wi is not a key state,btohqsg
i’m talking about the four states i mentioned,btohqsg
Why are you talking about the decided ones,btohqsg
texas and florida residents can ask trump for help the next time they experience disasters,btohqsg
bc the rest are “too early to say.”,btohqsg
i just want to know who wins,btohqsg
But i dont want him win,btohqsg
Likely will go to court though,btohqsg
Biden wouldn't do much himself. As delusional as trump is  he gets more done. I'm pro trump haha,btohqsg
i feel like people who support biden are more anti-trump instead of pro-biden,btohqsg
they don’t have a better choice,btohqsg
Honestly I'm pretty indifferent to it  but I like watching reactions,btohqsg
if im an american citizen i’d vote for biden simply bc im anti-trump,btohqsg
The middle east stuff I guess,btohqsg
That's what democracy is about xD,btohqsg
he did not make usa a safer place,btohqsg
thank you i don’t live in usa anyway,btohqsg
america basically fuck it self over,btohqsg
don’t have to care much about this,btohqsg
thru all the crying and protest,btohqsg
i think chinese people would rather trump win,btohqsg
since biden winning wouldn’t help us-china ties,btohqsg
"got a lot of ppl i know vote for trump just to ""piss off liberals and feminazis""",btohqsg
which is think is stupid as hell,btohqsg
Penn still has a ton of mail-ins not counted yet,btohqsg
china would prefer to see usa to he in chaos,btohqsg
and they wonder why their country is like that,btohqsg
voting for people like kanye is dumb as well,btohqsg
yeah my china friend say vote trump cuz they wanna see usa go down,btohqsg
a vote for kanye = a vote for trump thh,btohqsg
the elections are a movie and we’re just viewers,btohqsg
when BLM happened my china friends damn happy  grab popcorn celebrate,btohqsg
prob gonna have more chaos if trump wins,btohqsg
mmm bad to think that way but yeah normal,btohqsg
if he loses it’ll probably be chaotic,btohqsg
idk if he can admit defeat,btohqsg
i think both ways america gg,btohqsg
which is gud cuz i no liek murica,btohqsg
they do a lot of fucked up shit then claim russia chna middle east worst then them when they're the same,btohqsg
some say japan may be more in favour towards china as compared to usa even,btohqsg
Biden will never flip other states,btohqsg
hong kong protests but they themselves..,btohqsg
im sorry but usa is a fucking mess,btohqsg
americans dont care about what foreigners think tho,btohqsg
why would anyone side w usa now,btohqsg
"jn i was arguing w some murican they say ""gay marriage illegal ur country suck""",btohqsg
im like LOL look at your own country,btohqsg
