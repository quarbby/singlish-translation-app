if you SBF and you dont want the remaining houses  they have a % where lets say left like 10% or 5% of the units and you can reject and have the non selection count being waived,btohqsg

hihi  can i check is there any way to see what documents iâ€™ve submitted on mydoc@hdb? during my selection day  i had missed out some docs  so i uploaded them online and received an acknowledgement sms 3 days later .Then recently  i was mailed another copy of a declaration form for cpf authorisation to fill up. I have submitted that before the deadline and i screenshotted the default acknowledgement page on the website. However  i did not receive an acknowledgement sms this time round and it has been a week.lowkey worried that they didnâ€™t receive it and my flat will be forfeited ðŸ¥² it is a good uniti alr went to the efeedback but havenâ€™t heard from them yettldr: is there any way to check what docs i have submitted online,btohqsg
Various bugs encountered at the  preliminary HFE. Couldn't progress on after filling up the employment and income.,btohqsg
