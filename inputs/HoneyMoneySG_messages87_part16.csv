Giro on 25th. Haven't receive yet,btohqsg
Its online got to print it out,btohqsg
Giro on 24th. Haven't received yet.,btohqsg
I checked before  Citibank got no business reply for payment services. If have please share.,btohqsg
GIRO on 22nd received 23rd  GIRO on 24th not received yet,btohqsg
Did they process it? This is for Item Processing department,btohqsg
They rejected due to incorrect info. Just send in 1 more the other day,btohqsg
I guess they did end up processing your GIRO form? Considering that they can tell you that got incorrect info,btohqsg
i find before - but the PO no is also diffso  to confirm earlier,btohqsg
Ya lor.. the postal also different  if they want to be zekark they just throw your letter sia,btohqsg
#SCBDP#DPok latest update from my RMit seems SCB is tightening their Credit Card annual fee waiver criteria.No more Priority Banking customer = automatic/easy credit card fee waiverOne human of mine with $100k in SCB because of Bonus Saver did not get Bonus Saver credit card fee waiver. We had to appeal through the RM and needed 3 Manager level of approvals (WHAT THE HECK).RM updated if the account is fully funded with $200k cash  it MIGHT have been easier but once again no commitment there.not too happy with SCB.,btohqsg
For the rising dragon promo  register first or deposit fund first?,btohqsg
i'm quite happy with scb...they had a very good NTB promo one year ago. 8% on $500k + 4.3% on $1m for six months + $9k cash bonus,btohqsg
yeah i did this too one year ago!so far no priority bank has even come close to this fabulous promo,btohqsg
Register first.. make sure you get the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (there is no CONFIRMATION EMAIL) first  before u fund it  but don't wait last minute.,btohqsg
then why are you unhappy? a relationship should be long term and not transactional. both sides win...:),btohqsg
errr. no... when i signed up for priority banking  it was made known to me that no minimum balances will apply and no credit card annual fees (except premium cards) will apply,btohqsg
if i apply SC Simply Cash Card today  but approval only in Feb  will i still eligible for the $330 cashback?,btohqsg
Then you are delulu.. the bank is always happy  they will never lose. You have to do what it takes for you to be on par with them,btohqsg
Singsaver can apply OCBC and SCB card same day? Will rewards stack or there is a cool down period for next one?,btohqsg
Not even the same bank.. lol but you can try  the banks will probably think you're sus for applying for cards in different banks in the same day,btohqsg
Just a $30k Bonus Saver credit card. $218 annual fee.,btohqsg
I had UOB absolute credit card.I had signed up American Express true CASHBACK card for the singsaver promo. And I counted as new to bank offer???,btohqsg
2 different banks.. lol granted AMEX is not a bank in SG,btohqsg
Because under American express official website  UOB absolute cashback card is inside.,btohqsg
If you tap physical Amaze card linked with citi bank rewards overseas/local fnb  does it count towards the rewards?,btohqsg
Yes  thatâ€™s what Amaze is for.,btohqsg
can.. but it will affect your credit score. better to space out the applications (apply each in different months at least),btohqsg
Does topping up Grabpay with UOB debit card add up to the UOB one account $500 spending?,btohqsg
Why I just bought $30 000 of T-bills againhttps://youtu.be/QrWavXS0WyM,btohqsg
Did you read the whole TNC?,btohqsg
6540/6051usually  but both excluded anyway ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi all. With global market situation on interest cut   and bond yield start to increase is investing in Singapore savings bonds still a sensible choice ?,btohqsg
Depends on what is your stage of life  risk tolerance and market outlook,btohqsg
Do you know how to use XNAP w Amaze on ios?,btohqsg
Amaze cannot be added into Apple Wallet so no way to use.,btohqsg
yes because u lock in the promised rate for 10 years when u bought it,btohqsg
Agreed. I hope it wonâ€™t drop much next round,btohqsg
Hello experts  Iâ€™m trying to register with priority pass with citipremier miles Mastercard on the Citibank app.The instructions say find the referral code on the bottom of the app  but I canâ€™t find it anywhere?Does anyone know where is it by chance?,btohqsg
Need to wait a bout 2 weeks then it appears after card approval.,btohqsg
I have my card for about 2 months already :/,btohqsg
So I was quite shocked it didnâ€™t appear  tried to call them but theyâ€™re close now.I guess I have to head to the lounge another time,btohqsg
I believed the peak is past us,btohqsg
Have to scroll at the bottom of your Citi app. Or look for Get More,btohqsg
yes need to fiddle around its on the app. i also had this problem cannot find last time,btohqsg
Then just contact Citi.all the best,btohqsg
sounds like he is travelling by tonight and cant wait,btohqsg
But citi rewards can be used thru XNAP to trigger online transaction right,btohqsg
What are the chances of UOB offering credit card sign up promo without the first xxx nonsense condition,btohqsg
I think it's nerfed.. last time yes  but I just tried XNAP with Citi Rewards last Friday at Hawker Center.. no more 10x points.. chatted with Citi Support  they confirmed it is not eligible for 10x points anymore..,btohqsg
