if need to cut just cut lor. Keep waiting end up the price drop lower and lower... Very painful but the cash you get back can be used elsewhere to possibly generate returns = reduce the losses from that painful cut.I made a lot of mistakes. Always cut only when almost bottom. All the lost opp costs. My losses think need more than few decades to recoup liao. But I keep telling myself still have a lifetime ahead to trade to better the game and make back.,btohqsg
