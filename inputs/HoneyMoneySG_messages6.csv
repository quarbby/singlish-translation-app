I don't think Everything Money is Buffett style 😅,btohqsg
Sounds like click bait for more views for himself,btohqsg
They have a software that allows you to get the historical financial data and work out price for different growth rates  free cash flow  etc and they recommend to use an annualized return of 12.5% because if you get 10% u might as well just invest in S&P500 over long periods of time like 10years.. their basis is buffett style value investing but we can always agree to disagree. No problem ya…,btohqsg
Yup I know about that software. My point is that Buffett doesn't invest like that. You can watch the following 4 minutes interview where Buffett explained why he invested in Apple. He didn't mention anything about the historical financial data  growth rates  free cash flow  etc. He paid a lot attention to the moat and the quality of the business  which isn't the case for Everything Moneyhttps://youtu.be/m4hMh-Jugf4,btohqsg
Check Berkshire purchase few years back. They bought a lot of Apple shares. I feel like I miss a few millions 😂,btohqsg
They first bought $1 billion in 2016 (decision made by one of the lieutenants)  then after Buffett is convinced Berkshire raised their stake to 5.6% of Apple  worth $161 billion. The total cost of investment is $31 billion,btohqsg

Hi guysMany of u say the FX rates for Amaze/ Revolut are better than most of the local bank exchange rate.Is it viable to transfer my fund from TD Ameritrade back to my bank account in USD.Top up Revolut/Amaze in USD. Convert to SGD  then transfer back to my bank account.Do it make sense?,btohqsg
Usually when you transfer USD into lpcal bank account there will be charges so it doesn't make sense.Use revolut because it can top up by grabpay and also 20% transport cashbackUse amaze because no fx fee and 1% additional cashback,btohqsg
Anyone able to deposit or withdraw fiat currency from Revolut to FTX or CDC? Thanks,btohqsg
My intention is to transfer my cash holding from my TD Ameritrade. Is there any way to do it?,btohqsg
Actually do a lot msia shops take master card? With msia opening up  it might be good to sign up amaze card and spend over there.,btohqsg
I didn't know you could tip up using grabpay to revolut,btohqsg
Not a TDA user  lets see if any one else has comments,btohqsg
Yes  quite a lot especially restaurants  saloons and big stores. Similar to Singapore actually where small shops tend not a accept but big shops do accept,btohqsg
My memory of travelling to Malaysia is 24 months ago so pretty sure things have amped up since the pandemic,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone tried having using their grabcard as authorized CC for regular insurance premiums? Am assuming it'll work like normal CCs  just need to have enough balance on deduction day right?,btohqsg
grabcard is a debit card  doesnt work with insurers!,btohqsg
Ah right... That's ok  just gotta work a little harder and pay manually through AXS then haha thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Few days ago  I just paid an insurance  premiums via eAXS n using GPMC,btohqsg
yeah correct ^ can use grabpay card to pay via axs but not to link it with insurers directly. sorry should have been clearer on that!,btohqsg
Anyway  i've only a small mind....,btohqsg
It's okay  sometimes we tend to fluctuate from one mind to another because of emotions too,btohqsg
Just not be a jerk to anyone,btohqsg
Revolut transport cashback campaign has been extended to 30 Jun 2022,btohqsg
wondering if they're going to extend it forever🤣,btohqsg
Hi guys  which broker is best for buying HK stocks? I cant decide between tiger and moomoo,btohqsg
Actually the difference is small if you don’t trade frequently  so just choose the one you find more comfortable to use,btohqsg
Will be drafting a broker cost review for HK next week,btohqsg
Between Tiger and Moomoo have not much difference  they are always competing with each other,btohqsg
Boss sharing the IBKR charge. Let me know if this is appropriate?,btohqsg
The fee across different platform still confuse me catch no ball 🤣,btohqsg
Yeah this is good info. In short for IBKR  just go tiered unless you're a big investor,btohqsg
How much invest is consider big investor?,btohqsg
I provided some Personal Finance insights through Planner Bee. Even though I'm sad that they did not use my microphone audio but still  some relevant stuff that I always share on my channel. [NOT SPONSORED]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R27T58bExHM,btohqsg
Lol. Instaram changing the cashback 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze NERF Apr 1  2022 onwards- Min Spend $1500 per quarter to qualify- Only transactions above $10 will be eligible for cashback- Cashback reduced to 0.5% for SGD purchases. Foreign purchases remain at 1%,btohqsg
Unlucky  i just got the card,btohqsg
Well at least still can use in Malaysia and maximize our SGD,btohqsg
Still better than nothing. It’s quite good for overseas transactions due to reduced conversion cost,btohqsg
Hello  can I check if topping up grabpay will contribute to the min $500 spend?,btohqsg
Don’t think so. Only 2 cards count grabpay topup as eligible spends - UOB absolute and Amex true cash back from what I remember.,btohqsg
Yup I have the AMEX true cashback card,btohqsg
If you dont see a common group  then it is definitely not me,btohqsg
And I don't have an official crypto chat group,btohqsg
If you already have the true cashback card then the new signup promo for Krisflyer blue wouldn't apply to you,btohqsg
I signed up during the recent ipad air promotion! But just received the card recently  thats why I'm checking if topping up grabpay using true cashback card will contribute,btohqsg
Make a minimum charge of S$500 on eligible spend within the first (1) monthof Card approval. Spend made by Supplementary Card Member(s) will beconsidered in the total spending of Basic Card Account.For non-eligible spend  please visitamex.co/SGexclusionsfor a full list ofnon-eligible purchases or transactions  which is non-exhaustive and is subjectto changes from time to time.#singsaver#amex,btohqsg
The short answer is  if the credit card does not exclude it from its rewards (miles/cashback)  then Singsaver will qualify it as eligible spend,btohqsg
Hi Chris! Is there a good way to transfer crypto fromcrypto.comto hodlnaut without so much gas fees?,btohqsg
Try find a coin that can transfer via other networks (instead of ERC20) to FTX Blockfolio. Then Blockfolio to Hodlnaut is free,btohqsg
Thanks Chris! I will take a look at FTX and FTX blockfolio.,btohqsg
U can transfer like >> CDC to ftx Blockfolio then >> hodlnaut.I have tried both usdc & ETH,btohqsg
Use BSC(Binance smart chain) for CDC to Ftx Blockfolio,btohqsg
is it possible to deposit sgd to CDC or must deposit USD same like in FTX. Sorry not familoar with CDC,btohqsg
You need a straitsx account - previously known as xfers. Then you can deposit sing dollars to buy certain tokens. Cro  ETH  BTC  USDC  USDT. I think,btohqsg
May I know what's the fees like?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows the best way to topup cpf now? Since grab won’t work now right,btohqsg
hi chris  can check do u dca $100 every week to goog / googl and is it at every mon of the week?,btohqsg
For the syfe  for the first deposit need to deposit $1k? If I deposit $1 to try out then $999 next  is it not able to receive the $60?,btohqsg
Add on.. is it $100 sgd or us?,btohqsg
Need $1000 sgd for first deposit,btohqsg
Guess I will not get the $60,btohqsg
BTW how long for the withdrawal?,btohqsg
Around 2 work days for syfe,btohqsg
I see.. thanks.. almost like tiger withdraw,btohqsg
Anyone knows why A35 drops so much recently?🤯,btohqsg
Bond price and interest rate are inversely related,btohqsg
if interest rates rise  investors will no longer prefer the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond  resulting in a decline in its price.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if your eligible to get miles/cashback for topping up credits in lalamove?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGor anyone have use VISA card fromCrypto.com(with $5k stake of their CRO for 180days? Isn't this like a fixed deposit?) to access airport lounge without any issue?,btohqsg
is anyone using hugo? any reviews?,btohqsg
Hugo card is really nice and it kinda work the same as revolut but without the exchange rate. Good to set budget on the card as well and has the vault and investing gold option like Revolut.,btohqsg
Tracks your spending pretty well too,btohqsg
Can top up Hugo card using credit card ?,btohqsg
Poem not very intuitive with selling stock using SRS. cant even find the button lol,btohqsg
Yes  you are placing your faith in CRO value in exchange for those benefits. CRO may fluctuate wildly which is a risk u are taking when you place $5000 worth,btohqsg
Thanks. Which card or benefit you signup withCrypto.com?,btohqsg
I have not try using credit card but if i am not wrong  only bank transfer work at the moment.,btohqsg
Additional benefit of the indigo/jade card is that weekly u get passive Cro as payout for staking the 5k,btohqsg
So as what@ChrisHMSGmentioned if u are bullish & strongly believe incrypto.com. Then would recommend the jade/indigo card.Otherwise the ruby is still good when compared to other debit/creditcards. As the 2% cashback for ruby has no other requirements other than just staking for the card.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if your eligible to get miles/cashback for topping up credits in lalamove?,btohqsg
No idea  i only use cash for lalamove,btohqsg
Most of the time i use GrabExpress after buying their subscription plan,btohqsg
Which crypto platform has the lowest fees.,btohqsg
I'm using coinhako.Buy in 1%Sell out 1%,btohqsg
Gemini charge 0.4% both buy and sell ?,btohqsg
For active trader via web. 0.35%,btohqsg
Anyone know how to remit earnings in FTX to POSB?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGthanks bro for sharing how to make SRS fund work harder. Just nice catch the S27 uptrend window. My sitting for 2 years not working haha,btohqsg
Only dilemma now is RSTU/VCMA or SRS,btohqsg
From posb to Gemini how long does the wire transfer duration,btohqsg
I did VCMA  RSTU  SRS in this order,btohqsg
SG time 2pm deposit  10pm appear in Gemini,btohqsg
Is this correct sending to GeminiThe branch and clearing code empty,btohqsg
Correct. Try small amount first to confirm,btohqsg
Yes yes will try Send $10,btohqsg
If ok than will proceed to fund.,btohqsg

anyone used revolut card in malaysia? hows the exchange rate like for sgd --> myr on revolut and are there any fees?,btohqsg
Used before Covid  no Fees  i used to be Metal Card User,btohqsg
I don't think there's any additional fee unless you withdraw from a bank but from my experience there are some apps and some stall which the card couldn't get through.,btohqsg
Today’s rate today  is 3.10 to 1 SGD  the fees are for Fund Transfer,btohqsg
Up to S$350 per month  no fees for withdrawal,btohqsg
Do you guys invest in the silver and gold on revolut?,btohqsg
i invested $100 for fun haha,btohqsg
For use in Malaysia  there are 3 fees: Currency  Weekend and Foreign Transfer.Currency - Standard plan has a 5k limit per month  Metal is unlimited. Anything more  you need to pay a fee for that amount converted. This limit applies to all currencies  eg USD  EUR and resets at the start of each month.Weekend - Revolut charges a fee if transactions are done during weekends  between 5pm on Friday to 6pm on Sunday ET Time (currently GMT -4  which if converted becomes 5am on Saturday to 6am on Monday). Applies to both Standard and Metal plans.Foreign Transfer - if you are remitting money  Standard Plan charges 0.3% if you are on Standard and remitting MYR  up to a cap of SGD 9 (SGD 3K transfer). Metal has free transfers.Cash withdrawal - you can withdraw 350 SGD equivalent in foreign currency on standard per month  1050 SGD equivalent on metal. Fees are imposed for withdrawals greater than the limits. Weekend charges also apply if you withdraw during weekends on London Time,btohqsg
Above dun apply for Card Spending right,btohqsg
I'm not sure about this  as I've been using Revolut for international transfers. Not sure if card spending counts towards the 5k limit  but I think weekend fee applies if you are transacting outside of weekdays in London time.(Note that the weekend fee is not explicit  it is baked into the exchange rate),btohqsg
Exact fee breakdown for the same transfer  without the weekend surcharge exchange rate will bump up to 3.0905 (~0.3% spread from the foreign transfer fee for standard users),btohqsg
Any idea how to identify which ATM to withdraw money from at MY?,btohqsg
There used to be a list done up to see which banks do not charge a withdrawal fee for international customers when withdrawing funds  but it has not been updated for quite a long time (maybe COVID?)https://www.dropbox.com/s/ajifjmncdazhzm6/Revolut_FreeATM.xlsxAs of 2018  the list says that BSN Bank  CIMB Bank and Maybank can be withdrawn from  and to avoid RHB Bank. I think Maybank itself should provide enough ATMs since they are widespread in the country.One important thing to choose while using foreign ATMs is to choose the option of charging in local currency (i.e.  charging your cash withdrawal in MYR). Some ATMs will offer you the option of letting the ATM Bank do the conversion for you  defeating the purpose of Revolut since you will be charged that bank's exchange rate with a spread (typically 3% or more).,btohqsg
Good discussion over Revolut. I will have a video tomorrow discussing about this. Stay tuned!,btohqsg
Thanks  appreciate it! Useful guide especially when the international travel is starting,btohqsg
Hi community  what do you think of this?,btohqsg
There's no exchange rate like Revolut.,btohqsg
automatic as in the investment part,btohqsg
Anyone did a comparison of syfe equity 100 and VOO which give better returns,btohqsg

Hi Chris For withdrawal of up to $350 overseas  does the top-up have to be by bank transfer  and not credit card?,btohqsg
I'm referring to ur latest video on revolut.,btohqsg
It's not like Grab where they distinguish bank or CC funds,btohqsg
I see. Looks like a small loophole for a 'cash advance' :),btohqsg
"Well if you consider that you need to be physically overseas and the limit is so low  there is really not much incentive to ""monetize"" it",btohqsg
May i ask whats the best card for usage if overseas especially Malaysia? Currently using InstaRam for transaction in Malaysia (petrol etc etc...) any better deal? reccomendation? looking for a good exchange rate since for rm to sgd and also since instaram rrquired min spend of 1.5k to earn the cashback  am looking for other good deal. thanks,btohqsg
Take note instarem recent has a nerfed. Do read them out,btohqsg
Watched this and apply instaram through the link there,btohqsg
btw instaram helpdesk is good. always reply promptly,btohqsg
If i was traveling  then i would use citi cashback with instarem link (8+0.5%  with no fx fee). 8% petrol  8% groceries  6% restaurant  $800 min spend. If not enough then come back Singapore and top up NTUC Gift card,btohqsg
Hi Chris  Is there any guides available to sign up for priority pass membership using the DBS altitude card?,btohqsg
Currently I'm paying my insurance and investment from GE and AXA using GIRO. Can I use AMEX TCB to earn cashback?,btohqsg
How to transfer UOB kayhian CPF money back to CPFOA?,btohqsg
You can top up your Grab wallet with your TCB card. And pay using your Grab master card via AXS.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGCan Revolute be added to AXS for payment ❓,btohqsg
Awesome  so I just need to make monthly reminder to do my payment on time.,btohqsg
I'm using this method for insurance and town council fee. Both of these do not qualify as spending for most credit cards,btohqsg
I don't pay town council fee. But on AMEX the website says insurance are eligible. But I remember I read some where that GE and AXA don't take AMEX card. So hopefully can try to find some answer here.,btohqsg
But Grabpay and AXS combination works as well.,btohqsg

Hi  not sure if anyone has encountered the same prob as me. Have tried to top up $100 to the revolut account via bank transfer but it will auto link to Google pay using my credit card instead. Is that normal?,btohqsg
Just get the bank account number in revolut and then do a FAST transfer from your bank,btohqsg
You can walk in to any UOB bank to fill up a form or you just let the money there for 2 months  they will auto transfer back to your OA account. This is what the CS told me when I called them last month.,btohqsg

apparently cdc dont support xsgd purchases for alot of cryptos  only 8 are able to,btohqsg
so it you are a diehard cdc fan you have to buy into any of this 8  then trade them for ada which will incur huge spread,btohqsg

Yeah man. End of the day  monies in CPF will be withdrawn or return to us. It is only a matter of when and whether are you able to access to it. Go ahead to top up as much as you can. Once you hit the cap  you know you are already there and can focus on other platform.,btohqsg

55 years old. You will receive letter from cpf 6 months before you turn 55. Magic number  55 year old withdraw  65 year old start cpf life. Got house  above BRS can draw out. No house  above FRS can draw out. Just like this  no need to be confused.,btohqsg
Thanks ser.This is helpful…But what if my parents only have 30k at the time of 55 years old?Say they are 60 years old now  is there still any way I can help them top up to unlock BRS or FRS?I am thinking if there is a limit topup or issit too late.,btohqsg

Over the weekend  I received a question from a viewer seeking my opinion on whether his CPF strategy is good. Usually I don't take up such requests because it is personal finance advice (which I am not qualified to give) and secondly  it takes up my time to think and respond.Nevertheless  I try not to give personal advice 1:1 as I want to benefit everyone instead of a personal advice  and also I am not your financial consultant. But since  he/she has taken the time to write a long input  I took some time to read it and give my comments on that in this group,btohqsg
Aim:1) Before 55; to hit FRS.RSTU-SA $8K/year for 5yrs = $40k. Subsequently  stop RSTU since RSTU $ is reserved for RA and cannot be used for investment and will serve to meet the $40k minimum SA needed before excess SA above $40k can be used for investments.Hit BHS so that excess mandatory contributions above BHS flows into SA and yearly MA interests above BHS flows into SA.Keep 1st $20k in OA to earn 3.5%; base 2.5% + bonuses 1%. Excess OA above $20k invest into Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 and/or OA-to-SA transfer.End result  my SA will have only $40k worth of reserved RSTU SA top-ups while the rest of the funds in my SA is unreserved and can be used for shielding.My response: The thought process is correct  but optimally is less than $40K because of the compound interest effect. In fact  if you're age 30  only need S$16K at 30 to compound to $40K at age 55,btohqsg
2) At 54yrs 11 mths; shield SA  meet FRS (BRS + Housing pledge)Keep minimum $40k in SA (made out of my reserved RSTU anyways); invest the rest into Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund  1 mth before turning 55.Liquidate just enough Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 back to OA to meet BRS. Remaining amount to meet FRS can be met with housing pledge.My response: CPF SA shielding understanding is correct. You either hit BRS or FRS  but it's only important when you want to withdraw money out of CPF (above the FRS or BRS).,btohqsg
3) At 55; wait for RA to be formed and let CPF do it's thing. Doesn't matter if never hit FRS 'coz hitting FRS only unlocks ability to withdraw funds above it  if I don't intent to withdraw  then it's alright.My RA would have met FRS i.e. 2x BRS where (BRS made out of $40k SA and remaining from OA) + BRS shortfall met with housing pledge.My OA would be $0 with the rest shielded in Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500.My SA would be $0 with the rest shielded in Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund.My response: Yes  correct.,btohqsg
4) 1mth after 55; resetting my CPF OA & SA.Unshield SA funds in Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund back into SA to earn interest.Unshield $20k from Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 back to OA to meet the minimum $20K requirement for investing.My response: Correct. but don't have to wait 1 month. Can do it immediately after your RA is formed (Birthday),btohqsg
"That's all for now. This viewer has several strategies after age 55. But I do not want to discuss that because:1) To me  this age is very far away and policies/strategy has to adapt and change over time2) It involves something called ""Double Shielding"" which is beyond my knowledge and understanding.I'll let this viewer ask the question to the group if he/she still needs the answer. But I guess CPF is very complicated and my understanding for now is sufficient from Step 1-4. In future when I'm reaching that age (long long later)  then we can discuss more.",btohqsg
Now got 1 app called ugift  they giving out free $5 grabfood voucher for new signups,btohqsg
But becareful if you share their referral code  it shows your hp no.,btohqsg
just my take on cpf shielding  we never know when/if this hack will ever be removed. if it does  it will cause a whole shift in our plans. thus  i do not want to put much emphasis on this for *my own* planning,btohqsg
they may close off this loophole to save the 1.5% as more and more people are learning about it - just a thought,btohqsg
no worries  CPF rules will always change.It use to be after 55  both OA and SA can be withdrawn in sequence  now u can only start withdrawal from SA followed by OA because the SA interest rate is higher.,btohqsg

Hi  I did a lum sum CPA OA to endowes investment  it went well. And the other day I did another 1 time investment from my OA into the same goal. But I was charged $3.61 for access fee.,btohqsg
Do anyone know what is happening?,btohqsg
Looking to invest my SRS fund. Any recommendation which platform charges lowest fee?,btohqsg
Access fee is what Endowus charges you quarterly. The usual $2.14 or $2.68 is CPF-IS Bank fee,btohqsg
So how do I pay them?,btohqsg
How is the Endowus Access Fee paid for?CPF/SRS are charged in the following order:If you have available access fee credits  we will first deduct the fee amount from your access fee credits.For the remaining payable access fees  we will charge the fees by redeeming from your investment holdings.https://endowus.com/support/360000515273-what-is-the-endowus-access-fee-how-is-the-endowus-access-fee-calculated-and-paid-for#h_01F77WBVJKF0Q9601WGRV9Y62D,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSG  can you review my CPF strategy? It's in response to your recent video where u clarified about RSTU-SA reserved vs unreserved funds. Thanks,btohqsg
@Matcha_Green_T  I already responded. you can start from here,btohqsg
slight mismatch in your strategy - you intend to work and invest your oa from 55-65  which means you wont get to withdraw your srs tax free from 62-65 as you will be having income,btohqsg
at least not up to 40k  depending on your income then,btohqsg
Oh ya u are right.Thanks so much.Meaning to say that my strategy works only if I don’t get income from salary from 62-65. But since I am working  then if I withdraw from SRS  that would put me in a much higher income tax bracket and I sure will kena more income tax.🙏,btohqsg
Another thing to consider. There is a risk of we will be in era of high inflation period for the next 5 years. Like what it does in 1970s. So think your strategy as well. Of course this is my views. Not necessary will happen,btohqsg
just my two-cents  we are all aiming for financial independence. my strategy is to stop working for money as early as i can as we can never finish amassing money. im sure we dont want to work till 65 if we can. retire early and we can all enjoy life,btohqsg
i feel that 65 is too late an age for me  by then not sure how healthy. i think 55 would be a good age  still can travel and enjoy😁,btohqsg
^ purely my thoughts  no hate,btohqsg
Depends on Yr age and spending level. Actually if u spend minimum  only basic needs like food etc. Spend like 1k the most. And earns income above 3. 5k per month. With normal increment. One only need to work 15 years to reach financial freedom if invest properly.,btohqsg
my projected age is assuming my investments do well also haha,btohqsg
of course everyone earnings and spending is different. but all of our goal is the same. can only achieve through good planning,btohqsg
if no planning  every month earn 20k also not enough,btohqsg
But at least he 享受a lot.  I kind of 苦行僧。,btohqsg
my plan is to make use of the gradual increase in cpf contribution till age 55 then retire after that😅,btohqsg

investments is the plan  then withdrawals above frs/brs with property is my back up plan,btohqsg
i am late to the investment game... only started in my early 30s so have to set aside more monthly just to keep up. wasted many valuable years of compounding,btohqsg
If early 30s is consider late then I super late liao.,btohqsg
haha as usual my belief is dont compare cos always someone better than you. im earlier than you but alot of people earlier than me. as long as everyone reaches finish line good already,btohqsg
anyway because of this new policy  we will get a huge boost to our sa from 50-55. hopefully by then the frs amount not too ridiculous so that the excess will be meaningful,btohqsg
if got 600k in ra which is good by today's standard but if frs is 500k when 55 then headache,btohqsg
but then again the boost will most likely be channeled to oa for bros/sis that hit frs,btohqsg

Hi folks  after vcma 8k  any other ways to hit BHS?,btohqsg
if your annual cpf contribution less than 37740  can contribute up to this amount which will split between oa sa ma,btohqsg
this method no tax relief btw,btohqsg
actually i think  if your concern is not about tax relief and just want to achieve bhs  you can just topup to the limit within same year just that tax relief capped at 8k. this is my understanding,btohqsg
ok so:if your motive is for tax relief  8k is the max for yourself. you can either topup for family members another 8k or topup srs.if your motive is achieve bhs  you can do so no matter the shortfall just that relief capped at 8k.this should be correct,btohqsg
I should aim to max out my ma first or aim to get bhs in OA first?,btohqsg
Just for max out tax relief. Kind of no worth it if for the sake of max out go max out. Liquidity also must consider as might have some other opportunities such as investment in stocks etc.,btohqsg
Yep  roger that. I just saw  if annual limit of 37 740 is hit then the excess is refunded without interest. Question - what if I top up already  then plus the mandatory employers contribution exceeds the limit later on during the calendar year  then the refund go where?,btohqsg
your question is flawed as bhs means maxing out ma leh. oa can never be maxed out cos it gives the lowest interesy,btohqsg
Oh thanks I didn’t know thanks,btohqsg
yep bhs is basic healthcare sum so its only for medisave,btohqsg
So it means I should be doing ma follow by OA,btohqsg
whats your intention? the only way to topup oa is to do vc to all 3 accounts up to 37740 annually whereby 23% goes to oa if you are below 35. there is no way to topup to oa alone,btohqsg
unless you have a housing loan serviced by oa and you do voluntary housing refund which acts like a 'topup',btohqsg
I have a vauge impression that Chris once mentioned cashback cards are better than miles cards  not sure in which video  but does this still hold?,btohqsg

I did run polls but don't think i sided one camp over the other. It's really all up to your preference,btohqsg

CDC Card able to earn rebate if pay via Cardup on IRAS or insurance?,btohqsg
thanks for the useful info. Just a question. to use cardup for IRAS tax payment  do we have to adjust the payment amount at the card up platform in July when the tax payment plan is usually revised to reflect the actual tax amount? and again in Apr the following year (due to the decimal difference)?,btohqsg
just to clarify  if we want to use the axs method for iras tax payment  we can still apply for monthly payment through giro first? but pay through axs monthly before the giro kicks in?,btohqsg

Hi Chris I saw your latest video on cpf I dont get it  if you Rstu 192 000 to FRs and dont work a day more  SA all RSTU  how do you withdraw it all at 55?,btohqsg
Depends on whether you prefer to earn cashback or buy miles at a lower cost,btohqsg
short answer is yes. long answer is you need to meet UOB One requirements  watch my video on that,btohqsg
I only mentioned you can withdraw amounts above FRS.,btohqsg

Thanks  I watched the video on the recommedation of UOB One card with Cardup and wants to know more on the requirement as the cashback is paid based on tier and on quarterly instead of monthly  right? If April paid $2000 on iras  then May 500 ntuc and June 1k Petrol and ntuc  is it meeting the requirement for the cashback 5% and/or 10% (5% for base and additional 5% for selected merchant)?,btohqsg
I won't risk it as I assume it doesn't work that way,btohqsg
Based on the lowest tier  not highest. Hence $500 tier,btohqsg

hopefully someone else can help you cuz I am just a cryptoboi. I only play s&p500 with cpf and thats why i subscribed to chris,btohqsg
Crypto.comhave FAST but if you transfer SGD in  you still need to convert to USD or USDT then can buy some coin that are not SGD supported  right? Pluscrypto.comSGD to USD rate is also not exactly the best  right?That's why I want to see if there are any banks that don't charge any fees or charges for receiving and sending USD and where to get the best exchange rate,btohqsg

also i think the cashback is now reduced to 0.5% for sgd transactions :(,btohqsg
If you're on standard account  you should be charged international payments fee (0.3%) for both transfers. Perhaps you transferred / exchanged more than SGD 5 000 worth of currencies in this month (this also includes exchanging currencies to withdraw cash  or exchanging currencies for foreign currency txns on your Revolut card) - this results in a 1% exchange fair usage fee for any amount above SGD 5 000.,btohqsg

Hihi  new here and stumbled upon this group from the Amaze card video :)Wanted to get some insights from people who have linked Citibank Premiermiles to Amaze; my card is still currently on VISA  is there any cons of converting it to Mastercard just to pair it with Amaze?And to double confirm  so if I use Amaze overseas  CitiPM will register it as overseas spending even though Amaze will convert it into a SGD charge in the citibank bill transaction?Thanks!,btohqsg
Why use Citi PM and not Citi Rewards though?,btohqsg
I guess initial laziness as I've always been on CitiPM  and my parents' sub card is free. Citi rewards still have expiry right,btohqsg
Yeah no harm getting the CitiPm MC.Not sure for the fx conversion part. Would recommend CRMC though since 4mpd plus 5 years expiry,btohqsg
Ok i will look into it  thanks! Although I just asked customer service as well  I have to clear out all my PM miles before I change  as they won't get transfered over,btohqsg

Just keep two of them. So you have 4x priority passes per year,btohqsg
That would be 2x of the annual fees? 😅 Trying to learn from ur video advice to use put most things into one card,btohqsg
Just waive using the hotline or message. Dont have to pay for citi card fees,btohqsg
Ah i see. Not sure if i split my stuff into 2 cards whether they will deem me as low spender and don't give fee waiver. But ok let me read more into the citi reward card. Thank you!,btohqsg
shouldnt be an issue. i called up citi last year to cancel my PM and they even offered me a small retention offer of $50. catch is that i need to keep my card for another 3 years(annual fee waived for this 3 years),btohqsg
essentially free $50 just to keep their card for free,btohqsg
Oh wow ok  thanks for the tips,btohqsg
$50 for 3yrs....1 less caller to their hotline to waive fees...🤣😅,btohqsg
keep in mind that there is an on-going strategy call credit-card churning.we all know that by now that it is 100% possible to waive fees. if fail  appeal and waive again. if can't waive  cancel then reapply another card for a sign-up bonus which usually worth up to 250sgd.banks will try to bait you to keep the card with small bonus like 50 or 10x5 sgd package but if you are here to churn  don't fall for it. just cancel and come back again!just imagine how many sign up bonus you can get...google it! quite fun :),btohqsg

yea but honestly i dont want to deal with citi due to their customer service... not sure why i agreed to keep the card for this $50,btohqsg
dilemma.. citi's sign up rewards always seem to be the best compared to the rest of the banks,btohqsg
#dpocbc CS quite a tough nut to crack to waive cc AF. they see you dont spend on those cards  they also dont bother trying so in the end cancel also.,btohqsg
Same that's what i encountered with ocbc also. I nvr tried it for CitiPM cuz i get the miles from the annual fees anyway. So not sure about citi rewards,btohqsg

I see. I thought UOB absolute Amex can have 1.7% cashback for insurance and medical bill too?,btohqsg
dont tink uob directly will get,btohqsg
Not all insurers accept amex. But most insurers will accept AXS,btohqsg
How about using it to top up grab and use grab for recurring payment,btohqsg
that will be tis method ma,btohqsg
does anyone know if there is any way to use my instarem amaze card before it arrives? (apple pay  etc),btohqsg
ahhh so can’t pay through instarem app or add apple pay right?,btohqsg
then does linking Citi Rewards card to InstaRem Amaze card and using it to spend give me citi points for all spend?e.g. dining  hotel bookings  phone and netflix subscription bills  which were not considered eligible spend?,btohqsg
Not sure about apple pay cuz im not apple user haha,btohqsg
It should. It routes it as an online spend. Not so sure about subscription bills though,btohqsg
wouldn’t the usual exclusions apply? so travel related not qualified?,btohqsg
Apple Pay doesn’t support Amaze  Gpay no problem,btohqsg
Guys Amaze + dbs world woman card  if I make an offline purchase within Singapore with the amaze card I'll get the 4mpd yeah ?,btohqsg
Just to confirm this is still valid right ?,btohqsg
IS UOB Absolute the best cashback to pair eith gpmc?,btohqsg
Is there a way to enable finger print authentication for instarem android app ?,btohqsg
ok but paying for dining with instarem is counted as online food right? just that travel is not counted no matter what so whether you use instarem it doesn’t count?asking because most of my expenditure is on dining then shopping,btohqsg
Because in the instarem app settings I'm only seeing these 3 options,btohqsg
And these are the other functions offered by instarem under this tab,btohqsg
Not sure where to find the fingerprint option,btohqsg
It's at the account login page,btohqsg
I actually these options I login with  Google,btohqsg
Fingerprint should appear under settings. What phone are you using?,btohqsg
Then it may be a phone problem. Mine is a samsung and working fine,btohqsg
Nvm I'll just use the Google login,btohqsg
Quick question  if my miles are expiring say Oct 2022  does it mean I must fly before Oct or as long as I book before Oct 2022 is fine but fly in Dec 2022,btohqsg
Book by Oct 2022. But then no more refund or cancellation after that,btohqsg
Signed up with your referrer code. Is the return value better to link Amaze with DBS WWMC or UOB One or Citibank Cashback or CIMB?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc and citi rewards mc,btohqsg
UOB One is Visa. Cant link,btohqsg
Hi Chris  you mentioned in your video that you have a secret card for airport lounge access only shared in telegram. Could you advise what it is or point me to the relevant conversation? Thank you.,btohqsg
was referring to the BOC zodiac card but the lounge access has been nerfed/removed,btohqsg
Oh nooo … ok thank you very much,btohqsg
now travel open up alot of people looking for lounge card🤭,btohqsg
Precisely… sadly that one was removed,btohqsg
well  i did mention that for regular employees  normally have 2x entry level miles card should do the trick,btohqsg
cos thats a total of 4x access to lounges per year,btohqsg
plus the annual fees are waived so can just keep the cards,btohqsg
for myself i hold the citi pm and dbs altitude  waiting to be able to travel again to use them....,btohqsg
Citi Premier Miles MC 2xDBS Altitude VISA 2xIf you have Citi Premier Miles VISA  another 2xMultiplied by the number of adults that can qualify for credit cards in your household  just go apply using my link@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Ok thank you! I can hold the card but don’t use it to spend and still can access the lounge right,btohqsg
What is the criteria to be Accredited Investor for stocks in Singapore? If i just move in here,btohqsg
yup because the mile rates are bad,btohqsg
3 criterias1. income of 300k pa2. net financial assets of sgd 1mio3. net personal assets of sgd 2 mio where value of your primary residence is capped at sgd 1mio,btohqsg
btw you need to apply for priority pass after getting the card,btohqsg
the card alone doesnt give you access,btohqsg

Thank you! Citi rewards too right,btohqsg
Citi rewards bonusnot eligible for travel,btohqsg
Ok thank you! Seems DBS women world is the winner,btohqsg
Hey I am kinda lost with crypto stablecoin like USDC  USDT  etc…,btohqsg
I wonder how do crypto gurus here choose which stablecoins to investment let’s say to earn interest by staking the stablecoins?,btohqsg
USDC USDT UST BUSD are all stablecoins that serves the same purpose  = 1 USD.Just that they are built by different founders.Like your singtel starhub M1 all samesame but different.I am no guru but I like to choose what I think is the safest with high APY and that's UST.If you stake on hodlnaut its 13%. If you stake natively its 19% APY.,btohqsg
Ok can. I also only have the mindset of which one is the highest APY,btohqsg
Will explore a few platform and start my budget allocation for stablecoins staking,btohqsg
"To me  getting profit very easy one. Just buy and hodl only mah.The focus is how not to lose money hehe.You bet on a wrong asset... ggYou panic sell... ggYou bet too much on a single buy and crash... ggat the end of the day  i always ask ""how these people earn money to give us 19% sia""then i will know what to do legood luck ah",btohqsg
Agree. That’s why I just wanted to find out  beside USBC USDT for example  since it is all similar equal to USD. I wonder what’s the difference between the two. And the one I checked in Celsius  it seems both USDC and USDT interest P.A. same same~,btohqsg
I will check on the hodlnaut.,btohqsg
Recently comparing  Celsius   Nexo  and Hadlnaut from seedly post.,btohqsg
Usdc shld be more safe. There is some controversy saga on tether.,btohqsg
I read that in seedly also,btohqsg
Currently have some in crypto app  last time 12% for 3 months in earn for those with Purple/Green tier,btohqsg
"USDT is laojiao. They don't want let people audit them  so people deem it as shady. But being the laojiao then they got the first mover advantage lo. thats why you see so many people using.USDC is audited and proven to be good liao.All these are pegged to 1USD and backed by $. So naturally the APY they gave are market rate. same same one.If you wanna play DEFI one its like DAI or UST which is way higher. Cuz the founder ownself promise higher APY with their fancy protocol. All not sustainable one. But I don't really care haha  free money I just take. ""Not sustainable"" means they can't give high APY forever one. they eventually will drop to market rate. which is the same as USDC and USDT",btohqsg
Until recently announced 8% in crypto earn,btohqsg
Ok  thanks for this info. I will see how much I willing to put and still able to sleep at night,btohqsg
how strict is citi with their prestige card eligibility? anyone has any idea?,btohqsg
Hi Hi! Which credit card is best/better to use oversea? 😂,btohqsg
Well  change is the only constant. Expect CRMC to follow too,btohqsg
Usually when one door closes  another one will open,btohqsg
Keep subscribed so I can update my next opportunity,btohqsg
Ok wait for your new insights shifu,btohqsg
Hi all  other than grabpay  any other digital wallet that support UOB absolute Amex card? There’s a monthly transaction limit on grabpay. Thanks,btohqsg
sigh i only just got my CRMC and instarem amaze hasn't even arrived yet,btohqsg
Gosh how much is the grabpay monthly limit?,btohqsg
You spend more then $10 000 per month?,btohqsg
No. The limit is way less than u think. If have more than 6 transaction per day  sometime the card get locked. They say for security reason. Crap...,btohqsg
I see. What do you spend for 6 transactions a day?,btohqsg
Did not spend much. But somehow it fail to transact after 6 spends,btohqsg
Have not experienced that myself yet,btohqsg
Can card up do recurring car loan payments or I have to pay monthly after I link it to credit card?,btohqsg
So when we sell stock now will have 7% ? Deduction?,btohqsg
7% is gst on your commission charged,btohqsg
normally commission charged is low like $1+? then pay 7% on that $1+,btohqsg
Might not be a good choice to use Cdc Visa card for rental / mortgage since they limit annual spending to 30k. Any1 knows if there’s a way to increase this limit?,btohqsg
I believe is set by MAS. No one can change that,btohqsg
As young working adults we all contribute a fix amount to our parents monthly  I use bank transfer. Is there a way to that in Cardup?,btohqsg
Thx. Hope that they will raise the limit soon,btohqsg
pay it as rent? not sure if it works tho,btohqsg
You’ll need to upload your rental agreement for rents,btohqsg
just do some real spending? shouldn't be hard  go to NTUC and grab something  and that's easily $10,btohqsg
Anyone knows what’s the best card for overseas usage to accumulate points/miles?,btohqsg
For your information  I finally figured out how to connect bank accounts to Revolut. This is what I got from customer service:---Thanks for your patience  Upon checking and further review  seems like you need to set up first a Designated external account.From the app  tap Payments  scroll down to Bank accounts and Add recipient.Under the Individual tab  you will be prompted to enter details of your bank account  your name  and address. Please ensure that the name you input exactly matches with your account registered name with Revolut (you can check your Revolut account registered name in-app  under profile  settings).After you have set up your newly created recipient  you will be able to set it as your External Account using the toggle.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if cardup payment is eligible for Grab points?,btohqsg
how about order grab deliveries? 🤪,btohqsg
Hi  if I refer a friend to join Tiger  how long does it take for them to get the account ready? Takes a few days right?,btohqsg
yes  should be only one working day,btohqsg
Anyone knows what’s the best card for overseas usage to accumulate points/miles?,btohqsg
Ooh! Okay. I sign up so long already I forgot.,btohqsg
Instarem amaze with dbs wwmc (till 31 may) and CRMC,btohqsg
Can let me know where is the payment tab  I can’t find at my side,btohqsg
As a student  should i use grab card for points or should i get a student credit card?,btohqsg
Or you just try to make a transfer to your own bank account and you will be promoted,btohqsg
I scroll all the way down cannot see payment LOL,btohqsg
To earn the revolut invite referral fee  it seems like in item 3 mentioned connecting another bank account or using bank account.Top up from grabpay will not be eligible since it is not a “bank”?,btohqsg
Maybe you can make a transfer to your own bank account first,btohqsg
Take bus 20% off(Max 10$ only) and top up crypto app card,btohqsg
The yearly limit 30k does not seem enough too. So trying to find another e-wallet as a backup 😬,btohqsg
Or other than UOB Absolute and Amex True CB card  are there any Visa or Master card that give Cashback for e-wallet top up?,btohqsg
Experienced this  but the transactions were the same transaction with different amounts. Just had to perform a transaction elsewhere then it worked already.,btohqsg
The limit is 5k daily  10k monthly and 30k yearly if I’m not wrong.,btohqsg
I think someone will only do this if you might hit the maximum spending of GPMC.If not the usual method is to use AMEX to top grab then to revolut.,btohqsg
Yes  most of time I use AMEX and GrabPay to top up Revolut  but for the public transportation cashback  I have to top up from bank account once per month. So this is just to save some troubles from opening bank apps and making manual transfers,btohqsg
Especially if your bank app is buggy🤣,btohqsg
Which card got public transport rebate?,btohqsg
Revolut card has temporary promo 20% capped at $10. SC smart card has 6%. CDC depends on your tier. All these card don’t have minimum spending.,btohqsg
Thanks! I shall go look at some student credit card,btohqsg
Is it possible to pay for HDB housing loan via SGQR with GrabPay card?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  saw your cardup video. Would like to ask. If my existing payments are alr on GIRO.. do I cancel those arrangements once the cardup arrangement is up?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  for cardup withcrypto.comcard  is the CDC card considered Singapore issued card for promotions under cardup?,btohqsg
I’m not sure if cdc card will work for promotion. If u click into the details of the promotion  it’s indicated they debit card is not applicable,btohqsg
If anybody tried. Appreciate ur contribution,btohqsg
Promo Code is not valid to be used:(a) with Mastercard  China Unionpay  American Express credit cards and credit cards issued outside of Singapore.(b) with debit/preloaded cards(c) on any additional fees incurred for Next Day payments.(d) in conjunction with any other promotions  offers or discounts.,btohqsg
Uses CDC card with card up for paying,btohqsg
It works. But note : CDC announce a nerf on cashback & limit effective 1st June 2022,btohqsg
Probably app haven't update. 1st jun is for those who stake finished and benefits will end 1 june,btohqsg
Any new stake after 1 may already don't have then10%,btohqsg
CDC is losing too much money,btohqsg
Hello everybody  jus wanna seek ur opinion on signing up credit card to get its freebies.Is it worth it to sign a CC to get a free standing table after spending $500 in 1 month using the CC?Or should I just buy an alternative cheaper standing table from taobao instead?,btohqsg
if you have an upcoming $500 ticket item then why not. but if you finding reason to spend $500 to get the free gift then probably no,btohqsg
What card to use with cArdup after the nerf?,btohqsg
Not only cdc nerf  uob one also nerf for $2000 spend tier lowered to 3.33%,btohqsg
Ya I saw for uob as well. :(,btohqsg
Still  no Better card for cardup.At least ipaymy has ocbc frank,btohqsg
Probably those pure cashback like Citi+ and uob absolute going nerf soon,btohqsg
I think they make quite decent profit. Just they want more profit,btohqsg
They are one of the widest spread around. And charges quite a lot for the fees,btohqsg
with all these nerf  everyone is feeling sad,btohqsg
going to wait for more global YTuber to explain the CDC situation,btohqsg
And guess I'm going to hold back on my UOB One card application,btohqsg
Confirmed unable to link ICBC Travel to Amaze instarem for the 4%. Pity.,btohqsg
If I use Citi+ and I system is 2.6% cb?,btohqsg
So no difference with 500 tier?,btohqsg
I think the one of the concerns about UOB one is that the CB is capped exactly at 3.33% for each tier. You spend $500 a month  your quarterly CB is $50  $1000 is $100  $2000 is $200.But you spend $500 you get $50 a quarter  you spend $999 also get $50. You really need to spend just the right amount to maximise.,btohqsg
But the advantages are no category capped  not like UOB Evol where you have online spending and contactless mobile payment. Good for those who not willing to track which categories.And also the additional CB like Shopee  Grab  Daily Farm & UOB travels. These CB are capped at $100 A MONTH  means you can spend up to $1500.,btohqsg
Chris  u have any promo for Maybank F&F card?,btohqsg
also  anyone happen to know why iphone sold at online shop like red & white mobile cheaper? thinking if it's more worth it to get there instead of apple store,btohqsg
Apple store's env and service are included in the price🤣,btohqsg
And you can do 24-month installment if you buy from Apple store,btohqsg
For example  if you knows how to invest and can make 10% annualized return  then 24-month installment is roughly equivalent to 10% off,btohqsg
Somebody's gotta pay for Matt Damon's appearance on tv commercials  ads  billboards etc ..,btohqsg
For now I am stacking my cashback,btohqsg
Abit of a hassle but worth,btohqsg
Guys 6051 MCC will it be considered as an online transaction by DBS WWMC ?,btohqsg
Planning on using instarem remittance service with my DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Anyone still gonna leave their cro staked for the 0% rewards and free Spotify/nflx? Seems like only Ruby card for free Spotify farming is worth it.,btohqsg
The 10% Apr is becoming 0% next mth,btohqsg
This iscrypto.comcard  I dont play with the exchange so i'm not sure. But if you stake before 1 May you still can get 10% APY until the 6 months is over. If restake after that is 0%,btohqsg
It looks more worth it to stake at its DeFi wallet after the nerf.,btohqsg
