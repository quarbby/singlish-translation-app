I believe Totachi oil price control buy dealer.ARC ah boonDr gearbox all $68Maybe workshop earn commission,btohqsg
EV cars usually have fewer things to pay for maintenance.No engine oilNo spark plugsNo air filterNo charge pipesNo engine overhaulNo pistonsNo need to clear carbon depositsNo Transmission fluidNo  ignition coilsNo alternatorNo water pumpNo coolant systemNo gasketsBrake discs and brake pads lasts for 6 or more years as Regen is usually used to slow the motor.Have Brake FluidHave Wiper FluidHave Aircon FilterDon't need AD to service/maintain these. Can go any workshop as it is generic.,btohqsg
Currently using this.frm Gary's $128. SK garage also carry this.It's  GF - 5 tho. Maybe GF 6 not shipped over yet.Many oil is GF-6 now. Like Totachi.https://www.sgcarmart.com/products/overview.php?ID=4720,btohqsg

There is quite a range of EV cars :)Less maintenance  means less down time...Also no need the followingTransmission fluid  ignition coils  alternator  water pump  coolant system  gaskets,btohqsg
No regular top up requiredI.e. No maintenance requiredBut yes   possible for unexpected faults to occur which requires top up etc,btohqsg
if it's successful . it will not be Alfa anymo,btohqsg
I think Alfa heads prefer it to be more exclusive...,btohqsg
Why’s that? Surely they want to sell as many as they can. They almost became bankrupt,btohqsg
