sec sch ofc people choose school of their cop caliber  but then jc  people then to choose taking into acct distance more (coz of longer sch hours and a lvl rigour),btohqsg
and also there are only that few jcs and some are really no go in terms of distance,btohqsg
My sch got someone from acs bru,btohqsg
in tmjc got quite some ppl from sec schs in the west,btohqsg
reasons why sgexams is slowly converting into sgteens,btohqsg
also got a girl from choa chu kang sec,btohqsg
and bpghs and nan hua and juying and bukit batok and acsi and so on,btohqsg
ur sch oso got ppl frm my sec sch,btohqsg
but tbh i think there will be fewer 6 pointers that go to JP and YI base on distance,btohqsg
sgexams mods only permitting r/s posts on weekends  knowing well that people will be more desperate to post during the weekends and the sub will be flooded with dirty minded people:,btohqsg
actually thinking about it  somehow my whole class is east-ne-central sec schools,btohqsg
my class has one guy from fuhua and one guy from juying,btohqsg
Actl tjc closest jc to my house,btohqsg
omg that is all the way in jurong,btohqsg
sge before 06-07' people invaded the sub was better,btohqsg
3 of us  in class living in the west ish area,btohqsg
one of them stay in victoria hall,btohqsg
eh wait is jp in jurong or pioneer,btohqsg
my ct say his ex student live in pasir ris went to river valley ip6 years of 2h journey,btohqsg
very shocking that JURONG PIONEER jc is in neither jurong or pioneer,btohqsg
my class got ppl frm west side. even tho theres ite west,btohqsg
i meant is it in the campus of jjc or pjc,btohqsg
somone frm my sec sch went ite west,btohqsg

tm is a sure mj campus coz mj is est 2003,btohqsg
04s are still okay la  even the r/s posts were lesser and had more logic,btohqsg
they revamping all the merge jc campuses,btohqsg
moving back to ajc campus once rebuilding complete,btohqsg
i wonder if it will shift back,btohqsg
now people only know how to post fake and unrealistic r/s posts just for clout,btohqsg
ik wat other sub is dead? r/ite,btohqsg
yijc will also move to IJC campus when they renovate it,btohqsg
nope certainly not + tpjc campus is holding tjc now and mjc campus is very new,btohqsg
i read somewhere will have upgrading only by 2030+,btohqsg
on my travel to tmjc i will pass by the ijc campus,btohqsg
Bruh i thought i was gonna do work today but i didnt ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
coz mjc is given birth in 2003 so it is still very new,btohqsg
no the campus only getting more moldy and dusty,btohqsg
if yijc = yjc+ijc and jpjc = jjc and pjc  does that mean sajc= sjc + ajc??? and isn't ajc the former anderson junior college? and isn't ajc = asrjc?? SO IT MEANS SAJC = ASR????,btohqsg
161/168 is the single reason why woodlands ppl even go to tmjc,btohqsg
maybe coz ijc dun bother to keep their campus new,btohqsg
i lived in woodlands last time  but it was lowk boring cos it was still isolated in the 2000s,btohqsg
i think they're seeking to rebuild ASRJC campus to look like EJC,btohqsg
then u change where? at ikea ah,btohqsg
the aft punggol road bus stop,btohqsg
the expressway is the reason my journey is reasonable,btohqsg
