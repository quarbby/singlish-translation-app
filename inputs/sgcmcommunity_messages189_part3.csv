2023 round-up: Toyota  Merc lead again; BYD makes huge wavesEven as Singapore's Top 3 hold steady  the rest of the Top 10 is seeing some surprising reshuffling as hybrid and electric cars continue to gain popularity.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 BYD like more hype than tesla,btohqsg
Not fair to count Toyota like that. Most r used for phv. Minus phv n commercial use  I think bmw rank first,btohqsg
And they put Lexus into Toyota,btohqsg
PML sells more PHV thn Borneo,btohqsg
Then rolls Royce put into bmw?,btohqsg
Unless BM n RR same agent lor,btohqsg
then volks Audi Porsche put into volks?,btohqsg
Like that not fair Toyota include Lexus. Then Volkswagen should include all Audi n Porsche,btohqsg
https://myelectricsparks.com/honda-gm-hydrogen-fuel-engines-unveiled/Well  this is something we can look forward to in the future should safety checks be cleared and production methods ironed out.,btohqsg
Thus the safety checks which I commented.,btohqsg
Technically our motor cars are just as dangerous (internal combustion) too.,btohqsg
Safety check No use 1 la. Ice engine also got safety check,btohqsg
It's a matter of perspective then. Some will say the same for our cars but the chances of it exploding are low.,btohqsg

Recently I feel like there are alot of cerato on the roads  like super common everywhere. Got deal from rental company to lease them out is it?,btohqsg
I think because it is widely accepted that lexus is just a Toyota in a nicer material. Same kind of engine  same reliability reputation and target the same type of buyer. The cars under VAG group are more diverse and target different people  so they never get lumped together.,btohqsg
It already is one of the cheaper sedans out there,btohqsg
Cos didn't work just now la 🤣,btohqsg
I thought rose is real person lol,btohqsg
so just let it be 1k lo,btohqsg

Hi guys how do i register my iu for auto deduct erp? I heard it’s possible. Thanks,btohqsg
Got 2 method..1. Vcashcard (only for erp)2. Nets Flashpay card with auto top up (for erp and majority of the car park),btohqsg
Why custom checkpoint don’t let us tap card?,btohqsg
Must insert into the hole and press button so kum gong,btohqsg
From number plate can tell what kind of car. still press button so stupid,btohqsg
Can setup auto top up with ezlink app also but doesn't work at some older carparks,btohqsg
It works for customs and ERP,btohqsg
Ezlink can  but not friendly to quite alot of car park  especially those shopping mall,btohqsg
After 3 month  I give up,btohqsg
Cost of upgrading is too prohibitive and they may alr have plans to replace all lanes with smth better eg erp type auto deduction or other automated payment system,btohqsg
I see that most of the govt policy is moving towards automation in everything,btohqsg
