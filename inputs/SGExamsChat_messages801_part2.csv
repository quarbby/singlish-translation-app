"i think is fake nric no  cuz iirc they didn't use the ""s"" system in 1942",btohqsg
there  after 1968  they started using the current sysyem,btohqsg
Born before means they didn't follow the S Year system,btohqsg
So a person born 1967 can be S13 or S17 depending on the registrar,btohqsg
i read it somewhere b4  it was a totally different system  they didn't use the s system,btohqsg
Has anyone noticed these black moths recently?,btohqsg
They did. Source my parents üòÅ just that it was sequential and no checksum was in place,btohqsg
Just solely order of issuance so can be S99 for all we know lmao,btohqsg
Price is ok but I‚Äôve seen cheaper durian buffets. I went for one msw durian buffet  cost $40 and I ate about 1.7kg of dehusked msw,btohqsg
Unfortunately I would shit a lot after that lol,btohqsg
Also I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôd hold the buffet in June  I thought for this year the peak should be in July since there would be both johor and Pahang durian seasons coinciding with each other,btohqsg
Try to find a cheaper one,btohqsg
Have you gone for one before tho,btohqsg
Must eat a lot in one sitting for it to be worth it,btohqsg
Heh  thanks for the analysis. I don‚Äôt fare well at buffets in general and have never been to one for durians before,btohqsg
If you can‚Äôt eat at least 1.5kg of dehusked durians (meaning seed and flesh only) in one sitting not rly worth it imo,btohqsg
Do you get to weigh what you ate? Or was it an estimate?,btohqsg
or just take all the durians and do qualitative analysis on them,btohqsg
They dehusk into the container then I weigh each round,btohqsg
You brought your own scale or was a scale available?,btohqsg
Ya  weigh my body and eat without drinking anything then weigh after lol,btohqsg
Works but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be possible to go through the whole thing without water,btohqsg
I guess you could try but buffets are such that almost all people can‚Äôt beat it,btohqsg
Also can hahahaha so cool. Then cannot pee siah,btohqsg
Comes out the same color isit,btohqsg
Also I had a bit of stomach pain for a few days after eating that much durian,btohqsg
Tbh after like the 3rd Durian I probably would be sianz liao as Durian the flavour a bit gao,btohqsg
Waw dam singtel seems to be upgrading their customers with a free wifi 6 router,btohqsg
