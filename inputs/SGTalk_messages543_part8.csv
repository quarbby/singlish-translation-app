"my friend just kenna...she received sms in the middle of the night. Then we deleted all our cards in those shopping apps...i think once in a while must do that...my bro is worse  someone called him asking for OTP...he claimed he is from lazada...someone used his card to buy shoes. At that time we were sharing one account to shop and i was browsing through ""his"" orders which i find it odd...my niece alerted me  then i quickly deleted all our cards and the orders",btohqsg
There is this lady in my ward. Middle of the night keep walk up n down  damn irritating,btohqsg
It's under same company  havefun ktv. If i not wrong.,btohqsg
I think so. Not 100% confirm.,btohqsg
Oh funtoast de office at.No wonder that time i keep seeing that havefun guy ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Not scary meh. Haha i overthink,btohqsg
Yeah  this is why for me I always disable online transactions for my card unless I actually need to do it. Then log into my online banking to enable online transactions  turn off right afterwards.,btohqsg
same i do that for all my cards except the one i use for transport  that one i top up as needed digitally,btohqsg
I never keep my cards anywhere online except Apple Pay. If whichever wants to successfully do transactions  need biometrics and password first,btohqsg
No.. but she cant slp  ppl want to slp,btohqsg
Recently i went oveaseas  i used youtrip card and i also lock the card whenever i dont use,btohqsg
She can go sofa corner mah,btohqsg
I only got 2 atm cards. No credit cards,btohqsg
I kena one time in end-2023  my card got phished at a gas station ATM which I think had a hidden card reader inside.,btohqsg
Another thing i do is normally banking txns i do at home or office alone. I dont  do it in public.,btohqsg
One week after I used that ATM  suddenly few hundred bucks disappeared out of my acct in succession  used by the phisher to top up their gambling account.,btohqsg
But had to change card which is annoying.,btohqsg
And then that particular gambling bookmaker company also banned my account because I flagged up to them fraud case.,btohqsg
Actually no  because I won quite a bit of money during World Cup.,btohqsg
Via online betting on that bookkeeper.,btohqsg
Can thank Scrabby for reverse indicator.,btohqsg
Dunno what is my lunch menu later,btohqsg

I am hungry. Waiting for 12pm,btohqsg
wtf? Which gas station?? Need take note,btohqsg
But as a point of note when overseas BE VERY CAREFUL OF ATMS.,btohqsg
Whenever possible if need to withdraw cash go and do it at a official bank's ATM.,btohqsg
Not those generic ATMs at public places like gas stations.,btohqsg
oki! I always use cash overseas,btohqsg
Best is have cash and youtrip card,btohqsg
and if lacking  I go straight to the bank,btohqsg
You are a rare breed. Nowadays everybody simi sai also contactless or card.,btohqsg
More and more businesses nowadays also don't do cash anymore.,btohqsg
and look at where the cameras and staffs are and stand in front of it to capture myself in it in case anything happens,btohqsg
If u go out with her  must bring enough change ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Once overseas  my gf used up all her cash and when we reached airport  there is airport tax payable and they only accept cash.,btohqsg
thatâ€™s true but whenever possible  use cash!!,btohqsg
Luckily the rest of us got cash left,btohqsg
If u go china.. die die is cashless,btohqsg
So better have some spare cash esp in overseas,btohqsg
Mostly but can always ask if accept cash,btohqsg
Banks are moving into non cheques trx. Coming 2026.. most probably cut down alot,btohqsg
Now banks imposing $20 for counter trx,btohqsg
Cheques dying out I can support.,btohqsg
Since covid  my company no issue sgd chq liao,btohqsg
The irony is Fish & Co still surviving  and even Botak Jones has made a comeback.,btohqsg
Ya 2 years back my parents go there  they donâ€™t accept cash and the wechat got many restrictions for foreigners. Now they accept cash liao,btohqsg
Now go there can use alipay n WeChat pay,btohqsg
