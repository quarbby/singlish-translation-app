Studied Micros over the weekendRecently highest volume.1) ArionEnt ($0.009/$0.010)Ntegrator’s Team Christian fella bought $0.011. From recent past failure on QT Vascular  they cannot afford a second fail.This price decline on Friday I believe an attempt to flush weak hands for them to collect cheap on the contra.$0.008 would be the bottomed bottom for this one.2) HSO ($0.003/$0.004)Buying came in last week.Stay tuned. This one needs a news catalyst and once it comes  the game starts. Already bottomed and very undervalued3) Asiatic ($0.005/$0.006)- sellers dried at $0.005. Impossible to get. Matter of time a micro BB will come to mouth $0.006. Until then.(FYI  Neo SSH bought $0.008)4) QT Vascular ($0.005/$0.006)- sellers almost dried at $0.005. Matter of time a micro BB will come to mouth $0.006. Game on then.Dark horses (starting to have some volume  can start to watch since Adventus and Addvalue start to spring into play  leading micros sentiments1) ICP ($0.009/$0.010)- noticed collection for a long time at $0.009. This one might just surprise us2) OEL ($0.011/$0.012)- $0.011 too have ongoing collection. This one flat and based out $0.010DYODD. I’m focus on Micros because 1 pip win is 5-25% win,btohqsg
