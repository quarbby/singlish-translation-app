Hello! Are there any overseas students here that applied for BTO? What do we have to prepare to show to HDB to prove that we are students?,btohqsg
proof of enrolment may suffice! u might want to call hdb to ask. i have yet to do so too,btohqsg
"Hey thanks! I was thinking what to show because the uni requires us to pay for the ""letter""",btohqsg
oh man maybe try calling hdb to ask!! maybe a proof that you accepted the offer or something that shows you are currently studying there would be enough  can try your luck asking,btohqsg
Concerned if Yishun area is heavily populated with birds. ?,btohqsg
The current Feb 2022 Yishun bto seems quite nice  but right beside a bunch of forest trees. Wonder if many birds will cause a noise problem there,btohqsg
Nowadays you don‚Äôt need to be neat forest to get birds calling in the morning   especially koels,btohqsg
In bedok its evening one particular tree only 7pm alot of birds for 1 hour. When I see forest I wonder what is the situation like,btohqsg
Theres a video on the feb 22 launch?,btohqsg
Some people go and review the place and the surrounding,btohqsg
Bird still ok  most likely u will hear gun shots at night,btohqsg
Me  i stay there nearby actually lol,btohqsg
No birds around so much forestry.. amazing.. looks is quite peaceful.  Gunshots ?,btohqsg
Not v often la but have.,btohqsg
That area generally quite peaceful but the morning and night traffic can be quite noisy if ur living facing that area,btohqsg
Traffick from small road or expressway m,btohqsg
What y'all think. Good spot or bad spot,btohqsg
I just want a serene quiet place,btohqsg
That place is quiet but do note that traffic is very bad due to the fact that the only way in or out is via yishun dam,btohqsg
Traffic when we are going to work ?,btohqsg
I would call it mini expressway,btohqsg
From the looks of it ah  the nearby only got 2 entrance to the mini expressway which MAY cause potential jam.I am not sure if they will open up 1 more entrance at the new BTO  like how they did with Melody Spring.,btohqsg
I think its bad also  but i personally never travel there yet cos i go by Mandai.,btohqsg
Cos that area links to TPE and CTE. CTE is towards CBD area. Weekend should be rather quiet.I travel there on weekends and its rather quiet.,btohqsg
Good spot  thats why got condo there hahaha. I heard the condo ppl there making noise cos HDB building a EC covering their view of the beautiful forest.,btohqsg

Hi Got Keat Hong verge group ?,btohqsg
The Government-related website is temporarily unavailable.We are working to restore normal service. Thank you for your patience.Timestamp: 2022-02-17-14-07-48,btohqsg
"1st PLH Rochor: ""PLH BTO will offer 3-room units at $409 000 to $474 000  while 4-room units are priced at $582 000 to $688 000.""2nd PLH King George: ""3-room flats in King George‚Äôs Heights$353 000 - $462 000 / 4-room flats in King George‚Äôs Heights$488 000 - $675 000""",btohqsg
Dakota Cres:3-room flats in Dakota Crest$352 000 - $456 000 / 4-room flats in Dakota Crest$522 000 - $688 000,btohqsg
No brainer to go for Dakota similar price but not PLH (less restrictions),btohqsg
Can be argued similarly for King George  if you are purely looking to stay. Cheaper and potentially higher floor and potentially less competition (due to PLH),btohqsg
Thats true also  plus King George is still 'nearer' to town by proximity afterall,btohqsg
I see application rates then decide üòú,btohqsg
Cfm Feb will eat gao gao empty plate,btohqsg

If you want a DIA  bring along your proof of enrolment that states you're a FT student,btohqsg
Does a student pass prove that you are a FT student?,btohqsg
Nope  if you're a FT-er  either there will be a mode of study (FT/PT) on your matriculation papers  or else you'll have to email and request for one from your registar for a student status letter. Should emphasise that you need the ft status from them,btohqsg
Any group for dakota BTO Feb 2022?,btohqsg
hi friends  would like to seek for advice. If in a couple  one is working whilst the other the graduating within a year  is it necessary to apply for HLE now? Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
you would need it for selection of BTO tho!,btohqsg
yeah but a very Low amount would affect the type of flat we can pick yes? ü•≤,btohqsg
it would just show how much loan HDB you are allowed to take.i believe it wont affect the type of flat you pick.but also do your due diligence to pick a flat that both of you can afford?,btohqsg
i know now you can keep 20k in cpf and wipe the rest,btohqsg

Hi just to check which BTo has a balcony for a 3 room flat?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if we need to have enough HLE loan amount to cover the remaining of the house during the booking of the flat . Then will be reviewed during the key collection to check whether you are able to service the loan.Or no need to have sufficient amount of HLE to cover the remaining payment of the house during the booking of the flat and then take the risk to review the HLE during the key collection which will be 4 to 7 years later as the loan amount might increase due to higher salary?Eg. House 600kCurrent CPF 60kEhg grant 35kHle currently given in 1st draft 250kWhich not enough to cover everything unless use cash and future cpf? And if there's an higher HLE amount in the future,btohqsg
If HLE not enough u will need to have enough CPF/cash for the balance.,btohqsg
HLE will increase when salary increase. But HLE will also decrease if ur age increase.,btohqsg
If you still young then age is not issue.,btohqsg
HLE is the amount they loan you.So u take (House - CPF - Gant - HLE) = remaining amount out of pocket,btohqsg
Oo thank you  does the HLE amount differ alot after 2nd review when the house is completed?,btohqsg
I think HLE Is based on your income and age. Except HDB change loan eligible.,btohqsg
HLE is dependent on income. If income no change  then it should be the same.,btohqsg
Another note  flat selection time u no need to pay the difference. It's only key collection time. So let's say flat selection u are short of 100k after everything in  it's ok. No problem  can proceed to booking first.When key collection  u need to furnish details that can cover ur entire cost of flat  like HLE or maybe u strike Toto and u got some cold hard cash.,btohqsg
But any idea if your 1st hle will be very different from the 2nd one or roughly the same if your pay increase slightly like afew  hundred dollars,btohqsg
Yup! I remember that time i also panic cos of the flat price and my HLE in sufficient etc.So when i went there i give the person all the docs.Then i say my HLE insufficient to cover the remaining cost how ah?He say its ok  HLE first flat choosing is just to see whether HDB will loan u or not only.If HLE cannot even get  means you need to furnish me bank loan details.I heave a sign of relief LOL,btohqsg
If got salary change  will definitely change,btohqsg
That's good to hear! Thanks alot appreciate you sharing ur experience üòä,btohqsg
Does that mean i can take grant w my current low and insufficient income (HLE given but not enough to cover price) and then during key collection when my income is higher i can redo HLE?And as long as HLE at key collection can cover the bto price is okay? Or will the grant amt be reassessed again?,btohqsg
Grant amount will not be assessed again. if with low income u get 80k grant  then when key collection ur salary significantly increase  ur grant is untouched.,btohqsg
But ur HLE will change cos ur salary will become higher,btohqsg
Grant will be dispensed just before u do flat selection,btohqsg
Sori i misread.. only hle will be reassesed,btohqsg
Hi there asking on behalf of my mother in law,btohqsg
Ohh that is near my flat valley spring . Its progress is still going strong,btohqsg
Sorry  I‚Äôm asking for a friend of mine. Her mom applied for a 2 room flat bto  and cos her mom had used up both hdb loans  she couldn‚Äôt get any loans and her mom has to pick the short lease. And if her mom cpf is not enuf  she has to pay a lumpsum cash. So the amount of the flat shown on hdb webpage e.g 40-80k  does it mean she has to pay tat big amount of cash? Or are there any automatic grant given for anyone buying bto?,btohqsg
Best person to answer  is to call up hdb directly,btohqsg
The info quite vague and insufficient.Best is to talk to HDB about your situation.,btohqsg
When will the open booking takes place?,btohqsg
I checked during lunch it says 16 Mar then will announce everything,btohqsg

Hello any Parc Clover folks here?,btohqsg
"Hello everyone. For the signing of agreement for lease  do we need to bring a valid hle letter during appointment if we choose to use hdb loan? Was wondering  as I thought they will only need hle again during key collection.As it stated in the website to only bring ic  cpf contribution and""Letter of offer from bank"" meaning for those bank loan ppl.",btohqsg
Is it part of the documents to prepare?If it is  then bring.,btohqsg
I sign my agreement in 2018 i think.They say no need to bring  BUT u still need to apply (cos they can see from the system).Because they want to see if HDB is willing to loan you $$.If you doing bank loan  also will need to bring the document cos they also want to know if bank willing to loan you.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to know during keys collection date   can we retain more CPF money in our OA ?,btohqsg
Just wondering. Anyone experience or know anyone who had experienced getting lower HLE amount compared to the HLE upon the selection of units?,btohqsg

hi. anyone know when the may woodlands north bto plans will be out?,btohqsg

I did my own research.  U need an approved HLE before the appointment.  Make sure the HLE is applied correctly.23rd March 12am  make sure u click fast and apply it.,btohqsg
I saw most of the open booking flats aren't really favorable.  But its individual needs.,btohqsg
Not necessarily  they actually can wait for it. It‚Äôs not a die die must get on that day. They are quite lenient abt it. (When I applied they were  not sure about now) But if u have it then better,btohqsg

I have booked a 3-room bto at Canberra Vista. Can someone advise whether there are windows in the utility area part of the OCS?,btohqsg
I visited the MyNiceHome gallery and I noted that the 4-room and 5-room did have windows at the Utility area. Please advise whether it is also part of the OCS or can windows and grilles be installed there. I heard that it is not possible until after MOP. I am asking on behalf of those who have booked their bto units at Canberra Vista,btohqsg
If u want a super confirm answer call up hdb to check  with them,btohqsg
Thank you. Try getting someone from hdb on the phone is a real pain but I will try. Thought someone may know,btohqsg
If u visit those new hdb default  all no windows and grilles,btohqsg
Generally the outer windows are not provided by HDB  it is only the louvre windows which is the divider between the kitchen and yard which is provided by HDB.My BTO which is about to TOP is that case,btohqsg
Thank you for the info but for the 3-room it is totally open concept and there is no divider (wall) separating the kitchen and utility area,btohqsg
I had a look at your estate 3RM Floorplan  indeed it is unlike the usual... Good news! seems like it is included as part of the default offering by HDB,btohqsg
if you want to be doubly sure - just email the Customer support who is tagged to your estate  you can find out the person under your myHDB page. they will reply within 14 working daysSave your time by trying to get through to their hotline,btohqsg
Thank you for the info however not being a very techy person how do you even go to MyHDB page. Could not even find it.,btohqsg

Only after mop then can apply,btohqsg
U have to take note of the second timer levy,btohqsg
Also - the quota set for 2nd timers are only 5% of the total population for mature estates I remember,btohqsg
I checked with HDB staff before  they say as long as your MOP is over when you select the unit it would be ok,btohqsg
Can I ask about open market ?,btohqsg

The number of BTO projects delayed by 6 months or longer has dropped to 58 this year from 74 in 2021  says National Development Minister Desmond Lee.https://str.sg/w2NHHDB will also be launching 5 BTO projects on May 27  including 2 under the prime location housing model.https://str.sg/w2NV,btohqsg
waiting time is ridiculous .. 2027,btohqsg
Very bad with numbers  Im not that good with all these,btohqsg
Hello guys. Plz help me see this does it mean if I get a 3 room  every month the deductions will likely be like 690  after cpf then pay remaining in cash? If cpf every month OA $400++.. top up $200++? Thanks. I am a single parent that's why I'm alone support the bto I I apply üôè,btohqsg
can i have the photo again?,btohqsg
For this there is alot of assumptionBased on the photo:They assume you‚Äôre drawing a salary of3000$Price of the 3room is240 000$You have CPF (OA) savings of at least36 000$Your EHG will be65 000$based on the 3000$ salaryYour monthly repayment will be estimated to be$631So if you want to pay more by cash you can do soEg 231$ cash 400$ cpf is ‚úÖ,btohqsg
But if you can use your entirety of your CPF to offset will be great. Have some spare liquidity cash on hand. Put in some long term investment plan may get you higher than the 2.6% interest. And also the monthly repayment will differ from the table if the house price is more than 240 000$. Or if your CPF saving is less than 36 000$,btohqsg
If I draw1900-2500depending cause I'm a gym sales staff some months like January there is more sales I can hit up to $3000. Rest of the months just getting by with1900-2300,btohqsg
My cpf I think 17000 only,btohqsg
But every month contributtions is about 600 at least,btohqsg
Anyone know how MCPS scheme will work with SBF?If there is 2 units available will they still allocate 30% of these 2 units to mcps scheme?,btohqsg

But what is 30% of 2 units?ü§®,btohqsg

You might want to check how much can u get for the housing loan first by applying for it. They will let u know with ur current income  how much will they loan u n the monthly payment u will need to pay either using CPF or by cash.,btohqsg
From the image  the housing loan of 139k is based on the 3k household income. You might get lesser loan amt based on ur income. Which also mean u might need to pay off more than 36k for the remaining depending on how much ur bto unit cost.,btohqsg
I think u will only know how many pple has applied when the application close?,btohqsg

Hello. I need help.My mum is currently trying to sell her EC  to stay with us  if we get this BTO/SOBF. Am I able to put her under occupier ?Hoping for someone to know this answer. :),btohqsg
Hi guys  just asking  my gf is working now and im still in NS  planning to apply for BTO  can we use the grants that we will get for our downpayment for the flat and top up if needed?,btohqsg
I think the grants will only be given into your CPF account post the booking OTP (5% Downpayment)..,btohqsg
Is there a way to check the how much the SBF flats were previously sold for when they were launched as BTOs?Ie  their initial price vs current SBF price,btohqsg
Last time came across a web say above bto price but below open resale price. If u need to be specific  u gotta dig the data in the web  they are there.,btohqsg
The grant will be in ur cpf which can be used to pay for downpayment provided ur grant application is completely during the unit selection.,btohqsg
Hi! Does BTO come with a toilet bowl if we choose the optional scheme?,btohqsg
The toilet bowl is it those eco-friendly one with a small wash basin on top ? I sat on someone TikTok bto revealing,btohqsg
One changed (upgraded) it later at her own cost,btohqsg
The referance picture do u have it ? I forgot what it looked like ? Is it this case for all bto in the future ? So If we do not choose to install. Then we renovate with external contractors?,btohqsg
I remeber it looking kinda cramp and awkward üòÜ,btohqsg
Sorry no picture. If don't select option you can renovate & design however you like,btohqsg
For SBF  are the available flats listed confirm available for the successful applications of this round? Or isit they may be chosen by those who got it from the previous round before the current round gets to choose?,btohqsg
Eh hello  phone lagged earlier. Don't so quickly block users can or not? 60 seconds too short.,btohqsg
During appt if yr booking number is early that would better as u got the chance to choose the unit that u have selected provided other applicants before u have not chosen it same goes to those units which has keys available too.,btohqsg

For next launch AMK BTO  what is the requirement to apply for 3Gen?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have similar situation where my bf is still in army and we want to try bto for the first time. I‚Äôm currently working full time but soon transiting to part time as I‚Äôm going to start university soon. But the hdb staff asked me to apply under employed as I was working full time when I‚Äôm applying.So will we still be able to get the staggered down payment scheme? Would like to ask if anyone knows more about the staggered downpayment scheme? As was wondering how do HDB determine if you can get it or do we have to go and apply separately?And does applying for the HLE  tell us whatever grants that we are eligible to apply or must ee ownself go and findüòÖ,btohqsg
As I know that if staggered downpayment then is 5% if not must 10% upfront first,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm abit worried if we can‚Äôt get the staggered downpayment,btohqsg
5% first thh 10% later stage,btohqsg
I think it may have changed though?,btohqsg
Wait those experienced ppl say bah i also nt experience üòÄ,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to send the pic or link here but I saw the hdb website yesterday and it says 10% of downpayment if take hdb loan then if can get staggered downpayment then is 5% then when collecting keys is another 5% or something! Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
Please kindly reply to my questions everyone  if anyone knowsüôèüèª,btohqsg
From late Dec 2021 HDB* rules changed to 15% downpayment,btohqsg
It's age based i think. Under 30 or something.,btohqsg
is there any ways that i can share the link here?,btohqsg
If you are taking a housing loan from HDB:You need to pay 10% of the flat's selling price as downpayment using CPF and/ or cash.First-timer buyers and existing flat owners right-sizing to a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat who qualify for the Staggered Downpayment Scheme only need to pay a 5% downpayment. The balance purchase price is payable at the time of key collection.,btohqsg
This is what i found at the hdb website,btohqsg
Im on staggered downpayment scheme. Both applicant must be below 30 yo at the point of application. Apply as fiancee/fiance.5% during lease agreement and 5% during key collection. (Based on hdb loan) if you are on bank loan  you maybe have to fork out 10% more during key collection.,btohqsg
Thts for flats purchased before Dec 2021 right? After Dec 2021 I recall additional 5%,btohqsg
Ya. Didnt know got new change,btohqsg
Actually just go hdb website and check. The details are very clearly stated.,btohqsg
yes i did but i was still abit confuse as im a first timer,btohqsg
Based on ur said situation  you both definitely can be under staggered down-payment scheme. (Rmb to select fiance/fiancee scheme during BTO application),btohqsg
So it does not matter if you are employed or not employed?,btohqsg
It doesnt matter for the scheme. What you need to worry is your HLE and Loan Quantum.,btohqsg
The HLE letter is mainly to see if you can get housing loan right? which is the HDB loan right? is different from like the enhanced cpf grants and all right?,btohqsg
Yes. During booking of flat (the very first appointment)  they will ask if you want to apply for grants etc  can apply on the spot.,btohqsg
Sorry one more question  so for the staggered downpayment thing  do we need to specially apply for it or it is auto given if we met the criteria?,btohqsg
Dont need to apply. If you meet the criteria  say that you want staggered payment during the 1st appointment.,btohqsg
Okay understand  thank you so much for helping,btohqsg
All the best to your BTO application!,btohqsg
Mm mm! You too if you are applyingüôèüèª,btohqsg
Looking at yishun but it seems like alot people applied for it hahaha,btohqsg
Which area you guys think that many people will bid for it?,btohqsg
Was actually planning for yishun too but now gonna go for bukit merah ba,btohqsg
But bukit merah the downpayment chor,btohqsg
Also make sure you have enough to make the 5% downpayment...since you are going to study full time..,btohqsg
i think downpayment is always the main issue for younger couples,btohqsg
Can use both partners cpf or cash right?,btohqsg
Places like yishun i think should be okay,btohqsg
Prime location like what ^ said is very high,btohqsg
Is there a percentage that they limit to for OA accounts or just can use up all?,btohqsg
Must leave behind 20k the last i checked,btohqsg
yishun is around 328000 to 418000 sgd,btohqsg
Wait what? Parents cpf?? Can use,btohqsg
what if you dont even have 20k in the OA? HAHAHA,btohqsg
partners meaning your gf or bf,btohqsg
but let say maybe u have 10k in OA  so you cant even use the 10K?,btohqsg
If u only have 10k i wouldnt even recommend you to BTO tbh but good qn üòÇ,btohqsg
I need pay everything in cash sia,btohqsg
because we had the thought that there is the waiting time  so by the time we already have been working,btohqsg
and i heard that you can use cpf and cash at the same time to downpayment,btohqsg
that why we went for it,btohqsg
but i didnt know there is a limit or smth for OA,btohqsg
I jus googled and saw you can wipe out CPF for housing,btohqsg
oh thats a good news then,btohqsg
But CPF got recommend to retain 20k for safety net.,btohqsg
is okay  i think our cpf dont even have 20k to begin with,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/4-must-ask-questions-before-getting-your-bto#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20a%20first %2420%2C000%20aside%20for%20future%20needs.you can choose to use up all or set aside (max) $20k,btohqsg
Should be can use all but can opt to leave 20k,btohqsg
by the way can i ask why i cant seem to send link or pic?,btohqsg
other people like can send ah,btohqsg
i wanted to show the website that i found saying for this may bto 2022,btohqsg
Make sure you choose co-applicant and not occupier,btohqsg
yes i did choose co applicant,btohqsg
everytime i send a link or screenshot  it just get deleted  anyone know why?,btohqsg
but at least this is a relieve i guess,btohqsg
because even if the applicant get a queue number  they still have to wait for awhile to choose and then pay option fee then wait around 4 month to 2nd appointment right?,btohqsg
The 5% downpayment have to pay when? after the selection?,btohqsg
i think is the sec appointment  when u sign the lease agreement form i think,btohqsg
you can check out the moneysmart bto article,btohqsg
i think they got say the steps or smth but idk why but i cant seem to send the link here,btohqsg
you're welcome! just trying to help with whatever i know for now :),btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-leaseat the date of selection you have to put an option fee ($2000 for 4rm or bigger)after that about 4 months or so  HDB will request you go down to sign the lease. at that point in time you need to pay 5% if you are eligible for the staggered down payment schemehahah my wife and I booked a BTO if you have any questions can PM me :),btohqsg
I see  so the remaining 10% will be paid during key collection right? In the case where you are eligible for the staggered scheme,btohqsg
anyone here applied for Jurong West?,btohqsg
I heard JW quite popular this time round because near Jurong Lake Gardens and Lakeside,btohqsg
The current application rates  JW is the most popular,btohqsg
can fill me in  how many applications submitted this time round for 4 rooms?,btohqsg
I would say it's the potential worth of the flat  as the government is expanding the Jurong Lake District,btohqsg
i am just praying that the Married Child Priority Scheme will come in handy,btohqsg

Hi if i apply for SBF for may 2022 can I still apply for Aug 2022 BTO?,btohqsg
The Aug Jurong East location very ulu though ü§£ it's nearer to bukit batok n don't really have direct bus to JE MRT  if want direct bus to JE need to walk a dist.,btohqsg
Okies lah at least got direct bus üòÇ The only thing is next to PIE  so if you don't like hearing cars 24/7 (especially ambulances since near NTFGH)  probably not a good location,btohqsg
i kept thinking the Aug JE will be beside the swimming complex cos they are like building something ..,btohqsg
property guru article put it to be infront of Chinese garden mrt  at the empty plot infront of the condo,btohqsg
üòÇ that will be in bukit batok liao,btohqsg
Hi  any idea if I‚Äôm listed as an essential occupier  will I still be able to use the MCPS?,btohqsg
Bto this round Sian not interesting,btohqsg
If you received a number for SBF MAY 2022. Then you may get a chance to pick a unit before the AUG BTO happen. So in that case  no.,btohqsg
At leastoneof:* Good location* Reasonable price* Livable design* Fast build time,btohqsg
/Hiis there any groupbuy for gaincity for aircon?,btohqsg
If get a queue number for SBF but never select  is there penalty?,btohqsg
Yes can be counted as non selection but can try writing to them if you have legitimate reason,btohqsg

With about 40 per cent of invited applicants deciding not to book a flat  first-timer families applying to projects with application rates below 1.7 times stand a good chance of booking a flat.

5 times only. some here tried more than 10 times... mps sought. Myself included. Useless  cos everyone is in the same situation as you. Just look at the subscription rates. Demand vs supply. Nothing that they can do. Unless you tried 3rd child priority  5 times still fail  then can consider asking them.,btohqsg
Maybe cos MP nvr write for us lo,btohqsg
It's not that I don't know that the rates are bad  just wondering if MP letter helps,btohqsg
Write also ineffective... if u read this hdb article  you'll know what sort of ans to expect,btohqsg
This one they replying to forum letter ma  not replying MP üòà,btohqsg
Unless you are saying that with MP letter  this was the reply you got from HDB and still didnt get a flat  then I would agree that yes  write no use,btohqsg
u try and let me know if it work please. Then I go knock on mp door again,btohqsg
That's why  depends on ur case. If u are first timer couple. No kids... forget it,btohqsg
Effectively  MP can only write a letter to recommend  but not change the results,btohqsg
maybe got chance if that MP is in charge of Housing,btohqsg
Applied 14 times. 4 times MP letter  3 letters under LHL grc. Ended with resale. So yup you do the chances calculation yourself,btohqsg
Guess the one my friend managed to get a few years back after MP letter was likely chance then,btohqsg
Really just pray hard that the ballot system will be good to you. I myself applied for priority scheme but I don't give myself too much hope.,btohqsg
U can try but dont pin hopes,btohqsg
Resale is extremely expensive now  but if really need a house now  need to sacrifice abit. In fact  the benefits for resale e.g staying near parents  kids  etc  may put the price point on par with BTO.,btohqsg
Then did u still vote for him hahah sigh,btohqsg
U sure i vote for him? You saw my votes?,btohqsg
lol. Is there a all powerful MP? I would like to move to their estate.,btohqsg
Haha I only ask if u did  glad you didn't,btohqsg
Housing is a big issue  but somehow no one pushes for much change here,btohqsg
Buy resale also dangerous  if kena sers dunno how,btohqsg
My gf stay under lhl grc. Never see him or the grassroots leaders. The surrounding blocks area very dirty  lots of rats n cockroaches at night,btohqsg
Good ma Kenna sers. Get a brand new 99yrs Lease flat üòÅüëç,btohqsg
When will the bto results be out ah,btohqsg
Actually. IMHO when I looked closely for those needed to top up. They have their loan ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good thing for them or not.,btohqsg
Same as batok area  there nickname rat kingdom,btohqsg
I thought murali very popular and well liked there,btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is a rule for new PR to not be able to buy BTO?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so. As long one spouse is Singapore citizen.,btohqsg
Anyone knows grp for sengkang bto?,btohqsg

Hi  do anyone have any idea if after submission of BTO application  can I still utilise the Married Child Priority scheme (MCPS) in my application? Appreciate if anyone could answer thisüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
As we misunderstood the scheme  thinking it only apply to resale flat,btohqsg
Only to find out the second point was referring to bto,btohqsg
once application is submitted and closed  i dont think you are able to add this in,btohqsg
Ya I don‚Äôt think you can amend your application.You can only place another $10 for a new application to supersede the old if it is still within the application periodJust have to take note next time  anyways the MCPS not a sure win  gives you an additional chance on a selected % of the estate depending on the maturity. For my side  it was 20%,btohqsg
Just pray that you heng and still get a queue #,btohqsg
The only loss is the additional ballot chance,btohqsg
If it makes you feel better  a lot of ppl still don't get a queue number even with mcps anyway so might as well be no diff,btohqsg
Thanks for all your help to clear my doubts üò¨,btohqsg
Hi all. How does hdb bto balloting system works? Do they separate first timer and second timer base on their % allocated?,btohqsg
are bto results coming out soon?,btohqsg
1st timer just get 2 ballot while 2nd timer only have 1. Basically just 1 extra ticket to get selected.,btohqsg
Hi any updates for bto feb 2022 flat selction date?,btohqsg
btw  for the Deferred Income Assessment scheme  if both of us just completed full time studies within 12 months  but one of us has been working part time for more than 12 months  are we still eligible?,btohqsg
During my HDB appointment  we were told that as long as you‚Äôre studying full-time  your PT/FT work during that course of time you were studying still won‚Äôt count.In my case  our DIA will be pushed to 3 months prior to key collection where they‚Äôll re-assess and allocate the grant amount based on the salary you‚Äôre getting then.,btohqsg
ahhh I see...thank you v much! :D,btohqsg
Because I will be going NS  then my partner working PT but just completed full tiem studies in May,btohqsg
From what was explained during our appointment  I think they‚Äôll only start counting the period of employment from May/June onwards. You could write in to HDB/give them a call to seek advice on this too just to confirm again :),btohqsg
yeah good idea  you have explained it so well to me  thank you very much  really appreciate it! :D,btohqsg
No worries. All the best with your BTO journey! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Thank you very much  yours too :D,btohqsg
Anyone has the link to lakeside May 2022 bto?,btohqsg
Hi  do we need to apply for HLE again for 2nd appointment? Current one has expired.,btohqsg
Yes. If you have not selected any unit and your current HLE has expired  you need to apply HLE again,btohqsg
Hi! When did the queue no. results of feb 2022 BTO get posted out?:D,btohqsg
First timer here. Applied for May 2022 BTO and just received HDB's letter telling me to wait for a ballot number. When do you get notified your ballot number after receiving the letter from HDB?,btohqsg
letter is just an fyi.  a waste of paper. everyone who applied got it,btohqsg
hmmmm but last time my letter was a straightforward reject leh... acknowledged application and say we didn't make the cut üôÑ,btohqsg
Do anyone knows  if I paid for option fees for a unit which I applied in Nov-2021  and later on was called to select units for e.g. May-2022 SBF. Can I give up the option fees & unit  and select a new unit in SBF? Is there any penalties ?,btohqsg
