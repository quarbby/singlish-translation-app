Ministry of Healthon B1617 variantThe B1617 variant prevalent in South Asia is not just a Singapore problem. The World Health Organization has deemed it a variant of global concern.According to the Gisaid Institute  Europe has sequenced almost 2 000 B1617 infections  US 486  Australia 85  Japan 29 and China 17.This is a major reason why transmission is rising throughout Asia -- in Malaysia  Thailand  Japan. Even hitherto safe regions  such as Singapore  Taiwan and Vietnam  are experiencing outbreaks of community cases.These cases all originated from imports because all borders are porous. All it takes is one case to cause an outbreak  and no country can seal itself off totally. At the minimum  citizens and residents must be allowed to return home.For imported cases in Singapore  we reported 409 cases over 28 days from 16 Apr to 13 May. 41.6% of them were SC/PRs  50.6% were Work pass holders  student pass holders or dependents  and 7.8% were short term visitors. All short term visitors are allowed to enter only if they have family ties here  or on specific compassionate grounds such as to attend a funeral  or seek medical treatment.If we just look at South Asia  the number of imported cases over the past 28 days was 271  comprising 50.2% SCs/PRs  46.5% work pass holders  student pass holders or dependents and 3.3% short term visitors.Every arrival is subject to stringent SHN and tests. Community transmission occurred nevertheless because the virus breached our safe measures  including at Changi Airport.The infiltrating virus can be from SC/PR/work pass holders or a short term visitor. This is a challenge faced by all countries because no one can entirely close their borders.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159126755365631&id=154909330630,btohqsg
