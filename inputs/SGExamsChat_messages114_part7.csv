Sorry I read Chinese very slow,btohqsg
I get A2 uh but those like fail one I can probably help u guys at least pass lor,btohqsg
But for me my bad point is that I know how to read many Chinese word but can't write a lot  so probably I will help them with paper 2,btohqsg
I skip half the words during Chinese exams ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Lol it wasn't you who deleted the message,btohqsg
You prob should have a look at my acad profile first before making comments about my acad  but since you prob aren't going to enjoy ur unfounded disdain,btohqsg
I can tell from incoherent sentences and so not going to waste my time. Gonna study about diabetes now cya.,btohqsg
Alright  enough is enough  both of you. I don't want to see anything more on this topic tonight,btohqsg
Bruh have a look at who started what,btohqsg
I don't care who's right or wrong. My interest is in keeping discord out of public groups. If you want to  go and continue the conversation in private,btohqsg
Keeping discord out of the group?,btohqsg
Lol someone should take that out of context,btohqsg
Telegram is declaring war on discord,btohqsg
Man I should try be more active on here again,btohqsg
Tbh discord is pretty cool  but I'm not going to download the phone app,btohqsg
I don't actually use the phone discord app,btohqsg
Only reason why I'm in discord atm is cause my PC is on,btohqsg

https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gz7sre/uni_write_to_your_mp_your_concerns_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThis gives me so much second-hand embarrassment ðŸ˜«They really said a lot of things that are supposed to be unsaid ðŸ˜‚Poor thing tho  it must be the emotions speaking,btohqsg
Oh! Lmao I thought John Smith was joking lol didnâ€™t realise they deleted,btohqsg
Itâ€™s election year  need to seize the opportunity to make demands (in terms of Uni admissions),btohqsg
COVID19 overseas go local more competition,btohqsg
Unfair senior last year same score can go the course this year they cannot,btohqsg
Tbh this argument falls flat  the number of intl students to SG would fall too,btohqsg
Itâ€™s along the lines of election year so writing to MP more power,btohqsg
The rest you can see in comments,btohqsg
Y wood MP help people who arenâ€™t even able to vote,btohqsg

Im studying a total of 8 years to get a medical degree lel so just work hard and u will get there jiayou ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This might well be true ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
It was OPâ€™s emotions speaking  I donâ€™t think they mean to be dramatic  and seeing how this post was made very early in the day  itâ€™s probably after like profound overwhelming sadness,btohqsg
The ideas may not be as logical but the emotions are valid,btohqsg
Lol just suck it up and make the most of what u got. Indeed I plan to do a masters in laws (with medical law as an elective) midway my med degree also (asking them if can disrupt). U shape your own future.,btohqsg
Dont externalise blame. Many of our ministers came from humble backgrounds so inasmuch as I believe in luck egalitarianism  I believe one shd be accountable for ones actions too,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” are schools even obligated to respond to appeals from mp,btohqsg
