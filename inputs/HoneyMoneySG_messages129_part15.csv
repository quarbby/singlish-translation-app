Omg  I thought some jp shops only accept card not Apple Pay is because they let you place a card on the tray and they tap it for you. And it is kinda stupid to put phone on the tray.🤡,btohqsg
u are supposed to pay off ur statement in full each month. this applies to all banks.if u only pay minimum due  u will still incur interest charges.if u don’t pay at all  u will incur interest charges and late payment fees,btohqsg
Aiya. At this pt it's their custom to have the tray for cash/card already. I just accept it haha.,btohqsg

Just a clarification  6.8% is applicable only for first 30 days correct ? But Need to hold funds for 60 days  then next 30 days only around 3% according to the fund performance ?,btohqsg
its UP TO 6.8%if u are putting in sgd fund its 3.xx% + 1.68% topup by moomoo,btohqsg
Hi my tbill mature date is 3rd sep. can I know how long is back to my dbs acc? I still see the investment there. I using cpf. I wanna transfer back.,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter as CPF pays lowest balance of the month. Move back 4th sep or 20th sep. Same.,btohqsg
Noted  but do u know how long does it reflect in acc after mature?,btohqsg
By right today should be cash in cpf ia,btohqsg
If we buy tbills using CPF funds  will we be notified about how much was successfully alloted? Or if unsuccessful will inform too?,btohqsg
Hi hi  if i want to use UOB KF credit card to pay my hotel for wedding banquet — do I need to link it with Amaze so that it records as “Online Travel”? Or if the hotel sends me an online payment link is that sufficient to qualify for the Accelerated miles? I read the T&Cs and im not sure if “Online Travel” is only restricted to just the whitelisted booking sites…,btohqsg
Short answer doesn't work. You will only get 1.2mpd,btohqsg
Money shd appear ur dbs acc right,btohqsg
I tot we need to transfer back to cpf,btohqsg
From dbs investment acc… I rem I did it during first time…,btohqsg
Yes u transfer it from your cpf investment account to your cpf ordinary account.,btohqsg
Is this done using cpf app or dbs?,btohqsg
I do mine with Uob desktop internet banking.,btohqsg
Hmmm let me see it need to be done from desktop,btohqsg
I manage to find the option using dbs desktop. Ty. Btw does it take a while for it to arrive to cpf or instant?,btohqsg
Ty both. I check again tml. TYVM for all who advise,btohqsg
Any webull sg users here? Can I check for warrant shares  is it they don't support and will immediately exercise the warrant to convert into mother shares and credit to your account?,btohqsg
anyone knows if ocbc what time refresh/clocks balance?,btohqsg
Hi i know someone who is starting her first full time job soon and are interested in a high interest savjngs accouny together with a easy to use credit card (preferably point credit card for mile) is there any that is recomended,btohqsg
Uob one account paired with Uob lady credit card or Uob one credit card.,btohqsg
What do you mean refresh or clock balance?,btohqsg
as in a time to say lock in   ur daily balance,btohqsg
So happy can finally ditch amaze.Consider it a buff for me. 😇,btohqsg
Mt already gave you a decent option. Btw  as you said you are just starting ur first job  I suggest doing a simple calculation if your current spending level will get enough miles to redeem within reasonable amount of time (like max 2-3 years). If not  cashback card like uob one cc is a better choice imo.,btohqsg
I started the miles game in secondary school.,btohqsg
oops read wrongly. My suggestion still stands though.,btohqsg
Really super apolegetic to ask something i believe has been heavily asked..i tried searching and reading previous chats  but the info are like so varied i cant really piece them together 🙏🙏🙏May I know is it quite a good choice to use UOB lady solitaire plain to spend in overseas?(I only have amaze  youtrip  uob lady  ocbc rewards  citibank premier and hsbc premier. Whats a good way to pay in my upcoming trip tmr..)Once again  really sorry to ask🙏,btohqsg
Can check if can use credit card to pay for hdb down payment?,btohqsg
Compare UOB stash vs OCBC 360 with spend & saveWhich is better interest,btohqsg
What are ur 2 uob lady sol categories?,btohqsg
I think ocbc 360 has more better interest.,btohqsg
Let say uob one u already 100k the left over $ put until UOB stash or OCBC 360 if u can only meet the save & spend category,btohqsg
No you put till 150k in uob one. 😅,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. But sorry ah.. may i ask in my case  what shd i best use?🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
Ya checked 150k the interest go up hefty but hmm though the banks insurance coverage is up to 100k,btohqsg
Worry put so much in one basket 🧺,btohqsg
Thank you!!!😍 you are most helpful!! 🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
Good morning all gurus  could I confirm that crmc rewards are based on statement month please? My apologies but could I also ask does statement month refers to the statement cycle please? Or is it still by month please? Thank you.,btohqsg
To add onto what the folks shared. If didn't pay a credit card bill in full  interest would also be charged onnew transactionsof the card that has not been billed as well.,btohqsg
My experience is by the next business day. If u r using DBS as the agent bank for your CPF OA Investment scheme  the interest rate is 0.05% (anyone know the interest for OCBC and UOB?). Given that the OA interest CPFB gives us is much higher than the agent bank  I wouldmanuallytransfer back to my CPF OA at the earliest opportunity rather than wait for 20 Sep or the end of the month,btohqsg
Then you just contradicted yourself. If DBS gives interest for keeping it in CPF-IA  it would be better to keep it till the end of month before transferring back to CPF-OA. At least you're getting some interest from DBS for keeping it in CPF-IS.,btohqsg
Sorry  can I check roughly how many days for it to get posted with crmc direct? Charged on 2 Sep. Still pending  today cut off for statement liao.,btohqsg
Thanks! I see where u r coming from. But I am a forgetful person so I won't want to risk missing out the 2.5% p.a interest to earn 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Giving advice to not risk is one thing  but telling people that transferring near end of month gets you lesser interest isfactually incorrect.P.S. UOB CPF-IA gives daily 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
