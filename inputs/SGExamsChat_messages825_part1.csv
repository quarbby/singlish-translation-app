(male interviewer  teenage girl interviewee)M What was your first gymnastics club like?F My mum got me to join when I was six. My older sister was already a member and I always feltat home there. I went twice a week initially. I always had plenty of ability ‚Äì though no more thanseveral other girls there ‚Äì but I couldn‚Äôt always follow the coach‚Äôs instructions at the beginning.Then  as my skills started to develop ‚Äì when I was about nine ‚Äì I switched to five times aweek. My dad would often take me for extra training before school. I forced myself to reallyconcentrate and practise things over and over again. That‚Äôs how I came to really stand out  andit‚Äôs when I began to win local club competitions.M You were twelve when you took part in your first major championships. What was that experiencelike?F Well  in the lead up  there was hardly any pressure on me. I‚Äôd been recovering from an injury which restricted my training. My coach  who was brilliant  told me I‚Äôd be up against girls whowere stronger and more experienced  but that I shouldn‚Äôt get stressed about it. She encouragedme to attempt a couple of jumps and a back flip I‚Äôd never performed before in public  but alsosaid I should enjoy myself  and not worry about mistakes or points  let alone medals. I did whatshe said  and it was great.,btohqsg

Mb i was watching movie jnOk so right the notes r actually so fkin shit like i saw smth that was not in the syllabus and right the teachers are actually so nasty like theres the old teachers who shld be in a nursing home rn if yk who im talking about and most of the other teachers like bo chap abt our studies liddat  they lowkwey look like they want sleep. Then right during orientation lecture a chem cher sat down next to me and started sleeping in a chem lecture. Another thing is that the studnets in MI are generally such a bad influence like istg no idw vape and lie MI IS A PLACE OF OPPORTUNITIES??? MY ASS?? THE OPPORTURNITIES THEY GIVE R SO FKING BASIC I COULD FIND THEM EASILY. THERE ARE LITTLE DECENT OPPORTURNITIES TO BE FOUND IN MI I LITERALLY HAVE TO GOOGLE FOR DECENT COMPETITIONS. AND THEY ASK WHY SO MANY STUDENTS RETAIN OR DONT DO WELL?? ANOTHER THING IS THAT ALL OF THE LECTURES ARE HELD IN CLASS LIKE WTF? THAT WASTES SO MUCH TIME LIKE AFTUALLY AND THE TEACHERS SPEAK SO SLOW AND ALL I LITERALLY CANNOT STAND ONE MORE MINUTE HERE LIKE PLS ATEAST HAVE HALF THE LECTURES ONLINE. MANY PPL OSO LIKE PON CLASS ITS BECOMING MI CULTURE TO SKIP CLASSES EH ISTG. ALSO THE CB FKING CANTEEN FOOD IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY EH ITS NOT THAT BAD BUT ITS NOT WORTH MY MONEY. AND WHATS UP WITH THE TIMETABLE BRUH ITS PLANNED SO BAD LIKE SO MANY BREAKS IN BETWEEN. ALSO ONE THING I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IS WHY MI DONT ALLOW STUDENTS WHO LIVE AT THE OTHER FRICKING SIDE OF SINGAPORE TO HAVE SOME GRACE PERIOD LIKE HELLO?? I KNOW AT LEAST 3 PEOPLE IM MY CLASS THAT STAY AT PASIR RIS AND TAMPINES. I WOULD LIKE TO END THIS OFF BY SAYING THAT THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT MI IS THAT YOU HAVE 1 MORE YEAR FOR THE A LEVEL CURRICULA BUT MI IS NOT UTILISING IT WELL .,btohqsg
