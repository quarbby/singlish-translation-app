ok  just move on then. No need think about it since it doesn't matter to u.,btohqsg
Which just brings me back to the very origin of my initial photo post here. Dont go extreme musical chair if u mind being force closed by them. I am the example they shot down,btohqsg
I think the issue is that once u are shut it leave a record and most likely cant open with them again  even if good opportunity come up,btohqsg
Yours is not musical chair leh. This is once a month thereabouts.If I‚Äôm not wrong based on what u said yours is almost daily shifting to play cutoff timings.,btohqsg
"Which is why i dont play ""punk"" with dbs/posb. Still need a bank for normal daily life transactions",btohqsg
I have never mentioned daily shifting. At most its 3 to 4 times a month. Cutoff timings played on weekends when i remember. But quarterly month end is a definite.,btohqsg
Guess bank view u as a customer who play system and dont bring enough benefit to them to tolerate your behaviour lolüòÇ.Dont think they will shut a private banking customer even if there is huge in and out monthly as long as source is legit,btohqsg
Very true again. Well said üëç,btohqsg
At least u dun jump to conclusions lol,btohqsg
U empty to zero inside? Or at least just leave $1k inside  I think they won't close the ac,btohqsg
Only earn for 5814 through delivery apps.,btohqsg
Empty to zero.. And it was a dumb move because i forgot i got 3 giro for the uob one acct n i was charged fees n i lost money,btohqsg
Wasn't it nerfed to 0.25% for 5814 last year?,btohqsg
They tarik back after few months they nerfed it  but maybe only for 5814 through delivery apps. So directly in shop payment with 5814 cannot  through apps like Deliveroo ok.,btohqsg
Where do u see that? The live T&C states that 5% for 5814 is only for Foodpanda  Grabfood and Deliveroo.https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-365cc-cashback-programme.pdf,btohqsg
Yup already edited my message before you sent lol. But I guess they didn't tarik anything. The faq got state delivery apps not changed. üò¨,btohqsg
hey all thanks for clarification! 1 more question is that does fast food still count for the $800 spend? I'm struggling to hit that tbh lol,btohqsg
Yes  still counts towards min spend,btohqsg
OK awesome thanks! new to the credit card game lol,btohqsg
This letter there is no sentence or paragraph stating that it allows appeal,btohqsg
what is this group actually for?,btohqsg
Stupid stupid stupid. Trying to gain every advantage and then kena $20 like that ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶,btohqsg
So for all those who saw the videos pls just follow chris recommendation of only moving once every quarterly n dont take it to the extreme like me. The consequence is drastic.,btohqsg
Once a month rotate is fine.Most importantly be able to provide kyc information when asked by bank.,btohqsg
lol weren‚Äôt you the one that account closure and then appeal?,btohqsg
Lol probably on their radar liao yet you still choose to do the same,btohqsg
But if i cant maximise it then i see no point still having the acct so i made the decision,btohqsg
Uob one acct is definitely a keeper in my view with all the promo and good card so i wont risk it lol,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt risk offending Uob or citi.The 2 most rewarding banks for credit card rewards now.And I won‚Äôt risk offending Uob or HSBC for banking accounts too.,btohqsg
If I must choose the most useless banks now. It would beCimbBocIcbcRHB,btohqsg
Anyone using ocbc bluechip investment portal?,btohqsg
Got... Uob nation of plunging chicken üôä promo if you are eligible... Then if you don't mind taking a bit of risk  moomoo 6.8%... These are higher than hsbc that I know of and don't need much conditions.,btohqsg
I thought the main factor is your refusal to show your proof/source of income (cos you don't have 1 and is not willing to be upfront about it)? With the recent AML case  banks are getting more uptight. When faced by customers with unknown or questionable funds  they rather earn less rather than to be implicated. I could have remembered wrongly tho...,btohqsg
Actually UOB one account no need to play musical chairs. The 4% on 150k is good enough.,btohqsg
I am quite happy with it. Moving funds here and there is tiring and risk being banned by banks for gaming the system.,btohqsg
Hi friends anyone doing digital marketing for passive income here,btohqsg
UOB offering 4% on 150K FD?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I cannot meet the min spend of 500/800 for uob one account and I do not want to put into Maribank/GXS account  what is the next no-frills bank account I can use to get more interest from my deposit?,btohqsg
ocbc 360 if u can deposit salary and balance increase by at least 500 monthly3.25% if u have less than 75k4.05% if u have 100khttps://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
Sorry one more qn  if I already have an existing CIMB acc  am I still eligible?,btohqsg
For growing small amount of cash  I leaning towards GXS as they also have debit card. Maribank doesn‚Äôt have. I used to have Trust account but their 5 x $30 requirement makes it difficult to meet the requirements,btohqsg
I cannot meet the salary deposit unfortunately:(,btohqsg
why not maribank tho? its licensed and insured too 2.7% no frills at all,btohqsg
I am trying see if there is anything better than Maribank 2.7%. Trying the squeeze more from the buck I have lol,btohqsg
But cimb 3.5% is a promotion until end Sep. Not sure if they will extend. Also do they have debit card to use together?,btohqsg
The best you can get to almost no-frills is hopping between SCB eSaver and CIMB,btohqsg
"Hi gurus. I have a use case. For ocbc 360  an new account was opened with 100k deposited.On 30june  $3.84 interest was credited but was transferred out on the same day before 9pm.On 1jul  $500 was deposited for july Save bonus.But as shown in the money insights  total bal is 150k but the change in balance is not 500$ but 400$+.Does it mean the int credit should not be xferred out? Or is there like a different ""cutoff"" timing to xfer funds out?",btohqsg
ah so they dont count the interest that they deposit until 1 july  interesting to seenever noticed this before cos i usually dont transfer out the interest  yes 1 july is monday so the problem isnt the 500 deposite,btohqsg
Sorry confused. 30june is sunday  1july is monday.,btohqsg
If you see their guide  it is usually better to check the MAB on the website,btohqsg
