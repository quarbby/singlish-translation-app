hi lads  I need some advice on points to consider between SMU and NUS cswhat I'm considering now:points to NUS:+more renowned CS degree  generally considered best in SG+deeper theoretical  technical knowledge+hall/RC+wider range of specialisations/tracks to choose+wider selection/variety of ppl to meet/connect  especially in dorm+has an alumni network-87.5 RP - little chance of scholarshippoints to SMU:+(anecdotally) curriculum comparable to NUS/NTU+seminar based teaching and small classes = development of soft skills and more focus on each student+smaller batch = closer batch+closer to home  no need for dorm+emphasis on internships and projects+global opportunities guaranteed for every student+offered LKCSP scholarship-no SMU CS student has graduated yet  risky(?) - required second major in business - ambivalent at the momentmay I know if there are any misconceptions / other good points I should consider before making my decision HAHAany help is greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Smaller = closer not necessarily good,btohqsg
Idt smu cs is risky honestly. All cs courses locally are good but NUS one is renowned for insane rigour... but whether you can apply that knowledge to the real world is another,btohqsg
Actually real world doesnt firms dont really hire CS major for their advanced applicatioms,btohqsg
Its always the Maths  Bio Chem etc major that specialise in that field they r working in,btohqsg
That get paid > CS but there arent many,btohqsg
EJ math papers were way too easy,btohqsg
If u can solve complex problem with maths modelling  learning to translate it into code isnt very difficult,btohqsg
