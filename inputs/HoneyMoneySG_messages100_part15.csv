How many credit cards do u guys own? Mainly for cashback or miles or privileges?,btohqsg
How come MCC 3 numbers? 😂,btohqsg
I think effective cashback is approximately 4.75% after deducting 3.25% for FX charge,btohqsg
Btw  it is 100% confirmed (even though we already interpretated as such from the Citibank notification).All my Citibank Cashback GROCERY spend in March 2024 only got 6% cashback (already nerfed for me from 8% to 6% on 10th March 2024) because my statement date is 10th March to 10th April 2024.,btohqsg
Yup and private commute can get 8%.,btohqsg
My statement was 5th April but I had 8% for groceries.,btohqsg
really? you count properly or not...or maybe you lucky fell into the 'transiting' calculation phase.my statement 10th april  and i am looking at it right now. Confirmed 6% only (and i only spend on groceries using Citi Cashback).^Private commute  petrol  dining and groceries transactions will earn the revised bonus cash back rates if yourstatement date falls after 31 March 2024 as bonus cash back is computed on your statement end date based on yourtotal spend amount.,btohqsg
Citi also don’t know how it worksThey give 0% bonus for my private commute  but according to TnC it should be at a revised rateGrocery - 5.8% (revised rate)Private commute 0% (old rate)I talked to about 5-6 CSO  and all reply with stupid answers like March gets old bonus rate. When I say why my grocery got the new rate (which is correct according to TnC)  they couldn’t answer and new CSO started from the beginning. I fed up and demanded to talk to product manager. Only then they acknowledged. Now waiting for my bonus 😂,btohqsg
Yes 2 tbills. Is this like a one off expense?,btohqsg
$1014.99 spending  $61.35 cashback = 6% cashback. SIGH.,btohqsg
quarterly $2 per tbill.so don't spread your eggs too much.. try to buy in big sizes  and lesser tbills,btohqsg
Quarterly service charge of $2.18 per T-bill,btohqsg
okok… didnt know this. any other fees i should take note off?,btohqsg
No need count.. I top up $800 to gift card only no other spent any way is last burst of fire.,btohqsg
how did they breakdown your cashback box as per my example?,btohqsg
Transaction fees  example if you top-up/rsp to endowus  etc. DBS charges the highest  lowest is UOB.,btohqsg
So you got $2 base and $62 bonus?,btohqsg
Ah the bill was March not April see wrongly 😂,btohqsg
hahaha.. ok ok i know you are not intentional... all good all good...,btohqsg
Because I foresee this issue from UOB nerf last time so bought earlier,btohqsg
It is still a good card for food.,btohqsg
lucky i haven't call into Citi to bang table yet,btohqsg
Now the high savings account is like ticking time bomb dunno when it will hit OCBC,btohqsg
no leh.. i might be killing off citi cashback already..using UOB Lady 6mpd for Dining/Groceries now. $2k cap i testing to see if can make it or not.I still have Maybank FnF for 8% Groceries and 5812.,btohqsg
I've already participate in the UOB dragon promo in Feb with One acct. Can I sign up new stash and join the new Big Saving Payout this round ? Anyone can advise ?,btohqsg
hi gurus- to confirm on the $500 spend on one account  currently I’m paying $800 of premium from SC debit card as I bought the endowment plan from prudential via SC.. if I would change the premium to be charged to UOB evil card it will count towards the $500 spending criteria as well rite?,btohqsg

Can i participate in 2 earmarks for rising dragan and big savings payout?,btohqsg

Then what you use for Travel and Transit,btohqsg

Amaze card charge 2% already and only can link to Mastercard. Cannot link to evol card already. Meanwhile I only use wise debit for overseas and I don't see better option clear as I still wanna clock my uob one account,btohqsg
Yea actually also can. People said exchange rate bad but still can use,btohqsg

Amaze wallet is better then youtrip usually  use mastercard to top up amaze no fee.,btohqsg
