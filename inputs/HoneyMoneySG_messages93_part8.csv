Hi all  can help to clarify if you need to use the physical amaze card to make payment or just using Google pay to earn the mastercard rewards  e.g. citi rewards online transaction,btohqsg
To qualify for webull transfer in rewards which expire tomorrow 4pm  am I too late if I submit the transfer us shares form before the expiry date since the share transfer will happen only after several business days later?,btohqsg
Side query. How to check monthly average balance in OCBC 360? I thought would need to wait till the monthly statement is out,btohqsg
amaze+crmc ok for 4mpd so long mcc not excluded (regardless physical amaze card  googlepay  online  authorised transaction),btohqsg
U need to chat with CSO to confirm.Base on info shared by community  it is based on date you click the “participation now”button. You have 21 business days to provide transfer proof to Webull.,btohqsg
Is this applicable for NTUC member only?,btohqsg
Can just use the citi reward card if you shopping in app/website. Tried on shopee and works,btohqsg
Please1.login on web( mobile app not available)2. Enter the ocbc 360 transaction summary.3. There u can see the summary.,btohqsg
Only if you received the email.,btohqsg
Hi  I do not have any credit cards  I currently earn about 45k  what cards would you recommend for me to sign up for?,btohqsg
Hi anyone here can share more on the uob acc to clear out money before 31 march so entitle for next quarter new fund top up thanks a lot,btohqsg
Hi  i i currently only have a uob one cc  no savings account. And if i open the one savings acc and topup 100k into the acc. Am i still applicable to the rising dragon promo + one acc interest?,btohqsg
If possible  get the account opened asap and register today. Else you'll be in the next month's participation.Refer to the table here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg
Uob refused my request to change my card statement month,btohqsg
Use citi rewards directly. Going through amaze results in a surcharge,btohqsg
Did you try via their Uob chat function?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Citi hospital” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
should use other cards  no more 4mpd for hospital mcc,btohqsg
You can change statement date  cannot change statement month.,btohqsg
They replied they have no control of statement date. Have to start from when the card approved.,btohqsg
On uob call with their service and this reply is on email replied back to me afterwards,btohqsg
80% of my experience on call is bad lol. Usually give wrong info. Try Chat Assist.,btohqsg
gm guys  for HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promotion for Nov 2023 one  can check when the total interest will credit into account?,btohqsg
Maybe u try call in and speak to a person easier,btohqsg
There is a POSSIBILITY that the next UOB promo will be based on 31st March's balance  so you should move out ALL your funds from the target UOB account before 31st March.,btohqsg
Probably a bit hard to get 1st  but I manage to get 2nd of the month,btohqsg
If have  move out before 30 Mar  6pm.  Definitely not 31 Mar.,btohqsg
Even for existing already enrolled this rising dragon?,btohqsg
I thought that you asked for cc statement date?,btohqsg
For EGA promo 4.6%  ref month taken from Jan 2024. I applied in FEB and got the account live yesterday. If I am aiming for march 4.6% interest  I only start the deposit on March 1st and do the 5x transfer right. Feb no need to do anything keep it $0 is it OK?,btohqsg
Yes this is a separate question together the account,btohqsg
do u guys leave account balance totally at $0?,btohqsg
one account min $1000 or will get a $5 fall below fee right?how come $10 bro?,btohqsg
so fall below fee is ADB?,btohqsg
Dear all Asking for advice regarding SIA Krisflyer - redemption booking.I waitlisted on a flight (particular time and destination) by redeeming krisflier points. but my today's search on SIA the same journey  the redemption waiting list option is even gone. flight is scheduled on 17th March2024. does this mean i better just buy commercial booking now  to avoid it might sell out?any advise?economy flight to Narita on 17th March 24,btohqsg
i don't like to see 0.00.. so leave $10 loh..can be $1 can be $8.88... individual preference I guess...,btohqsg
Am curious. Many people here very interested in the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion. And I did a brief calculation for a placement range of 20K to 200K  the p/a interest rate is 1.3+% to 1.9+%. Can I understand briefly what the hype is about ?,btohqsg
Because you are still earning normal up to 5% p.a. on the UOB account. This promotion is on top of that,btohqsg
I see thanks. So is 5% and on top of that  there is an approx 1.3+% to 1.5+%. But that additional interest rate is due to the top up of funds right which u can’t withdraw for 4 mths. I mean can just place the additional funds in FD instead? Am thinking I might have missed out on something. Since it’s locked in for 4 mths  and is additional funds top up  it works like an FD and the interest rate is 1.3%+ to 1.9+% .. ?,btohqsg
yes you missed out on what is just being discussed above.EMPTY the account before the reference date.So when participating  your account will only have $100k which earns the full 5% p.a. + lock up promo of 1.5% p.a. = 6.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Am confused. Will try digesting abit. Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Cos I think you are using 200k as your reference. The 6.5ish pa is using 100k.,btohqsg
If they are taking reference from 31st March which is a Sunday I think we should remove funds on 28th March considering 29th March is a PH and 30th and 31st March is a weekend,btohqsg

Hi bro how come 600 here  thought only need 500?,btohqsg
Thanks  I will yan jiu abit,btohqsg
If first day of the month falls on Sunday or public holiday  $500 is not enough n you will miss the save bonus. I make it simple to remember - $600. If you know the MAB formula  you can adjust accordingly. For newbie  perhaps $600 is a safer play.,btohqsg
Anyone getting spam messages from usmart?,btohqsg
