"NextInsight - Latest News (Main)JIUTIAN CHEMICAL: Riding on rising ASPs  gross marginExcerpts from UOB KH reportAnalyst: Clement HoJiutian Chemical Group (JIUC SP)High ASPs To Remain Firm As Supply Remains LimitedWe are seeing a widening of gross profitability from high product ASPs and a slower rise in raw material prices.Jiutian ChemicalShare price:9.0 cTarget:16.8  cWe do not expect any significant new production capacity for dimethylformamide and methylamine due to environmental concerns remaining at the forefront of the Chinese government’s agenda  while ample supply of methanol will put a cap on feedstock costs.Maintain BUY with higher target price of S$0.168 (from S$0.138) after re-basing our valuation year from 2021 to 2022.https://www.nextinsight.net/images/stories/Misc_2022/dmf4.22.pngWHAT’S NEW• Product ASPs continue to trend upwards in 1Q22. According to CEIC Data  the average price for dimethylformamide (DMF) recorded a 74.5% yoy spike in 2M22 to Rmb16 350/tonne (2M21: Rmb9 370/tonne).This compares with our initial estimate of Rmb10 500/tonne in 2022 for Jiutian Chemical Group (Jiutian). Historically  ASPs are typically the lowest in the first quarter  before trending up the rest of the year.• No new capacity in the foreseeable future. China’s manufacturing industry continues to see a DMF supply shortfall as applications for new capacity remain on hold without any follow-ups by the Chinese government as environmental concerns remain at the forefront of policies.No new capacity on horizon ""Even if the Chinese government gives approval for new supply  it would still require a minimum of 9-12 months for trials and further approvals  before the new capacity can come on-stream to the market.""We continue to maintain our view that any significant new increase in DMF supply will be capped  and this will support prices in 2022 and 2023.Even if the Chinese government gives approval for new supply  it would still require a minimum of 9-12 months for trials and further approvals  before the new capacity can come on-stream to the market.• Widening gross margins also coming from ample supply of methanol. Methanol prices have been kept low because of ample supply. Relative to DMF’s 74.5% yoy spike  average methanol price in 2M22 saw an increase of just 11.1% to Rmb2 893/tonne  according to CEIC Data.This implies a widening spread in gross profitability (see chart on page 2) for Jiutian Chemical  and we expect 1Q22 financials to reflect a significant scale-up in gross margin and operating leverage.• Stark improvement in 2021 financials  not seeing any slowdown. Jiutian’s 2021 net profit of Rmb310.3m (2020: Rmb174m) significantly exceeded street estimates due to the elevated product ASPs.Operating cash flow of Rmb655.8m was a marked improvement over Rmb129m in 2020  while free cash flow was also healthy at Rmb633.5m (2020: Rmb122.7m) as capex was minimal at Rmb22.3m (2020: Rmb6.3m). Furthermore  Jiutian’s balance sheet swung from an accumulated loss position (since 2009) of Rmb199.0m in 2020 to Rmb43.5m at end-21.This places the company in a better position to access credit facilities and also pay dividends going forward.STOCK IMPACT• Gross margin expansion anticipated. Averaging 19.3% in 2017-21  adjusted gross margin is expected to improve to 33.9% in 2022 (2021: 32.4%)  due mainly to higher product ASPs.This is despite higher growth in raw material cost assumptions of 2% in 2022  based on the forward curve on crude oil futures.• No impact from China’s lockdown at this point. There is currently no impact of China’s lockdown on Jiutian’s operations  which are primarily situated in Henan  Zhengzhou. Its customer base stems mainly from Henan  the surrounding provinces adjacent to Henan  namely Hebei  Shaanxi  Shanxi  Hubei  Shandong  and Anhui  and provinces in the Yangtze D[...]",btohqsg

✈️Pika World Update – 7 April 2022✈️⏰The Fed Minutes💵In a nutshell  the minutes have relatively consistent with the recent narrative of the Fed officials. Their action will be more aggressive and tightening will be sooner than later. In particular  the balance sheet run off rate is expected to be at $95 billion per month. Moreover  officials are generally very open to the 0.5% rate hike in the coming meetings which added risk off sentiments.Hopefully the market digests it progressively and volatility will starts to settle in nicely.💡Bitcoin: Here’s a catalyst💎Cryptocurrency  in general  has found its footing this month after wobbling in the sea of market correction in the prior months. Since the past week  the rally has been for a while and has helped keep Bitcoin above the $45 000 level since January. It has defended this level and attempted to hit a high of $48 000 recently.Some analysts are now looking at the Bitcoin 2022 conference  which will be held from Wednesday to Saturday in Miami. Any positive announcement could help it breaks the $48 300 level  which is the short term resistance of its 200-day moving average.Last year  at the event  El Salvador President announced the adoption of Bitcoin as their legal tenders. Hence  there is no doubt on some anticipation of a big fat good news  if any.Let’s hope for a great rally ahead and lift us. Pika World is on the cautious side of optimism.🧻First Solar: A missing tailwind🔭As we look into the clean energy sphere  First Solar stood out as it received a downgrade. However  for some investors  the downgrade foreshadowed a positive news by the Department of Commerce that it will look at a potential inquiry on solar panel imports derived from Southeast Asian producers. This should be good news for US manufacturers such as First Solar.Nonetheless  First Solar is said to have a weakening comparative technological advantage over some Chinese peers. Moreover  its efficiency on an operational scale is also relatively weakening compared to its peers. This is worsened by the supply chain woes globally.Indeed  the company has provided guidance that signals a 13% drop in its gross margin  and only a slight improvement is likely in 2023. As a result  we may not see firm pricing power and maintain a modest stance.Pika World has not initiated any new positions in the company.It is 7 April  Thursday  6.35 am in Singapore and 6.35 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week ahead!,btohqsg

so have to wait until end of april then we will know whether merger is success or not,btohqsg
as for oil  supply will still remain tight  even though reserves will be used,btohqsg
so price may increase a little  unless more drilling and more oil can be produced,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Update – 8 April 2022✈️Beyond the FedEquity markets tried to struck off the overhang of an aggressive Fed in the final trading hours despite many hawkish comments for Bullard such that the current interest rate is too low by at least 3% raising the odds of a power charged rate hike in the coming meetings.As a new earnings season is arriving for tech stocks  Pika World will be focusing on that for clues on where the market might shift gear.🧨A less market-friendly Fed🗝The FOMC minutes had given investors much to worry about. For one  the Fed is more hawkish than what market participants expect. It will have to work through the market to sell part of its $3 trillion mortgage-backed securities purchased during the pandemic.There is no concrete plan to reduce its $9 trillion pandemic and purchase  but substantial progress has been made towards such a plan. This hints at having it executed as early as the May FOMC meeting.On top of these woes is the openness to the idea by Fed officials of a 0.5% hike. The tight labour market adds uncertainty  with inflation data worsening significantly due to the recent oil shock. Consistent with our prior writing  workers' paycheque is growing slower than the inflation growth.📉Balance sheet reduction impact💊Some strategists had pointed out that the tightening of the balance sheet tends to have a more profound impact than the rate increase in this episode. This is attributed to the vast Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  that the Fed purchased during the onset of the pandemic.While there could be buyers for such MBS  most analysts believe it will not be a smooth process. The Fed's pace of such reduction possibly depends on the economy's trajectory and its implementation rate hike and quantitive tightening process.Moreover  the sector is about 1/5 of the GDP. As more people own homes than have significant exposure to the equity market  a wealth effect is strongly tied to real estate. A misstep by the Fed could spell trouble for the housing market and thus the broader economy.It is 8 April  Friday  at 7 am in Singapore and 7 pm in New York. It is the week's last trading day  and Pika World wishes all friends a monastic and fabulous weekend ahead!,btohqsg
