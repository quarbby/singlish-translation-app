Masters is simi idk from where one then he brag to everyone,btohqsg
The pj batch nearly or just hit 50% A rate for h1 econs,btohqsg
Other than that  jp econs sucks,btohqsg
what if I'm not PASSIONATE in geog but just have SLIGHTLY more interest,btohqsg
I see history notes then I see geog one I almost vomit,btohqsg
Oh he said hated jc econs so I wanted to ask why lol,btohqsg
Is look thru some a lvl econd/geog stuff,btohqsg
And see which one interest u,btohqsg
i did and geog looks easier,btohqsg
but why is the distinction rate lower than,btohqsg
"He say take econs ""if u wanna know why roads are busy at certain times of the day in cities""",btohqsg
For me I used to like geog more than econs but now itâ€™s the other way round,btohqsg
I mean cannot rly base on dist rate,btohqsg
Either teachers/sch resources not good enough  or is the students arent good enough,btohqsg
Usually (and unfortunately)  is the latter,btohqsg
ok I will come back when I have another qn,btohqsg
@jianjun21What is a good rp for promos for jp or pj?,btohqsg
Promos doesnt determine how u will do for a lvls,btohqsg
Like my base got a not,btohqsg
I guess itâ€™s because geog thereâ€™s way too much to memorise  econs thereâ€™s still quite a fair bit to memorise but it is more common sensical so once you understand a concept itâ€™s slightly harder to forget,btohqsg
must be the malthusian argument you were talking about,btohqsg
Wow I got 60ish too watafak maybe ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ,btohqsg
I need y'all to help me vet a quick email,btohqsg
I got 60 ish cos i didnt study hard enough,btohqsg
how did u use it ah btw,btohqsg
But like the way it is written,btohqsg
Either as part of the opening paragraph aft intro  or towards the end,btohqsg
Wait I got do papers however like do for doing,btohqsg
I never see oh where I wrong I want to complete,btohqsg
99.5% of jp ppl who get 60 rp will nvr hit 88.75/90 at a lvls,btohqsg
No i dont (even if i did is illegal here),btohqsg
So like wasting my own time only doing complete bollocks,btohqsg
which gp teacher is best one ah,btohqsg
Is it the war vet lololol,btohqsg
btw how do u study for h2 chem,btohqsg
I just spent a week hardcore mugging aft j1 promos during holidays,btohqsg
Then i remembered all my content for j1,btohqsg
And barely revised j1 stuff in j2,btohqsg
Everyday if i sleep in class my gp percentile is between 99 to 100% means something wrong alr,btohqsg
Tbf gp standard in jp is not very high in the sense that people like,btohqsg
they want to get a D and then go party on,btohqsg
Is not high for a reason also,btohqsg
The students cant keep up with it,btohqsg
Like if i make the paper 1% harder  fail rates will exponentially soar,btohqsg
btw got take notes in the gp lecs? I never do anything leh,btohqsg
Hence the gp department is not so good,btohqsg
I just sleep or do my own homework/revision,btohqsg
The lecs a bit like nothing make no sense to me,btohqsg
Ya they tell the info and things it's a bit no brainer,btohqsg
I think it helps a bit for students who are strugglin with GP,btohqsg
