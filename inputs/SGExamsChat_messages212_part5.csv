hiro nid some advice on whether to drop h2 econs or chem,btohqsg
It depends on what u want to take in Uni,btohqsg
if u dont want h2 chem,btohqsg
means uni u cant enter any science or chem-related course,btohqsg
dun rly hv a course in mind,btohqsg
why i said econs was cos u dont need h2 econs to study econs or econs related courses in uni,btohqsg
but is mostly engineering rite with the exception of med,btohqsg
Which he may not want to do in the first place,btohqsg
if no need i fear for any1 going polyclinics 5 yrs from now,btohqsg
later give paracetamol for cough  gg,btohqsg
wdf i can't find my new sticker pack,btohqsg
would say chem/econs both have their pros and cons,btohqsg
econs is more of logical thinking/understanding  chem is a bit content heavy/dry,btohqsg
but imo content is more heavy for econs,btohqsg
for me i found econs dry ah,btohqsg
but both is nid heavy mem work rite,btohqsg
Its literally the most relevant subject to ur life,btohqsg
No need to bump  none of our posts are bumped either,btohqsg
Like my econs tutor would say:Economics is just intuition made hard.,btohqsg
i worried the 25m essay qns gg sia,btohqsg
thn if nid application somemore i die,btohqsg
Theres almost no content diff between h1 and h2 econs,btohqsg
logically if i can master econs essay qns thn it's more worth to drop chem rite,btohqsg
The hard part about econs is how u approach the qn,btohqsg
My man literally just mentioned the 2 biggest topics in econs and said no diff,btohqsg
The difference is v small lah,btohqsg
harh thn sometimes the qn like confusing eh,btohqsg
u just finished o lvls is it,btohqsg
whether u enjoyed chem or econs more so far,btohqsg
and what u intend to do in future,btohqsg
So for econs  do u struggle more for essays or CSQs?,btohqsg
i also like u  dk what to do in future,btohqsg
high five  but my j1 chem quite shit,btohqsg
