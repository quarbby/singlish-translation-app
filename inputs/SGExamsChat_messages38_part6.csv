This is also only for leveled staff.You can be 'unleveled' and off the scale for private arrangements.Personally I don't bet on1. entering FAANG2. getting out of this scalelmao,btohqsg
Sian I think this is missing number of years needed to progress from one level to another,btohqsg
Just wanna know overall stats not individual experience,btohqsg
Ya la be realistic ma. Don't bank on reaching the upper echelons if the promotion rate is 1% right,btohqsg
I mean  you can always be a starchaser,btohqsg

what u all planning do while lockdown,btohqsg
I'm seeing that most ppl get stuck at L5,btohqsg

I'm guessing this is sv data,btohqsg
Considering the cost of living there,btohqsg
Plus cost of living of 3-6k rent a month,btohqsg
Yea dosent seem that attractive anymore,btohqsg
SG will cut the amount by 40 pct I would think,btohqsg
Start pay at 8k monthly. So 96k a year,btohqsg
u applied to poly or jc,btohqsg

6k a month is a bit much,btohqsg
Bay area is liddat one ma,btohqsg

On the other hand  maybe live further? Pretty sure lowest isn't 6k,btohqsg
learn a bit of python  and read abt investing,btohqsg
because they made it half the usual work time,btohqsg
then when i work i do ntg,btohqsg
because the mall is pretty empty,btohqsg
IDK tbh  never went to SV before obviously,btohqsg
As in 3k USD rent a month,btohqsg
Ya  means further from workplace rite?,btohqsg
