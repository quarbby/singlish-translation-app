Amazing. They look so small on the outside,btohqsg
Yea! Small on the outside  big on the inside 😂,btohqsg

What's your current and previous ride(s)?And which do you prefer,btohqsg
Bike Review - Harley-Davidson Sportster SDoes the entry-level Sportster S exemplify the Harley Spirit? 👀✅ Looks good✅ Plenty of modern amenities✅ New engine delivers more power with greater refinement (121 bhp & 125 Nm of torque)✅ Easy to ride🤔 Exhaust location is not ergonomically idealThe new Sportster S delivers greater performance  digitalisation and approachability  which will do well to win new buyers to the brand. 😋Read the full review here➡️https://bit.ly/3ICwrO9,btohqsg

Can Car dealers in cahoot to purposely bid higher price? Lack of transparency leh,btohqsg
New vezel is now cat a??,btohqsg
Not sure but possible explanations (for Cat B)1. Tesla bidding 15% above the PQP to secure for their customers. It’s stated in their contract they can bid from 5-15% from the PQP.2. Event cars from Lexus  Volvo  BMW. For Airshow  OCBC Cycling   HSBC Women Golf Tour. Need to register them then can use.3. Last min sales of Cat B > Cat A EVs,btohqsg
Yes quite a number of tesla owner bided plus 15% as they will not charge you the difference even if it is below 15% increment,btohqsg
Tesla’s model of sale really disrupting  our AD car sales landscape.,btohqsg
Why so if the coe is 100 k it will bid max to 115 k   but if it stop at 105 k   the customer only been charge 105 k,btohqsg
Old Vezel is Cat B due to BHP?,btohqsg
Actuallt I typo  it was disrupting.,btohqsg
I was taken surprised when the new Vezel is not Cat A  as if previously it isn't haha,btohqsg
I mean the ADs really have to match their bidding style alr.,btohqsg
And in turn forcing upward bidding pressure for everyone else.,btohqsg
But it’s a good change though  it’s really no frills   zero markups.,btohqsg
I would wish for all ADs to do this.,btohqsg
Cause tesla got no dealer   is the buyer bid themself haha,btohqsg
