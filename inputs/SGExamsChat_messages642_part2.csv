Not a lot of people make use of their time there  including me,btohqsg
By the time they realise they are fked,btohqsg
I mean he was sharing alot of life xp,btohqsg
I find it's v éš¾å¾— and the stories he'd tell us is like,btohqsg
Even if I hate his teaching I can never,btohqsg
It's from a critical thinking pov,btohqsg
Sure his stories make us laugh but he'd make sure at the end of the day  we'd walk out w smth new in our brain,btohqsg
i thought that would only happen in shows,btohqsg
blud rlly called me out for being absent on Tues SIA BAHAHAH ISTG he's like you messed up the full attendance!,btohqsg
No this econs teacher is honestly,btohqsg
He doubted whether I was sick,btohqsg
I can see why people walk out,btohqsg
nono in a v humourous way,btohqsg
the worst i have experienced is class too many people dozing off then cher just zao early,btohqsg
no it's like he's still talking and half of the class at the other end cmi alrd...,btohqsg
Lucky he's carefree and temper free also,btohqsg
@chemcermo also doubts your bf all the time,btohqsg
"I went "" ya I was srsly sick""",btohqsg
His Econs lessons so fun for me imo,btohqsg
And he thought I skipped it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­even if it was a joke,btohqsg
I would cmi too though ngl,btohqsg
Feels impossible to get A under his tutelage,btohqsg
They thing is they make it so obvious that they're done w his shit,btohqsg
literally two had balls of steel to ask for a break,btohqsg
Nearing the third period of the lesson,btohqsg
It's okie that's what the majority feels,btohqsg
I won't say he doesn't strictly adhere to the marking scheme,btohqsg
based on the way he'd go thru,btohqsg
Tbh maths lect tdy that's low-key me,btohqsg
He didn't even need to refer to notes or slides,btohqsg
But then I realised still got some stuff,btohqsg
Bud fr just straight up talked to us like he's having a casual convo,btohqsg
This one at least U still have decency to sit back down,btohqsg
Not even tryna hide the fact they're packing up,btohqsg
ngl that's so funny but so sad,btohqsg
The only time my class ever pulled this shit was,btohqsg
Me and my table mate genuinely felt bad cause it felt as tho in the end he was talking to a handful only,btohqsg
Cuz we decided to act like it's the end of lesson when it's beginning of lesson,btohqsg
Pack up and about to leave,btohqsg
Damn funny when he's like good morning class,btohqsg
then the cher join the chaos somemore sia,btohqsg
EH SINCE YALL LESSON END ALRD THAT MEANS I GIVE ALL THE ANSWER FOR THE THING RIGHT,btohqsg
THEN NO NEED GO THROUGH ALRD HOR,btohqsg
i didn't even pack up and leave mid lesson in undergrad,btohqsg
and his response was p cool,btohqsg
"He'd go "" did (name) say he also wanna break? Did (name no. 2) say he also needs a break""",btohqsg
He'd say it in a very carefree relaxed retired tone,btohqsg
the way he delivers it is just so fucking funny,btohqsg
"It's giving me the "" bitch I know y'all tricks   don't fuck w me altho Im old  retired ish and talk slow"" vibes",btohqsg
Yeah I have basic respect for people,btohqsg
