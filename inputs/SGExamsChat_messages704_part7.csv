So ur saying that IP kids will forget whatever they learnt in secondary school completely so it won't benefit them in the future for JC?,btohqsg
Damn didn't know theres graduation amnesia,btohqsg
Ya got volunteer tutors in places like CCs  then some like proper tuition centres with owners who are actually damn kind and will subsidise (some even completely) the tuition fees for those in low income families,btohqsg
But. Is the disadvantage huggggeee??? Like would there be a 20 or 30 RP gap just because you didn’t go to IP? No really unless you decide to use this as an excuse and lament about it all day,btohqsg
The top 2 jcs in singapore are IP dominated,btohqsg
Also got those SIV where JC students tutor kids from low income family,btohqsg
Of the top 5 jcs in singapore only one is dominantly JAE,btohqsg
based on my own observation for the past many years and students  vast majority forget what they learned in y3 and y4,btohqsg
it can be admitted via jae,btohqsg
I know of at least 3 reputable Econs tuition centres that do that  Economics at Tuitiongenius (by Mr Eugene Toh)  Econs cafe (Mr Edmund Quek)  and Jc Economics tuition (by Mr Anthony Fok),btohqsg
Ig cuz im looking at my own experience in ej,btohqsg
And most of my chs friends slacked off,btohqsg
Cuz the content was taught alr in chs,btohqsg
Problem is those are part time tutors,btohqsg
Same thing I noticed in RGS to RI and HCI to HCI,btohqsg
These are like tuition centres who charge regular students at least $90/lesson and they have a good proven track record,btohqsg
Not completely  but still won’t be TYS / A level standard. I don’t think they’re grinding tys all year round which is what you sound like,btohqsg
It will never be taught at the same intensity and depth as in JC.,btohqsg
Huh I never mentioned that they're grinding tys all year round,btohqsg
the disadvantage isn't your grades or the school  but more of the character of students in an IP school Vs lower tier jcs,btohqsg
Hwachong high 400 Nygh 400 Jae 400,btohqsg
So not saying the poor can’t access tuition  even if it’s harder,btohqsg
It was the exact same content tho,btohqsg
i rmb sending a pic here of how the y3 notes just copypasted from y5 notes,btohqsg
No  it will not be. While they have some autonomy  they cannot teach A lvl stuff. It is still very MOE controlled.,btohqsg
I know of one chs ip guy psle 260+  drop to o levels  went Acjc  a levels didn’t do well,btohqsg
Quite sad cos it’s like a huge fall from grace,btohqsg
imo you need to be good with TYS if you wanna score for the actual exams. Knowing content would do little to help with a perfect score  there’s still a lot of exposure needed,btohqsg
that means they anyhow teach lor.Which means I should not recommend anyone to CHS,btohqsg
you mean they have to dumb it down?,btohqsg
Yes and this is why the 07 kids complained when nothing from tys came out,btohqsg
Cuz they went in with that mindset,btohqsg
certain things will have similar content. Eg for H2 Physics  still have Faraday's law and Lenz's lawBut the questions are very very different,btohqsg
Cuz they taught us le chatelier and Kc/Ksp/Kp,btohqsg
And it was rhe same stuff we learnt in a levels,btohqsg
oh ic. cause my sch for atomic structure the first part about orbitals (the entire part) alr learnt in y3,btohqsg
"so many students are confusing conceptual understanding vs conceptual applications.How many will think ""I understand all the concepts but can't do the questions""",btohqsg
Even stuff like hydrogen bonding and most of the atomic structure content like spdf and IE was alr taught in CHS,btohqsg
huh le chatelier not in olvl ?,btohqsg
Eh isn't IE under periodic table,btohqsg
for my sch under atomic structure,btohqsg
Idk chs taught IE under periodic table,btohqsg
The shielding effect effective nuclear charge bla bla bla,btohqsg
Which is why hearing that like ip schs can't teach a level content,btohqsg
all of that is chem bonding what,btohqsg
i want to bond with u,btohqsg
Cuz all ip schs ik of do infuse some forms of a level content,btohqsg
H2 Maths is easier to see.CHS sure teach inequalities in y3 y4  many schools do.Try inequalities at H2 level,btohqsg
My hwachong high friend say nygh and hwachong high trying to change the syllabus to make it more similar to O level,btohqsg
Yeah I was talking mainly at chem and physics tbf,btohqsg
