Sorry I got a qn to ask but not sure if it is relevant. I saw Chris talking about CPF funds  just wondering does increasing OA funds help increase HLE limit?,btohqsg

hi  guys. about nets pay  i saw some hawker center qr code has nets pay icon  but after i download nets app i don't see any button to scan a code. may i ask if there is any other app?,btohqsg
In any case if I am at max 80% LTV for HLE  whatever balance amount I will have to pay through OA or cash right? Will HDB limit the price of the unit I can buy?,btohqsg
Its called MSR - Mortgage Servicing Ratio,btohqsg
80% LTV is based off the purchase price of the unit  that's the max u can loan  but your 30% MSR dictates your HLEYour HLE can go as high as 80% of the HDB's LTV,btohqsg
Also do take note that the remaining lease of the flat must be enough for you to reside there until you are 95 years old  if not  HDB will pro-rate the CPF OA usage as well as HDB Loan based off how many years you are off from 95,btohqsg
The saving plan from insurance is it good?,btohqsg
Any idea if the HLE is really based on monthly salary or also take into account gross annual salary? Because I am on like a 15 to 16 month package so my monthly salary actually doesn‚Äôt tell the entire story.,btohqsg
When you apply for HLE  you can fill up the monthly salary portion by annual salary divided by 12 months  HDB will then ask for supporting documents and you can just show your payslips  any contracts stating your pay or otherwise & basically just justify your higher salary.. HDB normally calls you or emails you if they don't understand anything,btohqsg
FYI  now's a good time to apply for HLE.. Valid for 6 months. During busy periods don't expect replies from HDB so soon,btohqsg
Ah shit  I fill in my actual monthly salary not the annual divided by 12.,btohqsg
u can write in :D I have utmost respect for the officers handling the cases but when they're very busy....... it's so hard to get a response üòÇ,btohqsg
But I also submitted 15 months cpf contribution history,btohqsg
if the HLE is based off your 15 month package then you're good to go  if not you'll have to write in,btohqsg
Ok then I see how much are they willing to loan before I decide if I need to appeal,btohqsg
all the best! first house is always the most nerve-wracking but also the most memorable Lol,btohqsg
