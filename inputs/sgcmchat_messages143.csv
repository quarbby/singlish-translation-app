Hi all  does anyone know for evo x is the asc suppose to be on or off?,btohqsg
Idt it‚Äôs supposed to be off,btohqsg
I mean u can turn it off or on it just depends on what uw do,btohqsg
Whats the right way to on it press once or press and hold for 3secs??,btohqsg
But idk how to turn it back on I forgot edi,btohqsg
For now just normal driving i guess havent had the time to go sepang latelyü§£,btohqsg

I mean u turn off or on doesn‚Äôt matter la is js how uw drive lo,btohqsg

ASC will oni save u if u slip i think,btohqsg
Errrr HAHAHA I dun drive Evo X paisei,btohqsg
HAHAHA isok i wait for someone who drives evo x reply to me,btohqsg
majority say asc off is better for performance driving,btohqsg
but asc is useful in the rain,btohqsg
Basically if iw go drifting i offü§£,btohqsg
if u hold ASC down for 3 sec  it will deactivate the AYC brake control function,btohqsg
How do i activate it tho,btohqsg
ask the evo owners gc la bro better HAHAH,btohqsg
if u turn it off  you will still get S-AWC like older evo with AYC ddont have traction control but still have cpntrol of AYC  S-AYC etc. By holding for 3 sec  then everything off so no ASC and traction control active computer controlABS but I think u shold still get the standard ABS,btohqsg
