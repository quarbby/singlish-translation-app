"here's my take on it - > ""Return to Normal"" - Jerome Powell.  This is a loaded statement. Normalcy means that value take precedence over growth as value is what drives the economy rather than promises and faith. Value here also comes with fine prints. With Inflation  prices are expected to go up; Prices of goods where an increase of price would not harm the price",btohqsg
https://finance.zacks.com/risks-electric-utility-stocks-8245.htmlAccounting for inflation   the reason why utility stocks (i.e water and electrcity) would be crippled would be due to increased cost of produciton while not being able to increase prices due to regulation,btohqsg
Shipping and Oil will  be affected   but the degree at which they are affected would be the rate at which the economy recovers ( proxy of inflation )  This is so as the economy recovers  demand for goods and services will increase. Oil would be needed to power the transportation  shipping is needed to fulfill the demand in good. Hence   the degree in which inflation negatively affects companies that enable fulfillment of the economy's demand and supply will be capped,btohqsg
