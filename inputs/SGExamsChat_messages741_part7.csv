Singapore never gave a shit about historical architecture until like the 2000s,btohqsg
ill get tilted as hell @ the dancers outside smu,btohqsg

My cousin is a dancer at ntu  every so often they go mbs,btohqsg
I saw a group of tourist take the Red bus before,btohqsg
so it's safe then they let their kids run wild lor,btohqsg
cause they can't even go into the uni campus,btohqsg
Like I’m into old architecture and heritage buildings  and I know that the people around me hold that place close to their heart as they made many memories that they could cherish there. My old GP teacher visited the old NLB very frequently during his childhood and he said he was rly sad to see the building go. Unfortunately for me  I never got to see the building for myself since it was closed even before I was born,btohqsg
afaik most unis aren't open campus,btohqsg
Before they literally had a tour bus of just k1 kids come to NTU,btohqsg
but their hall is quite sad leh,btohqsg
bully pretend to be friends with you in order to know more secrets about you for further bullying,btohqsg
"the thing is ppl keep saying ""consider the non big 3 unis"" but NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO DO BUSINESS OR TECH RELATED STUFF yes they offer more courses but its not the one we want",btohqsg
You saw it before in person?,btohqsg
The only other brick building I can think of from that era is the McDonald house,btohqsg
they have this thing that u need to wake up 6am to self study,btohqsg
when the other unis start offering life sci/zoology/biosci THEN WE TALK,btohqsg
No but pictures tell a thousand stories,btohqsg
suss got so many non biz or tech courses,btohqsg
the study time in china is mad,btohqsg
SIT for poly grad that cannot get in NTU NUS SMU,btohqsg
yea ik i was just pissed because alot of ppl like,btohqsg
idt any sg uni offers it as an undergrad major :///,btohqsg
What is the next heritage building to be torn down?,btohqsg
Its easier to enter for poly grad for SIT,btohqsg
they market it to be this way iirc,btohqsg
closest thing is the zoology mods in nus chs,btohqsg
There’s many that have gone recently and would be going soon  and I can’t think about them at the top of my head. But I can’t rly think of any rly historically significant old buildings being torn down  most of them are just being torn down due to en bloc or acquisition by the govt,btohqsg
ngee ann poly got what to eat,btohqsg
i kinda wanna do postgrad overseas,btohqsg
because i really wanna do like animal related further studies,btohqsg
closest thing to a major in disney because nus has disney mods,btohqsg
But for me I’m glad that some Dakota crescent blocks were preserved,btohqsg
but idt its feasible in sg,btohqsg
Most are hdbs  empty and deserted,btohqsg
but i know some ppl could went for NTU  choose SIT coz he wanna score 5.0,btohqsg
i mean we haveto make do with what we have,btohqsg
like the big fish inside the small pond,btohqsg
Closest thing to a sleeping in NTU is NTU NIE sleeping mods,btohqsg
closest thing to becoming a voyeur is being a nus student,btohqsg
SIT depends as the external ones they don't moderate one at all,btohqsg
Yeah. Then for condos  many brutalist architecture structures have also been demolished quite frequently. Pearl bank is one example  though it’s nice to see Golden Mile Complex preserved,btohqsg
no bell curve  have moderation from what i know la,btohqsg
The lift there also original from the 50s,btohqsg
means if whole class score range from 50-55 u jus get C or smth,btohqsg
I know Digipen dont have at all,btohqsg
