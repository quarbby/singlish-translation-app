My car idle at traffic goes up to 60%,btohqsg
Don't know if yours has that,btohqsg
Like on the lufi engine %,btohqsg
R u sure u have a lufi,btohqsg
idle  on aircon its normal for the rev's to drop a bit,btohqsg
voltage also should drop a little,btohqsg
Was wondering who today havent send picture,btohqsg
Time to get a lufi for your car hahahahaha,btohqsg
It doesnt have engine load parameters,btohqsg
I dreamt of someone gifting me a lufi. Then I woke up. And now I see lufi first thing here. Jesussssss,btohqsg
Wait... What does the engine % means?,btohqsg
I'm getting my lufi up this Saturday,btohqsg
It says engine L % which sounds like engine load,btohqsg
buy liao put at home first,btohqsg
Well if aircon can load until 60% is quite scary haha,btohqsg
I tell you   buy the wheel and throttle and lufiThan buy racing game at home play can liao,btohqsg
lufi canâ€™t use on swift also ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Wah this Sunday got car meet.,btohqsg
I think organizer might be a young kid,btohqsg
First picked family day afternoon at a carpark with no amenities,btohqsg
He is in this group lol,btohqsg
I heard they are mainly spotters.,btohqsg
now organising meets is the trend,btohqsg
Too many meets all after covid excited,btohqsg
Car owners very chuan. So Many meets to go,btohqsg
Must be like me. Host weird weird meets then fun. :3,btohqsg
If it can be i park go brunch and chloe go attend i dont mind,btohqsg
our ages got range ah   some 21+ some young,btohqsg
at first they say they want host at semb park so i jst agree now i myself need handle ðŸ˜­ the rest all silent,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with young just thatâ€¦ it wont occur to you about family day and stuff,btohqsg
last time cars & kopi was like every 2nd Sunday of the month or something like that,btohqsg
now i need decide if sat or sun then host ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Yea true. Organising a huge meet need a lot to consider. If not i also won't take months to finally come up with a meet.,btohqsg
The cars and coffee formula works because family can involve which means the father or mother who is the driver wont get in trouble with spouse,btohqsg
Abandon spouse and kid on sunday daytime to go car meet. That is a cost that cannot be counted,btohqsg
thanks for the info bro  iâ€™ll discuss with the other organisers,btohqsg
yall think sunday or sat better?,btohqsg
or jst postpone to next next weekend,btohqsg
No correct answer here. Every individual got plans,btohqsg
anyday for me so long advance say i can plan,btohqsg
In my case saturday got my kidâ€™s classes,btohqsg
Meets mostly on Friday or Sat night better. Because Sunday is family day. If night  Monday ppl got work.,btohqsg
and the cars and owners that turn up at cars & kopi are a different crowd. more matured owners. less havoc.,btohqsg
Daytime is always tricky. So again it boils down to having it at a place where ppl can also do stuff,btohqsg
Honestly i feel that car meets are about making new friends and meeting friends,btohqsg
Like if u did it at ecp. The wife and kids can go macs or playground,btohqsg
But if spotters start to host,btohqsg
I feel like car meet is better from 7 PM onwards or sum,btohqsg
Kinda feel like an excuse for spotters to gather all the cool cars to take photos,btohqsg
They host doesn't mean we should go,btohqsg
