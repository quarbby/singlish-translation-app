Client think ur a Mama shop isit? üòÇ,btohqsg
I gave him cheaper by 2 dollars,btohqsg
I too lazy to cancel thru cs,btohqsg
He say he and his friend share the fee  then say he student all. I laze ah bro,btohqsg
Ask me lesser by 5 I say max 2 LOL,btohqsg
lalamove going to IPO soon btw,btohqsg
the missions also bullshit one  must be on same day to clock  if mission is for sat and you take a scheduled job today for next day Sat  its no-count LOL,btohqsg
Huh how come you got mission,btohqsg
Proof. Using etherscan to validate time of picture taken (aka not photoshopped lol),btohqsg
Thats why I already said lalamove is using algorithms to target people with incentives and jobs...,btohqsg
He want 2 give u more  hoped u can accept,btohqsg
Ytd morning   I told 1 guy my back seat not for u to put your dirty carton boxes  who will pay me for the cleaning of my backseats due to your dirty carton boxes.Then Ytd evening   I told another guy   my backseat not for passengers to sit   because I am lalamover.  Only for boxes to be sent üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ.I only deliver items in my car boots.  Don't come dirty my backseat üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
So many customers assume the front seat   back seat and boots are theirs to abuse after paying less than 20$ for a lalamove car order.  WTF are these people thinking.The dimensions stated how many cm by how many cm means how many.  Exceed then shld use a van or mpv. There are several drivers spoil such dimensions and items limitations for car orders. Behaving like labours who can't think and go by the rules.The customer told me other drivers can fetch for him   I told him then he shld find that driver to send for him again.  On the spot I took his things down and assist him to cancel.  Don't abuse my car.,btohqsg
If want to fetch passengers or several heavy boxes  why not go do grab or gojek.,btohqsg
All should take a piece of his actions and implement.I do too!! Otherwise pay an extra $10. And I‚Äôve had people who refuse to that arrangement and I said goodbye.,btohqsg
Ask them if they all weigh max 25kg. ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Another question is how about the entrance fee . I know lala vehicle is free for enter . If they take grab need to be add in right,btohqsg
At 5:14pm on a Saturday is at least $30+ to $39 for grab + entry fee6 seater $40+,btohqsg
Lesson learned. Next time I call lala mpv too ü§£,btohqsg
Hopeless  Sentosa cove somemore  really cheapo till the maximum until Dunoo how to say,btohqsg
Cheapo  kanchong; kiasu  characteristic of Singaporean,btohqsg
Sinkie abuse sinkie.  Pay some money on a platform assume they own the car and start with their own narratives.  Siao. They can't read the dimensions for car delivery.  Suddenly they turn themselves into delivery parcels. Let's watch how they abuse as time passes.  More and more anyhow lol,btohqsg
In this case strictly speaking   any lalamove drivers without fetching passengers license may end up in trouble,btohqsg
Now customers use llm order with their own wish never read through the usage. Drivers become their personal maid,btohqsg
People will still take these orders.,btohqsg
Anyway the cash out for LLM usually is Wednesday 12am be in or end of Wednesday kind?,btohqsg
He guys how long will the 70$ deposit be transferred into bank after deactivation of account,btohqsg
usually in the middle of the day,btohqsg
Return of the western union scammer‚Ä¶.lol,btohqsg
I don't think llm would care about it,btohqsg
Back in my original workplace (hosp),btohqsg
Guys check with you all ah,btohqsg
How come I see other country llm got additional door to door charge,btohqsg
Because people will still take the job even if shit price,btohqsg
Any advise where to park if deliver to mbs?,btohqsg
The 16% commission deduction is fake,btohqsg
Mine got deducted at about 18.47%,btohqsg
Received an order at $27.5 and only got back $22.42,btohqsg
Mbs is $14/hr. U tell customer go driveway collect from u,btohqsg
Do until shag   why bother this type?  Each box is like 20-30kg. Even banglah may not want to do. Obviously need another helper. Cb want tekan ppl till go hospital this type. Those big boxes best 2 ppl load up the van.  Take care of spine. Don't bcos of such ppl sustain a perm injury,btohqsg
They still told me they book the same yesterday,btohqsg
Same story and excuses they give.  Even they did maybe the driver in hospital now. Not worth risk your health. All van drivers take care.  Don't because of small bucks lose your health.  Heard too much of such stories.  One time is enuf to suffer whole life due to back injury. Loading up van is different from lifting weights as slight turning of body maybe required.  Those turns can be lethal to lower back. Slowly   I seen women doing van job   she rolled big boxes up when I tried to help her,btohqsg
Yesterday I also kena like you  book MPV. But weight size is definitely 1.7M van type. So I negotiated with her ( China aunty ) to top extra $20 up to match 1.7M van pricing ( inclusive of surge ) as per on the app. ü§£,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt hesitate to report on Foreign Workers working on delivery platforms. Just go ahead so that they don‚Äôt abuse the platform and take any form of jobs.,btohqsg
I only reported 2  one of whom over the weekend. Infront of my face take motorcycle job. Straight away take photo of him holding his phone and his face. Then take photo of him running into his lorry with the delivery. Good luck to him.,btohqsg
Such cheapo customers still exist cos of cheapo drivers who condone their actions!,btohqsg
Guys I always ask for picAnd if the pic shows that you can't handle as one manIt's either they top up for additional manpower or cancelDon't get angry high bp over such Customer,btohqsg
Good luck and stay safe man,btohqsg
Tot only car and below need go up and take from cust,btohqsg
Door to door according to lala,btohqsg
Gogo got option to be mover or not,btohqsg
LLM stated van driver as mover with base price $26 for 1.7m and $32 for 2.4m van  GOGOX with the option for customer to carry items themself for van $25. You tarhan or notüò°,btohqsg
Hello all. Just curious to know biker 1 week with lalamove can earn how much if I work from 9am to 2am 6 days?,btohqsg
Just kemna one cheapo. Pick up durian car job. End up see 2 heavy basket. Told customer this is not car job. Straightaway customer cancel,btohqsg
The shop say they didn't put in the order. Someone else not part of the job,btohqsg

Dunno leh. Contacted customer name as ah boy.but person answer is lady.,btohqsg
First time I hear such things. ü§£,btohqsg
Then when I reach the shop .. the phone number become unavailable. Then customer contact led me via the app. I said it's 2 big baskets and heavy. Straightaway she cancel,btohqsg
Maybe it's my Xiaomi redmi phone,btohqsg
Immediate filter only works for those with lalabag registered.,btohqsg
Not ordered by her but she can cancel the job??? Weird.,btohqsg
Not her. Someone else who was not there,btohqsg
Wow   which logistics company so power sia ü´°,btohqsg

Lol . This news from Malaysia. Same   everywhere got this kind pattern of user üòÆ‚Äçüí® not only in Singapore,btohqsg
LLM slash price everywhere  drivers don't want to do,btohqsg
But there‚Äôll still be desperate drivers who will still do it. Thus giving LLM the chance to capitalise on it.,btohqsg
It is because it is their bread and butter. Their FT job. Still need to put food on the table and roof over their heads.,btohqsg
Or sometimes it‚Äôs on the way home‚Ä¶..just take even if it‚Äôs $10 profit.,btohqsg
Usually to engage lalamove to transport a 3 feet new fish tank and cabinet.. which option should we use? Tks,btohqsg
Fish tank better to engage proper mover ba.. 3 1.5 1.5 or 322?,btohqsg
Ok. Tks. 90 x 45 x 45cm,btohqsg

Hi guys newbie here..how long does lala move need for them to credit the money into our acct?,btohqsg
3 to 9 days. The money is credited on the first Wednesday after the first sunday(2330) after the cashout request.,btohqsg

But for this to happen the drivers must all be united,btohqsg
Healthcare is a good exampleOur nurses v desperate (especially FT  so any shit rates they also accept),btohqsg
Only during covid the govt ll gotta pay more to entice the good and experienced ones to come back in,btohqsg

Anything below lorry no such thing man,btohqsg
Van is for goods not for humans to hitch,btohqsg
U always fetch ppl meh. U passed the PDVL test to fetch already? Else at own risk leh,btohqsg
The real issue is if u don't have PDVL u cannot fetch.  Later kena. Don't play play,btohqsg
Some motorbike deliveroo pending 8months lol.  Actually LLm quite OK in update particulars and admin stuffs.  The problems really lies with how the customers abuse the app,btohqsg
LLm close case champion.  Ask for compensation also case close.  Customer complain nonsense also case close lol.  Only police case they cannot close,btohqsg
But since u van the item can be really heavy.  He want follow ask him help u tgt in loading up the items to van.  Else later can injured.  Also can ask him look after his items while sitting at the back inside the van. If u don't have PDVL don't let anyone check or know can liao  since he at the back inside the van.,btohqsg

This type go Prada LV shop anyhow spend.  But their other face is abuse hardworking delivery pax. Let them go pay more for moving service,btohqsg
Ya exactly . Llm attract a lot of cheapos,btohqsg
That's why LLm allows us to see a lot of truths abt Singaporeans.  They simply abuse to the max. These customers somehow forget the drivers are the boss.  We are nt employed by LLm.  We are partners. LLm and customers better know that it's our wheels that kept this platform alive.But all we see these days are customers who assume n treat us like cheaper version of grab drivers. LLm as our partners did anything to prevent this?,btohqsg
Every time I want to see,btohqsg
How Singaporean abuse Singaporean in monetary way,btohqsg
I open LLM and LLM telegram,btohqsg
Never fail to satisfy my craving  YUMMMYYY,btohqsg
They will abuse the system   Singaporeans grow up with the mindset of that,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt have compassion due to upbringing,btohqsg
Can't cover anything ...price is so low and you get to carry double the amount...,btohqsg
One custom insist I must bring trolley for car job.I told him   max weight is 20kg for car orders.  U can carry 20kg items with my hands   why need a trolley.  Also asked him who gave him the idea that lalamove car drivers must have trolley.  Ask him try mpv or van for trolley service.He nothing to say. I ask him he want to cancel or don't want cancel he decide. Told him I have a weighing scale. Max 20kg means 20kg,btohqsg
Inside the box is what never state.  What if it is iron bars.  Knn,btohqsg
ü´° if all drivers like you lalamove will be a way better platform  no abuse no bullshit,btohqsg
Drivers want anyhow eventually get more and more shit customers and soon lalamove will also cut the fare. Only such drivers ownself to lose out.  Gogox btw  any help to carry items is chargeable. For Gogox  only drive   including van.  Want carry then pay.  That's the rule. Then.....  Customers realise   so abuse lalamove,btohqsg
i kena one order  4 big boxes  not sure if exceed 20kg,btohqsg
my poor mazda 2 boot full,btohqsg
Dimension for cars exceed le. Tell the fella pay extra else he can rebook mpv,btohqsg
now never do liao  along the way then do,btohqsg
Sometimes I let them decide   pay more to me or to waste time book another mpv if over weight or dimension lol. They want waste time then up to them.,btohqsg
Most customers betting on lalamove drivers are desperate so keep abuse. So I stick by lalamove rules   measure weight and dimension.  Exceed either pay me extra or they can wait for next mpv or van driver  I don't abuse. Just follow rules.  This the way to up the fare in long run,btohqsg
8boxes of liquor bottles.  This type is illiterate or act blur abuse?  He cannot read car orders dimensions and weight limit.  Who are the drivers who gave him the idea that this is lalamove.  The customer completely showing zero respect to our wheels.Maybe accept it and go fk him   abuse his time lo. Like after 25mins tell him oh I miss out the part trolley needed. He needs to cancel lol,btohqsg
I know there are customer in this chat.  So if u guys abuse us  we have our own legit ways to waste your time,btohqsg
They can't bear to play by the rules and pay the extra few more bucks.  OMG,btohqsg

Lalamove Cs why use wadsapp to contact u?  They so jialat use own HP number. Sounds to me like some customer. Either from restaurant or the food receipent. Show his HP to lalamove office.  Tell then compensate u for wasted trip down.  U be compensate half of order fee,btohqsg
Look at how they treat us,btohqsg
Nvm gonna make it big big on internet,btohqsg
Damn jialat. Sounds like ah beng ah Lian,btohqsg

"Her last two words ""as if"" already tell all that she trying play her own game with u.  Means she isn't going to work by the rules. LLm higher management got to know and look into this pax.  Else will she use her keyboards to tekan drivers like how the customers tekan us?",btohqsg

"I have been seeing a some vans with "" The lorry"" advertisement. Is it a new platform for vans? Maybe can earn triple more than LLm and ggv rather than 20-30 per trip for van services. Just maybe",btohqsg
Lalamove review is 4.8Want to bluff who??,btohqsg
The lorry has v bad reviews,btohqsg
Wow that‚Äôs a really bargain price given the time.,btohqsg
Hi anyone encounter cash out failed ?,btohqsg
Next time pick them then stack orders. According to T&C got 1 hour to drop off. Lol,btohqsg
All Lalamove drivers here Ah ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm relatively new to Lalamove but fellow member be careful when taking job i kenna scam $160 while taking on a job from the application,btohqsg
Tio Liao then saw this telegram ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Ohhh dear‚Ä¶..you bought the stuffs?  Or you transferred the money to them?,btohqsg
This one always pop up at night.,btohqsg
Just remember that  we‚Äôre working to earn. So if there‚Äôs any job that requires us to pay or purchase somethin upfront for the customer  and with a hefty payout amount  it‚Äôs highly likely a scam. Just ignore those jobs man.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs aite for now‚Ä¶..move on and stay alert.,btohqsg
Cannot leh  I also do how to report,btohqsg
So the scammers are the shop owners ? Since we buy it and couldn‚Äôt deliver,btohqsg
@parableofsoweris it you use money to buy already they MIA on you?,btohqsg
Well  that‚Äôs a good question. But I doubt so tho.,btohqsg
First you call them it‚Äôs our practice right they won‚Äôt answer it‚Äôs a local mobile then I text he replied job is confirmThen he will contact you using overseas number it‚Äôs the same person as the one who orderHe will first ask you buy items like food etc etcAfter that he will ask you go 7-11 buy stuff this is where the scam comes inHe will give you a QR code and ask you to top up for him once this top up is doneHe wil delete all his conversation with you and when you reach the destination to drop off that address is a fake address,btohqsg
My thought was I‚Äôm working for Lalamove and this is the job I get after I look for them they deny everything,btohqsg
Thank you it‚Äôs ok la just honestly Lalamove seriously cmi,btohqsg
Just be careful lor since you guys know how this scam works,btohqsg
No problem we should share for me I just work and work didn‚Äôt imagine while working for a platform they actually allow this scam to happen and they Pua bodoh as if it‚Äôs our own liability to have kenna scam and when they are the source provider,btohqsg
I really hope something can be done to get back your money. And lalamove should do their jobs in preventing such jobs scams from taking place.,btohqsg
Sorry man bro. But thanks for sharing tho. Always wondered how they execute the scam part.,btohqsg
Lalamove is as good as any other platform. BS. Make use of them like they do you.,btohqsg
LLM should verified every customer with their personal details like address in ID and contact with sms code verification to ensure registration is real person so that anything going wrong can deal with them  this will eliminate fake order,btohqsg
Even if they dont verify  such orders should be via card payment only. That would be safer,btohqsg
omg i just kena from this scam also,btohqsg
when i reached the destination  there is another lala move driver here also,btohqsg
we both kena scammed by the same person,btohqsg
now then i saw this chat üò≠,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  did you guys report police?,btohqsg
we called the police and they came down to the address,btohqsg
then i went to google the slide reload thing is actually one way to remit money also,btohqsg
Hopefully they can retrieve the money,btohqsg
Ohhhh my‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôs no wonder these scammers keep trying so hard everyday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
1 out of 10 are still vulnerable. And don‚Äôt see the whole idea about the requests.,btohqsg
Honestly they should just stop  purchase service,btohqsg
can purchase service but must credit order not cash order,btohqsg
Dont forget the ahlong orders also.just be careful.,btohqsg
Anyone have lalamove cs whatsapp number?,btohqsg
Just be careful of this marcus idiot.,btohqsg
Dont know what the hell are doing also,btohqsg
I don't think they will reply you,btohqsg
How to check that it‚Äôs ahlong order?,btohqsg
If let say they give you the sender address  and the receiver address is incomplete then its a ahlong order..,btohqsg
Ohhh  okay. Thank you for the explanation.,btohqsg
My past 3 years doing lalamove  this is the 5th time i encounter this.,btohqsg
LLM cannot continue anymore  never protect driver customers always right  cut driver price  CBD open all drivers die  now carpark expensive some building no grace. In future satellite systems implemented how to survive?,btohqsg
They Dont care lah sure got people take,btohqsg

Agreed. Always have new blood come in to this platform. They no worry about it üòø,btohqsg
Mangyaring ipaalam sa akin kung sinuman ang nakakakilala sa driver na ito. Kung hindi niya ako mabigyan ng numero ng telepono para makipag-ugnayan sa kanya  nawala ang order ko nang hindi ito naihatid kagabi.,btohqsg
LLm is for all drivers to see the stingy and abusive side of Singapore users.  It is a one sided platform for1)tekan drivers2)illegal fetching of people without PDVL3)for cultivating abusive nature of humans in singaporeüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I encounter ppl delivering drugs before.  I reported to police. Eventually wasted hrs for statements,btohqsg
A platform even drug users use sia. Knn,btohqsg

Yes all anyhow.  Get 3ppl sit on van with heavy loads travel 25km.  Pay $28 . Simi LJ,btohqsg
LLm has turned sg into pukhet island.  All anyhow.,btohqsg
Quick question  is it normal that you can't cash out fully to the last cent?,btohqsg
Erms no. Like $50.12 you can only cash out $50.10 and not $50.12. Is it norm?,btohqsg
21 cartons $26 only  so cheap,btohqsg
You all so cuteIf the job pays too low or has stupid cocks want to sit in car or van which is not part of the goodsDon't take laAiyooWhy take then complainThis kind of clowns I let IMH ambulance ferry,btohqsg

This is an unofficial chatMost of us add by chanceAlot don't use telegram chat alsoSo can't blame alsoLalamove didn't make a chat for all drivers to sulk  share info also,btohqsg
Guess we will continue to let customers and Lalamove to make use of.,btohqsg
With all the rising petrol  car rental and COE  please wake up guys,btohqsg
We have to show that it is us  drivers  who make or break lalamove,btohqsg
You are 100% correct ...drivers are making money for them yet got to be bullied at both ends..,btohqsg

This scam take place as in he also got local number,btohqsg
Scammer is almost everyday on Lalamove app yet Lalamove is doing nothing about it. Only asked us to be more vigilant,btohqsg
They shouldn‚Äôt even be in the app in the first place for goodness sake,btohqsg
How much hard earned money has lost,btohqsg
Well tbhThis job came from themThey are the one who allow that trolley icon there and within the app itself told you shopping fee is about so and so they actually even allow such text to exist,btohqsg
Means the actually honor the. Shopping before hand,btohqsg
Is normal. That cent cannot cashout,btohqsg

Oops  illegal? Idk üòñ. If illegal then no lah~ no guts üòÖ,btohqsg
Later do and then kena caught. üç¶ Best don‚Äôt even try. Nowadays license not cheap lehh.,btohqsg
?? LLM can ferry people?? Not just goods?,btohqsg
I would add on transport fare from grab and charge them.,btohqsg
If not they can lie in the boot since they are considered goods,btohqsg
If I know anyone I dislike fetch ppl passengers with any form of platform without PDVL   I report the driver to LTA üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
We can't add on anything on LLM app right? Even extra waiting time also need CS right?,btohqsg
"One day can I book LLm say I want to be passenger.  Then if that driver fetch me   half way I ask for his license to fetch passengers   don't have means I make call on spot.  Catch them red handedüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Not just him in trouble   LLm also in trouble anotüòÖüòÖ. Rules are rules.  Drivers misuse LLm as a platform do cheaper grab must be"" treated ""by LTA.All drivers beware   I maybe the next customer remarked"" can I be a passenger? "" gonna catch uüòÇüòÇüòÇ",btohqsg
Cs may nt approve of those charges cos LLm Cs priority is customers,btohqsg
If this got order number   tmr I free can make police report anot? Entice drivers without PDVL take passengers.,btohqsg
Hi Pls take note.  LLm already been abused by scammers including drug Traffickers a few years back.  Those say like pay u extra but in cash one   beware.,btohqsg
If not then just cancel and waste everyone‚Äôs time,btohqsg
Not just that. Those selling e cigarettes also using LLM to send over their products. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
So long no one chat with her?,btohqsg
2men plus a car plus 30mins.  $18. Is this Bangladesh,btohqsg
Well to solve the case if it‚Äôs simple even brainless can do it they willOr else if the case is consider major they mayBut this right they didn‚Äôt even bother wanting to take the QR code provided to at least stop or trace further on so easy and simple suk it up Lor if not you need to spend you utmost quality time to just chase and chase,btohqsg
Look out for this person  taking advantage of ‚Äúcar / van system‚Äù . Put car but flower arrangement can only fit in Van   lalamove cs also useless   say ‚Äú should be able to fit in car  you settle yourself I‚Äôm ending the chat now‚Äù.  Tired of lalamove alr,btohqsg
How to fit in car? Unless I really stupid dk how,btohqsg
Ask customer to cancel order or top up the difference from car to van,btohqsg
Take photo show lalamove staff in ubi office  CS useless,btohqsg
Die die dw top up. üò≠ end up just take cause need money lol,btohqsg
Don't do that  customer know you lanlan next time he do again,btohqsg
I only take car job when I heading to that location or going home otherwise not worth it,btohqsg
Im so sad‚Ä¶ offered to go his house and collect cash and help buy for him but he cancelled.. üòû,btohqsg
I want to help people buy thing but more helpful drivers out there üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya la  its because of people like that customer know you LL..so they will keep doing this,btohqsg
Then they Are Part Of Syndicate tooüòÇ,btohqsg
if u know how to report is better to make llm price like is not helping all delivery drivers platform at all now most drivers take order due to no choice.,btohqsg
Rules are rules cannot fetch passengers without PDVL means cannot lol. Eventually LLm kena one,btohqsg
Non Pdvl can legally take 2 rides a day  that's what grab hitch is based on. Also it's not the llm platform that is breaking the law  it's the driver doing the hitch.,btohqsg
all got no choice llm driver like become slaves ready to customer.customer paying everything they can do but go no choice just ok open pants and swat have to if being ordered by them.,btohqsg
LLm is allowing customers to abuse the platform  LLm will surely get involved. Actually LLm Drivers with cars aren't allowed to fetch passengers. Even for van it's at own risk,btohqsg
"So u one of the drivers customer say anything u also go fetch and do for them? Never follow LLm guidelines? What do u mean no choice.  Or u an abusive customer trying make drivers"" no choice ""lol. U wanna try me as ur driver see how I make an abusive customer no choice?  They will lose loads of their time.....  I don't mind losing mine.  Human pride and dignity don't just worth those 20$.",btohqsg
We all have a choice here   joining lalamove is our choice as well. So there's no such thing as no choice only submissive,btohqsg
Depends how u talk to Cs.  U need give them dimensions of the items.  Don't show pic first.  Your pic showing ur van easily fit in.  So Cs tgt hand in hand cheat ur labour and van rental/instalment.,btohqsg
Thank you! Next time if happen again I will give dimensions,btohqsg
Remember always have measuring tape with you,btohqsg
"Don't take next time.  U are spoiling this customer.   U corner the customer into either1) they gonna follow LLm guidelines N pay .2) waste their time wait for next driver.I normally tell them"" Sry I can't fetch your item till u change to mpv or van job.  Cos once I take the picture LLm knows it is bigger than the dimensions cars are allowed to take.  Or u want to cancel it to wait for next driver to come and take this risk?  "" I am not allowed to not follow the LLm delivery guidelines.  Sry",btohqsg
I even saw an uncle bring weighing machine with him weigh items before in warehouse.  Lol.  Why not man,btohqsg
Thank you! Will try if encounter the next time!,btohqsg
Precisely   abusive customers made the choice to try their luck in lalamove.  Many are banned by abusing ggv. So they keep use LLm.  Peninsula that Viet lady told me ggv banned her. Cos I bird her say her 2cartons so huge why order car   ask her if she go try ggv she need pay more inclusive $15 labour fee.  Then she said kena banned. Lol,btohqsg
Don't so formal leh.  We all victims,btohqsg
Tdy no way go into suntec,btohqsg
Sometimes  job never indicate size of items and when you reach then you know its a few big cartons of heavy weight. How?,btohqsg
You need to call the customer and ask what item  no of item to deliver. The best to send you a photo if he doesn't know how to describe,btohqsg
Call the person before go down to collect.  Don't go believe their bullshits that not heavy or nt huge.  Ask them send pic in the app.  Ask them Wad are the items to be delivered,btohqsg
hi guys  has anyone here taken order from kranji camp before? how long did it take for yall to receive the money?,btohqsg
They should pass you immediately after you pass the item if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
this one heng seweh same like use we swap take order.always see who heng seweh get first if that incase ifcase no choice take or dont take risk once u at there ready u see uself if dislike ask them to cancel job tell them honestly u cannot take the job because u dont like and pls dont take gas money from them u u time waste to come there also.all the best,btohqsg
this is right advisable to call them afraid they scam or book wrongly and if really some cs did sent some photo ready but this funny  photo looks easy come out u go there haha it is not easy same like some girl‚Äôs photo look very pretty real life looks same auntie ,btohqsg
If food order to bungalow than no one pick up how uh,btohqsg
they might listen to u and change to bigger vechicle but the problem is after that end paying u the amount they come and complain u and we driver had to answer and worst still u have to refund then back.,btohqsg
put outside after also they come complain u the food is cold r bird have been attack driver fail to find them and finally worst u have to pay all the amount of the food and u deliveries fees also might be taken.,btohqsg
But Best is Inform Customer and LiveChat in case people Took it they say NEVER Saw.,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone encountered this before? Cash out failed. üòí,btohqsg
Lol....all u need is evidence.  Inform Cs abt they upgrade to mpv order etc. But if u drives a car  best is make sure u know u are nt treated like a Bangladesh worker before going down. Don't assume the customers can do anything they want.  Cannot have such negative mentality. Screenshot down,btohqsg
Motherswork lor . Those stuffs.  Quite bulky one,btohqsg
Cannot la.  LLm not same grab.  Must have ppl receive,btohqsg

Oddle platform I found out If timing states 330pm.  The restaurant will have their timing as 340pm.  This oddle trying Makan our 10mins parking time,btohqsg

This type crazy one don't need answer their phone calls when already on the way to drop off.  If not just tell them cannot talk while driving later accident food also gone,btohqsg
Welcome to the kena abuse club,btohqsg
Those obviously earn more but maybe more tiring.  Most delivery drivers try everything for fun laughter peace and joy.  Most impt is drive safe and don't get scammed,btohqsg
You mean those people don‚Äôt pay after delivery? üòÖ,btohqsg

Is it true that we have to the sticker on before the van can be registered?,btohqsg
I think you need to register first then once approve  they ask you to schedule to paste the sticker.,btohqsg
You Paste their Sticker to help them FREE Advertise. But Fares still no good,btohqsg
Yea compare now the price is no good. But if you want to take the order nobody stopping you.,btohqsg
which option should i choose if i need to transport a table from a sellers place to my house ?,btohqsg

Hi all  the Lalamove profile there got Fans. What is the Fans about?,btohqsg

Food order not ready bcos system booked earlier than the restaurant order time according to the restaurant person in charge. 11.50  actual time is 12.30 restaurant said you not happy go talk with lalamove,btohqsg
Because self employed is only entitled to residents who hold valid residency status. They don't have someone to report to daily. Late or no show or whatever also no issue.Work permit holders or foreigners must first pass medical test. Which self employed platform workers don't require. Boss or employer must pay monthly work permit fee or lodging fee for foreigners. Entitled to sick leave and AL. bonuses and 13 month. Must report on stipulated time and days,btohqsg
Foreigners working as deliveryman or delivery rider is perfectly ok. Just not on self employed status,btohqsg
None of us riders or drivers are legally employed by any platform. So we are considered self employed platform workers,btohqsg
The other order last minute ask me to wait for 10-15 minutes while the worker was preparing foods  many people walk in for lunch. I ask the staff how long to wait she said still got 8-10 packages  died liao,btohqsg
bro claim wating time from llm,btohqsg
Hence foreign deliveryman/rider in lalamove/grab/Foodpanda/gogo is not allowed and illegal,btohqsg
Correction:Foreigner are not allowed to work in any work gains be it delivery or anything else on self employed statusForeigner are allowed to work delivery but must be on valid employment status. Not on self employed status.,btohqsg
They can work lalamove. No issue. Write in to lalamove and apply to be an employee driver not partnership contractors,btohqsg
"Which no platform willing to hire because they don't want liabilites eg  COE  new bike  repairs  worker levy fee etc.Once they buy new vehicles and someone resign  the vehicle stays idle until new arrival comes and they don't want this to happen. They prefer partners and contractors who ""bao ka liao"" without a single liability",btohqsg
They don't have such arrangement nw so no point. It confuses reader if they are foreigners who are unable to work & doing so illegally,btohqsg
Err. I think DHL does employ foreign delivery logistics workers. Correct me if i am wrong. But they are on employment rules and a basic pay package,btohqsg
There are also small SMC logistics companies who provide foreign workers as riders for delivery companies like Grab also.,btohqsg
Lalamove they don't have such arrangements. The question is when they have an order that no one wants to accept  they try engage other platforms or maybe these small SMC companies. These companies will deploy their foreigners to pickup the order.,btohqsg
companies like DHL or small MNC companies employs their own worker for their own deliveries  that's ok. E.g. designated driver for one particular company and only do delivery for that one company. Gig jobs such as lalamove/grab/food panda are not allowed for foreigners as they do not have such arrangements.  This is to protect the locals livelihood,btohqsg
Normal company arrangements/rules different from gig jobs platform,btohqsg
"Problem is gig economy companies play the game of ""sublet the job"" to other small companies who hire foreigners. GoGo is one example",btohqsg
The moment u sublet a job to these company  u will see foreigner go pickup,btohqsg
First 10mins foc for customers lor. Subsequent 10mins then charges $2 extra. Malls parking only 10mins grace  means confirm kena parking charges. üòë,btohqsg
For van order no waiting fee bcos we r giving 30mins to load items include this shit arrangements,btohqsg
That's why I got 2 orders at the same time,btohqsg
I don't think so   if either recipient or sender let me wait more than 10mins I am able to claim waiting fee,btohqsg
I asked for waiting time last time CS told me that and refused to give me waiting time fee  may be that CS don't know and I got scammed,btohqsg
When reached give a call to cus/rec   after that make sure to SS the call log send csüëç,btohqsg
Would these items and 8 other cartons fit in a 1.7m van? Just cancelled this order,btohqsg
