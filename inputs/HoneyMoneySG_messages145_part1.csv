I went through some of his recent cpf videos cuz its time to top up. Didnt recall he said something like that.For tax reduction purposes  after max your own contribution  top up ur love one‚Äôs cpf or srs.,btohqsg
Never once mentioned that you can RSTU after hitting FRS on SA.,btohqsg
Maybe it about after Medisave deduction then you top up or 1 Jan top up for Medisave.,btohqsg
This happeens to MA  not SA,btohqsg
I think so liao. Mixed up. Thanks.,btohqsg
Will address new BHS and related actions in today's video on CPF,btohqsg
My medisave also maxed out. So troublesome after maxing out.,btohqsg
MA u have two windows to top up1. When BHS is adjusted every year.2.When there is outflow from yr MA like premium for medishield life  care shield life etc...do a check on yr 2024 transaction history u will see when those are deducted and top up in between this and the next monthly CPF contribution from yr employment.,btohqsg
For SA  once reached FRS  thats it. U can top up for loved ones if eligible,btohqsg
For my case for 2025  4k to match new BHS. 1.5k throughout the year for various premium deduction,btohqsg
No love one to top up but I might do screening or CSL supplement but not confirm yet,btohqsg

After the CPF Medisave top up of $400/500 in Dec. The current balance of MA for those who hit BHS already should $72K.Does it mean we can only top up $3.5K? Or will the whole amount go back to $71.5K after the interest is credit and transfer to OA/SA?,btohqsg
I decided to use scb esaver for the few days of parking.,btohqsg
If your MA already hit BHS by Dec  interest earned will go to SA or OA if SA has hit FRS.,btohqsg
can check if this offer is the same as the TnC in the Singsaver Christmas event? Seems like only need to spend $500 within 30 days of card approval  in comparison to the one stated here,btohqsg
Don't see a difference.. Chris' link lead to Singsavers' website which says $500 as well.https://hmsg.link/singsaverhsbc,btohqsg
I see  was looking at the eligibility part via the telegram message stating need to spend $600 for 3 months to qualify,btohqsg
