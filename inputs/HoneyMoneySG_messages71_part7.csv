Is it automatically earmarked? How do we do it in the stash account?,btohqsg
Oh üò• Which card is best suited to get more cash back or miles for furniture?,btohqsg
U can search for card that gave 4 mpd for paywave like uob prefer plat  uob visa signature and get merchant to spilt the bill according to reward cap,btohqsg
Time to switch to iPhone and at the same time can prevent hackers :),btohqsg
Thanks! What‚Äôs the difference between pref plat and visa signature? Visa signature seems to include overseas spending too.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone using CIMB World mastercard and CIMB visa signature card? Are there any benefits in using either of them?,btohqsg
If we pay for vendors like zip track and decking etc? I think that they are also not considered as any particular mcc code?,btohqsg
As long as mcc not excluded  using mobile paywave will get 4 miles per dollar up to the card cap which u can read up on,btohqsg
Any cash back card is better than Citibank‚Äôs ?,btohqsg
Hsbc advance up to 2.8k spending,btohqsg
Minimum 2k spending to get 2.5 percent cashback. And also other csshback like live fresh  frank  evol  prefer plat,btohqsg

Hi all  may I ask a silly question how do I know the balances I have deposited last month for the UOB National Day Promo is being earmarked? Thank you.,btohqsg

Hi all experts  newbie here..Recently applied for the Uob EVOL  and tried to clock the min $600  besides the online and mobile payment total $500  usually where you guys charge the another $100? Checked the T&C  it looked like a lot of exclusions.I tried searching through the group but did not find any info answer my question. Thanks in advanced üôè,btohqsg
Oh no my available balance is still the same as the current balance  it seemed that UOB did not reduce it by the same amount I have submitted for the National Day promotion. I‚Äôll call the CSO to check. Thank you Sir for your advice! üôèüèª,btohqsg
When did you put the money in,btohqsg

Hi all  been using amaze + citi rewards for payments to my clinic visits  and been getting 4mpd of those transactions.But understand now amaze charges for payments to healthcare institutions....so what would the next best card be for Miles rewards?? Thank you so much!!,btohqsg
Anyone knows about ichange? If yes? Is it better than YouTrip?,btohqsg
Does citi rewards via Google pay qualify as online transaction?,btohqsg
Thanks  which means it won't qualify for 4mpd yea?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc need to be online,btohqsg
if more than $1k local spend in a month can paywave using uob visa signature,btohqsg
how does scb esaver work   maybank isavvy work,btohqsg
the remaining $100 just spend as per normal on non-excluded and hit $600. That's what is meant by you earn 8% on $500  but actually effective is 6.67% on $600 spend.,btohqsg
Thank you again. Can I kindly clarify to get 4mpd via DBS WWMC  only online transactions valid? And since amaze cannot pair with it already  kinda means it's not a top choice for day to day use?,btohqsg
Maybe not a top choice for u. Plus dbs wwmc point expire one year from now,btohqsg
Thank you so much. So after I've maxed out $1k on amaze + citi rewards  what's the next best day to day combo?,btohqsg
Erm really depend on your spending habit. Just asking in general wont give u helpful answer,btohqsg
Hi all  does it make sense to use instalment payments for higher value items e.g Apple products to hit minimum monthly spend for credit cards?,btohqsg
Installment dont count towards monthly spend,btohqsg
Unless u use app like atome,btohqsg
I personally will be willing to tank that 1% charge since no other cards from what I know can beat the (4mpd - 1%cash) reward as of now,btohqsg
Hi All  What is the best miles card to purchase apple products?,btohqsg
Noted. But barring any specific MCC  what are your suggestions after maxing the citi rewards  for miles? Just curious what the experts do üòäüòä,btohqsg
