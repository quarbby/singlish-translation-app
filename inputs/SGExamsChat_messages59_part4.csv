But you stay inside longer means more debt,btohqsg
Ah so that's what you mean by extend,btohqsg
What's the benefit of extending though  isn't the merits of going out and (hopefully) finding a job albeit lower paying better than waiting 6/12 more months,btohqsg
First job pay is generically used as a predictor for final salary in life,btohqsg
Also I’m not ready for a job,btohqsg
Thats not true for accounting though,btohqsg
Ok i'm not so sure about how starting salary affects your subsequent salaries,btohqsg
Then again  while probably statistically true I don't see how 'graduating later' into a better economy helps with pay later in life?,btohqsg
First job affects everything including promotion opportunities,btohqsg
On your CV you are judged by first position,btohqsg
Are you speaking as someone that's alr in the workforce or?,btohqsg
You are also quickly judged if you are 'High Potential',btohqsg
I speaking to random strangers on a public forum,btohqsg
You can take it or leave it - you are also free to think you are so outside the mold that none of this will affect you,btohqsg
Cuz TBH  I think of what I am saying as 'true' in the statistical sense,btohqsg
So long as >50.01% of population have final pay predicted by 1st pay  it's 'ok-enough' to claim that 1st pay predicts final pay,btohqsg
Fresh grad tech 4.4k considered low tho,btohqsg
Yolo i'll worry about it when i reach that point,btohqsg
IDK sia  I can actually ask,btohqsg
TIL NTU Confessions has a Telegram Channel,btohqsg
My source says 3.5k  so 4k+ must be interesting,btohqsg
to be fair also got form class,btohqsg
thats what my math tr said,btohqsg
but he taught for 3 yrs,btohqsg
Any govt sector also got diff fch what,btohqsg
Problem with FCH Cher is that  if you stay on teaching track you will end at 8k,btohqsg
seems like being a Cher is a good career,btohqsg
If it’s about money  tutoring is even better,btohqsg
Yes but are you REALLY willing to tell people (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 is wrong for 3857987395795337598759835794835893 ... times?,btohqsg
Unless u are those star tutors,btohqsg
sorry  3857987395795337598759835794835893 is an understatement  I need Knuth arrows to show how many times students can make the exact same misakes,btohqsg
Sign on also guaranteed to get uni paid for tho,btohqsg
the only prerequisite is 90 rp right,btohqsg
I don’t think you need 90 for MOE scholarship,btohqsg
And also you need to go through MOE Teaching internship,btohqsg
if we can't enter sg uni with 60 rp,btohqsg
why don't they make A lvl grading like O lvl,btohqsg
I didnt even make the cut for MOE JCTIP with my prelims,btohqsg
That’s cause you had A Levels,btohqsg
That can be considered average horh,btohqsg
And you didn’t have uni the year you got your A Levels,btohqsg
You're still going for MOE cher rite,btohqsg
Can I ask why you wanna be cher,btohqsg
Same qn  why you want to be cher?,btohqsg
Most ppl go in there eventually for the money,btohqsg
And I want to help them become good peoples,btohqsg
Is just like how ppl sign on in mindef,btohqsg
But ofc need have the passion,btohqsg
I believe most ppl have the passion,btohqsg
But ultimately is a stable career,btohqsg
