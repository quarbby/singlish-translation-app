Hmm don’t see any promo code but thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Makes sense. They force all card top-ups to levy fee  most people opt to just top-up via PayNow.,btohqsg
Mytrip have a high amount of bad reviews  especially comes to refunds. No office in SG also. 👀,btohqsg
Hi Chris. Able to elaborate more on step 4:how to issue $8 premiums?I thought I knew but I keep facing issues trying to link my amaze or Uob lady card (keep saying invalid card number),btohqsg
Not by me but another contributor:Investment > Single top-up > Click build your coverage and a % portion of it will fulfill the premiums,btohqsg
Have to link visa card somehow  i try a few mastercard cant link,btohqsg
Thanks queenie. I was guessing as such but seems all my easily used cards are master. Hahaha.Will link Uob one card then,btohqsg
What i did was use the nominated card for snack to top up ezlink wallet since ezlink wallet have spending campaign now (up to 10 percent cashback). Need to open your lifestyle activites top up premium option and increase your weekly cap.,btohqsg
I might just topup Starbucks card since it’s 5814 under food category. Nominate HSBC live+ visa,btohqsg
U need to top up alot of time  per transaction max 70 cent top up to premium  so i find ezlink the easiest for now for me haha. 8 dollar u need to do at least 12 time,btohqsg
Wah so this first step is really quite pain in the S,btohqsg
Can set for critical   accident and lifeThen is $2.1 per transaction,btohqsg
Can also but still need 4 times  i only qualify for accident that why,btohqsg
Ezlink i can do at my own time own target. Go store do mutiple time get the stare from staff haha,btohqsg
There will be time when snack decide to play punk and the spending dont count,btohqsg
The mcc of the visa spend must match the activity set right. That’s damn irritating,btohqsg
Can’t they just let us pay $8 premium directly. So stupid,btohqsg
Let’s nerf everything left for Snack. Maybank was just a first step 😂,btohqsg
Nothing much is left to be honest to get from snack premium using cc,btohqsg
Ezlink Spend exclude mcc 4111 and 6300  correct?,btohqsg
I am talking about using link card in snack to top up ezlink wallet to move the premium counter. Not talking about using ezlink wallet card to spend for snack.,btohqsg
Although i already have plan on what can be spend for the 600 ezlink campaign (up to 10 percent cashback),btohqsg
Hi  any suggestion best way (cheapest and best exchange rate) to transfer USD to local USD bank account (I think it's HSBC)?  Thanks.,btohqsg
What’s the difference between Life and Investment category? If I only turn on Investment  will the $8 go into Asia income fund? Instead of wasted in life insurance?,btohqsg
U have to do insurance  i tried investment and it din work,btohqsg
What’s most hilarious is if after so many years when Amaze is finally compatible with Apple Pay  then Citi nerf CRMC + Amaze 😂,btohqsg
But i think need to do due diligence. If i remember correctly the fund it buys includes China,btohqsg
The Best Cash Savings Strategy for 3Q 2024 is brokenhttps://youtu.be/5az40Y0qWKs,btohqsg
hmm I guess this is a quick way to fulfil the Step One requirement without having to incur additional spending,btohqsg
