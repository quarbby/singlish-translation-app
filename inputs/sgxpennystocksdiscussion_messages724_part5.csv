Yup👍..

Pollux Prop($0.039) about time.- Broke out of downtrend line- Most weak hands flushed in the meltdown- 38 Sellers dried up can tell from recent PA- MACD golden cross should be Monday.- should test $0.044/$0.045 this week as they dropped fast and thus will recover fast now that boat is lighter.Watch closely next week from the get go.,btohqsg
As such  I feel this round the recovery is going to be longer than what we expected..may look at HSI🇭🇰 jialat nearly two years liao but..the whole drop not end yet..before we talk about the recovery period,btohqsg
Recovery in high interest environment always difficult. Previous recessions mostly on low interest and low inflation environment. Monetary lossening help the recovery,btohqsg

Scrolling through old baby pictures and saw this. Back in April 2020  IX BioPharma with some serious liquidity and medical was in full fledge play.Amazing once game goes to rest  counter can go to some serious sleep 💤.Hence  the importance of STOP Loss and emphasis on it always.Anyways  IX currently just illiquid  With their award news and if they want game  expect easily 20 - 50 pips type of run from Current illiquid price $0.127,btohqsg
Clearbridge should build a flag for a bit before another round pump up.It’s just simply too cheap at current price.I see many retailers chasing and joining this one late when 6-7 series.Therefore  I believe a lot more legs to run.,btohqsg
Background on Clearbridge (Aug22)Covering this one now because recently volume came in  timely as reversal in the making.I like to anticipate go in early. Chasing is not fortehttps://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/V6NC88A0NYLTQ8YX/729157_Clearbridge_Corporate%20Presentation_August%202022.pdf,btohqsg
Back on 7th Oct 2022  Clearbridge ($0.049) announced this disposal of 2 of their entities at total consideration of $11 mil which gives them a gain of $1.98mil on this disposal.Price did not moved as market was super bad that day.But now that sentiments shifted  this old news will take effect and aid the reversal.I don’t see how Clearbridge can fake and stuck at this price range.They will be forced to make a bigger move up  Without doubt.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/A0TK5PH0AQC1H0LV/733786_Announcement%20-%20CBMA%20and%20SAM%20Disposal%20Final.pdf,btohqsg
