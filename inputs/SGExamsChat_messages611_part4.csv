might have to change to clb rip,btohqsg
idk if she even rmb me,btohqsg
uk nobody asked but if I have any advice for any clb students  I would say don't be put down/influenced by other clb students who genuinely dl/hate chi  cause idk abt u but for me  i find that when I dislike/hate a subj  its always because i do badly in it and I keep lamenting/dreading abt it. Now when that happens  I find that such thoughts really cloud my judgement and I ended up not being appreciative of such a wonderful language which is in fact my mother tongue. I ended up not knowing what I could've learn/know more  I hope my sharing gives you/whoever more insight,btohqsg
No she look 30 year old,btohqsg
