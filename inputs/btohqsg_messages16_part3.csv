seeing the sink is at the blue mark. means directly below is the drain pipe. IF really can do  must make sure waterproofing must be done properly else. downstairs neighbour will request you redo the waterproofing.,btohqsg
No  they said you hack urs self,btohqsg
Hi is there any group for the upcoming BtO Ghim moh Natura or ulu Pandan banks? Thank uüòÄ,btohqsg
Highly cannot since the blue area is structural wall,btohqsg
i thought thick line means structural wall? blue area here is thin line,btohqsg
I'm thinking about applying for bto in Tengah but scared it's too ulu,btohqsg
Which location do you think is not ulu?,btohqsg
i mean it's very near to forest,btohqsg
That whole area gonna become BTO though so by the time you move in might not have that much forest already,btohqsg
im thinking of selling my 5 room resale flat and get a 4 room bto,btohqsg
If you got time  go down to HDB to see the Tengah planning model.,btohqsg
haha im a east sider here so it's pretty new to me,btohqsg
im hoping to see more BTOs in east side,btohqsg
its a bit far from gombak MRT  but i think cycle-able haha,btohqsg
oh damn  i don't know how to cycle hahahha,btohqsg
my old place is in Serangoon btw,btohqsg
i think i prefer Pasir Ris or Tampines,btohqsg
i think i will just wait for May because i saw Bedok inside,btohqsg
Hi  ID here. The line is a non-structural wall. Structural walls consist of HS & Columns (250mm thick). Non-structural walls are 100mm (like the one in blue). Hope this helps.,btohqsg
New BTO @ highest floor is it +30cm height than others? Some said Yes but HDB officers said No  who is correct?,btohqsg

Hi all happy Sunday! just checking if anyone got their notifications yet for key collection for Rivervale shores?,btohqsg
Hi all just want to check one thingIf me n my gf apply under co owner ( to use cpf for for downpayment )can we change it later down the road to owner-occupier ( assuming that my income is sufficient to cover to loan ),btohqsg
Which stage of the BTO are you at now?,btohqsg
Currently planning to do this for the upcoming launch   Havent balloted yet,btohqsg
If you haven't balloted then you have the choice whether you want to do co-applicant or main applicant and essential occupier now.I think the latest to change is during flat selection. Do clarify with HDB as well via email.,btohqsg
Yes  only can do when you submit the bto applicationIf after flat selection  probably still can appeal.After down payment  there is no way to change unless you have super good reason.,btohqsg
