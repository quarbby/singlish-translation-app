It's just without defections plus a whip just means there is literally no choice,btohqsg
But also I don’t know why some of Mr Leong Horn kee’s pap colleagues disagreed with him when he said that the whip prevented them from speaking up  that dude was speaking facts,btohqsg
Even for the MPs whom are supposed to be the literal lawmakers,btohqsg
Yeah good for stability but it makes them vote against their conscience at times,btohqsg
lol kj is still railing against the wp since he thinks wp sidelined jbj,btohqsg
Kj is no jbj for sure,btohqsg
I mean lifting the defections Clause would still ensure a functional democracy and would be inline with the Westminster system,btohqsg
The defections clause should still exist for votes of confidence and supply imo,btohqsg
The moment they vote against I do think it’s reasonable for them to be expelled,btohqsg
They should also not be allowed to switch or resign from the party,btohqsg
Defections are a different procedural method than Confidence and supply agreements,btohqsg
Allowing defections just lifts the caps and places more independent MPs,btohqsg
They can still caucus with PAP,btohqsg
I mean if an MP was elected on a party ticket  they ought to at least take the same position as the party for votes relating to confidence and supply to ensure stability,btohqsg
It’s not reasonable to allow them to cross the floor on such occasions,btohqsg
Which again.. is so because of the GRC system,btohqsg
If it's an SMC the MP was elected on their individual merits,btohqsg
those small parties are pretty ass,btohqsg
Nah I legit don’t think that should be allowed. If they can resign and join another party/become independent they may not support the party’s position that they were elected on. Like imagine if pap formed government with a one vote majority  but their MP defects to the opposition and brings down the government. Not a good idea. If he really disagrees with them he should not be allowed to switch without a by election where the MP can get a fresh mandate from the voters,btohqsg
True  with the grc system I guess it fosters more camaraderie since they’re like forced to stick together. It kind of brings them closer to the party  since they also won’t want to betray their friends that they campaigned with,btohqsg
Erm bringing down the government.Have u ever heard of a minority government,btohqsg
Even with just a 1 vote majority and defection it would still be fine assuming u get a compromise with member of other parties then,btohqsg
In fact it's better to force Bipartisan solutions sometimes,btohqsg
I’m saying if they change sides and back a no confidence motion by the opposition when they were previously a ruling party MP  I don’t think it should be allowed,btohqsg
Allows for idiotic plans to be cut down,btohqsg
minoritiy governments would require confidence and supply which really is er..,btohqsg
They can still choose to bring down the government if the other opposition parties refuse to do any confidence and supply deals,btohqsg
i mean look at scotland rn  for the SNP  they might have to govern with alba after a new FM is chosen,btohqsg
Even if they did push a motion of no confidence unless the entire opposition votes Aye it will not pass,btohqsg
And also even if the vote of no confidence goes through without an alternative arrangement the now minority government will continue over as caretaker,btohqsg
So it will still be fine,btohqsg
Belgium had a caretaker government for like years lmao,btohqsg
Well that’s assuming if they don’t do that. It’s possible the other side completely refuses to work with the ruling party and are hell bent on bringing down the government,btohqsg
Won’t it force a snap election?,btohqsg
Actually can send me the link lol I want to take a look,btohqsg
U don't have to do so it can be totally up to the executive branch,btohqsg
If the government is not able to function at all tbh and has to keep on negotiating or held hostage by other opposition parties to get sufficient votes what’s the point tbh  if at the previous election the voters delivered then the mandate to govern in majority but because of some MPs who defect midway through the parliamentary term that’s not happening,btohqsg
Also motions of no confidence aren't totally bad u can have motions which purposefully test the government's support on certain issues,btohqsg
everytime i open this chat  always got random wall of texts,btohqsg
Depends on what u mean by function confidence and supply agreements could still be drawn up or if there's a deadlock or hung parliament the previous budget could be used as the current budget to tide things over,btohqsg
Or the threshold for supply motions could be lowered to ensure funding,btohqsg
wait whats the diff btwn conf+supply and coalition?,btohqsg
Depends on country but broadly conf+supply is more lax,btohqsg
PH  BN and PN are equally shit,btohqsg
even as a harapan supporter  god damn bro  malaysia regardless of whos PM will drive malaysia into the ground,btohqsg
That one is systemic issues that u can't just pin on electoral system liao,btohqsg
I always thought in the case of no confidence motions  regardless of what the issue is about  if the government fails it they’d had to call snap elections. Even if that’s not the case in some countries  I’m pretty sure it is for most.But anyway  I think that as long as MPs are elected on the ticket of a party  they ought to be forced to at least support them on issues concerning whether the government can function. Even if there’s no snap elections and all that  the caretaker government would be forced into doing deals with opposition parties when they were supposed to have the mandate to govern in majority the last election. They should not be forced to bend to the opposition’s demands unless that’s what voters want by delivering a hung parliament imo,btohqsg
Not necessarily and sometimes the threat of a no confidence motion is enough.,btohqsg
The British PM resigning was because she knew she was fucked and that allowed for the party itself to reshuffle and place a new PM,btohqsg
and like bersatu and the party-hopping shit,btohqsg
