Btw  any lao jiao got advice for me?Last nite i picked up a suspicious job.Order from teban to taman jurong.Sender met me at lift lobby  passed a sealed small brown paper bag.I sent to a kfc delivery guy at taman jurong.,btohqsg
I did a detour and stacked another job on the way Sender WA me sounding concern item not sent.,btohqsg
I found it suspicious becos it was a dude sending something to a dude nearby.And the receiver obv rides a bike.,btohqsg
I think you can think of a lot of reasons,btohqsg
Office hours their CS and live chat already ba long long .....after hrs where got llm contact?,btohqsg
I didnt suspect anything until i hand over the bag to the kfc guy,btohqsg
Night orders esp after midnight  you can be quite sure 50% is send drugs,btohqsg
at night lots of drug trafficking. usually they never input unit number. can be ahlong job or drug trafficking. i encounter many times. drug at least got delivery fees. ahlong totally block u. just need u to knock door to collect money.(but sure knock door they wont open),btohqsg
Some ppl think their address or postal code is some gospel truth  they dunno that even postal code doesnt guarantee an accurate pin on gps,btohqsg
ever encounter  10 bottle cough syrup in transparent bag. also ever encounter drug instrument. but sometime put at fire riser. but at least they paynow  rather than ahlong totally no fees collected,btohqsg
Are we implicated if we courier illegal substance?I mean my bag was sealed  it is not like we know the contents,btohqsg
drug case confirm they still pay u. if ahlong  u cry. knock house end up kana cheat,btohqsg
We are not expected to check or open sealed package  so in that sense i believe not implicatedAt most  u jus ask what it is  what they want to tell u is their taiji,btohqsg
I kenna lots of road block when i drive at nite.....i got the decent middle class face....they always wave me to go one.,btohqsg

The current system really don‚Äôt allow you to camp one place swipe job,btohqsg

"Customers can mark you as a favouriteWhen they make an order  u get to see it before anyone else no matter where u areThe job appears with a heart icon and default ringtone is some goondu guy singing the line ""you are my hero""",btohqsg
Can we see which customer marked us?,btohqsg
You will know when they make a booking,btohqsg
But well  it seems no use being a hero nowStickers still have more XP üôÑ,btohqsg

I dont do grabfood anymore. I thought i want to rent a van n do lalamove as part time after my fulltime job,btohqsg

*March*Earning: $2 647.80Petrol: $680Rental: $1120Miscellaneous: $60Nett Income: $787.80Worked 16 days.,btohqsg
FYI for whoever is planning to rent a car to do lala  very bohua,btohqsg
Need to see the 16 days how much hrs you do bah.,btohqsg
Sure bike better due to lower cost.,btohqsg
Ya Lah I rent car partly also for family usage,btohqsg
Car need to stack abit n really efficient,btohqsg
Just sharing since time to time I see got new people here asking,btohqsg
Same to fetch kids n stuff included,btohqsg
ya lo.. but I think it is still quite a big waste of time,btohqsg
Efficiency important dun do for sake of do,btohqsg
First mth i took all orders including bikes orders really not gd,btohqsg
If you replace rental with car ownership cost?,btohqsg
2nd mth focus on car job n stack,btohqsg
Can see its ok can cover,btohqsg
Insurance n road tax n coe?,btohqsg
I don't take bike at all,btohqsg
Dunno I'm asking. I ride bike.,btohqsg
all inclusive should be around 1700 right,btohqsg
In my opinion i will do lalamove n also grabhitch or something,btohqsg
Wahhh if its main income reallyyy hard sia,btohqsg
really must be damn pro lo,btohqsg
If take out rental?$1120+787 is quite decent for 2 weeks?,btohqsg
787 is Nett Income after expenses,btohqsg
787 for 2 weeksso 4 weeks $1.6k Nett Income?,btohqsg
Own or rent still got expenses  cannot take out completely.,btohqsg
Worked abt 20 days mostly from 1030am onwards to mostly 4pm take last order sometimes will do till 6 only 1 day i did till 9pm,btohqsg
really is cover car expense only lo,btohqsg
Mainly focus on lunch car order,btohqsg
Then if go ulu place no orders left  do hitch,btohqsg
Did you track costs? I think you din earn much with car costs.,btohqsg
Own car do lalamove also bo hua.,btohqsg
Better to have the lalamove sticker on the car .,btohqsg
Can get more car jobs .,btohqsg
Since llm reduce the rateCan stop liao,btohqsg
Because too little car order. Mostly it bike order but need to take.,btohqsg
That why I also only do high return mission,btohqsg
$36 for 12 order from Thur to sun I also skip.,btohqsg
Ok lah. Supply and demand. When many ppl throw key  order price will increase. Then ppl will go in do,btohqsg
Do full time not adviceable.  Part time ok la but do bike job . Better have a bike . 3 hours can make abt 30 plus if good 40 over .,btohqsg
My friend in downtown doing panda etc  hit $100 in 4hrs,btohqsg
I have been doing since 2016 .,btohqsg
But downtown for car and motorcycle it hard due to traffic.,btohqsg
So actually he told me ebike and bicycle will earn more,btohqsg
Registered bicycle but using bike say can earn better . Geylang area .,btohqsg
Too far out for me. I stay jurong,btohqsg
But I have full time job so I just leave do 2 to 3 order everyday .,btohqsg
Ok short time fast i think no issue .,btohqsg
Wah. 2 to 3 order will take up at least 1h ++...,btohqsg
This not good strategy coz the unpaid traveling time is very high for short burst work.,btohqsg
As in travelling to first drop then going home time.,btohqsg
Better rate with panda or grab  short nearby trips. Vs islandwide.,btohqsg
See how u choose ur order   need fast finger n quick planning,btohqsg
I don't chase for it mine only $2 tips  üòÜ,btohqsg
40 per day if count 31 days,btohqsg
I arrived at pick up point only to find out my order is cancelled. It was a 12am job  how do i resolve this?,btohqsg
Customer is the 1 hr alcohol delivery shop at Sims Ave.They don't pick up calls and I have dome many jobs for them already.So i usually swipe and go for them.,btohqsg
The lucky thing for me is I picked up another job next door that got me closer to home and paid more too.,btohqsg
Ya I kanna cancelled by them too. Reach they tell me cancelled . Can‚Äôt do anything . If they don‚Äôt pick up calls just don‚Äôt proceed  if you proceed it‚Äôs risky cause if cancel you won‚Äôt get anything. I don‚Äôt really like doing jobs for them because got one dude there abit stuck up.,btohqsg
Tbh ... cancellation charges are quite hard to claim if it‚Äôs a cash job. Easier to claim if it‚Äôs a credit . Then again  always contact cs if customer don‚Äôt pick up and if after office hours of lala help Center  don‚Äôt proceed unless 1)it‚Äôs a credit job. 2)customer pick up and ask you to proceed. Because if customer cancel when you arrive at least you can get cancellation fees. If it‚Äôs cash job 90% customer won‚Äôt pay the fee. They‚Äôll act blur .,btohqsg
I got a feeling today will be quiet unless oodle jobs lol,btohqsg

Stacking must1. Call n confirm and ask if can collect earlier2. Make sure both are either SAME/very very close pickup OR drop off,btohqsg

I would say do sails firstThe ones who stay sails have mindset that they are super near to restaurant  after 30min or 40min max  you are alrdy late. Bedok is further and u have more allowance for excuses like jam... accident....etc etc if u run lateIf you do bedok 1st  u will be late for bothDo sails first  got chance at most only bedok black face,btohqsg
Heavy rain üåß all sleep no rider üò¥,btohqsg

Did they change the T&C?This means what? If u accept adv orders during mission timing no count?,btohqsg
adv orders count only if taken (matched) and completed within mission timing.,btohqsg
They basically want u to chiong 1 stop jobs non stop during those hrs,btohqsg
not too bad  its 4 hour slots. next day jobs dont count though.,btohqsg
They didnt have this condition for newbie mission,btohqsg
yep the newbie missions are easier.,btohqsg
Always remember1) if overweight  you are always entitled to an upgrade.2)waiting time also can claim but you must inform support when you reach.,btohqsg

This clown gave me this address,btohqsg
I reach Ave 2 is condo postal code....i call him to verify,btohqsg

I told u eh hello ave 2 and 3 is 10 mins apart,btohqsg
He change topic tell me customer is waiting and food is cold liaoz,btohqsg
6 stops and this was last stop,btohqsg
Can but u must be driving a car when u accept motor. If you drive motor cannot upgrade to car,btohqsg
Knn i call him not to ask him for more $ but to cfm,btohqsg
If wrong address contact CS they will add the fee for additional stop,btohqsg
Cash job and i CBF with CS seriously,btohqsg
I suggest next time don't take motor multi stop. Not worth it. Deduct fuel price... Left with cents,btohqsg
If car mutli stop still ok,btohqsg
I used to do groceries drops,btohqsg
