💎Pika World Update- 15 March 2022💎🚘Equity Markets on a Rough Ride💸As the supply chains in China are back in the highlight of the week  the Covid-18 lockdown in China is yet to hit many companies as it faced the worst outbreak in 2 years.Cases have been jumping hihg since Sunday as many manufacturing plants were shut off for non-essential operations. Among those  medical  food and fuel deliveries were still functionally and many citizens in affected cities had to do PCR tests over the next few days.It is likely to cast a shadow over global economic growth as the giant economy hit with a cooling blanket on more stringent lockdown measures in key cities of manufacturing.🎈A Bleak Outlook?🔫Whenever a joyous news ride on  there is bound to be a negative. The Ukraine-Russia war is an example of the oil-price shock hurting the risk-on sentiment. It is likely to pull down US spending and weaken economic growth.Analysts were quick to discount some growth given the background of geopolitical risk. For example  Goldman Sachs cut its economic forecasts and highlighted the risk of supply chain issues. As a result  there appeared to be a higher factoring of a possibility of a recession  although the risk is still low.🎁Risks posed by Geopolitical Tension🔨It is a multidimensional risk that is affecting the world market. First  there is a sharp rise in commodity prices and poorer consumer sentiments. Internal export tends to moderate in uncertain times. The fall in disposable income is likely to hit hard on the households as gas and food prices jump. The pandemic savings are draining out as lower-income families had to spend a large portion of their income on food and gas. Therefore  there is a likelihood of reducing spending on clothes and furniture.As consumer sentiments soured  so will be the consumer spending. The University of Michigan showed clearly that the consumer sentiment index had fallen by about 30% for the past year as consumers took a cautious stance on the ongoing war.Given the uncertainty still roaming around the market  Pika World maintains a cautious stance and look for opportunity in alternative assets to hopefully cushion the blow in our portfolio.It is on March Tuesday  7.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe and healthy week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Afternoon Update- 16 March 2022✈️🧯PPI data show hope🎁The latest PPI data shows weaker input cost for producer and investors are hoping for weaker inflation ahead. Core PPI took out energy and food prices which are volatile  and it is moderating. Market participants appear to see that it could signal that inflation is perhaps peaking and an inflection point is arriving.This is sufficient to send major indices to jump higher. Pika World will be looking at CPI data for further confirmation that inflation is indeed waning and has reached its peak before further accumulation for long term holdings.🛎Chinese stocks get cheaper📉After the release of our weekend edition on Chinese stocks  we have seen further downward pressure on Chinese equities. There is growing concern that China could be pulled into Russia’s war when more cities in China are facing lockdown as Covid-19 infection rose sharply.Then came the ultimate bomb as Tencent Holdings may be hit with a record fine. This causes regulatory concerns to the surface and is sufficient to evoke a widespread sell-off.🧸Political risk🗽China is in a dilemma. While it is trying to publicly support Russia by refusing to call Russia’s action an invasion  it has to tread carefully with western powers to avoid sanctions hitting its shore. Hence the risks are multi-fold from geopolitical to economic and regulatory pressure for Chinese counters.Although China may throw in some life support for Russia’s economy by maintaining its trade tiles on oil  gas  coal and metals  it is expected to be cautious of fostering a closer relationship. After all  its ties with Europe is particularly of great economic importance.🧨Chinese stocks on decline trend⛳️Most of the counters had already been falling for the past 13 months  and the near-term bounce is still not as visible as the end of the Chinese regulatory crackdown does not appear to end anytime soon. Moreover  investors looking at the recent Tencent case is worried about the anti-money laundering violation of the WeChat mobile network.With firmer Covid restrictions and the lockdown of critical ports and manufacturing hubs  the economic cost to tame down infection is mounting. This is bad news for Chinese small businesses  which will already be hit by weaker travel and consumer spending during the CNY season.With the Chinese economic situation souring  after Feb data showed a weak credit growth and a shrinkage in household loans  a chilling effect is indeed happening on the economy that goes beyond the slump in property activities.As usual  Pika World is taking a cautious stance on the trading and investment environment as our portfolio is badly hurt in this downturn.It is 16 March  Wednesday  6.45 am in Singapore and 6.45 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe and healthy week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Alibaba and Tencent preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs combined: SourcesMarch 16  2022 4:48 PMThese would be the first major layoffs since China launched a sweeping crackdown on its tech giants.Read more:https://bit.ly/3tdlBdg,btohqsg
At close to mid-day  the HSI is up 2.3% and CSI300 is up 0.5%. Here are some reasons why there has been a slight bounce in Chinese stocks:- China reported 1 860 new local symptomatic cases on 15 Mar  down from 3 507 the previous day- Chinese ambassador to the US wrote in a commentary in the Washington Post that “assertions that China knew about  acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation”- This follows Chinese denial of claims by US officials that Russia had sought its military assistance in Ukraine.In understanding the direction of Chinese stocks  we could  look out for developments around geopolitical risk  covid risk and regulatory risk. It seems like the news above has provided some optimism around 2 of the 3 risks.,btohqsg
