Because i use the recent 3 months to apply for HLE leh,btohqsg
that was the period your application is right,btohqsg
my mum applied Nov SBF and she was asked to provide payslip from Aug to Oct,btohqsg
What isit for exactly ? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
for record lor  my mum is not taking loan also need to provide them with her payslip which I was puzzled too,btohqsg
I see .. okay thank you so much !,btohqsg
so let's say she's not working at all  she could not have the eligibility to get 2r flexi shortlease ah?,btohqsg
Oh seems like for short lease is 14k,btohqsg
OK so sounds like if a couple earn $14k  they are not eligible to ballot for BTO even if they are not taking loan,btohqsg
what are the options available for the couple then? can only do resale flats is it,btohqsg
