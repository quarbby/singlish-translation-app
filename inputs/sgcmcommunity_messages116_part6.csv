What is warranty right? Usually they cover only total failure in used cars. When they say “all covered” please make sure you ask exactly what it entails.,btohqsg
You can forget about slight leaks and vibrations and sounds etc,btohqsg
Something’s gotta pay for that car salesman and showroom and advertising mah.,btohqsg
Eh no referral fee for that hor!!!,btohqsg
Want to scam also use a lesser well known girl display pic lah!,btohqsg
Don't buy from this dealer.. $500 is the admin fee.  Anyway  what did they do? They already make from selling the car,btohqsg
If u need dealers pm me,btohqsg
They'll make up a lot of excuses to breakdown the fee and convince buyer,btohqsg
There is no “market price” for admin fee,btohqsg

Ya la. Not guarantee leh.. waste time explain to me but tell me no guaranteesRental company deposit 500-800 and 1 mth rentalBrand new car out liao😂👍,btohqsg
You compare your own offering. One place is 0 do and the other you down as well,btohqsg
Zero dp always has higher admin fees because they usually like to make some money there too in case you can't afford to make payments in the future,btohqsg
"Yup. But should never tell potential customer ""no guarantee""Even if you guarantee the car and penalty of $100 for late payments  or repossession. at least Customer feels better 😂👍",btohqsg
They know the buyer desperate to get the zero dp so will pay the added convenience fees wkwwkwkkwkwkkwwk,btohqsg
"My bank loan， was only approved after trying 3 bank.As customers  at least we felt dealer is really trying their best.Definitely better ""no guarantees"" 😂",btohqsg
I mean they're trying to manage expectations also,btohqsg
You need to remember there's enough and more full loaners going around these days trying to buy cars that they simply cannot afford and it wastes both their time and the dealer's,btohqsg
Because all parties know that they're never getting approved,btohqsg

My current car  VW Golf  was paid in full. Initially  VW wanted to charge me extra 1k for not taking financing. I insisted not paying. Ding dong for a while and she went into the office to talk to somebody. Finally came out and said that is waived. Now  my Holf left with 4 months to drive... COE too high and now I not actively employed... After May will take BMW C+S.😭😭😭,btohqsg
