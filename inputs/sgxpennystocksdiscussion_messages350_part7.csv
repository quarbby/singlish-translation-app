Lifebrandz  BO entry 13  SL 11  tgt 17,btohqsg
Chasen should be consolidating  slow and steady reversing up,btohqsg
marco polo seems to be going for w3?,btohqsg
This Ley Choon now depends on CSC already I reckon. CSC  hope BBs come to take 16. Then power already. They accumulated so many already the CSC BBs. Price 15/16 if maintain  then they should take up 16 soon.,btohqsg
agree and hope soboth csc and marco polo looks so ready,btohqsg

This Ley Choon  pray that it closes at least 18 today. If can  then should be power,btohqsg
they know that 18  not many retailers will take up today. but if BBs close it 18 today. tomorrow morning they just mouth up 18 & 19. Many retailers will chase in 20 & 21 if they do that. They can cash out easy tomorrow morning if they do this. Let see,btohqsg
Hatten land match 39  anyone in this,btohqsg
