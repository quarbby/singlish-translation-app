How many pax you have in total wtf,btohqsg
I thought it was you and soon kueh and a couple of others only,btohqsg
that would have been the case,btohqsg
I know haha I was added to the admin group a year ago to sort out some drama happening in the groups,btohqsg
ya p much a year ago we were like 2/3 times smaller than now,btohqsg
and was promptly kicked out again :(,btohqsg

Bruh yall have a friggin sysadmin to handle your emails,btohqsg

tbh we need a lot of ppl partially cause we're volunteer based,btohqsg
can I be a professional banterer,btohqsg
we don't overload anyone mah  so need more ppl to cover the work,btohqsg
who is actually in charge of career guidance,btohqsg
I'd imagine recruiting people from here who barely made it out into the real world cant really give good guidance,btohqsg
no la  in charge of career guidance doesn't mean they'll be the ppl guiding,btohqsg
bruh I wanna fill it in,btohqsg
we do collabs with different organisations who can provide professionals,btohqsg
like our recent mental health stuff,btohqsg
but it kinda asks for a lot of personal info (or stuff that will divulge your actual identity),btohqsg

it's not like we publish our member list,btohqsg
breh throw me into the holistic development group plzzz,btohqsg
Yea  no one will know one ^,btohqsg
in fact i figure that most of the 50+ ppl that are in the team are anonymous  or lurkers in the community,btohqsg
(this is why we need HR aso HAHAHA need to manage recruitment),btohqsg
i think volunteering in sgexams is q like other orgs in some ways la,btohqsg
anonymity is hard since sometimes we have offline events,btohqsg
its work that needs work to be done  i can say that much,btohqsg

but trust us when we say that we don't want our recruitment process to be this long too,btohqsg
I think i sorta have a clue HAHA,btohqsg
lets just say we wanna know the people we're looking at,btohqsg

Describe the role you envision SGExams playing in Singapore's student community 5 years down the road.,btohqsg
I imagine yall organising student strikes and launching a takeover coup of MOE,btohqsg
we got alot of roles where u don't need like specific skillset,btohqsg
we want to work tgt with them  but at the same time we maintain our independence,btohqsg
since when does MOE wanna work with anyone unless its to strengthen their image or narrative,btohqsg
