can i check when does UOB ONE normally credit the cashback? and is the quarterly system by fixed quarters or based on when you first get your card and spend,btohqsg
Sharing is caring. Mcc can change! Exact same merchant same payment terminal!https://t.me/sgjptravel/115900,btohqsg
Yeah i encounter the same in MY alsoPaid meng meng roasted duck at jb midvalley  same payment terminal1st visit - mcc 5422 freezer and locker meat provisioner2nd visit - mcc 5812 eating places and restaurants,btohqsg

Anybody got cashback for hsbc revo card spend?,btohqsg
Revo is points system. If u want cashback u have to redeem the pts manually,btohqsg
Sorry all  could I check for the ocbc 360 account  is the 3k based on the mab or actual amount please?,btohqsg
Are you talking about the 1% everyday+ cashback?,btohqsg
Did anyone got this ? Is it worth it ? What the maximum amount of $ can earn here ?,btohqsg
UOB One cc will credit the cash back at the statement of the third month.,btohqsg
Yeah the 1% cashback on credit card spend (that should‚Äôve stopped some time ago..),btohqsg
Ok so it seems nobody got it too,btohqsg
I didn't get mine either. Not supposed to get anyway so I was happy when it lasted.,btohqsg
For credit card spend? Was it given the same time they gave the giro cashback?,btohqsg
It is one single entry. I‚Äôm sure I spent more transactions than this one on my HSBC Live+,btohqsg
Do you know which cc spend was it?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt trace as I have many $16.xx transactions. I already tried to trace,btohqsg
I last got it for 15/10 transaction on Revo  then no more.,btohqsg
Same my last cc cashback is oct 10,btohqsg
It may not be that day for the cash back but at least giro we are seeing some cash back ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Frankly I don‚Äôt even know if the amount is for October. If I take the lump sum  seems to match,btohqsg
Mine was 1 Nov. but can‚Äôt trace which transactions,btohqsg
should be 11 to 17 oct,btohqsg
One silly Qs on SC Smart CC. I‚Äôve never redeemed my points. How to do it now that this card is coming to an end?,btohqsg

am currently researching on trust cashback card. not sure if it's worth applying for it. won't really use it here in SG though. in SG i use Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Is it true that ( Original loan - the total amount of all your card's credit limit) = Lower loan amount. Because u have too many cards,btohqsg
Pretty good value I must say. 1% cashback and 3.25% less fcy fee. And potential to use to withdraw cash overseas at ATM (though I'm not sure this is intended application).,btohqsg
yeah leaning to signing up! my CRMC this month has 137 left to 1k. im heading for a short trip the following weekend. thinking of getting the trust cashback card. as always  thanks Anthony!,btohqsg

Hi  I got a upcoming hospital bill to pay... Should I use CC to pay and split into installments to pay interest free  or take a bank loan to pay it?,btohqsg
UserC.‚Äãhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not for doing survey purpose,btohqsg
Sorry to hear. What's estimated amount and what hospital? How much are you able to pay a month?,btohqsg
It depends on many factors. Credit card limits do not necessarily diminish the loan amount you can get unless you have maxed out some of those.Considerations for loans tend to depend on the following but not exhaustive1. Current outstanding - if any2. Age3. Income type and value4. Underlying asset valuation - if any5. Repayment historyThere are certain factors which is specific to the loan types as well.,btohqsg
Can u use medisave to pay? You can also use your parents' medisave if they have too much. Vice versa,btohqsg

Need inputs. Im planning to avail travel insurance. Between MSIG  Allianz  and FWD. or anyone can recommend that you alrd managed to claim. Thanks guys. My concern is more on travel delays or cancellation.,btohqsg
I can only think of paying a fee to CardUp or iPayMy to earn rewards. You can google them and read up to see if this is really something you want to pursue.Both of your cards are not used for CardUp and iPayMy so you will need to apply for new cards which will allow you to gain some benefits from it.The next thing to consider will be the credit limits you can clobber together to make $50k.,btohqsg
Still unsure yet cus it's private hospital... Not too huge amount but I don't wanna tap on personal savings...Im thinking of how to best pay off the balance amount after deduction from my company insurance plan n shield plan...Jus worry about some cash flow issues that's why don't wanna tap too much on my savings...,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! I can still tap on my medisave to pay  jus that there will be a certain amount that I need to pay with cash,btohqsg

One idea   pay hospital using non DBS card. Then pay your CC bills using DBS card. Can buy you sometime for whatever casflow issues you have.,btohqsg
Can use amex cashback card to pay private hospital as part of what treasure hunter suggests. Get some cashback and delay the cashflow.,btohqsg
Any CM link promo ? Teleco,btohqsg
Let me share with you what I did just this year in August. It was a private hospital (Mount E Novena). I paid full amount using Amex True Cash Back. Gave instructions to the hospital to credit whatever insurance and Medisave claims back to me via a bank account.Then I sourced for a 3 months balance transfer to settle the payment to Amex  buying some time for the insurance claims. In the mean time  when the claims came back  I put it in bank accounts earning interest via EGA  UOB One etc.I managed to get a deal from SC Balance Transfer for 0.9% processing fees for 3 months. Net cash back from Amex covered it fully and then some and I had some time to make some interest on the amount too üòäEdit: whatever you do  do not let the hospital pay back to your Amex True Cash Back. You will only make the difference on cash back. They can arrange to credit it into a bank account of your choice.,btohqsg

Why u thumb down my Liang popo?He is correct in fact StarHub owns eight,btohqsg
I thought in your statement did indicate within 30 days? Apparently next day is also within 30 days.,btohqsg
Haha oops sorry fat finger press wrong button,btohqsg
UserTylerhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:irrelevant link,btohqsg
But I think it's strange that starhub doesn't publicly announce that eight is theirs. it's just solely based on eight's website T&C's that we are made to believe they belong to starhub. Starhub annual reports and quarterly reports only mention giga!,btohqsg
Giga is under starhub while eight is renting starhub network  if it makes it clearer,btohqsg
It's similar to ZYM & Heya. Both using Singtel line,btohqsg
ZYM is owned by private company MDR Ltd which leases Singtel‚Äôs network. Eight is directly owned by StarHub Mobile Pte Ltd.,btohqsg
Any source fr this? Can't seem to find it.,btohqsg
Can we wait until Nov 2025 then we cancel the scb smart card? Will not incur annual fee if we cancel 1 month before right?,btohqsg
https://www.eight.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mobile_TnC_01112024.pdfLast page where they define ‚Äúus‚Äù as StarHub Mobile Pte Ltd (Reg. No. 200000646C),btohqsg
Thank you. Was searching online andeight.com.sgis also owned by starhub mobile.Weird that starhub didn't include eight as subsidiary,btohqsg
Eight is newly launched only this year and it should appear in the annual reports of StarHub next year if they‚Äôre truly owned by StarHub. Annual reports are a report on historical figures so you‚Äôll see what happened in 2023 financial year being reported this year.An exception would be if Eight makes a very material impact to the financials of StarHub. Then StarHub has an obligation to report to shareholders.,btohqsg
Yw but the peanut % become worth less already,btohqsg
From the looks eight now put a dent in other muvo all adjusting their perks,btohqsg
More competition is good. I saw someone posted zym is adding more data roaming allowance for their plan.,btohqsg
Still not worldwide roaming data.Eight ftw!,btohqsg
This. But i just moved to Eight!,btohqsg
Eight is still better la. Trust the popo,btohqsg
I try to spend yuu card with gojek. I tot is base reward 1sgd is 10yuu point?But its only 1sgd 1yuu point,btohqsg
are mvnos more skeptical to being hacked? sometimes i see people complaining on social media about how their their numbers can be accessed by hackers,btohqsg
I was on giga last time. Not bad. Their offer isnt the best right now though.,btohqsg
What did they mean by ‚Äúaccessed by hacker‚Äù?,btohqsg
Ma'am  do u think eight good enough for main phone line?,btohqsg
Yup  that's why I was looking at their recent quarter announcements too and there's still just giga! mentioned. Perhaps you're right  maybe eight is just too immaterial for them right now.Perhaps maybe they might divest without damaging their brand too if need be,btohqsg
What is the latest eight promotion?,btohqsg
the sign up rewards only for new to citi customers?,btohqsg
I think at this rate  we might see consolidation very soon like how we saw the OEM competition boomz. 8 dollars a month is really peanuts.. doubt it's sustainable,btohqsg
Yes. Except for Citi prestige I think but citi's own offer may be better,btohqsg
not sure leh  i think it's for those on esim? i saw a post recently. not sure about physical sim,btohqsg
Better check again to see what was the exact issue. Didn't see many reports around that tbh.,btohqsg
mm other than giga  what are other recommended ones? gomo is around the same as gigano m1 because im currently using bespoke m1 and it's very bad. used to be ok network  now whenever im on the mrt  there's no network. certain restaurants also no reception at all,btohqsg
Im on vivifi. It uses Singtel network so all is good. Zym seems decent too and also on Singtel network.,btohqsg
Does it have monthly roaming data?,btohqsg
Depends on plans but very basic. (Like mine only have 1gb in msia  Indo)Thinking of switching,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt use eight for main line because it is mvno and not the 3 main telcos.That‚Äôs my thinking for now. May change in future after more observation.,btohqsg
Nope not existent customer service else if no problem they are okGot one guy couldn't receive otp cause he alleges he was on giga esim and it was hackedhttps://mustsharenews.com/giga-sim-card/So ya own risk with all mvno,btohqsg
i think this was the article i saw previously too,btohqsg
1x yuu points shown here is from just having linked gojek app to yuu account. If use yuu card then get another 9x points+ 26x points if meet 600 monthly spend.,btohqsg
So don't go esim if you want to use it as your banking line I guess,btohqsg
My phone doesn't support esim  so I'm not worried about esim. But trying to see if there are similar incidents for physical sims,btohqsg
I have been with giga for the past 2-3 years but didn't need to contact them until when I need to port my mum in from gomo around March AprilTheir web form was down and kept failing sing pass verification for 3 days. Need to chat with their customer service but they kept cutting my chat support.I was lunch when they finally answered one of the days but I didn't see my phone for 5 minutes while I was eating then giga just cut my support chatHence the warning,btohqsg
He somehow lost his login details so hacker gained access to his phone. How did 13k loss happen? The hacker needs to hack into banks too. I'm skeptical on this article. Hope there is follow up.If you are worried  use physical sim.,btohqsg
All I am saying is their customer support is non existent so probably do your own risk assessment.On normal usage the past 2-3 years they have not got any outage issues for me personally,btohqsg
Ok. Not having 2fa is a bit crazy.,btohqsg
Noted  so what are you currently using right now? Still giga or did you change to another Telco/mvno?,btohqsg
Might change to 8 due to the data allowance. Hoping giga will feel competition and just upgrade my 10 dollar plan though,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtdoes eight login have 2 factor authentication?,btohqsg
Can consider ZYM (using SingTel line). They lowered their price to 7.77 a month.,btohqsg
Form where I am  I may switch to eight first from vivifi to test water. If thing doesn't work out  I'll go to zym.,btohqsg
Both VIVIFI and ZYM are MVNO using SingTel's network... They will probably have the same prioritisation  and definitely the same coverage.,btohqsg
Yes. I need to port in from non singtel for promo. May as well try eight üòÅ,btohqsg
oh! do they have monthly roaming data that refreshes?,btohqsg
So the another points is only reflected after?,btohqsg
Am using Simba and it's supposelingly the 4th telco but the coverage is pretty sucky. Am thinking to change to Eight too. They have pretty good free roaming monthly and cheaper,btohqsg
For the uob prvi amex requirement to hit 50k min spending over 12mths for 20k miles and waiver of AF  can i confirm that mccs that dont get uni$/mileslike educational payments  hospital  insurance  etc. would still be included in this 50k min spend?I tried searching this group chat history and the uob t&cs but couldnt really find a precise answer.

Still can use till next year march. Then cancel. üòÅ,btohqsg
4% till March 2025 for under 800$ spend. Not 6% but not too bad. After that no more 4% then cancel.https://t.me/HMSGHive/2081,btohqsg
Total useless card after dec. Where got not bad. It is bonus cat 4% under 800. Might as well go for other card like maybank fnf. Or the new dcs flex card.,btohqsg
I think you are a bit harsh. It's still 4% (drop from 6%) no min spend from Dec to march. Maybank fnf 8% still needs 800$ spend.But yes  after that  it's useless.,btohqsg
DCS Flex can use CardUp to fulfill $416.67 of online spending. CB 6%-1.85%Then contactless transaction for entire month just need a modest $183.33 to fulfil min $600 spend. Still get 6% CB. Imo even better than 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
No. Scammers using the add to Uber trick. (No OTP required). Then upon successfully added they will make a transport / food purchase,btohqsg
4% for such transactions which other cards can get higher‚Ä¶ a bit sad I feel. üòì,btohqsg
its main selling point is no min spend. When SC axes that  to the bin it goes.,btohqsg
Call me cynical or snarky.But if u are unable to hit min spend. How can u hit the minimum block within a reasonable time frame.,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
I m stuck in the first step lol,btohqsg
I have the same thoughts that the person‚Äôs credentials were compromised  and perhaps credential reuse too across all his accounts  which suggests allowing the hackers to access his bank accounts.One thing giga could have done better was to only allow installation on new device after the old eSIM is removed from old device  like how GOMO and MyRepublic does it. The current way seems to deactivate the old eSIM upon activation of new eSIM.,btohqsg

That‚Äôs the mass market segment together with Advance. I‚Äôm thinking possible for the $120k segment?Just my own speculations,btohqsg
my own theory is that they were fixing incorrect 1% cashback for credit card spend. Then accidentally f up giro cashback 1%,btohqsg
Also possible. I am looking at their VI card in particular and the Live+ could be a market test before they adjust it.The VI offering currently is a mess with removal of step-up program and leaving it in a very ‚Äúpoor‚Äù state in terms of earn rate. Then they changed their Premier card to be AF based and no longer free and earning miles ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
You all think too much.. I say my guess most accurate... The guy doing the calculation on MC üòõüòõüòõüòõ,btohqsg
Is it worth to pay oversea hotel using UOB prvi to get 2.4miles. Or is it more worth I using YouTrip pay the hotel cost? As I did hold any other travel related CC.,btohqsg
exactly. I heard nov giro hasnt received 1% yet. Maybe the guy is still doing excel spreadsheet üôÇ,btohqsg
I‚Äôm buying Toto as a hedge for the loss. Bless me ok?,btohqsg
Maybe someone accidentally delete the spreadsheet... Now need to export again,btohqsg
what is your value of miles? then you calc to see if the miles earned are worth the 3.25% cost compared to youtrip,btohqsg
Cost per miles is 1.35 which is still acceptable for me. The recently UOB prvi promotion only get 5 miles on dining and shopping with minimum spend in $1 500. üòÇ,btohqsg
It seems you have ur answer üòÅ. Acceptable cost then go for it.,btohqsg

"Hi  I‚Äôm a bit confused about the definition of ‚Äúonline shopping‚Äù for the UOB KrisFlyer credit card. I‚Äôve heard that many people recommend this card for large purchases but the terms and conditions state that online shopping applies only to fashion websites that sell clothing  shoes  jewelry  etc.So if I were to purchase a water dispenser from Tiktok shop (MCC is 5399)  will I get 3mpd since it's ""decided by the merchants and their bankers""?Thanks in advance!!",btohqsg
MCC is in the t&c you sent,btohqsg
Ok so follow mcc instead of the definition (fashion websites)! Thanks!,btohqsg

I didn‚Äôt see properly earlier  paid through the app via AXS.. hahaha,btohqsg

Hi guys  just wanna check for minimum spend (for rewards or monthly for cashback)  do we usually need to meet inclusions and exclusions list? Or just any spending to hit that amount can count?(mainly checking for first-time rewards  yuu's 600 and mb fnf 800 monthly),btohqsg
exclusions list usually wont count towards min spend. If you meant non bonus category spend  dbs yuu still counts as eligible spends towards 600$ req.,btohqsg
is it work with recurring payment on CRMC?,btohqsg
For DBS YUU if i use it to pay SP Utilities   does it count towards the $600 minimum spend?,btohqsg

Anyone went to Tiger's Project Play last weekend to sign up for the 6.8% p.a return? They told me have to wait 24 Nov for the 6.8% coupons and $100 shopping vouchers to be in. That's like an extra 10 business days returns lost earning only 3% p.a parking at Philips Money Market . What's the overall nett return after including non business days and 9-23 Nov?,btohqsg
Lol. I withdraw immediately after deposit,btohqsg
So nett return is about 4.5% p.a before including the period 9-23 Nov. Still better than chocolate and hsbc I guess,btohqsg
I am not sure when they start to calculate ‚Äú6.8%‚Äù. The day you deposit or the day you apply the coupon. If excluded 9-23 Nov  return will be a bit lower than 4.5%-4.6%.I did not participate.,btohqsg
That's why deposit 10k is good enough.,btohqsg
But u withdraw immediately after deposit  do u still get the $100 shopping vouchers?,btohqsg
Of course. Read terms and conditions. It doesn't ask you to hold. Only ask you to make a deposit,btohqsg
Have to do 10trades before you can withdraw the 6.8%.,btohqsg
That day I asked the staff on site  she say wouldn't get if withdraw prior receiving their email with shopping voucher,btohqsg
They just want you to hold without withdrawing.  Anyway you don't need. Just read through the whole T&C . Even term and conditions doesn't say anything about holding it,btohqsg
4.5%/4.6% is still a good interest rate. Most banks do not offer this rate anymore.,btohqsg
I got 5.5% from (6.8%*60/90+2.8%*30/90). Based on 60 working days and 30 we/ph earning mmf rate,btohqsg
Yea I also dumped into Philip MMF after deposited into tiger trade. 5.5% is good  better than bonds. Thanks.,btohqsg
I thought the total return after factoring in MMF return is $1117.80 as indicated in the TnC after 60 trading days ?Not sure how to interpret the TnC. My interpretation is after 60 trading days  you get about $1117.80(including the daily interest +  guaranteed return from coupon).,btohqsg
Yeah it's also unclear to me. 4.5% is correct if they just take 1117 net off whatever change in fund nav after 60 trading days. see if anyone else have past exp with tiger 6.8%,btohqsg
I wonder if they want to us to move to non credit card cashless payment like paynow and the likes.,btohqsg
The lady staff at Suntec did tell me to subscribe to Philips MMF to earn more than the promo rate 6.8%  so you are correct to also include 2.8% for the 60 working days + period 9 Nov-23 Nov,btohqsg
The problem for big households like mine. We share our cards.So one main card eg Uob one. We can share among 4-5 people now. Using a mix of physical and applepay.Of course we share cards all with permission from the main card holder.Hope the new developments don‚Äôt mess up our strategy.,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB Lady's card  does the 10X UNI$ for every S$5 spent apply to every transaction or the total amount transacted at the end of the month?,btohqsg

Hi Guru   one question . If I pair amaze +citi reward and pay telecom on reoccurring  does it still contribute to the mile ?I understand citi rewards doesn‚Äôt allow reoccurring.,btohqsg
amaze doesnt change the mcc. If citirewards doesnt give points for recurring  it will be same thing when you use amaze,btohqsg
Recurring sometime is processed as offline transactions  so OP actually meant using Amaze to bypass offline to turn the recurring transaction to an online transaction.,btohqsg
Then we will need to look at the nature of the transaction if it in the inclusion list.,btohqsg
can if mcc and merchant not in exclusion list,btohqsg
Hi Everyone Does anyone have a consolidated list where we can use Instarem Amaze combined with City card to get 10x points ?,btohqsg
get the tnc from Citibank on citirewards what is inclusion and exclusion list,btohqsg
It's a blacklist card so it's better to check for what is excluded.,btohqsg
main thing is travel related transaction are excluded. Not including dining unless the resturant is part of the hotel,btohqsg
Have a second card to fill up that gap to get miles from travel related transaction,btohqsg
Just know in general  hotel  airline and coach are not included. These are the big expenses for travel that you dont want to pay with citirewwards,btohqsg
anything gets 10x points so long mcc is not in exclusion list e.g. travel related.,btohqsg
Anyone know how long UOB CC takes to deliver after approval,btohqsg

They are valid for 5yrs + 3 months and pegged to the day you got your card. If you cancel  then the points are lost so use them before cancelling.The points will all have the same expiry independent of when you earn them so take note.,btohqsg
cool thanks .. so if my card valid thru year is 2026 .. does that mean till then ?,btohqsg
Bro  I think Anthony gave the better answer which is ask CSO if you cannot remember when you first got the card.,btohqsg

If one has the UOB Preferred Platinum  DBS Women‚Äôs and the Citi Rewards  what‚Äôs the best usage of Citi Rewards to get 4mpd  if anyone has it and knows?,btohqsg
Anything non travel when tagged to amaze,btohqsg
How UOB PPV and DBS WWMC related to Citi Rewards usage? üòÖ,btohqsg
I prefer Citi pts (more transfer partners) but dbs wwmc has a need to accumulate pts fast. Considering those  for online id use dbs wwmc till max the Citi rewards. For offline spend  I would use Citi rewards + amaze to max then use UOB ppv.,btohqsg
Hi Guys  anyone know about Mari credit card. ? Anyone using it ?,btohqsg
Hi all  is it possible to do HSBC EGA giro to SRS account monthly that I requested in GIRO form?,btohqsg
Hmmm. Dont think it works that way. Giro is for paying bill and there is no bill to pay herez,btohqsg
Essentially how to spread out usgae across cards.Example do air tickets through DBS Women‚Äôs and online transactions on both  this way even if exceeding the limits  can accrue points.,btohqsg
If your spending isn‚Äôt much  I would focus on one card to avoid orphan miles:Citi Rewards is best option  since it can be paired with Amaze and can be used for offline things. Disadvantage is the cap.DBS WWMC is least favourable: cannot be paired with Amaze  online only  1 year validity of points. The only advantage among these 3 is its higher cap.UOB PPV in my opinion is useless if used standalone. It has limitations ($5 rounding  mobile contactless or online whitelist MCC) and cap. It‚Äôs best if you are pairing it with UOB VS and UOB Lady‚Äôs  since UNI$ is pooled.,btohqsg
What you are suggesting is a standing instruction to transfer funds from A to B. What hsbc wants is for giro payment to get the billing org to draw funds from EGA,btohqsg
hello guyswhich cards would be better to clock points in FCY spend (dental treatment + haircut in jb)?- HSBC travelone- HSBC revolution- CRMC + Amaze,btohqsg
Crmc i guess if it dont exceed 1k,btohqsg
Ok noted. So it is standing instruction instead of giro.,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ Quarterly cashback is in,btohqsg
Isnt this the max amt? üí™,btohqsg
Wish it had no cap üòÇ,btohqsg
What card to use for big ticket housing items?,btohqsg
Me too man. The card is really easy to use.,btohqsg
hey guys quick question!if i use CRMC to pay say UOB Lady's CC bill  i do get the 1% cashback for the next statement month when CRMC bill is paid via EGA  is that correct?im still waiting for UOB to respond on the interbank GIRO applicationsame concept applies to using other CCs that have bill payment done via EGA GIRO  used to pay for other CC bills?EDIT: for future readers  we cannot use a credit cardCC to pay the bill of another CC,btohqsg
Can you buy them online? If you can  Citi SMRT is good for $12k per membership year cap and gives 5% cash back.You can also buy HeyMax vouchers which code as MCC5311 departmental store and use the vouchers physically. A lot of cards gives rewards on 5311 and HeyMax gives you the chance to split the purchase into many cards.,btohqsg
Cannot pay CC bill using another CC,btohqsg
Sad I need to buck up.,btohqsg
Btw  it is based on transaction date actually  unlike other HSBC cards. Same method as HSBC Visa Platinum and HSBC Premier (when it was a cashback card) used to calculate the cashback.,btohqsg
Oh yes I totally forgot about that üòÇ thanks Oscar!,btohqsg
For welcome rewards that require min spend + annual fee (UOB prvi) what happens if I make the min spend but 2 months later I get a refund for one of the transactions?,btohqsg
U need to make up the spend and try appeal if they claw back,btohqsg
But the time period was already over and I‚Äôve paid for that statement alr,btohqsg
U can read tnc  there is clause on subsequent refund tnc,btohqsg
Mine only 100+ but because of this.. I can provide verification that it is calculated based on posted date. Instead of the transaction date that the cso told me.,btohqsg
If this information is impt to anyone of you..cos I wanna know how much balance to keep for the last month of the quarter..,btohqsg
Each voucher will have a certain value. Just use different cards to purchase the vouchers,btohqsg
Are you sure that you don‚Äôt have non-eligible spendings? Cause transaction date perfectly works with my calculations.,btohqsg
My calculation is exact. I have 3 transactions on 30 sep that are only posted on 2 oct and those do not count to this rebate..,btohqsg
Yours got posting different quarter like mine?,btohqsg
Oh u maxed out. Wow.. so how did you know it's transaction date then? Yours is exact?,btohqsg
I keep tracking and spend exactly or close to it.Also I link it to heymax and check MCC to make sure it is eligible spending.,btohqsg
Hmmm I track in excel and also check in heymax.. but my way to finally determine is the last 3 transactions (which will get me about $8 cashback) made on 30 sep and only posted on 2 oct..,btohqsg

Hello! I‚Äôm currently in JB and found out my Instarem amaze card can‚Äôt tap at the petrol station pump. Need to finish pumping then go in to pay via counterAnyone experienced before?No issues with my revolut in the past. Is there a setting I need to do?,btohqsg
Base on my experience  foreign debit cards not accepted  if must go to counter and pay for petrol before pumping.,btohqsg
Hey guys  is the principal sum of 20k guaranteed in choc finance or still subject to market fluctuations,btohqsg
Tried before at 2 different petrol stations. Told the attendant that I am intending to pay with a card and attendant then starts filling up and said to go to counter for payment after it was done.,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs my current experience. With revolut I can just tap at the pump and start pumping straight,btohqsg
For people using eight telco  how long is the porting process? I have a trip next friday so not sure can finish by then.Right now they have promo first month credit is free I think üòÅ.,btohqsg
1-2 dayseSIM is fasterPhysical SIM need to receive it before porting starts,btohqsg
Boss  you are using eight too? üòú,btohqsg
Same day for me very fast. I collected physical SIM card 8pm. By 12mn already port over,btohqsg
Eunos collection outlet is better.Tampines collection outlet very arrogant,btohqsg
After receiving physical sim card in around 3-5 working days and then activating it  the porting over process took slightly more than 1 day and the promo credit gets credited very quickly after you activate the physical sim card.,btohqsg
Ah I see. Is this for delivery?,btohqsg
correct  if you opt for physical sim card to be delivered to you,btohqsg
Ok thanks all. Ill prob opt for self pickup. üëçüëç,btohqsg
Guys any new promotion best deal for home boardband if any thanks,btohqsg
If you need home line   I think m1 so for the best,btohqsg
6 Gpbs plan think More worth it as you got the Tp link be850 router,btohqsg
If no need home line just buy data card and use sim card online??,btohqsg
I ported from circles to eight within 1 week. During the $0 88 day promo period.,btohqsg
Amazing didnt know that. It seems I don't see a per day plan at all,btohqsg
Then I'll do it after my trip to be safe.,btohqsg
I didn't like the idea all the wifi home line need 24 months contract. Well if I just use a data card maybe sufficient... a 8 dollar per month on eight gives 288gb  so I just need to figure out how to link the sim to the notebook,btohqsg
Ah maybe I just need to buy a e-sim wifi router at home,btohqsg
In theory ya. But don't think any lte/sim wifi router has good coverage for home env  like going through walls/etc.,btohqsg
Using eight mobile at taipei now   good connection,btohqsg
How's your experience with eight? The 18 per month 558gb looks good to me!,btohqsg
Woo good news. Do u use a mobile router?,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt recommend eight sim for home wifi usage la. Meant for mobile phone in my opinion. See what the tech pros say,btohqsg
Very good for mobile phone usage. Especially can call back Singapore landline when overseasNo experience for home sharing.,btohqsg
Eh no   I just use the roaming,btohqsg
Can i just clarify if I sign up a credit card and just hit the minimum spending for the rewards and afterwards not use the credit card anymore. Then i cancel after the minimum holding period  will my credit score be affected?,btohqsg
I think as long as you have got a credit card they will gave u a open line no matter you use it or not  it should affect your credit scoring. After you cancel it I think it will take some time before the system update back,btohqsg
so its not recommended to just get the card for the rewards and leave it?,btohqsg
Leave it alone then ok I think. I'd be too worry about credit score in Singapore. Use and pay your bills on time then you will be fine.,btohqsg
Hi guys. I took part in DBS cards season of savings promotion where Marriott hotel is under one of the eligible spend but I realised that the MCC is 6513 for the Marriott hotel I stayed in Dubai. Is there any chance to appeal by providing the invoice?,btohqsg
Anyone know the current fcy fee on amaze (MYR if it matters),btohqsg
was just searching up on Amaze for MYR too.. if i use CRMC + Amaze in malaysia  may i ask what will be the overall fees? amaze converts MYR to SGD. Citi would charge 3.25% FCY fee? but because amaze converted it to SGD. i read this (https://www.instarem.com/help-personal/mcc-fees/) but not too sureim thinking of getting trust cashback card as im about to bust my CRMC bonus points this month üòÇ,btohqsg
You mean the MCC code is 6513. You can try your luck to appeal. But DBS's T&C is very clear that MCC is not under their control,btohqsg
If u use amaze u will bypass CRMC 3.25% and just get charged the amaze fee,btohqsg
Funny I use Maybank f and f direct in jb for food and instead of giving me cb for rinngit use   they overflow my dining cat‚Ä¶ any idea why pls ?,btohqsg
Guess I can only try to appeal. It's a little unfair as it's a Marriott hotel. Didn't know their MCC is different,btohqsg
thanks q! i cant quite find the actual fee.. any luck at your end?,btohqsg
I use amaze in JB for the 1st time last week.,btohqsg
Shld be myr cat. Hmmm. If never use Amaze. Not sure why?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find a way to find the exchange current rate within Amaze  but can only find out by using the card on transactions and anecdotally from other ppl it has been ~2%,btohqsg
Idk if amaze + CRMC is worth it but perhaps since my trust credit card isn‚Äôt a cashback card.,btohqsg
not really amaze fee but about 2.1% mark up compared to mastercard exchange rate,btohqsg
Also not very clear on this but do u mind explaining  so in total the cost of using crmc + amaze is just the 2.1% right  no double charge,btohqsg
Hi guys  if my credit card application is unsuccessful after first attempt  should I reapply again? Will it affect anything?,btohqsg
Wait a few weeks then try again. I got rejected for a SCB card when I applied via MoneySmart/SingSaver  then I reapplied 2 weeks later using the app itself and it got approved.,btohqsg
Wait a few days. I recall there‚Äôs some auto adjustment  though I don‚Äôt know which bucket it will fill first if your MYR spend is one of the 5 cat. Alternatively call up cust svc and they can help you check,btohqsg
Met the income requirement and still got rejected..,btohqsg
How do you apply? When was last time you updated your salary to UOB?Did you hold any uob credit card before last 10 years?Fixed salary or self employed or commission based salary?,btohqsg
What was the sequence? If you spend in MYR first  it will take your dining quota and not your forex quota,btohqsg
which router support 5g speed and sim card?,btohqsg
Alternative to this: tether internet from phone to router. I think many Asus routers support this functionThose more technically inclined: you can flash custom router firmware which supports this function (tomato/dd-wrt),btohqsg
Now broadband really cheap already. Just 20+30 dollar only per month. üòÖStill need to save this type of money? Efficiency also matter.,btohqsg
Contract vs no contractSo you really need to compare apples to apples. That means  compare 24 mth vs 24 mth costI think the use case for getting internet is....1. Require more stable connection2. Have a bit more budget3. Use a lot of smart appliances at home that rely on internet connection (e.g. CCTV  washing machine  air purifier)4. Gaming/streaming (requires lower latency,btohqsg
The main advantage of using a SIM as home internet is the flexibility  in addition to the money savingsUsually  you pay more  and you get more flexibility. But in this case it's not true. You pay more  you get better quality/stability/reliability  butnotbetter flexibility,btohqsg
Just get broadband or what. Don't really need to save this type of money. Internet use everyday. Reliability more important.,btohqsg
Anyone got latest youtrip referral code  can give,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
That's for you. You clearly prioritise reliability (and I agree with you that broadband is more reliable)But it doesn't mean there are no pros or you should just ignore the pros of SIM being a home broadband replacement for others...I did it for a while because I was prioritising flexibility/cost,btohqsg
Can I use Citi SMRT card to buy iPhone at Apple Store app?,btohqsg
my broadband is MyRepublic. during peak periods (evening)  the streaming speed to US sites can get throttled. So I need a backup 5G sim card,btohqsg
Hi  I notice nowadays purchases from Taobao CN are coded based on underlying MCC and no longer based on Marketplace MCC..Recently bought a sofa from Taobao CN and unfortunately 5712 (furniture) is not in PPV whitelist.Has anyone successfully appealed to UOB to get the bonus 3.6 mpd? Thanks.,btohqsg
Dont think you have a case here unfortunately. UOB ppv has a specific list for online purchases.,btohqsg
Oh is it.. I was under the impression it used to be like Shopee that codes as Marketplace,btohqsg

hi everyone  would like to enquire on 2 things here1 ) For those NSMen that has served their ICTs  how long did it take yall to received the  NS HOME award (the 5k CPF & $500 lifesg credits) from the day of completion of your milestone ICTs ? Enquiring as I intend to do a re-allocation of my CPF OA investment portfolio and would intend to include this NS Home portion into it2 ) For those that are investing their CPF OA into T-Bills   with the rate cuts expected to reduce the yields of  T-bills  what are yall intending to re-allocate these capital to once your current T-bills have matured ? Currently having a 65 % T-bill and 35 % equities allocation for my OA. Saw that Endowus offers some fixed income funds for OA investing and was wondering if they'll be a good option to re-allocate my current T-bill component into it once it matures .Thanks !,btohqsg
Oic. That means $45 + $20 = $65/per month and get xiaomi TV?,btohqsg
If both are maxed out  which is the next as I am looking for alternatives,btohqsg
Hsbc ega or standchart esaver need to rotate ard,btohqsg
Really depends on how much money you have and how much jumping around you want to do.,btohqsg
U will receive the $250 possibly 2 months after quarter ends.U can‚Äôt cash out. U have to spend the cashback.,btohqsg
For myself once t bills drop below 3% I would stop the CPF party and just transfer back everything into CPF OA and earn 2.5% pa until I have a need for next housing.,btohqsg
I see that the bonus interest for hsbc ega is only credited 2 months later? Range of 3% to 3.5% for bonus.Am not sure whether I have missed out  but is there a minimum mthly increment to hit in terms of MAB ?Is it as simple as meeting the incremental MAB for months  Nov and Dec and the bonus interest will be credited on 28 Feb 25 ?,btohqsg

For Personal Banking2 criterions are to deposit at least 2K and make 5 eligible transactions via eligible hsbc credit card or hsbc debit card. The incremental ADB will earn 3.05% in all eg  0 in Oct  10K in Nov  the diff of 10K will earn the 3.05%Fulfilling the 2 criterias will allow one to earn additional 1% cashback on all eligible spends on my hsbc debit card and another additional 1% bonus interest on the incremental ADB for eg 10K based on the abv example. Capped at 300 respectively.I can choose to opt out for the 1% cashback on all eligible spends on my hsbc debit card but will still be eligible for the 1% bonus interest on the increment ADB right ? Meaning The minimum interest is 4.05% based on the incremental ADB ?Is this right..? üòÇ,btohqsg
hi all! wanted some advice abt managing my finances - first jobber out of uni  currently holding dbs multiplier (salary crediting acc bc of company limitations unfortunately) and sc jumpstart (opened this before uni). im wondering if i shld:- keep my sc jumpstart acc and focus on accumulating emergency funds till i hit the 50k cap  then move onto smth else- apply for credit cards - avg spend will be around 1k-ish range  mostly on food  transport and membership/subscriptions (bft training etc) bc occasionally shop here and there. keen on the miles game for travel perks but was wondering if i wanna have 2 credit cards (1 miles and 1 cashback) to see what i prefer eventually. would love insights + card recommendations for this.thanks lots!,btohqsg
By the way  5 eligible transactions can be 5x fast transfer out too  don't need to be card transactions.üòÅI've been setting up standing instructions 2k in then 5x 400$ out every beginning of the month.,btohqsg
Thank u. Useful and smart tips.Their website can be confusing.,btohqsg
Can't comment much on saving acct.For credit card  better focus on 1 side  either cashback or miles. Straddle 2 sides and you may end up not getting enough miles to redeem within reasonable amt of time. üòÖCan consider something like Citi rewards + amaze to start first. It's capped at 1k and allow 4mpd on many things  excluding public transport and travel booking.,btohqsg
If cashback  UOB one saving acct + uob one cc can be a consideration.,btohqsg
I might have misunderstood.Your point of 2k in and then 2K out (5 transactions) is to zeroised the balance for month end so that the increment ADB remains at 2K right ?,btohqsg
I'm keeping mine at 2k minimum balance in case I need to do UOB promo or ocbc reset month.,btohqsg
Oh but that means is 81 dollars on a yearly basis. Is not exactly the account you used to max benefits.,btohqsg
I see. Don‚Äôt really understand but thanks for sharing,btohqsg

I am considering heat tech from uniqlo but my friends were saying I can consider winter clothings from taobao,btohqsg
Still  the criteria to qualify for ega is the same.,btohqsg
Not to mention I am clueless about layering,btohqsg
Concept is multiple thinner layers  like 2-4 to more.For clothing  I'm skeptical to get online cuz can't try  not sure about comfort. You better ask ur friends how shop from taobao üòÅ. They may be experts.,btohqsg
It is true. I am also worried if it works or fit me. Just that I can't convince myself to spend a few hundreds for a possibly one time trip,btohqsg

Layering:22¬∞C and above: T-shirt12-21¬∞C: T-shirt + thin fleece layer / pullover / hoodie5-12¬∞C: T-shirt + thin fleece + light synthetic jacketBelow 5¬∞C: Uniqlo heat tech + T-shirt + thin fleece + light synthetic jacketNo layering:22¬∞C and above: T-shirt0-21¬∞C: T-shirt + high-fill down jacketBelow freezing: Heat tech + T-shirt + down jacketThe concept of layering is to allow you to feel more comfortable as the temperatures get colder/warmer throughout the day  or as you transition indoors/outdoors. For example if the temperature's at 15¬∞C  you might feel too cold with just a t-shirt  but also too warm with a high-fill down jacket.,btohqsg

CorrectYou just need to have sufficient credit limit on your citi rewards card,btohqsg
Now best 4MPD strategy is- Instarem + CRMC- UOB PPVAm I right?,btohqsg
Can I suggest you adopt either Citibank or UOB for miles? It will eliminate orphan points.What‚Äôs your rough spending per month like and centred around what transactions? Categories will do. Groceries  petrol etc,btohqsg
$2k on food and shopping? Hotels and flights excluded,btohqsg

Hi can I check usually how many days it take for Maybank sg to approve credit card application for new to bank customer? Just wondering if apply now can get it before my trip to Malaysia next Mon?,btohqsg
Can I suggest a combination of UOB Lady‚Äôs card and PPV?PPV is capped at $1 110 per month with no minimum spend. Use it for payments only via watch  phone etc can easily get 4mpd. (Do not take physical card and tap)Lady‚Äôs card is flexible depending on needs (select category) and has no minimum spend and capped at $1k/$2k (Normal/Solitaire).Another one to try will be UOB Visa Signature which has a minimum spend of $1k capped at $2k for 4mpd.,btohqsg
The UOB UNI points will consolidate so it will make it very easy to convert into miles. Take note of expiry.Citibank ThankYou points tend to have a longer expiry period but the only great card to earn miles is Citi Rewards for 4mpd and it‚Äôs capped at $1k spend a month. Citibank points are also annoying because they don‚Äôt consolidate.,btohqsg
Make sense. But CRMC + Amaze can convert FCY spend to local. So can use overseas.But UOB pooling points is very good. Though the UOB PPV is reward miles for every $5,btohqsg
I got schooled on this one by Anthony awhile back üòäLady‚Äôs card and Visa Signature is very forgiving on that front as the bonus points are awarded by calendar month. So it will consolidate the spend and calculate bonus points.PPV is awarded immediately upon posting so you‚Äôll feel the $5 block more,btohqsg
Hahaha make sense. Maybe VS is the way to go.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt really fancy lady‚Äôs at this point. Cuz only can select 1 category. Maybe when I get pay raise den i go straight to solitaire,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt recall seeing it. Did you login to check?,btohqsg
You‚Äôre cutting it very close. I think good chance you‚Äôll miss since they don‚Äôt issue digital cards first and you need to wait for the physical card.Could be a better idea to use YouTrip or Trust or Amaze + CRMC combo.,btohqsg
can we use Citi reward  + Instarem method for Alipay?,btohqsg
Q hard  because they don‚Äôt have digital card and need physical card by snail mail. + you NTB so likely need do some credit and KYC checks. Usually more than 1 week lead time one.Best you can do is to keep calling Maybank hotline lol,btohqsg

Hi anyone have experience cancelling uob credit card application  while not forfeiting the sign up bonus? So that can use next time,btohqsg
What do you mean? ü§îDo you mean card churning? It's kinda pointless doing with UOB.,btohqsg
Not card churning  my friend accidentally applied for a UOB card for a big payment  but found a better alternative to get more miles. But now she‚Äôs wants to cancel the application before it‚Äôs even approved so that she can sign up again in a few months for the new to bank sign up bonus,btohqsg
Call UOB I guess. But can't control. once her card is approved  timer for new to bank will start. And she may not get approved again in the future.,btohqsg
I see  so will it be better if she cancels after getting the card and waiting for 6 months to refresh her new to bank status?,btohqsg
not what i meant. I suggested calling uob/go to branch and try to cancel the application.,btohqsg
No so straight forward ‚Ä¶ most of the T&C state u cannot cancel a card within 12 months prior to the application . Some only require 9 months (like maybank). Some offer existing custom with small onboarding gift‚Ä¶. But if u cancelled and apply during the 9-12 months period   u r neither a new applicant nor an existing customer ‚Ä¶ üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Oh  but worst case scenario after 12 months she can be considered new applicant?,btohqsg
Typically she cannot have any existing cards or account with the bank   if I recall correctly,btohqsg
i just want to say. Get approved for a card then cancel it right away may affect your future application  even if you refresh ur new to bank status.,btohqsg
Really need to read the T&C carefully,btohqsg
I see  ok thanks all  I will ask her to go to branch to cancel the application if possible,btohqsg
Yea this is good. Hsbc ultra short term bond earns a return of avg 4.2% / p.aBut their 1.8% booster is only good for $50k.
