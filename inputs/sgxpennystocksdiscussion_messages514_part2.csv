Pika World Daily Update 20 August 2021Markets were MixedEquity markets continue to feel the wrath of the tapering and Delta variant concerns. The state of the US monetary policy and the global growth engine appears to have soured.The Initial Jobless Claims had dropped to 348 000. This is a new low  which is much better than what economists had expected. Before the data was announced  most indices were red. Nonetheless  it appeared that concerns on the economy continued to linger as around 56% of the S&P 500 stocks retraced during the trading session. Value stocks that were more sensitive to the economic demand had a big hit.Russell 2000  which is Pika World favourite  hit the most  down by 1.25%  as they are most affected by any signs of slowing growth.Signs of Exhaustion and New RealityThe revelation of FOMC July’s meeting added to the broader worries on economic growth  and in the face of the Delta variant  investors’ sentiment is dampened. As a result  the buy the dip paused as market participants anticipated lower liquidity in the market than expected when the massive monthly bond purchase slowed down.Caution appears as the market hates the uncertainty on the timing and the pace of tapering coupled with weekly delta cases growing worldwide. While a slight rebound can be seen in the market  this is mainly because most investors had anticipated some form of signal to a change in policy and thus were positioning for some dip.Consumers changing BehaviorOn uncertainty  it is debatable if the current high inflation is starting to erode consumer demand. For one  the safety restriction globally continued to limit supplies  increase producers’ inout cost  and put upward pressure on selling price. This is seen in the recent PPI data.Then  the weaker retail sales data last week almost seal the softer consumption sentiments  though households may have switched to other forms of consumption  and more data will be needed to pan out the narrative.Trajectory and ExpectationIn the light of the weaker equity sentiment  Pika World has for the past 2 weeks encouraged the rotation to defensive sectors of the economy  which has deterred considerable deterioration of portfolio assets. As a result  we continue to be positive on US economic health while acknowledging a weaker sentiment is here to stay. Once the certainty of tapering is resolved  the sky might be blue once again.We continue our mild accumulation of strong core stocks  such as Microsoft  which has some tailwinds  as discussed in our Pika World Updates despite a less rosy market. The higher volatility is not uncommon since we have expected boredom to disappear and more significant movement during Aug-Oct seasonally weak market season coupled with the summer season where investors typically see lighter trading activity.It is 20 August  Thursday  8.30 am in Singapore and 8.30 pm in New York. The last trading week has arrived. Pika World hopes you have a safe and sound day ahead!,btohqsg
