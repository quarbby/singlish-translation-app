Actually i was trying to do the 4%  3 months FD by citibank this morning,btohqsg
But they want me to open a savings account first. So troublesome. Then the svgs accoutnt got minimum amt to maintain zzz,btohqsg
IBKR has 'good' SGD - USD rate. There is a fees (think is 2USD) which benefits of the good rate can outweigh the fees. I'm not sure how putting USD in ibkr can yield 4.33%. Can@WhereAreTheBestBananaspls share? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
MAS gave warning that strengthening SGD is bad for SG few days ago though. So i think they wont defend this level,btohqsg
Yah above 10k is 4.33%. On cash.,btohqsg
I dun have 100K AUM with IBKR to meet the IBKR requirements (4.33%). That's non guaranteed return right?,btohqsg
It's tiered. >USD10k cash will earn 4.33% IF your overall AUM with them is >USD 100k.,btohqsg
again.. need see ur commitment period lo  cause SSB virtually is 10 years rate  IBKR yielding 4.3% but idk how long (i didn't really explored this option  so...),btohqsg
Is there inheritance tax risk on this IBKR?,btohqsg
Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!üëâ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I had Pork Ribs Noodles. Nothing much on the food. I realized that more elderly are using Paylah to pay and for those who are learning  they will ask the store owner how to do it. Most are quite willing to help if they are not busy  which is an encouraging sign that we can move to  a more cashless society. Of course  when any incentive is gone  the user base will drop. But at least more customers can learn how to use e-wallet payments instead of cash.Cost of meal: $3.50Cost of drink: $1.00DBS Cashback: ($3.00)Net cost for lunch: $1.50üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
I missed this‚Ä¶. I went to use xnapü§£,btohqsg
Can I circle back to your point you wrote ? I read about this 'analysis' somewhere. I can't find the data points behind the analysis. The data points I found that can relate to low yielding is based on theAnnualised Returnsworked out by Endowushttps://endowus.com/investment-funds-list/fullerton-sgd-cash-fund-SG9999005961,btohqsg
I'm actually very much against how the push towards digitization is being done. It's akin to telling a child to cross the road without teaching them how to look left and right and watching the traffic lights first or akin to just blindly investing in something because it's the new hot thing being talked about without actually understanding the risks first.Not that I am against digitization... but it is SSSOOOoooo important to understand the risks first... always... in all situations.,btohqsg
Just to clarify the low yielding is based on 'lagging data'? Looking at the potential platueu of the Fed 10 year yield  the 7-Day MMF yield may slope down. The SSB fixed rate might be better for folks who want to park cash for predictable future returns? üòä,btohqsg
It's the nature of MMFs. Take the Fullerton SGD Cash Fund that you're considering as an example. Refer to page 77 of the pdf (page 76 of the actual document) Prospectus :https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/admin/buy/prospectus/prospectusFUL007.pdfNote also that the SGD Banks Saving Deposit Rate benchmark ishttps://eservices.mas.gov.sg/statistics/msb-xml/Report.aspx?tableSetID=III&tableID=III.3ANote also that all funds incurs fees from audit  admin  mgmt fees  etc. This further eats into the gains of the underlying investments.,btohqsg
Long term. The investment objectives of this pot are 1) No loss of invested sum. 2) Can liquidate with Obj #1. 3) Minimal admin work to monitor (like rollover).,btohqsg
But the base rate of cash is v low now wat. Yet the one  AG was showing is yielding 3.9?,btohqsg
Sorry.. I'm lost.. which product are you referring too that's reflecting 3.9%?,btohqsg
The MMF that he was showing just now lor,btohqsg
The chart is a 7-day APY shown in the  Moomoo Cashplus. MMF use 7-day. Im aware that it does not pay client 3.9% interest every year.,btohqsg
Oh oh see wrongly. But for now  how they can pay so high if base rate of cash is‚Ä¶ so low. Its equivalent to an FD with promo leh,btohqsg
I am also in the same position now actually. 1/2 my Cash i already place in IBKR  yielding 4.33. The other 1/2 i will place locally  i think if no good options  i just place in t bills.,btohqsg
They try to achieve higher rates through safe investments.. in the case of the Fullerton fund that AG is talking about  part of it is invested into fixed income bonds. This helps to achieve a higher rate of return.. but it does lock in some capital.. as such  they can't allocate too much into that in order to meet liquidity requirements.,btohqsg
Personally  I'd go for SSB. I agree with Joseph  that I doubt interest rates will stay this high for the next 10Yrs (the duration of a SSB).,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I concur with Joseph too. Thanks folks :),btohqsg
Have some ssbSome t billsSome FullertonMost SA Ma,btohqsg
In case people might not be aware  these 2 resources are pretty good for obtaining information on individual a particular fund or bond:For Funds :https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/homeFor Bonds / Fixed Income :https://www.bondsupermart.com/bsm/home,btohqsg
always good to diversify.. But I'm like AG.. the admin of T-bills every few months is just cumbersome  albeit the higher yields... I feel the same for promos like the HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
What do you mean admin? Every 6 months returned liao just place again wat. They just return straight to the bank acct right,btohqsg
Firstly  need to keep track (put in calendar or something).. that in itself is annoying  then  closer to maturity  need to re-explore options again.. and then of course  need to execute the decided action to take... it might seem like little work but still admin work none-the-less.,btohqsg
Anything less than 3.2 is a no no for me if ssbI only bought twice 3.38 and 3.2 last round,btohqsg
Yeah i guess depends. Personally  I just need my money to be locked up for 1-2 years max  after that i will use it to buy property again.,btohqsg
Prudential like the insurance company? What's your investment timeline? I'm not so bullish on insurance industry because of the increasing medical costs and aging population.,btohqsg
Coolz.. my personal threshold is 3%... lolz... but as long as higher then CPF 2.5% I think can also consider. Anything less  don't bother.,btohqsg
Then t bills will be better for 1 year,btohqsg
Any cards on the market that still award cashback/miles for town council payments?,btohqsg
You managed to realize some profits during the high? If you did  well done! üëèüëèüëè Congrats!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fully redeemed very early this week so I missed it üò≠ how early did y‚Äôall usually go for this now? 11am+?,btohqsg
Would there be any problem if my SO link my CRMC to her own Amaze card? Then I spend in SG and she spends in Msia at the same time. She's going msia for a short trip don't want to bring so much cash.,btohqsg
cannot be i took my lunch at 12+ still have leh,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt tell you. Wait you go earlier than me,btohqsg
UOB just increased their cash advance rate fyi,btohqsg
I got mine at 12 sharp (it was just coffee however),btohqsg
I got mine at 12.54pm still got leh,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs against the tnc for amaze. The linked cards need to belong to the same owner as the amaze card. Besides  wouldn‚Äôt it be suspicious if there are different transactions so close to each other but in different countries?,btohqsg
I think is better to call and confirm.A personal experience to share. I thought I cancelled my 2 old scb cards in Apr 2022 and proceed to apply to apply for SCB Smart. Long story short. I discovered the bank actually cancelled the cards on their system in May 2022. I was upset and immediately cancel the SCB Smart because I don't need the card.I'm disqualified from new user promo freebies and have to wait one more year to be considered as new user.,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the TnC of Amaze. Why not apply a supplementary card for your 'SO' and ask her to link her supplementary card to her Amaze?Just for info - If both transactions charged to the same physical card X hours apart from physical locations distant away (such as first transaction at 1 pm at a restaurant  in vivocity in S$ and second transaction at 2 pm to buy a Eurostar ticket in ¬£)  the bank fraud monitoring team would be alerted and customer might be contacted to confirm transactions.,btohqsg
Okay thanks! Yeah I called and luckily still managed to qualify but yeah the date on the email confirmation is not the same as their backend,btohqsg
Great! Now I have to wait for one more year to be considered a new scb card customer üòÇ,btohqsg
