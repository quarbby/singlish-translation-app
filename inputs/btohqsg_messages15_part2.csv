Hello! I'm a reporter and I'm looking to speak with ppl who have BTO-ed several times and failed  or eventually gave up and bought resale. If you're open to sharing your experience with me  do DM me pls  thanks!,btohqsg
drop me a note. i am frustrated and annoyed at this. didn't the gov say they will prioritise those who have continuously failed at the August 2022 BTO? it's my 4th time and still#notachosenone,btohqsg
all 4 times in mature estate or non mature? Non mature  each failure will give you more ballot chances.. but not the same for mature estates,btohqsg
all 4 time in non-mature estates,btohqsg
Sad... 5/6 years ago.. i failed 7 or 8 times.. but also cause my partner and I picky... all matured estate,btohqsg
Be careful when you go public  the government will go into detail what you do and if you are not willing to tell the truth it might back fire you.,btohqsg
Ya and pofma and sue u in court,btohqsg
Not so serious  they just make you a fool.,btohqsg
HDB therefore encourages all flat applicants to select a flat when they have the chance to do so. Those who choose not to book a flat will be issued a non-selection count (NSC).First-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will have their subsequent flat applications moved to the second-timer category for a year.Second-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will not be able to participate in subsequent sales exercises for a year.Additionally  first-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two or more attempts for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates (NMEs) receive an additional ballot chance for each subsequent NME BTO application.Virtually all first-timer families who apply for NME BTO flats are successful within their first three tries.However  the count of unsuccessful NME BTO applications will be reset to zero if a first-timer family chooses not to book a flat when offered a chance to do so.https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/q-as/view/written-answer-by-ministry-of-national-development-on-hbd-bto-applicants-not-choosing-their-flats-and-its-operational-impact,btohqsg

This is so disheartening to learn abt. I had started to do balloting for SBF since last year to downgrade from my existing 4rm to 3rm. Look like it‚Äôs still a long way to go for me especially I‚Äôm not looking for the West location. üòû,btohqsg
What's the minimum number of days to check off 1 year's MOP?,btohqsg
"I generally hear a figure around 182  but I wonder if that has to be all at once  and how they count a ""day"".",btohqsg
"Where u hear this from? From the website it says 1 year  anything less than that they can flip words and say ""we said 1 year""",btohqsg
Unless u got HDB email best is u don't hearsay,btohqsg

That's great  but you saying 365 days is also patently absurd since it implies no one even takes a weekend to Johor. I guess I'll ask the next counter lady I see at the branch.,btohqsg
I don't know what the heck u are saying.,btohqsg
1 year is 365 days no?,btohqsg
If u take ur key on 15 January 2022  1 year MOP is till 14 January 2023. Simple as that. Don't complicate things by saying going to Johor. Unless u want to count the actual number of hours u are at home.,btohqsg
So I don't understand your sentence of me being absurd that no one takes a weekend to Johor. Back to your question  unless u got HDB email as written proof  not he say she say counter say  that your MOP can end early  I highly suggest u don't test their system.,btohqsg
But ofcos u are free to test their system,btohqsg
