Hihi does anybody knows if I earn 4mps for purchasing scoot air ticket by UOB Platinum visa ?,btohqsg

Hi if anyone have any good recommendations on free airport lounge credit card? Prefer a card that annual fee can be waived. Saw some free lounge access credit card annual fee is non waivable,btohqsg
Card comes with 2 x lounge visit per Yr. If waive the Annual fee they won't give you the 10k miles,btohqsg
you mean there will be 10k miles give e every year I pay the annual fee?,btohqsg
But premiere miles earn rate only 1.2 per dollar,btohqsg
You can call in to Citibank every year after your annual fee is charged to have it waived,btohqsg
Is there anyway to waive citi prestige annual fee if we forfeit the renewal benefits?,btohqsg
Prestige I believe its strictly non waivable no?,btohqsg
you are essentially paying for miles,btohqsg
10k for $192 works out to be 1.9 cents or $0.019Let's say you going to japan in Jan and it cost $900  if you go by miles is 90k + $80 tax.So your 90k miles values at (900-80) = $720.0.8 cents or $0.008 per milePay VS Actual Value$0.019 vs $0.008Essentially you are overpaying for the miles. Plus if you already transfer your existing points over  you need to spend another $25 for the transfer fee.,btohqsg
Tokyo 2way now is abt 950.,btohqsg
Depends you want saver + a bit of luck or you want confirm get a seat with advantage.,btohqsg
Well... for me I will only look at saver,btohqsg
That's why people don't usually redeem for economy class flights...redeem for business or first class instead. Want economy better to buy revenue flights. More options.,btohqsg
Yes. Redeem for business or first. Totally agree,btohqsg
Yah. But I donno what is his option mah. But Japan seems to be a popular option for now. Itâ€™s just easy to calculate,btohqsg
Japan is ok but try to redeem for business or first class. Usually less than 4 hours flight miles is not good value,btohqsg
My opinion anything below 6hrs econ.,btohqsg
Econ please play for it. Wait for deals. For redeem please plan ahead.,btohqsg
My premiere miles is basically for lounge and pay annual fee for 10k miles. Day to day use 4miles per dollar card.,btohqsg
Just to clarify  Iâ€™m not the one asking whether to pay annual fee to get the 10k miles. Iâ€™m just putting numbers out there that we need to calculate how much are we paying VS how much it actually values.,btohqsg
Yes I know. I'm not faulting you too,btohqsg
However  recently I got to know a new theory. If a business flight round trip to US may cause 7K. But you will never willing to pay 7K for a business class to US. However you only willing to pay $5K.Thus should evaluate your miles according to 5K.,btohqsg
This whole thing about how much should you value your miles is a very touchy and subjective topic.,btohqsg
At the end of the day is how much you value the ticket,btohqsg
To each his own  as always. ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆEveryone's mile valuation is different; I believe there's plenty of resources by multiple finfluencers on how to calculate that by now. I suggest pple new to miles to at least watch/read to understand the concept and determining your own level of value.It's tough but I had to go thru that motion myself and trust me it's worth the time investment to do that first to avoid future regrets ðŸ˜…Very sensitive topic indeed,btohqsg
Need to do more homework than just cash back,btohqsg
Ever since the nerf of grab and CDC. I'm no longer in the cashback game since I cant hit the minimum spend every month. So now i changed my strategy to points/miles as what Chris shared in his single CC video. And also I'm entering a new phase in new life that gotten me to be interested in miles game.,btohqsg
â€¦ higher expenditure in your fam ? Sounds like a good time to go miles,btohqsg
CDC as in vouchers or crypto?,btohqsg
Might want to travel more with my partner in the future. So thinking of collecting miles first. CRMC has expiry of 5 years from card activation. So not a issue for me.,btohqsg
Although itâ€™s my understanding that all points expire 5 years from the first issue of the card  after 5 years there will be a new round of Citi Thankyou points to earn  letâ€™s hope thereâ€™s still time,btohqsg
Haha  will review again in 5 years time. Maybe I'll need more cashback instead,btohqsg
Yea that is the case with crmc.When transfer to krisflyer  u get another 3 years anyway,btohqsg
Anyone know if any promo for Citibank credit card now?,btohqsg
On the other hand  Citi Premiermiles supposedly has no miles expiry - with a $25+ transfer fee,btohqsg
Amex krisflyer is non Waiveable? Is anyone able to waive it before?,btohqsg

Curious  which brokerages pay interest on idle cash funds?,btohqsg
