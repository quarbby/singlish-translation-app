Yes idk why am i even looking at my email at this hour,btohqsg
you gotta learn to compartmentalise and reason things out with yourself when you‚Äôre stressed,btohqsg
which parts can you actively do smth about? if future rounds are gonna be in crunch periods then isn‚Äôt it all the more reason to work now more so it‚Äôs easier later?,btohqsg
