Friday’s robust U.S. nonfarm payrolls report reduces the probability of Fed rate cuts in the near term  Global Economic & Markets Research team says in a note.

Leader Environmental Tech enters into conditional agreement to dispose shares in AIWater for $67.9 milRead:https://link.theedgesingapore.com/Wtho4yD6yxwnApZd9Follow us on:@theedgesg,btohqsg
As per article 'After fees from the proposed transactions  Leader Environmental Technologies will have a balance of around RMB318.37 million  which will be retained for working capital requirements or plans to enhance shareholder value.On a pro forma basis  if the proposed transactions had been completed at the end of FY2023  Leader Environmental Technologies’ net tangible assets (NTA) per share would have been 25.56 RMB cents from 4.82 RMB cents originally. If the transactions were completed on Jan 1  2023  the group’s earnings per share (EPS) would have been at 18.02 RMB cents compared to a loss per share of 2.72 RMB cents.',btohqsg
IMO  As per this ongoing catalyst  can expect Leader  Env to be active and start to come alive.DYODD and maybe good to keep in watchlist.Feels a tad similar to HLH when it was 41-42 and then deal was real and completed and now 50% higher.However  more for those with holding power as we can expect flush game from the BBs always,btohqsg
