There an article waiting that we can hit 200 k coe by 2030,btohqsg
If you can find the article  do share it here!,btohqsg
Can play The Price is Right? If you guess closest to the premium at closing you will receive petrol vouchers OR a free car of your choice if sgcarmart is feeling generous 🤪,btohqsg
Actually that one idea. We can plan for one in the future. We're working on another interesting giveaway at the moment. Will release details by end of the week!,btohqsg
Can read for fun   but is possible,btohqsg
It an old article in year 2016https://www.torque.com.sg/all-articles/the-200000-question/,btohqsg
And now borders open ! Buy car now go jb pump !,btohqsg
“Earn” back the money spent on paying for a high COE premium🤣,btohqsg
Yes ! 1 week go twice settle all problem   don’t have to shake car also,btohqsg
The car that need 12 hours to update over the air,btohqsg
But if you buy an EV instead  different story liao🤭,btohqsg
I am driving an ev but I go there pump tyre also,btohqsg
What's the figure like for your ride with the rebate,btohqsg
45 k rebate off purchase price lol,btohqsg
EV should have their own COE cat,btohqsg
I think this suggestion must feedback to LTA leh😆,btohqsg
but with the current plans on phasing out ICE vehicles  a special COE cat for EVs will not be feasible🙁,btohqsg
If u buy an ev now u enjoy 45 k cash rebate   u buy ice is pay $15 k onwards more tax   price difference is $60 k   thanks ice car buyer for funding ev cars,btohqsg
So if coe is at 100 k with the 60 k difference   ev car owner is like just paying 40 k coe and ice car owner is paying 100 k coe,btohqsg
That why now ice car buyer are rich ppl,btohqsg
Yes yet ppl in most article will said goverment not helping in promoting ev  the 60 k difference is already so big   where as car omv is on average 30 k,btohqsg
Is it the tax Much higher?,btohqsg
No unless u buy performance 1,btohqsg
Then should be better to buy EV right? Less maintenance too,btohqsg
The battery 🔋 price will come down exponentially,btohqsg
The petrol u save is easily more then the road tax for like a mg that is a around 1k plus yearly,btohqsg
yes. a BYD e6 road tax is nearly twice of similar power ICE cars,btohqsg
Hmmm sian lah COE so high now ... but every 10yrs trend,btohqsg
ev need another 20-30 more years to be mainstream,btohqsg
By then i think I drive the Paper Car alraedy ><,btohqsg
so much rebate.. ev still pricey.. who earns? haha,btohqsg
Car price is expensive in Singapore is becuase of Pepe,btohqsg
Actually why ah? Last time diesel high is cos they pollute the air right?,btohqsg
The petrol thet can’t tax you,btohqsg
rebate all already counted in lah haha,btohqsg
next month they announce 100k rebate  but ev price go up. in the end same. still more costly than ice,btohqsg
The road tax of like $1000 more a year is nothing to petrol saving,btohqsg
went to test MGZS  good car. 140k,btohqsg
diesel higher road tax based on pollution taxelectric higher road tax based on power rating,btohqsg
ya lo all the AD take nia rebates,btohqsg
Ya 140 k can buy what ice car now haha,btohqsg
Want save money choose ev battery is all 8 years factory warrently,btohqsg
exactly haha. and unless u live landed with charger  or hengheng ur hdb mscp got charger. if not wont be practical also,btohqsg
U drive a mg eletric then compare to Mazda 3. I sure u will never want drive Mazda 3 again,btohqsg
you asked for ice car right,btohqsg
and also to account for loss of fuel income,btohqsg
As announced at Budget 2020  the road tax framework for all new electric vehicles (EVs) registered from 1 January 2021 has been reviewed to better reflect current trends in vehicular efficiency and to partly account for fuel excise duties which EVs do not incur  until we are ready to impose a distance-based tax[1].https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2020/3/news-releases/Supporting_electric_vehicle_owners_in_the_transition.html,btohqsg
So in SG now which EV is most Affordable and Reliable? Hmmm,btohqsg
Ya now ev is Best Buy   no sense in even buying ice now,btohqsg
Got MG EV dun want   want to buy Mazda 3?,btohqsg
