That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do but I‚Äôm stuck üòÖ,btohqsg
Or should I wait until it‚Äôs fully processed to get the code/QR and add into the app?,btohqsg
Really depends on the Bank unfortunately I forgot how long it took with Citi. But I would plan 2 statement cycles for this myself,btohqsg
How do I make use of the points if I have not hit 1000points. The transfer option seems to be only for other currency.,btohqsg
How far are you away from 1k?,btohqsg
Very far. I only have 300+ points . Is there a way I can transfer out the 3+ sgd?,btohqsg
You can only redeem with min 1000 points for $5,btohqsg
I received the sms but it shows until 31MAR2025  but yours show until 30APR2025,btohqsg
Is for last month's. Don't have to worry  I never even receive last month's.,btohqsg
Hi all   I have transfer in 2000 then did 5 transfer of 400 each out but I didn‚Äôt. Get this message . How do I trigger the qualification ?,btohqsg
Transfer 2000 in  and 5 out.,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt always get the SMS. As long as you do the 2k transfer in and 5x out  you will get the 1%.,btohqsg
Hello experts  am i able to pay dbs car loan using chocolate card?,btohqsg
As long as you do correctly  trust the process.,btohqsg
Another way to push your luck... Go apply a dbs cc and immediately apply for hsbc giro for that dbs card. Make payment for your citi cc via dbs cc. My recent dbs giro only took like 3wks to be set up so you should be able to get that in time for your 13k to be rolled over for another month or so.,btohqsg
Just to share - MariBank interest will be dropping from 2.5% to 2.28% with effect from 1 April 2025.,btohqsg
Are we still getting Cashback for credit card payments for other banks? I use the giro option to pay,btohqsg
Grrrrr never get !! I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening,btohqsg
Your giro triggered? It's been realiable for me in the past 2-3 months.,btohqsg
My latest cc giro on 28 Feb got 1% cashback credited on 3 Mar.,btohqsg
Hi ppl ... I am holding the  POSB Multiplier Account. I'm able to get 2.1% interest rate most of the time. Don't own any CC. I am thinking of opening up the SAYE Account. Will it be a good idea to park some cash over month and get the 3.5% interest after the 1 year?,btohqsg
think can try pay via cardup but incur a feehttps://carduphelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900006127203-How-do-car-loan-payments-work-on-CardUp,btohqsg
So chocolate for miles via cardup?,btohqsg
Any idea which date does hsbc giro process payment for DBS credit card?,btohqsg
On payment due date  around 4pm,btohqsg
Anyone can explain to me how exactly I can use this to buy stocks ?,btohqsg
Maybe best to let us know your based saving amt left bah,btohqsg
Check ur DBS invoice . Typically due date - 5-6 working days,btohqsg
sorry . For my case is DBS card giro deduction‚Ä¶ HSBC deducted 5 days before my invoice due date,btohqsg
Ok  maybe DBS CS provided a different answer to me,btohqsg
actually datapoint or just base on what dbs cso say?,btohqsg
Kinda strange as dbs has been taking money on due date itself for giro to HSBC ega.,btohqsg
My first deduction coming this month   I called DBS CS on Monday  and that‚Äôs the answer I got from them,btohqsg
CSO not always right and it is probably a safe answer to give  so that people will prepare the money in advance for deduction. Anyway based on the data points here and my own experience  it‚Äôs always on due date.,btohqsg
As Tax season started and many cards nerfed  will we see new Video@ChrisHMSG?,btohqsg
Only thing changed was Choco fin card to pay tax. The rest of the card strategy is more or less the same for income tax payment.,btohqsg
Just curious what platform accepts choc card for tax payment? Cardup does not accept choc card for now.,btohqsg
Thanks I‚Äôll have to explore this option as never use AXS before lol,btohqsg
use axs app/website  choose credit card - other bank   for chocolate card,btohqsg

Thanks all for pointing out this option! üôèAlso see that AXS can make rental payment at 1.7% admin fee which is slightly lower than cardup fee. Will try out using choc card for rental payment  to see if it works.,btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestions if I would like meet the minimum credit card spending on my card but doesn‚Äôt live in Singapore? Rn no expenses except telecom,btohqsg
SAD: Can I use the Chocolate Visa debit card on AXS?AXS is no longer accepting the Chocolate Debit Card as a credit card payment mechanism. We are exploring with them to see if we can resolve.Nothing else about the Max Miles programme is affected. You can still earn 2 Max Miles for every S$1 spent on almost any other spend  anywhere‚Äîup to your first S$1 000 spend per month and 0.4 Max Miles per S$1 after that. Plus  enjoy free FX on overseas spending.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt even tried paying anything on AXS ü§£,btohqsg
I haven't even figure out how to get my Virtual card details yet. And it's finished. üò¨,btohqsg

Lesson learnt - if encountered any issue  don‚Äôt call merchants/service providers straight away. If 2% of members in this group called them  that is about 400 calls bombard them every day. They will sure one day raise white flag.Imaging you receive 400 calls a day asking the same question  you will soon terminate the phone line n change phone number.üòÇThat is about receive one call every 1-2 minutes during office hour.,btohqsg
