U can try buy transfer miles from other but not cheap too haha,btohqsg
Top up is not worth it. U might as well pay full fare and save enough miles to redeem a subsequent flight,btohqsg
Just wondering if anyone on vivifi mobile? Can share your referral code??,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Just wondering if there's any card to substitute instarem amaze that converts unlimilted offline transactions to online transactions cos instarem amaze charges 1% after $1000 spend in a month,btohqsg
Good morning guys  could I ask do you guys hold an uob kris flyer account if you are the holder of the uob krisflyer credit card please to earn the extra krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
May I asked when pairing CRMC with Amaze  we based on which card cycle or calendar month?,btohqsg
Amaze is calender and crcm is statement,btohqsg
Another novice Qs. When travelling to JB  is it worth putting retail spend onto Amaze + CRMC? What do most do here?,btohqsg
does it matter when in the month i send the SMS to register for HSBC EGA bonus interest promo? (i.e. will it only start counting after sms sent?),btohqsg
Did u consider mixing miles and cash for your air tix or transfer to KrisPay ? I use this method for my expiring miles that I can't utilise for award ticket and class upgrade,btohqsg
Bumping up my own question again.. Anyone here can advise  please ? Appreciate 😊,btohqsg
But i have 150k of cash with ocbc and a house loan with it,btohqsg
Then ocbc will give you at least 4.65% of interest for $150k of saving with min $500 spending on card n salary credit provided you have $500 incremental of saving per month.,btohqsg
I hope they are able to waive off as they earn from me a lot in my house loan,btohqsg
Credit card department is different from others and they work independently,btohqsg
PSA: Those who did the buy $500 get $50 Capita voucher promo in May 2024  your $50 bonus vouchers are expiring these few days. Please go check. I noticed the vouchers are now no longer sorted by Date of Expiry.,btohqsg
Yes. So u can get points for forex using amaze and bonus points for crcm.,btohqsg
If they refuse to  can I cancel and not pay the charges?,btohqsg
They should be able to waive it. Believe it by faith first then do the needful.The system decides based on business rules which we dun know anything about. Better to call CSO and ask CSO to put up manual request. Inform the CSO that u r prepared to cancel the card if u r charged annual fees.,btohqsg
My recent list of high interest deposit:1 uob one 4% at 150k with salary and spend 5002 ocbc 360 4.6% at 100k with salary save and spend 5003 slashaway fixed deposit 3 month 3.65%4 hsbc ega 1% + 3.65%Above are all bank deposit accountInterestingly recent t bill failed to 3.4% ... not sure will keep dropping or not.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtmay I ask but for hsbc ega transfer 360k u can't do it in 1 day so there is always a part of the fund are not incremental / fresh funds anymore isn't so I thought only 200k below maybe can do it every month clean,btohqsg
do everything in advance. Start transferring out earlier.make sure you end up with minimum amount in your HSBC EGA when month end closes.,btohqsg

Hello  sorry for asking  what is the best mile card to pay for insurance/income tax via cardup? For entry level cards,btohqsg
Uob prvi visa or ocbc 90n,btohqsg

Yes I am considering this method as I don't have enough miles to redeem business ticket,btohqsg

Thanks! I assume the transfer mentioned is the amaze currency exchange ?,btohqsg
do the SGD10 spend one.. much much easier,btohqsg
Thanks! Means spend SGD10 from wallet i assume?,btohqsg
i never thought it is wise to use Amaze wallet  but up to you.i would use Amaze linked to a Credit Card that earns good rewards,btohqsg
My friend spent $1000 this month using amaze linked to citi rewards already. But status still awaiting for first transfer,btohqsg
is your friend $1000 transaction an excluded one?,btohqsg
What do you mean excluded one?,btohqsg
Thanks for the help so far! 🙏🏻 appreciated,btohqsg
Oh. Not in the exclusion list. She spent $1000 on furnitures,btohqsg
then should have met the requirements and both of you receive the referral Instapoints.,btohqsg
I guess i have to wait for a while first then! Since transaction was made on last saturday,btohqsg
if after 2-3 working days still cannot.. live chat with Amaze Team,btohqsg
what do you guys pay for ezlink $600?,btohqsg
