They collected for some weird reason,btohqsg
I thgt it was j my class but ok,btohqsg
The last qn was would building more roads help the Filipino economy,btohqsg
But no exchange rate so I'm pretty happy since I dont understand,btohqsg
Its the easiest of chapter 6 for me after mncs  considering i dont understand the whole chapter,btohqsg
But u need to write so much,btohqsg
So he used about 20 pages,btohqsg
Is it the 12 page or 16 page one,btohqsg
1st booklet is 12 the next is 4 pages,btohqsg
In prelims i used less than 10,btohqsg
Is it like the geog elect one?,btohqsg
But everyone said the paper was really easy,btohqsg
I dont know how to do any of these,btohqsg
But if i were to choose  2 and 5,btohqsg
I did 3 4 and 5,btohqsg
I forgot the definition so I skipped 2,btohqsg
Wait doesnt every question have definitions,btohqsg
Yea but the rest I sort of remember,btohqsg
Did ur school say it was easy?,btohqsg
My class i guess they did,btohqsg
My teacher said all the qns doable lmao,btohqsg
Afterall theres only 31 ppl who went for the exam,btohqsg
Ohh I tot A level paper,btohqsg
Anyone has answers for the paper,btohqsg
It was like a lot of application like those theory kind of exp don’t have,btohqsg
now going towards application based. testing u if u know how to apply concepts in a real world situation,btohqsg
so the future students should grasp the concept very well then can apply better,btohqsg
but first must recognize what area is the question asking. if fail to recognize totally  then marks will be lost,btohqsg
They collect because econs is using international version so they need to quarantine the papers,btohqsg
The UK would be taking the paper at a later time than us,btohqsg
But then they’re using a different version but it’s still similar,btohqsg
So they want minimise the leakage,btohqsg
But the last one I only wrote about 1 page plus,btohqsg
The moment I saw current account 8 mark question I was like imma skip this,btohqsg
Oh god i wldve gotten 0,btohqsg
I dont understand the entirety of chapter 6,btohqsg
Nvm anyway econs paper since it’s international it’s easy to get distinction,btohqsg
Then again i dont know what monopolies are,btohqsg
Not to be a bummer but i got F9 for prelims i must be realistic,btohqsg
Anyway I believe we got option Z,btohqsg
So taking into account the new syllabus I assume A2 is maybe 68%,btohqsg
But to be extra i found out the qns,btohqsg
That’s damn wasted econs I see it as a free distinction,btohqsg
Last year my sch got 84% distinction and the previous previous year 93%,btohqsg
Legit u should see Cambridge mark scheme it’s Soo lenient,btohqsg
But i cant generate any of those points,btohqsg
Ah yes way easier than sch,btohqsg
Just say “gov spending on education increase skills employment and wages”,btohqsg
It’s too lenient and that’s why I think my sch always have damn high dist rate lol,btohqsg
That’s why I honestly think the whole econs still has less to study than the entire elect geog syllabus itself even with common last topic for geog,btohqsg
