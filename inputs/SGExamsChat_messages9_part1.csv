If you're going to local uni that is not Yale NUS,btohqsg
if you have the time to study for it,btohqsg
i have a harvard mentor and was told SATs alone sometimes cant get you through,btohqsg
There's way too many SAT perfect scorers out there,btohqsg
tbh depends on what course you want to get into!,btohqsg
well portfolio says one thingbut whats more impressive is if you go out of your way to do ‚Äústuff‚Äù that speaks about your passion,btohqsg
for instance initiating a community proj w your local CC which reflects your love for social work or teaching coding onlinethe key word is initiatives!,btohqsg
If that's so then I think your ECG counsellors/teachers would be way better people to talk to than us,btohqsg
but what universities are usually looking out for is characterdont make yourself look ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù (only know how study for example)show them some color,btohqsg
and if your portfolio has all range of activities like sports  community srv  talks  etcyou probably risk yourself being judged as someone unsure of his passion or look like you just joining shit to boost your portfolio,btohqsg
i'm rly lost as to how to continue community service tho hahah my self initiated projects have been put on hold and most service centres stopped allowing students to come,btohqsg
depends on the indiv uni i think??,btohqsg
like maybe some unis place higher importance for SAT etc,btohqsg
beyond me LOL i from polyi didnt rlly enquire alot on JC side üòÇbut id say SATs cus everyone is judged based on this yardstickdont quote me on this üòÇ,btohqsg
You can show them that it's your passion in your personal statement,btohqsg
if u rlly passionate in smthit naturaly shows,btohqsg
That's portfolio still. Everything is portfolio.,btohqsg
Can always exclude things that aren't aligned  just like in a resume. Don't have to put everything. Just the ones most relevant.,btohqsg
I realised I'm only interested in med chem and org chem,btohqsg
