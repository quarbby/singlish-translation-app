Just liaise with your loaner after that then u liaise with the car company because this is a loan problem and they don't have direct access or any clause to interfere unless your loan company same as car dealer or recommend by them gg they will also drag,btohqsg
Now wife tell me to be more low key  be a good parent all this,btohqsg
Go test drive both back to back,btohqsg
Then maybe you can straight bank loan,btohqsg
Loan co. is in house of the car dealer so yeah,btohqsg

Your audi for normal series damn ex bruh just get a s5 or rs5 for 80ish to 95k left 7 to 7 years coe (renewed),btohqsg
Yea car time  so is in house one,btohqsg
But at this point  might as well I go for 218i gran coupe,btohqsg
After all  I only wanted the A5 for its frameless door and not being a COE car,btohqsg
And that all along I drove Audi,btohqsg
So change from one unreliable car to another,btohqsg
