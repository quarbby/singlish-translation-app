Hi guys  can I check how do I bid for auction vehicles ?,btohqsg
There is a form at sgcarmart… fill up and send to the seller:) get ready your money 💰,btohqsg
Only car dealers can bid for auction vehicles via Quotz - J,btohqsg
can it just be a private entity or car dealer only,btohqsg
Must be car dealer. Not sure whether they will open it up to the masses in the future. I got ask before - J,btohqsg
Cuz if they open up to everyone  there's the worry that there will be people who just bid for fun and raise the price of the car - J,btohqsg
if they bid  just make sure they buy,btohqsg
But there are dealers who are willing to bid for you,btohqsg
anyone has bid on Mercs auction?,btohqsg
Very easy to create another account  so no point,btohqsg
need to be 1 step ahead and plug all the loopholes then,btohqsg
cannot be few blacksheet cut off everything sia,btohqsg
Tiagong have to be full cash ah,btohqsg
i believe for some auctions you can get a license to bid but you need to pay for the registration,btohqsg
most of the mercedes financial services ones,btohqsg
i tried searching for vehicle listed in sgcm  couldnt find,btohqsg
would be nice if we cud buy a car full cash upfront..,btohqsg
can get loan. but bank approval needs to be fast,btohqsg
and idk man... choosing my own insurance company? instead of being limited by the dealer?,btohqsg
they don't have listings up all the time,btohqsg
you can if you have the cash?,btohqsg
the listings were up in sgcm which directed me there,btohqsg
yeah BY PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE,btohqsg
that one you must negotiate with the dealer,btohqsg
i go with my fren before to see car,btohqsg
they prefer using their own insurance and loan cause it gives them comms,btohqsg
but you need to see who the dealer is,btohqsg
try to secure own loan  they don't add in too much in terms of pricing,btohqsg
and pick one with low early settlement charges,btohqsg
Technically you’ll still be paying lesser than if you were to loan,btohqsg
if you really want that specific car,btohqsg
If bank  after 1 year don’t have,btohqsg
now i know. lesson learnt already sometimes,btohqsg
for bank loan if ownself source,btohqsg
u need to determine the loan amount urself?,btohqsg
or issit like based on ur income  the bank will loan u X amount,btohqsg
maximum then its up to u to play,btohqsg
