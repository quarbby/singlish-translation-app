Your life my dream  living room can put car,btohqsg
No ah I mean is it possible that I use sgcarmart to sell my car but after transfer car  the buyer ghosted me  possible?,btohqsg
direct seller usually procedure is to transfer money first then transfer ownership + handover  all done on the spot,btohqsg
You handcuff to each other. On the spot pay and trf ownership. No escape,btohqsg
Oh so if buyer chood pattern then have to be alert liao?,btohqsg
this is why u got sales agreement contract,btohqsg
the sales agreement is enforceable under the law,btohqsg
on the way one lah. Don’t do those funny you pay first  then I give you agreement  then after bring hamster to vet  then transfer you,btohqsg
usually all on laptop transfer  —> buyer makes payment to seller —> buyer accepts ownership trf on onemotoring,btohqsg
dont do stuff without a sales agreement,btohqsg
so if buyer or seller do funny stuff,btohqsg
if you want to really play safe  pay a dealership to escrow,btohqsg
court will give verdict based on sales agreement one,btohqsg
no wonder he got so many car,btohqsg
many deals fall throught then he end up keep the car,btohqsg
i got consignment dealer do it for me,btohqsg
and everything do on the spot,btohqsg
Wah then he takes 500 for that?,btohqsg
But I guess for the effort of test driving and entertaining calls etc,btohqsg
depends on how much he charge buyer,btohqsg
If you transfer ownership before getting any money in hand then erm....,btohqsg
Or you pay 30-40% then meet up and transfer ownership then transfer the rest on the spot,btohqsg
And you don't need to pay SGCM or any consignment dealer for this,btohqsg
Or ask a lawyer to draw up for a nominal fee,btohqsg
If going through consignment the process alwaysSign agreement  pay dp  transfer ownership  disburse loan or rest of the payment,btohqsg
considered cheap liao lor...honestly its a shady world with second hand car dealers. faster u transact and do the LTA transfer  the better.,btohqsg
if it were me i buy those JDM plaster sticker paste over it LOL,btohqsg
More economical until I damage it more,btohqsg
