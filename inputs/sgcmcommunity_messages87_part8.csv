Not a fan of the jupiter colour tho,btohqsg
Dis time rnd dealer lose money if guaranteed coe,btohqsg
So its not always dealer make money. Unless they decide not to honor contract / run road thats another story,btohqsg
Depends on the contract lo but during big inc usually 1 bid guarantee lose money(for dealer). 6bid den prolly they will delay abit,btohqsg
If say dealer put 1bid guarantee coe when coe was at 96k last mth den prolly wah lose 14k lo. Factor the car total price maybe arnd 4k loss.Coe -12k den +14k. They earn money last mth to tiap dis mth loss.,btohqsg
true true  but aiya dont worry their premium is 50-60k some 100k per car  4k is nothing to them,btohqsg
Nothing to you also cos u paid full price,btohqsg
