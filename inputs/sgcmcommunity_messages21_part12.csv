Euro and Jap cars are not competitors  but are you telling me you will choose a mazda 6 2.5 over a E300/530?,btohqsg
Valet is the best choice! Safe! Or can take taxi too! Always best to be safe,btohqsg
Valet so convenient after work just go happy,btohqsg
We're not saying they're superior Mr X  just saying they aren't as unreliable as you claim they are,btohqsg
i am not saying mazda 6 is lousy because it is VERY GOOD  but in its class.,btohqsg
what do you mean they cannot buy? cannot afford it?,btohqsg
Prices  segments  quality  dynamics  purpose. All very different for contis and Mazdas but all are pretty reliable these days,btohqsg
i met a few who own f10  and japanese cars. one of them just as recently as last month who drives a lexus to change tires and he told me japanese car is so easy to maintain and cheap. his f10 he cant drive it everyday because it breaksdown often and each time it is expensive to maintain.,btohqsg
so are you implying that mazda 6 has less tire wear compare to an F10?,btohqsg
i like subaru a lot but i donâ€™t go around saying subaru owners are ex mazda owners cos more nice looking calm down la bro haha,btohqsg
nobody i spoke to says euro cars is cheap to maintain. almost everyone i came across says japanese cars is a lot better. and coming from me who own both euro cars and japanese i can agree with that 100%,btohqsg
Cheap to maintain and reliable are two very different things sir,btohqsg
ur version of likely is ur friend who own f10 where got objective sia like this,btohqsg
we arent talking abt cheap... reliability,btohqsg
Of course japanese cars cheaper to maintain  more volume  more parts  cheaper cost. Reliability very different,btohqsg
can send me the seller info i wanna go buy now,btohqsg
Have a lot  not same price as cx8,btohqsg
you missed my point. i dont use emotion to say what is factual. although i like bmw for its driving dynamics and driving pleasure  i got to say it is less reliable and more expensive to maintain than japanese,btohqsg
u can fit a 180cm person at the back of a CX8. u can only fit dismembered body parts of a 180cm guy in the back of a GLB,btohqsg
Glb and bmw 2 GT a bit small compared to cx8,btohqsg
CX8 is not cheap and very good  but it is no way gonna rival an X5 or GLE,btohqsg
If your definition of better is cheaper  completely fine. But please don't go around saying only Mazda reliable and euro cars are not reliable because that is honestly not accurate at all,btohqsg
okay wait dont take it out of context. I am not saying CX8 is lousy cos i love it too  but my dear Mr X is comparing it to Euro cars like X5 and GLE,btohqsg
this is a fact. it is not just mazda. it is japanese cars in general - toyota honda nissan are all lkess expensive and easy to maintain than euro cars,btohqsg
from our pov u use emotion a lot actually  can ask the people in the chat,btohqsg
Aiya he meant  a direct conti competitor to cx8 that's 7 seater. Kodiaq fits  good shout! Others different class already,btohqsg
that  many can attest to it,btohqsg
how cani use emotions? i own many euro cars too.,btohqsg
reliability. Out of point. Max 10/40 for this essay. Irrelevant arguements,btohqsg
and i know people who own Mazdas  who say a silent prayer before they try to start the car.,btohqsg
I open another can of worm,btohqsg
Remember I said.Toyota Altis Top 1 car for retiree.Drive slow slow road hogging.Toyota car problems freeðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
you ask me i ask who? how many times here you talk badly about other cars just to prove mazda good haha right not ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
but.. i don't go out and make sweeping statements,btohqsg
vios is a tank that wonâ€™t stop running,btohqsg
^ ah yes sweeping statements is the key word,btohqsg
I own quite a few conti n Asian rides. those that give problems are always conti.Asian cars no problem at all. but I still love contiðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Have $$$  I also want contiâ€¦ but I got no $$$,btohqsg
family owned volvo for 20+ years  never broke down once  toyota wish first hand broke down quite a few times after 8 years,btohqsg
why are you so ensitive about euro cars being talked down? i also own euro cars. just accept the opininon from me. if you disagree  it is fine. but no need to say it is emotional. if i were emotional  i would not have owned bmws and alfas in the past,btohqsg
If you're comparing the reliability of an E30 to a modern Mazda 6 then I really clap for you sir! ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡,btohqsg
no la he comparing is blue E92 horðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
nice  i heard u say u rev at 5000rpm constantly,btohqsg
i have friends driving the e92 m3 and they have not seen a single tow truck for the past 3-4 years,btohqsg
so stop being so emotional. you like your euro cars fine. i also like my m3. but that is besides the point . great driving machine but many faults.,btohqsg
then we have subaru  go from one workshop to another,btohqsg
Ok compare e92 M3 to Mazda 6  I still clap for you,btohqsg
so you want to own a performance car which doesn't really measure anything,btohqsg
that is an outlier. but then again did you also hear of the many who have busted rod bearings?,btohqsg
then i can also ask why you so sensitive when people think you shouldnâ€™t make sweeping statements right haha,btohqsg
