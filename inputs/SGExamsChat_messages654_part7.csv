"i said in the discord that it was a bad decision to only put 3 schs none of which were safetiesthen the person who said ""so sad that you think 243 is a bad score"" was like ""but its possible that he didnt know that you should apply to schools that you hit the cop of"" and that he was a 12 yo kid so he didnt know better",btohqsg
i think his parents also a bit delusional,btohqsg
