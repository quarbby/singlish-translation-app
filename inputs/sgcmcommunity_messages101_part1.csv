Regular maintenance and replace parts before they give problem  averagely 3 days of down time in a year,btohqsg
Preventive maintenance is still repair leh,btohqsg
Just means you don't have unexpected breakdowns only,btohqsg
You are right. That said the mk7/mqb platform cars are much more refined and tend to have less trouble with their updated dsg. So far not like the mk5/6 pq35 platform. Wear still exist like clutch packs etc. But much better.,btohqsg
wa from the way he originally say  i tot totally no parts change,btohqsg
i thinking huh? golf no repair?,btohqsg
first one maybe but not the second,btohqsg
No  preventive maintenance is not repair  it is maintenance.,btohqsg
Both are replacing parts  only a matter of when they break down Vs before,btohqsg
But if you wanna humble brag that your car never broke down then whatever rocks your boat,btohqsg
