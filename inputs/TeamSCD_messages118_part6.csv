Actually the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way is coilovers la ahhahha for gap,btohqsg
Change tyre size etc is done v often but gives u other problems like loss of power  increased FC etc,btohqsg
if he change small shd be increase power hahaha,btohqsg
Change smaller diameter means increase revolutions leh,btohqsg
That means the car need work harder also,btohqsg
Ok come  but first drop $10k for me,btohqsg

i go my usual workshop better  duck rice nice  thai food also nice,btohqsg
i think put cupnoodles vending machine there sure good money,btohqsg
I have been thinking about getting lowering spring instead of coilovers,btohqsg
it will damage your suspension then end up spend more for coilovers,btohqsg
I wanna stay stock so badly üò≠,btohqsg
then set to the softest setting,btohqsg
My eibach prokit. Doesnt lower alot. Sportsline will lower more. In the process of destroying my stock absorbers den change bilstein b8. But yea actually costs shd be similAr to coilovers.. plus coilovers labour 1x good one.Coilovers are adjustable somemore ü•≤,btohqsg
that is a good question lol,btohqsg
So far all i know is quite hard compare to stock,btohqsg
i know you can choose the spring rate as well when buying,btohqsg
so can go with a softer spring,btohqsg
but i always hear different opinions when comes to coilovers,btohqsg
some say softer can corner faster on the streets  some say harder can go faster but not easy to control,btohqsg
