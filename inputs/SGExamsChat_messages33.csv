Didn't do enough papers to comment on this,btohqsg
did both papers  get 60s for hc paper and 70s for ny ppr,btohqsg
hc papers in the past was killer,btohqsg
Add 15 to get expected a level grade,btohqsg
they like setting a lot of 'application qns',btohqsg
prelim chem papers overall 80% is very doable,btohqsg
they bring in things like ethers,btohqsg
I rmb trigo was the hardest topic,btohqsg
'in reality  this synthesis can only be possible with bla bla bla',btohqsg
the only paper that fked me over was VJC 2018,btohqsg
then hit u with smtg u nvr see b4,btohqsg
braindead to do but so much working,btohqsg
Basically just spam papers from mid to high tier jc?,btohqsg
u need worry abt that meh,btohqsg
I should have time for that,btohqsg
lmao fk u just reminded me of how i forgot all abt linear algebra,btohqsg
For me  staying awake in lecture was the hardest,btohqsg
If u have time try every jc,btohqsg
i would say do a mix of prelim papers within ur JC range,btohqsg
dont need aim for top papers  no use one,btohqsg
Trust me my schools papers are nothing compared to the others,btohqsg
if it was so effective  my sch chem dist rate wont be 17%,btohqsg
My jc produces less than 5 90rps a year,btohqsg
Nope but they give free summary notes,btohqsg
All non free tuitions are not good,btohqsg
Try to finish each paper 30 minutes before the time limit,btohqsg
I need to reach a higher standard,btohqsg
and i guarantee that the notes can math twig's,btohqsg
Cause i need at least 87.5rp,btohqsg
Are u the ex-RI HOD for chem,btohqsg
Ah  econs is a totally different story,btohqsg
I can try to finish my econs paper 30 mins after,btohqsg
im pretty sure all centres out there  their 'condensed' notes is total bull,btohqsg
hmm i think is comparable to this,btohqsg
aside from that i have two chem books,btohqsg
My amath cher last time finished his paper an hour early,btohqsg
i rmb h2 chem p2 i only took 1hr15mins,btohqsg
but still fked it big time,btohqsg
This is the real good shit,btohqsg
I finished both H2 math papers in about 2 hours,btohqsg
So for math it's very doable,btohqsg
I mean some parts of it,btohqsg
Econs impossible; don't even bother finishing before time limit,btohqsg
there's a reason why notes are sold as assessment books in popular,btohqsg
Like u dont rly learn some stuff for As,btohqsg
my sec sch classmate from HC lost her A at a lvls for chem,btohqsg
same  but im getting rusty recently cos its been a long time since i read content,btohqsg
Lol o level o chem go home la,btohqsg
Why do i hear boss music,btohqsg
True ah  but some schs put pure chem qns in comb chem exams,btohqsg
then some schs put h3 chem qns in h2 chem,btohqsg
U have yet to try my evil paper :D,btohqsg
My cells just mutated seeing this,btohqsg
then dhs likes putting reactions like synthesis of benzoic acid from benzene,btohqsg
hi!! sorry to interrupt the discussion but does anyone know when NUS will contact shortlisted candidates for PPE interview ;-;;;,btohqsg
Special relativity is a fun subject,btohqsg
This does not look fun at all,btohqsg
Tbh with COVID19 really hard to tell,btohqsg
If u move sufficiently fast enough u can fit into any space,btohqsg
do you have any idea when our seniors got offered interviews though?,btohqsg
The really desirable ones get letters within 1-2 weeks,btohqsg
Been 2 weeks and i no reply :(,btohqsg
@Jayjay253u assume u are desirable SMH,btohqsg
Wait what oh no my bio getting rusty,btohqsg
I swear on my bio grade its caused by mutation,btohqsg
My sch at least 75% get 4 As,btohqsg
Point mutation in form of base pair sub.,btohqsg
And i can still rmb most of my jc stuff,btohqsg
If for the atas course ya la,btohqsg
what are the theoretical properties of helium hydride,btohqsg
Unless your course has interview round,btohqsg
The best is yet to come,btohqsg
but tbh i might know soon,btohqsg
zai i gave everything back to my chers,btohqsg
cos im almost done with inorganic chem,btohqsg
I swear chem just gets more cancerous,btohqsg
HAHA it does makes sense tho,btohqsg
legit tho you give me any a level phys/chem/math i cmi,btohqsg
thank god i dont have to take chinese,btohqsg
i'd like to thank the chinese song spotify playlist,btohqsg
I legit binged mandopop the day before a level written papers,btohqsg
ive never heard this method b4,btohqsg
WA MEN TI  WA MEN TI,btohqsg
Last ditch hope to memorise chim phrases,btohqsg
I WATCH IT  AS A CHILD,btohqsg
Someone wore the UA uniform to sch last week,btohqsg
I watched that when I was in pri sch lmao,btohqsg
Watched it with my grandma all the time,btohqsg
That one long time ago alr,btohqsg
Ya but all boring af   can never replace 爱 + 夜市人生,btohqsg
All that tea in tw drama tho,btohqsg
My current fav hk drama is the one with the tear gas and police brutality,btohqsg
I HATE 夜市人生  invested so much of my life in it  the ending is just shoddily narrated by Youzhi.,btohqsg
best if  you watch frm the start like the kids grow into adults,btohqsg
this is the reason why it's so draggy like,btohqsg
Then they get removed one by one,btohqsg
It takes 300 draggy episodes for them to grow into adults,btohqsg
I will only watch hk dub tho,btohqsg
The tvb version is the best,btohqsg
The hk version > china version,btohqsg
one of the few exceptional ones,btohqsg
The script legit is very good,btohqsg
I like the sg history trilogy too,btohqsg
Not now now but now as in this period,btohqsg
I like the first one oni,btohqsg
Old ppl time in the chat woop,btohqsg
Like that bastard that killed his brother,btohqsg
I HATE THAT GEN 1 THAT IS STILL NARRATIVELY ALIVE IN S3 JUST DISAPPEARED. NEVER CAMEO  NEVER DIE.,btohqsg
well u need to rmb that sg scriptwriters only have 20 episodes to flaunt their talents,btohqsg
Then they should have written out the remaining Gen 1 out of the narrative by S2  they chose not to.,btohqsg
I like the movies long long time ago,btohqsg
The actress hugged my doggo once,btohqsg
Lol I never meet there actors before sia,btohqsg
Stay in SG so long le,btohqsg
How people run into them at grocery stores is beyond me,btohqsg
She friend of my aunt das why,btohqsg
Ur Aunt got some zai network,btohqsg
Bc less crowd = slower rate pf transmission,btohqsg
aileen tan is the only one i know abt lolol maybe they just close becos of sth else,btohqsg
Except the crowds gather outside the mall,btohqsg
Bc if you infect people you infect less thanif it were crowded,btohqsg
That’s the flaw with the plan,btohqsg
I wanna stay home and mug,btohqsg
"""Haha kids will go out and play all day anyway""",btohqsg
And expect kids to stay home?,btohqsg
Anyone agree with the no sick no mask policy,btohqsg
Likely there will be ppl going out,btohqsg
I don’t usually agree with our Govt but this I agree,btohqsg
But that is incomparable to forcing every one of them to go out every day,btohqsg
Its mainly to ensure sg has enough mask for medical professionals,btohqsg
Honestly even if I don't I also need to agree Cox I not enough masks HAHA,btohqsg
So basically is just resource allocation la,btohqsg
Also if they want go out and heck care studies i say let the bell curve be carried forth,btohqsg
But I heard got this new mask where u can reuse it,btohqsg
If we can print mask like nobody,btohqsg
Then I think gov won't care,btohqsg
like u just cut your mask into 6 pieces,btohqsg
Pull down that bellcurve for me baby,btohqsg
Anyway cambridge is marking leniently this year,btohqsg
And then u slot it in some mask that has a air hole thing in between I can't rmb but straits times got report,btohqsg
Erm if they get yeeted out of the game of life  they don’t exist on the curve,btohqsg
Mark lenient means everyone higher mark,btohqsg
Means u same grade as if they don't lenient,btohqsg
Ugh I hate this misconception that young ppl are safe,btohqsg
I need to ace the interview,btohqsg
U know the qn b4hand meh,btohqsg
Which i might considering I have the passion for med,btohqsg
It is equally logical that they don’t mark any more or less strictly,btohqsg
If u good enough u can spin any question into a favourable one,btohqsg
That sounds like dodging the question to me,btohqsg
So how u prep interview qn,btohqsg
It just means u good at improv,btohqsg
People ask you one thing and you answer a totally separate thing,btohqsg
But they do check for your genuine passion for med,btohqsg
Listening and Comprehension is also a skill looked out for in interview,btohqsg
"prolly sth like ""what are your views on carrying out abortions""",btohqsg
So I have an intrinsic motivation for medicine that most might not have,btohqsg
Just do wat you’re paid to do,btohqsg
yes they can use that to ascertain your moral compass,btohqsg
There are vids on med school interviews,btohqsg
I think they can ask about informed consent,btohqsg
Abortion differs from state to state,btohqsg
Hard questions are the ones worth answering,btohqsg
a trigger question is very good at weeding out undesirables,btohqsg
they just want to see how u answer it,btohqsg
Then make judgement as to when the fetus is considered a life,btohqsg
Speaking of interviews what was your Cambridge interview like?,btohqsg
No probe about why cam why major,btohqsg
You mean they give you a problem and you try to solve it?,btohqsg
Personally i would regard it as would the fetus have a good quality of life,btohqsg
There's a separate entrance exam tho,btohqsg
Maybe they looking at how efficient your work is under pressure,btohqsg
I’d look at the long-term consequences for my patient in general,btohqsg
How is it compared to step,btohqsg
if u have to choose to save the fetus or the mother what would u choose,btohqsg
Step is pure math and proving I believe,btohqsg
I never do step b4 I dunno,btohqsg
1 minute per qn de very rushed,btohqsg
THIS YEAR NUS ORIENTATION IS E-ORIENTATION,btohqsg
Means basically we weight adult decision more than baby decisions,btohqsg
Who has better chances of survival,btohqsg
jay backflashing to when he gave birth,btohqsg
Actually just list the different ideologies,btohqsg
No need have ur own view,btohqsg
What if the question is legit just asking what u would choose and why,btohqsg
Then this one cannot sit on fence,btohqsg
Maybe then list out ur assumption,btohqsg
following one NUS person on insta,btohqsg
she go and insta story the email from NUS,btohqsg
Assuming the mother has lower chances of survival due to blood loss  I would save the fetus,btohqsg
Say I assume that mother decision is more important and that baby cannot choose his life status,btohqsg
Hence given the circumstances I would choose xxx,btohqsg
Ya la just list out assumption,btohqsg
Assuming the baby would not likely survive even if we tried to save it  then i’d save the mother,btohqsg
Well that’s an easy way out,btohqsg
No shit if the baby doesn’t survive you wouldn’t try to save it,btohqsg
Psychologically the mother would probably want the child to survive,btohqsg
I think use gp format ba,btohqsg
The mother was going to abort,btohqsg
Eh I think if u want give some zai answer,btohqsg
U ask for a minute to think,btohqsg
Haha we’d so tear it down if this was a debate,btohqsg
"""Can you repeat the question?"" Buys u 6 seconds",btohqsg
However  considering surrogate mothers may form bonds with the fetus  women naturally feel attracted to the fetus,btohqsg
U can say here's how I understand it..xxx. am I correct?,btohqsg
So my assumption is the mother wants the fetus to live,btohqsg
Psychologically  the child might suffer without a Mother,btohqsg
What if there is a father there but he pass out due to too much emotion,btohqsg
Eh guys give overall strategy la,btohqsg
Don't grill him on specific liao,btohqsg
Now i feel like getting into law XD,btohqsg
The father would also want the child to live,btohqsg
Ok what if this fetus is a 3rd child.,btohqsg
Oi don't grill him with what ifs le,btohqsg
Generally fathers have less emotional connection with the baby,btohqsg
If the father is there but unconscious then it’s the same as if he wasn’t there,btohqsg
The parents would still feel guilt which would leave them with long-term psychological issues so they may end up incapable of caring for their other children,btohqsg
you'd have to take into account how he would feel if u decided on either his wife or baby,btohqsg
I’m actually amazed at your resp,btohqsg
I think some research say that,btohqsg
So if he wasn’t physically there  you wouldn’t take that into account?,btohqsg
More likely than not will divorce,btohqsg
I watch a lot of medical docs and shows,btohqsg
Sorta a hint for the interviewee,btohqsg
So i tend to think about these cases as a whole,btohqsg
Actually bro don't do stream of consciousness of what ifs,btohqsg
Means the mother might be unwed,btohqsg
So she may not even want the fetus,btohqsg
U lay out ur factors  ur assumption  make a decision  state exception  rebut exceptions,btohqsg
dis is basically the train problem but more emotional,btohqsg
Still  she will have attraction to the fetus,btohqsg
You realise that from ‘father not there’ you inferred ‘mom doesn’t want baby’,btohqsg
Sia la u guys too embroiled in this argument liao,btohqsg
Be objective and talk about strategy,btohqsg
We can search records on the mother to make sure,btohqsg
Eh actually u forget about time factor sia,btohqsg
But if time was of the essence  I would still save the child due to the psychological effects losing the child would have on the mother,btohqsg
Now u have 5 min buffer,btohqsg
What info u gather to decide,btohqsg
So you are making the assertion that the psychological effects would be worse than death,btohqsg
They would lead to death ultimately,btohqsg
alright im ready to be an annoying interviewer in the future,btohqsg
U watch too much drama le,btohqsg
How would you derive whether Mother emotionally want/don’t want the child  with objective emotionless facts in a record. Even if you have time.,btohqsg
When u born a female in the simulator,btohqsg
Eh chill. Overall strat is still the same,btohqsg
No need so many what ifs,btohqsg
China used to have the mentality that girls bad boys god,btohqsg
As they can farm and stuff,btohqsg
She may have verbally stated she wanted to be saved in this situation,btohqsg
Now girls have the upper hand,btohqsg
My parents didnt rly care much abt my studies,btohqsg
They don’t call it medlaw for no reason,btohqsg
Should it be illegal to perform surgery on a grape,btohqsg
Medical law is complex bc human lives are at risk,btohqsg
They don't let u anyhow use ur own value system to judge,btohqsg
A grape is a non-living thing at the stage of consumption,btohqsg
Hence as a plant it is not viable,btohqsg
I said that as a jest,btohqsg
Lol as you can see i am very into medical ethics,btohqsg
Its a big component in medicine,btohqsg
Just that don't hold so much assumptions,btohqsg
U assume this and that other ppl might now agree ma,btohqsg
I’m sure there’s an SOP to follow for vast majority of situations,btohqsg
As long as you follow general guidelines,btohqsg
Better just state factors and assumption but don't say ur assumption is always correct,btohqsg
Singapore Med field too small everybody know everybody,btohqsg
Malpractice oso cover each other backside,btohqsg
Say  given that xxx is true I would do yyy,btohqsg
But not since xxx so yyy,btohqsg
Tbh the interview part is a piece of cake,btohqsg
No but I know of people who have been trying to find justice but to no avail,btohqsg
I’m just worried about my rp,btohqsg
But malpractice can kill the doctor career sia,btohqsg
Only medical drama I watch is MD house,btohqsg
Chicago med is a good one,btohqsg
Chicago fire and chicago pd are related series that are equally nice if you’re into that,btohqsg
I like the issues it provokes us to ponder,btohqsg
i personally believe that covid isnt a laughing matter,btohqsg
my class has placed a soft ban on all covid related pranks for tomorrow,btohqsg
Joke about covid then death is the punchline,btohqsg
Personally  I have a feeling my sergeants are gonna troll us tomorrow,btohqsg
the thing is the ban came about cause that's precisely the kind of humour we have,btohqsg
and that shit can cause panic,btohqsg
Eh I just heard y'all coming home,btohqsg
my friend just sent me that pdf im-,btohqsg
That moment when i hear all my hta friends cheering about bookout in my chat group,btohqsg
"and I was like ""sis this ain't funny""",btohqsg
time to shave my head lol,btohqsg
a classmate sent that shit to my class group sia,btohqsg
the one with my tutors lmao,btohqsg
but honestly tho i was scared for a moment when it was sent here,btohqsg
"I was like ""how could you  govt—""",btohqsg
The rare student who doesn’t want lockdown,btohqsg
Some people really do study at home better,btohqsg
I'll end up taking naps all day at home LMAO,btohqsg
But some need to go to school because they are auditory learners,btohqsg
Just like my friend  who is never seen in school on Fridays,btohqsg
Theres also the factor of self discipline ;),btohqsg
yep coz home is too comfortable for me. But like I can still adapt,btohqsg
But i love staying at home,btohqsg
Especially when school is on the other side of sg,btohqsg
Not bcoz of corona but bcoz idw to end up spending money outside of hse,btohqsg
I live vv near the sch,btohqsg
fuck me i need to make a meme but i dont have any ideas,btohqsg
I was supposed to go to a school within walking distance,btohqsg
But bellcurve god decided to change plans,btohqsg
I can study at home  in sch  outside library  even a noisy cafe...I'm rather flexible,btohqsg
But bus a lil shaky tho,btohqsg
The best public transport to study on is dt line train tbh,btohqsg
I’m damn productive taking dt line,btohqsg
Ya so I won't write anything I'll just read my notes and then maybe memorise lorh,btohqsg
Esp when i see elite sch ppl,btohqsg
Ya I agree. EWL is just...crowded,btohqsg
But at least I can snack while on e learning and on thurs (don't ask me why it's just tj) when I've HBL I'm just gonna blatantly snack in front of the tchr,btohqsg
Lol if e learning can sleep a bit more too,btohqsg
Bc just wake up then take attendence,btohqsg
Ya I can just wake up 30 mins b4 the first lessons and just comb my hair wash my face and voila,btohqsg
I ate lunch during live streaming,btohqsg
I don’t even bother with that,btohqsg
If i on my camera and i look like shit so be it lmao,btohqsg
I would be so self conscious HAHAHA,btohqsg
It would be nice if some things stayed this way after the covid blows over,btohqsg
You can learn at your own pace,btohqsg
home based lectures are ok for me but tutorials hmmm,btohqsg
And go home early for self-revision,btohqsg
The best would be to start school at nine-ish and end tutorials around 1-2pm,btohqsg
3 days of school to be home based  2 days of tutorial @ school,btohqsg
OKAY this is a good idea,btohqsg
It's is damn ideal for me SOMEHOW HAHA,btohqsg
My school had that for 2 weeks,btohqsg
More HBL also means each student takes up less space in the school,btohqsg
Just in time for covid baby boom,btohqsg
kms no pls that's so silly,btohqsg
In the future webcams will be able to take your temperature,btohqsg
Speaking of temp taking my school has the funniest announcement at 1215 for mid day temp taking,btohqsg
Its so scripted the cher even laughed when she recorded it,btohqsg
These Pepes are too well coloured,btohqsg
1030 missed messages wow yall good,btohqsg
sorry im not sure what im supposed to see there,btohqsg
HAHA BRO ALR GOT SOME JOKER SEND LIAO,btohqsg

How long to stay in sunlight for dark skin people to synthesize sufficient vitamin D for the day? Vitamin D is also essential for immunity boost.,btohqsg
Then most prob won't go to dust,btohqsg
Eh u mean gov retracting offer?,btohqsg
I interview with those private firms,btohqsg
They don't really have formalized process,btohqsg
Either tell them u still interviewing,btohqsg
Plus I interviewing with private firms,btohqsg
They don't have everything set in stone,btohqsg
If u good u will have multiple offers,btohqsg
That's the whole point of leveraging offers,btohqsg
Eh I can't advise u one that,btohqsg
But I got 2 offers plus interviewing for 3 more,btohqsg
Interviewing not counted as many ba,btohqsg
I used to juggle 100 plus interviews in 3 months,btohqsg
Ya la job hard to find right,btohqsg
Actually sacrifice a lot in terms of studying,btohqsg
Didn't do very well but still passable,btohqsg
Can afford to fuck up a little,btohqsg
Eh I meant last year I fuck up,btohqsg
Is ok la I not particularly clear also,btohqsg
As in full time grad job gone,btohqsg

Second year will determine grad job le in UK,btohqsg
Nus u got 1 year to lepak and fuck around,btohqsg
