Or is he some famous COC YouTuber,btohqsg
im writing a science based essay but im making a claim that sg has a very stressful education system and a large number of students are stress,btohqsg
but like i have no source for that statement,btohqsg
How tf do i write this,btohqsg
Do i just throw my essay out the window and redo,btohqsg
time to make a survey and collate from the general public,btohqsg
Bro there's no stats available on percentage of student in sg and how stressed they are by education system,btohqsg
its due tmr i wish i got that luxury,btohqsg
student suicide rates does kinda count?,btohqsg
u can link it to stress ig,btohqsg
Stress lvl and students age 6-18,btohqsg
Honestly bro they will say its other shit like depression then i kena fked by sch,btohqsg
im not sure wat other metric can be used to measure stress lvl,btohqsg
i cannot use correlation must use causation ._.,btohqsg
Im pretty sure that stat also don't exist,btohqsg
me not psychologist anyways  just rando on internet,btohqsg
i think moe does do like surveys,btohqsg
Brain fried bro i writing until near the end then realized,btohqsg
"i was like ""wait dont i need research stats to make that claim""",btohqsg
there is a research paper online about it but idk whether is linked to ur essay,btohqsg
i oso think of the concept before example/evidence lol,btohqsg
On how many ppl pass and move on to where,btohqsg
And how many ppl did well,btohqsg
"nah i have like ""do you have people to reach out to""  word for word ""how stressed are you"" i think",btohqsg
Cannot be used to make a claim ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
wait so what exactly do you need,btohqsg
Ohh this i saw but not my age grp,btohqsg
A large number of students aged 6-18 are stressed,btohqsg
""" it iz what it iz""",btohqsg
"""approximate percentage of students aged 6-18 in singapore who are stressed by the education system"" i just put this in my search bar",btohqsg
fk lah ill js pretend stress doesn't exist,btohqsg
Best part this essay is on children health and obesity,btohqsg
Yes stress not a big part yes,btohqsg
I have a whole 6 marks to lose,btohqsg
if they want be anal and penalised me for inaccuracy,btohqsg
but if is nt related then,btohqsg
Yeah going remove and pretend stress not a major factor in children health,btohqsg
I alr getting fked in my opening line for the essay,btohqsg
Nah is orchard gateway and is old pic,btohqsg
They will argue anxiety and stress different,btohqsg
and there are studies that show anxiety and stress are linked,btohqsg
Im doing psychology bro u must be accurate,btohqsg
there's this entire document you can comb through too,btohqsg
Correlation no causation is what they say ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
you can find evidence of both in studies,btohqsg
have those lecturers never done research before lol,btohqsg
Thing is u can over assume ah,btohqsg
so if i want use the essay will drag on,btohqsg
everything must be researched/science and evidence based,btohqsg
how tf uw me explain brain neurochemical mechanism 6 diff times and be under 1.5k word limit,btohqsg
u see right i got 6 pts,btohqsg
a buttload of psychology research is based on surveys and tests that can easily be argued against,btohqsg
but that's why people do a ton of them,btohqsg
and we must explain chemical  neurological or some mechanisms,btohqsg
we don't even understand half the stuff about our brain LOL,btohqsg
no bruh this is not paper writing,btohqsg
and i need everything to be as up to date as possible,btohqsg
you know what's a stereotype of the arts vs sciences in research papers,btohqsg
O ya the research article i can use must be from 2013 onwards,btohqsg
for science: the abstract you understand but you spent hours understanding one equation in the actual thing,btohqsg
If not i get slapped with outdated or possibly inaccurate info,btohqsg
for arts: the abstract says nothing but the entire paper just goes in circles,btohqsg
im gonna fail my module at this rate,btohqsg
Combined they form 60% of my grade for the mod,btohqsg
Thank god the other 40% i basically got all 40% LOL,btohqsg
the fact you're in psychology but they expect you to conduct research as tho you're doing neurobiology,btohqsg
Must conduct research on social mechanism,btohqsg
conduct research on social mechanism in a physical science way,btohqsg
basically we must like explain smt like stress and like sci behind it,btohqsg
let's put the sg students' under a brain scan as they study,btohqsg
Im in fking health management and promotion,btohqsg
thing is if you look at the sources cited by HPB,btohqsg
it's usually stuff like OECD anyway,btohqsg
I cited the ministry of health in my opening para,btohqsg
any rp ppl here dm me pls ty,btohqsg
We need form a alliance against this shit,btohqsg
ok but yea there's a lot of actual legit research on the biological link between stress and anxiety,btohqsg
but you don't have the word count for it lol,btohqsg
Got some lecturers right they kena filed complaints against,btohqsg
"sch response is ""can't fire cause they quite senior in sch""",btohqsg
but sch basically got 2 factions now,btohqsg
its in middle of a massive overhaul,btohqsg
If uw join do it after everything settles down,btohqsg
yk my loa took OSG 3 weeks to process,btohqsg
i mean ntu physics has one prof that was complained against so much that his section was removed from a mod,btohqsg
because the guy in charge of osg for LOA is on mc for 2 weeks,btohqsg
So no loa can be processed,btohqsg
And they put sch related shit on a single guy,btohqsg
eh dang my word docs suddenly become american,btohqsg
Usually it makes me includes u,btohqsg

"Qm ChargesOn 1 November 2023  Tay was charged in the State Courts of Singapore for allegedly distributing an intimate photo and video of a woman performing a sex act without the woman's consent  sending them to users in Telegram and in two chat groups.[7][8] He returned to court on 16 November to face the charges.[9]On 11 December  it was announced that Tay would be facing more charges. However  as the prosecution was not ready  the case was adjourned for four weeks to January 2024. Tay also hired a lawyer  Rohit Kumar Singh from Regal Law.[1] On 10 January  his additional charges were read out. This included a harassment-related charge for Tay purportedly asking for help with hiring a killer and saying he wanted someone to die ""ASAP""  also using vulgarities in his message.[8]On multiple occasions  Tay was heckled when he emerged from the State Courts' front doors.[10][1][9] Through his lawyer  Tay mentioned that the harassing and heckling had caused grief to his family  and he would be making police reports.[8]Cases of harassment against TayKurt Tay had been a victim of harassment by the members of the public on multiple occasions.In 2015 and early 2016  a group of three men  Singaporeans Aaron James Ang Jian Hian  Royston Chua Wei Kwang  and Malaysian Patrick Chong distributed flyers containing nude photos of Tay at Tay's HDB block in Yishun as well as Northpoint City where Tay worked. Ang and Chua were later charged and sentenced to six months and five months' imprisonment respectively.[11][12]In 2019  a person impersonating a Mediacorp staff invited Tay for an interview  as well as to film an episode of a comedy series  at the Mediacorp TV station. However when Tay showed up at the TV station  he was denied entry. Tay filed a police report.[13]Personal lifeIn 2013  Tay married Kim Ngan  a mail-order bride from Vietnam. They had a son in 2018 and a daughter in 2021.[14]",btohqsg
