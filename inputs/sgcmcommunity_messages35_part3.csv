Didn‚Äôt know leh  when I bought the car it came with a name card decal sticker onto the windscreen.Was kinda in a rush so I decided to give them a shot and they told me they could come down in 20 minutes and charged us around $100Then after they came down to remove tyre  they say it‚Äôll cost $175. Pulled a tourador tyre. Since here alr I might as well so just agreed LOL,btohqsg
