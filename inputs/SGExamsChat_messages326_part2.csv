yah sia i realised the job prospects are quite similar,btohqsg
i think polsci a bit more employable tho esp in govt policy  embassy work  or like other civil service jobs,btohqsg
References and citation is necessary too. I guess so like the standards of a good argumentative and insightful essay. depending on the word count,btohqsg
and they can still take on history maj post-grad roles,btohqsg
I find history more suitable to my calling,btohqsg
ahh so its like an idiosyncratic assessment ah like a personal pref,btohqsg
even tho i do read up on political science things outside the curriculum. Planning to take political science modules as minor,btohqsg
i have nooo idea how uni essays works buct,btohqsg
its those really detailed stuff innit,btohqsg
basically we just find other essays online  translate to 2 diff languages  then translate it back to english and use it as our own :D,btohqsg
i can show a example of my recent essay i got A- for as a sample,btohqsg
yes wayyy HAHAAH copying without being flagged for plagiarism,btohqsg
should do that for my future essays,btohqsg
translate an english essay into chinese,btohqsg
oh we try to pick languages w a similar grammatical structure as EL so the grammatical cleanup afterwards is less tedious,btohqsg
like el > spanish > german > el,btohqsg
yeah you can take a look,btohqsg
this is my mid term essay for hh1004: science and tech in a historical perspective,btohqsg
and thats 50% of ur entire gpa?!,btohqsg
not 50% cos is mid term,btohqsg
not entire GPA is percentage for the grade of the module - 3Aus,btohqsg
I am taking the ICC modules and my UEs + another history module concurrently,btohqsg
yeah you dun just take one module XD This was me last year,btohqsg
so there is prescribed amount of AUs you need to clear in order to grad,btohqsg
then that amount is split btw ICCs + FCs  BDES/UEs( outside major)   MPE( major prescribed electives  modules non-core but still under history) and core modules,btohqsg
ooh u wanna do lit ah,btohqsg
idk what the heck is up with CHS,btohqsg
i wan do polsci... then i need do actual life sci mods wtf ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i was under the impression that chs,btohqsg
has alot of weird stuff sooo,btohqsg
AHAHA i guess thereâ€™s this nasty side of NUS,btohqsg
but i think it can be compensated with our robust and fully exploitable SU system to inflate our grades,btohqsg
and a more stable module registration system too,btohqsg
lol reminds me of NTU S/U policy and Star Wars XD,btohqsg
Star Wars is not a pleasant one  some ppl dun even get their core modules then,btohqsg
OH AND NUS pays for our overseas uni sch fees for student exchange programmes,btohqsg
NTU yâ€™all gotta ownself pay the overseas uni as an international student i think(?),btohqsg
I am not too sure about that cos i dun plan to go overseas for exchange,btohqsg
and can apply for sponsorship for NUS too,btohqsg
either that or apply sponsorship from the partner university  which was what I did,btohqsg
that was long time ago. Not living allowance  one off payout,btohqsg
My student exchange was in Germany.German MOE side gave 5k which paid for the air ticket and student insurance with some spare  and then the partner university side sponsored my lodging.,btohqsg
wait how did u do it,btohqsg
like u email the partner uni?,btohqsg
was in the language preparation programme of NUS,btohqsg
so I took German from first semester  for 4 semesters. On the 4th semester  halfway through  they will invite applications  and once short-listed  there was an interview in German by the German lecturers,btohqsg
The German lady at the centre of the main picture was my German lecture lol,btohqsg
or get a pt job...i have lobang for one  4k a month  work remotely. interested parties can pm me  muz be above 21.and its a legit job  not use carousell scam ppl or be a sugarbaby  lazy ppl need not pm me,btohqsg
this is why we cant have good things.it is a legit role in an insurer  doing social media stuff (managing website  social media accounts  content-writing). it is sth rly suitable for students.  otot as long as u finish by dateline  no one cares u do at 2pm or 2am. work remotely.but it is ppl like u who wanna play police ...,btohqsg
wait insurer? then why do you need to know whether i give good blowjobs?,btohqsg
