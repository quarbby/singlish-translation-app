I am going to apply to MI. I heard that MI is only $6/month and has higher chance of going local uni. You also have 3 years to think about questions at a scenic pace and the cost in MI is less than in university because the MOE tuition subsidy only supports 4 years. If you prefer to extend to optimise results it is therefore less costly to do so in MI. You could also do this in JC if you retained or failed GP at the A level (and hence repeated J2).,btohqsg
idk y 1 of the hcl look down on me cus my chinese lol,btohqsg
huh  for me my parents don't even wan me go work they wan me study all the way until I cannot study anymore,btohqsg
i mean fr if you ever need physics help just lmk,btohqsg
That's fucking dumb imma be real,btohqsg
i talk to the guy oni give me 1 word ans unless absolutely needed,btohqsg
maybe he js dw talk to you,btohqsg
some ppl js dw talk to others so like js say the absolute necessary,btohqsg
or maybe cus he mainly speaks chinese eng not as gud,btohqsg
ik its not v nice but been there done that,btohqsg
at least I'm good at both,btohqsg
i tutor bc i like it and getting paid more means more pressure,btohqsg
I'm winning in life with si Yan as my phy tutor and yt daddy as my chem tutor HAHA,btohqsg
he does talk to other ppl tho,btohqsg
also means dealing with parents more,btohqsg
idk maybe he doesnt like you because of other reasons,btohqsg
it's not that bad? But it makes me nauseous for some reason,btohqsg
unless its sch work he wont rly ans me lol,btohqsg
still ok la first glance is bad,btohqsg
u can partial cert alos rite,btohqsg
i mean u can survive a lvls den uni year 1 is ok,btohqsg
Its prob just me but all these tutor self-promo is kinda making me even more motivated to ace my subj without y'all üòé,btohqsg
me: go for ityt: i need my money,btohqsg
i feel im doing it coz i just cant stand retail,btohqsg

until the kid finds out about the horrors of man,btohqsg
What if bunkmates doing the deed,btohqsg
i think it's more of i like to see students appreciate what physics is,btohqsg
to me is more like what can i stop this dude from making the same mistake again,btohqsg
not just formulae and shit you write for an exam,btohqsg
because year in year out people make the same shitty mistake,btohqsg
bc that's what it felt like to me for a long time,btohqsg
shit now can yall tutor me lol,btohqsg

someone just humble me if it‚Äôs not possible. is it possible to go jc after gap year after o levels,btohqsg
Someone get this comedian a medal,btohqsg

How tf U forget so fast,btohqsg
but REC 3122 YAO TECK why are u still awake,btohqsg
arent even asked in a lvl,btohqsg

even o lvl dont have those,btohqsg
i think that is poly level,btohqsg
but weird coz they gonna final exam soon init,btohqsg
coz i dont rmb drawing that,btohqsg
h3 phy electricity qns got other stuff to test lol‚Ä¶,btohqsg
At least ik his class got give coffee,btohqsg
I feel like I heard of her,btohqsg
I just rmb her as pregnant cher,btohqsg
at least not the ntu h3 physics,btohqsg
My friend in her class right,btohqsg
Say she don't take their class alrd cuz preggo,btohqsg
the whole thing is on semicon and i just don't think it's taught well la,btohqsg
rip gonna taking it soon lol,btohqsg
tbh i still cant find anyone that teaches it well,btohqsg

sci is huge diff from eng,btohqsg
Ohya Mr Chen married to dorcas,btohqsg
Then UK what my classmates say,btohqsg
"""eh how is she attracted to him ah""",btohqsg
yea the ntu one starts with like physics of crystals then go into the band gap all those before going into semicon like fermi dirac statistics,btohqsg
i feel is less detailed compared to ntu,btohqsg
i mean you don‚Äôt need to know as in depth,btohqsg
What in the demonic satanic ritual is this,btohqsg
Ngl it feels like some eye illusion test,btohqsg

ya just telling u how semicon works,btohqsg
I did and my brain ain't braining,btohqsg
then if you want donor just throw in some phosphorus,btohqsg
pretty sure there is some equations to this but i dont need to know,btohqsg
and I'll rub it in your face,btohqsg

maybe suddenly one year got no more discoveries in physics so dont have lol üòÇ,btohqsg
bruh people are getting awarded nobel prizes now for stuff did in the 1980s,btohqsg

if they die alr  the 10m goes to who,btohqsg
you can't be awarded the nobel if you're dead,btohqsg
no you just can't get it,btohqsg
you're only eligible if you're alive,btohqsg
and the dude that proof Einstein's theory on gravitational waves are correct,btohqsg
If you die before a certain age you can't take the $ out,btohqsg
only way is if you get awarded it but you die before receiving the prize,btohqsg
which is like 2 months period,btohqsg
Didn't Einstein work with two brothers on smth,btohqsg
I forgot what was it on,btohqsg
Iirc There's this pic of all the Nobel prize winners in one photo,btohqsg
ya and if someone decided to shoot them during the photo shoot u literally can have at least half of your chapters in h2 phy gone,btohqsg
just shoot newton and a lot of it is gone alr,btohqsg
no need go after nobel prize winners,btohqsg

How is it compared to guzheng,btohqsg
Yq almost like every string used bruh,btohqsg
it is part of percussion section back then,btohqsg
By right it shld belong to tby section,btohqsg
Is it cuz of how fast u have to hit the notes,btohqsg
