I see. I used to pay NTUC insurance via AXS with GPMC topped up with AMEX TCB. Now after the nerf any other ways to pay with some cashback...?,btohqsg
No more cashback liao. GPMC blocks AXS transactions now as well,btohqsg
Visa platinum Maybank is yours next,btohqsg
I applied for 1 month via hsbc online form but no rep contacted me,btohqsg
Anyone knows the answer to this? If opting for BRS and property  still can touch the RSTU funds or must opt for FRS at 55 then can touch the RSTU funds,btohqsg
can see the example from Dollars and sense at #3,btohqsg
but tldr: RSTU funds cannot be touched,btohqsg
Thanks! So only if i hit FRS i can withdraw RSTU  if i opt for BHS (even though i have FRS) i still cant touch those money until monthly payout. Lol such an odd rule. For ppl who choose to or no choice will never hit FRS  might as well dont top up,btohqsg
Even with BHS only  we still can and should do SA shielding right?,btohqsg
1 easy way around this is topup ma instead of sa. Ma funds will flow into sa once u maxed out your ma.that way the sa funds aren’t reserved and u can withdraw,btohqsg
Hi all  simple question - can I check when is the monthly interest payout for OCBC 360 Savings account?,btohqsg
This is a good way too for ppl who wants tax relief or wants to save for retirement. I used to contribute yearly to RSTU and VCMA. Since this is the case  i wont want to put more cash into cpf  still can consider VCMA but will thibk thrice abt putting cash into cpf,btohqsg
Within 7 business days of the month,btohqsg
My typo  it's 0.05%. Weird that the interest is credited on 24 of each month.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the interest to be given on ocbc 360 is calculated at end of month or on payout day,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for the webull 'get 5 free shares promo for any amount parked for > 30d promo'. Does anyone know where to find what free shares can I potentially get?,btohqsg

hi chris  for the scb wealthsaver priority.. to get the additional 3% interest only applies if one is a completely new customer right? so if one currently already hold an esavers account  one won't qualify right?,btohqsg
You can't choose it. It's a lucky draw.,btohqsg
Technically yes  but do confirm with SCB on that,btohqsg

"noted from the TNC ""Complete and submit the online application using MyInfo via Singpass in the samesession on HSBC (Singapore) website by 31st March 2023. For avoidance of doubt  an Eligible Participants who submit the online account application without using MyInfo via Singpass (i.e. via manually completing the Digital Account Opening Form) will not be considered as an Eligible Participant.does this mean this promotion is not available for those can only apply at their branch (like those who have credit card but subsequent cancel  therefore cant apply at their website)?",btohqsg
im surprised that payment from HSBC EGA to HSBC card also take abt 1-3 days to reflect,btohqsg
can i ask  would it be better to use citi prestige or maybank visa infinite for insurance payments?,btohqsg
Maybe not very sure about that 👀 might have to ask their CS,btohqsg
