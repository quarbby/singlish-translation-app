I think that‚Äôs the US stock discussion,btohqsg
China Star Food has formed a bullish pennant pattern. PA showed well absorbed at 47 on a T+4. More upside expected.,btohqsg
Marco Polo ($0.018/$0.019)It touched recent high of $0.025 on 21st Jan 2021 and retraced back to strong support level ($0.017-$0.018). We can see lower prices rejection from the lower wicks at $0.017.Good closing today at $0.018 after hidden buying power came in back at $0.017 and then cleared $0.018.The late action today shows that they might be coming back in play and reversal back up from this downtrend.Good luck  DYODD.Market is shaky now. We have to react accordingly if things don‚Äôt go to plan.,btohqsg
CFM Holdings warns of higher net loss for H1 2021https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cfm-holdings-warns-of-higher-net-loss-for-h1-2021METAL-STAMPING firm CFM Holdings expects to record a higher net loss after tax for the half-year ended Dec 31  due to a decline in gross profit margin  it said in a filing to the Singapore Exchange on Tuesday.,btohqsg
Nope . I am not bro. U?,btohqsg
Just some news for CFM holders or planning to hold CFM long term.,btohqsg
Most Penny stocks should not be for long term.Once pennies music stop  many will be in freezer.,btohqsg
Long term counters  really need those that give dividends then at least it makes sense to buy up. üí™üèº,btohqsg
Hope energy and gloves uptrend continue tommorow.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think they will lose too much too. Couple millions . Not too bad .  Many other pennies lose A lot more but still can be fried up. Ultimately   as long as no suspension and BBs select them to play   they can be played up,btohqsg
Most importantly is cannot have debt issues. cFM gearing is little high at 75% but not yet cause for concern as they have Low float 200 million shares  they need money can always raise more.,btohqsg
Why our oiles hardly run today. Bb Sian liao?,btohqsg
I bought Rex by instinct today üòã,btohqsg
My exact sentiments with dax bro John,btohqsg
A lot of companies lose a lot more money and BBs still play them.For pennies   BBs presence is more important than the FA.,btohqsg
Costs high due to supply chain increased prices.A lot of suppliers are raising prices now due to increased freight rates by Shipping / logistics,btohqsg
Am more worried about market overall sentiments than minor business losses.If sentiments can recover  BBs play and nothing much to worry.Today late afternoon got some play ups. Hoping it is to ready up tomorrow then that‚Äôs good for us all,btohqsg
Yea man  take is easy. The losses is expected. COVID19 period . Many companies not doing well.Pennies playing by rank is1) sentiments2) spotting BBs3) PA4) TA5) FAAs long as no money issues and have SL  can play any counters,btohqsg
Sea ltd 250 go go go ,btohqsg
min order for material meaning it‚Äôs their downstream suppliers that are imposing those MOQ which is no surprise especially in their industry.... so even tho they‚Äôre generating more revenue from their lower operating cost  their incurred higher cost of goods from purchasing more materials than they should outweighs the revenue i guess...,btohqsg
‚Äú...attributable to an increase in cost of sales from minimum-order requirements for material purchases  tooling and tooling material purchases  higher direct labour costs as well as sub-contract services for its metal stamping operations...‚Äùthe minimum order requirements comes from their downstream of the supply chain- meaning they probably only need to buy 10pcs of stamping tools in the past but now there‚Äôs a e.g. MOQ of 50pcs from their source  they‚Äôve to follow and buy 50pcs instead OR  buy lesser but incur higher unit cost.^at least this is my unds from the BT article that youve shared.anyway it is what it is lor the article quite plain and direct liao.,btohqsg
cos something that i‚Äôm a bit familiar with and hope to help you shed some light on your doubts with my minimal knowledge ü§™,btohqsg
They have more inventory now it seems .,btohqsg
it‚Äôs very common to have MOQ. Cant expect a machine to operate to produce 1 tool only. need to maximise your machine‚Äôs capacity as well haha,btohqsg
hahaha in this economy.... everybody also wanna tan jiak one....,btohqsg
The MOQ is on tools ? Or raw material items. If so they more of it and should add to their inventory.More costs incurred for now but the following quarter might not need to incur.So it doesn‚Äôt seem so bad,btohqsg
See how they play tomorrow and react accordingly will do bro.,btohqsg
you dyodd ah i‚Äôm only explaining on the supply chain part idk about their financials much but to me warning of higher net loss doesn‚Äôt sound like good news..... so u agar agar lor,btohqsg
Already on my watchlist. Only thing is need to see whether BBs come to play .,btohqsg
I concentrate on my existing counters for now.,btohqsg
the last time they also warn of higher net loss for FY20 so not the first time.... next day gapped down 6 pips too.,btohqsg
