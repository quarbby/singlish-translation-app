You went to the branch sign up ?,btohqsg
Oh this sms means i have signed up for it?Another question i have. does hsbc compare the july balance with my may or june balance when calculating the july interest?,btohqsg
If you registered in Jun then reference month is May. If you registered in Jul then reference month is Jun.Everyday+ Rewards is always 1 month before.,btohqsg
It means they received your SMS liao.,btohqsg
I see online have 10% off for residents  will get the same onsite?,btohqsg
Cant buy online when u onsite?,btohqsg
I already say in the group yesterday. Those having hsbc cards can't sign up online. Need to go branch sign up EGA,btohqsg
Read more talk less ‚ùåTalk more don‚Äôt read ‚úÖ,btohqsg
This is signing up for the promotion not signing up for the EGA account. You really should read what they are referring to before making any comments,btohqsg
A daily dose of commenting without understanding,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to GO DOWN to the branch to register for the promotion. Just sms will do. Imagine everybody went down to branch just to tell the bank they want sign up  bank very free meh,btohqsg
I understand... I going to the branch soon for EGA acc,btohqsg
Ok thanks for updating us on what you are going to do,btohqsg
Make sure you go down branch to register every month‚Ä¶Get your queue number.Send the SMS in front of the CSO.This is the confirm sure way you will be registered.,btohqsg
No. Go branch is to get EGA done..,btohqsg
You bring whole family go? One time do all.,btohqsg
Don't understand why hsbc still operate until 5pm... scb already open until 7pm,btohqsg
Ya I also dont understand why some mcd 24 hours but my nearby mcd close at 11pm,btohqsg
lol first time I encountered. Uob credit card statement generated on Sunday 9th June.,btohqsg
Operating 24 hrs are open when there is higher crowds,btohqsg
Saturday your house key cannot work?,btohqsg
Maybe auto generated  so work 24hrs  where there is higher crowds,btohqsg
Hi  like to know is there any to get cashback or miles if merchant only accept paynow,btohqsg
Perhaps search chat history ‚ÄúPaynow cashback‚Äù?,btohqsg
4% + Extra 2% that is ‚Äúpossible‚Äù once a year doesn‚Äôt make the EIR 6% . !!,btohqsg
2 accounts makes it possible for a whole year. But depending on the promo's cash reward also.,btohqsg
via grabpay but need to topup. Commonly known is topup with uob absolute for 0.3%,btohqsg
Hi all  like to ask for big item on sealy mattress with kris+ beside using uob krisflyer  what alternative credit card gives best cashback . Best it helps to meet $500 spend for ocbc/uob one savings account (not a must),btohqsg
Hi. May I ask. If use healthhub app to pay hospital bill. Using Citi reward card need pair with amaze? Or use directly will do? Thanks,btohqsg
Need 3 accounts to make it work  AND if UOB change interest rates shortly after your fund is locked  nothing you can do.,btohqsg
Maybe he include the non-UOB bank account as part of the 3 ü§™,btohqsg
Why need 3 accounts? And the information is correct as of now  who knows when the interest rate will change and what the promo amount is,btohqsg
Userzavis.‚Äãhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:do not send unrelated links without context,btohqsg
HSBC EGA got 1% more from Everyday+ rewards  how is it equally good?,btohqsg
Maybe his gf in this chat  then his gf know got extra % for hsbc will ask him xfer money,btohqsg
Like that I won't take esaver. Take EGA,btohqsg
The gf knows can eat him 750 but eat him 350 only. So no need worry ü§£,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt take both? Rotate your funds around,btohqsg
I'm overwhelmed with messages in Honey Money that I have stop reading.Is there a tool to help skip all the Terry messages or hide from view. sometimes more than 1/2 the messages generated or replied to his post that is not useful and really affecting the quality of this chatgroup.Not sure how admin can help on this.,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone here have tried the loopholes on ocbc360 account(e.g credit your ocbc 360 account from your other bank accounts as salary) with success?,btohqsg
There are some data points  you can also try and let us know,btohqsg
I feel the same too. This was exactly why he was banned in other groups because he was always flooding the chat with useless comments.,btohqsg
I tried last month but it doesn't seem to work. Ocbc360 doesn't credit the interests that I should be getting,btohqsg
From another bank with another name?,btohqsg
From another bank but same name,btohqsg
You could use the search function in Telegram  use keywords of the topic and questions you have in mind :),btohqsg
Shhh... quiet now.MutedTerry .‚Äãfor 30 days.Reason:Please take your time and read to learn from others during this period before you provide your own comment,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I will try for the next month if this really works,btohqsg
Does the app not tell you whether you have met the criteria or not? You can try this month and check if it has met if the app can tell you if you met or not.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not necessary to read through every single messages. You can just search what you want to find thru searchI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to blame those that replied to him as we did answer to his question but he still doesn‚Äôt understand it after multiple times,btohqsg
You can xfer this month as well tho? Why need to wait for next month,btohqsg
My app does not inform me anything. Just that when I check my interest credited the amount is not correct,btohqsg
Hi  for Giro setup to make other bank credit card payment via EGA  i have to use the manual Giro forms from the respective individual banks? Thanks,btohqsg
The website does. You can login and check,btohqsg
Said wrongly. I meant for the month of June,btohqsg
You can check on the ocbc web  it will say how much salary was credited. Did you not receive the salary interest? Or which interest did you not receive.It‚Äôs either you get or you don‚Äôt get. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúamount not correct scenario‚Äù,btohqsg
Yes. You also need to setup signature with HSBC at the branch before you submit any forms,btohqsg
Do you meant the bank will inform me if I login through ocbc online banking via PC instead of mobile banking?,btohqsg
I see thanks. I usually checked via mobile banking. Mobile app doesn't tell me anything,btohqsg
Anyone knows if UOB Krisflyer Credit Card annual fee is waivable?,btohqsg
not sure  cause some miles credit cards do not allow fee waiver no matter what,btohqsg
Hi  anyone here investing with bigfundr? Can share how legit and if satisfy ?,btohqsg
Using Maybank fnf card for bus/mrt a few days. The fare doesn‚Äôt show up in app or in Apple Pay even though 2 weeks alr,btohqsg
You can check SimplyGo app and bank app (after posted).Transactions for MasterCard contactless (like Maybank F&F) will accumulate for 5 days of trips/$15 of fares  whichever earlier.Transactions for Visa contactless will accumulate daily.The accumulated transactions will only post after 3 days  which will take another 3 business days (based on experience) to reflect on the bank app.The longest for MasterCard contactless will be about 11 business days from the first trip.,btohqsg
Hey. Did you received your interest? I‚Äôm tempted to try with them as well. Will be happy to hear your thoughts. Thanks,btohqsg
He straight left the groupchat  so he's probably not gonna read to learn anything lol,btohqsg
He joined another one  immediately after he was muted,btohqsg
I think his BS quite refreshing leh. Till I try to reply his qn. Good read but cannot take it personal üòÜ,btohqsg
Hahaha so fast? Still got whose group he‚Äôs not banned yet,btohqsg
Now he want to add me to his group so he wont be banned since it is his groupüò¢,btohqsg
Probably die off after awhile. Who would post question?,btohqsg
For him to share his updates. üëçüèª,btohqsg

Need to add Sui to that group to balance it üòÇ,btohqsg
So far Is Heymax pretty accurate ?.. trying to check some restaurants that hsbc revo giving bonus points,btohqsg
For the most of it yes (since HSBC Revolution is VISA)  but not as accurate and reliable as empty Amaze wallet method.,btohqsg
This chat group is my place to talk rubbish whenever I‚Äôm bored hence I also changed my name for this purpose so my friends in real life don‚Äôt laugh at me.,btohqsg
Touch√©  but again final decision by the owner of this public group chat. Certain rules need to be observed. üòÖ,btohqsg
Back to mourning for UOB EVOL card and finding next best alternative.For those who have left UOB One account can look at SCB Smart Credit Card for 6%-ish cashback.1. Reward ispoint basedinstead of direct cashback (need to redeem üëéüèª  but can rollover üëçüèª)2. Can be considered as semi-general spend card asbonus pointsare awarded only for'Qualifying Merchants'  but base points are still awarded for non-'Qualifying Merchants'3.No annual feeperpetually4.No minimum spendrequired (but take note on how points are awarded)5.Base pointswill be awarded based on1.6 points per $1 on each transaction(data point)6.Bonus pointswill be awarded based on17.6 points per $1 on total accumulated 'Qualifying Merchants' transactions(data point)7.Bonus pointsis capped at14400 pointsperstatement month(base points no cap)8.Points redemptionscan only be made inblocks of 3200 points($10 cashback)9. With the bonus points limit in place  the max optimised spending amount is $818.2  which clocks 15710 points (will not be so accurate best to track on Excel)10. With 15710 points  you can redeem 12800 points for $40 cashback (familiar number?)  but with leftover 2910 points (which you can accumulate another 290 points on the following month to redeem $10 cashback)Other information like exclusions and 'Qualifying Merchants' can be found on t&chere.Always read the t&c first before committing to anything.Appreciate Oscar's efforts to help correct any errors found.,btohqsg
Hi guys  let's say I've setup IRAS personal income tax GIRO payment plan to debit from account A.Can I amend the GIRO plan to debit from account B instead of account A?,btohqsg
When I see terry  I stop reading the chat and come back few hrs ltr,btohqsg
Maybe change to a new nick?,btohqsg
Read until point 3  which is wrong: ROUND(1.6*X 0) is the formula. $0.90 will earn base 1 point.,btohqsg
Yes. Just apply for a new GIRO application and it will override the old one. Note that non DBS/UOB/OCBC bank account need to use mail  and no BRE provided.,btohqsg
He can start a new YouTube channel too üòÉ,btohqsg
Point 6 is wrong  not in blocks of 3600 points. It is redeemed in blocks of 3200 points (=$10).,btohqsg
Well I'm just basing off t&c. The rounding is on the points and not on the transaction spent. You need to remove the cents before you multiply by 1.6.The formula on Excel should be =ROUNDUP(FLOOR(x 1) 0).But if you have the card  you can send a screenshot of the 90¬¢ transaction with 1 base point awarded as a data point.See:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/207507?single,btohqsg
Before lowest bus fare became $1.09 I got my points. My expected and awarded points show my formula works perfectly. My experience vs your TnC interpretation,btohqsg
And this one is from Milelion article,btohqsg
Does FAVE fall under shopping for DBS live fresh?,btohqsg
All DBS cards exclude Fave from earning rewards,btohqsg
Nice but it doesn't tally with t&c. =ROUND(167*1.6 0) gives 267 instead of 268 on t&c. Maybe is =ROUNDUP(x*1.6 0) instead?Actual data point:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/207507?single,btohqsg
Anyone have amex highflyer exclusion list ?,btohqsg

Bonus is also ROUND  not ROUNDUP.No need. I will need to recalculate points for past 1.5 years.,btohqsg

From t&c  167 √ó 1.6 = 267.2 (but they rounded up to 268). False advertising on t&c. üò°Same for 167 √ó 17.6 = 2939.2 (but they rounded up to 2940). üò°,btohqsg
hi  is moomoo or webull better? Looking for a broker to use  taking into account the account opening promotion as well. Thank you.,btohqsg
Hi all payment through shopback qr is considered online right?,btohqsg
Hi for this month 30Jun is on a sunday. If i were to empty the hsbc ega account for next promotion  i will to do so by 29Jun? Anything i transfer out on 30Jun will only register it as on 01Jul ?,btohqsg
Yes. But Jul 31 days  you can be like Mt who will not risk it and pull out earlier. ü§£ Don't try to be JIT warrior can already.,btohqsg
Late to the party. Wanna ask about my Citi rewards card already added to the amaze card   and the amaze card is added to my Google wallet . If I use Google pay (amaze card ) to tap for transaction. Do I get the 10x points ? Or I must use the physical amaze card in order to get 10x points ?,btohqsg
either method is fine  as long as not blacklisted mcc e.g. hotels,btohqsg
How about shopback pay ? Also can get 10x points?,btohqsg
For the moomoo 6.8%. The count down to return is 3 days time. For the withdrawal to bank is it immediate or is it advisable to do it earlier?,btohqsg
If it's not blacklisted in t&c  then yes. If it is then no.,btohqsg
Cause tot will be like snack and will take few days to sell away the fund n receive the amount to bank,btohqsg
Means empty out before end of jun  put back on 1st jul   i will b eligible for both jun and jul incremental $ bonus interest?,btohqsg
No. Why put back in Jul?,btohqsg
But have you even receive the payout?,btohqsg
Ega promo is for jun-jul. jul needs incremental balance for bonus interest?,btohqsg
EGA is based on May for Jun-Jul cycle unless you are talking bout everyday rewards always compared to previous month,btohqsg
Everyday+ Rewards in Jul will reference Jun. You'll not get that 1%.,btohqsg
Hey experts I have an weird question to askI went polyclinic for dental and paid their using  uob one cc which I believe shoukd be excluded I their tnc....But somehow the interest tracker  increased (which means included in the 500 min spend for uob Savings account)Can I take it as since INtERst tracker moved its count towards uob one credit card spending as well?,btohqsg
UOB One CC exclusion and UOB One account exclusion are 2 different lists.,btohqsg
This one anyone use before? 5 Buy trades of stocks/etf what is the minimum price of stock?,btohqsg
I paid there physically not via healthhub (stupid mistake)I checked heymax polyclinic(I check jurong polyclinic on heymax but I didn't go that one) is mcc  8062 which should be excluded by uob Savings and cardWhich made me confuse so I asked,btohqsg
So based on the app  the transaction is already posted?,btohqsg
Are you sure the tracker has increased based on that transaction and not other transactions that have been posted?,btohqsg
100% positive becusse I was confuse and went to calculate myself hahah,btohqsg
Well maybe the tracker for UOB One account could still be valid but the card is risky. It determines whether you meet the tier or not. No harm to spend the amount again to cover.,btohqsg
What I can only think of is that maybe that polyclinic is not coded as hospital mcc,btohqsg
Thanks for the  advise (uob one bonus  account paid out already)But couple of days  left for rhe uob card one,btohqsg
Last month's transaction? You ask now also a bit late.,btohqsg
And just because it counts as interest tracker doesn‚Äôt mean it counts for uob credit card,btohqsg
It got posted on 31st so it's calculated towards last month on uob accountOne card dates are out of sync with the accountmy one  card is not up so double confirming it,btohqsg
There is a digital counter. I paid there,btohqsg
Maybe the digital kiosk different MCC ü§î like healthhub?,btohqsg
Likely it is a Healthub version in kiosk setup.,btohqsg
to conserve your amaze 1k cap you can just use crmc directly on shopback pay,btohqsg
Hello  I have fresh funds of 140k to park  Right now im considering HSBC EGA  I read that some banks allow self crediting of salary as part of the Salary requirement? Could anyone recommend or share details on the verified banks that allows for self-crediting? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Sounds about a correct guessNext time would just use healthhub app to pay for 100% ease of mind.Thanks guys for the help,btohqsg
HSBC EGA do not have salary crediting criteria.,btohqsg
Yup but the bonus interest isn't as high as other banks with Salary Crediting requirement thus im wondering if I could make use of those bank and self credit salary if that works.,btohqsg
4.65% p.a. in Jun is pretty much the highest.,btohqsg
Just with salary crediting your interest won‚Äôt be high as well. There‚Äôs other criteria‚Äôs to fulfill. All the main banks allow self credit of salary,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a new DBS card holder and thinking of opening a bank account too. Would anyone know how the best order for the posb cashback bonus and the DBS multiplier account promo? I‚Äôm a bit confused by it being a new DBS credit card customer,btohqsg
citi rewards  citi privi miles or citi premier miles for cardup payments?,btohqsg
citi rewards 0.4mpd  citi premiermiles 1.2mpd. There is no citi privi miles card. Why only these cards?,btohqsg
May i check for esaver current promo above - for july interest  which month is the reference month? Is it May or jun?,btohqsg
Your screenshot answered your own question. May.,btohqsg
Thanks. It is not the case for hsbc ega ?,btohqsg
Depends on what you're asking about.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/207339,btohqsg
This bonus interest - reference month,btohqsg
Answered in the link I sent,btohqsg
typo: UOB privi miles. Considering UOB provi/citiRewards/citiPremierMiles for cardUp for general spend  rental and income tax. Currently using UOB one savings+ lady for dining  DBS woman world for travel. Open for better suggestions,btohqsg

For the HSBC EGA Bonus Interest pay out does anyone know when will it be paid? Say if I put money into it for June and July  Can I take out my money in the month of August? The T&C says pay out by 30 Sept.,btohqsg
You should not put in for more than a month. You answered your own qn for when it'll be deposited into your account.,btohqsg
As in like if I were to take out the money before the interest pay out  will it forfeit my bonus interest?,btohqsg
No. It's based on incremental MAB.,btohqsg
So sad‚Ä¶ my best friend never PM me‚Ä¶ ü•≤,btohqsg
Any link ? I need some entertainment,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have. He probably hates me.,btohqsg
Hello is citi rewards plus Instarem amaze the best combi for credit card spending (no min spend)?,btohqsg
What do you want to achieve?Usually I recommend UOB or DBS because miles can pool together.Citi Rewards can compliment your miles journey  but cannot rely on it. Spend max $1000 also won‚Äôt earn meaningful redemptions.,btohqsg
Just wondering  is there any telegram group similar to this and heymax but for shopback?,btohqsg
For me I'm a light spender ~500 per month  and don't want think so much CRMC +amaze for me is an obvious choice,btohqsg
One good thing is Citibank got CitiPayAll.What kind of redemptions have you made so far?,btohqsg
Not yet made redemption  first month using this card  just nice 10k points,btohqsg
You have other card for miles worth considering?,btohqsg
Nope. If your spending is $500. I think your choice is great.,btohqsg
Okayy for me important thing is also whether card is useful for multiple purposes. For card like uob lady I will only get for travel to compliment my CRMC amaze  especially if I need to travel/book flights alot,btohqsg
Terry living in your mind rentfree,btohqsg
UOB can change category  possible to cover everything if you know how.,btohqsg
you were supposed to destroy Terry not join him,btohqsg
There's 1k cap on amaze ?,btohqsg
1% fee if use Amaze+card more than 1k for domestic spend,btohqsg
Wow didn't know about this . Thanks !But for international spend got cap ?,btohqsg
Is putting into fixed deposit with guarantee interest ~3% good method to invest or save up?,btohqsg
Depends on your age / risk / investment profile.Typically more suitable for older folks with larger amount of assets since you won‚Äôt grow your wealth very much with 3-4% pa.,btohqsg
Yeah true..  more to low risk appetite n looking for something guaranteed.. stock market seems volatile and not guaranteed earnings,btohqsg
Tbills average around 3.6-3.7. SSB average around 3.2-3.3  so if you want something guaranteed and safe  can go for these 2. MMF is generally quite safe and average around 3.7 but there‚Äôs  still an investment risk involve,btohqsg
Hi all  new to all these so I‚Äôve gone for the UOB one account and just applied for UOB EVOL on 1st June for the cash credit promotion. My card got approved on the 5th and I am still waiting for the card but have just learnt that they have changed both the promotion as well and the cashback in August suddenly without warning. The promotion now is Apple Watch SE but only applies if the application is on the 7th June!? And previous cash credit promotion for June was no longer able to be found. Wonder if it is still worth using this card or just apply for an alternative card?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think I can apply for another UOB credit card for promotion anymore because I am no longer ‚Äúnew to UOB credit card‚Äù because of the EVOL approval for any promotions. So I‚Äôll just have no promotions at all?,btohqsg
1) what rewards did you choose? You can just fulfil the criteria to get the rewards and cancel it at a later stage2) the new nerf only kicks in in August so you have 2 months to still earn cashback based on the current tnc3) if the tnc states that you have to be a new to card  then I guess you have to stick with evol for now,btohqsg
You can still fulfill the promotion with UOB EVOL. The card is still top tier till the new t&c take effect.Afterwards you can look at UOB One card to fulfill your $500 spending and get at least 3.3% cashback  and a lot more if you spend mainly on selected merchants.,btohqsg
The reward initially when I applied for EVOL was up to $560 cash credit on 1st June. But the website changed & the rewards changed as well on I assumed 7th June to this new reward,btohqsg
Then you can fulfil the criteria to get the rewards and seeing if you still want to continue the card at a later stage. Main thing now is to get the reward since you have alrd applied for it,btohqsg
Can keep the card until they can‚Äôt waive your annual fee or if you want to be a new to uob card  cancel it( please read what date the promotion tnc states  rewards might be voided if card is canceled by a certain date)   then apply it probably 6-12 months later,btohqsg
https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/uob-evolThe initial offer can still be found on the moneysmart website but not anymore on UOB website,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see anything regarding 560$ cash credit,btohqsg
‚ÄúUOB may  at any time and at its discretion terminate the Promotion and/or amend any of the Terms  and all persons shall be bound by such amendments.‚ÄùSo I assumed that have voided this promotion and replaced it with the Apple Watch but only takes effect for those who applied after 7th June. So nothing for those who applied from 1-6 June.,btohqsg

I doubt so too haha. Just think that it‚Äôs kinda trashy for them to do this. Even for the Apple Watch promo now  it‚Äôs only for first 50 new applicants,btohqsg
Not sure if I still need to do the minimum spend of $1000 for 2 months with this uncertainty.,btohqsg
Honestly their promos are so uncertain and expensive it's just not worth it lol,btohqsg
I believe this is still the criteria you need to fulfil. Not the one on uob website,btohqsg
Yeaa spending 1k consecutive for 2 months when you don‚Äôt even know if you are the first x application,btohqsg
Annual fee waiver is usually quite easy if spend some amount every month even if is small  depending on bank I heard amex wont waive?,btohqsg
Yea but now we‚Äôre talking about evol  like why even spend on the card anymore lolI have been getting waived on my Amex so it‚Äôs still up to the bank‚Äôs discretion ba,btohqsg
Ohh ya true nerf until like this not worth to keep card,btohqsg
Also  is the group‚Äôs consensus to move out of UOB one after August? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
I got wavier for Amex TCB,btohqsg
No link with uob one account? Nothing is changing for uob one in August. Unless you got insider news,btohqsg
I think quite a lot have already moved out early Jun. After their earmark release in May.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt wait to see what new stunt uob is coming up with in plunging chicken,btohqsg

Hi! Any opinions on whether it is worth to get the UOB krisflyer savings account?I‚Äôm kinda attracted by the 6mpd for this. But not very sure if it‚Äôs worth just for this.,btohqsg
Hmmm. Why tho? Wouldn‚Äôt the uncapped miles as 6mpd be good?,btohqsg
Or am I understanding the bonus miles wrongly?üòÖ,btohqsg
Have u read the tnc before on uob krisflyer saving account  there is cap based on your mab saving in the acct,btohqsg
Ohh I haven‚Äôt read it. But I‚Äôm a bit confused about it. The cap is in relation to the 6mpd?,btohqsg
Maybe u should read it up before asking if worth or not. There is simple reason why people dont talk about uob krisflyer saving account in the first place.,btohqsg
Not sure what is amount  but probably,btohqsg

I'm looking to pay for my wife's hospital bill for baby delivery  but with the recent nerfing of the HSBC revolution card  are there still good options? I also have Citi premier miles and UOB privimiles. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
It is just a platform for merchants to receive online payments.It MAY follow the mcc of the merchant.Chan brothers uses red dot and the mcc is 4722.It doesn‚Äôt mean all red dot = 4722,btohqsg
Erm  hospital bill dont qualify for all the card u list if pay in hospital. Which hospital is your wife delivering at?,btohqsg

Good morning everyone. For June HSBC EGA bonus promo campaign  I understand max incremental ADB  in June is 365K to get the 4.65%. If one has HSBC debit card spend and/or has giro transactions that gives 1% cash back  I assumed the maximum incremental June ADB to get 4.65% would reduce. But I read HSBC‚Äôs site and tncs. It looks like these are 2 separate pools. Can I confirm that regardless of other 1% cash backs via giro or debit card transactions  the maximum incremental ADB in June that one needs to maintain is 365K?,btohqsg
Can I use my UOB visa signature for nets payment for merchant?,btohqsg
The merchant does not have a paywave machine  the only machine is a nets machine.,btohqsg
No if using as CC. But you can pay with NETS with ATM pin.,btohqsg
Means money deduct from bank account directly without 4mpd  right?,btohqsg
I completed May 2024 challenge  any idea when the vouchers will be credited or appear in my account?,btohqsg
Hello all  just want to ask you guys opinion if it is ever good to use a credit card (1.2mpd -1.4mpd card) directly instead of using amaze? As the saving is only 0.5% - 1%. But those cards have an overseas spending rate. Anyone thinks it's worth the 1% fees?,btohqsg
there is no min adb to maintain. The 1% interest from everyday+ rewards is capped at $300 monthly but still get 3.65% after that that.,btohqsg
Depends how u value a mile,btohqsg
Not worth to use 1.2mpd-1.4mpd card with Amaze for overseas spend as there is markup of about 2%.There is no 1% fee for overseas spend using Amaze+ card,btohqsg
I am confused. So in your opinion it is better to use 1.2mpd - 1.4mpd card directly  instead of amaze?,btohqsg
Just use 0FX cards. The 3.25% (direct) or ~2% (via Amaze) both far cost of the value of 1.2mpd,btohqsg
But direct you get more than 1.2mpd,btohqsg
But u said u are using 1.2 card?,btohqsg
Most 1.2mpd have overseas earn rate. Other than UOB KF.,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  but 2.2mpd for 3.25% FX is still buying miles at ~1.48cpm. If you value a mile to be 1.5cpm+  then maybe is worth it?,btohqsg
"Hi all  can i check that the cells highlighted in green are the optimal ""MAB"" to be in? E.g i start off at $96500 (1st month) and end at $102000 (final month) before resetting?",btohqsg
Is OCBC 360 bonus interest in?,btohqsg
use Amaze+ 3-4mpd cards instead? or 4mpd cards direct,btohqsg
I do use 3-4mpd card  these cards I never use direct. But as you know most of those cards have a monthly cap.When comes to buying watches and branded bags  no way I am going to earn 0.4mpd for those spending.That is why I am asking for opinion if direct or amaze is better. As direct earns up to 2.4 mpd (HSBC T1 & UOB PRVI),btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion.,btohqsg
Buying watches and bags overseas  you can consider Amaze + UOB KF CC. But do check the MCC of the merchant matches the UOB KF CC MCC whitelist before you proceed.,btohqsg
UOB prvi has 2.4mpd so it's 1.35cpm. it's not bad if one wants to be miles chaser. But I agree w you that better use amaze with 4mpd card like crmc/UOB lady for overseas.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if linked UOB one to amaze  will it count as credit card spending? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
if it can even be linked  then yes(uob one is visa  cannot link to amaze),btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion.,btohqsg
Noob   question tho. How do you guys count cpm?,btohqsg
cost divided by # of miles,btohqsg
But there is no cost here.,btohqsg

Hi guys. Any of you invested in either one of this?,btohqsg
This is from UOB tmrw app btw,btohqsg
Some merchant use nets machine to accept cc too. Just ask if they take cc,btohqsg
Isnt this like robo investment or something like that? I forgot whats that called,btohqsg
Nope I invest through UOBAM instead,btohqsg
Not sure. I was just exploring the app and found this.,btohqsg
How are they different? And do I have to sign up soearately for the UOBAM?,btohqsg
Yea  not sure what‚Äôs the difference. Probably the fund types,btohqsg
Do I need to sign up a new account or I can use the same old UOB app?,btohqsg
Why not just download the app and try,btohqsg
My experience with these 2 UOB apps is UOB TMRW app will auto select the funds based on the risk profile you choose. Ex Low-Moderate Risk -> UOB Income Trust fund. As for the UOBAM Invest  you can directly choose the funds you want to invest. I guess for most people  if they dont want to dabble with stocks as investment  the risk profile -> fund option works best for them. I choose the Moderate Risk which selects the Income Trust fund for me  so far  it is giving me 4-4.8% returns.,btohqsg
Thanks Jeremy. Is there interest of 4.7% guaranteed or there might be a chance where you may lose you initial amount  like stock market investments. I'm new to this  and I thought of moving my savings into UOBAM Cash+ to earn the interest rather than letting it sit in my savings account collecting dust. Thank you,btohqsg
For recurring subscriptions for Netflix/Fitness First/Singtel  these are eligible MCC for Citi Rewards Card. Just to confirm  will I earn bonus miles for recurring CC transactions?,btohqsg
It is up to 4.7%. Your capital is not at risk of losing but I dont think the interest gain it is performing at that level yet. I put in 5 months and I gain 1.5%,btohqsg
"Oooooo now i get it. ""Up to""",btohqsg
It is up to 4.7 per annum  so 1.5 for 4 month is on track  u put tbill 3 plus percent also is per annum so i think u all need to learn how to view interest given in the correct manner,btohqsg

Thanks Melvyn  so even i empty on 1st July for 1st account  the impact will only really be the first day funds counted as not fresh fund but it will be min. since its based on july full month of 31 days per the ADB?

Even if the  payment is charge to foreign currency  but the processing gateway is in sg then I will not be able to get the 4mpd too right ? Thanks queenie,btohqsg
Sorry I don't understand what you're trying to say. It's just account 1 in Jun  account 2 in Jul  account 1 in Aug. Make sure you transfer out of HSBC before depositing into your other account. That's all.But yes unfortunately self transfers are limited to 250k per day.,btohqsg

Yea so if I have 2k SGD in the account..i can just move USD in and out the account without issues right?,btohqsg
How do u intend to move the usd in and out of the account.,btohqsg
To be more specific  I am considering moving Brokerages  where I move USD from one brokerage into EGA then into another brokerage without converting to SGD. I guess the question is whether this will work,btohqsg
U would likely incur fees thriceOnce for receiving usd into hsbc EgaOnce for tt out usd from hsbc egaOnce for receiving usd in your target brokerAnd this assumes your first usd out from broker has tt out fees waived.,btohqsg
Oh there is a fee for EGA to receive and send USD?,btohqsg
Yes.The only bank that I know of that can send usd out free of charge is scb. But it‚Äôs conditional on the receiving broker‚Äôs custodian bank.A very specific exampleUSD sitting in my scb foreign currency esaver could be remitted 100% free of charge into interactive brokers usd account (I can‚Äôt remember I think it was Jp Morgan New York).,btohqsg
Oh thank you very much! I guess its probably more worth to convert to SGD first and move it.,btohqsg
Yes since it only cost usd2 to convert at spot rate and sgd receive is usually free for us.But u face usd/sgd fluctuations.,btohqsg

Have a question regarding chris' video for zeroing uob one account anticipating the next promo.  Isnt it then forgoing the interest for this month?  Becos I don't have a 2nd account to transfer to.  Thus  would it worth it if I use uob stash account if the next promo really comes thru?  Thks.,btohqsg
Yes. Has credited in just now.,btohqsg
Is easy to waive DBS lady world master card annual fee?,btohqsg
No benefits mean easy to waive?,btohqsg
Sorry read wrong ü§£ I thought you asked is it worth to waive/pay.,btohqsg
2 different data points for you. I would say easy to waive.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/56357https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/198945,btohqsg
Right.  But I already have stash with 1k only.  Hope someone can share.,btohqsg
Shud be fine. I only ever have issues waiving SC and OCBC AF. Even Amex is easy to waive,btohqsg
You should consider opening another HYSA like HSBC EGA then.,btohqsg
I find Ega very confusing from their website.  Still trying to understand whether got the tier system and whether needs spending etc etc.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account already at 3% p.a.  putting 150k will reduce it further to 2.6% p.a. even with the $1000 cash credit. Might as well put in fixed deposits.,btohqsg
2 t&cs to focus on:1. HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo (for 3.6% p.a.)2. HSBC Everyday+ Rewards (for 1% p.a.)The base interest given by HSBC EGA is 0.05% p.a.  which will add up to 4.65% p.a.,btohqsg

Any card to suggest? As I was using hsbc before the nerf  so thinking of continuing cause I have existing points in the card. But happy to switch to another card if the benefits exceeds Revo.,btohqsg
If you want to utilise UOB Stash account for the next promo  you can opt to deposit and register fresh funds of 100k (not 150k). This will still yield you 3.51% p.a. if you do not take out the 1k you left in the account.Take note these numbers are based off the current promo and it may be reduced/increased at the mercy of UOB.,btohqsg
Think amaze + citi rewards should be better compare to revo based on your listed spendings,btohqsg
You mean hsbc and Citi also can remit out usd totally free. Or u meant scb can send to hsbc and Citi free?,btohqsg
Now with xnap not working  os grab wallet with amex cc top up the next best option if shops dont accept cc directly,btohqsg

Hi all  will like to check: I got a Tbill (bought with OA) maturing this month. I also plan to continue to use this amount for this month's Tbill. Can I use the proceeds in the CPFIA for that? Or do i need to transfer back to OA? Thank you !!,btohqsg

Hi  I am curious to know what bank/insituition converts USD-> SGD at  USD 2 spot rate. Was it HSBC or SCB or IBKR?,btohqsg
Can transfer money from bank n combine it with non-transferable money  use all the non transferable money n left with transferable money  then transfer the orphan money back to bank?,btohqsg
AMEX Pay with AMEX-issued cards works too.,btohqsg
Question is  will they use the transferable or non-transferable monies first? ü§™,btohqsg
For me  signed up AMEX TCB. 3% for 6mths for using AMEX pay,btohqsg
Nice will read up more on this,btohqsg
Last time I used Grabpay  Grab rules is using non-transferable first on your purchase. Not sure any change after that.,btohqsg
If you use GrabPay often  then orphan monies won't impact you. But if you don't use GrabPay often  you still need to find another use case for the orphan monies before topping up to spend and withdraw the transferable balance also. üôÉ,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre topping up via Amex cc  you can just use Amex pay tho? Why risk yourself for orphan cash,btohqsg
Maybe he meant UOB Absolute cashback?,btohqsg

Tbills using cash averages around 3.6-3.7. You can choose a competitive bidding to indicate the interest rate that you wish to get but it may not be a 100% allocation depending on the rate you indicate,btohqsg
I found out for June promotion the additional bonus will only be credited on the following month. But I not sure about the April promotion,btohqsg

Competitive bidding is almost always 100% allocation or none depending on the clearing price. However  non-competitive bids may be given an allocation below 100% depending on demand?,btohqsg

Yes. Only ESSO tho (if you pay via the Kris+App with Krisflyer UOB card. 3+0.5=3.5mpd total)That being said  renting cars on getgo or other platform where petrol cost will be reimbursed is best to go to esso to get free miles back,btohqsg

it is based on incremental monthly average balance (mab) compared to that of reference month. The more days in the month u keep the 100k in the account the higher the mab. No hack to this.,btohqsg

Hello gurus and shifus  please Can I check for the Maybank credit card signup rewards with singsaver or moneysmart  I am abit puzzled by the additional ‚ÄúCredit-Able account requirement‚Äù (on top of credit card spend) - does it entail a bank account and/or must keep minimum holding one?

Would there be any penalty if I redeem after 30 days?,btohqsg
Where would there be penalty to keep the fund longer?,btohqsg
I mean if I redeem it after 30 days as I have other uses for it,btohqsg
No. Are you willing to spend 2k on a card that don't give cashback or points?,btohqsg

they may or may not automatically cancel your old lady's card but both the cards share the same cap and categories so there's no actual benefit,btohqsg
i would take shorter since the interest rate now is very high and high interest rate will not last forever,btohqsg
Hi Gurus. Would like to seek and clarify regarding the Maybank Platinum Visa Card I understand that you need to spend consistently every quarter to get the tiered earnings. Could I check e.g. if I spent on 1 transaction for each month at $1000  does it still qualify? or is there a minimum number of transactions required?,btohqsg
2.65% p.a with salary + 500 spend.2.88% p.a. with bill payment + above.,btohqsg
As long it's not excluded. What are you spending on?,btohqsg
Probably people shifting from hsbc Revo,btohqsg
mortgage loan using cardup.What I meant is there a criteria whereby I have to spend e.g. minimum 5 transactions a month to qualify for the tiered cashback?,btohqsg
No. For me I only have 2 transactions per month. üëçüèªIf in the future you plan to use the card to pay insurance directly  it can only make up 50% of your monthly spend.,btohqsg
any cardup code for recurring payment for home loan ?,btohqsg

Hi just checking can we still use Nestia or liquid pay app for Sgqr payment or we can only use Amex pay for now only ?,btohqsg
Hahaha until this month. But I think they might extend,btohqsg
As in is it worth moving funds there?Let's say I have a uob stash acc right now there is below the 2% mark,btohqsg
LiquidPay should be can  but basically same as PayNow.. so no point to use it,btohqsg
Maribank and GXS also better. No have any special criteria also.,btohqsg
Have you max out all your other savings account? Or is this cash for your emergency fund,btohqsg
Yes my uob One is maxed,btohqsg
Just excess funds I guess lol ü§£,btohqsg
You can just open the account first  no fall below fee anyways,btohqsg
Max as in 150k? Then how about Ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Yes and no ocbc acc. Recommend maxing ocbc also? Before moving excess to elsewhere?,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs criteria. If no fuss  then gxs or maribank loh,btohqsg
Yeaaa the criteria abit off putting since I'm already doing the uob One... Hence why I have some excess in UOB Stash,btohqsg
But just received the invite for GXS so wonder ü§î,btohqsg
Can also rotate between HSBC EGA or SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Even if you salary credit and save  it‚Äôs alrd 3.2% below 75k. Much better than digital banks,btohqsg
So totally no more points to earn  only left is Amex pay for now right ?,btohqsg
AMEX Pay  Grab Pay depending on what card you have,btohqsg
Ocbc is not bad. Can hit salary + save criteria for almost 4% pa.   Low effort. Then self transfer to hit requirements for uob one.,btohqsg
Wow sounds like its only online payment within white list merchant that gets 4mpd,btohqsg
I see theirs sales staff kept having booth in MRT pushing passer by to sign up,btohqsg
Mari better than gxs mehMari bo pay now I think only can use in shoppee app I recall,btohqsg

and it doesn't have miles pooling (in the past) as well as no miles purchase facility...so it is very very hard to accumulate a worthwhile amount to redeem air tickets?,btohqsg
It has its uses before  like buying air tix that crmc can't buy. After all these nerfs  not any more.,btohqsg
yup i hear you.. it is more like a side kick to the main cards that you have maxed out.. since to buy air tickets  you would typically use UOB Lady with travel category for 6mpd,btohqsg
I like multiple player with the good card haha,btohqsg
Different spending habit of cos. It was quite ok for food last 2 years wasn‚Äôt it.,btohqsg
4mpd for food is so so only?uob lady is 6mpd for food.maybank FNF is 8% for 5812Citi cashback is 6% for 5812 5814,btohqsg
What is considered non-contactless these days lol‚Ä¶,btohqsg
