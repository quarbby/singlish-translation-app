UOB really want u to build the momentum of spending cos they only award 3.33% cashback by quartersas opposed to citii cashback+ flat cashback,btohqsg
^ UOB One First 3 months cashback can be pro-rated,btohqsg
U can check on your qualifying quarter via the UOB chat assistIn the TnC  I think there‚Äôs a clause which they may or may not exclude your first month for the first quarter  so it‚Äôs sort of a pro rated Cashback,btohqsg
