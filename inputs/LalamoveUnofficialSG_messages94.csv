When ppl spoil market  they will be tighter restriction. For eg. no alcohol after 10.30pm  s-scooter and ebike needs license  tray-return mandatory  etc. So Covid cases keep increasing  lockdown.,btohqsg
The new normal is to tell you it's normal to have lockdown every now and then.,btohqsg

Boycott this alcohol seller..previously still got put as car  today whole night put motorcycle,btohqsg
I saw many time. I dun take that order,btohqsg
Damn nonsense this kind of shop,btohqsg
Guys  take note for the alcohol delivery of sims drive and Ubi (octopus building)  they love to do late night delivery to ANYWHERE. Dunno exactly is got license to do so or not. I took a job 2 days ago to WEGCA Bukit Batok industrial. Sounds weird for a midnight delivery. Kenna Road Block along the way at Toh Tuck. TP check and question. Think skip such deliveries,btohqsg
By right alcohol stop selling at 1030,btohqsg
Shops yes. But those delivery I think islandwide still allowed to sell and deliver,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a loop hole to play around,btohqsg
The question is the locations they deliver to is all very out of way and weird,btohqsg
Nope. You can buy even after 10.30 as long is delivery,btohqsg
U can buy at coffee shop12am than being homeJust cannot drink,btohqsg
Well  when I delivered there  they ask me to stop at carpark and came over to collect. One ah Beng was smoking and came over. I suppose it‚Äôs a illegal joint lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the first and last I take such jobs,btohqsg
Just like the Dorm case  recently let those migraine worker go out to places like Little India  now the Dorm cases largest cluster now. Keep spoiling market  we keep sabotaging on our freedom.,btohqsg
Education to ppl is useless  must implement restriction  fine and punishment then ppl will listen.,btohqsg
You can still purchase alcohol after 10.30pm from a licensed alcohol retailer if you do it online  and the retailer can deliver to you if you are at a non-public place.,btohqsg
is it the ‚Äúsend within 1 hour‚Äù job?,btohqsg
See I told you guys  spoil market further more  now unvax ppl cannot even dine at hawker or enter the mall.,btohqsg

Thanks brothers. Really appreciate it. Drive safe & stay safe üôè Cheers,btohqsg
if they push back enforcement by 1 week  you should be fully vax by then.,btohqsg
"""Also  unvaccinated people who work in the mall  or third-party contractors such as food delivery riders or delivery personnel  can enter the mall as they‚Äôre tested regularly due to Rostered Routine Testing.""",btohqsg
But how do they know if we do swab test or not? Cant be everyday swab test just to enter mall as swab test result only valid for 24hrs only,btohqsg
U need to show them the swab test kit result.,btohqsg
Means i must bring the ART kit?,btohqsg

Weekday cant hit $150. Only weekend can. Personal experience,btohqsg
Hmm ok. Weekend my highest was $400+ max already,btohqsg
Difficult to maximise earnings when we try to stack and all the restaurants are always delaying handing the food to us when,btohqsg

DC fast charger only takes abt 30min to charge,btohqsg
Lucky sg no such problem. High EV price still deterring away buyers,btohqsg
Now hybrid is best option. Buy hybrid like no cheap . Prius like 130 or 140k,btohqsg
SameThe price differenceEnough to cover the petrolUnless u hoot 400km daily,btohqsg
That's y 9 out of 10 hybrid is a taxi or phv. Normal users cannot cover back,btohqsg
"The strategy on SG govt is to give a fake impression that own a EV is good and ""Cheap"". They will somehow take back $ via taxes  charging $ and COE.",btohqsg
Confirm lo. Cannot earn thru petrol. Must earn thru car price n all other taxes,btohqsg
If not gahmen how to bail out SIAü§£ü§£,btohqsg

Hello  may I ask once swipe ‚ÄúArrived at Pickup location‚Äù  the next page is confirm loading. The time of arrival is once I swiped ‚ÄúArrive at Pickup Location‚Äù or after I uploaded the photo of loading into vehicle?I asked LLM CS  seems like it is pegged to the time the loading is completed.,btohqsg
take photo of the parcel/food will do after u collected the item,btohqsg
The time start once u press loading,btohqsg
The problem is sometimes the food is not ready  den I arrived liao but cannot do loading. So just wait the the loading page?Cos I tried clicking back from the loading page  interestingly it asked me to swipe ‚ÄúArrive at Pickup location‚Äù. As if the first time I swiped was not recorded.,btohqsg
Did my first withadrawal on 11 Oct  till now cash haven't deposit into my OCBC account  is this normal?,btohqsg
Motorcycle how to bring trolley. They crazy,btohqsg
they previously suspend me till i buy bag,btohqsg
today buy alr then how ah,btohqsg
Wanted to check on this too - bank info we provide shld be bank card number or bank acc number?,btohqsg
When did suspension start? I don't have bag also.,btohqsg
idk also suddenly just tell me i kenna suspend till get bag,btohqsg
Huh? They suspend you becos you didn't get their bag?,btohqsg
based on my love letters on punctuality previously  they will record when your gps signal is at the pickup location  not when u swipe arrive or loadingif wait more than 10min contact CS to inform them of waiting time. pick up liao contact them again so that they can update the waiting fees,btohqsg
Pls be careful when claiming late fees. Any bonus or tips will disappear when they add the late fees,btohqsg
Icic. LLM CS is not very responsive though. I was trying to siam the grace parking period  yet the CS not responsive enough. Give and take liao.,btohqsg
This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Penalised for being on time.,btohqsg
sigh kena information fee $5.54 for a $6.00 add on for return trip. give up on them. if its not otw back i would have asked until i get the amount rightand during festive/busy periods  dont bother ask for waiting time. they themselves also busy,btohqsg
Is this really the case or is it just me?,btohqsg
bumping this again.  I quite despo now because been driving everywhere and it shows 0 jobs. Its going to be 14 days soon and I need at least 1 trip if not im gonna lose $30. Anybody has been in this situation before?,btohqsg
U call llm and ask betterThink your acct got prob,btohqsg
Confirm 100% daily got jobs posted one,btohqsg
Now there is job on the app  for tomorrow pick up 8am onwards100% is ur acct something wrong,btohqsg
Doesn't it means 1st 10 mins free..The 2nd 10 min block is +2.. so.. from 11 mins to 20 mins is +2..If food late 11 mins.. already can claim +2..,btohqsg
Which I feel abit too Low,btohqsg
Imagine you have a prebooked order  you will be penalised for being late also,btohqsg
Better than other delivery app.. no waiting fee.. just tat to claim it is quite leceh with cs...,btohqsg
Yes they said my account is working fine. So quite puzzling,btohqsg
I'm waiting for their reply tmr. Reinstall same thing happen,btohqsg
But if it is a per what is written here... then this is not right..,btohqsg
11-20 should be claimable according to their writeup.. u can always challenge them,btohqsg
Well.. then they are wrong.. coz from how it is written... 11 to 20=+221-30=+4 and etc etc..,btohqsg
U can write to management to clarify.. coz all this CS are just outsourced phone help only.. management will know better..,btohqsg
Hi guys  this happened to me during the wee hours today. Took up an order as shown. Received a call from a number and whatsapp from 2 different numbers  both saying to call/text back when arrive at pickup location. I arrived and called/texted back  guy replied to take picture of unit and send him so he can inform sender. After which he called back and said  to knock on the door  but i saw the windows were closed and it was dark. 2 cameras above the door  seems weird. He then asked if i had pen and paper  he wanted me to write smth. But i dont have any with me. He said its okay  he will just paynow me the money  but he blocked me on whatsapp and did not answer my calls. There were a few numbers in total  about 5  including 3 in the app. I had a hunch about the whole situation and made a police report. The police advised that if encounter any such orders again  dont accept any request to write anything  it could be a setup.,btohqsg
Ah long. Getting u to go disturb the pple stayg at the unit.,btohqsg
That why dont take individual order. Take those from shop.,btohqsg
Guys if its labeled as motorcycle car still can take?,btohqsg
Can. Just that it's still motorcycle rate.,btohqsg
Whatever order u can see... can take,btohqsg
Sry need to ask another noob question. Possible to cancel a scheduled order in advance?,btohqsg
Pay now received become slower n slower..  USD to received in the morning.. now afternoon also not yet in. No standard at all,btohqsg
Send cake book motor... Request to call before reach... Heavy rain...2 cakes... Big box,btohqsg

or take walker  ask to take trolley. help to push to your location,btohqsg
Should I choose 10 ft Lorry instead?,btohqsg
If u ask me  i say lorryNo way any llm car will send for uWeight is also another issue,btohqsg
Can i send washing machine via llm car?I think the driver saw my washing machineHe will chao kan me,btohqsg
Why LLM didn't ask the delivery man to compensate the lost package? Deduct money from the wallet.,btohqsg
This guy will be released in 12 months. Customers know the name of their lalamove deliveryman right?,btohqsg
Take picture n let us know the dimensions lo,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also lala driver  never intended to be stingy on which vehicle mode as I assume the 1.7m or 2.4m would have suffice,btohqsg
How can a washing machine fit in a car?,btohqsg
Fit this dryer in my car with seats folded down,btohqsg
Can fit is one thing.U order llm ask sedan car driver take and send to another place.Will the llm driver chao kan u not? So big and heavy,btohqsg
U willing to hurt ur back for a low car price...??Customers can be cheap but that doesn't mean we sacrifice our health for their cheapness...,btohqsg
This one I never go thru LLM. Ex LLM customer contacted me for alacart job,btohqsg
Can lift one person ah washing machine..?? U must be quite strong... üí™üí™üëçüëç,btohqsg
Dryer okay la‚Ä¶ washing machine never try before üòÖ,btohqsg
looks like will break my back if move alone haha,btohqsg
Did ur encounter complaints from LLM where u receive SMS saying the recipient complain of missing item 2 MTHS later ? I delivered successfully and the recipient received the item from me personally and now complain of missing item .,btohqsg
And LLM reserves the right to deduct my $. Wa biang  the recipient ate the cake already and now wants $ back,btohqsg
Tis kind no standard one. Trash,btohqsg
Very angry. How much did I make only? One delivery doesn't pay that much. And I have to pay so much for that cake,btohqsg
Always take photo of the goods with the door unit number for evidence and keep it for at least a year.,btohqsg
There should be a time limit for claims by customers,btohqsg
does anyone know if llm has insurance for lost or damaged packages  and what  if any  is the rider's liability?,btohqsg
Treat it as driver has to pay‚Ä¶ LLM never cover drivers,btohqsg
A year is a long time.LLM should set some limits on how long after a customer get his stuff  he can complain about issue. Cannot be 10 days after u make an order for delivery for a cake  den u realise u nv received the cake  or the cake is spoilt..After receiving any complain  it's reasonable to expect llm to approach the delivery guy  within 5 working days  to address the complain  like show picture as proof of delivery.To just deduct the $$ from the deliveryman's wallet is already wrong  as they are a middleman who should hear both side of the story.,btohqsg
So must be careful and take pics for evidence. Previously  kenna scammed. They never compensate nevermind. The trip $20. Only tell me can reimburse 25% after deducting LLM comm üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Treat it as pay school fees‚Ä¶ what to doü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I just signed up the other day. Spend $180 get $3 off for member or about 1-2% rebate. 30% off is much btr anyday,btohqsg
Car drivers do yll take jobs at cbd/city areas? Park illegally or pay the hefty fee?,btohqsg
Dont waste time complain to cs,btohqsg
U will not get any answer,btohqsg
Just work hard to earn back,btohqsg
Their attitude is take it or leave it,btohqsg
LLM dun care about the driver. They think they have many driver. so less anyone  they will have more then that to replace us. That's Y to them customer is ALWAYS right.,btohqsg
When LLM text me  they gave me a form to explain my situation and to provide evidence that I successfully delivered. Back in Aug  there was still no protocol to say have to take photos when delivering to recipients. Now I will make a point to take photo when delivering. Otherwise it's very unfair to drivers.,btohqsg
To be honest  we might not even remember what we had eaten last week how to remember something that was more than 2 months ago,btohqsg
In this day and age  with hp in hand  everything can be done immediately  so 7 working days to resolve issue like this is not unreasonable.U have 48 hours after ur delivery date  didn't receive or damage  to surface the issue  after which sorry.The agent then has 5 working days to check with the delivery man den get back.So record keeping for 1 month already gd enough,btohqsg
You mean 25%? When did it increase to 30%?,btohqsg
2 months liao how to prove sia? Recipient never flag out to sender on the missing items  come and blame our drivers. LLM also should make a stand that past a certain period of time  case closed liao. Cannot always open file again and ask for supporting evidence. Joke.And for food delivery  we can only take photo of the outside  but how we know inside quantity correct or not? Can‚Äôt be we open everything up and check one by one rite  not hygienic and practical. Recipient open up liao never check the food and feedback immediately  wait for 2 months den say. Eat also shit out liao  already flush down toilet bowl liao den say missing items from delivery. Joke la.Tell LLM go fly kite. Best is withdraw ur wallet every week. Lesser chance they deduct money from ur wallet  at most don‚Äôt drive for them.,btohqsg
