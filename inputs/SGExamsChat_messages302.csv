The way its applied is different for different grades,btohqsg
Can anyone tell me how hahah ^^,btohqsg
hellooo i'm finding a temporary job for like 2 weeks before the one i applied for bc that one requires me to be 16. anyone has any jobs to refer me to or anyth,btohqsg
As long as you have child debit card its pretty straightforward,btohqsg
I'm still confused between debit and credit,btohqsg
debit is your own money  credit is you borrow from bank and pay later,btohqsg
I didn't know cookie run oven bake has mala sauce cookie,btohqsg
debit deducts from your bank account directly upon payment.credit  bank pay first  you pay later at the end of month.,btohqsg
Will the bank charge interest for credit card,btohqsg
No they charge you a tonne if you’re late,btohqsg
Not if you are late in payment.,btohqsg
Credit card companies earn from merchants who pay a commission on every transaction.,btohqsg
but if you pay late  banks charge a 2% interest a month  with a 1.5% finance charge.,btohqsg
they already earn from the merchants.,btohqsg
what kind of job u LF?,btohqsg
but I'm contacting some employers rn,btohqsg
But why oni 2 weeks tho,btohqsg
"I dun get the part where you say "" before the one i""",btohqsg
so like I applied for one after my 16th bday,btohqsg
and then a lot of jobs req >16 yrs,btohqsg
so rn I looking for some before the actual job,btohqsg
Uncle think Michael Chilly is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
okay i think i might be giving up bc there's so many that I applied for that req >16 years old so I'll wait till after my bday,btohqsg

I want to study computer engineering but my amath not good tho will I struggle there,btohqsg
i feel like comp engineering is probs harder than comp sci,btohqsg
Is there a lot of amath,btohqsg
idk im in comp sci n there are mods which are matha,btohqsg
like straight up feels like h2 maths,btohqsg
I don’t mind but I’m not good at it in a sense I understand basics but erm,btohqsg
i feel like whichever u take  as long as ur open minded n willing to learn,btohqsg
u can do well  i know alot of friends in my course that never learnt programming,btohqsg
but we all learn and grow and they r doing quite well,btohqsg
I hope my olvl score can get in first,btohqsg
Is it like quite male dominated,btohqsg
theres quite some jc kids that didnt take h2 computing that came info my course  some willing to learn  some who just keep asking for answers  so yea,btohqsg
it depends on perspective but looking at statistics yes but im a girl so,btohqsg
I thot they say h2 computing useless?,btohqsg
not sure some of the things i learn in UOL does start h2 comp from scratch ah,btohqsg
I do h2 computing so i know i will die in the first week of comsci,btohqsg
its useless in a sense people can learn just from uni  but not useless if u consider that you get to see a perspectice of how computing is,btohqsg
Cant even do linked list fml,btohqsg
haha i was in h2 comp  got a C for A's but i went to sim uol  so not sure if it counts,btohqsg
Me looking at chat be like : 👁️👄👁️,btohqsg
but so far ive gotten A's for all mg mods in sem 1,btohqsg
so i dont think youll die if the uni u go to is more,btohqsg
I always felt q hard to do well in computing unless u started from young tbh,btohqsg
its honestly just how we are taught,btohqsg
cuz h2 comp youre still memorising things,btohqsg
but once ur in uni (once agn from my own sch experience  not sure if its the same) they actually give yoi like reasoning,btohqsg
i mean if u do want to see what i learn i can dm u some things i do,btohqsg
because when u write on paper,btohqsg
but ok la h2 computing is eay more rigid i guess,btohqsg
ok maybe if ur going ntu nus,btohqsg
idk but like for my sch they dont really care they start from basics,btohqsg
at least its not a levels :D,btohqsg
i mean dont follow me im like,btohqsg
Idk why my ankles felt so sore,btohqsg
the worst example of an a level student LOL i graduated tho so,btohqsg
bruh u want the scariest jc for h2 computing,btohqsg
u can see our face drop the moment we see dhs and rv,btohqsg
cuz theirs is really really high standard qn,btohqsg
like its rly rly tough but trains u to see questions more indepth,btohqsg
All i learnt is that i cant do programming and shdnt do comsci,btohqsg
so we like looking at fhen qns,btohqsg
hahaha comp sci in SIM UOL is fun,btohqsg
so i can't really complain anything abt my course,btohqsg
Hahaha no la  my school Collab with DHS before so I got friends there... The teachers are very welcoming and the principal is very supportinggg,btohqsg
Oh ur in sec sxh haha?,btohqsg
How can price be half half,btohqsg
like its expensive compared to local  cheaper compared to priv,btohqsg
Yea i doubt whether i can even afford local so i guess not an option for me,btohqsg
n i rather focuz on only maths n programming compared to focusing on 5 subjects,btohqsg
so i rejected the accepted appeal to retake cuz the uni accepted me,btohqsg
wait who was the person who talked about the part time job for banquets ah,btohqsg

@its_shxnhow did u score so high in Getaway?,btohqsg
Your take home should be 20% of the 10/h,btohqsg
Employer 17% is on top of the 10/h that you're getting,btohqsg
for 10/h  8/h but ur CPF should be getting 3.7/h,btohqsg
HahaMy technique is that you should do turn (recommend do a sharp turn) only when the police car is about 60m away from youYou should keep doing sharp turn only in one direction as much as possibleE.g. First time turn is right side  then subsequent turn should also be right sideUnless there's one police car suddenly in front of you  then you can turn in another directionSo  yeahIt's not so easyThis one need more practiceEnjoy playing the game :),btohqsg

Yes. They haven’t paint it over.,btohqsg
it operated on many buses when it was on SMRT,btohqsg
svc 169 965 969 and many more,btohqsg
then when that bus was shifted to TTS  it operated on svc 853 for quite some time and now svc 969,btohqsg

I just saw this on tiktok n decided to ss n ask yall what is it lmao,btohqsg
When u say that I feel like we didn't go through the same primary and secondary school system,btohqsg
I mean it looks completely different from primary school problem sums and sec sch emaths,btohqsg
not wrong  group theory requires basic discrete math as a prereq,btohqsg
then again so do a lot of math modules,btohqsg
87/90 for median for an exam LOL,btohqsg

sec sch math is easier bcoz we learn algebra to solve pri sch math things,btohqsg

Technically you can after you got your pay but the company may blacklist you if you MIA.,btohqsg
Its inconsiderate and would cause alot of inconvenience,btohqsg
So if you need to leave. Inform them in advance.,btohqsg
Better not toBecause if you suddenly MIA  you can cause many people to do extra work at very last minutes. This can be damn tiring and annoying,btohqsg
And if you get blacklisted  probably might be super hard for you to get another job,btohqsg
If you have no show for work and it will just leave a record in your future work.  And that is one of the  worst thing that can happen other than  getting blacklisted..,btohqsg
don't u do it Qis...if u hate ur job  just inform them IN ADVANCE that u are resigning that job. Don't disappear out of a sudden else they think u sus,btohqsg
Speaking from my own point of view as a boss:Any of my employees no show for 3 times with no valid reason I will just straight fire them.,btohqsg
and like what@Neonpotassiumoxidesaid it's gonna affect ur future carrer and u're gonna have a tough time looking for a job in future,btohqsg
And one more thingBecause of COVID-19 pandemic  a lot of people lost their jobs  and those taxi drivers now very hard to earn money. These groups of people now very hard to feed themselves and their family members.You should appreciate that you have the job. Don't ever do foolish actions  or else you will regret it throughout your whole life,btohqsg
If u wan to focus on study just tell them NICELY and they will understand. Like how I allow my employees to take a year break to study :))) so yeah,btohqsg
she wants to work during this ~ 2 months holidays only,btohqsg
Cuz I rmb she said b4 she Wan go jc,btohqsg
If u wan go jc why work ?,btohqsg
and in the first place@simpfor029you should really have considered whether u really want this job?,btohqsg
YesBut if she get blacklisted  I think her studies may get affected as well (e.g. the school doesn't want her because of irresponsible action),btohqsg
ya lor..that's why people say do part-time only after Os,btohqsg
if she wants to go jc  rn she should be studying her a** out  of it bc Sec 4 they're gonna go very fast,btohqsg
@/everyonewho here has went for EAE?,btohqsg
Me a few years agoAndI passed the eae and I can tell u abt it if uw,btohqsg
Me  a few years agoI failed the EAE  but I can tell you the experience if you want,btohqsg
@simpfor029I hope you better think properly after you have read our answers to your questionIf you do foolish actions and hence unable to get any jobs at all  how are you gonna feed your parents  especially if you're their only child?,btohqsg
Just submit your 2 week notice for resignation or request for break,btohqsg
Y’alls seriously over catastrophising an action without the full story on what’s going on,btohqsg
it's btr to be safe then to be sry,btohqsg
think abt the worst that can be happen first :x,btohqsg
The worst case scenario is likely very far from reality. We do not know the motive for leaving  there could be mismanagement in the workplace,btohqsg
I have some disagreement between my coworker,btohqsg
She want shorter hours while I want shorter days,btohqsg
then maybe the 2 of u js try and balance your workload among urselves?,btohqsg
How will they blacklist me tho,btohqsg
I want long hours and short days,btohqsg
While she want short hours long days,btohqsg
That’s why I want leave without telling them,btohqsg
that's why everything gets messed up,btohqsg
and the issue just gets bigger and bigger like a snowball and no one can resolve it,btohqsg
Like work for the whole day then more rest days,btohqsg
While short hours like work everyday but short hours lor,btohqsg
@simpfor029I don't understand how no. of hours and days that you want cause you to leave without telling themAll you should do is put yourself in their shoes. Imagine that you're the supervisor. If your employee suddenly leave  definitely you'll feel super tired  frustrated and annoyed as you suddenly have to do your employee's tasks while you're actually quite busy with your own tasks alreadyCan you imagine how tiring it is? I can imagine how tiring it is as I had done OT for 9 days and what I had been doing was just only my tasks and I felt super tired already. If a person suddenly had left and my supervisor asked me to do that person's tasks  I could not have gone home for the past 9 days already,btohqsg
I mean they also trouble me abit,btohqsg
They left me alone on a Sunday morning,btohqsg
They think I’m a octopus who have 8 hands,btohqsg
ur whole day I assume its more than 7hrs?,btohqsg
u do know ur company can get fine if mom catch u working more than 7hrs,btohqsg
And I only started this job like on this Tuesday,btohqsg
What is the definition of young person's,btohqsg
u break it  u get fined,btohqsg
Can someone send the link for this page,btohqsg
Ok nvm I not affected haha,btohqsg
u break it  u get fined,btohqsg
and 1 blackmark on ur future carrer,btohqsg
If this happened only on this day  then it would be damn unfair if you just suddenly leaveLike if you suddenly leave  everybody will do extra work for many days until they manage to employ another person(1 day vs. many days  which one more tired?)However  if you're under 16 years old and you have been given to do long hours  by right you should complain to MOMI rather you complain to MOM about your supervisor than just MIAComplain to MOM  you won't get blacklistedSuddenly MIA without informing anybody  likely can get blacklisted,btohqsg
but why work part-time in the first place?,btohqsg
Correct me if any information that I mention is incorrect😅,btohqsg
where do U wanna go? poly? jc? mi?,btohqsg
I just want to be a runway model,btohqsg
they will blacklist since they got ur details n they just leave it as a termination scar,btohqsg
u nvr tell ur mum ur real feeling ?,btohqsg
tell her what uw and not what she want,btohqsg
cuz u can't force someone to do smth,btohqsg
Like if you run away without informing them  they actually still have your details (cuz you're not running away with your details that you gave to them).If let say running away can cause many people to do extra work at very last minute  I think they will start blacklisting youHonestly  I don't know how the blacklist system work  but I think they can make use your information to do soThen  once you get blacklisted  you're in trouble. Even if you're able to apply a new job  you might not be able to get in. Why? Because your new job may have your information from your old job.They may interview and ask you if you get blacklisted or not.So  yeahBetter not to runaway. If runaway and hence get blacklisted  your whole life may be ruined,btohqsg
Is it got contract one? Or dh contract,btohqsg
once u do sth dumb  u be in trouble,btohqsg
Bro go and read ur contract,btohqsg
if u w to be one then dun scar ur work,btohqsg
If u mia they can ask u to pay them the amt of money for the days u mia,btohqsg
So ya u basically go bankrupt,btohqsg
lots of cons if u choose to runaway,btohqsg
Number 2 is that the agency blacklist u for eg recruitfirst will not allow u to take up any more part time job at their agency,btohqsg
which is NEVER a good option,btohqsg
YesJust write a resign letter or whatever that you can inform them that you want to leave,btohqsg
That I want a resignation form,btohqsg
And two weeks notice cos they want to give me shorter hours and longer days instead of longer hours and shorter daysWhen I just joined the job like on Tuesday,btohqsg
Just msg ur boss or agent,btohqsg
Tell em u dun wanna work anymore,btohqsg
so that there won't be a misunderstanding between u and ur boss/agent,btohqsg
say u nid study for O levels and that ur parents don't want you to focus on two things at once,btohqsg
Hi  boss  due to unforseen circumstances  I would like to stop working from _ onwards  please help to arrange accordingly. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.,btohqsg
If they ask u for specific reason,btohqsg
Do I need to mention about the,btohqsg
Just put ur date 2 weeks later,btohqsg

@simpfor029Actually  I have the same issue with youLike you said you want to be a runway model but your mother wants you to study in JC  right?For me  my brother keeps wanting me to study very very well  but I really don't like to study ever since I experienced the study life in poly  especially the COVID-19 came  which made me stress until I kept hitting myselfI realized that I prefer working to studying after I do my internship. And  to be honest  I don't believe that study is everything after I have seen the nature in the world (sorry  those people who think study is quite important  better study properly  don't be like me haha). So  instead of studying  I'm gonna chase the dream  which is to continue working at my company after my internshipSo  I believe that you're able to prove your mother that study is not everything and you're able to prove that your life in your dream is never wrong,btohqsg
And my mother wants me to become a air sterwerdess,btohqsg
Even if I tried making one  it won't taste as good as boost's,btohqsg
That depends on your contract and your employer?,btohqsg
Unless you work at Boost then probably yes.,btohqsg
But Boost taste somewhat diluted eh?,btohqsg
@simpfor029I don't understand why flight attendant needs JC's qualification in order to get flight attendant's jobMy sister graduated from NYP  but she still managed to become a flight attendantAnd I don't think she should force you to become a flight attendant  especially now it's COVID-19 pandemic.A mother should think that earn money is important  but health and safety is more important. Am I right? @/everyone,btohqsg
For the flavor I always drink,btohqsg
Idk sia why she want me go jc so badly,btohqsg
Like she don’t even care if it’s Yishun,btohqsg
But I hate flight attendant tho,btohqsg
And if you go to JC  you won't get any chance to try out internship,btohqsg
But if you Willing to mug a lot and have tuition good,btohqsg
The pw and Econs’s dept v bad   the sch culture v bad,btohqsg
Is it possible to take h2 science but h1 math in jc?,btohqsg
There are only bad students (me),btohqsg
Am waiting for a plot twist for this one,btohqsg
My friend take h2 physics and h1 maths,btohqsg
Eh that's what I want too haha,btohqsg
No plot twists. I bad students and I bbfa,btohqsg
All the best everyone for As tomorrow!,btohqsg
But no offence its kinda weird haha,btohqsg
U use alot of maths inside so i think its recommended to take it with h2 maths not too sure thou,btohqsg
Later ur physique change n u become main character of every anime,btohqsg
I dont sit beside the window,btohqsg
I will try and ask my friend,btohqsg
Btw anyone going to singapore fintech festival for the cert lol,btohqsg
Is ok side character still part of the main cast,btohqsg
Why dw take h2 math? Scared ah?,btohqsg
I understand. Without A math H2 math is damn tough,btohqsg
But still can make it right?,btohqsg
No I don't have a strong emath foundation,btohqsg
The thing is For those who take A math,btohqsg
Will also find H2 math a struggle.,btohqsg
Must i do damn well for H2 math to do H3 math,btohqsg
If u can manage h2 math then why not.,btohqsg
U must do well for all subjects,btohqsg
Then do you know the difference H1 math and H2 math@Onetrickcore,btohqsg
For h1 and h2It is divided into 2 section.Pure math and stats.,btohqsg
Stats for h1 and h2 is the similar.,btohqsg
But h1 math pure math is like 20 to 30 % of A math syllabus,btohqsg
And for h1 math u are only will be seating for 1 paper.,btohqsg
And h2 math will have to sit for 2 paper. Which is 3 hours each also,btohqsg
So h1 math will only have paper 1,btohqsg
what course uw go in uni@Onetrickcorejust curious,btohqsg
The main difference isH1 mathPure math is 40%Stats 60%WhereasH2 mathPure math is 70%Stats 30%,btohqsg
Something related to business or accounting,btohqsg
Then h1 is suitable for you alr.,btohqsg
udw go mi -? they got commerce stream,btohqsg
Idk leh I think like JC btr?,btohqsg
Because h1 math is more on stats.,btohqsg
Ik alot ppl go mi then go biz,btohqsg
Idk why other JCs don’t offer it,btohqsg
Location wise mi abit far also tho,btohqsg
Cause I stay nearer to east side,btohqsg
Which mob  the anime mob or mob mob,btohqsg
Ik q alot ppl east side go mi,btohqsg
Local uni econs no need H2 math as prerequisite. But still if you have a uni course in mind  make sure you meet the prerequisites for the course. Not having H2 math eliminates most STEM-related courses,btohqsg
I didn’t realise I disliked economics so much until I actually studied it,btohqsg
Doesnt international business have alot of econs?,btohqsg
We don’t specialise in that content until year 2,btohqsg
But the econs module that I studied so far was soooo dry,btohqsg
Even though the lecturer was lit,btohqsg
R u gonna go for business admin degree?,btohqsg
I kinda realised I liked computer science,btohqsg
So I’m planning to self study it,btohqsg
Maybe take H2 math privately or something,btohqsg
Lol im the complete opposite. I realised i hate coding and prefer business,btohqsg
Yea exactly i am a mob,btohqsg
It’s the product that you create with it,btohqsg
That makes you love the process,btohqsg
Idk i think i just not suited for it,btohqsg
Eh but computer courses are full of nerds though,btohqsg
I do linked list i start vomitting blood,btohqsg
Which would be a disaster in uni,btohqsg
Then all the data encapsulation and polymorphism shit come out i cry even more,btohqsg
Can code ur own virtual gf loo,btohqsg
I haven’t learned polymorphism so I can’t reallt comment,btohqsg
Idk ah but at least the pay in comsci is good?,btohqsg
Pay in redmart was also good for part time,btohqsg
Cant wait for ns. Can tell im gonna hate the pay and the job,btohqsg
Yea who doesnt want to serve the nation while ur juniors become ur seniors,btohqsg
Can't wait to get out of NS,btohqsg
Only left with a few days  so would be entering uni next year :/,btohqsg
gonna go cs for the starting pay vroom vroom,btohqsg
ooh im in CS n its v fun,btohqsg
Is it true that food that are meant to be deep fried are always boiled? Like French fries,btohqsg
I have to be honest  I dont even think they are called french fries,btohqsg
Serving ns and doing reservist is a privelege/s,btohqsg
And honestly  I think it is okay lah but kinda not like kfc standard,btohqsg
But I would say most likely most of them are not fried,btohqsg
But they do have ice cream  but is those mini mart kind of icecream,btohqsg
Btw are there difference in prospects between local and private unis?,btohqsg
I would say local has more job prospects  but if you went to private  will also have lah just lesser,btohqsg
But would recommend doing part time jobs or internships to boost resume,btohqsg
thats a lot of ppl suddenly join,btohqsg
Everywhere u go is stressful. Welcome to SG,btohqsg
Omg haha just watched this last night,btohqsg
Good luck to all poa ginas later on,btohqsg
I fucked up paper 1 alr,btohqsg
Uncle think Victor Davis is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Uncle think ##Kegois spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
may all your bank recons/statement of financial position tally,btohqsg
Honestly i shld hope everyone does bad and I do well,btohqsg
Thats the smart move but not the wise one,btohqsg
