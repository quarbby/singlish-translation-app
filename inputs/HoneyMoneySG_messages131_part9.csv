Hi  anyone has received the interest for hsbc ega promotion for the month of jun/jul ?,btohqsg
Hi  Can any expert advise if I really spend $1000 a month using citi rewards card and every thing I spend offline with amaze card.  Will I be able to redeem any free flight to anywhere after a year?,btohqsg
4000 miles a month x 12https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQ_AwdChart.pdf,btohqsg
Assuming the amaze + Citi promo never get nerfed and no devaluations  yes.1k x 4mpd x 12 months = 48k milesMore than enough for round trip Taiwan on economy saver.If you want business then only regional at most...,btohqsg
Errrr I‚Äôm a bit confused.  Isn‚Äôt using amaze card n all online purchases get 10x citi points? So should get 10k citi points a month? How do we convert to the sia miles? What‚Äôs the calculation?,btohqsg
Paiseh har maths not so good‚Ä¶.. hehehe,btohqsg
1 mile = 2.5 Citi thank you points.,btohqsg
Convert to miles can do by app. 25000 points for 10000 kf miles. Search abit online can find‚Ä¶,btohqsg
OIC.  Thank u thank u.   Think I roughly get it Liao,btohqsg
Aiyo wasted so many years never knew miles collection is so good leh.   Hahhaha,btohqsg
It is no free. You still exchange the possible for being able to get cashback to getting miles.,btohqsg
You are letting go of 5% cashback for 4mpd.,btohqsg
But cash back won‚Äôt get so much as price of air ticket right?,btohqsg
They just illustrating a point that it‚Äôs not free cause you can get cashback if u use a cashback card,btohqsg
Erhm you spend 12k a year  5% cashback is 600 and it's enough to get an economy flight to Taiwan too. üòÅ,btohqsg
That's the calculation that has to be done,btohqsg
Not everything. There are exclusions clauses. Some are excluded. It is stated in the TnC.,btohqsg
I usually spend nearly 2 k a month I also never get cash back of 600 a yr leh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ in that stupid everyday card.  Hahhahah,btohqsg
If u spend 2k a month maybe look at UOB VS instead,btohqsg
Cashback also needs optimization. Spend 2k a month on one single miles card wont maximize miles earned as well.,btohqsg
Uob visa signature. If you want to try miles game  can tell us what are ur 2k spend?,btohqsg
Citi rewards can only up to 1k spend right to max out the 10x rewards,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why experts spend 1k each on citi rewards and DBS lady‚Äôs card to max out the earnings‚Ä¶. Right?,btohqsg
Sir really depends on your spending habits üòÇ,btohqsg
You get the ideas. But different ppl will have different set of cards based on their needs.,btohqsg
Anyway which card do u experts link yr giro for utilities n hp bills to??? To max the miles earn,btohqsg
If GIRO HSBC EGA. Can search up honey money chat on this  many mentionsNot miles though.,btohqsg
ya no good miles card for utilities as far as i can recall. HP bill can be paid by citirewards + amaze,btohqsg
Giro credit card won‚Äôt score extra points is it ?,btohqsg
Hi guys I edited cdg zig payment method from pay on board to CC wwmc when on board in the zig app. When I checked in DBS app payment mode is recurring instead of online.This means I won't get the bonus miles right?,btohqsg
transaction posted? if not may change to online after posted,btohqsg
Morning! Does anyone know how to check the monthly spend for OCBC credit card in the new OCBC app?,btohqsg
