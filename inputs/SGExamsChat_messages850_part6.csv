idk if i shld take a math privately and do tuition & mug much harder so i can get into a better JC,btohqsg
whats the rate for one session,btohqsg
ill look into that  not bad price ‚ÄºÔ∏è,btohqsg
I rmb they had like surge pricing when i went during psle,btohqsg
i forgot which one was the 600$ i think its the learning lab a and e math,btohqsg
if u can go into JC  don't bother retake O lvl,btohqsg
i got screwed over with 3 B3s bruh,btohqsg
wah so long since I last came this grp,btohqsg
YIJC h2 math pre req is a2 e math tho ü•≤ü•≤  and i EAEed successfully to poly (i regret my course) so i appealing to JC,btohqsg
didnt take a maths in sch,btohqsg
Actually more important question is What you want to progress in your career in life,btohqsg
and what's the suitable / alternative pathway to reach there.,btohqsg
not everything must die die come out from school with a Cert / Degree.,btohqsg
what course? Poly is also ok,btohqsg
i rlly want a chemistry degree  ik my poly course can make it there but GPA being cumulative is like damn.. i can barely fuck up,btohqsg
I mean jc oso need keep up,btohqsg
it would be the same for JC,btohqsg
are the Chemical Job Prospects that good in Singapore? ü§£You really like doing Organic Chemistry?,btohqsg
ok if you got B3 for E Maths and didn't take A Maths  the chances of doing well for H2 Maths is much lower,btohqsg
i mean i dont find any other subjects interesting so üòá..üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
while I have seen it achieved before  it's going to be an uphill battle,btohqsg
yeah i have that feeling  tbf i didnt study at all for sec 2 and 3 and early sec 4..so i hope if i lock in i can do it üò≠ hardest part wld be staying disciplined,btohqsg
I taught part time since 2002 after my A lvl  and full time since 2012I honestly think H2 Maths will take up a lot of your time.To take a chem degree  you would want 2 H2 sciences tooThis is a killer combo if you also didn't do too well for O lvl science,btohqsg
im still gonna take poly year 1 since i got in so üôèüôè get a taste of poly while retaking Os,btohqsg
i think my sci wld be ok..hopefully..,btohqsg
"most likely would be much ""Chiller"" compared to A-Levels.",btohqsg
mainly trying to grind math since i did badly for math since pri sch üò≠üò≠üôèüôè,btohqsg
A1 for pure sciences may not even be enough for H2 sciences.,btohqsg
Dont chill umtil ur gpa can be bus fare,btohqsg
I mean if you can hire S$600/month for tuition.,btohqsg
HAHAHHAHAHA need to have enough to buy chicken rice,btohqsg
might as well just go online tuition for IGCSE Level Maths and Add Maths. lol,btohqsg
yuhh i have a part time job rn  hopefully can cover tuition fees,btohqsg
some even are self paced recorded courses,btohqsg
If i get off in 1 stop i think im chill,btohqsg
i D7 my o level maths  went to poly. one mod on maths in 3 yrs.D7 equivalent on that mod too,btohqsg
You can look for jc students who want to do some tutoring on the side after a levels. I know there are a lot  I was doing it too before uni started,btohqsg
They tend to charge cheaper fees,btohqsg
ooooooooo okey okey ill check that out,btohqsg
most likely you won't use that mod's maths in your life anytime soon lol,btohqsg
I think you have better chances going through poly to attempt uniBecause JC requires pure dedication and very strong conceptual knowledge.,btohqsg
bad idea. Syllabus changes may not be followed.,btohqsg
yea nope  it was like partial A levels kind of maths,btohqsg
This yr J2 new H2 Maths syllabusJ1 new H2 sciences syllabus,btohqsg
