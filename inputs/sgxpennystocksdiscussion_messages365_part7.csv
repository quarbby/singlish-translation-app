I just feel its undervalued. The cagr for PPE is 7.8 per cent until 2025  now w Biden's Buy American policy also I think MT USA can benefit a lot.,btohqsg
Plus if talking about economics  then Americans can charge them a higher price premium. Now w geopolitical tensions btwn Aus and China  MT can also leverage on this and expand their market share in Aus,btohqsg
Just hope MT can manage to get a few more govts in EU and other Western countries as ntl stockpiling partner given how they've been ravaged by the coronavirus.,btohqsg
In a way  US debt is too large so in order to cover the interest  they have to raise corporate tax but by doing so also create another new set of problem (muted capital inflow  company outsourcing jobs etc or moved outside of US)  I think this proposal will failed.,btohqsg
