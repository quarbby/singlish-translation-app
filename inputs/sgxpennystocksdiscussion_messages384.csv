I gg start job hunting alr but to be honest I don't really have my hopes up too high,btohqsg
Business is honestly the most useless major I feel.........,btohqsg
Get a good internship that‚Äôs key,btohqsg
Business can work in fund management  and banks and earn big bucks by being moneymaker and punish retailers,btohqsg
So this holidays I no intern. So I decided to work on what I'm deficient at. Languages (Chinese  French)  software like Tableau etc,btohqsg
I got no interest in finance unfortunately,btohqsg
Life is short. I think I want to go japan teach english,btohqsg
Actually you should intern . It‚Äôs good that you are learning other stuffs  but leave it to your free time or while hunting for job,btohqsg
I was thinking of taking my licence this holidays. Since I alr got military licence shld be okay to pass,btohqsg
I tried applying but all didn't get back... And some I just don't qualify because I dont have the skills. In poly I did aviation but of course now all up lorry no one hiring in the industry...,btohqsg
Not getting an intern I don't think is the end of the world bah... Cos I did do one in poly and last semester I worked part time during the sem too. So my CV luckily isn't empty.,btohqsg
Aviation will have good prospects in future.,btohqsg
Internship don‚Äôt need relevant skill one,btohqsg
But I feel I lack skills more than work experience at this point. That's why I'm not too hard up on not doing intern. Cos so many positions when I was in the process of applying  I just didn't qualify cos I don't know some software etc,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a matter of Heng suay and finding a hirer that need someone (anyone!) so don‚Äôt give up,btohqsg
U r a very positive young lad.. If u manage to know some jpmm please intro to fellow bbfa,btohqsg

Honestly sometimes I also dk what I doing w my life. My friends all structured one.Aim for XYZ job  so they do ABC intern during semester by taking leave of absence  then DEF intern during summer holidays etc etc. Rinse and repeat.I just happy go lucky doing things that I like and at my own pace. If cannot find job then so be it. I make my own job/coy or deliver grabfood lor.Its very Singaporean right. Grad from uni w good honours > marry uni sweetheart > BTO > married > have kids > work until 60 at some dead job wanting to quit  complain about salary about boss about work > Withdraw CPF > DieI cannot even fulfil the first step... I also no need worry about kids or wife cos I BBFA destined. My expenses now only $150 max including transport and food. Maybe by the time I work it'll be $300 excluding pocket money to parents. I don't need much to survive  maybe that's why I very unambitious lor...,btohqsg
