Don’t mind me if I ask a lot beginner questions HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Used car might be better for you for sure since you are jumping in for the first time so if you do decide you don't want to stay on anymore. Can sell in a while and not take a huge depreciation hit like that on new cars,btohqsg
Not the main purpose lah  wanna earn money going to place that I wanna go  at the same time fetch anyone to earn the money!,btohqsg
However it is also luck based because if you end up with a bad unit  you might have a bad first experience,btohqsg
first car best is to get a used old conti  u get to learn parts of car u NVR heard of in your life real fast.,btohqsg
I probably going for a used conti for a next car  most probably like a Audi,btohqsg
good choice... if you dun want to learn anything about car then get a Tesla...😛,btohqsg
also don't be too alarmed with what people say about contis and reliability,btohqsg
if you find a good unit and have done a thorough inspection to check for basic known issues  you are going to have a smooth time,btohqsg
and many do confuse higher maintenance cost to be a sign of bad reliability which is not the case,btohqsg
All cars have their own set of problems  just that some cost more to fix due to labour costs or parts that are slightly more expensive!,btohqsg
