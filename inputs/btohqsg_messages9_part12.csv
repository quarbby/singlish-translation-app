Anyone know if there is any upcoming BTO in punggol??,btohqsg
no one knows but there are still many plots of land,btohqsg
thanks. do you happen to know  why is the gable end  just takes up a fraction of the wall but not the whole wall? I tried to google but can't find anything,btohqsg
Gable end wallsFound in corner HDB units  these are walls with short awnings on the exterior to protect your home from sun and heat. It's like sunglasses but for the walls.,btohqsg
Usually after book flat can source for ID alr ? Because the HDB people did say some applications MIGHT not be approved or something.,btohqsg
What if i alr paid ID deposit then for some reason cannot buy flat? üòÇ my eligibility is ok but i just scared in case,btohqsg
Maybe pay your hdb downpayment before ID deposit haha,btohqsg
This year end . My flat will be completed on sept .,btohqsg
are the SBF flats already TOP or it‚Äôs one of those that are under construction?,btohqsg
Scared ID cant hold the price quoted now for that long,btohqsg
I see. you should probably wait till flat TOP and then you can start to search for ID,btohqsg
Under construction but the max dpd date is nov,btohqsg
as long as you have yet to pay anything then that‚Äôs fine. you still have plenty of time to look around,btohqsg
Maybe i go meet the id see how long he can hold the price for üòÇ nego nego abit,btohqsg
yeah  that‚Äôs a good idea but how does he price it? does he say something likeif you don‚Äôt take the package from me now  then the prices might be more expensive if you decide to take the same one a few months laterkind of thing?,btohqsg
Havent met him yet. But believe mostly all ids would say that,btohqsg
I placed deposit with my ID in March as I thought I can collect keys in June,btohqsg
he assured me the price is locked in,btohqsg
If not casetrusted/ hdb registered does it mean not safe to go for the id?,btohqsg
Better don't sign up with such firm,btohqsg
LOL Im infront of the shop alr,btohqsg
Or at least Google for their firms to read the reviews,btohqsg
Not reliable too those negative ones can be written by their rivals too,btohqsg
They just opened on jan this year,btohqsg
Hi anyone know the progression for boon lay glade?,btohqsg

Is it advisable to save the resale grant for next bto purchase?,btohqsg
Or should i just take hdb loan with resale grant and then convert to bank loan and topping up cpf with cash to avoid the cpf accrued interest rate.,btohqsg
