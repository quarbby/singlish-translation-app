Anyone has experience in investing in syfe cash flexi ?,btohqsg
each lot of miles in your krisflyer account is tracked separately. Miles expiring first will be used first.,btohqsg
You can sign up for 2 cc which gives you 1+1. Then you can use both PPs at the same time by utilising 4 visits to bring yourself + 2 companions in.Alternatively  can sign up for BOC VI card that allows all 4 visits to be used all at once. But it's under Premier Lounges  so meaning only SATS lounges in SIN iirc.,btohqsg
This will be a real turn off for those who play musical chair every mth! Even same name different bank transfer also kenna? This doesn't make sense! Their SRF should exclude this!!! Otherwise  someone pls proof to me how can someone get scammed by doing transfers into one's own accounts? üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if payment for clubmed counts as travel spend for lady solitaire card?,btohqsg
Seems like I didnt get the 6mpd worth of uni points after spending on it even though I chose travel as one of the categories,btohqsg
Did you check the mcc code for clubmed? If UOB exclude then obviously it is not a travel mcc code. Or the shop within clubmed?,btohqsg

Last Saturday I applied for a savings account with Sing Investment and Finance using their app.Until now they r still processing my application.Come on it's just a savings account and they're taking more than 1 week to process?,btohqsg
wah same  I apply last Friday  still waiting for account approval,btohqsg
Any into SG Bonds? Like to know how is it,btohqsg
I kena this when I move 5k and 7+k in Nov  fraud team call me in around 30mins  and unlock in 10mins,btohqsg
for SCB ah? this is the first time i kenna leh.. sigh,btohqsg
I made similar on 31 Jan and 1 Feb but was ok  dunno what‚Äôs their trigger,btohqsg
they refused to say even though i asked ... and even requested to put my account on 'relaxed mode' and willing to release them of liabilities,btohqsg
to be very blunt... i believe I will not benefit at all from the latest stupid anti-scam measures. it only serves to inconvenience me,btohqsg
all these safeguards feel like inconveniences until they save you your life‚Äôs savings one day. just count your blessings and don‚Äôt assume it will never happen to you,btohqsg
yeah this is the official message from government....but i feel it actually makes people less vigilant. Now they think they can don't care since onus is on the bank to protect them.,btohqsg
i guess they figured since people aren‚Äôt doing their part  they need stronger measures otherwise they will say the bank dw help them when they kena scammed,btohqsg
Exactly. Plus  moving out 200k should not be as easy as moving 2k. Even just one additional phone call check would be worth the hassle for significantly more security.,btohqsg
they didn't factor in people who legitimately need to move money around frequently and fully aware of the risks involved.,btohqsg
True. Then it should be free to opt out of such security measures,btohqsg
yes that was what i offered to the Anti Fraud officer who called in.. he said not possible...,btohqsg
Oh I pay using AXS Mobile - NTUC Income Insurance,btohqsg
The other recent irritant that tightened is Interest Bearing Balances.Last time  over $120k annual income  nobody bothers. Recently  got DPs of banks clamping down even if you earn above $120k annual income and you have Interest Bearing Balances above your 12 months Income ON RECORD with them.They don't even bother to find out why customer has the Interest Bearing Balances before they reduce your limit.So the strategy of taking cheap Balance Transfers to put into High Yield Savings Accounts is very dangerous now.,btohqsg
"I just tried to pay for DBS credit card Bill on AXS e-station using the Chocolate Visa. The error message is ""Your payment card is not accepted. Please try again or use another card"". I have reported the issue to Chocolate via their WhatsApp",btohqsg
Happy Saturday all!With the ongoing promotion for the Chocolate Finance Card and Hey Max  I‚Äôd love to get your thoughts on whether my current card setup is optimal for my monthly spending. Right now  I‚Äôm using:1. GE OCBC ‚Äì For GE premiums (~$1.4K)2. SCB Smart ‚Äì For daily transport and Ya Kun (~$120) which I'm intending to apply for the Maybank f&f in April.3. Citibank Cashback+ ‚Äì For all other spending (~$1K)I don‚Äôt spend a lot in general  so I‚Äôm wondering if I should stick with these cards  or consider switching any of them to the Chocolate Finance Card. Would it offer better rewards or cashback for my spending pattern?Appreciate any advice! Thanks in advance üôèüèº,btohqsg
it is not supported to pay cc bill.,btohqsg
There is no way bank A will know bank B account beneficiary owner is u. Yes there is portion to put beneficiary name(u can actually write nonsense here) but only the bank account number matters for transfers,btohqsg
There is a saying: Do not help people who don't want to be helped. We can't clap with just one hand  and people have the right to their own money.If she wants to be stubborn and give her money away  that is her choice. The only way she can learn from her mistake is to experience it for herself - although it's going to be a very costly one üôÇ,btohqsg
Chocolate Card cannot pay for credit card bill.,btohqsg
For (1)  can consider Chocolate card (2mmpd capped at 1k  equivalent to 3.6% cashback) or GIRO with HSBC (1% cashback),btohqsg
Your GE premium $1.4K  is it monthly or yearly premium?,btohqsg
Hello Community Anyone know a broadband provider without 12x or 24x commitment ? I am thinking to get something home for 3 months   any recommendations ?,btohqsg
A while ago there was a discussion on advance payment for income tax. I think someone made a comment you can do a setting yourself in iras to retain advance payments. May I know where to do this? I explored iras website cannot find it. I am currently using the manual method of using mailbox to message iras officer to manually retain my advance payments. Thanks.,btohqsg
But only can spend at Japan right? Mean good only if u keep going Japan?,btohqsg
Oh ya  you are absolutely right on this point! The banks don't share their clients info so they won't know you are transferring to yourself!,btohqsg
Hmm you may be right.Bank A won't know Bank B's actual beneficiary (you indeed can put nonsense).BUT Bank B will know Bank A's account name.When you FAST from Bank A to Bank B  Bank B entry will have the account sender's name.So whenever possible  I still try to do first party (same name to same name transfers) to avoid the receiving bank asking questions. However  this doesn't solve the issue at hand which is Bank A blocking the transfer to Bank B! (NO SOLUTION!!!!),btohqsg
Meaning it utilized further visits to offset if bringing more people?,btohqsg
Ya. Dbs vantage pp doesn't restrict how many guests you can bring in 1 visit,btohqsg
Sidetrack a bit  anyone knows when SCB Manhattan Card expires (since Manhattan card no longer being offer)  what the bank will replace to you?,btohqsg
Monthly premiums. My FA shared that for monthly payments  premiums are 3% more  hence  the ocbc card charges 1% processing fee with zero interest  so I'll still save 2%.,btohqsg
the bank still send replacement card upon card expiry,btohqsg
go branch to personally transfer lo. That one confirm no problem üòÇ,btohqsg
After all the nonsense  she still went back to make a police report. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
