But yes tough to buy and resell,btohqsg
Most of it Im just buying and keeping,btohqsg
Sometimes keep alr won't touch for months until new cars come in,btohqsg
then how come some schools have better facilities than other schools?,btohqsg
some independent  some govt aided schools some idk,btohqsg
some schools receive more money from govt than others,btohqsg
I rmb there was a discussion back and many people realise my neighbourhood sec school got better funding from the govt than some elite schools,btohqsg
surely theres a difference in learning resources?,btohqsg
Bro how are yâ€™all still yapping,btohqsg
You can look at the balance sheet and financial statement of certain schools,btohqsg
ya maybe sponsoring church for christian schools,btohqsg
how the school decides to use the funds is a separate matter but the base level funds is more or less the same,btohqsg
but there's extra funds coming from donations etc,btohqsg
they have literal government politicians as their alumni,btohqsg
no way its going to be the same,btohqsg
some schools have a - closing balance,btohqsg
ya this one is govt+ alumni,btohqsg
oh i already know this. nyjc used to be a mid tier jc  now near to raffles and hwachongÊ¼s calibre,btohqsg
anderson jc used to be pro af  but after the merger  dropped significantly,btohqsg
Example dhs alot of benches donated by alumni  the confucius statue also donated by alumni,btohqsg
Every sch gets enough money from government to have the basic facilities required for a decent sch experience,btohqsg
But all the extra fancy stuffs is either from alumni donations or like sch own funding,btohqsg
meanwhile YI removing ccas bc no funding,btohqsg
how so? besides extremely dogshit 90rp rate,btohqsg
that was for that yr only,btohqsg
Ya la I think by now should have the 2022 ver or 2023 liao,btohqsg
I mean u gotta distinguish between independent schools and government schools,btohqsg
RI needs to publish a financial statement cuz they are independent,btohqsg
govt stopped funding ite and in2015-2016and nie in2011-2012  another entity took over,btohqsg
Which means 300 dollars per month,btohqsg
Or smth idk the price liao,btohqsg
dhs built shelter and shutdown ccas too,btohqsg
but tbf the ccas they shutdown is really those that few ppl joined,btohqsg
Again government schools need to rely on MOE for budget,btohqsg
like maybe 2 or 3 ppl continue the cca from jh to sh that kind,btohqsg
my sch raised funds for over 6 yrs by we can reno current campus,btohqsg
most pay 100+ bc of ESIS,btohqsg
ok lah at least not so bad,btohqsg
mm well we always is a broke ass sch,btohqsg
If you add in bursary  many ppl pay only 15bucks,btohqsg
At least thats how it was 10 yrs ago,btohqsg
Ooops  now u know how old I am,btohqsg
There is a scholarship for independent schools for the top % of the psle cohort,btohqsg
my friend interning as it support there,btohqsg
