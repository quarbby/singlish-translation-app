Hmm I wonder why they can’t filter out the people of the “targeted” races and do a ranking separately for them,btohqsg
why the fuck does elite sch matter,btohqsg
but in the comments i saw that the OP thought that elite schools have stricter rules,btohqsg
lol this topic reminds me of my brother’s GP essay,btohqsg
Finally and most compelling would be how technology entrenches systemic discrimination against the poor  such that is even goes unnoticed. This is due to the fact that technology is increasingly being used to replace subjective human judgements and evaluations with more “objective ones”  such as the use of algorithms in all areas of society. An interesting case study would be of the “Street Bump” mobile application developed by Boston’s government. The application would send data to the government about potholes in roads by using phones’ accelerometer to detect worn-down roads. While good intentioned  the poorer regions of Boston were eventually totally excluded from essential road repairs  simply because the people living there did not have phones needed to send data to the government—as a result  poorer neighbourhoods were completely overlooked because of technology. Another example would be of the algorithmic sentencing tools now employed in the legal systems of countries. These tools determine whether the accused in court should be granted bail or go to prison  supposedly absolving judges from making this difficult decision. However  since these tools often operate on past databases rife with historical precedents for discrimination against the poor  they often suggest that the poor have to pay higher bails if they want to avoid internment  or worse still  that they do not even get the chance to pay bail. Consequently  criminal offenders from society’s less-privileged demographics are often denied the chance to pay bail  resulting in the crippling state of being in jail where they cannot even earn an income for their families and where they are forever stigmatised with the condition of “being a prisoner”. Due to the way technology has the immense power to make devastating life changing decision for the poor due to past historical prejudice against them  the poor evidently suffer from the imposition of technology over their lives.,btohqsg
you know has more stricter rules  bmtc schools,btohqsg
Most of my sch hols got shit alrd.....,btohqsg

But it does not hv anything got to do w elite or non-elite,btohqsg

not all lying is gaslighting what,btohqsg
I am21/22/23/24years old and I have a 4.92/4.93/4.96 GPA from nus cs with 2/3/4/5 kids,btohqsg
it took minutes to send that message,btohqsg
"brought up cus during mock oral sum1 called one of the cher ""fatty""  the cher confront him about and ofc he said wasnt him. with the cher saying he was trying to gaslight her.",btohqsg
idk just randomly thought abt it,btohqsg
oh she wasnt agitated or anything lah,btohqsg
ig most of the chers used to it lol,btohqsg
"lol when i wanna fall out because my legs pain  my sgt says ""your legs not pain   it's just your imagination""",btohqsg
Is mechanical engineering rlly that stressful,btohqsg
i rather do that than rot away in NS,btohqsg
me who just chose NTU for the aerospace eng degree:,btohqsg
maybe I accidentally reach the top once,btohqsg
but i definitely won't do it consistently,btohqsg
I'd rather enjoy doing my course than to be pressured to excel in it,btohqsg
"Sentosa Sensoryscape  a 350m linkway designed to be a ""phygital"" celebration of the senses  is opening on March 14. What to look out for:https://str.sg/3xXLJ",btohqsg
i would rather use math to solve math,btohqsg
so did you chat gpt it or smth,btohqsg
tbh this one is the first qns that i did not resort to chatgpt first  so it is an accomplishment i guess...but ya i ended up using chatgpt to find my coding error,btohqsg
good job tho. do yall use python or?,btohqsg
turn out it is just (y t) instead of y(t) t lmao,btohqsg
oh wait it has to be python bc np.linspace,btohqsg
i did not attend lab this week coz i had midterms today and i dw risk my core,btohqsg
math using computational methods is just a diff idea bc you're typically doing it numerically,btohqsg
one of our project qns  the prof wrote there that we can choose to solve it through math too lmao,btohqsg
that uh kinda defeats the purpose but ok...,btohqsg
accepting cca treasurer is actually the worst every decision i had made,btohqsg
x + y + z = constant those kind (this one is linear bc all the variables are degree 1),btohqsg
i had a horrible time lmao and it does not help that the stupid ppm (qm sort of) decides to go MIA  so i ended up doing the liasing with company + chasing for invoice + submitting the invoice all by myself,btohqsg
treasurer is the worst role ever,btohqsg
i was forced to run coz no one applied and the exco was like 'we find u are the best fit of all the candidates',btohqsg
it is the worst role coz most saikang and so underrated,btohqsg
you should have turned it down man,btohqsg
and bruh i was forced to exceed budget lmao coz the percussion section leader (aka my senior) insisted on getting the shimianluo,btohqsg
i had to phone the easton every single day,btohqsg
what OS is it on rn,btohqsg
coz the stupid ppm went mia,btohqsg
then some section leader suddenly came to me and ask me what is happening to my request,btohqsg
oh and another cause of the exceed budget was suona lmao...,btohqsg
and the staff alr nice enough to sponsor the timpani repair,btohqsg
this ridiculous perc section leader just demanding everything during my term,btohqsg
yea we need at least 3 quotation,btohqsg
calling easton everyday to rush the shimianluo is not fun,btohqsg
i remembered it caused a lot of drama coz the perc section leader went to ask the conductor to get us to get the shimianluo,btohqsg
coz the conductor previously told us the shimianluo was fine...,btohqsg
i nearly died during my term,btohqsg
exco supposed to be 10 people  ours 7 coz only 9 applied and then 2 decided to ditch us,btohqsg
YT u have to do AGM?,btohqsg
interpreting financial report is so not it,btohqsg
idk why the (-) means income (+) means spending,btohqsg

i mean it's not your obligation to take it,btohqsg
got a lot of ppl suffer right,btohqsg
but hor  you commenting on the degree  or the work life?,btohqsg
im stucked at a coding step but chatgpt seem to not be able to solve the problem,btohqsg
supposed to get these but idk why i keep getting 2 identical graphs side by side,btohqsg
u mean for studies or for work,btohqsg
uni  I in the process of applying,btohqsg
unless u those kind that love solve maths eqns for fun,btohqsg
or look at structure and think of the different type of loads being applied to it,btohqsg
Fml idk why I feel too attached to Loh kean yew game that every time he lose  I feel mood down,btohqsg
Wdym engineering damn painful when u hvnt started uni,btohqsg
It js sounds scary  my a lvl u js pass phy and math only,btohqsg
I saw my friend’s notes  seem like have a lot of math involved (but that is computer engineering),btohqsg
If you just pass physics and math and youre proceeding on to do engineering in uni.... do buck up your phy and math fr,btohqsg
Guys just a qn  before EJC was established  where do IP students from schools like Cat High/SNGS/SCGS go to for JC?,btohqsg
i know most SCGS would proceed on to HCI,btohqsg
So they get to choose any JC they want or is it based off their Y4 results ( so basically mini o level ),btohqsg
it should be just... O level?,btohqsg
But IP don’t take o lvl what,btohqsg
No all ip schools are tag to a Jc  I think those 3 schools have recently added ip tracks and that is where EJC came about,btohqsg
eh wait I read the question wrongly  then I did a quick search  seems like kiasuparents may have the answer,btohqsg
Hmm yeah it seems that in 2013 they introduced ejc and Ip track simultaneously  but then wasn’t ejc like a 10+ COP sch ? Wldnt that cause a lot of dispute considering SNGS Cat high SCGS PSLE cop is 250+ for IP?,btohqsg
oh cheh i found the answer,btohqsg
EJC is around 7 I believe,btohqsg
MOE already had EJC in mind when SCGS Cat High SNGS started IP,btohqsg
I did not know ip only came about during my p6 era,btohqsg
Is anyone here an expert on vintage playing cards?,btohqsg
But in 2018 it was 10/11 for Sci/Arts,btohqsg
That was the year where all the cop (or most) changed due to the merger of some jcs,btohqsg
But I think it went back down,btohqsg
Hm yeha in 2017 for sci it was 9 then in2018/2019is was 10/9 and in 2020 it became 7,btohqsg
Still though don’t you feel that COP will definitely cause parents to feel mad,btohqsg
Tbh EJC is the newest (?) Jc and cop is beyond the government’s control  it does take time for things to settle,btohqsg
And I assume most wun apply to EJC knowing it houses 3 IP schools  which explains the COP as well,btohqsg
Most other jcs only houses 1-2,btohqsg
My rp only confirm eligible for the last course,btohqsg
But I js apply for those that are like higher,btohqsg
Ntu actually has a badminton mod,btohqsg
Indeed when SCGS  CHS and SNGS received their first batch of IP students  it was already known that those students would be entering the same JC. It was termed “government JC” at that point because the JC name was not decided yet,btohqsg
If the mix of student background is of concern  a more objective assessment is to look at ratio of number of IP students vs number JAE students and not simply the number of schools feeding the JC?,btohqsg
every time Axelsen lose  I feel sad,btohqsg
i heard for ri/rg still need,btohqsg
Anyone knows what machine is this,btohqsg
This is the latest i hv ever woken up lol,btohqsg

I looked at this dude from my batch that got student of the yr…OMG his freaking linked in,btohqsg
But jc u still schooling  linkedin does nothing,btohqsg
I feel like my portfolio is bad compared to theirs but then some of them I saw that they include things like PE rep then I don't feel so bad already,btohqsg
Yea got 1 guy put PE rep,btohqsg
Tbh i did not include my comps sia,btohqsg
Gosh isn't the racket heavy as fuck,btohqsg
Like the bottom part hit my eye,btohqsg
I didn't go for many comps in y3y4 due to my mental health issues 🤡,btohqsg
and also I had massive burnout due to personal issues,btohqsg
People dun really put stuff fr sec sch  usually at most is fr jc onwards,btohqsg

Most ppl in sny i think,btohqsg
Like the lack of skill or attitude or what,btohqsg
Tbh the reason why my sec sch performing arts ccas are to high standards for v long is coz of the strict instructors and intense training,btohqsg
I played 龙腾虎跃 and 龙的传奇 for my secondary SYFand飞天 and 草原上 for JC SYF hahaBoth pairs of songs are choice pieces,btohqsg

Aren't daruan strings kinda thicker than zhongruan strings,btohqsg
Im not sure percussion has no strings to break,btohqsg
On purpose or what and any repercussions?,btohqsg
Could be the ambient temperature and resultant tension too,btohqsg
Sadly it aint holidays for me:-(,btohqsg

Man I've never felt this old,btohqsg
LOL idrmb help I wrote iirc,btohqsg
both march and sep is 1 wk,btohqsg
I didn’t write that but I don’t think that’s what he meant. The point is if we use machine learning algorithms that is fed data from what happened in the past  if there is a bias against a certain demographic and the data is fed to the computer  it will inevitably also be biased unless something is done to it. The computer is just making decisions from the data it’s been fed after all  and I thought that’s also the same case that’s happening with the chat GPT thing kuro brought up.,btohqsg
Welp it is what it is,btohqsg
my term doesn't end until 15 march,btohqsg
plus i started sch ltr mah,btohqsg
i still got a ton of holiday hw tho :'),btohqsg
I still need compile hols hw,btohqsg

Then afterwards they realised that that is my cousin,btohqsg
I took 1.5h to retrieve these photos lmao,btohqsg

(but she cant teach for god sake),btohqsg
i pray i can pass pw,btohqsg
It's prolly harder to fail PW,btohqsg
im gonna be the only pw failure,btohqsg
i think in the grading system only A B C,btohqsg
"""yijc students are the reason why everyone else passes""",btohqsg
i realise there were only 19 As and 450 passes in my cohort,btohqsg
i heard pw was graded internally during covid,btohqsg
if u fail  u go to clb??,btohqsg
They give U the opt to either retake H1 or retake clb,btohqsg
To just drop to clb then take mid year paper,btohqsg
i tot it is damn hard to get clb,btohqsg
I mean get U for H1 chi mah....,btohqsg
but clb grades wun count in anything right.,btohqsg
oh wait he got U ah,btohqsg
lol i rmb mt results collection in class. people getting e alr celebrate liao. and u wanna know what’s the funnier thing? The only A in my class is someone who retained,btohqsg

When I saw I got C,btohqsg
Cuz I got hope for B hahahaha,btohqsg
But like a few seconds later I'm like,btohqsg
i didnt really care about chinese knowing that it wun affect y rp in any way haha,btohqsg
ya lor. mt no need score well one. even if A only contribute like .5 to your rp lol 😂,btohqsg
but someone in my class got from D to B i think,btohqsg
wait there is such a thing,btohqsg
i drop from mye and prelims lol,btohqsg
mye and prelims C then a-level become D 💀,btohqsg
me is consistent D no change lol,btohqsg
But tbh I think I royally fucked up written for actual,btohqsg
i feel language hard to jump unlike other subj,btohqsg
Shld be can get B one,btohqsg
i actually failed chinese listening before,btohqsg
WAH and i was already happy with my merit,btohqsg
i think for actual  i counted 6/10 lmao,btohqsg
when i suppose it supposed to be free marks to some people,btohqsg
i think my class actual lc average was like 7/10. i also 7/10,btohqsg
Cuz I rmb it was a disaster toe,btohqsg
I literally cracked a joke during the convo bruh,btohqsg
there was someone in my class who cried after getting PW B,btohqsg
How tf U joke ard during Ur fucking,btohqsg
your examiners probably enjoyed ur joke since u got dist 😂,btohqsg
Cuz one of the qns they ask me abt smth smth,btohqsg
for me my oral we had to file a report against the examiners,btohqsg
The markers confirm also laugh while reading my written script,btohqsg
i forgot the chinese paper format alr,btohqsg
I somehow managed to talk to my neighbour in chi somewhat,btohqsg
idk how to finish p2 lol. 1h 30m but compre need write until so long,btohqsg
coz the whole class complain to the cher about the examiner...like was a straight face at us throughout (i forgot the word to describe it),btohqsg
so last 10 min i always jump to summary cos summary more free marks,btohqsg
this actually reminds me of once i wrote 4 lines (+ handwriting like ant) for a chem 1m qns,btohqsg
coz i dunno what is enough  so i just write everything,btohqsg
it is humans that is really hard to finish,btohqsg
my actual paper leave q23 and q24 blank lol,btohqsg
I alw finish my econs n geog papers so far,btohqsg
the first time i finished my econs paper was the A levels,btohqsg

my GP cher was yapping about taylor swift,btohqsg
i cant remember how i got number 5 in cohort in mbt,btohqsg
lol same. but u know why? cos they remove 8m due to clt,btohqsg
when i got D in promos,btohqsg
"""val is the reason why people fail promos""- a wise person",btohqsg
if they never remove 8m idk if i would have gotten A lol,btohqsg
u mean they removed the 8m qns in csq,btohqsg
2020 & 2021 got common last topic (clt)  cause of covid so they remove clt qns,btohqsg
but the 8m is in csq right,btohqsg
can remove clt qns for H2 maths pls 😁,btohqsg
h1 econs clt is monetary policy. got one 8m qn in 2020 h1 econs is monetary policy,btohqsg
the world if val doesn't get 90rp:,btohqsg
if the cohort do really badly  they will moderate all grades,btohqsg
you're the reason why tmjc is still relevant,btohqsg
mine never moderate A-D even tho more than half the cohort failed,btohqsg
I rmb only D-E get modded,btohqsg
but h1 phy they let it be lmao,btohqsg
H1 phy the U rate was 50% but they didnt moderate...,btohqsg
i think this is the worst ever a cohort can get,btohqsg
and the h1 phy cohort is 61 people only,btohqsg
oh they showed ah  for mine iirc is subj by subj,btohqsg
A lvl exam papers date and time,btohqsg
For all the subjs my class ppl take,btohqsg
cause gp they purposely set easy. at least for my class everyone passed,btohqsg
I had a friend got S,btohqsg
i always just pass throughout the 2y,btohqsg
When promos for GP come out,btohqsg
ur class is mix combi ah,btohqsg
Saw someone cry in the lt,btohqsg
coz me and xavier time  tm clases are mostly single subject combination,btohqsg
my batch S4 and S5 still mixed cause not standard,btohqsg
CMEp n CMEb ppl betw 411 n 412,btohqsg
S2 all pcme  S3 all bcme,btohqsg
The last class for S2 is PCMx,btohqsg
X is humans thats not econs,btohqsg
my batch im not sure what S401-404 are  but S411 & S412 CMEp  S413 CMEb,btohqsg
im not sure S414 and S415 are what  then S501 & S502 is hybrid,btohqsg
The joke got made alot by my tsd friends haha,btohqsg
yea the last classes for S2 and S3 are PCM and BCM with another humans,btohqsg
then S301 is BCME / BCMe,btohqsg
oh yeah my batch is S201-10 PCMe  S211-13 PCMx  S301 BCME/e  S302-07 BCMe  S308-09 BCMx,btohqsg
wah my batch is a giant sia honestly,btohqsg
my batch seem to have the most hybrid classes,btohqsg
Meanwhile my cg rep does nth,btohqsg
leaves all these to the subject reps to do the reminders,btohqsg
but uk for the whole 2y my cg rep couldnt log to her tmip i think,btohqsg
i think the password cant be changed,btohqsg
need go through admin to change,btohqsg
then like they if need use tmip to verify marks how lol,btohqsg
for my batch the mark sheets are printed out,btohqsg
But like I just do since,btohqsg
I alrd doing it for myself,btohqsg
wait what is the diff between cg rep and psl,btohqsg
Figured I might as well do for my class,btohqsg
But usu we just help eo with shit when we can la,btohqsg
actually it is a good initiative (but im not sure coz it didnt happen for my batch ah),btohqsg
did the class become more bonded,btohqsg
Tbh I believe my role is,btohqsg
Just make sure no one is suffering alone,btohqsg
Just no inter clique beef good enough,btohqsg
The principal say some schs asking abt how TM's psl do stuff lol,btohqsg
actually as i was retrieving a photo from my dad's phone  i saw something interesting and WOW...coz my class bully was same cca as my cousin. Then my cousin somehow knew it and when she tried running for exco  my cousin told the cher about she bullying me  and then the cher rejected the application dun let her run lmao,btohqsg
Cuz they wanna learn from us,btohqsg
It used to be more slack tho from what I hear,btohqsg
Now they give us more shit to do,btohqsg
but where did they find time for y'all to do the activities,btohqsg
Usu is either CCE lesson or booths during recess,btohqsg
sometimes it is not suffering  sometimes it is people not giving any shit about their work  that way it is hard to help tbh,btohqsg
i believe it started from xavier's batch when he j2,btohqsg
My ability to give a fuck,btohqsg
tbh in class i know who actually taking the effort and who dun give a shit,btohqsg
It's rly the guys being CB la imo,btohqsg
I legit sometimes think of rly,btohqsg
the reason why h1 phy was 50.7% U rate is the students not the tutors because h1 phy has the 2 good phy tutors (mr bryan leong and mr lim yew wei),btohqsg
as much as i know some teachers in tm are not to standard  sometimes it is the students...,btohqsg
yea i just let them do what they want to do,btohqsg
wah damn  i cant remember what goes on in CCE,btohqsg
i think 3/4 of the time i dun actually listen,btohqsg
i think i treated gp and cce lesson a mugging period,btohqsg
even if the teachers suck  it's usually still the students,btohqsg
when you mention CCE lessons in oral knowing damn well you never listen during CCE,btohqsg
tbh true  just needa do more to get the grades tho...like in jc i remembered my friends are my tutors coz my chem & math cher really cant teach (and a lot of chem and math qns are in my photo gallery lmao),btohqsg
but it is possible if u put in the effort,btohqsg
and i mean how to mug language,btohqsg
i still hv some of his messy shit on the whiteboard,btohqsg
i didnt know there was art in jc,btohqsg
