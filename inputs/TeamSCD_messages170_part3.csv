Good morning/evening!Recently  the admins at SCM have seen that there have been a bigger amount of the general public coming to car meets and not following rules given by the organisers. Thus  since this channel is filled with mostly spotters/the general piublic with no cars  weâ€™ve decided to make this poster for anyone to refer to or share this poster so that we can have better knowledge on safer and more fun meets!Do share this poster if you can so that everyone knows what to do if we are spotting at meets!,btohqsg
