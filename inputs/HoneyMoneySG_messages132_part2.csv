Have 35k spare cash  any idea where can i keep this money for a returns without risk?,btohqsg
Yes it will but I do not recommend it. The best promo codes are Visa based.The closest visa cash back card that gives 1.6% is the Maybank Barcelona card. I confirmed with Maybank CS that it will earn 1.6% on CardUp transactions.https://carduphelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024526894-Will-my-spend-on-CardUp-earn-rewards-on-my-credit-card,btohqsg
Most products have some risk. Safest will be those capital guaranteed products if u r risk adverse or fixed d.If u r okay w some risk  then chocolate finance for first 20k might be useful and maribank,btohqsg
For Citi Prestige supp cards  will main cardholder be able to see the supp card in app?,btohqsg
For Capita Integrated right issue with SCB  when they will deduct $ from our security account?,btohqsg
If it helps. Interactive brokers deducted the monies as of now Liao.,btohqsg

For DBS new card can I get virtual card 16 digits details for online payment first? Look they only give Apple Pay,btohqsg
I applied for giro deduction of both uob and Citibank cc. Apart from receiving msg from HSBC that giro was set up  I received a separate email from Citibank that Giro was set up successfully. No notification from UOB  I checked with CSO manually to verify so.,btohqsg
giro only start taking effect if the cc statement says payment will be via GIRO,btohqsg
Will check for next month statement  as current month statement was generated before set up approval. Btw  the HSBC ega account was deducted for UOB cc payment 1 day before its due date,btohqsg
Only apple pay. Can use with online merchant accepting apple pay.,btohqsg

Oh I forgot to spam here. Haha.Maybank Horizon Visa SignatureSGD Air Tickets 2.8mpd (cap $10k)SGD Insurance 0.24mpdSGD Hospital 0.24 mpdSGD Education 0.24 mpdMaybank World MastercardAll Foreign Currency Spend (2.8mpd if >$800)All Foreign Currency Spend (3.2mpd if >$4k)(Usual exclusions apply but hospital and education OK!)This is a short summary that I came up with  on which card to use if you have BOTH cards. Hope you all will find it useful.,btohqsg
TLDR: good replacement for amaze + Uob kf cc combo which is going to die. But I will only use Maybank world Mastercard if I know I have a big purchase that my existing 4mpd or better cards cannot handle. So it‚Äôs more like a backup card I will bring overseas.,btohqsg
I just saw Maybank mastercard will waive conversion fee and no expiration. üòÅIt's the main pain point of Maybank visa signature is their 1 year expiration.,btohqsg
Maybank pools points. So you can make your Maybank horizon visa signature points last forever if u get world Mastercard.,btohqsg
Supposed to but I haven't receive yet,btohqsg

Hi i applied for Citi SMRT+ however was rejected. Upon calling customer hotline  they dont know why and likely because the date of my previous successful application of CitiRewards was just 2 months ago.

Planning to purchase wedding ring and electronic appliances.,btohqsg
