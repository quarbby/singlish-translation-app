brother  every person has their own preferences and stance that they can take-- even for politicians,btohqsg
Ugh studying for finals is tiringgggg,btohqsg
How do you guys stay up awake while studying,btohqsg
cause with chinese newspaper propaganda manipulation means pro-china stance when it's not  lol,btohqsg
There's a special version FOR China,btohqsg
do you have sources in china?,btohqsg
the vpn is so whack over there,btohqsg
Like genuinely speaking HAHAHAHA cause first time I heard of this also,btohqsg
they say gen y faces theseWorld events:Â Gen Y has been impacted by world events like the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  the Dot-com Boom  and the Great Recession of 2008,btohqsg
But true  maybe it's a bit early to call it a Lost Decade.,btohqsg
Give it until the end of this decade to decide  I guess.,btohqsg
maybe a few more decades down the road,btohqsg
"In part of controversial things that stood out in Western media - ""Caning of Michael Fay""?",btohqsg
but only those older ones face this those younger ones still a child,btohqsg
Maybe they just wanna see sg fall,btohqsg
"Singapore is a ""FINE"" city? lol",btohqsg
what the fuck does a tweet from a politician world leader prove,btohqsg
I actually don't even know what this even means,btohqsg
i swear to god  every few eras (about at least one to two decades every now and then) will have a lotta changes,btohqsg
Although on the other hand  we've been tagged as a currency manipulator by the US. That can't be good...,btohqsg
"https://mustsharenews.com/michael-fay-today/""Having gained experience in the F&B industry  Mr Fay was then appointed as the Beverage Supervisor at the JACK Cincinnati  a casino in Ohio.He quickly rose through the ranks and became a Slot Operations Manager. In this role  he oversees 2 000 machines on the casino floor  as well as over 70 employees. These comprise slot attendants  valets  supervisors and assistant managers.""",btohqsg
a production supply line that was confirmed to be a taiwanese company that was barred from allowing a singapore company ( commonly known as ST Engineering  short form STE for Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd ) brought into taiwan during COVID-19,btohqsg
sounds like a Security Operator at a Casino Floor lol,btohqsg
It's been okay so far  but only because even Trump isn't insane enough to go after us yet...,btohqsg
Yes manipulation of exchange rate is a thing,btohqsg
Or are u talking abt smth else,btohqsg
depends on what context?As long the whole Singapore Financial Institution doesn't collapse. It is a good thing for everyone?,btohqsg
"you don't want end up like Japanese ""Banana"" Money lol.",btohqsg
For context: Even China has been removed from the list at times. Singapore has practically never been removed.,btohqsg
which nation doesn't have a single motherfucking issue with how USA's odd love in manipulating global or local news affairs media propaganda and PR strategies of withholding truth  details and facts ( by both the Democrat & Republican parties ) even if it's a close force allying with the US or having some form  of close political ties,btohqsg
the reason why trump seems better is because Joe Biden is still Acting President of America  as he hasn't yet sworn in the White House for his second Presidential Term,btohqsg
He's had 4 years before to do it. He did nothing.,btohqsg
but honestly  it's gonna be interesting to see how Trump will handle most  if not all odds seemingly against him and doing shit however he likes ( when compared with his last Presidential term),btohqsg
^ see my aforementioned reply above,btohqsg
TBF I'm leaning towards Trump never actually going through with it because we might manipulate our currency  but because we don't have much domestic production  we WILL still always import more than we export,btohqsg
Not necessarily to and from the US  but in general.,btohqsg
he treats the president position with the same mindset as how he treats his entire list of business empires he had managed to build in his entrepreneurship days as a businessmna,btohqsg
So the US doesn't actually care about the currency manipulation for it to be a threat because of how little we export to the US.,btohqsg
as mentioned  trump was always known to have a strong tendency of making a lot of rebellious trial-and-error  impulsive  last minute decision-making..,btohqsg
Most of his issue with China is export dumping. Something we just can't do.,btohqsg
in comparison  joe biden seems more like a controlled puppet president,btohqsg
compared with past ex-presidents of america,btohqsg
In 2023  the US imported the following goods from Singapore:Electrical and electronic equipment: $3.24 billionMiscellaneous edible preparations: $3.05 billionMineral fuels  oils  and distillation products: $1.78 billionMiscellaneous chemical products: $668.78 millionLooked it up. Our top export category is only in the single digit billions.,btohqsg
Trump is a well-known Russian puppet.,btohqsg
so can I consider Joe Biden a Israel puppet with that same logic of your so-called XX politician is well-known to side with YY country,btohqsg
okay  im done for the time-being it's personal free time before i head to sleep ðŸ’¤,btohqsg
can call him a useful idiot toohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot,btohqsg
"""the person thinks they are fighting for a cause without fully comprehending the consequences of their actions  and who does not realize they are being manipulated by the cause's leaders or by other political players.""",btohqsg
also is there a term for someone that has the brains but is not using it correctly?,btohqsg
biden might think he's doing what's best for the USA  even though bibi clearly disrespects himhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/stained-relations-israeli-pm-netanyahu-accused-taking-dirty-laundry-state-trips,btohqsg
