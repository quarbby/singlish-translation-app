RP got allergy to giving students good GPA,btohqsg
They aren't rlly unis like private unis we call em but they are basically just a building,btohqsg
didnt you say that rpÊ¼s system is rigged,btohqsg
imagine if you were in rp,btohqsg
Yeah if u get above 2.5 u can get credit exemptions,btohqsg
but seriously why are their cut offs so low,btohqsg
Which means like u study only for 1- 1.5 years,btohqsg
i feel like even some ite courses have better cut offs than theirs,btohqsg
this is MDIS which is priv uni,btohqsg
^ again it ain't that bad ngl,btohqsg
i must be a billionaire to afford it,btohqsg
It's just private u don't get the uni experience plus the same recognition,btohqsg
I mean if the GPA cmi u probably get into work immediately and don't really have a choice either ways,btohqsg
like this course for example. better than rpÊ¼s cut offs,btohqsg
Yeah they do. But at the end of the day RPs courses are accepted as diploma,btohqsg
While ITEs Hnitec is not. Those numbers are there reflecting that nature lor,btohqsg
ya and ite is js a cert,btohqsg

rp has a intake of 4x more than all 3 ite's combined.rp has a student population of 9x more than all 3 ite's combined,btohqsg
If the bunny is the emperor then whats the hamster,btohqsg
Yeah engi is always the massive intake,btohqsg
That's why I say u BME technically the competition like GPA requirements are not as strict,btohqsg
so rp is the dumping ground of all polys,btohqsg
yea..so rp increase their cutoff..ite gonna be overfilled,btohqsg
thats why they have many students,btohqsg
btw this figure will show you,btohqsg
the hamster is the royal advisor... Advising the bunny to ask for more treats ðŸ˜¼ðŸ˜¼,btohqsg

btw did i tell yall the hamster lore like why i bought it,btohqsg
not very nice to say that,btohqsg
im in my intern now  cant study much anymore,btohqsg
maybe ite students are just better at hands on learning...,btohqsg
Hamsters are just a fancy rat. Convince me otherwise,btohqsg
rp is also a dumping ground fr,btohqsg
