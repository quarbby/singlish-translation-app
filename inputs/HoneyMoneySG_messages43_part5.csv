Japan ATM charged me 220 Yen fee for 50k Yen withdrawal using YouTrip last year. Just checked. FYI. 50K withdrawal limit is low coz those in 7-11 allow 100k limit,btohqsg
50k yen is like sgd500 only.,btohqsg
Hey@ChrisHMSG  I used the referral link you have provided here for my HSBC Card. I just contacted HSBC and found out that I will only be eligible for the Singsaver $30 and not the existing HSBC Offer (Samsonite or $150 Cashback).....Could you please double confirm what was your arrangement with Singsaver? If the promotion is different please be honest about it to your members....,btohqsg
from the referenced post:- EXISTING Customers: Get $50 Cashback+additional $30 from using the linkare you saying you are a new-to-bank customer?,btohqsg
Yes I am a new to HSBC Customer. From the post  I should be getting $30 Cash + HSBC Rewards.,btohqsg
ah yes  misunderstood your posti would assume new customers would get both too,btohqsg
The offer message is correct with $150 (HSBC) + $30 (Singsaver) as communicated by Singsaver. Do direct your queries toinfo@singsaver.com.sgas they are the main coordinatorsI'm not sure who you contacted from HSBC team. But it is possible that the CS and Marketing are not aligned with each other,btohqsg
Thanks for responding Chris 😄 appreciate it. I spoke to the HSBC customer support. Alright I will contact singsaver directly.,btohqsg
6300 mcc normally so excluded everywhereUnless there’s CardUp etc,btohqsg
Sorry  only Trust is credit card right?The rest is prepaid?,btohqsg
Hi I used DBS women world card to make purchase on Japan website. Per DBS apps  I see an unbilled amount pertaining to the overseas purchase in SGD reflecting in the credit card section. May I know if this unbilled amount is already inclusive of transaction fee  or whether the transaction fee will only be reflected in actual bill?,btohqsg
The payment was made in JPY. After a few days  the JPY amount has reflected as SGD.,btohqsg
i have fund the amount but have not see any reward. is it the reward will only be available after 30 days? thanks,btohqsg
(9 + 10)@DxCollections  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Btw I made it a point not to apply to Singsaver promos  as I have a feeling that they are trying to weasel out giving the gift. If you want the gift  better track it and follow up closely  else they might just pocket it.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this! I think ill nvr apply to Singsaver anymore,btohqsg
I cancelled HSBC revolution card last year and somehow I can't open EGA account now.. I can't login to the app 😩,btohqsg
As long as you are/were a HSBC credit card holder in the past  you are likely not able to open HSBC EGA online.It is due to some system issue whereby HSBC system detects missing information (we used to speculate it is due to missing AML detail).You will need to go down to branch to open HSBC EGA in such cases.,btohqsg
For Citi Rewards Card sign up promotion  may I ask if the 40 000 Citi ThankYou Points (16 000 Citi Miles) Welcome Gift from Citibank can stack on top of the $300 Cash via PayNow from SingSaver? If not  which one I should pick to maximise value?I’m new to miles card and not familiar with the miles redemption. What can I redeem with 16 000 miles? How much is 16 000 miles worth in terms of cashback?,btohqsg
Hi can I check hsbc revolution can pay telco bills? Thanks,btohqsg
Can pay bills  but no earn 10x reward points. Not on white list,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone using the DBS Live Fresh credit card? I need some help on the cashback calculation,btohqsg
You can refer to this guide for information.Source:https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/live-fresh-dbs-visa-paywave-platinum-card,btohqsg
I think there’s a calculator on the website,btohqsg
Do note the computation is based on date of posting of transactions charged to the card and not the date of charge.,btohqsg
Useless. Because i doing my own calculations and i got very close to the cashback i was given. But it seems that there is something that i had missed. I always have the 0.3% cashback but all my transactions were either contactless or online. So i am unsure what was excluded.,btohqsg
Really? When i called DBS bank they said was transaction date and not posting date.,btohqsg
I could be wrong ☺️. Most cards are based on date of posting for rewards computation.,btohqsg
I will try counting based on posting date and see if I can get the result. Thanks!,btohqsg
check whats the best credit card to use for airbnb?👀,btohqsg
yes dbs is by transaction date,btohqsg
For me  the full cash rebates come in at the next statement month. Not sure that's helpful info for you.As long as I get the bonus cashbacks (ie > 0.3%)  I didn't verify the amount of cashbacks paid by dbs is correct by doing calculations on my own. Personally  I don't think is worth the effort.,btohqsg
Alright. Because i want to know what is not included in the 5%. Like i just found out i shouldn’t be paying my phone bill using DBS Live Fresh card coz there is no benefit.,btohqsg
I learned the same from this community (thankful). Personally  using multiple cards to earn max cash rebates and air miles is administratively challenging for me.The risk of missed payments and bank not giving late payment waivers increases when we have more cards.Suggests folks here to consider risks vs rewards and make an informed decision when maintaining credit cards (after obtaining the sign up freebies).,btohqsg
i only have this card that require me to think and i want to maxmise everything. i don't find it challenging because i track every single transaction everyday for the past few years. It had became a habit and once I know how the card works I will remember it and everything will be business as usual.,btohqsg
why is there no benefit to paying phone bill by DBS Live Fresh?we were just on this topic yesterday,btohqsg
It doesn't give me cashback. So I will use my UOB One card to pay to hit the min $500 a month since my UOB One card is tied to my UOB One account.,btohqsg
oh ok what telco did you try?I was the one who said I didn't like using DBS Live Fresh to pay telcos because I wasn't sure if it could be excluded due to 'utilities'.,btohqsg
This is also one of the two cards I go to for cash rebates :). The other is CRMC.,btohqsg
Giga and Singtel. I spoke to DBS yesterday and this is what they told me.,btohqsg
Just to add on with my personal experience.When I need to meet the $600 spend limit  I manually charged my M1 and Starhub to the card. So far  I manage to get the bonus cashback.,btohqsg
