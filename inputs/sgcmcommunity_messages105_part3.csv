last year government raise the petrol duties by 15 cents  petrol company raised their prices by a substantial amount.How much increase do you all think will happen to petrol prices after 8% gst?,btohqsg
Tat y spc also not giving 23 percent discount for new year 😅,btohqsg
It’s not just about duties  it’s about the supply of oil that is available too..,btohqsg
opec is holding off production i believe,btohqsg

Very hard to get. I've tried contacting them a few times to get vouchers to giveaway to the members here but they ghost me - J,btohqsg
They LIKE SHELL. FIRST TO UP LAST TO DOWN,btohqsg
All thanks to Biden administration who drummed up war on Ukraine  knowing that Russia will definitely strike when Ukraine applied for NATO membership which it’s against treaty that were signed decades ago.U.S is selling expensive oil and gas to Europe due to Russia cutting of oil supply to Europe. Of course who was behind Nord Stream pipeline sabotage is still unknown. OPEC is not cooperating with USA request because of Biden.Politics always at play and because politicians in the States wanna make America Great Again  at the expense of the World. That is why  we are all suffering from higher price hike and inflation. Maybe amongst us  economic analysts can fill us in as well. 2023 will be an expensive year ahead. Godspeed everyone 🙏,btohqsg
Shell will always give vouchers one though,btohqsg
