WP would be bigger if they had the power to compete in every grc,btohqsg
I think they will never change Aljunied tbh…,btohqsg
They only won Hougang by big margin,btohqsg

Problem is their manpower not their power,btohqsg
And also yea they also need to fight w the other oppositions coz 3 way fight is not it,btohqsg

Neh Singapore wun be going for that,btohqsg
WP don't do 3 ways one their strategy is just focus on East for now,btohqsg
And then make sure to be the only opposition,btohqsg
Tbh Pritam has said no to this,btohqsg
By product of our first past the post winner takes all system,btohqsg
U will have a 2 party system for that no matter what it's damn annoying and honestly no one talks about electoral reform. It would be much better to have a proportional representation system,btohqsg
