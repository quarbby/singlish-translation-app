iirc a lot of students on r/sgexams reddit tend to be very lowkey with discussing exam questions after that incident,btohqsg
In my opinion  discussing and distributing papers are totally different things,btohqsg
It feels like they are solely asking for the paper rather than discussing it,btohqsg
yes that's the case but it's often blurred between the lines before something actually happens when someone gets caught for illegally distributing papers,btohqsg
Ohh I see..I didn't know it worked this way but I see a possibility,btohqsg
yeah  it's not just distribution vs discussing but generally people will think two matters may be similar in nature but not realize that they hold different meanings in most situations,btohqsg
Some teachersfor the subjects request for the paper,btohqsg
isn't that more for the teachers' internal reference and discussion,btohqsg
because if they were to publicly share the questions set in exams not even a day after the test for said subject has wrapped up  it can escalate into something nasty,btohqsg
Yeah they are not allowed to discuss or share the materials with their students,btohqsg
"usually teachers just love to tease the students with ""im very.. disappointed/happy with the results of most of the class results"" if they happen to be in the marking team",btohqsg
i used to think it was pretty dreadful but now i would rather get spoilers for how well i do rather than not knowing at all until results day,btohqsg
at least most teachers can roughly estimate students' strengths after teaching the same subject for a classnearly a whole year down the road  i reminisce about secondary school school days but time will never go back to the past (even though i didn't have a life in school for the most part  i cherish the memories made over there),btohqsg
actually you should know how well you do,btohqsg
yeah but getting someone else to gauge your ability is more interesting to know of and listen from someone other than yourself,btohqsg
i like to think this somehow applies with the logic of why doctors don't treat themselves,btohqsg
life there is bad but still cherish?,btohqsg
maybe it's just me being somewhat sadomasochistic qwq,btohqsg

Best u can do is revise those concepts,btohqsg
I think if I am not wrong someone a few yrs back also sent the actual listening comprehension recordings on youtube. It got removed after,btohqsg
Well tbh they were pretty accessible considering they used local radio lmao,btohqsg
sometimes we have our own tutors/educators group and some stuff gets shared around.,btohqsg
