Then I wrote uh everyday what we know is changing  so if we dont adapt we will be out of date and cant really do anything,btohqsg
How is Q3 difficult to understand? The story prob abit hard to imagine but I don’t understand how so many ppl don’t know what 竞争 is lol,btohqsg
Idk whether I wrote out of point,btohqsg
Shit I got 6 and 12,btohqsg
Though I would say Q3 is difficult for brain juices wise. Haha with a Govt that places so much emphasis on 竞争力 probably very difficult to go against the grain and criticise it,btohqsg
I think your points are ok but you also have to address on 成功part to get higher marks,btohqsg
The last qn is so random,btohqsg
It’s just the 启发 question disguised,btohqsg
