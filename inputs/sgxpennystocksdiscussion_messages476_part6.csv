1 dose is good enough to prevent death  which is the key purpose of vaccination,btohqsg
Gov pushing for 2 doses to save the hospitals,btohqsg

Grab will push hard for Digital Bank,btohqsg

Singapore want to show the world we can live with covid as an endemic. Have covid cases but no serious illness (hopefully).,btohqsg

What can Singtel offer that the local banks can't,btohqsg
trusted names  better products  no/few branches  low overheads,btohqsg
Better products is a high bar ... Given grab and SingTel's past record,btohqsg

And another one  falling stock price,btohqsg
raising fees is the standard textbook business play,btohqsg

Waa you think like that ah,btohqsg
Really ah..I thought they UK one,btohqsg
