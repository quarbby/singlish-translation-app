Like to share my bad experience picking up an order at Royal Indian restaurant at Jalan Besar this morning.,btohqsg
I accepted the order at 3:10 this morning. I called to confirm the order with the shop and made my way down. When I reached the shop  the staff told me their are still preparing the food and need another 5 mins. While waiting  the staff told me that he is going to add another destination (20 Swiss road)  but he told me verbally and he said he will add $5 for the extra location. He said he will pay me cash and not edit the order. I told the staff that I can‚Äôt accept the order because I have another pick up at 4:10am and that I won‚Äôt be on time for the next pick up. If I am late for pick up  i can‚Äôt prove that I had to deliver to another location because on the app  this order number only shows one delivery destination. Furthermore the distance of the second location is too far from the Sentosa (original delivery location). Upon hearing that I am not agreeable to his suggestion  he told me he have to cancel the job. I said it is not fair for me as I have been waiting close to 10 mins already at the shop and I have travelled all the way down to the shop to pick up this order. After a few minutes of exchanges between me and the staff  he went head and cancelled the order in front of my eyes via his order terminal. I said this is not fair for me and if he wanted to add another location  he should have posted the original order with the 2 locations instead and any drivers could see and decide if they can fulfil this order or not based on the 2 locations. He told me if he did that  he won‚Äôt get a driver at this hour (3am). And he also told me that he is not obligated to tell me anything before hand. He said he is entitled to add and cancel the job any time as he pleases. I asked him so now in this instance  how do we settle this. He said there is nothing to settle as the job is already cancelled and I can leave. Please take note of this merchant‚Äôs behaviour as it will cause many drivers and riders a lot of inconvenience and wasted time due to the shop staff unethical behaviour.,btohqsg
