Not sure also..My guess is if to forgo the coil over den you lose the programming and stick to the aftermarket coil..Give and take lo,btohqsg
as long as dont keep display warnings can liao ba,btohqsg
Have to off that from settings,btohqsg
Can off via settings if not den through the master programmer,btohqsg
Lowering springs if I not wrong,btohqsg
then the active dampers still there,btohqsg
Den I can change to lowering spring,btohqsg
But it will probably damage your dampers,btohqsg
they may have a plug to fool the active damper sensor that it's still there.,btohqsg
Hmm okie..nvm I will do up more research on this ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
is your wheel gap currently high?,btohqsg
about 3 finger gaptbh my car already vry low,btohqsg
open door it just nice to clear the kerb if lower i cant park near the kerb,btohqsg
it will hit or door will get stuck,btohqsg
there will be certain carparks you can't go,btohqsg
mine if i go leisure park  sure to scrape  also fullerton hotel exit,btohqsg
one fullerton still ok  but fullerton i cannot,btohqsg
my clearance is far so goodable to clear most of the carpark,btohqsg
also the shell carwash at geylang i cannot,btohqsg
mine about 1 half to 2,btohqsg
mx5 is a fun car to drive,btohqsg
When i running 16 inch i was scraping everything,btohqsg
go up HDB slope also scrape,btohqsg
17 looks nice on your car bro,btohqsg
now dont scrape most of the things,btohqsg
but he probably get more performance on the 16,btohqsg
like maybe 1 out of 10 humps I'll scrape,btohqsg
i can probably buy bigger profile 16inch tyres la,btohqsg
that new exhaust won't look so new,btohqsg
i might lower might a little bit more  maybe half finger,btohqsg
unless i install my 4 point bar again,btohqsg
now you already cant go some of the carpark,btohqsg
yeah but i saw old photos of my car when it was lower,btohqsg
later you lower more...you cant go anywhere bro,btohqsg
if i install the bar again  for sure i can't go lower,btohqsg
but will make the chassis a bit stiffer,btohqsg
4 point bar should be able to stiffen your car chassis,btohqsg
but it hit a couple of humps then started rattling so i took it out,btohqsg
better dont install 4 point bar bro..your car is already vry stable in corner / high speed corner,btohqsg
if too stiff passenger and driver wont be able to enjoy long drive,btohqsg
I think if nv track dont do ba,btohqsg
daily might have feel the diff,btohqsg
if track alr feel need then do. Might not even need also,btohqsg
might not even feel the diff*,btohqsg
lowering can but make sure you check on and pair with the right spring rate.  too soft  the stroke will not be enough or will increase the stress on the absorber thereby reducing the lifespan of your absorber.  If you have edc you can purchase an add on/plug in module for edc delete  or code it out also possible on quite a few cars.,btohqsg
got 2 different bars at home just sitting in the store,btohqsg
bro why your name so complicated,btohqsg
okie noted and thanks for the advise,btohqsg
"should call you ""anwo the 3rd""",btohqsg
might be an idea to check the pitch of your car  and also distance from ground to the lowest point of your front bumper (assuming you are having mostly front bumper scraps or is it middle?).,btohqsg
