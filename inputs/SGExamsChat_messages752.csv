Usually it is only ~10 per house get in,btohqsg
I remembered my batch one house only had 8 councillors💀💀,btohqsg
Yes REAL…then i remembered ppl complaining on confession page sc bias,btohqsg
My cca all 4 who ran councillors got in and say bye bye to the cca💀💀,btohqsg
Actually ogl rejection is q a substantial amt coz qty demanded  >> qty supplied,btohqsg
How many sc in ur class? My class had none and only 2 out of 13 got selected,btohqsg
Dun be surprised there are classes a lot of ogl  the number of ppl left in class is ard 5-10,btohqsg
Actually hor the sc know the complains on confession were all fr my class,btohqsg
Coz i think my class had the highest rejection rates,btohqsg
They did well for interview I feel,btohqsg
Coz got one sc go ask me during the overseas trip ‘ur class complain not happy say we bias in ogl selection right’,btohqsg
Then he told me he know who wrote all the rants,btohqsg

and they drop the jh cca so,btohqsg
any1 wants to buy abt 80 boba u4t switches?,btohqsg
also pog finally step down from cca,btohqsg
defo need to utilise the time wisely,btohqsg
Oh so they automatically in sc sh also?,btohqsg
If udw be in sc in sh have to appeal out,btohqsg
Actually fr the outside can see alr,btohqsg
Oh wah but good for them  and i dun think many will appeal out coz sc is pretty privileged position but the commitment in jc defo much higher than in jh,btohqsg
If you want to run in y3 you must first be an intern in y2Being an intern look at your gpa and conduct and needs interview. And that is only to be an intern. Alot of SC interns dont even run for elections in Y3. If you want to run in y3   you must have been an intern and have more interviews . And you may not even get voted in in y3.In y5 its only interview and running,btohqsg
Got politics with batchmates then got politics with ur junios,btohqsg
But I'll do it again la teehee,btohqsg
someone told me sc very 💀💀😬,btohqsg
i cant say too much because idw betray my friends trust,btohqsg
but yea its not all sunshines and flowers,btohqsg
Campaigning for sc is crazy bruh,btohqsg
bruh one guy who got fair conduct grade in y4 is running for sc rn,btohqsg
Also during my batch when we were campaigning it was the height of like feminism or smth,btohqsg
Every girl was super openly against guys,btohqsg
but 4 ppl got rejected after sc interviews (my friend in sc told me)2 ppl who are siaolang since y1 so its kinda understandable and 2 JAEs,btohqsg
also that day alr got ppl shittalking the jae guy in my og calling him a monkey,btohqsg
"Like thr were alot of people who were like ""I'll vote XX cuz she's a girl and we don't need guys in leadership positions""",btohqsg
bro you been in sch for like 2 months got ppl shittalking you alr 💀💀😬,btohqsg
Cuz my friend who was like head prefect in my sch didn't get council cuz my batch girls didn't want too many guys in council,btohqsg
The only harder thing I can see is that scdf has mc restriction,btohqsg
oh shit didnt know five guys nex closed,btohqsg
1 day light duty = 0.5 day MC,btohqsg
actually how does shake shack compare,btohqsg
Isn’t that good? I was referring to how scdf restricts ppl from taking private/poly MC if you exceed 30 days of MC in a calendar year,btohqsg
I heard sth like after 30 days of MC in one year they send you for a medical review to see whether you should be restricted from taking private/poly MC. Then they might force you to report to CDA everytime you want MC which sucks,btohqsg
But ya it starts from firefighter course also,btohqsg
Ya then meanwhile with SAF can ck everyday without mc restriction,btohqsg
That’s why some ppl say they know ppl who report to camp only twice in one year lol,btohqsg
Yes can see fr the outside,btohqsg
Wah and why was his conduct fair,btohqsg
he sent inappropriate email to the teacher (idk the specifics cause i heard from someone),btohqsg
the boy in my class also got into trouble for similar stuff apparently (he also got fair conduct grade),btohqsg
That's sounds like a typical teenage guy,btohqsg
If it's not sending inappropriate shit it's doing inappropriate shit,btohqsg
Knn got some old lady singing in the middle of the park...I thought I kenna pontianak,btohqsg
i cant say anym cause it would be doxxing alr,btohqsg
ryan in ur opinion what kind of inappropriate email will a teenage guy send to teachers,btohqsg
Tbh I dk how high tech ppl are cause the last I've known  idk any of my teachers email,btohqsg
our sch has an email system,btohqsg
Oh you mean that kind of email  my school is famous for it,btohqsg
Maybe bombing threats? Or various threats kind of emails?,btohqsg
Oh wait I did in J2,btohqsg
I made a world hunger joke,btohqsg
Cuz I was giving away free burger King vouchers,btohqsg
ya i got cancelled for this,btohqsg
for the funniest of shit back in EJ,btohqsg
i rmbr i got cancelled once cuz i didnt follow a girl home at night,btohqsg
then everyone said i was being uncaring and not looking out for others,btohqsg
the cancel culture in my batch,btohqsg
THEY THINK UW GET INTO HER PANTS,btohqsg
"i also got cancelled cuz apparnatly i ""stalked"" a girl home",btohqsg
oh in j1 i got cancelled for ghosting cca,btohqsg
then when i confronted the girl,btohqsg
cuz my national team “cca” was in the middle of getting approved,btohqsg
apparantly this rumour started cause this girl's friend was my council competitor's boyfriend so it was to like,btohqsg
i dont rmbr whether it was council or ogl,btohqsg
ej sounds like a scary place,btohqsg
wait the yemen one is damn funny tho,btohqsg
its me as a marketing kid,btohqsg
someone replied to my email with this,btohqsg
i was the one writing that,btohqsg
i gave a shit ton of burger king vouchers to the whole sch,btohqsg
"burger king used to have this glitch where u can like play this ""game' then everytime u play the game u get free vouchers",btohqsg
i have bio wa tmr AMA,btohqsg
"so i created this excel sheet called""Singapore Food Bank""",btohqsg
then inside i just put the codes for all the different food,btohqsg
like me and my friends la,btohqsg
but yes i got cancelled by some guys for this,btohqsg
"cuz they said i was ""taking it too far""",btohqsg
"and my actions would ""lead to the burger king workers getting underpaid""",btohqsg
"and ""giving in to corporate exploitation""",btohqsg
man i thought dudes were cooler than this,btohqsg
the people who told me these,btohqsg
no its “of course i took it too far  but did i start it?”,btohqsg
were the same people talking abt how rape should be legalised and how hate crimes should not be illegal,btohqsg
bro idk what is their moral compass man,btohqsg
but alls well that was 2 years ago,btohqsg
nvm only one of them made it back as a teacher,btohqsg
ngl the sad thing for me was,btohqsg
alot of them were my closer friends in CHS,btohqsg
okay but tbf they were q toxic as well,btohqsg
i remember one of them took my exam paper to try and argue with a cher why i didnt deserve marks for some questions so i wouldnt have gotten higher than him,btohqsg
we used to compare exam scripts,btohqsg
and flex that we got lower than each other,btohqsg
bro it was just a chs thing,btohqsg
every chs student thinks theyre gods greatest gift to mankind or smth,btohqsg
(even me but i actually am) eh sie,btohqsg
go live my dream for me,btohqsg
Bro i aint going to law,btohqsg
"""ur a guy u shouldnt be in law""",btohqsg

cannot stop with the ig reels grind,btohqsg
cuz sec sch idek ah maybe I reclusive but like only one caning case and it was private caning so only the class get to see,btohqsg
Do u consider that at the point of time peak brainrot for u,btohqsg
Wait just to be clear were you cancelled for the joke or for giving out free vouchers,btohqsg
If it’s free vouchers that’s fking retarded lol,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like it’s possible to avoid being cancelled entirely if you just lay low,btohqsg
i mean tbf the world food thing ig it was,btohqsg
During jc I tried to remain as invisible as I can,btohqsg
Eh but i did not expect it to be fair,btohqsg
am I wrong to think cancel culture is kinda stupid,btohqsg
It’s funny. Do those people think we live in a “post joke world” lmao,btohqsg
cancel culture is q stupid if its for,btohqsg
I actually cant imagine coz i scared to email tcr💀Maybe that dude send some loving story to tcr or sth,btohqsg

Cost of lack of sleep > benefit of doing geog tut,btohqsg
it's just pure muscle memory at this point,btohqsg

I had to stop and wait a sec  ask myself wtf is P=MC and went OHH internally,btohqsg
why not i do ur geog tut for u,btohqsg
idk how some ppl the moment they tired rite they can bump into things as they walk,btohqsg
Send u the tutorial tho tbh,btohqsg
Hello polis  yes this guy overcharging,btohqsg
Oh ya forgot you PU2 and not 3,btohqsg
Was having one of those moments where I forgot things temporarily,btohqsg
Tbh how does p=mc come abt I forgot,btohqsg
it's one of the v fundamentals shit,btohqsg
and that's as far as ik,btohqsg
I only recall that being inside market structure,btohqsg
Unless if I got brainrot then forgot where else it comes in,btohqsg
smth to do with the price mechanism analysis,btohqsg
Market structure isn’t in h1 tho,btohqsg
Market dominance as a cause of market failure also isn’t,btohqsg
Errr my notes got say 😭😅,btohqsg
I learnt in just last yr,btohqsg
Owh wtf did Ian get banned,btohqsg
Btw valerie my teacher was like 😰 when i told him my contrasting was H2 hist,btohqsg
Show me where in the syllabus got firms and decisions for h1,btohqsg
p=mc is in market failure not market structure,btohqsg
Then idk if your sch is being extra,btohqsg
Ya but market dominance as a cause of market failure is not inside h1,btohqsg
Idts it was tryna exp a concept,btohqsg
Ya but it's not mentioned in market dom,btohqsg
They don’t even have asymmetric info,btohqsg
Eh... P=MC is mentioned in public goods,btohqsg
the one sub i got A in but idk what the fuck i was doing,btohqsg
Smth smth additional cost additional profit for firms,btohqsg
my teacher also dk how the fuck i got it,btohqsg
if i get the perfect like 20-30 min where i am not too groggy dam nice,btohqsg
or i sometimes end up doing 1.5 or 2.5,btohqsg
My econs test tmr on growth,btohqsg
From h1 syllabus documentKnowledge of asymmetric information  adverse selection and moral hazard  market dominance and factor immobility are not required.,btohqsg
Lucky they allowed cheat sheet OMEGALOL,btohqsg
Ya but only 2 pages of paper allowed so,btohqsg
Dawg they never state the size,btohqsg
What is your opinion of giving someone 1 dollar in 10 10 cents,btohqsg
Nah they got say A4 aha,btohqsg
if someone did that to me i'm just gonna tell them to keep it,btohqsg
she want to collect the money from me,btohqsg
kuro would love it tho  adds more to his fat wallet,btohqsg
Ok I'll be sure to be like kuro and make u intimidated by it,btohqsg
Ok ya then maybe that’s where he learnt it from. Didn’t cross my mind. P=MC is needed to show how market fails since Mc of public goods is 0 due to non rivalry  so market will not be allocatively efficient given that producers have to charge a price above 0,btohqsg
no i mean sometimes the 20 min timer one day is just nice some other days not enuff,btohqsg
But other than that I don’t think anywhere else in h1 has,btohqsg
Uhhhhhh I don't rmb that in market failure?,btohqsg
I j realised u cn chat alr,btohqsg
my naps are usually a crash that results from staying up late,btohqsg
actl i hope she scolds me,btohqsg
Oh mec is it you're referring to? Marginal external cost,btohqsg
Sometimes it’s just luck I guess. Econs has quite a bit of fluctuations between internal exams and a levels,btohqsg
wish i got that kinda dedication fr,btohqsg
my schedule is less rigid than yours,btohqsg
Ok cuz like for TM we haven't cover factor immobility for market failure iirc,btohqsg
with soy sauce and white pepper,btohqsg
gude have you found ways to cure your boredom,btohqsg
Then idk at this point. Cos P=MC mainly comes inside market structure or market failure (mainly for market dominance),btohqsg
technically either schedule is up to the individual,btohqsg
honestly mine is not rigid enuff for sec 4 lol,btohqsg
P=MC also isn’t in factor immobility,btohqsg
And factor immobility isn’t in h1 too,btohqsg
Basically it means there’s no such thing as jokes and everything is taken literally,btohqsg
I keep thinking that you've majored in econ,btohqsg
I’m only good at the qualitative part not quantitative,btohqsg
Oh wow there's another part to it,btohqsg
Yeah jc pretty much doesn’t care about the math at all,btohqsg
Uni places a much bigger emphasis on that,btohqsg
Knn might as well give 1 cent,btohqsg
If it’s giving and not lending sure,btohqsg
any1 know how do critically anaylse provenance of surprise qns ss,btohqsg
she collected gp notes so i have to pay her,btohqsg
Oh then better not. Why not just put your money in a vending machine then refund it,btohqsg
Most will give back your change in bigger coins,btohqsg
I mean I’m also pretty sure that all Jcs have vending machines so can also do it in sch,btohqsg
well if you're alr in the realm of pettiness  anything goes,btohqsg
cause she say paylah is preferred,btohqsg
y not 20 5 cents instead,btohqsg
i mean  up the petty game,btohqsg
if only 1 cent stil exists,btohqsg
i've quite abit of 5 cents,btohqsg
I guess I am getting old. Back in my day it was the 1 cent.,btohqsg

Haha u are playing with fire here. Depends on what do u mean by the terms Singapore if u just meant the administration which controlled Singapore with your snarky comments on the 1/2 cent which was issued by the straits settlements and later Malaya then I would also have u know there was even a 2 1/2 cent coin and even a 2 cent coin following the administration of the British Empire in indirect or direct rule as a colony. The 2 cent is slightly anachronistic as it was issue and minted in for use in the Caribbeans but the 2 1/2 cent coin was issued and minted for the State of North Borneo  both of which are protectorates of the British Empire at that time and would be part of Malaya.,btohqsg

I am fucking serious u little shit. U are about to get a fucking intro into Currency even if u don't like it  both coins are typical of the British empire and its rapid industrialisation and spread  but they are different in that the materials for both differed one being made of Bronze and the other made of the more familiar Cupronickel.This was due to new methods of production which made alloys more cost efficient to work with and mint. Cupronickel is very durable and provides a luster and shine even when heavily tarnished  this is in contrast to the Bronze coins which often oxidised and coated the coin in a rusty layer.,btohqsg

i thought i was gonna get a intro of how the 1/2 cent came about not the materials coins are made from,btohqsg
arent a b and c the same just different sequence,btohqsg
Oh the coins production is interesting as well. The Bronze coin 1/2 cent was mainly made in Tower Hill Mint. Often it was the only mint who could handle the mass economies of scale required for the fabrication and mintage of the planchets and the press from a die. This was not the case for the 2 1/2 cent coin which was minted in Birmingham clearly reflective of the rapid industrialisation and growth of the British empire.,btohqsg

DEVELOPING: SCDF is battling a fire in the Eunos industrial area  near Geylang Serai market and several malls in Paya Lebar.Avoid the area:https://cna.asia/49fAttm,btohqsg
Speaking of fires it's interesting how fire suppression works.. granted the floor and building is fucked but it is contained to it for almost all modern day fires and in this case its just a rare case of it breaking at least 1 line of containment. Heck there is even a protocol for dispatch if I remember correctly 1-2 calls will bring like 2 fire engines,btohqsg
wtf gukesh is only 1 yr older than me,btohqsg
Idk about SCDF protocols but err the logistics is interesting I think the incident commander is universal in that the first battalion chief that reaches the scene is designated that first,btohqsg
Usually for large fires it may require mutiple engines from different stations so there is a need to have 1 guy make the decisions,btohqsg
But that decision maker has to decide how to fight the fire,btohqsg
If there's factors like ppl inside or idk industrial material like gasoline which err is not kind to fires,btohqsg
They would be a need for a offensive approach,btohqsg
I think SCDFs workhorse is the pump ladder for fire engines,btohqsg
U gotta establish water access as well from hydrants the 2.4k Liters of water will be gone in minutes at full flow,btohqsg
That's the tank of the engine..,btohqsg
No hydrants have a flow rate to replenish the tank,btohqsg
Bro the amount of water needed to fight fires is like... a lot,btohqsg

In a full building fire? That will be gone in 5 mins,btohqsg
Bro this is also why if u fucked with properly made sprinklers u don't have to worry about fire.. but u might have to worry about drowning.,btohqsg
Ok.. some old buildings build before fire codes are let's just say not up to standard so for those instances legit to make up for it they install sprinklers with a very high flow rate,btohqsg
Cuz ideally the sprinklers are a additional line of defense oni,btohqsg
The main goal is to contain the fire. Either to a room or to a floor and not the let it spread,btohqsg
Ventilation ducts and windows must adhere to building codes so for those that funnel into wall space it must maintain the same level of fire resistance than just the wall itself,btohqsg
Also it helps that our buildings are all made of solid steel reinforced rebar concrete,btohqsg
Just for penetrations alone the code takes up like 70 pages,btohqsg
Hey it is this code that makes it so and why that everytime you see a HDB fire it is almost always confined to the unit alone,btohqsg
If u think about it its kinda astonishing that we are able to compartmentalise and contain fires,btohqsg
Yeah bruh our fire suppression and fighting is so good now I think the advise when a fire is ongoing in your building is to just stay in your unit💀,btohqsg
U panic all rush down will choke and open doors allowing for the fire to spread.,btohqsg
Siao no la only those in imminent danger,btohqsg
Ya la the most same floor leave and that's about it,btohqsg
I think since SG got like damn high rise buildings there is also something called Refuge floors whereby got extra concrete build between the levels to further prevent spread,btohqsg
Fk we haven't learnt warehouse fire yet,btohqsg
Optimal flow rate is 34 litres per sec,btohqsg
They’re still legal tender tho so matcha can give all 1 cents and that notes girl can’t say she wasn’t paid lol,btohqsg
I have a few 1 cent coins at home,btohqsg
Unfortunately I only have less than 5,btohqsg
The cost of sending matcha those coins would be more than the value of the coins :(,btohqsg
Might as well pay in a different currency,btohqsg
How sia isnt that phased out p long ago,btohqsg
Yeah but I somehow have some lying around,btohqsg
Is my bp that low sia  idk why when i wear mask and walk  i will get giddy / headache,btohqsg
Meanwhile I have the exact opposite problem,btohqsg
Meanwhile i hate coins…so sometimes i will end up getting coins as change coz i lazy find my coins to give the store,btohqsg
maybe cuz u cant breathe properly?,btohqsg
And aso in the airport t1 the waiting area is damn narrow  i will get giddy,btohqsg
Can just put your small change into a vending machine when you get a lot,btohqsg
Most of them will not refund the same coins you put in but in larger denominations,btohqsg
The freaking train is damn crowded,btohqsg
My mum be like ‘then dun wear mask’,btohqsg
Yeah but at least since most stalls will just round up to nearest 10 cents I barely have to deal with those,btohqsg
I think it has something to do w blood circulation (same as the pins n needles shit),btohqsg
Like mask is just an obstacle there,btohqsg
Yesterday i got giddy when i entered the train,btohqsg
I also think now I keep getting urti/flu symptoms is because of those stupid ppl who are sick but don’t wear masks on public transport,btohqsg
I think if i no seats i would hv fainted,btohqsg
I see ppl coughing but dun wear mask also,btohqsg
Like during covid I pretty much didn’t catch any cold/flu for 2 years because everyone was wearing masks and practising social distancing,btohqsg
Like dude they cant make the freaking public transport so suffocating,btohqsg
it is better than jpn tho  where they squeeze people into the train,btohqsg
I would never pay cash directly on the bus since it’s so much more expensive,btohqsg
even go 1 stop  i checked it was 75¢ wtf,btohqsg
Oh ya cash bus fares still can be  in multiples of 5 cents,btohqsg
During my pri sch time bus fare was 55 cents for students,btohqsg
Then I think it got increased to 65,btohqsg
yo the lighting at airport rn is amazing,btohqsg
i got the best angle for photos,btohqsg
but nobody to take pics of,btohqsg
