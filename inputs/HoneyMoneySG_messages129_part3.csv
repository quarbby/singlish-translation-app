Thanks for the updates! What cc would u suggest to use for travel related expenses from 1 Oct onwards  able to pair with amaze..,btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to amaze and I‚Äôm pairing with Uob krisflyer. Just want to check  if I spend on local dining  I will give my amaze card and not Uob krisflyer right? And I saw some video saying there‚Äôs a cap or something for local spend. Plus the 3 mpd uncapped and it says online travel  so if I book travel by Expedia  I will need to check out by amaze instead of krisflyer right?,btohqsg
what u mean by travel related? online/offline? local/overseas?,btohqsg
You don't have to use amaze for local dinning with UOB Krisflyer.Only shopping with UOB Krisflyer needs to be online.There is no cap for UOB Krisflyer.,btohqsg
I see. So I only use amaze for overseas dining. How about booking from Expedia  I use Uob krisflyer or amaze since it says needs to be ‚Äúonline‚Äù travel,btohqsg
1. uob excluding Amaze wef 1 Oct2. use uob krisflyer directly for dining and expedia,btohqsg
I just gotten my amaze and waiting for my Uob krisflyer. Seems this is bad news. Looks like amaze got no more use?,btohqsg
After 1 Oct  amaze is only useful for CRMC.That's my opinion.,btohqsg
Oh I see thank you for your help,btohqsg
Everything.. online  offline and overseas... Ya... Like quite limited,btohqsg
U register now. Your reference month is July 2024.,btohqsg

Hello! Is there any credit card that can provide cashback/rewards/miles for buying SimplyGo adult concession. Because most credit cards exclude wallet top up including SimplyGo,btohqsg
the max interest for sep should be 4.4%  instead of 3.4% stated on the site right ü§î 3.35 + 0.05 + 1%,btohqsg
1% is a totally separate mechanic from this 3.x%,btohqsg
previous months always include the 1% though,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt matter whether they word it as 3.4 or 4.4.What‚Äôs in the individual component tnc is what matters,btohqsg
eg. august 4.70% = 3.65 + 0.05 + the other 1%,btohqsg
ya hopefully it‚Äôs just a typo,btohqsg
"Sorry.. i am bit confused on this term""For example  if the customer has already registered for the August Everyday GlobalAccount Bonus Interest Promotion then he/she will not be eligible to register for this Promotion."" Am worried becos my human2 has sent the sms for Aug promo..So far.. I have sent sms for both human every month. And alternate the fund (via 3rd party bank) and do the 5+1 transactions. Will my fund still eligible for the 3.3+1 this month?",btohqsg
If u sent SMS every month for human A. Human A will only qualify for the 2 months in that first registration.When u are in a cycle  any registration for a new cycle will be invalid.,btohqsg
