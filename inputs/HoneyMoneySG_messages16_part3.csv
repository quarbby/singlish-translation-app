GIRO = manual papereGiro = paperless via online (super limited merchants),btohqsg
Does anyone have solution for  this issue,btohqsg
Did u just get your cmrc card?,btohqsg
Then you have to be patient. Get your Citi rewards physical card  activate them  then you can use it either cmrc and/or insta amaze card,btohqsg
As of now  you cannot use your card till you get your physical card,btohqsg
What‚Äôs amaze cards? For what purpose de ty,btohqsg
Thank you  more for oversea spending lol,btohqsg
I link it to temporary card though,btohqsg
Once linked to credit card  just top up to wallet and can start using?,btohqsg
Yes  the security issue is from Citi Bank. Your limit using the temporary card has exceeded. You can only continue using your Citibank card once you received your physical card,btohqsg
Don't need top up. Just use the instarem once linked,btohqsg
Ohokay thanks lol I spend like less then 200sgd only,btohqsg
"Same issue occured to me. Citibank told me card was declined because of this""As per checking  your transaction has been declined due to digitally viewed transaction count limit exceeded. Means that you needs to activate the physical card for usage and cannot use the digital card anymore.""",btohqsg
