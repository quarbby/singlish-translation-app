Sorry cause the way they announce the mission timing very confusing and not that clear.,btohqsg
1. Accept order (within mission timing) before mission timing starts = wont count in the app and will be recalculated on Tuesday and direct credit to wallet.2. Accept order during mission timing = will count. but need to manually press redeem on the app when its available.,btohqsg

At the moment  evs are car parts attached to a giant expensive battery. They will costs less than ICE cars when the battery prices come down.,btohqsg
This is the best layman explanation I've heard all yearüòÖ,btohqsg
And yes they do have far lower complexity than the current cars,btohqsg
The switch to eV actually causing massive job losses coz the cars are so much simpler.,btohqsg
