IT MAY NOT BE THE FASTEST  BUT IT SURE IS THE BEST SOUNDING AND SUPER RELIABLE,btohqsg
I don’t agree with the price lah but,btohqsg
I am sure this car kena major accident before,btohqsg
And they took 3 months to settle my car loan to and to do owner transfer,btohqsg
All this while they have my car,btohqsg
Test drove my car without me,btohqsg
I think i told you this before when I took your rickshaw,btohqsg
so ur car pass to them,btohqsg
u no car for 3 months,btohqsg
then they started to sell ur car to potential customers?,btohqsg
Oh i bought another right after,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking,btohqsg
That way they can reduce their own cost,btohqsg
That's why I have never sold to dealer before.. consigned each of my cars until sold then buy the next,btohqsg
Or sell to dealer and transfer+settle loan on handover day,btohqsg
But Porsche on a different level.,btohqsg
So what 3.0 were you comparing to?,btohqsg
Too many shady ones with funny excuses,btohqsg

What if someone bring down a 1340cc  four-cylinder  DOHC engine vehicle with a weight of 264 kg come race.,btohqsg
dont say so fast  subaru piang faster,btohqsg
Sir do you mean a Hayabusa?,btohqsg
That is not a car sir,btohqsg
Weight and class no FACTOR mah.,btohqsg
Also you only need 600cc to beat a rocco,btohqsg
The group’s not the same without him,btohqsg
Maybe he was otw to Thailand in his x6m at 250+ and finally got there,btohqsg
