COE is a necessary evil. We hate to pay for it  but there is no alternative to capping vehicle population. the only debatable thing is how do we assign coes to people fairly. govt chooses a bidding system,btohqsg

I only able to find this and the others are all under warrantyService IntervalsYour vehicle should generally be serviced on an as-needed basis. However  Tesla recommends the following maintenance items and intervals  as applicable to your vehicle  to ensure continued reliability and efficiency of your Model 3.Brake fluid health check every 2 years (replace if necessary).A/C desiccant bag replacement every 6 years.Cabin air filter replacement every 2 years.Clean and lubricate brake calipers every year or 12 500 miles (20 000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during winterRotate tires every 6 250 miles (10 000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5 mm) or greater  whichever comes first,btohqsg
So just tether to your wifi and update.,btohqsg
Wa piang the cabin filter every 2Nyears then change?,btohqsg
Service must be cheap. Otherwise defeats purpose of having ev. Okay next car Tesla.,btohqsg
Just order online they sent to your home and can diy,btohqsg

companies that buy S plate cars shouldnt be allowed to join us in the usual CATs. they should have a join taxis,btohqsg
The main issue with ev is safety. Batteries that can catch fire. Scary. Like bolts,btohqsg
Or over charging that kind of thing,btohqsg
Avoid owning a car wherever possible. If you don‚Äôt really need to use it don‚Äôt buy it,btohqsg
Unless you need to commute between singapore malaysia,btohqsg

Pi servicing can be change oil only also counts as servicing. Ad is a lot more expensive but they have an extensive list of what they will chfck and replace. In fact  best case is to find the AD list of checks then bring to your own workshop,btohqsg
I get my workshop to list the break down of the checks done,btohqsg
True enough but would they be transparent? They could tell u 30pts check but how detailed ? LOL. Stand there and see how they check? Hmmm,btohqsg
