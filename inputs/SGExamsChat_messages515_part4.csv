cos my sch notes is like 1 say steady state the other is open,btohqsg
do you know what those terms mean?,btohqsg
steady state is mass enter and leave at the same flow rate,btohqsg
there is constant mass where mass in = mass out,btohqsg
both energy and mass can flow in and out,btohqsg
for those 3 processes by rite it should be steady state cos they all use the continuity equation,btohqsg
so just from that  open systems can be steady state and non steady state,btohqsg
steady state just requires this specific condition,btohqsg
