$1 just a starting fare   afterwards will adjust to reasonable amount,btohqsg
Oh!! That's how it looks like..learnt something new today . really appreciate your explanation üôè,btohqsg
It‚Äôs charity work like our friend say,btohqsg
Bro Have you do your charity yet for today ?,btohqsg
Today go for dinner . No charity,btohqsg
Really? No charity to do? Go eat some good food,btohqsg
Go back have dinner with family better,btohqsg
Then let them do the charity themselves,btohqsg
At least charity need some kopi money to enjoy kopi,btohqsg
That day I saw a few people waiting for leftover food at lau pat sat during lunch time ..they took them to eat,btohqsg
Yah... Now delivery personal all suffer with a lot of reduction,btohqsg
That one govt problem already.. they make citizens suffer...,btohqsg
I think Singapore really sink like titanic . I am seeing people taking left over food by others to feed themselves.,btohqsg
I felt like buy food for them. But .... Too many people paiseh,btohqsg
Work hard  make more money n the migrate liao.. future kids gonna suffer..,btohqsg
Do good no need paiseh wan..,btohqsg
Got bal 4 jobs.. all pooling job.. nobody take.. ü§£,btohqsg
They do this pooling fee job really ridiculous.,btohqsg
Those very cheap ones only foroll monks and nuns to do,btohqsg
Ps you see China monk anot,btohqsg
But I know some people took those pooling also faster send . Spoil market gao lat,btohqsg
No wonder the pooling price now even worse,btohqsg
Yes today I called one pooling job after I accepted   told customer I will only pick up within 2hrs n deliver within 4hrs   client said other drivers can do immediately  I said then she can go ahead cancel me n try her luck again. ü•¥,btohqsg
She is right too . Someone will do it no matter how fk up the price is,btohqsg
knn use pooling service but ask to deliver asap.. how like tht?,btohqsg
People still do it what to do,btohqsg
Sometimes they're just work for the money.. they need income to feed family.. not everyone had enough right.. so when do pooling jobs  we can't judge them.. everyone needs to survive..,btohqsg
Totally understand that‚Äôs why the price is like this . Have to accept it,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt blame the price at all,btohqsg
Not everyone has silver spoon to feed them   Times are tough.. let's just be reasonable to one another.. as we all working to feed each other's own family..,btohqsg
Blame LLM for this stupid pooling system. But still they taking the same percentage for their platform,btohqsg
Workers suffe when they're just suck out everything from us.,btohqsg
I have nothing against the pooling amount because I don‚Äôt take it . End of the day the price is because they know even low price people will still take as you said,btohqsg
That's true.. nothing much can be done.. unless  everyone dares to boycott for few days without taking order in llm platform..,btohqsg
This will happen when LLM is gone haha,btohqsg
I mean if pooling is that bad . You can actually wait awhile don‚Äôt have to rush to take like some one will snatch that deal from you . You are the one making customer feel we are cheap,btohqsg
Maybe there's no choice for them.. so they just take the orders. As for me  as much I can avoid taking pooling service. I will avoid. Rather take up credit job than pooling..,btohqsg
I will only call to confirm. If she doesn‚Äôt ask how long it takes to deliver. I keep quiet. If she calls me to ask  while her items with me. Then I will tell them and show them the relevant screenshots of ‚Äúpooling‚Äù. Only way to teach them. Let it affect my ratings  but I‚Äôll ‚Äútake one for the team‚Äù. Let them learn the hard way.,btohqsg
Yeah.. that happens to me yesterday too.. I show them screenshot.. customer just reply ok.. ü§£,btohqsg
Bo pian. What else can they do? We have their items mahh? As best they can do is complain lor? Like I give a damn. üòÖ,btohqsg
As long as I am compliant with LLM T&C  I am not violating anything. If anything they are violating LLM. ü§£,btohqsg
In the end of the day  we doing the right thing as implemented by llm.. so not our fault.. üòÅ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to be scared if we‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. So long as we follow the protocols set by LLM  our arses are safe. ü§≠,btohqsg
may everyone return home safely after a day of hard work üôèüòä,btohqsg
Regarding about Van job  understand that customer book a van is driver responsibility to bring up item door to door service for the base fare of $32  if there is a lot of item  may I know what u guy will do?,btohqsg
Ask them move themself. U only deliver. Else pay extra lor,btohqsg
But ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù means deliver to doorstep  it‚Äôs still within the job scope as a courier to deliver to doorstep no matter how many items or how heavy UNLESS the delivery exceeds the limit. Then again if exceed  you shouldn‚Äôt be delivering it in the first place. What is not part of the job scope is installation  moving the items into the house  help storing etc.,btohqsg
Yah.. this week the orders abit jialat..,btohqsg
