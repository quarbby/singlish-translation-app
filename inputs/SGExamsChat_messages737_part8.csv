ok even though yijc and mi have bad repsat the end of the day  they are approved by moe to teach the A levels syllabusif there is something seriously wrong with them  moe would have intervened by nowWhile these schools dont have the best rep  they are adequate to fit the needs of students,btohqsg
thats the students issue not the school,btohqsg
having a bad rep does not give one the right to claim they deserve to be shat on,btohqsg
the amount of reddit posts about yijc for the past few weeks is actually insane,btohqsg
and they are all negative stuff,btohqsg
yea and so your source of info is...reddit?,btohqsg
And whatever sch it is  im sure no school is 100%  i just silently live with whatever,btohqsg
i mean the students there do seem like they have issues based on what ive been seeing on discord as well,btohqsg
wait did someone else tag me abt some gp thingy,btohqsg
By global standards like what kuro said maybe if not over here nah,btohqsg
some person keeps on saying for weeks on end that the majority of the people in yijc do not give a single shit about school and argue back at teachers,btohqsg
not my words by the way,btohqsg
ngl ppl with no problems and perfect sch life wont complain online,btohqsg
she finds every opportunity to shit on yijc,btohqsg
That is very and overly generalised,btohqsg
but why would they lie about it lol,btohqsg
i mean i wont be surprised,btohqsg
he has an apt in tanjong rhu apparantly,btohqsg
if someone was having a good time at yijc they wont complain,btohqsg
who? i dont pay attention to the name,btohqsg
and drives a 6 seater car to camp,btohqsg
those 2 yijcians on discord literally just,btohqsg
