5.smth mile per dollar for the spend category if i calculated correctly  or does it not work that way,btohqsg
5.56mpd for KF conversion  but you've to cash out in 10k miles block.Not sure if you're able to clock $1.8k on those very specific merchants or not.If you eat a lot of fast food or toasts and/or primarily use this card for BUS/MRT*  maybe can ba over 3 years span (approx $50 spend per month),btohqsg
7.68mpd for KF is no more. Now left with 5.56mpd.,btohqsg

"Hi guys  can i confirm that if i have debit card with uob and a savings account but no credit cards so far  will i be considered as ""new to card"" for uob?",btohqsg
no you‚Äôre an existing user if i understand correctly,btohqsg
There's a difference between new to card and new to bank if i compare the terms?,btohqsg
if you‚Äôre talking abt signup bonuses  i think having any sort of uob cards will exclude u,btohqsg
Ah i see...even if its a debit?,btohqsg
Recommended card to use for mcc7011?,btohqsg
Bank (debit) and credit card centre are separate entities. You should be new to cc. Why not call up hotline to confirm.,btohqsg
On 1st Jan 2024  u have the opportunity to do 3k topup (assuming you already hit BHS). Once MA is maxed  cpf from salary will flow into SA instead of MA  supercharging your SA component.,btohqsg
If I top up start of the year  will be eligible for tax relief next year as well right?,btohqsg
It depends on your current financial situation.  Do you have any high interest debt to clear? How long is your investment timeline where you don't need to touch this 500k ? What is your risk appetite?,btohqsg
Tax relief will be for your income earned in 2024.. it will be assessed in 2025.,btohqsg
You can also top up MA whenever there is any insurance deduction  up to 8K a year for tax relief.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  for the EGA bonus interest campaign  is it ok for someone else other than the account holder to perform the SMS registration on her/his behalf? Or must send from HSBC registered phone number?https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/products/everyday-global/hsbc-ega-bonus-interest-promotion-tc.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi8koC1l7aDAxXycmwGHRB5B0YQFnoECBIQBg&usg=AOvVaw2tJslpV2F-wUkAxZLM7NYC,btohqsg
I will go with amundi. The ishare one is synthetic  meaning the fund dont hold the underlying shares. I dunno what is the implication of it in case there are any financial shenanigans  so i will jus pay a little extra in fee for the amundi one.,btohqsg
When will this get updated? Any way to know that i did correctly?,btohqsg
It is updated now. About 5 mins,btohqsg
Yes  within 1 min. Or re-login it will be updated,btohqsg

Hi  I want to sign up the Trust saving acct for the $50 ntuc welcome voucher. Does anyone knows what is the minimum deposit and any T&C ?.,btohqsg
My OCBC average daily balance increase is $796 as of 29 Dec. I calculated if I want to bring it down to $500  I have to withdraw $296x29 divided by 2 (remaining 2 days of the month) = 4292. So much??,btohqsg
Yes  hotel booking qualifies for the min spend to get the sign up reward. You will  however  not get the 10x points from Jan onwards,btohqsg
Not sure about UOB. But yes for DBS. Would think it‚Äôs the same across the banks,btohqsg
does the withdrawal amount depends on the bid price on 2 Jan  net of all fees ?,btohqsg
Hi all  question on UOB one bonus interest rates. It requires me to hit $500 spent on selected credit card. Does card up contribute towards this $500 spent? (just going for interest  not the uob one credit card cash rebate),btohqsg
