Okay  so you’re a 2nd timer upon applying for the SBF.,btohqsg
It will be 2nd timer for SBF?,btohqsg
it's only after rejected the appointment twice  then will auto become 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
Shld be still first timer. There is two chances,btohqsg
Glitches on HDB’s website on sale of BTO flats launch day  work in progress to resolve issuesThe Housing and Development Board (HDB) said that applicants with unsuccessful payment records or those who did not receive any confirmation email “are advised to try again later”.HDB stressed that the sales exercise is “on for a week” and interested buyers may submit their applications before 11.59pm on Nov 23.➡️https://tdy.sg/3lI6GBq@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
im getting a lot of instances of '502 Bad Gateway: Your request has been received  but there is no valid response from the server.' what can i do about this?,btohqsg
Yea. Their server overwhelmed i guess,btohqsg
Took me 2 hrs to complete the application 😂,btohqsg
Anyone here knows about HLE? Can it be extended or if expire only can reapply?,btohqsg
Yea mine expired but extended due to covid till end of this mth only,btohqsg
Hi i am currently still waiting to see if my number will be called for the previous bto exercise as its bigger than available units. Am i able to ballot for the current SBF as well?,btohqsg
Anyone got updated  to the construction progress  for jewel bto  at jurong  west?,btohqsg
Can see for sbf flats as well?,btohqsg
Does anyone have development update on the Canberra Vista,btohqsg
Is it possible for me to ballot for both sales of balance flats and a BTO flat for this launch? Or only one choice? 😅,btohqsg
haha no prob. I had the same dilemma,btohqsg
Any idea when Urbanville will enter SBF?,btohqsg
Where to check the progress of current BTO,btohqsg
see whether can you wait for 7 years despite 95% chance for first timers,btohqsg
or decide it upon checking the application rate status on 23rd Nov  11pm,btohqsg
then do calculation on your finance since waiting time for SBF is much much faster,btohqsg
example do you want to BTO for bidadari and wait 7 years (95% chance and can slowly build up your $) or wait for SBF (much Lower chance but wait for 7 months and need to have ample of savings to tank the payment),btohqsg
Biddari bto waiting time is 7 years ?,btohqsg
I mean in general for recent BTO launches due to covid,btohqsg
Any idea how to check how long will the bto I want to apply for takes to build ?,btohqsg
How to go to this page ?,btohqsg
Sian sia my birthday was the day right after the end of Aug bto Exercise,btohqsg
No ah. 3 or 4rm depending on $$$,btohqsg
My family is renting HDB from HDB. So i can bto without getting married.,btohqsg
Thanks ! Wanna know when will sbf be out for Feb 2021 launch?,btohqsg
Wait u want to sbf for something that hasnt even come out?,btohqsg
What I understand was sbf will be twice a year - May/Nov. If you are asking when bto will launch in Feb 2021  then you may wanna monitor during Feb because sales launch release date will varies across different years.,btohqsg
Morning everyone! Is it true that 95% of flats in mature estates is given to first time applicants?,btohqsg
So for bishan 4 room flats  1160 out of 1222 flats go to first time applicants?,btohqsg
I’m wondering if I should look at first time applicants subscription rate or the overall subscription rate 🧐,btohqsg
u should just apply 1st ><,btohqsg
Thinking if we should apply 3 or 4 room for better chances 😅,btohqsg
but is it big enough for you?,btohqsg
especially you have more than one kid,btohqsg
4rm is always the hottest fav every BTO launch,btohqsg
I have a mother and a brother  can apply for 4rm using public scheme or i can only follow my Tenant Priority Scheme ah,btohqsg
Sbf 5rm Clementi can be 800k over - madness. 20 min walk from mrt some more,btohqsg
just curiousis SBF price higher than BTO?,btohqsg
you can refer to the application status of AMK the previous launch,btohqsg
