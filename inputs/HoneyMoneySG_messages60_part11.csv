The fixed deposit portion acts as a collateral. Minimum of 10k. Credit limit will be 80% of your fixed deposit.Once defaulted  they will use your fixed deposit as a repayment method.You will be able to use the money in the fixed deposit after closing the card  within a period of up to 30 days.Usually for people who can't hit the minimum income requirements or have bad credit rating.,btohqsg
