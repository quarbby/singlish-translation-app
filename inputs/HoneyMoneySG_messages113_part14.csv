Hi  I'm new to the miles game and have a renovation coming up  costing around $30k in three phases. I'm planning to sign up for the UOB PRVI Miles Card to pay for the renovation via CardUp and take advantage of the sign-up promo. Will the renovation payments be eligible for the 1.4 miles per dollar of local spend? I couldn't find the category for local spend. Alternatively  is there a better miles card for this purpose?Thanks in advanceüôèüôè,btohqsg

Hi guys. If i were to apply citi bank rewards card through singsaver for the dyson hair drier  do i still entitled for the 16k bonus miles from citibank,btohqsg
Before u jump into any program  u might want to see if the program work with airline u want to fly on first,btohqsg
Do you mean safe instead of save?,btohqsg
Safe to book through heymax agoda?,btohqsg
It is safe but have u check out heymax miles partner  minimum to transfer out  how long it take to credit and how long the miles last etc.Since mastercard is giving 12 percent discount  u are opting 4 heymax point for over 12 percent discount if your hotel is eligible so this is the opportunity cost i am talking about.,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs safe. But will the max miles earned be useful for you? Are you planning to redeem flights from FFPs other than Krisflyer?,btohqsg
Am I correct to get max point from heymax and uob lady card get the uni$ for booking agoda?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows about this üòÖ,btohqsg
Have u read the tnc for the promo  sometime can stack  sometime cant  each sign up promo is different,btohqsg
Ohhh i see  havent yet. I dont really know the procedure of applying using singsaver. Is it like writting a form  then apply the card normally with citibank? Or is it like they apply on ur behalve? Sry if my qns very simple qns,btohqsg
After checking 12% master card promo and heymax still cheaper by $1 + heymax point,btohqsg
Maybe coz i am vip for agoda and i use card like dbs wwmc (18 percent) instead of just mastercard (12 percent) so i usually see much better rate then my friend see coz i spilt booking due to promo cap,btohqsg
If u put multiple night together it might not be economical viable due to promo cap  what i do is i spilt day to maximise the discount. I searching on heymax and agoda mastercard page now and it end up cheaper for hotel for 1 night for same hotel/same date/same type,btohqsg
Not leh. I think got hsbc branch at Vietnam. I recently just open a hsbc account in vietnam. Although still in the mid of opening.Just that their money can only be transfer from sg hsbc to Vietnam hsbc. And money cannot be transferred back. Only one way. So only consumption purpose can be used. And very troublesome from what I know. Cannot even get their debit card. Only atm card are given.,btohqsg
Did try split day vs multiple night  for me I don't see cheaper. I guess maybe u are vip agoda that's why cheaper,btohqsg
I thought their debit card is same as ATM. Is bad .. cannot transfer back from hsbc vietnam to spore..,btohqsg
Asking for a friend any cards to recommend for dining now? Prefer cashback/rewards pts and low / none min spend monthly  is HSBC revolution still good for this purpose?,btohqsg
Citi crmc with amaze  uob ppv  hsbc revo all not minimum spending  just that hsbc and citi award in 1 dollar spending block while uob award in 5 dollar spending block  plenty of low cashback card at 1.6 so u just research your own,btohqsg
In my opinion. Hsbc is the best for dining restaurant.  Such as din tai feng  crystal jade  paradise restaurants  hai di lao. Imperials,btohqsg
Ok thanks i thinking of HSBC for my friend  low requirement  online offline also can except fast food,btohqsg
Fast food. Better to use citi rewards with amaze card,btohqsg
That what I heard from the RM. So not too sure 100%. Still in the mid of opening. Going next week to get the account successfully open.,btohqsg
One more. If you are seafood lover like jumbo restaurants or dancing crab... also using hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a question on UOB One Credit Card. For example  if I spend $500 (including insurance premiums)  am I still entitled for the 3.33% cash back?$500 minimum spend-$250 for insurance premium-$250 for retail spendingDo I still qualify 3.33% on my $250 worth of retail spending?,btohqsg
Bro. Wish you good luck in opening vietnam hsbc  hope you success,btohqsg
"Kind of different. At least I cannot use it online example grab or what. Only can use their internal Vietnam ""paynow"" etc for some vendor",btohqsg
Just realised agoda got different tier for vip  I'm only bronze tier and my friend is platinum  he gotta better deal then me. Same hotel same date,btohqsg
They don't have HSBC EGA. They have HSBC current account with SGD support.,btohqsg
Yes i told u haha   i save about 200 plus for 10 night using bank landing page and vip compare to my friend so i told her to let me book,btohqsg
I am value chaser  not miles chaser,btohqsg
I mean account. Not really sure is it ega account or not. Or any other benefit. I also won't be keeping much money in vietnam. Just for consumption purpose. And possible to open a Vietnam stock trading account. If in the future  prepare to invest at there.,btohqsg
I read wrong. But right now HSBC EGA don't support Viet dong. Next time maybe. ü§™,btohqsg
I mean their Vietnam hsbc. Of course will be denominated in vietnam dong. If sg hsbc no then.,btohqsg
Wonder why can't uob create their own right.. benefit all uob card users,btohqsg
HSBC EGA  register for the bonus interest promo and fulfill Everyday+ reward criteria to get 4.65% p.a.Can register this by 15 Jun and then deposit on 1 Jul.,btohqsg
But don't benefit them. They can do it but charge you 2%. Would you use?,btohqsg
