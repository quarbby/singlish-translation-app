See major servicing   then see got ev   take the plunge lol the arf 45 k rebate too good lioa,btohqsg
will online car buying be successful? bypassing dealers,btohqsg
it will be for all cars purchase,btohqsg
i dont want to deal with dealers,btohqsg
Cause alot of maintenance  manufacturers need hire a lot of ppl to do servicing,btohqsg
To me the value of an ad is due to servicing,btohqsg
Actually the cheapest Lexus more expensive then Mercedes hehe,btohqsg
Now too many a class   like gla and such,btohqsg
my relative drive Mercedes. he say maintainance very cheap. cos he always go jbüòÇ,btohqsg
maybe i should also invest in a odb2 gadget to enable me to do simpleoil change myself,btohqsg
Going back to ad asp can get software update   ev no such problem as it is all done thru the air,btohqsg
What type of Mercedes and where in jb hehe,btohqsg
e class convertible... what ws I duno...,btohqsg
How cheap is subjective to each and e class a lot of model from 200 to amg hehe,btohqsg
in Sg  drive conti go everywhere aso knife sharp sharp. u smart drive EV now. they no chance earn yr moneyüòÇ,btohqsg
I agree ... 1 million km is not a dream,btohqsg
Piece of cake for W123 diesel.,btohqsg
if only modern cars remove all the electronics sensors n turbo. they can last very long too,btohqsg
Unless gov stops slapping ridiculous road taxes on cars with no emissions... I'll still be reluctant to switch,btohqsg
It's sad tbh  gov is NATO,btohqsg
I would welcome this change. Some ADs are too shady alr. Given all those markups.,btohqsg
Definitely. Conflicting policies on sustainable transportation.,btohqsg
I like how it is your answer for many things hahaha.,btohqsg
i dont beat around the bush,btohqsg
Either we are early adopters or just stick to ICE alr,btohqsg
Sir not just simply engine oil lahhhh. Most peasants gao dim engine oil change for $20-25/L engine oil needed. Maybe your BMW is mega large engine cc one. Drive ICE time also smoking everyone,btohqsg
Ohhhhh‚Ä¶ good luck to that. All controlled liao.,btohqsg
German minimalism. Plain and simple like Tesla interior mah,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the best. See how the prices are appreciating now.,btohqsg
100% I‚Äôm for it. Times have changed,btohqsg
Buy direct and source your own loans insurance,btohqsg
Best model I hope that future ADs or whatever can adopt.,btohqsg
No haggling or prices. No hidden costs,btohqsg
I see the receipt is just changing engine oil lol,btohqsg
Like Tesla direct sales business model,btohqsg
But then who bids for coe,btohqsg
They give u a form to choose   increase 20% or 5% or stay same,btohqsg
Used real 3 now at what price,btohqsg
Sg car mart got a lot ar,btohqsg
all similar pricing  alot of ppl think it will depreicate alot  but actually no,btohqsg
Right now market around the world is such that it is hard for Tesla to depreciate,btohqsg
Most new units or barely used units selling at the same price or profit,btohqsg
In Singapore the higher COE and limited supply really help this as well,btohqsg
How‚Äôs the reliability? What is the part that‚Äôs most unreliable,btohqsg
cause the basic cost is high  as there i sno dealer mark up  and whole world out of stock,btohqsg
this model is very intreasting  as the car is just basic cost,btohqsg
but the 2nd hand is good for ppl wanted full loan  as tesla dont entertain,btohqsg
so 2nd hand car dealer is very happy,btohqsg
You mean only cash is allowed to buy new? From Tesla,btohqsg
No la is the standard goverment policy 40% down payment   they don‚Äôt have $0 drive away scheme,btohqsg
good perspective.  How come suddenly so many for sale so soon after the 1st owner has driven them.,btohqsg
There are already 1000 plus new tesla already   the wait now is model y,btohqsg
Some of them are under dealers,btohqsg
SG Car choice that one you scroll down,btohqsg
Is actually the 72 hour test drive car that they provide,btohqsg
can be so misleading when it only says engine oil change for $500+.  Sounds likely that more was done/changed during that routine servicing visit.  it is very misleading otherwise for people to walk away thinking $500+ needed for pure engine oil change when engine oil probably costs closer to only $20-25/L that kind of range.  For a 2.0L 4-cyl engine  the amount of engine oil needed is probably around 5L max?,btohqsg
They also have the 72 point check ma   and food for you to eat and car wash,btohqsg
I wonder why we would want to go thru SG Car Choice if we can source our own via the website..,btohqsg
They help u book online and help u on loan,btohqsg
Orh I see.. but insurance don‚Äôt need to go thru them la?,btohqsg
I only know ppl find them is because of loan ba,btohqsg
2.0L engine can use up to 6.5L depending on your car/engine,btohqsg
Market ma got demand that why got such service,btohqsg
... and they say Singaporeans don't think outside the box and are text book people hahaha.  It is actually an item which would not be found in most manufacturer maintenance manuals.  One contributor to wear and tear in Singapore is the high cycle  short distance city driving that most of us do.  Jet spraying hot mechanicals parts will subject them to increased stress actually.,btohqsg
That's a very expensive lunch then I guess  even if you factor in 72 point check at the most not more than 100 dollars because mostly just check via obd and regular physical inspection which most mechanics do FOC,btohqsg
you really wouldn't want alternator and sensors to go because of water. or pushing dirt deeper into belts.,btohqsg
They will offer you a quote similar to that offered by the TOSG group deal so that they can earn the commission,btohqsg
Ad selling service and expertise   and they don‚Äôt force me to go also   I just go 1 time before I sell car and do a software update that is free,btohqsg
i wouldn't do it unless it is to clean up a huge mess from leaking oils etc.,btohqsg
you are a wise man Mr Arnav.,btohqsg
I still can't stomach $500 only for engine oil change  would rather go elsewhere and do and use the saved money for an even better lunch outside. Can get similar or sometimes better expertise than AD outside since many ADs these days see a problem and just change parts  don't try to find the issue  as the SAs have sales targets and billing amounts to meet also,btohqsg
so there's no free lunch in this world.  in which case  I'd rather eat economy fried bee hoon  and watch what I am charged for engine oil.  That difference will buy me a lot of 'free' bee hoon.,btohqsg
market ma  willing buyer willing seller,btohqsg
some ppl willing to pay for the service,btohqsg
I believe the amount will actually include other tasks to be accurate. will most likely not be simply isolated to only engine oil change.,btohqsg
Other task being rich people tax,btohqsg
Ad pricing really like such 1 haha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs if you spray very hot.engine is best washed and cleaned if it‚Äôs warm. I‚Äôve been fling this more nearly 20 years,btohqsg
i don't necessarily disagree that AD pricing is higher but hard to agree that simply engine oil change costs $500 on a 2.0L engine Lexus.,btohqsg
it is almost misleading because I have serviced cars at ADs before and it would include other tasks.,btohqsg
While we know ADs earn a margin  and many of us still buy from there for quality assurance  warranty  nice facilities etc etc and those factor are hard to replace  we should still try to be fair and not make sweeping/general statements against them  otherwise everyone will just be like me: a bored coffee shop uncle.,btohqsg
Yes they include wear n tear checks and wash vacuum which is kinda standard for most ADs,btohqsg
Anyway if the owner can afford to service there  and lazy to find cheaper place it is their prerogative,btohqsg
there a premium package also  like 3-4 time serrvicing i forger liao,btohqsg
quite a number of ppl bought it,btohqsg
don't worry about forgetting.  Luckily everything is online these days. üòÅ,btohqsg
wah so many oils  fluids  filters  gaskets etc replaced during the AD servicing package,btohqsg
hopefully in today's time  ADs and workshops all become more transparent and tell us consumers exactly what they are doing on our cars.,btohqsg
The Audi RS3 is a compact sports car like no otherThe RS3 is a car that is ready for the track and also a perfect daily for the streetsüî•üëâüèª React with üî• if you are a fan of the new Audi RS3!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
heng I used cheap oil from SPC. Now leaking oil also don't feel heartpain.Just dont fine me for my car peeing whenever it is parked. üôà,btohqsg
eh AC condensation is peeing... leak oil is macam bleeding already unker,btohqsg
some of the more savvy owners I know even buy their on parts on internet and go to their trusted ws to just pay labour.,btohqsg
environment of course not so nice lah but they get what is needed done.,btohqsg
it is just paying for service lol  u ask those ppl drive back maserati and such back to do servicing the cost,btohqsg
as long as the oil grade / viscosity used is correct,btohqsg
Old car is 20W-50. No brainer. HahaBest it is API SF rated. Good for older cars without üò∫,btohqsg
like middleman. Benz in Sg will be much  cheaper without markup by C&C..the middleman,btohqsg
the fancy show room  and such also do a part in the costing,btohqsg
hahaha then there's so much variety to choose from.,btohqsg
u go tesla sg haha u get a shock,btohqsg
agreed. someone's gonna be paying for all that glitz.,btohqsg
It look like a ware house to me,btohqsg
I going back for tyre rotation,btohqsg
now still richest? share shrink by half,btohqsg
do you mean where you do servicing?,btohqsg
AD different coz sales and service centers often located together wor,btohqsg
Tesla's Millenia Walk showroom so beautifulll!!!!,btohqsg
Lucky I go Teban Gardens often.. can go drool at Cycle sometimes.,btohqsg
Touch touch sit sit  then go online to buy üëè,btohqsg
The Tesla sales model can only work for them cause options are limited in terms of models and equipment  basically only choose between a few paint options  all different colours so don't need to compare in person  very few interior colours  and FSD or not.,btohqsg
For ICE cars  especially many contis  there's a lot of options one can choose and for that they need to be able to see units with stuff equipped,btohqsg
Secondly  with many brands  you're not just buying the car  you're buying the badge and the service and reputation that comes with it  for this having a dealership and experience centre is important,btohqsg
For example  if one is buying a rolls Royce  would you rather go to the dealer and use the atelier to option and spec up your car feeling all the materials in person  having an appointed sales person to help you through the process  or sit in front of your screen and try to order and end up choosing the wrong shade of white,btohqsg
ohhhhh no wonder all look so similar. I thought it's coz they all love that same combi which is actually ok lah.,btohqsg
If buying a new car  most consumers want to go through that entire process and get all the attention and perks of it which only a dealer with a physical location can offer. Those just looking to save money and don't want these can go buy used ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
And I guess going to non-ADs one basically usually just get whatever they have on stock with more limited choice of colours  options etc etc.,btohqsg
Yupp  like those going to PIs,btohqsg
i gotta say some of AD new car delivery experience I have seen are quite awesome and can see the effort they are putting in.,btohqsg
Indeed  many really try to make it the best day of your life and rightfully so  one has worked hard to save and spend on an expensive car!,btohqsg
Tesla sell car like sell phone,btohqsg
just that your phone probably wouldn't be delayed for 2 years üòú,btohqsg
It is for them to mass produce car as fast as possibleAs too many orders,btohqsg
Model y from Germany by right April come 1 now delay to next year,btohqsg
streamlining is a good industrial move.,btohqsg
in the grand scheme of things  it is really amazing how the established manufacturers do it,btohqsg
with the larger volume and differentiated models they are making these days,btohqsg
thought their china factory was hyped to be the factory of the future when it first came out,btohqsg
Now seems that they are opening another giga factory in Indonesia,btohqsg
sg should ask Tesla build factory here.,btohqsg
That 1 do model 3   Berlin is model y,btohqsg
add on more customisability for the models as well  so many combinations and options offered and so many powertrain/drive options,btohqsg
future not future. present not present.,btohqsg
thought still in talks. nothing confirmed yet?,btohqsg
So there will be alot of tesla charger in nshw hahahaha,btohqsg
A great example would be the f150 platform of ford  8 variants available with trim levels for each variant plus options,btohqsg
Then I can burn my carbon,btohqsg
so keyword is.. in talks to I guess but nothing confirmed. twit fodder,btohqsg
Ya la hopping la I belong to unicorn club,btohqsg
even with delays  nvm nvm.. one download and play driving on phone first. free software update assured.,btohqsg
Ya haha nshw is so fun,btohqsg
With tesla sc really don‚Äôt need to save energy by not flooring liao,btohqsg
Hi any one knows where can I get myself a TnG card in singapore,btohqsg
except once they start charging for charging,btohqsg
Got charger is important   charging so cheap lol,btohqsg
True that too. I hope they will invest in more around.,btohqsg
Stagflation is in. Don‚Äôt spend $500 oil change bros,btohqsg
I bought salmon from song fish from this year $38 a unit now is 45 a unit,btohqsg
Ktv also now beer line 288 for 3 tower,btohqsg
How much you guys spend on fuel a month,btohqsg
Is shake shack now more expensive,btohqsg
wonder how those ppl like in mlysia survive...the price of stuff in jb is almost like in sg,btohqsg
During pandemic period just $150/mth since no need to go back office. üòÇ,btohqsg
Rising cost of food  utilities  transport a growing concern for low-income familieshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rising-cost-of-food-utilities-transport-a-growing-concern-for-low-income-families,btohqsg
Poor no need to worry much. Gov will help them with vouchers.,btohqsg
They survived better than us. Sgreans go there to eat restaurants not homecooked food.,btohqsg
Down here we eat cai png better than cook own food. üòÖ,btohqsg
What is considered old car? 250k mileage?,btohqsg
My car is going 51 years old. lol,btohqsg
Vintage car. True passion to keep,btohqsg
So I should use 20-50 oil?,btohqsg
My ws still changing 5w-40 for me üò≥,btohqsg
Use whatever recommended by your manufacturer.,btohqsg
Cai Peng can be cheaper then home cook,btohqsg
One of my regret in life is not able to learn to cook Cai Peng and open a store,btohqsg
Exactly. $3 for one meal. No need to wash  just dispose the packets.,btohqsg
Eat meats will cost more. Easily hit $5 these days.,btohqsg
Yeah man. In many cases even more expensive than singapore. Chicken rice here is like rm18,btohqsg
This is definitely much more expensive than malaysia,btohqsg
You‚Äôre dreaming man. You think rm600 a year is enough?,btohqsg
10‚Äôyears old. Goes by age. Not mileage,btohqsg
I bet taxi drivers will want to be able to pump outside little red dot. üòÖ,btohqsg
The rise in gst will offset all the handouts,btohqsg
I think msia hands out are worse than sg lor,btohqsg
That‚Äôs just populous move to appease sinkies to vote,btohqsg
Sinkies won‚Äôt shake the boat too much.,btohqsg
Yeah in terms of food costs. Very high in Malaysia. Higher than singapore,btohqsg
Malaysian foods actually very expensive now,btohqsg
Really ah. In jb or some kampung place?,btohqsg
Actually maybe they up the prices because sgreans going in liao,btohqsg
Tea garden for instance and many cafes. Common now. Rm5.20. Oriental kopi,btohqsg
Many are now charging this. In singapore you can have it for 90 cents,btohqsg
Even in kulai car away it‚Äôs rm5.20,btohqsg
This is not atas place. This is just neighborhood food restaurant,btohqsg
Yes. Just like that type. Toastbox,btohqsg
Toastbox kopi where got 90cents then? üòÖ,btohqsg
No more 1RM roti canai alr? ü•≤,btohqsg
Everyone is charging high now. Why? Everyone knows online what others are charging. Even hawkers are charging high in Malaysia,btohqsg
In kl bakuteh is rm20 per person,btohqsg
This one can be more. Depending on the food,btohqsg
Malays made canai is a lot better than mamak ones,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say better than singkie versions,btohqsg
Ok. One exception in towns like Kluang you can have cheap coffee there. Rm2 only.,btohqsg
Ok. Kluang is the benchmark then,btohqsg
But then it‚Äôs one and half hour from Jb inner,btohqsg
Nobody goes there. Nothing to see,btohqsg
it's cheap but food outside is not exactly very good for body... they use recycled oil to cook the dishes...,btohqsg
Ermmm‚Ä¶ oily and salty i can understand the concern,btohqsg
I think we cannot use jb as benchmark for whole of msia,btohqsg
Just like we cannot compare cbd and neighbourhood food cost,btohqsg
want cheap u must drive at least 30 km away from custom... the price near custom is catered for sinkies,btohqsg
If you ever been to kelantan or Terengganu  that will be basically be some benchmarking,btohqsg
Their chendol only rm3 using good green stuffs not those with colorings.,btohqsg
I think most folks with cars go in look for petrol and car wash. ü§£,btohqsg
You must not compare this way. Because there will always be outliers. You got to compare with cititts,btohqsg
Yes. KL JB Klang pj Penang,btohqsg
Even in second tier cities like kulai extremely high too,btohqsg
I got friends migrated there. Or put it as back to his kampung üòÇ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt like Penang. Too many trees. Very spooky,btohqsg
Can do nice drive all days there,btohqsg
Got durians too which hardly deliver to sg,btohqsg
Ya lor. So many will go try when they are touring there.,btohqsg

OI imports but dont have to be registered,btohqsg
In general dealer stock can be unregistered for a while,btohqsg
i forgot the rules  can PI import NEW cars?,btohqsg
You can import your own self too,btohqsg
yes anyone can import. challenge is finding a workshop,btohqsg
if the amount is not big like in malayia  can take such risk,btohqsg
Not really  you can just go to any specialist,btohqsg
There was a time where many import used cars too.,btohqsg
Or better still  some import car but not registered to drive on sg roads,btohqsg
this i know. of course the outside one will take whatever. it is business to them,btohqsg
So the cost of ownerships is definitely lower,btohqsg
the dealer wont want to service your car,btohqsg
Depending on your worth i guess.,btohqsg
in malaysia  recon cars can be serviced by dealers. they dont care you dont buy from them,btohqsg
many diret import cars from japan are as good as new. ,btohqsg
the only problem in malayisa is you cannot do it yourself to import,btohqsg
you got to find a licensed importer with a AP,btohqsg
Can go to the AD also,btohqsg
For them it is business  they will just make you pay the full price no free service,btohqsg
Got money anything also can as long no crimes involved. üòù,btohqsg
they wont want to entertain at all,btohqsg
and would specify ridiculous price just so hat you cannot accuse them for not doing your car. this is how they deter you,btohqsg
"in malaysia  some dealers like Autobavaria (BMW top dealer) would charge rm20K to open ""account"". while 2nd tier dealers would not mind",btohqsg
Not too different  usually for ICE cars they can still work on them,btohqsg
Main differences can be the language that the obd reads in originally but that can be changed. Mechanically most of them are the same or similar,btohqsg
They do actually  take a PI Mercedes to c&c  they will be happy to service. Of course at a cost,btohqsg
Just that they will not offer their 10 year engine & gearbox warranty which is only offered if you buy and service with them,btohqsg
you are not treated equal. i already said they will charge you HIGH just aso you cannot complain to principle,btohqsg
they ill quote you so high you wont want to do it,btohqsg
Actually roughly the same price  they will just charge a bit more for scanning and may try to add on some more repairs hoping you don't see or don't understand,btohqsg
You're definitely not treated equal and why would you be? You're not paying them their agent mark up after all,btohqsg
no no. you are paying them service fees regardless whether you buy from them or not.  this is service department costs.  not from their sales department.,btohqsg
But many PIs nowadays will offer their own workshops and warranties  very common because of the c&c 10 year warranty. Cars and coffee  jack cars  etc. will offer a similar warranty as long as you service with them,btohqsg
Agreed  but it's a business as a whole mah  they won't treat you the same so that next time you think of buying from them for end to end solution. Save money must deal with stuff like this,btohqsg
what if you import your own?,btohqsg
Still similar  either go to the AD and do  they will treat you the same as any other dealer PI or you go outside,btohqsg
Most people buying PI cars or importing themselves will not want to go to the AD anyway as in majority of their cases the aim is to save money  the savings continue by going for repairs outside which are much cheaper,btohqsg
even if you go to PI workshops they wont too. as you dont buy from them. of course they will load up premiums when you want to do it.,btohqsg
when i said they wont means they will quote you in such a way that it is as good as not wanting you.,btohqsg
so no need to be technical here,btohqsg
Hmmm  maybe you should go try it out then. I know of people who have done this and they did not face any issues  just paid roughly the same as an AD car or PI from dealer car,btohqsg
there are situations where you want to go to dealers to do due to thier exerience and better equioment level  but they just wont entertain cars not sold by them.,btohqsg
definitely not roughly the same. i know this because my friend bought from PI.,btohqsg
Hmmmm  those I know have not faced this  different tiers and brands of cars as well,btohqsg
in malaysiam because of the size of maerkets  the less busy ones will entertain. the busiest ones with lots of customers like autobavaria (PML equivalent) will ask you for rm20K first to open account.,btohqsg
We in sgcarmart leh‚Ä¶ not mycarmart,btohqsg
Eh‚Ä¶ good ring though. MyCarMart.@SGCM_Admincan consider as MIA? Member Idea in Action,btohqsg
A few bonus chances for good suggestions?,btohqsg
Yeah  we're talking about Singapore here,btohqsg
Malaysia market dynamics are very different,btohqsg
haha in singapore i know PML wont make you fork out money to open account.,btohqsg
Service is where they make good margins on as we know‚Ä¶ a famous ws makes 100% on each part man,btohqsg
Yes Mr Xun  they will just charge you maybe a few hundred extra for the whole service (case dependent on the cost of whatever is being done) and offer you the warranty packs. For them it's easy business because they lose you on the sales side so can make up on the service side because no need to offer warranty if it's just service but still earn the same amount as the AD cars.,btohqsg
Delivery miles  so will consider new  just PI. Most PIs list their ready stock with delivery miles as used cars on sgcm but also have the same listing under new from what I've seen. Most of them you are the first owner on record too,btohqsg
correct Mr Arnav  great that i manage to understand you in a few sentences!,btohqsg
"This particular unit was used by them for demos so I guess you can say ""new"" but they bring in unregistered no owner stock too",btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt officially launch in SG leh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Im looking forward to see the GR86 officially launch in SG! What about you?,btohqsg
Thought the BRZ launch already? Was at the Subaru dealer last week,btohqsg
Nope  havent. Expected launch date is early 2023,btohqsg
for sure haha  new GR86  BRZ and Nissan Z. this generation of lightweight sports cars might unfortunately be the last generation that will be fully petrol powered.,btohqsg
Lets hope mazda will come out w a new MX5 too,btohqsg
Ah I see  guess the one at their leng kee dealer is just for demo and show then,btohqsg
Yup most likely to ‚Äúpoison‚Äù potential customersüòÜ,btohqsg
Which subbie you looking at anyways?,btohqsg
Just spotted it while going by,btohqsg
subies are not meant to be driven,btohqsg
they belong to the jackstands of workshops,btohqsg
technically is a toyota so got hope,btohqsg
Wah the way you say it thoüòÇ,btohqsg
you ever see anybody try to do the cannonball with a subie? no. all attempts fail within 15mins,btohqsg
Didn't news reported that Subbie relented and will be releasing WRX STI?,btohqsg
A very illegal run to set a record time from the red ball garage in new york to the portofino hotel in LA,btohqsg
OOOO but I don‚Äôt think BRZ is made to be fast tho,btohqsg
Thought its more of a handling car hahaha,btohqsg
the past records were held by cars like an S6  E63  etc.,btohqsg
calling all BRZ/86 owners  your admin call your car slowüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
this record has been beaten already if i'm not wrong. There's also a Diesel car and electric car record,btohqsg
no STI this year sadly ü•≤,btohqsg
ok u give me pls üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1X2fEjFQxQ&ab_channel=VINwikiThe tesla record  no other EV has attempted as the supercharger network in north america is unmatched,btohqsg
Still faster than the flat 4 of my beetle. ü§£,btohqsg
aiyo shane ah  i give you car that can drive want anot.. i scared i give u wrx sti u also cannot drive,btohqsg
Lets just say they don't get caught because of things they equip,btohqsg
HAHAHHAHA curious tho  which lane do you usually drive on the expressway?,btohqsg
"@arnavgulianianyway  just got news that although the BRZ is already in the showroom but there wont be any official launch for it.Motor Image willlikely""launch"" it at the Singapore Motorshow 2023.",btohqsg
Lane 1  2 and 3. Depending on mood. haha,btohqsg
Never behind tipper trucks for sure.,btohqsg
Hope you don't run into@bbfasingaporein lane 2! later get stuck,btohqsg
I also always siam tipper truck hahaha,btohqsg
based on current COE it will be 230k+,btohqsg
That is when I will switch to lane 1,btohqsg
so can expect GR86 to be around that price... the PI one is good deal now,btohqsg
But of course even if I am going 90km/h  there is still going to be a random car (usually continental) overtake and squeeze in front of me,btohqsg
i dont tihnk the brz at 230k ba haha,btohqsg
haha the gr86 so barebones.. need to zhng abit ba... cant go sepang w steelies sia,btohqsg
yes this don‚Äôt even know if have air con tbh hahaha,btohqsg
nobody cares about  stock sports rims anyway,btohqsg
the first gen RC in japan don't even have carpet those  things,btohqsg

Autobac has promotion for 4 pcs Dunlop tyre right now till 31 May.They quoted $276/4pcs 185/65r15Dunlop SP Touring R1,btohqsg
I wonder how many cars these days still uses 15‚Äù rims. Most are 16‚Äù and above.,btohqsg
Cars like the old Honda stream  Toyota kijang Innova  etc. are using 15 inch wheels,btohqsg
Looking through sgCaramart  wondering why some available pre-owned car already has STA grade (A  B)  isn't it required by buyer normally?,btohqsg
I see. Newer cars like honda jazz already 16‚Äù üòÇ,btohqsg
15inch + tyres give much better comfort and fuel economy. No need to go BIG Wheels and low profile tyres for econoboxes.,btohqsg
But it‚Äôll not pick up most faults. Better to send to mechanic still for a detailed inspection,btohqsg
Because nowadays the fuel economy differentials between the two sizes are very minimal so only cars that are meant to be very affordable have downsized wheels for cost cutting,btohqsg
Many uses 15inchPriusNoah/voxyHyundai ionicAlot of phv and taxi on the road,btohqsg
I see  so buyer don't have to pay the fee.,btohqsg
Its done as an indicator for car condition  kind of like a Mechanic's inspection or PPI but done through STA to show that they are independent and not influenced by the seller or buyer,btohqsg
"15"" steelies are still available. 16"" sports rims are usually dealer's upgrade",btohqsg
I guess depends on the profiles too. Suv uses more rubber even if 15‚Äù,btohqsg
If listed on sgcm with the grade already you don't but with most dealers  they are open to sta inspections at buyer's cost as long as they don't have anything to hide,btohqsg
True. What is it recommended to do after the transaction or before?,btohqsg
"SUV is minimum 17"". Unless you refer to the fake SUV ""Crossovers"" lol",btohqsg
Yuppp depends on profiles too  if you have 15 inchers with 30 profile (very hard to find  but let's say you do) your comfort will be pretty horrible,btohqsg
Usuallt before the deal is closed  some dealers will allow you to send to your own mechanic for a fee you pay. If they require a deposit from you before allowing  walk away.,btohqsg
Then if everything is good  proceed to pay for the car. If negotiable  ask them to replace any wear and tear identified out of goodwill or co-pay,btohqsg
Before  since after the transaction the car is yours already. Dealer only liable to 6 month engine and gearbox warranty but you don't know how they will react to issues and if they will solve them amicably or not,btohqsg
Omg. 30 is already very harsh on 19‚Äù üòÖ,btohqsg
Some dealers also offer a short term wear and tear warranty for a week or so  within this warranty you can do a more detailed inspection and look for any issues that can be rectified and discuss with them to do so,btohqsg
Just a matter of what one wants ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Jimmy's use 15/16! But I think he was referring to full size SUVs,btohqsg
I saw somewhere they require some deposit with black and white written (mainly for STA or AAS kind of inspection since there is a grade given). Not sure how private workshop do it.,btohqsg
Ya for one case recently a friend bought a used 2017 Lexus IS. The dealer only allowed him to send to his preferred workshop aft paying a deposit of 2k,btohqsg
For those who cares Low priced performance tyres..https://www.tyrereviews.com/Tyre/Habilead/SportMax-S2000.htm,btohqsg
But some like Eurokars allowed the buyer to send to own mechanic with no deposit,btohqsg
So to me it differs from person to person,btohqsg
It really depends on the dealer. Some require deposit  some don't and will handle the inspection for you as long as you pay for it. For a private workshop  the dealer must agree to send to your workshop  usually if they agree to this  it's a good sign already,btohqsg
I thought i saw a s2k car in a glance. üòÖ,btohqsg
Will they send someone their own together for the check?,btohqsg
Depends on the dealer confidence in the unit and also how big they are. A smaller dealer will always be more apprehensive as they usually have only a few units available and wouldn't want anything to go wrong,btohqsg
Yes  you cannot take the car yourself. They will bring it around usually since it is registered under their name and their company insurance,btohqsg
I never bought 2nd hand before but these are some of the tips that I‚Äôve gathered from experienced friends who did,btohqsg
So as long know what to expect and you can score yourself a good deal,btohqsg
some is for comfort reason. thick tyre wall always give smoother ride,btohqsg
Thick tyre wall very goodI kena pothole at SLE before yishun.Never burst.7 other cars burst. At roadshoulder.I report to LTA immediately.The next day contractor called me and thanks me.Said pothole very big.,btohqsg
High profile tyres adds comfort too!,btohqsg
Yup low profile is pain !!,btohqsg
and it may not necessary be less grip.,btohqsg
My tyre profile too low when I go at higher speed very bumpy,btohqsg

too many street circuit imo. Turning into FE. SPA is still my fav circuit.,btohqsg
I love driving at SPA in video games.,btohqsg
Very unique high speed circuit.Once tyre loose grid = gg liao HAHA,btohqsg
The moment your front tyre lost traction and understeer....,btohqsg
i agree that there are too many street circuit  but when you see circuits like circuit de barcelona-catalunya  circuit can also be boring haha,btohqsg
my all time fav F1 circuit will still be the nurburgring nordschleife,btohqsg
15 inch is great. Cheap tyres  good comfort  economical for low powered cars  and very common size.13 and 14 incher are rarer.,btohqsg
I saw 21‚Äù on my neighbour‚Äôs car before‚Ä¶ super big,btohqsg
Too bad FOM is demanding lots of money to host a gp and traditional circuit is being sideline of not able to cough out the money.,btohqsg

When the tyre is like 42 psi,btohqsg
Less rolling resistance like over inflated tires.,btohqsg
42 is the base recommended level I believe for the m3p,btohqsg
Agree though  sounds high for the car hahah,btohqsg
My beetle front only need 19 PSI lol,btohqsg
True. Depending on tire sizes. Smaller tires usually lower pressure.,btohqsg
But I'm guessing because of the instant pulls most Teslas are forced through  it's needed,btohqsg
Yuppp  also depends on weight of the car,btohqsg

my only conern is fire risk. i mentioned this in the very beginning in some other groups.,btohqsg
when not done right. battery can catch fire easily,btohqsg
Actually most report show that ev risk of catching fire is lesser then Ics,btohqsg
Yeah  because with EVs something really has to go wrong before it catches fire and it's generally slower. With ICE  a few wrong mods or some issue and your car can catch on fire super quick and it can be worse because of the tanks of petrol/diesel being carried,btohqsg
i heard ice combust petrol for the car to move...,btohqsg
ya ice easier catch fire bro,btohqsg

Many ADs throw in the cameras for free as well as part of the offer. Like PA and PML do with the Audi/BMW branded dashcams which are worth between 800 to 1000 according to them,btohqsg
Others will provide a list of approved workshops to get cameras installed and you can ask them to cook the price of it into the car price and do it for you before delivery,btohqsg
Ya but someWill still insist to go theirs,btohqsg
Yuppp  but usually can get for free if you nego a bit  to them the cost is minimal since they buy in bulk and send business to the workshops,btohqsg
