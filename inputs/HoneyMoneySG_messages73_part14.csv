Yes it does  do trigger manually for second and third payment,btohqsg
Any idea how is this even possible üßê This is even better than interbank rates‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Thank you  kinda like a hack cuz the store I'm purchasing from is not eligible for those bonus if direct paywabe. Quite lucky to have this pay later function  making it eligible,btohqsg
My bad for for the typo.Means to say combined spending on both cards hit $500? This minimum spending is for the UOB one account interest?,btohqsg
Yep just for uob one acc interest,btohqsg
hi all let‚Äôs say i have the instarem amaze + CRMC combo.i pay with amaze on a dining expenditure in Thailand.Do i earn miles??,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use my uob one card to buy Cold Storage voucher got additional 5% cashback?,btohqsg
Hi all. Is anyone aware if utilities is excluded for maybank platinum visa?,btohqsg
Thanks Queenie. In that case  it‚Äôs a good card to use for foreign transaction + earning miles yeah?,btohqsg
Save slightly on foreign fee plus get miles,btohqsg
Bosses can advise what's the best way to pay insurance currently? Understand there's some nerf etc.,btohqsg
Alright got it! Would you recommend the miles pairing to be UOB Lady‚Äôs card with HSBC Revolution or UOB PPV?The miles pooling for UOB is quite attractive but the $5 spend block quite annoying. And hsbc has no annual fees ever which is a plus but the white/blacklist is a minus.,btohqsg
uob ppv dun count to uob one account card spend bonus interest. uob lady is the only miles card that do. would u be able to meet min $500 spend monthly on uob lady card? btw 5.6mpd bonus points on uob lady has no $5 block.,btohqsg
Yeap understand that the UOB PPV doesn‚Äôt count for the bonus interest. For my miles and also UOB one account bonus interest strategy would be smth like this:1. UOB one debit card for utilities and bills around ($200 ish)2. UOB lady‚Äôs card for transportation usage (grab and simplygo) (around $300)3. HSBC Revolution or UOB PPVLeaning more towards the HSBC Revolution card for the $1 block spend. Any inputs on this?,btohqsg
Still trying to figure it out base on my expenses and spending habit  thanks for the patience üôèüèª,btohqsg
Yes this does work to earn you the bonus interest. HSBC Revo is a good card  but you can consider Amaze+CRMC too since you have taken care of utilities and simplygo on UOB which are 2 excluded categories on CRMC. Then HSBC Revo can be used for flight/hotel bookings to optimize all your spending into miles,btohqsg
This sounds good to go  thank you so much Wilson  Trazora and Zion!For CRMC and Amaze  must tap physical card correct? My research tells me that Apple Pay doesn‚Äôt grant us the full miles earned. But is tap using Amaze card correct? ü§î,btohqsg
Hello gurus! May i ask if there is such thing as no vacancy when requesting to change my billing cycle to calendar month format for CitiPM?This is because i called the CSO and she said there is no more vacancy to change my billing cycle to calendar month format üòÖ,btohqsg
As of now Apple Pay doesn't support amaze  so you'll have to tap the physical (and uglier) card to earn 4 mpd on CRMC linked to it. If you prefer using Apple Pay  Revo does most of the job well  check whitelisted mcc to be sure,btohqsg
Hahaha  right. I think I‚Äôll have both and use Revo as a main card and switch it around when I need to book air ticket and hotel for travels due to 1k cap per month. Either way both is a good to have cards in the wallet ü§ó,btohqsg
Just checked  they only support SGD to MYR  not the other way round,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/saveuplevelup/@ChrisHMSGNot sure if you will be interested to look at this?,btohqsg
for payment of income tax  is there any credit card to use that can earns points or miles or have any benefits?,btohqsg
Hello gurus  can check when will the 5% citibank smrt be reflected in Citibank app?,btohqsg
must be via payment services like ipaymy  CardUp  Citi PayAll  etc. Last time used to be able to do Grab hack but no more.,btohqsg

Hi guys  new here! Just wanted to be sure  if i set up recurring card payment on SP App for my utilities bill (paid using UOB One Debit card)  will that automatic charge to my debit card count towards the $500 min spend for the UOB One Account interest? Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi  does paying SingTel mobile monthly bill falls in the category of UOB evol CC?,btohqsg
Actually for sgd to myr  CIMB SG has one of the best rates. However  you need to open a CIMB MY account to deposit the myr after exchange. Do check it out,btohqsg
I think you asked this question twice. If nobody answer  means you can search the chat history to get the answer.,btohqsg
i see. thank you for the heads up,btohqsg
I have cimb account  but what I need now is to convert MYR to SGD  not the other way round,btohqsg
For those who opened the UOB Stash account which needs to maintain $100K or increase the Monthly Average Balance  may I know if you withdraw out the monthly interest as if it is over $100K  the interest is only 0.05%?  Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi morning to all experts here  may I check what will happen to the CPF allocation after reaching FRS on CPF SA account? Will 100% of new CPF contributions goes into OA account?,btohqsg
It remains unchanged. Your SA just continues to grow. The key difference is that you can no longer RSTU  and your MA contributions will overflow into your OA.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGthink I saw you on  the bus to camp haha,btohqsg
Yes  just doing my annual national duty,btohqsg

Was surprised to see Paris baguette offering 8mpd on Kris+ when I bought some bread this morning. Previously was 6mpd,btohqsg
Sorry for the confusion.  Remittance cannot.  Money exchange can.,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs a TT function from MYR to SGD in the CIMB MY internet banking platform. According to their ads  they guarantee best rates in town. But from experience  it‚Äôs easy and very good rates to change sgd to myr  but not the other way round. Just a demand and supply reality of the currencies. Hope that helps,btohqsg
Guys anyone know how to check the bonus OCBC$ credited to your rewards balance?,btohqsg
