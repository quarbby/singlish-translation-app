I'm urgent on selling cuz I can't pay the monthly loan alr,btohqsg
Try do grab and hitch (grab and ryde) to cover? And u can also rent out ur car via drivelah,btohqsg
If dun need sell for cash,btohqsg
I can't do grab cuz I don't have the private hire thing,btohqsg
I'm selling it at my full settlement amount only,btohqsg
I would assume the car is over 7 years old so cannot do,btohqsg
My pay got cut alr cuz my company change my position,btohqsg
Cause if like that  hard to sell cause your loan probably higher than market price,btohqsg
Means if u sell ur car can settle full settlement and no cash back?,btohqsg
Then rather u rent out ur car,btohqsg
$50 per day also can cover your cost while waiting for your car to sell,btohqsg
I'm ok with no money taking back alr cuz I really want get rid of the loan,btohqsg
Yea jus sign up all e hitch platform n jus whack all the limit everyday Do lalamove for short trips/deliveryDen also post ur car on drivelah and rent out,btohqsg
Until ur car get sold.. if not also jialat bro,btohqsg
LalamoveMilkrunGogovanPickupsFoodPandaYou put your car at Drive Lah to rent out. $50-70/day,btohqsg
Need factor in his petrol cost also,btohqsg
I got think of drivelah but they confirmed want apply for commercial insurance,btohqsg
Need meh. They pay e insurance for u i tot,btohqsg
Yea best is just do lalamove for 3 hours like that to get $50,btohqsg
They have their own insurance. You check it out first.,btohqsg
Then you do two weeks enough already to cover 1 month,btohqsg
How much you selling it for,btohqsg
58k the full settlement amount only,btohqsg
Anyone can buy my car pls pls,btohqsg
Eh yours is the black one in sgcm is it,btohqsg
Still have 6years and 6month COE,btohqsg
Say good bye to credit score and let it get repo,btohqsg
Have you tried selling back to the original plave you bought it from?,btohqsg
Yes but they taking it back low,btohqsg
From what I see you purchased very recently because their post of your car still up there,btohqsg
Hi there!! If it helps  its best for you to head down to our Sgcarmart Quotz inspection centre to have your car inspected and then get a proper quotationðŸ˜Š-R,btohqsg
Yes I brought it on July then after a month ltr my company change my position then my pay low alr so it's make me can't afford and continue paying,btohqsg
I had been stress for 3 weeks alr,btohqsg
Hope someone can help me out on this,btohqsg
U got ask ur dealer if u push back need pay how much,btohqsg
I got ask them to take back but they say they take back in at around 30k,btohqsg
In the very worst case u push back  refinance the 28k with the dealer if they allow and see whether they can work out a repayment plan for u,btohqsg
Cause I first time buying a car then when I go down to view the car the dealer keep intro the goods of this car and they say they will help me make the monthly affordable but then idk tht they taking the loan seem high,btohqsg
I think it's best you take the advice of others to gain a side income for the time being while you wait for the car to be sold as from the looks of it  your price is very inflated and will be a hard sell,btohqsg
Dk u have to speak to ur dealer and ask them to work out a repayment plan for u,btohqsg
Lower as the dealer say can don't need down so much,btohqsg
https://www.quotz.com.sg/cars-for-bidding?MOD=Chevrolet+&FR=Any@xhao_xzxYou can take a look at the prices of chevy Aveo5 that were transacted on Sgcarmart Quotz to get an approximate idea of how much you can sell your car for,btohqsg
If you are satisfied with it  you can get your car inspected by Sgcarmart Quotz and get them to help you sell your car as quickly as within a day.-R,btohqsg
But the link u send I see but the price all can't cover the full settlement amount,btohqsg
It definitely wotn cover full amount,btohqsg
The coe expiry diff from urs also bro,btohqsg
no matter what it will never cover cos u have to pay rule of 78 i assume + u bought it at a very inflated price,btohqsg
Bro serious best advice is to consign and post at sgcm. Just work lalamove part time while waiting for you car to be sold. No need special insurance or the phv sticker. Just do 5 orders to get $50. Work two weeks can get 700 liao. DO NOT BORROW MORE MONEY TO PAY YOUR MONTHLY EVEN FROM LICENSED MONEY LENDER. That will only dig your hole even deeper.,btohqsg
And u cant expect to cover. There def be losses but what u need now is to make it the minimal loss and find ways to get cash now,btohqsg
Last time the car was sold over at quotz,btohqsg
