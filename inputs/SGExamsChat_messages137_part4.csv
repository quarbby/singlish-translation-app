Umm unseen poetry (from the perspective of y1) remember lit devices  rhyme scheme  prepare some simple rhymes???,btohqsg

Wat do u think literature exams are about,btohqsg
Simple rhymes in case they ask you to make a poem based on the text,btohqsg
They will never ask you to do that,btohqsg
Oh welllll then my school sucks,btohqsg
In JC  I spammed and analysed unseen poems,btohqsg
Yeah i admit idk much cuz im y1 and cuz no lit,btohqsg
And then give to teacher to mark during consult,btohqsg
Just listen to ur teacherâ€™s advice,btohqsg
Cause lit is a teacher reliant subject where u need a lot of feedback on your thought process,btohqsg
yall know a place that can study outside,btohqsg
Not many places offer this service esp during covid,btohqsg
if you are in the East try Lifelong learning centre,btohqsg
huh covid they allow ah?? if can i wanna go leh. staying at home sucks,btohqsg
it is still open  I went there 2 weeks ago ish but I went there for 1h only. I am not sure if can stay longer,btohqsg
wth u can only stay for 1hr??,btohqsg
but should be can because the skills classes there are still going on,btohqsg
tbh that applies to all libraries,btohqsg
you can chill at the public spaces there  no need go the library,btohqsg

I used to camp there last year almost everyday 2-6pm,btohqsg
yea libraries especially the bugis and tampines hub were my go-to but now covid messing everyth up lmao,btohqsg
I never go tamp hub cause a lot of people. LLC public space not so crowded,btohqsg
is it possible to change your study environment to be more conducive? personally i just move my gaming pc away to another room  and it helps to concentrate,btohqsg
yea i like to move my distractions (e.g. phone  tv) out of my bedroom. smtms i also move my study table about lmao. just so i dont get bored with my place,btohqsg
u can also study in other places in yr house too! at least thats what i do,btohqsg
"yeah when i was overseas  i tried doing this strategy where i keep my room a ""happy"" place  so no studying there  I would go to a library or the common area to do work. that works too",btohqsg
"yea haha thats exactly what i do but covid now is not helping :""(",btohqsg
u could try making a study room or another study place if u have the space in yr home,btohqsg
