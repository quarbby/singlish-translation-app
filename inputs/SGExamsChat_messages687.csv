text,group
you cannot apply to any other context,btohqsg
take away the a level question style and you’re lost,btohqsg
U can mug to even get close to full marks tbh (like above 80%),btohqsg
I think my batch the highest in h1 math was 100?,btohqsg
anyways am i genuinely passionate about bio ? idk lmaooooo,btohqsg
mugging is just a means to the end,btohqsg
And h2 chem there are consistently > 10 ppl w above 80 overall,btohqsg
ccp wansui pls don't arrest me,btohqsg
Am i genuinely passionate about chem n phy👀👀,btohqsg
too early to think you’re imposter bc real talk,btohqsg
i not gud enuff for imposter even💀  for amc(australian math competition) got me spot on on the average % for the cohort,btohqsg
no cause i think i like bio,btohqsg
i visit u when i go cgina,btohqsg
Tbh A level 4 subjects i can easily force myself to like a subject and start mugging,btohqsg
do well for j1  take H3 then see,btohqsg
Oh my friend got H3 bio merit,btohqsg
tbh i liked my subjects i just don't like the exams,btohqsg
our school hasnt gotten high distinction in over a decade lol,btohqsg
shld only take if ur alr scoring crazy in ur existing combi,btohqsg
U took moe or smu game theory,btohqsg
not for those who are alr struggling,btohqsg
also like learning it at a uni level is very diff thing from jc so that’s smth you can look into,btohqsg
I took h3 math for fun omo,btohqsg
i had to slave my time lol,btohqsg
my best friend studied bio for undergrad then is now in vet sch,btohqsg
2-3 weeks to reply my text,btohqsg
HAHHA honestly uni not as stressful as jc lol,btohqsg
cb my a level content taught in one mod in 6 weeks,btohqsg
ya cause u don't have people breathing down your next,btohqsg
It is btr than i hving to study y1-3 knowledge for my 2 core mods,btohqsg
i wldnt be 7 weeks behind in uni if i had someone breathing down my next,btohqsg
NO wait till u come pharmacy,btohqsg
LOL WHO ASK U GO PHRAM,btohqsg
act law also not that easy,btohqsg
for me im used to it and im the only one who shes ok with leaving on read lol,btohqsg
bc she knows i won’t scold,btohqsg
And u know she will eventually reply,btohqsg
Tbh if i not planning to reply atm i will not open it,btohqsg
then ppl get pissed at me,btohqsg
tts y i rarelt text in thisbgrp,btohqsg
uni things - u can't do things even tho you're supposed to be allowed to because fuck you,btohqsg
at least yall can SU compulsory mods..,btohqsg
meh idt that's much of a factor la ngl,btohqsg
if u apply NUS because of the SU system,btohqsg
then u need to reconsider your entire decision process,btohqsg
mine depends. if someone catches me at a bad time i’ll end up putting it off forever,btohqsg
i don’t think it’s smth they gotta fix lol,btohqsg
like its smth nus has but its not an issue with ntu per se,btohqsg
Tbvh you can only use your SU on your BDEs  and in my experience most BDEs they kinda give you a hint on what your final grade will be after your final test so its your discretion to use your SU,btohqsg
is the limited about of SU u have rly that much of a factor in a course of more than 100+ AUs,btohqsg
i mean i get whr ntu is coming from ig,btohqsg
i only taking 1 bde in sch lol,btohqsg
ok i think maybe letting ntu students su compulsory mods that aren’t like your major stuff might be good,btohqsg
ya that one i can agree with,btohqsg
I basically used 2 / 4 SUs because i cant do korean and geog lmao,btohqsg
but wah people who expect to be able to SU physics mods as a physics major,btohqsg
im gna SU my BDE which is an accounting mod,btohqsg
but fuck that shit it's my last sem i lazy study,btohqsg
ok but smth i like about US (idk how it works for non ntu local ones) is being able to drop the course within 2 weeks before the final exam,btohqsg
not like 2 weeks in and you’re locked in,btohqsg
actually my postgrad mods also can HAHAH,btohqsg
idt ntu/nus will ever do that,btohqsg
but ya my friends there dropped a math course 8 weeks in,btohqsg
it’s basically dabao without having to get MC,btohqsg
drop like it's not even on their transcript ah,btohqsg
uhh afaik depends on sch. some dont show and some will show as dropped,btohqsg
also if you fail and retake a mod the old grade is nullified,btohqsg
or you can retake a mod you didn’t do well on to push gpa up,btohqsg
u pay to stay in school longer,btohqsg
but overall i’m ok with how ntu does it tbh,btohqsg
wah but NBS 3 years then still need fit all the CC mods 💀,btohqsg
i actually spoke to some of the spms faculty about how the physics curriculum is alr so packed,btohqsg
then bc of ICC they had to shift mods back that are tbh quite fundamental,btohqsg
for acc 4 au core mods + icc is,btohqsg
yk we have cores all the way till y3s1,btohqsg
hooray to ntu foregoing major courses for some dumb interdisciplinary bs,btohqsg
like by y3 it’s maybe 1-2 cores and the rest you take wtv but still lol,btohqsg
idh the concepts of cores and PEs,btohqsg
the common curriculum everyone takes in the first sems,btohqsg
either core or ICC or BDE,btohqsg
Cc5 do be the easiest icc tho,btohqsg
Its the mod i did the most nothing in,btohqsg
is chill but still a waste of time,btohqsg
Its a waste of time if you let it be,btohqsg
Not my groupmates doing their cores in cc5,btohqsg
a lot of courses by y3 you’re picking your mods from a list within your major to clear AUs,btohqsg
not like the must take ones,btohqsg
And not us doing the presentation preparation 1 day before its due lmao,btohqsg
i milked the hell out of covid sem where we got free SUs tho,btohqsg
biz students are mostly PEs by the time they're Y2,btohqsg
i think only like 2 cores,btohqsg
like i feel by the end of y2 all the foundation stuff should be done,btohqsg
but physics in y3s1 then you touch on one of the main branches of uni physics,btohqsg
I dont recall which one was delayed,btohqsg
and i mean electromagnetism also delayed,btohqsg
Ya last time my brother did it in y2s1,btohqsg
if your prof is still tim liew next sem then good,btohqsg
I just cant wait for y3s1 to be done,btohqsg
Itll be the last of my cores,btohqsg
tim liew is so nice tho,btohqsg
also every thing you’ll need for the finals will be in your notes,btohqsg
Who do i need to beg to make him the course coordinator for anal mech,btohqsg
he’s been the coordinator forever so just pray?,btohqsg
he’s the one that woke me up bc i was snoring in lecture,btohqsg
then end up i got A+ and did fyp with him,btohqsg
Cant snore in lecture if im never there,btohqsg
i went bc my friends went,btohqsg
You has motivated me dear senior,btohqsg
alr sorted out lah but im still gg out with my og,btohqsg
by contrast my fam friends in china alw say it'll be fairly easy for me to get in LOL,btohqsg
but do you only want academic rigour for your uni life,btohqsg
new segment: H1 skibidi toiletyou must write an essay about the skibidi toilet lore  A = extra 10 rp,btohqsg
academic rigour is more important if you actually stay in academia,btohqsg
aka further studies or go into research stuff,btohqsg
i feel bad for those ppl with younger siblings,btohqsg
gotta endure the skibidi toilet song 100000 times,btohqsg
sorry this is what you talk to a person after 3 b2b lectures,btohqsg
my sister don't even know wth is skibidi toilet,btohqsg
i have no clue what that is,btohqsg
It’s a YT series featuring toilet bowls with human heads sticking out,btohqsg
Am not. At least that’s what I saw my friend’s children watching on the phones 😵,btohqsg
Think you can try find on YouTube,btohqsg
Hahaha some children are rather addicted to it though,btohqsg
Idk man. I don’t get the vids. I tried watching with the kids but all I see are shootings and explosions. I don’t get the plot,btohqsg
I reckon it’s just wide generational gap in my case when I don’t get the joy since it’s gen alpha vs prehistoric,btohqsg
The cartoons I watched have characters that yelled yabba dabba doooooo and not bang bang bang jibaboommmmm,btohqsg
Hee hee. Damn random but something just came to mind: do watch The Perks of Being a Wallflower (movie),btohqsg
just use a mirror can alr what,btohqsg
I feel better after reading this statement,btohqsg
there's probably gna be a dune pt 3,btohqsg
my friends sisters cannot stop yapping about skibidi toilet,btohqsg
A series on battles between humans and toilet bowls with heads sticking out that is found on YouTube,btohqsg
lmao it sounds so stupid when it’s described like that until you realise it’s true,btohqsg
Likely to be mistaken for trolling 🥲,btohqsg
i thought it wld be done,btohqsg
time to wait years for the next one,btohqsg
Some people really hv no awareness in this aspect  they only care about themselves,btohqsg
I hv a friend who always tell me all sorts of rants and blah blah  then ignore my messages sometimes,btohqsg
Even when he knows I’m in some problem,btohqsg
venting to friend is ok but is two way street,btohqsg
My dad ask me be careful of him  he is of defective character,btohqsg
doesn’t have to be two way street if there’s mutual understanding,btohqsg
Yea bruh I feel he is making it 1 way and it is so stupid of me to still try to reply him,btohqsg
this sort of ranting leads to unhealthy fs usually bc one or both sides dk boundaries,btohqsg
or dk how to set them,btohqsg
oh i meant two way street as in like,btohqsg
Cheap bro 1kg roast mutton meat only 24 sgd,btohqsg
for me it’s ok for my friends to rant to me if it’s just telling me stuff,btohqsg
they don’t expect me to give them solutions or counsel them,btohqsg
for me i generally ask if they want solutions or comfort,btohqsg
Some things that he tell me  i legit dun even know how to respond and it is making me feel worst,btohqsg
i have very limited emotional capacity so i’d rather save it for people that are more important or i’m closer to,btohqsg
which sounds blunt but i mean,btohqsg
some people are more worth my energy,btohqsg
I barely hv emotional capacity for myself,btohqsg
I dunno why i want to go help others when im still helping myself halfway,btohqsg
then don’t let people drain it from you if they aren’t worth it,btohqsg
But it is just i dun feel good ignoring him,btohqsg
i mean i also wanna help and for a long time i’ve put myself in a position to always be there for others,btohqsg
Yea very right  i need to settle my own first,btohqsg
but it has detrimental effects on myself,btohqsg
Actually what u said is very right,btohqsg
I need to settle myself first,btohqsg
end result is your own self is messed up or you can’t cope and have to disappoint others,btohqsg
your people pleasing tendencies is probs a big part of why you feel so overwhelmed a lot,btohqsg
Speaking of my parents  so my dad had a talk to me and what he can say is ‘with ur shitty results  u care about portfolio??’,btohqsg
It became im unappreciative of their care,btohqsg
eh for me i feel like,btohqsg
alot of times i cant do it anymore but js do it anyway,btohqsg
Yea i need to fix it else idk how im gonna survive,btohqsg
saying you know you gotta fix it is really not the same as doing smth about it,btohqsg
it starts by being more aware of yourself,btohqsg
My dad was like ‘see he is trying to psycho u into not doing pre-reg and u still dun see something wrong with him’,btohqsg
It is a bit bad to say this but i think i gotta shut people off if it is taking too much emotional burden on myself and i hv not settled myself,btohqsg
It depends on whether the other party understands my position but i guess there is a reason to everything a human do,btohqsg
tbh i get scolded / flamed many times for shutting people off,btohqsg
I think he said that partly coz he was desperate to get me n my mum back tgt,btohqsg
They can say things like ‘stop pretending u hvnt read my text’ or ‘is it so difficult to give a reply’,btohqsg
But sometimes there are various reasons why i dun reply,btohqsg
Yea i need to work something out (sunny side up actually teaches life stories lmao),btohqsg
It looks nice but the price isnt,btohqsg
bruh half of my class ck tdy,btohqsg
I only know ck is Creatine kinase,btohqsg
i think our CT also knows they not actl sick,btohqsg
Tbh i hv never attended any college events except those im involved in,btohqsg
but then got 2 ppl actl sick,btohqsg
i'm in MRC so i think i will be involved in alot of events one way or another lol,btohqsg
As long as u dun hv too many pl,btohqsg
Those that are near exam days like national day / teacher day,btohqsg
We didnt hv such a thing,btohqsg
do a bunch of random shit not related to our cg at all,btohqsg
Actually i guess it can help w bonding,btohqsg
except for the dinner at the ebd,btohqsg
6pm if ur parents not coming for the session,btohqsg
Wah i feel i missed out a lot then,btohqsg
And actually my parents will stir some shit if they come to the sch meet the teachers,btohqsg
ik ur parents slapped ur pw tutor,btohqsg
Some random china person just called me wth,btohqsg
And told me off in front of my ct and gp tutor (aka same as pw tutor) that i dun care abt gp and can they do sth about it,btohqsg
oh yeah some alumni come to our sch to give talk,btohqsg
wait i cant rmb if he class of 2021 or class of 202w,btohqsg
Ok but they prolly will only call sc people,btohqsg
but they are in Nus Law now,btohqsg
I think choon yong also went,btohqsg
I think my batch sc pres didnt do well,btohqsg
He is not in sc but in a lot of shit,btohqsg
He said my o lvl score is shitty,btohqsg
When they are worried i will fail A levels,btohqsg
They will prioritise people in their class over anything,btohqsg
But ofc ur grades must be ok,btohqsg
other than the guy in my class running for sc,btohqsg
How do i  cca selection is right at the beginning,btohqsg
There were many sc in calisto (my house ala cygnus now) fr 18s201,btohqsg
no i'm just there to feel important,btohqsg
even if i'm not ogl i'll probably get involved one way or another,btohqsg
U see the tm couples ah,btohqsg
Tbh their grades threshold for ogl is pretty low,btohqsg
Uk what i was known for in tm,btohqsg
She went up on stage I think,btohqsg
I think tm gives away A LOT of cca awards but ofc not me la,btohqsg
Yea i actually had 4 awards in tm (not bragging but supposed to be 5),btohqsg
i have received no awards from primary to secondary school,btohqsg
Iz ok  u will get sth in tm,btohqsg
I only know 2 couple omo,btohqsg
i only have like 1 friend from ori,btohqsg
Maybe i should change subj combi,btohqsg
I'm tempted to do it for shits and giggles,btohqsg
Help it is 5.30 and they say they will let me know outcome by today,btohqsg
Actl i got a way leh,btohqsg
I think they knocking off at 6,btohqsg
It would be so 🤡 if i did,btohqsg
i have the craziest story rn,btohqsg
sum dude from another class piss at the back of the class cus the cher dont let him go toilet,btohqsg
with other students in the classroom,btohqsg
man is marking his territory in the classroom,btohqsg
he walk to the back n piss,btohqsg
how do you even train a cher for that,btohqsg
in the first case a trained cher wld let him go,btohqsg
"imagine ""oi oi OIIII what you doing"" "" *trickling piss sound* """,btohqsg
Why not he urinate in the class and see if cher changes his mind,btohqsg
go to the back of the class n piss,btohqsg
meanwhile i think y'all were right  i should not bother with this friend  like he is just not showing the same level of understanding as i did to him when he complains to me about sutff,btohqsg
like instead of idk being empathetic or whatever  he tells me facts like 'round 2'  'please chill'  like what even that just makes me feel worst bruh,btohqsg
ok but high iq does not mean high eq does not mean good character,btohqsg
wah the hot singapore weather is giving me a freaking headache,btohqsg
or is it coz i stand and look at my phone for too long hoping for a call or sth,btohqsg
today's humidity level has gone insane,btohqsg
sitting inside a class with aircon switched on made me feel like i wanna collapse any time soon,btohqsg
fml ok i got the rejection email and i cant get to work now,btohqsg
I be using any kind of excuse to not do work but ya today's weather is no go,btohqsg
life is full of failures but also full of overcoming,btohqsg
if ur friend is not showing understanding to u to the same level as u try to understand whatever he is saying to u  what would u do,btohqsg
And if I'm done with their shit,btohqsg
If possible I outright cut them off,btohqsg
and also i have ran out of excuses not doing work else i will fail my exam,btohqsg
i am still not done w my pharm revisions and hv not touched econs,btohqsg
so like if they just ditch my feelings  i will ditch theirs too and reply in anyway i wish,btohqsg
look at what he is saying,btohqsg
no point me trying to empathize with him right,btohqsg
why am i being too nice,btohqsg
he can complain to me about something even knowing that im down,btohqsg
like he has no self awareness,btohqsg
He is probably just a very factual and straight to the point person?,btohqsg
i wanted to go for a jog,btohqsg
yes but it is not about celebrating at this moment,btohqsg
Run in the rain train for ns,btohqsg
it is like he can vent to me and i try to understand him,btohqsg
isnt ns indoors most of the time,btohqsg
but the other way  he dun give a shit burh,btohqsg
he is making his problem become mine,btohqsg
but then he is not showing mutual uk what i mean,btohqsg
so i the more i should not bother with what he is telling me right,btohqsg
it is just wasting my time actually,btohqsg
sometimes he make me regret replying to him,btohqsg
"I think imo you need to be more firm and steady bom pi pi   sometimes it is what it is and since you know how hes talking to you like it's obv psychological tactics or wtv ig? Idk enlighten me if I'm wrong. Pt is dont or rather try not to be easily so called "" affected"" by it yea it's easier said than done but it's just the real world man LOL",btohqsg
Smth to adapt and get used to,btohqsg
yea i know im being too idk how to put it  too nice maybe??? until i feel he is making use of me,btohqsg
i feel like im not the only one running into this problem  but i need to be more firm,btohqsg
it is worst when entering the workforce,btohqsg
ur next advice will be referring him to imh,btohqsg
my dad said i need to see a psychologist,btohqsg
who is this someone else that he listens more to,btohqsg
her colleagues give her the wrong directions she ended up in TEMASEK junior college,btohqsg
I didn't go btw that time,btohqsg
The a in ang stands for yApping,btohqsg
I think ms pang for Ur batch,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
i think ms lim and ms pang both speaking,btohqsg
lucky my friend lend me power bank otherwise my phone wld be dead by now,btohqsg
I just genuinely think you needa personal voice ( as in voice out more dgaf) and personal identity,btohqsg
i thought the pte was compulsory at first lmao,btohqsg
Ya cuz I help the makers booth urr,btohqsg
There'll be ptm at like may(?),btohqsg
o yeah my friend got into makers xlub,btohqsg
Except I prolly dun rmb name,btohqsg
do yall think i should start my own fried chicken chain in the future,btohqsg
im thinking of applying entrepreneurship skills,btohqsg
um if you really want  sure,btohqsg
im thinking of my receipts already,btohqsg
Aye kuro! I thought you veggie person!,btohqsg
r u gonna set up a stall in the koufu,btohqsg
if u make it better than steroids chicken,btohqsg
Damn kuro you must be malnourished,btohqsg
tbh i may have done this in sec1 but then again we were all immature as hell then,btohqsg
It's one thing to do in sec sch,btohqsg
sec1 sec2 do cringey shit can kinda forgive la,btohqsg
I mean idk how that pissed them off,btohqsg
And the person always liked to self-depreciate themselves through insults,btohqsg
It's okie the fact they blocked u means it affected them and it'll deffo linger ard their mind from time to time,btohqsg
You've done the best to your extent,btohqsg
Man I should become sgexams counsellor sia,btohqsg
Bro bluetick for like 3 messages is fine  but I’m talking entire paragraphs of rants,btohqsg
bro what is the cat violating the shark,btohqsg
Wah bro you're rlly risking it in a public chat ah,btohqsg
Yeah I mean it will be very wasted if not given away,btohqsg
Ah nvm forget about it probably not a good idea,btohqsg
But aren't the rides close or smth,btohqsg
No they still open some for the event,btohqsg
They like booked the entire park after it closes to the public,btohqsg
so basically im becoming a target of bullying in school,btohqsg
they are calling me names and racial slurs in my pms,btohqsg
im scared to go to school now,btohqsg
but im scared they will take revenge,btohqsg
Ok then what did she say,btohqsg
Just try to explain Ur side when U can,btohqsg
because the teacher said she will talk to them about it,btohqsg
Dw lol they won’t if the discipline master finds out,btohqsg
its bothering me because they are straight up laughing at me in class  mocking me for every little action i make,btohqsg
Make sure U got someone to support u,btohqsg
Cuz it's defo damn emotionally taxing also,btohqsg
and i even heard them say “why are the 3 of them (referring to my school friends) even friends with her”,btohqsg
Lol yeah this is SG  if the cher does nothing then get your parents to call sch and talk to principal,btohqsg
if i get grouped with them for pw iʼm going to stab myself,btohqsg
I mean if it's not that hard....maybe maybe..... you can just confront them politely ? 🤡 Like engage in small talk,btohqsg
those 3 girls who bullied me are on telegram,btohqsg
i dont want them to find out its me,btohqsg
later they will bully me more,btohqsg
in case they know this chat ezisys,btohqsg
I mean as long as you’ve told adults / your teacher you’re good,btohqsg
Just keep records of everything too,btohqsg
i want to kill myself man,btohqsg
But if it's really causing you that much distress,btohqsg
Idk if it helps U but,btohqsg
i have a lot of friends so its fine   i told them about it,btohqsg
get them Cher and you to mediate things out,btohqsg
because we had a longgggggg break in the afternoon,btohqsg
Idw my friends to be sad when they come my funeralThen also try to slowly find reasons to live for myself,btohqsg
i have been a target of bullying since primary school,btohqsg
and i do not like that,btohqsg
im still being bullied to this day,btohqsg
the students are already so old  why are they still so immature,btohqsg
Did you provoke them or smth?,btohqsg
and in class they like to roll their eyes at me and laugh at me,btohqsg
I mean have you figured out the words you'd phrase might potentially lead u to idk raising uproar,btohqsg
albeit me not even knowing them,btohqsg
i dont even know their names bro.. m,btohqsg
i dont even talk to people in school,btohqsg
Ah are you another fellow reclusive like me,btohqsg
ive always been reserved and antisocial from the beginning,btohqsg
LFG we are the same somewhat,btohqsg
my friends tell me that im easy to bully  thats why,btohqsg
I doubt your teacher can do anything about this part tho  best to ignore and walk away,btohqsg
i read through the msgstell ur cher. send all evidence to them via email or whatsapp. LEAVE A RECORD.if cher never take action  escalate to hod/discipline master. You must also say that its affecting your mental health severely and you have suicidal thoughts/no hope in living anymore. this is very important as MOE now takes mental health very seriously after some incidents so if you tell them you wanna off yourself  they will definitely have to take it seriously. also you arent lying cause from ur msgs its evident this is affecting you alotComing from someone with firsthand experience,btohqsg
Have you considered blocking them at all?,btohqsg
"At times liddat you gotta put up a front...don't/try not to make yourself seem vulnerable uh like gotta give off those"" fk w me and find out """,btohqsg
No one bullies me cause of that,btohqsg
I'll payback twice the times they did on me,btohqsg
oh no... im sorry this happened to you,btohqsg
since you have experience as well...,btohqsg
I’m also pretty introverted but I’ve never experienced this before lol,btohqsg
i did. they said i was scared,btohqsg
i just hope they dont find out that this chat exists,btohqsg
ya like anything if the shit they do escalate MUST take note,btohqsg
don't just live in anxiety and drown in worry,btohqsg
You should emphasise that your mental health is BADLY AFFECTED,btohqsg
im just worried in the future they may physically beat me up or something,btohqsg
Because MOE really put a lot of importance on this,btohqsg
"Dont care about ""what if their future ruined""",btohqsg
why would i care about this,btohqsg
i want karma to hit them,btohqsg
Anything don't keep it to yourself,btohqsg
If you get physically assaulted => go hospital  get injury report and MAKE A POLICE REPORT,btohqsg
spoiler alert: i used to be like that,btohqsg
If they tell or approach u   just respond cautiously and stay calm and listen what they have to say,btohqsg
ppl investigating (polis  teachers) love paper trails,btohqsg
Gives them evidence to work with,btohqsg
i can just use my phone,btohqsg
theres a voice recording app on there,btohqsg
Say beforehand like oh okie so imma approach/walk past them now then u walk while the recording is still on,btohqsg
if you want i can show you the dms they sent me,btohqsg
If anyth  live for yourself U can't please everyone 🔥,btohqsg
i was expecting a much better life  not this,btohqsg
why does it seem that the whole world is against me,btohqsg
everywhere i go im a target of tormentation,btohqsg
i told the teacher about it,btohqsg
i hope they dont try to beat me up next monday,btohqsg
oh man i just wish my bullies were dead,btohqsg
"Also I wouldn't ask u to ask your ""friends"" to record... Its just me lah btr be safe than sorry cause uk ppl aldr have beef w u and idk who knows sekali got double spy/betray/backstab... It's just as little ppl know is btr unless it's trusted ones uk then maybe u can ask THOSE ones to secretly record u encountering them",btohqsg
so that i can live my life worry-free,btohqsg
i only told my 3 friends in school about this beef,btohqsg
because its none of their business anyway,btohqsg
she's our YH for the J1 batch,btohqsg

I think he was yh + timetable com,btohqsg
in sec 1 i posted on ig a post fatshaming my friend then my teacher pulled me out on the first day of term 2,btohqsg
If they push your phone then it’s alr considered physical assault,btohqsg
That was exactly what i ‘lent’ my ig acct for my friend to do,btohqsg
Then afterwards end up the victim mum told my other friend to cut ties w me,btohqsg
W/o knowing that she was the one who was using my ig acct,btohqsg
No it's just shit will escalate if they know,btohqsg
my teacher just made me say sorry,btohqsg
My dad has to meet the principal,btohqsg
in sec 1 i was actually happy,btohqsg
Then there was once i got lost,btohqsg
Like i could not find the comp lab,btohqsg
No la let's be civilised ppl and do mission impossible way,btohqsg
Then i decided to just hide in the toilet,btohqsg
Not like those stomp or Karens style,btohqsg
And ofc i got into trouble,btohqsg
I think lim yew wei became physics hod,btohqsg
Created a mf quiz website on his own,btohqsg
I did not hear about that but he is the bald bespectacled guy,btohqsg
MY FRIENDS ALL CALL HIM BALDIE LA,btohqsg
Wah i realise he got pmo award,btohqsg
Apparently tm’s website said he is hod of science,btohqsg
He was one of my cca chers,btohqsg
Ok i found it  i dementia alr he is not bald,btohqsg
Last time they announce teacher com awards to students during college day,btohqsg
But now i dun even know if such exist,btohqsg
And i remembered i attended college day 2019  when i saw my pw cher going up as pw committee  i body fire,btohqsg
That kinda sucks  i had a mini version of this in jc where there is this clique in my class who hates me then when they walked past my friend group  they be like ‘hi 5 + 1’ like referring to me as an outsider / imposter,btohqsg
Just remember u hv people behind u  and it is not worth it being bothered by some others  hopefully ur teachers can talk some sense into them and they get the punishment they deserve🙏🙏,btohqsg
I had one free tix I wanted to give away here,btohqsg
i will end my life if they are in my pw group,btohqsg
im sorry that happened to you,btohqsg
humans are a horrible living species,btohqsg
you dont even need to do anything to them and they can be all up against you,btohqsg
Please dun say this and if it happens  u can highlight to ur tutor (at least that was what someone did in my class coz we has sth against me n the other way too),btohqsg
And i think it is a valid reason esp w ur proof and screenshots,btohqsg
My friend told me about it coz i was absent in sch on pw grp release and yea the cher swap groups but idk the full process coz i was not in class,btohqsg
oh you guys actually get a change in group mates?,btohqsg
why they hate you out of nowhere,btohqsg
Yea for no reason at all,btohqsg
I just do not want those 3 girls who bullied me in my group. none of them. theres 21? students in my class. shouldnt be so difficult,btohqsg
Idk there is a clique in my class that has all things against me for idk what reason,btohqsg
I didnt really talk to all 3 of them throughout the 2y,btohqsg
But i suspect is results reason which is such a stupid reason,btohqsg
im in a clique wirh 3 girls too. 4 of us... but we are all nice to others,btohqsg
and we make sure to be respectful and optimistic,btohqsg
Pw groups are internally decided i think so the cher should be able to do sth to prevent it,btohqsg
iʼll highlight this to my ct,btohqsg
Coz that grp changed in a split sec lmao,btohqsg
i heard shes a pw teacher  but not sure if shes our pw teacher,btohqsg
Yea girl clique more toxic than guys,btohqsg
Like my thinking is if just those few that hates u  it is not a u problem  it is a them problem,btohqsg
If it is a u problem  then u wun hv friends at all,btohqsg
Im a girl saying this but ya,btohqsg
i told my school friends about this,btohqsg
they were very understanding and gave me a listening ear,btohqsg
sometimes  my guys clique dont understand why the girls cliques suddenly got beef also,btohqsg
i also told them not to tell anyone and to pretend like they have not heard anything,btohqsg
i have just texted my ct to let her know that i wish to be grouped with anyonebutthem!,btohqsg
hope it all works out smoothly,btohqsg
and i will just ignore  if they want to take revenge iʼll tell the discipline master to give them detention or a bad conduct grade.,btohqsg
this will deprive them from uni scholarships and opportunities,btohqsg
Lol but in reality that’s a very tiny population to begin with,btohqsg
that will mean that they have 0% chance of getting those opportunities.,btohqsg
but since they are girls... well too bad they cant get any form of corporal punishment. they can just be put under in house suspension,btohqsg
how comfortable are you in letting your parents get involved?,btohqsg
