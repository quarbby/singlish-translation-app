i think u can consider if you can ‚Äòtolerate‚Äô the travelling time for the 2 years you‚Äôre gonna study there,btohqsg
I have alr been travelling long dist for sec sch and its been tiring. So i guess i would prefer to cut down travelling time.,btohqsg
Is like the quality between njc and nyjc around the same?,btohqsg
Both are nerdy schsNyjc is a v hardworking. Is that the culture that u would like,btohqsg
Hmm i would like to slack sometimes as well,btohqsg
Nyjc is rather stressfulPushes the students hard,btohqsg
But if studies is ur priority would be good,btohqsg
Thanks for the input i think i'll put njc as my first choice,btohqsg
No. Njc is 3rd. Nyjc is far behind,btohqsg
Yes njc is the 3rd best jc in sg after rjc n hci,btohqsg
No eh nyjc is 6 pts njc is 7 pts,btohqsg
P sure its the other way around,btohqsg
Once upon a time  a few centuries ago  maybe,btohqsg
Kumar feels happy for a sec,btohqsg
Anyway erhm! Think of the reduced travel time as adding an extra hour-1.5 to your day and then seeing whether its worth it to you,btohqsg
I thought about it  but I heard the facilities very old,btohqsg
Im ranking in terms of a lvl results  not cop,btohqsg
Omg why have evthg changed so much,btohqsg
Like stock market like that not stable,btohqsg
Then go nyjc since nyjc is above njc now n nyjc is very new,btohqsg
if distance then njc better tbh,btohqsg
"the difference in quality not big enough that u can just look at it in terms of ""who get higher a level avg"" imo",btohqsg
Try to see the programmes each sch offers and which sch more inline w ur interests?,btohqsg
actually is more or less similar across all JCs,btohqsg
NJC has a niche in research,btohqsg
then think abt how much u value the extra 1.5h bah,btohqsg
I abit out of the loop alr,btohqsg
NYJC has a niche in flexible combinations,btohqsg
depends on what you why you want to learn sports sci,btohqsg
Each JC has niches  which can tilt your decision one way or another,btohqsg
if u want enter sports industry,btohqsg
Oh my u need to get updated,btohqsg
in terms of heritage and culture I'd say yes,btohqsg
How does one even rank that...,btohqsg
Hii everyone   unfortunately I know some people didn‚Äôt do ‚Äúwell‚Äù should u did badly and require advice on DAE do message me. üôÇ,btohqsg
if you could go back to when you were sec 4  what would you have chosen,btohqsg
Definitely study harder n go to a top jc lah,btohqsg
Ya that's what most would think of,btohqsg
only can choose to go different place with the score u had,btohqsg
ya so what would u have chosen,btohqsg
I would have applied for acjc instead,btohqsg
Sorry i am out of touch,btohqsg
does sch ranking matter that much,btohqsg
I give u top notch sch,btohqsg
Feel free to disagree but i think most impt is ur own attitude,btohqsg
Results-wise  ranking is the least important thing,btohqsg
tbh i think attitude most impt,btohqsg
have anyone managed to revoke their eae after deadlines before?,btohqsg
but ofc school ranking matters also to some extent,btohqsg
Put a future 90 pointer in any JC and they will still get 90,btohqsg
