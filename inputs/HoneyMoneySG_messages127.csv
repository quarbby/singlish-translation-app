basically like a citi rewards earning 4mpd on first 1k  then past 1k its not 4mpd anymore,btohqsg
Amounts past 150k is 0.05%. SoEFFECTIVELY  it will reduce the effective interest rate.,btohqsg
IC. so ideally you stop at 150k then the remainder put in OCBC,btohqsg
Don't forget ocbc real salary requirement. Gotta juggle ocbc 360 and UOB one accordingly.,btohqsg
Confirm cheaper on shopee if you wait for deal or discount coupons. Coupled with uob one additional case rebate  I think brick and mortar store really hard to win even with sales...,btohqsg
Unless you are taking part in the quarterly promo then it is hard to be so accurate.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if pair with amaze + crcm buy ntuc voucher count 4mpd?,btohqsg
Any idea how long it takes for the payment of income tax via AXS to be reflected in iras site ?,btohqsg
Has anybody tried Trust Savings salary credit using DBS account crediting yet? Does it work?,btohqsg
I do not know understand what is DBS account crediting. It is mentioned on Trust site you must use GIRO corporate account to credit salary.,btohqsg
Well I found a dp that said can work as long it's GIRO transfer.Another dp said FAST transfer or standing instructions (scheduled transfers) will NOT work.But try at your own risk and maybe update us?,btohqsg
So far the only HISA that can accept Fast payment would be UOB. So you have to pair with one must be UOB like UOB/OCBC   UOB/Trust which I am using that. And that is provided UOB dont change the rules in the future,btohqsg
I have a corporate banking account set up recently. But it‚Äôs for a sole prop under my name. I haven‚Äôt set up to pay myself a ‚Äòsalary‚Äô yet  but I wonder if it works. Because if it doesn‚Äôt  I will be wasting giro fees haha,btohqsg
If you have a corporate banking account  you can consider UOB/OCBC setup. If I remember  we can use corporate account to initiate salary transfer and that qualifies. If not  you can use UOB/Trust which Trust require GIRO only.,btohqsg
Yeah sticking with Trust mainly because I really really allergic to OCBC UI haha. UOB I still considering,btohqsg
Hi  does any1 know if flight tickets is eligible for HSBC travel one miles? Didn't seem to receive miles when I bought with the card,btohqsg
Yep posted 2 days ago  but only other transaction I received miles  even those 1 day ago is posted  received miles already,btohqsg
Use UOB as your emergency fund of 150k to earn $500 monthly. For Trust  the good thing is it does not have tier interest  if you qualify for 3.5%  it will apply regardless of the amount. I use my trust account as a holding account. I dont have to think about the limit or which tier.,btohqsg
Only the air ticket 1 seems to not be posted,btohqsg
Or should wait for a few more days?,btohqsg
Should get right away. Which airlines tix is it? Bought from airlines website?,btohqsg
Bought from sq direct  trying to clock the 1k spend since air tickets can hit easily,btohqsg
Maybe will call in tomorrow morning to check with HSBC I guess,btohqsg
Ya call them. Cuz this should be eligible.,btohqsg
Hi all  which Amex card gives cash back for SPBill via app ? Amex TCB or UOB Amex ? Thanks,btohqsg
Both gives  but Amex TCB gives 1.5% while UOB Absolute Amex gives only 0.3%.,btohqsg
Lol I don't get why ppl deletes their message after getting answered.,btohqsg
So it not referring to the sp services right?,btohqsg
Because I do get 1.5% for the amex tcb,btohqsg
Hahah no lah.. i was wondering whether now got a Signature version.... hahaha,btohqsg
Oh he meant metal one haha. Prob confused the name.,btohqsg
But if it is UOB VIM  first year for welcome bonus NTB is pretty worth it. But they have watered down the SUB. Previously there was the grab credits which helped with the higher AF.Comes with unlimited dragonpass which might be attractive for you.ML has an article.,btohqsg
Hi. If I link CIMB VISA Signature to ShopBack  will I get Cashbacks from spending at eligible merchants? Or does CIMB ViSa exclude ShopBack from calculation of minimum spend?,btohqsg
get cashback from both shopback and cimb,btohqsg
Hi  this question isn‚Äôt related but has anyonenotgotten their cash payout of $450?For what I know  the $850 cash payout has already been fully distributed  but what about the $450?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Go gov website to see payout schedule for different mode of payment,btohqsg
Still in August for the $450  but later part of the month perhaps?,btohqsg
Have to ask those who qualify..... this one very hard to get,btohqsg
Did you register your NRIC for PayNow? If yes  are you eligible for it?,btohqsg
I did register my NRIC for PayNow. But I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm eligible as I‚Äôve been receiving cash payouts from the previous GST payouts too. I‚Äôll go do a double check again for the eligibility.Thank you!!,btohqsg
Hello! Need some help cause I'm v confused ü´† Does this mean the 1k miles is expiring? But the overall summary on top shows there's nothing expiring too..,btohqsg
Hi  if I link my amaze card to snapback and do payment through shopbavk do I still get 4 mils per dollar on my citi reward card?,btohqsg
GSTV 2024 will be paid in August 2024 depending on your payment method. You will receive your payment through payNow-NRIC  bank credit and Go cash between 1 August to 21 August. This program includes Cash  MediSave  U-Save  and Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates.,btohqsg
Also depends if you meet the criteria:For GSTV ‚Äì Cash Payout in 2024‚Ä¢ Singapore Citizen residing in Singapore;‚Ä¢ Aged 21 and above in 2024;‚Ä¢ Assessable Income for Year of Assessment 2023 must not exceed $34 000;‚Ä¢ Annual Value (AV) of home (as indicated on NRIC) not exceeding $25 000 as at 31 December 2023; and‚Ä¢ Does not own more than one property.,btohqsg
no need link with amaze. can just link the crmc directly,btohqsg
This means the reward is expiring. You would have to fly scoot to redeem the bonus KF miles from what it seems,btohqsg
Oh. Okay. Thank for the info,btohqsg
Ohh meaning it's unearned (not part of my current balance)?,btohqsg
Hi  users of DBS woman‚Äôs card  what is the max point that we can get assuming that we hit the max limit for bonus points?,btohqsg
Is this 1000 miles on scoot also counted in the total Krisflyer miles or it is in different bucket?,btohqsg
Thanks. I try to use Scoot apps to book next flight  but can‚Äôt seem to find an option for me to utilise the 1000 miles. Any idea how to use it?,btohqsg
For me  the bonus 1000 KF miles came in when my scoot flight miles got posted,btohqsg
No need to do anything extra when booking. As long as the miles for scoot flight get posted before the deadline  they will auto credit the bonus miles to you,btohqsg
I din get the 1000 miles when my scoot flight get posted. ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
Not sure I understood your question. For World Woman  online bonus points applicable for the first S$1500. For Woman  it's the first S$1000.,btohqsg
dbs woman's world mastercard: max 3000 dbs points (6000 miles) for $1500 online spend in calendar monthdbs woman's mastercard: max 1000 dbs points (2000 miles) for $1000 online spend in calendar month,btohqsg
If I booked a flight for someone can I earn kris flyer miles from them?,btohqsg
You earn from cc spend not miles flown.,btohqsg
What about the kris flyer account link,btohqsg
Whoever takes the flight will get kf miles,btohqsg
Ah so I can‚Äôt link my kris flyer account to someone else flight for which I booked for,btohqsg
Cant link unless you two have the exact same name,btohqsg

It‚Äôs very strange that my monthly spending is $2k to $4k online spend  yet I only receive 1000+ points every month! Called up customer service and the person also has no idea why,btohqsg
Maybe use the DBS digibot and check points per transaction to see if any excluded spend?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve done that.. it‚Äôs shows that for every $5 spent  I earn 1 point?,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that states recurring payments (eg. telco) are excluded from citi rewards 10x? Saw some comments here and there but couldn't find it in their TNCUnless it falls under the(iii) bill paymentsexclusion,btohqsg
Correct  you get 1 point for every $5 eligible spend when the transaction post. Then 9x point for the entire calendar month given in lump sum on the 16 of next calendar month,btohqsg
Will the 9x point be reflected in the monthly statement?,btohqsg
For example  I spent $2500 in the past month. Subject to $1500 cap  I would have earned $1500/5x10= 3000points right?,btohqsg
Think you'll still get base points for the excess amount.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôve only received 1000+ points. The previous month I spent $4k  mostly online transactions too. So  I‚Äôm sure I spent beyond the $1.5k cap and should have gotten at least 3000 points.,btohqsg
When checking digibot was there any transaction exceeding $5 dollars earn 0 point?,btohqsg
In that month  I also received only 1000+ points,btohqsg
Of course most transactions will be subjected to rounding,btohqsg
What did you spend on?Is it online transaction?Which date you spend?,btohqsg
Mostly on Fairprice app  ShopBack  grab  Amazon,btohqsg
If the transaction exceeds $5 dollars and you get 0 point means ineligible transaction. No base given then no bonus point in the next month as well for this transaction.,btohqsg
As mentioned  I get 1 point for every $5 that‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
Any transaction under Favepay?Points credited in two batches. Base points credited within few days after transactions and bonus on 16th day next month.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm reading my monthly statement under edocuments. The points are on monthly basis.,btohqsg
Where are u reading your points from?,btohqsg
Ive been in Singapore for 12 months and had a credit card for 6 months payments have been made on time etc,btohqsg
How long does it usually take to get a credit rating?,btohqsg
DBS digibot  log in and ask to view point per transaction,btohqsg
Which bank/credit card is giving good FD rates and have airport lounge access?,btohqsg
Hi can check any recommendation where i can dca $100 monthly into etf at lowest cost and easy to use platform,btohqsg
Can choose from one of thesehttps://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=f4AJoTqAMtvOp5xo,btohqsg
there is no concept of Credit Rating in Singapore for humansonly for companies who want to pay rating agencies for credit ratingif you are referring to Credit Bureau Credit Score  you can start one by applying for a credit facility/card.,btohqsg
I have two..for 6 months already,btohqsg
then you already have a Credit Report in Credit Bureau:https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/buy-my-credit-report.html,btohqsg
did you use your credit cards?,btohqsg
yes  around 6k per month on average,btohqsg
to be clear  you are looking at a recent report that stated you are GX?,btohqsg
usually banks will take at most 1 month delay to upload your data..do you see your bank/card with all the data in your report? all the funny wordings,btohqsg
what are the cards you signed up?,btohqsg
citibank premier mile and american express,btohqsg
My August credit bureau report is showing credit card details as of June 2024.. FYIyes citi and amex definitely feeds data in,btohqsg
Hi.. how u retrieve the credit bureau report? Recently I apply for loan and there is free retrieve report within 30 days so not sure how do I get it,btohqsg

I received this sms.Thanks for registering for our July EGA Bonus Interest promotion! Here's a reminder that your incremental average SGD balances in your Everyday Global Account can receive interest of up to 3.60% p.a. For more info  visit HSBC SG Website > Banking > Everyday Global Account > Additional information. T&Cs apply. SGD deposits are insured up to S$100K by SDIC.Only increment for 3.6%? I thought increment for the additional 1%? Then all the total are 3.6%?I have $17k for July and $150k for Aug. So for Aug  I will have 150k -3.6% + $133k for additional 1%?,btohqsg
Reference Month = June 2024 ADBIncremental = July - June ADBIncremental = August - June ADB,btohqsg
August increment base on June? Not July?,btohqsg
I feel that EGA very confusing and difficult to monitor. üò¢ I shift my ocbc 360 in order can reset to 100k for next month,btohqsg
want the highest rates  must do the most work,btohqsg
I register may-june : June $48kJuly - aug:July -$17kAug -$150kSo July I won't get 3.6%?Aug I only get $150-$48k for the 3.6%? Not base on Aug-july for the incremental?,btohqsg
I plan plan till I very confuseüò¢üò¢,btohqsg
your msg make me very confused.. i not sure what u mean,btohqsg
I locked up in OCBC 3.5% for 88 days  no need to think about it,btohqsg
If you had $48k ADB for JuneAnd you registered in July for the promoJuly = $17k ADBAugust = $150k ADByou will only get 3.6% p.a. each month on the incremental above $48k.,btohqsg
easy but you lose out 1.1% p.a. compared to an account which have to do work,btohqsg
Oh no..:( after I clear end aug  when can I join the next (provided got promo)?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how I get can 60K miles for sining up the Stanchart Journey card?,btohqsg
you can only join HSBC promo when you are not in any cycle.If you enrol for July/August promo  you can only join again in September/October BUT that is unwise since your september balance would earn very little interest as your August MAB is used as reference month.What most people do is:1. rotate 2 humans but i think u don't have2. rest one month. Meaning if you take part in July/August promo  September keep your HSBC empty  and do not do anything. October then you register for October/November promo since your reference month September would be very low MAB.,btohqsg
1 working day for approval. 4 working days to receive the physical card (may differ due to SINGPOST postal/shipping manpower etc),btohqsg
So for your 2  is it something like this Sep - 2k (min balance)   1 Oct (Max amount $x in)   1 Nov draw out $x and then put in max amount $x back in on the same day / a higher $y)? Then 1 Dec draw out everything again leaving 2k balance and have it as the empty month ?,btohqsg
the additional 1.1% is up to $360k only and only for one month  right?,btohqsg
So how do you do it for 2. ?,btohqsg
the additional 1% (no such thing as 1.1%) is for MONTH on MONTH incremental balance.. not related to the 3.6% at all..separate components,btohqsg
you literally said I lose out on additional 1.1%. My point is for me it's too troublesome to get,btohqsg
Reference Month = September. Keep $2k.October = Maximum amountNovember = Maximum amountDecember = Drop back to $2kJanuary sign up againYou can earn 3.6% + 1% in OctoberYou can only earn 3.6%  no 1% in November,btohqsg
oh sorry... yes you lost 1.1% COMPARED to your OCBCand no.. if you do it correct  you can get 4.6% p.a. EVERY MONTH for HSBC EGA  but you need 2 accounts and do work (no free lunch).so it is up to you if you want to earn 30% more interest or just convenient take 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
prior to OCBC  I was at Standard Chartered for three months at 3.5%. I just move around the banks.,btohqsg
Ok thanks for sharing. For all months   need to do +2 k in and 5 transactions ? This is for the giro 1% cashback...and is independent? Nothing to do with your 3.6% or 3.6% + 1% ?,btohqsg
yup... if you want simplicity and ease  then have to stick to the 3.x% accounts.4%+ accounts need to do more work,btohqsg
yes $360k per pair of humans you have. You need 2 humans to get full 4.6% p.a. on $360k.It can scale. If you have 4 humans  you can get $720k earning 4.6% p.a.,btohqsg
what's the minimum age to open an EGA account?,btohqsg
correct. HSBC EGA got a few components as I stated here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/216218Definitely one of the most complex savings accounts out there  but I would say if you understand and got used to it  it is the most rewarding.,btohqsg
So just transfer in 2004Out 2k1111Then 4.6% right?,btohqsg
18 can liao.. this one has no credit card,btohqsg
Out 2k and   $1 4 times,btohqsg
this will qualify you for the 1% incremental bonus and the 1% Giro/Card program (known as Everyday Rewards Program).The 3.x% is another program.But you can be on both at the same time,btohqsg
Oh the out 2k is counted as one transaction ..,btohqsg
U can find in YouTube honey money call as ding dong strategy. Lolx,btohqsg
And the best way to learn is to actually try it out.. make small mistakes then you will learn from it and be more careful.,btohqsg
Means in the empty month with 2k  the cashback can still go on business as usual   correct ?,btohqsg
as long as you meet the TNC of the 1% cashback program,btohqsg
Hi all   how long does it take to for yuu to deposit the bonus points ? And how will the bonus description be ?,btohqsg
On that note  to minimise activity inside  do you transfer in $ each time just before the egiro payment is due or just keep a sum of money inside to clear all bills due for that month ? For the everyday rewards program (1% giro program),btohqsg
whichever method works best for u..won't be the same for everyone because different banks debit different timings later people follow and miss they blame u,btohqsg
for me I transfer in the date of the payment itself...so far have never gotten the date wrong but need to be very aware when each bank deducts.,btohqsg
Just as you spoke  Citibank emailed me üòÇ thank you though! Been great help :),btohqsg
So you transfer in $ on the payment due date and so far ok ? Regardless any day of the week & working / non-working day ?,btohqsg
You can download the app and use the virtual card. Happy spending üòú,btohqsg
Hi guys. Moomoo newbie here. What does it mean that my net assets are 148.88 but i'm only allowed to withdraw 82.49?,btohqsg
yes for me. so far the deduction date is on a weekday,btohqsg
you have a USD100 debit balance,btohqsg
Meaning to say that usd100 is not in any etf now?,btohqsg
meaning you owe moo moo USD100,btohqsg
did you buy some USD security,btohqsg
is this a margin account? looks like the maximum you can withdraw is tied to the maintenance margin on your US securities?,btohqsg

I don't know if this is against the rule here or not. Please delete this message if its against the rule.If i want to borrow money from a lender or bank ( for renovation loan ) will the amount of unsecured credit card and cash line (GXS loan) affect my Chance of getting the loan ? And will it affect the amount i am able to get ?Let's say I have around 15k worth of credit limit on all of my card and cash line and I want to borrow 30k and my annual income is around 33k.,btohqsg
Usually the max loan amount will be based on the following factors1. Whether you have good credit bureau score (e.g. defaulted payments  declare bankrupt  took DRS etc)2. the quantum loan amount that you are applying,btohqsg
Personally  with an annual income of $33k  might be a challenge to secure a loan of $30k from most approved FI under a single name‚Ä¶ but no harm trying firstüôèüèº,btohqsg
I recall dbs has 6x salary for reno loan EIR 6.75% with 33k annual will be tough to loan the 30k,btohqsg
the remaining 8% HSBC promo was credited yesterday.,btohqsg

Hi there  I got the amaze and Citi rewards.1. Came to Realise there is one percent charge after minimum $1000 spending. Is this a new update  or is this something that is previously known ?2. There is a 50 Cent charge for every small charge also  but they put it as 1%. is it still worth it to use this on a daily basis as it city point+insta points afterwards?,btohqsg
It has been there for many months. Minimum 50 cents charge. Only for local spend. And CRMC don't give bonus rewards after 1k also anyway.,btohqsg
no  only bonus saver credit/debit card counted,btohqsg
Instapoints are earned only on foreign currency iirc. And the 1% charge is only for local spends. So it‚Äôs not possible for them to coincide,btohqsg
buy online/offline? how much? which merchant? do a search on heymax/minstant.,btohqsg

Good luck then... You might be liable for fraudulent charges since you didn't dispute it at the first instance. FYI your logon sessions are logged for audit. Cannot pretend you only spotted it tomorrow.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  does everyone know for Citi rewards  when you make an ecommerce refund of eg $200  but your transaction already posted and you earned your points  and the refund just nice only get registered when a new spending month window opens  does it mean the old points get removed (200*10) or in the new window you need 1200 sgd instead of 1000 sgd to max out getting all the points for the new month?,btohqsg

My existing CitiRewards billing cycle is on every 5th and the CSO told me the only other options are 10th/15th. So it would be closest for me to track my CRMC + amaze limit together if I just stick with the 5th ya?,btohqsg
Yeah just stick with that  my is also 5th plus on Citi side is not immediate posting so from 1-5th for the month some transactions might flow over anyway,btohqsg
I would say don‚Äôt have to mind too much  more towards the Citi side is the more of concerns ~If you know you total always below $1k should be goodDue to that you will use direct CRMC instead of amaze + CRMCLike online shopping shopeeOr Favepay / shopback or grab you using CRMC directly instead of using the combo,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask if the Stan Chart Smart Card good for only MRT/bus usage? I am currently using UOB one  and barely hitting the $500/mth requirement.,btohqsg
UOB one would be better if you are already barely hitting $500. You don‚Äôt want to make that lesser. 8.33% if you can hit $500  and 5% thereafter. Not too much different from 6% SC Smart. But it‚Äôs a good alternative if you have already hit $500  and need extra for rides & fast foods since there is no minimum spend. Plus sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there any point to link uob lady card to instarem amaze if i only do local transaction such as grab rides and in store dining?,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your reply. I will still calculate and re-evaluate  cheers,btohqsg
3.33% base cashback (if he hits $500) + 5% additional cashback for bus/mrt,btohqsg
UOB Ladies no point to use amaze for local SGD transactions  unless you just want to track MCC.,btohqsg
Im new to credit cards   can credit cards be added to Ô£ø pay ?,btohqsg
So i can only earn instapoints if i take a grab ride or dine in JB for example. N i have to pay/tab with the amaze card rite?,btohqsg
Oh  the 5% is on specific partners. Thus only the value purchased from these partners. Cannot be added directly to this 3.33%,btohqsg
Yup 0.5 InstaPoint for every 1 SGD spent in foreign currency via your amaze wallet or linked card.,btohqsg
To clarify  the transaction must be charged in foreign currency not sgd rite?,btohqsg
Should be. I have not tried paying in SGD (i.e. DCC) while overseas using Amaze yet  sorry,btohqsg
Oh is it? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve gotten from the videos. Can someone clarify? Thanks,btohqsg
What SW mentioned here with regard to simplygo transactions not included in the 3.33% cashback,btohqsg
Why not if your 500 is made up of this partners?,btohqsg
Actually why did you say that uob one is better if they are barely hitting 500? Means he‚Äôs not even going to get the 3.33%  much less 8.33%,btohqsg
I am assuming that he has an UOB one account to clock as he sounds like he is trying to hit $500. But I could be wrong. Then it would not matter. But if he is already barely hitting $500  why would he spread the spend on another card & lose the interest?,btohqsg

The caption for Chocolate Finance becomes Squirrel Save - just to feedback,btohqsg
Actually I have calculated. Because I realised altho I am spending around $500  I did not manage to hit their criteria for the $500. So basically just getting the 0.05% for the past few months,btohqsg
Around $500 is not $500 unfortunately. You're better off spending on no min spend cards if you can't meet the $500 spending criteria.,btohqsg
What are you spending on? Even insurance counts as bonus interest for uob one account,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if CRMC linked to amaze can earn 4 mpd if I use to pay bills on AXS using the pay+earn option (2.5% service fee)?,btohqsg
Nothing much  I don't eat out often. Just insurance plus transport plus tax,btohqsg
You can buy vouchers to hit if you are close,btohqsg
dun think can even use Amaze on AXS,btohqsg
Hmm ok thanks  I thought amaze is also Mastercard and hence can be used on AXS,btohqsg
CRMC don't earn miles on AXS in the first place,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in the midst of reshuffling around charging of cards and want to ensure I do hit $500pm on on Uob one. So my plan is to buy some Fairprice vouchers to meet the $500 if I fall short.,btohqsg

you can withdraw anytime (end of each month) without penalty. You even get your accrued interest!,btohqsg
How about citi / Maybank cards ?,btohqsg
I think not many people here will spend more than $50k per year using Lady solitaire card because the max rewards is $2k per month. $25k per year is reasonable.,btohqsg
Many of Citi cards exclude travel. Maybe Citi premier miles but not worth it. About Maybank  I'm not sure bout their offerings. Others can comment.,btohqsg
maybe carousell but incur 4.5% fees. Can see if u have other vouchers to buy via heymax instead?,btohqsg

Hi shifus  we make a direct booking (Multiple Booking  1k + 2k) to the hotel website and now is about to make the payment in JPY. I am currently holding UOB KF  UOB Lady (Travel) & a Amaze Card.Theoretically  should I...?1. Link the UOB Lady to Amaze  pay for the 1k booking using Amaze card number online.2. Unlink the UOB lady with Amaze and link it to UOB KF to pay for the 2k booking using Amaze card number online,btohqsg
For the Monthly Average Balance calculation  do we use day-end or day-start for calculation?,btohqsg
Should work. UOB KF only earns base 1.2mpd btw. May be better use something like youtrip or trust.,btohqsg

Hi  anyone know is installments count towards monthly spending for OCBC 360? If for example I use Samsung website installment plan on ocbc infinity card. And do I get cash back for installment plan?,btohqsg
Not sure will extend like before or not.,btohqsg
So just to confirm  even UOB KF + Amaze spent on hotel booking will be 1.3mpd and not 3mpd even though Amaze will convert spending to online,btohqsg
UOB KF never gives 3mpd for online hotel booking. Only 3mpd for naked uob KF on whitelist websites (with 800 spend on SIA group for membership year),btohqsg
If its travel related  will get the bonus 1.8 during the annual fee month bah. I think your case is travel more than online.,btohqsg

2.3mpd for foreign currency vs Youtrip  which one will you choose? üòú,btohqsg
are you team miles or team cash value? üôÇ,btohqsg
i think always need to compare how much you value per miles..@antonio191203I value your choice üòò,btohqsg
Then my value of miles is different from yours how. üòÇI usually dont consider 2.3mpd for fcy. Id use youtrip in that case. Only 3mpd or above  if possible paired with amaze card then i consider miles card.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I tot too  but look at this,btohqsg
Ok i was expecting you to quote the official website cuz 3rd party site will get outdated. I helped u google already. Here you go. Yes can stack.,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm currently looking for a first credit card for miles and have been watching Chris's videos as a guide . Wanted to check out other's opinions as well since i'm relatively new to this.Some background info:- earning median salary- Married - DINK- I have a citi cashback card for petrol & groceries for the cashback- monthly spending never really crosses $1k per person  per month- most expenditure is from eating out and drinking- Looking to save up some miles for travel in the near futureHappy to provide more information!,btohqsg
I cant link successfully on Foodpanda  anyone knows if the redemption rate is exactly the same as the vouchers we redeem inside yuu app?,btohqsg
Gurus  HSBC Premier you don‚Äôt maintain the $200 000 they will downgrade you? I‚Äôm thinking of doing player A&B / Ding Dong.,btohqsg
Click on foodpanda app not website.,btohqsg
Any better redemption rate after linking?,btohqsg
No. I normally use voucher one.,btohqsg
Are you considering any saving acct with cc spend requirement (i.e UOB one and ocbc 360)?,btohqsg
The most common intro miles card is Citi rewards with instarem amaze app so can start from there. If u need to hit cc spend requirement then we can review.,btohqsg
i do have an OCBC 365 account now (is that the same?)! TBH im open to anything at the moment  just need some guidance on where to look and what to look out for,btohqsg
How does this compare to the UOB ladies/ sol? was watching Chris' video on it and it looked pretty good,btohqsg
Cannot. I contacted Trust to ask and they told me this is not offered as a payment option yet in mid July.,btohqsg
uob lady/sol is good only for MCCs under selected categories,btohqsg
depends which option u chose to meet the Total Relationship Balance  easiest is doing $15k transfer in monthly which dun need maintain any balance,btohqsg
vouchers in yuu app have discount,btohqsg
Oh‚Ä¶ I mean most of my spending falls within F&B and drinks/entertainmentIn the alternative  what do you recommend?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I am planning to invest for a period of 3 years minimum. Where would be the best place to invest in.I am not really into stocks so is there any advice in a safe investment which provides a good yield of interest percentage?,btohqsg
These categories won't be covered by 1 single category of UOB lady. I'd suggest citi Rewards for anything online then Citi rewards + instarem amaze for offline spends.,btohqsg
@gregseahbtw  you are going for miles game but do you have any travel plans? if not  miles game is not that good.,btohqsg
ok can. dont use citi rewards for flight/hotel/travel related bookings.,btohqsg
citi rewards exclude travel related for bonus points,btohqsg
Can watch this video first then see of anything fitshttps://youtu.be/QX_9gAZ-agU,btohqsg

Just a quick check   can I ask if I apply thru sing saver  will I have access to the e card immediately,btohqsg
its been awhile since i hold a SC card. First i rmb it took awhile for approval. And I recall they didnt have digital card back then.,btohqsg
My experience when i applied scb smart is that they offered digital card but the options is via temp access id/pw or your cc details. The temp access id+pw need to go down to their branch to get it. Because i am new to scb i got no other cards to login and lazy to go down to their branch. I have to wait for the new card to mailed to me first.,btohqsg

Hi  for those who have used CardUps  can I ask for your opinions?I was calculating to see if it is worth to use CardUp if it was @2.6%Eg. A spending of $10 000Charges for CardUp is 2.6% ($260)If i use a miles card with $1 to 1.4miles  I will get about 14 364 milesSo technically I am spending $260 for 14 364 miles?Did I get this right?So if let‚Äôs say a round trip to Korea - 54k miles  I will need to ‚Äúspend‚Äù $977 on CardUp charges to get a round trip?If this is the case  it is not really ‚Äúworth it‚Äù right? Since booking for flights using miles won‚Äôt be that easy  depends on luck and period.Thankyou! (=,btohqsg

With ur spending  I assume u earn a decent amount. Are you able to get UOB lady sol?,btohqsg
they dont want give me im also using their PRVI to cardup car and insurance monthly,btohqsg
Got it. You are already on UOB so UOB visa signature is natural progress. Just paywave until you hit 2k then switch to other cards.,btohqsg
heyy for UOB visa signature the 2k limit is based on absolute spend? or is the limit based on the bonus UNI$ that you'll get?,btohqsg
UOB VS issit can use like PPV because i called their customer service he tell me shopee grabfood dont have bonus UNI$ and all my petrol aiming for 6mpd through ladys  not sure if can hit min 1k spend anot,btohqsg
For the case of UOB visa sig  both are the same. UOB will add all ur qualified transactions at the end of *statement* month and award uni$. So 2k regardless.,btohqsg
For sgd trnx  UOB VS can only be used for contactless. Use your ppv or Citi rewards for shopee etc.,btohqsg
Ah your ppv spend is not offline? If more online spend then you add dbs women then. 4mpd online at 1.5k cap. Can use to buy air tix and book hotel/activities via OTA.,btohqsg
From what I know  either 1-2k on paywave for sgd transactions  or 1-2k on online/in person foreign currency spend for 4mpd. Petrol is not sure. Please read this article as it‚Äôs fairly complicated cardhttps://milelion.com/2024/03/23/review-uob-visa-signature-card/,btohqsg
my PPV spend is like 300 online 800 offline  if VS can cover the 800 through paywave then i can try apply for it  just worried about their category exclusions cos even their call centre cannot answer my questions,btohqsg
How about directing all paywave offline spend to uob vs? Like from crmc and ppv. If you don't spend 1k offline paywave then dbs women is a good candidate.,btohqsg
ok ill apply and give it a shot  dbs woman points expiry is 1 year isssit and cannot amaze right?,btohqsg
For dbs women yes  it's a good card but those are its quirks.,btohqsg

I read thru but can‚Äôt find any cashback or miles. Funny  when they gave it to me last month  my balance was $0 in June and -$5 in July due to fall back at UOB one. 31 Jul  I max to get Nation promo reward.,btohqsg
the issue is the recent implementation of a 3% foreign payment method fee. heard that topping up to grabpay wallet or paying with cash is the only way to not pay this fee?,btohqsg
I think you are looking at the wrong place. This is on the link i sent earlier. 1.2mpd locally and 2mpd overseas.,btohqsg
Foreign Payment Fee(a) If you choose to pay for any transactions via foreign payment method in the Application  such as using foreign debit cards  foreign credit cards or foreign wallet payments  a foreign payment fee will be charged to account for the additional costs of the Company processing these international payments (‚ÄúForeign Payment Fee‚Äú).seems like youtrip will incur this charge as well,btohqsg
Oof. Previously it was only CC.,btohqsg
if this is the case  you gotta decide money changer spread is better than 3% charge or not. For me personally  i will just use amaze + crmc. got my miles and hsbc ega 1% back :). And dont need to carry so much cash around.,btohqsg
is topping up grabpay wallet (in rm  with youtrip) subjected to this fee also? amaze+crmc was also my method of choice until i heard about this 3% fee thats why looking for a better option now  if it exists,btohqsg

Then what card r u referring to?,btohqsg
If you student u have very limited options for cards  unless u get supp cards,btohqsg
Lol then maybank VI supp card lor,btohqsg
Find mommy daddy to give you supp card,btohqsg
All credit cards have supp cards generally as long as your parents can get,btohqsg
Or u can put down money for a credit card if u have sufficient cash,btohqsg
How does this work ? Im very new to credit cards but i read got alot of perks and wld like to get one üòÖ,btohqsg
"Whats rhe perks for this btw if i use it for paying for ""insurance""",btohqsg
Just go to the bank that u want the card and tell the banker there that u want to apply a credit card and u r willing to put cash down for it,btohqsg
To me putting 10k down for a good credit card is better than any other investment. Jumping through the hoops to get a 5% returns for those high interest savings acct is only $500. But any cashback credit cards surely can get u that $500 in a year,btohqsg
Free limo rides to airport with minimum spend Include miles for insurance spend up to cap per month  I think might have lounge access but not sure cause I use other cards.But I think if u are keen to apply  just go get Citi Prestige with fixed deposit as collateral with Citi bank. That card has good benefits for travel.In the end  it‚Äôs really what you want and need from a card. As a student I wished I knew about Prestige cause I do travel  especially when i went for overseas exchange üòÇ,btohqsg
Student 10k should use for school fee/enrichment course bah. Personal opinion ofc.,btohqsg
If you're a student  you wouldn't even have enough money to hit minimum spend. So no rush to get a CC.CC cashbacks are very minor (in the grand scheme of things) unless you make big purchases.,btohqsg

3.05% for first 100k and 0.05% on next 20k  assuming no other promos.,btohqsg
So they separate 100k give u 3% and 20k on 0.05%,btohqsg
If a person leave 100k there and take out the interest of 3% mthly they are better well off. But must do it mthly which is a tedious thing,btohqsg
That's easiest account already imo. You haven't seen HSBC ega ding dong dance.,btohqsg

Hi..want to ask regarding UOB one card cc scenario.Let say:June I spend $1000July I spend $1000August I got refund from June's transaction $700.Do I need to spend $1700 in August to qualify quarterly bonus $100? Or my bonus will be gone because my June transaction not hit $1000 because of refund transaction?,btohqsg
$1700. If not you'll get $0 cashback.,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs every month Nid to spend $1000 for that quarter? The difference can be rolled over?,btohqsg
My Company can only credit Salary to DBS  is HSBC EGA worth it?#5C002https://youtu.be/lLU1A9odM38,btohqsg
Can still get the lower tier of $50 if spend $1200 in Aug also,btohqsg
this is refund  not roll over,btohqsg
MeansJun $300Jul $1000Aug (1) I can spend $1700 to still get the $100 rebate  or (2) I can spend $700 to get the $50 rebate or (3) i cannot get any rebate at all even for $500 tier as I did not hit minimum $500 for one of the months?My impression is (3). If it‚Äôs (1) or (2)  it‚Äôs good!,btohqsg
Either hit the 500 min spend consistently or don‚Äôt use the card at all imo when it comes to min spend cashback cards.,btohqsg
His refund will go to August spend. So June 1000  July 1000 and August starts with -$700,btohqsg
