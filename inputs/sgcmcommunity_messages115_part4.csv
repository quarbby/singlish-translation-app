Stupid ppl buy an iPad with 4 wheels,btohqsg
Honestly  going back to this  my view is that I don‚Äôt care what you do with yourself and your shit. You can kill yourself if you want  but don‚Äôt do stupid shit when other people are involved. Like man  I want to go home to my family.,btohqsg
Tesla say Tesla lah‚Ä¶why so many words?,btohqsg
oh shit BRO DONT EXPOSE ME,btohqsg
You want? Give me spare car  I whack you,btohqsg
I come out the person in the flipped car die alr,btohqsg
My first accident I was a potato,btohqsg
Takes someone to see shit to know how to react in shit man,btohqsg
Fast and Furious does not count.,btohqsg
I always told myself be calm and stop the car at all cost lah. Im always pre-empting stupid idiots all around me.. like I changing lane speed up High beam me for cutting in?? Jokes on them,btohqsg
Was THIS WHY PIE WAS SO JAMMED YTD THO,btohqsg
It‚Äôs very different when you‚Äôre in the moment,btohqsg
I RMB i in the tunnel NOT MOVING,btohqsg
The first time I spun out  I thought I was prepared for it...,btohqsg
No one lah  it was an empty mountain road  ownself hurt ownself.,btohqsg
the real stupidity is racing in somewhat heavy traffic,btohqsg
Car made it out unscratched but spinning out was quite an experience. First ever,btohqsg
After that  it got easier  but still. Not everyone can react properly in situations like that.,btohqsg
Racing with little traffic is still stupid.,btohqsg
Wait DID THE BMW CHANGE LANE WITHOUT SIGNALLING,btohqsg
yes but the heavy traffic made their alr stupid decision just pure dumb,btohqsg
the lane was clear for him if u ask me,btohqsg
the lancer never slow down even,btohqsg
All accidents are a serious of unfortunate minor events when combined  becomes a big one,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion  if the lancer had just whack and sideswiped the BMW  he wouldn‚Äôt lose control and flip and the BMW would only have one side of damage.,btohqsg
what‚Äôs it gotta do w the bmw tho,btohqsg
I saw the video. Lancer and BMW just both suay go 2nd lane tgt,btohqsg
Bmw like never signal lancer last min saw panic,btohqsg
The wouldn‚Äôt lose control is a big if seeing how he reacted  but better chance.,btohqsg
he had a lot of time to see,btohqsg
Bro  from the video  I can see the BMW do that for like a full 3 seconds at least...,btohqsg
Like ample time to react to it..,btohqsg
You can tell when a car wants to be a charlie bravo from far right?,btohqsg
Some idiots idk why like to drive on the lane markings,btohqsg
I just think everyone are a road hazard,btohqsg
it‚Äôs common knowledge that if you have ample time to slow down there won‚Äôt be an accident,btohqsg
Like cannot assume car is changing lane without signalling or what,btohqsg
Just treat them like they are.,btohqsg
Well expensive lesson for a lancer.. which is prolly stock.. no michelin tyres.. no suspension.. no good brakes,btohqsg
u don‚Äôt need michelins  suspension or good brakes to stop,btohqsg
you see a mentally handicapped child  you don't ask the parent how retarded is the kid,btohqsg
a stock car is supposed to stop as it is,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why he boss and I forever worker sir üò≥,btohqsg
Lancer came from behind at that speed. ZERO DEFENSIVE DRIVING,btohqsg
I see a Smurf blue civic I pull to shoulder on hazard lights,btohqsg
to defend myself i always slow down to speed limit on lane 1,btohqsg
if they come too close i give finger,btohqsg
Xdrive  shld have Awd. S-drive 2WD.Such high CG  I would'veThank God for not flipping.üôè,btohqsg
xdrive usually on the top range models only,btohqsg
Most in Singapore of that gen are red because not the higher specs,btohqsg
