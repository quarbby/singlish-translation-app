So I just got a new Amaze card to pair with citi rewards less than a week ago  and yesterday got a suspicious transaction attempt email (Your transaction at GAMERCRAFT  INC. has been declined due to the wrong expiry date entered. ) Their support just told me to replace the card- but I'm wondering if Amaze is legitimately safe or not. Any of you with similar experience?,btohqsg
Been using it for a long period  never had much issue with it,btohqsg
Sorry can i ask which card is better for buying 10k bill of home appliances at audiohouse? Citi PremierMiles Card ($1=1.2mpd) or Citi cashback+ card (1.6% cashback),btohqsg
there are better cards to use but which do you actually focus on ?do you often travel or frugal which dont travel often. basically if you are a frequent traveller then miles card are better to be used,btohqsg
Miles card like hsbc is good if frugal too . No min spent,btohqsg
If its 1 big transaction  can use citi smrt via kris+ for 5% cashback,btohqsg
Thanks kevin  but for the citibank smrt card  there is an annual cashback cap of S$600 (SMRT$600)  which ends up being a S$50/month cashback cap. In addition  online spend excludes mobile wallet and travel-related transactions. In order to reach the S$50 monthly cap  you need to spend S$1 000 on qualifying categories (groceries  online  taxis).,btohqsg
haha but for my bill  will be 10k at audiohouse,btohqsg
You are not limited to the monthly limit. Like you said  its yearly 600cashback for 12k spend annually,btohqsg
Either you split your bills or just put all on premiere miles or if you will be booking scoot or sq within 1 yr sign for uob krisfyler and earn the 3mikes per dollar,btohqsg

Maybe bnpl just no sure whether audio hse have or not,btohqsg
How to still key in this audiohouse KPAUDIO referral code if I alrdy skipped the referral page when downloading the kris plus app and signing up earlier,btohqsg
hi all! Does using liquid pay with hsbc rev qualifies for 4mpd?,btohqsg

Hihi  just asking for Citibank reward card  the 4mpd reward is capped at 1k each mth.. is there any restriction on how the payment is being made,btohqsg
