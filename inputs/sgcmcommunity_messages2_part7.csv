Mild hybrid is diff from prius hybrid isn't it?,btohqsg
Say real one.. never save until where also.Plus everytime coming to a stop the engine cuts off and it will start again when u coming to a full stop and releasing ur brake pedal a little. its super irritating,btohqsg
Coe high   petrol high   ev road tax so ex . Wonder what car is worth buying now,btohqsg
Yea its different. Prius is full hybrid.Mild hybrid suppose to be like inbetween  but the hybrid doesnt power ur drivetrain,btohqsg
This one next time also COE,btohqsg
The mild hybrid only good for start stop and some small electronics powering. Doenst really contribute significantly to fuel economy,btohqsg
Yes super agree. And doesnt work in singapore.. i cant even let the car coast for long distance.. a little only i need to brake and then accelerate already.,btohqsg
A180 n A200 is a fun drive but engine is using other brand. A3 mild hybrid I actually like it . Power n speed both have bit salesman very niao with package. 320i is actually a better choice. BMW r generally more generous with their package.,btohqsg
A3 mild hybrid is same as my current golf   leon and octavia. Same engine.I didnt like e a3 mild hybrid cos of its driving dynamics,btohqsg
