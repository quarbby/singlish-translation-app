Based on last half yearly results of GEO.- GEO is at slightly over 2x PE wise- 6 months Net profit $106mil- CASH Holdings of $176mil- NAV $0.3758Also  to add . Their recent share-buyback on OCT 3rd  they spent $1 mil to clear 3 levels $0.355 to $0.370. They have plenty of available CASH on hand to protect themselves shareholders from short sellers.,btohqsg
anyway  I only can rem 2021 early last Qtr I'mkeeps complainingwhy my ep near 20c paid div. geo geo not moving and bo give div. gear‚öôÔ∏è already fr. near 30c cheong to 50c on mid Oct '21.. ü§£,btohqsg
ÂéÜÂè≤‰ºö‰∏çÊñ≠ÁöÑÈáçÊºî ‰ΩÜ‰∏çÊòØÁÆÄÂçïÁöÑÈáçÂ§ç.If we looks at past 03 wavebands of gear‚öôÔ∏è  it took approx 2-3wks to drop approx. -30% to -40% once hit ATH..but we're surprised today waveband4 just took one day fr. 92.5c to low 62.5c at fibo 61.8% was approx. -32%,btohqsg
From GEO half year statement  the top 3 customer by country are1) China2) Indonesia3) IndiaBased on the above extracts  we can somehow have a gauge of what to expect in next week results due to the mentioned shortages and increased demand the coal.It all point to the fact that coal demand is still very strong.Note that their NAV increased from $0.3339 to $0.3758 in the corresponding period too.This time round upon results   the NAV should easily go past $0.40 too  IMO.,btohqsg
At a glance  GEO dividends paid out have been consistent and given out on every quarterly since 2021.  Quite amazing  for 3 quarters 2022 they have given 23% yield.Being cash rich  they have no problem paying out dividends and as long as war is ongoing =coal demand still strong  GEO will continue to be a good investment for many.,btohqsg
so wat offer will give ?,btohqsg

Based on delist offer presented  GEAR which closed $0.67 yesterday will open $0.84 to $1.04 later.Considering that short sellers came in yesterday. We might see some big cover happen at the start as they will scurry to cover especially if they are naked or CDP shorts and have not covered back yesterday.GEO will open minimum $0.405 to $0.410 today too based on GEAR offer and GEO will have short squeeze right from the get go .Those who got in yesterday really big bargain and got the nice durians,btohqsg
Illustration on those who opt to open IDX brokerage and accept GEM shares with CashWhich amounts to $1.045/share based on current GEM price.,btohqsg
Illustration of those who decide to accept discount cash consideration of GEM and exit offer (Full Cash amount) of $0.846/share,btohqsg
GEAR offer of $0.84(full cash offer) or $1.04 (GEM shares and cash) where their NAV is $0.4280 with a (trailing PE of 3.5x) puts this offer at more than double the NAV of GEARLet‚Äôs put it into context of their other coal buddyIf GEO (PE of 2x) and NAV of $0.37x does ever get an delist offer  the price should amount to $0.6x as a minimum.Therefore with GEAR offer as generous as it is  GEO is 1 to watch.I believe short sellers for GEAR and GEO got tricked today big time by the news (old IMO) Later will be a big squeeze. GEO results will be solid based on the year end strong demand for coal and I believe we should see $0.45 easily and soon for GEO.Keep GEO in watchlist and buy list as we approach the upcoming results (14th Nov 22),btohqsg
IMO this is the news yesterday that whoever in control used to throw down and scare out shareholders. (Note: Old news as such news have been out before) and if there is money to be earned  who would reject?Furthermore GEO is not affected by this as they as cash cash rich and don‚Äôt need bank funding.One thing the GEAR MMs did today  they flushed and scared out many retailers who could have benefited from this offer but yet cut losses. Unfortunate indeed and unlucky for those who watched todays market. It is not easy to hold the position I would say.Those who didn‚Äôt watch and had no auto SL in place were the winners,btohqsg
Saved by the offer bro. I think might open $0.84 to $0.90,btohqsg
GEAR news leaked  pressed down to accumulate more... GEAR should halt the trading yesterday morning if they are planning for the exit offer. i think they just want to show that their exit offer look nice compared to yesterday closing price,btohqsg
Yup precisely what they did   brutal I say   retailers died and SMART MONEY took over!,btohqsg
No choice   need to make the offer look better,btohqsg
Today short sellsGEO energy$5 454 729.5014 068 100 sharesGEAR$3 222 303.004 437 300 shares,btohqsg
Yesterday some players came to short coal base on the news.I think they gonna help the short squeeze,btohqsg
Then ysday we throw due to fear üò°,btohqsg
If naked short jiu ho say lor,btohqsg
Delist offer 84 to 104...ysday they pick so cheap.. Cunning,btohqsg
GEAR offer options in a nutshell,btohqsg
Sure have one and CDP shorts I believe,btohqsg
Those who shorted GEO based on GEAR also going to kenna big,btohqsg
Sure scared now and panic to cover,btohqsg
Because they know they kenna bluff. They thought the business times news was catalyst but I believe MMs on offerer side managed to get the reporter to throw out the news for them to justify as catalyst to short it down,btohqsg
Seriously well played man I said,btohqsg
Smart money is smart money   different level,btohqsg
GEO to open 405 today . My predictions,btohqsg
I hope no one hurt bad from yesterday man,btohqsg
yesterday  BB using less bullet to short below 85  to attract more panic selling  then they can accumulate more around 60/70 plus. Dirty trick,btohqsg
Ownself short to 85 let market panic throw all e way to 625..big big earn earn,btohqsg
Yup .. total manipulation in play. GEO was forced down to look real in the process. Dirty as coal.,btohqsg
80-90% of retailers would have cut alot got stopped out . Now they in control,btohqsg
Coal is a dirty business  whoever is in needs or know how to get their hands dirty .,btohqsg
Coal price been shooting high yet so many companies can close shops,btohqsg
Suck ppl blood wait for karma,btohqsg
Will the dirty player deliberately make the offer failed after TP from the mkt?,btohqsg
They see gear keep stay 89-92..Áà±Ê≠ª‰∏çËµ∑„ÄÇ„ÄÇanw good tactics üòÇ,btohqsg
if you are looking at the share price plunging   it will be auto-stoploss reaction,btohqsg
cant they just share profit amongst us  who actually make an effort to supported the price above 85 !!,btohqsg
Today trading range should be 78 to 90 cts,btohqsg
Probably above 80c ba since full cash offer is that,btohqsg
Not many small holders will be interested in GEMS shares. So 84 cts discounted back,btohqsg
