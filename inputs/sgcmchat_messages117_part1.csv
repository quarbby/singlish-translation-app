i don't get the appeal of pops and bangs tbvh,btohqsg
mild burbles from actual performance cars? sure,btohqsg
is that in agreement with my point,btohqsg
whoever decided pops and bangs were cool clearly had no ears,btohqsg
Van gogh running burble tune on his horse pulled carriage,btohqsg
there are 3 mods you should never do to your car> (heavily) smoked taillights> static stance> pops and bangs,btohqsg
"van gogh listening to EA888 pops and bangs as he paints ""Starry Night""",btohqsg
maybe thats why he lobbed off his ear,btohqsg
Other then static stance and up badging I disagree,btohqsg
some wanker in a 4 banger AMG popped and banged at our underground carpark last night,btohqsg
but fully tinted out is stupid,btohqsg
and pops and bangs are stupid,btohqsg
the brake lights are red for a reason,btohqsg
not black  not white  not grey,btohqsg
If it suits the paint and design why not,btohqsg
Porsche's optional smoked tails are nice,btohqsg
but smoking it all the way isn't,btohqsg
Bro question is if in sg I don't care if its in other countries,btohqsg

car culture gatekeeping at its best,btohqsg

The V8 really is growing on me as time passes,btohqsg
He got nth better to say alr,btohqsg
but the fun factor is the fact that they do,btohqsg
and they sound magnificent when they do,btohqsg
Why ask for VIN when you should ask for the primary named driver of the insured car? ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg
