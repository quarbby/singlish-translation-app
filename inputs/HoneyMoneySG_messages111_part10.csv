Usually Dbs is 4 working days.Uob is 1 to 2 weeks.Hsbc is 3 weeks.Scb is about 1 week,btohqsg
no need wait   just create ibanking account to activate and spend if got virtual cards,btohqsg
u can start with a cashback card for simplicity sake and work your way up. are you more of a offline or online user?,btohqsg
Can create ibanking account without any cards or savings account with them?,btohqsg
i think minimal need one product with them at least,btohqsg
UOB PPV is a good start,btohqsg
Buying stuffs via Amazon web qualify for uob one 500spending?,btohqsg
guys I have about 30k to park somewhere high interest  liquid or not doesnt matter  any suggestions?,btohqsg
Can be 6mths  1 year also can as long as high interest,btohqsg
Last time i use maybank 12mth time deposit 3.9%  now rate not as high. Low risk perhaps something similar to previous,btohqsg
Too low imo. Or sbs or tbill,btohqsg
Tbh buying gold bars to hold be better choice,btohqsg
Evol would be a great addition. but as others have pointed  you need 3-4 months of payslip. Otherwise  you might have trouble applying for the same product if and only if the product was rejected due to insufficient documentation.,btohqsg
gold better for long long term compare to ssb/tbill those kind? but much more volatile also,btohqsg
Not recommeding or speak for others but my own experience  gold is safest bet.,btohqsg
yes  if u paying using eligible credit/debit card,btohqsg
Are T-bills both ‚Äúcapital & interest guaranteed‚Äù ?,btohqsg
Maybe you try uob evo card,btohqsg
T bills very low interest rate risk if referring to 6 month Singapore t bills,btohqsg
I thought gold price now high already,btohqsg
You try singlife 3%.. I feel is ok,btohqsg
Dont think it will drop anytime soon. Might as well ride the bull,btohqsg
"Is anyone using CardUp to get miles on your ineligible payments? I saw the extra charges are at 2.25% which is significant. Makes me feel like I am ""buying"" those miles. May I know what are your motivations for using CardUp and in what use cases will it be v worth it?",btohqsg
I guess that means MCC codes not in that list of MCC codes would not be eligible for bonus? Example Toys R Us is 5939 which is not in the FAQ list‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Correct. If you don‚Äôt see the MCC under the chosen category means no bonus.,btohqsg
Yes cardup is for you to buy miles. And you can use their calculator to calculate the cost of buying miles. Gen card with good earn rates (1.4-1.6 mpd) and discount code (eg visa for income tax) will make it worth.,btohqsg
My motivation is im buying the miles,btohqsg
is there a cardup vs ipaymy article?,btohqsg
"""Please be informed that we are unable to use digital bank as your bank account for credit salary.""Hi Everyone  my company HR replied that they r unable to add Trust bank for my salary.  Wondering if there anyway I can Giro salary to Trust by myself? Register a company and can juz open a biz account workable  then able to Giro salary to my Trust bank?  Any experience? Much appreciated. Quite wasted if can't Giro salary to Trust as got additional 0.75% bonus interest.",btohqsg
Recently I receive cashback using Trust card  is this something new?,btohqsg
Digital bank is not allow . I think this maybe extended to momoo   singlife and endouws too,btohqsg
have you max out the other bank accounts already?,btohqsg
Yes  if really can't Giro salary to Trust. Then hv to find alternative similar or better to trust.,btohqsg
"If ""most"" companies unable to Giro salary to employee's Digital bank like Trust  then Trust still requires Giro salary  like purposely.",btohqsg
Got OCBC UOB Maribank and GXS.,btohqsg
But your ocbc doesn't have salary credit right? So can credit there and earn interest.,btohqsg
i think what you can look at is cimb fast saver  but it works similar to hsbc ega based on fresh fund then additional 0.5 on salary credit,btohqsg
OCBC can credit salary by FAST now. So no nid giro.,btohqsg
Will check it out. Best would be to able to Giro salary to Trust.  Plus Union member can get 3.5%.,btohqsg
yea digital bank is still pretty much a new area that they havent explore about. i tried asking my company for it too but they mentioned banks with physical presence allowed then bobian  giro into ocbc,btohqsg
name is stated in the picture,btohqsg
Paisey  I wasn't clear. I'm referring to insurance payments  hospital bills  Amaze top ups  etc. Basically those in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
I see. So it's general card with good miles rates + discount codes that will make it worth it. Thanks for sharing.Coz I was using the calculator and my annual expense is roughly ard $50k. Then I saw the admin fee was like $1250 üòÖ,btohqsg
If I empty my account today will that be fine? Instead of yesterday,btohqsg
Because banks refer to their t&c and not someone's else's website.,btohqsg
Yup it all depends on how you value miles. CardUp is for you to buy miles for paying certain ineligible transactions. You always want to capitalise on their promos. 1.78%  1.88%  etc.,btohqsg
You need to top-up more when the promo comes. Your MAB is already minimum of 10k (if you have 150k yesterday). Unless you can turn back time and empty your account yesterday.,btohqsg
Paying for insurance  electric bills etc sp bill  keppel electrics will earn you miles using air miles card and also certain cash back card,btohqsg
"I did mention ""certain ineligible transactions"".",btohqsg
Your baseline will be (day 1 + day 2) / 30 days if you empty it today.Eg. Your end day account balance is $100k yesterday.Your Jun MAB in will be ($100k x 2) / 30 days = $6666.67,btohqsg
