Have checked. Not mentioned in T&Cs,btohqsg
Kept separate on the back end  but can be pooled together for the purpose of redemption. Earliest expiring points are redeemed first (e.g. WWMC) followed by non-expiring points (e.g. Altitude). If you cancel  all unredeemed points accrued to that card are lost.,btohqsg

Is there a minimum amount? So in short   just paynow or do fast from posb can?,btohqsg
Some merchant doesn't work actually. I paid $0.1 to Dian xiao er early last week using Shopback pay and thinking to redeem the $4.x Shopback cashback. This week log into iBanking and found out the $0.1 was reversed by the merchant.. And in Shopback I can't find the trace of my $4.x cashback any more.. ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Call ShopBack to refund it to you  can?,btohqsg
haha but need to be careful in explaining else who knows how much stricter they will be when getting the cashback,btohqsg
Perhaps wait for one week when their account cannot tally  they will auto refund to you.,btohqsg
Nvm. I lost MUCH MUCH MUCH more with Shopback before. Got tired to deal with their customer service. It is just a DP that I shared  that $0.1 method may not always work. In fact I paid 2 merchants for $0.1 that day. One worked  the other reversed back 2 days later.,btohqsg
You can consider gogoenergy too... some cards can get 4 miles,btohqsg
Hi about HSBC EGA  do i need to deposit every month until Aug in order ro get the 4.3% interest? Or can i deposit 1 time ( like 50k this month) ?,btohqsg
Already answered the math problem on time,btohqsg
assuming u sms register in May (and did not register between Feb to Apr)  reference month Apr has $0  can enjoy 4.3% interest for average daily balance each month from May till Aug,btohqsg
Yes i registered via sms on May. So you mean i need to deposit atleats 2k every month until Aug. I cant just deposit a 50k 1 time this month? Sorry if mynunderstading is not right. Thnx,btohqsg
can just deposit $50k in may,btohqsg
I have a dumb question but do we need to pay tax for interest earned by fixed deposit?,btohqsg
Hi  Amaze paired with CRMC  can we use Amaze to transact over hotel (which is excluded for CRMC)?,btohqsg
Amaze is only a proxy that convert yr payment to online. But the MCC is still the one that decide whether u get rebate for yr CRMC. I am looking for a master card that have no min spent and can be use for oversea travel and dinner.,btohqsg
Most of my card are visa ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Why do ppl recommend using CRMC + Amaze for kris+? Just because it is eligible for MC promotions?,btohqsg
Thank you. In short cannot  even it is online transaction  the MCC will still be registered.,btohqsg
Anyone have experience in requesting credit limit increase for CIMB? I had sent in my income statement and NOA. They rejected my request twice and still given me only one month credit,btohqsg
Means u are a big risk for non repayment of unsecured loans,btohqsg
Donâ€™t worry Cimb is just â€˜very conservativeâ€™ they rejected my CC application lol! While UOB gave me 80k balance transfer for CC,btohqsg
Cimb looks at your total limits approved across all FIs.,btohqsg
Anybody know the best miles card for Travel spending (IShopchangi),btohqsg
Hi can I ask if you have UOB ladyâ€™s card  what is a good complimentary credit cad,btohqsg
Worst banking experience ever actually. Wouldnt use their card since any bank out there provide 10x better alternatives,btohqsg
Its okay dragon pass i will buy moiself instead of thru the card,btohqsg
Hsbc travel card dragon pass too,btohqsg
Need to be $120k to get right?,btohqsg
Did someone recommend to use Amaze CRMC combo on Kris+? This needs Amaze to be added into Google Pay. But I remember watching a video saying CRMC does not aware points for Mobile Wallet which I confirm from T&C. So this way of using Kris+ won't work.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Ermmm not sure. Many years ago get.,btohqsg
iirc only the CIMB VI got free DragonPass,btohqsg
Does giro payment treated as online payment for credit card?,btohqsg
So can simply add CRMC into Google Pay is enough. No need to go through Amaze when using Kris+,btohqsg
you need amaze because CRMC excludes Google Pay payment methods,btohqsg
i was told by hsbc banking hotline that after the 4 months of high interest  can just apply via sms again on the 5th month  then will get high interest again for another 4 months. Was told that there is no need to transfer out on the 5th month and then apply for ega high interest again on the 6th month. Anyone can confirm based on their experience?,btohqsg
Wonâ€™t work. Because the new reference month is your 4th month balance which is still high.,btohqsg
The officer is not wrong actually. U will indeed get high interest again for the next 4 months. Just that itâ€™s on incremental balances! Half truth!,btohqsg
the purpose of transferring out is to reset the reference month back to a low amount.,btohqsg
Would like to check if I use uob preferred platinum visa to pay wedding hotel on contactless i will earn 4 miles right  if I pay through online payment link to the hotel I will not earn 4 mils right?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m on ocbc 360 account and using ocbc TR card  if I pair TR to amaze for overseas  will the usage of Amaze count towards minimum spend of $500 for 0.6% interest?,btohqsg
Yes also means  both ways will earn the miles ?,btohqsg
Sorry  what I mean is  you are correct: online won't earn miles  as it's not on the whitelist. Contactless will earn miles as long as the MCC is not on the blacklist.,btohqsg
