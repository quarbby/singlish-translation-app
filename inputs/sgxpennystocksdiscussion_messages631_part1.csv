Hatten no stamina lah  up 4 pips exhausted liao,btohqsg
moved so fast... see how tomorrow,btohqsg
Wow Amos Group close $0.199. Its time.,btohqsg
At current price  Amos group Market cap is only $25mil.Based on the latest balance sheet - Cash and equivalent is $14m- Net Assets $104.9 mil.Undervalued indeed. I hope they find a buyer and sell off the company to a bigger player  even at a discounted NAV of $0.30 to $0.40  would be good for many recent holders.Shawkweii partners (controlling shareholder of Amos at over 80% stake) has ability to do just that and I believe it is a possibility based on their track records. Perhaps  that is why they did the share consolidation because who would buy over a micro penny counter at $0.01xDYODD.,btohqsg
Re Cap on Amos. 2 weeks back Amos was 145 - 160 range.,btohqsg
Wah lao  Amos Directors ownself buy..,btohqsg
U sell me I sell u,btohqsg
coming to $0.20 mean Amos Group is ready.,btohqsg
No bro  the BBs stucked for some time. they were caught off guard by Danny Lien selling when he took $3m from open market.,btohqsg
Your price so good  just put aside and keep long term,btohqsg
BBs coming back now that they know Danny and Teo family no longer selling.,btohqsg
their average costs should be $0.3x .Theres room for chiong,btohqsg
that shld be the end for amos ?,btohqsg
cannot... I am starting to sell all and keep cash,btohqsg
Amos Group ($0.161)Since Oilies in play  perhaps this forgotten hero can start its engine. Currently cheap but illiquid. I reckon for those who stucked earlier  now might be a good time to average down since Oilies will be super hot this period.The counter will only come in play once they go above $0.20.Currently  market cap only at $27mil whereby- Cash balance of $14mil- property  plant and equipment of $69mil- NAV at $0.67Also  last time round when insiders Danny Lien sold and took back few millions $$$ from market  the BBs absorbed his selling big time .I guess the time is now if they ever wants to get  they need to strike what the oil prices are hot and rising !DYODD.#prayforamosgroup,btohqsg
Inflation leh  keep cash how to keep up with inflation,btohqsg
penny still can play... but not blue chips,btohqsg
But Sg market won't crash so badly  right?,btohqsg
Called Amos recently when it was $0.161. Now $0.199 and near to the liquidity area (above $0.20)yesterday and today most of the buying is BBs averaging into their earlier stucked position ($0.3x),btohqsg
they must bring higher then liquidity comes in,btohqsg
SG always kenna from left right bottom,btohqsg
I expecting an inital drop of 30-40%,btohqsg
of course this is just my guess lar,btohqsg
