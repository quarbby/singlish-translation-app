Actual cost of battery and labour cost: $5Knowing what's the correct battery  how to open the remote  having the battery in stock: $25Not knowing how the service industry works and calling others kum gong: worthless,btohqsg
it's amazing how lazy people can be,btohqsg
if we were talking about changing stuff like new mounts or other mechanical parts  i would completely understand if the customer doesnt know what parts they need.But its batteries… batteries that can be bought from supermarket or mama shop… and it can be changed so easily,btohqsg
Furthermore  those who zhng cars should know workshops always charge a premium. Its always cheaper to source for parts yourself. If there is a cheaper way to do things you wont do it?Im quite sure the fact that Mr Pete Aka Xan Aka Tio can chat on telegram  he has access to Google and Youtube which teaches how to change batteries for Key fobs.,btohqsg
Unless… he really kum gong lor😂😂😂,btohqsg
I agree  it's not that difficult to do some research or even just look at your remote and try to figure out how to open it up to access the battery compartment. Personally I have always changed the battery by myself. But not everyone is the same. Some people don't care and have money to burn. Others feel that their time is worth more doing other things than learning how to change the batteries by themselves. They let the workshop earn  the workshop happy  they also happy. What right do you have to call them kum gong?,btohqsg
my brother in christ  you have no idea who you are defending sir,btohqsg
you are defending a clown who claims to pump 95 in his 80L tank,btohqsg

we understand where u coming from but anyway it was kinda of an inside joke  in case u are new or not active here. Cos the pete guy was a degrading soab and claiming this and that so some of us just tease him for the fun of it. no offense intended to anyone else except to him,btohqsg

otherwise we usually are a knowledgeable  enthusiastic bunch of car lovers. just start a porsche talk here,btohqsg
not saying that i know everything but the answers of the guys you are defending is actually retarded,btohqsg
Maybe rant about how the COE and vehicle tax structure sucks?,btohqsg
cmon man  look at this hypocrite,btohqsg
I'll admit I don't know all the details and backstory but it felt really aggressive to me when I see a reply that's just the 2 words kum gong and nothing else,btohqsg
It goes back down to whats the purpose of taxes and coe,btohqsg
I apologise on behalf of whoever said that to you@FireflyHM. Everyone here assumes a new person is pete for some reason - J,btohqsg
What's the purpose of ARF? To artificially inflate the cost of ownership?,btohqsg
General Knowledge  you should know how bad the jams are like in cities like Bangkok and Jakarta. If we do not put in taxes  we will end up like them,btohqsg
That's what COE is supposed to do. Not ARF,btohqsg
so we could throw away the arf  and make coe 200-300k?,btohqsg
isnt arf a type of progressive tax?,btohqsg
wont it be more fair to those who choose to drive vios and attrage and other basic cars?,btohqsg
COE doesn’t stop jams because it only stops purchase not usage. Fuel duty and ERP is what stops jams. COE only increases inflation,btohqsg
Okay so what happens if you take away coe? does ownership increase drastically?,btohqsg
There must still be some form of tax in place to reduce jam right?,btohqsg
So we are assuming people buy cars like attrage for 40k  and leave it at home?,btohqsg
ARF serves no purpose other than to artificially inflate the cost of ownership and for the gov to take money back from the people but I digress.COE is supposed to regulate the total number of vehicles on the road but it's inherently flawed which is causing the current COE sky high record bids. I'm not saying that the COE system is bad. I'm saying that how it's being executed now is bad.As for congestion  ERP and the proposed next gen GPS road tax is on the right track,btohqsg
For the sake of argument  If driving that 40k car costs $50 each time  people will only drive when they really have to,btohqsg
Have a look at this too,btohqsg
then what about those who needs to use the car everyday?also  we are land scarce country  if every household have 1-2 more cars on average  not sure where we are gonna park the cars,btohqsg
i totally agree with you on the last point. The GPS road tax / new gen ERP is much better,btohqsg
so how do you want to change the coe system?,btohqsg
E.g. for COE: The premise was that everyone submitted their own bids according to what they could afford. If you needed a car badly  you can up your bid for a better chance. People who can wait can just bid lower.But the reality of it is that nobody actually bids on their own. Everyone leaves it up to the car dealerships to bid on their behalf. The car dealerships have no impetus to drive down the COE prices. In fact it is beneficial to them to drive it up because you will have to take a bigger loan and their salespeople can earn more commission. I'm willing to bet that most people don't know that you can bid for COE by yourself.,btohqsg
Then you will say  I got no cash to pay for the COE I bid how? Here's a thought exercise. If everyone bid for COE themselves  how much do you think a COE would cost?,btohqsg
Car rental companies have ton of cash as they profit off the cars,btohqsg
dont you think the price will continue to increase again?,btohqsg
If people are willing to pay 100k for coe now  when you leave it to the free market  why would they not be willing to pay 100k too?,btohqsg
LTA is making car rental companies rich at the expense of Singaporeans with the current COE system,btohqsg
this is quite flawed too. in the event people continue to flood the roads with $50 a day  LTA will then raise the $50 to $75 and then to $80. Until there is less congestion  Singapore will always increase the price of ownership.,btohqsg
No  because you decouple the COE from purchase of the car already. Remember that you have up to 6 months to register a car with the COE that you successfully bid. So you could take your own sweet time to bid and after you get your COE then go to dealer to order/book car.,btohqsg
Batteries that have the exact code for them on the battery itself  take out from the remote you know already which one you need,btohqsg
so there will be leftover from the previous 6 months who failed to successfully bid and need to bid immediately right? so there will still be a large demand who needs/want their car immediately. So the demand will still be sustained.,btohqsg
I think luxury brand willing to bid high just to secure their customers because they have budget. My friend initially thought he wouldn't have gotten his after the car show w what the dealers agreed to bid for him upon signing. But they made a 11th minute bump and secure the coe for him.,btohqsg
Yes but the issue is  the man you are defending calls people kum gong for pumping petrol in Singapore...,btohqsg
the problem  singaporeans are too rich,btohqsg
Its cyclical. Last cheaper COEs were 2008 and 2018. I think price will continue to stay high until 2027-28 unless it's perverted by increasing interest rates (which might bring the cycle shorter say2024-2025?),btohqsg
I assume you know how the COE system works?,btohqsg
of course  its very much driven by the rich people sir… self bidding will not help,btohqsg
to the 600 lucky people every month  the can afford to pay 100k now  they can afford to pay 100k next time,btohqsg
there will also be 1000 people who are willing to pay 90k now  willing to pay 90k next time,btohqsg
Except that right now we have no control at all because the dealerships are doing the bidding  not individuals.,btohqsg
Just because there are people who can afford 100k COEs doesn't mean that they want to pay that much,btohqsg
There are rich people who don't bat an eye on coe but I'm sure there're still 80% of us who hawks the coe. But same time median salary YoY is growing. Car is still an aspiration to most and assuming everyone does financial planning  say factor 15%-20% of month salary to car  think 30y COE band will only continue to reach higher highs and higher lows like an ascending channel,btohqsg
i agree with you sir  but whats the solution? as alex has suggested  ownself bidding wont solve anything?,btohqsg
they are required to sir… thats how a bidding work,btohqsg
Self bidding might help (abit) because we bid w their own hard earned  w emotions. Dealers bid to secure you.,btohqsg
if you put the price at 90k then it will exceed the quota?,btohqsg
in that case  wont get to play the system of buying at a low and when coe is high,btohqsg
No one wants to pay anything  everyone would like everything to be free but that's not how life works sir,btohqsg
I doubt lower lows as the government does decrease the total pqp as well,btohqsg
My point exactly. If you know that you can get COE cheaper  why would you want to spend more money?,btohqsg
It also appears that most people don't realise how the COE system works,btohqsg
Ok and you bid with emotions and want COE  say a guy who has 5 cars coming in the next month comes in and blindly bids up to a certain amount and there's a few of these people,btohqsg
They will drive the price up quite high,btohqsg
And I doubt a lot of benefit will come from self bidding because to a dealer as well getting COE at a lower price is beneficial because for their customer they give you a roughly fixed price for COE and the car,btohqsg
The price of COE you see every 2 weeks is actually the lowest successful bid. Everyone who bidded higher than that price  pays exactly the same price even if they bidded 10x,btohqsg
If they manager to secure the COE at a lower price  it's a higher margin for them,btohqsg
No worries! Hope you find someone to deliver your parcel!,btohqsg
I like how change battery from key fob suddenly became coe,btohqsg
2022 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Saloon 2.0 Plug-in Hybrid E300e Avantgarde ReviewThe Mercedes-Benz E300e takes advantage of its plug-in hybrid drivetrain to provide an all-rounded driving experience - powerful  comfortable  and efficient.But in a world headed for zero emissions  can it beat its stiff competition?Watch the review herehttp://bit.ly/3OfqXNK,btohqsg
E.g. this bidding exercise has say 100 cat A and 1000 people bidding. As the day progresses  the bid of the 100th person is shown as the COE price. Person 101 and below will up their bids to surpass person 101  eventually driving up the price. But because some people will give up because the price is beyond what they feel is reasonable or what they can afford  the COE prices will not be as high as it is now because there will be people who are willing to wait and not fight like the dealerships because they need to secure COEs to fulfill their customers car orders,btohqsg
Ok but those people that give up,btohqsg
Do they still not want cars?,btohqsg
And use it on cars they're selling......,btohqsg
You self bid also for the same number of cars being sold,btohqsg
demand increase at a lower price,btohqsg
Your demand is just shifting from people walking away from buying a car at a dealership to people walking away from COE bidding because too expensive,btohqsg
Those who want will still bid,btohqsg
The point is  because you can hold a COE for up to 6 months before registering a car  you have plenty of time to bid in advance and secure your COE before ordering a car from the dealership,btohqsg
so how does this lead to lower coe? you still have to bid for coe right?,btohqsg
Yes you still have to bid  but how many people are willing to bid 100k? Remember that now you don't have a loan to cover cost of the COE.,btohqsg
Okay  so if you dont bid  you just wait and wait and wait and wait until it drops… but what if it doesnt? cos there are many people still willing to bid at 100k,btohqsg
coe is a self stabilizing mechanism,btohqsg
"You find me one person willing to fork out 100k cash for a piece of ""paper"" that you never even see",btohqsg

Stand outside Mercedes and bmw dealer,btohqsg
😂😂😂😂 i know of people who pay 900k for a 911 with the car still in the UK. never even seen a photo of the car  just the spec sheet.,btohqsg
I know someone willing to buy 400k car in Australia only to go use it after 2 years,btohqsg
I'm saying that right now people think they have no choice but to eat the price of COE at whatever the bidding results are. But actually they can take back the power from the car dealerships by bidding for COE themselves and actually affect the price,btohqsg
Ok let's say I buy a car,btohqsg
Then I want to secure COE myself,btohqsg
so if we take out the dealership… doesnt change the fact that people are still willing to bid at 100k?,btohqsg
Then I have 6 months before the car arrives to go buy,btohqsg
Because people are willing to bid higher than me as supply limited  demand high,btohqsg
Now I have to pay for the car to the dealer and leave it unregged or let go of the unit and wait for a few months for another to arrive,btohqsg
Now a year has gone by,btohqsg
And I bite the bullet and pay for whatever price the market is paying for COE,btohqsg
Maybe save 5k to 10k based on monthly bidding fluctuations,btohqsg
But I have now waited an extra year for a car for no reason,btohqsg
Just say don't want to the dealership,btohqsg
If I bid for COE myself,btohqsg
Just that with the latter you are wasting more time with paperwork  sitting and bidding  understanding the auction,btohqsg
When I can just pay basically the same thing to a dealer to work for me,btohqsg
Whose COE price I can reject because most offer multiple bids for COE,btohqsg
What brands can I not do it with?,btohqsg

is it common for DSG car to rollback/reverse on upslope? was exiting ccp carpark and while queuing to exit  removed feet from brake  and car suddenly reversed  luckily applied break in time and didnt hit car behind.,btohqsg
Engine auto stop? Not enough power to hold upslope? Clutch worn? Could be any of those reasons.,btohqsg
But also  a slight roll is not uncommon  and on a slope a slight roll can feel like a big roll. Mine sometimes roll a quarter of an inch maybe  but usually happens when I’m only just coming to a stop and have to go again,btohqsg
I believe its common for auto tran cars (mine is not a DSG and it rolls too) unless it's newer cars that come with Hill Hold Control. It prevents the car from rolling backwards on slopes.,btohqsg
Mine has that but sometimes it doesn’t engage especially when I’m not at a full stop and rolls back but just a bit until the tranny catches,btohqsg
Looks yes but i imagine Shiok only leh can enjoy the car with roof down especially at nights!  Haiyah have to save more money,btohqsg
Oh...did u turn on the HHC? I think its turned ON by default.,btohqsg
It’s on but only engages when I come to a complete stop  which I don’t sometimes,btohqsg
Sometimes…I ride the clutch 🤣🤣🤣 and just hold the gas,btohqsg
Especially when the VTEC kicks in! Oh wait.. the V8 I mean 😉😉 talk too much to@awj_moodliao,btohqsg
I shan’t even pretend to understand what that means!,btohqsg
Oh well I just don’t brake and ever so slightly press the gas so that I don’t roll back but don’t move forward,btohqsg
Oh I see...I guess that's how the system works...😁,btohqsg
Yeah  gantry things sometimes. Gantry is not slow enough for me to come to a full stop  but slow enough for me to not be able to slow crawl past it up a slope 🤣,btohqsg
But my car cannot roof down.,btohqsg
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE A STINGER VERT! Shiok only!!!,btohqsg
WOW. your driving skills must be top level,btohqsg
No more damp and mouldy pits,btohqsg
yes the occasional night drive when its breezy  but after a while  the novelty wears off for me. too much wind noise at speed haha,btohqsg
vanos  vtech  same same but different,btohqsg
Sign you drive too fast sir 🤣🤣,btohqsg
A very cleverly engineered piece of hardware,btohqsg
not if it reliably delivers what is meant to,btohqsg
After driving an ev   most of the control of pattern learn in schoolIs all irrelevant,btohqsg
question  when u do regenerative braking  or let off the accelerator  does the brake light come on?,btohqsg
That why I notice some ppl think I am doing brake check on them,btohqsg
yesterday i was driving behind a model y  it slowed down significantly but no brake lights on,btohqsg
the regen can be turned off?,btohqsg
Have   when we jam brake it will be flashing brake light instead,btohqsg
And it is the best feature,btohqsg
oh yesterday was a slow roll to the traffic light  but maybe i wasnt paying attention,btohqsg
ya i heard the 1 pedal drive makes driving a lot easier,btohqsg
I also mean in terms of charging,btohqsg
haha slow roll cos model y want to u turn  and i focusing on the green arrow,btohqsg
Because many traffic lights so you're bound to step off,btohqsg
I always roll my car slowly near traffic light,btohqsg
But some pplAround me willl no patience,btohqsg
Will either tail gate me or go infront of me or beside me and said my car is slow,btohqsg
I don’t have a charging station at my condo 🤣,btohqsg
Although hdb carparks are starting to get charging stations,btohqsg
Many condos and the management at the condos are against the installation of charging stations,btohqsg
Even if an EV owner chooses to bear the cost of it,btohqsg
I don’t own it lah  my opinions doesn’t matter,btohqsg
Soon law passs down all got to do also,btohqsg
I heard of one club last time do eogm,btohqsg
Then the committee never show up,btohqsg
Those who stay in condo preferred to burn 🔥,btohqsg
EV more hazardous due to battery burning and cause the insurance premiums to go up in the private estates,btohqsg
Just wait for gov to mandate. For now just enjoy the ICE,btohqsg
Your home insurnace went up ?,btohqsg
All relative. Old condos all don’t do such things and hope for enbloc lah,btohqsg
Nothing to do with individual housing insurance but the mcst ones,btohqsg
Mine all risk necer go up with public liability,btohqsg
All risk insurance on a building,btohqsg
And those buildings have EV charging points already?,btohqsg
Insurance also never ask about it,btohqsg
Your mcst tell u increase ?,btohqsg
If so maybe ask them change insurance,btohqsg
First they will ask for higher MF/SF  then no one want to pay lor.,btohqsg
Better off moving to newer estates that will come with the ev chargers.,btohqsg
That’s why one must be prepared to pay to have something that not everyone wants,btohqsg
What is insurance mf or sf,btohqsg
You stay in condo and you dunno mf/sf acronym?,btohqsg
U mean condo sinkie fund ?,btohqsg
Why they will ask for higher,btohqsg
Maintenance long term is not free leh.,btohqsg
They charge 50% cent a kilowatt,btohqsg
So interesting. What to do with residents who leave their fully charged cars in the charging lots overnight ah,btohqsg
Need so much paperwork and permission to do some stuff,btohqsg
Million dollar for a 4 room,btohqsg
Already parking issues within condo already a sticking issues many years for those overcrowded,btohqsg
Free installation but electricity bills how?,btohqsg
But I’m sure condo residents who are so rich and educated all sure will be very civic conscious and come down move their cars out of the lots and to other lots so as to let other needy people use,btohqsg
The provider charge the user 50 cents a kilowatt,btohqsg
Then your mcst monthly can bill the provider,btohqsg
That’s the hopeful. Until you have some exceptional cases,btohqsg
How many lots enough ah for ev cars?,btohqsg
Even unker driving bentley can chide security guards,btohqsg
I’m sure. Singapore people all so educated and nice one I see,btohqsg
The provider will have the details of kw used and who is charging,btohqsg
Especially those drive conti cars one all,btohqsg
So rich. Sure got class and civic consciousness gao gao one.,btohqsg
Who doing that admin work? All asking for increase budget.,btohqsg
Sent an invoice is that hard Meh,btohqsg
this i know. Worked with a few vendors before,btohqsg
Yes. Definitely those staying in prime locations like orchard area are having class,btohqsg
I think all condo residents sure got class one,btohqsg
No la lol can’t said like this,btohqsg
Car charged faster come down and move the car to make room for other residents,btohqsg
Tell me about it… some think their money big fark,btohqsg
Don’t leave there and hog (and go business trip or holiday),btohqsg
Actually most ppl is no money is act got money that got problem,btohqsg
Until i throw them the legal letters then all shrink,btohqsg
Ya. See who can afford to waste,btohqsg
Come back find car clamped then cry mother cry father how dare MCST clamp when they also pay maintenance,btohqsg
This is such a classic example,btohqsg
Real rich won’t act one lah,btohqsg
Some are really humble. I respect,btohqsg
It’s those empty vessels who make the loudest noises,btohqsg
And stomp guard house  or MCST office and start raising voices at people,btohqsg
Actually not willing to pay having EV charging is they can’t afford lah.,btohqsg
It just like enforcer giving summon u see those rich 1 see enforcer give summon,btohqsg
I told my friends  those staying condo and still giam  is worse off than those staying in hdb,btohqsg
Coz they know they in the wrong and steady mah,btohqsg
Ya and the $75 is like tips,btohqsg
I on wp also sir so I don’t want to say local or non local leh heheh,btohqsg
Like those anyhow park at road sides? 😛,btohqsg
HANOR. Dare to do  dare to face consequences lah,btohqsg
Anyway  wait for gov to put mandate and all diam diam.,btohqsg
I see don’t know how many like show off things like pop pop bang bang  then when authorities come they run like mice  or worse  complain why authorities so strict lah  blah blah blah,btohqsg
Cause the consequences is their cars can be compounded,btohqsg
Suddenly voice (and car) not so loud,btohqsg
Everything has a price sir kekekek,btohqsg
Not the LTA Officer in Singapore!,btohqsg
Those conti cars kenna bang also cried babies too.,btohqsg
Brave rain and Sun to keep our roads safe!,btohqsg
Insurance must pay else cannot afford repairs,btohqsg
LOOK I CAN FLOOR ACCELERATOR AND GO RACE HERE AND THERE. EVEN GO SEPANG!,btohqsg
I vote for COE to be decoupled from car prices in taking loans to cover that,btohqsg
Actually beside too noisy I prefer ppl like them lol to high performance ev,btohqsg
then when accident happen  cook up story say this say that and hope video never capture,btohqsg
At least u know they are coming and see the car u know is Chiongster,btohqsg
Make it a case because the greater society ends up paying for these people,btohqsg
Depending how many times they can claim?,btohqsg
So many insurance companies pop up these recent years.,btohqsg
Poor citizens too with the increase gst,btohqsg
Whatever rebates are just an insult to poor,btohqsg
Workshops love insurance. Can claim gao gao,btohqsg
Hope their surveyors do their job,btohqsg
That is only one instance sir,btohqsg
All only want to hear good things not bad.,btohqsg
Anything that cost money become a nemesis to the bosses,btohqsg
Unless they see opportunity to gain,btohqsg
I wonder how much i have been paying car insurance without claiming… 😏,btohqsg
These days  people are into renting more than owning.,btohqsg
Oh man. Reminds me of that BlueSG case,btohqsg
Then later these bluesg will come and use (hog) the condo ev chargers. 😛,btohqsg
Yes… we need to be empathetic 😊,btohqsg
And there is always another side of the coin. 🙃,btohqsg
Better save yourself from agony by not having to participate those dealings,btohqsg
It’s like 69. Don’t forget to flip around sometimes.,btohqsg
I always on a lookout for these VRNs,btohqsg
Some actively participate and gain… so totally happy and no agony leh!!!!!,btohqsg
Oh yes me too. Buy toto kekekek,btohqsg
Ermmm. 69 is not a number in toto. If you split them  they are not coupling,btohqsg
Toyota premieres the sharp looking  all new Prius in Japan🇯🇵Toyota🇯🇵 has unveiled the all new Toyota Prius globally  with Series Parallel Hybrid (HEV) models to launch around the end of this year and Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) models to launch in spring 2023.The new Prius now possesses more stylish proportions through a low centre of gravity and large-diameter 19-inch wheels.It's looking pretty darn good wouldn't you say? 😍Read the full article herehttp://bit.ly/3AlLCKA,btohqsg
toyota finally up their game. the new sienta looks worlds apart from the predecessor,btohqsg
Just today. Not saying anything but yes… accidents do happen to everyone…,btohqsg
old car not gone where got new one,btohqsg
Rip to this guy's bank account,btohqsg
Around 6.2k for over 22 years of age and more than 2 years driving experience,btohqsg
For excess own and third party,btohqsg
But if there's no third party claim  only 3.2k,btohqsg
Plus loss of income for both cases,btohqsg
that is provided by the guy paid for accident protection beforehand.. i think,btohqsg
No this one without the cdw,btohqsg

More like stage 4 nano ionization,btohqsg
stage 4 like cancer sia walau,btohqsg
Stage 4 is the last state of tuning for most cars. What’s modified for a tune to be classed as stage 4 is open to interpretation  but at the very least  it is here that an upgraded turbocharger/ supercharger  such as a hybrid turbo  is installed. Along with that  most tuning companies will also install a re-circulating dump valve and enlarged  ported wastegate.Stage 4 may also include an upgraded oil cooler  multi-hole injectors  bearing assembly. In the vast majority of cases  stage 4 cars are not for road use and are instead track-only cars.Stage 4 in a nutshell:• Stage 3 mods;• Further upgraded turbo/ supercharger;• Dump valve;• Multi-hole injectors;• Usually track-only;• £1 – £3k+ est.~https://hyperchips.co.uk/a-guide-to-tuning-stages/,btohqsg
this guy hybrid turbo and forge or what sia,btohqsg
i think stack stage 4 tune ontop,btohqsg
Drive back home enging piang already,btohqsg
It’s just missing pops and bangs tune,btohqsg
spend so much money on a gti,btohqsg
just go buy a golf r la😂😂😂,btohqsg

why zhng so much when you can just buy a stock golf R😂😂,btohqsg
the stock golf R will smoke the gti bro,btohqsg
u 400whp on a fwd car also damn undriveable😂😂,btohqsg
No because governments still need tax revenue,btohqsg
You will be surprised at the number of brochure buyers in Singapore!!!!,btohqsg
“Yo… my car makes 218hp woorrrrr”,btohqsg
thought auto cars wont rolls back when on D mode. I just got a vw polo 2014 2 weeks ago  so was a bit surprised when it rolled back the slope. Not sure whether it was in auto stop mode  but car was heavy with 4 passengers. I’ve read that some DSG/dual clutch cars may roll back on upslope so checking if anyone experiencing it also,btohqsg
Wah then no incentive to convert o ev  since any savings in fuel will be offset by the road tax,btohqsg
Unless they increase ice road tax to double ev road tax lol,btohqsg
This is why I have a flamethrower in my boot,btohqsg
My car got bombed by this yesterday,btohqsg
The mother like suddenly all the eggs hatch 😵‍💫🤦‍♂️😡 all over the roof of my car sia,btohqsg
Bruh it's about the size of a 5c coin... I don't dare take any closer... I cropped up the photo,btohqsg
Just how much can you save driving an EV?Is going electric really cheaper?Sgcarmart Editorial Team does the science to find out the precise difference between ICE and EV from a dollars and cents perspective.You'll actually be surprised by the conclusion! - JRead the full article herehttp://bit.ly/3EIIXNG,btohqsg
I still think the high road tax is to even out with ice users lol,btohqsg
Once ice 99% scrapped  the road tax would be lower but unlikely to match ice levels,btohqsg
Cos if they dun  then using ev would have substantial savings compared to ice,btohqsg
Road tax is based on emission  for zero emission cars you'd expect 0 road tax but nahhhhh,btohqsg

ev is not 0 emissions tho,btohqsg
Don’t understand how come diesel is more expensive than petrol,btohqsg
hence the high 5k+ road tax for EVs,btohqsg
Yes because more power= more emission,btohqsg
size of battery  contents of battery  alot of many other factors to consider,btohqsg
Diesel engines are more efficient  that's why the FC better than petrol,btohqsg
Diesel used to be at least $1 cheaper den petrol,btohqsg
Now seems like going towards the other direction,btohqsg
diesel prices have gone up worldwide with increase in fuel demand in the shipping industry,btohqsg
Alot of factors to consider when u argue EV is more environmentally friendly. Recycling of battery? or are we just dumping it onto a landfield? Limited resources?,btohqsg
if you are driving an EV  i hope you offset your carbon emission by driving a second car with more than 8 cylinders🤗🤗,btohqsg
production of battery itself causes so much emissions,btohqsg
I shall go back to citing the Volvo study of xc40 recharge vs xc40 ICE emissions,btohqsg
i rmb is they cut diesel production for some reason,btohqsg
i got more data  you want?,btohqsg
ceteris paribus for driving usage and conditions  based on real use emissions of the ICE engine and the production emissions of the EV. You need to drive the EV 160k km to reach net zero emissions compared to the the ICE car,btohqsg
and only then are you producing a lower carbon footprint,btohqsg
The basis of that was just to find an equitable system to tax richer (since they can afford larger cc cars)folks for car ownership,btohqsg
however  the study did not include disposal of battery  changing battery after 8 to 10 years for continuous usage of car and did not include emissions from non renewable sources of electricity,btohqsg
Similar to COE  I reckon they will just revise it to account for ev classifications,btohqsg
When people don't buy new stuffs  manufacturers can't produce new stuffs. When manufacturers can't produce new stuffs  they can't produce emissions.,btohqsg
The effect is so broad that barely any end consumer feels it.,btohqsg
Buying an EV doesn't make anyone become some earth saving nerd. Driving it until it cannot be driven then talk. But wait! Manufacturers now control how long you keep a car - planned obsolescence. You want to drive past 5 years also hard. Waste = emissions too.,btohqsg
Its the same as what manufacturers and consumers too  letting Govs handle it. Never ending cycle.When an EV maker sells the car  their emissions for that car ends  and the ball is now in the customer's court. Whatever emissions next  is the customer's call. When the customer let go the car  its now other people's problem. Most who buy EV don't even drive it until the breakeven numbers. Volvo calculates the XC40 ICE vs Recharge to have a 146 000km breakeven number (using fossil fuels for electricity production).,btohqsg
Quote from outside articles:-There are differences in three items: the emissions in the use phase (by far the largest item in the case of the combustion engine)  the production and supply chain of raw materials and  in the case of the electric cars  battery production. Volvo puts the latter at around 4-5 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle.If you add up the individual items that occur until the car is handed over to the customer  the CO2 emissions of the C40 Recharge (and the all-electric XC40) are around 70 per cent higher than those of the combustion model. The big difference is in the use phase – calculated at 200 000 kilometres.To fully exploit the potential of electric cars  Volvo Cars is therefore calling for more investment in clean energy. “We need green power throughout the supply chain and production  not just in the use phase when charging ” says Otterheim.,btohqsg
Volvo themselves have said that climate neutrality needs the part of everyone. YES. Start by making reliable cars. Start by telling your consumers not to keep changing cars. Walk the damn talk. They want people to spend more money to become greener.,btohqsg
Volvo included in their XC40/C40 Recharge report  that the Li-ion battery is assumed to be taken out of the vehicle and sent to recycling. The metal fractions can be sent for further refining and in the end material recycling. The combustible part of the light fraction can be incinerated for energy  or the entire fraction can end up in landfill. For the purpose of this study  it is assumed the combustible streams of materials are incinerated  while the non-combustible materials are landfilled.Due to the global focus  no energy recovery is included for the incineration steps  even though in some Volvo Cars markets  there is indeed energy recovery from incineration of waste. This somewhat conservative assumption has been made since there are many markets with no energy recovery taking place  and data on how common the case with energy recovery is for the combustible streams is unknown. Assessment of material losses after shredding and in refining are outside the system boundaries set by the cut-off approach.,btohqsg
How about transporting the used batteries? Likely a diesel truck or locomotive. And recyling batteries are extremely expensive too. So much needs to be done still. As of now  its a laugh when people say they buy EV to go green. C'mon. Bluff who? Probably the consumer who believe is being bluffed.,btohqsg
enjoy. Forwarded from one of the volvo gurus,btohqsg
they didn't even account for fossil fuels for electricity production in that study iirc,btohqsg
and general emissions from use of materials,btohqsg
there was a fossil fuel for electricity component but very minute one,btohqsg
This was part of the reason why Tesla itself was struck off the S&P 500,btohqsg

show me the link  of news,btohqsg
it is still a component of spx500,btohqsg

I’m planning to get a second hand car but not sure which car would be reliable for daily usage,btohqsg
What's your budget? Requirements? Brand preference? Age preference?,btohqsg
30k for 1 year  30k for 5 years?,btohqsg
Mainly asking for brand which are good and reliable. I took a look at a Jetta yesterday and did my research before viewing and notice DSG gearbox would have an issue,btohqsg
If you really want something super reliable and don't care for the driving experience,btohqsg
Go with any Toyota that fits the budget and passes a pre purchase inspection for chassis damage and major issues,btohqsg
For hatchbacks  can consider Honda fits,btohqsg
2014-2015 mark should fit your budget,btohqsg
Still parf so you will get the ARF rebate upon scrapping as well (not much for these cars but can help as added budget as you know you'll get it back),btohqsg
the 2009 ones also not bad,btohqsg
A bit too old for the price range for me  leaves you with a long time for the same price,btohqsg
But never know when it'll fall apart,btohqsg
MY 2014-15 throw in and drive for 2 years  don't need to worry about too much as such,btohqsg
But 2009 ones are great if you want it to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum,btohqsg
If you want something more sporty to drive  can consider the swift sport,btohqsg
MY 2010-11 with 5 year COE renewal are available on the market,btohqsg
