i havent try it at kranji yet,btohqsg
I wanna try do donuts somewhere too.,btohqsg
what i really hate about tracks is no run off area,btohqsg
it's as good as a street circuit,btohqsg
Doesnt that depend on which track,btohqsg
So karting arena likes to do this,btohqsg
the RUD in Johor also the same,btohqsg
they put tyres at the sides as barriers with no run offs.,btohqsg
I wanna do with my car,btohqsg
go try and share some gd reviews,btohqsg
But i recommend coming to racetech instead,btohqsg

Anyone know anyone do rim fix,btohqsg
Because got car hit it until very deep in,btohqsg
Just need to know go where and do,btohqsg
If anyone knows how to do it let me know,btohqsg
Any recommendations to do this ?,btohqsg
they will generally know how to fix rims,btohqsg
but the problem is the dent how deep,btohqsg
Or u can try ask Jackie from the tyre terminal,btohqsg
You won't want to compromise on safety,btohqsg
Whole rim need to respray  touch up colour uneven liao lo,btohqsg
Check for hairline cracks have anot,btohqsg
I recommend just change new rim,btohqsg
and they say original rim very strong one?,btohqsg
maybe if that is a replica will be broken already?,btohqsg
those that keep say original damn zai  like macham bulletproof liddat,btohqsg
Apparently is the alloy mixture more zai,btohqsg
Original forged rims dun mean they are impact proofüòÅ,btohqsg
but in this case  the 1 piece liddat = 1 set of replicas liao,btohqsg
no la  volk racing then that price,btohqsg
Rays gram lights not so ex,btohqsg
Depend on rim size I think,btohqsg
should be around 400-600 per piece,btohqsg
