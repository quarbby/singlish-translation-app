"Yes u do...its really important...once sent to armor camp in LCK...Client lost his food due to ""many"" place everywhere....hence proceed to ask RP...they say just place at the table which ever is not occupied. Call up client and also send the picture to him. CS called me up to ask where is the food. I got photo as my prove. Luckily. So loading and the place u offload (e.g hanging on door or placing in the open).",btohqsg
Actually which is the KPI? late pick up bit manage to deliver within delivery window or late deliver to customer? Which one is consider ‚Äúlate‚Äù?,btohqsg
No issue..but when u receive the order  u still have to take a photo to ensure it is placed safely in the box.,btohqsg
