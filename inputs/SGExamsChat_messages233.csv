This is guaranteed to be true because you use 'some',btohqsg
Def not all  bc there are actually depressed and suicidal people who do not have a will to live. Those ppl should be given help,btohqsg
Obviously  in billions of people  there must be some who claim suicidal tendency in bad faith,btohqsg
Nameless cat ofc that doesnt apply to u,btohqsg
Those ppl who live a v perfect life who go ard doing that,btohqsg
The question is  how many people do such things,btohqsg
Q alot but 1 person's has stuck with me until now,btohqsg
She made a whole groupchat cancel me LOL,btohqsg
But do you know what they r actually feeling,btohqsg
Alternative view: whether they seek attention or not  they need attention. The issue is  what kind of attention is given and how are they supported?,btohqsg
Theres no way of seeking prof help without leaving any record,btohqsg
So maybe theyre jyst trying to do so  mayb not prof help,btohqsg

Is it doable(for the gifted yes) to score for A lvl with a duration of less than 2 years? How big is the gap from O lvl papers,btohqsg
Ofc it is. It just depends on how much hardwork and smartwork u put in.,btohqsg
I see thanks! I just making sure I didn't regret choosing poly over over jc :'),btohqsg
So why are u asking abt A's?,btohqsg
I wanna know if A lvl is as hard as many people described. Like I scored well for O lvl not sure if I will do well for A lvl,btohqsg
A levels is def harder than Os and is a different ballgame than Os but it may not be as hard or as bad as some people put it.,btohqsg
Like I said with consistent effort  its not that hard,btohqsg
cannot do well for o levels doesn't mean cannot do well for a levels,btohqsg
I see thank you   this will help me siblungs to decide,btohqsg
can do well for o levels also doesn't mean can do well in poly,btohqsg
Yes  only A and B1 can cut 2 months,btohqsg
But even as A or B1 you need to pass IPPT to cut 2 months,btohqsg
if u bp then nth to say,btohqsg
if u overweight still ok i think,btohqsg
actually nvm idk how they do the pes status,btohqsg
but as long as not bp can liao,btohqsg
as long not bp  got pass ippt,btohqsg
just get rid of water weight before u weigh lol,btohqsg
For Eg  I am in BP and one of my bunkmates has a mass of 70+ kg but is not very tall. And for that reason his BMI is over 27 and is in BP. BUT his IPPT is gold lol.,btohqsg
No need to feel sad for them,btohqsg
And there's still 2y to NS,btohqsg
even though is not a good metric of overall health  but there's a correlation to general health/fitness,btohqsg
How to get into Pes C??,btohqsg
Go to the gym  tear some muscles,btohqsg
get ligament tear :D source my guy friend,btohqsg
Kk time to go play basketball,btohqsg
Need to get a Kevin Durant injury,btohqsg
i help you la  i ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô fall on you when we get rebound,btohqsg
flat foot is pes c rite?,btohqsg
It just measures the relative dimensions of a person,btohqsg
Although people with smaller height/weight ratio tend to be more unfit,btohqsg
I also had another friend in sec sch who was under the overweight catergory just bec of his mass being a little high and its just due to his muscle mass. He is incredibly physically fit but is in that catergory due to the damn BMI.,btohqsg
This is the only anomaly i agree with,btohqsg
Apart from that its one of the current best indicators out there to determine relative fitness,btohqsg
If u want to measure fitness  just ask the person to do a physical fitness test like IPPT. Such tests are the only true indicators of one's physical fitness.,btohqsg
Idt current ippt stations are a good measure of one's fitness,btohqsg
The old ippt stations and grading systems are more accurate,btohqsg
Still IPPT is 100x better at telling how fit a person is than BMI,btohqsg
It gives the general public a rough gauge  albeit some inaccuracies,btohqsg
"Exactly this ""rough gauge"" should not be used alone when determining what kind of training recruits shd get when entering NS",btohqsg
Theres no best indicator  but comparatively imo is better than ippt etc,btohqsg
You say BMI is a better indicator of fitness than IPPT?,btohqsg
At least it gives one a rough indication of how they fare in overall fitness,btohqsg
Ippt u can simply pass by acing ur static stations and barely puttin any effort for running  with the converse being trueAnd even so  3 stations isnt rly sufficient to determine overall fitness,btohqsg
"""Acing ur static stations"" ""simply"" woah... didn't know it was that easy",btohqsg
Yes but those 3 stations are better at determining ur fitness level than the stupid BMI,btohqsg
my gosh go to@memedefto argue about this or smth,btohqsg
If you're really muscular  it'll get counted as fat,btohqsg
Body fat% is a better indicator,btohqsg
so cute! what breed is he/she,btohqsg
My friend did 60 push ups and yoloed his other 2 stationsBarely passed  and now for me and my fren we only need 51 pts minimum to pass,btohqsg
Ur push ups ez 60 right,btohqsg
What happened to the weight training!!,btohqsg
60 push ups but running exceed 15 mins also jialat,btohqsg
Ya bro my fren kinda did that,btohqsg
But yes its easy to ace a particular stationSit up and push ups can be trained easily,btohqsg
Running is 2x the score of other stations,btohqsg
Improve running is the best way,btohqsg
Push ups i guarantee u do 3-5 max reps a day to exhaustion for 4 weeks straight confirm will hit 50-60 by end of month if u put in efforf,btohqsg
I'd like to remind u we're only humans not gods,btohqsg
My IPPT score is mainly from run,btohqsg
U shld try it when u have free time,btohqsg
how many pushups do u even need?,btohqsg
Extra 3 months is - uh no,btohqsg
The passing mark for IPPT for recruits is 61 points,btohqsg
That is u need a total of 61 points from all 3 stations,btohqsg
Max for sit-ups and push-ups is 25pt each,btohqsg
To pass IPPT  u need to attain a total of 61pts and at least 2pts in each station. For age below 22  u need to do 16 push ups/sit ups to get 2pts for each station.,btohqsg
i heard if u pass the ns period will be reduced,btohqsg
Yes  but only if u PES A/B1,btohqsg
when do poly students take ippt eveb?,btohqsg
U have to book an IPPT slot yourself  before u enlist,btohqsg
ohh  if we are going to cyberns/airforce do we still need go?,btohqsg
You take it  unless your PES doesn't allow it,btohqsg
U can't escape from IPPT if u are physically able to do it....,btohqsg
is 3 yrs enough to become fit?,btohqsg
"What do u mean by ""vv unfit""",btohqsg
How is that vv unfit lol,btohqsg
no lah but height doesnt match up,btohqsg
theres smppl online that can go from obese to fit,btohqsg
no lah shdnt be dat bad,btohqsg
Well at least ur not in BP,btohqsg
@junghon3709can cfm? I rmb is can leh,btohqsg
Are you gonna summon all the NSmen,btohqsg
Theres google for a reason right,btohqsg
Gold - $300Silver - $200for NSF,btohqsg
no kick for you la  if you don't get commando gold I'll be surprised,btohqsg
your 2.4 alr 50 points liao,btohqsg
I rmb he say before he run 7+ one,btohqsg
what is this an ns chat group,btohqsg
got people sprint in sec4 2.4 they take 8-9,btohqsg
i mean flying work as well,btohqsg
For those who got such timings  that's prob their highest running speed,btohqsg
2.4 in under 8 minutes for a relatively healthy 19 year old guy that does proper training for a couple of months,btohqsg
Is very possible from my experience,btohqsg
anybody has ehistory and ss notes for olevels?,btohqsg

not sure but just send ill see if it is,btohqsg

Y‚Äôall got see this year O level timetable? One day they only sit for one subject. Ours is one day sit for at least 2 subjects,btohqsg

LaSalle and NAFA are becoming a university,btohqsg
University of the Arts in Singapore,btohqsg
Yea saw it on mothership news,btohqsg
Singapore will set up its first arts university - an alliance between Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and LASALLE College of the Arts.https://cna.asia/3bc9RyB,btohqsg
I think they‚Äôre attempting to squeeze as much as possible out of the segment of the population inside the arts schools,btohqsg
Rather than simple consigning them to be failures,btohqsg
Or maybe they're running out of students,btohqsg
And this is effectively a merger,btohqsg
They wouldn‚Äôt go to the extent of giving it a degree program if it was a simple merger,btohqsg
Iirc he is some guy in NS uh,btohqsg

hi! Does anyone know if stalford learning centre is a good place to get tuition? (H2 chem),btohqsg

Enough talk about polandballIt is time to talk about austriacock,btohqsg
you wanna see a comic about mental health HAHAHAH,btohqsg
that sure went from 0 - 100 real quick,btohqsg
at least there's greater mental health awareness in korea,btohqsg
thats a top tier Polandball comic,btohqsg
So isn't this group  you are asking a lot,btohqsg
u are doin this for tuition purposes?,btohqsg
i may need to tutor my juniors who are studying for their a levels this year and next year,btohqsg
then u shld ownself find it,btohqsg
idt is right for a tutor to ask from others for resources anyways,btohqsg
after all this grp is supposed to help students mainly,btohqsg
and they dont release for publication,btohqsg
if we dont have the h3 physics 2020 paper and h3 math 2019 and 2020 papers its fine,btohqsg
anyway i think most teachers teaching these 2 subjects do not wish to allow so-called illegal circulation of h3 papers just to help students in their h2 level,btohqsg
u dont rly need h3 stuff to help u in h2 anyway,btohqsg
perhaps we can use h3 stuff and modify them so that they are adapted to those taking h2?,btohqsg
u can  and since we are on that  why not use higher lvl material you have (I assume u are a uni student) and modify it for h3 content to use?,btohqsg
after all y1 uni stuff essentially overlaps with h3 content,btohqsg
so thats ur only way now,btohqsg
if you guys have practiced all the past papers on your own and what not  will you go to different boards the cambridge has and practice their past papers?,btohqsg
Not local exams  i am talking about the Cambridge exams like GCSE IGCSE CAIE,btohqsg
Idk what sort of board is there in Singapore but here in Pakistan our international board is CAIE,btohqsg
no point tho  syllabus likely diff,btohqsg
Diff extent of the topics are tested,btohqsg
Understood  .... Can you share me the syllabus tho,btohqsg
U can just search for it tho :)Google  your friend here,btohqsg
I could have googled it but i wasnt sure about the board and code ... we share the same board but different code ... aur math code is 9709 your is 9758,btohqsg
Just do your own past year paper  it's sufficient,btohqsg
oh no no no  i was not asking for myself  i am actually asking all this for you guys,btohqsg
i made this tool in frustration and so i thought maybe others can benefit too  by others i mean students outside the code of 9709,btohqsg
i mean it's math i think it will work no matter the syllabus lol,btohqsg

hi does anyone have 2020 H1 china studies in English A level paper because im taking A levels this year and my teacher doesnt even have the paper,btohqsg
Prior approval from John  just wanted to share about this Organisation that is looking for volunteer tutors...,btohqsg
can someone advise me on the difference between pure and combined subjects for O levels  assuming there's no restriction in taking any subject (cos private candidate).in terms of difficulty and also applying to poly (jc not a concern),btohqsg
Combined science is about 70% of pure science,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs really a small thing,btohqsg
The main thing is that combined science exams are much much easier than pure science exams,btohqsg
Eg combined Chem is 70% of pure Chem,btohqsg
Combined humans (the non SS part) is half of its pure counterpart,btohqsg
Eg combined lit would have 1 lit paper,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know if either is generally harder though,btohqsg
i took core history back in 2015.,btohqsg
2 papers for Pure  1 paper for combined,btohqsg
if combined 2 textbooks  pure would be 4,btohqsg
but do keep in mind that this happened 6 yrs ago so it may be outdated,btohqsg
Well for sci  pure sci u learnt abit more than comb sci but I think one difference that can be seen is in the practicals as for the practicals for comb is abit easier ig cuz for chem u jus mix  heat and test for gases in the testtubes but for pure i think need use burette and other sci equipment ig,btohqsg
im aware this is not the right platform to send links like this,btohqsg

I like doing things by myself,btohqsg
Its okay to do things alone,btohqsg
i mean u wanna spend time with people to talk or sth haha,btohqsg
Well i do want to spend time with my friends but sometimes you need time for yourself,btohqsg
And I dont really have a lot of friends so I'm comfortable with doing things alone,btohqsg
I guess its our own personal choices and preferences. Not everyone likes doing things alone like myself,btohqsg
If it makes you feel better going out with friends why not? :),btohqsg
I know but it's just that i spend a lot of my time with my grandparents alone like almost every single day and it's a bit hard to convo with them when they dont really wanna talk,btohqsg
Im sure you have some friends who like cats :)),btohqsg
and ya i do have friends it's just that i dont see them that often,btohqsg
Its okay. Im kinda jealous you get to spend time with your grandparents. I didn't have the chance at all as they passed away before I was born,btohqsg

nope he still wants to sleep all day,btohqsg
I guess he probably has this mindset that since he's old he shld not waste so much of his energy,btohqsg
But its actually the opposite. Young or old we still need to do some form of physical activity,btohqsg
