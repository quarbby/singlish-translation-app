new driver here  when are usually the surge periods?,btohqsg
Based on my few mths experience  usually 10.30-12.30pm and 5-7pm,btohqsg
But recently not many orders and v low rate,btohqsg
Won't have much jobs 1. No difference,btohqsg
Yeah fri to sun good time to do,btohqsg
Economy open up liao. More pple go out. So of cos super less jobs. So price is low. N so many more drivers come do. So llm not worth it liao.,btohqsg

This mth sch holiday all go overseas,btohqsg
But lalamove still give the best rates compared to other platforms like pickupp?,btohqsg
I feel pickupp more heng suay‚Ä¶ their rates can be super high or super low,btohqsg
Good rate no use. So little job,btohqsg
N only base price better rate. But longer distance,btohqsg
Covid time can make alot  no pple come join. Now jobs lesser n less surge price n +$  then see more n more pple come join. All kena bluff by llm marketing. Say can make 2k/wküòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

I joined bcos they say will give some $75 fuel rebate to newcomers  I dun see it anywhere now and dunno how to claim,btohqsg
Hahaha‚Ä¶ srsly dunno whr they get the confidence to put up such figures‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Lol  gg on for awhile liao lorüòÇ,btohqsg
At first I already swipe the job  gg to end the timing sekali got someone swipe then i never get,btohqsg

I just stay at hm. Save my petrol n time n energy. N won't get frustrated,btohqsg
Drive also can fall down. Many many yrs ago I drive car  left side went into drain. Must call tow trucküòÇ,btohqsg
Was at that small small lane opp Holland Village. The lane to the open air carpark. Trying to siam a boy running across then kena the drain. End up block off the whole laneüòÇ,btohqsg
Killiney Rdside Carpark lots if u can get,btohqsg
Anyway if got cheap parking in orchard  chances r u have to be lucky to get a lot at this time,btohqsg
Better go see doc or tcm,btohqsg
If don't treat properly  nxt time alot of problem 1,btohqsg
Anyone know wad is the shopping cart logo on the job order means?,btohqsg
Means personal shopper . The customer wants you to help to buy a certain items. Upon acceptance of job  call the customer to request for payment of the items to be purchased via Paynow or bank transfer you u. Without payment don‚Äôt buy.,btohqsg
those with bike... can try and let us know.,btohqsg
how's everyone. I 2 weeks never do llm liao. lol,btohqsg

waaa everyone earning big bucks. üòÇ,btohqsg

cannot sign up online  onboarding is in person. Earliest date 30 June.,btohqsg
Think he coming from the food platform mentality where jobs are assigned. It happens quite a lot there  deliver to ulu place then no job.,btohqsg
Why pickup hero the price all so LowüòÇ,btohqsg
That's why nobody do. Can't cover patrol also,btohqsg
Basically dun come woodland   yishun n sembawang. This 3 places horrible. Once out many driver there to snatch. Sure lose de. I stay here I know. So choose your delivery area carefully,btohqsg
Depends bro. Sometimes we also cannot expect to wait and wait at same location. If at woodlands  got job at admiralty or sembawang lan2 bid only  better got something then got nothing.Somemore now is Durian period  a few vendors that I took from are asking if want to do for them perm for 3-4 weeks.,btohqsg
System siao again... I m in Woodlands but map show go Malaysia pump petrol üò≠üòÇ,btohqsg
This I agree.. I stay woodlands so competition is very fierce n sometimes  no stickers no priority... I blink my eyes only  the job taken,btohqsg

Hiii just curious what do you all think about the lalamove platform and etcü§î,btohqsg
Also is it common to get like suspension/ban even after appealing?ü§î,btohqsg
As in like the agents and like how they deal with difficulties and weird situations thoughü§îüòÇ I think the app itself it not bad also but the $ can be betterü§™,btohqsg
I started not long so I wanted to know more,btohqsg
Llm price is 1 of the highest for delivery platform liao. If u find it not good enough then think u shldnt do,btohqsg
He's just being honest. To me it's better than sugar coating our answers. Delivery is not an easy or comfy job. If u can't take straightforward honest reply  then isn't it the same as u can don't read or reply to his answers,btohqsg
Like I said nowdays answers must be sugar coated 1,btohqsg
Tdy so weird. Managed to get the +8 n now another +4,btohqsg

Bcoz every job must wait for llm cs to edit for you,btohqsg
Just chat with cs  solve alr.. gg,btohqsg
Saw that order a few times this weeküòÇ,btohqsg
financial literacy is not for everyone...,btohqsg
Don't know what to say liao. So easy to believe easy money,btohqsg
Hoe to inform Cs  can't swipe?,btohqsg
Stupid app  ask me go back again???,btohqsg
just tell them u collect n now on the way to delivered. ask them overwrite n u can take photo to upload,btohqsg

No lah bro  I‚Äôm not Gary,btohqsg
Cannot reveal too much  but it is possible to clock $3.5 to 4K as a walker,btohqsg
How? I dunno. I car also cannot,btohqsg
I really want to know if have other way. I know yes if just take any job can make higher gross,btohqsg
But after costs nett is not high,btohqsg
End for non hybrid may have to pump petrol every 2 days  costs is high wor,btohqsg
Now full tank after discount also need 100+ liao,btohqsg
Then switch to walker more worth sia,btohqsg
No need cp  petrol  Rd tax etc,btohqsg
I not trying to kajiao hor  I really intd to know if possibleüòä,btohqsg
Actually for certain places mrt might b faster,btohqsg

They prob will try not to give u,btohqsg
sorry 1 thing i also dun do all those tiong outlet. Try once already enough is enough,btohqsg
learn from mistake  like now i will never never take YUM CHA Chinatown,btohqsg
Serious ah bro walker can score that much 12 order can reach 190 cun boh...,btohqsg
I think quite often it's the delivery platform n not the resto,btohqsg
I ever otw to tiong outlet  the platform is delivery Chinatown. They call me told me my job cancelled cos another rider went to take liao. Double order. They called me 1 2 mins after I took the job. First time got platform call me tell me fast fastüòÇüëç,btohqsg
I've seen Getz platform throw out same job 2 diff order bike n car. Sometimes when the expensive order taken  the other order(be it bike or car) which is cheaper doesn't disappear. It stays there for quite awhile. That can be a red flag that platform may be waiting for some1 take the cheaper job,btohqsg
I kena b4 Getz order once. After that I don't take their jobs,btohqsg
Yea i have noticed before. I think even oddle has had such situations,btohqsg
Oddle mostly still stick to either bike or car,btohqsg
Correct oddle is the most stable in that sense typically,btohqsg
Getz will almost 70-80% have both,btohqsg
One thing bout getz also. If restaurant or merchant asks for order number usually we cant refer,btohqsg
Although on their side they have the receipt w the number,btohqsg
N Getz is more stingy. They tend not to give high demand surcharge or +$,btohqsg
Even when the original pick up time has passed by,btohqsg
So quite a few of their jobs always late for dropüòÇ,btohqsg
Based off observations. The most likely ones would be deliverychinatown/startaster followed by oddle,btohqsg
Partly cos DC startaster mostly pick up now,btohqsg
It's always good to study all these small things,btohqsg
So that u know what to avoid  less surprises  etc,btohqsg
pick up one order just now  waited for 1 hr....,btohqsg
Luckily was my last job n decided I will rest... Didn't expect to wait 1 hr,btohqsg
Got claim waiting fee or nor,btohqsg
I this time learn le .  Text CS  screen shot  call customer  WhatApp customer again.. all got evidence,btohqsg
Customer actually told me from system said I already pick up food n delivery show I reach 1250pm...I told him  no I m still at restaurant n I reconfirm with manager that no one pick up the order etc.Take photo WhatApp customer that I m still there...What makes my day is . Customer very nice to me... Polite n he give me TIPS!!,btohqsg
$11...can go la 9 cups of kopi ..üòú,btohqsg
My last job  food supposed to reach 1pm. I only bid n get the job at 1250pm. But the recipient nvr give me tips üò¢,btohqsg
All he did was give me a thumbs up when I reach his condoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Nevermind.. I got $11... I buy u kopi.. at woodlands now . Later I Canberra...,btohqsg
Eh nvm  u drink better  too far for me,btohqsg
Today I saw so many town job +$4  to woodlands side,btohqsg
I saw these 2.. I was 7km away I dare not take ..too stress...Oh wait u n me so nearby!! We are 4km away,btohqsg
Y u don't take  very good price the marsiling 1,btohqsg
U take that job itself almost $40,btohqsg
1 wk ago tdy alot of jobs came out liao. There n then don't take advance jobs  tdy whole day will super alot of high priceüòÇ,btohqsg
But then  that's my pattern lah. Some prefer to cfm have the jobs 1st. Different style,btohqsg
The thing abt stacking like this is  if any resto cok up that day  or traffic or what  danger of kena late lor,btohqsg
Which I really don't like having to deal with love letterüòÇ,btohqsg
Stack immediate have more leeway  but of course with better price n leeway  comes the disadvantage that u might not have the jobs available for stack or to do.,btohqsg
So it's pros n cons  give n take. See which u choose,btohqsg
All I know is  only on special occasions have so many jobs etc  so if don't take advantage of the high surge etc  it's very wasted,btohqsg
I scare . Saw lucky plaza park n I was still waiting for the restaurant,btohqsg
My blood pressure will also go high...,btohqsg
U don't get this on normal sunday,btohqsg
Yea food orders can raise $50,btohqsg
That's y special occasion days no need take advance,btohqsg
Fathers day mothers day cny Xmas always bomz,btohqsg
Sadly I stuck with the 7 orders,btohqsg
The api for claiming late fee need to dp anyrhing? First time claimimg,btohqsg
Hi guys need help. What's nice to eat in suntecüòÇ,btohqsg
Walker doesn't means necessary just walk right? Can be using public transport?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know la. I‚Äôm not a walker. Just kidding. But walker still need to meet the timing so they won‚Äôt give far away jobs.,btohqsg
Even if use public cant meet the timing unless not too far away,btohqsg
Wah  u from marsiling cheong back to sultan gate ahüò±,btohqsg
No lah. Stack is the way to go. Suntec sultan gate  telok blangah then marsiling,btohqsg
Sultan gate was scheduled order so i pick up earlier ard 8,btohqsg
Then chiong. End up marsiling late by 6mins. Lol,btohqsg
Yaa. Haha. Really chiong coz Delivery Chinatown keep calling. Haha.,btohqsg
Pickup suntec at 745. Sultan gate 8pm. Reach telok b at 825. Chiong to marsiling 851pm,btohqsg
I ride bike mah. So can cut some time by slipping in and out,btohqsg
Huh? How am i late. 745 to 851 pm isnt it 6 mins past the 1 hr allowance,btohqsg
If tired need rest or family commitments bor bian 1 lah,btohqsg
Anyway  just remember  4 occasions to work. Parents day cny xmas,btohqsg

Deliver one time to there  then ban mbs job liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Place too big  dunno park at which section. Park liao walk until siao cos park too far away,btohqsg
The place too big. Take too much time to find üòÇ,btohqsg
720 order. But nobody take. Thats why tip is 14 dollars. By the time i swipe is already 725. So i pickup is 745 alr. Zzzz. Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm explaining myself,btohqsg
And I‚Äôve been taking DC orders long enough so don‚Äôt worry bout me. Rating is still 4.98 and excellent,btohqsg
Relax la. Just for sharing only mah. üòÖ,btohqsg
Lol. No la i wan go home already i stay north. And i need 2 more orders to complete mission and i see the telok blangah one is the most reasonable. Usually i only stack to same location or nearby,btohqsg
I was thinkg u stay north. Otherwise won't do such a stack. Try not to do like that even if u want complete mission. U had to drive fast n furious I guess  not worth it if kena anytg. Good that u completed safe n sound lah,btohqsg
Remember  own life more impt than the few dollars llm give us,btohqsg
Yaa true. Think back the telok blangah one is really out of the way. Hahah. End up have to rush like mad. Just now on the road cant think properly just swipe,btohqsg
That's the 1 thing abt the mission incentives,btohqsg
Alot of pple keep wanting to complete it. Psychological,btohqsg
Then may just do any job to get the incentives,btohqsg
Which actually after u count it is not much $/job,btohqsg
Of course u still do as much jobs as u can but don't push it just to hit the incentive,btohqsg
But again this is my own thinking lahüòÇ,btohqsg
Sometimes I look at the missions  I just get the feeling llm just wants to seduce drivers to do any job regardless of price etc so as to show their customers that our platform is good. Any job also have drivers fast fast take  so that clients will keep using llm,btohqsg
Especially on wkends I think there r more part timers doing  so when they accept mission they will just take any job that comes. Again all this is my own thoughts  apologies if offend anyone or is incorrect.,btohqsg
Bor lui  bor looks  bor figure. So can only have single lifeüòÇ,btohqsg
See this weather sleep at hm goodüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Say only the rain at my area stop üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi all  anybody here got dispute on paintwork after removing the stickers from vehicle,btohqsg
Later I will share my incident pertaining to this matter. My intention is to share my encounters so we can be more alert n know what to take note of,btohqsg
Pls do  am interested to know more. Thank you,btohqsg
What is going on? What is kick m save?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the how late can the restaurant take before we can claim through live chat? Eg pickup scheduled order at 4.30pm,btohqsg
So if speak to CS = valid cancellation = no penalty,btohqsg
the word valid is not defined by us  is LLM. Cos someone here says b4  even his car breaks down the next day he also got a suspension. SO valid or not. who knows. confirm we dun know. All this platform full of driver  less 1 no difference to them,btohqsg
Sounds like we are inside Squid Game ah‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg
This afternoon I went to remove the lalamove stickers from my honda fitDrove and parked at the shopfront at ubi techpark  went inside to inform that I want go remove the stickers and was assisted while ask to take a seat while someone will be here to assist to remove the stickers. I was taking a seat at the lobby facing the front desk.Within minutes  a male staff walk out of the office and went to my car to remove the stickers immediately without informing me at all. I was lucky that I just happen to turn my head to look at my car and saw first piece of the lalamove sticker is removed accordingly,btohqsg
I went towards him and watch him continuously removing the lalamove stickers. The left side of the car door at the front  paintwork fell off and he immediately signalled me of the damage as I was watching closely.Next  was the left door at the back. He blocked my view and just remove the stickers  however I notice the paint work fell off too and told him that to which he nodded and inform he will take pictures of the damage and tell me to drive to the designated car workshop nearby and they will arrange to get it fix,btohqsg
Any1 can anyhow just remove the stickers 1 ah? No need go workshop to remove 1 meh? Sorry hor cos I dunno all these things 1,btohqsg
Lalamove sent me msg and ask me to proceed to the car workshop given in the WhatsApp and so I did,btohqsg
Ask me to look for a lady called siew mui who is the lady boss of the car workshop.,btohqsg
These are the after removal look from lalamove. They only mention to fix the damage paintwork but never say the adhensive part u guys saw they will take care of it as well,btohqsg
The adhesive part is the line?,btohqsg
Lalamove staff is trained workshop pple mehüòÇüò±ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I parked outside their office and they remove the stickers on the spot,btohqsg
This is why I keep procrastinating over whether to put sticker. And mine new car 1 yr odd old only,btohqsg
Think they don't give a damn abt our cars,btohqsg
The workshop quoted $240 for the repair of paint work. The same lalamove staff who removed the stickers called me and said I signed the contract during the installation of the stickers and in the clause it stated that the maximum damage amount they are willing to compensate is $207,btohqsg
The rest of the outstanding I have to pay myself,btohqsg
It's ok bro. But thanks for the offer. Appreciate itüôè,btohqsg
Luckily my car is a coe car  remaining 1 year plus to scrap so i didnt proceed with the repair,btohqsg
Earlier  the workshop lady boss called lalamove to confirm the damage cost to be bill to them. They didn't pick up. I called them and they send me msg,btohqsg
The purpose of me sharing is based on my personal experience with lalamove and I hope my sharing can help people to take reference and consider more before installation and during removal of the stickers,btohqsg
Ok bro.  Thanks for the advice. Anyway I'm going to stick other company sticker soon. Till then I will remember your tipsüòäüëçüôè,btohqsg
I make sure I stand there watch them do,btohqsg
Dun care they uncomfortable or not,btohqsg
Thanks alot for sharing. Helped me make my decision of not sticking the sticker concreteüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The workshop maybe is owned by llm üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Dun think so  as the lady boss told me there were 3 vehicles before who came to her workshop and none were confirm job for her to do and she thought mine is her first deal. Sadly no alsoüòÇ,btohqsg
Think she will have difficulty getting the payment from llm alsoüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe need to wait for every Wed then can get the paymentüòÇ,btohqsg
Dun think even got business from llm.. who will pay for the damage? üòÇ. They stick their advertisement on your car and when removed and caused damages to the paintwork  you still need to top up extra if too expensive. Wtf. lol.,btohqsg
Btw Ive withdraw all the credits from llm today,btohqsg
Llm like to push responsibilities away,btohqsg
All the best for ur nxt endeavour üôèüëç,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I wonder why so many cars these days have full body decals. When come to remove  good luck to the paint below‚Ä¶ because adhesive tapes baked on with solar power for days‚Ä¶ no joke to remove.,btohqsg
Chat live chat 1 sec they press dk what then i can swipe arrive alrd,btohqsg
