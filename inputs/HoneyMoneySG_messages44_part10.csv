must I be an employee? cos rn I'm jus a student haha so I'm jus parking my money somewhere,btohqsg
you just answered some generic questions? or did you have to validate via singpass or what,btohqsg
u mean i wont be eligible for EGA if i alrd hv a hsbc cc?,btohqsg
I validated via singpass then answered some generic questions too like whether I'm SGrean which I am etc,btohqsg
then i dunno already... sounds like they have some reason to decline you as a customer..maybe your name is similar to some watch list persons  or you are linked to some watch list.,btohqsg
wah gg lmao I jus have a unique Chinese name tho ü•≤shud I go down to HSBC bank to create an acc if I still can't create one online?,btohqsg
wow the HSBC branches are so far away HAHA,btohqsg
if I don't want to go through so much hassle  what other accounts would y'all recommend to just park $40k for eg,btohqsg
Anyone still hasn't gotten their Revolut March public transport cashback?,btohqsg
If by now u didn‚Äôt get means something wrong. Likely u used master which groups the spend and u didn‚Äôt clock the required day count,btohqsg
u will be. but can't apply online,btohqsg
hope your name isn't Xi Jinping,btohqsg
I have my reasons not to deal with HSBC. It‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs the bank of opium war that brings shame for my race for more than a century (although they are)  it‚Äôs simply HSBC are too much of a hassle. More so when they closed many many branches.,btohqsg
That was then and that‚Äôs why HSBC is one of the Big Four banks in UK  and some say the world.History lesson aside HSBC TnCs are longer than my grandmas favorite Taiwanese drama serials,btohqsg
i just feel the t&c is quite chim  not as straightfwd as uob one or ocbc 360..,btohqsg
now HSBC not even in top 20... JP Morgan is growing as it swallows more US Regional Banks. ,btohqsg
What do ya mean  the Revolut card is a mastercard so it will auto grp the transactions  how to help it?,btohqsg
use Revolut virtual Visa next time.,btohqsg
"MasterCard posts public transports when u have clocked 10 transactions as a single ""charge"" on the card. (Revolut wont know the ten trips)VISA posts public transport transactions daily.Hope this clears the air",btohqsg
So I basically used the Revolut Mastercard for transport the whole mnth of March for 0% cashback and now I got money stuck inside cause topped up by cc which I cannot withdraw? Cri,btohqsg
anyone got any suggestions regarding this? üòÖüòÅ,btohqsg
Can speak to their customer service that you have used it for over ten days. I've seen cases where the Revolut CSO asks for proof of it by asking for screenshots in TL SimplyGo apps.,btohqsg
Walao Barclays not even on top 20?Remember Visa is the payment system spin-off of Barclays of England + Bank of America  California . Both world class banksBefore Chase swallow the regional banks  Bank of America is THE bank in America. They financed Disney  set up Visa and literally built out Silicon Valley AND Los Angeles with their loans.,btohqsg
Any gurus know for EGA if you hit the criteria for bonus interest will there be notification? Because I did 5 $1 Axs transactions then it was reversed back to me few days later...,btohqsg
I opened HSBC EGA yesterday but no email or notification that it has went through  any idea if this is normal?,btohqsg
https://hmsg.link/oneaccountNot sure if still relevant link though,btohqsg
erratic.. sometimes you get SMS sometimes no...,btohqsg
takes a few days to reflect the notif  i personally transfer out to my other accounts $1 cause those i doubt will ever bounce üòÇ,btohqsg
I better do that now to lock in for may,btohqsg
yes as long as satisfied within the month it is ok already... no need 1st day of the month... hahado 5 x $10 FAST out is easier la,btohqsg
oh?! I always thought need do on first day else will lose on that first few days haha,btohqsg
actually (from what I know  but i'm kiasu)  if you sms in May 2023  you are qualified for May and June 2023. The SMS says until end of NEXT MONTH.BUT  I always do in the first week of every month because i'm kiasu.,btohqsg
Remember to top up at least $2k  else all effort wasted üòÖ extra 1% interest on top up amount only,btohqsg
Whats the best way to contact? I using the in-app Live Chat the agent not responding lol,btohqsg
2k is fresh funds or can transfer out from EGA and back in?,btohqsg
Sadly that's the only option  but ok la i think u just state ur case and whatever u have at one go should be pretty fine,btohqsg
Can just the same in and out,btohqsg
Nop CSO didnt accept it dam useless,btohqsg
why AXS transaction? Should do FAST transfer out from EGA,btohqsg
hm FAST easier  get processed immediately and definitely eligible,btohqsg

Not sure have you read the HSBC term and condition. If you have not  you may want to read it first. After reading it  you will become The Guru.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-governing-everydayrewards-programme.pdf,btohqsg
