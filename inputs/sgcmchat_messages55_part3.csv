U can drive both manual and auto,btohqsg
then again theres more auto cars mow,btohqsg
I mean  from my perspective  the manual cars are more affordable also ah. Cos older  and I wanna drive manual next time.,btohqsg
and manual cars are much more expensive now,btohqsg
U talking abt now  or old cars ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I mean  depends on the make Ah,btohqsg
I mean to each of their own ah,btohqsg
Depends on wat type of car,btohqsg
i mean for what ive seen for honda civic and the evo,btohqsg
To some is affordable to some more ex so this thing cnnt debate lor,btohqsg
my fam car is a hyundai but idk the price of it,btohqsg
From what I know auto is more ex,btohqsg
I think cos of the technology?,btohqsg
u talking about manual or auto,btohqsg
Not really  especially if you go school,btohqsg
Auto slots much harder to find,btohqsg
Manual you may take a longer time and more classes,btohqsg
But auto you take roughly the same time for less classes because of availability,btohqsg
Just that no one brings in basic manuals anymore,btohqsg
You can still find cheap manuals via PI or on the used market as well,btohqsg
Just don't look at the usual subies or civics,btohqsg
The pricing for those has been blown out of proportion already,btohqsg
Is auto more ex because of the technology?,btohqsg
They will soon start coming down or stabilize because of dealers working together,btohqsg
If you look at global markets,btohqsg
Because an auto gearbox is more expensive to make/buy,btohqsg
