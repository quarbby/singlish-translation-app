and they like prompt me once,btohqsg
bruh i think i never gotten <3 prompts in my whole entire oral life b4,btohqsg
what bedok said about luck is basically me,btohqsg
so shld i go 100% on chi,btohqsg
luck was what sent me to poly,btohqsg
you said you need to pass all subs right? what subs you failing now?,btohqsg
shld i remember as much words as i can for chinese for vocab read chinese articles speak chinese regularly,btohqsg
to improve chi..i just binge watch chinese mediacorp shows,btohqsg
write more essays emails do more papers,btohqsg
i watch chinese romance show ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
although like 20% idk but yes,btohqsg
issit possible to improve chinese speaking in 1-2 weeks LOL idts,btohqsg
"bruh after prelim my chi teacher..told me infront of the whole class ""im afraid you will be the only one that cant pass""",btohqsg
actually nvm not for national exams,btohqsg
my oral prelim my teacher gave the passage beforehand the day before,btohqsg
and asked us memorise the words,btohqsg
but not counted tho she asked us memorise,btohqsg
so we recognise when we read,btohqsg
i had one friend that did that...,btohqsg
the theme was sports..he talked into health,btohqsg
and plus i got coursework and remediation,btohqsg
as for now knowing i feel like i cant go pfp,btohqsg
I have tuition but i want to give up,btohqsg
Idk my tutor doesnt really help me much,btohqsg
She just writes better answers for me but i dont learn,btohqsg
so you average getting like lvl2 on qns ah,btohqsg
And she always kinda saying oh i always write one page for this,btohqsg
I got like 2/20 for history,btohqsg
And she always say she wld study 12 hours and can finish syllabus in 8 hrs,btohqsg
I never finish and i throw context knowledge in eval in base source,btohqsg
my time it was part a to e,btohqsg
i never once finished my humans paper once,btohqsg
If you had AQF..could have gotten at least 2 marks each qns,btohqsg
Cant change tutor now too late,btohqsg
I can ask her replace humans with chinese,btohqsg
She teaches me 3 subjs also,btohqsg
I was like planning if cannot finish one qn ill just finish up the paragraph and move on,btohqsg
the marks you told me  basically means you missed out on the humanities template,btohqsg
You likely missed out on AQF or (Answer Question First),btohqsg
I feel like im neglecting my other subjects cause i like math and prefer math so i just think ill take abreak from math,btohqsg
No..first off you need to be concise and clear what direction you want to aim,btohqsg
you said sec 5  but after sec 5...where do you want to go,btohqsg
because from the marks you are getting...im fairly confident you can get 19pts not problem,btohqsg
ok  if you got time lookup the entrance requirement for the course you want,btohqsg
it is just chi or humans thatll bring me badly,btohqsg
is cut off pt at 5-13,btohqsg
no she is not even hitting 5 marks for humans,btohqsg
but my future depends on eae,btohqsg
