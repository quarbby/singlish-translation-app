Hey I am kinda lost with crypto stablecoin like USDC  USDT  etcâ€¦,btohqsg
I wonder how do crypto gurus here choose which stablecoins to investment letâ€™s say to earn interest by staking the stablecoins?,btohqsg
USDC USDT UST BUSD are all stablecoins that serves the same purpose  = 1 USD.Just that they are built by different founders.Like your singtel starhub M1 all samesame but different.I am no guru but I like to choose what I think is the safest with high APY and that's UST.If you stake on hodlnaut its 13%. If you stake natively its 19% APY.,btohqsg
Ok can. I also only have the mindset of which one is the highest APY,btohqsg
Will explore a few platform and start my budget allocation for stablecoins staking,btohqsg
"To me  getting profit very easy one. Just buy and hodl only mah.The focus is how not to lose money hehe.You bet on a wrong asset... ggYou panic sell... ggYou bet too much on a single buy and crash... ggat the end of the day  i always ask ""how these people earn money to give us 19% sia""then i will know what to do legood luck ah",btohqsg
Agree. Thatâ€™s why I just wanted to find out  beside USBC USDT for example  since it is all similar equal to USD. I wonder whatâ€™s the difference between the two. And the one I checked in Celsius  it seems both USDC and USDT interest P.A. same same~,btohqsg
I will check on the hodlnaut.,btohqsg
Recently comparing  Celsius   Nexo  and Hadlnaut from seedly post.,btohqsg
Usdc shld be more safe. There is some controversy saga on tether.,btohqsg
I read that in seedly also,btohqsg
Currently have some in crypto app  last time 12% for 3 months in earn for those with Purple/Green tier,btohqsg
"USDT is laojiao. They don't want let people audit them  so people deem it as shady. But being the laojiao then they got the first mover advantage lo. thats why you see so many people using.USDC is audited and proven to be good liao.All these are pegged to 1USD and backed by $. So naturally the APY they gave are market rate. same same one.If you wanna play DEFI one its like DAI or UST which is way higher. Cuz the founder ownself promise higher APY with their fancy protocol. All not sustainable one. But I don't really care haha  free money I just take. ""Not sustainable"" means they can't give high APY forever one. they eventually will drop to market rate. which is the same as USDC and USDT",btohqsg
Until recently announced 8% in crypto earn,btohqsg
Ok  thanks for this info. I will see how much I willing to put and still able to sleep at night,btohqsg

No. The limit is way less than u think. If have more than 6 transaction per day  sometime the card get locked. They say for security reason. Crap...,btohqsg
I see. What do you spend for 6 transactions a day?,btohqsg
Did not spend much. But somehow it fail to transact after 6 spends,btohqsg

Anyone knows whatâ€™s the best card for overseas usage to accumulate points/miles?,btohqsg
For your information  I finally figured out how to connect bank accounts to Revolut. This is what I got from customer service:---Thanks for your patience  Upon checking and further review  seems like you need to set up first a Designated external account.From the app  tap Payments  scroll down to Bank accounts and Add recipient.Under the Individual tab  you will be prompted to enter details of your bank account  your name  and address. Please ensure that the name you input exactly matches with your account registered name with Revolut (you can check your Revolut account registered name in-app  under profile  settings).After you have set up your newly created recipient  you will be able to set it as your External Account using the toggle.,btohqsg
