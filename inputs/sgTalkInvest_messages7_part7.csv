I’m not knowledgeable in property business but I’m knowledge in google  is that alright?U can check your own property title for free via singpass then you can see for yourselfhttps://www.sla.gov.sg/articles/press-releases/2016/sla-launches-new-online-service-myproperty-to-offer-free-access-to-title-information-for-property-owners,btohqsg
Or if u don’t have your own property  just read thisIt is an important document that contains:• A description of the property;• The nature of the estate (freehold or leasehold)• Details about interests or encumbrances (e.g. mortgages) of the property; and• The owner of the property (therefore proving ownership of the property as well).https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/property-title-deeds-amend-copy/,btohqsg
