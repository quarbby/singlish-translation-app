the floors arent as clean as u think,btohqsg
and restaurants provide u chairs for the bag,btohqsg

like u need be seated by staff,btohqsg
and if not enough chairs at table the staff will bring,btohqsg

90% of his comments are against him,btohqsg
I REMEMBER THIS SPECIFIC TIKTOK NOW,btohqsg
He never say zi char but its kinda implied from the way the restaurant worked,btohqsg
All ppl defending him are sg while all against are foreigners,btohqsg

Why watch 22 men kick 1 ball for 90 mins,btohqsg
and cuz i play football so can watch n learn :),btohqsg
If we just give them each 1 ball would be better what no need to fight for 90 mins,btohqsg
Let them kick till they happy,btohqsg
bruh I haven't done any work today,btohqsg
I ate but vomited it all out,btohqsg
Im in trouble coz1) i couldnt reach a bag in time so vomited on myself2) i reached home and felt nauseous again after attempting to wash the stain off my clothes…and vomited in the sink and im too scared to tell my parents3) i hv no way out coz my maid is still outside:-(,btohqsg
Because my mum jn alr scolded me for eating despite still feeling not completely alright and created trouble for my grandma’s helper,btohqsg
The thing is i feel giddy when looking at it:-(,btohqsg
Tbh been so long and i still hv not figured out the cause of my nausea episodes,btohqsg
It is like almost every time i get a headache  i will start vomiting 1h later,btohqsg
Sometimes this happens to me as well when I have a serious bad headache and my stomach is bloated from my dinner,btohqsg
After I vomitted out  usually will feel slightly better but still feel super awful,btohqsg
I personally have migraine episodes in case you are wondering,btohqsg
Actually that is same as me  recently like almost every week at least once,btohqsg
I don't have it that often tbh,btohqsg
Before that step  i need find cause first,btohqsg
isit right to be chanting amitufo at this late at night,btohqsg
Because only my relative (who is a few yrs older than me) understands me,btohqsg
The older people dun understand at all  either that or just cant be bothered to,btohqsg
Well I understand what you are going through,btohqsg
I really dun get it  like my mum clearly shows more concern towards my sibling’s wellbeing…i mean im the oldest child but not being there for me even when im just becoming weaker,btohqsg
