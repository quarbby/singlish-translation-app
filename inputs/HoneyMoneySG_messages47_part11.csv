Hi all  can I ask if UOB One card‚Äôs additional cashback (5-6.67%) for certain partners (dairy farm  shopee  simolygo) only applies after you hit a $500 min? Or it is all counted into the $500min but rewarded higher than normal purchases.Apologies if my question is a little unclear.,btohqsg
Is UOB lady 6 mpd for max 1k or 3k?,btohqsg
Depends on whether more elevated  or elevated lady,btohqsg
Same here.1. Pay for uob credit card2. Pay income tax3. Pay property tax4. Pay town council.But now double down. Ownself pay ownself salary ü§£,btohqsg
Normal uob lady 1k cap (1 selected cat)  lady solitaire cap at 3k spending for your selected 2 cat,btohqsg
e.g  If spend $500 on shopee (min 5 transactions) for all 3 months of qualifying quarter  get $50 quarterly rebate AND 3√ó5%√ó$500 bonus rebate,btohqsg
a bit embarrassing for guys to use even if can apply..,btohqsg
Nope.. Someone did a video on cc benefits  and mention guys also can apply,btohqsg
Is that DBS WWMC instead that you remembered?,btohqsg
For uob theres a credit card app can see overall. But ocbc i cant seem to find an app. The ibanking app also cant see my credit card. Anyone knows whr to find it? Or is there even an ‚Äúapp‚Äù for it,btohqsg
Cashback+  and since you brought it up  the AMEX one as well,btohqsg
AMEX true cashback worth it? I dont spend that much ie. below 500 on most months,btohqsg
What type of spending is it? If it is usual expenses like dining and groceries  I recommend HSBC Revolution for 2.5% instead of TCB 1.5%,btohqsg
I only want to focus on utilities  sp services  occasionally cabs/grabs. More to those fixed payments per mth,btohqsg
what about ur bus/mrt/groceries/telco etc? If can consistently clock $500 every month can use uob one card instead.,btohqsg
Was thinking of uob one too. But i see my transact history of telc bills   transport  utilities didnt rack up to 500.,btohqsg
HSBC no min spend too right.,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution no min spend and no annual fees,btohqsg
no min spend but no 10x points (4mpd or 2.5%) for utilities  telco  public transport,btohqsg
Hsbc rev seems alot better for me. I missed out on this. Thanks shifus!,btohqsg
Citi rewards will give 10x rewards on telco bills?,btohqsg
Question. Is Apple Pay or google pay considered online transactions?,btohqsg
