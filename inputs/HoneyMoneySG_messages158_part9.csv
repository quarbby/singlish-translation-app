Why Bank of China seems less popular than OCBC360 and UOBone? I see their recent Smartsaver account interest seems good.,btohqsg
How do we pay via CF card for tax or education,btohqsg
Care to share if u need all aspects to fulfill the 1k? I use sp group app  train hdb carpark payments,btohqsg
for tax via cardup/ipaymy. education can pay direct? if not then cardup/ipaymy,btohqsg
Yes cos annual limit is 104k. 20% of that is 20400(which is your own contribution NOT factoring in your employer). This is also assuming you only have one job paying you CPF,btohqsg
Then need to calculate carefully before hitting FRS and make full use of the $37740-$20400=$17 340 yearly to maximise the tax relief. Once hitting FRS  this tax relief door is closed.,btohqsg
My $10.10 package is good enough for me.,btohqsg
Yes. That's if you want the tax relief la.,btohqsg
hi everyone  i believe previously when signing up for HSBC TravelOne card  even if you already have an existing HSBC card  you may be eligible for the sign up gifts. do anyone happen to know if it‚Äôs the same situation for this promo?,btohqsg
If we top up VCMA say in the beginning of the year and knowing that we will hit $37740  does it means employer will pay less contribution to us?,btohqsg
confused by this month's HSBC EGA promo - the 2.9% is paid on topup difference between Feb and Mar?,btohqsg
and then +1% on the same topup difference between Feb and Mar?,btohqsg
forever .. I‚Äôve been with them for a long time ..,btohqsg
In my layman view without providing any financial advice:I don‚Äôt like chocolate because they rugpull on their card being used at axs to earn rewards when they were the ones to openly advertise it.But in all fairness chocolate was never in any serious trouble which cannot be resolved if given enough time to sell their investment holdings in line with their policies.The instant withdrawal feature was actually clearly mentioned in their tnc to be a bonus feature which could removed anytime and customers will get back their money only during the usual funds settlement period.Remember when u put money into chocolate  your funds are invested into funds.Not investment advice just saltiness from granny.,btohqsg
Does lady's card ordering via qr code in restaurant earn miles?,btohqsg
Yes if mcc is under bonus category,btohqsg
Seem like it. Trying to find place to buy w credit card to earn Miles. Any guru know where can still get the vouchers will still earn the miles?,btohqsg
If via sing saver or moneysmart it will state if existing members eligible. If nothing stated then default is no. T&Cs will also say clearly,btohqsg
Does monthly iCloud subscription qualifies for 4mpd using DBS WWMC?,btohqsg
Hi All  was checking on Heymax for cardup - it refers to Maybank platinum visa and UOB One card as best options with 3.3% cashback. please advise if correct,btohqsg
If I refer you  why would the banker need to meet me?Or are you asking if anyone here is interested in becoming a hsbc premier client?,btohqsg
Can I check if there is no SGD denominated ETF for S&P 500? Means I have to do UT if I dont want to convert to USD..,btohqsg

Thanks is there cap on maybank plat?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  does anyone know if I can earn bonus miles by purchasing furniture and appliances with the UOB Lady‚Äôs Card? Which category should I choose?,btohqsg
If you would like to play the cashback game for Maybank Platinum  I'd suggest you familiarize with the mechanics. There's a good chance you'll get zero if you do not fulfill the tncs.,btohqsg
Uob lady > fashion> heymax> courts> 5311  but it better to use OCBC rewards card for this,btohqsg
For iCloud purchase  crmc award 10x point right?But when we add crmc to our payment method on iPhone  there is an option to link it to Apple Pay.If we link it  will it disqualify the 10x points?,btohqsg
max 2k per month  must be consistent spend throughout the quarter,btohqsg
crmc + apple pay = ‚ùå,btohqsg
But I haven‚Äôt chose the option to link yetDoes this still  counts as Apple Pay?,btohqsg
you should never add crmc to apple pay,btohqsg
So even adding to the device itself counts as Apple Pay?Not quite sure if Apple Pay means adding to Apple wallet only,btohqsg
both in-app apple pay and contactless apple pay are disqualified,btohqsg
My view if you key your credit card detail into their portal/app for payment to be as online.,btohqsg
contactless ok for whitelisted fashion mccs,btohqsg
For my city rewards card? Normally i will get my statement on 19th.What date is my reset date for 1k limit to get 4point.Its is start on month or 19th?,btohqsg
Experts  I'm kinda confused why my chocolate account experienced negative returns when my balance is below 50k? I thought first 50k is garaunteed returns of 3.3/3%? Or m I mistakened?,btohqsg
I seem to have clocked more than 2k max miles on chocolate this month,btohqsg
You can get unlimited 0.4mpd beyond the first 1k,btohqsg
CF is not a bank. Capital is not guaranteed.  The returns is the so-called interest or dividends they pay you. The underlying fund still can lose money. If you really just want to have your money safe  put inside banks pls. Got a few good saving accounts now.,btohqsg
