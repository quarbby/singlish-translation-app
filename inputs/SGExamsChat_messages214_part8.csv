A lot of polytechnic students have no portfolio for PSC,btohqsg

I think PSC wants to diversify their pool,btohqsg
So your CCA achievements are all from Sec school?,btohqsg
I was a noob that fked up As went poly,btohqsg

Propagate a story of you fighting against the odds I think it’ll help your chances,btohqsg

Social person can earn money better mah?,btohqsg
They probably have an unwritten quota to hire some poly people to look good on their reports,btohqsg
There’s PSC scholars from ITE too,btohqsg
And a lot less poly people try to apply for those scholarship than jc people,btohqsg
But they simply exist to prove ‘diversity and a lack of discrimination in the government’,btohqsg
They love stories of going against the odds to find success like that,btohqsg
