Amex>grab>YouTrip gets the Amex rebates using paynow on grab,btohqsg
It’s still a good combi to use with Citi rewards Mastercard,btohqsg
Still have? I haven’t gotten anything after using for 1 month +,btohqsg
Sorry I have a question not related to finance. A minecraft edition icon suddenly appear on my desktop. anyone experienced this?,btohqsg
Do you get grabpoints when trsf from grab to youtrip?,btohqsg
Refer to the updated Amaze cashback terms.Since the last update to points system  no more min spendhttps://www.instarem.com/en-ca/amaze,btohqsg
1) Amex topup to grab using credit card to get Amex rewards2) Use Grabpay to scan youtrip's Paynow QR code to topup youtripNo points for grabpay  but you get amex rewards  + the money on youtrip is on credit instead of straight out of wallet.,btohqsg
I do that for my Revolut,btohqsg
In general I find that youtrip’s rates are better than Revolut. What’s your take?,btohqsg
I find that Youtrip rates are better in Asia while Revolut has better rates in Western countries but from time to time I always just compares,btohqsg
How do you guys see the rate in the revolut app?,btohqsg
hmmm... this points kinda hard to use though,btohqsg
You can check youtrip rates from xe currency and revolut has their own website to check the rates on that day.,btohqsg
Morning guys  which cards would you recommend for free lounge access? I don't travel frequently  maybe just once or twice every year  so credit cards with annual fees are not for me,btohqsg
I had a video on this  let me find,btohqsg
Anyone familiar with using revolut for overseas transfer to US? Trying to fund a brokerage account. Would you say that revolut offers the lowest fees and fx rate already?,btohqsg
I used amex true cashback  so 1.5%,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone here use gpmc to pay for prudential insurance here. Is there grab reward point for it?,btohqsg
Did anyone experienced grabpay card rejected at the train gantry? It says my card was black listed but i didn’t do any funny thing to the card..,btohqsg
instarem card can pay axs insurance?,btohqsg
Got rejected at nitroi @ heenan use grab but use other card ok,btohqsg
But no issue on grab when use on other maybe nitori at heenan the pos got issues,btohqsg
I tried DBS multi currency account debit card for MYR  shitty rates. on 28 Jul got 3.1 when I got 3.2 on youtrip. 3% difference,btohqsg
No point as MCC still goes through,btohqsg
Do ji pay still got Cashback now? I don't see any info on their website,btohqsg
All nerf. Now except for special deals in grab. Now jipay no use already.,btohqsg
You trip card still the best.  Maybe revolut but i hv no experience with it.. any one compared revolut to youtrip here?,btohqsg
I didn’t compare the rate between YouTrip and Revolut. But I use Amex -> Grab to top up Revolut to earn Amex 1.5% or 1.7%. And Revolut allows you to withdraw the money back to your bank. Unless someone proven that Revolut has lower rates I’ll keep using it.,btohqsg
But being said that  I confirmed that Revolut charges 1% “weekend fee”  so maybe having a secondary card like YouTrip  amaze or even wise card for weekend might be better. Or you could just use cash for weekends.,btohqsg
Revolut stikl got the Cashback when u top up with bank to use on MRT,btohqsg
A merchant category code (MCC) is a four-digit number used by credit card companies to classify businesses.,btohqsg
How about use amex true cash back + grab to fav pay or shop back? Fav pay or shop back which is better to get double dip on amex & grab,btohqsg
Can be done to Top up grab  earn the cash back and use grab card to earn the points .@ChrisHMSGdid share a video on this before.It was something like 2.5% for top cash back + grab points for platinum status grab,btohqsg
Hihi  can anyone help me out regarding credit cards?Was wondering why use citi rewards + instarem instead of hsbc revolution for earning miles?,btohqsg
Amex > grabpay nerf for new users from 15 aug,btohqsg
what! Ok then just get the UOB one instead,btohqsg
Yep new users go for UOB  but I think after my 5k with AMEX Ill continue with them bcos their support really solid,btohqsg
To be clear: this only affects the new sign up bonus 3%. The normal 1.5% party still goes on for now,btohqsg
Can I ask.. UOB 1.7% and AMEX 1.5%.. why you prefer a lower cashback % ah?,btohqsg
- customer support good- Im just fresh grad  goal is to save $ so I wont be spending a lot now  0.2% x $5000 only $10- maybe next time can consider  I apply for too many credit cards in a few months might affect my credit score?,btohqsg
It’s 3% for the Amex initial $5k for the first six months.,btohqsg
hihi anyone can help with this? 😅,btohqsg
Cause last time AMEX still have the 3% $5000  UOB don’t have. So I get AMEX first  glad that I done that before it nerfed,btohqsg
trying to decide which miles card to pick right now  not sure to choose citi rewards and pair it with instarem vs hsbc revolution 😭Not sure what the difference will be?,btohqsg
Where can I see these deals ah?,btohqsg
The latest honey money video talks about miles cards. Can look at that,btohqsg
I’m more for credit card churning. So the actual card benefit doesn’t affects me.,btohqsg
The key is to get the sign up bonus. So every month sign up one card and charge all your spending thru that. But the trick is to not spending on things that you need.,btohqsg
So let say I want to buy a $1000 iPhone this month  I go singsaver or moneysaver and saw Citi cash back spend $800 and get Dyson vacuum. But I also saw UOB one spend $600 and get airpod pro. I want airpod pro but not vacuum. So I sign up UOB instead,btohqsg
You can try selling Dyson on carousell  but you will see a lot people selling the same Dyson the same month you redeem it.,btohqsg
