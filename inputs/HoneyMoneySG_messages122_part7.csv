These platforms have multiple mccs so might not code as eligible mcc.Qoo10/Lazada you can choose fashion but use it in the form of voucher from heymax with mcc 5311.,btohqsg
Ya I see heymax show 5311. But if I buy electronic  the MCC won't be 5311 ?,btohqsg
buy direct from platform  nobody will know the actual coded mcc.,btohqsg
if heymax voucher is your chosen route  then ocbc rewards is a better choice.,btohqsg
Icic. So is buy voucher from heymax  to get 5311 ?,btohqsg
how often does the hsbc ega have their bonus interest promos?,btohqsg
Just like to highlight if buy with lazada voucher  the total amt eligible for discount will drop if using coupon. So better take note. Also have alot of issue when need to do refund as code use cant be reissue i think,btohqsg
every month has new promo unless they choose to stop it,btohqsg
generally how much is the interest rate excluding the everyday+ 1%,btohqsg
oh yes. 100% agree on this. only use lazada voucher if item not applicable for vouchers (apple products and infant stage 1 2 powder as example)Qoo10 is fine as its a wallet system. refunds go back to wallet(qmoney).,btohqsg
If without bonus interest promo also is 0.05%,btohqsg
Standard base interest for accounts. Got some 0.03% base interest.,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt have to do anything for the promo interest right?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  have u already get the 8% interest for the HSBC Fullerton SGD Cash Fund after 30 days?,btohqsg

Hey  is it possible for you to ping me directly? Need to understand what you mean? Thanks,btohqsg
Sorry  read till I confused.1) Correct me if I am wrong. You all pair AMAZE with Uob Kf  due to overseas spending?Understand if via Kris+ is 3mpd.2) But how about normal spending in local?  e.g normal dinning in restaurant  shopping / furniture @ ikea/ courts.. could use paywave without AMAZE with it and earn those normal 1.2 miles right?3) if online purchase other airline ticket (e.g Non Singapore airline) / hotel booking  we still have 1.2mpd also right?,btohqsg
Hi all  DBS woman‚Äôs world is 4mpd for online purchase (max $1.5k) and 1.2mpd for overseas purchase.Do you know if I charge air tix of usd$1.5k (ard sgd 2k)  which scenario does it get me:1Ô∏è‚É£ Sgd$1.5k @ 4mpd then the rest Sgd$500 @ 1.2mpdOr2Ô∏è‚É£ Sgd$2k @ 1.2mpd (overseas spend category),btohqsg
Hi all  can I check crmc+amaze for jewelry spent  is it eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
I just found a new secret place to buy gold,btohqsg
