Hi everyone  I‚Äôm trying to understand how this Moomoo platform works for Fullerton SG Cash Plus.1. I have $30k to invest. The T&C states ‚Äòcomplete 8 cumulative buy trades‚Äô. Is there a way I should split the $30k deposit into 8 buy trades? eg. 3k x 8 times + 6k x 1x?2. If I do not use up the $30k deposit for buy trades  where does the money go?3. The T&C states ‚Äòredeem rewards before 9:59PM SGT on 8/4/2024.‚Äô Where do I redeem the rewards?,btohqsg
Do we get notify via email once amex true cashback card is approved?,btohqsg
in email i only see application received,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not that bad  the main difficulty is dodging UOB$ merchants. That aside  it‚Äôs a fairly straightforward online + mobile tap with min spend and standard exclusions.Must cherish it before it gets nerfed like Frank and Live Fresh.,btohqsg
have to monitor and split agar half half loh $300 $300,btohqsg
can even go higher of 350 / 250 since sometimes contactless is harder to hit,btohqsg
Second this... else i think UOB One? Not too sure about cashback card but it seems like the clear choice to me,btohqsg
Quite ok to track for EVOL  and technically no need zhun zhun 300 300  350 250 works too so there‚Äôs room for error. Maybank 5 cats even harder even with their tracker which don‚Äôt count unposted.,btohqsg
The annoying part about UOB One is the 3 month block (miss one month due to a late posting transaction and your whole quarter GG) and the bonus cashback tracking (I had missing bonus cashbacks in the past that took several months to resolve). Good thing is it‚Äôs not impacted by UOB$ merchants. Quite rewarding card if u spend a lot on the bonus merchants (e.g. SP  Grab  Shopee  DFI  McD),btohqsg
Anyone purchase Equity Fund in moomoo? looks interesting,btohqsg
You can split the 30k in different amounts and subscribe to the cash plus fund 8 times.Reward redemption you can go to the me tab and click my rewards.,btohqsg
I suggest if you want to fund 30k you can use the entire amount to subscribe the cash plus funds to get the interest.,btohqsg
Hi  for standard chartered prudential platinum  is there a monthly cap to their 0.29mpd insurance payment??,btohqsg
There is also a clause that u have to keep at least 10k for 90 days in order to unfreeze the rewards,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt claim for both  that‚Äôs for sure. But as to which one came first  I don‚Äôt see how anyone in the group here can answer that for you üòÇ,btohqsg
First  wish to understand if you have already registered for moomoo  and have you deposited any funds.  I have just finished the 6.8% guaranteed return period  have got the extra bonus promised by moomoo and has withdrawn out the return.  There is also reward US stocks given  therefore  you need to understand which promotion you are offered. Need help  give me a note. I have spoken to moomoo customer support many times to understand their marketing terms and conditions and misleading messages.,btohqsg
Yes  trade 8 times to subscribe your 30k  doesn‚Äôt matter if it is 7 times 1$ each and 8 times balance.  Yes must lock 10k for 90 days to get the us stocks for my promotion case.,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wanted to ask which platform would you recommend for a newbie long term investor? Choosing between WeBull or IBKR,btohqsg
IBKR has better fx for usd,btohqsg
main issue is spread. IBKR over weBull anyday,btohqsg
Compared 3 platforms here: Webull  Syfe  IBKR.https://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=fsBhSY-uxmCr_sq9I'm using IBKR myself,btohqsg
Ibkr  cheaper fx spread and access to more mkt,btohqsg
Just curious  will UOB launch any promo for April? Any need to empty UOB one account before 28 Mar? Pls share if anybody knows. Thx,btohqsg
Any advice for upcoming 6m t bill cut off yield bid?,btohqsg
Yes  bid the rate u wan. If for some strange reason u wan it no matter what  then jus put 0.1%,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask the money that set aside for Rising Dragon Savings Promotion.Is it still eligible for UOB one account interest rate 7.8% throughout the locking period of 4months ?,btohqsg
Think about it Why would anyone put money in the promo for 4 months if it means losing out 420 every month? lol,btohqsg
IBKR  financially more stable and less risk,btohqsg
Hello does anyone know if SC E$aver account is better or UOB one account is better for savings below $50k,btohqsg
Did u managed to complete 108 spins?,btohqsg
