for me  since my holdings is tiny weenie... i dont care about the voting rights... so i go for cheaper one.. GOOG,btohqsg
For GOOG there is a fee for holding it right?,btohqsg
While GOOGL is a fee during purchase  am I right?,btohqsg
just different share classes with different voting power,btohqsg
it is irrelevant for us retail investors,btohqsg
there will be transaction cost depending on your broker,btohqsg
Thank you so much for clearing my misconceptions,btohqsg
Can check when does revolut cashback comes in?,btohqsg
does anyone have any dp about how the Revolut cashback is tracked for each month? For eg I took a bus trip in Jan  but Revolut only deducted 10c so far as holding fee (without billing/charging/processing the actual fare yet  as this process takes time). So will the cashback for Jan be based on all fares that have been processed as of 31 Jan (which means that this will exclude some fares that were made in Jan  such as those not yet billed/charged to Revolut per se)?,btohqsg
Is it safe to give your credit card number and expiry date (no cvv given) to dominos pizza?,btohqsg
just make sure they are dominos pizza,btohqsg
you can try Revolut and generate a one-time virtual card for merchants you don't trust,btohqsg
(remember to use Chris's referral link for RevolutðŸ¤ª),btohqsg
And another thing to note  even without CVV  some merchants can still charge from your card. So be careful,btohqsg
Can amex use in axs payment app,btohqsg

gemini still better in terms of fees for withdrawal and for purchasing,btohqsg

Just watched the video. Just to ask didn't see any comparison between hodlnaut & CDC?,btohqsg
CDC is staking  which means you need to lock it in. Hodlnaut can withdraw at will,btohqsg
but yeah  i should include CDC for fair comparison,btohqsg
Yup. Guess got to choose between flexibility and interest rate,btohqsg
CDC has so many staking options.,btohqsg
Recently I just signed up for CDC card because I watched all the credit card videos. Basically to reduce my spending.,btohqsg
"I just started to learn all the skating options  CDC has ""Earn""  ""Supercharger""  ""Defi wallet"" and ""Exchange"".",btohqsg
congrats. staking at CDC is a great first step,btohqsg
can take some time to explore other crypto platforms.e.g CRO staking in keplir wallet offers much higher interest rates.Also  you can stake your eth/btc elsewhere to earn more than 7% APR,btohqsg
Anyone have use the grab card for YouTube subscription having prob to add in,btohqsg
