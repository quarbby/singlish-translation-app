I would say donâ€™t have to mind too much  more towards the Citi side is the more of concerns ~If you know you total always below $1k should be goodDue to that you will use direct CRMC instead of amaze + CRMCLike online shopping shopeeOr Favepay / shopback or grab you using CRMC directly instead of using the combo,btohqsg
I thought you donâ€™t like to use UOB Ladies in Japan ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Still waiting for granny to join Amex plat,btohqsg
"Amaze + whatever for the right mcc is technically ""best"" but Japan donkey mcc is too much risk :)",btohqsg
my trip to japan using CC was basically a huge disappointment  all their restaurants MCC were finance MCC....... i think japan better just focus on getting better rates :D,btohqsg
It is actually the most rewarding in Japan. But have to check mcc before using.Troublesome but rewarding.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have watch. Cannot qualify,btohqsg
Have to practice using amaze plus empty wallet.,btohqsg
Hi  what would be the best credit cards to clock miles for hotel wedding under MCC 7011? Payment via online payment links.,btohqsg

I donâ€™t have watch either  only Fitbit,btohqsg
I buy yen when it low & keep in revolut & pay with it's win win,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask if the Stan Chart Smart Card good for only MRT/bus usage? I am currently using UOB one  and barely hitting the $500/mth requirement.,btohqsg
UOB one would be better if you are already barely hitting $500. You donâ€™t want to make that lesser. 8.33% if you can hit $500  and 5% thereafter. Not too much different from 6% SC Smart. But itâ€™s a good alternative if you have already hit $500  and need extra for rides & fast foods since there is no minimum spend. Plus sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there any point to link uob lady card to instarem amaze if i only do local transaction such as grab rides and in store dining?,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your reply. I will still calculate and re-evaluate  cheers,btohqsg
3.33% base cashback (if he hits $500) + 5% additional cashback for bus/mrt,btohqsg
UOB Ladies no point to use amaze for local SGD transactions  unless you just want to track MCC.,btohqsg
Im new to credit cards   can credit cards be added to ï£¿ pay ?,btohqsg
So i can only earn instapoints if i take a grab ride or dine in JB for example. N i have to pay/tab with the amaze card rite?,btohqsg
Oh  the 5% is on specific partners. Thus only the value purchased from these partners. Cannot be added directly to this 3.33%,btohqsg
Yup 0.5 InstaPoint for every 1 SGD spent in foreign currency via your amaze wallet or linked card.,btohqsg
To clarify  the transaction must be charged in foreign currency not sgd rite?,btohqsg
Should be. I have not tried paying in SGD (i.e. DCC) while overseas using Amaze yet  sorry,btohqsg
Oh is it? Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve gotten from the videos. Can someone clarify? Thanks,btohqsg
What SW mentioned here with regard to simplygo transactions not included in the 3.33% cashback,btohqsg
Why not if your 500 is made up of this partners?,btohqsg
Actually why did you say that uob one is better if they are barely hitting 500? Means heâ€™s not even going to get the 3.33%  much less 8.33%,btohqsg
I am assuming that he has an UOB one account to clock as he sounds like he is trying to hit $500. But I could be wrong. Then it would not matter. But if he is already barely hitting $500  why would he spread the spend on another card & lose the interest?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA 3.x% bonus interest in for May 2024.,btohqsg
The caption for Chocolate Finance becomes Squirrel Save - just to feedback,btohqsg
Actually I have calculated. Because I realised altho I am spending around $500  I did not manage to hit their criteria for the $500. So basically just getting the 0.05% for the past few months,btohqsg
Around $500 is not $500 unfortunately. You're better off spending on no min spend cards if you can't meet the $500 spending criteria.,btohqsg
What are you spending on? Even insurance counts as bonus interest for uob one account,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if CRMC linked to amaze can earn 4 mpd if I use to pay bills on AXS using the pay+earn option (2.5% service fee)?,btohqsg
Nothing much  I don't eat out often. Just insurance plus transport plus tax,btohqsg
You can buy vouchers to hit if you are close,btohqsg
dun think can even use Amaze on AXS,btohqsg
Hmm ok thanks  I thought amaze is also Mastercard and hence can be used on AXS,btohqsg
CRMC don't earn miles on AXS in the first place,btohqsg
Iâ€™m in the midst of reshuffling around charging of cards and want to ensure I do hit $500pm on on Uob one. So my plan is to buy some Fairprice vouchers to meet the $500 if I fall short.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried using Kris+ with Citi smrt card? Can get 5% cashback??,btohqsg
Any confirmed dp on Kris+ Citi smrt? Works or excluded?,btohqsg
Online transaction  yes  can. Note min spend $500/month,btohqsg
For the SC trading account  is there a minimum trade amount? Is there any inactivity fee charge?,btohqsg
"For hsbc  anyone managed to get confirmation if giro payments are included in ""withdrawn""?",btohqsg
has anyone tried if cardup/ipay with dbs altitude card miles still work for insurance payments?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check  if I use Citibank Rewards + Amaze card for Grab food delivery  will I get 4mpd? or will it be classified under travel?,btohqsg
Grabfood is under dining. Itâ€™s already online  you donâ€™t have to use with Amaze,btohqsg
