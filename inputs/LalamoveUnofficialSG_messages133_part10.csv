I kena before. The fella is a loan shark  now call lalamove go knock on people door,btohqsg
Additional $15 dont forget to ask. Purchasing fees for eateries,btohqsg
So let say we call the loan shark prior and confirm order  do we still get cancellation fee? ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
This kinda punks only pay cash. Cash orders difficult to claim cancellation fees.,btohqsg
Yes  u have proof of the call logs to provide lalamove to ensure that u call b4 making your move to collection point u will be compensate 50% cancellation fees.,btohqsg
Still can. 50% cancellation fees will be made via credit and u have to fill in jotform.,btohqsg
Yup2. Previously not this bad. Normally we partners will wait for customer to plus few more $$ then we accept. But nowdays so many hungry partners even small fees they faster grab. So  when customer sees that  they wont bother to add additional $$ and will stay thay low pricing cause to them  they will be so confident that there will be partners who will take the job.. this type of partners is the one spoiling the market. Work smart not hard. But end of the day its up to individuals.,btohqsg
What to doðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬  hope these spoil market cheapo canâ€™t tahan after taking so many LJ fares. Then the smart guys will come ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Usually the weekends all the monkeys come out and anyhow accept. Haiz! ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
Cash orders cancellation fee made via credit? In the 1st place llm can't even get the cancellation fee from the scammer. So how to pay u,btohqsg
Can bro. Its consider llm fault. We as partners  just doing our job following the procedure. But make sure u have the call logs with the sender to provide in the jotform.,btohqsg
The scammers won't pick up the call 1. If u say can claim. Then just keep taking all the scam jobs which are cash jobs then keep cancelling. Those +300 scam cash jobs.,btohqsg
When jobs demand drop  n drivers supply sky rocket  sure prices will drop,btohqsg

Confirm your head  cash order customer don't want pay LLM cs lala how to pay you,btohqsg
How u know its ah long job.. can let me know?,btohqsg
U let me know how to know its ah long?,btohqsg
Already received my compensate also. Half the amount as i've already arrived at sender location.,btohqsg
My head correct lah benson  i received already compensation. Work smart.. be rational not emotional.,btohqsg
In delivery line for 20yrs already. If dont know asked. If not sure  asked.,btohqsg
This is credit order  cs can play me like this,btohqsg
As long as u call the user/sender they mention saying that order confirm and what item to be delivered u may proceed to the pick up location. If its a scam order or u arrived and they cancelled on the job u may get the compensation. In another case  if u call user no answer dont proceed and go live chat and update them the user is not reachable they will cancel for you. Simple.,btohqsg
Yes  been there b4...CS also mia me.. so all this is a learning curve for us. The experience that will make us more competent.,btohqsg
Never ask me call log then anyhow say,btohqsg
Llm platform is the worst platform.. so  as long as u know how to handle & tackle the situation i guess it should be fine.. we have to be more independent and street smart.. work smart  keep all evidence for later part in case there's any issue.,btohqsg
Anyway  im just sharing what can be done. No obligations.. sharing for those who need to know.,btohqsg
