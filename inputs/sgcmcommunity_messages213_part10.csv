I drive vezel everyday east to west nothing only,btohqsg
Also like steering rack expensive sia ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Pfl vezel hybrid like strawberry lol but most pfl Vezel hybrid after 100k susceptible to wear and tear issues,btohqsg
E.g. gear 1  clutch seals  etc,btohqsg
Suv supposed to be bumpy ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Reliable as in 4 yrs i got no issue.. but surprisingly mileage a bit lacking compared to my current older elantra.. i refer current sedan as less bumpy and more stable on road at 130km above too.,btohqsg
Guess both are gd cars.. just personal preference on drive  comfort & experience etc,btohqsg
Depreciation wise.. korean cars are cheaper n easier to maintain too,btohqsg
Kona or via Niro 175 179kHonda vezel 145 155k,btohqsg
I had sonata and kona. Rear seat make passengers more nauseous.,btohqsg
Compared to when I changed to toyota and honda,btohqsg
Ours is preown 8yrs old. Super rough handling,btohqsg
Im not sure if previous owner changed the suspension or not,btohqsg
Sounds like alot of wear n tear not replaced.,btohqsg
Not sure. But why would someone use a normal vezel to do phv,btohqsg
Vezel is a popular PHV model lei,btohqsg
Shldnt it be the hybrid model?,btohqsg
Why would ppl drive chr as phv? Wont the passenger just cancel? I sat in 1 before and vowed to nv sit in another again...,btohqsg
There's petrol too. There r ppl who don't like hybrid,btohqsg
I drove the chr 1.2t model as PHV before,btohqsg
I have a BMW X5. The rear seats are great. You wouldn't feel nauseous. U try.,btohqsg
You can try BMW X5. The suspension is great. I have the X5  suspension is better than many SUVs.,btohqsg
I believe g63 will be even better,btohqsg
Obviously u donno abt conti suv. X5 is 7 seater but g class isnâ€™t,btohqsg
In China  nickname for x5 is King of the road but not g class. U know why?,btohqsg
I only know this is SGCarMart  not China car mart.,btohqsg
Lol wad abt Cina cars selling in sgcarmart?,btohqsg
Heard cina cars top the sales,btohqsg
Sooner or later will have to rebrand to Ccm,btohqsg
Wow.. kona or niro seems overpriced compared to vezel.. ha..If get 2nd hand electra or cerato better. Much lower depreciation..if you just need wheel . Dun care suv or sedan..,btohqsg
That is hyundai and kia cheapest car,btohqsg
Suzuki every also can. See how low u want to go.,btohqsg
X5? Pfft try a maybach instead,btohqsg
Is sports car suspension v harsh?,btohqsg
Depends on the driver. To the sports car owner it may not be,btohqsg
Howâ€™s your question related to my answer?,btohqsg
Lol how is it not related?,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
Think need to see what features do the two vehicles have as compared to the vezel.,btohqsg
No.. very soft like rolls Royce,btohqsg
Way more features than the vezel,btohqsg
How can this happen ðŸ˜®..inside speed controlled tunnel too somemore.,btohqsg
May I ask if the licence  plate can front the long rectangular type and behind also long rectangular one.  Or,btohqsg
The space on your car is long you use the long one. If it's square you use square... if can put nobody stop you unless it risks falling out,btohqsg
Just color  font got regulation only,btohqsg
The carplate maker usually will advise you which one LTA compliant ah... so don't install liao act blur can liao,btohqsg
So can install both same long rectangular in one single line.  That's good,btohqsg
Or donâ€™t install liao  later sabo people.,btohqsg
See if to the buyer the extra features worth 20 30k more. Or buyer cannot afford.,btohqsg
With high car price one may look for a to b car. With boot space to their needs.,btohqsg
