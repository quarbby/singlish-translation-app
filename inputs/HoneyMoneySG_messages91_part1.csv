If I pair UOB Krisflyer CC with its Krisflyer savings accounts  that should boost my miles further by a lot right,btohqsg
My exp here  cashback will be credited next day after giro payment (credit card) deducted.,btohqsg
Uob Krisflyer is only for OTA.,btohqsg
I mean what does OTA stands for?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúWhat OTA‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
Can pay with kris + which is considered OTA right? Earning 4mpd++ the Krisflyer saving account bonus mpdThat should add up a lot no?,btohqsg
Hello! Just to check why shouldn‚Äôt use Kris+ to pay for travel agency package? :o it doesn‚Äôt retain the 4722 MCC or it‚Äôs an exclusion stated somewhere?,btohqsg
A reply not far above said kris+ is not 4722,btohqsg
Yea and this too because all Kris+ transactions are worth 3mpd right?,btohqsg
Ahhh but what if it‚Äôs KF UOB & Kris+ to pay for a package at travel agency? Should be ok I think? ü§î,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too. Coupled with the Kris savings account.,btohqsg
Right‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll test it out if I can (my travel agency might apply for kris+ partner),btohqsg
How much money you keep in UOB KF account? There is a cap on max miles you can earn based on your saving in account.It is 5% of your MAB only.,btohqsg
Assuming we keep 100k in uob kris savings instead of one account.. the 5% cap should not be reachable right,btohqsg
Either way  we can always split our payments if it exceed the 5% MAB right,btohqsg
Personally i dont see how this will beat the uob one plus uob lady solitaire combo thou,btohqsg
It‚Äôs around 10mpd with salary creditingAccount = 6Card = 3Kris+ = 1,btohqsg
Hi guru  is it possible to change the OCBC 90N CC billing cycle?,btohqsg
Bonus miles cap at 60k per year  so  over 10k spending will break the cap,btohqsg
I just play ard uob website based on your 100k mab  no matter how i adjust cant go over 60k annual,btohqsg
Maybe is each month can earn max 60k based on 100k mab which is 2 month need to keep in for 20k spending spilt half,btohqsg
The screen shot above shows 63k bonus in a single month,btohqsg
That is based on 120k mab,btohqsg
Try to reply to the message so that the threads get continued for other to view with ease of reference,btohqsg
Oh ok I get what you mean,btohqsg
I believe $100k mab can earn max 5 000 miles per month.It means you are paying $416.67(UOB One acct opportunity cost) for 5 000 miles. That works out about 8.3 cents per mile.,btohqsg
The cheapest way to earn mile is still Lady 6mpd.,btohqsg
Haha  no wonder i think something is wrong coz i got count before that it is not worth. Coz i think now uob krisflyer acct got something like the rising dragon for new fund and i told my friend not worth it,btohqsg
Oh wow. Nice way of putting it across! Thanks! üôèSeems more like an option of choosing between cash interest or miles back. Ratios is kinda 1:1,btohqsg
Where got 1 to 1  i think the post mean u pay 8.3 cent per dollar so it is damn ex,btohqsg
SA does not accept paywave payments. I also used HSBC Adv  $2.8k pm,btohqsg
Hi all - any one tried and got feedback for tpg home broadband,btohqsg
Hi guys  any idea how to upload e-signature for my HSBC account? Tried to apply for giro for my IRAS tax but got rejected as I didn't have a signature with the bank,btohqsg
You need to go to the bank branch and register your signature.,btohqsg
Hi  u have to go down physically to any hsbc branch to do the signature.,btohqsg
"I spoke to the CSO they said can upload via ""supporting documents"" but I couldn't find it.",btohqsg
The CSO at the branch personally told me that I have to go down to the branch to do it lol,btohqsg
anyone knows if fwd is excluded from hsbc revolution miles?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Not worth it for $100 n below anymore,btohqsg
For recurring payments- iPayMy : 1.85% + $1- Cardup : 1.85%Seems like might have to switch to Cardup soon.,btohqsg
Luckily I locked in 1.79% already.Time to jump,btohqsg
Even with 1.79%  the breakeven is only if you charge more than $1666.67.,btohqsg
Need some opinions. Planning a holiday in june and will be have 4.5k on flights but my main cards are citi rewards/hsbc rev are fully utilised.,btohqsg
I have wwmc / SIA Amex / citi PM,btohqsg
Should i apply SC journey just to get bonus miles?,btohqsg
All the mighty mind here. I saw somewhere  Dbs world women miles count for Singtel recursive bills  anyone can confirm?,btohqsg
