Hey guys  so I was planning on getting the citi rewards card  but I don't have a citibank account. Would yall recommend opening an account first for ease of paying bill or just go for the card itself?,btohqsg
if you already have other bank accounts that you are sticking with  then no need to open a Citibank account. It is not difficult to pay Citi CC bills with other banks.,btohqsg
Hi Chris will you do a video talking about buying overseas properties?,btohqsg
Not as not now  no knowledge,btohqsg
Hey guys  want to ask if CRMC with Kris+ will get 10x points?,btohqsg

previously i used youtribe to pump petrol in JB.But the Citi cash back Plus don't count youtrip for cashback.Right now  if i use instarem( Link with Citi cash back Plus) and pump petrol in JB  will my cashback be counted ?,btohqsg
Any diff buy fr aq website or 3rd party exampletrip.com  google flight etc,btohqsg
But you can loop amaze+crmc through googlepay,btohqsg
Yes. A better card will be citi cashback 8% if you can hit the min spend,btohqsg
The price shouldn't be much different. Just book from the official site for less hassle,btohqsg

I'm clueless on the miles game..If my spending every month is about 700 on food   grocery   Internet  utilities.And 300 on petrol in jb.Is cashback or miles better?,btohqsg
Sounds like 8% Maybank Family & Friendshttps://hmsg.link/maybankfnfwill be good for you,btohqsg
Does ur app have the redeem function? It's based on the card that you are holding.,btohqsg
Otherwise you can send a sms to 72484 with the below code:RWDS #### CSHBK 201) #### is the last 4 digits of your cashback card that you want to redeem.2) CSHBK 10/20/50 in denominations of $10/$20/$50,btohqsg

Hello. Which credit card is  good  (visa/mastercard only) for  no minimum spend? Also is eligible for cashback for insurance & utility bills,btohqsg
no point.Cause most CC don't give Cashback for Youtrip transaction,btohqsg
Might as well just use amaze directly even though the Conversion fee is about 0.3% higher than youtrip,btohqsg

Mine doesn't have. But my wife there is a redeem button on the app. Might be it's different card type.Which I didn't bother to find out why as long as the sms function is able to do that,btohqsg
I saw something on their website stating the procedure for the sms text as such.,btohqsg
Amex true cashback > Grab (get 1.5% cashback)Grabpay > youtrip using paynow (no grab rewards),btohqsg
Is there any amount limit on the cashback,btohqsg
Most of the time. As long as you spend regularly (even with Grab top up),btohqsg
isit possible that i transfer 30k into grab  get the 1.5% on AMEX TCB  then withdraw the money from grab to my bank account  then use that 30k to pay back my AMEX TCB credit card bill?ðŸ˜®,btohqsg
When you top up Grab with a credit card  that amount is detected as being unable to be withdrawn to bank acct,btohqsg
What if I do a gpmc to revolut and cashout from there?,btohqsg
Don't play with Revolut unless you want your account freezed,btohqsg
Small amount it's ok 30k confirm revoult freezed.,btohqsg
Top up via cc can't draw out to bank unless it's debit,btohqsg
