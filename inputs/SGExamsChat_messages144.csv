So they r like school clerks onlyThats what i noticed - they r not like professional,btohqsg
yea  idk what happened after i graduated but i hope there have been some changes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
The place is like the place your school dumps old things.,btohqsg
you  dont study  and also dont make others study,btohqsg
Because they guarantee accomodation for four years and they are small  which I like,btohqsg
Oh the culture n attitude of ppl r better there la,btohqsg
The interviewer game me linear algebra questions,btohqsg
yes ^^ very true. i wonder if they are actually trained properly and not using their own 'methods' and 'beliefs' to counsel students,btohqsg
I heard others got it so easy,btohqsg
???? Such dramatic counsellor.. then end up she needs a counsellor herself ??ü§£,btohqsg
So much maths was done in trinity,btohqsg
And he agreed with me that mathematics olympiads are no good,btohqsg
Well  I wanted the accomodation guaranteed  so...,btohqsg
History doesn't mean much if not maintained,btohqsg
Cambridge is fkin insanely beautiful and the people there are amazing. Failing to get in made me regret not putting in effort for my IB and letting my brain rot in NS so I couldnt do as well for the entrance test as I could right after IB.,btohqsg
omg i have primary sch drama certs from trinity college ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Nono i wont reveal. It happened more than 10 years agonanyway,btohqsg
This is the most serious message I‚Äôve seen you send,btohqsg
The university Felix Klein worked in wasn't in the UK,btohqsg
Stanford is beauts  but really cambridge is something different,btohqsg
Some guy living there showed the view of his hostel,btohqsg
Yes my friend does  shes jc lecturer. But ok i shall not say more,btohqsg
But got max hours to prevent overwork,btohqsg
Oh. Ya then they r dead on the inside actually. Yes u hv a v good point there,btohqsg
I felt my inability to get into Cambridge was to do with two things completely out of my control:(1) doing H1 economics. I never had the choice to do H2 as the inital school i went to did not want to open a class for two students(2) not doing H3. The school I transferred to did not want me to take it as they wanted me to adjust to life in the new environment,btohqsg
all the more reason they shld step down or have their own annual evaluation done by higher authority,btohqsg
Ya but how come they have the time?? Arent they alr tied down by non teaching commitments? I think they need to get involved in school projects or if not  take charge of CCAs right,btohqsg
If you listen to someone who's in Camb  not sure about H2 being important  but H3 isn't important to Camb,btohqsg
YA YOU KNOW WHATS WORSE? I HAD NO EXCUSE. I HAD ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE PERFECT SUBJECT COMBINATION FOR THE COURSE. AND I BOTCHED IT UP,btohqsg
But the intervewer asked me if i did H3... I told him what my JC2 school said. What can I do?,btohqsg
Ionno  I not that interested in UK,btohqsg
It's fine. Not the end of the world...,btohqsg
NO LAH! What a questionStat is 40% of ur syllabus leh üòÇ,btohqsg
I mean im going to an ivy league so I guess its fine,btohqsg
I told him. Later he said see you next year  you are in,btohqsg
the worse part is that the counsellor is close friends with my class mentor and i have heard of sensitive info about someone spreading btw teachers.,btohqsg
Maybe that's why 90rp important I guess  cuz 'everyone' in RI has 4h2,btohqsg
Oh good. Good to be honest,btohqsg
see you next year then bye bye,btohqsg
and a teacher accidentally mentioned it in class,btohqsg
Huh... then how about the thousands below u?.. aiya then uni will be very empty alr lah,btohqsg
What can I do. I have a friend who also had the same interviewer. The interview had easy questions  and he didn't like the person...,btohqsg
imagine trusting a counsellor only for it to be used against u,btohqsg
I have heard of a similar scenario where a FT exposes a student  who was having family issue  in a class group chat,btohqsg
If they give good statements about you then can already,btohqsg
But for me  he said I did well  I'm in  see you next year,btohqsg
Huh?? She so daring uh. If ppl baotoh her the sch authority may look her up on leh,btohqsg
but he probably has to add in the no 4h2 1h3 part,btohqsg
tbh everyone is fake AC except barker,btohqsg
Yep. Very odd but whatever. I might not like the environment anyways,btohqsg
From what I heard interviewers might be alumnis and shit,btohqsg
Oh my scch amaths teacher also. If her students never show her the correct answer they cannot go home. Heng she never teach my class üòÇ,btohqsg
Nope. Professors flew in to Singapore and Malaysia and Shanghai and HK to interview people,btohqsg
do finish 1 paper and leave,btohqsg
You have to pay I think 100 odd pounds extra though,btohqsg
Cambridge people come into SG to interview,btohqsg
IcMy school dept all r really professional and dedicated  caring tooExcept those english teachers  a bit gabra and also or english teachers keep changing,btohqsg
But Oxford doesn‚Äôt do that any more,btohqsg
Why care abt sch depts doe,btohqsg
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THAT,btohqsg
They just living for paycheck lah,btohqsg
They still cover the syllabus so,btohqsg
I think it was okay. Vetted by people. I said I learnt Latex  did proofs here and there  read academic papers (mentioned a few I read) ,btohqsg
But do they do it in the best way?,btohqsg
I said I learnt linear algebra on my own,btohqsg
Because i can't understand the JC teachers!,btohqsg
I think my PS is kinda good too  I got into unis that didnt have interviews,btohqsg
I just suck at interviews lah,btohqsg
Whichc subject? She bio lecturer. But she became working mom alr so dun think she giving tuition outside sch anymor,btohqsg
I can't even string a proper sentence together at timesüôÇ,btohqsg
What is 'wts'? In mathematics it means 'want to show',btohqsg
I thought u supposed to be good speaker,btohqsg
limpeh wospec okay england no good  no need toilet  paper,btohqsg
Imagine someone is like wts in class then some random guy start taking out his note pad asking what do I have to solve or smth,btohqsg
Yes. They should have a 360degree appraisal contributed by students too dun u think so. In fact i feel teachers shd have their appraisals done by students,btohqsg
In all honesty  my english went down the drain after NS haha,btohqsg
Shld have asked 'what is limpeh',btohqsg
I can't understand a lot of JC notes,btohqsg
I had to use undergraduate texts,btohqsg
I can only understand clear  terse  abstract and succinct language,btohqsg
Specialist is just code for sergeant,btohqsg
it means what the shit ahahahah,btohqsg
HUH?! Bad. Anyway schools can be a toxic environment too cos all r humans. My jc had a teacher got sack for hitting on student. My poly lecturer also got sacked for making a foreign student pregnant. Anyway there is also lots of politics among sch teachers. And also school teachers complaining badmouthing about the principal etc etc,btohqsg
Because I don't really want to reveal which JC in front of 2000 people,btohqsg
eeyer time for Chad NSman to steal your girl in uni,btohqsg
I thought in Singapore teachers can hit students?,btohqsg
i really feel like eating egg yolks rn,btohqsg
Man already said he won‚Äôt reveal,btohqsg
Sounds like an exciting time you had in school.My schools mostly boring. Most excitement I ever heard was someone getting caned,btohqsg
stop. It's not. It is XJC where X is a word of one or two alphabets,btohqsg
Ya if even u at the top jc cannot go uni.. then the many jc students below u how,btohqsg

Oh one of my friends went from evergreen sec dae into rjc via floorball leh. How is this possible,btohqsg
Someone from my Sec school DSA into debate in acjc,btohqsg
But my Sec Sch doesn‚Äôt have debate,btohqsg
My jc teachers all in their own world leh üòÇ some very chio some very old n naggy but generally all got mood swing,btohqsg
But my whole class gets it. Except me. But they don't understand my university books,btohqsg
at least can stay awake and pay attention,btohqsg
Cannot understand the notes oh. And during my time syllabus was new so we didnt have books to refer to. We were the first batch that experienced h1 2 3 system,btohqsg
mood swing is all teachers tbh,btohqsg
I learnt linear algebra using a 1950s book. But very good,btohqsg
TF you did this and no cambridge,btohqsg
Way past A levels for sure,btohqsg
Lol ok but my impression of the whichever jc ure from is alr quite notorious. It can make u transfer jc.. wow,btohqsg
Damn you did the whole thing?,btohqsg
Can meh. No uh. Kena sacked ok. Big news leh. Or is it i am surrounded by noseyparkers n gossipmongers,btohqsg
I thought the discipline master can cane boys?,btohqsg
Idl my jc frm the start becus it seemed like they were milking my money at first,btohqsg
I dun think is rjc. I am guessing like sajc/cjc/srjc cos these r the more garang schools,btohqsg
that one can for like offenses if i'm not wrong. but simply hitting students for like talking in class etc is not allowed. last time used to be able to,btohqsg
why you think he garang üòÇ,btohqsg
That is only if parents are informed and the boys commit some disciplinary offense I think,btohqsg
I got milked alm 200 in the first month,btohqsg
My current book. Slowly learning it again,btohqsg
Hahahhahaha yes tpjc eye opener üòÜ i got shocked by many things happening around me including cohortmates,btohqsg
You dont have donation draw in your AC meh,btohqsg
I meant for Govt funded JCs,btohqsg
Ac got a lot of donations rite,btohqsg
Hahahhahah what sch u from wor. Why so well behaved one. My sch culture quite indecent. Can fight with cjc üò£,btohqsg
dats why got so many stuff,btohqsg
govt jc where got pool sia,btohqsg
Lol good inference. But i doubt so too? Hci ppl r well behaved. They wont bully,btohqsg
ur phone has the ToF sensor,btohqsg
Good read  for axiomatic set theory,btohqsg
I don't think any point for me to say Sec School/before,btohqsg
he a bit wild ngl lol,btohqsg
Bring back the how many JC students does it take to change a lightbulb please,btohqsg
what course if i may ask?,btohqsg
Yes but hated it. Half hearted to do the questions,btohqsg
shuddap we had eight guys to one girl ratio,btohqsg
No other major would read books like that,btohqsg
Ya foreign student chio n rich n naive mah. Lecturer dated her to hotel. As in made her drunk.,btohqsg
i heard frm my senior in my school that her friend did some nsfw stuff with her bf in cjc,btohqsg
Something along the lines of depth sensor,btohqsg
CS is the boom right now,btohqsg
can u do quik maffswhats 2+2,btohqsg
Physics never use such rigorous math,btohqsg
The lecturer hit on females on normal days but only the naive one gets baited,btohqsg
Wao now I'm interested. Specifically the 'rich' part,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt physics have non Euclidean geometry and stuff,btohqsg
Nono  nothing‚Äôs wrong. Am just very impressed by his floorball skills üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
you technically can specialise in the maths of phys,btohqsg
And one of the millennium problems is a physics question,btohqsg
Everything else can be locally Euclidean,btohqsg
CIS a lot of hot people,btohqsg
Big math comes more from Standard Model + extensions I think,btohqsg
got some asian girl there look like some future kpop star,btohqsg
Huh... i seriously wonder which jc u in. I mean we got our books too but those books is last minute put tgt authored by some sch teachers n only came out in year 2.  I dun even understand tf what thet saying inside the book. Added on to my confusion know,btohqsg
TBH more of a physically important PDE question,btohqsg

Ur harbird or wadever will have a lot,btohqsg
Because my brain works differently in understanding mathematics.,btohqsg
Good leh all these boring subjects but with interesting lecturer,btohqsg
Huh but my sec sch teacher not like that lei. They seem way more experienced n professional than my jc lecturers. My jc levturers got a lot of newbie teachers. Some even got stage fright n scared of students one leh üòÇüòÇüòÇ the boys in my class liek to disturb those few teachers,btohqsg
why u sec 5 so smart,btohqsg
even if harbird I study engineering. So only got kukubird,btohqsg
Like my jc 1 chem tutor also noob noob one,btohqsg
only interesting lecturer i had had 60k unread emails,btohqsg
My jc 2 maths tutor also like scared of crowd,btohqsg
Then when u reservist u know more than the regulars,btohqsg
I just playing along with private smith,btohqsg
Oh... ic .. wa. Must donate money one uh. Is it top jc,btohqsg

I quite traumatised to hear so many things about my cohortmates tbh. They too garang lah,btohqsg
10 min walk go jurong liao,btohqsg
Then they say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know?‚Äù,btohqsg
I wonder if they strategically located the mrt exit,btohqsg
What???! The well behaved sch? Ok maybe times hv changed,btohqsg
oh u not talking about eunoia,btohqsg
I heard about the famous staircase,btohqsg
Heard about what yall do behind the bleachers,btohqsg

Ya i tot fixed price üòÇ,btohqsg
But u my age maybe ? Lol?,btohqsg
Ya it was popular joke in 2004/5/6,btohqsg
Unfortunately controllers can‚Äôt turn back time,btohqsg
Idk her üòÖnever kept in touch tooBut poor girl haix,btohqsg
shld i study amath or physics now,btohqsg
I meant the staircase in the school compound,btohqsg
Treat it like a timed practice,btohqsg
So do wadever u really want to get better at first,btohqsg
no time i need to sleep earlier tdy,btohqsg
if covid cancels your real exam,btohqsg
Nothing but Idrc abt her besides her looks,btohqsg
in every human subject is time management,btohqsg
but despite the speed i cant finish,btohqsg
i did hist prelims today so yea i feel it,btohqsg
That means you too smart alr cos you have too much to write,btohqsg
Usually i have a bit of spare time,btohqsg
i didnt do 2a para 2 because idk how to do and not worth it,btohqsg
i forgot abt the other point so yea,btohqsg
i only talked abt how it emboldened as 1 factor,btohqsg
tbh maybe i just lucky ba bc i spotted the seq topic,btohqsg
i thought my school behind time,btohqsg
But then they having prelims today,btohqsg
That means they killed the j2s,btohqsg
because i kinda like korean war,btohqsg
Oh for history i don't study the blue book,btohqsg
Cos the qn either orange book or blue book,btohqsg
but that means u have to be super duper confident in ur sec 3 work eh,btohqsg
ltr o level do oopsies then how,btohqsg
I even went to popular the other day to confirm,btohqsg
Ever since 2015 they changed the syllabus to this,btohqsg
I checked the Elective history tys,btohqsg
Yeah and my teacher told me cold war is harder cos more content,btohqsg
Plus I'm more familiar with sec 3 work so why not,btohqsg
so i can only do sbq for korean war and cmc,btohqsg
my prelim seq was on germany ww1 outbreak & defeat,btohqsg
For SBQ only need some slight contextual knowledge here and there,btohqsg
That's a good topic to score,btohqsg
1 was appeasement why it failed and then 2 is hitler‚Äôs mistake is the main reason why germany lost in ww2,btohqsg
q3 was berlin blockade for a and then cmc for b which i didnt bother looking at it,btohqsg
i looked at the cold war and i was like nope,btohqsg
What did ur teachers tell u to focus on for hist?,btohqsg
Yea for o level I'm not even gonna consider doing blue textbook topic questions,btohqsg
Just revise orange book until I'm super familar,btohqsg
Either orange textbook or blue textbook,btohqsg
not worth revising blue book when you cant do well in it,btohqsg
its just wasting time in it,btohqsg
I mean topic. My teacher said kw shd be first priority,btohqsg
Then if you're revising orange textbook content then read up a bit on bluebook,btohqsg
Just incase sbq is blue book,btohqsg
kw cmc for sbq no need study tho,btohqsg
u can kinda get some content knowledge and then pump it in,btohqsg
like soviet union defo will be ruthless,btohqsg
how do yall do this kind of q ah,btohqsg
‚Äúwhich source is more trustworthy in its account about the origins of korean war? eya‚Äù,btohqsg
Contextual knowledge and evidence from source,btohqsg
isit 2 iee and then 1 x-refer,btohqsg
I've never come across this phrasing,btohqsg
it came out for my prelims,btohqsg
i did 2 iee and then x-referred lolll,btohqsg
"""Since it is reliable  it is trustworthy""",btohqsg
I mean trustworthy is a synonym or reliable,btohqsg
can just immediately say trustworthy i suppose,btohqsg
"My teacher say must do ""It is thus reliable  not biased and useful""",btohqsg
usefulness than u do that wat,btohqsg
tbh i alw never do critical analysis for source based qn,btohqsg
i throw it away bc i cant finish,btohqsg
Idk I just do that for everything in case,btohqsg
and i kinda suck at it,btohqsg
How many prelim papers do u have left?,btohqsg
I thot most schools finished before,btohqsg
at most i know i screwed up ss,btohqsg
I only have econs and physics mcq left,btohqsg
actually lets be fair i found pofma pretty understandable,btohqsg
legit made my head toss & turn,btohqsg
Manipulation of information to socially control the population and to incentivise them to follow the govt,btohqsg
there was like a 5th estate news printed on a conveyor,btohqsg
then govt body threw it into the fake news bin,btohqsg
Honestly I think I'm screwed for humanities,btohqsg
i find humans boring in general,btohqsg
whether u have talent in it,btohqsg
Same but humans seems to take up less effort idk,btohqsg
if u dont have talent in it u prob cant score,btohqsg
i spent alot of my time on hist and i only got a meh 33/50,btohqsg
Honestly  my scores fluctuate a lot for humans,btohqsg
for yall its p satisfactory la but,btohqsg
for myself i have high expectations that time,btohqsg
U can say this about every subject,btohqsg
I whacked hist I got 90+ percent. I studied hard I got 60 lpl,btohqsg
now my expectations be like üìâüìâüìâüìâüìâ,btohqsg
So fluctuates a lot for me,btohqsg
its rlly hard to get A for comb humans tho,btohqsg
no matter how hard i put in effort,btohqsg
Idk I cant tell how well I do after a paper. I literally felt so scared I asked my ss teacher whether I failed,btohqsg
i hate it when they test the decontextualised issue,btohqsg
and then they expect us to try and understand the sources and do,btohqsg
i cant understand it super duper fast,btohqsg
i need to like buy time to highlight and shit,btohqsg
Honestly just remember the formats prob food enough. Half of the time idk what I'm writing,btohqsg
i learn & rmb the formats by heart,btohqsg
I learn them on the day itself cus the day before the exam I rushing to memorize,btohqsg
ok byeess imma study my chem alr,btohqsg
and i think imma die for chem,btohqsg
I gave up on prelims already lol,btohqsg
Amath god I felt like sleeping the entire way through,btohqsg
Actually can. You see all the politicians from the military.,btohqsg
TBH OCS CDO better than man or spec,btohqsg
because the toughest part of commando course they are in OCS,btohqsg
and OCS is much more lepak than commando course,btohqsg
Of course if you are a normal rifleman you gonna find OCS hard lol,btohqsg
Do you know how long is ur study break?,btohqsg
I think mine is from 3rd I'm not too sure,btohqsg
Hope so. Faster this is done  faster this shitty year is finished,btohqsg
Although I doublt 2021 would be much better,btohqsg
Hope they will just email us the results or something next year,btohqsg
Sorry mine is from 1st apparently,btohqsg
my bday is on the last day of sch for us üò≠,btohqsg
just search how many days to 19 oct,btohqsg

I studied only blue I graduated,btohqsg
Imo orange easier cos I'm more familiar,btohqsg
people may think im sec 4 now,btohqsg
I don't feel like studying hitler and the japanese in war so lol,btohqsg
isnt that the interesting part of history,btohqsg
why got say humans is talent,btohqsg
humans like sci is prac makes perfect,btohqsg
like sci  if u no interest  u wont do well,btohqsg
If u don‚Äôt manage to do something  just blame it on being talentless,btohqsg
i thought humans was a talent thing when i was younger,btohqsg
then i realised its really not,btohqsg
its just taking interest in the subj and learning exam techniques,btohqsg
Not really. Some geniuses came up with a lot of very complex stuff. It could be an invention or some concept.Life is not about exams.,btohqsg
Some people are what is known as 'intellectually disabled' and most cannot do A levels for example,btohqsg
lol im literally talking about exams rn,btohqsg
why are you diverting into something unrelated,btohqsg
the guy i was replying to was talking about o levels,btohqsg
Because I don't know what you meant intially?,btohqsg
Ask u to chill  not saying u cant talk,btohqsg
How to cram e math a math english combined science in 50days,btohqsg
You can study all in each day,btohqsg
can jump by 2-3 grades one,btohqsg
i jumped by 5 grades doing 15 sets of tys,btohqsg
You‚Äôre ok right? Can handle.. why seems like you‚Äôre in panic mode,btohqsg
im just saying im nt taking Os this year in case people want to ask my revision schedule,btohqsg
spamming tys may not be that good of an idea if you don't know your content,btohqsg
Hi all I was hoping that someone could share how MT in JC is likeAre lessons/exams similar to Sec Sch?What are the materials from Sec Sch that we should keep for JC?:D,btohqsg
H1 MT is basically the same thing as secondary school,btohqsg
Whatever u need they‚Äôll give u,btohqsg
Applies to JC in general too,btohqsg
Yes this. Just catch up with every lesson will do. H1 chinese is very easy to get A actually,btohqsg
did most people pass math for prelims in jc? asking the seniors!,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs just say that the prelims median for my batch was 50,btohqsg
i got b4 for olevel cl and d for alevel pls explain,btohqsg
I also dropped from A1 to C,btohqsg
I went to USS the night before H1 MT,btohqsg
imo its like studying sec sch hcl lol,btohqsg
Math easiest H2 subj to pass,btohqsg
but if ur sch al lthe ppl,btohqsg
But the internal rates are probably much lower,btohqsg
The person was asking about prelims,btohqsg
why is my com batt suddenly draining so quickly,btohqsg
50% passes for math in a‚Äôs?,btohqsg
‚ÄúEasiest H2 to pass‚Äù is bad?,btohqsg
yall dont need to do essays,btohqsg
if yall get it can score alr,btohqsg
if u memorise and can just whack definition word by word everyth u can score full marks,btohqsg
If I only write correct words in my lit essay then I will get full marks,btohqsg
that one is cant study lol,btohqsg
even if uk the book or content inside out,btohqsg
udk how to write an essay,btohqsg
Learning how to write an essay is still studying,btohqsg
abit hard to u come to jc first time,btohqsg
boom boom a for stuff like that,btohqsg
I went to Sentosa the day before HMT,btohqsg
What can I eat at np after 930pm,btohqsg
H1 chinese got A  oral got distinction - not just me but my whole class girls did,btohqsg
And we were all very shocked,btohqsg
And didnt really know how we got that,btohqsg
In the very first place  H1 MT exam will take place at the end of year 1 - thats when most of us are still in play mode,btohqsg
Most of us dun actually know what to prepare or expect.. we just anyhow go n sit for the paper to get done n over with,btohqsg
Esp knowing that we cn always retake if the grades r not good and/or that grade need not be taken into consideration for university entry,btohqsg
So bottomline is we blur blur go n sit for the paper blur blur come out and got As,btohqsg
Sounds like those ads that be like: achieve $1mil with this secret method  bankers hate him,btohqsg
Any tips to score A1 for mathematics and A maths? I keep on getting a B4 for sch exams,btohqsg
As with any other subject  review your work,btohqsg
As u collect more mistakes  u collect more lessons to learn from the mistakes  and the probability of making a mistake reduces,btohqsg
What kind of questions do u always lose marks?,btohqsg
To make 1 mil just gamble with 99 mil lul ez,btohqsg
