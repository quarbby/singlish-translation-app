rv is damn near where i live sia,btohqsg
do yall hav any idea which gender was harmed,btohqsg
what im wondering is whether killed means,btohqsg
I think the article is all we have now,btohqsg
i heard in the st ig comment section that it's not knife but axe that the student brought,btohqsg
how tf u get an axe tbh,btohqsg

2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine in my face,btohqsg
i will gladly open my mouth,btohqsg
straits times never rlly said anything,btohqsg
Don't spread any unconfirmed rumours here please,btohqsg
I mean killed may mean accidental/collateral death as well,btohqsg
Unless it was intentional murder or human imposed  then thats another story,btohqsg
Thats why no point spreading rumours lor,btohqsg
if it was accidental he wouldn‚Äôt have brought a knife,btohqsg
Anyone from river valley high is okay?,btohqsg
that student might have orchestrated it,btohqsg
but again this is my speculation,btohqsg
rvhs is both not jst sec tho,btohqsg
everybody just stay safe...avoid people i guess ü§®ü§®,btohqsg
Yes be a shut in uwu,btohqsg
the police is still investigating so dun rly know what happened,btohqsg
Can't imagine what it's like to be an RV student right now,btohqsg
our sch rep was alr bad enuf,btohqsg
Do u think rv still gonna have sch tmr?,btohqsg
what do yall think the suspect will get,btohqsg
Feels abit weird to have rite,btohqsg
Might be correction order and be placed under monitor,btohqsg
That time ITE also like that,btohqsg
But that was on the director,btohqsg
Next day still have to go back sch,btohqsg
Their sentence will be detained at president pleasure,btohqsg
@NyandaKunI accidentally tap ur profile pic n I saw my brother in ur pic,btohqsg
but def gonna have a big impact on this students future employment,btohqsg
Do you think the attack (not murder but just the attack) be justified?,btohqsg
u might get life sentence or death penalty depends,btohqsg
hard to say unless the news tells us the full details of what happened,btohqsg
I thought relocated to boys/girls home?,btohqsg
it doesnt really matter of age,btohqsg
No. They will still go to jail,btohqsg
Never expected the drills to ever come in handy,btohqsg
drills? i only know fire drill,btohqsg
This must be inappropriate but if only they announced HBL yesterday,btohqsg
They‚Äôll probably go into long term HBL now,btohqsg
but how would that help?? wouldnt studentsdevelop the fear of going to physical school,btohqsg
Yea abit unreasonable since no one can predict but I srsly doubt rv student want to go back sch anytime soon,btohqsg
just that the rules are strict everyone just stays in their own bubble,btohqsg
Sg just have very very low probability,btohqsg
if thr is witness  then the person develop ptsd how,btohqsg
Free counselling for any victims bah,btohqsg
Id even remember whether this has ever happened b4,btohqsg
Will be roll out espeically in the school body ah,btohqsg
Now being in grps and being alone not safe,btohqsg
i think this is the first time someone has ever done a murder in sch,btohqsg
and i think if the perpetrator kena caught,btohqsg
Now they gonna start screening for knives,btohqsg
he probably wouldn‚Äôt see places again,btohqsg
coz its very obv its planned,btohqsg
This year might be actually be shittier than the last,btohqsg
apparently my grandma told me that the student who passed away is a sec 1,btohqsg
^heard it from someone whos child attends rv,btohqsg
Yes best thing to do rn,btohqsg
how do you even avoid such situations though,btohqsg
Sg is still relatively safer than many other countries,btohqsg
But it's getting progressively less safe,btohqsg
Can be argued  but in any case  we are at the level of security of not experiencing a major case for several years alr,btohqsg
which is why when such occurrence do happen it's so shocking and we are not prepared,btohqsg
Dont have the mood to continue lessons anymore,btohqsg
Hence we should really settle down soon nonetheless and let those involved in the case handle wtv info to be disseminated,btohqsg
or be a big baller and leave the school,btohqsg
Take 2nd dose and pon sch,btohqsg
U think they going announce HBL today?,btohqsg
