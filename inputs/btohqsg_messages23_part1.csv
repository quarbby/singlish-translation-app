Hi  may i know which hdb home fire insurance covers for most expenses caused by PMD charging from neighbours unit?,btohqsg
Most do. Not under fire insurance but under home insurance,btohqsg
Thanks. I dont know my neighbours yet. Just planning to get an insurance as more and more people are owning pmd in hdb now.,btohqsg
Hi anyone do db cabinet? Can intro carpentry?,btohqsg
Can try JS Carpentry  not affiliated with them but read some good reviews online. DYODD,btohqsg
They only do big items lol,btohqsg
Hi  if we miss our flat booking appointment date  how long do we have to be able to go to HDB again to select a unit? or is it considered an immediate forfeit of flat selection?,btohqsg
How can miss out the flat selection omg. Need to call hdb ASAP to see if can appeal to make another appointment for u,btohqsg
Cannot miss one.Already hdb put if u can't make it go authorized someone,btohqsg
Ballot number out of supply but remaining units is like 20+,btohqsg
If u think u see the unit available not to your preference then no need attend already,btohqsg
Need to check if your project under the new rules that is within supply never go select flat banned for 1yr,btohqsg
My ballot number is out of supply. I'm just hoping that I will be left with less than 10 units to select by the time my ballot number is called. At least the non-selection count is waived.,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you write in to them to appeal for a waiver?,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm planning to do that. Not sure if they would reply in time as I want to apply for the June BTO launch.,btohqsg
They are many existing products. I have been using wifi webcam for years .. some of them using cloud storage some use local SD card . Most of them have all the common features like human detection alerts . Remote alerts and communication from receiver to callers .. now the most powerful should be face recognition which only available in china ..what type of features are unique from the products are you looking for ?   Sorry not sure if message is allowed in this room ? :),btohqsg
Texted him. He wanted some payment lol. I banned him,btohqsg
Advise to really considering well and think it through before cancelled since already paid the downpayment which is alot,btohqsg
But of course  if your decision is to cancel then no choice.,btohqsg
Downpayment sure burn  one . U go appeal for stamp duty refund,btohqsg
I don't know what happened to u but my friend give up also for his ex gf. So downpayment sure gone plus grant to pay back cpf.,btohqsg
35K grant is hdb give u  they will take back  u pay interest. This one u check w hdb first .,btohqsg
This is a good info u can read,btohqsg
Not sure if need to check how this will affect your new application next timeLike  whether you guys will still be regarded as first timers or second timers etcI remember coming across a couple during my flat selection  quarrelled in HDB office because the wife was a second timer and affected their loan or something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
Could also be the wife or both persons didn't know that second timer would affect their loan tooAnd maybe they were also relying on the loan to finance the flat and thus the fuss,btohqsg
You can try asking the person who askedü§î,btohqsg
Short of 2 words is itDon't - rush to - get married,btohqsg
Take things slow in relationship before being engaged or date longer before going official - basically know each other more first~ Don‚Äôt sign downpayment agreement then fianc√© fianc√©e break up‚Ä¶.this crap hurts big time financially  emotionally  socially if your social circles already know everyone plus sign wedding packages  gathering bridal team to start prep-ing,btohqsg
Not sure whether it will help if waiting time for BTO can be much shorterLike  enter the married phase properly without having to wait 4 years (because of the housing) after the couple decides to settle down together,btohqsg
Fat and ugly and short are not much of problemBeing poor can be,btohqsg
This really hurts‚Ä¶..so really hope no couple need this form ever‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs say bye bye to X amount of years together + whatever cost paid for the BTO thus far + whatever you guys had in the relationship,btohqsg
Old okay lahMinimally  be not poor,btohqsg
Have to pay back additional 5% of BTO price to HDB? üò±Thought only forfeit option fee + deposit + stamp duty  and return grant money + interests,btohqsg
Oh no la my scheme still was 5%  now is whatever the total amount of downpayment you paid thus far,btohqsg
Edited for clarity and generally cause public platform so yeah,btohqsg
Stamp duty if you gotten a HDB loan  HDB may try to get back from IRAS but not 100% guaranteed‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
