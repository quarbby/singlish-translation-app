i unironically watched crime watch every week until like p6,btohqsg
i still watch it if i have the time,btohqsg
"That one is OG Crime ""drama""",btohqsg
but now i laugh at it,btohqsg
although they say its true events,btohqsg

@cupcakkesnatchedmywigwait lemme send you my own dirty remix,btohqsg
then memorising the wrong version. embarrassing fr the onces be kicking u out,btohqsg
im. gg back to the og version song,btohqsg
This Cupcakke I heard before.. One of the American Youtubers pranked students in the library with her song..,btohqsg
I have a very cursed version of shut down,btohqsg
You can use this: Pocoyo es parte de mi vida.,btohqsg
Unlike cupcakke   pocoyo represents darkness  atrocities  lies   manipulation   greed,btohqsg
While cupcakke is abt wisdom  teachings  arts and holiness,btohqsg
I mean look at this   look at how the cult leader of pocoyo is spamming pocoyo’s but   a 4 year old’s part   how obscene  how inappropriate  how evil. The pocoyo cult must be stopped at once,btohqsg
Join me   change ur name to cupcakke   and together   we can take a part in stopping a force of evil   together   we can save humanities by listening to cupcakke remixes,btohqsg
Together   we can be pure and always be,btohqsg
Honestly my friends did mention that in the future i may become some corrupt politician-,btohqsg
No  i have no interest in acting,btohqsg
SAME YO everyone says ill become a politician,btohqsg
my sec sch days will haunt me,btohqsg
and you're not saying lyrics of majority or shall I say all cupcakke songs are inappropriate. second of all  as much as I am the cult leader  if you count  pocoyo is actually older than us 💀 lastly  pocoyo is cute and part of everyone's loving childhood while cupcakke is destroy young ones childhood by including inappropriate language and behaviour in the songs  hence #pocoyocult,btohqsg
lmao  as much as it's a cult  yours is more unholy if you were to think about it 😂😂,btohqsg
explicit lyrics with pocoyo hell nah,btohqsg
I should have dropped out of poa,btohqsg
we educate  appreacite relationships  and create friendships  we learn to be courageous  in pocoyo we Stan,btohqsg
Oh yeah for the last part cupcakke songs are age-related   hence proving ur point invalid,btohqsg
Cuz mcq is like in 9 days and i just want to take a break,btohqsg
U ever seen a 7 year old use Spotify,btohqsg
sorry  pocoyo is family friendly in all media  sorry cupcakke still losing,btohqsg
Omg not hmt   i do not need those trauma,btohqsg
bring smiles with innocence  not evil.,btohqsg
today i saw a 7/8 yr old using TIKTOK.,btohqsg

2 Options1. Double Pure Science (Physics + Chem) + Additional Mathematics2. Combined Science (Chem + Physics) + POA + Additional Mathematics,btohqsg
Its not a matter of whats better  it a matter of what are you looking to gain from the combi,btohqsg
i dont take POA so i cant say,btohqsg
i think it depends on whats ur interest,btohqsg
like if u think u enjoy sci alot then take double pure,btohqsg
idk what are the pre requisites for poa though,btohqsg
Depends on what u like but I'm pro doing pure sci unless UK u rly dc abt sci la,btohqsg
