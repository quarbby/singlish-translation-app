🚀Pika World Daily Updates- 12 Nov 2021🚀🧯Inflation hurting equity valuationWe are seeing a heighten level of volatility in the market. This was most pronounced on the Nasdaq which had a roller coaster ride and fell sharply on Wednesday  reflecting investors uneasiness with the sudden run in bond yields due to higher than expected CPI data. As we observe more closely  it is not surprising that the Nasdaq fell more violently than other indices.The old school narratives remain that if inflation does not ease  the Fed may have to taper faster and hike interest rate soon  detrimental to stocks' valuation. However  markets were digesting the louder inflation figure by sending the 2-year Treasury yield to hit 0.51%.💸Momentum building for higher ratesThere is now stronger confidence that with the firm core inflation figure  the odds of the Fed lifting the policy rate in 2022 is real. Some event expects three rate hikes of 0.25% each. While such a move helps to tame inflation  it may cause a spiral reduction in demand. After all  inflation itself may reduce household purchases and result in another round of fall in demand.We also observed how the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 1.56% during the trading session on Wednesday. This put pressure on tech stocks as their profits are many years down the street  and the long term bond yields reduce the value of these profits.🧰 A Political DimensionWith each successive higher inflation reading  it is now harder to sell the transitory story on the nature of Inflation. As CPI is pushing faster  the progressive reopening of the economy may suggest a possible spike in price pressure for consumers as supply chain disruption persists with input costs rising. More businesses are warming to the idea of raising the prices of their products and services.President Biden might have difficulty pushing for a larger social spending package despite watering down from $6 trillion to $2 trillion as worry on the sharp rise of inflation may soften support for more aggressive fiscal spending.Biden is not giving up. On the contrary  he conveyed that the infrastructure bill will reduce bottlenecks and thus lighten inflationary pressure.Nonetheless  among the Democrat party members  the call for a smaller package may become louder. After all  infrastructure bills can help improve productivity  but direct payment to households is almost a direct inflationary pressure on the economy.As numbers are running hot  anyone could best guess that the appetite for more spending dwindles. So  hopefully  Democrats can rush to the gate to complete the social spending bill before the mid-term election next year.📮What’s on the Menu today?At 11 pm  we will receive the JOLTs Job Openings  which we expect to drop slightly to 10.3M from 10.439M in the prior period.At the same time  the Michigan Consumer Expectations is likely to rise to 70.0 from 67.9.FOMC member Williams will be speaking at 1.10 am  and we hope to discover more clues on his perspective of the inflation outlook.It is 12 Nov  Friday  at 7.10 am in Singapore and 7.10 pm in New York. It was a week of disappointment  sweat  nervousness and relief. May friends of Pika World have a Wonderful weekend ahead!,btohqsg
