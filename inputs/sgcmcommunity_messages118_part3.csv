How do u gauge in order not to contribute your car paint to the wall,btohqsg
if turning right  if you feel that your right tyre is near the centre of the lane  you're good,btohqsg
if there is no barrier between up and down vehicles then make it ~1/3 of the lane from the wall,btohqsg
If u not confident install blind spot mirrors,btohqsg
the driver side is reversed but the theory is same... turn right = right tyre middle of ramp,btohqsg
rmb what your instructor teach you lol,btohqsg
Just crawl dont care driver behind,btohqsg
Just get high beam or horn only,btohqsg

If want 4 door just get lancer EX  the 2L manual is pointless if not a evo,btohqsg
Unless you wanna race like the fella who crashed on CTE,btohqsg
The koup is pretty good for short term drive,btohqsg
Oh didn‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs manual  not really interested in racing and also want to avoid tuned cars if possible. Have been seeing quite a few koups in my price range but just wonder if the 2 door will pose a problem. I guess it‚Äôs fine if only short term,btohqsg
every time after i crawled up  i was shaking all over,btohqsg
"From driver position I look across the front passenger  I align till the left mirror (Blue arrow) is ""touching"" the left wall if left spiral  at the same time you'll be able to see that your rear (car's  not yours üòÇ) gap with the wall. If spiral is right  then I align till my right wing mirror is ""touching"" the wall from driver view. It takes practice and is very accurate.",btohqsg
You try the city sq mall one  going up üòÇ,btohqsg
