got girl beside me squatting more than me jn,btohqsg
so i at 0 u at 292,btohqsg
Someone asked me about it and this dinosaur happened to have kept the article that was published in the chinese newspaper. RP for different schools back in 2001 when the max RP was 76,btohqsg
Bruh my friend idk keep telling me he breaking down wth,btohqsg
Im not a counsellor and i do hv my own problems to deal with,btohqsg
but if i am not wrong  their rp is calculated differently in the past,btohqsg
Yea but some ppl are easily swayed coz they didnt catch the vested interest,btohqsg
but on the bright side i can say my rp is higher than a raffles student rp in 2001. lol,btohqsg
20 + 20 + 20 (3 A level subjects  equiv to H2) + 8 (MTL) + 8 (GP),btohqsg
Tbf  ig it‚Äôs hard to detect vested and conflict of interests when the outlet doesn‚Äôt declare openly,btohqsg
U need to be against whatever their vested interest is to tell it out,btohqsg
"ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è MCCY announced that a new indoor arena will be built next to the S'pore Indoor Stadium to host more ""sophisticated events"".‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3Tp0IbUFollow us on@mothershipsg",btohqsg
Hmmmm I‚Äôm not sure what you mean actually but I don‚Äôt think being against all that is presented = critical thinking. To me  it is impt to be reading from various sources and also broadly before forming opinions,btohqsg
Ah so u admitted skill issue,btohqsg
but I didn't understand anything about rpno need to also when all As except for GP and I only wanted electrical engineering.,btohqsg
Wow u are exactly 18 years older than me,btohqsg
Lmao‚Ä¶i just wanted that straight As too,btohqsg
That is all i hoped for in jc  im accepting nothing less seriously,btohqsg
It is just A  B  C etc,btohqsg
3 A lvl subjects 60 pointsEnglish max 8Chinese max 8,btohqsg
I was hoping for AAA/A and GP C,btohqsg
I wonder how they converted the OA grades to regular a level grades during the change to the H1/H2 system,btohqsg
And i actually got what i hopef for,btohqsg
so i should be considered 71/76,btohqsg
Seriously in my mind i will idk what if i scored anything less,btohqsg
Like is it A1>A  A2>B  B3>C  B4>D  C5 and C6 E,btohqsg
A1 and A2 becomes AB3 and B4 becomes Blike that lor,btohqsg
Im pretty sure it is not this,btohqsg
Coz my parents got B4 for gp,btohqsg
ya  change to H1 content + proj work,btohqsg
Or maybe it‚Äôs not exactly that. Won‚Äôt ever know since moe doesn‚Äôt show,btohqsg
Could be like entirely new grade boundaries that don‚Äôt closely mirror the old one,btohqsg
I think it is like O lvl grade boundaries,btohqsg
Btw Jun wei what subjects do you offer tuition for?,btohqsg
I want elec engineering so score lower also nvm,btohqsg
myself primarily jc maths and physicsGot other tutors for chem and other levels. That's about it.,btohqsg
A1: 8; A2: 7; B3: 5; B4: 4; C5: 2; C6: 1,btohqsg
Maybe I should‚Äôve gone for your physics tuition last time,btohqsg
Do you teach group or private,btohqsg
oh  then I should be 69 points. Hit the average.,btohqsg
Means my mum can never compare her grades w us,btohqsg
My mum was complaining now gp is c,btohqsg
Last time need to get at least B,btohqsg
just lost my $30 earbuds this morning üò≠,btohqsg
Ye  I was 69 too. A1/C6 ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Let me count my parents grades,btohqsg
I didn't study GP that's why. Don't know where to start studying,btohqsg
GP is just whack and pray,btohqsg
I only study the day before A levels,btohqsg
I was asleep the full 2 years in GP lessons apart from when doing class tests,btohqsg
