The transaction show up in my Maybank cc as posted after 5 days. Usually only 2 days.I called up maybank cso why did the transaction posted only after 5 days. They replied that GE called for payment late. Thats why Maybank pay them late.I called up GE cso why GE call for payment so late. GE says  Maybank delay. GE received payment on the spot when I made payment on their eportal.In this situation  whose fault ? Anyone able to advise ?,btohqsg

Hi all  I am a little confuse with the UOB rising dragon promo. Can someone advise me if my plan is correct. Currently only have $5 in my UOB one accountStep 1 - Apply for a Stash Account on 27/01Step 2 - Participate in Rising Dragon 28/01Step 3 - Transfer $100k + $5 to Stash account on 1 FebStep 4 - Wait for 4 months until 1 June and withdraw the moneyIs that correct? Coz I saw the tnc mentioned fund will be earmarked until 17 June,btohqsg
It always depends on when the merchant (GE in your case) actually clears the payment. And usually most payments won't be cleared during the weekends/PH.,btohqsg
What does it mean by participating deposit date? Does it mean I can transfer the fund into uob account anytime within this period and earmark end date will be the same?,btohqsg
1. How much did you have on 30 Dec  1030pm?2. With the above amount  +100k to whichever account you registered with for earmarking.3. Earmarked monies will only be available AFTER the earmarked end date.4. Why don't just register for Jan period? The month haven't end.,btohqsg
1) $5 balance in UOB one acct on 30/122)  $100k to newly opened Stash account3) Understand there is 4 months earmark period4)  What does it mean by register for Jan period? Meaning register for Rising Dragon now? When do I need to transfer the fund in?,btohqsg
You sent the table in the previous message... It's pretty clear if you ask me ü§î,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it stated in the first column of the table,btohqsg
Thanks for your advise. What will happen if I transfer the fund in on 28/01 instead of 1/2? Any diff?,btohqsg
Your cash credit and earmarked date will be different lol,btohqsg
So you plan to register for Feb instead of Jan? LolIf you prefer to get the cash credit and unlock your monies 1 month later  no one's stopping you...,btohqsg
The quesrion is why?The rest is saying fatser sign up faster get earmark faster get credit why dragSign up on 28. 01 can top up by 28.01.,btohqsg
But why not put in your UOB One account instead? I assume you didn't earmark any monies there if you're asking these questions...A 5% EIR would be better than 3% EIR too.. and $5 fall below fee for UOB One account is more than then $2 fall below fee for UOB Stash account as well.. not sure if you're going to keep 1k into UOB One considering you've left it empty for almost a month already...,btohqsg
