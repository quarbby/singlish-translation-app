"Hi all i understand from the faq in cpf website that if the total mandatory CPF contributions (from employment) exceed the CPF Annual Limit in the calendar year  any excess voluntary top-ups to MA will be refunded without interest in the following year."" Below is the link to the FAQ in cpf website.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/top-up-your-cpf-accounts-to-build-your-savings/what-is-the-voluntary-top-up-limit-to-my-three-cpf-accountsSo am i right to say that if your annual income with bonus add up to $102k or more  u r not eligible for top up to medisave since the amount will be refunded with interest and the amount the top up will not be eligible for tax relief?",btohqsg
Hi all! If I am shopping at Fairprice physical store itself but pay through the Fairprice app  is it considered as online thus can use Citi rewards for 4mpd?,btohqsg
yeah miles is a selling point to consider  but for me i am personally using cashback only cards for now as my expenditure is low at 600$ per month just nice for UOB evol 40$ cashbackSo any overseas spend is usually using trust card   as i don't really spend alot overseas as well   like going malaysia etc,btohqsg
I think someone just asked this earlier maybe try scrolling up a little to find the answer,btohqsg
Overseas for cashback. I useamaze + Citi cashback for8% groceries6% diningAmaze + Maybank fnf for8% groceries8% 58128% pharmacy (beware mcc),btohqsg
Hi  if using Trust card for overseas withdrawal. Do I have to change it to debit card on app or can just do withdrawal under credit card account?,btohqsg

Hi everyone! Am intending to sign up for HSBC Revolution card and have a few big purchases in IKEA below $1k for the month  and am wondering if IKEA is part of the bonus points list? Tried Heymax  wasn't helpful.,btohqsg
Base on Heymax  What is ikea mcc code? Is the mcc code part of whitelist indicated in HSBC Revo TnC?,btohqsg
Shows as 5712  not within the list I'm seeing on the T&C. But wanted to confirm if my understanding of the  eligible transactions is correct and the MCC matters even if paying via payWave/contactless payment in IKEA?,btohqsg
yes  both payment method and MCC matters for revo,btohqsg
If not in the Revo whitelist  spending on IKEA using Revo means no 4mpd no matter what method you use to pay.If you want to earn 4mpd  Heymax already shows you which card can get 4mpd on Ikea.,btohqsg
Thank you both for the clarification  understood now :),btohqsg
good to know this  but even with your use case   it doesn't fit into my use case after looking up both the cards as both cards have minimum spend of 800$,btohqsg
Can I use the Instarem amaze card (tagged to uob lady‚Äôs card) for local SG spending to clock the 2k spending in 1 year?,btohqsg

For EGA  there is a MAB of $2 000. If not will charge u $5,btohqsg

Hahaha I went to check the app I thought I missed out on something but I also don't remember ZYM becoming a bank... Then I saw the other person name is ZYM,btohqsg
For their 3.5% promo  u need to maintain MAB $1 000 in order to receive interest. Interest is paid monthly  calculation method is daily. 2% additional interest is on incremental balance as compared to ending balance on July 31,btohqsg

For POEMS any idea what an immediate rejection of ‚Äòexceed client limit‚Äô means for a buy of approved ETF using CPF? OA over 20k and CPFIS account number is linked under bank info. CPF investment dashboard shows the amount within allowable limit.,btohqsg
You need to top-up cash. If cash is not enough  you cannot put order even with CPF/SRS,btohqsg
CIMB doesn't endorse MAB method..interest accrued daily upon the amount inside..then tally up on month endjust be mindful of your account balance ON THE LAST DAY of the month..u maintain that amount or be higher than the previous month's...,btohqsg
Hi  any idea if the same UOB account could be use for both Christmas Promo and CNY Promo (if there is one)?
