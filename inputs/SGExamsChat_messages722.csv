the only malls at that time were sunway plaza and another one near woodlands mrt,btohqsg
I wonder what you can use oaktree for,btohqsg
Does oakwood smell diff from other kinds of wood?,btohqsg
You seem pretty experienced in this field,btohqsg
and also the places that houses the shittiest and most garbage schools,btohqsg
at least yishun got a jc (definitely the best jc in sg),btohqsg
rude but fair i was from yi,btohqsg
no offense but their 90rp rate is so bad because hearsay the students there go to school and slack,btohqsg
its not like their notes are actually THAT bad,btohqsg
like im sure their teachers are willing to help to a certain extent,btohqsg
it all comes down to the students,btohqsg
guys at least yijc is not the only jc with a 0% 90rp rate from this year onwards,btohqsg
cjc arts might actually be the best stream of all time if staircase six never existed,btohqsg
have you tried sourcing out notes from other schools?,btohqsg
i dont do well with words,btohqsg
had to make my own for things to make sense,btohqsg
guys if sg had a new jc what would it be called and where should it be located,btohqsg
but maybe the notes were bad to me because i cant read it LOL,btohqsg
the kids in ubin also need to study bruh,btohqsg
is it bad because the notes explaining quality is bad,btohqsg
i didnt do good with jc cuz its too much memory work  only mod i could do well was maths partially and computing,btohqsg
or you just dont know what is going on,btohqsg
its so long ago i dont remember,btohqsg
at least nobody is shitting on my place,btohqsg
idk why sg government decided to build the lowest cop schools at north area,btohqsg
punggol got so much development areas,btohqsg
punggol people requesting for a new jc knowing very well it won't happen,btohqsg
i liked yishun cuz its so quiet but so noisy,btohqsg
punggol isn't a part of sg,btohqsg
punggol is a country by itself,btohqsg
students there go in and slack,btohqsg
depends if the people want to mug,btohqsg
my batch had a crap ton of muggers that did well  is the next batch that fucked it all up,btohqsg
but im pretty sure most of them dont,btohqsg
we went from a sch who is not that good but were studying,btohqsg
or else why are their grades so abhorrent,btohqsg
to a sch who had juniors who vaped and fucked in the toilets,btohqsg
maybe the people i was ard,btohqsg
but there were alot of people who did mug,btohqsg
but i cant focus so i just did my own thing,btohqsg
like i heard they got vaping case,btohqsg
im sure you are an outlier,btohqsg
my fren show me her vape b4,btohqsg
tbh  the bad is published alot,btohqsg
there are alot who were good,btohqsg
my other fren vape when we were walking b4 and there were KIDS NEARBY,btohqsg
we were at the field next to tamp mrt,btohqsg
DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE ACTLY A VAPE,btohqsg
like you never see any news about the computing batch,btohqsg
ive never seen anyone use a vape in my life,btohqsg
cuz we were busy having earlier exams so we stayed in our class doing our own thing,btohqsg
i know too many ppl who went to nus,btohqsg
lucky u. my sec sch class got ppl vape b4,btohqsg
oh in my sec sch nobody vaped as far as i knew,btohqsg
in class infront of the cher💀💀💀,btohqsg
the chem class had 19 diff combis,btohqsg
i know the both batches tbh,btohqsg
i heard you guys and nyjc offer crazy combis,btohqsg
yeah  even nyjc limited their combis cos of the patched loophole,btohqsg
but they offer everything else apart from that,btohqsg
but yea chem batch has fmaths too,btohqsg
💀💀💀. tbf the cher was a grandma liddat. THEY ASK HER WHETHER SHE WANTED TO JOIN THEM,btohqsg
and one of our kiddo was h2 maths h3 maths and fmaths iirc,btohqsg

"The north was a undeveloped area for a long time  with that..bound to be filled with ""experimental"" infrastructure that could only be trialed and tested over decades to prove their effectiveness",btohqsg
no wonder all the yishun/khatib ppl come to ac,btohqsg
phys + theatre studies and drama,btohqsg
they are not gangsters yk!! they are acs boys,btohqsg
the bad people are badshit bad,btohqsg

all the non gangsters in yishun are ac boys,btohqsg
yall have some weird ass combis with the weirdest ancroyms,btohqsg
i bet acjc has better mean and median rp rates over that,btohqsg
acjc cos easily have over mean 80 if they could just revamp every science department,btohqsg
pcmh - phys chem math hist,btohqsg
most people would take pcme or bcme thoughb - bio,btohqsg
how many times do i have to say this,btohqsg
the government/MOE doesnt choose the cop of schools,btohqsg
cop of schools are determined by POPULARITY,btohqsg
i only hear ppl taking bcmh,btohqsg
then coincidentally the schools are shit therefore people dont want,btohqsg
but ac also has a few pcmh ppl,btohqsg
if one day YIJC becomes very popularIt is possible for YIJC COP to drop to raw 2,btohqsg
when i find a gf then yes,btohqsg
their mean median rp is horrible,btohqsg
hypothetical situations-like my chances of getting A for gp,btohqsg

wise words by #1 carbon footprinter,btohqsg

Like far too eccentric for me,btohqsg
It’s 20 kg what do you expect lol,btohqsg
Can't u idk give cold shoulder,btohqsg
I’ve been there before it’s not that crowded in the mornings so it’s a plus,btohqsg
My rbf is pretty scary too,btohqsg
Sooo that's a plus for me,btohqsg
And at least you can deadlift there,btohqsg
Wait what r u talking about,btohqsg
Unless you’re referring to 15 kg max dumbbells,btohqsg
I’d rather use 10 or 15 so it gives the illusion I’m lifting multiple plates😁,btohqsg
How am I supposed to respond,btohqsg
I mean as long as you'd frown,btohqsg
I'm sure you'll look scary enough,btohqsg
no i meant the shoulder press,btohqsg
Ya la the person existence buay tahan is it,btohqsg
I wont go and mess with her if she doesn't aggro me first,btohqsg
My Oni advice is do the very very bare min to make your day to day life ok,btohqsg
But if she wants to play then i'll entertain her,btohqsg
man don't u have btr things to do than give her attention tho,btohqsg
ofc in the end u do u,btohqsg
sometimes other ppls decisions directly affect you,btohqsg
Lol I rmbr seeing this years ago,btohqsg
I think I listened to more hours of Super Shy than all my lectures in 2024 combined,btohqsg
in 2023 I had like super shy on loop the entire year,btohqsg
oh yea bedok you know clara  been distant discord friends with her for a while now lol,btohqsg
yep  i think she knows me,btohqsg
lol I just realized there's 1 entire section of online lectures I totally forgot to do,btohqsg
ethos from tekki server is poly y2 now,btohqsg
he joined poly in 2023 no?,btohqsg
isn't he same age as tekki,btohqsg
bruh there are people who honestly dunno how to respond to mental health issues,btohqsg
my aunt just keep saying 'i just need to relax a bit',btohqsg
i hv exams next week and next next week and next next next week and so on how to relax,btohqsg
it doesnt help that things are making it worst,btohqsg
at the same time i dunno if i actually hv time to get help,btohqsg
she said if im stress about school i cant survive adulthood,btohqsg
it is more of im already idk burnt out...,btohqsg
idk what actually happened  i was ok in my last 3y but my mental health just took a turn for the worse in this final sem,btohqsg
ok not idk what happened but it started off when i was hving a physical issue after recovering from covid,btohqsg
he was sec 3 in 2021,btohqsg
kamslut graduated in 2022 sec 4,btohqsg
kamslut and ethos both should be same batch,btohqsg
i really dunno how imma survive this sem,btohqsg
i think it is many things going on at the same time that contributed to this deterioration,btohqsg
i tot i told u the backstory about how it started,btohqsg
idk why im feeling very demotivated suddenly,btohqsg
it is not possible...my only solution is to just tide through it for the next 8 weeks...,btohqsg
it is so stupid if im going to give up at the 3.5/4 mark,btohqsg
in terms of students no  in terms of adults idk,btohqsg
I rather be a sg student,btohqsg
if ur results are good u go where you want,btohqsg
conciously deciding you dont want to be happy is very different than actually being forced to become unhappy,btohqsg
ur results good but u not bumi,btohqsg
singapore is the former for most people  the rest of southeast asia is the latter,btohqsg
what if i say im forced to become unhappy,btohqsg
i think mental health issues is on the rise here actually,btohqsg
its a issue everywhere  not just singapore,btohqsg
there is no size fit all solution to mantain the happiness of a general population,btohqsg
tekong? mental issue? the MO says no such thing!,btohqsg
i feel that the education system is just too stressful over here,btohqsg
so that we can keep up with first world ambitions and visions,btohqsg
actually they have never really addressed the cause of mental health issue  rather they only talk to ppl who already hv mental health issues due to something,btohqsg
like it is a reactive approach rather than a proactive approach,btohqsg
and u think just by organizing talks can sort things out meh,btohqsg
really at the expense of mental health?,btohqsg
i think like the main issue boils down to a lack of resources & knowledge of mental health issues,btohqsg
Rich people kill themselves over lonelinesspoor people kill themselves over money,btohqsg
there is literally no one size fits all,btohqsg
i mean within asia most education systems are ultra competitive,btohqsg
india has its insane college entrance exams,btohqsg
SK has the annual college exam thingy,btohqsg
i hv broken down more times in 2024 than 2023,btohqsg
Singapore took a hard look into mental health from the 1990s to 2000s...sg started campaigning workers to find a singapore away from the coporate and working lifestyle..find the joys of what singapore could offer.we did that  the decade after saw a slowed down sense of progression as a country,btohqsg
i think there are many causes to depression and what not,btohqsg
i got a shock when i see depression med at home sia,btohqsg
turn out the doctor apparently gave it as a muscle relaxant,btohqsg
simps ultra hard for the female dxo,btohqsg
i took muscle relaxants for migraines,btohqsg
idk why dr gave it to me,btohqsg
no as in the dr gave a tca as muscle relaxant,btohqsg
i legit got a shock seeing antidepressants at home,btohqsg
coz i dunno who have depression,btohqsg
tbh idk if you shld pry,btohqsg
also awks to broach this kind of topics,btohqsg
unless uw do the boomer way,btohqsg
everyone is right to feel however they want regarding their mental health..but what is not right is subjecting mental healths for reasons to rest and relax at the expense of others,btohqsg
take photo post in family group chat,btohqsg
my mum got a shock that she taking antidepressants,btohqsg
actually idk how it goes but apparently it made her feel depressed after taking it???,btohqsg
like the action of the med became a side effect,btohqsg
sometimes meds have an opposite reaction,btohqsg
thats why for psych meds its a trial and error of what you take,btohqsg
i wish i wun reach that stage ah,btohqsg
ya the bumi thing damm fucked,btohqsg
speaking of which there was this asean scholar my sch didnt allow her to drop chinese then becoz of her chinese she cant go to her 'bonded' jc,btohqsg
why is this chat jumping from topic to topic,btohqsg
spend all the money to give scholarship,btohqsg
one one dentist studied here on jpm scholarship,btohqsg
then nvr went back to do her bond,btohqsg
Fuck I almost read jpm as jav,btohqsg
sister we are the stronger currency,btohqsg
it's 3.58 rm to 1 sgd,btohqsg
that green portion called SSRI is how anti depressant works,btohqsg
have u ever read his books,btohqsg
i tot u needa break at the moment,btohqsg
basically trying to paint malays as a disadvantaged race,btohqsg
i have a whole set of notes on it,btohqsg
not to you i guess just letting people know so they dont think taking more anti depressant works,btohqsg
they are the traditional natives of malaya LOL,btohqsg
its like how Americans are like,btohqsg
tbh it comes with a lot of side effects  hence more needs to be done to encourage better adherence,btohqsg
it is not really about over taking it,btohqsg
the UAE and msia were the same,btohqsg
in the 90s to early 2000s,btohqsg
u look at UAE and msia the diff,btohqsg
i mean the UAE has its issues,btohqsg
UAE as in united arab emirates,btohqsg
but in terms of growth the uae has done well,btohqsg
that when they do exercise overseas,btohqsg
the usaf thought that they have emergency,btohqsg
cuz their a/c spewing black smoke,btohqsg
then the USAF thought their engine dyinv,btohqsg
turns out its just shit / non existent maintenance,btohqsg
idt the data is even recoverable,btohqsg
the plan disappeared in 2013 i think,btohqsg
didn't the pilot of mh370 have affliation to a political candidate,btohqsg
or a passenger of mh370 had a affliation to a political candidate,btohqsg
has the profile of it too,btohqsg
Oh yea wasn't there some recent update about the missing boeing,btohqsg
but whoever hijacked it must have p good knowledge of how the plane works,btohqsg
cuz turning off transponder isn't something most ppl would know,btohqsg
and hiding from PSR is even harder,btohqsg
there was this reddit analysis made,btohqsg
i think even if anyone survives the initial crash,btohqsg
thats what happened to majority of the suvivors on JAL 123,btohqsg
i think what amazes so many ppl about mh370 is how 4 countries simultaneously failed to keep up with precudural checks on a unidentified aircraft in their area,btohqsg
most of your flying is tracked,btohqsg
until it reaches territorial airspace or approach,btohqsg
yk how big sg FIR is,btohqsg
its like alm impossible to track all the a/c flying in sg FIR,btohqsg
the first plane to find the debris was a us military aircraft..but the pilot relayed back that they thought everyone was dead based on the wreckage..the japanese military agreed with the US military that night and both returned at daylight the next day,btohqsg
i tried to fly but my head hit the ceiling and thereʼs a big bump on my head now,btohqsg
What your thoughts on the Gaza and Palestine incidents,btohqsg
dont need to think hundred and thousands of miles away..just look at our neighbours malaysia and indonesia,btohqsg
Malaysia allowed a terorrist to leave jail  in 2000. yazid hosted alqaeda operatives in his kl apt  in the meeting. they dicused bombings of several airliners over southeast asia. Two present in the meeting later became 9/11 hijackers.,btohqsg
I can’t believe he did that for the kid lol,btohqsg
adult that doesn’t realise they’re an adult now,btohqsg
Who would that even be.. the chair of your major or what the Dean? I didn't even know u could even meet the Dean lmao,btohqsg
Idk if he like diam diam for that with no emotion or if he does the distraction technique,btohqsg
That's my point the distraction technique rarely works one also tbh lmao,btohqsg
I remembered he moved into hall on the day of ori lmao,btohqsg
Many In USA Believed MH370 is invaded and held captive by aliens,btohqsg
imagine if you got the chance to take general paper in jc,btohqsg
i bet you would get A for it,btohqsg
@ admins please get rid of these bots thank you,btohqsg
I cant bring myself to school,btohqsg
I miss my y4 english teacher so much,btohqsg
The last time i had a good english teacher was in pri sch,btohqsg
There is uni principal? Not that i know of,btohqsg
Wth help!! Parents not letting u join cca is mentally exhausting? Then how did i survive jc,btohqsg
A smart idea is to get hold of a set of house keys,btohqsg
Not every major has got a very accessible head lol…but the uni itself has a head but i dun think they will even entertain parents,btohqsg
i mean the point is that at uni level they’re adults so parents quite literally have no jurisdiction anymore in deciding what they do (on and off campus),btohqsg
SG typically age is for it is 21 yrs old,btohqsg
though can hold guns and buy Toto / 4D at 18,btohqsg
My parents control me more than my brother,btohqsg
Let him loose in sec sch coz he was just 💀💀💀,btohqsg
But i kinda understand tho..like lets say putting it into her shoes right  it sometimes is hard to overrule ur parents,btohqsg
What is CSC? Double math is FM right,btohqsg
Yea it is like a pretty similar situation,btohqsg
Except that JC has principals and they probably will step in if parents are big balls enough,btohqsg
Correct! But they disappear after going PCC!,btohqsg
double math is prob fm special assessments cause for fm class their h2 math pacing is totally different from the rest of the h2 math batchso they have to learn the h2 math contents first before doing fmath  afaik the teacher there goes at a very diff (and fast) pace,btohqsg
i have 3 WAs in week 6 AMA,btohqsg
good news: 1 is take home,btohqsg
bad news: its history so standards prob higher,btohqsg
im learning how to code disease spread lol,btohqsg

tbh for arts subject right  ur school exams not really telling of ur actual A level standing,btohqsg
AITA for doxxing someone who made me mildly offended ?,btohqsg
tbh im happy to live in the MBT  MYE  Finals era,btohqsg
bruh if this is the case,btohqsg
recently i was thinking of a serial killer who murders everyone who slightly inconveniences them,btohqsg
someone has put such a huge toll on my mental health and got away with it coz i stupid,btohqsg
i do not have these thoughts at all,btohqsg
but doxxing is legit not something to go about it speaking from experience,btohqsg
it was dumb me coz my dad did warned me,btohqsg
there was a few weeks when i dun even want to go class but i need to,btohqsg
tldr i was facing issues after recovering from covid,btohqsg
i also dw to do damage since im the group's spokesperson,btohqsg
so i cant just have my friend to attend class himself,btohqsg
and it is gonna be my disadvantage to not go for tutorials so i just pulled through it,btohqsg
im LEGIT like siyan knows la,btohqsg
tho i did not even dox,btohqsg
idk wait for siyan to come and explain,btohqsg
oh kuro can do it too,btohqsg
My ta is likeWeek 3 econsWeek 5 mathsWeek 6 chem,btohqsg
Fuck up ta then fuck up ig,btohqsg
