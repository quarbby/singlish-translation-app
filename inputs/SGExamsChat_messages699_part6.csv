Like tbh I still dont understand how ppl can sudden complete the entire practical,btohqsg
Thats why gp also like majority of ppl dont write finish one,btohqsg
it is the same as prelim question,btohqsg
coz the school wanna help and choose same topic,btohqsg
Oh for us we dont get to choose,btohqsg
no not we choose  as in the school choses the practical topic,btohqsg
We are the 1h do 3 experiments vers,btohqsg
Ya  we dont get to choose,btohqsg
The sch doesnt choose for you,btohqsg
For a levels is standard for all jcs,btohqsg
Cus we are not under spa,btohqsg
This is your time to explain what is spa,btohqsg
Cus 2017 a level batch onwards no spa anymore,btohqsg
i remembered that last planning qns they say it is same as prelim then can just memorize out,btohqsg
unless the school didnt help la...,btohqsg
You still need to draw out the diagram and all,btohqsg
but it is almost entirely the same tho,btohqsg
Why your a levels damn weird weird one ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So we cannot choose the experiments uh,btohqsg
u mean we or the schools,btohqsg
The schs and us cannot choose,btohqsg
for like 10 years in 2006ish to 2016 there was this thing called school-based practical assessment (SPA),btohqsg
so your practical was spread across multiple tests by the school,btohqsg
but i was pretty sure my prelim's planning qns is the same as my A level planning qns and it was openly announced,btohqsg
either you misremember or your sch basically cheated...,btohqsg
huh cant be my school cheated leh,btohqsg
but i was pretty sure it was the same...like very similar,btohqsg
i mean if they legit openly announce the question is the same  it's illegal,btohqsg
bc it's standardised across the cohort,btohqsg
Yea they actually cannot do that eh,btohqsg
i cant remember where i heard from but i got to know,btohqsg
otherwise how can the reddit people every year complain about the same thing,btohqsg
Oh but speaking of cheating hor,btohqsg
oh yea wyatt yk my prof was part of MOE last time then he said they basically realised SPA was stupid from the start  but they had to wait for the guy that pushed for it to leave before they can say it's stupid and change it back,btohqsg
I actually had a yijc friend cheated for o levels cus invigilator was playing on his phone.,btohqsg
Plus he was like dyslexic so he was placed in the special case room,btohqsg
Idk i just sudden rmb but i know they did it quietly,btohqsg
Is it invigilator play phone or invigilator sleeping...idk,btohqsg
im very confused now regarding the practical shit,btohqsg
like damn telling you about it is lowk a bad idea,btohqsg
i remembered o lvls it was the same too sia,btohqsg
So the invigilator got reported lol,btohqsg
then did he get into trouble,btohqsg
i'll be a better invigilator for midterms,btohqsg
Cus our batch still have o level spa,btohqsg
A level spa is removed when we first enter jc,btohqsg
but only the planning qns was same,btohqsg
you can think of spa being kinda like pw where it's administered and graded by the sch,btohqsg
A levels  spa was removed in 2016 so for us no spa,btohqsg
then now it's just one paper graded by a separate body,btohqsg
