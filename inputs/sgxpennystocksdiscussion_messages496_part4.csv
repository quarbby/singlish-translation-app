For AEM  market already expected it will report lower 2Q21MayBank -  We expect 2Q21 to be sequentially stronger than 1Q21(PATMI: S13.2M) . At mid point of our 2Q21E PATMI $15mCMIB - In the short term  we expect AEMâ€™s 1H21F to be lower yoy (given record numbers in 1Q20 last year) with a strong recovery in 2H21F,btohqsg
