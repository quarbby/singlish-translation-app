Just say u JV can liao ðŸ™ƒ idk if that reason still valid tho,btohqsg
I mean when u gather thousands of people what u expect sia,btohqsg
Now NDP won't have such a problem liao,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone here with o level pure bio notes cuz the one in the library is kinda long and not apt for current syllabus. Thanks!,btohqsg
I didn't read up on the followup but I think all of them survived right? Like was anything even broken?,btohqsg
Wonder if any of those down pes or not,btohqsg
i feel so bad to the point i wanna die,btohqsg
ok body keep up this standard,btohqsg
later i get shit MO give LD lanjiao,btohqsg
U take hot water then make a hot pack,btohqsg
Eh NS covered under the Work Injury Compensation Act or not,btohqsg
No like it ain't even covered as it's NS for the WICA act.,btohqsg
There's probably some SAF equivalent for workplace injury compensation probably la but it sucks that WICA cannot cover,btohqsg
imagine ur ck RSI goes so bad ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But they have to be declared or found only in NS rite?,btohqsg
As i said la this method has the unintended side effec of working too well which when u hit 39C then it starts to be a problem,btohqsg
got something in my eye i cannot remove,btohqsg
and its the good eye ðŸ’€,btohqsg
gonna make it worse for RSI tmrw,btohqsg
i have an eye problem where my left eye cant move left and right at all,btohqsg
Bruh I ain't a lawyer but I am pretty sure that won't stand up in court in terms of liability :/,btohqsg
i went to specialist and he said by right i not supposed to be combat fit in the first place,btohqsg
now my NS is 1y10m so,btohqsg
Yeah I was gonna say that's not something that makes u combat fit,btohqsg
suppsoed to go for 2y but,btohqsg
The context of this clip makes your statement even better,btohqsg
Cuz 5 mins later the controls broke and he had to get Richard and James to make the RV stop,btohqsg
Cuz it ain't a law I suspect its probably just a SAF internal policy to be able to say that they protect against such injuries.,btohqsg
Basically you cannot even sue SAF in court cuz the law provides them immunity,btohqsg
Pray it ain't a slipped disc or smth,btohqsg
But either ways by your description if it's true it would be a chronic condition alr nonetheless,btohqsg
eh i need ask u sth,btohqsg
Classic reasoning the other is cuz u keep looking at your phone,btohqsg
Ok I don't mean to go on a tangent here but a stocks price has no indication as to the size of a company or its value,btohqsg
The more accurate measure would be market cap,btohqsg
Until u zoom out on the 5 year time frame,btohqsg
No my point was that ppl that bought in 2021 NVDA now only see a breakeven,btohqsg
2022 was a horrible year for stocks,btohqsg
Rn we don't even have the YTD performance yet and the year hasn't end yet,btohqsg
I am heavily weighted in banks and even then I am pretty much untouched tbh,btohqsg
The biggest burn I had was Credit Suisse,btohqsg
But at least I bought shares and not the idiots who bought the CET1 bonds,btohqsg
30 cents on the dollar cuz if not the Swiss executives are gonna have a fun time when the Saudi Arabians invite them for some fun.,btohqsg
But the most volatile stocks are a different sector.. makes me sick when ever I look at it,btohqsg
But one thing i learn abt stocks is dont expose your position until u sold,btohqsg
Or just keep your mouth shut,btohqsg
Coz cfm people gonna say shit one,btohqsg
It's the nature of Biotech stocks cuz of the phases of drug approval,btohqsg
