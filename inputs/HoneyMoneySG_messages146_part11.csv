Only for kids born in 2025 onwards right? Anyway..the idea of having kids is not purely encouraged for tax relief la  though it‚Äôs definitely a good to have,btohqsg
Hi i just want to ask what is a good card for physical spending to earn to most miles apart from the citi+amaze combo ?,btohqsg
Nope for kids born 1 Jan 2024 onwards.,btohqsg
Of course I didn't have kids for the tax relief....just saying it's stupid policy since they wan to encourage ppl to give birth yet take away the benefit for the working mother,btohqsg
Uob PPV: spending up to $1 110. No min spend.Uob VS: between 1k to 2k. Min spend 1k,btohqsg
Uob PPV:MOBILEpaywaveUob VS: paywave (can be tap card or tap phone),btohqsg
I don't think it is a matter of using it unless your plan is to put the money in your SA and use it to invest. I believe most people would not advise doing so. The key thing would be your intention. If both your medisave and SA are far from hitting the limit then I would think you can also choose to invest in either one.,btohqsg
Interest will be generated for both RA and CPF life.Interest for RA will be yours  while for CPF life will be in a centralised pool.,btohqsg
It's a taobao problem. They charge the MCC differently based on what you buy  and sometimes they may charge you differently even for the same item from the same shop.,btohqsg
"Not sure what you mean ""SA could be taken out after SA exceed FRS"". Before you reach 55  there's absolutely no way to touch SA other than to invest (which is one of the worst decisions  as there is nothing offered to beat SA'srisk free  fee free4% interest).The 2 strategies are mainly:1. RSTU first if you want to have a bit more tax relief opportunities from CPF top-ups (insignificant because there's still SRS)  as SA contributions (mandatory/interest) will stay in SA.2. VCMA first if you want to supercharge your SA or OA if SA have met FRS. Can be used for insurance premiums like Integrated Shield Plan (and rider) and CareShield Life (and supplementary plan).For more details can watch this video by Chris:https://youtu.be/CuXXX5F1cYE",btohqsg
When she gets the CPF life payout  you use the money to VC3A lor. No tax reliefs  not advisable.,btohqsg
I have seen recommendations for klook travel insurance. Don't think shopee is a good place for that haha.,btohqsg
Anyone withdraw cash overseas using trust card before?,btohqsg
Like in HK. Any fee charge?,btohqsg
Trust link yes. Trust cashback havent.,btohqsg
Make sure Trust Link card is linked to Savings Account and not Credit Card  then withdraw from Savings Account if the ATM asks.Fees depend on ATM  DYOR.,btohqsg
Like Melvin said. Fee will be from ATM  not trust link card itself.,btohqsg
Can help advise which dbs credit card good for Agoda n air ticket ? Cos will be using this card to pay other card bill,btohqsg
The dp I have for HK ATM free fee withdrawalHSBC ATMHang Seng ATMBOC ATM,btohqsg
Miles or cashback? Dbs women world master card is a good miles card for Agoda and air tix.,btohqsg
UOB Lady card is good card for miles,btohqsg
üôÉ Oops type too fast. Then DBS woman card is the one,btohqsg
Thanks u all.  I think DBS woman master requirements is high for min. Can't meet.,btohqsg
Quick qus  do I still earn the 5% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance if i were to say i transfer all of my OA to SA? Meaning now my OA is $0.,btohqsg
There is no min spend for that card thou?,btohqsg
Do you mean income requirement? They are not strict with the 80k annual income,btohqsg
Don't have. Just note the short expiry on the points. 1yr on the card itself,btohqsg
Ya. That is one reason I choose to go with UOB lady card to clock travel related transactions,btohqsg
Ah I mean after 55  once Ra is created and filled up with SA and OA (not touch if your SA is sufficient)  you could take the excess amount above FRS out.Hence at least I have a chance to take out funds from SA or at least it increases my monthly payouts.But medisave only could take out through outpatient medical bills/insurance premium or co-payment for love ones or yourself. In that sense  how probable could I actually use up medisave up till BHS if there is coverage from integrated plans.,btohqsg
The excess will go to OA at 55. You typically wouldn't really use up your MA  but excess MA interest will go into OA if SA have already met FRS.This overflowed interest that goes into OA can then be usednow(if OA is above $20k)  for HDB loan or investments (that can beat 3.5% p.a.).Either way it does not make a big difference  most will meet BHS eventually if they are actively topping up SA or MA.,btohqsg
"I feel like the true purpose here of VCMA should not be to aim at higher payouts. While true that u may not utilise the full BHS if nothing serious medically happens   BUT WHAT IF u fall very ill one day and need alot of coverage from MA?Just like u do not buy insurance hoping to ""cash out"" or earn from it. It's a backup should smth happen to u.",btohqsg
I mean personally if you are unable to utilise your medisave is a good thing. If you top up your SA now all the money are stuck there. If you do need it for medical purpose  you can't touch it. I am not too sure if you should aim for ers instead of frs at your age.,btohqsg
Hi experts Would like to seek your advice/ recommendation.Context:- Never top up CPF SA and MA before- Never open SRS account before- Want to get tax relief now- Just a single starting to buy a resale nowHow could I smartly get a tax relief and at the same time prepare/ build up for retirement?- Top up SA vs MA?- Open SRS account (flexibility to withdraw in case needed to use for housing costs such as Reno etc or just personal urgent needs?)Current sum:SA: 55kMA: 67KHave watched YouTube videos but still can‚Äôt decide the best way to do so.Thank you.,btohqsg
Your MA is 4500 from the max for this year. It depends on how many percent is your tax? 3.5% or 7%,btohqsg
Thank you all  I will try to apply   since no min spend. Alternative will be UOB lady. Merry Christmas to all.,btohqsg
I am no expert but I would probably top up medisave 4.5k and SA 3.5k. It also depends on how much is the chargeable income under the 7% band. Depending on your age which I assume likely to be less than 40  srs may not be the best option for you. Finally  I would think that one should only do top up to reduce tax if you have a lot of spare cash on hand as the savings are generally negligible.,btohqsg
Most importantly this are my personal view and not financial advice if it even falls under that category.,btohqsg
Thank you guys for your views! Appreciate loads!,btohqsg
Income this year is a unusually high for me at almost $100k but with CPF deduction  the chargeable income is at 80k so still in the 7% bracket.I‚Äôm looking at how I can start preparing for retirement and at the same time  get the tax relief. Feel that I‚Äôm so late in the game and feeling the anxiety.,btohqsg
Don't worry so much. Having high income is a good thing. I would gladly pay my taxes if my income is high. I started pretty late myself.,btohqsg
Latest Chris video on SRS is a hint for top up decision making as well. 100k then strive for 150k subsequent. Cheers!,btohqsg
Need to be mindful that srs can only be taken out currently from the age of 63 or is it 64?,btohqsg
63. But flexibility to withdraw (chargeable for 100% + 5% penalty) during urgent times,btohqsg
Since you're starting to buy a resale  you should calculate if you have enough cash for your renovations/loans repayment.It's better to pay the small income tax now than finding yourself having to pay the likely higher (as you'll be in a higher tax bracket) income tax + penalty fees when you withdraw it before the stipulated retirement age.,btohqsg
If you put money inside srs  you need to invest it. Why not invest it outside of srs?,btohqsg
Very true. All my money in my srs account I don't need it till retirement but I don't have much anyway.,btohqsg
Paiseh  I think cashback capped at $50 per calendar month. Another good point about this card is cashback is calculated based on transaction date,btohqsg
Oops yes $50. Updated the original message,btohqsg
