Compared to the past which is long gone. Haha,btohqsg
Thats very true. Well we cant live in the past. üò¢,btohqsg
Any thoughts on bonussaver vs uob one savings for 2025?,btohqsg
How much do you have? Like 50k  100k  150k etc,btohqsg
For lower range of saving like 50k  I think there is merit of bonus saver. UOB one shines when u get close to 150k,btohqsg
Are you able to fulfill UOB credit card spend of 500?,btohqsg
Hold on ah. I have some time so lemme check some info,btohqsg
Ok  bc i use bonussaver but then learned that a lot of their categories decreased,btohqsg
does anyone know if theres a way to download citibank statements as excel/csv?,btohqsg
Not really.. UOB One account with lowest tier (less than $30k) with $2k salary credit and $500 card spend is already better than SCB Bonus$aver  which you need to fulfill $3k salary credit...3% p.a. + good cashback/miles card vs 1.05% p.a. (honestly you throw into anywhere also better)And to increase to 2.05% p.a. you need to spend $1000 on their no rewards card...,btohqsg
Ya I noticed SC interest dropped to 2.85% pa,btohqsg
Where got 2.85% p.a.... the only good thing is if you are new to Bonus$aver account  can get $150 if maintain $20k upon account opening (or AirPods 4 if maintain $50k) and credit salary.,btohqsg
I would say avoid Bonus$aver at all cost... Never insure or invest with banks (if you're not a üê≥)...,btohqsg
Morning all- can I check if anyone has received the  Dec account statement for OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Hi  I've got a few big purchases coming up. Any recommendations on which credit cards to use  thanks,btohqsg
Should specify what types of purchase for mcc purpose and the amount.,btohqsg
Bed and furnitures - approx. 5-7k budgetCurenntly using Uob one for wedding expenses and citibank cashback+ for all other spend,btohqsg
last time i use atome for furniture at least can break into 3 payment to meet the card limit (1500) to get 4 mpd,btohqsg
i use DBS WWMC and HSBC Revo for atome,btohqsg
Hi guys  I applied for HSBC Live+ back in July  for the luggage reward sign up bonus  how am I supposed to claim it?,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm thinking of using both uob one cc and uob ladies cc. Uob ladies cc for just my dining expenses to earn me 6miles per dollar and Uob one cc for the rest of my expenses. Can I check is this method feasible  is the 500$ min spend for one acct interest a combination of both cards? Thanks,btohqsg
SCB Bonus Saver is dead since they cut their rates as at 1st Jan 2025.,btohqsg
Any good saving account banks nowadays. I'm using ocbc 360 feels not so good leh,btohqsg

A bit lower  but combine with earmarks promo is good,btohqsg
still have a jumpstart acc. not sure should i cancel it since next year i will pass the max age,btohqsg
Hi everyone  could you please advise on the best place to park a 50k fund?I‚Äôm open to taking some risk in exchange for higher returns.I‚Äôm currently considering the following options  but I‚Äôm unsure which offers the best interest rate at the moment:1. OCBC 3602. Fixed Deposit3. GXS Boost Pocket4. Chocolate Finance5. moomoo / Tiger MMF,btohqsg
These are mix of savings and investment accounts. Definitely investment accounts will give you higher return for higher risk. Do you require your capital to be protected?,btohqsg
Yes  I understand. There is no need to be capital guaranteed. But of course  I‚Äôm expecting a higher return if going for non-capital guaranteed investment. Let‚Äôs say capital guaranteed makes 3-3.5%  non-capital guaranteed makes 3.5-4%. If it‚Äôs just an extra 0.5%  I wouldn‚Äôt take the risk  because not really worth it.,btohqsg
Hi All  need some help. I hold few positions of CSPX Ireland domiciled etf on IBKR. Just curious to know  if I sell these positions is it tax free like US stocks or is it taxed for the capital gains? Pls help. Thx,btohqsg
Hi is the HSBC live+ promo here for new to bank or new cardholders or for existing cardholders?,btohqsg
If you can fulfill salary  save and spend criteria  can consider OCBC360. If want hassle free  can consider Choco Finance. That is my take,btohqsg
Yeah  it seems like not many alternatives nowadays.,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong it‚Äôs combined. But better check with CS again.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check on online transactions relating to Citi Rewards card? For MCC 5816 Digital goods (Games) done online  does it count for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all experts. Can I ask  which card is good for paying insurance premiums? Haha,btohqsg
Eh what perks can I get from using Maybank card to pay insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Maybank horizon  0.24 mpd.Maybank VI  1.2mpdWith maybank VI  spend above 3k  one limo ride,btohqsg
Has anyone transferred in stocks from 1 brokerage to another for the rewards? (I.e. tiger -> moo moo) Is it worth the effort and rewards!Please advise shifus! üôè,btohqsg
Eh any min requirements for Maybank VI? Haha,btohqsg
$150k income. This one quite strict,btohqsg
Wow but in summary  only Maybank cards can still earn points or air miles for paying insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Maybank Platinum Visa  3.33% cashback (tiered  insurance can only make 50% of spend  can use CardUp to make up for the other 50%),btohqsg
hello everyone  UOB one card payment to AXS dont qualify for the min $500 spend criteria?,btohqsg
Many thx for the info. So if my intention is to earn miles from my insurance premiums  the Platinum Visa is not the card to do for  correct?,btohqsg
So Maybank horizon would b the best choice for insurance premiums if I want to earn from insurance premiums? Or any card tat goes through Cardup can earn miles?,btohqsg
Cards like UOB PRVI  1.4mpd for Cardup,btohqsg
Use HSBC ega giro 1% rebate easier,btohqsg
Why just get 1% when you can get miles AND the 1%?,btohqsg
To me ega  just do one time then no need think so many,btohqsg
