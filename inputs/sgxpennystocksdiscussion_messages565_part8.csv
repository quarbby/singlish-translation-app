I bought this morning at 68 sold at 68.. lol,btohqsg
I see cannot break 70 also sell. Sian 1/2,btohqsg
not easy. market feels like weakening,btohqsg
I'm rather optimistic about it. Despite strong selling  hatten has managed the maintain at 68-ish. Hence their rejection to low prices is high and is indicative of rise.. just my view,btohqsg
Golden and GeO are more interesting for next few days,btohqsg
Agree. Can still keep if close 68/69.,btohqsg
Oceanusü¶™.. gd opportunity for those wish to üÖøÔ∏è short term 37/38,btohqsg
I encountered the strong throw this morning till 66 in just 2 min from 69/70 to 66/67.. so I decided to set my selling point at 68 again. Who knows just within 30 sec it sold off,btohqsg
