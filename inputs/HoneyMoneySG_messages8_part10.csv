Not sure about UOB One specifically. But atome qualifies as an online spend,btohqsg
Hi  Anybody experiencing revolut not able to use at mrt?,btohqsg
Not at all. It‚Äôs ok for me.,btohqsg
This month no more Revolut public transport rebate anymore?,btohqsg
https://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/publictransportpromoit says bank top up or card top up (except credit card) of $300. so Grab mastercard top up should count?,btohqsg
Oh nice they extended it again  thanks thanks  yesterday I see the original page they didn't mention it,btohqsg
Has anyone tried using Revolut to withdraw money overseas? How does it work  do I have to activate before I travel?,btohqsg

Hi guysI forgot.... are revolut transactions considered as online transactions?,btohqsg
Yes last month it was credited toward the evenings,btohqsg
this is terrible... I got UOB One purely for Cardup,btohqsg

Friz & Amaze just got nerfed,btohqsg
Not sure why  still not receive the US$100 worth of Apple from Webull although I met all the criteria.,btohqsg
Wow  so most local spender can unlink the masters card soon üòÇ,btohqsg
Still got reason to use it.. for Citibank 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh yes I just ordered my reward card also,btohqsg
Whats the next bank cashback? Cause it seems like miles will be the next best after UOB One,btohqsg
So they now did not reward any cashback?,btohqsg
Now my instarem card is useless.,btohqsg
Always have issue with instarem card transactions. They definitely chasing customer out.,btohqsg
The big deal on amaze was always on converting to online spend  and avoid fx fees. Once they remove these two  it's dead,btohqsg
Friz is dead before i even had a chance to talk about it,btohqsg
When did you complete 6 trades,btohqsg
My Webull datapoint:25 May completed 6 trades28 Jun AAPL shares credited,btohqsg

Should be in next week Tue/Wed,btohqsg
Can I know more about this and if this is considered good. Quite new,btohqsg
I think will need to ballot like the SSB Jun & Jul,btohqsg
DBS's FD is very fall behind SSB,btohqsg
Correct me if I'm wrong but UOB Absolute card does not count as credit card spend for One account right?,btohqsg
Had couple of issues with the revolut visa for public transport. Switched to mastercard and working fine,btohqsg

hi can i confirm that the dbs women card and instarem combo offline spend no longer earns 10x but still good for overseas spend?,btohqsg
Nope  just use Citi Rewards with it  excluding travel & hotel spend,btohqsg
Anyone experiencing ‚Äúpending‚Äù each time tapping for transport with Revolut Mastercard?,btohqsg
