Brokers’ take: UOBKH initiates coverage on RH PetroGas with ‘buy’https://ift.tt/S45HtqhApril 06  2023 at 12:20PM,btohqsg
They downgraded Rex at a low .. Howto trust their coverage ?,btohqsg
Really funny... these co have oil Wells and yet at very low valuation... probably should go list in other exchange...🤔😅,btohqsg
oil price up  UOB lower TP  means they want to collect for BB?,btohqsg
BB sell first then issue report,btohqsg
Use different method to calculate.?... hence target price revised down much lower...Can suka suka use different method... no mkt standard one...lol 😂,btohqsg
The revised target is now based on an asset-based valuation methodology  as UOBKH moves away from the discounted cash flow methodology that it traditionally uses to value similar companies. It is based on a 0.5 times price-to-book target multiple to reflect a mark-down in the company’s valuation  said UOB analysts in a report on Tuesday (Mar 21).,btohqsg
