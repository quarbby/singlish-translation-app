Hi   this is a social studies SRQb question  can I ask what are global solutions for cyber security threats ? I can’t seem to find anyone global ones for security   only for transnational terrorism,btohqsg
say yes individual have a more important role to play than global solution,btohqsg
Cause every problem starts from individual ?,btohqsg
I can say balanced can I,btohqsg
if u dont click on sus link,btohqsg
Just dont go to shady sites,btohqsg
But how the sus link get to individuals,btohqsg
You can have a solution only if you know what the problem is.One individual can make their own network secure by .....they can also not click on spam emails cause some might be able to disclose their emails or passwords to any third party.NEVER save your pws to websites  especially if you love to buy things online cause bank cake details still can be leak while doing transactions.,btohqsg
Ik internet security is one global solution,btohqsg
global can always be like having good  anti virus application to prevent having malwares,btohqsg
But technically individual efforts oni protect against noob level cyber threata,btohqsg
That’s why I think both is important,btohqsg
but I am more towards individual kek,btohqsg
It’s just the conclusion that’s diff,btohqsg
