Hi folks  after vcma 8k  any other ways to hit BHS?,btohqsg
if your annual cpf contribution less than 37740  can contribute up to this amount which will split between oa sa ma,btohqsg
this method no tax relief btw,btohqsg
actually i think  if your concern is not about tax relief and just want to achieve bhs  you can just topup to the limit within same year just that tax relief capped at 8k. this is my understanding,btohqsg
ok so:if your motive is for tax relief  8k is the max for yourself. you can either topup for family members another 8k or topup srs.if your motive is achieve bhs  you can do so no matter the shortfall just that relief capped at 8k.this should be correct,btohqsg
I should aim to max out my ma first or aim to get bhs in OA first?,btohqsg
Just for max out tax relief. Kind of no worth it if for the sake of max out go max out. Liquidity also must consider as might have some other opportunities such as investment in stocks etc.,btohqsg
Yep  roger that. I just saw  if annual limit of 37 740 is hit then the excess is refunded without interest. Question - what if I top up already  then plus the mandatory employers contribution exceeds the limit later on during the calendar year  then the refund go where?,btohqsg
your question is flawed as bhs means maxing out ma leh. oa can never be maxed out cos it gives the lowest interesy,btohqsg
Oh thanks I didn‚Äôt know thanks,btohqsg
yep bhs is basic healthcare sum so its only for medisave,btohqsg
So it means I should be doing ma follow by OA,btohqsg
whats your intention? the only way to topup oa is to do vc to all 3 accounts up to 37740 annually whereby 23% goes to oa if you are below 35. there is no way to topup to oa alone,btohqsg
unless you have a housing loan serviced by oa and you do voluntary housing refund which acts like a 'topup',btohqsg
I have a vauge impression that Chris once mentioned cashback cards are better than miles cards  not sure in which video  but does this still hold?,btohqsg
Not sure on which video. But I think it's mostly based on preference? For me I prefer cashback cause miles have an expiry date [ For a few cards],btohqsg
I did run polls but don't think i sided one camp over the other. It's really all up to your preference,btohqsg
Choose cards that suit ur lifestyle  not the other way round...,btohqsg

I have the 3% CDC card  better than nothing.,btohqsg
If I prepay my tax via axs  will my existing giro keep auto deducting?,btohqsg
No  giro will only deduct when you are behind payment due date,btohqsg
CDC Card able to earn rebate if pay via Cardup on IRAS or insurance?,btohqsg
thanks for the useful info. Just a question. to use cardup for IRAS tax payment  do we have to adjust the payment amount at the card up platform in July when the tax payment plan is usually revised to reflect the actual tax amount? and again in Apr the following year (due to the decimal difference)?,btohqsg
just to clarify  if we want to use the axs method for iras tax payment  we can still apply for monthly payment through giro first? but pay through axs monthly before the giro kicks in?,btohqsg
