There's grants to defray expenses also what,btohqsg
Got one for everyone if below certain income and u got decent grades,btohqsg
U didn't but why tho.. like she wanna pay the 20k per year arh,btohqsg
I am confused.. being a Malaysian in Singapore provides exactly 0 benefits,btohqsg
But once u are old enough I believe u are emancipated to make your own choices,btohqsg
actually y not u go back msia but live near border,btohqsg
And I believe when choosing between a 8.5k per year or 20k per year its definitely pretty obvious lol,btohqsg
Buy one lor it's like the price of a stamp like that,btohqsg
ok funds to build kuro a shelter  just a shelter,btohqsg
but if u don‚Äôt stay sg,btohqsg
DID THEY TAKE THE HOUSE AS WELL,btohqsg
Wait so that house now isit still furbished or left as is,btohqsg
Honestly it's better to convert to SC liao but then again once SC u gotta renounce your MY,btohqsg
Wait do and can you vote in Malaysia,btohqsg
Isn't your KL house technically a residence?,btohqsg
Oh bruh but u still end up having to pay taxes to Malaysia,btohqsg
I entered with 1 question on your citizenship and left with 10000 questions on why u choose this path,btohqsg
Exactly it's like being a second class citizen,btohqsg
And now in Singapore its literally just a hindrance.,btohqsg
guys this is not my real voice thanks,btohqsg
GUYS IM HALAL TF U ON BURETTE TAN,btohqsg
my feed is full of my friend ‚Äòs fav k idols,btohqsg
I think I deserve to be TikTok famous,btohqsg

@Voidchordsi left my vocation patch at home üíÄ,btohqsg
oh yeah today is chinese o level papers,btohqsg
lmao good luck to those sec 4 & 5s this year,btohqsg
Got into the worst course of NUS ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
She/he initially wrote atb s4 then I jokingly say whr s5,btohqsg
They have trouble finding jobs now,btohqsg
How is that the worse course.. also isn't ISS an unrestricted major?,btohqsg
So technically u got into NUS engineering which means u can still change majors,btohqsg
>_> bruh u in postgrad alr?,btohqsg
when I was rec  it was $240 per month :(,btohqsg
oh damn so the ns folks are earning more now,btohqsg
Many will gladly pay the buffed amount not to serve NS,btohqsg
I will glady pay double or triple that amount lol,btohqsg
It's funny how in the press release it's like eh we raise by 22 percent Ok but then it's like 600 now 700,btohqsg
that makes sense  I hiked my olympiad training fee by 17% after keeping it constant for 8 years,btohqsg
i heard nights out today or tmrw,btohqsg
Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight Nightlight,btohqsg
u still ORD after pay increase,btohqsg
i get a lot less extra,btohqsg
u wadio but i get paid more,btohqsg
I still got 1 year more,btohqsg
LCP is how much more compared to PTE,btohqsg
Ever play double it and give it to the next person? For the first 10-15 it's manageable then after that it rlly starts to make a difference.,btohqsg
For NS pay its like so low that literally doubling it is still not enough,btohqsg
almost useless but ill take it,btohqsg
Hey at least u don't have to pay 6k for tuition,btohqsg
Can I tong pang on yall? I wanna eat also,btohqsg
making full use of the ASA pay üòÅ,btohqsg
Hahahaha this is how ASA pays it forward,btohqsg
idk how tf they let this happen,btohqsg
what happened to cannot be measured in dollars and cents,btohqsg
There goes the pwn sinkie mentality. How long did that take ü§£,btohqsg
no la i nsf also bruh,btohqsg
i j wondering what made them wake tf up and be nice,btohqsg
Bruh then celebrate somewhat la at least its nice but we all know its not enough also,btohqsg
"In poly and uni be like "" just walk out bro nothing to ask one""",btohqsg
cb i gonna ord rdy den increase pay,btohqsg
Bet cfm got ppl complain nt enough,btohqsg
Just alot chang keng warriors complaining abt ns in general,btohqsg
If they give transport allowance den nt bad,btohqsg
If u stay in den give cash,btohqsg
Tbh they should just give NSFs concession fares,btohqsg
Bro not that lol u still pay adult fare,btohqsg
A promise is a commitment  a tall order and I must meet that tall order and its for you.. and its for you in the sense that 3 fingers are pointing back at me.. its for us.,btohqsg
And if the result is good thumbs up man! And if the result is lousy? BOOO!,btohqsg
My point was to just give student fares to Nsfs,btohqsg
Only concession worth is student concession,btohqsg
I think i got mine for $50? Bus and mrt concession,btohqsg
For stay out personnel give concession  for stay in personnel concession + transport fees,btohqsg
at least fair mah they weekday nvr go back,btohqsg
Den if they take leave or what got concession,btohqsg
Na bro they will probably say very administrative headache to do so,btohqsg
So just settle it once and for all and just give student fares,btohqsg
I think they scared at this rate everyone gonna ask for student rates,btohqsg
Coz now only uni students nvr get student rates,btohqsg
Last time poly student pay adult fare one,btohqsg
I might be on the minority camp here la but err I honestly think from a policy standpoint why not lol,btohqsg
Cuz Public Transport is a Merit Good just subsidise la,btohqsg
Only time i think concession is worthy,btohqsg
At that tho it might be better to buy concession pass,btohqsg
I don't exceed 20 bucks a month for my transportation,btohqsg
Cuz of the transit rule as well,btohqsg
Am I a uni kia or Poly Kia I also dk,btohqsg
Depends on the current cGPA if the B+ gonna tank the GPA then S/U,btohqsg
But tbh B+ won't be that bad from a cGPA standpoint,btohqsg
does ur fren think they can get A- or above for all remaining courses,btohqsg
yea kuro.. remember the time you calculate 116 B+ scores u more than 106 As,btohqsg
4pm Pioneer Mall Don't be late,btohqsg
Freaking NUS problems NTU be like you wanna take a gamble my friend?,btohqsg
idk how exactly the su system works tho,btohqsg
I think there's a cap on the amount of credits that u are allowed to have when u go to the next year,btohqsg
Either that or its needed cuz he needs to fulfil a minimum amount of AUs to progress,btohqsg
does that mean u shld only have at most X AUs left to do,btohqsg
also how does S/Uing a module affect this,btohqsg
do SU mods not count into AUs,btohqsg
They do but there's a cap to the amount u can SU,btohqsg
the 3 Bs add up to how many units,btohqsg
Yeah although what are the AUs of his B+ mod?,btohqsg
then cant he carry over the remaining 8 SUable units to y2,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the answer for the ÈòÖËØªÁêÜËß£‰∏Ä üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
again  depends on if he thinks if he can get A- or above for everything else,btohqsg
Usually as he progresses the rigour would get harder tho.. I think B+ is fine from a cGPA perspective so just keep the amount of S/U able credits first for another year,btohqsg
Bruh then just S/U if he can continue with a average A- grade -_-,btohqsg
why was the mothers hand red,btohqsg
no i thought it was c,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm planning to drop out from poly to enter JC.I did pretty well for o levels with net l1r5 of 6 last yr.Currently I'm in poly first semester and I'm looking at peer influence in poly vs jc  potential of definitely entering into university of my choice  as well as cost in long run from poly to uni and JC to uni as I want to get a degree.What do y'all think?,btohqsg
Also which JC do you wanna aim for?What stream and combi do u want?What uni course are u aiming for?What is your Combi for Os?,btohqsg
lmao fr yeah my poly first sem fees is like 1.5k,btohqsg
and im assuming that jc fees are much much cheaper (probably comparable to secondary school?) not sure.,btohqsg
Depends if he's aiming for Independent schools then that answer would be a no,btohqsg
independent schools as in like ri/hci? kind,btohqsg
Yeah those cost more than poly,btohqsg
its independent rather than government (aided) thats why,btohqsg
I thrive irregardless of the envt  even in poly I still make notes for every topic,btohqsg
Yeah but it's well worth tho if u can get in,btohqsg
like how private unis is more expensive than public unis,btohqsg
Na it ain't even private tbh it's just cuz of the breath and resources afforded to you at a independent school,btohqsg
Annual cost of independent JC is less than poly still?,btohqsg
true  looking at my sister's sec sch grades she can probably get in but ri/hci is very far from my home so she'll probably choose a jc that has a similar cop but nearer to my home,btohqsg
huh is it more or less,btohqsg
I never attended a independent school but it is more than Poly fees,btohqsg
I'm actually not sure about what courses are avail,btohqsg
Pros for poly:-if u know what u wanna do in uni  poly is a heads up for what is there to come- longer sem breaks in between meaning u can do whatever u want during holidays-if u are able to study consistently good and get high gpa  able to go straight to year 2 uni (only for limited courses)Cons- sch fees higher than jc-3 years instead of 2- need to mug every few months instead of just preparing for one A levels,btohqsg
The year 2 uni also need to put a caveat cuz those module exemptions mainly only for Engineering courses,btohqsg
Yeah RI and HCI is more,btohqsg
That's kinda why I feel like we need more info.. as to what the course is and what he's aiming for,btohqsg
But comparing to Poly it's more,btohqsg
So I am just using poly fees as a bench mark cuz he is asking that,btohqsg
And cannot go to other courses. Say if u study electrical engineering in poly  u can only go year 2 electrical engineering in uni  other majors need to start from year 1,btohqsg
Another point is for poly u are only comparing against your coursemates so bellcurve aint that bad,btohqsg
Ok that one also need to caveat not all polys use bellcurve for grading iykyk,btohqsg
President Halimah Yacob will not be running for a second term in upcoming electionhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/president-halimah-yacob-will-not-be-running-for-a-second-term-in-upcoming-election,btohqsg
the standard price is around 335 but I was under the impression that most of not all ppl have the edusave scholarship,btohqsg
Poly can apply for bursary tho,btohqsg
Exactly we are talking about raw cost,btohqsg
Can cover one sem worth of sch fees if u know how to cheat the system,btohqsg
Yeah 1k for bursary the rest PSEA,btohqsg
I know a guy getting outside bursary on top of poly bursary,btohqsg
wouldn't you be eligible for EESIS if you qualify for RI,btohqsg
But then again someone pays 6k so I cannot say la,btohqsg
Tbh cost savings at poly/jc level is kinda insignificant when u compare it to uni,btohqsg
that's the point tho save in poly/jc to afford uni üò≠,btohqsg
There's no such thing as save in poly/jc if u wanna get into big 3,btohqsg
JC mostly likely need tuition also while poly u work until u got white hair for above 3.5,btohqsg
The JC tuition industry is a massive industry lol especially if 4H2s plus GP u gotta be needing someone to help u cram the content,btohqsg
i would say it's a bonus bah  not a need,btohqsg
Yeah true its not a need.. but then again the industry is so massive for a reason,btohqsg
Eh thats just wrong and false for you to point to such an accusation,btohqsg
JC have to take or used to be u have go take subjects for contrastings,btohqsg
Which one would usually be weaker at,btohqsg
Limpeh took concurrently and stepped in both shoes and can tell u also,btohqsg
GP is still an issue for most especially the STEM combis,btohqsg
nah GP is just wack and pray,btohqsg
Idk but at least u get to ration your S/U allowance,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I did la but some ppl it's not intuitive for them or smth,btohqsg
but I do agree that schools don't do a very good job of teaching GP,btohqsg
Like GP and Humanities especially Econs is usually the most in demand subject for JC tuition,btohqsg
Basically the 3 most common tuition for JC is Maths  Econs and GP,btohqsg
not when u been getting cmi chers since sec1 üåö,btohqsg
Yeah it's legit a dice roll for teachers too that's why tution is such a massive industry,btohqsg
the most messed up thing is when the school cher recommend their own tuition to their own school students and then they teach way better during tuition time,btohqsg
In fact I think the classic route for MOE teachers still the same right? Usually is serve the 5 year bond then either climb MOE ladder or go be tuition teacher,btohqsg
Yeah I had  a teacher do the same in secondary school,btohqsg
Yeah but he never tell us what course he aiming for in uni,btohqsg
"""70rp can go med dent law"" moment",btohqsg
the reason why I'm not against tuition entirely is because I'm very aware that teachers especially outside of *those* JCs can be kinda susbut if L1R5 6 no tuition is fine,btohqsg
Huh? 70 RP? He's in poly rn.,btohqsg
It's probably fine.. but the As to Os jump is huge too so cannot assume,btohqsg
Ya la but rn OP in poly probably recommend em to stay until sem 1 ends,btohqsg
Then Sem 2 drop out wait for JAE next year,btohqsg
It's 3 months of your pay current,btohqsg
Not everyone can afford to think about the long run lol,btohqsg
Yeah I don't even have 1.5k in reserve,btohqsg
Simi long run the ah long find me in the long run liao,btohqsg
Liquidate at a loss? Hell no,btohqsg
Yes the loss is not a loss until u realise it,btohqsg
No la but if got 1.5k need then need to liquidate what,btohqsg
Reminds me of a friend that keeps like 15-20k in her savings account,btohqsg
Not even fixed deposit and I was so confused,btohqsg
The old boomer way of keeping money,btohqsg
Which is not wrong in the past when inflation nt so bad,btohqsg
Bro their era one meal at most 50 cents u keep 10k under ur bed can last u 10 years,btohqsg
Yeah the yields for T-bills is like 4.25 percent lol just put it in that,btohqsg
They dont care coz their time buying into all this very mafan,btohqsg
Only these few years trading start to be user friendly for us poor fks,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I said at minimum fixed deposit which takes 1 second,btohqsg
No one needs a 20k liquidity,btohqsg
Used to need to call stock broker den ask the price den confirm order kind,btohqsg
I still have to do that for some of the exchanges,btohqsg
Mostly is KOSDAQ that I have to do that,btohqsg
The awkward silence when u put in the order with a response 15 seconds later..It's been filled,btohqsg
Freaking Tbills gahmen guarantee sia even bank is up to 75k for SDIC,btohqsg
Both but if play save then just buy SG tbills at 4.25 yield,btohqsg
For US is FDIC is 500K if I remember correctly,btohqsg
US T-bills give like 7 or 8% yield but got fx risk,btohqsg
Guys anyone know where to get leather shoes? For banquet jobs,btohqsg

Since when ASA ever need to polish one,btohqsg
At least u got paid more on that day then in your month in NS,btohqsg

@silentvelocityWah some ppl mouth cnt shut up ah..,btohqsg
Congrats all NSFs on your slight increment,btohqsg
Happy for y‚Äôall  hope to see annual revision upwards,btohqsg
I think that given the inflation honestly not to give this small adjustment would be unreasonable,btohqsg
Plus I argue with a bunch of people why this is important then all say won‚Äôt happen,btohqsg
Then now come true  feels good to be right,btohqsg
So no one week block leave ah,btohqsg
Yo I just come here to congrats all the nsf,btohqsg
I feel like I played a part somehow by Cao bei in those public polls,btohqsg
Must raise more then can improve more :D,btohqsg
Mine that time voc training the day end next day morning report to new unit liao,btohqsg
So wed bookout pack stuff den thurs morn book in gedong,btohqsg
I got propose hypothetically that every NSF should be paid the theoretical minimum wage (I think 1.2+k),btohqsg
Guys i just realise how to get free products,btohqsg
Operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) will receive a S$1 600 monthly base pay by default for in-camp training,btohqsg
I think this is the target we should aim for for all NSF ba,btohqsg
No  all you need is to find a seller willing to do brushing for you,btohqsg
My unit give one day off for weekend gds,btohqsg
But is see heng suay one,btohqsg
Even nsman base pay set to this   should align in my opinion,btohqsg
As per gom is no such thing la,btohqsg
But css regular got heart one,btohqsg
"Brushing btw is a term that means someone is sending you items on the pretense of the ""confirm purchase"" button on ecommerce sites like amazon etc...to then be used to fake reviews on a more desirable product",btohqsg
One heart one mind one css,btohqsg
The no off rule they make it even during your unit ah,btohqsg
Like this the unit is doomed to have ops problems if the culture become jialat,btohqsg
With all due respect but if increase to 1.6k u see every polyclinic filled with nsf rso liao,btohqsg
Must give ppl benefit if not they will rebel,btohqsg
Basically they are sending you items  just so ecommerce sites get the confirmation that the item was sold and a review could be given,btohqsg
Aiya just ban RSO except in seriousness or book in/out la,btohqsg
U cant stop them from going A&E,btohqsg
that is the pay for most jobs in sg where they dont require a poly cert,btohqsg
Bro nowadays people have some of the weird ass reasons to keng,btohqsg
Those alr free so doesn‚Äôt change anything,btohqsg
And u increase to 1.6k people still gonna complain,btohqsg
Only alternative is to make saf pay so good ppl sign on willingly so can‚Äôt be helped,btohqsg
Dont forget free 3 meals per day  free bunk and free exercise regime,btohqsg
Now sign on also bohua coz of the saikang,btohqsg
Must raise salary lor  since defense so important government will solve it,btohqsg
Ur higher up gonna blame u for shit that is out of your control,btohqsg
Ur men fall down outside of camp injured cannot go for training  ur fault,btohqsg
Age is just a number bro,btohqsg
Why increase pay when the system is working well for so many years? Probably some general‚Äôs mentality,btohqsg
Should set pay to be like how the minsters set their pay.. the median pay of the top 10% of earners in SG,btohqsg
Then next time asked to do guard duty just say that ME7 say one Lor,btohqsg
Then ask ME7 why pay allowance at all lol,btohqsg
I wan be in P044 noe üíÄ,btohqsg
idm not having all the welfare,btohqsg
Ask the ME7 what he did to deserve his rank and pay lol,btohqsg
this feel so fked up with all the welfare tbh,btohqsg
Make me damn pissed off to hear this sia,btohqsg
