Taiwan‚Äôs healthcare better  good quality and almost free.. but end up  ppl will misuse them. Kena scratch also go A&E  to end up who pay? Tax payers loh..,btohqsg
Long term gains only good if the bets are correct... Is it really safe to let some parties retain power for so long?,btohqsg
Safer than getting divided focused on short term gains.Today  SG is losing traction in being a trade and aviation hub. How are we going to diversify? If we are fixated on short term  we will never address these issues; 10 years down the road  SG will no longer have the edge.I understand your perspective  and I really do. But I also think we don‚Äôt have much of a choice.,btohqsg
If any CEO of any company only looks at short term gains  would you invest in them?,btohqsg
Why not? Different investors have different aims and agendas,btohqsg
I don't see any bad points in exploring other options  other than the ones sold now. Not saying they are bad  just wondering if there are some other angles worth looking into. This also ensures check and balances  where no individual entities can profit unfairly from national initiatives,btohqsg
Investors only have one aim - earn money. If the company doesn‚Äôt have a promising future  it won‚Äôt be attractive. It‚Äôs simple as that‚Ä¶ but sure  there‚Äôll be some uninformed bunch that will invest them.,btohqsg
You already said short term would be good... And longer term can do structured short  right?,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. This is flaw in SG governance. And that is echo chamber and blind spots. But democratic like TW may mean that we lose the agility coming up with policies and laws..,btohqsg
True also... Got good and bad... SG's tried and tested way has been here for 50+ years... Aren't you curious how other ways would fair if tried?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to spam this channel on politics  so I‚Äôll just say one last point:If this idea of ‚Äúpure democracy‚Äù is that good and perfect  why isn‚Äôt it adopted in MNCs? Why can‚Äôt the janitor vote for the CEO?,btohqsg
The way I see it  all neighboring countries around SG are growing faster than SG  and will eventually catch up... And people here don't even have a tangible opportunity to questions any strategies put in place... Is this the case of being too trustful  don't rock the boat mentality or just cannot be bothered?,btohqsg
I understand and agree there is no perfect way. I'm just not convinced yet the proposed 'shove it into your throat' way is the 'best' way.,btohqsg
I learnt from COVID  to keep trialling and testing  and evolving for best survival chance. Delta is it's most successful form now  and it is not stopping,btohqsg
See specialist for cancer also 30 Baht,btohqsg
Their doctors mostly local thais. Makes me wonder why must SG import so many doctors.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt they just open up more intake for the medical school‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Make it so competitive for local,btohqsg
But then in the end still import,btohqsg
Power sia the one do the digging,btohqsg
SG have a lot like this,btohqsg
If all dig out maybe will collapse,btohqsg
Good ah.. really waste time to be doctor in Sg,btohqsg
6 years training  come out to be abused by hospital,btohqsg
Haiz bopian cant afford go overseas,btohqsg
Now got family or single ?,btohqsg
Dont get why need to consider gp during sorting criteria leh,btohqsg
If single go find job overseas,btohqsg
Best time to go is now,btohqsg
Less international competition if you get what I mean,btohqsg
"imagine  queue long hours at the polyclinic  exposing yourself to Covid  only to get treated by a ""temp registered"" doc from an unrecognised school.",btohqsg
Let's see by next year June 2022,btohqsg
My degree not competitive. See ba. Last time was prepared go india for job,btohqsg
I thinking if got any adjacent fields for you to go to or not,btohqsg
I strongly encourage this. Go see the world and then reflect your new perspective onto SG,btohqsg
Last time try pharma go take glp gmp courses cannot get,btohqsg
How to do this ? Apply overseas?,btohqsg
Search APAC roles   filter out SG,btohqsg
Nvm now try my luck a bit,btohqsg
all the while intakes to local uni medical schools are kept small on purpose. Kind of defeats the quality argument with unrecognised uni docs in system.,btohqsg
I wonder if you can... Get into pharma companies now or not,btohqsg
What's the point... Local don't put you first,btohqsg
Lols last time i apply 6 mth plus in advance. End of the day get job le  they then come find me for interview,btohqsg
Get in touch with the countries' recruiters directly,btohqsg
Always for big companies.. need to wait 3-6 month,btohqsg
Yeah somemore must have connections in company then have netter chance,btohqsg
Or apply for international transfer if your current company has this option,btohqsg
Grass might not always b greener over ther . Pros n cons,btohqsg
The only green grass here is the low tax pls,btohqsg
Current one i dont like cuz in paint industry,btohqsg
Very true. Should go experience it yourself for a first hand comparison,btohqsg
So trying find new company while holding this position 1st,btohqsg
If u compare to those places with famine  natural disaster   u wil knw cherish wat u have now though not all perfect,btohqsg
There is no perfect place or job  just need to try until you get one closest to your preferences,btohqsg
Why want to compare with shittier places,btohqsg
Singapore IPO  drop a lot.. lower than 2018,btohqsg
You want move overseas of course you choose better prospects right,btohqsg
To appreciate the better ones that would come later,btohqsg
Singapore ipo not very vibrant for a while le,btohqsg
Only the rich can afford to appreciate,btohqsg
There is a stagnation cost too,btohqsg
Anyway if worst come to worst i will try the global foundry job when they open plant here next year,btohqsg
Try apply for US side ah. They opening a lot of chip plants now,btohqsg

Everyday chicken rice  how you know you don't like curry  kimchi or potatoes more?,btohqsg
Be brave and take the first step  and never need to look back!,btohqsg
Cannot help it leh i dont like my current job. Prospect also no good. This year close factory downsize le. I think 5 year later they leave singapore,btohqsg
Worse case  just come back and eat chicken rice forever,btohqsg
TSMC & Sony tie up build chip plant in Japan,btohqsg
The worst is... Never attempt to live the life you always wanted,btohqsg
This is SG. Production is looked down,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. I only rmb global foundry opening here in sg,btohqsg

That time i apply qc chemist,btohqsg
Ois   FYI I from Exxon my job clean pump strainer think now not much people want to do,btohqsg

I think it is a good chance to get bigger market share mah. They have solar in their grid but they still charge higher than non-solar oem despite higher oil price,btohqsg
Any opportunity travel to other sister plant?,btohqsg
Of cuz this is just my layman thinking,btohqsg

The problem is many local educated sg doctor don't want work as polyclinic  doctor,btohqsg
A&e department also shunned by local sg edu doctors,btohqsg
Many want to specialise and become oncologists  eye doctors   cardiologists etc,btohqsg
So how to solve this shortage of local sg educated doctors in polyclinic and community level? Import from overseas ...,btohqsg
Auditors question ability of Raffles Education to continue operatingOctober 10  2021 7:52 PMOnce a star on SGX  REC has been pounded by negative news flows and poor market conditions.Read more:https://bit.ly/3FB8g2n,btohqsg
But the non-specialists have to be house officers in these jobs for a year right?,btohqsg
Increase the intake for the local medical schools. There are more than enough A‚Äôlevel students with top grades that qualify.,btohqsg
If can choose. Everybody also want to be officer. Nobody wants to be Sgt. So learn from Saf lor,btohqsg
Will that solve the problem?The local sg med school grad will still not want to work in polyclinic and a&e ... they prefer to go for atas specialisation such as oncologist   cardiologist  ophthalmologist etc..,btohqsg
Yes. As part of their bond ...Once their bond over... most leave to go to the atas specialties,btohqsg
It is easy to complain and kpkb about the problem..  but to find a good solution... it is not so easy,btohqsg
So there is no merit to the coffeshop theory that local medical and law school quotas are artificially kept low because most opposition politicians happen to be either lawyers or doctors?,btohqsg
I agree. So can give the opposition a chance to try their proposals??,btohqsg
dont know if it is linked to politics or otherwise,btohqsg
"aiya... its like ""Every school is a good school"" govt say but few believe",btohqsg
"""every doctor is a good doctor""",btohqsg
