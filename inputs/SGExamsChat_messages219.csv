if it is any consolation  it is only 2 years,btohqsg
My teachers said something like you dont really need to use a lot of atas words,btohqsg
Using it is good but if they cant find fault in your grammar then you can get an A,btohqsg
atas word doesn't mean much esp if u use it wrongly,btohqsg
Especially the more prestigious university ones,btohqsg
there are scholarships which do not require this I sourced for it; but your grades have to be really really really damn good,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not really interested in those,btohqsg
Those are mostly from NUS or UK-based if I‚Äôm not mistaken,btohqsg
then asking abt this is kinda misleading,btohqsg
anyone can send me template for job resume,btohqsg
There‚Äôs one at MySkillsFuture (login via SingPass) where they automatically include stuff like GCE exam  and any WSQ courses u took (eg if u work in FnB  chances are you‚Äôd have taken the food hygiene course; this will be included as well),btohqsg
With the increasing stress faced by students nowadays  mental health is an increasingly important issue that we must acknowledge. Many of us can definitely relate to the times when we are incredibly frustrated with the numerous commitments we have to deal with in academics  CCA  and our social lives. However  how many of us are aware of the ways to cope?This is what our Student Welfare team is focused on ‚Äî improving mental wellness in our student community. The team is dedicated to providing support to students by holding mental health awareness initiatives  in order to help them better cope with their struggles.The team welcomes any budding students who are passionate in leading and planning related projects!#WhySGExamsBe part of Student Welfare  and join the SGExams committee today!

I‚Äôm honestly not sure but i saw the job from gumtree,btohqsg
idk if I should clarify or just not go for the part time job since it‚Äôs $15/h,btohqsg
guys if I need to submit documents and I need my education certs can I use my o level results slip instead of the o level cert since I lost my cert,btohqsg
only difference is one has my bio F9(results) the other(cert) dont have lol,btohqsg
Should be fine as long as all results of the subjects u took are shown on the results slip,btohqsg
So if i enlist on 5th,btohqsg
O W A D I OWADIO,btohqsg
5 + 14 unless you enlist on weekends or got holidays,btohqsg
I will bkout in a friday,btohqsg
Nus merit scholarship is it given by faculty or course,btohqsg
but if you were to transfer from one faculty to another (eg. from Faculty A to B) in the following year after receiving the scholarship from faculty A  the scholarship will follow you to faculty B,btohqsg
Are there numbers on how many scholarships FOC gives vs 90rp applicants,btohqsg
I dont know its short form,btohqsg
SoC actually has the most scholarships given out,btohqsg
but combined with other faculties in NUS  its about 300+ total every year,btohqsg
Do they have a cap? Or do they just give as much as they want,btohqsg
12k students per year for a levels,btohqsg
Around how many students get 90rp?,btohqsg
the 300+ ppl accepted is for nus merit  global merit  nus-asean and STEM scholarship,btohqsg
prob 1-1.5k ish students every yr,btohqsg
Did you go through the nus ms interview?,btohqsg
i know most ppl have to go through an interview though,btohqsg
What were your non academic credentials im curious,btohqsg
do you know abt poly getting offered without interview?,btohqsg
and to be honest  i heard none,btohqsg
but confirm got nus merit scholars from poly,btohqsg
I heard somewhere that nus gms actually doesnt allow poly students to get it,btohqsg
but not a lot  like shiny pokemon,btohqsg
my interactions with other scholars from other faculties were all JC ppl,btohqsg
any idea how many gms scholars there are?,btohqsg
i didnt meet any poly ppl,btohqsg
if u apply with gpa 4.0 high chance get tbh,btohqsg
I very slightly lower than 4.0,btohqsg
Do you know if the interview was solo or gtoup,btohqsg
I don't want go nus though,btohqsg
is either nie  ntu or smu,btohqsg
but the s/u system in ntu sucks,btohqsg
90rp will they auto offer interview or got chance have nothing?,btohqsg
wait but how big is the difference between gms and ms other than prestige,btohqsg
cos the money wise it looked about the same to me,btohqsg
If im not wrong overseas trips youre fully covered i thinj,btohqsg
accommodation allowance and overseas semester allowance for gms,btohqsg
just these above 2 extra benefits,btohqsg
There was one student from my sch last year she got the gms,btohqsg
I dont know which faculty though,btohqsg
they get allowance if they stay in NUS  and they get paid during overseas semester,btohqsg
nus what's the research programme called ah?,btohqsg
hmm for ms also got allowance rite or did i trip,btohqsg
She was the pres of my cca but im j1 this year so i didnt meet her at all,btohqsg
thats why i only stated 2 points,btohqsg
and those are the 2 differences only,btohqsg
allowance if they stay in nus?,btohqsg
ya like if u stay in hall/RC,btohqsg
nus merit if u stay in hall/RC  no allowance,btohqsg
on top of the 6000 ah,btohqsg
if u ask me  NTU scholarship benefits more enticing,btohqsg
but NUS academic system for S/U is better,btohqsg
I compared nus ms and ntu usp usp seems worse,btohqsg
but better of a crap singapore education is still crap,btohqsg
thats why i didnt choose ntu,btohqsg
hardest to do well on bell curve,btohqsg
how common is nus ms in law ah do u hv any idea,btohqsg
but if u work hard  shld be ok,btohqsg
nus ms in law is rare,btohqsg
and i want a scholarship to fund my broke ass if possible,btohqsg
my NS friend in law is an NUS scholar  but not MS,btohqsg
in the very far future lol,btohqsg
Theres like an interview into law itself right?,btohqsg
he end up getting some future leaders award,btohqsg
like for law they judge ms and law admission tgt,btohqsg
Oh wait jay you have to do some via thing every year right,btohqsg
I think i read something like rhat in the requirements,btohqsg
Its either collect x hours or make your own via with other scholars,btohqsg
u group up with other scholars to brainstorm on a community service project,btohqsg
and carry it out for a period of time,btohqsg
Whats the difference between that and via? Just the name or,btohqsg
every1 has to do this now instead of via,btohqsg
via i guess is u just attend/volunteer for an event u want and earn CIP hrs,btohqsg
this is like project work irl,btohqsg
Are there people who got 90rp but almost 0 portfolio and got soc ms?,btohqsg
Cause right now my portfolio is looking empty unless i get a decent score at noi,btohqsg
Hello. Just wanna ask if anyone have access to the blue CLT paper for O Level?,btohqsg
i guess is possible? But provided your personal statement in the application and CCA portfolio is decent (at least you have done some stuff as a CCA member (no need to be exco)),btohqsg
yall so upzi only got 50+rpüò∞,btohqsg
I know that you might feel disappointed with yourself but keep pressing on  alright!,btohqsg

I think we have to though,btohqsg
But idk because the procedure might be different. Since in N levels they added extra topics to replace the CLTs. Which didn‚Äôt happen in Os,btohqsg
I think so  but probably depends on school,btohqsg
they didnt add extra topics to replace clt,btohqsg
they just removed clt and thats it,btohqsg

uni scholarship prolly need at least like 80rp to have a slim chance of getting,btohqsg
I only got 1 more year HAHAH,btohqsg
I looking at the bonded ones tbh,btohqsg
This pretty much guarantees a scholarship in a local university,btohqsg
I know someone who got gahmen scholarship on 85rp,btohqsg
and then realise that u hate the job/industry,btohqsg
Its a bit er open season if u get higher than 85,btohqsg
I‚Äôve heard of President scholars that got 87.5 RO,btohqsg
Ya its not pegged to 90,btohqsg
but the portfolio must be super upz,btohqsg

Can someone answer my qn.  If I take BCME and I have not done pure phy in sec sch  am i still eligible for engineering courses in nus/ntu?,btohqsg
Isn't there like some bridging modules to teach a bit of phy?,btohqsg
This is why PCME is better,btohqsg
No pure bio and pure chem,btohqsg
If u intended to take engineering  why did u not take Phy??,btohqsg
No i am asking for my friend. He took bcme as he wants to study medicine. But he is scared he might not be able to get in so he is thinking of any possible backup plans.,btohqsg
Taking PCME would have allowed him to enter both medicine and engineering,btohqsg
True  but his sec school did not offer triple sci and he really wanted to study bio.,btohqsg
Coz he said he was kinda interested in that as well,btohqsg
Ask him to check the uni websites they do show whats required for each courseE.g.http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level/subject-pre-requisites,btohqsg

guys do you guys know any cheap tution center for secondary school one,btohqsg
ownself find uni students willing to give tuition for 20 dollars a session,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think rates are that Low these days tbh,btohqsg
I would do it for that cheap,btohqsg
few of my friends start out also that cheap,btohqsg
i abit no hope for private one liao,btohqsg
cause i want can provide materials one,btohqsg
well if you're under financial aid  approach organisations  some might be able to help!,btohqsg
im currently a volunteer tutor under an organisation anyway,btohqsg
as a uni student  i think that rarely happens,btohqsg
or jc girl abt to go uni,btohqsg
More reliably can get materials one,btohqsg
just go carousell can find one hor,btohqsg
imo providing materials in sec sch a bit hard,btohqsg
only materials provided usually is crafted worksheets,btohqsg
even i dont give materials for sec sch  not needed,btohqsg
hi if anyone wants pure chem or pure phy materials pls dm me asap!! (for o lvls) I have tons and tons of tb workbooks etc ty:-),btohqsg
unless u want like v summarised notes,btohqsg
^ is this promotion idk sorry:|,btohqsg
i mean cause mostly when i go private is i ask some questions i don‚Äôt understand an d the tutor to read and solve the questions which takes time,btohqsg
better to do urself then get from others,btohqsg
and some like when they explain abit confusing as well,btohqsg
ah thats why need face to face ma,btohqsg
tbh doesn't mean notes will help if u dont understand their explanation,btohqsg
physical but I hv digital stuff too my parents want me to clear my stuff asap tho,btohqsg
usually ppl will ask for help if they dont understand notes to begin with,btohqsg
thats why i kinda need like stalford those kind of tution,btohqsg
but stalford is 60 for 1hr30 i dont have the money üòî,btohqsg
u want those that teach from scratch one ah,btohqsg
even i do that amt for 1hr30min,btohqsg
if u wanna expect $25/h or low rates  usually dont have too much high hopes on what u can get out of it,btohqsg
i think ill try find private one again,btohqsg
usually those that do very low rates are either fresh grads (from jc/poly) or they aren't rly good,btohqsg
if is the former  its worth a try,btohqsg
bruh this made me remember i had beef with this nanyang tution center,btohqsg
ya they also have a telegram grp also,btohqsg
u must have done something lor,btohqsg
i only replied like 2 days late,btohqsg

ok not rly but doable la,btohqsg
and i was a f9 student for amath,btohqsg
all u need to do is just,btohqsg
know ur concept/content well for every chapter,btohqsg
this is true amath isn't rly that difficult when ur used to it,btohqsg
honestly true but its just if you didn‚Äôt do for like 2 days you forget everything liao,btohqsg
If that's the case  it means u have no interest in the subject,btohqsg
wah when i was in sec sch uhh,btohqsg
no lah its just i have mild adhd and i lose concentration easily,btohqsg
the teacher useless then we need self study completely,btohqsg
consult your teachers if they're good!,btohqsg
So you‚Äôre done if it‚Äôs humanities,btohqsg
try mindstretcher.. went there last year and it‚Äôs q affordable? $200 per subj,btohqsg
tuition centers in general kinda ew,btohqsg
true ba  for me i prefer either 1 to 1 or small grp if i had to choose,btohqsg
