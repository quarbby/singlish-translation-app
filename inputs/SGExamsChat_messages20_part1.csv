This is supposed to be an exams chat group,btohqsg
Now it is a ns chat group,btohqsg
3 admins are becoming NSFs this year,btohqsg
This group is whatever I want it to be,btohqsg
Time for everyone around me to leave again,btohqsg
Well deki is our batch so I would assume a lot of people are same batch,btohqsg
She wanted to take FM lol,btohqsg
Many of the people I am aware of here are same batch,btohqsg
We dumb batch so we need to talk to each other,btohqsg
Then like say she kind of regret not taking FM,btohqsg
Now we doing JC talk lmao,btohqsg
You can be like potate the true math fm computing chad,btohqsg
Imagine specialising in a single field,btohqsg
@andrewomeyea I asked him to do that,btohqsg
I literally am the one who convinced him,btohqsg
Coz he put physics instead of FM,btohqsg
Because he was warned that the subject combi was a bit limiting,btohqsg
But end day if he wishes to pursue computing then that physics won't make a damn difference,btohqsg
Like coz they ask him to put what combi he want coz he DSA,btohqsg
Deki didn’t meet requirement but she nvr appeal,btohqsg
That’s how she ended up with chem computing,btohqsg
I think she actually wanted FM computing,btohqsg
Then she took chem bio only so she can only take chem,btohqsg
On hindsight can't rlly tell which would be more killer,btohqsg
If u no interest in math,btohqsg
Well i did chem in jc and some fm in uni,btohqsg
I really cmi the math portions,btohqsg
My chem and FM classmates all were people who just wanted to get rid of their Physics/Bio,btohqsg
They no interest in math one,btohqsg
Then they like legit die in FM,btohqsg
The other 2 just fail all the way,btohqsg
I have classmates who took fm to escape Chem too,btohqsg
4 H2 CFME plus SC VP,btohqsg
Just that arts subject only can choose econs or CLL,btohqsg
Isn’t that what you want anyway,btohqsg
Some schools are like can only choose physics but like they dun care bout the arts subject,btohqsg
The rest of the FM all PFME or PFMCLL,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionbeg to differ coz my class is always top 2 for physics,btohqsg
is anyone else feeling stressed for block exams,btohqsg
We prelim 2nd right but lose to like one class but then they had to calculate the MSG to 2 dp,btohqsg
How they did the MSG was like A is 1 B is 2,btohqsg
I think many beg to differ,btohqsg
Chem is free U to many people,btohqsg
If that’s so why A level tele group got so many chem qn,btohqsg
Some people take the subject just coz more options,btohqsg
That’s why I’m like nobody would say chem>physics coz quite a lot just take for the sake of uni choices,btohqsg
But I have Hep B so I can’t even donate,btohqsg
I’m the most useless blood type O guy,btohqsg
I can’t even save ur life,btohqsg
Plus I got excuse for blood handling vocation,btohqsg
