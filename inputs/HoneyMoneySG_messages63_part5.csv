Is this chocolate finance legit? Why its name like some defi name eg macaron finance pancake finance.. know doesn‚Äôt guaranteed by sdic   how about 4.5% return is that guarantee?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a bank ‚Ä¶ how to sdic ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
the company guarantees the 4.5% interest. The underlying amount is still securities if if the company becomes bankrupt  the amount u put in is still safe  but will be priced at market value based on my understanding,btohqsg

Hi there :) Currently i already have the Citi Rewards + Amaze pair running  would it be advisable to also get a HSBC Revo if my spending per month exceeds 1k for overflow?Even if the miles has a much shorter expiry date compared to citi rewards  figured that no annual fee and the flexibility to convert it into cashback anyway is a good plus,btohqsg
The syfe 3.7% guaranteed is it got an option to auto reinvest for recurring 3 months?,btohqsg
Eligible insurance  not investment plan for the 1.4%?,btohqsg
One thing needs to remind that miles earned from HSBC revo does not necessarily have shorter expiry date than Citi rewards. Miles from Citi rewards can have expiry date as short as 3 months only because Citi rewards use fixed expiry date.,btohqsg
Is it a good to Use cpf OA to invest in the upcoming t bill ?,btohqsg
I see  then how would the HSBC Revo compare to Citi PremierMiles as a secondary card? Would it be more beneficial to have the miles that dont expire instead?,btohqsg
Do anyone know what are the eligible plan?,btohqsg
How does the expiry for miles work exactly? Like i earned 120000 points at the end of first year  converted them to miles that means the miles have only 2 years of expiry? In case for hsbc and 4 years in case of citi?,btohqsg
You need to estimate how much is your expenses in next 2-5 years n what are those expenses( can earn miles?)  then calculate are you able to redeem your dream ticket before the miles expired.There is no one shoe can fit everybody foot. You need to understand your expenses  pattern  then strategise your card usage.,btohqsg
anyone knows how soon amaze card will credit the insta points after making the transaction?,btohqsg
I only got the one on pepper lunch then the two transactions after that i realized nothing was credited yetAlso i did not use amaze walletAny idea why?,btohqsg
Citi rewards: expiry date is based on card approval date which is fixed date. Eg. 5 years from card approval date. Hence  all your points will expire on the same day regardless when you earn it.HSBC revo: 37 months from the date you earned the points. Hence  your point will expire in batches.,btohqsg
only earn instapoints if at least SGD 10,btohqsg

hi! any masters using uob one cc can help me pls. if i have $50 for acb with mrt/bus  am i eligible for 3.33% + 5%(acb) OR 5% ? also  for first tier of cashback if i spent 800 first month  and 500 following both month  do i get cashback for the additional 300 spent on first month?,btohqsg
Hello  earlier in the year there was a HSBC EGA + revo promotion where we could get 300 + 350 for the account and card. Could I check if anyone got this cashback  HSBC keeps saying that because I got credit card sign up bonus I‚Äôm not entitled to EGA welcome offer anymore.. and their customer service is absolutely trash,btohqsg
Common. British owned bank is mostly very arrogant one. Still tot they are the empire on which the sun never sets,btohqsg
Actually HSBC customer service is thrashy because they chopped and reduced a lot of their agents.,btohqsg
if you met tiered spending for all 3 statement months of quarter  u get tiered quarterly rebate AND additional cashback for specific merchants e.g. 5% for mrt/bus,btohqsg
yup  so will my mrt/bus spending gain 8.33% or 5% cashback?,btohqsg
quarterly rebate+5%. Based on your spending so far  you can get at most $50 quarterly rebate effective less than 3.33%.,btohqsg
I received both through SingSaver. Though I had to call the bank and appeal that I fulfilled all criteria for HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
If the miles/points are still with credit card bank account  the expiry date of miles/points follows bank TnC.Once you convert the miles/points and credits into airline partners‚Äô account  the miles will follow airlines TnC which has separate life span from the date the miles credited into the airline account.,btohqsg
Hi   I have some query on the T Bills   under the CDP  free column  there is a 1010  it should be only 1000 right?,btohqsg

so could you technically wait for when your point are expiring and convert it all to miles to the airline partners then does it kinda extends the expiry?,btohqsg
Yes if you can do it before points expiring. Just don‚Äôt walk alone the edge of cliff  give some safety distance.,btohqsg
