Oh yes I need his psychic powers üôèüèª,btohqsg
That doesn‚Äôt make it less attractive. Just coz a bank is not strong in miles doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it not as attractive to others. It‚Äôs like saying this chicken rice not nice because don‚Äôt have soup but other store got soup,btohqsg
Chicken rice need soup. No soup not nice. üò°,btohqsg
I wonder got Amex Ascend promotion orNot.,btohqsg
EZ-link app got QR scanner? Can enlighten me  how to get it pay?,btohqsg
Actually they have is the 3 miles selected categories bonus earn for scb journey card.. choices even less than hsbc revolution white list,btohqsg
But after 1st July  Diners won‚Äôt be accepted for SGQR payment anymore. But through Ez-link still can work?,btohqsg
yes  only diners will be removed cuz diners wants to remove their diners pay app,btohqsg
Perhaps you need a contingency plan - carry cash.Eg. Hp spoilt  hp stolen  battery flat  network down  etc‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Maybe you can look at a bigger picture and think from other perspectives  not everything is about miles,btohqsg
He need to redeem his trip to Vietnam...,btohqsg
The way DINERS announcd sounds like they are removing themselves from SGQR code system forever.,btohqsg
yeap  they dunwan to be the proxy anymore probably same for xnap i guess,btohqsg
I hope there is spontaneous escape coming for year end holiday,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs the case  having DINERS inside Ez-link app to scan for SGQR won‚Äôt work after 1st July?,btohqsg
wdym? ez-link mastercard is a wallet system similar to grab wallet. u can use credit card to top up to the wallet. anyway  can try using dcs app if u see any unionpay qr code.https://dcscc.com/dcs-cards-app#QR-payment,btohqsg
Which means the Hawker Centre needs to have this ‚ÄúEz-link ‚Äù logo display then can use?,btohqsg
yeap  u're right. most of the places that accepts credit card payments will usually have the logo anyway,btohqsg
Usually is they don't have. They prefer paynow .,btohqsg
yeah those are the stores that dun accept credit cards to begin with,btohqsg
Thinking of switching to ONE card soon but broadband and telco considered towards the spend to get CB ?,btohqsg
can use their simulator calculator to calculate the cashbackhttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card-cashback-calculator.page,btohqsg
under recurring bill payments  u'll be able to find a list of merchants there,btohqsg
Must be recurring ? I mean if I pay monthly online for zym and StarHub broadband does it entitled cb ? Thx,btohqsg
payment mode dun matter  telco mcc eligible for cashback,btohqsg
Yes. but need to apply for early accesshttps://heymax.notion.site/Fly-Anywhere-with-heymax-ai-aff0d2e5912d433283dc31f8e9d274c1,btohqsg
Interesting. Just that the way to earn their max miles is limited. Almost all I didn't shop with.,btohqsg
Guys .. I going to delete heymax soon. I don't find them reliable,btohqsg
Go ahead and in future no need to announce here lah,btohqsg
One point people overlooked is that multiplier offers flat EIR from the first dollar. So it's great for putting in your last $x below 100k.,btohqsg
Treasures online equity trading account for no min comms trading. For cdp charges  because the transaction is so low valued  their fees were rounded down to zero. Lol. So total transaction is only 10c.,btohqsg
I found alternatives to heymax. Is use suitesmile.  What card to use for.,btohqsg
I gotten my slot at GXS !!!,btohqsg
New from uob to share.With Cash+ Xtra  you can achieve higher yields on your idle cash to counteract today‚Äôs high inflation while having the flexibility to access your cash. Here‚Äôs why:‚úÖ Designed to offer stability and capital preservation with its responsiveness to different market conditions‚úÖ Suitable for the conservative investor as the portfolio holds high quality  low-risk assets‚úÖ Access your cash quickly with no lock-in period and no withdrawal penalties‚úÖ No platform fees  withdrawal penalties or hidden charges.*Projected yield calculated as of 28 March 2024. Not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt overlook  there are others like BOC and EGA that are flat EIR as well with higher rates. Mainly it‚Äôs UOB and OCBC that likes to play with tier interest rates.Another thing is that unlike most banks  Multiplier bonus interest are daily accrued instead of based on MAB  which makes it less suitable for those with volatile cashflow.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGUOb evol actually is better for folks like you? Ie worth if go often to Malaysia and clock for the 10%?,btohqsg
It is not exactly 10 percent if u count the effective interest rate  most prob around 6 plus  i prefer maybank fnf over evol if go malaysia,btohqsg
small spend trust still best fx rates,btohqsg
I think about it first  then make a video,btohqsg
woot chris gonna do a revise review,btohqsg
I not after best exchange rate with card  am after the good cashback rate after all bank fee,btohqsg
same visa fx rate  just that uob have 3.25% fx fee,btohqsg
ya the fx fee is a zzz,btohqsg
That why u need a good cashback card to spend for foreign currency which still give u net gain after the bank fee,btohqsg
Agree. MBFF 8% for RM spend is the best. No fight,btohqsg
Let said if flight is 100 SGD  I will required to have 5556 max miles in my account?I thought I can claim if my account have no max miles yetIs it this 5556 max miles will be deduct from my account after claim to pay now?,btohqsg
Yes. Need to have 5556 max miles first,btohqsg
6.2% if clock $800 min spend and $50 cashback ($30 online+mobile  $20 overseas physical)  3.75% if only clock $800 min spend and $30 cashback.,btohqsg
I might be thinking this uob one account shd be given up. 800 min spend on evol card üôÑ,btohqsg
You still can clock with UOB One card 500 min spend  or with UOB Lady's card. If you use either card  UOB EVOL's changes will not affect you.,btohqsg
