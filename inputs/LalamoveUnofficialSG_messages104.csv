10am to 1pm. Travelling around 80km from start to end point,btohqsg
Delivery platforms mostly just letting riders absorb rising fuel costs.,btohqsg
Only those logistics companies with own fleet feeling the fuel rise.,btohqsg
Oil price will keep rising  even after war. Sanctions on Russia will continue even after war ends. Not going to lift for a long while. Russia has already cut oil production.,btohqsg
My yellow pannier and my rear box got filled by one single order. Even if the weight didn‚Äôt hit the limit  the volume is at least twice that allowed for bike orders. I‚Äôll carry a weight scale next time‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If exceed the volume limit  isnt it cancel would be better ?,btohqsg
Waiting for an available agent to reply  war already over ü§£,btohqsg
Unless you called beforehand  wont get compensation if cx cancel. Already made the trip there  spent the petrol  time and parking already. Better just complete the job and avoid that cx in the future.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs an incentive for hirers to not say anything and just give a surprise,btohqsg
The orange flask is my own. But 11 bottles of sake way exceeds the volume allowed for a single bike job too.,btohqsg
I just have a way to cater to carry large loads but it‚Äôs sometimes a SURPRISE! Not necessarily in a good sense,btohqsg
People who are cheap  and think they can get away by not hiring a car job,btohqsg
Sorry  i am new here. The purpose of calling customer is to confirm the delivery ?,btohqsg
It's in the SOP  when you accept any job  the app prompts you to call  to confirm the details.,btohqsg
11 sake is way too dangerous.But if really the case that is exceed your capabilities. End up need to cancel also right.,btohqsg
Anyone have van rental company intro? Thinking change from bike to van,btohqsg
Wonder is this the SOP that most ppl follow ?  ü§£,btohqsg
No  but you cant get the 50% for cancelled jobs if you can't prove you called beforehand to confirm.,btohqsg
Thanks. So should just accept and go. That‚Äôs the fastest. Time is money anyway.,btohqsg
Nope. I was just able to contain it all in my bike‚Ä¶ right at the limit. üòÖ,btohqsg
Long time ago when I first started llm. Noob. Took the job even when it was bike job I car,btohqsg
Not worth. Somemore no place to park outside the shop. Need park opp at hk Street or further down at North canal Road n carry over,btohqsg
They 95% of the time ask for bike even though is multi stop liquor,btohqsg
Do 1 time no do liao,btohqsg
Liquor n say fragile then ask for bike. N so much stuff. If break how? Sure blame rider,btohqsg
Is it the jap shop at 55 south bridge road? They cant even provide a decent bag for us to carry also,btohqsg
Dunno if the above bro took from there. Last time the 1 I took from was at South Bridge Road yes,btohqsg

You also so lucky Ah‚Ä¶ bike or car for you?,btohqsg
some clients just don't seem to read.... or just want to squeeze the max out of a single bike trip ALTHOUGH there are dimension/weight limits,btohqsg
15-30 bento boxes. Need trolley if car. Then y ask for bike.,btohqsg
Madness. 15 or 30‚Ä¶ is a 100% difference!!,btohqsg
Get used to it guys... Just laugh it off  and keep your inner peace. So can stroke 4d....,btohqsg
I used to take their orders and then call them and fuck them upside down... Most of them cancel there after..,btohqsg
End of the day.. I have leanrt to laugh it off... But the only thing i still cannot get.. Is... Why people still take the orders.,btohqsg
But honestly guys... Nowadays bike prices are pretty good for those surge areas. If u find worth it. Just take.,btohqsg
It's normal I m sure got motor take b4...,btohqsg

Can take single trip bike with surge to stack if drive car,btohqsg
Even for car or mpv they book... But wanna send hugh of over weight thing..i do until sian sometimes,btohqsg
Its much more worth if the car job u doing is far distance. Far distance bike surges r norm very high,btohqsg
The bike COEs are not helping üòõ,btohqsg
Poor lor... If rich where got want  do this kind rip off job,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not upset; for those that I took‚Ä¶ done deal; won‚Äôt want to take those again.But without violating PDPA  maybe we should have some sort of a list of ‚Äúbest to reject clients‚Äù,btohqsg
Some is Lan lan go there see the load then realise Kena con... Cannot cancel aso... Another fucked up feature of LLM. That's y a lot cb client any job aso put motor... If can walker they aso put,btohqsg
Two days back there was a cancellation‚Ä¶ I met one other LLM guy with the exact same order as me at a HDB doorstep.Apparently some other person already picked up the item and left; and that means we had the exact same order for 3 persons? üòÖ,btohqsg

Thank you for sharing this Bro. Respect! For new drivers  extremely helpful. It‚Äôs just amazing to observe all these unethical users around. The response from the owner was very much defensive. Why on earth drivers would want to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù that couple of dollars? Always take the orders with our feet  not our knees. Help each other to protect that sense of dignity. We do not need to beg for that little money.,btohqsg

Maybe that's y recently keep losing bids. Since they say service rating affects job bid success üòî,btohqsg
Average of the last 40 ratings. (39x5+4)/40=4.975  rounded up to 4.98.,btohqsg
You'd have to wait for the 4.0 to move out of the last 40 to return to 5.0.,btohqsg
Think you have a single 3 star  result is 4.95.,btohqsg
That's y I dunno how they calculate the service rating of poor good excellent. The 1-5 score I know,btohqsg

I court how much I earn per trip when I take order.,btohqsg
Llm dont allow stacking anymore.....sad....but if do it...who will know?,btohqsg
Usually  stack trip earn lesser then normal trip,btohqsg
Same question I had in mind,btohqsg
And $4 per trip is too low. Grab & FP paid much higher per trip,btohqsg
I have been doing stacked otherwise most of the deliver not worth the petrol. Work as mall screener earns more.,btohqsg
Best I did was stack 3orders $78 sent in 1hr. Lols,btohqsg
That 1 they put there forever liao,btohqsg
To me  cannot stack means we can only do 1 job each time  the system don't let us take anotherüòÇ,btohqsg
I also thought so. But if the following day  you can accept more than 2... Somehow they allow it... It was kinda experimenting cause the deliver is so near.. such a waste not to try.,btohqsg
$78 after commission ah? That's alot sia,btohqsg
Nowdays most jobs very low price,btohqsg
Yealah. System only figure out if you have ongoing 2 orders  they won't allow you to take anymore.,btohqsg
Next surcharge is good friday period,btohqsg
One time off lah.. quite dangerous  need proper coordination and time well,btohqsg
No + now very hard to get high price,btohqsg
Travel up from tampines to Senoko... Should also take that as part of your working hours equation,btohqsg
Investment.. win some lose some at times. lols,btohqsg
Cos u say 1 hr  I though all short trip,btohqsg
This is a good price  cos u stack 3. Long distance must stack or else not worth,btohqsg
Long trip. But delivery location nearby... Lucky.,btohqsg
I nvr take too advanced jobs  so nvr get to stack more than 2üòÇ,btohqsg
Stack is necessary for some part of time  otherwise  you earn too little  below minimum wage I guess.lols!,btohqsg
I stubborn. Always want to wait for higher priceüòÇ,btohqsg
But now very very difficult cos jobs out gone immediately. N bids so hard to win,btohqsg
N I very calculative  so always choosy abt the jobs üòÇ,btohqsg
Pickupp sticker. They pay you $75/mth.Lalamove they got pay you? Or just priority?,btohqsg
For every bis...how many agents is max to bid 3?,btohqsg
100 for some other position on the car,btohqsg
Oh they as well.. oh ok. Nubbad,btohqsg
I tot 50 100 is very very low,btohqsg
Put lalamove 3d bird logo on top of the car? Lols!,btohqsg
What agent are you referring to. I dun quite understand.,btohqsg
Scarly put sticker also lose bid cos I is only good rating not excellent üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyway by default when u bid  it always shows 2 even when u 1 person bidding,btohqsg
For every bid for the order....how many driver can bid... normally can see 2 drivers bidding,btohqsg
Yeah. That's what I witness/suspect as well.,btohqsg
I guess I kinda enjoy the suspense too... Even though I am very sure I am the only one bidding,btohqsg
I also cannot get the jobüò¢üòÇ,btohqsg
Hahaha I think you are secretly being banned. The ops side come together to have a good laugh each time you lose the bid. It's their past time.,btohqsg
Maoyou so free. Are you working for lalamove now - lunchtime?,btohqsg
Tues n wed off day for meüòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe cos I always very harsh to llm when they send me those late sms pls explain stuff,btohqsg
I always kena when I take those rescue ordersüòÇ,btohqsg
Cos too low not worth it. Especially petrol up. Then sometimes must calculate whether can in n out for pickup b4 cp grace period up. If illegal park got probability of summon. Alot of costsüòÇ,btohqsg
Worst nightmare.I think fine part and parcel. Good luck man,btohqsg
Walao damn ugly.  Even though mine is normal car.. I still find it eyesore,btohqsg
Pay money park inside cp . Dun give them Chan,btohqsg
All job taken by hungry drivers liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Order less... More office workers go bk office. After work go restoran eat... Who still order makan üòÇ,btohqsg
Think alot rental co buy new cars... Hearsay grab cannot use Coe cars start this yr,btohqsg
Causeway will be busy with worker travel in n out liao,btohqsg
Dun go in first . Let them test market.. go in wait no car no clothes come bkü§£,btohqsg
Now peak hr not much order? Price like shit too,btohqsg
Y always for bike only? What abt car,btohqsg
does the chart mean that there is a ceiling fee for current pricing for bike distance?,btohqsg
May I check if the rating review max that show in the apps is 20 ?,btohqsg
only the 10th kilometer is $2.40  it's 35c/km before that and 40c/km after the 11th. There is sharp fee jump at 10km  unless the chart got typo.,btohqsg
Yah don't understand y like thatüòÇ,btohqsg
but those long distance multi-drops will be a bit fairer price.,btohqsg
Only the 10-11km $2.40  after that $0.40/km,btohqsg
They shld just make it more than 11km  from start every km is $0.40,btohqsg
Anyway car rate no go upü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
7x jump.. if it's true .  Then no job le. Nobody will use llm,btohqsg
Only affects long distance trips. Most under 10km food deliveries not affected.,btohqsg
who got full bar pls show i want to see lol,btohqsg
Now job so little how to hit.. so lame,btohqsg
Lol I long time ago bor chup the mission liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
I also want see. Maybe those new driver just sign up got full barüòÇ,btohqsg
how got 1 bar also can show here as well lol,btohqsg
It starts in the middle which makes more sense than start at max. The star rating starts at perfect 5.0 so any change can only be for the worse - no improvement possible. Starting in the middle gives it room to go both ways.,btohqsg
but dunno why yours started at poor. i havent done llm for a while  my rating is exact center  star rating 5.0.,btohqsg
Tahan for another few more weeks can drop to bronzeüòÇ,btohqsg
I tahan for few wks liao finally drop to bronze,btohqsg
