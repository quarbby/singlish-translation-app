Hi  can I check is anyone knows about vehicle warranty. I just bought a new vehicle and intend to fix amplifier and woofer but was told that under warranty I am not supposed to fix anything into my new vehicle. Its will void the warranty. Is it true? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
If it involves splicing of wires… warranty void for sure,btohqsg
ik wearnes v an@l about this kind of shit they will void warranty for batt,btohqsg
ehh i think probs only batt warranty will be voided,btohqsg
if its batt then its still okay cos batt is cheap to replace but if they void they whole car warranty then i think you should reconsider,btohqsg
PIs can be a bit more @n@l,btohqsg
And also warranty for headunit will go away,btohqsg
I'm guessing that's aftermarket anyway as in most vezels,btohqsg
