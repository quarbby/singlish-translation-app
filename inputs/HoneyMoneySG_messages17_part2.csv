I think stopped liao. The promo is removed from their page,btohqsg
Hi all can use credit card to pay bills ?Is there any extra fees that need to be paid using credit card for bill?Lastly what the best credit card for paying recurring bills ?,btohqsg
Signed up using your referral code. May I ask what is the strategy in terms of converting credit card reward points to KrisFlyer Miles?,btohqsg
Guys. I have one qn that might had already be answered before. Just want to check.For the things we charged to amaze card + Citibank rewards card  the transaction will be counted towards online spending thus 10x rewards.However if I use the amaze card to pay like insurance or hospital bills  will the Citibank rewards card still count it towards online payment and 10x rewards?Because I see that Citibank rewards card exclude rewards for insurance and hospital bills and some others.,btohqsg
I tried searching for this but did not find anything,btohqsg
Hmm may I ask what‚Äôs everyone strategy for hawker Centre payments? Gonna use LiquidPay  Grab Pay wallet for now,btohqsg
i use liquid pay whenever possible and grabpay if only have that option,btohqsg
Can refer to above two documents. Both are excluded. Think better use UOB Amex card,btohqsg
some hawker also now have shopback pay. Thats better 4 mpd + cashback,btohqsg
Yes I read this. So I am wonder if I use the amaze card  will it ‚Äúhide‚Äù the insurance payment under normal online spending thus getting the extra rewards.,btohqsg
I think Chris and few members here confirm MCC code still applies unfortunately:(,btohqsg
Ah thanks. Sorry for repeating the qn. Thank you üôè,btohqsg
Dont convert your card points to Kris+ unless you have a small pool of orphan points that are due to expire,btohqsg
E.g. you have 18 000 DBS points expiring this quarterCan only redeem in blocks of 5000 points for Kirsflyer so 15 000 pts used3000 points expiring can convert to Kris+,btohqsg
hospital bill not excluded  insurance excluded,btohqsg
Hi guys where to enroll into Nestia cashback after I activate the wallet?,btohqsg
Thanks for the inputs. Wonder if following counts-Cancel after 1 year cos annual fees not waived-not enough spending on card egOnly few hundreds spent in a year,btohqsg
Yea.. about that.. Nestia seems to have stopped their cashback promo,btohqsg
You can only use krispay miles to buy ntuc voucher using the Kris+ app not revolution card,btohqsg
I recalled other  banks don't have the 1st XXX applicants.,btohqsg
can pay using cc  get rebate/points. No fees,btohqsg
I hope Citi will have this feature too,btohqsg
- maybank family and friends for 8% rebate capped for $312.50 telco spend  need min $800 in month (can get 8% for other categories)- If can pay online  citi rewards or dbs wwmc for 4 miles per dollar  6.66% for uob evol or 5% on dbs livefresh,btohqsg
Possibly. The bank will not say the actual reason for the rejection also.,btohqsg
If it is excluded in the CC t&c then it doesn't give the 10x rewards. Pairing with with amaze is just to convert offline to online. The underlying transactions need to be a valid MCC and not excluded in CRMC T&Cs,btohqsg
The power of this telegram group‚Ä¶ üòÇ,btohqsg
