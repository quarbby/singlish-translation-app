Good day for me. Good luck bros,btohqsg
ensure u have proof to show that can reach at the later timing cos the LLM system will auto generate the sms to you.then u select customer requested later timing as the appeal reason. substantiate with proof and u will be fine,btohqsg
Hi guys is it worth to do lalamove with a car?,btohqsg
Another way is to live chat to cs. Inform Cs that customer requested for the drop to be delivered at later time. State the time.  Then screenshot the chat and use it as proof if required,btohqsg
Hmm  I think it‚Äôs subjective.I do llm part time with my car.Honestly  I think it‚Äôs not bad la ( on the high side for me ). I don‚Äôt use a lot of petrol too but most of the time I always get motorcycle ordersüòÇ,btohqsg
I see.. was thinking if pick up motorcycle orders are worth it with the current petrol price..,btohqsg
Only by trying out will you get your answer,btohqsg
Now petrol too exp. Not that worth imo,btohqsg
Other platforms already increase rate. GOGO vaN caN cancel after calling client if does not suit. CB llm cannot,btohqsg
Careful of this shop in Sultan Plaza. Cash delivery but don‚Äôt want to pay cash.,btohqsg
If really want to do llm  only do those u are familiar with n always release early so u cM stack. If not how to survive,btohqsg
Paynow also don‚Äôt want to pay.,btohqsg
Said will only pay at midnight. Wtf! Asked him to go sleep with snake 1st.,btohqsg
Or collect money at pickup . Ask him to paynow in front of u before u leave with the item.. if he doesn't paynow u... ask him to cancel job lor..,btohqsg
Better to protect urself than kena con and do job for free..  and don't think the LLM team will help u collect.. they can only call and call... if customer dun pay also bo pian..,btohqsg
Urgently recruiting part-time employees  you can earn $300 a day at home with a touch of your finger  those with relevant work experience or investment experience are preferred  Telegram:@Be_Annei,btohqsg
This spam bot is clearly able to generate multiple accounts  so muting might be a better strategy  rather than outright banning  since the banned accounts will just be replaced.,btohqsg
There's Viamove if feeling adventurous. Rate lower than llm but if u stack it with Pickupp & Uparcel can be worth it. Last time Uparcel payout is fortnightly which kinda sucks.,btohqsg
Morning... Will never do cash delivery,btohqsg
Hello ! Anybody tried llm with bicycle ?,btohqsg
I cancelled the order once he refused to pay. Just wasted time to contact live chat.,btohqsg
Of course he will nvr pay..Genuine customer will always Paynow in front of u...If he cancelled the order means he nvr meant to pay u after the delivery... i wont worry about the half delivery fee coz i would have been cheated of the full fee after doing the delivery..,btohqsg
Anyone received payment for waiting time before? Just completed the retraining and realised last year when I do like dun have payment for waiting time.,btohqsg
I received a couple of time for reimbursement of waiting time. No issue for me so far,btohqsg
You need to contact CS via app chat which can be a hassle. Need to report while waiting after collection time. Example: 11am pickup time  u can report to CS if not ready by 1101. However  waiting charges only apply after the 10th min  meaning if you waited for 11min - $2  21 min $4 and so forth.,btohqsg
someone posted here on 12 feb. cs sent a link to a claim form for waiting fee. not automatic.,btohqsg
11min to 20min - $2  21min to 30min $4. But you need to complete the job. If halfway  you give up and cancel. Cannot claim,btohqsg
I submitted few weeks ago and no respond from them at all. And i have chat with CS 2 times aldy. Yet still no news. I gave up.,btohqsg
When will get? For posb bank,btohqsg

Hi.. just curious.. do we have a time limit to complete those medicine deliveries?,btohqsg
Usually not much delivery at this timing in the morning?,btohqsg
So what time is good to start?,btohqsg
But will have multiple stop jobs once awhile,btohqsg
there's a delivery window for that. u have to pass to patient before the window is up. usually they will call around 2 hours before the window is up.sometimes they consolidate 2 window periods into one delivery e.g.  7-10pm and 8-11pm. ensure those that choose 7-10pm is delivered before 10pm and likewise for 11pm.,btohqsg
Last time got see job ask for bike to deliver mattress,btohqsg
