It‚Äôs literally down there in your screenshot on the ‚Äúnew fund‚Äù criteria,btohqsg
It depends on what you need. If you want tax relief  I would advise to top up 8k each year. However you must not that cash top up RSTU is ringfenced whereby if you transfer OA to SA is not.,btohqsg
Mean can lor cos never do before even same day or must wait for end of the month,btohqsg
It‚Äôs compared against your 31 Dec 2023 balance. What was your balance then?,btohqsg
New here‚Ä¶ and about to take on a mortgage. Could I please ask which provider (cardup/ipaymy) and credit card pairing is best?,btohqsg
It says Dec 31st balance. You xfer out xfer in doesn‚Äôt matter if the funds you xfer in less than the min amount compare to your balance on Dec 31st,btohqsg
But my fund is my UOB fd just end so my Dec balance not much Nia,btohqsg
So what's your eligible account you are planning to register with  and how much does it have at 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
I have UOB uniplus and UOB one and UOB fd does UOB fd count?,btohqsg
pls read the TnC instead of asking random questions,btohqsg
so far any return on wekend and ph?,btohqsg
Hi experts  anyone knows for SCB Smart cc  $250 min spend is it within 30 days? when does it start?,btohqsg

Hello guys  trying to pool some ideas togetherI have to hit AMEX bonus but as I have other cards that really do 4mpd  any ideas for what I can pay with it?A lot of online spend  I have my revo  AMAZE + CITI  PPV can do 4mpd. Same for paywave‚Ä¶,btohqsg
U have to choose u want amex bonus or the 4mpd from other card. It is that simple.,btohqsg
Let say $1k spend for Amex bonus34k points + 1200 base point for ascend$1k on CRMC 4K point ?I think clearly shows which earn more right ?,btohqsg
not if I really wanna squeeze and AMEX bonus is only for all non 4mpd expenses üòÑ,btohqsg
Travel is 1 categories all 3 card don‚Äôt have  since hsbc nerf it recently,btohqsg
I think better to just clear the bonus  less trouble to think about it later ?Or if you really want to squeeze and  let say big spending coming up then spend 4mpd card max out all then leftover throw into Amex,btohqsg
huh then why still need to ask lol,btohqsg
only you will know what you have to spend on  then use those that dont qualify on amex and see if can hit the required spending. if cannot then you have to sacrifice certain 4mpd on amex,btohqsg
Any hack to clock the kris+ Feb master challenge,btohqsg
Can I confirm that I can withdraw the available balance in UOB One Account after earmarking?,btohqsg
I have uob women for that,btohqsg
Yea... I'm hunting for pple with that bigger purchase :(,btohqsg
I would maintain 31 Dec balance + earmark amount at all times. In accordance with their tnc.,btohqsg
Mine was Christmas promo  earmarked in Jan  and the available balance was mostly from salary credit and interest in the last 2 mths,btohqsg
I would maintain 30 sep balance + earmark amount at all times. In accordance with their tnc.,btohqsg
Ask your older relative with no card  offer to pay on your card and take their cash then,btohqsg
Plan to buy gold at shop  but beside the card fees they charge another 1.5% for using cards. So overall would it still be worth it?,btohqsg
Gold got spread de  buy and sell price unless u keeping for long term invesment and only gold bar retain value,btohqsg
Good morning guys  can I use my Kris flyer membership to earn miles from my family members?,btohqsg
So the individual person should have own krisflyer membership to earn krisflyer miles right? Or can add them as our nominees to earn miles?,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt use your KrisFlyer to earn for your family . They need to have their own account to credit. The nominees is for u to use your own miles to redeem for tickets for your family members.,btohqsg
Sir I saw a t&c in airlines websites and it states that KrisFlyer members who purchase tickets for their nominees but who are not part of the itinerary will not earn KrisFlyer miles.What this things means?,btohqsg
Means if u nvr travel. U only buy for your parents. Only ur parents get miles.,btohqsg
I rmb if u redeem miles to purchase ticket also don‚Äôt get miles for flying. üòÇ,btohqsg
Quick question:  need to spend 1k on my new amex card.   What are the easy spend I can do?  Grab top up don't count   insurance dont count.Surprised me that SPC patrol also do the count.   Ikea or ntuc vouchers will lose out on their discounts etc  right?,btohqsg
Card fees + another 1.5%? Or total 1.5%?Anyway still can use 4mpd cards like Uob visa signature.Do they allow splitting payment,btohqsg
See if cardup is included in spend then u can pay a fee to clock spending on your insurancr,btohqsg
