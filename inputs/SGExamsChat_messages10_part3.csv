Idk bro he probably had this thought inside him for a while and needed an outlet to get it out,btohqsg
Not every angry rant should be discredited for being an angry rant,btohqsg
Maybe because i can understand what he's saying and why  since I'm a retainee too,btohqsg
these are examples of what im referring to as condescending and shitty to say,btohqsg
These are things that people say to emphasise their point informally on the internet when they are angry,btohqsg
then i can randomly call someone a faggot too,btohqsg
itâ€™s the implication that OP is a piece of shit just cuz he didnt study his arse off that pisses me off,btohqsg
the original post was basically a melodrama to garner positive vibes and validation,btohqsg
den the response was exposing that,btohqsg
no he is a piece of shit cos he is insinuating other people are treating him like trash because of his bad grades and painting a false picture  when it in actuality its when OP didn't listen to good advice and went against it,btohqsg
that's why people treat him like garbage,btohqsg
only childish ppl treat ppl like trash for bad grades,btohqsg
if u followed the other guy's reddit posts (the one in the reply posted above)   hes lowkey flexing in most of his comments,btohqsg
the guy who wrecked the original post ah,btohqsg
maybe he is just super blunt,btohqsg
but nvm lah if we take just this post in isolation  his points still stand,btohqsg
i only agree with that reply post above,btohqsg
Blunt or not  there's this thing called1. being WRONG2. being rude3. doing illegal things.,btohqsg
cos the op is actually a lowkey flexer,btohqsg
otherwise  the yukeming guy is quite rude in other posts,btohqsg
its not a 'motivational' story if you are from an IP school,btohqsg
idk his other posts bro  im just stating his singular post in the pic above,btohqsg
exactly the point i stated before,btohqsg
post stated gpa in secondary school and i was life wtf since when secondary school got gpa,btohqsg
den i realized it was one of the elite schools lol,btohqsg
This is pretty biased too. I think it depends on how much you can acknowledge the playing field though.,btohqsg
if one has a chance to have access to papers created by these schools  you will realise why they are actually 'uniquely difficult' in their way as compared to most schs,btohqsg
Bruh. I went to NOT-RI and I could do RI papers,btohqsg
Difficult papers don't mean jack shit.,btohqsg
how is that biased  its like saying a rich kid has shit grades and if he succeeds its a motivational story,btohqsg
You can try for the ecole polytechnique IX entrance exams - not sure who's going to teach you how to do them  but most likely you'll do worse than other A-level students who just ...studied A-levels.,btohqsg
I already qualified it - it depends on whether the rich kid can acknowledge he or she has had a different environment.,btohqsg
in this case the rich kid didn't,btohqsg
it was the fault of the teachers  op parents  op cca commitments blah blah but not op,btohqsg
Hating on rich people donating to the poor  because of the notion that they robbed the poor in the first place isn't really going to convince the rich to help the poor. When the instance of help is concrete  you can't just say 'haha but all of your money is toxic and you probably wanted a lower tax bill',btohqsg
op's not at wrong for screwing up,btohqsg
that's different  in this case the help wasn't concrete,btohqsg
the post smelt more like some self validation post,btohqsg
All I'm saying is that opinions without sufficient context don't really make sense.,btohqsg
why are we even arguing over this  the person who complained about this post has disappeared,btohqsg
cos the moment her narrative got shattered she didn't dare to stand up for it,btohqsg
Well everyone has different capabilities. Doesn't mean you are not in an elite school means you are less smart etc.,btohqsg
just cuz i not here 24/7 to reply to people with no pfp and shitty nicknames,btohqsg
people got better things to do,btohqsg
no point  the topic has gone stale,btohqsg
The only thing that can be said is that possibly (I massively doubt it) is that RI papers have different pedagogical value to them. It's not about being hard - it's about whether after doing the paper  you learnt something out of doing it.,btohqsg
Well i agree with that. The paper actually forces ppl to think,btohqsg
if not for the fact im in a censored envt i'd roast u to death,btohqsg
i'll one up u on the offer,btohqsg
if u actually have a valid argument and roast me properly  i'll concede the loss :),btohqsg
