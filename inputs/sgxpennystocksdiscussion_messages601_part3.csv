Singapore’s Mega Oil Rig Builders Keppel  Sembcorp Marine Discuss Potential MergerBLOOMBERG $Keppel Corp(BN4.SI)Loh Chin Hua  chief executive officer of Keppel Corp.  right  speaks to the media during a briefing ... [+]Keppel Corp. and Sembcorp Marine on Thursday agreed to explore the possible merger of their offshore and marine (O&M) engineering services businesses.Combining the two companies—both controlled by Singapore state investment arm Temasek Holdings–will create a stronger entity that’s poised to benefit from the shift towards cleaner and renewable sources of energy  the companies said in a joint statement.“While the outlook for oil exploration and related activities remains uncertain  the outlook for energy transition is robust  including areas such as offshore wind and hydrogen ” according to the statement. The International Energy Agency recently forecast investments in clean energy to more than triple by 2030 to nearly $5 trillion per annum  it added.Keppel and Sembcorp Marine’s O&M businesses have been hard hit by the drastic reduction in oil and gas exploration activities in recent years as energy companies pivot towards the production of cleaner and renewable energy. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation  driving both companies into the red last year as oil demand and prices plunged.Under the memorandum of understanding signed by the two companies yesterday  Keppel and Sembcorp Marine will form an equally-owned joined venture company  which will be a listed entity. The transaction will be subject to the approval of shareholders and regulators,btohqsg
