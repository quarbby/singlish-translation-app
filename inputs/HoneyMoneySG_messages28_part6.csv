Hi all. Any comment on the POSB Everyday card? Been using it for quite a while.,btohqsg
I only find it useful for public transport rides with no min spend required  but even then SC Smart beats POSB Everyday at 6% cashback. The $800 min spend is too high for me,btohqsg
no min spend for posb everyday 5% for simplygo  7% for sheng siong  3% for watson  up to 5% for recurring utility etc,btohqsg
Thanks. My take is that I just want to be simple. Consolidating my expenses in a single card  accumulating n utilizing the rebates to offset my future purchases. Used it for iphone purchases previously with zero $ by offsetting n recontracting. It might cost a bit more but it's not affecting my monthly bills. Offsetting it for petrol purchases n even my motor insurance of late also seems a good deal for me.,btohqsg
To each our own. If you aren‚Äôt on the Trust ecosystem I think the  POSB everyday card is decent,btohqsg
So the $800 min spend applies to dining  online shopping and telco?,btohqsg
for those who is using uob one and yr quarter is oct to dec... have you received the quarterly cashback yet?,btohqsg
Hi which credit do you use for telco  electrical bills  settling of healthcare invoice? thank you :),btohqsg
do u know that quarterly cashback will only be credited if u have card bill to be offset,btohqsg
oh is it?.. so if jan no bill no credit? I thought it would be credited into the card acct,btohqsg
UOB Absolute gives 1.7% cashback for everything except grabpay top up (0.3%),btohqsg
yes can check their website  quite clear,btohqsg
Hi all  which is the best miles credit for petrol?,btohqsg
Was thinking of using the citi rewards master card w amaze. Would that give me the 4mpd? ü§î,btohqsg
Next  as I'll be buying lots of new appliances for my new house  I'm also looking for a credit card to earn miles for these purchases. My current card (HSBC Revolution) has a max limit of 1k for the 4mpd rewards,btohqsg
I didn't know UOB no longer have JCB cards...that means no good CC to use for JPN already?,btohqsg
Anyway UOB has horrible service so they are dead to me,btohqsg
correct me if i'm wrong but u wont get the 14% discount for citi cc on petrol?,btohqsg
Hmm not sure leh. I'm using my star rider account to get 20% off at caltex,btohqsg
