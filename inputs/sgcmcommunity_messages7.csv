Thank you! Deleted and banned the fella,btohqsg
Remember this ‚Äúpolicy position‚Äù : to make cars affordable but charge when the car is in use via ERP and potentially other pay per use systems ?,btohqsg
So that more pple can own cars  this was a common complaint among many,btohqsg
how often do you wash your car,btohqsg
Hi any bro can give insights will coe   will cat A be on rising trends. in deep consideration of getting a new car or 2nd hand car. calculated and it seems like the breakdown of mthly installments are not to far apart,btohqsg
My answer won't be accurate since it is not a daily driver. ü§£If I know I am keeping for long storage   I will wash before cover.,btohqsg
Probably won't drop for a few years,btohqsg
Don't hope to go down to 40k,btohqsg
? Sure not as often as u lah‚Ä¶. U have BMW M3 right?,btohqsg
I wash every Sunday   take it as an excerise,btohqsg
i got a deal for honda fit 1.30A   10yrs loan  1.98% interest   mthly about $1100 . really hesistating whether i shld pick up this deal. as my current job requires car.,btohqsg
Why not get a 2nd hand car and don‚Äôt pay 10 years loan,btohqsg
$132 k for a fit -.-,btohqsg
i was enquiring on swift 2nd hand 86k   2.48%   7 years left. calculated also about 1.2k . üò™,btohqsg
The Earliest it‚Äôll drop is 2024.,btohqsg
I think it will drop is 2030,btohqsg
it will nvr drop to 40k that level already right,btohqsg
As now ev gaining pace with rebate,btohqsg
A lot of new ev model coming and can see high demands,btohqsg
Very unlikely. Becox now you have EVs competing for Cat A. Which I feel it doenst make sense. But ya the silver lining is  hybrids are considered clean energy  and hence by 2040  it‚Äôll be the only ICE that is not phased out.,btohqsg
This was confirmed by LTA when I partipvatrd in the energy pillar forum held ytd with SMS Amy Khor,btohqsg
wisable to direct get a ev?,btohqsg
2030 no more ice coe lioa,btohqsg
I think for current environment if you can  you should. More future proof,btohqsg
Just look at pole star arf so low,btohqsg
If you really need a car for work even a Swift you can get for much cheaper than what you quoted earlierhttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=996791,btohqsg
Why still buy ice and pay so much arf,btohqsg
This is the standard range one right? Not the long range.,btohqsg
Compare the arf between swift and poke star and look at the omv,btohqsg
Pole star omv is 3 time plus higher but arf is only 1 k more   currently buying ice car is just a waste of money,btohqsg
Car is expensive is not only becuase of the coe is also of the arf,btohqsg
This is a 2nd hand polestar ah?,btohqsg
Go test drive   u won‚Äôt drive ice any more,btohqsg
Internal Combustion Engine (aka fuel engine)...But long long ago some refer ICE to be known as In-Car Entertainment for those in-car sound system..,btohqsg
i hardly wash. really. i drive once a week but i dont even wash it once a week. maybe like once a month,btohqsg
but i wash my mazda 6 often like once a week,btohqsg
i know. my next car is tesla,btohqsg
Model 3 performance or wise for model s plaid,btohqsg
Your maid dun wash for u?,btohqsg
m3 is money losing. mistake to have bought it,btohqsg
Ya I did. For this single motor alr quire fast. Impressed. But not impresssed by the price,btohqsg
Believe EV price will continue to downtrend as more people adopt it.,btohqsg
Now is I wish to change but the upfront cost is so unfair and nowhere near parity to ICE cars.,btohqsg
yea just need to wait. Early adopters usually pay more for this car revolution,btohqsg
Yeah  I guess they spend more time on the road so trade FE for less effort.,btohqsg
Actually is going up up up as ev is over demand and battery is very expensive especially for nickal,btohqsg
Actually u means 2 nd hand or ?,btohqsg
"Hey sgCarMart Community  I hope all of you had a great weekend!!ü•∞Remember to participate in our currentLiqui Moly Giveawayby simply answering ""What exactly is sgCarMart Quotz‚Äôs Sell-By-Bidding Services?ü§î"" in this poll and stand a chance to walk away with a Liqui Moly Bundle (Worth $76)ü•≥üö´Giveaway ends on 13th April  11.59pmüö´Good things don‚Äôt say we never jio you all horüòâ",btohqsg
There is Kona and byd that is cheap   polestar omv is around e class,btohqsg
Because of the early adoption incentive?,btohqsg
Yes 45 k rebate off arf,btohqsg
Yeah those 2 I felt wasn‚Äôt very suitable brcoz of my usage patterns. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of needing to Charge every 2-3 days.,btohqsg
So it means off purchase price,btohqsg
I like Polestar though. The build is good.,btohqsg
Ev is about charging on and off  a lot of pit stop if you don‚Äôt have a dedicated charger,btohqsg
Ya for now my prime choice is still Polestar or Tesla if possible.,btohqsg
I show u some thing more about the arf   u can see this is a tesla vs a bm 420 compare to omv and arf,btohqsg
Many stations in Johor. Safe to go la. Just don‚Äôt go to east coast,btohqsg
Aiya use wrong bmw should use 428 omvIs much higher,btohqsg
Free just need rm240 membership annually,btohqsg
When scrap car need to return the rebates correct? Are these already factored into the used cars depre in sgcarmart?,btohqsg
Ev is the way to go. No roadtax no import tax malaysia. Free,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt buy bmw man you‚Äôll regret. High running costs,btohqsg
Over price also and outdated liao,btohqsg
For the high end segment of 600 k car I will go for model s   no competition,btohqsg
EV is the way to use in Malaysia while charging is as good as free,btohqsg
Buy a condo in Malaysia to stay there and park a Tesla there‚Äôs,btohqsg
I know ppl go Malaysia for free charging haha,btohqsg
I'm selling 1.5 Jazz  7 years old. 60k km. Let me know if you are keen,btohqsg
Never say never ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ if need have to buy‚Ä¶.. at this kind of price levels  really no point to buy more luxury than necessary,btohqsg
Things to note if u get ev cars.1. Rebates alr taken off your scrap valve2. In the contract  does it state disposal fee for ev batt. Not talking about normal ice batt.3. Cost of changing ev batt,btohqsg
Guess the cost of ev batt,btohqsg
So unless ev has a 30-50k rebates. A ice engine is still the way to go,btohqsg
Human is always curious about new stuff. EV is the new hippie in the town. Once EV becomes the majority  ICE will become the hippie. Nothing can replace the sound from true ICE. Then when ICE becomes rarer  it will become the hippie.,btohqsg
I am thinking  there will be a major shift in workshop industry too. The ECU tuner  exhaust specialist will be exhausted and obselete.,btohqsg
This suddenly just came across my mind when I service my car by changing engine oil.,btohqsg
I also think it depends on the mindset of the automotive industry. If most are not receptive  the govt can do whatever to promote it  but there‚Äôll not be any momentum.Imagine workshop guys will say: Wa piang I need to re-learn all my knowledge on ICE to learn how to service EVs  I don‚Äôt want  waste money  etc.,btohqsg
then they become obsolete in the field. More unemployment   etc.,btohqsg
EV will definitely require less maintenance than ICE for sure.Battery replacement is probably controlled by the manufacturer like how apple controls the servicing of Iphones. (Right to repair *cough*),btohqsg
The problem is nothing to service   is only Changing of the 3 major parts   battery   motor and bms,btohqsg
The only that that need to service every 2 years is changing of brake fluid,btohqsg
Btw speaking for the case of Tesla  their battery pack is not so easy to repair apart from Tesla‚Äôs engineers because of the way the cars are built. I‚Äôve been through a talk by one of the industry experts on the Gigafactory manufacturing process and I can appreciate better why the repair right has to be only by them. I fully agree.,btohqsg
it would be money I as a consumer will be willing to pay.,btohqsg
And these will be controlled by manufacturer.,btohqsg
Yes even pi sent back the car to them for repair,btohqsg
Currently if u import In tesla your self   tesla will reject all services to you   means they won‚Äôt even repair your car,btohqsg
Yea. It is cute.50 years ago  car user manual guides the owner on how to do basic servicing  oil greases basic engine tuning (days of carburetors).Manual for new cars these days are more of how to operate the electronics and telling you not to drink the contents of a car battery.,btohqsg
I think is a good strategy,btohqsg
Yup in fact tesla also sell u wiper and aircon filter that you can diy yourself,btohqsg
Millions of Android users should delete these 11 apps after Google kicked them out of the Play Store - PhoneArenahttps://www.phonearena.com/news/millions-android-users-delete-apps-removed-from-google-play-store_id139477,btohqsg
Delete them if you have it,btohqsg
In the meantime e the workshops will chop us for another 10 years,btohqsg
still got 2 more years before my audi A3 hit 5 years ... hope COE dropped then .. got it when COE was 30 plusk,btohqsg
Just nice lor‚Ä¶. U will pay more than 100kNow:),btohqsg
Too cheap Audi is not good,btohqsg
i got it during the covid period ..lol,btohqsg
When ev totally takes over. Even a mazda3 becomes a vintage. What workshop in further be doing will be curb repair change headlight. That's about it.,btohqsg
Yup the 3 door 323 ‚Ä¶. Anymore left? Last time soMany,btohqsg
Yes EV will take over ‚Ä¶ then the battery and the Chip always have to change one‚Ä¶,btohqsg
But no choice cos ICE will be no more‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Last time Mazda have a lot of stylish cars,btohqsg
One thing Mazda dun do is put turbo inside their car,btohqsg
Have ah‚Ä¶ the 2.3 MPS and of course the rotary,btohqsg
Just dun know why they dun put into their current sedans,btohqsg
Mazda only the mazda 6 wagon is attractive but the road tax is crazy,btohqsg
mazda is always stylish. most beautiful japanese cars even better looking than many germans,btohqsg
Japanese latest cx8 also got turbo,btohqsg
Mazdaspeed 3 and Mazdaspeed 6 too!,btohqsg
No turbo  some mz3 drivers already driving like crazy‚Ä¶ put turbo  hai de liao,btohqsg
U are quite biased towards Mazda:),btohqsg
if you read reviews  almost all say mazda is stylish. not just me,btohqsg
I say Honda is the best drive but u say it‚Äôs Mazda,btohqsg
It‚Äôs no dispute Hondas NA engines are the best,btohqsg
maybe with their type r vtec. but in termns of looks  honda aint there,btohqsg
So is it Mazda drives better than a Honda?,btohqsg
if you compare say honda accord and a mazda 6  mazda 6 is better.if you say honda civic type r and mazda ? no comparison,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶ u really super pro mazda,btohqsg
but mazda mx5 is world fasmous in driving enjoyment and fun. honda doesnt have any like that,btohqsg
Sure bo  accord vs mazda 6?,btohqsg
of course bro  no body likes cvt,btohqsg
but i like honda civic type r. this mazda doesnt have,btohqsg
exactlky. and mazda follows european tradtions. only automatics. never cvt,btohqsg
the old honda s2000 is the one that rivals closely with mazda mx5,btohqsg
but too bad honda doesnt have any successor for this s2000. and s2000 has become a collector,btohqsg
on balance for production cars for the masses  mazda does look more stylish than other equivalents. cx50 mazda 3 6 etc,btohqsg
So who‚Äôs the winner in this review? Thanks,btohqsg
i tested the mazda 6 gvc. it really is good. very sporty drive too for a big car with skyactiv engine,btohqsg
I think also not comparable cos s2000 is more expensive,btohqsg
Anyway I do agree that Mazda is a good üöó!!!,btohqsg
of course now it has become. in the 2004   honda s2000 was cheap,btohqsg
When it was cheap still more ex than the mx5 rite,btohqsg
the interior quality of mazda is also of higher grade than honda.,btohqsg
This one I dare not say‚Ä¶.. maybe the rest of the chat can comment,btohqsg
kodo design mazda. mazda 3 6 even the small 2.,btohqsg
For the same cat  the Honda is always the most expensive among the Japanese and u say the Mazda quality is better,btohqsg
Mazda is like an undervalued stock,btohqsg
mazda is a small company and always not selling well. resale etc. if you put this aside and compare  the quality is really better.,btohqsg
But good that there are still a lot of ppl who do not think highly of mazda  so I can buy mazda cheaper,btohqsg
that is why it is worth getting a used mazda. like undervalued stock. many would use second hand value to buy and pick toyota.,btohqsg
Not anymore lah‚Ä¶ now the japs are all ex,btohqsg
exactly. exactly. i bought second had,btohqsg
Not just japs  korean cars are ex too,btohqsg
But Koreans have improved a lot,btohqsg
but used mazda 6 is cheap,btohqsg
But is not China brand mah:),btohqsg
many who test mazda find it good and but would eventually be influenced by friends saying - aiya why mazda  no resale value  get toyota la - kind of argument,btohqsg
Is Mazda resale value so bad? I dun think so lah:)),btohqsg
I bought mz3 instead of Altis  cuz mz3 was cheaper‚Ä¶ so if u tell me resale value‚Ä¶ buy low  sell low‚Ä¶,btohqsg
it is like alfa  such a wonderful good car i have a lot of expereince owning and driving it. so economical in fuel consumption too. but many wont even want to go near,btohqsg
I bought new‚Ä¶ but I bought at low coe  and good price,btohqsg
great choice. i started with mazda 3 and i liked it. but i dont like the speedo with digital tach. and when i saw the 6 there is no turning back,btohqsg
Even the current one  I also bought at good price,btohqsg
mazda. not sought after. great. keep prices low. but it is a fantastic good car.,btohqsg
Ur hud is the flip up one or the windscreen type,btohqsg
flip up type HUD. but the latest 3 has the screen type. damn posh,btohqsg
Yes.. u will love the windscreen kind,btohqsg
And mazda is still produced in Japan,btohqsg
yeah the flip type is not so good. old model,btohqsg
do you know website to check chassis number of mazda,btohqsg
this is autonomous driving mazda lane following,btohqsg
the fuel economy i cant believe it. more than 800km,btohqsg
no. this is lane departure warning with hands off. i drive without hands.,btohqsg
"it lets me do this for roughly 30 seconds. and then warn me of ""Please hold your steering wheel"" warning and then disables it",btohqsg
so whenver it veers to the lane markings it will auto correct to stay in lane,btohqsg
i like the fuel economy with istop,btohqsg
damn good getting 13 km/l to 14,btohqsg
A lot of mazda owners do not like it,btohqsg
For me‚Ä¶ i just leave it‚Ä¶ but I never depress my brake fully‚Ä¶ so seldom activate it,btohqsg
i know. it is made for us to use. why disable it thnking it will be bad for starters,btohqsg
it is like when wifi is there turning it on will shorten the life of battery kind of logic,btohqsg
i do that too. when traffic stop longer i press fully brake to stop engine,btohqsg
"https://youtu.be/76xUE9T3fOMsee conclusion -  reviewer says ""mazda 3 wins hands down""",btohqsg
mazda even the smallest 2 is fun. no CVT.https://youtu.be/Fcpvxtkgojs,btohqsg
Isn't coe already capped in terms of number available. Sales won't drop  just go to the highest bidder,btohqsg
Maybe the demand will drop since it would be cheaper to take grab/taxi than owning a car ..,btohqsg
Ya but obviously less coe less sales think that's what the author is saying,btohqsg
Salesman eat grass. Better pivot be 2nd hand car salesman  customers all there,btohqsg
They say Less Registration lor. They just have to increase the COE more until only maybe Ministers can afford so it will drop to all time low as well LOL,btohqsg
less new sales = more ppl paying pqp to renew coe lo,btohqsg
I went showroom last Saturday  so empty as compare to previously,btohqsg
Toyota sales person told my friend that she zero sales for 2 months already ..,btohqsg
It is those PHV companies that are pushing up prices. Individual buyers will have to think twice about car purchases for the time being.,btohqsg
Those PIs offering those 0% DP and PHV schemes,btohqsg
Ad also price too high la,btohqsg
I believe COE system could be more transparent like highlighting the names of those who bid. That could be more convincing,btohqsg
What the point when goverment already wanted car lite society   and now with ev arf rebate they will need cover some how some where,btohqsg
Grab also increase in prices taxi also,btohqsg
Bus and MRT as well also increased. But they say Fuel Tax is to subsidised all these,btohqsg
Toyota zero sales is get ready to pack Liao,btohqsg
"ofc... that's the ultimate goal lah. Essentially  they are increasing the entry to barrier to own vehicles. I mean... one of the contributors are private car dealers. If the dealers want to play their game legally well i.e. according to MAS' guidelines  dealers can choose to remove zero down payment schemes thereby making ppl consider the financial upfront costs more when considering cars procurement. Let's face it  even myself gets tempted when i see car promos that say ""zero DP""It's just a workable hypothesis so pls dont hit me haha",btohqsg
But Beware‚Ä¶.. really must ge careful of PIs,btohqsg
Nowadays ppl getting smarter and smarter   they will always look like for the best deal .,btohqsg
1) maybe the cars not here yet so not registered yet‚Ä¶2) all COEs taken right? So A no sales means customers at B?,btohqsg
Gg I hope these salespeople don't have 1 month notice and can fl,btohqsg
FL? Salesman pay less than 1k right?,btohqsg
If they poot them  will they get the Comm from the previous sales? Maybe those 2-3 months ago,btohqsg
0% down payment is actually very lucrative for the car dealer   as buyer is paying 10 years of high interest.,btohqsg
Yup  that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a loophole.,btohqsg
Ask any car dealer they wish every 1 buy using 0 dp and 10 years loan so they can have maximum return of referral,btohqsg
Agreed think that's attractive during low interest scenarios,btohqsg
The issue is not about loophole is when u add up these 10 years how much u are over paying u will feel u are dumb,btohqsg
more shift to B and luxury cars. if u can afford 200k  20k difference is less drastic than a lowest price cat A hatchback,btohqsg
I bought a car using 10 years loan with no dp   at the 9th year when I scrap my car I need to top up 34 k,btohqsg
Actually I think MAS is aware of this loophole but they are closing one eye on this as the government is still the ultimate winner when COE rise. Haha,btohqsg
Wa no one buy urus wor haha,btohqsg
And trust me this is a social problem when a lot of ppl take this scheme and default payment,btohqsg
How come need top up sia,btohqsg
0% down   full loan is Ballon scheme   so u if your car is 100 k they mark up to 130 k and loan u 130 k and the intreast chargr is base on 130 k,btohqsg
I think it could be the case of lease to own? Low DP but high interests,btohqsg
Cannot cao interests one‚Ä¶ even one settles the settlement earlier during the 10 years loan period.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a social problem  it‚Äôs the problem of the borrower only,btohqsg
so example by right your car is 100k  u pay 40% down is loan 60k  and for 5 years  but if i take the full loan  the down payment is 0 but i loan 130k and loan for 10 yearsso scenario 1 i loan 60k and 5 years intreast of 1.48%scenario 2 is 130k loan for 10 years  and at 2.8% intreastscenario 2 my intreast for 10 years is at 36440 compare to 1 at $4200 intreast for 5 yearsu see the intreast  difference  that why pi will always push for full loan,btohqsg
For those who want to see,btohqsg
I last time young and stupid fall into the trap hehe,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt said la haha but is common,btohqsg
U just need to do the maths yourself and u know u are dumb haha,btohqsg
LOL... next time buy car bring accountant count for u LOL Wont get scammed,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHAH the interest is really cui max,btohqsg
It a very simple thing   the more u loan and the more years u loan the higher is the intreast,btohqsg
And for such high loan the intreast rate is also easily twice more then normal,btohqsg
But for ur case is legitly alot more OMG. the intrest u paid can pay for my COE still have Kopi lui sia,btohqsg
No leh I think standard   I know a guy buy a Camry using this full loan and paying 230k for it over 10 years   and that is like 2 years ago lol,btohqsg
I wonder how much those SE earns for selling a car. LOL,btohqsg
But i tot loan is bank earn?,btohqsg
car earn little is the fianance earn a pile of gold,btohqsg
Will have referral fee 1 ma haha,btohqsg
at the end of the day how many % of people got 40k cash on hand,btohqsg
Then have to buy coe car or don‚Äôt buy car le,btohqsg
even if interest higher people will still go for it,btohqsg
Why pay so much more ? I also regret when young   the money use for holiday   investment is way bette,btohqsg
"it's common practice now. u search google for ""0 down payment car""  few minutes later your facebook ads will be full of these dealers offering $0 downpayment cars",btohqsg
dealer can finance inhouse as well. i loan u$Xat Y% interest.,btohqsg
Compare the 2 pic u know I know,btohqsg
Cause they want earn the intreast and bank won‚Äôt do full loan,btohqsg
yup. bank regulated by MAS too. have to assess your income  and can only loan 60% for OMV>20k (most cars),btohqsg
Absolutely. That‚Äôs why I said in singapore but used car.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a cost component. Get a good reliable used car.,btohqsg
govt imposed strict downpayment requirements that would have moderated COE prices significantly  but all these in house loans supporting near zero DP car loans effectively bypassed the restrictions. So you can partially blame these trigger happy buyers for high COE prices,btohqsg
My first two cars were new. I was greenhorn. I lost 50% after 4 years.,btohqsg
True .. the inhouse one is earn Big Bucks LOL,btohqsg
which cars? certain cars can still hold value,btohqsg
Aiya.. mas can pass new laws  financial institutions can find ways to by pass it.,btohqsg
When was COE invented by who ah? Previously was No 10yrs Shit one right?,btohqsg
My plan is simple. I will buy a Tesla in malaysia. Tax free usage free. And buy a condo to park it there.,btohqsg
Abs use it there. In Malaysia there‚Äôs no limit to how long you can keep. You can keep forever.,btohqsg
Depent u buy what model and from who like e300 dealer earn u 100 k   the depreciation sure is high ma,btohqsg
early 90s i think. And if we did not have COE  we would be like jakarta now. 3 hours traffic jam will be the norm,btohqsg
AllCars can‚Äôt hold value. They‚Äôre costs,btohqsg
Make costs lower by owning used ones .,btohqsg
I mean tbh even without COE lol. Car prices are still HIGH End lor,btohqsg
exactly. even with coe at times also cte jam for hours. no coe the car is even more useless,btohqsg
COE is a hard cap mah. so the population can never go beyond that amount ,btohqsg
Put money in money making instruments.,btohqsg
If we minimize PHVs? Really alot lol 9/10 on the road at anytime LOL. And drive like hamilton Shiok i dun see F1 have signal de,btohqsg
Yes the pot of gold is here  then they tell y give u 10 year servicing   the laught untill can‚Äôt when u think is a good deal . Car cost 20 k omv I earn u 100 k u still think good deal,btohqsg
COE is a necessary evil. We hate to pay for it  but there is no alternative to capping vehicle population. the only debatable thing is how do we assign coes to people fairly. govt chooses a bidding system,btohqsg
Hey I owned Mazda for 3 months already. What‚Äôs the serving cost like,btohqsg
Gonna do in Malaysia Jb cheaper?,btohqsg
Come to think of it servicing may cost low for some car types or brands. So 10yr is really not much on their end especially they have inhouse WS also LOL,btohqsg
Sure earn method. Bidding lea LOL smart moves. Come again which person invented this HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I show u some thing   to explain free servicing come from where   u actually paid for it and loan is charging u intreast,btohqsg
ya normal lor. everything is included,btohqsg
How often should Tesla be serviced? What‚Äôs involved in ‚Äúservicing‚Äù,btohqsg
same as ev rebates. everything already calculated in the cost,btohqsg
WA tesla really put their terms and conditions intoplay LOL! Fair Play LOL!!!,btohqsg
Ev rebate is less of arf tax what are you even taking,btohqsg
U will be surprised. Electronics all over. anytime anything will fail. They call it Wear and Tear LOL. Usually play with words. So yepps,btohqsg
10 k rotate tyre   20 k change aircon filter   and brake fluid 30 k change wiper,btohqsg
arf tax controlled by who?i put tax at 140k then i give you 40k rebate in the end i still get 100k revenue,btohqsg
We talking about pi and dealer   u talk about goverment for what,btohqsg
next time i increase rebate to 50k  then tax increase to 150k,btohqsg
Now all cars are mainly electronic la,btohqsg
ü§î so what‚Äôs the cost like,btohqsg
Mostly just the routineTyre rotateBrake fluid checks12V battery replacementsBrake padsTyre change.Battery I imagine every few years only.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know leh haha cause ev only got a few parts To maintain haha,btohqsg
Very difficult to say probably as stated below. For such cars confirm wont be as cheap as well. I guess,btohqsg
Then this is morning. I can do these myself. Except setting electronics stuff.,btohqsg
Malaysians import these without caring much about maintenance.,btohqsg
Get it first and then do it later,btohqsg
If software update can be done over the air much like iOS,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs Tesla  the software is via OTA,btohqsg
So barring major problems really nothing much,btohqsg
I only able to find this and the others are all under warrantyService IntervalsYour vehicle should generally be serviced on an as-needed basis. However  Tesla recommends the following maintenance items and intervals  as applicable to your vehicle  to ensure continued reliability and efficiency of your Model 3.Brake fluid health check every 2 years (replace if necessary).A/C desiccant bag replacement every 6 years.Cabin air filter replacement every 2 years.Clean and lubricate brake calipers every year or 12 500 miles (20 000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during winterRotate tires every 6 250 miles (10 000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5 mm) or greater  whichever comes first,btohqsg
So just tether to your wifi and update.,btohqsg
Wa piang the cabin filter every 2Nyears then change?,btohqsg
Service must be cheap. Otherwise defeats purpose of having ev. Okay next car Tesla.,btohqsg
Just order online they sent to your home and can diy,btohqsg
I repair my manual clutch pumps myself I changed them. Master and slave cylinders of clutch,btohqsg
I never rotate my tires. That‚Äôs text books stuff,btohqsg
companies that buy S plate cars shouldnt be allowed to join us in the usual CATs. they should have a join taxis,btohqsg
The main issue with ev is safety. Batteries that can catch fire. Scary. Like bolts,btohqsg
Or over charging that kind of thing,btohqsg
Avoid owning a car wherever possible. If you don‚Äôt really need to use it don‚Äôt buy it,btohqsg
Unless you need to commute between singapore malaysia,btohqsg
Insane to own 100k coe car,btohqsg
Cheaper.... But if biang u gg,btohqsg
Pi servicing can be change oil only also counts as servicing. Ad is a lot more expensive but they have an extensive list of what they will chfck and replace. In fact  best case is to find the AD list of checks then bring to your own workshop,btohqsg
I get my workshop to list the break down of the checks done,btohqsg
True enough but would they be transparent? They could tell u 30pts check but how detailed ? LOL. Stand there and see how they check? Hmmm,btohqsg
How much is a oil service in Mazda singapore,btohqsg
more than $200 per service.. suggest u go for outside workshop if your warranty ended..,btohqsg
Some are unnecessary to me  unless getting 2nd hand car.Than again  things/parts spoil anytime. But that's another story,btohqsg
Now what era liao   give them car keys plug in to computer can see everything lioa haha,btohqsg
I mean the checks they have done lea. How to confirm ? LOL,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know I only know I go ad change oil is 500 plus sgd,btohqsg
If the difference is not much just let Mazda do,btohqsg
The 100points check  I wasn‚Äôt really sure if they really check,btohqsg
I‚Äôm doing it in Mazda JB,btohqsg
Of course they would la. You got to give them the benefit of being professional they‚Äôre authorized dealer,btohqsg
Fastest service ever! 60500km expensive or cheap?,btohqsg
Never before I experienced it so fast,btohqsg
That oil systems cleaner is rip off. They never asked me. I would never do that. This is a daily driver and cleaner ain‚Äôt necessary at all. They just wanted to make extra profit s,btohqsg
Still cheaper in a way =D Enjoy the RM,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a lot cheaper in KL,btohqsg
If I take away the oil systems cleaner should be less than 400,btohqsg
Good to know but need to drive all the way in LOL,btohqsg
Dunno about other car but for BMW brought in sg can go malaysia to do servicing they honor it,btohqsg
Sure. Not KL. But to do in JB is good. It‚Äôs authorized maDa dealer. They sell Mazda cars,btohqsg
Yes. Likewise malaysian bmws can also go to singapore,btohqsg
Heard many car showroom empty or little sales,btohqsg
Second hand car sales shooting up .,btohqsg

Be careful. Do not go to ksl to park your car there. Catalytic converts stolen,btohqsg
Avoid places where many sinkies go,btohqsg

HUH Can steal one ah? LOL,btohqsg
They cut out to sell. Just like in America. Precious metals inside,btohqsg
but if you park at a lot with many other cars around blocking,btohqsg
they have no space to jack your cat,btohqsg

yup  my experience is good so far. mall parking just park where theres lots of cars. outdoor i will park where i can roughly see my car and theres streetlights,btohqsg
Abit worrying cause so many negative remarks on missing stuff etc robbery ... scary sia. Really.Just curious what car go in cfm kena such issue nia ><,btohqsg

Last time go in dun need think all these i feel msia better already lah. U do all these steering lock all ur car most likely kena from all these cause they know u hiding sth,btohqsg
True also. I think those that kena rob or what is go in alot of cash show off or accidentally shown to those Pirates then kena de. If not why bother rob the car sia,btohqsg

Anyone using covered by carro insurance?,btohqsg
Would like to ask if the shell fuel voucher rebates are stackable,btohqsg
No. That‚Äôs old era thinking. Todays cars have automatic steering lock,btohqsg
I never bothered to buy additional gadgets.,btohqsg
Now i curious Steering Lock automatic and Manual de lol what difference?,btohqsg
But i always twist to lock it before i leave,btohqsg
Just be low profile. Don‚Äôt go there shouting why so cheap wah Lau eh why so Ulu kind of loud talk,btohqsg
Thats why i always tell friends pls keep to yourself just pay. Its only when we convert it looks cheaper but if u earning there and paying that also not cheap at all,btohqsg
that is not era problem. just an extra step on top of auto steering lock.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs redundant. Todays alarm system and safety equipment is adequate.,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt drive off the car so easily without your key electronics. System will shutdown after some distance,btohqsg
But be wary of catalytic theft. It‚Äôs real. They‚Äôll saw off the cat,btohqsg
totally wrong. there are high tech thief out there to steal ur car fob signal. once they duplicate the signal  they can drive off within 30 sec.,btohqsg

"""To date  car manufacturers have yet to find a foolproof solution to beat these car thieves "" the ADAC findings concluded.A police spokesman said they were aware of this high-tech method.""Car owners should take extra precautions like installing GPS tracking devices or use steering or gear locks to deter thieves "" he said.He added that keyless entry was impressive  but nothing beats a good physical lock  which made it much harder for thieves.",btohqsg
Change steering wheel to Quick Release as well =D,btohqsg
ya. this one works too. üòÇ,btohqsg
My friend did so. We parked He take it out and ask me take with US LOL ! I was like WT? LOL...,btohqsg
Any form of alarm  immobiliser or extra lock is a form of delay/deterrence. The goals are simply to1. Make the perp think it ain't worth his time.2. Scare off the perp.3. Slow down the perp.4. Attract attention to the deed.They're not going to stop the car from being taken by a skilled or desperate thief.,btohqsg
A mechanical secret kill switch is a simple and highly effective way to safeguard your car.No spark = no startNo fuel = no start,btohqsg
It works on all cars and makes  including older cars where the locks are definitely not as secure.Cut off battery power is the simplest.,btohqsg
install GPS and disable engine when GPS tells you car is stolen. sort of like findmyiphone kind of thing to immobilize it.,btohqsg
another way is to remove fuel pump fuse and ignition switch fuse.,btohqsg

I dun know why the bikes must always be so close to the cars,btohqsg
The engine oil seems expensive.  If they allow you to byo that will be ideal and bring down a big portion of the cost,btohqsg
Actually ah I always thot the Highway Code says the bike is supposed to stay in the middle of the lane right? And act like they are one unit (like a car),btohqsg
They skilled to pass thru mah. But if they accidentally hit us or scratch us how ah? I scared one lea and always like that i sometimes close up the gap lah. If not They will pass thru like their road,btohqsg
Cars always lose one in such cases. Unless got eye witness to help,btohqsg
They will be squeezed and maybe fall down and report‚Ä¶. I will be haul to court‚Ä¶..and I lose my job,btohqsg

no. m3 i dont do it myself i have the real old 1990 e30 m40 engine i do it myself. very easy and all manual,btohqsg
this one nobody wants to do outside because they think it is a waste of time. so unloved,btohqsg
but it is the most fun car to drive. feels like a small m3,btohqsg
i can repair this CAR MYSELF . simple things. brake pads change oil  oil bleeding  change etc,btohqsg
You can get a five litres of Motul for your bmw servicing at about 60sgd.,btohqsg
I guess this workshop will not allow u to bring ur own EO,btohqsg
yeah for my bmw i use my own oil castrol edge 0w30,btohqsg
i bought some tools i do this myself  brake,btohqsg
foir the old car  i do DIY  like changing master clutch cylinder.,btohqsg
back breaking work due to constrained space.  the old bmw parts are cheap to buy,btohqsg
You are really a hands-on !,btohqsg
i got no choice. because no workshops like to spend time on old cars.,btohqsg
fortunately it aint hard to do,btohqsg
I am looking for a good service workshop in Johor to service my brother F10.   Any recommendation you have will be good üëç,btohqsg
E30 is still a good car ...,btohqsg
you know many talk about changing brake fluid clutch fluid etc right after so many years etc. not true at all. i do not lose fluids at all nor efficiency. even after 5 years. it is that good dot 4,btohqsg
the master clutch cylinder failed as it is losing pressure not due to leaks but due to rubber seal inside giving way causing no pressure when  you press pedal.,btohqsg
that is why i am keeping. 3 years later becomes classic status,btohqsg
F10 mst be very expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
Yes .... but prepare for leaks ...,btohqsg
leaks is internal; piston seal leaks,btohqsg
and the slave cylinder cosst like $30 only,btohqsg
It get a lot of engine oil leak.... I change the gasket.... ATF.... etc .... endless...,btohqsg
need to get rid of this ride..... spending too much time to maintain it,btohqsg
that is a headache. can be cranksfat side rubber seal leaks there too,btohqsg
haha that is why i never like to drive bmw. expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
that's why the m3 i do it once a week to hear up engine oil and internals only. mistake,btohqsg
what good is a car if expenisve to run,btohqsg
bro  get rid of bmw. serious  get mazda,btohqsg
cheap to run. this should be the way,btohqsg
Define expensive.Why not  if owner is comfortable.Than get one that is suitable for you,btohqsg
i did buy a mazda 6 that i use daily and super happy with it,btohqsg
bmw demands too much of my time to take care,btohqsg
Was interesting in Mazda from the earlier debate.... Getting a car may not be a good idea since COE is too high,btohqsg
Depends on your spending power. Some higher than others so people's comfort level vary greatly.,btohqsg
not just money. with frequent things that need replacement.,btohqsg
on balance  it is not as reliable as japanese,btohqsg
People can afford more time than others too. To be honest there is just too many factors to say what is the best cause every owner  spending power and time to do things to the car  vary.,btohqsg
Which also in the end cost money..,btohqsg
simple repairs i watched youtube to follow,btohqsg
It's always ppl who didn't own a Conti that will make this comment.It's ok  I have ppl in the bike community saying this on Italian bikes too.Anyway  I mean it's good to know how much one can afford too.One thing to share is  there's only problematic owner  nvr the vehicle.,btohqsg
so vehicle is never the problem?,btohqsg
hello. i have alwasy owned continental cars. alfaromeo  bmws  and 2022 a mazda 6,btohqsg
i know more continental cars than many of you who may not own so long,btohqsg
and i can share all these expereinces more than anyone when compared with what i have gone through. every repair and service i have a journal to record eveything,btohqsg
I go your house do tyre rotation,btohqsg
So you spent a fair amount of time at workshop as compared to Jap car?All brand new cars?,btohqsg
3 years leak black oil liao,btohqsg
i have owned all continental cars except the mazda,btohqsg
therefore i think i know what i am talking about,btohqsg
this is not an attack on bmw car owners or continental car owners. i just say it the way it is. because i also own bmws since 2004,btohqsg
End of the day it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs own choice on how to spend their money and time. As long as they are happy with what they have. Different cars cater to different wants  needs and pocket size,btohqsg
if enjoyment is upr uppermost prioprity and you do not mind the time and money spent on maintenance then okay.,btohqsg
for instance  many are surprised why i keep the e30 so long. i got these questions asked all the time. can you still get parts? get you still service it? wont it break down etc? and i drive the car to phuket,btohqsg
that is a big amount of time spent to maintain well,btohqsg

yes. more time spent in workshop for bmw cars than japanese cars all things being equal.,btohqsg
i floor the car but i dont jackrabbit tires.,btohqsg
i am supposec to change tires. kumho ps91 good tires? i saw this on audi rs,btohqsg
I floor at red light everytime,btohqsg
Some time at high way also,btohqsg
burns rubber i very seldom do,btohqsg
Kumho tyres are generally good and durable  perhaps slightly noisy,btohqsg
good value for money i think,btohqsg
used to be cheap and good,btohqsg
I agree! The noise on rough roads drives me nuts. Do you happen to know any tyres that arent as noisy,btohqsg
good but expensive tires on my m3,btohqsg
but on my mazda i want a change to less expenisve ones,btohqsg
I‚Äôm riding on Goodyear Efficient Performance Grip 2 (EGP2) right now. I find it very good  especially during rainy days,btohqsg
Previously I was on Kumho Ecsta HS51 for a very long time,btohqsg
Generally I think the price reasonable  I got mine at around $130 / piece. Mine is 225/45 17,btohqsg
It‚Äôs cheaper than Michelin and other higher end brands,btohqsg
Generally Goodyear tyres are equally reputable as well. In my opinion. Slightly more budget friendly,btohqsg
You can check some of the tyres out here for their verdicts,btohqsg
And the sidewall is not exactly ugly eitherüòÇ,btohqsg
would like to seek opinion from the experts here - my COE vios is left with about 1 year but it's time to change tyre.. Should I go for 2nd hand tyres (nexen  kumho etc.) or tourador? haha.,btohqsg
what about the road noise? how bad is it,btohqsg
no. dont ever settle for used tires. dangerous and not safe. i had this ugly expericen way back in 2008 in malaysia when i had second hand tires. one tire exploded on my bmw. fortunatelky not driving fast,btohqsg
I think road noise is acceptable for me  as compared to Kumho. It is quiet enough for me,btohqsg
just buy new but inexpensive brand,btohqsg
Yes bro  avoid getting used tyres. You can look for newer but inexpensive ones. For 1 year or so usage  I think brand new Tourador would be good,btohqsg
Cause some people haven kena after saying so loud before the msians. Not nice to hear as well.,btohqsg
You go hermes shop buy stuffs also shout everything cheap,btohqsg
Saw one E36 on sale...but timed with 5 year COE. quite sad.,btohqsg
e36 aint so famous. or so not worth keeping. but yeah it is hard decision due to high coe,btohqsg
it is all luck. that i paid low coe,btohqsg
i saw one e30 coupe! this is a rare one. if you see it follow him and make him offer to buy. a collector,btohqsg
e30 manual i think probably less than 5?,btohqsg
i ran till like that i didn tknow... lol,btohqsg
luckily found out in 2013. toyo t1r,btohqsg
How come E30 is valued but not E36 ah?,btohqsg
"iut is more ""original"" for enthusiasts. and today many collectors all over the world are crazy about e30. but e30 is a better car. they say the 36 body strucutres not so strong. the rear top mounts cracks",btohqsg
the fun factor is higher in the e30. i thougoughly love it which is why i dont sell. many have asked me. some strangers come up to me,btohqsg
incredibly easy to maintain. which is why i can repair it myself. not engine repair,btohqsg
cheap to repair too. demands a lot of time.,btohqsg
labour cost in SG is expensive üòÖ,btohqsg
yeah. but they dont want to do. old car demands time. they prefer to do something easier and quicker to collect money,btohqsg
that is why i end up having to repair it myself,btohqsg
this car is incredibly enjoyable. the balance of bmw is great  the braking,btohqsg
even in malaysia  not many want to do it like in jb. kl has many shops,btohqsg
Repair car take too much time change part is fast and good money and no warrently issue,btohqsg
major problem of e30 is rust,btohqsg
floor panels rusty on driver side,btohqsg
malaysina e30s are worst. locally assembled. rusts in the engine compartments. battery panels. the singapore made in germany ones are much better,btohqsg
have you seen cracks like this?,btohqsg
Hi guys would like to ask why sometimes my kia cerato forte 2009 model will have this weird sound like blue sg cars from the engine bay especially when accelerate,btohqsg
No vibration sounds tho sounds more like a blue sg electric carüòÖ,btohqsg
My guess will be your radiator fan,btohqsg
Ahh but its sometimes tho.. like switch off engine and on back its okay already,btohqsg
It didn't happen just when you turn on Aircon right?,btohqsg
More like the sound will appear halfway during the drive,btohqsg
My best guess should be radiator fan. But take my guess as a pinch of salt as I aren't expert in this. Especially when my car has no radiator. ü§£,btohqsg
Ah alright! Thanks for the help tho,btohqsg
No use guessing go ws and take a look before things get worse,btohqsg

Is this like a leasing contract?,btohqsg
i dont know  didnt contact them,btohqsg
if base on 10 years loan with the dp  u are paying like 200k for an avente,btohqsg
Some people dont realised cause mthly is comfortable to them just pay only to drive,btohqsg
true that... just pay and dont think.,btohqsg
but the issue with lease to own is that it gets fussy when it comes to decision that requires ownership approval i.e. like choosing of insurance provider/scheme and workshop if one gets into an accident,btohqsg
because technically one is leasing to own so the ownership is technically under a company and not the driver  per say.,btohqsg
lease to own dun need think about anything pay 1 amt and only care about 3 things1. Season Parking2. Cash CArd3. Petrol/EV ChargingThats all mostly,btohqsg
That's a good version of a lease to own scheme. The one that i previously kena also even requires the owner (me) to cover road tax and insurance premium.,btohqsg
Insurance should be tagged to company so NCD under them . Not too sure about this lease to own.,btohqsg
WTH? Last time GLA got lease to own. At $1 900/mth all covered LOL. But i think terms and condition wise. Hmmmmm,btohqsg
i know right.... that's a painful lesson. Hence  i would advise all to cautiously read through all the T&Cs before signing on the dotted line.,btohqsg

dont think so. these are made in thailand,btohqsg
nah not true. mazda is very fuel saving. for a big car it has the economy of a toyota vios i can vouch that since i drove vios 1.5 before that,btohqsg
I mean I bought like within 3 months window,btohqsg
stay with japanese cars. much better,btohqsg
i owned bmws i know. i compare,btohqsg
If Altis was cheaper than mazda3  then I would have bought Altis,btohqsg
