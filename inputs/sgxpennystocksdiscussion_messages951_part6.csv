"💰Love Me Not Market💰Markets are shuffling around in the prelude to a slew of earnings from mega-tech firms. The DJIA rose by about 100 points in the morning  only to see it fade and  at one point  fall by 300 points. Then came the volatile rebound  and the day ended by dropping 0.1%.We saw similar behaviour in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq  which ended relatively flat for the day.This comes as market participants prepare for heavy doses of economic data (FOMC  Jobs data) and significant earnings from Microsoft Meta Platforms  Apple and Amazon.We saw how the market was spooked by Alphabet's higher-than-expected spending on AI as part of its expansive capital expenditures.Things are shaping up to be a tightrope walk  as any gain is often fading  like the ""air pockets"" discussed by Pika Nat.Back soon again  Jordan.",btohqsg
