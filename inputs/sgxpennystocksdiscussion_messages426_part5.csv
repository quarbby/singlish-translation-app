When benitez at Reign.. Valencia ish keyi one,btohqsg
Real Madrid very hard to get in.  U must be a damm good player and must be yandao,btohqsg

First season bring loserfool to champ glory lor,btohqsg
EPL player go RM got anyone perform meh. apart from Beckham,btohqsg
Bale lor in first few yrs,btohqsg
Actually Bale play good la.. The media condemned him nia,btohqsg
The Spanish media damn cb one,btohqsg
messi vs him is like talent vs hardwork,btohqsg
Very good liao...consistent like David silva,btohqsg
Owen go there also like floppy disk,btohqsg
Notch bad but their expectation too higj,btohqsg
Even van nisterooy got condemned there,btohqsg
This week so fun. La Liga winner decided on last game. French league too,btohqsg
Casillas also got condemned liao.. Lj club la real madrid,btohqsg
Show em psg money doesnt always buy trophies,btohqsg
Wa lao u live in the past lor hakan sukur,btohqsg

That era football is the best lor,btohqsg
Tinkin to hoot eth around 2,btohqsg
Got people bet s league uh?,btohqsg
Hougang 1x2 odds look good  but if got handicap shld try HG handicap,btohqsg
Best is buy FT Over goals lor,btohqsg
Lionel Tan today cannot play cos suspension. HG back line may be weak. Plus Boris quite zai,btohqsg
Must show all my seiyuus equal love,btohqsg
Now I addicted to Date Sayuri lor :(,btohqsg
Hougang actually play not bad on artificial grass also. Can take that into consideration.,btohqsg
Anyway I say say only ah. Lose liao don't take parang find me,btohqsg
Young lions sometimes siao siao one,btohqsg
Last wk their match against Albi I watched. Their defence quite solid,btohqsg
Also because Tsuboi subbed off due to injury la,btohqsg
But donno whether LCS can hantam them today or not. Hariss shld be in liao  so maybe the LCS midfield can venture further forward and whack kitties 9696,btohqsg
Maybe can whack FT Over and LCS handicap... Or FT Over and hedge w Kitties eat ball...,btohqsg
wah i not expert in sinkie league leh  must ask Inori,btohqsg
Sinkie league hard to play one honest,btohqsg
my style is just buy 5mins before closing  see which one likely is bookies side and whack,btohqsg
For me I just buy FT Over usually,btohqsg
Cos SPL defence quite jialat across the board except for Albi,btohqsg
i gave up with all the fundamental sh*t. waste time reading team/players news,btohqsg
Don't gamble is the best ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Last time I whack gaogao HG v TPU. in the end 3-3 draw.....,btohqsg
That one the HG GK mukun 2nd goal anyhow concede. See alr nearly want to punch my laptop,btohqsg
Got ah. Sometimes can guess which one high chance win,btohqsg
SPL exists for the sole purpose of betting... Sad to say,btohqsg
But now w LCS and further privatisation efforts hope the league can be even more exciting,btohqsg
SG is not short of cash..,btohqsg
