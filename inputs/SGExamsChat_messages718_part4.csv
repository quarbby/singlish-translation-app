Then show it in the grades given,btohqsg
its cuz i can tell one whole essay (the 28/50 one) was chatGPT generated because of the examples,btohqsg
For example  coral reefs in the Caribbean have been experiencing significant degradation due to a combination of factors  including climate change  pollution  overfishing  and coastal development. As coral reefs decline  the loss of habitat and food sources has profound consequences for the diverse marine life that depends on these ecosystems  including parrotfish. Coral reefs support diverse ecosystems that provide food for parrotfish. Declines in coral cover result in reduced availability of algae and other food sources for parrotfish  leading to malnutrition and decreased fitness. These parrotfish may eventually die as it is not receiving enough food to survive. Furthermore  the parrotfish are preyed upon by various predators  including larger fish  sharks  and marine mammals. As coral reefs degrade and parrotfish populations decline  predation pressure may increase  further exacerbating population declines. The depletion of coral reefs meant that the parrotfishâ€™s lives were endangered. This could eventually lead to extinction of coral reefs and parrotfish if this continues. Predators that prey on parrotfish may see a decrease in food sources and this affects the whole food chain  causing them to disappear one at a time. Another example is the golden toad (Incilius periglenes) and its specialised predator  the Monteverde harlequin frog. Both species were native to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. The Monteverde harlequin frog relied on the golden toad as a primary food source  and its population dynamics were closely linked to the abundance of golden toads. With the extinction of the golden toad  the Monteverde harlequin frog lost its main prey species  leading to declines in its own population. The species are heavily dependent on one another  directly or indirectly,btohqsg
Wanted to beat the high score,btohqsg
i gave 16 for content cuz some parts were still like,btohqsg
and just cuz the example is chatgpt generated doesnt mean i can mark it wrong,btohqsg
its a full on nat geographic article abt,btohqsg
okay gd thing the student is not in here,btohqsg
okay tbf it used to be worse,btohqsg
last time she wrote a whole ass article on how polar bears are going extinct,btohqsg

Bud didn't even fucking try to arrange it neatly to make it look slightly more convincing,btohqsg
Is okie means I've got a chance,btohqsg
i gone back to plugging in gp essays into chatGPT,btohqsg
btw ChatGPT gave that essay a 42/50,btohqsg
In the end  what does that kinda imply LMAO lol the sch you come from eh maybe doesn't matter but ig at times like that it just seems debatable,btohqsg
ofc only one example but like knn,btohqsg
Idk if it's just me but tbvh it's kinda funny that they're in such schs in the first place ðŸ˜ƒ uh man fr press F for doubt,btohqsg
"pls lor i got RI student write for me before""Different arts got different meaning because different arts are different technically complex. Because different forms of arts have different levels of technically complex  they have different meaning.""",btohqsg
sch doesnt matter if ur student produces,btohqsg
what kind of content do you want in gp essays lol,btohqsg
chatgpt can do better then this,btohqsg
Iâ€™m actually concerned what if I legit ditch my coding mod and canâ€™t even get D to S it  what if I grad with U,btohqsg
I actually wun mark ChatGPT work,btohqsg
I will throw back to the student,btohqsg
do you need to pass it to fulfil grad requirements,btohqsg
I dun think can grad with U right,btohqsg
There is a S there is a U so idk lol,btohqsg
It is very easy to tell ChatGPT work except if there is a right or wrong answer,btohqsg
it was written by a hci student,btohqsg
but i can tell its ChatGPT work,btohqsg
like itll be it can do these things such as XXX YYY ZZZ,btohqsg
ChatGPT did not exist back when I was in Jc,btohqsg
so u see like the combination of factors  including climate change  pollution  overfishing...,btohqsg
Canâ€™t believe so fast things have changed,btohqsg
? Idt you get the pt,btohqsg
i do not give GP tuition,btohqsg
my english third language student managed to get a C for GP,btohqsg
pay not for GP tuition but for GP criticism,btohqsg
Meanwhile the English first language gets U,btohqsg
I feel like tdy my attention and productivity is really low,btohqsg
