Planning to cancel my dbs altitude card. I wonder if cancelation of this card would lead to auto cancelation of the Priority Pass card. Please advise  thank you.,btohqsg

Anyone tried using amaze+ OCBC titanium onAmazon.com? Can get 4MPD?,btohqsg
Hi any advice on the better miles card Iâ€™m still deciding between DBS altitude or Citi premier miles,btohqsg
No only krisflyer or Cathay pacific asiamiles,btohqsg
Better to go for 4mpd cards rather than these two. But if I were to pick between these two I prefer dbs altitude which can pool points with dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Ohh thanks! Iâ€™m looking at the initial sign up bonus points too,btohqsg

Hi  may I check if yall happen to know the MCC for yoga packages purchased via online? Considering the card to use e.g. Citibank Rewards/HSBC Revolution. Otherwise probably will do Grabpay + UOB absolute,btohqsg
Best to call the yoga studio to check their MCC then cross check with the bankâ€™s list to see if it counts.,btohqsg
Hi all  I've been trying to find out if the UOB One card is entitled to 3% cashback for travel bookings to no avail. Is anyone able to confirm that travel bookings are not considered retail spend and therefore not entitled to 3% cashback? My alternative is the AMEX + GPMC combo,btohqsg
Happy new year guys.Thank you for all the help and guidance.,btohqsg
