Oh cool  thanks!I suppose the key is at least maintain the same amount during the few years of waiting for flat completion,btohqsg
you can write in and they will tell you the same thingIâ€™m a student now while my partner is working. It doesnâ€™t make sense for our loan quantum to remain the same 5 years from now when we collect our keys,btohqsg
yea thatâ€™s the main thing to keep in mind,btohqsg
I can understand if HDB makes exceptions for couples like you and your partner since one of you is not in the workforce yetYou guys could even do staggered downpayment if that is a more comfy arrangementBut are the same allowances made for applicants who have been working for some time?,btohqsg
As long as thereâ€™s significant income change  the loan quantum will change,btohqsg
but if youâ€™d like some confirmation  just give their hotline a call,btohqsg
Nope  ha haWill prefer them to answer in black and white,btohqsg
Probably i will ask some people who had collected their keys recentlyMore similar profile... Non newbies in the workforce ðŸ¥²Thanks  anyway!,btohqsg
Do you mind sharing the query that you sent?So that i can understand their written response in the correct context? Thanks,btohqsg
Thanks admin whoever you are haha,btohqsg
If income stays the same when during key collection  loan won't change? Is it possible that it will be lesser since age up another year? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
No if income no change don't need to reassess. You'll get the same loan,btohqsg
Oh really .. I remember the officer told me may reduce because of age also.. ðŸ˜­ I was like huh but income same wor. 2 years late got difference meh ..,btohqsg
Hmm... you might wanna write into get it in writing...,btohqsg
Cos we loose the total number of months of official earnings age ...I guess only hah,btohqsg

Yes that's what she meant... years for repayment got lesser... ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Shouldn't they have factored it in based on when the loan is disbursed? ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg
