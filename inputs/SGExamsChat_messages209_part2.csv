Can ask A Maths and POA  which one is easier?,btohqsg
I didn’t take POA  so no comments,btohqsg
Anyone took POA? Any comments on the subject?,btohqsg
U need a lot of practice,btohqsg
To see where u went wrg when u cant balance,btohqsg
Both equally easy and if you are a language person go for poa and if you are a math person go for amath,btohqsg
Piracy streaming sites are your friends,btohqsg
Poa is easy if you put in effort to memorise the different formats and theories. Amath is easy if you practice lots of math qns.,btohqsg
If you deciding between the two to see which subj to take  I recommened taking Amath if you intend to go sci stream in JC with H2 math.,btohqsg
I use this for Doctor Who and Supernatural,btohqsg
Anybody know any agencies to find part time jobs in?,btohqsg
Jobstreet jobscentral jobsbank recruitexpress adecco ackermanglobalsearch kellyservices tempserve,btohqsg
If any1 here was from EJC and took H2 Chem (Current JC2 A lvl or graduated)  do pm me. Thanks!,btohqsg
I have pure science but don’t have A maths does it mean I cannot Ho to science stream in JC?,btohqsg
idk ah but safe safe for non amath student is h1 math lor,btohqsg
unless they have that bridging session or wtv it is,btohqsg
H2 math is possible for lower tier jcs without amath if emath is A1,btohqsg
But to be honest H2 Math statistics section does rlly require A mathBut the pure math part of h2 math requires A LOT OF A MATH,btohqsg
I don't think its advisable unless u can learn some of the A math syb on ur own first,btohqsg
But i still did ok for h2 math,btohqsg
Ya. It just requires a good gc really,btohqsg
I dont rly think one is at a disadvantage much without it,btohqsg
Its just like how someone takin combined sci wants to take h2 chem,btohqsg
If my course in Uni does not require H2 Maths can I just take H2 sciences but without h2 maths?,btohqsg
I have pure science for Sec but without a maths,btohqsg
I thought u must take a maths if u take pure science?,btohqsg
H2 chem and comb chem much larger than e math to h2 math imo,btohqsg
The former has a lot more diff,btohqsg
H2 math is basically e math at a lvls,btohqsg
Cos u studied the syllabus alr what,btohqsg
And H2 F math is A math at a levels,btohqsg
But comb phy to H2 phy,btohqsg
Doesnt matter cos its gonna be covered again,btohqsg
Since O level phy has its similarities with H2 Phy,btohqsg
I think combined to H2.. learning curve v steep,btohqsg
My classmates struggled  very painful watchin them,btohqsg
But the reverse is also true,btohqsg
The first few topics on dynamics yes,btohqsg
