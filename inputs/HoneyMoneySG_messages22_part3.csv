Hare the current lucky dip... Everytime after use  no luck. Grap point very low compared to last time.,btohqsg
Ah  it's complicated.- Apple Pay contactless payment at bags  shoes and clothes merchants = 10X points- Apple Pay for in-app payments e.g. on Kris+ = 1X points,btohqsg
quick questionlow spenders like us do we go for cashback or miles game?monthly about 400++ or lower,btohqsg
Not miles. You won't be able to amass a critical mass of miles to redeem a good value tix. Cashback have to be careful of min spends  so best to go with a cashback card that has 0 min spend.,btohqsg
I think even if don't top up 100k  will still qualify for the prevailing esaver promo up to 31 Jan. Also  esaver usually refresh the promo every 2 months,btohqsg
From now till 31 January 2023  earn up to 3.80% p.a. interest on eligible deposit balance of S$2 million with no lock-in period when you bring in incremental fresh funds* (compared to November 2022 average daily balance),btohqsg
Quoted from SC website regarding esaver,btohqsg
so cashback would be a better choice for me?,btohqsg
Yup. But of course go for a cashback card with low or 0 min spend requirements.,btohqsg
Unless go for no/long miles expire such as hsbc revo or dbs altitude,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. Cashback more for normal spender.,btohqsg
how about citi rewards with amaze?,btohqsg
cause im in betweenciti rewards with amaze or hsbc revo,btohqsg
any input will be helpful for me thanks guys~,btohqsg
anybody knows a way to get grab wallet $$ out of grab?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is a no brainer lazy card if don't want monitors mucho,btohqsg
try the bigpay method doesn't work  try topup to youtrip doesn't work also  in the past top up to youtrip work.,btohqsg
Just use and tap to pay lor,btohqsg
U can still transfer if u top up by debit I recalledCredit card top up most of the hacks grab already removed,btohqsg
haha actually is the $ i top up previously  wanted to get it out now since grab point is like no point these days/,btohqsg
but yea i use uob absolute  thus now cant get it out.,btohqsg
Now after they nerf it's too late,btohqsg
but i guess i just use it for insurance purpose.,btohqsg
Better use while it. Can 2023 maybe have more nerf,btohqsg
It's high time to look for a replacement,btohqsg
shag  im just using citipay all for 2mpd and amaze plus citi reward.,btohqsg
Amazed dont be amazed when it's nerfed,btohqsg
is UOB Absolute still worth to hold on after the nerf?,btohqsg
thought holding alot credit card is bad ?,btohqsg
i got HSBC  Citi cashback+ and rewards  UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Slowly they won't waive fee u auto will reduce,btohqsg
Citi die die dun1 u cancel card de,btohqsg
I got 3 citi  hsbc  spree & unlimited(which I lazy to cancel n auto wavier fee  same for spree)  everyday card  uob one. Uob absoluteAnd other digital bank/wallet cards,btohqsg
I find optimal is like 3-4  you wont regularly use beyond that number,btohqsg
wah then the points kind of gg,btohqsg
Main is citi cashback. Oh n ocbc frank. Uob absolute(switch to spree maybe) n uob one.,btohqsg
U know whether membership got excluded from uob one 500 spending?,btohqsg
anyone knows if Citi would waive 2 credit card annual fee? i know that DBS will only waive 1 card every year for free,btohqsg
I think UOB Absolute can be like maybe a backup card after you have max out your monthly benefits for the rest of the cards.,btohqsg
depends on if u want cashback or miles  i always go for citi premier miles.,btohqsg
clock your 500 at uob one  for 7.8pa  1k at citi reward  the rest just zam on premier miles,btohqsg
Yeah my first choice would be UOB One probably ard 1000 then Iâ€™ll move on to CRMC.If I go beyond CRMC 1k  that would likely mean I overspent for the month already. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Citi wavie as many as u like,btohqsg
My cards like from 8 yrs till now,btohqsg
Most card is able to get free waiver from my experience  just do via chatbot or call in and talk to robot. but must let them charge u first lah lolol.,btohqsg
i heard ocbc credit card is hard to waiver the fee.,btohqsg
Never had an issue for me. Most is sc the rest is relatively ok,btohqsg
I see youtrip now also accepts visa  can hsbc revolution card be any use?,btohqsg
hi roughly when will tbill result be out,btohqsg
you can topup youtrip with hsbc revolution but will not get any points,btohqsg
