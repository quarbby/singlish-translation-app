i feel like we‚Äôre completely missing smth lol,btohqsg
I dont think N is 0   cause A + E = AWhich means E has to be 0,btohqsg
ok if we say 0 in front isn‚Äôt acceptable and every single letter is a one digit number,btohqsg
if 0 is acceptable i think there‚Äôs multiple solutions?,btohqsg
i mean AN x AN ending with AN means like,btohqsg
Cause the qn said ‚Äúall letters represent diff digits‚Äù,btohqsg
yeah   i mean 1 letter = 1 number   that ranges from 0-9,btohqsg
might as well just put NEE,btohqsg
i not enough brain cells for this,btohqsg

Wthhh i understand nothibg frm this qn,btohqsg
when in doubt be a ckw,btohqsg

i tried to put in in Microsoft math solver but all it gave me was algebra,btohqsg

hotel is just for me to sleep,btohqsg
most of the time i‚Äôd be out,btohqsg
fly overseas to do ‚Ä¶ staycation :/,btohqsg
Why not stay in Singapore and extend the staycation with the money for the flight?,btohqsg
Where you wanna go overseas for the staycation?,btohqsg
eh i can see it still as a getaway breather from your usual environment,btohqsg
idt staying in sg would work if i wanna do that,btohqsg
Maybe staying at Club Med better?,btohqsg
the mention of club med unlocked childhood memories of mine lol,btohqsg
More to offer than a luxury hotel I think,btohqsg
depends on the hotel bc if it‚Äôs the resort kind then can be quite insane,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs just like one building,btohqsg
Cant give good advice if you want to gain muscle for the gym,btohqsg
But if you want to just gain weight in general just eat macdonald fries burger and coke for all meals + 125% sugar bbt everyday,btohqsg
doesn‚Äôt actually work for some people,btohqsg
Why U overdo it liddat sia,btohqsg
i mean you spam meat your metabolic rate gonna spike also,btohqsg
Never give time for muscle recovery,btohqsg
just don‚Äôt overdo with any one muscle group,btohqsg

"You're still in the "" mug mug no bitches "" mode",btohqsg

Dawg I wish I started gym again,btohqsg
The one time I went gym was last year,btohqsg
Today the other interns ordered bbt,btohqsg
then one guy told the others that 0% sugar bbt isnt w/o sugar its js they dont add extra sugar cause the tea itself alr has sugar in it,btohqsg
i mean i do push pull legs push pull legs then rest then repeat,btohqsg
got some bravo kids throw vegetables at  us,btohqsg
i did b4. uk those brown sugar pearl. damn sweet sia nvr again,btohqsg

Imagine those living in tamp back then hearing about that now,btohqsg
actually ignore me lol tjc is the one shifted not vjc,btohqsg
rather tjc may have less competition since it is now closer to tmjc but since their cops are quite far apart  it may not have a significant impact on tjc‚Äôs cop. rather  vjc‚Äôs cop may drop since bedok now only has 1 jc in the area,btohqsg
but this is only one factor la haha. cant tell how it will actually be until 1 feb,btohqsg
Oh fuck I should have gone into tjc campus during its open house,btohqsg
