return of y¬≤ = f(x) curves from pre 2017,btohqsg
the physics spreadsheet thing is interesting,btohqsg
Honestly this is probably for the best ,btohqsg
idk what that‚Äôs about exactly actually,btohqsg
I find it an essential topic to teach,btohqsg
but I'm still re reading infinite square potential well for the new syllabus,btohqsg
oh yea this is wild but i like it lmao,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt h2 math a preparation of the math that most degrees will use in uni?,btohqsg
What are the uses of complex outside of eee and some niche physics,btohqsg
"True  but I think polar form will actually ""complete"" the learning",btohqsg
don't think h2 needs complex numbers for the analysis.,btohqsg
I agree too but for most ppl it isn‚Äôt super duper relevant,btohqsg
wait do students need to know what a wavefunction is idr,btohqsg
It‚Äôs kinda like how I think they should teach analysis in jc to get a complete view of calc but it wouldn‚Äôt be relevant to most,btohqsg
complex analysis is a completely different ballgame than polar form,btohqsg
It's always about training the analytical skills and not just the technical skills,btohqsg
I don't see the Excel parts lol,btohqsg
for eg I send my kids to art classes not for them to excel in art,btohqsg
real analysis isformalizationof calculus to me,btohqsg
Agreed but can‚Äôt tht be trained in other ways while also tackling the former? More efficient that way no?,btohqsg
it was just some memorisation notes,btohqsg
Yeah in a way wouldn‚Äôt that ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù it  idk,btohqsg
not niche physics btw just physics as a whole at uni level has quite a lot of it,btohqsg
Oh like for heat and shit?,btohqsg
Economics will not have polar form,btohqsg
Economics is complex enoughNo need complex numbers,btohqsg
I have a friend who specializes in HEP & QM,btohqsg
I see a lot of polar form and stuff in his work,btohqsg
i say that because specialising in QM is like saying i specialise in calculus,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a fundamental part of it,btohqsg
ahhh  what's the Spreadsheet/Excel things about in the Paper 4 ah?I don't see anything out of the norm.Seems like regular data collection from Practical?,btohqsg
well he mainly does HEP is what I can say,btohqsg
Wait didn‚Äôt u just finish Os how are u meeting these ppl wtf,btohqsg
don't fully understand why they need it yet  when GC can replicate,btohqsg
what a waste. Easiest to score,btohqsg
I systemised my methods + finished up 120 pages of self study examples.This year J2s final year to use üò≠,btohqsg
just write rebrand the book and sell it for the International Syllabus lol,btohqsg
We still have Paper 5 Planning. lel,btohqsg
different. International one is much easier,btohqsg
got reference better than nothing la haha,btohqsg
then need to rewrite it also,btohqsg
"It says ""may"" means not really technically required also lol.",btohqsg
The exam paper now looks like Cambridge International exam paper,btohqsg
"got ""instructions"" and ""info. to candidates""",btohqsg
Most of SEAB papers are Colabs with Cambridge throughout 2000s.When Singapore using their own syllabus.I always find the papers nearly identical ü§£,btohqsg
just that Singapore ones tends to kills more brain cells when answering.,btohqsg
This part (v) you know how to answer already? haha,btohqsg
for the (v) - to support your relationship in (iii)Most likely you found your percentage uncertainty.Then  comment like the greenbox saying it is less than 10% to 20% percentage uncertainty. Then free 1 mark ü§£,btohqsg
yes  very standard question every year,btohqsg
I see. This I have no clue about since I don't have access to purchase the Practical paper. ü§£,btohqsg
