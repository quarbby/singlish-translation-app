It's too different from pure history,btohqsg
For a sec I tot this was fking gp,btohqsg
For some reason cambridge hasn't tested IR qns in the past 2 years,btohqsg

"On today's episode of dumb things in gp essay""Singapore society is not perfect because we ignore racism""",btohqsg
You dumbass ltr some bolio create new acc and copy everything nia,btohqsg
wait im getting a jeadache from reading gp essays,btohqsg
wait the logic of this whole argument doesnt make sense,btohqsg
"""Singapore is obsessed with perfection because we ignore issues in our society.""",btohqsg
oh ya random but if instead of saying he swear at her  can I say he splurted expletives at her,btohqsg
the qn is to what extent is your society obsessed with perfection,btohqsg
this is a classic example of a SJW twisting the qn to talk abt shit she cares abt,btohqsg
"because her argument answers the qn ""Twe is singapore a perfect society""",btohqsg
isn't that gone case alr uh,btohqsg
like i can still salvage it,btohqsg
cuz her first 2 paragraphs atq,btohqsg
bruh there's a reason y my rpt is 91,btohqsg
and not send me shit like this,btohqsg
not everyone godly like you mah,btohqsg
as my english cher always says ''i vomited blood while marking your essay'',btohqsg
Oh ya also I only learn AQ this year  that's why idt my essay is that structured yet??,btohqsg
Like the one I send u,btohqsg
but schs like to teach them like they are not,btohqsg
i can see the link  but i wanna clarify what you mean,btohqsg
cuz fundamentally you dont need a 12/12 for AQ to get an A for GP,btohqsg
so schools teach the bare minimum to get a 7,btohqsg
what did I mean ? ðŸ¤“,btohqsg
i cant even get a 7,btohqsg
oh I'll keep that in mind,btohqsg
most people dont get more than 5 for AQ,btohqsg
hm are AQ that hard to write,btohqsg
My first class which I taught got an average of 3/10 for AQ,btohqsg
cuz their cher taught them all the wrong shit,btohqsg
then it became 6.8/10 for MYEs,btohqsg
all i remember is i wrote 1st paragraph then eventually i lost track of what i am supposed to write but i knew i just had to keep writing,btohqsg
UK now is out of 12,btohqsg
because then more students would actually do well,btohqsg
last time they compressed too many students into the same band,btohqsg
so u had a shit ton of students getting 4-5/10,btohqsg
Me LOL literally me last year eoy promos,btohqsg
