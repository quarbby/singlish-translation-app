the kind of measures they go just to save a few $$. seriously,btohqsg
How do you ride with the bags spilling out like that? Elastic band?,btohqsg
Ya man. Tbh he was v smart  initial job wrote serangoon rd - somerset - great world city - bukit panjang so nobody wanted to take,btohqsg
Then he cancelled  booked another one as serangoon rd - somerset,btohqsg
And called to change it back to 3 stops lol,btohqsg
I dont  it fits in my bag. i have a huge bag  but if it exceeds the size limit for bike orders it isnt fair that we only get paid that much,btohqsg
Cant rmb the name  103 syed alwi,btohqsg
That's not being smart. That's being cunning,btohqsg
Plus he refused to let me load the bags myself. Just shoved them all in zz,btohqsg

Contacted cs and they just copy paste black and white,btohqsg
I mean they should seriously consider charging senders more if the location is a mall man,btohqsg
