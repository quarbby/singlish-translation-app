do you guys think is acceptable for a j1 to date a sec 4,btohqsg
but both need to give and take,btohqsg
Thats a given for any rs,btohqsg
Honestly the age distinction thing is mainly there to prevent a issue of mismatched power dynamics because in general those who are older know more or have more power in terms of authority,btohqsg
"A woman who claimed to be a deity and forced some of her followers to eat human faeces has been sentenced to 10 years and 6 months' jail.She ordered them to perform acts of ""worship"" by buying houses and cars  and pocketed over $7 million.https://str.sg/v6QP",btohqsg

I saw someone ask a girl if she'd rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or Drake and she said the bear cause she's 16,btohqsg
I thought I kenna deja vu,btohqsg
This one is quite ex tho,btohqsg
But its mostly snake oil to me lol,btohqsg
Mainly cus of R and D and its a relatively niche market,btohqsg
they‚Äôre mainly for musicians and audio engineers,btohqsg
Some ppl can hear the diff i cant rly tbh,btohqsg
Its mostly sounds diff to me tbh not strictly better than those under 50,btohqsg
on stage they come with a transmitter and receiver,btohqsg
Do they sound diff to u?,btohqsg
I wld keep my money for something else,btohqsg
Idk if its cus my years of q tip use destroyed my eardrums or smth,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a range i would be willing to pay for,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a want not a need,btohqsg
Are they strictly better to u,btohqsg
generally yes. it‚Äôs not like the more you pay = better but for a higher level of quality  there‚Äôs a higher average price point,btohqsg
also depends on what stuff you listen to,btohqsg
or what you use them for,btohqsg
Ye i get theres definitely diminishing returns past a price point but to me like past 50 or smth its just eh to me,btohqsg
Just dont have the ears for it ig lol,btohqsg
that‚Äôs fine if it doesn‚Äôt matter to you,btohqsg
some people use a wooden stool as a chair. i pay more of one bc it makes a difference to me,btohqsg
A chair u can definitely feel the tangible difference,btohqsg
I feel like any1 can understand it for a chair,btohqsg
yea bc a bad chair is obviously harmful but the same logic applies to anything functional,btohqsg
Gonna need to wait a goddam week for the nippers to arrive,btohqsg
duh she on world tour now,btohqsg
Maybe if i go study music instead  i will be more successful,btohqsg
I heard she caught a big tuna in hokkaido,btohqsg
As aespa said only if you see her at sold-out shows,btohqsg
Anyone wants tixs to my world tour in japan,btohqsg
Could only see em at sold-out shows truly manifested,btohqsg
It doesnt cover air tickets unfortunately,btohqsg
Also 4 words summons lestin. Aespa  Stayc  Kpop and bad grades,btohqsg
youve never met me but yet you know me better than some friends i have,btohqsg
Well technically we have met. We just didn't know.,btohqsg
Idk if I can bid for mods,btohqsg
Would be funny to do so,btohqsg
Come with me. Aespa is doing it in Macau too there's RV too,btohqsg
is it too late to apply for LOA,btohqsg
There's Gidle as well if u wan the deal to be sweeter,btohqsg
Just say mental health leave :D,btohqsg
All groups of which ive attended (or going to attend) concerts for,btohqsg
Y2S2 has killed me  pls grant mental health leave,btohqsg
but you won‚Äôt get to be taught by me,btohqsg
Can I get taught by you if I use my BDE?,btohqsg
You need to take a prereq,btohqsg
Why cannot just leeroy Jenkins in,btohqsg
It is a mod which is also compulsory for physics minors :D,btohqsg
I am assuming he teaches 3101?,btohqsg
tbh more importantly is linear algebra,btohqsg
Is the applied or physics track more popular?,btohqsg
but his batch specifically a lot of pure,btohqsg
I would say more compared to last few batches,btohqsg
Hmm I would assume applied more cuz more industrial applications so more marni,btohqsg
Tbh I was quite surprised more ppl chose pure,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs the perception usually and pure is seen as more theory so more for those interested in academia,btohqsg
but the difference isn‚Äôt that big between the two,btohqsg
Plus they have more stuff for the applied side,btohqsg
And also 2nd major in quantum tech,btohqsg
I mean what did I expect every mod for the Minor is a physics mod,btohqsg
Yall don't have interdisciplinary or like common mods between SPMS or like NTU meh,btohqsg
Yeah rn I shopping for options I officially a Second Major in Philo liao but sianz as it will take all my BDE,btohqsg
I mean like for Minors and majors itself,btohqsg
Ps0001 and ps0002 are coding mods done with math and chem students,btohqsg
Cuz I surprisingly can probably map out a Minor in AI as there are CoHASS mods there,btohqsg
Currently I am doing a math minor :/,btohqsg
No CoHASS mods tho :( I need em to double count,btohqsg
U did the double count stonks too for your minor,btohqsg
Or u legit 15 AU BDE,btohqsg
6 Au => 7 AU from my double count,btohqsg
9au I did 1 3 au mod and 1 4 au mod,btohqsg
Yeah also.. u know u can SU rite?,btohqsg
Assuming u haven't yet for the 9au,btohqsg
Yea. I did that for MH1301,btohqsg
Which was the 3 au mod,btohqsg
They only allow s/u 6 au for minor,btohqsg
Ok what u left 1 more SU,btohqsg
Coming sem that mod u can just SU that,btohqsg
Cus the 3au mods in math,btohqsg
So i eyeing for that specific level 3 mod,btohqsg
U got enough BDEs to buffer?,btohqsg
Also it will mess up your Max load too,btohqsg
I havent used any for my mpes,btohqsg
At yr 3...we still have cores...,btohqsg
I plan to do my Y3 core concurrent with Y2,btohqsg
I would have loved to do that,btohqsg
Problem .... too many mods have too many pre req,btohqsg
For CoHASS cuz of our interdisciplinary minors there's always a backdoor,btohqsg
Use that as prerequisite replacement register as BDE then request for reclassification,btohqsg
not necessarily  a good thing  but something nonetheless,btohqsg
bringing a bear into your room cuz ure 16?,btohqsg
This gives me a headache watching it,btohqsg
Please learn the real japanese accent,btohqsg
y u so obsessed at thia kind of thing,btohqsg

thanks jun wei   senpai and musician jiejie üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
hi guys  do shops that clean phones (like dirt stuck in the speaker holes  etc.) exist?,btohqsg
frfrkudasailike pls shut up  i don't get the hype,btohqsg

My cores are literally 5 courses,btohqsg
Rest transferred to my MPE load,btohqsg
But she is getting so many people at her meet n greet‚Ä¶i seriously dun get it,btohqsg
It is just pure annoying to me,btohqsg
Hi my bachelor spec is quantum techDk wtf i did tbh :D,btohqsg
Idk keep popping up on my feed,btohqsg
Man the stories our taxi uncles must have to tell,btohqsg
I want to send me testimonial here for feedback but i scared ltr doxxed,btohqsg
Apparently its supposed to come with our o lvl cert?,btohqsg
Cant i just make my own testimonial later on,btohqsg
And just ask them to sign it,btohqsg
This one is the one where you have to write down like all your achievements is it ,btohqsg
And then the cher had to write their own ver,btohqsg
The cher was so vague abt it,btohqsg
I tot testimonial is ur teacher/mentor write,btohqsg
This one is we write and they validate ig?,btohqsg
O level it was my teacher write iirc,btohqsg
A level i had to write it myself,btohqsg
Did they just write it for everyone and send out tgt or smth,btohqsg
Our cher wantes us to write ourselves cus they might not know our other activities,btohqsg
But i feel like its more like a resume/cv then instead of a testimonial,btohqsg
I somehow had a third page for my jc cca like list looking thing,btohqsg
a lvl i had to survive myself,btohqsg
he went to make iced milo,btohqsg
u got a no aircon room,btohqsg
Different as in  i dont have to maintain a bajillion ccas to get a hall room,btohqsg
I remembered hving to ask for it,btohqsg
i dont study in pulau ntu,btohqsg
Different as in at least we have hot hideout,btohqsg
at least our buses are better than ntu,btohqsg
Ok it has its similarities but testimonial usually focus on stuff like CCA / extra-curricular activities and VIA + some qualities shown through these activitiesWhile CV focuses on ur education bg  ur work experience  leadership,btohqsg
Tokyo drifting buses? Nah ill pass,btohqsg
better than having to run for ur buses all the time or risk waiting forever,btohqsg
The whole thing u write urself?,btohqsg
aint no way am i sweating balls to get to class,btohqsg
Mine is the teacher ask us log into the sch system to write the activities we participate / what we want them write  then they write in para for us,btohqsg
Oh that is pretty sweet leh,btohqsg
Sorry all classes are recorded  no difference if im physically there or not lmao,btohqsg
I remembered the teacher keep reminding us to write coz ltr they really nth to write in the testimonial,btohqsg
"write "" i cannot last for 15 min in this hot weather""",btohqsg
But i cannot concentrate watching the recording,btohqsg
Me neither thats why i never watch them,btohqsg
And i dont turn up for class either,btohqsg
So you can guess how bad my grades are üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I had a boo boo incident with japan buses,btohqsg
Ye ik but our cher is calling writing about our achievements and stuff as a testimonial?,btohqsg
but no time also never mind,btohqsg
That is what it is‚Ä¶ur resume wun hv that much space on this + in future ur resume will focus on ur work experience + leadership,btohqsg
Depends on whether ur cher wants to write for u if u dun,btohqsg
This is our cher wan us write,btohqsg
the cher write for me one HAHAHAH,btohqsg
For now its useless to me  exceot for dsa that 1 i need write a seperate thing,btohqsg
Still haven started on it lol,btohqsg
Dsa just go find ur cca cher,btohqsg
But for me she just past me a form to fill up my activities related to my dsa applications,btohqsg
But the wordings is the teacher write for me one,btohqsg
I only got participation for their one lol,btohqsg
Im not hopeful at all ofc,btohqsg
The teachers ask u to write as in the whole para form or what,btohqsg
My dsa isnt for my cca,btohqsg
But as far as i know  i got my testimonial for sec is ask for it one coz of my dsa,btohqsg
Oh but please prepare referee too (i cant remember if 1 or 2),btohqsg
But just saying  jc testimonial are somewhat important in uni applications so dun play play anyhow write,btohqsg
1 minimum for NTU ABA NUS doesn't have a strict requirement for referee,btohqsg
I tot he was looking to dsa jc?,btohqsg
Oh DSA? dk need referee for that meh?,btohqsg
Yes iirc is 1 (but i think i just asked that 1 teacher to write testimonial and attach it there as referee letter),btohqsg
I tot the testimonial on your SGC is enough,btohqsg
I mean I didn't write my testimonial by right is the teacher supposed to write one but lazy and make sense cuz 40 students a bit anal so they outsource the work to ask the students to write.,btohqsg
But if u take MC on those days u won't have to write your own :),btohqsg
For my dsa applications  i needed to ask for one,btohqsg
Im not sure about other schs but my pri and sec sch u want testimonial u need to ask for it,btohqsg
The SGC is considered as Testimonial,btohqsg
eae submission date ends on 26th for o lvl students rite,btohqsg
bro you want to go asr right,btohqsg
focus on ur academics you get raw 6 want to go whatever poly course or jc uw also can go,btohqsg
Cause it seems like you dont rlly want to eae,btohqsg
He is on the fence fr,btohqsg
Tru  even if i get accepted i wont take it anyways,btohqsg
Then dun waste ur time on it,btohqsg
Need to do that dsa tho lol,btohqsg
"Screenings will continue to take place till Sunday  Jun. 30  including screenings on Jun. 30 ""until the very last session""  the post said.Standard tickets will be sold at a discounted price of S$10 at the Ang Mo Kio mall from now till its last day of operationshttps://mothership.sg/2024/06/cathay-cineplexes-amk-hub-closing/",btohqsg
It was fun while it lasted probably it would be replaced with a GV,btohqsg
Another GV??? Zzz this is the very reason I bought membership to support The Projector and I avoided watching movies at GV ‚Äî any other cinema operators also ok,btohqsg
They just don't have the same variety as other outlets,btohqsg
For example Shaw partners and usually have French films,btohqsg
GV is just like ok lor they show main stream stuff,btohqsg
Im still waiting for Look Back premiere here goddamit,btohqsg
"Oh didnt know ""The Projectors"" was a company lol",btohqsg
Different cinema operators have their exclusive movies that they screenGV   as said  is the most mainstream. Nothing bad with being mainstream but the overall variety of movies just isn‚Äôt there,btohqsg
You can check out their Golden Mile Complex cinemas haha get to experience how cinemas are like back in 80s and 90s,btohqsg
Ye just checked on google maps is it their only location?,btohqsg
They have two cinemas: Golden Mile Complex and another one at Cineleisure  co-owned with GV,btohqsg
If you want a feel of heritage  I strongly recommend Golden Mile haha,btohqsg
As of today  I‚Äôve watched 40 movies in 2024 haha,btohqsg
Which really isn‚Äôt alot compared to what I watched last year,btohqsg
I given up watching movies since covid,btohqsg
There is another small operator:https://www.eaglewingscinematics.com.sg/They only have one location,btohqsg
Even via streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ or just at the cinemas?,btohqsg
Well  it‚Äôs okay ah. Not everyone enjoys the same hobbies,btohqsg
damn I thought Im weird for not watching/getting hyped abt movies,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to do what others are doing when you don‚Äôt enjoy it üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
Dammm  how do u get invested into everyone of them,btohqsg
I only watched two movies in cinema this yr  fast and furious and Godzilla,btohqsg
Are you asking how did I enjoy all 40 movies I have watched so far?,btohqsg
Enough to sit thru like 2hrs,btohqsg
no I don‚Äôt hahaThere were 2-3 that I almost wanted to leave coz I nearly died,btohqsg
Im dying for Look Back to premiere here tho dammit,btohqsg
But I like stories in generalTop 5 movies for me this year so far: 1. Monster (ÊÄ™Áâ©; Jap); 2. Abang Adik (ÂØåÈÉΩÈùíÂπ¥; Msia) 3. ËÄÅÁãêÁã∏ ÔºàOld Fox; Taiwan); 4. Polite Society (UK) and 5. Doppelg√§nger: The Double (Poland),btohqsg
Monster was released like 2 years ago,btohqsg
I have quite low bar haha even the most cliche I can takeWhat I cannot tahan are those art house films (and I actually caught 2 of them this year üò¥),btohqsg
I watched it during the premiere,btohqsg
But I only watched it Jan this year  thanks to Projector,btohqsg
So so so so so so good,btohqsg
2 years ago it was a shaw premier lmao,btohqsg
Haha that‚Äôs why we need more than GV! Actually I only watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this year (again  thanks to Projector) even though it was THE film of my era,btohqsg
I think I was in NS then when it was first released,btohqsg
U are a kid. I wont recommend going down the critics list yet.,btohqsg
You got watch titanic 2 b4?,btohqsg
Don't bother ppl said legit garbage,btohqsg
Haha thanks for saving me 1.5-2 hours haha,btohqsg
If you have Netflix  Baby Reindeer nubbad (but disturbing themes); if you watch Taiwanese dramas  „Ää‰∏çÂ§üÂñÑËâØÁöÑÊàë‰ª¨„Äã is nice (https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en/vod/2339358/Imperfect-Us),btohqsg
bro i did nothing yet today üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
oh that film became super popz this year cause Ariana grande's latest album pays homage to that film,btohqsg
So alot of her fans went to watch it,btohqsg
Oh wow. Idk the album was a homage,btohqsg
Now that you mention  the lyrics has so much relevance! üòØ,btohqsg
Just stuff that u legally can't enjoy.,btohqsg
Is like an artist being limited in the paint colors they can use.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm not a kid ‚Ä¶ eh?,btohqsg
No like cinema some is banned lmao,btohqsg
Singapores classification ratings are a joke,btohqsg
Whenever u see Clean Passed Edited u know shit has happened.,btohqsg
I use projector for Singapore Films or Malaysian Films (the censors for malaysia is even dumber),btohqsg
Well  it is the very source of inspiration of this script by Alfian Sa‚Äôat,btohqsg
There is still a slice. Especially for Malaysian Films that are cut heavily in Malaysia and shown in Singapore,btohqsg
I saw Tiger Stripes in Premiere,btohqsg
Heck cool films like Dreaming & Dying or A Year of No Significance,btohqsg
I like how imaginative Tiger Stripes isI watched Dreaming & Dying and died. I am okok with A Year of No Significance though,btohqsg
The first film I watched in 2024 was How to have Sex I think,btohqsg
It took a while for it to actually be released in SG,btohqsg
After that I watched Anatomy of a Fall.,btohqsg
Actually I completed the Cannes list for now,btohqsg
Trust me the film is even better. U walk out being like wtf,btohqsg
Having witness a crime in which you have no way of reporting and yet are somehow a party to.,btohqsg
Alright sounds like youve given me my today plan of what to do,btohqsg
This is goooooooood tooDo you think it was a murder/accident/suicide?,btohqsg
I watch far too many movies to count tbh I legit just forget em until someone talks about them,btohqsg
Idk by that same vein do you think Stephen King is a Serial Killer?,btohqsg
The rest is thru Mubi or good old fashion pirating,btohqsg
Dune 2 is a must in cinema,btohqsg
And I actually didn‚Äôt watch both üòõ,btohqsg
I watched Dune 1 in cinemas cuz I was bored and looking to use my student card at GV,btohqsg
EntersDREAMS ARE MESSAGES FROM THE DEEP,btohqsg
Actually u just reminded me of a recent film I watched as well lmao that had an even more bizarre title: Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person,btohqsg
the album is named eternal sunshine and her music video for we can't be friends follows the plot of eternal sunshine (the girl goes to a clinic to forget the lover),btohqsg
Ahhhh thanks for letting me know haha I just read the album write up in Apple Music. Been listening to it without reading haha oops,btohqsg
How's your day lestin kor kor did u opt for early check in or u gonna check in at the same time for orientation,btohqsg
Got some cynergy research ppl come to my door,btohqsg
U got assigned double or single?,btohqsg
If it's single non AC not that bad la the most too hot u errr lose some clothes within the confines of your own room,btohqsg
Walao at that point just apply for H1 and H2,btohqsg
Cuz that's literally what it is at least 1 and 2 have convenient location,btohqsg
Pass away sia where got new hall still have non AC units...,btohqsg
Also depends on what u mean by New cause Hall 6..,btohqsg
My friend had Hall 5 the corner unit,btohqsg
Ok la honestly the size of the room is quite inconsequential to me,btohqsg
Like those rooms can fit 4 ppl no issues,btohqsg
What am i gonna do with all that room anyway,btohqsg
Na u should look at Hall 5.. its like a freaking condo bro,btohqsg
Maybe y4 i try hall 5,btohqsg
They have glass floor to celling windows,btohqsg
If i still can get hall lmao,btohqsg
Im not good at any kind of games unfortunately,btohqsg
Im only good at getting played,btohqsg
The only game was my life,btohqsg
When I die please be at my grave so u can let me down one last time,btohqsg
Accurate depiction of my life now,btohqsg
My stayc poster dropped and im too lazy to put it back up,btohqsg
Nah i just put it against the wall,btohqsg
I just keep them in a card board roll and seal it,btohqsg
But unfortunately the moment of whatever that made it drop was too much,btohqsg
Mine collection is archieved like a library but for albums,btohqsg
My nmixx signed poster is in the tube lmao i dont even take it out,btohqsg
But i do like stayc enough to want to see it,btohqsg
I see you have rolled the dice on that one,btohqsg
Funny enough i got the ticket for a 100 bucks cat 1,btohqsg
Some dude on carousell couldn't sell it one day before the concert,btohqsg
Nmix legit no one went one,btohqsg
Cat 1 all rows filled at least,btohqsg
Unlike stayc which had pockets of empty seats,btohqsg
Carousell scalpers be like 1 day before,btohqsg
Thats more than I can say for Stayc,btohqsg
Bruh even section B had empty seats for stayc,btohqsg
Idk is scalpers or what but,btohqsg
Like my friend and i were discussing if wanna move up lmao,btohqsg
I bought at open it was damn weird,btohqsg
U go in shown as unavailable,btohqsg
Then 10 mins in they open the flood gates,btohqsg
Section B was available all the way till the last day,btohqsg
But like the last few rows,btohqsg
Idk man i feel bad for them girls,btohqsg
They aren't coming back to SG that's for sure,btohqsg
Either that or they choose a smaller venue,btohqsg
Capitol is pretty nice too but the layout is dumb imo,btohqsg
I love star theatre man but if stayc cant even fill half of that up,btohqsg
Yeah they need to scale down to Capitol Theatre or smth,btohqsg
Yeah recently been to capitol theatre,btohqsg
But yeah seems like a decent size for a small group,btohqsg
As I said I hate the layout but it's smaller.,btohqsg
Maybe Suntec Convention or Expo Convention could work,btohqsg
Ok that i havent been to,btohqsg
Itzy and taeyeon did that before too,btohqsg
I curse myself for not attending itzy concert then,btohqsg
In fact I still have the signed poster for itzy in a roll somewhere,btohqsg
Their songs were bop that period,btohqsg
Back then they didn't even have a lightstick it was literally a light. stick,btohqsg
Like LED lights in a stick which they sold for 30 bucks,btohqsg
What u expect. This is the industry that charges 3 dollars for 3 AAA batteries,btohqsg
The star theatre charges 5 bucks for sparkling water,btohqsg
This is why i go to the fairprice below and buy water,btohqsg
Then empty the bottle and go in. Then fill it with Tap water,btohqsg
Eh they never made me empty any bottle tho,btohqsg
Most do. Is just u rookie,btohqsg
But star ive done that multiple times,btohqsg
Star I got ask to empty before,btohqsg
They also dont even put any bins,btohqsg
There's a bin just for liquids,btohqsg
Ok i legit havent seen it before,btohqsg
Ive been to like star 5 times and i havent been told to empty any bottle,btohqsg
U mostly go to CK star ones rite?,btohqsg
By right u should be told to empty your bottle.,btohqsg
And it's inconsistent lmao at Moonbyul Capitol is diff u can bring in liquids but u must drink 1 mouth to show,btohqsg
I dont recall but ya maybe they are inconsistent,btohqsg
I didn't receive a notification for that.,btohqsg
Lmao wait till u see the camera policy Mamamoo they were like hawks,btohqsg
Bruh gidle was like that too,btohqsg
They chased the girl in front of me out because of that lmao,btohqsg
But the girl was caught filming like 12 times or some shit before she was chased out,btohqsg
I don't use that i just wait for it to go via reddit,btohqsg
Meanwhile STAYC and IVE I take like crazy they dun care,btohqsg
I think filming this kind of thing everyone must do together,btohqsg
Yeah lmao in fact ITZY it was annoying,btohqsg
If one or two do  they single you out,btohqsg
Thats how i felt for ive LMAO,btohqsg
WHO WEAR THOSE HAIRBAND WITH THE FKING IDK THING BLOCKING,btohqsg
I just hid my camera better they ask I turn off but I proactively look around to make sure those ushers looking somewhere else,btohqsg
Fking blocking my view half the time i really wanted to take it out and throw,btohqsg
No point lanpa all put their phone up can't see shit,btohqsg
Sitting also can kenna block by people,btohqsg
I sometimes tempted to just whack it out of their hands,btohqsg
Like if you tell me downtime or fan interaction you wanna put on the hairband or wave your whatever fan  sure whatever,btohqsg
Imma slap tf out of you sia,btohqsg
Mf they do it during intermission too,btohqsg
Its probably gonna be uploaded by someone else on youtube..,btohqsg
You film they film got what difference,btohqsg
Not even that lmao the videos u can probably get a HD version when they release it out as CD,btohqsg
U pay 300 bucks I get it u wanna maximise but u telling me u wanna film something u can buy in the comfort of your own home for 50 bucks is fucking hilarious,btohqsg
you can come for class more. LT and TR all got aircon,btohqsg
Not my future TA telling me to come to class more,btohqsg
I come your class got aircon and a nice seaton your lap,btohqsg
And block his view of me so that i can sleep in his class,btohqsg
Ooo I love a man who'sso professional,btohqsg
In Uni I learnt the art of sleeping while my eyes are open,btohqsg
I once acquired that skill in the army,btohqsg
But did not practice it for years because i didnt need to,btohqsg
Dont have to sleep in class if im not even in class,btohqsg
I honestly have no idea how I actively participate I just shoot questions out my arse,btohqsg
i won‚Äôt wake you up but will smack you once class over,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a nightmare for the students if i just sit there read the solutions,btohqsg
Oh one thing i dislike that TA do is,btohqsg
They ask which questions to go through,btohqsg
And usually only the outspoken one wins because they get to choose,btohqsg
The rest of us shy ones (which is like 90% of the class) just remain silent and accept that fact,btohqsg
As in i only recall one TA doing that  to which i immediately switched off his class  but the remaining TAs i know of at least go through each question meticulously,btohqsg
Yall don't have seminar style lectures?,btohqsg
In SPMS you literally dont have to turn up for anything except mid terms and finals fr,btohqsg
i mean it depends on how many questions we have,btohqsg
Most of HSS higher level mods auto default to Seminars,btohqsg
Okay yeah that is the condition,btohqsg
I wouldnt expect yall to go through like 12 questions in a tutorial  but if its like 3 or 4  might as well talk about them all,btohqsg
for me i‚Äôd probs pick out questions i feel are the most important but if i have the ability to put out my own answers ill try to include more explanation etc,btohqsg
Unless each question require a significant amount of time,btohqsg
If the TA picks out the question I wouldn't mind that one bit,btohqsg
good catch tho. idk maybe if i have to i‚Äôll poll it online or smth so yall can just vote,btohqsg
need to see the tutorials themselves,btohqsg
i mean those people that have further questions can just shoot me on tele,btohqsg
Youll be surprised how many students will crowd you after the tutorial ends,btohqsg
The shy ones that didnt get a chance,btohqsg
it‚Äôll be part of my job,btohqsg
Some TAs just say no and direct me to the prof lmao,btohqsg
ehhh i‚Äôm p slow when answering questions ngl so i might be like ‚Äúill get back to you‚Äù,btohqsg
I think STEM its easier to answer directly on the spot,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just gonna give them my tele,btohqsg
Because its either conceptual or like some working problem,btohqsg
Which is why Consults with Profs for HSS is a mess cuz u have to basically be very receptive in terms of their feedback,btohqsg
It's like the most non specific things ever,btohqsg
I like consults with TAs cuz I can send em essay and I get like actual comments on the parts to improve,btohqsg
meanwhile my consults: you missed a term here,btohqsg
Had a consultation whereby the TA just corrected my citation,btohqsg
i just try to be as approachable as possible while TAing,btohqsg
don‚Äôt want to give off the ‚Äúi‚Äôm just here to clock in hours‚Äù vibes,btohqsg
I think most of the SPMS TAs give off that vibe and are more than happy to help,btohqsg
Like you cant even understand their english in class  no point trying to look for them outside of class LMAO,btohqsg
My TAs are like the competent ones actually have over booked consult slots while the less useful ones are empty af,btohqsg
Do they earn money doing consultations,btohqsg
No that's why they have the right to tell students to pound sand,btohqsg
Okay honestly its nice of them to offer help but i guess they should know where to draw the line,btohqsg
Yeah the consults for TAs are a gratuity,btohqsg
But then again the higher level mods are Seminar which is why I say those are legit sink or swim,btohqsg
Cuz no TA u alone and fighting thru understand the topics solely based on the Prof itself,btohqsg
So Sem if it's a bad prof it will mess you up bad,btohqsg
It is not an art  it is a natural skill for me,btohqsg
Something u gave up long ago when u decided u wanted Permanent Head Damage,btohqsg
Easy just sleep and fail the mod,btohqsg
Even if you can hear the yapping it's bold of you to assume it even makes sense in relation to the course,btohqsg
My friend likes to make notes too like u on what the prof says,btohqsg
Half way thru the sem he gave up on making it coherent cuz the prof cmi and basically just transcribed whatever gibberish the prof said,btohqsg
Come exam none of what he said came out,btohqsg
So my friend wrote 50 pages of gibberish for nothing.Such is life,btohqsg
This sounds like me coz i believe i will lose out not writing,btohqsg
Idk if its just me for STEM but,btohqsg
I see people doing that and im like,btohqsg
Arent you just copying what the prof is reading off the slides,btohqsg
Thing is this is the same prof I have a seminar with at a Y3 Elective mod,btohqsg
Sometimes i do that coz the lecturer talks so fast  i just type w/o seeing if it is on the slides or not,btohqsg
So I got screwed for 2 mods,btohqsg
Then when i revising  i realise there are duplicates,btohqsg
Type is fine  personally I think that still works,btohqsg
Na bro the Profs ramblings was not even in syllabus let alone the slides lmao,btohqsg
But people write on their ipad...,btohqsg
Jiayous‚Ä¶i believe students can survive w a poor lecturer,btohqsg
That one is a Prof.. not gonna dox him but that mf also teaches Medical Humanities at LKC med lol,btohqsg
I do that in my math class last time,btohqsg
But usually more for keeping myself awake,btohqsg
And figuring out how does the logic work,btohqsg
Normally I figure out the logic part in the readings,btohqsg
i find the prof explaining helps me connect the lines of math,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what i write down mainly,btohqsg
Then come seminar it's a fight to understand the narrative the prof tryna put forward,btohqsg
or i rehash the notes/slides into my own notes,btohqsg
Personally i think after 2 years,btohqsg
i should just stop copying notes and just go straight into looking at questions,btohqsg
because my notes feel like i just writing down the same thing as the lecture notes LOL,btohqsg
I can most likely find existing research on that topic thay basically explains and condenses the subject to an understandable level,btohqsg
Use that and form bs question that makes it sound like I am a subject matter expert,btohqsg
for physics it‚Äôs like if i‚Äôve time i‚Äôd just comb through the textbook but otherwise im cross referencing the lecture notes  what the prof says and what section they correspond to of the book,btohqsg
so many textbooks available for one field,btohqsg
I do the same just that my screen isthe application for course withdrawal,btohqsg
tbh QM 2 and anal mech the notes are quite comprehensive,btohqsg
just maybe the extra derivation steps are worth writing,btohqsg
bc the notes won‚Äôt just go step by step yk,btohqsg
can‚Äôt speak for EM but just refer to the griffiths textbook,btohqsg
damn imma need to download that before the sem starts,btohqsg
Na bruh I have it filled out it's just my hand is on hovering over the submit button,btohqsg
I actually subjected some poor soul to that in RP. I was in lesson when I received my NTU offer and was told I have to accept or reapply next year. So I ask my classmate to press the button which after he press he ask for what so I said u just press the button for my withdrawal,btohqsg
i unfortunately did not have that luxury,btohqsg
it was either accept NTU or pay for your own uni at SIM or some shit,btohqsg
Originally I didn't have to because I had the promise of NS for deferment,btohqsg
Something I lost also.. last year,btohqsg
it‚Äôs the EM bible like fr,btohqsg
I feel like is from china ones and from india ones thoughhh,btohqsg
But yea the china ones are more apparent,btohqsg
honestly i feel like as long as not singaporean,btohqsg
i cannot understand their english HAHAH,btohqsg
Oh yea his name was fillipo,btohqsg
nah prof battatio i cannot also,btohqsg
there's something wrong with my hearing,btohqsg
as long as got accent my ears cannot pick up HAHAH,btohqsg
I think we gonna have to hear a china accent one for y3,btohqsg
Which is why i prefer going actual lectures than online lectures,btohqsg
Like I get the convenience of online lectures...,btohqsg
But i feel like the audio makes their voice worser....or worse...inaudible,btohqsg
but tbh most of the time they just repeating what they wrote in the slides tho,btohqsg
Bruh y must it rain when im otw to tuition,btohqsg
if anal mech is still prof timothy  he'll be exclusively using the whiteboard,btohqsg
You cant see the whiteboard from the recording,btohqsg
I read that out of context wtf,btohqsg
analytical mechanics. but that's like the standard short form we use lmao,btohqsg
but in person it's pretty nice to see how he works through it,btohqsg
Always a classic joke tbh back in biomed there was a mod called Analytical Chemistry shorten to that so there was some one who was likeOh I love anal,btohqsg
There are some schools that have a policy of strictly no clash waviers,btohqsg
But they do recordings of their lectures,btohqsg
I hope Germany would win my dad bet all my savings on them..,btohqsg
So if germany lose  u get his savings?,btohqsg
Its a reference to this ad,btohqsg
no but he gives lecture notes,btohqsg
unless he changed it in recent years,btohqsg
I dont think his notes are in powerpoint tho...,btohqsg
ngl i‚Äôve never seen anyone so vehemently against the whiteboard LOL,btohqsg
I have been against the whiteboard ever since ta nathan decided to do on whiteboard...(at which he changed to projector),btohqsg
"""Is it small?"" YES. IT. IS. (Not against nathan tho  he damn nice)",btohqsg
wait what was the issue exactly like he wrote very small or,btohqsg
I think he wrote what he thought was big  ended up being small,btohqsg
I can guarantee I was not the only eyewitness,btohqsg
i think there‚Äôs pros and cons bc if use projector  it‚Äôs hard to show the full steps then some parts end up getting scrolled past too quickly,btohqsg
Goddam everytime i do online delivery with aliexpress i always do smth goofy,btohqsg
