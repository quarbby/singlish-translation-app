Thank you! Can I check if t bills are the same as SSBs?,btohqsg
Hi all  i am currently using the UOB Lady's Card for the Transport category for petrol top up and paying for bus rides via SimplyGo. I have linked this card to my Apple Wallet. Can i jus use my apple phone/watch to pay  or do i need to tap with the physical card itself?,btohqsg
Both is alright  the bonus rate is valid regardless,btohqsg
thanks!! I guess its the same with the rest of the credit cards? Or are there credit cards in which you can only get the bonus rate by using the physical card?,btohqsg
I would say depends  check the official card on the website or T&Cs to confirm. For example  UOB Evol requires you to spend specifically on mobile and online for maximum cashback returns,btohqsg
ah i see. i will need to check on this again. thanks alot!!! ☺️,btohqsg
Can more details about the UOBChristmas Savings Promotion,btohqsg
Why do you suggest putting in monthly rather than all at once? Would it be better to put it all in than to have the balance sitting idly in my bank in the interim?,btohqsg
Hi  ill be going to paris in december and will be doing shopping. I plan on paying with my instarem amaze card linked to my uob krisflyer credit card.Any of you know if i apply for tax refund  do i list my amaze card or my uob krisflyer card?,btohqsg
Any max Kris+ miles given per transaction? Plan to buy $2k iPhone at Harvey Norman or challenger or istudio with ocbc tr,btohqsg
Some FA in the US crunched out some numbers & their guideline is that  if the amount you're planning to invest in the market exceeds a certain % of your investment portfolio  you should DCA it.Iirc if amount to be invested > 10%  you should DCA it over 5 months. Every 5% increase you should add a month.This is so that it takes away the guesswork in whether or not the market is going to go down further or is it going to go up.But if you're confident that the market now is not going to go further down  feel free to lump sum. The impt thing here is time-in-market > timing the market. Just make sure to leave a good portion of your assets in liquid cash so you can access it in case of emergencies,btohqsg
Hi experts  are there any credit cards that includes recurring payment (investment & insurance policy) as rebate/cash back?,btohqsg
for insurance as of right now only maybank have iirc,btohqsg
Hi Rose  the main difference is the duration. T bills are 6 months or 1 year investments and SSBs are 10 year investments. The latter is very liquid and can be liquidated without losses. Do check out the MAS website to see all the details  they did a good job to explain to retail investors. Good luck on your journey  with your good start  your success probability is very high in life than many others,btohqsg
Thought for a moment the bot is talking 😂,btohqsg
I think Bots can’t recognise images 😂,btohqsg
Can reduce HDB bank loan with cpf oa?,btohqsg

Anyone tried using ocbc titanium reward card on shopee from different countries like malaysia/indonesia? Still can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
So can I withdraw the money out now? Would it forfeit the 30-day rule of this promo? Not sure if the 30 days promo refers to biz days or calendar days,btohqsg
Why not consider getting for Krisshop via Kris plus ?,btohqsg
Additional 1.5mpd from Kris+ and 2-4mpd depending on your Krisshopper status and your cc miles lor. lady card under travel category 6mpd I think,btohqsg
10% guideline applicable to SSB? As in spread out over a few months or lump sum?,btohqsg
Hotline person told me it's 30 calendar days.,btohqsg
For them  their guideline only applies to the market (so things like index funds which might generate negative returns short term). I am unsure how applicable it is to things like SSBs and T-bills which upon maturity would generate returns and the returns areknown. I would think they won't be very applicable ://,btohqsg
Doesn't that mean you have to pay $2+ five times?,btohqsg
For maybank F&F  the minimum spending will be reset in the Treats app on the 1st of every month? Or based on statement cycle? Cos my Treats app has reset the spending statistics today but my cycle should start on the 22nd of every month,btohqsg
Only SSB $2  t-bills free. Initially only wanted to get 30k  then I kinda feel like maybe the cut off yield will be very high so I applied another 20k.,btohqsg
Is petrol spending classified as automobile spend for cimb world master card?,btohqsg

Thanks  I will translate the content to a video,btohqsg
"Anyone knows if there's a ""good time"" to withdraw money from moomoo money market fund? I.e.  initiate withdrawal to bank account and still be able to earn 1 more day of interest depending on the time I withdraw the money? If I'm not wrong  whatever is in the money market fund as of 8am of a trading day will be eligible to earn interest so if I make a withdrawal at 8.01am would that technically maximise my yield instead of say withdrawing at 7.59am?",btohqsg
Anyone know how to request Uob one to change the period they bill?,btohqsg

Hi  for those who emptied your UOB account yesterday for the UOB christmas promo… today i had registered for the christmas promotion (got the email on my participation) and instantly put back my 100k into my uob account. Am i right to have done this? Or should i be waiting to put my money back? Not sure if i should be waiting to put it back  but dont want to lose out on UOB one interest,btohqsg
Hi all  how to maximise the rewards of the Lady's card?,btohqsg
choose the category that you can max out?,btohqsg
yes besides that? is there any other loopholes or boosters?,btohqsg
you can do that  but noted that value date for the $100k u deposit will be tomorrow  since today is Sunday. Average daily balance ADB= $100k×(30/31) = $96774  if possible can top up to max out the 7.8% for $75k to $100k tier,btohqsg
