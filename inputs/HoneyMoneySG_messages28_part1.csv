Any recommendations if want to topup to revolut?ü§î,btohqsg
any ways to check the mcc before paying?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs one time payment and not recurring then it sounds terrible,btohqsg
Hi can i check does 7eleven accepts Amex payment?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt - I only ask the different FIs the MCCs after paying.However you are inclined you may temp block your DBS card  use their chat bot and ask about the MCCs of transactions - usually not the four digit number but a description next to the amount and merchant etcGood thing about DBS is they have WWMC which is a great card regardless of (most reasonable) MCCs.,btohqsg
any idea what is this for? randomly got credited into my UOB one CC,btohqsg
Yea it's one time payment. The cx service for Citibank mentioned telco is not included. Not sure if they are changing or something different with myrepublic.,btohqsg
Depends on the different 7-Elevens  I‚Äôd say the closer ones to me don‚Äôt accept Amex. Strange because isn‚Äôt Yuu card Amex ?,btohqsg
Oooh. Then it‚Äôs ü§® puzzling. Would be very wary.I don‚Äôt know whether charging on Amaze card makes any difference,btohqsg
quite clearly citi customer service is smoking u,btohqsg
Eh... Then how do I get my rewards properly credited in this case if it's blocked by the cx service. =(,btohqsg
No 7 eleven dont take amex,btohqsg
I could tag Instarem Amaze to my Citi Rewards card  I was actually thinking of this. What if Amaze screws up? Who is going to own the screw up?To my horrors this happened to some folks.I applied for Citi Rewards (and DBS WWMC) anyway. When not using my Amaze card I simply tag to wallet and ‚Äúlock‚Äù my card.,btohqsg
May be a good idea to lock the card when not in use,btohqsg
Also if screw up happens even with your vigilance  do consider raising with Firdec.Even if Revolut has audit issues and the business environment isn‚Äôt conducive to challenger FIs to shake the competition  we still can make the most out of what we have.,btohqsg
My thoughts. I experienced a fraud transaction attempt on my amaze 1 week after I had received it  and I had never used the physical card at that time. Attempt from some gaming website in the US. Their support just told me to request a new card. Ive lost trust in Amaze after that.,btohqsg
"I also tried instarem for a remit transaction (as they had $20 discount for first time) and it was a horrible experience. They told me the receiving bank had ""technical difficulties"" after 5 days. Then asked for my bank statements and source of funds before refunding my money from instarem to my bank after the failed transaction. DBS did the exact same remittance in 2hrs no hassle  but of course slightly expensive",btohqsg
Basically that's their response. No investigation,btohqsg
I think can use limit the amaze card to use in-store purchase ?They have several likeonline purchaseMagnetic stripOversea transaction,btohqsg
Lock AmazeI always lock everything when not in use and unlock when I am using the card,btohqsg
This is good idea! Can just allow in-store purchase!,btohqsg
I think might be a good way to really limit it to only in-store payment,btohqsg
Gg amazing really amazing hack Care,btohqsg
FYI once you link your card to instarem  it can NEVER be removed unless you add another card. So I will just assume my linked card has been compromised and request a new one. But just a heads up to others from my experience.  :(,btohqsg
Oh this is bad and can't link to another virtual card too to temporary fix guess either cancelled amaze or tell your cc card to issue a new card,btohqsg
Exactly and they have the audacity to recommend this. I am just glad to be out of this before harm done,btohqsg
He sounds normal what  just straight to the point and say I want this done  can you do it or not? If someone is holding my card details hostage you better bet i'd be even more pissed off than that,btohqsg
Can add Revolut virtual Mastercard (if you have one) to Instarem and remove your bank card,btohqsg
May i ask  wrt to instaram issue above.,btohqsg
Spending of 44k on homedepot. Are we able to set a daily credit of $500 a day? Means no transaction above $500 allowed in a day?,btohqsg
You should be able to set that in your bank app,btohqsg
I know POSB/DBS allows you to set spending limit,btohqsg
Which means she didnt set any?,btohqsg
that seems to be the case,btohqsg
Hi can we top up Medisave using CPF OA?,btohqsg
I don't think u can post referral link here,btohqsg
Is paying for handset re-contract in M1 Shop a eligible transaction? Let's say for HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
A dp: I paid iVisa using Trust Card thinking my Oz ETA sure Kena no reward but I‚Äôll save on FX anyway. Surprise  have LinkPoints :)Almost automatic approval  Singapore citizen with only Singapore passport,btohqsg
One way i can think of circumventing this is maybe we can link our GPMC to unlink the cc and then lock the GPMC? But havent tried this so not sure if its a possibility,btohqsg
I giro pay Singtel bill to my EVOL card.,btohqsg
I called Singtel to confirm. Alternative  you can check with UOB Chat  but only for bills already charged to your credit card.,btohqsg
no wonder under others  could have paid monthly online to earn online rebate.,btohqsg
cannot add other prepaid card to Amaze,btohqsg
Anyway  for EVOL  max cb for online is $20 (max spending $250)  max cb for mobile is $20 (max spending $250)  so just giro Singtel bill to clock $100  to meet min monthly spending of $600.,btohqsg
Anyone know if Citi rewards card added to ComfortDelGro  grab etc.. does it consider as online?,btohqsg
If I wanna signup for instarem  just use ur referral link? No need to key in any referral code?,btohqsg
This is good. Thanks for the idea!,btohqsg
