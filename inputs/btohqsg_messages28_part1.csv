Even those you did not get,btohqsg
@zoellxregarding our discussion a few weeks ago. Not sure if you had clarified with HDB yet  but if you have not  this is the black and white that it has been reset,btohqsg
For privacy I will re-forward without names,btohqsg
Means there is no 2 ballot chance?,btohqsg
There is. What the screenshot is referring to is the additional ballot chances that people could accumulate from having unsuccessful applications,btohqsg
Last time if you applied for non mature estate and you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in non mature estates  on your 3rd try you would get 3 ballot chances instead of 2.Eg applied forTengahThen hougangThen punggolAll 3 are non mature so when you apply for punggol and if tengah and hougang were unsuccessful  for punggol application you have 3 ballot chances,btohqsg
Now  since there's no mature non-mature classification  the criteria is standardSo from Oct 2024  if you applied for standard estate and you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in standard estates estates  on your 3rd try you would get 3 ballot chances instead of 2,btohqsg
The question a few weeks ago was  if you applied for non mature last time and was unsuccessful 2x or more and this time you applied for standard  would you get the extra ballot chance for this one?And the answer is no. They ignore all past unsuccessful applications and start you back at the normal number of ballot chances. Which is 2 if you're 1st timer,btohqsg
Hmm...so of my June ballot was unsuccessful  I should have 2 ballot chances for Oct ballot?,btohqsg
No  if you‚Äôre unsuccessful for Oct and Feb and they are standard  and you apply for June standard  you will get 1 extra ballot chance,btohqsg
Still confusing. I applied SBF in Feb and BTO in June. Both were unsuccessful. How many ballot chances I have for Oct BTO?,btohqsg
Mine didn't mention any abt ballot chances,btohqsg
I didn't take any priority scheme,btohqsg
You're single? 1.Whatever you applied for before Oct 2024 doesn't matter for extra ballot chances.,btohqsg
Yes single. No more to scroll down,btohqsg
That's why I wonder why I don't see 1 ballot chance in the box,btohqsg
Yeah kinda strange that you don't see a section for # of ballot chances...,btohqsg
Wonder if any other singles can share if they see the same thing or if they can see ballot chances,btohqsg
If you want@allanyjjyou can try to call HDB to confirm # of ballot chances that they give you,btohqsg
But my understanding is it will be 1 for you for this application,btohqsg
Single too and similarly it doesn‚Äôt state the ballot chances at that page,btohqsg
I'm not sure if it's new but others (couples?) Shared screenshots of their page and there was a section on ballot chances,btohqsg
Any idea why mine only 2 not 3?,btohqsg
Ah I see. So probably that section is for those applying as a couple,btohqsg
If anyone does call HDB to clarify on all this  do update us!,btohqsg
Nope. Same for me. No section indicating my ballot chances. Applied 3rd time then get my appt and number. The prev 2 didn‚Äôt get at all. Oversub,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.Just want to be clear that the extra ballot thing wont apply unless you meet specific criteria + won't apply until at least Jun 2025 launch.Specific criteria being:- you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in standard estates- you apply for standard estate,btohqsg
Separately  wondering if the extra ballot chance will apply to singles since there isnt a section for ballot chances for singles...,btohqsg
Welcome. No idea really how the ballot chances work for singles. But yeah if you don‚Äôt succeed  try and try again I suppose? My 3rd time I went down with appt no. But only 3 units left! All the ones I wanted bo liao‚Ä¶. So took me some time to decide to proceed anot. HDB Officer then say ok you have to decide. If you don‚Äôt want to select now  we give it to the next one and you can apply for another BTO once released‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ üò¨,btohqsg
Hence got place also doesn‚Äôt mean you confirm will get a unit. Pray hard. And good luck! ü§ûüèº,btohqsg
You can reject if left 10 units and less . They won't ban you for non  selection,btohqsg
Errrr but I dowan reject liao. 4th time means have to wait another 4-5 years‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
So not so much the ban or no ban,btohqsg
Yup. Not bad unit really. Tho it isn‚Äôt the unit I initially wanted. Was Lucky.Got the keys Nov 2022. Woodlands üôÇ,btohqsg
My appt to select flat supposed to be tmr. However the last 20 units were sold within 3 working days  after hdb contact me with the appt date and time. So now I can only wait for Oct Q result,btohqsg
Exactly! Hahaha. Hence is good lah now got more chances for singles. And Central Area!!! Damn Swee leh those who get this in the upcoming one,btohqsg
Depends on building time of ur project. Like for example the bukit batok brickville building time abt 2 years only. But very popular. 50/130 2R allocated to singles and application rate is 36.2. I feel that it is a trap ü§£,btohqsg
To move at 40  let's say max 5 years building time   at 35 you need to secure a unit alreadyAfter 35   it is possible after 40 then can move. As maybe not every BTO launch you will ballot,btohqsg
If you not keen on the projects,btohqsg
Yet this group of single applicants did not cancel and change to taman jurong on the last day of ballot,btohqsg
1224/130. Single application rate 36.2. Last day of ballot they still persistent and did not cancel,btohqsg
Tbh 130 units flat mix 2R is very little,btohqsg
So there's no point to risk it mainly for the 2 years building time,btohqsg
That's why I say the 2R flexi is a trap for BB brickville .,btohqsg
Singles who did not cancel their applications for BB brickville  i really salute them. They are very persistent. Also have to thank them for not changing to taman jurong thus result in taman 2R low rate = less competition,btohqsg
Trapped by the 24 months waiting time,btohqsg
Guys do you know if October results out alrdy?,btohqsg
Hopefully next week will have news,btohqsg
When are we getting the Q number for the October 2024 BTO Launch? Has anyone who applied got it? I am still waiting in Taman Jurong Skyline.,btohqsg
ChatGpt :Based on past patterns  the results for the October 2024 BTO could be released around18‚Äì20 December 2024. HDB usually announces results on weekdays  soThursday  19 December 2024  is a reasonable estimate. However  it could vary slightly depending on processing times.Keep checking HDB‚Äôs official portal or your registered email/SMS for the exact announcement.,btohqsg
