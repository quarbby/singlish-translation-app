COE quota should consume only 1 since same person..  give the quota to someone else..,btohqsg
I never understood the need for 1 person to have 10 cars,btohqsg
Maybe drive 2 remaining 8 is storage,btohqsg
Or maybe allow multiple cars per person  but at anytime only 1 can be driven. So technically speaking the person just need 1 COE,btohqsg
Nevermind.. rich man's collection/toy ma.. buy as many coe as he wan  but should only use 1 quota..,btohqsg
Garnement should separate coe and quota lol..,btohqsg
COE is for the car. Not the person,btohqsg
So it makes perfect sense. Want multiple car  pay the coe,btohqsg
Yes. But should consume only 1 quota since coe is to control the number of cars on the road not the number of cars in your garage.,btohqsg
The cars in e garage will be on the road,btohqsg
Really only 2 driving 8 storage de,btohqsg
2 driving  2 in cp or 1 driving 3 in cp,btohqsg
Or all 4 out at one go also have,btohqsg
Tats why coe per person  can have multiple cars  any 1 time  only 1 car. What we want is less cars on the road  dc how many u hiding in ur hse,btohqsg

If they insist on Para 1  then make sure all their cars does not have digital head unit and all their cars display r analogue,btohqsg
Cos head units n digital displays r all visual display units,btohqsg
If it does nt cause distractions  then its not a violation,btohqsg

Hi guys  what are your thoughts on throttle controllers.Is it the real deal  or some gimmick and Iâ€™m better off relying on the manufacturerâ€™s normal/sports mode ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Usually when tht happen  i offline go coffeeshop drink coffee,btohqsg
works  not more power  just more sensitive throttle mapping,btohqsg
they can make a huge difference to how responsive the car feels. there is no added power. But it will feel very different and IMO worth it. For some cars its not so necessary because they have nice aggressive throttle maps from the factory (porsche for eg) but for other brands like lexus its almost a must to have them because the factory mapping is very sluggish and sport modes dont do much,btohqsg
They have their own clienteles and assigned jobs,btohqsg
Use the money to tune ur car,btohqsg

Best luxury you can get without buying continental,btohqsg
U ok or not? Comparing a sedan to a MPV?,btohqsg
Lexus sedan beats the crap out of any toyota sedan,btohqsg
Lexus LM wins AVF hands down,btohqsg
He not ok. But let him have his win la. Pete logic can't fight,btohqsg
Lexus sedan have better insulation than toyota Camry. I think lexus still better quality.But it does not have the prestige that continental car have  so if buy that car for the sake of face I think should not go for lexus,btohqsg
Wonder hows the price for the new Lexus LBX,btohqsg
"in this day and age  i also wonder  honestly  you drive like a merc A200 or entry level bmw 3series really got face meh? all it screams to me is ""all my money spent on badge  not much left to actually buy a decent car""",btohqsg
About the same amount of money gets you the lexus ES which is a proper luxury car on the inside and probably in the driving refinement as well  compare to those 1.4 litre 4 banger engines used in the contis,btohqsg
"For people who know about cars  they will know that it is an entry level BMW. But for those that don't know about cars will just say ""Wa that guy drive BMW""",btohqsg
When I asked people if they know lexus they ask me is it chocolate brand or not lol,btohqsg
But if I ask drivers then of course they know they value that lexus have,btohqsg
so the only ones that get duped are the ones who know nothing about cars..and their opinion doesnt matter anyway...and people spend upwards of 200k to impress these kinda people? I guess I can't quite understand that,btohqsg
Pretty sure a 1.4 conti is cheaper than a lexus tho,btohqsg
actually even a non car guy just has to spend 5 mins inside a static A200 and then jump into an ES250 and within 10 seconds anyone could tell the massive difference. thats what i did at the recent car show (although i am of course a car guy  but the difference is like night and day),btohqsg
could be  not 100% on that. but pricing for sure isnt too far apart,btohqsg
"Yeah  if really try to sit and learn more details  buyers will know that BMW entry level is not that great. But if their goal is to have that ""perceived succes"" (insurance agent  property agent  sales etc..) having a branded well recognize badge is easier to convey than explaining to people his lexus is more premium than BMW",btohqsg
well all i could see was a ES300h selling at 350k (they dont sell the es250) anymore and the C & C price of the A200 AMG line is 300+k,btohqsg
so i would say the ES250 and A200 are pretty much same price tier,btohqsg
any reason you chose a tiguan?,btohqsg
VW not as recognised as BMW for branding purpose,btohqsg
326k for a a200. 350k for an ES300h when i was mentioning ES250. looks like my numbers were right,btohqsg
you see C & C  only a200 amg line there,btohqsg
we can go back and forth over 5 cent 10 cent if you like. but i think its pretty clear they roughly sit in the same price bracket,btohqsg
do you own one of these entry level contis?,btohqsg
U need compare apple and apples  not vs Apples and Pears,btohqsg
unless there is a PI price on the ES250,btohqsg
If u really wanna compare es300  u need to compare it with E250,btohqsg
you are taking this strangely personally,btohqsg
do you own an entry level conti? for full disclosure  i own no car in this bracket,btohqsg
i dun own a conti  but u called 1.4 gangbangers vs a 2.5 NA,btohqsg
my numbers were pretty clear but if you think its flawed  you're entitled to your opinion,btohqsg
i called it a 4 banger,btohqsg
i guess you took it personally. ok,btohqsg
If u were comparing Es250 vs e200 yes  es250 is definitely more value,btohqsg
i was comparing es250 (non hybrid) to the A200,btohqsg
that is a really nice car as well but i dont think you can buy that anymore,btohqsg
copped as in got one? congrats,btohqsg
Did people sell w212 e class' because they were taxis?,btohqsg
Did people sell vezels cause they were common phv cars?,btohqsg
Mind you all of those way more units,btohqsg
Some prefer to buy 3ers for driving experience  especially the b48 powered ones,btohqsg
Driving dynamics are preferred as well,btohqsg
You don't own a mercs or bmw right?,btohqsg
i have before but not entry level ones,btohqsg
i have owned entry level japanese shitmobiles as well,btohqsg
you are not even comparing across the same classes,btohqsg
it was pretty obvious before  but since you missed it  i was talking similar price tiers,btohqsg
ES same price tier as A class?,btohqsg
please scroll up and read what i already wrote,btohqsg
A class 200+  E Class 300+,btohqsg
did you compare C & C A200 price to Borneo ES250 price?,btohqsg
