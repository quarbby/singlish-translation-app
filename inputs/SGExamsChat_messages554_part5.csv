hi does anyone have any idea on signing on if I fuck my a lvl up ðŸ’€,btohqsg
no bro i genuinely feel theres a decent chance i fuck some things up ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ this is a srs qn,btohqsg
I had the same idea lol,btohqsg
The prob is like at this juncture I genuinely feel there's a 99% chance I'm going to fuck up quite a few subjects in my rxams,btohqsg
on the day i collected my results  i was mentally prepared to sign lmao,btohqsg
i was considering doing a random major so at least i can come back as senior officers with higher starting pay,btohqsg
like how do I express interest to sign,btohqsg
now youre a 90 rp god applying to UK,btohqsg
that's the thing I'm prob pes c9 or snth,btohqsg
well just tell your encik lor see what they guide you  when i first enlisted  they got asked anyone interested to sign  then those that raised hand  they got transferred to the regular platoon,btohqsg
oh wa then i not sure,btohqsg
so i don;t know what am i supposed to do,btohqsg
i mean is it confirmed you c9 or you haven't gone for the check up and just guessing,btohqsg
i've just finished my final checkup a few days ago  think i'll be c9,btohqsg
i genuinely think im going to have to sign on,btohqsg
he gonna see you in kranji bro,btohqsg
oh just condition on the heart,btohqsg
no lah  the 90rp god is@some_username03,btohqsg
I think that one is more than just 90rp,btohqsg
Think of it like a FAQ bot about medical center,btohqsg
And if you need find info about FFIs can use the bot also,btohqsg
wait I donâ€™t get what 10th percentile mean,btohqsg
But a fancier way of saying it,btohqsg
So basically if in 10th percentile youre like,btohqsg
10 but in the bottom 10,btohqsg
then the last 10 got below 3.67 ah,btohqsg
Damn that is a good scoring class,btohqsg
i wanna do life sciences in uni,btohqsg
thats what i want to stody for sure,btohqsg
but i have no clue after that,btohqsg
like i if i want continue rite,btohqsg
and do research or some shit,btohqsg
the pay is shit thats one,btohqsg
Dw in every course thereâ€™s always a job position with a high pay,btohqsg
Just that it depends how many people are aiming for that course which will diminish your chances of it,btohqsg
If you study it more and youâ€™re passionate for it  go ahead! It means lesser competition with such a choice,btohqsg
but then i go all my animals here,btohqsg
Youâ€™re certain about the course so go ahead  your animals you can think about how to treat them along the way while planning !,btohqsg
What is the Career progression of that course anyways,btohqsg
Hey but you are learning to be a responsible caretaker,btohqsg
my hobby also is my side hustle,btohqsg
