Im also tryna train for noi next yr with c++,btohqsg
if you're ever interested in ai stuff in the future (like post a's) lmk,btohqsg
I scared by the time im actly in the job market or entering uni its oversaturated/overly competitive,btohqsg
i mean if you're going towards the cs direction  experience in various fields can only help,btohqsg
But i also think im int in finance,btohqsg
it's just that i have connections for ai side at astar,btohqsg
ü§∑ barely any info so far,btohqsg
Only got give training dates and time,btohqsg
Competition date have but no duration,btohqsg
Actly if finance portfolio can do wat,btohqsg
i mean finance is very broad so it fr depends on what aspect you're interested in,btohqsg
guys nyp eng or rp biz,btohqsg
Investment maybe  need read up more,btohqsg
which course are you leaning to / more passionate in  eng or biz,btohqsg
more passionate in biz but was so convinced i wldnt get into rp biz so i convinced myself to go nyp eng alr,btohqsg
so like my mind did a 180 flip frm biz to eng,btohqsg
Ahh yeah   sounds more like general advice üòÖüòÖ like archeology degree can't do a good job for living uh,btohqsg
I recommend going competitions first if worth the effort and relevant to portfolio you attempt to create uh,btohqsg
Like e.g. you want a university major in computer science   the competition better be related to coding etc.,btohqsg
computer science can do alot of trades üòÅ,btohqsg
Uhh especially these days in digital era,btohqsg
what's ODAC?This is what I googled. lol,btohqsg
oh where random people group together track around singapore one ah,btohqsg
Mostly about camping and sruvival skills,btohqsg
Ye knots and stuff my snr said,btohqsg
Hi everyone I lost my PW cert and I need it for uni application‚Ä¶. How?,btohqsg
There is singpass for you to look at the pw and mt grade,btohqsg
It says here you can obtain a soft copy by going to myskillsfuture portal,btohqsg
Same place we get can our degree soft copy once we graduate,btohqsg
Why university need o level results?,btohqsg
Like wouldn't higher education cert be sufficient,btohqsg
Tbh most of the unis dont rlly require  but for some like business  you do still need O level A maths,btohqsg
As for why  is more of just to see if either: a) you have the prerequisites to do certain taskings (e.g. Business and economics require some form of calculus which some polys dont teach for business) or b) to add on bridging courses to bridge the gaps (more common for engineering courses that require Physics),btohqsg
I see   but let's say a person applying for business has passed h2 math   wouldn't that prove he/she can handle calculus too ?,btohqsg
I thinking university should streamline applications in some ways uh,btohqsg
Yea. That's why we dont need to show O level results for this,btohqsg
is it why some ppl retake o lvls or take o lvls amaths as private candidates,btohqsg
Kinda crazy that its like easier than amath apparently,btohqsg
Not rlly much on the retake part  more on the private candidate part,btohqsg
I think is cus A math does not have probability and stats topics but more focus on pure math topics,btohqsg
Whereas for h1 math  there is a larger proportion on probability and stats,btohqsg
But of course i do believe there needs to be improvements uh,btohqsg
Like for e.g. those in poly also took like advance math mods also but some unis dont consider,btohqsg
Poly stats vs h1 math stats think h1 easier   if I were to be honest here - poly cannot use gc so it requires manual calculation of various parameters,btohqsg
I wld say convenient than easy,btohqsg
anyone got tips for h2 chemistry,btohqsg
I wld say j1 chem wld be more math based (excepr for periodic table topics),btohqsg
That one i believe is more on practice,btohqsg
For j2 one is more on concepts so like organic chem and transitional elements,btohqsg
That one i wld say I tried to make memorisation easier by using mnemonics,btohqsg
