PW is just an arbitrary thing they make us do,btohqsg

Tbh at the end of the day most local unis look at your subject grades,btohqsg
go jc if your results very good at least 14,btohqsg
I mean like the reason why I asking is bcz clearly idt I can make it into jc,btohqsg
bro you wont flourish in jc,btohqsg
yeah ik.. all routes are possible but pls la... 3.8+ hard to maintain,btohqsg
My friends in poly got 3.7 got into uni,btohqsg
that's why I'm like what if I js go poly but if I rly cmi.. then I js alevels as a priv candidate.. bc I'm aiming for schs like .. law .. or Med.. which usually take in JC kids,btohqsg
business sch  isok I can still try in poly,btohqsg
Don’t think too much about taking A levels first,btohqsg
but those two.. abit hard to say,btohqsg
Just try your best in poly,btohqsg
try to look out for any obsatcles,btohqsg
like in poly then aim for the A,btohqsg
I rly can't do projects  I rather js study,btohqsg

1. you go jcPrepare for hell and studying like crazy2. You go poly get 3.7 plus prepare for internships to carry grp mates prepare to not let gpa dip,btohqsg
it's to the pt where I have to isolate myself,btohqsg
the thing is if you never go uni you are stuck,btohqsg
U SEE  BUT POLY IS DO PROJECT BASED which I obviously cmi... hence no 3.7,btohqsg
i just wanna know how work is,btohqsg
but stuff that smart average ppl can still go,btohqsg
MDIS / PSB / Kaplan / SIM,btohqsg
Less prestigious means private and people alr look down on those,btohqsg
but ehh so ex for what,btohqsg
Also most of the people who enroll in private Uni(s) are mostly foreigners?,btohqsg
You can’t compare country to country like that lol,btohqsg
And americans are dumb as hell,btohqsg
yea tbf med/law is mostly 100% jc,btohqsg
but then agn why'd u wanna do med/law,btohqsg
a levels too easy for them,btohqsg
but p1 save me i think,btohqsg
they shd hv went quant or smth,btohqsg
but yea quant can make u much more... so those 90rp students most prob would go there now,btohqsg
Quant is like a legitimate career path for me if I want I think,btohqsg
It used to be where low rp people went,btohqsg

Eh I enjoy my research for now,btohqsg
