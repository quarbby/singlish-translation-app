Btw u know Singtel shop booth there is a automate machine to pay bill right those can use uob one card to pay to entitled Cashback or we just pay via the Singtel app will also enjoy Cashback ?,btohqsg
The $500 min spend criteria for uob one is all for spend categories?,btohqsg
How about the $600 min spend criteria for uob evol? For all spend categories?,btohqsg
Typical dining  supermarket  petrol  hotel  flight ok. It all mentioned in tnc.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not mentioned what makes up the spend criteria. It only mention the exclusions for cash back   not spend criteria.,btohqsg
Separately for citigold  do we still get the $1000 sign up bonus if we place all the $250k into the 3 month 4% fixed deposit ? (Recently experience no sign up bonus for scb when my fund was placed in fixed deposit),btohqsg
So for insurance payments  school fees etc  I can use that to meet spend criteria but will not earn cashback  do you understand that way too?,btohqsg
Hey if a restaurant is running a Citibank promo like $35 off the bill for $250 spending  can I use Citi rewards + amaze card and pay physically with the amaze card to clock points while still fulfilling the promo? ü§î,btohqsg
Insurance do not qualify for cashback for evol ‚Ä¶ u mean u want to use this card to do so?,btohqsg
I want to qualify for the min spend criteria  not for cashback. So as long as I spend any transactions including insurance up to $500  I can get cash back for those eligible spend.,btohqsg
U check section 18 19 20 the ‚Äútransaction‚Äù exclude insurance and also the other spend in section 19 also means it is excluded as it say other transactions. Hope I don‚Äôt confuse more than this üòÜ,btohqsg
I went to the bank to ask and she told me spend anything up to $500 without exclusions and the eligible spend will qualify for cashback. üòû,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong just try it out will know,btohqsg
UOB One CC/Evol and UOB One savings account has different criteriasUOB One savings includes insurance for $500 min spendBut Evol and UOB One CC don‚Äôt include insuranceIs that what u are asking?,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs the confusion. Does monthly recurring payment for telco qualify the spend criteria and earn cash back for UOB ONE. For UOB ONE savings  does telco payment qualify the $500 spend?,btohqsg
Buddy  off hand I do not have the T&C w me for both  but my gut feel is that telco should qualify,btohqsg
How about SimplyGo transactions for both spend criteria for uob one cc and savings?,btohqsg
I just did a check on UOB ONE CC website.SimplyGo qualifies,btohqsg
Did u find what u are looking for?,btohqsg
RHB Fixed Deposit 3.9% for 12/24 months,btohqsg
i faced this problem as well  there was one month where i achieved 500 for UOB acc  but didnt qualify for cashback  due to purchasing cap vouchers,btohqsg
which qualified for the UOB interest but not cashback spending,btohqsg
Hi bros. I need help  i am looking for starhub bank and account no to add as payee to pay for monthly bills to earn miles at citi¬† payall or card up.. how to check on this... I called starhub . They not keen to help on this,btohqsg
Is payment using Fairprice QR code on the Fairprice app considered online spending under the UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
I am not Starhub user but you can possibly pay with  your Citi card on the Starhub app,btohqsg
Ya  unless it‚Äôs excluded for miles for ur card otherwise it‚Äôs paying admin fees for no reason,btohqsg
I don't mind pay admin fee. As long as earn miles,btohqsg
So means I can earn miles using my miles card to pay for this,btohqsg
Think so. It did mention recurring payment but did not exclude telco,btohqsg
Like that I think can just use the StarHub app to add the credit card as a recurring paymentUnless Citibank Premiermiles excludes telco from their rewards,btohqsg
Okay hope it helps  sometimes the T&C just need to read a bit  should have most answers unless it‚Äôs ambiguous,btohqsg
Anyway I just checked Citi payall  seems like StarHub is not in the list for payment.I might be wrong,btohqsg
Bro  sometimes is not allow eg  by 3rd party eg axs .. payment for bills  nil miles earn,btohqsg
Or online banking payment  also disallow.,btohqsg
Uob one account  qualifying spend is by month one huh‚Ä¶ just realise it doesn‚Äôt go by the credit card cycle,btohqsg
Thats why they keep wants us to use citi pay all and card for payment of bills,btohqsg
why not pay via starhub app?,btohqsg
Hey guys  plan to apply a credit card in Sing saver. As I‚Äôm moving house  I will purchase quite a bit of stuff. Which credit card you all will consider? For cash back? Rewards?,btohqsg
Moving house ocbc titanium card usually bigger purchase,btohqsg
Using instarem will still earn you miles or cashback depend on the card.,btohqsg
Calendar month? Then what about UOB one CC?,btohqsg
I have Citi cashback card the $800 spend criteria has any exclusions? Can it be used to buy vouchers? I hope to redeem my cashback and cancel the card.,btohqsg
Oh then how to sync UOB ONE CC and savings?,btohqsg
Wah this group chat is on a roll man. üòÇ,btohqsg
Try calling up UOBI think they might be able to help,btohqsg
Just need to call up lor,btohqsg
Yes  you can buy vouchers. But read TnC  I think you cannot cancel as you need to hold the card for some period stated in TnC. Otherwise they'll claw back the reward.,btohqsg
Hi which cc is best card to use for watsons online?,btohqsg
if i have an existing posb debit card  am i considered new to bank when applying dbs credit card?,btohqsg
Guys be careful using axs pay plus earn.Pay insurance   phone bills   sp expenses by dbs woman .They use blocks of 5  less than 100 points earn.Use citi pay all better. I have earn 36000 miles there already,btohqsg
