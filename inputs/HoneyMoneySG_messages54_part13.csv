Chee hean  its late.. good nite.,btohqsg
Other than PayPal  what app can we bundle UOB Absolute and earn a good cashback? Thanks,btohqsg
It seems PayPal doesn’t offer a debit card or wallet in Singapore like grab pay.,btohqsg
U can paynow or grabpay to top up.,btohqsg
Sometimes u can use this platform to withdraw your excess grabpay funds.,btohqsg
guys  other than first 100k in uob one 5%  any good interest accounts?,btohqsg
Morning everyone.Can CRMC earn 4M/$ used in watson. as Watson is under 5912.. haha  part of shopping? confusing sia,btohqsg

Good morning everyone  just wondering if anyone has prvi miles both visa and mastercard or can we only apply for one?,btohqsg

Hi guys   can crmc earn 4mpd on grab transport?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how they classify taobao/shopee mcc? If I have a mix of clothing and furniture what MCC will they use?,btohqsg
Suggest to split it into different payments. If you combined it into one payment  only one of the mcc codes in the purchase list will be used to represent the mcc code for all your purchased.,btohqsg
If that's the case  UOB ladys solitaire is pretty useless for me 😅 Most of the big purchases coming up are furnitures and electronics. Thank you!,btohqsg
What cc do you guys use for furniture purchases on Taobao? Amount more than $1k,btohqsg
that’s why i’m applying for hsbc revol now… citi rewards too confusing,btohqsg
Hi all  for the UOB one account  to fulfill the spending requirement of $500  is it okay if I spend $250 on the Lady's card and $250 on the EVOL card to make it $500?,btohqsg
EVOL needs min $600 to get cashback,btohqsg
I’m just talking about fulfilling the UOB one account criteria,btohqsg
should I use UOB  Lady’s card (family category chosen) in MUSTAFA  to get 6 miles which is better than OCBC Titanium since its MCC 5441 is grocery and supermarket?UOB only lists out NTUC  Sheng Siong  Giant and Cold Storage…. So I like to reconfirm for MUSTAFA.Thanks guys! 😁🙏🏻,btohqsg
Apologies. Pls ignore previous comment. Mustafa can use UOB lady. MCC 5411 under Family Category to earn 6MPD,btohqsg
You can use HeyMax to check,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarifying on this. 😁🙏🏻 your help is greatly appreciated.,btohqsg
Hi anyone tried to buy yoga movement classes with UOB PPV before? Will I get UNI$?,btohqsg
U can get all 3  amex  visa  mastercard,btohqsg
I think the problem with mustafa is that their terminal have different mcc. Like only their supermarket is 5411 and those that sell electonics is other mcc. Platform like amazon may have segregate their amazon fresh from other amazon sales etc.,btohqsg
Oh I see 😮. Thank you for the reminder. 😄🙏🏻 good to take note of it. 👍🏻,btohqsg
ocbc tr dont include furnitures though,btohqsg
Court  ikea  taobao also get bonus miles for ocbc tr,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows if prepaid income tax will be refunded by iras? Considering to prepay income tax using Citi-Payall before end Aug to utilize the 1% HSBC everyday+ giro promo,btohqsg
yes.. but they will take a long time to refund.. most likely  it'll just be used to pay the following years income tax.I just recently got a refund of property tax from IRAS from my dad's estate. My dad passed away in 2016.. it took IRAS 7 years to issue a check refund  after his estate has already been long distributed out.. That's how long IRAS took for us.. but yes  they ultimately do refund.,btohqsg
Thanks. Good to know. Seems like the odds of HSBC extending their everyday+ beyond Aug is low. 😭,btohqsg
If u overpay income tax without approval u will get auto cheque refund. If u do it too much u will get iras warning letter.,btohqsg
