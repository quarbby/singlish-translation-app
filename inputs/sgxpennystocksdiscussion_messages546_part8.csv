ðŸš€Pika World Update- 6 October 2021ðŸš€ðŸ¤¼The Mysterious PerformanceIt isn't intuitive that tech stocks rose sharply even as the yield was also rising in the session. However  while the 10-year Treasury yield hit 1.53%  Nasdaq had a remarkable comeback and climbed 1.6%. This dynamic is interesting as we would have expected the index to tumble.It needs not to be ironic. First  tech stocks price tend to reflect the market expectation on the bond market. We see buyers scooping up shares after Monday's fall hit a level somewhat similar to the July sell-off when the index hit a bottom of 14 274.Second  such buying behaviour is also linked to investors expectations for the yield ahead. As of now  investors contend that the recent spike in bond yield may stabilise  and we could see the yield ranges around 1.46% to 1.54%. However  convincingly  a break above this level may bring us back to the 2021 high at 1.75%.Pika World continues to monitor the yield movement as we solidify our gains for the year.ðŸš˜EV Sector: Lordstown MotorsLordstown Motors seems to be struggling lately and further crashed after it was downgraded to sell by Morgan Stanley from $8 to $2  which was a big hit. In addition  the planned sales of its Ohio manufacturing facility for $230 million in cash is way less than the 20% value of the plant.The sale is primarily attributed to raising cash to introduce EV truck- Endurance into the market. Limited production is on the move in late 2021. However  the cash balance has been burning  and investors are concerned about the need to raise funds as it scales up production.Pika World remains cautious about the company as it had cut guidance before for its 2021 vehicle production.ðŸŽ™Facebook: Under Stress but Still a BuySeveral damaging reports from WSJ had dampened investors' appetite for its stocks. In addition  there have been concerns about its advertising businesses  significantly worsen in a choppy trading environment for technology stocks as inflation pushes interest rate expectation to rise.For one  the social impact of Facebook on users is under critical scrutiny as people turn attention to the merits and weaknesses of social media. While the stock continues to outperform in the long term  there is growing concern about how negative headlines weigh its prospect.As a whole  investors seem to place limited risk to its current business model  in particular to its advertising challenges and privacy crisis with Apple's change in their iOS. Pika World has not initiated any position in the stock  but Facebook does have a record of surprising negative sentiments with robust performance.ðŸ“®What's on the Menu Today?At 8.15 pm  we will have the ADP Non-Farm Payroll  which we expect to rise from 374K to 428K.10.30 pm brings us to Crude Oil Inventories which we expect a further drawdown of 0.300M.We will welcome FOMC Member Bostic to speak at 11.30 pm  which will be yet another possible insight on the economic health prospect in the US.It is 6 October  Tuesday  at 7.52 am in Singapore and 7.52 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a mooNATic week ahead!,btohqsg
