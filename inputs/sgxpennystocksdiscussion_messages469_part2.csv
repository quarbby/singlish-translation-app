Singaporean that invested condo in JB damn jialat no tenant want to sell cheaper than their purchased price but no buyers,btohqsg
Biggest problem is still the political issues...people vote for opposition  the opposition MP can be bought over and switch to other party one. one of the biggest flaw. By right if the MP want to jump to another party  they should renounce their seat and redo a vote.,btohqsg
