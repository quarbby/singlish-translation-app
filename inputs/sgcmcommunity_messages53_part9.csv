Neither do teslas and other EVs of similar price range get the same jealousy driven hate from them for being expensive,btohqsg
I think there are people still there,btohqsg
When a model Y dual motor with COE is close to 300k,btohqsg
I believe most have left already,btohqsg
I went by with my rickshaw,btohqsg
By the time i reach i be there sweeping the floor,btohqsg
Tesla brought in a new wave of car owners who never thought they would own a car,btohqsg
Or you meant new waves of richass,btohqsg
And the surge of phv and rental cars in recent years also diluted the quality of daily drivers e.g. taxi drivers. Even though its not like they are fantastic from the start,btohqsg
To be frank  when the model 3 launched  it was 150 or 160+ for the sr+,btohqsg
Agreed  as they are not in it for the driving  rather there as technology enthusiasts,btohqsg
The incentives and competitive nature of ride hailing services have really affected the driving skills of a lot of drivers who are rushing to complete more and more trips in a day,btohqsg
It was super good value for the tech and cool factor even if ur not into performance,btohqsg
The number of rich owners sprouting up,btohqsg
Especially after the costs they had to bear during the pandemic,btohqsg
And because others see this driving style and don't see much consequences  they follow suit in their private cars,btohqsg
Back then 150k i think would be cars like the honda accord  toyota camry kind of range?,btohqsg
That was also when the COE was basically down to 30 to 40k I believe,btohqsg
When the Model 3 came out,btohqsg
It was competing directly with the c180 and a4 with the A4 being around 135k with offers,btohqsg
Yeah probably  so i would say at least 60% of the car owners could afford it,btohqsg
Model 3 coming in at 150ish with fsd,btohqsg
Nobody knew that tesla would be so popular,btohqsg
Dont think so. It was 30k after the bidding hiatus. And it never looked back.,btohqsg
And the hongkie who tried to import in his tesla,btohqsg
Especially because at the time it was launched  a lot of car owners were looking at purchasing second cars  a lot of people were upgrading with money they would spend on other things now spent on cars and of course the tech enthusiasts,btohqsg
Cant be. Fsd was a 11k option before arf,btohqsg
So if u specced it it should be well over 160,btohqsg
And with the global hype created around Tesla with basically every other influencer having one and Elon musk having the command he does through twitter,btohqsg
The guy who started the trend,btohqsg
Oh sorry my bad  not fsd but the middle option that was available with some assists  not all the self driving features,btohqsg
Apparently not enough cos dogecoin never recovered,btohqsg
Just the regular autopilot i think,btohqsg
Anyway it just shows no matter what rules the govt come up with  people still own cars  still buy new cars.,btohqsg
I don't think he wanted it to recover,btohqsg
He clearly made significant personal gains from it,btohqsg
They should just cut us some slack by reducing cost of ownership  and let the citizens dig their own grave when traffic piles up everywhere  and then people might actually start taking public transport,btohqsg
There's always someone who is willing to pay the price,btohqsg
Not as obvious as the twitter sale. He could have shorted it before the hoohaa,btohqsg
Here's the issue with that  if the traffic does increase. People will just start blaming the government again and not all of these new owners will go back to using public transport,btohqsg
People will always be around to complain,btohqsg
The grass is always greener on the other side,btohqsg
But no matter what they do  people will still complain. So might as well let the poeple taste what would happen if measures are not in place,btohqsg
U cant tighten the belt forever,btohqsg
If cars became cheap enough to keep them at home and be weekend cars. I would gladly take public transport to work or anywhere,btohqsg
Just need to send them to places like Jakarta  Manila or many cities in India,btohqsg
Yuppp  but I guess we can't have everything now can we,btohqsg
Although I know of people who have purchased 2 or more cars under the classic car scheme,btohqsg
Maybe we should apply to work at LTA instead of sgcm,btohqsg
And they use them over the weekend,btohqsg
