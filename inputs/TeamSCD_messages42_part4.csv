but once i cruise go down again,btohqsg
yours like the other way round leh. haha,btohqsg
because for BMW they will intentionally let the coolant run hot during cruise to improve thermal efficiency.,btohqsg
Check coolant bro.. had this problem before,btohqsg
In the end coolant hose leak  sensor had issue,btohqsg
during hard driving  then the car will keep the temps lower.,btohqsg
i had the thermostat spring changed to the ftp racing one,btohqsg
then my normal temp was 100deg while cruising,btohqsg
only after ytd i had my v brace wrapped  had the fins behind the grills removed then tdy the car started running cold,btohqsg
by right here gt fins one,btohqsg
i doubt it affect much. just monitor coolant lo,btohqsg
i bought the coloured ones to cup over. didnt wrap 😂,btohqsg
haha the cold engine only started after the fins were removed,btohqsg
Better check. Too cold not good. Too hot not good also,btohqsg
it should affect at what temps do the radiator fans turn on....  On mine its like that  not sure if its the same for bmw,btohqsg
ya there could be a possibility but i was thinking since he only changed the thermostat spring  not sure if it affected the cooling management software. maybe got.,btohqsg
but only started after ytd haha,btohqsg
i used the upgraded springs for 2 mths my temps were at 100,btohqsg
i think best to monitor a while more before going to workshop.,btohqsg
