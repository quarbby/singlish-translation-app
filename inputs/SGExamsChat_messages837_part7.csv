so why didn't u drop out and go YI,btohqsg
there are two sides to every school,btohqsg
since u say it's not that easy,btohqsg
my year 1 experience wasn't bad,btohqsg
because I pretty much got brainwashed,btohqsg
I did well for the exams but they really weren't that hard,btohqsg
even if I dropped out it would still have been 3 years so I just continued,btohqsg
but it only started going downhill from year 2,btohqsg
everyone in my friend group didn't study and just left the school,btohqsg
so I felt that I was doing okay when actually I wasn't studying that hard,btohqsg
this one I cannot help you LOL,btohqsg
the school said that the friends you make in mi make or break your experience there,btohqsg
I just happened to be unlucky enough to find the wrong group,btohqsg
What makes you think some ppl in YI dont do this?,btohqsg
I feel that there's a larger group of people in YI that did okay for o levels,btohqsg
id find people with similar o Lvl score as me,btohqsg
there's also alot who choose yi because it's closer to their house,btohqsg
I'm not saying it's impossible to have a good time in MI or do well,btohqsg
I'm just trying to say MI isn't really a well known school  and alot of people really don't know anything about it's dark side before entering mi,btohqsg
so id like to make it more well known,btohqsg
doesn't mean they'll do okay for A levels?,btohqsg
again if you're talking about grades,btohqsg
the cold hard truth is that MI's grades are btr,btohqsg
u have your exp in MI,btohqsg
I'm p sure ppl have similarly bad exp in YI,btohqsg
I'm p sure a majority of people don't go into MI with rosy tinted glasses. they know the stigma  they've read reviews  and many of them do what they can do have a good experience or just study and get out w a decent A level cert,btohqsg
the cold hard truth for me is that as I'm preparing for a levels right now  I'm not using any of MIs resources and am self learning alot of topics,btohqsg
honestly why do you think other schools are better?,btohqsg
i have a feeling that because you hate mi  you imagine that every other jc HAS to be better  even yi,btohqsg
but that may not be the reality for students in those jcs,btohqsg
because I find JC resources more suitable for me,btohqsg
or people that I know in jc,btohqsg
i think what’s happening here is that every school’s notes have some gaps and flaws,btohqsg
lets say  you start off by using mi notes but dont understand the concept fully,btohqsg
then you try using another sch’s notes and they manage to fill in those gaps  which makes you think that sch notes are ‘better’,btohqsg
but lets say you used the other schs notes first. how do you know that sch notes doesnt have gaps of its own?,btohqsg
I simply cannot understand why you would think like that,btohqsg
Your assumption here is that everyone learns at the same pace as you do,btohqsg
Therefore jc good  mi bad. Mi 3 year waste of time,btohqsg
ok I should rephrase my words,btohqsg
Idk i just feel like you have a lot of prejudice that is clouding your fair judgement of MI,btohqsg
And thats your own experience and opinion  i respect that,btohqsg
But it doesnt mean itll be bad for everyone else,btohqsg
there really is a big difference between mi notes and JC notes,btohqsg
because mi tries to cater it to mi students,btohqsg
and yes  it may be enough to get 70rp,btohqsg
but not everyone is content with 70rp,btohqsg
Isnt that literally the point about learning,btohqsg
In MI if the notes aren't enough  then go look for other resources to supplement your learning,btohqsg
You cant expect the notes to have every single thing,btohqsg
