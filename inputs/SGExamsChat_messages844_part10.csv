cuz wwp is more towards punggo central,btohqsg
been experiencing a bunch of weird stuff since 2019,btohqsg
ya i rmbr punggol was quiet and peaceful,btohqsg
i also remembered visiting a see-saw made purely of woodworks around punggol end,btohqsg
probably at least nearly 10 years ago,btohqsg
sumang walk featured in news many times,btohqsg
i moved in around Q3/4 of 2017 and until the end of 2018  it was pretty serene,btohqsg
i consider sumang walk different from my area LOL,btohqsg
ok but seriously speaking right  this BTO at punggol that my dad bought from the 2nd time didn't have sumang walk as the official road name last time,btohqsg
i thought punggol walk was also known as sumang walk,btohqsg
lool this was edgedale plains & edgefield plains for me,btohqsg
might as well do a systemic naming process like sengkang,btohqsg
but i honestly prefer hougang  serangoon north & ang mo kio's naming of places,btohqsg
why i listed these areas is coz either me  and / or  my family  tends to frequent them a lot,btohqsg
coz when my family applied and had our BTO keys ready to collect  the road east actually called sumang walk,btohqsg
like the roads inside punggol way hor  around the 24hr u-stars supermarket (not the one nearby the lrt) that already shuttered their business operations there as well,btohqsg
it used to be referred as sumang lane,btohqsg
er  i only know serangoon north for budget stuff & the maisonettes (2-storey hdb flats),btohqsg
now it's listed as sumang walk,btohqsg
luckily gps is aware that sumnag lane is the unofficial road term for sumang walk,btohqsg
i only have trouble sleeping when i have smth on the next day keeping me up,btohqsg
oh ya  do you know the bus stop opposite twin waterfalls,btohqsg
last time it wasn't referred as blk 220c,btohqsg
i remember it being name as AFT TPE,btohqsg
before the addition of bus 39,btohqsg
ahh  then that's a pretty good sleep pattern,btohqsg
took bus 39 the whole route. regretted ...,btohqsg
u should just use bus 39 to travel in between yishun to punggol  punggol to pasir ris or pasir ris to tampines,btohqsg
that was the purpose of bus 39,btohqsg
Bus 39 can travel to yishun?,btohqsg
most of my sec sch peers use this transport to go to nyp frm punggol,btohqsg
Cus 39 cannot reach further north  only until yishun :/,btohqsg
otherwise if you choose direct bus services like bus 3  34  117 & 85  it'll be too long from punggol temp (bus)  inter(change)no. 3 heads from punggol int to pasir ris & tampinesno. 34 is a loop roundabout from punggol int through the tamp town areas  heading towards the terminals at changi airport and back to punggolbus 117 had the original route changed drastically to give way for the newer bus route 39  cause it was the only one of the two buses that came in the direction of punggol int TO yishun area & sembwang intbus 85 was literally a direct route from punggol to yishun  but also pretty long,btohqsg
i hope to enter nus or smu. ntu is too far.,btohqsg
nah  that's not advisable to follow through,btohqsg
ntu is gonna take me 2-2.45h to go to sch,btohqsg
unless u have spare 1-2 hours to sit through tampines TO yishun & yishun to tampines,btohqsg
I wld say that's fine also but nus and ntu has dorms sooo may wanna consider that also,btohqsg
i heard itâ€™s difficult to get the dorms,btohqsg
"Esp if you are the ""YAY SCH SPIRIT"" kind",btohqsg
plus the fucking interchange where it stations bus 39  is so fucking ulu,btohqsg
where the fuck is tampines concourse int,btohqsg
I wld say you need to be quite involved in sch*,btohqsg
not even residents living in tampines can certainly say for sure where it is,btohqsg
we are gg to have 3 mrt stations and 2 bus interchange,btohqsg
But if you dont plan on hall  is also fine,btohqsg
when bus 39 came into existence  tampine concourse alr existed,btohqsg
it was more of a depot holding area,btohqsg
I wonder if that is how my jc friends travel to tampines like that,btohqsg
were u from uh greendale or punggol sec,btohqsg
