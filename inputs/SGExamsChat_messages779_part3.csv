Wait you can drop out of bmt?,btohqsg
I thought youâ€™re forced to complete,btohqsg
So how do they decide which person needs to go for the 2 day asa course,btohqsg
Hi  with a 2.7/5 NUS High CAP (roughly equivalent to a 3.16 Poly GPA)  which Japanese unis could I realistically aim for?,btohqsg
In terms of university  I really have no idea,btohqsg
I don't go to the university in Japan and study so I have no idea how that system works,btohqsg
Ohhh r u that guy in japan,btohqsg
Someone talked abt working in Japan or smth briefly in this chat,btohqsg
nah  I'm not working in Japan yet  mayushii is,btohqsg
Then elab on the jap market Ish kinda iirc,btohqsg
I'm the guy currently working here in Japan,btohqsg
which majors do you think will have good job demand in about 5 to 6 years in Japan?,btohqsg
I rmb waseda has a 3.0/4 minimum requirement,btohqsg
Which major? I feel that CS is getting more popular in Japan now,btohqsg
Very cool sia y'all observe the firms or consumer  behaviour is it,btohqsg
I forgot but it's pretty cool,btohqsg
If you like engineering  Japan is something you might enjoy,btohqsg
the way you'd talked about it and stuff,btohqsg
How we are doing a form of order replenishment system,btohqsg
so CS and engineering (I hear telecoms engineering is big in Japan  but not sure which SG uni degrees are good prep for that) should be the two big directions  right?,btohqsg
tbf living costs  even in Tokyo  are also cheaper,btohqsg
There are actually a lot of startups in Japan ngl,btohqsg
Actually does Japan have a pension service?,btohqsg
Of course they want someone with the experience so going as a fresh grad is not really advisable,btohqsg
Or does it work like IRA accounts,btohqsg
Especially since yen is getting way weaker now,btohqsg
We do have the pension system in Japan,btohqsg
It really depends on the company and the department,btohqsg
To the point I feel actually working in SG is worse than in Japan in terms of WLB,btohqsg
As to how much btr.... ^ again?,btohqsg
A bit personal but mayushi do u plan to come back sg when you are older or are you gnna stay in japan 4eva,btohqsg
sg wlb is ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ for 90% of the population,btohqsg
oh is that your observation and/or based on exp,btohqsg
Opens up to check. First thing pops up Issues of Non payment,btohqsg
Of course coming back to SG,btohqsg
One example is probably the WFH thingy in Singapore news these days,btohqsg
There's some news or study that showed sgreans kinda tired on a daily basis,btohqsg
Like probably the stance for some firms in Singapore is complete work at office in SG,btohqsg
But in Japan it is more of a flexible working hours,btohqsg
Heck even the traditional ones are pretty flexible,btohqsg
Nah I going niall horan one concert,btohqsg
And most companies stance these days is half WFH and half work at office these days,btohqsg
Like your official working hours is 9.15am to 6.15pm for example,btohqsg
But you can come early and go home early,btohqsg
Or even earlier like 7am to 4pm,btohqsg
Or you can come in later like 10am to 7pm,btohqsg
Obviously it is subjected to if the office is open by then,btohqsg
this is Japan. I bet the trains don't run that early even,btohqsg
But for people like me working from home  yes I started work at 6am before,btohqsg
Heck I have a colleague who comes to the office at 6.45am before,btohqsg
