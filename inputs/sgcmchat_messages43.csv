Its like gg for a ride w/o speed,btohqsg
right ??  like what to do after that. js come  say hi je,btohqsg
lol if u think a meet is boring without pops idk what kinda meet u want,btohqsg
the best meets are fri nights at ecp,btohqsg
it‚Äôs peaceful and with proper petrolheads,btohqsg
the reason why i chose the place is cos its private uh  but since theyre kind of against open meets then i might jst make it private,btohqsg
Car meet nowadays all just SHOW OFF YOUR CAR,btohqsg
if u wanna put urself out there to be accountable for people who disobey u idt that‚Äôs very wise,btohqsg
Just want to see who louder,btohqsg
after all u still in sec sch,btohqsg
i mean ... do u wna come to a meet just to talk?,btohqsg
Idk to me car comm and bike comm,btohqsg
ya daswhy so i jst discuss with the management first lo,btohqsg
Bike comm we all sit tgt talk one,btohqsg
if not then i jst host private lo small small,btohqsg
Car comm mainy in their own grp,btohqsg
is u putting urself out there,btohqsg
nola. if got nothing happening in the meet  it's like boring no?,btohqsg
Haha hi bye kirekan mcm tu,btohqsg
one yp come w a popping vios,btohqsg
Ofc ppl wanna show off their car,btohqsg
u gonna take accountability for everyone?,btohqsg
They feel nice when ppl compliment their car mah,btohqsg
oh wow ur pop is very loud,btohqsg
i think the carros meet im not gonna do it bruh,btohqsg
like that stay home play game,btohqsg
loud pops and good proper sound is different,btohqsg
eh@k4gesno point getting blamed for everyone ah. some people wldnt listen so its better to safe to just not do it,btohqsg
I nvr say abt the pops mah,btohqsg
Ppl can actually tell the diff of what u do to ur engine all just by the sound of it when they rev,btohqsg
im jst gna host one at ECP maybe jst maybe some of yall then go eat 711 HAHA,btohqsg
wyt bsmnt don‚Äôt do regular meets anym,btohqsg
Singapore needs smarter people that‚Äôs all,btohqsg
can . no one said cannot . go ahead if you feel like it la   but honestly lesser people wld come if theres nothing happening,btohqsg
if u been in itn from the start you‚Äôd know that meets used to be fun and civilised,btohqsg
but lets not fight over this ah,btohqsg
Then that‚Äôs too bad for the host or whether or not he cares?,btohqsg
The ones who wld mainly talk abt car are the ones who owns a car,btohqsg
less people would comemore petrolheads would show up,btohqsg
If spotters come i doubt they wld wanna sit n talk all tgt yk,btohqsg
They come and shout at owner to rev,btohqsg
cos this grp 75% spotters ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
petrolheads = car owners right? sorry i blur abit,btohqsg
honestly after the restrictions die down,btohqsg
Dun be such a pessimist ler...,btohqsg
then they will kp if the owner don‚Äôt rev,btohqsg
not good to take risk tho,btohqsg
stupid things people do at stupid carmeets,btohqsg
But tats still kinda unfair for those who are actually passionate abt cars,btohqsg
ok sorry carmeets not stupid mb,btohqsg
If u dw take responsibility for whatever happens if it happens then just dun host yet,btohqsg
I beg to differ abt the part where they say no rev and all ah tbvh,btohqsg
yeah i alr said i backing out lol,btohqsg
U can host tbvh if u pandai2 ler,btohqsg
i mean idm hosting one chill one at ECP at night la we jst hangout,btohqsg
people that go to car meets for pop and bangs never go proper car meet before,btohqsg
cars n coffee was chill that time then got some cars rev rite?,btohqsg
after that one meet in july it‚Äôs been ok,btohqsg
The ones who complained were parents,btohqsg
the ones that complained were the owners,btohqsg
last i remembered there weren‚Äôt many parents there,btohqsg
wow.. its so hard for people not to rev and do stupid shit in crowded places,btohqsg
kinda wished i join the car community earlier lol,btohqsg
Rlly like these limited edition lights sia,btohqsg
Even my motor grp we rev and all,btohqsg
Not cuz wan see who loudest,btohqsg
lol lc135 very loud but not fast,btohqsg
Riders love to hear their own bikes,btohqsg
Im sure even drivers love it,btohqsg
If not why did they mod their cars,btohqsg
our community going to shit alr,btohqsg
pop and bang until any modified car does anyth stupid media coverage alr,btohqsg
Non enthu YP and all come flow with tiktok and flood car scene,btohqsg
U can host a meet annonymously tbvh,btohqsg
We bikers do it many times,btohqsg
cos in sg private meet also end up spreading like wildfire,btohqsg
0808 tuas the venue also supp be private,btohqsg
Deadass says on the poster HAHA,btohqsg
Idt they meant it as private2 i think morebof private property,btohqsg
supposed to have priv entry code,btohqsg
but still impressive how many cars they fit in what seemed like a small carpark HAHA,btohqsg
I go rounding2 outside wif my grp,btohqsg
Haha kewak a lot sia the cars outside,btohqsg
and the ones that take up space are the mpv crossover groups,btohqsg
then what if it goes wrong that guys gets beaten up by carros ah,btohqsg
tbf they know the risks theyre getting,btohqsg
whoever gonna drag ur ‚Äòbrand‚Äô in the mud,btohqsg
media will be on ur ass too espc in sg,btohqsg
i dont even consider this a brand lol tbh but ya gg,btohqsg
that time few guys kena caught for rounding but had more media coverage then drug busts,btohqsg
u know what i mean la,btohqsg
bro honestly i only did SCM cos some comments on my tiktok jst say abt how they dk where meets are so i made SCM then made video to spread it,btohqsg

Idk how i feel after editing this,btohqsg

the edits that take forever to do gets no views one,btohqsg
then the edits that take like 3mins to do always have the most views,btohqsg
THE ONE U PUT NO EFFORT MORE POPULAR,btohqsg
But when like p1 kids uses templates and say in their bio they took 3 hours to do this,btohqsg
bro the worst is those that take content and other ideas from other people,btohqsg
then just stitch them together to get views,btohqsg
The fact that I keep doing the joker face video thinking I‚Äôm cool,btohqsg
if ur in hdc you‚Äôll know what i mean,btohqsg

Eh is there a way to see when someone joins a grp,btohqsg
iw shifter but thrustmaster shifter make my wallet cry,btohqsg
Karl Gosling say not realistic feel,btohqsg
for what ppl buy fanatic when they only play forza or smt,btohqsg
i was gna get PXN V9 cos damn cheap with shifter  wheel pedal but the angle of the steering wheel and no force feedback threw me off,btohqsg
yeah i realised i still researching HAHA,btohqsg
i damn new to sim setups so ya,btohqsg
when ram people off the mountain will have feedback? üåö,btohqsg
Oh the 20 000rpm 250cc CBR250RR,btohqsg
If u after 200+ is G27/G29  dont reco t150,btohqsg
only time ill ever be able to touch fanatec is in the singapore gp HAHA,btohqsg
Impossible to find new that cheap,btohqsg
g29 wheels at 200 the quality also mehhhh,btohqsg
better not buy used ah imo,btohqsg
t150 is the ps4 version of tmx,btohqsg
The wheel really small. Reco the t300 if u can save up ah,btohqsg
but i honestly dont suggest g29 ah,btohqsg
cause if u change the wheel,btohqsg
the force feedback can feel its lesser,btohqsg
when i used the stock g29 wheel,btohqsg
but when i change the wheel to momo wheel,btohqsg
i feel like the force feedback got lesser ah,btohqsg
the wheel so much bigger and heavier,btohqsg
It‚Äôs obv easier to turn since more torque from user end,btohqsg
no matter what ur base is u wheel swap the ffb will decrease,btohqsg
My setup i using 13 inch vertex rep wheel,btohqsg
Gain on AC is at 100,btohqsg

yep i got for like 15?nidk,btohqsg
10 bucks is 10 bucks ah. honestly 3d printed is cheaper,btohqsg
from brothers friend laa thats why,btohqsg
I changing to SHH shifter in a while,btohqsg
by any chance u changing to the thrustmaster shifter?,btohqsg
The throw is too long for my taste,btohqsg
ok wait i see what u send first,btohqsg
Wait guys whole setup estimate cost how much ah,btohqsg
whole setup? cheapest is probably 300 with stand,btohqsg
Yes like with the wheel  shifter n pedals,btohqsg
unless u find some old one,btohqsg
I thought would be like in the high thousands range,btohqsg
i not expert in this stuff ah,btohqsg
that's if u get higher end,btohqsg
That is mostly pro DD wheels and LC pedals,btohqsg
Logitech ones is middle ah i guess,btohqsg
I believe trustmaster and logitec both have entry level and mid,btohqsg
my motivation gonna die in 10 mins alr,btohqsg
