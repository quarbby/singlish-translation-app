Has ur pad run in yet?,btohqsg
U need to run in for awhile,btohqsg
Its not drive 5k without braking run in leh😅,btohqsg
Do it on an empty road,btohqsg
If it still squeaks maybe its ur pads not good.. high metal content or smth,btohqsg
Need to skim the rotor disc,btohqsg
If brake pad no issue then need go shop check already. Maybe poor installation or rust or smthing,btohqsg
If the sound getting louder and louder  then better go asap,btohqsg
Basically  in the morning or after work then drive off from a time from carpark,btohqsg
Mine also have sound  especially when the car just start up. When i go servicing and change my wheel bearing   the mechanic never say anything about the brake pad. Is for few months already  since no issue i just take it old car issue,btohqsg
If worry just get it check  if rim damage then need forkout additional 1k plus to change,btohqsg

Can see from the current listings. You see other place put how much for their depre and compare to yours. Some place put higher depre because they guarantee certain guarantee (example engine & transmission for carro and inchcape) while some will throw in free servicing etc.,btohqsg
