And want to be workers party ah??? Want to wear blue to represent blue collar??? And dun want yo accept a challenge??,btohqsg
Anyway it’s not a universal debate... it’s just about some policies,btohqsg
If it’s some new small party I can understand but this is the WP that we are talking about,btohqsg
Anyone working in container trucking line? Company manager or control or boss Please pm me need to rent a equipment for tomorrow,btohqsg
@nixnaydon borther about him   the way iron man talk   show that he is very naive and stupid  talk him more will vomit blood. Talk to wall better than talk to him,btohqsg
Leadership renewal is hard lah. LTK was second gen  rising from the ashes after JBJ. Pritam's age can tank at least another 20 years  and so can the new candidates. The 2020 WP slate is like 2011 to me. But I understand how the Chinese ed might feel,btohqsg
Duh know if Aljunied can tahan the PaP assault,btohqsg
WP is sending a racist to contest Sengkang Punggol?,btohqsg
It's easy to understand now why Lim Tean was a highly renowned Cambridge educated lawyer,btohqsg
anyone went through a muslim divorce before? can share the procedures?,btohqsg
Wow... That is not a good look for them,btohqsg
Next election should have even odd system. Even number serial number pap  odd serial number lamp post opposition,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification.As much I think WP has many good candidates  mud slinging from any sides is degrading to the person who threw the mud.How can anyone expect to change someone's mind through mud slinging? It only reveals one's true character.Just hope the person who cut that video will be apprehended for trying to instill unrest through deception.,btohqsg
Lim Tean wants to make a lot of money when PV is successful.His friend n supporter will be at the centre of it.,btohqsg
Please explain how he can make a lot of money from this? Sounds like a ridiculous accusation,btohqsg
What video? Care to quote the exact lines which backs up what you say - on how he's going to make money from this?,btohqsg
If you are unable to quote and back up your ridiculous assertion then you're just a lying liar,btohqsg
Haha another complicit lying liar who is unable to back up falsehoods resorting to asking people to shut up,btohqsg
"For the record it should be made clear under a correction order that this is a falsehood said by ""Seetoh Yew"" 😅",btohqsg
hahahahahahaha shut up lah u JAHAHAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I have seen a number of LimTean videos and he come across as one of the more caring and credible alternative members. So I dont believe this accusation.,btohqsg
Lol the author of the article doesn't even reveal her name or face like in most credible blogs or sources. The author has only 3 articles and 7 followers. And you sharing this garbage?,btohqsg
Exactly he has more to lose actually. Lim tean is a Cambridge educated lawyer who did well in his profession. If he wanted to make money he could have just continued doing that,btohqsg
SHUT UP and Vote for JOTUN!,btohqsg
I sense a few heart attacks coming up. U pple need to chill lolz,btohqsg
JOTUN apologize. It’s time to move on,btohqsg
Thot he was sued for 100 odd thousand?,btohqsg

Okie.... impressive indeed.... and sorry btw the case was last year and seems like it’s a misunderstanding,btohqsg
just say three time I divorce you,btohqsg
I heard is it true ?,btohqsg
Anyway did u ever seen a Dr in Singapore who is poor! 😂😂,btohqsg
Dunno if I one day become Dr I tell u lor,btohqsg
got la  there's one kena bankrupt last time no?,btohqsg
Dr  lawyer  accountant who is under bankruptcy is not a professional anymore and I don't think they can renew their practicing licenses! So what are u talking about any person who is under bankruptcy still can call themselves a Dr? 😂,btohqsg
I don't think u know the Singapore professional practicing regulations  else can u name any doctor is still practicing while still undischarged from bankruptcy!,btohqsg
I don't think you mentioned anything about practicing here,btohqsg
We mention Dr and not those who are bankruptcy and not a Dr anymore... Even GE 2020 candidates also can't be a undischarged bankruptcy person in sg !,btohqsg
Hey guys   how are you? 😊👋,btohqsg
If she did things like Jolovan Wham of course she won't kena deep deep like him. She is well connected enough and can afford to hire Senior Counsel  or team of SC  or request Queens Counsel from UK to come in.  She's being humble in acknowledging hard truths,btohqsg
