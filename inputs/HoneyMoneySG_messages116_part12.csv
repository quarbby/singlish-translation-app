what does UOB merchants mechanics meant? sorry. i'm an amateur on this.,btohqsg
Ofc. Disclaimer: better to use UOB lady with the right cat for uob merchant.,btohqsg
When you use a UOB card on a UOB$ merchant  it will give you UOB$ cashback instead of UNI$The UOB$ cashback is lackluster for some of the merchants and also you only get the cashback on your next visit like favepay hence why people would ask to avoid using them or use the amaze if possible with Mastercard version if your purpose is to get miles instead of the cashbackFor exampleBreadTalk give 3% back instead and you will forgo 4mpd if using PPVBut if you have UOB ladies and VS it a different story where only base point 0.4 mile is convert to UOB$ but the bonus point is still given,btohqsg
Certain cards u only lose the base miles at uob$ merchant,btohqsg
Yeah was about to add that part in,btohqsg

Hey guys  how's the experience using FlyAnywhere in Heymax?,btohqsg
I tried Living in Malaysia without Cash (as a foreigner)https://youtu.be/88wU3ADSUEQ,btohqsg
Which ewallet app for m'sia more friendly  Grab or tng?,btohqsg
Around the same  TnG works more like Alipay for Malaysia  Grab is more integrated for Food and transport and one less app to download on phone.,btohqsg
One good thing about TnG is can transfer unused balance topped up from debit card,btohqsg
but TnG ewallet has top-up fees from credit cards,btohqsg
with the ewallet providers continuing to waive the MDR fees  cashless probably has better penetration there than in sg,btohqsg
did you have to sign up for another grab account to use the ewallet function? i recall if you've ever gotten the GPMC in SG  your grabpay would basically be locked in to SGD and unable to transact in MYR,btohqsg
How did he even choose 6th? Cardup block the dates,btohqsg
Can Amaze + CRMC be used for iPhone in-app purchases?,btohqsg
Didnt need to  but i unlocked it quite a while ago during the early stage. things may be different now,btohqsg
why not just use your CRMC directly? it's not an apple pay purchasee: i presume your in-app purchases are purchases in mobile games or similar,btohqsg
Probably to prevent the odd treatment of apple pay / google pay by Citi,btohqsg
i.e. Kris+ isn't recognized as online if using CRMC directly,btohqsg
need to differentiate if it's an apple pay purchase  or app store purchase. app store purchases are fine,btohqsg
should be app store purchase since anyway amaze cannot be put into apple pay,btohqsg
You can actually.  But for Apple Pay app-related purchases. Not sure how Apple/Google differentiates cause theoretically app store purchase goes through Apple Pay,btohqsg
you can add amaze to apple pay?,btohqsg
I do. (And use it to pay for my Apple Music),btohqsg
sir that's not apple pay  that's apple ID payment 😁,btohqsg
Settings > Profile > Payment & Shipping > Add from there,btohqsg
the differentiator is basically  does the card go into your apple wallet?,btohqsg
But that said  in app purchases would go through apple ID payment what 😅,btohqsg
Not sure how Citi sees this so... good luck 😜,btohqsg
yup this is the gray area...because IAP can use your Apple ID CC directly...or go thru Apple Pay,btohqsg
we wouldn't be discussing this confusing thing if CRMC didn't have that strange mobile wallet exclusion 🤪,btohqsg
https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/liveplus/HSBC has a new cashback card to offer,btohqsg
Yeah we discussing more of direct citi hahaha,btohqsg
bobian lo  but then again they are literally the only option to accept amaze as a blanket online solution so... live with it 😂,btohqsg
Think of it like a quirk of your partner. Deal with it and move on 😂,btohqsg
Doesnt matter actually. If your salary is credited on the last day of the month  you'll clock the $500 increase in MAB next month.,btohqsg
Note that they use monthly average balance  so you cannot just top-up $500 on 1st July  then spend $500 on 2nd July.,btohqsg
oh really? wouldn’t it be calculated in that current month instead of the next?,btohqsg
If say ur current month 30k  end of the month ur salary come in and have 32k  ur average balance for the month is still 30k only  one day extra abit wont change ur monthly average by muchThen the following monthBalance of prev month = 30kCurrent balance = 32kAlready 2k increaseIs not based on ending balance of prev month  is 500 extra over the average of previous month,btohqsg
Month 1:- Balance $5000- Salary in on 31st $1000- MAB = ($5000×30 + $6000)/31=$5032Month 2:- Balance $6000- Salary in on 31st $1000- MAB = ($6000×30 + $7000)/31=$6032Your MAB from Month1 to Month2 has increased  even if salary is credited at the end of the month.,btohqsg
this is better than UOB one?,btohqsg
Yes  provided you don’t do any outgoing transaction that reduce your amount to the point where even your salary doesn’t cover. Just set up a recurring transfer to ocbc every month can liao what,btohqsg
this card is mainly competing against Citi Cashback card i feel.but caveat is the 8% is only until December 2024. Thereafter 5% only.,btohqsg
