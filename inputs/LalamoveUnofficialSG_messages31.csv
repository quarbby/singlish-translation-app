Ya man. To pay seller for the iPhone üòï,btohqsg
Of course reported. But now  Lalamove push blame on customer and me. Refuse to compensate... trip was $30. Only willing to pay. 1/4 of the delivery fee.,btohqsg
Wasted two hours of time and petrol. Then lost $150 plus $30 delivery fee sia... feeling damn cheated.,btohqsg
Police says got others affected by the same scam.,btohqsg
Ya always have this kind of orders one,btohqsg

Lalamove Valentine's Day Special Flower DeliveryCommit to auto assigned bulk orders on 14 February 2021!9 to 15 stops per driver (Exact no. of orders will be confirmed when we call you)Fill up the form below to indicate interest today -https://form.jotform.com/210200025304430,btohqsg
Don't know eh tio conn bo,btohqsg
Dun waste ur time to read la,btohqsg
Lalamove should make every CSO do one day of deliveries per month using a company vehicle. Then they'll understand what the person on the ground goes thru,btohqsg
No such thingYou have every right to demand payment before deliveryEven if u send first u no need to complete the job in your app,btohqsg
The only thing cs can/will do is they say they investigateBut if customer dont respond they will jus tell u make police report,btohqsg
Oh I can don't complete the order and carry on take jobs ?,btohqsg
"Pls note that if job indicates ""COD"" service (the purple icon)  it does not refer to us - it refers to COD between buyer and sellerIt is an ""additional service"" where we help seller collect cash upon delivery to buyerSo do not let customer make u think u must deliver first then they pay you",btohqsg
Which means its definitely no wrong to collect payment from the first location am I right ?,btohqsg
Unless it is recipient who is paying,btohqsg
But what if cus refuse to pay,btohqsg
Not sure what cs will say though  u can try,btohqsg
But if cancel job need reason right,btohqsg
Ya unlike grab  bad weather also can cancel lol,btohqsg
Lol dk what I should do alr,btohqsg
Say WhatsApp her but still no reply,btohqsg
If its recipient  u know her address u can go ambush her lol,btohqsg
Some ppl very chao kuan one lar  if u feel its worth it go ambush her lo,btohqsg
Other than that  cs wont be able to do anything,btohqsg
If me i jus let it go take it as charity to her and it is her karma to bear,btohqsg
I had a few incidents.... just whatsapp politely and keep asking,btohqsg
Problem is they take a few days to pay 14 or 16,btohqsg
But my advise CS waste time,btohqsg

Anyone have any news of holiday surcharge coming?,btohqsg
Why viamove orders also come into lalamove lol,btohqsg
No didntJust saw 2 that said viamove order under remarks,btohqsg
is it on purpose? by instruction? why make it so difficult for us at times when they can easily check that it is the customers who are at the wrong?,btohqsg
Customer is king what. Even if customer is at fault  the most is gentle reminder. You think they will piss off customer just for us? Later customer went to other platform  they loss money. Driver partner can easily replace as there are many willing to suck up and do like most of us.,btohqsg
Just like secured zone. Customer confirm don't want pay extra. So most of them try luck. Why can't secured zone auto add inside base on the pick up or drop off location?,btohqsg
CBD can auto add  this one cannot. lol,btohqsg
There was once  it was raining heavily and after delivering the food to the customer and back to my car. I received call frm CS  asking if food has been delivered  the tone was quite harsh and keep asking me qns bout who i pass the food to? When did u pass? I have to shout back and affirm it was delivered  then CS tone changed to friendly.Cause im sure the client called to complain why so long  and im sure was within the time frame.,btohqsg
Wow sounds like some of the CS really quite CB,btohqsg

Anyone of you who drives  but picks up a motorcycle job  and finds that the payload should have been in the car category?,btohqsg
How do you go about resolving that? I try calling the useless hotline but nobody is there for all 3 languages.Then LiveChat they say I need to sort it out with the customer,btohqsg
This particular customer took ages to pick up phone. Knock at door 15 mins then his maid open door. By the time I rmb it‚Äôs motorcycle job  I alrdy drive off liao,btohqsg
In the end i just suck thumb do the job lo,btohqsg

Anyone using rental cars? New guy here any recommendations?,btohqsg
Hi would like to ask how much u can make with llm and working after 6pm everyday for a few hrs and full day on sat? planning to rent a car while interning as working area is damn fa,btohqsg
Plan to just pay off the car  petrol all and maybe make a few bucks,btohqsg
I work 1-3orders during wkday ($30max)  work 5-6hrs wkend (best so far $70-$80). Im considered quite picky and slack as a benchmark. Hope that helps,btohqsg
How much is your rent for the car?,btohqsg
im looking at the lalamove car rental program  35> orders  $315 so like 1.2k per month? might find coe car too,btohqsg
thanks for ur input im also quite slacky so this helps üôèüèº,btohqsg
That means just rental alone  u have to bring in $40/day.,btohqsg
is it worth? or do i look for other rental places? How much avg can earn if work 3 hours a day on weekdays and 8 hours on a saturday,btohqsg
3 hours wkdays cant earn much. Also it depends on few factors.1. Where u stay (some locations dont have much jobs supply)2. Ur 3hrs is what time to what time (normally early morning  after 8pm oso not much jobs available),btohqsg
I stay in west area. i plan to start around 6-7pm until 10pm. But weekend will chiong whole day,btohqsg
6pm-7pm can pick 1 or 2 jobs. After 8pm lalamove dead  v little to no jobs,btohqsg
But 6-10pm grab food confirm alot of jobs if u camp at jurong point or jem/westgate haha,btohqsg
is this better than doing grabhitch or ryde? i heard grabfood with car also not bad,btohqsg
I only know legally u can only do 2 trips of grabhitch/ ryde per day.,btohqsg
I think not feasible la. If u take into consideration 1-2 days cant work for whatever reason. Too tight liao,btohqsg
Might as well get a bicycle do grabfood. Less stress n earn more to keep,btohqsg
Rather than pay to rental company,btohqsg

Does the app show what are the items before you accept?,btohqsg
Or long items like a roll of paper/vinyl sticker  poles (seriously delivered a pole for hang clothes b4 lol),btohqsg
Not always  only if customer put in remarks,btohqsg
This one must be bike order no one take bo pian upgrade to car order lol,btohqsg
Ya this kind must spot and aim ü§£U see those bike order hang there no one take  suddenly become car order u straightaway accept,btohqsg
Yeah. But not all will change. They will be thick skin to wait for ppl to accept the order,btohqsg
Car for me not worth to do motor multi stop,btohqsg
Everytime I accept one order come another better order.,btohqsg
Ya lo everyone else kan cheong +$4 +$8 liao then will have 1 joker still waiting for rider to accept their $10.30 job ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
So must accept already then can see what are the items?Any penalty for cancellation?,btohqsg
If valid reason can. If not suspend. I think,btohqsg
Har? Cancel how many times to get suspended?Because I don‚Äôt want to take heavy or large items.Should I register as motorbike better?,btohqsg
Or unless its regular customer u know the shop and what productsIf not u only know after acceptThe assumption is that customers ask to deliver only what is allowed and follow weight/dimension,btohqsg
You can take bike orders now also with car acct,btohqsg
Or u can just take orders from restaurants to avoid bulky stuff,btohqsg

Looking for referral code and car driver for start up guidance.,btohqsg

You have toYou cant skip this step in the app,btohqsg
Anyone saw an order with pick up location at bt timah hill,btohqsg
Guys  ask you all  can bike shop repossession your bike when LTA haven't update new Road  tax when was paid over weekend?,btohqsg
Bike shop as in mechanic? Whats it got to do with them,btohqsg
Bike shop where I purchase from them  there's still installments,btohqsg
Anyone come across such black shop?,btohqsg
Got to read your purchase agreement t&c  they prob have right to repossess if payments overdue,btohqsg
Guys. I keep getting damn far pick up. Anybody face the same issue?,btohqsg
It's not an issue  LLM is like that.,btohqsg
No lah lolololFirst see your locationIf everyday same time same issue maybe u jus camping wrong spotIf u dont think its loc issue then maybe check your phone gps,btohqsg
If u keep getting jobs not just faraway but always from same area  it could be your gps is lagging and stuck in those locations,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the explanation.,btohqsg
If during peak hr shouldnt be like that  maybe need to check your phone üòÖ,btohqsg
Wtf customer ask send some cooking stuff half size,btohqsg
The help line damn useless. I chat with them  they say please provide evidence I call the merchant to confirm specs and dimensions of payload. If never confirm then must suck it up,btohqsg
That time I kena one. Description say 12 wine glasses. Turns out it‚Äôs 2 boxes of it. I told live chat that if I turn up with bike  the only way I can transport this rubbish is if I tie pallet jack behind the motorbike,btohqsg
The hotline haoseow one. Spend 1 minute telling you they overwhelmed cos it‚Äôs COVID19 and they are essential service. Then regardless you choose English Chinese or Malay  there is nobody to take your call,btohqsg
If you got trolley on your bike  easier to transport. That's their logic. Bike deliver potted flowers  easiest way is to put on top of helmet.,btohqsg
This one he hope car will take,btohqsg
I realise there's another trick customers do to smoke screen - when they help you put the item in your vehicle. The item may not be oversized but when u arrive at drop off and finally hold the item and its obviously overweight....Then u realise why they so helpful at pickup,btohqsg
So make sure u personally handle every item when loading so that u know if its way too heavy üòÖ,btohqsg
The fare n system is getting worse,btohqsg
$7.75 sure or not. Car somemore,btohqsg
Even take bus not worth it,btohqsg

Actually liddis ok right? Since they paynow first.,btohqsg
Or is it supposed to be have purchasing service,btohqsg
No this one is transaction between buyer and sellerSo i think in this case buyer is the one who booked order  and request rider to pay seller first upon pick up,btohqsg
If he paynow first then okBut he say paynow only after cfmMeans rider need pay first...?,btohqsg
Thats why a lot of ppl misunderstand the COD serviceIts supposed to be rider help collect cash upon delivery  not help pay first then get paid upon delivery,btohqsg
Yes rider pay first   they indicate note so customers no wrong if we taken this pick   smart move lao jiao,btohqsg
But i always dont understand why need liddatEven if seller dont have paynow  surely got bank acct  buyer can tfr,btohqsg
They want to save purchases order money kwa,btohqsg
No need purchase order what  they can still pay first then rider jus go pick up,btohqsg
Never ask u go inside shop to shopping,btohqsg
If wallet safe   if cash need collect money first üòÅ,btohqsg
Ya la so much taiji  end up this kind best jus skip dont take haha,btohqsg

Do they pay more if the item is heavier?,btohqsg
Ah thanks. Cos in the training they said must follow their route.,btohqsg
Lol u dont anyhow  wait tio complain,btohqsg
Yes because the sequence affects the pricing  becos price based on dist.  Customers also have their reasons why they want a certain seq... So best is dont accept if u dont agree with the seq,btohqsg
Yeah sometimes they remark follow route üòÖ,btohqsg
I‚Äôm referring to the driving route. Not the sequence of delivery places.,btohqsg
This 18:00 hrs  is it time that must reach the recipient? How about sender?,btohqsg
OhYou can use any route u want mahNow they say must follow their travel route?,btohqsg
In the training video it said.I asked cos sometimes training video is old and they didn‚Äôt update with changes.,btohqsg
Ohh. Then what about the time required to send recipient?,btohqsg
Are we allowed to pick up more than 1 order in the same area?Or only can take one at a time?,btohqsg
Can stack. Usually within 1 hr,btohqsg
But stack at ur own risk. Best dont stack more than 2. Unless really all nearby,btohqsg
All these with +$ what is it?,btohqsg
Is there any way to stop the screen from jumping?How do you guys look at orders when the screen keeps jumping?Also there is no way to filter anything?Like future orders.Or location.,btohqsg
Extra money for u to earn. Usually is nearing to pick up timing but no driver yet,btohqsg
