ur tank big is ok ba,btohqsg
i pump alr come back home maybe 1/4 tank gone,btohqsg
I pump jb come back can drive 100km then need to go back jb,btohqsg
If I want to be a model citizen that follow 3/4,btohqsg
To me not worth the worry going in empty whether kena caught,btohqsg
catch 1 time the fine also not cheap,btohqsg
and you must u turn go back singapore,btohqsg
Don't want ppl say got money buy car no money pump petrol,btohqsg
"Or ""Got money buy car  no money pay carpark""",btohqsg
Roi intake i want see the difference,btohqsg
You have gauges iin your car?,btohqsg
Wah i kenna erp that day left 1.49 cents then 2 dollar erp cannot deduct now sitting duck waiting for the fine paper,btohqsg
Esso98 for me for past decade or so,btohqsg
This one got many like this,btohqsg
should be able to track intake volume,btohqsg
I know. I got a few friends like that also,btohqsg
Ltr i want food and come btw,btohqsg
you try to set your gauge to show intake vol first,btohqsg
then we see if there's any diff,btohqsg
Go do the erp one that key in your iu number. So no money also it can deduct from your card for erp,btohqsg
i think should have one la,btohqsg
I also wish can don't pay parking  going to work is Abt $200 monthly,btohqsg
i rather not take the risk,btohqsg
but my friends all so far also nv kena caught,btohqsg
tailgate  park double yellow  park open air no coupon.,btohqsg
basically dont pay for cp at all one,btohqsg
Ya... My season parking is $197. But I found an outside carpark $10 per day. So every day I leave early or don't go office I save. Down side is it's outdoor,btohqsg
Kana one time orh Kong...can park whole week rate,btohqsg
Sound abt there for season parking rate,btohqsg
His logic is  means you nv illegally park enough to cover your orkong,btohqsg
go malaysia also empty tank one,btohqsg
caught a few times alr but still continue,btohqsg
also same logic  means you nv pump enough petrol to cover your orkong,btohqsg
Mine daily driven not park at carpark showcase typeüòÇ,btohqsg
i rather have predictable expenses la. every month how much for carpark and petrol,btohqsg
Daily drive also need to park,btohqsg
rather than dk when i'll kena fine,btohqsg
Hope his wallet n heart strong enuff when he go to court in the near future üòÅ,btohqsg
ltr sibei suay 1 month kena 2 or 3 times,btohqsg
Free parking is the best parking,btohqsg
I dun like to contribute more than needed to the govt coffersüòÇ,btohqsg
I don't mind paying petrol  but I hate paying parking,btohqsg
I rather give to charities üòÅ,btohqsg
My recent site at marina bay,btohqsg

He say is for condo gate,btohqsg
Looks like this month will be esso for me,btohqsg
but the ICA officer press  the needle go down,btohqsg
whether he jailed or fine  idk,btohqsg
they see random buttons will also ask you click one,btohqsg
I got random buttons under my dash,btohqsg
But your friend also 2pid to put in boot,btohqsg
they click click nothing happen can alr,btohqsg
I ask the previous owner  he said it was to cut the camera power,btohqsg
I got condo gate remote in my cup holder,btohqsg
He off when he do og in the past,btohqsg
But my camera all changed already so no use,btohqsg
why he need to off. Dont download can alr ma,btohqsg
He don't want there and then get caught they can check,btohqsg
So he off before he go,btohqsg
But aiya  you know the law  you wanna commit  i wont judge la,btohqsg
"But people will always say one  ""wah buy car cannot afford parking/petrol ah""",btohqsg
especially if your car is some big eurocar like a bimmer or merc,btohqsg
Parking and petrol is half the car loan,btohqsg
before i buy my car  i did calculations and estimate,btohqsg
but now the petrol price up till liddat  got abit tight for me,btohqsg
It's the very reason why i nv buy WRX,btohqsg
cos i know i cannot afford petrol,btohqsg
The fuel piping slanted n gt the one way thing,btohqsg
Go Malaysia pump I need to tell myself I doing this for better petrol,btohqsg
I go malaysia is never about the petrol,btohqsg
I go in go play only,btohqsg

I go in for sushi  steamboat and next burgers,btohqsg
‚ÄúMy car deserves the higher octane!‚Äù,btohqsg
But really the ron100 I feel burns faster,btohqsg
1 bottle can use 2 times leh,btohqsg
I got hear people say it's not very good to use,btohqsg
Spc 98 on my car literally-100km,btohqsg
i've been wanting to try those injection cleaner or engine cleaner addictives,btohqsg
The cleaners should be ok... My workshop service package put all those in,btohqsg
But the octane boosters that one not sure,btohqsg
octane boosters i g ot hear from friend he do before going dyno,btohqsg
The liquid moly system catalytic cleaner also good,btohqsg
i read also  1 time liddat not enough  need a few time,btohqsg
but injection cleaner clean alr how to know it's clean or not?,btohqsg
So he tell me good means should be good la,btohqsg
The system cleaner not the injector one,btohqsg
next service i ask garage R HKS got simi,btohqsg
next time 1 shot buy from them,btohqsg
Need to pipe into the car  then rev constant 3k for Abt 20mins,btohqsg
Pour one bottle of Caltex techron cleaner,btohqsg
Drive up to kluang n back,btohqsg
Last time he do for me  wanted to do in carpark  but after hear the J's exhaust we move to pasir ris park carpark do... Too loud,btohqsg
HKS i got do the engine flush thing before,btohqsg
I think even the hks too loud to do in normal carpark,btohqsg
then they run then drain and change new oil,btohqsg
After doing engine smoother  but it will put stress on your cooling,btohqsg
youtube got a few ppl say before also,btohqsg
Anyone know how to tell if it's time to do valve clearance?,btohqsg
Been thinking of sending mine for a check  but might end up waste time only if not needed,btohqsg
I think when service ask them check lor,btohqsg
Like ask tthem see if it's needed,btohqsg
Cuz his mechanic also worked on my car before,btohqsg

There so easy to kana round up,btohqsg
Just need to park at exit,btohqsg
This and a lot of short distance trips are also part of it,btohqsg
That day I calculated I also surprised,btohqsg
Maybe due to lesser stop for traffic light,btohqsg
I thought wha nice got 9... Then my next pump under 7 again,btohqsg
2 traffic light  one of it maybe faulty,btohqsg
Or is it bar.. don't remember  petrol station it's Abt 220 or 230,btohqsg
actually i hearsay the correct way to do is1. drain old oil2. pour new oil + flush3. idle awhile4. drain new oil5. pour another new oil ini did this with 300V   come out liao my oil on dipstick like transparent,btohqsg
Tsktsk. U got come then we talk abt the car meet. üòí,btohqsg
