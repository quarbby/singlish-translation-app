"💰Pika World Contrarian View on the Stock Market💰Aloha  friends of Pika World. It's back to another episode of our ""alternative view"". In this episode  we will briefly share why the so-called ""seasonality rally"" we hope for may not materialise well in the current macroeconomic and investment landscape.#1: According to seasonality statistics  we will likely see a robust performance riding into the year's end when we have a strong start of double-digit gains in the year's first half#. This is true partly because investors tend to defer their winning into the following year to avoid selling them to incur taxable gain.While we see yet another double-digit growth this year  the situation is less favourable. For one  the current market rally is too narrowly focused on what some would call the ""magnificent 7 or 8""  which contributed mainly to the enormous gain of the S&P 500. Likewise  we have a reservoir of losses for many investors in the bond market  which is a source of the pool to harvest.Given this scenario  we believe the ""delay selling"" effect often delivering a melody of Santa Claus rally could be jeopardised if the self-interest decision-making dynamics wobble in this environment.#2We are sceptical that market participants have agreed on the possibility of higher yields  which could mean multiple contractions for significant indices  pointing to downward pressure on the current valuation.#3And finally  among other headwinds  we are seeing a weakening of the US Treasury market which we have discussed earlier. It could worsen when Auntie Yellen decides to fund the deficit through bond issuance  probably in late October  when we could see a swarm of supply. The ""term premium"" is already vast as demand for Treasury seems weak  and a higher premium is needed to entice private investors to participate in soaking up the supply.We still have considerable holdings  remain favourable for the medium term  and remain committed to investing for the longer haul rather than timing the market; it is  nonetheless  useful to keep these few ""contrarian"" views on our rear mirror.After all  the world is now swimming in a sea of sharks than an oasis of oysters.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃",btohqsg
