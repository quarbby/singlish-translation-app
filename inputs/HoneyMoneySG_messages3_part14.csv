A recession is a macroeconomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It had been typically recognized as two consecutive quarters of economic decline  as reflected by GDP in conjunction with monthly indicators such as a rise in unemployment,btohqsg
First  recession is normal. It is not a matter of if but when,btohqsg
Secondly  it is very hard to time when recession is going to hit. So the common advice is just stay invested and ride it out,btohqsg
On the tapering and interest rate hike  it has been communicated. QE ends by March 2022. We will see 2 to 4 rate hikes this year. How many rate hikes depending on 1) economic activity  2) inflation  3) covid situation,btohqsg
I personally not too worried of a big crash  but definitely should adjust the expectation. It is unlikely to see the crazy rally in the past 1-2 years e.g. shitty stocks also can rocket,btohqsg
Those were caused by extreme amount of liquidity.. now US fed is starting to suck out the liquidity via tapering and gradual interest rate hikes,btohqsg
If that the case there should be a drop it correction,btohqsg
