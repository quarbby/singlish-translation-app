Got quite a few nice anime.,btohqsg
Cos this 2 day I working 48 hr already,btohqsg
should i clear 3 or 4 days of Annual leave next week?,btohqsg
ahhh ya i watched 1-2 episode only,btohqsg
That anime not bad  except is like don‚Äôt know how many girl he gonna have,btohqsg
The last drama I watch is king avatar only,btohqsg
Can see the girl is jealous totally,btohqsg
Yawn. Time for a good spa for weekend,btohqsg
i watched trinity seven and loved it sadly now no more,btohqsg
Not so. Got the yuzu taste is nice üòÇü§£,btohqsg
all the ÈÖíÈ¨º come out liao,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know $1 = rm 3.29 hmm,btohqsg
Go watch finish will be better,btohqsg
Except with 1 ova and 2 movies,btohqsg
In the end both is like hell.,btohqsg
I rewatch like 10 time already,btohqsg
Redo healer is another one gg,btohqsg
Just a bit is considered enjoyment not ÈÖíÈ¨º,btohqsg
Oo I didn‚Äôt know haha. Sad,btohqsg
The lady quite nice  gave me quite alot ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Xmas n cny is all about drinking üòúüòú,btohqsg
Oo. That not helping for research,btohqsg
But the main character damn sad,btohqsg
Not those always dead drunk is different,btohqsg
I went Surrey hills  happy hours 5 to 8pm  paid $12 with main course  free flow white/ red wine üôà,btohqsg
Mr bean queue a lot today,btohqsg
What is going on for Mr bean,btohqsg
this one is wu hua. so its different,btohqsg
Never happened to me before. Idk ah,btohqsg
I'm a social drinker only drink like once a while ü§£,btohqsg
Those day day drink like water then is ÈÖíÈ¨º,btohqsg
so as long as not drink until drunk even if the quantity drank is a lot considered not ÈÖíÈ¨º?,btohqsg
i see where the interpretation differs now,btohqsg
so if suck kkj but don‚Äôt enjoy it is not gay even if continue to suck  but the moment you enjoy it means you are gay,btohqsg
Very hard to describe. Basically drink till like water daily  hourly  every single moment bah,btohqsg
yeah my pinyin pretty good de,btohqsg
If sucks to earn money bobian not enjoying probably is not gay,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA wew now need to bring financial incentive in,btohqsg
thats not how it work is it?,btohqsg
but the concept is there mah,btohqsg
Oo today is tang yuan festival??,btohqsg
if someone tells you  i‚Äôm a vegetarian i never try meat before but i know meat is disgusting,btohqsg
too busy flirting and seducing him,btohqsg
vs someone who used to eat meat say they turned vegetarian because meat is disgusting,btohqsg
if you had to choose one,btohqsg
Kill me please  I would rather run out of my office and go home first,btohqsg
No way  I don‚Äôt later her gf come after me,btohqsg
She older then you like 8 year lolz,btohqsg
okay if someone tried skydiving before  said it‚Äôs scary but fun  and someone said they never tried it but it‚Äôs dangerous and not fun  who you believe more?,btohqsg
Well I like older women üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind intro  good luck if you stealing her.,btohqsg
Still is myself.. I believe is dangerous cause insurance don't cover n they asked u sign agreement before u can dive ü§£,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not tilted about that i‚Äôm tilted cuz i cannot make my joke,btohqsg
Just make sure your pocket is very big enough?,btohqsg
we take calculated risks when we decided to do most things,btohqsg
the point i wanted to make is,btohqsg
Y is this the first msg I see üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
you arrow down to the right post üòÇ,btohqsg
@Arecanecrafternever tried having gary inside him before so we cannot trust that he isn‚Äôt gay until he tried it with gary and knows that he doesn‚Äôt like it,btohqsg
Though you want older woman haha,btohqsg
NO LA WALAO will nv happen,btohqsg
u heng here not 'simi' 'simi' will tell you to open the window and look out. üòÇ,btohqsg
We won't know for sure. Maybe it did happen,btohqsg
ya i alr tell fam liao,btohqsg
Have u tried? How do you know if you haven't? üòèüòè,btohqsg
Cause u went his house n found out,btohqsg
For some older woman  need to prepare big pocket or big responsibility,btohqsg
only you will know unless you want to share your experience?,btohqsg
"ok i rephrase ""i prefer older women""",btohqsg
how do you know when you haven try gary?,btohqsg
Also prefer older woman can be single mum ?? Is that counted ??,btohqsg
Cause u don't enjoy Gary so u preferred to try djj?,btohqsg
Do you not like younger girls?,btohqsg
yes what can i do for you sir,btohqsg
uhhhhh idm la but parents cfm make noise,btohqsg
who don‚Äôt like 2 for the price of 1 sale,btohqsg
only older women can be single mum?!,btohqsg
see my latest analogy just above,btohqsg
High chance he interest in it haha,btohqsg
but need wait i financially stable 1st XD,btohqsg
that's remarkably a very accurate description of that npo you're describing,btohqsg
ITS 90% OF THE PPL THERE,btohqsg
Meaning regardless is young or old  sure got few is single mum too,btohqsg
I can not read this group msg when I'm outside  later people will think I siao liao..,btohqsg
yes that's why i said not all,btohqsg
looking of course like la  but i wont date,btohqsg
but their behavior would definitely come off as obnoxious,btohqsg
so what has that got to do with him preferring older women?,btohqsg
you can try to up a level and see the chat dissipate,btohqsg
how you know when you haven dated a younger girl?,btohqsg
Except will have more big hole in the pocket,btohqsg
Sorry  rephrase it. Is not just big hole for the pocket  whether the person will accept the child or not first,btohqsg
i mean trueee but i really cant vibe well with ppl younger than me,btohqsg
dont anyhow bring name in leh,btohqsg
i can't help that it isn't music to the ears of most if that's the truth ma,btohqsg
It's the kind of djj u wanted,btohqsg
coz thats the point of a question,btohqsg
when you do a comparison you are pointed to pick the lesser of two evils,btohqsg
or the answer that fits closer to the truth,btohqsg
they still won't know who. we also duno who,btohqsg
even i also still dont know who üòÇ,btohqsg
But if he wants Gary n djj together  it's fine also unless Gary don't accept,btohqsg
if intelligence is the ability to adapt  doesn‚Äôt it then show that the inflexibility of the supposed intellectually elite is but a farce  if they are unable to maintain a normal conversation with people whom they deem their ‚Äúlessers‚Äù,btohqsg
you see we really have to thank technology,btohqsg
How can it be ? Don‚Äôt you have normal girl friend that is younger then you yet ?,btohqsg
so i put to you that said elites are not truly intellectually elite,btohqsg
gary will win cuz he got better income,btohqsg
kiosk are designed to tackle people like you  so you're forced to make a choice or get out of the line,btohqsg
imagine you in a mcdonald's queue,btohqsg
Sakli djj got landed...Gary will cry,btohqsg
i wave good bye to Gary,btohqsg

Mcd if I can't decide  I order both n took a bite each then give uncle. It always happens anyways,btohqsg
but then that depends on the measurement of intelligenceto you it might be the ability to adapt  but to the InTellEctually ElITe it might be something else,btohqsg
Just let it flow and slowly social with the young one in future.,btohqsg
So now it's Gary cause no djj with landed lah,btohqsg
but we both damn boomer type,btohqsg
and 1yr younger nia not vry young also,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a freaking quote from stephen hawking,btohqsg
but then again if you're unable to hold a conversation with your lessers not out of contempt but rather due to the lack of ability to actually communicate,btohqsg
i think that spells a lot,btohqsg
unless they think they are more intelligent than stephen fucking hawking,btohqsg
Take it slowly. For me I need to keep track on the current generation also.,btohqsg
i honestly think it‚Äôs both for said people.,btohqsg
I cant even keep up with my sis,btohqsg
why keep up when you'll never be part of it,btohqsg
Ok I rephrase. So now it's Gary cause no djj,btohqsg
like you don't expect your parents to keep up with your era,btohqsg
then they obviously aren‚Äôt even intelligent enough to even comprehend how little they know,btohqsg
now got no 1 at all,btohqsg
where's that gif that says please stop and fiddles with his nipples,btohqsg
my folks for all their faults are all brighter than the majority of the population bah,btohqsg
i need that gif right now,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt have that gif HAHAHA,btohqsg
True I may not part of it  but at least will understand in some point for what they might think or what they wish for their own path.,btohqsg
no landed got bto also good,btohqsg
i don't mean it in an offensive way,btohqsg
but i feel that it's unnecessary thats all,btohqsg
No worry  each of us got our own point of view and how we think?,btohqsg
you adopt a day of the current gen's lingo and practices  the lack of depth would drive you insane,btohqsg
Think for me still ok  I never change my own prospective. Except the young generation thinking for work is a little different.,btohqsg
i mean the effort itself is already commendable so..,btohqsg
is it you have problems clicking the links in that post?,btohqsg
Some of my generation that I know is will keep up to certain generation for the younger first if say gonna work with us as colleague or other  so first we also must go check and see how the young generation is thinking and other too,btohqsg
Technology and other will keep changing and improving at the same from time to time.,btohqsg
why need to keep up to the younger folks. they can try to catch up instead,btohqsg
Uhhh idk la our age so far apart,btohqsg
How I wish I got shares for it ü§£ too poor,btohqsg
Ahahaha everyone here in my company all watch tiktok then some still the songs üòÇ,btohqsg
ok you can embrace the current gen the moment you understandthis type of humor :,btohqsg
1 generation is how Many year actually ?,btohqsg
Mean can count 1 generation gap ?,btohqsg
Mean your sister is older then you by 12 year ?,btohqsg
"I still don't understand what ""slay"" meansüòÇ",btohqsg
Oo so is around 7 yr old ?,btohqsg
I wish I got older sis lor,btohqsg
most of the words that the current gen use are cringe,btohqsg
Got sibling better then been the only child,btohqsg
Wait  you are 19 or ?,btohqsg
example:person A flexes the amount of STD contracted on instagramperson B sees the post  and replies : A you slayyyyy,btohqsg
True. The way it type is different,btohqsg
it basically means you're killing it,btohqsg
it's cringe when you have to explain what it means,btohqsg
i dont really like the word at all lol,btohqsg
Maybe you can think back about the past you experience it. Probably will need to change to your sister generation for understanding,btohqsg
thats why i boomer i see those words i liek ewww,btohqsg
or the common singaporean term of AIYOOOOOOOOOO,btohqsg
as i said the terms if you have to explain them,btohqsg
your secretary knows how to count?,btohqsg
I still listen to cd player sometime,btohqsg
I try to avoid using them,btohqsg
i trying to not make fun of how he messed up the math,btohqsg
because the moment you get attached to these terms  your lack of vocabulary would be amplified intensively,btohqsg
Sorry for no offence  I quit school when I didn‚Äôt finish my N lvl,btohqsg
just imagine a 25 year old man saying the word sheesh or slay,btohqsg
So can say all my subject is a ‚Äú F ‚Äú,btohqsg
