It’s a tough decision to make to re enter at price you just cut. Not many can advise you on this.What was your EP for the losing trade,btohqsg
When I saw ur msg I thought its morning greetings....thought market gonna start in an hour 😂,btohqsg
Had a Long day at work yesterday . Didn’t look at the market and made any trades.Later should be a good day for trading hopefully.Lets see the opening how the market move to get a feel of what’s to come,btohqsg
$1.9   planned exit of $1.98/1.99 😪,btohqsg
So tomorrow all eyes on VP and MT? haha...,btohqsg
I'm thinking of re-enter...have been monitoring for awhile..,btohqsg
Dyodd don’t do something you will regret and believe yourself,btohqsg
😨 Wah  never considered to stopped earlier ? Could have minimised a lot of damage. That’s why I always emphasise the importance of SL.I’ve known many who have lost 6 digits on a counter. They are able to consistently make overall from trading  as they have learnt and become really  disciplined and most important  they  understand the need for having stop loss when they made the trade.To the new players here  hope you guys take heed and learn on the importance on stop loss. Many YouTube videos out there but it will definitely help. Discipline is key in trading.Lose some is okay  you can rethink what went wrong and come back again.  If lose too big  some might never get back to trading again.It’s the truth  hard truth but good reminder that trading’s not as easy as some might think.,btohqsg
Traded stocks in Singapore and most recovered within weeks or months.,btohqsg
Good advise bro. Most of the time pple hang on to hope and was dilemma whether to cut loss or hope that it will rise again only to fall further. Must heed ur advise and be discipline enough to cut loss earlier,btohqsg
VP today below 30 ..y never eye on it ? Now up more than 40 percent .. tomorow then eye on it ?,btohqsg
Depend on the entry price.. due to their arrow medical and forfront medical .. everyone is betting on that,btohqsg
Yea that’s why. Human nature is such  must happen to the person him/herself then they will realised. Same for me and many others who have played Long enough.,btohqsg
Whether you own or planning to enter UG  wait till share split to see how it goes.,btohqsg
Wise words. I am guilty of hoping and no SL 😞,btohqsg
Agreed want a call broker he will ask why buy this stocks????,btohqsg
Waiting for TG to chiong soon. 😁,btohqsg
0.085 ringgit is $0.028 ... Typo ?,btohqsg
Yah typo. When is the payout?,btohqsg
Lets see if got accumulation prior to x date,btohqsg
Not many here will be interested in TG.... 10% upside potential?It is penny no more.,btohqsg
2.60 stock give less than 3 cent sgd. even lazy go count yieldOn a good day likely a free dividend on ex,btohqsg
Never a penny for a long while,btohqsg
Total dividends paid for whole year less than the share buy back for past few days . Share buy back or give dividends better?,btohqsg
So long ago liao haven’t reply,btohqsg
Both also good share buyback good for short term holders dividends good for long term holders,btohqsg
He only wants made in America masks,btohqsg
We all are at some point of time.Also  the fear that we stop out and then what if it rally back up etc.But overall  it’s about getting that discipline in place.It’s really dangerous if have no stops unless you are confident and have already decided to hold it forever when you buy the stockUltimately  doing that will also result in plenty of opportunities costs. So  we really have to weigh the pros and cons of doing so.,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD  :“The key to making money is not to get scared out of them”- Peter LynchHave a great day ahead. Safe Trading everyone and today feels like a bullish day!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place.

"actually... any stock brokerage got stop loss (trailing profit) function or not?vickers limit order cannot be considered as ""stop loss"" right",btohqsg
If every counter you play triggered SL means your dyodd something wrong lol,btohqsg

Don't play speculative stocks go do the hard work find out about the company financial prospect and stuff,btohqsg
