U always have alot here alot there .. what's makes me think is that typical mentality of your who can just think drawing and monthly pay is good enough. Hope u don't take this to ur deathbed.. go venture your potentials just don't be a servant for someone .. yes stability counts but it won't do your character a favour.. u will realize this in the long run .. cheers .. from ur replies I know u are still young .. therefore it's a marathon my friend,btohqsg
See. U always assume.  Stop assuming . You don't know my age.  When you said fail fitness out. And I reply I have friends inside who also fail their fitness but still inside the force you can't answer that. Like I say I not here to argue with you. U have ur thinking I have my thinking. Idk whatever I have said affected you so much. Oh well,btohqsg
Bro .. simple let me tell u a Singaporean way.. stop talking cock and go and sleep.. this chat is for lalamove.. not a chat for ur friends in FP or SPF. I don't know your age yes.. but ur replies tell me that u are a young punk .. maybe u are older but that simply means your mind is still like a child.. so .. drink your Milo and take ur bolster and go to sleep..,btohqsg
Show me that ur earning more than me with all your stability shit stuff and I will apologize for my rudeness in this same chat,btohqsg
Loser always have another thing to say back. From the first massage that I send is not referring to u. U chose to reply.,btohqsg
What for? For u to compare? Have nth to say just keep ur comment away. Assuming and too sensitive.,btohqsg
Yes assuming and too sensitive... That's me ... How about u,btohqsg
Don't need u to know. Stop assuming and sensitive.,btohqsg
U have no fucking goals or shit.. but in this chat got 20k people who are mostly doing well .. so don't come and pass on ur negativity towards them.. have a good night,btohqsg
Is that the 2 English words u know ?,btohqsg
Was talking to someone and u reply me. Well I don't need u to reply me at first. But u did .,btohqsg
If u think am sensitive yes I am .. told u this before.. someone talks bad about ur family u will also reply .. I did the same   this is lalamove chat u talk bad about it I will reply,btohqsg
