Sorry la work 14 hours le brain not working well,btohqsg

Hahaha I feel the same. I had my interview on 22/4 and no news. A lot of ppl around me received their offers alr,btohqsg
Hahaha sorry for the late bump. I came to check if NTU sent y‚Äôall rejection emails,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just waiting to get rejected already haha even though nothing appeared in my mailbox,btohqsg
Interviews are for borderline cases is it,btohqsg
Yea I applied via ABA haha cos my rp is shit,btohqsg
Thanks! I just drafted my appeal letter haha,btohqsg
How is it hidden if it is universal,btohqsg
It defines this universe but perhaps not the next,btohqsg
I didnt say CS is ML arh,btohqsg
I just said ML and AI is one of the specialisation in CS,btohqsg
Ml algo is plain math plus guess and check,btohqsg
Ur back prop can do without knowledge of calculus is it,btohqsg
from sklearn import neighbors  tree  ensemble  naive_bayes  svmimport tensorflow as tf,btohqsg
Use library also considered algo wow,btohqsg
I dunno what point u want contest but me got better stuff to attend to,btohqsg
Does not need to actually know,btohqsg
or what the computer is doing,btohqsg
anything from 20% of the time to 98% of the time,btohqsg
CS and ML are miles apart so I don't see how you can specialise in ML from CS.,btohqsg
Ultimately ML is still a subfield of computer science and stats,btohqsg
But I needa go sleep lol tmr need book in,btohqsg
Shit i also need write my appeal reason,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt u get ur chosen course,btohqsg
Honestly idh much  so I bombed NS stuff,btohqsg
And then u lose interest for the new course,btohqsg
U can sustain 4 years in uni anot,btohqsg
At least it wont be because of phycis,btohqsg
The main concern i have for the course i initially went is that the amount of hardwork that is required wont translate to decent income coz its still a not so well established industry in singapore,btohqsg
Unless you did some real interesting shit I honestly doubt NS that relevant,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said I bombed...,btohqsg
Local companies need at least 2 years worth of experience. And it doesnt look like its gonna improve despite covid shit,btohqsg
using the power of vocabulary to twist my NS life into life lessons and shit,btohqsg
Mostly the algo-side ba.The other CS-ey things can get very theoretical and sometimes of no direct use today yet,btohqsg
Sorry pal aku not so strong. Admin role only :0),btohqsg
Once a gunner always a gunner,btohqsg
AKA the vocation of BG NS/RET Lee,btohqsg
IDK if he NS or RET,btohqsg

he left service as a BG to become politician,btohqsg
we are gunners we are men of steel,btohqsg
Healthtech is the next new shit,btohqsg
able to take pain with relentless will,btohqsg
why u never hormat gunners song,btohqsg
U also someone's son and next time u someone's father,btohqsg
No need take pride in everything de,btohqsg
Yeah but u see most of the BIE BME grads are jobless lol,btohqsg
people say once a gunner always a gunner but u no gun only shoot watergun,btohqsg
But companies require 2 yrs of experience in field. How to het that kind of exp in internship,btohqsg
Huh so high barrier one meh,btohqsg
Then everyone no job le sia,btohqsg
Yah i asked a bunch of grads,btohqsg
Thats why most take research route or take up other kind of jobs,btohqsg
Honestly most shit in uni ain't used in industry,btohqsg
Just take whichever degree you can score in,btohqsg
Then job wise do something else,btohqsg
I scared i may end up doing that,btohqsg
Best prep for job is not degree is internship,btohqsg
Go stack 4-5 confirm can find ft job,btohqsg
In CV ur school takes up literally one line,btohqsg
Then ur other shit takes up 80-90pct,btohqsg
does doing every single paper in tys help for chinese,btohqsg
does revising textbook verbs do much?,btohqsg
Tbh for Chinese o level  ive never written out the answer before  esp for revision,btohqsg
Just look at passage  highlight the answer or bracket it,btohqsg
It will help u get used to the format  such as how to copy answer from passage properly,btohqsg
No point copying the same thing,btohqsg
So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good idea,btohqsg
oh i j do the mcqs,btohqsg
Plus there‚Äôs only so many words in the language,btohqsg
yea cos i forgot the ËØæÊú¨ existed for 3 months ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
but will doing lets say 10 papers have about the same effect as doing all 20 papers?,btohqsg
U must score fulk mark in all the MCQ,btohqsg
And u must score the mark form finding the few words of same meaning,btohqsg
i try la my chinese cmi HAHA,btohqsg
Than the rest it's more or less copt,btohqsg
oh i do that all the time,btohqsg
if i legit dk cfm 0 marks,btohqsg
Is the easiest place to score,btohqsg
yea unless ur chinese like zai liddat,btohqsg
U shade 3 letter  u get more mark than writing 4lines,btohqsg
but i j got 10 for one tdy,btohqsg
Try to see which one suits more and sounds more right,btohqsg
Language is get better by usage,btohqsg
but im v unlucky so HAHA,btohqsg
I really don't think doing TYS helps,btohqsg
I completed the entire TYS 10 year in a day,btohqsg
Cos all I do is just circle option,btohqsg
im kinda glad olevel got shifted later,btohqsg
cos if its 1june idh time,btohqsg
There's no point to writing the paragraph out,btohqsg
I can go front back a few time,btohqsg
Now that I look back on my school days,btohqsg
thats why i dont do the zuowen and email in tys,btohqsg
i js read model compos oops,btohqsg
I always copy down the answer from the teacher when they go through the comprehensions,btohqsg
But when I think about it,btohqsg
I don't even know what I'm writing,btohqsg
For science also  chem o level   no point writing the entire answer out. Just write in point form,btohqsg
Nor did I afterwards try to understand,btohqsg
ËÆÆËÆ∫Êñá becoming more and more of a chore for me,btohqsg
Listneing compre must full mark also,btohqsg
So legit in class understand first,btohqsg
No point memorising all the special words,btohqsg
Just use simple words can le,btohqsg
My Chinese teacher force me memroise a opening paragraph,btohqsg
Than I use for my P6  sec 1 all the way to sec 4  and even JC1,btohqsg
I mean its science not english so the teachers shouldnt care abt ur sentence structures,btohqsg
If theres grammar errors its fine,btohqsg
I have friends who write in sentence form,btohqsg
And waste Alot of timr writing,btohqsg
When they do one paper  I can finish like E,btohqsg
Because I just give point form,btohqsg
Or in o's you can js write in bullet points,btohqsg
No point writing everything out cos the qn is going to test the same thing over and over again,btohqsg
But in exams need to write sentences la,btohqsg
I heard bio mcqs always repeat,btohqsg
It's studying hard vs studying smart,btohqsg
But the interesting topic got removed from o's,btohqsg
I dont take bio so doesnt affect me but like,btohqsg
Man and it's environment ah üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
its v heavy tho so ig its good that its taken out,btohqsg
It's literally how u can save the earth,btohqsg
idk i cant absorb bio content but for that somehow i could,btohqsg
it was the first topic i learnt im sec sch LOL,btohqsg
ngl its better than chem's air topic,btohqsg
i heard combined science also has it,btohqsg
Scientific communication is every bit as important as scientific knowledge,btohqsg

The subject is what keeps you going in your darkest days,btohqsg
CBC is still open for him,btohqsg

Titration is the best part of chem no lie,btohqsg
Maths is not a spectator sport,btohqsg
He reads Shakespeare as part of his h1 Lit,btohqsg
what do mathematician do  just curious,btohqsg
as in if u pHd in math,btohqsg
They take a crack at unsolved problems,btohqsg
And then they write papers about their progress,btohqsg
they spend entire lives doing it until they die. Rotting.,btohqsg
