Quite a lot restaurants also starting the campaign of “reserved” meals,btohqsg
Like you can pay for additional meal,btohqsg
So the restaurant can give the meal to the needed,btohqsg
Sad part is there is a lot of sick or poor ppl who can’t travel to pickup these food also and govt implement travel restriction. So only way is to hang white flag  hoping kind neighbors can help,btohqsg

For Malaysia  I think lockdown is not the answer. They really need to start vaccinating the serious state first.,btohqsg
Their city area population very jia lat one.. Similarly Manila also..Their gahment wanna impose strict lockdown also cham..But so much effort after 1yr+ liao.. Hindsight.. If initially hoot one time gao gao lockdown probably won’t be so cham..All in all we’re very fortunate be in this red dot.. Gahment really efficient.. Of course past reserves play major part.. Feels nice to be rich I think.. HAHAHA,btohqsg
