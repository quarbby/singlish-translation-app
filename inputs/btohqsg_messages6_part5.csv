that‚Äôs strange... it shouldn‚Äôt be 73 years lease left. it was built in the early or mid-1980s if I‚Äôm not wrong  with the rubbish chute inside the house,btohqsg
you mean those flats TOP in the 90s were the first batch not to include the rubbish chute within the house?,btohqsg
yeah  1995 houses (73 years lease left) and beyond do not have rubbish chutes in the units. an example would be the Woodlands Drive 72 flats,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the weird thing... it shouldn‚Äôt be because the flats in that area were built before 1990. oh well,btohqsg
I don't think this one is built in the 90s,btohqsg
1985 maybe they typo one digit,btohqsg

Theres a linkbridge at 10 storey . Its to the carpark right ? But the carpark only 9th storey leh üòü so still need go down stairs/lift to access carpark ?,btohqsg
It's possible for 9th floor of carpark to be 10th floor of another block due to different elevation or ceiling height etc. Best to look at 3d model to find out,btohqsg
Ohh i see !! Didnt know üòÖ any idea where can i see the 3d model at?,btohqsg
Which project is this? May BTO?,btohqsg
It applies to other projects as well. There is a project where the carpark roof garden is level 7  but it links to lvl 8 of the adjacent block. from the block to the roof garden  there is a downward sloping ramp too  so it's not a surprise.,btohqsg
Ohh i see .. didnt know about this üòÖ thank you üòÖ,btohqsg
Fun story. I have a friend who stays on lvl 5  his friends visited him. He asked them to park on lvl 5and walked over. They ended up on 6.Lolol,btohqsg
Sorry I can't find the 3d model for this project online,btohqsg
But unlikely to have stairs. Probably will have a ramp if really on different levels,btohqsg
Its okay thank you so much üôè,btohqsg
Yup saw this too but didnt show about the carpark thing. Anyways its okay .,btohqsg
