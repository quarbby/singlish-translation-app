After selection of unit (first appointment) how long hdb will get back to you for the second appointment? After I selected a unit last December until now no news from hdb.,btohqsg
Anyone heard or know  will HDB release keys to owner for the completed block or HDB will wait for the whole project to complete then release the keys.,btohqsg
Soon. U may want to call them and check. U need to pay the 10%,btohqsg
Tried calling  either too busy to answer or they will direct me to the sales line which will disengage After a few rings.,btohqsg
Log in to your my hdb portal. And check or email them. They are quite fast. Should be soon. When come to  Payment  $ they are very fast .,btohqsg
Me too waiting for 2nd appointment . They said 4-9 months ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Btw 2nd appointment need make payment for 5-10% rite via cpf ?,btohqsg
the longer the better  no need worry since you have already booked the unit,btohqsg
accrued interest starts to compute the moment you signed for your LOA,btohqsg
yes but 5% if any of you is below 30yo,btohqsg
So after the 2nd appoint the they will inform us when when is the final pcd?,btohqsg
hard to inform you one because there are uncertainty,btohqsg
just count as 3 years after 2nd appointment,btohqsg
maybe 4 years after 2nd appointment,btohqsg
those who are waiting to be called up for 2nd appointment  you want to pay accrued interest so early ah?,btohqsg
I paid 3 years ago  still waiting for TOP and my AI accumulated $1500 already,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt applied in mature estates coz they know cannot get one but even applied in non mature still unsuccessful,btohqsg
yes I reckon kovan will be oversubscribed 99,btohqsg
if my mum didn't get her unit this SBF  she's going to ballot for May macpherson and kovan in Aug too,btohqsg
few steps to MRT/hawker/heartland mall  walk further down to shophouses/Cross opposite to row of cafes  cross the other side to row of eateries,btohqsg
if you're going to lor ah soo in a rainy day  don't have to bring umbrella  all sheltered as there are buses looping,btohqsg
In fact august alot good plots,btohqsg
kovan is the best location for non mature estate,btohqsg
better than bidadari in terms of amenities,btohqsg
my guess for the starting price of 4r is 350k,btohqsg
My guess is 380k cause near mrt also,btohqsg
But no one knows till launch,btohqsg
Woodlands Central starts from $306 000 on 2nd floor,btohqsg
the price of BTO depends on the surrounding transactions of resale too,btohqsg
Yup and woodlands has the lowest median always,btohqsg
Mine 337 800 + 10 000 (wife PR) on a 6th levelüòö,btohqsg
So kovan cfm much more $,btohqsg
306k might be the resale pricing of 3r,btohqsg

7 units on each level except roof garden,btohqsg
5 x 5 rooms and 2 x 4 rooms‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Sorry for sending so many pictures,btohqsg
too bad my good friend had no chance to get his 3r at woodlands,btohqsg
Limited only around 144 x 3 rooms,btohqsg
his wife is Malaysian PR  sure make life much easier if they were to be balloted,btohqsg
All units at Woodlands all being selected,btohqsg
those who have failed to get BTO/SBF  maybe you have chance getting the greater Southern waterfront flats,btohqsg
Best is to buy flats that are located next to MRT  that normally means it is next to shopping malls though not all,btohqsg
