Even different RON can mix  just that your Ron becomes an average level of what you've put in and how much you had,btohqsg
A lot of people who require high octane fuels in the States have to do this because they cannot find the desired octane everywhere,btohqsg

Any thoughts on Volvo xc40 ev for a first time car owner? AD selling at 244k,btohqsg
If you paying this much  get the Model Y. Model Y is bigger and sells for 245k. Both same segment but mOdel Y is more spacious. Has access to Superchargers.,btohqsg
I prefer volvo cus solid chassis,btohqsg
Wife is primary driver. Likes the safety for the kids. Shall look at model Y but more my kinda ride 😆,btohqsg
Ya model Y is more “value for money”,btohqsg
Becoz the road tax is about 2.2k also.,btohqsg
why must go for EV leh,btohqsg
Tesla safer lol. Becoz 林志颖 survived a fire from that crash in Taiwan.Another Tesla survived a 50m cliff crash when the driver purposely drove it down a cliff to kill hmself + family. End up all survived. Just happened in the US not long ago,btohqsg
Less fun but running cost cheaper as new charger at our place,btohqsg
Granted yes you don’t get the nice stuff like FSD here  you can don’t buy the software update here in Singapore first until it’s mature.,btohqsg
Ya then I recommend you get the Model Y.,btohqsg
Having access to supercharger very big difference in charging routine,btohqsg
