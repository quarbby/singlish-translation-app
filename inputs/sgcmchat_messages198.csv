see how if i even come,btohqsg
im only there to fuck around,btohqsg
can i do a one wheel peel?,btohqsg
i kick you out afterwards ah,btohqsg
*fart sound pop pop pop* *one wheel peel*organisers: is veli hard to control crowds!!! omg cs3!!!,btohqsg
if your car even has the power,btohqsg
*proceeds to talk shit behinds someone’s back*,btohqsg
i'd love to see you try ngl,btohqsg
i will do it in a safe and controlled environment,btohqsg
i changing tyre soon anyways so why not right,btohqsg
or do a one tyre fire on both sides until your tyres become slicks,btohqsg
eh but can fit your car anot,btohqsg
I drove on 2x Tristar and 2x Arivo tyre and skidded before on metal,btohqsg
But the issue was heavy rain  slight ponding but I was flying,btohqsg
So that was skill issue on my part,btohqsg
Throwback  I rented it cuz it’s green colour,btohqsg
But I always wanted to drive a green coloured car,btohqsg
Now I wanna drive a bronze coloured car,btohqsg
how bronze do you want it,btohqsg
Also I want to drive a pink coloured car,btohqsg
Like the one u langgar side mirror,btohqsg
also last i drove it the thread mostly gonez alr,btohqsg
I alr drove 2/3 in their fleet,btohqsg
eh the blue not bad leh,btohqsg
did the 2 of them have battery warnings,btohqsg
Nope  I think it’s ur skill issue acting up,btohqsg
eh im not saying mine did,btohqsg
eh but say real not bad,btohqsg
It’s a good car  whack also 20km/l,btohqsg
You should genuinely try attrage tho  it’s not as bad as u think  except when you’re trying to overtake,btohqsg
but i can get maz2 hatch for same price,btohqsg
might as well i take the mazda,btohqsg
Maz3 much nicer to drive tho  I rather spend a bit more,btohqsg
i think if it's genuinely on a budget i bochup bah.,btohqsg
but if i could choose either mazda 3 or gp5,btohqsg
Try a kimchi car soon too,btohqsg
Tried  but start from the previous gen first,btohqsg
Cuz when u drive cn7  you’ll notice the differences if u tried the predecessors,btohqsg
Also fun fact: plug in ur phone on kimchi cars to USB jack. CarPlay will load up. Idk about android auto but should have also,btohqsg
wouldn't mind renting it for the weekend honestly,btohqsg
eh i thought it was standard on CN7,btohqsg
waiting for ioniq 5n to land locally leh,btohqsg
pls invite if u get the show car thanks,btohqsg
road tax abit crazy but ignoring that  the price is 🍇,btohqsg
i don't have that many connections within Hyundai,btohqsg
who never pass TP and IF?,btohqsg
if got press car even for a few hours shiok alr,btohqsg
Even some Kia K3 also have,btohqsg
or rental co throw on one,btohqsg
yeah that's what i rmb from cn7,btohqsg
This is CN7 hybrid press car,btohqsg
the PFL had wireless too right?,btohqsg
Iirc yes  a bit forgot liao,btohqsg
eh but genuinely a decent buy for PARF car,btohqsg
better options in there than some contis,btohqsg
not the best but can close one eye la,btohqsg
venti seats and wireless cp more than enough,btohqsg
tbf a class all around 11km ish,btohqsg
was it? thought it was standard on the high trims,btohqsg
And it’s a 250k km unit,btohqsg
I don’t think so  might have remembered wrongly,btohqsg
hybrid doesnt have electric pass seat,btohqsg
but venti seats for both front,btohqsg
was talking to william leh  he said his didnt have i think? need check again,btohqsg
Got electric seat adjustments + welcome seats. It’s a setting,btohqsg
fuck backside itchy to try cn7 now,btohqsg
Try a GM car too and you’ll feel that it’s quite junk,btohqsg
Other than 4wd and it’s engine note  quite bland,btohqsg
I’m more of a NPC car tryer,btohqsg
Also be careful of bumpers falling out itself during rentals,btohqsg
so what was the solution from rental co side,btohqsg
Diesel ok  but petrol gearbox quite lag,btohqsg
its sad they got taxed to fk by LTA,btohqsg
and everyone just has massive stigma after VWgate,btohqsg
i daily a diesel and its very fun watching 99% of regular ass traffic disappear in my mirror when we go uphill,btohqsg
bro i can’t even open the video,btohqsg
its a vid of a stupid 1.6 civic sending it in ite,btohqsg
i nvr thought i would cringe this early in the morning,btohqsg

Fun fact!The Proton is actually a Japanese brand that was sold in the Japanese Domestic Market. A fan favourite among farmers & regular day to day workers  it was chosen as it was very reliable and could hold it’s own weightProton’s were best known for being cheap  handled greatly & a symbol of Japanese pride 🇯🇵Proton was soon sent over to Malaysia to cater to the Malaysian’s pride of letting the Japanese invade into Singapore in 8th February 1942  and for the love of Japanese Engineering.Although not known well  Proton was also responsible for the manufacturing  research & design for Lotus  and a joint project collaboration with Honda for the NSX NA1The more you know!,btohqsg
