I think is not bb run.. is insider run.. maybe bb also kanna play,btohqsg
I wonder why they didn't announce if they received the 30% of the 100mil deal yet,btohqsg
Maybe tomorrow AGM will provide some answers,btohqsg
Don't think they are required to do so for every payment in a deal.,btohqsg
Either way I'm gonna short at open.. high chance will have some quick play down,btohqsg
Given the nature of Aspen.. they any small news also announce,btohqsg
may already gap down no meat,btohqsg
So I'm surprised they would announce 30% deposit,btohqsg
If open 22 can short to 20.. anything below may not be worth,btohqsg
I wouldn't risk shorting as the price has sell down prior to this retract announcement. However  I suspect this news will allow them to recover their shorts.,btohqsg
Isn't short need to recover same day?,btohqsg
The breakdown by age looks like this:Baby Boomers:‚ÄØBaby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. They're currently between 57-75 years old (71.6 million in the U.S.)Gen X:‚ÄØGen X was born between 1965 and 1979/80 and is currently between 41-56 years old (65.2 million people in the U.S.)Gen Y:‚ÄØGen Y  or Millennials  were born between 1981 and 1994/6. They are currently between 25 and 40 years old (72.1 million in the U.S.)Gen Y.1 = 25-29 years old (around 31 million people in the U.S.)Gen Y.2 = 29-39 (around 42 million people in the U.S.)Gen Z:‚ÄØGen Z is the newest generation  born between 1997 and 2012/15. They are currently between 6 and 24 years old (nearly 68 million in the U.S.)The term ‚ÄúMillennial‚Äù has become the popular way to reference both segments of Gen Y (more on Y.1 and Y.2 below).And as for ‚ÄúZillennials ‚Äù‚ÄØthose wedged at the tail end of Millennials and the start of Gen Z are sometimes labeled with this moniker ‚Äî a group made up of people born between 1994 and the year 2000.Realistically  the name‚ÄØGeneration Z‚ÄØis a placeholder for the youngest people on the planet. It‚Äôs likely to morph as they leave adolescence and mature into their adult identities.,btohqsg
I think aspen dont have cfd short option,btohqsg
"Hard to play for Aspen  if naked short scare company later halt and announce ""good news"".",btohqsg
High chance next announcement is 200mil deal call off.. else no reason to take back announcement if the other party was still interested,btohqsg
Thanks for the detailed explanation though,btohqsg
True.. now a days bad news makes stock rocket and good news sell down wahah,btohqsg
Yes  BBs always like to do the opposite. That's how they earn from retailers.,btohqsg
I wonder what@MysticDaxhas to say about Aspen,btohqsg
Yes... News is just an excuse for institutions to play,btohqsg
haha i avoid that forum totally,btohqsg
