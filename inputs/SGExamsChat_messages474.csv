eh cb how u travel everyday siao ah,btohqsg
My cousin from NP....he messaged me and ask me why i in np's chat lmao,btohqsg
we live near the same mrt my friend,btohqsg
WHEN Y GOES TO SCH ME N RYAN LEAVE HOME AND WE ALL 3 BOARD THE TRAIN OHHH THATS RIGHT ü§ôü§ôü§ô,btohqsg
later i bang you into drain,btohqsg
pocoyo and i have been trying to meet for months alr despite living so close to each other,btohqsg
my brain cant process what you just said,btohqsg
snorlax and i have been trying to meet,btohqsg
I live closer to Ryan fight me rn,btohqsg
other thsn u swimming to find out mixue is closed,btohqsg
NO NO MY MALA VIRGINITY NOT STOLEN YET,btohqsg
OK I ASK HIM FOR THE MONEY OK GOD,btohqsg
it was by an instant packet,btohqsg
OH YEA YALL want to try that right,btohqsg
rmb yall plan to eat the paya lebar mala,btohqsg
Im sorry as yk I lose my experiences to the lousiest things or people,btohqsg
see same line we all so swag,btohqsg
its like the little brother of tampinies,btohqsg
ive been to your sheng siong,btohqsg
you‚Äôre the little brother of ur brother john,btohqsg
who want accompany me take green line to pioneer,btohqsg
the furthest ive been on the green line is lakeside,btohqsg
This sls is legit brain numbing as hell,btohqsg
actually maybe i‚Äôll be staying in hall next sem,btohqsg
Like it's just rev of trigo,btohqsg
I help u singWANSUEEEEYY TMMMMBEDOK TMVALERIE TMHUITING TM PRIDEEEE,btohqsg
Idc abt deriving the formula I ALRD KNOW THE BLOODY FORMULA,btohqsg
fck...lah si yan living in hall,btohqsg
cannot take your mala viginity alr,btohqsg
nah can can everyday Friday say sun,btohqsg
bro getting the google drive action,btohqsg
Cuz need derive the addition formula,btohqsg
not meeting u also fun siyan,btohqsg
because..you are just doing the same shit 1000000 ppl have done b4,btohqsg
Bcz iw talk to siyan and his gf,btohqsg
both of them are an interesting pair,btohqsg
But ya I think I do until depressed,btohqsg
my gf got say want meet you meh,btohqsg
sorry iw meet her dw meet u how HUH HUH,btohqsg
Been staring at that shit since 12,btohqsg
omg the OGs know i couldn‚Äôt fix my router.. and I still haven‚Äôt fixed,btohqsg
I don't regret coming to jc,btohqsg
maybe after my sem is over cos i‚Äôm like dying,btohqsg
u want to rot u can rot with me,btohqsg
eh wait is ingrown nail good or,btohqsg
And how do I get rid,btohqsg
god this is cancerous why they blushing,btohqsg
The gahmen out here thinking babies is a jackpot,btohqsg
yk jn i saw on tiktok live,btohqsg
got some helper going around to give people back massage $50 wtf who‚Äôs calling MOM,btohqsg
man i love sg so much,btohqsg
I got a collection of amazing pics of sg,btohqsg
nah..who am i bluffing  but this pics i have are nice as fuck tho,btohqsg
guys insane how 3 months flew by just like that.. vividly remember gude missing out on gude on countdown,btohqsg
If there is one decade you can travel back in time to  what decade would it be?,btohqsg
Time flies when u ‚Äòre engrossed or occupied with stuffs,btohqsg
yea i know..right  i still rmb my first day of sec school,btohqsg
Yea & soon hit ur 20s,btohqsg
i need to find someone that is willing to explore sg with me,btohqsg
So that im able to take pics like these,btohqsg
everytime around this time i always like to think about a singapore i never lived in,btohqsg
But the idea of exams for it,btohqsg
Seeing the compilation of my sch hols hw,btohqsg
Set my ass on fire sia,btohqsg
It's so long until wa put the read more fn,btohqsg
This one u take from online,btohqsg
i never take a single photo,btohqsg
If I stay awake all I gonna do is curse the math gods,btohqsg
you‚Äôre gonna do this either way too,btohqsg
lmao...maybe if you continue tagging her yea,btohqsg
I can probs do the sls eventually,btohqsg
Just that I lazy to rmb,btohqsg
Doing the trigo proving stuff kinda funz tho,btohqsg
probs do it when your brain is fresh,btohqsg
But ya 1 hr of my life I ain't getting back,btohqsg
it's fun when you can take the time to slowly figure out,btohqsg
I chose poly over JC. No matter where you go you should be proud of it regardless.,btohqsg
That said  got pros and cons for each route you go  it's literally just pick your poison. Poly is additional 1 year  but don't forget you have internship and sometimes FYP. I mean real FYP  where if you're in a sci diploma  you legit enter the lab to get your data. Even for internships  people rather hire poly interns than fresh A level interns for lab coz at least the lab education is so much more rigorous for poly students.,btohqsg
It's commonly mentioned in uni sci that JC students are good at theory while poly students are good at lab  and this has been the comment for years.,btohqsg
As long as you know wtf you want from either route and work hard towards it  it's fine. Or if your goals change halfway  that's fine also coz honestly even 30+ yo are doing mid career switch depending on their circumstances. As long as you are clear on what to achieve each time instead of following the crowd  you're on the right track.,btohqsg
my 4D went from 1404 to 1112 üíÄ,btohqsg
...and im going to regret it soon,btohqsg
just different ways to the same destination,btohqsg
This is how catastrophic a fire from a hdb unit can be,btohqsg
I think insurance covers this right,btohqsg
this fire burned for nearly 2 days,btohqsg
you cant even tell which floor caught fire first,btohqsg
how tf did this happen üíÄ,btohqsg
some exploded a bomb or what,btohqsg
It started with a 4th floor unit that caught on fire,btohqsg
The fire spreaded to the top floor of the building within 10 mins of the fire starting on the 4th floor,btohqsg
The biggest reason why the fire manage to engulf to its magnitude was because the fire suppression system in the building was not working,btohqsg
oh wait this happened in uk i thought it happened in sg,btohqsg
its a showcase of how bad a apartment fire can get,btohqsg
idk like i chose jc route because ik i wanted to do sosci/lit,btohqsg
its not like poly provides a dip in literature right lmao,btohqsg
but i wld understand if ppl who like wanna do engineering or smth pursue the dip route cuz i see it that those fields require much more hands on know hows than hardcore thinking thinking,btohqsg
alot of poly kids ik study dip alr,btohqsg
then they dont bother pursuing degree,btohqsg
i mean sosci/lit even at a uni level is always questioned on its ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù and practicality,btohqsg
and those who did i only know one or two who got into loca u,btohqsg
which imho is damn waste money + ur degree from james cook uni gon mean way less than nus degree lul,btohqsg
and i think poly hones in more on that practical side of courses,btohqsg
so i cant afford private uni,btohqsg
thats why i think think think,btohqsg
do i rlly wanna do lit? so i chose sosci instead,btohqsg
idk about your sample size but different people think differently la,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt agree with that mindset either but it‚Äôs their life lor,btohqsg
like for me if you don‚Äôt have a degree your career is gonna hit a ceiling fast,btohqsg
and then theres ppl who drop out of sec sch,btohqsg
yea but like in my friend group there‚Äôs equal poly and jc people,btohqsg
comes down to the individual mindset and how far you‚Äôre really looking into the future,btohqsg
to determine what you wanna do,btohqsg
What if i drop out of ntu and start a chicken rice store'Chicken rice hawker store opened by ex ntu student',btohqsg
This is the harsh reality of Singapore  straight from MOM‚Äôs reporting,btohqsg
EE grad tho not drop out,btohqsg
he just did what he wanted,btohqsg
154 thousand degree holders earn more than 12k a month.14 thousand diploma holders do.If you intend to live comfortably and well  statistically I think a degree is a clear choice in Singapore.Unless you don‚Äôt need much to survive and you‚Äôre happy with earning less but often doing work that is just as hard or only slightly less challenging  finish the degree.,btohqsg
one of the imo dumbest (or ig uninformed/naive) posts i‚Äôve read was someone saying they‚Äôre dropping out of uni cos learning it in sch is killing his passion,btohqsg
I mean it might be valid for that person  but I think many people who do drop out have not really hit the requirement to be able to conclude they can‚Äôt make it,btohqsg
Even if you‚Äôre very deeply distressed  take an LOA,btohqsg
I went to the hospital and it destroyed my GPA but I still graduated on time so  that‚Äôs my take on it,btohqsg
i forgot what else was said exactly  but stuck out to me was basically saying why get a degree and kill your passion when he can get the same skills learning on his own at his own pace,btohqsg
which just showed his lack of understanding of how things work,btohqsg
I am struggling w mech sigh,btohqsg
There is somewhere I did wrongly.,btohqsg
Degrees are just ‚ÄúProof of Work‚Äù like how bitcoin works hahaha  it‚Äôs a terrible proxy for value addition at work but it‚Äôs the best we have,btohqsg
i‚Äôve also commonly seen many people lose passion when going through uni  and tbh a lot of times their passion was just nvr that strong to begin with,btohqsg
or they realise what work actually goes into a field,btohqsg
Why do we even grind in the first place like bye bye mental stability,btohqsg
and then if not AAA then bye bye hopes n dreams,btohqsg
Passion is a valid reason to do or stop doing something  but it needs to be based in some evidence that your alternative path through life will sustain you and make you happy.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a product of the society we live in to think that way,btohqsg
For me I was not a great student but I like the money just a bit more than I hate stress,btohqsg
Yea money is a valid reason too,btohqsg
My issue is more of giving up a passion when things get more technical or less ‚Äúfun‚Äù because they never did their due diligence in seeing what that field is actually about,btohqsg
No la  you just have to be satisfied with less  it‚Äôs not ‚Äúbye bye‚Äù. You still live in a safe and very well ordered society.,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt afford to stay in a swanky condo  but that doesn‚Äôt mean the end of the world  the hedonic treadmill you run needs to be sustained by your ability to create value or emulate value creation.,btohqsg
cos you go straight into your course,btohqsg
that‚Äôs if you alr know what you want by that point which not everyone does,btohqsg
Then be the best in this field. Go to the best university,btohqsg
And not learn things irrelevant such as history for computing etc etc,btohqsg
i mean i‚Äôm doing a PhD in it now,btohqsg
Degree just makes u earn the right to sit for interviews tbh,btohqsg
Whether u can do the work or make your salary worth it is another different thing,btohqsg
also it looks good on paper,btohqsg
it‚Äôs also proof that you can actually learn and pick up technical information at a higher level,btohqsg
i think that‚Äôs like the real value of a degree,btohqsg
Fair  but it‚Äôs uncommon for someone who has a legitimate degree to be unable to function at a minimally acceptable level at work,btohqsg
it‚Äôs proof of competence not proof of knowledge,btohqsg
So that employers know if u were to task to learn a new field of knowledge  u can do it within a certain time,btohqsg
Hearsay the reason why we learn high level maths in uni for STEM course is to make sure they are nt dumb,btohqsg
U dont want doctors that cant solve calcus to do operation on patients,btohqsg
All stem need those skills leh  I can‚Äôt think of any which don‚Äôt,btohqsg
It does get abstracted away at work by a calculator or program of some sort or even excel inherited from the past  but you need to be aware it exists and can re-learn to verify,btohqsg
Coz maths itself is a way to test your logical skills,btohqsg
i mean different areas of math would translate to different fields well,btohqsg
like even if i majored in biology there‚Äôll be specific industries or fields in it that use math,btohqsg
Even if u take psychology u also need statics  which is another field of maths,btohqsg
Funnily enough math is my worst subject after mandarin  so nowadays I just use computers to find math answers lol,btohqsg
ok a big chunk of psychology is actually statistics not just needing it,btohqsg
I use mathematica until i hit a problem that can‚Äôt be solved by it,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt quantum computing right now basically all math anyway,btohqsg
There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal one‚Äù which can hold more than like 50 classical bits,btohqsg
hmm depends on the area you‚Äôre looking at since it‚Äôs so new  meaning different people are working on different aspects,btohqsg
As in a actual logic gate with quantum circuits that can compute an acceptable answer from given inputs  there isn‚Äôt one which has enough qbits which are equivalent to 50 real bits,btohqsg
Oh my bad I just googled it,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs the largest one rn,btohqsg
Been like 6 years since I read the Wikipedia article about it,btohqsg
we are still super far off from getting anything commercially useful yea,btohqsg
I think im the only dumbass that dk how to use wolfram,btohqsg
I tried to plug in the question and it just give me ans,btohqsg
esp since our goal is not to just emulate classical computers but get some sort of quantum supremacy,btohqsg
the math heavy part is rlly in the form of the algorithms and complexity theory,btohqsg
I think you‚Äôre opening Pandora‚Äôs box with all the quantum stuff  stop factoring prime numbers so fast otherwise we no more secrets T_T,btohqsg
the less math heavy (but still heavy since it‚Äôs physics) is figuring out how to optimise the architecture in the first place,btohqsg
like experiments and theories are made on more optimal ways to arrange or connect the qubits,btohqsg
new kinda of qubits and their dynamics,btohqsg
lmao i‚Äôve read this too many times,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the most interesting fact about quantum computing you know right now,btohqsg
hmm idk about most interesting like quantum computers are still at infancy,btohqsg
but i like that we are at the stage where quantum simulators can almost fully mimic several aspects of chemistry,btohqsg
and personally  the issue of noise and decoherence is so big that if we managed to find an optimal path of dealing with it  we will probably see new Moores law for qubits,btohqsg
Now rch limit rdy no meh,btohqsg
i‚Äôm talking about a new kind for qubits,btohqsg
Implies upper bound to qbit based computers right?,btohqsg
yea so big areas now are- algorithms that are more qubit efficient (optimally making use of what we have)- methods of noise reduction- error correction to mitigate the effects of the noise- new types of qubits that are more noise resistant and last longer- architectures that can lose coherence at a slower rate,btohqsg
right now IBM uses superconducting qubits so they are fast but their issue is as they scale up  their architecture has to be quite specific since they can dephase quickly,btohqsg
i‚Äôm working on semiconducting qubits that aren‚Äôt as fast and relies on short range interactions (which sucks when you‚Äôre trying to stop them from interfering with each other)  but they‚Äôd last longer,btohqsg
I got only half of that but it sounds super cool  are you using the IBM quantum computer simulator? How can you test your theories?,btohqsg
SGEXAMS IS RECRUITING! ü•≥We‚Äôre looking for people who want to use your talents to make a difference in the student community. üëÄ Be it in our journalism  education & career guidance or finance departments  we want you! ü´µDon‚Äôt miss out this opportunity to work with like-minded youths  and gain skills and experiences that‚Äôll add colour to your portfolio! üåàLearn about the different departments ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3xuKUsCJoin our committee! ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3YIth4n,btohqsg
Actually now more common to work then go back study or study part time local uni,btohqsg
Mostly is financial independence doing the talking that's why,btohqsg
Otherwise you will need to take loan to directly go study full-time,btohqsg
u guys know theres a 50% off frappes in buckies,btohqsg
Those who know what they are thinking are aware that the degree likely won't translate to work. But then they will also be aware the system in place is no degree = hard-stucked fast. So just get the paper  use it as a last opportunity to do non-work stuff  then move on,btohqsg
There's even work study deg now,btohqsg
I tagged u on the ecg channel üëÄ,btohqsg
i know people that do it,btohqsg
Also if you take loan under family name and you got disagreement it can get quite ugly,btohqsg
Yea basically. It‚Äôs just silly to me when people don‚Äôt know what the actual practical use of the degree is and give it up just because they can get the knowledge elsewhere,btohqsg
Can self-study!! But it's only as good as a supplement,btohqsg
If not everyone can get qualifications already...,btohqsg
but idh the voucher leh starbies scanned alr,btohqsg
i thought student loan is 0% interest,btohqsg
self study is important and i do that a lot but without the structure it‚Äôs quite tough,btohqsg
and the proof of competence isn‚Äôt there,btohqsg
0% until you graduate then it starts,btohqsg
how do student loans work so confusing,btohqsg
my cher told me its 0% interest all the way,btohqsg
all the way until you start working,btohqsg
Tuition loan study loan different ah,btohqsg
so if u take gap yr after isok uh,btohqsg
wat will happen if u drop out of uni,btohqsg
you pay back what you alr took,btohqsg
I think my loan total 30k iirc,btohqsg
I took cpf loan coz my parents made me use my sister's cpf,btohqsg
take cpf loanpay slow and put cash into singapore savings bond,btohqsg
my interest now is like 4.75% per annum,btohqsg
If y'all good term with family  which my friend lucky to have,btohqsg
She took bank loan  then her mum help her pay first,btohqsg
Then between them agreement she pay back the mum but interest free,btohqsg
then govt pause interests on all uni Bank loan for a year,btohqsg
like once i grad they sent me a letter saying they‚Äôll start charging interest from August of that year,btohqsg
Cpf loan bad is the interest starts incurring immediately,btohqsg
yea with the relationship i have with my mum and well finance things id rather just bite the interest bullet,btohqsg
i‚Äôm paying back 1.7k a month so i‚Äôll be done by end of this year,btohqsg
no choice when parents decide.Though i could make a decision to take a personal bank loan myself,btohqsg
I had no idea bank loan was 0%. My parents insist 4% immediately upon withdrawal,btohqsg
entire family income also quite bad,btohqsg
ye so my guess is they‚Äôll start charging you a few months after you drop out,btohqsg
the upside is parents can waive the cpf loan if they are past 55 I think.,btohqsg
im just hoping i can get scholarship,btohqsg
Yea then again if you good terms with parents you can do this,btohqsg
if not its a big financial weight,btohqsg
can i just say DBS was super stupid and not transparent with my loan repayment,btohqsg
But my ahbu wants me to use my sis cpf which I doubted at first coz she can use it for bto,btohqsg
if not how Gupta get his $15mil salary for 2022,btohqsg
i paid back 1.7k each month and then i noticed i‚Äôve been getting charged late fees,btohqsg
can u withdraw only after u grad,btohqsg
But my sis insist it's ok!!!! Tmw she hit 35 she cry later kena chase out... Coz no money buy house,btohqsg
i call them then they say the window of payment per month is 26th to 1st,btohqsg
thats more than my monthly pay,btohqsg
And like my mum got a stacked cpf due to investments,btohqsg
so if i pay at outside that window they‚Äôll charge me late fees still,btohqsg
And she refused to loan me the money yet pushing me to enter uni,btohqsg
so i must make sure i pay within that window,btohqsg
Yup money and family is weirdge situation,btohqsg
i considering if i shld be starbies barista,btohqsg
yea but you adjust how much you pay per month based on your needs,btohqsg
i can survive with 600 a month now,btohqsg
but i saw on the news they give very flexible working hrs,btohqsg
so i save a bit then rest throw to dbs,btohqsg
but if i work two odd jobs + study,btohqsg
Actually more and more common poly keeds are working part-time,btohqsg
im just hoping i can pay off some loans and hall fees,btohqsg
or at minimum pay off hall fees so i can just pay off tuition debt after grad,btohqsg
actly idk if i wanna stay in hall,btohqsg
Depends if distance is an issue,btohqsg
And also whether you want hall culture,btohqsg
not bad leh. When I first graduated I needed average $900 monthly,btohqsg
Uni life? I need to study,btohqsg
yea but tbf i still in ntu so canteen food prices,btohqsg
Ok lah I don't do those,btohqsg
only dip into more for like celebrations,btohqsg
u can dont study ah just drop out oni,btohqsg
I don't even turn up on campus unless I gotta,btohqsg
i‚Äôm probs staying hall next sem just for mental health reasons lol,btohqsg
If got meet the parents session for uni my prof sure dunno got this student,btohqsg
I'm that type go campus make full use of the facilities since I'm paying for it,btohqsg
trying to see if i can be a graduate hall mentor meaning my hall fees can get cut by 60%,btohqsg
I need to travel to use the facility so that's money tooo,btohqsg
n then theres me where my prof calls my name to ask if i got A again,btohqsg
But ya I tend to stay in school and study if I already on campus,btohqsg
I delayed getting a smartphone until iPhone 4S came out,btohqsg
i might build my pc and station it in my ntu office,btohqsg
Actually just sleep in phd office,btohqsg
I see people bring hugeass soft toy,btohqsg
esp if i end up in ntu,btohqsg
ntu 2 1/2-3 hrs per trip,btohqsg
NTU is far for almost anyone tbh,btohqsg
I actively track all expenses because I went all out to scrimp and save every single thing,btohqsg
so in total i‚Äôll be spending 5-6hrs on travelling alone,btohqsg
yea but rn the problem is traveling  so if i get hall i can just sleep in hall right,btohqsg
LOL maybe look at some bus alternatives,btohqsg
my office rn has 2 people only including me btw,btohqsg
+ during exams szn i rlly want to avoid having yo travel around,btohqsg
waiting for this other guy to grad,btohqsg
then again if its nus i wld need to take a considerable amt of ccas to retain hall spot uh so,btohqsg
i spent around 200 bucks last month,btohqsg
Feb - March is my poorest time of the year,btohqsg
about there. So when I first graduated  I worked near 80 hrs weekly,btohqsg
i dabao food from home so i can save moolahz,btohqsg
full time engineer + full time tutor at the same time,btohqsg
i wish my contract didn‚Äôt restrict me to not taking a secondary job,btohqsg
u calculate wld still be cheaper than like eating out,btohqsg
which is also why i want go nus hall,btohqsg
since they serve breakfast and dinner when u cut around it ure paying around 200-300 bucks for the place itself,btohqsg
traveling to ntu SUCKS when you don‚Äôt get concessions like undergrads do,btohqsg
the trip from my home to nus is almost equivalent,btohqsg
freelance can but i have trouble finding also nowadays,btohqsg
atp its almost like me getting hall = me buying food + spending trasport cost,btohqsg
+ i get to save up on time,btohqsg
if putting it as an equivalent la,btohqsg
i give and take calculate as 5 bucks per meal,btohqsg
for me i‚Äôm ok with paying for hall cos it was a better environment for me to work,btohqsg
if im being frugal i‚Äôll dabao from hall breakfasts + dinner,btohqsg
o i thought rc no meals?,btohqsg
wait then whats the diff sia,btohqsg
with my schedule i might just eat breakfast and dinner,btohqsg
now I add more insights for u,btohqsg
wld figure like if u alr eat bad cookhouse food anyth seems okay for u,btohqsg
family with 3 kids  expenses near 6k monthly,btohqsg
with my schedule back in jc i used to eat one dinner,btohqsg
my pengyous all got good food review of everything else,btohqsg
‚Äúanything else is better than cookhouse‚Äù,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just gonna stick to getting cats,btohqsg
lol cookhouse also got variation la,btohqsg
majority goes to paying home mortgage,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what my gf has in ntu rn,btohqsg
if my roomie can wake me up to go lessons it wld be amaze balls,btohqsg
eh for me it‚Äôs like sometime i need or want to be alone,btohqsg
but personal toilrt u need wash urself,btohqsg
mortgage almost 1k a month.Utilities almost $500Kids childcare $1.5k,btohqsg
People pee on toilet bowl seat,btohqsg
then splurge a bitcar petrol + parking + maintenance $1kMaid $800Food $1k++,btohqsg
my house uses 3 aircon almost every night‚Ä¶,btohqsg
i tried staying with roomie for two years la,btohqsg
third year i tried single and it was the best decision in my life,btohqsg
ya I stay with in laws and have a helper. Total like 8 ppl,btohqsg
wtfuck u guys need basic hygiene lessons,btohqsg
you say this but in ntu halls  the girls toilets are always way worse and disgusting like the group chats always got people take pics show,btohqsg
3 kids all not P sch yet,btohqsg
yall be popping out babies fast,btohqsg
and like they‚Äôre cleaned every single day quite well,btohqsg
livin zhao sheng gui zi to the fullest,btohqsg
so one day also can fuck up,btohqsg
many things u can't see now,btohqsg
idk how yall like make until so messy man,btohqsg
girls complain how others throw their pads on the floor LOL,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a sch specific thing,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just see your luck of who lives near you,btohqsg
perhaps ur gf kenna some hall mate damn lak tak one,btohqsg
except the occasional neat piece of paper placed on the board for some reason,btohqsg
i mean my experience in hall with male toilets has never been bad,btohqsg
i scream scramp scrumpt when i saw,btohqsg
this isn‚Äôt a gender thing LOL,btohqsg
just who wants to be disgusting,btohqsg
they go and roll toilet paper until nice nice one piece and then put on the mini table top in the toilet,btohqsg
ppl with period blood in the toilet bowl,btohqsg
i ran out of the toilet so quick,btohqsg
someone shit until it‚Äôs on the floor also,btohqsg
there is literally a sign now on the handicap toilet btw that says pls dispose of your sanitary pads properly,btohqsg
happened before in student hostel when I was in Germany,btohqsg
BUT AT LEAST GET RID OF IT RIGHT,btohqsg
idk whats so funny abt that,btohqsg
my time pri sch have already,btohqsg
because the principle said don't do  I also went to do. Originally don't know  the principal scold the whole sch until I interested,btohqsg
i too overworked in JC to know what's happening,btohqsg
ad there were massive talk abt lesbians,btohqsg
only 4 chapters done. I busy eating lunch,btohqsg
then alot of shit was going EORNNNN,btohqsg
seems like a common girls school thing leh,btohqsg
I rushing by end Feb originally,btohqsg
the teachers had to take turns patrolling the toilets to stop lesbian behavior üõë,btohqsg
