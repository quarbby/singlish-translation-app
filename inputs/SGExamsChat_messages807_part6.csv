go for it. you have to start somewhere,btohqsg
management trainee is a good thing because they are investing in you as an employee,btohqsg
(+ singapore airlines bonus is huge),btohqsg
+ Singapore airlines on resume is chef's kiss,btohqsg
One of my friends tried to apply for Singapore airlines laboratory personell,btohqsg
He got accepted but he could not past the last interview,btohqsg
I think she needs to say no more,btohqsg
I'm tryna get a scholarship there,btohqsg
they promote you quickly because they have an internal need to justify the initial investment.,btohqsg
I told my parents i want to work for Singapore Airlines and they were like ‘this is the consequence of bringing me overseas’,btohqsg
Wait if my a lvl rabak I can use o lvl right,btohqsg
Coz sq jobs are mostly entry level i can go fr A levels,btohqsg
sia is legit a good employer though,btohqsg
Singapore airlines can apply through o levels as well,btohqsg
Alot of stewardess apply through their o levels,btohqsg
and no  they have jobs for degree holders too,btohqsg
I mean they already know i like to fly and love SQ and ANA,btohqsg
unless you really wanna go for ground staff/stewardess/baggage handler,btohqsg
But they were more of they dun pay 4y of my uni for this,btohqsg
I can tell u most jobs are usually what is seen as boring. Like administrators,btohqsg
But it's required and got opening usually,btohqsg
Tbh I think Alot of stewardess or stewards get into the job because their family situation would not have allowed them to travel the world,btohqsg
Got any more SIA job positions I can apply,btohqsg
So they use that precise job to do that,btohqsg
catering staff  ground staff  laboratory staffGot license can drive vehicles like the emas vehicle,btohqsg
Im just scared my parents will throw eggs at me,btohqsg
this is their version of a management trainee program,btohqsg
a path to management-level positions in sia,btohqsg
a really sweet deal  if you can get in,btohqsg
Basically my parents is of the thinking that the degree is wasted and they spent 4y of uni for nth,btohqsg
Lmao make scrambled eggs and serve them  tell them it's Singapore airlines special,btohqsg
But again it is my life  my work,btohqsg
they have blinkers on. a pharma degree doesn't mean you have to do pharma. having a one-track mind turns a degree into a liability rather than an asset,btohqsg
It is not sth new that i hv brought up to them that i like the aviation industry,btohqsg
I think working with SIA will be Lit tbh,btohqsg
Like I love working with planes,btohqsg
That's basically what I said since the start  you are still trying to get over the reality that your parents really spent a bunch of their money on you so you have to process something of worth to them,btohqsg
But st the same time balancing your own interest and dreams for your own future,btohqsg
But now they are saying it is a consequence of bringing me overseas,btohqsg
To peak my interest even more,btohqsg
It is  that's why alot of ppl apply for sia,btohqsg
It is not just that but my parents are the typical over-controlling ones,btohqsg
I mean im not the only one w a uni degree that looks to join sia,btohqsg
And like I said they are using filial piety and other aspect of your life as a negotiating and bargaining tool,btohqsg
One of my snrs grad fr life sci applied to air stewardess  sth that just needs O / A levels qualifications,btohqsg
they literally have a program  especially for university graduates. your parents must be mad if they think an organisation like sia doesn't need highly educated degree holders for certain jobs,btohqsg
There are 19 yr old sia stewardess flying right now,btohqsg
I can convince my dad but not my mum,btohqsg
My dad is more lax than my mum who just everything by the book,btohqsg
Ah yes the best civil servant,btohqsg
