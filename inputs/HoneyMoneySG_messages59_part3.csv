Hi guys  any idea if overpay your electric/ telco bill using citipayall can count at promo to earn 2.2 miles?,btohqsg
Any risks in money market funds as recommended in the clip? I first time buy.,btohqsg
Anyone putting their idle cash on StashAway simple guaranteed? Itâ€™s 3.65% for a lock in of 6 months? Any reviews on this?,btohqsg
Not sdic insured but backed by citibank if I'm not wrong. Not a bad deal,btohqsg
why pay fees when u can get miles/points without fees? dun think possible to pay these unless u have the bank numbers.,btohqsg
can get miles on some cards,btohqsg
Yeah cause stashaway isn't a bank,btohqsg
May I know which card recommend to use for utilities bill?,btohqsg
Though the simple guaranteed is supposed to be citibank fixed Deposit. Still not directly insured,btohqsg
Pay utilities using Citi payall donâ€™t need bank account number.,btohqsg
lock 6 months might as well get t-bills,btohqsg
I missed the boatttt because I go bid at 3.87% ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
For Philips smart park  do you all use poems mobile 3 or poems SG 2.0?,btohqsg
Maybank fixed D at 3.9% 12mths. Better than most ssb and tbill?,btohqsg
I thought new TBill is released every two weeks?,btohqsg
I think they reduced it to 3.75% and for every 10k you must deposit 1k of cash so the EIR becomes 3.4+%,btohqsg
Oh I havenâ€™t done T bills before I missed it the first round will try it again next round and keep a lookout for it since itâ€™s only earning 2.5% in cpfoa,btohqsg
For now looks like T bills are better than most low risk investments,btohqsg
By the way  is there any way we can buy into Amundi prime USA fund without going through Endowus? - (I donâ€™t feel safe when it has so much losses) And possible to use cash as well?Can anyone advise on this?,btohqsg
May I know the ssb interests will stop base on your request redeem or the last date of the month when u request redeem?,btohqsg
Hmm why amundi?The reason why people use amundi for endowus instead of lion global is the management fee. 0.3% vs. 0.6%If you're not bound to endowus e.g. cpf oa or srsThen cspx directly on ibkr would be much cheaper,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany particular reason why you donâ€™t directly buy into S&P500 on the trading platform but instead go though Amundi Prime USA fund via endowus?,btohqsg
Because cspx management fee is 0.05%,btohqsg
But cspx is not as liquid as spy ?,btohqsg
You may want to google some analysis written by other on CPF OA TBill before making decision. Although you will earn 6 months interest from TBill but you may loss 7-8 months of interest from CPF-OA.,btohqsg
I m trying to automate dca on a monthly basis into 3 funds like Chris  but I find it extremely hard to decide on the 3 funds.,btohqsg
Hmm yes but cspx has 15% dividend tax compared to 30%,btohqsg
Based on the video did by Chris  seems like heâ€™s trying to do the Boglehead 3 fund portfolio..,btohqsg
Whats the MCC for engagement wedding band if I want to buy it from Tiffany and co,btohqsg
Im using cpf to invest s&p500  not cash,btohqsg
Do you mean amundi or endowus loss?,btohqsg
And amundi have no dividend because itâ€™s reinvest  correct?,btohqsg
The losses are ok for a startup company in the first 2 years. Also ur money is with uob kh  so even if endowus goes bust u most probably still can get ur money. Buying snp using cpf or srs only endowus can do. If using cash should buy from elsewhere cuz fees cheaper,btohqsg
I'm sorry can I check with you guy got any guru here know about the 3.5% promotion becausethe full terms and conditions of3.50% p.a. on their incremental fresh funds are very confusing to meI'm an existing customer of CIMB. My July 2023 month-end balance isÂ  SGD10and I deposited SGD75000 into my CIMB fastsaver account on 1 August 2023and I accidentallyÂ transferred the SGD75000 to my other bank account on 5 August 2023.and IÂ deposited SGD1000 back to my CIMB fastsaver accountÂ on 5 August 2023hence the day-end balance on 5 August 2023 on my CIMB fastsaver account is SGD1010May I know if I transfer all my money back to my CIMB fastsaver account on 7 August 2023 am I still eligible to earn 3.5% interest from 7 AuguestÂ 2023untilÂ 31 Jan '24,btohqsg
Because thereâ€™s a rule on 4. c and 5. c,btohqsg
I was referring to endowus actually,btohqsg
I'm in the midst of rebalancing my investment portfolio and sort of decided to migrate everything from Tiger to Moomoo. Is there a way to do a direct funds transfer from Tiger to Moomo without going thru my bank?,btohqsg
Main concern is I don't want to convert my USD back to SGD just to convert everything back to USD again.,btohqsg
Hi  you should have satisfied clause 4c because FastSaver is a savings account.For clause 5c I'm quite convinced you should also have satisfied it since the comparison is 31 July 2023 end day balance. So the deposit of 75k into your FastSaver account on 1 Aug (if this 75k doesn't originate from cimb) qualifies for incremental funds compared to 31 July. Other subsequent withdrawals and deposits during Aug doesn't matter.Just my interpretation but you may like to check with cimb on clause 5c to confirm.,btohqsg
Hello. For EGA bonus interest promotion  can I withdraw all the money inside right after the last participating month (i.e. July). Bonus interest will only be credited 31 Sep and the customer service officer recommended I keep the month in EGA until i receive the bonus.,btohqsg
