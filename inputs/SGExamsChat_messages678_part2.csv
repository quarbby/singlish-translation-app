bro fr just accepted she is a lost cause,btohqsg
Good actually i regretted taking h3 math  waste of time staying back late after sch nd all that provingâ€¦,btohqsg
he ltr will call me stupid one,btohqsg
bc i just asked a qn there,btohqsg
I didnt  coz it is fun to just listen but exam is NOT fun  i think almost the whole paper was blank,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i agree w u man,btohqsg
But i was only offered math,btohqsg
I thought h3 geog would be the easiest to get distinction since itâ€™s a research paper then can just bs random stuff,btohqsg
I may hv taken h3 chem if i got offered,btohqsg
But my chem only was high lvl in j2,btohqsg
The grade boundaries for h3 math are very low,btohqsg
Coz i ended up like focusing on my H2 H1,btohqsg
Which subj do yall feel is hardest,btohqsg
Coz i really actually wanted that 4 As,btohqsg
My friend who took h3 math said he thinks he got around 50-60% but still got distinction,btohqsg
I actually dk coz i mug to the grades,btohqsg
Maybe 55 is alr distinction for h3 math,btohqsg
Idk if this is an simpler explanation for long division,btohqsg
So the paper was easy not becoz im smart  it is because of all the grinding lmao,btohqsg
WAH but i mean it is expected,btohqsg
20% for h3 math is probably merit,btohqsg
Sekali pass for h3 math is like just 25%,btohqsg
the only h3 subject with similar grade boundaries to llike a normal h2 subject is like,btohqsg
cuz h3 physics is uniornically just h2 physics + more math,btohqsg
acc to most of my frens,btohqsg
I thought that would be pass,btohqsg
I wished i was smarter in chem in j1,btohqsg
Then i can take h3 chem,btohqsg
lol man prob saw it online then tot y not?,btohqsg
But h3 math is super super dry,btohqsg
Maybe distinction is not even 50%,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a 4 above and below,btohqsg
its the same as 4 divide 4,btohqsg
very stupid like what crimson said,btohqsg
If u wanna do abit longer  its 16 divided by 4 which is 4,btohqsg
is quotient tge on top thing,btohqsg
Try relate this to the simpler one previous,btohqsg
then the beside thr thing is dividend,btohqsg
but idk how to do for fraction,btohqsg
what is ny friend eveb writing,btohqsg
i only know the x square minus 2x,btohqsg
idk where she get the 4 from,btohqsg
wtf is that supposed to mean lol,btohqsg
but where did the 4 even come from,btohqsg
U must think of a number that can multiply,btohqsg
In order to get rid of the remainders until the simplest form,btohqsg
but thr 4 come frol where,btohqsg
Just take ur time to read this,btohqsg
i dont hv the amath tb,btohqsg
Just read steps 3 and 4,btohqsg
