Haha usually is when performance bad and got cash...will do sbb,btohqsg
but they failed the defence vs shortists today,btohqsg
So if tiger is approved by cdp   does it mean  the shares parked at cdp   can be traded thru tiger even though   we bought the shares from the broking house? Or still need to transfer the share over... how does it work? Any expert here...🙏,btohqsg
Nothing is confirmed yet. Only the approval has been received,btohqsg
We need to check with tiger whether they can set up the link to cdp,btohqsg
If they can   you will get an option to sell / buy from cdp,btohqsg
HAHA they can all go close shop,btohqsg
Ibkr  moomoo  tiger all so good,btohqsg
Yup... I guess if tiger is linked that means should be able to sell thru them..,btohqsg
Tiger might choose to limit what they offer to their clients.E.g FSM can sell from CDP but they don’t allow you to buy to CDP.,btohqsg
Dun allow to buy and keep at cdp?,btohqsg
I started using Tiger everything are good and CHEAP,btohqsg
What you buy thru   where the shares go to?,btohqsg
If buy through FSM then goes to custodian,btohqsg
How much is FSM charge for selling from cdp?,btohqsg
Current cheapest CDP comms setup should still be buy with DBSV cash up front and sell through FSM,btohqsg
I guess I can start selling thru FSM,btohqsg
$8 comms excluding trading fees and gst,btohqsg
Cash up front then remisier no commission right?,btohqsg
This hack has been around for about 5 / 6 years I think,btohqsg
Because I told my remisier I want to cash up front last time he reluctant to do it for me lol,btohqsg
Anyway  I prefer custodian for short term trading and penny stocks,btohqsg
CDP only for long term cap gain and div stocks because corp. action is faster,btohqsg
🤔🤦‍♂pai sei to my remisier...bo bian  hung zheng bai  must look for cheapest broking fees... but must be safe too...😂🤔,btohqsg
If you’re under Treasures then hearsay their comms not very ex also,btohqsg
Any difference between short and long term   be it at custodian or cdp?,btohqsg
Difficult to attend agm if using custodian?,btohqsg
No actual difference  more or less a preference for me being old school who still wants to maintain my CDP account.Many young investors I know only got custodian account.,btohqsg
You will have to apply through your broker,btohqsg
But there is annual custodian charge,btohqsg
Yes  need to send them email to respond to the company that you wish to attend. Cannot just walk in with IC.,btohqsg
Usually I don't attend the agm one...🤔😂,btohqsg
Ah I didn't know that. Thanks,btohqsg
Well   no point using dbs treasure to trade then,btohqsg
Can be cheaper than $8 / $10,btohqsg
