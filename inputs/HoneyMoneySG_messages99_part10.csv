Anyone able to advise regarding OCBC 360 . If we put in 100k in 15/3  credit card spent 600 on 27/3  when does the bank start paying the higher interest rate?,btohqsg

Hi  is it possible to request and be granted a waiver of FX fee charge for Citi Rewards Credit Card?,btohqsg
Sorry  would that be 6 miles/dollar  so $200 is 1200 miles?,btohqsg
You only earn extra 2 miles on top of usual 4 miles if paired with Lady account. Without Lady account  you still get 4 miles.,btohqsg
anyone know whether UOB can issue Cashier Order in USD?,btohqsg
Any new promo for Citibank card,btohqsg
Account opened in 14/3.  CC spending in single 600plus on 27/3.,btohqsg
Must you use the physical amaze card  or virtual card stored in Apple wallet can?,btohqsg
I believe your transaction shall bepostedbefore 31 Mar. I presume you don’t have salary credited in Mar.You need to call CSO to check do they prorate your account.If no prorated  you shall earn 1.8% pa for 16 days.If there is prorated on your account  you shall earn 2.1% in Mar.,btohqsg

Dear experts. Are there any methods to earn rewards by paying credit card fees? 😆,btohqsg
Hi  I signed up for SC simply cash in Nov 23 and received the $500 reward in Mar 24,btohqsg
U jus see it in ur statement? And suddenly got $500 to spend?,btohqsg
I applied in Sep promo and yet to receive. How do we check or who to contact? Thanks,btohqsg
Received email as I signed up via Sing saver,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Citi rewards fairprice”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Same.. I also yet to receive.. I have no idea how to check or who to contact 😬,btohqsg
I think I saw this before. You may want read clause 1.5 in ocbc infinity TnC.,btohqsg
I’m in China now and use both Alipay and WeChat.For cards  I use a combination of YouTrip (for small value like metro  which is usually <$1) and CRMC+Amaze for other payments. Do note some MCC maybe excluded from CRMC  e.g. restaurants in Disneyland (4722).,btohqsg
cannot add amaze to apple  need to use physical card or amaze in googlepay,btohqsg
yes provided not via apple/google pay,btohqsg
Actually  you can  but only if you're using it for online/in-app payments.(I do so to pay for things like Apple Music)You can't add it to Apple Pay for paying via Paywave.,btohqsg
Settings > Your face (apple ID) > Payment and Shipping > Add Payment Method(Not really Apple Pay  but in case you want to pay for an in-app payment w Apple),btohqsg
Got a call from DBS RM. Apparently  knowing the interest rate for UOB and OCBC will likely be revised they ask me if I want to consider put the funds into DBS. Their saving account offer is not attractive. Also  I dont know if they have funds comparable to UOB United SG fund which you can get some returns on monthly basis. The only thing I taking advantage of DBS is their once in a while 3.6%FD for 3 months which I dont know if they will still continue.,btohqsg
If they cannot offer something decent  why are they calling you in the first place?,btohqsg
I recently did a 3.3% SD for 3 mths with DBS. But its for fulfillment for some new member rewards then i did this. Adding up about 6+%.,btohqsg
That I wont know. But if they observed my account history  I have been moving money out from my DBS out. And I have a few FD with DBS that is going to mature soon and I will probably move the funds out as well.,btohqsg
Legit. Your offer is damn gd  I’ll use it. The best I got before is spend 100  get back 50,btohqsg
Physical or google pay can  but apply pay still doesn't recognize amaze card,btohqsg
Mari Invest giving 3.64% daily interest,btohqsg
take and cancel it 2 mths ltr😂 not sure does it work this way,btohqsg
Once you use this rebate offer for not cancelling  citi cso says can only cancel 12mths later,btohqsg
hmmmm prob not as good as cancelling and waiting it out to become a new customer and get a new ipad or smthg?,btohqsg
You are right. I was enticed by even that $50. Should have known better 😅 didn’t realise got to tie down another 12mths to cancel  they purposely didn’t mention,btohqsg
yeaaa cos cheaper to retain u then welcome u back as a new customer😂,btohqsg
actually curious question anyone knows how does singsaver make money through their promos for new customers though?,btohqsg
Who still putting 20k in core account (formerly chocolate finance) for 4.5%.,btohqsg
They asked me to keep for 1 year. Else they will ask me to take back the cashback.,btohqsg
I am still doing it. Why?,btohqsg
