avarga might need more time to consolidate  0.28 resistance too strong need time to wear down.. 0.25 remain good support for now,btohqsg

Holding it for the mid term now  hopefully it breaks out soon!,btohqsg
can hold should be no prob üëç good luck!,btohqsg
Now then got time catch upAnyway friend I never had issues with your high targets regardless how absurd or realistic. To showcase your confidence or so  I feel is perfectly fineWhat I see as an issue are misleading statements which to u are showcase of confidence but one glance is coated with unsupported optimism.An example is claims of superb results which you cannot back up withOr latest example: chor avarga dividends 3-5% of share price. Your words not mine.I argued conversely on how unsustainable this view is and no counter-argument factually from u except indirect personal attacks. I did not indulge in it with you doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm incapable of doing so.Another example is your display of confidence which is a thin fine line of misleading. Definite terms such as surely  confirm  100% etc. nothing is for sure in the market and there is a fear of your 100% confidence (which you also won‚Äôt blindly believe) but your display as such will lead to others having the wrong ideaAvarga 6 months will rise 100%. Recall? Got 100% confidence? I don‚Äôt think soNot digging past wounds or grudges but just sincerely hope you will mind future languagesCan be very sure the next time something like that happens again  I will be pointing it out and hopefully by then u engage in a factual argument or retract the statement.Welcome back,btohqsg
Hmm so JT 90 cents TP is ok?,btohqsg
I never say not ok before. Attainable anot is another thingI never say never in market one. Not me to use definitive terms,btohqsg
Maybe their chemical can make fentanyl leh sure Huat,btohqsg
Ya.Dude.. Noted your concern.. Times are bad.. Many people might lose their job and become traders with no experience in this field. By shouting those absurd calls might really cause damage to someone that is desperate of money.. News that committing suicide due to trading might comes from shouters too.. Will be more careful with words next time.. Do give me benefit of doubt if I overhyped at times.. Cheers.. üçªüçªGreat month ahead,btohqsg
If u think JT maker cap is worth $1.8b then achievable lor,btohqsg

I like how you phrase it hahaha.ÊúâÂ¢®Ê∞¥,btohqsg
Birthday suit as many called it,btohqsg

CoZ they trade at times where stop loss is stupid. Buy every dip and eventually all come back tpSounds like recent times though,btohqsg
That's why I tag you to shoot you,btohqsg
i am just a trader who look at patterns,btohqsg
Because he pattern more than badminton,btohqsg
ok la. just dyodd your money,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think is an issueAs long justifiable.I mean the market is all on guesstimatesExample u presume the profit will double by next statement due to robotics biz blah blahThen profits double. Give a certain PE u come to $1 for exampleIt‚Äôs afterall a basis. Robust or not subject to scrutiny and discussion but that‚Äôs how one can get various viewpoints to correct accordingly. The type of discussion I hope is embraced here,btohqsg
Bro furion you remember someone long ago said after placement the price sure drop one,btohqsg
the thing is i don‚Äôt even know sometime about the true value. my way of trading is just pattern. same as how Sed when it cross 64c  i knew its a big crazy one up due to flat accumulation.Let me say first all my ‚Äúcalls‚Äù are based off pattern and shapes.,btohqsg
He said his professor teach him a ne,btohqsg
I just mentioned him today at the other group,btohqsg
this is how i make my 121 call in medtec. few week ago i said bounce off wedge resistance. if not i cut. simple,btohqsg
Prof say eps drop. Sure drop,btohqsg
I remember I got flamed so badly,btohqsg
You said you mention him wor,btohqsg
People got finance prof. Who am I to say otherwise,btohqsg
last time someone say share dilution eps drophis uni finance prof will kill him if he says otherwise,btohqsg
not sure whats the highlight here... he got uni finance prof or whatanyway what is definite in the market?,btohqsg
I only remember bro furion helped me out,btohqsg
Because he take out his professor wor,btohqsg
The point beingHe‚Äôs very definitive about itSure drop coz eps dropWhich I can‚Äôt accept,btohqsg
He can‚Äôt take a video but screenshots.At point of placement. Kindergarten also know eps drop don‚Äôt need any prof.Purpose of funds? ROA? Value of acquisitions? Bigger production plant? Earnings accretive?So many reasons to explain why a placement can be goodHaven‚Äôt even move to cost of capital/ equity etc. topics for another daySo I don‚Äôt know how one can be so damn sure about something that involves so many variables,btohqsg
