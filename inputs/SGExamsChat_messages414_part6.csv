I know some people that would and do,btohqsg
so I'm at my future sch nus. JOKING AH RELAX PLZ,btohqsg
I‚Äôm really jealous of your closet then.,btohqsg
nah I have turned them down multiple times,btohqsg
their money would be wasted on me,btohqsg
actually I‚Äôm not but I‚Äôm perfectly content with wearing a small variety of things,btohqsg
who knows thanks to ur help..,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs going to end well.,btohqsg
i think im more of a disaster than u,btohqsg
I can learn while waiting for my results,btohqsg
maybe a bit more context on what you‚Äôre looking for,btohqsg
This close to singing take a hint to you.,btohqsg
to both comp engi and science,btohqsg
Do you know any coding yet,btohqsg
I need to learn or gg,btohqsg
ok go find a basic online course to python then,btohqsg
I am guessing they will teach in the notes,btohqsg
I mean there‚Äôs notes but the best way to learn any form of programming is by doing,btohqsg
notes is good for theory stuff that may be good to know,btohqsg
Actually yea coursera like what Bedok said LOL,btohqsg
Find like a basic python course,btohqsg
Exactly. I don‚Äôt understand why more people don‚Äôt use it.,btohqsg
iirc you can‚Äôt get certification without paying but many of them can still do the work and stuff?,btohqsg
As an NTU student I get a ton of certificates for free heh,btohqsg
And tbh if you just search ‚Äúbasic python online course free‚Äù or smth,btohqsg
But Coursera is mainly taught by actual professionals,btohqsg
Unless your guardian has the subscription membership for it,btohqsg
I‚Äôd rather you just take the hint.,btohqsg
Sorry ah you got phd in comp,btohqsg
uh you dont learn by reading notes,btohqsg
yeah I dont know what to do alright,btohqsg
Thats why I am asking yall,btohqsg
He doesnt have to be sarcastic right,btohqsg
so you dont bother to listen to an actual suggestion  to which a comp science major has alr mentioned  he just happened to remention it,btohqsg
"doesnt mean hes not in comp science means he doesnt have the memory of yesterday where i mentioned ""datacamp"" and ""coursera""",btohqsg
"dont shut people down just because they dont reply ""nicely""",btohqsg
hes tryna help but youre calling him toxic so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
I would obv pick up his advice,btohqsg
its basic manners to listen to people's suggestions as well and not repeat the same question you and others have asked literally a day ago,btohqsg
Theres no need to be rude,btohqsg
do you expect us to not be tired that we have to repeat our statement just because someone did not take note of our response? werent even rude and even if you considered his response to be rude  at least he helped. doesnt mean everyone has to be all bubbly in response for you to absorb,btohqsg
I will shut up now gwyn tell me ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
I am not chronically online  I dont remember,btohqsg
if you have that mindset  youre going into university expecting every lecturer to me smiling and kind  do you really expect to learn in that environment? stop assuming everyone will be spoon feeding you the knowledge if youre just gonna shutdown just because you cant take in a little bit of annoyance,btohqsg
Is it so hard to be nice,btohqsg
"not everyone has to live up to what you consider as ""nice""",btohqsg
You considered Bedok‚Äôs sass to be rude? He is less harsh than I am.,btohqsg
"if you want to get into uni with the mindset that every student will help you with a smile on their face  and you start shutting people out just because they ""are not nice to you"" then trust me  some of the best students will not help you. you go in with the closed off mindset that ""oh hes rude im gonna shut him down"" youre not gonna get any feedback or responses. doesnt mean that you expect people to be kindhearted means that they will always help you. we all have our own lives and we are taking the damn time to help you thru our busy days and your response is ""hes rude im gonna shut him out""then really think again  whether youre coming here for actual advice and feedback  or just expecting the ""nice ones"" to spoon feed you with the resources because you cant do your own research about it.",btohqsg
Whats this group for? Berating and looking down on people who are new to courses and need help,btohqsg
You know many people told me the groups pretty toxic,btohqsg
