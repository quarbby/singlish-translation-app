It like I drive a car ok passanger walk way and said the pathway is slippy when I skid,btohqsg
They purposely wanna tick people off! Sometimes  they will play brake checks with you,btohqsg
Too much brainwashing from watching America shows.,btohqsg
Dunno how they pass the driving test...,btohqsg
Why dont say himself blind  the drain cover is there for years....,btohqsg
Many simply smoke their way through and get that license. Once probation over  high code is forgotten! There’re so many trucks driving on right and middle lanes these days. All damn ignore High Way code sia!,btohqsg
Land of the freedom to sue,btohqsg
America mindset very different from Asians. They are everything about “me”  “my” and “I”! Sibei self centric. It’s not about community and society at large. That’s why they screwed up big time and start blaming other countries for overtaking them. What a lame country!,btohqsg
You are damn right. Just like the expats ideology they have,btohqsg
Be an expat and screw up locals,btohqsg
Gone were the days where ONLY white skin are expats and all living the high life. I’ve seen many Ang Moh leading a down to earth life in Singapore as waiters as bartenders. Not everyone are Directors or CEO.,btohqsg
Just glad the expats here are generally well behaved,btohqsg
Except some black sheep who thinks they are still in their colonial days and some Banking or IT expat who think Singaporean owes them big favours in contributing to our economy.,btohqsg
pls cheap to become director in spore,btohqsg
even the conman is a director  they still drive mcclaren,btohqsg
But to be fair   they are good at creating great company,btohqsg
Like google   Apple   tesla and such,btohqsg
They are very good in executing new ideas that will change the economy,btohqsg
Thought when cycling  supposed to siam drain covers?,btohqsg
no use. china is better at creating good companies simply by copying them.. save a lot time n money😂,btohqsg
Can’t said so   look at Apple google China have no replacement for it,btohqsg
Tesla is also doing a very good job,btohqsg
is Kia Sonet a good buy in singapore thou its not very popular,btohqsg
Look at the computer we using and our email,btohqsg
Zoom   window all are from them,btohqsg
But China now got TikTok more to come,btohqsg
Sir I don’t speak Oogalook lah… 😶,btohqsg
I’ve seen ang mo grab food rider too.. lucky never come fight with me for rickshaw pulling,btohqsg
Even my 🐕 jump over the drain cover  🐕 is afraid of its paw 🐾 getting stuck 😂He ride into the drain cover blindly.Strike 4D also not so accurate 😂Wanna sue LTA for his own carelessness 😅,btohqsg

It is a good car in that segment,btohqsg
More features compared to the Toyota raize for sure,btohqsg
Can consider having a look at the Hyundai venue too,btohqsg
Not so popular because many go for the vezel at that price point which offers slightly more space,btohqsg
In terms of power  sonet is only 2nd to the arona,btohqsg
But sonet uses a CVT while arona uses the VW group dsg,btohqsg
Same powertrain as in the 1.5 golf,btohqsg
Many people have doubts about the sonet as it is manufactured at Kia's indian facility compared to the venue that comes from Korea or the Arona that is made in Spain. But  in terms of quality standards  the Sonet still maintains the same level as that of the venue since they are essentially the same cars built on the same platform,btohqsg
kinda worried that if deciding on sonet  how hard would it be to find a good maintenance and servicing for it,btohqsg
Definitely no argument about their innovation aspects. That’s why they are still number ONE in their economic prowess! However  I have grave concern as many of their innovation seems stagnant! Apple has not innovate much compared to Samsung  Huawei or Xiao Mi. NASA has also stop sending people up in space. Worrying sia,btohqsg
how about the 2021 hyundai avante,btohqsg
The west seemed to lead most of the innovation in the past  but just talk about cars these days  it’s Japanese cars that dominate the World and Korean is catching up.,btohqsg
Maintenance not hard  after all it is a regular kia/Hyundai,btohqsg
Most cars in their lineup share parts quite a bit,btohqsg
And it isn't a super old car that would make it harder to find parts,btohqsg
If you were looking at something like a Chevrolet then definitely much harder because there's very few of the brand in general,btohqsg
However there are a lot of Kias on the road and they tend to have a lot of shared parts,btohqsg
Great car from what I've heard and based on the demo unit at some roadshows. The looks are a bit polarising for me but that is subjective,btohqsg
Depends on the space you want and form factor your prefer,btohqsg
Sonet  venue  arona might be slightly easier to manoeuvre as they are shorter in terms of length,btohqsg
