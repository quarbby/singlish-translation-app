Lazy people less likely to leave the house  less likely to fall sick  less likely to spend and less likely to waste. So basically a lazy person saves the most money in their lifetime,btohqsg
Bro that's not a fucking connection,btohqsg
everytime she compares RI to EJ,btohqsg
you got the point leh üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
I got the point because I'm that guy,btohqsg
"""WELL AT LEAST RI GOT MORE STUDENTS GOING INTERNATIONAL UNI. YOU ASK ANYONE GLOBALLY IN SINGAPORE WHO THEY KNOW MORE THEY CONFIRM KNOW RI MORE THAN EJ.""",btohqsg
Being friends of the Ministers kid is not a connection,btohqsg
Im not elitist but sometimes my parents make me angry  force me to fork out some elitist behaviour,btohqsg
she always pulls this shit against me,btohqsg
to say how she will be more successful in life than me,btohqsg
let her go international uni lor later she broke not ur problem,btohqsg
I will just not talk to herüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I like how gude is just hiding and laughing in the background,btohqsg
nah she will blame my parents for not spending money on her,btohqsg
i doubt she will even do well for a levels,btohqsg
but i think lodging and food need to spend $$,btohqsg
I just trust the school notes coz most of j2 i drilling and not really looking at the notesüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Food im not sure but lodging is covered,btohqsg
ngl i doubt shell get 90 also cuz idt she can get A for GP,btohqsg
like honestly she asked me read one GP essay,btohqsg
just printed for Quantum Physics today morning,btohqsg
For NUS? That one leadership position and some bs is enough,btohqsg
she literally spent the hwole of ystd,btohqsg
asking me how to do APGP,btohqsg
U know the smell of freshly printed paper?,btohqsg
okay tbf its cause shes comparing to me,btohqsg
cuz i didnt have difficulty in math,btohqsg
Just in the body instead of outside,btohqsg
Right  reply w ‚Äòi tot u think u better than me  why must i now help u‚Äô,btohqsg
so maybe thats why idg why she keeps saying shes better than me when she asks me stuff like this LOL,btohqsg
wah like that the 90rp dream= crushed,btohqsg
ystd i had to sleep at 2am,btohqsg
to help her do her MATH QNS,btohqsg
She's female. There always a backdoor,btohqsg
I also know my sis went to take Masters because she all the while from p sch to bachelor lower than me,btohqsg
I wonder how she passed the test,btohqsg
she will do better than u Kuro,btohqsg
I stop at bachelor because first class sounds nice,btohqsg
u havent touched a levels in damn long,btohqsg
then the JAE students they have the test,btohqsg
I always thought f math is harder  like it‚Äôs not exactly like a math vs e math so it‚Äôs not rly possible to have that. But then again I didn‚Äôt take f math so I could be wrong,btohqsg
she did decently for her RI exams I think (I think she got B for everything then chinese S),btohqsg
I heard now they cut down on test (not sure if standardised or sch discretion),btohqsg
im not sure how RI works,btohqsg
I actually scored higher for F Maths in J1,btohqsg
i only have two close friends from RI,btohqsg
eh lazy people are smart ppl,btohqsg
1 of them is a President Scholar  future MFA person alr got his masters,btohqsg
1 of them was my batchmate geog kiddo,btohqsg
They can cramp 12 wks worth of noted within 1 week,btohqsg
Oh u mean the fm selection test,btohqsg
I see  what do you think are possible reasons why some ppl who take f math might find f math easier than math,btohqsg
"tbf fmath is not really ""harder math""",btohqsg
Coz i was stunned by all the proving qns,btohqsg
Maths is harder when there is no context to it i feel,btohqsg
at my level  it was just less careless when it's tougherbut more careless when it's easier,btohqsg
Maths to me is always the same,btohqsg
I think its bc of complacency,btohqsg
The difference between A* and A,btohqsg
To me is i rlly got to learn why im doing this method and this step when im in uni ah,btohqsg
why is valerie just reacting to everything,btohqsg
If I recall  around 97 for J1 F Maths but 93 for C Maths,btohqsg
Like how quadratic equation can be used in almost any algebra equations,btohqsg
But when it‚Äôs tougher do you feel that you can still solve it? If yes I suppose tougher questions are better for you,btohqsg
Yeah then doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean f math is easier ah,btohqsg
cuz gude asked me for help for gp last yr,btohqsg
and i got lazy to respond,btohqsg
So my gut feeling was right lol,btohqsg
Motto of life: aim to be lazy,btohqsg
I still don‚Äôt get this joke,btohqsg
Also was this msg why Gude asked me to send the GP notes,btohqsg
If gude you see this pls tell me whether you rly think it‚Äôs better than RI notes lol,btohqsg
There is a unique emphasis on the tangibility  the solidity  the texture  the weight  the graspability of an object. The real being solid was part of a scientific attitude connected with a sense of ownership  we purchase and buy what we so desire and seek the glamour and riches of a lucky few. Everything and anything is buyable akin to a commodity  trading and bargaining in the same way we do for an apple.,btohqsg
ur sch gp notes are actually one of the better ones ive seen,btohqsg
im not sure why the distinction rate is still low,btohqsg
Ya same. But I heard from my brother than actually they do the most value add compared to other schs (like they see the students o level English grades and compare with how they perform for As  AC students were found to have the mostImprovement),btohqsg
Idk where he got the info from but should be from somewhere reliable,btohqsg
In conclusion1. all schools are good schools2. grades are not important3. vote wisely when you can. I just don't know who is wisely.,btohqsg
Like Acjc GP dist rates ranged from between 28-35% the past few years iinw,btohqsg
eh this is not bad ig,btohqsg
Not all are equal at least,btohqsg
Yeah definitely better than the national average,btohqsg
RI 2023 apparantly had a super high distinction rate but it was comparable with their AB rate,btohqsg
never said they are equal. Just all schools are good schools üòÇ,btohqsg
I rmbr seeing the 2017 stats from the Reddit post,btohqsg
I actually do have the full list  for the subjects that my school offered. These are for the 2017 batch  the first batch of the new syllabus. Don't ask me how I got it  I just very sneakily and quickly took pictures :) These are National Distinction rates btw.H1 Biology - 23.0% H1 Chemistry - 21.4% H1 CSE - 25.2% H1 Economics - 31.6% H1 ELIT - 32.7% H1 Geography - 27.6% H1 GP - 24.4% H1 History - 25.9% H1 Math - 37.0% H1 Physics - 22.2% H1 Chinese - 24.8% H1 Malay - 26.0% H1 Tamil - 26.5% H1 GSC - 41.2%H2 Art - 50.8% H2 Biology - 46.0% H2 Chemistry - 38.9% H2 Chinese- 31.7% H2 CSE - 18.4% H2 Economics - 42.3% H2 ELIT - 47.7% H2 ELL - 41.1% H2 FMATH - 42.2% H2 Geography - 37.5% H2 History - 44.6% H2 KI - 53.3% H2 Math - 51.2% H2 Malay - 34.8% H2 Music - 44.0% H2 Physics - 41.3% H2 TSD - 38.5%,btohqsg
yeah 24.4 makes sense its arnd 25,btohqsg
reminds me of my RI 2022 batch of students.They told me all of them were in the worst physics grouping. üò≠Cuz scored the lowest in sch.That's why they came to me,btohqsg
end up 100% of them As and Bs,btohqsg
Hi if I kill babies  why will the number of adults in the future decrease?,btohqsg
Tf I forgot acjc got h2 malay lit,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt actually know if ac had that,btohqsg
u dont have to study for GP,btohqsg
GP is literally a 100% skills based subject,btohqsg
I feel like it depends on luck and skills lol,btohqsg
My GP skills are moderate only,btohqsg
he came up with a method,btohqsg
to be able to circumvent like,btohqsg
Then in the end his classes had an 80% distinction rate LOL,btohqsg
I retook just GP for fun and went from C to A.Army language works better.,btohqsg
how do u study for GP,btohqsg
To what extent are sports personalities good role models for young people today?,btohqsg
i never had to study examples,btohqsg
Can briefly describe what it is,btohqsg
cuz i just randomly pull from the depths of my brain,btohqsg
because idk how to briefly explain it,btohqsg
I thought NS causes brain rot LOL,btohqsg
all my friends thought it was useless,btohqsg
it shows that brain rot needed to score for GP,btohqsg
we just follow along for the shits and giggles,btohqsg
only had 1 non A for GP,btohqsg
Like literally half the ppl in my office cuss in almost every sentence,btohqsg
They all are equal. Rather they all are separate but equal  should the resources provided proof to be and are quantatively materially identical it is of the perview of the state in which it does not violate equal and equitable protection.,btohqsg
How not to get the brain rot,btohqsg
Some of literally say CB everytime,btohqsg
Even when the officers are there,btohqsg
reasons why bedok got B for GP1. Talked about NS2. Talked like he was in NS,btohqsg
he just knows alot abt the world la,btohqsg
life will never be equal.Schools too,btohqsg
Went from D to B. Just depends on if u actual managed to draw a topic u can yap about,btohqsg
i think in general i just know alot abt the world,btohqsg
Wait since you under the OA system,btohqsg
WAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING,btohqsg
kuro can't you keep your points in one line,btohqsg
Only agnostic people know alot of things,btohqsg
reasons why Kuro cant get more than C for GP,btohqsg
one line for one point pls,btohqsg
Wait so does that mean before going to NTU you also retook a levels once,btohqsg
oh i do this all the time,btohqsg
So you basically did a levels as a private candidate twice,btohqsg
U gotta test the waters first,btohqsg
But unlike him he actually improved lol,btohqsg
I just realised my friend is retaking a levels,btohqsg
Maybe E120 still hasn‚Äôt reached his full potential,btohqsg
in the olden days where sms where all counted  and charged 5 cents per sms if u exceedAlmost no one types one or two words for one message,btohqsg
Retake one more time will get even better grades,btohqsg
YT you retake also won't get better,btohqsg
Well that is not the question being examined. More on if it is in the states power and ethical obligation to provide equivalent and equitable access to education which would provide them the same future prospects and opportunities as all.,btohqsg
sms days no class chat group,btohqsg
if i can get 90RP again,btohqsg
But the thought of doing organic chem,btohqsg
Si Yan woke up and chose facts.,btohqsg
in 2022 a levels the questions i left blank1. All the questions which involved me writing chemical equations2. Anything organic chem related,btohqsg
You need to ask your parents whether they can pay for the utility bills again so you can save money for that lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why try a new combi,btohqsg
each extra year spent is an opportunity cost,btohqsg
i knew when i took a levels in 2022 i didnt really try,btohqsg
Gude used to be lawful good,btohqsg
cause i was working during a level period,btohqsg
So i knew i dumped q alot of content away (quantum physics etc.),btohqsg
Ok ya Sekali YT proves us naysayers wrong,btohqsg
i mean i got skill gapped in some of my y1 mods,btohqsg
And I think 2022 I started paying for my friends stuff as well (he just got retrenched so he was taking money from me for 2 months),btohqsg
i just wanna do my own things,btohqsg
kuro if you don't maintain above 3.9 for the rest of poly  you treat HDL,btohqsg
ya thats why i just LEAVE the convo,btohqsg
The good thing about betting on the shit horse in a horse race is u get extremely favourable spreads,btohqsg
Ok. Cambridge will thank you for the $600,btohqsg
The Private Candidates‚Äô Registration Exercise for the 2024 Singapore-Cambridge GCE N(T)/N(A)-  O- and A-Level examinations takes place from 4 April to 17 April 2024. Please visit SEAB‚Äôs website atwww.seab.gov.sgfor more details.https://www.facebook.com/share/p/35CM9MHJuFe9zvcz/?mibextid=oFDknk,btohqsg
its what happened to me in chs also anyways,btohqsg
just had hdl today at seletar mall,btohqsg
if i were to ever retake,btohqsg
my fam ordered a fuck ton of korean fried chicken,btohqsg
i would take1. H2 Geog2. H2 Lit3. H2 Math4. H1 Econs,btohqsg
What I am merely saying that black Swan events do still happen,btohqsg
he literally texted me a few days ago,btohqsg
Like it's still possible just rare and if u win u win big,btohqsg
I think you‚Äôd still easily get 90rp,btohqsg
If I do just h2 Econs,btohqsg
And h1 history if I need reapply,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to retake everything,btohqsg
I doubt I can get A for h2 math and GP again,btohqsg
H2 math brain rot alr cos so long never touch,btohqsg
where all my NS pay goes to,btohqsg
When he promises to pay you back  does he always do so?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs more important he keeps his promises,btohqsg
i feel bad cuz i been to his house before,btohqsg
Like 1 room rental flat kind ah,btohqsg
cuz he stays with his mum,btohqsg
Bro I mean it's not like I had a say or choice lmao but u just adapt and move on,btohqsg
but his pay isnt alot so,btohqsg
and if he cant pay back then wtv,btohqsg
Is it like those old type with a super narrow corridor and the doors facing both sides,btohqsg
Such a young age alr have to shoulder a lot,btohqsg
Newer rental flats look better at least,btohqsg
I was thinking he‚Äôs the same age as you,btohqsg
which is why i can kinda empathise,btohqsg
See the good thing about unsecured short term debt is that u get a high interest rate,btohqsg
Ok but not so bad if he‚Äôs post ord,btohqsg
for someone elses long term happiness,btohqsg
I thought he surviving on ns pay,btohqsg
ya but he just moved in,btohqsg
and apparantly his rental is q ex,btohqsg
It's just isit worth or good enough to do so.,btohqsg
i dont eat for one day = someone else can get like a better place to sleep,btohqsg
Then it‚Äôs not govt rental flat I guess,btohqsg
/someonecan get a better quality of living,btohqsg
I was thinking about those highly subsidised govt rental flats,btohqsg
Those ones the condition is generally quite terrible,btohqsg
so he had to go get a proper like,btohqsg
Rly nice of you I guess,btohqsg
The financial markets are a fun place to look at lmao the market for distressed assets is a massive thing,btohqsg
i think the gov didnt let him get,btohqsg
so he had to get his own one,btohqsg
its also why his pay is damn low cuz,btohqsg
not really a lot of companies want mah,btohqsg
but hes just a rly good friend of mine,btohqsg
if some random person from this grp chat ask me for money,btohqsg
Ok that must be rly traumatic,btohqsg
By family members or random ppl,btohqsg
u can go suffer in torment and torture,btohqsg
Oh god were they ever caught,btohqsg
I mean if it‚Äôs not been reported probably still can,btohqsg
This sort of thing needs closure,btohqsg
so Singapore has this like rule where you cannot report sexual assault pass a certain timeframe i think,btohqsg
"its like the ""window period thingy""",btohqsg
Probably should continue appealing to the MP,btohqsg
U mean a statue of limitations?,btohqsg
its just what i heard from my lawyer friends,btohqsg
most countries are actually like that,btohqsg
thats why when finland (or sweden) had the like window rule,btohqsg
Now she‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs probably someone else I guess?,btohqsg
But before RK came in  it should‚Äôve been a pap mp,btohqsg
"Cuz in finland or sweden rite  they have this ""windows always open"" thing? So theres no window period for sexual assault",btohqsg
its like lets say u got assaulted in 2017  and the window period is 3 years. If you report it in 2021 only  the case wont go through,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs still worth a try if he knows the perpetratos by name,btohqsg
For claims yes. But this is very much dependent on the crime,btohqsg
whether it was opened before or not doesn't matter with statute of limitations,btohqsg
It‚Äôs legit sickening child sexual abuse goes unpunished,btohqsg
Bro SA isn't even a legal term,btohqsg
If its a minor there is no statue of limitations,btohqsg
There are like hundreds of exceptions,btohqsg
But depends this only applies to sexual cases,btohqsg
Like among the remaining 3 members He Ting Ru Louis Chua and Jamus Lim should be one of them,btohqsg
what is statute of limitations LOL,btohqsg
it's just the time period after the event that a case can be initiated,btohqsg
If he doesn‚Äôt mind can confide in one of them about his issues (the unreported sexual assault  need for a actual govt rental flat and not market one),btohqsg
limitation periods for sg only applies for non-criminal cases,btohqsg
They wouldn‚Äôt just brush aside his concerns else they are bad MPs,btohqsg
Ya maybe your lawyer friends were thinking about other countries,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not too late for your friend to report it,btohqsg
Criminal cases fall under the CPC,btohqsg
And CPC is another can of worms,btohqsg
i first learned about statute of limitations from phoenix wright lol,btohqsg
The police have the discretion to but often there's like a MHA guideline,btohqsg
Yeah maybe I follow pritiam Singh lor,btohqsg
the cher molested 13 kids with over 20+ counts,btohqsg
but only got jailed 2.5 years,btohqsg
If not maybe just write to the MP to appeal for govt rental flat,btohqsg
Thats why I just go in Undergrad first,btohqsg
"Reason:""made a severe lapse in judgement""",btohqsg
You talking about the IJC music?,btohqsg
Police need to whoop his ass nonstop,btohqsg
its cause the cher had a wife,btohqsg
Like he should be given maximum caning,btohqsg
so maybe the judge thought like,btohqsg
so why would he touch male kids!!!,btohqsg
Wait till u see the 17th year old kid who got his 15 year old gf pregnant and then they aborted it using a clothes hanger,btohqsg
Actually Singapore should legalise chemical castration too imo,btohqsg
Some of them too horny and lack self control,btohqsg
this sounds like my friends sister,btohqsg
Singapore should legalise trial by combat,btohqsg
make them fight to the death,btohqsg
Teen found guilty of impregnating 15-year-old girlfriend  instigating her to bury stillborn babyhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/teen-found-guilty-of-impregnating-15-year-old-girlfriend-instigating-her-to-bury-stillborn-foetus,btohqsg
1. Can bring about entertainment = we can make more money2. Settle disputs easily3. Makes NS more important cause BCCT is the best4. Establishes gender equity,btohqsg
some may argue that trial by combat may not be a strong deterrent and hence  ineffective as a law,btohqsg
This is the one where the kid seems to be from some IPJC,btohqsg
It actually was an real court request before lmaohttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2020/01/13/iowa-courts-david-ostrom-requests-trial-combat-swords-settle-dispute/4456079002/,btohqsg
Y3 the boy fks his girl classmate,btohqsg
Then his lawyers say he has good results and a bright future hence should be given more lenient sentence,btohqsg
The boy gets in trouble even tho they both minors,btohqsg
i heard of this case before,btohqsg
But I wonder what JC tho,btohqsg
i rmbr i heard that there was a case like this,btohqsg
but maybe its a diff one,btohqsg
my source is my memory so its quite inaccurate,btohqsg
Also pls do ask him to consider,btohqsg
If no closure it might haunt him for the rest of his life,btohqsg
He alr came to terms with it,btohqsg
Hi if I kill babies  why will the number of adults in the future decrease?,btohqsg
The perpetrator could still be out there assaulting others tho,btohqsg
If the victims also can‚Äôt take it upon themselves to report who will,btohqsg
I just feel that they need to be brought to task,btohqsg
What do you want me to do,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like me asking  if I kill all the unemployed people  why does the number of unemployed people fall?,btohqsg
hey  hey  haven't taken History or Econs in JC and got a B average for GP  how screwed am I for an IR or Politics and Econs degree?,btohqsg
my teacher in pri sch transferred from this boys sch to my sch cause the parents too keesiao,btohqsg
The 4 of them split themselves to cover her ward,btohqsg
I think it could be just selecting 1 of the 4 of them,btohqsg
this is so dumb but im considering taking random alevels after my actual alvls just for fun,btohqsg
im not really interested in physics but i actl kinda wanna take h1 phys in the future just for shits and giggles,btohqsg
or become like yt and collect all the alvls,btohqsg
ALSO WHY DOES IT TAKE 4H TO LOAD THIS EDITOR,btohqsg
wow does it take long to load,btohqsg
is there some palestine poster again,btohqsg
am otw to a math tuition rn,btohqsg
i havent done math in years,btohqsg
yea cause ian is anti palestine,btohqsg
send the qn in the study chats,btohqsg
ok if i need i send yall,btohqsg
Yikes my gpa came out and it‚Äôs not the best,btohqsg
Why tho NTU got nothing one :(,btohqsg
Be like that guy who retook his o lvls just for fun,btohqsg
Imagine spending 4 years learning about friction ratios u join boeing who then proceeds to ignore what u say,btohqsg
if i take olvls when im older it'd not be retaking but taking for the first time,btohqsg
my sec 4 fren from concer band gonna step down after ndp perf,btohqsg
Oh u mean u teach tuition ah,btohqsg
Me dumb head thought why u need tuition,btohqsg
huh u thought i was sec 2,btohqsg
No ik u ord rdy but in my mind i was like why u need tuition when u pass o and a lvl rdy,btohqsg
pretends to care about people when shes just another sjw idiot with a rich daddy crying about the struggles of the poor and oppressed from her landed property and $18000 red wine,btohqsg
Tbh idk what happen but its fun to read about tea,btohqsg
i mean i know some people like that,btohqsg
so quick to call people out for being misogynistic but fail to recognise their own misandry,btohqsg
and like to say they‚Äôre a feminist,btohqsg
and then they pull the ‚Äúmisogyny kills misandry annoys‚Äù,btohqsg
which has to be one of the dumbest possible arguments ever,btohqsg
feminist logic is intenally valid in their own little bubble but def are not sound arguments,btohqsg
those are the kind of people that make people think feminism as even more of a joke,btohqsg
I too lazy to watch finish the video  scroll to the end to hear her say ‚Äúfeel free to call me slut‚Äù,btohqsg
like i‚Äôm ok with certain things in principle but a lot of them lack the ability to analyse situations objectively,btohqsg
The video feels like she write a gp essay and read it out,btohqsg
i forgot about my bio deadline,btohqsg
Its feels like she making words up to sound more deep,btohqsg
Maybe its just my english cmi lol,btohqsg
wow so funny!! i was laughing my ass off and i accidentally dropped a bomb that was in my pocket,btohqsg
will i tear my eyes out,btohqsg
She just described how she got slut shamed in jc and people still slut shame her in uni den blame it on guys coz guy can slut shame girls but girls cannot slut shame guys. Somewhere along the lines,btohqsg
ok then dont be a slut?????,btohqsg
I see her on ntu subreddit but idk who is she,btohqsg
I think is best if we both justcontinue to dk,btohqsg
Next topic. So what happen to yall and flower ah,btohqsg
Cause according to r shes crazy or smth,btohqsg
she is dealing with her irl issues,btohqsg
or maybe my friend is just wholesome,btohqsg
i just entered and saw sex form,btohqsg
wait@kohsyanwas royston han alr in dhs at ur time,btohqsg
Bro why isit 120 of the same stickers,btohqsg
ok i definitely do not support rose getting bullied...but sometimes she needs to understand that she has to change her attitude when talking to people,btohqsg
cos her tone pisses off some ppl,btohqsg
Why is there 120 sticker of the same image,btohqsg
wait did she leave this gc alr,btohqsg
Wait are you saying. a possible reason she got bullied irl is because of the way she talks to ppl ?,btohqsg
"she literally told me ""you took history for Os but you still can't remember these events sia""",btohqsg
I think she was trying to joke with you but then it came across as insensitive,btohqsg
Don't even need to remember lol,btohqsg
there's a diff between joking and outright flaming people,btohqsg
I didn't remember shit for History it's just recognising the flow and the contextual stage,btohqsg
Im not gonna comment cause idk how she acts irl and idont think bullying is really justified in any situation,btohqsg
yeah but im just saying this might be a possible reason on why she gets bullied,btohqsg
I don't even remember the secret soviet german treaty lol I just remember it as the Molotov Ribbentrop treaty,btohqsg
I mean yea cause my friends and i say p offensive stuff to each other but we both know we are joking then maybe you guys arent close enough for her to make such jokes,btohqsg
yes i know your pt lol,btohqsg
but she was literally spamming it in the chat,btohqsg
Have you tried telling her that its not nice,btohqsg
Maybe next time you can tell her to stop directly,btohqsg
I think it was when she just join back,btohqsg
i didn't want to talk to her alr,btohqsg
But ok la she got turn it off after people tell her not to do it,btohqsg
ya i find her more chill now,btohqsg
Oh js curious is neko luna very active in the solidarity in struggle discord server,btohqsg
i think empathy is -ev too,btohqsg
unless its someone u rly care for personally,btohqsg
i mean empathy is ok up to the point it takes a toll on you,btohqsg
u have a limited amount of emotional capacity,btohqsg
I miss the fucked up Internet humour of the early 2000s,btohqsg
why waste it on someone udk,btohqsg
you can empathise without getting invested imo,btohqsg
"""oil up gga im coming in 10 mins to touch you""",btohqsg
like i will empathise with your shit but it doesn‚Äôt mean i‚Äôll make it my problem,btohqsg
and people need to stop getting coddled,btohqsg
ya true most people suck at setting boundaries,btohqsg
if you can‚Äôt set boundaries then don‚Äôt get involved,btohqsg
Or just don't give a shit and come in guns blazing,btohqsg
for people i really care about i‚Äôm ok with coddling when they need it but even then there‚Äôs a limit ma,btohqsg
even if it‚Äôs my partner i‚Äôm gonna get drained af if i gotta coddle them 24/7,btohqsg
There is only this much fuck i can give everyday,btohqsg
Gotta follow the asepa spiritOh-oh  I got better things to do with my timeBetter things to do with my time  do with my time,btohqsg
for me is if i care about u ill counsel u and care about u but fuck everyone else,btohqsg
most people dont even deserve empathy,btohqsg
If u wan empathy and trauma dump that's what UCC is for,btohqsg
so i rather focus my limited capacity on my friend who is sad and has a problem,btohqsg
than someone dying halfway across the world,btohqsg
Bro I can listen but I can tell u my advise is this is your problem,btohqsg
like u got so much mental and emotional capacity meh,btohqsg
u nth better to do ah,btohqsg
sympathy is usually very uncalled for like you think they deserve pity which is kinda judging them,btohqsg
and u cant even help them so u so sad for palestine for what,btohqsg
Honestly why do ppl want pity?,btohqsg
It's like begging why tf would one wish to guilt someone into that,btohqsg
i mean even for my friends  sometimes i gotta set my boundaries so they don‚Äôt start relying on me as a trauma dump,btohqsg
only for when they‚Äôre in bad spots kinda thing,btohqsg
What 2NA math topic are u gonna teach tho,btohqsg
go all in for every hand,btohqsg
idk what to make for lunch,btohqsg
Theres literally nothing in the fridge,btohqsg
idk if i can say which specific organisation here but i got accepted to smth i really wanted üòÜ,btohqsg
i thought i was rejected but i checked my email today andüòÜ,btohqsg
empathy isn‚Äôt one singular thing. it‚Äôs a spectrum,btohqsg
It takes a lot of courage to even apply for it and go through trials to get into something you wanted,btohqsg
"Idk man  personally imo ig it never hurts to empathize like idek if it's an act of selfless and/or reckless behaviour but  I see ""taking a toll on you"" doesn't necessarily mean its bad bad",btohqsg
depends on whether the person is worth it,btohqsg
bro suddenly switch to learning psychology,btohqsg
So r u saying it's subjective to a certain extent,btohqsg
Like how being autistic has its own spectrum or wot,btohqsg
i just mean that just bc i‚Äôm being empathetic doesn‚Äôt mean im committing to helping,btohqsg
it can be as simple as i see why you‚Äôd feel that way,btohqsg
but bedok gonna be lance soon,btohqsg
why u not promoted like him ah,btohqsg
Isn't that most if not  almost everyone on earth or am I generalizing,btohqsg
nah some people can‚Äôt do it LOL like if you‚Äôre set in thinking a certain way,btohqsg
Is your promotion still being delayed,btohqsg
no la i see what bro needs help with then i help lor,btohqsg
But would you help me in my quest for finding empathy in the general public,btohqsg
"like at most they give u ""hardass trigo qns""",btohqsg
No need to tell me la ngl that's between you and UCC,btohqsg
