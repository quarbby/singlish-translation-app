bro where did you get that info from,btohqsg
it's still a massive problem all across state elections,btohqsg
But then note that vox news is supporting democratic party,btohqsg
So the way they reported it might be biased,btohqsg
history SBQ 101: all sources are biased  but you still have to explain how this bias affects their analysis,btohqsg
So take the news with a grain of salt...  especially deepfaking AI is on the rise,btohqsg
vox is generally speaking a pretty factual source (media bias fact check ground news ad fontes)  though yes they do lean left,btohqsg
"like ""beware of deepfaked videos and fake news"" is valid advice  but saying take a very factual news source with ""a pinch of salt"" because there's deepfaked news is like",btohqsg
"""it rained this morning  beware of earthquakes while you're out""",btohqsg
"""the sun is very hot  murder is illegal""",btohqsg
Depends on type of news haha,btohqsg
If the news is factual like natural disaster warning  it can be trusted,btohqsg
But political  nope   the US has issues with how their media outlets report stuff 😅😅,btohqsg
"the implication that there's a connection between ""vox news is left-leaning and pretty factually accurate"" and ""deepfaked news is on the rise and you should be careful"" either implies that you're anyhowly hedging your bets and warning people to be cautious  or you think vox news is on the same level as fake news",btohqsg
like real quick  have you taken history/GP?,btohqsg
push for people to read and discern themselves not just take with a grain of salt,btohqsg
Yup   that's what I trying to mean haha   someone got my words,btohqsg
your words and intentions don’t line up,btohqsg
I know USA has ground news too so,btohqsg
like for an example of a genuinely bad example of a news outlet  New York Post is full of sensationalized news stories (MBFC),btohqsg
ground news isn't a news outlet hahaha,btohqsg
it collects news stories and shows multiple outlets at once,btohqsg
They warn of potential bias of political news even though they not news outlets,btohqsg
I watched vox video many times before so i know they lean Democrat,btohqsg
But then vox seem to employ good video editors team .... their video is well edited ...,btohqsg
With deepfaking on the rise   ppl have also been scammed by AI generated content. Can already imagine if unscrupulous news outlets use it to fake information during election day 😂😂😂,btohqsg
U all no watch what triump is trying to do?  He's trying to make 🇺🇸 go bust,btohqsg
Some china people commented his way is brilliant 👏,btohqsg
🇺🇸 is heading for bust anyway,btohqsg
why do people believe in deep fake videos?,btohqsg
some deepfakes are really really realistic,btohqsg
its a big problem in NC,btohqsg
But if usa fall..sg also fall,btohqsg
a lot of people believe that Zelenskyy slaps Trump ...,btohqsg
even though that is 100% fake,btohqsg
That's why I not putting videos of myself online 😅😅,btohqsg
but being on social media already leak private stuff?,btohqsg
I have practically no presence on social media these days,btohqsg
I dun post selfie online like others,btohqsg
Instagram account I used to have but to post stray animal photo 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Deleted long ago too 😂😂😂 so hmm ...,btohqsg
Just be careful with what you want to share online and know video can be manipulated,btohqsg
Ahhh I dun have selfie on profile photo on telegram,btohqsg
I am sure the cat won't mind getting deepfaked 👍👍😅 (okay cats can't object to being deepfaked anyway),btohqsg
But it gets attention from the community   food and water are provided to the cat practically everyday   so yeah ... including a nearby school's staff who already have cats in her house,btohqsg
If I reveal the school I will effectively reveal where I live haha so .... not revealing it but the cat gave birth to 5 kittens in 2 separate occasions,btohqsg
oh i thought its where you work or study,btohqsg
Haha cats picture from a photography standpoint is difficult to take,btohqsg
I deem this photo suitable for sharing   no blurr or problems .... this is a shot taken by random chance,btohqsg
I mostly play on probability when taking cat photography   the more I take  the more expected number of photo of good quality I take,btohqsg
