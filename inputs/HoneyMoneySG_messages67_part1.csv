Hi  does it make sense to pair amaze with Citibank cashback card for overseas travel spending?,btohqsg
Interest probably mainly depends on whats gg on w the macro environment?Think extra 25k isnt too much for the govt considering inflation,btohqsg
yes for overseas dining  groceries and petrol,btohqsg
It is also partially dependent on the amount of sdic premium that banks banks have to contribute,btohqsg
uh  u talking about citi cashback card right? only 0.25% cashback for shopping  not even enough to cover markup for Amaze.,btohqsg
Shopping with amaze+CRMC? Depends where u shop  imo,btohqsg
So it is still better to pair amaze with crmc,btohqsg
depends u prefer 10xpoints (4mpd) or 6-8% cashback on dining/groceries/petrol. Can always switch which card to link to Amaze also.,btohqsg
