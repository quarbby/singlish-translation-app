They make news sometime ago then many ppl rushed in and after that no more queue. So share all stuck inside,btohqsg
Thanks for the analysis  I agree with you too... Doesn't make sense for thaibev to be at tt price... Bbs just playing w the price to collect more at the low.... I feel that this stock is less on chart reading but rather  to know what the bb wants... Too much manipulation,btohqsg
Good growing profitable companies will draw investors  there are buyers but they are not showing you when they are buying   always waiting for moments when sellers give up good stock at cheap price,btohqsg
They announced RTO sometime ago but now seems like RTO not materializing,btohqsg
Hi allWonder if any kind soul here can share this article?https://www.theedgesingapore.com/capital/sgx-research-series-10-10/revez-corp-eyes-5g-extended-reality-and-digitalisation-drive,btohqsg
BB not gonna care 0.565 vs 0.58. too insignificant also. I think they want lower.,btohqsg
I cannot access cos didn’t subscribe to it.,btohqsg
Thaibev is one of the most shorted stocks on SGX,btohqsg
Agree with u. Medtec has become a stock where very few new investors dare to buy in. It’s the precious batch investors challenging the BBs in the price war.,btohqsg
Can definitely see they want to get it at lower price than 0.565. But very few panic sellers now I guess.,btohqsg
MedtecsSeriously I learn something new in the market everyday. This stock shows how immature and childish most of its players are (I don’t even want to taint the word investor)A stock that done 3000% year to date (estimate) is by no means underperforming or no value recognition by market. From a paltry 4 cent to 1.98 high it’s almost 50XAll I see are plenty of hounding to the IR asking them to help long term investors.What’s there to help? A company is everlasting by theory why should it be bothered with share price actually? Especially when they are making good money and with access to credit facilities they have no need for capital market.So-called long term investors whine at the share price and complain of manipulation. Don’t see anyone complain it is being manipulated to 50X returns? How long term exactly are u?You bought in a sexy theme and want long term returns in the shortest time possible and when it is not happening you complain and whine and scold management  exchange  bb and anything elseExcept yourselfEnd of the day you are the greedy shit who chased and got caught at high (no self blame) and want the long term multibagging returns in shortest time possible. Nothing wrong wanting big returns  that’s everybody’s aim in the market but the whining makes you a class below the rest. Or none.Everyday say TG better  tan sri support price blah blahGo buy TG la!!!! Ironic when you claim this girl can be the best wife and you decide to go for the spitfire instead and compare on a daily basis.Only your own life ends up miserable. But nope u decide to spread the negativity but it breeds and multiplies  it doesn’t get any lesser for ownself,btohqsg
You decide to buy the stock and make ownself miserable by whining daily.Cut and move onLike a timely divorce. Good for all parties if things not working out,btohqsg
Always amazed with bro furion posts.Haha,btohqsg
How? Can I fwd to mt chat? Got copyright or not,btohqsg
MT chat should be all long term holders right?People will whine meh,btohqsg
Many whine..I told them dont keep kar jiao mt... gana niao back,btohqsg
Then can't consider them LT holders loh.Normally those whining should be those short term trading one ba inclusive of myself haha,btohqsg
Always?I thought u just entered ytd?,btohqsg
Go ahead. But Kanna kick out don’t blame me,btohqsg
Yup your first lost I read and I am already amazed,btohqsg
Gek gek till very real haha,btohqsg
All hate to admit they are punters. Hide under pretext of investors look more righteous to kpkb,btohqsg
End up just some who can’t bear admitting they are wrong,btohqsg
it's normal n ok to grumble when lost money... but mt is abit too much...It's like a kid score 99 marks on exam n gana whack by parent for not scoring 120... against a paper that's 100 full mark,btohqsg
Handsome yang went from being called handsome in Aug to being asked to resign now,btohqsg
Buy a ppe stock few months all become ppe experts on how to run the business,btohqsg
It's not only MT la I can name a few stocks hereThe problem is there are a few people actively promoting it when it's on a bull runWhen it can't substain it's bull run and drop back they console people saying it will ride back up with its undervalue etcWhen it didn't you will end up a bunch of people whining loh,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think there is anything wrong pointing out stuff when other companies are doing it asking MT to do the same.What is longterm and what is short term is based on one's own investment horizon isn't it?It is a little uncalled for to call shit and get aggressive. It is your opinion vs someone else's opinion.,btohqsg
Isn’t gem one of those who keep screaming medtec to buy daily,btohqsg
I cut loss and posted here,btohqsg
“ problem is there are people who keep promoting it while it is on a bull”,btohqsg
I bought 1.6 and 192 and 194,btohqsg
U r one of them or the loudest lol,btohqsg
You can't cut loss then blame me?Lol,btohqsg
At least she bought and cut loss and openly says it lol,btohqsg
Nothing wrong to shout  that’s like cheering,btohqsg
Better than the guy who bought it and curse the stocks to go down,btohqsg
Ah yes..Mr Lee is a good supporter of MT... we need more supporters like u.I think it's not calling shit la.. it's giving another perspective to MT holders..buy n believe in company...dont expect 1 week wonder...Already up alot le...still expect $1.2 to $2 within 1 week? It's like losing weight ma...at first easy to drop...after that harder to drop...MT seems to do well this week...despite the drop after Q3....hopefully reach new lows of 130 series...slowly building a stronger foundation...Be peaceful and let mgmt do their work,btohqsg
Don’t know he really got buy or didn’t buy lol,btohqsg
And I realize my mistake since that bull run from 1 to 198,btohqsg
And I never chase again when it's kinda high again.So picking on my calls thats so long ago you must remember me deep deep hahaha,btohqsg
Actually mt really good.... can play long can short.... really not boring n got chance to earn every day...Too bad I dun dare short...not familiar with it,btohqsg
The problem is that most people don't have SL,btohqsg
Key sentence is chance to earn means you can lose also,btohqsg
Yes... including me...Is it true if 1 short a stock  n the stock gana halted before u cover..... u need to pay everyday that it's halted?,btohqsg
I have no intention to insult medtecs investors. If offended  I apologiseMy point is that everyone want their stocks share price to rise  no matter how good or bad the stock is. Liongold shareholders also want to see a replica of past performance. Realistic or not is another issue.We all buy and pray on hope. Nothing sinful about thatIssue arises when it gets negative. And spreading of negativity. Medtecs is just a prime example. Plentiful of examples to go around but it’s the most symbolic recently.By all means I don’t think medtecs is a bad company. I do think it’s undervalued and the earnings power is underestimated by the market. PE less than 5However instead of thinking it is the market fault  I ponder further why market will give such a low PE instead.Ideas I thought Of:Low NAV. Which means the ROA is sky high. Sustainability of such ROA is a big question mark which market gives a big discount forEarnings power. Back to same word: sustainability. All the players are shouting is next 1-2Q. So what’s after that? Of course the usual story about how COVID is here to stay  how the vaccine is not easily created and even if created  dissemination and production is an issue. Medical field has changed  the demand for gloves and ppe will never go back to pre-COVID era  injection of vaccine also need ppe blah blahI supposed I gave a good summary on the pro-medtecs argument alreadyOne can’t help but admit regardless  this is the peak earnings period for medtecs. Maybe next 1-2Q form new record but nope the sky is not the limit. Earnings will plateau and the forward earnings will reduce  the market will adjust and punish accordingly. If u think it won’t happen  read up on tulip mania. So many examples in history and all used the same termThis time is differentPlayers won’t think so far because they aren’t investors they just want to make a quick buck. Problem is when their quick buck plan failed is whole world’s fault except theirs. Which probably speaks volume on their attitude in life. Not a concern not a problem. Something they have to live with and hopefully ponder upon for self-reflection,btohqsg
Got to ask people that short le,btohqsg
People are too in love w the stock,btohqsg
MT is the best trading stock in SGX  else very boring,btohqsg
Most of the stocks can’t really move,btohqsg
