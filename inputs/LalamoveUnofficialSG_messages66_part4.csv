Where got $15. I see all $6-8 only HHAHA,btohqsg
One thing good is pick up 10am. Before 6 drop off can Liao,btohqsg
Will have $10-$15 if they want pick up and deliver now. But this one is mostly between 10am-6pm. So the fare not so high,btohqsg
More like parcel. Parcel price no good,btohqsg
Who say . Suay suay take one covid passenger. Your whole family need to quarantine... ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Ya lor. I only did once. Used it as how I use hitch,btohqsg
Okok  I go sign try try  haaha,btohqsg
This can stack order and send any time is it?,btohqsg
Some between 10-1. Some 10-6. Depending on the customer r,btohqsg
Longer the time frame. The cheaper it is,btohqsg
So can stack as many order as we can as long as we send within the time frame??,btohqsg
Some have advanced booking. Like today 2 July. Some 3rd July order. But AJ is damn Low. Like $4 bucks from Bedok to yishun,btohqsg
You can stack 10 if you want and send within time frame,btohqsg
But you go pick up 10 places also tiring,btohqsg
Got take from 1 place n send to many address. Or all door to door 1 parcel,btohqsg
long time frame jobs exclude on-demand food delivery  which is where the volume is.,btohqsg
Like that time consuming n tiring for peanuts,btohqsg
Unless heng Heng they have 3 parcel lor. From what I checked  seldom have. Nearby have. But same place more than 1 parcel donâ€™t have,btohqsg
Rather u take hitch sua go the place u want,btohqsg
Sometimes on the way I pick one parcel up then go to the place I want lor. $7.5. Better than nothing. Use it as a hitch at least wonâ€™t go overthink so much,btohqsg
Better than hitch . At least u won't get quarantined fetching the parcelðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yah. Usually small item la. Contact lens etc. Those people online shopping kind of parcel,btohqsg
If tiao kang need go diff places pick up then is bohua,btohqsg
+1. That was why I stopped driving PHV since CB. After I sold my car  I shared rental with a FT driver.,btohqsg
If Iâ€™m going Yishun I open and check to see have parcel going Yishun or not. Have have. Donâ€™t have nvm.,btohqsg
Ya lor . Wait if got children cannot go school Dio quarantined jialat. å®³æ­»å…¨å®¶ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Anyway did a few viamove. Personally find it bohua. 40-45 mins for pick up and drop off. Less than $10,btohqsg
Donâ€™t say stack la. Per order like that do not worth,btohqsg
Unless if the customer order is consistent take all his parcel and deliver. Under table hehe,btohqsg
