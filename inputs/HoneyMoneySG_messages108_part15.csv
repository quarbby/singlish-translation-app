feasible cashback cards linked to amaze are:1. citibank cashback master2. maybank fnf,btohqsg
Can understand why only these 2? Coz of the higher cashback rate?,btohqsg
yeah these are the 2 highest cashback mastercards i am aware of,btohqsg
(dbs mastercards cannot be linked to amaze as it disqualifies them from earning rebates),btohqsg
Hi bros and sisters.Would like to check. How to know how much uob $ is at ladies credit card  if I have total of about 25 300,btohqsg
Because I not intended to transfer all to kris flyer account  as I surrender the uob preferred visa card,btohqsg
i read your question 5 times i have no idea what u are asking,btohqsg
i assume he is asking as he has ladyâ€™s and ppv  since the points pool  if he were to cancel the ppv would he get to keep the full uni$ he currently has,btohqsg
As UNI$ (NOT UOB$) is pooled  it doesn't matter if you cancel an existing miles card  as long as you still have AT LEAST ONE UNI$ (miles) card left  you will still have access to all the pooled UNI$,btohqsg
As you know uob cards can be pooled. I want to make sure points earn from uob preferred card is fully transfer to kris flyer miles before I cancel the card. And also not take away the points earn from uob ladys credit card.,btohqsg
your first sentence is inconsistent with the body of your paragraphyou have already correctly said uob cards are pooled.so whatever miles your UOB PPV and UOB Lady earned is all in ONE SAME POOL. It is not allocated to any card.,btohqsg
That's why I checked with you guys how to checked how many points are exist at uob ladies card now. As now the pdf statement show pooled uob $ points,btohqsg
whatever miles your UOB PPV and UOB Lady earned is all in ONE SAME POOL. It is not allocated to any card.,btohqsg
What they are saying is it does not matter if u cancel pvv the point stay in the pool,btohqsg
So if I transfer 25k to kris flyer. Then 300 remaining uob $ points remain with uob lady card right,btohqsg
Hi what can i do if my wise physical card lost?,btohqsg
Can i use the app to make transaction? do wise accept samsung pay  gpay?,btohqsg
no.. the remaining UNI$ remains with UOB (not assigned to any card),btohqsg
Ask them issue a new one?,btohqsg
You should probably block it and get new one right,btohqsg
Anyone know the mcc code for uob car loan?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think loans or PIP qualify for any rewards,btohqsg
Swimming pool same pool not? ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I think your priorities a bit wrong ah? You should be blocking and requesting for replacement... Then use digital card for time being... Or even better  use digital card where possible lol.,btohqsg
Bro. How you lost the wise card..,btohqsg
Maybe he dropped inside the pool,btohqsg
One card only so no multiple pool,btohqsg
IQ drop into pool also.. but don't know which pool,btohqsg
Haha don't worry  not talking about you. Talking about swimming pools,btohqsg
Misplaced while youre overseas  many reasons. If theft  of course. Freeze it.,btohqsg
Very common to lose things. You lose your wise card  others lose brain cells. ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
So to whom who dont know  not all country accept 6 digit pin  some accept 4 pins  for e.g wise. And knowing you have loaded your money to wise  you can use digital card  from the app itself or google pay?,btohqsg
Use Google Pay need to key pin on terminal? For YouTrip I know the only time I key pin is using physical card to withdraw from ATM.,btohqsg
Moomoo retroactively amended the TnCs of the promo - if youâ€™re in it now you have to maintain the net deposit assets in moomoo til 16/07/2024 or you wonâ€™t get your cash coupon ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Event ends on the 01/07 and no stipulation to retain assets within moomoo after your 20/40/60 event period,btohqsg
Quite poor form to revise T&C retroactively and lengthen the maintenance period without explicit notice to those affected.,btohqsg
RIP to those who already withdrew,btohqsg
Use CRMC for shopee/Lazada/Tabao purchase can get 10x points?,btohqsg
https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_728?_ftsdk=92e7357912cf6e0d&clientver=14.16.15808You can also access it from the promotions tab in the app,btohqsg
I know it works on gpay  apple pay. Not sure about samsung pay  dont have samsung phone,btohqsg
I also read the tnc again just now. Didnt see any terms that say need to lock in till 16th july. No matter how i read  it just says need to hold 60 days at most from the first day u subscribe.I am puzzled by your comment alsoðŸ˜…Care to enlighten exactly which clause?,btohqsg
Same  I also can't find need to lock in till 16th July,btohqsg
FAQ point 13 (was revised yesterday):During the event period (1/4/2024. 10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  please maintain the net deposit asset in account (any asset type including stocks/ funds/ cash etc). Otherwise the reward eligibility may not be fulfilled even if you have completed the holding period of 20/40/60 day.,btohqsg
Hi all. Would like to seek which miles credit card would be best to pair with cardup for income tax if the monthly instalment is more than 1k? Thanks.,btohqsg
Depend on what card u hold  those with the most base mile would be good. Like uob privi 1.4 mpd  dbs vantage 1.5 mpd  dbs altitutde 1.3 mpd,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s a nice income. Can qualify for most cards  including vantage,btohqsg
For UOB PRVI  there is no cap to the miles I can earn per month right? Not sure whether I read it correctly from online..,btohqsg
Yes no cap for base miles,btohqsg
Why now then you ask about tax. The deadline for personal tax is April 18,btohqsg
Iâ€™m going to use Amaze + CRMC and UOB Ladyâ€™s Solitaire.Then use HSBC Revol for miscellaneous spendings.Intend to pair cardup with UOB PRVI for income tax  mortgage and car loans.Hope this plan is a good one to earn miles.,btohqsg
