9000 bpo is very low by international std,btohqsg
And they consistently having lower month to month production even after adjusting for the planned shutdowns,btohqsg
They pattern a lot. Good oil days don't produce,btohqsg
Maybe they can't dig any oil,btohqsg
Oman block promise so much  but after Yuma find years back  no major discoveries,btohqsg

Indo news right....I don't bother to check,btohqsg

Digilife tech ti ti ki.. Hahaha,btohqsg

Digilife Tech $2.75 +3.774% was a SG🇸🇬-based company.. business r ICT  ISP  BEV etc... strong double bottom rebound🪃 appears W pattern in wkly📈,btohqsg
Nio gap up or down are more a norm due to trading in different time zones,btohqsg
Ya👍.. gd for traders always hv approx. +15 - 20% gains swing trade opportunity😜,btohqsg
TA aside  Nio mgt also cannot be trusted....almost always give nice forward sales target  but under achieve later,btohqsg
LI's mgt better. Very quiet but nice sales increased,btohqsg
But then  Li sp also same  very dull,btohqsg
LI cars are selling quite well,btohqsg
I've seen more of them lately,btohqsg
But of course BYD is the champ,btohqsg
The key here is until now LI has been selling hybrids,btohqsg
I said this 2 years ago. LI > NIO and Xpeng,btohqsg
Thks for sharing views.. me🙆🏻 bo headache only focus dntrend NIO for short term trading.. attach TA daily📉 4ref.. Can penny nio break💔 USD8 toward lower channel dntrendline near <7USD for an ep🤣,btohqsg
BYD is China's Tes la. Control the mass mkt EVs and only profitable EV manufacturer so far (exclude Tes la),btohqsg
BYD had a massive advantage. It wasn't even an even playing field. They were producing crappy cheap gas cars even before EVs,btohqsg
LI will be the next profitable one. But see how they can come out full EV,btohqsg
That's how they got the massive mkt reach. Cheap cars,btohqsg
Anyway that was my reaction in my brain whenever I see a BYD . 😁,btohqsg
I don't like their design....look cheapskate. But they should have higher end ones I never see,btohqsg
Higher relative to their segment. Anyone who buys for brand won't buy BYD,btohqsg
It'd the perfect car for those would you rather cry in a BMW or be happy in a BYD,btohqsg
Sg got China made car or not,btohqsg
That's why LI can sell 20+k SUVs a month.,btohqsg
That said the models Y and 3 really ruined the old Tsla image,btohqsg
Cos we bot their construction machineries then realised they hv cars,btohqsg
