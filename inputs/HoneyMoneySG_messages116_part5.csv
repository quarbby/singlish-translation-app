Different  it will appear in your Positions if you subscribe manually and not under Moneybull,btohqsg
Ahh I see. But apart from that and having to manually unsubscribe (longer processing periods) etc  the daily earnings should be similar as Moneybull right? ü§î,btohqsg
Performance is based on the underlying fund so yea shdnt be any different,btohqsg
Hi gurus! Does anyone know how UOB ladies count the spending per month?My transaction on the 5th June seems to be posted under the May‚Äôs bill.,btohqsg
bonus points cap is based on transactions posted in calendar month  nothing to do with billing/statement month,btohqsg
what u mean by May's bill? Sound strange for 5th June transaction to be posted under May bill,btohqsg
What is your statement date? Bonus cat follows calendar month so no confusion there.,btohqsg
Transaction under 5June occured under May‚Äôs bill statement.,btohqsg
Ah! Got it‚Ä¶ statement date is 12-June  that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ thanks all üòä,btohqsg

yes! apologies for the confusion ü´†,btohqsg
To avoid confusion  you can ask UOB cso to update ur statement month to calendar month.,btohqsg
I googled it just now  intending to do so as well! Thanks for the tip!,btohqsg
Hi. Is Chri‚Äôs link to ibkr broken? I tried to access but cant,btohqsg
Many reports saying it's working. But just enjoy silently will do üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah and imagine getting fined up to $50k if found associated to an illegal activity just for that $20/week ü§™,btohqsg
I think you remember wrong  SoCash was used to withdraw cash from merchants.,btohqsg
I mean it even YouTubers say it's good. I even try it out for myself. If you dun want to believe me  I have nothing to say eother,btohqsg
If follow the latest promo  you need to withdraw 20 days ago already.,btohqsg
Still better to use Amaze + CRMC at that rate. Trust card 0.22% only  compared to 0.27% after accounting for 2% spread.,btohqsg
No one say it's bad  just that people need to know the risk of using such apps. YouTubers are paid to advertise for these products.YouTubers also say FTX is good  but we all know what came after. ü•¥,btohqsg
I would still use CRMC x Amaze combo strictly for miles redemption instead of cashback  be it local or overseas spend. I can't stand leaving lost value at the table,btohqsg
Yup. Cashback probably better off using GXS and it's lucky draw. If need ATM withdrawal then YouTrip.,btohqsg
Even I locked the citibank rewards card  it can still be used for transactionAdditionally  fraudulent transaction can still be made on my old card and appear on my statement,btohqsg
Blocked and replaced...but still can make transaction on my old card üôÉ,btohqsg

Its stated till April 2024,btohqsg
There were suspected cases merchants ‚Äúwork‚Äù with customers to do many SoCash transactions so that both sides benefitted. So what you see is these merchants have very high usage of SoCash transactions being done with a usual group of people. After a while  SoCash detected these cases and blocked the merchants from offering SoCash. In the early days  the rewards from SoCash were quite generous.,btohqsg
"True. Actually the ""cashback"" for withdrawing cash quite good. I remembered when I used it in the earlier days.",btohqsg
Hi all  I had been trying to search history on UOB privi and agoda 6 miles benefit but couldn't find anythingI recently sign up the card  make a purchase via agoda app. But the UNI$ did not reflect the 6 mpd.E.g. I spend $190. By right I should get 1140 miles  equivalent of UNI$570. However I only get UNI$228. Anyone know why?,btohqsg
U need to use separate agoda UOB prvi pge to get that 6mpd. And that page price is usually more expensive,btohqsg
Just topup today with no issue,btohqsg
Has it been 3 months since you stayed-in and departed the hotel?Edit: you also need to use that link in the screenshot.,btohqsg
Just saw uob evol to be nerf.... Is there any good standard chartered card reward to apply before jump into bonus saver account and cardÔºü,btohqsg
it's pretty much meant for topping up TNG ewallet. ofc now if you want to make use of your cc credit limit there's the 1% fee to consider,btohqsg

SCB Smart Credit Card 6% cashback for selected merchants.,btohqsg
Which is better account to openOCBC 360 or UOB One?,btohqsg
Depends on how much you have and what criterias you can hit.,btohqsg
Has anyone done the comparison after the recent changes in the interest rates,btohqsg
How/where can I do the exact comparison,btohqsg
I think the top up function is not stable. After few tries just now  it is working now. Thanks for the reply. üëç,btohqsg
Like SCB smart credit card is a good one. Other spend can be covered under my other cards.,btohqsg
After i got the SCB Smart card application approved  i can immediately apply for bonus saver account rightÔºüboth the welcome offer should workÔºü,btohqsg
Just curious  what is deemed an acceptable cost per mile?,btohqsg
Really should ask yourself  individual valuation differ from person to person,btohqsg
Go to ur fav airlines and search for flights to your fav destinations during your fav time of the year. Compare how many miles required and how much it would cost in cash. Calculate cost per mile then add some of ur own buffer.,btohqsg
Cost of aquiring mile should be as low as possible  below 1.5 cents per mile. Eg. paying $197 annual fee for 10000 miles  1.97 cpm would be on the high side.,btohqsg
Don't really see anyone talk abt BOC. Is BOC saving acct bad?,btohqsg
Oh thanks. I didn't use the link but use the app directly. Is that why?,btohqsg
Likely yes. Next time please remember to use the special agoda page :),btohqsg
