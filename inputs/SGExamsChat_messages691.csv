if she in dentistry there wld be a chance she will be my dentist lol. since i go to nuh,btohqsg
unwra workers are mostly hamas also,btohqsg
Why does this make u feel upset,btohqsg
Your parents seem very toxic. Should try to get your own house asap and move away from them,btohqsg
if smth isn’t within your control  it’s asinine to remain upset bc of it,btohqsg
u able to move out after uni?,btohqsg
your brain cells are better used elsewhere,btohqsg
if its btr for u and u r financially stable,btohqsg
actly y u nvr try for hall?,btohqsg
She needs to unpack herself why she gets so upset by someone calling her results shit- is it cause her results are actually shit?- where did his even come from in the first place- why does she think her results are shit,btohqsg
Anyone who calls her shit or says she's not doing enough,btohqsg
So u need unpack that more,btohqsg
Why did ur parents make u feel ur results are shit,btohqsg
I mean she can say that she knows why,btohqsg
Why do her parents think anything that is not 90 is cmi lol,btohqsg
BEYOND THE STANDARD ASIAN PARENT ARGUMENT,btohqsg
This is all very general things,btohqsg
people are not as self aware as they think they are,btohqsg
the why usually got smth deeper one,btohqsg
L ord more than 300 days,btohqsg
Yall not getting what I'm saying,btohqsg
So im just not gonna bother explaining,btohqsg
I'm not asking her to fix her parents lol,btohqsg
Which is why therapy won't work,btohqsg
Would give the exact same prompts,btohqsg
But tbf I think she just looking to rant,btohqsg
therapy only works when you start to be more self aware,btohqsg
Maybe she just wanna deal with it,btohqsg
And the therapist would be the one needing therapy after,btohqsg
if i go for therapy and see josh there…,btohqsg
no cause like imagine if the person is in therapy because: they had mental health issues as their parents pressured them to choose a certain career (eg. Engineer) and theyre suffering burnout+mental health issues cause they cant find a purpose in their job + not earning much because of economy + overworkedjosh: L bozo why didn you choose something you liked,btohqsg
Like so urgh…i just feel very disgusted,btohqsg
True but i cant help it  sometimes i end up stirring shit by overcoming it by boasting grades over,btohqsg
If they want to talk shit in front of me,btohqsg
Why do u need to prove that ur good,btohqsg
Even if ur parents don't think ur good it's not like they can dispute what u got what,btohqsg
Facts don't care bout their feelings lol,btohqsg
Btw singles can only bto after 35 but im also feeling v 2 minded in this aspect,btohqsg
I just feel shit when they turn to my cousin for help  make me feel inferior in a sense,btohqsg
There's alot of people out thr looking for roommates,btohqsg
Either rental or buy resale flat,btohqsg
"I literally had 3 friends post on ig past 2 days ""anyone want room with me""",btohqsg
My dad can tell me u were no where near scholar material and then say they worried i fail A levels and then now say i scored well coz they stopped me fr joining band,btohqsg
Won’t the landlord needa agree to have this many people in a room?,btohqsg
Idk about it but like i cant bear to leave family but my parents are repeatedly treating me inferior to my fam,btohqsg
So petty sia  things like taking away your freedom from choosing your cca still want to take credit,btohqsg
Yes and i took so long for my dad to understand my unhappiness over my mum,btohqsg
But u can see that in an instant,btohqsg
Like literally 2h for him to understand my unhappiness,btohqsg
They just saying things blatantly disregarding my feelings,btohqsg
+ they went overseas during my A level study break  and then come say im selfish for complaining coz they tac along my mum’s business trip when cant be changed mah. Then come and freaking talk about that trip IN FRONT OF ME,btohqsg
I was considering sia cuz one of them was in pasir ris,btohqsg
+ my bro is nowhere near getting similar grades tbh…this is mean but reality,btohqsg
Oh nvm I thought uni students who couldn’t get hall or smth lol,btohqsg
My dad said he will help me talk my unhappiness to my mum but he hasnt lol,btohqsg
Coz if i tell her she wun even listen,btohqsg
Bud said it's not that deep,btohqsg
Exactly why do u need ur parents to affirm ur skills,btohqsg
oh I thought generally like get good good,btohqsg
I mean you know how some of the older gen ppl can act.. LOL they're in their own world and their beliefs can't just be simply changed overnight or in a matter of years,btohqsg
Andrea can become president of SG and the parents are still gnna talk bad about her,btohqsg
It just sucks that in front of me they are talking about things i dun like to hear,btohqsg
My siblings + my mum + my cousins,btohqsg
And then there is my dad who tells me ‘im very proud of your A levels  i boast to all my friends’,btohqsg
But down at home  he is clearly on my mum’s side,btohqsg
Claiming that he will talk to her but not yet,btohqsg
aiyo  just let her rant smh,btohqsg
she is not stupid and she knows everything yall just said,btohqsg
the chingay parade js now go past my hse sia,btohqsg
timothy not in any of the breakways i believe...,btohqsg
True he just doing what he needs to knowing my mum👀👀,btohqsg
Yea maybe i shld learn to live w people who dun recognise efforts and play favouritism denying it,btohqsg
Since nth is gonna change and im gonna just make things worst by arguing,btohqsg
Did you receive your results last week?,btohqsg
she’s in uni final year lol,btohqsg
So why the obsession over A level results then??? She literally made it pharm sci,btohqsg
don’t think too much about it,btohqsg
But tldr is that i feel being treated inferior  maybe my dad still cares  but it is mainly my mum who kinda idk how to put it but firstly clearly dun give a damn about how im doing (since jc times till now) and blatantly right in front of my face invest in my bro’s jc and see even MY COUSIN more than me bruh…and turn to my cousin to wake my bro up when what i am even to her…actually she was more pleased w my bro’s Os than my As / getting into pharm.,btohqsg
Like since screwing up psle  she see me a whole 360 degrees differently,btohqsg
How haz this convo been ongoing for 3h,btohqsg
yooo do u remember me gude,btohqsg
wars going on  havent been following at all lol,btohqsg
well i guess now you know how to do better as a future mom?,btohqsg
Andrea complaining abt her parents not validating her and us providing advice essentially,btohqsg
Chey I thought it was some family inheritance typa stuff,btohqsg
I’m guessing your bro is doing worse than you in sch  and it makes sense for your parents to be more fixated on his results lol  obv if your alr getting decent grades I don’t think any parent would be that concerned,btohqsg
Maybe that’s why they’re celebrating his smaller achievements  relative to you,btohqsg
Hello good sir  how's the GP essays going,btohqsg
Are you what they call a masochist,btohqsg
FR GP stories do be funny and what's funnier is u revisiting it from  time to time,btohqsg
there was the person that got pissed off at me cuz she thought my comments were misogynistic,btohqsg
i told her to change the always to largely then she said thats misogynistic,btohqsg
let alone the inherent flawed logic of this whole argument,btohqsg
Omg kuro your GP Cher is proud asf of u,btohqsg
Give yourself a pat on the back,btohqsg
S for promos for GP friend can tell me,btohqsg
And that's not meant to be an insult to my friend,btohqsg
Wah fuck she's deffo not destined to become a gp lecturer,btohqsg
Aren't you glad she's not gonna follow in your footsteps,btohqsg
ironically there are hints of misandry in here to me,btohqsg
when im marking an essay abt gender divide,btohqsg
I thank her for lowering the GP bellcurve in advance,btohqsg
(I will lose the will to live),btohqsg
I taking GP next yr instead,btohqsg

Wait why must gp be taken w H2 agains,btohqsg
I don't even care for A for GP alrs,btohqsg
THERE ARE NO LAWS ABOUT PUTTING UP PRIDE FLAGS IN SG,btohqsg
BRO COOKED AND BURNED DOWN THE KITCHEN,btohqsg
"i saw the ""since the very stone age""",btohqsg

If my friends ever ask for GP tuition,btohqsg
"""Females in Saudi Arabia indeed have seen slight improvements in terms of their life  being able to grant the fundamental right to drive on roads""",btohqsg
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DRIVE ON ROADS,btohqsg

idk where I've heard of this before but someone who was from boys sch saw some other guy throw shit into anotha guys mouth,btohqsg
Like one guy was getting out of shower,btohqsg
then idfk why anotha guy standby with the shit,btohqsg
not even the fucked up shit,btohqsg
there's a lot more to consider as a whole,btohqsg
But actly idk what would be needed to end up thr tho,btohqsg
just think stuff adults would go to prison for but as a juvenile,btohqsg
Then idk what she yapping then,btohqsg
the story i hear of sum1 pissing in the classroom💀,btohqsg
You can still do dumb shit and not go to jail lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile I got D for J2 MBTs and wth it was 80-100 percentile💀💀,btohqsg
Here is me in a course with a 3:1 female : male ratio,btohqsg
Bruh hmm…I can prove instances where it isn’t true  so it can’t be a largely,btohqsg
I mean I'm just giving her the benefit of doubt,btohqsg
I just dw her to write fking Always,btohqsg
But why is she so stubborn,btohqsg
If you can’t help yourself + you reject other’s help  I can’t say anything,btohqsg
Meanwhile ok actually it ain’t my brother’s fault coz he is autistic but he go ask my mum ‘do you like Andrea’. Ok he does this and ask everyone this all the time when he actually meant for us to ask him la…but then wtf my mum just right in front of my face told him no,btohqsg
My parents have never let me drink coz I had this anaphylaxis reaction in pri school to some nail polish lmao then they scared I can’t tolerate alcohol,btohqsg
Actually the first time I drank was with my friends in uni year 1,btohqsg
I’m very good with being secretive with my parents lol,btohqsg
except when it comes to ignoring them,btohqsg
I do so when I broke curfews many times in year 1/2 due to cca lmao,btohqsg
Coz I didn’t dare to tell them I have not left school,btohqsg
I can’t remember if it was 10 or 11,btohqsg
my fam just bought 20 1.5L from JB,btohqsg
When I was doing this shadowing in the hospital then there was this diabetes patient,btohqsg
He said he was aware what caused the onset of his DM  he has been drinking 5 cans of coke everyday and minimal water,btohqsg
I can’t even drink a bottle of coke,btohqsg
Speaking of which I will forget to drink water if a bottle of water is not anywhere near me,btohqsg
Actually speaking of curfews  there was once my cousin had to sleep in macdonalds coz his mum angry and lock the door lmao Oz he was too late,btohqsg
That is why…there is house key in my bag,btohqsg
i keep my house key in my wallet so,btohqsg
Coz my mum is a light sleeper and my dad dun really care as much as long as I come home safe,btohqsg
luckily mine wasn’t as life-threatening as it can get. Just swollen puffy face that looks like elephant,btohqsg
Funny that my elective mod I’m being more productive than my core mod lmao,btohqsg
But even so  I dun think I can finish the paper tmr,btohqsg
+ what even bruh the exam is in the evening:-(,btohqsg
Not as bad tho coz I had cs friend  nus set the exam at 11pm,btohqsg
Well I guess it is hmmm,btohqsg
They cite that the class too big and very hard to find a common slot,btohqsg
i mean ntu engineering has saturday tests,btohqsg
I’m gonna try to score for econs but su computing FOR SURE,btohqsg
I’m not even doing anything besides attending labs,btohqsg
I remembered my pharm finals was on Saturday and everyone was pissed,btohqsg
Then the TA can come tell me ‘in exam everyone knows how to code  and the code itself gives B+’,btohqsg
Me: I’m lost  like how do I even start,btohqsg
My eyes can’t corporate with my body past 10.30,btohqsg
coding is learning a language and a thought process,btohqsg
a beginner class is typically very straightforward,btohqsg
sorry but wtf. ppl no need sleep ah,btohqsg
I'm glad I hate drinking coke zero unlike some ppl,btohqsg
coke zero is literally what makes up like 70-80% of their fking blood bro,btohqsg
You'd think maybe hey blood plasma phagocytes or wtv bs but naur,btohqsg
sometimes our research meetings are on saturday too,btohqsg
usually it’s saturday bc they have to coordinate a big cohort,btohqsg
depends on how your sem schedule is,btohqsg
i’ve had 4 day weeks my entire undergrad,btohqsg
in later sems you’ll have a lot more autonomy on how you wanna schedule your classes,btohqsg
classes will never be on sat,btohqsg
sat is only sometimes for tests,btohqsg
and that’s for usually engineering or cs those kind,btohqsg
then classes is at most mon to fri but sometimes can be less,btohqsg
big cohort  conflicting times so hard to accommodate everyone on weekdays,btohqsg
I'm glad you feel called out,btohqsg
but I wasn't only targeting you,btohqsg
lol but sometimes even small mod cohort need to take test on sat for some reason,btohqsg
this sem circuit analysis  my friend tell me only got 4 classes  still taking test on sat lol,btohqsg
i do have some midterms i was given the option to invigilate that are sat,btohqsg
I think it is coz I am forced to take it so I’m dreading it coz of lack of interest,btohqsg
Exactly my eyes wun be open enough at that time to do the paper  it is testing awakeness on top of your knowledge,btohqsg
Strangely I heard that cs bell curve is crazy. There are bunch at top bunch at bottom lmao..there was once where the TA was asked to remark the papers many many times to find some marks to give coz there were people who literally had 0 marks,btohqsg
It is coz fr the bus stop to my house  it is barely got any light  funny thing idk but my brother has never had real curfews and already started coming home late in secondary school and now…..it is funnier my dad told me tennis he is barely training where my band training is crazy when he literally had cca till 9pm,btohqsg
Sometimes my WiFi okok but liddat too,btohqsg
Then I fk it just use data,btohqsg
Sometimes patients when we ask ‘do u drink’  they think it is referring to water omo,btohqsg
Meanwhile my coding lab falls on nus well-being day and they freaking doing a Saturday make-up  lemme see if I will bring myself to go,btohqsg
This one depends on University and course…some course u get more flexibility in planning your schedule (especially SMU)  some courses (like mine) u get minimal flexibility lmao so I do have classes like 5x / week on most week this sem,btohqsg
There are classes on Saturday but I think people will only bid for those out of no choice or sth,btohqsg
I believe it is set my the University  like the fac itself dun get a say in when the uni wanna put the exam for different mods lmao,btohqsg
My tele has always been like that  idk why,btohqsg
okay sure  but at least you can su ba,btohqsg
I can tell the teacher is pissed with the class coz no one listening  everyone busy ChatGPT lmao,btohqsg
not surprised for pharm and med those kind. others tend to be better with it,btohqsg
not necessarily. for ntu  the assessment is entirely up to the course coordinator (subject to approval by the school). midterms those kind is up to the coordinator to set the date. finals is the uni set but the prof can request for change if there's no issue on the student's end,btohqsg
i'm sure diff unis can work that stuff diff,btohqsg
"*still imagining prof cheong siew ann's ""whiteboard test"" for those who need a make up test*",btohqsg
Hi there..I just applied for nanyang university scholarship ..Is there Any senior international student here??,btohqsg
its pe rn and im sitting out due to cramps,btohqsg

Have  my dad also office clerk,btohqsg
I mean actually for reals i dun really like half of my teachers  but i actually dun give a damn over how good the lecturers are,btohqsg
Oh lmao what is wrong w him tho,btohqsg
"""i'm not gay but if i was i'd definitely go for him""",btohqsg
the ppl next to me saying he very hot and whatnot,btohqsg
Meanwhile my math cher and ms nicollete chia is weirdly close,btohqsg
Like i think ms nicollete chia is married,btohqsg
top g and mr clean are among the many nicknames he has,btohqsg
But in school i see the 2 together,btohqsg
hes so cute when he scratches his hair >//< (his friends spread pics of me to others),btohqsg
Btw if that one is artery this one is the aorta,btohqsg
i nvr do my gp hw 👹👹,btohqsg
Tbh my bro keep talking abt his bald head vp,btohqsg
we have to write the opening para for a GP question,btohqsg
Hmmm nice advice when i hv an exam later,btohqsg
Could be because your Cher just couldn’t be bothered to teach,btohqsg
Please do NOT stick anything or write with purple pen on the whiteboards,btohqsg
Uk it is funny coz i recently went to scroll my gp grp chat  then i saw this part about people asking my cher his whereabouts,btohqsg
Which means he actually didnt turn up w/o telling us b4,btohqsg
I still don’t get how some chers like these aren’t fired,btohqsg
Erm coz they dun get proper appraisals and their own bosses saving their ass,btohqsg
Some of them I’ve heard of legit awol from class but no consequences,btohqsg
The only period he doesnt do it is cce ct time,btohqsg
oh yeah our PW qn is out,btohqsg
lol what isit about this year,btohqsg
Why my bro say they need come up w topic,btohqsg
u help me do my exam?,btohqsg
Is it because the other FT is there,btohqsg
like idk what theyre talking avt,btohqsg
hmmm maybe and i can say the other CT dun like my class,btohqsg
I thought the gp/pw Cher also wouldn’t have liked your class given his attitude,btohqsg
What at this time??? No way,btohqsg
I want to nap in the office but can’t cos I’m a light sleeper,btohqsg
My other cher hates my class coz maj of my class dun study and ofc results showing la,btohqsg
I remembered she nags at us after returning Chem scripts,btohqsg
My room can get quite cold cos central AC,btohqsg
But u can say he hates me coz my parents complain,btohqsg
my topic is nth compared to yalls one,btohqsg
ok at least it's pass fail,btohqsg
I have free period until 3pm,btohqsg
Or maybe patterns of behaviour yeah,btohqsg
I dun care about gp still got C,btohqsg
And im proud of this achievement,btohqsg
My prelim was freaking E 20-40 percentile lmao,btohqsg
Wah that is really long  bed time,btohqsg
my timetable longest break is 1h30min,btohqsg
Coz i remembered last time i freaking hv to wait forever for chinese class (at 3.30/4),btohqsg
Then the chinese day is the day i end class at 5.45,btohqsg
I like the shirt more than anything ekse,btohqsg
I actually cant remember what u did,btohqsg
My cousin book in 6pm yesterday at jurong,btohqsg

They'll give the j1s at like,btohqsg
Im wearing my calisto shirt now,btohqsg

Ngl mj’s houses are better than tm’s houses,btohqsg
u saw the 2024 ori shirt for ogms/ogls or not,btohqsg
My house name before it merged,btohqsg
It's a lowk rip off of 2023 ori,btohqsg
"when i saw it i thought ""huh another blue shirt""",btohqsg
then that day some mf take my bag,btohqsg
It literally just rote ‘orientation 2024’,btohqsg
their ori shirts are like that,btohqsg
and the shirt is bright red,btohqsg
the 2023 ori ogl shirt what color,btohqsg
o yeah what is the other tmjc polo tee that's blue color,btohqsg
sec sch i have like 4 shirts,btohqsg
1 of which the color damn ugly,btohqsg
i only wear one sec sch shirt nowadays,btohqsg
but the tmjc logo feels out of place,btohqsg
still an upgrade from my sec sch,btohqsg
so far i have aquila and corvus,btohqsg
It's true it was future me,btohqsg
the reason i nvr put corvus 1st is bc one of my sec sch shirts alr dark blue,btohqsg
the front got sch logo then the back is the sch name,btohqsg
idk i think it's kinda borung,btohqsg
then this yr sec sch new pe shirt,btohqsg
make all the students look like tigers,btohqsg
HAHA forgot the PPE yellow coat,btohqsg
apparently there's some stuff in h1 that isn't in h2,btohqsg
"We always wonder  what does ""O"" stand for",btohqsg
I was supposed to study but ended up scrolling through old msgs,btohqsg
i feel like throwing up everyday,btohqsg
i think i may have health issues as a result of too many meals skipped,btohqsg
im confused why if the PPC only shifts one way  then why the widget can produce more ah,btohqsg
coz zero emission only affect the production of clean env,btohqsg
man mei mei btr get it sorted out or smth,btohqsg
my mom says my period irregular cause of my healthy lifestyle,btohqsg
ig you can always get a body checkup nowadays ykwim blood test and shit  ,btohqsg
but idk leh if they allow uh teens to do do that without adults consent those stuff,btohqsg
how irregular is irregular. i got a fren her one come every few mths,btohqsg
and then right it lasts for like less then 5 days,btohqsg
If there with the pivoted shift on the diagram I thought it meant that in order to “produce” (idk what phrasing to use) one more unit of cleaning the environment they would need to give up fewer units widgets? Like with the opportunity cost of cleaning the environment has been reduced. Can see it on the diagram if you draw it. But max amount of widgets that can be produced hasn’t increased  just that with a given amount of cleaning envt/emissions reductions produced  more widgets can still be produced with the remaining resources.,btohqsg
The qn says “relative to what it was making previously”  and it did not say all resources were devoted to making widgets previously,btohqsg
What do you usually eat in a day lol?,btohqsg
do yall use chatGPT often for studying for O/N/A-Levels?,btohqsg
i don't use chstgpt wt all,btohqsg
How do you know my name starts with O 😂,btohqsg
Its quite accurate if u ask a very clear cut qn,btohqsg
But they dont tell u ans like which phone brand better,btohqsg
The prob is u don't bother trying to hide,btohqsg
Uk u need to at least put in some effort,btohqsg
yes forcheatingon mcq practice. but the ans all vv inconsistent so i stopped.(don't copy me tqvm),btohqsg
I see  probably cus chatgpt is not finetuned for our syllabus right,btohqsg
I feel it may b quite useful if it becomes more accurate with more info on our questions and syllabus,btohqsg
considering that chatgpt failed psle  i have ntg to say,btohqsg
Depends what kind of qns are u asking,btohqsg
If u ask maths and physics/chem qns chances if chatgpt getting it correct is higher,btohqsg
And can use it to finetune ur english,btohqsg
Somebody struck this on the wall in the toilet at NTU,btohqsg
Grammly and chatgpt helps alot to improve ur eng,btohqsg
oh i thought maths/econs questions anyt to do with numbers chatgpt was quite weak,btohqsg
Offered diff perspective or xtra points tht i missed,btohqsg
I ask chatgpt to solve my maths qns tho,btohqsg
But ofc it isnt 100% ah,btohqsg
are yalls studying for O/N or A-levels rn?,btohqsg
im thinking of creating one for our syllabus,btohqsg
