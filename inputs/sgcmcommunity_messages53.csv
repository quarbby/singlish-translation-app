Technically yes but to the eyes of the gov no,btohqsg
Read before a news asking them to shut down their office,btohqsg
Wow i rather spend 3k more get a fd2r 😱,btohqsg
EV is the way to go,btohqsg
Sorry but based on NEA rules  one can idle for upto 5 minutes before facing a fine and I do think warming up an engine in the morning for engine health is good and in fact can result in a smoother running engine that burns more fuel and gives off less unburnt fuel out the exhaust,btohqsg
Anything that is not factory fitted is illegal,btohqsg
Are you Mr Pete's long lost sibling?,btohqsg
I only have 1:16 lambo collections,btohqsg
There's a few in sgcarmart around 17-18k .,btohqsg
Depends from engine to engine  some really need to be taken care of and warmed up  but I do believe that you can get by if you just wait for your idle revs to come down and drive off slowly  don't have to wait for it to climb completely upto temperature all the time.,btohqsg
Fd2 still can hold its value 😏,btohqsg
tbh everyth legal if u dont get caught,btohqsg
uh then akra bastuck eisenmann all not made by manufacturer but legal,btohqsg
Go by left but dun get caught 😂,btohqsg
but as the saying goes  STOCK IS BEST,btohqsg
Police gave lta and cisco the authority 😂,btohqsg
Sometimes LTA can be a bit annoying,btohqsg
I know a few people running bone stock  still have been stopped by LTA for on site inspection,btohqsg
Not loud cars as well  regular 4 cyl sedans,btohqsg
Just stock car and do a stock tune up can liao,btohqsg
5 mins overkill heh. 1 min I think okI really dont think there is a need for idle warm up. You can warm up your car by moving slowly on gear 1 as well; slowly take off.I do note that warming up is a thing in winter climate,btohqsg
1 minute good enough for revs to come down,btohqsg
Now grab waiting time only 3 mins LMAO,btohqsg
For newer cars  once you shift into gear  it forces the revs down and disrupts to warm up cycle as@jerrycxwmentioned,btohqsg
But yes  can wait for revs to come down  then just drive out slowly,btohqsg
Old cars have choke that will make initial start up rev a little higer.,btohqsg

I am Direct Buyer looking for Direct Owner to buy a Honda Fit with 3 years or less. Able to pay full amount. Looking for depreciation below 10 000 and well maintained car. Please PM if you are keen to let go of yours (:,btohqsg
Only one consignment car below 30k,btohqsg
Any amount that is below 30k,btohqsg
SG has 1. My SA called me to faster come down to the showroom to view when it was first brought in...,btohqsg
Nowadays 2k more dep still got so many ppl buy one 🥲,btohqsg
Two years ago only 7k dep per year,btohqsg
All don't apply to me lmao,btohqsg
Why are you limited to direct owner only though? Just curious,btohqsg
Also for direct owner  there may be some listings on other platforms that sort of rhyme with doorbell,btohqsg
Maybe want to avoid unnecessary fees,btohqsg
Can do so with dealers too  just that it's harder to negotiate if you secure your own insurance and pay in cash/secure own loan,btohqsg
But if a dealer is not letting you finance yourself and get your own insurance  walk away cause not gonna be a good experience anyway,btohqsg
Idk man  like I spoke to 20 over car dealers the past few days and it’s like some aren’t that trustworthy to me,btohqsg
Ah I see  must try to do a basic inspection and look for a clean unit,btohqsg
Luckily for Fit  even if you do run into issues  will be relatively easy fixes and parts easy to source,btohqsg
Got one of them tried selling me 17800  saw the exact same car from another account at 14k. Then he offered 12k kind. Some feels like they are trying to push off the vehicle as tho it has issues. And some got a lot of hidden fees,btohqsg
Can try STA also for a basic inspection too,btohqsg
Direct owner can also be full of issues bah  and later cannot run back to them as well  they say not mechanically sound so they don't know,btohqsg
Ya definitely. But they were saying car with so little years remaining confirm a lot of problem,btohqsg
Just about finding the right dealer and unit,btohqsg
give me..important is cheaper than dealer. I bought 6 cars  5 direct owners 1 dealer,btohqsg
Ya got some dealers is quickly snatch the units then resell again one,btohqsg
Definitely have wear and tear  the thing to look for is a healthy powertrain with no major issues,btohqsg
Small things like engine mountings  bushings  oil change required etc. are all part of regular wear and tear,btohqsg
I agree. Def going for the checks no matter which car or dealer,btohqsg
Must budget for that when buying any used car,btohqsg
Nicee  but in this case no direct owner options so need to broaden the scope of search,btohqsg
The hidden dealer fees is usually when you pay cash  they bump up the price because they aren't able to earn their loan commission,btohqsg
If they object to you securing your own loan or paying in cash and aren't cooperative  walk away,btohqsg
my experience is direct owner is more honest  dealer like to smoke,btohqsg
of course that is if the seller is not young hahaha ooops,btohqsg
Chances are that a direct owner will usually be honest but there's bad apples on both sides,btohqsg
It's upto you to be alert and cautious,btohqsg
Just check at own ws or sta  the +-$100 well worth to prevent pain,btohqsg
My experience with dealers has been pretty good in the past,btohqsg
well its luck  my stat is not good. try 1 already pain,btohqsg
no la  buy lemon just ownself rebuild at home😈😈,btohqsg
direct owner try 5 all good,btohqsg
i like this  i fixed all the cars i bought,btohqsg
now i know where to fix and knows so many shops,btohqsg
newer cars to me abit hard,btohqsg
But I get what you mean,btohqsg
all the coding of ecu and everyth i cmi,btohqsg
yeah so far i only bought old cars,btohqsg
while waiting for my suzuki sport,btohqsg
But maybe try out buying from a dealer again  maybe different dealer will offer you a better experience,btohqsg
💪💪💪💪 you will get it soon!!,btohqsg
Then you can come over to the sgcm meet,btohqsg
And show us your brand new ride,btohqsg
Fit is cuter and got v tec !!!!!,btohqsg
Wait for some to come on the used market,btohqsg
pay cash showroom unit also want 123k,btohqsg
u want u sign contract now,btohqsg
What I've seen is that most new car dealers and their in house pre owned dealers tend to put on the most pressure,btohqsg
but the yellow sport is so nice,btohqsg
Because they run on tight targets,btohqsg
For independent dealerships  they have limited inventory to work with so their purchases more calculated and they sell accordingly and just move units as and when they can,btohqsg
Usually don't put too much pressure on you,btohqsg
gg... need use binomial distribution liao,btohqsg
At least from all the used car dealers I have been to,btohqsg
Today I just learnt that the power windows are just literally a tamiya motor inside.So maybe if you find your window winding too slow  consider changing the motor to hyperdash 😂,btohqsg
Some definitely act pushy and get you to sign on the day and hide information/act fishy,btohqsg
@$$ isn't accepted by the bots apparently,btohqsg
Motorist toto or sg pools toto harder to win,btohqsg

U won’t buy 1 la. Kaki gong kaki song only,btohqsg
MRT faster than car these days  not a bad choice,btohqsg
bus faster than car anot though?🤔🤔,btohqsg
u still have to wait for bus etc,btohqsg
alot of things come into play,btohqsg
fastest is still commit crime get police escort,btohqsg
Petewhy you like that ah? Don't need call people ugly and be so negative. Positive vibes only! - J,btohqsg
i was considering both of those cars too,btohqsg
Surprisingly GTI didn't increase price as much as other performance cars,btohqsg
but mk7.5 has better space and more comfortable  better tech and (maybe) better reliabilitybut the megane has better oomph  styling and performance/handling bits,btohqsg
four wheel steering and valve exo frm factory mannn,btohqsg
I very +ve 1. But if ppl gjw  no need give face 1,btohqsg
so how has ur car search been,btohqsg
Lancer ex then buy evo body kit,btohqsg
last time our grp got the avante,btohqsg
later they tell u 70k without engine,btohqsg
2008 ver  how can it be cheap,btohqsg
Let me throw a monkey wrench in there and suggest a mini gp3. The rarest and coolest of the lot  but also the most expensive.,btohqsg
You're not wrong  but it has to be soemthing i can afford ma,btohqsg
The cheapest one now is 21k depre  not far off from the 7.5 gti,btohqsg
In comparison  the gti has more mark up than the gp3. So u pay less but its also less bang for buck or less worth it,btohqsg
can match carplate to the unit number also,btohqsg
harlo guys. how do you DIY wrap ur car interior without heat gun or hair dryer since mscp dh plug,btohqsg
Sir.. Hao siang kinda missing 2 seats lehhhhh 😂,btohqsg
jcw also can throw in the mix,btohqsg
reliability wise cooper S is about the same as GTI right  i'd take GTI over that for the better cockpit and parts availability,btohqsg
haven't really considered mini  the centre panel a bit turn off for me,btohqsg
haha ya the screen abit too small for me if not i’d love the clubman s actually,btohqsg
that's a pretty good budget option,btohqsg
but i waiting for price to drop tbh  not worth to buy now,btohqsg
the new vrs can tune to 300hp 😍,btohqsg
don't think price will drop  only can wait for COE to drop,btohqsg
the so called experts say the coe won't go down for another year or 2,btohqsg
my mummy say hor.. if you have nothing good to say  then just don't say anything especially when nobody asked to hear it.,btohqsg
having a convo with a bot,btohqsg
Me lol i acci press the warn thingy,btohqsg
i watched them live recently. and did take an Ioniq5 to the concert (need to stay within the car theme in this channel otherwise kena kick to the KPOP IDOL channel then cham),btohqsg
The newer ones quite big  have iDrive 7,btohqsg
And can always upgrade it as well,btohqsg
like that i want bmw also haha,btohqsg
Ya probably. Bmw vs vw. But ya gti would have more parts availability  aftermarket and factory. Just a little plain vanilla for me,btohqsg
Not so budget anymore. Budget in today's terms but i refuse to pay that premium in this market,btohqsg
Or cupra? Got one ateca for sale now. U probably dont need the seats and space  but dont have any leon st or the formentor for sale,btohqsg
Ya it is  only the 冷门 brands offer better value now,btohqsg
Still cant believe a coe megane rs is only asking 10k depre,btohqsg
The rcz also asling 10k depre  but that one a bit too extreme,btohqsg
rcz a bit too niche liao,btohqsg
Also too many owners for comfort,btohqsg

Thanks sir for the feedback! our vintage cars are all under 'Categories',btohqsg
but vintage cars have non classic car schemes,btohqsg
and shldnt vintage cars be 35 years and older instead of 40?,btohqsg
cos 35 year is the year where they can be converted to ccs,btohqsg
then vintage cars include this cars??,btohqsg
just my 2 cents arhh dont be offended😂😂,btohqsg
not really  vintage in looks only ma,btohqsg
morgan plus 4 uses a bmw inline 4 engine,btohqsg

vintage car scheme is cars before 1940,btohqsg
Can the sports car category be more refined?,btohqsg
As it is very cluttered right now with basically anything with two doors  the word coupe in there along with genuine sports cars,btohqsg
I understand why this has been done but maybe another category could be considered for pure performance cars so that scirocco 1.4s don't flood the list while one looks for a GTI or JCW,btohqsg
Like this is definitely not a sports car,btohqsg
And maybe the SUVs could have similar categories to sedans,btohqsg
Especially because a lot of crossovers and sub 4 metre SUVs flood that category,btohqsg
What defines as a sports car,btohqsg
Yes  maybe the definition needs to be cleared up,btohqsg
Is it sporty looking car or car from brand known for performance cars?,btohqsg
Or is it genuine performance oriented cars,btohqsg
No I asked a genuine question,btohqsg
What is your definition of sports car,btohqsg
To me it is something that provides you accessible power at a relatively affordable price. A car where all the power can be utilized and offers a fun and focussed driving experience,btohqsg
U don’t kum gong . Car n truck cannot different,btohqsg

Sir  you are right. We will be changing the definition to 35 years old and older 🙂 these cars may fall under 'vintage vehicle scheme' or 'classic vehicle scheme',btohqsg
for this filter it is an 'include' function. meaning to say if the COE car is also a Direct Owner Sale car  it will be shown too!,btohqsg
but we understand it may be difficult to tell  i sent it to my ops team also,btohqsg

With then world goverment pushing for ev   byd currently really is like have everything to dethrone Toyota in years to come   maybe by 2030 every 1 treat Toyota like Kodak,btohqsg
maybe they are late in the game... when I went Shanghai 5 or 6 years ago. already saw alot byd EV  on the road,btohqsg
soon all our taxi fleet might be byd once those Toyota n Hyundai are scrapped,btohqsg
See the scale   supply chain   battery technology,btohqsg
One of them must have Telegram Premium sia. That emoji is locked,btohqsg
One of the new blood did that. It's okay! Just react with your heart can already. - J,btohqsg

Gotcha! Removed him from the group already-R,btohqsg
This seems very good 👍🏻 I just saw the video review from CarBuyer as well,btohqsg
Actually the line is blurred from manufacturers also. Merc cla is considered coupe  then bmw gran coupes also considered coupes.I think sports car is up to too much interpretation. it should just be removed entirely.Hot hatches can be in hatchbacks categorySuper saloons can be in sedan categoryConvertibles have their own categoryMaybe there can be a coupe category for a start,btohqsg
👏👏 bravo. This is the definition of listening to the people  no matter how small the voices or the changes are,btohqsg
While we are at it. Can there be a spell check or words suggestions in the search bar? I have fat fingers and always having typos,btohqsg
Are the categories chosen by the dealers or assigned by sgcm?Sometimes when i see the used car listing  the category does not match  i wonder if it was the second hand dealer or sgcm misassigned when it was new.,btohqsg
..and VW beetle is considered a sedan.,btohqsg
I have a legit qns. I have a 3 years old Audi A3 1.0A. Bought it a year back when COE was low.With the current cost of living   I’m wondering if it makes sense to down grade the car to a Yaris cross hybrid.Drove before JDM and conti. So I don’t mind driving back to JDM.Wondering if it makes sense to get a brand new Yaris cross hybrid.,btohqsg
yeah if it saves you lots of money,btohqsg
it is just a tool. car,btohqsg
No worries. I’m not ashamed to down grade. Is reality of life. And is an Audi A3 not A8. Haha.Just wondering if it makes sense to get a brand new hybrid or just suck it up and continue driving the car.,btohqsg
Just compare the total spending on the car per month…. Depreciation  patrol  road tax  maintenance etc,btohqsg
okay dont talk about face la,btohqsg
got alot of things to consider,btohqsg
A3 resale now vs next timeYaris u buying new? need to include coe premium nowYaris second hand valuerunning costetc etc,btohqsg
ya mann  thumbs up to sgcm 🫶🫶,btohqsg
I will think both.E.g. listing an auto car as manual transmission.The is 99% car dealer/seller fault,btohqsg
You’re a confused person. If you want to save money why get a new car?,btohqsg
Get a good used car. A Japanese or Korean that is reliable to save you money.,btohqsg
if want to save money sell car and take public transport,btohqsg
Wouldn't consider it sucking it up with the a3 because u bought it way lower than the current market.Even if u make money from the sale  make sure it covers the extra difference for the yaris cross due to coe hike. And there's no way of telling if you can sell the yaris cross with no loss in future if coe is low when u are trying to sell the car.,btohqsg
Never encountered something that drastic before but i guess it could happen if dealers pick off the video,btohqsg
I agree that the lines are blurred  hence the proposal for performance oriented cars,btohqsg
And cars with sporty body types to be separated,btohqsg
U mean like specific performance versions of bread and butter cars like the gti  the i30N  focus st  jcw?These seperated with sporty looking cars like the veloster  koup  rcz etc etc?,btohqsg
Ya the classic m  s/rs  amg,btohqsg
Anything that is focussed on providing better performance driving basically,btohqsg
It could be a tough one but its worth a try. Kinda feel like we doing a cool wall like on top gear.,btohqsg
After that im sure there are some models that falls into the cracks but thats a given with what manufacturers do these days,btohqsg
Is the giulia/stelvio super considered sporty? Or has to be veloce hahahaha,btohqsg
Infinity q50 2.0  jag 2.0 sedans... Those get pretty blur,btohqsg
These days a lot of cars do multiple things,btohqsg
But the category should be based on what it is positioned more towards with a well defined classification,btohqsg
Because currently the sports car category is cluttered with all sorts of things,btohqsg
For most of us  much easier to figure out what we want as we can just look for the exact model or use multiple variables to filter,btohqsg
But there's enough people out there who could use the classification to better understand the cars they're looking at and figure out what they want to buy easily,btohqsg
Ya actually this will be more for the masses,btohqsg
There isnt a unified definition of a sports car hence the confusion and mix up,btohqsg
Yeah and it'll also help classify stuff better for the Karen's and Aaron's so that they don't go around calling everything a sports car,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminmaybe can consider hiring me and@arnavgulianias part timers? We'll do a proper clean up of the database,btohqsg
Sit there and sort all the models on sale,btohqsg
I wonder what they think of a tesla model Y dual motor,btohqsg
Or worst  a ford mach e,btohqsg
Because it is a regular SUV looking car,btohqsg
They aren't aversed to them somehow,btohqsg
Anyone went down to the meet?,btohqsg
Even though many EV drivers tend to be the worst on the roads,btohqsg
With their launches  lack of signal usage and aggressive driving,btohqsg
Already very good. From 50 mil to now 150 mil,btohqsg
Neither do teslas and other EVs of similar price range get the same jealousy driven hate from them for being expensive,btohqsg
I think there are people still there,btohqsg
When a model Y dual motor with COE is close to 300k,btohqsg
I believe most have left already,btohqsg
I went by with my rickshaw,btohqsg
By the time i reach i be there sweeping the floor,btohqsg
Tesla brought in a new wave of car owners who never thought they would own a car,btohqsg
Or you meant new waves of richass,btohqsg
And the surge of phv and rental cars in recent years also diluted the quality of daily drivers e.g. taxi drivers. Even though its not like they are fantastic from the start,btohqsg
To be frank  when the model 3 launched  it was 150 or 160+ for the sr+,btohqsg
Agreed  as they are not in it for the driving  rather there as technology enthusiasts,btohqsg
The incentives and competitive nature of ride hailing services have really affected the driving skills of a lot of drivers who are rushing to complete more and more trips in a day,btohqsg
It was super good value for the tech and cool factor even if ur not into performance,btohqsg
The number of rich owners sprouting up,btohqsg
Especially after the costs they had to bear during the pandemic,btohqsg
And because others see this driving style and don't see much consequences  they follow suit in their private cars,btohqsg
Back then 150k i think would be cars like the honda accord  toyota camry kind of range?,btohqsg
That was also when the COE was basically down to 30 to 40k I believe,btohqsg
When the Model 3 came out,btohqsg
It was competing directly with the c180 and a4 with the A4 being around 135k with offers,btohqsg
Yeah probably  so i would say at least 60% of the car owners could afford it,btohqsg
Model 3 coming in at 150ish with fsd,btohqsg
Nobody knew that tesla would be so popular,btohqsg
Dont think so. It was 30k after the bidding hiatus. And it never looked back.,btohqsg
And the hongkie who tried to import in his tesla,btohqsg
Especially because at the time it was launched  a lot of car owners were looking at purchasing second cars  a lot of people were upgrading with money they would spend on other things now spent on cars and of course the tech enthusiasts,btohqsg
Cant be. Fsd was a 11k option before arf,btohqsg
So if u specced it it should be well over 160,btohqsg
And with the global hype created around Tesla with basically every other influencer having one and Elon musk having the command he does through twitter,btohqsg
The guy who started the trend,btohqsg
Oh sorry my bad  not fsd but the middle option that was available with some assists  not all the self driving features,btohqsg
Apparently not enough cos dogecoin never recovered,btohqsg
Just the regular autopilot i think,btohqsg
Anyway it just shows no matter what rules the govt come up with  people still own cars  still buy new cars.,btohqsg
I don't think he wanted it to recover,btohqsg
He clearly made significant personal gains from it,btohqsg
They should just cut us some slack by reducing cost of ownership  and let the citizens dig their own grave when traffic piles up everywhere  and then people might actually start taking public transport,btohqsg
There's always someone who is willing to pay the price,btohqsg
Not as obvious as the twitter sale. He could have shorted it before the hoohaa,btohqsg
Here's the issue with that  if the traffic does increase. People will just start blaming the government again and not all of these new owners will go back to using public transport,btohqsg
People will always be around to complain,btohqsg
The grass is always greener on the other side,btohqsg
But no matter what they do  people will still complain. So might as well let the poeple taste what would happen if measures are not in place,btohqsg
U cant tighten the belt forever,btohqsg
If cars became cheap enough to keep them at home and be weekend cars. I would gladly take public transport to work or anywhere,btohqsg
Just need to send them to places like Jakarta  Manila or many cities in India,btohqsg
Yuppp  but I guess we can't have everything now can we,btohqsg
Although I know of people who have purchased 2 or more cars under the classic car scheme,btohqsg
Maybe we should apply to work at LTA instead of sgcm,btohqsg
And they use them over the weekend,btohqsg
While they use public transport for work,btohqsg
Yup there are actually quite a number of them. Dont have to be uber rich  just have enough passion to splash the cash,btohqsg
Mostly alfas and mercedes i would think,btohqsg
A good mix from what I've seen,btohqsg
Im not a classics guy  so i dont know the other brands haha,btohqsg
Time to go look at the new category coming on sgcm!!,btohqsg
old bmws are actually one of the least renewed cars or classic cars here,btohqsg
Cant understand why people prefer merc,btohqsg
There's a lot coming in now as imports,btohqsg
Reliability is one of the top criteria i believe. But i find bmws more appealing. Sorry bmw fan here haha,btohqsg
I think a lot of mercs around because it is easier worldwide to find parts for them because a lot of countries still have old mercs running,btohqsg
"And they were more famous in their respective eras as well as ""boss cars""",btohqsg
I think there is a pretty old b5 or b7 here,btohqsg
If can import as normal scheme better,btohqsg
Instead of the stupid 45 days,btohqsg
Actually i dont know how they get around that,btohqsg
I thought importing a used car cannot be more than 3 yrs old,btohqsg
But anyway  not like i will import one anytime soon. I'd rather catch some sleep now,btohqsg
Good talk! See u at sgcm office tomorrow hahaha,btohqsg
And dream of the winning number for tmr so you can import one alpina b3/5 in,btohqsg
Cant win if you dont buy,btohqsg
