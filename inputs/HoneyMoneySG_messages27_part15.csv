Hi guys  why is the Citi rewards card recommended more than the OCBC titanium? Is there some gotcha I'm missing? Isn't both in the same shopping category?,btohqsg
I paid Singtel bill with EVOL and confirmed it is others.,btohqsg
So long as you don‚Äôt charge excluded and travel related spend on Citi Rewards  if it‚Äôs online it‚Äôs 10x points.Many of us have both cards and the latter card OCBC TR has many gotchas  but most essentially  you can‚Äôt expect to shop online in certain stores and get the 10x points on OCBC TR  especially the stuff I get too much: Limited EDT and Oakley,btohqsg
Ah so it's shopping but even within shopping titanium has a lot of exclusions?,btohqsg
Yes. Because that card only ‚Äúsees‚Äù the MCCs (the assigned 4 digit number to every merchant by MasterCard and Visa). Only a select few MCCs are included.If the shops  such as Oakley  do not belong to those MCCs  we simply don‚Äôt get 10x points. Better off paying with other cards that give more rewards  such as UOB VS/PPV and Amaze card tagged to Citi Rewards.,btohqsg
Alas it seems Citi rewards doesn't include telco bills,btohqsg
I got 10x points from paying one time payment every time paying on Singtel app‚Ä¶,btohqsg
