you mean the one where it was lost on a train..or the exam papers heist,btohqsg
wait can we also buy back the marked scripts lol?,btohqsg
apparently once the scripts are marked..it remains in the country it was sent to,btohqsg
SS is the only exception..its the only paper that remains in singapore,btohqsg
imagine old British grandparents marking chiüíÄ,btohqsg
i tot cld buy back for $50,btohqsg
i read they cambridge outsource their markers to china and india,btohqsg
eh wait no isnt mt marked locally,btohqsg
so maybe the general MT papers are marked locally but the more intensive like chinese studies etc are not,btohqsg
The funniest part is Art is marked locally,btohqsg
as if we have a comparable art scene to the rest of the world,btohqsg
Hopefully you guys not going to join politics  after getting rejected by an art institution.,btohqsg
found this vid on how they mark our pprs,btohqsg
sounds like smt u have to do,btohqsg
i saw one saying a fan caught fire during paper 1,btohqsg
Mb we slightly bullied the slacker,btohqsg
Can I say the r word,btohqsg
oh yea I saw this. crazy shitz,btohqsg
i bully the instructor last time,btohqsg
he asked me to put the food inside my clothes that will make me look pregnant,btohqsg
because there was a pack of monkeys staring at us,btohqsg
so i made him do that instead,btohqsg
My friends grp got raided by monkeys,btohqsg

for us  we went to palau ubin,btohqsg
and see kampong hse and slumps,btohqsg
honestly not all are entitled  i mean we‚Äôre js unlucky if u see it from our pov,btohqsg
all our exams are new syllabus and mostly its way tougher than previous papers üíÄ,btohqsg
new syllabus does not mean harder paper,btohqsg
r u even 07? if youre not then u shldnt compare üòÅüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
in fact i was meeting with my sec sch teachers they said that it was expected,btohqsg
is just that alot of yall expected the paper to follow past trends so when it doesnt all of a sudden yall cannot adapt,btohqsg
nope but many of my 07 friends have said that it was an easy paper u just need to think more,btohqsg
I‚Äôm surprised that the o level papers were that hard,btohqsg
isnt that an indirect way of calling those who think its hard stupid üíÄ,btohqsg
and that the n level ones are somehow easy,btohqsg
aka the batch that complains the most about oh they are being selectively spotted by cambridge to be a guinea pig for hard test papers,btohqsg
Did the bell curve give you a good grade,btohqsg
don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs a bell curve,btohqsg
Does the bell curve exist for math,btohqsg
no it just means yall dont actually know what yall are studying,btohqsg
yall are studying to take the test vs even understanding the content in the first place.if you understnad the content u can apply it to any context,btohqsg
Nothing that was tested in the papers were out of syllabus,btohqsg
i mean like its not like all of them found every qn hard,btohqsg
If thats the case then why yall complaining so much,btohqsg
complain about the question lah not the whole paper üíÄ,btohqsg
those that complain abt the whole paper clearly nvr study,btohqsg
theres people complaining abt the whole paper,btohqsg
yall like every other qn want complain,btohqsg
im js talking abt those ppl who complained abt certain qns,btohqsg
the solar panel qn in syllabus also want complaingraph qn also want complain,btohqsg
its the people going we are test guinea pigs and set hard papers,btohqsg
sorry ah but that‚Äôs not me üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
js saying certain qns so i cant defend those who said everything was hard,btohqsg
no one was talking abt u we were talking abt the batch uw say ur better go say ur better lor,btohqsg
got ppl complain emath paper 1 got more than 24 qns when cambridge said themselves there will be about 26 questions in the paper üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
For my group I was the only one in prcs at the end,btohqsg
not the responsibility of the cher to tell the students what to study for the students themsleves should have went to read the syllabus doc and prepare for it,btohqsg

they changed it this year ah,btohqsg
back in my days we just do alr and suck thumb or prat for best,btohqsg

oh man..girl gonna be shot on sight,btohqsg
what are the chances we did,btohqsg
i worked so hard for every subj since i have been hospitalised and sick throughout my entire 4 years in sec sch. i hv been neglected my health to the point that the doctors are even concerned abt it as the probability of getting cancer from gastric was high. i also have ion deficiency but i often skipped lunch to go to teacher consultations js so i wld achieve a single digit. it got to the point that there was stomach ulcer. to make it worse  i‚Äôm allergic to wheat so i can‚Äôt eat anything in the canteen. i calculated my marks  for prelims and did not exceed my expectations. what hurt me the most was my trusted teacher telling me that i would not be successful w/o having a decent grade. i neglected my mental health and spent 10h studying everyday js so i can exceed everyone expectations. aft exams  i calculate my results and i only achieve b3 / b4. i heard frm my teacher that the bellcurve would make it to C5/c6/ d7‚Ä¶ i feel depressed that my effort all these years would lead me to a pathway that i would definitely not expect.,btohqsg
allergy to wheat sounds hella depressing,btohqsg
yes LOL but still forced to eat by teachers,btohqsg
there‚Äôs not much GF food in sg so its kinda hard to eat here,btohqsg
you focus on the past then ur just gonna be stuck there,btohqsg
keep ur chin up and move on,btohqsg
hi  great job on taking the courage to rant!! thats honestly an insane amount of work you put in,btohqsg
no one should tell you otherwise,btohqsg
This is how i spend my friday night,btohqsg
also your teacher is bullshitting about the moderation,btohqsg
only time will tell what happens next (quite literally too) and i wont tell you to keep your head up because thats probably difficult as balls rn  but your health is more important than an exam,btohqsg
do what you need to take care of yourself yeah,btohqsg

make u feel better ppl work more hours just to aim to pass,btohqsg
"sometimes as much as it sounds invalidating or dismissive you gotta learn to ignore what that teacher said to you. i have had teachers telling me im not good enough in any aspect and that definitely affected me especially because my fam used to say the same thing. not sure if youre taking o lvls now or alr finished o lvls but your prelims does not determine your actual final grades  if you know you put in the effort  you definitely will improvein terms of mental health i can understand the struggles  i completely ignored my mental health in sec sch because i had to numb it just to get thru school because it was a daily basis  there isnt even time to relax. same with jc  i can understand that its frustrating because i wish that i took care of my mental state so i wouldnt still be depressed or have anxiety through these past 8 years  im in uni now with only 3 days of sch so i have the time to choose when to take a breakyour feelings are valid and if this helps  this is what one of my friend told me""its not about trying to get rid of your mental health problems  its about learning to live in harmony with it""jiayou  u can do it",btohqsg

Chen made enough money last year from selling necklaces so he decides to flex his wealth on us this year by making us calculate how many solar panels he can afford,btohqsg
i did ignore his words at the start of sec 1. my maths teacher has taught me frm the beginning of sec sch and sometimes he might be too insensitive w his words and have short tempered too. even if i make the slightest mistake in class / didn‚Äôt fllw his method of doing the equation   he wld tore my ws / slam the table / broke my calculator / detect my marks during mock tests. it got so bad that it always gives me panic attack during his lessons so my mum eventually feedback to the year head and he did listen for a while. sec 1-2  i was doing well in my studies but in sec 3  due to demand in studies and emphasis on my health  he told me that i shld pay more attention to my studies than my health. i hv to do weekly medical appointments aft sch‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs curriculum time even aft sch hours so i explain to him abt my situation and he said that it was all excuses and excuses. he also said that he managed to achieve 90% distinction in his previous sec 4 class so he def expect 100% distinction on us too. and yes he was also keane‚Äôs amaths teacher,btohqsg
other than that  he was quite funny during other occasions,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like sometimes i feel worthless when all my other peers in class is achieving high  distinction,btohqsg
like imagine having a bad day and then it shits on you,btohqsg
im going to make a robot crow and shit on ppl head,btohqsg
and cambridge for making everyone so stress,btohqsg
i hv love and hats rs w them,btohqsg
