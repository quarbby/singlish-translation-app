who wants to sign themselves up for such torture,btohqsg
is it possible to do comp sci as a double major?,btohqsg
all my friends that i've met are all single major  just 1 double major in math,btohqsg
theres no such thing as student initiated double major?,btohqsg
i think double majors are quite flexible  but depends on the faculty in question whether they want to give to you or not,btohqsg
but usually double majors dont really increase employability right since the uni transcript doesnt show it,btohqsg
unless u explicitly state it in ur resume,btohqsg
also got to see whether can fit into your schedule plan  if not might need to overload or take extra sem,btohqsg
So there’s no way to guarantee a weird double major during uni application?,btohqsg
uni apps usually give a fixed choice only right,btohqsg
im not that worried for chem and comp sci double major. Heard ppl doing this,btohqsg
Looks like I have some emails to make,btohqsg
i asked them for 2 yrs whether i can do a student ddp comp sci and chem on admission,btohqsg
and they were like..... NO NO NO NO NO,btohqsg
maybe it's really physically impossible to complete within 5 years,btohqsg
ok but i'm not sure of the stand for a 2nd major,btohqsg
its a student ddp technically right,btohqsg
supposedly that has to be applied once 60-80MCs are completed,btohqsg
from what i see is like you can do modules towards that 2nd major  then beg the faculty to give it to you,btohqsg
Double major only applies for subjects that have overlapping modules right,btohqsg
or else how do ppl do chem main degree and comp sci double major,btohqsg
double major is not double degree LOL,btohqsg
That’s why I’m asking about double major,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
ppl said that abt BCME in JC like no life gg leisure time  but in the end nothing much,btohqsg
well you can try ba  i won't say it's impossible,btohqsg
i just say that it's agonising,btohqsg
agonising != impossible because many have done it,btohqsg
1.5 times that of single degree,btohqsg
i rly dk what to study,btohqsg
lol can't help you here  you yourself got to make the decision at the end of the day,btohqsg
u enjoying what u studyin tho?,btohqsg
Ye boi no ragrets even tho i get torn a new one every sem,btohqsg
Cause uni content is not easy,btohqsg
But uni is easier than Rick and Morty,btohqsg
HONESTLY U NEED A RLLY HIGH IQ,btohqsg
something something i forgot the rest,btohqsg
To be fair  😆😆😩😤you have to have a very high IQ 💯😏🤓😜to understand Rick and Morty.,btohqsg
😤😩💦❤️The humor 🤣😂👍👌is extremely subtle  👉👌😻and without a solid grasp ✊💪😫🍆💦of theoretical physics 👁😱😤👀most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.,btohqsg
Actually IDK about you I alr got cancer by posting the partial copypasta,btohqsg
It’s just intensity and number of certs you get XD,btohqsg
Double major 1 paper  double degree 2 paper,btohqsg
Double degree 5 years I think,btohqsg
5 years max covered under Tuition Grant  technically you can take as Long as you want just fees only.There are legends who finish in 4 anyway.,btohqsg
Apparently it's only if you wish to be considered for ABAS,btohqsg
Feelin cute  shall try for 3.5,btohqsg
OK time to try complete my ddp in 4.5,btohqsg
I just included it because I'm scared I cmi lol,btohqsg
after I took H3 chem I no longer have that huge of an interest in chem anymore,btohqsg
Isn't there chem in pharma science though,btohqsg
