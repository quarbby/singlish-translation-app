Not unless you haven’t changed in donkey years and drive through mud  grime and dead bodies,btohqsg
Unless your air filter just choked already,btohqsg

Just change during your scheduled maintenance,btohqsg
Or at least clean during oil change,btohqsg
You should change it….just that it won’t do much to your FC,btohqsg
It tends to hit most people really hard..,btohqsg

Giti is actually pretty good performance and value 👍🏼,btohqsg
Yup  long time brand since 1993.Their sport s1 & GTR3 model has very good review.https://www.tyrereviews.com/Tyre/Giti/GitiSport-S1.htm,btohqsg
If only they make rickshaw tyres too 🥴,btohqsg
How often should we pump our tires?,btohqsg
Ok. I gonna go pump it later. Hopefully I wont malu myself. First timer,btohqsg
Best to check everytime you pump petrol,btohqsg
Doesn’t hurt even if you pump 1 psi,btohqsg
Can i check at the petrol station?,btohqsg
You can invest in a tyre pressure monitor also,btohqsg
Ohh. Ok will look more into that,btohqsg
Where u bought with the free patching & rotation?,btohqsg
Every Sun morning 7AM. To ensure 2.5bar always. 😁,btohqsg
Don’t worry. As long as you don’t put it into the fuel tank can already,btohqsg
Before you go  in order not to hold up queue  check your manual or the metal sticker on recommended tyre pressures you need.,btohqsg
If you’re driving Alpina  remember to bring your key along to unlock the swee swee cover,btohqsg
And do help to coil back the tubing after use,btohqsg
Yes. Will return back to original form,btohqsg
Try not to use and just dump on floor/grassthen drive off hahahhaha,btohqsg
Ah Gar ah Gar can liao lah. No need to Stand By Air Pump standard,btohqsg
Hopefully wont have long queue. I might need some time to figure out how to use the pump,btohqsg
If your front and rears have different pressures then do front/front or rear/rear together. Don’t cuckoo run here run there many times to adjust 0.1bar pressure,btohqsg
i only check and pump when i remember,btohqsg
not very good habit i think,btohqsg
Should do every 3-4 petrol pumps,btohqsg
Usually 1 month it’ll drop to the cold psi alr,btohqsg
Yea. Mine has different pressure for the front and rear,btohqsg
I last time hardworking pump every petrol pump,btohqsg
Good to invest in handheld battery operated pump. Every 2 weeks or so  whip it out and pump first thing in the morning prior to starting your drive. :D,btohqsg
Your boss no loan u ah,btohqsg
Now is see FC drop I go Pump,btohqsg
A reckless race between a Lancer and a Scirocco results in a sad BMW X3 and a 2-hour jamA fake EVO and a VW Scirocco were caught on camera speeding along the CTE and overtaking other vehicles using the road shoulder. Unfortunately for one of the two idiots  one of them hit a BMW X3 in the process and went full turtle  causing a 2-hour long jam in its wake 😮‍💨Let's just say a real EVO would not have even bothered racing with a ROC 😂 - JCan we get a ❤️ if you agree?Read the full blog post here ⬇️➡️http://bit.ly/3wEEXJ4,btohqsg
fake evo HAHAHA what a clown,btohqsg
@HistoryofManthis one if you don’t feel bad I agree,btohqsg
LOL rocco play but zhao when accident wkwkwkwk,btohqsg
Could’ve avoided all this if the lancer just went in lane 2 LOL,btohqsg
Also not his fault the lancer crashed,btohqsg
How stupid do you have to be to drive that recklessly in so much traffic,btohqsg
why the BMW dont know how to brake lol,btohqsg
You know what someone once said? There’s only two things in this world that is infinite. Human stupidity and the universe. This smart man wasn’t so sure about the latter.,btohqsg
You’ll be surprised how dumb you become when adrenaline kicks in,btohqsg
What's worse than a stupid guy?,btohqsg
A stupid guy in a souped up car,btohqsg
I never feel bad for idiots who cause a jam  cause destruction to property and to reckless driving,btohqsg
I may be dumb but i’m not stupid,btohqsg
Stupid people dunno how to use ipads,btohqsg
x3 is all wheel drive ah? Why the driver like cant control after tio whack,btohqsg
Stupid ppl buy an iPad with 4 wheels,btohqsg
Honestly  going back to this  my view is that I don’t care what you do with yourself and your shit. You can kill yourself if you want  but don’t do stupid shit when other people are involved. Like man  I want to go home to my family.,btohqsg
Tesla say Tesla lah…why so many words?,btohqsg
oh shit BRO DONT EXPOSE ME,btohqsg
You want? Give me spare car  I whack you,btohqsg
I come out the person in the flipped car die alr,btohqsg
My first accident I was a potato,btohqsg
Takes someone to see shit to know how to react in shit man,btohqsg
Fast and Furious does not count.,btohqsg
I always told myself be calm and stop the car at all cost lah. Im always pre-empting stupid idiots all around me.. like I changing lane speed up High beam me for cutting in?? Jokes on them,btohqsg
Was THIS WHY PIE WAS SO JAMMED YTD THO,btohqsg
It’s very different when you’re in the moment,btohqsg
I RMB i in the tunnel NOT MOVING,btohqsg
The first time I spun out  I thought I was prepared for it...,btohqsg
No one lah  it was an empty mountain road  ownself hurt ownself.,btohqsg
the real stupidity is racing in somewhat heavy traffic,btohqsg
Car made it out unscratched but spinning out was quite an experience. First ever,btohqsg
After that  it got easier  but still. Not everyone can react properly in situations like that.,btohqsg
Racing with little traffic is still stupid.,btohqsg
Wait DID THE BMW CHANGE LANE WITHOUT SIGNALLING,btohqsg
yes but the heavy traffic made their alr stupid decision just pure dumb,btohqsg
the lane was clear for him if u ask me,btohqsg
the lancer never slow down even,btohqsg
All accidents are a serious of unfortunate minor events when combined  becomes a big one,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion  if the lancer had just whack and sideswiped the BMW  he wouldn’t lose control and flip and the BMW would only have one side of damage.,btohqsg
what’s it gotta do w the bmw tho,btohqsg
I saw the video. Lancer and BMW just both suay go 2nd lane tgt,btohqsg
Bmw like never signal lancer last min saw panic,btohqsg
The wouldn’t lose control is a big if seeing how he reacted  but better chance.,btohqsg
he had a lot of time to see,btohqsg
Bro  from the video  I can see the BMW do that for like a full 3 seconds at least...,btohqsg
Like ample time to react to it..,btohqsg
You can tell when a car wants to be a charlie bravo from far right?,btohqsg
Some idiots idk why like to drive on the lane markings,btohqsg
I just think everyone are a road hazard,btohqsg
it’s common knowledge that if you have ample time to slow down there won’t be an accident,btohqsg
Like cannot assume car is changing lane without signalling or what,btohqsg
Just treat them like they are.,btohqsg
Well expensive lesson for a lancer.. which is prolly stock.. no michelin tyres.. no suspension.. no good brakes,btohqsg
u don’t need michelins  suspension or good brakes to stop,btohqsg
you see a mentally handicapped child  you don't ask the parent how retarded is the kid,btohqsg
a stock car is supposed to stop as it is,btohqsg
That’s why he boss and I forever worker sir 😳,btohqsg
Lancer came from behind at that speed. ZERO DEFENSIVE DRIVING,btohqsg
I see a Smurf blue civic I pull to shoulder on hazard lights,btohqsg
to defend myself i always slow down to speed limit on lane 1,btohqsg
if they come too close i give finger,btohqsg
Xdrive  shld have Awd. S-drive 2WD.Such high CG  I would'veThank God for not flipping.🙏,btohqsg
xdrive usually on the top range models only,btohqsg
Most in Singapore of that gen are red because not the higher specs,btohqsg
"Look like an ""option"" for Xdrive",btohqsg
More common on the higher spec engines,btohqsg
The newest lci gen has it standard now,btohqsg
But the gen in the video  a lot were rwd,btohqsg
Car impound and license bye bye right,btohqsg
I also. I just don’t drive. MAXIMUM DEFENSIVE!!,btohqsg
Which gen is it? I trying not to look so many times leh. See I sad,btohqsg
That time this lady ask me if I want. After she explain  I runs,btohqsg
I like! But her voice a bit low and raspy leh.. like Mike Jagger like that.,btohqsg
I scared. She told me she works out that’s why her biceps bigger than mine,btohqsg

Subaru is the best!Almost all their car AWD👍,btohqsg
Most importantly  it didn't flip.If it's Vezel  a different story. Maybe flip and roll till YCK exit😆,btohqsg

But thanks for letting me know fc civic is thai 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Bro they more atas than us,btohqsg
many people say accord euro r jdm,btohqsg
I mean jdm means japan domestic model. But i think now the minimum requirement i guess is manufactured in Japan,btohqsg
Can't be anything with a jap car badge is jdm,btohqsg
or at least start as a model specifically for japan or be sold in japan at least,btohqsg
I think Kei cars are the only true jdm now,btohqsg
"Yeah. Most now are ""world"" cars",btohqsg
there's more American domestic cars now compared to anything else,btohqsg
because a lot of their brands aren't very global anymore,btohqsg

I rented a Porsche a few days back (more than 10 years old) and it suddenly broke down on the road... now company wants me to pay $3k to replace the radiator.Anyone have any suggestions as to what to I should do?Background story:- Prior to this   I have alerted the company multiple times when it was blinking the overheating signal and they told me to just add coolant/ignore the sign.-They have my deposit in cash,btohqsg
Haha was referring to the swift. Honda not so budget these days,btohqsg
Do you have proof of the lights flashing as you picked the car up?,btohqsg
And texts of you alerting them?,btohqsg
added according to their instructions haha,btohqsg
Your deposit how much and is the car still with you?,btohqsg
they gave me BMW as replacement car,btohqsg
then was towed to their workshop or sth,btohqsg
Alright  you can file a complaint after you return the bmw should they still hold your deposit,btohqsg
Just file a police complaint first if they withhold,btohqsg
Can consider speaking with a lawyer,btohqsg
just worry lawyer fees incur more,btohqsg
If you have proof of the issue existing when you picked up the car,btohqsg
Beyond imagination. Some of the depre can buy supercar,btohqsg
hmm it was blinking on day 2 or 3,btohqsg
Usually the judge will rule for your deposit and lawyer fees,btohqsg
Overseas.. our toyota altis is buy supercar in US sia,btohqsg
But you mentioned it to them,btohqsg
If they withhold  u can try filing with case or Small Claims cus its less than 10k,btohqsg
You had the car under your care,btohqsg
A coolant doesnt break down within a few days,btohqsg
Yes but the argument is that it was under his care when it happened,btohqsg
Coe paper enough to buy a few cars haha. Singaporeans all rich,btohqsg
Alot of millionaires leh  don’t play play,btohqsg
Aiya here you buy one house and one car,btohqsg

So this was my only option,btohqsg
My next car when I go back petrol i sure get,btohqsg
If u gna spend 450 on a bumper  top up and change whole bodykit liao,btohqsg
after changing rim and adding soundproof  my fuel consumption drop quite abit and now feel less power too😰,btohqsg
This ONE UR OWN DOING SIA,btohqsg
Ur rim how heavy? Sound proofing also add weight,btohqsg
not sure how heavy is the rim tho,btohqsg
More power u need do tuning or exhaust liao. Cold air intake wont boost much le,btohqsg
peer pressure...keep say my rim small need to upsize,btohqsg
Everything we do a power to weight ratio one,btohqsg
actually i like the air intake sound hahah,btohqsg
Cannot scold vulgar. $:&:@:@/$/)/$3739! My rim also ppl say small but mine alr 18 inch HAHHA,btohqsg

CAI without tune usually is very untapped power.,btohqsg

Hey guys  question. Has anyone ever tried Paint Protection Film (PPF)? How does it hold up in SG climate?,btohqsg
Exp and not worth. Just ceramic coating,btohqsg
My prev car has it (done by ex owner) when I pluck out the logo got the marks :)),btohqsg
There is only one outcome when you make car mod decisions listening to friends … 😬😬😬,btohqsg
No ah cold air intake haven do exhaust haven do,btohqsg
Today one of my fren just got caught on highway by lta,btohqsg
Depends on the quality you're going for and what you're protecting,btohqsg
If your paint is not too expensive and you don't really drive up north a lot,btohqsg
Exhaust ❎ non stock light cluster ❎ tint ❎,btohqsg
Can consider ceramic for basic protection and just repaint when you feel like you've picked up scratches,btohqsg
Will cost roughly the same as PPF,btohqsg
As good quality ppf is fairly expensive,btohqsg
If you go up north a fair bit  can consider ceramic all over and impact area ppf if your paint job is regular,btohqsg
Please don't buy cheap tyres or cheap wheels,btohqsg
just rim  the tyres shall remain,btohqsg
A wise man tell me leh: GO BIG OR GO HOME! 🏠,btohqsg
sure can fit in de la,btohqsg
You know those soft drink cups got lid?,btohqsg
@HistoryofManhe recommended me to a place,btohqsg
If you take a small lid and try to cover large cup  can or not?,btohqsg
Wheels and tyres  1 of the 2 things you should play play,btohqsg
Don’t be like pete by 13.70 pads..,btohqsg

I have an A3 8Y sedan. Car quite new  6 mths old  drove up to Melaka once. I did an IGL coating once before the Melaka trip. So the paint more or less new-ish.
