no blocks for the 9x bonus points,btohqsg
ahh okie okie sorry boss. have edited for clarity ü´°,btohqsg
Anyone can advise if I am getting cpf house loan  should I max the tenure to 25yrs or just 10yrs. As I am planing to sell it probably after 6-8yrsüòÖ,btohqsg
Max lah. Where can you find cheaper loan other than this. ü§£. Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Cause I was thinking if drag to the longest maybe can get the balance OA to invest to cover the loan interest. But I have the intension to sell my bto after MOP.,btohqsg
So don‚Äôt know shorter tenure better or longer oneüòÖ,btohqsg
How much eir is this promo ?,btohqsg
Based on the TnC  u get 3% of the NCD amount (min 10k; max 250k USD) from 31-May to 31-Aug.,btohqsg
Taking 3 months investing period  getting 3% would roughly be 12%pa,btohqsg
Agree. And if add 5.4%. p.a. on the moneybull. That's a 17.4% eir for this promo. Madness..,btohqsg
Then the qn‚Ä¶ need to convert to USD ah‚Ä¶ :/,btohqsg
No. Can be sgd equivalent value.Capped 250k usd. Aka 342 606 sgd.1usd  to 0.7296sgd,btohqsg
But this promo is not for every existing users right? Only selected ones,btohqsg
Sdic only 75k. Later webull runroad  also die.,btohqsg
Can check your Menu > Promotion Center (mine was the 4th box which needs to scroll left abit),btohqsg
Webull no sdic  sdic only for bank,btohqsg
I‚Äôve got only 3 boxes lol,btohqsg
U're right.. no sdic. Only mas regulated. Anyone knows how to assess the risk if they will run road ?,btohqsg
Can you click the TnC n read? I suspect the 3% is per year. Means your max return is 8.4% per year only.Mine one shows like this.,btohqsg
Their custodian bank is Dbs  so by right even if webull go under  your money is still safe with Dbs,btohqsg
They gave example here‚Ä¶ 3% of the NCD is the ‚Äògift‚Äô‚Ä¶ no per annum here,btohqsg
Ya. Mine is different n cap at 8.4% per year.,btohqsg
Really... Cos I tot if they go under. Even my money in dbs will be frozen for them to settle their debts. Might not get back full sum. Am I right.. ?,btohqsg
From my understanding the fact that webull is regulated with MAS  and their custodian bank is Dbs  means that your money is safe. But  having said that  there is still a risk of losing money with money market funds. Safest place will be SSB now.,btohqsg
Those monies dont belong to webull in the first place if they are under custodian,btohqsg
The 3% ncd is already 12% guaranteed. Unlikely to lose ssb,btohqsg
Put it in this way  if I had this promo available I would go in big :),btohqsg
Not everyone have 360k liquid cash to spare haha,btohqsg
Hit and run. Pool whole village(relative) fund in. NFA üòÇ,btohqsg
Any special access code for chocolate finance?,btohqsg
Anyone subscribing to Moneybull in USD  they are switching fund...,btohqsg
I clicked not now just now as I was busy. Now can't find the option for me to switch or not now switch liao.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Just to confirm can subscribe to moneybull sgd too right?,btohqsg
I've also applied this card. Doubt the service is free. The card already has no annual fee  don't think it is that good to be providing free service.Edit: guess I was wrong... It should be free.https://milelion.com/2017/02/28/can-the-visa-infinite-concierge-deliver/,btohqsg
VISA platinum has a concierge service too.,btohqsg
Also if there is fraud  custodised assets might not be safe.,btohqsg
Best example in recent times is ftx. Such a ‚Äúbig‚Äù firm. Custodise crypto with them. They died with fraud. Investors didn‚Äôt get back their crypto in full.,btohqsg
