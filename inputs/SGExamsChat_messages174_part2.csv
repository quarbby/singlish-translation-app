I got like 273.2 pretty sure it’s wrong tho lol,btohqsg
I sit there for 15 mins crying HAHAHA cause idk whether correct,btohqsg
I drew an extra triangle at the bottom,btohqsg
But I think I should be able to get 1 mark for method for bearing at least,btohqsg
how did yall do the graph qn part b,btohqsg
But the x degree questions so may steps,btohqsg
I got that in the end. 2x is the other one,btohqsg
den second one i put 2x,btohqsg
But I forgot times 5 for matrice,btohqsg
chop chop i oni need answer sheet for my last qns,btohqsg
Sure ok my friends say need,btohqsg
its alr said in 1weekif u times 5 its wrong alr,btohqsg
They alr state thats total for a week,btohqsg
Paper was quite easy I felt,btohqsg
same i minus so many marks alrd,btohqsg
Got a sneaky suspicion i messed up the cone,btohqsg
Percentage can leave in mixed number right,btohqsg
arent u supposed to times 5 to the sum,btohqsg
Good cos I put 21 with some mix number I forgot,btohqsg
Yea I got this it was 21.97 at first then I round up,btohqsg
But they tab for u no?,btohqsg
I need to go for ear cleansing,btohqsg
i didnt know u cld study for lc,btohqsg
But if I leave in exact with mix number should be no problem right,btohqsg
Go to YouTube and listen to Aussie accent,btohqsg
ngl the ascent and way of talking irritates me,btohqsg
Then u write down what they say,btohqsg
It's okay Singlish accent probably irritates them too,btohqsg
Cos mixed number makes it exact,btohqsg
So I round up to 22.0,btohqsg
I thought part 1c the denominator need expand since it said simplify,btohqsg
I think I got full marks except for 1e,btohqsg
Last one they asked in sgd though,btohqsg
Hmm my teacher said supposed to expand but wouldn’t penalise if don’t,btohqsg
omg are u having a stroke,btohqsg
ay guys anyone got soft copy,btohqsg
d last one didn’t they ask it for sgd,btohqsg
But if you actually got all correct then congrats,btohqsg
Then how y’all find d conversion rate,btohqsg
i think u'll get the marks,btohqsg
Cos how u know graph will follow d trend,btohqsg
And u need to be cautious,btohqsg
"i use the worse rate and say ""it's better to play safe cause the exchange rate is unpredictable """,btohqsg
i mean if it's logical i think u'll get the marks,btohqsg
but that part oni 2 marks so idt it matters much,btohqsg
how did u find median when thrs 2 years while u only go for 1,btohqsg
Probably need 95 to get A1,btohqsg
Nope do well in paper 1 means A1 already since everyone slips at it!,btohqsg
