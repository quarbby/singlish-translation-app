Once u found which bhg carry neckerman. Maybe u can ask which outlets,btohqsg
Cos this brand not all bhg have,btohqsg
Yeah not many. Mostly trekking de sandals 😅,btohqsg

Nope I’m not particularly attracted to their designs 😅,btohqsg
I find the birkenstock ones ok,btohqsg
Ok but the prices too steep,btohqsg
Thats y i bought overseas 🤣,btohqsg
Or u try their other ranges which is cheaper and got many colours,btohqsg
oh jurong point have that new big big shop sell branded stuffs,btohqsg
Like silicon type right.  I got the brown de,btohqsg
I ever read that the fit is better than NM & more durable. But if you are not going to wear on a long term basis  then you can probably try NM. My Madrid lasted me for many many years.,btohqsg
But at way cheaper price right,btohqsg
Last time yes…i find it ok but all slippers after a while of wearing will be slippery.,btohqsg
Aiyo then like that not very safe 😅,btohqsg
brand for less ! That’s the shop name !,btohqsg
I wear my current slippers half year or more le.. anti slip,btohqsg
and more lightweight than their cork counterparts,btohqsg
Yes. For me i cannot wear the design u shown. Coz it’s the way i walked  i think i didn’t lift my feet higher when i walk so i tripped myself a few times by the front part of the slippers,btohqsg
Hmm okay will take note 😁,btohqsg
I used to be walk like u. Dragging my feet when walk till i keep fell dwn once or twice in a mth then learnt my lesson 😁,btohqsg
Now i am wearing crocs slippers and then same thing happen a few times. Guess i am not born to wear atas slippers…better buy back 2 for $30 type,btohqsg
I don’t like to drag my feet,btohqsg
Like that you cannot wear sliders,btohqsg
I dislike people walking with the piak piak sound,btohqsg
So i trained myself to walk silently,btohqsg
Last time i wear de. Comfy,btohqsg
I have this too until i almost fall.,btohqsg
I don’t trust myself wearing this 😂😂,btohqsg
So comfy.. y u all dont like,btohqsg
This is ok but it hurt my skin,btohqsg
Finally got ppl  agree with me 😁,btohqsg
No I’ll trip and it will slip out when I walk,btohqsg
How will it slip out? I dont uds,btohqsg
Because our feet is not flat & the arches makes it comfy for walking,btohqsg
You need those with toe grip lol,btohqsg
Now u say it.. i uds 😁,btohqsg
Then it’s better u wear sandals,btohqsg
It’s comfy but when the front part almost trip me  it’s dangerous liao,btohqsg
It’s the colour that attracted me to buy.,btohqsg
They opened for a while in sg and then closed,btohqsg
Now i wearing no brand de. Its the clothing shop own manufacturing slippers. I love their slippers sia..anti slip.. $20 wear more than half a year,btohqsg
Nowadays i cannot wear such sandals.. sad,btohqsg
