Sector performance by different time frame,btohqsg
Recently plenty of focus on ESG.H2G any BBs keen?,btohqsg
Will there be another 60 to 100% daily gain counter today. Hope so.Hope to spot it if so too,btohqsg
This year alone controlling insider have been buying enviro-hub shares from open market- $0.071  $0.051  $0.050  $0.044With Medtecs big reversal from the bottom  i believe more and more counters who are already too cheap at the bottom will follow up.Enviro-hub is is gloves  green  clean renewable business which seems to the top focus this period.Since an insider is willing to buy $0.071 just in 2022  BBs should have no problem to play up 20 - 25 pips from current $0.049.Calling all BBs to watch this.$0.051 is the key to unlock,btohqsg
For 50% gain counter  Enviro-hub has potential to be picked,btohqsg
For the same reasons as medtecs   fell without much real selling to super Low prices  mainly just in illiquid resting stage thatâ€™s why medtecs can run up so easily yesteday,btohqsg
Judging all angles  enviro-hub I believe in time will be played  and become one of the more popular counters.,btohqsg
Stuckies for enviro-hub are mainly at $0.08x to $0.1x which is a good 30 + pips away from current price.,btohqsg
Reason for focus on similar type counters is usually pattern can repeat . Medtecs players can rotate to others,btohqsg
I believe fake seller. Donâ€™t think anyone have real incentive to sell here. This player thinks no retailers will dare to Makan him? Letâ€™s see,btohqsg
again US future keep gg up,btohqsg
Hmm only mt gap up. Riverstone gap down?,btohqsg
who is gonna give 75 pips today ?,btohqsg
Eindec can easily do 75 pips if BB wants to play it,btohqsg
Ug glove also can give many pips,btohqsg
I think eindec lighter than UG,btohqsg
But most likely BB will play UG rather than eindec because UG is more related to medtec,btohqsg
Craig Kennedyhas been banned! Reason:CAS ban.,btohqsg
Wow LS 2 is having second round or is it a retailer trap?,btohqsg
