She already has a valid HFE...,btohqsg
After the approval due to some family issues   he has to quit his job and decide to do grab for time being cause his past job needs to work until 12.30am but reach home at roughly 2 am and it's hard for him to manage his time to take care of my girl as I need to regularly go for checkup at the hospital .,btohqsg
My personal opinion -1) is the new income higher or lower than what was assessed in your existing HFE2) are you looking at higher grant or higher loan3) likelihood of your husband getting a new job that pays the same or higher than before?Other alternatives instead of quitting job?Change to part time? Take no pay leave?4) other ways of financing BTO during key collection if not relying on loan? CPF? Cash?,btohqsg
Yupyup  agree with this. If its more beneficial for a review then you can reach out to HDB for further assistance.I know of people who updated their HFE (still valid  ahead of expiry) before they get a resale since they could a higher loan which they prefer.,btohqsg
Plus  if she apply for October launch  BTO completion is few years laterPretty much how confident they are in getting a new job that pays same or higher and/or repaying the loan  assuming amount eligible is higher in existing HFE,btohqsg
But also  in case income lower than previous  HDB might or might not revise loan amount downward  so have to also consider how else to finance the flat or apply for a unit based on what they can afford more comfortably nowBasically  don't let $$$ become the cause of arguments and quarrels in the future,btohqsg
Maybe another consideration is -Say  apply for new HFE in September  the income documents submitted required are probably August 2023 until July 2024If husband is still in the current job in July  will be like not much difference than the financial situation assessed for existing HFE  unless there is pay cut?,btohqsg
Ok thanks so much guys .,btohqsg
Hope things gonna turn out fine for you!,btohqsg
hy how about woodgrove edge track  anyone?,btohqsg
Can a 4K house hold income get a 4room flat in non mature ?,btohqsg
I don't think is calculate like that... Should be looking at income ceilingWho knows  the 4k household is rich in cash savings leh?,btohqsg
If say cash n cpf have saving but monthy income 4K can get a 4 room bto in a non mature ?,btohqsg
Don't really understand your question...You can read the website and see if you are eligible to apply for the BTOIn terms of payment  ask yourself whether you can affordCost of BTO - grant - CPF - loan = any balance  you pay in cash,btohqsg
I mean  even the cheapest 2R will cost more than 4kWhether you can afford the BTO of your preference also depends on your own financial planning,btohqsg
If you are intending to apply based on Mature / Non Mature  you should apply in the current June exercise that is ending in 2 daysNext BTO exercise in October will be based on Standard / Plus / Prime model,btohqsg
Perhaps you wanna read up this reference by HDB@botcamoüëáüèºAdditionally  your HFE should indicate if you're eligible to buy 3 room or 4 room flat.,btohqsg
Planning to purchase a new home at the June sales launch?Work out your housing budget with HDB‚Äôs online calculators athttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg.,btohqsg
HFE will show you total HDB loan+ grant amountJust take it HDB loan won't increase on key collectionDo your maths,btohqsg
BTO are going up on every BTO exercise,btohqsg
Hi just wondering  HDB loan won't increase means they won't reassess our income anymore?,btohqsg
I heard they will assess ur income nearer to key collection  but its only to check if u are able to pay off  if not they'll decrease loan but not increase,btohqsg
Thanks! Cause I heard alot of different info from different people. Some say need reach out to HDB officers directly so they will reassess if not they won't do it anymore,btohqsg
If don't reassess it will be stressful though  means based on 1 income 1 student (for my case),btohqsg
It's case by case based not 100% will increase loanHDB don't want people to plan base on future salary,btohqsg
Then if they decrease loan the grant will up ?,btohqsg
Look at the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
Im not sure but we shld just assume worse case  but best to just ask hdb directly,btohqsg
Aw... so much has changed   isn't this at disadvantaged for students. But government kept encouraging us to apply BTO,btohqsg
Gov also encourage birth rate but yet so hard to get btoüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
"Deferred income assessment is only if both parties are students/ very fresh grads (within 12 months)/ NS men. If only 1 they won't allow. I tried to call and check before :"")",btohqsg
So is it for the updated scheme Grants and loans will be assessed nearing BTO key collection period??Previously was give grant first  then loan nearing key collection then assess.,btohqsg
üò™ then how to afford bto,btohqsg
HLE and HFE is different.You need HFE to buy BTO and resale. HFE gives you the grant and loan amount. It doesn't change  only decreases. The rest is appeal basis.,btohqsg
Use the budget calculator for a prudent decision. If not do the preliminary check. You'll get a good reality check on what you can afford!,btohqsg
Nope grant is given before the 2nd appt (signing of lease) so that any grant you get will be used to offset your down payment amount,btohqsg
So on the 2appt they will check increase or decrease the grant based on monlyhy income,btohqsg
Nope. Loan and grant are assessed and fixed during HFE,btohqsg
They will just disburse the grant before the 2nd appt so that it's in your CPF to be used during 2nd appt,btohqsg
Ya this is the scary part because means is based on our lower income when we applied?,btohqsg
Then technically we will earn more 4 years later,btohqsg
Then if we apply hfe then behind monlthy income drop,btohqsg
Do you qualify for deferred assessment?,btohqsg
nope. if your income increase  they can reassess for loan only but you have to forgo your grant.,btohqsg
If eligible  you would have received the grant in your CPF OA before your second appointment,btohqsg
If lower income  grant would be higher and loan lowerHDB doesn't ask applicants to return the grant when their income increases too,btohqsg
My viewpoint is HFE = HLE + grant etc assessed and made known to applicant all at oncePeople also needed HLE when applying for BTO before HFE was implementedHLE = housing loan eligibility  only for the loan partGrant is like a separate letter of sort,btohqsg
Deferred assessment is not newThere is even lower % deposit or something for staggered payment scheme nowHLE era -1) apply HLE2) income assessment for grantFlat selection somewhere here??3) grant is credited into CPF OA4) sign lease  pay deposit5) HDB renews or reassess HLE when nearer key collectionIncome no change or higher - no change to loan amount eligibleIncome decrease - HLE reassessed and may be revised downward,btohqsg
Thanks for the info guys :),btohqsg
get grant 20000.mean is lower income?,btohqsg
