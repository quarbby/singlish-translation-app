got dude called that in my squad also hahaha,btohqsg
Its always the indian fella with the darkest skin call ahneh,btohqsg
You should make it free of charge,btohqsg
I plan to at most introduce FAS,btohqsg
For every 5 paying students  1 student gets to attend classes for free,btohqsg
Just that it wasn’t called SGExams,btohqsg
But SGExams has broken off with that tuition centre,btohqsg
can i ask why the ns portal everyday maintenacne one,btohqsg
Bro thats ur biggest concern ?,btohqsg
eh nvr heard that tuition centre b4,btohqsg
Its been 1month plus my emart still havnt set up,btohqsg
How am i supposed to get my socks,btohqsg
SGExams and another place set it up,btohqsg
Cause the community raised concerns of some kind,btohqsg
It was a problem to begin with,btohqsg
Who is the community and what concerns they raised  I dunno,btohqsg
Its still a for profit in the end,btohqsg
The only thing that echoes what SGExams believes in is a volunteer for tuition scheme,btohqsg
Whereby there shldnt be charges at all,btohqsg
Is possible to achieve this  and idm doin it tbh. Prob gonna do it in uni alao,btohqsg
It would be cool to have a big volunteer tuition organisation,btohqsg
The for profit and no profit shld have a distinct line,btohqsg
Thats a qn no one has ever answered,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the link :),btohqsg
I don’t know any big ones,btohqsg
Heartware Tuition ProgrammeFor children  whose parents are incarcerated or from low-income backgrounds  keeping up with their academics is an uphill battle. The motivation to learn wanes rapidly with the lack of positive role models in their lives. The Heartware Tuition Programme aims to place these children on equal footing with their peers through free weekly tuition  driven by youth volunteers from tertiary institutions.,btohqsg
Theres some that volunteer at teban areas for the poor and needy,btohqsg
Tuition industry needs a culling in sg,btohqsg
And they have mini group excursions,btohqsg
Tbh the only culling it needs,btohqsg
Tuition culture in SG is a bit too much,btohqsg
It’s nice to want to learn,btohqsg
It’s not nice to basically be forced to learn,btohqsg
Thats why no one shld be forced,btohqsg
It doesnt encourage self understanding/ research/ inquisitiveness,btohqsg
I went thru tuition and i loved math at a certain point in time from hating it,btohqsg
Tuition for many feels like a necessity,btohqsg
We need to cull the tutors,btohqsg
Like ‘I can’t do well in maths if I don’t get tuition’,btohqsg
I still feel is cost that is an issue,btohqsg
Its not... its just theres too many of them,btohqsg
I see schs like CJC chem department,btohqsg
Too little and it will become a monopoly,btohqsg
Giving only 2 qns for acid base equilibrium tutorial,btohqsg
Wtf  might as well not have tutorial,btohqsg
So your solution is not to fix those departments but to introduce essentially private schools that students can turn to,btohqsg
Its an avenue for additional learning resources,btohqsg
And if i were to fix those departmentsHow long will i take to get there,btohqsg
Why not run smth like khans academy then,btohqsg
Public schools should provide the full extent of any learning material most kids will need,btohqsg
