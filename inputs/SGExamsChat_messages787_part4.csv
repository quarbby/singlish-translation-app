I tot only the number of mc,btohqsg
Yala 4AU instead of normal 3 lor,btohqsg
i dont think NUS students do 3AU mods,btohqsg
I calculated if i get 65% avg for the other 60% of the module  i need a 21/40 computed to whatever marks the paper carry to get 60% overall,btohqsg
their mods usually 4AUs one or 4MCs,btohqsg
Walao half my time is just doing maths to see how efficiently I can fit 4AU and 3AU mods into my 12AU SU quota,btohqsg
y1 need to pass all 3h2???,btohqsg
only guy I ‘know’ from MI is prob in poly or some shit I assume,btohqsg
If i get B+ for econs and B for coding,btohqsg
Maybe it will do my cCAP good,btohqsg
it has always been 2h2 passes only for my time,btohqsg
Anyway the results gonna be out on 3rd june,btohqsg
What is the chances of failing this mod,btohqsg
why do people go to mi,btohqsg
what is the mean and variance,btohqsg
because ijc didnt offer me double science,btohqsg
because my ass took combined science,btohqsg
there probably was an alternate universe where I went there,btohqsg
thank god I’m in this dimension,btohqsg
i mean MI is really not a terrible school in all honesty,btohqsg
i dont find much of anything to complain about,btohqsg
If its a C+ and D+ probably can scrap by assuming the rest is A- or B+,btohqsg
I thought mi was the ite of jcs,btohqsg
The C range is 2.5 and the D range is 2 right,btohqsg
C+ is 2.5 and D+ is 1.5?,btohqsg
Neh i dun think i can get A-,btohqsg
Its literally in the name it was the old CI thing,btohqsg
Wait i tot D is 2,btohqsg
my old math teacher : the only difference between you guys and RI is only one letter,btohqsg
is it NUS using different gpa scoring whatdafag,btohqsg
NTU is 3 letters and there are 3 different NTUs all universities and are quite decent for all,btohqsg
no longer in MI already  he was called Tan Kwok Wai,btohqsg
D is 1  D+ is 1.5,btohqsg
or maybe he retire already  cant seem to find any updates on him,btohqsg
i remember there is a tan something when i joined year 1  and he looks quite old,btohqsg
Ok la my other stuff is 39/60,btohqsg
Can be this paper i score <11/40,btohqsg
As long as your average is C+ to B- then u can stay,btohqsg
Cant let this sem drop cap by < 0.18,btohqsg
Yala that one should be 3,btohqsg
C+ can keep above 3 meh,btohqsg
What is the grade of C+ C and C- ah,btohqsg
The 0.18 should be able to tank that assuming u didn't overload this sem,btohqsg
I hope my other 60% of the module did sufficiently ok to keep be 60% overall (if i surprisingly pass my paper tdy),btohqsg
Yea i take 5mc this sem,btohqsg
If i can get abuv that for some mod  will it still be able to tank a C/C-,btohqsg
I gotta get a A- average for me if not my GPA will tank,btohqsg
words i will never ever speak,btohqsg
I need to maintain a B average if not my GPA will tank...,btohqsg
I wish A+ would grant like offsets..,btohqsg
