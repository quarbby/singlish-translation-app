Call in to UOB to change statement month to match calendar month,btohqsg
For Snack  I have top up $4000 investment fund  and started all the challenges. Do I need to hold the position till end of the challenge? The challenge days left 28 days.,btohqsg
Or any action I missed out?,btohqsg
Did you check the TnC when the earmark shall be happened?,btohqsg
yes 4mpd capped for $1k spend posted in statement month,btohqsg
Hi when using uob ladys with travel selected as category and paying flight tickets in foreign currency. Would you link with amaze and pay using amaze or use ladys card straight? From my understanding through amaze will not get the 6mpd for uob right?,btohqsg
Hi when will the webull moneybull $3000usd cash voucher be credited?,btohqsg
Or is amaze*transit for transport only?,btohqsg
My CPF Amount Reserved increased from 26xxx to 27xxx  so it is 1xxx increase; where does this number come from? My SA interest in 2023 is much higher than 1xxx  and I did not do RSTU in 2023.,btohqsg
RSTU money and the interests earned from those are supposedly ringfenced.0.04 * 26k ~= 1k which sounds about right,btohqsg
Hi  i am planning to buy an iphone. Which category of uob lady's card should i should to get the 6mpd?,btohqsg
Wah.. so which card is the best for apple store purchase?,btohqsg
oh thanks  I thought it is the whole SA amount of 4%,btohqsg
Which cards u have ? üòÇ,btohqsg
The amounts reserved should be RSTU + interests earned. Does the number roughly makes sense given your history of RSTU?,btohqsg
Buy from Krisshop  with travel category,btohqsg
depends on how you are getting the phone. ishopChangi or krisshop then UOB Lady's Travel. Full sticker price. Check out milelion's article,btohqsg
yes for my 26xxx amount reserved,btohqsg
I am getting directly from apple online store,btohqsg
I have uob lady's  priv miles and uob amex,btohqsg
You are right. For the December promo  the earmark only commences on 31 Jan 2024. No wonder.,btohqsg
travel.. if you buy from krisshop,btohqsg
How to know the amount of rstu and its corresponding interest that are ringfenced if I have more than $40k in SA?,btohqsg
U can try the other recommendation but I didn‚Äôt try it before.,btohqsg
this one very dangerous with people reporting it gets converted to offline transaction.safest would be Amaze+CRMC but $1k aint enough.i have no suggestion for apple online store other than SCB Manhattan for 3% cashback,btohqsg
Your earned interests from RSTU will be reserved by default.,btohqsg
Oh ok... in that case i use uob cashback since it has no cap,btohqsg
uob cashback has no cap??which one?!,btohqsg
U can go down to the physical Apple Store to split ur payments into multiple cards,btohqsg
I think he‚Äôs referring to the uob absolute Amex,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have reached basic health care sum in 2023. May I ask why does my medisave today on 1 Jan 2024 doesn't show the new basic health care sum? Haha all my medisave interest went into SA,btohqsg
As intended. You can now VCMA 3k.,btohqsg
this is the logic cos interest is credited 31 dec. as bhs only increases 1 jan  the interest goes into sa instead,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Amex 1.7% cashback.. quite low leh,btohqsg
Just check my spouse's amount reserved stays the same  in 2023 =  $64xxx and 2024 also $64xxx ($0 difference)  only 8K MA top-up and no RSTU in 2023,btohqsg
then maybe should call in and check with CPF.Alternatively theres a 1M65 chat group which has helpful admins that may know more,btohqsg
Reserved or total SA? It's 2 different things.,btohqsg
For amount in CPF SA that can be used for investment  it needs to be the excess of $40K of the SA. Does this 40K also include the reserved amount from RSTU or not?,btohqsg
Reserved amount even if more than 40K cannot be used for anything other than CPF Life.,btohqsg
Yes  this one  no change in 2023 and 2024,btohqsg
No choice.. other cards have cap,btohqsg
Hi guys  I probably may have heard or seen about this in one of Chris‚Äôs video  but just checking again.For HSBC EGA+ deposit $2000 requirement  do I also have to maintain that in that account or just have a deposit transaction statement of $2000 to qualify that requirement?My intention is to transfer out that $2000 immediately after that.,btohqsg
Then have to check with CPF already. If never increase sounds like never receive interest lol.,btohqsg
Can withdraw immediately. Once you qualify for Everyday+ rewards  you should receive an SMS from HSBC,btohqsg
there is SA interest on 31 Dec,btohqsg
HSBCSG(1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31JAN2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on your HSBC card spends and GIRO bill,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification with example!,btohqsg
Hi when will the webull moneybull $3000usd cash voucher be credited?,btohqsg
I think I recall the tnc said by 5 Jan  according to what I noted down in my notes,btohqsg
