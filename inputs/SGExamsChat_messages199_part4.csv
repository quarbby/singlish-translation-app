suck it up i always tell myself,btohqsg
But its such attitude that limits change ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
So you cannot excuse that so i assume you also cannot excuse police brutality is that right,btohqsg
Maybe go strt a campaign or smth,btohqsg
But because of wage gap women continue to complain and say law is biased against them. Wage gap is not a law  wage gap is just the corporates are sexist  not the government,btohqsg
but i am honeslty seeing alot of,btohqsg
Didnt they prove that wage gap doesnt exist,btohqsg
Its more of an earning gap,btohqsg
Like women choose lower pay proffessions,btohqsg
in the form of plenty charities,btohqsg
whenever i go on sg chatrooms and there's gender issues its just men whining the shit off abouit women,btohqsg
and you tell me singapore isnt misogynistic,btohqsg
honestly anywhere else is pro male,btohqsg
There is a huge difference between wanting mens rights and dismissing womens rights,btohqsg
and its not even that bad here la,btohqsg
have u ever been on r/singapore or hardwarezone,btohqsg
i think alot ppl got good intent but dk how express,btohqsg
I dont see anyone in this chat saying things like 'women belong in the kitchen' or shit like that,btohqsg
they all bash women super hardcore,btohqsg
I tink r/singapore is nt that bad,btohqsg
r/singapore whenever it comes to gendered issue become r/incel,btohqsg
holy shit its on 99 % of sports pages,btohqsg
I heard hwz is horrendous but i rarely see anyth from r/sg,btohqsg
seriously idk if im in a country subreddit or just fucking trp or r/braincels,btohqsg
i think everyone need to put others first,btohqsg
I like how this chat can be split on biden and trump or hk and china but agree that we need mens rights in sg,btohqsg
I love Singapore being a democracy but the constitution is semi-dictatorship,btohqsg
Shows the good in both sides at least,btohqsg
At least we agree on local issues,btohqsg
sometimes sg is a fking blessing,btohqsg
Any of yall think lgbt gonna be legalised here anytime soon,btohqsg
Even if they repeal 377a the fight doesnt stop there,btohqsg
Y r we talking about politics in exam grp chat though HAHAHHA,btohqsg
just go *ck ur boyf/gf la sg govt dont care,btohqsg
cuz this chat is 90% male,btohqsg
Like if im not wrong they dont recognize gay or les marriages,btohqsg
tbh biden v trump aint a gneder thing,btohqsg
Maybe. Since Pope Francis says it's ok  I think Singapore Catholic Chruch may change their opinion on it too,btohqsg
I keep failing cos of my Authoritarian Left views,btohqsg
Do the catholics have that much impavt in sg,btohqsg
im auth right but i usually write in a center left view,btohqsg
No but the LGBTQ laws are only there to appease the religions,btohqsg
Nah man  pope has hidden agenda legitimately speaking in my opinion. How many lgbt lives can be converted to christianity just because he said yes,btohqsg
Is auth left smtg like far left,btohqsg
didnt say it was  more of a liberal vs white nationalist thing  and you guys aint white so idk why there's people supporting trump,btohqsg
yeah but ig i thought thats whayt u said soz,btohqsg
There's far left  centre left etc,btohqsg
Yea but he said it. If its true then got a chance. Wouldnt it be ironic if a man of god lies in order to selfishly benefit,btohqsg
left right is economic policy  auth lib is social policy i think,btohqsg
So i was a bit confused to hear it as an adjective,btohqsg
