yes  jc econs is just write until hand pain without actually understanding,btohqsg
sounds like my ss and hist sadge,btohqsg
lowkey though  its one of the subjects where your results is proportional to your effort,btohqsg
you dont have to understand anything to do well,btohqsg
my breakfast go to is just,btohqsg
actually iestin can send the qm1 one,btohqsg
i stopped halfway through that mod bc covid,btohqsg
but a lot of ppl take econs as h1 so to some of them not worth the effort lol,btohqsg
especially now as we are switching to 70 rp system,btohqsg
i used econs as a form of escapism from my sciences tho :(((,btohqsg
now even more not worth effort,btohqsg
im still doing this in uni 🤣,btohqsg
cause i eee + econs lol,btohqsg
oh my i did this last sem,btohqsg
wah i actually really return all my knowledge back to the uni every sem  i dont even remember how to get eigenvectors anymore,btohqsg

sorry i cant teach you how to get A for PW :(,btohqsg

I have exactly that in my class,btohqsg

if they dont sit properly we kena drop 🤡,btohqsg
"this is true because their PT is for ""maintain fitness"" purpose",btohqsg
it's funny how during PT can do push ups but punishment cannot do push ups,btohqsg
pes c casually do 20 pull ups 🤡,btohqsg
im already here  how now 🤡,btohqsg
only sg uni mods r focused on grp projects,btohqsg

ironically trying to study for cc7 for the stupid individual quiz,btohqsg
lol funnily cc mods pull me up previous sem,btohqsg

some Bs cough ml4 piece of shit cough,btohqsg
I got A- for CC1 and some NBS CC mod,btohqsg
i really thought i wrote p well for cc1 sia,btohqsg

It was only my first sem and i got A and A+ for both cc mods 🤣,btohqsg
my cc1 prof scolded me for my low effort draft,btohqsg
cc1 ok la kinda expected cause tutor constantly gave me good feedback  but cc2 ??? lol,btohqsg
i submitted that same draft for the first graded assignment tbh,btohqsg
the intakes before me they did wp,btohqsg
Hi everyone I'm q curiousDid any J2/J1 here actually subscribe for sugaresque teaching,btohqsg
i heard someone say its useless,btohqsg
and she j talks about her day in class,btohqsg
i swear it was someone in this chat,btohqsg
she has my respect the same way brad goh does,btohqsg
love her or hate her u driving her engagement,btohqsg
and i got reason to believe brad goh might be doing it satirically or at least self aware of his image,btohqsg
I kinda just wanna figure out her business model,btohqsg
have a cultlike following of secondary sch girls and j1/j2 girls idolising u,btohqsg
and after u finish jc u realise shes not all that cracked up to be,btohqsg
i mean yea shes smart as hell but she sensationalises her life so much,btohqsg
to some extent most of us (jc kids) experience her life albeit less intensely,btohqsg
so the things she posts start looking a bit tryhard and fluff,btohqsg
and honestly i would take a leaf out of her book and be a tiktoker,btohqsg
but im objectively too ugly for that,btohqsg
study for 11 hrs a day (realistic),btohqsg
i just dont brag abt it,btohqsg
why got some fucking downie in psq saying its not,btohqsg
ok its my fault for even commenting in psq,btohqsg
its not uncommon for jc kids to mug 11 hrs a day,btohqsg
but i dont think it shld be sensationalised,btohqsg
shes like chloe liem but minus the satire,btohqsg
im not trying to be a hater,btohqsg
like that my gf 50/10 alr,btohqsg
At least back in ej thr was no one studying 11h,btohqsg
it's enough to get a ton of simps,btohqsg
meanwhile me sleeping for 2 hours,btohqsg
No but why do people go to sugaresque when it's not that effective,btohqsg
"Like I was reading her ""model essay"" today that she provided1. She literally truncated the qn to make it easier by removing the key word from the qn2. Her essay was largely plagiarized from other platforms",btohqsg
from what zl said  she was a fan and believed sugaresque would legit help lol,btohqsg
yea but people who need help won't look too much into it,btohqsg
or those that are a fan,btohqsg
The arts are nothing more than a luxury. Is this true in your society?,btohqsg
"She went through the lesson without the ""in your society""",btohqsg
Which literally makes the essay 10 times easier,btohqsg
She selling a essay writing package for $789,btohqsg
Idek how she got that price,btohqsg
the older i get the more i see how insane people are,btohqsg
If u need to pay $789 for an A for gp u are doing smth wrong,btohqsg
like this i agree im not,btohqsg
Someone replied to my email that I sent them on 16th December yesterday,btohqsg
They didn't even answer whatever I asked them,btohqsg

My sis was shitting on me abt how ex my tuition is then I'm like,btohqsg

my stipend comes from his funding bro,btohqsg

n my chest hurts and i cant do anything,btohqsg
300 was ok for me dk why now cant,btohqsg
Ans they always up their price during a levels period,btohqsg
My friend one hit 1.2k per month for econs tuition not even guaranteed an A for econs,btohqsg
Their distinction rate is like what,btohqsg
Imagine having more than 360 days,btohqsg
I do 2 subjects it's like,btohqsg
It slowly increases near a levels periods,btohqsg
Okay it was somewhere between 800-1.2K,btohqsg
I don't remember the exact but she was telling me she wanted to quit cuz it was too ex,btohqsg
And she didn't even get A for a levels in the end,btohqsg
But she jump from S to B,btohqsg
Idk leh tbf econs is rly easy to score,btohqsg
Like from what everyone tells me,btohqsg
It's very easy to get a B for econs,btohqsg
U just need memorise the structure and vomit out,btohqsg
I not rly close with the h1 econs kids,btohqsg
I am currently studying at ITE college east IT Applications Development this Yr is my first year,btohqsg
Eh but it's fun here tho,btohqsg
tbh most H1 arts subjects probs isn’t hard to get a B if you vomit properly,btohqsg
There was someone who was charged 3 years 6 months for 23 charges of sexusl harassment,btohqsg
@juicecogensreally random thought but do you agree that some ppl my age are quite privileged but dont know that they are,btohqsg
and then what do you define as privilege cause i think everyones definition is different and im interested to hear urs,btohqsg
wow why you only care about his thoughts,btohqsg
senpaii i care about you too T_T,btohqsg
but in all seriousness he was the one that popped to mind when i was thinking about that lol,btohqsg
Why tf U acting like a bitch on pms,btohqsg
i met her for 30 seconds and she said so,btohqsg
If you're nice then I'm Jesus christ,btohqsg
Pls it must be u putting up a facade,btohqsg
Jiejie and senpaii are arguing again,btohqsg
i was getting work done at starbucks,btohqsg
"Ofc anyone who's that self-aware would insist that they are ""nice""",btohqsg
mf don’t delete if you’re gonna call me out LOL,btohqsg
As a GOOD ROLE MODEL and her JIE JIE   I believe that's the VERY LEAST I should and ought to do,btohqsg
@chemcerare you gonna be back to cab before next Monday,btohqsg
damn if this MI thing doesn’t work out you have a future career as a comedian all set,btohqsg
well i agree on one part of that text you deleted,btohqsg
need to self censor in public alr,btohqsg
the downies gna say u chinese means u privileged,btohqsg
but doesnt mean sth should be done to nerf them,btohqsg
i want my kids to be nepo babies,btohqsg
i am tempted to ask what is the meaning of nepo baby,btohqsg
cause when we see nepo baby in the media is usually a child of a very wealthy public figure or someone in ent industry,btohqsg
i mean in general if you have connections that can benefit you,btohqsg
but what about not being publicly famous but having enough financial stability to give your children a good life,btohqsg
I find that ppl who are like that tend to fully make use of them,btohqsg
it’s more of how they act with it,btohqsg
cause personally i want to reach a degree of financial freedom where i can afford to give my children what they need  but i also dont want to be overly famous cause idw my children to be exposed to the general public at a young age,btohqsg
like if they’re some cock that act like they got where they are through their own efforts,btohqsg
not saying those people don’t work but ykwim,btohqsg
Omg this is the worst case scenario,btohqsg
"but it's like erm idk ah understandable... Given their lifestyle is diff and unique from the ""normies""",btohqsg
nothing wrong with that  just people are jealous,btohqsg
why their dad cannot work hard,btohqsg
It's not acceptable in any way,btohqsg
yea like understanding doesn’t mean i’m ok with it,btohqsg
but not right if they are like entitled af,btohqsg
just someone with rich parents or parents that can get them into industries,btohqsg
anything that gets you opportunities from the back door,btohqsg
well tbf some people think just bc u r chinese means u r privileged and that “chinese privilege” should be demolished,btohqsg
but the racial grp with the highest income r indians,btohqsg
the entire wakeupsingapore crowd   the subhas nair idiot  practically anyone woke,btohqsg
eh in certain contexts it’s a privilege but not smth you can just apply generally,btohqsg
“highest proportion of uni people are chinese” ok maybe bc chinese r the majority,btohqsg
idk la my minority friends all cool n chill one,btohqsg
maybe the chinese aunties racist thats all,btohqsg
got rich af china new moiney,btohqsg
i meant chinese as in sg chinese,btohqsg
not big brain chinese international chi kid,btohqsg
the buy porsche in class kind,btohqsg
p sure i saw the stats for sg last year,btohqsg
saw a tiktok ant that lol,btohqsg
so most chinese chinese students in sg,btohqsg
or maybe what i saw was proportion of each race that made it to uni,btohqsg
ns i feel like if u ask this qn u also have some level of privilege,btohqsg
im not v privileged but i made it to uni,btohqsg
means what cuz i chinese meh,btohqsg
i think it’s more of the trend over the years that’s interesting ba,btohqsg
Wah I feel like that reminded me of econs non material SOL and material SOL,btohqsg
like malay proportion that made it to uni is still very low compared to chinese or indian,btohqsg
which can be attributed to a lot of factors,btohqsg
including the dynamics and values a lot of their families have,btohqsg
local U only got 1 criteria to get in for citizens tho just do well and can get in,btohqsg
if cant get in means skill issue,btohqsg
If u think that u are better than other people without knowing what privilege looks like then you would also be enjoying some level of privilege what,btohqsg
these ppl saying cuz systemic racism or some shit,btohqsg
maybe im just reading between the lines too much,btohqsg
lol if these people think sg one is systematic racism,btohqsg
eh funny enough muslim brothers got bursary,btohqsg
i intern at saf for 2 years,btohqsg
the indian guy in my office: Talking in chinese = racism,btohqsg
I'm the only one  affected 🤔,btohqsg
Wait this privilege topic is such a nat qn to ask ngl,btohqsg
maybe thats why i inferred it as this,btohqsg
Nat kept mentioning how he is not as privileged as other people = he is btr,btohqsg
nah i just mei shi zuo,btohqsg
i dont like talking abt this topic in depth because people always get overly emotional abt it,btohqsg
they either say they dont have enough privilege or they keep trying to justify their privilege,btohqsg
idk where yall finding these ppl from,btohqsg
my minority friends all cool asf,btohqsg
then because of that I wanna engage on a logical front it becomes very hard,btohqsg
cuz their brain goes out the window and it just get shrouded by anger  sadness  jealousy etc.,btohqsg
eh online platform brings out the worst in ppl,btohqsg
But the thing abt IRL is that if i wanna disengage i just walk away,btohqsg
like its blown out of proportion,btohqsg
"theres also the interesting debate on ""are sap schs racist""",btohqsg
But i would say that systemic racism in SG is very different from systemic racism in US,btohqsg
And this all stems from the fact that from a SG perspective there is no clear understanding on what racial harmony is,btohqsg
Racial harmony vs racial acceptance vs racial tolerance,btohqsg
Even if u go to IPS and see there is no clear definition of RH which they use in their studies,btohqsg
I hav Special Multi Split Personality is Real,btohqsg
there isnt even systemic racism in sg,btohqsg
The EIP alr is a form of systemic racism,btohqsg
Racial-based quota for politicians is also systemic racism,btohqsg
idk but legit curious why last time need to separate boy and girl students,btohqsg
"""The official reason for the establishment of GRCs was to ensure that Singapore's parliament would always be multiracial in composition and representation. This is stipulated by the compulsory inclusion of at least one member in the team of candidates representing the GRC to be from a minority racial group.""",btohqsg
at this day and age anything is racist,btohqsg
these people have no clue how SAP schs even started lol,btohqsg
ok wait this goes against the woke narrative,btohqsg
this is systemic racism against the majority,btohqsg
the way a woke person wld debate it,btohqsg
most (NOT ALL)of the single gender schs were set up by missionaries,btohqsg
ya but u cant just say systemic racism doesnt even exist...,btohqsg
I believe that we need more racism so that there is more racial harmony,btohqsg
"The issue about racial harmony in SG right now from my perspective  is that everyone is damn scared of being offensive towards another race. The issue with this is that the reason why someone is offensive unintentionally is normally due to their preconceived mental schema towards these races. If we continue to ""cancel"" and refuse to have constructive dialogue about what racism is and how it looks like  effectively it becomes very difficult to create a racially harmonious society",btohqsg
People need to be more openly racist for this kind of dialogue to even thrive,btohqsg
this also stems from the fact that Singaporeans and Singapore's policy making is not really about constructing racial harmony but racial blindness. So if you wanna be like really technical abt it  it is very hard to envision how racial harmony in SG actually looks like cause no one even knows how to start,btohqsg
TLDR The problem with racism in SG rn is that it threatens a shift from equality in opportunity to an equity in outcome,btohqsg
but ig no one is ready to have this convo yet cuz if i talk abt this in wusg i will get shut down (Happened to me before :(,btohqsg
isnt that the whole problem with woke,btohqsg
they want equality of outcomes rather than equality of opportunities,btohqsg
and stereotype u based on ur race,btohqsg
but woke people in general i mean,btohqsg
okay i dont rly have any issue with them,btohqsg
which is the whole problem with dei/esg,btohqsg
imo most woke people are all talk no action,btohqsg
so long as ur behaviour does not impede on my ability to do my things i cannot be bothered u just continue leading your life imma do my shit,btohqsg
Y when I was possess by Shemale Spirits in 2013 suddenly I dump all my Wrestling T-Shirts 👕 into Storage Space suddenly I no more interested in Wrestling,btohqsg
the fact that i was reading this 5 seconds ago...,btohqsg
Also i need to caveat that this is just my opinion and I may be speaking from a place of privilege (Cause im chinese) but yes if anyone wanna fight me over this sure,btohqsg
is this satire i hope ut is,btohqsg
"2day 30 January 2024(Tuesday)Wrestling Spirits Is""The American Dragon🐉🐲""Daniel Bryan!!!!Yes!Yes!Yes!Yes!",btohqsg
normally course content shldnt be that different from each poly right?,btohqsg
oh the y3 internships n stuff ye,btohqsg
@chemcerdo you think is advised to ckw halfway or no,btohqsg
Ok suppose you are stuck in this social situation that you dont want to attend but kinda have to. You leaving wont actually impact anyone concretely(maybe ur friend will be a bit sad but thats it) and wont have any effect on anyones academic or school record. You feel very uncomfortable halfway during the event due to some things you are requested to do,btohqsg
In this case is it ok to just leave,btohqsg
Wow korkor is a CHAO KENG WARRIOR,btohqsg
like ofc graded work i wont slack,btohqsg
but like sometimes i feel very overwhelmed by social events and idr want to do the stuff they want us to,btohqsg
