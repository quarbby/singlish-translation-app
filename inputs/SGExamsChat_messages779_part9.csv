I‚Äôm worried about doing Econs in uni especially after seeing that interest rate qn,btohqsg
Im sry if i killed u,btohqsg
If I were to resit for the same h2 math paper I took last year I‚Äôd probably get a C or D instead of an A cos I forgot so much,btohqsg
Nah I just have to suck it up and force myself to touch the math even if I hate it,btohqsg
Tbh it is not gonna be the math u hate,btohqsg
At least I think the non math part I‚Äôll enjoy,btohqsg
But dun worry it is just first order,btohqsg
According to people I have heard from,btohqsg
What is it that you think I‚Äôll hate?,btohqsg
Dun tell me u cannot do differentiation to calculate MR fr TR or MC fr TC,btohqsg
Dun tell me algebra is a problem,btohqsg
Then maybe you will do some form of linear programming,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs easier than h2 math I can probably manage but doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll like doing them also,btohqsg
Is it something like what Xavier sent in the other chat a while ago lol,btohqsg
Cause 80% of the h2 history students take econs,btohqsg
So they are all at lecture now,btohqsg
I don't know what he sends whoops,btohqsg
And now history lect hall only got me and another guy and the teacher,btohqsg
The equation for determining PED at any point along a straight line graph,btohqsg
Or is it not stuff like that,btohqsg
That lesson bout go into history,btohqsg
That one is not expected of u to lay that right out,btohqsg
But to understand the concept behind it,btohqsg
Cos I googled this and I saw it‚Äôs about creating linear equations in Econs,btohqsg
And also i realised nus econs and ntu econs is different ya,btohqsg
Wait let me try to find,btohqsg
they will usually arrive a bit late cause of the h2 econ lecture,btohqsg
Nus is mainly mcqs / fill in blanks actually,btohqsg
Linear optimization is usually if you have like super duper a lot of constraints,btohqsg
Fml the heat is giving me a headache,btohqsg
I definitely won‚Äôt enjoy doing these kinds of stuff,btohqsg
This one is not really required but it is a general concept u need to know,btohqsg
Nope i was trolling  im not an econs student  im currently taking 1 econs elective,btohqsg
This is more of like analysing the case for different values of Q and like trying to find the link between Q and PED,btohqsg
Linear programming is usually used when you got a lot of constraints,btohqsg
Then you want to find the best values to produce numerous number of goods,btohqsg
That helps to maximise your profit/minimize your loss,btohqsg
Usually economics will do a little bit of OR,btohqsg
if u take higher-level econs mods and not just ‚Äúintro to econs‚Äù it‚Äôs not just gonna be algebra and dydx lol. u almost need everything from h2 math and even more,btohqsg
my macro mod this sem ü§£,btohqsg
Gg I‚Äôll probably try to choose mods in a way where I can avoid as much math as possible,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think I can survive this,btohqsg
Yea I knew it is definitely way way more than that,btohqsg
this one is core mod. cannot escape üòÇ,btohqsg
Bruh not gonna be it man,btohqsg
I wun deny this coz in a way yes,btohqsg
I need to answer the qns,btohqsg
Oh yea calculus module in econs major is compulsory,btohqsg
One of my friends who took econs major accidentally took calculus for math major,btohqsg
Math is also applied english coz i rmb not understanding what a stats qns was asking during AsüíÄ,btohqsg
