CNA üìöüó£Voices:In school  CNA TODAY's Eunice Sng scored an A1 for O-Level Chinese - but as an adult  she struggles to speak the language. How can we reverse declining standards of mother tongue proficiency in Singapore? Is there a need for change in the education system?                 More than 700 students were caught vaping in the 3rd quarter of this year  say authorities. A total of 3 840 people were fined during the quarter  a 52% increase compared to the previous quarter:                                                   üß†Mental Health Matters:What is cognitive reserve?

More details on the apps:,btohqsg
@iSean97what do you think of these news?,btohqsg
how is there finals rn lol,btohqsg
from the headlines what interest me might be- the 4k people in SG using vapes.- Score O level Chinese A1 but don't know how to communicate with it seems wrong- MOE needs Chromebooks/iPads to have additional management software  seems abit overboard. The Chromebook/iPad is property of the school/MOE or students' parents own paid items?,btohqsg
- also isn't vapes are banned in Singapore? Cigarettes I think still exists right...?,btohqsg
most likely would be intercepted at the airport security I guess.,btohqsg
the MOE thing is relevant to the school issued devices not their own ones,btohqsg
