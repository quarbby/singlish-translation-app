quality will improve oiver time when it is made in germany,btohqsg
"good comparison actually because i am pretty sure both ""understeers like a pig"" as niki lauda described",btohqsg
i am thinking of buying one,btohqsg
What cars are you planning to test out? Have a few friends who have dragy's,btohqsg
wanna see how slow mazda is,btohqsg
oooh  make sure to get your tire pressures right and temperature up,btohqsg
and roughly same weather for both runs,btohqsg
Just to complement this that I bought a few months ago.,btohqsg
Any bummers here have this gadget? It can record laps and display dme parameters,btohqsg
sorry  isn't that an iphone mount?,btohqsg
One thing interesting is the cat temperatures goes up over 1000 C l. This is unbelievably hot under hard acceleration,btohqsg
that looks like an iphone in the picture,btohqsg
That‚Äôs just the phone to display the app,btohqsg
I just need a device to save petrol ... LOL,btohqsg
1000c?? i hope you are ok sir,btohqsg
ahhh so in the box you get the mount  app subscription and OBD reader?,btohqsg
backside haven‚Äôt burn yet ah haha,btohqsg
This one I tell you  got at home already  2 legs,btohqsg
No. The box has the obd2,btohqsg
so just an OBD reader then?,btohqsg
dragy top car in sg is TT js saying üòè,btohqsg
oh sorry sorry electric power wins i forgot,btohqsg
First you take a lap on the track to let it record the circuit using gps. Then it record your car performance dumping  the telemetry sort of showing you brake force g force power etc,btohqsg
I believe the newer M models have this built into the idrive,btohqsg
It also records videos which you can overlay the readings,btohqsg
Yes. All in there much more advanced than this.,btohqsg
What I like is it has the voltage reading to tell battery health!,btohqsg
oh yeah this feature is cool  opel insignia got voltmeter on speedo also i think quite cool,btohqsg
Wish it can tell the cca.,btohqsg
G force is cool. Can read out when very high say I corner in a roundabout like 0.8 g it beeps,btohqsg
Tesla has all this built in right,btohqsg
Audi  BMW  Merc  Honda  Nissan all,btohqsg
The g80 m3 is quite advanced. You can set how much slide you want,btohqsg
All automated. Computer does it for you.,btohqsg
The perks of driving old cars. The Mechanical feel. The tyres will feedback the grip condition to you directly.,btohqsg
No drive by wire  no middleman. No assist.,btohqsg
3 point turn can become a gym day already,btohqsg
drive for a month a tricep start to grow alr haha,btohqsg
Yeahhh  McLaren was one of the first to come up with the variable drift control if I remember correctly. And Ford had a drift mode in their focus RS even though it's AWD,btohqsg
That‚Äôs even older than e92. E92 is fly by write throttle. üòÇ but still many things manual. Like control. Todays cars are so automated,btohqsg
The hydraulic steering is heavy even assisted. When turned to M mdm mode it‚Äôs heavy feel.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a launch control o have not experimented yet. Wait till my Michelin tires are older,btohqsg
Can only do with the newer electronic LSDs,btohqsg
Like how since I‚Äôm the most handsome man in my bedroom  when outside  I must be the most handsome still!!,btohqsg
My mother and the chicken rice stall aunty both say I'm handsome. So I'm handsome for everyone but the girls never say I am :(,btohqsg
the yaris GR can do allthe wonderful things too with split torque control front and rear,btohqsg
can do what rear wheel drive cars do,btohqsg
Even the new g80 M3 xdrive very clever with this,btohqsg
i bought a mechanical LSD for the e30 from USA,btohqsg
like soon says  there is nothing like all things manual,btohqsg
