O lvl always teach Caso4 is solid right,btohqsg
FCE also doesnt lie. If not u get poisoned,btohqsg
Ya lor u sure or not,btohqsg
I mean FCE not supposed to teach u chem rite? No point knowing so much,btohqsg
If is propaganda  its not a lie,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they teach u not to put weird shit in ur food,btohqsg
It is made out of sodium,btohqsg
That's my bio answer for prelims,btohqsg
Idk what to say for bad effects of genetically modifying eggs so i said chemical warfare weapon,btohqsg
It's legit I was so desperate,btohqsg
If the egg got bad things,btohqsg
How is it chemical warfare lol,btohqsg
who knows covid might be spreaded via an egg,btohqsg
Yeah imagine lighting yourself up when farting,btohqsg
Gonna prepare a lighter beside someone who farts silently often,btohqsg
Wait guys so how do i make more friends,btohqsg
I need more EQ tips or im gg to be forever alone,btohqsg
Btw anyone know why hydrogen gas is less soluble than oxygen gas in water,btohqsg
I was thinking that oxygen gas still had several electrons not involved in bonding whilst hydrogen gas all is in duplet config so no electrons free from bonding,btohqsg
"No such thing as ""less soluble""",btohqsg
Yes induced dipole.. all molecules have that,btohqsg
Honestly its what the o lvl paper said and im sk fucking,btohqsg
Hydrogen gas got London dispersion forces?????? OH YEAH,btohqsg
But the lower the mr the lower the london dispersion forces,btohqsg
As Long as there’s electron cloud  there’s LDF,btohqsg
I guess but it got me thinking,btohqsg
When hydrogen tries to dissolve in water  interactions are formed,btohqsg
Unfortunately the amt of energy released from these interactions isnt enough for the amt of energy needed to overcome the imf in both water and h2,btohqsg
But i wont be surprised why hydrogen is insoluble,btohqsg
Since the bond length btwn both H atoms is very short,btohqsg
So is actually strong (ignore the bond energy value),btohqsg
And thus not easy to break,btohqsg
Oxygen on the other hand has a longer bond length,btohqsg
Bruh okay my god i feel dumb,btohqsg
It’s about the IMF  not covalent bond within molecule,btohqsg
Break bond between the water particles,btohqsg
Form bond between the particles and water,btohqsg
Bond length is more related to reactivity,btohqsg
UGHH GOD DAMN IT Im too stupid for this shit,btohqsg
Bonds are nvr broken when particles change from solid to liquid to gasIs imf,btohqsg
So... why is o2 more soluble..,btohqsg
Guys thanks for always answering my questions,btohqsg
Im just curious sry sry 👉👈,btohqsg
Well so far we think that its the bond length of the covalent bond,btohqsg
But the intermolecular forces of attraction is the main thing determining solubility,btohqsg
Honestly this is fucking beyond me sorry,btohqsg
Induced dipole-induced dipole interactions formed between oxygen molecules and water molecules are stronger,btohqsg
But the idid force b/w O2 molecules are quite strong too,btohqsg
Hence energy released is greater  more sufficient to overcome the interactions between water molecules and between oxygen molecules,btohqsg
The idid forces b/w o2 molecules are stronger than that b/w h2 molecules i think,btohqsg
I again apologise for being so irritating,btohqsg
So i think more energy is needed to break the bond hence o2 less soluble,btohqsg
Lol it’s ok  good to ask,btohqsg
I think that's enuf chem for the day my brain feels rrly tired ughh,btohqsg
paper 1 qn paper can bring home right?,btohqsg
Who don't want the textbooks or papers can donate to me? 😂,btohqsg
bcs the wheels go backwards in order to move forward,btohqsg
got people say A  got people say B,btohqsg
then got pple also say C,btohqsg
What’s the ans for min force needed to lift block,btohqsg
i think should be C too,btohqsg
only front wheel driven by car engine,btohqsg
Oh thank god I last min change from 16 to 12,btohqsg
The direction of the wheel is clockwise isnt it,btohqsg
why u making ur life difficult,btohqsg
i jus highlight the info ma,btohqsg
dont the wheels move same direction,btohqsg
depending on the car  whether its a front wheel  back wheel or all wheel drive,btohqsg
sorry  im too bored in the office,btohqsg
then how does it even drive???,btohqsg
dunnid scared  i think its C,btohqsg
i got the dumb aluminum qn wrong:-(,btohqsg
paiseh im too dumb for this,btohqsg
I got like 12 or 13 Cs for the entire paper lol,btohqsg
oh no i put d 🤣,btohqsg
Wait u all got answer sheet?,btohqsg
I not sure how many marks I minused lol but so far the qns discussed here I think I got correct,btohqsg
i def minus more than 10,btohqsg
i cant go tmr anyw cos they recorded me as dropped btw,btohqsg
I jus dropped at the start of sec 3,btohqsg
And the first batch to sit for it was in 2007,btohqsg
It's been around for quite long,btohqsg
Econs can bullshit and probably pass thou,btohqsg
Is it to protect from electrocution,btohqsg
It's to prevent electrocution I think,btohqsg
when current exceeds fuse rating  fuse melts and breaks circuit  to prevent overheating,btohqsg
I thought that's what the earth wire does or something,btohqsg
btw how mch yall think yall can get for p1,btohqsg
Textbook just say prevent excessive current flow,btohqsg
Hopefully I not more than 3 wrong,btohqsg
o level physics easiest get A,btohqsg
we'll see when we get the results lol 🤣,btohqsg
Thanks for reminding me of my own stupidity,btohqsg
probably i will cry lmao 🤣,btohqsg
B is wrong cos the excess electrons would flow out on the right,btohqsg
Wouldnt the excess electrons from the ground flow up into the sphere and neutralise the LHS?,btohqsg
No there is a net positive charge on left side since electrons flow away  as like charges attract,btohqsg
even if someone is bad at physics o level physics is still easy A,btohqsg
The positive charges are locked I think,btohqsg
I dont think u understand what my definition of bad is,btohqsg
No I mean like the electrons from earth flow up,btohqsg
i don't even know how do electricity,btohqsg
I dont even know how to do sound wtf,btohqsg
I think I lost like 4-5 marks alr,btohqsg
density is the same for the same material,btohqsg
Like the truck one if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
So that one is it D,btohqsg
work done = energy converted ma,btohqsg
sian i not this year take,btohqsg
i took last year already ha,btohqsg
I thought 3600x100 was a bit too easy so I doubted my answer lol,btohqsg
Maybe if u take this year  u will do better who knows,btohqsg
But it’s just like the propeller trick question from 2018,btohqsg
The force of the water in propellor?,btohqsg
That one is super straightforward if ur careful,btohqsg
last year got a qn the answer is the copper poles will have some electric field thing and attract,btohqsg
i said the copper poles melted,btohqsg
That one idk I just cancel LOL,btohqsg
rip i didnt understand the q,btohqsg
also why the top one A ah,btohqsg
But that one I read wrongly put D haish,btohqsg
electron flow opp of conventional current,btohqsg
I thot that it wasnt conventional lmao,btohqsg
Then u reverse current for electr9n,btohqsg
I would’ve gotten full marks if not for Q29,btohqsg
So angry with myself cos I did the correct working but still saw the options wrongly 😢,btohqsg
Wow... I would be so joyous if I get 36,btohqsg
rip my marks cos of 6 and 30,btohqsg
You are sad that u lost 1 mark but when its others  you just tell them it's just 2 marks,btohqsg
i havent count my total marks for mcq yet tho,btohqsg
My practical was super shitty so I might be pulled down to A2,btohqsg
So that’s why MCQ I was aiming near full mark,btohqsg
Yea I guess but it's still hypocritical,btohqsg
I screwed up practical really badly like I’m guessing I barley passed or even boderline fail,btohqsg
i still hope my practical was decent,btohqsg
I probably did worse than u,btohqsg
Both physics and chem were like that for me,btohqsg
oh i didnt test any gas and i drew straight line graph for sor,btohqsg
people who get 90+ for chem,btohqsg
I've never seen such holy numbers beforr,btohqsg
there are people who get that score,btohqsg
I think my chem would be like 82% if mcq I get near full marks so I guess I’ll drop to A2,btohqsg
As usual my practical was shit,btohqsg
I love how Bedok is literally rubbing it in our faces,btohqsg
i need full marks for mcq,btohqsg
Rotate the 2 numbers and u get my score,btohqsg
Nice one u will probably somehow get 75 or more,btohqsg
His chem is only a bit worse than me lol for prelim,btohqsg
Plus I used to get F9 for chem,btohqsg
chem is fun but idl studying it for exam,btohqsg
Oh wait Essek I meant for Mcq not overall,btohqsg
Oh I thought u mean overall,btohqsg
honesty is the best policy yalls,btohqsg
Uh congrats for ur straight As?,btohqsg
i wish i could say thank you,btohqsg
tbh i had 3 distinctions in prelims,btohqsg
amath is my only confident a1 subj,btohqsg
But econs was a large contributor,btohqsg
i was over the moon i tell u,btohqsg
due to some error my practical 1 more mark,btohqsg
26 points for 5 subjs can le,btohqsg
Didnt u get 8 points for Os?,btohqsg
U from exp or NA Sec 5?,btohqsg
I feel like you got 8 points,btohqsg
Cuz last year my sch got one Sec 5 student get 7pts,btohqsg
I think its raw 10 nett 8,btohqsg
Cuz he took 3 subjects in 4NA,btohqsg
no loss for me cos ntg is easy in econs for me so ya,btohqsg
I mean u seem smart  way smarter than me at least  so I guessed u were from ACJC or the 7 pointer schools,btohqsg
How am I hypocritical lol I alr said my results probably would be bad I boderline pass chinese for Os and my English lc was shit so I’m guessing the only A1 I might get this time is just for econs,btohqsg
English  O level maths and O level Chinese,btohqsg
I wanted to drop to clb but my sch didn’t allow,btohqsg
Ya cuz SBB start this year,btohqsg
No I was happy with C6,btohqsg
I think hes talking about u being sad about mcq and trying to tell the other guy that it was ok since it was only 2 marks,btohqsg
For NA ppl taking O level science,btohqsg
But for me I was sad because it was a careless mistake,btohqsg
I had a friend who was more upset than most people who got even less cos he lost one mark in a test due to careless mistake,btohqsg
So it’s the same logic here for me,btohqsg
Bruh I got 0.5 marks for geog once,btohqsg
For my sch last year those from NA who take O level Maths or English must also sit for both O and NA EL and Maths.,btohqsg
my classmate got 19/35 for amath cried 2 fucking lessons when theres ppl getting single digit,btohqsg
Was i talking about chinese? I have known u since Sec 1. Not only I think this way okay? Also   u been getting A1 for physics and other subjects in prelims  don't make it look like u are getting F9s,btohqsg
i want to slap her so bad,btohqsg
My chinese WA1 I got 3/50 lmao,btohqsg
Out of 15 sorry shd say that too,btohqsg
I thgt my humans damn bad liao,btohqsg
I cant find the paper so idk,btohqsg
No I won’t be getting F9s but I’ll drop to A2 for a lot of subjects based on my estimation of the grade threshold,btohqsg
Plus my teacher alr said a fair bit of ppl for phsyics prelim A1 o level drop to A2 or B3,btohqsg
Becus my cher think I did shit,btohqsg
I’m pretty certain I will become that type of person,btohqsg
Funny u say that and still get A1 everytime,btohqsg
Plus I think the sch prelim this year is easier than most o level papers,btohqsg
Nothing compares to 0.5 marks  sometimes I think to myself that the teacher shd just give me 0,btohqsg
So that’s why I’m certain my o level results would be worse than prelim,btohqsg
Like e math u will probably need 92% for A1  so prelim even if I get 75-90% it’s still definitely not good enough,btohqsg
Maybe but not confirmed. If the distance is too far or if its 5 days a week then no,btohqsg
What u get for emath in prelims?,btohqsg
Did u compare that to the average score?,btohqsg
90 but I think my o level lost around 10% and that’s almost certainly drop to A2. My tutor said his student estimated he got around 93-94% for e math but still dropped to A2,btohqsg
e math the percentage is very high since everyone does well,btohqsg
ill start studying in dec zzz,btohqsg
Might not even make it so idk,btohqsg
U have alot of tutors....... 90 is higher then most people fyi its prob top 5% in cohort already,btohqsg
No even many others I ask say that e math A1 is almost certainly above 90%,btohqsg
i thought most ppl get 85-90+,btohqsg
I also got another friend who took sbb estimated he got around 85% and drop to A2,btohqsg
Cannot be so high one la,btohqsg
Is that why u didnt take this year,btohqsg
pure sci 80%+ right im pr sure,btohqsg
Well I guess I’ll see on 11 jan next year,btohqsg
So you think it can’t possibly be 85 for A1 for chem?,btohqsg
And now he saying he's smart,btohqsg
U said something like that earlier lol,btohqsg
Cant relate to all these big brains,btohqsg
Why u like to flex so much,btohqsg
Did u see the full context,btohqsg
When i get A for math (which possibly wont happen),btohqsg
And finger print to log in,btohqsg
Acer Switch 5  as good and fast as surface,btohqsg
More talented than me in earning money,btohqsg
I didn't spend any money on it,btohqsg
my boss is judging my choice of fashion,btohqsg
But legit the writing expeirence damn good,btohqsg
Finally I got it at cheap price,btohqsg
My bio lecture Alot of people bring laptop,btohqsg
To either read the bio notes,btohqsg
i use my laptop reply tele and whatsapp,btohqsg
Hello is this B or C,btohqsg
Cuz my friend said it is B,btohqsg
everyone on keynote learning was literally arguing between B and C HAHA,btohqsg
my cher also said is b,btohqsg
I THOUGHT THE CWSS PPR GIVE WRONG ANS,btohqsg
coz cwss ppr got like a similar q also,btohqsg
Bruh I just guessed... C looked too obvious for how much they wrote,btohqsg
Gg then I lost 2 marks,btohqsg
Now I don’t feel as bad,btohqsg
Because at least I know I lost marks not solely due to careless mistake,btohqsg
Hopefully not bad enough to drop to A2 because practical was super bad,btohqsg
Nah still got 2 more for me,btohqsg
He confirm A one la haha,btohqsg
This doesn't even make any sense,btohqsg
Just realised 2018 paper used the almost exact same question,btohqsg
The white ppl in cambridge lazy set qn. Just recycle,btohqsg
Can i sell my knife here?,btohqsg
Lol O lvl mcq alw gt repeated de,btohqsg
Today is Phy O lvl MCQ ? Last paper for O lvl ?,btohqsg
I think combined science is last,btohqsg
In jc  is cca of any use to get into uni? Like in o lvls do well in cca can get bonus 2 points. In jc is there any benefits like that?,btohqsg
Oh so chance to get scholarship only,btohqsg

CCA is not even compulsory in JC...,btohqsg
Is chinese as a subject important in JC?,btohqsg
Cuz for those who have weak foundation idk if can score well tho,btohqsg
But can just don’t care about MT?,btohqsg
Why do ppl even take cca in jc then,btohqsg
Ohh so need that for uni ah,btohqsg
And also to relax and have a break from studies i guess,btohqsg
I think unis require a minimum pass for mt at a lvls or a pass in hmt at o lvls,btohqsg
U need to pass to apply for Uni,btohqsg
+ im not eligible alr lmao 🤣,btohqsg
If got 10 pts why go rp tho,btohqsg
they need cca grade of excellent idh tbh,btohqsg
maybe nearby for some ppl lorh,btohqsg
10 is my target 😀 but os have been a shitshow 😀,btohqsg
Get 1 time in the year enough or must get it for term 4,btohqsg
Dont they rate ur conduct grade 4 times a year for each term?,btohqsg
no? thats what u get aft 4 years of ccatheres no conduct grade for cca what i thot,btohqsg
Oh wait i thot u were talking about class,btohqsg
ikr i cannot eat almonds this is going mad,btohqsg
what did i walk in on,btohqsg
Is CCA in JC only useful for scholarship?,btohqsg
What if you have no leadership position but win a ton of accolades,btohqsg
why u ask me lmao 😂,btohqsg
is also unrealistic to win a ton of accolades also,btohqsg
most ppl alr struggling just from academics alone,btohqsg
Like go nationals and all that,btohqsg
Will that help with a scholarship,btohqsg
if bench then nationals a bit,btohqsg
if apply with things like sports will probably be good to show video,btohqsg

if a div benchwarmer  but ur team wins the championship/2nd  then it helps a bit,btohqsg
if u participate in olympiads  but didnt make it to finals  wont help also,btohqsg
in other words  not easy to get a lot of good accolades,btohqsg
solo sport international/regional comp top 3 can?,btohqsg
cos i have potential to rep sg next year overseas,btohqsg
so like even if participation but rep sg oversea can anot 🧐,btohqsg
i have a friend whose national canoeing tema,btohqsg
and went to like SEA games,btohqsg
not everyone in nationals go represent,btohqsg
den even tho he didnt do well for his Prelim or O level,btohqsg
thing is mine is solo sport though and theres little competition locally,btohqsg
like my sec school football national champions,btohqsg
so representing is a big thing,btohqsg
ok la next year then say,btohqsg
i need win first in sg first,btohqsg
