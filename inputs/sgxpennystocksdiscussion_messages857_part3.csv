To those who buy on hopes of 0.10 for Manu  I have seen many cases of BBs manipulating prices riding on retailers' hopes  only to drop the bag on them and run road and leave them holding the bag. Medtecs was one of them. I echo jojo that such stocks good for short term trading  not holding,btohqsg
What about those who buy on hopes of 0.20? 😂,btohqsg
That one I will double join JA on shorting 😅,btohqsg
Just DYODD  the US office mkt is in a bad state  and Wework bankruptcy isn't helping. You think Manu will improve it's fundamental (restructuring plan or not) to justify price back to 0.20 (for the short to medium term at least),btohqsg
I think Manu is different bcos price dropped so much plus they secured tenancy renewal but yes good to be cautious,btohqsg
Sure  to each his own  like I said  DYODD and trade accordingly 👍,btohqsg
