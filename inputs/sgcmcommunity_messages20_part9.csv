I love driving at SPA in video games.,btohqsg
Very unique high speed circuit.Once tyre loose grid = gg liao HAHA,btohqsg
The moment your front tyre lost traction and understeer....,btohqsg
i agree that there are too many street circuit  but when you see circuits like circuit de barcelona-catalunya  circuit can also be boring haha,btohqsg
my all time fav F1 circuit will still be the nurburgring nordschleife,btohqsg
15 inch is great. Cheap tyres  good comfort  economical for low powered cars  and very common size.13 and 14 incher are rarer.,btohqsg
I saw 21” on my neighbour’s car before… super big,btohqsg
Too bad FOM is demanding lots of money to host a gp and traditional circuit is being sideline of not able to cough out the money.,btohqsg
"STB: ""However  these returns seem to be diminishing the longer the race goes on. """,btohqsg
Blame bernie for the high hosting cost. Lol.,btohqsg
But i think singapore hosting is right given both tangible and intangible benefits.,btohqsg

EV cars typically uses narrower width tires even on large rims. Traction must be damn good,btohqsg
Typically 20” should be 255 right?,btohqsg
damn bumpy . I 18 inch already feel bumpy,btohqsg
Yes! Combination of all factors for sure,btohqsg
"For a split sec  I read massage ""spa"" 😂",btohqsg
And my psi is 42 as recommended lol and extra load,btohqsg
Ya  quick change of topic. Any massage lovers here?,btohqsg
Actually the drive is good haha very smooth,btohqsg
When the tyre is like 42 psi,btohqsg
Less rolling resistance like over inflated tires.,btohqsg
42 is the base recommended level I believe for the m3p,btohqsg
Agree though  sounds high for the car hahah,btohqsg
My beetle front only need 19 PSI lol,btohqsg
True. Depending on tire sizes. Smaller tires usually lower pressure.,btohqsg
But I'm guessing because of the instant pulls most Teslas are forced through  it's needed,btohqsg
Yuppp  also depends on weight of the car,btohqsg
Last time typical of 210-220kpa for jdm cars,btohqsg
