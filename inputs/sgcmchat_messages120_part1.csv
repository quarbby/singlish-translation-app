Honestly Idm getting a old C or E class and just running it until it dies,btohqsg
I‚Äôm js scared it will actually kill me,btohqsg
if u get a W124 or W201 it will never die,btohqsg
Tbh the R33 was a negative brain cell thing,btohqsg
I could‚Äôve saved so much money on another car,btohqsg
It just wasn‚Äôt worth how long I used it for,btohqsg
Plus I think any other drift car wldve surfed,btohqsg
The R33 was me being a clout chaser and wanting a popular car,btohqsg
And that was an idiot desicion,btohqsg
remind me not to talk to car guys anym,btohqsg
It has its good and bads but I didn‚Äôt push it enough to feel the diff,btohqsg
It‚Äôs heavy but u can feel the power,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs a very good beginner car cos u can actually feel the weight shift,btohqsg
But after awhile the high torque and power takes a toll on ur tires,btohqsg
And the real cost is the tires,btohqsg
$100 per set ah so ok,btohqsg
thought you would use the falkens,btohqsg
Most garages don‚Äôt have falkens lying arnd for cheap oso,btohqsg
And they only order if there‚Äôs a demand,btohqsg
was it MCM that did it,btohqsg
But like the more ‚Äúlocal‚Äù tires are just cheap asf,btohqsg
On a Kei car or smth,btohqsg
I have a Mark 2 waiting,btohqsg
But dk if I wanna go thru w it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs either commit now and if smithing fucks up I just die,btohqsg
Or actually wait until I‚Äôm financially sure that I can handle the whole build even if shit gals,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs no ‚Äúgood‚Äù car for good price out there anymore it‚Äôs always gna be a trade off somewhere,btohqsg
There never really was but it was just less obvious cos cars used to cost a lot less,btohqsg
i think waiting out the covid prices i s good ah,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs the demand of it,btohqsg
Like there‚Äôs only so many more S14s out there,btohqsg
but RWD  drift car? CROWN COMFORT üî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
And like the AE86 has been hyped up so much,btohqsg
i heard its cause they import in,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not saying the AE86 is a bad car but it‚Äôs just not ‚Äúall that‚Äù,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs really just a Corolla with a fictional story,btohqsg
The only thing good about it is the 50-50 ratio thing but honestly it also doesn‚Äôt make the price right,btohqsg
like is it 200k USD worthy?,btohqsg
The R34 was just hyped up by FnF also,btohqsg
"i get that it's a ""supercar killer"" but still",btohqsg
I guess if u really like the car but it‚Äôs really not all that,btohqsg
pls dun hype FD2R up thank,btohqsg
im okay w them  but max 50k imo,btohqsg
All the JDM car kids think a stock R34 can do shit,btohqsg
Like a 2015 cayenne s can outrun a GTR34,btohqsg
Yeah i mean no hate to GTR fans ah ofc but I personally dun understand,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs cool n all but it‚Äôs not for me igs,btohqsg
Can a GTR fit 7 people,btohqsg
The important thing is that it can reach,btohqsg
Idk my taste in cars is described as rats ass,btohqsg
