To achieve what an ilp too  all you have do to is buy whole life limited pay and do regular saving plan (investment in unit trust) seperately,btohqsg
Quick questions   does having 20+ referrals for an app counts as a lot? Any referral kings/queens here haha,btohqsg
Advantage of whole life limited pay is u pay the insurance for 15-25 year but coverage until 99.While ilp insurance fee increase as u age and it seem cheap when young it does get very expensive when u age.,btohqsg
Alternative buy term and invest the rest will do the job too,btohqsg
To be honest  agent recommend hybid product as the commission is very lucrativr,btohqsg
moneyowl ceo  providend ceo both were ex insurance agent too  and both thinks ILP are terrible product lol,btohqsg
It take a great mathematician to figure out their fees. They can anyhow charge you fees also you don't know. By end of 10 to 20 years. Even if the funds it purchase went up a lot. Your insurance may only have same value as your capital input. And this is the best case scenario. So worse case scenario? And the spread between buy and sell of ilps is huge. Almost 5 to 10%. [as far as I remember when my relatives show me],btohqsg
Fee is not the scary part  it is increasing for sure that is a know fact. The scary part is the investment performance  it just eat away your capital if it dont perform,btohqsg

It's very easy to get sold on such products especially when you are younger because industry experts will prey on your lack of information / information asymmetry. That's why I need to build such a community to gather various opinions so we can all build a better financial future for ourselves.,btohqsg
