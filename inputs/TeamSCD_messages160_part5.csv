They failed my stock tinted windows.,btohqsg
i nv passed once thr only stock altis pass ðŸ¤®,btohqsg
Anybody tried the Yishun vicom before,btohqsg
That's right. They told me the previous owner changed the rear 3 windows from clear to tinted. I asked if it makes sense to really indent and buy a set of tinted window instead of purely doing a 100% tint film ? He said he dont know  but based on the current set up  its a fail.,btohqsg
I sourced here and there that entire afternoon and and got a quote for around 700$ per piece of window. If you change 3  that is $2.1k.,btohqsg
In the end  i just headed down to vicom opposite the road and fork out another $70+. Cleared without issues,btohqsg
some PI fail inspection because the PI use clear window for homologation before selling.,btohqsg
Sinming sta very strict. Stock tint also check one. Normal,btohqsg
Tried there before. The inspector there still OK. Passed my car with blue headlight tint.,btohqsg
