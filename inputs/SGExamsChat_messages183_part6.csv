Uni i will research further next time,btohqsg
For example  some of my courses in uni has to be applied or heavily computational mathematics  and I hate them. But from the outside it is hard to tell that they are going to be like that. Applied is obvious. Computational  difficult to tell.,btohqsg
I was alrd offered by ngee ang poly,btohqsg
But you can just apply in JAE for JC  right,btohqsg
The withdrawal dateline was last week,btohqsg
You can accept and reject them later  right? I did this for unis,btohqsg
Can't you research? When your O level results come out  you never know  maybe you want to try to apply for JC and just reject the poly offer,btohqsg
Otherwise how can you safefguard yourself if another offer that is better hasn't come through,btohqsg
Why? Because your friends and brother scared you?,btohqsg
I just dw to go thru sec sch but harder,btohqsg
You must be prepared for mugging,btohqsg
kinda v cool to be stress,btohqsg
just cuz its easier doesnt mean its better,btohqsg
But i srsly dw to go jc,btohqsg
JC has this terrifying image built around it by teachers and seniors,btohqsg
But how do you know that you will score well enough in poly to get into uni?,btohqsg

When I went to JC  it was faster and harder than secondary  but it was possible to keep up  and it was fun to keep learning new things,btohqsg
I rly dw to go jc and learn humans,btohqsg
It seems like O levels is more stressful than A levels  because there are more subjects and things to care about such as CCA points,btohqsg
Chinese in JC is a non factor,btohqsg
You can do science. Economics is a social science,btohqsg
It will naturally come to you,btohqsg
And it doesn't affect uni admissions  unless you do better in chinese,btohqsg
Hmm not really though... not for most ppl... I mean if one just wants to just scrape through year 1  then probably ok,btohqsg
what if I wanna do chinese lit,btohqsg
I mean I didn't relax  but you technically can. But poly  the grades start counting from the first semester. In JC  no  except for PW,btohqsg
Ik you all trying to ask me not to follow other people's decision,btohqsg
We want you to be fully informed,btohqsg
Okay if you just want to promote  then can relax a bit,btohqsg
And for JC  if you need to retake A levels  it is easy as a private candidate,btohqsg
Lol PW.. may year 1 students mad rushing after promos,btohqsg
Just clear once and for all,btohqsg
If i go jc i btr be clearing it,btohqsg
I mean  if he needs to. But if he doesn't  which most people are like that  then well and good,btohqsg
JC don't suit me a lot,btohqsg
It’s good that poly is ur authentic choice and not something others decided for u,btohqsg
Very very few people in my classes in JC retained in J1,btohqsg
just dont go poly because you think its easy,btohqsg
Well.. I mean if you still undecided on what career path to take  jc can buy you some time to consider,btohqsg

Poly kids usually learn their specialty subjects more in depth than most JC kids,btohqsg
I went to poly cuz ik what to do,btohqsg
But if you know what you want to work in future  then go for poly,btohqsg
ONLY FOREIGN SCHOLAR WILL DO WELL,btohqsg
In poly  you’ll be more attuned to work life,btohqsg
My class had tons of foreign scholars. And not all did super well,btohqsg
No  be born to rich parents and party all day,btohqsg
Or just grad with O levels,btohqsg
