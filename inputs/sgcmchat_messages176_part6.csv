is that a RX7? sorry am new to cars.,btohqsg
isn't the FD1 the one that Roysinke Takasheeshee one?,btohqsg
ok guys as my first step as admin,btohqsg
i want to ask a VERY important question,btohqsg
Ah shit I voted the wrong thing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
dont worry everyone has their own taste,btohqsg
but not everyone can do doughy,btohqsg
doughy with that perfect sour fish curry,btohqsg
itâ€™s almost as perfect as a how good the Zonda couldâ€™ve been,btohqsg
i feel like raisuke tashika is better,btohqsg
the let down being the handling,btohqsg
or a lack of skill from the driver's part,btohqsg
i trust hamiltons word on it being hard to handle,btohqsg
the moment he touch the throttle in the tunnel,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why lewis sold it anyways,btohqsg
he said it in an interview if im rigjt,btohqsg
but tbf he has 2 AMG Ones coming,btohqsg
so maybe need to make space,btohqsg
he said it doesnt handle that well,btohqsg
not cos he crashed it like twiceðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
so he sold it off for a mclarry or smtg,btohqsg
but i cldve sworn i saw somewhere he said he doesnt like how it handles,btohqsg
he owned it until very recently,btohqsg
i just did a quick search,btohqsg
the codalunga is a well handling car despite its length,btohqsg
was talking to a friend of mine who reviewed it on TopGear Singapore's blog,btohqsg
the fear factor is the cost of the car  that aside it handles amazingly,btohqsg
the huarya is a really good car for itâ€™s form factor,btohqsg
the car is a decade old,btohqsg
what do u do for a living,btohqsg
and yet it looks like it was born yesterday,btohqsg
these cars have aged very well,btohqsg
one car that i think honestly aged q bad,btohqsg
i think by the time the gt86 came out the design cues looked really similar,btohqsg
and itâ€™s starting not to look as new now,btohqsg
i think it's slightly showing its age,btohqsg
ignoring the fact that it sold like shit,btohqsg
itâ€™s that one hot aunty some families have,btohqsg
i blame yamaha for not selling it in VR46 colours,btohqsg
sorry i was thinking slightly old and good looking,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNorruob/hi guys whoever support gets 1 cent paynow frm me while stock lasts,btohqsg
there will for sure age well,btohqsg
compare the early 2010 e classes,btohqsg
the screen and buttons aged like shit,btohqsg
though the car has aged well,btohqsg
sorry mercedes electronics always age badly at this rate because of how fast we get improvements every year,btohqsg
the pre facelift W212 E63 looks very modern still,btohqsg
bugatti going with more buttons was a good note too,btohqsg
if the best or nothing why my friends mercedes air intake break in half,btohqsg
not air intake i forgot what itâ€™s called,btohqsg
