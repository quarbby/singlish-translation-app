Hey guys  so I just want like to gauge like the general opinion on the arts in Singapore here,btohqsg
What do you think of joining the arts industry,btohqsg
Arts scene is quite pathetic I guess,btohqsg
No money starve on the streets,btohqsg
And do you think we will be better off or worse off in 25 years,btohqsg
Or become an sph visual designer,btohqsg
Will definitely be better but I can't imagine it ever catching up with other jobs,btohqsg
There's not many jobs out there that uses arts directly,btohqsg
Nice  thank you for your insights,btohqsg
I recommend u apply to imda scholarship,btohqsg
Id say follow your dreams but like idk hows that worked out for others in sg,btohqsg
hahah I am really not interested in getting institutionalized,btohqsg
I recommend u look at it,btohqsg
And to someone who's so sceptical of shit,btohqsg
When I say good it's really good,btohqsg
I have considered it many times haha,btohqsg
Have you looked at the terms for imda yet?,btohqsg
I heard most govt scholarships arent that good,btohqsg
Look at it and decide after,btohqsg
I researched some cyber sec scholarship and people said dont go for it,btohqsg
Forgot which company but maybe imda,btohqsg
IMDA and NAC are both scholarships that I have researched thoroughly tbh,btohqsg
And my conclusion is that I rather do a local degree and launch things from the ground up,btohqsg
And how does serving half ur bond anywhere in the world sound like,btohqsg
I think most likely imda cause i havent heard of those 2,btohqsg
Imda is the only scholarship worth applying imo,btohqsg
The rest has 6 years of bs to serve,btohqsg
Meaning u can go Google in sv,btohqsg
That's still counted as serving bond,btohqsg
You dont need to directly work for them?,btohqsg
Ill look further into it then,btohqsg
That's why I say what I said,btohqsg
I'm gonna call it now lolThe arts is a death sentence if you go in by the narrow minded route of thinking that only a 4 years degree overseas that will set ur family back by S$500K in debts will let you succeed  and then you just try desperately to apply for jobs while falling into the tunnel vision mindset of jumping from waiter job to packer job while making half finished artwork that never sells on the marketThe arts is not a death sentence if you are extremely proactive in getting your community to band together and make projects that people can recognise  and you know how to market things and turn it into a regional household name. Singapore arts is suffering from A LOT of problems... from a low public opinion to low industry morale  but like all other problems  this one can be solved too. Yes it's going to take a lot of people and a lot of energy on our part and there will be so many skeptics along the way but if someone can lift a 3rd world country out of poverty in one generation  surely we can lift the arts industry out of this downwards spiralI guess what I'm trying to say is that there is hope for our arts industry  and because I believe in it  I'm going to throw in my lot,btohqsg
I didn't read everything but gonna give u kudos just cos of ur final sentence,btohqsg
I believe this is indicative of the investing industry as well. Too many investors just wanna get their IRR quick  but investing in impact requires patient capital and alot of support,btohqsg
Indeed  the arts is not a stable route. I mean  we all know that lah... but it's an industry  and like every industry that has ever been created  only the most active and hardcore people make it to the top. Even then  the average arts graduate will generally be able to find employment within the industry  it's a matter of whether they are willing to fight for it and create their own opportunities where there are none,btohqsg
I've utmost respect for ppl in arts. I don't want to conflate the economic value to its inherent value for beauty; that's insult,btohqsg
One of the really cool things about art right is that it's making something from nothing. I can bring a bunch of actors together and have nothing more than an iPhone  and if we collaborate on a script  practise together  make it good and edit it out on iMovie  we have a film,btohqsg
I won't even care for its industry. Ppl who make it big big-time make it posthumously,btohqsg
This is a big group so I'm not promising anything here  but yes we are planning something haha,btohqsg
Eh let's stay away from naming certain brands,btohqsg
I like my Android and Adobe,btohqsg
Haha just saying something that's accessible and recognisable to most people,btohqsg
you mean the surname Tan isit,btohqsg
They have their value and appeal to certain audience la,btohqsg
Personally I am determined to walk the tightrope between artistic social value and commercialism,btohqsg
I mean  American films... look at them. How are they able to be so commercially viable and yet culturally influential at the same time? Simple  don't lose your 初心 --- don't lose track of what you started out as,btohqsg
The certain youtuber he sort of fell into that trap of personal gain... the content is created just to boost his youtube revenue. Nothing wrong with that  he has his fans  but he won't be winning any awards for SG.,btohqsg
Then again not all change is bad,btohqsg
I mean change isn't bad if it's for the better,btohqsg
