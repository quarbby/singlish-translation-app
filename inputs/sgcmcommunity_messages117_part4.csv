You sure it‚Äôs the right Aaron?,btohqsg
Those buying Conti from C&C please be warn. My experience with them not very good. My Citroen C4 Picasso engine keeps ‚Äúmisfiring ‚Äú as they claimed and kept tweaking on the software throughout warranty period. Fellow Citroen I know shared C&C made repaired work on similar issues right after warranty period  of course with charges and downtime ! Think it‚Äôs not right as they should resolve within warranty period and not after just to charge customers. Lack of good faith.,btohqsg
so $5 nowhere near enough to eat nasi padang,btohqsg
Next MONTH I TAKE IT BACK HAHA,btohqsg
Change to new car before the warranty period ends,btohqsg
Arf for ice car higher than hybrid? So if end of the 10yr scrap  the arf take back for hybrid is far lower than for ice?,btohqsg
theoretically yes  because the hybrid or electric cars gets cevs rebate on the arf. up to 20k less i believe,btohqsg
u take back less  but u also paid less. in fact it is better for you.e.g both ice and the hybrid cars cost 100k and arf value is 20k. but hybrid entitles to 10k rebateice u pay 100k and get back 10k (50% of 20k)  depre = 9khybrid u pay 90k and get back 5k (50% of 20-10k)  depre  = 8.5k,btohqsg
i believe that is the calculation,btohqsg
But I believe 1st buyer can always earn the relief by placing a premium when selling in 2nd hand car market,btohqsg
I did. Just when warranty ends. Guess what  no dealer wanna take in locally. Done when French cars. Also with C&C no more! Lousy after sales service!,btohqsg
in an ideal world  the engineers are Germans.. french as lovers.. italians as chef...,btohqsg
honestly  french car not popular in Singapore  so most dealers wont take them in,btohqsg
