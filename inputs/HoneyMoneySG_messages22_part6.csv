Any credit limit set that may have prevented successful transfer?,btohqsg
Hellos. If maxed SA  alre FRT/ERR still can top up 2.5k to MA to get tax relief?,btohqsg
hi sorry im new to buying t-bills. for the recent t-bill  I got a 'discount' credited to my bank account but previously  i got a refund  no 'discount' credited. when i calculated the refund amount  it seems the 'discount' for the t-bill is lesser than what i should have gotten. may i ask who/how i can seek assistance for this?,btohqsg
discount = interest.Think of tbills as fixed deposit with interest paid to u upfront.refund = amount u applied for but didnt get,btohqsg
No  i have sufficient limit. I used it yesterday without any issues. But today my transactions got declined.,btohqsg
i get that sometime  usually works on the 2nd try. My best guess is their tech is not very good and the failure happen due to some backend api failure.,btohqsg
I tried 3x today and was unsuccessful. Quite embarassing and in the end i paid with other cards so as not to hold up the queues.,btohqsg
i suspect amaze might have an issue with that particular shop.,btohqsg
Thanks! But I only received the refund  no discount. That's why I'm worried,btohqsg
SGS REFUND -> refund coz they didnt allocate to youSGS DIS/PRE REFUND -> discount aka interest,btohqsg
Hmm.. no idea. Amaze said txn was rejected by citi though. Will call up citi to enquire tmr.,btohqsg
how much did u applied for and how much did u get allocated for? if u can share those  prehaps we can help u figure out.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if top up both VCMA + RSTU/SA  can my relief go beyond 8k/year?,btohqsg
I applied $20 000 and got refunded $5291.75. This was for the 3.9percent tbill in November,btohqsg
Most probably you made a non competitive bid  ie you took whatever rate that came from the auction. The allocation for non competitive bidders is fixed. If there were more bidders than allocated  then everyone will get only partial allocation  with the non allocated portion refunded to you.,btohqsg
i suspect u got allocated 15k291.75 / 15000 = 0.01945since its 6 months  u need to multiply by 20.01945 = 0.0389 = 3.89%5k is to refund u for the amt they cant allocate u,btohqsg
u can log into cdp to see the exact amt u are allocated for,btohqsg
Wise is the most cost effective when you consider purely its spot market exchange rate + fees excluding any form of cash back / credit card. For cashback use amaze + amex,btohqsg
sorry im not sure how to see from CDP webpage,btohqsg
BS21223S is the Tbill.  150 is the qty. each 1 qty represent 100 so it works out to 15000https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/auctions-and-issuance-calendar/auction-t-bill?issue_code=BS22123S&issue_date=2022-11-29,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks so much for your help!!,btohqsg
Wise is more expensive than Revolut and YouTrip in general,btohqsg
Hey how long did ur hsbc revo take to arrive? I just applied so trying to time my big purchase,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcurious if you have the time to show how to do the 1c Put option to fulfil the webull promo. Option noob,btohqsg
Why is it not 1.7%? ðŸ˜… Based on point of top up? (So long as before 15 Jan 2023),btohqsg
Yep. Based on milelion's understanding all topups before 15th Jan shld be the regular 1.7%,btohqsg
Hi may I ask how much of the OA can you invest in t bill  issit based on the stock investment limit of the cpfia  many thanks in adv for answering,btohqsg
Did you get the 4.7% cashback for 2nd and 3rd atome payment?,btohqsg
u can invest your entire cpfia,btohqsg
Just bought something last week with Atome. Need to wait for next few months haha,btohqsg
Since no more benefits topup YouTrip  should I just use trust debit card  0.2% benefit   no need to topup and the exchange rate almost similar,btohqsg
Planning go to Indonesia for 5 days,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask  if i have over 60k in my cpf  will i get the additional 1% interest?example OA = 35k  SA = 20K  MA = 20KIs it OA will cap at 20K for 1% additional  the remaining 40k from SA/MA will also have 1% additional?,btohqsg
Haven't used trust overseas  but seems slightly better than youtrip from your analysis. A good option if u don't have instarem amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Cannot. FRS includes invested amount as well,btohqsg
Hi allNeed to clear some doubts regarding SRS.Can we still transfsr to SRS for tax relief if we hit FRS with a total of OA and SA of more than 192K(eg 100k oa  100k sa),btohqsg
Yes  as long as MA below BHS,btohqsg
Cannot for self. Another 8k to parents/grandparents,btohqsg
SRS has nothing to do with CPF  so yes,btohqsg
FRS only considers SA balance  not OA,btohqsg
I was told that i cannot contribute to SRS if i hit FRS. It will not help to reduce my tax. The confusion part js the FRS component,btohqsg
I see. I was told by a agent its a total of SA and OA. Anythjng above 192k i should not do SRS.,btohqsg
U were given incorrect info. Frs or cpf has nothing to do with srs,btohqsg
Ok. Saw the link above and will go watch it,btohqsg
Newbie to this whole stuff. Can i seek the advise if we should do SRS first or SA topup if we have limited cash?,btohqsg
Main aim is to reduce my income tax,btohqsg
I guess it's to do with how much returns you are confident of achieving with SRS over the long term. If greater than 4% returns  then SRS.,btohqsg
Apologies my mistake. It should be topup to SA.,btohqsg
Another point to consider is liquidity needs. You can withdraw from SRS anytime (with a fee if withdrawn before retirement age) whereas if in CPF  you can't withdraw at all until age 55 if you meet the BRS.,btohqsg
So for my example SA topup should still be possible since my SA(100k) itself is below FRS(192k). Is that correct.Apologise for the confusion.,btohqsg
