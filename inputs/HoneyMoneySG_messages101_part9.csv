Yup how to destroy the old card,btohqsg
Hi everyone! I am currently paying SP utilities through UOB Amex card. After the nerf  I was thinking of switching to another card.I saw the Maybank Platinum Visa Card and was thinking of using it for my insurance payments as well as utilities  but am confused by this part. I'm aiming for the $30 cashback.They say that maximum monthly spend on insurance is $150  and insurance only counts as half payment.1) So does this mean monthly I can only spend $150 or is it $300 on insurance?2) Are there any other cards that can cover both insurance and utilities payment?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Hi All  has anyone recently tried adding new cards to Instarem Amaze and got this message? trying to add my UOB cards but unable to,btohqsg
Monthly only 150 on insurance will count toward the cashback,btohqsg
Ahhh I see. Are there any other cards that can be used for both insurance and utilities that you can recommend?,btohqsg
You can use cardup to bypass the exclusion at a fee (still net positive for cashback).,btohqsg
Does anyone here use the standard chartered smart credit card just fr simplygo?,btohqsg
Hmmm interesting   dbs wwmc refused to waive my annual fee,btohqsg
Yeah known issue with Uob cards and amaze recently. Both parties pushing to each other with no solution yet.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtdid they waive ur wwmc fees? ðŸ˜•,btohqsg
I also didnâ€™t manage to get it waived last year and I proceeded to cancel.,btohqsg
For those paying insurance premiums etc  are there specific banks or cards that allow u to have rebates/Cashback or clock as expenses,btohqsg
Is it worth still fr the cashback if just use for simplygo mthly in your opinion?,btohqsg
Wah even u couldnt get it  so i guess they gave him some special privileges even tho he didnt manage to meet the min spending. UOB is a much nicer bank than DBS,btohqsg
In the past I used to get it waived  only last year they decided to be annoying haha. But good riddance  I realised I donâ€™t really need that card in my wallet.,btohqsg
Maybank Platinum Visa and HSBC Everyday Global Account.ALWAYS READthe T&C's and find out how each cashback programmes work before making changes to your current set-up.,btohqsg
for hawker payment ...any ways to earn rebate?,btohqsg
my xnap suddenly dun recog my mastercard in gpay,btohqsg
Just used it actually via applepay  totally fine.,btohqsg
Hi I'm new here  just curious for new customer on webull on the current promotion  we can get 7NVDA share instantly when we deposit 500 and traded once?Further 15NVDA for 2k deposit?,btohqsg
Got such thing meh? 2k deposit for 15 nvd shares is US$13500 based on $900 price,btohqsg
2k for $13.5k better than strike toto,btohqsg
I saw it on the their website,btohqsg
Which is why I want to confirm lol,btohqsg
I think got catch coz got *,btohqsg
1 share refers to 1 chance according to this table - i.e. you could just get 15 x USD10 with 15 chances,btohqsg
Each worth 10-500 so can be full share or fractional share lol,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the best way to sign up for Krisflyer uob ccDirect with uob or Sing saver?Iâ€™m an existing uob cc user,btohqsg
Got gacha element haha  got it! Thanks!,btohqsg
Singsaver has a btr deal i think,btohqsg
Has anyone tried the bigfundr 6% thing? Read mixed reviews bout it online ðŸ™Š,btohqsg
Think must read TNC fr it. Moneysmart has offer too i believe,btohqsg
@kelvintaninvestcovered this before on his channel,btohqsg
Yes i saw  seems very good offer hmmm,btohqsg
Umm how is it a good offer? Technically you are taking the risk of the property with fixed upside and while there is a guarantee  there is no guarantee the guarantor will pay up,btohqsg
Urgent: Hi guys  UOB krisflyer card  can book tickets for parents?,btohqsg
Why not? But is sia flight right,btohqsg
Scoot flight ðŸ™‚ so is via the UOB Scoot portal for free baggage for them,btohqsg
I think there is some change of benefit for uob krisflyer so u better check before booking,btohqsg
Yes a bit of change. Just want the baggage lor haha. 5kg free,btohqsg
? Whats the guarantor for if it doesn't guarantee the payment?,btohqsg
I'm saying i don't know if the guarantor has the capacity to repay in an event of default.,btohqsg
As always  better not to invest if u are not comfortable with the risks. Got way easier to understand investment than this,btohqsg
Hi   monthly  i use debit card or nets / netsflash play / grab pay to pay 600 dollor for my kids music school . How can i can get the cash back or miles ?  they are not accept credit card or bank transfer .  Only accept paynow use UEN No. Thanks,btohqsg
What does this $5 block means,btohqsg
You're probably left with 0.3% cashback on UOB Absolute AMEX for Grab Wallet top-ups.,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm having difficulty linking my UOB prvi miles to amaze card. Anyone faced the same issue,btohqsg
I suggest you refer to the card's t&c instead.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how long must I stay with GIGA before I can port out to another telco?,btohqsg
