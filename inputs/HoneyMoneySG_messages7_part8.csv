I am trying to get some S&P 500. Which broker have lowest fee?Also read need to get from London exchange (15%) to avoid the 30% tax. Right?,btohqsg
Trillions in value erased: Only eight companies (of the 500 in the index) are responsible for nearly half of the weighted benchmark's year-to-date losses. Declines at Netflix (NFLX) have reached 70%  Meta (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA) are each down 43%  while Microsoft (MSFT)  Apple (AAPL)  Amazon (AMZN)  Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have fallen between 23% and 36% YTD. Under a theoretical model  if S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPGI) (CME) designed an equal weighting to the entire S&P 500  the index would only be down 13% in 2022 (but investors would also not have experienced the massive gains they notched in previous years).,btohqsg
