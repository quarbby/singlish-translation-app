I realise it is actually impossible to earn 4.6% paOnly above $500k get 3.6%. Below gets 3.5%.And only max amount of $360k gets bonus 1%.So I dunno what HSBC is smoking.,btohqsg
Tag to credit card spending also,btohqsg
hi all   is converting Linkpoint to Krisflyer miles worth it?,btohqsg
1 link point one cents if redeem at fair price merchants.. u see what your valuation is?,btohqsg
If I have not activated a credit card  the bank will not be able to charge annual fees on the card right?,btohqsg
Hi all  to get the bonus points for stanchart smart card I just have to add the card to SimplyGo and use Apple Pay and tap gantry with the smart card?,btohqsg
Hi guys. For uob signature Visa card 4mpd is awarded from fulfilling $1000 overseas spend and $1000 local contactless  spending. Qns if I spend locally $2000 using contactless will I get 4000miles or 8000 miles instead?Thanks.,btohqsg
Will I get charge annual card credit fee if I rcv the card but never activate it?,btohqsg
Then why you applied the card?,btohqsg
I thought today is snack promo for receiving the capitalmall evoucher?,btohqsg
Was a mistake. Haha thought Amex uob true Cashback can get cashback on insurance but not really as stated in the brouchure,btohqsg
Forget the time. Tot is 15th Apr. ü§£,btohqsg
Hi  how do I do fractional trading for ETF like SCHD on moomoo? I remember there's a odd lot function or something right?,btohqsg
So effectively spend $400 get $150 off  (unless you can withdraw the $150 cashback as cash?)won't be enough to hit the voucher rebatesDecent deal if you already are an existing DBS cardholder,btohqsg
If it is mistake  then you should call the bank to cancel the card. We cant really predict how a bank operates when it comes to fee charging.,btohqsg
They will still charge as it‚Äôs system generated  but you can waive it off easily since it‚Äôs not activated nor used,btohqsg
I think they will not charge. I have one with citibank.Anyway  if they charge  you can just ask for a waiver or close the card.,btohqsg
Is it first year AF free?,btohqsg
Debit card doesn‚Äôt have annual fee generally  right?,btohqsg
If we are doing in-app purchases (Lazada  shopee  etc)  can we just use crmc alone without amaze?,btohqsg
Here's a comparison of the reward rate compared to cashback (from Minstant app). It uses 1 mile = 1.25cents for calculation,btohqsg
Have anyone faced issues with Cashback for uob one credit card.I signed up for the card in Jan (approved on 26jan)And got my first cash back recently but it seems too low...My first month it's prorated because they say the follow standard default cycle on 12th of the month (can be changed but I didn't)I hit all the requirements but some how I only got 33.33 CashbackExclude all the additional cash back and enhanced Cashback(promo additional Cashback) I have like 150 of shoppe purchase on the Feb month and 1k on the march oneBut only got 15 dollar additional  and 20 dollar enhanced don't think I hit the cap or anything.Any idea if I find discrepancy where should I file or clarify with uob?,btohqsg
33.33 means it is for 2 months (2/3 of $50 for $500 tier). So you joined for 2nd (before 12-Feb) and 3rd (before 12-Mar) months of your quarter. And latest month (13-Mar to 12-Apr) was your first month of your second quarter.,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to share with us your calculation n how much you think you shall get.,btohqsg
Cashback comes with your statement for your first month of the next quarter. It doesn‚Äôt come at the end of the quarter  you‚Äôll need to wait 1 more month.,btohqsg
Some do. Best not to assume  and check specifically,btohqsg
UOB One debit card has. Check your card's t&c.,btohqsg
That's smth I would like to confirm too.Issue is the additional cash back and enhanced CashbackIhave 150 on shoppe on Feb (additional =150*5%= 7.5Enhanced = 10.01)And 1045 on march statement(Additional =1045*5%=52.25Enchanced = 1045 *6.67 = 69.7)That would easily be close to 100(in total cap at 100 each for addtional and enhanced pee statement month),btohqsg
I saw this in the TNC but I alr got the cashback credited that's why I am confused,btohqsg
Quarter 1:26-Jan to 12-Feb (2nd month)13-Feb to 12-Mar (3rd month)Quarter 2:13-Mar to 12-Apr (1st month and here you receive the cashback for Quarter 1)13-Apr to 12-May (2nd month)13-May to 12-Jun (3rd month),btohqsg
Actually weird lol. Your first month for first quarter like missing.,btohqsg
UOB is something hard to explain‚Ä¶I joined early January  yet January was counted as the 2nd month üòÇ and my statement date is 1st.,btohqsg
Ya this seems to be the case.. so only 2 months in the first quarter.,btohqsg
This is  annoying to track  Hahahahah,btohqsg
$1045 on 12-Mar statement or 12-Apr statement?,btohqsg
1145(sorry I got the amount wrong just now) posted 20th marchSo u maybe right,btohqsg
Then you‚Äôll receive the cashback on your 12-July statement,btohqsg
Ok I think Oscar is rightI saw the statement date 26jan to 12 Feb the statement classified under FebSo the first quarter is 13 Dec  2023 to 12 march 2024,btohqsg
Also there‚Äôs no $33.33 cashback tier. It is prorated from $50 üòÇ (2/3 of $50),btohqsg
One question thou TNC states thisThe Additional Cashback will be calculated based on the total amount of Selected Merchant Transactionssuccessfully charged and posted to the Card Account in each Statement Month  capped at S$100 per StatementMonth. The Enhanced Cashback is capped at additional S$100 per statement month.Does that mean during the cash back receiving  month  (let's say I capped full cashback all 3 month apr/may/jun  iwill get 300 for additional and enhanced  for the quarter or 100 in additional and enhanced  only),btohqsg
It says capped at S$100perStatement Month,btohqsg
