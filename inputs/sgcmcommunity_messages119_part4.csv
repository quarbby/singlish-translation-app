That one not likely I feel,btohqsg
Would more people be funnel to bid for smaller engine cars if they choose not to pay higher taxes for bigger engine cars? Will that affect the overall COE pricing?,btohqsg
cat B will likely continue to be in demand.. but what do I know.. 😬,btohqsg
They can afford to pay. What is 200k to them? Just chump change sia,btohqsg
Maybe more will start to look at cat A car ?,btohqsg
I worried that they might change to 20k next year .,btohqsg
He says there will be more room for tax in the upcoming year . So this yr the change is used as a test on the market just like last year. There is a shift in the purchasing power … if people continue to look at range of 20 001 - 40 000,btohqsg

Yupp  just that a small section might move from the mid level Merc/Audi/BMWs and go into japanese alternatives that have lower omv and therefore lower ARF but they'll still be taking up Cat B COE,btohqsg
Cat B will stay in demand still,btohqsg
Just that we'll start seeing even more bogo spec contis so as to fall under lower omv brackets such as c160s  e180s etc. 😔😔😔,btohqsg
One must remember that the new changes don't target engine size but omv,btohqsg
You have Mazdas with 2.5s with lower omv than contis with 2.0s,btohqsg
And there's high omv 1.6s in contis as well,btohqsg
So it's not a direct relation for the lower end of the market that brings in most volume  i.e the c class'  a4s  e class'  3 series,btohqsg
Year of make also play a part.,btohqsg
Pete will say  no need to waste money… can still drive on the road,btohqsg
Not quite  omv is simply the price of the vehicle when brought in  i.e. purchase price+shipping+insurance and logistics expenses,btohqsg
And purchase price is not settled by LTA,btohqsg
But by the manufacturer or the AD bringing in,btohqsg

I dun think so ...brand of cars is very important to conti crowd. they rather buy a low end conti than a high end Jap car.... look at the number of c180 on the road😂,btohqsg
