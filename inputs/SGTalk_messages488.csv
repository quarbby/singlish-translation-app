That why in other words  it's telling you not to make any wrong move. Once criminalised  very hard to be accepted into society.,btohqsg
Lip service. That's why when they talk about any initiatives is for u to do. Not for them,btohqsg
Like yellow ribbon. U hire not them. Like reduce carbon footprint. U take public transport. They own 2 cars.,btohqsg
They have to do something for people to see. Anything else  bo their tai ji liao,btohqsg
