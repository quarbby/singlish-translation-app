Morning I saw 1 person post a screenshot of 1 job. Then ask any1 do b4? Can advise? Piang. If scared then don't take. If take then don't scared,btohqsg
Valentino I kena few times. Initially when I took last Yr was ok. Then slowly they will keep cancelling. Then I stop taking,btohqsg
By the time  job gone  bo liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Actually quite easy de  good jobs will be gone before u blink eyes  fk type ones will stay waiting for suckers,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇnowdays good jobs I will always kena the lalabag/sticker msg  so I no chance get the good onesüòÇ,btohqsg
But also got good jobs nobody take  maybe is nobody near that pickup location,btohqsg
Or they already full liao so cannot takeüòÇ,btohqsg
Even with stickers n bag i also sometime see that,btohqsg
Oh u also will kena even if u have sticker?,btohqsg
Maybe my cancellation rate not good,btohqsg
I tot if u have sticker u still can complete the bid just depend on rating n distance,btohqsg
I got suggest customer to cancel or find other driver,btohqsg
For us no sticker  below will tell us leave the orderüòÇ,btohqsg
I got a feeling it's more of how close u are to the order,btohqsg
No need to write on the main chat which place etc good,btohqsg
Have u all come across Taste paradise order. If u got the job with tips. Please be aware. They usually book lalamove n another delivery platform to do their delivery order. So got 1 time i went. There was another driver collecting the same order. Then the manager said they also cancelled lalamove delivery. No choice i livechat with lalamove to get compensation. Today i took their order again. This time i was the only driver there. Before i left the manager ask me if i am from which platform.I wondering if is the case where they usually book 2 n see who comes first,btohqsg
Now I see alot of places last time always add money,btohqsg
Now don't need add money job gone,btohqsg
Cos got pple comment on chat where better to go,btohqsg
Yea bas tard sia  i kena once  but i bas tard them backüòÇ,btohqsg
Taste paradise is where. Actually I see 2 platforms doing this. Getz n the Chinese lettering one  the 1 which usually do for 313 sommerset Tanyu. Getz is the recent platform using llm. Even after u get their job  u have to be careful n monitor the job app. Sometimes they will either throw out another same order  but using bike if urs was car. Cheaper option. Will remain open all the way until u pick up ur order. If b4 that the cheaper option taken ur order is cancelled,btohqsg
The Chinese lettering 1 also do the same. There was 1 day  they had a few jobs at different restis at same time. They 1 time shoot out +20 or something. My friend took. Awhile later all cancelled,btohqsg
Then the come out job again,btohqsg
The 1 I kena. I reach there early. Told the resto. He check say cfm  say still preparing. I say ok cos I early. Then halfway thru. My job cancelled. I ask the resto  they say they nvr cancel. Then they go check  become another driver. Then llm call me. Say their customer  which is the platform  cancel my job. Wtf lor,btohqsg
Then the driver came  I check his job much much cheaper. Mine was +20  his was +2ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
That's y these type  now I can't b bothered to take liao,btohqsg
Yes  I call back the llm person. Demand the 50%. Then when they give me  it was without the +20. I say cannot. Must give me the 50% of full sum. To n fro few times then I got it.,btohqsg
Hit n miss. Sometimes can get sometimes cannot. See ur heng suay,btohqsg
Not the CS ganna sia. Some can come in. Before i can type they left,btohqsg
Then we are stuck as we no longer can type in live chat or even start a new one,btohqsg
When u want claim. Just go in livechat n type out what u want say. Then screenshot. Then when got time go in n check. Write what happen n say u want claim the fee. If the Cs come in no do anytg then leave  u can either start a new one or email llm. With the screenshot as proof that u already went thru cs but they don't so shit,btohqsg
Getz touches base w gogox also,btohqsg
That's why out of nowhere can get cancelled,btohqsg
Then these platforms always put on their remarks no need to call resto to confirm. I would say it‚Äôs a trick cos in case of double booking/cancellation llm will not compensate u if no call confirmation done. Regardless  i still call. Most of the time  they dont pick up the call.,btohqsg
Delivery Chinatown so far ok. In fact the last time they cancelled my order they called me very fast b4/after they cancel n apologise to me.,btohqsg
But take note was using a private number which I norm don't answer üòÇ,btohqsg
Getz n ÁîüÈ≤úÈ£üÂìÅ can't even b bothered to let us know,btohqsg
The 1 they cancelled was an order that had been left on the llm job app for a long time liao. Apparently was already picked up but wasn't cancelled in the app,btohqsg
Chinatown has so far been the better platform for me. They had a couple of times msg me asking how long I will take for pickup. After letting them know  they acknowledged and told me to drive safe. Did not rush me but guess cos I not that far when I took the job. And at least they have the decency to call me n let me know job cancelled n sorry. None of the other platforms bother to even inform me,btohqsg
Ok enough of my old man talesüòÇ,btohqsg
Many previous order require lalabagRecently bought the lalabagSlide the order yet still prompt you need lalabag.....ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Yah was thinkg of buying. Lucky no buy also,btohqsg
Yup I heard n saw b4 their fee low. So just like u take the spill over orders.,btohqsg

55 South Bridge Rd issit sakemaru? Nowdays I notice they use car job liao. If so can take but parking troublesome. Need park opposite so carrying will be troublesome,btohqsg
Think so! But the address is accurate  so I keep my Google Sheets of the deliveries to calculate distances and mileage on my bike etc,btohqsg
