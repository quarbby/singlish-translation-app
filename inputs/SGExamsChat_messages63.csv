even better if he mentions my username,btohqsg
All communications are embargoed for 24-48 hours as we search for moderators. There has been a very serious attempt at defamation and impersonation on various TG groups. Lockdown will be lifted shortly with enhanced surveillance. Will post some education related articles in the mean-time. Meanwhile  do invite friends and colleagues so that we can have a fruitful and healthy discussion to better the local educational landscape and amidst this difficult period. As a social responsibility drive  I am starting a free  1 hour General Paper  clinic on AQ for members and details will be announced soon with other members contributing more hours of free classes. Thank you and meanwhile do have a look at our other groups@sgexams,btohqsg
even better: gyrate on a bridge,btohqsg
I think CB period make u sot,btohqsg
i rlly wanna ask if eating a person out is vegan but i feel like neil will rip me apart,btohqsg
It’s a parody of the sgeducators guy,btohqsg
at that area above the GO porch,btohqsg
also u look rlly cute btw,btohqsg
Everytime i see this word idk why i read it as simian,btohqsg
she just really really wants to do the fucking,btohqsg

It’s really just this one girl,btohqsg
Agent smith what r u doingg doxxing others,btohqsg
i am a man of culture,btohqsg
Then you should use non-degeneracy talk to make sure the degeneracy talk doesn't float,btohqsg
I think it’s not excessively degen yet,btohqsg
man you people are fucking deprived,btohqsg
so thats why she gg crazy,btohqsg
John r u curious too ?,btohqsg
yes he is john is xmm,btohqsg
john i didnt know u had a boyfriend alrd !! wow !!@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
I am a woman of mysteries,btohqsg
There's all kinds of muscles though,btohqsg
Can you solve a problem for me,btohqsg
Is any1 doing that singing shit,btohqsg
"""he's the ignorant slut  but he aint my bb john""",btohqsg
John is so far removed from a xmm wtf,btohqsg
He's like a fucking dragonboating chad,btohqsg
Ppl in my block legit screamin,btohqsg
I don't hear ppl singing lmao,btohqsg
And they’re flashing lights out the window,btohqsg
Not gonna lie  this is pretty cool,btohqsg
Ur neighbours arent that cold eh,btohqsg
Ok now alot of ppl singing alrdy,btohqsg
why are there 2 johns in the group,btohqsg
I sang home during my choir performances so many times,btohqsg
I think I growing eyebrows sia  my neighbour shouting like mad dog or kenna thrown down 30 floors sia,btohqsg
Whole place is lit up with flashing lights,btohqsg
Walao they all screaming like corona infected their entire neighbourhood sia,btohqsg
Wow people are flashing lights from the rooftop,btohqsg
At least it’s not Air Force planes again,btohqsg
oh i think it ending alr,btohqsg
Now u know how ur neighbours are like,btohqsg
Lol wtf a flashlight is useless also,btohqsg
Walao now my neighbourhood kenna police baton haahah,btohqsg
Legit can burn paper w it,btohqsg
And u can keep it after pop?,btohqsg
ok imma go binge the good place now,btohqsg
almost as much as the office,btohqsg
the twitter account@sharonliew86has been deactivated :(,btohqsg
I only heard cheering and inaudible screaming,btohqsg
Hello chinese i am orang chinese,btohqsg
Hello orang Chinese I am woof,btohqsg
what happened to the free live concert,btohqsg
y'all read the news about the person behind@sharonliew86on Twitter got arrested,btohqsg
a 34yo man is behind that account,btohqsg
Very smart of the person who took that account username,btohqsg
Also  I didn’t realise sgfight and sgcovid were different groups,btohqsg
Only econs and math is interesting in that combi,btohqsg
When you need keep waiting for this you will understand the pain,btohqsg
wait til u see me working in google w a liberal arts degree!1!1!1!1!,btohqsg
U need programming skills like neil,btohqsg
I would say maths is the most interesting but it’s only H1,btohqsg
I’d have to go with Lit,btohqsg
I was planning to take BCMe,btohqsg
John will second major in lit,btohqsg
My programming skills are good okay,btohqsg
I wish lit questions would be posted on the study groups more,btohqsg
But we don’t have the culture for that,btohqsg
I skipped a lot of organic chem qns,btohqsg
Bro i was literally a meme in my schs chem dept for 2 yrs,btohqsg
Wtf organic chem is actually the easiest,btohqsg
I got f9 all the way in pure chem uwu,btohqsg
Only OG group members of this grp know,btohqsg
Ric is definitely an OG of SGExams,btohqsg
Who say rp must be >50 to study w him,btohqsg
That’s not a very high bar,btohqsg
U really want to hear ah,btohqsg
His opinions on poly remain undisclosed,btohqsg
Thats one lower than my bunkmate’s actual alevel rp,btohqsg
i forgot what my RP is leh,btohqsg
HAHA CFM HIGHER THAN ME LA MEDIC,btohqsg
Include pw how can only be 15,btohqsg
how much RP is a S,btohqsg
That one really is heck care,btohqsg
E is 10  S is 5 ah,btohqsg
lol went from degen to rp discussion,btohqsg
Once the degen leaves the conversation,btohqsg
but WE GOT SAME RP LMAO,btohqsg
I thought all science kids usually higher RP de,btohqsg
the good news is my parents will probably never find out,btohqsg
Arts subjects tutors mark alot more strictly in exam,btohqsg
My school’s honours roll always has way less arts than science,btohqsg
My friend did hybrid and got D for his science H1,btohqsg
I see ratio i think of gender ratio,btohqsg
Is it cuz your name is multiplied by 10 in the science side,btohqsg
When he would probably have gotten an B at least if he did an arts H1,btohqsg
rip this guy is not a true hybrid guy,btohqsg
FMaths class always has one of the most honours roll kids,btohqsg
Lowkey fleccsing being in the same klass as John means higher chance to get in Hons Rol,btohqsg
all in presence of the great John Smith may take up their slot in the honour roll,btohqsg
Is not cuz they fm is cuz you inside the class,btohqsg
Should have said VE RI TAS,btohqsg
Mfw all i have is : my spirit will never falter,btohqsg
I was just saying a Latin motto,btohqsg
My school’s motto is The best is yet to be,btohqsg
Swim alongside the dolphins for a bluer ocean,btohqsg
Do u know chanric is a more impt ques,btohqsg
He has failed in his quest,btohqsg
He’s an infamous guy online who was from CJC,btohqsg
He’s the kind of guy teachers tell stories about,btohqsg
wym all guys online from CJC are infamous,btohqsg
From what I know  it sounds like his nudes are online,btohqsg
maybe all the infamy doesn't stem from inherently bad things,btohqsg
Maybe it's society itself that's generating the infamy for its own insidious purposes,btohqsg
Y’all 2020 a levels or this year a levels?,btohqsg
2018 2019 and now 2020 again,btohqsg
A lot of people here are on the older side,btohqsg
But there are some A Levels kids too,btohqsg
Later when got a levels cfm the number of the a levels kids here will exponentially increase,btohqsg
We always get a spike in traffic near National exams,btohqsg
And then 90% of them leave after that,btohqsg
And a level result release also,btohqsg
Lots also join and just exist too,btohqsg
That’s how we have 2000 members,btohqsg
Cuz I struggling with Chem and bio and here good to ask qns,btohqsg
But Chem and bio still B anyways,btohqsg
FYI our A Levels questions corner is at@sgexamsstudiesas,btohqsg
This group is mainly for talking cock,btohqsg
Ull seldom get help for bio tho,btohqsg
Our resident bio god is mia,btohqsg
The only things that are hard to get help for here are the humanities,btohqsg
Those who are good at it probably never uses these groups,btohqsg
Or they come to these groups to answer questions to kill time,btohqsg
Do you mean to say  math ppl fking bored,btohqsg
I just dw my brain to rot in ns,btohqsg
I heard this year H2 math they took out co & regre,btohqsg
Vectors every year they set 15-20 marks leh,btohqsg
3 more co & reg qns 😂😂,btohqsg
My year they asked us draw scatter plot on graph paper,btohqsg
I dun even rmb my year’s co & reg qn,btohqsg
Complex now not much to troll,btohqsg
No more loci/ de movire theorem,btohqsg
I was confident in my complex until i did that ques,btohqsg
Ya they should take out vectors. Liddat no standard real number line  all work with fking abstract non-vectors material.,btohqsg
Now i have ptsd when i see “i”,btohqsg
Eh no they took our paper,btohqsg
I propose we all learn Magmas and Groupoids for JC students,btohqsg
Its ok u wont need to touch complex numbers in uni unless u do eee,btohqsg
Eng maths will have it again i think,btohqsg
But not too intense unlike the one in electrical engine,btohqsg
Complex numbers is the complete number system,btohqsg
It was a w a twist,btohqsg
I was kinda thinking about imaginary numbers,btohqsg
This statement feels like it's throwing pure math students under the bus because they don't exist,btohqsg
Technically real numbers are complex numbers,btohqsg
Ok i forgot about pure math,btohqsg
Imagine anyone wanting to do maths,btohqsg
Didn’t SEAB say they wanted math to gear more towards real life application,btohqsg
How dafuq they gonna apply imaginary numbers to real life,btohqsg
Okay time to increase my IQ,btohqsg
The type of qns are silly,btohqsg
Also  some differential equations require complex to solve,btohqsg
John has 5i apples and Mary has 9i+10 apples,btohqsg
2018 h2 math had it too lmao,btohqsg
Can apply that to irrational numbers too,btohqsg
The one in fmath is harder to solve,btohqsg
John has sqrt2 apples and Mary has sqrt3 apples,btohqsg
Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have irrational numbers,btohqsg
H2 was just showing that the solution was valid,btohqsg
No but sqrt 2 u might actually encounter,btohqsg
2nd order DE can be considered free marks,btohqsg
But like if I cut an isosceles triangle 2 sides 1cm the other side will be sqrt 2,btohqsg
But I can’t cut i cm triangles out what,btohqsg
It’s true that the imaginary unit is not really something you’d need in daily life,btohqsg
But daily life maths stops at like P5 anyway,btohqsg
Why did they invented it? :(,btohqsg
Ok so you don't like imaginary numbers?,btohqsg
Make the life of students harder,btohqsg
Let's use (A -B; B A),btohqsg
I enjoyed imaginary numbers but I probably just didn’t see it’s application at that time,btohqsg
Most of the mathematicians who discovered it thought it was rubbish too,btohqsg
Almost all chapters in the H2 math syllabus there have probably be one application qn with some context,btohqsg
But I don’t think I saw one application qn on complex tho,btohqsg
Pretty sure some prelim paper uses it,btohqsg
Maybe some SAJC teacher set b4 idk,btohqsg
That is true  I have never seen a question of ‘real life application’ of complex,btohqsg
Quantum can go complex and quaternion no problem,btohqsg
This year a level they set an electric circuit qn for complex numbers,btohqsg
I dun take physics or f math idk what u saying,btohqsg
But I’m sure it has its uses,btohqsg
Quantum in h2 physics is no longer fun,btohqsg
How do u know what they’re coming out with this year,btohqsg
