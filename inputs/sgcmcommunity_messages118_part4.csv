What is ur car… Tampines mall and century sq  both quite bad… Tampines one still ok,btohqsg
Tamp mall the entrance near the traffic light the turn very tight,btohqsg
That one even normal height car need to angle at times,btohqsg

But the exit of century sq is weird,btohqsg

Under 1.8 is the best height for SUV,btohqsg

More than 1.8 like the defender all a bit hard to live with,btohqsg
No… it’s the reversing part that almost kenna hit,btohqsg
