All stocks need a good theme to fry. In this case on ppe.If u can‚Äôt recognise the fact they thrive on a theme to garner public interest and the price swings are more lucrative than a straight line up for themIf u can‚Äôt recognize a theme is key to the frying u are at the wrong place,btohqsg
very easy to spot your shit,btohqsg
what ever you say liao toh liao? gone?means you are vested in shorting or sold,btohqsg

Wah now can't tag wayne le,btohqsg
Go back and read again the message please. Did it not say shit and below low class? You must be kidding if you think there is no demeaning intent.What is wrong in expecting a company to pay more dividend or reward investors better. Stock market is a place of greed. Anyone who thinks not is fooling himself. What is short term for you maybe long term for me.Every opinion is good for this forum but not the demeaning nature of comments.,btohqsg
yesterday i tagged wayne.he asked whycouldnt respond cause when for drinks with friends (very rare occasional for my age already),btohqsg

Thank you all.Lets move on guys,btohqsg
ytd really no time to point it out for you,btohqsg
I suppose you tag the wrong personI make no apology for my comments except to highlight I don‚Äôt refer to all who are investing in medtecs but the whining players daily. If u feel I‚Äôm referring to u then so be it it‚Äôs your own preference.As u said it‚Äôs their own opinion and this is mine. Whether I like what I say doesn‚Äôt matter. I respect you got your right to voice your thoughts. I just make it explicit on my distaste for the whining players.As for language  worse has been said on exchange management and bb. Don‚Äôt see anyone standing up for them so I  stand by my use of language. In this instance not sure your reaction is due to dislike of me or felt it‚Äôs being referred to u.Nevertheless I still respect it,btohqsg
