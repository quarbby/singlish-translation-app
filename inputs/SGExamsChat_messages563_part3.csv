a million dollars is so much money though,btohqsg
it cannot lose that much value,btohqsg
but probably best to invest some of it,btohqsg
then you get a bit of profit,btohqsg
thats what i would probably do,btohqsg
i mean i can acknowledge that for u and zl yalls still in sec sch so its understandable that maybe yall dh the same grasp of the world,btohqsg
if it's too much for you to comprehend  why the hell wouldn't you take the effort to comprehend it,btohqsg
being dumb and lazy is literally hindering you,btohqsg
isnt a million dollars a shit ton of money,btohqsg
to me a million is alot la,btohqsg
when you are a student and your pocket money is in dollars  10000 is also a lot,btohqsg
you could buy an average HDB and still have like a few hundred thousand left over,btohqsg
enough for a 85 yrs old,btohqsg
My idol Warren Buffett not retired at 90,btohqsg
not like you get 1mil and then stop working,btohqsg
I think honestly my mindset is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be bothered‚Äù‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt be bothered if I become homeless tmr  I can‚Äôt be bothered if I win the lucky prize of 4D‚Ä¶Whatever situation I‚Äôm face with  I‚Äôll just adapt and deal with it to the easiest life I can lead,btohqsg
but I'm already doing what I like  not too much diff from retirement,btohqsg
if youre not bothered by being homeless you probably need to get your mental health in check cos somethings definitely wrong,btohqsg
Not wrong. Yolo also a lifestyle,btohqsg
"no one just ""doesnt bother"" about being homeless",btohqsg
There's people out there who haven't grasped the idea of homelessness because they haven't been threatened by it before,btohqsg
So its not a mental health thing I would say,btohqsg
it's possible. I've friends near my age who are like this,btohqsg
with the social conditioning of this country it would be more plausible for it to be a mental healfh problem,btohqsg
but im not too sure also,btohqsg
but they aren't born with millions,btohqsg
Nah my parents told me they want me out the house by 25,btohqsg
My parents told me that whe I was 13,btohqsg
They said I want u out when u were 13,btohqsg
just can't fathom the idea of trying to lead your easiest life possible and being homeless when you could just yknow,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt blame people for the circumstances I‚Äôm in  I just accept and adapt,btohqsg
not needing to spend is also financially free,btohqsg
not necessarily. Being jailed for life also üòÇ,btohqsg
bc i kinda want that rn,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not dumb enough to not actively avoid being homeless‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just that the thought of it honestly don‚Äôt phase me.If I do  I‚Äôll just adapt‚Ä¶been doing that my whole life  always been inches from less desirable outcomes but I pull myself through by hook or by crook.Already mentioned i will selective choose when to put in the hard work,btohqsg
that's when you are thinking of just yourself,btohqsg
I can differentiate if my decisions affect someone else,btohqsg
the only differentiating you can do is dy/dx,btohqsg
If I know it affects I will take that into consideration‚Ä¶ eg( group project),btohqsg
The life i choose  the life I picked and will be the kind of life I endure,btohqsg
I decided this was how I was going to live my life at that age,btohqsg
Now you know why I‚Äôm confuse if I was sheltered or not,btohqsg
side note  got A lvl H2 Phy prac questions released anywhere ah?,btohqsg
why is money even a measurement of success,btohqsg
Can ask the physics jc chers,btohqsg
like... success is subjective and relative,btohqsg
Because we ascribe value to it,btohqsg
i rather cry in my bed,btohqsg
I wanted to say earlier that most of you prob have been lost at some point of your life ‚Ä¶but I know y‚Äôall prob never have been as lost as me in life.That I want to compete with the poorest of society,btohqsg
Bro just admit u are depressed,btohqsg
