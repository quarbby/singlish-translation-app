but weight difference will forever be an advantage wont it,btohqsg
Taycan look and perform like a super car with top end performance and luxury and comfort,btohqsg
Not easy to beat and it a sedan,btohqsg
taycan cant even compete with a base 911 or a F8,btohqsg
the car is just way heavier,btohqsg
for the taycan compared to the 911,btohqsg
Is it I thought the track timing is king now,btohqsg
weight distribution can be better but it is still extra weight haha,btohqsg

Hi! Would like to ask experienced car owners here. I’m buying my first car. I’m in a dilemma.1. Toyota Vios 1.5A E  45k mileage2. Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6A  110k mileageConsidering all else the same. Eg. Price  years of COE left  depreciation. Both are manufactured in 2010.Which would you choose (1 or 2) and why?Many thanks! 😀,btohqsg
I would go with the vios because of the lower mileage but before making a decision I would put them through a PPI and make sure there's no hidden wear and tear or issues to be fixed and the mileage isn't tampered with,btohqsg
Appreciate your response Arnav!May I know what’s a PPI?Looking forward to more opinions as well.,btohqsg
Basically it’s like a medical check up,btohqsg
Would AA be the best place to go?,btohqsg
We can’t give you an exact shop,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.Looking forward to hearing more opinions on the 2 choices,btohqsg
Hahaha I’m just sharing deals that I found for all drivers out here,btohqsg
Maybe the 45 k mileage is fake,btohqsg
Nope  AA doesn't do thorough inspections,btohqsg
Would an inspection be able to pick up on whether the mileage number is fake?,btohqsg
Vicom and sta are good base inspections,btohqsg
In case you want an in depth inspection go to a workshop that deals with a lot of Toyotas and Hondas,btohqsg
I see. Do you happen to have a workshop recommendation?,btohqsg
Honda specialist should be able to give Toyotas a go,btohqsg
There’s alot actually and depending on your budget,btohqsg
Here's some suggested by sgcm team,btohqsg
If the dealer is not very keen on the inspection  walk away from the deal,btohqsg
Or they only wanna go to their preferred workshop,btohqsg
Usually those dealers aren't the best to deal with if there are any issues with the car after purchase as well,btohqsg
If they say only vicom or sta  that's still ok,btohqsg
Just that these two centers probably can't check for Odo tampering,btohqsg
Idw other shop touch my car,btohqsg
What if drop from the lift,btohqsg

I wouldn't recommend an EV for your first car,btohqsg
Still not there yet for EVs to be great for everyone,btohqsg
And if you get an extremely old EV there can be issues with the battery pack,btohqsg
Actually idea also   you won’t know that is petrol kiosk   what is servicing .,btohqsg
You will know very well all the charging points tho  probably spend an hour there when everyone is carrying on with their day 🤣,btohqsg
Nice to have a car to go grocery shopping with,btohqsg
