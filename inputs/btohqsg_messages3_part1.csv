Depend on did you take grant from HDB for your current hse.,btohqsg
If yes   you consider 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Is better for you to check on hdb web side.,btohqsg
I might be wrong also   as hdb ruling keep changing.,btohqsg
Thanks xw and Ivan. Never taken grant  so 1st timer here.,btohqsg
"""And if so I must apply for those that expected TOP on or after my current MOP right?"" -> trying to say that if I apply  that BTO must TOP after my current flat's MOP of 5 years. (still serving halfway)",btohqsg
Can only non-mature for my case as apply under Singles Scheme (think also 5% allocation),btohqsg
first thing to take note  though grant is free money from the gahmen  it can only be deposited into your CPFOA  can be used for down-payment too. but once you sold your house  you have to put the grant back PLUS 2.5% accrued interest,btohqsg
for others who are thinking to get resale  if you have plan to BTO in the future  then consider not to take the grant so that you can have first timer chance  take  the grant when your BTO is successful lol,btohqsg
yes well noted on the accrued interest  i used CPF for private property umpteenth times.,btohqsg
erm this is what the system generated not me lol  think whenever someone gives thumbs up or + this happens,btohqsg
Hello. Can I know if I able to increase the HLE?,btohqsg
Last 4 years they say will review the loan. Just received the latter but did not increase or review the loan amount.,btohqsg
tiagong the amount is 65x of your combined salary,btohqsg
either your pay is lower or the same as 4 years ago,btohqsg
Last 4 years only using my wife cpf. Cos I just started working less than a year.,btohqsg
After 65X by right should get higher amount. But they did not ask me to update or anything. Still same loan amount.,btohqsg
as long as work 3 months  conservatively to qualify for loan  probably they are taking your combined pay as average,btohqsg
I will to know if there will more bto at clementi mall?,btohqsg
I am first timer and a lot of things I do not understand if my income ceiling is not high  am I still able to purchase bto for single?,btohqsg
income ceiling for single capped at $7k,btohqsg
but only for 2rm at non mature estate,btohqsg
Has anyone studied the 'increase rate' of SBF pricing vs BTO?,btohqsg
And how much they are really pegged to 'market'? (is there such a thing as market price of SBF in first place),btohqsg
never studied but I only know one 3rm unit in geylang costs $30k more than during the BTO launch in 2017,btohqsg
and it'd be TOP in a year,btohqsg
RE: Whether SBF is really pegged to market pricing.,btohqsg
https://t.me/bidadaribtounless you want to create specially for Nov 2020 ones! :),btohqsg
Hi anyone know by when sale of balance flats results will be in,btohqsg
I have not receieved any letters or email,btohqsg
Dear bto experts  may I know which non matured town u would recommend for BTO in  to have easiest travel to Dakota mrt (by public transport)?,btohqsg
Hougang would be the nearest non mature town followed by Sengkang and punggol,btohqsg
what are you doing at Dakota anyway?,btohqsg
My parents 2rm short lease is there.,btohqsg
I want to be as near as possible  without breaking the bank.,btohqsg
oh I hope my mum gets her sbf in geylang too,btohqsg
for sbf  you can't choose your desired area  Macpherson  circuit rd  etc are under geylang,btohqsg
so hope my mum gets a very low number,btohqsg
so that she can get to choose Dakota,btohqsg
Ur mom doesn't like circuit rd/macpherson area?,btohqsg
Yes see quite a lot sbf left there. But quite ex,btohqsg
she only wants a place where it is like 5 mins walk to the wet market,btohqsg
I love the 2 hawker ctr of circuit rd estate. Too bad if I buy there I would have to die there and end the property game over,btohqsg
Is like almost all built 1969 1970 1971,btohqsg
there is Macpherson spring BTO which the residents moved in 6 months ago,btohqsg
the BTO plot next to Macpherson MRT of May 2021 is good,btohqsg
2rm of 30 years SBF at Macpherson spring is $130k,btohqsg
yes I shared the same thought at first,btohqsg
but realized it's only for 30 years,btohqsg
Oh u mean 30yrs balance. Not 30yo,btohqsg
