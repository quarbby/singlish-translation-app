but if you are dead sure of what u kinda want to do and u like the idea of consistent effort then go for poly,btohqsg
Go EJC if u don't want to take econs (EJ Econs is horrible),btohqsg
H2 geog has double the distinction rate of h2 econs,btohqsg
Even though h2 geog has like a significantly lower national distinction rate,btohqsg
either way I mean ur end goal is to go uni and do whatever u want if you already have the goal then u can plan according to that also,btohqsg
He too busy gasing himself up,btohqsg
legit half of the ppl donâ€™t wanna stay in stem,btohqsg
Wait what's the national dist rate for,btohqsg
Most recent year where resulsts were released is 2018,btohqsg
also wtf h2 geography is 37.5%,btohqsg
I mean if u go jc and fuck up,btohqsg
not as bad as going poly and fuck up,btohqsg
I will be brutally honest abt my thoughts towards EJ and the reasons why EJ Econs department needs to be improved,btohqsg
i am not the sample size,btohqsg
YIJC econs may be better than EJC,btohqsg
EJC deadass didnt even teach one whole topic,btohqsg
who puts a not as good teacher as band 8 and a good teacher in band 1,btohqsg
they probs wanna maintain the higher scorers,btohqsg
its to cater to different needs,btohqsg
i got into band 5 for 1 sem,btohqsg
those who are alr in bottom bands are prolly those who are like failing,btohqsg
goal is for them to pass,btohqsg
snd then they decided to take average n put me back to band 8,btohqsg
Those who are in high bands is to maintain the A,btohqsg
the top 5 performing classes for EJ,btohqsg
and oh my god i not even looking at the teacher in band 8 i can answer qn..,btohqsg
3 of them have no econs students,btohqsg
2 of them are the HSP classes,btohqsg
my batch tm did banding for math after prelims,btohqsg
all it takes is 1 sem to be fucked over,btohqsg
if i had the bsnd 5 teacher all over i would hsve liked econs,btohqsg
if i get l1r5 8 v hard get into hwachong rj,btohqsg
so iw go ejc or poly,btohqsg
you go see the modules u learn in np,btohqsg
This is totally not a biased source,btohqsg
basically they split into diff classes based on prelim results,btohqsg
because the average score for EJC Prelims is 37.5% ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I heard toxic and back stabbing,btohqsg
