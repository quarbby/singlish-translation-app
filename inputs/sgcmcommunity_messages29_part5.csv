This is trickery. Easiest to look at upfront costs of car and recurring roadtax. Iâ€™m the case of Malaysia. None. For 5 years,btohqsg

Honda Fit I love you !!!,btohqsg
Honda. The style is hard for me to love.,btohqsg
u only love Mazda n alfaðŸ˜›,btohqsg
No la. For Honda itâ€™s s2000 styling. Beautiful lines and proportions.,btohqsg
I also like Lancia delta lines. Beautiful. Integralle. Subaru copied the style.,btohqsg
For Honda itâ€™s the engine tech that shines,btohqsg

So far I met vezel with rs sticker more Siao Lang,btohqsg
Yes. Correct. Proton  likes Alfa a lot. Admires very much. When the selespeed button first came out  proton also copied this. Hilarious. Alfa is the first to come out with semi auto box like that used in F1. Then bmw saw this and followed with smg,btohqsg
