Need to transfer in 2k every month right ?,btohqsg
Yes. And transfer out 5 times.,btohqsg
hey  I would like to ask if is citi premier the best general spend card for my use case? I use it for cardup payments (insurance  rent)  large ticket spend and when i exceed 1k on citi rewardsam considering the uob prvi miles but scared i'm unable to accumulate enough uob$ for miles redemption,btohqsg
Are you getting it bcuz non expiring miles?,btohqsg
Consider dbs altitude. Citi premier miles has worse miles earn rate and higher cardup fee.Uob prvi aint too bad if you have other uob cards. You will earn enough to redeem before the expiry.,btohqsg
Hi can check with you how long did you wait before receiving this message? I submitted last Sat. Until now still no response yet.,btohqsg
This is the 1% and the Rewards program (NOT THE BONUS INTEREST)There is no need to submit anything.,btohqsg
I transferred 2k then do 5 transactions of $1 to other bank. But i didn't receive any messages from HSBC that i qualify,btohqsg
HSBCSG (1/2) Thanks for qualifying for Everyday+! Enjoy 1% cashback on eligible spends and GIRO bill payments plus 1% p.a. bonus interest until 30SEP2024.,btohqsg
Kris+ no need to wait for anniversary month,btohqsg
But not all spend will qualified for $500 spend,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows if ZYM mobile can apply for Giro payments to EGA?,btohqsg
UOB One Account interests I received 503.21 on 2 Aug aster the change . Still not too bad.,btohqsg
I just enrolled for OCBC 360 Account . Hope can achieve the Spending and savings criteria,btohqsg
OCBC Salary Save Spend only earn 394.94 apparently,btohqsg
Seems correct assuming you have 100k. Though it may not make sense to keep 100k in ocbc due to reset month.,btohqsg
One of the best accounts now. Just behind HSBC EGA,btohqsg
"Could u elaborate what you mean about this ""reset month""?",btohqsg
If you check out the table in the orginal#ocbc360eirmessage  there's a range of ideal amounts your MAB should be at. And there'll be a reset month required to stay within the range.,btohqsg
Any recommendations to transfer the 100k out to if it does not make sense to keep in ocbc?,btohqsg
Dont need to take out the entire 100k. Look at#ocbc360eirby admin Melvyn for a range of ideal MAB. Just withdraw to stay within the range.,btohqsg
Does UOB privi have a  spending cap on foreign currency purchase?,btohqsg
Isit better to get the master card version and pair it with Amaze?,btohqsg
Not really. Pairing master ver with amaze doesnt earn u anymore values. Amaze is best paired with 4mpd/3mpd cards. Imo  uob prvi visa is best as its highest mpd card for cardup.,btohqsg
What about overseas spend? It helps to convert to reduce fx right?  and earn uncapped 2.4mpd overseas,btohqsg
This is where u got wrong. Amaze converted overseas to local spend so you only get 1.4mpd. Not worth paying amaze spread for that.,btohqsg
Ohh so for overseas spend‚Ä¶ amaze +crmc is still the best choices cause of the lower fx fees + 4mpd (but not uncapped)?,btohqsg
Hihi  sorry I'm pretty new to credit cards  what's cardup? How does that work with uob prvi visa?,btohqsg
For mile earning purpose yes. If you are expecting to go over 1k limit when spending overseas  consider adding UOB lady (esp dining) to ur collection. UOB lady can be paired w amaze and avoid hitting cap on crmc.,btohqsg
TLDW: a way to pay for expenses that are usually not valid for credit card rewards (with a fee). Visa usually has lower fee.,btohqsg
"So average of 60 days return could only be (5+3.8)/2~4.4 % (maximum)?Realised they don't use the word ""guaranteed"" anymore.",btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking more of a cheap way to buy miles actually.Any success stories of people converting from lady‚Äôs to solitaire without the 120k criteria?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt quote me but I think I saw on milelion that if you apply for UOB solitaire on SMS  got chance to approve even if don‚Äôt meet 120k,btohqsg
Is this the incremental of 500 per month as required by OCBC?,btohqsg
What's the key diff between these two,btohqsg
I was following milelion chat and there are dp of successful getting lady sol for people with 80-90k but it was like 1-2 months ago. UOB kept changing their system. But no harm to try applying.,btohqsg
UOB One Account  salary credit or 2 GIRO arrangements. Any minimum amount on the GIRO arrangements?,btohqsg
Hi  can I pair up ipaymy with Amex True Cashback to pay insurance premium to get cashback?,btohqsg
Have u calc if the cashback worth the fee? üòÜ,btohqsg
I think if first time using ipayall with referral shd be ok. Also new to AMEX True cashback @ 3%,btohqsg

I do not know why.Correspondent Bank remains JP Morgan Chase and I do NOT invest with JP Morgan.,btohqsg
Yeaa seems like not as worth it anymore,btohqsg

does anyone know if Trust card‚Äôs 5 x S$30 spends criteria apply for oversea transactions as well ? I‚Äôve made some oversea payments worth above $S30 but the progress didn‚Äôt move at all,btohqsg
Hi senpais  I just opened a cimb fast saver account online but I hv not received my cimb clicks account is that normal? I have already transferred the minimum 1000 dollars to the account,btohqsg

Hi all  want to ask  my UOB ladies card category is dining  and I got another UOB PRVI miles card  if I dining at overseas  actually which card should I use to maximise the miles collection?,btohqsg
