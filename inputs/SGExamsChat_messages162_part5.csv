I have a friend and former classmate who can tell you  a particular topic is found on which paragraph on which page of the textbook. Very clever. Graduated with first class honours in university.,btohqsg
No  O levels equivalent Biology textbook,btohqsg

Because my chem teacher is a bio nerd,btohqsg
And he same jc with desmond tan,btohqsg
Oh so h2 phy and h2 chem also can still go nus med ah,btohqsg
Thing is  I skipped a year overseas (entered primary school one year early) So I am actually almost one year younger than him.After JC I also dropped out of one university so I wasted a lot of time. Plus I had to wait almost six months to start JC as I finished my secondary 4 equivalent in the middle of the year. Then wait again for university,btohqsg
Oh ok. My bro in sec 2 now and he choosing subj tomorrow. He wanna enter NUS med .He say he can do both phy and bio. But his sch only offers double pure. So shld he take phy or bio. I personally took pure phy and i think is easier then bio as my friends tell me bio more content heavy. Which subj shld my brother take?,btohqsg

Pure sci half the thing fake,btohqsg
I was given the decision to serve or not to serve  subject to the board's approval. So even if I said I wanted to serve they can still reject and say exempted.,btohqsg
The bio knowledge in O level and A level will help him in med sch,btohqsg
