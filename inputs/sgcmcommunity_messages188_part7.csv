Wonder how’s the community take on Skoda. Looking to replace my VW. Would the maintenance be similar with VW in terms of pricing?,btohqsg
Just got octavia 3 mths back,btohqsg
You are sales man from  Skoda is it ?,btohqsg
Since Malaysia doesn’t have any maintenance centre for Skoda  I’m thinking if VAG shops can do it,btohqsg
High COE uh. I was looking at Combi,btohqsg
Side track a bit  is it correct to say if buy a 2nd hand car with higher coe  when selling later  can get back higher amt than compared with buying a lower coe car?,btohqsg
U buy a car w 20k COE  IF COE up  u can sell higher,btohqsg
If ur car COE so high U need sell high  but when coe bidding is low  ppl will buy meh? Wont get new better? Most ppl in this case will just scrap,btohqsg
Scrap and take back the balance coe,btohqsg

u see in 2028  will have alot of new cars coming out,btohqsg
cus all the 5 year warranty all end,btohqsg
we might have excess coe in the market then,btohqsg
they borrowed from the future liao.. thats why the current coe drops,btohqsg
So after that we're on our own lol unless of course the much needed coe changes materialise,btohqsg
So 5yrs lte COE shortage. Then boom again,btohqsg
So we will be alive to witness a $250k Honda Fit w bare minimum interior,btohqsg
i think now the main issue is they stop veh population growth,btohqsg
last time used to be 0.3% per annum,btohqsg
but now issue is if ur veh population stops growing  our human population is still on-going,btohqsg
resulting in undersupply of COE  and definitely overcrowding on public tpt,btohqsg
end result is LTA just wanna profit fully. that's why they dc buses overcrowded anot. they want it to be overcrowded,btohqsg
0% pop growth bad idea  it shud be a fixed % against our total population,btohqsg
Thts why every neighbour has 3-4 mrt stations,btohqsg
but u cant increase smth without increasing smth else,btohqsg
All leads to other parts of the island,btohqsg
e.g u want more revenue  u must increase taxes,btohqsg
Now amk go pasir ris no need go to towniao,btohqsg
our road infrastructure cannot grow at the same rate as our population  it is not physically possible,btohqsg
Ya mine bro car buy from that year ..2018.. new mazda 3 only 80k with COE,btohqsg
Lol why keep advertising here...in urgent need to sell?,btohqsg
