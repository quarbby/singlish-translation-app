My boss asked me why I didn't take leave that time,btohqsg
Yea so u hv the answer to the qns  before the interview,btohqsg
I tell him I don't even have leave at that time to even take that,btohqsg
Oh so sick leave and normal leave is counted tgt?,btohqsg
In Japan  if you sick and want to rest at home  then its normal leave liao,btohqsg
The good thing is that my company can WFH,btohqsg
So if I suffer from headache that day  I just find time to rest,btohqsg
Reminds me of Poly sometimes ngl,btohqsg
Depends on how many years you are in the company,btohqsg
Especially RP some days u just can't be sick,btohqsg
Iirc average here is 14 MC 14 AL (initially) 90 hospitalization,btohqsg
While you might think Japan has not a lot of leave compared to SG,btohqsg
Japan has way more public holidays than SG,btohqsg
Is it true the work-life balance there is q bad,btohqsg
Anything can also become public holidays de in Japan,btohqsg
I always get that questions asked,btohqsg
I feel SG worse than Japan,btohqsg
I think mc and hospitalisation leave is more or less standard,btohqsg
Ig u can just offset using that for minor stuff,btohqsg
If you mean PTO by no pay leave,btohqsg
But I feel that Singapore's working culture a bit like Japan,btohqsg
I think I remember watching a video on SG working culture,btohqsg
Where people don't dare to leave the office if their heads don't leave the office,btohqsg
When I see this... I was like hmm that seems like a Japan work culture,btohqsg
And i heard my mum complaining abt this person who leaves on the dot everyday,btohqsg
If their heads dun leave until 10pm…gg.com,btohqsg
See the existence of your mum's thinking is an example of such behavior happening in Singapores work culture,btohqsg
But most will leave around 5-6pm anyways tbh,btohqsg
That one by 6pm u can slip out liao,btohqsg
Idk can just pull up with new projects it seems?,btohqsg
If I were back in SG,btohqsg
Some ppl just dun like bringing work home,btohqsg
Honestly I would just leave on the dot,btohqsg
U can. Also depends on office some is still a closed office concept,btohqsg
I mean no one is stopping u if u get work done,btohqsg
Not like the boss can actually see you,btohqsg
Some people just spend quite a lot of time taking breaks,btohqsg
But for me i probably would not stay too late coz if i eat my meals too late  i will feel nauseous,btohqsg
Also 12pm-2pm office is a ghost town,btohqsg
Actually hor why such thing happens because people scared that there will be someone complaining,btohqsg
Scared of backstabbing so they smokescreen it,btohqsg
No is just if u dun complete your work is one more thing to say they very uptight or smth,btohqsg
I mean ofc need to ensure work is completed…,btohqsg
Then that one is either the company's not very good in their management skills,btohqsg
Or skills issue on your side,btohqsg
Tbh sometimes that's why I hate open office concepts,btohqsg
I do hv some corporate skill issue im in the process of trying to fix it,btohqsg
That is why im q scared of entering the corporate world,btohqsg
Well I mean if you keep on OT just because you can't finish your work on time,btohqsg
Then its either you have a lot of workload which is actually a management issue,btohqsg
