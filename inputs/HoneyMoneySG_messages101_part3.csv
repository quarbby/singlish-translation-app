I tried pay RMB to my hb Alipay AC  but cannot pay through foreign bank AC or cc. I believe maybe only those shop Marchant then we can pay using foreign cc? But at china  some payment will pay to their personal Alipay (like our paynow or paylah)  then we can't able to the payment?,btohqsg
did u reply to wrong message?ANYWAY  answering your question  I believe you are not able to pay to an individual alipay (non mainland chinese) using Credit Card (to prevent MS).You can only use your Credit Card linked to Alipay to pay a corporate Alipay or Mainland Chinese Alipay account.,btohqsg

Hi can I check typically how long does it take for ocbc 360 account to be approved? Want to apply for it due to its new promotion:https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/accounts/tncs-governing-ocbc-new-360-account-promo.pdf,btohqsg
Ok  I think so. But some small business stall owner using their personal Alipay AC  then we can't do the payment?,btohqsg
if in china it should be ok.Alipay just set that safety in place so you don't use your credit card to pay your husband and earn rewards,btohqsg

Doesn‚Äôt matter which one you accomplish first  but both spending and salary credit must be done to get the higher interest,btohqsg
no fee no CPF deduction no loss of interest,btohqsg
"I emailed them this""What I want to know is how is the policy‚Äôs cash value increasing every month? and at what rate? and also the fees that is being incurred by having this policy  for example ""income insurance taking 1% management fee"" All this was not documented in the original document and i would like to have more details on all of this thank you""Their reply :""We have triggered a copy of the latest illustration that will reflect the projected surrender/cash values under this policy. We wish to share that the surrender/cash value of insurance policy is different from bank account or fixed deposits. The surrender/cash value doesn‚Äôt grow linearly at a specific interest rate.The surrender/cash value is the present value of the policy based on factors applied to the policy‚Äôs sum assured and bonuses.""",btohqsg
