Hahaha reallyâ€¦. I need to pee more than pump electron into my EV,btohqsg
also  MG and Kona  which one is more efficient ah?,btohqsg
And during the drive  a lot of cars zoom past. Approaching KL  I see them zoom pass me again.,btohqsg
They need to pump one more time while driving fast,btohqsg
Kona. But Kona is quite small,btohqsg
because smaller and lighter or is the motor just more efficient,btohqsg
Motor more efficient and smaller size than mg,btohqsg
