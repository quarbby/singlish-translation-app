Anyone knows if chatgpt subscription is considered eligible spend under ocbc365 cc?,btohqsg
Which cc? Or you meant ocbc 365?,btohqsg
Don't think ocbc 365 gives cashback for chatgpt sub,btohqsg
I interested to know. But not interested to sign up to Xthread. Care to share the opinions here?,btohqsg
I reviewed your X thread. I didnt see anything wrong with Revolut. They could be clearer with their instructions. You kept everything in ur normal account so the transfer back to dbs account is per regulatory requirement.,btohqsg
In summary  revolut has normal and flexible accounts. Flexible account has some promo interest for USD amount. Bank transfer will go to normal acct. Normal acct cannot hold more than 20k sgd so remember transferring to flexible acct right away.DISCLAIMER: This is not endorsement for Revolut.,btohqsg
All SifuWant to ask if I cancel SQ flight ticket while purchase through miles redeemedIs it miles will credit back to account? Or burn?,btohqsg

I want book from 15 - 22 May and it is available not waitlistWhen I select two person to book suddenly become waitlistThinking if can open 2 browser book single person at the same time,btohqsg
Confirm user problem. No check and confirm before taking action.Moral of story  always check and confirm before doing anything.,btohqsg
Burn if refund date is after miles expiry.,btohqsg
Still have 2 yearsSo should be able to credit all back right?,btohqsg
Then should be fine. I'm assuming KF miles?,btohqsg

Need to use these few days.  Actually have been waiting to receive the card since last week.  Or don't need physical card?  But thought need to receive and activate,btohqsg
"Is cpf interest ""compounded"" this word ""compounded"" monthly w new total or 3 monthly?",btohqsg
Google answer is interest computed not compounded.,btohqsg
TLDR: very lugi method.CPF interest is calculated monthly based on the LOWEST balance of the month.CPF interest is only credited once a year.Thus  there is NO monthly compounding.Thus  there is only ANNUAL compounding of the interest credited.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/how-is-my-cpf-interest-computed-and-credited-into-my-accounts,btohqsg
Computed monthly based on lowest balance.Compounded annually,btohqsg
So 1k monthly into SA  4% is 12 months x 1k is 480. Then new total following yr is 12480 +(12k) *1.04% will get new capital 25 459.20 correct?,btohqsg
err no..better use excelJan = $0 (lowest balance)Feb = $1000etc...Dec = $11000each cell you x 0.04 / 12Total interest for the year is the total of the 12 cells.Sure will have some rounding errors.,btohqsg
Any tips for SQ waitlist?High peak to JapanOr just ignore pick confirm list?,btohqsg
high peak wait list is very hard to clear unless you PPS,btohqsg
Is it waitlist suddenly will become available? Or once waitlist will forever waitlist until departure date?,btohqsg
for high peak  waitlist will be very unlikely to clear,btohqsg
waitlist usually needs the confirmed holder(s) to cancel their ticketit is unlikely (not impossible) for airline to release additional seats.,btohqsg
you gotta redeem way in advance for JP during peak.,btohqsg
is there a way to check if the spending you're making is actually qualifying spend for a sign up bonus?,btohqsg
check the merchant category for each transaction using dbs digibot and check if the merchsnt category/merchant is excluded in the sign up promo TnC.,btohqsg
How long you need to hold this ? 3 months or less ?,btohqsg
Hi  for OCBC 360 any unit trust to intro to fulfil the INVEST bonus?,btohqsg
Are you ready to put 20k in for that?,btohqsg
Hi  idk if this is a stupid question but - I can use my Amaze card (linked with citi rewards) using Applypay overseas right? It works the same?,btohqsg
yes can.. but danger is if the merchant overseas accepts ApplePayalways safer to bring the Physical card overseas.,btohqsg
Ya overseas not all places accept applepay,btohqsg
it was very painful in Japan when i ran out of relevant card limits and had to fall back on my second UOB Visa Signature which I only had in my apple pay..end up i had to rely on Maybank Horizon Visa Signature (2.8mpd) which I brought as my ultimate backup (lousier than UOB VS 4mpd),btohqsg
What was your card ranking ?,btohqsg

Why can‚Äôt use VS+Apple Pay to pay oversea to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
my 2nd UOB VS is in applepay form only (didn't bring physical card) and many shops didn't accept applepay,btohqsg
Mean they don‚Äôt accept paywave n needs to magnetic swipe card?,btohqsg
In Japan  Paywave and Applepay are 2 different things.Even if can Paywave  if you use your Iphone to Paywave  it will fail,btohqsg
I thought Apple Pay and paywave is same thing. They are using same terminal ü§î,btohqsg
In Singapore  yes.Apparently in Japan  not all Paywave terminals can read ApplePay phones/technology... someone explained in Japan chat that the payment 'language' is slightly different.,btohqsg
Now that UOB doesnt earn points when linked with amaze  what other mastercard do you use for general spending when overseas  excluding Citibank rewards?,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how UOB cc payment works? My prev statement is 2sept I have paid off all minimum due but have about 1k+ still owed  will my next due date be 2oct? And if I spend more now  will it be due 2oct statement or 2nov statement?,btohqsg
Minimum 7 days to hold.There was 6% fund coupon for August for those who buy bonds but I don't see any coupon to redeem now  promotion must be ended.,btohqsg
why are u paying the minimum due? u wanna rack up interest?,btohqsg
Oh doesn‚Äôt it only charge interest if I miss the due date?,btohqsg
