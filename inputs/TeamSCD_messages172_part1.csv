What does everyone think about Mazda bringing back rotaries,btohqsg
It's not gonna be an engine right,btohqsg
I'd rather have an engine powering the drivetrain,btohqsg
rather than engine powering the charger,btohqsg
But drivetrain powered by electric battery and motors,btohqsg
so it's essentially still an EV,btohqsg
with a backup generator running around,btohqsg
it equates to no vroom vroom,btohqsg
maybe you mod the engine to bridge port,btohqsg
when it turns on to charge battery it'll idle with brap brap,btohqsg
but even when you full throttle at 100kmh it's still idling RPM brap brap,btohqsg
But the revs not in your control,btohqsg
