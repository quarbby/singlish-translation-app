What exists is a natural bell curve  not an artificial forced bell curve.When the difficulty of the paper is very low  you will not see the bell curve because everyone will be on the upper tier.A natural bell curve of grades can be artificially created by increasing the difficulty of the paper. When the paper is harder  it is natural that only a few will do extreeeemely well  extremely poorly  and most people will be in between.,btohqsg
did someone just say no bell curve for As???,btohqsg
U will know the true power of bell curve in uni,btohqsg
Isn't regulating the number of A grades just another form of bell curve?,btohqsg

Also  not if the number of A grades fluctuate  and vary widely from subject to subject also.,btohqsg
