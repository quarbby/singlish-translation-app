"SINGAPORE - In a move that set the motor industry talking  Customs officers raided Singapore's biggest vehicle complex on Sept 2.Singapore Customs said it had inspected a licensed warehouse facility at 60 Jalan Lam Huat in the Sungei Kadut area - the address of Carros Centre  a 2.3 million sq ft multi-storey complex housing several car importers and used car dealerships.""Investigations are ongoing "" said a Singapore Customs spokesman. It is not the practice of the authority - or any authority dealing in criminal or commercial investigations - to furnish details.The motor industry has  in the past few decades  been taken to task repeatedly for underdeclaring the value of cars imported to Singapore  and therefore underpaying taxes due.Several parties - from authorised agents to parallel importers - have been convicted  fined or jailed for these tax evasion offences  which amounted to several hundreds of millions in unpaid taxes.Photos of an area within the facility cordoned off by Singapore Customs were circulating on messaging services on the afternoon of Sept 13.In response to queries from The Straits Times  Singapore Customs confirmed that the photos show the premises of the licensed warehouse when it was under inspection.They include one showing barricades blocking access to an area marked under a signage that says ""Cars and Coffee"".Cars and Coffee Singapore is a major parallel importer of high-end cars  with a showroom on the sixth floor of Carros Centre. Its sole shareholder is Mr Chen Xiaoxuan  a Singapore citizen.When ST called its showroom on Sept 13  Cars and Coffee denied knowledge of the circulated photos and said it was continuing to conduct ""business as usual"".There were also no signs of the cordons at the premises when ST visited that evening.On Sept 14  the company announced on its Facebook page that there was a ""false news story circulating""  and that it was taking ""legal action against individuals who are spreading the false statements"".Licensed warehouses store dutiable goods such as alcohol  tobacco  motor vehicles and fuels for an indefinite period. However  duties must be paid before the goods can leave the warehouse.One dealer  who has been in the trade for more than 20 years  said he was not surprised by the raid  given that operations from Singapore Customs do happen from time to time.Such raids are probably to make sure that importers are ""not trying anything funny""  he added.Car importers that underdeclare the value of imported cars can price their cars lower than their competitors and still maintain their profit margin.In 2009  a prominent parallel importer was handed a record fine of $10.8 million for evading duty and taxes on more than 2 500 cars. Mr Tay Kien Chuan  then 33  who owned 8th Gear  could not pay the fine and was jailed for 8Â½ years instead.",btohqsg
