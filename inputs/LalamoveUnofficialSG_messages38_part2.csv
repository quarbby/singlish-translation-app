i dont think this is real news. for starters... no dates mentioned. also unable to verify with any other legit news source.,btohqsg
Agree...no location also for the rd blocksAnd generally doesnt sound like the way sg police do things,btohqsg
You call cs  they will sound very on the ball and have some pro way of locating customer2 weeks later they call u back to tell u customer uncontactable (as if u dunno  uncontactable thats why call cs for help wat) and all they did was call repeatedly with the same number you had  when its alrdy obvious the scammer doesnt intend to be contacted with that numberThen cs will tell u make police reportWhich will be a waste of time cos it only involves $20  and unless many riders kena like loanshark prank the police got better things to do üôÑ,btohqsg
So  the best solution is go temple get flowers and take flower bath,btohqsg
