Sorry if this seemed like a noob qn but does collecting UOB UNI$ for miles seemed better than citi points since it converts 5k : 10k miles while citi is 25k : 10k . ?,btohqsg
the question is rather how much money does it take to get these? that would make this comparison make sense,btohqsg
Can i say it’s how the 4mpd is being translated into their points that makes it look like UOB is much achievable than Citi points?,btohqsg
what do you mean by achievable? Both earn 4mpd if you use them the right way. End results for both sides are very similar.,btohqsg
Maybe im just enticed by the small number,btohqsg
