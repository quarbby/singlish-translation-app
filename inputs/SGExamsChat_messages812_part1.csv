England Fans : It Is Coming Home,btohqsg
Lol I went there to vote before,btohqsg
Vote for both president and the general election,btohqsg
And they are asking me to go there again this year,btohqsg
So looks like time for the chicken rice after voting,btohqsg
Looks like indeed ge will be this yr,btohqsg
What makes you think the GE might be this year,btohqsg
They still haven't do the boundaries committee yet,btohqsg
Around two months ago they sent me an email about some about overseas electorate,btohqsg
It is called knowing the signs,btohqsg
7 hours later they send another email saying sorry,btohqsg
We have sent the wrong email,btohqsg
I wouldnt risk anth by saying my opinions here but yaa for me to know and for u to find outðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Actually I don't really know lol if its this year and when,btohqsg
if this year will be in last two months,btohqsg
But I just want to go and have chicken rice that's it,btohqsg
Lol but it gives me the accidental leak vibes,btohqsg
Prolly sch holidays coz they need the schs for the elections,btohqsg
Dk I just wan them to update the voter rolls again if that is the case,btohqsg
Quite near to the Tokyo towers and Ginza,btohqsg
For overseas voters if u are far away fr the embassy  too bad right,btohqsg
Because voting can only be done at the embassy,btohqsg
Either way overseas votes don't really count a lot as well,btohqsg
That's why they sent the email 2 months ago,btohqsg
It was for the voter rolls,btohqsg
They only count the overseas votes when it is a very close fight,btohqsg
U turn 21 by July of this year meh?,btohqsg
If u part of it most likely no change,btohqsg
Oh u mean turn 21 on yr of election ah,btohqsg
Means can receive chicken wing liao,btohqsg
And watch them take back the whole chicken while they are at it,btohqsg
Im not sure how it works for GE,btohqsg
But GE there are constituencies w v tight contest,btohqsg
So prolly it can go up to 5am because they count overseas votes (?),btohqsg
Wait isnt this a sign that election is this yr,btohqsg
Since their cut off is 1 June 2024,btohqsg
No because they need the boundaries committee,btohqsg
If it is in 2025  they will send this next yr what,btohqsg
Most likely should be this year bah,btohqsg
When I'm not so sure as well,btohqsg
I just want an excuse to eat chicken rice that's all,btohqsg
Not going to travel all the way to azabu juban,btohqsg
And if election is next yr  they will only send that email next yr,btohqsg
They do. Because Parliamentary Replies compell them to do so.,btohqsg
W a next yr cut off,btohqsg
Anyways they only do such things 1-2m before the elections,btohqsg
After the committee has been made,btohqsg
