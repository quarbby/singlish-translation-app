Hello does anyone have a transfer board to borrow/for sale?,btohqsg
There are some selling on Carousell!But please do ask your doctor for advice before you proceed. Our doctor shared that a transfer board was only suitable if we had at least two people to do the patient transfer  and you have to be very careful or you risk accidents happening during the transfer process if you use it incorrectly.Because there is only one person looking after my mum  the physiotherapist taught me how to safely transfer her from bed to wheelchair  and from wheelchair to taxi  without a transfer board‚Äî just with my arms and body  and the right positions and postures. I also practiced with the physiotherapist helping my mum go into and out of the taxi at the Sengkang hospital car park.,btohqsg
Collection @ Hougang Ave 1Anyone find this useful? Please DM me. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know of good nursing home in Serangoon  Yishun area. Friend's mum 90 recently got stroke  currently stayed at TTSH-ICH. Thereafter need to transfer to Nursing Home or Home. But nowadays difficult to look for domestic helper  so alterative look for nursing home to stay.,btohqsg
"Hi@numberonedoraemonfan  finding a suitable nursing home for your friend's mum can be challenging. While determining whether a nursing home is ""good"" or not can be subjective (usually we have mixed reviews for all nursing homes from the conversations we hear from fellow caregivers) and may depend on individual needs and preferences  I suggest referring to the HealthHub Nursing Home Directory for a comprehensive list of options:https://eservices.healthhub.sg/healthhubng/public/services/directory/65.Some nursing homes in or near the Serangoon and Yishun areas include:- Bright Hill Evergreen Home (Serangoon area)- Peacehaven Nursing Home (near Upper Serangoon)- All Saints Home (Yishun)- Ren Ci @ Ang Mo Kio (close to Yishun)- St. Andrew‚Äôs Nursing Home (Buangkok)It‚Äôs best to explore these options based on your friend‚Äôs mum's specific care needs  such as post-stroke rehabilitation  long-term care  or dementia support. I recommend contacting the nursing homes directly to learn about their services  facilities  and availability  and  if possible  arranging a site visit to assess if it meets her requirements.",btohqsg

Hello all  seeking some advice about seeking financial assistance for bedridden 68 yo father.Due to being main caregiver at home for him  i have taken up lesser income & 2 other siblings income not stable lately.But refused to provide income statement / CPF document.Should I contact legal help?- Father is no longer mentally competent so yes I have court letter to represent my father he requires diapers medical supplies and milk feeding  physiotherapy,btohqsg
Hi@hellocosybakessorry to hear about your challenges  it‚Äôs not uncommon for some families that had the same challenges you had.Since you already have aCourt Orderto represent your father  you have the legal authority to act in his best interests. However  if your siblings‚Äô refusal to provide their income documents is hindering your ability to apply for subsidies  consider the following:Mediation Services:‚Ä¢ TheCommunity Mediation Centre (CMC)can help facilitate discussions between you and your siblings to address the matter amicably.Legal Assistance:‚Ä¢ If mediation does not work  you may seek legal advice to explore options to enforce financial contribution from siblings under theMaintenance of Parents Act. You can contact theLegal Aid Bureaufor affordable legal help or reach out to theFamily Justice Courts.Check with AIC or your designated social worker to see if they can provide you further advices Joe to go about it. Take care.,btohqsg
Oh I see thank you so much for your advice and tips. I will seek help accordingly. Very helpful to know about maintenance of parents act I did not realise that,btohqsg

Most welcome! Hope is helpful for u!,btohqsg
Hi  where to find those freelance/part time caregivers that we can engage directly?Thanks!,btohqsg
These providers are able to provide as well,btohqsg
I checked a few and it‚Äôs pre schedule based on hourly rate.,btohqsg
yes it's mostly in such model. Are you implying that you want to find caregivers that can be activated to come anytime you prefer and not charged by hourly?,btohqsg
Yes. Cos my father condition is unpredictable.,btohqsg
i see. i hear you  but unfortunately there isn't such service that are made available at this moment. Long time ago there were companies that attempted it but it wasn't sustainable and the cost became too high (due to the company still have to pay for their staff on standby with or without customer) for most caregivers to be willing to pay for it.We are aware that most people either went for full time domestic helper as an option  or made arrangement within their household members to take turn on standby for unforseen circumstances. Alternatively  some ended up choosing nursing home as the way out due to financial constraint or interpersonal issues with domestic helpers.,btohqsg
Thanks.. we have a helper but it is exhausting sometimes.,btohqsg
another alternative is u can ask the hospital medical social worker to help refer u to ICS ( interim caregiver) .. I did that previously for mine,btohqsg
I understand.. you may consider to engage hourly rated caregivers on periodic basis to give your family and domestic helper a structured resting period every 1-2 weeks  depending on your financial capability to determine how regular you can afford to. This might provide you and your family members a more sustainable approach in resource and capacity planning for your own wellbeing.,btohqsg
I contacted Homage.. using the apps to book their service  maybe takes 1 to 2 hrs for response if I have urgent requests.,btohqsg
For jaga me  need to give many days notice.,btohqsg
Pre-loved items to bless forward by a caregiver.If you find this useful  do PM me to get in touch with the caregiver.,btohqsg
"Hi  I'm wondering if anyone can offer me some advice or tips on how to safely care for my father who has vascular dementia and a tendency to ""escape"" from the hospital bed.",btohqsg
He is in SKCH now and will be discharged to my care  however I have an 8yo with SN as well to care for  and not enough space for a live in caregiver (apart from myself).I am hoping his mood will improve under my care  however I understand with vascular dementia this can be quite unpredictable?,btohqsg
Have you considered approaching dementia SG? they have a caregiver support program and can provide some help/tips on caring for your loved one with dementia,btohqsg
Updates. The bed and geriatric chair are reserved please.,btohqsg
I used a tracking device watch sending a msg everytime my grandma does this,btohqsg
There is an anti-wandering mat that when he/she steps off the bed onto the mat  there will be a visual and sound alert to an alarm place in caregiver room or living room etc.Maybe something u can consider too,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone have nasal oxygen cannula to donate/give away?I am working in the community hospital and one of my clients needs it.Need to be in good condition  and in a packet.,btohqsg
Icic. Thank you. I will look into it,btohqsg
Ah...I hope my dad will keep it on,btohqsg
Thank you  I did contact them and they called me back just  however at this point they think I should also look into asking SKCH to keep him warded until I can ready my place since I'm not ready yet,btohqsg
Are you able to attach an Apple AirTag to the belt loop of his pants / shorts?,btohqsg
be firm that you will need help until you managed to get the right setup to support your dad  let them know that safety and wellbeing is at risk so that they can offer advices and resources to you better.,btohqsg
im making use of OMG solutions watch for my grandma back then... Fall detector allowed and u can video call them just need to click on green button to ans .. very easy to use..Mine likes to remove too. the min she remove we got alerted.. was using it till she got a helper,btohqsg
it was okay .. not very price too.. I think i paid less than $200 for it .. just need get sim card,btohqsg
even if he runs out the gps u can trace and find where he mia too,btohqsg
https://shop.tackgps.app/For the tracking one  can consider this one  that can go anywhere. Their price is low and their accuracy is very good.,btohqsg
Haiz. I talk to MSW about my situation and eventually still bounce me to AIC. Call up AIC they also said that it's the financial grants they can help me with  but I have to persuade the Dr and PT....talk to Dr and PT both assure me dad's stable ....even after knowing he pushed me and refused my help to walk alongside him  not even going into personal care yet (nurse can't even sign off on teaching me how to change his diaper cos he rejected me),btohqsg
