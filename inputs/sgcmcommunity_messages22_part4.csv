This is the trend from what I see as a bystander:60/70s European cars: Simplicity  easy to maintain. Break easily but easy fix. On the other side: MURICA MUST HAVE V8s!!!80s Germans especially Mercedes Benz/BMW: COMPETITION  let over engineer and outdo competitor brand (M3  190E rivalry yay)90s Germans: Now we know what we are doing  we gotta stop overengineering and think of planned obsolescence or else people keep sticking to their old cars.Meanwhile 90s Japan: WATASHI WA OVER-ENGINEERING DESULate 90s~late 2000s: Global Economic crash  japan lost years in economy. Japan chilled and their turn for planned obsolescence.From 2010s: Kimchi is getting nicer and stronger.,btohqsg
can start or cannot start.  two schools of thought. all things mechanical will fail and the automotive is a complex system. Some owners are happy as long as the car can start and moves.  Some like to know early where certain parts of the system are starting to go off  before they potentially start a daisy chain of causing larger damage and required repairs.,btohqsg
end of the day  go for a car which suits your personality  and budget to achieve the greatest happiness,btohqsg
ya any car regardless it's cheap or exp. most important must suit u n yr lifestyle,btohqsg
there will always be owners who want more information from the car  and those who don't need to be flooded by all these information.,btohqsg
i know owners who even buy OBD and software and routinely scan the car themselves at home for even minor codes which the car doesn't feel is serious enough to throw an alarm light!,btohqsg
what hearsay are you talking about? i mentioend this based on my experience of owning BMWs and jaopanese cars vios and mazda. are you lost somewhere?,btohqsg
mazda is full of sensors. too many too. but they dont breakdown,btohqsg
