My wife is holding on to LTVP. But i have 2 kids. I applied for 4room to,btohqsg
How long do your wife hold ltvp,btohqsg
Yup. Waiting for it to be ready next year,btohqsg
I applied for bto on 2018,btohqsg
Does anyone here rent a house under PPHS?,btohqsg
got kids as citizen different liao since its quite a sure way to convert to citizen from LTVP,btohqsg
Ooo cause i want to apply,btohqsg
can anyone guess where is this,btohqsg
living room has a small balcony but it's an unique layout,btohqsg
4r at $400+k  low floor like 3rd/4th,btohqsg
Im not sure but ive been keeping up w their vlogs for some time  theyve been doing reno for soooo long!,btohqsg
so secretive  anyway someone commented its at amk,btohqsg
since they want to remain secretive  then let the mystery of their BTO project remains,btohqsg
low floor can't expose since easy to guess  but for high floor  can only guess the range nia,btohqsg
those ballot for fun probably are depriving other genuine applicants from getting a chance  benefiting HDB nia,btohqsg
my colleague ballot for tampines of Aug 2020 which it has 3 projects  and he got 200+ which is considered low but he balloted for fun to see how his luck fares,btohqsg
my other colleague got 700+ but never attended the selection and ended up getting resale,btohqsg
she never ballot for fun  but she failed to apply leave for that day,btohqsg
as if luck is constant...... hahahaha,btohqsg
because he already has a house and tampines not enough to attract him,btohqsg
cmon man  other ppl have no home yet,btohqsg
what housing stage are you at now?,btohqsg
this launch is my first time balloting,btohqsg
i have a friend whos failed 4 times so far  haha,btohqsg
i have a cousin getting married but havent secured a BTO unit  haha,btohqsg
I was married like a week after I applied BTO,btohqsg
not sure am I considered lucky to get numbers within supplies using scheme,btohqsg
i have friends who failed 7 times. and went for resale. got tired of paying $10,btohqsg
i had my 1st ballot for Aug 2020 project  and thankfully had a good number,btohqsg
4th try to get a ballot number for me. I got mine thru sobf exercise.,btohqsg
I heard of cases where people balloted for fun and then drop their applications... Really detrimental to those who are in urgent need of a new home and also to themselves..My understanding is  you only have 2 chances where you are considered a first timer.Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Last day for the bto exercise  guys. Good luck to those who have applied. To those who are keen but yet to submit  u have till the end of the day.,btohqsg
some people already have roofs over them but don't mind spending $20 a year to see how far their luck can go,btohqsg
actually I also no different from them since I ballot for 2 times and skipped the appointments but I was a genuine applicant who only keen in a water facing high storey unit,btohqsg
I dropped once too  but simply because the remaining available units not suitable for me. When I got my ballot number for my current unit  I guess I'm blessed.,btohqsg
but did you call to cancel your appointment?,btohqsg
never  the staff called me up instead on the day of selection,btohqsg
Yes. Very. Pricing wise also a bit inflated.,btohqsg
3r of TB is so underwhelmed compared to its 4r counterpart,btohqsg
in fact 2nd lowest besides MW,btohqsg
For me  I went down on the day to inform them that I won't be picking a unit. But I got tell them my reason. They informed me that regardless of reason  my 1 out of 2 first timer chances will be gone. I acknowledged  cos I rather burn one chance than to end up with a unit which is not suitable... I.e. bigger problem.,btohqsg
The shrewd decision is to apply for 3R this time.,btohqsg
oh  I never attended probably because I have gotten a double digit on my 3rd ballot,btohqsg
that's unless if one does not mind the size,btohqsg
if anyone is aiming for a Seaview HDB BTO  then just wait lor  should be coming within the next decade,btohqsg
but please note on the potential issue of sea rising level in Singapore,btohqsg
say the DPD of the launch now is as early as 4 years later should the pandemic gets better  with the progress of construction gets normal  plus MOP  9 years of wait before you can ballot for new BTO as a 2nd timer  that's if cooling measure remains the same,btohqsg
Oh. I didn't consider this before. Mainly because I've been looking at areas in the central.,btohqsg
DPD: delivery possession date  which HDB has to hand the keys over to the home owners,btohqsg
might as well don't go since already one chance used up,btohqsg
