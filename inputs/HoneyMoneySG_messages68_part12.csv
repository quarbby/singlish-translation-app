Hi everyone   I have some questions about CPF ERS...At 55  CPF will take out your SA first right? Will they only take out the FRS or up to the ERS? Do I get a choice?,btohqsg
from what i read its up to FRS   to go above FRS   you would need to manually TOP up for it to become ERS,btohqsg
Thanks WZ.Is there any point in topping up beyond FRS? What if I prefer low risk and just want to put as much as I can into RA and let it compound for me.,btohqsg
Manually top up = transfer from SA to RA right?,btohqsg
FRS and ERS difference is the payout at age 65 ownwards,btohqsg
