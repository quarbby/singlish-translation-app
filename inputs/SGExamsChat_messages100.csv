You know what is damn cute?,btohqsg
Starting more than $5k is like,btohqsg
Time to jump off the bandwagon,btohqsg
wait I thought they removed CSC,btohqsg
for saying being cs students make them the elites of society,btohqsg
Probably becaue Ben Leong is the only one that reads nus confessions,btohqsg
And the most fun to troll,btohqsg
U want to fight with ah tiongs?,btohqsg
Lol in the comments of that confession prof ben practically said he trolled too,btohqsg
CSC - Computer Science in Chinese,btohqsg
oh god bedok is jumping on the wagon,btohqsg
Engineering was no longer popular since 2010s,btohqsg
I want to know why ah,btohqsg
All mathematicians will be paid 10k a month in the future,btohqsg
PM Lee keeps saying they need more engineers,btohqsg
All mathematics being paid >10k a month ==> Riemann Hypothesis is proven,btohqsg
Got some other CS profs read also but they rarely comment,btohqsg
I topped the class for first order logic,btohqsg
Does he even remember his math,btohqsg
Apparently he codes stuff in his free time,btohqsg
I mean those hardcore math theory,btohqsg
Why aren't math profs cool enough to comment,btohqsg
Why did he even choose to do maths anyway,btohqsg
He was pretty much 99.999% confirmed to be a government official,btohqsg
He already has a career path planned out for him,btohqsg
Why need to think about the practicality of the degree,btohqsg
His prof wanted him to do phd,btohqsg
Sure but you’d think he would pick the classic politician degree,btohqsg
Do math profs look like they surf nuswhispers,btohqsg
If you have like a lot of experience in coding  making projects  etc,btohqsg
You can get hired without the need of a cs degree,btohqsg
If I meet LHL in real life  that’s what I’m going to ask him,btohqsg
I mean which course is the next bandwagon lol,btohqsg
Will the honour be meeting LHL in real life or meeting John Smith in real life,btohqsg
Imagine if LHL was a math prof,btohqsg
Or whatever skillset is required to do shit to the brain,btohqsg
Too hardcore man. Many will drop out,btohqsg
Didn't end well for bio graduates tho,btohqsg
Before chem engine was life science,btohqsg
It's time for maths to have it's moment,btohqsg
Before dot com bust  it was comp sci,btohqsg
Once we can upload our brains,btohqsg
I think math will be pretty good,btohqsg
As the next and final bandwagon course,btohqsg
Don't think business will ever have bangwagon lol,btohqsg
Unless it's rise of entrepreneurship or something,btohqsg
Few jobs require biz degree anyway,btohqsg
Stem majors can even do biz degree jobs,btohqsg
Wah that one suited for math degree lol,btohqsg
It is under math dept anyway,btohqsg
Q hard to get in though,btohqsg
Tbh I have no idea what a lot of majors learn lol,btohqsg
You know ur comp sci can liao,btohqsg
Biz probably teach you how to manage a business but not the process of starting one lol,btohqsg
You want learn entrepreneurship can join noc lorh,btohqsg
So multi variable calculus and stuff I Guess,btohqsg
Something chim sounding like stochastic calculus,btohqsg
Just self study a little before hand and then go in,btohqsg
Hopefully get a good grade so it actually counts towards the CAP,btohqsg
I think only my H3 will be APC,btohqsg
I don't really have access to the module papers anyway  for practice,btohqsg
You’re not doing physics in Uni,btohqsg
Would it matter that you took H3 physics,btohqsg
FoS has a faculty requirement to complete some mods,btohqsg
Basically 6 different groups of mods  choose 4,btohqsg
Cs have 1 sci mod requirement also eh,btohqsg
CS  Chem  Life science  physics  math  multidisciplinary,btohqsg
Actually that one I not very sure,btohqsg
Cause according to the website if take ddp,btohqsg
If u take ddp it is auto counted,btohqsg
Just take any of ur 2k math mod as sci requirement lorh,btohqsg
Students pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics/Applied Mathematics or Second Major in Mathematics/Statistics will take ST2131 Probability and ST2132 Mathematical Statistics in place of ST2334 Probability and Statistics. Students pursuing a Second Major in Statistics will take ST2131 in place of ST2334.,btohqsg
2334 got v steep bell curve,btohqsg
So ST2334 (4 MCs) becomes ST2131 and ST2132 (8 MCs total),btohqsg
I'm not sure where the additional 4 MCs will go to,btohqsg
2334 is a pretty crap mod also,btohqsg
I assume its the one science module lol,btohqsg
Ur st2131 is used to replace 2334,btohqsg
Ur 2132 is counted as a sci requirement,btohqsg
yeah so no need to double count the h3 physics,btohqsg
U should do 2104 before doing 2131,btohqsg
The moe one is on modern phy,btohqsg
2131 uses alot of double integrals which is taught in 2104,btohqsg
sia la i guess also get correct,btohqsg
Line and surface is triple integral liao,btohqsg
my head still cant wrap around multivar,btohqsg
then all the transformation. line to surface  surface to volume,btohqsg
I did NUS PC1144 for my H3,btohqsg
It's an introduction to modern physics,btohqsg
Special relativity  quantum physics and mechanics and nuclear physics,btohqsg
Is there still h3 linear algebra now,btohqsg
to learn quantum need learn linear is it,btohqsg
i tot all the computation is in matrix form,btohqsg
The one that need linear algebra is quantum computing,btohqsg
There was a bit of matrices in special relativity,btohqsg
i need fing some time relearn linear al and multivar,btohqsg
Mvc is ok until they started on line and surface integrals,btohqsg
mine started from line and surface,btohqsg
thats why from the start i mind blown le,btohqsg
ok forget it im not a engineering dude anymore,btohqsg
Yet BIE grads were mostly jobless,btohqsg
U can say the same for life science too,btohqsg
I think last time got a short bangwagon for accountancy degree too,btohqsg
is this the same dude as the nus confession page,btohqsg
He wrote this to debate against the ntu prof view,btohqsg
dun scare mr milo he's going to study accountancy,btohqsg
If i start caring about people i wont be able to say anyth,btohqsg
scallywag indeed the way i know u,btohqsg
anyone familiar with how UK A level works? Because I just want to ask whether As level is the same as H1 in SG,btohqsg
if u are taking it for admission to local unis  u prob need to score A*/Asfor all/almost all subjects on ur cert,btohqsg
They are usually easier than sg a level,btohqsg
because the uni im looking into now says they do not accept any AS subjects  and im wondering if that's the same level as h1,btohqsg
google searches have not been proven useful,btohqsg
Eh I heard my friends say must take all the A2s,btohqsg
oh if i'm not mistaken UK unis don't rly look at h1 subjects! so they'll take ur h2 grades only,btohqsg
np and all the best :^,btohqsg
I think they call it AO subjects for H1,btohqsg
oh nvm they call it AS subjects,btohqsg
Ah where does AS fit in all this HAHAH,btohqsg
There are like 5 different exam providers in UK?,btohqsg
I think each have a slightly different system,btohqsg
Alright so much for looking into UK unis HAHHAA,btohqsg
Sg uni also tough  overseas uni also tough omg imma just sign up hdb and sweep roads,btohqsg
rhetorically with a decent amount of effort  what’s the probability of scoring a 6 for O’s ?,btohqsg
No idea how much is decent,btohqsg
Decent amount of effort can give you 7 or 8,btohqsg
My brain cant process the use of the word rhetoric there,btohqsg
The probability depends on more things than effort,btohqsg
to what extent does one have to work to achieve a 6,btohqsg
Ya I also can’t understand why use the word rhetorical,btohqsg
tbh don't think too much bah,btohqsg
If I tell you high chance/low chance,btohqsg
To get 6 points  the main issue that you will face is scoring an A1 for english,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s based purely on effort alone,btohqsg
That also depends on the person,btohqsg
Also depends on luck and ur cohort?,btohqsg
To add on  hardwork does not guarentee you success,btohqsg
Anyway what do you need 6 points for,btohqsg
Same reason why one would want a million dollars I suppose,btohqsg
If you work hard but careless on the day of exam  your efforts will be in vain,btohqsg
Good ability  exam taking skills   effort  or a dumb cohort,btohqsg
Dumb cohort is nearly impossible  there is St nick  catholic high  nan chiau and other powerhouse.To add on  grade boundary is not dependant on others performance,btohqsg
honestly i’m not concerned with the probability of all factors you guys have considered because it’s purely based on luck. rather  i’d like to see what extent i’d have to go with what i CAN control.,btohqsg
I’d say work as hard as u can,btohqsg
U can’t work more hard than u can right,btohqsg
But it's just my personal opinion that 6 points isn't necessary,btohqsg
i get that i am to work hard  but what is ‘hard enough’ ?,btohqsg
I can only read first para,btohqsg
Enough is subjective  that is for you to find out.,btohqsg
If you’re asking for specific numbers like how long to study or stuff like that  we can’t really answer you because it’s up to you,btohqsg
Eh so if u know what’s enough and u can’t reach that intensity,btohqsg
We really not trying to avoid the question,btohqsg
It's that the question isn't really possible to be answered,btohqsg
I once spent 10 months on the sat,btohqsg
I did papers that end up taller than me,btohqsg
Not impossible per se but it is really subjective,btohqsg
10 hrs a day looks like enough,btohqsg
Study and understand every concept to be tested,btohqsg
I screwed up and got 2240,btohqsg
Really  just study as hard as you can  make sure you understand the concepts  but don't overwork till you burn out,btohqsg
After that I did zero papers more and tried sat again,btohqsg
But saying all this stuff is pretty abstract,btohqsg
Its out of 1.6k uh no ?,btohqsg
I don’t think effort plays a huge role in my first and second test,btohqsg
Both times critical reading got 800 tho,btohqsg
So it’s luck cos writing is screwed up,btohqsg
A lot of idiomatic usage to memories,btohqsg
But the way u type reminds me of another user in this group,btohqsg
I thought AO is old policy,btohqsg
I thought now is AS and A2,btohqsg
Eh eh but what's AS then,btohqsg
Anyways  hardwork is not really much needed to do well for o level.I fooled around  slept during class and not do practice papers but scored raw 7.,btohqsg
Yeah that just indicates that hard work need pair with talent,btohqsg
i can’t exactly afford to slack that much :),btohqsg
If it’s true than it’s ok to say ma,btohqsg
It really depends on how fast u understand hahah,btohqsg
Honestly I just suggest you 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Yeah which is why people keep saying that only you know how much is enough for you,btohqsg
U understand the moment its being taught,btohqsg
If u fuck up with 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Ofc u dont need to study much,btohqsg
Mhm  if you manage to grasp the concept quickly  o level is a breeze.,btohqsg
I know people sleeping their entire lessons and lectures and still end up doing well for exam,btohqsg
The more impt thing is... even if u dont know how much u need to study u shoild at least start studying,btohqsg
U start now then u see how much MORE u need,btohqsg
He want be safer than sorry ma,btohqsg
u spend time asking people instead of acting on it,btohqsg
He maybe doing 20 hr days already,btohqsg
Okay lah true but i infer the opposite from what ive read sofar,btohqsg
i’d rather not blindly walk into something i know nothing about OR maybe i want to see where i stand amongst your answers,btohqsg
I just ballpark 10 hr per day for average joe,btohqsg
Everyone is different. To me studying 1hr a day was enuf. To someone else 3hrs is enuf others is 10hrs,btohqsg
There isnt a fixed answer everyone is different,btohqsg
Just give him one and end the topic,btohqsg
There is no definite answer to something subjective,btohqsg
Plus even if u decide to go with 10h a day  you also have to consider that you’ll burn out fast,btohqsg
if that’s what you make of it,btohqsg
Then 2 weeks b4 exam chill and don’t do shit,btohqsg
So there’s this sweet spot between 10h and 1h a day,btohqsg
Not only that. How much of the content u actuallt absorb and what do u do of that 10 hes,btohqsg
I know people who write notes for 3-5 hrs,btohqsg
Which is why hours is a silly measure of productivity,btohqsg
i realised  I have never made notes in my life,btohqsg
Notes are nice when I want to organise my knowledge,btohqsg
Get all the important formulas and shit in one place,btohqsg
The usefulness of making your own notes is dependent on individuals.,btohqsg
wait what have i made notes for,btohqsg
Thats why. Even if we give u mean hours to study after everyone has given their input. How u use those hours is on u. How much u retain is on u. How much u actually study depends on u,btohqsg
some answers are subjective  but it doesn’t mean i can’t gauge the premise of the answers so as to have a slightly vague idea lmao,btohqsg
I’ve done  15 hour days for two months,btohqsg
ah  reminds me of why i hated english and humanities,btohqsg
"At the same time  do you want us to control how you study? And you blindly following our ""orders""",btohqsg
my answers for english were always way off,btohqsg
He asking for advise only not asking us control him also,btohqsg
not exactly. i’m not very exposed to the system so i’m not sure what ‘too much’ is.,btohqsg
But I think end of the day is to find a studying method you prefer  not everyone would do notes tbh,btohqsg
I for myself  do reinforced learning ish. So something like putting answers on quizlet to memorise,btohqsg
I got tired of distilling 200 words from 15k words doc,btohqsg
Doing notes take a lot of time and effort,btohqsg
Back in secondary school  I find 1 hour of revision is too much. However  others think that it is too little.,btohqsg
How about you study until u give up and cant be productive anymore. That will be ur highest potential productivity.,btohqsg
Until u can effectively study that amount of time,btohqsg
yea I usually study until I give up,btohqsg
Ah gym  the good old gym,btohqsg
But somehow now  y effort doesn’t correlate with results much,btohqsg
And a lot of times I don’t even have control over my time and effort,btohqsg
If that doesnt work u need to ask these alr,btohqsg
What r u doing with ur HPPP,btohqsg
iirc AS levels is like the easier counterpart to the A levels,btohqsg
but its like 2 different exams,btohqsg
Effort is not the main factor,btohqsg
AS is just intermediary between nothing and A2,btohqsg
but it’s the factor i can’t control :),btohqsg
U dunno shit u ask someone who know shit to teach,btohqsg
Ah but like I'm curious what's the difference if I apply with a sg A level cert you know,btohqsg
I think unis dont take AS,btohqsg
I think in general H1s are ignored and H2s are equivalent to A Levels,btohqsg
How u long time no see,btohqsg
Wah International foundation after o level save a lot of years sia,btohqsg
Eh never seen that through my 'researching',btohqsg
Not rich enough to do that though,btohqsg
Ya I think foundation might be right for some ppl,btohqsg
But top courses don’t have foundation pipeline,btohqsg
oh my that would be REALLY REALLY helpful,btohqsg
Some have some don’t have la,btohqsg
Need a lot of money lol,btohqsg
Enter workforce at younger age seem quite cool,btohqsg
Huh where is this coming from,btohqsg
After o level can do international foundation,btohqsg
Actually is ok to be later La,btohqsg
Life is a marathon no need so chiong,btohqsg
U want baby so much wor,btohqsg
Difference is you prefer to study or work lol,btohqsg
I think going in early is a no brainer lol,btohqsg
If later but get better job,btohqsg
I think earlier more work experience,btohqsg
We all have our own pace,btohqsg
By pure financial standpoint if I don’t gap my yearly income should reach 60. I gap 1 year my yearly income jump to 150,btohqsg
Just curious are you the investment banking analyst,btohqsg
A lot of stuff is by luck one. Early late doesn’t matter too much,btohqsg
Unless late by 15 years or so hahha,btohqsg
I think need go back still,btohqsg
Ur discord can’t handle my speaking from pop level and kick me out,btohqsg
I'm back after dying from Physics,btohqsg
Got virtual internship too sia frominsidesherpa.com,btohqsg
Please don’t put that on linkedin,btohqsg
Got jp Morgan software engineering virtual internship sia,btohqsg
Can finish in 6 hours not counted as internship,btohqsg
But then again don’t put on LinkedIn,btohqsg
Not as work exp but as mooc bah,btohqsg
Anybody can join means no selection,btohqsg
Just don’t put under work exp,btohqsg
Some people shameless enough to do that lol,btohqsg
I just msg them tell them they are a joke,btohqsg
Where they laugh at ppl linkedin,btohqsg
There’s this lady I know she got flamed on that thread,btohqsg
I see some put student as work exp,btohqsg
And then WSO will joke about them,btohqsg
eh yall legit damn boliao ah,btohqsg
I work 14 hours a day holiday work 6 now chill a bit also boliao,btohqsg
Machiam lady boy if a lot of makeup sia,btohqsg
Maybe can convert but not expecting,btohqsg
Stack 4 internship from now to oct,btohqsg
Still sad never get through Carlyle,btohqsg
Finally someone knows what I’m talking about,btohqsg
Models dd and draft term shit,btohqsg
If there is no covid  does the firm offer you corporate housing in HK,btohqsg
Later in June will go traditional PE,btohqsg
Next year try mbb since got fast track to last round,btohqsg
Billion dollar deals need 5 ppl only,btohqsg
Haven’t meet billion dollar deals tho,btohqsg
I don’t think I’ve met anyone who does it,btohqsg
BX Carlyle don’t do distressed stuff,btohqsg
Oh u mean operating the company,btohqsg
Late for 12 mins but JAP is closed,btohqsg
But PE tend to separate deal team and value creation team,btohqsg
Value creation team they outsource to mbb,btohqsg
Does a lot of ceos come from mbb,btohqsg
Alot of bankers dunno how also,btohqsg
But they end up in pretty high places,btohqsg
Where u headed to in your career sia,btohqsg
Bankers has incomparable exits in finance only,btohqsg
Have coffee chat once this is over haha,btohqsg
"Someone said in reddit ""Fin is insanely competitive. Heard around that  some ppl are willing to intern without pay at some small investment firms.""",btohqsg
did u accept or did u not 🥵🥵🥵,btohqsg
With or without pay it's very hard to get,btohqsg
I cold emailed 1k plus plus ppl btw,btohqsg
My initial plan considering the appeal fails,btohqsg
Then can see the email format,btohqsg
Then search for names on LinkedIn and email accordingly,btohqsg
I still think sellside is invaluable,btohqsg
Buyside deals are smaller and as analyst u are doing nothing important,btohqsg
Then again u get more deal exp,btohqsg
And in interviews deal exp and the ability to bs about company profitability is priceless,btohqsg
This is for assoc interview in PE,btohqsg
PE doesn't really have structured training and extended networks,btohqsg
Maybe go sellside for half a year and recruit buyside,btohqsg
Eh not from what I hear,btohqsg
I've spoken to over 2 dozen ppl in BB and eb,btohqsg
It's just not directly relevant to buyside acumen,btohqsg
But the modelling exp is there,btohqsg
This can be found in MBB btw,btohqsg
UK and US banks recruit u on the assumption that u know nothing about modelling,btohqsg
SG banks are different I know,btohqsg
If can follow through an entire deal then confirm will have modelling exp,btohqsg
Nonetheless it's enuf to know what deals are going on and form an educated view,btohqsg
PE do more real shit and earn more and more stable,btohqsg
Better hours is very important lol,btohqsg
Not surprising to have 10k applicants for 1 pos,btohqsg
Eh u mean outsource to levfin in banks har,btohqsg
Most junior bankers dunno shit about unit economics,btohqsg
And the senior bankers are those who can't make it to pe,btohqsg
Sales is nothing to laugh at also,btohqsg
MD in PE also do sales,btohqsg
Entire biz of PE is in sales also,btohqsg
Sama sama in finance best resource u have is ur network,btohqsg
So sales is an essential skill,btohqsg
Sales and RS very related ma,btohqsg
Just that u are selling urself and ur cred in rs,btohqsg
Hahaha finally someone knows what shit I'm going through now,btohqsg
I never read much on recent deals btw sadz,btohqsg
See lv know it's l Chatterton le,btohqsg
No la I meant the recruiting,btohqsg
Think school helped a lot in PE recruiting,btohqsg
But not alot in IB recruiting,btohqsg
UK ib take ppl from not so elite school more than those from elite ones,btohqsg
Can't say not elite but can't say sibei elite,btohqsg
To ppl ox and cam has no diff,btohqsg
Eh to me only elite schools are hahvud Stanford and mit,btohqsg
My exp in school seems to support my point to a good extent also,btohqsg
My MIT Stanford huhvud friends ability rekt those in my school,btohqsg
HYPSM all should be first tier bah,btohqsg
I think largely influenced by their inadequacy in STEM ba,btohqsg
if you want talk about comp sci or engineering,btohqsg
Princeton more sciency but not CSy,btohqsg
berkeley can be considered first tier,btohqsg
Other than EECS they have nothing,btohqsg
yea their strengths are mainly in cs mah,btohqsg
That's why in CS the top school are mit Stanford cmu and ucb,btohqsg
But overall rep and ranking still only HSM,btohqsg
Oxbridge and the rest maybe second tier ba,btohqsg
But in terms of pure worth,btohqsg
I think nus ntu still best,btohqsg
the number of sg undergrads in HSM can probably be counted with both hands,btohqsg
While Oxbridge has 200 sgp a year,btohqsg
I almost ended up in Stanford,btohqsg
Tmr wait for ppl come flame me,btohqsg
anyone applied eae to Chinese study before ?,btohqsg
Did u do this when u were younger,btohqsg
Oh wait last seen 1 hr ago .-.,btohqsg
Oxford and Cambridge have a very long history together as rival unis  plus they are very similar  so people refer to them collectively,btohqsg
U can’t even apply to both unis at once,btohqsg
Because they’re so similar  one who applies to Cambridge would apply to Oxford too and vice versa  so each of them would have to deal with the admission workload of 2 unis,btohqsg
wait as in if you apply to one  youcan'tapply to the other?,btohqsg
So can just prevent people from selecting both unis as options,btohqsg
Probably need a lot of money to go this kind of uni lol,btohqsg
> imagine having such a strong rivalry that you don't even let students apply for the other school,btohqsg
imagine if u could only apply to NTU or NUS lol,btohqsg
It must be like hogwarts when you are a student in their campus lol,btohqsg
I believe the more practical reason is they don't want to double their workload,btohqsg
Cos their interviews are very intimate,btohqsg
Then if they want you and decide not to go,btohqsg
That's a damn waste of their time,btohqsg
That's why their yield rate is pretty high,btohqsg
Honestly if they allow ppl to apply for both,btohqsg
Their admission rate would half and that would make it as hard as Hahvud.,btohqsg
I thought the interview is purely academic,btohqsg
That would mean everyone from rj will get in wouldn't it,btohqsg
Still the rj admission rate is more like 1 in 4/5,btohqsg
For non stem 20k. Stem 30k,btohqsg
I want to smack myself for not choosing some easy humanities subject,btohqsg
JUST IN:Singapore reports 344 new COVID-19 cases  including 4 Singaporeans or permanent residents.The lower number is partly due to fewer tests being conducted  says the Ministry of Health.https://cna.asia/3gnYEf4,btohqsg
You tmr going back hta alrdy?,btohqsg
Altho i would want to go back tmr,btohqsg
I thought all BMT resume June 26,btohqsg
You’re an S I take it,btohqsg
wow humans actually cheaper than stem?,btohqsg
i not int in stem the first place,btohqsg
other than cuz people keep telling me no stem no future,btohqsg
After 2 june pop soon liao,btohqsg
chill la u dont have to do whatever u learn in college also,btohqsg
I thought John is xmm lol,btohqsg
no offence but the whole 'we need ns for women too' is so cringe,btohqsg
if i were a dude i'll just suck it up and do my ns without complaining or even worse dragging women into the equation,btohqsg
i think you're missing the point here.,btohqsg
lol that's their problem  just cuz someone is being a dumb sack doesnt mean u have to drop down to their level,btohqsg
if i were a guy i'd jolly well serve ns and not try and push it onto women too,btohqsg
no one is pushing it to women,btohqsg
That’s easy to say  I suppose,btohqsg
No one wants to do NS,btohqsg
guess no one has pride for their nation or want to protect it anymore,btohqsg
this one a bit extreme la,btohqsg
that's such a naive statement to make,btohqsg
if people forced u to do sth  the more likely u are to fight against it what,btohqsg
Everyone wants to protect their nation,btohqsg
But everyone would rather someone else do it,btohqsg
tbh even tho i complain abt NSi still take pride in what i do in camp,btohqsg
And if I could leave someone else to do 2 years work for me while I continue life  I would,btohqsg
May I take this moment to ask what have you done for the nation?,btohqsg
yeah i think its ok to complain  but taking some pride in what u do is nice too,btohqsg
what's the point of arguing all these,btohqsg
its technically allowance and not a salary,btohqsg
